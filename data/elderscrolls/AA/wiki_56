On the &lt;a href=\"Calendar%20%28Daggerfall%29\"&gt;1st of Morning Star&lt;/a&gt; the Prince of Bargains &lt;a href=\"Clavicus%20Vile\"&gt;Clavicus Vile&lt;/a&gt; may be summoned, if the Agent agrees to pay a summoner of either a &lt;a href=\"Witch%20Coven\"&gt;Witch Coven&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Mages%20Guild%20%28Daggerfall%29\"&gt;Mages Guild&lt;/a&gt; or a &lt;a href=\"Temples%20%28Daggerfall%29\"&gt;temple&lt;/a&gt;.\nWalkthrough.\nThe Agent may approach a summoner at either the &lt;a href=\"Mages%20Guild%20%28Daggerfall%29\"&gt;Mages Guild&lt;/a&gt;, a temple, or a witch coven to summon one of the Daedric Princes. If the summoning occurs on the 1st of Morning Star, the Agent may receive a vision of &lt;a href=\"Clavicus%20Vile\"&gt;Clavicus Vile&lt;/a&gt;, who immediately offers them a quest. Clavicus Vile states that \"a nasty little bit of fur\" has been attacking his \"friends,\" and so requests that the Agent destroys it, in return for a token of his power: The &lt;a href=\"Masque%20of%20Clavicus%20Vile%20%28Daggerfall%29\"&gt;Masque of Clavicus Vile&lt;/a&gt;.\nA Business Arrangement.\nHaving accepted Vile's request, the Agent is informed of the location of the \"bit of fur,\" a &lt;a href=\"Werewolf%20%28Daggerfall%29\"&gt;werewolf&lt;/a&gt;, as well as an apostle of the Prince, whom will hand the Agent their reward. With that, the Agent must head to and enter the dungeon in which the werebeast resides and slay it. However, the Agent may encounter several other werewolves, randomly generated among the usual &lt;a href=\"Creatures%20%28Daggerfall%29\"&gt;dungeon creatures&lt;/a&gt;, and so will have to keep killing until they receive this message:\n\"You have slain the werewolf, as ordered by Clavicus Vile.\"\nWith that, the Agent must meet with Clavicus Vile's apostle, whom lives in a town mentioned by the Prince. Speaking with the apostle before the time limit expires will complete the quest, with the Agent receiving the Masque in return for slaying the beast.\nRewards.\nCompleting the quest successfully within the time limit will see the Agent rewarded with the Masque of Clavius Vile by the Prince's apostle. The Agent will also receive a boost in reputation with the faction whom summoned the Prince for them, as well as the faction's associates. Conversely, failing the quest will result in the Agent losing reputation with the summoner's faction.\nThe changes made to reputation, either by successfully completing or failing the quest are shown below:"}

It's the name whispered in dark alleys as blood pools on the cobblestones, the signature on the ransom note left on a neighbor's bed. A shadow, a curse, a boil upon the arse of our society. And, though I'm not proud to admit it, it's a part of my past.\nNow, I'm not writing this for those of you already on the right side of the law. I'm writing this for the ones who have already ventured off that moral path, those that walk the thin line between wrong and right. The ones with empty bellies and emptier coffers, who might see the Camonna Tong as a viable option. To you I say, keep reading.\nSure, the Camonna Tong has stability. A steady stream of income is a hard thing to turn down, and they've got structure to boot. They'll lure you in with the possibility of glory, of command, of rising through the ranks. And sure, what they do is far from legal. But if you're already leaning in that direction, wouldn't you rather be in good company?\nIt didn't take much sweet talking before I signed right up, and at first life was good. Extorting the rich flat-heads who had lorded above me all my life? My pleasure! A few robberies, a few break-ins? Nothing I wasn't use to. And sure, we talked big about driving away the outlanders, of taking &lt;a href=\"Vvardenfell%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Vvardenfell&lt;/a&gt; back for the &lt;a href=\"Dunmer%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Dark Elves&lt;/a&gt;. But I'll be honest, nothing made me question what I was doing.\nNothing, that is, until some &lt;a href=\"Argonians%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Argonian&lt;/a&gt; seamstress got a little uppity.\nOh, it was the talk of the town. Some scaled n'wah had the gall to start up her own shop\u2014and be successful with it to boot! She was taking away good business from Dark Elves, that's what she was doing. Taking away gold from our mothers and sisters. So we did what the Camonna Tong does best. We made her pay.\nThe kidnapping was easy. Yeah, her shop was doing well, but she was still an Argonian. I don't think we saw a single guard as we slipped into her house, not in that part of town. We tied her up and gagged her before she had a chance to cry for help, laughing like it was some big joke. Young hotheads who had too much to drink. I thought we were just going to scare her, set her straight, make her realize that she couldn't think herself better.\nI started to sober up when the beatings began. First a slap to her face, but that quickly turned to punches and kicks. They joked about how she could take it, how Argonian skin was so thick no one would even see the bruises. I can still hear her muffled cries along with their laughter.\nI just watched as the beatings became more intense, as blood started dribbling from her gagged mouth. I wasn't a stranger to violence, or truly opposed to it given my line of work. But there was something about tying up this old Argonian and beating her bloody, kicking her as she fell to the floor. My throat grew tight as I watched, motionless. No one seemed to notice my lack of enthusiasm, so enraptured in the righteous justice they gladly doled out.\nSomeone pulled out a dagger and made the casual remark, \"You know, it's pretty hard to sew without fingers.\"\nSuddenly I was wide awake.\nI wish I could tell you that I stopped them. Said something clever, did something brave. But the truth is I walked out. I left that room, that town, that life. Not with my head held high, but broken, defeated, thinking of that poor Argonian's eyes, filled with terror. So different from my own, yet so alike. I don't know if they went through with it, if there's a fingerless beggar somewhere who sees my face in her nightmares. I don't think I'll ever try to find out.\nSo next time you think of the Camonna Tong, of the glamor and the gold? You think of how easy it is for your crooked morals to slip away entirely. How big talk and some drink can lead you down a darker path than you ever realized you were capable of. How easy it is to say nothing, and how much easier to just join along."}

I met a strange Dark Elf after I left &lt;a href=\"Mournhold%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Mournhold&lt;/a&gt;. His general demeanor was less aloof than others of his kind, though he still had that somewhat mistrustful air about him. I offered him some wine and bread at my campsite, and he seemed grateful enough for a little company.\nHe claimed to be a \"&lt;a href=\"Mabrigash%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Mabrigash&lt;/a&gt;,\" which I took to be some sort of &lt;a href=\"Ashlanders%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Ashlander&lt;/a&gt; clan off-shoot, though I was unaware that any clan had traveled this far south from &lt;a href=\"Vvardenfell%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Vvardenfell&lt;/a&gt;. I asked him about his journey, and he said he was going nowhere and anywhere. He said he couldn't return to the Vale.\nWhen I asked, he told me the &lt;a href=\"Vale%20of%20the%20Ghost%20Snake\"&gt;Vale&lt;/a&gt; was his home. He claimed his clan protected snakes and ghosts in this mysterious place. In turn, a \"&lt;a href=\"Ghost%20Snake%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Ghost Snake&lt;/a&gt;\" watched over the clan. Now, he was getting a bit drunk by this time, as we shared more than a bottle or two, but he assured me there was indeed a Ghost Snake. I asked why he left. He was silent for a long while. Finally, he mumbled that he had failed his &lt;a href=\"The%20Trial%20of%20the%20Ghost%20Snake\"&gt;trial&lt;/a&gt;. I asked what he meant and he said that he had not walked the path, that his courage had failed him and he had fled. \"Now I can never return,\" he told me. \"I have shamed my family and dishonored my clan.\"\nHe started to weep softly, so I pretended to busy myself with my packs, and a minute later he was snoring. Poor fellow. Obviously some primitive ritual or tribal rite had gone awry. I was determined to encourage him to return home when we broke camp in the morning. However, when I awoke at dawn, he was gone.\nI miss you as always. I will write again in a few days.\n\u2014 Thorgo"}

She requests that she teleport the Nerevarine to the &lt;a href=\"Clockwork%20City%20%28Tribunal%29\"&gt;Clockwork City&lt;/a&gt;, so that the Nerevarine may stop &lt;a href=\"Sotha%20Sil\"&gt;Sotha Sil&lt;/a&gt;, whose madness has led him to attack &lt;a href=\"Mournhold%20%28Tribunal%29\"&gt;Mournhold&lt;/a&gt; with his &lt;a href=\"Fabricant%20%28Tribunal%29\"&gt;Fabricant&lt;/a&gt; servants. Once the Nerevarine has accepted the quest, they will be immediately teleported to the &lt;a href=\"Clockwork%20City%20%28Tribunal%29\"&gt;Clockwork City&lt;/a&gt;, and will not be able to return until Sotha Sil has been dealt with.\nA City of Contraptions.\nJourneying through the Clockwork City reveals that the Nerevarine must be far more aware of its mechanics than just the hostile Fabricants that populate its various areas. Many levers are required to open doors, while numerous mechanical traps await the Nerevarine, these, in turn, may also be used to defeat the Fabricants.\nDomed Danger.\nThe Dome of Kasia is the first puzzle the Nerevarine will encounter. Inside, it is required to cross an area covered by a circular blade that swings rapidly around the room, making it impossible to reach the exit. The blade will cause instant death, and moves faster than the standard &lt;a href=\"Speed%20%28Morrowind%29\"&gt;run speed.&lt;/a&gt; The Nerevarine must use a fortify speed &lt;a href=\"Enchant%20%28Morrowind%29\"&gt;enchantment&lt;/a&gt; or several &lt;a href=\"Exclusive%20Fortify%20Speed\"&gt;Exclusive Fortify Speed&lt;/a&gt; potions to avoid it. Having outrun the blade, the Nerevarine progresses to the next room, the &lt;a href=\"Dome%20of%20Serlyn\"&gt;Dome of Serlyn&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe Dome of Serlyn has at its center two levers and two closed doors, one lever on the right opening the backdoor, and the other operating the front, the problem is, they cannot be operated together. The correct sequence is to open the backdoor, close the backdoor, open the front door, close the front door, wait for the pipes overhead to start moving, open the backdoor and run into the center area beyond the front door before the front door closes, possibly dealing with a fabricant that was summoned by the machine or just running passed it. The far wall is a door to the next area.\nBy contrast, the Dome of Udok features a relatively simple lava pit puzzle, where the Nerevarine must simply use a nearby lever for the bridge to unfold. However, unless the Nerevarine has a strength level of 100, the lever will be unmovable.\nThe penultimate Dome, the &lt;a href=\"Dome%20of%20the%20Imperfect\"&gt;Dome of the Imperfect&lt;/a&gt;, features two large constructs, the &lt;a href=\"Imperfect%20%28Tribunal%29\"&gt;Imperfects&lt;/a&gt;, guarding the entance to Sotha Sil's Dome. Although both seem inactive, as the Hero gets closer to the door, one will start moving and will attack the Nerevarine, the construct is extremely resilient and powerful. Once it has been destroyed, the Nerevarine may enter the &lt;a href=\"Dome%20of%20Sotha%20Sil\"&gt;Dome of Sotha Sil&lt;/a&gt; to deal with the demi-God that threatens Mournhold.\nThe True Mind of Madness.\nSotha Sil can be found held by contraptions and pipes in the centre of the Dome, dead. If interacted with, the Nerevarine is told that the area has been visited before, although there is little that they can do. However, when attempting to leave, Almalexia will materialise, and will give speech that reveals that she was behind the Fabricant attacks.\nShe will then attack the Nerevarine.\nAfter defeating and killing the former goddess, the Nerevarine will recover two items; Almalexia's sword &lt;a href=\"Hopesfire%20%28Tribunal%29\"&gt;Hopesfire&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Barilzar%27s%20Mazed%20Band%20%28Item%29\"&gt;Barilzar's Mazed Band&lt;/a&gt;. The Nerevarine may use the Band to return to Mournhold, emerging in the Temple.\nThe end.\nUpon exiting the Temple, the &lt;a href=\"Azura%27s%20Spirit\"&gt;Spirit&lt;/a&gt; of the &lt;a href=\"Daedric%20Princes\"&gt;Daedric Prince&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Azura\"&gt;Azura&lt;/a&gt; speaks to the Nerevarine, praising them and explaining that she rid Mournhold of the ashstorms to protect the Dunmer people.\n\"Optional:\" The Nerevarine may also speak to King Helseth in the &lt;a href=\"Royal%20Palace\"&gt;Royal Palace&lt;/a&gt; and explain their deeds. Impressed, the King will reward them with a full set of &lt;a href=\"Royal%20Guard%20Armor\"&gt;Royal Guard Armor&lt;/a&gt;, ending the Tribunal main quest."}

However, Sheogorath has left portals to Oblivion open throughout the realm, allowing Daedra to roam Eyevea. The doors to the Guild Hall are sealed by magic. Shalidor instructs the Vestige to close the portals while he tries to unseal the doors.\nInside the Guild Hall, Sheogorath instructs the Vestige to fight his chamberlain, Haskill. After the fight, Sheogorath makes an offer to take Valaste back with him to the Shivering Isles and in exchange the Vestige will receive the Folium Discognitum. If not, Sheogorath will cure Valaste of her madness instead but the Vestige will not receive the Folium.\nShalidor warns this is the exact same deal Sheogorath offered him years ago and pleads with the Vestige not to make the same mistake. Valaste is rather eager to go to the Shivering Isles. Ultimately, the decision is up to the Vestige. While the Vestige will receive a &lt;a href=\"skill%20point\"&gt;skill point&lt;/a&gt; at the conclusion of the quest regardless of their decision, the Folium Discognitum, if accepted, will grant the Vestige an additional two skill points."}

Depending on how the quest is resolved, it may spawn an additional quest that can affect the outcome.\nBackground.\n\"Athyn Sarethi told me that the Redoran Noble, Arethan Mandas, has gone insane and has been demanding tribute from travellers from the cavern Milk which is on the road to Maar Gan just north of the crossroads. I should find a way to cure him if possible, or kill him if necessary. He suggested that I speak with Arethan's father, Llerar Mandas in Ebonheart.\"\nWalkthrough.\nThe Nerevarine is informed by &lt;a href=\"Athyn%20Sarethi\"&gt;Athyn Sarethi&lt;/a&gt; of a former &lt;a href=\"House%20Redoran\"&gt;House Redoran Noble&lt;/a&gt; who has gone insane, &lt;a href=\"Arethan%20Mandas\"&gt;Arethan Mandas&lt;/a&gt;. Mandas had lost his sanity for an unknown reason and decided to set up a group of bandits to pluder travellers. The malevolent group is operating from a cavern named Milk, west of &lt;a href=\"Ald%27ruhn%20%28Morrowind%29\"&gt;Ald'ruhn&lt;/a&gt;. Sarethi requests that the Nerevarine find a solution to the problem of the \"Mad Lord of Milk.\" If questionned further, Athyn will inform that talking to Arethan's farther, who is the Redoran councilor in &lt;a href=\"Ebonheart%20%28Morrowind%29\"&gt;Ebonheart&lt;/a&gt;, may shed light on the reason why Arethan went mad.\nThe root of madness (Optional).\nLlerar Mandas.\nArethan Mandas' father, &lt;a href=\"Llerar%20Mandas\"&gt;Llerar Mandas&lt;/a&gt;, can be found in Ebonheart's &lt;a href=\"Grand%20Council%20Chambers\"&gt;Grand Council Chambers&lt;/a&gt;. He will reveal that his son's madness was caused by the kidnapping of Arethan's daughter, &lt;a href=\"Delyna%20Mandas\"&gt;Delyna Mandas&lt;/a&gt; by &lt;a href=\"Divayth%20Fyr%20%28Morrowind%29\"&gt;Divayth Fyr&lt;/a&gt;. He suggests that rescuing Delyna from &lt;a href=\"Tel%20Fyr%20%28Morrowind%29\"&gt;Tel Fyr&lt;/a&gt; may bring Arethan to his senses.\nRescuing Delyna Mandas.\nDelyna Mandas has been taken to the &lt;a href=\"House%20Telvanni%20%28Morrowind%29\"&gt;House Telvanni&lt;/a&gt; tower of Tel Fyr, on a small island, southwest of &lt;a href=\"Sadrith%20Mora%20%28Morrowind%29\"&gt;Sadrith Mora&lt;/a&gt;. If questionned about Delyna whereabouts, Divayth's daughter's will say that the Nerevarine must speak to their farther, Divayth. The latter will reveal that he has no recollection of who is Delyna. The Nerevarine must therefore rescue Delyna from her locked (level 60) room \u2014 This can be done by either an unlock &lt;a href=\"Spells%20%28Morrowind%29\"&gt;spell&lt;/a&gt;, or using &lt;a href=\"Lockpick%20%28Morrowind%29\"&gt;lockpicks&lt;/a&gt;, or by using Divayth's 1008th Key. No one will become hostile when walking away with Delyna. As the Hero and Delyna walk out, she will thank the Nerevarine and give them &lt;a href=\"Delyna%27s%20Locket\"&gt;her locket&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe mad lord.\nAfter journeying to the cavern named &lt;a href=\"Milk\"&gt;Milk&lt;/a&gt;, near Ald'ruhn, the nerevarine must find Arethan. Depending on their previous actions, there are two ways of dealing with Arethan:\nWithout the locket.\nArethan Mandas is, as his title suggests, quite mad. He can be heard saying the words 'Delyna Mandas' and 'Tel Fyr'. The Nerevarine must kill Mandas.\nWith the locket.\nTalking to Arethan about his daughter and giving him Delyna's locket will calm him down. He will, then, return to a relative state of sanity, and agree to stop attacking travelers on the roads near Milk. His guards will, from then on, become friendly towards the Nerevarine.\nReturn to Llerar Mandas.\n(Optional) If Delyna was freed and Arethan spared, the Hero may return to Llerar Mandas, in Ebonheart, in order to receive both his thanks and the &lt;a href=\"Ebony%20Closed%20Helm%20%28Morrowind%29\"&gt;Ebony Closed Helm&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe Nerevarine may now return to Athyn Sarethi to end the quest."}

In truth, these accounts are little more than \"victor's essays,\" a perspective narrowed by the &lt;a href=\"Empire\"&gt;Empire&lt;/a&gt;'s constant strife with the ancient, proud people that lived in this land far before Tiber Septim walked the soil of &lt;a href=\"Tamriel\"&gt;Tamriel&lt;/a&gt;. In light of this, I hope to create a more complete, accurate, and fair assessment of a group that has long suffered under the role of \"enemy,\" \"troublemakers,\" and \"them.\"\nLet us begin with the &lt;a href=\"Forsworn\"&gt;Forsworn&lt;/a&gt;, the so-called \"madmen\" of the Reach. The &lt;a href=\"Imperial%20Legion%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Imperial Legion&lt;/a&gt; classifies them as little more than brigands, noting their constant raids and ambushes within the Hold. But none of their military reports asks the question of \"why?\" If they were merely a group of bandits, surely they would be focused on acquiring gold and minimizing deaths among their own. But the opposite is true in Forsworn attacks. Large sums of coin are often left behind, and their fighters easily throw away their lives rather than risk capture by Imperial soldiers.\nIt is this incongruity that led me to &lt;a href=\"Markarth%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Markarth&lt;/a&gt;, the capital city of the Reach, in search of answers. There, I met one of the native peoples, an old woman who preferred to not be named in my writings. She told me of her family's long history. How she believes they originally came from &lt;a href=\"High%20Rock\"&gt;High Rock&lt;/a&gt;, home of the &lt;a href=\"Bretons%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Bretons&lt;/a&gt; (which would explain the similar faces and stature of the two peoples). How the Nords came and took their lands, their gods, and their culture from them. When asked about the Forsworn, the old woman would say that they are the \"real\" men and women of the Reach: those that refused to give in to the Nords. Those that still practiced the ancient traditions that the rest of their people had abandoned in exchange for peace.\nIn time, I was able to create trust with many more natives in my search that corroborated the old woman's story. By chance, one of them arranged a meeting between myself and what I thought was an elder member of his village. I was shocked to find that I was led to a camp, filled with the animal skulls, severed heads, and still beating hearts that I had read about from the military reports back in the &lt;a href=\"Imperial%20City\"&gt;Imperial City&lt;/a&gt;. There, I met Cortoran, a Forsworn, who seemed amused at the prospect of me writing down his story. Which I quote in full below:\n\"You want to know who the Forsworn are? We are the people who must pillage our own land. Burn our own ground. We are the scourge of the Nords. The axe that falls in the dark. The scream before the gods claim your soul. We are the true sons and daughters of the Reach. The spirits and hags have lived here from the beginning, and they are on our side. Go back. Go back and tell your Empire that we will have our own kingdom again. And on that day, we will be the ones burying your dead in a land that is no longer yours.\""}

Wayrest had been showered by much preference during the years before Pelagius' birth, for King &lt;a href=\"Magnus%20Septim\"&gt;Magnus&lt;/a&gt; was Antiochus' favorite brother.\nIt is hard to say when Pelagius' madness first manifested itself, for, in truth, the first ten years of his life were marked by much insanity in the land itself. When Pelagius was just over a year old, Antiochus died and a daughter, &lt;a href=\"Kintyra%20II\"&gt;Kintyra II&lt;/a&gt;, assumed the throne to the acclaim of all. Kintyra II was Pelagius' cousin and an accomplished mystic and sorceress. If she had sufficient means to peer into the future, she would have surely fled the palace.\nThe story of the &lt;a href=\"War%20of%20the%20Red%20Diamond\"&gt;War of the Red Diamond&lt;/a&gt; has been told in many other scholarly journals, but as most historians agree, Kintyra II's reign was usurped by her and Pelagius' cousin &lt;a href=\"Uriel%20Septim%20III\"&gt;Uriel&lt;/a&gt;, by the power of his mother, &lt;a href=\"Potema%20Septim\"&gt;Potema&lt;/a&gt;\u2014the so-called wolf queen of &lt;a href=\"Solitude\"&gt;Solitude&lt;/a&gt;. The year after her coronation, Kintyra was trapped in &lt;a href=\"Glenpoint\"&gt;Glenpoint&lt;/a&gt; and imprisoned in the &lt;a href=\"Imperial\"&gt;Imperial&lt;/a&gt; dungeons there.\nAll of Tamriel exploded into warfare as Prince Uriel took the throne as Uriel III, and &lt;a href=\"High%20Rock\"&gt;High Rock&lt;/a&gt;, because of the imprisoned Empress' presence there, was the location of some of the bloodiest battles. Pelagius' father, King Magnus, allied himself with his brother &lt;a href=\"Cephorus%20Septim\"&gt;Cephorus&lt;/a&gt; against the usurper Emperor, and brought the wrath of Uriel III and Queen Potema down on Wayrest. Pelagius, his brothers and sisters, and his mother &lt;a href=\"Utheilla%20Direnni\"&gt;Utheilla&lt;/a&gt; fled to the &lt;a href=\"Isle%20of%20Balfiera\"&gt;Isle of Balfiera&lt;/a&gt;. Utheilla was of the line of &lt;a href=\"Direnni%20Bloodline\"&gt;Direnni&lt;/a&gt;, and her family manse is still located on that ancient isle even to this day.\nThere is thankfully much written record of Pelagius' childhood in Balfiera recorded by nurses and visitors. All who met him described him as a handsome, personable boy, interested in sport, magic, and music. Even assuming diplomats' lack of candor, Pelagius seemed, if anything, a blessing to the future of the &lt;a href=\"Septim%20Dynasty\"&gt;Septim Dynasty&lt;/a&gt;.\nWhen Pelagius was eight, Cephorus slew Uriel III at the &lt;a href=\"Battle%20of%20Ichidag\"&gt;Battle of Ichidag&lt;/a&gt; and proclaimed himself Emperor Cephorus I. For the next ten years of his reign, Cephorus battled Potema. Pelagius' first battle was the &lt;a href=\"Siege%20of%20Solitude\"&gt;Siege of Solitude&lt;/a&gt;, which ended with Potema's death and the final end of the war. In gratitude, Cephorus placed Pelagius on the throne of Solitude.\nAs king of Solitude, Pelagius' eccentricities of behavior began to be noticeable. As a favorite nephew of the Emperor, few diplomats to Solitude made critical commentary about Pelagius. For the first two years of his reign, Pelagius was at the very least noted for his alarming shifts in weight. Four months after taking the throne, a diplomat from &lt;a href=\"Ebonheart\"&gt;Ebonheart&lt;/a&gt; called Pelagius \"a hale and hearty soul with a heart so big, it widens his waist\"; five months after that, the visiting princess of &lt;a href=\"Firsthold\"&gt;Firsthold&lt;/a&gt; wrote to her brother that \"the king's gripped my hand and it felt like I was being clutched by a skeleton. Pelagius is greatly emaciated, indeed.\"\nCephorus never married and died childless three years after the Siege of Solitude. As the only surviving sibling, Pelagius' father Magnus left the throne of Wayrest and took residence at the &lt;a href=\"Imperial%20City\"&gt;Imperial City&lt;/a&gt; as the Emperor Magnus I. Magnus was elderly and Pelagius was his oldest living child, so the attention of Tamriel focused on Solitude. By this time, Pelagius' eccentricities were becoming infamous.\nThere are many legends about his acts as King of Solitude, but few well-documented cases exist. It is known that Pelagius locked the young princes and princesses of &lt;a href=\"Silvenar%20%28City%29\"&gt;Silvenar&lt;/a&gt; in his room with him, only releasing them when an unsigned Declaration of War was slipped under the door. When he tore off his clothes during a speech he was giving at a local festival, his advisors apparently decided to watch him more carefully. On the orders of Magnus, Pelagius was married to the beautiful heiress of an ancient &lt;a href=\"Dark%20Elf\"&gt;Dark Elf&lt;/a&gt; noble family, &lt;a href=\"Katariah%20Ra%27athim\"&gt;Katariah Ra'athim&lt;/a&gt;.\n&lt;a href=\"Nord\"&gt;Nord&lt;/a&gt;ic kings who marry Dark Elves seldom improve their popularity. There are two reasons most scholars give for the union. Magnus was trying to cement relations with &lt;a href=\"Ebonheart\"&gt;Ebonheart&lt;/a&gt;, where the Ra'athim clan hailed. Ebonheart's neighbor, &lt;a href=\"Mournhold\"&gt;Mournhold&lt;/a&gt;, had been a historical ally of the Empire since the very beginning, and the royal consort of Queen &lt;a href=\"Barenziah\"&gt;Barenziah&lt;/a&gt; had won many battles in the &lt;a href=\"War%20of%20the%20Red%20Diamond\"&gt;War of the Red Diamond&lt;/a&gt;. Ebonheart had a poorly-kept secret of aiding Uriel III and Potema.\nThe other reason for the marriage was more personal: Katariah was as shrewd a diplomat as she was beautiful. If any creature was capable of hiding Pelagius' madness, it was she.\nOn the 8th of Second Seed, &lt;a href=\"3E%20145\"&gt;3E 145&lt;/a&gt;, Magnus I died quietly in his sleep. &lt;a href=\"Jolethe%20Direnni\"&gt;Jolethe&lt;/a&gt;, Pelagius' sister took over the throne of Solitude, and Pelagius and Katariah rode to the Imperial City to be crowned Emperor and Empress of Tamriel. It is said that Pelagius fainted when the crown was placed on his head, but Katariah held him up so only those closest to the thrones could see what had happened. Like so many Pelagius stories, this cannot be verified.\nPelagius Septim III never truly ruled Tamriel. Katariah and the &lt;a href=\"Elder%20Council\"&gt;Elder Council&lt;/a&gt; made all the decisions and only tried to keep Pelagius from embarrassing all. Still, stories of Pelagius Septim III's reign exist.\nIt was said that when the &lt;a href=\"Argonian\"&gt;Argonian&lt;/a&gt; ambassador from &lt;a href=\"Blackrose\"&gt;Blackrose&lt;/a&gt; came to court, Pelagius insisted on speaking in all grunts and squeaks, as that was the Argonian's natural language.\nIt is known that Pelagius was obsessed with cleanliness, and many guests reported waking to the noise of an early-morning scrubdown of the Imperial Palace. The legend of Pelagius while inspecting the servants' work, suddenly defecating on the floor to give them something to do, is probably apocryphal.\nWhen Pelagius began actually biting and attacking visitors to the Imperial Palace, it was decided to send him to a private asylum. Katariah was proclaimed regent two years after Pelagius took the throne. For the next six years, the Emperor stayed in a series of institutions and asylums.\nTraitors to the Empire have many lies to spread about this period. Whispered stories of hideous experiments and tortures performed on Pelagius have almost become accepted as fact. The noble lady Katariah became pregnant shortly after the Emperor was sent away, and rumors of infidelity and, even more absurd, conspiracies to keep the sane Emperor locked away, ran amok. As Katariah proved, her pregnancy came about after a visit to her husband's cell. With no other evidence, as loyal subjects, we are bound to accept the Empress' word on the matter. Her second child, who would reign for many years as &lt;a href=\"Uriel%20IV\"&gt;Uriel IV&lt;/a&gt;, was the child of her union with her consort &lt;a href=\"Lariate\"&gt;Lariate&lt;/a&gt;, and publicly acknowledged as such.\nOn a warm night in &lt;a href=\"Suns%20Dawn\"&gt;Suns Dawn&lt;/a&gt;, in his 34th year, Pelagius Septim III died after a brief fever in his cell at the Temple of &lt;a href=\"Kynareth\"&gt;Kynareth&lt;/a&gt; in the Isle of &lt;a href=\"Betony\"&gt;Betony&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href=\"Katariah%20I\"&gt;Katariah I&lt;/a&gt; reigned for another forty six years before passing the scepter onto the only child she had with Pelagius, &lt;a href=\"Cassynder%20Septim\"&gt;Cassynder Septim&lt;/a&gt;.\nPelagius' wild behavior has made him perversely dear to the province of his birth and death. The 2nd of Suns Dawn, which may or may not be the anniversary of his death (records are not very clear) is celebrated as Mad Pelagius Day, the time when foolishness of all sorts is encouraged. And so, one of the least desirable Emperors in the history of the Septim Dynasty, has become one of the most famous ones."}

The tower has recently been opened and its resident and master, the &lt;a href=\"Celestial%20Mage\"&gt;Celestial Mage&lt;/a&gt;, is ready to ward off any would-be plunderers.\nBackground.\n\"I've discovered the Aetherian Archive, an enigmatic tower that had previously been sealed. Mighty Mordra and her Undaunted had planned to climb the Archive, but her allies are missing. If I choose to, I could explore it and reach the top before them.\"\nWalkthrough.\nThis walkthrough is written for normal difficulty. experiences on veteran may differ. \nIn the Aetherian Archive, you will find a woman named Mighty Mordra. She will tell you that this tower has recently opened up, and that she and her fellow &lt;a href=\"Undaunted\"&gt;Undaunted&lt;/a&gt; have attempted an exploration, but that her companions have not returned. This will start the quest. Note that you cannot do this quest with fewer than 12 players. \nHead through the door into the archive proper. You will find yourself in a library. As you proceed through the hallway, &lt;a href=\"The%20Mage%20%28Celestial%29\"&gt;the Celestial Mage&lt;/a&gt; will appear and warn you not to proceed, due to the dangers ahead. Do not heed her warning; press on and you will encounter some fire traps. Navigate your way through and fight through the horde of &lt;a href=\"Flame%20Atronach%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Flame Atronachs&lt;/a&gt; that follow. Head on to the next room and you will find it frozen over, with small ice cyclones hovering across the ground. these will trap you in place, but you can just dodge roll out of them. There are some &lt;a href=\"Frost%20Atronach%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Frost Atronachs&lt;/a&gt; on the other side, so make sure to dispatch those. The mage will again try to warn you off here and will do so numerous more times throughout the dungeon, but do not let her dissuade you. \nProceed on until you reach an outdoor area. There will be a horde of &lt;a href=\"Firstmages\"&gt;Firstmages&lt;/a&gt; here waiting to assault you; fight your way through. Proceed along the path to reach the first boss, the &lt;a href=\"Lightning%20Storm%20Atronach\"&gt;Lightning Storm Atronach&lt;/a&gt;. This fight is fairly straightforward; just beat him until he drops. After the atronach is dead, the group should stand on the stone markings on the floor; every marking must have a player on it. Only once every player has taken their position will you be teleported to the next part of the dungeon. \nThe group will be split up and will be attacked by a few mages. Kill them, then head ahead and rendezvous with the other players before the next set of markings on the floor; same deal as before, everyone has to get on a marking. You will not be split up this time; just head ahead, kill the enemies and again get on the markings. After this third time, you will see the next boss up ahead, the &lt;a href=\"Foundation%20Stone%20Atronach\"&gt;Foundation Stone Atronach&lt;/a&gt;. Here, the tank should keep him facing away from the group, but other than that, just keep hitting him until he drops. Once the big pile of rocks is dead, head ahead to the next teleporter pads.\nThese pads will again split the group and launch you straight into a fight. This time, you are dealing with multiple waves of enemies; kill them all, then head on to the rendezvous point. Head up the stone slopes from here, then down the slope on the other side to reach the next boss, the wispmother &lt;a href=\"Varlariel\"&gt;Varlariel&lt;/a&gt;. Varlariel also does not have any complex mechanics you need to be aware of; just beat her until she dies. Once Varlariel is dead, proceed on across the narrow stone bridge and make your way into the library tower ahead. You will see one more set of teleporter pads here; these will take you to the battlefield where you will face the Mage herself. \nYou will first have to kill some minor enemies before the big boss will appear. Once the Mage shows up, make sure that she is facing away from the group, and keep up the damage output. Once the Mage has been defeated, you will witness a scene where she is freed of her corruption. The dialogue here will differ based on whether you have previously beaten \"&lt;a href=\"Assaulting%20the%20Citadel\"&gt;Assaulting the Citadel&lt;/a&gt;\" and \"&lt;a href=\"The%20Oldest%20Ghost\"&gt;The Oldest Ghost&lt;/a&gt;\".\nReturn through the portal to the entrance and speak with &lt;a href=\"Mindil%20the%20Untested\"&gt;Mindil the Untested&lt;/a&gt; to finish the quest."}

Now, over two months since the last encounter, Greyman contacts the Agent using his trained raven for one last jaunt.\nWalkthrough.\nBetween 62 and 97 days after the conclusion of the previous quest, the Agent will be contacted by a trained raven, which will deposit a message onto their person. This message instructs the Agent to travel to another town and meet Baltham Greyman in a tavern. Once there, the Agent will be greeted by Greyman who offers them another chance to undermine the Mages Guild:\nAccepting the quest will allow Greyman to detail his \"project\", while rejecting the offer will end the quest outright.\nA Mage's Map.\nGreyman's plan centres on the acquisition of a specific map, which the Mages Guild has recently obtained, although they do not know what it reveals. The Agent, with Greyman accompanying them, must head to the specified town and break into the Mages Guild Guildhall to conduct the search. The Map will be found lying on the floor somewhere within the Guildhall, with conformation of its discovery coming when Greyman exclaims:\nHowever, before the Agent and Greyman can escape, they must first fight through a trio of mercenary mages, sent to protect the map for the Guild. Should the suffle last more than a few moments, Greyman will teleport the Agent and himself out of the Guildhall stating:\nOnce outside, Greyman will reveal the second phase of his quest.\n(Optional) A Magical Key.\nGreyman will reveal that a magical key, a specific but otherwise random &lt;a href=\"Items%20%28Daggerfall%29\"&gt;item&lt;/a&gt;, is needed to open the final dungeon. He offers the Agent the chance to find the key themselves, although he is prepared to do so himself. There is no reward for retrieving the key, other than loot that can be obtained from the key's dungeon.\nThe Final Dungeon.\nOnce the key has been obtained, either by the Agent or Greyman, the Agent will have to wait for Greyman in the tavern they originally met in at the start of the quest. Once Greyman arrives he will reveal the next, and final part of his plan, stating:\nUsing the map while the key is in the Agent's inventory will reveal the location of the dungeon on the Agent's world map. After journeying to and then entering the final dungeon, the Agent, with Greyman, will have to search for the target item. However, at some point during the search, the Agent and Greyman will encounter a &lt;a href=\"Battlemage%20%28Enemy%29\"&gt;battlemage&lt;/a&gt;, who states:\nThe Agent and Greyman must kill the battlemage and loot the item from their remains before escaping the dungeon.\nA Final Encounter.\nOnce outside the dungeon, Greyman will ask the Agent to hand him the item, with the Agent having the option to hand it over, or keep it for themselves. Handing over the item will complete the quest, while rejecting his offer will cause Greyman to exclaim:\nThe Agent must fight and kill their \"friend\" to keep the item. However, regardless of whether the Agent gave Greyman the item, or killed him, it will be the last time the two meet.\nRewards.\nThe Agent will receive a random amount of for completing the quest successfully, although they can also obtain the magical item by slaying Greyman. The only reputation related changes result from the raid on the Mages Guild, regardless of later success or failure:"}

A scholar named Telenger is in charge.\"\nWalkthrough.\nThis quest be started by talking to &lt;a href=\"Parmtilir\"&gt;Parmtilir&lt;/a&gt; outside the ruins, or by going to Telenger directly. Telenger will be in the camp near the ruins; there is also a copy of the lorebook \"&lt;a href=\"Why%20Don%20the%20Veil%3F\"&gt;Why Don the Veil?&lt;/a&gt;\" in the south of his camp, so be sure to pick that up. Telenger will tell you that some of his team have gone into the ruins looking for something called the Mallari-Mora, but they have not come back. He will task you with finding out what happened to them.\nHead northeast. Along the way, you will run into a woman named &lt;a href=\"Sirinque\"&gt;Sirinque&lt;/a&gt;, who will give you the quest \"&lt;a href=\"An%20Act%20of%20Kindness\"&gt;An Act of Kindness&lt;/a&gt;.\" That quest takes place in the same area as this one, so it can be efficient to do both simultaneously. Further northeast, you will find &lt;a href=\"Andewen\"&gt;Andewen&lt;/a&gt; and some other mages. The mages are crafting a barrier of some sort. Speak with Andewen and she will tell you that some of her men were taken by the ghosts, probably to the undercroft. She will tell you that in order to enter the ruins proper, you need two runes that together form a key. One of these, the Rune of Xarxes, is in the structure just up the hill to the west. For the Rune of Magnus, head to the east side of the ruins.\nOnce you have both of the runes, head to the undercroft, which is northeast of where you found the Rune of Magnus. There, speak with Andewen and she will use the runes to unlock the door. Head in and proceed through the hallway; you will find one of the researchers, &lt;a href=\"Meldil\"&gt;Meldil&lt;/a&gt;, a bit ahead. He will tell you that a man called &lt;a href=\"Uricantar\"&gt;Uricantar&lt;/a&gt; has trapped the other researchers and is trying to open a portal to &lt;a href=\"Aetherius\"&gt;Aetherius&lt;/a&gt; using the Mallari-Mora. Your task now is to release or kill the researchers to prevent this from happening. They will be in the two northern rooms of the ruins.\nYou will now have the option to either kill the researchers, or to enter the spirit realm and rescue them. If you choose the latter option, you will need to enter an &lt;a href=\"Aetherial%20Gateway\"&gt;Aetherial Gateway&lt;/a&gt; in order to leave the Spirit Realm.\nOnce all the researchers are either dead or freed, head back to Andewen and tell her you have freed everyone. She will thank you and ask you to put an end to Uricantar. Uricantar will be in the south of the ruins, in the Inner Sanctum. You will run into a projection of his as you enter; speak with him and he will tell you that he intends to just trap new people after he has killed you, and he will taunt you to come deeper into the ruins and face him. Head to the big southern chamber and you will find Uricantar there along with &lt;a href=\"Thundermaul\"&gt;Thundermaul&lt;/a&gt;; both will be hostile. Once you have killed them, take the Mallari-Mora from Uricantar's body.\nHead outside and take the Mallari-Mora to Telenger to finish the quest."}

It is given by &lt;a href=\"Falk%20Firebeard\"&gt;Falk Firebeard&lt;/a&gt;, Steward to &lt;a href=\"Elisif%20the%20Fair\"&gt;Jarl Elisif&lt;/a&gt; at &lt;a href=\"Solitude%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Solitude&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href=\"Varnius%20Junius\"&gt;Varnius Junius&lt;/a&gt;, a representative from &lt;a href=\"Dragon%20Bridge%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Dragon Bridge&lt;/a&gt;, nervously and impatiently pleaded to the court in Solitude for help investigating &lt;a href=\"Wolfskull%20Cave\"&gt;Wolfskull Cave&lt;/a&gt; due to rumors of inexplicable disappearances and strange lights, but so far has only received reinforced guard patrols.\nBackground.\n\"A representative from Dragon Bridge has appealed to the court in Solitude for help investigating Wolfskull Cave. Falk Firebeard has asked me to clear out the cave.\"\nWalkthrough.\nUpon entering the &lt;a href=\"Blue%20Palace%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Blue Palace&lt;/a&gt; for the first time, the &lt;a href=\"Last%20Dragonborn\"&gt;Dragonborn&lt;/a&gt; will encounter Varnius Junius begging for something to be done about Wolfskull Cave. Elisif will promise that Falk Firebeard will see to the matter, calming Varnius as he leaves. Upon speaking with Falk, he will admit he was planning on ignoring the plea, however he will offer a reward if the Dragonborn decides to help. After agreeing to investigate the cave, the quest proper will begin, directing the Dragonborn to Wolfskull Cave nearby Dragon Bridge.\nAfter entering the cave, the path starts north, gradually turns to the right, then sharply left (northwest). After a &lt;a href=\"Draugr%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;draugr&lt;/a&gt; is dispatched, the path turns slightly right (north). Two &lt;a href=\"Necromancer%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;necromancers&lt;/a&gt; are sitting in front of a cook fire to the left (northwest), and wooden door opens to the north.\nDown the steps beyond the door is a room with several enemies, including a &lt;a href=\"Frost%20Atronach%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;frost atronach&lt;/a&gt;, depending on player level, otherwise, it will be a necromancer, skeleton, and high-level draugr, like a &lt;a href=\"Draugr%20Wight%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Draugr Wight&lt;/a&gt;. In the center of the room is a sinkhole. After jumping down the sinkhole, the passage leads north-northwest to Wolfskull Ruins.\nTo the north is another overlook, where necromancers and the &lt;a href=\"Ritual%20Master\"&gt;Ritual Master&lt;/a&gt; can be heard chanting a summoning spell for the long-dead &lt;a href=\"Potema%20Septim\"&gt;Potema Septim&lt;/a&gt;, the \"Wolf Queen.\" The ghostly form of Potema is at the top of a tower.\nAnother passage to the left (west) leads to the bottom. Alternatively, it is possible to jump down carefully to the right from the overlook (if the Dragonborn turns left they will fall and be teleported to the bottom of the sinkhole).\nAt the bottom of the steps are several enemies, then a curved set of steps leads up to the east, curving eventually to the west. At the top is a satchel against the right-hand wall, and an opening leads east. Another set of steps leads up to the northeast. At the first landing are numerous leveled draugr and necromancers. The next set of steps leads to a second landing where the path turns left (northwest). Another set of steps leads up to the northwest, then west. At the top of those steps is a walkway with another draugr, maybe a necromancer patrolling with them.\nThe walkway leads generally east, then to a final curved set of steps up to the top of the tower where the necromantic ritual to bind Potema is happening. The necromancers who are conducting the ceremony can be killed to interrupt the resurrection. Alternatively, if the Dragonborn has not killed the draugr on the way in, they will begin to attack the necromancers shortly after reaching the ritual circle, provided the Dragonborn has a high enough Sneak skill. Sneaking and waiting is sufficient for the draugr to kill the necromancers, and begin the next phase of the quest. Otherwise, go ahead and kill the necromancers yourself, including the Ritual Master. Once they are all dead, including the Ritual Master, Potema's spirit escapes. She will be dealt with later. A lever to the left of a drawbridge drops it, creating a path southeast to the next tower. There is a boss level chest against the southeast wall of the second tower top, and a set of stairs leading down. At the bottom, a path leads southeast to a door back to Wolfskull Cave. Beyond the door, it is possible to jump down next to the cart in the initial small cavern, then exit the cave.\nReturning to Falk allows him to give the reward. Now the key to the Pelagius Wing can be received from him for the &lt;a href=\"Daedric%20Quests%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Daedric quest&lt;/a&gt; \"&lt;a href=\"The%20Mind%20of%20Madness\"&gt;The Mind of Madness&lt;/a&gt;.\"\nAfter completing the quest, Falk Firebeard may send a letter to the Dragonborn via courier asking for help after more information has been uncovered about the events in the cave regarding Potema. Speaking to him then begins the sequel quest \"&lt;a href=\"The%20Wolf%20Queen%20Awakened\"&gt;The Wolf Queen Awakened&lt;/a&gt;.\"\nTrivia.\nRitual master \"Potema, hear our call and awaken. We summon you!\"\"\nAll summoners together \"We summon Potema!\"\"\nRitual master \"Long have you dreamed the dreamless sleep of death, Potema. No longer. Hear our call and awaken. We summon you!\"\"\nAll summoners together \"We summon Potema!\"\"\nThen, when going underneath two towers connected by a bridge:\nPotema \"Yes, YES! Return me to this realm!\"\"\nRitual master \"As our voices summon you, the blood of the innocent binds you, Wolf Queen!\"\"\nPotema \"What? What are you doing?\"\"\nAll summoners together \"Summoned with words, bound by blood.\"\"\nPotema \"You ants don't have the power to bind ME!\"\"\nAll summoners together \"Summoned with words, bound by blood.\"\""}

Translations of tapestries in the &lt;a href=\"Crystal%20Tower%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Crystal Tower&lt;/a&gt; tell the tale of a far older separation. The Maormer likely differentiated from the ancient &lt;a href=\"Aldmer\"&gt;Aldmer&lt;/a&gt; not in Summerset, but in their original homeland of &lt;a href=\"Aldmeris\"&gt;Aldmeris&lt;/a&gt;.\n&lt;a href=\"Orgnum\"&gt;Orgnum&lt;/a&gt;, their leader and self-styled \"King,\" according to the legend was a phenomenally wealthy Aldmeri nobleman, who used his fortune to finance a rebellion against the powers of the land. He and his followers were banished for this to a place separated from Aldmeris by an impenetrable mist, Pyandonea, \"The Mist-Veiled Isles.\" This exile proved so effective that the followers of Orgnum never again disturbed their former countrymen. The new Aldmeri homeland of Summerset, however, was not so lucky.\nFor much of Summerset's history, the Maormer have launched attacks against their cousins of &lt;a href=\"Old%20Ehlnofey\"&gt;Old Ehlnofey&lt;/a&gt;. Every one of these battles has been led by Orgnum himself, who it seems is not only immortal but grows more youthful by the century. No historian, to the knowledge of the staff of the &lt;a href=\"Imperial%20Geographic%20Society\"&gt;Imperial Geographic Society&lt;/a&gt;, has counted the number of wars and strategems employed against Summerset, but somehow each has proved, no matter how ingenious, an ultimate failure.\nOne attack in particular is worthy of mention as it gives us our only glimpse into the actual landscape of Pyandonea. In the year &lt;a href=\"2E%20486\"&gt;2E 486&lt;/a&gt;, a small Maormeri fleet was sighted off the coast of &lt;a href=\"Alinor\"&gt;Alinor&lt;/a&gt;, and King &lt;a href=\"Hidellith\"&gt;Hidellith&lt;/a&gt; ordered his navy to give chase. The navy followed the ships through uncharted waters, into an ambush near Pyandonea itself. Most of the &lt;a href=\"Altmer%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Altmeri&lt;/a&gt; navy was destroyed, but a single warship returned to Summerset to describe the land as a \"sea jungle.\" Massive plateaus spilling over with vegetation form mazes around valleys of ocean. Waving tendrils of kelp trap all but the Maormer's own ships, and provide a well-camouflaged home for the sea serpents that are Orgnum's guards and occasional mounts. Mist storms spill over the land, further disorienting one's views. That even one ship survived the visit is a testament to the maritime genius of the Altmer."}

Every slave he bought on the day he bought him or her was soundly whipped in the courtyard for a period of one to three hours, depending on the individual degree of independent spirit. The whip he used\u2014or had his castellan use\u2014was of wet, knotted cloth, which regularly drew blood but very seldom maimed. To his great satisfaction and personal pride, few slaves ever needed to be whipped more than once. The memory of their first day, and the sight and sound of every subsequent slave's first day, stayed with them throughout their lives.\nWhen Brin bought his first &lt;a href=\"Bosmer\"&gt;Bosmer&lt;/a&gt; slave, he ordered his castellan to whip him only for an hour. The creature, which Brin had named Dob, seemed so much more delicate than the &lt;a href=\"Argonian\"&gt;Argonian&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Khajiit\"&gt;Khajiit&lt;/a&gt;i and &lt;a href=\"Orsimer\"&gt;Orcs&lt;/a&gt; who made up the bulk of his slaves. Dob was clearly ill suited for work in the mines or in the fields, but he seemed presentable enough for domestic service.\nDob did his work quietly and tolerably well. Brin occasionally had to correct him by refusing him food, but the punishment never needed to go further. Whenever guests arrived at the plantation, the sight of the exotic and elegant addition to Brin's household staff always impressed them.\n\"Here, you,\" said Genethah Illoc, a minor but still noble member of the &lt;a href=\"House%20Indoril\"&gt;House Indoriil&lt;/a&gt; (sic), as Dob presented her with a glass of wine. \"Were you born a slave?\"\n\"No, sedura,\" Dob answered with a bow. \"I used to rob nice ladies like you on the road.\"\nThe company all laughed with delight, but Kelmeril Brin checked with the slave trader from whom he had bought Dob, and found that the story was true. The Bosmer had been a highwayman, though not one of any great notoriety, before he had been caught and sold into slavery as punishment. It seemed so extraordinary that a quiet fellow like Dob, who always looked respectfully downward at the sight of his superiors, could have been a criminal. Brin made up his mind to question him about it.\n\u201cYou must have used some sort of weapon when you were robbing all those pilgrims and merchants,\u201d Brin grinned as he watched Dob mop.\n\u201cYes, sedura,\u201d Dob replied humbly. \u201cA bow.\u201d\n\u201cOf course. You Bosmeri are supposed to be very handy with those,\u201d Brin thought a moment and then asked: \u201cA bit of a marksman, were you?\u201d\nDob nodded humbly.\n\u201cYou will tutor my son Wodilic in archery,\u201d the master said after another moment's pause. Wodilic was twelve years of age and had been rather sadly spoiled by his mother, Brin's late wife. The boy was useless at swordplay, fearful of being cut. He embarrassed his father's pride, but the personality defect seemed ideally suited to the bow. Brin had his castellan purchase a finely wrought bow, several quivers of arrows, and ordered targets to be set up in the wildflower field next to the plantation house. In a few days time, the lessons began.\nFor the first few days, the master watched Wodilic and Dob to be certain that the slave knew how to teach. He was pleased to see the boy learn the grips and the different stances. Business concerns, however, had to take precedence. Brin only had time to see to it that the lessons were continuing, but not how well they were progressing.\nIt was a month's time before the issue was reexamined. Brin and his castellan were reviewing the plantation's earnings and expenses, and they had come to the area of miscellaneous household costs.\n\u201cYou might also check to see how many targets in the field need to be repaired.\u201d\n\u201cI have already anticipated that, sedura,\u201d said the castellan. \u201cThey are in pristine condition.\u201d\n\u201cHow is that possible?\u201d Brin shook his head. \u201cI've seen targets fall apart after only a few good shots. There shouldn't be anything left after a month's worth of lessons.\u201d\n\u201cThere are no holes of any kind in the targets, sedura. See for yourself.\u201d\nAs it happened at that hour, the marksmanship lesson was underway. Brin walked across the field, watching Dob guide Wodilic's arm as the boy took aim at the sky. The arrow flew up into an arc, over the top of the target, burying itself in the ground. Brin examined the target and found it to be, as his castellan said, in pristine condition. No arrow had touched it.\n\u201cMaster Wodilic, you must pull your right arm down further,\u201d Dob was saying. \u201cAnd the follow-through is essential if you expect your arrow to gain any height.\u201d\n\u201cHeight?\u201d Brin snarled. \u201cWhat about accuracy? Unless he's been secretly racking up a high kill ratio on birds, you haven't taught my son a thing about marksmanship.\u201d\nDob bowed humbly. \u201cSedura, first Master Wodilic must become comfortable with the weapon before he need worry about accuracy. In Valenwood, we learn by watching the bolt arc at different levels, in different winds, before we try very hard to strike targets.\u201d\nBrin's face turned purple with fury: \u201cI'm not a fool! I should have known not to trust a slave with my boy's education!\u201d\nThe master grabbed Dob and shoved him toward the plantation house. Dob, head down, began the humble, shuffling walk he had learned in his domestic duties. Wodilic, tears streaming down his face, tried to follow.\n\u201cYou stay and practice!\u201d roared his father. \u201cTry aiming at the target itself, not at the sky! You are not coming back into the house until there is one hole in that damned bullseye!\u201d\nThe boy tearfully returned to practice, while Brin brought Dob into the courtyard and called for his whip. Dob suddenly broke away and scrambled to hide between some barrels in the center of the yard.\n\u201cTake your punishment, slave! I should have never shown you mercy the day I bought you!\u201d Brin bellowed, bringing the whip down on Dob's exposed back again and again. \u201cI have to toughen you up! There'll be no more soft jobs as tutor and valet in your future!\u201d\nWodilic's plaintive yell drifted in from the meadow: \u201cI can't! Father, I can't hit it!\u201d\n\u201cMaster Wodilic!\u201d Dob cried back as loud as he could, his voice shaking with pain. \u201cKeep your left arm straight and aim slightly east! The wind has changed!\u201d\n\u201cStop confusing my son!\u201d Brin screamed. \u201cYou'll be in the &lt;a href=\"saltrice\"&gt;saltrice&lt;/a&gt; fields if I don't beat you to death first! Like you deserve!\u201d\n\u201cDob!\u201d the boy wailed, far away. \u201cI still can't hit it!\u201d\n\u201cMaster Wodilic! Take four steps back, aim east, and don't be afraid of the height!\u201d Dob tore away from the barrels, hiding under a cart near the wall. Brin pursued him, raining down blows.\nThe boy's arrow sailed high over the target and kept climbing, reaching a pinnacle at the edge of the plantation house before coming down in a magnificent arc. Brin tasted the blood before he realized he'd been hit. Gingerly, he raised his hands and felt the arrowhead protruding out of the back of his neck. He looked at Dob crouching under the wagon, and thought he saw a thin smile cross the slave's lips. Just for an instant before he died, Brin saw the face of the rogue highwayman on Dob.\n\u201cBullseye, Master Wodilic!\u201d Dob crowed."}

As the subject of my annual children's sermon, I have chosen \"The Martyrdom of &lt;a href=\"Saint%20Pelin\"&gt;Saint Pelin&lt;/a&gt;.\" Now I know you have probably heard this story already, but in this time of trouble I think it is good to revisit the tales of our ancestors so we may draw strength and lessons from them.\nNow Saint Pelin lived back in the early part of the &lt;a href=\"First%20Era\"&gt;First Era&lt;/a&gt;, when the world was stranger than today. At that time &lt;a href=\"Tamriel\"&gt;Tamriel&lt;/a&gt; was largely untamed and our ancestors had to be strong and brave, for the woods and hills were home to things like &lt;a href=\"Minotaur%20%28Online%29\"&gt;bull-men&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"centaur\"&gt;centaur&lt;/a&gt;s, and fire serpents.\nSaint Pelin wasn't a saint at first, of course: he was a humble man, a beadle at the Chapel of &lt;a href=\"Stendarr\"&gt;Stendarr&lt;/a&gt; at the &lt;a href=\"Bangkorai%20Garrison\"&gt;Bangkorai Garrison&lt;/a&gt;, where he tended to the spiritual needs of the soldiers guarding the walls. He had other tasks as well, such as bringing the sentries water when the sun was high. One day as he carried around his bucket dipper he noticed there were more guards than usual. He stopped at the main gate and asked his friend, &lt;a href=\"Sergeant%20Clancie\"&gt;Sergeant Clancie&lt;/a&gt;, why that was. \"It is because the &lt;a href=\"Gray%20Host\"&gt;Gray Host&lt;/a&gt; is coming,\" said Clancie, \"which is a terrible army of &lt;a href=\"Vampire%20%28Online%29\"&gt;vampires&lt;/a&gt; from &lt;a href=\"Verkarth\"&gt;Verkarth&lt;/a&gt;, and I'm more than a little worried about it.\"\n\"Oh, my!\" said Pelin. \"Is there anything I can do to help you and the other soldiers?\"\n\"Pray for us, Pelin,\" said Clancie. \"For a great trial is upon us.\"\nSergeant Clancie's words made Pelin anxious, so when he was done with his chores he climbed a tall tower and looked south. And there he saw the Gray Host coming out of the desert, a whole army of &lt;a href=\"Werebat\"&gt;bat-men&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Wolf%20%28Online%29\"&gt;wolves&lt;/a&gt;, and even worse things!\nSo Pelin went back to the chapel to pray, and as he heard the sounds of battle, he prayed to Stendarr, to &lt;a href=\"Akatosh\"&gt;Akatosh&lt;/a&gt;, to &lt;a href=\"Julianos\"&gt;Julianos&lt;/a&gt;, to &lt;a href=\"Kynareth\"&gt;Kynareth&lt;/a&gt;, and to all their saints for help.\nBut then folk began to come into the chapel, setting up cots and tables and bringing in wounded soldiers for aid and surgery. \"Come and help us, Beadle,\" called the Doctor. \"It's your strong arms we need now, not your prayers.\"\nSo Pelin came and looked at the wounded soldiers, and found them wondrous pale. \"What has happened to them, Doctor?\" he asked. \"These soldiers are as white as the sheets on my bed.\"\n\"It is the bat-men, Beadle,\" the Doctor said. \"When they bite our soldiers, they drain the blood from them in great draughts, leaving them pale and empty.\"\n\"Horror!\" cried Pelin. \"You're right, Doctor, this is time for more than prayers. For Stendarr says, 'He who fights hardest prays loudest.' I know nothing of fighting or of doctoring, but I will go to the battle and trust Stendarr to show me what to do.\"\nSo Pelin ran to the fighting at the top of the great gate, where he found his friend, Sergeant Clancie, fighting a bat-man. The vampire beat at the sergeant with its wings and tried to grip him so as to bite, but Pelin grasped the bat-man by the legs so Clancie was able to kill it with his sword.\n\"This is no place for you!\" the sergeant cried. \"The bat-men are at the gate, and soon they will burst it open and take the garrison!\"\nPelin looked down and saw that what the sergeant said was true: a great press of bat-men was ramming against the gates, and the doors were bulging inward. Pelin cried, \"Is there nothing we can do?\"\n\"The stone wall here has been loosened by flying stones,\" said the sergeant. \"I had hoped to gather enough soldiers to push it down upon the bat-men\u2014see, reinforcements are coming!\u2014but the Gray Host will be through the gates before they can get here.\"\n\"Then I must delay them,\" said Pelin. And he flung himself from the battlements and upon the horde of vampires.\nThe wings of the bat-men broke Pelin's fall, and he landed among them hale and alive. \"Vampires!\" cried Pelin. \"Push not upon the gate, for what you want is here: a strong, healthy body full of fresh, warm blood. Take! Drink!\"\nAnd the Gray Host turned as one and fell upon Pelin, fastening upon his veins. Then Pelin felt himself collapsing like a wine-sack at the harvest-festival, and knew that before the sergeant could gather enough soldiers he would be drained dry. So he prayed a mighty prayer, saying, \"O Stendarr, God of Justice, fill me with an ocean of blood that I might beguile these daemons away from the gate but a few minutes more!\"\nAnd then Pelin felt himself filled anew with blood, flowing from him in a very fountain, and the divine geyser of gore drew every bat-man within sight into a great feeding mound before the gate.\nMeanwhile Sergeant Clancie and his friends pushed against the wall above, until all of a sudden the great stones went crashing down. The bat-men were nearly all slain, and by the time the ones who weren't had gathered their wits, they saw that the pursuing legions of &lt;a href=\"Empress%20Hestra\"&gt;Empress Hestra&lt;/a&gt; were almost upon them. And that was the end of the Gray Host.\nSo that is how a beadle from Bangkorai Garrison became a saint. Now I ask you, children\u2014 does not our time resemble that of Saint Pelin? Is there not once again an army at our gates? Yes, indeed. And that's why our leaders ask each and every one of us to do as much as we can to help defend our homeland. Some of us may even have to give our lives.\nSo when the time comes, tell yourself that you, too, have the strength to do what's needed. For I think, if we have to, we can all be as strong as a humble man like Pelin. Don't you?"}

Our maps were inadequate, as were our plans and preparations. Nearly starved, frostbitten, and lost, it was only by sheer luck that we even stumbled onto the entrance, which sat half-buried and covered in a layer of ice high in the peaks.\nBy the time we cracked open the door, locked by a combination of mechanical and arcane mechanisms, our supplies had dwindled dangerously low. But it was worth it. As the barrier separated and we saw into the gloom, it was clear that the rumor was true: this place was long undisturbed, unmarred by robbers and scavengers. Who knew what we would find inside?\nWe could never have guessed at the answer. The entry hall itself was very unusual. It featured a gleaming metal staircase, ornately molded and engraved with strange glyphs and angular emblems. As soon as my boot touched the first step, a clear tone rang out into the cold, startling us all. Every footfall created a new, sweet sound as we descended to the bottom, eager to escape the chill and reinvigorated by the prospect of discovery.\nFifty men could have stretched head to toe across the circular chamber that opened before us at the base of the stair. Its high dome receded into shadow, and ringed all around the center of the floor were thirteen massive statues, posed with arms extended to the side and legs shoulder-width apart. Each was clad in a unique suit of armor. Every suit was crafted from a different material, some of which were recognizable (steel, ebony, and iron among them), but several could not be identified at first look.\nMany of the suits boasted strange, angular plates of metal or precious stone affixed to the joints or helms, and some featured engraved patterns and phrases. The construction of the place imparted a sense of reverence; the careful placements and grand scale made the chamber feel almost holy. We crept among the statues, marveling at the armor and wishing we had more knowledge of &lt;a href=\"Blacksmithing\"&gt;smithing&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Metalworking\"&gt;metalwork&lt;/a&gt;.\nIn the center of them all stood a bronze monolith, thirteen-sided and engraved from top to bottom with characters and diagrams that seemed related to the armors worn by the statues. We approached the monument, but, lost in our wonder at the mysteries before us, we forgot we were intruders, neglected the caution necessary in such places. I reached out a hand to touch the metal, and as soon as my skin made contact, chaos erupted.\nI remember little but the screams of my companions, bright flashes of light, and a mad dash to the staircase, which produced a cacophony as I scrambled up it and out onto the snow. I realized then that I was alone. Injured and heartbroken at the loss of my expeditionary allies, I made it to a small village only by the grace of the Divines. I was never able to locate the entrance again, but its secrets still wait, hidden in the snow."}

Viranus, though ostensibly a member of the Fighter's Guild, has been - according to Oreyn - \"held back\" by an overprotective &lt;a href=\"Vilena%20Donton\"&gt;mother&lt;/a&gt;, possibly due to the fact that Viranus's &lt;a href=\"Vitellus%20Donton\"&gt;brother&lt;/a&gt; was killed in a Fighter's Guild raid. Modryn Oreyn asks the Hero to raise Viranus's confidence by leading him on a triumphant dungeon crawl in &lt;a href=\"Nonwyll%20Cavern\"&gt;Nonwyll Cavern&lt;/a&gt;, located northwest of &lt;a href=\"Chorrol%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;Chorrol&lt;/a&gt;. The expedition also involves discovering the fate of Galtus Previa, who has gone missing.\nUpon receiving the quest follow the quest marker to the Donton household. Despite Oreyn's imprecations to the contrary, speaking to the Guildmaster carries no perceivable quest penalty. Get Viranus Donton to follow and head to Nonwyll Cavern.\nThe cavern is populated by &lt;a href=\"Rat%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;rats&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Troll%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;trolls&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Ogre%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;ogres&lt;/a&gt; and a &lt;a href=\"Minotaur%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;minotaur&lt;/a&gt;. However, as Viranus is an essential character, there is no need to care about his continued survival, however he can't heal himself so after a few dead trolls he tends to get knocked unconscious often unless waiting for an hour for him to heal.\nEventually, the body of Galtus Previa can be found lying on the floor. A suspicious-looking &lt;a href=\"Broken%20Shield\"&gt;Broken Shield&lt;/a&gt; lies next to him. Upon discovery of this gruesome scene return to Oreyn to find him grudgingly impressed, a welcome change from his previous demeanor.\nHe will offer an enchanted blade. Note that it doesn't seem to matter whether or not the Broken Shield is brought back, though he has a dialogue option that recognizes the shield if it's in the inventory.\nAlternative Walkthrough.\nUnlike the &lt;a href=\"Desolate%20Mine\"&gt;Desolate Mine&lt;/a&gt; from a &lt;a href=\"The%20Desolate%20Mine\"&gt;previous quest&lt;/a&gt;, the cave is not locked and doesn't require Donton to enter. After obtaining the quest from Oreyn, the Hero can travel to the cave alone and simply clear both zones at their own speed without Donton charging about. Then, go back to Chorrol to pick up Donton. Take him to the cave's back entrance which is near the 'o' in County Chorrol on the provincial map, lead him to Previa's body, get the quest update and return to Oreyn."}

Our maps were inadequate, as were our plans and preparations. Nearly starved, frostbitten, and lost, it was only by sheer luck that we even stumbled onto the entrance, which sat half-buried and covered in a layer of ice high in the peaks.\nBy the time we cracked open the door, locked by a combination of mechanical and arcane mechanisms, our supplies had dwindled dangerously low. But it was worth it. As the barrier separated and we saw into the gloom, it was clear that the rumor was true: this place was long undisturbed, unmarred by robbers and scavengers. Who knew what we would find inside?\nWe could never have guessed at the answer. The entry hall itself was very unusual. It featured a gleaming metal staircase, ornately molded and engraved with strange glyphs and angular emblems. As soon as my boot touched the first step, a clear tone rang out into the cold, startling us all. Every footfall created a new, sweet sound as we descended to the bottom, eager to escape the chill and reinvigorated by the prospect of discovery.\nFifty men could have stretched head to toe across the circular chamber that opened before us at the base of the stair. Its high dome receded into shadow, and ringed all around the center of the floor were thirteen massive statues, posed with arms extended to the side and legs shoulder-width apart. Each was clad in a unique suit of &lt;a href=\"Armor%20%28Online%29\"&gt;armor&lt;/a&gt;. Every suit was crafted from a different material, some of which were recognizable (&lt;a href=\"Steel%20Ingot%20%28Online%29\"&gt;steel&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Ebony%20Ingot%20%28Online%29\"&gt;ebony&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Iron%20Ingot%20%28Online%29\"&gt;iron&lt;/a&gt; among them), but several could not be identified at first look.\nMany of the suits boasted strange, angular plates of metal or precious stone affixed to the joints or helms, and some featured engraved patterns and phrases. The construction of the place imparted a sense of reverence; the careful placements and grand scale made the chamber feel almost holy. We crept among the statues, marveling at the armor and wishing we had more knowledge of &lt;a href=\"Blacksmithing\"&gt;smithing&lt;/a&gt; and metalwork.\nIn the center of them all stood a bronze monolith, thirteen-sided and engraved from top to bottom with characters and diagrams that seemed related to the armors worn by the statues. We approached the monument, but, lost in our wonder at the mysteries before us, we forgot we were intruders, neglected the caution necessary in such places. I reached out a hand to touch the metal, and as soon as my skin made contact, chaos erupted.\nI remember little but the screams of my companions, bright flashes of light, and a mad dash to the staircase, which produced a cacophony as I scrambled up it and out onto the snow. I realized then that I was alone. Injured and heartbroken at the loss of my expeditionary allies, I made it to a small village only by the grace of &lt;a href=\"the%20Divines\"&gt;the Divines&lt;/a&gt;. I was never able to locate the entrance again, but its secrets still wait, hidden in the snow."}

It was once following a &lt;a href=\"Thalmor\"&gt;Thalmor&lt;/a&gt; supported &lt;a href=\"Void%20Nights\"&gt;coup d'\u00e9tat&lt;/a&gt;. Anequina now exists as a client state of the &lt;a href=\"Third%20Aldmeri%20Dominion\"&gt;Third Aldmeri Dominion&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe northern regions of Elsweyr are dominated by badlands and desert, a climate of which has influenced the culture of the Anequina Khajiit massively. The 'kingdom' is little more than a collection of chiefdoms in loose cooperation, but all with a common goal of preserving said culture and protecting their lands.\nHistory.\nFourth Era.\nAfter the &lt;a href=\"Oblivion%20Crisis\"&gt;Oblivion Crisis&lt;/a&gt;, the province of Elsweyr was damaged as a result of the &lt;a href=\"Daedra\"&gt;Daedra&lt;/a&gt; attacks but still part of the &lt;a href=\"Mede%20Empire\"&gt;Empire&lt;/a&gt;. But once the two moons, &lt;a href=\"Masser\"&gt;Masser&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Secunda\"&gt;Secunda&lt;/a&gt;, disappeared during the &lt;a href=\"Void%20Nights\"&gt;Void Nights&lt;/a&gt;, the province was thrown into chaos, as a large part of &lt;a href=\"Khajiit\"&gt;Khajiit&lt;/a&gt;i culture revolves around the interpretation of the lunar cycle. The &lt;a href=\"Thalmor%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Thalmor&lt;/a&gt; took advantage of the return of the moons to claim that they were responsible for bringing the moons back (or they may have actually brought the moons back using Dawn Magicks), and were able to gain a large amount of influence over Elsweyr. This led to Elsweyr splitting away from the Empire and forming the two states of Pelletine and Anequina once again.\nNotable Locations.\nDune.\nThe City of Dune is located in Western Anequina. In the Border Region of Reaper's March. The City is divided with one District that includes a Fighter's Guild, Mages Guild, and a Tavern. Another District where many of the Markets are located. And one with the Two Moons Path Temple.\nFort Sphinxmoth.\nThe Imperial Fort Sphinxmoth is located on the Edge of Anequina in the Border Region of Reaper's March. Over time and time again, the Fort switches occupants every so often. The Fort is separated from the Ruins of the Fort to the New Fort which leads to Cyrodiil.\nOrcrest.\nThe City of Orcrest is located in Central Anequina and is adjacent to Corinthe.\nRiverhold.\nThe City of Riverhold is located on the Border of Elsweyr and Cyrodiil near Skingrad.\nRimmen.\nThe City of Rimmen is located near Leyawiin on the Borders of Elsweyr and Cyrodiil.\nSources.\nThe following books mention Anequina:"}

You want to live in warm climate too, like Hrodkir, so you come to &lt;a href=\"Elsweyr%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Elsweyr&lt;/a&gt;? Good choice. There is no snow here. This one was trapper in &lt;a href=\"Winterhold%20%28City%29\"&gt;Winterhold&lt;/a&gt; long ago, but he has lived in &lt;a href=\"Anequina\"&gt;Anequina&lt;/a&gt; many years now, learning the language and teaching savannah cats how to catch prey without pouncing. Hrodkir cannot draw, so he will just tell you what to catch. He wishes you luck.\n&lt;a href=\"Jerboa\"&gt;Jerboa&lt;/a&gt;\nThere are many mice in Elsweyr. Hrodkir thinks this is why there are also many cats. Mice and rats aren't usually good eating, Except maybe &lt;a href=\"Skeever%20%28Online%29\"&gt;skeevers&lt;/a&gt;, but in Anequina there are bunny-mice called Jerboa that make good meatballs. Truthfully, Hrodkir does not know if they are more bunny or mouse. Have long ears and legs, but also long tails. This one thinks you will know them when you see them. You will see lots of them. They breed quickly. Take two or three daily for meals and they won't even notice. String noose laid over mouth of their den is sure to catch one by nightfall. Hrodkir thinks they taste a little sweet. Must be the &lt;a href=\"Moon%20Sugar\"&gt;moon-sugar&lt;/a&gt; they get into.\n&lt;a href=\"Fennec%20Fox\"&gt;Fennec Fox&lt;/a&gt;es\nThere are also many large-eared foxes that Hrodkir thinks look like cats, but they are not cats, so you can eat them without getting in trouble. This one thought huge ears were silly, but they work. These foxes are very hard to hunt, but Hrodkir has great method for catching. Gather some scorpions for foxes to eat. They like scorpions. Cut off stingers. Mince garlic and onions. Rub paste on scorpions, good and thick. Paste is poison to foxes. Kills and seasons them at the same time! Foxes remind Hrodkir of wolf, but more tender and less gamey.\n&lt;a href=\"Fellrunner\"&gt;Fellrunner&lt;/a&gt;\nBig birds. Not horse big. Goat to deer big. They have long legs and necks, but tiny wings. These birds don't fly or swim. They run. Fast. But very stupid. Hrodkir herds them into trip wires with loud shouting. At full speed they fall and break things. Fragile bones. Fellrunners make good, lean jerky, but are tricky to cook without getting dry. Keep bacon grease for basting.\n&lt;a href=\"Terror%20Bird\"&gt;Terror Bird&lt;/a&gt;s\nBigger birds. Kind of vulture-lizard. They don't fly, but run, leap, and claw. Very strong. Hrodkir has seen one trample a lion. Very smart, too. Hard to trap and dangerous to hunt. This one found one dead and tried meat. Tough, stringy, greasy, and tastes like used boots. Best avoided. Not worth trouble.\n&lt;a href=\"Thorn%20Gecko\"&gt;Thorn Gecko&lt;/a&gt;\nLike other geckos but has thorns. Good name, yes? They hunt bugs during day and move quick, but at night they look for warmth and are sluggish. Look for dark stone. You find some resting. Grab them with little trouble. Watch thorns, though. Also taste like other geckos. If you like gecko meat, you will like thorn gecko meat.\n&lt;a href=\"Daggerback\"&gt;Daggerback&lt;/a&gt;\nBristly boar found lots of places. Tusks and quills all around head. Dig a hole. Place blanket over it. Weigh down with rocks. Scatter sand and mushrooms on top of blanket. If hole deep enough, you eat well for weeks. Strong taste. Best in stew.\n&lt;a href=\"Alit%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Desert Alit&lt;/a&gt;\nMouth with legs. Hrodkir has seen them all over &lt;a href=\"Tamriel\"&gt;Tamriel&lt;/a&gt;. This one thinks desert ones are meanest. Big mouth to feed and not much to eat. Nets traps work best. Once entangled, they can't escape. Skin is tough, but meat is good, if chewy.\n&lt;a href=\"Sep%20Adder\"&gt;Sep Adder&lt;/a&gt;\nHrodkir had not seen these before coming to Elsweyr. He was told they are also found in &lt;a href=\"Hammerfell%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Hammerfell&lt;/a&gt;. Large desert snakes, usually brown scaled, with wings on their backs. They don't fly much. Mostly use wings to scare predators and shade head. They can pounce from great distance, though. Normally wouldn't try to net snake, but wings are easily trapped. Easy to skin and cook. Like scaly, scary hens.\n&lt;a href=\"Lion%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Lions&lt;/a&gt;\nNot all cats in Elsweyr are &lt;a href=\"Khajiit%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Khajiit&lt;/a&gt;, but more cats are Khajiit than you might expect. This one can't usually tell unless the cat is clothed. Hrodkir suggests not eating cats while in Elsweyr. Khajiit think it in poor taste. Meat is actually tasty, though."}

At some point, she met the mythic-hero, &lt;a href=\"Khunzar-ri\"&gt;Khunzar-ri&lt;/a&gt;, and became his lover and one of his traveling companions. She was present during the conflict with the Dragon-Lord, &lt;a href=\"Kaalgrontiid\"&gt;Kaalgrontiid&lt;/a&gt;. Khunzari-ri gathered his companions, known as the Kra'Jun, to fight against the threat of the dragons and fought Kaalgrontiid and his band of warriors for forty-one days and nights, all across ancient &lt;a href=\"Elsweyr\"&gt;Elsweyr&lt;/a&gt;.\nOne of the Kra'Jun, &lt;a href=\"Cadwell\"&gt;Cadwell&lt;/a&gt;, suggested the use of trickery to defeat the dragons by pretending to give them the moons' energy while in fact having the moons absorb their energy. Anequina worked with the priesthood of Shadow Dance Temple, using the Dance of Shadows to maneuver the moons into alignment and siphon the invaders' essence.\nOnce the dragons were weakened, Khunzar-ri sealed the dragons in the &lt;a href=\"Halls%20of%20Colossus\"&gt;Halls of Colossus&lt;/a&gt;, where they remained for several millennia. However, Cadwell killed Khunzar-ri in order to harness the stolen energy and attain godhood himself. Anequina and the remaining companions managed to put a stop to Cadwell's ambitions.\nAnequina continued her service as the Queen of her pride, spearheading their campaign in the First War of the Prides. They were considered the strongest in the conflict, and to pay homage to her, they took up her name, Ne Quin-al. &lt;a href=\"Khamira%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Queen Khamira&lt;/a&gt;, who was active during the &lt;a href=\"Interregnum\"&gt;Interregnum&lt;/a&gt;, was a descendant of Anequina."}

An informative journal of &lt;a href=\"Medresi%20Dran\"&gt;Medresi Dran&lt;/a&gt; is on the table with the lantern, as well as a &lt;a href=\"Skill%20Books%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;skill book&lt;/a&gt; for &lt;a href=\"Speech\"&gt;Speech&lt;/a&gt;, \"&lt;a href=\"A%20Dance%20in%20Fire%2C%20Book%20VII\"&gt;A Dance in Fire, Book VII&lt;/a&gt;\".\nUpon entering the ruins, there will be a narrow passage leading southwest. A short walk later, Medresi Dran is encountered, who will ask for help. Agreeing to help will start the &lt;a href=\"Miscellaneous%20Quests%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;miscellaneous quest&lt;/a&gt; \"Destroy the Draugr in Angarvunde\".\nWooden ramps lead down to a passageway to the southeast. The path turns right (southwest) and leads to a doorway to a small room containing many urns, most of which are broken. A path continues southwest, leading through a doorway to a larger inner chamber defended by three leveled draugr. After killing these enemies, further progress is blocked by several gates and two locked doors.\nReturning to Medresi Dran, she will share the needed key, or it can be pickpocketed off of her if not wanting to help her. Now it is possible to go one of two ways: the southeastern door leads to the Angarvunde Catacombs, while the northwestern door leads to the Angarvunde Ruins.\nWhen Medresi Dran runs to get the treasure, she runs onto a round platform that raises up and kills her with spikes hanging from the ceiling. Inside the round platform, a long spiral staircase leads down to a hallway. The &lt;a href=\"Shout\"&gt;word of power&lt;/a&gt; for &lt;a href=\"Animal%20Allegiance\"&gt;Animal Allegiance&lt;/a&gt; and a chest are at the far end of the hall. Alternatively, killing Medresi Dran will open the staircase.\nSublocations.\nAngarvunde Ruins.\nAngarvunde Ruins begins in a hallway. After coming down a few flights of stairs there will be a pressure plate trap that, when activated, swings blades. Avoid it and enter a room that has a draugr. There are two closed spear gates (on the northeast and southwest sides of the room) and an iron door (also to the northeast) that has two burial urns behind it. There is a table with the &lt;a href=\"Illusion%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Illusion&lt;/a&gt; skill book: \"&lt;a href=\"Before%20the%20Ages%20of%20Man\"&gt;Before the Ages of Man&lt;/a&gt;\". There is also an easily missed novice-locked chest behind the table. Through the open doorway to the northwest is a large, multi-level room protected by two draugrs. Across the broken bridge on the upper level is a stand with a pressure plate on it. Removing the item makes spears come out of the wall.\nThrough the doorway to the southwest is a hallway patrolled by a draugr. The hallway eventually leads to a set of steps up to the northeast, which led to the first small room behind the spear gate. Flipping the lever on the column between the two gates lowers the spears and allows access to a novice-locked chest. Through the other opened gate, the spear gate to the northeast is now open. Down two flights of stairs is another Draugr patrolling a hallway that leads northwest, with a pressure plate on the floor that drops a battering ram trap. This trap can be used to kill draugr instantly, but it is recommended to be careful, since the trap activates even with the &lt;a href=\"Sneak%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Light Foot&lt;/a&gt; perk.\nAfter taking care of it, there is another one also patrolling past a right-hand jog in the hallway. Beyond that, the path turns right (northeast) and leads to a large room with two more draugr who appear from their coffins and another one on top on a catwalk. After taking care of these enemies there is a chest to the right of the door through which the room was entered, and a few potions that can be looted on the table by the coffins. Up the log ramp against the northeast wall is a catwalk to the left. Across the catwalk, up the stairs, across another catwalk (to the southeast) and down more stairs is a hallway patrolled by one more draugr. On the right (southwest) side is an alcove with gold on a table. Up the stairs to the right is the door back into Angarvunde.\nAngarvunde Catacombs.\nUpon entering the door to the catacombs, there are stairs leading down to southeast. At the bottom is a hallway that leads to rough passages to the southeast, then turning right (southwest). A spiral set of steps leads down, but does not reach all the way to the floor. After taking the final step off the stairs, a draugr will enter the room. A hallway leads down stairs to the northwest, then turns right (northeast). Halfway down the hallway on the left is a staircase that leads up to a chest that is trapped. The main hallway turns left (northwest), where another draugr awaits. Continuing on, the hallway turns right, then leads to a room with a draugr resting in its hole. The path continues down stairs to the left (northwest), where another draugr awaits. At the bottom of the stairs are more resting draugr and a novice-locked chest.\nThe path turns right (northeast) to a large room with another draugr. The next room holds another enemy and another chest hidden on the other side of the pillar. Through the door to the northwest is a small room, and then stairs lead up to the right (northeast). However, hidden under some roots halfway up the stairs is a pressure plate which shoots arrows up from the floor on the staircase. There will be another staircase to the right (southeast) and another pressure plate exactly like the first one, as well as an enemy at the top in the doorway.\nBeyond that is a vegetated area with two more draugr. There are several more stairs to climb, with sleeping draugr in the room at the top of each one. After defeating the rest of the sleeping enemies, there will be the final set of stairs, which leads to a door heading back into Angarvunde. Just before the door, on the left, is a table with the book \"&lt;a href=\"Wraith%27s%20Wedding%20Dowry\"&gt;Wraith's Wedding Dowry&lt;/a&gt;\".\nQuests.\n&lt;a href=\"Medresi%20Dran%20and%20the%20Wandering%20Dead\"&gt;Medresi Dran and the Wandering Dead&lt;/a&gt;.\n&lt;a href=\"Medresi%20Dran\"&gt;Medresi Dran&lt;/a&gt; will speak to the &lt;a href=\"Last%20Dragonborn\"&gt;Dragonborn&lt;/a&gt; when approached.

To collect the shard-key of the Cunning, disarm each guardian and fight the &lt;a href=\"Untombed%20Trickster\"&gt;Untombed Trickster&lt;/a&gt; skeletons rising from the ground. Then open the chest standing in the middle to get the shard of the Cunning.\nThe final shard is guarded by a spirit, &lt;a href=\"Sir%20Thomas%20Kinlin\"&gt;Sir Thomas Kinlin&lt;/a&gt;, who tried to kill Angof. Follow the marker to find him and talk to him. He will give up the shard-key if the Vestige will help him to be released from Angof's hold. He gives a riddle and says to look in the next room. Kill the cultists and loot the release stone from him. Go back to Sir Thomas and release him by giving the correct answer (\"Release from slumber! Eternal darkness, come forth!\") to him. Then he'll hand over the shard-key of the Lost.\nHead over to the door leading to Angof's sanctum and enter. With the help of both Gabrielle and Sir Lanis, it's now time to face Angof.\nAngof attacks with a basic &lt;a href=\"shaman\"&gt;shaman&lt;/a&gt; ranged attack that deals moderate damage. Lanis and Gautier will spend the battle fighting zombies on either side of the room. Gabrielle can draw aggro from him (until low on health) as well as heal the Vestige, making the battle easier. She will also call out his special attack and create areas of protective life, which the Vestige should take cover in.\nAfter defeating him a portal to the &lt;a href=\"Lion%20Guard%20Redoubt\"&gt;Lion Guard Redoubt&lt;/a&gt; opens and Gabrielle urges the Vestige to go through. Walk over to Gabrielle and talk to her. She thinks it was fun, well maybe fun isn't the word for it but she thinks the Vestige was glorious! Angof is finally dead and they can't thank them enough for what they've done. The others are exhausted but she says Sir Lanis wants a word before they leave.\nGo over to Sir Lanis and he tells the Vestige the king will be grateful for what they've done here. Some of Angof's minions are still running loose, but it's nothing they can't handle. Without Angof's magic the vines will wither and die, maybe the &lt;a href=\"Mages%20Guild%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Mages Guild&lt;/a&gt; can conjure up a spell to clear them away. But there is still something that is worrying him, but he can't put his finger on what. There's trouble in &lt;a href=\"Koeglin%20Village\"&gt;Koeglin Village&lt;/a&gt;, something bad is happening there. Then he hands over the reward to the Vestige."}

Their aesthetic designs differ from &lt;a href=\"province\"&gt;province&lt;/a&gt; to province.\nWhen defeated, many animunculi are found to contain &lt;a href=\"Soul%20Gem%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;soul gems&lt;/a&gt; of various sizes, &lt;a href=\"Dwarven%20Oil%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Dwarven oil&lt;/a&gt;, and various &lt;a href=\"Dwemer%20artifact\"&gt;artifacts&lt;/a&gt; which may be sold or smelted into &lt;a href=\"Dwarven%20metal%20ingot\"&gt;ingots&lt;/a&gt;, or simply used as decorations.\nNumidium.\nThe Numidium was a colossal golem built by the Dwemer during the &lt;a href=\"First%20Era\"&gt;First Era&lt;/a&gt;.

The &lt;a href=\"Bosmer%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Wood Elves&lt;/a&gt; initially welcomed us\u2014or, at least, our trade goods\u2014but fewer and fewer of them come into the city every week. Our import trade has declined such that &lt;a href=\"Linduure\"&gt;Linduure&lt;/a&gt; is talking about heading inland, perhaps to &lt;a href=\"Brackenleaf%20%28Town%29\"&gt;Brackenleaf&lt;/a&gt; or even &lt;a href=\"Elden%20Root%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Elden Root&lt;/a&gt; to drum up business. I don't like the idea of her going into the wilds alone, but she assures me the roads are safe and other traders and merchants have done the same.\nA ship arrived yesterday, restocking for the voyage to &lt;a href=\"Khenarthi%27s%20Roost\"&gt;Khenarthi's Roost&lt;/a&gt;. There're rumors of a larger &lt;a href=\"Aldmeri%20Dominion%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Dominion&lt;/a&gt; fleet headed to the &lt;a href=\"Khajiit%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Khajiiti&lt;/a&gt; island later on this month. I hope so. That one, small scout vessel bought up most of our supplies in one go! Linduure wants to restock the shop and see what happens. Maybe she'll stop talking about traveling alone into the interior.\nThe first few ships from the fleet arrived just this morning, and Haven is bustling with activity! General Endare's troops have been pressed into service to help the city guard maintain order. I've heard rumors of smugglers trying to find their way past the customs agents around the fort, but unless they want to brave the swamp or somehow find their way under or around the walls, they're out of luck! Our resupply came in not a moment too soon!\nThe excitement of Fleet Day has ebbed and Haven feels particularly empty again. Almost none of the Wood Elves who first came to see the \"great stone city\" have returned, and those few who remain aren't interested in our wares. Linduure and I have been arguing again about her proposed trip inland. I say we should stock up and wait for another Fleet Day\u2014the ships have to return from Khenarthi's Roost sometime\u2014but she says we can't count on that. Once the treaty is signed, she says, there won't be armadas sailing to and fro \u2026 just small traders. I'm not so certain.\nAnother windfall today! General Endare is taking her Jade Dragoons inland. The innkeeper says she's been asking around about some of the ancient &lt;a href=\"Ayleid%20Ruins%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Ayleid sites&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Grahtwood\"&gt;Grahtwood&lt;/a&gt;. I don't know why she's going herself, but her troops have been stockpiling rations all morning. We're nearly sold out again!\nNow that the soldiers are gone, the Port feels even more empty\u2014and a bit bare. We've seen sails off the coast, but just ships passing by. I can tell Linduure is itching to do something, but we've made so much profit in the last month that I can't believe she thinks the trip is worth the risk.\nTurns out my wife is more headstrong than I thought. She insists on investing our newfound wealth. She's purchased a pair of wagons, some &lt;a href=\"Guar%20%28Online%29\"&gt;guar&lt;/a&gt;, and she's even hired a Wood Elf &lt;a href=\"jaqspur\"&gt;jaqspur&lt;/a&gt; and some mercenaries as guards. It's off to Brackenleaf and Elden Root for her. I guess I shouldn't be nervous. General Endare marched her dragoons up the same road less than a week ago. Any bandits out there should be thoroughly cowed.\nLinduure's been gone two days now and things in Haven haven't picked up. I'm hoping we see some incoming sails soon - not just for the trade, but for the activity. The city gets hot in the summer, and most everyone, guards and merchants alike, gets lazy without any visitors. I found myself napping out by the well today for over an hour.\nAt last! Some commotion over at the fort. I think a ship came in early this morning. I'm going to load up the hand-cart with a few samples and head down to the pier. Perhaps the newcomers have money to spend!"}

Our Master's official protest was denied, as usual. This will make relations with the local populace more difficult, although the \"hostages\" are in fact housed and trained with the other acolytes.\n&lt;a href=\"1E%202804\"&gt;2804&lt;/a&gt;: Upon the outbreak of the &lt;a href=\"Winterhold%20Rebellion\"&gt;Winterhold Rebellion&lt;/a&gt;, our Master refused orders to send the Dragonguard out to help suppress the rebellion. The Emperor ordered our supplies cut off, but we have made arrangements with the local &lt;a href=\"Reachmen\"&gt;Reachmen&lt;/a&gt; and are effectively self-sufficient. The Grandmaster supports our Master's action on the grounds that it violates the Oath of Allegiance.\n&lt;a href=\"1E%202805\"&gt;2805&lt;/a&gt;: The Temple is besieged. The fool &lt;a href=\"Kalien\"&gt;Kalien&lt;/a&gt; was sent to &lt;a href=\"Winterhold%20%28Skyrim%20City%29\"&gt;Winterhold&lt;/a&gt; and sacked the city. There was a reason he was denied entry into the Dragonguard. But the local people do not count the difference between &lt;a href=\"Akaviri\"&gt;Akaviri&lt;/a&gt;. All our years of building up trust with people of &lt;a href=\"Skyrim\"&gt;Skyrim&lt;/a&gt; are now for naught.\n&lt;a href=\"1E%202806\"&gt;2806&lt;/a&gt;: We learned of the accession of &lt;a href=\"Reman%20II\"&gt;Reman II&lt;/a&gt; (of blessed name) when the siege of the Temple was lifted. We provided the honor guard for the Emperor's first visit to Skyrim, a great boost to the Temple's prestige.\n&lt;a href=\"1E%202809\"&gt;2809&lt;/a&gt;: We received reports of a &lt;a href=\"Dragons%20%28Lore%29\"&gt;dragon&lt;/a&gt; in the east. Scouts were sent immediately, and signs of it were discovered, but it fled at our approach. The survivors have grown wary indeed.\n&lt;a href=\"1E%202812\"&gt;2812&lt;/a&gt;: We finally received permission from the Emperor to begin construction of &lt;a href=\"Alduin%27s%20Wall\"&gt;Alduin's Wall&lt;/a&gt;. Craftsmen from Temples across the Empire have arrived and begun the great work, overseen by our own Master, as is only fitting, as she is unmatched in her dragonlore.\n&lt;a href=\"1E%202813\"&gt;2813&lt;/a&gt;: Work on Alduin's Wall progresses. The Master dismissed several craftsmen (from a western Temple that I do not need to name, they are so well known for stiff-necked pride), which has delayed the work, but there must be no compromise. Alduin's Wall is our gift to those that come after us.\n&lt;a href=\"1E%202815\"&gt;2815&lt;/a&gt;: The Grandmaster visited the Temple in the summer to view the progress of the Wall. He has received complaints about the expense (there is no doubt where these originate), but he was so impressed by the Wall even in its half-finished state that he gave our Master a Writ of Requisition under the Emperor's seal. There will be no more delays!\nFurther reports of dragons in the east which could not be verified.\n&lt;a href=\"1E%202818\"&gt;2818&lt;/a&gt;: An auspicious year. Alduin's Wall was finished, a dragon was located and slain, and Emperor Reman II visited to officially dedicate the Wall. The Blood Seal was consecrated in the presence of all the Dragonguard of Skyrim, a great honor with which few Temples can boast."}

They made it to the roof, but there was a fifty-foot fall. Anna\u00efg provided Glim a flying potion. Glim didn't trust in her, the last time she gave him a potion crafted by her it made his skin translucent. He finally decided to give it a try. The potion worked fairly well, and they landed in the ground. They ran as fast as they could to Anna\u00efg's home and celebrated their adventure with a bottle of wine.\nThey talked about visiting other places such as the &lt;a href=\"Imperial%20City\"&gt;Imperial City&lt;/a&gt;, but Glim didn't want to leave Lilmoth. Glim told her friend about a flying city that was approaching Lilmoth through the sea. Anna\u00efg was excited about the flying city.\nThey woke up wake up with a hangover. Anna\u00efg inquired Glim about the flying city. &lt;a href=\"Taig%20Ho%C3%AFnart\"&gt;Taig Ho\u00efnart&lt;/a&gt; joined the conversation. He told them that everything had started when &lt;a href=\"Urvwen\"&gt;Urvwen&lt;/a&gt;, a crazy old &lt;a href=\"Psijic\"&gt;Psijic&lt;/a&gt; priest, said he felt something out in the deep water. After the conversation, Anna\u00efg sent Glim to discover what Urvwen had to say, while she improved her flying potion. Anna\u00efg visited &lt;a href=\"Hecua\"&gt;Hecua&lt;/a&gt;'s store. She knew she was missing some ingredient, but she didn't know exactly which. She found a fat bottle, and her instinct told her that it was what she was looking for. Hecua told her that she had acquired it from a man who came back from an &lt;a href=\"Oblivion%20Gate\"&gt;Oblivion Gate&lt;/a&gt; after the &lt;a href=\"Oblivion%20Crisis\"&gt;Oblivion Crisis&lt;/a&gt;.\nAnna\u00efg returned home in order to discover the virtues of the ingredient. She worked in her alchemical laboratory until she crafted a new flying potion. Just when she was about to try it,\nhis father arrived home. Anna\u00efg was worried about Glim, so she sent &lt;a href=\"Coo\"&gt;Coo&lt;/a&gt; to warn him. Taig was drunk, he had sold their house to buy her a passage in a ship that would take her to the &lt;a href=\"Imperial%20City\"&gt;Imperial City&lt;/a&gt;. The flying city would arrive today at Lilmoth, and Taig feared that the city would be destroyed. Taig ordered some men to take Anna\u00efg to the ship. Anna\u00efg refused to go, but she couldn't do anything.\nAnna\u00efg was locked up in a cabin of the \"&lt;a href=\"Tsonashap\"&gt;Tsonashap&lt;/a&gt;\". Coo finally found Glim, and Anna\u00efg could tell him what had happened. Glim swam until he reached the the boat where Anna\u00efg was being transported. He secretly saved her, and he towed her up to the shore. They talked about the possibility of returning to Lilmoth, but if Taig and Urvwen were right, there was nothing to do. Anna\u00efg thought that they could reach the flying city from a hill if they used her flying potion. They drank the potion and ended up in the flying city.\nOnce in the city, they saw how the &lt;a href=\"Hist\"&gt;Hist&lt;/a&gt; controlled the Lukiul, the assimilated Argonians, not to run away from the destruction and just stand there. The &lt;a href=\"An-Xileel\"&gt;An-Xileel&lt;/a&gt; had gone away, and they would be back when everything was over. The dead bodies came back to life as undead. Anna\u00efg sent Coo to find &lt;a href=\"Prince%20Attrebus\"&gt;Prince Attrebus&lt;/a&gt; and warn him about the incoming danger. They wandered through the city until they heard some people talking in a merish dialect. Anna\u00efg, who had studied Ehlnofex, understood that they had seen them arrive to the city, and they were searching for them. They came across a man called &lt;a href=\"Wemreddle\"&gt;Wemreddle&lt;/a&gt;. He realised that they were the intruders who were being searched. However, he told them that he wasn't going to blow the whistle. He hated his life in the flying city, and he hoped that they could help him escape.\nWemreddle betrayed them, and he warned the chefs about them. The chefs saw an opportunity to progress as cooks by using the knowledge of the newcomers. They fought among them for Anna\u00efg and Glim. Finally, a chef called &lt;a href=\"Qijne\"&gt;Qijne&lt;/a&gt; won and demanded them to come with her.\nQijne ordered them to learn about the ingredients they used in her kitchen. Anna\u00efg lied her telling that Glim knew as much about cooking and ingredients as she knew, so that they remained together. Qijne ordered &lt;a href=\"Slyr\"&gt;Slyr&lt;/a&gt;, one of her cooks, to instruct Anna\u00efg and teach her how things worked around in the kitchen. Anna\u00efg was granted a hob to aid her, she naimed it &lt;a href=\"Luc\"&gt;Luc&lt;/a&gt; after her cousin.\nAnna\u00efg spent half her time cooking and the other half cataloging the ingredients they brought from Tamriel. One day, Qijne informed her that Slyr and her would be preparing a meal for &lt;a href=\"Lord%20Ghol\"&gt;Lord Ghol&lt;/a&gt;. Anna\u00efg made her best to impress the lord, but she only bored him. Slyr feared that Qijne would kill them if they failed again. That night Coo found Attrebus and Anna\u00efg could explain him what was happening in &lt;a href=\"Black%20Marsh\"&gt;Black Marsh&lt;/a&gt;. Attrebus seemed to believe her.\nAnna\u00efg tried to craft the flying potion with the ingredients she had available. Lord Ghol enjoyed the next meal Anna\u00efg and Slyr prepared. Slyr guided Anna\u00efg to her hideout where they ate and celebrated their success.\nAttrebus contacted her after many days of silence. He told her that he had had some setback,\nbut he was in his way to Umbriel. Anna\u00efg's talent spread through Umbriel. &lt;a href=\"Toel\"&gt;Toel&lt;/a&gt; invaded Qijne's kitchen in order to kidnap Anna\u00efg. Qijne gathered her most trusted cooks and they entrenched in a safe room. Her attempts to protect the kitchen were futile, and Toel's men broke in the safe room. Seeing that everything was lost, Qijne tried to kill Anna\u00efg. Slyr saved her before Qijne could stab her, thrusting a knife into her neck. Toel introduced himself, and he told Anna\u00efg she would now work for him.\nAnna\u00efg and Slyr were sent to a decontamination room. &lt;a href=\"Dulg\"&gt;Dulg&lt;/a&gt;, one of Toel's workers informed Anna\u00efg that she would be meeting Toel in his chambers. Her hair was tended, and she was given a dress. Toel asked her about her life in Tamriel. As every Umbrielian, he ignored many of the words and concepts Anna\u00efg spoke about.\nToel was haunted by Anna\u00efg's talent. They met again to discuss her progress. Slyr didn't hide her envy, she felt that she was expendable. Toel informed her that &lt;a href=\"Lord%20Irrel\"&gt;Lord Irrel&lt;/a&gt; enjoyed her meal. He offered her to work directly for him, but she would have to get rid of Slyr. Anna\u00efg refused to sacrifice her friend, disappointing Toel. Finally, Toel implied that they would procreate when Anna\u00efg felt she was ready.\nAnna\u00efg received a letter from Glim through one of the skraws. He told her that he had found her, and that they could contact through the skraws. Slyr asked Anna\u00efg to taste a course she was preparing for Lord Irrel. Anna\u00efg continued cooking when she realised that she had been poisoned. She managed to prepare a stabilizer before fainting. When someone noticed that she was unconscious, Toel expelled the venom from her body. Toel offered her to get rid of Slyr again, but Anna\u00efg refused once more.\nAnna\u00efg answered back Glim telling him that she had everything ready to escape from Umbriel. They agree to meet at midnight at the dock. Anna\u00efg contacted Attrebus one more time to tell him that Glim and her would leave Umbriel that night. She had an encounter with Slyr, who thought that Anna\u00efg wanted to kill her herself. Anna\u00efg couldn't believe what she was hearing, and she asked her not to talk to her unless it was work related.\nGlim and Anna\u00efg finally met again after a long time. Anna\u00efg provided Glim a flying potion, and they left Umbriel. After they walked away from the flying island, Anna\u00efg realised that their bodies became incorporeal. They had spent too much time in Umbriel, and now they were part of it. They returned to Umbriel thinking that they would have a chance to escape someday.\nLord of Souls.\nAnna\u00efg met Glim weekly thanks to the maps the skraws had drawn for him. Glim told her about the skraws and his secret revolt. He asked Anna\u00efg to craft potions that could allow the skraws breath underwater without having to use the vapors, but Anna\u00efg couldn't do it without being noticed.\nToel invited Anna\u00efg again to his chambers. He informed her that &lt;a href=\"Lord%20Rhel\"&gt;Lord Rhel&lt;/a&gt; had organised a tasting where their kitchen would compete with &lt;a href=\"Phmer\"&gt;Phmer&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Luuniel\"&gt;Luuniel&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Ashdre\"&gt;Ashdre&lt;/a&gt;. Phmer,\nthe founder of the ninth savor, was their main competition. He tasked Anna\u00efg to discover the ninth savor for him. Anna\u00efg believed that Toel wanted her to steal it from Phmer. She told Slyr that she would give her a second chance. She informed her about her intention to steal the ninth savor. Slyr replied that she would do what she could to help. Anna\u00efg sent a letter to Glim asking him to gather detailed information concerning &lt;a href=\"Phmer\"&gt;Phmer&lt;/a&gt;'s kitchen.\nGlim told Anna\u00efg about the trees in Umbriel. They produced the proforms the Umbrielians started as. Then the ingenium gave them a soul. Anna\u00efg proposed poisoning them, that would in essence destroy Umbriel, but Glim refused to do so, since it would affect all the Umbrielians. Glim tried to convince Anna\u00efg not to attempt stealing the ninth savor from Phmer, but Anna\u00efg was decided to do it that night.\n&lt;a href=\"Dulg\"&gt;Dulg&lt;/a&gt; woke up Anna\u00efg, apparently, Toel wanted to talk to her. Phmer and her underchefs, as well as Slyr, were in Toel's balcony. Phmer accused her of stealing the ninth savor. She used an insect-like creature that could detect the ninth savor, but the creature pointed at Slyr.\nAnna\u00efg had discovered the ninth savor on her own. She borrowed her dress to Slyr, tainted with the ninth savor and a vial with the savor in the pockets.\nWhen Slyr realized what was happening, she revealed that it had been her who had warned Phmer that Anna\u00efg was going to steal the savor from her kitchen. Slyr couldn't convince anyone that she hadn't stolen the savor, so Toel allowed Phmer to take Slyr to her kitchen to be taken care of.\nWhen everybody was gone, Anna\u00efg explained to Toel how she had discovered the ninth savor. Toel tried to procreate with her, but she told him that she would do it at her own time.\nIn her next meeting with Glim, Glim demanded Anna\u00efg weapons of sabotage for the skraws. Anna\u00efg asked him to sabotage the kitchens to attract some atention. The kitchens would blame each other, and Toel's kitchen could benefit the most from this situation. The skraws damaged the water filter, so Toel gathered some of his men and Anna\u00efg and they headed to the sump.\nThey discovered a skraw with a nutrient injector. Toel started to interrogate him, but they were attacked by another skraw. He easily defeated Toel and his men. Yet, Toel used his remaining power to attack him. Just then, Anna\u00efg realised it was Glim who was attacking them, so she killed Toel. Anna\u00efg and Glim arranged to clean the place and hide Toel's body near Phmer's kitchen. Nobody knew what happened besides them.\nAfter Toel's death, &lt;a href=\"Lord%20Irrel\"&gt;Lord Irrel&lt;/a&gt; organized an emergency meeting to decide how to procede with the tasting. Anna\u00efg dared to tell him that they had chances to win. If she failed she would probably die, but if succeded Lord Irrel would promote her to chef. Anna\u00efg was put in charge of the kitchen, and she used the information the skraws provided her to prepare a meal that Lord Rhel enjoyed, but it made other lords suffer, to the delight of Lord Rhel. Lord Rhel informed her that she had won, and that she would have to prepare a meal for Lord Umbriel himself.\nAttrebus contacted Anna\u00efg to tell her about his encounter with &lt;a href=\"Vuhon\"&gt;Vuhon&lt;/a&gt;. Anna\u00efg leant that Lord Umbriel was a &lt;a href=\"Dunmer\"&gt;Dunmer&lt;/a&gt;. Anna\u00efg could try to poison him, but Attrebus told her that it would be too dangerous.\nAnna\u00efg prepared the meal for Vuhon using the ingredients they received from &lt;a href=\"Morrowind\"&gt;Morrowind&lt;/a&gt;. Lord Umbriel was surprised by the references to the cuisine of Morrowind, so he interviewed Anna\u00efg.\nHe congratulated her for her job. Before leaving, he asked her if she knew Mere-Glim, the Argonian that had started a rebellion with the skraws. Anna\u00efg answered that he was her friend,\nand that she could talk to him. Yet, Lord Umbriel demanded her to kill him.\nAnna\u00efg developed a poison to kill Glim and poured it in the sump. When Glim entered the sump,\nhis muscles started to fail and died. His body was taken to her.\nAnna\u00efg tried to contact Attrebus through Coo, but he was asleep. However, he had left Coo open, and Anna\u00efg saw that he was sleeping with &lt;a href=\"Irinja\"&gt;Irinja&lt;/a&gt;. Attrebus had never implied that he had romantic feelings for her, but she felt jealous.\n&lt;a href=\"Fhena\"&gt;Fhena&lt;/a&gt; tried to sneak into Anna\u00efg's kitchen and murder her, but she was caught by her cooks. Anna\u00efg explained her that the drug she put in the water made Glim's body grow a crystal, a matrix containing his soul, his thoughts, his memories. She recreated Glim as an Umbrielian. When the protoform grew, Glim would be reborn conserving his thoughts and feelings. If Anna\u00efg hadn't killed Glim, someone else would have, and she wouldn't have been able to help him.\nThe next time Anna\u00efg talked to Attrebus she was noticeably angry with him. Attrebus realized that he had left Coo open, and he tried to apologize. Additionally, she asked Anna\u00efg to endure a bit longer, Umbriel would soon approach the &lt;a href=\"Imperial%20City\"&gt;Imperial City&lt;/a&gt;.\nGlim was reborn as an &lt;a href=\"Umbrielian\"&gt;Umbrielian&lt;/a&gt;. Fhena and Anna\u00efg explained him what had happened. Glim didn't understand it at first, but when Anna\u00efg explained it to him he enraged and left for the Fringe Gyre. Anna\u00efg poisoned the trees of Umbriel. Glim realised what Anna\u00efg planned, so he returned to the kitchen to ask her to stop it. While they spoke, Attrebus contacted Anna\u00efg to tell her that he had arrived at Umbriel. Sul and him had tried to use &lt;a href=\"Umbra\"&gt;Umbra&lt;/a&gt; to defeat him, but it didn't work. Their only option was to poison the trees.\nAnna\u00efg asked Glim to bring Sul and Attrebus to her, but he refused to do so unless she gave him the antidote. Anna\u00efg ended up giving up, and she offered him the antidote. While Glim was away,\nLord Umbriel discovered that the source of the venom was Anna\u00efg. Lord Umbriel found Anna\u00efg, who refused to give him the antidote. Lord Umbriel could take the recipe directly from her mind, but just as he tried to damage her Attrebus and Glim appeared. Anna\u00efg told them that Vuhon's soul was in the Ingenium. Sul summoned a &lt;a href=\"Winged%20Twilight\"&gt;Winged Twilight&lt;/a&gt;, which slammed Vuhon. Fhena dragged Anna\u00efg away from the confrontation.\nAnna\u00efg and Fhena waited for Attrebus and Glim to destroy the Ingenium. When they returned, they had a sad farewell. Glim had to stay in Umbriel to guide it out of &lt;a href=\"Mundus\"&gt;Mundus&lt;/a&gt;. Anna\u00efg provided Attrebus a flying potion, and they left the flying city.\nAfter everything is over, Attrebus and Anna\u00efg talk in a forest about their feelings. Attrebus confesses that he loves her, and that he only needs a bit of patience before he can offer her his love. Anna\u00efg replies that she is not patient by nature, but she will be patient for him."}

This was the first jubilee to feature event tickets and the Impresario. The jubilee cake for this year's celebration was a bisected three-tiered blue floral &lt;a href=\"Sweetroll%20%28Online%29\"&gt;sweetroll&lt;/a&gt; adorned with the ouroboros.\n2018.\nThe 2018 Anniversary Jubilee began at 10 AM on April 4 and ended at 10 AM on April 16.

You didn't steal that {...} outta {...} any more than I did. Who do I suspect Well, there's this {...} in {...} who would be just as happy stealing gems and framing people as I would be drinking a cool ale on a hot summertide day. I don't have any evidence, but you might wanna check into {her/him}. The name of this cleric is {...}. Good luck.\nA Friend\nYou know me and I owe you any favors and even after this you owe me nothing, you ? I used to work for this {...} by a name of {...}. Now {she/he} was a crazy one, {she/he} was. trying to find a way to get rich. And always quick to blame someone else when {she/he} got caught with {her/his} hands in the cookie jar. That's how I got put away. If I was you look to see if my old had something to do with the steeling at {...}.\nA Friend\nDear {...},\nPlease forgive this intrusion. I am quite certain that your mind is on other subjects than polite chitchat, so I will come right to the point. I do not believe that you were responsible for the burglar in The Screaming Fawn, but unless you prove yourself innocent, you will be forevermore persecuted for it. There is a adventuresome woman of my acquaintance who I believe knows more about the affair than most. It may be that she even arranged or even the crime. I can say no more, except that her name is Barbabyth Greensly and she lives in Penwall Derry. And one final thing: she has very powerful friends. Do not face her at a disadvantage.\nA Friend\nDear {...},\nPerhaps it would interest you to know that there is at least one person who doesn't think you did it. Or maybe I should say two people in {...} don't think you did it. Me and the one who did it -- a {...} who did do the burglary. Now, the truth is that I don't have any proof, but {...}, that's the {...}, has done that kind of jewel-robbing before. {...}, {she/he} even spent time in jail for it. So, maybe {...} didn't do it. Maybe. But if {she/he} didn't, I can tell you this -- {she/he} knows more about who really did it than you do. So if you want to find out who did it and who's framing you, go find this {...} and ask {her/him} some questions.\nA Friend\nDear {...},\nYou have probably not heard the fairy tale of &lt;a href=\"Numidium\"&gt;Numidium&lt;/a&gt;, but you need to.\nThe legend dates back to the earliest parts of the &lt;a href=\"third%20era\"&gt;third era&lt;/a&gt;. Numidium was supposed to be a giant so big his hands could knock the moons from the sky. I do not recall from the stories whether Numidium was supposed to be good or bad, but the legends used to scare me as a child.\nThe legends are, in fact, true. There was a Numidium, and, if situations continue, he will come again. The &lt;a href=\"Totem%20of%20Tiber%20Septim\"&gt;Totem of Tiber Septim&lt;/a&gt; is used to control Numidium. However, legend has it that great Numidium lost his &lt;a href=\"Mantella\"&gt;Mantellan heart&lt;/a&gt;, whatever that is, in the final with &lt;a href=\"Tiber%20Septim\"&gt;Tiber Septim&lt;/a&gt;'s &lt;a href=\"Zurin%20Arctus\"&gt;Battlemage&lt;/a&gt;. Until his heart is found, the Totem is useless.\nA Friend\nDear {...},\nNumidium was Tiber Septim's secret weapon in his bid for supreme power: a thousand foot tall automaton, a golem or an atronach of sorts powered by a gem called the Mantella. The Mantella was infused with the life of Tiber Septim's Imperial Battlemage, and with it, Septim crushed all who stood in his way. After the complete and total defeat of all his opponents, Septim began using Numidium to crush the neutral royal families of Tamriel so that he could enthrone only persons he knew to be loyal. His Imperial Battlemage was furious at this use of his creation, and fought to reclaim the Mantella. In the ensuing battle, both the created and the creator were vanquished: the heart they shared blown out of this reality into the netherworld they call &lt;a href=\"Aetherius\"&gt;Aetherius&lt;/a&gt;. Numidium's body was scattered throughout &lt;a href=\"Tamriel\"&gt;Tamriel&lt;/a&gt; and the Imperial Battlemage, without his life force went into a semi-slumber in a subterranean vault. In the centuries that followed, the Emperor's elite soldiers, for generation after generation, collected the pieces of the Numidium and became known as the Blades. Tiber Septim's Imperial Battle Mage became known as the Underking, and sent his forces out to find the Mantella.\nBe warned, therefore. Those who search for the Totem of Tiber Septim are searching for the mechanism the first Emperor of Tamriel used to control Numidium. Should Numidium return, he or she who holds the Totem will control Tamriel's fate.\nA Friend\nDear {...},\nI must tell you about the Totem of Tiber Septim, which all covet. You must know the truth about what you are asked.\nThe Totem was crafted by the original Imperial Battlemage of Tamriel, by orders of Tiber Septim. It is essentially a means of controlling a gargantuan creature called the Numidium. Without it, the Numidium would simply not function. The Imperial Battlemage placed a seal on the Totem so that anyone not of Septim lineage or possessing a special supernatural affinity, such as himself, would be instantly killed if they attempted to use it. The Totem, with the rest of Numidium, was lost during the epic battle between the Imperial Battlemage and his own creation.\nA Friend"}

Now the college is a tomb of knowledge, where grand spells and lofty ideals are left to wither and rot.\nWe should not let the outside world dictate how we conduct ourselves. Placating their ignorance is not a virtue. The augurs speak of a great war on the horizon, and we should be doing everything in our power to prepare for it.\nThat is why Teel-Ja and I have chosen to leave. We know the road ahead will be hard, but one thing we do not lack is the conviction to see it through.\n23rd of Rain's Hand, 3E 428&lt;br&gt;\nConstruction of the tower is almost complete. Teel-Ja accused me of being impatient, a crime which I've been guilty of more often than not. Between us, he has always been the tortoise, and I the hare. Still, our needs are pressing. The coming war will not wait for the mortar to dry.\nThe location has much to do with the delays, but that can't be helped. The Nords are disrespectful of magic by nature, and some would frowned upon our efforts. Others might take a more violent approach. For that reason, we've put a ward on the door that requires magic to dispel.\nWe've chosen to honor Shalidor in much of what we do, including the seal outside the door. Teel-Ja seemed pleased with the idea of setting it on fire, while others seemed uncomfortable with the idea. I warned them that pride is the enemy of progress. If we are to survive the coming storm, we must not be bound by tradition. We must be willing to set it aflame.\n11th of First Seed, 3E 429&lt;br&gt;\nIt's been a year since construction has finished, yet there is still much that needs to be done. The tower is the only foundation for our defense. Our minds and our magic must serve as its ramparts, and for them to hold we must amplify our strength.\nAs such, I have sent scouts throughout Tamriel to find powerful artifacts that may help us in our efforts; artifacts the college wizards refused to obtain out of cowardice or comfort. Many of these relics played a role in preventing calamities of the past. Perhaps it is their destiny as much as ours to stand between the world and its ruin.\n17th of Frost Fall, 3E 429&lt;br&gt;\nWe've had little luck finding artifacts of note. Based on the information I've culled from the &lt;a href=\"The%20Arcanaeum\"&gt;Arcanaeum&lt;/a&gt; records, I know there are several here in Skyrim, including the &lt;a href=\"Staff%20of%20Jyrik%20Gauldurson\"&gt;Staff of Gauldur&lt;/a&gt;. We must endeavor to find them all.\nMore concerning, however, is the disposition and morale of the mages. Even Teel-Ja seems to have falling into the trappings of routine and idleness. It is hard to convince weary souls to explore yet another ruin when the task has been stripped of all urgency.\n29th of Sun's Height, 3E 433&lt;br&gt;\nIt's now halfway through the year 433, more than ten years since we left the college. Yet all remains blissfully calm. One of the new acolytes even suggested abandoning her training to become a cook, happily showing me her spell for preserving apple pies. I reminded her that she is here to study battle magic, not pastries. She will have more than enough time to indulge her sweet tooth once her youth is behind her.\nIt is why we've devoted half the library to the placement of powerful artifacts, to serve as a reminder of our pursuit. Yet seeing the racks as they are now, collecting only dust, makes me wonder if I've led us all astray.\nAs leader of this guild, I have the training to fight and the knowledge of what's to come. What I don't have, sadly, is the conviction that it will.\n28th of Last Seed, 3E 433&lt;br&gt;\nA courier came by with news from Cyrodiil. &lt;a href=\"Uriel%20Septim%20VII\"&gt;Emperor Septim&lt;/a&gt; is dead. The gates of &lt;a href=\"Oblivion\"&gt;Oblivion&lt;/a&gt; have opened. Divines help us all."}

Elrindir works the counter at The Drunken Huntsman, whereas Anoriath sells hunting goods and meats in the market from 8 AM - 7 PM just outside of &lt;a href=\"The%20Bannered%20Mare\"&gt;The Bannered Mare&lt;/a&gt;.\nAnoriath is one of the victims of the Dark Brotherhood contracts. If he dies, his coffin can be found in the &lt;a href=\"Whiterun%20Hall%20of%20the%20Dead\"&gt;Whiterun Hall of the Dead&lt;/a&gt;. If the &lt;a href=\"Last%20Dragonborn\"&gt;Dragonborn&lt;/a&gt; kills him or his brother, the surviving brother may send &lt;a href=\"Hired%20Thug\"&gt;hired thugs&lt;/a&gt; to avenge the killing.\nAccording to his brother when asked how they came up with the name \"The Drunken Huntsman,\" he says that one night he and his brother became intoxicated by drinking a large amount of mead. When they went on a hunting trip, they got lost and were separated. Anoriath saw his brother and mistook him as a deer and accidentally shot him with a bow. After the adventure, they decided to have it as the name of their shop. If asked, Anoriath says he hunts most of the meat himself.\nPersonality.\nAnoriath is generally friendly when interacted with and seems to be a keen huntsman, as suggested when he tells the Dragonborn that he hunted all of the game he sells at his stall himself, and that it is 'fresh from the wilds', even though it is rare to see him or his brother outside of Whiterun.\nQuests.\n&lt;a href=\"Nazir\"&gt;Nazir&lt;/a&gt; gives the &lt;a href=\"Last%20Dragonborn\"&gt;Dragonborn&lt;/a&gt; a contract to kill Anoriath in &lt;a href=\"Whiterun%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Whiterun&lt;/a&gt;. It is easiest to assassinate him when he is at his shop. During the quest he will say \"Well now, you are a strange one. You remind me a bit of myself, when I'm stalking a deer. I'm not quite sure how I feel about that...\" when the Dragonborn walks by.\n&lt;a href=\"Hired%20Muscle\"&gt;Hired Muscle&lt;/a&gt;.\nAnoriath is one of the radiant targets that can be brawled as a part of the quest.\nDialogue.\n\"The finest cuts, fresh from the wilds!\"\n\"Good hunting.\"\n\n\"You're making me... nervous. Is there something you need?\"\n\"I find your presence... unnerving. Please depart.\"\nConversations.\nAnoriath: \"I don't suppose you're going to buy something this time?\"\nBrenuin: \"Just browsin' today. If the gods be kind, someone will take mercy on me and spare a few Septims.\"\nAnoriath: \"If they do, promise you'll actually purchase something for once.\"\nBrenuin: \"By Ysmir, I will. Gods know it's been too long since I tasted real meat.\"\nAnoriath: \"\"I've been thinking of hunting out beyond the boundaries of &lt;a href=\"Whiterun%20Hold\"&gt;Whiterun Hold&lt;/a&gt;.\"\"\nElrindir: \"Again? You just had an 'extended hunt' last month. To the pine forest, wasn't it?\"\nAnoriath: \"That was three days. I'm thinking more like three weeks.\"\nElrindir: \"Three weeks? You're mad! You can't keep the stand closed for that long!\"\nAnoriath: \"Why not? Business has been terrible. Most folk would rather hunt their own meat than buy ours.\"\nElrindir: \"Nonsense. That's just an excuse for you to avoid working, and 'commune with the greenwood like our fathers of old' and blah blah.\"\nAnoriath: \"Congratulations, brother. You've been living in Skyrim so long, you've become a Nord.\"\nElrindir: \"At least the Nords don't shirk their responsibilities.\"\nElrindir: \"Our stock of arrows is running a bit low.\"\nAnoriath: \"All right. I'll fletch some more when I get the time.\"\nElrindir: \"\"Good. I'll do the same. We've still got plenty of shafts from that &lt;a href=\"Riverwood%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Riverwood&lt;/a&gt; shipment.\"\"\nAnoriath: \"It's been two months, and no word from father.\"\nElrindir: \"Don't worry, brother. I'm sure he's fine. We've waited longer before receiving a letter.\"\nAnoriath: \"Might be worth riding out to Solitude, see if a messenger ship's come in.\"\nElrindir: \"If it'll put your mind at ease, then I agree. But not now, all right? We need the business from the stand.\"\nNazeem: \"Do you have anything even remotely fresh?\"\nAnoriath: \"I can assure you, it's all fresh. I hunt the game myself, every day.\"\nNazeem: \"Hmm. As you say.\"\nAnoriath: \"Maybe you'd like to try the horker? Or some beef?\"\nNazeem: \"You don't prepare the meat with any of those strange Elven spices, do you?\"\nAnoriath: \"Ahhhh... No, no Elven spices; just some salt, to preserve it. You're not afraid of salt, are you?\"\nNazeem: \"I'm not 'afraid' of anything. I simply prefer quality merchandise. No, no this meat won't do at all. Too much fat, and it all smells... wrong.\"\nAnoriath: \"Suit yourself, then. The woods are that way. Outside the walls, walk straight ahead. Can't miss them. Good luck on your hunt.\"\nNazeem: \"Good day.\"\nAnoriath: \"Ah, Olfina. How may I help you?\"\nOlfina: \"Got any sausages? I'm cooking a special breakfast for a friend, and they're his favorite.\"\nAnoriath: \"Would your good friend be named Jon, by any chance? I've spied the two of you talking quite intimately.\" or \"Glad to see you're making new friends. I know Jon's death was hard on you.\"\nOlfina: \"Best you forget whatever you think you saw, elf. Such idle talk can prove hazardous to one's health.\"\nYsolda: \"I've got a recipe for venison stew that I want to try out. Will you have venison anytime soon?\"\nAnoriath: \"Certainly. I'll be sure to bring some back for you the next time I go hunting.\"\nYsolda: \"Make it quick, and there might be a bowl of hot stew in it for you.\""}

Through the power of these wards, it is impossible to raise the consecrated dead throughout all the Alik'r.\nEffects.\nSo long as these wards are in good hands, &lt;a href=\"Tu%27whacca\"&gt;Tu'whacca&lt;/a&gt; will prevent necromancers from raising the consecrated dead; those who had his priests perform the rites at their funeral. However, the wards cannot protect the bodies that were not consecrated, for example those lost at sea or those who were raised immediately after being slain, before a priest could consecrate their remains. In addition, if the Wards fall into the hands of the Necromancers themselves, their powers will cease and the consecrated dead will be without the protection of Tu'whacca. If returned to the birthplaces of the Ansei who created them, the Wards can even be corrupted into tools for absorbing the energy from the dead and making oneself into a &lt;a href=\"Lich\"&gt;Lich&lt;/a&gt;.\nHistory.\nWhen the &lt;a href=\"Ra%20Gada\"&gt;Ra Gada&lt;/a&gt; first set foot in &lt;a href=\"Hammerfell\"&gt;Hammerfell&lt;/a&gt;, they were met with hostility from those already inhabiting the land. Among these enemies were Elves who practised the dark art of &lt;a href=\"Necromancy\"&gt;Necromancy&lt;/a&gt;. Since the &lt;a href=\"Redguards\"&gt;Yokudan&lt;/a&gt; faith prohibits them from striking the bodies of their honoured ancestors, the Ra Gada could not effectively fight these Elves or the Redguards they raised. As such, the &lt;a href=\"Ansei\"&gt;Ansei&lt;/a&gt; heroes &lt;a href=\"Ansei%20Maja\"&gt;Maja&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Ansei%20Radan\"&gt;Radan&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Ansei%20Halelah\"&gt;Halelah&lt;/a&gt; sacrificed their animus to Tu'whacca, the Yokudan god of souls, to create the Ansei Wards.\nBy the second era, the Wards were stored in the &lt;a href=\"Impervious%20Vault\"&gt;Impervious Vault&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Sentinel\"&gt;Sentinel&lt;/a&gt;. This vault was built by Grandee &lt;a href=\"Yaghoub\"&gt;Yaghoub&lt;/a&gt; to store the greatest treasures of the Alik'r, after pirates from the &lt;a href=\"Abecean%20Sea\"&gt;Abecean Sea&lt;/a&gt; raided the ports of Sentinel. The vault doors were sealed by a magical barrier that was near impossible to penetrate, though the vault did have one major weakness in that it could be tunneled into, bypassing the doors.\nIn &lt;a href=\"2E%20582\"&gt;2E 582&lt;/a&gt;, a group of necromancers called the &lt;a href=\"Withered%20Hand\"&gt;Withered Hand&lt;/a&gt; tunneled into the vault and stole the wards. Their leaders &lt;a href=\"Uwafa\"&gt;Uwafa&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Alasan\"&gt;Alasan&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Shiri\"&gt;Shiri&lt;/a&gt; took the wards and started raising the consecrated dead all across the Alik'r. Uwafa took the ward of Ansei Radan to &lt;a href=\"Tu%27whacca%27s%20Throne\"&gt;Tu'whacca's Throne&lt;/a&gt; to raise the Yokudan heroes entombed there, Alasan went to Ansei Maja's birthplace, &lt;a href=\"Tava%27s%20Blessing\"&gt;Tava's Blessing&lt;/a&gt;, and tried to use it to become a lich, and Shiri took the ward of Ansei Halelah to the &lt;a href=\"Motalion%20Necropolis\"&gt;Motalion Necropolis&lt;/a&gt; to try and revive her father, the infamous necromancer &lt;a href=\"Suturah\"&gt;Suturah&lt;/a&gt;. All three of them were stopped by &lt;a href=\"Vestige\"&gt;a member&lt;/a&gt; of the &lt;a href=\"Ash%27abah\"&gt;Ash'abah&lt;/a&gt;, after which the Ansei Wards were placed back in the Impervious Vault."}

It is an excavation site into the tomb of &lt;a href=\"Fjori\"&gt;Fjori&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Holgeir\"&gt;Holgeir&lt;/a&gt; and is located northeast of &lt;a href=\"Shor%27s%20Stone%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Shor's Stone&lt;/a&gt; and east of &lt;a href=\"Cragslane%20Cavern\"&gt;Cragslane Cavern&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"The%20Rift%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;the Rift&lt;/a&gt;. Outside the entrance is a ruined stone tower. The entrance is a cave in the mountainside. Ansilvund is a large tomb filled with multiple &lt;a href=\"Traps%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;traps&lt;/a&gt;.\nBackground.\nIt is learned that &lt;a href=\"Lu%27ah%20Al-Skaven\"&gt;Lu'ah Al-Skaven&lt;/a&gt; is overwhelmed with anger and hatred for both the &lt;a href=\"Stormcloaks\"&gt;Stormcloaks&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Septim%20Empire\"&gt;Empire&lt;/a&gt; regarding the loss of her husband, &lt;a href=\"Saeel\"&gt;Saeel&lt;/a&gt;, in battle during the &lt;a href=\"Great%20War\"&gt;Great War&lt;/a&gt;. Lu'ah and her mage lackeys have been raising &lt;a href=\"Draugr%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;draugr&lt;/a&gt; to excavate the site in hopes of raising the legendary Fjori and Holgeir to lead her undead army into battle as a means of ultimate retribution, but more importantly, to use Holgeir as a vessel to resurrect her fallen husband. Her thoughts and motives are chronicled in &lt;a href=\"Lu%27ah%27s%20Journal\"&gt;Lu'ah's Journal&lt;/a&gt;.\nSublocations.\nAnsilvund Excavation.\nThe first level of the site is the excavation level. A number of variously skilled elemental mages and conjurers are encountered here overseeing the tunneling work of their Draugr minions. A conversation can be overheard between three mages around a fire talking about Lu'ah's plans. An &lt;a href=\"Arcane%20Enchanter%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;arcane enchanter&lt;/a&gt; can be found here once the mages are dispatched. Further along, Lu'ah seems to sense the &lt;a href=\"Last%20Dragonborn\"&gt;Dragonborn's&lt;/a&gt; intrusion and awakens the Draugr throughout the corridor.\nThe passageway leading into the next chamber can be found on the left hand side under a lantern on the wall. The next chamber has a trap in the middle of the room that consists of the floor rising to some spikes in the ceiling. If the Dragonborn is crouching, they will not rise high enough to hit these and take damage.\nThe final chamber of Ansilvund Excavations is reached through a &lt;a href=\"Pillar%20Puzzle\"&gt;puzzle room with pillars&lt;/a&gt;. The key (Hawk, Snake, Whale, Snake) can be found directly below each one on the ground level, obscured by weeds and other obstructions including behind the table. Alternately, the combination can be gleaned from paying attention to the animal symbolism used in the book \"&lt;a href=\"Of%20Fjori%20and%20Holgeir\"&gt;Of Fjori and Holgeir&lt;/a&gt;\", which can be found on the table below the stones. The puzzle/lever opens the passage to the next level of the tomb: &lt;a href=\"Ansilvund%20Burial%20Chambers\"&gt;Ansilvund Burial Chambers&lt;/a&gt;.\nAnsilvund Burial Chambers.\nUpon entering the Burial Chambers, it becomes clear that this is, in fact, a well constructed Ancient Nord Tomb. The first hallway is rife with a number of devious traps; however, at the end of this hall there is an adept level locked gate at which a pull chain is located that disables the remaining traps. Also in this room is an expert locked chest with a number of leveled loot within.\nAlso in this section is a leveled draugr attacking a moonstone ore vein, however this vein is not accessible to be mined.\nThe next area is a large three tiered chamber being patrolled by draugr. On the southern wall, the Illusion skill book, \"&lt;a href=\"2920%2C%20vol%2002%20-%20Sun%27s%20Dawn\"&gt;2920, vol 02 - Sun's Dawn&lt;/a&gt;\", can be found atop a pedestal. Taking it will fire arrows, so move to the side after taking the book. On the western wall, the Ansilvund Key is also located atop a pedestal. This key will open all the otherwise very difficult gates along the upcoming path. Removing the key will also awaken a number of draugr. The path then winds up through each tier of the chamber, which, as seen previously, is riddled with a number of nasty traps, which include fire and a spiked wall.\nOn the final leg of the journey, more minions are awakened by Lu'ah's calls to stop the intruder. Upon reaching the Burial Chamber proper, Lu'ah is found with her raised minions, Fjori and Holgeir, as well as the lifeless corpse of her beloved. All three combatants are highly skilled and present a difficult fight. Lu'ah is a skilled Ice Mage, and both Fjori and Holgeir are capable of disarming with &lt;a href=\"Dragon%20Shouts\"&gt;Dragon Shouts&lt;/a&gt; and carry Frost enchanted weapons. Destroying Lu'ah first and quickly will defeat all other foes. One easy way to defeat them is use the ice form shout on Fjori and Holgeir and then focus on Lu'ah. Another method is to use a sneak attack on Lu'ah and then once Lu'ah is defeated, the other two will also be instantly killed. Once defeated, Fjori and Holgeir's spirits are freed from Lu'ah's spell and will thank the &lt;a href=\"Last%20Dragonborn\"&gt;Dragonborn&lt;/a&gt; by presenting the &lt;a href=\"Ghostblade\"&gt;Ghostblade&lt;/a&gt; before returning to the &lt;a href=\"Void\"&gt;Void&lt;/a&gt;.\nTrivia.\nStorm Mage 1: \"\"I think it's sweet that &lt;a href=\"Lu%27ah%20Al-Skaven\"&gt;Lu'ah&lt;/a&gt; is so worked up over her dead soldier...\"\nStorm Mage 2: \"Yeah, but raising &lt;a href=\"Draugr%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Draugr&lt;/a&gt; to fight both the &lt;a href=\"Imperial%20Legion%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Imperials&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Stormcloaks\"&gt;Stormcloaks&lt;/a&gt;?

Hasphat asks for an ancient artifact to be retrieved from a &lt;a href=\"Dwemer%20Ruins%20%28Morrowind%29\"&gt;Dwemer Ruin&lt;/a&gt; and delivered to him before sharing the &lt;a href=\"Hasphat%27s%20Notes%20for%20Cosades\"&gt;information&lt;/a&gt;.\nWalkthrough.\nHasphat Antabolis.\nHasphat will confirm that he does indeed have information for Caius. However, he wants something in return: A &lt;a href=\"Dwemer%20Puzzle%20Box%20%28Morrowind%29\"&gt;Dwemer Puzzle Box&lt;/a&gt;. He then explains that one can be found in &lt;a href=\"Arkngthand\"&gt;Arkngthand&lt;/a&gt;, northeast of &lt;a href=\"Moonmoth%20Legion%20Fort\"&gt;Moonmoth Legion Fort&lt;/a&gt;. The Nerevarine will journey on foot to the ancient citadel, with the help of Hasphat's instructions. Following the road to &lt;a href=\"Molag%20Mar%20%28Morrowind%29\"&gt;Molag Mar&lt;/a&gt; until a fork at the foot of hill, then taking the path that goes up that hill. Then, a little further, the ancient city of Arkngthand can be seen beyond a bridge that spans over the &lt;a href=\"Foyada%20Mamaea\"&gt;Foyada Mamaea&lt;/a&gt;. A bandit, &lt;a href=\"Snowy%20Granius\"&gt;Snowy Granius&lt;/a&gt;, is guarding the bridge.\nArkngthand.\nAfter dealing with the bandit and a few &lt;a href=\"Cliff%20Racer\"&gt;Cliff Racer&lt;/a&gt;s, across the bridge, there is a little serpentine path going up. It leads around the scattered ruined towers of the citadel, to the main entrance. The doorway is hidden behind a round stone. Once the Nerevarine activates a handle on a pipe not far from the door, as indicated by Hasphat, the stone will reveal the entrance. It leads directly into a large cavern, called Hall of Centrifuge, one of the maze-like sublocations of the ruins.\nFrom the entrance, some stairs followed by a stone ledge lead all the way down, where &lt;a href=\"Frink%20Ruuz\"&gt;Frink Ruuz&lt;/a&gt; is guarding three large doors. Above these doors there is another ledge, which can be accessed by a ramp on the side. On this ledge, another door, hidden on the side, opens into the Cells of Hollow Hand. Inside &lt;a href=\"Boss%20Crito\"&gt;Boss Crito&lt;/a&gt; is patrolling. It is within this small cell that the Dwemer box can be found. It is located on the lower shelf on the southern side of the room, there are many crates, around the room, filled with low level loot. After dispatching the hostile bandits, the Nerevarine will acquire the Dwemer Puzzle Box and may choose to leave and return, or delve further into the citadel. This can be done, either through one of the three doors into the Weepingbell Hall, on the west side of the Hall of Centrifuge or on the east side, a little further back up the rocky ledge, into the other Cell of Hollow Hand. Each room and each corridor is patrolled by bandits, &lt;a href=\"Dwemer\"&gt;Dwemer&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Animunculi\"&gt;Animunculi&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Dwarven%20Spectre\"&gt;Dwarven Spectre&lt;/a&gt;s.\nReturn to Hasphat Antabolis.\nOnce back in the Fighters Guild, in &lt;a href=\"Balmora%20%28Morrowind%29\"&gt;Balmora&lt;/a&gt;, the Nerevarine will return the Puzzle Box to Hasphat. He will keep his promise and offer \"&lt;a href=\"Hasphat%27s%20Notes%20for%20Cosades\"&gt;Hasphat's Notes for Cosades&lt;/a&gt;\" (Which can be read with no penalty). It is now possible to return to Caius Cosades with the note for the completion of the quest, and receive the reward.\nOptional: Delving deeper into Arkngthand.\nIf the Nerevarine did not have a high enough &lt;a href=\"Lock%20%28Morrowind%29\"&gt;lockpicking&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Skills%20%28Morrowind%29\"&gt;skill&lt;/a&gt; during the visit to &lt;a href=\"Arkngthand\"&gt;Arkngthand&lt;/a&gt;, it is possible, after completion of this quest, to return and speak to Hasphat about the Puzzle Box. He will reveal to the Nerevarine that it was, in fact, a plan for a &lt;a href=\"Keys%20%28Morrowind%29%23Key%20to%20Lower%20Arkngthand\"&gt;Key&lt;/a&gt;, which he will offer. The Key can be used to open the doors that can be found further within the citadel, to encounter higher level enemies and find valuable loot."}

Also, the &lt;a href=\"Dunmer\"&gt;Dunmer&lt;/a&gt; people of &lt;a href=\"Morrowind\"&gt;Morrowind&lt;/a&gt; seem to use Daedric symbols in some of their writings, often as names of locations written on banners.\nThere is believed to be no actual Daedric language, a common misconception; only Daedric letters substituted for their Tamrielic equivalents. Some may refer to the Daedric alphabet as a font, but most Daedric letters are too dissimilar to be associated with their English equivalents. Neither are they symbols, runes, glyphs, etc. However, there are some accounts of being able to calm hostile Daedra by speaking to them in a \"&lt;a href=\"Daedric%20%28Skill%29\"&gt;Daedric&lt;/a&gt;\" tongue. There are also some accounts of Daedra using new words which have no known equivalent in Tamrielic.\nHistory and origins.\nThe Daedric alphabet is the written form used by the Daedra and &lt;a href=\"Dunmer\"&gt;Dunmer&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"Tamriel\"&gt;Tamriel&lt;/a&gt;. The alphabet is strongly affiliated with &lt;a href=\"magicka\"&gt;magicka&lt;/a&gt;. Daedric letters are often referred to as sigils, with various scrolls and tomes, such as the &lt;a href=\"Mysterium%20Xarxes\"&gt;Mysterium Xarxes&lt;/a&gt;, written in the Daedric alphabet. The exact source of the alphabet is unknown, it is believed to be the creation of the Daedra themselves, then passed down to the mortal realm. Various symbols have Daedric glyphs, as it is the dialect of change.\nThe PC versions of and were shipped with a Daedric True Type Font.\nWriting customs.\nIn &lt;a href=\"Morrowind\"&gt;Morrowind&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"Dunmer\"&gt;Dunmer&lt;/a&gt; peoples often write words in a cluster form, instead of the standard left to right. Though in , none of the Daedric writings seen in the game are written in cluster form. It would seem that the word cluster is a Dunmer custom, thus being found prominently throughout Morrowind.\nCharacter set.\nThe Daedra use their own calligraphy, but the underlying language is closely similar to the modern Cyrodilic language. The naming convention of the Daedric lettering strongly resembles that of the real-world Phoenician alphabet. The following is the best known Daedric character set.\nSpelling variations.\nSome letters have alternate forms of spelling. This is due to inconsistencies of these letters throughout the video game series.\nThe follow is a list of letters with alternate spellings:\nX and Y.\nTypically the \"X\" (Xayah) and \"Y\" (Yakhem) were often omitted in , though there are some instances in which they were used, such as \"y\" in \"Tel Fyr,\" or the \"X\" on the inscription \"EFCPHEQX\" found on the &lt;a href=\"Daedric%20Battle%20Axe%20%28Morrowind%29\"&gt;Daedric Battle Axe&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe letter \"Y\" is used in such as on the &lt;a href=\"Mages%20Guild\"&gt;Mages Guild&lt;/a&gt; seal, yet the \"Y\" is omitted in the Mysterium Xarxes and on the &lt;a href=\"Gray%20Cowl%20of%20Nocturnal\"&gt;Gray Cowl of Nocturnal&lt;/a&gt;: \"Shadow Hide ou.\"\nPervasiveness of the \"O\" symbol.\nOht (the Daedric letter for \"O\") is commonly used to represent the symbol for &lt;a href=\"Oblivion%20%28Realm%29\"&gt;Oblivion&lt;/a&gt;. Oblivion and &lt;a href=\"Oblivion%20Gate\"&gt;Oblivion Gate&lt;/a&gt;s, both in concept art, and on the in-game map is the Daedric letter for \"O.\" The \"O\" appears again in on the hilt of &lt;a href=\"Mehrunes%27%20Razor%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Mehrunes Razor&lt;/a&gt;, on &lt;a href=\"Spell%20Tomes%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Spell Tomes&lt;/a&gt;, on &lt;a href=\"Skill%20Books%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Skill Books&lt;/a&gt; associated with the school of &lt;a href=\"Conjuration%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Conjuration&lt;/a&gt; and on the &lt;a href=\"Forgotten%20Names\"&gt;gauntlet&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"The%20Midden\"&gt;The Midden&lt;/a&gt; under the &lt;a href=\"College%20of%20Winterhold%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;College of Winterhold&lt;/a&gt;.\nFont.\nYou can find a Daedric lettering font for download &lt;a href=\"http%3A//www.dafont.com/daedra.font\"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.

The process of binding a spirit to the metal is unpleasant for the victim, and the armor pieces often retain echoes of preternaturally prolonged suffering endured during manufacture.\nFor thousands of years, the exact way to produce Daedric equipment had remained a mystery to many people. Many believed them to originate only in the realm of Oblivion itself. Whoever discovered the process of forging Daedric equipment will remain a mystery, but the process itself will not. Daedric armor and weapons are created from &lt;a href=\"ebony\"&gt;ebony&lt;/a&gt;, the supernaturally strong metal that is mined almost exclusively from the volcanic island of &lt;a href=\"Vvardenfell\"&gt;Vvardenfell&lt;/a&gt;, in the province of &lt;a href=\"Morrowind\"&gt;Morrowind&lt;/a&gt;. Ebony is the principle component, but at the opportune moment a &lt;a href=\"Daedra%20Heart%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;daedra heart&lt;/a&gt; must be thrown into the fire. Daedric Armor glows red at night, just like &lt;a href=\"Glass%20Armor%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;Glass armor&lt;/a&gt; which glows green at night.\nLegend speaks that the armor must be forged under a new or full moon \u2014 A red harvest moon is best \u2014 but never during an eclipse.\nAcquisition.\nIn , it appears at &lt;a href=\"Character%20Level\"&gt;level 20&lt;/a&gt;, and can be obtained outside the &lt;a href=\"Oblivion%20%28Realm%29\"&gt;Oblivion planes&lt;/a&gt;, most often on &lt;a href=\"Vampire%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;vampires&lt;/a&gt;, high level Dremora, and &lt;a href=\"Character%20Level%23Leveled%20items%20and%20creatures\"&gt;leveled enemies&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Caves%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;caves&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Dungeons\"&gt;Dungeons&lt;/a&gt;.

A myth arose surrounding their exodus, wherein their chieftain is said to have thrown his \"mighty hammer, Volendrung, across Tamriel, promising to lead his clansmer to 'wherever it should fall.'\"\nVolendrung reappears throughout the series, befitting the hammer's description as an item \"prone to disappearing suddenly, resurfacing sometimes in days, sometimes in eons.\"\n&lt;a href=\"Wabbajack\"&gt;Wabbajack&lt;/a&gt; (&lt;a href=\"Sheogorath\"&gt;Sheogorath&lt;/a&gt;).\nWhile this weapon makes no appearance in , it originally shows up in .

Here, Dagon succeeded in destroying the city of Mournhold before being cast back into Oblivion by the combined efforts of the Living Gods &lt;a href=\"Almalexia\"&gt;Almalexia&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Sotha%20Sil\"&gt;Sotha Sil&lt;/a&gt;.\nDagon was responsible for the destruction of &lt;a href=\"Ald%20Sotha%20%28Morrowind%29\"&gt;Ald Sotha&lt;/a&gt;, ancient home of the &lt;a href=\"Dunmer\"&gt;Dunmer&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"House%20Sotha\"&gt;House Sotha&lt;/a&gt; and reported birthplace of Sotha Sil.\nBattlespire.\nToward the end of the &lt;a href=\"Third%20Era\"&gt;Third Era&lt;/a&gt;, when &lt;a href=\"Imperial%20Battlemage\"&gt;Imperial Battlemage&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Jagar%20Tharn\"&gt;Jagar Tharn&lt;/a&gt; rose to seize power, he was aided by Mehrunes Dagon. Further, Dagon assisted Tharn by attacking the Imperial Battle College in the &lt;a href=\"Battlespire\"&gt;Battlespire&lt;/a&gt;. Here, Dagon employed the power of his Daedric Forces. Many Daedric creatures that normally served other &lt;a href=\"Daedric%20Princes\"&gt;Daedric Princes&lt;/a&gt; aided Dagon in this attack. The Daedra overtook the Battlespire and killed nearly everyone inside. The siege would eventually be lifted by the combined efforts of a mysterious hero and the old man &lt;a href=\"Chimere%20Graegyn\"&gt;Chimere Graegyn&lt;/a&gt;, and Dagon cast back into Oblivion. The Battlespire, along with any surviving Daedra, was destroyed.\nOblivion Crisis.\nCertainly the most famous display of power from the Daedric Forces of Destruction was during the &lt;a href=\"Oblivion%20Crisis\"&gt;Oblivion Crisis&lt;/a&gt;, where Mehrunes Dagon sought to conquer all of Tamriel. In order for Dagon's Forces to invade however, the emperor and his heirs had to be removed. This task fell to the &lt;a href=\"Mythic%20Dawn\"&gt;Mythic Dawn&lt;/a&gt;, who succeeded in &lt;a href=\"Assassination%20of%20Uriel%20Septim%20VII\"&gt;assassinating&lt;/a&gt; Emperor Uriel Septim VII. This doused the divine &lt;a href=\"Dragonfires\"&gt;Dragonfires&lt;/a&gt; and allowed Gates to Oblivion to be opened all across Tamriel. The first attack made by the Daedra was on the city of &lt;a href=\"Kvatch%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;Kvatch&lt;/a&gt;. Following the &lt;a href=\"Battle%20of%20Kvatch\"&gt;Battle of Kvatch&lt;/a&gt;, Oblivion Gates were opened in earnest by the Mythic Dawn, allowing the Daedra to roam the countryside while the main army focused on attacking the major cities.\nThis invasion was to be foiled by the combined efforts of the last surviving heir to the throne, &lt;a href=\"Martin%20Septim\"&gt;Martin Septim&lt;/a&gt;, and the eponymous &lt;a href=\"Hero%20of%20Kvatch\"&gt;Hero of Kvatch&lt;/a&gt;. Time and again, the Hero took the battle into Oblivion itself, fighting off the Daedric Forces of Destruction. After a particularly harrowing defeat at the city of &lt;a href=\"Bruma\"&gt;Bruma&lt;/a&gt;, as well as the fall of the Mythic Dawn during the Hero's raid on Mythic Dawn leader &lt;a href=\"Mankar%20Camoran\"&gt;Mankar Camoran&lt;/a&gt;'s realm of &lt;a href=\"Gaiar%20Alata\"&gt;Gaiar Alata&lt;/a&gt;, the Daedra launched a final assault on the &lt;a href=\"Imperial%20City\"&gt;Imperial City&lt;/a&gt;. Here, Dagon himself entered the fray, in an attempt to stop Martin Septim re-lighting the Dragonfires. But it was to no avail; using the magical &lt;a href=\"Amulet%20of%20Kings\"&gt;Amulet of Kings&lt;/a&gt;, Martin banished Dagon back into Oblivion, and with him the whole of the Daedric Forces of Destruction.\nForces.\nThe main soldiers of Dagon's army were the &lt;a href=\"Dremora\"&gt;Dremora&lt;/a&gt;, his most loyal and intelligent servants. The rest of his forces were composed of Daedric creatures which served as war beasts, skirmishers, or shock troops. At varying times, Dagon utilized creatures from other Daedric Princes to serve in his army during an invasion. Certainly, a large variety of Daedra served during the Oblivion Crisis, including the &lt;a href=\"Atronach\"&gt;Atronach&lt;/a&gt;s, whose loyalties were ever-changing. Here are lists of the Daedra that served in the Daedric Forces of Destruction during Dagon's invasions:Battlespire\nOblivion Crisis\nIn addition to these Daedra, Dagon also made use of a powerful war machine, the &lt;a href=\"Daedric%20Siege%20Crawler\"&gt;Daedric Siege Crawler&lt;/a&gt;, during his invasion of Tamriel. This machine was capable of destroying entire cities in little to no time, such as in the case of Kvatch. It was destroyed during the Second Battle of Bruma."}

They acted as the defenders of the &lt;a href=\"Daedric%20Realm\"&gt;Daedric Realm&lt;/a&gt; of Madness, the &lt;a href=\"Shivering%20Isles\"&gt;Shivering Isles&lt;/a&gt;. This task was executed primarily during the numerous &lt;a href=\"Greymarch\"&gt;Greymarch&lt;/a&gt;es, when the opposing &lt;a href=\"Daedric%20Forces%20of%20Order\"&gt;Daedric Forces of Order&lt;/a&gt; would sweep the Isles in an attempt to conquer them.\nHistory.\nIt cannot be determined when exactly the Forces of Madness came into being. Sheogorath himself was not a product of the original creation of the &lt;a href=\"Daedra\"&gt;Daedra&lt;/a&gt;. He was, in fact, the alter-ego of &lt;a href=\"Jyggalag\"&gt;Jyggalag&lt;/a&gt;, the Prince of Order, who was cursed with Madness by the other Daedric Princes. When Jyggalag became Sheogorath, and the latter began reforming the Realm of Order into that of Madness, it can be reasonably assumed that the Forces of Madness came into being. Whether they existed previously and came into the Madgod's service, or were created personally by Sheogorath, is unknown. Nevertheless, the two species of humanoid Daedra, &lt;a href=\"Golden%20Saint%20%28Shivering%20Isles%29\"&gt;Golden Saints&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Dark%20Seducer%20%28Shivering%20Isles%29\"&gt;Dark Seducers&lt;/a&gt;, became the new soldiers of Sheogorath's army, tasked with the defense of the Shivering Isles.\nGreymarch.\nThe most notable act of defense the Forces of Madness performed over the eras was certainly during each Greymarch when, due to the nature of his curse, Sheogorath would transform back into Jyggalag and attempt to re-conquer his Realm with the &lt;a href=\"Forces%20of%20Order\"&gt;Forces of Order&lt;/a&gt;. The response to this attack would come from the Forces of Madness, but it was to no avail. Each time, with every millennium that passed, the Saints and Seducers would be defeated by the Knights of Order and Jyggalag would lay waste to the Realm. Then the curse would be renewed, and Sheogorath would be left to rebuild the Isles, as well as his army.\nThis cycle would continue indefinitely until the Fourth Era of Tamriel, when Sheogorath enacted a plan to end the cycle of the Greymarch. By ensuring the Throne of Madness was occupied when Jyggalag came, there was a chance that he would be defeated by the new Madgod. For his successor, Sheogorath chose not one of his own servants, but a mortal, none other than the &lt;a href=\"Hero%20of%20Kvatch\"&gt;Hero of Kvatch&lt;/a&gt;, who had previously defeated &lt;a href=\"Mehrunes%20Dagon\"&gt;Mehrunes Dagon&lt;/a&gt;'s &lt;a href=\"Forces%20of%20Destruction\"&gt;Forces of Destruction&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;a href=\"Oblivion%20Crisis\"&gt;Oblivion Crisis&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe Fourth Era Greymarch truly began when Order launched an offensive on the Fringe of Madness, the entry point of the Shivering Isles. The Madness army was quick to respond, initiating the battle; based in the town of Passwall, Madness fought to hold the line against the Knights of Order until the Hero arrived under Sheogorath's command and led Madness to victory. Madness would continue to hold the Fringe for the rest of the Greymarch.\nOrder's answer to this defeat was a covert assault on one of the strongholds of Madness, either &lt;a href=\"Brellach\"&gt;Brellach&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"Pinnacle%20Rock\"&gt;Pinnacle Rock&lt;/a&gt;. This attack too would be overcome by the Hero. Had Order succeeded in taking the stronghold, it would have meant the end of either the Golden Saints or Dark Seducers. Following &lt;a href=\"Raid%20on%20the%20Fountainhead\"&gt;an attempt&lt;/a&gt; at poisoning the Wellspring of Madness itself, Order made its last attack. The Forces of Madness met those of Order in the Battle of New Sheoth; here the Hero, now the new Madgod, succeeded in defeating Jyggalag and freeing him from the curse, bringing the Greymarch cycle to an end. From that time onward, the Forces of Madness served the new Madgod, the Hero of Kvatch.\nForces.\nThe soldiers of the Daedric Forces of Madness were two similar yet distinctly different forms of humanoid Daedra, the &lt;a href=\"Golden%20Saint%20%28Shivering%20Isles%29\"&gt;Golden Saints&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Dark%20Seducer%20%28Shivering%20Isles%29\"&gt;Dark Seducers&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe Golden Saints\u2014or Aureals, as they called themselves\u2014guarded the land of &lt;a href=\"Mania\"&gt;Mania&lt;/a&gt;. They were based in &lt;a href=\"Brellach\"&gt;Brellach&lt;/a&gt;, a fortress set on a peninsula called &lt;a href=\"Saint%27s%20Watch\"&gt;Saint's Watch&lt;/a&gt;. During the Fourth Era Greymarch, they were led by a Saint named &lt;a href=\"Staada\"&gt;Staada&lt;/a&gt;. The Dark Seducers, or Mazken, were affiliated with &lt;a href=\"Dementia\"&gt;Dementia&lt;/a&gt;. They were based in &lt;a href=\"Pinnacle%20Rock\"&gt;Pinnacle Rock&lt;/a&gt;, which sat on the &lt;a href=\"Madgod%27s%20Boot\"&gt;Madgod's Boot&lt;/a&gt; peninsula. During the Fourth Era Greymarch, they were led by &lt;a href=\"Dylora%20%28Shivering%20Isles%29\"&gt;Dylora&lt;/a&gt;.\nDespite both groups being defenders of the Isles, neither was fond of the other, and they were constantly clashing in a bid for Sheogorath's favor. Certainly the greatest of these clashes was the conflict over &lt;a href=\"Cylarne\"&gt;Cylarne&lt;/a&gt;; that, too, was ended by the Hero during the Battle of Cylarne."}
{"id": "3443", "revid": "17401442", "url": "https://elderscrolls.fandom.com/wiki?curid=3443", "title": "Daedric Forces of Order", "text": "The Daedric Forces of Order were a powerful Daedric army that served the &lt;a href=\"Daedric%20Prince\"&gt;Daedric Prince&lt;/a&gt; of Order, &lt;a href=\"Jyggalag\"&gt;Jyggalag&lt;/a&gt;. Composed of both &lt;a href=\"Daedra\"&gt;Daedra&lt;/a&gt; and mortals, the Forces are most famous for their acts during the numerous &lt;a href=\"Greymarch\"&gt;Greymarch&lt;/a&gt;es.\nHistory.\nThe date of the formation of the Forces of Order is unknown. It is possible that the Forces were one of the first Daedric armies. In the early days of &lt;a href=\"Oblivion%20%28Realm%29\"&gt;Oblivion&lt;/a&gt;, Jyggalag was one of the more powerful Daedric Princes. Using his army, composed at that time of nothing but his Knights of Order, Jyggalag expanded his dominion across Oblivion for millennia. The other Daedra Lords, fearing that Jyggalag's sheer might could one day overwhelm them, banded together and cursed Jyggalag with the very antithesis of his sphere\u2014Madness. They transformed him into a new Daedra Lord, &lt;a href=\"Sheogorath\"&gt;Sheogorath&lt;/a&gt;, Prince of Madness. The Forces of Order summarily vanished with their leader. Sheogorath transformed Jyggalag's realm into his own, the &lt;a href=\"Shivering%20Isles\"&gt;Shivering Isles&lt;/a&gt;.\nGreymarch.\nOrder would not be banished forever, though. By the nature of the curse, Jyggalag was allowed to return at the end of every millennium. The Forces of Order, by extension, would also re-enter the Shivering Isles by way of crystalline &lt;a href=\"Obelisk%20of%20Order\"&gt;obelisks&lt;/a&gt;, remnants of Jyggalag's Realm. The Knights of Order would overwhelm the Isles, and Jyggalag would lay waste to them. When at last Jyggalag had completely re-conquered his Realm, he would be turned back into Sheogorath. Thus was the cycle of the Greymarch, occurring without end for millennia.\nAn end would come eventually, though. Sheogorath, tired of seeing his Realm destroyed time and again, thought up a plan to stop the cycle and end the Greymarch. If the Throne of Madness was occupied when Jyggalag arrived, then there was a chance that he could be defeated and the cycle would end. Sheogorath chose a &lt;a href=\"mortal\"&gt;mortal&lt;/a&gt; to act as his champion, none other than the famous &lt;a href=\"Hero%20of%20Kvatch\"&gt;Hero of Kvatch&lt;/a&gt;, shortly before the beginning of the &lt;a href=\"Fourth%20Era\"&gt;Fourth Era&lt;/a&gt; Greymarch.\nThe war would begin with a frontal assault on the &lt;a href=\"Fringe\"&gt;Fringe&lt;/a&gt; of Madness. Priests of Order\u2014mortal inhabitants of the Shivering Isles that swore allegiance to Jyggalag\u2014reactivated the Great Order Obelisk beneath the &lt;a href=\"Passwall\"&gt;Passwall&lt;/a&gt; Spire in the Fringe, opening a massive doorway through which Order would be able to launch its attack. The subsequent battle would be a major success for Order, until the intervention of the Hero, who managed to infiltrate the Spire and deactivate the Great Obelisk, cutting short Order's offensive. Matters were further complicated by the construction of a new &lt;a href=\"Gatekeeper%20%28Shivering%20Isles%29\"&gt;Gatekeeper&lt;/a&gt;, which prevented Order forces from entering the Isles through the Gates of Madness.\nOrder's offensive was not ended, though. The defection of one of the Dukes of Madness to the Priests of Order brought Order a powerful advantage. The Battle of the Stronghold was the making of the traitor duke, who allowed Order entry into one of the strongholds of the &lt;a href=\"Forces%20of%20Madness\"&gt;Forces of Madness&lt;/a&gt;. This siege would eventually be lifted by the Hero. The traitor duke then formulated the idea of &lt;a href=\"Raid%20on%20the%20Fountainhead\"&gt;attacking&lt;/a&gt; the Wellspring of Madness beneath the &lt;a href=\"New%20Sheoth%20Palace\"&gt;New Sheoth Palace&lt;/a&gt;. This too would be ended by the Hero, and the traitor duke killed in the fighting. Having been stripped of their prime strategist, the Forces of Order were left no other option than a forward assault. The Battle of New Sheoth was begun then, with Order attacking the Palace through two Obelisks in the courtyard. The Hero, having &lt;a href=\"Mantling\"&gt;replaced&lt;/a&gt; Sheogorath as Madgod, led Madness' defense. At the apex of the battle, Jyggalag recalled his Forces and faced the Hero himself. The Hero succeeded in defeating him, ending the Greymarch cycle and freeing Jyggalag from the curse. The Daedric Forces of Order retreated from the Shivering Isles.\nForces.\nThe Forces of Order were composed of only one type of &lt;a href=\"Daedra\"&gt;Daedra&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"Knight%20of%20Order\"&gt;Knight of Order&lt;/a&gt;. These were humanoid Daedra, covered in crystalline armor and wielding &lt;a href=\"Order%20Blade\"&gt;Order Swords&lt;/a&gt;. During the Greymarch, mortals in the Shivering Isles who believed that Order would be victorious betrayed Sheogorath and swore an oath to Jyggalag, becoming &lt;a href=\"Priest%20of%20Order\"&gt;Priests of Order&lt;/a&gt;. These Priests were given power to activate Order Obelisks, and could not be killed so long as the Obelisk was active.\nIn addition to soldiers, the Forces of Order also employed many other items that were affiliated with their sphere. These were:"}

While Daedra can manifest as either &lt;a href=\"LGBTQ%2B\"&gt;male or female&lt;/a&gt; (being, in reality, genderless), all of these high Daedra are typically referred to as \"Princes.\" In all, there are sixteen widely known Princes, with a \"seventeenth\" prince, &lt;a href=\"Jyggalag\"&gt;Jyggalag&lt;/a&gt;, emerging following the events of , at the end of the &lt;a href=\"Third%20Era\"&gt;Third Era&lt;/a&gt;.\nEvery Daedric Prince has their own specific plane of &lt;a href=\"Oblivion%20%28Realm%29\"&gt;Oblivion&lt;/a&gt;, which reflects their nature.\nOrigins.\nThe Daedric Princes are those &lt;a href=\"et%27Ada\"&gt;et'Ada&lt;/a&gt; who, when &lt;a href=\"Lorkhan\"&gt;Lorkhan&lt;/a&gt; proposed the creation of &lt;a href=\"Mundus\"&gt;Mundus&lt;/a&gt;, did not take part but rather created domains out of themselves in &lt;a href=\"Oblivion%20%28Realm%29\"&gt;Oblivion&lt;/a&gt;. There are also accounts of other et'Ada becoming Daedric Princes after the creation of Mundus, which also involves the creation of their own realms of Oblivion.\nMortal interactions.\nThroughout Tamriel's history, mortals have frequently summoned Daedric Princes, for worship, study or to make deals. These typically involve some sort of bargain with the Prince in question, but not always. It should be noted that dealing with the Princes sometimes causes changes in appearance, such as black dots in the whites of the eyes or strange eye color.\nEach Daedric Prince holds some degree of \"patronage\" over a physical, philosophical, or metaphysical concept or state of being. The varied and wide range of these aspects has nurtured a devoted following among the mortals that hold them as figures of worship- either in spite of or in reaction to the teachings of the Divines. While some of the Princes are unconcerned for the well-being of their followers, with some actively causing harm to them by some means, other Daedric Princes have been known to both reward and actively protect their followers.\nAzura.\nAzura is the Daedric Prince whose sphere is dusk and dawn. Azura is always depicted as a female and is also known as \"Mother of the Rose,\" \"Queen of the Night Sky,\" and the Anticipation of &lt;a href=\"Sotha%20Sil\"&gt;Sotha Sil&lt;/a&gt;. Her artifact is &lt;a href=\"Azura%27s%20Star\"&gt;Azura's Star&lt;/a&gt;. Azura is one of the few Daedra who might be considered \"good\" by mortal standards, due to her concern for her followers' well-being. Azura's plane is known as &lt;a href=\"Moonshadow%20%28Location%29\"&gt;Moonshadow&lt;/a&gt;, a realm said to be too beautiful for mortals to comprehend. The lesser Daedra &lt;a href=\"Winged%20Twilight%20%28Morrowind%29\"&gt;Winged Twilights&lt;/a&gt; are her messengers.\nIt was Azura who told &lt;a href=\"Nerevar\"&gt;Nerevar&lt;/a&gt; that &lt;a href=\"Dagoth%20Ur%20%28Character%29\"&gt;Dagoth Ur's&lt;/a&gt; knowledge of the &lt;a href=\"Heart%20of%20Lorkhan\"&gt;Heart of Lorkhan&lt;/a&gt; was accurate. This caused a war with the &lt;a href=\"Dwemer\"&gt;Dwemer&lt;/a&gt;, from which the &lt;a href=\"Chimer\"&gt;Chimer&lt;/a&gt; emerged the victor, and the &lt;a href=\"Dwemer\"&gt;Dwemer&lt;/a&gt; did not emerge at all. Later, when the &lt;a href=\"Tribunal\"&gt;Tribunal&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"Vivec\"&gt;Vivec&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Almalexia\"&gt;Almalexia&lt;/a&gt;, and Sotha Sil used the power of the Heart of Lorkhan to make themselves gods and thus break their oath to Azura, Azura cursed the &lt;a href=\"Chimer\"&gt;Chimer&lt;/a&gt; with dark greyish skin and red eyes, transforming them into the &lt;a href=\"Dunmer\"&gt;Dunmer&lt;/a&gt;. and claimed that she would cause Nerevar to be reborn and that she would make things right again. Later, Azura aided the &lt;a href=\"Nerevarine\"&gt;Nerevarine&lt;/a&gt; in defeating Dagoth Ur and toppling the &lt;a href=\"Tribunal%20Temple\"&gt;Tribunal Temple&lt;/a&gt;. Azura is also credited for making the &lt;a href=\"Khajiit\"&gt;Khajiit&lt;/a&gt; from &lt;a href=\"Bosmer\"&gt;Bosmer&lt;/a&gt; stock in &lt;a href=\"Elsweyr\"&gt;Elsweyr&lt;/a&gt;.\nShe is also thought to be the sister of &lt;a href=\"Nocturnal\"&gt;Nocturnal&lt;/a&gt;, but whether this is true or not is yet to be known.\nBoethiah.\nBoethiah is the Prince of Plots, who rules over deceit, conspiracy, secret plots of murder, assassination, treason, and unlawful overthrow of authority. Boethiah is depicted (often female) as a great caped warrior, typically taking a stoic pose and is also known as the Anticipation of &lt;a href=\"Almalexia\"&gt;Almalexia&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href=\"Attribution%27s%20Share\"&gt;Attribution's Share&lt;/a&gt; is the Plane of Boethiah; she frequently holds the Tournament of Ten Bloods in this Plane.\nBoethiah is the original god-ancestor of the &lt;a href=\"Dunmer\"&gt;Dunmer&lt;/a&gt;. She guided the &lt;a href=\"Chimer\"&gt;Chimer&lt;/a&gt; to renounce all ties to the &lt;a href=\"Aldmer\"&gt;Aldmer&lt;/a&gt; and led them, through the prophet &lt;a href=\"Veloth\"&gt;Veloth&lt;/a&gt;, to the land of &lt;a href=\"Morrowind\"&gt;Morrowind&lt;/a&gt;. She is seen by the Dunmer as the beginning of their civilization and is credited by them as the fount of inspiration for many cultural achievements.\nBoethiah is connected to several &lt;a href=\"Daedric%20artifacts\"&gt;Daedric artifacts&lt;/a&gt; which have appeared on Tamriel throughout history. These include the &lt;a href=\"Ebony%20Mail\"&gt;Ebony Mail&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Goldbrand\"&gt;Goldbrand&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Fearstruck\"&gt;Fearstruck&lt;/a&gt;.\nClavicus Vile.\nClavicus Vile is the Daedric Prince whose sphere is the granting of power and wishes through ritual invocations and pacts. Clavicus has a companion named &lt;a href=\"Barbas%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Barbas&lt;/a&gt;, who may be a distinct part of Vile while being part of his being. While capable of selective shape-shifting, the form it assumes most of the time is that of a dog, among others. Clavicus himself is depicted as a jovial fellow with horns protruding from his forehead. Clavicus Vile is also noted to be one of the patrons of Cyrodiil's clan of &lt;a href=\"Vampire%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;vampires&lt;/a&gt;.\nClavicus Vile's realm in Oblivion is called \"&lt;a href=\"The%20Fields%20of%20Regret\"&gt;The Fields of Regret&lt;/a&gt;.\" It appears as an idyllic countryside, dotted with merchant utopias, fields of white clovers, woodland meadows, twisted foliage, and odd melted-looking places. The air smells of both perfume and rotting flesh, while the sky is blue with cottony clouds, and greenish-gray streaks that stain the atmosphere.\nVile has also created many Daedric artifacts, among them the &lt;a href=\"Umbra%20Sword\"&gt;Umbra Sword&lt;/a&gt;, the possessed quill &lt;a href=\"Feyfolken\"&gt;Feyfolken&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Masque%20of%20Clavicus%20Vile\"&gt;Masque of Clavicus Vile&lt;/a&gt;.\nHermaeus Mora.\nHermaeus Mora is the Daedric Prince of knowledge and memory. His sphere is the scrying of the tides of fate, of the past and future as read in the stars and heavens, and in his dominion are the treasures of knowledge and memory. His realm is known as &lt;a href=\"Apocrypha\"&gt;Apocrypha&lt;/a&gt;, an endless library where all forbidden knowledge may be found.He may be the \"Woodland Man\" of &lt;a href=\"Atmoran\"&gt;Atmoran&lt;/a&gt; myth who nearly persuaded the Nords to become Aldmer; the secondary set of his name, Mora, is one word for \"\"wood\",\" \"\"woodland\",\" or \"tree(s)\" in &lt;a href=\"Aldmeri%20Language\"&gt;Aldmeris&lt;/a&gt;.\nHermaeus Mora most commonly appears as a rotund mass of tentacles with an abundance of eyes and four disproportionately large lobster-like claws, although he also appears as a grotesque void out of which tentacles appear.\nHis artifacts are all books of one form or another. The most well-known of these, the \"&lt;a href=\"Oghma%20Infinium\"&gt;Oghma Infinium&lt;/a&gt;\", was written by &lt;a href=\"Xarxes\"&gt;Xarxes&lt;/a&gt;, and contains \"knowledge of the ages.\"\nHircine.\nHircine is the Daedric Prince whose sphere is the Hunt, the Sport of Daedra, the Great Game, and the Chase; he is known as the Huntsman and the Father of Manbeasts. Hircine created the various &lt;a href=\"Lycanthropy\"&gt;lycanthropic&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"diseases\"&gt;diseases&lt;/a&gt; which transform mortals into beasts, and is, therefore, the father of were-creatures. His plane of Oblivion is known as &lt;a href=\"Hircine%27s%20Hunting%20Grounds\"&gt;the Hunting Grounds&lt;/a&gt;.\nHircine's statue depicts him as a physically fit man whose whole head is obscured by a deer skull with long antlers. He is armed with a great spear and has a wolf companion. The Reachmen consider that he has five aspects, which relate to a variety of animals and hunters. Hircine communicates directly with were-creatures, and he has been known to give them tasks and rewards. The lesser Daedra &lt;a href=\"Herne%20%28Battlespire%29\"&gt;Herne&lt;/a&gt; is also affiliated with him.\nHircine's artifacts are all associated with hunting or lycanthropy in some way. The &lt;a href=\"Cuirass%20of%20the%20Savior%27s%20Hide\"&gt;Cuirass of the Savior's Hide&lt;/a&gt; was allegedly gifted to a mortal after they escaped Hircine's realm, while the &lt;a href=\"Spear%20of%20Bitter%20Mercy\"&gt;Spear of Bitter Mercy&lt;/a&gt; is an artifact used in a Daedric hunting ritual, and is seen by the Reachmen as Hircine's own weapon. &lt;a href=\"Hircine%27s%20Ring\"&gt;Hircine's Ring&lt;/a&gt; can be used to temporarily bestow lycanthropy on the wearer.\nJyggalag.\nJyggalag is the Prince of Order and is one of the more obscure princes. He was cursed by the other Daedric Princes, who were allegedly afraid of him, to become Sheogorath, only returning to his original form during the &lt;a href=\"Greymarch\"&gt;Greymarch&lt;/a&gt;. He is depicted as a crystalline knight.\nAt the end of the &lt;a href=\"Third%20Era\"&gt;Third Era&lt;/a&gt;, with the Greymarch occurring, the &lt;a href=\"Hero%20of%20Kvatch\"&gt;Hero of Kvatch&lt;/a&gt; defeated Jyggalag, releasing him from his curse, allowing him to remain in his true form and return to Oblivion. \nMalacath.\nMalacath is the Daedric Prince whose sphere is the patronage of the spurned and ostracized, the keeper of the Sworn Oath, and the Bloody Curse. He forms one corner of the &lt;a href=\"House%20of%20Troubles\"&gt;House of Troubles&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Dunmer\"&gt;Dunmer&lt;/a&gt; religion, as well as being a particular enemy of the Nords. Malacath is also called Malouch by &lt;a href=\"Orcs\"&gt;Orcs&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Orkey\"&gt;Orkey&lt;/a&gt; or the Old Knocker by &lt;a href=\"Nords\"&gt;Nords&lt;/a&gt;, who blame him for stealing mankind's long lifespans. Malacath spurns physical weakness.\nHe was created when &lt;a href=\"Boethiah\"&gt;Boethiah&lt;/a&gt; ate the &lt;a href=\"Aedra\"&gt;Aedra&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Trinimac\"&gt;Trinimac&lt;/a&gt;, which also transformed his followers into Orcs. &lt;a href=\"Malacath\"&gt;Malacath&lt;/a&gt; is not recognized as a Daedric Prince by his peers, which fits his sphere perfectly. Some Orcs consider him not to be a Daedra but a demon, instead worshipping Trinimac.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Ashpit\"&gt;Ashpit&lt;/a&gt; is Malacath's realm and is known as to be a harsh place, consisting only of dust, palaces of smoke, and vaporous creatures.\nMalacath's Daedric artifacts tend to be subversions of another artifact or turned against the Daedra themselves. His hammer &lt;a href=\"Volendrung\"&gt;Volendrung&lt;/a&gt; was originally made by the &lt;a href=\"Dwemer\"&gt;Dwemer&lt;/a&gt;, and the &lt;a href=\"Scourge\"&gt;Scourge&lt;/a&gt; is noted to be particularly effective when used against other Daedra. Some sources also claim that he was the one who forged the Savior's Hide.\nMehrunes Dagon.\nMehrunes Dagon is the Daedric Prince of Destruction, Change, Revolution, Energy, and Ambition. He is associated with natural dangers like fire, earthquakes, and floods. He is an especially important deity in &lt;a href=\"Morrowind\"&gt;Morrowind&lt;/a&gt;, where he represents its near-inhospitable terrain and is part of the House of Troubles. In most cultures, however, Dagon is merely a god of bloodshed and betrayal. Dagon's plane of Oblivion is a place of perpetual torture, and is also said to be a blasted landscape. It is known as the &lt;a href=\"Deadlands\"&gt;Deadlands&lt;/a&gt;.\nOf all the Daedric Princes, Mehrunes Dagon seems to have the most animosity toward &lt;a href=\"Nirn\"&gt;Nirn&lt;/a&gt;'s species. Given his nature (Prince of Destruction), along with the fact that Daedra truly cannot be destroyed, the only entities he can practice destruction on are mortals. He assisted &lt;a href=\"Jagar%20Tharn\"&gt;Jagar Tharn&lt;/a&gt; in his temporary usurpation of the Imperial throne by invading and seized control of the &lt;a href=\"Battlespire\"&gt;Battlespire&lt;/a&gt;, the purpose of this being to cripple the capacity of the &lt;a href=\"Imperial%20Battlemage\"&gt;Imperial College of Battlemages&lt;/a&gt;, which presented a threat to Tharn's power as &lt;a href=\"Emperor\"&gt;Emperor&lt;/a&gt;.\nMehrunes Dagon was responsible for the &lt;a href=\"Sack%20of%20Mournhold\"&gt;destruction&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"Mournhold\"&gt;Mournhold&lt;/a&gt; at the end of the &lt;a href=\"First%20Era\"&gt;First Era&lt;/a&gt;, and apparently also destroyed &lt;a href=\"Ald%20Sotha%20%28Morrowind%29\"&gt;Ald Sotha&lt;/a&gt;, home of &lt;a href=\"House%20Sotha\"&gt;House Sotha&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Sotha%20Sil\"&gt;Sotha Sil&lt;/a&gt;'s birthplace.\nDagon invaded Tamriel at the end of the Third Era, precipitating the &lt;a href=\"Oblivion%20Crisis\"&gt;Oblivion Crisis&lt;/a&gt;, where he materialized fully on Tamriel before ultimately being defeated by the &lt;a href=\"Hero%20of%20Kvatch\"&gt;Hero of Kvatch&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Martin%20Septim\"&gt;Martin Septim&lt;/a&gt;.\nDagon's most celebrated artifact is his &lt;a href=\"Mehrunes%27%20Razor\"&gt;Razor&lt;/a&gt;, which was said to have been made in &lt;a href=\"Lyg\"&gt;Lyg&lt;/a&gt; by the &lt;a href=\"Magna%20Ge\"&gt;Magna Ge&lt;/a&gt;. He is also associated with the &lt;a href=\"Daedric%20Crescent\"&gt;Daedric Crescent&lt;/a&gt;s, used by his forces in the invasion of the Battlespire, after which all but one of them were destroyed.\nMephala.\nMephala is a Daedric Prince known by the names Webspinner, Spinner, &lt;a href=\"Spider\"&gt;Spider&lt;/a&gt;, and is associated with sex and secret murder by the Dunmer, and is the Anticipation of &lt;a href=\"Vivec\"&gt;Vivec&lt;/a&gt;. Her realm of Oblivion is known as the &lt;a href=\"Spiral%20Skein\"&gt;Spiral Skein&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Morag%20Tong\"&gt;Morag Tong&lt;/a&gt; is a cult of assassins that was, at least initially, devoted to her worship. She is also associated with the &lt;a href=\"Spider%20Daedra\"&gt;Spider Daedra&lt;/a&gt;, although she may not have complete control over them.\nHer artifacts share themes of assassination and stealth. She is associated with the &lt;a href=\"Ring%20of%20Khajiit\"&gt;Ring of Khajiit&lt;/a&gt;, the Obsidian Husk and the &lt;a href=\"Ebony%20Blade\"&gt;Ebony Blade&lt;/a&gt;.\nMeridia.\nMeridia is associated with the energies of living things, and bears an extremely vitriolic hatred for the &lt;a href=\"undead\"&gt;undead&lt;/a&gt;. Her realm is known as the &lt;a href=\"Colored%20Rooms\"&gt;Colored Rooms&lt;/a&gt;. She is associated with a race of lesser Daedra known as &lt;a href=\"Aurorans\"&gt;Aurorans&lt;/a&gt;, and was the patron of &lt;a href=\"Umaril\"&gt;Umaril&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Ayleids\"&gt;Ayleids&lt;/a&gt;.\nMeridia is mentioned in some sources alongside the &lt;a href=\"mnemoli\"&gt;Star Orphans&lt;/a&gt;, and is considered by some to be formerly of the &lt;a href=\"Magna%20Ge\"&gt;Magna Ge&lt;/a&gt;, but created her own realm of Oblivion by bending the light of &lt;a href=\"Magnus\"&gt;Magnus&lt;/a&gt; through some form of lens. However, there are accounts which question her association with the Magna Ge.\nIn addition to her hatred of the undead, Meridia also has an enmity for Molag Bal, against whom she acted during the &lt;a href=\"Interregnum\"&gt;Interregnum&lt;/a&gt;, by assisting the &lt;a href=\"Five%20Companions\"&gt;Five Companions&lt;/a&gt;.\nMeridia has been previously associated with the Ring of Khajiit, and gifted her champion with the sword &lt;a href=\"Dawnbreaker\"&gt;Dawnbreaker&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;a href=\"Fourth%20Era\"&gt;Fourth Era&lt;/a&gt;.\nMolag Bal.\nMolag Bal is the Daedric Prince whose sphere is the domination and &lt;a href=\"Slavery\"&gt;enslavement&lt;/a&gt; of mortals. His realm is called &lt;a href=\"Coldharbour\"&gt;Coldharbour&lt;/a&gt;, a twisted dark imitation of &lt;a href=\"Tamriel\"&gt;Tamriel&lt;/a&gt;. He is associated with many forms of domination, and is known by some as the King of Rape. He forms one corner of the House of Troubles in Dunmeri theology. Just as Meridia hates Bal, he also has an enmity against Boethiah.\nMolag Bal is reputed to be the father of &lt;a href=\"vampires\"&gt;vampires&lt;/a&gt;, who he created by ravaging a priestess of &lt;a href=\"Arkay\"&gt;Arkay&lt;/a&gt;. He also allegedly fathered a race of monsters with Vivec.\nHis only known artifact is the &lt;a href=\"Mace%20of%20Molag%20Bal\"&gt;Mace of Molag Bal&lt;/a&gt;, which is also known as the Vampire's Mace.\nNamira.\nNamira is the Daedric Prince whose sphere is the ancient darkness. She is associated with all things generally considered repulsive, including various creatures such as &lt;a href=\"spiders\"&gt;spiders&lt;/a&gt; or slugs and &lt;a href=\"disease\"&gt;disease&lt;/a&gt; that cause any kind of unattractive physical abnormalities. This also includes beggars and their various attributes. According to Khajiit theology, she has a connection to the Heart of Lorkhaj. \nNamira's realm of Oblivion is called the \"&lt;a href=\"Scuttling%20Void\"&gt;Scuttling Void&lt;/a&gt;.\" Very little is known about it beyond its name, as no &lt;a href=\"man\"&gt;man&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"mer\"&gt;mer&lt;/a&gt;, nor &lt;a href=\"beast\"&gt;beast&lt;/a&gt; has ever ventured there and returned.\nChampions of Namira have been known to receive &lt;a href=\"Ring%20of%20Namira%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Namira's ring&lt;/a&gt;, an artifact that restores &lt;a href=\"health\"&gt;health&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"stamina\"&gt;stamina&lt;/a&gt; when \"feasting\" on slain enemies.\nNocturnal.\nNocturnal is the Daedric Prince whose sphere is the night and darkness, also known as the Night Mistress. She is said to not court worshippers, treating them with indifference, although it also seems that the &lt;a href=\"Nightingales\"&gt;Nightingales&lt;/a&gt; are her sworn servants. In addition to literal darkness, her sphere also encompasses the darkness of mystery and unknowing. She is also on occasion called the sister of Azura.\nHer realm of Oblivion is the &lt;a href=\"Evergloam\"&gt;Evergloam&lt;/a&gt;, which has a form of permanent conduit beween Mundus and Oblivion known as the &lt;a href=\"Twilight%20Sepulcher\"&gt;Twilight Sepulcher&lt;/a&gt;.\nNocturnal is associated with two artifacts, the &lt;a href=\"Gray%20Cowl%20of%20Nocturnal\"&gt;Gray Cowl&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Skeleton%20Key%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;Skeleton Key&lt;/a&gt;, both of which aid thieves in their work.\nPeryite.\nPeryite, also known as the Taskmaster, is the Daedric Prince whose sphere is &lt;a href=\"Disease\"&gt;Pestilence&lt;/a&gt;, and he is charged with ordering the lowest levels of &lt;a href=\"Oblivion%20%28Realm%29\"&gt;Oblivion&lt;/a&gt;. He is often depicted as a green &lt;a href=\"Dragons%20%28Lore%29\"&gt;dragon&lt;/a&gt;.\nPeryite's realm of Oblivion is known as \"&lt;a href=\"The%20Pits\"&gt;The Pits&lt;/a&gt;.\" It is here in which the lowest orders of Oblivion are guarded. With a few exceptions, the realm is usually unreachable via mortal devices, and due to the lack of accessibility the majority of information regarding this realm is derived from the reports of other Princes.\nPeryite's artifact is an enchanted shield, the &lt;a href=\"Spell%20Breaker\"&gt;Spell Breaker&lt;/a&gt;, which, protects its bearer against the harmful effects of magic. \nSanguine.\nSanguine is the Daedric Prince whose sphere is hedonistic revelry, debauchery, and passionate indulgences of darker natures.\nSanguine rules over the &lt;a href=\"Myriad%20Realms%20of%20Revelry\"&gt;Myriad Realms of Revelry&lt;/a&gt;, which are places that Sanguine allows any visitors to customize to their whims.\nSanguine is associated with the &lt;a href=\"Sanguine%20Rose\"&gt;Sanguine Rose&lt;/a&gt;, and has bestowed it on favored mortals from time to time. He is also associated with a collection of items made for Mephala, known as the &lt;a href=\"Threads%20of%20the%20Webspinner\"&gt;Threads of the Webspinner&lt;/a&gt;.\nSheogorath.\nSheogorath is the infamous Prince of Madness, whose motives are unknowable. His realm in Oblivion is the &lt;a href=\"Shivering%20Isles\"&gt;Shivering Isles&lt;/a&gt;, and he is served by the &lt;a href=\"Golden%20Saint%20%28Shivering%20Isles%29\"&gt;Golden Saints&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Dark%20Seducer%20%28Shivering%20Isles%29\"&gt;Dark Seducers&lt;/a&gt;. He forms one of the corners of the House of Troubles in Dunmeri theology. He is frequently depicted as playing tricks on both mortals and other Daedra.\nSheogorath has been called the \"&lt;a href=\"Sithis\"&gt;Sithis&lt;/a&gt;-shaped hole\" of the world, created when Lorkhan's heart was torn out. However, other sources indicate he was once Jyggalag, Prince of Order, condemned by the other Daedric Princes to spend most of his existence mad, apart from the time known as the Greymarch where he crusaded against the Shivering Isles. During the late Third Era, the Hero of Kvatch successfully resisted Jyggalag, and the two princes became separate entities.\nThere are many artifacts associated with Sheogorath, including several staffs, the most notorious being the &lt;a href=\"Wabbajack\"&gt;Wabbajack&lt;/a&gt;, which is enchanted to transform or cause death to the caster's target. Others include the &lt;a href=\"Staff%20of%20the%20Everscamp\"&gt;Staff of the Everscamp&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Staff%20of%20Sheogorath\"&gt;Staff of Sheogorath&lt;/a&gt;, as well as the glove &lt;a href=\"Gambolpuddy\"&gt;Gambolpuddy&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"The%20Fork%20of%20Horripilation\"&gt;The Fork of Horripilation&lt;/a&gt;, and the lesser known artifact, the &lt;a href=\"Folium%20Discognitum\"&gt;Folium Discognitum&lt;/a&gt;, a powerful book containing the insights of madmen. He, along with Hircine, the Prince of the Hunt, has an association with the &lt;a href=\"Spear%20of%20Bitter%20Mercy\"&gt;Spear of Bitter Mercy&lt;/a&gt;.\nVaermina.\nVaermina is the Daedric Prince whose sphere is the realm of dreams and nightmares, and evil omens. Her plane of Oblivion is &lt;a href=\"Quagmire\"&gt;Quagmire&lt;/a&gt;. It is described as a nightmare realm, where every few minutes reality shifts and becomes ever more horrifying. For example, when lightning strikes that may trigger reality to shift again; it could become anything: a dark castle, a den of terrifying beasts, a moonlit swamp, or even a casket in which one sees oneself buried.\nThe priests of Vaermina are masters of alchemy. One concoction of theirs can be worth tens of thousands of septims on the black market. &lt;a href=\"Vaermina%27s%20Torpor\"&gt;Vaermina's Torpor&lt;/a&gt; is particularly sought after for its ability to let imbibers enter a state known as \"The Dreamstride\", allowing them to enter the dreams of another person.\nShe is associated with the artifact the &lt;a href=\"Skull%20of%20Corruption\"&gt;Skull of Corruption&lt;/a&gt;. She is also associated with an orb, stolen by the wizard &lt;a href=\"Arkved\"&gt;Arkved&lt;/a&gt; in the late Third Era, which led to her realm."}

The Nerevarine may complete these quests at any time and will be rewarded with a &lt;a href=\"Daedric%20Artifact\"&gt;rare treasure&lt;/a&gt; from the Prince upon completion of their task.\n&lt;a href=\"Azura%27s%20Quest\"&gt;Azura's Quest&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe Daedric Princess &lt;a href=\"Azura\"&gt;Azura&lt;/a&gt; will request that the Nerevarine help to settle a bet in her favour. Azura and &lt;a href=\"Sheogorath\"&gt;Sheogorath&lt;/a&gt; had previously made a wager concerning a priestess by the name of Rayna Drolan in the &lt;a href=\"Sheogorad\"&gt;Sheogorad&lt;/a&gt; region, and Sheogorath has gone against the bet by sending several of his associated &lt;a href=\"daedra\"&gt;daedra&lt;/a&gt; to distract Drolan from her task. The Nerevarine must remove the distractions and find evidence of Sheogorath's involvement.\nAs a reward, the Nerevarine is allowed to keep the &lt;a href=\"Sheogorath%27s%20Signet%20Ring\"&gt;evidence&lt;/a&gt; they found, plus, Azura will give the Nerevarine her &lt;a href=\"Azura%27s%20Star%20%28Morrowind%29\"&gt;Star&lt;/a&gt; (the infamous recharging soul gem). Her shrine can be found on the southeastern tip of Vvardenfell, where the quest begins and ends.\nOne thing of note is that Azura is also heavily featured in the &lt;a href=\"Main%20Quest%20%28Morrowind%29\"&gt;Main Quest&lt;/a&gt; (as she is considered one of the founders of the &lt;a href=\"Dunmer\"&gt;Dunmer&lt;/a&gt; species), although this quest has nothing to do with the Main Quest.\n&lt;a href=\"Boethiah%27s%20Quest%20%28Morrowind%29\"&gt;Boethiah's Quest&lt;/a&gt;.\n&lt;a href=\"Boethiah\"&gt;Boethiah&lt;/a&gt; will contact the Nerevarine at her sunken shrine to the west of &lt;a href=\"Ashurnibibi%20%28Morrowind%29\"&gt;Ashurnibibi&lt;/a&gt;. She demands that the Nerevarine construct for her a new shrine on Vvardenfell. The shrine itself can be built at &lt;a href=\"Khartag%20Point%20%28Morrowind%29\"&gt;Khartag Point&lt;/a&gt; (northwest of &lt;a href=\"Gnaar%20Mok\"&gt;Gnaar Mok&lt;/a&gt;) and will require a substantial amount of gold and a sculptor (by the name of &lt;a href=\"Duma%20gro-Lag\"&gt;Duma gro-Lag&lt;/a&gt;).\nTo reward the Nerevarine, Boethiah grants her most famed item, &lt;a href=\"Goldbrand%20%28Morrowind%29\"&gt;Goldbrand&lt;/a&gt; (which on patched versions of can be upgraded to &lt;a href=\"Eltonbrand\"&gt;Eltonbrand&lt;/a&gt;).\n&lt;a href=\"Malacath%27s%20Quest\"&gt;Malacath's Quest&lt;/a&gt;.\n&lt;a href=\"Malacath\"&gt;Malacath&lt;/a&gt; will contact the Nerevarine at &lt;a href=\"Assurdirapal\"&gt;Assurdirapal&lt;/a&gt; with a simple task. &lt;a href=\"Oreyn%20Bearclaw\"&gt;Oreyn Bearclaw&lt;/a&gt;, a famed hero of elven ancestry is revealed (by Malacath) as a liar and the Nerevarine is tasked with killing the last member of his bloodline, &lt;a href=\"Farvyn%20Oreyn\"&gt;Farvyn Oreyn&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe Nerevarine is rewarded with the &lt;a href=\"Helm%20of%20Oreyn%20Bearclaw%20%28Morrowind%29\"&gt;Helm of Oreyn Bearclaw&lt;/a&gt; as a reward for ending the lie that Bearclaw (and his bloodline) spread.\n&lt;a href=\"Mehrunes%20Dagon%27s%20Quest\"&gt;Mehrunes Dagon's Quest&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe Daedric Prince of Destruction, &lt;a href=\"Mehrunes%20Dagon\"&gt;Mehrunes Dagon&lt;/a&gt;, has a seemingly simple task for the Nerevarine when he contacts them at &lt;a href=\"Yasammidan%20%28Morrowind%29\"&gt;Yasammidan&lt;/a&gt;. His artifact, &lt;a href=\"Mehrunes%27%20Razor%20%28Morrowind%29\"&gt;Mehrunes' Razor&lt;/a&gt;, must be retrieved and re-blessed by the Daedric Prince in order to bring back an element of Dagon's power to Vvardenfell. As a reward the Nerevarine may keep (and use) Mehrunes' Razor.\n&lt;a href=\"Mephala%27s%20Quest\"&gt;Mephala's Quest&lt;/a&gt;.\n&lt;a href=\"Mephala\"&gt;Mephala&lt;/a&gt; can be contacted by the Nerevarine in a hidden area of the &lt;a href=\"Arena%20Canton%20%28Morrowind%29\"&gt;Arena Canton&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Vivec%20City%20%28Morrowind%29\"&gt;Vivec City&lt;/a&gt;.

The Nerevarine must discretely place the poison in Omavel's cauldron before returning to Mephala. As a reward she will grant the Nerevarine the &lt;a href=\"Ring%20of%20Khajiit%20%28Morrowind%29\"&gt;Ring of Khajiit&lt;/a&gt; for removing the \"free agent\" in the Morag Tong.\n&lt;a href=\"Molag%20Bal%27s%20Quest\"&gt;Molag Bal's Quest&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe ruins of &lt;a href=\"Yansirramus%20%28Morrowind%29\"&gt;Yansirramus&lt;/a&gt; hold a shrine dedicated to &lt;a href=\"Molag%20Bal\"&gt;Molag Bal&lt;/a&gt;.

The task is to hunt down and kill her champion, at &lt;a href=\"Knifepoint%20Ridge\"&gt;Knifepoint Ridge&lt;/a&gt;, taking the Ebony Mail from him and wearing it, thus making the Dragonborn her new champion.\nLevel Requirement: Level 30\n&lt;a href=\"Clavicus%20Vile\"&gt;Clavicus Vile&lt;/a&gt;: &lt;a href=\"A%20Daedra%27s%20Best%20Friend\"&gt;A Daedra's Best Friend&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe quest begins in &lt;a href=\"Falkreath%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Falkreath&lt;/a&gt; after acquiring the task of luring out a &lt;a href=\"Dog%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;stray dog&lt;/a&gt; the &lt;a href=\"Lod\"&gt;blacksmith&lt;/a&gt; is interested in. Upon finding &lt;a href=\"Barbas%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;the dog&lt;/a&gt;, to the Dragonborn's surprise, it speaks.\nThe dog, named Barbas, then requests the Dragonborn help him reunite with his master, leading the Dragonborn to &lt;a href=\"Clavicus%20Vile%27s%20Shrine\"&gt;Clavicus Vile's Shrine&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Haemar%27s%20Shame\"&gt;Haemar's Shame&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href=\"Clavicus%20Vile\"&gt;Clavicus&lt;/a&gt; agrees to take back Barbas, if the Dragonborn collects the Rueful Axe from &lt;a href=\"Rimerock%20Burrow\"&gt;Rimerock Burrow&lt;/a&gt; for him.\nAfter acquiring the axe, he offers a deal: to let the Dragonborn keep the axe if the Dragonborn kills Barbas with it. If the Dragonborn chooses not to kill Barbas, they will receive the Masque of Clavicus Vile instead. The &lt;a href=\"Masque%20of%20Clavicus%20Vile%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Masque of Clavicus Vile&lt;/a&gt; is a &lt;a href=\"Heavy%20Armor%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Heavy Armor&lt;/a&gt; helmet, which is given by Clavicus Vile after returning the &lt;a href=\"Rueful%20Axe\"&gt;Rueful Axe&lt;/a&gt;.\nNote: The Rueful Axe does \"not\" count as Vile's &lt;a href=\"Daedric%20Artifacts%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Daedric artifact&lt;/a&gt;.\nNote: It is possible to obtain both items through a complex use of the slow time shout and weapon racks.\nLevel Requirement: Level 10\n&lt;a href=\"Hermaeus%20Mora\"&gt;Hermaeus Mora&lt;/a&gt;: &lt;a href=\"Discerning%20the%20Transmundane\"&gt;Discerning the Transmundane&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe quest \"&lt;a href=\"Discerning%20the%20Transmundane\"&gt;Discerning the Transmundane&lt;/a&gt;\" awards the Dragonborn with the &lt;a href=\"Skill%20Books%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Skill Book&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"Oghma%20Infinium%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Oghma Infinium&lt;/a&gt;.\nThis quest is automatically begun during the main quest, when searching for the Blackreach Elder Scroll. To begin this quest, the Dragonborn must go to &lt;a href=\"Septimus%20Signus%27%20Outpost\"&gt;Septimus Signus' Outpost&lt;/a&gt; and meet &lt;a href=\"Septimus%20Signus\"&gt;Septimus Signus&lt;/a&gt;. After recovering the Elder Scroll and inscribing the &lt;a href=\"Lexicon\"&gt;Lexicon&lt;/a&gt; for Signus, he will decode it, then give the Dragonborn the &lt;a href=\"Essence%20Extractor\"&gt;Essence Extractor&lt;/a&gt;. This must be used to gain samples of the blood of the &lt;a href=\"Falmer%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Falmer&lt;/a&gt; (Snow Elf), &lt;a href=\"Bosmer%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Bosmer&lt;/a&gt; (Wood Elf), &lt;a href=\"Dunmer%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Dunmer&lt;/a&gt; (Dark Elf), &lt;a href=\"Altmer%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Altmer&lt;/a&gt; (High Elf), and &lt;a href=\"Orsimer%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Orsimer&lt;/a&gt; (Orc).\nHowever, one cannot collect blood from those who suffer from &lt;a href=\"Vampirism%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;vampirism&lt;/a&gt;, even if they are the correct race. Upon doing this, return to Septimus, who will unlock the &lt;a href=\"Dwemer%20Artifacts\"&gt;Dwemer lockbox&lt;/a&gt; to reveal the Oghma Infinium. Upon the book being revealed, Septimus will try to take it and is immediately disintegrated by &lt;a href=\"Hermaeus%20Mora\"&gt;Hermaeus Mora&lt;/a&gt;, who then allows the Dragonborn to take the Oghma Infinium. It allows the Dragonborn to choose to increase all of the Mage, Thief, or Warrior skills by 5 points each.\nLevel Requirement: Level 15\n&lt;a href=\"Hircine\"&gt;Hircine&lt;/a&gt;: &lt;a href=\"Ill%20Met%20by%20Moonlight\"&gt;Ill Met by Moonlight&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe quest \"&lt;a href=\"Ill%20Met%20by%20Moonlight\"&gt;Ill Met by Moonlight&lt;/a&gt;\" awards the Dragonborn with either the &lt;a href=\"Savior%27s%20Hide%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Savior's Hide&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"Hircine%27s%20Ring%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Ring of Hircine&lt;/a&gt; (or both). To begin this quest the Dragonborn must travel to the jail underneath the &lt;a href=\"Falkreath%20Barracks\"&gt;Falkreath Barracks&lt;/a&gt; and speak to &lt;a href=\"Sinding\"&gt;Sinding&lt;/a&gt;. He will give the Dragonborn the &lt;a href=\"Hircine%27s%20Ring%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Cursed Ring of Hircine&lt;/a&gt;. He tells the Dragonborn that the beast in the woods must be killed. The beast is revealed to be the &lt;a href=\"Aspect%20of%20Hircine\"&gt;Aspect of Hircine&lt;/a&gt;, who then tells the Dragonborn they must go to &lt;a href=\"Bloated%20Man%27s%20Grotto\"&gt;Bloated Man's Grotto&lt;/a&gt; and choose to either kill Sinding for the Hide or spare him for the Ring.\nLevel Requirement: None\nNote: It is possible to obtain both items by using a number of different exploits.\n&lt;a href=\"Malacath\"&gt;Malacath&lt;/a&gt;: &lt;a href=\"The%20Cursed%20Tribe\"&gt;The Cursed Tribe&lt;/a&gt;.\nTo obtain &lt;a href=\"Volendrung%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Volendrung&lt;/a&gt; the Dragonborn needs to approach the &lt;a href=\"Orsimer%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;orc&lt;/a&gt; stronghold &lt;a href=\"Largashbur\"&gt;Largashbur&lt;/a&gt;. There, a female Orc, &lt;a href=\"Atub\"&gt;Atub&lt;/a&gt;, requests assistance with lifting a curse from the settlement. She requires a Daedra Heart and Troll Fat to summon Malacath.\nAfter contacting &lt;a href=\"Malacath\"&gt;Malacath&lt;/a&gt;, the Dragonborn and &lt;a href=\"Chief%20Yamarz\"&gt;Chief Yamarz&lt;/a&gt; are sent to &lt;a href=\"Giant%27s%20Grove\"&gt;Giant's Grove&lt;/a&gt; (via &lt;a href=\"Fallowstone%20Cave\"&gt;Fallowstone Cave&lt;/a&gt;) to retrieve &lt;a href=\"Shagrol%27s%20Warhammer\"&gt;Shagrol's Warhammer&lt;/a&gt;.\nLevel Requirement: Level 9\n&lt;a href=\"Mehrunes%20Dagon\"&gt;Mehrunes Dagon&lt;/a&gt;: &lt;a href=\"Pieces%20of%20the%20Past\"&gt;Pieces of the Past&lt;/a&gt;.\n&lt;a href=\"Mehrunes%27%20Razor%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Mehrunes' Razor&lt;/a&gt; is the dagger from Oblivion that was previously used by the &lt;a href=\"Mythic%20Dawn\"&gt;Mythic Dawn&lt;/a&gt;. It can be obtained by completing a simple chain quest. The first part of the quest involves visiting with a descendant of the assassins of &lt;a href=\"Uriel%20Septim%20VII\"&gt;Uriel Septim VII&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Silus\"&gt;Silus&lt;/a&gt;, who runs a small museum dedicated to the Mythic Dawn in &lt;a href=\"Dawnstar%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Dawnstar&lt;/a&gt;. It holds several items from : \"&lt;a href=\"Commentaries%20on%20the%20Mysterium%20Xarxes\"&gt;Commentaries on the Mysterium Xarxes&lt;/a&gt;\" by &lt;a href=\"Mankar%20Camoran%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;Mankar Camoran&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Mythic%20Dawn%20Robes%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Mythic Dawn robes&lt;/a&gt;, the sheath to the Razor, and the first page from the \"&lt;a href=\"Mysterium%20Xarxes\"&gt;Mysterium Xarxes&lt;/a&gt;\". The first portion of the quest directs the Dragonborn to gather the pieces of Mehrunes' Razor. After that, the Dragonborn must then meet Silus at the &lt;a href=\"Shrine%20of%20Mehrunes%20Dagon\"&gt;Shrine of Mehrunes Dagon&lt;/a&gt;, speak to &lt;a href=\"Mehrunes%20Dagon\"&gt;Mehrunes Dagon&lt;/a&gt; himself, and kill Silus to complete the quest and earn the reward.\nLevel Requirement: Level 20\n&lt;a href=\"Mephala\"&gt;Mephala&lt;/a&gt;: &lt;a href=\"The%20Whispering%20Door\"&gt;The Whispering Door&lt;/a&gt;.\nAsking &lt;a href=\"Hulda\"&gt;Hulda&lt;/a&gt; the bartender at &lt;a href=\"The%20Bannered%20Mare\"&gt;The Bannered Mare&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Whiterun%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Whiterun&lt;/a&gt; about rumors turns up gossip about &lt;a href=\"Balgruuf%20the%20Greater\"&gt;Jarl Balgruuf's&lt;/a&gt; son, &lt;a href=\"Nelkir\"&gt;Nelkir&lt;/a&gt;. Talking to the Jarl reveals that Nelkir is troubled and he asks the Dragonborn to speak to him. Nelkir explains that a door in the basement is telling him secrets. Going to the door, a voice orders the Dragonborn to open it. Nelkir will explain that the Jarl and &lt;a href=\"Farengar%20Secret-Fire\"&gt;Farengar Secret-Fire&lt;/a&gt; are the only people who have keys. The Dragonborn must pickpocket the key from one of them (or kill Farengar and loot the key off his corpse) in order to gain entrance to the door. Inside they will find an &lt;a href=\"Ebony%20Blade%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Ebony Blade&lt;/a&gt;, along with a book providing a warning to whoever uses the weapon.\nThe quest then completes. &lt;a href=\"Mephala\"&gt;Mephala&lt;/a&gt; will explain, however, that the weapon needs to be recharged with the 'Blood of Deceit' in order to increase its power. This will require the Dragonborn to kill friendly characters\u2014for every two characters killed by the Dragonborn, the weapon increases in power, adding 4 to the strength of the &lt;a href=\"Absorb%20Health%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Absorb Health&lt;/a&gt; effect (up to the maximum of 30); killing 10 friendly characters will max out the strength of the Absorb Health &lt;a href=\"Enchanting%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Enchantment&lt;/a&gt;.\nLevel Requirement: Level 20, completion of main quest \"&lt;a href=\"Dragon%20Rising\"&gt;Dragon Rising&lt;/a&gt;.\"\n&lt;a href=\"Meridia\"&gt;Meridia&lt;/a&gt;: &lt;a href=\"The%20Break%20of%20Dawn\"&gt;The Break of Dawn&lt;/a&gt;.\n&lt;a href=\"Dawnbreaker%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Dawnbreaker&lt;/a&gt;, a one-handed enchanted sword, can be obtained by speaking to &lt;a href=\"Meridia\"&gt;Meridia&lt;/a&gt; at the &lt;a href=\"Statue%20to%20Meridia\"&gt;Statue to Meridia&lt;/a&gt; and completing her quest. This is a simple quest that requires the Dragonborn to find her &lt;a href=\"Meridia%27s%20Beacon\"&gt;beacon&lt;/a&gt; (usually found in random dungeons), and then to \"lead Meridia's light\" through the dungeon underneath her Shrine. In order to do this, the Dragonborn must activate pedestals with glowing balls of light in sequence throughout the dungeon.\nThe dungeon itself is filled with &lt;a href=\"Draugr%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Draugr&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Corrupted%20Shade%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Corrupted Shades&lt;/a&gt;, and is somewhat complicated to navigate. At the end the Dragonborn will have to defeat a powerful &lt;a href=\"Necromancer%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;necromancer&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Malkoran\"&gt;Malkoran&lt;/a&gt;, who apparently is defiling her Shrine. Upon defeating him, the Dragonborn will be granted the sword, Dawnbreaker, and receive Meridia's blessing.\nLevel Requirement: Level 12\n&lt;a href=\"Molag%20Bal\"&gt;Molag Bal&lt;/a&gt;: &lt;a href=\"The%20House%20of%20Horrors\"&gt;The House of Horrors&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Mace%20of%20Molag%20Bal%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Mace of Molag Bal&lt;/a&gt; can be found in the city of &lt;a href=\"Markarth%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Markarth&lt;/a&gt;. Once walking through the main gate, outside of the \"Abandoned House,\" a &lt;a href=\"Vigilant%20of%20Stendarr\"&gt;Vigilant of Stendarr&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Vigilant%20Tyranus\"&gt;Vigilant Tyranus&lt;/a&gt;, will ask the Dragonborn if they have seen anyone entering or leaving. Going through the conversation will trigger the quest \"&lt;a href=\"The%20House%20of%20Horrors\"&gt;The House of Horrors&lt;/a&gt;.\" Enter the house, then find the small shrine containing the Rusty Mace (Mace of Molag Bal). The shrine will speak, commanding the Dragonborn to find &lt;a href=\"Logrolf%20the%20Willful\"&gt;Logrolf the Willful&lt;/a&gt;, a priest of Boethiah who has been captured by the &lt;a href=\"Forsworn\"&gt;Forsworn&lt;/a&gt;. Once the Dragonborn returns to the shrine with the priest, the shrine will speak again. The Dragonborn will be required to slay the priest with the Mace of Molag Bal. Once this is completed, the Dragonborn will be allowed to keep the mace.\nLevel Requirement: None\n&lt;a href=\"Namira\"&gt;Namira&lt;/a&gt;: &lt;a href=\"The%20Taste%20of%20Death\"&gt;The Taste of Death&lt;/a&gt;.\nTo begin the quest, the Dragonborn must go to the bartender in the &lt;a href=\"Silver-Blood%20Inn\"&gt;Silver-Blood Inn&lt;/a&gt; or talk to &lt;a href=\"Brother%20Verulus\"&gt;Brother Verulus&lt;/a&gt; at the &lt;a href=\"Understone%20Keep%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Understone Keep&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Hall%20of%20the%20Dead%20%28Markarth%29\"&gt;Hall of the Dead&lt;/a&gt; entrance. Something has been eating the dead and he needs someone to investigate. Verulus will give the Dragonborn a key. The Dragonborn will then meet &lt;a href=\"Eola\"&gt;Eola&lt;/a&gt; in the Hall of the Dead in &lt;a href=\"Markarth%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Markarth&lt;/a&gt;, where she will accuse them of being a cannibal. She then asks the Dragonborn to meet her at &lt;a href=\"Reachcliff%20Cave\"&gt;Reachcliff Cave&lt;/a&gt;, where they will have to clear the cave of Draugr.\nAfterwards, Eola will ask the Dragonborn to bring Brother Verulus from Markarth to the shrine. Once there, the Dragonborn must kill Verulus and eat his flesh. Namira will then speak to the Dragonborn and grant them her ring. The &lt;a href=\"Ring%20of%20Namira%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Ring of Namira&lt;/a&gt; grants the user with 50 extra points of &lt;a href=\"Stamina%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Stamina&lt;/a&gt; and feeding on corpses grants a bonus to &lt;a href=\"Health%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;health&lt;/a&gt; regeneration. Eola becomes available as a &lt;a href=\"Followers%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;follower&lt;/a&gt; after the quest.\nLevel Requirement: None\n&lt;a href=\"Peryite\"&gt;Peryite&lt;/a&gt;: &lt;a href=\"The%20Only%20Cure\"&gt;The Only Cure&lt;/a&gt;.\nUpon finding the shrine, Northeast of Markarth, the Dragonborn should speak to &lt;a href=\"Kesh%20the%20Clean\"&gt;Kesh the Clean&lt;/a&gt; to begin the quest. He will offer to let the Dragonborn commune with Peryite. If the Dragonborn accepts, Kesh will ask for a &lt;a href=\"silver%20ingot\"&gt;silver ingot&lt;/a&gt;, a &lt;a href=\"Deathbell%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Deathbell&lt;/a&gt; flower, &lt;a href=\"Vampire%20Dust%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Vampire Dust&lt;/a&gt; and a &lt;a href=\"Flawless%20Ruby\"&gt;Flawless Ruby&lt;/a&gt; to make a special sort of incense. Once these items have been obtained, the Dragonborn should talk to Kesh again to have him make the incense. The Dragonborn will inhale the incense and begin talking to Peryite. He will ask for the Dragonborn to travel to &lt;a href=\"Bthardamz%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Bthardamz&lt;/a&gt; and kill an elf named &lt;a href=\"Orchendor\"&gt;Orchendor&lt;/a&gt;. After he is slain, the Dragonborn can return to Peryite and claim &lt;a href=\"Spellbreaker%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Spellbreaker&lt;/a&gt;.\nLevel Requirement: Level 10 to get the quest from the Afflicted, or 12 to get the quest from Kesh.\n&lt;a href=\"Sanguine\"&gt;Sanguine&lt;/a&gt;: &lt;a href=\"A%20Night%20to%20Remember%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;A Night to Remember&lt;/a&gt;.\nThis quest can be prompted by entering a drinking contest with a mage named &lt;a href=\"Sam%20Guevenne\"&gt;Sam Guevenne&lt;/a&gt; in the nearest tavern upon reaching level 14. Upon finishing the Drinking Contest the Dragonborn will black out, and awaken in &lt;a href=\"Markarth%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Markarth&lt;/a&gt;'s &lt;a href=\"Temple%20of%20Dibella\"&gt;Temple of Dibella&lt;/a&gt;. However, the Dragonborn has to find or get approached by certain people in the game in order to piece together exactly what happened as a result of the contest. At the end of the chain of events, the Dragonborn ends up in the castle of Morvunskar, where they find a portal. Going through the portal transports them to a festive scene, where Sanguine approaches them and rewards them with the &lt;a href=\"Sanguine%20Rose%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Sanguine Rose&lt;/a&gt;, which is a staff that summons a leveled &lt;a href=\"Dremora%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Dremora&lt;/a&gt; for 60 seconds.\nLevel Requirement: Level 14\n&lt;a href=\"Sheogorath\"&gt;Sheogorath&lt;/a&gt;: &lt;a href=\"The%20Mind%20of%20Madness\"&gt;The Mind of Madness&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Wabbajack%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Wabbajack&lt;/a&gt; is a staff, given by the Daedric Prince of madness, &lt;a href=\"Sheogorath\"&gt;Sheogorath&lt;/a&gt;. \"&lt;a href=\"The%20Mind%20of%20Madness\"&gt;The Mind of Madness&lt;/a&gt;\" quest is started in &lt;a href=\"Solitude%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Solitude&lt;/a&gt; when talking to an apparently insane homeless man, named &lt;a href=\"Dervenin%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Dervenin&lt;/a&gt;, who claims his master is on vacation in the Pelagius wing of the castle. If the Dragonborn cannot find Dervenin, they can go to &lt;a href=\"The%20Winking%20Skeever\"&gt;The Winking Skeever&lt;/a&gt; and ask the Bartender if he has heard any rumors. He will then tell about a strange old man walking around Solitude.\nWhen the Dragonborn investigates, they are transported inside the mind of the mad king &lt;a href=\"Pelagius%20Septim%20III\"&gt;Pelagius&lt;/a&gt;. There, they find Sheogorath, who offers the Dragonborn a bargain: escape Pelagius' mind, and he will return. Upon completion of the quest, he rewards the Dragonborn with the Wabbajack, a staff that when used transforms the target into another creature, summons a minor creature to attack the enemy, summons a lightning cloud, turns the enemy into coins, and more.\nLevel Requirement: None\n&lt;a href=\"Vaermina\"&gt;Vaermina&lt;/a&gt;: &lt;a href=\"Waking%20Nightmare\"&gt;Waking Nightmare&lt;/a&gt;.\nSpeaking to &lt;a href=\"Erandur\"&gt;Erandur&lt;/a&gt;, a follower of &lt;a href=\"Mara\"&gt;Mara&lt;/a&gt;, in the &lt;a href=\"Windpeak%20Inn\"&gt;Windpeak Inn&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Dawnstar%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Dawnstar&lt;/a&gt; will begin a quest to end the nightmares. &lt;a href=\"Waking%20Nightmare\"&gt;Waking Nightmare&lt;/a&gt; involves a visit to the &lt;a href=\"Nightcaller%20Temple\"&gt;Nightcaller Temple&lt;/a&gt;.\nAfter following all the quest updates, the Dragonborn will reach the end scene, as Erandur casts a spell to destroy the &lt;a href=\"Skull%20of%20Corruption%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Skull of Corruption&lt;/a&gt;, a Daedric weapon which has been causing the nightmares.\nThe Dragonborn can kill Erandur as &lt;a href=\"Vaermina\"&gt;Vaermina&lt;/a&gt; commands and take the Skull as a reward, or let him complete his spell to destroy the Skull. In the latter case, he can become a follower. If the Skull is destroyed, however, Vaermina's Daedric artifact cannot be retrieved.\nLevel Requirement: None"}

Visiting this shrine does not begin the related Daedric quest, \"&lt;a href=\"A%20Daedra%27s%20Best%20Friend\"&gt;A Daedra's Best Friend&lt;/a&gt;.\"\nUpon completion of the quest, &lt;a href=\"Barbas%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Barbas&lt;/a&gt; becomes part of the Clavicus Vile statue.\nStatue of Hermaeus Mora.\nWhile &lt;a href=\"Hermaeus%20Mora%20%28Dragonborn%29\"&gt;Hermaeus Mora&lt;/a&gt; does not have a shrine or altar in the base game, a statue of him can be found in the depths of the &lt;a href=\"Temple%20of%20Miraak\"&gt;Temple of Miraak&lt;/a&gt; on Solstheim, visited during the \"Dragonborn\" main questline. The &lt;a href=\"Last%20Dragonborn\"&gt;Dragonborn&lt;/a&gt; cannot interact with the statue.\nAltars of Hircine.\nAn altar dedicated to &lt;a href=\"Hircine\"&gt;Hircine&lt;/a&gt; can be found within &lt;a href=\"Glenmoril%20Coven%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Glenmoril Coven&lt;/a&gt;, which is usually visited as part of the Companions quest \"&lt;a href=\"Blood%27s%20Honor\"&gt;Blood's Honor&lt;/a&gt;,\" but it cannot be interacted with. Hircine's quest is instead started by talking to &lt;a href=\"Sinding\"&gt;Sinding&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Falkreath%20Jail\"&gt;Falkreath Jail&lt;/a&gt;.\nAnother altar can be found on &lt;a href=\"Solstheim%20%28Dragonborn%29\"&gt;Solstheim&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;a href=\"Snowclad%20Ruins\"&gt;Snowclad Ruins&lt;/a&gt;. It is protected by three &lt;a href=\"Werebear%20%28Dragonborn%29\"&gt;werebears&lt;/a&gt;, but also offers no interactions.\nShrine of Malacath.\nA defiled shrine to &lt;a href=\"Malacath\"&gt;Malacath&lt;/a&gt; is located in &lt;a href=\"Giant%27s%20Grove\"&gt;Giant's Grove&lt;/a&gt;. Visiting this shrine is not possible until \"&lt;a href=\"The%20Cursed%20Tribe\"&gt;The Cursed Tribe&lt;/a&gt;\" quest has begun.\n&lt;a href=\"Shrine%20of%20Mehrunes%20Dagon\"&gt;Shrine of Mehrunes Dagon&lt;/a&gt;.\nThis shrine is southwest of &lt;a href=\"Dawnstar%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Dawnstar&lt;/a&gt;, on a mountain. It can be found by traveling to &lt;a href=\"Fort%20Dunstad\"&gt;Fort Dunstad&lt;/a&gt; and climbing the mountain which leads to an area behind the shrine. Visiting this shrine does not begin the related Daedric quest, \"&lt;a href=\"Pieces%20of%20the%20Past\"&gt;Pieces of the Past&lt;/a&gt;.\"\nThe interior of the shrine contains some valuable loot, but is guarded by a pair of &lt;a href=\"Dremora%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Dremora&lt;/a&gt; and can only be accessed upon completion of said quest. It has ores and ingots, along with gold and weapons that are enchanted.\n&lt;a href=\"Shrine%20of%20Mephala\"&gt;Shrine of Mephala&lt;/a&gt;.\n&lt;a href=\"Mephala\"&gt;Mephala&lt;/a&gt;'s shrine can be found in the Temple of Raven Rock, where she is worshipped as part of the Reclamations. By praying at the Shrine, one receives the &lt;a href=\"Blessing%20of%20Mephala\"&gt;Blessing of Mephala&lt;/a&gt;.\n&lt;a href=\"Statue%20to%20Meridia\"&gt;Statue to Meridia&lt;/a&gt;.\nThis shrine is located in the mountains due west of &lt;a href=\"Solitude%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Solitude&lt;/a&gt;. Visiting the shrine begins the quest \"&lt;a href=\"The%20Break%20of%20Dawn\"&gt;The Break of Dawn&lt;/a&gt;.\" Upon completion of the quest, &lt;a href=\"Meridia\"&gt;Meridia&lt;/a&gt; grants the Dragonborn the &lt;a href=\"Dawnbreaker%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Dawnbreaker&lt;/a&gt;.\nAlternatively, &lt;a href=\"Meridia%27s%20Beacon\"&gt;Meridia's Beacon&lt;/a&gt; can be found inside a chest as random loot. Upon picking it up, the quest appears in the journal, and the location of the Statue will be marked as a Quest Location. Going there and activating the shrine starts the real quest.\n&lt;a href=\"Altar%20of%20Molag%20Bal\"&gt;Altar of Molag Bal&lt;/a&gt;.\nNot as grand in scale as the other shrines, the Altar of Molag Bal is located underneath the &lt;a href=\"Abandoned%20House%20%28Markarth%29\"&gt;Abandoned House&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Markarth%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Markarth&lt;/a&gt;. Visiting the altar is only possible after initiating the quest \"&lt;a href=\"The%20House%20of%20Horrors\"&gt;The House of Horrors&lt;/a&gt;.\"\nWith the addition of another shrine can be found in the chapel of &lt;a href=\"Castle%20Volkihar\"&gt;Castle Volkihar&lt;/a&gt;. During the quest \"&lt;a href=\"Kindred%20Judgment\"&gt;Kindred Judgment&lt;/a&gt;,\" Lord &lt;a href=\"Harkon\"&gt;Harkon&lt;/a&gt; will use this shrine to empower himself, but it cannot otherwise be interacted with.\nAltar of Namira.\nA small altar dedicated to &lt;a href=\"Namira\"&gt;Namira&lt;/a&gt; can be found in &lt;a href=\"Reachcliff%20Cave\"&gt;Reachcliff Cave&lt;/a&gt;, where several members of her coven use it to sacrifice people. This shrine is encountered during the Daedric quest \"&lt;a href=\"The%20Taste%20of%20Death\"&gt;The Taste of Death&lt;/a&gt;.\"\n&lt;a href=\"Shrine%20of%20Nocturnal%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Shrine of Nocturnal&lt;/a&gt;.\nThere are two shrines located in Skyrim dedicated to Nocturnal. One in the &lt;a href=\"Twilight%20Sepulcher\"&gt;Twilight Sepulcher&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Falkreath%20Hold%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Falkreath Hold&lt;/a&gt;, during the quest \"&lt;a href=\"Darkness%20Returns\"&gt;Darkness Returns&lt;/a&gt;\" and one in the &lt;a href=\"The%20Ragged%20Flagon%20-%20Cistern\"&gt;The Ragged Flagon - Cistern&lt;/a&gt;, in &lt;a href=\"Riften%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Riften&lt;/a&gt;, after completing the quest\u00a0\"Darkness Returns.\" Both can be prayed at to receive the &lt;a href=\"Blessing%20of%20Nocturnal\"&gt;Blessing of Nocturnal&lt;/a&gt;.\n&lt;a href=\"Shrine%20to%20Peryite\"&gt;Shrine to Peryite&lt;/a&gt;.\nThis shrine is located in &lt;a href=\"The%20Reach\"&gt;The Reach&lt;/a&gt;, far to the northeast of &lt;a href=\"Markarth%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Markarth&lt;/a&gt;. Visiting the shrine begins the quest \"&lt;a href=\"The%20Only%20Cure\"&gt;The Only Cure&lt;/a&gt;.\"\nAltar of Vaermina.\nVarious altars dedicated to &lt;a href=\"Vaermina\"&gt;Vaermina&lt;/a&gt; can be found in &lt;a href=\"Nightcaller%20Temple\"&gt;Nightcaller Temple&lt;/a&gt;, where a small cult was established at one time, before it was sacked by &lt;a href=\"Orsimer%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Orcish&lt;/a&gt; invaders. These\u00a0altars\u00a0are encountered during the Daedric quest \"&lt;a href=\"Waking%20Nightmare\"&gt;Waking Nightmare&lt;/a&gt;.\""}

Its primary tool was a drill powerful enough to flatten a city's gates, though it could also use fireballs to annihilate smaller targets such as soldiers.\nFirst usage.\nThe Siege Crawler was first used at the &lt;a href=\"Battle%20of%20Kvatch\"&gt;Battle of Kvatch&lt;/a&gt;, in which it crushed the city's defenses, allowing the Lesser Daedra to pour through and slaughter the towns-people. It was later used again during the Second Battle of Bruma in an attempt to demolish the city. Fortunately, the &lt;a href=\"Hero%20of%20Kvatch\"&gt;Hero&lt;/a&gt; managed to enter the realm of &lt;a href=\"Oblivion%20%28Realm%29\"&gt;Oblivion&lt;/a&gt; it was located in, took the &lt;a href=\"Great%20Sigil%20Stone%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;Great Sigil Stone&lt;/a&gt;, and brought it down before it could reach the city's main gate.\nA notable fact is that since the Siege Crawler is powered by a &lt;a href=\"Sigil%20Stone%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;Sigil Stone&lt;/a&gt;, when it collapses at Bruma this Sigil Stone falls out of place, and can be picked up by the Hero.

He was set a place of honor in the nethermost depths of the &lt;a href=\"Tower%20of%20Lies\"&gt;Tower of Lies&lt;/a&gt;, for Molag Bal desired the secrets of the dov's dominance over the mortals. Long was Boziikkodstrun tortured, but uttered not a single sentence. Tired with this, Molag Bal began to slowly consume the dragon's flesh until there was but a skeleton. There, Molag Bal said, \"If I cannot have the secrets of the dragons, then I shall make dragons of my own, dragons even mightier than those of Nirn!\"\nMolag Bal then had the skeleton taken to the &lt;a href=\"Vile%20Laboratory\"&gt;Vile Laboratory&lt;/a&gt;, where it was infused with the blood of darkness, reviving it as a soulless being. He then had the skeleton improved, forming a bone frame even mightier than its forebears.

After that, the first Daedric Titan rose from the chasm to serve its master."}

Daenia contains both the cities of &lt;a href=\"Daggerfall\"&gt;Daggerfall&lt;/a&gt; and Daenia City. Daenia is known as the home of the &lt;a href=\"Beldama%20Wyrd\"&gt;Beldama Wyrd&lt;/a&gt;, a group of Breton-witches that safeguard the forest, all the while worshipping the &lt;a href=\"Ehlnofey\"&gt;Ehlnofey&lt;/a&gt; known as the &lt;a href=\"Elemental%20Guardians\"&gt;Elemental Guardians&lt;/a&gt;.\nDescription.\nGeography.\nDaenia makes up the westernmost portion of High Rock and the region of Glenumbra. But this is regarding geography. Politically, the Duchy of Daenia is in the north-central portion of the &lt;a href=\"Iliac%20Bay\"&gt;Iliac Bay&lt;/a&gt;, between several nations, including the &lt;a href=\"Fiefdom%20of%20Anticlere\"&gt;Fiefdom of Anticlere&lt;/a&gt; in the south, the &lt;a href=\"Fiefdom%20of%20Ykalon\"&gt;Fiefdom of Ykalon&lt;/a&gt; to the north, and the &lt;a href=\"Barony%20of%20the%20Ilessan%20Hills\"&gt;Barony of the Ilessan Hills&lt;/a&gt; in the west. Daenia's land is engulfed in an endless sea of forest, being a part of the much larger forest that encompasses most of Iliac-High Rock. But deep in Daenia's forest lies the &lt;a href=\"Beldama%20Wyrd%20Tree\"&gt;Beldama Wyrd Tree&lt;/a&gt;, one of the largest trees in Tamriel. It is the home of the &lt;a href=\"Beldama%20Wyrd\"&gt;Beldama Wyrd&lt;/a&gt;, a group of witches that safeguard the forest and the creatures that inhabit it. Much of the inner forest is uninhabited, riddled with ruins entangled by vines, and rundown shacks in clearings. The city-state of &lt;a href=\"Daggerfall\"&gt;Daggerfall&lt;/a&gt; is situated on the western end of the forest, overlooking the &lt;a href=\"Sea%20of%20Pearls\"&gt;Sea of Pearls&lt;/a&gt; in the west, and the Iliac Bay in the south. The capital of the Duchy is the city-state of &lt;a href=\"Daenia%20%28City%29\"&gt;Daenia&lt;/a&gt;, which is in the central north of the Duchy. Throughout the land are minor settlements that pay homage to Daenia City, such as &lt;a href=\"Graybrone%20Court\"&gt;Graybrone Court&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Westtry\"&gt;Westtry&lt;/a&gt;. By the time the &lt;a href=\"Warp%20in%20the%20West\"&gt;Warp in the West&lt;/a&gt; had occurred, the Duchy of Daenia was absorbed into the Kingdom of Daggerfall.\nHistory.\n&lt;a href=\"Second%20Era\"&gt;Second Era&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe Bloodthorn Cult &amp; Murders in Daggerfall.\nDuring the &lt;a href=\"Interregnum\"&gt;Interregnum&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"2E%20582\"&gt;2E 582&lt;/a&gt;, the city-state of Daggerfall was ruled by &lt;a href=\"King%20Casimir\"&gt;King Casimir Deleyn&lt;/a&gt;, whose kingdom was integrated into the &lt;a href=\"Daggerfall%20Covenant\"&gt;Daggerfall Covenant&lt;/a&gt;. A string of murders had occurred throughout Daggerfall's streets, leaving various citizens fearing for their lives. While &lt;a href=\"Captain%20Aresin\"&gt;Captain Aresin&lt;/a&gt; of the City Guard had begun his investigation, a &lt;a href=\"Vestige\"&gt;mysterious traveler&lt;/a&gt; had begun their own sleuthing, eventually rendezvousing with Captain Aresin near the local &lt;a href=\"Mages%20Guild\"&gt;Mages Guild&lt;/a&gt;. It was revealed that the &lt;a href=\"Bloodthorn%20Cult\"&gt;Bloodthorn Cult&lt;/a&gt;, a group of &lt;a href=\"Reachmen\"&gt;Reachmen&lt;/a&gt; had appeared in Daggerfall. Further investigation brought the traveler to &lt;a href=\"Martine%20Lerineaux\"&gt;Martine Lerineaux&lt;/a&gt;, a nobleman of Daggerfall and a conspirer of the Bloodthorn. The Reachmen plan to assassinate King Casimir, to begin their conquest over &lt;a href=\"Glenumbra\"&gt;Glenumbra&lt;/a&gt;. The Reachmen assassin, &lt;a href=\"Verrik\"&gt;Verrik&lt;/a&gt; led an assault on Castle Daggerfall, attempting to kill the King until he was stricken down by the traveler. This revealed the cult's plot against Glenumbra, and so the Beldama Wyrd were soon becoming involved.\nThe Beldama Wyrd &amp; the Corruption of the Tree.\nThe Bloodthorn had begun their sabotage in Daenia, causing unrest in the farming town of &lt;a href=\"Deleyn%27s%20Mill\"&gt;Deleyn's Mill&lt;/a&gt;. With the help of the Beldama Wyress, &lt;a href=\"Wyress%20Helene\"&gt;Helene&lt;/a&gt;, it was discovered that Reach magic had corrupted the forest and silenced the &lt;a href=\"Elemental%20Guardians\"&gt;Elemental Guardians&lt;/a&gt;, leading to the Beldama to cleanse the &lt;a href=\"Vale%20of%20the%20Guardians\"&gt;Vale of the Guardians&lt;/a&gt; of the vile magic. The Guardians were enchained, unable to speak with the Beldama and clean the forest. The traveler is directed to the &lt;a href=\"Beldama%20Wyrd%20Tree\"&gt;Beldama Wyrd Tree&lt;/a&gt;, in the northern valley of Daenia. It was there a &lt;a href=\"Corruption%20of%20the%20Tree\"&gt;Corruption of the Tree&lt;/a&gt; had dwelled in the Wyrd Tree, spreading the Reach magic throughout the region. The Beldama fought the Bloodthorn and destroyed corruptions of the elements. The traveler defeated the Corruption of the Tree, purifying the forest from the magic. All the while, an Army of &lt;a href=\"Werewolves\"&gt;Werewolves&lt;/a&gt;, under the command of &lt;a href=\"Faolchu%20the%20Reborn\"&gt;Faolchu the Reborn&lt;/a&gt; had invaded the city-state of &lt;a href=\"Camlorn\"&gt;Camlorn&lt;/a&gt; in the region of the &lt;a href=\"Cambray%20Hills\"&gt;Cambray Hills&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href=\"Duke%20Nathaniel\"&gt;Duke Nathaniel&lt;/a&gt; of Camlorn is sent to &lt;a href=\"Aldcroft\"&gt;Aldcroft&lt;/a&gt; with other refugees. The traveler leaves for Aldcroft.\n&lt;a href=\"Third%20Era\"&gt;Third Era&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe Tale of Darius Shano; The Importance of Madness.\nIn his lifetime, &lt;a href=\"Darius%20Shano\"&gt;Darius Shano&lt;/a&gt; was a well-renowned writer that lived in the Duchy of Daenia. Darius had unintentionally been a part of a wager between the &lt;a href=\"Daedric%20Prince\"&gt;Daedric Prince&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"Vaermina\"&gt;Vaermina&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Sheogorath\"&gt;Sheogorath&lt;/a&gt;, where one of them must make him the most hated figure, to the highest point possible. Vaermina imbedded nightmarish visions into Darius for several years, since he was nineteen until he was twenty-nine. During that time, Shano transcribed these nightmares, which garnered him polarizing attention, both revulsion, and fascination. When it Sheogorath's time had come, these horrific nightmares had ceased. His attention had wavered, the provocation he had once earned was none existence, and so he took it to higher levels, where he mocked and besmirched the name of the &lt;a href=\"Nine%20Divines\"&gt;Nine Divines&lt;/a&gt;. When he published his final book, which was on &lt;a href=\"Talos\"&gt;Talos&lt;/a&gt;, \"The Noblest Fool\", it had brought such shame to the King of Daenia, where he ordered for Shano's execution, in front of a crowd of cheering people.\" Vaermina had lost the wager because \"without madness, there are no dreams and no creation.\" This lesson was not forgotten by Vaermina.\nThe Duchy of Daenia in the Warp in the West.\nDuring the &lt;a href=\"Warp%20in%20the%20West\"&gt;Warp in the West&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"3E%20417\"&gt;3E 417&lt;/a&gt;, the Duchy of Daenia was under the reign of an unknown Duchess, whose name was lost in the history books. Daenia existed among the forty-four different nations of the &lt;a href=\"Iliac%20Bay\"&gt;Iliac Bay&lt;/a&gt;. Daenia itself is a mainland duchy not far from the &lt;a href=\"Kingdom%20of%20Daggerfall\"&gt;Kingdom of Daggerfall&lt;/a&gt;, one of the three major kingdoms of the Iliac Bay. Later in the same year, the Warp in the West had occurred, resulting in the Kingdoms expanding their territories, absorbing the smaller nations of the Iliac. The Fiefdom of Alcaire was annexed into the Kingdom of Daggerfall along with other nations throughout the western Iliac Coast. Because of its location, the Duchy of Daenia was the site of various battles between Daggerfall and Wayrest, where a massive forest fire had occurred, from Daenia, to &lt;a href=\"Phrygias\"&gt;Phrygias&lt;/a&gt;. In the end, Daggerfall prevailed and claimed Daenia."}

It is also the seat of power in the Kingdom of Daggerfall. Daggerfall is among the original Breton kingdoms, that rose to prominence in the aftermath of the Skyrim Conquests. Through antiquity, prosperity, and power, Daggerfall has become a major political power in the West.\nDescription.\nGeography.\nThe city of Daggerfall is the capital of the &lt;a href=\"Kingdom%20of%20Daggerfall\"&gt;Kingdom of Daggerfall&lt;/a&gt;, which is one of the larger nations of the &lt;a href=\"Iliac%20Bay\"&gt;Iliac Bay&lt;/a&gt;. The region is located on the western shores of the Bay, and is on the northern end of the Iliac Estuary, from the &lt;a href=\"Eltheric%20Ocean\"&gt;Eltheric Ocean&lt;/a&gt;. The Kingdom is bordered by several smaller regions including the &lt;a href=\"Barony%20of%20the%20Ilessan%20Hills\"&gt;Barony of the Ilessan Hills&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"March%20of%20Glenpoint\"&gt;March of Glenpoint&lt;/a&gt;, among other areas. Smaller settlements thrive in the Kingdom of Daggerfall, each depending on the capital city. These settlements include the townships of &lt;a href=\"Singmoth\"&gt;Singmoth&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Newwood%20Wood\"&gt;Newwood Wood&lt;/a&gt;. As time went on, the Kingdom of Daggerfall began to absorb other regions, from as far as the &lt;a href=\"Barony%20of%20Phrygias\"&gt;Barony of Phrygias&lt;/a&gt; to the &lt;a href=\"Barony%20of%20Glenumbra%20Moors\"&gt;Barony of Glenumbra Moors&lt;/a&gt;. The local deity of Daggerfall is the divine, &lt;a href=\"Kynareth\"&gt;Kynareth&lt;/a&gt;, who has the &lt;a href=\"Temple%20of%20Kynareth\"&gt;Temple of Kynareth&lt;/a&gt; worshipping them around the city. The local knightly order is the &lt;a href=\"Knights%20of%20the%20Dragon\"&gt;Knights of the Dragon&lt;/a&gt;, who have protected the Kingdom of Daggerfall for generations. The &lt;a href=\"Vraseth%20Clan\"&gt;Vraseth Vampire Clan&lt;/a&gt; are prominent in the region and other nations in the Iliac Bay.\nBecause Daggerfall is a somewhat significant city, it is one of the largest cities in the Iliac Bay, at one point, having a monopoly on the sea trade and being a part of the &lt;a href=\"Masconian%20Trade%20Way\"&gt;Masconian Trade Way&lt;/a&gt; between &lt;a href=\"Wayrest\"&gt;Wayrest&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Sentinel\"&gt;Sentinel&lt;/a&gt;. Daggerfall is situated on a mountain, in an area considered the Daenia Mountains and Daggerfall Bay. There are several coves located throughout the mountain range; one such notable one is the &lt;a href=\"Bad%20Man%27s%20Hallows\"&gt;Bad Man's Hallows&lt;/a&gt;, where an obscure cult worshipping the &lt;a href=\"Bad%20Man\"&gt;Bad Man&lt;/a&gt; of the &lt;a href=\"Bretony%20Pantheon\"&gt;Bretony Pantheon&lt;/a&gt; is known to be located in the area. The &lt;a href=\"Privateer%27s%20Hold\"&gt;Privateer's Hold&lt;/a&gt; is another settlement situated near the city of Daggerfall and is home to many Bandit Clans. Daggerfall is a heavily walled city that goes along the mountain. The Daenia River runs through the center of town, separating the &lt;a href=\"Daggerfall%20Marketplace\"&gt;Daggerfall Marketplace&lt;/a&gt; and the Daggerfall Guild Square. Southern Daggerfall is where the Marketplace is, as well as, the Smithy Hall and the &lt;a href=\"Daggerfall%20Cathedral\"&gt;Daggerfall Cathedral&lt;/a&gt;. The Southern Daggerfall Docks lead into the Daggerfall Bay and where the Sea of Ghosts meets the &lt;a href=\"Eltheric%20Ocean\"&gt;Eltheric Ocean&lt;/a&gt;. Northern Daggerfall is home to the local Guilds of Daggerfall and &lt;a href=\"the%20Rosy%20Lion\"&gt;the Rosy Lion&lt;/a&gt;; the most successful Inn is located near the City Gate. Northwestern Daggerfall is where many of the traders visit since the ports are larger than the Southern Ports, and is the home of several local Guild Shops. &lt;a href=\"Castle%20Daggerfall\"&gt;Castle Daggerfall&lt;/a&gt; is located in between both Northern and Southern Daggerfall and is the seat of power in the Kingdom.\nHistory.\n&lt;a href=\"First%20Era\"&gt;First Era&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe Origins of Bretony &amp; Daggerfall.\nDuring the early years of the first era, the &lt;a href=\"Nords\"&gt;Nords&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"Skyrim\"&gt;Skyrim&lt;/a&gt; had conquered the provinces surrounding Skyrim, from High Rock to the &lt;a href=\"Nibenay\"&gt;Nibenay&lt;/a&gt;, and to areas of &lt;a href=\"Morrowind\"&gt;Morrowind&lt;/a&gt;. Because of the Nordic Conquest over High Rock, many settlements were founded by the Nords ranging from &lt;a href=\"Camlorn\"&gt;Camlorn&lt;/a&gt; to &lt;a href=\"Reich%20Gradkeep\"&gt;Reich Gradkeep&lt;/a&gt;. The first recorded instance of the name Daggerfall was in &lt;a href=\"1E%20246\"&gt;1E 246&lt;/a&gt;, referring to the area around modern-day Daggerfall. According to a contemporary Nordic census of the time, Daggerfall was inhabited by a meager population of 216. A later census, in 3E 401, determined its population of 110,000. As time went on, the &lt;a href=\"War%20of%20Succession\"&gt;War of Succession&lt;/a&gt; divided the Nordic Kings of Skyrim, and brought their conquered territory down to the mountains that surround modern day Skyrim. The settlements already established were taken in by the Bretons that inhabited the land, governing as petty-kings and merchant-barons. Daggerfall was inhabited by the Bretons of &lt;a href=\"Glenumbra\"&gt;Glenumbra&lt;/a&gt;, and it quickly flourished as a fishing village and as a prominent farming town. Among the original rulers was &lt;a href=\"Corcyr%20of%20the%20Small%20Cock\"&gt;Corcyr of the Small Cock&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Edward\"&gt;Edward&lt;/a&gt;, a warrior of legend related to &lt;a href=\"Moraelyn\"&gt;Moraelyn&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"House%20Ra%27athim\"&gt;House Ra'athim&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe Direnni Hegemony &amp; the Alessian Reforms.\nThe Bretons of Daggerfall soon began to evolve into a bustling metropolis under the Kings of Daggerfall and formed a relationship with the &lt;a href=\"High%20Elves\"&gt;High Elves&lt;/a&gt; of the &lt;a href=\"Direnni%20Hegemony\"&gt;Direnni Hegemony&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"Balfiera\"&gt;Balfiera&lt;/a&gt;. The Direnni under &lt;a href=\"Raven%20Direnni\"&gt;Raven Direnni&lt;/a&gt; used Daggerfall as the base of operation during the conflicts with the &lt;a href=\"Alessian%20Reform\"&gt;Alessian Reform&lt;/a&gt;s. The earliest forms of Castle Daggerfall was used by Raven Direnni as her home, being one of the earliest occupants of the Castle. The Direnni and leaders of Tamriel had rebelled against the Alessians for quite some time, beginning with the &lt;a href=\"Battle%20of%20Skingrad\"&gt;Battle of Skingrad&lt;/a&gt; with &lt;a href=\"Rislav%20Larich\"&gt;Rislav Larich&lt;/a&gt;. The Direnni was a major opposition to the Alessians. With Daggerfall's involvement in the Direnni Clan's endeavors, the Bretons of Daggerfall partook in the &lt;a href=\"Battle%20of%20Glenumbra%20Moors%20%28Event%29\"&gt;Battle of Glenumbra Moors&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"1E%20482\"&gt;1E 482&lt;/a&gt;, against the Alessian Army under &lt;a href=\"Faolchu%20the%20Changeling\"&gt;Faolchu the Changeling&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href=\"Aiden%20Direnni\"&gt;Aiden Direnni&lt;/a&gt; led the charge against Faolchu's forces and defeated the Alessians with powerful fire magic.\nDaggerfall; the Superpower of the West.\nIn &lt;a href=\"1E%20609\"&gt;1E 609&lt;/a&gt;, the Direnni would slowly lose both the power and land that they had held on to for some time. This change caused Daggerfall to grow into a superpower among the nations of the Iliac Bay. Under the leadership of &lt;a href=\"King%20Thagore\"&gt;King Thagore&lt;/a&gt;, the Kingdom of Daggerfall grew into an economic, political, and militaristic power in the Iliac, slowly conquer the other regions in their side of the Bay. Thagore led a conquest over the &lt;a href=\"March%20of%20Glenpoint\"&gt;March of Glenpoint&lt;/a&gt;, located northeast of the Kingdom; it was after that, Daggerfall became the power it is today, with a monopoly over the trading scene in the area. As time went on, Daggerfall became hasty, resulting in their monopoly ending in a matter of weeks.\nThe Siege of Orsinium; the Fall of Igron.\nIn &lt;a href=\"1E%20948\"&gt;1E 948&lt;/a&gt;, the leader of Daggerfall was &lt;a href=\"King%20Joile\"&gt;King Joile&lt;/a&gt;, a shrewd tactician who desired to conquer the rest of High Rock, beyond his already established domain. Around the same time, &lt;a href=\"Torug%20gro-Igron\"&gt;Torug gro-Igron&lt;/a&gt; united the divided &lt;a href=\"Orc\"&gt;Orc&lt;/a&gt;ish tribes throughout &lt;a href=\"Wrothgar\"&gt;Wrothgar&lt;/a&gt; and established the &lt;a href=\"Kingdom%20of%20Orsinium\"&gt;First Kingdom of Orsinium&lt;/a&gt;, located on the western edge of Wrothgar. The Orsimer of &lt;a href=\"Clan%20Bagrakh\"&gt;Clan Bagrakh&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Clan%20Igron\"&gt;Clan Igron&lt;/a&gt; orchestrated a series of raids throughout the &lt;a href=\"Bjoulsae%20River\"&gt;Bjoulsae River&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Western%20Reach\"&gt;Western Reach&lt;/a&gt; which came to be known as the &lt;a href=\"Bjoulsae%20Raids\"&gt;Bjoulsae Raids&lt;/a&gt;. These actions have brought the attention to King Joile, prompting him to send a letter to &lt;a href=\"Gaiden%20Shinji\"&gt;Gaiden Shinji&lt;/a&gt; of the &lt;a href=\"Order%20of%20Diagna\"&gt;Order of Diagna&lt;/a&gt;, to coordinate a joint attack with the Orsimer of Orsinium. Joile's militia would consist of the &lt;a href=\"Knights%20of%20the%20Dragon\"&gt;Knights of the Dragon&lt;/a&gt;, the local knightly order of Daggerfall under the administration of &lt;a href=\"Lord%20Trystan\"&gt;Lord Trystan&lt;/a&gt;. In &lt;a href=\"1E%20950\"&gt;1E 950&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"Siege%20of%20Orsinium\"&gt;Siege of Orsinium&lt;/a&gt; began, and it involved all of the Wrothgarian Mountains, from the far west to the frozen east. Other settlements like the stronghold of &lt;a href=\"Fharun\"&gt;Fharun&lt;/a&gt; were involved and besieged by the invaders of the Iliac.\nThe Great Duel of Gaiden Shinji &amp; Baloth Bloodtusk.\nKing Joile had planned the whole invasion out and desired to conquer not only the First Kingdom of Orsinium but the province of Hammerfell as well. With the help of &lt;a href=\"General%20Mercedene\"&gt;General Mercedene&lt;/a&gt;, of &lt;a href=\"Reachmen\"&gt;Reachmen&lt;/a&gt; origin, Joile orchestrated the demise of both Gaiden Shinji and the Orcs of Wrothgar. Mercendene, by order of Joile, had the &lt;a href=\"Savage%20Sons\"&gt;Savage Sons&lt;/a&gt;, led by &lt;a href=\"Baloth%20Bloodtusk\"&gt;Baloth Bloodtusk&lt;/a&gt; to partake in the conflict and had both Shinji and Bloodtusk battle each other on the outskirts of Orsinium. Both Shinji and Bloodtusk fought valiantly with each other, complimenting each other's styles and wit in their duel. Both Trystan's forces and the Savage Sons knew not to interrupt the battle. However, Mercedene had purposely ordered her militia to fire on the duelists. Mercedene was stopped by a member of the Knights of the Dragon, and the Siege of Orsinium continued until &lt;a href=\"1E%20980\"&gt;1E 980&lt;/a&gt;, where it had officially ended, within thirty years. The Breton Army would advance into &lt;a href=\"Bangkorai\"&gt;Bangkorai&lt;/a&gt;, where they would intercept the Redguards under &lt;a href=\"Makela%20Leki\"&gt;Makela Leki&lt;/a&gt;, and begin their conquest over Hammerfell.\nThe Orsinium Aftermath; the Rise of Wayrest.\nJoile's conquest over Hammerfell would end abruptly when Makela Leki defended the region of Bangkorai from the Breton Horde. This was the beginning of Daggerfall's downfall. The Destruction of Orsinium opened a river route from the Bjoulsae River that goes down from the middle of the &lt;a href=\"Fiefdom%20of%20Menevia\"&gt;Fiefdom of Menevia&lt;/a&gt;. The minor fishing village of &lt;a href=\"Wayrest\"&gt;Wayrest&lt;/a&gt; began to thrive with new travelers moving to and fro from &lt;a href=\"Greater%20Bretony\"&gt;Greater Bretony&lt;/a&gt; to the &lt;a href=\"Western%20Reach\"&gt;Western Reach&lt;/a&gt;. Wayrest became a new trading empire in a matter of forty years and eventually became the Kingdom of Wayrest in several hundred years. As time went on, the &lt;a href=\"Kingdom%20of%20Sentinel\"&gt;Kingdom of Sentinel&lt;/a&gt; began to grow as a merchant city, gaining the same popularity as both Daggerfall and Wayrest. The monopoly that Daggerfall had for years, steadily decreased to the point where they had a third of the monopoly. The three kingdoms formed a trade way known as the &lt;a href=\"Masconian%20Trade%20Way\"&gt;Masconian Trade Way&lt;/a&gt;, which brought together the three rival kingdoms and brought down pirate activity.\n&lt;a href=\"Second%20Era\"&gt;Second Era&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe Black Drake of the Reach.\nEver since the &lt;a href=\"Battle%20of%20Granden%20Tor\"&gt;Battle of Granden Tor&lt;/a&gt;, the Kingdoms of High Rock have been at peace with each other and trade was thriving throughout the Masconian Trade Way and the three great kingdoms of the Iliac Bay. It was not until &lt;a href=\"2E%20541\"&gt;2E 541&lt;/a&gt; when High Rock would witness a war that would almost tear apart the kingdoms of High Rock. &lt;a href=\"Durcorach%20the%20Black%20Drake\"&gt;Durcorach the Black Drake&lt;/a&gt; invaded the province of High Rock with a horde of &lt;a href=\"Reachmen\"&gt;Reachmen&lt;/a&gt; from the &lt;a href=\"Western%20Reach\"&gt;Western Reach&lt;/a&gt; in an event known as the &lt;a href=\"Black%20Drake%27s%20Invasion\"&gt;Black Drake's Invasion&lt;/a&gt;. The &lt;a href=\"Conquest%20over%20Bangkorai\"&gt;Conquest over Bangkorai&lt;/a&gt; ended after the Reachmen besieged the city of &lt;a href=\"Evermore\"&gt;Evermore&lt;/a&gt; and the city of &lt;a href=\"Hallin%27s%20Stand\"&gt;Hallin's Stand&lt;/a&gt;, before moving into the &lt;a href=\"Kingdom%20of%20Wayrest\"&gt;Kingdom of Wayrest&lt;/a&gt;. The &lt;a href=\"Siege%20of%20Wayrest%20%282E%20542%29\"&gt;Siege of Wayrest&lt;/a&gt; occurred within the span of fifty-seven days until it ended in a stalemate, leaving for &lt;a href=\"Glenumbra\"&gt;Glenumbra&lt;/a&gt;, taking &lt;a href=\"Camlorn\"&gt;Camlorn&lt;/a&gt; in the process. Their next objective is the city of Daggerfall, which was under the reign of &lt;a href=\"Bergamot%20Deleyn\"&gt;Bergamot Deleyn&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe Great House Deleyn &amp; the Daggerfall Covenant.\nBergamot Deleyn derives from the Great House Deleyn, who have been the past leaders of Daggerfall for years. From &lt;a href=\"2E%20342\"&gt;2E 342&lt;/a&gt;, the Deleyns have ruled since the reign of &lt;a href=\"King%20Donel%20Deleyn\"&gt;King Donel Deleyn&lt;/a&gt;, who brought a union with &lt;a href=\"Sylvie%20Garclay\"&gt;Sylvie Garclay&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"Aldcroft\"&gt;Aldcroft&lt;/a&gt;, and other nations of Glenumbra. Bergamot defended the city with the Knights of the Dragon on his side, &lt;a href=\"Emeric\"&gt;Emeric&lt;/a&gt; and his army from Wayrest was following suit, with the power of the &lt;a href=\"Menevia%20Heavy%20Dragoons\"&gt;Menevia Heavy Dragoons&lt;/a&gt; on his side. The &lt;a href=\"Battle%20of%20Daggerfall\"&gt;Battle of Daggerfall&lt;/a&gt; begun when Emeric and Bergamot attacked the Reachmen Horde from both sides. Emeric's Navy and Bergamot's Army completely demolished the Horde, and the battle ultimately ended when Emeric slew Durcorach with his blade, severing his head. Bergamot finished the rest of the Reachmen and saved the province from further conflict. To protect themselves from future threats, the Kingdoms of High Rock (excluding &lt;a href=\"Northpoint\"&gt;Northpoint&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Fharun\"&gt;Fharun&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Jehanna\"&gt;Jehanna&lt;/a&gt;) formed an alliance called the &lt;a href=\"Daggerfall%20Covenant\"&gt;Daggerfall Covenant&lt;/a&gt;, with Emeric taking the helm as their leader.\nThe Alliance War &amp; the Greater Covenant.\nAs time went on, Wayrest grew into a much more significant power, more than Daggerfall had sustained for years. Things would take a turn for the worse when the &lt;a href=\"Knahaten%20Flu\"&gt;Knahaten Flu&lt;/a&gt; had hit Western Tamriel from &lt;a href=\"2E%20560\"&gt;2E 560&lt;/a&gt; to &lt;a href=\"2E%20603\"&gt;2E 603&lt;/a&gt;. King Bergamot, along with many notable leaders, were killed by the flu. King Gardner of Wayrest would also die, leaving Emeric the throne of Wayrest. Bergamot was replaced by &lt;a href=\"Folbert%20the%20Wide\"&gt;Folbert the Wide&lt;/a&gt;, who fought alongside High King Emeric during &lt;a href=\"King%20Ranser%27s%20War\"&gt;King Ranser's War&lt;/a&gt;, defending Wayrest and partaking in the &lt;a href=\"Battle%20of%20Markwasten%20Moor\"&gt;Battle of Markwasten Moor&lt;/a&gt;. Folbert would eventually pass away and &lt;a href=\"Casimir\"&gt;Casimir&lt;/a&gt; would take the throne of Daggerfall, and participate in the Greater Covenant with the &lt;a href=\"Redguards\"&gt;Redguards&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Orsimer\"&gt;Orsimer&lt;/a&gt;. Around the same time, &lt;a href=\"Varen%20Aquilarios\"&gt;Varen Aquilarios&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"Chorrol\"&gt;Chorrol&lt;/a&gt; rebelled against &lt;a href=\"Emperor%20Leovic\"&gt;Emperor Leovic&lt;/a&gt; and took the &lt;a href=\"Ruby%20Throne\"&gt;Ruby Throne&lt;/a&gt; as the Emperor of Cyrodiil. Aquilarios would vanish out of the blue and bring about the &lt;a href=\"Planemeld\"&gt;Planemeld&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"2E%20582\"&gt;2E 582&lt;/a&gt;, the Covenant gathered their arms to take the &lt;a href=\"Imperial%20City\"&gt;Imperial City&lt;/a&gt;. All the while, the Covenant faces the &lt;a href=\"Ebonheart%20Pact\"&gt;Ebonheart Pact&lt;/a&gt; of the East, and the &lt;a href=\"First%20Aldmeri%20Dominion\"&gt;First Aldmeri Dominion&lt;/a&gt; of the South. The Covenant had one objective, to preserve the Empire.\nBloodthorns throughout Daggerfall; the Bloodthorn War.\nDuring the &lt;a href=\"Alliance%20War\"&gt;Alliance War&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"2E%20582\"&gt;2E 582&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"Bloodthorn%20Cult\"&gt;Bloodthorn Cult&lt;/a&gt; of the &lt;a href=\"Western%20Reach\"&gt;Western Reach&lt;/a&gt; waged war with the Bretons of Glenumbra to destroy and corrupt the Daggerfall Covenant. The conflict began on the Island of &lt;a href=\"Betnikh\"&gt;Betnikh&lt;/a&gt;, where they eventually left to Daggerfall, operating from the shadows. A string of murders began to appear throughout the city, raising suspicion throughout the denizens of Daggerfall and the Daggerfall Guard under &lt;a href=\"Captain%20Aresin\"&gt;Captain Aresin&lt;/a&gt;. Aresin and another assailant known as the &lt;a href=\"Vestige\"&gt;Vestige&lt;/a&gt;, investigated the entire city to find the culprit of the murders. What the Vestige discovered was a large vine, with thorns jutting out and squirming on the ground. After defeating a Bloodthorn Agent, the Vestige learned about an assassination attempt on King Casimir, which both the Vestige and Aresin foiled. With news of the Bloodthorn Cult, Glenumbra was on high alert, and supposedly, the Cult was targeting the &lt;a href=\"Beldama%20Wyrd\"&gt;Beldama Wyrd&lt;/a&gt; and the Wyrd Tree in Northern Daenia.\n&lt;a href=\"Third%20Era\"&gt;Third Era&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe Dire Iliac Bay; the Camoran Usurper.\nIn &lt;a href=\"3E%20267\"&gt;3E 267&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"Camoran%20Usurper\"&gt;Camoran Usurper&lt;/a&gt; began his conquest over the provinces of Western Tamriel and had advanced into High Rock after besieging the Hammerfell city-states of &lt;a href=\"Taneth\"&gt;Taneth&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Rihad\"&gt;Rihad&lt;/a&gt;. The Usurper's Army consisted of mercenaries throughout Valenwood and Hammerfell, originating from the city of &lt;a href=\"Arenthia\"&gt;Arenthia&lt;/a&gt;. The kingdoms of the Iliac Bay were not in the position to fight back. The Kingdoms of &lt;a href=\"Sentinel\"&gt;Sentinel&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Wayrest\"&gt;Wayrest&lt;/a&gt; had leaders in their minor years, while the throne of Daggerfall was being fought for between two nobles named &lt;a href=\"Helena%20%28Lore%29\"&gt;Helena&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Jilathe\"&gt;Jilathe&lt;/a&gt;, her cousin. The only other notable nation was &lt;a href=\"Reich%20Gradkeep\"&gt;Reich Gradkeep&lt;/a&gt;, whose leader was deathly ill and died at the end of the year after. The Usurper's Invasion would abruptly end by the combined forces of several Iliac nations under &lt;a href=\"Baron%20Othrok\"&gt;Baron Othrok&lt;/a&gt;, the leader of &lt;a href=\"Dwynnen\"&gt;Dwynnen&lt;/a&gt;. Othrok defeated the Usurper at the &lt;a href=\"Battle%20of%20Firewaves\"&gt;Battle of Firewaves&lt;/a&gt;, located in the Iliac Bay.\nDaggerfall during the Imperial Simulacrum.\nDuring the &lt;a href=\"Imperial%20Simulacrum\"&gt;Imperial Simulacrum&lt;/a&gt; from &lt;a href=\"3E%20389\"&gt;3E 389&lt;/a&gt; to &lt;a href=\"3E%20399\"&gt;3E 399&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Emperor\"&gt;Emperor&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Uriel%20Septim%20VII\"&gt;Uriel Septim VII&lt;/a&gt; was imprisoned along with &lt;a href=\"Talin%20Warhaft\"&gt;Talin Warhaft&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;a href=\"Deadlands\"&gt;Deadlands&lt;/a&gt; by &lt;a href=\"Jagar%20Tharn\"&gt;Jagar Tharn&lt;/a&gt;. Tharn planned for months to capture the throne, and he was able to achieve so in the span of ten years. Tharn had a powerful weapon called the &lt;a href=\"Staff%20of%20Chaos\"&gt;Staff of Chaos&lt;/a&gt;, and he split it into nine pieces and scattered them across Tamriel, the staff was the only thing keeping Uriel Septim and Warhaft in &lt;a href=\"Oblivion\"&gt;Oblivion&lt;/a&gt;. A warrior escaped his clutches and traveled all corners of Tamriel to retrieve the missing pieces. The hero was known as the &lt;a href=\"Eternal%20Champion\"&gt;Eternal Champion&lt;/a&gt;, and he assembled the staff and defeated Jagar Tharn at the &lt;a href=\"Imperial%20Palace\"&gt;Imperial Palace&lt;/a&gt;. The Eternal Champion had at one point visited the city of Daggerfall in their quest to recover the pieces. The city of Daggerfall was under the rule of &lt;a href=\"King%20Tristyctor\"&gt;King Tristyctor&lt;/a&gt;.\nConflict across the Iliac; War of Betony.\nIn &lt;a href=\"3E%20403\"&gt;3E 403&lt;/a&gt;, the Island of &lt;a href=\"Betony\"&gt;Betony&lt;/a&gt; was under the control of &lt;a href=\"Lord%20Mogref\"&gt;Lord Mogref&lt;/a&gt;, who sought the aid of &lt;a href=\"King%20Lysandus\"&gt;King Lysandus&lt;/a&gt; of Daggerfall for monetary reasons, to make Betony a vassal of the Kingdom of Daggerfall. &lt;a href=\"Vanech\"&gt;Vanech&lt;/a&gt; of Daggerfall had also believed that Betony was the holy land of &lt;a href=\"Kynareth\"&gt;Kynareth&lt;/a&gt;, the Goddess-Protector of Daggerfall. &lt;a href=\"King%20Camaron\"&gt;King Camaron&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"Sentinel\"&gt;Sentinel&lt;/a&gt; believed that this action is illegal and that Sentinel has always been the property of Sentinel, citing a two-hundred-year-old agreement. The &lt;a href=\"War%20of%20Betony\"&gt;War of Betony&lt;/a&gt; commenced, and it occurred all throughout the Iliac Bay. From the side of Daggerfall, the leader of the Daggerfall Army was &lt;a href=\"Lord%20Bridwell\"&gt;Lord Bridwell&lt;/a&gt; who fought at the &lt;a href=\"Siege%20of%20Craghold\"&gt;Siege of Craghold&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Battle%20of%20the%20Bluffs\"&gt;Battle of the Bluffs&lt;/a&gt;, located all throughout High Rock and the Iliac Bay. &lt;a href=\"Nulfaga\"&gt;Nulfaga&lt;/a&gt;, the dowager mother of Lysandus foresaw Lysandus' death with this conflict and told him to be careful, or he will die. Lysandus, however, did not listen to his mother's warning, and he left to &lt;a href=\"Reich%20Gradkeep\"&gt;Reich Gradkeep&lt;/a&gt;, to discuss a peace treaty with Camaron. To ensure Daggerfall's victory, Vanech forged a fake treaty and gave it to Camaron, who saw the deception within the words. Camaron related, and the armies of Daggerfall and Sentinel began the &lt;a href=\"Riot%20in%20Reich%20Gradkeep\"&gt;Riot in Reich Gradkeep&lt;/a&gt;, which left the city destroyed.\nThe Demise of Lysandus; the Rise of Gothryd.\nThe battle continued into the Fiefdom of Reich Gradkeep, past the &lt;a href=\"Ravennian%20Forest\"&gt;Ravennian Forest&lt;/a&gt;, and into the &lt;a href=\"Cryngaine%20Field\"&gt;Cryngaine Field&lt;/a&gt;. The Army of Daggerfall, under the command of Bridwell and &lt;a href=\"Prince%20Gothryd\"&gt;Prince Gothryd&lt;/a&gt;, fought at the &lt;a href=\"Battle%20of%20Cryngaine%20Field\"&gt;Battle of Cryngaine Field&lt;/a&gt; against the forces of Sentinel under the administration of King Camaron and &lt;a href=\"Lord%20Oresme\"&gt;Lord Oresme&lt;/a&gt;. Nulfaga had arrived into the battlefield, albeit in the distance and feared that Lysandus would die in this battle. To prevent this, Nulfaga and her &lt;a href=\"Dragons%20%28Lore%29\"&gt;Dragon&lt;/a&gt; ally named &lt;a href=\"Skakmat\"&gt;Skakmat&lt;/a&gt; covered the battle with a large thicket of fog, causing the warriors of both kingdoms to go blind. Amidst the conflict, &lt;a href=\"Lord%20Woodborne\"&gt;Lord Woodborne&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"Wayrest\"&gt;Wayrest&lt;/a&gt; had assassinated Lysandus during the battle with a stray arrow. Believing that Camaron was the killer, Gothryd challenged Camaron to a duel after being named King of Daggerfall. The two fought bravely, but the newly named Prince ultimately defeated camaron. And so, the War of Betony had officially ended, creating animosity between both Daggerfall and Sentinel. To dispel this, Gothryd had married &lt;a href=\"Princess%20Aubk%27i\"&gt;Princess Aubk'i&lt;/a&gt; to create a friendship with the Kingdom of Sentinel, and it surely did but &lt;a href=\"Queen%20Akorithi\"&gt;Queen Akorithi&lt;/a&gt; still mourned Camaron's death.\nMission to Daggerfall; the Ascension of Lysandus.\nIn &lt;a href=\"3E%20405\"&gt;3E 405&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"Emperor\"&gt;Emperor&lt;/a&gt; of the &lt;a href=\"Septim%20Dynasty\"&gt;Septim Dynasty&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Uriel%20Septim%20VII\"&gt;Uriel Septim VII&lt;/a&gt; sent &lt;a href=\"The%20Agent\"&gt;an Agent&lt;/a&gt; in the Kingdom of Daggerfall to deal with the sudden rise of Lysandus' ghost. After entering the Iliac Bay from the &lt;a href=\"Bjoulsae%20River\"&gt;Bjoulsae River&lt;/a&gt;, the Agent crashed land on &lt;a href=\"Privateer%27s%20Hold\"&gt;Privateer's Hold&lt;/a&gt;, a bandit stronghold in Daggerfall. Afterward, the Agent met with &lt;a href=\"Lady%20Brisienna%20Magnessen\"&gt;Lady Brisienna Magnessen&lt;/a&gt;, who told the story of Lysandus to the Agent. Quite sometime later, the Agent was told to meet &lt;a href=\"Medora%20Direnni\"&gt;Medora Direnni&lt;/a&gt; from the &lt;a href=\"Isle%20of%20Balfiera\"&gt;Isle of Balfiera&lt;/a&gt;, who would allow the Agent to relieve Lysandus' soul and to find his murderer. With Medora's magic, the Agent traveled to the &lt;a href=\"Fiefdom%20of%20Menevia\"&gt;Fiefdom of Menevia&lt;/a&gt; and consulted with Lysandus at his tomb. Lysandus revealed the truth, which Lord Woodborne had assassinated Lysandus in an area outside of the Battle of Cryngaine Field. The Agent traveled into Wayrest, where they ultimately killed Woodborne, having Lysandus' soul ascend into &lt;a href=\"Aetherius\"&gt;Aetherius&lt;/a&gt;.\nGothryd's Iliac Bay; Journey to Aetherius.\nAt this point, the &lt;a href=\"Totem%20of%20Tiber%20Septim\"&gt;Totem of Tiber Septim&lt;/a&gt; began to come into the possession of the Agent, which held the power of &lt;a href=\"Numidium\"&gt;Numidium&lt;/a&gt;. Who was the Brass Dwarven Animunculi that &lt;a href=\"Tiber%20Septim\"&gt;Tiber Septim&lt;/a&gt; himself had used in his &lt;a href=\"Tiber%20Wars\"&gt;conquest&lt;/a&gt; over &lt;a href=\"Tamriel\"&gt;Tamriel&lt;/a&gt;. Many different royal bloodlines throughout the Iliac Bay have sought the totem for their own purposes, and one of them was King Gothryd of Daggerfall. Lady Brisienna learned the Totem was located in Castle Daggerfall and tasked the Agent into stealing it for the Emperor. After taking it, Gothryd came into possession of it, resulting in uniting the nations of the Iliac Bay. After giving the Totem to Gothryd, the Agent traveled into Aetherius to find the &lt;a href=\"Mantellan%20Crux\"&gt;Mantellan Crux&lt;/a&gt; and to obtain the &lt;a href=\"Mantella\"&gt;Mantella&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe Miracle of Peace; Warp in the West.\nIn &lt;a href=\"3E%20405\"&gt;3E 405&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"Warp%20in%20the%20West\"&gt;Warp in the West&lt;/a&gt; had occurred through the power of a &lt;a href=\"Dragon%20Break\"&gt;Dragon Break&lt;/a&gt;, a Dragon Break is a magical anomaly that caused the alternate realities of who gets the Totem to all happen simultaneously. The outcome had the three kingdoms of the Iliac Bay to absorb the smaller nations of the region into their domain. Daggerfall had taken a substantial amount of territory, namely the western portion of the &lt;a href=\"Fiefdom%20of%20Anticlere\"&gt;Fiefdom of Anticlere&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Fiefdom%20of%20Ykalon\"&gt;Fiefdom of Ykalon&lt;/a&gt;. The area that would be the Kingdom of Daggerfall (i.e. &lt;a href=\"Daenia\"&gt;Daenia&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Ilessan%20Hills\"&gt;Ilessan Hills&lt;/a&gt;) had undergone a dangerous forest fire where the Kingdoms of Daggerfall, Wayrest, and Orsinium were fighting three-way conflicts, causing volleys of arrows to spread across the landscape. Gothryd and Aubk'i were becoming leaders popular among the Septim Empire and the Iliac, their undying relationship has strengthened the bond between Daggerfall and Sentinel.\nGothryd &amp; Aubk'i; Future into the Fourth Era.\nIn &lt;a href=\"3E%20433\"&gt;3E 433&lt;/a&gt; during the &lt;a href=\"Oblivion%20Crisis\"&gt;Oblivion Crisis&lt;/a&gt;, King Gothryd and Queen Aubk'i had become one of the most powerful families during the waning years of the third era. Gothryd and Aubk'i had a child named Camaron II, who married &lt;a href=\"Lady%20Kelmena\"&gt;Lady Kelmena&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"Camlorn\"&gt;Camlorn&lt;/a&gt;, to establish an alliance between Gothryd and &lt;a href=\"Duke%20Senhyn\"&gt;Duke Senhyn&lt;/a&gt;. Areas between several different kingdoms have local battles that have yet to explode into conflicts equal in size as the War of Betony or Ranser's War in early years. The Warp in the West had ended years of conflict in a matter of two days, resulting in one of the most progressive provinces in the area. While Daggerfall rises as the greater power, other kingdoms like Sentinel under &lt;a href=\"King%20Lhotun\"&gt;King Lhotun&lt;/a&gt; and Wayrest under &lt;a href=\"Queen%20Elysana\"&gt;Queen Elysana&lt;/a&gt;. Gothryd and Aubk'i would rule the Kingdom of Daggerfall throughout the Oblivion Crisis and into the &lt;a href=\"Fourth%20Era\"&gt;Fourth Era&lt;/a&gt;."}

However, Daggerfall thrived under Nordic rule and thus had an advantage over its neighbors upon independence.\nThe kingdom became a powerhouse for the\u00a0&lt;a href=\"Nede%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Nedic&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Direnni%20Clan\"&gt;Direnni Clan&lt;/a&gt;, but still continued to thrive even after the clan lost power in &lt;a href=\"High%20Rock%20%28Online%29\"&gt;High Rock&lt;/a&gt; after the &lt;a href=\"Battle%20of%20Glenumbra%20Moors%20%28Event%29\"&gt;Battle of Glenumbra Moors&lt;/a&gt;.\u00a0By\u00a0&lt;a href=\"1E%20609\"&gt;1E 609&lt;/a&gt;, under the rule of\u00a0&lt;a href=\"Thagore\"&gt;King Thagore&lt;/a&gt;, Daggerfall was the main economic, cultural, and military force in High Rock, and it remained so for millennia until the city of &lt;a href=\"Wayrest%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Wayrest&lt;/a&gt; eventually surpassed it.\nIn &lt;a href=\"2E%20541\"&gt;2E 541&lt;/a&gt;, an army of &lt;a href=\"Reachmen%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Reachmen&lt;/a&gt; under Emperor &lt;a href=\"Durcorach\"&gt;Durcorach&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"Cyrodiil%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Cyrodiil&lt;/a&gt;, the progenitor of the &lt;a href=\"Longhouse%20Emperors\"&gt;Longhouse Emperors&lt;/a&gt;, invaded High Rock. They began a fifty-seven day siege at Wayrest, before eventually being driven out. They instead assaulted Daggerfall, but were met by the armies of Wayrest. Durcorach was killed by &lt;a href=\"High%20King%20Emeric%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Emeric&lt;/a&gt; of Cumberland, and afterwards, the kingdoms of High Rock signed the First Daggerfall Covenant, the terms of which were that if any kingdom was to come under attack, all the other kingdoms would defend it.\nIn &lt;a href=\"2E%20566\"&gt;2E 566&lt;/a&gt;, Daggerfall and the other kingdoms reinforced Wayrest when it was assaulted by an army under the command of &lt;a href=\"King%20Ranser\"&gt;King Ranser&lt;/a&gt;, obeying the terms of the Covenant. When Ranser was defeated, Daggerfall and the other kingdoms signed the &lt;a href=\"Daggerfall%20Covenant\"&gt;Second Daggerfall Covenant&lt;/a&gt;, which now included &lt;a href=\"Hammerfell%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Hammerfell&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Orsinium%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Orsinium&lt;/a&gt;, which was finally granted provincial status by King Emeric.\nIn &lt;a href=\"2E%20582\"&gt;2E 582&lt;/a&gt;, King Casimir was almost killed by the &lt;a href=\"Bloodthorn%20Cult\"&gt;Bloodthorn Cult&lt;/a&gt;, but his life was saved by the &lt;a href=\"Vestige\"&gt;Vestige&lt;/a&gt;, who had just arrived in Daggerfall after dropping into the sea off the coast of &lt;a href=\"Stros%20M%27Kai%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Stros M'Kai&lt;/a&gt; and brought to the city.\nTravel.\nDaggerfall contains a wayshrine that sits just behind the Rosy Lion Inn in Castle Town. It is automatically unlocked as soon as you enter &lt;a href=\"Glenumbra%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Glenumbra&lt;/a&gt;.\nAt the Southern Docks, you can speak to &lt;a href=\"Gilzir\"&gt;Gilzir&lt;/a&gt; to get to the islands of &lt;a href=\"Betnikh\"&gt;Betnikh&lt;/a&gt; and Stros M'Kai by ship.\nGetting there.\nIf you belong to the &lt;a href=\"Daggerfall%20Covenant\"&gt;Covenant&lt;/a&gt;, you can simply teleport to the Wayshrine as it will be unlocked automatically after escaping Coldharbour. If you are a &lt;a href=\"Ebonheart%20Pact\"&gt;Pact&lt;/a&gt; player, you first must have completed &lt;a href=\"God%20of%20Schemes\"&gt;God of Schemes&lt;/a&gt; and accepted &lt;a href=\"Cadwell%27s%20Silver\"&gt;Cadwell's Silver&lt;/a&gt; in order to reach Daggerfall.

To think that, within my lifetime, I would be able to put to paper a fifth addendum, and one that involves so illustrious an architectural example as &lt;a href=\"Castle%20Dour%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Castle Dour&lt;/a&gt;!\nYes, loyal readers of my digests will be familiar with the Main Keep, the &lt;a href=\"Svartr%27s%20Donjon\"&gt;Svartr's Donjon&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"Temple%20of%20the%20Divines%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Temple of the Divines&lt;/a&gt;, and the curtain walls that dominate the skyline of Solitude.

Though construction only started within the past year, it already nears completion.\nWe call the new edifice the &lt;a href=\"Tower%20of%20the%20Wolf\"&gt;Tower of the Wolf&lt;/a&gt;, drawing its name from the noble beast that adorns Solitude's heraldry. How impressive it looks, sweeping up to the stark sky, dwarfing even &lt;a href=\"Svartr\"&gt;Svartr&lt;/a&gt;'s Donjon! I am happy to report that the quarry which furnished the castle's original stone was able to supply what was needed for the construction of the Tower of the Wolf. Reports of the quarry's depletion were apparently unfounded.\nAs excited as I am to discuss the Tower of the Wolf in greater architectural detail, I am unfortunately unable to. Access to the tower has been denied to all but those actively working on the structure. I appealed to the &lt;a href=\"Blue%20Palace%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Blue Palace&lt;/a&gt; for special exception, given my area of interest, but the bureaucrats rebuffed me. I was undeterred in my appeals, and you can imagine my shock when I received a reply not from some minor courtier, but from the high king himself!\n\"The interior spaces of the Tower of the Wolf must be maintained in secrecy, given the prying eyes of &lt;a href=\"Jorunn%20the%20False%20King\"&gt;Jorunn the False King&lt;/a&gt;\" wrote High King Svargrim. I could not deny his most pragmatic logic, for the tower is ultimately of military value. And yet there is hope. \"The tower nears completion even as I write this missive,\" High King Svargrim continued. \"And when it is complete, the people of Solitude will understand what an accomplishment this edifice is for our people.\"\nWe need only wait, my loyal readers!"}

Their origin is the &lt;a href=\"Adamantine%20Tower\"&gt;Adamantine Tower&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"High%20Rock\"&gt;High Rock&lt;/a&gt;, with the other Towers attempting to imitate its metaphysical properties. It is believed by some that that their existence ensures &lt;a href=\"Mundus\"&gt;Mundus&lt;/a&gt; remains stabilized and prevents it from dissolving back into &lt;a href=\"Oblivion%20%28Realm%29\"&gt;Oblivion&lt;/a&gt;. Each Tower bears a \"stone\" that serves as its heart and allows it to channel creatia from &lt;a href=\"Oblivion%20%28Realm%29\"&gt;Oblivion&lt;/a&gt;, which in turn may allow the Tower to shape creation around itself.\nThe concept of the Towers was introduced in series of &lt;a href=\"unlicensed%20texts\"&gt;unlicensed texts&lt;/a&gt; known as the \"&lt;a href=\"Nu-Mantia%20Intercept\"&gt;Nu-Mantia Intercept&lt;/a&gt;s\", written by &lt;a href=\"Michael%20Kirkbride\"&gt;Michael Kirkbride&lt;/a&gt;, former writer and designer for &lt;a href=\"Bethesda%20Softworks\"&gt;Bethesda Softworks&lt;/a&gt;, and has since been expanded upon in texts from and .\nCreation of the Towers.\nThe origins of the first tower, the &lt;a href=\"Direnni%20Tower\"&gt;Adamantine Tower&lt;/a&gt; are uncertain, but according to &lt;a href=\"Mer\"&gt;Elven&lt;/a&gt; religion, it was created when the &lt;a href=\"Aedra\"&gt;Aedra&lt;/a&gt; gathered to decide &lt;a href=\"Lorkhan\"&gt;Lorkhan&lt;/a&gt;'s punishment for his involvement in the creation of Mundus. Akatosh's vessel planted itself into Nirn and became the Adamantine Tower, and it was on this first tower that the Convention took place.\nImmediately following &lt;a href=\"Heart%20of%20Lorkhan\"&gt;Lorkhan's Heart&lt;/a&gt; being torn from his body, it was flung across the sea, creating &lt;a href=\"Red%20Mountain\"&gt;Red Mountain&lt;/a&gt; where it landed. Immediately afterwards, creation stabilized, possibly due to the landing of the Heart, which created the Red Tower.\nThe remaining Towers were created by various mer throughout the &lt;a href=\"Merethic%20Era\"&gt;Merethic Era&lt;/a&gt;, either in imitation of the Adamantine Tower, or as an expression of the mer's own desires for creation and self-definition.\nTowers and Stones.\nEach Tower bears a focusing Stone that provides it with stability and power, which is used to harvest raw energy from &lt;a href=\"Aetherius\"&gt;Aetherius&lt;/a&gt; to help the Tower reshape the landscape around it. To change the nature of this Stone will change the nature of the Tower, and the land around it. Control of a Tower itself may also allow this type of control over the land as well.\nIt has been suggested that when a Tower's Stone is destroyed or altered, that Tower ceases to function, although there is little direct evidence of this.\nKnown Towers.\n&lt;a href=\"Loremaster%20Celarus\"&gt;Loremaster Celarus&lt;/a&gt; of the &lt;a href=\"Psijic%20Order%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Psijic Order&lt;/a&gt; states that there are eight towers in &lt;a href=\"Nirn\"&gt;Nirn&lt;/a&gt;. Ada-Mantia and the Red Tower are the only two that were created by the et'Ada, most of the others were made by the various races of Mer.\nAda-Mantia.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Adamantine%20Tower\"&gt;Adamantine Tower&lt;/a&gt;, also known as the Direnni Tower, was the first Tower. It was created on the island of &lt;a href=\"Balfiera\"&gt;Balfiera&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;a href=\"Illiac%20Bay\"&gt;Illiac Bay&lt;/a&gt; and is believed to be the oldest known structure in Tamriel. It is considered an active tower and its stone is known as the Zero Stone, which is the &lt;a href=\"Convention\"&gt;Convention&lt;/a&gt;.\nRed Tower.\n&lt;a href=\"Red%20Mountain\"&gt;Red Mountain&lt;/a&gt; was the second Tower that was created when Auri-El and Trinimac killed Lorkhan and shot his heart into &lt;a href=\"Vvardenfell\"&gt;Vvardenfell&lt;/a&gt;. Red Mountain grew around its stone, the &lt;a href=\"Heart%20of%20Lorkhan\"&gt;Heart of Lorkhan&lt;/a&gt;, and it granted a special kind of divinity to Mundus. With two Towers in place Mundus was stable, so Auri-El and several other Aedra left the mortal plane. The Aldmer, seeking to follow Auri-El and achieve divinity, began to construct their own Towers.\nThe Red Tower was deactivated at the conclusion of when the &lt;a href=\"Nerevarine\"&gt;Nerevarine&lt;/a&gt; infiltrated &lt;a href=\"Dagoth%20Ur%20%28Character%29\"&gt;Dagoth Ur's&lt;/a&gt; citadel with the aim of destroying the enchantments placed around the Heart of Lorkhan. Once the enchantments were destroyed, the Heart disappeared. The mountain later &lt;a href=\"Red%20Year\"&gt;erupted&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"4E%205\"&gt;4E 5&lt;/a&gt;.\nCrystal-like-Law.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Crystal%20Tower\"&gt;Crystal Tower&lt;/a&gt; is located in &lt;a href=\"Alinor\"&gt;Alinor&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;a href=\"Summerset%20Isle\"&gt;Summerset Isle&lt;/a&gt;.

During the &lt;a href=\"Oblivion%20Crisis\"&gt;Oblivion Crisis&lt;/a&gt;, it was turned over to the &lt;a href=\"Thalmor\"&gt;Thalmor&lt;/a&gt;, however it was attacked and destroyed by legions of &lt;a href=\"Daedra\"&gt;Daedra&lt;/a&gt;. Its Stone is &lt;a href=\"Transparent%20Law\"&gt;Transparent Law&lt;/a&gt;.\nWhite Gold.\nThe &lt;a href=\"White-Gold%20Tower\"&gt;White-Gold Tower&lt;/a&gt; is the ancient structure which dominates the &lt;a href=\"Imperial%20City\"&gt;Imperial City&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Cyrodiil\"&gt;Cyrodiil&lt;/a&gt;. It was built by the &lt;a href=\"Ayleid\"&gt;Ayleid&lt;/a&gt;s, and has been referred to as \"one of the axes of creation.\" and \"an echo of the ur-Tower\" in its imitation of the Adamantine Tower.\nAlthough the tower was built with a central spire the structure itself resembles the Wheel, with eight lesser towers forming a ring around it. This formation is described as a unique \"Wheel within the Wheel\" and gives the White-Gold Tower a power over creatia unlike any of the other Towers. While other Towers bind magic and bleed it, the White-Gold Tower harnessed the power of creation. Its stone was the &lt;a href=\"Chim-el%20Adabal\"&gt;Chim-el Adabal&lt;/a&gt;, the central gemstone within in the &lt;a href=\"Amulet%20of%20Kings\"&gt;Amulet of Kings&lt;/a&gt;. \n&lt;a href=\"Phrastus%20of%20Elinhir\"&gt;Phrastus of Elinhir&lt;/a&gt; claims that the stone of the White-Gold Tower is actually the &lt;a href=\"Tel%20Var%20Stones\"&gt;Tel Var Stones&lt;/a&gt; built with it. According to the &lt;a href=\"Prophecy%20of%20the%20Dragonborn\"&gt;Prophecy of the Dragonborn&lt;/a&gt; recorded on &lt;a href=\"Alduin%27s%20Wall\"&gt;Alduin's Wall&lt;/a&gt;, the fall of the White Tower occurred during the &lt;a href=\"Oblivion%20Crisis\"&gt;Oblivion Crisis&lt;/a&gt; or the &lt;a href=\"Great%20War\"&gt;Great War&lt;/a&gt;\u2014\"\"When the &lt;a href=\"Martin%20Septim\"&gt;Dragonborn Ruler&lt;/a&gt; loses his throne, and the White Tower falls.\"\"\nOrichalc.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Orichalc%20Tower\"&gt;Orichalc Tower&lt;/a&gt; was believed to have been located on the continent of &lt;a href=\"Yokuda\"&gt;Yokuda&lt;/a&gt;. It was built by the &lt;a href=\"Lefthanded%20Elves\"&gt;Lefthanded Elves&lt;/a&gt; and is likely to have been constructed from &lt;a href=\"Orichalcum%20Ore\"&gt;Orichalcum&lt;/a&gt;. The Tower was deactivated when a &lt;a href=\"Redguard\"&gt;Redguard&lt;/a&gt; attempted to perform the swordstroke \"Pankratosword\" and Yokuda sank into the ocean. Its stone was said to be \"a sword.\"\nWalk-Brass.\nWalk Brass, also known as the Brass Tower, is the &lt;a href=\"Numidium\"&gt;Numidium&lt;/a&gt;\u2014the brass god created by the &lt;a href=\"Dwemer\"&gt;Dwemer&lt;/a&gt;. Following the &lt;a href=\"Disappearance%20of%20the%20Dwarves\"&gt;Dwemer's disappearance&lt;/a&gt;, it sat dormant until it was traded to &lt;a href=\"Tiber%20Septim\"&gt;Tiber Septim&lt;/a&gt; by the &lt;a href=\"Tribunal\"&gt;Tribunal&lt;/a&gt; for a degree of autonomy from &lt;a href=\"Cyrodiil\"&gt;Cyrodiil&lt;/a&gt;. It was used to assault Summerset and unite Tamriel under one empire. It was later destroyed by &lt;a href=\"Zurin%20Arctus\"&gt;Zurin Arctus&lt;/a&gt;, the Underking.\nDuring the events of it was rebuilt and used again, which resulted in the &lt;a href=\"Warp%20in%20the%20West\"&gt;Warp in the West&lt;/a&gt;, after which it disappeared from existence.\nIts stone was originally the &lt;a href=\"Heart%20of%20Lorkhan\"&gt;Heart of Lorkhan&lt;/a&gt;. The &lt;a href=\"Mantella\"&gt;Mantella&lt;/a&gt;, a powerful soul gem that contained the oversoul of &lt;a href=\"Talos\"&gt;Talos&lt;/a&gt;, Zurin Arctus, and &lt;a href=\"Ysmir\"&gt;Ysmir&lt;/a&gt;, was used as its replacement after the disappearance of the Dwemer.\nGreen-Sap.\nGreen-Sap has been stated to be made up of a large network of &lt;a href=\"Graht-oak\"&gt;Graht-oak&lt;/a&gt; trees in which began with the Elden Tree of the secret &lt;a href=\"Elden%20Grove\"&gt;Elden Grove&lt;/a&gt;, all in which are planted with a 'perchance acorn'. The stone of Green-Sap is said to be \"a fruit\", with a perchance acorn being the most likely of these.\nFollowing the &lt;a href=\"Alessian%20Slave%20Rebellion\"&gt;Alessian Slave Rebellion&lt;/a&gt;, the Elden Tree was almost converted in a new White-Gold after an Ayleid known as &lt;a href=\"Anumaril\"&gt;Anumaril&lt;/a&gt; attempted to convert the region into a new home for the Ayleids. Anumaril stopped the Elden Tree from moving by turning its perchance acorn into a definite acorn, but his plan to convert the tree was unsuccessful. When &lt;a href=\"Queen%20Ayrenn\"&gt;Queen Ayrenn&lt;/a&gt; stepped into The Orrery beneath the Elden Tree in &lt;a href=\"2E%20582\"&gt;2E 582&lt;/a&gt;, she emerged as herself, proving to the Bosmer that she was a righteous and true queen. Another major hub of the Green-Sap tower is the Graht-Oak of &lt;a href=\"Falinesti\"&gt;Falinesti&lt;/a&gt;. In the late &lt;a href=\"Third%20Era\"&gt;Third Era&lt;/a&gt; the city stopped walking and rooted itself for the first time in recorded history.\nSnow Throat.\nSnow Throat, also known as the Snow Tower, is typically interpreted as the &lt;a href=\"Throat%20of%20the%20World\"&gt;Throat of the World&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Skyrim\"&gt;Skyrim&lt;/a&gt;. According to &lt;a href=\"Alduin%27s%20Wall\"&gt;Alduin's Wall&lt;/a&gt;, the Snow Tower lies \"sundered, kingless, bleeding\" in the &lt;a href=\"Fourth%20Era\"&gt;Fourth Era&lt;/a&gt;\nIts stone is said to be \"The Cave.\" The peak is described as being only half there.\nDoomcrag.\nDoomcrag is speculated by &lt;a href=\"Morachellis\"&gt;Morachellis&lt;/a&gt; to be one of the Towers. It was built by the Ayleids in the city of Erokii, once the greatest Ayleid city in northwest Tamriel. The Ayleids who colonized this land brought with them a powerful relic, Lattanaya, forged by their greatest sorcerers, that helped to tame the wilderness and allowed them to survive. It helped plants grow and cured illnesses, helping to bring life to the barren wilderness.\nFollowing the attack of the savages who lived in these lands before the Ayleids, blood and death tainted the relic, changing it into Abagandra. When the &lt;a href=\"Count%20Verandis%20Ravenwatch\"&gt;vampire&lt;/a&gt; touched it eons later, the corruption intensified. The Tower was deactivated when its stone, the Lightless Remnant, was moved to the Coldharbor due to the pact made between Count Verandis Ravenwatch and Molag Bal.\nCoral Tower.\n&lt;a href=\"Telenger%20the%20Artificer\"&gt;Telenger the Artificer&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Morachellis\"&gt;Morachellis&lt;/a&gt; consider this Tower to be a failed imitation of a true Tower."}

In the course of this search, he claims to have discovered ancient &lt;a href=\"Reachfolk\"&gt;Reachfolk&lt;/a&gt; manuscripts. These manuscripts, which Edette insisted were written in a now-dead script from a time when the Reach culture was at its apex, contained a cycle of epic poems composed by the legendary vateshran, &lt;a href=\"Tosmorn\"&gt;Tosmorn&lt;/a&gt;.\nEdette spent decades translating these manuscripts into the modern tongue. His results are incomplete, which Edette contributed to the advanced deterioration of the manuscripts and his own imperfect knowledge of the script he sought to translate. He died shortly after completing his work and selling the manuscript for publication.\nAlmost immediately after their release, scholars decried the poems as fakes and Edette's story as fabrication. Most point to the fact that Reachfolk today are people with only an oral tradition, and nothing in the historical record suggests they ever used any sort of writing in the past. Other opponenets of Eddete's narrative claim the Reachfolk are incapable of the level of artistic expression attributed to Tosmorn. This argument is facile, and often made by academic with no experience of the Reach or its vateshrans (lore keepers).\nIn opposition to those that cry forgery are those that extol Edette's work for bringing attention to the under-appreciated genius of Vateshran Tosmorn. In particular, they appreciate the fluidity, evocativeness, and rustic purity of the poetic fragments-a far cry from the ridid poetic forms of the &lt;a href=\"Bretons\"&gt;Bretons&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Imperials\"&gt;Imperials&lt;/a&gt;. Tehy also point out that lost arts are not a rarity in &lt;a href=\"Tamriel\"&gt;Tamriel's&lt;/a&gt; historical record. Thus, Edette's claims of a lost Reach script is hardly an upheaval, especially when considering how little academic research has been devoted to the culture of Reachfolk in comparison to the other peoples of Tamriel.\nBoth sides bemoan the lack of the one thing that could definitvely prove or disprove Edette's claims: the manuscripts he claims to have found and translated. Those who knew him in life said Edette was a reclusive and lonely soul, often isolating himself to widlerness camps for long stretches of the year while conducting his research and working on his translations. He was thought to have dozens of campsites throughout the Reach, though only a handful of these have been located by enterprising scholars, hopeful to rediscover Edette's manuscripts. Opponents of Edette claim the reason the manuscripts are absent is because they never existed in the first place. Proponents of Edette psoit the manuscripts, already decomposing when they were discovered, have likely rotted into nothingness.\nAnd so the matter stands, trapped upon a knife's edge, caught between doubt and adulation. The years I have spent poring over the poetical fragments have offered me no answers. And so I invite you, dear reader, to read for yourself and wonder if what follows are our only window into the works of the acclaimed Reach vateshran, Tosmorn, or nothing but an elaborate forgery.\n&lt;a href=\"Vanesse%20Aurilie\"&gt;Vanesse Aurilie&lt;/a&gt;\n5 Morning Star, &lt;a href=\"2E%20322\"&gt;2E 322&lt;/a&gt;"}

This betrayer now hides in the cavern at the end of the school's five trials.\"\nWalkthrough.\nOutside of Rahni'Za, School of Warriors, you will find a woman named Fada at-Glina. She will tell you that the swordmasters at the school have all been corrupted into serving the Serpent. A betrayer had entered the school, passed all the trials and slain the headmaster. She will ask you to complete the trials to gain entry into the school so you can cleanse it of this corruption. \nYour first trial is to light the braziers leading the way to the school. To this effect you must beat a gargoyle standing in front of a tomb just up the hill, then use the tomb to summon the &lt;a href=\"Flame-Bearer\"&gt;Flame-Bearer&lt;/a&gt;. You will find the forst brazier on the road ahead, but you will have to fight your way through some corrupted disciples first. Once the Flame-Bearer has lit this brazier, she will disappear, but you can get a new one from the tomb just ahead, guarded by another gargoyle. Repeat this song and dance a few more times as you proceed up the path, until all three braziers are lit. After this, you must defeat a swordmaster named Kalith, who can be found further up the path. Kalith will summon two gargoyles once he is at half health, and he will summon shades of himself later in the battle. Defeat all of these enemies to complete the Trial of Fire. \nOnce this is done, head inside though the door to your south. Proceed up the path until you find the ghost of a man named Zabeth kneeling by his dead body. Speak with him and he will tell you thathe was not turned into a thrall because he was too much of a coward to fight the betrayer. He will also tell you about the trials ahead. These are the Trial of the Arena, the Trial of Air and the Trial of Martial Knowledge. These can be completed in any order. \nTo complete the Trial of Martial Knowledge, you must collect books from around the school; it is efficient to do this while working on the other trials. To start the Trial of the Arena, head down the cliff to the arena and speak with the ghost of &lt;a href=\"Master%20Nadar\"&gt;Master Nadar&lt;/a&gt;. He will allow you to start the trial. You will be facing several waves of foes, culminating in a battle with &lt;a href=\"Arena%20Champion%20Nimlanath\"&gt;Arena Champion Nimlanath&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Arena%20Champion%20Ireh\"&gt;Arena Champion Ireh&lt;/a&gt;. These are very strong opponents, so make sure to kill all the other enemies first so you are not overwhelmed, then focus on one over the other to make this a 1v1 as quickly as possible. Once they are dead, you have completed the Trial of the Arena. \nHead along the path east of the arena to enter he Beast Pits, where you will find one of the books for the Trial of Martial Knowledge, \"&lt;a href=\"The%20Trial%20of%20the%20Arena\"&gt;The Trial of the Arena&lt;/a&gt;\". It can be found in the middle of the big southern room, guarded by the beast &lt;a href=\"Wapzgin\"&gt;Wapzgin&lt;/a&gt;. If you are careful, you can get the book without alerting Wapzgin to your presence. If you do find yourself in combat with the beast, take out his allies first s you have only the beast himself to worry about. \nHead north out of the pits. As you fight the enemies, you may find the Sands of True Sight on their bodies; you will need this for the Trial of Air. Once you are back in the main area, head along the northwestern path from the entrance. You will arrive at the training grounds; one of the books will be on the balcony of the barracks to the left. There are no enemies in the building, so you can just head through and grab \"&lt;a href=\"The%20Trial%20of%20the%20True%20Path\"&gt;The Trial of the True Path&lt;/a&gt;\". Another book, \"&lt;a href=\"The%20Hidden%20Trials\"&gt;The Hidden Trials&lt;/a&gt;\", can be found in the Armory on the other side. \nHead along the path to the north to start the Trial of Air. Use the Sands of True Sight to reveal the path forward, then once you are on the other side of the cliff, head to the left and onto the next cliff where you can use the sands. Create another bridge using the sands, and then another after you find yourself on a small piece of land again. These bridges can be hard to see, so pay close attention lest you fall off to your death. After the third bridge, you have cleared the Trial of Air. \nHead back to just after the first bridge, but turn right this time. You will find another chasm there; it does not matter if you no longer have the Sands of True Sight here, as the bridge is just straight ahead with no twists or turns. Proceed ahead to find the final book, guarded by &lt;a href=\"Birdmaster%20Dehanar\"&gt;Birdmaster Dehanar&lt;/a&gt; and fout &lt;a href=\"Bird%20of%20Prey\"&gt;Birds of Prey&lt;/a&gt;. Once they are dead, loot Dehanar's inventory to find the book \"&lt;a href=\"The%20Trial%20of%20Air\"&gt;The Trial of Air&lt;/a&gt;\". Now that you have all four books, head east from the training grounds until you find the library. Head inside; you will find four empty book stands alongside stands for the books \"&lt;a href=\"The%20Trial%20of%20Fire\"&gt;The Trial of Fire&lt;/a&gt;\" and \"&lt;a href=\"The%20Trial%20of%20Martial%20Knowledge\"&gt;The Trial of Martial Knowledge&lt;/a&gt;\". place the books on the stands and the path ahead will open. Head ahead into the Master's Study and face off against &lt;a href=\"Master%20Abrunul\"&gt;Master Abrunul&lt;/a&gt; to complete the Trial of Martial Knowledge. He will havefour disciples with him, so kill those first. the master himself likes to dart around the room, so take heed of that. \nOnce all three of thesetrials have been completed, a trap door in the library will open up. head through and start your final trial, the Trial of the True Path. You will see a light called the Guardian of the True Path; activate it and it will guide your way through the darkness ahead. Enemies will occasionally appear along this path; the light will not stop and wait until they are defeated, but it will move slowly enough to allow the combat to take place. At the end of the path, the betrayer &lt;a href=\"Abelazar\"&gt;Abelazar&lt;/a&gt; awaits, alongside two snakes. Kill the snakes forst to make the fight against Abelazar himself easier. About halfway through the fight, the Guardian of the True Path will appear and summon a damaging mist around the arena, but the area around the spirit herself will be safe. Keep Abelazar in the mist while you are in the safe zone, and he will take a lot of damage. \nOnce Abelazar lies dead, head through the portal back to the entrance and speak with the spirit of &lt;a href=\"Master%20Timen\"&gt;Master Timen&lt;/a&gt;. He will tell you that the spirits here will not find true rest until &lt;a href=\"The%20Serpent%20%28Celestial%29\"&gt;the Serpent&lt;/a&gt; himself is defeated. Head outside and talk to Fada to finish the quest."}

And for three spans of a person's life all the &lt;a href=\"Redguards%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Redguard&lt;/a&gt;s did delve and build, and many were the Great Works that were erected above the sands. And few did study the &lt;a href=\"Way%20of%20the%20Sword\"&gt;Way of the Sword&lt;/a&gt;, for all were constructing monuments to the greatness of our people.\nNow east of the &lt;a href=\"Alik%27r%20Desert%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Alik'r&lt;/a&gt; and south of the &lt;a href=\"Bankorai%20Pass\"&gt;Pass of Bangkorai&lt;/a&gt; the ever-laudable Queen &lt;a href=\"Ojwa\"&gt;Ojwa&lt;/a&gt; did cause to have built a city of splendor, all white stone and fluted columns, and the city was named &lt;a href=\"Ojwambu\"&gt;Ojwambu&lt;/a&gt;, after its thrh rousing and restful. And all was pleasing thereby.ice-eminent monarch. And its streets and broad avenues were replete with houses and halls devoted to all the arts, both mercantile and inspirational. The people strolled the streets bedecked in fine garments and bedizened with bright jewels, and partaking of delicate viands and hearkening to tunes both rousing and restful. And all was pleasing thereby.\nIn an unconsidered corner in the shadow of the walls stood the city's &lt;a href=\"Hall%20of%20the%20Virtues%20of%20War\"&gt;Hall of the Virtues of War&lt;/a&gt;, and there did the worthy &lt;a href=\"Hallin\"&gt;Hallin&lt;/a&gt;, being the Last of the &lt;a href=\"Ansei\"&gt;Ansei&lt;/a&gt;, teach such of Ojwambu's youth as were yet so inclined the Way of the Sword. Now these youths were few, and though they suffered raillery and unkind badinage from their peers, they found the aging &lt;a href=\"Hallin\"&gt;Hallin&lt;/a&gt; an inspiration nonetheless, and learned the Way of the Sword until they became true Redguard warriors. And this was well, as you shall see.\nFor in the &lt;a href=\"Dragontail%20Mountains\"&gt;mountain range called Dragon's-Tail&lt;/a&gt; the tusk-folk still lurked, beating their breasts and rending their ragged garments in rage and grievance against the Redguards. And among them was a great Goblin Warlord who had escaped the Curse of &lt;a href=\"Divad%20Hunding\"&gt;Divad&lt;/a&gt; through a chicanery, and thus had not been diminished. This giant &lt;a href=\"Goblin\"&gt;Goblin&lt;/a&gt; was possessed of both slyness and sinew, and long he worked among the tribes of Dragon's-Tail, until one day he awoke to find himself Warlord of all the tusk-folk therein. And his name was &lt;a href=\"Mahgzoor%20Rockhand\"&gt;Mahgzoor Rockhand&lt;/a&gt;. So &lt;a href=\"Mahgzoor\"&gt;Mahgzoor&lt;/a&gt; raised his great blade &lt;a href=\"Bone-Hewer\"&gt;Bone-Hewer&lt;/a&gt;, and roared in a mighty voice like an earthquake, and declared that the day of vengeance at last was at hand.\nThen Mahgzoor led his &lt;a href=\"Endwise%20Army\"&gt;Endwise Army&lt;/a&gt; down from the Dragon's-Tail, and it swept into Hammerfell like a great sandstorm, and none could stand before it. The people of the Fallen Waste fled before the fury of the tusk-folk, and many and many were those who sought refuge behind the walls of Ojwambu, until the city was overfilled thereby. The citizens cried out in distress and apprehension, saying, \"Who will fight for us, O Queen Ojwa? For we have become artisans and pleasance-wrights, and have forgotten the Way of the Sword.\"\nAnd Queen Ojwa spake, saying, \"Are there none among us who remember the Way of the Sword?\" Then venerable Hallin stepped forward and bowed before his monarch, saying, \"I remember the Way of the Sword, O My Queen, or at least as much as I may, for I am the Last Ansei. What I can do, I shall.\"\nHallin's students then stepped forward as well, and laid their swords at the feet of their queen. But the thrice-eminent Ojwa was dismayed by their fewness, and spake distraught, saying, \"How shall we repel the Endwise Army with so few blades? For the tusk-folk are as numberless as the sand in the dunes.\"\nBut Hallin was nowise deterred, and said boldly, \"Take heart, O Illustrious Majesty. For your people are Redguards, which means they come easily to the Way of the Sword, and once they have their hands once again on the hilts of blades, and learn to quote once more from the &lt;a href=\"Book%20of%20Circles\"&gt;Book of Circles&lt;/a&gt;, they will be a match for any folk in all the round world, be they ever so numberless.\"\n\"Be that as it may, venerable Ansei,\" replied Queen Ojwa, \"but even Redguards need time to learn the Way of the Sword, and of time we have but little.\"\n\"Then you must have more. Finding you a store of time shall be my task, the culmination of the work of my life, and I swear upon &lt;a href=\"Onsi\"&gt;Onsi&lt;/a&gt;'s bright blade you shall have it.\" And he drew his blade, yea, even in the presence of the queen, and swore an oath upon the Brotherhood and Sisterhood of the Blade. And behold, Hallin seemed to grow to the stature of a giant, and a light shone from his blade's sharp edge, and all were obliged to avert their gaze.\nYet when they were able to look once more, they saw naught but the venerable Hallin, smiling and sheathing his blade. And the Last Ansei raised his hands, as if to embrace all the people of Ojwambu, and said, \"Fellow Redguards, to you I bequeath the knowledge of the Book of Circles, which we have guarded long and well, that you may be equal to all threats whatsoever. These my students shall teach you their learning, and in good time you will all know once more the Way of the Sword.\"\nHe turned then to Queen Ojwa and said, \"Now lead your people, O Mighty Monarch, for that is what you do best. Take them to the west, and spread the word of the Way of the Sword, that Hammerfell might make itself ready for the Endwise Army. I shall abide here in your city, which I and the other Ansei shall defend so long as we may, until our people are ready to fight for themselves.\""}

But Queen Ojwa did more: as she was a wise queen she was an Owl-Friend, and had decreed that all owls were to bthe queen did call the Father of Owls, and asked him toe honored and none slain. And in return the owls did many a favor for her. So the queen did call the Father of Owls, and asked him to bide in &lt;a href=\"Ojwambu\"&gt;Ojwambu&lt;/a&gt; and observe Hallin's defense. \"For I would learn,\" she said, \"how one man shall defend a city entire.\"\nEven as the last of the people of Ojwambu departed from her gates to take the secret ways to Alik'r, the scouts of the tusk-folk appeared in the east, where they were noted by Hallin, for though he was old, his eyes were keen.\nThen Hallin spake, though there was none to hear but the Father of Owls, saying, \"As the snake sheds its skin, so shall the &lt;a href=\"Ansei\"&gt;Ansei&lt;/a&gt; rise anew from the husks of the past.\" He raised his sword and cried, \"Sisters! Brothers! I summon you to the succor of your people, for time folds upon itself, and then-time is now.\"\nAnd he gestured with his blade to the left, and all along the battlements to the north there was a rustling as of snakeskins, and lo: there arose along the parapets the shadows of a legion. And there stood the semblances of all the female Ansei who ever were, and they turned to Hallin and saluted. So Hallin gestured likewise to the right, and along the battlements to the south there was a rustling, and lo: there arose the semblances of all the male Ansei who ever were. And they likewise saluted Hallin, and then all, north and south, drew their bright blades, and stood on the battlements awaiting.\nThe scouts of the tusk-folk stopped forthwith to observe the defenses of Ojwambu. Surprised were they to see the battlements lined with goodly warriors, for they had been told that the folk of the city had forgot the Way of the Sword. So they did consult among themselves as to who would carry this news to Warlord &lt;a href=\"Mahzgoor%20Rockhand\"&gt;Mahzgoor&lt;/a&gt;, and quarrel and quibble, for they feared the bearer of such news would have his head struck off. But finally the smallest, with many blows, was made to carry the report back to the Warlord.\nSo the scout reported to Mahzgoor that, unaccountably, the walls of Ojwambu were lined with many goodly defenders. Of an instant the Rockhand struck off the scout's head, but then he took thought, for he was possessed of both slyness and sinew. And his thoughts were, \"What matter? We are as numberless as the sand in the dunes. We shall surround this Ojwambu, leaving neither entry nor egress. We shall despoil their fields of its provender, and stop up the streams of their flow, until no one within shall have to eat or to drink. And thus the city shall fall.\"\nSo Mahzgoor ordered, and so it came to pass. The tusk-folk took their leisure among the spoils of the outworks, casting jeers and taunts at the defenders on the walls. But the defenders replied naught. So Mahzgoor and his army waited, amusing themselves most abominably at the expense of their prisoners, secure that in time the defenders of Ojwambu must wither and dwindle.\nBut it was not so. Even long after when the Warlord's bone-counters calculated there must be no more to eat or to drink within the city, the defenders stood still stalwart and saying naught. So Mahzgoor summoned his shamans, saying, \"Shamans! Have we been befooled by the perfidious &lt;a href=\"Redguards%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Redguard&lt;/a&gt;s? Are these goodly warriors we see lining the battlements, or are they but shadows?\"\nSo the shamans cast the portents, and sacrificed twin infants, and sent a scullion to the East Gate whom Hallin did spear from above. And they returned and said, \"Nay, mighty Mahzgoor, we are not befooled, for these are goodly warriors we see lining the battlements. But how they may stand when they have not to eat or to drink, this we cannot tell.\"\nOf an instant Mahzgoor struck off the shamans' heads, then raised bloody Bone-Hewer and cried, \"To arms! Form ranks! For tonight we drink the blood of the defenders of Ojwambu!\"\nOf that battle, no living Redguard survived to tell the tale. But nonetheless did wise Queen Ojwa hear of it in full, for the Father of Owls did bear the tale to her ear. He told of how Hallin and his Ansei withstood the assault, yea, for seventeen days. But though they were goodly warriors, over time the Ansei did dwindle, though each left behind only a husk like unto a snakeskin. Finally only Hallin stood at the East Gate, which was burst open by Warlord Mahzgoor with Bone-Hewer held high. And Hallin did seem to grow to match him in size, and the two met sword to sword.\nLong and long their blades clashed, until finally as the moons rose the Rockhand smote Hallin such a blow that he was struck to the ground. But even as he fell Hallin, who knew the cuts and thrusts of the Book of Circles, yea, each and every one, swung his sword and struck off the head of the Warlord Mahzgoor. Then both were dead, but in death only one was smiling and serene.\nQueen Ojwa nodded to hear this news, and said, \"It is well.\" And she turned to her mighty army of Redguard warriors, each of which knew the cuts and thrusts of the Book of Circles, yea, each and every one, and said, \"Redguards! March we now to retake our lands from the tusk-folk. And when we have regained our splendid city once more, we shall rename it Hallin's Stand. And so it shall be.\"\nAnd so it has been, ever after."}

But my job has always been to keep King Ranser's records, and that hasn't changed\u2014at least in my mind\u2014with our new state of being. I'm getting ahead of myself. My pardons. Allow me to start at the beginning.\nAfter almost a year of conflict, &lt;a href=\"High%20King%20Emeric%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Emeric&lt;/a&gt; and his allies had driven King Ranser's forces to the brink of defeat. We prepared to make our final stand at &lt;a href=\"Markwasten%20Moor\"&gt;Markwasten Moor&lt;/a&gt;, caught as we were between a Breton armada and Orc troops. I am sure that history will describe how King Ranser fell that day, but history would be wrong. An entirely different fate befell the liege of &lt;a href=\"Wayrest%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Wayrest&lt;/a&gt;.\nIt is true that the bulk of King Ranser's army was annihilated at the battle on the moor. But Ranser was able to escape with a small contingent of soldiers and aides and make his way to the top of a nameless tor overlooking the shattered city of Shornhelm.\nIt was on this tor that King Ranser put his ultimate plan into motion to defeat King Emeric and his dastardly allies. Using an arcane ritual provided by the court magician, &lt;a href=\"Reezal-Jul\"&gt;Reezal-Jul&lt;/a&gt;, the brilliant King Ranser transformed his most loyal and devoted soldiers into a force that would stand for the ages. The final step in the ritual required a blood sacrifice, however. When King Ranser's traitorous general\u2014whose name shall never again be spoken and who shall forever be forgotten\u2014murdered his own liege, it was royal blood that ignited the ritual and triggered our change.\nI must admit that my less-than-regal mind has yet to fully fathom the intricacies of King Ranser's plan. His ritual turned us all into &lt;a href=\"undead%20%28Online%29\"&gt;undead&lt;/a&gt; soldiers, skeletal immortals who can stand at his side for eternity. But instead of immediately striking out and attacking Emeric's forces, King Ranser ordered us to strengthen our position and prepare to defend the tor.\n\"This tor shall be my throne!\" King Ranser proclaimed. \"From here, I shall rule for eternity!\"\nAnd now you know the true fate of King Ranser and his loyal soldiers. My time as scribe is finished, for my liege needs every sword at the ready. I will leave this record, safe in this tower until the day comes that King Ranser orders us to march from the tor and back into Shornhelm."}

In the &lt;a href=\"Battle%20of%20Red%20Mountain\"&gt;Battle of Red Mountain&lt;/a&gt;, warriors of House Redoran died bravely for their duty to the Tribunal.

For without the divine, we would not have the chance to serve. And without divine law, we would not know right from wrong. And without giving thanks for these things, we would forget place and our purpose.\nGreat House Redoran praises all the skills of war. Not because we believe war is good or honorable in its own right, but because this knowledge is necessary to perform one's duty.

A noble of House Redoran is expected to know how to &lt;a href=\"Armorer%20%28Morrowind%29\"&gt;repair and maintain&lt;/a&gt; his own armor.\nThose who are born to House Redoran have been taught their skill and virtues by kin and clan. Those who seek to enter House Redoran as retainers must satisfy an examiner in the Redoran Council Hall that their skills are suitable for service to House Redoran.\nWhether born to the blood of House Redoran, or adopted into service of House Redoran by oath, those who seek to advance in the ranks of House Redoran must demonstrate their virtues by service and obedience.

It brings me no joy to cast aspersions on his name. Caprenius was once an eminent scholar whose mastery of beastly sciences far surpassed that of his peers. Alas, his obsession with the bull-men and their dubious origins proved too much for the community to bear. Allow me to clarify this matter and put it to rest once and for all.\nCaprenius, clearly in the throes of some mania, suggests that &lt;a href=\"Minotaur%20%28Online%29\"&gt;minotaurs&lt;/a&gt; are the descendants of Alessia and her legendary consort Morihaus, the bull-man. Beyond being lightly heretical, this assertion finds no basis in historical fact.

He met his fate at the biting-tips of Elven spears. That much is certain. Connecting the Slave-Queen to a brutish race of bull-headed savages merely because they share a physical feature makes no more sense that connecting men to guars since we both walk on two legs.\nThe fact is that minotaurs are the bitter fruit of some spell or alchemical process gone awry. There is no great conspiracy\u2014no zealously guarded secret\u2014just an unfortunate, ghastly accident. Truly, who could look at one of these bovine brutes and see the proud legacy of &lt;a href=\"Akatosh\"&gt;Akatosh&lt;/a&gt; stirring in their blood? These are the ravings of a disturbed mind, and should be treated as such.\nTake my advice\u2014when you see a minotaur, don't inquire about its noble lineage. If you wish to survive the encounter, kill it or flee."}

Selliel saw the three tiny does behind him. She froze. Then the buck walked calmly toward her and nudged the bow away.\nSelliel hesitantly put her hand out. The buck licked her palm gently. Then it snorted and walked back to the forest. The does followed the buck. Selliel did not.\nShe returned to the cliff top. The wolf was where she had left it, untouched by scavengers. She skinned it, harvested its meat, and stuffed it into her pack. Then she began the long walk home."}

According to the calculations, the random sequence learned very cunningly that fragmentation reserved itself to the left eye. Variation realms were the evidence needed.\nThere was the Biting, which broke the twelve worlds and their name-eggs, and the Biters chewed new names of the lesser serpents until soon death was known to the smallest and your alphabets disappeared but ours did not. The state of rest became worthy of blame, however segmented, so heat was wasted across the right eye. And in mercy we gave to you language that was dead yet walking if you used it, which you did, though transient food-forms became problematic.\nThere was the Slithering, when scales were now name-bites that moved freely, and the dead language speakers bled out into non-talk, which is egg-naming inverted, which slides into the shedding of more dead, which cannot be redeemed in the hunger quadrant, and now we could no more be detached, for the twelve-to-one only talked unsense except for us, who ate your slithering during trumpet season as the Biters poisoned the random sequence until we came and made of it music, as that is the only thing that might save the prey who wore all shapes of confusion not described yet in the calculations. Some of us discovered honor, though more found the idea of moderation, which turned into the identical selection process and we created our eating that way.\nThere was the Shedding, who inflated into a sphere of edible communications and this is how the sequence began to find proportion again. The name-eggs that had survived without also turning into calculation powder settled and became dreugh-waters, which was the first thing to finally encompass the risks attempted by the Striking. Stomach signals wrote a complex document of conditions. This was the variation map, called dai.\nThe Reaching came, where movements of dai progressed across islands of edible communication and food-forms could stockpile. One Reaching unravelled but the Coiling at its belly made a virtual star line, which made eating lucid. We slid to the imago and Named it cunningly. The waters obeyed and dead names took up their place in the random sequence. The first serpents returned to us in transmissions that answered the alphabet-virus which we then consumed at last. By the relative dai, we egg-named it and swallowed all source-information to preserve the virus and became immortal thereby. Past the star line, dead-talking continued.\nThe Laying then happened, and we moved into forms that had been granted from the source information of the first serpents, which was gold-walking, which is pattern. The scales became intertwined in the random sequence with music that ate forever, which we fed with you. Low forms created a seeking egg but we fed it to the music, too. Then the Biter-Shedding grew sideways into the reception field and knew a Coiling and mastery was ours borne from the calculations. The final name was Tsaescence and we ate it to become it and there are no more variations."}

This requires diligence, discipline, and most importantly, humility. The true historian must be willing to admit error and revise their accounts when new evidence comes to light.\nOne of the most pernicious traps for new historians is reliance on supporting accounts\u2014that is, the belief that if multiple writers detail the same event in the same way, those accounts are more likely to be true. In point of fact, we should assume the opposite. Societal pressures and widespread cultural delusions often result in identical historical accounts. For example, &lt;a href=\"Nede%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Nedic&lt;/a&gt; texts often reference an event called the \"Autumn of Snakes.\" According to the histories, hundreds of snakes (many the size of mammoths) emerged from the ground and devoured whole towns before finally being subdued by the Nede spear-maiden, Ranev the Coal-Eyed Wanderer. Nedic scholars describe the Autumn in meticulous and near-identical detail, and yet, we now know that the event is completely apocryphal.\nIt's not that the writers are deliberately lying (though that is sometimes the case). In all likelihood, ancient historians were trying their best to describe events faithfully. Unfortunately, they did not have the linguistic tools or scholarly sophistication to give a truthful account. For that reason, we must take a long hard look at any tales that are widely accepted, but also seem hyperbolic. We must also look for \"recurring calamities\"\u2014that is, events that purportedly happened the same way, but in vastly different locales and time periods.\nThe most obvious example of the \"recurring calamity\" is the tale of the disappearing island. &lt;a href=\"Tamrielic\"&gt;Tamrielic&lt;/a&gt; history is littered with sinking, hidden, or disappearing islands. &lt;a href=\"Yokuda\"&gt;Yokuda&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Pyandonea\"&gt;Pyandonea&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Artaeum%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Artaeum&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Dranil%20Kir\"&gt;Dranil Kir&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Eyevea\"&gt;Eyevea&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Thras\"&gt;Thras&lt;/a&gt;, and (perhaps most importantly) &lt;a href=\"Aldmeris\"&gt;Aldmeris&lt;/a&gt;. The cause of the disappearance is almost always magical in nature\u2014often the result of some act of hubris or a desire for secrecy. Of course, this all begs the question: are any of these tales true? I have my doubts.\nLet us examine the mythical \"sinking\" islands: Yokuda, Thras, and Aldmeris. Each island was the ancestral home of its resident race, and in all three cases, foes or fate destroyed the island as punishment for some act of hubris. In the case of the &lt;a href=\"Redguards%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Redguards&lt;/a&gt;, foolish sword-singers sundered the Yokudan Isles with a forbidden sword stroke. The warriors of the All-Flags Navy drove the &lt;a href=\"Sload\"&gt;Sload&lt;/a&gt; and their island of Thras into the sea as punishment for the &lt;a href=\"Thrassian%20Plague\"&gt;Thrassian Plague&lt;/a&gt;. And our forebears, the &lt;a href=\"Aldmer\"&gt;Aldmer&lt;/a&gt;, fled the Isle of Aldmeris to avoid some mysterious calamity\u2014likely the result of our fall from &lt;a href=\"Aedric\"&gt;Aedric&lt;/a&gt; grace.\nNow, a novice historian would likely take these tales at face value. \"If multiple histories say the island sank, it must have sunk!\" But I entreat you to look deeper. Could it be that the \"sinking island\" is not a literal event, but rather, a metaphorical one?\nThras, Yokuda, and Aldmeris are much more than simple landmasses; they are societal symbols\u2014avatars for a cultural identity lost in time. So stories about the sundering or sinking of these islands may be a trick of the light\u2014a poet's attempt at explaining the pain of forgotten origins. Did an entire continent drown as a result of a sword stroke? Did our ancestors travel to &lt;a href=\"Summerset%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Summerset&lt;/a&gt; from a mystical half-Aedric isle? I think not. These lost islands rest at the fault-line between fact and parable. There is truth in those tales, certainly, but the true historian knows that not all truth is literal."}

He will also give the Hero the &lt;a href=\"Arrow%20of%20Extrication%20%28Item%29\"&gt;Arrow of Extrication&lt;/a&gt;, which supposedly should unlock something.\nWalkthrough.\nAs preparation, it is recommended bring a &lt;a href=\"Bows%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;bow&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Torch%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;torches&lt;/a&gt;, a few arrows and plenty of &lt;a href=\"Lockpick%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;lockpicks&lt;/a&gt;. The &lt;a href=\"Skeleton%20Key%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;Skeleton Key&lt;/a&gt;, received from &lt;a href=\"Nocturnal\"&gt;Nocturnal&lt;/a&gt;, is also very useful to have if already acquired. If the Hero is a &lt;a href=\"Marksman%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;bowman&lt;/a&gt;, make sure to also bring &lt;a href=\"Silver%20Arrow%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;silver arrows&lt;/a&gt;, and leave behind the least needed items if one wishes.\nImperial City.\nFirst, go to the Imperial City Palace in the &lt;a href=\"Imperial%20City%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;Imperial City&lt;/a&gt;. Head inside, make a left and pick the lock on the door to the Palace Basement. Once inside, walk a few feet, turn right, and head to the other end of the room (north side); watch out for a patrolling guard. Activate the giant hourglass, the &lt;a href=\"Glass%20of%20Time\"&gt;Glass of Time&lt;/a&gt; to unlock the 'Old Way' escape tunnel. This step is optional, due to a game glitch that will allow the Hero to enter the sewers regardless, however the map will not update unless the hero activates the Glass of Time. \nThen, go back the way you came and head to the &lt;a href=\"Imperial%20City%2C%20Arboretum\"&gt;Arboretum&lt;/a&gt; and continue to the northeastern gate. A grate on the ground by a tree is the entrance to the South East Tunnels. Inside, go on to the Beneath the Bloodworks area.\nBeware of &lt;a href=\"Vampire%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;vampires&lt;/a&gt; throughout this area, as well as several other &lt;a href=\"Creatures%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;creatures&lt;/a&gt;. If you contract &lt;a href=\"Porphyric%20Hemophilia%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;Porphyric Hemophilia&lt;/a&gt;, seek a cure immediately, using a cure disease potion or pray at a city chapel. Once arriving at a set of stairs, make a right, continue to go straight, and then find the a door on the left. Open the gates with nearby turn wheels to get to the Imperial Palace Sewers.\nOnce inside the Sewers, cross the bridge and head down the stairs. Watch out for the &lt;a href=\"Wraith%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;Wraiths&lt;/a&gt; in this area. Go through the northwest hall and the Hero will come to a large circular room with a pool of water. Go through the hallway to the next room, then go through the next hallway and through the gate. Head through the Strange Door to the Old Way, using the Glass of Time.\nThe Old Way.\nIn the Old Way, watch the ground carefully for traps. The ruins are populated with leveled &lt;a href=\"Undead%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;undead&lt;/a&gt;. Go down the hall, then make a left and go through the door into another room called Old Way. Be cautious, as more enemies will appear, mostly skeletal and Ethereal Undead. Slay them, go through the rooms and corridors and then go towards and enter The Lost Catacombs. If it is difficult to find, look for the hole in the wall, climb through and there will be two zombies.\nAgain, fight or sneak through; there is only one way to go. Head north, then east through a large area with a few enemies in the lighted center, then north again. When arriving at two tunnels, take the right one. Follow it through to reach a large elvish-origin room. Use the Springheel Jak Boots to get on the ledge, which will activate the switches to open the first gate. Continue ahead and go through the door to the Hall of Epochs.\nInside the Hall of Epochs, go straight up the steps to the three statues. There will be a message that the Hero will need to find the keyhole. Go around back to the large walls, which are similar looking to pillars, to get a message needed to lower the walls. Face south and head through the gate, then press the button found there. Then, continue until another room named the Hall of Epochs is reached.\nIn the room, push the button to open the secret wall to the south east. In the last chamber, where there are two catacomb rooms on each side, there will be a chest and a button above it. Press it, then head back to the large room with the statues. Note that it may be necessary to return to the push button over the chest if both walls do not go down together.\nOnce the big walls are down, fight the two zombies who will appear. Afterwords, stand on the square on the small bridge, looking straight across at the big center statue a hole to shoot arrows through (the keyhole). Aim directly at the statue's nose for a perfect bulls-eye. However, it is recommended to practice with a few regular arrows first.\nWhen hitting the hole with an arrow, a loud \"thunk\" sound will be heard that marks a hit. Aiming for the hilt of the statue's sword may help with hitting the keyhole. Saving first before shooting the &lt;a href=\"Arrow%20of%20Extrication%20%28Item%29\"&gt;Arrow of Extrication&lt;/a&gt; is recommended.\nOnce the Hero approaches the door, the two &lt;a href=\"Ayleid%20Guardian%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;statues&lt;/a&gt; will come alive and will become aggressive if interacted with. Defeat them, then &lt;a href=\"Sneak%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;sneak&lt;/a&gt; through the door back to the palace. It is recommended to save your game at this point.\nImperial Palace.\nThe Hero will end up in the Imperial Palace Guard Room, where four guards are sleeping regardless of the time of day. They will awaken immediately and automatically change into full armor, even with a Sneak level over 100. There are several ways to handle this: use chameleon spells/potions, invisibility spells/potions (however, the effect will wear off the moment you interact with anything - including opening doors), or kill the Palace Guards and earn a bounty. Using &lt;a href=\"Frenzy%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;frenzy&lt;/a&gt; or summoning spells on the guards will help level the playing field for the hero, as an additional guard will run in from the hall, presumably due to the sound of combat, so the hero will have to battle five simultaneously.\nSneak out and make a left into the Library, following the pathway up (the left door goes to the &lt;a href=\"Elder%20Council\"&gt;Elder Council&lt;/a&gt; Chambers and requires a key). Sneak forward to reach a door to the library on the left. Pick the lock on the door, enter and make a right, then follow the hallway. Pull the lever behind the &lt;a href=\"Blind%20Moth%20Priest\"&gt;blind priest&lt;/a&gt;, and go back around to the front of the priest gate and into the library.\nSit on the chair. Beware, if the Hero tries to talk to the blind priests, they will raise the alarm and will have to escape the palace without the scroll. It is advisable to save frequently, as failure will require a replay through the entire quest.\nA Blind Priest will come down and give the Hero the Elder Scroll. Do not talk to any of the priests, as they will not give over the scroll and the quest can't be finished. Look far enough around to bring up the cross hair and activate it so the Hero can read and then take the Elder Scroll.\nSave at this point: PS3 users may encounter a quest-breaking bug during the next steps.\nSneak up the stairs. The priests may not notice, even if the Hero is directly in front of them. Pick the lock, then make a left and pick another lock, leading into the Moth Priest's Chambers. Go around and pick the lock to the Imperial Battlemage\u2019s Chambers. It may seem advisable to look around and loot if one desires, as the Hero won't be able to go back here again.\nThere, the Hero might run into &lt;a href=\"Evangeline%20Beanique\"&gt;Evangeline Beanique&lt;/a&gt; wearing a red velvet blouse and pants. She is a member of the &lt;a href=\"Mages%20Guild%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;Mages Guild&lt;/a&gt;; &lt;a href=\"pickpocket\"&gt;pickpocket&lt;/a&gt;ing her may result in expulsion if the Hero is a member and is caught. The bloodprice will be taken off by the Gray Fox. Pick the lock into the bedroom, and make sure to wear the &lt;a href=\"Boots%20of%20Springheel%20Jak%20%28Item%29\"&gt;Boots of Springheel Jak&lt;/a&gt; to better handle the upcoming falls.\nGo to the fireplace and escape through there, then fall to the Old Way. Some guides mention getting arrested as the easy way out. Do \"not\" get arrested. This can cause a quest-breaking glitch, causing the quest not to update past the point of being discovered. Regardless, the Hero can keep the boots of Springheel Jak (high Agility required). Alternatively, an extremely high Acrobatics skill will make the falling damage tolerable (potions, spells, and scrolls to increase acrobatics are all very helpful. Any gear besides the Boots that can increase acrobatics also works, but be sure to save before you try this method).\nOnce fallen down, return to the Gray Fox with the scroll. He will ask the Hero of one last favor before the reward: take a Wedding Ring to &lt;a href=\"Countess%20Millona%20Umbranox\"&gt;Countess Millona Umbranox&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Anvil%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;Anvil&lt;/a&gt; and gauge her reaction. If she asks who it is from, respond by saying it is from a stranger who wants them to have it.\nRevelation at Castle Anvil.\nHead to &lt;a href=\"Castle%20Anvil\"&gt;Castle Anvil&lt;/a&gt; and give the wedding ring to her. She will discover that it is her husband's ring and that she deeply misses him. The Stranger will walk up, and will turn into the Gray Fox. He will take off his mask, and reveal that he is &lt;a href=\"Count%20Corvus%20Umbranox\"&gt;Count Corvus Umbranox&lt;/a&gt;, her long-lost husband.\nHe wore the mask ten years ago when it was inherited from the former Thieves Guild guildmaster, and lost his identity for that decade. Corvus will then renounce his life of thievery, and name the Hero the new guildmaster, giving them the no longer cursed &lt;a href=\"Gray%20Cowl%20of%20Nocturnal%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;Gray Cowl of Nocturnal&lt;/a&gt;. Wearing it in public will cause guards to attack, however, others will not recognize that they are the Gray Fox if the mask is removed in front of them.\nCorvus also reveals that &lt;a href=\"Emer%20Dareloth\"&gt;Emer Dareloth&lt;/a&gt; is the true thief of Nocturnal's cowl. History, having been altered by the magic of the Cowl, now allows the Thieves Guild to have a &lt;a href=\"Dareloth%27s%20Basement\"&gt;guildhall&lt;/a&gt; at the ruins of Dareloth's house at the &lt;a href=\"Imperial%20City%20Waterfront\"&gt;Imperial City Waterfront&lt;/a&gt;, where the Hero first met &lt;a href=\"Armand%20Christophe\"&gt;Armand&lt;/a&gt;."}

Zurin Arctus, as the Underking, is associated with &lt;a href=\"Magnus\"&gt;Magnus&lt;/a&gt;. The Underking also hid the &lt;a href=\"Ring%20of%20Khajiit\"&gt;Ring of Khajiit&lt;/a&gt; in a dark abyss in an unspecified time period.\nDescription.\n\"A possibly mythical entity who has been the subject of horror stories for hundreds of years. A group of mages and undead creatures wander the land, claiming to be Agents of the Underking.\"\nZurin Arctus.\n&lt;a href=\"Second%20Era\"&gt;Second Era&lt;/a&gt;.\nZurin Arctus was the Imperial Battlemage during the time of Tiber Septim, as well as a tactician, who authored a book on War Magic. Zurin Arctus also performed major research on the &lt;a href=\"Numidium\"&gt;Numidium&lt;/a&gt; following its capture as a result of the Armistice with Morrowind, discovering the reasoning as to why the Numidium was made, and its potential. He also learns the role of Ysmir Wulfharth in the War. However, Arctus was convinced he needed the &lt;a href=\"Heart%20of%20Lorkhan\"&gt;Heart of Lorkhan&lt;/a&gt; to fuel the Numidium, and was, as such, working on incomplete plans. Arctus was also the person responsible for the creation of the &lt;a href=\"Totem%20of%20Tiber%20Septim\"&gt;Totem of Tiber Septim&lt;/a&gt;, which was crafted at the order of the Emperor himself, and which was required to control the Numidium. In order to ensure that only those of Tiber Septim's bloodline could access the Numidium, Arctus placed a seal on it, disabling everyone from using the Numidium unless they were of Tiber Septim's line, or possessed a special supernatural affinity. Those who would try to use the Numidium without the requirements of the Totem, would be killed.\nAfter Wulfharth was ambushed, Zurin Arctus, the Imperial Guard, and Wulfharth himself were all killed, after which Tiber Septim strolled in and took the Mantella, believed to be the heart of the Imperial battlemage. Others state that the Mantella was infused with the life force of the Imperial Battlemage, and that with the power of the artifact, Septim crushed all those who stood in his way. Yet others also state that Tiber Septim betrayed Zurin Arctus, and that when the Battlemage died, his soul refused to leave his body, resulting in him turning into the undead Underking.\nAfter the Summerset Isles were conquered, Tiber Septim started using the Numidium to crush neutral royal families in Tamriel, and replace them with those more loyal to himself. Zurin Arctus became furious at this use of the Numidium, fought to reclaim the Mantella. In the process, both the Numidium and the Battlemage were destroyed, with the Mantella being blown into &lt;a href=\"Aetherius\"&gt;Aetherius&lt;/a&gt;, and the Numidium's body being scattered and falling into the sea. Following this, Zurin Arctus became the Underking, with his agents being dedicated to find the Mantella. Even so, there remains uncertainty as to whether or not the Mantella was the heart of Tiber Septim or the heart of the battlemage.\nWhen Zurin Arctus had arisen not long afterwards, he took his first revenge against Tiber Septim by cursing the holy catacombs of &lt;a href=\"Sancre%20Tor\"&gt;Sancre Tor&lt;/a&gt;. Tiber Septim sent out the four mightiest of his Blades to investigate the scene, Rielus, Valdimar, Alain and Casnar. When the &lt;a href=\"Blades\"&gt;Blades&lt;/a&gt; arrived, the Underking defeated them and ensnared them within Sancre Tor, cursing them to roam the catacombs as skeletons, binding them to forever guard the defiled shrine of Tiber Septim. Since then, the Underking has been recovering in a crypt within High Rock.\n&lt;a href=\"Third%20Era\"&gt;Third Era&lt;/a&gt;.\nDuring the &lt;a href=\"Imperial%20Simulacrum\"&gt;Imperial Simulacrum&lt;/a&gt;, it was said that the Underking held a Necromancer agent known as &lt;a href=\"Golthog\"&gt;Golthog&lt;/a&gt; at &lt;a href=\"Stonekeep%20%28Location%29\"&gt;Stonekeep&lt;/a&gt;.\nPrior to the Warp in the West, the Underking had been a thorn in the side of Mannimarco for centuries. When the Necromancers tried to trick the Blades by providing them with a cursed artifact, the Underking sent out his agents to contact &lt;a href=\"The%20Agent\"&gt;the Agent&lt;/a&gt; of the Emperor, in an attempt to retrieve the cursed artifact. The kidnapping of Prince &lt;a href=\"Arthago\"&gt;Arthago&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"Sentinel\"&gt;Sentinel&lt;/a&gt; was also often attributed to the Underking, a claim which the Underking's agents tried to disprove.\nDuring the Warp in the West, the Underking's spy network was said to have been very extensive. At the end of the &lt;a href=\"Warp%20in%20the%20West\"&gt;Warp in the West&lt;/a&gt; the Underking obtained the &lt;a href=\"Mantella\"&gt;Mantella&lt;/a&gt; and used it to reunite himself with his heart, finding peace after countless years of being undead. In the process, he created an anti-magic zone of several miles radius around that area. When the Bay Kings or Gortwog obtained the Numidium, the Underking destroyed it after their usage.\nDuring the &lt;a href=\"Oblivion%20Crisis\"&gt;Oblivion Crisis&lt;/a&gt;, the Underking's curse over Sancre Tor was also lifted by the &lt;a href=\"Hero%20of%20Kvatch\"&gt;Hero of Kvatch&lt;/a&gt;. The Hero slew the undead Blades, and the four Blades combined were able to lift the curse. With the curse gone, the Hero retrieved the &lt;a href=\"Armor%20of%20Tiber%20Septim\"&gt;Armor of Tiber Septim&lt;/a&gt; from Sancre Tor.\nYsmir Wulfharth.\nSecond Era.\nOther accounts attribute Ysmir Wulfharth as the Underking. During the Second Era, the Underking was called upon by &lt;a href=\"Almalexia\"&gt;Almalexia&lt;/a&gt; to fend off the &lt;a href=\"Akaviri%20Invasions\"&gt;Akaviri Invasions&lt;/a&gt; of the &lt;a href=\"Kamal\"&gt;Kamal&lt;/a&gt;, though other accounts attribute the &lt;a href=\"Greybeards\"&gt;Greybeards&lt;/a&gt; for having summoned him from Sovngarde. Following the invasion, he was said to have disappeared for some three hundred years, with some sources stating he returned to &lt;a href=\"Sovngarde\"&gt;Sovngarde&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe Underking would be awakened by the summoning of the Greybeards, who stated that someone would create a new Empire, defeating the elves to form a united Tamriel. Wulfharth believed he was the one, and so met with the Greybeards. Upon arrival, however, when the Greybeards spoke to Wulfharth, he was blasted to ash, proving that Wulfharth was not the one the prophecy foretold.\nWhen &lt;a href=\"Tiber%20Septim\"&gt;Tiber Septim&lt;/a&gt; was crowned the Emperor of Cyrodiil, Wulfharth was tasked with the Imperial expansion into &lt;a href=\"Skyrim\"&gt;Skyrim&lt;/a&gt;. He would later propose a full invasion of &lt;a href=\"Hammerfell\"&gt;Hammerfell&lt;/a&gt;, but is turned down by the Emperor personally, who instead chooses to intervene in a civil war in order to legitimize his claim to Hammerfell. At the same time, Wulfharth pressed on Tiber Septim the need to invade and conquer &lt;a href=\"Morrowind\"&gt;Morrowind&lt;/a&gt;, out of both a desire of vengeance and the prophecy of the Greybeards. Morrowind was invaded shortly after due to a need for ebony, but when the &lt;a href=\"Treaty%20of%20the%20Armistice\"&gt;Armistice&lt;/a&gt; was signed, Ysmir became furious and abandoned Tiber Septim.\nFollowing the research performed by Zurin Arctus on the Numidium, Tiber Septim contacted Wulfharth once more. The Emperor claimed that Wulfharth was right all along, and that the Tribunal should have been slain, and that he needs his help to create a plan to do so. Wulfharth accepts, but when he arrives he is ambushed by Imperial guards. In the chaos, Zurin Arctus is said to have used a soulgem on him. In his dying breath, Wulfharth's heart roared a hole through Arctus' chest, resulting in everyone present being killed and turned into ash, with Tiber Septim strolling in to take the soul gem, which would be known as the &lt;a href=\"Mantella\"&gt;Mantella&lt;/a&gt;. Fueled by the power of the Underking, Tiber Septim is able to use the Numidium to end the war.\nAfter Summerset Isle was conquered, the Underking appears, destroying the Numidium, and the Mantella falls into the sea. Even so, there remains uncertainty as to whether or not the Mantella was the heart of Tiber Septim or the heart of the battlemage."}

I call the group a guild for lack of a better term. They lived much like priests in a religious order, sharing everything and spending many hours of each day buried in books.\nBut to call them priests would seem to suggest that they were in some way reverent, which they were not. Late into most nights, we stayed awake drinking and telling bawdy tales\u2014even the oldest members of the order joined in.\nYet guild is not quite an accurate term, either. It suggests uniformity, and these men and women from across &lt;a href=\"Tamriel\"&gt;Tamriel&lt;/a&gt; were a motley bunch, a patchwork of young and old, educated and dullards. They argued constantly, in the most friendly fashion, calling each other names one moment and then laughing the next. They could not even agree on what the order was called. The older members insisted on the elaborate and archaic \"Esteemed Order of the Observers of the Celestial Motions and Portents,\" while younger members preferred the simple and evocative name \"&lt;a href=\"Star-Gazers\"&gt;Star-Gazers&lt;/a&gt;.\"\nA singular concern united the group. They shared a complete devotion to the study of the stars and the meaning of their motions, and that was the reason I had come among their number in that year of my apprenticeship. I, too, had a fascination with the heavens, and I hoped to benefit as much as I could from the breadth of their knowledge in order to further my own inquiries into the relationship of the stars to the properties of magic.\nHere, I must confess, that my time spent with the Star-Gazers did much to open my young eyes. After the first few months I sank into a deep depression, realizing that my interest in the relationship of the constellations to magic had already been thoroughly explored in a manner that seemed to be utterly complete. An apprentice such as myself could spend a lifetime reading what had already been written and in the end have not a single word of my own to contribute.\nHowever, as I spent more time in my study and among the Star-Gazers, I learned that there were many questions yet to be answered about the stars themselves. For all we understand about the workings of magic, we know very little about the workings of the heavens themselves. In fact, the more prosaic the question appears at first glance, the more likely it is that the answer yet eludes us.\nJust as I thought that all questions had been answered and there was no hope, I became energized once more by a flood of questions, each more startling than the last. Indeed, for all the knowledge that the great scholars had brought to their theories of magic, they could not answer how it is that the &lt;a href=\"Mundus%20Stones%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Mundus Stone&lt;/a&gt; came to be, or by what trickery &lt;a href=\"The%20Serpent%20%28Celestial%29\"&gt;the Serpent&lt;/a&gt; slips across the sky, knowing no season.\nIn fact, I soon realized that not one of the three great scholars of magic had ever set foot in Craglorn. How they could ignore the place where the &lt;a href=\"Nede%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Nedes&lt;/a&gt; once worshiped the stars and set the Mundus Stones in their foundations, I would never understand.\nIt was through this realization that Kardala was discovered. Energized by the thought of reaching new conclusions through first-hand observation, I entreated my very willing hosts to guide me into the desert. I hoped to study the Mundus Stones of the Lord, the Lady, and the Steed and find something new.\nSeveral books on the subject of Kardala have flattered me by embellishing history. They claim that by examining these Mundus Stones of the Warrior's charges, I surmised from their configuration that there must be another Mundus Stone connected to the Warrior within sight of the three stones.\nThis could not be further from the truth. While we were on our journey through the desert, I had consumed a great deal of water to fortify my health. As is known to happen, that water had to go somewhere. I excused myself, stepping just a little off the road, and let nature run its course. On my way back to my colleagues I became disoriented, and as I struggled to find the road a loose stone slipped beneath my foot. I fell back and avoided falling into the crack that broke open beneath me, revealing the entrance to Kardala.\nNaturally, my companions were excited beyond words. I credit them with some of the misinformation that has spread about Kardala's discovery. In fact, I never would have made the discovery without their willingness to guide me into the desert that day."}

The note will give instructions for the Agent to meet a mage in another town, whom hopes that the Agent will be willing to aide their \"Mages Guild compeers.\" The Agent can therefore head to the town listed in the letter, and speak with the mage.\nThe mage will reveal that they want the Agent to pick-up the notes from the sorcerer, whom has hidden themselves in a \"laboratory\" while researching the \"local tribe of vampires.\" The Agent is therefore dispatched to bring the \"precious notes\" back from the sorcerer, whom will be hiding in the same dungeon as identified by the bloodline contact. With that, the Agent must venture into the dungeon and find said sorcerer.\nThe sorcerer will attack the Agent on sight, although after being dealt a blow themselves they will respond:\n\"Wait a minute!

Undead creatures have slain or captured many within their expedition.\"\nWalkthrough.\n\"&lt;This man is wearing the uniform of a Mages Guild acolyte. His face is contorted in fear and pain. However he died, it was sudden and unpleasant.&gt;\"\nNear the &lt;a href=\"Ossuary%20of%20Telacar\"&gt;Ossuary of Telacar&lt;/a&gt;, you will find the body of a deceased mages guild acolyte. Upon examining said body, you will find a note indicating this mage was supposed to meet someone named &lt;a href=\"Andewen\"&gt;Andewen&lt;/a&gt; at their base camp. \nThe camp is in the east of the area. Head there and speak with Andewen, and she will tell you that this is thought to be the resting place of one of &lt;a href=\"Mannimarco%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Mannimarco&lt;/a&gt;'s most powerful underlings, a necromancer named &lt;a href=\"Telacar\"&gt;Telacar&lt;/a&gt;. She and her mages were investigating the site when the undead rose from their graves and attacked them. The Dominion soldiers here tried to get the mages to safety, but only Andewen made it back to camp. She suspects there are still other survivors, so she will send you to go look for them.\nYou can find &lt;a href=\"Eleril\"&gt;Eleril&lt;/a&gt; in the north of the ruins and &lt;a href=\"Yalorasse\"&gt;Yalorasse&lt;/a&gt; in the west, but beware of all the ghosts you will have to fight on the way. Once both are rescued, head to the south of the ruins and you will find one last acolyte, &lt;a href=\"Kelurmend\"&gt;Kelurmend&lt;/a&gt;. Eleril and Yalorasse can be rescued in any order, but Kelurmend has to be done last. He will ask you to follow him; speak to him a bit to the east and he will tell you that the Dominion soldiers were forcing the mages to work faster than what was safe. They found a bone scepter, and one of the soldiers grabbed it, which caused the undead to rise. \nHead back to the camp and look for this bone scepter. You can speak with Andewen, and she will tell you that the scepter is in her pack, just outside the tent. Take the scepter, then talk to Andewen again and she will tell you that this scepter is most likely some form of necromantic control rod. She thinks it might be used to control the ghost at the center of the ruins, the &lt;a href=\"Pale%20Sentinel\"&gt;Pale Sentinel&lt;/a&gt;. When you enter the ruins, the Pale Sentinel will appear and possess the body of a soldier; rough her up a bit, then use the scepter. The sentinel will head for the center of the ruins; follow her and speak with her there. \nThe Pale Sentinel will tell you that this is indeed the resting place of Telacar, and that the ghosts here are his spies. He is trying to get away from him before Telacar reawakes and she is bound to his will forever. You can agree to help keep Telacar asleep; if you do so, the Sentinel will open the entrance to the crypt here. Head in and talk to the Sentinel again, and he will explain what you need to do. Telacar's former partner &lt;a href=\"Vastarie\"&gt;Vastarie&lt;/a&gt; locked him in here with a magic door, but the magic is starting to fade. You will have to collect the materials needed to perform the ritual and refresh the lock. \nThe things you need can be found throughout the ruins. The Milky Rock can be found by smashing up some enemies and taking it from their bodies. \"&lt;a href=\"Vastarie%27s%20Journal\"&gt;Vastarie's Journal&lt;/a&gt;\" can be found in the western room, guarded by &lt;a href=\"The%20Boring%20Seneschal\"&gt;The Boring Seneschal&lt;/a&gt;. In the northern room, east of the entrance, you will find a Glowy Vial guarded by &lt;a href=\"The%20Creepy%20Alchemist\"&gt;The Creepy Alchemist&lt;/a&gt;. Finally, you will find the Old Skull in the eastern room, guarded by &lt;a href=\"The%20Spooky%20Bailiff\"&gt;The Spooky Bailiff&lt;/a&gt;. Once you have all of these things, head to the Constellation Room in the center of the ruins. In this room, you will see images of various constellations, with altars in front of them. Your task here is to place the Rock, the Vial and the Skull on the correct pedestals. Which item goes where can be learned from Vastarie's Journal; every paragraph bar the first contains the name of one of the constellations, as well as one of the items. The Old Skull goes to the Lord, the Vial goes to the Apprentice and the Milky Rock goes to the Atronach. \nUpon solving the puzzle, an apparition of Telacar will appear and imprison the Pale Sentinel. Talk to him and he will tell you that the wards here have not contained him in a long time, and that he has remained here by choice. He will say that he needs the Pale Sentinel for his work, and that he will resort to violence should you interfere. He will then take the Sentinel through the door ahead; follow them to the next room, and you will be confronted by &lt;a href=\"Calion%27s%20Husk\"&gt;Calion's Husk&lt;/a&gt;, the flesh atronach described in \"Vastarie's Journal\". Once you have defeated the remains of Telacar and Vastarie's son, head through the door ahead and speak with Telacar's projection there. \nTelacar will tell you what he has been trying to do; he has been trying to restore his son &lt;a href=\"Calion\"&gt;Calion&lt;/a&gt; to life. The Pale Sentinel is in fact a piece of Calion, and is needed to bring Calion back. At this point, you can choose who to side with. Telacar will claim that releasing Calion into the world in his spirit form will lead to him causing unintentional destruction. Meanwhile, Calion will tell you that he was in a lot of pain while his soul resided in the flesh atronach, and that he wants to be free. Make your choice by using the Bone Scepter on either Calion's Husk or on Telacar's body, which is in the back of the room. \nIf you use the scepter on the atronach, . If you use it on Telacar's body, he will be sucked back into it and the atronach will die. Speak with Calion after this to finish the quest. He will open a portal for you to get back to the base camp."}

Nearby, there should be a well with the &lt;a href=\"Child%27s%20Skeleton\"&gt;skeleton of a child&lt;/a&gt; at its base. Pick up Rin's Toy Sword, and a quest marker will then guide you back to the house. After entering the house, go back to the room where you found \"Rin's Journal\" and activate the toy sword onto the dresser near the bed. Immediately afterward, the ghosts of all three family members appear in the room behind you; speak to Rin to let them know they can rest. As a reward, they will give you the &lt;a href=\"Keys%20%28Skyrim%20Creation%20Club%29%23Key%20to%20Goldenhills%20Plantation\"&gt;Key to Goldenhills Plantation&lt;/a&gt;, completing the quest.

It's so easy to simply note its shape, its size, its color. Unassuming, discarded among the leaves and dirt. Any child could tell you those facts. And, admittedly, a child could also easily imagine what will become of the acorn, given simple knowledge. Of its possibility. Who among us does not know an acorn could one day become a tree?\nImagine, however, if one had never seen a tree before. Had never heard depictions or viewed drawings, and, without having been told of this tree, they are met with the simple acorn. Inconspicuous, small, inherently useless. Through all observations they could make, they are unable to connect the acorn presented to them with the image of a mighty oak.\nLike an acorn, the Clockwork City shows no signs of its grand potential to the unsynchronized mind. To &lt;a href=\"Nirn\"&gt;Nirn&lt;/a&gt; Above it appears to be but a world in miniature, buildings and roads simply shrunk and put in a contained space. The plaything of a god perhaps, to hold his most loyal followers and dangerous experiments. But those who hold this view are simply ignorant of the possibilities.\nClockwork City is the center of the wheel for Nirn-Ensuing, the Omni-Axle that shapes the world. Rich in beauty and alight with sublime terror, so the scripture tells us. Sympathetic perhaps to the reality of Nirn Extant, but its own reality altogether, apart from the imperfections born from &lt;a href=\"Lorkahn\"&gt;Lorkahn&lt;/a&gt;'s Great Lie.\nHere we work under the Divine Metronome, our hands covered in oil, our hearts devoted. We are the welders, the seekers of hidden knowledge. We walk the path of the divine piston, our souls clean and well-oiled. The truth of our Clockwork City is that of the wheels Eternal, where one can hear the tick and tock of &lt;a href=\"Tamriel\"&gt;Tamriel&lt;/a&gt; final.\nSee beyond the simple acorn. See the mighty oak that it shall become."}

We rarely admit it, but it's true. Each Prince, while horrifying, has a curious and often hilarious quirk. &lt;a href=\"Sheogorath\"&gt;Sheogorath&lt;/a&gt;'s peculiarities are well known, but when you really think about it, all the Princes are a bit silly. &lt;a href=\"Hircine\"&gt;Hircine&lt;/a&gt; has the clumsy head of an ungulate. &lt;a href=\"Sanguine\"&gt;Sanguine&lt;/a&gt; is an inveterate drunk. It's precisely these eccentricities that make the Princes a source of endless fascination for Daedrologists such as myself. Unlike the stuffy and aloof &lt;a href=\"Aedra\"&gt;Aedra&lt;/a&gt;, the Princes suffer from the same neuroses, flaws, and childish fixations that trouble &lt;a href=\"men\"&gt;men&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"mer\"&gt;mer&lt;/a&gt;. They are more like us than we care to admit. As for me? Of all the Daedric Princes, &lt;a href=\"Clavicus%20Vile\"&gt;Clavicus Vile&lt;/a&gt; is my favorite\u2014and it has everything to do with his loyal hound, &lt;a href=\"Barbas%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Barbas&lt;/a&gt;.\nI have come to believe that Clavicus Vile is unique in that he exists in two persons. This is, of course, the subject of vigorous debate in Daedrological circles. Many of my confederates would argue that Barbas is merely a greater Daedric servant\u2014no more linked to Vile than a horse is linked to its rider. But I urge you to consider the evidence. The first and most obvious proof of their consubstantiality is found in art. Crude, hand-carved idols dating back to the early &lt;a href=\"Merethic%20Era\"&gt;Merethic Era&lt;/a&gt; depict the masked figure of Clavicus Vile standing beside a large hound, as do ancient cave paintings. I have explored the width and breadth of &lt;a href=\"Tamriel\"&gt;Tamriel&lt;/a&gt; in search of Daedric oddities, and in all my travels I have never found any depiction of Vile that does not include Barbas at his side. I've also read hundreds of firsthand accounts detailing encounters with the Prince. Each of those accounts, without exception, features Barbas in some capacity.\nIf we accept the premise that Clavicus Vile and Barbas are (at least in some sense) the same person, the natural question is \"Why?\" Why would an entity possessing godlike power allow itself to be bifurcated? I have a number of hypotheses, but my best guess is simply this: companionship. The \"life\" of a Prince is one of near-total isolation. Some Princes, like &lt;a href=\"Hermaeus%20Mora\"&gt;Hermaeus Mora&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Nocturnal\"&gt;Nocturnal&lt;/a&gt;, appear to revel in this solitude. But everything we know of Clavicus Vile indicates that he is a profoundly social being. His love of bartering, his willingness to bestow wishes upon those that engage with him, his bewitching &lt;a href=\"Clavicus%20Vile%27s%20Masque\"&gt;mask&lt;/a&gt;\u2014each of these things point to a being that thrives on interaction, conversation, and play. A being so inclined would likely go mad without some companion to speak to, argue with, and complain about. One might even view it as a marriage of sorts, albeit an inverted one. Rather than two becoming one, as in the Pledge of Mara, one has become two\u2014a paradoxical reversal of the Aedric ritual.\n\"But why a dog?\" you ask? I've puzzled over this for years. Again, I can offer little more than supposition. My best guess is that it has to do with power roles. If Clavicus Vile sheared off a larger share of his animus to create an equal, the two would plot and scheme against each other constantly. In creating a canine counterpart, Vile ensures his position as master. Dogs are ancient symbols of loyalty and submission. They are servants and never masters. So it is with Barbas.\nOf course, Barbas is not always a dog. Like other Daedric Princes, Barbas can present himself in a number of different forms. He has appeared as both man and mer, as animals, lesser Daedra, even inanimate objects! This ability to bend his shape, but retain his fundamental animus is a power that no other Daedra on record has been able to replicate\u2014aside from Princes, that is. Coincidence? I think not.\nWe will likely never know Barbas's true nature with certainty, but the evidence points me to only one conclusion: Barbas and Clavicus Vile are one person in two forms. The master is also the servant. The handler is also the hound. It's a unique and fascinating paradox\u2014the sort of mystery that makes Daedrology worth studying!"}

Go back to sleep. The &lt;a href=\"Troll%20%28Online%29\"&gt;trolls&lt;/a&gt; can't get you here\u2014not so long as there is a &lt;a href=\"Viridian%20Sentinel\"&gt;Viridian Sentinel&lt;/a&gt;.\nWhat's that? You want to hear about the Viridian Sentinel again? Of course, my dear. Just lie back on your pillow and listen.\nEveryone in northern &lt;a href=\"Bangkorai\"&gt;Bangkorai&lt;/a&gt; knows about the Viridian Sentinel. The Sentinel is the guardian who makes all the wild things stay in the woods. The trolls, the &lt;a href=\"Bear%20%28Online%29\"&gt;bears&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"witch\"&gt;witch&lt;/a&gt;es and their &lt;a href=\"Wolf%20%28Online%29\"&gt;wolves&lt;/a&gt;\u2014none may come into the vanquished lands from the Wild so long as the Sentinel keeps watch. And the Sentinel will always keep watch.\nDid you know there was a time when there was no Viridian Sentinel? It was long, long ago in the before-times. We &lt;a href=\"Bretons%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Bretons&lt;/a&gt; had just won our freedom from the &lt;a href=\"Direnni%20Hegemony\"&gt;Direnni Elves&lt;/a&gt;, and the Elves were still spiteful about it. \"Go ahead, take these lands you call &lt;a href=\"High%20Rock%20%28Online%29\"&gt;High Rock&lt;/a&gt;,\" they said. \"You will not have them long. We will retreat to our &lt;a href=\"Isle%20of%20Balfiera%20%28Online%29\"&gt;towered island&lt;/a&gt;. We will renounce our covenant with the &lt;a href=\"Earth%20Bones\"&gt;Earth Bones&lt;/a&gt;. We will give these lands back to the Wild.\"\nAs is often the way when Elves speak, we did not understand what they meant, so we merely shrugged and set about the hard work of making the land our own. We plowed fields and sowed crops. We fenced meadows and made pastures for our livestock. We built roads and market towns so our people could sell each other their produce and wares. And all seemed well.\nBut then bad things began to happen on the farms nearest the woods. Witches lurked under the eaves, and Bretons who got too close to the forest began to disappear into its shadows, never to be seen again. Soon the farmers had to abandon the fields that were next to the woods.\nIt got worse. Things began to come out of the woods, fell creatures and beasts, mostly at night but sometimes even in the day. And they roamed across the farmlands, menacing the farm families and slaying them when they could. Many farmers said, \"We cannot stand before these creatures from the Wild. Come, we shall leave our farms and go to the towns.\"\nBut when they got to the towns they found there was no work for farmers\u2014and even worse there was little or nothing to eat, because the farmers were no longer sending food to the towns. The townspeople blamed the farmers for abandoning their farms, and the farmers blamed the townspeople for not sending their armed watch to guard them. No one could agree on what to do.\nOne of the farmboys, a lad named Greenward, was very worried. He went into the chapel and prayed earnestly to &lt;a href=\"Stendarr\"&gt;Stendarr&lt;/a&gt;, saying, \"O righteous lord of mercy and protection, we are in sore plight and in need of your aid. For the beasts of the Wild are no longer contained, and our lands are reverting to wilderness. Soon there will be no place for mortals who love order and harmony. I fear we will become beasts, forget our names, and turn our back on the Divines. Show us, O lord, how this may be prevented.\"\nThen a kingfisher flew into the chapel and landed on the altar before Greenward. It was a very large kingfisher, larger than any the lad had ever seen. It cocked its head, and then began to whistle and clack its beak. And Greenward seemed to hear speech among the whistles and clacks, words that said, \"The beasts come out of the Wild because they have forgotten your names, and believe you to be beasts like themselves, whom it is lawful to slay. Someone must go to the Wild and tell the beasts that he has a name, and the vanquished lands are forfeit to his claim.\" Then the kingfisher made a small mess, as birds will, and flew away.\nThe lad bowed and said, \"I shall do this for my family, and the other families of the vanquished lands.\" He hugged his father, he kissed his mother, and he left the town and went back to the edge of the Wild. There he met a savage tiger, who made as if to pounce upon him, but the lad said, \"It is not lawful to pounce upon me, for I have a name, and am no beast. My name is Greenward, and I claim this land as vanquished. Return to the Wild and come here no more.\"\nAnd do you know what? The savage tiger did exactly that. And so did the ravening wolves, and the shambling bears, and the fierce trolls, and the wicked &lt;a href=\"Spriggan%20%28Online%29\"&gt;spriggans&lt;/a&gt;: all returned to the Wild and came to the vanquished lands no more.\nWhen this was done the lad hoped his work was over and he could return to his family, but it was not so. For always new beasts came from the Wild who had to be taught the boundaries. So the lad lived thereafter under the eaves of the wood and walked the edge of the wild, telling the beasts his name and turning them back. And our people called him the Viridian Sentinel.\nEventually the Sentinel grew very old and felt that soon he might walk the borders no more. He began to worry. But a girl came to him and said she had been spoken to by a bird, and thereafter the two walked the border together. And when the Sentinel finally passed on and his name went with his soul to &lt;a href=\"Aetherius\"&gt;Aetherius&lt;/a&gt;, the girl became the new Viridian Sentinel, and the vanquished lands were still safe.\nSo it has been ever after. And so it will always be."}

We weren't wealthy by any means, so our family shrine was really no more than a small shelf. I remember that my mother would polish it every &lt;a href=\"Morndas\"&gt;Morndas&lt;/a&gt; eve, singing all the while. But despite all the songs and joyful communions, there was something about that space that set my skin to crawl\u2014like going into a dark basement by candlelight or waking suddenly from a bad dream.\nMy parents stored a great many relics on the threshold of our Waiting Door, but the one I remember best was a polished lure. My grandfather was a fisherman, you see. Not by trade, but by avocation. He would wake well before dawn and paddle out to the center of &lt;a href=\"Lake%20Hairan\"&gt;Lake Hairan&lt;/a&gt;, keen to hook a wrasse or two before beginning his daily labors.\nOne brisk morning in early &lt;a href=\"Frostfall\"&gt;Frostfall&lt;/a&gt;, I awoke from a dead sleep to the smell of pipe smoke. Afraid that my father had left his hookah smoldering, I crept out into the parlor to find the flame and smother it. To my great surprise his pipe rested on the end-table, cool as a river stone. Still, the scent persisted. I followed it around the corner and down the hall until, at length, I came to the Waiting Door. That same fear I always felt welled up in my throat. But then, seeing my grandfather's lure, I felt a profound sense of ease. I strained on my tip-toes to reach the shelf and took the lure in hand. This was, of course, thoroughly taboo, but in my child's heart I knew it was the right thing to do.\nWithout changing out of my night-clothes, I stole out the back door and jumped into my uncle's boat. I paddled out to my grandfather's favorite spot, affixed the lure to a line, and cast it out into the lake. I remember the water was like polished glass, and the moons' reflection glided across it so peacefully that even a single ripple felt like a blasphemy.\nAfter an hour of silence I got a bite\u2014a massive one. My lean arms strained against the fish for what felt like an eternity. Eventually, I landed it. It was a great fire-wrasse like my grandfather used to catch. My chest swelled with pride as I paddled home. By this point the sun had started to rise and the &lt;a href=\"bantam%20guar\"&gt;bantam guar&lt;/a&gt;s were stirring in their coops. I placed the fish on a flaying board and started toward my parents' room to tell them the tale. But at the last moment, I hesitated. I glanced over my shoulder to see the Waiting Door and the empty spot where my grandfather's lure was enshrined. I took the relic from my pocket, kissed it, and placed it back on the shelf.\nIn that moment I saw the face of my grandfather\u2014the face of my ancestors. And from that point onward, I was never afraid."}

He adds that it is best to split up, to cover more ground.\nFinding the Abandoned Cave, the Vestige will find the survivor going by the name of Meva Nelenim.

Prince Adrien was to be entombed here.\"\nWalkthrough.\nIn the &lt;a href=\"Pelin%20Graveyard\"&gt;Pelin Graveyard&lt;/a&gt;, you will run into a man named &lt;a href=\"Lort%20the%20Gravedigger\"&gt;Lort the Gravedigger&lt;/a&gt;. He will tell you that while he was preparing the burial of &lt;a href=\"Prince%20Adrien\"&gt;Prince Adrien&lt;/a&gt;, the dead came rising out of their graves. He just left the prince's corpse with &lt;a href=\"Dame%20Valyrie%20Spenard\"&gt;Dame Valyrie Spenard&lt;/a&gt; and fled, but he feels guilty, so he will ask you to head in and deal with the situation. \nHead to the center of the graveyard and you will find that the prince has risen. Speak with him; he will theorize that he is undead, though he does not understand why he is not a mindless killing machine like the other risen dead. He will ask you to head into the royal crypt to see whether any of his ancestors have also risen and can provide answers as to what is going on. Head into the crypt and search the coffins there. You will find that all the graves are empty; once you have searched all four of them, a mysterious voice will state just that. Examine the candle holder by the statue to speak with the mysterious voice; it will tell you that the dead here have risen to follow Prince Adrien into battle to avenge their enemies, and that this is &lt;a href=\"Arkay\"&gt;Arkay&lt;/a&gt;'s will. \nHead back outside and tell this to Prince Adrien. Once you have told him everything, he will tell you to bring this information to Dame Valyrie, who will be standing just to the west. Valyrie will wonder why, if the undead are Prince Adrien's army, they are hostile to everyone. She thinks that the dead must be pacified by pouring holy water on the blue flames seen throughout the graveyard, and will task you with doing so. Once you have extinguished four flames, meet Dame Valyrie at the south monument; she saw someone skulking around there. That person is &lt;a href=\"Father%20Quiston\"&gt;Father Quiston&lt;/a&gt;; Valyrie will tell you that he has been ignoring her, and will ask you to talk to him. \nFather Quiston will express his doubts at the idea that Arkay is responsible for raising the dead here; he will want to see the prince for himself, but in the meantime, he asks you to stop the evil spirits that are defiling the North and West Monuments. Both of these are to your north, with the west monument being just west of the north one. Once you have defeated the spirits defiling these monuments, head to the church to your southwest. There, you will find the prince and the priest confronting each other; speak with Dame Valyrie and she will explain what has happened. The dead did bow to prince Adrien, but Father Quiston thought this was a bad sign, and when they dripped holy water on the prince's hand, it burned. She will ask you to head into the mausoleums and use holy water to stop the corruption. \nIn the mausoleums, you will find the same blue flames that you quenched earlier. Speak with the flames and they will admit that the undead did not in fact rise because of Arkay. The flames will then disappear; pour holy water on the piles of bones gathered in each of the four mausoleums, then head back to Dame Valyrie. She will tell you that since you left, the prince had another argument with the priest and locked himself in the church. Speak with Father Quiston and he will tell you that there is a spare key buried by the big tree west of the church; retrieve it and head into the church. Inside, you will find the prince kneeling before a Daedra that is standing on the altar. Speak with him and the Daedra will speak through his mouth. It will challenge you to come see its power for yourself; head through the trap door behind the altar into the crypt. there, &lt;a href=\"Preinrha\"&gt;Preinrha&lt;/a&gt; will be waiting for you. Slay her, then head out of the crypt and speak with Prince Adrien.\nAdrien will tell you that the only way to truly slay this evil spirit is to kill him. The life force inside him is pure evil, so he must be put to rest. After this conversation, Father Quiston will perform the rites and the Prince will be laid to rest. Talk to Dame Valyrie to finish the quest."}

From there, down the cellar, hordes of foes, usually grouped in four, two being healers. After finding the Mysterious Tome, Hermaeus Mora appears and says that Graccus holds deep down the Manse the \"Oghma Infinium\", and even offers the magnificent book if the wizard is defeated.\nFinding a way beneath the cellar, there is a hole on the ground that goes pretty deep. Taking the drop, it ends in a large pool in an enormous cave. As Hermaeus Mora appears, he indicates down the path where Graccus and the Oghma Infinium are, where the ruins of the swallowed city remains.\nGoing through ways of solid ice and some &lt;a href=\"Frost%20Atronach%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Frost Atronachs&lt;/a&gt;, Graccus is located at the far end performing a ritual. After stopping and killing Graccus, reading the \"Oghma Infinium\" will grant a screaming action and the book to disappear. Hermeaus Mora projects himself atop of the altar table and is relieved that his artifact will be secure once again in &lt;a href=\"Apocrypha\"&gt;Apocrypha&lt;/a&gt;. If asked, admits that lied about giving the book for his own purposes. Anyway, impressed, he rewards the task with Discourse Amarantine and its hidden knowledge."}

In the earliest days, when &lt;a href=\"Ahnurr\"&gt;Ahnurr&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Fadomai\"&gt;Fadomai&lt;/a&gt; were still in love, he explored the heavens and his trails became the Many Paths. He was Ahnurr's Favored Son, and his father told him to find love like Ahnurr found with Fadomai. Akha mated with the Winged Serpent of the East, the Dune Queen of the West, and the Mother Mammoth of the North. He then went to the South and never returned. Instead, Alkosh appeared speaking warnings of the things Akha had made along the Many Paths.

In time, the children of Akha overthrew him and scattered his body on the West Wind. It is said that when &lt;a href=\"Khenarthi\"&gt;Khenarthi&lt;/a&gt; learned this, she flew across the Many Paths and put Alkosh back together. In doing so, she saw all the things Akha had wrought, including those that should not be. Now, Alkosh and Khenarthi safeguard the Many Paths from the wayward children of Akha. Pray to Alkosh not for his strength or his mighty roar, but for his sense of duty and purpose.\n&lt;a href=\"Alkhan\"&gt;Alkhan&lt;/a&gt;. The Scaled Prince. Firstborn of Akha, who bred with a demon of fire and shadow. He can devour the souls of those he kills to grow to an immense size. The songs tell us Alkhan was slain by &lt;a href=\"Lorkhaj\"&gt;Lorkhaj&lt;/a&gt; and his companions, but as an immortal Son of Akha he will return from the Many Paths in time. He is the enemy of Alkosh, Khenarthi, and Lorkhaj, and ever hungers for his crown.\n&lt;a href=\"Boethra\"&gt;Boethra&lt;/a&gt;. The Warrior of the East and West. She is the mate of &lt;a href=\"Mafala\"&gt;Mafala&lt;/a&gt;, who did not forget her love for Boethra after Ahnurr sent her into exile for her rebellious nature. Boethra walked the Many Paths in exile, and she returned. It was she who pried the eye from &lt;a href=\"Magrus\"&gt;Magrus&lt;/a&gt;, and this is why &lt;a href=\"Khajiit%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Khajiit&lt;/a&gt; value swords as well as claws. There is no need for a True Cat to pray to Boethra, as you honor this spirit merely by walking the Path, and only hiding in order to pounce. It is forbidden to say her name on nights of the &lt;a href=\"Ghost%20Moon\"&gt;Ghost Moon&lt;/a&gt;, as during these phases Boethra dons the death-shroud of Lorkhaj and wages war beyond the &lt;a href=\"Lunar%20Lattice\"&gt;Lattice&lt;/a&gt;.\n&lt;a href=\"Mafala\"&gt;Mafala&lt;/a&gt;.

She watches over Eight of the Many Paths, each of which a Khajiit must walk in time. Mafala aids the &lt;a href=\"Clan%20Mothers\"&gt;Clan Mothers&lt;/a&gt; in guiding the Khajiiti people along the Path and protecting our secrets from Others.
