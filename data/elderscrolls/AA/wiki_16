West of Belkarth is a large stretch of desert road that leads into &lt;a href=\"Bangkorai\"&gt;Bangkorai&lt;/a&gt;. Along this path are various bandits and dangerous creatures that should be avoided at all times. East of Belkarth is a crossroad connect &lt;a href=\"Upper%20Craglorn\"&gt;Upper Craglorn&lt;/a&gt; to the lower region and Elinhir. Continuing onward will take travelers to &lt;a href=\"Cyrodiil\"&gt;Cyrodiil&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Falkreath%20Hold\"&gt;Falkreath Hold&lt;/a&gt;. Belkarth itself is located at the lower end of the region. On the &lt;a href=\"Druadach%20Mountains\"&gt;Druadach Mountains&lt;/a&gt;, there is a river that flows all the way down to Belkarth, ending in a basin located south of the city. Down towards the lake are fields of fruit that Belkarth has heavily depended on. On the western hill lies the &lt;a href=\"Star-Gazers%27%20Observatory\"&gt;Star-Gazers' Observatory&lt;/a&gt;, which is a major landmark in the township. The center of Belkarth is the Bazaar and the famous &lt;a href=\"Crossroads%20Tavern\"&gt;Crossroads Tavern&lt;/a&gt;. On the northern end is the main road, as well as, several artisans and stables. Belkarth is located in what is considered &lt;a href=\"The%20Crowns\"&gt;Crown&lt;/a&gt; territory.\nHistory.\n&lt;a href=\"Second%20Era\"&gt;Second Era&lt;/a&gt;.\nDuring the &lt;a href=\"Interregnum\"&gt;Interregnum&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"2E%20582\"&gt;2E 582&lt;/a&gt;, Belkarth served as the most prominent settlement in the region of Craglorn. The city-state of &lt;a href=\"Elinhir\"&gt;Elinhir&lt;/a&gt; to the east was taken over by the &lt;a href=\"Blackcaster%20Mages%20Guild\"&gt;Blackcaster Mages Guild&lt;/a&gt; and the township of &lt;a href=\"Dragonstar\"&gt;Dragonstar&lt;/a&gt; was recently created as a mining outpost. Belkarth was the only substantial settlement in Craglorn. Unlike the rest of Hammerfell, the people of Belkarth were not involved with the &lt;a href=\"Daggerfall%20Covenant\"&gt;Daggerfall Covenant&lt;/a&gt;, since there was no centralized government in the region. It was at this time, the &lt;a href=\"Star-Gazers\"&gt;Star-Gazers&lt;/a&gt; had sought the help of &lt;a href=\"Vestige\"&gt;adventurers&lt;/a&gt; when they found that the stars in the sky had disappeared. &lt;a href=\"Hara\"&gt;Hara&lt;/a&gt;, leader of the Star-Gazers had sent adventurers to all corners of Craglorn, freeing the &lt;a href=\"Celestial\"&gt;Celestial&lt;/a&gt; beings, the &lt;a href=\"The%20Warrior%20%28Celestial%29\"&gt;Warrior&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"The%20Mage%20%28Celestial%29\"&gt;Mage&lt;/a&gt;. As they traveled Craglorn, they fought the forces of &lt;a href=\"The%20Serpent%20%28Celestial%29\"&gt;Malazar the Serpent&lt;/a&gt;. \nAfter journeying through Craglorn, the group of travelers had gathered other allies, while fending off Malazar's goons throughout Lower Craglorn. &lt;a href=\"Titus%20Valerius\"&gt;Titus Valerius&lt;/a&gt; was a &lt;a href=\"Nede\"&gt;Nede&lt;/a&gt; that lived during the time of &lt;a href=\"Tarish-Zi\"&gt;Tarish-Zi&lt;/a&gt;. Another ally was &lt;a href=\"Kelmen%20Locke\"&gt;Kelmen Locke&lt;/a&gt;, a former member of the &lt;a href=\"Mages%20Guild\"&gt;Mages Guild&lt;/a&gt;. Hara had revealed herself to be the &lt;a href=\"The%20Thief%20%28Celestial%29\"&gt;Thief&lt;/a&gt;, seeking a way to defeat Malazar. With this group of adventurers, Hara invaded &lt;a href=\"Reinhold%27s%20Retreat\"&gt;Reinhold's Retreat&lt;/a&gt; in the lower Belkarth Basin, where Malazar's forces were being held. In the end, Malazar was defeated, and Craglorn was saved, though another threat had appeared in Craglorn, this time through the &lt;a href=\"Scaled%20Court\"&gt;Scaled Court&lt;/a&gt;, worshippers of Malazar.\n&lt;a href=\"Third%20Era\"&gt;Third Era&lt;/a&gt;.\nDuring the &lt;a href=\"Imperial%20Simulacrum\"&gt;Imperial Simulacrum&lt;/a&gt; from &lt;a href=\"3E%20389\"&gt;3E 389&lt;/a&gt; to &lt;a href=\"3E%20399\"&gt;3E 399&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Emperor\"&gt;Emperor&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Uriel%20Septim%20VII\"&gt;Uriel Septim VII&lt;/a&gt; was imprisoned along with &lt;a href=\"Talin%20Warhaft\"&gt;Talin Warhaft&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;a href=\"Deadlands\"&gt;Deadlands&lt;/a&gt; by &lt;a href=\"Jagar%20Tharn\"&gt;Jagar Tharn&lt;/a&gt;. Tharn planned for months to capture the throne, and he was able to achieve so in the span of ten years. Tharn had a powerful weapon called the &lt;a href=\"Staff%20of%20Chaos\"&gt;Staff of Chaos&lt;/a&gt;, and he split it into nine pieces and scattered them across Tamriel, the staff was the only thing keeping Uriel Septim and Warhaft in &lt;a href=\"Oblivion%20%28Realm%29\"&gt;Oblivion&lt;/a&gt;. A warrior escaped his clutches and traveled all corners of Tamriel to retrieve the missing pieces. The hero was known as the &lt;a href=\"Eternal%20Champion\"&gt;Eternal Champion&lt;/a&gt;, and he assembled the staff and defeated Jagar Tharn at the &lt;a href=\"Imperial%20Palace\"&gt;Imperial Palace&lt;/a&gt;. The Eternal Champion had at one point visited the town of Belkarth Guard in their quest to recover the pieces."}

However, he also nervously states that he doesn't want to end up as a \"&lt;a href=\"Draugr%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;shambling corpse&lt;/a&gt;\" when he dies. He also has some knowledge of the &lt;a href=\"Dwemer\"&gt;Dwemer&lt;/a&gt;, though he considers the Nords more hardy, as they \"outlasted\" the Dwarves, despite their \"advanced\" culture. He also is nervous around Dwemer ruins, stating that they make him \"uneasy.\" He has a tendency to comment on most locations, mainly their architecture or significance.\nDescription.\nAfter hiring him for the standard 500\u00a0 fee, and if the &lt;a href=\"Last%20Dragonborn\"&gt;Dragonborn&lt;/a&gt; has the &lt;a href=\"Amulet%20of%20Mara%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Amulet of Mara&lt;/a&gt; on their person, Belrand becomes a &lt;a href=\"Marriage%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;marriage&lt;/a&gt; option. Belrand is also able to be recruited into the &lt;a href=\"Blades%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Blades&lt;/a&gt;.\nBelrand is a &lt;a href=\"Spellsword%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;spellsword&lt;/a&gt; that fights well with magic users and archers. He is well known for his stalwart resilience against death, for he has both healing spells and quick health regeneration. He cannot be killed by other creatures but can be killed by the player, albeit only when he is in the knocked out state.\nMarriage.\nBelrand can be married if the Dragonborn has the Amulet of Mara equipped and has him as a follower. If married, like all spouses, he opens a business that makes a daily profit of 100 . He will hold onto the gold as it increases until asked for it. He will buy or sell items, and, if asked, he will become a follower once more.\nCombat.\nAs a spellsword, Belrand has high skills in Destruction magic, one-handed weapons, and light armor, but can also use two-handed weapons and bows (albeit at lower effectiveness). At the initiation of combat (and despite having low Alteration and Conjuration skills), he often summons a &lt;a href=\"Conjure%20Familiar\"&gt;familiar&lt;/a&gt; and casts &lt;a href=\"Oakflesh\"&gt;Oakflesh&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"Stoneflesh\"&gt;Stoneflesh&lt;/a&gt; on himself. He is particularly useful when dual-wielding destruction staves, as he has a faster cast rate than any other non-mage follower."}

That is necromancy, it's true, but it represents only a fraction of what this &lt;a href=\"school%20of%20magic\"&gt;school of magic&lt;/a&gt; encompasses. The fact is that most of what you know about necromancy consists of untruths and superstition. Many of you reading this already dabble with necromancy every day. &lt;a href=\"Soul%20gem\"&gt;Soul gem&lt;/a&gt;s, part and parcel to the widely practiced art of &lt;a href=\"Enchanting%20%28Online%29\"&gt;enchanting&lt;/a&gt;, are created through necromancy. If you've ever been severely injured, or deathly ill, and had a healer bring you back from the brink of death, you've benefited from necromancy. It's no more good or evil than any &lt;a href=\"Destruction%20Staff%20%28Online%29\"&gt;destruction&lt;/a&gt; spell. It all comes down to how you use the magic.\nWhile a malicious &lt;a href=\"Necromancer%20%28Online%29\"&gt;necromancer&lt;/a&gt; might pull an unwilling spirit back to our world by force, I simply open a pathway and offer an invitation. I have done so quite often to briefly reunite loved ones, solve mysteries, and bring closure to restless spirits. Prayer and ceremony provide some comfort to the living and the dead, but necromancy serves to empower both, for good or ill. Rather than shunning this practice, the &lt;a href=\"Mages%20Guild%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Mages Guild&lt;/a&gt; should regulate it. Forcing necromancy into the shadows only serves to drive away benevolent practitioners and conceal those who study it with bad intentions.\nWith as much war and death as there is in this world, the knowledge to help those cling to life or be released from it has never been more needed."}

Something suspicious happens, and Beram and his crew are trapped in the dungeon with something quite nasty. Master &lt;a href=\"Aryon%20%28Morrowind%29\"&gt;Aryon&lt;/a&gt; was either oblivious or uninterested, I suppose.\nBeram Journal, Entry 1.\nToday we finally finished hewing out the two main jail rooms and all six cells, and almost as if in response to our celebration, several of those damned roots grew through the wall and took out two of our cells. I wonder constantly what those wizards could be up to up there in the tower, but I guess this is the nature of working for the &lt;a href=\"House%20Telvanni%20%28Morrowind%29\"&gt;Telvanni&lt;/a&gt;. I will inform them again of our construction plans (which THEY provided to us) and request that they refrain from such actions in the future. In the meantime, my men have begun setting up the necessary ramps and equipment to begin work on the next section of dungeon. Here's hoping it goes better than the first.\nBeramForeman\nBeram Journal, Entry 2.\nThe lower dungeon rooms have been proving much more difficult than we originally thought. We must be working near some lava flows, as the rock of the cave walls is exceptionally hard stuff. It's hard enough to see in here without all our proper lighting installed, I don't need this delay too. I have sent off for some new volcanic glass tools, and in the meantime, one of my men has found a section of cave softer than the rest, and we have continued our work there, bypassing this first room. A few men have expressed their concern over the light rumblings that we have been feeling lately, but I am convinced that it is just more of those Telvanni and their hocus-pocus mushroom magic. They assured us of this site's stability. The rats and bugs are annoying to us, but do not pose a threat. Hopefully we can find the source of this infestation soon and eliminate it. I don't have time for this.\nBeramForeman\nBeram Journal, Entry 3.\nThe worst has happened. This morning a boulder came loose from the ceiling and fell directly onto our major ramp, causing it to collapse and killing two of my men in the process. The remaining three of us are now stranded alone down here, with the cave walls being too sheer to climb, and the wizards obviously having more important things to deal with than a few errant laborers. With our water supplies diminishing rapidly, I sent &lt;a href=\"Norvus\"&gt;Norvus&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Gilam\"&gt;Gilam&lt;/a&gt; further down into the caves to look for any natural exits we might have missed when first surveying the site. Damn those wizards. They told us this site was safe. What could they be doing up there? Why are these bugs and rats getting more aggressive by the hour? And why is it getting so blasted hot?\nBeramForeman\nBeram Journal, Entry 4.\nI found Norvus's head and torso lying in this room, with a large part of the rest of him seemingly smeared along the walls. I screamed for full minutes when I found it, and now all I can do is sit and stare. My only solace is this paper. More roots keep penetrating the walls every minute, and the rocks and lights seem to be taking on lives of their own. Now I fear not only for my life, but for my sanity. Please someone come soon. The rumblings are getting faster and stronger, and I can't breathe this stifling air much longer. What in &lt;a href=\"Vivec\"&gt;Vivec&lt;/a&gt;'s name have these wizards done? The heat...\nBeram Journal, Entry 5.\nHE IS HERE!"}

Bergama is also the second largest settlement in the Alik'r, after the capital city of &lt;a href=\"Sentinel\"&gt;Sentinel&lt;/a&gt;. Bergama is a well-defended city as one side is nestled against sheer cliffs and high walls protect the others. Bergama has two entrances, which are located on its western and northern walls. The west gate leads into the &lt;a href=\"Myrkwasa\"&gt;Myrkwasa&lt;/a&gt; region as well as Sentinel, while the north gate leads into the rest of the Alik'r Desert and the &lt;a href=\"Hollow%20Wastes\"&gt;Hollow Wastes&lt;/a&gt;, an endless ocean of sand dunes that span for hundreds of miles.\nAt the western end of Bergama is the local bazaar, which spreads across the city's two-tiered terrain. Many trinkets and oddities come through Bergama and its market. The northern end of the city is the town square where local commerce occurs as well as the local inn. The southern end of the city has a beautiful park where colorful flowers bloom which is a rarity in the Alik'r.\nHistory.\n&lt;a href=\"First%20Era\"&gt;First Era&lt;/a&gt;.\n&lt;a href=\"Derik%20Hallin\"&gt;Derik Hallin&lt;/a&gt; and his army of &lt;a href=\"Redguard\"&gt;Redguard&lt;/a&gt; warriors fought the &lt;a href=\"Goblin\"&gt;Goblin&lt;/a&gt;s of Hammerfell in the first era. They had pushed the Tusked-Folk to the &lt;a href=\"Fallen%20Wastes\"&gt;Fallen Wastes&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"Bangkorai\"&gt;Bangkorai&lt;/a&gt; and need to keep watch of any Goblin insurgency coming onto Hallin and his army. &lt;a href=\"Abadaman%20of%20the%20Three%20Scars\"&gt;Abadaman of the Three Scars&lt;/a&gt; led a militia known as the &lt;a href=\"Bergama%20Gallants\"&gt;Bergama Gallants&lt;/a&gt; and commissioned the construction of a tower that watched over the Fallen Wastes and the Yokudan Wastes of &lt;a href=\"Craglorn\"&gt;Craglorn&lt;/a&gt;. The tower stood over the canyon and garnered the name the &lt;a href=\"Old%20Tower\"&gt;Old Tower&lt;/a&gt;. The Sentinel watches over Bangkorai for many years.\n&lt;a href=\"Second%20Era\"&gt;Second Era&lt;/a&gt;.\nDuring the &lt;a href=\"Interregnum\"&gt;Interregnum&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"2E%20582\"&gt;2E 582&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"Alik%27r%20Desert\"&gt;Alik'r Desert&lt;/a&gt; began to see a growing threat in the &lt;a href=\"Withered%20Hand\"&gt;Withered Hand&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Necromancy\"&gt;necromancer&lt;/a&gt; cult after they stole the &lt;a href=\"Ansei%20Ward\"&gt;Ansei Ward&lt;/a&gt;s from the &lt;a href=\"Impervious%20Vault\"&gt;Impervious Vault&lt;/a&gt; in Sentinel. The leaders of the Withered Hand scattered into the regions of the Alik'r Desert and had a presence in the Hollow Wastes. In Bergama, many citizens began to disappear, and the &lt;a href=\"Daggerfall%20Covenant\"&gt;Daggerfall Covenant&lt;/a&gt; eventually caught wind of this. A mysterious traveler that was known as the &lt;a href=\"Vestige\"&gt;Vestige&lt;/a&gt; investigated the situation and discovered a conspiracy between the Bergama government and the Withered Hand. &lt;a href=\"Magistrate%20Sulma\"&gt;Magistrate Sulma&lt;/a&gt; conspired with the Withered Hand to offer citizens in exchange for their lack of presence in Bergama. Sulma was arrested and put on trial in Sentinel.\nA momentous day had occurred in Bergama later in the same year. Young &lt;a href=\"Tiela%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Tiela&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"the%20Crowns\"&gt;the Crowns&lt;/a&gt; married young &lt;a href=\"Casnar%20at-Tarin\"&gt;Casnar at-Tarin&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"the%20Forebears\"&gt;the Forebears&lt;/a&gt; in Bergama square, and united the two rival groups in the Bergama Barony. Casnar sought out the perfect wedding gift for Tiela but was pushed back by the local brutes and was doubtful about the wedding. But luckily, the Vestige stepped in and settled the quarreling. The two Redguards married and ended the political boundaries set forth generations ago.\n&lt;a href=\"Third%20Era\"&gt;Third Era&lt;/a&gt;.\nDuring the &lt;a href=\"Warp%20in%20the%20West\"&gt;Warp in the West&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"3E%20405\"&gt;3E 405&lt;/a&gt;, Bergama was the capital of the Bergama Barony, and it was independent among the other 23 kingdoms of the &lt;a href=\"Iliac%20Bay\"&gt;Iliac Bay&lt;/a&gt;. At the time, Bergama was under the rule of an unknown baron and baroness that managed to keep the region afloat amidst the political conflict throughout the Iliac Bay, like with the &lt;a href=\"War%20of%20Betony\"&gt;War of Betony&lt;/a&gt;.\nIn the aftermath of the Warp in the West, the Kingdoms of &lt;a href=\"Daggerfall\"&gt;Daggerfall&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Wayrest\"&gt;Wayrest&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Sentinel\"&gt;Sentinel&lt;/a&gt; began to control adjacent political regions into their domain to create a unified Kingdom. On the 9th of &lt;a href=\"Frostfall\"&gt;Frostfall&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Queen%20Akorithi\"&gt;Queen Akorithi&lt;/a&gt; of Sentinel sent her soldiers to the city of Bergama to take control of the Barony of Bergama. A massive sandstorm had dazed the region and left Bergama defenseless to an incoming invasion from Sentinel. The city of Bergama was attacked during the night and fell to Sentinel. In a matter of two days, the other Hammerfell kingdoms in the &lt;a href=\"Iliac%20Bay\"&gt;Iliac Bay&lt;/a&gt; were under a single banner, the banner of Sentinel. This was likely caused from the Warp itself.\nAkorithi of Sentinel eventually passed away leaving &lt;a href=\"Lhotun\"&gt;Lhotun&lt;/a&gt;, her eldest son to become the new ruler of Sentinel and the surrounding Kingdoms such as Bergama. Lhotun prepared for this moment and managed to create a third political party against the Forebears and the Crowns known as the Lhotunic. &lt;a href=\"Queen%20Clavilla\"&gt;Queen Clavilla&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"Taneth\"&gt;Taneth&lt;/a&gt; went against King Lhotun by speaking out against his practices. This inspired the High Prophet of &lt;a href=\"Elinhir\"&gt;Elinhir&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Ayaan-si\"&gt;Ayaan-si&lt;/a&gt; to revolt against Lhotun by assembling the Crown-affiliated kingdoms to attack Lhotun's Sentinel. She had forays in places such as Bergama and the &lt;a href=\"Dak%27fron%20Desert\"&gt;Dak'fron Desert&lt;/a&gt; as well as &lt;a href=\"Totambu%20%28City%29\"&gt;Totambu City&lt;/a&gt;. It is unknown how long the rebellion has managed."}

Indeed, they are mentioned in &lt;a href=\"Khosey\"&gt;Khosey&lt;/a&gt;'s venerable \"&lt;a href=\"Tamrilean%20Tractates\"&gt;Tamrilean Tractates&lt;/a&gt;,\" which speak of \"ye Trohl of Rapace, thrice-orbed Enormity [that] Eateth ye Fleshe of [both] Commons and Kyngs.\"\nAfter our long history on Tamriel with them, we &lt;a href=\"men\"&gt;men&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"mer\"&gt;mer&lt;/a&gt; should really know quite a bit about trolls, should we not? Perhaps so\u2014but we don't. The few facts at our disposal are as follows:\n- Trolls are fierce and formidable carnivores, devouring anything they can catch down to fingernails and marrow.\n- A troll injured by any means but fire heals with preternatural speed, a regeneration almost certainly magical in nature.\n- Troll fat is a reagent prized by alchemists, though its virtues seem to vary depending on different recipes and rendering techniques.\n- Despite their physical prowess, trolls are reclusive creatures, and their lairs are usually found well off the beaten track.\nWe can say little else with certainty, save that trolls live in a range of habitats and seem to exist in variations appropriate to their environment of origin. The most common, and therefore best-known types of trolls, include the Forest Trolls of central Tamriel, and the Frost Trolls of the far north.\nBut history and legend tell us of other types of trolls, more obscure perhaps, but no less fascinating. Some, like the Lava Trolls of &lt;a href=\"Vvardenfell%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Vvardenfell&lt;/a&gt;, are almost certainly extinct (if, indeed, they ever existed outside the fevered imaginations of &lt;a href=\"Dunmer%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Dark Elf&lt;/a&gt; corner club raconteurs). But today we shall speak of a rare breed of \"Trohl of Rapace\" that you can definitely still encounter\u2014and not in far-off regions like &lt;a href=\"Argonia\"&gt;Middle Argonia&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"Topal%20Bay\"&gt;Topal Island&lt;/a&gt;. They live in &lt;a href=\"Cyrodiil%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Cyrodiil&lt;/a&gt; itself \u2026 if one knows where to look for them.\nI'm speaking of the elusive &lt;a href=\"River%20Troll\"&gt;River Troll&lt;/a&gt;. You won't find it listed on the Imperial Register of Beasts and Lower Beings, but it's real nonetheless, as I can readily attest. I myself have personally seen, in the marketplace of &lt;a href=\"Sutch\"&gt;Sutch&lt;/a&gt;, the carcass of a River Troll that was brought in by an intrepid hunter who traps the tributaries of the &lt;a href=\"Brena%20River\"&gt;Brena&lt;/a&gt;. She told me they lair out of sight in riverside caves or burrows, subsisting on &lt;a href=\"Mudcrab%20%28Online%29\"&gt;mudcrabs&lt;/a&gt;, large fish, and &lt;a href=\"crocodile\"&gt;crocodile&lt;/a&gt;s\u2014as well as upon unwary people, when they can get them. This might be why they're so rarely reported, as few survive such an encounter.\nThe appearance of the corpse, fire-scarred though it was, bore out the brave hunter's account. Unlike the familiar forest variety, this River Troll's hide was clad in shiny water-shedding scales, silver-blue in color and as durable as they were flexible. The long scaly hands had webbing between the clawed fingers, and the fangs were the sharp, spiky teeth of fish-eaters. The hunter said they can hold their breath for long periods, lurking unseen in the shallows until they erupt from ambush to overwhelm their prey.\nSince that encounter I've questioned others who range the wild places of Cyrodiil and learned that the experience of the hunter of Sutch was not unique. River Trolls, though rarely seen, can be found lurking in the watersheds of the Brena, &lt;a href=\"Strid%20River\"&gt;Strid&lt;/a&gt;, and central &lt;a href=\"Niben%20river\"&gt;Niben river&lt;/a&gt; systems, and doubtless account for a fair percentage of the livestock\u2014and people\u2014who go missing in these regions. Knowing what I do now has certainly persuaded me to confine my nature walks to paths on the drier uplands, lest I end my scholarly career as fodder for trollkins in some muddy riverside burrow!"}

Of course, we all know the name from the taunting children's joke that goes:\n\"Guess what?\"\n\"What?\"\n\"Spriggan butt!\"\n\u2026But beyond this juvenile jest, what can scholarship tell us about these half-flora/half-fauna creatures? Unfortunately, though I have consulted all the standard sources, the academics of &lt;a href=\"Tamriel\"&gt;Tamriel&lt;/a&gt; have little to say about the spriggans' whys and wherefores.\nFrom both legend and from authenticated stories of personal encounters, we know that spriggans are somehow mystically tied to certain copses or thickets, verdant groves which they fiercely defend against trespassers. &lt;a href=\"Spriggan%20Sap\"&gt;Spriggan sap&lt;/a&gt; is said to be venomous, and they are known to be able to magically heal themselves when wounded, making them dangerous opponents.\nIn addition, spriggans have some sort innate connection to the animals and plants that inhabit their sacred groves, and there are many verified accounts of animals fighting at their sides against intruders. These allies include not just animals that are naturally aggressive, such as &lt;a href=\"Bear%20%28Online%29\"&gt;bears&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"Giant%20Wasp\"&gt;swarms of hornets&lt;/a&gt;, but even usually timid creatures like &lt;a href=\"Deer%20%28Online%29\"&gt;deer&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Elk%20%28Online%29\"&gt;elk&lt;/a&gt;.\nWhether these animal allies defend spriggans out of love or friendship, or whether they are magically summoned by an innate spell ability on the part of the spriggan, is an open question, and a matter of some debate among those who study mystizoology. There is no doubt, however, that spriggans are creatures of a magical nature, as is clearly evidenced by the powerful qualities of the so-called \"&lt;a href=\"taproot\"&gt;taproot&lt;/a&gt;s\" that are harvested from their bodies when slain. These taproots are prized by &lt;a href=\"Alchemists%20%28Online%29\"&gt;alchemists&lt;/a&gt; for their undeniable arcane properties, which enable the concoction of complex potions from powerful &lt;a href=\"reagents\"&gt;reagents&lt;/a&gt; that are otherwise immiscible.\nAs to their origins, that is a mystery that so far none have solved. We find accounts of \"Spryggain Groaves\" dating all the way back to the beginning of the &lt;a href=\"First%20Era\"&gt;First Era&lt;/a&gt;, as well as mention of \"tree-daughters\" in the ancient myths of &lt;a href=\"Y%27ffre\"&gt;Y'ffre&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Earth%20Bones\"&gt;Earth Bones&lt;/a&gt;. Their common name seems to derive from \"sprig,\" the &lt;a href=\"Nede%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Nedic&lt;/a&gt; term for a fresh green twig or offshoot, but beyond that everything about their origins is obscure.\nFrom a purely physical standpoint spriggans certainly come in several forms, with reports of a variety of barks and foliage. This may represent different strains or sub-species, or it may simply be a reflection of the spriggan's mystical connection with its local flora. Spriggans seem to resemble the plants of the groves wherein they live, even reflecting the seasonal nature of those who reside in the deciduous forests of northern Tamriel. In the opinion of this scholar, the so-called spring, summer, autumn, and winter spriggans are all the same creatures merely undergoing seasonal metamorphosis.\nSome have gone so far as to assert that spriggans have a hierarchy, with lesser members of the species owing allegiance to the greater, who are sometimes termed \"&lt;a href=\"Spriggan%20Matron%20%28Online%29\"&gt;spriggan matron&lt;/a&gt;\" or even \"&lt;a href=\"spriggan%20earth%20mother\"&gt;spriggan earth mother&lt;/a&gt;.\" Here is where we must draw the line between scholarship and storytelling: though a spriggan's form outwardly resembles that of a human female, there is no evidence whatsoever that they can engage in intelligent behavior, or that they can organize into hierarchical groups. The creatures of the natural world, even those that are quasi-magical, behave entirely according to instinct, and to endow them with human emotion or thought is mere sentimentalism. If you're partial to that sort of fanciful twaddle, I refer you to the works of &lt;a href=\"Lady%20Cinnabar\"&gt;Lady Cinnabar&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"Taneth\"&gt;Taneth&lt;/a&gt;, who produces it in great reams."}

When spoken to, she says that a \"terrifying beast\" named\u00a0&lt;a href=\"Lockjaw\"&gt;Lockjaw&lt;/a&gt;\u00a0is nearby and requests that the Vestige kills it. Before you head off, make sure to pick up the copy of &lt;a href=\"The%20Red%20Book%20of%20Riddles\"&gt;The Red Book of Riddles&lt;/a&gt; by Nilwen's cabin. Go to the location she specified and kill Lockjaw, then return to Nilwen.

Once there, a bird, who is in fact Greatclaw, may be found next to a dead body, but will fly away when approached. Then return to Nilwen, who will commend the Vestige's actions and give them a third task.\nYour final objective is to eliminate a\u00a0&lt;a href=\"Goblin%20%28Online%29\"&gt;goblin&lt;/a&gt;\u00a0named\u00a0&lt;a href=\"Cracktooth\"&gt;Cracktooth&lt;/a&gt;, near &lt;a href=\"Ragged%20Hills%20Dolmen\"&gt;Ragged Hills Dolmen&lt;/a&gt;.

Kill the giant and return to Nilwen, who will reward you for completing the quest.\nAlternatively, after killing Lockjaw, you may choose not to go after the other \"beasts\" and instead report her to &lt;a href=\"Constable%20Gerrunn\"&gt;Constable Gerrunn&lt;/a&gt; for squatting. He will tell you that she is in fact no helpless maiden and that she makes a living by getting adventurers to attack giants and then looting their bodies once the giants kill them. Gerrunn will then tell you that there is no point in pursuing as she will be long gone by now, and then give you your reward."}

I resort to such measures out of desperation. I pen this while Battlehorn Castle lies besieged by a band of ruthless marauders, with little hope that any of us will survive. \"Besieged\" I say, although this petty battle would not have even rated a footnote in the great days of the Knights of the True Horn. We have fallen on hard times, indeed.\"\n\"I will entrust this document to my last faithful retainers, with instructions to destroy it in the last extremity, although I accept that I may have provided the means for my murderers to legally take the lordship of Battlehorn Castle. So be it.\"\n\"To the new lord of Battlehorn Castle, whoever you are, know that you inherit a stronghold with a proud tradition. Battlehorn Castle was built by a remnant of the Knights of the True Horn who were exiled from our homeland of &lt;a href=\"Lainlyn\"&gt;Lainlyn&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Hammerfell\"&gt;Hammerfell&lt;/a&gt;. After a failed battle to dethrone Baron Shrike of Lainlyn, our leader, Lord Kain, ordered us to split up into as many small groups as possible until the time should come that he would recall us. My father was part of a group that settled here in Cyrodiil and built Battlehorn Castle as a refuge while they waited for Lord Kain's message... a message that never arrived.\"\n\"Over the years, all the Knights of our little band either gave up or passed on, all but one: my father Jaren. Since his untimely death, I have continued to hold Battlehorn Castle in the hope that someday we will hear from Lord Kain and our great exile will be at an end.\"\n\"I am afraid that the fortunes of Battlehorn Castle have fallen on hard times. What resources I had available I devoted to maintaining the castle itself\u2014its walls still stand strong and its hearths still provide warmth. Sadly, this came at great cost, and many of the items within its walls had to be sold in order to meet the enormous payments such maintenance begets. If you find yourself with the means to restore Battlehorn Castle to its former glory, a friend of my father's named Nilphas Omellian still holds many of the castle accoutrements in storage and on account. All that is required is to repay the Castle's debts to Nilphas, and I'm certain he'll happily return the items.\"\n\"My final request for the new lord of Battlehorn Castle is to continue to uphold the proud traditions of the Knights of the True Horn, and to honor the memory of our brave service.\"\nQuests.\n&lt;a href=\"Battlehorn%20Castle%20%28Quest%29\"&gt;Battlehorn Castle&lt;/a&gt;.\nI've heard a rumor that the defenders of Battlehorn Castle are besieged by marauders and are appealing for aid. Apparently their commander has been killed, and they're offering the castle itself to anyone who will help lift the siege."}

The guild was founded in the year &lt;a href=\"2E%20320\"&gt;2E 320&lt;/a&gt; by &lt;a href=\"Dinieras-Ves\"&gt;Dinieras-Ves&lt;/a&gt; under the supervision of the &lt;a href=\"Akaviri%20Potentate\"&gt;Akaviri Potentate&lt;/a&gt; of the &lt;a href=\"Reman%20Empire\"&gt;Reman Empire&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Versidue-Shaie\"&gt;Versidue-Shaie&lt;/a&gt;. Shortly after its establishment, it became the official mercenaries guild that citizens from all walks of life in Tamriel depended on for protection and combat assistance. The Fighters Guild will accept almost any contract. Contracts pertaining to the killing of infestations of &lt;a href=\"rat\"&gt;rat&lt;/a&gt;s, eliminating troublesome &lt;a href=\"bandits\"&gt;bandits&lt;/a&gt;, delivering packages, and escorting high-ranking nobles are all suitable jobs for a member of the Fighters Guild.\nBy game.\n\"For more specific information, please refer to one of the following:\"\nHistory.\nSecond Era.\nFoundation.\nAfter the &lt;a href=\"Potentate%20Versidue-Shaie\"&gt;Potentate Versidue-Shaie&lt;/a&gt; conquered the rebelling princes, he was left with a chaotic land. He had spent the last of his armies and gold fighting the princes, and with no standing army left to guard the towns and villages, crime everywhere had skyrocketed. A solution was created when &lt;a href=\"Dinieras-Ves\"&gt;Dinieras-Ves&lt;/a&gt; \"The Iron\" suggested the creation of an order of mercantile warriors-for-hire. Originally called The Syffim, after the &lt;a href=\"Tsaesci\"&gt;Tsaesci&lt;/a&gt; word for 'soldiers,' it was eventually changed to Fighters Guild. It was to be comprised of only &lt;a href=\"Akaviri\"&gt;Akaviri&lt;/a&gt; soldiers, but many men were needed, and the Tsaesci didn't understand the local geography and politics of where they were assigned, so natives were often recruited.\nPlanemeld.\nSometime prior to &lt;a href=\"2E%20582\"&gt;2E 582&lt;/a&gt;, then guildmaster &lt;a href=\"Jofnir%20Iceblade\"&gt;Jofnir Iceblade&lt;/a&gt; was killed under mysterious circumstances. During the &lt;a href=\"Planemeld\"&gt;Planemeld&lt;/a&gt;, under his successor Guildmaster &lt;a href=\"Sees-All-Colors\"&gt;Sees-All-Colors&lt;/a&gt;, the Guild worked actively to assist in thwarting &lt;a href=\"Molag%20Bal\"&gt;Molag Bal&lt;/a&gt;'s invasion of Nirn. Originally investigating &lt;a href=\"Dark%20Anchors\"&gt;Dark Anchors&lt;/a&gt;, the guild recovered an &lt;a href=\"Ayleid\"&gt;Ayleid&lt;/a&gt; artifact known as the &lt;a href=\"Prismatic%20Crystal\"&gt;Prismatic Crystal&lt;/a&gt; from &lt;a href=\"Mzeneldt\"&gt;Mzeneldt&lt;/a&gt;, which was initially hidden as it provided the source of power for the &lt;a href=\"Mortuum%20Vivicus\"&gt;Mortuum Vivicus&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href=\"Aelif\"&gt;Aelif&lt;/a&gt;, a traitor of the guild working under Bal, attempted to manipulate the &lt;a href=\"Vestige\"&gt;Vestige&lt;/a&gt; into killing Colors after framing her for Iceblade's murder. The Vestige later decided to believe Colors, causing Aelif to reveal her true intentions and used the Vivicus in order to transform herself as a &lt;a href=\"Daedric%20Titan\"&gt;Daedric Titan&lt;/a&gt;. The Guild defeated Aelif, with Jofnir's spirit giving the Vestige the Prismatic Weapon and going to &lt;a href=\"Sovngarde%20%28Location%29\"&gt;Sovngarde&lt;/a&gt;.\nDuring the allied invasion of &lt;a href=\"Coldharbour\"&gt;Coldharbour&lt;/a&gt;, the Fighters Guild, along with the &lt;a href=\"Mages%20Guild\"&gt;Mages Guild&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"First%20Aldmeri%20Dominion\"&gt;First Aldmeri Dominion&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Daggerfall%20Covenant\"&gt;Daggerfall Covenant&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Ebonheart%20Pact\"&gt;Ebonheart Pact&lt;/a&gt;, entered the realm from &lt;a href=\"Stirk\"&gt;Stirk&lt;/a&gt;. With no global leader, the long-imprisoned Ayleid king, &lt;a href=\"Laloriaran%20Dynar\"&gt;Laloriaran Dynar&lt;/a&gt;, took up the title of leader. A master tactician and strategist, Dynar led the assault all the way towards &lt;a href=\"Heart%27s%20Grief\"&gt;Heart's Grief&lt;/a&gt;, and used knowledge of a captured guildhall in &lt;a href=\"the%20Reaver%20Citadel\"&gt;the Reaver Citadel&lt;/a&gt; to maneuver the armies through the &lt;a href=\"Fist%20of%20Stone\"&gt;Fist of Stone&lt;/a&gt;. Dynar was mortally wounded defending the army from a Daedric attack, and entrusted the Vestige with a gift in his dying moments.\nThird Era.\nThe Fighters Guild gained greater prominence during the early &lt;a href=\"Third%20Era\"&gt;Third Era&lt;/a&gt; under Emperor &lt;a href=\"Uriel%20I\"&gt;Uriel I&lt;/a&gt;. In &lt;a href=\"3E%20397\"&gt;3E 397&lt;/a&gt;, the guild maintained a hall in Skyrim-occupied &lt;a href=\"Dragonstar\"&gt;Western Dragonstar&lt;/a&gt;, led by &lt;a href=\"Dominus\"&gt;Dominus&lt;/a&gt;. In &lt;a href=\"3E%20405\"&gt;3E 405&lt;/a&gt;, the guild also operated in many locations around &lt;a href=\"Iliac%20Bay\"&gt;Iliac Bay&lt;/a&gt;. Many of their missions involved defeating harmful creatures, though their most important one involved saving spy Lord &lt;a href=\"K%27avar\"&gt;K'avar&lt;/a&gt;.\nIn &lt;a href=\"3E%20427\"&gt;3E 427&lt;/a&gt;, the Fighters Guild in &lt;a href=\"Morrowind\"&gt;Morrowind&lt;/a&gt; was suffering from corruption in &lt;a href=\"Vivec%20City\"&gt;Vivec City&lt;/a&gt;, causing many to worry about the direction the guild was taking. As a result, the corrupt leader &lt;a href=\"Sjoring%20Hard-Heart\"&gt;Sjoring Hard-Heart&lt;/a&gt;, who was in league with the &lt;a href=\"Camonna%20Tong\"&gt;Camonna Tong&lt;/a&gt;, was executed by the &lt;a href=\"Nerevarine\"&gt;Nerevarine&lt;/a&gt;. They also sought out the deaths of high-ranking members of the &lt;a href=\"Thieves%20Guild\"&gt;Thieves Guild&lt;/a&gt;, including their guildmaster &lt;a href=\"Gentleman%20Jim%20Stacey\"&gt;Gentleman Jim Stacey&lt;/a&gt;.\nIn &lt;a href=\"3E%20433\"&gt;3E 433&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"Cyrodiil\"&gt;Cyrodiil&lt;/a&gt; fighters guild mainly operated in &lt;a href=\"Anvil\"&gt;Anvil&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Cheydinhal\"&gt;Cheydinhal&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Chorrol\"&gt;Chorrol&lt;/a&gt;. They looked into the dealings of the rival &lt;a href=\"Blackwood%20Company\"&gt;Blackwood Company&lt;/a&gt;, another mercenary guild situated in &lt;a href=\"Leyawiin\"&gt;Leyawiin&lt;/a&gt; that would take jobs the Fighters Guild would not. With the help of their recruit, the &lt;a href=\"Hero%20of%20Kvatch\"&gt;Hero of Kvatch&lt;/a&gt;, the guild infiltrated the Blackwood Company and discovered they were harvesting &lt;a href=\"Hist%20Sap\"&gt;Hist Sap&lt;/a&gt; from the &lt;a href=\"Hist\"&gt;Hist&lt;/a&gt; trees. &lt;a href=\"Modryn%20Oreyn\"&gt;Modryn Oreyn&lt;/a&gt; ordered the execution of all members of the company and had the Hero destroyed the pumps of the hist tree, effectively eliminating their rivals in the province.\nFourth Era.\nDespite having operating guildhalls in &lt;a href=\"Shor%27s%20Stone\"&gt;Shor's Stone&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Riften\"&gt;Riften&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Windhelm\"&gt;Windhelm&lt;/a&gt; during the &lt;a href=\"Second%20Era\"&gt;Second Era&lt;/a&gt;, the Fighters Guild's presence was no longer in &lt;a href=\"Skyrim\"&gt;Skyrim&lt;/a&gt; by the &lt;a href=\"Fourth%20Era\"&gt;Fourth Era&lt;/a&gt;, with &lt;a href=\"The%20Companions\"&gt;The Companions&lt;/a&gt; becoming the primary mercenary guild in the province."}

The order was initially called \"The Syffim,\" after the Tsaesci word for \"soldiers,\" but the name was changed by the Potentate to the more common name known by the people: the Fighters' Guild.\nThe Fighters Guild was formed sometime after the Potentate conquered &lt;a href=\"Tamriel\"&gt;Tamriel&lt;/a&gt; in one of the bloodiest conflicts in history. The only army left standing was that of the Potentate, but the economy was also knocked off its feet. Local cities had no militia or force to protect them, especially outside of &lt;a href=\"Cyrodiil\"&gt;Cyrodiil&lt;/a&gt; where the Potentate's forces were concentrated. The Fighters' Guild was formed to combat rising crime rates across the lands. It was originally intended to be a guild for &lt;a href=\"Akaviri\"&gt;Akaviri&lt;/a&gt; races only, but since there were not enough of them to keep order, it was opened to non-Akaviri members as well.\nAnyone interested in &lt;a href=\"Combat%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;combat&lt;/a&gt; that is focused on an honest living can join the Guild. Unfortunately, the guild has recently started having trouble with a new group of mercenaries known as the &lt;a href=\"Blackwood%20Company\"&gt;Blackwood Company&lt;/a&gt; who have been stealing contracts and fighters from them. This is outlined in the &lt;a href=\"Black%20Horse%20Courier\"&gt;Black Horse Courier&lt;/a&gt; newsletter &lt;a href=\"A%20New%20Guild%20for%20Fighters%3F\"&gt;A New Guild for Fighters?&lt;/a&gt;\nGuild locations.\nAll of the cities except for the &lt;a href=\"Imperial%20City\"&gt;Imperial City&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Kvatch%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;Kvatch&lt;/a&gt; have a guildhall of the Fighters Guild inside its walls. The most important guildhalls are located in &lt;a href=\"Anvil%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;Anvil&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Chorrol%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;Chorrol&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Cheydinhal%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;Cheydinhal&lt;/a&gt;, as this is where Fighters Guild quests are obtained, but each guild has members who offer various services, including &lt;a href=\"Skills%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;skill&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Trainers%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;training&lt;/a&gt;.\nRanks and guild perks.\nAt \"Master\" rank, access to the Guildmaster's Chest in &lt;a href=\"Chorrol%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;Chorrol&lt;/a&gt; is received, which offers a monthly revenue and items from the Fighters Guild. Orders can be given to &lt;a href=\"Modryn%20Oreyn%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;Modryn Oreyn&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Chorrol%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;Chorrol&lt;/a&gt; to focus on either recruitment of new members, completion of contracts, or both equally. Focusing on recruitment reins in more items in the chest, while doing contracts brings in more gold.\nEach rank is earned after completion of one, or multiple, quests:\nQuests.\nThe Fighters Guild quests do not follow a linear order. For example, after completing \"&lt;a href=\"Trolls%20of%20Forsaken%20Mine\"&gt;Trolls of Forsaken Mine&lt;/a&gt;\" from &lt;a href=\"Modryn%20Oreyn%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;Oreyn&lt;/a&gt;, \"&lt;a href=\"The%20Noble%27s%20Daughter\"&gt;The Noble's Daughter&lt;/a&gt;\" and \"&lt;a href=\"The%20Stone%20of%20St.%20Alessia\"&gt;The Stone of St. Alessia&lt;/a&gt;\" can be completed in any order, with subsequent quests (\"&lt;a href=\"Mystery%20at%20Harlun%27s%20Watch\"&gt;Mystery at Harlun's Watch&lt;/a&gt;\" after \"&lt;a href=\"The%20Noble%27s%20Daughter\"&gt;The Noble's Daughter&lt;/a&gt;\") afterward.

The first offense involves retrieving 20 &lt;a href=\"Bear%20Pelt%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;Bear Pelts&lt;/a&gt; for &lt;a href=\"Vilena%20Donton\"&gt;Vilena Donton&lt;/a&gt; in Chorrol. The second requires 20 &lt;a href=\"Minotaur%20Horn\"&gt;Minotaur Horn&lt;/a&gt;s be obtained. If the rank of &lt;a href=\"Arena%20%28Faction%29%23Ranks\"&gt;Grand Champion&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;a href=\"Arena%20District%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;Arena&lt;/a&gt; has been obtained, then &lt;a href=\"Bear%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;bears&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"Minotaur%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;minotaurs&lt;/a&gt; can easily be fought, as opposed to searching Cyrodiil for them. Bear Pelts can be purchased from most &lt;a href=\"General%20Goods%20Merchants%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;General item traders&lt;/a&gt;.\nAfter three offenses, the member is forever expelled, with no chance of reprieve.\nDemotion.\nAfter completion of \"&lt;a href=\"Trolls%20of%20Forsaken%20Mine\"&gt;Trolls of Forsaken Mine&lt;/a&gt;\", the Hero is demoted one rank. Upon completion of \"&lt;a href=\"The%20Stone%20of%20St.%20Alessia\"&gt;The Stone of St. Alessia&lt;/a&gt;\" and \"&lt;a href=\"The%20Noble%27s%20Daughter\"&gt;The Noble's Daughter&lt;/a&gt;\", the rank of Guardian is restored.\nFighters Guild members by city.\nThere are a number of members of the Fighters Guild at each guildhall, as well as some members outside of the guildhalls who play a part in contracts. Also in every guildhall there is a &lt;a href=\"Fighters%20Guild%20Porter\"&gt;Porter&lt;/a&gt; who repairs weapons and armor for a price."}

They will also offer rewards such as a set of achievements, special cosmetic gear, and more for destroying Dark Anchors. Killing Daedra or Undead also increases Fighters Guild ranks. Abilities in the Fighters Guild skill line are effective against Daedra and the undead, as well as players that have become &lt;a href=\"Vampire%20%28Online%29\"&gt;vampires&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"Werewolf%20%28Online%29\"&gt;werewolves&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe Fighters Guild has headquarters in the city of &lt;a href=\"Wayrest%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Wayrest&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"High%20Rock%20%28Online%29\"&gt;High Rock&lt;/a&gt;, the city of &lt;a href=\"Elden%20Root%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Elden Root&lt;/a&gt; in\u00a0&lt;a href=\"Valenwood%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Valenwood&lt;/a&gt; and the city of &lt;a href=\"Mournhold%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Mournhold&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Morrowind%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Morrowind&lt;/a&gt;.\nLeadership.\nDuring the events of The Elder Scrolls Online, the Fighters Guild was lead by &lt;a href=\"Jofnir%20Iceblade\"&gt;Jofnir Iceblade&lt;/a&gt;. After his death, the leadership falls to an\u00a0&lt;a href=\"Argonians%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Argonian&lt;/a&gt;\u00a0named\u00a0&lt;a href=\"Sees-All-Colors\"&gt;Sees-All-Colors&lt;/a&gt;. Under the new leadership, the Guild has been contracted by an influential patron to focus its forces entirely against the forces of &lt;a href=\"Molag%20Bal%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Molag Bal&lt;/a&gt; and the destruction of the Dark Anchors, arousing much controversy among the members.\nGenerally, the Guildmaster leads the entire Fighters Guild. Each province in &lt;a href=\"Tamriel\"&gt;Tamriel&lt;/a&gt; where the guild makes its presence meanwhile is headed by a Province General who handles business in the province in the Guildmaster's stead. The Province Generals all hold council as to how the guild should be run at a provincial level. Under the Province Generals, Provosts lead each guild hall located in the towns and cities the guild operates in, while Hall Stewards of each Guild Hall make sure each hall and its members are looked after.\nQuests.\nTo begin quests for the Fighters Guild, the &lt;a href=\"Vestige\"&gt;Vestige&lt;/a&gt; must complete one of the three invitation quests offered in the first non-tutorial zone of each alliance. Upon joining, there are two types of Fighters Guild quests: the main questline and &lt;a href=\"repeatable%20quests\"&gt;repeatable quests&lt;/a&gt;. The main Fighters Guild questline is a series of quests related to the guild's ongoing contract to hunt Daedra since the &lt;a href=\"Planemeld\"&gt;Planemeld&lt;/a&gt;. Each main quest occurs sequentially in one of each alliance's zones, its equivalent zones in the other alliances having the same quest available. For example, the first quest, \"&lt;a href=\"Anchors%20from%20the%20Harbor\"&gt;Anchors from the Harbor&lt;/a&gt;,\" is available in &lt;a href=\"Auridon\"&gt;Auridon&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Glenumbra%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Glenumbra&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Stonefalls%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Stonefalls&lt;/a&gt;. Prior to the &lt;a href=\"One%20Tamriel\"&gt;One Tamriel&lt;/a&gt; update, each quest was only available in zones belonging to the player's alliance. There are two types of repeatable Fighters Guild quests: Dark Anchors and bounties. Dark Anchor quests are completed by destroying three Dark Anchors in a specified alliance zone and bounties are completed by eliminating a specific type of target in Cyrodiil.\n&lt;onlyinclude&gt;\n &lt;a href=\"Aicessar%27s%20Invitation\"&gt;Aicessar's Invitation&lt;/a&gt;\n &lt;a href=\"Basile%27s%20Invitation\"&gt;Basile's Invitation&lt;/a&gt;\n &lt;a href=\"Hilan%27s%20Invitation\"&gt;Hilan's Invitation&lt;/a&gt;\n &lt;a href=\"Anchors%20from%20the%20Harbor\"&gt;Anchors from the Harbor&lt;/a&gt;\n &lt;a href=\"The%20Dangerous%20Past\"&gt;The Dangerous Past&lt;/a&gt;\n &lt;a href=\"The%20Prismatic%20Core\"&gt;The Prismatic Core&lt;/a&gt;\n &lt;a href=\"Proving%20the%20Deed\"&gt;Proving the Deed&lt;/a&gt;\n &lt;a href=\"Will%20of%20the%20Council\"&gt;Will of the Council&lt;/a&gt;\n \n \n &lt;a href=\"Dark%20Anchors%20in%20Alik%27r%20Desert\"&gt;Dark Anchors in Alik'r Desert&lt;/a&gt;\n &lt;a href=\"Dark%20Anchors%20in%20Auridon\"&gt;Dark Anchors in Auridon&lt;/a&gt;\n &lt;a href=\"Dark%20Anchors%20in%20Bangkorai\"&gt;Dark Anchors in Bangkorai&lt;/a&gt;\n &lt;a href=\"Dark%20Anchors%20in%20Deshaan\"&gt;Dark Anchors in Deshaan&lt;/a&gt;\n &lt;a href=\"Dark%20Anchors%20in%20Eastmarch\"&gt;Dark Anchors in Eastmarch&lt;/a&gt;\n &lt;a href=\"Dark%20Anchors%20in%20Glenumbra\"&gt;Dark Anchors in Glenumbra&lt;/a&gt;\n &lt;a href=\"Dark%20Anchors%20in%20Grahtwood\"&gt;Dark Anchors in Grahtwood&lt;/a&gt;\n &lt;a href=\"Dark%20Anchors%20in%20Greenshade\"&gt;Dark Anchors in Greenshade&lt;/a&gt;\n &lt;a href=\"Dark%20Anchors%20in%20Malabal%20Tor\"&gt;Dark Anchors in Malabal Tor&lt;/a&gt;\n &lt;a href=\"Dark%20Anchors%20in%20Reaper%27s%20March\"&gt;Dark Anchors in Reaper's March&lt;/a&gt;\n &lt;a href=\"Dark%20Anchors%20in%20Rivenspire\"&gt;Dark Anchors in Rivenspire&lt;/a&gt;\n &lt;a href=\"Dark%20Anchors%20in%20Shadowfen\"&gt;Dark Anchors in Shadowfen&lt;/a&gt;\n &lt;a href=\"Dark%20Anchors%20in%20Stonefalls\"&gt;Dark Anchors in Stonefalls&lt;/a&gt;\n &lt;a href=\"Dark%20Anchors%20in%20Stormhaven\"&gt;Dark Anchors in Stormhaven&lt;/a&gt;\n &lt;a href=\"Dark%20Anchors%20in%20the%20Rift\"&gt;Dark Anchors in the Rift&lt;/a&gt;\n&lt;/onlyinclude&gt;"}

At the destruction of his fortress in &lt;a href=\"Dawnstar\"&gt;Dawnstar&lt;/a&gt;, he gathered the &lt;a href=\"Imperial%20Council\"&gt;Imperial Council&lt;/a&gt; in what would be called the &lt;a href=\"Council%20of%20Bardmont\"&gt;Council of Bardmont&lt;/a&gt;, after the town south of Dawnstar where they met. There the Potentate declared catholic and universal martial law. The princes of Tamriel would dissolve their armies or face his wrath.\nThe next thirty-seven years were perhaps the bloodiest in the violent history of Tamriel.\nIn order to crush the last of the royal armies, Versidae-Shaie had to sacrifice many of his best legions, as well as spend nearly every last piece of gold in the Imperial treasury. But he accomplished the unthinkable. For the first time in history, there was but one army in the land, and it was his own.\nThe problems that immediately surfaced were almost as staggering as the triumph itself. The Potentate had impoverished the land by his war, for the vanquished kingdoms had also spent the last of their gold in defense. Farmers and merchants alike had their livelihood ruined. Before the princes of Tamriel would not pay his taxes - now, they could not.\nThe only persons who benefited from the war were criminals, who preyed upon the ruins of the lawless land, without fear of arrest now that all the local guards and militia were gone. It was a crisis the Akavir had seen coming long before he destroyed the last of his subjects' armies, but for which he had no solution. He could not allow his vassals their own armies again, but the land was deeper into the stew of anarchy that it had ever been before. His army sought to fight the rise of crime, but a central authority was no threat against the local underworld.\nIn the dawn of the year &lt;a href=\"2E%20320\"&gt;320&lt;/a&gt;, a kinsman of Versidae-Shaie, &lt;a href=\"Dinieras-Ves\"&gt;Dinieras-Ves&lt;/a&gt; \"the Iron,\" presented himself with a host of companions before the Potentate. It was he who suggested an order of mercantile warriors-for-hire, who could be hired by nobility in lieu of a standing army. The employment would be temporary, and a percentage of the fee would go to the Potentate's government, thus putting salve on two of Versidae-Shaie's greatest pains.\nThough it was then called The Syffim, after the &lt;a href=\"Tsaesci\"&gt;Tsaesci&lt;/a&gt; word for 'soldiers,' the organization that was to be known as the &lt;a href=\"Fighters%20Guild\"&gt;Fighters Guild&lt;/a&gt; had been born.\nDinieras-Ves \"the Iron\" initially believed that the entirety of the order should be composed of Akaviri. This belief of his is not disputed by any historian, though his motivation is often debated. The traditional, simple explanation is that he knew his countrymen well, trusted them, and felt that their tradition of fighting for profit would be of use. Others believe, with reason, that he and the Potentate sought to use the order to effectively complete the conquest of Tamriel begun over five hundred years earlier. When Akavir attacked Tamriel in the &lt;a href=\"1E%202703\"&gt;2703rd&lt;/a&gt; year of the &lt;a href=\"First%20Era\"&gt;1st era&lt;/a&gt;, they had been beaten back by the &lt;a href=\"Reman%20Dynasty\"&gt;Reman Dynasty&lt;/a&gt;. Now they had a Potentate on the throne, and with Dinieras-Ves's machinations, the local armies would also be &lt;a href=\"Akaviri\"&gt;Akaviri&lt;/a&gt;. What they had failed to do by combat, they would have successfully accomplished by patience. A traditional strategem, many scholars suggest, of the immortal snake men, the Tsaesci of Akavir, who always had time on their side.\nThe point, however, is largely academic. Though the Syffim did establish themselves in some kingdoms neighboring &lt;a href=\"Cyrodiil\"&gt;Cyrodiil&lt;/a&gt;, it became quickly apparent that local warriors were needed. Part of the problem was simply that there were not enough Akaviri for the work that needed to be done. Another part was that the snake men did not understand the geography and politics of the regions they were assigned.\nIt was evident that some non-Akaviri were needed in the Syffim, and by the midpoint of the year, three &lt;a href=\"Nords\"&gt;Nords&lt;/a&gt;, a &lt;a href=\"Battlemage\"&gt;warrior-sorceress&lt;/a&gt;, a &lt;a href=\"rogue\"&gt;rogue&lt;/a&gt;, and a &lt;a href=\"Knight\"&gt;Knight&lt;/a&gt; were admitted into the order.\nThe knight, whose name has been lost in the sands of time, was also a great &lt;a href=\"Armorer%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;armorer&lt;/a&gt;, and probably did more to strengthen the organization than anyone but Dinieras-Ves himself. As has often been stated, the Akaviri, particularly the Tsaesci, understood weaponry better than armor. Even if they could not wear it themselves, the knight was able to explain to the other Syffim what the weaknesses were in their opponent's armor, explaining to them how many joints there were in a &lt;a href=\"Armor%20%28Morrowind%29%23Pauldrons\"&gt;pauldon&lt;/a&gt; and a &lt;a href=\"Armor%20%28Morrowind%29\"&gt;grieve&lt;/a&gt;, and the differences between Aketons and Armkachens, Gorgets and Gliedshrims, Palettes and Pasguards, Tabards and Tassettes.\nWith this knowledge, they made long strides in defeating the brigands, doing far better than their meager numbers would suggest. It is a joke among historians that if Akavir had a Nord armorer in their employ in the first era, they would have won the invasion.\nThe success of these first three outsiders to the Syffim opened the door for more local members. Before the year was through, Dinieras-Ves had spread his business throughout the Empire. Young men and women, for a variety of reasons - because of desperate poverty, for love of action and adventure, in order to aid their crime-stricken neighbors - joined his new order en masse. They received training, and were immediately put to work helping the aristocracy's problems, assuming the roles of guards and soldiers within their locality.\nThe early success of the Syffim in combating crime and defeating local monsters so inspired Potentate Versidae-Shaie that he entertained representatives from other organizations interested in Imperial sanction. Though formed much earlier, the Mages Guild had always been viewed with suspicion by the government. In the &lt;a href=\"2E%20321\"&gt;321st year&lt;/a&gt; of the &lt;a href=\"Second%20Era\"&gt;2nd Era&lt;/a&gt;, the Potentate gave his approval to the &lt;a href=\"Guilds%20Act\"&gt;Guilds Act&lt;/a&gt;, officially sanctioning the &lt;a href=\"Mages%20Guild\"&gt;Mages&lt;/a&gt;, together with the Guilds of Tinkers, Cobblers, Prostitutes, Scribes, Architects, Brewers, Vintners, Weavers, Ratcatchers, Furriers, Cooks, Astrologers, &lt;a href=\"Council%20of%20Healers\"&gt;Healers&lt;/a&gt;, Tailors, &lt;a href=\"Bards%20College%20%28Faction%29\"&gt;Minstrals&lt;/a&gt;, Barristers, and the Syffim. In the charter, they were no longer called the Syffim, however: bowing to the name it had become known as by the people, they were to be called the Fighters Guild. All the Guilds, and those that followed by later sanctions throughout the &lt;a href=\"Second%20Era\"&gt;second&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Third%20Era\"&gt;third eras&lt;/a&gt;, would be protected and encouraged by the Empire of &lt;a href=\"Cyrodiil\"&gt;Cyrodiil&lt;/a&gt;, recognizing their value to the people of Tamriel. All would be required to pay to expand their influence throughout the land. The Empire was strengthened by their presence, and the Imperial coffers were filled once again.\nShortly after Versidae-Shaie's death, only three years after the Guild Act, his heir &lt;a href=\"Savirien%20Chorak\"&gt;Savirien-Chorak&lt;/a&gt;, allowed the reforming of local armies. The Fighters Guild was no longer the principal arm of the local aristocracy, but their worth had already been established. Though there were certainly strong individuals who sought their own fortunes in the past, many historians have suggested that Dinieras-Ves was the ancestor in spirit of the modern phenomenon of the Adventurer, those men and women who dedicate their lives to questing for fame and fortune.\nThus, all owe a debt of gratitude to the Fighters Guild -- not only its members, and the people who have been helped by its neutral policy of offering strong arms for a fee within the boundaries of the law. Without them, there would be no guilds of any kind, and it may be argued, no model for even the independent Adventurer."}

He is &lt;a href=\"Jorunn%20the%20Skald-King\"&gt;Jorunn the Skald-King&lt;/a&gt;'s exiled brother and leader of the famed &lt;a href=\"Stormfist%20Brigade\"&gt;Stormfist Brigade&lt;/a&gt; of western &lt;a href=\"Skyrim\"&gt;Skyrim&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Vestige\"&gt;Vestige&lt;/a&gt; encounters Fildgor with his Stormfist and &lt;a href=\"Orsimer%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Orsimer&lt;/a&gt; allies throughout &lt;a href=\"Eastmarch%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Eastmarch&lt;/a&gt; as they try to usurp the throne from the current &lt;a href=\"High%20King\"&gt;High King&lt;/a&gt;. He takes on the name Fildgor Orcthane and tries to disrupt the festivities of the Konunleikar in &lt;a href=\"Windhelm%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Windhelm&lt;/a&gt;, and is considered the region's primary antagonist.\nBackground.\nFildgor was the second son of Queen Mabjaarn, twins with Jorunn and younger brother of then &lt;a href=\"Nurnhilde\"&gt;Nurnhilde&lt;/a&gt;. While his brother studied the art of the skald at a young age, Fildgor who favored martial prowess explored the western lands of Skyrim to see its people where he met and befriended the Stormfist Clan. Although not of their own clan, eventually he became its leader and formed the Stormfist Brigade, where he and the Stormfists grew in reputation as brave adventurers.\nIt was during &lt;a href=\"Dir-Kamal\"&gt;Dir-Kamal&lt;/a&gt;'s invasion of Skyrim that the Stormfist Brigade was put to the test. Fildgor and the Stormfists took back the beleaguered city from the &lt;a href=\"Akaviri\"&gt;Akaviri&lt;/a&gt; invaders, but not before the Queen and his older sister was killed. With the throne left vacant, Fildgor claimed the throne of Skyrim, only to be challenged by Jorunn who believed Fildgor's warlike intentions would bring ruin to Skyrim. To prevent a civil war, Jorunn challenged his brother to single combat, defeating Fildgor and exiling his brother from his lands. Since then, he has taken on the name Fildgor Orcthane, gathering the strength of his Stormfist allies and befriending &lt;a href=\"Daggerfall%20Covenant\"&gt;Covenant&lt;/a&gt; and Orcish forces, waiting for a perfect time to strike against his brother.\nInteractions.\nFildgor first makes his presence to the Vestige and his brother Jorunn during the &lt;a href=\"Konunleikar\"&gt;Konunleikar&lt;/a&gt; celebrations in Windhelm. Sending a champion to represent the Stormfist Clan in the celebrations, the Stormfist Clan struck during the final contest at the &lt;a href=\"Hall%20of%20Trials\"&gt;Hall of Trials&lt;/a&gt; and charged at King Jorunn and his retinue.\nFildgor then sent his troops to capture &lt;a href=\"Fort%20Morvunskar\"&gt;Fort Morvunskar&lt;/a&gt;. The Vestige arrives with reinforcements from Windhelm, only to find out that Fildgor was only after the remains of Nurnhilde. Fildgor is seen for the first time by the Vestige as he flees the fort, leaving behind his lieutenant &lt;a href=\"Shukul%20gro-Agluk\"&gt;Shukul gro-Agluk&lt;/a&gt; to deal with the Vestige.\nAt &lt;a href=\"Fort%20Amol%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Fort Amol&lt;/a&gt;, Fildgor sent his newly recruited &lt;a href=\"Bretons%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Breton&lt;/a&gt; assassin and alchemist &lt;a href=\"Dhalen\"&gt;Dhalen&lt;/a&gt; to disrupt the King's council with the rest of the &lt;a href=\"Ebonheart%20Pact\"&gt;Pact&lt;/a&gt; members. Dhalen and his &lt;a href=\"Daggerfall%20Covenant\"&gt;Covenant&lt;/a&gt; assassins assumed the faces of the royal guards through the use of an &lt;a href=\"Argonians%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Argonian&lt;/a&gt; substance and infiltrated &lt;a href=\"Jarl%20Ivannar\"&gt;Jarl Ivannar&lt;/a&gt;'s manor. Planning to take on Jorunn's appearance, Dhalen was stopped by the Vestige and the &lt;a href=\"Dunmer%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Dunmer&lt;/a&gt; assassin &lt;a href=\"Naryu%20Virian%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Naryu Virian&lt;/a&gt;, but not before poisoning the king with &lt;a href=\"Daedra%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Daedric&lt;/a&gt; poison.\nJorunn manages to live with the help of the &lt;a href=\"Dreamwalker\"&gt;Dreamwalker&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Ternion%20Monks\"&gt;Ternion Monks&lt;/a&gt;, while Fildgor retreats to &lt;a href=\"Skuldafn%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Skuldafn&lt;/a&gt;. He plans to merge with Nurnhilde's spirit in &lt;a href=\"Sovngarde%20%28Location%29\"&gt;Sovngarde&lt;/a&gt;, forcing the &lt;a href=\"Crown%20of%20Freydis\"&gt;Crown of Freydis&lt;/a&gt; to recognize him. This would allow him to usurp Jorunn and become High King. However, Fildgor is stopped by the Vestige. Depending on the Vestige's choice, he can either be killed by the Vestige, killed by Jorunn, or spared and sent to prison."}

Wulf believes he may have become a werebear, and warned me to keep an eye out for him.\"\nWalkthrough.\nAfter releasing the &lt;a href=\"Skaal\"&gt;Skaal&lt;/a&gt; from &lt;a href=\"Miraak\"&gt;Miraak&lt;/a&gt;'s influence, Wulf Wild-Blood will ask the &lt;a href=\"Last%20Dragonborn\"&gt;Dragonborn&lt;/a&gt; to find his brother Torkild. While he is not sure he has become a &lt;a href=\"Werebear%20%28Dragonborn%29\"&gt;werebear&lt;/a&gt;, he remembers seeing a fire in his eyes not common to the Skaal:\nHow long have you been First Hunter? \"In days past, my brother Torkild and I would share the hunt, but that was... long ago.\"\nThis quest may be hard to finish, as Torkild will only appear in a &lt;a href=\"Random%20Encounters%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;random encounter&lt;/a&gt;. Torkild may also be found dead before being spoken to, but this should not interfere with the quest and the response by Wulf will still be the same.\nThere are a few locations where random encounters occur and he may be found:\nThe easiest way to find him is to save the game before talking to Wulf. After the quest officially begins, fast travel to any of the locations above and look for him. If he is not there, reload the save file and try again. He will appear eventually.\nAfter finding Torkild the Dragonborn may talk to him:\n\"Who... thirst for sky... All-Maker craves the night of sun.\"\nTorkild? Your brother is looking for you. \"He hears the underslake of blood dust!\"\nAre you alright? \"They can't talk to wave signs!\"\nAfter dialogue ends, Torkild will transform into a werebear and attack. Searching his body yields\u00a0&lt;a href=\"Torkild%27s%20Letter%20to%20Wulf\"&gt;a note&lt;/a&gt; to his brother Wulf. The Dragonborn can also kill Torkild without talking to him and take the letter. When given the letter, Wulf will express his sadness at his brother's death, but also relief that he is at rest:\nI have this letter from your brother. \"It looks like I was right. He was taken in by that... where did you find this?\"\nIt is possible to &lt;a href=\"pickpocket\"&gt;pickpocket&lt;/a&gt; Torkild's letter\u00a0from Wulf Wild-Blood after the quest has been completed. Wulf rewards the Dragonborn with a skill increase to &lt;a href=\"Archery%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Archery&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Block%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Block&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"One-Handed%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;One-Handed&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Heavy%20Armor%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Heavy Armor&lt;/a&gt;."}

He wants the death to happen quickly, before the Order of the Hour attacks the Sanctuary.\"\nWalkthrough.\nAfter completing \"&lt;a href=\"The%20Wrath%20of%20Sithis\"&gt;The Wrath of Sithis&lt;/a&gt;,\" speak with Speaker Terenus. He will tell you it is time to move against Primate Artorius, and that you will be the one who gets to kill him. All of your brothers and sisters will be aiding you in this endeavor; Tanek is currently in Kvatch surveying the Cathedral's defenses. \nHead to Kvatch and speak with Tanek. He will be in the cathedral's graveyard, by the entrance to the catacombs. He has been clearing away some rubble that collapsed here when they expanded the mausoleum, but now there should be enough room for you to use the catacombs to enter the cathedral unnoticed. Head through; about halfway through the catacombs, you and &lt;a href=\"Kor\"&gt;Kor&lt;/a&gt; will face off against a Wamasu Matriarch. Kill the thing, and Kor and &lt;a href=\"Hildegard\"&gt;Hildegard&lt;/a&gt; will head off again. Further on, &lt;a href=\"Elam%20Drals\"&gt;Elam Drals&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Astara%20Caerellius\"&gt;Astara Caerellius&lt;/a&gt; will be unable to make their way past a locked gate, so you will have to take the long route through the room to the west. In said room, you will have to help &lt;a href=\"Grazda\"&gt;Grazda&lt;/a&gt; face off against some &lt;a href=\"Order%20of%20the%20Hour%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Order of the Hour&lt;/a&gt; enemies, culminating in a fight with &lt;a href=\"Captain%20Furia\"&gt;Captain Furia&lt;/a&gt;. Once they are dead, Elam Drals will come in and tell you that the entrance to the cathedral is just ahead. \nProceed onward into the cathedral. You will find the primate there; all your brothers and sisters will aid you in the fight as Artorius calls in the last of his goons. Artorius will be invulnerable much of the time, but occasionally he will freeze everyone but you and him in place. This is when you can deal damage to the man. Once his health has been brought to zero, you will be able to assassinate him by impaling him with his own staff. \nOnce Artorius is dead, head back to the sanctuary and speak with Speaker Terenus to finish both the quest and the questline. He will promote you to the rank of Silencer thereafter. "}

I should have paid attention. \nSoon people disappeared. From their beds, from the fields, or from the road. We would just never see them return. Naturally, we suspected the residents of the mine, but no one felt strong enough to take up arms. \nThen my time came. I needed to travel to &lt;a href=\"Mournhold%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Mournhold&lt;/a&gt; to acquire supplies as my shipment had never arrived. Which, at the time, was strange since my man was always prompt. Barely any time had passed before I was set upon by shadowy figures in cloaks. They killed my &lt;a href=\"Horses%20%28Online%29\"&gt;horse&lt;/a&gt; and knocked me unconscious. When I awoke, I was locked in a cage, cold and wet. And here I will likely die.\nI hear chanting in the distance. And a high chittering sound from some unnatural beast. So, I must hurry. I leave my tailor shop to young Rilasi if she still lives. And young Meden if Rilasi has died. My home and all its contents should be distributed to any of the village in need. I know this is not our custom, but those who are left may need shelter. And my bar tab, I leave to barkeep Drinar, that hilarious old fool. \nPlease forgive and misspellings or smeared letters.

Once there the Nerevarine may enquire with the local inhabitants about Dalobar. The residents in Gnisis won't be able to tell the Nerevarine anything about Dalobar (despite her association with the town), however those in Maar Gan will tell a different tale.\nThe residents of Maar Gan will tell the Nerevarine that Dalobar may have been caught up in an ash storm as she was expected to arrive in the town a few days previously. It is suggested that he may have taken shelter in a local Tomb.\nFinding Dalobar.\nThe tomb the residents refer to is for the &lt;a href=\"Rothan%20Ancestral%20Tomb\"&gt;ancestors of Rothan&lt;/a&gt; and can be found to the west of Maar Gan. Inside the Tomb the Nerevarine will find Dalobar near to the entrance. He will reveal that he was indeed the victim of an ash storm and therefore took shelter in the Tomb. He will ask the Nerevarine to escort him to the shrine in Maar Gan. Having escorted him to the &lt;a href=\"Maar%20Gan%20Shrine%20%28Location%29\"&gt;shrine&lt;/a&gt;, the Nerevarine must return to Neminda in order to complete the quest."}

Using the shovel, Cyrus can then retrieve the leather poach that contains it.\nTo get the cartographer's map, Cyrus must first go to &lt;a href=\"J%27ffer%27s%20Books\"&gt;J'ffer's Books&lt;/a&gt; and buy \"&lt;a href=\"Elven%20Artifacts\"&gt;Elven Artifacts&lt;/a&gt;\" and then ask &lt;a href=\"Maiko\"&gt;Maiko&lt;/a&gt; to make a map from the books coordinates and notations. Frustrated by repeated previous requests to do this very thing, Maiko will only agree to make it if he's given the book so there will be one less copy around. After sometime has passed, Cyrus may return and be given the map.\nIf spoken to before about the flask, Falicia will mention that a silver boat supposedly contains a piece of the map. When Cyrus speaks to the local &lt;a href=\"Silversmith\"&gt;Silversmith&lt;/a&gt;, the owner &lt;a href=\"Krisandra\"&gt;Krisandra&lt;/a&gt; claims to have no such piece in her possession. However, across the street from her shop her house has noticeably been ransacked and entering reveals it perpetrators are Imperial guards. Facing off against them, Cyrus can return to Krisandra and she will offer the storeroom key where everything the previous owner kept, indigent that the Imperials would have done such a thing to a loyal &lt;a href=\"Forebear\"&gt;Forebear&lt;/a&gt;. After climbing some boxes, in the very back of the room is the chest containing the silver boat. Turning it upside down reveals that it does in fact contain a piece of the map on its underside.\nWith all pieces combined, Cyrus can head to &lt;a href=\"Saintsport%20%28Redguard%29\"&gt;Saintsport&lt;/a&gt;. The notation \"&lt;a href=\"Leki\"&gt;Leki&lt;/a&gt;\" refers to the town's wayshrine, with a mural of Leki on its ceiling with her hand pointing west. Altogether, the rout is 63 paces west and 16 paces south. The \"Long Tree\" is a red-herring, as no such tree exists. The chest is located on down the sandy slope roughly near the entrance to Saintsport. Using the shovel, Cyrus can unearth the chest containing the flask, now fully prepared to face off against the &lt;a href=\"Necromancy\"&gt;necromancer&lt;/a&gt; N'Gasta."}

They must acquire a &lt;a href=\"Welkynd%20Stone%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;Welkynd Stone&lt;/a&gt; and a spell that deals Shock damage. Then they must travel to &lt;a href=\"Cloud%20Top\"&gt;Cloud Top&lt;/a&gt;.

Attacking the pillar with the shock spell cause four lightning bolts to spring from the ruins to strike the pillar, creating a massive Shock blast in a decent radius around it. If the Hero survives, they will now possess the Finger of the Mountain spell. This action will not consume the Welkynd Stone.\nIt is recommended that one use a defensive buff of some sort to endure the damage successfully if still low level. Alternatively, one can activate the ruin from a distance with a ranged Shock spell and simply stand outside the blast radius.\nIt might be hard to trigger the stone with a touch based shock spell. In that case just buy a scroll of shock that can be used from afar.\nThe spell that hits the Hero:\nSpell statistics.\nFinger of the Mountain requires a &lt;a href=\"Destruction%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;Destruction&lt;/a&gt; skill relative to your level. It is a ranged Shock spell with variable damage and radius, depending on your level. It is also quite reliable as a standard attack spell for quite some time later. Higher levels of the spell may cost too much for most characters to cast through normal means. It is less tactically useful for those who use &lt;a href=\"Conjuration%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;Conjuration&lt;/a&gt; as well, due to the lack of Shock-resistant summons in the early-to-middle game."}

Apparently the Ayleids possessed a magical method of absorbing lightning bolts and converting them into magical energy. This naturally required a magical device (the pillar) placed at a high point to absorb as many as possible.\n\"Fingers of the Mountain\" is thus a poetic way of describing the natural lightning that would repeatedly strike such high locations. It should be noted that gaining the spell is likely a side effect of the original intent of the Ayleids as the pillar is broken and can not serve its intended purpose of drawing energy from lightning as a power source for other magics."}

Inge Six Fingers has asked me to recover the lute from their stronghold.\"\nWalkthrough.\nAfter the Dragonborn becomes a member of the &lt;a href=\"Bards%20College%20%28Skyrim%20Faction%29\"&gt;Bards College&lt;/a&gt;, faculty members will ask them to perform certain quests. Inge Six Fingers, the lute instructor, mentions that she is sad because thieves stole her precious historical relic, Finn's Lute, which she claims was the first eight-course lute ever invented.\nThe quest leads to Stony Creek Cave in southeastern &lt;a href=\"Eastmarch%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Eastmarch&lt;/a&gt;. Outside the cave is a pleasant small pond with a dock, fishing pole, and a boat. On entering, one can see a dead &lt;a href=\"Bretons%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Breton&lt;/a&gt; dangling over a railing and two skeletons in the water. One can proceed up the stream and kill the bandits defending their lair and its treasure.\nWhere the path splits, there is a door guard sitting at a desk watching the stream entrance; one can sneak by or take him out. Upstream is a &lt;a href=\"Bandits%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;bandit&lt;/a&gt; mining a moonstone ore deposit, and nearby there is a modest chest. Going past the door guard will lead to the bandit leader and some treasure, though one should watch out for a swing mace trap right before the final room.\nThe precious lute is in a chest with some random loot, along with a &lt;a href=\"Stone%20of%20Barenziah\"&gt;Stone of Barenziah&lt;/a&gt;, an Illusion Skill Book \"&lt;a href=\"Mystery%20of%20Talara%2C%20Book%20IV\"&gt;Mystery of Talara, Part 4&lt;/a&gt;\", some ingredients, and another fragment of the treasure map mystery, \"&lt;a href=\"Treasure%20Map%20X\"&gt;Treasure Map X&lt;/a&gt;\".\nTo complete the quest, one need only to bring the lute back to Inge, who is ecstatic at its return. Since she is unable to reward the Dragonborn with money, she teaches them \"a few tricks picked up on the road\" from Inge's younger years. This turns out to be one-point skill increases for Light Armor, Lockpicking, Speech, Sneak, Pickpocket and Alchemy.\nRewards.\n+1 skill point to all skills under &lt;a href=\"Skills%20%28Skyrim%29%23By%20class%20archetype\"&gt;the Thief&lt;/a&gt; (&lt;a href=\"Light%20Armor%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Light Armor&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Sneak%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Sneak&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Lockpicking%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Lockpicking&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Pickpocket\"&gt;Pickpocket&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Speech\"&gt;Speech&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Alchemy%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Alchemy&lt;/a&gt;)"}

With two hundred years invested into the search and the fourth runestone yet to be discovered since, there is currently no evidence supporting this theory.\nAcross &lt;a href=\"Tamriel\"&gt;Tamriel&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"Vestige\"&gt;Vestige&lt;/a&gt; may discover and acquire these runes scattered throughout the lands. By combining a runestone of each type at an &lt;a href=\"Enchanting%20Station\"&gt;Enchanting Station&lt;/a&gt;, the Vestige can craft powerful &lt;a href=\"Enchantments%20%28Online%29\"&gt;enchantment&lt;/a&gt; glyphs that can be applied to &lt;a href=\"Weapons%20%28Online%29\"&gt;weapons&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Armor%20%28Online%29\"&gt;armor&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Jewelry%20%28Online%29\"&gt;jewelry&lt;/a&gt;. Blue Potency Runes determine the base power of the enchantment, whether the enchantment is additive or subtractive, and the level of items it can be applied to; yellow Essence Runes determine the effect of the enchantment; and red Aspect Runes determine the quality of the glyph, ranging from Base quality to Legendary quality\u2014further improving the power of the enchantment."}

I admit with some embarrassment then that when I pulled it down from the shelf, I nearly choked on the dust that flew.\nThere is little to tell, but did suffer another awful nightmare of &lt;a href=\"Great%20War\"&gt;the war&lt;/a&gt;. I suppose this is an affliction common to many who must see the horrors of war firsthand. Writing about it has already helped me to feel better.\n19 Second Seed Received a letter from &lt;a href=\"Andurs\"&gt;Andurs&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Whiterun%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Whiterun&lt;/a&gt;. He has invited me to visit, and I intend to accept. It's been a long time since I was in the city.\nMy only fear is the &lt;a href=\"Thalmor%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Thalmor&lt;/a&gt;. I have heard that they and their agents are abroad in &lt;a href=\"Skyrim\"&gt;Skyrim&lt;/a&gt;, rooting out worshippers of &lt;a href=\"Talos\"&gt;Talos&lt;/a&gt;. I must be sure to keep a low profile.\n28 Second Seed Returned from my trip to Whiterun to find very few flowers have bloomed here. The rest of Skyrim is covered in blooms of fiery red and piercing blue, but only a scant few have appeared in or near the town.\nI'll make it my mission to change that. We could use some flowers to brighten this gloomy place. Perhaps I can get &lt;a href=\"Tekla\"&gt;Tekla&lt;/a&gt; to help me.\n9 Midyear Spent most of the day consoling &lt;a href=\"Lod\"&gt;Lod&lt;/a&gt;, who received news of his cousin Grimsvotr's death. They were quite close as youths, and Lod drank and talked of his childhood memories. It was touching, but bittersweet.\n22 Midyear A wandering peddler passed through &lt;a href=\"Falkreath%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Falkreath&lt;/a&gt; today. I purchased a few sticks of incense from him. He was a nice young &lt;a href=\"Nords%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Nord&lt;/a&gt; lad, following in his father's footsteps. I think his name was Valbjorn.\nA few days later, one of the town guards spied a pack of carrion birds circling near the road. He found young Valbjorn's corpse, victim of a bandit attack.\nMy heart is heavy, and yet I should know better. Life and death, growth and change, the turning of the seasons - these are all aspects of mighty &lt;a href=\"Arkay\"&gt;Arkay&lt;/a&gt;. I should not be so affected by the death of one young man. And yet...\n12 Sun's Height Travelers pass through town, speaking of the land in the grip of high summer. These are the warmest days of the year in Skyrim, but not in Falkreath. Here, all is mist and fog and rain. It is always cool and damp, and the seasons have little meaning.\n&lt;a href=\"Solaf\"&gt;Solaf&lt;/a&gt; asked me about this today. He said that in a place of the dead such as &lt;a href=\"Falkreath%20Graveyard\"&gt;our great cemetery&lt;/a&gt;, Arkay's dominion should be absolute. And yet, Arkay is also the Lord of Seasons and this place seems untouched by them.\nI gave the best answer I could. I explained that Falkreath is indeed a place of great power for Arkay, but he prefers to keep it this way, solemn and gray. Hopefully that was at least partly true, but who can possibly know the mind of a god?\n20 Sun's Height Dreams of the war again, but this time something different.\nI was leading a small band of &lt;a href=\"Aldmeri%20Dominion%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Aldmeri&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"battlemage\"&gt;battlemage&lt;/a&gt;s on a mission deep into the heart of &lt;a href=\"Imperial%20Legion%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Imperial&lt;/a&gt; territory. We had drawn near our target, a supply depot outside of &lt;a href=\"Cheydinhal%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;Cheydinhal&lt;/a&gt;, when the sky suddenly darkened.\nA great shadow passed over us, and there was a roar so terrible it chilled my blood. Something was flying just overhead, &lt;a href=\"Alduin%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;so huge and so dark&lt;/a&gt; as to blot out the sun.\nThe dream changed, then. I was here in Falkreath, performing a service for someone who had just passed away, though I do not recall who. From the corner of my eye, I saw a stranger approaching. I turned to look, but the shadow came again, and the roar, and then I awoke.\nNow that I reflect on the dream, I cannot help but wonder, was it a &lt;a href=\"Dragons%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;dragon&lt;/a&gt;? Why would I dream of such a creature, when I have never seen one? It seemed so real at the time, but now the memory is fading.\nWhat it means, I cannot say. Probably nothing."}

According to legend, he was formed around the time when the First Serpent shed its skin, creating &lt;a href=\"Satakal\"&gt;Satakal&lt;/a&gt;. He learned the Walkabout, a way of avoiding the cycle of Satakal eating itself by moving in strange angles and striding between the worldskins. Ruptga placed stars in the sky to help other, weaker spirits perform the Walkabout, and it became so easy that it became a place, called &lt;a href=\"The%20Far%20Shores\"&gt;The Far Shores&lt;/a&gt;.\nRuptga fathered so many children over the course of the cycles that he became known as Tall Papa. Most Prominent among his children are &lt;a href=\"Frandar%20Hunding\"&gt;Frandar Hunding&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Leki\"&gt;Leki&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Ansei\"&gt;Ansei&lt;/a&gt;. After many cycles, there were so many spirits that Tall Papa couldn't guide them all by himself anymore, so he created a helper out of the dead skins of previous worlds, called &lt;a href=\"Sep\"&gt;Sep&lt;/a&gt;. Sep still had much of the hunger of Satakal in him, and often ate the spirits he was supposed to help, though Tall Papa always got them out.\nSep eventually grew tired of helping Tall Papa and decided to trick the other spirits into creating a new world by balling up the remains of the old worlds, telling them that this new world would make it easier to get to the Far Shores. Tall Papa just shook his head at this.\nMany of the spirits who pertook in creating Sep's new world died, and those who remained found that the jump to the Far Shores was too far now. They pleaded with Tall Papa for help, but he just told them that they must now find new ways to follow the stars to the Far Shores, or else live on through their children. Sep, however, required punishment, so Tall Papa squashed him with a stick. Sep is now stuck roaming Nirn while the other spirits can strive back for godhood, as a \"non-space\" that jealously tries to eat the stars Tall Papa has placed.\nTrivia.\nRuptga or Tall Papa, is similar to , a god in .

After arriving on the island, Rurelion, Gathwen, and &lt;a href=\"Ealcil\"&gt;Ealcil&lt;/a&gt;\u2014another scholar from the Dominion\u2014were told about the Temple of the Mourning Springs by the locals and embarked on an exposition. There, they found an artifact\u2014the &lt;a href=\"Mourning%20Stone\"&gt;Mourning Stone&lt;/a&gt;\u2014which can create seemingly infinite reserves of water. After removing the stone, the party was descended upon by numerous &lt;a href=\"Undead%20%28Online%29\"&gt;undead&lt;/a&gt;, scattering them; Rurelion was left trapped inside the temple, where Uldor took control of him.\nPersonality.\nWhile possessed by Uldor, Rurelion appears to be completely sedated, but resists the Moarmer's control; eventually, he breaks free, showing that he is both strong-willed and determined. In the Great Hall, despite just breaking out of Uldor's grip, he is calm and collected, knowing that he has to maintain a level head in the situation. He is ready to act for the greater good, volunteering to sacrifice himself to keep &lt;a href=\"Eagle%27s%20Strand\"&gt;Eagle's Strand&lt;/a&gt; and Khenarthi's Roost safe, and recognizes when others act similarly, calling the &lt;a href=\"Vestige\"&gt;Vestige&lt;/a&gt;, \"friend,\" if they agrees to his plan. In addition, he shows care towards his apprentice, not wanting her to be trapped with Uldor. He also states that she will be more powerful than him, and that he is proud of her.\nInteractions.\n&lt;a href=\"Tears%20of%20the%20Two%20Moons\"&gt;Tears of the Two Moons&lt;/a&gt;.\nGathwen recruits the Vestige to get Rurelion back, but the two are stopped by a skeleton, who says that Rurelion is under his control; he is later revealed to be named Uldor. After solving the puzzle in the Temple Catacombs, the two find a strange-looking Rurelion; he will state that he is actually Uldor, and that he enjoys the magic that pulses through his new \"puppet.\" Rurelion is being controlled by the Moarmer, and the Altmer's magic is Uldor's edge in summoning more &lt;a href=\"Undead%20%28Online%29\"&gt;undead&lt;/a&gt;. After the Vestige defeats numerous skeletons to stop the ritual, Rurelion begins fighting off Uldor's control, rushing out of the room as they mentally battle.\nIn the Great Hall, Rurelion can be found at the end, near the stairwell to Uldor's Tomb. He will explain that he has cast the undead sorcerer into the tomb, but the spirit won't be there long. He comes up with a plan to distract Uldor by submitting himself to the Moarmer's control while the Vestige places the Tears of the Two Moons, which Rurelion hands over. He tells that Gathwen should get the Mourning Stone, which will seal himself and Uldor in the tomb forever. When she hears of the idea, she volunteers to be the distraction, and asks that Rurelion be left to get the Mourning Stone instead. The Vestige must choose whether to seal either Rurelion or Gathwen inside the tomb.\nIf Rurelion is chosen to be sacrificed, he will enter the tomb first, telling Uldor that he won't fight. After the four stones have been placed on their consequent pedestals, Uldor will temporarily be silenced, allowing for Rurelion to thank the Vestige a final time, bidding them farewell. He will be trapped in the temple from that point on.\nIf Gathwen is chosen, Rurelion will get the Mourning Stone from Eagle's Strand begrudgingly. Once the Vestige emerges from the tomb, he will swear to free Gathwen from Uldor eventually, giving the Vestige the &lt;a href=\"Mourning%20Bow\"&gt;Mourning Bow&lt;/a&gt; and a leveled amount of gold.\n&lt;a href=\"The%20Tempest%20Unleashed\"&gt;The Tempest Unleashed&lt;/a&gt;.\nIf Rurelion is chosen to live, then he will offer to fight alongside the Vestige against the &lt;a href=\"Sea%20Vipers\"&gt;Sea Vipers&lt;/a&gt;.\nConversations.\nFighting off Uldor:\nUldor: \"\"Stay back!\"\nRurelion: \"\"Uldor! Get out of my body, now!\"\nUldor: \"\"Silence! None command Uldor!\" \nBanishing Uldor:\nRurelion: \"\"Uldor, I command you! By the Tears of the Two Moons, return to your prison!\"\nUldor: \"\"Ahh! That won't hold me for long!\" \nIf Gathwen is chosen to be sacrificed:\nRurelion: \"\"Gathwen, I beg you to reconsider.\"\nGathwen \"You're too important, Rurelion. If the Dominion lost you, we could be lost.\"\nRurelion: \"\"Then I will recover the Mourning Stone! Farewell, my dearest friend.\"\nGathwen: \"Farewell, Rurelion.\"\nIf Rurelion is chosen:\nGathwen: \"\"You can't do this, master!\"\nRurelion: \"\"The Dominion will thrive without me. It's far stronger than it knows.\nGathwen: \"\"Then I should recover the Mourning Stone. Farewell, Rurelion. I \u2026.\"\nRurelion: \"\"I know Gathwen \u2026 I know. Give me a moment to collect myself. I'll be right behind you.\" \nUpon Approaching Uldor (if Rurelion is chosen):\nRurelion: \"\"I've reconsidered what our combined power can do, Uldor. I willingly give myself over.\"\nUldor: \"\"I knew such power would tempt you. Very well.\"\nRurelion: \"\"Hurry! Place the Tears of the Two Moons in the pedestals!\" \nUldor: \"\"Wretched fool!

He will ask you to go check on them to see if everything is going all right. \nHead to the east side of the vale and you will find &lt;a href=\"Balin%20Remly\"&gt;Balin Remly&lt;/a&gt; stuck in one of his own Harpy trap. Free him, then talk to him again and he will tell you about how they were trapping Harpies; his brother &lt;a href=\"Armel%20Remly\"&gt;Armel Remly&lt;/a&gt; put down scent lures to lure in the harpies and then Balin would place the traps near them. Balin will ask you to place the rest of the traps while he heads back to Bumnog. He also asks you to look for his brother and find out what happened to him.\nYou will find three scent lures throughout the area. For the first one, head through the path up the cliff from where you found Balin. The second one is a bit further down that path, at the crossroads. You will find Armel on the cliff just north of this scent trap, being harassed by a harpy. Kill the harpy, and Armel will head back to the village. Finally, take the path west to find the third lure. It will be by the big rock formation. \nAfter all the traps have been placed and Armel has been saved, head south to the village. In one of the cave dwellings, you will witness a discussion between &lt;a href=\"Makar%20the%20Elder\"&gt;Makar the Elder&lt;/a&gt; and the Remly brothers. She will express her dissatisfaction with their work, after which Bumnog will come in and tell everyone that the harpies are attacking the village; Balin and Armel have gotten too much of the lure scent on them during their work, and have lured the harpies in. The villagers will hide from the beasts while the Remly brothers go wash themselves; follow the brothers to the pond and protect them from the harpies while they wash up. \nOnce the harpies have been dealt with, head back to the Elder's dwelling. Bumnog will be waiting outside; if you speak with him, he will ask you to tell the elder that he and his group were primarily responsible for taking care of the harpies. He will tell you that most of their jobs do not go as poorly as this one, and that it would greatly damage their reputation if word got out about this botched job. After you are done talking to him, head inside and speak with Makar the Elder. You can either tell her the truth and say that you did most of the work, or you can lie that the others did what they were hired to do. Either way, this will end the quest."}

To this end, he searched for the &lt;a href=\"Mnemic%20Egg\"&gt;Mnemic Egg&lt;/a&gt;, an ancient artifact that was the physical link between the &lt;a href=\"Argonians%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Argonians&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Hist\"&gt;Hist&lt;/a&gt;.\nInteractions.\n&lt;a href=\"The%20Skin-Stealer%27s%20Lair\"&gt;The Skin-Stealer's Lair&lt;/a&gt;.\nRuuvitar's forces began their incursion into Shadowfen by using a &lt;a href=\"Dremora%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Dremora&lt;/a&gt; named &lt;a href=\"Lyranth\"&gt;Lyranth&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Hist%20Sap%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Hist Sap&lt;/a&gt; to create skin-stealer potion, an elixir that not only gave the drinker the appearance of their victim, but also their memories. This allowed the drinker to perfectly impersonate the victim. They began by killing and impersonating townsfolk in Stormhold, then moving on to high-ranking officials such as &lt;a href=\"Vicecanon%20Hrondar\"&gt;Vicecanon Hrondar&lt;/a&gt;. The &lt;a href=\"Vestige\"&gt;Vestige&lt;/a&gt; was able to disrupt their operations in the city and also discovered Hrondar was an imposter. The &lt;a href=\"Ebonheart%20Pact\"&gt;Ebonheart Pact&lt;/a&gt; was now aware of the Dominion presence in Shadowfen and began mobilizing their forces.\n&lt;a href=\"Keepers%20of%20the%20Shell\"&gt;Keepers of the Shell&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Outside%20Interference\"&gt;Outside Interference&lt;/a&gt;.\nRuuvitar then sent his forces to secure the Hatching Pools, where Argonians eggs were laid beneath a Hist Tree before the hatched. Using the Mnemic Egg, he severed the link between the Hist and Argonians, causing nearly all the unborn Argonians in their eggs to die, save for a few that were saved by the Vestige and &lt;a href=\"Keeper%20Uxith-Ei\"&gt;Keeper Uxith-Ei&lt;/a&gt; using an unknown ritual. Shortly after the slaughter, Pact forces arrived and recaptured the Hatching Pools.\n&lt;a href=\"The%20Dominion%27s%20Alchemist\"&gt;The Dominion's Alchemist&lt;/a&gt;.\nAfter his success at the Hatching Pools, Ruuvitar desired to recreate the ritual he'd used on a larger scale, to prevent all Argonian births in all of Black Marsh. He moved the Mnemic Egg to the &lt;a href=\"Ayleid%20Ruins%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Ayleid ruin&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"Loriasel\"&gt;Loriasel&lt;/a&gt;. There his forces came under attack from &lt;a href=\"Lamia%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Lamia&lt;/a&gt;. Ruuvitar used his magic to seal himself, the egg, and several Argonian prisoners he could experiment on inside the ruin's inner sanctum, leaving all his soldiers to be killed by Lamia and the Pact forces converging on the ruins.\nOne Dominion soldier, a &lt;a href=\"Khajiit%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Khajiit&lt;/a&gt; named &lt;a href=\"Kazdi\"&gt;Kazdi&lt;/a&gt;, hated Ruuvitar even before he left her to die. When the Vestige entered the ruins, she aided them in unlocking the inner sanctum to get back at Ruuvitar. The Vestige and Vicecanon &lt;a href=\"Heita-Meen\"&gt;Heita-Meen&lt;/a&gt; then confronted the Dominion leader and slew him.\n&lt;a href=\"The%20Dream%20of%20the%20Hist\"&gt;The Dream of the Hist&lt;/a&gt;.\nStop Ruuvitar from using the &lt;a href=\"Mnemic%20Egg\"&gt;Mnemic Egg&lt;/a&gt; to kill &lt;a href=\"Argonians%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Argonian&lt;/a&gt; hatchlings."}

After being lamed at the massacre of Stoop Low, he left Anaquina to keep from bringing shame to his tribe, eventually ending up in the far more cosmopolitan &lt;a href=\"Pellitine\"&gt;Pellitine&lt;/a&gt; to the south. For a time, S'rathra ran a lucrative &lt;a href=\"skooma\"&gt;skooma&lt;/a&gt; trade out of &lt;a href=\"Senchal\"&gt;Senchal&lt;/a&gt; port, smuggling sugar into the Empire (becoming, unfortunately, an addict himself in the process). When Cyrodiil strengthened its presence in the &lt;a href=\"Topal%20Bay\"&gt;Topal Bay&lt;/a&gt;, S'rathra left Elsweyr entirely.\"\n\"He has made &lt;a href=\"Wayrest\"&gt;Wayrest&lt;/a&gt; his port of late, playing the lesser lords of &lt;a href=\"High%20Rock\"&gt;High Rock&lt;/a&gt; to his benefit. Though the Empire has solidified the &lt;a href=\"Bretons\"&gt;Bretons&lt;/a&gt;, there is still a lot of money to be made in the drawing of borders before the provincial laws dry completely. Mercenaries and fixers are in great demand there, and &lt;a href=\"Cyrus%20%28Redguard%29\"&gt;Cyrus&lt;/a&gt; and S'rathra have long shared a mutually beneficial relationship- the catman finds the paying parties and the Redguard does the dirty work.\"\n\"S'rathra's latest assignment for Cyrus is cut short when the Redguard hears of his missing sister. The Khajiit, perhaps knowing all too well the loss of one's kin, provides the money and transport necessary for Cyrus to reach &lt;a href=\"Stros%20M%27kai\"&gt;Stros M'kai&lt;/a&gt;.\"\nInteractions.\n&lt;a href=\"Arriving%20on%20Stros%20M%27kai\"&gt;Arriving on Stros M'kai&lt;/a&gt;.\nDuring the intro cutscene, S'rathra is speaking to Cyrus. He will say that a letter came for him from Tobias about his sister, to which the seal was broken as S'rathra had read it as a precaution. Despite being assigned with Duadeen for a mission, S'rathra allows Cyrus to take a boat to &lt;a href=\"Stros%20M%27kai\"&gt;Stros M'kai&lt;/a&gt;."}

It used to be the capital of &lt;a href=\"Skyrim\"&gt;Skyrim&lt;/a&gt; and was built by &lt;a href=\"Ysgramor\"&gt;Ysgramor&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Atmoran\"&gt;Atmoran&lt;/a&gt; settlers, before it was &lt;a href=\"Night%20of%20Tears\"&gt;sacked&lt;/a&gt; by the &lt;a href=\"Snow%20Elves\"&gt;Snow Elves&lt;/a&gt;. It is the final resting place of\u00a0&lt;a href=\"Jyrik%20Gauldurson\"&gt;Jyrik Gauldurson&lt;/a&gt;, one of the three brothers related to the side quest \"&lt;a href=\"Forbidden%20Legend\"&gt;Forbidden Legend&lt;/a&gt;.\"\nHistory.\nIt was once the capital city of the &lt;a href=\"Atmoran\"&gt;Atmoran&lt;/a&gt;s, founded by Ysgramor. It was one of the first cities established by &lt;a href=\"men\"&gt;men&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Tamriel\"&gt;Tamriel&lt;/a&gt;. The Snow Elves destroyed the city in what would come to be known as the &lt;a href=\"Night%20of%20Tears\"&gt;Night of Tears&lt;/a&gt;, and only Ysgramor and his two sons escaped during the carnage.\nLater, the destruction of this city would be avenged when Ysgramor returned with his famed warriors, the &lt;a href=\"Five%20Hundred%20Companions\"&gt;Five Hundred Companions&lt;/a&gt;.\u00a0The famed enchanter known as\u00a0&lt;a href=\"Ahzidal\"&gt;Ahzidal&lt;/a&gt;\u00a0heard of the arrival of Ysgramor and the Five Hundred, he went to them, and offered his services to him and his army. With steel imbued with powerful enchantments, Ysgramor, the Five Hundred Companions and Ahzidal began to hunt down the remaining Snow Elves across &lt;a href=\"Skyrim\"&gt;Skyrim&lt;/a&gt;\u00a0and\u00a0&lt;a href=\"Solstheim%20%28Dragonborn%29\"&gt;Solstheim&lt;/a&gt;, and a war would begin between the two races. The Five Hundred Companions eventually won, with the vast majority of the Snow Elves dying in the line of duty. Archaeologist Floronius discovered that the Snow Elves had an intricate understanding of the city's layout before launching their assault. The battle which destroyed Saarthal may have been related to the \"&lt;a href=\"Eye%20of%20Magnus\"&gt;Eye of Magnus&lt;/a&gt;,\" which the Snow Elves held dear to their culture.\nInteractions.\n&lt;a href=\"Under%20Saarthal\"&gt;Under Saarthal&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Last%20Dragonborn\"&gt;Dragonborn&lt;/a&gt; visits this location with three other mage-apprentices after joining the &lt;a href=\"College%20of%20Winterhold%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;College of Winterhold&lt;/a&gt;. First, they are instructed to help a fellow College of Winterhold scholar, &lt;a href=\"Arniel%20Gane\"&gt;Arniel Gane&lt;/a&gt;, to retrieve 4 enchanted artifacts from various locations in the ruins.\nDoing so, the &lt;a href=\"Saarthal%20Amulet\"&gt;Saarthal Amulet&lt;/a&gt; is discovered. When the amulet is worn and a spell is cast towards the door it opens to a burial chamber. Along with &lt;a href=\"Tolfdir%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Tolfdir&lt;/a&gt;, the Dragonborn enters the room where they see a vision of &lt;a href=\"Nerien\"&gt;Nerien&lt;/a&gt;, a member of &lt;a href=\"Psijic%20Order\"&gt;Psijic Order&lt;/a&gt;. If the location is visited before \"Under Saarthal,\" the door to the inner rooms remains locked.\nNerein warns that the Eye of Magnus, an &lt;a href=\"Artifacts%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;artifact&lt;/a&gt; found within, must be obtained and protected by the College of Winterhold, because interested parties want to exploit its power. The Dragonborn and Tolfdir discover the device, and slay the &lt;a href=\"Draugr%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Draugr&lt;/a&gt; protecting it. Afterwards, the Dragonborn rushes back to the college to warn &lt;a href=\"Arch-Mage\"&gt;Arch-Mage&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Savos%20Aren\"&gt;Savos Aren&lt;/a&gt; of the discovery.\nSolving the puzzle.\nThe first puzzle with the &lt;a href=\"Pillar%20Puzzle\"&gt;rotating pillars&lt;/a&gt; is solved by discovering the animal symbol behind each pillar. This can be done by carefully looking at the wall while using a &lt;a href=\"Torch%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;torch&lt;/a&gt; or casting &lt;a href=\"Magelight%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Magelight&lt;/a&gt; or the &lt;a href=\"Candlelight%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Candlelight&lt;/a&gt; spell, or turning up the game's lighting via the Settings menu.\nThe second puzzle is solved by rotating pillars in a certain order. Activating certain pillars will rotate a number of the others. The pillar on the left closest to the door will turn all of the other pillars, the pillar on the left furthest from the door will turn both of the pillars on the right, the pillar on the right closest to the door will turn the pillar in front of it and the pillar on the right furthest from the door will not turn any other pillars. The pillars should be activated in descending order of how many other pillars will turn with them, and should be set to (in that order): whale, snake, hawk, whale.\n&lt;a href=\"Forbidden%20Legend\"&gt;Forbidden Legend&lt;/a&gt;.\nAfter stealing his share of &lt;a href=\"Gauldur\"&gt;his father's&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Gauldur%20Amulet%20Fragment\"&gt;amulet&lt;/a&gt;, Jyrik Gauldurson fled to Saarthal, and was eventually defeated in battle there and was entombed within Saarthal, bound by a &lt;a href=\"Writ%20of%20Sealing\"&gt;Writ of Sealing&lt;/a&gt;.

It is also possible to contract the disease &lt;a href=\"Witbane%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Witbane&lt;/a&gt; from them. The quest \"&lt;a href=\"Animal%20Extermination\"&gt;Animal Extermination&lt;/a&gt;\" may require a sabre cat to be killed.\nPhysical appearance.\nThe standard sabre cat has reddish-brown fur which helps it blend into grassy regions. The snowy version of the sabre cat has spotted white fur which it uses more for stalking than its cousin in the plains. Snowy sabre cats are typically found in the northern regions of Skyrim (as well as other snowy areas), especially around &lt;a href=\"Dawnstar%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Dawnstar&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Winterhold%20%28Skyrim%20City%29\"&gt;Winterhold&lt;/a&gt;.\nBehavior.\nThey occasionally travel in groups of two or three, though they usually travel alone. Once a sabre cat catches sight of prey, it will crouch and slowly move towards it until pouncing at the right moment. Due to their camouflaged coats, they can easily ambush an unwary traveller. They may lurk in nooks under hills just off the road, poised to ambush anyone who walks by. They rarely follow prey into water, so only a river that is deep enough to swim in can be used as an escape route. They are susceptible to &lt;a href=\"Command%20Animal\"&gt;Command Animal&lt;/a&gt;, and are sometimes summoned by &lt;a href=\"Spriggan%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;spriggans&lt;/a&gt;.\nVariants.\n&lt;a href=\"Snowy%20Sabre%20Cat%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Snowy Sabre Cat&lt;/a&gt;.\nIn addition to the standard sabre cat, there is a subspecies known as the snowy sabre cat, which is much stronger and lives in snow-covered areas, like the regions around &lt;a href=\"Windhelm%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Windhelm&lt;/a&gt; and Winterhold. They can be distinguished from regular sabre cats by their cream colored coat.\nSabre Cat Guardian Spirit.\nA spectral sabre cat, that is also bigger and tougher, and is only encountered in the quest \"&lt;a href=\"Kyne%27s%20Sacred%20Trials\"&gt;Kyne's Sacred Trials&lt;/a&gt;.\" It is located on the shore of the &lt;a href=\"Sea%20of%20Ghosts\"&gt;Sea of Ghosts&lt;/a&gt; near the glaciers' edge.\n&lt;a href=\"Vale%20Sabre%20Cat\"&gt;Vale Sabre Cat&lt;/a&gt;.\n adds another subspecies, the vale sabre cat, found in &lt;a href=\"Darkfall%20Cave\"&gt;Darkfall Cave&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Forgotten%20Vale\"&gt;Forgotten Vale&lt;/a&gt;. They can be distinguished from the regular sabre cats by their purple and brown mottled coat."}

Over time I have deliberately crept closer and closer to the limits of their tribal camp, occasionally showing myself briefly so the subjects would become used to my proximity. At one point a warrior out to relieve himself behind a tree stumbled upon my observation post, and when he grunted and drew his crude-but-serviceable short sword I thought my work had come to an untimely end. Luckily the tribal shaman was nearby, and he intervened on my behalf, speaking harshly to the warrior and knocking aside his sword. The &lt;a href=\"Goblin%20Shaman\"&gt;shaman&lt;/a&gt; pointed at me and slowly rotated his hand near his head, which I assume is a &lt;a href=\"Goblin%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Goblin&lt;/a&gt; gesture denoting acknowledgement of superior intellect. Who would have suspected these so-called primitives had such regard for scholarship?\nAfter that there were no more incidents of hostility, and the Goblins tolerated my presence, so long as I kept a respectful distance from their females and offspring. Occasionally a warrior would bark at me, but I simply replied by making the hand-rotating \"intelligence\" gesture next to my head, and the warrior would shrug and go back to his business.\nAs so little is known about the religious practices of the Goblin race, I decided to make the shaman of the tribe my particular study. The symbol of his office was a bone rod, probably a femur, with a small skull affixed to the end\u2014possibly an infant's. This skull was ornamented with an assortment of feathers, spines, and animal claws, and filled with something like nut-hulls, for it rattled loudly when shaken. The shaman would shake this holy symbol forcefully when summoning his congregation to sacred rituals, or when the females were not bringing him food or drink rapidly enough.\nAt particularly important rituals the shaman would touch they symbol to his heart, then his head, then point it to the sky and call out, \"&lt;a href=\"Muluk\"&gt;Muluk&lt;/a&gt;!\" At first I found this confusing, given the similarity of \"muluk\" to the Goblin words \"muulk,\" which they use when chastising their &lt;a href=\"Durzog%20%28Online%29\"&gt;durzogs&lt;/a&gt; or children, or \"mluku,\" the term for fecal matter. But gradually I learned to differentiate, and one day I realized that by crying \"Muluk!\" the shaman must be invoking the god of the Goblins.\nAnd then it struck me: \"Muluk\" is not really much different from \"&lt;a href=\"Mauloch\"&gt;Mauloch&lt;/a&gt;.\" Could the god of the Goblins and the god of the &lt;a href=\"Orsimer%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Orcs&lt;/a&gt; be one and the same?\nThis is the kind of discovery that could win me tenure at the &lt;a href=\"College%20of%20Wayrest\"&gt;College of Wayrest&lt;/a&gt;! I must get independent confirmation of this revelation. But how?"}

And I never will again.\nI am a writer, a poet of some small renown. If I told you my name, you may have heard of me, but very likely, not. For decades until very recently, I had adopted the city of &lt;a href=\"Sentinel\"&gt;Sentinel&lt;/a&gt; on the coast of &lt;a href=\"Hammerfell\"&gt;Hammerfell&lt;/a&gt; as my home, and kept the company of other artists, painters, tapestrists, and writers. No one I knew would have known an assassin by sight, least of all the queen of them, the Blood Flower, the Lady Death, the Night Mother.\nNot that I had not heard of her.\nSome years ago, I had the good fortune of meeting &lt;a href=\"Pellarne%20Assi\"&gt;Pellarne Assi&lt;/a&gt;, a respected scholar, who had come to Hammerfell to do research for a book about the &lt;a href=\"Order%20of%20Diagna\"&gt;Order of Diagna&lt;/a&gt;. His essay, &lt;a href=\"The%20Brothers%20of%20Darkness\"&gt;The Brothers of Darkness&lt;/a&gt; together with &lt;a href=\"Ynir%20Gorming\"&gt;Ynir Gorming&lt;/a&gt;'s &lt;a href=\"Fire%20and%20Darkness\"&gt;Fire and Darkness: The Brotherhoods of Death&lt;/a&gt; are considered to be the canon tomes on the subject of &lt;a href=\"Tamriel\"&gt;Tamriel&lt;/a&gt;'s orders of assassins. By luck, Gorming himself was also in Sentinel, and I was privileged to sit with the two in a dark &lt;a href=\"skooma\"&gt;skooma&lt;/a&gt; den in the musty slums of the city, as we smoked and talked about the Dark Brotherhood, the Morag Tong, and the Night Mother.\nWhile not disputing the possibility that the Night Mother may be immortal or at least very long-lived, Assi thought it most likely that several women - and perhaps some men - throughout the ages had assumed the honorary title. It was no more logical to say there was only one Night Mother, he asserted, than to say there was only one King of Sentinel.\nGorming argued that there never was a Night Mother, at least no human one. The Night Mother was &lt;a href=\"Mephala\"&gt;Mephala&lt;/a&gt; herself, whom the Brotherhood revered second only to &lt;a href=\"Sithis\"&gt;Sithis&lt;/a&gt;.\n'I don't suppose there's any way of knowing for certain,' I said, in a note of diplomacy.\n'Certainly there is,' whispered Gorming with a grin. 'You could talk to that cloaked fellow in the corner.'\nI had not noticed the man before, who sat by himself, eyes hidden by his cloak, seemingly as much a part of the dingy place as the rough stone and unswept floor. Turning back to Ynir, I asked him why that man would know about the Night Mother.\n'He's a Dark Brother,' hissed Pellarne Assi. 'That's as plain as the moons. Don't even joke about speaking with him about Her.'\nWe moved on to other arguments about the &lt;a href=\"Morag%20Tong\"&gt;Morag Tong&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Dark%20Brotherhood\"&gt;Brotherhood&lt;/a&gt;, but I never forgot the image of the lone man, looking at nothing and everything, in the corner of the dirty room, with fumes of skooma smoke floating around him like ghosts. When I saw him weeks later on the streets of Sentinel, I followed him.\nYes, I followed him. The reader may reasonably ask 'why' and 'how.' I don't blame you for that.\n'How' was simply a question of knowing my city as well as I do. I'm not a thief, not particularly sure-footed and quiet, but I know the alleys and streets of Sentinel intimately from decades worth of ambling. I know which bridges creak, which buildings cast long irregular shadows, the intervals at which the native birds begin the ululations of their evening songs. With relative ease, I kept pace with the Dark Brother and out of his sight and hearing.\nThe answer to 'Why' is even simpler. I have the natural curiosity of the born writer. When I see a strange new animal, I must observe. It is the writer's curse.\nI trailed the cloaked man deeper into the city, down an alleyway so narrow it was scarcely a crack between two tenements, past a crooked fence, and suddenly, miraculously, I was in a place I had never seen before. A little courtyard cemetery, with a dozen old half-rotted wooden tombstones. None of the surrounding buildings had windows that faced it, so no one knew this miniature necropolis existed.\nNo one, except the six men and one woman standing in it. And me.\nThe woman saw me immediately, and gestured for me to come closer. I could have run, but - no, I couldn't have. I had pierced a mystery right in my adopted Sentinel, and I could not leave it.\nShe knew my name, and she said it with a sweet smile. The Night Mother was a little old lady with fluffy white hair, cheeks like wrinkled apples that still carried the flush of youth, friendly eyes, blue as the &lt;a href=\"Iliac%20Bay\"&gt;Iliac Bay&lt;/a&gt;. She softly took my arm as we sat down amidst the graves and discussed murder.\nShe was not always in Hammerfell, not always available for direct assignment, but it seemed she enjoyed actually talking to her clientele.\n'I did not come here to hire the Brotherhood,' I said respectfully.\n'Then why are you here?' the Night Mother asked, her eyes never leaving mine.\nI told her I wanted to know about her. I did not expect an answer to that, but she told me.\n'I do not mind the stories you writers dream up about me,' she chuckled. 'Some of them are very amusing, and some of them are good for business. I like the sexy dark woman lounging on the divan in &lt;a href=\"Carlovac%20Townway\"&gt;Carlovac Townway&lt;/a&gt;'s fiction particularly. The truth is that my history would not make a very dramatic tale. I was a thief, long, long ago, back when the &lt;a href=\"Thieves%20Guild\"&gt;Thieves Guild&lt;/a&gt; was only beginning. It's such a bother to sneak around a house when performing a burglary, and many of us found it most efficacious to strangle the occupant of the house. Just for convenience. I suggested to the Guild that a segment of our order be dedicated to the arts and sciences of murder.\n'It did not seem like such a controversial idea to me,' the Night Mother shrugged. 'We had specialists in catburglary, pick-pocketing, lock-picking, fencing, all the other essential parts of the job. But the Guild thought that encouraging murder would be bad for business. Too much, too much, they argued.\n'They might have been right,' the old woman continued. 'But I discovered there is a profit to be made, just the same, from sudden death. Not only can one rob the deceased, but, if your victim has enemies, which rich people often do, you can be paid for it even more. I began to murder people differently when I discovered that. After I strangled them, I would put two stones in their eyes, one black and one white.'\n'Why?' I asked.\n'It was a sort of calling card of mine. You're a writer - don't you want your name on your books? I couldn't use my name, but I wanted potential clients to know me and my work. I don't do it anymore, no need to, but at the time, it was my signature. Word spread, and I soon had quite a successful business.'\n'And that became the Morag Tong?' I asked.\n'Oh, dear me, no,' the Night Mother smiled. 'The Morag Tong was around long before my time. I know I'm old, but I'm not that old. I merely hired on some of their assassins when they began to fall apart after the murder of the last &lt;a href=\"Potentate\"&gt;Potentate&lt;/a&gt;. They did not want to be members of the Tong anymore, and since I was the only other murder syndicate of any note, they just joined on.'\nI phrased my next question carefully. 'Will you kill me now that you've told me all this?'\nShe nodded sadly, letting out a little grandmotherly sigh. 'You are such a nice, polite young man, I hate to end our acquaintanceship. I don't suppose you would agree to a concession or two in exchange for your life, would you?'\nTo my everlasting shame, I did agree. I said I would say nothing about our meeting, which, as the reader can see, was a promise I eventually, years later, chose not to keep. Why have I endangered my life thus?\nBecause of the promises I did keep.\nI helped the Night Mother and the Dark Brotherhood in acts too despicable, too bloody for me to set to paper. My hand quivers as I think about the people I betrayed, beginning with that night. I tried to write my poetry, but ink seemed to turn to blood. Finally, I fled, changing my name, going to a land where no one would know me.\nAnd I wrote this. The true history of the Night Mother, from the interview she gave me on the night we met. It will be the last thing I ever write, this I know. And every word is true.\nPray for me.\nEditor's Note: Though originally published anonymously, the identity of the author has never been in serious doubt. Any layman familiar with the work of the poet Enric Milres will recognize Sacred Witness's familiar cadence and style in such books of his as &lt;a href=\"The%20Alik%27r\"&gt;The Alik'r&lt;/a&gt;. Shortly after publication, Milres was murdered, and his killer was never found. He had been strangled, and two stones, a black one and a white one, crushed into his eyesockets. Very brutally."}

Don't even joke about speaking with him about Her.\"\nWe moved on to other arguments about the Morag Tong and the Brotherhood, but I never forgot the image of the lone man, looking at nothing and everything, in the corner of the dirty room, with fumes of skooma smoke floating around him like ghosts. When I saw him weeks later on the streets of Sentinel, I followed him.\nYes, I followed him. The reader may reasonably ask \"why\" and \"how.\" I don't blame you for that.\n\"How\" was simply a question of knowing my city as well as I do. I'm not a thief, not particularly sure-footed and quiet, but I know the alleys and streets of Sentinel intimately from decades worth of ambling. I know which bridges creak, which buildings cast long irregular shadows, the intervals at which the native birds begin the ululations of their evening songs. With relative ease, I kept pace with the Dark Brother and out of his sight and hearing.\nThe answer to \"Why\" is even simpler. I have the natural curiosity of the born writer. When I see a strange new animal, I must observe. It is the writer's curse.\nI trailed the cloaked man deeper into the city, down an alleyway so narrow it was scarcely a crack between two tenements, past a crooked fence, and suddenly, miraculously, I was in a place I had never seen before. A little courtyard cemetery, with a dozen old half-rotted wooden tombstones. None of the surrounding buildings had windows that faced it, so no one knew this miniature necropolis existed.\nNo one, except the six men and one woman standing in it. And me.\nThe woman saw me immediately, and gestured for me to come closer. I could have run, but\u2014no, I couldn't have. I had pierced a mystery right in my adopted Sentinel, and I could not leave it.\nShe knew my name, and she said it with a sweet smile. The Night Mother was a little old lady with fluffy white hair, cheeks like wrinkled apples that still carried the flush of youth, friendly eyes, blue as the &lt;a href=\"Iliac%20Bay\"&gt;Iliac Bay&lt;/a&gt;. She softly took my arm as we sat down amidst the graves and discussed murder.\nShe was not always in Hammerfell, not always available for direct assignment, but it seemed she enjoyed actually talking to her clientele.\n\"I did not come here to hire the Brotherhood,\" I said respectfully.\n\"Then why are you here?\" the Night Mother asked, her eyes never leaving mine.\nI told her I wanted to know about her. I did not expect an answer to that, but she told me."}

I did not expect an answer to that, but she told me.\n\"I do not mind the stories you writers dream up about me,\" she chuckled. \"Some of them are very amusing, and some of them are good for business. I like the sexy dark woman lounging on the divan in &lt;a href=\"Carlovac%20Townway\"&gt;Carlovac Townway&lt;/a&gt;'s fiction particularly. The truth is that my history would not make a very dramatic tale. I was a thief, long, long ago, back when the &lt;a href=\"Thieves%20Guild%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Thieves Guild&lt;/a&gt; was only beginning. It's such a bother to sneak around a house when performing a burglary, and many of us found it most efficacious to strangle the occupant of the house. Just for convenience. I suggested to the Guild that a segment of our order be dedicated to the arts and sciences of murder.\n\"It did not seem like such a controversial idea to me,\" the Night Mother shrugged. \"We had specialists in catburglary, pick-pocketing, lock picking, fencing, all the other essential parts of the job. But the Guild thought that encouraging murder would be bad for business. Too much, too much, they argued.\n\"They might have been right,\" the old woman continued. \"But I discovered there is a profit to be made, just the same, from sudden death. Not only can one rob the deceased, but, if your victim has enemies, which rich people often do, you can be paid for it even more. I began to murder people differently when I discovered that. After I strangled them, I would put two stones in their eyes, one black and one white.\"\n\"Why?\" I asked.\n\"It was a sort of calling card of mine. You're a writer - don't you want your name on your books? I couldn't use my name, but I wanted potential clients to know me and my work. I don't do it anymore, no need to, but at the time, it was my signature. Word spread, and I soon had quite a successful business.\"\n\"And that became the &lt;a href=\"Morag%20Tong%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Morag Tong&lt;/a&gt;?\" I asked.\n\"Oh, dear me, no,\" the Night Mother smiled. \"The Morag Tong was around long before my time. I know I'm old, but I'm not that old. I merely hired on some of their assassins when they began to fall apart after the murder of the last Potentate. They did not want to be members of the Tong anymore, and since I was the only other murder syndicate of any note, they just joined on.\"\nI phrased my next question carefully. \"Will you kill me now that you've told me all this?\"\nShe nodded sadly, letting out a little grandmotherly sigh. \"You are such a nice, polite young man, I hate to end our acquaintanceship. I don't suppose you would agree to a concession or two in exchange for your life, would you?\"\nTo my everlasting shame, I did agree. I said I would say nothing about our meeting, which, as the reader can see, was a promise I eventually, years later, chose not to keep. Why have I endangered my life thus?\nBecause of the promises I did keep.\nI helped the Night Mother and the Dark Brotherhood in acts too despicable, too bloody for me to set to paper. My hand quivers as I think about the people I betrayed, beginning with that night. I tried to write my poetry, but ink seemed to turn to blood. Finally, I fled, changing my name, going to a land where no one would know me.\nAnd I wrote this. The true history of the Night Mother, from the interview she gave me on the night we met. It will be the last thing I ever write, this I know. And every word is true.\nPray for me.\n\u2014 Editor's Note: Though originally published anonymously, the identity of the author has never been in serious doubt. Any layman familiar with the work of the poet Enric Milres will recognize Sacred Witness's familiar cadence and style in such books of his as \"&lt;a href=\"The%20Alik%27r%20%28Second%20Era%29\"&gt;The Alik'r&lt;/a&gt;.\" Shortly after publication, Milres was murdered, and his killer was never found. He had been strangled, and two stones, a black one and a white one, crushed into his eyesockets. Very brutally."}

In response to your momentary whim of last week, which was to me as an ironclad order, I have prepared a report on the recent outbreak of unholy undeath in the northern &lt;a href=\"Alik%27r%20Desert%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Alik'r&lt;/a&gt;, and its unorthodox means of suppression.\nI have spoken before about the &lt;a href=\"Ash%27abah\"&gt;Ash'abah&lt;/a&gt;, a pariah tribe of the northern wastes who are shunned for their unclean interactions with our risen ancestors. Though their origins are ancient, the fact that such an aberration could persist into the modern era must be attributed to covert support by shameless elements of &lt;a href=\"the%20Forebears\"&gt;the Forebears&lt;/a&gt;, who tolerate the most outrageous non-traditional practices.\nThis hypothesis would seem to be validated by recent events, which I shall now have the honor to recount to Your Majesties. In &lt;a href=\"Sentinel%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Sentinel&lt;/a&gt;, the usurper &lt;a href=\"Fahara%27jad\"&gt;Fahara'jad&lt;/a&gt; had gathered to him a circle of advisors, some of whom were of untarnished reputation, but others of whom were known Forebear activists who had almost openly opposed the &lt;a href=\"Divines\"&gt;Divines&lt;/a&gt;-blessed rule of the late King &lt;a href=\"Ramzi\"&gt;Ramzi&lt;/a&gt; (may &lt;a href=\"Tu%27whacca\"&gt;Tu'whacca&lt;/a&gt; escort his soul to &lt;a href=\"the%20Far%20Shores\"&gt;the Far Shores&lt;/a&gt;). One of these questionable viziers, &lt;a href=\"Suturah\"&gt;Suturah&lt;/a&gt; by name, seems to have been not only a bad advisor, but also a secret necromancer. As far as our agents of the Bureau have been able to reconstruct it, this Suturah slew all of \"King\" Fahara'jad's other viziers, then reanimated them in an attempt to kill Fahara'jad himself. The attempt was a failure: Fahara'jad escaped, but so did Suturah.\nSuturah fled to the east, where he was joined by elements of the &lt;a href=\"Order%20of%20the%20Black%20Worm%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Cult of the Black Worm&lt;/a&gt; (which Your Majesties will recall from my report of 2nd Rain's Hand). Undead, mostly &lt;a href=\"Ra-Netu\"&gt;Ra-Netu&lt;/a&gt;, were raised in numbers from forgotten graveyards in the deep desert, and Suturah led his unclean minions back toward Sentinel.\nShockingly, our informants state that Fahara'jad contaminated himself by personally appealing to the pariah Ash'abah, asking them to intervene against Suturah. The Ash'abah headman, &lt;a href=\"Marimah\"&gt;Marimah&lt;/a&gt;, agreed, though we have been unable to discover what degrading terms were imposed upon Fahara'jad. In a surprise ambush the Ash'abah, using forbidden mystical means, destroyed Suturah's army of Ra-Netu. Suturah himself, it is said, fell under the blade of the exile Marimah.\nFahara'jad, of course, has been careful to stay quiet about his appeal to the Ash'abah, and has publicly thanked the Divines for holy intervention on Sentinel's behalf. I leave it to Your Majesties to decide if we should spread about the rumor of the Forebear usurper's impure meeting with the pariahs."}

Self-reliant and independent, agents devote themselves to personal goals, or to various patrons or causes.\nThe Agent is a &lt;a href=\"stealth\"&gt;stealth&lt;/a&gt;-oriented, minimal-combat class. The Agent is the only default &lt;a href=\"class\"&gt;class&lt;/a&gt; in without an &lt;a href=\"armor\"&gt;armor&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"skill\"&gt;skill&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"Alteration\"&gt;Alteration&lt;/a&gt; to cast &lt;a href=\"Shield%20%28Spell%29\"&gt;shield&lt;/a&gt; (with the exceptions of the &lt;a href=\"Acrobat\"&gt;Acrobat&lt;/a&gt;, who has &lt;a href=\"Block\"&gt;Block&lt;/a&gt; to prevent being hit with full force, and &lt;a href=\"Witchhunter\"&gt;Witchhunter&lt;/a&gt;, who has &lt;a href=\"conjuration\"&gt;conjuration&lt;/a&gt; and thus can conjure armor or creatures to take incoming damage). As such, it is paramount for the Agent to avoid &lt;a href=\"combat\"&gt;combat&lt;/a&gt; at all costs, or if combat is inevitable, to avoid being hit.\nTo prevent being forced into combat by &lt;a href=\"quest\"&gt;quest&lt;/a&gt;s, the Agent is skilled in &lt;a href=\"Speechcraft\"&gt;Speechcraft&lt;/a&gt;. This skill can allow for non-violent solutions to many quests (but not all) so is one of the most important for an Agent. Speechcraft can be augmented by the &lt;a href=\"Illusion\"&gt;Illusion&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"spells\"&gt;spell&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Charm%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;Charm&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href=\"Mercantile\"&gt;Mercantile&lt;/a&gt; is also important for the Agent, as the arrows needed for combat can be expensive, and are the only way an Agent can do damage.\nSecurity and &lt;a href=\"Sneak\"&gt;Sneak&lt;/a&gt; are also important for Agents. Security provides shortcuts through dungeons and buildings, hence avoiding combat. &lt;a href=\"Sneak\"&gt;Sneak&lt;/a&gt; is great for use in conjunction with &lt;a href=\"Marksman\"&gt;Marksman&lt;/a&gt;, but also allows for the Agent to bypass non-essential combat situations and to steal and pickpocket keys and quest items (as opposed to killing the person for the item). Sneak also provides the Agent with an alternative income other than adventuring in dungeons to gain loot (e.g. theft).\nCombat is often unavoidable, so the Agent is usually a skilled &lt;a href=\"Marksman\"&gt;Marksman&lt;/a&gt; and good at &lt;a href=\"Acrobatics\"&gt;Acrobatics&lt;/a&gt;. Bows are very effective when trying to avoid combat, especially when combined with sneak attacks and the use of &lt;a href=\"Acrobatics\"&gt;Acrobatics&lt;/a&gt; to avoid damage and jump to unreachable locations. The &lt;a href=\"Demoralize\"&gt;Demoralize&lt;/a&gt; spell effect is also useful when paired with Marksman, because demoralized targets will run in fear for the duration of the effect; it can be quite easy to hit the target with arrows as they flee or return to attack.\nAfter all this, one may wonder how an Agent can be considered on par with the other classes. The answer lies in the last and possibly the most powerful skill of the Agent: &lt;a href=\"Illusion\"&gt;Illusion&lt;/a&gt;. Aside from demoralize and charm mentioned above, Illusion gives the &lt;a href=\"Calm\"&gt;Calm&lt;/a&gt; spell to stop enemies from wanting to attack and &lt;a href=\"Invisibility\"&gt;Invisibility&lt;/a&gt; to stop people from being able to attack the player even if they wanted. &lt;a href=\"Silence\"&gt;Silence&lt;/a&gt; can force an otherwise powerful mage into using a melee weapon, like a &lt;a href=\"Daggers%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;dagger&lt;/a&gt;, which is much less deadly.\nAlso, the Agent is the only default class with both Illusion and Sneak, which is a very powerful combination. Sneaking can be augmented by the &lt;a href=\"Chameleon\"&gt;Chameleon&lt;/a&gt; spell, as well as gaining benefits from &lt;a href=\"Night-Eye\"&gt;Night-Eye&lt;/a&gt; while hiding in dark areas, and many powerful spells are most effective when cast from the shadows. &lt;a href=\"Frenzy\"&gt;Frenzy&lt;/a&gt; raises the target's inclination to attack, and if they wants to attack, but can't see the player, they will attack someone else. This is a useful situation to be in when fighting multiple enemies: To Frenzy one of them and let the two take each other out, while the caster can take on the now-weakened winner with a stealth attack. &lt;a href=\"Paralyze\"&gt;Paralyze&lt;/a&gt; is a very powerful spell effect for obvious reasons, as is &lt;a href=\"Command\"&gt;Command&lt;/a&gt;, as it allows for the player to take a break and let someone else do the fighting for them.\n&lt;a href=\"Khajiit\"&gt;Khajiit&lt;/a&gt; make for the best Agents, as they have bonuses in nearly all skills, besides Illusion. &lt;a href=\"Imperials\"&gt;Imperials&lt;/a&gt; can be too with a bit of training in Acrobatics."}

We must grab every opportunity as it presents itself. And that is exactly what I did today!\nI have long struggled under the outmoded ways of Shaman &lt;a href=\"Lashburr%20Tooth-Breaker\"&gt;Lashburr Tooth-Breaker&lt;/a&gt;. I sometimes think he was old even when the first stones were set into the world. He never listens to my suggestions, never wants to try anything new or different.\nBut the stones smile on those who are worthy! When the &lt;a href=\"Scaled%20Court\"&gt;Scaled Court&lt;/a&gt; entered our valley and demanded an audience with our goltragga, the chief &lt;a href=\"Braadoth\"&gt;Braadoth&lt;/a&gt;, Shaman Lashburr was outraged. He called for the deaths of the outsiders. But I knew that a fight with the Scaled Court was a fight we could not win.\nSo I listened to the wind as it whispered through the valley rock and knew what had to be done. I accused Lashburr of plotting to kill the chief, all in an effort to break the prophesised alliance before its bonds could forge. Chief Braadoth demanded to know what I was talking about, so I spun my lies and created an elaborate tale that stroked the goltragga's ego and sounded just perfect enough to be true.\nAnd because of my words, Braadoth welcomed the Scaled Court into our valley, as he ordered the death of sun and feathers for old Lashburr Tooth-Breaker.\nAs I prepared Lashburr for his punishment, Braadoth and Regent Cassipia, leader of the Scaled Court, discussed terms for an alliance and partnership. She seems extremely interested in our techniques for using body inks, as well as our skil at crafting armor. When Braadoth faltered, she did something that even I had not anticipated. She offered Braadoth a place of honor within the Scaled Court itself.\nNow our chief is also the Ophidian Exarch of Undulating Destruction, a fitting title for one as bold and powerful as Braadoth Rockborn. Perhaps there is a title of equal merit for Agganor - if I continue to listen to the stones and watch for further opportunities for advancement.\nLashburr was beaten and cut, bloodied once for each of the ten iron oaths of our people. Then he was left, bound to the rock and baking in the sun as the crows began to gather. As much as I would enjoy watching the old shaman finally meet his end, I must make sure to advise the chief and stand at his side as the negotiations with the Scaled Court continue. I will leave two guards to witness the old one's passing.\nI returned later to find Lashburr gone and the guards dead. So, the old shaman has a few tricks left in him. I should have expected as much. Still, what can one old, half-dead &lt;a href=\"Iron%20Orc%20Shaman\"&gt;Iron Orc Shaman&lt;/a&gt; do once he has been beaten and banished? Nothing! And I have more important things to do now that the alliance with the Scaled Court has been agreed upon and sealed. When I next pick up this tale, I hope to announce my new title as a regent in the Court, as well.\nI wonder what name the Serpent will bestow upon me for the service I have provided this day! "}

Simply put, characters with higher aggression are more likely to attack the player and other characters, while those low aggression may only fight back if attacked, or not at all. It can be modified temporarily by &lt;a href=\"frenzy\"&gt;frenzy&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Calm%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;calm&lt;/a&gt; spells, and permanently by quest scripts and the . It is an AI-exclusive trait and is invisible in-game.\nCharacteristics.\nAggression is much more straightforward than &lt;a href=\"Confidence%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;Confidence&lt;/a&gt;. Simply put, if a character's &lt;a href=\"disposition\"&gt;disposition&lt;/a&gt; toward another character (including the player), drops by more than five below their aggression rating, they will attack that character on sight. An aggression score of 0 therefore means the character will never attack anyone for any reason, even if their disposition toward a character drops into the negatives (which is possible, but not visible in the persuasion minigame). Conversely, a character with a score of 100 or higher will attack anyone they see, regardless of provocation, unless their disposition toward that character is 100. Those with aggression level 5 (the most common) or less will not attack unless provoked.\nIf a character's disposition towards an attacker is high enough to not fight back, but they don't flee (determined by a complex equation that encompasses that character's confidence), they will just stand there and take the beating. However, if that character's &lt;a href=\"responsibility\"&gt;responsibility&lt;/a&gt; is high enough, they will\u00a0report the assault."}

It is a troll and when killed will drop body parts of Svenja. Apparently Agnar came from &lt;a href=\"Solstheim\"&gt;Solstheim&lt;/a&gt; and was married to the Chief's daughter until the Matron's offspring killed everyone. A &lt;a href=\"Nerevarine\"&gt;champion&lt;/a&gt; then killed the Matron's offspring (which is your character, the &lt;a href=\"Nerevarine\"&gt;Nerevarine&lt;/a&gt;, if you completed the quest from the &lt;a href=\"Morrowind\"&gt;Morrowind&lt;/a&gt; expansion pack; ). Svenja had nightmares about the beast and they decided to track the Matron which obviously ended their lives. Her body parts are like &lt;a href=\"Mort%20Flesh\"&gt;Mort Flesh&lt;/a&gt;. Inside the Uderfrykte Matron, one can also find the enchanted &lt;a href=\"Frostwyrm\"&gt;Frostwyrm&lt;/a&gt; Bow (frost damage, 15) mentioned in the journal.\nPossible literary connection.\nThe events described in this journal are reminiscent of the story Beowulf, a traditional bard's tale of Europe. The only differences are that in Beowulf the same foreign hero (Beowulf) who defeats the monster ravaging the countryside also defeats the monster's mother. It would seem that in this world, however, Beowulf didn't finish the job... this is actually wrong... the reference to Beowulf would be correct, but in the journal it explains that the previous chieftain (actual player in ) is the one who slew the first monster.\nContents.\nEntry 1.\nWhen I took on the role of Chieftain of Thirsk, when I accepted the beautiful &lt;a href=\"Svenja%20Snow-Song\"&gt;Svenja Snow-Song&lt;/a&gt; as my advisor, and then my bride, I never imagined how quickly my life would change.\nI went to the isle of Solstheim for some much needed rest, and found it in the mead-soaked halls of Thirsk. But when I met Svenja, my sweet Svenja, I became entangled in an epic story the likes of which I had only read about in fables and childrens' tales.\nSvenja told me of the fateful night when a hideous creature known as the Uderfrykte attacked the mead hall, killing rampantly, leaving her the only survivor. The creature was slain by a champion, and Thirsk had its new chieftain, but it wasn't long before they moved on to some new challenge, some new adventure.\nAnd that's where I entered the tale. Svenja Snow-Song, with her ice-blue eyes and flaxon hair, gained my love. Soon after, I became her husband...and the mead hall's new chieftain. In truth, I had never been happier. But Svenja, my dear wife, existed in quiet misery, constantly haunted by the memory of the Uderfrykte, and the damage it had wrought on the mead hall, and the people she had loved. Night after night, my dear woke up screaming, her face etched in horror and a single word issuing from her lips -- \"Uderfrykte!\"\nI feared for my wife's sanity and happiness, but it was she who found a solution to her problem. As a warrior, she told me, she must confront her fear. She must defeat it. The Uderfrykte was dead, yes, but where did it come from? Was it unique? Would more of the creatures come, and wreak havoc once again? Would I, her loving husband, be killed? And so she corresponded with explorers and researchers all across Tamriel, until she found the answer she had been looking for. The Uderfrykte was in fact NOT unique, but the offspring of an ancient Uderfrykte Matron. In order to end the nightmares, in order to prevent any more destruction, we would need to hunt down and kill the Uderfrykte Matron, no matter where or how.\nEntry 2.\nBy &lt;a href=\"Ysmir\"&gt;Ysmir&lt;/a&gt;, we've been searching. And searching. And searching some more. But finally it came\u2014the lucky break we had been hoping for. The creature has been spotted by a shepherd in the remote highlands of &lt;a href=\"Skyrim\"&gt;Skyrim&lt;/a&gt;!\nEntry 3.\nWe found its trail and tracked it for days, crossing the border into the Imperial Province. Here in the frigid mountains, we met with a local hunter who tried to warn us away from the area, citing an old legend about a deadly creature known as the &lt;a href=\"The%20Horror%20of%20Dive%20Rock\"&gt;Horror&lt;/a&gt; of Dive Rock\u2014a monster credited with the slaying of over a dozen people, and just as much cattle. Could this creature be the very &lt;a href=\"Uderfrykte%20Matron\"&gt;Uderfrykte Matron&lt;/a&gt; we seek? Perhaps, unlike its child on Solstheim, the Matron moves from location to location, and its this mobility that has thus far prevented its killing or capture?\nEntry 4.\nwe have made camp at Dive Rock, reportedly the highest natural observation point in all of Cyrodiil. From here we can see for miles! So we'll keep watch, night and day. We're close, so very close. Svenja and I can feel it in our very bones. Indeed, Svenja has always been particularly in tune with such things, and is convinced the Uderfrykte Matron is close.\nEntry 5.\nSvenja has grown tired of my constant writing, but this journal will serve as a record of our travels and defeat against the &lt;a href=\"Uderfrykte\"&gt;Uderfrykte&lt;/a&gt;. She's staring at me angrily, impatiently, right now as I write, but this entry is too important\u2014finally, on this third day of watching, we've spotted it\u2014the Uderfrykte Matron! It is unlike anything we have ever lain eyes on, a giant, troll-like beast that seems to waver and shimmer in the cold\u2014like the feral form of winter itself! We're off now to trudge down the mountain, weapons in hand, and give the Horror of Dive Rock\u00a0its due!\nEntry 6.\nFailure and horror! We engaged the monster with all the force we could muster, but it was a travesty beyond comprehension. Svenja... My beautiful Svenja! My dear wife was killed instantly, consumed by the beast nearly whole! And though it shames me now to write these words, I could think of nothing more at the time than escape. I took flight, returning here to our camp on Dive Rock, to collect my thoughts and nerve.\nI haven't much time. After this quick entry I will march out and meet the Uderfrykte Matron once more\u2014it is sure to track me back to this campsite anyway, so our confrontation is inevitable. Can I even hope to defeat this monstrosity? One thing is certain\u2014Svenja and I came hastily, unprepared. My steel axe? Useless. My dear wife's &lt;a href=\"Frostwyrm\"&gt;Frostwyrm Bow&lt;/a&gt;? Completely ineffective (and swallowed whole, still in Svenja's hand...).\nThe beast appears to be a creature of the cold, and is likely nearly completely resistant to it. I would attack with fire if I had any on hand. But there is no time. No time to travel to a mages guild and procure an enchanted blade, or hire the services of a sorceror. My steel axe will have to do. And so I return to battle now, and hope beyond hope that I may slay the wretched monster that has brought so much grief to so many people. And if not, I take comfort in knowing I will soon rejoin my beautiful bride in the gilded halls of &lt;a href=\"Sovngarde%20%28Location%29\"&gt;Sovngarde&lt;/a&gt;.\nIf someone is reading this hastily written journal, I am likely dead, and pray to\n&lt;a href=\"Agnar%20the%20Unwavering\"&gt;Agnar the Unwavering&lt;/a&gt;,\nChieftain of &lt;a href=\"Thirsk\"&gt;Thirsk&lt;/a&gt;"}

His wife was &lt;a href=\"Svenja%20Snow-Song\"&gt;Svenja Snow-Song&lt;/a&gt;, also a Nord who survived the Thirsk &lt;a href=\"The%20Mead%20Hall%20Massacre\"&gt;Mead Hall Massacre&lt;/a&gt; where &lt;a href=\"the%20Udyrfrykte\"&gt;the Udyrfrykte&lt;/a&gt; went on a destructive rampage and killed all of the patrons of the Thirsk Mead Hall except for her. Agnar became the chieftain of Thirsk after the Slayer of the Udyrfrykte.\nDuring the &lt;a href=\"Oblivion%20Crisis\"&gt;Oblivion Crisis&lt;/a&gt;, Agnar, through the questioning of researchers and adventurers, discovered that the Udyrfrykte was not the only one of its kind, but was only the offspring of a far greater beast known as the &lt;a href=\"Uderfrykte%20Matron\"&gt;Uderfrykte Matron&lt;/a&gt;. As his wife Svenja was still haunted by dreams of the Udyrfrykte's attack on the Thirsk Mead Hall, Agnar became determined to search for and kill the Matron.\nJoined by his wife, Agnar set off to &lt;a href=\"Skyrim\"&gt;Skyrim&lt;/a&gt; to search for the beast. Finding the beast was far from easy, and Agnar searched for months without finding any trace of the Uderfrykte Matron. Eventually, however, a local shepherd in the highlands of Skyrim gave Agnar the news he had been waiting for. The Uderfrykte Matron had been sighted in &lt;a href=\"Cyrodiil\"&gt;Cyrodiil&lt;/a&gt;.\nDeath.\nAgnar and his wife followed the creature into Cyrodiil and tracked the beast through the &lt;a href=\"Jerall%20Mountains\"&gt;Jerall Mountains&lt;/a&gt;, north of &lt;a href=\"Bruma%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;Bruma&lt;/a&gt;. The two Nords set up camp at &lt;a href=\"Dive%20Rock\"&gt;Dive Rock&lt;/a&gt;, the highest natural observation point in all of Cyrodiil, where they waited to catch a sign of the Uderfrykte Matron.\nEventually, they found the beast and Agnar and Svenja attacked the Uderfrykte Matron. Unfortunately, this did not go well at all, their weapons proved ineffective and Svenja was swallowed whole. Agnar fled, but was set upon by the Uderfrykte Matron at his camp at Dive Rock while he was writing in his journal. Agnar was slain; however, his journal entry gave a later &lt;a href=\"Hero%20of%20Kvatch\"&gt;adventurer&lt;/a&gt; the necessary information to finally find and slay the beast."}

Falion can also be heard having a conversation with his adopted daughter, Agni, where she claims to have had \"bad dreams\" of him making monsters while she slept.\nConversations.\nFalion.\nFalion: \"Have you been working on your concentration?\"\nAgni: \"Yes sir, I have.\"\nFalion: \"Good, good. Concentration is paramount when dealing with magic forces.\"\nAgni: \"Why?\"\nFalion: \"Because an unfocused mind will almost certainly be obliterated. Destroyed by the forces you attempt to control and wield.\"\nAgni: \"Oh.\"\nFalion: \"Have no fear. I believe its within you to excel in your studies. But you must learn to concentrate!\"\nAgni: \"Yes, sir!\"\nAgni: \"When I grow up, will I go to the College in Winterhold?\"\nFalion: \"No, I don't think that will be necessary.\"\nAgni: \"But I'm learning about magic, and that's what they do there. Shouldn't I go?\"\nFalion: \"The College is not the only place to learn about magic.\"\nAgni: \"But you went there, didn't you? Isn't that where you learned?\"\nFalion: \"I was there only for a short time. Much of what I have learned has been on my own. And I will teach you. You have no reason to go there.\"\nAgni: \"But...\"\nFalion: \"That is enough.\"\nAgni: \"I had a bad dream again last night.\"\nFalion: \"Oh?\"\nAgni: \"I dreamt that you went away.

Think no more of it.\"\nAgni: \"Is it true that you kill deer and eat their hearts?\"\nFalion: \"What? Where did you hear such a thing?\"\nAgni: \"I don't know.

He will provide the key that his mother gave him, who told him it would help unlock the truth of his past.\nAt Crowhaven, the Hero finds a ruined fortress that looks long deserted. In the back is a locked door with Lord Lovidicus trapped behind it. After fighting Lovidicus it is discovered in his &lt;a href=\"Journal%20of%20the%20Lord%20Lovidicus\"&gt;journal&lt;/a&gt; that he was a &lt;a href=\"Vampire%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;vampire&lt;/a&gt; when he conceived his child, and when he told Agronak's mother she locked him in his chambers and fled to the &lt;a href=\"Imperial%20City%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;Imperial City&lt;/a&gt;.\nAfter learning the truth, Agronak becomes distraught to learn his father was a \"spawn of evil\" and feels like he himself carries the filth.\nIf the quest is completed before challenging him to become Grand Champion, he will stand there and let the Hero kill him, saying that he wants to die instead of living knowing that he \"is something filthy.\" The kill will count as murder. The &lt;a href=\"Dark%20Brotherhood%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;Dark Brotherhood&lt;/a&gt; will contact the Hero as a result, but there will not be a bounty on the Hero's head, nor will the guards pursue the Hero.\nDialogue.\n\"Yes, it's what everyone calls me. I guess I'm partly to blame. I've never made it a secret that I'm actually only half Orc. I am a Lord's son, yet I've been denied the noble privilege to which I am entitled. So I have become the Gray Prince, noble in my own right. Still... If I could prove who I really am, and show the world that an Orc can be noble in blood as well as deed... Maybe... Yes! You could help me!\""}

After finding Hlidara, she'll tell the Hero that she only takes the ring off when she is sleeping, and on the Ides of the month, the 14th through the 17th, she is not in the Castle.\nOptional: Return to Ahdarji at that point and tell her about how Amusei tried to sell the ring back to Alessia. This will cause her to double the reward money. Alternatively, tell Ahdarji about it with the ring in possession, just before returning the ring, to avoid running around needlessly.\nGo into the castle basement following the marker, and on the South wall of the basement, there is an open barrel with a lever. Pull it to reveal a hidden doorway that leads to Alessia's torture chamber. Keep going upstairs, and end up right next to her room.\nA guard patrols the hallway in front of her bedroom. At one point he leaves the room and when this happens it's a good idea to continue to her room. Keep following the marker, and go next to her bed where the Jewelry box is. Pick the Hard (Average for lower levels) lock and grab the ring. Make sure she is in bed and sleeping, otherwise it won't be there.\nAlternatively, the Hero may try and pickpocket her while she sleeps for the key, however, this may or may not work.\nTake the ring back to Ahdarji, and then go back to S'Krivva in &lt;a href=\"Bravil%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;Bravil&lt;/a&gt; to finish it up."}

After speaking with one of them, the Hero can, now, go to Sinnammi Mirpal.\nSinnammu Mirpal.\nSinnammi Mirpal, the Wise Woman and the tribe's leader, due to the lack of &lt;a href=\"Ashkhan\"&gt;Ashkhan&lt;/a&gt;, will send the Nerevarine on a quest to prove their claim, a task that requires the &lt;a href=\"Daedric%20Shrines%20%28Morrowind%29\"&gt;Daedric shrine&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"Ald%20Daedroth\"&gt;Ald Daedroth&lt;/a&gt; be made safe for the Ahemmusa Tribe, so they may take refuge within it.\nAld Daedroth.\nThe Nerevarine must go north, pass several islands, to reach the island upon which the shrine stands. At the shrine the Nerevarine encounters a skirmish between the order of the &lt;a href=\"Ordinator%20%28Morrowind%29\"&gt;Ordinators&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Sheogorath\"&gt;Sheogorath&lt;/a&gt; Cultists. There are four ways to proceed: Both sides in the battles can be joined, although, depending which group the Hero chooses to help, the other side's fighters will turn hostile. Or, the Nerevarine may defeat all the Ordinator and all the Cultists. And the last way, is to simply observe. To continue the quest, only the Cultists and the &lt;a href=\"Golden%20Saint%20%28Morrowind%29\"&gt;Golden Saints&lt;/a&gt; dwelling inside Ald Daedroth need to be defeated. The friendly &lt;a href=\"Scamp%20%28Morrowind%29\"&gt;Scamp&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Lustidrike\"&gt;Lustidrike&lt;/a&gt; and the Ordinators can remain.\nIf the Nerevarine speaks to an Ordinator, the only way to end the conversation peacefully, is to declare, that they are there to loot the shrine. The Nerevarine may also speak to the leader of the Cultists, &lt;a href=\"Hlireni%20Indavel\"&gt;Hlireni Indavel&lt;/a&gt;, within the Antechamber of the Shrine, whom will either duel the Nerevarine, or take pity on the Ahemmusa Tribe, which requires a &lt;a href=\"Speechcraft%20%28Morrowind%29\"&gt;Speechcraft&lt;/a&gt; skill above 50, or be threatened by the Nerevarine's reputation, which requires a reputation above 20.\nThe Nerevarine must, now, return to Sinnammi Mirpal in order to receive their next task.\nEscorting Sinnammu.\nThe next phase of the quest involves escorting Sinnammi Mirpal to Ald Daedroth in order to prove that the shrine is safe for the Ahemmusa to use it as refuge. Mirpal declares, that, should she die during the journey to the shrine, then, it is not safe for the Ahemmusa and the quest will fail. The Nerevarine must take great care of Mirpal during the journey to the shrine. Mirpal possesses the &lt;a href=\"Water%20Walking%20%28Morrowind%29\"&gt;Water Walking&lt;/a&gt; ability.\nOnce the Nerevarine and Mirpal have arrived at the Inner Shrine within the Daedric ruin, at the foot of the statue of &lt;a href=\"Sheogorath\"&gt;Sheogorath&lt;/a&gt;, Mirpal will declare the Nerevarine as the Ahemmusa Nerevarine and offers the &lt;a href=\"Madstone%20of%20the%20Ahemmusa\"&gt;Madstone of the Ahemmusa&lt;/a&gt; to show the Ahemmusa's support."}

Raise her disposition to 50 and she will be interested. Choose the \"smooth moves\" and \"her profession\" dialogue topics and then \"Give Ahnassi the gift of friendship\". She'll plead with the Nerevarine to come and visit her often. This opens up a string of quests with her.\nWalkthrough.\nAcquaintances.\nOnce the Nerevarine and Ahnassi are properly acquainted, she'll reveal that the guest &lt;a href=\"Hrordis\"&gt;Hrordis&lt;/a&gt;, upstairs, has a magic belt and worships &lt;a href=\"Mehrunes%20Dagon\"&gt;Mehrunes Dagon&lt;/a&gt;. However, Hrordis won't talk to the Nerevarine.\nGift.\nSpeaking to Ahnassi about the \"new friend\" topic will open up the \"share a gift\" option, which will allow her to give the Nerevarine a &lt;a href=\"Quality%20Potion%20of%20Feather\"&gt;Quality Potion of Feather&lt;/a&gt;.\nCammona Tong thugs.\nSelect the \"share a care\" topic with Ahnassi and she will tell of a Camonna Tong thug, Daren Adryn, who has frightened her by trying to force her to join the guild. Go and pay Daren a surprise visit in Nadene Rotheran's shack in Gnaar Mok. Talking to him about Ahnassi will only delay the inevitable fight with him and the other three Camonna Tong members in the shack. Return to Ahnassi and she will clear the Nerevarine's criminal record. She will also give some new gifts including an &lt;a href=\"Extravagant%20Shirt\"&gt;Extravagant Shirt&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Extravagant%20Pants\"&gt;Pants&lt;/a&gt; as well as the &lt;a href=\"Short%20Blade%20%28Morrowind%29\"&gt;Short Blade&lt;/a&gt; skill book \"&lt;a href=\"36%20Lessons%20of%20Vivec%2C%20Sermon%2030\"&gt;36 Lessons of Vivec, Sermon 30&lt;/a&gt;\".\nOnce Daren has been taken care of, Ahnassi will say that the &lt;a href=\"House%20Redoran%20%28Morrowind%29\"&gt;Redoran&lt;/a&gt; agent &lt;a href=\"Beldrose%20Dralor\"&gt;Beldrose Dralor&lt;/a&gt; has a key to two small chests in the Redoran Treasury in &lt;a href=\"Vivec%20City%20%28Morrowind%29\"&gt;Vivec City&lt;/a&gt;. The Dralor Manor is located in the &lt;a href=\"Vivec%2C%20Redoran%20Canton\"&gt;Vivec, Redoran Canton&lt;/a&gt; in Vivec and the key can be found in an unlocked chest in the top bedroom. The two chests are on a table in the treasury's lowest level, just watch out for the guards who will attack if they see the Nerevarine take anything. It is possible to unlock the lower Redoran Vault door using this key.\nSkooma addict.\nReturn and select the \"share a care\" dialogue topic. She will tell the Nerevarine about her former mate, J'Dhannar. J'Dhannar is a skooma addict who lives in the &lt;a href=\"Vivec%2C%20St.%20Olms%20Canton\"&gt;St. Olms Canton&lt;/a&gt; in Vivec and Ahnassi wants the Nerevarine to persuade him to quit the drug. He can be found on the lower level of St. Olms on the canalworks section and becomes quite irate when the Nerevarine tries to cure him. Speak with &lt;a href=\"Ladia%20Flarugrius\"&gt;Ladia Flarugrius&lt;/a&gt; upstairs in the Half-Way Tavern, who will suggest the book \"&lt;a href=\"Confessions%20of%20a%20Dunmer%20Skooma%20Eater\"&gt;Confessions of a Skooma-Eater&lt;/a&gt;\", at &lt;a href=\"Jobasha%27s%20Rare%20Books\"&gt;Jobasha's Rare Books&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;a href=\"Vivec%2C%20Foreign%20Quarter\"&gt;Foreign Quarter&lt;/a&gt; where it is for sale at 25 . Alternately, you can speak to &lt;a href=\"Crazy-Legs%20Arantamo\"&gt;Crazy-Legs Arantamo&lt;/a&gt; in the Foreign Quarter. Another copy of the book is sold by &lt;a href=\"Codus%20Callonus\"&gt;Codus Callonus&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Ald%27ruhn%20%28Morrowind%29\"&gt;Ald'ruhn&lt;/a&gt;. Return to J'Dhannar with the book and, with a disposition of 50, he can be cured with success.\nOnce this is done, return to Ahnassi and hear that J'Dhannar has indeed quit the skooma and has returned home to &lt;a href=\"Elsweyr\"&gt;Elsweyr&lt;/a&gt;. Ahnassi now considers the Nerevarine her \"very special friend\" and invites the Nerevarine to visit her home in town, and gives him a key. Her house can be used by the Nerevarine for housing and storage. Ahnassi will now be found in her house from this point on.\nSenyndie.\nOnce the Nerevarine and Ahnassi move in together, the Nerevarine has the chance to meet with Ahnassi's friend, Senyndie, at the &lt;a href=\"Vivec%2C%20Arena%20Canton\"&gt;Arena Canton&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Vivec%20City%20%28Morrowind%29\"&gt;Vivec City&lt;/a&gt;. Mention Ahnassi to Senyndie her disposition will become maximum, and she will give a free copy of \"&lt;a href=\"The%20Black%20Arrow%2C%20Book%20I\"&gt;The Black Arrow, Book I&lt;/a&gt;\". Senyndie is also the master trainer for &lt;a href=\"Acrobatics%20%28Morrowind%29\"&gt;Acrobatics&lt;/a&gt; in the game and will provide a discount on training.\nFlowers.\nSpeak with Ahnassi again using the \"share a gift\" topic to learn that she wants two flowers, a Coda Flower and a Gold Kanet. Look at the crossroads west of Pelagiad for a large amount of Gold Kanet. The coda is more difficult to find, and is actually the flower of the &lt;a href=\"Draggle%20Tail\"&gt;Draggle Tail&lt;/a&gt; plants found along the &lt;a href=\"Bitter%20Coast%20%28Morrowind%29\"&gt;Bitter Coast&lt;/a&gt; region. The best place to find them is between &lt;a href=\"Seyda%20Neen%20%28Morrowind%29\"&gt;Seyda Neen&lt;/a&gt; and the stronghold of &lt;a href=\"Hlormaren%20%28Morrowind%29\"&gt;Hlormaren&lt;/a&gt; far to the northwest. A Coda can also be bought from &lt;a href=\"Peragon\"&gt;Peragon&lt;/a&gt; at &lt;a href=\"Moonmoth%20Legion%20Fort\"&gt;Moonmoth Legion Fort&lt;/a&gt;. Return the flowers to Ahnassi.\nRobe.\nOnce the Nerevarine gives her the flowers, Ahnassi will ask the Nerevarine to steal a Flamemirror Robe from the wizard &lt;a href=\"Mavon%20Drenim\"&gt;Mavon Drenim&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;a href=\"Vivec%2C%20Telvanni%20Canton\"&gt;Telvanni Canton&lt;/a&gt;. Drenim is a powerful opponent. Either face the wizard and kill him if possible, or take the stealthy approach and take the robe from the closet. Return it to Ahnassi for 20 &lt;a href=\"Ebony%20Throwing%20Star\"&gt;Ebony Throwing Star&lt;/a&gt;s.\nBlindfold.\nThe last quest from Ahnassi, revealed again by her \"share a gift\" topic, will task the Nerevarine with retrieving Elvul's Black Blindfold from the &lt;a href=\"Imperial%20Commission\"&gt;Imperial Commission&lt;/a&gt; in Ebonheart. Ahnassi will mention that it is well guarded and that there is a secret entrance located underwater just outside of Ebonheart.\nIf her advice is taken, the Nerevarine will be attacked in the secret entrance by &lt;a href=\"Furius%20Acilius\"&gt;Furius Acilius&lt;/a&gt;. He is a tougher than average fight though, and wears one of the best cuirasses in the game (the &lt;a href=\"Lord%27s%20Mail%20%28Armor%29\"&gt;Lord's Mail&lt;/a&gt;). After progressing through the passages, the Nerevarine will need to get by two locked doors which are level 95, which can be tricky with a low security skill, although the &lt;a href=\"Worn%20Imperial%20Key\"&gt;Worn Imperial Key&lt;/a&gt; found in one of the crates in the passage will open one of them. The alternative route is simply to enter the Imperial Commission through the front door.\nThe Blindfold, which is actually a glove, is behind the level 50 locked door. The key can also pickpocketed from &lt;a href=\"Rufinus%20Alleius\"&gt;Rufinus Alleius&lt;/a&gt;. Grab the glove from the chest of drawers, and then return to Ahnassi."}

To protect herself from Ahnurr, Fadomai gave her child &lt;a href=\"Ja-Kha%27jay\"&gt;Ja-Kha'jay&lt;/a&gt; the Lunar Lattice, so that Ahnurr could not cross. \nEventually, &lt;a href=\"Y%27ffer\"&gt;Y'ffer&lt;/a&gt; would blurt out the secrets of how to cross the Lattice for all to hear, but &lt;a href=\"Azurah\"&gt;Azurah&lt;/a&gt; closed the ears of Ahnurr so that he could not hear it.\nInteraction with other deities.\nIn some myths, Ahnurr's favored son was Akha the First Cat. Ahnurr encouraged Akha to find love the way he himself had found it with Fadomai. Akha mated with a lot of different mates before going south and disappearing, with Alkosh appearing in his place. In other myths, however, Alkosh takes Akha's role as the First Cat and Akha doesn't appear at all.\nAhnurr was less kind to some of his other children. Over time, he banished both &lt;a href=\"Boethra\"&gt;Boethra&lt;/a&gt; and Merrunz, the former for her rebellious nature, the latter for his tendency towards being wild and destructive."}

This chain begins with &lt;a href=\"Pixies\"&gt;Pixies&lt;/a&gt; (Whilloki) at one end, followed by &lt;a href=\"Mer\"&gt;elves&lt;/a&gt;, then nephrine, with &lt;a href=\"Men\"&gt;human&lt;/a&gt; and semi-human beings in the middle, and the godlike beings such as &lt;a href=\"Gheateus\"&gt;Gheateus&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Chonus\"&gt;Chonus&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Sygria\"&gt;Sygria&lt;/a&gt; at the other end. This hierarchical chain is not an order of command, since the plans and schemes of Faerie are governed simply by their own whim.\nHis book, \"The Faerie Chain\", was published in &lt;a href=\"Firsthold\"&gt;Firsthold&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"2E%20456\"&gt;2E 456&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe Faerie Chain theory was new and completely original, however it proved controversial since it placed elves only slightly above pixies. Ahrtabazus was challenged on his assumptions based on very slight coincidences, although with modification, his Faerie Chain theory has gained wider acceptance since its publication. However, most faerie scholars agree that because the theory is based on coincidental evidence and supported by auxiliary theories, it may very well be wrong."}

According to legends, he was the first great Nord enchanter and, possibly, the first human to master elven methods of arcane magic. Along with &lt;a href=\"Zahkriisos\"&gt;Zahkriisos&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Dukaan\"&gt;Dukaan&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Vahlok\"&gt;Vahlok&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Miraak\"&gt;Miraak&lt;/a&gt;, he is one of the five such priests found on &lt;a href=\"Solstheim%20%28Dragonborn%29\"&gt;Solstheim&lt;/a&gt;.\nHistory.\nThe man that would become Ahzidal grew up in the first Nordic city of &lt;a href=\"Saarthal\"&gt;Saarthal&lt;/a&gt; during the late &lt;a href=\"Merethic%20Era\"&gt;Merethic Era&lt;/a&gt;. As a child, his aptitude for &lt;a href=\"magic\"&gt;magic&lt;/a&gt; was evident to his tutors. When he reached adulthood, he surpassed all of them. With nothing further to learn in Saarthal, he left his wife and child to train under the elven masters.\nHe returned to Saarthal several years later, only to find his hometown had been &lt;a href=\"Night%20of%20Tears\"&gt;sacked&lt;/a&gt; by the native &lt;a href=\"Snow%20Elf\"&gt;Snow Elves&lt;/a&gt; who had lived in peace with his kind for many years. In his rage and grief, he took for himself the name of Ahzidal, meaning \"embittered destroyer,\" and swore to exact vengeance against the &lt;a href=\"Mer\"&gt;Mer&lt;/a&gt;. Although he would come to fulfill his promise of revenge, it cost him his sanity.\nYears passed, and Ahzidal would travel the lands and study ever deeper into the arcane arts. From the &lt;a href=\"Dwemer\"&gt;Dwemer&lt;/a&gt;, he learned the seven natures of metal and how to harmonize them. From the &lt;a href=\"Ayleid\"&gt;Ayleid&lt;/a&gt;s, he collected knowledge of the ancient runes and dawn-magic. He sought out knowledge from the Snow Elves, &lt;a href=\"Chimer\"&gt;Chimer&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Altmer\"&gt;Altmer&lt;/a&gt;, hoarding what he could from each, all the while plotting how he might turn that knowledge against them.\nWhen Ahzidal learned that &lt;a href=\"Ysgramor\"&gt;Ysgramor&lt;/a&gt;\u00a0had &lt;a href=\"The%20Return\"&gt;returned&lt;/a&gt; with a war band of the greatest warriors and hunters of &lt;a href=\"Atmora\"&gt;Atmora&lt;/a&gt; to reclaim Saarthal, he immediately sought them out and offered all of his knowledge to the &lt;a href=\"Five%20Hundred%20Companions\"&gt;Five Hundred Companions&lt;/a&gt;. Imbued with the magical enchantments that Ahzidal bestowed upon them, Ysgramor's elites utterly decimated the Snow Elves occupying Saarthal, and would eventually end the dominion of Mer over &lt;a href=\"Skyrim\"&gt;Skyrim&lt;/a&gt;.\nDespite his promise of revenge being fulfilled, Ahzidal became corrupted in his lust for vengeance and power, causing him to eventually fall to madness through his obsessions. Not satisfied merely with the knowledge of either Men or Mer, he next sought out the secrets of the &lt;a href=\"Dragon%20Language\"&gt;dragon-runes&lt;/a&gt;, which led him into the order of &lt;a href=\"Dragon%20Priests%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Dragon Priests&lt;/a&gt;. However, even that failed to suffice in his hunger and Ahzidal later turned his focus on the &lt;a href=\"planes%20of%20Oblivion\"&gt;planes of Oblivion&lt;/a&gt;, at which point he subsequently came under the thrall of the &lt;a href=\"Daedric%20Prince\"&gt;Daedric Prince&lt;/a&gt; of Knowledge and Fate, &lt;a href=\"Hermaeus%20Mora\"&gt;Hermaeus Mora&lt;/a&gt;.\nAhzidal finally lost himself, falling prey to his own pursuit of perfection. He fled to &lt;a href=\"Solstheim%20%28Dragonborn%29\"&gt;Solstheim&lt;/a&gt;, only to be sealed away by the &lt;a href=\"Dragon%20Cult\"&gt;Dragon Cult&lt;/a&gt; within the depths of &lt;a href=\"Kolbjorn%20Barrow%20%28Dragonborn%29\"&gt;Kolbjorn Barrow&lt;/a&gt; together with the last of &lt;a href=\"Ahzidal%27s%20Armor\"&gt;his relics&lt;/a&gt;, becoming forgotten by history.\nInteractions.\n&lt;a href=\"Unearthed%20%28Dragonborn%29\"&gt;Unearthed&lt;/a&gt;.\nAhzidal is encountered in Kolbjorn Barrow during the quest \"Unearthed.\" From his tomb, he corrupted the mind of &lt;a href=\"Ralis%20Sedarys\"&gt;Ralis Sedarys&lt;/a&gt; and influenced him to excavate his crypt and release him from his entombment.\nCombat.\nAhzidal\u00a0is a &lt;a href=\"Fire%20Damage%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;fire&lt;/a&gt;-based Dragon Priest, and the mask he wears augments his destructive fire magic considerably. To aid himself in combat, he can reanimate the dead bodies scattered throughout the room. &lt;a href=\"Draugr%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Draugr&lt;/a&gt; of various levels will join the fray as well.\nAhzidal's signature spell &lt;a href=\"Fire%20Stream\"&gt;Fire Stream&lt;/a&gt; deals enormous damage, has a cast time of zero and travels like a bolt of lightning rather than a traditional fireball projectile. This makes it extremely difficult to avoid the attack. To defeat Ahzidal, it is highly recommended to have very high Fire resistance, magic absorption or both to be able to tank his spells.\nSneak-focused archers should have no problem defeating him by shooting him repeatedly while hiding, as the pillars in the room provide ample cover."}

As a boy, his gift for &lt;a href=\"magic\"&gt;magic&lt;/a&gt; and artifice had been evident to his tutors. As a man, his skill surpassed them all. And finding nothing more to learn among his kin, he left wife and child, and set out to train under the &lt;a href=\"Mer\"&gt;elven&lt;/a&gt; masters. A year became two, then three. And when finally his path led him back to Saarthal, he found only ruins: for the elves had sacked the city, and all that lived there were dead and gone. Amid the ashes, in the smoldering ruins of his home, he swore a terrible oath of vengeance. And from that comes the name the legends gave him: &lt;a href=\"Ahzidal\"&gt;Ahzidal&lt;/a&gt;, the embittered destroyer.\nAlone he could do nothing. And so he bided his time, delving deeper into his art than any before him. From the &lt;a href=\"Dwemer\"&gt;Dwemer&lt;/a&gt;, he learned the seven natures of metal and how to harmonize them. From the &lt;a href=\"Ayleid\"&gt;Ayleid&lt;/a&gt;s, the ancient runes and dawn-magic even the elves had begun to forget. Among &lt;a href=\"Falmer%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Falmer&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Chimer\"&gt;Chimer&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Altmer\"&gt;Altmer&lt;/a&gt; he traveled, taking what he could from each, and all the while plotting how he might turn that knowledge against them.\nFinally, word reached him of &lt;a href=\"Ysgramor\"&gt;Ysgramor&lt;/a&gt; and his &lt;a href=\"Five%20Hundred%20Companions\"&gt;Companions&lt;/a&gt;, newly-arrived from &lt;a href=\"Atmora\"&gt;Atmora&lt;/a&gt;. For three days and nights, he rode north, and met them as they made landfall on the icy coast near the ruins of Saarthal, which the elves had fortified against them. He offered the Companions his service, and all he had produced in his years of labor. And with Atmoran steel imbued with his enchantments, the elves fell before them, and at last he had his revenge.\nBut he was not content. His craft had become his life, and his hunger for knowledge still gnawed at him, driving him to delve ever deeper. At long last, he exhausted the lore of the elves, but it was not enough. He sought the secrets of &lt;a href=\"Dragon%20Language\"&gt;Dragon-runes&lt;/a&gt;, and won for himself a seat among their high priests, but it was not enough. And at length, he turned his gaze to the planes of &lt;a href=\"Oblivion%20%28Realm%29\"&gt;Oblivion&lt;/a&gt;, and found there both power and madness.\nSome say he ventured there, never to return. Others, that he was betrayed by his fellow &lt;a href=\"Dragon%20Priests%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Dragon Priests&lt;/a&gt;, and killed, or driven into hiding in the ruins beneath his beloved Saarthal.

But like all things Khajiiti, as the expression goes, \"gzalzi vaberzarita maaszi\", or \"absurdity has become necessity.\" Much of what I have to say has probably never been written before, and if it has, no one has read it. The &lt;a href=\"Imperials\"&gt;Imperials&lt;/a&gt; feel that everything must be written down for posterity, but every Khajiiti kitten born in &lt;a href=\"Elsweyr\"&gt;Elsweyr&lt;/a&gt; knows his history, he drinks it in with his mother's milk.\nFairly recently, however, our struggles to win back our homeland from the rapacious Count of &lt;a href=\"Leyawiin\"&gt;Leyawiin&lt;/a&gt; have attracted sympathetic persons, even Imperials, who wish to join our cause, but, it seems, do not understand our ways. Our enemies, of course, do not understand us either, but that is as we wish it, a &lt;a href=\"weapon\"&gt;weapon&lt;/a&gt; in our arsenal. Our non-Khajiiti friends, however, should know who we are, why we are, and what we are doing.\nThe Khajiit mind is not engineered for self-reflection. We simply do what we do, and let the world be damned. To put into words and rationalize our philosophy is foreign, and I cannot guarantee that even after reading this, you will understand us. Grasp this simple truth -- \"q'zi no vano thzina ualizz\" -- \"When I contradict myself, I am telling the truth.\"\nWe are the Renrijra Krin. \"The Mercenary's Grin\u00b8\" \"The Laugh of the Landless,\" and \"The Smiling Scum\" would all be fair translations. It is a derogatory expression, but it is amusing so we have adopted it.\nWe have anger in our hearts, but not on our faces. We fight for Elsweyr, but we do not ally ourselves with the Mane, who symbolizes our land. We believe in justice, but do not follow laws.\n\"Q'zi no vano thzina ualizz.\"\nThese are not rules, for there is no word for \"rules\" in Ta'agra. Call them our \"thjizzrini\" -- \"foolish concepts.\"\n1. \"Vaba Do'Shurh'do\": \"It Is Good To Be Brave\"\nWe are struggling against impossible odds, against the very &lt;a href=\"Septim%20Empire\"&gt;Empire&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"Tamriel\"&gt;Tamriel&lt;/a&gt;. Our cause is the noblest cause of all: defense of home. If we fail, we betray our past and our future. Our dead are \"Ri'sallidad\", which may be interpreted as \"martyrs\" in the truest, best sense of that word which is so often misused. We honor their sacrifice and, beneath our smiles, mourn them deeply.\nOur bravery most obviously shows in the smile that is the \"Krin\" part of our name. This does not mean that we walk about grinning like the idiotic baboonish &lt;a href=\"Imga\"&gt;Imga&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"Valenwood\"&gt;Valenwood&lt;/a&gt;. We simply are entertained by adversary. We find an equal, fair fight tiresome in the extreme. We confidently smile because we know our victory in the end is assured. And we know our smiles drive our enemies insane.\n2. \"Vaba Maaszi Lhajiito\": \"It Is Necessary To Run Away\"\nWe are struggling against impossible odds, against the very Empire of Tamriel. Honor is madness. Yes, we loved the Renrijra Krin who died in brave battle against the forces of the Empire, but I guarantee you that each of those Ri'sallidad had an escape route he or she failed to use, and died saying, \"Damn.\"\nWhen the great &lt;a href=\"Senche-Raht\"&gt;Senche-Raht&lt;/a&gt; comes to the Saimisil Steppes, he will find himself unable to hunt, unable to sleep, as the tiny &lt;a href=\"Alfiq\"&gt;Alfiq&lt;/a&gt; leap onto his back, biting him, and running off before he has a chance to turn his great body to face them. Eventually, though he may stubbornly hope to catch the Alfiq, the Senche-Raht always leaves. They are our cousins, the Alfiq, and we have adopted their strategy against the great tiger of Leyawiin.\nDo not ally yourself with the Renrij if you yearn to be part of a mighty army, marching resolutely forth, for whom retreat is anathema. We will laugh at your suicidal idiocy as we slip into the reeds of the river, and watch the inevitable slaughter.\n3. \"Fusozay Var Var\": \"Enjoy Life\"\nLife is short. If you have not made love recently, please, put down this book, and take care of that with all haste. Find a wanton lass or a frisky lad, or several, in &lt;a href=\"LGBTQ%2B\"&gt;whatever combination&lt;/a&gt; your wise loins direct, and do not under any circumstances play hard to get. Our struggle against the colossal forces of oppression can wait.\nGood. Welcome back.\nWe Renrijra Krin live and fight together, and know that Leyawiin and the Empire will not give way very soon, likely not in our lifetimes. In the time we have, we do not want our closest comrades to be dour, dull, colorless, sober, and virginal. If we did, we would have joined the &lt;a href=\"Emperor\"&gt;Emperor&lt;/a&gt;'s &lt;a href=\"Blades\"&gt;Blades&lt;/a&gt;.\nDo not begrudge us our lewd jokes, our bawdy, drunken nights, our &lt;a href=\"moonsugar\"&gt;moonsugar&lt;/a&gt;. They are the pleasures that Leyawiin denies us, and so we take our good humor very seriously.\n4. \"Fusozay Var Dar\": \"Kill Without Qualm\"\nLife is short. Very short, as many have learned when they have crossed the Renrijra Krin.\nWe fight dirty. If an enemy is facing us, we might consider our options, and even slip away if his sword looks too big. If his back is to us, however, I personally favor knocking him down, and then jumping on his neck where the bones snap with a gratifying crunch. Of course, it is up to you and your personal style.\n5. \"Ahzirr Durrarriss\": \"We Give Freely To The People\"\nLet us not forget our purpose. We are fighting for our families, the Khajiiti driven from the rich, fertile shores of Lake Makapi and the River Malapi, where they and their ancestors lived since time immemorial. It is our battle, but their tragedy. We must show them, lest they are swayed by other rhetoric, that we are fighting for them.\n&lt;a href=\"The%20Mane\"&gt;The Mane&lt;/a&gt;, The Emperor, and The &lt;a href=\"Count\"&gt;Count&lt;/a&gt; can give &lt;a href=\"speech\"&gt;speech&lt;/a&gt;es, pass laws, and, living life in the open, explain their positions and philosophies to their people to stave off the inevitable revolution. Extralegal entities, such as the Renrijra Krin, must make our actions count for our words. This means more than fighting the good fight, and having a laugh at our befuddled adversaries. It means engaging and seducing the people. Ours is not a military war, it is a political war. If the people rise up against our oppressors, they will retreat, and we will win.\nGive to these people, whenever possible, &lt;a href=\"Septim%20%28Coin%29\"&gt;gold&lt;/a&gt;, moonsugar, and our strong arms, and though they hide, their hearts will be with us.\n6. \"Ahzirr Traajijazeri\": \"We Justly Take By Force\"\nLet us not forget our purpose. We are thieves and thugs, smugglers and saboteurs. If we cannot take a farm, we burn it to the ground. If the Imperials garrisoned in a glorious ancient stronghold, beloved by our ancestors, will not yield, we tear the structure apart. If the only way to rescue the land from the Leyawiin misappropriation is to make it uninhabitable by all, so be it.\nWe want our life and our home back as it was twenty years ago, but if that is not realistic, then we will accept a different simple, pragmatic goal. \"Revenge. With a smile.\""}

He confronted this stranger, demanding to know his business here.\nThe intruder stared at him rudely and didn't deign to answer. He strode from the village and vanished beyond the hills to the east. Etiache wanted to follow him, but Ovidius forbade it, worried that only trouble would result.If only we had listened to &lt;a href=\"Etiache\"&gt;Etiache&lt;/a&gt;. We should have caught and killed that stranger. Perhaps what befell us would have been avoided. &lt;a href=\"Auri-El\"&gt;Auri-El&lt;/a&gt; knows; I do not.\nA few days later, another stranger came to Hackdirt, wearing well-used swords loose in their scabbards. His steed was wild-eyed, a warhorse bred for combat, held in check only by the rider's stern hand. Up to &lt;a href=\"Ovidius\"&gt;Ovidius&lt;/a&gt; this warrior rode.\nHe named himself &lt;a href=\"Vanier\"&gt;Vanier&lt;/a&gt; and proclaimed himself the new overlord of Hackdirt. He said his gang, the &lt;a href=\"Black%20Daggers\"&gt;Black Daggers&lt;/a&gt;, waited just over the hill. He gave us one day to agree to his terms or all would be slaughtered. All inhabitants were now his servants and our dwellings, livestock, and all possessions were now his. Those who cooperated would find him a just overlord, he claimed.\nOvidius stared, mouth agape. Before he could gather his wits, matters were taken from his hands. &lt;a href=\"Nerva\"&gt;Nerva&lt;/a&gt; charged Vanier, screaming that he would never live as a slave. The bandit's sword sheared off the tines of Nerva's pitchfork and the horse's hooves lashed out and crushed his head. We stood there stunned as Vanier rode off.\nWe buried Nerva behind his house that evening. Then we gathered around the well and discussed our fate. Some, like &lt;a href=\"Yggoz\"&gt;Yggoz&lt;/a&gt; and Etiache, urged that we stay and fight. As if farmers and merchants had a chance against such as Vanier. Saner heads prevailed and we voted to abandon Hackdirt. Even Yggoz agreed in the end.\nOnly Ovidius opposed the will of the rest, saying he would never leave Hackdirt. No argument could prevail against him. In the end, he ascended the tower with all the food and water we could spare. We sealed the door shut behind him.\nIt was &lt;a href=\"Iirenir\"&gt;Iirenir&lt;/a&gt;, quiet, shy Iirenir, who suggested we chain shut our doors and destroy all we could not carry. This was done with a sense of grim satisfaction.\nDawn will break soon. The others have gone, moving slowly to the south. I must leave too. I linger only to finish this. Perhaps someday we will reclaim Hackdirt and this journal will survive as a record of our darkest times."}

All the joints move, just not on their own. Uncle said the spider needed a 'control crystal' with the right 'electroharmonic signature'. The Guards are out looking for one now.\nSpider Centurion Research, Week 2\nAfter yesterday's incident, I assembled a staff to hold the crystal. It actually works! When you use the staff, it creates a beacon of some kind, and the spider just walks on over to it. Better yet, it doesn't attack everyone on sight now!\nSpider Centurion Research, Week 3\nApparently it will still attack, just not on sight. During this morning's experiment, one of the newer guards was startled and drew his sword, and he was dead before anyone could react. Did it actually detect hostile intent?\nSpider Centurion Research, Week 4\nFurther testing confirms that the spider seems to detect the intent of its controller in some way. Last week, it tried to defend me from a threat. This week, I snapped at a guard who interrupted my latest test, and it lashed out at him. Fascinating!\nSpider Centurion Research, Week 5\nNo one appreciates my work. Uncle Calcelmo is buried in his &lt;a href=\"Falmer%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Falmer&lt;/a&gt; research, and doesn't have time to help me with the spider anymore. The guards are all afraid of it. I keep telling them it's harmless as long as I keep it under control, but there have been too many accidents. They just don't believe me. I wanted to show the Jarl, but I can't seem to get the spider to leave the lab- it looks like its control crystal only works up here. Maybe if I can reattune the enchantment...?"}

Beauchamp's airship seems sturdy enough, and the crew is ready to set sail. We'll travel north-northwest until we reach the island of Solstheim. According to Beauchamp, the Hrothmund's Bane wolf formation is somewhere near the &lt;a href=\"Moesring%20Mountains\"&gt;Moesring Mountains&lt;/a&gt;. The barrow we're set to explore is located at the wolf's eye. We'll get Beauchamp's precious magic item and be back at the &lt;a href=\"Mages%20Guild\"&gt;Guild of Mages&lt;/a&gt; in a few days. What could possibly go wrong?\nEntry 4: Damn conjurers, sorcerers, inventors, scientists and all they're academic ilk! Beauchamp promised me his airship would hold together, promised me it could be sailed just like a sea-bound craft. All lies! This monstrosity is barely holding together\u2014we've been trailing bits and pieces of it ever since we left &lt;a href=\"Ald%27ruhn%20%28Morrowind%29\"&gt;Ald'Ruhn&lt;/a&gt;! Just an hour ago we lost one of the &lt;a href=\"Dwemer\"&gt;Dwemer&lt;/a&gt; cogs from the main engine! If this were a frigate or sloop I'd be holding her together just fine, but alas, trying to control an airship is like setting to sea in a barrel with a spoon for an oar.\nEntry 6: Land ho!\nEntry 7: It's normal for a crewmember to get edgy, but the &lt;a href=\"Argonian\"&gt;Argonian&lt;/a&gt; finally went berserk. I told him repeatedly before we left Ald'Ruhn that an airship sails in the sky, and not on the water. He told me he understood, but his fear of heights must have finally taken sway. In a frenzied state he grabbed the wheel and almost forced us into the sea. I had no choice but to run him through. &lt;a href=\"Swims-In-Swells\"&gt;Swims-In-Swells&lt;/a&gt; was his name, and a good crewmember he was before this unfortunate incident. I would have preferred a burial at sea, but considering our current situation we had no choice but to toss his body overboard. We aimed for the ocean, but by that time the airship had drifted over Solstheim. Alas, I fear we missed, and his corpse landed somewhere on the southeastern shore.\nEntry 9: We've located Hrothmund's Bane! At least Beauchamp was right about something. The wolf formation runs from west to east, with the head\u2014and eye\u2014toward the eastern end. We'll look for a place to set down and then explore Hrothmund's Barrow\u2014assuming THAT is where Beauchamp said it would be. I must also note that the going is slower than I'd like. There's a fell chill in the air, and I don't trust the dark clouds that have gathered over the mountains...\nEntry 11: We have been assailed by a blizzard, the likes of which I have never seen! I feared a storm, but could never have imagined anything like this. Beauchamp's contraption is coming apart at the seams, and I don't think we can hold altitude. There's nowhere to land, but land we must!\nEntry 12: Dead. All of them dead. Most of the crew were killd instantly when the aiship went down. the few that made it soon sucummed to the cold. I alon survived. Need to make a camp. Snow is blocking my way into the ship's hold. I go to the barrow in the murning. I can harly write. My hands arr nearly frzen.\nEntry 13: so cold so cold.

In the ensuing fight, Richton is killed and the airship is completely destroyed.\nNym's Airship.\nAn airship was known to exist in , piloted by Captain Nym and used to collect \"Star Teeth.\" The airship crashed into the Glacier Crawl and the stranded crew eventually died. All of the Star Teeth it collected were looted by Ice Warriors (possibly &lt;a href=\"Falmer\"&gt;Falmer&lt;/a&gt;).\nThrassian Airships.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Sload\"&gt;Sload&lt;/a&gt; are also said to operate airships, most notably for carrying corpses to use in &lt;a href=\"Necromancy\"&gt;Necromancy&lt;/a&gt;.

Gold Kanet and Stoneflower Petals makes a paste that &lt;a href=\"Restore%20Strength%20%28Morrowind%29\"&gt;restores strength&lt;/a&gt;. The paste has some bad effects, but they last only short time.\nStoneflowers are dark blue and the flowers are very heavy so they bend to the ground. It is very expensive, but Ajira can gain &lt;a href=\"Fortify%20Magicka%20%28Morrowind%29\"&gt;more magicka&lt;/a&gt; for a short time by mixing Stoneflower petals with crushed &lt;a href=\"Emerald%20%28Morrowind%29\"&gt;emeralds&lt;/a&gt; and water.\nWillow flowers are red and very tall with tall and thin leaves also. Willow very good for potions and has many uses. With &lt;a href=\"Frost%20Salts%20%28Morrowind%29\"&gt;frost salts&lt;/a&gt;, Ajira made a &lt;a href=\"Frost%20Shield%20%28Morrowind%29\"&gt;shield of frost&lt;/a&gt;. With &lt;a href=\"grave%20dust\"&gt;grave dust&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Green%20Lichen\"&gt;green lichens&lt;/a&gt;, Ajira made a potion to &lt;a href=\"Potion%20of%20Cure%20Common%20Disease\"&gt;cure common diseases&lt;/a&gt;. And with &lt;a href=\"Corkbulb%20Root\"&gt;Corkbulb&lt;/a&gt; Ajira made a potion that can &lt;a href=\"Potion%20of%20Cure%20Paralyzation\"&gt;cure paralyzation&lt;/a&gt;.\nAjira thinks Heather comes from &lt;a href=\"Skyrim\"&gt;Skyrim&lt;/a&gt; because the leaves look like the spiny leaves of trees in Skyrim. The flowers are also pink like the &lt;a href=\"Nords%20%28Morrowind%29\"&gt;Nord&lt;/a&gt; people. When mixed with &lt;a href=\"Ruby%20%28Morrowind%29\"&gt;ruby&lt;/a&gt;, it makes very good potion to make you &lt;a href=\"Feather%20%28Morrowind%29\"&gt;not weigh&lt;/a&gt; so much. With a scrap of &lt;a href=\"Scamp%20Skin%20%28Morrowind%29\"&gt;Scamp skin&lt;/a&gt;, Ajira made a potion to &lt;a href=\"Restore%20Personality%20%28Morrowind%29\"&gt;restore personality&lt;/a&gt;.\nAjira works very hard to collect these flower samples from the dangerous Lake Amaya.

All Russula has strong odors, but Luminous Russula much stronger. Russula can be poison if not prepared right. When mixed with &lt;a href=\"Pearl%20%28Morrowind%29\"&gt;pearl dust&lt;/a&gt; it makes very good potion to &lt;a href=\"Water%20Breathing%20%28Morrowind%29\"&gt;breathe under the water&lt;/a&gt;.\n&lt;a href=\"Violet%20Coprinus%20%28Morrowind%29\"&gt;Violet Coprinus&lt;/a&gt; is a tall toadstool that glows in the night. Coprinus also is poison if mixed wrongly like if you mix with Russula. Coprinus mixed with&lt;a href=\"scales%20%28Morrowind%29\"&gt;scales&lt;/a&gt; lets Ajira &lt;a href=\"Water%20Walking%20%28Morrowind%29\"&gt;walk on the water&lt;/a&gt; instead of under the water. Much better.\n&lt;a href=\"Bungler%27s%20Bane%20%28Morrowind%29\"&gt;Bungler's Bane&lt;/a&gt; looks like a brown shelf and grows from trees and sometimes wet rocks. Bungler's Bane very bad for you when mixed with almost anything. Very hard to use, but Ajira found Bungler's Bane and left over crushed pearl makes good &lt;a href=\"Potion%20of%20Dispel\"&gt;Potion of Dispel&lt;/a&gt;. No bad effects with Ajira's skill, but potion tastes very bad.\n&lt;a href=\"Hypha%20Facia\"&gt;Hypha Facia&lt;/a&gt; looks just like Bungler's Bane. Confuses Ajira very easily, but Bungler's Bane smells more dry and dusty. Hypha Facia has little smell, but taste is very moist. Hypha Facia very good mushroom for eating, but too much makes Ajira clumsy. Ajira used Hypha Facia to make the &lt;a href=\"Nix-Hound%20Meat\"&gt;nix hound meat&lt;/a&gt; more edible, and Ajira could smell all enchantments in Ajira's room. Ajira found no other use for Hypha Facia.\nAjira works very hard to go all over Bitter Coast and collect all these mushrooms. Ajira deserves rank of Journeyman much sooner than &lt;a href=\"Galbedir\"&gt;Galbedir&lt;/a&gt;."}

They are known as Dragon Breaks because Akatosh, who is symbolised as a Dragon, is the god of Time and thus a break in the timeline can be viewed as breaking the Dragon, so to speak.\nOnly three Dragon Breaks have been recorded and verified historically, as\u2014due to their very nature\u2014the majority of people would be unaware of their occurrence. The first of these is referred to as the &lt;a href=\"Middle%20Dawn\"&gt;Middle Dawn&lt;/a&gt;, and occurred when the &lt;a href=\"Marukhati%20Selective\"&gt;Marukhati Selective&lt;/a&gt;s \"danced on the tower.\" This was done to remove the merish aspects of Akatosh, which the Selectives found offensive. It lasted for either 150 or 1,008 years.\nThe second recorded Dragon Break was the so-called &lt;a href=\"Warp%20in%20the%20West\"&gt;Warp in the West&lt;/a&gt; (or the \"Miracle of Peace\"), which was brought on by the building of &lt;a href=\"Numidium\"&gt;Numidium&lt;/a&gt; in ; however, it is speculated that Akatosh, Mara, and &lt;a href=\"Stendarr\"&gt;Stendarr&lt;/a&gt; were responsible for this event.\nAmulet of Kings.\nThe artifact known as the &lt;a href=\"Amulet%20of%20Kings\"&gt;Amulet of Kings&lt;/a&gt; was created by Akatosh. As lord of the &lt;a href=\"Aedra\"&gt;Aedra&lt;/a&gt;, Akatosh took pity on the plight of Men, who were slaves of the &lt;a href=\"Ayleid\"&gt;Ayleid&lt;/a&gt;s, and drawing precious blood from his own heart, blessed &lt;a href=\"Alessia\"&gt;Alessia&lt;/a&gt; with the blood of &lt;a href=\"Dragons%20%28Lore%29\"&gt;dragons&lt;/a&gt;.\u00a0He also made a &lt;a href=\"Covenant\"&gt;Covenant&lt;/a&gt; that so long as Alessia's generations were true to the dragon blood, Akatosh would endeavor to seal tight the &lt;a href=\"Oblivion%20Gate%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;Oblivion Gate&lt;/a&gt; for good\u00a0and deny the armies of &lt;a href=\"Daedra\"&gt;Daedra&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"undead\"&gt;undead&lt;/a&gt; to their enemies, the Ayleids. Akatosh then gave Alessia the Amulet of Kings and the Eternal &lt;a href=\"Dragonfires\"&gt;Dragonfires&lt;/a&gt;, which, when lighted, would restrict the Daedra to the realms of &lt;a href=\"Oblivion%20%28Realm%29\"&gt;Oblivion&lt;/a&gt;. The Amulet contains a gem of Alessia herself, and eight other gems, one for each of the &lt;a href=\"Eight%20Divines\"&gt;Eight Divines&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe \"&lt;a href=\"Remanada\"&gt;Remanada&lt;/a&gt;\" mentions the amulet and how it was a symbol of the &lt;a href=\"Reman%20Dynasty\"&gt;Reman Dynasty&lt;/a&gt;\u00a0and\u00a0how it was lost during the &lt;a href=\"Interregnum\"&gt;Interregnum&lt;/a&gt;\u00a0before being rediscovered by &lt;a href=\"Tiber%20Septim\"&gt;Tiber Septim&lt;/a&gt;.\nAvatar of Akatosh.\nDuring the &lt;a href=\"Oblivion%20Crisis\"&gt;Oblivion Crisis&lt;/a&gt;, the Avatar of Akatosh was summoned after the &lt;a href=\"Hero%20of%20Kvatch\"&gt;Hero of Kvatch&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Martin%20Septim\"&gt;Martin Septim&lt;/a&gt; failed to light the &lt;a href=\"Dragonfires\"&gt;Dragonfires&lt;/a&gt; in time before &lt;a href=\"Mehrunes%20Dagon\"&gt;Mehrunes Dagon&lt;/a&gt; arrived on &lt;a href=\"Nirn\"&gt;Nirn&lt;/a&gt;. Martin sacrificed himself and the &lt;a href=\"Amulet%20of%20Kings\"&gt;Amulet of Kings&lt;/a&gt; to summon the Avatar of Akatosh. The Avatar fought Mehrunes Dagon in the ruins of the &lt;a href=\"Temple%20of%20the%20One\"&gt;Temple of the One&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;a href=\"Imperial%20City\"&gt;Imperial City&lt;/a&gt;, and after defeating the Prince of Destruction, turned to stone, becoming a reminder of what happened there.\nIt is unknown if the statue of the Avatar remained standing after the &lt;a href=\"Great%20War\"&gt;Great War&lt;/a&gt; when the Imperial City was invaded and occupied by the &lt;a href=\"Third%20Aldmeri%20Dominion\"&gt;Third Aldmeri Dominion&lt;/a&gt; during the &lt;a href=\"Fourth%20Era\"&gt;Fourth Era&lt;/a&gt;."}

{"id": "1484", "revid": "17401442", "url": "https://elderscrolls.fandom.com/wiki?curid=1484", "title": "Akavir", "text": "Akavir (&lt;a href=\"Aldmeri%20Language\"&gt;Aldmeris&lt;/a&gt;/&lt;a href=\"Ehlnofex\"&gt;Ehlnofex&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Tsaesci\"&gt;Tsaesci&lt;/a&gt;: \"Dragon Land\") is a continent lying to the east of &lt;a href=\"Tamriel\"&gt;Tamriel&lt;/a&gt;, separated by the &lt;a href=\"Padomaic%20Ocean\"&gt;Padomaic Ocean&lt;/a&gt;. It is the homeland of four seemingly unrelated races collectively referred to as the \"&lt;a href=\"Akaviri\"&gt;Akaviri&lt;/a&gt;.\" These races are composed of the &lt;a href=\"Kamal\"&gt;Demons of Kamal&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"Tsaesci\"&gt;serpent-men of Tsaesci&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"Tang%20Mo\"&gt;Monkey People of Tang Mo&lt;/a&gt;, and the &lt;a href=\"Ka%20Po%27%20Tun\"&gt;Tiger Dragons of Ka'Po'Tun&lt;/a&gt;. Some sources talk of other races, which have not been seen since and may be extinct.\nLittle else is known about the continent or the people of Akavir, as very few Tamrielic peoples have crossed the vast ocean that separated it from their home. It was believed that humans lived in Akavir at one time but were eventually \"eaten\" by the Tsaesci, who have themselves launched several attacks upon Tamriel in past ages. The latest contact with Akavir was supposedly attempted by the &lt;a href=\"Nerevarine\"&gt;Nerevarine&lt;/a&gt;, who was said to have launched a trip to Akavir after defeating &lt;a href=\"Dagoth%20Ur%20%28Character%29\"&gt;Dagoth Ur&lt;/a&gt;.\nHistory.\nThe history of Akavir mostly involves legends and tales of battles between armies of Akavir and &lt;a href=\"Tamriel\"&gt;Tamriel&lt;/a&gt;. A mythical story states that a great &lt;a href=\"Lyrisius\"&gt;hero&lt;/a&gt; once rode on the back of a dragon, forcing it to slay an army of Akaviri slave traders.\nThe first specific encounter and written record occurred in 1E 2703. Tamriel was invaded by the Tsaesci, but the invasion was halted by &lt;a href=\"Reman%20I\"&gt;Reman I&lt;/a&gt; and his armies. The Akaviri forces surrendered to the Emperor after discovering that he was the fabled &lt;a href=\"Dragonborn%20%28Lore%29\"&gt;Dragonborn&lt;/a&gt;, and were offered amnesty to fight for the Empire.The Akaviri who accepted these terms later played important roles in Tamriel's growing society.\nThe second Akaviri invasion of Tamriel took place in the year &lt;a href=\"2E%20572\"&gt;2E 572&lt;/a&gt;. Unlike the first invasion, this invasion was undertaken primarily by the &lt;a href=\"Kamal\"&gt;Kamal&lt;/a&gt;i snow-demons of Akavir, led by their king &lt;a href=\"Ada%27Soom%20Dir-Kamal\"&gt;Ada'Soom Dir-Kamal&lt;/a&gt;. The Kamal led a huge naval assault which landed just by the &lt;a href=\"White%20River\"&gt;White River&lt;/a&gt;. The city of &lt;a href=\"Windhelm\"&gt;Windhelm&lt;/a&gt; quickly fell to the invaders, but they were fought off as a result of the formation of the &lt;a href=\"Ebonheart%20Pact\"&gt;Ebonheart Pact&lt;/a&gt;.\nIn &lt;a href=\"3E%20268\"&gt;3E 268&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Uriel%20V\"&gt;Uriel V&lt;/a&gt; took the throne of the Empire. He led a series of invasions leading up to an assault upon Akavir. The invasion on Akavir failed, and Uriel V died in the Battle at &lt;a href=\"Ionith\"&gt;Ionith&lt;/a&gt;. The lands of the Tsaesci were the main targets of the invasion, and at first the invasion went well, with two cities falling without resistance to the Imperial Legions in the expeditionary force. However, several natural factors and use of powerful magicka by the Tsaesci led to the severe weakening of the force, allowing the Tsaesci to besiege and rout it. Rumored &lt;a href=\"magicka\"&gt;magicka&lt;/a&gt; attacks were weather control and interference with &lt;a href=\"Battlemage\"&gt;Battlemage&lt;/a&gt; magicka communication. Although many men were saved by the navy, at least one whole legion was destroyed (four were taken), and many of the ocean-going ships that transported the invasion were damaged and/or destroyed.\nCulture.\nDemography.\nTang Mo.\n&lt;a href=\"Tang%20Mo\"&gt;Tang Mo&lt;/a&gt; is home to a race of monkey-folk (not to be confused with the monkey-folk known as the &lt;a href=\"Imga\"&gt;Imga&lt;/a&gt;) who are being oppressed on a constant basis by the three other races of Akavir. The other nations of Akavir have all tried to invade Tang Mo at one point in time, and the monkey-folk hold a special hatred of the snake people of Tsaesci. However, the monkey-folk have since allied with the tiger people of Ka Po Tun.\nKamal.\n&lt;a href=\"Kamal\"&gt;Kamal&lt;/a&gt; is inhabited by primal demons that thaw out once a year and attack Tang Mo, but the monkey-folk always manage to drive them back. A demon warlord, &lt;a href=\"Ada%27Soom%20Dir-Kamal\"&gt;Ada'Soom Dir-Kamal&lt;/a&gt;, once attempted to conquer &lt;a href=\"Morrowind\"&gt;Morrowind&lt;/a&gt; but was destroyed at &lt;a href=\"Red%20Mountain\"&gt;Red Mountain&lt;/a&gt; by &lt;a href=\"Almalexia\"&gt;Almalexia&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Underking\"&gt;Underking&lt;/a&gt;. It was during this invasion that &lt;a href=\"Vivec\"&gt;Vivec&lt;/a&gt; is said to have flooded the island of Vvardenfell and taught the entire Dunmer race to breathe water. This is the only known encounter with an Akaviri race besides the Tsaesci.\nKa'Po'Tun.\nFormerly Po Tun, \"Tiger Empire\", &lt;a href=\"Ka%20Po%27%20Tun\"&gt;Ka Po' Tun&lt;/a&gt; is the homeland of the tiger people. After the serpent-men ate all the men of Akavir, they also attempted to eat all the dragons. The red dragons were enslaved, but the black dragons fled to what was then known as Po Tun. A great war on Akavir followed, leaving all remaining dragons dead and both serpent and tiger peoples weak. The tiger people have since attempted to become dragons. Their leader, &lt;a href=\"Tosh%20Raka\"&gt;Tosh Raka&lt;/a&gt;, has already accomplished this and is the largest dragon in the world. Most recent reports have stated that the Po Tun have formed an alliance with their simian-like neighbors the Tang Mo. Their plans are for the annihilation or complete rule and enslavement of the Tsaesci. Scholars expect that this new alliance and their potential success may either cause these two powers to turn on each other, work towards commerce and better foreign relations, or worse: a whole new invasion against Tamriel.\nTsaesci.\n&lt;a href=\"Tsaesci\"&gt;Tsaesci&lt;/a&gt; is the largest, and presumably the most powerful, of the kingdoms on Akavir. It was the first region on Akavir to attempt a Tamrielic invasion, with moderate success. According to legend, Tsaesci is the homeland of immortal vampiric serpent-men. The men that used to exist in Akavir were all eaten by this race. The Tsaesci also &lt;a href=\"Slavery\"&gt;enslaved&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"goblin\"&gt;goblin&lt;/a&gt;s that they used for labor and blood.\nPerhaps the most well-known Tsaesci from this region was Potentate &lt;a href=\"Versidue%20Shaie\"&gt;Versidue Shaie&lt;/a&gt;, who ruled the &lt;a href=\"Empire\"&gt;Cyrodilic Empire&lt;/a&gt; after the death of King Reman III. His bloodline ruled for four hundred years, before being assassinated by the &lt;a href=\"Morag%20Tong\"&gt;Morag Tong&lt;/a&gt;.\nHumans.\nIt is unknown what happened to the humans of Akavir. One source says they were \"eaten\" by the Tsaesci. However, there is very little explanation on the meaning of \"eat\" in that context, and there are conflicting accounts of the Akaviri; the depiction of the Tsaesci in multiple sources indicates that they are literally serpentine. But other sources, such as the \"&lt;a href=\"Akaviri%20Diary%20Translation\"&gt;Akaviri Diary Translation&lt;/a&gt;\", imply that there were humanoid people with the &lt;a href=\"Tsaesci\"&gt;Tsaesci&lt;/a&gt;, this may mean that the humans of Akavir are still alive.\nGoblins.\nGoblins were also reported to be present on Akavir, living in the surrounding isles of the continent. However, it is unknown if they shared any relation to Tamrielic Goblins or if they are in fact a disparate species. Many were enslaved by the Tsaesci and used as slaves and as a source of blood.\nOthers.\nEarly encounters between Tamriel and Akavir reported the presence of other unknown &lt;a href=\"beastfolk\"&gt;beastfolk&lt;/a&gt;, with references to crews of pirates with rat- and canine-like features. Little is known about such other races, including whether they still exist."}

They spoke a language known as Akaviri. There are several conflicting and contradictory reports about the Men of Akavir, including that they died out long ago, that they were eaten by the &lt;a href=\"Tsaesci\"&gt;Tsaesci&lt;/a&gt;, or that they are in fact the Tsaesci themselves.\nAnthropology.\nIt is not known exactly where the Men of Akavir came from, but some say they may share a common ancestor with the settlers of Tamriel (&lt;a href=\"Atmora\"&gt;Atmora&lt;/a&gt;). Wherever they may have come from, they have long since died out as of the present, as they were eaten long ago by the Tsaesci; though the word \"eaten\" may not refer to literal ingestion. Certain sources seem to imply that humans, or humanoid beings, were actually just assimilated into the Tsaesci Empire. The &lt;a href=\"Blades\"&gt;Blades&lt;/a&gt; seem to hold a very small resemblance to Akavir culture. The Blades, which were thought as the bodyguards of the &lt;a href=\"Emperor\"&gt;Emperor&lt;/a&gt;, originated as Akaviri crusaders who invaded Tamriel for obscure reasons in the late &lt;a href=\"First%20Era\"&gt;First Era&lt;/a&gt;. They appear to have been searching for a &lt;a href=\"Dragonborn%20%28Lore%29\"&gt;Dragonborn&lt;/a&gt;\u2014the events at &lt;a href=\"Pale%20Pass\"&gt;Pale Pass&lt;/a&gt; bear this out\u2014and the Akaviri were the first to proclaim &lt;a href=\"Reman%20Cyrodiil\"&gt;Reman Cyrodiil&lt;/a&gt; as Dragonborn. In fact, it was the Akaviri who did the most to promote his standing as Emperor (although Reman himself never took that title in his lifetime). There is no known hereditary connection between &lt;a href=\"Tiber%20Septim\"&gt;Tiber Septim&lt;/a&gt; and any of the previous Dragonborn rulers of Tamriel.\nPhysiology.\nThe Akaviri are believed to have been much like other human races in terms of physiology and appearance. It is believed that they looked similar to the other races of &lt;a href=\"men\"&gt;men&lt;/a&gt;. In fact, Imperials with Akaviri ancestry are virtually indistinguishable from pure-blooded Imperials.\nCulture.\nNot much is known about the culture of the Men of Akavir. &lt;a href=\"Cloud%20Ruler%20Temple\"&gt;Cloud Ruler Temple&lt;/a&gt;, in &lt;a href=\"Cyrodiil\"&gt;Cyrodiil&lt;/a&gt;, is based on Akaviri design, as well as the armor and weapons of The Blades. The Akaviri also seemed to have used &lt;a href=\"katana\"&gt;katana&lt;/a&gt;s, something not seen by any other race.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Proving%20Festival\"&gt;Proving Festival&lt;/a&gt; is a tradition of the Akaviri practiced in honor of their ancestors. It is a way for the dead to view the world of the living and provide judgments to their descendants. The tradition was continued by the Akaviri that arrived at &lt;a href=\"Tamriel\"&gt;Tamriel&lt;/a&gt; during the First Era.\nHistory.\nLittle to nothing has been preserved of the culture of the Men of Akavir. The Red Dragon, the symbol of the &lt;a href=\"Septim%20Empire\"&gt;Septim Empire&lt;/a&gt;, came from the Akaviri. During the invasion of &lt;a href=\"Tamriel\"&gt;Tamriel&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"1E%202703\"&gt;1E 2703&lt;/a&gt;, the Akaviri built &lt;a href=\"Sky%20Haven%20Temple\"&gt;Sky Haven Temple&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Skyrim\"&gt;Skyrim&lt;/a&gt; as an outpost for their &lt;a href=\"Dragonguard\"&gt;Dragonguard&lt;/a&gt;.The Akaviri eventually left their adopted home of Cyrodiil and moved to the Rim territories of Elsweyr, including the city of &lt;a href=\"Rimmen\"&gt;Rimmen&lt;/a&gt; after being made scapegoats for the Potentates. Those who didn't survive the flight from Cyrodiil were buried in the Tomb of the Serpents while many others went and founded the town of Hakoshae and others stayed in Rimmen and built the Tonenaka."}

It has been several days since I have seen anyone else on the road from our garrison at &lt;a href=\"Grey%20Ridge\"&gt;Grey Ridge&lt;/a&gt;. The road is lonely and treacherous. I am rationing my supplies to prepare for a tough path ahead. As long as &lt;a href=\"Reman%20Cyrodiil\"&gt;Reman Cyrodiil&lt;/a&gt;'s army hasn't located our headquarters at &lt;a href=\"Pale%20Pass\"&gt;Pale Pass&lt;/a&gt;, the journey should be fairly uneventful. I admit, I am nervous. It is an honor to be selected to carry these orders to our fort, but sending me alone is a calculated risk. While it is not my own life I am worried about, it is the importance of the contents of the orders that aggrieves me. If they are somehow lost, the fort will not know that their supplies are going to be delayed by a month. Without that knowledge, the fort may choose to press the attacks on the front line as their supplies dwindle. They are counting on those supplies to be there sooner. I must not fail getting this message there. The slate rock that the orders have been carved upon for safety weighs me down; it is a constant reminder of the more than physical burden that I carry.\"\nDay Seven\n\"It has been two days, and I have finally arrived at &lt;a href=\"Dragonclaw%20Rock\"&gt;Dragonclaw Rock&lt;/a&gt;. The huge formation is a welcome and invigorating sight. The giant stone appears to reach down from the north and strike at the heart of Remus' forces like our armies have been doing for the better part of a year now. I have still encountered no one else on this trail. I hope that as I head due west along the narrow path, I will find someone who can give me some news as to how our men are faring in the war.\"\nDay Eight\n\"After winding my way westward, I have come within sight of &lt;a href=\"The%20Sentinel\"&gt;The Sentinel&lt;/a&gt;: a huge statue placed there by some unknown artist many years ago. It stands watch pointing north, as if daring anyone to cross the borders into the &lt;a href=\"Imperial\"&gt;Imperial&lt;/a&gt; nation. Remus would be quite angry if he knew we used this very statue as a waypoint into his domain. Last night, I encountered another one of our messengers who had been beset by a pack of mountain &lt;a href=\"wolves\"&gt;wolves&lt;/a&gt;. His leg was hurt badly, but I managed to help heal it with an ampoule of medicine I carried with me. He said his name was &lt;a href=\"Sylaj\"&gt;Sylaj&lt;/a&gt;, and he was on his way from Pale Pass to request more supplies. I discussed with him the irony of our meeting, and he decided to travel with me back to the fort since his mission would be needless. We plan to leave at nightfall.\"\nDay Nine\n\"I am using much of my remaining strength writing this. As we had made our way north from The Sentinel, we were attacked by perhaps the same pack of wolves that had attacked Sylaj. He had chased them off earlier after being bitten, but now that they had tasted blood, they had returned in greater number. Fighting back to back, Sylaj and I slew at least 8 of the beasts, but not before one of them clawed my gut and left a terrible wound. We were able to drive them off, but now I am bleeding badly, and the only medicine I had I gave to Sylaj. We have decided to continue north until we reach the portal to the &lt;a href=\"Serpent%27s%20Trail\"&gt;Serpent's Trail&lt;/a&gt; and seek cover inside. I will try to write more soon, but I must sleep. I am so very tired.\"\nDay Eleven\n\"This is the last entry I shall be able to write. We entered the Serpent's Trail nearly a day ago, seeking shelter from the elements and the wolves. What we did not foresee was the creatures that had decided to make the Serpent's Trail their home. I did not see them clearly, but they were huge and strong. Sylaj died instantly as one of them cleaved off his head with a single stroke. There were three of these huge, ugly man-like creatures. I ran as fast as I dared through the dark tunnels trying to escape. But as I fled, one of them hurled a boulder at me and struck me square in the back. I managed to crawl through a smaller opening and escape the lumbering monsters, but I soon realized that crawling is all I would be able to do. I think the boulder shattered my spine. I can no longer feel my legs. My wound from the wolf attack has reopened and I have lost much blood. I fear that this is as far as I shall be able to go. I have failed my mission. I have been unable to get these orders to the fort at Pale Pass. I am so close, yet it may as well be leagues away since I can no longer walk and my strength is draining. If a fellow messenger or soldier picks up this diary, please get the orders to the fort before it is too late. And please tell my wife, Vata, that Xhaferi will always love her.\""}

{"id": "11056", "revid": "32911304", "url": "https://elderscrolls.fandom.com/wiki?curid=11056", "title": "Akaviri Invasions", "text": "The Akaviri Invasions are a series of attempted full-scale invasions of &lt;a href=\"Tamriel\"&gt;Tamriel&lt;/a&gt; by various peoples from the continent of &lt;a href=\"Akavir\"&gt;Akavir&lt;/a&gt;. While some make the claim that there have been at least three or more like incursions by the people of Akavir, most seem to agree that there have been two particularly widespread assaults upon the Tamrielic mainland. Not included amongst these invasions is &lt;a href=\"Uriel%20Septim%20V\"&gt;Uriel Septim V&lt;/a&gt;'s failed conquest of the Akaviri homeland in the year &lt;a href=\"3E%20290\"&gt;3E 290&lt;/a&gt;.\nIt cannot be said with certainty whether the invasions were due to a specific interest in Tamriel, or were simply the result of Imperial ambitions amongst the Akaviri. There are some who theorize the invasions may have something to do with Tamriel's anticipated role in the coming \"Last War.\" Allegedly, the God and ruler of the &lt;a href=\"Ka%20Po%27%20Tun\"&gt;Ka Po' Tun&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Tosh%20Raka\"&gt;Tosh Raka&lt;/a&gt;, has vowed to invade Tamriel as well after he has vanquished the &lt;a href=\"Tsaesci\"&gt;Tsaesci&lt;/a&gt; Kingdom.\nThe First Invasion.\nThe first, and perhaps most devastating, of the Akaviri Invasions occurred in the year &lt;a href=\"1E%202703\"&gt;1E 2703&lt;/a&gt; and played a large role in the foundation of the &lt;a href=\"Reman%20Empire\"&gt;Reman Empire&lt;/a&gt;. Referred to as the Akaviri Troubles, this invasion was carried out almost exclusively by the &lt;a href=\"Tsaesci\"&gt;Tsaesci&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe Akaviri made their first appearances in Tamriel as early as &lt;a href=\"1E%20800\"&gt;1E 800&lt;/a&gt;, with reports of ships manned by bizarre beasts, pirating and raiding islands in and around the &lt;a href=\"Iliac%20Bay\"&gt;Iliac Bay&lt;/a&gt; region. As it is understood, these raids played an important role in the coming invasion, scouting out the land for possible future incursions.\nThe Tsaesci invasion was seemingly preceded by a severe increase in Akaviri piracy, with the people of &lt;a href=\"Wayrest\"&gt;Wayrest&lt;/a&gt; forced to take refuge behind the city walls in &lt;a href=\"1E%202702\"&gt;1E 2702&lt;/a&gt; due to the presence of a large Akaviri raiding party. The following year, the main Akaviri force landed in northern &lt;a href=\"Skyrim\"&gt;Skyrim&lt;/a&gt;, and quickly cut through the armies of the &lt;a href=\"Nords\"&gt;Nords&lt;/a&gt;, spreading their invasion to every region of the north. While the Akaviri continued their conquest relatively unchallenged, in &lt;a href=\"Cyrodiil\"&gt;Cyrodiil&lt;/a&gt; the ambitious &lt;a href=\"Colovian\"&gt;Colovian&lt;/a&gt; General, &lt;a href=\"Reman\"&gt;Reman&lt;/a&gt;, had managed to rally the armies of Colovia and Nibenay under his banner for the purpose of defending Tamriel from the Akaviri threat. Reman used his forces to engage the Akaviri in northern Tamriel, constructing an expansive network of fortifications throughout Skyrim. Joining Reman's coalition were the forces of &lt;a href=\"Morrowind\"&gt;Morrowind&lt;/a&gt;, whose lands were also under direct threat from the Akaviri horde. Likewise, the &lt;a href=\"Kingdom%20of%20Daggerfall\"&gt;Kingdom of Daggerfall&lt;/a&gt; played a very important role in the defense of &lt;a href=\"High%20Rock\"&gt;High Rock&lt;/a&gt;.\nReman's war culminated at the &lt;a href=\"Battle%20of%20Pale%20Pass\"&gt;Battle of Pale Pass&lt;/a&gt;, where the Akaviri invaders would finally be defeated. Prior to the battle, Reman was aware that the Akaviri army was preparing to cross the &lt;a href=\"Jerall%20Mountains\"&gt;Jeralls&lt;/a&gt; into Cyrodiil. It was rumored that the Akaviri command was held up in a hidden outpost within the Pale Pass, which Reman intended to cut off from the army. Unbeknownst to Reman, a large avalanche had trapped the Akaviri commanders within the fort, leaving the main force isolated within the pass and without leadership. As Reman prepared his assault, so too did &lt;a href=\"Vivec\"&gt;Vivec&lt;/a&gt;, one of the &lt;a href=\"Tribunal\"&gt;God-Kings&lt;/a&gt; of Morrowind, move in with his army, cutting the Akaviri off from the north. After a brief battle the Akaviri army surrendered before Reman en masse. As legend holds it, the Akaviri horde, upon hearing Reman's voice, fell to their knees and swore their lives to him, proclaiming him &lt;a href=\"Dragonborn%20%28Lore%29\"&gt;Dragonborn&lt;/a&gt;, the chosen one after whom they had sought. Impressed by their weaponry and prowess in battle, Reman was more than happy to accept the Akaviri into his ranks. The Akaviri would become the nucleus of Reman's army, and as a whole would contribute heavily to the rise of &lt;a href=\"Reman%20Dynasty\"&gt;Reman Dynasty&lt;/a&gt;.\nIn &lt;a href=\"Breton\"&gt;Breton&lt;/a&gt; legend, the hero Lyrisius, an esteemed champion of &lt;a href=\"Boethiah\"&gt;Boethiah&lt;/a&gt;, is often pointed to as having destroyed the Akaviri Horde in High Rock with the help of a dragon. The authenticity of this legend, however, is questionable.\nThe Second Invasion.\nThe Second Akaviri Invasion occurred abruptly in the year &lt;a href=\"2E%20572\"&gt;2E 572&lt;/a&gt;. This invasion was undertaken primarily by the &lt;a href=\"Kamal\"&gt;Kamal&lt;/a&gt;i demons of Akavir, and led by their king &lt;a href=\"Ada%27Soom%20Dir-Kamal\"&gt;Ada'Soom Dir-Kamal&lt;/a&gt;. Some accounts bring the implication there may have been a contingent of Tsaesci present as well.\nWhile the course the invasion followed is relatively well-known, albeit slightly confused, the circumstances leading up to the attack are not so clear. All that is known is that on the 7th of Sun's Height, 2E 572, a fleet of Akaviri ships was sighted entering the mouth of the &lt;a href=\"White%20River\"&gt;White River&lt;/a&gt;, dropping anchor off the coast. There they sat for nearly a month before assaulting the beaches of &lt;a href=\"Windhelm\"&gt;Windhelm&lt;/a&gt; on the 2nd of Last Seed. For unknown reasons, the Akaviri had bypassed the &lt;a href=\"Telvanni%20Isles\"&gt;Telvanni Isles&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Vvardenfell\"&gt;Vvardenfell&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Solstheim\"&gt;Solstheim&lt;/a&gt; before finally reaching their objective. Reports of Akaviri movements through &lt;a href=\"Morrowind\"&gt;Morrowind&lt;/a&gt; place the first landings as early as the 29th of Sun's Height. The invasion itself came as a complete surprise, with Windhelm falling only after five days of siege. The city itself was brutally sacked, with the assault resulting in the deaths of the reigning Queen in East-&lt;a href=\"Skyrim\"&gt;Skyrim&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Mabjaarn%20Flame-Hair\"&gt;Mabjaarn Flame-Hair&lt;/a&gt;, and her heir &lt;a href=\"Nurnhilde\"&gt;Nurnhilde&lt;/a&gt;.\nIt is at this point that details on the invasion become slightly obscured, especially those surrounding the actions of the immediate heir and acting King, &lt;a href=\"Jorunn\"&gt;Jorunn&lt;/a&gt;. According to some sources, Jorunn was in Windhelm when the invasion began but managed to flee the city, heading south to &lt;a href=\"Riften\"&gt;Riften&lt;/a&gt;. Others state that Jorunn had already been in Riften when the fighting started. It has also been said that upon hearing of the invasion, Jorunn heroically came to the aid of Windhelm with his &lt;a href=\"Pack%20of%20Bards\"&gt;Pack of Bards&lt;/a&gt;, arriving just in time to see the city gates breached, and was unable to save the city. Contrary to this claim, others sources state that Jorunn, rather than attack, remained in Riften while Windhelm was under siege, buying the time to rally his forces and fortify the city.\nWhen regarding certain aspects of the Second Akaviri Invasion, it becomes hard to discern the facts from myth. Regardless, most sources agree that, at some point, Jorunn found his forces accompanied by someone claiming to be the legendary &lt;a href=\"Underking\"&gt;Underking&lt;/a&gt;. As it is told, Jorunn, in despair after having barely escaping Windhelm's destruction, retreated to &lt;a href=\"High%20Hrothgar\"&gt;High Hrothgar&lt;/a&gt; to plead the &lt;a href=\"Greybeards\"&gt;Greybeards&lt;/a&gt; for aid in defeating the Akaviri. The Greybeards responded by singing the ghost of the great &lt;a href=\"Ysmir%20Kingmaker\"&gt;Ysmir Kingmaker&lt;/a&gt; back into the world. Jorunn, now apparently referred to as the \"Skald-King,\" with the help of the Underking, mustered a great army of Nords ready to destroy the invading Akaviri horde. However, other legends state that the Underking instead walked &lt;a href=\"Nirn\"&gt;Nirn&lt;/a&gt; at the summoning of the &lt;a href=\"Dunmer\"&gt;Dunmer&lt;/a&gt; living-god, &lt;a href=\"Almalexia\"&gt;Almalexia&lt;/a&gt;, with the two vanquishing Ada'Soom at &lt;a href=\"Red%20Mountain\"&gt;Red Mountain&lt;/a&gt;.\nWith Windhelm in ruins, Ada'Soom Dir-Kamal moved his forces south into &lt;a href=\"The%20Rift\"&gt;The Rift&lt;/a&gt;. However, instead of laying siege to Riften, as King Jorunn anticipated, he bypassed the city and began marching towards Morrowind, breaking through the defenses at &lt;a href=\"Fort%20Virak\"&gt;Fort Virak&lt;/a&gt;. Why Ada'Soom made this decision is not known, though some theorize that he may have been deterred by Riften's impressive fortifications, or that he believed the Nords would not follow him outside Skyrim. What is clear is that Ada'Soom intended to march on &lt;a href=\"Mournhold\"&gt;Mournhold&lt;/a&gt;, with Jorunn leaving their defensive posturing to pursue him. The forces of Morrowind, led by Almalexia and her general &lt;a href=\"Tanval%20Indoril\"&gt;Tanval Indoril&lt;/a&gt;, were unable to holdout against the Akaviri assault. Rather than continue fighting the Akaviri outright, the Dunmeri command instead ordered a fighting retreat through the Ashlands, in order to regroup at the defensive line in &lt;a href=\"Stonefalls\"&gt;Stonefalls&lt;/a&gt;. As the Akaviri hit the Dunmer at Stonefalls, not far outside the city of &lt;a href=\"Ebonheart\"&gt;Ebonheart&lt;/a&gt;, the Nords swooped in with an attack on their rear line, in a surprise attack so well executed it has been theorized that there must have been some early coordination between the Nord and Dunmer forces. However, Jorunn's army was weak and demoralized, suffering from their long trek through foreign territory. Had it not been for the Underking's inspirational leadership, the attack may have failed. Though the Akaviri were outmaneuvered and hard-pressed, they still managed to hold against the onslaught, repeatedly pushing back the advancing Nordic and Dunmeri forces. The Akaviri's intent was to holdout on the beaches until their fleet arrived in which they would make a quick retreat. The outcome of the battle hung in the balance, with the Akaviri fleet on the horizon. But as it seemed the Akaviri forces were about to escape, the surprise intervention of two legions of &lt;a href=\"Argonian\"&gt;Argonian&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Shellbacks\"&gt;Shellbacks&lt;/a&gt;, provided the extra push to break the Akaviri lines. At first, the Dunmeri forces dreaded the sight of the oncoming Argonians, perceiving them as a slave-revolt looking to take advantage of Morrowind's present vulnerability. Some rumors even tell of Dunmer soldiers turning their blades against the Argonians, unwilling to accept the help of the slave-race. Nevertheless, the Akaviri were broken, and their panicked forces either fell from the sword or drowned in the &lt;a href=\"Inner%20Sea\"&gt;Inner Sea&lt;/a&gt;. Legends state the sea was risen by Vivec to destroy all that remained of the Akaviri. After the battle, it was decided that a defensive alliance must be formed between each of the armies in order to prevent another such invasion. In exchange for continued military aid, the Argonian slaves were granted temporary amnesty within the boundaries of the new founded &lt;a href=\"Ebonheart%20Pact\"&gt;Ebonheart Pact&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe reason Ada'Soom Dir-Kamal invaded Tamriel is still not fully known. Some reports from the few Akaviri soldiers captured during the invasion mention seeking an \"Ordained Receptacle,\" but that is all. Some years late, remnants of the Kamal invasion would usurp the Imperial throne from the heirs of the &lt;a href=\"Warlord%20Attrebus\"&gt;Warlord Attrebus&lt;/a&gt;. They would work with the Akaviri-&lt;a href=\"Rimmen\"&gt;Rimmen&lt;/a&gt; to reestablish the Empire, but their attempts would inevitably fail."}

He is also known as &lt;a href=\"Satak\"&gt;Satak&lt;/a&gt;'s Hungry Stomach.\nIn Yokudan folklore, Akel is the hungry stomach of Satak. When the worlds on Satak's scales cried for help because they were not given a chance to be, they received help from the Hungry Stomach. Akel made Satak hungry, and so Satak began eating itself, thus leaving room for things to begin. Eventually, Akel made Satak bite his own heart, causing the First Serpent to die. However, the Hunger would not stop, and so Satak shed its skin and Satakal began. The Hungry Stomach continued to affect Satakal, causing it to eat itself &lt;a href=\"Kalpa\"&gt;over and over again&lt;/a&gt;. \nEventually, some spirits learned to escape the constant cycle of Satakal eating itself, through a method known as the Walkabout. &lt;a href=\"Ruptga\"&gt;Ruptga&lt;/a&gt; was the strongest of these spirits, and placed stars in the sky to guide other spirits on this journey. in time, Ruptga had saved so many spirits that he could not act as a guide to them all, and so he created &lt;a href=\"Sep\"&gt;Sep&lt;/a&gt; from Satakal's shed skins. Because Sep was created from Satakal, Sep also suffered from the Hungry Stomach, often causing him to eat the spirits he was supposed to help.\nSep eventually decided it was easier to create a new world from Satakal's skins, and tricked many of the other spirits into joining him. When Ruptga punished him for this, a pearl fell out of Sep's pocket and became covered with sand. It is said that if this pearl is cleansed, the Hungry Stomach will finally be full."}

She is encountered again later, as ally or enemy, during the &lt;a href=\"Civil%20War\"&gt;Civil War&lt;/a&gt; questline.\nIrileth is one of four housecarls in the game who is not a &lt;a href=\"Nords%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Nord&lt;/a&gt;. The others are &lt;a href=\"Faleen\"&gt;Faleen&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"Redguards%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Redguard&lt;/a&gt; housecarl of &lt;a href=\"Jarl%20Igmund\"&gt;Jarl Igmund&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"Markarth%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Markarth&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Rayya\"&gt;Rayya&lt;/a&gt;, also a Redguard, who is the housecarl of the &lt;a href=\"Thane%20%28Title%29\"&gt;Thane&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"Falkreath%20Hold%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Falkreath Hold&lt;/a&gt;, and the fourth is &lt;a href=\"Teeba-Ei\"&gt;Teeba-Ei&lt;/a&gt; who becomes the housecarl to &lt;a href=\"Sorli%20the%20Builder\"&gt;Sorli the Builder&lt;/a&gt; if she becomes Jarl of Hjaalmarch during the Civil War.\nBackground.\nBeing early battle comrades, Irileth and Balgruuf agreed that she would be assigned as his Housecarl. It is known that Irileth is more protective of the Jarl than most Housecarls.\u00a0At some point in her life,\u00a0Irileth was trained by the Morag Tong guild of Morrowind.\nPersonality.\nIrileth is very serious about her job and her loyalty to Balgruuf, occasionally to the point of paranoia. Even after the Dragonborn kills &lt;a href=\"Mirmulnir\"&gt;Mirmulnir&lt;/a&gt;, Irileth remains distrustful of him/her, though she still tells the Dragonborn that she is glad that they are on her side. She does not seem to care much about &lt;a href=\"Skyrim\"&gt;Skyrim&lt;/a&gt;'s traditions or tales; after Mirmulnir is slain, she refuses to involve herself in debating about the Dragonborn's identity; she is simply relieved that the dragon is dead.\nIf the Dragonborn visits Irileth in the &lt;a href=\"Blue%20Palace%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Blue Palace&lt;/a&gt;\u00a0after claiming Whiterun for the\u00a0&lt;a href=\"Stormcloaks\"&gt;Stormcloaks&lt;/a&gt;, she speaks of the many dark ways she has dreamt of the Dragonborn's death. Additionally, she is very suspicious of the Dragonborn, approaching them with her weapon drawn and saying that she has constantly got her eye on them.\nInteractions.\n&lt;a href=\"Dragon%20Rising\"&gt;Dragon Rising&lt;/a&gt;.\nWhen Mirmulnir attacks the &lt;a href=\"Western%20Watchtower\"&gt;Western Watchtower&lt;/a&gt;, Irileth is quick to arrive and inform Farengar and Balgruuf of such. The group then converses with a &lt;a href=\"Hold%20Guard\"&gt;guard&lt;/a&gt; who witnessed the dragon arriving. Balgruuf decides to send Irileth to the watchtower to deal with the issue, and opts to send the Dragonborn as well. Irileth shortly gathers some men by the main gate, where she convinces them that the honor to kill the dragon is Whiterun's. \nThe party heads west, where she orders the group to search for survivors while the dragon is out of sight. After conversing with the only survivor at the watchtower, Mirmulnir returns, and so Irileth leads the battle against him. Once the dragon is downed, she witnesses the Dragonborn absorb his &lt;a href=\"Dragon%20Soul\"&gt;soul&lt;/a&gt;; however, unlike the guards, she does not praise the Dragonborn for being Dovahkiin, but rather for simply killing the dragon. She then assumes command of the watchtower for the time being and orders the Dragonborn to report back to Balgruuf.\n&lt;a href=\"Skyrim%20Civil%20War\"&gt;Civil War&lt;/a&gt;.\nIf the Dragonborn\u00a0sides with the &lt;a href=\"Imperial%20Legion%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Imperial Legion&lt;/a&gt;, then the Dragonborn will fight alongside Irileth to protect &lt;a href=\"Whiterun%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Whiterun&lt;/a&gt; from the Stormcloaks. Alternatively, siding with the Stormcloaks means the Dragonborn must fight Irileth, along with Balgruuf and several of the &lt;a href=\"Whiterun%20Guard\"&gt;Whiterun Guard&lt;/a&gt;s.\nAfter &lt;a href=\"Vignar%20Gray-Mane\"&gt;Vignar Gray-Mane&lt;/a&gt; becomes &lt;a href=\"Jarl\"&gt;Jarl&lt;/a&gt; of Whiterun, Irileth, as well as Balgruuf and &lt;a href=\"Proventus%20Avenicci\"&gt;Proventus&lt;/a&gt;, travels to the &lt;a href=\"Blue%20Palace%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Blue Palace&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Solitude%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Solitude&lt;/a&gt;, seeking refuge with the\u00a0Imperial\u00a0loyalist,\u00a0&lt;a href=\"Elisif%20the%20Fair\"&gt;Elisif the Fair&lt;/a&gt;.\nCombat.\nIrileth wields a frost-enchanted &lt;a href=\"Steel%20Sword%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;steel sword&lt;/a&gt; and an &lt;a href=\"Elven%20Bow%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Elven Bow&lt;/a&gt;.

Jarl Balgruuf is not receiving visitors.\"\n\"That was the hairiest fight I've ever been in, and I've been in more than a few.

I'm taking command here for the moment. You head back to Whiterun and let the Jarl know what happened.\"\nConversations.\nIrileth: \"The Jarl has finally agreed to send you back to Riverwood.\"\nWhiterun Guard: \"Yes, Housecarl. We'll leave immediately.\"\nWhiterun Guard 2: \"It's just us against a dragon, is that it?\"\nIrileth: \"I can't afford to send anyone else. And we don't know where the dragon is. Your main job will be to keep an eye out and get the people to safety if the town is attacked. I don't expect the three of you to fight off a dragon by yourselves. But I do expect you to do your duty.\"\nWhiterun Guard: \"Of course. We'll keep Riverwood safe. You can count on it. Let's move out. Time's a wasting.\"\nIrileth: \"Farengar! Farengar, you need to come at once. A dragon's been sighted nearby. should come, too.\"\nFarengar: \"A dragon! How exciting! Where was it seen? What was it doing?\"\nIrileth: \"I'd take this a bit more seriously if I were you. If a dragon decides to attack Whiterun, I don't know if we can stop it. Let's go.\"\nBalgruuf: \"So, Irileth tells me you came from the western watchtower?\"\nWhiterun Guard: \"Yes, my lord.\"\nIrileth: \"Tell him what you told me. About the dragon.\"\nWhiterun Guard: \"Uh... that's right. We saw it coming from the south. It was fast... faster than anything I've ever seen.\"\nBalgruuf: \"Wat did it do? Is it attacking the watchtower?\"\nWhiterun Guard: \"No, my lord. It was just circling overhead when I left. I never ran so fast in my life... I thought it would come after me for sure.\"\nBalgruuf: \"Good work, son. We'll take it from here. Head down to the barracks for some food and rest. You've earned it. Irileth, you'd better gather some guardsmen and get down there.\"\nIrileth: \"I've already ordered my men to muster near the main gate.\"\nBalgruuf: \"Good. Don't fail me.\"\nAfter a brief conversation between the Jarl and the Dragonborn, the conversation continues:\nFarengar: \"I should come along. I would very much like to see this dragon.\"\nBalgruuf: \"No. I can't afford to risk both of you. I need you here working on ways to defend the city against these dragons.\"\nFarengar: \"As you command.\"\nBalgruuf: \"One last thing, Irileth. This isn't a death or glory mission. I need to know what we're dealing with.\"\nIrileth: \"Don't worry, my lord. I'm the very soul of caution.\"\nIrileth: \"Here's the situation. A dragon is attacking the Western Watchtower.\"\nWhiterun Guard: \"A dragon?\"\nWhiterun Guard 2: \"Now we're in for it.\"\nWhiterun Guard 3: \"What?\"\nIrileth: \"You heard right! I said a dragon! I don't much care where it came from or who sent it. What I do know is that it's made the mistake of attacking Whiterun!\"\nWhiterun Guard: \"But Housecarl... how can we fight a dragon?\"\nIrileth: \"That's a fair question. None of us have ever seen a dragon before, or expected to see one in battle. But we are honorbound to fight it, even if we fail. This dragon is threatening our homes... our families. Could you call yourselves Nords if you ran from this monster? Are you going to let me face this thing alone?\"\nWhiterun Guard: \"No, Housecarl!\"\nWhiterun Guard 2: \"We're so dead...\"\nIrileth: \"But it's more than our honor at stake here. Think of it - the first dragon seen in Skyrim since the last age. The glory of killing it is ours, if you're with me! Now what do you say? Shall we go kill us a dragon?\"\nWhiterun Guard: \"Yeah!\"\nWhiterun Guard 2: \"Damn right!\"\nWhiterun Guard 3: \"Yeah!\"\nIrileth: \"Let's move out.\"\nAt the Western Watchtower:\nIrileth: \"No signs of any dragon right now, but it sure looks like he's been here. I know it looks bad, but we've got to figure out what happened. And if that dragon is still skulking around somewhere. Spread out and look for survivors. We need to know what we're dealing with.\"\nWhiterun Guard: \"No! Get back! It's still here somewhere! Hroki and Tor just got grabbed when they tried to make a run for it!\"\nIrileth: \"Guardsman! What happened here? Where's this dragon? Quickly now!\"\nWhiterun Guard: \"I don't know! Kynareth save us, here he comes again...\"\nIrileth: \"Here he comes! Find cover and make every arrow count!\"\nAfter the &lt;a href=\"Last%20Dragonborn\"&gt;Dragonborn&lt;/a&gt; absorbs the dragon's soul:\nWhiterun Guard: \"Dragonborn? What are you talking about?\"\nWhiterun Guard 2: \"That's right! My grandfather used to tell stories about the Dragonborn. Those born with the Dragon Blood in 'em. Like old Tiber Septim himself.\"\nWhiterun Guard: \"I never heard of Tiber Septim killing any dragons.\"\nWhiterun Guard 3: \"There weren't any dragons then, idiot. They're just coming back now for the first time in... forever. But the old tales tell of the Dragonborn who could kill dragons and steal their power. must be one!\"\nWhiterun Guard 4: \"What do you say Irileth? You're being awfully quiet.\"\nWhiterun Guard 5: \"Come on, Irileth, tell us, do you believe in this Dragonborn business?\"\nIrileth: \"Hmph. Some of you would be better off keeping quiet than flapping your gums on matters you don't know anything about. Here's a dead dragon, and that's something I definitely understand. Now we know we can kill them. But I don't need some mythical Dragonborn. Someone who can put down a dragon is more than enough for me.\"\nWhiterun Guard 3: \"You wouldn't understand, Housecarl. You ain't a Nord.\"\nIrileth: \"I've been all across Tamriel. I've seen plenty of things just as outlandish as this. I'd advise you all to trust in the strength of your sword arm over tales and legends.\"\nWhiterun Guard 3: \"If really are Dragonborn, like the old tales, you aught to be able to Shout. Can you? Have you tried?\"\nWhiterun Guard 3: \"That was Shouting, what you just did! Must be. You really are dragonborn, then...\"\nIrileth will be found in Dragonsreach when &lt;a href=\"Ulfric%20Stormcloak%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Ulfric's&lt;/a&gt; axe is being delivered to Jarl Balgruuf, and the following conversation will take place about it:\nBalgruuf: \"Proventus, what do you make of all this? If Ulfric were to attack Whiterun...\"\nProventus: \"As in all things, lord, caution... I urge us to wait and see.\"\nIrileth: \"Prey waits.\"\nBalgruuf: \"I'm of a mind with Irileth. It's time to act.\"\nProventus: \"You plan to march on Windhelm?\"\nBalgruuf: \"I'm not a fool, Proventus. I mean it's time to challenge Ulfric to face me as a man, or march his Stormcloaks up to the gates.\"\nProventus: \"He'll do no such thing! A dagger in the back is all you could expect!\"\nIrileth: \"\"He was rather straightforward with &lt;a href=\"Torygg\"&gt;Torygg&lt;/a&gt;.\"\"\nProventus: \"Torygg? He simply walked up to the boy and murdered him!\"\nIrileth: \"\"That \"boy\" was High King of Skyrim.\"\nBalgruuf: \"I'm not the High King, but neither am I a boy. If Ulfric wants to challenge my rule in the Old Way, let him. Though, I suspect he'll prefer to send his \"Stormcloaks\" to do it for him.\"\"\nIrileth: \"True. He's already proven his personal strength. Now he seeks to prove his army's.\"\nProventus: \"Then might I urge you to consider General Tullius' request? I mean, if you are bent on offending Jarl Ulfric...\"\nIrileth: \"Ulfric is the one who has offended. But, Proventus has a point. Ulfric has made it clear; in his mind, to refuse his claim is to side with the Empire.\"\nProventus: \"And what harm is there in letting a few Legionnaires die in place of your own men?\"\nBalgruuf: \"It seems cowardly.\"\nIrileth: \"\"Was it cowardly then to accept the &lt;a href=\"White-Gold%20Concordat\"&gt;White-Gold Concordat&lt;/a&gt;?\"\"\nBalgruuf: \"This again? That was different. Was I given a chance to object to the terms of the treaty? No. The Jarls weren't asked. We were told. And we had to like it.\"\nProventus: \"The chests of gold didn't hurt.\"\nBalgruuf: \"Damnit! This isn't about gold!\"\nIrileth: \"It's time to decide.\"\nProventus: \"Lord, wait. Let us see if Ulfric is serious.\"\nBalgruuf: \"Oh, he's serious. But so am I.\"\nIrileth: \"Finally.\"\nFarengar: \"Incredible! Uh... sir, you have no idea how long I have waited for such an opportunity! I would be most appreciative if you would permit me to perform some, ah, tests on you. Purely in the interests of the advancement of knowledge.\"\nOdahviing: \"Begone, mage. Do not test my promise to the Dovahkiin.\"\nFarengar: \"I assure you, you will not even notice me. Most of them are hardly painful at all to a large dragon such as yourself.\"\nIrileth: \"Farengar, very bad idea. Even for you.\"\nFarengar: \"Surely you won't miss a few scales... or a small amount of blood...\"\nOdahviing: \"Joor mey! What are you doing back there? Yol... Toor...Shul!\"\nJarl Balgruuf the Greater: \"Farengar! Enough, fool!\"\nIrileth: \"Balgruuf, did you slip out again last night for a drink at the Bannered Mare?\"\nBalgruuf: \"Heard about that, did you? Yes, I went out for a pint or two. What of it?\"\nIrileth: \"These secret visits to the tavern will make you an easy target for an enemy assassin. You should have told me first.\"\nBalgruuf: \"Damn it, woman, I'm the Jarl of Whiterun! I won't apologize for talking to my people. You can't protect me every moment of the day.\"\nIrileth: \"That might be so, but it will never stop me from trying.\""}

Irinja was amused by the fine speaking manner of Attrebus.\nIrinja came across Attrebus when he secretly tried to explore the castle at night. Irinja revealed him than she knew who he really was. She told Attrebus that she had read all of his adventures. She promised not to tell anyone about his real identity. Irinja also offered to help him.\nIrinja avoided him during the following days. After Attrebus was hurt by a snow storm, Irinja finally decided to talk to Attrebus again. They shared some whiskey, and Attrebus kissed Irinja. They talked &lt;a href=\"Elhul%20Sathil\"&gt;Elhul Sathil&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Hleryn%20Sathil\"&gt;Hleryn Sathil&lt;/a&gt;'s son.

He killed his brothers and mothers, and he almost killed Irinja too. Lord Sathil ordered to imprison his son in the depths of the castle with the sword. After the conversation, they had a night of passion.\nIrinja led Attrebus and Sul to the dungeons of the castle. When they were near the gate, she told them that she would rather not go any further. Attrebus and Sul followed down the stairs. Sul ventured into the darkness while Attrebus waited at the gate. Yet, Nirai closed the door and trapped him inside. She revealed him that Irinja had told her their intentions."}

Even if accessed from above, the door would still remain locked. \nOverview.\nIrkngthand harbors the only known statue of a &lt;a href=\"Snow%20Elf\"&gt;Snow Elf&lt;/a&gt;, before the betrayal by the &lt;a href=\"Dwemer\"&gt;Dwemer&lt;/a&gt; caused them to degenerate into the vengeful &lt;a href=\"Falmer%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Falmer&lt;/a&gt;.\nIn the courtyard of the ruin there are five &lt;a href=\"Bandits%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;bandits&lt;/a&gt; and a &lt;a href=\"Containers%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;chest&lt;/a&gt;. All but one of the entrances to the interior of the ruin have collapsed. Approaching northeast from &lt;a href=\"Shearpoint\"&gt;Shearpoint&lt;/a&gt; allows entrance by descending from the mountains, and, if carried out correctly, can lead the Dragonborn immediately to the &lt;a href=\"Bandit%20Chief\"&gt;Bandit Chief&lt;/a&gt;, avoiding the other enemies.\nDue to the high numbers of Falmer, &lt;a href=\"Chaurus%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Chaurus&lt;/a&gt; and other undesirables which inhabit the ruin, Irkngthand is one of the most difficult Dwemer sites to explore, although a high &lt;a href=\"Sneak%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Sneak&lt;/a&gt; skill can prevent conflict within several areas, notably the Irkngthand Slave Pens, in which it is possible to sneak through the entire section without engaging a single enemy.\nQuests.\nBlindsighted.\nAfter the Dragonborn becomes a &lt;a href=\"Nightingale\"&gt;Nightingale&lt;/a&gt;, they are tasked with meeting &lt;a href=\"Karliah\"&gt;Karliah&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Brynjolf%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Brynjolf&lt;/a&gt; at Irkngthand in order to team up and stop Mercer from stealing the &lt;a href=\"Eyes%20of%20the%20Falmer\"&gt;Eyes of the Falmer&lt;/a&gt; and from keeping the &lt;a href=\"Skeleton%20Key%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Skeleton Key&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe trio delves deep into the ruins, until they find Mercer taking the legendary Eyes from an ancient Snow Elf statue in a large hall. The room's ceiling begins to collapse, and, after defeating Mercer and taking back the artifacts, the Nightingales escape by taking advantage of the water flooding the room and swimming into a clearing, and out of the ruins, emerging in &lt;a href=\"Bronze%20Water%20Cave\"&gt;Bronze Water Cave&lt;/a&gt;.\nNotable items.\nAlchemy ingredients.\nFor an alchemist, Irkngthand features a treasure trove of &lt;a href=\"Alchemy%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;alchemical&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Ingredients%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;ingredients&lt;/a&gt;. As with any Dwemer ruin, it is possible to loot &lt;a href=\"Dwarven%20Oil%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Dwarven Oil&lt;/a&gt; from the remains of automatons, whilst Falmer often drop &lt;a href=\"Falmer%20Ear\"&gt;Falmer Ear&lt;/a&gt;s, and occasionally other alchemical ingredients. Additionally, the existence of Chaurus within the ruins provides &lt;a href=\"Chaurus%20eggs\"&gt;Chaurus eggs&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Chaurus%20Hunter%20Antennae\"&gt;Chaurus Hunter Antennae&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Skeever%20Tail\"&gt;Skeever Tail&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"Charred%20Skeever%20Hide\"&gt;Charred Skeever Hide&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Spider%20Egg%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Spider Eggs&lt;/a&gt; can also be obtained.\nFinally, Falmer have apparently taken to cultivating fungi within the dungeon. As a result, a variety of fungi can be harvested, including &lt;a href=\"Imp%20Stool%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Imp Stool&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Blisterwort\"&gt;Blisterwort&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Bleeding%20Crown\"&gt;Bleeding Crown&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"White%20Cap%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;White Cap&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Namira%27s%20Rot%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Namira's Rot&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Fly%20Amanita%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Fly Amanita&lt;/a&gt;, whilst &lt;a href=\"Glowing%20Mushroom%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Glowing Mushrooms&lt;/a&gt; can often be harvested from the walls of the ruin."}

An intense rivalry exists between Iron-Breaker Mine and &lt;a href=\"Quicksilver%20Mine\"&gt;Quicksilver Mine&lt;/a&gt;, the workers of which are constantly trying to outperform each other in the amount of ore that they can dig up. However, the main competition is not in the amount, but the price, which the aptly-named Quicksilver Mine dominates almost without effort, with its rare and extremely valuable &lt;a href=\"Quicksilver%20Ore%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;quicksilver ore&lt;/a&gt;. One of the Iron-Breaker workers often expresses their disdain for the worth and workers of their rival.\nMiners.\nThere are several workers that work inside the mine during the day, stooped over the numerous veins of iron ore as they labor to extract it from the earth. Most work quietly, intent on simply doing their job and getting their pay. Others vehemently express their dislike for the conditions they must endure, and their paltry amount of gold they earn for the work they do. One frequently states his unhappiness about the workers of Quicksilver Mine.\nInteractions.\nInside the mine, there are several pickaxes spread throughout the shaft on tables or leaning against the walls. All the veins can be mined, and the ore taken to the smelter just outside the entrance and smelted into &lt;a href=\"Iron%20Ingot%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;iron ingots&lt;/a&gt;, which can then be used to create and improve iron weapons and armor at the blacksmith's forge just down the hill. Also, there are two small carts just outside the entrance\u2013one is empty and the other is packed with a few small crates and some chunks of iron ore."}
