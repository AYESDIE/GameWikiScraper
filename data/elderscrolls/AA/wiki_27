The worlds on Satak's scales did not get a chance to be, so they pleaded for help, but there was nothing outside of Satak, so help came from within, in the form of &lt;a href=\"Akel\"&gt;Akel&lt;/a&gt;, the Hungry Stomach.

{"id": "3120", "revid": "44917185", "url": "https://elderscrolls.fandom.com/wiki?curid=3120", "title": "Satakal", "text": "Satakal, also known as the Worldskin, is the &lt;a href=\"Yokuda\"&gt;Yokuda&lt;/a&gt;n god of everything. He is a fusion of the concepts of &lt;a href=\"Anu\"&gt;Anu&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Padomay\"&gt;Padomay&lt;/a&gt;. In essence, Satakal is much like the &lt;a href=\"Nord\"&gt;Nord&lt;/a&gt;ic &lt;a href=\"Nordic%20Pantheon\"&gt;god&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Alduin\"&gt;Alduin&lt;/a&gt;, who destroys one world to begin the next. Satakal does this by repeatedly eating himself and then shedding his skin to begin a new world. In Yokudan mythology, Satakal had done this many times over, a cycle which prompted the birth of spirits that could survive the transition. These spirits ultimately became the &lt;a href=\"Redguard%20Pantheon\"&gt;Yokudan pantheon&lt;/a&gt;.\nBackground.\nIn Redguard legends, Satakal came into being after &lt;a href=\"Akel\"&gt;Akel&lt;/a&gt;, the hungry stomach, made the first serpent &lt;a href=\"Satak\"&gt;Satak&lt;/a&gt; bite its own heart. Satak died but the hunger refused to stop, so Satak shed its skin, and Satakal was born. At this point, spirits began to see that there were patterns in the universe, and that they had a part in it, so they started taking names like &lt;a href=\"Ruptga\"&gt;Ruptga&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Tu%27whacca\"&gt;Tu'whacca&lt;/a&gt;. Satakal would continue to eat itself over and over, and some spirits eventually learned how to avoid this cycle. Led by Ruptga, this led them to invent the Walkabout. One of the spirits, called &lt;a href=\"Sep\"&gt;Sep&lt;/a&gt;, eventually made a new world out of all Satakal's shed skins and convinced many of the other spirits to join him there as this was easier than the walkabout, but they soon started dying due to their distance from Satakal.\nSatakal formed from the interplay of the Yokudan equivalents of Anu and Padomay, and as such is in essence the &lt;a href=\"Aurbis\"&gt;Aurbis&lt;/a&gt;.\nHunger of Satakal.\nThe Hunger of Satakal was a major problem for the Yokudan deities. &lt;a href=\"Ruptga\"&gt;Ruptga&lt;/a&gt; was the first to circumvent this problem, and taught the others to do likewise, however, soon, he needed to make a new god, called &lt;a href=\"Sep\"&gt;Sep&lt;/a&gt;, who was driven mad by the Hunger of Satakal.\nWorship.\nSatakal is a popular god of the &lt;a href=\"Alik%27r%20Desert\"&gt;Alik'r nomads&lt;/a&gt;. Worship of Satakal is more common among the &lt;a href=\"Crowns\"&gt;Crown&lt;/a&gt; Redguards, as opposed to the &lt;a href=\"Forebears\"&gt;Forebears&lt;/a&gt; who are more similar to cyrodilics in their religious views. Satakal once appeared to a prince named Ar-Azal and helped him solve the question of how to get the &lt;a href=\"Crowns\"&gt;Crowns&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Forebears\"&gt;Forebears&lt;/a&gt; to unite."}

The regional deity is &lt;a href=\"Julianos\"&gt;Julianos&lt;/a&gt;. Satakalaam is a religious city named after the Yokudan god named &lt;a href=\"Satakal\"&gt;Satakal&lt;/a&gt;. The &lt;a href=\"Motalion%20Necropolis\"&gt;Motalion Necropolis&lt;/a&gt; is a large necropolis that is located north of Satakalaam, and is the largest burial ground in the &lt;a href=\"Alik%27r%20Desert\"&gt;Alik'r Desert&lt;/a&gt;.\nDescription.\nGeography.\nThe city-state of Satakalaam is located on the eastern edge of the Alik'r Desert, in the rugged lands of Tigonus. Satakalaam is one of the smaller cities in the region but is well guarded due to the natural barries the &lt;a href=\"Dragontail%20Mountains\"&gt;Dragontail Mountains&lt;/a&gt; had given the city. The County of Satakalaam is on the southern end of the &lt;a href=\"Bjoulsae%20River\"&gt;Bjoulsae Estuary&lt;/a&gt; and is bordered by several different nations including the &lt;a href=\"Barony%20of%20Lainlyn\"&gt;Barony of Lainlyn&lt;/a&gt; to the west and the &lt;a href=\"Fiefdom%20of%20Totambu\"&gt;Fiefdom of Totambu&lt;/a&gt; to the south. Satakalaam is also located in the Crowns territory, which is evident with the nation's name as well as neighboring cities such as Totambu, places with a &lt;a href=\"Yokudan\"&gt;Yokudan&lt;/a&gt; influence. During the &lt;a href=\"Warp%20in%20the%20West\"&gt;Warp in the West&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"3E%20417\"&gt;3E 417&lt;/a&gt;, the County of Satakalaam was annexed into the Forebears &lt;a href=\"Kingdom%20of%20Sentinel\"&gt;Kingdom of Sentinel&lt;/a&gt;, which extends as far as &lt;a href=\"Abibon-Gora\"&gt;Abibon-Gora&lt;/a&gt; to the edge &lt;a href=\"Mournoth\"&gt;Mournoth&lt;/a&gt;.\nSatakalaam city itself is somewhat small. Northwest is the &lt;a href=\"High%20Temple\"&gt;High Temple&lt;/a&gt;, a temple dedicated to the &lt;a href=\"Redguard%20Pantheon\"&gt;Redguard Pantheon&lt;/a&gt;. The area around the High Temple is the central hub of the city, where many different nobles and citizens come to gather, whether it is to socialize or to trade among one another. South Satakalaam is well-fortified, with gates and guard towers guarding the main entrance to the Tigonus wastes. West of Satakalaam is the &lt;a href=\"Motalion%20Necropolis\"&gt;Motalion Necropolis&lt;/a&gt;, one of the most extensive burial grounds in the Alik'r Desert, or even in northern Hammerfell. Many nobles ranging from the Kings of the Alik'r to the wicked warlocks of the wastes have been buried here. The center of Motalion is a vast canyon with tombs hanging from the cliffs and crashed onto the ground. It is possible that the crypt is a part of Satakalaam, considering their locations.\nHistory.\n&lt;a href=\"Second%20Era\"&gt;Second Era&lt;/a&gt;.\nDuring the &lt;a href=\"Interregnum\"&gt;Interregnum&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"2E%20582\"&gt;2E 582&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"Seventh%20Legion\"&gt;Seventh Legion&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"Cyrodiil\"&gt;Cyrodiil&lt;/a&gt; had invaded the province of &lt;a href=\"Hammerfell\"&gt;Hammerfell&lt;/a&gt; with the intent to conquer the province. With the help of &lt;a href=\"Magnifico%20Khorshad\"&gt;Magnifico Khorshad&lt;/a&gt;, the Imperial Legion had successfully captured the city-state of Satakalaam, via an Imperial smuggler tunnel through the Dragontail Mountains. News of this invasion had reached &lt;a href=\"King%20Fahara%27jad\"&gt;King Fahara'jad&lt;/a&gt; from the &lt;a href=\"Kingdom%20of%20Sentinel\"&gt;Kingdom of Sentinel&lt;/a&gt;, and his army had reached the city outskirts, with the intent of raiding the Imperial Legion. &lt;a href=\"General%20Thoda\"&gt;General Thoda&lt;/a&gt; of the Alik'r Army was leading the charge but was unable to break the Legion's defense. Around the same time, the &lt;a href=\"Withered%20Hand\"&gt;Withered Hand&lt;/a&gt; had invaded the Alik'r Desert using the undead against the Redguards. An agent of the Withered Hand, &lt;a href=\"Shiri\"&gt;Shiri&lt;/a&gt; had escaped into the Motalion Necropolis to revive the dead &lt;a href=\"Suturah\"&gt;Suturah&lt;/a&gt;. An agent of the &lt;a href=\"Daggerfall%20Covenant\"&gt;Daggerfall Covenant&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"Vestige\"&gt;Vestige&lt;/a&gt;, was tasked with hunting down Shiri but had to go through Satakalaam to reach the necropolis. General Thoda had ordered the Vestige to infiltrate Satakalaam, to sabotage the Legion and learn how they captured Satakalaam.\nThe Vestige was able to traverse Legion-infested Satakalaam and encountered Magnifico Khorshad in his manor, who had an entrance to the Imperial smuggling tunnels. Due to this treason, the Vestige killed the Magnifico and entered the Tunnel. Using the Legion's kindlepitch barrels, the Vestige destroyed the tunnel, preventing reinforcements from entering the city. General Thoda's forces were able to break the defenses and overwhelm the Imperial Legion, securing Satakalaam for the Daggerfall Covenant and the Kingdom of Sentinel.

Satakalaam existed among the twenty-three other nations of the &lt;a href=\"Iliac%20Bay\"&gt;Iliac Bay&lt;/a&gt;.

The County of Satakalaam was annexed into the Kingdom of Sentinel along with other regions on the southern coast of the Iliac. Satakalaam has been a part of the Crowns ever since its inception, but with the absorption into Sentinel, it was forced to bow to their adversaries."}

Originally a Nedic fort captured by Yokudans, Hel Ra was one of the easternmost of the Ra Gada domains, and one of the few to survive into modernity. It grips the sheer side the tall mountain Heldorn Mount, and once oversaw a nearby Yokudan city. Sealed by ancient methods for thousands of years, Hel Ra Citadel long remained a revered remnant of \"old Yokuda\" in Hammerfell. It was re-opened and briefly occupied by the Celestial Warrior and the re-awakened Anka-Ra during the Interregnum, until they were vanquished by the Undaunted. The nearby town of Heldorn was later refounded at the site of the old city.\nHistory.\n&lt;a href=\"First%20Era\"&gt;First Era&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe site of Hel Ra Citadel was originally a Nedic fort. When the warriors of the Ra Gada arrived in Hammerfell after 1E 808, some of the fiercest cohorts marched far inland in search of domains to claim. One of these groups was The Four, a group of Yokudan Ansei who had special favor from the Warrior Stars and captured the fort. The Yokudans modified what remained of the Nedic fort into the Hall of the Warrior, an innermost chamber they then filled with coveted statues. Hel Ra remained one of the easternmost of the Ra Gada domains, serving to protect the Yokudan city found downhill from the Citadel and as a training ground Ansei warriors. According to legend, Ansei wishing to earn the elite title of First Rank were required to give up their most treasured weapons and war materiel before undertaking the grueling initiation ritual. If they succeeded, they would no longer need conventional weapons.\nIn the First Era, the doors to the Citadel were shut following the Yokudan retreat, either by sorcery or craftsmanship. None could open it, including the &lt;a href=\"Second%20Empire\"&gt;Empire&lt;/a&gt;, leaving it deserted and untouched for millennia.\n&lt;a href=\"Second%20Era\"&gt;Second Era&lt;/a&gt;.\nControlled by the Celestial Serpent, the Celestial Warrior took up residence in the Citadel in 2E 582, opening up the doors for the first time in history. Naryu Virian was among those who entered the Citadel, and led the Anka Ra on a brief chase before fleeing. Many scholars journeyed inside, such as Elenaire who suspected Mirimdin's Ninth Blade or the Shehai of a First-Rank Ansei were found inside, and were never heard from again. A group of Undaunted newcomers attempted to conquer the Citadel, having the Anka-Ra sound their warhorn and making it as far as the Hall of the Warrior, but were unsuccessful.\nUnder permission of Kailstig the Axe, another group of Undaunted went in and fought off the Anka-Ra, defeating the Air Monarch Ra Kotu (meaning Warrior's Edge), Yokeda Razul, and Rok'dun the Flame before fighting the Celestial Warrior. The Warrior unleashed their shehai, blasting open the walls of the Nedic chamber, but was ultimately defeated by the Undaunted and freed from the Serpent's control, joining the Celestial Thief in their quest to vanquish him.\nBy the time of the &lt;a href=\"Tiber%20Wars\"&gt;Tiber Wars&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"2E%20864\"&gt;2E 864&lt;/a&gt;, the town of Heldorn Mount was founded at the area, nestled within the Dragontail Mountains south of Dragonstar.\n&lt;a href=\"Third%20Era\"&gt;Third Era&lt;/a&gt;.\nDuring the Imperial Simulacrum in the late-Third Era, it was an active settlement was ruled by Baron Shetan and had a rivalry with Belkarth Guard. Heldorn Mount is neighbored by several settlements, including Drear to the west, Dragonstar to the north, and Skaven to the south."}

The fort itself is located within the mountain range south of the Craglorn region, supposedly creating a trade route which passed through these mountains. Since the Yokudan times, at an unspecified date, Hel Ra Citadel was closed off from the rest of Tamriel, unable to be opened by any manner, until the &lt;a href=\"Three%20Banners%20War\"&gt;Three Banners War&lt;/a&gt;; shortly after the conflict sparked, Hel Ra Citadel became the locale of encampment for the &lt;a href=\"Celestial%20Warrior\"&gt;Celestial Warrior&lt;/a&gt;'s &lt;a href=\"Anka-Ra\"&gt;Anka-Ra&lt;/a&gt; army, which was later defeated by a group of &lt;a href=\"Undaunted\"&gt;Undaunted&lt;/a&gt; sent by &lt;a href=\"Kailstig%20the%20Axe\"&gt;Kailstig the Axe&lt;/a&gt; during the events of .\nQuests.\n&lt;a href=\"Assaulting%20the%20Citadel\"&gt;Assaulting the Citadel&lt;/a&gt;.\nMultiple Undaunted delvers must enter Hel Ra Citadel and defeat the &lt;a href=\"Celestial%20Warrior\"&gt;Celestial Warrior&lt;/a&gt; and his residing Anka-Ra army. The quest is received from &lt;a href=\"Kailstig%20the%20Axe\"&gt;Kailstig the Axe&lt;/a&gt;, found both in the &lt;a href=\"Crossroads%20Tavern\"&gt;Crossroads Tavern&lt;/a&gt; and the entrance chamber of the trial.\nWalkthrough.\nThe group composition recommended for this trial is one tank, two healers, and nine damage-dealers. If wished to complete the difficult mode of the trial, it is recommended to replace a damage-dealer with a secondary tank.\nThe recommended abilities to be used for this trial are \"&lt;a href=\"Force%20Shock\"&gt;Force Shock&lt;/a&gt;\" and \"&lt;a href=\"Venom%20Arrow\"&gt;Venom Arrow&lt;/a&gt;.\"\nAs soon as the trial is entered, the delvers can find &lt;a href=\"Kailstig%20the%20Axe\"&gt;Kailstig the Axe&lt;/a&gt;, offering the quest \"Assaulting the Citadel.\" Past the entrance hall, a spectral apparition of the Warrior confronts the Undaunted delvers:\n\"The Warrior and his army of old Yokuda claim the citadel of Hel Ra. Leave\u2014and live. Trespass\u2014and die. You have been warned.\"\nAnd again on the way to the stone bridge leading to the Citadel:\n\"My soldiers of sand and steel will strip your flesh.\"\nAfter passing the bridge, an army of Anka-Ra is encountered, and the delvers must defeat it to reach the entrance to the Citadel.\nThe entrance is guarded by another army of Anka-Ra, this time accompanied by four &lt;a href=\"Anka-Ra%20War-Priest\"&gt;Anka-Ra War-Priest&lt;/a&gt;s and five &lt;a href=\"Anka-Ra%20Flame-Shaper\"&gt;Anka-Ra Flame-Shaper&lt;/a&gt;s. The tank must taunt the War-Priests, along with other Anka-Ra, and subjugate them to crowd control abilities to more easily neutralize them. Anka-Ra Flame-Shapers have a deadly fire ability which can be interrupted, and melee damage-dealers should keep an eye out for this moment.\nAfter the army is defeated, the gates are opened, and from them emerges the first boss of the trial.\n&lt;a href=\"Ra%20Kotu\"&gt;Ra Kotu&lt;/a&gt;.\nRa Kotu is an &lt;a href=\"Air%20Atronach\"&gt;air atronach&lt;/a&gt; of enormous size, and is accompanied by two War-Priests and a Destroyer. The tank should taunt Ra Kotu in a manner avoiding sweep attacks against other delvers, but not with his back towards the Citadel, as they must be healed. Healers should prioritize damage-mitigating abilities such as &lt;a href=\"Solar%20Prison\"&gt;Solar Prison&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Circle%20of%20Protection%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Ring of Preservation&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Barrier\"&gt;Barrier&lt;/a&gt;.\nDuring the fight, Gusts will spawn, an ability of Ra Kotu, and will target delvers randomly. Damage-dealers and healers should avoid these Gusts. Ra Kotu has a power attack which can be blocked by the tank. On veteran difficulty, this attack can be fatal, as it deals upwards of fifty-thousand damage (50K). Ra Kotu uses \"Six Sword Assault,\" where it throws four swords in a diagonal attack, which come back to it. If this attack hits a delver twice, it can prove fatal, but can be avoided by standing far away from Ra Kotu and dodging appropriately.\nWhen Ra Kotu reaches 30% in health, it will begin a periodic spin attack, and the tank must slowly avoid it while melee damage-dealers must stay away and adapt ranged combat. Alternatively, if the tanker is strong or experienced enough, they may utilize blocking and stand still, disallowing Ra Kotu any movement with the attack and therefore protecting the other delvers which may come to harm.\nAfter Ra Kotu is defeated, the delvers must split up before continuing the trial, as there are now two gates that are open\u2014southeastern, and north\u2014western (right and left). The tank, a healer, and four damage-dealers travel through the southeastern gate, while the remaining healer and five damage-dealers, or the secondary tank instead of a damage dealer, travel through the other. It is advised for the damage dealers that deal the most damage and the best healer to follow into the southeastern gate.\nThe southeastern group encounters three locked portcullis that must be opened up by the other group in the battlements. The first portcullis that must be passed after the entrance, where in it, oil is spilt in area-of-effect damage, and hordes of Anka-Ra warriors will descend from the gates, and will keep doing so until the portcullis is opened. The next portcullis introduces Gargoyles, exploiting their ability to petrify delvers in a cone attack, and smashing the ground nine times with periodically-increasing damage. The northwestern group climbs to the battlements on which various catapults and ballistae are located, meeting various Anka-Ra and Gargoyles near these siege weapons. The group will also encounter levers on the battlements, indicated by purple lanterns and a few deceased Undaunted lying near them. They are used to open the portcullis of the other group, and it is crucial for them to use these levers for the assault to carry on.\n&lt;a href=\"Yokeda%20Rok%27dun\"&gt;Yokeda Rok'dun&lt;/a&gt;.\nBefore Yokeda Rok'dun appears, he will cry out an order; \"Unleash our Ra Gada against the intruders! Crush them as we did the Nedes of old!,\" and subsequently the southeastern group must defeat, in order, the first wave, the second wave, and the third and final wave. The first wave is composed of an Anka-Ra War-Priest, and and two pockets composed of one Anka-Ra warriors and two welwae each, coming from the edges of the arena, emerging from sandy tombs. The next wave is composed of two pockets of Anka-Ra Destroyers leading two armored welwae each. The third and final wave is composed of a horde of welwae, both armored and unarmored, several Anka-Ra archers and two Anka-Ra Flame-Shapers.\nAfter these waves are defeated, Yokeda Rok'dun emerges, accompanied by two &lt;a href=\"Enraging%20Welwa\"&gt;Enraging Welwa&lt;/a&gt;. Yokeda Rok'dun will revive these welwa whenever they are defeated, so the focus of this fight should be solely on Rok'dun, and the tank should keep them away from Rok'dun and damage-dealers' area-of-effect abilities, as when they die, they multiply. When enough time has passed, the Enraging Welwa will enlarge and their damage will be increased, and the tank must bring them to Rok'dun so they can be killed.\nDuring the battle, Yokeda Rok'dun will create a small pillar of flame that spreads out in multiple directions, dealing high amounts of flame damage to anyone caught in it, so vampires should be wary. This attack is distance-sensitive, and is directed at a randomly-selected delver, meaning if the delvers are spread out more, this ability should not be dangerous.\n&lt;a href=\"Yokeda%20Kai\"&gt;Yokeda Kai&lt;/a&gt;.\nYokeda Kai is an Anka-Ra Flame-Shaper who, like Rok'dun, emerges from a gate after various enemies have been defeated.\nYokeda Kai has the ability to clone himself into four Flame-Shapers. The real Yokeda Kai retains his damage reduction and resistances, while the clones do not, and so die faster. This ability is periodic, and depending upon how fast Kai is dealt with, may be initiated many times. Due to Yokeda Kai being a Flame-Shaper, he retains the ability of one, and so must be interrupted along with his clones. During the battle a meteor may hit a random delver at any point in time, and so its area-of-effect must be avoided to not be killed. As the trial is bugged, the meteor would be spawned in double, making it the most dangerous ability in the trial. Kai will use another area-of-effect attack involving flames on the ground, indicated by him charging his staff. This attack is fatal if not avoided in time.\nThe roles of the delvers here is for each to assign themselves to Kai's clones and interrupt and defeat them in time. The healer is very important in this fight, as many of Kai's abilities deal high amounts of damage, and the damage dealers must be experienced enough to deal with Kai quickly.\nAfter these battles, both groups open their respective gates to the next section and reunite, but must now face a great army of Anka-Ra and two Gargoyles, along with pairs of War-Priests, Flame-Shapers, and Destroyers. Each of these enemies are guarding the stairs leading to the Hall of the Warrior, the delvers' final destination. On the opposite side of these stairs is a War-Priest guarding a Yokudan warhorn which, if blown in veteran difficulty, grants the delvers an &lt;a href=\"Achievements%20%28Online%29\"&gt;achievement&lt;/a&gt;. However, it will alert the entire army on the delvers, initiating combat in an uncomfortable manner.\nHealers must use ultimate abilities to deal with the enemies, and the tank must taunt the Gargoyles, War-Priests and Destroyers, prioritizing in this order. It is very difficult to juggle this amount of enemies, and so the tank must be extremely wary of not letting the gargoyles loose, lest the group will suffer the consequences. Damage-dealers must again be wary of the Flame-Shapers and their ability.\nWhen the army is defeated, the delvers must enter the Hall of the Warrior.\n&lt;a href=\"Celestial%20Warrior\"&gt;The Celestial Warrior&lt;/a&gt;.\nHere, the delvers travel through a cave tunnel, meeting on the way the Undaunted who came before, &lt;a href=\"Ludippe%20Guegan\"&gt;one of which&lt;/a&gt; is still clinging to life. The delvers then enter the Hall itself.\nIn the hall, there are two statues that create circles, the right one from the Warrior increasing damage output, while the left one increasing health recovery. Due to the presence of two healers, the right circle is made more lucrative for use.\n\"The Shehai of a first rank Ansei sank Yokuda. This Warrior's Shehai is beyond first rank.\"\nPrior to combat with the Celestial Warrior, the delvers can destroy &lt;a href=\"Hel%20Ra%20Statue\"&gt;Hel Ra Statue&lt;/a&gt;s in the Hall to invoke the Warrior's wrath and make the fight more difficult, thereby gaining an achievement; \"Hel Ra Citadel Difficult Mode,\" yet this endeavor is recommended to be attempted under a secondary tank in order to increase the group's survivability. The Statues are exclusive to the Veteran version of the delve.\nThe Celestial Warrior is a fearsome opponent and masterful fighter, and has several abilities in his arsenal. He will make a quote about most abilities while attacking.\nAt the end of the battle, with the Celestial Warrior defeated, he turns into dust and encounters the &lt;a href=\"The%20Thief%20%28Celestial%29\"&gt;Thief&lt;/a&gt;, and, depending on completion of the other two trials in Craglorn, &lt;a href=\"Sanctum%20Ophidia\"&gt;Sanctum Ophidia&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Aetherian%20Archive\"&gt;Aetherian Archive&lt;/a&gt;, the following dialogue may differ and include the &lt;a href=\"Celestial%20Mage\"&gt;Celestial Mage&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe Warrior: '\"The Serpent no longer clouds my mind. My sword will claim his neck.\"\"\nThe Thief: \"The Serpent belongs in the natural order. We will stop him, not murder him.\"\nThe Warrior: \"All talk and no action. Fall in behind me. The Serpent will learn his lesson.\"\nThe Warrior: \"My eyes are finally clear. My sword will claim the Serpent's neck.\"\nThe Thief: \"The Serpent belongs in the natural order. The three of us will contain him, not end him.\"\nThe Mage: \"Then we should return him to his Apex Stone. And seal it properly. Thrice\u2014if we have to.\"\nThe Warrior: \"To the Serpent's Stone, then. Fall in behind me. The snake will learn his lesson.\"\nThe Warrior: \"My mind is free of the Serpent's thrall. My sword hungers for his neck.\"\nThe Thief: \"The Serpent has been confined to his Stone. Now, come. There is still the Mage to free from his influence.\"\nThe Warrior: \"That is hearty work\u2014for a Thief. Fall in behind me. I will lead us to glory.\"\nThe Warrior: \"The Serpent no longer clouds my mind. Eyes clear, my sword will claim his neck.\"\nThe Thief: \"The Serpent has been confined to his Apex Stone, and the natural order is restored. But his attention will turn elsewhere. We should depart.\"\nThe Warrior: \"Surprisingly efficient. For a Thief and a Mage. Fall in line behind me. I will take charge from here.\"\nThe Mage: \"How gracious of you.\"\n&lt;a href=\"Mindil%20the%20Untested\"&gt;Mindil the Untested&lt;/a&gt; and Kailstig the Axe then meet the delvers once more. Mindil will give the reward for defeating the Celestial Warrior if the quest was not done for a week, Kailstig if the quest was done. The Hall itself is left in ruins.\nAchievements.\nThe following achievements can be obtained from this trial:"}

It was one of the only heavily inhabited settlements located in Falkreath Hold, apart from the city of &lt;a href=\"Falkreath%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Falkreath&lt;/a&gt; itself and &lt;a href=\"Half-Moon%20Mill\"&gt;Half-Moon Mill&lt;/a&gt;. It is destroyed in the &lt;a href=\"Unbound\"&gt;prologue&lt;/a&gt; by &lt;a href=\"Alduin%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Alduin&lt;/a&gt;.\nHelgen is the first location the &lt;a href=\"Last%20Dragonborn\"&gt;Dragonborn&lt;/a&gt; will visit at the beginning of the game. It is the nearest town to one of &lt;a href=\"Skyrim\"&gt;Skyrim&lt;/a&gt;'s borders, making it the most effective place to host the executions here after the Imperial ambush took place.\nBackground.\nHelgen was a thriving town and &lt;a href=\"Helgen%20Keep\"&gt;keep&lt;/a&gt; on the southern border of Skyrim with &lt;a href=\"Cyrodiil\"&gt;Cyrodiil&lt;/a&gt;. Before its destruction by &lt;a href=\"Alduin%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Alduin&lt;/a&gt;, the keep was controlled by the &lt;a href=\"Imperial%20Legion%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Imperial Legion&lt;/a&gt;.\nOn the 17th of &lt;a href=\"Last%20Seed\"&gt;Last Seed&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"4E%20201\"&gt;4E 201&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Ulfric%20Stormcloak%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Ulfric Stormcloak&lt;/a&gt; and a bodyguard of &lt;a href=\"Stormcloak%20Soldier\"&gt;Stormcloak Soldier&lt;/a&gt;s (including &lt;a href=\"Ralof\"&gt;Ralof&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Gunjar\"&gt;Gunjar&lt;/a&gt;) were sent to Helgen for public execution after being caught in a trap set by the Empire near &lt;a href=\"Darkwater%20Crossing%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Darkwater Crossing&lt;/a&gt;. Also among the prisoners was a &lt;a href=\"horse\"&gt;horse&lt;/a&gt; thief of &lt;a href=\"Rorikstead\"&gt;Rorikstead&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Lokir\"&gt;Lokir&lt;/a&gt;, and an individual later revealed to be the Dragonborn, who had also gotten caught up in an Imperial ambush while attempting to cross the border from &lt;a href=\"Cyrodiil\"&gt;Cyrodiil&lt;/a&gt;.\nAttempting to flee the execution, Lokir was killed by archers. Though the Dragonborn's name was not on the Empire's list of those to be executed, the &lt;a href=\"Imperial%20Captain\"&gt;Imperial Captain&lt;/a&gt; overseeing the executions ordered their death regardless. However, moments before the sentence was carried out, Helgen was attacked and destroyed by Alduin. The Dragonborn was among the survivors to escape in the resulting chaos.\nThe named residents of Helgen, besides &lt;a href=\"Haming\"&gt;Haming&lt;/a&gt;, are not seen again after the escape, and it can be assumed that they had either perished during the attack or managed to flee to safety. A few in-game days following the events, a small group of &lt;a href=\"Bandits%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;bandits&lt;/a&gt; will occupy the ruins of the town (the lock on either gate must be picked, or one of the bandits can open it). The damage caused by Alduin's attack will remain, with most of the town razed to the ground and burnt corpses lying among the ruins. The bandits are led by a &lt;a href=\"Bandit%20Chief\"&gt;chief&lt;/a&gt;, whose gear is randomized. Bottles of &lt;a href=\"Mead%20with%20Juniper%20Berry\"&gt;Mead with Juniper Berry&lt;/a&gt; may be found on the second floor of the ruined inn (accessed by jumping down from the gap in the tower's wall), if the Dragonborn returns.\nIt has a few distinguishing features: a wall, which is unusual for smaller towns, which some &lt;a href=\"hold\"&gt;hold&lt;/a&gt; capitals do not have. It also has a large keep, which is unusual for anywhere but forts and walled hold capitals. It is possible for Helgen to have been second in the Imperial chain of power in Skyrim, behind &lt;a href=\"Castle%20Dour%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Castle Dour&lt;/a&gt;, considering the strategic location not far from the southern border with Cyrodiil and midpoint for the northerly trade routes to &lt;a href=\"Whiterun%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Whiterun&lt;/a&gt;."}

Without this hole, the Dragonborn may not have been able to escape Helgen.\u00a0\nRevisited.\nReturning to Helgen later in the game reveals a myriad of burned out buildings and other destruction. A few corpses lay about the town containing tiny amounts of &lt;a href=\"Septim%20%28Coin%29\"&gt;gold&lt;/a&gt; (&lt;4) or &lt;a href=\"bone%20meal\"&gt;bone meal&lt;/a&gt;. Inside the keep, the Dragonborn can pass through many of the same chambers they did before, picking up any previously missed loot. Depending on how much time passed, the Town and Keep will be abandoned, or &lt;a href=\"Bandits%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;bandits&lt;/a&gt; may have moved in. The tunnels passed through during the escape may still be blocked by fallen stone shortly after the torture chamber, or the blockage may have been cleared and a wooden bridge built (may be related to how long bandits have been inhabiting the Keep before the Dragonborn's return). If the chamber where archers are encountered during the quest \"&lt;a href=\"Unbound\"&gt;Unbound&lt;/a&gt;\"\u00a0is\u00a0revisited, there will be a chest containing &lt;a href=\"Random%20Loot%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;levelled loot&lt;/a&gt;."}

He was notorious for his cunning character and scheming ways.\nHistory.\nEarly life.\nHelseth was born to Barenziah and Symmachus in &lt;a href=\"3E%20376\"&gt;3E 376&lt;/a&gt; and grew up in &lt;a href=\"Mournhold\"&gt;Mournhold&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Morrowind\"&gt;Morrowind&lt;/a&gt;. The birth of his sister, &lt;a href=\"Morgiah\"&gt;Morgiah&lt;/a&gt;, followed his after eight years. During the time of Helseth's youth, the tension between the &lt;a href=\"Septim%20Empire\"&gt;Septim Empire&lt;/a&gt; and Morrowind rose considerably. The residents of Mournhold gradually started to grow frustrated from the taxes forced by the Empire, as well as the lengthened working hours and raised tariffs appointed by King Symmachus. When Helseth turned fifteen, his father instructed Barenziah to flee with both their children to the &lt;a href=\"Imperial%20City\"&gt;Imperial City&lt;/a&gt;, fearing that he could no longer avoid a revolt of the citizens. Symmachus died by the hands of the rebels in &lt;a href=\"3E%20391\"&gt;3E 391&lt;/a&gt;, and his family members were branded as traitors. He would remain in the Imperial City until Barenziah escaped &lt;a href=\"Jagar%20Tharn\"&gt;Jagar Tharn&lt;/a&gt; with the help of &lt;a href=\"King%20Eadwyre\"&gt;King Eadwyre&lt;/a&gt;, bringing both he and Morgiah to &lt;a href=\"Wayrest\"&gt;Wayrest&lt;/a&gt;.\nPrince of Wayrest.\nShortly after arriving at the kingdom of Wayrest in &lt;a href=\"High%20Rock\"&gt;High Rock&lt;/a&gt;, Eadwyre married Barenziah and adopted Helseth and Morgiah. In &lt;a href=\"3E%20405\"&gt;3E 405&lt;/a&gt;, with his adoptive father gaining in years, Prince Helseth had to compete for the throne with &lt;a href=\"Elysana\"&gt;Elysana&lt;/a&gt;, the daughter of Eadwyre from his previous wife. However, Princess Elysana proved much too cunning, and eventually arose victorious from the power struggle. After the death of Eadwyre she became &lt;a href=\"Queen\"&gt;Queen&lt;/a&gt;, banishing Barenziah and Helseth.\nKing of Morrowind.\nAfter their exile from Wayrest, Barenziah and Helseth fled to Morrowind once again, where they were welcomed by &lt;a href=\"Athyn%20Llethan\"&gt;Athyn Llethan&lt;/a&gt;, Barenziah's uncle and King at the time. Soon after, King Llethan died, along with his protege &lt;a href=\"Talen%20Vandas\"&gt;Talen Vandas&lt;/a&gt;, passing the throne to Helseth. The circumstances surrounding their deaths were considered suspicious, as people that would inconvenience Helseth had been found dead in many occasions throughout the years. However, nothing could point directly to his involvement.\nWith the appearance of the &lt;a href=\"Nerevarine\"&gt;Nerevarine&lt;/a&gt;, Helseth felt threatened by the power and influence of the hero.

I have traveled extensively throughout this land, and here are but a few of my findings.\n&lt;a href=\"Bleeding%20Crown\"&gt;Bleeding Crown&lt;/a&gt;\nThe caps of these &lt;a href=\"Fungi%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;mushrooms&lt;/a&gt; do indeed appear smeared with blood, though it is often hard to see in the dark, damp places in which they grow. Not uncommonly found in Skyrim, their abundance is countered by the difficulty in acquiring them. As any experienced herbalist knows, the darkest of caves often conceal far more than mere mushrooms.\nNonetheless, these potent fungi, when combined with &lt;a href=\"Small%20Antlers\"&gt;certain powdered antlers&lt;/a&gt;, produce a mixture rendering one quite &lt;a href=\"Weakness%20to%20Poison%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;susceptible to poison&lt;/a&gt;. Their usefulness is also quite apparent when mixed with &lt;a href=\"lavender\"&gt;lavender&lt;/a&gt;, creating a substance highly &lt;a href=\"Resist%20Magic%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;resistant to magic&lt;/a&gt;.\n&lt;a href=\"Deathbell%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Deathbell&lt;/a&gt;\nFolklore abounds about this flower found in the swamps of &lt;a href=\"Hjaalmarch\"&gt;Hjaalmarch&lt;/a&gt;. Some stories claim it grows where unfortunate deaths have taken place, others insist it grows first and then lures unsuspecting people and animals to their doom. I have found no direct evidence to support these stories; indeed I found the flowers difficult to locate at all. While it is most well known for its use in &lt;a href=\"Poison%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;poisons&lt;/a&gt;, it would be remiss to overlook that the blooms of the deathbell are very effective in mixtures for &lt;a href=\"Fortify%20Alchemy\"&gt;boosting&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Alchemy%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Alchemy&lt;/a&gt; skill.\n&lt;a href=\"Dragonflies%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Dragonfly&lt;/a&gt;\nA surprising number of &lt;a href=\"insects\"&gt;insects&lt;/a&gt; survive in Skyrim's climate, many thriving in the lower, southern areas of the province. Dragonflies can be found in a great many places, and while catching them can be a daunting prospect, the reward is well worth the effort. It was beyond the scope of my research to determine whether the orange and blue dragonflies are fully different breeds or merely simple color variations, but through experimentation, I found that the orange dragonfly, when combined with the very hardy &lt;a href=\"Nordic%20Barnacle\"&gt;barnacles&lt;/a&gt; found along the coast, transfer some of their flighty nature, giving the herbalist some very nimble fingers.\n&lt;a href=\"Hagraven%20Claw\"&gt;Hagraven Claw&lt;/a&gt;\nThe claws of a &lt;a href=\"Hagraven%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;hagraven&lt;/a&gt; are best obtained in shops; it is inadvisable to suggest one collects them oneself. These creatures have traded in their humanity for access to powerful &lt;a href=\"magic\"&gt;magic&lt;/a&gt;s, and the transformations they undergo infuse their entire beings with some element of that power. Ingesting the powdered claws makes one more resistant to magic, but an especially curious property of the claws is revealed when mixed with &lt;a href=\"Snowberries%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;snowberries&lt;/a&gt; (often found in Skyrim's higher elevations). I found myself capable of &lt;a href=\"Fortify%20Enchanting\"&gt;comprehending enchantments&lt;/a&gt; I had believed mystifying after ingesting the mixture, and have passed the knowledge on to several &lt;a href=\"court%20wizard\"&gt;court wizard&lt;/a&gt;s who were grateful for the knowledge.\n&lt;a href=\"Jazbay%20Grapes%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Jazbay&lt;/a&gt;\nThere was a time when it would be considered treason to pick one of these grapes without express permission from the &lt;a href=\"Emperor\"&gt;Emperor&lt;/a&gt; himself. It is my understanding that although growers in Skyrim were successful in improving the fruit's survivability, it came at the cost of flavor. No longer is it quite the prize it once was. And yet, growing amidst the volcanic tundra of &lt;a href=\"Eastmarch%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Eastmarch&lt;/a&gt;, it is still immensely useful for concocting potions. Mages value it highly as it can be combined with simple &lt;a href=\"Garlic%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;garlic&lt;/a&gt; to enhance the &lt;a href=\"Regenerate%20Magicka%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;regeneration of magicka&lt;/a&gt;. While no longer against the law, picking these grapes in large amounts is best kept to oneself.\n&lt;a href=\"Luna%20Moth%20Wing\"&gt;Luna Moth Wing&lt;/a&gt;\nAs with the &lt;a href=\"Dragonflies%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;dragonflies&lt;/a&gt;, I was taken aback by the number of butterflies, moths, and other insects that manage to thrive in Skyrim. The Luna moth is especially beautiful; its thin, almost ephemeral wings seem too delicate to hoist anything into the air, giving them an almost magical appearance. Indeed, that sense extends to the properties they exhibit when crushed and distilled (an action I admit was difficult to perform at first, no matter my resolve to discover all that Skyrim has to offer. These creatures are simply that beautiful!) While they can be used for creating poisons that &lt;a href=\"Damage%20Magicka%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;damage magicka&lt;/a&gt;, I feel that would be a waste of their potential. Do not be alarmed if, when the wings are broken down almost completely, they appear to almost &lt;a href=\"Invisibility%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;disappear&lt;/a&gt; under your mortar. That very quality makes the wings quite effective in &lt;a href=\"Invisibility%20Potion\"&gt;potions of invisibility!&lt;/a&gt;\n&lt;a href=\"Tundra%20Cotton\"&gt;Tundra Cotton&lt;/a&gt;\nNot all &lt;a href=\"Nords%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Nords&lt;/a&gt; are savages wrapped in animal skins, howling at the moon. There are a wide variety of fabrics worn throughout the land, thanks in no small part to the stubborn Tundra Cotton &lt;a href=\"plant\"&gt;plant&lt;/a&gt;. It soaks up what rain it can in the plains west of &lt;a href=\"Whiterun%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Whiterun&lt;/a&gt;, and blooms frequently. When it does not exhibit any of the more striking alchemical properties, it is a staple in potions for not only &lt;a href=\"Fortify%20Magicka%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;fortifying magicka&lt;/a&gt;, but for resisting spells as well. I wonder what quality is what allows it to have adapted so well to this climate.\n&lt;a href=\"Nightshade%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Nightshade&lt;/a&gt;\nThe name and shape of this plant are known to all; long understood to be one of the more potent components in many poisons, the average Nord keeps his distance from the bright purple flowers nestled among dark leaves. It is exceedingly effective as a pure poison, but can also be combined with other compounds to &lt;a href=\"Lingering%20Damage%20Stamina\"&gt;stiffen joints&lt;/a&gt; as well. It is thus favored amongst those who wish to disable their opponents in battle, and can be found coating the blades of many of the more unsavory characters in Skyrim."}

To see men and women the size of large children, all with beards, would be a most disturbing sight. Still, whatever wrath the Dwarves brought from the gods that consumed an entire civilization surely must have been an awe-inspiring thing to witness.\nThe remnants of their civilization lie &lt;a href=\"Dwemer%20Ruins%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;buried&lt;/a&gt; in the hearts of mountains, and scholars and thieves the world over descend on the skeletal remains of dwarven cities like vultures, to scrape clean the bones of the past, old knowledge waiting to be exhumed and treasures to be discovered. But many men lay murdered in those halls of the damned, because those dwarven ruins do not release their treasures without a fight.\nMy kin would tell the stories long ago, when I was just a child, about how adept the Dwarves were at building machines. They would say that before our time, dwarves harnessed the power of the earth, and wielded fire and hammers to reshape steel and bronze with a mechanical brilliance that breathed life into these now ancient constructs of metal and magic. In the dark halls and chambers amid the ceasless droning of grinding gears and venting steam, they lie in wait to confound or destroy would-be plunderers of the dwarven sanctums, as the grim watchmen of the last vestiges of culture from a dead race.\nI descended into the humid darkness of &lt;a href=\"Mzulft%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Mzulft&lt;/a&gt;. The slow hiss of steam, creaking of metal and the rattle of old gears powering an empty city would unnerve most men. I could hear things in the darkness, skittering across the floor just out of sight and as I stepped over the bodies of plunderers or scholars who had not made it far, I knew it was not rats wandering these halls.\nSmall mechanical &lt;a href=\"Dwarven%20Spider%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;spiders&lt;/a&gt; set upon me with rapid movements, and machines sprouted from the walls and uncurled from &lt;a href=\"Dwarven%20Sphere%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;spheres&lt;/a&gt; into contraptions that rolled on top of gears for legs and crossbows for arms. I could not help but marvel at these single purpose machines built for the murder of men. My sword and my shield are my strength and I am undeterred by such things because I had heard of greater things that roam these depths, and indeed something else in these chambers stirred, and it echoed with massive weight. As it lumbered closer, its feet struck the ground as if walking on massive pistons and as it loomed out of darkness, I could see it clear for the first time, axe for one hand, hammer for the other, as tall as five men, made of dull bronze with a face molded in the image of its masters. A &lt;a href=\"Dwarven%20Centurion%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Steam Centurion&lt;/a&gt;. The stories were true, these were the guardians of the greatest dwarven treasures.\nWe fought, and the dwarves must truly be extinct because our battle was surely booming enough to wake the dead. It came at me with hammer and axe, inhuman strength and great fortitude, and a purpose of nothing but murder. I dodged as it crushed the stone around me with futile strikes and I thrust and slashed at it with my blade and took every opening afforded as we shook the halls with violence. I refuse to be undone by a machine.\nWhere the average man would be long dead, I stood over the husk of this dead automaton, its steam escaping like a final gasp. I could have taken the dwarven artifacts and metal but left them there for others, for I would not hex my journey with the possessions of dead men and maybe that is where countless others go wrong.\nI will continue to my journey across the lands, And perhaps one day will meet a worthy challenge, for I have yet to see what would make me tremble.\nHerbane's Bestiary: Hagravens.\n5 Sun's Dawn\nI have heard a tale most bizarre- a beautiful young woman cast out of town by the thrown stones of accusers for giving in to the dark arts. They say she fled into the &lt;a href=\"The%20Reach\"&gt;Reach&lt;/a&gt; and never reappeared, and justly so because they say the devilry of her magic had grown stronger with each new day. Shortly after, a witch of half woman and half bird had been sighted deep in the mountains, and as the sightings increased the young women began to disappear.\nThis tale has brought me to the Reach, where this witch they call a &lt;a href=\"Hagraven%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Hagraven&lt;/a&gt; makes home. With sword and shield at the ready, for I must see this creature and I must slay it.\n24 Sun's Dawn\nThe stomach of an average man would turn at the cruelty set before me- I first saw the thatch and bone, the human skulls, the dead goat head mounted on pikes, filthy animals pelts, loose entrails, and leathers matted in blood. I had heard that &lt;a href=\"Forsworn\"&gt;Forsworn&lt;/a&gt; revere and protect these Hagravens, and all around were their small, crude trinkets and to these witches on which sat dull, empty &lt;a href=\"Soul%20Gem%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;soul gems&lt;/a&gt;. What vile creature would live where all things are dead?\nDeeper into the lair, I heard it first- an unsteady shuffling, followed by a heaving, unforgettable stench. I thrust the torch in front of me and waited for my eyes to adjust to the tunnel of darkness ahead of me. I saw the silhouette of what I thought to be a frail woman on an awkward gait, but the light of the torch revealed something else. This Hagraven was horrifying, almost human but more an abomination of woman and creature fused together, nothing more than a husk of humanity surrendered in exchange for possession of the powers of dark magic. This magic corrupted her greatly, and her dull, glass eyes stared with hate from the visage of an old crone sat atop the body of a contorted, misshapen human body adorned with black feathers. It bristled as it let out a piercing scream, and as vivid red light began to form in the palm of its talons, it was all I could do to raise my shield in defense of magic most foul. I fought through devilry that seemed to snatch life from me, and the thought that this thing was once a woman seemed to play on my nerves.\nMost men would have crumbled, but I do not bend. The Hagraven is a most repulsive creature, and deserving of its fate and its &lt;a href=\"Hagraven%20Claw\"&gt;claws&lt;/a&gt; that are my trophy will tell the story of triumph. I have naught but to continue my travels and my conquests, for I have yet to see what would make me tremble.\nHerbane's Bestiary: Ice Wraiths.\n17 &lt;a href=\"Last%20Seed\"&gt;Last Seed&lt;/a&gt;\nWhen chill descended on me as I traveled further north through the frozen plains and mountains, I settled in at the inn at &lt;a href=\"Dawnstar%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Dawnstar&lt;/a&gt; for a moment of respite and a warm meal. Another traveler there told me to be cautious, that there are creatures who settle into the powder white of the snow with nary a clue to the careless, until it is too late. He went on and on, with wild gestures and fantastic tales of entire merchant expeditions being killed by the beasts. His stories frightened the other inn patrons, but I will not be turned by a coward's tale, I will see these for my own eyes, for those icy caves and peaks of the north are exactly the type of places that call to an adventurer like me. It did not take me long to find what I sought.\nThese &lt;a href=\"Ice%20Wraith%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Ice Wraiths&lt;/a&gt; are lucid, serpentine creatures of magic, as if conjured from the frozen tundra and glaciers of &lt;a href=\"Skyrim\"&gt;Skyrim&lt;/a&gt; itself. At one with an environment that makes them nearly invisible, these ethereal apparitions are the death of many &lt;a href=\"Nords%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Nords&lt;/a&gt;, if not by their sudden, unholy strike that casts their entire body through their target, then by the malady of &lt;a href=\"Witbane%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Witbane&lt;/a&gt;, a curse of infection that dulls the intellect and makes the target even more the victim.\nAs deadly as they are, Ice Wraiths are simple minded in their determination, and combat is a straight forward affair and brute force and a sharp blade are enough to fell these savage creatures. Only the heartiest of men would hope to survive just one of these beasts, but I have slain two with general ease.\nIt's good that I've found I can make decent coin selling the &lt;a href=\"Ice%20Wraith%20Teeth\"&gt;Ice Wraith's teeth&lt;/a&gt;, as they are a prized ingredient in alchemical potions. That will continue to afford me the opportunity to search these lands for a challenge worthy of story, for I have yet to see what would make me tremble."}

She served as their guiding and protective deity.\nHistory.\nSometime in the &lt;a href=\"First%20Era\"&gt;First Era&lt;/a&gt;, centuries before the cataclysm on Yokuda, an unknown force threatened the worship of Herd Mother. This drove the her followers on a legendary voyage to Tamriel.\nTales told by the Horsemen elders claim that an entire flotilla of \"swimming horse-ships\" was granted to them by their deity and before they finally reached the coast of &lt;a href=\"Rivenspire\"&gt;Rivenspire&lt;/a&gt;, their ships crossed \"seventeen seas.\" The fleeing Yokudans then settled in the &lt;a href=\"Silverhoof%20Vale\"&gt;Silverhoof Vale&lt;/a&gt; and remained there relatively undisturbed, keeping their tradition. They became known as the Horsemen. While the tall tales of their journey could be open to interpretation, it is believed that the Horsemen took their horses with them, when arriving from Yokuda, as the &lt;a href=\"Yokudan%20Charger\"&gt;Yokudan Charger&lt;/a&gt;, a horse breed found in &lt;a href=\"Hammerfell%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Hammerfell&lt;/a&gt;, were remarkably similar.\nTradition.\nTraditions of the Horsemen have some resemblance towards practices of the &lt;a href=\"Redguards%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Redguards&lt;/a&gt;. For example, similar to the Redguard tradition of &lt;a href=\"Walkabout\"&gt;Walkabout&lt;/a&gt;, young Horsemen must commune with the Herd Mother and go on a vision journey as a rite of passage to adulthood."}

It is not heresy to take arms and action in defense of true belief. We are the so-called Heretics of the Shivering Isles, but we do not speak heresy. We speak the truth.\nOur Lord, Sheogorath, is but a man. He is only flesh and blood, not a god, and certainly not a Daedric Prince. There are no princes in the realms of the Daedra, only vile servitors such as the Hungers that we summon to do our bidding.\n&lt;a href=\"Sheogorath\"&gt;Sheogorath&lt;/a&gt; the False is a mad despot.

{"id": "1977", "revid": "17401442", "url": "https://elderscrolls.fandom.com/wiki?curid=1977", "title": "Hermaeus Mora", "text": "Hermaeus Mora (), also known as Hoermius, Hormaius, Hermorah, Herma Mora, the Woodland Man, and the Gardener of Men, is the &lt;a href=\"Daedric%20Prince\"&gt;Daedric Prince&lt;/a&gt; of knowledge and memory; his sphere is the scrying of the tides of Fate, of the past and future as read in the stars and heavens. He is not known for being good or evil; he seems to be the keeper of both helpful and destructive knowledge, although he usually sees all seekers of any knowledge as his servants.\nBackground.\nAlso called the Demon of Knowledge, he is vaguely related to the cult origins of the &lt;a href=\"Morag%20Tong\"&gt;Morag Tong&lt;/a&gt; if only by association with his sibling, &lt;a href=\"Mephala\"&gt;Mephala&lt;/a&gt;. He usually chooses to appear to mortals as a void of darkness, or as a grotesque mass of tentacles and eyeballs.\nHe will offer potential servants knowledge that they desire in return for serving him, though many legends, such as those around his Nordic aspect &lt;a href=\"Herma-Mora\"&gt;Herma-Mora&lt;/a&gt; involve him tricking seekers to gain their knowledge. He is also known to betray his servants to their deaths when he perceives them as having outlived their usefulness to him. \nPlane of Oblivion.\nHermaeus Mora maintains a realm in &lt;a href=\"Oblivion%20%28Realm%29\"&gt;Oblivion&lt;/a&gt; called &lt;a href=\"Apocrypha\"&gt;Apocrypha&lt;/a&gt;, where all forbidden knowledge can be found. It is an endless library, with shelves stretching onward in all directions, stacks on top of stacks. Every book has a black cover with no title. Masses of ghosts move through the stacks, rifling through books, eternally searching for the knowledge they sought while living.\nThis realm can be accessed via &lt;a href=\"Black%20Books\"&gt;Black Books&lt;/a&gt;, which gives the reader special abilities. The halls are filled with &lt;a href=\"Seeker\"&gt;Seeker&lt;/a&gt;s who read books and guard the realm. Some areas have &lt;a href=\"Lurker\"&gt;Lurker&lt;/a&gt;s who also guard the realm and sometimes appear in the mortal realm, unlike the Seekers. It does, however, lack the ghosts mentioned in the above paragraph.\nThe realm of Apocrypha appears as an endless sea of roiling black oil, with greasy tentacles slithering about the waves beneath a green-tinged sky full of dark clouds and numerous portals through which Hermaeus Mora travels. Rising up from this sea are many cathedral-like structures built of crumbling stone and iron walkways, with books and scrolls crammed haphazardly into countless shelves or stacked in massive spiraling towers. The only known residents other than various ghosts are Seekers, Lurkers, and &lt;a href=\"Miraak\"&gt;Miraak&lt;/a&gt; together with his &lt;a href=\"Dragons%20%28Lore%29\"&gt;dragons&lt;/a&gt;.\nArtifacts.\nOghma Infinium.\nHermaeus Mora is associated with the ancient tome of knowledge, the \"&lt;a href=\"Oghma%20Infinium\"&gt;Oghma Infinium&lt;/a&gt;\", apparently given by Mora to &lt;a href=\"Xarxes\"&gt;Xarxes&lt;/a&gt;, the scribe of &lt;a href=\"Auri-El\"&gt;Auri-El&lt;/a&gt;. The knowledge was then, in turn, passed over to &lt;a href=\"Mehrunes%20Dagon\"&gt;Mehrunes Dagon&lt;/a&gt;, and was used to write the \"&lt;a href=\"Mysterium%20Xarxes\"&gt;Mysterium Xarxes&lt;/a&gt;\".\nThe &lt;a href=\"Eternal%20Champion\"&gt;Eternal Champion&lt;/a&gt; was able to retrieve the \"Oghma Infinium\" from the deep-frozen wastes of &lt;a href=\"Skyrim\"&gt;Skyrim&lt;/a&gt;; at that time Hermaeus Mora did not interfere. Then, the &lt;a href=\"Hero%20of%20Daggerfall\"&gt;Hero of Daggerfall&lt;/a&gt; was recorded as the wielder of the tome, sometime in the late &lt;a href=\"Third%20Era\"&gt;Third Era&lt;/a&gt;.\nBlack Books.\nBlack Books are tomes of esoteric knowledge that are artifacts of Hermaeus Mora, along with the \"Oghma Infinium\". The Black Books are not just regular books; when read, they transport the reader to the realm of Apocrypha. When the books are read inside Apocrypha, they transport the reader back to &lt;a href=\"Solstheim%20%28Dragonborn%29\"&gt;Solstheim&lt;/a&gt;, because Black Books can only be read in Solstheim. The books contain hidden knowledge that, when read, grants the reader great powers and abilities.\nSummoning.\nThe summoning date of Hermaeus Mora is the 5th of &lt;a href=\"First%20Seed\"&gt;First Seed&lt;/a&gt;. The &lt;a href=\"Hero%20of%20Daggerfall\"&gt;Hero of Daggerfall&lt;/a&gt; quested for the \"Oghma Infinium\" by summoning Hermaeus Mora.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Shrine%20of%20Hermaeus%20Mora\"&gt;Shrine of Hermaeus Mora&lt;/a&gt; is located on a remote plateau deep within the northwestern portion of the &lt;a href=\"Jerall%20Mountains\"&gt;Jerall Mountains&lt;/a&gt; (possibly because he is within the Pantheon of &lt;a href=\"Skyrim\"&gt;Skyrim&lt;/a&gt;, thus being closer to where he is worshipped). After following the path of requirement, the &lt;a href=\"Hero%20of%20Kvatch\"&gt;Hero of Kvatch&lt;/a&gt; was then able to summon Hermaeus Mora, and was asked to bring one soul of each of the sentient races of Tamriel, so that his followers are able to perform a divination. The Hero was then awarded the \"Oghma Infinium\", furthering their journey on the true path.\nSkyrim.\nTwo hundred years after the &lt;a href=\"Oblivion%20Crisis\"&gt;Oblivion Crisis&lt;/a&gt;, the tome would once again become lost. Upon finding an &lt;a href=\"Elder%20Scroll%20%28Dragon%29%23Elder%20Knowledge\"&gt;Elder Scroll&lt;/a&gt; housed within an &lt;a href=\"Oculory\"&gt;Oculory&lt;/a&gt; inside the &lt;a href=\"Tower%20of%20Mzark\"&gt;Tower of Mzark&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Blackreach%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Blackreach&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"Last%20Dragonborn\"&gt;Dragonborn&lt;/a&gt; returned to &lt;a href=\"Septimus%20Signus\"&gt;Septimus Signus&lt;/a&gt;, the crazed mage who told the Dragonborn where to find the &lt;a href=\"Elder%20Scroll%20%28Dragon%29\"&gt;Elder Scroll&lt;/a&gt; during \"&lt;a href=\"Discerning%20the%20Transmundane\"&gt;Discerning the Transmundane&lt;/a&gt;\" and 's &lt;a href=\"Main%20Quest%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Main Quest&lt;/a&gt;.\nSeptimus had given the Dragonborn a &lt;a href=\"Blank%20Lexicon\"&gt;Blank Lexicon&lt;/a&gt; which was needed to unlock the Oculory that the Elder Scroll was in. The Blank Lexicon was transformed into a &lt;a href=\"Runed%20Lexicon\"&gt;Runed Lexicon&lt;/a&gt;, and while doing this, the Lexicon absorbed the infinite amount of unknowable information contained within the Elder Scroll. Upon returning the Lexicon to Septimus, the mage used it to discover the way to open an ancient &lt;a href=\"Dwemer\"&gt;Dwemer&lt;/a&gt; vault. It turns out that Septimus is a follower of Hermaeus Mora, and had been told by the Daedric Prince that the vault contains an artifact of great knowledge and power, the &lt;a href=\"Heart%20of%20Lorkhan\"&gt;Heart of Lorkhan&lt;/a&gt;. In order to open the vault, Septimus must have a sample of blood from all the races of &lt;a href=\"Mer\"&gt;Mer&lt;/a&gt;, or Elves. This meant the blood of an &lt;a href=\"Altmer\"&gt;Altmer&lt;/a&gt;, a &lt;a href=\"Dunmer\"&gt;Dunmer&lt;/a&gt;, a &lt;a href=\"Bosmer\"&gt;Bosmer&lt;/a&gt;, an &lt;a href=\"Orsimer\"&gt;Orsimer&lt;/a&gt;, and a &lt;a href=\"Falmer\"&gt;Falmer&lt;/a&gt; to recreate the Dwemer blood needed to open the lockbox.\nUpon accepting the hunt for these samples of blood, the Dragonborn is contacted by Hermaeus Mora, who appears to them in the form of a &lt;a href=\"Wretched%20Abyss\"&gt;Wretched Abyss&lt;/a&gt;, or a collection of tentacles with one large eye, if is installed. Hermaeus Mora says that Septimus has been a useful tool, but his usefulness will have run out once the vault is open. To that end, Mora commands the Dragonborn to seek out the blood as requested by Septimus, but later after collecting the blood and returning to Septimus, and upon opening the Dwemer vault, Mora disintegrates the mage.\nIt is revealed that the artifact that was hidden within the Dwemer vault is the \"&lt;a href=\"Oghma%20Infinium\"&gt;Oghma Infinium&lt;/a&gt;\". After collecting the \"Oghma Infinium\", Mora once again appears as a void in front of the Dragonborn to name them as his new champion. As with previous incarnations of this tome, it functions as a skill tome that greatly boosts the skill levels of all talents relating either to warriors, rogues, or mages.\nSolstheim.\nSometime before the &lt;a href=\"First%20Era\"&gt;First Era&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"dragon%20Priest\"&gt;dragon Priest&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Miraak\"&gt;Miraak&lt;/a&gt; gave his allegiance to Hermaeus Mora in exchange for being granted the knowledge that would give him great power. With his newfound power, Miraak turned against his dragon masters but was confronted by &lt;a href=\"Vahlok%20the%20Jailor\"&gt;Vahlok the Jailor&lt;/a&gt;, another dragon priest. The battle lasted for days and, despite the outcome being unknown, Hermaeus Mora supposedly intervened, pulling his champion into the realm of Apocrypha to save him. Miraak remained as Mora's champion, albeit using his powers to his ends and plotting to escape Apocrypha.\nSometime during the &lt;a href=\"Fourth%20Era\"&gt;Fourth Era&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"Last%20Dragonborn\"&gt;Dragonborn&lt;/a&gt; traveled to Apocrypha through the use of a &lt;a href=\"Black%20Books\"&gt;Black Book&lt;/a&gt;, an artifact created by Mora to lure mortals into his realm. Mora then spoke to the Dragonborn and offered them the same power that was given to Miraak, as long as they defeated him. He also promised to teach the Dragonborn the second and third words of the &lt;a href=\"Bend%20Will\"&gt;Bend Will&lt;/a&gt; shout. The second word was given freely. However, the third word was granted in exchange for the &lt;a href=\"Skaal\"&gt;Skaal&lt;/a&gt;'s wisdom and the life of their shaman, &lt;a href=\"Storn%20Crag-Strider\"&gt;Storn Crag-Strider&lt;/a&gt;. After learning the second and third Words of Power, the Dragonborn traveled back to Apocrypha and battled with Miraak at the realm's summit. Near defeat, Miraak attempted to escape death by submerging himself into the waters of Apocrypha, but was promptly impaled by Mora's tentacles. Miraak then died of his wounds, and his soul was absorbed by the Dragonborn. Mora then gave Miraak's status as his Champion to the Dragonborn."}

The Hero of Dawnstar is a silent protagonist, but the lack of choices in-game makes the Hero come across as just a man (or woman) who is just following orders."}

Shadr explains that he was not able to pay her yet because the shipment of goods he had coming in was attacked.\nFurther listening reveals that it was almost certainly Sapphire herself who attacked the caravan and stole his shipment, she does not admit or deny the claim (though her behaviour suggests she really did do it). Even in light of this she still demands his payment \"or else.\" Sapphire will then leave and walk into &lt;a href=\"The%20Bee%20and%20Barb\"&gt;The Bee and Barb&lt;/a&gt; and Shadr will sit down on a bench on the bridge where the conversation took place.\nThe conversation.\nListen in on the conversation between Shadr and Sapphire. There is no actual quest log entry and this does not start the quest, but it is a part of the backstory and is the easiest way to start the quest as Shadr's location will be known. Only during the first visit to Riften can this conversation be overheard.\nAfter listening to the conversation, speak with Shadr. Shadr will explain his situation and the fear he has for his own life. Offer to assist him, he will seem very grateful. Now there should be a quest log entry under Miscellaneous.\nMissing the conversation.\nUpon entering Riften for the first time, if the conversation was missed from not sticking around, Shadr will no longer be sitting on the bench at the bridge. Shadr can usually be found at Riften Stables (where he works and lives) or walking around the lower docks of Riften (the same level as &lt;a href=\"The%20Ratways\"&gt;The Ratways&lt;/a&gt; entrance).\nSpeak with Sapphire.\nHead to The Bee and Barb, right at the entrance Sapphire can be seen leaning against a corner section of the wall. There is several different ways of dealing with Sapphire:\nReturn to Shadr.\nNo matter what option was selected, the quest will continue into another conversation with Shadr.\nIf Sapphire was convinced to leave Shadr alone was chosen, Shadr will be very grateful and will then become a friend. He will show this by rewarding the kind deed with a leveled invisibility potion, and will allow you to borrow a horse from Riften Stables.\nTo borrow a horse, simply approach the horses outside, if it says steal in red letters do not get on that horse, go to another until it says \"Ride Horse\" in white letters, this is free and can be done several times in the future, however upon dismounting the horse it will return to the stables as it is not owned.\nIf the option to get a cut of the gold made off of him is selected, return to Shadr and tell him there was no way to convince Sapphire to back off. Return to Sapphire and get the gold payoff.\nRewards.\nA leveled reward is only available if the Dragonborn splits the profit with Sapphire instead of helping Shadr."}

Using it absorbs an enemy's health and magicka, and lessens the effect of spells cast on the user. While it shields its user from magical attacks, the staff will eventually abandon its owner before they become too powerful and upset the mystical balance the staff was created to protect.\nHistory.\nSecond Era.\nIn &lt;a href=\"2E%20582\"&gt;2E 582&lt;/a&gt;, during the events of , the staff was in the possession of the &lt;a href=\"Aldmeri%20Dominion%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Aldmeri Dominion&lt;/a&gt;, having been stashed in &lt;a href=\"Marbruk%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Marbruk&lt;/a&gt;.

Attempting to use the staff to corrupt the heart, the shade removed the ancient magical protections that had been previously placed upon the ruin. The &lt;a href=\"Veiled%20Heritance\"&gt;Veiled Heritance&lt;/a&gt; hoped to turn &lt;a href=\"Valenwood%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Valenwood&lt;/a&gt; into a \"&lt;a href=\"Shadow%20Wood\"&gt;Shadow Wood&lt;/a&gt;\". Luckily for Valenwood, however, the Dominion eventually invaded the ruins, killing Naemon. The staff ultimately ended up in the hands of &lt;a href=\"Queen%20Ayrenn%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Queen Ayrenn&lt;/a&gt;.\nThird Era.\nYears later, during the &lt;a href=\"Imperial%20Simulacrum\"&gt;Imperial Simulacrum&lt;/a&gt;, the Staff of Magnus was located by the &lt;a href=\"Eternal%20Champion\"&gt;Eternal Champion&lt;/a&gt;.\nLater into the third era, the staff was obtained by a mage from the &lt;a href=\"Mages%20Guild\"&gt;Mages Guild&lt;/a&gt;, and the &lt;a href=\"Hero%20of%20Daggerfall\"&gt;Hero of Daggerfall&lt;/a&gt; was assigned the task of taking back the staff from the guild.\n&lt;a href=\"Dreveni%20Hlaren\"&gt;Dreveni Hlaren&lt;/a&gt;, a sorceress, was the owner of the staff by &lt;a href=\"3E%20427\"&gt;3E 427&lt;/a&gt;.

The &lt;a href=\"Last%20Dragonborn\"&gt;Last Dragonborn&lt;/a&gt; was sent to Labyrinthian by the &lt;a href=\"College%20of%20Winterhold%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;College of Winterhold&lt;/a&gt;, where they killed the &lt;a href=\"Dragon%20Priest\"&gt;Dragon Priest&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Morokei\"&gt;Morokei&lt;/a&gt; and brought the staff back to the establishment.

The staff consisted of eight segments, each being a semblance of a Tower in its Dance.\nHistory.\nSome time after its creation it was dismantled, and seven of its segments were hidden by White-Gold Knights in distant Fold-Places. The last segment, also known as Segment One, remained with Anumaril.\nAfter the Rebellion Anumaril fled along with other Ayleids to &lt;a href=\"Valenwood\"&gt;Valenwood&lt;/a&gt;. They were welcomed by the &lt;a href=\"Bosmer\"&gt;Green-Sap's Elves&lt;/a&gt; as long as they agreed not to dissonate the greensong and all the Heartland High Elves agreed to this except for Anumaril. He asked the Great &lt;a href=\"Camoran%20Dynasty\"&gt;Camoran&lt;/a&gt; to show him the &lt;a href=\"Green-Sap\"&gt;Green-Sap&lt;/a&gt;. Within the great graht he found his desire\u2014&lt;a href=\"Perchance%20Acorn\"&gt;Perchance Acorn&lt;/a&gt;. He then attempted to convert the region into a new home for the Ayleids by plunging Segment One into the acorn. This resulted in stopping the Elden Tree from moving by turning its perchance acorn into a definite acorn, but it was not enough to convert the tree.\nIn the 6th century of the &lt;a href=\"Second%20Era\"&gt;Second Era&lt;/a&gt; time breaches started to appear across &lt;a href=\"Tamriel\"&gt;Tamriel&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href=\"Loremaster%20Celarus\"&gt;Loremaster Celarus&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Josajeh\"&gt;Josajeh&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"Psijic%20Order\"&gt;Psijic Order&lt;/a&gt; ascertained that the Staff of Towers was the cause for the appearance of breaches. The scryers of the Psijic Order were able to detect the fragments of the staff by studying the collision of tonal waves near the breaches which could be observed with the help of the &lt;a href=\"Vestige\"&gt;Vestige&lt;/a&gt;, who placed the &lt;a href=\"Psijic%20Seals\"&gt;Psijic Seals&lt;/a&gt; in most of the provinces. After the discovery of fragments' location the Vestige collected them, and they formed a staff, as the fragments could not be contained separately because some force kept on drawing them back together. Subsequently, after the staff's assembly, Josajeh stole it to change various events in the past. Her plan was thwarted by the Vestige, who defeated Josajeh from alternative timelines. After that the staff was recovered and placed in the &lt;a href=\"College%20of%20Psijics%20Ruins\"&gt;Vault of Moawita&lt;/a&gt; on &lt;a href=\"Artaeum\"&gt;Artaeum&lt;/a&gt;.\nSegments of the Staff.\nThe eight fragments are located in places of Aurbic importance:"}

It requires the following components:\nUsefulness.\nThe staff can be very useful when looting &lt;a href=\"Dungeons%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;dungeons&lt;/a&gt; without a large &lt;a href=\"Encumbrance%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;carry capacity&lt;/a&gt;. To do this, items can be stored into a weak dead body (plentiful in most dungeons), and then the corpse reanimated. The zombie will them follow the &lt;a href=\"Last%20Dragonborn\"&gt;Dragonborn&lt;/a&gt; anywhere, even &lt;a href=\"Fast%20Travel%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;fast traveling&lt;/a&gt; back to the Dragonborn's home. Once they drop dead again, all the stored items can then be retrieved from the corpse.\nBugs.\n Sometimes, the body won't turn into a pile of ash, allowing the Dragonborn to reuse the body."}

The staff is accompanied by four &lt;a href=\"Everscamp\"&gt;Everscamp&lt;/a&gt;s, which are weaker, passive versions of normal &lt;a href=\"Scamp%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;scamps&lt;/a&gt;.\nIf an Everscamp is killed, a new one will appear shortly to take its place. The staff cannot be dropped or sold, and the staff bearer may only get rid of it by \"giving it to one who is willing to take it\" or returning it to the altar in &lt;a href=\"Darkfathom%20Cave\"&gt;Darkfathom Cave&lt;/a&gt;.\nBackground.\nThe Staff of the Everscamp is a &lt;a href=\"Daedric%20Artifact\"&gt;Daedric Artifact&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"Sheogorath\"&gt;Sheogorath&lt;/a&gt;. Rosentia Gellenus mentions purchasing it from an unnamed traveling merchant, which could have been Sheogorath.\n\"Everscamps\" will continuously spawn around the staff bearer (up to four at a time), and follow. They will not attack other beings without provocation. They are much weaker than conventional scamps, and lack the fire attack. Each will respawn approximately ten seconds after death.\nDespite being an Artifact of Sheogorath, the staff cannot be given to &lt;a href=\"Martin%20Septim%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;Martin Septim&lt;/a&gt; as a Daedric Artifact as part of the main questline.\nSkill leveling.\nAlthough the Everscamps spawn somewhat slowly for the purposes of attack training, and aren't much use as a personal army, they could be considered a quick and safe way to &lt;a href=\"Skill%20Leveling%20Tips%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;increase defensive skills&lt;/a&gt;. Even the entire group together can do little damage compared to many other foes, and when they respawn, they will no longer fight back unless they are attacked again.\nUsefulness.\nWhile the Everscamps are normally passive, the Hero may compel them to fight on his/her behalf by using an area Command Creature spell. Due to their low level, the magnitude of the spell does not need to be very high. Also, their stats may be improved with any targeted or touch range buff spell.\nThey may also be used to feed\u00a0&lt;a href=\"Dawnfang/Duskfang\"&gt;Dawnfang/Duskfang&lt;/a&gt;.\nQuests.\n&lt;a href=\"Whom%20Gods%20Annoy\"&gt;Whom Gods Annoy&lt;/a&gt;.\nPeople in &lt;a href=\"Leyawiin%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;Leyawiin&lt;/a&gt; report strange noises and smells coming from &lt;a href=\"Rosentia%20Gallenus%27s%20House\"&gt;Rosentia Gallenus's House&lt;/a&gt;.

The deceased would be encased in the material as a form of protection, a privilege that was typically reserved for Nordic individuals. It was also believed to have been used to craft armor for ancient kings that fought in battle.

Mining a deposit takes twice as long as mining other ore deposits, six hits with a pickaxe per ore. Deposits typically replenish after thirty to thirty-five days, much like other ores.\nThe following is a list of locations where Stalhrim can be mined:\nIn addition, &lt;a href=\"Baldor%20Iron-Shaper\"&gt;Baldor Iron-Shaper&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"Glover%20Mallory\"&gt;Glover Mallory&lt;/a&gt; will sometimes have a small amount of Stalhrim for sale once \"A New Source of Stalhrim\" is completed.

They are believed to be &lt;a href=\"Aetherius\"&gt;Aetherial&lt;/a&gt; artifacts.\nHistory.\nWhen the Star Teeth made their way to the &lt;a href=\"Mundus\"&gt;Mundus&lt;/a&gt;, it was said they looked like shooting stars\u2014 Aetherial fragments making their descent from Aetherius.\nThe Star Teeth are said to be collected from the sky using &lt;a href=\"airships\"&gt;airships&lt;/a&gt;, the exact date of their discovery is unknown. Initially the airships were able to obtain seven Star Teeth. During the &lt;a href=\"War%20of%20Bend%27r-Mahk\"&gt;War of Bend'r-Mahk&lt;/a&gt;, the Star Teeth could be found all over the provinces of &lt;a href=\"High%20Rock\"&gt;High Rock&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Hammerfell\"&gt;Hammerfell&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Skyrim\"&gt;Skyrim&lt;/a&gt;, in the possession of various people. By the &lt;a href=\"3E%20397\"&gt;3E 397&lt;/a&gt;, only the location of five were known.\nThe Star Teeth were eventually collected by the &lt;a href=\"Hero%20of%20Azra%27s%20Crossing\"&gt;Hero of Azra's Crossing&lt;/a&gt; and used to destroy the &lt;a href=\"Umbra%27%20Keth\"&gt;Umbra' Keth&lt;/a&gt;, by placing them on pedestals in the &lt;a href=\"Vault%20of%20the%20Heavens\"&gt;Vault of the Heavens&lt;/a&gt;."}
{"id": "875498", "revid": "7075644", "url": "https://elderscrolls.fandom.com/wiki?curid=875498", "title": "Star Teeth, Volume I", "text": "Star Teeth, Volume I is a &lt;a href=\"Books%20%28Online%29\"&gt;book&lt;/a&gt; in .\nContents.\nStar Teeth, Volume I: The &lt;a href=\"Welkynd%20Stone%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Welkynd Stone&lt;/a&gt;'s Incompetent Cousin, or Something More?\nI have had the opportunity to conduct research on the seven Star Teeth, artifacts that are held in high import by the Ayleids of old (or so several dusty tomes tell us), here at the &lt;a href=\"Agea%20Relle\"&gt;Agea Relle&lt;/a&gt;. We discovered these curious prisms in the very caverns from which the foundation of the school was built. &lt;a href=\"Rulanir\"&gt;Rulanir&lt;/a&gt; and I found them on pedestals, arranged in a staggered pattern that made the array of crystals appear, ironically, as a row of teeth.\nI handled them with tacit care (to not do so with such potent relics would be foolish), but I gleaned much from my experimentation. To put it simplest, the &lt;a href=\"Star%20Teeth\"&gt;Star Teeth&lt;/a&gt; are magical stones with the capability to emit light; I have witnessed them casting all manner of it, of many colors and intensities. The Teeth appear to be structurally similar to crystals like the &lt;a href=\"Welkynd%20Stone%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Welkynd Stones&lt;/a&gt;, but apparently without the capability to store magicka. There is a different power emanating from them, though I have yet to discover their intended use.\nHowever, as with all magic, I believe there is a way to weaponize this light as a defense against certain types of shades and even varieties of &lt;a href=\"Daedra%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Daedra&lt;/a&gt;. I cannot control the Teeth, and the sporadic light that pours from them comes seemingly at random\u2014but, using an unspent Welkynd Stone as a base, I hope to construct an emulation that will obey magical commands. If experimentation goes well, by year's end, every student of the &lt;a href=\"Agea%20Relle\"&gt;Agea Relle&lt;/a&gt; wandering the depths of &lt;a href=\"Rivenspire\"&gt;Rivenspire&lt;/a&gt; will have a prototype prism for defense against the &lt;a href=\"Vampire%20%28Online%29\"&gt;vampiric&lt;/a&gt;, the spectral, and possibly the corporeally animate. If the endeavor goes poorly, perhaps the stones can serve as reusable torches\u2014barring that, paperweights.\nThere is much work to do before then, though, as the Teeth seem to spark far less often in the night, without nearby light sources, and no one is sure why. Even during the day the Teeth are less active in the shade. It is odd to say, but the phrase stuck in my mind when a young student of mine commented that the Teeth seemed to be afraid of the dark.\nFurther examination is clearly necessary. At best, it will allow the Agea Relle to produce a piece of equipment that will help all adventurers, not just our students, in the caves and abandoned castles of &lt;a href=\"Tamriel\"&gt;Tamriel&lt;/a&gt;. At worst, the school will get to publish a piece, this paper being the first part, on a collection of Ayleid relics no one in the modern world has had a chance to study.\nIt is not my intent to write this paper for circulation amongst the &lt;a href=\"Mages%20Guild%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Mages Guild&lt;/a&gt; chapters, though if our Star Teeth simulacrum bears fruit, I'm certain it, and any related journals, will find their way to those academic masses. If this is the case, and you, dear reader, belong to the Mages Guild, put this paper down and step outside. Go on an adventure or two\u2014hunt a &lt;a href=\"wamasu%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Wamasu&lt;/a&gt;. Magic is helpful, beautiful, and should be utilized, shared. Not trapped on the highest floor of a dusty tower where no one but yourself and the Daedra you summon can see it.\nTo &lt;a href=\"Faindor\"&gt;Faindor&lt;/a&gt;: Obviously, don't transcribe this note into the journal (you think you're funny\u2014it's tragic). &lt;a href=\"Nerien%27eth\"&gt;Nerien'eth&lt;/a&gt; may have time to review this introduction and provide further context\u2014he's had a chance to analyze the Teeth before his recent trip across the continent, so bring this to his attention once he has finished cataloguing the artifacts he found out there. His letters mentioned an ancient weapon\u2014a sword of some kind. He thinks it may be &lt;a href=\"Akaviri\"&gt;Akaviri&lt;/a&gt;. You're always reading about the Akaviri, aren't you? Finish this before the dormitory serves supper and I shall make certain you get a chance to see it."}

{"id": "18501", "revid": "32045548", "url": "https://elderscrolls.fandom.com/wiki?curid=18501", "title": "Starter guide", "text": "Character creation.\n offers much flexibility in character creation. You can greatly modify your character's appearance, &lt;a href=\"Races%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;race&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Birthsigns%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;birthsign&lt;/a&gt;, and class. Your appearance can be whatever you like. However, your race affects how well you will do with certain skills and abilities. For example, if you choose a &lt;a href=\"Bretons%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;Breton&lt;/a&gt;, you will have an initial &lt;a href=\"Magicka%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;magicka&lt;/a&gt; of 150 points, unlike the initial magicka of the &lt;a href=\"Imperials%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;Imperial&lt;/a&gt; race, which only starts with 80 magicka points; if you chose the race of &lt;a href=\"Argonians%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;Argonian&lt;/a&gt; you are able to breathe under water. Typically warriors and soldiers are &lt;a href=\"Orsimer%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;Orcs&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Nords%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;Nords&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Redguards%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;Redguards&lt;/a&gt; or Imperials. Most mages are &lt;a href=\"Altmer%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;Altmer&lt;/a&gt; or Bretons. Many &lt;a href=\"Thief%20%28Class%29\"&gt;thieves&lt;/a&gt; will be &lt;a href=\"Bosmer%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;Bosmer&lt;/a&gt;, Argonians or &lt;a href=\"Khajiit%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;Khajiits&lt;/a&gt;. Any race can be adapted to any role or job.\nClass and Skills.\nWhen you reach the point where Emperor &lt;a href=\"Uriel%20Septim%20VII\"&gt;Uriel Septim&lt;/a&gt; is assassinated, one of his &lt;a href=\"Blades%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;Blades&lt;/a&gt; members will talk to you and he will estimate what type of class would suit your playing style best, based on your performance up until that point. You can go according to what the soldier says, or you can choose one of the other &lt;a href=\"Classes%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;pre-made classes&lt;/a&gt; or make a custom one of your own. Be careful! Make sure that you choose the class that you will be happy using the whole game. For example, if you choose to be a mage, but you use a sword and keep leveling up your blade skills, it will not make you level up as a whole. Customize your class to fit the skills you would like to use. See the pre-made classes above if you want an effective build, or are playing for the first time, as it can be quite difficult to get the overall effect you want. If you can't get the overall effect you wanted, you may as well delete your current one and make a new, better one (just hope you did not get too far in the game; anywhere before level 10 and/or before you get to &lt;a href=\"Kvatch%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;Kvatch&lt;/a&gt; during the &lt;a href=\"Main%20Quest%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;main quest&lt;/a&gt;).\nAt the end of the sewers, you will get a final chance to change your appearance, race, class, and birthsign. After you confirm your choices or make any changes, you will be deposited outside the walls of the &lt;a href=\"Imperial%20City%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;Imperial City&lt;/a&gt;.\nOnce you are out of the sewers, you could either go straight to your main quests or do other quests. It is recommended that you join a guild or &lt;a href=\"Factions%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;faction&lt;/a&gt;.\nLeveling your character.\nThere are several ways you can level your stats. See &lt;a href=\"Skill%20Leveling%20Tips%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;skill leveling tips&lt;/a&gt; for more info on how to efficiently level up skills. In the start of the game, before Uriel Septim is assassinated all your skills are counted as major skills, so it is easy to level every thing up, before choosing your major skills after the emperor is dead. Once you have chosen your class try to level up Combat skills at the same rate as non-combat skills, if you only level up your non-combat skills, the game can start to get very hard very quickly.\nGetting items.\nWhile still in the dungeon, check out the dead bodies (if there are any) and take their items. Once you exit the sewers you will see a lake; going across this lake will bring you to a small bandit camp. Looting the camp and the corpses is profitable. There is also a book which increases your Hand to Hand skill next to a bedroll. Searching the area near the camp will reveal a chest and a jewelry box, located next to a small boat. The camp is right next to the ruin &lt;a href=\"Vilverin\"&gt;Vilverin&lt;/a&gt;, which is also occupied by Bandits (for the first half of the dungeon). To the left, at the edge of the water, is a little dock similar to the one in front of the sewers. There is a jewelry box inside an open crate, and a barrel.\nCombat.\nCombat in is rather easy. However, you must still remember a few things before going to direct combat with hard enemies.\nMarksman.\nCharacters who use &lt;a href=\"Marksman%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;Marksman&lt;/a&gt; (bows and arrows) as their main attack method follow a slightly different routine. For Marksman characters, the aim is to keep the enemy at arm's distance while turning them into pincushions from afar.\nDistance.\nAlways stay out of reach of the enemy's weaponry. Remember that while the enemy cannot hit you, you have the advantage, but once they close to melee range, the advantage is theirs.\nAgility.\nMost marksmen are stealth-based characters, generally granting them skill in athletics and acrobatics. Let speed be your shield: not being there when the enemy's blow lands is more sure a defense than any amount of Daedric armor. When engaged, you can run, roll and jump out of harms way, often getting access to locations the enemy cannot dream of reaching.\nArrows.\nUnlike melee combat, Marksman requires expendable ammunition: arrows. Should you run out, you are suddenly unable to attack. Always ensure you have more arrows than you could ever dream to use (say, 100\u2013200 depending on quality), and never forsake the humble iron arrow. They are quite cheap, relatively easy to find and it's no big loss if you either miss or lose the arrow in an enemy.\ufeff\nMagic.\nMagic consists mostly of all the spells and scrolls in the game.\nIn this game, you can also make your own spells. First, you will need to join the &lt;a href=\"Mages%20Guild%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;Mages Guild&lt;/a&gt; and get the Apprentice rank. You will need to complete a series of &lt;a href=\"Join%20the%20Mages%20Guild\"&gt;recommendation quests&lt;/a&gt; for guildhalls in every city, except Kvatch, before having access to the &lt;a href=\"Praxographical%20Center\"&gt;Praxographical Center&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;a href=\"Arcane%20University%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;Arcane University&lt;/a&gt;, which is located southeast of the &lt;a href=\"Imperial%20City%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;Imperial City&lt;/a&gt;. This is the place where you can make your own magic for the cost of your gold. If you want more info on making spells, see &lt;a href=\"Spellmaking%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;Spellmaking&lt;/a&gt;. Keep in mind that spell crafting often costs a lot more than simply buying a spell.\nNot only can you make your own magic in this game, but you can also make your own magical/enchanted &lt;a href=\"Weapons%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;weapons&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Armor%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;armor&lt;/a&gt;. The &lt;a href=\"Altar%20of%20Enchanting\"&gt;Altar of Enchanting&lt;/a&gt; is located at the &lt;a href=\"Chironasium\"&gt;Chironasium&lt;/a&gt;. If you want to make your own enchanted gear, you will need some gold (of course), an unenchanted wearable item which you want to put new effects on, and a &lt;a href=\"Soul%20Gem%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;soul gem&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"Azura%27s%20Star%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;Azura's Star&lt;/a&gt; with a soul in it. The level of the soul gem will decide how much charge your weapon is going to have. For more information on how to make enchanted weapons, see &lt;a href=\"Enchanting%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;Enchanting&lt;/a&gt;.\nSneaking.\nThings one can do while &lt;a href=\"Sneak%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;sneaking&lt;/a&gt;:\nUndetected movement.\nThere are many elements that contribute to your detection: the light around you (e.g. whether you are standing near or holding a lit &lt;a href=\"Torch%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;torch&lt;/a&gt;), your speed, the surrounding environment, and most importantly, the level of your &lt;a href=\"Sneak%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;Sneak&lt;/a&gt; skill. Although not being seen is certainly the best way to avoid being detected, NPCs can still hear you moving - even though you may be in another room and are sneaking, a low sneak skill will make you easier to detect. Also, you can use the shadows of trees and buildings to hide you.\nThe best way to move around undetected without taking in consideration of these three elements is being &lt;a href=\"Invisibility%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;invisible&lt;/a&gt;. When you are invisible, you cannot be detected. Whether you have a light spell around you or even running and not sneaking, you cannot be detected by another person. However, invisibility is dispelled as soon as any non-passive action is made, e.g. activating items/doors/chests, hitting someone or readying a spell.\nAlso having a &lt;a href=\"Chameleon%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;Chameleon&lt;/a&gt; item is a great way to go undetected. If your Chameleon points are 100% or above, you won't be seen by any NPC even if you run or attack them.\nPickpocketing and stealing.\nSimply put, go into sneak mode, sneak towards an NPC, and then steal their items. However, sneaking is a bit more complicated than that.\nAnother method is to use an Invisibility spell or &lt;a href=\"Scrolls%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;scroll&lt;/a&gt;. However, even though you are invisible, you still need to take caution. After you steal from a person, your invisible state ends. If you have a Chameleon percentage above 100% you can usually steal without being detected.\nStealing is straightforward. As long as you are not seen while in stealth mode when taking an object, the object is yours to keep and nobody will know it.\nIt is also possible to use a command humanoid spell to lead the person to a dark secluded area. If you do not kill the person in two hits recast the spell and keep trying. You could also repeatedly cast a command humanoid spell on an NPC effectively lowering their disposition every time the spell wears off (easier on NPCs with high aggression).\nSneak damage.\nLet's continue on with sneak damage. You can do a sneak damage by sneaking on another person and then attacking them. Sneak damage greatly increases the strike that you did to that enemy.\nAt early levels in Sneak you will get a 2x damage bonus when attacking with a bow while undetected, and a 4x bonus when attacking with one handed melee weapons. Later, after some practice, this increases to 3x and 6x respectively. You will get a text message (default location is the top left of the screen) telling you the damage multiplier. If you attempt to sneak attack with a two handed melee weapon, you deal no extra damage.\nBuying a House.\nAfter some time, once you have acquired 2,000 , it is recommended to buy a house for storage and a place to rest. Head to the Market District of the Imperial City and go to the &lt;a href=\"Office%20of%20Imperial%20Commerce\"&gt;Office of Imperial Commerce&lt;/a&gt;. Talk to the lady in the counter and speak to her about buying a house. If she does not like you enough, you will probably spend about 100 gold bribing her to raise your disposition with her, so that you can buy the house. She is going to say that she has an available house that is located at the &lt;a href=\"Imperial%20City%20Waterfront\"&gt;Imperial City Waterfront&lt;/a&gt;. Even though this house is small and rugged, this is the perfect place to store your items and sleep. Also, since it is located in the Imperial City, the center of the country, it\u2019s the most accessible house you can use. After you get this house, go to &lt;a href=\"Three%20Brothers%20Trade%20Goods\"&gt;Three Brothers Trade Goods&lt;/a&gt; and buy the furnishings.\n&lt;a href=\"Benirus%20Manor\"&gt;Benirus Manor&lt;/a&gt;, located in &lt;a href=\"Anvil%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;Anvil&lt;/a&gt;, is the cheapest manor house as its cost is only 5,000 gold, but requires the completion of the \"&lt;a href=\"Where%20Spirits%20Have%20Lease\"&gt;Where Spirits Have Lease&lt;/a&gt;\" quest before it can be considered a functional house (unless you like the 'decayed grandeur' look and don't mind a few ghosts as tenants). It is also the only house that does not require separately bought furnishings and decoration. This house is probably the cheapest house and the best deal, with all things considered.\nAll other houses are more expensive, such as the one in Skingrad (a veritable mansion), which costs 48,200 gold. However, there are two side quests that can be completed once it has been upgraded.\n\"Note: the &lt;a href=\"Waterfront\"&gt;Waterfront&lt;/a&gt; shack may not be the cheapest since it does have to be decorated and the final cost is dependent on your &lt;a href=\"Mercantile%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;Mercantile&lt;/a&gt; skill. All houses have beds 'in the bundle' prior to buying the furnishings/decorations.\"\nTraveling.\nThere are many ways to Travel around the world of &lt;a href=\"Tamriel\"&gt;Tamriel&lt;/a&gt;, and you should familiarize yourself with them as soon as possible. Fast travel is the way to go at first as its an easy way to get to all the major cities. Walking is another great way to travel when you first start as you will uncover many locations along the way that you can come back to for fast travel checkpoints or dungeon crawling. It is advised that you get a horse as soon as possible as they are faster than walking/running, and allow for the discovery of more new locations because of this increase in speed. You can either follow the main quest for the first mission \"&lt;a href=\"Deliver%20the%20Amulet\"&gt;Deliver the Amulet&lt;/a&gt;\" where you will receive a paint horse from one of &lt;a href=\"Jauffre%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;Jauffre's&lt;/a&gt; fellow monks (Prior Maborel). This horse is of the slowest and weakest breed, but better than nothing. Alternatively you can purchase one at any stable if you have a lot of spare gold. You can also get &lt;a href=\"Shadowmere%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;Shadowmere&lt;/a&gt;, a horse that will fight for you and is relatively quick, while doing the Dark Brotherhood questline. Shadowmere is invincible so it cannot die. It can also be used as a storage. If you knock it out you can loot it's body and put things in then knock it out again to take it out."}

Clavicus has always been a little blind to that. And it'll end badly this time, too. So, just leave things be. Walk away. It's your best bet, really.\"\n\"This is your out, friend. Leave it alone. How about we just march on back to the shrine and tell Clavicus the deal is off? Sure, he'll be a bit put off, but you won't be dead. At least, you probably won't. That's better odds than you're getting here.\"\n\"I'm telling you: don't bring that sword back to Clavicus. It'll ruin him. I'm sure. I mean, not completely: He's still a Daedra Prince and all that. Look, keep the sword if you want. That's your decision. But don't give it back to Clavicus. He doesn't know what's good for him sometimes.\"\n\"Good move, kid. Some things are better left alone. Let's get back to the Shrine. I'll smooth things over with the big guy. I'm sure he'll understand.\"\n\"Oh, well. Been good knowing you, kid. Back to being His Hound for me.

Before the date, Goval asks the Nerevarine for tips for the meeting. The chances of a positive outcome of the date depends on the tip given. They are as follows:\nTwo days later, the two can be encountered during their date in front of the Winged Guard in Godsreach. If the date went well, Goval will give to the Nerevarine the &lt;a href=\"Ralen%20Family%20Belt\"&gt;Ralen Family Belt&lt;/a&gt; as a reward once he is back at his original location.\nSunel Hlas.\nSunel Hlas can be found in &lt;a href=\"Trader%20%28Tribunal%29\"&gt;his shop&lt;/a&gt; in the Great Bazaar.

The chances of a positive outcome of the date depends on the tip given. They are as follows:\nAround three days later, after the date, both characters are back to their original location.

The creature struck without warning and killed everyone it could. &lt;a href=\"Svenja%20Snow-Song\"&gt;Svenja Snow-Song&lt;/a&gt; was able to drive the beast away with her arrows, but fears that it will return, and asks the &lt;a href=\"Nerevarine\"&gt;Nerevarine&lt;/a&gt; to slay it.\nWalkthrough.\nAttack on the Mead Hall.\nAt some point during or after the quest \"The Skaal Test of Strength\", the Nerevarine may come upon the mead hall of Thirsk near the eastern shore of Lake Fjalding, south of &lt;a href=\"Skaal%20Village%20%28Bloodmoon%29\"&gt;Skaal Village&lt;/a&gt;. If they enter, they will find a scene of utter carnage, with all of the patrons dead, except for a sole survivor named Svenja Snow-Song. Upon talking to Svenja, she will tell the Nerevarine of a monster called Udyrfrykte that came and attacked the mead hall without warning. She implores the Nerevarine to find the monster and slay it, as she worries it will return.\nPaws of the Wolf Runner.\nThe Nerevarine should take the time to loot the bodies in Thirsk before heading out. The unique boots, &lt;a href=\"Paws%20of%20the%20Wolf-Runner\"&gt;Paws of the Wolf-Runner&lt;/a&gt;, can be found on the body of Thirsk's chieftain &lt;a href=\"Skjoldr%20Wolf-Runner\"&gt;Skjoldr Wolf-Runner&lt;/a&gt;. This will be the only chance to acquire these boots, as the bodies will disappear once Thirsk is repaired.\nSlay the Monster.\nThe Udyrfrykte can be found in its lair, a small ice cave on the eastern shore of Lake Fjalding just west of Thirsk. Inside the cave the Nerevarine will find the hideous green eyed, fanged &lt;a href=\"Trolls\"&gt;troll&lt;/a&gt;-like monster wielding a &lt;a href=\"Severed%20Nord%20Leg\"&gt;severed leg&lt;/a&gt; as a weapon, presumably from one of the unfortunate patrons of Thirsk. The Udyrfrykte is not the toughest opponent encountered, but the Nerevarine will need to be cautious, as it is still quite powerful. Once the Udyrfrykte is slain, retrieve its heart to show as a proof that it will never threaten Thirsk again. The Nerevarine can also loot the Udyrfrykte's corpse for the severed leg to use as a rather unique &lt;a href=\"Handedness%20%28Morrowind%29\"&gt;one-handed&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Blunt%20Weapon%20%28Morrowind%29\"&gt;blunt&lt;/a&gt; weapon.\nReturn to Thirsk.\nUpon returning to Thirsk the Nerevarine will find the place boarded up and Svenja standing outside. When engaging in conversation with her, she will take the heart of the Udyrfrykte, then ask the Nerevarine perform another task. She will ask them to go to the tomb of Thirsk's founder, Hrothmund the Red, and place their hands upon the legendary axe found within. Svenja will then mention that she will begin repairs on Thirsk while the they are away.\nBlessing from Hrothmund.\nHrothmund's Barrow is located in &lt;a href=\"Hrothmund%27s%20Bane\"&gt;Hrothmund's Bane&lt;/a&gt;, a large stone dolmen far to the northwest of thirsk in the &lt;a href=\"Moesring%20Mountains\"&gt;Moesring Mountains&lt;/a&gt;, south of &lt;a href=\"Castle%20Karstaag\"&gt;Castle Karstaag&lt;/a&gt;. Hrothmund's Bane will look like the outline a wolf on the local map. The entrance to the Barrow can be found in the \"eye\" of the wolf. Once at the barrow the Nerevarine must speak the name of the beast that killed Hrothmund in order to gain entry. If they talked to &lt;a href=\"Louis%20Beauchamp\"&gt;Louis Beauchamp&lt;/a&gt; at the &lt;a href=\"Ald%27ruhn%20Mages%20Guild\"&gt;Ald'ruhn Mages Guild&lt;/a&gt; during the quest \"&lt;a href=\"The%20Patchwork%20Airship%20%28Quest%29\"&gt;The Patchwork Airship&lt;/a&gt;\", they would know that the code word is \"Ondjage\". Once inside the barrow, the Nerevarine will face opposition from a &lt;a href=\"Draugr%20%28Bloodmoon%29\"&gt;draugr&lt;/a&gt; and a &lt;a href=\"bonewolf\"&gt;bonewolf&lt;/a&gt;, and must slay them. Upon approaching the axe of Hrothmund they will discover that it is lodged in a stone, and can not be picked up. However they can interact with the axe to commune with the spirit of Hrothmund, and utter their intention to rule Thirsk and its people. If Hrothmound's spirit approves, the Nerevarine will receive a blessing that will grant 5 points &lt;a href=\"Sanctuary%20%28Morrowind%29\"&gt;Sanctuary&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Frost%20Shield%20%28Morrowind%29\"&gt;Frost Shield&lt;/a&gt;.\nChief of Thirsk.\nWhen the Nerevarine returns, the mead hall will have been repaired, and they will be named the new Chief of Thirsk. In the quarters upstairs they will find a gift from Svenja Snow-Song, Clanbringer; a blade with magical effects. If they take the time to visit &lt;a href=\"Bereditte%20Jastal\"&gt;Bereditte Jastal&lt;/a&gt;, they will receive a copy of \"&lt;a href=\"Thirsk%2C%20a%20History%20--%20Revised\"&gt;Thirsk, a History -- Revised&lt;/a&gt;\", which will include a section about the new chieftain."}

So easily overwritten by emotion and prejudice. I cannot think of a more unregulated recording of events, which is why I commit my thoughts into the unchanging metal of my sequence plaques. But even the most objective view can still hold bias, and words can only convey so much. The engravings on this plaque pale to the complexity of a simple human thought, with all the nuances and richness that even a common mind can hold.\nLord &lt;a href=\"Seht\"&gt;Seht&lt;/a&gt; knows this. After all, his heart drives the Wheels Eternal, oiled and calibrated. This we know. To become that which is the only true name, which is not Name, one's mind must be polished. Synchronized. How to accomplish such a task? Even a god may become overburdened with the weight of emotions, fractured from the whole which is logic.\nBut in this too the Clockwork God was wise. He gave his memories form, manifestation. Glowing stars to make up the galaxy of his thoughts. Tangible and real, far more real than ink upon parchment, than words or whispers. Whole and perfect, and only able to be so from the strength of his divinity, his gleaming and peerless mind which holds the true order of all.\nMemories are flawed, yes, but they are precious all the same. They hold our wisdom and knowledge, all that which we are. To give them away would be squandering that gift, and this too Lord Seht knew. So he preserved these precious thoughts, locked safely with his Mnemonic Planisphere. Watched over by the ever-silent Astronomer. A multitude of stars which no longer held emotional sway over him, no, but still remained connected, known.\nIt's quiet in the Planisphere, but one hears whispers. A low hum of voices seem to echo within the halls. Those figures of the past, lost but not forgotten. Come to light once more."}

Trap doors leading to The Midden can be found just north of the door to the &lt;a href=\"Hall%20of%20the%20Elements\"&gt;Hall of the Elements&lt;/a&gt; in the College's courtyard, and under the stairs in the &lt;a href=\"Hall%20of%20Countenance\"&gt;Hall of Countenance&lt;/a&gt;.\nSublocations.\nThe Midden.\nWhichever way the Midden is entered, there will be a room with four openings on a wall (in a two by two arrangement). The bottom right opening is clear, while the others are barred with iron grates. However, the opening leads to a long drop to a room with a waterfall that can be reached in another way.\nTo the northeast is a passage that leads to a split. The right side (which leads to the east) leads to a single empty jail cell. The left (north) passage leads to a snow-covered room that joins on to a room with a low ceiling with many pillars with two exits. An exit path to the east/northeast leads to a large room with an attached room straight across to the southeast that contains the &lt;a href=\"Atronach%20Forge\"&gt;Atronach Forge&lt;/a&gt;. A passageway to the southwest leads to a cell door, with a room beyond that has a bench containing some &lt;a href=\"Alchemy%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;alchemy&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Ingredients%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;ingredients&lt;/a&gt;.\nFurther southwest is the floor of the waterfall room seen before. The stairs on the left side lead to a ledge with nothing but a Draugr. Instead, continuing along the path under the ledge to the southwest leads to The Midden Dark.\nThe Midden Dark.\nUpon entering, after walking across a short passageway, there is an ice cave with a bridge across it. After crossing the bridge, a path to the left (still inside the ice cave) leads down to a ledge with a &lt;a href=\"Containers%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;chest&lt;/a&gt; with some gold in it. Returning to the bridge level from the ledge is possible (by jumping on top of the chest, then hugging the wall to the left and jumping while moving forward). However, upon dropping further down into the depths of the cave from the ledge, it will be impossible to climb back up. However, proceeding through the cavern as described below will eventually lead back to the bridge.\nAt the bottom of the cave, one passage leads west that eventually leads outside. Another passage leads east to what appear to be sewers. In the first room (one with columns spread throughout) are a skeleton, the corpses of &lt;a href=\"Frostbite%20Spider%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Frostbite Spiders&lt;/a&gt;, and some low-level &lt;a href=\"weapons%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;weapons&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"armor%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;armor&lt;/a&gt;. Against the north wall of the room is a passage to the east that is blocked by spider webs that can be cut with a blade. The passage turns to the north northwest and leads to another ice cave, where steps lead up to what appears to be the remains of someone attempting to cook.\nFurther up the steps is a circular room with a table to the left that has a copy of the \"&lt;a href=\"Midden%20Incident%20Report\"&gt;Midden Incident Report&lt;/a&gt;\" and an Investigator's Key. The report speaks of a group of students who were killed while attempting a summoning ritual, and a strange sculpture from which four rings were pried (which are now supposedly stored in &lt;a href=\"The%20Arcanaeum\"&gt;The Arcanaeum&lt;/a&gt;). To the south southwest is an alcove with &lt;a href=\"Ingredients%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;ingredients&lt;/a&gt;. In the center of the room is a sculpture of a hand for the quest \"&lt;a href=\"Forgotten%20Names\"&gt;Forgotten Names&lt;/a&gt;\".\nUp a set of steps to the northwest is a door that leads to a room with a pit containing a large number of skeletons and two &lt;a href=\"Draugr%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Draugr&lt;/a&gt;. Up a short set of steps is an &lt;a href=\"Alchemy%20Lab%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;alchemy lab&lt;/a&gt;, with the &lt;a href=\"Alchemy%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;alchemy&lt;/a&gt; the skill book \"&lt;a href=\"De%20Rerum%20Dirennis\"&gt;De Rerum Dirennis&lt;/a&gt;\" is on the left side.\nFrom there, the path leads up stairs to the south, then it leads down another set of stairs to another ice cave. This has passages to the west northwest and southeast. The southeast passage leads back to the first ice cave encountered in this cavern. The other leads to stairs down to a locked door, where the &lt;a href=\"Augur%20of%20Dunlain\"&gt;Augur of Dunlain&lt;/a&gt; can be found.\nQuests.\n&lt;a href=\"Forgotten%20Names\"&gt;Forgotten Names&lt;/a&gt;.\nSummon the &lt;a href=\"Velehk%20Sain\"&gt;Dremora Pirate&lt;/a&gt;.\n&lt;a href=\"Good%20Intentions\"&gt;Good Intentions&lt;/a&gt;.\nConsult with the Augur of Dunlain about the &lt;a href=\"Eye%20of%20Magnus\"&gt;Eye of Magnus&lt;/a&gt;.\n&lt;a href=\"Illusion%20Ritual%20Spell\"&gt;Illusion Ritual Spell&lt;/a&gt;.\nFind 4 \"&lt;a href=\"Master%20Illusion%20Text\"&gt;Master Illusion Text&lt;/a&gt;s\" for &lt;a href=\"Drevis%20Neloren\"&gt;Drevis Neloren&lt;/a&gt;.\n&lt;a href=\"Restoration%20Ritual%20Spell\"&gt;Restoration Ritual Spell&lt;/a&gt;.\n&lt;a href=\"Colette%20Marence\"&gt;Colette Marence&lt;/a&gt; sends the &lt;a href=\"Last%20Dragonborn\"&gt;Dragonborn&lt;/a&gt; to the Augur of Dunlain to learn more about &lt;a href=\"Restoration%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Restoration&lt;/a&gt; magic."}

A spectral image appeared before me, a woman named Oriandra. She says she wants to help me get out of this place.\"\nWalkthrough.\nYou will begin the quest facing a doorway in what seems to be the &lt;a href=\"Eldbur%20Sanctuary\"&gt;Eldbur Sanctuary&lt;/a&gt;. Within it, a ghostly character named &lt;a href=\"Oriandra\"&gt;Oriandra&lt;/a&gt; will begin speaking to you. She will say, \"Can you hear me? My name is Oriandra. I'll help you get out of this place. You aren't frozen. You just think you are. You can move. You just need to remember how.\" Walk directly forward into the next room, toward the statue, and Oriandra will say, \"Now remember your strength. Your power. Take a weapon. Feel the weight in your hand.\"\nPick up the &lt;a href=\"Forgotten%20Adventurer%27s%20Sword\"&gt;Forgotten Adventurer's Sword&lt;/a&gt;, open your inventory, and equip the blade (it may display as \"Forgotten Adventurer's Greatsword\"). Then, turn to your left and go through the doorway ahead. Oriandra will say, \"Now go. Beyond the door. You need to see for yourself before I tell you more.\"\nThe door will disintegrate, revealing a crumbling walkway veering to the left and a ghostly outline of the &lt;a href=\"Ceporah%20Tower%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Ceporah Tower&lt;/a&gt; in the distance. Exiting the ruin will blur the edges of your field of view in a dreamlike manner; if you look up, you will also see that the sky is filled with large, pulsating structures resembling neurons.\nFollow the path downward until it widens; Oriandra will be waiting there for you. Around this area, you may also find several pieces of armor. Equip them to gain a defensive bonus in combat. Oriandra will go on to explain your situation:\n\"\"You've been imprisoned in this mind trap by an entity called &lt;a href=\"K%27Tora\"&gt;K'Tora&lt;/a&gt;. Its magic is powerful, but you're stronger than you know. It may appear beautiful, but it's an illusion. A trap designed to control you. K'Tora won't tolerate your resistance much longer.\"\"\nImmediately after, K'Tora's voice will echo all throughout, saying, \"There is no escape. I will break you in time. Watch as I turn your own memories against you!,\" to which Oriandra will shout, \"Defend yourself! In the mind trap, memories can kill you!\" A humanoid &lt;a href=\"Warrior%20%28Summerset%29\"&gt;warrior&lt;/a&gt; wielding two swords will appear farther down the path. Approach it, and it will become hostile; attack it with your greatsword, and it will die quickly.\nHowever, another warrior will appear, this time wielding a greatsword. Oriandra will say, \"Another one! Defend yourself and strike back!\" Press the block button to stop the warrior's attack from injuring you, and press and hold the attack button to launch a \"heavy attack\" of your own. Finally, a third warrior holding a staff will appear, at which point Oriandra will say, \"A magic-user! Interrupt the spell and retaliate!\" Press the attack and block buttons simultaneously to interrupt the warrior's attack, and then fight back with a heavy attack of your own.\nAfter defeating all of the enemy warriors, Oriandra will congratulate you and tell you what your next move is. Follow her further down the path to the ledge, and listen to what she has to say:\n\"Well done! With every memory that returns, your resistance grows stronger. Now follow me! I can't go any farther in this form. If K'Tora notices me, we'll both be lost. You need to reach the tower to escape the mind trap. I can't go with you, but I'll send messages to guide you. Just believe in yourself and you can do this. You simply need to jump.\"\nJump off of the cliff into the lake below. K'Tora's booming voice will say, \"You can't escape my mind trap! I'll destroy you with your darkest fears!\" Swim to the shore, where you will be greeted by one of several generic enemies, including &lt;a href=\"Dessicated%20Archer\"&gt;Dessicated Archer&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"Dessicated%20Fire%20Mage\"&gt;Dessicated Fire Mage&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"Dessicated%20Warrior\"&gt;Dessicated Warrior&lt;/a&gt;s, and &lt;a href=\"Yaghra%20Larva\"&gt;Yaghra Larva&lt;/a&gt;. Kill them and move forward to the tower. Enter the gate titled \"The Tower\" when you get past all of the enemies.\nOnce inside the tower, you will spot an &lt;a href=\"Abyssal%20Pearl\"&gt;Abyssal Pearl&lt;/a&gt; floating around a small whirlpool in the center of the room. Oriandra will say, \"The pearl. It's the key to escaping this mind trap.\" Approach the pearl and examine it.\nInstantly, you will be blinded by a flash of light, and K'Tora will say, \"Not so fast, little worm! Let's see how you fare against this nightmare!\" A &lt;a href=\"Yaghra%20Nightmare\"&gt;Yaghra Nightmare&lt;/a&gt; will appear in front of you. Use any of the weapons you have gathered so far to kill it. After you defeat the nightmare, Oriandra will say, \"Well done! Now destroy the pearl and wake up.\" Approach the pearl a second time and press the button indicated to destroy it.\nAfter doing this, you will be transported to the &lt;a href=\"Prisoner%27s%20Hold\"&gt;Prisoner's Hold&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Summerset%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Summerset&lt;/a&gt;. Oriandra will appear in a non-spectral form, saying, \"Easy now. You did well.\" Talk to her, and she will reveal her membership in the &lt;a href=\"Psijic%20Order%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Psijic Order&lt;/a&gt; and give additional details about what happened to you:\n\"It gladdens my heart to see you awake and free, my friend. You're the first to respond to my help and escape from that entity's grasp.\"\nIf you exit the dialogue box before pressing the \"Complete Quest\" button and speak to Oriandra again, the following conversation will occur, allowing you to finish it:\n\"With my help, you were able to extract yourself from K'Tora's mind trap. I just hope that the techniques I used to assist you will work on the others.\"\nIf either of the final two dialogue options are chosen, Oriandra will simply say the lines that she would have said initially, had you chosen to ask her about the Psijic Order prior to completing the quest.\nTo exit Prisoner's Hold, simply walk to the gate to your right and activate it. Outside, the city of &lt;a href=\"Shimmerene%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Shimmerene&lt;/a&gt; may be found in the distance. A frightened &lt;a href=\"Altmer%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Altmer&lt;/a&gt; named &lt;a href=\"Calibar\"&gt;Calibar&lt;/a&gt; will quickly approach you, shouting about a recent attack by strange creatures. Speak to him to begin the next quest in the main questline, \"&lt;a href=\"The%20Queen%27s%20Decree\"&gt;The Queen's Decree&lt;/a&gt;.\""}

Because this is locked, the Dragonborn must talk to one of the maids and tell her that Falk asked them to clean up the area and she will hand over the key. If Falk likes them well enough (for example, after accepting \"&lt;a href=\"The%20Man%20Who%20Cried%20Wolf\"&gt;The Man Who Cried Wolf&lt;/a&gt;\"), then Falk will present the key.\nThe Dragonborn then should enter the Pelagius Wing and go to the second floor. They must walk down the hallway with the red and yellow carpet draped along it and they will automatically be transported into Pelagius' mind, while inside the Dragonborn will not have access to their inventory, and equipped items will be replaced with a set of fine clothing.\nPelagius' mind.\nAfter arriving in Pelagius' mind, the Dragonborn will be facing Sheogorath, Daedric Prince of Madness, and Pelagius who are having a tea party. Once Pelagius leaves, talk to Sheogorath. He will tell the Dragonborn that the only way to leave Pelagius' mind is to \"treat\" it. Sheogorath gives the Dragonborn his Daedric artifact, the Wabbajack, to use to do this. The glade around the table has three stone portals with paths leading to where the Dragonborn will treat aspects of Pelagius' mind.\nParanoia.\nFrom his earliest years, Pelagius suffered terrible paranoia. The Dragonborn can fix this by going through the northwest portal. Following the path leads to a stonework arena with two Storm Atronachs fighting and &lt;a href=\"Pelagius%20the%20Suspicious\"&gt;Pelagius the Suspicious&lt;/a&gt; with two of his &lt;a href=\"Bodyguard%20%28Pelagius%29\"&gt;bodyguards&lt;/a&gt; on the opposite side, all wearing Dwarven armor. Sheogorath explains that the Dragonborn's monster must win. The Dragonborn should not use the Wabbajack on the battling atronachs, because the other will transform as well and the stalemate will continue indefinitely. Instead, they must shoot the bodyguards on the opposite side of the arena with the Wabbajack. After a few failed attempts Sheogorath will give a hint: \"Me thinks your aim is off.\" The men then turn into wolves and kill Pelagius the Suspicious in between them. This resolves the situation and cures the paranoia. The Dragonborn must then return to the tea party area.\nNight terrors.\nPelagius has had nightmares all his life. To help fix this, the Dragonborn must go through the northeast portal and find a sleeping Pelagius. Shooting Pelagius with Wabbajack will make the &lt;a href=\"Wolf%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;wolf&lt;/a&gt; appear. Shooting the wolf will turn him into a &lt;a href=\"Goat%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;goat&lt;/a&gt;. After Pelagius is shot again, the &lt;a href=\"Bandits%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;bandit chief&lt;/a&gt; will appear. When he is shot, he will turn into &lt;a href=\"Little%20Pelagius\"&gt;Little Pelagius&lt;/a&gt;. The Dragonborn must then shoot Pelagius with the Wabbajack to make the &lt;a href=\"Hagraven%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;hagraven&lt;/a&gt; appear, then shoot the hagraven to turn it into a &lt;a href=\"Sultry%20Maiden\"&gt;Sultry Maiden&lt;/a&gt;. The next creature that would appear is a &lt;a href=\"Flame%20Atronach%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;flame atronach&lt;/a&gt; who turns into a bonfire. After that the &lt;a href=\"Dragon%20Priests%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;dragon priest&lt;/a&gt; will appear who will be turned into a treasure chest when shot. Completing this will eventually make &lt;a href=\"Pelagius%20the%20Tormented\"&gt;Pelagius the Tormented&lt;/a&gt; wake up. Once Pelagius gets up out of the bed, the Night Terrors section is over. Note that the chest that spawns near the campfire cannot be looted.\nAnger issues.\nTo help Pelagius with his anger issues, the Dragonborn must go through the southeast portal. The Dragonborn must use the Wabbajack twice on the little guy named &lt;a href=\"Confidence%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Confidence&lt;/a&gt; to make him grow larger, then use the Wabbajack on &lt;a href=\"Anger\"&gt;Anger&lt;/a&gt; to make him smaller. The Dragonborn should ignore the &lt;a href=\"Self%20Doubt\"&gt;Self Doubt&lt;/a&gt;s that appear to help Anger until Sheogorath speaks again. At the end, Pelagius is finally ready to love himself (but continue hating everyone else). The protagonist must then return to the tea party glade.\nConclusion.\nOnce done, the Dragonborn should return to Sheogorath. He will give the Dragonborn the Wabbajack, plus the &lt;a href=\"fine%20clothes\"&gt;fine clothes&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"fine%20boots\"&gt;fine boots&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"fine%20hat\"&gt;fine hat&lt;/a&gt; which were given at the start of the quest, then sends them back to the Pelagius Wing of the Blue Palace. The quest is completed after returning back to Skyrim, though the &lt;a href=\"Lockpicking%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Lockpicking&lt;/a&gt; skill book \"&lt;a href=\"Surfeit%20of%20Thieves\"&gt;Surfeit of Thieves&lt;/a&gt;\" is located nearby where the Dragonborn appears. To get it, the Dragonborn should then go down the hall to the stairs, and visit the cellar at the end. The book is in the center of the cellar room, located on top of a box which supports a chain rack."}

He says that it used to be standard equipment for a trainer.\nContents.\nThe wind blew over the open plain, jostling the few trees within to move back and forth with the irritation of it. A young man in bright green turban approached the army and gave his chieftain's terms for peace to the commander. He was refused. It was to be battle, the battle of Ain-Kolur.\nSo the Chief Iymbez had decreed his open defiance and his horsemen were at war once again. Many times the tribe had moved into territory that was not theirs to occupy, and many times the diplomatic approach had failed. It had come to this, at long last. It was just as well with Mindothrax. His allies may win or lose, but he would always survive. Though he had occasionally been on the losing side of a war, never once in all his thirty-four years had he lost in hand-to-hand combat.\nThe two armies poured like dual frothing streams through the dust, and when they met a clamor rang out, echoing into the hills. Blood, the first liquor the clay had tasted in many a month, danced like powder. The high and low battle cries of the rival tribes met in harmony as the armies dug into one another's flesh. Mindothrax was in the element he loved.\nAfter ten hours of fighting with no ground given, both commanders called a mutual and honorable withdrawal from the field.\nThe camp was positioned in a high-walled garden of an old burial ground, adorned by springtide blossoms. As Mindothrax toured the grounds, he was reminded of his childhood home. It was a happy and a sad recollection, the purity of childhood ambition, all of his schooling in the ways of battle, but tinged with memories of his poor mother. A beautiful woman looking down at her son with both pride and unspoken sorrow. She never talked about what troubled her, but it came as no surprise to any when she took the walk across the moors and was found days later, her throat slit open by her own hand.\nThe army itself was like a colony of ants, newly shaken. Within a half hour's time after the end of the battle, they had reorganized as if by instinct. As the medicos looked to the wounded, someone remarked, with a measure of admiration and astonishment, \u201cLook at Mindothrax. His hair isn't even out of place.\u201d\n\u201cHe is a mighty swordsman,\u201d said the attending physician.\n\u201cThe sword is a greatly overvalued article,\u201d said Mindothrax, nevertheless pleased with the attention. \u201cWarriors pay too much attention to striking and not enough in defending strikes. The proper way to go into battle is to defend yourself, and to hit your opponent only when the ideal moment arises.\u201d\n\u201cI prefer a more straight-forward approach,\u201d smiled one of the wounded. \u201cIt is the way of the horse men.\u201d\n\u201cIf it is the way of the &lt;a href=\"Bjoulsae%20River\"&gt;Bjoulsae&lt;/a&gt; tribes to fail, then I renounce my heritage,\u201d said Mindothrax, making a quick sign to the spirits that he was being expressive not blasphemous. \u201cRemember what the great blademaster &lt;a href=\"Gaiden%20Shinji\"&gt;Gaiden Shinji&lt;/a&gt; said, 'The best techniques are passed on by the survivors.' I have been in thirty-six battles, and I haven't a scar to show for them. That is because I rely on my shield, and then my blade, in that order.\u201d\n\u201cWhat is your secret?\u201d\n\u201cThink of melee as a mirror. I look to my opponent's left arm when I am striking with my right. If he is prepared to block my blow, I blow not. Why exert undue force?\u201d Mindothrax cocked an eyebrow, \u201cBut when I see his right arm tense, my left arm goes to my shield. You see, it takes twice as much power to send force than it does to deflect it. When your eye can recognize whether your opponent is striking from above, or at angle, or in an uppercut from below, you learn to pivot and place your shield just so to protect yourself. I could block for hours if need be, but it only takes a few minutes, or even seconds, for your opponent, used to battering, to leave a space open for your own strike.\u201d\n\u201cWhat was the longest you've ever had to defend yourself?\u201d asked the wounded man.\n\u201cI fought a man once for an hour's time,\u201d said Mindothrax. \u201cHe was tireless with his bludgeoning, never giving me a moment to do aught but block his strikes. But finally, he took a moment too long in raising his cudgel and I found my mark in his chest. He struck my shield a thousand times, and I struck his heart but once. But that was enough.\u201d\n\u201cSo he was your greatest opponent?\u201d asked the medico.\n\u201cOh, indeed not,\u201d said Mindothrax, turning his great shield so the silvery metal reflected his own face. \u201cThere is he.\u201d\nThe next day, the battle recommenced. Chief Iymbez had brought in reinforcements from the islands to the south. To the horror and disgrace of the tribe, mercenaries, renegade horsemen and even some &lt;a href=\"Hagraven\"&gt;Reachmen witches&lt;/a&gt; were included in the war. As Mindothrax stared across the field at the armies assembling, putting on his helmet and readying his shield and blade, he thought again of his poor mother. What had tortured her so? Why had she never been able to look at her son without grief?\nBetween sunrise and sundown, the battle raged. A bright blue-sky overhead burned down on the combatants as they rushed against one another over and over again. In every melee, Mindothrax prevailed. A foe with an ax rained a series of strokes against his shield, but every one was deflected until at last Mindothrax could best the warrior. A spear maiden nearly pierced the shield with her first strike, but Mindothrax knew how to give with the blow, throwing her off balance and leaving her open for his counterstrike. Finally, he met a mercenary on the field, armed with shield and sword and a helm of golden bronze. For an hour and a half they battled.\nMindothrax tried every trick he knew. When the mercenary tensed his left arm, he held back his strike. When his opponent rose his sword, his shield rose too and expertly blocked. For the first time in his life, he was battling another defensive fighter. Stationary, reflective, with energy to battle for days if need be. Occasionally, another warrior would enter into the fray, sometimes from Mindothrax's army, sometimes from his opponent's. These distractions were swiftly dispatched, and the champions returned to their fight.\nAs they fought, circling one another, matching block for blow and blow for block, it dawned on Mindothrax that here at last he was fighting the perfect mirror.\nIt became more a game, almost a dance, than a battle of blood. It was not until Mindothrax missed his own step, striking too soon, throwing himself off balance, that the promenade was ended. He saw, rather than felt, the mercenary's blade rip across him from throat to chest. A good strike. The sort he himself might have delivered.\nMindothrax fell to the ground, feeling his life passing. The mercenary stood over him, prepared to give his worthy adversary the killing blow. It was a strange, honorable deed for an outsider to do, and Mindothrax was greatly moved. Across the battlefield, he heard someone call a name, similar to his own.\n\u201cJurrifax!\u201d\nThe mercenary removed his helmet to answer the call. As he did so, Mindothrax saw through the slits of his helmet his own reflection in the man. It was his own close-set eyes, red and brown hair, thin and wide mouth, and blunt chin. For a moment he marveled at the mirror, before the stranger turned back to him and delivered the death stroke.\nJurrifax returned to his commander and was well paid for his part in the day's victory. They retired for a hot meal under the stars in a garden by an old cairn that had previously been occupied by their foes. The mercenary was strangely quiet as he observed the land.\n\u201cHave you been here before, Jurrifax?\u201d asked one of the tribesmen who had hired him.\n\u201cI was born a horseman just like you. My mother sold me when I was just a babe. I have always wondered how my life might have been different had I not been bartered away. I might never have been a mercenary.\u201d\n\u201cThere are many things that decide our fate,\u201d said the witch. \u201cIt is madness to try to see how you might have taken this turn or that in the world. There are none exactly like yourself, so it is foolish to compare.\u201d\n\u201cBut there is one,\u201d said Jurrifax, looking to the stars. \u201cMy master, before he set me free, said that my mother had twin sons when I was born. She could only afford to raise but one child, but somewhere out there, there is a man just like me. My brother. I hope to meet him.\u201d\nThe witch saw the spirits before her and knew the truth that the twins had met already. She remained silent and stared into the fire, banishing the thoughts from her head, too wise to tell all."}

The Thief has been mysteriously absent except for when she appears to speak to me in private.\"\nWalkthrough.\nUpon completing \"&lt;a href=\"The%20Warrior%27s%20Call\"&gt;The Warrior's Call&lt;/a&gt;\" and \"&lt;a href=\"Elemental%20Army\"&gt;Elemental Army&lt;/a&gt;,\" a woman named Cursare will approach you. She will tell you that something strange has happened in &lt;a href=\"Belkarth%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Belkarth&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href=\"Hara\"&gt;Hara&lt;/a&gt; has entered her chambers with &lt;a href=\"Kelmen%20Locke\"&gt;Kelmen Locke&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Titus%20Valerius\"&gt;Titus Valerius&lt;/a&gt;, and has not been heard from since. Cursare suspects it has something to do with &lt;a href=\"The%20Thief%20%28Celestial%29\"&gt;the Thief&lt;/a&gt;.\nHead back to the &lt;a href=\"Star-Gazers%27%20Observatory\"&gt;Star-Gazers' Observatory&lt;/a&gt; and speak with &lt;a href=\"Nazdura\"&gt;Nazdura&lt;/a&gt; about the situation. She will tell you that Hara wants to speak with you in private about the visions you have been having of the Thief. Hara will be upstairs, in her private quarters. When you arrive, something will come over Hara; she will collapse, mutter something like \"he found me\" and tell you to head to &lt;a href=\"Reinhold%27s%20Retreat\"&gt;Reinhold's Retreat&lt;/a&gt;, then she will disappear. Speak with &lt;a href=\"Titus%20Valerius\"&gt;Titus Valerius&lt;/a&gt; about this and and he will tell you that Reinhold's Retreat was buried by &lt;a href=\"Emperor%20Tarish-Zi\"&gt;Emperor Tarish-Zi&lt;/a&gt; in the distant past, and that it should be right beneath the city of &lt;a href=\"Belkarth%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Belkarth&lt;/a&gt;. He will tell you to meet him and Kelmen Locke by the lake in the south of town, so that Kelmen may try to use his magic to gain entrance to the ancient site. \nHead down to the lake; Titus and Kelmen will be standing by some ancient stone structures. Speak with Kelmen and he will tell you these stones used to be just stones, but now they are radiating with energy, which indicates someone recently used them to get into Reinhold's Retreat. He will suggest you search for an entrance by activating the sconces found on islands throughout the water. Activating all four of them will cause a whirlpool to appear in the center of the lake; this is your passage into the retreat. Kelmen and Titus will follow you inside; once there, start looking around. You will have to face off against many of the &lt;a href=\"Scaled%20Court\"&gt;Scaled Court&lt;/a&gt; on your way through, but you should press on to the other end of the hallway. Upon entering the Hall of the Oathkeepers, Kelmen will remark that he feels the presence of a powerful sorcerer nearby. \nThis sorcerer is Madleena Blackvein, who awaits just ahead. When engaging her, Madleena will tell you that the Thief's Apex Stone has fallen into their hands. During the battle, she will at times become invulnerable and summon &lt;a href=\"Lamia\"&gt;Lamia&lt;/a&gt;s to help her out; kill the lamias to make her vulnerable again. Once she is dead, you should begin your search for the Thief's Apex Stone. This search is not hard, as this entire dungeon is one giant hallway. Proceed ahead into the Star-Gazer Sactuary. There, you will see the Serpent trying to corrupt the Apex Stone. You will also see that he has captured Hara at the stone. To end this corruption, you must repeatedly fight off a wave of enemies, then activate both the beacons at the sides of the battlefield. After doing this a few times, &lt;a href=\"The%20Serpent%27s%20Corruption\"&gt;The Serpent's Corruption&lt;/a&gt; will attack you; defeat it, and the corruption will be cleansed. Hara will come down and reveal that she is in fact the Thief herself. She posed as a mortal to escape the Serpent's gaze and recruit mortals to help free the other guardians. She will stansport you back to Belkarth now; speak with her again in the Star-Gazers' Observatory to finish the quest."}

Her eyes shined with worlds unseen, so magnificent and bright that beautiful &lt;a href=\"Summerset%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Summerset&lt;/a&gt; paled in comparison. She tried to paint these vibrant scenes, but found common colors lacking. How could she bring her visions to life?\nIn this hour of desperation, a poor merchant knocked on her door. He was a scraggly old man, with no companion but the hound at his feet.\n\"Would you consider buying this paintbrush?\" the poor merchant asked. \"I see by your house that you're an artist. With this you'll be able to truly bring life into your work.\"\nIntrigued, the artist agreed to pay a meager sum for this paintbrush. It was rather large, with a white tip and black ivory handle. She was told it was called the Monochrome Paintbrush, but to not let the name fool her. And so the old merchant left with a satisfied smile on his face.\nThe artist went to work at once, and before her eyes the impossible occurred. What had been mere paint just moments before became sparkling and shining, with depths yet unknown. It went beyond color and emotion, transcended anything she had seen before. Finally, finally, the colors matched those images she had long since had in her head.\nBut, as she painted, a strange thing happened. First, the color began to fade from her lips, the tips of her fingers, the point of her nose. Her hair turned from a golden yellow to a faded white, her clothes lost their blue and purples and turned to shades of gray.\nShe did not notice. She painted, and painted, and painted away. She was lost within the scene she was creating, and her body turned white, and black, and gray. Her eyes grew heavy, and heartbeats further and further apart, until suddenly she collapsed.\nBefore her body was the most beautiful painting in all of Summerset. It's said to still hang to this day, though it was never seen in &lt;a href=\"Nirn\"&gt;Nirn&lt;/a&gt; again."}
{"id": "6148", "revid": "17401442", "url": "https://elderscrolls.fandom.com/wiki?curid=6148", "title": "The Monomyth", "text": "The Monomyth is a &lt;a href=\"book\"&gt;book&lt;/a&gt; in and .\nContents.\nSimply put, the schism in the &lt;a href=\"Men\"&gt;Men&lt;/a&gt;/&lt;a href=\"Aldmer\"&gt;Aldmer&lt;/a&gt;i worldview is the mortal's relationship to the divine. Men take the humble path that they were created by the immortal forces, while the Aldmer claim descent from them. It doesn't seem like much, but it is a distinction that colors the rest of their diverging mythologies.\nAll &lt;a href=\"Tamriel\"&gt;Tamriel&lt;/a&gt;ic religions begin the same. Man or Mer, things begin with the dualism of &lt;a href=\"Anu\"&gt;Anu&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Padomay\"&gt;His Other&lt;/a&gt;. These twin forces go by many names: Anu-Padomay, Aniel-&lt;a href=\"Sithis\"&gt;Sithis&lt;/a&gt;, Ak-El, &lt;a href=\"Satak\"&gt;Satak&lt;/a&gt;-&lt;a href=\"Akel\"&gt;Akel&lt;/a&gt;, Is-Is Not. &lt;a href=\"Anuiel\"&gt;Anuiel&lt;/a&gt; is the Everlasting Ineffable Light, Sithis is the Corrupting Inexpressible Action. In the middle is the Gray Maybe ('&lt;a href=\"Nirn\"&gt;Nirn&lt;/a&gt;' in the Ehlnofex).\nIn most cultures, Anuiel is honored for his part of the interplay that creates the world, but Sithis is held in highest esteem because he's the one that causes the reaction. Sithis is thus the Original Creator, an entity who intrinsically causes change without design. Even the &lt;a href=\"hist\"&gt;hist&lt;/a&gt; acknowledge this being.\nAnuiel is also perceived of as Order, opposed to the Sithis-Chaos. Perhaps it is easier for mortals to envision change than perfect stasis, for often Anuiel is relegated to the mythic background of Sithis' fancies. In &lt;a href=\"Yokuda\"&gt;Yokuda&lt;/a&gt;n folk-tales, which are among the most vivid in the world, Satak is only referred to a handful of times, as \"the Hum\"; he is a force so prevalent as to be not really there at all.\nIn any case, from these two beings spring the &lt;a href=\"et%27Ada\"&gt;et'Ada&lt;/a&gt;, or Original Spirits. To humans these et'Ada are the Gods and Demons; to the Aldmer, the &lt;a href=\"Aedra\"&gt;Aedra&lt;/a&gt;/&lt;a href=\"Daedra\"&gt;Daedra&lt;/a&gt;, or the 'Ancestors'. All of the &lt;a href=\"Tamriel\"&gt;Tamriel&lt;/a&gt;ic pantheons fill their rosters from these et'Ada, though divine membership often differs from culture to culture. Like Anu and Padomay, though, every one of these pantheons contains the archetypes of the Dragon God and the Missing God.\nThe Dragon God and the Missing God\nThe Dragon God is always related to Time, and is universally revered as the \"First God.\" He is often called &lt;a href=\"Akatosh\"&gt;Akatosh&lt;/a&gt;, \"whose perch from Eternity allowed the day.\" He is the central God of the Cyrodilic Empire.\nThe Missing God is always related to the Mortal Plane, and is a key figure in the Human/Aldmeri schism. The 'missing' refers to either his palpable absence from the pantheon (another mental distress that is interpreted a variety of ways), or the removal of his 'divine spark' by the other immortals. He is often called &lt;a href=\"Lorkhan\"&gt;Lorkhan&lt;/a&gt;, and his epitaphs are many, equally damnable and devout.\nNote that Tamriel and the Mortal Plane do not exist yet. The Gray Maybe is still the playground of the Original Spirits. Some are more bound to Anu's light, others to the unknowable void. Their constant flux and interplay increase their number, and their personalities take long to congeal. When Akatosh forms, Time begins, and it becomes easier for some spirits to realize themselves as beings with a past and a future. The strongest of the recognizable spirits crystallize: &lt;a href=\"Mephala\"&gt;Mephala&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Arkay\"&gt;Arkay&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Y%27ffre\"&gt;Y'ffre&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Magnus\"&gt;Magnus&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Rupgta\"&gt;Rupgta&lt;/a&gt;, etc., etc. Others remain as concepts, ideas, or emotions. One of the strongest of these, a barely formed urge that the others call Lorkhan, details a plan to create &lt;a href=\"Mundus\"&gt;Mundus&lt;/a&gt;, the Mortal Plane.\nHumans, with the exception of the &lt;a href=\"Redguards\"&gt;Redguards&lt;/a&gt;, see this act as a divine mercy, an enlightenment whereby lesser creatures can reach immortality. Aldmer, with the exception of the Dark Elves, see this act as a cruel deception, a trick that sundered their connection to the spirit plane.\nThe Myth of Aurbis\nSubtitled \"The Psijiic Compensation,\" \"Mythic Aurbis\" was an attempt by &lt;a href=\"Artaeum\"&gt;Artaeum&lt;/a&gt; apologists to explain the basics of &lt;a href=\"Aldmer\"&gt;Aldmer&lt;/a&gt;i religion to &lt;a href=\"Uriel%20V\"&gt;Uriel V&lt;/a&gt; in the early, glorious part of his reign. It quietly avoided any blame or bias against the Lorkhan-concept, which was still held in esteem by the Cyrodiils as \"&lt;a href=\"Shezarr\"&gt;Shezarr&lt;/a&gt;\", the missing sibling of &lt;a href=\"the%20Divines\"&gt;the Divines&lt;/a&gt;. Despite this, the &lt;a href=\"Psijic%20Order\"&gt;Psijiici&lt;/a&gt; still give a nice summary of the Elder view, and it will serve our purposes here. This version comes from the archives of the Imperial Seminary from the handwritten notes of an unknown scribe.\nMythic Aurbis exists, and has existed from time without measure, as a fanciful Unnatural Realm.\n'Aurbis' is used to connote the imperceptible Penumbra, the Gray Center between the IS/IS NOT of Anu and Padomay. It contains the multitude realms of &lt;a href=\"Aetherius\"&gt;Aetherius&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Oblivion%20%28Realm%29\"&gt;Oblivion&lt;/a&gt;, as well as other, less structured forms.\nThe magical beings of Mythic Aurbis live for a long time and have complex narrative lives, creating the patterns of myth.\nThese are spirits made from bits of the immortal polarity. The first of these was Akatosh the Time Dragon, whose formation made it easier for other spirits to structure themselves. Gods and demons form and reform and procreate.\nFinally, the magical beings of Mythic Aurbis told the ultimate story\u2014that of their own death. For some this was an artistic transfiguration into the concrete, non-magical substance of the world. For others, this was a war in which all were slain, their bodies becoming the substance of the world. For yet others, this was a romantic marriage and parenthood, with the parent spirits naturally having to die and give way to the succeeding mortal races.\nThe agent of this communal decision was Lorkhan, whom most early myths vilify as a trickster or deceiver. More sympathetic versions of this story point out Lorkhan as being the reason the mortal plane exists at all.\nThe magical beings created the races of the mortal Aurbis in their own image, either consciously as artists and craftsmen, or as the fecund rotting matter out of which the mortals sprung forth, or in a variety of other analogical senses.\nThe magical beings, then, having died, became the et'Ada. The et'Ada are the things perceived and revered by the mortals as gods, spirits, or geniuses of Aurbis. Through their deaths, these magical beings separated themselves in nature from the other magical beings of the Unnatural realms.\nThe Daedra were created at this time also, being spirits and Gods more attuned to Oblivion, or that realm closer to the Void of Padomay. This act is the &lt;a href=\"Dawn%20Era\"&gt;dawn&lt;/a&gt; of the Mythic (&lt;a href=\"Merethic%20Era\"&gt;Merethic&lt;/a&gt;) Era. It has been perceived by the earliest mortals many different ways, either as a joyous 'second creation', or (especially by the Elves) as a painful fracturing from the divine. The originator of the event is always Lorkhan.\n&lt;a href=\"Lorkhan\"&gt;Lorkhan&lt;/a&gt;\nThis Creator-Trickster-Tester deity is in every Tamrielic mythic tradition. His most popular name is the Aldmeri \"Lorkhan,\" or Doom Drum. He convinced or contrived the Original Spirits to bring about the creation of the Mortal Plane, upsetting the status quo much like his father Padomay had introduced instability into the universe in the Beginning Place. After the world is materialized, Lorkhan is separated from his divine center, sometimes involuntarily, and wanders the creation of the et'Ada. Interpretations of these events differ widely by culture. Below are some of the better known:\n&lt;a href=\"Yokuda\"&gt;Yokuda&lt;/a&gt;n, \"&lt;a href=\"Satakal\"&gt;Satakal&lt;/a&gt; the Worldskin\"\n\"&lt;a href=\"Satakal\"&gt;Satak&lt;/a&gt; was First Serpent, the Snake who came Before, and all the worlds to come rested in the glimmer of its scales. But it was so big there was nothing but, and thus it was coiled around and around itself, and the worlds to come slid across each other but none had room to breathe or even be. And so the worlds called to something to save them, to let them out, but of course there was nothing outside the First Serpent, so aid had to come from inside it; this was Akel, the Hungry Stomach. Akel made itself known, and Satak could only think about what it was, and it was the best hunger, so it ate and ate. Soon there was enough room to live in the worlds and things began. These things were new and they often made mistakes, for there was hardly time to practice being things before. So most things ended quickly or were not good or gave up on themselves. Some things were about to start, but they were eaten up as Satak got to that part of its body. This was a violent time.\n\"Pretty soon Akel caused Satak to bite its own heart and that was the end. The hunger, though, refused to stop, even in death, and so the First Serpent shed its skin to begin anew. As the old world died, Satakal began, and when things realized this pattern so did they realize what their part in it was. They began to take names, like &lt;a href=\"Ruptga\"&gt;Ruptga&lt;/a&gt; or , and they strode about looking for their kin. As Satakal ate itself over and over, the strongest spirits learned to bypass the cycle by moving at strange angles. They called this process the Walkabout, a way of striding between the worldskins. Ruptga was so big that he was able to place the stars in the sky so that weaker spirits might find their way easier. This practice became so easy for the spirits that it became a place, called &lt;a href=\"the%20Far%20Shores\"&gt;the Far Shores&lt;/a&gt;, a time of waiting until the next skin.\n\"Ruptga was able to sire many children through the cycles and so he became known as the Tall Papa. He continued to place stars to map out the void for others, but after so many cycles there were almost too many spirits to help out. He made himself a helper from the detritus of past skins and this was Sep, or Second Serpent. Sep had much of the Hungry Stomach still left in him, multiple hungers from multiple skins. He was so hungry he could not think straight. Sometimes he would just eat the spirits he was supposed to help, but Tall Papa would always reach in and take them back out. Finally, tired of helping Tall Papa, Sep went and gathered the rest of the old skins and balled them up, tricking spirits to help him, promising them this was how you reached the new world, by making one out of the old. These spirits loved this way of living, as it was easier. No more jumping from place to place. Many spirits joined in, believing this was good thinking. Tall Papa just shook his head.\n\"Pretty soon the spirits on the skin-ball started to die, because they were very far from the real world of Satakal. And they found that it was too far to jump into the Far Shores now. The spirits that were left pleaded with Tall Papa to take them back. But grim Ruptga would not, and he told the spirits that they must learn new ways to follow the stars to the Far Shores now. If they could not, then they must live on through their children, which was not the same as before. Sep, however, needed more punishment, and so Tall Papa squashed the Snake with a big stick. The hunger fell out of Sep's dead mouth and was the only thing left of the Second Serpent. While the rest of the new world was allowed to strive back to godhood, Sep could only slink around in a dead skin, or swim about in the sky, a hungry void that jealously tried to eat the stars.\"\nCyrodiilic \"Shezarr's Song\"\n\"This was a new thing that &lt;a href=\"Shezarr\"&gt;Shezarr&lt;/a&gt; described to the Gods, becoming mothers and fathers, being responsible, and making great sacrifices, with no guarantee of success, but Shezarr spoke beautifully to them, and moved them beyond mystery and tears. Thus the Aedra gave free birth to the world, the beasts, and the beings, making these things from parts of themselves. This free birth was very painful, and afterwards the Aedra were no longer young, and strong, and powerful, as they had been from the beginning of days.\n\"Some Aedra were disappointed and bitter in their loss, and angry with Shezarr, and with all creation, for they felt Shezarr had lied and tricked them. These Aedra, the Gods of the Aldmer, led by &lt;a href=\"Auri-El\"&gt;Auri-El&lt;/a&gt;, were disgusted by their enfeebled selves, and by what they had created. 'Everything is spoiled, for now, and for all time, and the most we can do is teach the Elven Races to suffer nobly, with dignity, and chastise ourselves for our folly, and avenge ourselves upon Shezarr and his allies.' Thus are the Gods of the Elves dark and brooding, and thus are the Elves ever dissatisfied with mortality, and always proud and stoic despite the harshness of this cruel and indifferent world.\n\"Other Aedra looked upon creation, and were well pleased. These Aedra, the Gods of Men and Beast Folk, led by &lt;a href=\"Akatosh\"&gt;Akatosh&lt;/a&gt;, praised and cherished their wards, the Mortal Races. 'We have suffered, and are diminished, for all time, but the mortal world we have made is glorious, filling our hearts and spirits with hope. Let us teach the Mortal Races to live well, to cherish beauty and honor, and to love one another as we love them.' Thus are the Gods of Men tender and patient, and thus are Men and Beast Folk great in heart for joy or suffering, and ambitious for greater wisdom and a better world.\n\"Now when the Daedra Lords heard Shezarr, they mocked him, and the other Aedra. 'Cut parts of ourselves off? And lose them? Forever? That's stupid! You'll be sorry! We are far smarter than you, for we will create a new world out of ourselves, but we will not cut it off, or let it mock us, but we will make this world within ourselves, forever ours, and under our complete control.'\n\"So the Daedra Lords created the Daedric Realms, and all the ranks of Lesser Daedra, great and small. And, for the most part, the Daedra Lords were well pleased with this arrangement, for they always had worshippers and servants and playthings close to hand. But, at the same time, they sometimes looked with envy upon the Mortal Realms, for though mortals were foul and feeble and contemptible, their passions and ambitions were also far more surprising and entertaining than the antics of the Lesser Daedra. Thus do the Daedra Lords court and seduce certain amusing specimens of the Mortal Races, especially the passionate and powerful. It gives the Daedra Lords special pleasure to steal away from Shezarr and the Aedra the greatest and most ambitious mortals. 'Not only are you fools to mutilate yourselves,' gloat the Daedra Lords, 'But you cannot even keep the best pieces, which prefer the glory and power of the Daedra Lords to the feeble vulgarity of the mush-minded Aedra.'\"\n&lt;a href=\"Altmer\"&gt;Altmer&lt;/a&gt;i \"The Heart of the World\"\n\"Anu encompassed, and encompasses, all things. So that he might know himself he created Anuiel, his soul and the soul of all things. Anuiel, as all souls, was given to self-reflection, and for this he needed to differentiate between his forms, attributes, and intellects. Thus was born Sithis, who was the sum of all the limitations Anuiel would utilize to ponder himself. Anuiel, who was the soul of all things, therefore became many things, and this interplay was and is the Aurbis.\n\"At first the Aurbis was turbulent and confusing, as Anuiel's ruminations went on without design. Aspects of the Aurbis then asked for a schedule to follow or procedures whereby they might enjoy themselves a little longer outside of perfect knowledge. So that he might know himself this way, too, Anu created Auriel, the soul of his soul. Auriel bled through the Aurbis as a new force, called time. With time, various aspects of the Aurbis began to understand their natures and limitations. They took names, like &lt;a href=\"Magnus\"&gt;Magnus&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"Mara\"&gt;Mara&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"Xen\"&gt;Xen&lt;/a&gt;. One of these, Lorkhan, was more of a limit than a nature, so he could never last long anywhere.\n\"As he entered every aspect of Anuiel, Lorkhan would plant an idea that was almost wholly based on limitation. He outlined a plan to create a soul for the Aurbis, a place where the aspects of aspects might even be allowed to self-reflect. He gained many followers; even Auriel, when told he would become the king of the new world, agreed to help Lorkhan. So they created the Mundus, where their own aspects might live, and became the et'Ada.\n\"But this was a trick. As Lorkhan knew, this world contained more limitations than not and was therefore hardly a thing of Anu at all. Mundus was the House of Sithis. As their aspects began to die off, many of the et'Ada vanished completely. Some escaped, like Magnus, and that is why there are no limitations to magic. Others, like Y'ffre, transformed themselves into the &lt;a href=\"Ehlnofey\"&gt;Ehlnofey&lt;/a&gt;, the Earthbones, so that the whole world might not die. Some had to marry and make children just to last. Each generation was weaker than the last, and soon there were &lt;a href=\"Aldmer\"&gt;Aldmer&lt;/a&gt;. Darkness caved in. Lorkhan made armies out of the weakest souls and named them Men, and they brought Sithis into every quarter.\n\"Auriel pleaded with Anu to take them back, but he had already filled their places with something else. But his soul was gentler and granted Auriel his &lt;a href=\"Auriel%27s%20Bow\"&gt;Bow&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Auriel%27s%20Shield\"&gt;Shield&lt;/a&gt;, so that he might save the Aldmer from the hordes of Men. Some had already fallen, like the &lt;a href=\"Chimer\"&gt;Chimer&lt;/a&gt;, who listened to tainted et'Ada, and others, like the &lt;a href=\"Bosmer\"&gt;Bosmer&lt;/a&gt;, had soiled Time's line by taking Mannish wives.\n\"Auriel could not save &lt;a href=\"Altmora\"&gt;Altmora&lt;/a&gt;, the Elder Wood, and it was lost to Men. They were chased south and east to Old Ehlnofey, and Lorkhan was close behind. He shattered that land into many. Finally &lt;a href=\"Trinimac\"&gt;Trinimac&lt;/a&gt;, Auriel's greatest knight, knocked Lorkhan down in front of his army and reached in with more than hands to take his Heart. He was undone. The Men dragged Lorkhan's body away and swore blood vengeance on the heirs of Auriel for all time.\n\"But when Trinimac and Auriel tried to destroy the &lt;a href=\"Heart%20of%20Lorkhan\"&gt;Heart of Lorkhan&lt;/a&gt; it laughed at them. It said, \"This Heart is the heart of the world, for one was made to satisfy the other.\" So Auriel fastened the thing to an arrow and let it fly long into the sea, where no aspect of the new world may ever find it.\""}

Follow her into the &lt;a href=\"Temple%20of%20the%20Dance\"&gt;Temple of the Dance&lt;/a&gt;, and you will find the spirit of Rid-Thar-ri'Datta there; speak with him and he will tell you to breathe in the moon sugar vapors and align the reflectors here to the moonlight so that you can see what the Bright Moons wish you to see. \nSimply activate the crystals to align them. Each will show you a scene from the past. Once you have aligned all the white crystals, align the yellow one to their northwest, and a portal will appear at the base of the central pillar. It will lead you to &lt;a href=\"The%20Demi-Plane%20of%20Jode\"&gt;The Demi-Plane of Jode&lt;/a&gt;. Talk to the Champion and they will tell you that this is the plane of the gods, and that it will change itself to reflect the challenges you face. After the conversation, a vision of a Bosmer will show up and show you the way. Follow it up the stairs and you will find a portal. \nHead through the portal and you will find a vision of the Silvenar abandoning a man named &lt;a href=\"Elilor\"&gt;Elilor&lt;/a&gt;; speak with him and he will tell you that ever since the Khajiit broke away from the Aldmeri Dominion, they have been under increasing pressure and had no choice but to invoke the &lt;a href=\"Wild%20Hunt\"&gt;Wild Hunt&lt;/a&gt;. The Hunt turned on them though, and now the Silvenar and the Green Lady are under threat. Your task will be to protect them. Head on along the path to where they are, and you will be attacked by Feral Bosmer and Werewolves. Fend them all off, and the two Bosmer leaders will head off. The Silvenar will collapse during the escape though; talk to the Green Lady and she will reiterate that the Khajiit fell away from the Dominion after &lt;a href=\"Akkhuz-ri\"&gt;Akkhuz-ri&lt;/a&gt;'s fall, which led to all of this. The Silvenar will now wake and tell you to get out of there, before he turns into a werewolf. Kill the Silvenar's werewolf form, then speak with the Green Lady again. She will blame the Aldmeri Dominion and &lt;a href=\"Queen%20Ayrenn%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Queen Ayrenn&lt;/a&gt; for what happened; they held Valenwood and Elsweyr so tight they suffocated. This is the end of the Bosmer people. \nA portal will now appear that will lead you back to the temple. Talk to the future Mane there and she will reflect on how all this came to pass because no one succeeded Akkhuz-ri as mane. Proceed up the path and you will find the bodies of Altmer soldiers strewn about. Across the bridge, you will find another portal; head through to find yourself in Summerset. Head up the road, and you will find a soldier named Cariel; speak with her and she will tell you that the &lt;a href=\"Veiled%20Heritance\"&gt;Veiled Heritance&lt;/a&gt; has led another uprising and has taken over all of the Summerset Isles; the &lt;a href=\"Eyes%20of%20the%20Queen\"&gt;Eyes of the Queen&lt;/a&gt; have put up a last defense here. She will direct you to speak to Razum-dar atop the hill; fight your way there and speak with him. \nRaz will tell you that &lt;a href=\"Battlereeve%20Urcelmo\"&gt;Battlereeve Urcelmo&lt;/a&gt; has turned on the queen, and that the other alliances have taken Cyrodiil and are now marching on Summerset. He will ask you to head into the Ayleid Ruin up ahead to protect Queen Ayrenn. The Heritance is already inside; fight your way through until you find Ayrenn in the inner sanctum. She is under attack by Urcelmo; slay her attacker, then head outside and speak with Ayrenn there. She is badly injured and will soon be dead, but she says the wounds to the Dominion itself are about as grave. The Khajiit have retreated into the desert, the Bosmer have destroyed themselves through the Hunt, and now the Heritance has wrecked the Summerset Isles. Ayrenn will ask you to leave her here to die. \nA new portal will open up leading you back to the temple. There, talk to the Lunar Champion again and she will reflect on what you just saw. This will finish the quest and start the next one, \"&lt;a href=\"The%20Den%20of%20Lorkhaj\"&gt;The Den of Lorkhaj&lt;/a&gt;.\""}

Some are even said to have wings, though the idea of these hulking brutes taking to the air is hard to credit. But where do they come from, and why? Read on, for this great mystery at last has a solution!\nTales of gargoyles are widespread across &lt;a href=\"Tamriel\"&gt;Tamriel&lt;/a&gt;, but few can claim to have actually seen one. (Have you ever seen one? Has anyone you know ever seen one? I didn't think so. And I'm rarely wrong about such things. As you know if you've read my other pamphlets. If you haven't read my other pamphlets you are sadly under-informed, and have missed out on several life-changing money-making opportunities. You would be wise to correct this deficiency.)\nBut back to the business at hand: gargoyles! They're few and far between. However, it is well known that they can be found deep in the depths of the deserts of &lt;a href=\"Hammerfell%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Hammerfell&lt;/a&gt;, hunkering atop crumbling crags as they gaze balefully down upon their potential prey, preparing to dive and rend it with their stony, taloned hands! Is it any wonder few have survived to tell of such an encounter?\nAt any event: Hammerfell, depths of the deserts thereof, that's where we find our elusive gargoyles! But gargoyles are not the only legendary denizens of the depths of the deserts, are they? No! In fact, according to long-time Redguard legend, when those doughty warriors first arrived on the shores of &lt;a href=\"Tamriel\"&gt;Tamriel&lt;/a&gt; they found the deserts of Hammerfell occupied by\u2014Giant Goblins!\nGiant Goblins! Goblins, but giant-sized! In other words: great misshapen humanoids, gray-green of skin, with gnarled, tusked faces, horns, and pointed ears. Where have we heard that before \u2026?\nRevelation! Epiphany! You get it, do you not? Take a look at a Goblin, then look at a gargoyle\u2014very well, look at a picture of a gargoyle, because as I believe we've established none of us have ever seen one in person\u2014but anyway, just look at them! Can such a resemblance be a coincidence? Well, I don't know about you, but my mother didn't raise anyone that gullible! Coincidence? My eye! It's as plain as their tusky faces that the Hammerfell Giant Goblins (legendary) and the Hammerfell gargoyles (a matter of public record) are, in point of fact, One And The Same. Why, a fool couldn't tell them apart, blindfolded."}

Very little was discovered at the ruin as a result of the disturbances, and the dig was eventually abandoned.\nFurther expeditions became ill advised when the ruin was infested with &lt;a href=\"Goblin%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Goblins&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Second%20Era\"&gt;2E 545&lt;/a&gt;.

Legend and mysteries abound, filling its streets and taverns with tales from all around the world. One of these stories doesn't originate in some far-off land. Anvil has its own incarnation of the city's beauty and charm, hewn from stone older than any lain in the building foundations\u2014the Mermaid of Anvil.\nWith no inscription decorating its base and no certificate of origin stored in the city records, the Mermaid remains a blank canvas upon which locals and visitors alike have painted their own picture. Her carefree repose and immodest attitude have earned her a multitude of names and titles\u2014some of which are not suitable to be printed here. Whether you know her as the wistful Brine Maiden, the Leggy Lass, the Salty Serenader, the Stone Seductress, or a hundred other monikers, the Mermaid of Anvil never fails to leave a lasting impression on all who gaze upon her.\nWhat about the Mermaid so manages to enthrall us? The gentle curves of pale rock create a fancy figure, certainly, but was she laid bare for the sake of art? The sheer scale of her grandeur rivals many statues erected to the &lt;a href=\"Nine%20Divines\"&gt;Divines&lt;/a&gt;, the royals of &lt;a href=\"Tamriel\"&gt;Tamriel&lt;/a&gt;, or the &lt;a href=\"Daedric%20Princes\"&gt;Daedric Princes&lt;/a&gt; themselves, leading some to speculate that the Mermaid was once a figure of similar stature to her unknown creators. Could our fair Mermaid actually be a long forgotten god or an unrecognized aspect of one of the Divines? Certainly the more scandalizing rumors suggest she might be &lt;a href=\"Azura\"&gt;Azura&lt;/a&gt; as she appeared to some ancient sea-dwelling civilization, but it's hard to imagine the &lt;a href=\"Sload\"&gt;Sload&lt;/a&gt; being capable of making something of such beauty. And what does that leave? The &lt;a href=\"Dreugh%20%28Online%29\"&gt;dreugh&lt;/a&gt;? No, more believable to imagine that &lt;a href=\"Maormer\"&gt;Sea Elves&lt;/a&gt; once had scales and gills.\nWe know so little about who or what the Mermaid truly represents, and even less about who may or may not have created her. There's no credible record of who painstakingly carved and polished the great stone that gave birth to our patron beauty. Many have attempted to explain the origin of the Mermaid, or even assert that some long lost ancestor was responsible for her design. No matter how reputable the source, however, further investigation always reveals the statue to predate any such claims. In fact, the most recent archaeological study indicates that the Mermaid easily pre-dates any structure in Anvil, indicating that at least a few of her admirers were so taken with her as to set down roots in her shadow and build the city around her fine form. Would she be amused or embarrassed to know an entire city has sprung up to gaze upon her? One look at her coy expression says that even if she could answer, she'd never dispel her air of mystery.\nAnd that's why the people of Anvil love her."}

I have it on good authority that at least one prominent Psijc monk, the &lt;a href=\"Altmer%20%28Online%29\"&gt;High Elf&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Lilatha\"&gt;Lilatha&lt;/a&gt;, has made an effort to contract champions with a warning concerning the return of the Clockwork City of &lt;a href=\"Sotha%20Sil\"&gt;Sotha Sil&lt;/a&gt;. I shall endeavor to discover the reasons for these reappearances and try to determine if they pint to the return of &lt;a href=\"Artaeum\"&gt;Artaeum&lt;/a&gt; as well.\nOur military leaders have expressed concern over these events. A number of our religious scholars have also expressed concern, as they appear to be evenly divided on the opinion as to whether or not the return of Artaeum (if indeed it has returned) indicated good portents or ill omens.\nI uncovered the following details about the island from ancient records. Idyllic orchards, clear pastures, and misty woodlands make up the majority of the island's terrain, along with a number of still and silent lagoons. Eyewitness reports from more than five hundred years ago\u2014the last time Artaeum was known to be present off the southwest coast of &lt;a href=\"Summerset%20Isles%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Summerset&lt;/a&gt;\u2014describe the unique architecture that appeared to be as natural as the countryside surrounding it. The Cephorah Tower supposedly rises above the isle. This relic from an age before the High Elves serves as the headquarters of the mysterious Psijic Order and guards the entrance to the Dreaming Cave. Legends say that Sotha Sil, among others, used the cave as a sort of portal for traveling to the realms of Oblivion. The records indicate that Artaeum disappeared from its location in &lt;a href=\"Tamriel\"&gt;Tamriel&lt;/a&gt; some three hundred-and-fifty years ago.\nThe gray-cloaked members of the Psijic Order, a magical monastic society that pre-dates the &lt;a href=\"Mages%20Guild%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Mages Guild&lt;/a&gt;, once served as advisors on spiritual and magical matters to the rulers of Tamriel. Whether these sightings of Artaeum mages signals the return of the Psijics to political concerns, we have not bee able to determine. We have almost not been able to confirm if the Ritemaster Iachesis still leads the ancient order, as numerous requests to meet with Psijic representatives have been ignored.\nAdditional information about the Psijic Order follows.\nThe Psijic monks follow the \"Old Ways,\" combining mysticism, the Eleven Forces, and the divine laws that bind and define the nature of reality into a philosophy and way of life. They are said to have a deep understanding of the &lt;a href=\"Ehlnofey\"&gt;Ehlnofey&lt;/a&gt;, also known as the Earth Bones, the descendants of the &lt;a href=\"Aedra\"&gt;Aedra&lt;/a&gt; who once walked Tamriel and gave rise to the races of &lt;a href=\"man\"&gt;man&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"mer\"&gt;mer&lt;/a&gt;. Much of the ritual-based magic the order employs utilizes this understanding, supposedly granting them influence over time and weather. In their day, they were the world's preeminent scryers, capable of perceiving events across great distances of time and space. It is said they also command powers of communications superior to other practitioners of magic.\nWhat this means for Summerset and the &lt;a href=\"Aldmeri%20Dominion%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Aldmeri Dominion&lt;/a&gt; has yet to be ascertained. It would behoove us to acquire the services of the Psijic Order for our alliance, but so far they have refused all efforts on our part to open a dialogue of any sort. We have also received reports from spies in &lt;a href=\"Morrowind%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Morrowind&lt;/a&gt; that Sotha Sil's Clockwork City has been located. His association with the Psijic Order and Artaeum are well documented, so I shall make a journey to the land of the &lt;a href=\"Dunmer%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Dark Elves&lt;/a&gt; to conduct a scouting mission and try to determine if the return of the Psijics and the opening of the Clockwork City have any connection. It could be that something significant is brewing at a level well beyond our mortals concerns.\nI will return as soon as I am able.\nAdvisor Penewen"}

Few lectures are focused on them, few books are written. Why are these machines, so vital to the everyday processes of our existence, so ignored?\nFactotums are an invention of need, servants of brass created by Lord &lt;a href=\"Seht\"&gt;Seht&lt;/a&gt; to maintain his great creation, the Clockwork City. Repair factotums may keep our many factories and functions running. Guard factotums secure the locations of our god's most dangerous secrets. By their metal hands our homes are kept clean, our food is served, and music flows throughout our streets. But how much do we truly know about the factotums which we work so closely with?\nThe answer lies in the mysterious nature of the factotums. Though our doctrines speak of mysteries, their importance and their prominence, they are still something we seek to solve. A formula, a theory, an answer which can be replicated again and again. That is what Clockwork Apostles seek with their fields of studies, for why strive for innovation when there are simply no discoveries to be found?\nWhat we do know is that the factotums have a common appearance, voice, and sense of purpose. They hold a structured intelligence, often centered on their singular function. Their dialogue and actions are all based on this function, with only the commonality of a devotion to the Clockwork God. Attempts to deviate from this purpose is simply incomprehensible to them.\nAny further research factotums is constantly met with opposition. Their place of creation is heavily guarded. Their functions severely limit the amount of information they can give about themselves. We don't know which manner or magic or machinery goes into their creation and that's exactly why we need to further our research on them!\nI seek to delve into the secrets of perhaps the most enigmatic of Lord Seht's creations. My research's focus will center on the structure, functions, and true purpose of these seemingly straightforwards machines. I shall finally gain insight into what is perhaps the greatest mystery in all of Clockwork City."}

Read on, for this great mystery at last has a solution!\nTales of gargoyles are widespread across &lt;a href=\"Tamriel\"&gt;Tamriel&lt;/a&gt;, but few can claim to have actually seen one. (Have you ever seen one? Has anyone you know ever seen one? I didn't think so. And I'm rarely wrong about such things. As you know if you've read my other pamphlets. If you haven't read my other pamphlets you are sadly under-informed, and have missed out on several life-changing money-making opportunities. You would be wise to correct this deficiency.)\nBut back to the business at hand: gargoyles! They're few and far between. However, it is well known that they can be found deep in the depths of the deserts of Hammerfell, hunkering atop crumbling crags as they gaze balefully down upon their potential prey, preparing to dive and rend it with their stony, taloned hands! Is it any wonder few have survived to tell of such an encounter?\nAt any event: &lt;a href=\"Hammerfell%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Hammerfell&lt;/a&gt;, depths of the deserts thereof, that's where we find our elusive gargoyles! But gargoyles are not the only legendary denizens of the depths of the deserts, are they? No! In fact, according to long-time Redguard legend, when those doughty warriors first arrived on the shores of Tamriel they found the deserts of Hammerfell occupied by\u2014Giant Goblins!\nGiant &lt;a href=\"Goblin%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Goblins&lt;/a&gt;! Goblins, but giant-sized! In other words: great misshapen humanoids, gray-green of skin, with gnarled, tusked faces, horns, and pointed ears. Where have we heard that before \u2026?\nRevelation! Epiphany! You get it, do you not? Take a look at a Goblin, then look at a gargoyle\u2014very well, look at a picture of a gargoyle, because as I believe we've established none of us have ever seen one in person\u2014but anyway, just look at them! Can such a resemblance be a coincidence? Well, I don't know about you, but my mother didn't raise anyone that gullible! Coincidence? My eye! It's as plain as their tusky faces that the Hammerfell Giant Goblins (legendary) and the Hammerfell gargoyles (a matter of public record) are, in point of fact, One And The Same. Why, a fool couldn't tell them apart, blindfolded."}

Unfortunately, however, not everything that comes from the sea can be considered beneficial, and there exists many seaborne threats that pose a significant danger to the island. We here in the &lt;a href=\"College%20of%20Sapiarchs\"&gt;College of Sapiarchs&lt;/a&gt; have deemed the level of danger high enough that we have devoted an entire field of study to help research and formulate countermeasures, hence my appointment to the post of Sapiarch of Aquatic Malevolence.\nThreats from the sea appear in many different forms, from natural events to enemy kingdoms. Nature has a way of letting the island know that even the magical protections provided by the &lt;a href=\"Crystal%20Tower%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Crystal Tower&lt;/a&gt; aren't always enough to stop a destructive storm, crashing waves, or flood waters from damaging Summerset. As far as enemies are concerned, the Royal Navy keeps the sea lanes as clear as possible and serves as a deterrent to the forces of the other alliances. The exception to this remains the various factions of the &lt;a href=\"Maormer\"&gt;Maormer&lt;/a&gt;\u2014the Sea Elves\u2014who fearlessly slip past patrols to raid coastal settlements on a regular basis.\nProbably the most fearsome potential threat appears in the form of the &lt;a href=\"Sload\"&gt;Sload&lt;/a&gt;. Even though these vile creatures from the southwestern &lt;a href=\"Abecean%20Sea%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Abecean Sea&lt;/a&gt; were much more ambitious in their attempts to conquer Summerset in centuries past, the residents of the coral kingdoms of &lt;a href=\"Thras\"&gt;Thras&lt;/a&gt; continue to pillage and raid our holdings to the current day. The amphibious, slug-like beings have an affinity for magic, though they seem more drawn to dark magic than to anything positive or beneficial. They deal in necromancy, plagues, and other instruments of death and destruction.\nRecent rumors heard across the island suggest that a particular type of Sload, the &lt;a href=\"Sea%20Sload\"&gt;Sea Sload&lt;/a&gt;, have returned to trouble Summerset. While they haven't been seen or heard from in centuries, the Sea Sloads rule the undersea kingdom of &lt;a href=\"Ul%27vor%20Kus\"&gt;Ul'vor Kus&lt;/a&gt;, located somewhere in the &lt;a href=\"Sea%20of%20Pearls\"&gt;Sea of Pearls&lt;/a&gt;. Even the possibility that such creatures have infiltrated the island is cause for concern and utmost diligence. To this end, I have consulted old tomes and ancient volumes contained within our extensive libraries to gather whatever information I can. I'm sorry to say, it isn't much. The Sea Sloads are even more reclusive and mysterious than their more numerous cousins.\nWhat I could uncover indicates that we should not underestimate the threat the Sea Sloads pose. Instead of organizing themselves in small kingdoms, as the &lt;a href=\"Thras%20Sload\"&gt;Thras Sload&lt;/a&gt; are wont to do, the Sea Sloads form cabals of small numbers of like-minded individuals who cooperate to attain some specific goal. Then the cabals break up, reform, and reorganize as interests and necessity warrant. While Sea Sloads have as much interest in necromancy as any other Sloads, they also demonstrate skill in &lt;a href=\"Alchemy%20%28Online%29\"&gt;alchemy&lt;/a&gt;, shadow magic, and mind magic, among other arcane disciplines. For all their ambition and power, however, our records indicate that the Sea Sloads may in fact be on the verge of extinction. My predecessor, &lt;a href=\"Winawen\"&gt;Winawen&lt;/a&gt;, certainly wrote as much in her seminal work, \"The Villains of Ul'Vor Kus.\" It was her educated opinion that the Sea Sloads would naturally disappear within a few centuries. Such an event cannot occur soon enough.\nUntil confirmation of Sea Sload activity on Summerset is verified, I suggest we remain vigilant and watch the sea. Besides the Sea Sloads themselves, these arrogant and unfriendly creatures have been known to utilize all kinds of terrible sea monsters. The last thing the island needs in these turbulent times is attacks by creatures from the sea."}

Inland, &lt;a href=\"the%20Crowns\"&gt;the Crowns&lt;/a&gt; still held much of the power and strongly adhered to the ancient Yokudan tenets.\nDespite this fanatical veneration, much Yokudan knowledge was lost to time and feuds between the factions.

It hung from nothing in the air.\nSome kind of procession followed, of all kinds of &lt;a href=\"Daedra%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Daedric&lt;/a&gt; creatures, towards the Keep. They walked straight through pools of lava. Some couldn't survive the heat, but they marched on, burning and crackling as they went, prostrating themselves at the feet of that celestial object. There, they smoldered like a hundred miniature suns until they were no longer there. Days ago, this would have pleased me, but I believe these creatures do not wholly perish. I have seen too many of the same faces after I have smashed them, over and over again.\nThen came the &lt;a href=\"Daedric%20Titan%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Titan&lt;/a&gt;, landing in a crushing mass, and with it a rain of fire so fierce I swear the cave mouth, where I stood watching above, burned wider. I withdrew into darkness for a desperate pause, thinking my end had come. When it didn't, I emerged to find the Titan hunched to the ground, the ruby carbuncles on its hide flaring an angry red. It stared up, almost defiantly, at the being of ash and fire and slag, and a plume of smoke issued from the holes in its skull.\nI thought a blazing spell was coming, but the Titan only raised its head to lower it again. In deference? Begrudging respect? It was only then that the molten god\u2014whatever it was\u2014touched the dirt with its feet."}

Or, more specifically, when and how the Dark Brotherhood split from the Morag Tong, as the former is widely accepted to have sprung from the latter.\nThe largest point of contention seems to be the figure of the &lt;a href=\"Night%20Mother\"&gt;Night Mother&lt;/a&gt;, a woman who figures prominently in both organizations. Through extensive research and interviews, and not inconsiderable risk to my own life (for the Dark Brotherhood holds this information sacred), I have finally solved this ages-old mystery. I have finally uncovered the Night Mother's Truth.\nAlthough her name has been lost to time, the Night Mother was once a mere mortal, a &lt;a href=\"Dunmer\"&gt;Dark Elf&lt;/a&gt; woman who lived in a small village once located where the city of &lt;a href=\"Bravil\"&gt;Bravil&lt;/a&gt; stands now, in the Imperial Province of &lt;a href=\"Cyrodiil\"&gt;Cyrodiil&lt;/a&gt;. She was a respected member of the Morag Tong and, like her fellow members, this woman made her trade as an assassin in service of the &lt;a href=\"Daedric%20Prince\"&gt;Daedric Prince&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Mephala\"&gt;Mephala&lt;/a&gt;. In fact, the woman held the title of Night Mother, reserved for the highest ranking female member of the organization. To be Night Mother of a particular sect was to be that group's matron - the favored of Mephala, both respected and feared.\nHowever, it was not Mephala who facilitated the transformation from woman to spectre, but another, some would say far deeper form of evil - &lt;a href=\"Sithis\"&gt;Sithis&lt;/a&gt;, the Dread Lord, embodiment of the unending &lt;a href=\"Void\"&gt;Void&lt;/a&gt;.\nFollowing the &lt;a href=\"Versidue%20Shaie\"&gt;Potentate's&lt;/a&gt; assassination in &lt;a href=\"2E%20324\"&gt;2E 324&lt;/a&gt;, strife descended upon the Morag Tong, and the guild was all but eradicated in Cyrodiil and much of the &lt;a href=\"Empire%20of%20Tamriel\"&gt;Empire&lt;/a&gt;. It was shortly after these events that the Dunmer woman claimed to hear the voice of Sithis himself. The Dread Lord, she claimed, was displeased. He was unhappy with the Morag Tong's lack of success. The Void, he told her, was hungry for souls - and it was her destiny to set things right.\nAnd so, according to Dark Brotherhood legend, Sithis visited the Night Mother in her bed chamber, and begat her five children. Two years passed, before the unthinkable happened. The Dark Elf woman followed through the Dread Lord's ultimate plan - one night, she murdered her children, and sent their souls straight to the Void. Straight to their father.\nWhen they learned of this affront to decency, the people of the village rallied against the woman. For such an act was considered incomprehensible, even for the Night Mother of the Morag Tong. In one night of vengeance, they descended upon the woman, killing her, and burning down the house in which the atrocity took place. And that was the end of the story. Or so everyone thought.\nA little more than thirty years later, an unarmed man heard a strange, comforting voice inside his very head, just as the Dunmer woman claimed to hear the voice of Sithis inside hers. The voice identified herself as the Night Mother, and named the man \"&lt;a href=\"Listener\"&gt;Listener&lt;/a&gt;\" - the first of many.\nAnd so the Unholy Matron set her servant on his path - he would found a new organization, a guild of assassins known as the Dark Brotherhood, in service not to Mephala, but to the Dread Lord Sithis. The Morag Tong, now surviving only in Morrowind, was an artifact of forgotten age. The Dark Brotherhood would marry business with death. The organization would grow in wealth and power, and the Void would swell with fresh souls. It was, the Night Mother told her Listener, the perfect arrangement.\nIn the early days of the Dark Brotherhood, the bodies of the Night Mother and her children were recovered from their original burial site, and interred in a crypt beneath the site of her house. And there they remain, even today.\nSo if, in your travels, you find yourself in the city of Bravil, and make a wish at the state of the &lt;a href=\"Lucky%20Old%20Lady\"&gt;Lucky Old Lady&lt;/a&gt; (as is the local custom), know that you stand on sacred, if evil, ground. For you stand above the Night Mother, the Unholy Matron herself, and your luck has just run out."}

If one day the Nightingales should vanish from &lt;a href=\"Tamriel\"&gt;Tamriel&lt;/a&gt;, then let this tome serve as a reminder of what we once were and to dispel any rumor or hearsay about our purposes and our motivations.\nOur trinity serves the Lady &lt;a href=\"Nocturnal\"&gt;Nocturnal&lt;/a&gt;, the Empress of Murk and the Daughter of Twilight. We believe her to be our patron, if not the patron of all thieves worldwide. We serve her without prayer, without charity and without celebration. Our bond with Nocturnal is in the form of a business transaction we strike known as the Oath. Her terms are simple and binding. As Nightingales we are required to guard the &lt;a href=\"Twilight%20Sepulcher\"&gt;Twilight Sepulcher&lt;/a&gt;, the Temple of Nocturnal, against those perceived as a threat. In return, we are allowed to use our abilities as Nightingales to further our own means and the means of the &lt;a href=\"Thieves%20Guild%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Thieves Guild&lt;/a&gt;.\nUpon our death, we are bound to the Twilight Sepulcher as guardian spirits until such time as Nocturnal feels our contract has been fulfilled. Our ultimate fate lies within the &lt;a href=\"Evergloam\"&gt;Evergloam&lt;/a&gt;, Nocturnal's realm. There, our spirits become one with shadow itself and we become the cloak which envelops all of our fellow thieves in their endeavors. This is the true origin of the phrase \"walk with the shadows\" uttered within the Thieves Guild.\nThe Twilight Sepulcher is more than a temple, it contains a conduit from our world to the Evergloam, a swirling pool of liquid midnight we call the &lt;a href=\"Ebonmere\"&gt;Ebonmere&lt;/a&gt;. This is the heart of the Sepulcher, and the source of Nocturnal's influence throughout the world. The Ebonmere can only be sealed by removing a unique key from its lock. This key, which occasionally finds its way beyond the walls of the Sepulcher, is widely known as the &lt;a href=\"Skeleton%20Key%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Skeleton Key&lt;/a&gt; of Nocturnal.\nThe Skeleton Key is an often misunderstood artifact. Those that seek to possess it tend to use only a fraction of its potential. Most mistake it for a unique and unbreakable lockpick. While this is true, the wonder of this device can only be appreciated once the owner is willing to expand his mind and abstract what defines \"unlocking.\" This action refers to more than simple doors and portals. In the proper hands, the Skeleton Key has the capability to unlock hidden potential and untapped abilities. The extent of this power has yet to be discovered, which is a frightening thought if it ever fell into the wrong hands.\nAs a member of the trinity of Nightingales, it is incumbent upon us to recover the Skeleton Key if it strays from the Twilight Sepulcher. Why Nocturnal allows the Key to be stolen in the first place is a mystery. Some say she revels in the chaos this artifact causes, others feel she simply does not care, that the petty squabbles of &lt;a href=\"men\"&gt;men&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"mer\"&gt;mer&lt;/a&gt; are beyond her attention. Whatever the case may be, it is our duty to ensure it remains safely within the confines of the Sepulcher.\nTo say that the Nightingales are a holy order would be doing us a disservice. In our hearts, we are thieves. We enjoy the hunt and delight in the spoils. We might swear our loyalty to Nocturnal and hold some influence within the Thieves Guild, but the greatest allegiance a Nightingale holds is to himself."}

If one day the Nightingales should vanish from &lt;a href=\"Tamriel\"&gt;Tamriel&lt;/a&gt;, then let this tome serve as a reminder of what we once were and to dispel any rumor or hearsay about our purposes and our motivations.\nI will attempt to relate the scant bit of knowledge I have of our history to the best of my ability. It is my hope that in the future, someone else may happen upon this writing and amend it in order to expand the record of our existence.\nOur history begins with a well-known tale. The tome \"&lt;a href=\"The%20Real%20Barenziah%2C%20Book%20IV\"&gt;The Real Barenziah IX&lt;/a&gt;\" (sic) mentions that a bard named \"Nightingale\" tricked &lt;a href=\"Barenziah\"&gt;Queen Barenziah&lt;/a&gt; into revealing the location of an artifact called the &lt;a href=\"Staff%20of%20Chaos\"&gt;Staff of Chaos&lt;/a&gt; which he later claimed for his own. The story goes on to reveal that \"Nightingale\" was a powerful &lt;a href=\"Imperial%20Battlemage\"&gt;Imperial Battlemage&lt;/a&gt; named &lt;a href=\"Jagar%20Tharn\"&gt;Jagar Tharn&lt;/a&gt; in disguise and that he used the Staff to imprison Emperor &lt;a href=\"Uriel%20Septim%20VII\"&gt;Uriel Septim VII&lt;/a&gt;. His ultimate goal was to assume the form of the banished emperor and &lt;a href=\"Imperial%20Simulacrum\"&gt;sit upon the throne&lt;/a&gt; in his stead.\nIn actuality, the individual identified as \"the bard Nightingale\" was not Jagar Tharn at all. This master of disguise was a Nightingale thief named &lt;a href=\"Drayven%20Indoril\"&gt;Drayven Indoril&lt;/a&gt;. Jagar Tharn hired Drayven, one of the greatest master thieves in &lt;a href=\"Skyrim\"&gt;Skyrim&lt;/a&gt;, to seduce Barenziah and coerce her into revealing the location of the Staff of Chaos. After the Staff was given to Jagar Tharn, he attempted to eradicate Drayven, but his Nightingale abilities aided his escape. Jagar Tharn searched for Drayven but eventually had to abandon the pursuit in order to enact his plans involving the emperor.\nIt is interesting to note that history refers to Jagar Tharn as \"Nightingale\" well after the point Drayven would have vanished from the story. The distortion of actual events is very typical of Barenziah's manipulation. With the pressure of blame falling squarely on her shoulders for Uriel Septim VII's imprisonment, she twisted the truth and created the notion that the \"bard\" named Nightingale was Jagar Tharn himself. She felt the tale of being enthralled by the master sorcerer held more of a forgiving if not romantic notion than simply being seduced by a master rogue. Some also further speculate that eliminating Drayven from history was her attempt at protecting the reputation of Jagar Tharn, whom she was rumored to have been quite fond of.\nDrayven had escaped into &lt;a href=\"Morrowind\"&gt;Morrowind&lt;/a&gt; after Jagar Tharn's pursuit and rejoined the &lt;a href=\"House%20Indoril\"&gt;Indoril family&lt;/a&gt; who held an estate quite close to the border of Skyrim which allowed him to perform his Nightingale duties at the &lt;a href=\"Twilight%20Sepulcher\"&gt;Sepulcher&lt;/a&gt; if the need arose. He remained there for many years until the Indoril family began to lose its power and a war between the houses erupted. Not wanting any part of it, and feeling that Jagar Tharn was no longer a threat, Drayven left his homeland behind and settled in &lt;a href=\"The%20Rift%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;The Rift&lt;/a&gt; under the guise of a miner.\nCo-currently with Drayven's history, born out of Dravyen's seduction of Barenziah, the Dunmer Queen eventually bore a child. This child, whom Barenziah abandoned with a midwife in an attempt to keep her Nightingale story valid, eventually grew into adulthood and struck out on her own to find her father. Calling herself &lt;a href=\"Dralsi%20Indoril\"&gt;Dralsi&lt;/a&gt;, she overturned every stone in Skyrim looking for any traces of Drayven. After an unknown number of years passed, she finally located him in a small mining community called &lt;a href=\"Shor%27s%20Stone%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Shor's Stone&lt;/a&gt;. He was quite elderly now... no longer the spry rogue that had seduced Barenziah, but nevertheless he was still Dralsi's father and he treated her as such. In the remaining years of Drayven's life, he imparted the ways of the Nightingale to Dralsi until he finally succumbed to his age.\nDralsi willingly struck the Oath of the Nightingales and performed her duties well in the service of &lt;a href=\"Nocturnal\"&gt;Nocturnal&lt;/a&gt;. She eventually took a husband and together they had a child whom they named &lt;a href=\"Karliah\"&gt;Karliah&lt;/a&gt;. Like Dralsi's father did for her, Dralsi taught Karliah the art of thievery and how to survive in Skyrim living as a rogue. She intended to pass the Nightingale mantle on to Karliah, but had to wait until the time was right to reveal it. When she was old enough, Karliah struck out on her own wanting to ply her trade in a larger city. She eventually found her way to Riften and joined the &lt;a href=\"Thieves%20Guild%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Thieves Guild&lt;/a&gt; under my own leadership at the time.\nAs Karliah slowly climbed the ranks in the Guild, I watched her progress and saw much of her mother in her methods. After several years passed, I received word that Dralsi had been killed defending the Twilight Sepulcher from a band of mercenaries and so it became time for the mantle to be passed. I traveled to &lt;a href=\"Nightingale%20Hall\"&gt;Nightingale Hall&lt;/a&gt; with &lt;a href=\"Mercer%20Frey\"&gt;Mercer Frey&lt;/a&gt; and together, we inducted Karliah into the Nightingales.\nI will relate my own history in my next volume and perhaps, as I uncover more information, the history of Mercer Frey as well."}

It is a revised version of an earlier missive Sinderion gave to the same group several years before. We've done the best we could to preserve the original tone of his speech, but some light embellishments have been made for editorial reasons and for clarity.\n&lt;a href=\"Sharmirin%20Raythorne\"&gt;Sharmirin Raythorne&lt;/a&gt;,\nImperial Scribe\nI would like to address the Symposium today with some startling revelations regarding the &lt;a href=\"Nirnroot%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;nirnroot&lt;/a&gt;.\nAlthough this curiously tenacious flora grows almost anywhere a significant body of water is present, it's extremely rare, and soon to become extinct. After years of extensive research, and the tireless efforts of my field assistant, I came into the possession of a large sampling of nirnroot. According to the theories presented by the noted Imperial Herbalist &lt;a href=\"Chivius%20Regelliam\"&gt;Chivius Regelliam&lt;/a&gt;, the nirnroot once flourished until a cataclysmic event severely reduced their numbers. Although many scholars reject the proposal that the &lt;a href=\"Sun%27s%20Death\"&gt;Sun's Death&lt;/a&gt; event of &lt;a href=\"1E%20668\"&gt;1E 668&lt;/a&gt; catastrophically affected plant life, Chivius felt that the nirnroot's normal growth cycle was interrupted by the lack of sun for a full year. Whereas other plant species tend to \"find a way,\" the nirnroot's mysterious magical nature made it especially susceptible to this climate shift. While this may or may not be the case, it's certainly true that the recorded sightings of nirnroot are declining as the years pass\nChivius's notes oddly describe the nirnroot as emitting a \"brilliant, yellowish glow.\" Contrary to this, the nirnroot of today has a soft, haunting blue-white glow. Subsequent studies by other scholars have failed to adequately explain this shift in hue. I propose that the nirnroot sensed its own impending extinction and therefore altered its metabolism in order to survive. One of the most glaring pieces of evidence of my theory is the presence of nirnroot in subterranean environments... places completely devoid of sunlight. Strangely, Chivius's notes fail to mention even a single instance of a subterrestrial nirnroot. How could this be? How could a surface-dwelling plant suddenly begin appearing in new locations radically different from its normal habitat?\nThe answer, my fellow alchemists, is ironically concealed within Chivius's own notes. Although he spends a great deal of time experimenting with the nirnroot in his laboratory, he overlooked an important part of a plant's growth cycle... its soil. Chivius was correct in assuming the volcanic eruption of Red Mountain contributed to the demise of the nirnroot, but I believe the ash from that mighty explosion did more than simply cloud the skies. When mixed with the fertile soil of Cyrodiil, this fine powder is the true cause of the nirnroot's astounding metamorphosis. Although little volcanic ash from that dark time remains, I have performed tests on samples sent to me from &lt;a href=\"Vvardenfell\"&gt;Vvardenfell&lt;/a&gt;. Careful scrutiny of the samples revealed that they were rife with \"ash salt,\" a highly magical substance. Dunmer native to the Vvardenfell region were known to have used ash salt as an ingredient to cure the \"&lt;a href=\"Blight\"&gt;Blight&lt;/a&gt;,\" an awful &lt;a href=\"Diseases%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;disease&lt;/a&gt; which decimated their realm hundreds of years ago. This unique property of the ash salt coupled with the nirnroot's inherent magic caused the radical change... in essence; the root \"healed itself.\"\nIn summation, it's clear that the nirnroot was dying and used a byproduct of its destructor to preserve itself. I feel the nirnroot has accomplished in a relatively short amount of time what it would take other species thousands of years to complete.\nWhether you subscribe to my theory or not, one thing is certain; the nirnroot is on a path to destruction. It contains untapped potential to create potions the likes of which have never been seen in our day. I propose to you today that we divert a small portion of our funds to an expedition to collect some of these roots to study. I have outlined this proposal for your perusal after this section of the Symposium. Please, seriously consider this proposal before it becomes too late, and the nirnroot becomes nothing but a memory.\nThank you for your time."}

Art by Adam Adamowicz.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Et%27Ada\"&gt;gods&lt;/a&gt; are cyclical, just like the &lt;a href=\"Nirn\"&gt;world&lt;/a&gt; is. There are the Dead Gods, who fought and died to bring about the new cycle; the Hearth Gods, who watch over the present cycle; the Testing Gods, who threaten the Hearth and thus are watched; and the Twilight Gods, who usher in the next cycle. The end of a cycle is said to be preceded by the Dragonborn God, a god that did not exist in the previous cycle but whose presence means that the current one is almost over.\nThe Dead Gods.\nDead Gods don\u2019t need temples. They have the biggest one of all, . &lt;a href=\"Nord\"&gt;Nord&lt;/a&gt; heroes and clever men visit the Underworld all the time. They bear a symbol to show that they have, which garners much respect.\nThe Hearth Gods.\nThe Hearth Gods have temples appropriate to their nature: &lt;a href=\"Kyne\"&gt;Kyne&lt;/a&gt;\u2019s are built on peaks, &lt;a href=\"Mara\"&gt;Mara&lt;/a&gt;\u2019s are the halls of important &lt;a href=\"Witch\"&gt;Witches&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Dibella\"&gt;Dibella&lt;/a&gt;\u2019s are the halls of important Wives\u2013 the temples aren\u2019t like those of the &lt;a href=\"Imperials\"&gt;Imperials&lt;/a&gt;; as Hearth Gods, they are always homes to someone, and the highest-ranking female of that home is their de facto high priestess.\nThe Testing Gods.\nThe Testing Gods don\u2019t really have temples \u2013 they are propitiated at battlegrounds or other sites where they caused some notable trouble. Nords understand that the &lt;a href=\"Daedric\"&gt;Daedric&lt;/a&gt; Temples are something else entirely and think them as much of a waste of time as the formalized religion of the &lt;a href=\"Nine%20Divines\"&gt;Nine Divines&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"Cyrodiil\"&gt;Cyrodiil&lt;/a&gt;.\n\"The Woodland Man, &lt;a href=\"Hermaeus%20Mora\"&gt;Herma Mora&lt;/a&gt;\"\nThe Twilight Gods.\nThe Twilight Gods need no temples\u2013 when they show up, there won\u2019t be any reason to build them, much less use them \u2013 another waste of time. That said, Nords do venerate them, as they always venerate the cycles of things, and especially the Last War where they will show their final, best worth.\nAlduin is venerated on the winter solstice by ceremonies at ancient &lt;a href=\"Dragon%20Cult\"&gt;Dragon Cult&lt;/a&gt; temples, where offerings are made to keep him asleep for one more year. Alduin is also the source of many common superstitious practices before any event of significance.\n\"The &lt;a href=\"Dragonborn%20%28Lore%29\"&gt;Dragonborn&lt;/a&gt; God, &lt;a href=\"Talos\"&gt;Talos&lt;/a&gt;\"\nTalos\u2019 totem is the newest, but is everywhere \u2013 he is the Dragonborn Conquering Son, the first new god of this cycle, whose power is consequently unknown, so the Nords bless nearly everything with his totem, since he might very well be the god of it now, too. Yes, as first of the Twilight Gods, this practice might seem contradictory, but that\u2019s only because, of all the gods, he will be the one that survives in whole into the next cycle.\nNord view of &lt;a href=\"Imperial%20Pantheon\"&gt;Imperial Religion&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Eight%20Divines\"&gt;Eight Divines&lt;/a&gt; are viewed by the Nords as a \u201cSouthern\u201d import. They retain some of the taint of the &lt;a href=\"Alessian%20Order\"&gt;Alessian Order&lt;/a&gt;, and are basically viewed as a religion for foreigners. Their gods are fine for them, but Nords need Nord gods.\nSome of the gods are the same (or similar) \u2013 significantly these are the three female gods, which are far more important to the Nords than they are in the &lt;a href=\"Imperial%20Cult\"&gt;Imperial Cult&lt;/a&gt;. (Kyne is in fact the de facto head of the Nord pantheon.) The Nords are perplexed and disturbed by the Imperial Cult\u2019s focus on &lt;a href=\"Akatosh\"&gt;the Dragon God&lt;/a&gt; \u2013 they regard this as a fundamental misunderstanding of the universe, and one likely to cause disaster in the end. (Which fits perfectly with the pessimistic Nord view of the world in general \u2013 things are likely to turn out badly, and it will probably be caused by some foreigner.) Lucky for the world that the Nords are so diligent about keeping Alduin asleep, while the southerners are busy trying to get his attention! Any mention of Akatosh in a Nord\u2019s presence is likely to bring a muttered invocation to Alduin to stay asleep in response.\nThe Nords believe that, During the &lt;a href=\"Oblivion%20Crisis\"&gt;Oblivion Crisis&lt;/a&gt;, it was Talos (Dragonborn, &lt;a href=\"Martin%20Septim\"&gt;Martin&lt;/a&gt;\u2019s forefather) lending his aid, not Alduin."}

{"id": "54503", "revid": "32045548", "url": "https://elderscrolls.fandom.com/wiki?curid=54503", "title": "The Oblivion Crisis", "text": "The Oblivion Crisis is a &lt;a href=\"Books%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;book&lt;/a&gt; in .\nContents.\n\"At the turning of the &lt;a href=\"Fourth%20Age\"&gt;Fourth Age&lt;/a&gt;, in the year &lt;a href=\"3E%20433\"&gt;3E 433&lt;/a&gt;, the Emperor &lt;a href=\"Uriel%20Septim%20VII\"&gt;Uriel Septim VII&lt;/a&gt; was assassinated and the &lt;a href=\"Amulet%20of%20Kings\"&gt;Amulet of Kings&lt;/a&gt; was destroyed. This set in motion a chain of events that would bring down an empire and change forever the relationship between man and the gods.\nThe assassins first attacked the Emperor in the &lt;a href=\"White-Gold%20Tower\"&gt;White-Gold Tower&lt;/a&gt;. While the &lt;a href=\"Blades\"&gt;Blades&lt;/a&gt; held them back, the Emperor made his way down to the dungeons, to a secret escape route built into one of the prison cells. For reasons known only to himself, the Emperor pardoned the fortunate prisoner in that cell. Some say the prisoner reminded him of a childhood friend. Others say it was a moment of prophecy. Whatever the case, the prisoner came to play a fateful role in the history of the Empire and &lt;a href=\"Tamriel\"&gt;Tamriel&lt;/a&gt; - surely a sign that the gods themselves were at work.\nThe pursuing assassins killed the Blades bodyguards in a relentless series of sneak attacks. Eventually they struck down the Emperor himself. Before he fell, Uriel Septim VII gave the Amulet of Kings to the prisoner, who somehow made it out of the &lt;a href=\"Imperial%20City%20Sewers%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;Imperial Sewers&lt;/a&gt; and into the light of day.\nThe assassination is now known to have been the work of a group of daedric cultists known as the &lt;a href=\"Mythic%20Dawn\"&gt;Mythic Dawn&lt;/a&gt;. (Those who still suspect the &lt;a href=\"Dark%20Brotherhood\"&gt;Dark Brotherhood&lt;/a&gt; should consider two facts: first, they would have only needed a single assassin, not a small army of them; second, the Dark Brotherhood would never be so foolish as to effectively declare war on the &lt;a href=\"Empire\"&gt;Empire&lt;/a&gt; and thus ensure their complete destruction. Witness to the eventual fate of the Mythic Dawn.)\nThe Amulet of Kings next surfaced at the &lt;a href=\"Weynon%20Priory%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;Weynon Priory&lt;/a&gt; near &lt;a href=\"Chorrol\"&gt;Chorrol&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href=\"Jauffre%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;Jauffre&lt;/a&gt;, secret Grandmaster of the Blades and head of the priory, took possession of the amulet. The messenger was set off to &lt;a href=\"Kvatch%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;Kvatch&lt;/a&gt; to find a lowly priest named &lt;a href=\"Martin%20Septim%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;Martin Septim&lt;/a&gt;. Unbeknownst even to himself, Martin was the bastard son of Uriel Septim VII, and the last heir to the Ruby Throne. He alone could use the Amulet of Kings to light the &lt;a href=\"Dragonfires\"&gt;Dragonfires&lt;/a&gt; that wards the barrier between Tamriel and &lt;a href=\"Oblivion%20%28Realm%29\"&gt;Oblivion&lt;/a&gt;, and save the world from the Mythic Dawn plot.\nThe prisoner arrived at Kvatch to find it overrun by &lt;a href=\"Daedra\"&gt;Daedra&lt;/a&gt; that had poured in from a newly-opened &lt;a href=\"Oblivion%20Gate\"&gt;Oblivion Gate&lt;/a&gt;, the start of the Empire-spanning devastation of the &lt;a href=\"Oblivion%20Crisis\"&gt;Oblivion Crisis&lt;/a&gt;. How the prisoner closed the gate is not recorded. Once closed, Martin and the surviving Kvatch guardsmen drove back the daedra.\nNow known as the &lt;a href=\"Hero%20of%20Kvatch\"&gt;Hero of Kvatch&lt;/a&gt;, the prisoner and Martin returned to Weynon Priory, only to find the priory sacked and the Amulet taken. Jauffre survived the attack, however, and the three of them made their way to &lt;a href=\"Cloud%20Ruler%20Temple%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;Cloud Ruler Temple&lt;/a&gt;, bastion of the Blades. This secret fortress in the mountains outside &lt;a href=\"Bruma%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;Bruma&lt;/a&gt; is where Martin was held safe while the Hero of Kvatch searched for the lost Amulet.\nKnowing only that a mysterious group called the Mythic Dawn was behind the assassination and thief of the Amulet, the Hero of Kvatch was sent to locate the cult. With the help of &lt;a href=\"Baurus\"&gt;Baurus&lt;/a&gt;, a Blade in service of the Emperor, they somehow used the Commentaries on the &lt;a href=\"Mysterium%20Xarxes\"&gt;Mysterium Xarxes&lt;/a&gt;, esoteric works by the madman &lt;a href=\"Mankar%20Camoran%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;Mankar Camoran&lt;/a&gt;, to direct them to the Mythic Dawn's secret Lair. Scholars familiar with the Commentaries claim the location is not directly mentioned in them. How they did this remains a mystery. No official records exist of how the Hero of Kvatch penetrated the Mythic Dawn's lair near &lt;a href=\"Lake%20Arrius\"&gt;Lake Arrius&lt;/a&gt;. There is a bardic tale that claims the Hero used trickery and disguise, but that is just was discovered there is that Mankar Camoran was behind the Mythic Dawn, and that the group the daedric prince &lt;a href=\"Mehrunes%20Dagon\"&gt;Mehrunes Dagon&lt;/a&gt;. Mankar Camoran believed himself to be a direct descendant of the &lt;a href=\"Camoran%20Usurper\"&gt;Camoran Usurper&lt;/a&gt;, the infamous pretender to the throne of &lt;a href=\"Valenwood\"&gt;Valenwood&lt;/a&gt;.\nSomehow the hero escaped with the Mysterium Xarxes itself, the holy book of the Mythic Dawn cult. Mankar Camoran fled to Oblivion with the Amulet of Kings. With some effort and great risk to his sanity, Martin deciphered the Mysterium Xarxes and intended to use it to open a gateway to Mankar Camoran in order to recover the Amulet of Kings.\nBefore Martin could do the ritual to open the gateway, Mehrunes Dagon opened an Oblivion Gate outside Bruma. the Hero of Kvatch saved the city and Martin by entering the gate and closing it before a daedric siege engine could destroy Bruma and the Cloud Ruler Temple. Many songs and stories have been told of this battle and I will not retell them here. The Hero of Kvatch was now known as the &lt;a href=\"Hero%20of%20Kvatch\"&gt;Savior of Bruma&lt;/a&gt;.\nWith the city and Cloud Ruler Temple safe, Martin opened the portal to Mankar Camoran's \"Paradise\". The detail of what transpired in this place have not been recorded. All that is known is that the Savior of Bruma traveled to this Paradise, killed Mankar Camoran, and returned with the Amulet of Kings.\nWith the Amulet in hand, Martin Septim presented himself to the &lt;a href=\"Elder%20Council\"&gt;Elder Council&lt;/a&gt; to be crowned Emperor of all Tamriel. Once crowned he planned to relight the Dragonfires and seal Tamriel from Oblivion. In a last-ditch attempt to stop him, Mehrunes Dagon launched an assault on the &lt;a href=\"Imperial%20City\"&gt;Imperial City&lt;/a&gt;, opening several Oblivion Gates within the capital itself. Uncrowned, Martin joined the battle in the city streets.\nMehrunes Dagon himself left Oblivion and entered Tamriel, breaking the covenant. Only the unlit Dragonfires allowed this to be possible. Now that the barrier was ripped asunder, it was too late to the Fires. Martin Septim chose to make the ultimate sacrifice - he shattered the Amulet of Kings to become the avatar of the god &lt;a href=\"Akatosh\"&gt;Akatosh&lt;/a&gt; and do battle with Mehrunes Dagon.\nRecords of this battle vary wildly. What we do know is that Mehrunes Dagon was defeated and sent back into Oblivion. The avatar of Akatosh was turned to stone and can be seen to this day in the &lt;a href=\"Temple%20of%20the%20One\"&gt;Temple of the One&lt;/a&gt; in the Imperial City. With the Amulet gone, the Dragonfires quenched, and the last &lt;a href=\"Martin%20Septim\"&gt;Dragonblood Emperor&lt;/a&gt; dead, the barrier to Oblivion is sealed forever."}

A powerful &lt;a href=\"Vampire%20Lord\"&gt;Vampire Lord&lt;/a&gt;, Harkon rules his brood with an iron fist. He will stop at nothing to achieve his goals, even if it means the estrangement of his own family. Harkon is one of the few individuals in Tamriel capable of granting pure-blood vampirism.\nBackground.\nIf asked about how he got his vampirism, Harkon will say how he once ruled as a mighty king, and that his domain was said to be vast and powerful. Despite all of this, his greatest fear was his own mortality, so he pledged himself to &lt;a href=\"Molag%20Bal\"&gt;Molag Bal&lt;/a&gt; and in his name he sacrificed a thousand innocents. In return, the Lord of Enslavement granted him immortality by turning him and his family into pure-blood vampires.\nProphecy.\nAs the years passed and Harkon ran Volkihar, he uncovered a prophecy called the &lt;a href=\"Tyranny%20of%20the%20Sun\"&gt;Tyranny of the Sun&lt;/a&gt;, that, were it to be enacted, would blot out the sun and allow his kin to roam freely during the day. He started becoming obsessed with the prophecy and everything in his life, including his family, was pushed aside to try and make it a reality.\u00a0\nTo enact the prophecy he required the ancient artifact called &lt;a href=\"Auriel%27s%20Bow%20%28Dawnguard%29\"&gt;Auriel's Bow&lt;/a&gt; and the blood of a &lt;a href=\"Daughters%20of%20Coldharbour\"&gt;Daughter of Coldharbour&lt;/a&gt;. He would then taint an &lt;a href=\"Elven%20Arrow%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Elven arrow&lt;/a&gt; with the blood and shoot it at the sun with the bow.\u00a0Harkon wanted to use his daughter,\u00a0&lt;a href=\"Serana\"&gt;Serana&lt;/a&gt;, as a source for the blood, as she is a Daughter of Coldharbour. His estranged wife &lt;a href=\"Valerica\"&gt;Valerica&lt;/a&gt; saw how obsessed Harkon was becoming and disagreed with his goal. She believed that vampires should stay in the shadows, otherwise it would bring too much attention to their kind, and that mortals would wipe out the vampires, attempting to bring the sun back.\nIn an attempt to stop him fulfilling the prophecy, Valerica locked Serana along with an Elder Scroll in &lt;a href=\"Dimhollow%20Crypt\"&gt;Dimhollow Crypt&lt;/a&gt; for her protection, Valerica herself escaped to the &lt;a href=\"Soul%20Cairn%20%28Dawnguard%29\"&gt;Soul Cairn&lt;/a&gt; with the other scroll sometime before the events in . Harkon, enraged by this betrayal, commanded every vampire in his court to look for them. After the Dragonborn finds Serana and brings her to Castle Volkihar, Harkon regains the confidence to continue his quest to fulfill the prophecy.\nPersonality.\nHarkon is an elitist and sees mortals as inferior beings. He has little regard even for his family, and only remembers his wife and daughter due to his lust for power, though he does seem to think that his actions are benefiting vampire kind. Harkon is cruel and will not let anything stop him in his quest for domination. He views the vampires found throughout the rest of Skyrim to be no more than feral animals that \"frighten the herd\" of mortal citizens of Skyrim that he and his fellow \"pure-bloods\" feed upon.\nHe harbors significant resentment towards his estranged wife, Valerica, and wished to enact revenge upon her for her betrayal. Similarly, Harkon holds a deep abhorrence for &lt;a href=\"Lycanthropy%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;lycanthropes&lt;/a&gt;, considering the &lt;a href=\"Diseases%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;condition&lt;/a&gt; \"filthy.\"\nInteractions.\n&lt;a href=\"Bloodline\"&gt;Bloodline&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe Dragonborn first encounters Harkon upon returning Serana to &lt;a href=\"Castle%20Volkihar\"&gt;Castle Volkihar&lt;/a&gt; after the quest \"&lt;a href=\"Awakening%20%28Dawnguard%29\"&gt;Awakening&lt;/a&gt;.\" As a reward, he offers the Dragonborn the ability to become a Vampire Lord and join his clan of vampires. Alternatively, the Dragonborn can refuse his offer and fight with the &lt;a href=\"Dawnguard%20%28Faction%29\"&gt;Dawnguard&lt;/a&gt; against him.\n&lt;a href=\"Prophet%20%28Vampire%29\"&gt;Prophet&lt;/a&gt;.\nIf the Dragonborn sides with the vampires, Harkon sends the Dragonborn and Serana on a &lt;a href=\"Prophet%20%28Vampire%29\"&gt;quest&lt;/a&gt; to find someone capable of reading the Elder Scroll. The two soon learn they need to find\u00a0&lt;a href=\"Dexion%20Evicus\"&gt;Dexion Evicus&lt;/a&gt;,\u00a0a Moth Priest who can read Elder Scrolls, who's held up in\u00a0&lt;a href=\"Forebears%27%20Holdout\"&gt;Forebears' Holdout&lt;/a&gt;. After getting Dexion and bringing him back to the Castle, the Dragonborn learns that two additional Scrolls are needed to complete the prophecy. Harkon then sends the Dragonborn to find them, stating that they are located hidden with his wife Valerica and the other in some &lt;a href=\"Tower%20of%20Mzark\"&gt;Dwarven ruins&lt;/a&gt;. After finding and deciphering the last two Elder Scrolls, the Dragonborn is finally sent to recover Auriel's Bow.\n&lt;a href=\"Kindred%20Judgment\"&gt;Kindred Judgment&lt;/a&gt;.\nEventually, the Dragonborn and Serana realize that Harkon's plan will doom vampires and mortals alike and decide to stop serving him. Once the three &lt;a href=\"Elder%20Scroll%20%28Lore%29\"&gt;Elder Scrolls&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"Elder%20Scroll%20%28Blood%29\"&gt;Blood&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Elder%20Scroll%20%28Dragon%29\"&gt;Dragon&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Elder%20Scroll%20%28Sun%29\"&gt;Sun&lt;/a&gt; have been deciphered and Auriel's Bow has been gained in the quest \"&lt;a href=\"Touching%20the%20Sky%20%28Quest%29\"&gt;Touching the Sky&lt;/a&gt;,\" the Dragonborn and Serana go to Castle Volkihar to confront Harkon. After some dialogue, there is the option to either kill Harkon or give him the bow. Either way, Harkon begins the fight.\nEquipment.\nAfter killing Harkon during &lt;a href=\"Kindred%20Judgment\"&gt;Kindred Judgment&lt;/a&gt;, his ashes appear at the foot of the &lt;a href=\"Molag%20Bal\"&gt;Molag Bal&lt;/a&gt; vampire altar. They can be looted for the following items:\nConversations.\nVingalmo: \"How dare you trespass here! Wait... Serana? Is that truly you? I cannot believe my eyes! My lord! Everyone! Serana has returned!\"\nSerana: \"I guess I'm expected.\"\nFeran: \"I can't believe it.\"\nHarkon: \"My long-lost daughter returns at last. I trust you have my Elder Scroll?\"\nSerana: \"After all these years, that's the first thing you ask me? Yes, I have the scroll.\"\nHestla: \"She has the scroll!\"\nOrthjolf: \"The scroll!\"\nHarkon: \"Of course I'm delighted to see you, my daughter. Must I really say the words aloud? Ah, if only your traitor mother were here, I would let her watch this reunion before putting her head on a spike. Now tell me, who is this stranger you have brought into our hall? \"\nSerana: \"This is my savior, the one who freed me.\"\nHarkon: \"Scions of the night! Hear my words! The prophesied time is at last upon us. Soon we will claim dominion over the sun itself, and forge a new realm of eternal darkness. Now that I have reclaimed one of my Elder Scrolls, we must find a Moth Priest to read it. I have spread false rumors about the discovery of an Elder Scroll in Skyrim to lure a Moth Priest here. Now it is time to see if those efforts have borne fruit. Go forth, and search the land for rumors of a Moth Priest within our borders. Look to the cities. Speak to innkeepers, carriage drivers, anyone who would meet a traveler. Go now, and carry out this task. This is my command!\"\nGaran: \"It will be done, my lord!\"\nRonthil: \"A Moth Priest?\"\nVingalmo: \"Hm. Most interesting.\"\nHarkon: \"So, you've returned. Is your... pet keeping you entertained?\"\nSerana: \"You know why we're here.\"\nHarkon: \"Of course I do. You disappoint me, Serana. You've taken everything I provided for you and thrown it all away for this... pathetic \"\".\"\nSerana: \"Provided for me? Are you insane? You've destroyed our family. You've killed other vampires.

Your voice drips with the venom of your mother's influence. How alike you've become.\"\nSerana: \"No... Because unlike her, I'm not afraid of you. Not anymore.\"\nHarkon: \"\"And you...\"\n[During the fight]\nSerana: \"Tough day for you!\"\nSerana: \"Sorry it had to be this way!\"\nSerana: \"This won't end well for you!\"\nHarkon: \"No... Serana... your own father...\"\nHarkon: \"Serana, my darling. I see you still favor keeping a pet.\"\nSerana: \"You know why we're here.\"\nHarkon: \"Of course I do. You disappoint me, Serana. You've taken everything I provided for you and thrown it all away for this... pathetic being.\"\nSerana: \"Provided for me? Are you insane? You've destroyed our family. You've killed other vampires.

It is relatively small compared to some of Skyrim's labyrinth-like subterranean areas and is easily navigated. There is one puzzle in Harmugstahl with four levers controlling a metal barred/spiked passageway. There is one adept locked door that needs to be picked. There are also two locked doors found after encountering &lt;a href=\"Kornalus%20Frey\"&gt;Kornalus Frey&lt;/a&gt;; both can be unlocked with his key.\nIn Kornalus' room there is a &lt;a href=\"Shrine%20of%20Julianos\"&gt;Shrine of Julianos&lt;/a&gt; and a few &lt;a href=\"Alchemy%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;alchemy&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Ingredients%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;ingredients&lt;/a&gt;.\nCharacters.\nUpon entering the cave, the &lt;a href=\"Last%20Dragonborn\"&gt;Dragonborn&lt;/a&gt; will be greeted by an &lt;a href=\"Adventurer%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;adventurer&lt;/a&gt; killing a &lt;a href=\"Frostbite%20Spider%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;frostbite spider&lt;/a&gt;. Upon asking him, \"What was going on with that spider?\" he will reply, \"I don't know, but this place is full of them. Every one I've encountered has been enchanted or the like. Look, I'm getting out of here. Normally, spiders make my skin crawl, but magic spiders? Blech!\"\nThe Dragonborn will also encounter the cave's resident mage, Kornalus. It appears he has been experimenting on the spiders by enchanting them with fire, frost and shock enchantments. The enchantments manifest themselves in special attacks the spiders can deal, as well as a magical glow on their bodies. Many spider corpses can also be found lying on tables scattered about the cave. Taking any loot from their body may cause them to ignite.\nLever puzzle solution.\nUpon arriving in the room, all the levers should be up. If they are not, it will not work, so you need to either load your auto-save game from when you entered the area, or try to exit the area and enter again, until you have them all in the correct position.\nIf the levers are all up (opposite to you, pointing to the gate), if you number the levers 1, 2, 3, 4 starting from the left when facing the corridor (so 1 being the left one, and 4 being the right one), you should pull 1, then wait until the two leftmost spears have retracted, then pull lever 4.\nThe reason for this solution is simple: lever 1 inverts the position of spears 1 and 2. Lever 2 inverts the position of spears 1, 2 and 3. Levers 3 and 4 do the exact same thing, but on the opposite side: lever 3 inverts spears 2, 3 and 4. Lever 4 inverts spears 3 and 4. This knowledge will prove invaluable if you have already played with the levers prior to reading this, and their positions are all messed up. The puzzle begins with all 4 spears in the \"raised\" position.\nThe confusion about this puzzle stems from the fact that after pulling a lever it takes a few moments for all the spears associated with that lever to change position. Pulling another lever before the spears finish moving means that lever has no effect. Simply wait patiently for the spears to finish moving before pulling the next lever.\nQuests.\n&lt;a href=\"Family%20Heirloom\"&gt;Family Heirloom&lt;/a&gt;.\nFulfill a contract for the Companions to retrieve a stolen family heirloom.\n&lt;a href=\"Arniel%27s%20Endeavor\"&gt;Arniel's Endeavor&lt;/a&gt;.\nRetrieve a staff for &lt;a href=\"Enthir\"&gt;Enthir&lt;/a&gt;.\n&lt;a href=\"Lost%20Relic\"&gt;Lost Relic&lt;/a&gt;.\nRetrieve the &lt;a href=\"Dawnguard%20Rune%20Hammer\"&gt;Dawnguard Rune Hammer&lt;/a&gt;.\n&lt;a href=\"The%20Forgemaster%27s%20Fingers\"&gt;The Forgemaster's Fingers&lt;/a&gt;.\nFind this item to gain access to &lt;a href=\"Orc%20Stronghold\"&gt;Orc Stronghold&lt;/a&gt;s.\n&lt;a href=\"Totems%20of%20Hircine\"&gt;Totems of Hircine&lt;/a&gt;.\n&lt;a href=\"Aela%20the%20Huntress%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Aela the Huntress&lt;/a&gt; asks the Dragonborn to retrieve three &lt;a href=\"werewolf%20Totem\"&gt;werewolf Totem&lt;/a&gt;s.\n&lt;a href=\"Wind%20and%20Sand%20%28Dragonborn%20Quest%29\"&gt;Wind and Sand&lt;/a&gt;.\nRetrieve a copy of the book \"&lt;a href=\"Wind%20and%20Sand%20%28Dragonborn%20Book%29\"&gt;Wind and Sand&lt;/a&gt;\" for &lt;a href=\"Neloth%20%28Dragonborn%29\"&gt;Neloth&lt;/a&gt;.\n&lt;a href=\"Fetch%20Me%20That%20Book%21\"&gt;Fetch Me That Book!&lt;/a&gt;.\nFind rare books for &lt;a href=\"Urag%20gro-Shub\"&gt;Urag gro-Shub&lt;/a&gt;.\n&lt;a href=\"Trouble%20in%20Skyrim\"&gt;Trouble in Skyrim&lt;/a&gt;.\nKill the leader of Harmugstahl."}

The headmaster, &lt;a href=\"Tanion\"&gt;Tanion&lt;/a&gt;, thinks that &lt;a href=\"Alliance%20War\"&gt;the war&lt;/a&gt; justifies any tactics the College uses. The Bosmer are being forced to renounce the &lt;a href=\"Green%20Pact\"&gt;Green Pact&lt;/a&gt; every day. The Khajiit have to tuck in their tails, or they are thrown in the cave.\nBackground.\n\"I arrived at a place called the College of Aldmeri Propriety. One of the students claims this Thalmor training ground heaps hardship and abuse upon the Wood Elf and Khajiit students. She's asked me to investigate.\"\nWalkthrough.\nWhen approaching the &lt;a href=\"College%20of%20Aldmeri%20Propriety\"&gt;College of Aldmeri Propriety&lt;/a&gt;, you will run into a woman called &lt;a href=\"Baham%20%28Auridon%29\"&gt;Baham&lt;/a&gt;. She will tell you what kind of college you have stumbled upon; that the Bosmer and Khajiit here are being forced to forget their culture and assimilate into Altmer society. When she hears that you are with &lt;a href=\"Queen%20Ayrenn%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Queen Ayrenn&lt;/a&gt;, she will request that you go speak to the headmaster about the goings-on here. \nHead across the bridge and toward the big building you see there. You will find the headmaster &lt;a href=\"Tanion\"&gt;Tanion&lt;/a&gt; being threatened by a Khajiit named &lt;a href=\"Zaban\"&gt;Zaban&lt;/a&gt;. Speak with the headmaster and he will insist that no abuse is going on here; the lessons are supposedly tough but fair. He will allow you to inspect the classrooms and speak with the teachers. \nHead into the building. The classroom for the Bosmer students will be just ahead; you will hear them reciting a pledge to renounce the green pact and accept the Altmer as their superiors. If you talk to the student named &lt;a href=\"Borchon\"&gt;Borchon&lt;/a&gt;, he will tell you that they are forced to renounce the green pact every day as part of their indoctrination. After this, head to the Khajiiti classroom on the second floor. There, you will find that a student is being forced to tuck in her tail, or else be thrown in the cave as punishment. Speak with the student and she will tell you that students are often thrown into &lt;a href=\"Saltspray%20Cave\"&gt;Saltspray Cave&lt;/a&gt; up north, as punishment for not acting the way the instructors want. \nNow that you have inspected both classrooms, the next part of your inspection of this facility involves heading outside and sparring with the proctors. Beat four of them up, then return to Tanion. You can either lie to him that you were impressed, or express your disgust at how the students are being treated. If you chose the former, . If you chose the latter, he will tell you that these methods are necessary because these students are undisciplined and there is a war going on. Either way, head back to Baham and talk to her; she will be standing by the bridge. \nBaham will ask you to help out in distributing healing supplies she got from the &lt;a href=\"Baandari%20Clan\"&gt;Baandari&lt;/a&gt; to the students who received serious beatings today. You can get the supplies from &lt;a href=\"Nurad\"&gt;Nurad&lt;/a&gt;, who is across the bridge, in the dorm directly opposite from the bridge. Once you get the supplies from him, bring them to &lt;a href=\"Brinthir\"&gt;Brinthir&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Thalorel\"&gt;Thalorel&lt;/a&gt;, who are in the dorms to your right as you exit this one. After you have healed both of them, head back to Baham, who will be just outside. \nBaham will tell you that her friend &lt;a href=\"Ilara\"&gt;Ilara&lt;/a&gt; has been taken to the Cave. She thinks it is time to take up action and rebel against the instructors; she will ask you to go speak to the Baandari leader Zaban to get them some weapons. Zaban will be northeast of the college. When you arrive at the Baandari camp however, you will find that an agent of the &lt;a href=\"Veiled%20Heritance\"&gt;Veiled Heritance&lt;/a&gt; has murdered all the cats there; there will be &lt;a href=\"Zaban%27s%20Letter\"&gt;a letter&lt;/a&gt; by Zaban's body indicating that Zaban was one of the &lt;a href=\"Eyes%20of%20the%20Queen\"&gt;Eyes of the Queen&lt;/a&gt; and that Tanion works for the &lt;a href=\"Veiled%20Queen\"&gt;Veiled Queen&lt;/a&gt;. \nBaham and her allies will arrive shortly after; talk to her about what you found out. She will ask you to head into the Cave and save Ilara while she and her allies grab weapons from the camp and confront their teachers. Saltspray Cave is west of your current location; head in and fight your way through to the end, defeating all the Veiled Heritance agents along the way. Head through to the inner cave and you will find Tanion beating up Ilara. Kill him, then go speak with Ilara. Reassure her that it is all over and Tanion is dead, then head outside with her. Speak with Baham outside the caves to finish the quest; she will reassure you that they have taken over the school and that the place will now actually be a place of learning."}

The earliest entry is marked \"&lt;a href=\"Harvest%27s%20End%20%28Holiday%29\"&gt;Harvest's End&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"3E%20172\"&gt;3E 172&lt;/a&gt;.\" Only the first few pages make sense. Later entries are incoherent and illegible. In the first few pages you learn the basic story of Chimere, Master Sorcerer, Summoner, and &lt;a href=\"Direnni%20Bloodline\"&gt;Direnni&lt;/a&gt; retainer, and how he treated with &lt;a href=\"Lord%20Dagon\"&gt;Lord Dagon&lt;/a&gt;, tricked him, and paid the price of his victory.\nChimere Graegyn was a retainer of the ambitious Direnni clan. The Direnni derived the bulk of their power from their traffickings with &lt;a href=\"Daedra\"&gt;Daedra&lt;/a&gt;, a very profitable but risky path to success. Chimere was perhaps the cleverest and most ambitious of the Direnni summoners. He dared to scheme against Lord Dagon, and won. When his trick succeeded, Dagon was cast into &lt;a href=\"Oblivion%20%28Realm%29\"&gt;Oblivion&lt;/a&gt;. However, in the instant of his betrayal, Dagon struck out against the mortal who tricked him. Chimere's pact assured that he would live forever in his home town among the happy voices of his friends and countrymen. Twisting the literal words of Chimere's pact, Dagon scooped up tiny &lt;a href=\"Caecilly%20Island\"&gt;Caecilly Island&lt;/a&gt; (a small island off the coast of &lt;a href=\"Northmoor\"&gt;Northmoor&lt;/a&gt;) and hurled in into the void. All Chimere's friends and countrymen were instantly killed, though the sounds of their voices remained to torment Chimere's memory. Chimere was condemned to live forever, to grow progressively old and crippled with arthritis, and to contemplate the tragic consequences of his defiance of fate and fortune in cheating a Daedra Lord.\nIn the earlier, more lucid sections of the journal, you also find other information of relevance to your current plight.\nSearching for details of Chimere's successful defeat of Dagon, you find the following:\nThe &lt;a href=\"Cuirass%20of%20the%20Savior%27s%20Hide\"&gt;Armor of the Saviour's Hide&lt;/a&gt;: Created by the Daedra Lord &lt;a href=\"Malacath\"&gt;Malacath&lt;/a&gt;, this armor has the marvelous property of turning the blow of an oathbreaker. Chimere tricked Dagon into swearing an oath against the Powers which he had no intention of keeping. The Hide of the Savior turned Dagon's titanic fury long enough for Chimere to deliver his own attack -- an incantation invoked upon Dagon's \"Protonymic\" (i.e., True Name). Unfortunately, like many of Malacath's gifts, the armor is a mixed blessing. It also makes its wearer exceptionally vulnerable to magical attacks, so one should only wear it for particular occasions.\nDagon's &lt;a href=\"Protonymic\"&gt;Protonymic&lt;/a&gt;: Chimere used Dagon's Protonymic in an incantation to invoke a sorcery that would gradually drain all of Dagon's power into the void. Chimere miscalculated, however, not realizing that Dagon's resistance could slow the draining of his power, even if it could not stop it. As a result, Dagon had the time to curse Chimere with a literal fulfillment of the terms of his bargain with Chimere. Rather than let his power drain into the void, Dagon cast it all into his curse. As a result, Caecilly Island was cast into the void, all its citizens were horribly slain, and Chimere was condemned to live forever among the ruins of his greatest ambition.\nYou also find the following details concerning the Rituals of the Hunt:\nThe Chapel of the Innocent Quarry: Chimere believes that Dagon had Caecilly Island established as the site of the Chapel of the Innocent Quarry to personally mock and torment Chimere. The green crystal structure was created by enchantments, and is the only building on the island erected since it was ripped from &lt;a href=\"Tamriel\"&gt;Tamriel&lt;/a&gt; and loosed in the void.\nThe Spear: Supposedly the &lt;a href=\"Spear%20of%20Bitter%20Mercy%20%28Battlespire%29\"&gt;Spear of Bitter Mercy&lt;/a&gt; used in the &lt;a href=\"Wild%20Hunt\"&gt;Wild Hunt&lt;/a&gt;s could not be handled by any mortal or immortal save the ones sanctified to the Hunt and bound by its strictures. However, Chimere has determined that though the Spear's power is great, it is not unlimited, and that certain enchanted items -- for instance, the Armor of the Savior's Hide, forged by Malacath -- are sufficient to protect a mortal or immortal bearer from its maleficent energies."}

Chimere's pact assured that he would live forever in his home town among the happy voices of his friends and countrymen. Twisting the literal words of Chimere's pact, Dagon scooped up tiny &lt;a href=\"Caecilly%20Island\"&gt;Caecilly Island&lt;/a&gt; (a small island off the coast of &lt;a href=\"Glenumbra\"&gt;Glenumbra&lt;/a&gt;) and hurled in into the void. All Chimere's friends and countrymen were instantly killed, though the sounds of their voices remained to torment Chimere's memory. Chimere was condemned to live forever, to grow progressively old and crippled with arthritis, and to contemplate the tragic consequences of his defiance of fate and fortune in cheating a &lt;a href=\"Daedric%20Princes\"&gt;Daedra Lord&lt;/a&gt;.\n&lt;a href=\"Cuirass%20of%20the%20Savior%27s%20Hide\"&gt;Armor of the Saviour's Hide&lt;/a&gt;:\nCreated by the Daedra Lord &lt;a href=\"Malacath\"&gt;Malacath&lt;/a&gt;, this armor has the marvelous property of turning the blow of an oathbreaker. Chimere tricked Dagon into swearing an oath against the Powers which he had no intention of keeping. The Hide of the Savior turned Dagon's titanic fury long enough for Chimere to deliver his own attack\u2014an incantation invoked upon Dagon's \"Protonymic\" (i.e., Incantatory True Name). Unfortunately, like many of Malacath's gifts, the armor is a mixed blessing. It also makes its wearer exceptionally vulnerable to magical attacks, so one should only wear it for particular occasions.\nDagon's Protonymic:\nChimere used Dagon's Protonymic in an incantation to invoke a sorcery that would gradually drain all of Dagon's power into the void. Chimere miscalculated, however, not realizing that Dagon's resistance could slow the draining of his power, even if it could not stop it. As a result, Dagon had the time to curse Chimere with a literal fulfillment of the terms of his bargain with Chimere. Rather than let his power drain into the void, Dagon cast it all into his curse. As a result, Caecilly Island was cast into the void, all its citizens were horribly slain, and Chimere was condemned to live forever among the ruins of his greatest ambition.\nRituals of the Hunt:\nThe Chapel of the Innocent Quarry: Chimere believes that Dagon had Caecilly Island established as the site of the Chapel of the Innocent Quarry to personally mock and torment Chimere. The green crystal structure was created by enchantments, and is the only building on the island erected since it was ripped from &lt;a href=\"Tamriel\"&gt;Tamriel&lt;/a&gt; and loosed in the void.\nThe Spear:\nSupposedly the &lt;a href=\"Spear%20of%20Bitter%20Mercy\"&gt;Spear of Bitter Mercy&lt;/a&gt; used in the &lt;a href=\"Great%20Hunt\"&gt;Great Hunt&lt;/a&gt;s could not be handled by any mortal or immortal save the ones sanctified to the Hunt and bound by its strictures. However, Chimere has determined that though the Spear's power is great, it is not unlimited, and that certain enchanted items\u2014for instance, the Armor of the Savior's Hide, forged by Malacath\u2014are sufficient to protect a mortal or immortal bearer from its maleficent energies."}

The injuries I suffered in my last encounter with these deadly arachnids prevent me from undertaking the task myself, which is why I've hired you.\nCollecting the venom of the &lt;a href=\"Frostbite%20Spider%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;frostbite spider&lt;/a&gt; is not a complicated task, but there is some risk involved. I've written this brief guide in the hope that you'll be able to avoid making some of the mistake that I've made.\nFrostbite spiders most often make their lairs in caves. There creatures do not shun the icy climes of the north, for as their name implies, they are largely immune to the cold.\nWhen food is especially scarce, a spider will venture out to hunt prey in the wilderness. Usually, however, the eight-legged devils prefer to ambush those unfortunate creatures who venture into their caverns seeking shelter.\nThe easiest way to locate a nest of frostbite spiders is to search for their large webs. Just take care not to get caught in one, for those webs are strong enough to trap a full-grown man. Once any part of you touches the sticky threads, it's nearly impossible to get free without help.\nAlso, keep a watchful eye toward the ceiling. The frostbite spider is as stealthy as it is swift, and can drop down onto your head and have its fangs into your back before you can scream.\nAs long as you find the frostbite spider before it finds you, collecting the venom should be a simple matter. Because they rely on their webs to immobilize their prey, the creatures are not that difficult to kill in open combat. If you're inclined toward the arcane arts, don't bother with ice spells. Fire magic will serve you far better.\nWith that, I will say farewell and good hunting. Remember, any loot that you find in the spider's web is yours to keep.\nThe larger the hole, the larger the spider."}
