They appear as tall human-like creatures with black-and-red skin, black hair, and short, curved horns on their heads. Though they give each other various ranks depending on how strong and powerful they are, Dremora have no concept of names or innate individuality (see &lt;a href=\"Dremora%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;\"Oblivion's\" Dremora page&lt;/a&gt; for more information on Dremora society). Dremora speak their own language as well as &lt;a href=\"Tamrielic\"&gt;Tamrielic&lt;/a&gt;, although the latter is mainly used as battle cries to taunt mortal opponents. All Dremora in Skyrim are dressed in either &lt;a href=\"Daedric%20Armor%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Daedric armor&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"Black%20Robes\"&gt;Black Robes&lt;/a&gt;, depending on whether they wield conventional weapons or magic, respectively.\nSummoning.\nThe spell &lt;a href=\"Summon%20Unbound%20Dremora\"&gt;Summon Unbound Dremora&lt;/a&gt; spawns a Dremora where the caster is pointing; however, the Dremora is unbound and will immediately become hostile and attack, regardless of any attempted interactions.\nA random unbound Dremora can also be summoned by using the &lt;a href=\"Atronach%20Forge%23Random%20unbound%20Dremora\"&gt;Atronach Forge&lt;/a&gt; and providing it with the proper ingredients.\nWhen summoned with the &lt;a href=\"Sanguine%20Rose%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Sanguine Rose&lt;/a&gt;, the Dremora will be considered \"bound\" and will fight for the &lt;a href=\"Last%20Dragonborn\"&gt;Dragonborn&lt;/a&gt;, just like any other conjured &lt;a href=\"Familiar%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Familiar&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"Atronach\"&gt;Atronach&lt;/a&gt;. Dremora summoned in this way will not drop anything when killed.\nIt is possible that the use of the &lt;a href=\"Wabbajack%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Wabbajack&lt;/a&gt; will turn the target into a leveled hostile Dremora.\nWith installed, one can use powers received from the \"\" quest to summon either a &lt;a href=\"Dremora%20Butler\"&gt;Dremora Butler&lt;/a&gt; or a &lt;a href=\"Dremora%20Merchant\"&gt;Dremora Merchant&lt;/a&gt;.\nDremora types.\nDremora mages and archers cannot be summoned.

He then joins the rest of the Companions at the &lt;a href=\"Skyforge%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Skyforge&lt;/a&gt;.\nKodlak's funeral.\nAll the members of the Companions are here, along with &lt;a href=\"Balgruuf%20the%20Greater\"&gt;Jarl Balgruuf&lt;/a&gt; and a few other &lt;a href=\"Whiterun%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Whiterun&lt;/a&gt; citizens to pay their respects to the fallen Harbinger of the Companions. &lt;a href=\"The%20Circle\"&gt;The Circle&lt;/a&gt; members will begin prayers, and &lt;a href=\"Eorlund%20Gray-Mane\"&gt;Eorlund&lt;/a&gt; gives a eulogy. Aela will then light Kodlak's funeral pyre and ask the Circle members to retire to &lt;a href=\"The%20Underforge\"&gt;The Underforge&lt;/a&gt;. Once the ceremony concludes, Eorlund will ask the Dragonborn to give him the collected fragments of &lt;a href=\"Wuuthrad%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Wuuthrad&lt;/a&gt; so he can prepare them for re-forging.\nAfter the Dragonborn turns over the fragments, Eorlund Gray-Mane asks them to retrieve the last shard of Wuuthrad from Kodlak's end drawer, located in his room in the basement of &lt;a href=\"Jorrvaskr\"&gt;Jorrvaskr&lt;/a&gt;. One has the option to take &lt;a href=\"Kodlak%27s%20Journal\"&gt;his journal&lt;/a&gt;, which talks about the Dragonborn and the dreams which foretold their coming into Kodlak's life and leading up to this point with helping the Companions and the Circle.\nWhen the Dragonborn returns to the Skyforge and gives the last fragment to Eorlund, Eorlund offers his thanks and says that the Dragonborn's Shield-Siblings await them in the Underforge.\nAfter the Dragonborn enters &lt;a href=\"the%20Underforge\"&gt;the Underforge&lt;/a&gt;, a conversation about Kodlak ensues between the Circle members. Eorlund arrives, with Wuuthrad, which he passes to the Dragonborn. The Circle then resolves to travel to &lt;a href=\"Ysgramor%27s%20Tomb\"&gt;Ysgramor's Tomb&lt;/a&gt; and posthumously cure Kodlak of his &lt;a href=\"Lycanthropy%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Lycanthropy&lt;/a&gt;.\nYsgramor's Tomb.\nThe Dragonborn must travel to Ysgramor's Tomb, northwest of &lt;a href=\"Winterhold%20%28Skyrim%20City%29\"&gt;Winterhold&lt;/a&gt;. They may &lt;a href=\"Fast%20Travel%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;fast travel&lt;/a&gt; or accompany the Circle as they walk there. One must ensure that there is at least one &lt;a href=\"Glenmoril%20Witch%20Head\"&gt;Glenmoril Witch Head&lt;/a&gt; in the inventory before undertaking the trip.\nThe statue of &lt;a href=\"Ysgramor%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Ysgramor&lt;/a&gt; is activated by placing Wuuthrad into the statue's hands. Doing so will open the pathway at the end of the hall that leads to the burial chamber. Once the passageway opens, Wuuthrad can be removed with no ill effects. From this moment forth, it is the Dragonborn's exclusive property. Vilkas will elect not to join the others as they make their way to the Burial Chamber, noting that his grief has clouded his judgment recently. He will wait by the statue.\nSeveral &lt;a href=\"Frostbite%20Spider%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Frostbite Spiders&lt;/a&gt; are on the path, including one &lt;a href=\"Giant%20Frostbite%20Spider\"&gt;Giant Frostbite Spider&lt;/a&gt;, but the majority of enemies are &lt;a href=\"Ghost%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;ghosts&lt;/a&gt; of past Companions. These mean the Circle members no harm; they are present as a test more than anything, and must be fought. Farkas will reach a point where he, like his brother, can go no further, citing his terror of Frostbite Spiders ever since he and the Dragonborn fought them in &lt;a href=\"Dustman%27s%20Cairn\"&gt;Dustman's Cairn&lt;/a&gt;. The Dragonborn and &lt;a href=\"Aela%20the%20Huntress%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Aela&lt;/a&gt; enter the Burial Chamber together.\nActivate the fire, and in so doing, drop a Glenmoril Witch's head into the flames. Doing this will release Kodlak's beast spirit and a battle will ensue. Defeating the beast spirit will free Kodlak's spirit. The Beast Spirit can be difficult to see at times, so an attack which leaves a lingering visual effect (such as &lt;a href=\"Flames%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Flames&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"Fire%20Breath%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Fire Breath&lt;/a&gt;) will highlight the spirit.\nUpon the successful cure of Kodlak's spirit, the Dragonborn will be granted the title of Harbinger of the Companions, making them their first true leader since Ysgramor himself. Before leaving the burial chamber, one can acquire the &lt;a href=\"Shield%20of%20Ysgramor\"&gt;Shield of Ysgramor&lt;/a&gt; from the chest at the top of the spiral ramp to the right of his sarcophagus.\nCuring the Dragonborn's lycanthropy (optional).\nIf the Dragonborn wishes to cure themselves of Lycanthropy, they may do so at this point, if they defeated and kept more than one of the Glenmoril Witches' heads during the \"&lt;a href=\"Blood%27s%20Honor\"&gt;Blood's Honor&lt;/a&gt;\" quest. If not, they can travel back to &lt;a href=\"Glenmoril%20Coven\"&gt;Glenmoril Coven&lt;/a&gt; to defeat another witch and take her head. If Ysgramor's Tomb is exited before curing the disease, the \"&lt;a href=\"Purity\"&gt;Purity&lt;/a&gt;\" quest for Vilkas and/or Farkas must be completed before being able to be cured. As long as the Dragonborn does not go back to Jorrvaskr first, they can re-enter the tomb after retrieving the Glenmoril Witches' heads and cure themselves of Lycanthropy without doing the \"Purity\" quest for Vilkas or Farkas.\nActivating the fire again (which will remove a second Glenmoril Witch head from the inventory) will release the Dragonborn's Beast Form and a battle will ensue. Defeating the Beast Spirit in combat will cure Lycanthropy (the Beast Form can still be used during the fight but will automatically revert once the Beast Spirit is defeated). The cure is permanent and Lycanthropy will no longer be able to be contracted, unless the player has installed the add-on, in which the player can talk to Aela again to once again become a Lycanthrope. Even with the &lt;a href=\"Hircine%27s%20Ring%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Ring of Hircine&lt;/a&gt; equipped, the Dragonborn will no longer be able to transform into a werewolf once this ritual is performed."}

For years I've thought about how I could tell you this, and each time I imagined it would be face-to-face. I'm ashamed for what I did, and I hope that someday you'll learn to forgive me. Whatever you do, don't blame &lt;a href=\"Delvin%20Mallory%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Delvin&lt;/a&gt; for any of this. He didn't know.\nLong after I joined &lt;a href=\"Thieves%20Guild%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;the Guild&lt;/a&gt;, I was sent to rob a caravan that was stopping at a tiny farming village far from the border of &lt;a href=\"Skyrim\"&gt;Skyrim&lt;/a&gt;. When I arrived there, I was a day early and decided to sleep for the night in the barn of a pig farm. I awoke the next morning when the most beautiful woman I'd ever laid eyes upon walked in to do her chores. She wasn't even frightened when she saw me... in an instant I think we had both fallen in love. I ended up living with that woman in that tiny little village for a year until she was with child. And then, like a coward... I ran away. I was a thief and I didn't want to end up a farmer. It was a terrible thing to do.\nI didn't have the courage to return to that village for almost fifteen years. When I finally decided to visit, it was too late. It had been raided by bandits and burned to the ground. Everyone was either dead or gone. Including you... my only child.\nYears later, when you were recruited by &lt;a href=\"Brynjolf%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Brynjolf&lt;/a&gt; I couldn't believe my eyes. You're a spitting image of your mother and I knew it was you in an instant. Only the gods know how you survived the attack on that village and why you followed in my footsteps, but I have to assume it was meant to be. I've wanted to walk right up to you and embrace you, to tell you the truth, but I was still a coward. I decided to leave &lt;a href=\"Riften%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Riften&lt;/a&gt; instead of facing your anger. I said my goodbyes to Delvin and I headed for &lt;a href=\"Solstheim%20%28Dragonborn%29\"&gt;Solstheim&lt;/a&gt;... as far from the truth as I could get.\nI'm sorry, my daughter. I'm sorry for never being there to hold you at night or to protect you from whatever hardships you endured. One day, I hope you'll make the journey to Solstheim and visit your father.\n&lt;a href=\"Glover%20Mallory\"&gt;Glover Mallory&lt;/a&gt;"}

I came to the city as a mage of modest means. Nothing but holes in my pockets, and a rattling cart full of knickknacks. I suppose you could consider me a con-man. My game was simple: lure affluent, small-minded people to my cart and make a wager. \"I bet you\u2014\" I said, \"I bet you I can turn whatever you have in your pocket into an apple.\" Of course it wasn't always apples. It could be a thimble, or a button, or an old shoe. Inevitably, they would bite and take up the bet. I would cast a simple translocative spell, whisking their item into my cart, and replacing it with whatever garbage I had managed to gather up the day before. Such a transfer is child's-play when compared to an actual transmutation. Thus, my gain was two-fold: I acquired whatever item they happened to be carrying around, as well as the balance of the wager. This earned me a decent living for a while. Until I ran into the Rattle-Man.\nHe was tall, certainly\u2014and very, very thin. And when he walked, his coin-purse made an unnerving clatter. A rattling of what sounded like bone on bone. I didn't have to flag him down, or lay out my pitch. He simply reached into his pocket and produced a handful of random objects. Teeth, bone chips, glowing shards \u2026. His silence was unsettling, and the items were so random and macabre I could barely keep my composure. But I was greedy then. Greedy, and foolish.\nHe eventually spoke in a low, rasping voice, \"Shall we make a wager?\"\n\"Of course!\" I said. \"Eight drakes for eight trinkets!\"\n\"Make it fifty drakes if you succeed. And if you fail \u2026.\" he replied.\nA fifty drake wager! It took me a moment to process this. I had never even considered the results of a failure. \"Well, if I fail, I suppose I'll owe you fifty drakes.\" This seemed to rub him the wrong way. He put the items in his pocket and turned to leave.\nEven now, I will wake from a dead sleep, gasping over the horror of this moment. Reliving it in my mind, over and over. If I had just let him walk away. If I had been distracted by another mark, or taken my lunch early, all of this might have been avoided. But as I said, I was greedy and foolish. I shouted over his shoulder, \"What would you have instead, sir?\"\nHe turned on his heel and smiled. At least I think it was a smile. I don't remember his face, you see? No one ever remembers his face. He spoke in a whisper, \"I only want a vow that you'll return the items to me when the trick is done.\"\nHe knew my game. No corner-cob hustler would weave a transmutation spell for five drakes. He knew I just took the items into my cart via a translocation cantrip. So why worry? I would simply reach into my cart and hand him the items after the spell was cast. There was a fear in the pit of my stomach, but I took his clammy, pale hand in mine and shook on it. \"You have my vow,\" I said. And with those four words, my fate was sealed.\nI cast the translocation spell as normal. There was a brilliant flash of light, and a puff of colorful smoke. All according to plan. And just as I expected, his handful of terrifying trinkets had been \"transformed\" into a handful of buttons, bent silverware, and scraps of shoe leather.\n\"Excellent.\" he rasped. \"Now, if I could have my items back, we can conclude our wager.\"\nI was elated. Fifty drakes! Fifty drakes for a small-time hustle. I was practically dancing when I opened the cart. But something was wrong. All my items were gone. Everything. I searched everywhere\u2014my pockets, inside the cart, the street beneath. Nothing. \"It appears that you have failed,\" he said.\nAnd thus began my endless service to the Rattle-Man. I will search for his missing items for the rest of my days.\nMy life is a curse. My nights are filled with bad dreams, my days with waking terrors. My bones strain and creak. My hair grows thinner and paler by the day. All for a handful of bone scraps and teeth.\nSo, I make this compact with you, dear reader. Bring me your frightful trinkets\u2014your bone scraps and bloody claws. Bring them to my trophy vaults, and I will grant you riches beyond imagining. Do not trouble yourself with thoughts of where these riches came from. I have had to become very \u2026 resourceful. Scruples are a luxury that the cursed cannot afford. No, only the trinkets matter.\nPerhaps one day I will find all of the Rattle-Man's trinkets. And on that day, I will kill myself and leave this accursed world behind."}

Once, as an Experiment, I substituted kidney stones of Poetry, Aspic, and Ennui. It didn't work!\nBut that is a secret. Not to reveal my secrets! No, no. Do not even think about the secrets. Because if that happens \u2026 Experiments! Back to Experiments! I have made many different glyphs, oh, yes. Some of them are very good, like the glyphs for augmenting one's &lt;a href=\"magicka%20%28Online%29\"&gt;magicka&lt;/a&gt; (rings are pretty!) or for making weapons that do flame or frost damage. Some glyphs are not so good, like the \"lard to bard\" glyph that made all the shortening in the kitchen sing loud Nord drinking songs. (That's why I made all the pancakes.)\nSo, then: Experiments! When you try combining different runestones to see what kind of glyphs you can make, be sure to write down the results so you don't forget what you've learned. (Especially for the bad ones, because you don't want to do that again, and good apprentices are hard to come by.) For obvious reasons (obvious! obvious!), I like to tattoo my results onto the skins of living creatures. &lt;a href=\"Daedra%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Daedra&lt;/a&gt; are a poor choice for this, because when they return to &lt;a href=\"Oblivion%20%28Realm%29\"&gt;Oblivion&lt;/a&gt; they take your results with them.

The Nerevarine traveled to Gnisis to meet with &lt;a href=\"Master%20Baladas\"&gt;Master Baladas&lt;/a&gt; who was living in &lt;a href=\"Arvs-Drelen\"&gt;Arvs-Drelen&lt;/a&gt; at the time. After meeting with Baladas, the Nerevarine became Hortator of House Telvanni and eventually defeat Dagoth Ur.\nSometime prior, &lt;a href=\"Fort%20Darius\"&gt;Fort Darius&lt;/a&gt; was built into Gnisis to guard Gnisis from outside threats. The &lt;a href=\"Talos%20Cult\"&gt;Talos Cult&lt;/a&gt; was involved in a conspiracy to assassinate &lt;a href=\"Uriel%20Septim%20VII\"&gt;Uriel Septim VII&lt;/a&gt; who was visiting Vvardenfell at the time. They were stopped by the Nerevarine, and Uriel was able to live another day.\n&lt;a href=\"Fourth%20Era\"&gt;Fourth Era&lt;/a&gt;.\nGnisis along with many other settlements in Vvardenfell were destroyed when &lt;a href=\"Red%20Mountain\"&gt;Red Mountain&lt;/a&gt; erupted in &lt;a href=\"4E%205\"&gt;4E 5&lt;/a&gt;, resulting in Vvardenfell becoming an ashen wasteland. According to folks from &lt;a href=\"Blacklight\"&gt;Blacklight&lt;/a&gt;, nobody survived Gnisis' destruction except &lt;a href=\"Neria%20Relethyl\"&gt;Neria Relethyl&lt;/a&gt; who went to Blacklight. A House Redoran Councilman established a relief effort to rebuild the cities and towns in Vvardenfell; this included Gnisis. It is unknown whether Gnisis is fully complete or not."}

This is a &lt;a href=\"Side%20Quests%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;side quest&lt;/a&gt; in which an old farmer and fisherman by the name of &lt;a href=\"Aelwin%20Merowald\"&gt;Aelwin Merowald&lt;/a&gt; is looking to retire and needs a dozen &lt;a href=\"Rumare%20Slaughterfish%20Scales\"&gt;Rumare Slaughterfish Scales&lt;/a&gt;.\nHe hopes to sell them to a young mage who Merowald says will net enough to ensure his happy retirement. Acquire the scales for him from the &lt;a href=\"Rumare%20Slaughterfish\"&gt;Rumare Slaughterfish&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Lake%20Rumare\"&gt;Lake Rumare&lt;/a&gt;, just north of that settlement.\nWalkthrough.\nTalk to Aelwin and listen to him discuss how he lost a figurative fight to a bunch of fish. The &lt;a href=\"Hero%20of%20Kvatch\"&gt;Hero&lt;/a&gt; must ask how they can help in order for the quest to proceed. After Aelwin explains the situation he is in, the Hero then must head north into the lake and begin looking for the slaughterfish. In actuality, the fish can be found in the waters around Weye, not just to the north. The green quest marker on the compass and map points to the general location of the \"next\" fish, so finding them is usually easy. However, the fish can sometimes be elsewhere.\nThe time of the day may affect fishing chances. It is recommended to try earlier in the day, rather than late at night. Be sure to quicksave before plunging in, as the Rumare Slaughterfish can be deadly at lower levels. Alternatively, having &lt;a href=\"Water%20Walking%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;Water Walking&lt;/a&gt; and a bow allows the Hero to attack the fish without risking melee combat. A &lt;a href=\"Detect%20Life%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;Detect Life&lt;/a&gt; effect can help spot the fish and one can even &lt;a href=\"Sneak%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;Sneak&lt;/a&gt; while water walking for triple bow damage.\nThe Rumare Slaughterfish are level-scaled: Rumare Slaughterfish Spawn, Rumare Slaughterfish and &lt;a href=\"Brood%20Mother\"&gt;Brood Mother&lt;/a&gt;. The Brood Mother in this quest has a grand-level soul, so one can bring a &lt;a href=\"Grand%20Soul%20Gem%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;Grand Soul Gem&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"Azura%27s%20Star%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;Azura's Star&lt;/a&gt; to fill the gems. To make things much easier for soul trapping her, use a weapon enchanted with a &lt;a href=\"Soul%20Trap%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;Soul Trap&lt;/a&gt; spell for the final blow. If the Hero has a sufficiently high level, all Slaughterfish in the lake will be Brood Mothers.\nOnce all twelve scales have been collected, return to Aelwin for the reward: the &lt;a href=\"Jewel%20of%20the%20Rumare\"&gt;Jewel of the Rumare&lt;/a&gt;."}

The ancient Aldmer first discovered goblins in the &lt;a href=\"Summerset%20Isles\"&gt;Summerset Isles&lt;/a&gt;. They are often found living in clans, particularly in &lt;a href=\"caves\"&gt;caves&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"mines\"&gt;mines&lt;/a&gt;.\nVarious cultures in Tamriel have enslaved Goblins from time to time throughout history. The &lt;a href=\"Tsaesci\"&gt;Tsaesci&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"Akavir\"&gt;Akavir&lt;/a&gt; reportedly brought goblins along during their invasion of Tamriel as servants and\u00a0cannon fodder. The &lt;a href=\"Altmer\"&gt;Altmer&lt;/a&gt; have similarly employed Goblins in this fashion at different points in history.\nPhysical appearance.\nTypically, goblins appear to be short but tough creatures that inhabit &lt;a href=\"caves\"&gt;caves&lt;/a&gt;, sewers, &lt;a href=\"mines\"&gt;mines&lt;/a&gt;, and ruins across the continent. In appearance, they vary in size from smaller than &lt;a href=\"Bosmer\"&gt;Bosmer&lt;/a&gt; to larger than &lt;a href=\"Nords\"&gt;Nords&lt;/a&gt;. They have pronounced teeth (resembling &lt;a href=\"Orsimer\"&gt;Orsimer&lt;/a&gt; teeth) and skin that ranges from blue to green. They are relatives to the larger &lt;a href=\"ogre\"&gt;ogre&lt;/a&gt;s and smaller &lt;a href=\"gremlin\"&gt;gremlin&lt;/a&gt;s.\nCulture.\nGoblins are a primitive and violent humanoid race found across Tamriel and Akavir. Goblins were already present in Tamriel when the ancient &lt;a href=\"Aldmeri\"&gt;Aldmeri&lt;/a&gt; first arrived. They have a primitive language and tribal social structure, and worship a god known as \"Muluk,\" who is theorized to be &lt;a href=\"Malacath\"&gt;Malacath&lt;/a&gt;. Depending on the tribe, they may be led by a Warlord (also known as Warchiefs, typically the biggest and strongest Goblin in the tribe) or by a magic-using shaman (who can be male or female). They frequently come into conflict with any other races they cross paths with, though have been known to live peacefully with the Orcs. They are also frequently enslaved by other races to serve as labor. Furthermore, Goblin tribes are also known to wage wars between each other.\nThere are numerous varieties of Goblin, with some regional differences. On average, they stand 3-5 feet tall, though historically, a race of giant Goblins native to the &lt;a href=\"Alik%27r%20Desert\"&gt;Alik'r Desert&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Hammerfell\"&gt;Hammerfell&lt;/a&gt; stood over 8 feet tall. They typically have green-skin, yellow eyes with slitted pupils, a hunched-over posture which sometimes includes a full blown hunchback, pointed ears, and fangs.\nGoblins have been known to use a number of Tamriel's vicious wildlife species in this role. For example, the &lt;a href=\"Shadowsilk%20tribe\"&gt;Shadowsilk tribe&lt;/a&gt; managed to tame\u00a0&lt;a href=\"giant%20spider\"&gt;giant spider&lt;/a&gt;s\u00a0while other Goblins tribes have done this with\u00a0giant &lt;a href=\"rat\"&gt;rat&lt;/a&gt;s and &lt;a href=\"Durzog\"&gt;Durzog&lt;/a&gt;s. \nBehavior.\nWhen in battle, goblins use their weapons and endurance to deal quick damage to their foes; Goblin Warlords use physical strength to kill intruders in their homes while Goblin witches use their power of magic to kill their enemies.\nWhile they are indeed very war-like and frequently come into conflict with any other intelligent races they cross paths with, their interactions with Orcs and the researcher in\u00a0\"&lt;a href=\"Sacred%20Rites%20of%20the%20Stonechewers\"&gt;Sacred Rites of the Stonechewers&lt;/a&gt;\"\u00a0show they can see other species as something besides an opportunity to pillage."}

These ranks include warriors, such as skirmishers and berserkers, and leaders, such as witches, shamans, and chiefs.\nThey also separate themselves among clans which control their own territory, which are usually &lt;a href=\"Caves%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;caves&lt;/a&gt;. There are also rumors that they worship &lt;a href=\"Malacath\"&gt;Malacath&lt;/a&gt;. While there is enough information to understand that goblins have more intelligence and organizational skills than a &lt;a href=\"Mudcrab%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;Mudcrab&lt;/a&gt;,\u00a0they are certainly not considered 'civilized' or sapient by the other &lt;a href=\"Races%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;races&lt;/a&gt;, and there is no evidence of any peaceful interaction between goblins and the other races.\nHabitats.\nGoblins tend to live underground or in dark caves and mines, feeding on &lt;a href=\"rat%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;rat&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Rat%20Meat%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;meat&lt;/a&gt;. Many goblin abodes have roasted rats or rat pens.\nAppearances in other games.\nGoblins first appeared in ,\u00a0but were not in\u00a0. Initially, they were also not found in , but were later included in the expansion. The goblins did not make an appearance in however, as their role in \"Skyrim\" seems to be replaced by that of the &lt;a href=\"Falmer\"&gt;Falmer&lt;/a&gt; (and later &lt;a href=\"Riekling%20%28Dragonborn%29\"&gt;Rieklings&lt;/a&gt; in the expansion).\nGeneral types.\nThere are several general types of goblins:\nGeneral stats.\nGoblins demonstrate greater endurance and higher hit points than most humanoid races, such as Humans and &lt;a href=\"Ogre%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;Ogres&lt;/a&gt;. They wear their own undroppable armor and clothing, however, warrior-types typically wield one-handed blunt weapons and &lt;a href=\"Shields%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;shields&lt;/a&gt;, which can be dropped or looted.\nOtherwise, most goblin types have normal weaknesses, deal physical damage, and drop generic items and &lt;a href=\"Leveled%20Items%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;leveled weapons&lt;/a&gt;. There are exceptions to this, however, namely Shamans and Warlords.\nAt higher levels, it is possible to come across Goblin Warlords. Tall, fast, and physically powerful, they are very\u00a0effective shield users, and in turn overwhelm both shields and armor with powerful blows. Upon perceiving their enemies, Warlords tend to charge at full speed, then leap in with a strong forward attack.\nGoblin Shamans employ a variety of ranged magical attacks; in close combat, however, they will attempt to flee. Shamans typically conjure &lt;a href=\"Zombie%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;zombies&lt;/a&gt; and cast &lt;a href=\"Shock%20Damage%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;shock&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Frost%20Damage%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;frost&lt;/a&gt;, or poison spells. They drop &lt;a href=\"Staves%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;staves&lt;/a&gt; and (usually silver) &lt;a href=\"daggers%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;daggers&lt;/a&gt;.\nClans.\nThere are eight goblin clans scattered throughout &lt;a href=\"Cyrodiil\"&gt;Cyrodiil&lt;/a&gt;. Each has a \"home cave\" and a &lt;a href=\"Goblin%20Totem%20Staff\"&gt;Goblin Totem Staff&lt;/a&gt;.\nGoblin wars.\nGoblins often go to war with other goblin clans, usually because one clan has stolen another clan's\u00a0&lt;a href=\"Goblin%20Totem%20Staff\"&gt;Goblin Totem Staff&lt;/a&gt;.\nOne immediate example of this involves the White Skin Clan and the Sharp Tooth Clan, both of which can be found close to &lt;a href=\"Skingrad%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;Skingrad&lt;/a&gt;. In order to assert dominance or prove who is better, a clan may steal the totem staff of another clan, initiating a goblin war. Inside the cave of the Sharp Tooth clan, it is possible to find the White Skin's totem staff, along with White Skin Goblins combating the Sharp Tooth to get their staff back.\nUpon taking a goblin totem staff, there are two options; sell it, or toy with the goblins at their expense. To do this, simply deposit the staff anywhere, and the staff's respective clan will clamber around the area to protect it, no matter how far away it is. Alternatively, placing a goblin staff at a settlement or within a city will cause the clan to attack whoever is near it (note that the goblins will likely kill many, so it is not recommended to save after doing this, as many &lt;a href=\"Merchants%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;shopkeepers&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Factions%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;guild&lt;/a&gt; members etc. can be killed). Another option is to leave the staff near to, or within, another goblin clan's cave, causing the two groups to combat each other. Stealing all the staves in the game and putting them in one place may seem fun, but remember that such an action would cause excessive lag with the large amount of goblins on screen at once, so take caution to overdo it.\nHowever, this is only a small list of examples of what can be done. Stealing the totem staves and placing them around &lt;a href=\"Cyrodiil\"&gt;Cyrodiil&lt;/a&gt; can be endlessly fun. Caves filled with the most powerful of enemies are also entertaining ideas, as are placing them at &lt;a href=\"Daedra\"&gt;Daedra&lt;/a&gt;-infested &lt;a href=\"Ayleid%20Ruins%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;Ayleid Ruins&lt;/a&gt;, or even within &lt;a href=\"Cloud%20Ruler%20Temple%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;Cloud Ruler Temple&lt;/a&gt;, home of the &lt;a href=\"Blades%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;Blades&lt;/a&gt;. A staff can also be sold for a considerable sum, which is also an option worth considering to gain easy money.\nNote: If the Hero plans on initiating a goblin war, \"do not\" kill the respective shamans of each clan (or in the case of the White Skins, Goblin Jim). They do not respawn, and doing so will make it impossible to set off any conflict, as without a magical leader the clans cannot sense the whereabouts of their artifacts. It is best to kill the rest, take the Totem Staff, and spare the shamans."}

The form of clothing that these creatures wear varies from rank to rank. Goblin Officers, Goblin Bruisers and Goblin Handlers wear metal shoulder-guards on their left shoulder, as well as a human skull on the right. Common goblins seem to be wearing a form of ragged fabric clothing.\nThe highest ranked Goblins, the Goblin Warchiefs, wear unique masks accompanied by largely-scaled shoulder guard plating."}

He and his family wish to build a settlement at &lt;a href=\"Cropsford%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;Cropsford&lt;/a&gt;, but have been unable to do so due to two warring clans of &lt;a href=\"Goblin%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;Goblins&lt;/a&gt;.\nMirisa.\nTalk to &lt;a href=\"Mirisa%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;Mirisa&lt;/a&gt; to get the next part of this quest. She\u00a0says that the goblins at Cropsford are war parties from &lt;a href=\"Cracked%20Wood%20Cave%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;Cracked Wood Cave&lt;/a&gt; on their way to attack a rival tribe at Timberscar Cave (appears as &lt;a href=\"Timberscar%20Hollow%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;Timberscar Hollow&lt;/a&gt; on the &lt;a href=\"Hero%20of%20Kvatch\"&gt;Hero&lt;/a&gt;'s map). The Timberscar Cave goblins stole the Cracked Wood Cave tribe's Totem Head.\nWalkthrough.\nThere are several ways to finish this quest. The first way is to recover the Totem Head from the goblins in Timberscar Cave, which would stop the war between the two tribes and leave Cropsford in peace. The &lt;a href=\"Hero%20of%20Kvatch\"&gt;Hero&lt;/a&gt; could do this and not have to kill any goblins; sneaking in and stealing the Totem Head. The second way is to kill the shaman of Cracked Wood Cave, which should effectively destroy the tribe and stop their war parties from attacking Cropsford. A third method is to simply kill all of the goblins in one or both caves.\nOnce they either recover the Totem Head or kill the Shaman return to &lt;a href=\"Mirisa%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;Mirisa&lt;/a&gt;. If they took the Totem Head she will tell them that they can cause trouble by giving the Totem Head to a rival goblin tribe. Talk to Barthel Gernand to complete the quest. He promises them a hero's welcome in Cropsford once they have had a chance to establish the settlement.\nWhen returning to Cropsford after two weeks, be sure to locate a chest named \"Reward Chest\" on the second floor of &lt;a href=\"Bincals%27%20House\"&gt;Bincals' House&lt;/a&gt; underneath the stair to the third floor. It refills with &lt;a href=\"Septim%20%28Coin%29\"&gt;gold&lt;/a&gt; periodically which the Hero is free to take."}

As a result, he usually forfeits the bonuses that require subtlety and tact to accomplish, and instead charges in, kills everyone in sight, and then runs out.\nBackground.\nHe is often a counter to the members of the Brotherhood who counsel to employ stealthy tactics or actions. He focuses on the core issue, killing the target, and would rather forgo a bonus and openly kill the target instead of using quieter means. Despite his violent nature, he is immensely friendly. In addition to his non-stealthy nature, he wears leveled heavy armor instead of &lt;a href=\"Shrouded%20Armor%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;shrouded armor&lt;/a&gt; like most of the Brotherhood assassins.\nHe apparently has an ongoing romance with &lt;a href=\"Telaendril\"&gt;Telaendril&lt;/a&gt;. When asked about rumors, he says he possesses a set of her undergarments.\nInteractions.\nWhen asked about the &lt;a href=\"Hero%20of%20Kvatch\"&gt;Hero of Kvatch&lt;/a&gt;'s current contract, he offers advice like the rest of the Dark Brotherhood.\n&lt;a href=\"The%20Purification\"&gt;The Purification&lt;/a&gt;.\nGogron was killed along with the other assassins in the &lt;a href=\"Dark%20Brotherhood%20Sanctuary%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;Cheydinhal Sanctuary&lt;/a&gt; by the &lt;a href=\"Hero%20of%20Kvatch\"&gt;Hero&lt;/a&gt;.\nConversations.\nGogron: \"But why, Sister? What is the point? Why should anyone bother with all that sneaking and skulking?\"\nTelaendril: \"My dear Gogron, you are a life-taker for the Dark Brotherhood! Our very existence relies on shadow and deception. Do you not value our secrets?\"\nGogron: \"Yes, yes, of course I value our secrets, and I have never betrayed them! But using stealth to kill... It's just so... weak.\"\nTelaendril: \"But Brother, what of the contracts that require subtlety! You must at least strive to earn the bonuses that are offered?\"\nGogron: \"\"Bonuses? Ha ha ha ha ha! Useless, I say! &lt;a href=\"Septim%20%28Coin%29\"&gt;Gold&lt;/a&gt; and magical trinkets are no substitute for the freedom to slaughter anyone I please, at any time!\"\"\nTelaendril: \"Oh, Gogron!

{"id": "915490", "revid": "32911304", "url": "https://elderscrolls.fandom.com/wiki?curid=915490", "title": "Gold Coast", "text": "The Gold Coast or the Strident Coast is the western coast of the &lt;a href=\"Colovian%20West\"&gt;Colovian West&lt;/a&gt; within the province of &lt;a href=\"Cyrodiil\"&gt;Cyrodiil&lt;/a&gt;. The Gold Coast takes its name from the golden grasslands that stretch along the coast from the &lt;a href=\"Brena%20River\"&gt;Brena River&lt;/a&gt; to the &lt;a href=\"Strid%20River\"&gt;Strid River&lt;/a&gt;. Most the settlements found in the land are farmlands in between &lt;a href=\"Kvatch\"&gt;Kvatch&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Anvil\"&gt;Anvil&lt;/a&gt;.\nDescription.\nGeography.\nWestern Gold Coast.\nThe western Gold Coast consists of the beaches between the estuaries of the &lt;a href=\"Strid%20River\"&gt;Strid River&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Brena%20River\"&gt;Brena River&lt;/a&gt;. Most of the Gold Coast's activity occurs in this area as &lt;a href=\"Anvil\"&gt;Anvil&lt;/a&gt; is situated along the central bay. The majority of &lt;a href=\"County%20Anvil\"&gt;County Anvil&lt;/a&gt; is found along the coast. Underneath Anvil is the &lt;a href=\"Smuggler%27s%20Cave\"&gt;Smuggler's Cave&lt;/a&gt;, which many counts and pirate lords of Anvil have used as either a treasury or an escape route. The westernmost &lt;a href=\"Ayleid%20ruin\"&gt;Ayleid ruin&lt;/a&gt; in Cyrodiil, &lt;a href=\"Garlas%20Malatar\"&gt;Garlas Malatar&lt;/a&gt;, is found on the coast on the outskirts of Anvil.\nEastern Gold Coast.\nThe eastern Gold Coast is the central heartlands of western Cyrodiil. Much of the land is agricultural, especially around the outskirts of &lt;a href=\"Kvatch\"&gt;Kvatch&lt;/a&gt; which sits atop hills that overlook the entire area. This region is heavily religious, with the &lt;a href=\"Akatosh%20Chantry\"&gt;Akatosh Chantry&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Order%20of%20the%20Hour\"&gt;Order of the Hour&lt;/a&gt; having a strong presence here. The &lt;a href=\"Kvatch%20Arena\"&gt;Kvatch Arena&lt;/a&gt; is the main attraction of the eastern Gold Coast. The &lt;a href=\"Dark%20Brotherhood\"&gt;Dark Brotherhood&lt;/a&gt; also has a significant presence in the area, with two known sanctuaries in the area. The majority of &lt;a href=\"County%20Kvatch\"&gt;County Kvatch&lt;/a&gt; lies within here.\nOuter Gold Coast.\nThe outer Gold Coast refers to the land outside of &lt;a href=\"Varen%27s%20Wall%20%28Location%29\"&gt;Varen's Wall&lt;/a&gt; which was built during the &lt;a href=\"Colovian%20Revolt\"&gt;Colovian Revolt&lt;/a&gt;. This region is largely uninhabited and the only settlement is &lt;a href=\"Sutch\"&gt;Sutch&lt;/a&gt; which is not far from the northern gatehouse. The ruins of &lt;a href=\"Niryastare\"&gt;Niryastare&lt;/a&gt; is the only other notable landmark in the region. The wildlands are inhabited by Daedric cultists at the &lt;a href=\"Statue%20of%20Malacath\"&gt;Statue of Malacath&lt;/a&gt;, and there are various bandit encampments and redoubts moving northward. Most of &lt;a href=\"County%20Sutch\"&gt;County Sutch&lt;/a&gt; can be found here.\nFauna.\nNotable fauna.\nDire Wolves.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Dire%20Wolf\"&gt;Dire Wolves&lt;/a&gt; of the Gold Coast are a much stronger variant of the typical &lt;a href=\"Wolf\"&gt;Wolf&lt;/a&gt; found throughout the continent. Unlike regular wolves who hunt in packs, dire wolves are typically solitary predators. Taming a dire wolf is much more difficult to do, but citizens of Kvatch have been known to use such creatures as mounts or as auxiliary units. They are also intelligent creatures and are known for having a long memory, but they do not grasp the use of magic. Like pet dogs, they enjoy having their bellies scratched.\nGoblins.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Goblin\"&gt;Goblin&lt;/a&gt;s of the Gold Coast have a history of alliances forming a united group. As of &lt;a href=\"2E%20583\"&gt;2E 583&lt;/a&gt;, there were two main tribes, the &lt;a href=\"Long%20Tooth%20Tribe\"&gt;Long Tooth Tribe&lt;/a&gt; who claimed the northern land near &lt;a href=\"Knightsgrave\"&gt;Knightsgrave&lt;/a&gt; and the ruins of &lt;a href=\"Sutch\"&gt;Sutch&lt;/a&gt;, while the &lt;a href=\"Sharp%20Stick%20Tribe\"&gt;Sharp Stick Tribe&lt;/a&gt; claimed the southern hills around the &lt;a href=\"Strid%20River\"&gt;Strid River&lt;/a&gt;. Long ago, the Long Tooth consisted of three tribes, the &lt;a href=\"Long%20Claws\"&gt;Long Claws&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"Tooth%20Rocks\"&gt;Tooth Rocks&lt;/a&gt;, and the &lt;a href=\"Rock%20Sticks\"&gt;Rock Sticks&lt;/a&gt;. The Long Claws and the Tooth Rocks were originally from the &lt;a href=\"Colovian%20Highlands\"&gt;Colovian Highlands&lt;/a&gt; near &lt;a href=\"Chorrol\"&gt;Chorrol&lt;/a&gt; and warred against each other and they were eventually driven out by the &lt;a href=\"Fighters%20Guild\"&gt;Fighters Guild&lt;/a&gt; and into the Gold Coast. It was here that the two tribes saw the Rock Sticks as a common enemy and fought against that populous tribe. Eventually, the three tribes banded together as the Long Tooth, claiming northern Anvil County. The Sharp Stick tribe is an amalgamation of various smaller tribes, The &lt;a href=\"Eye%20Sticks\"&gt;Eye Sticks&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"Sharp%20Rocks\"&gt;Sharp Rocks&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"Shatter%20Bones\"&gt;Shatter Bones&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"Blood%20Skulls\"&gt;Blood Skulls&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Gut%20Blades\"&gt;Gut Blades&lt;/a&gt; that coalesced after significant internecine warfare.\nRiver Troll.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Troll\"&gt;Troll&lt;/a&gt; is a common creature throughout the provinces, usually found in secluded caves and isolated locations. There are several variants depending on the environment, such as the &lt;a href=\"Frost%20Troll\"&gt;Frost Troll&lt;/a&gt; in the province of &lt;a href=\"Skyrim\"&gt;Skyrim&lt;/a&gt;, or the &lt;a href=\"Swamp%20Troll\"&gt;Swamp Troll&lt;/a&gt; in the deep region of the &lt;a href=\"Nibenay%20Basin\"&gt;Nibenay Basin&lt;/a&gt;. The &lt;a href=\"River%20Troll\"&gt;River Troll&lt;/a&gt; variant is found in the riverways of Cyrodiil, primarily the &lt;a href=\"Niben%20River\"&gt;Niben River&lt;/a&gt; and the twin rivers of the Gold Coast. River Trolls are hunted in the county of &lt;a href=\"Sutch\"&gt;Sutch&lt;/a&gt;, where their carcasses are considered valuable. They resemble the typical Troll, but their hide is scaled and silver-blue in color. Their bodies have several river hunting adaptations including fangs and claws to hunt fish, webbed hands and razor sharp teeth. Like other trolls, they live in caves and hidden alcoves, but their diet typically consists of common river fish, &lt;a href=\"Mudcrab\"&gt;Mudcrab&lt;/a&gt;s, and even &lt;a href=\"Crocodile\"&gt;Crocodile&lt;/a&gt;s.\nNixad.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Nixad\"&gt;Nixad&lt;/a&gt; are mischievous humanoid insects that live primarily in the &lt;a href=\"Colovian%20West\"&gt;Colovian West&lt;/a&gt;, originally living in the region of the &lt;a href=\"Great%20Forest\"&gt;Great Forest&lt;/a&gt;, before migrating into the Gold Coast. The Nixad is reminiscent of the &lt;a href=\"Faerie\"&gt;Faerie&lt;/a&gt;, more specifically, the &lt;a href=\"Pixies\"&gt;Pixies&lt;/a&gt; of Hammerfell. They live in glades and meadows throughout the Gold Coast. They take pleasure in other people's pain and are known to laugh and mock those in obvious irritation. According to some folktales, the Nixad like to pluck the eyes of children and roll them in piles of &lt;a href=\"Moon%20Sugar\"&gt;Moon Sugar&lt;/a&gt; and eat them. The only way to prevent this is to distract them by humiliating the possible victim. Despite their cruel nature, they can be loyal and friendly pets. A unique type of Nixad, the &lt;a href=\"Orchid%20Nixad\"&gt;Orchid Nixad&lt;/a&gt;, are revered by worshippers of &lt;a href=\"Dibella\"&gt;Dibella&lt;/a&gt; and they can be found in places that worship her such as the Chapel of Dibella in Anvil..\nMinotaur.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Minotaur\"&gt;Minotaur&lt;/a&gt; is a type of &lt;a href=\"beastfolk\"&gt;beastfolk&lt;/a&gt; found in the Gold Coast and a common type of beastfolk in the Empire. They are more tribal and aggressive than the &lt;a href=\"Orsimer\"&gt;Orsimer&lt;/a&gt; of the Greater Reach. The Minotaurs are also known as \"Man-Bulls\" after their physiology. Minotaurs have large and hulking bodies as compared to man and mer. Despite the abundance of male Minotaurs, there are, in fact, female Minotaurs. The most well-known Minotaur was &lt;a href=\"Belharza\"&gt;Belharza&lt;/a&gt;, the second &lt;a href=\"Emperor\"&gt;Emperor&lt;/a&gt; of the &lt;a href=\"First%20Empire\"&gt;First Empire&lt;/a&gt; and the son of &lt;a href=\"St.%20Alessia\"&gt;St. Alessia&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Morihaus\"&gt;Morihaus&lt;/a&gt;. Minotaurs were devouts of St. Alessia and upheld this in some ways even when they were shunned by the &lt;a href=\"Alessian%20Order\"&gt;Alessian Order&lt;/a&gt; during their persecution of non-humans. Minotaurs in the Gold Coast live near ruins, primarily the ruins of &lt;a href=\"Knightsgrave\"&gt;Knightsgrave&lt;/a&gt;, which is a mausoleum belonging to the &lt;a href=\"Order%20of%20the%20Hour\"&gt;Order of the Hour&lt;/a&gt; and a site of worship for &lt;a href=\"Akatosh\"&gt;Akatosh&lt;/a&gt; during the Alessian Empire. Minotaurs have a unique type of armor, partly barbaric in design but with Alessian influences. Even though they are shunned in modern-day society, people of the modern age have recognized their once illustrious past in the early first era. \nOther fauna.\nThe following fauna can also be encountered in the Gold Coast:\nFlora.\nThe region of the Gold Coast takes its name from the gold colored grassland that stretches between the &lt;a href=\"Brena%20River\"&gt;Brena River&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Strid%20River\"&gt;Strid River&lt;/a&gt;. The grassland then extends beyond the region into the north from the &lt;a href=\"Colovian%20Highlands\"&gt;Colovian Highlands&lt;/a&gt; and as far as the ruins of &lt;a href=\"Lipsand%20Tarn\"&gt;Lipsand Tarn&lt;/a&gt;. The trees in the region consist of oak, beech, and ash, all of which are utilized in Imperial manufacturing and construction, especially in Colovia. The &lt;a href=\"Water%20Hyacinth\"&gt;Water Hyacinth&lt;/a&gt; is common in the Gold Coast and found in the southern point of the region near the Strid River. One of the most abundant of flora found in the Gold Coast is the &lt;a href=\"Aloe%20Vera\"&gt;Aloe Vera&lt;/a&gt; in contrast to their being unavailable elsewhere in Cyrodiil. The &lt;a href=\"Goldenrod\"&gt;Goldenrod&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Lady%27s%20Mantle\"&gt;Lady's Mantle&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Fennel\"&gt;Fennel&lt;/a&gt; can be found further inland. A unique flower called the &lt;a href=\"Wyrd%20Flower\"&gt;Wyrd Flower&lt;/a&gt; grows in the ruins of &lt;a href=\"Garlas%20Malatar\"&gt;Garlas Malatar&lt;/a&gt; and other Ayleid ruins in the area.\nGovernment.\nCyrodiil is a well-organized country, with subdivisions called &lt;a href=\"Counties\"&gt;Counties&lt;/a&gt; partitioning the whole. The Gold Coast houses three distinct counties: Anvil, Kvatch, and Sutch. Each of these are ruled by a &lt;a href=\"count\"&gt;count&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"countess\"&gt;countess&lt;/a&gt; who rules by either hereditary accession or through the people's choice. The Gold Coast itself is a geographic indicator and not a political one, so the region does not have a political center or regional ruler. The &lt;a href=\"Colovian%20Estates\"&gt;Colovian Estates&lt;/a&gt; were an autonomous government that spread from Anvil to &lt;a href=\"Falkreath\"&gt;Falkreath&lt;/a&gt;. The &lt;a href=\"Colovian\"&gt;Colovian&lt;/a&gt; people are strong and hardy, a working people that are much more active than those of the &lt;a href=\"Nibenay\"&gt;Nibenay&lt;/a&gt;.\nReligion.\nThe Empire has established the worship of the &lt;a href=\"Nine%20Divines\"&gt;Nine Divines&lt;/a&gt; as the main religion in all of the provinces and it is a combination and generalization of several different pantheons. In the Gold Coast, the most prominent divine is &lt;a href=\"Akatosh\"&gt;Akatosh&lt;/a&gt;, the Dragon God of Time and Chief Deity of the Nine Divines. Kvatch has been historically known as a city of Akatosh, with the &lt;a href=\"Cathedral%20of%20Akatosh\"&gt;Cathedral of Akatosh&lt;/a&gt; having great significance in County Kvatch. The &lt;a href=\"Akatosh%20Chantry\"&gt;Akatosh Chantry&lt;/a&gt; is the main cult of Akatosh worship and it has chapters throughout the Empire, including in &lt;a href=\"Wayrest\"&gt;Wayrest&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Bergama\"&gt;Bergama&lt;/a&gt;. Akatosh played a prominent role in the &lt;a href=\"Oblivion%20Crisis\"&gt;Oblivion Crisis&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"3E%20433\"&gt;3E 433&lt;/a&gt;, when &lt;a href=\"Martin%20Septim\"&gt;Martin Septim&lt;/a&gt; sacrificed himself to serve as the Avatar of Akatosh and cast &lt;a href=\"Mehrunes%20Dagon\"&gt;Mehrunes Dagon&lt;/a&gt; back into &lt;a href=\"Oblivion\"&gt;Oblivion&lt;/a&gt;. The &lt;a href=\"Order%20of%20the%20Hour\"&gt;Order of the Hour&lt;/a&gt; is the military arm of the Chantry and they enforced the will of the Chantry. They had a significant role in the Gold Coast during the Interregnum and it is common knowledge that the Akatosh Chantry are enemies of &lt;a href=\"House%20of%20Dibella\"&gt;House of Dibella&lt;/a&gt;. \nThe House of Dibella is the central cult that worships &lt;a href=\"Dibella\"&gt;Dibella&lt;/a&gt;, the Goddess of Beauty and Love. She is one of the more popular ones, with devotees from as far as &lt;a href=\"Markarth\"&gt;Markarth&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Tigonus\"&gt;Tigonus&lt;/a&gt;. Anvil is the center of Dibella worship in Cyrodiil and the &lt;a href=\"Chapel%20of%20Dibella\"&gt;Chapel of Dibella&lt;/a&gt; sits in Eastern Anvil. \nCulture.\nThe Gold Coast is rich in culture and the County of Anvil is a retreat that many nobles go to, similar to the &lt;a href=\"Kingdom%20of%20Sentinel\"&gt;Kingdom of Sentinel&lt;/a&gt; in the north. The markets are always in stock with exotic wares and the delicacies of Anvil are served in many exquisite restaurants from Eastgate and Westgate. The beaches, however, are the primary focus of Anvil's tourists. Cozy cottages dot the beach for those who could not afford the villas that nobles sleep in. Kvatch was a place of worship and reflection with the &lt;a href=\"Cathedral%20of%20Akatosh\"&gt;Cathedral of Akatosh&lt;/a&gt; prominent in the city square. The &lt;a href=\"Kvatch%20Arena\"&gt;Kvatch Arena&lt;/a&gt; was another attraction with warriors from all over pitted against various enemies. It was the only arena in Cyrodiil other than the one in the &lt;a href=\"Imperial%20City\"&gt;Imperial City&lt;/a&gt;, the latter of which still stands. On the &lt;a href=\"Gold%20Road\"&gt;Gold Road&lt;/a&gt; between Anvil and Kvatch is a series of private estates and isolated inns such as the historical &lt;a href=\"Gottshaw%20Inn%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;Gottshaw Inn&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"Lord%20Drad%27s%20Estate\"&gt;Lord Drad's Estate&lt;/a&gt;.\nEconomy.\nAnvil is a prominent port receiving goods from ships plying the &lt;a href=\"Abecean%20Sea\"&gt;Abecean Sea&lt;/a&gt; that are bound for Cyrodiil. As such, the County of Anvil has been a branch location for both the &lt;a href=\"East%20Empire%20Company\"&gt;East Empire Company&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Gold%20Coast%20Trading%20Company%20%28Faction%29\"&gt;Gold Coast Trading Company&lt;/a&gt;. Both companies also benefited from the &lt;a href=\"Imperial%20Navy\"&gt;Imperial Navy&lt;/a&gt; being stationed in Anvil to protect them from pirate activity on the Abecean Sea. Inland, lumber is a major trade. Anvil Harbor is also a place of rest for passing sailors that move throughout the Abecean and reside in &lt;a href=\"The%20Fo%27c%27s%27le\"&gt;The Fo'c's'le&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href=\"Skooma\"&gt;Skooma&lt;/a&gt; runs in the Gold Coast are also smuggled through Anvil Port until they enter the rest of the province.\nHistory.\n&lt;a href=\"First%20Era\"&gt;First Era&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe Alessian Empire.\nSometime during the early part of the First Era, the &lt;a href=\"Ayleid\"&gt;Ayleid&lt;/a&gt;s migrated to Cyrodiil, expanding their Kingdom from both the east and the west. One of the settlements built at that time was &lt;a href=\"Garlas%20Malatar\"&gt;Garlas Malatar&lt;/a&gt;, a temple city dedicated to &lt;a href=\"Meridia\"&gt;Meridia&lt;/a&gt;. In &lt;a href=\"1E%20243\"&gt;1E 243&lt;/a&gt;, Nedic slaves under the command of &lt;a href=\"Saint%20Alessia\"&gt;Saint Alessia&lt;/a&gt; conquered the land and established the &lt;a href=\"First%20Empire\"&gt;First Empire&lt;/a&gt;. They spread across the land and this is when the current cities of Cyrodiil were founded, including towns in the Western Gold Coast. The Nedic Kingdom of the Strident Coast ruled out of &lt;a href=\"Kvatch\"&gt;Kvatch&lt;/a&gt;. This continued for several years until the arrival of the &lt;a href=\"Colovian\"&gt;Colovian&lt;/a&gt;s, Imperial Westerners who hailed from &lt;a href=\"Skingrad\"&gt;Skingrad&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Chorrol\"&gt;Chorrol&lt;/a&gt;. The Colovians overwhelmed the Strident Nedes and took over their land, bringing the Gold Coast into the &lt;a href=\"Colovian%20Estates\"&gt;Colovian Estates&lt;/a&gt;. The Estates were an autonomous government which consisted of West Cyrodiil and nations along the outer border such as &lt;a href=\"Arenthia\"&gt;Arenthia&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Elinhir\"&gt;Elinhir&lt;/a&gt;. At the time, Kvatch was a juggernaut among the Colovian Estates and had a strong rivalry with the Kingdom of Skingrad in the east. With their land gone, the Nedes retreated north to &lt;a href=\"Hammerfell\"&gt;Hammerfell&lt;/a&gt; where they founded &lt;a href=\"Skyreach\"&gt;Skyreach&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe Tale of Lord Nunex Faleria.\nDuring the early years of the &lt;a href=\"Alessian%20Doctrines\"&gt;Alessian Doctrines&lt;/a&gt;, three leaders ruled over Kvatch as a council. The names of two have been lost in history. The third, &lt;a href=\"Lord%20Nunex%20Faleria\"&gt;Lord Nunex Faleria&lt;/a&gt;, was in love with an &lt;a href=\"Ayleid\"&gt;Ayleid&lt;/a&gt; scholar from the city of &lt;a href=\"Nenalata\"&gt;Nenalata&lt;/a&gt;. To protect his love, Nunex established a stronghold deep in the Gold Coast and named it &lt;a href=\"Fort%20Faleria\"&gt;Fort Faleria&lt;/a&gt;. To protect it further, he used magic, hired workers, and a tribe of &lt;a href=\"Minotaur\"&gt;Minotaur&lt;/a&gt;s to guard it. As time went on, Nunex and Lady Faleria had a family, with three children. Eventually, Lady Faleria died and Nunex built a brass tomb for her in Fort Faleria.\nFaleria's Demise.\nDuring his and his family's residency at the fort, Lord Faleria delved into dark magic. One day, the youngest child escaped and met a young woman, whom he fell in love with. When her family discovered his Elven heritage, she was forced to confess and word of this brought the Empire to Fort Faleria. Lord Faleria committed a gruesome ritual, which ended with his family's death and the destruction of Fort Faleria. With his remaining strength, he buried his family on the surface and remained in the ruins of Fort Faleria, where it faded into obscurity as Tribune's Folly.\nRislav the Righteous and the Coup at Skingrad.\nDuring the fifth century, Kvatch was ruled by &lt;a href=\"King%20Justinius\"&gt;King Justinius&lt;/a&gt; and it fought against &lt;a href=\"Skingrad\"&gt;Skingrad&lt;/a&gt; in minor skirmishes over common territory in the &lt;a href=\"Colovian%20West\"&gt;Colovian West&lt;/a&gt;. This would last until &lt;a href=\"1E%20472\"&gt;1E 472&lt;/a&gt;, when the marriage of Princess &lt;a href=\"Belene\"&gt;Belene&lt;/a&gt; of Kvatch and &lt;a href=\"Rislav%20Larich\"&gt;Rislav Larich&lt;/a&gt; of Skingrad ended the fighting. Rislav remained in the Court of Kvatch for six years after that until when in &lt;a href=\"1E%20478\"&gt;1E 478&lt;/a&gt;, an unknown disease spread throughout Cyrodiil. The disease killed most of the Larich family in Skingrad, leaving only Rislav and his older brother, &lt;a href=\"Dorald%20Larich\"&gt;Dorald Larich&lt;/a&gt;. When news of this was received by the brothers, Dorald left for Skingrad where he took control of the town. His first decree was to have Skingrad cede to the &lt;a href=\"Alessian%20Empire\"&gt;Alessian Empire&lt;/a&gt;, which outraged and shocked the Colovian West, and Rislav and the Court of Kvatch even more so. Rislav, his wife, and a militia of Kvatchian Soldiers attacked Skingrad during the &lt;a href=\"Coup%20at%20Skingrad\"&gt;Coup at Skingrad&lt;/a&gt;. Rislav decapitated Dorald and took the position of King of Skingrad. From then on, the Colovian West rebelled against the Alessian Empire, including various acts of rebellion such as the &lt;a href=\"Battle%20of%20Glenumbra%20Moors%20%28Event%29\"&gt;Battle of Glenumbria Moors&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Battle%20of%20Sungard\"&gt;Battle of Sungard&lt;/a&gt;.\nBendu Olo of Anvil and the All Flags Navy.\nIn &lt;a href=\"1E%202200\"&gt;1E 2200&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"Sload\"&gt;Sload&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"Thras\"&gt;Thras&lt;/a&gt; had unleashed a horrifying plague called the &lt;a href=\"Thrassian%20Plague\"&gt;Thrassian Plague&lt;/a&gt; throughout the Western World. Symptoms of the plague included an intense, unquenchable thirst. The people would drink and drink until their bones cracked and their flesh bulged. The Plague spread all over the continent and of its most notable victims were in the area later known as the &lt;a href=\"Corgrad%20Wastes\"&gt;Corgrad Wastes&lt;/a&gt;. The disease caused a drastic decrease in population in and around the &lt;a href=\"Iliac%20Bay\"&gt;Iliac Bay&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href=\"Bendu%20Olo\"&gt;Bendu Olo&lt;/a&gt;, the King of &lt;a href=\"Anvil\"&gt;Anvil&lt;/a&gt;, amassed a force unlike which the provinces would not witness for many years. Bendu created the &lt;a href=\"All%20Flags%20Navy\"&gt;All Flags Navy&lt;/a&gt;, drawn from the ranks of kings and barons of the Western World from &lt;a href=\"Summerset%20Isles\"&gt;Summerset Isles&lt;/a&gt; to &lt;a href=\"Hammerfell\"&gt;Hammerfell&lt;/a&gt;, and even from far away &lt;a href=\"Black%20Marsh\"&gt;Black Marsh&lt;/a&gt;. Bendu set sail from Anvil to the archipelago of Thras and sacked the &lt;a href=\"Coral%20Tower\"&gt;Coral Tower&lt;/a&gt; and subsequently sank Thras into the &lt;a href=\"Sea%20of%20Pearls\"&gt;Sea of Pearls&lt;/a&gt;. Many notable figures aided Bendu in battle, such as &lt;a href=\"Baron-Captain%20Olsien%20Guy%20Mard\"&gt;Baron-Captain Olsien Guy Mard&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"Evermore\"&gt;Evermore&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Captain%20One-Eye\"&gt;Captain Tsona-Ei&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"Alten%20Corimont\"&gt;Alten Corimont&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Syrabane\"&gt;Syrabane&lt;/a&gt;, an Altmer warlock who became a part of the &lt;a href=\"Aldmeri%20Pantheon\"&gt;Aldmeri Pantheon&lt;/a&gt; thereafter. When Bendu returned to Anvil, he was proclaimed a hero and the fortress built outside the harbor town was converted into &lt;a href=\"Castle%20Anvil\"&gt;Castle Anvil&lt;/a&gt;. The events that transpired caused Colovia to overshadow &lt;a href=\"Nibenay\"&gt;Nibenay&lt;/a&gt; in the east and this would bring about the &lt;a href=\"War%20of%20Righteousness\"&gt;War of Righteousness&lt;/a&gt; in the late First Era. This war led the end of the Alessian Empire with the razing of the Order's monastery at &lt;a href=\"Lake%20Canulus\"&gt;Lake Canulus&lt;/a&gt;.\n&lt;a href=\"Second%20Era\"&gt;Second Era&lt;/a&gt;.\nCount Carolus Aquilarios and Varen's Wall.\nTo protect his original domain, the Gold Coast, Varen Aquilarios commissioned the construction of a stone wall to defend against attacks by Leovic's forces. This wall was designed by &lt;a href=\"Jaros%20Truptor\"&gt;Jaros Truptor&lt;/a&gt; and named &lt;a href=\"Varen%27s%20Wall%20%28Location%29\"&gt;Varen's Wall&lt;/a&gt;. Because of this, the Gold Coast did not fall into ruin like the rest of Cyrodiil. Varen took the &lt;a href=\"Second%20Legion\"&gt;Second Legion&lt;/a&gt; from the Gold Coast and used it in his fight against the Emperor. He left the throne of Kvatch to his nephew, &lt;a href=\"Carolus%20Aquilarios\"&gt;Carolus Aquilarios&lt;/a&gt;, whom he believed was worthy of protecting the county. Shortly after this, &lt;a href=\"Ephrem%20Benirus\"&gt;Ephrem Benirus&lt;/a&gt;, the Count of &lt;a href=\"Anvil\"&gt;Anvil&lt;/a&gt; and Imperial Praefect decided to rally his forces and try to take control of Kvatch. With what little he had, Carolus had defended Kvatch from Count Benirus and he was promoted to Count of Kvatch. Benirus attempted to take Kvatch a total of three times, each time with dwindling forces. He eventually gave up and lost Anvil to &lt;a href=\"Fortunata%20ap%20Dugal\"&gt;Fortunata ap Dugal&lt;/a&gt; of the &lt;a href=\"Red%20Sails\"&gt;Red Sails&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe Wolf of Kvatch.\nDue to his bravery, Carolus was given the name the Wolf of Kvatch and this marked the start of using the wolf as the symbol of the county. Things became much harder for Carolus when &lt;a href=\"Artorius%20Ponticus\"&gt;Artorius Ponticus&lt;/a&gt;, the Primate of the Order, took an interest in expanding the Order's power over Kvatch and attempted and failed to overpower Carolus and his Kvatch Guard. Eventually in &lt;a href=\"2E%20582\"&gt;2E 582&lt;/a&gt;, Varen disappeared from the Imperial City and the &lt;a href=\"Planemeld\"&gt;Planemeld&lt;/a&gt; arrived. With the Ruby Throne empty, the &lt;a href=\"Alliance%20War\"&gt;Alliance War&lt;/a&gt; advanced into Cyrodiil, waging war across the land. Once again, Varen's Wall spared Kvatch from destruction.\nThe Order of the Hour.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Akatosh%20Chantry\"&gt;Akatosh Chantry&lt;/a&gt; is located in Kvatch. During the &lt;a href=\"Interregnum\"&gt;Interregnum&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"Longhouse%20Emperors\"&gt;Longhouse Emperors&lt;/a&gt; under &lt;a href=\"Durcorach%20the%20Black%20Drake\"&gt;Durcorach the Black Drake&lt;/a&gt; had been formed from &lt;a href=\"Reachmen\"&gt;Reachmen&lt;/a&gt; Emperors. Given the Daedra worship that the Reachmen practiced, many believed that a purge against worship of the Divines would occur. Many took up arms, preparing for such an event. One such person was &lt;a href=\"Cavor%20Merula\"&gt;Cavor Merula&lt;/a&gt;, who had re-established the &lt;a href=\"Order%20of%20the%20Hour\"&gt;Order of the Hour&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"2E%20432\"&gt;2E 432&lt;/a&gt; to protect the Chantry and the treasures stored within the vaults. The Order recruited devoted priests and soldiers of Akatosh and trained every day. The anticipated purge never came and the Order remained as sworn protectors of the Akatosh Cathedral.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Kvatch%20Bread%20Riots\"&gt;Kvatch Bread Riots&lt;/a&gt; occurred in &lt;a href=\"2E%20467\"&gt;2E 467&lt;/a&gt; when Kvatch had suffered from the &lt;a href=\"Red%20Wheat%20Blight\"&gt;Red Wheat Blight&lt;/a&gt; that killed off the crops for the second year in a row. Feeling that the Akatosh Chantry was not doing enough to rectify the situation, &lt;a href=\"Gruff%20Bojour\"&gt;Gruff Bojour&lt;/a&gt; incited a mob riot outside the Cathedral, with the intent of inflicting violence and making their disdain known to the Chantry. But the Order of the Hour had prepared for this and &lt;a href=\"Sister%20Severa\"&gt;Sister Severa&lt;/a&gt; and her squadron slaughtered the rioters before they took action. The Primate at the time decided to pray for the passing of the blight and it disappeared after the next season passed. The Order also saved &lt;a href=\"Primate%20Phrastus\"&gt;Primate Phrastus&lt;/a&gt; from an assassination attempt in &lt;a href=\"2E%20540\"&gt;2E 540&lt;/a&gt; and saved priests from a bandit caravan in &lt;a href=\"2E%20561\"&gt;2E 561&lt;/a&gt;. Anyone who recognized Akatosh as their divine savior was protected by the Order.\nThe Pirate Queen of the Gold Coast and the Red Sails.\nIn &lt;a href=\"2E%20576\"&gt;2E 576&lt;/a&gt;, the Gold Coast had become an independent kingdom separate from Cyrodiil when &lt;a href=\"Varen%27s%20Wall%20%28Location%29\"&gt;Varen's Wall&lt;/a&gt; was finished on the Gold Coast border from the &lt;a href=\"Colovian%20Estates\"&gt;Colovian Estates&lt;/a&gt;. The &lt;a href=\"Imperial%20Navy\"&gt;Imperial Navy&lt;/a&gt; left the Gold Coast to face &lt;a href=\"Varen%20Aquilarios\"&gt;Varen Aquilarios&lt;/a&gt;' rebellion in the &lt;a href=\"Heartlands\"&gt;Heartlands&lt;/a&gt;. The &lt;a href=\"Red%20Sails\"&gt;Red Sails&lt;/a&gt; Pirates of the &lt;a href=\"Abecean%20Sea\"&gt;Abecean Sea&lt;/a&gt; arrived into the Anvil Bay with a large fleet and took control of Anvil in a heartbeat. Fortunata ap Dugal had taken the role of Provincial Governor of the Gold Coast. &lt;a href=\"Governor%20Fortunata%20ap%20Dugal\"&gt;Governor Fortunata ap Dugal&lt;/a&gt; ruled Anvil with an iron grip and was considered a ruthless dictator among her people. However, Dugal's reign kept the region controlled and prevented anarchy at multiple different times. Her Red Sails became a private militia in a similar vein to the &lt;a href=\"Stormcloaks\"&gt;Stormcloak Rebellion&lt;/a&gt; in Eastern &lt;a href=\"Skyrim\"&gt;Skyrim&lt;/a&gt;, to benefit her needs and enforce her political beliefs.\nThe Independent Gold Coast and the Strident Triumvirate.\nFortunata ap Dugal would soon take action as she began her attempt to take over Kvatch. Fortunata declared the Gold Coast as an independent state from the rest of Cyrodiil in &lt;a href=\"2E%20579\"&gt;2E 579&lt;/a&gt; at a time when the &lt;a href=\"Soulburst\"&gt;Soulburst&lt;/a&gt; occurred, the &lt;a href=\"Imperial%20City\"&gt;Imperial City&lt;/a&gt; was in shambles, and the Daedric Hordes from &lt;a href=\"Coldharbour\"&gt;Coldharbour&lt;/a&gt; under the command of &lt;a href=\"Molag%20Bal\"&gt;Molag Bal&lt;/a&gt; took over Central Cyrodiil. This was during the reign of &lt;a href=\"Clivia%20Tharn\"&gt;Clivia Tharn&lt;/a&gt; as Empress-Regent. The Gold Coast, despite being ruled by a Pirate Queen, had prospered amidst the destruction of the heartland. Governor Fortunata pressed Kvatch to join her through diplomatic channels, though this was an underhanded offer. Count Carolus Aquilarios denied her advances, and so the Red Sails would harass Kvatch by disrupting the trade flow on the &lt;a href=\"Gold%20Road\"&gt;Gold Road&lt;/a&gt;. Feeling threatened, Count Carolus had sent the &lt;a href=\"Kvatch%20Warders\"&gt;Kvatch Warders&lt;/a&gt; on the outskirts of Kvatch to confront the Red Sails. Both groups met each other outside Gottshaw Inn. The Warders quickly defeated a motley crew of Anvil warriors until a raging horde of pirates surrounded them. This event was known as the &lt;a href=\"Gottshaw%20Massacre\"&gt;Gottshaw Massacre&lt;/a&gt;. To prevent a war, Count Carolus swore loyalty to Anvil, losing significant rule. During this conflict, the Order of the Hour, under the command of Primate Artorius Ponticus, had risen, threatening the Court of Kvatch's power in their own city. The Gold Coast then was a triumvirate of rulers: Count Carolus Aquilarios of Kvatch, Governor Fortunata ap Dugal, and Primate Artorius. This would continue, even into the &lt;a href=\"Alliance%20War\"&gt;Alliance War&lt;/a&gt;, in which the Gold Coast was neutral.\nEnter the Dark Brotherhood.\nIn &lt;a href=\"2E%20583\"&gt;2E 583&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"Dark%20Brotherhood\"&gt;Dark Brotherhood&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"Colovian%20West\"&gt;Colovian West&lt;/a&gt; had made a resurgence in the independent kingdom of the &lt;a href=\"Gold%20Coast\"&gt;Gold Coast&lt;/a&gt; and had made several notable assassinations in places such as Anvil and &lt;a href=\"Kvatch\"&gt;Kvatch&lt;/a&gt;. One of their first assassinations was &lt;a href=\"Lord%20Quintus%20Jarol\"&gt;Lord Quintus Jarol&lt;/a&gt; at his &lt;a href=\"Jarol%20Estate\"&gt;Estate&lt;/a&gt; north of Anvil and &lt;a href=\"Grand%20Sermonizer%20Fithia\"&gt;Grand Sermonizer Fithia at-Himah&lt;/a&gt;. Groups such as the &lt;a href=\"Order%20of%20the%20Hour\"&gt;Order of the Hour&lt;/a&gt; began to antagonize the Brotherhood in the hopes to destroy them.\nThe Dark Brotherhood and The Order of the Hour.\nIn &lt;a href=\"2E%20583\"&gt;2E 583&lt;/a&gt;, Carolus Aquilarios continued to rule over Kvatch. The &lt;a href=\"Dark%20Brotherhood%20%28Online%20Faction%29\"&gt;Dark Brotherhood's&lt;/a&gt; first notable target that year, &lt;a href=\"Quintus%20Jarol\"&gt;Quintus Jarol&lt;/a&gt;, was an Imperial nobleman living near Anvil. The Dark Brotherhood became known throughout the region, bringing them to the attention of the leaders of both Anvil and Kvatch, as well as making the Order of the Hour take action. &lt;a href=\"Fithia%20at-Himah\"&gt;Fithia at-Himah&lt;/a&gt;, the Grand Sermonizer of the Chantry, started a mission to preach against the Brotherhood in an attempt to bring them out of the shadows. Priests of Akatosh were killed as they started to preach in the streets of Kvatch. Eventually, At-Himah was able to capture &lt;a href=\"Cimbar\"&gt;Cimbar&lt;/a&gt; of the Brotherhood with the help of &lt;a href=\"the%20Black%20Dragon\"&gt;the Black Dragon&lt;/a&gt;, a mysterious warrior of Akatosh. As the Black Dragon was leaving the &lt;a href=\"At-Himah%20Family%20Estate\"&gt;At-Himah Family Estate&lt;/a&gt;, the Brotherhood made their move and killed Fithia. This would lead to an all-out hidden war between the Brotherhood and the Order.\nOddly enough, &lt;a href=\"Governor%20Fortunata%20ap%20Dugal\"&gt;Governor Fortunata ap Dugal&lt;/a&gt; had contracted the Dark Brotherhood to assassinate &lt;a href=\"Commander%20Marcus%20Scipio\"&gt;Commander Marcus Scipio&lt;/a&gt; of the Kvatch guard to which the Brotherhood agreed to. Their talented &lt;a href=\"Vestige\"&gt;recruit&lt;/a&gt; was sent to &lt;a href=\"Castle%20Kvatch%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Castle Kvatch&lt;/a&gt; to kill Scipio. After murdering Scipio, the recruit encountered &lt;a href=\"Count%20Carolus%20Aquilarios\"&gt;Count Carolus Aquilarios&lt;/a&gt; in his chamber who himself had contracted the Dark Brotherhood to assassinate Dugal in return. &lt;a href=\"Speaker%20Terenus%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Speaker Terenus&lt;/a&gt; of the Brotherhood gave the contract to the recruit, and they returned to Anvil. Upon arriving at Anvil Castle, the assassin was greeted by Dugal, and they both shared a drink on the castle balcony. Unfortunately for Dugal, the wine was poisoned, and she collapsed over the balcony edging falling to her doom.\nThe Order vs the Brotherhood; The Primate's Folly.\nThe Dark Brotherhood accepted a contract from Fortunata ap Dugal herself to assassinate &lt;a href=\"Marcus%20Scipio\"&gt;Marcus Scipio&lt;/a&gt;, the leader of the Order. The Brotherhood infiltrated &lt;a href=\"Castle%20Kvatch\"&gt;Castle Kvatch&lt;/a&gt; and killed Scipio, but as they were leaving, Count Aquilarios performed the &lt;a href=\"Black%20Sacrament\"&gt;Black Sacrament&lt;/a&gt;. This got the attention of &lt;a href=\"Speaker%20Terenus\"&gt;Speaker Terenus&lt;/a&gt; and eventually lead to the death of Fortunata ap Dugal, who was poisoned and fell from her balcony. This pair of murders produced an alliance between the Brotherhood and Carolus of Kvatch. The Black Dragon continued to kill Brotherhood assassins, as the Brotherhood thwarted members of the Order and Carolus provided information for the Brotherhood on the Order and the Dragon. When the Black Dragon died, the Dark Brotherhood decided to end the Order's war against them by assassinating Primate Artorius inside of the Cathedral of Akatosh. After delving through the Kvatch Catacombs, the Dark Brotherhood ultimately killed Ponticus, ending the Order's reign over the Gold Coast. From then on Carolus continued to rule over Kvatch and most of the Gold Coast.\n&lt;a href=\"Third%20Era\"&gt;Third Era&lt;/a&gt;.\nCamoran Uprising and Opportunistic Piracy.\nIn &lt;a href=\"3E%20246\"&gt;3E 246&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Haymon%20Camoran\"&gt;Haymon Camoran&lt;/a&gt; invaded Western Tamriel under the name of the Camoran Usurper. The Usurper's army started from &lt;a href=\"Arenthia\"&gt;Arenthia&lt;/a&gt; and moved north along the &lt;a href=\"Abecean%20Coast\"&gt;Abecean Coast&lt;/a&gt; to the &lt;a href=\"Iliac%20Bay\"&gt;Iliac Bay&lt;/a&gt;. Before the Usurper reached the province of &lt;a href=\"Hammerfell\"&gt;Hammerfell&lt;/a&gt;, he had sacked Kvatch. This paved the way for the &lt;a href=\"Battle%20of%20Dragontooth\"&gt;Battle of Dragontooth&lt;/a&gt; and the fall of the twin cities of &lt;a href=\"Rihad\"&gt;Rihad&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Taneth\"&gt;Taneth&lt;/a&gt;. With the Usurper occupying the attention of the &lt;a href=\"Imperial%20Navy\"&gt;Imperial Navy&lt;/a&gt;, the Pirates of the Abecean Sea took advantage of the distraction to attack lands along the coast resulting in a tenfold increase in pirate activity in Anvil. During this period, the pirate &lt;a href=\"Torradan%20ap%20Dugal\"&gt;Torradan ap Dugal&lt;/a&gt; rose to prominence as the captain of the &lt;a href=\"Red%20Sabre\"&gt;Red Sabre&lt;/a&gt;s. With the Navy in need of supplies in &lt;a href=\"High%20Rock\"&gt;High Rock&lt;/a&gt;, Torradan would intercept these ships en route and build a vast armada from Valenwood to Hammerfell.\nThe Uprising came to an end in &lt;a href=\"3E%20267\"&gt;3E 267&lt;/a&gt; when Haymon died at the &lt;a href=\"Battle%20of%20Firewaves\"&gt;Battle of Firewaves&lt;/a&gt; in the Iliac Bay. &lt;a href=\"Fasil%20Umbranox\"&gt;Fasil Umbranox&lt;/a&gt;, Imperial Commodore of the Imperial Navy, set his focus on Torradan and landed in the harbor of Anvil. After a grueling battle, Anvil was captured by Fasil Umbranox, who then began a hunt for Torradan's ship, the &lt;a href=\"Black%20Flag\"&gt;Black Flag&lt;/a&gt;. Torradan evaded him and returned to Anvil, but his ship was attacked by warriors waiting on the port. In the end, only Torradan's Black Flag and Fasil's ship remained. As Torradan attempted to escape, the commodore's mages trapped his ship under an avalanche, where he was stuck in &lt;a href=\"Smuggler%27s%20Cave\"&gt;Smuggler's Cave&lt;/a&gt;. Torradan died after twenty years of being trapped in the cave and his ship has remained underneath Castle Anvil since. For his valor, Fasil Umbranox became the Count of Anvil and his lineage has ruled Anvil ever since.\nThe Counts of the Coast.\nIn &lt;a href=\"3E%20423\"&gt;3E 423&lt;/a&gt;, the Count of Anvil, &lt;a href=\"Corvus%20Umbranox\"&gt;Corvus Umbranox&lt;/a&gt;, was named the Guildmaster of the &lt;a href=\"Thieves%20Guild\"&gt;Thieves Guild&lt;/a&gt; by donning the &lt;a href=\"Gray%20Cowl%20of%20Nocturnal\"&gt;Gray Cowl of Nocturnal&lt;/a&gt; which has been passed down from each Cyrodilic Guildmaster since the original, &lt;a href=\"Emer%20Dareloth\"&gt;Emer Dareloth&lt;/a&gt;. When Corvus donned the cowl, he took upon Nocturnal's curse: whoever wore it would be removed from history. With Corvus was presumed gone, Countess Millona Umbranox assumed the role of leader of Anvil and ruled for ten years into the &lt;a href=\"Fourth%20Era\"&gt;Fourth Era&lt;/a&gt;. At approximately the same time, the Count of Kvatch, &lt;a href=\"Ormellius%20Goldwine\"&gt;Ormellius Goldwine&lt;/a&gt;, had other problems. His sons both strove to inherit the title of Count from their father until they both had lost their lives due to the family strife. Stricken with grief, Count Goldwine continued his reign over Kvatch, all the while mourning the loss of his sons and knowing that a new heir needed to be chosen. In the Imperial City, Uriel Septim VII would pass his throne to his eldest son, &lt;a href=\"Geldall%20Septim\"&gt;Geldall Septim&lt;/a&gt;, Crown Prince of the Empire.\nThe Battle of Kvatch and the Oblivion Crisis.\nIn &lt;a href=\"3E%20433\"&gt;3E 433&lt;/a&gt;, after the murder of all of his sons, Emperor Uriel Septim VII was killed by assassins of the &lt;a href=\"Mythic%20Dawn\"&gt;Mythic Dawn&lt;/a&gt;. With no other heir, the &lt;a href=\"Dragonfires\"&gt;Dragonfires&lt;/a&gt; were unlit and the barrier between &lt;a href=\"Nirn\"&gt;Nirn&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Oblivion\"&gt;Oblivion&lt;/a&gt; was breached. &lt;a href=\"Mehrunes%20Dagon\"&gt;Mehrunes Dagon&lt;/a&gt; and his Oblivion Horde invaded the continent of Tamriel in what became known as the &lt;a href=\"Oblivion%20Crisis\"&gt;Oblivion Crisis&lt;/a&gt;. All throughout the continent, &lt;a href=\"Oblivion%20Gate\"&gt;Oblivion Gate&lt;/a&gt;s opened, leading to the fall of notable locations such as &lt;a href=\"Ald%27ruhn\"&gt;Ald'ruhn&lt;/a&gt; in Morrowind and the &lt;a href=\"Crystal%20Tower\"&gt;Crystal Tower&lt;/a&gt; in the Summerset Isles. The biggest driving point in the Crisis was the &lt;a href=\"Battle%20of%20Kvatch\"&gt;Battle of Kvatch&lt;/a&gt;. An Oblivion Gate had opened in front of the city gates and the horde had swarmed into the city and caused the chapel to collapse onto the main street.\nCount Goldwine and the Kvatch Guard at the castle were killed and the entire hall was set ablaze. &lt;a href=\"Brother%20Martin\"&gt;Brother Martin&lt;/a&gt;, a priest of Akatosh, was able to keep a group of people inside the chapel safe from the daedra. &lt;a href=\"Saint%20Jiub\"&gt;Saint Jiub&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"Vvardenfell\"&gt;Vvardenfell&lt;/a&gt; was killed during this attack. &lt;a href=\"Savlian%20Matius\"&gt;Savlian Matius&lt;/a&gt;, Captain of the City Guard, held the daedra back from the outer gate and guarded the refugee camp. When all hope seemed lost, the &lt;a href=\"Hero%20of%20Kvatch\"&gt;Hero of Kvatch&lt;/a&gt; came and closed the Oblivion Gate. With the help of the city guard and rangers of the &lt;a href=\"Imperial%20Legion\"&gt;Imperial Legion&lt;/a&gt;, the daedric horde was defeated and Kvatch was freed but in ruins. The remaining guard and Savlian took refuge in the Castle.\nUmaril and the Divine Crusader.\nTragedy struck Anvil when the &lt;a href=\"Chapel%20of%20Dibella\"&gt;Chapel of Dibella&lt;/a&gt; was desecrated by an unknown group. Evidence indicated the return of &lt;a href=\"Umaril%20the%20Unfeathered\"&gt;Umaril the Unfeathered&lt;/a&gt; who was the Sorcerer-King of the Ayleids before the &lt;a href=\"Alessian%20Slave%20Rebellion\"&gt;Alessian Slave Rebellion&lt;/a&gt; and his death at the hands of &lt;a href=\"Pelinal%20Whitestrake\"&gt;Pelinal Whitestrake&lt;/a&gt;. Whitestrake had killed Umaril at the Imperial City, but Umaril's allegiance with &lt;a href=\"Meridia\"&gt;Meridia&lt;/a&gt; granted him immortality. When he was killed, his spirit left for &lt;a href=\"Aetherius\"&gt;Aetherius&lt;/a&gt; and waited for a time in which he could return and seek vengeance on the &lt;a href=\"Divines\"&gt;Divines&lt;/a&gt;. After word of the desecration had spread, the Hero gathered the relics of the &lt;a href=\"Divine%20Crusader\"&gt;Divine Crusader&lt;/a&gt; in order to reconstitute the &lt;a href=\"Knights%20of%20the%20Nine%20%28Faction%29\"&gt;Knights of the Nine&lt;/a&gt;. With everything ready, the Knights of the Nine gathered their forces at Umaril's stronghold, the ruined city of &lt;a href=\"Garlas%20Malatar\"&gt;Garlas Malatar&lt;/a&gt;. The Knights battled through waves of &lt;a href=\"Auroran\"&gt;Auroran&lt;/a&gt;s and the Hero as the Divine Crusader confronted Umaril in a duel to the death. Again Umaril's physical body was destroyed and his spiritual body remained. Unlike Whitestrake, the Hero possessed the &lt;a href=\"Blessing%20of%20Talos%20%28Knights%20of%20the%20Nine%29\"&gt;Blessing of Talos&lt;/a&gt;, which enabled them to follow Umaril into the daedric plane and to the skies above the Imperial City, where Umaril was finally and completely defeated. Following this, the Knights of the Nine continued their sworn duty of serving the Nine Divines.\n&lt;a href=\"Fourth%20Era\"&gt;Fourth Era&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe Westward Front &amp; the Cyrodiil Campaign.\nOn the 30th of &lt;a href=\"Frostfall\"&gt;Frostfall&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"4E%20171\"&gt;4E 171&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"Third%20Aldmeri%20Dominion\"&gt;Third Aldmeri Dominion&lt;/a&gt; waged war with the &lt;a href=\"Third%20Empire\"&gt;Third Empire&lt;/a&gt; of Cyrodiil, during the reign of &lt;a href=\"Titus%20Mede%20II\"&gt;Titus Mede II&lt;/a&gt;. The westward campaign of the Dominion was under the control of &lt;a href=\"Lady%20Arannelya\"&gt;Lady Arannelya&lt;/a&gt;, who moved from Valenwood, through the Gold Coast and eventually to the province of Hammerfell. Initially, the Dominion sought to claim the southern regions of Hammerfell, but because of &lt;a href=\"Lord%20Naarifin\"&gt;Lord Naarifin&lt;/a&gt;'s success on the eastward front in the &lt;a href=\"Nibenay\"&gt;Nibenay&lt;/a&gt;, the Dominion set their sights on the Imperial City. The conflict in Cyrodiil began with the destruction of both Anvil and &lt;a href=\"Bravil\"&gt;Bravil&lt;/a&gt; by, and by the end of the year, Lord Naarifin's army was on the outer walls of the Imperial City. The Dominion's reign over the Imperial City lasted for a couple years until Titus Mede II himself, wielding &lt;a href=\"Goldbrand\"&gt;Goldbrand&lt;/a&gt;, retook the city at the &lt;a href=\"Battle%20of%20the%20Red%20Ring\"&gt;Battle of the Red Ring&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"4E%20175\"&gt;4E 175&lt;/a&gt;. The province of Cyrodiil was saved from the onslaught of the Dominion, but to prevent further war, the Empire and the &lt;a href=\"Thalmor\"&gt;Thalmor&lt;/a&gt; created the &lt;a href=\"White-Gold%20Concordat\"&gt;White-Gold Concordat&lt;/a&gt;, a controversial treaty that shifted the tides of Tamriel for many years. Anvil was rebuilt during the following peace."}

Side quests are non-sequential and can be completed in any order, except where one carries on from another, and &lt;a href=\"repeatable%20quests\"&gt;repeatable quests&lt;/a&gt; can be completed multiple times: weekly for arenas and trials and daily for all others.\nItem Sets.\nItem sets are related armor and weapons that, when worn together, provide unique benefits. Overland sets can be acquired from world bosses, world events, delves, public dungeons and containers and as quest rewards; dungeon sets can be acquired from within group dungeons; monster sets can be acquired from the final boss of veteran group dungeons and Undaunted Enclaves; and crafted sets can be created at specific locations across the zone.\nSkyshards.\nSix Skyshards can be found in the Gold Coast totaling in two &lt;a href=\"skill%20points\"&gt;skill points&lt;/a&gt;.

Skyshards will appear on the map and compass when the Vestige is close to one and will remain discovered on the map even if it was not collected.\nAchievements.\nAchievements can be earned by completing specific tasks such as completing quests and discovering locations. Achievements are separated into categories and their progress is viewable from the journal. Earning achievement provides the Vestige a number of points, and some achievements unlock unique rewards such as &lt;a href=\"Furnishings%20%28Online%29\"&gt;furnishings&lt;/a&gt; that can be bought from Achievement Furnishers or &lt;a href=\"collectibles\"&gt;collectibles&lt;/a&gt;.\nShalidor's Library.\nEight books that are a part of Shalidor's Library can be found in the Gold Coast and added to the collection.

This tract discusses the &lt;a href=\"Goblin%20%28Online%29\"&gt;goblin&lt;/a&gt; tribes of the &lt;a href=\"Gold%20Coast%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Gold Coast&lt;/a&gt;, and is presented by the Anvil Fighters Guild.\nHall Steward &lt;a href=\"Shabeh%20af-Naifa\"&gt;Shabeh af-Naifa&lt;/a&gt;,\nPer the terms of my punishment detail, I elected to provide you with this essay regarding the goblin tribes found in the Gold Coast. By your estimate it should have taken me little more than a day's work. It is with great frustration that I deliver this to you a week late.\nThe Sharp Stick tribe claims the southern portion of the Gold Coast as their territory, while the Long Tooth tribe claims the northern. What more is there to say about goblins in the Gold Coast?\nMuch, I discovered, and most of it confusing.\nI first thought the Long Tooth tribe was the oldest goblin tribe in the region, but they are actually a recent arrival. They used to be three tribes: the Long Claws, Tooth Rocks, and Rock Sticks. The Long Claws and Tooth Rocks once fought constantly over hunting grounds southwest of &lt;a href=\"Chorrol%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Chorrol&lt;/a&gt;. Shortly after the Chorrol Fighters Guild took a contract to drive them from the area, they both fled.\nThe tribes harassed each other during their migration to the Gold Coast until they stumbled across the mostly insular but populous Rock Sticks. Presented with a common enemy, Long Claw and Tooth Rocks banded together to slay every Rock Stick who opposed them.\nWithin the month, the remaining goblins began to call themselves Long Tooth tribe. They erected crude banners, effectively claiming the lands north of &lt;a href=\"Anvil%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Anvil&lt;/a&gt; as their territory. I don't know why. The Long Tooth aren't exactly talking.\nAs for the Sharp Stick tribe, they are a mishmash of several former goblin tribes. The Eye Sticks fought the Sharp Rocks, who tricked the Shatter Bones into attacking the Blood Skulls. However, the mortal enemies of the Blood Skulls were the Gut Blades, who ambushed Shatter Bones and Blood Skull alike.\nWhen the Sharp Rocks and Eye Sticks saw the three-sided battle among rival tribes, they briefly allied to conquer the others. On the eve of their victory, Eye Sticks and Sharp Rocks turned on one another. This great battle took place in the southern region of the Gold Coast, to the complete ignorance of all but a hapless &lt;a href=\"Khajiit%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Khajiit&lt;/a&gt; trapper who happened upon them. (He is credited with the popular &lt;a href=\"Kvatch%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Kvatch&lt;/a&gt; tavern song, \"The War That Never Was.\")\nThere were survivors among the five warring tribes. Some fled and became the Rock Sticks who were (years later) subjugated by the Long Claws and Tooth Rocks. Those who remained became the Sharp Sticks, fortifying themselves against reprisal attacks from the Rock Sticks which never came. They eventually turned to a life of farming and kept to themselves.\nWith the Long Tooth and Sharp Stick so close to each other, it is only a matter of time before they clash. If we end up with one big goblin tribe called the Long Sticks, my only request is you put me on the contract to drive them out of the Gold Coast.\n\u2014[Name withheld from wider publication per punishment detail agreement]"}

While caution is always warranted whenever traveling abroad, the visionary polices and leadership of Emperor &lt;a href=\"Leovic\"&gt;Leovic&lt;/a&gt; have dramatically increased safety across our shores. The Emperor himself often vacations with us, and there is no better time than now to take that trip you've always desired to the temperate Gold Coast.\nWith bright sun and clear waves, the Gold Coast enjoys a pleasant climate fueled by warmer currents from the &lt;a href=\"Abecean%20Sea\"&gt;Abecean Sea&lt;/a&gt;. We offer a verdant paradise perfect for a hearty sort looking for true adventure on a reasonable budget. The &lt;a href=\"Imperial%20Navy\"&gt;Imperial Navy&lt;/a&gt;, tasked by our great Emperor with patrolling the Abecean Sea and ensuring safety and security across the region, makes its home port in Anvil, and no pirate dares challenge our Emperor's might. His capable, well-armed navy and accomplished soldiers ensure your safety.\nThis guide will familiarize you with the Gold Coast's history and its many wonderful travel destinations.\nA Fertile Land Bound by Two Great Rivers\nTwo rivers of significant size border the Gold Coast. To the north, the &lt;a href=\"Brena%20River\"&gt;Brena River&lt;/a&gt; separates &lt;a href=\"Cyrodiil\"&gt;Cyrodiil&lt;/a&gt; from &lt;a href=\"Hammerfell\"&gt;Hammerfell&lt;/a&gt;, and to the south, the &lt;a href=\"Strid%20River\"&gt;Strid River&lt;/a&gt; marks the border with &lt;a href=\"Valenwood\"&gt;Valenwood&lt;/a&gt;. Both rivers are crucial trade routes to the interior of the continent. In years past, numerous pirate clans laid claim to both rivers, but the presence of the Imperial Navy has put an end to such activities.\nTo truly appreciate the scale of our great rivers, one must witness the bustle of good-laden galleons sailing up and down the Brena and the Strid at the peak of trade season. While we welcome you to sail our rivers in summer, we advise against winter visits. In those months, humidity and fog make the rivers most unpleasant.\nThe Beauty and Mystery of the Western Uplands\nMuch of the Gold Coast interior consists of rocky highlands and low mountains dotted with trees, including dense oak, beech, and ash forests in the foothills. These areas make for perfect hiking tours or guided expeditions to our many ancient ruins, which are of particular interest to scholars and historians. As much of &lt;a href=\"Colovia\"&gt;Colovia&lt;/a&gt;'s wealth comes from logging, our lumber magnates maintain operations across the Gold Coast. Colovian wood remains in great demand for construction and weaponry.\nOur highlands are also prone to heavy seasonal fog, which has sparked a number of superstitions, including tales of \"&lt;a href=\"Minotaur\"&gt;bull men&lt;/a&gt;\" stalking our ruins! While these are merely rumors spread by bandits inhabiting the highlands, we do suggest you carry weapons or travel with an armed escort. In the Gold Coast, your safety is our paramount concern, and we work hard to make your stay as pleasant and enjoyable as possible."}

The inhabitants of Kvatch enjoy a reputation for being well-read and pleasant, as well as conservative and pious. For those devout travelers who wish to commune with or learn more about the &lt;a href=\"Nine%20Divines\"&gt;Divines&lt;/a&gt;, the priests of Kvatch welcome pilgrims for devotions and worship with open arms.\nThe legendary &lt;a href=\"Kvatch%20%28Online%29%23Great%20Cathedral%20of%20Akatosh\"&gt;Great Cathedral of Akatosh&lt;/a&gt; dominates Kvatch's skyline, with an awe-inspiring profile and elegant interior. With shrines to each of the Divines, the Cathedral draws visitors from far and wide to gaze upon its majesty and beauty. The venerable &lt;a href=\"Order%20of%20the%20Hour%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Order of the Hour&lt;/a&gt;, protectors of the Primate of &lt;a href=\"Akatosh\"&gt;Akatosh&lt;/a&gt; and the Cathedral, can often be seen going about their duties in and around the Cathedral. They supplement the efforts of the &lt;a href=\"Kvatch%20Warders\"&gt;Kvatch Warders&lt;/a&gt;, who have kept watch over the city for generations. Between the two groups, Kvatch remains one of the safest places in all of the &lt;a href=\"Reman%20Empire\"&gt;Empire&lt;/a&gt;.\nBut don't think Kvatch serves only as a destination for worship and reflection. It also hosts one of the oldest fighting pits in &lt;a href=\"Tamriel\"&gt;Tamriel&lt;/a&gt; - the legendary &lt;a href=\"Kvatch%20Arena%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Kvatch Arena&lt;/a&gt;. While no arena can rival the one in &lt;a href=\"Imperial%20City%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Imperial City&lt;/a&gt;, many of that arena's best fighters got their start right here on the Gold Coast. Enjoying a match at the Kvatch Arena provides a great opportunity to see novice fighters before they earn a place in Imperial City.\nThe Cosmopolitan Paradise of &lt;a href=\"Anvil%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Anvil&lt;/a&gt;\nThe port of call when journeying to the Gold Coast, Anvil is the crown jewel of the &lt;a href=\"Abecean%20Sea%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Abecean Sea&lt;/a&gt;!\nAs the Gold Coast's finest port city, Anvil hosts retreats for royalty and dignitaries from across Cyrodiil and beyond. The wise and noble &lt;a href=\"Count%20Ephrem%20Benirus\"&gt;Count Ephrem Benirus&lt;/a&gt; bears the title of Imperial Prefect and governs this fine city at the pleasure of the &lt;a href=\"Emperor\"&gt;Emperor&lt;/a&gt;, who often visits during the summer months. A lucky visitor may witness out great &lt;a href=\"Emperor%20Leovic\"&gt;Emperor Leovic&lt;/a&gt; waving to his loyal subjects from the balcony of &lt;a href=\"Anvil%20%28Online%29%23Anvil%20Castle\"&gt;Anvil Castle&lt;/a&gt;.\nTravelers from all over come to take advantage of the wonderful open air markets, filled with curiosities and delicacies from across Tamriel. Others come to dine at the many fine eateries. Still others frolic on the sandy beaches and swim the clear waters of the Abecean Sea. While the city has many luxurious accommodations for noble families and those of means, some of the citizenry also cater to visitors with a smaller purse, offering guest rooms in their own cozy, beach-front cottages.\nUltimately, there is no more desirable travel destination than the temperate and beautiful Gold Coast. Whether you come on a pilgrimage to the Great Cathedral of Akatosh, stay to enjoy the exciting fights at the Kvatch Arena, delve into our ancient ruins, or take in the metropolitan splendor of Anvil, you will find the luxuries and adventures you seek on the edge of the Abecean Sea. Come soon. We look forward to seeing you!"}

Now, what doesn't mean we have to kill these people. We might have to work with them, or request a favor, or - no, we'll probably have to kill them. That's usually what we do.\n&lt;a href=\"Provincial%20Governor%20Fortunata%20ap%20Dugal\"&gt;Provincial Governor Fortunata ap Dugal&lt;/a&gt;: The one-time Pirate Queen started out as a minor functionary in the &lt;a href=\"Gold%20Coast%20Trading%20Company%20%28Faction%29\"&gt;Gold Coast Trading Company&lt;/a&gt; before her skills and ambitions earned her a place among the merchant lords at the top of the organization. But that wasn't enough for Fortunata. She set sail for an extended trade mission. When she returned, she was at the head of an armada or pirate vessels as the wildly popular queen of the &lt;a href=\"Red%20Sails\"&gt;Red Sails&lt;/a&gt; pirates. She seized the control of &lt;a href=\"Anvil%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Anvil&lt;/a&gt; and proclaimed herself the Provincial Governor of the city. Now Fortunata rules Anvil with an iron fist wrapped in a velvet glove. No one dares challenge her due to her own strong personality and demonstrated fighting skills, and because there are always at least a dozen heavily armed pirates at her beck and call. Not to mention her personal &lt;a href=\"Rat%20Master\"&gt;Rat Master&lt;/a&gt;, who brings her secrets like a lover brings gifts. Her ambitions exceed the borders of the port city, however, and she has already declared that the entire Gold Coast is under her control. That's not quite true, but it appears that it soon will be.\n&lt;a href=\"Count%20Carolus%20Aquilarios\"&gt;Count Carolus Aquilarios&lt;/a&gt;: The Wolf of &lt;a href=\"Kvatch%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Kvatch&lt;/a&gt; is the nephew of &lt;a href=\"Varen%20Aquilarios%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Varen Aquilarios&lt;/a&gt;. He's served his city and defended it ever since Varen marched off to war. He may be the only truly good person among the movers and shakers of the Gold Coast. He's a man of faith and conviction, honorable and proud of his heritage. I also find him to be extremely dull. He doesn't like Fortunata, though, and has so far been able to keep her pirates out of Kvatch. He has an uneasy alliance with the &lt;a href=\"Cathedral%20of%20Akatosh\"&gt;Cathedral of Akatosh&lt;/a&gt;, which dominates not only his city's skyline but serves as its spiritual conscience as well. In fact, he recently granted the Cathedral's protectors, the &lt;a href=\"Order%20of%20the%20Hour%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Order of the Hour&lt;/a&gt;, expanded rights and duties to supplement the efforts of the Kvatch Guard. He could prove to be a powerful opponent of the &lt;a href=\"Dark%20Brotherhood%20%28Online%20Faction%29\"&gt;Brotherhood&lt;/a&gt; - if he weren't mired in the politics of just keeping his city safe from those who would like to carve it up like a festival goose.\n&lt;a href=\"Primate%20Artorius%20Ponticus\"&gt;Primate Artorius Ponticus&lt;/a&gt;: The head of the &lt;a href=\"Akatosh\"&gt;Akatosh&lt;/a&gt; faith and the leader of the Great Cathedral, presents an interesting and complicated man. He practically burns with religious fervor and truly believes that Akatosh guides and supports his efforts. He's also as ambitious in his own way as Fortunata, as demonstrated by his swift rise though the religious hierarchy. For a religious man, he has a surprisingly vast network of spies and informants hidden throughout the Gold Coast. It's exceedingly rare for something to happen that the Primate doesn't know about. He is supported by the &lt;a href=\"Grand%20Chanter%20Surus\"&gt;Grand Chanter Surus&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Grand%20Sermonizer%20Fithia\"&gt;Grand Sermonizer Fithia&lt;/a&gt;, as well as the warrior-priests of the Order of the Hour. If Artorius were ever to turn his faithful followers against us, they might be powerful enough to threaten the Brotherhood. Not that I think that scenario is likely.\nOther notable include &lt;a href=\"Lord%20Quintus%20Jarol\"&gt;Lord Quintus Jarol&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Commander%20Marcus%20Scipio\"&gt;Commander Marcus Scipio&lt;/a&gt; of the Order of the Hour, &lt;a href=\"Lord%20Harthaw%20Brent\"&gt;Lord Harthaw Brent&lt;/a&gt; of the Gold Coast Trading Company, and a visitor to our lands who thought to go unnoticed, &lt;a href=\"Razum-dar%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Razum-dar&lt;/a&gt; of the &lt;a href=\"Eyes%20of%20the%20Queen\"&gt;Queen's Eyes&lt;/a&gt;. Reports of these potential threats, targets, or allies will be on your desk shortly."}

It is the only set of armor other than the &lt;a href=\"Dragon%20Priest%20Masks%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;dragon priest masks&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Nightingale%20Armor\"&gt;Nightingale Armor&lt;/a&gt; to feature a cowl with actual protective leather. The cowl has two variations: one with the face cover, and one without. Each piece is also enchanted.

One is called &lt;a href=\"ancient%20shrouded%20armor\"&gt;ancient shrouded armor&lt;/a&gt;. It looks exactly the same as the shrouded armor but provides improved enchantments and armor ratings. The other is the &lt;a href=\"worn%20shrouded%20armor\"&gt;worn shrouded armor&lt;/a&gt;, which doesn't have any previous enchantments, thus potentially making it the most valuable, especially if one acquired the &lt;a href=\"Extra%20Effect\"&gt;Extra Effect&lt;/a&gt; perk, since it can be greatly \"customized.\" &lt;a href=\"Tumblerbane%20Gloves\"&gt;Tumblerbane Gloves&lt;/a&gt;, a unique variant of &lt;a href=\"shrouded%20gloves\"&gt;shrouded gloves&lt;/a&gt;, are also found in the &lt;a href=\"Dawnstar%20Sanctuary\"&gt;Dawnstar Sanctuary&lt;/a&gt; after purchasing the bedroom part of the sanctuary during \"&lt;a href=\"Where%20You%20Hang%20Your%20Enemy%27s%20Head\"&gt;Where You Hang Your Enemy's Head&lt;/a&gt;.\"\nAcquisition.\nJoining the Dark Brotherhood.\nJoining the Dark Brotherhood automatically allows the armor to be collected; &lt;a href=\"Astrid%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Astrid&lt;/a&gt; provides it after arriving at the Dark Brotherhood Sanctuary for the first time.\nKilling Dark Brotherhood members.\nAlternatively, it can be obtained without joining the Dark Brotherhood by killing Astrid during the &lt;a href=\"Quests%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;quest&lt;/a&gt; \"&lt;a href=\"With%20Friends%20Like%20These...\"&gt;With Friends Like These...&lt;/a&gt;,\" or looted, albeit without the cowl, from the corpses of various Dark Brotherhood members during \"&lt;a href=\"Destroy%20the%20Dark%20Brotherhood%21\"&gt;Destroy the Dark Brotherhood!&lt;/a&gt;\"\nAdditional sets.\nA few additional sets of this armor may be obtained by having the &lt;a href=\"Perfect%20Touch\"&gt;Perfect Touch&lt;/a&gt;, a perk of the &lt;a href=\"Pickpocket\"&gt;Pickpocket&lt;/a&gt; skill tree. In the quest \"&lt;a href=\"The%20Cure%20for%20Madness\"&gt;The Cure for Madness&lt;/a&gt;,\" another Dark Brotherhood sanctuary near &lt;a href=\"Dawnstar%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Dawnstar&lt;/a&gt; is visited. The ghosts which roam the sanctuary wear this armor. Killing them causes their corpses to disappear, not allowing the collection of the armor. However, these apparitions can be pickpocketed for the armor pieces with this perk. When the quest \"Where You Hang Your Enemy's Head\" is completed, an additional set of armor (minus the cuirass) can be found on the Mannequin in the Master Bedroom."}

If I shut the mines down, I will have won Garisa Llethri's support.\"\nWalkthrough.\nHaving found the &lt;a href=\"Secret%20Caldera%20Ledger\"&gt;Secret Caldera Ledger&lt;/a&gt;, and revealed to &lt;a href=\"Garisa%20Llethri\"&gt;Garisa Llethri&lt;/a&gt; the &lt;a href=\"Evidence%20of%20Corruption\"&gt;Evidence of Corruption&lt;/a&gt; by &lt;a href=\"House%20Hlaalu\"&gt;House Hlaalu&lt;/a&gt; at the &lt;a href=\"Caldera%20Mine\"&gt;Caldera Mine&lt;/a&gt;, the Nerevarine is tasked with shutting the Mines down. Llethri does have a vague idea of how to close the Mine; however, he suggests speaking to the people involved at the Mine to find a better solution to the problem.\nClosing the Mine.\nThe people in and around the Mine and the town of &lt;a href=\"Caldera%20%28Morrowind%29\"&gt;Caldera&lt;/a&gt; will reveal that two realistic methods exist to close the Mine down. The first is to cause a revolt among the slaves by freeing their \"de facto\" leader,\u00a0&lt;a href=\"Dahleena\"&gt;Dahleena&lt;/a&gt;. The second option is to kill the Mine's major operators, &lt;a href=\"Odral%20Helvi\"&gt;Odral Helvi&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Stlennius%20Vibato\"&gt;Stlennius Vibato&lt;/a&gt;.\nFree Dahleena.\nShould the Nerevarine choose to release Dahleena, then the issue of freeing her comes to light. The only way to release her is to find the slave key for the Caldera Mine Slaves, which she suggests can be found in the Guard Tower for the Mine. Having got the key, the Nerevarine can remove her slave bracers, thus allowing her to escape. Once she has escaped, the slaves will begin an open revolt against the Mine's controllers.\nKill the Mines Operators.\nThe other option is to kill the Mine's owners, which can prove a tough task for the Nerevarine, particularly if they intend to remove them subtly. Odral Helvi can be found in his room in the &lt;a href=\"Governor%27s%20Hall\"&gt;Caldera Governor's Hall&lt;/a&gt;, while Stlennius Vibato can be found in the Office of the &lt;a href=\"Caldera%20Mining%20Company\"&gt;Caldera Mining Company&lt;/a&gt;. Once they are dead, the Mine will not have a clear leadership structure, causing the Mine, as a company, to collapse.\nOnce either method has been followed, the Nerevarine must return to Llethri to finish the quest. If the Nerevarine chose to free Dahleena then Llethri will grant the Nerevarine a pair of &lt;a href=\"Ebony%20Boots%20%28Morrowind%29\"&gt;Ebony Boots&lt;/a&gt; as a reward."}

However, when asked as to why he did so, Siddgeir says that he took over because his uncle was too old and frail to rule as a Jarl.\nPersonality.\nSiddgeir can be seen as being lazy or unmotivated, as he usually lets his steward,\u00a0&lt;a href=\"Nenya\"&gt;Nenya&lt;/a&gt;, do his work for him.

He may also appear to be condescending, showing a lack of regard towards the Dragonborn when spoken to.\nInteractions.\nIf the city is taken by the\u00a0&lt;a href=\"Stormcloaks\"&gt;Stormcloaks&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Dengeir%20of%20Stuhn\"&gt;Dengeir of Stuhn&lt;/a&gt; takes over again as a Jarl.

They are randomly generated and are not related to the storyline. Thus, are not required to finish the main storyline. They can be started by talking to characters and asking about rumors.\nArtifact quests.\nArtifact quests are the necessary steps to acquire one of the sixteen unique &lt;a href=\"Artifacts%20%28Arena%29\"&gt;artifacts&lt;/a&gt; found throughout &lt;a href=\"Tamriel\"&gt;Tamriel&lt;/a&gt;. Unlike other side quests, these are initially started by asking around for \"general rumors\" as opposed to \"work.\" Certain characters will mention hearing about someone offering the location to an artifact in exchange for gold and pointing the &lt;a href=\"Eternal%20Champion\"&gt;Eternal Champion&lt;/a&gt; to a nearby &lt;a href=\"Inns%20%28Arena%29\"&gt;inn&lt;/a&gt;. Speaking to the bartender will lead to the said person approaching the Champion and sending them on a quest to find a map piece in a chest in a randomly generated 4-level &lt;a href=\"Dungeons%20%28Arena%29\"&gt;dungeon&lt;/a&gt;. After finding the map piece, the Champion will have the actual location of the artifact inscribed on their world map, another 4-level dungeon. After clearing it out, the artifact will be located in a chest on the last floor. Normally, if the Champion possesses one such artifact, they cannot possess another nor complete any more Artifact Quests without using up the items charges, dropping the item, or through exploits.\nItem quests.\nItem quests involve the Champion acquiring an item for another character and returning it to them within a specified time frame. These can be as simple as going to the local &lt;a href=\"Mages%20Guild%20%28Arena%29\"&gt;Mages Guild&lt;/a&gt; or temple, asking for the item, and returning to the quest giver\u2014or as difficult as transversing a nearby dungeon, fighting through creatures, and having to search for the item in question.\nEscort quests.\nEscort quests involve escorting a character to a location. Again, these can be as simple as walking from one side of the town to the other, or traveling to an entirely different city within the province. \nRescue quests.\nRescue quests are given by royalty who will ask the Champion to rescue someone, typically a family member, from a nearby dungeon. The Champion will find said captive guarded by a creature, which will announce its presence when nearby. Selecting the character will \"add\" them to the Champions inventory, and they can now leave the dungeon and return to the quest giver for their reward.\nFugitive quests.\nFugitive quests involve capturing an outlaw who has fled the King or Queen's justice, retreating to a dungeon of the same name. The fugitive will appear as a human enemy and attack the Champion. When they are defeated, they will appear in their inventory, much like an escort quest or rescue quest. The criminal typically shares their dungeon with a random monster (ranging from a &lt;a href=\"Minotaur%20%28Arena%29\"&gt;minotaur&lt;/a&gt; to &lt;a href=\"Lich%20%28Arena%29\"&gt;lich&lt;/a&gt;, regardless of level)."}

She crushed the Ayleid city with her stone roots and buried the grotto almost entirely.\nSublocations.\nSideways Cave.\nThe entrance of this cave leads to an area where the Hero cannot make the jump across the chasm. There is a rocky slope that acts as a stairway down to the lower area. This leads around to the other side of the chasm. In the process of following the tunnels the Hero will come upon a &lt;a href=\"Dead%20Treasure%20Hunter\"&gt;Dead Treasure Hunter&lt;/a&gt; lying on a slab. Further ahead is found a chest surrounded by a bunch of skeletons; taking the time to move the bodies of these using the pickup function will reveal a few items and gold underneath them.\nTraps.\nThere are two cave-in traps located just through the tunnel after climbing down to the lower area. The tunnel itself holds the first one, and a left after making it through the tunnel reveals another one that completely blocks the path. Shaking notifies the Hero of a cave-in, giving them time to avoid any damage.\nSideways Cave - Hidden Lake.\nAn underground hidden lake with the ruins of an ancient &lt;a href=\"Ayleid\"&gt;Ayleid&lt;/a&gt; structure. Following the flooded tunnel, turn left then make a right as the cavern opens up. Look to the left, there will be a ladder half exposed on top of a pile of rocks. It may seem that one can jump up there with a high acrobatics skill, do not go up. Follow the cave and exit out onto that small ledge.\nSideways Cave - Lost Abagarlas.\nAs soon as the Hero enter this portion of the cave there is a skeleton with a tablet near it. This is the third Ayleid tablet leading further into the ruins, which are overrun by a large root system."}

It was added with official &lt;a href=\"Official%20Plug-ins%20%28Morrowind%29\"&gt;plug-in&lt;/a&gt; of the &lt;a href=\"Siege%20at%20Firemoth%20%28Plug-in%29\"&gt;same name&lt;/a&gt;.\nWalkthrough.\nTo start, talk to &lt;a href=\"Sellus%20Gravius\"&gt;Sellus Gravius&lt;/a&gt; at the &lt;a href=\"Census%20and%20Excise%20Office%20%28Morrowind%29\"&gt;Census and Excise Office&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Seyda%20Neen%20%28Morrowind%29\"&gt;Seyda Neen&lt;/a&gt;. Ask him about \"Firemoth,\" and he will set you up with a ship and a crew to sail there and re-take the fort. Then head out to the docks, where you will meet &lt;a href=\"Aronil%20%28Morrowind%29\"&gt;Aronil&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Hjrondir\"&gt;Hjrondir&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Mara%20%28Character%29\"&gt;Mara&lt;/a&gt;. Talk to &lt;a href=\"Silm-Dar\"&gt;Silm-Dar&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"Argonian\"&gt;Argonian&lt;/a&gt; shipmaster there, and he will take you to the island.\nWhen you arrive, you'll find yourself on the northern edge of a circular ring of islands. Go either direction, and you'll soon start running into hordes of skeletons. There are lots of skeletons (half of them archers) on these islands, and more in the Keep, so you'll need to pack a good supply to last through them all. The Keep is on the southern edge of the ring, so either direction you go will work. If you take the western side of the ring, you might find a secret entrance which skips half of the dungeon, but you're also missing out on a lot of good loot, so it's your choice.\nThe Keep itself is relatively straightforward. If you approached from the east, you'll first see two Guard Towers out front. There's very little of value in them, though they do provide a good respite from fighting if you need to rest, as there are no enemies inside. The exterior of the Keep is guarded by many archers on the walls, so you'll want to run in fast to take them down. You could try archery or magic to shoot them from the ground, but there's a lot of them, and they have advantage of high-ground as well as numbers, plus you've got three relatively stupid warriors to protect if they haven't gotten themselves killed already, so the direct approach is most likely to keep everyone alive.\nOnce you've secured the area, you can either enter via the front doors, or through one of the doors in the two towers in front. They both lead to the same general area, but you can avoid most of the enemies via the tower entrances. From the main room here, you can go to the stairs at the back of the hall to reach the Upper Chambers. Inside is a corpse carrying a key which helps to gain access to the lower areas. Or if you want to avoid fighting, enter through the towers and just go down the stairs as low as you can go, avoiding the hallway that leads to the main room. The stairs to the Great Hall are at the bottom.\nThe Great Hall is a very large, open rectangular room with lots of skeletons. There's nothing of real value here, but it's pretty hard to avoid having to fight every single one of them getting to the other side, and the doors to the Guard Quarters.\nNow you're in the Guard Quarters. One thing not to miss is just before the stairs leading to the next section, turn around to your right and examine the wall behind where you came in. You'll find a secret door and a passageway that leads to a room with a bunch of nice treasure in it. The door to the next section, the Dungeon, is locked. It's a 50-point lock, or you can use the key if you got it before from the Upper Chambers.\nOnce you enter the Dungeon, you'll be fighting rats. Lots of them. Not very difficult, except that there's over 30 of them, and all carrying diseases. This room appears straightforward, but instead of going straight through, look at the prison cell to the right of the stairs downward. You'll find a second secret entrance to the next section which gives you access to some more help.\nEither door from the Dungeon will lead to the Mine. If you took the secret door, you'll be in a passage with a lot of Violet Coprinus and Luminous Russula, and at the end, you'll find a reinforcement, a &lt;a href=\"Khajiit%20%28Morrowind%29\"&gt;Khajiit&lt;/a&gt;\u00a0archer named &lt;a href=\"J%27Hanir\"&gt;J'Hanir&lt;/a&gt;. A short drop from this section will lead to the main part of the Mine, which is where you'd have ended up if you took the other door. There are some Raw Ebony rocks here.\nPast the Mine are the Upper Caverns, a pretty much linear path leading down to the next section. There are three skeletons here.\nThe Lower Caverns are next: more ebony, more mushrooms, more skeletons. And you'll notice as soon as you enter the door you would have come in through if you'd taken the secret entrance from the outside of the Fort. This is yet another linear dungeon leading to the final section.\nThe last area of this place is a tomb in the &lt;a href=\"Velothi\"&gt;Velothi&lt;/a&gt; style, swarming with skeletons, and all led by &lt;a href=\"Grurn\"&gt;Grurn&lt;/a&gt;, a powerful lich. His primary attack is an area-effect shock spell, and he regenerates Magicka so fast that he can keep it up forever. His health also regenerates, so you need to kill him quickly or he'll just heal up again. If any of your companions have managed to make it this far, this is where they will almost certainly die. His spell does 100 points of damage over 5 feet. In addition, Grurn has a shield which gives him a constant effect Luck boost, which will make him somewhat hard to hit. Once you kill him, claim the prize, the &lt;a href=\"Ward%20of%20Akavir\"&gt;Ward of Akavir&lt;/a&gt;.\nReturn to &lt;a href=\"Seyda%20Neen%20%28Morrowind%29\"&gt;Seyda Neen&lt;/a&gt;. If you don't like the shield, you can give it to Sellus Gravius for a 3000 gold reward and 2 points of Reputation. Or you could sell it to somebody else for more money \u2014 it's worth 5000. Otherwise, just keep it.\nKeeping all the followers alive.\nIf you intend to keep all three (eventually four) companions alive and have sailed with the first three, this is challenging, and not practical except for high-level characters who can cast spell after spell while shrugging off assaults from multiple archers and your own spellcaster ally. (It's also arguably what makes this quest fun at all for such characters, since the monsters and loot are not leveled \u2013 there aren't even any Skeleton Champions. This quest appears to have been written with level 5\u201310 characters in mind.) Aronil casts &lt;a href=\"Shockball\"&gt;Shockball&lt;/a&gt;, a lot, with no regard for who may be in the way, including you and his two comrades.\u00a0 Mara (who is really rather weak for a mission like this) will often die from this friendly fire in the very first engagement.\u00a0 One strategy is to cast &lt;a href=\"Calm%20Humanoid\"&gt;Calm Humanoid&lt;/a&gt; on her periodically to keep her out of the fight, and to cast &lt;a href=\"Restore%20Health%20%28Morrowind%29\"&gt;Restore Health&lt;/a&gt; on Hjrondir frequently, and leave most of the fighting to him and Aronil. Unlike with &lt;a href=\"Calvus%20Horatius\"&gt;Calvus Horatius&lt;/a&gt;, you cannot access these companions' inventories to give them healing potions or better gear, nor can you order them to wait while you go ahead. Another strategy is to leave Aronil behind with a Calm, and do most of the fighting with the other two.\u00a0 A different approach is to stay in deep water as much as possible and return to it, leading the skeletons into the sea for swimming melee (but note that the companions do not have water-breathing ability, so keep it at the surface, and listen for drowning sounds). If you have the &lt;a href=\"Boots%20of%20Blinding%20Speed\"&gt;Boots of Blinding Speed&lt;/a&gt; or another way to &lt;a href=\"Fortify%20Attribute%20%28Morrowind%29\"&gt;greatly boost your speed&lt;/a&gt;, you can also simply outrun all the companions quickly on land and do most of the fighting yourself.\nWith the companions in tow, you are very likely to need to use the &lt;a href=\"Console%20Commands%20%28Morrowind%29\"&gt;Console command&lt;/a&gt; codice_1 (codice_2) in the Keep one or more times. Imperial architecture is not very follower-friendly, and there are several places where the companions can box you in with no other convenient means to get past them and continue. Other options include teleporting off the island and returning to it, or casting a &lt;a href=\"Demoralize%20Humanoid\"&gt;Demoralize Humanoid&lt;/a&gt; on them to get them to run around for a while and get out of your way. Armed with this forewarning, you can also cast &lt;a href=\"Mark\"&gt;Mark&lt;/a&gt; in an open area in the Keep in case you get stuck this way.\nAs noted above, you are best off in the Grurn fight closing with the lich yourself, leaving the followers to deal with the skeletons, and despatching Grurn as quickly as possible with fast weapons, since he can kill most of your followers in one to two spellcastings.\nIf you manage to keep any or all of your original followers alive and return to the ship with them, they will return with you to the mainland and stay on the ship. J'Hanir is different: If you've picked him up as a follower, he will be one until killed. He cannot, however, take the ship back to the mainland with you. You can return to Firemoth manually across the water (e.g. for more of the piles of heavy &lt;a href=\"Imperial%20Steel%20Armor\"&gt;Imperial Steel Armor&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Raw%20Ebony\"&gt;Raw Ebony&lt;/a&gt; loot here), and then you can bring him home with you the way you came. If you killed Grurn before finding J'Hanir, this NPC will never enter follower mode, and he'll simply stay in his mine cave indefinitely.\nThe ship, along with the captain and any of the surviving original three followers, will disappear from the game after you turn over the Ward of Akavir to Sellus Gravius. J'Hanir does not vanish in this manner. Keeping the shield and not taking the ship home (see bug section) can actually net you all four companions as permanent-until-death followers."}

Dated 2E 365. Describing one of the last nights on the Gathering Storm's siege of Vastyr.\nFire rained down on the ramparts while gale winds did their best to spread the flames from the battlements and onto our rooves last night. We worked through the long dark, pulling buckets of water from the well and passing them hand to waiting hand. The unfortunate buildings whose roofs were but kindling to the fleet of Gathering Storm ships who waged war on us. My own home was spared the indignity of burning as I toiled away many hours to ensure that my thatched roof was sufficiently doused. Still, anytime sparks from the battlements floated toward the street, I spared a moment to pray to the Eight. I prayed they keep my Atoine and the foundling we care for, Nomu-Ta, safe. \nI heard the calls from the guards. How the &lt;a href=\"Sea%20Elves\"&gt;Sea Elves&lt;/a&gt; of the Gathering Storm were spreading their vessels across our shoreline. I felt when their sea mages dropped the wind howling spell and the gales fell quiet. The burning houses roared with renewed vigor but for a moment, the buckets stopped mid pass. All was still. \nThen, with a surprising clash of thunder, one of the guards called out, \"The sea is retreating!\"\nSome abandoned their posts in the line to rush to the ramparts and see this strange behavior. Others let their buckets clatter to the cobblestones and ran toward the locked gates out of Vastyr. \nThe knight in charge of the water line bellowed against the commotion, \"Get back to your stations before we lose this city to the fires!\" Which succeeded in restoring some to their posts, but many more made up their minds to scamper from the main square. The most foolish ran into the darkness of the old &lt;a href=\"druid\"&gt;druid&lt;/a&gt; tunnels. I saw their shadows as they passed me and disappeared into the inky depths of the underground.\nBuckets were righted and filled with water, though now with fewer people, our lines were broken. It took more effort to pass the buckets over the gulf between members and the work seemed fit to tear the skin from my hands. But we persisted and managed to stop the flames from engulfing the stalls of the eastern market.\nFrom up above came screams of terror from civilian and guard alike. A formless, slithering keen that rose in volume and pitch as whatever sparked it did not resolve itself. I looked up as the sound of running feet brought the screams hurdling down from the ramparts. \"Move,\" the flood of bodies cried, \"move or you'll be swallowed by the great wave, too.\" This made no sense to me, as I had no grasp of what would befall us, but the pressing threat of all the panicked people was danger enough. \n\"Great wave. Move. Get to high ground.\" The sound pushed me forward, up steps and over steep inclines. As we ran, the sound of a wave grew louder. It was unmistakable, an elongated roar that seemed taller than possible. I heard and felt the moment the wave crested the ramparts where so many had stood not moments ago. It broke against Vastyr's high wall and crashed over the side in a destructive wall of water. Homes crumbled beneath its weight. Stones broke from their moorings. Even ships in the harbor dashed themselves to ruin against the docks in the dizzying power of its wake.\nI'm not sure about the crowd which ran at my back, but my feet did not stop until I no longer heard the sound of water behind me. Only then, at the top of the highest peak, did I pause, my chest heaving with effort, and turn to face the horrors of what the Gathering Storm summoned. \nOur Vastyr was partially submerged. Detritus floated and sunk in the dark waters. Strangely, my first clear thoughts were not of anger or sadness, just a glum resignation. When the dawn broke, we were going to have to fish bodies out of the old druid tunnels."}

He sent an undead minion to the Emperor with an ultimatum: he would permit everyone to leave the Imperial City unharmed, so long as they gave him the city. Emperor Mede refused and prepared the Imperial Legions for battle. In fact, Mede had been aware of Umbriel before it even attacked Lilmoth. Despite his son Attrebus' demands for action, Mede had refused since Black Marsh and Morrowind were no longer part of the Empire. However, he sent mages escorted by legionnaires to survey the city just in case it turned towards &lt;a href=\"Cyrodiil\"&gt;Cyrodiil&lt;/a&gt;. When it did, the scouts fell back as Umbriel destroyed &lt;a href=\"Cheydinhal%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;Cheydinhal&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe siege.\nSkirmish northeast of the city.\nCommanding the Legion's skirmish was &lt;a href=\"General%20Takar\"&gt;General Takar&lt;/a&gt;, a &lt;a href=\"Redguard\"&gt;Redguard&lt;/a&gt; from &lt;a href=\"Hammerfell\"&gt;Hammerfell&lt;/a&gt;. He led his forces, five thousand soldiers made up almost entirely of cavalry and mages, northeast of the Imperial City to meet Umbriel before it reached the city. With Takar were eight wagons containing unknown engines. As the cavalry charged the undead lines, the mages took to the air with the wagons, flying straight at Umbriel. Within its bubble, Vuhon's flying \"Taskers\" appeared in huge swarms and slaughtered the mages before they could get close. After that General Takar sounded the retreat, and Umbriel proceeded undettered towards White-Gold Tower. The &lt;a href=\"Synod\"&gt;Synod&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"College%20of%20Whispers\"&gt;College of Whispers&lt;/a&gt; made two more attempts to attack Umbriel by air, without success.\nBattle on the shores of Lake Rumare.\nTwo days later, Umbriel arrived at the Imperial City. Several Legion detachments under &lt;a href=\"Commander%20Prossos\"&gt;Commander Prossos&lt;/a&gt; were deployed along the shores of &lt;a href=\"Lake%20Rumare\"&gt;Lake Rumare&lt;/a&gt; to attempt to hold the undead. While the disciplined legionnairies were able to kill several times their own number, the enemy kept on coming in endless waves. A battalion of spearmen was able to repel an attack on the main gates, but the undead turned their assault to the northeastern wall near the Imperial Prison where Umbriel was floating over the walls. There, the Twelfth Legion was pushed back to the walls of the city as countless thousands of undead surged against their shield wall.\nFall of Lord Umbriel.\nInside Umbriel itself, Sul, Attrebus and &lt;a href=\"Mere-Glim\"&gt;Mere-Glim&lt;/a&gt; discovered that Vuhon had stored his soul within the Ingenium itself along with the Umbra entity, and only by stabbing it with the Umbra sword would he be killed. Mere-Glim attempted to use the sentient Hist-like trees in the Fringe Gyre to move Umbriel out of Mundus, but Vuhon sensed his attempt and used his magic to prevent it. The trio managed to reach the Ingenium in the heart of the city, and while Mere-Glim and Sul held off Vuhon, Attrebus drove the Umbra sword into the Ingenium. Vuhon's soul and the Umbra entity were drawn into the blade.\u00a0Attrebus was\u00a0then possessed by Clavicus Vile, who planned on claiming his soul and taking Umbriel back into his realm of Oblivion. However, Sul attacked Vile, who stabbed him with the sword, causing Attrebus to let go and Sul to fall onto the Ingenium. Vile released Attrebus and claimed Sul's soul instead. With Vuhon dead, Mere-Glim was able to use the Hist-like trees to take Umbriel out of Mundus into the realm the trees originated, not Vile's realm.\nAs soon as Umbriel left Mundus, the undead army besiegeing the Imperial City simply fell where they stood.\nOutcome.\nThe Imperial Legion was victorious, which resulted in the end of the Umbriel Crisis. While Attrebus and his companions were responsible for the end of the Crisis and the battle, he decided to give credit to the Synod and the College of Whispers, as the two organizations had worked together for the first time during the Crisis, and he wished for them to be on good terms for the good of the Empire."}

A journal left by Skorm Snow-Strider may reveal a way past the collapsed area.\"\nWalkthrough.\nIn Forelhost's courtyard, Captain Valmir has established a camp. If approached, he starts a conversation with the Dragonborn and asks for help with retrieving a mask from inside the tomb. The mask in question is the &lt;a href=\"Dragon%20Priest%20Masks%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;dragon priest mask&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Rahgot%20%28Mask%29\"&gt;Rahgot&lt;/a&gt;. He also asks to possibly find \"&lt;a href=\"Skorm%20Snow-Strider%27s%20Journal\"&gt;Skorm Snow-Strider's journal&lt;/a&gt;\" (optional). The quest starts by following him to the entrance. (If the Dragonborn has a bounty, Captain Valmir will attack. Once he's dead, take the key to Forelhost Stronghold from his corpse.)\nCaptain Valmir can be &lt;a href=\"pickpocket\"&gt;pickpocket&lt;/a&gt;ed or looted before entering to find \"&lt;a href=\"Valmir%27s%20Orders\"&gt;Valmir's Orders&lt;/a&gt;\" (they can also be\u00a0collected at the end of the quest). They reveal that he is an impostor, and that he is lying to the Dragonborn. The orders read:\n\"\"You will proceed to the ruins of Forelhost to retrieve the Mask from the &lt;a href=\"Dragon%20Cult\"&gt;Dragon Cult&lt;/a&gt; there. If you are discovered, impersonate an officer. It is unlikely that anyone from Skyrim will be clever enough to see through the disguise. Once you have obtained the Mask, bring it to &lt;a href=\"Labyrinthian%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Labyrinthian&lt;/a&gt;.\"\"\nForelhost Stronghold.\nInside the Stronghold, an iron door opens to a large room with a dead Imperial next to a campfire. Soon a &lt;a href=\"Dragon%20Cultist\"&gt;Dragon Cultist&lt;/a&gt; ghost will appear, ready for battle. Killing it will reveal an ash pile with a full set of &lt;a href=\"Ancient%20Nord%20Armor\"&gt;Ancient Nord Armor&lt;/a&gt;, a large quiver of &lt;a href=\"Ancient%20Nord%20Arrow\"&gt;Ancient Nord Arrow&lt;/a&gt;s, and Ancient Nord Weapons to take from it. There is an exit on the other (northwest) side of the room that is protected by a swinging log trap. Through the exit, the path leads to a 4-way intersection with the path to the left (southwest) blocked by an iron gate. Two more cultists are in this area. One of them is seen armed with a &lt;a href=\"Dragon%20Priest%20Dagger\"&gt;Dragon Priest Dagger&lt;/a&gt;, but will switch to using Frostbite once hostile, but the dagger can be looted from its ashes after slaying it. Turning right (northeast), a set of stairs leads up to a right hand T intersection. Straight ahead through an open wooden door is a dead end with a novice locked chest. To the right (southeast) is another path with a swinging blade trap that begins to move. Between the two swinging blades is the corpse of a &lt;a href=\"Stormcloaks\"&gt;Stormcloak&lt;/a&gt;.\nInside the next room there are two more cultists, and Skorm Snow-Strider's journal on a table. Reading the journal will give a hint of what happened here a long time ago. To the left of the table is an apprentice-locked chest. The doors on the left (southwest) lead to a large bedroom with two more cultists. In the southwest corner of the room, a path leads down a few steps, then turns left and goes\u00a0through a door to a large area overlooking a room with another Dragon Cultist. To the left (northeast), an arched stone bridge leads to a dead-end with an adept-locked chest.\nFrom the previous room, down the ramp is a smithy (with a &lt;a href=\"grindstone\"&gt;grindstone&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Anvil%20%28Smithing%29\"&gt;anvil&lt;/a&gt;, and a &lt;a href=\"workbench\"&gt;workbench&lt;/a&gt;). There are also several &lt;a href=\"Ingots%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;ingots&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"ore\"&gt;ore&lt;/a&gt;s lying about. A doorway to the southwest leads to a dining area with another cultist. Straight ahead, a small room has a bed upon which lies the corpse of a draugr with a leveled weapon. To the right (northwest) is a room with a ramp where two &lt;a href=\"Draugr%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;draugr&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Draugr%20Wight%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;draugr wights&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Draugr%20Scourge%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;draugr scourges&lt;/a&gt;, or &lt;a href=\"Draugr%20Deathlord%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;draugr deathlords&lt;/a&gt; are waiting in their coffins, with the ghost of another Dragon Cultist up by the table. After they are disposed of, the ramp up can be used to get to a boobytrapped &lt;a href=\"Containers%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;chest&lt;/a&gt;.\nBack down the ramp, the stone steps lead up to a table with a soul gem. Through the door on the right (northwest) is a corridor with burned corpses and a fire trap. On the right is a table with a leveled weapon. Straight ahead, a lever on the right opens the iron gate the was seen near the beginning of this dungeon. To the left (northwest) and down the steps, a leveled draugr will be waiting in front of the door to Forelhost Crypt.\nForelhost Crypt.\nThe corridor immediately turns right (northeast) and ends in a room with a T intersection. Against the wall straight ahead, a table holds a Grand soul gem. To the left is a corridor with a swinging blade trap and a cage beyond with a master-locked gate protecting a spiral set of steps down (if you picked the lock then continue to Forelhost Refectory).\nTo the right (southeast), a burial chamber leads to a large room with three doors out. The door on the left side of the northeast wall, when opened, causes a number of &lt;a href=\"Linen%20Wrap\"&gt;linen wraps&lt;/a&gt; to fall on the floor, but otherwise is a dead end. The door on the right side of the northeast wall is barred from the other side. The iron door on the southeast wall leads to another crypt area with a T intersection and a draugr. To the left (northeast) is a dead end. To the right (southwest), steps lead down to a room containing several draugr and many urns. Taking a 90 degree turn to the left leads to a door to the northeast that opens to a small room with a chest protected by a spiked gate trap. Back in the crypt area, the open door to the southwest leads to another small room with some minor loot.\nThe iron door to the northwest leads to a web-covered crypt passageway that turns right. At the next turn to the right, there are two pedestals with loot items on them. However, taking them will result in traps being triggered. The one on the left is a poison dart trap that continually raises and lowers, so it continually fires darts, and thus will be impossible to avoid unless it is not triggered in the first place. The path to the right leads to a swinging blade trap, then another small crypt area with several draugr and two copies of a\u00a0&lt;a href=\"Magic%20Rune%23Lightning%20Rune\"&gt;Lightning Rune Trap&lt;/a&gt;; one on the floor leading down stairs and one on a wall next to a leveled draugr resting in the lower niche until disturbed and climbs out. The path turns left (northeast), then right to a master-locked chest and a coffin. Turning left again, the path leads to a crypt area with three draugr. Turning right (southeast), the passage leads to a spiked gate trap and more draugr.\nThe path continues winding around, with more draugr and possibly a &lt;a href=\"Frost%20Atronach%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;frost atronach&lt;/a&gt;. Eventually, a large room is reached with a Draugr Wight Lord and several draugr. The Forelhost well key mentioned in the journal is in the chest to the right of the coffin. Up the ramp, in the northwest corner, is a bridge that leads to a spiral ramp. Up that ramp, a bridge leads to a soul gem trap. To the right (southwest) of the trap is a bridge across to the door bar for the door that was seen earlier. Out that door and turning right (northwest) eventually leads back to the first room in this section.\nNow it is possible to open the gate without picking the lock using the well key. The circular stairs end under water - swimming along the corridor to the north eventually leads to a large room with multiple levels. There is one\u00a0&lt;a href=\"Frostbite%20Spider%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;frostbite spider&lt;/a&gt;\u00a0(dead) and a few\u00a0&lt;a href=\"Skeever%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;skeevers&lt;/a&gt;. Near the dead spider are a quicksilver vein and a gold ore vein. Continuing to the right (northeast), again under water, there is a room with a &lt;a href=\"Note%20%28Forelhost%202%29\"&gt;note&lt;/a&gt; on the table and a dead draugr. The &lt;a href=\"Restoration%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Restoration&lt;/a&gt; skill book \"&lt;a href=\"The%20Exodus\"&gt;The Exodus&lt;/a&gt;\" is on a bookshelf behind the table. The door to the northeast leads to a large crypt room with a crushing pillar trap just inside. Leveled draugr will awake as soon as the room is entered. To the left (northwest) is another crypt with several dead draugr and the entrance to Forelhost Refectory.\nForelhost Refectory.\nUp the stairs are more leveled draugr. The stairs turn left (southeast), and at the top on the left side are a pair of leveled armor pieces\u00a0on pedestal in front of a large carving on the wall. Removing them sets off a dart trap. Straight ahead (southeast) is a dead end with a chest on the left side and another piece of armor on a pedestal. To the right (southwest) is a large room with tables in the center, an iron gate directly across from the entrance that cannot be opened, many urns, at least one live draugr, and a set of double iron doors to the left (southeast). On the table directly ahead of the room's entrance lies another &lt;a href=\"Note%20%28Forelhost%201%29\"&gt;note&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe iron doors lead down stairs to where a draugr patrols. Across the fire pit from the stairs is a fire rune trap. The path turns right (southwest), the right again to a room full of &lt;a href=\"Deathbell%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;deathbell&lt;/a&gt;, snowberries, and mountain flowers (red, blue, and purple) plants with multiple draugr. On the left side is a table with a note of \"&lt;a href=\"Orders%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;orders&lt;/a&gt;.\" An adept-locked chest is underneath the log ramp up at the northwest end of the room.\nUp the ramp, a 90 degree turn to the right (northeast) leads to the other side of the iron gate that could not be opened before\u2014a lever on the right side opens it. Back at the top of the ramp, there are two alchemy labs to the left (northwest). On a throne you can find a dead draugr, who, according to the \"&lt;a href=\"Alchemist%27s%20Note\"&gt;Alchemist's Note&lt;/a&gt;\" on the table on the left directly in front of you when entering the room, is Head Alchemist Froda. It seems that Rahgot had her killed for her disobedience. \"&lt;a href=\"Rahgot%27s%20Reply\"&gt;Rahgot's Reply&lt;/a&gt;\" is beside her on the throne.\nUp the log ramp are two more thrones. To the right is a room with a lightning soul gem trap and a leveled draugr. On the right (southeast) through open double iron doors is the balcony seen from below where a draugr is waiting. The trap can be disarmed with an arrow, and then the draugr dispatched. To the left of the trap, the room continues northeast into a library-like room. On the right side after the first corner is the &lt;a href=\"Glass%20Dragon%20Claw\"&gt;glass dragon claw&lt;/a&gt;, which is guarded by a leveled draugr. The spear-gate in the room will open when the claw is picked up. To its left is an master-locked door that contains a leveled shield, a leveled potion and a Honed Ancient Nord Sword. A master-locked door to the right provides access to the back of the lightning trap. Further on, the path leads up to a wooden door and a room with an &lt;a href=\"arcane%20enchanter\"&gt;arcane enchanter&lt;/a&gt; and several more draugr. At the southeast end of the room is a trapped chest. To the right, the path winds generally southeast until the Dragon Claw hallway is reached. The keyhole can be activated (fox, owl, snake, from top to bottom). Behind the door, stairs lead up into the last chamber.\u00a0\nFinal battle.\nWhen the Dragonborn reaches the top of the stairs, several draugr lords will emerge and the coffin containing &lt;a href=\"Rahgot\"&gt;Rahgot&lt;/a&gt; opens. A &lt;a href=\"Magic%20Rune\"&gt;magic rune&lt;/a&gt; can be placed on the two coffins at the bottom of the stairs to draw out the draugr inside. When the battle starts, the dragon priest will rise and use his dragon priest staff, most likely a &lt;a href=\"Dragon%20Priest%20Staff%20%28Wall%20of%20Fire%29\"&gt;Wall of Fire&lt;/a&gt;. After defeating Rahgot and the draugr lords, Rahgot's corpse can be looted for the &lt;a href=\"Rahgot%20Mask\"&gt;Rahgot Mask&lt;/a&gt;, the staff and the Forelhost balcony key. A chest on the left (northeast) side of the room holds leveled loot. Once all the loot is collected, the large door on the southeast end of the room can be opened with the key. The door leads outside, where the &lt;a href=\"Word%20Walls%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;word wall&lt;/a&gt; to learn part of the &lt;a href=\"Storm%20Call\"&gt;Storm Call&lt;/a&gt; shout is on the right (southwest) side of the balcony.\nEnd of Quest.\nCaptain Valmir can be returned to by jumping down to the courtyard where he is or going back through the tomb.\nThe Captain will be engaged in a conversation\u00a0with either a &lt;a href=\"Stormcloak%20Soldier\"&gt;Stormcloak&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"Imperial%20Soldier%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Imperial soldier&lt;/a&gt; (the opposite of the\u00a0side chosen in the &lt;a href=\"Skyrim%20Civil%20War\"&gt;civil war&lt;/a&gt;. If the Dragonborn has not yet chosen\u00a0a side in the war,\u00a0then it depends on who was chosen in the beginning, &lt;a href=\"Hadvar\"&gt;Hadvar&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"Ralof\"&gt;Ralof&lt;/a&gt;) when getting close. After Valmir stumbles over his words upon discovering the Dragonborn returned and overheard everything, both men draw their swords and attack. As soon as Valmir is dead the quest is completed. \"&lt;a href=\"Valmir%27s%20Orders\"&gt;Valmir's Orders&lt;/a&gt;\", located in his inventory, explain that he was impersonating an officer and implies that he was hired by someone from outside of\u00a0Skyrim.\nIt is possible to kill Captain Valmir and still complete the quest, although the Dragonborn will not receive any indications that the quest has been activated. This can be done as simply as engaging &lt;a href=\"Sneak%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;sneak&lt;/a&gt; mode and shooting Valmir from a distance while undetected, or casting a destruction spell on him. If this is the case, the Dragonborn can still explore the ruin and kill the dragon priest, while an indication that the quest has been completed will appear upon collecting the Priest's mask."}

An easy way to tell which is the real Sigdis is to target them. The real Sigdis will show damage if he has been injured, where as the clones will always have full health. If a clone is attacked, it will automatically disappear. Alternatively, in the first battle Sigdis will not glow as much as the clones do, while in the second battle he will also wear a different helmet from them. When he dies, he will have the weapon Gauldur Blackbow, a Gauldur Amulet Fragment (stamina version), and a &lt;a href=\"Writ%20of%20Sealing\"&gt;Writ of Sealing&lt;/a&gt;, along with some &lt;a href=\"arrows%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;arrows&lt;/a&gt; and sometimes minor loot. As he and his clones use Unrelenting Force frequently, it is hard to use melee attacks on them.

Once the stone is removed, it shuts the gate it was supporting and transports the player back to &lt;a href=\"Tamriel\"&gt;Tamriel&lt;/a&gt;, next to the now-destroyed gate. If placed somewhere outside of a container, a sigil stone rotates slowly and emits a mechanical sound not unlike the ambient sound inside of the Sigilium Sanguis room it came from. Sparks continuously appear near the surface of the stone, are pulled in, and vanish. If multiple stones are placed together, they rotate independently and do not synchronize. If they are moved around using the grab function, the sparks will stay for a few animation cycles in the previous location.\nUsefulness.\nOnce removed, Sigil Stones are placed in the &lt;a href=\"Inventory\"&gt;Inventory&lt;/a&gt;.

Each stone can provide one of two possible effects: a defensive constant effect on jewelry or armor, or an offensive effect, that expends charges, on weapons. The constant effects never need to be recast; they also stack with newly cast effects.\nSoul Gems can only be used by members of the Mages Guild of Apprentice or higher rank, at the Arcane University. By contrast, anyone can use Sigil Stones to enchant other items in their inventory.\nWith Soul Gems on weapons, multiple enchantments or a radius of effect can be selected; Sigil Stones cannot do either. Sigil Stones can give a slightly greater amount of Absorb Health (25 instead of 22) than a Grand Soul Gem, but much less elemental damage (25 rather than 40).\nFor armor, the outlook is much brighter. Soul Gems give a maximum of 9% elemental shields, but Transcendent Sigil Stones (albeit only available at and after player level 17) can provide 25% as a constant effect.\nVariants.\nSigil Stones' enchantments vary in effect and quality based on the players level when the stone is obtained. All stones have a name prefix which refers to how powerful the enchantment will be, in order from weakest to strongest:\nPossible effects.\nThe 30 possible effects are as follows:"}

Lord Jarol has an estate northwest of &lt;a href=\"Anvil%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Anvil&lt;/a&gt;. If asked for advice on how to get in, Terenus will tell you about a smuggler's tunnel in &lt;a href=\"The%20Withered%20Rose\"&gt;The Withered Rose&lt;/a&gt;, a hostel south of the estate. \nHead to the Withered Rose and break into the cellar; the door will be locked. Once inside, head through the door to the Smuggler Tunnels. These tunnels will be filled with smugglers and traps, so mind your step and stay hidden to avoid a bounty. At the end, head up the ladder to the estate courtyard. From there, sneak your way past the guards to the estate building and pick the lock to get in. Proceed ahead and up the stairs, and you will find a \"&lt;a href=\"Letter%20from%20the%20Governor\"&gt;Letter from the Governor&lt;/a&gt;\" that talks about secret rooms beneath the estate. \nHead down and into the mansion's wine cellar. In there, on the desk, you will find a \"&lt;a href=\"Contractor%27s%20Note\"&gt;Contractor's Note&lt;/a&gt;\". This note will tell you how to get into the secret chambers: there are three fake wine casks. You must knock on the two closest to the lanterns. There are two casks to which this applies; knock on both of them to open a passage in a wine cask on the side of the room farthest from the entrance. \nProceed to sneak through the halls; there will be guards to avoid and trip wires to watch out for, but no branching paths to confuse you.

Continue through the halls and into the caverns below; ad the end of the caves, you will find Lord Jarol. The Governor and the Count have just left. You can either sneak up on Jarol and use the Blade of Woe to kill him, or you can attack him regularly, though the latter will get you a bounty. Either way, once Jarol is dead, leave the caves and return to Speaker Terenus in the lighthouse to finish your initiation.\nTerenus will tell you where to find the &lt;a href=\"Dark%20Brotherhood%20Sanctuary%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Dark Brotherhood Sanctuary&lt;/a&gt;; it is in the north of the region, off the Gold Road.

The settlement is built along the &lt;a href=\"Eastern%20Pass\"&gt;Eastern Pass&lt;/a&gt;, which connects &lt;a href=\"Sunhold\"&gt;Sunhold&lt;/a&gt; to the rest of the province via the land. The main facility is located on the southern end of the zoo, with a private park inside the conservatory for special animals. The zoo has many exhibits, some for a pack of &lt;a href=\"Lion\"&gt;Lion&lt;/a&gt;s and some for large creatures like a &lt;a href=\"Mammoth\"&gt;Mammoth&lt;/a&gt;. To the north is the central plaza, with the road leading to &lt;a href=\"Central%20Summerset\"&gt;Central Summerset&lt;/a&gt; and Shimmerene. For the most part, Sil-Var-Woad is a park with various animal pens; the paths are open for the moving customer, as well as open areas for lounging.\nHistory.\n&lt;a href=\"Second%20Era\"&gt;Second Era&lt;/a&gt;.\nDuring the &lt;a href=\"Interregnum\"&gt;Interregnum&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"2E%20583\"&gt;2E 583&lt;/a&gt;, the settlement of Sil-Var-Woad was under the administration of &lt;a href=\"Conservator%20Vinelore\"&gt;Conservator Vinelore&lt;/a&gt;. When she became older, &lt;a href=\"Queen%20Ayrenn\"&gt;Queen Ayrenn&lt;/a&gt; had her beloved pet &lt;a href=\"Indrik\"&gt;Indrik&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Lotus%20%28Indrik%29\"&gt;Lotus&lt;/a&gt; be brought to and cared for in Sil-Var-Woad by the staff. Lotus was primarily taken care of by &lt;a href=\"Talomar\"&gt;Talomar&lt;/a&gt;, a High Elf staff member of the zoo. Talomar had grown bond of the Indrik, giving the utmost care to the magic deer. A member of the &lt;a href=\"Eyes%20of%20the%20Queen\"&gt;Eyes of the Queen&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Elise%20Mallon\"&gt;Elise Mallon&lt;/a&gt; was sent to Sil-Var-Woad to uncover strange experiments done by the animals, and to garner a distraction, Mallon had unleashed all of the animals out of their pens, running amuck throughout Sil-Var-Woad. With the help of a wandering &lt;a href=\"Vestige\"&gt;Nebarra&lt;/a&gt;, Talomar was able to find Lotus amidst the chaos, who was then taken by Conservator Vinelore. In reality, Vinelore had experimented with the animals, turning them into abominations to use against Queen Ayrenn. Before she could do anything with Lotus, she was killed by the Nebarra. Sil-Var-Woad was restored to order.\n&lt;a href=\"Third%20Era\"&gt;Third Era&lt;/a&gt;.\nDuring the &lt;a href=\"Imperial%20Simulacrum\"&gt;Imperial Simulacrum&lt;/a&gt; from &lt;a href=\"3E%20389\"&gt;3E 389&lt;/a&gt; to &lt;a href=\"3E%20399\"&gt;3E 399&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Emperor\"&gt;Emperor&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Uriel%20Septim%20VII\"&gt;Uriel Septim VII&lt;/a&gt; was imprisoned along with &lt;a href=\"Talin%20Warhaft\"&gt;Talin Warhaft&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;a href=\"Deadlands\"&gt;Deadlands&lt;/a&gt; by &lt;a href=\"Jagar%20Tharn\"&gt;Jagar Tharn&lt;/a&gt;. Tharn planned for months to capture the throne, and he was able to achieve so in the span of ten years. Tharn had a powerful weapon called the &lt;a href=\"Staff%20of%20Chaos\"&gt;Staff of Chaos&lt;/a&gt;, and he split it into nine pieces and scattered them across Tamriel, the staff was the only thing keeping Uriel Septim and Warhaft in &lt;a href=\"Oblivion\"&gt;Oblivion&lt;/a&gt;. A warrior escaped his clutches and traveled all corners of Tamriel to retrieve the missing pieces. The hero was known as the &lt;a href=\"Eternal%20Champion\"&gt;Eternal Champion&lt;/a&gt;, and he assembled the staff and defeated Jagar Tharn at the &lt;a href=\"Imperial%20Palace\"&gt;Imperial Palace&lt;/a&gt;.

He knew that his name was not yet legendary, and it was best to be polite. \u201cAnd you are?\u201d\n\u201cMy name would have no meaning to you, but I'm Erer Darothil,\u201d he said, raising a glass of &lt;a href=\"Greef%20%28Morrowind%29\"&gt;greef&lt;/a&gt;. \u201cI hail from the region of Ghostgate which is how I heard your name. Are you on an adventure as we speak?\u201d\n\u201cYes,\u201d said Silverthorn, with a grim expression. \u201cI'm challenged to rid The &lt;a href=\"Grazelands\"&gt;Grazelands&lt;/a&gt; of a rogue &lt;a href=\"battlemage\"&gt;battlemage&lt;/a&gt; by the name of Egroamaro.\u201d\n\u201cI've heard of him as well,\u201d said Darothil. \u201cHe is said to be very powerful, an implacable foe.\u201d\n\u201cThat is why I'm drinking now,\u201d sighed Silverthorn. \u201cSo tell me, what is your profession?\u201d\n\u201cI do nothing,\u201d said Darothil with some measure of pride. \u201cBut in my youth, I used to teach the skills of &lt;a href=\"Illusion%20%28Morrowind%29\"&gt;Illusion&lt;/a&gt; at the &lt;a href=\"University%20of%20Gwylim\"&gt;University of Gwylim&lt;/a&gt;.\u201d\n\u201cPerhaps you can help me then,\u201d said Silverthorn, suddenly excited. \u201cCan you teach the spell &lt;a href=\"Silence%20%28Morrowind%29\"&gt;Silence&lt;/a&gt;? I can certainly pay you.\u201d\n\u201cI know that spell,\u201d said Darothil. \u201cYou might find &lt;a href=\"Invisibility%20%28Morrowind%29\"&gt;Invisibility&lt;/a&gt; very helpful as well, or perhaps &lt;a href=\"Darkness\"&gt;Darkness&lt;/a&gt; which would allow you to sneak up on old Egroamaro.\u201d\n\u201cNo,\u201d said Silverthorn firmly. \u201cI only have time to learn one spell. I have to kill Egroamaro, collect the award, and be back in &lt;a href=\"Gnisis\"&gt;Gnisis&lt;/a&gt; as quickly as possible. My wife worries when I'm away.\u201d\nDarothil agreed and, as the two settled back in their seats at the cornerclub and tossed back glasses of greef, the old man shared his knowledge of the spell. He explained what it truly meant to bend sound, creating a cone of silence as glass can bend light. He had Silverthorn close his eyes while he tapped the side of his glass, making him picture the sound as the physical entity it was, before it was extinguished.\nThe adventurer, after a few hours of instruction, paid the old teacher and set off on his way. &lt;a href=\"Indoranyon\"&gt;Indoranyon&lt;/a&gt;, Egroamaro's stronghold, was not far from &lt;a href=\"Sadrith%20Mora%20%28Morrowind%29\"&gt;Sadrith Mora&lt;/a&gt;, and he soon saw the blight and ruin that was the battlemage's calling card. Delving into the depths of the ruins, Silverthorn was set upon by the servitors of Egroamaro, living and undead. With his enchanted ebony blade, he cut through legions before facing the master himself in the desolate main hall.\nEgroamaro bowed to his adversary sardonically, and then prepared to unleash a fireball to incinerate him. Before he had uttered the first word of the spell, he suddenly found that all the creaking and sighing of the ruins around him had been stilled. He opened his voice to speak, but there was no sound. Silverthorn took his time, strolling across the length of the hall, before dispatching the battlemage with one stroke of his blade.\nThe adventurer rushed back to the &lt;a href=\"Tribunal%20Temple\"&gt;Tribunal Temple&lt;/a&gt; where he had received his quest, accepted the gold and the thanks, and was back in his house in Gnisis but a few days later. His wife Liah was beside herself with worry.\n\u201cAll I could do night after night is toss and turn. I kept imagining you burned to ashes by that battlemage, and where would that leave me? Do we have enough gold that I could support myself if you, Saint &lt;a href=\"Seryn\"&gt;Seryn&lt;/a&gt; let it not be so, were killed during one of these jaunts? I don't think so. Why couldn't you get a nice position at the &lt;a href=\"Fighters%20Guild%20%28Morrowind%29\"&gt;Fighters Guild&lt;/a&gt; right here in town? I hear they're looking for a trainer for the Imperial Guard. I know, I know, you want a life of adventure and danger and freedom, but if you'd only take one moment to think of me, stuck here all by myself, worrying about you. I suppose you'd like it if I took more of an interest in your work, but it's like I was telling Ser Calissiah Vignum the other day, I said Calissah, what good is a husband--\u201d\nLiah continued to talk, deaf to the fact that her words were dead before they left her mouth. Silverthorn smiled and nodded his head, enjoying the silence. He could have killed Egroamaro without the spell, he considered, but he could not have survived his wife."}

The left-most (southwest) passage has no enemies, but contains an urn and a treasure chest filled with loot (this is where &lt;a href=\"Amaund%20Motierre\"&gt;Amaund Motierre&lt;/a&gt; is for the &lt;a href=\"Dark%20Brotherhood%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Dark Brotherhood&lt;/a&gt; quests). The next doorway (to the west northwest) leads to an iron door and then a crypt with a few &lt;a href=\"draugr%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;draugr&lt;/a&gt; lying at rest. The path continues straight down into a winding cavern with another draugr warrior lurking about. The last room has a boss level draugr defending it (depending upon level, there may be two draugr).\nThis draugr has the ability to use the &lt;a href=\"Unrelenting%20Force%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Unrelenting Force&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Disarm\"&gt;Disarm&lt;/a&gt; shout and uses frost-based destruction magic, such as &lt;a href=\"Ice%20Spike%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Ice Spike&lt;/a&gt;, making it a challenging opponent. There are rusted metal plates on the floor. Stepping on them causes a metal spike to jut out and stab the Dragonborn if not avoided. On the wall behind the throne the draugr was sitting on, the &lt;a href=\"ceremonial%20axe\"&gt;ceremonial axe&lt;/a&gt; hangs. There is also a copy of the skillbook \"&lt;a href=\"Mace%20Etiquette\"&gt;Mace Etiquette&lt;/a&gt;\" on the right-hand side of the throne.\nBack in the main cavern, the opening to the northeast should be followed (skipping the stairs to the north for now). This leads to a winding tunnel and eventually to the middle level of a multi-level room with several draugr opponents including a &lt;a href=\"Draugr%20Wight%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;draugr wight&lt;/a&gt;, capable of casting frost Destruction spells.\nThere is a swinging door trap covering the opening from the lower part of the room to the northeast. This area narrows into a corridor that can be used to trap the draugr. By stepping on the trap and moving out of the way, the door will hit the enemy. Another option is to cast rune spells on the tunnel floor so the enemies trigger it as they run by. If timed properly, a &lt;a href=\"dragon%20shout\"&gt;dragon shout&lt;/a&gt;\u00a0will\u00a0hit multiple targets as they cluster in the tunnel as well.\nAfter the room is cleared, through this opening and up a few stairs is a room with another draugr. There are paths to the left and right. The left path leads to stairs that lead back to the middle level of the multi-level room, but on the other side from where the room was first entered. The right-hand tunnel leads up onto a high catwalk at the top of the multi-level room. Across it is a room with an ancient Nord helmet. One draugr will attack in this room. Through the iron door is the &lt;a href=\"ceremonial%20sword\"&gt;ceremonial sword&lt;/a&gt; in a crypt. Two more draugr will immediately attack as soon as the room is entered.\nWith the two Ceremonial weapons in hand, back in the main cavern again, it is now time to proceed up the stairs to the north. In this room there is a large table surrounded by candles. There's a leveled shield on the table and some embalming tools. Upon activating the Elder's Cairn door on the opposite side of the room, the two ceremonial weapons are taken. Now the door to the Elder's Cairn can be opened.\nThrough a hallway, there is a burned corpse kneeling in front of a fireplace, kneeling on a scroll of Ice Storm. In the next room there are two draugr who should be dealt with here or else they may drop down off of the bridge and sneak up behind. In this room, there is a rhythmic swishing sound which fades to become the sound of Nord chanting, indicating that the words of a Shout are nearby. But that also means there is a strong defender...\nDown the hall is a narrow passage. At the end is a large room with Kvenel. Depending on the Dragonborn's level, equipment and skills, he can be a very challenging opponent. Nevertheless, even with a low archery and sneak skill it's fairly easy to kill him from behind the row of pillars circling the room. The strategy is to only fire when hidden and to make sure the Dragonborn can move easily to the other side of the room as soon as an arrow has been fired.\nAfter killing Kvenel, his corpse holds &lt;a href=\"Eduj\"&gt;Eduj&lt;/a&gt; and other loot, whilst &lt;a href=\"Okin\"&gt;Okin&lt;/a&gt;\u00a0can be found on his remains once he is killed.\u00a0Upstairs is some good loot which may include a &lt;a href=\"Dragon%20Priest%20Dagger\"&gt;dragon priest dagger&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"One-Handed%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;One-Handed&lt;/a&gt; skill book \"&lt;a href=\"Night%20Falls%20on%20Sentinel\"&gt;Night Falls on Sentinel&lt;/a&gt;\". There is also a &lt;a href=\"Word%20Walls%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Word Wall&lt;/a&gt; up the steps to the west for the shout &lt;a href=\"Aura%20Whisper\"&gt;Aura Whisper&lt;/a&gt;. There may be a skeleton back at the entrance after defeating &lt;a href=\"Kvenel%20the%20Tongue\"&gt;Kvenel the Tongue&lt;/a&gt;."}

After the &lt;a href=\"Red%20Mountain\"&gt;Red Mountain&lt;/a&gt; erupted, most Silt Striders on Vvardenfell were wiped out, but some are still believed to live on the mainland of Morrowind.\nCaravaneer and fares.\nEach Silt Strider has a driver, or caravaneer, that navigates the Silt Strider to its destination. Prices for passage are dependent on the destination, embarking point, and disposition of the caravener to the passenger, which can be increased with successful &lt;a href=\"Speechcraft%20%28Morrowind%29\"&gt;Admiration or Bribes&lt;/a&gt;. Caravaners may have extended dialogue options concerning their cities and its surroundings. All caravaners in &lt;a href=\"Morrowind\"&gt;Morrowind&lt;/a&gt; are Dunmer. Silt Strider routes travel inland in the &lt;a href=\"Ascadian%20Isles%20%28Morrowind%29\"&gt;Ascadian Isles&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"West%20Gash%20%28Morrowind%29\"&gt;West Gash&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Ashlands%20%28Morrowind%29\"&gt;Ashlands&lt;/a&gt; regions.\nBiology and culture.\nThe 20 meter tall creatures' shells are cut away both to expose sensitive tissues beneath, which can be goaded with minimal force to guide them, and to make room for passengers and cargo. Silt Striders ship cargo, as evidenced by the Silt Strider docks constructed in cities such &lt;a href=\"Gnisis%20%28Morrowind%29\"&gt;Gnisis&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Molag%20Mar%20%28Morrowind%29\"&gt;Molag Mar&lt;/a&gt; to aid in the loading and unloading of trade goods. Their shells are so strong, they can even withstand the harshest weather conditions.\nSilt Striders are not hostile and cannot be attacked.\nRoutes.\nThere are routes between each group of towns with the same colored background, and between towns of different backgrounds that are adjacent on the chart."}

I've received accolades from my friends and allies, been branded with curses and other foul description by my enemies, but no title has been more hurtful and undeserved than the one I carry with me now - the one I'll most likely carry with me to my grave. They call me \"the Butcher of &lt;a href=\"Bravil%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Bravil&lt;/a&gt;.\"\nThe war in &lt;a href=\"Cyrodiil%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Cyrodiil&lt;/a&gt; was in full swing when suddenly a new danged appeared to threaten &lt;a href=\"Imperial%20City%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Imperial City&lt;/a&gt;. My soldiers were enjoying a much-deserved break from battle when chains fell from the sky. Some claimed one of the alliances had called upon strange and deadly magic to harass Imperial City, while others were sure that one &lt;a href=\"Daedric%20Princes\"&gt;Daedric Prince&lt;/a&gt; or another was behind this latest indignation. For my part, I didn't care if it was &lt;a href=\"Queen%20Ayrenn%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Queen Ayrenn&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"Molag%20Bal%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Molag Bal&lt;/a&gt;. I just knew I had to get the soldiers under my change away from there as quickly as possible.\nThe goal before me was simple: Survive. Not die trying to defend the Imperial City from an enemy we didn't understand. It was to live to fight another day when victory was more assured. Some call me coward for running as I did, but I saved a full legion's worth of soldiers with my actions. Of course, fleeing from the city as quickly as we did, we were ill prepared for surviving in the wilds beyond the city walls. We needed to regroup, resupply, and determine a prudent course of action. With these things in mind, I ordered my legion to head south and away from city.\nBravil is a squalid little town south of the Imperial City, located on the banks of the &lt;a href=\"Niben%20Bay\"&gt;Niben Bay&lt;/a&gt;. To say that Bravil is a poor town is an understatement. The people there would be happy to be risen to that economic level. They lived in wooden shacks in a burrow. They didn't have much, but what they did have was desperately needed by me and my legion. It was their duty to aid us, for the welfare and glory of the Empire. I expected that quite succinctly to Bravil's mayor.\nAnd Bravil's mayor graciously refused my request. \"The food stores we have, pitiful thought they may be, are vital to the survival of Bravil and its people,\" he explained. \"Surely you understand why I must say no, Captain, and humbly ask that you and your soldiers move on.\"\nTo say that the man infuriated me is like saying that the &lt;a href=\"Jorunn%20the%20Skald-King\"&gt;Skald King&lt;/a&gt; is only a slightly drunk fool. But I understood his dilemma. If I took the town's food supply, he'd hate to watch as half of his citizens slowly died of starvation as the cold winter settled over the town and the surrounding area. The solution was simple, though it grieved me to give the order. My soldiers would hate to eliminate half the town's population. That would give the remaining citizens a chance to scrounge up enough food to make it though the winter.\nHere I thought I was helping these pathetic creatures, but did they thank us? No. The rest of the town rose up against us. In the end, we were forced to slaughter a good deal more than half - including the mayor, whom I hold responsible for this entire situation. We gathered up the supplies - as well as a number of valuable items to help finance our efforts - and took our leave of Bravil.\nIt was a few days later, when we approached another small settlement, that I discovered that word of what happened at Bravil had begun to spread, and the story had grown all out of proportion. They were calling me \"the Butcher of Bravil,\" regarding me as a sort of villain who went out of her way to kill innocent civilians. They know nothing about war and the hard decisions that a commander must make in the field. Would they rather my soldiers starved? How would we protect them and defend Cyrodiil then? It also came to my attention that Queen Ayrenn had sent one of her damned &lt;a href=\"Razum-dar%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Eyes&lt;/a&gt; to track me down, recover for my so-called was crime.\nI sent the bulk of my legion back to rendezvous with the rest of the army outside the Imperial City. Meanwhile, I took a small squad and made it for the &lt;a href=\"Gold%20Coast%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Gold Coast&lt;/a&gt;. I would face the &lt;a href=\"Eyes%20of%20the%20Queen\"&gt;Queen's Eye&lt;/a&gt; in a &lt;a href=\"Garlas%20Agea%20%28Online%29\"&gt;place of my own choosing&lt;/a&gt;. Then we'll see whose justice actually prevails."}
{"id": "6203", "revid": "32045548", "url": "https://elderscrolls.fandom.com/wiki?curid=6203", "title": "The Buying Game", "text": "The Buying Game is a &lt;a href=\"book\"&gt;book&lt;/a&gt; in , , , and .\nContents.\nSo many people simply buy the items they need at the price they are given. It's a very sad state of affairs, when the game is really open to all, you don't need an invitation. And it is a game, the &lt;a href=\"Mercantile%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;game of bargaining&lt;/a&gt;, to be played seriously and, I hasten to add, politely. In &lt;a href=\"Elsweyr\"&gt;Elsweyr&lt;/a&gt;, it is common for the shop-owner to offer the prospective buyer tea or sweetmeats and engage in polite conversation before commencing the business. This eminently civilized tradition has a practical purpose, allowing the buyer to observe the wares for sale. It is considered impolite not to accept, though it does not imply obligation on the part of the buyer.\nWhether this particular custom is part of the culture or not, it's wise for the buyer and seller to greet one another with smiles and warm salutations, like gladiators honoring one another before the battle.\nBargaining is expected all over &lt;a href=\"Tamriel\"&gt;Tamriel&lt;/a&gt;, but the game can be broken if one's offer is so preposterously low that it insults the shop-keeper. If you are offered something for ten gold pieces, try offering six and see where that takes you.\nDo not look like you're very interested, but do not mock the quality of the goods, even if they deserve it. Much better to admire the quality of workmanship, but comment that, regretfully, you simply cannot afford such a price. When the shop-keeper compliments your taste, smile, but try to resist the flattery.\nA lot of the game depends on recognizing the types of shop-keepers and not automatically assuming that the rural merchant is ignorant and easily fooled, or the rapacious city merchant is selling shoddy merchandise. Caravans, it should be mentioned, are always good places to go to buy or trade.\nKnowing what you're buying and from whom is a talent bought only after years of practice. Know the specialties of certain regions and merchants before you even step foot in a shop. Recognize too the prejudices of the region. In &lt;a href=\"Morrowind\"&gt;Morrowind&lt;/a&gt; where I hail from, for example, &lt;a href=\"Argonians\"&gt;Argonians&lt;/a&gt; are viewed with a certain amount of suspicion. Don't be surprised or insulted if the shopkeepers follow you around the shop, assuming you're going to steal something. Similarly, &lt;a href=\"Nords\"&gt;Nords&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Bretons\"&gt;Bretons&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Cyrodiils\"&gt;Cyrodiils&lt;/a&gt; are sometimes treated coolly by merchants in the &lt;a href=\"Summurset%20Isles\"&gt;Summurset Isles&lt;/a&gt;. Of course, I don't know any shopkeepers anywhere, no matter their open-mindedness, who aren't alerted when a &lt;a href=\"Khajiit\"&gt;Khajiit&lt;/a&gt; or a &lt;a href=\"Bosmer\"&gt;Bosmer&lt;/a&gt; enters their shop. Even Khajiiti and Bosmeri shopkeepers.\nIf you see something you really like or need, buy it then and there at the best price you can get. I cannot tell you how many times I passed up a rare and interesting relic, assuming that I could find it elsewhere in the region, perhaps at a larger town at a better price. Too late, I discovered I was wrong, and when I returned to the shop weeks later, the item I wanted was gone. Better to get a great purchase at a decent price and discover it again at a worse price than to miss out on your opportunities for ownership. Occasionally impulsiveness is the best buying strategy.\nSense the moves of the game, and everyone can win."}

He decided he would save some gold and decided to cross the pine forest on foot.\nThe first day of his journey was rather uneventful, the soldier stuck to the main path and kept a brisk pace. When it started getting dark he set up his bed roll, built a small fire, and cooked up some rabbit he had caught. \"A fine day indeed\", he thought to himself as he fell asleep.\nPartway through the evening, the soldier was woken up by soft sobbing in the distance. He grabbed his sword, assuming it to be a bandit trick, but pretended to sleep so he could get the jump on them. After a few minutes, the sobbing started moving away from his camp until he could no longer\u00a0hear it. For the rest of the night, he\u00a0slept with one eye open.\nDay two, the soldier awoken with what rotten sleep he could catch and started off through the forest at a quicker pace, intending to put distance between himself and what ever he had heard last night. As the day went on, it began to rain heavy, so the soldier built himself a shelter for the evening, so he could remain dry as he slept.\nIt took him a little longer to fall asleep with thoughts of the previous night in mind, but eventually slept.\nThis time he awoke to sobbing that sounded like it was right outside his shelter. The soldier grabbed his sword, and crawled out of the shelter. In front of the fire, he saw the back of a ghostly woman sobbing into her hands.\nThe soldier mustered his courage, and asked her what was wrong.\nNo answer.\nHe began to slowly approach, but before he could reach her, she turned and screamed at him. The ghostly woman raised an axe and ran at the soldier, disappearing before she made contact. The soldier took off into the night with just his sword in his hand. He ran until the first light of dawn where he started down the road again, as fast as he could move.\nThe third day was bright and sunny, but the soldier, rattled and sleepless, didn't even notice. He moved as fast as he could, trying to get through the forest before night fall.\nAs darkness began to fall, he saw a cabin just off the road and thought to himself it would be a good place to bunker down for the night. After arriving at the cabin, he spent some time blocking the doors and the windows, nothing would get in. Despite his preparations, he could not sleep. He sat in what used to be the cabin's bedroom staring at the barricaded door shaking. Eventually he could keep his eyes open no longer, and fell asleep.\nThis time he awoke to laughing on the other side of the barricaded door. It sounded like the woman before, but he refused to believe it was her. The soldier burst through the door to find the ghostly woman from the night before, staring at the ground, laughing hysterically, with axe in hand.\nHe began to recklessly attack the ghostly woman but he felt his strikes were less effective. He used a scroll of &lt;a href=\"Fireball%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Fireball&lt;/a&gt; which drew a scream from her and she exploded, disappearing. The ordeal was over, the ghost was gone.\nThe soldier slept well that night, and the next day made excellent distance through the woods. As the sun began to set he came out the other side of the forest and looked back, remembering the days before.\nAs he turned and started walking away from the woods, he could swear he could hear the sobbing again."}

Now, &lt;a href=\"Breton\"&gt;Breton&lt;/a&gt; women are fairly common in the Rat and the Pot. As a breed, they seem inclined to wander far from their perches in &lt;a href=\"High%20Rock\"&gt;High Rock&lt;/a&gt;. Old Breton women, however, are not so migratory, and the wizened old biddy drew attention to herself, wandering about the room, talking to everyone.\nNimloth and Oediad were at their usual places, drinking their usual stuff. Oediad was showing off a prize he had picked up in some illicit manner -- a colossal diamond, large as a baby's hand, and clear as spring water. I was admiring it when I heard the creaking of old bones behind me.\n\"Good day to you, friends,\" said the old woman. \"My name is &lt;a href=\"Abelle%20Chriditte\"&gt;Abelle Chriditte&lt;/a&gt;, and I am in need of financial assistance to facilitate my transportation to &lt;a href=\"Ald%20Redaynia\"&gt;Ald Redaynia&lt;/a&gt;.\"\n\"You'll want to see the Temple for charity,\" said Nimloth curtly.\n\"I am not looking for charity,\" said Abelle. \"I'm looking to barter services.\"\n\"Don't make me sick, old woman,\" laughed Oediad.\n\"Did you say your name was Abelle Chriditte?\" I asked, \"Are you related to Abelle Chriditte, the High Rock alchemist?\"\n\"Closely related,\" she said, with a cackle. \"We are the same person. Perhaps I could prepare you a potion in exchange for gold? I noticed that you have in your possession a very fine diamond. The magical qualities of diamonds are boundless.\"\n\"Sorry, old woman, I ain't giving it up for magic. It was trouble enough stealing this one,\" said Oediad. \"I've got a fence who'll trade it for gold.\"\n\"But your fence will demand a certain percentage, will he not? What if I could give you a potion of invisibility in exchange? In return for that diamond, you could have the means to steal many more. A very fair exchange of services, I would say.\"\n\"It would be, but I have no gold to give you,\" said Oediad.\n\"I'll take what remains of the diamond after I've made the potion,\" said Abelle. \"If you took it to the &lt;a href=\"Mages%20Guild\"&gt;Mages Guild&lt;/a&gt;, you'd have to supply all the other ingredients and pay for it as well. But I learned my craft in the wild, where no Potion-makers existed to dissolve diamonds into dust. When you must do it all by hand, by simple skill, you are blessed with remnants those fool potion-makers at the Guild simply swallow up.\"\n\"That sounds all very nice,\" said Nimloth, \"But how do we know your potion is going to work? If you make one potion, take the rest of Oediad's diamond, and leave, we won't know until you've gone whether the potion works or not.\"\n\"Ah, trust is so rare these days,\" sighed Abelle. \"I suppose I could make two potions for you, and there'd still be a little bit of the diamond left for me. Not a lot, but perhaps enough to get me to Ald Redaynia. Then you could try the first potion right here and now, and see if you're satisfied or not.\"\n\"But,\" I interjected. \"You could make one potion that works and one that doesn't, and take more of the diamond. She could even give you a slow-acting poison, and by the time she got to Ald Redaynia, you'd be dead.\"\n\"Bleedin' &lt;a href=\"Kynareth\"&gt;Kynareth&lt;/a&gt;, you &lt;a href=\"Dunmer\"&gt;Dunmer&lt;/a&gt; are suspicious! I will hardly have any diamond left, but I could make two potions of two doses each, so you can satisfy yourself that the potion works and has no negative effects. If you still don't trust me, come along with me to my table and witness my craft if you'd like.\"\nSo it was decided that I would accompany Abelle back to her table where she had all her traveling bags full of herbs and minerals, to make certain that she was not making two different potions. It took nearly an hour of preparation, but she kindly allowed me to finish her half-filled flagon of wine while I watched her work. Splintering the diamond and powdering the pieces required the bulk of the time; over and over again, she waved her gnarled hands over the gem, intoning ancient enchantments, breaking the facets of the stone into smaller and smaller pieces. Separately she made pastes of minced bittergreen, crushed red bulbs of dell'arco spae, and driblets of ciciliani oil. I finished the wine.\n\"Old woman,\" I finally said with a sigh. \"How much longer is this going to take? I'm getting tired of watching you work.\"\n\"The Mages Guild has fooled the populace into thinking alchemy is a science,\" she said. \"But if you're tired, rest your eyes.\"\nMy eyes closed, seemingly of their own volition. But there had been something in that wine. Something that made me do what she asked.\n\"I think I'll make up the potion as cakes. It's much more potent that way. Now, tell me, young man, what will your friends do once I give them the potion?\"\n\"Mug you in the street afterwards to retrieve the rest of the diamond,\" I said simply. I didn't want to tell the truth, but there it was.\n\"I thought so, but I wanted to be certain. You may open your eyes now.\"\nI opened my eyes. Abelle had made a small presentation on a wooden platter: two small cakes and a silver cutting knife.\n\"Pick up the cakes and bring them to the table,\" said Abelle. \"And don't say anything, except to agree with whatever I say.\"\nI did as I was told. It was a curious sensation. I didn't really mind being her puppet. Of course, in retrospect, I resent it, but it seemed perfectly natural at the time to obey without question.\nAbelle handed the cakes to Oediad and I dutifully verified that both cakes were made the same way. She suggested that he cut one of the cakes in half, and she would take one piece and he'd take the other, just so he would know that they worked and weren't poisoned. Oediad thought it was a good idea, and used Abelle's knife to cut the cake. Abelle took the piece on the left and popped into her mouth. Oediad took the piece on the right and swallowed it more cautiously.\nAbelle and all the bags she was carrying vanished from sight almost instantly. Nothing happened to Oediad.\n\"Why did it work for the witch and not for me?\" cried Oediad.\n\"Because the diamond dust was only on the left-hand side of the blade,\" said the old alchemist through me. I felt her control lessening as the distance grew and she hurried invisibly down the dark Ald'ruhn street away from the Rat and the Pot.\nWe never found Abelle Chriditte or the diamond. Whether she completed her pilgrimage to Ald Redaynia is anyone's guess. The cakes had no effect, except to give Oediad a bad case of droops that lasted for nearly a week."}

They trace the evolution of Vivec from a foolish mortal into an enlightened divine. Vivec sought out experiences that tested him in every way possible, particularly in the defense and protection of his &lt;a href=\"Dunmer\"&gt;Dunmer&lt;/a&gt; people, and through his long life, his humility, and his unconquerable spirit, he attained the Wisdom of the Seven Graces. The Cantatas relate many stories of Vivec's experiments with challenge and risk, his failures and triumphs, his blessings of insight and good fortune, and his debt to his partners, &lt;a href=\"Almalexia\"&gt;Almalexia&lt;/a&gt; the Lover and &lt;a href=\"Sotha%20Sil\"&gt;Sotha Sil&lt;/a&gt; the Teacher.

She's an interesting old bird, that &lt;a href=\"Hagraven%20%28Online%29\"&gt;hagraven&lt;/a&gt;. Since coming to the old &lt;a href=\"Bretons%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Breton&lt;/a&gt; fort, my job among the &lt;a href=\"Winterborn%20Clan\"&gt;Winterborn&lt;/a&gt; has been to assist Gull-koo, doing whatever the hagraven needs in order to make sure the briar hearts grow and thrive. Strange things, those briar hearts. Kind of like large fruits, but also kind of like the heart of some large animal. Or man.\nToday I got to see the process up close. It starts with a corpse. The Winterborn prefer to use the corpse of an enemy, but the hagravens have no such compunctions Any corpse will serve their purposes, whether an &lt;a href=\"Orsimer%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Orc&lt;/a&gt;, Winterborn, or even a &lt;a href=\"Harpy%20%28Online%29\"&gt;harpy&lt;/a&gt;. Once a corpse is procured, it is purified in a strange ritual of the hagraven's own devising and place in a specially prepared plot of soil. Then, with great reverence and fanfare, the hagraven adds the briar heart seed to the planted body.\nSpells and blood serve to feed and water the macabre garden, and soon the first sprouts begin to bloom from the corpse. The sprouts quickly grow into saplings, which in turn grow into small trees. These small trees connect through a system of roots back to the large tree the hagravens and tree tenders care for in one of the fort's courtyards. I believe that the sapling trees contribute to the health and overall power of the large tree, but my questions on the subject were ignored by Gull-koo and the other hagravens.\nMeanwhile, briar heart fruit blooms on the saplings and the large tree alike, beating a haunting cascade that echoes throughout the fortress. Once the fruit ripens, it is ready to be transplanted. And that's where our own warriors come into the picture. In most cases, when a Winterborn warrior falls in battle, a hagraven can bless the warrior with a ripe briar heart. The magical process plunges the briar heart into the fallen warrior and returns the warrior to life, granting him or her additional strength and fortitude as befits a briar-heart warrior.\nNow, I haven't yet been privy to the process, but I believe there's also a way to implant the briar hearts into living warriors. I've seen the cages where some of our most-powerful and loyal warriors have gone to meditate and prepare themselves for elevation to briar-heart warrior status. Perhaps, if Gull-koo agrees, they'll allow me to accept such an honor. I'll let you know how it turns out.\nYour sister, writing from Frostbreak Fortress"}

So great was the number of dead that the clans saw autumn's return twice over before all the bodies had been gathered.\nWhen they saw the number of the dead, and the fields that lay fallow with none to work them, the chiefs of clans Shar and Tuul met in secret. They said \"There is neither glory nor honor in the slaughter of our warriors. The hero that rises this season will die the next and when we are old and grey, will there be any strong &lt;a href=\"Orsimer%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Orc&lt;/a&gt; left to replace us?\"\nSo they called on &lt;a href=\"Malacath\"&gt;Malacath&lt;/a&gt; and made an offering of &lt;a href=\"echatere\"&gt;echatere&lt;/a&gt; and of their own blood. And the &lt;a href=\"Daedric%20Princes\"&gt;Prince&lt;/a&gt; answered them:\n\"Erect a monument of the dead to me, a cairn for the fallen of clans Shar and Tuul. There pick from among your number the strongest. The contenders will duel atop the cairn until it is consecrated with the blood of the loser. The victor shall be chief of a new clan, &lt;a href=\"Shatul%20Clan\"&gt;Shar-tuul&lt;/a&gt;.\"\nThe chiefs did as Malacath commanded. The war between the clans ended and a new clan was founded. The place of the first duel was called the Bloody Knoll, for it was built from the bodies of the war-slain and consecrated with the blood of the losing duelist."}

He claims to own an almost complete collection of all &lt;a href=\"Morrowind\"&gt;Morrowind&lt;/a&gt;'s worthless housewares. But he is still looking for some items to complete his collection. Thus, he sends the Nerevarine to find them for him, promising him a reward\u2014and the title of a \"Champion of Clutter.\"\nWalkthrough.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Nerevarine\"&gt;Nerevarine&lt;/a&gt;'s wanders through the &lt;a href=\"Craftsmen%27s%20Hall\"&gt;Craftsmen's Hall&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Mournhold%20%28Tribunal%29\"&gt;Mournhold&lt;/a&gt; may lead them to a man named &lt;a href=\"Detritus%20Caria\"&gt;Detritus Caria&lt;/a&gt;, a &lt;a href=\"Breton\"&gt;Breton&lt;/a&gt; Nobleman. Caria's proclaims to be the \"King of Clutter,\" and is eager to add to his collection of random, common, objects, enlisting the Nerevarine to aid him in his quest. His first task for the Nerevarine is to find two extravagantly titled items.\nThe Rarest of Ware.\nWhat becomes immediately clear to the Nerevarine is that the \"Brushed Silver Pitcher\" and \"Imperial Rat Hair Fabric\" are either incredibly rare, or fictional. However, obtaining the silver pitcher for sale in the &lt;a href=\"Pawnbroker%20%28Tribunal%29\"&gt;Pawnbroker&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;a href=\"Great%20Bazaar\"&gt;Great Bazaar&lt;/a&gt; will count as the former item. For the latter, Caria describes the Rat Hair Fabric as \"burgundy\" with a \"diamond pattern,\" uncannily similar to the ordinary rolls of red fabric frequently seen across &lt;a href=\"Mournhold%20%28Tribunal%29\"&gt;Mournhold&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Vvardenfell%20%28Morrowind%29\"&gt;Vvardenfell&lt;/a&gt;.\nBringing the silver pitcher, and any roll of red fabric will surface, with Caria rewarding the Nerevarine the title of \"Champion of Clutter\" and a prize of 300 . He also explains his next list of items required for his collection.\nDining Dreams.\nCaria's second list contains a set of objects commonly found in &lt;a href=\"Mournhold%20%28Tribunal%29\"&gt;Mournhold&lt;/a&gt;, although it may still take some time to obtain all of them. The first item is a &lt;a href=\"Redware%20Pot\"&gt;Redware Pot&lt;/a&gt; which, along with his request for a Yellow Plate, are easy enough to find in Mournhold's various shops. The rest of the items on his list requires a full set of \"Imperial Silverware,\" more specifically a knife, fork and spoon. Any silverware version of these items will do.\nWith his list complete, the Nerevarine may return to Caria to earn a 500 reward. However, the Clutter King has one more list of items to obtain before his collection can truly be completed.\nDwemer Debris.\nIn order to complete his collection, Caria announces that he requires a full set of tableware, fashioned by the long-gone &lt;a href=\"Dwemer\"&gt;Dwemer&lt;/a&gt;. Specifically, Caria requests that the Nerevarine find two goblets (of different styles), a bowl, a pitcher and a tankard. All of these items may be obtained from any Dwemer ruin, although the tankard is identified as a mug by everyone apart from Caria. Once all five items have been gathered, the Nerevarine may return to Caria.\nA jubilant Caria will greet the Nerevarine upon their return, rewarding them 2,000 for their efforts, and proclaiming them to be the 'Champion of Clutter' until the end of time."}

So one day &lt;a href=\"Boethiah\"&gt;Boethiah&lt;/a&gt;, Prince of Plots, precocious youth, tricked Trinimac to go into his mouth. Boethiah talked like Trinimac for awhile then, and gathered enough people to listen to him.

He will tell you that he and his liege &lt;a href=\"Sir%20Etienne%20Hu\"&gt;Sir Etienne Hu&lt;/a&gt; were sent here to protect the village, but that his liege has since fallen ill. He will ask for your help in fighting off the &lt;a href=\"Reachmen%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Reachmen&lt;/a&gt; here. The moment you are done talking, the village elder, &lt;a href=\"Medya%20Zurric\"&gt;Medya Zurric&lt;/a&gt;, will show up and tell Theo that Sir Etienne is being taken care of and will soon rest easily. \nTalk to Theo again and he will tell you what happened here; he and his soldiers came to the defense of the villagers, but they were slaughtered and the Reachmen managed to take over the town. He will then head off to go check on Sir Etienne, telling you to hold the line. Check the fortifications on both sides of the docks. On the eastern side, you will notice that the fortifications are on fire; grab a bucket of water and put it out. On the west side, you will be attacked by several waves of Reachmen, so you will have to fend these off.\nOnce the fortifications on both sides have been checked, head to the north side of town, to Medya Zurric's home. You will have to fight your way through a horde of Reachmen to get there. Inside, you will find Theo by the side of Sir Etienne's body. Sir Etienne seems to have been murdered with his own weapon. Theo will ask you to look around the house to see if there are any clues regarding who killed the man. Examine the body, the scene at the dining table, the wash basket on the other side of the room and the book lying by the bookshelf. You will find that Sir Etienne's wounds had been tended to, that he was dining with three people here and that someone here was reading a book containing Medya Zurric's family history. The book on her family history mentions that she survived the &lt;a href=\"Black%20Drake%27s%20Invasion\"&gt;Black Drake's Invasion&lt;/a&gt; and that she had a son.\n\"&lt;Blood is scattered in tiny droplets all over the surfaces. There are three bowls near the table. It appears as though Sir Etienne had his broken leg propped on the extra chair on his side of the table.&gt;\"\n\"&lt;The basin's interior is damp, and its edges are smudged with fresh blood stains.&gt;\"\nTake this information to Theo and he will note that it seems likely that Medya is either another victim or will know about the culprit. She is not here though; her apprentice &lt;a href=\"Rolbert%20Foucher\"&gt;Rolbert Foucher&lt;/a&gt; is down by the docks and may be able to supply more information. Speak with him there and he will tell you that Medya did indeed live through the Black Drake's Invasion, but that he has never heard of her having a son. He will also tell you that since the invasion, Medya has been something of a leader to the village, and that the reachmen have not raided here even though they have raided in other places. He will suggest looking for Medya in the homes; she might be treating people there. \nIn the abandoned house in the west of town, you will find a &lt;a href=\"The%20Reachmen%20are%20Coming%21\"&gt;note&lt;/a&gt; that mentions Medya telling someone that the Reachmen would be coming. It will mention her coming down from the river covered in blood. Head to the river and you will find an altar to &lt;a href=\"Hircine%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Hircine&lt;/a&gt; there.\n\"&lt;Scattered around this grisly totem are Hagraven feathers and spears of blood, both new and old.&gt;\"\nTake this information back to Theo at Medya's house; when you approach the house, you will hear Theo's voice saying Medya's here. Head inside and a spell will be put on Theo, making him fall to the ground. Medya's son &lt;a href=\"Labhraidh\"&gt;Labhraidh&lt;/a&gt; is here and is hostile; kill him and Theo will recover. Theo will accuse Medya of having killed Sir Etienne; speak with him and he will ask you whether Medya should be killed on the spot or whether she should get a trial. Whichever option you choose will end the quest."}

Somehow, their chief has learned how to speak intelligently, and has asked me to assist them with a number of small favors.\"\nWalkthrough.\nThis quest can be started by approaching the entrance to Thirsk Mead Hall. A &lt;a href=\"Riekling%20%28Dragonborn%29\"&gt;Riekling&lt;/a&gt; will initiate dialogue and ask the &lt;a href=\"Last%20Dragonborn\"&gt;Dragonborn&lt;/a&gt; to follow him inside. Once inside, speak to the &lt;a href=\"Riekling%20Chief\"&gt;Riekling Chief&lt;/a&gt;. The Chief has learned how to speak and explains that he has a few tasks that he needs help with.\n\"You strong. Help tribe-kin\"\nWhere did you live before you were here? \"Tribe-kin live all places. All of world within great water.\"&lt;br \\&gt;\nWhy did you take over Thirsk? \"Hot fire. Cold dizzydrink. Happy tribe.\"&lt;br \\&gt;\nWho are you? \"You. You strong. Help tribe-kin.\"&lt;br \\&gt;\nFetch Bilgemuck.\nThe first task the chief asks is to find &lt;a href=\"Bilgemuck\"&gt;Bilgemuck&lt;/a&gt;, a unique &lt;a href=\"Bristleback%20%28Dragonborn%29\"&gt;Bristleback&lt;/a&gt;, and bring him back to Thirsk. Approach the beast and offer it some meat for bait, such as &lt;a href=\"Horker%20Meat%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Horker Meat&lt;/a&gt;, and it will begin to follow the Dragonborn. Lead it to a small pen by the side of the mead hall to complete the first part of the quest.\nCollect 10 Scathecraw.\nNext he requires ten samples of &lt;a href=\"Scathecraw%20%28Dragonborn%29\"&gt;Scathecraw&lt;/a&gt;, which he calls \"redgrass\".\u00a0Scathecraw can be found all over Solstheim or bought from &lt;a href=\"Alchemists%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;alchemists&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href=\"Raven%20Rock%20%28Dragonborn%29\"&gt;Raven Rock&lt;/a&gt; has a great abundance of them.\nKill the Nords.\nFor the final task, he will ask the Dragonborn to help him\u00a0kill some nearby Nords that have been troubling the Rieklings. If &lt;a href=\"Bujold%27s%20Retreat\"&gt;Bujold's Retreat&lt;/a&gt; has been visited before, it is revealed that these Nords are actually the previous inhabitants of Thirsk Mead Hall that were driven off by the chief and his fellow Rieklings. Accepting to help the chief will cause him to jump out his throne and run outside, ready to fight. Alternately, the Dragonborn can also voice their reluctance, resulting in the chief waiting inside the hall for the Dragonborn to return later. This gives the Dragonborn the opportunity to talk to Bujold and help her instead. If the Dragonborn agrees to help &lt;a href=\"Bujold%20the%20Unworthy\"&gt;Bujold&lt;/a&gt;, \"The Chief of Thirsk Hall\" quest will fail and the Dragonborn can participate in \"Retaking Thirsk\" hall with the help of Bujold and the others.\nThe chief will exit the hall with three of his warriors and give a short pre-battle speech:\n\"Froo ha cawasy jo la.\"\"Karoo taray pelfrik?\"\"Felgir paw tuwani barj.\"\"Goora! Goora! Goora!\"\nWhat this means is unknown; however, it bolsters the spirits of the Rieklings and\u00a0they will charge at Bujold's Retreat. Approaching the camp will turn the Nords hostile and they will immediately fight back.\nTaking the throne.\nOnce all the Nords have been killed, the chief will mention that the Dragonborn is too strong and perhaps wishes to usurp him, much like he did with the previous chief of the tribe:\n\"You strong! All tribe-kin stronger with you. But... maybe you too strong. Too strong, want to be chief.\"\nSlow down here. I don't want to hurt you.&lt;br \\&gt;\nYou're right. I want to be the new chief.&lt;br \\&gt;\nNext he will attack. Once he is dead the Rieklings of Thirsk will recognize the Dragonborn as the new chief and the quest is completed.\nRewards.\nAfter completing the quest, any member of the Riekling tribe at Thirsk Mead Hall can be recruited as a &lt;a href=\"Followers%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;follower&lt;/a&gt;. Additionally, while in &lt;a href=\"Solstheim%20%28Dragonborn%29\"&gt;Solstheim&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"Skyrim\"&gt;Skyrim&lt;/a&gt;, between one and three Riekling warriors from the tribe may appear randomly to assist when in &lt;a href=\"Combat%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;combat&lt;/a&gt;. There are three types that may appear: scouts, hunters, and warriors. The Thirsk Mead Hall Rieklings are afterwards classified as \"pets\" (as with dog followers), and can be recruited in addition to a regular humanoid follower. Thirsk Mead Hall Reiklings may be fully equipped and upgraded by the player with a bow and arrows, helmet, armor, gauntlets and boots. Equipped armor will not visibly change the Riekling character model. Most Rieklings will not use melee weapons or torches. Regular rieklings and riekling warriors will equip great swords and giants club. "}

Who needs a scheming politician when one aspires to be a god?\nThe answer to his question is, of course, yes. This is why I must seize the amulet and protect it. It is the vessel through which I will supplant my would-be master and assume dominion over two worlds. Why would a god settle for just one?"}

You think you'll be able to cleave an enemy's skull if you can't split firewood?\"\n\"That's easy! I'll show you! Thredor snatched up his weapon, a battered iron cast-off from his brother's younger days, and charged the block. With a mighty yell, he closed his eyes and swung the axe over his head with all the strength he could muster, staggering forward as the blade sailed past the log and lodged itself in the dirt.\n\"Not so easy, is it? You've got some power there, but that won't help if you can't hit what you want. Here, watch me,\" Thralorr demonstrated a few chops. \"See how I keep my eyes on the target the whole time and take a solid stance? Now you try again.\"\nThey chopped wood on into the evening until Thredor's arms felt weak and his hands burned where they gripped the haft. He trained like this for many weeks, simply chopping wood, until he could chop a whole cord without a break with only one hand on the axe.\nOne morning, to his delight, he came to the yard for his daily practice only to find his brother standing next to a construction of stuffed sacks and sticks painted with the roaring lion of the &lt;a href=\"Daggerfall%20Covenant\"&gt;Daggerfall Covenant&lt;/a&gt;.\n\"You have more strength and good aim now, but let's see how you do with a different target. Come and show this filth what a Nord can do!\" He tossed his little brother a makeshift wooden shield and spent the morning calling out targets and waving the dummy's arms as Thredor hacked away while attempting to block the flimsy blows.\n\"I can't wait to try out Troll-Fang on a real one!\" Thredor breathed heavily as the two took a break in the shade of a nearby tree.\n\"Is that what you've named it, then? Well, let's hope it doesn't come to that so soon,\" replied Thralorr. \"You've learned a lot, but you've a long way to go yet. We'll keep practicing, and before you know it, you'll be ready to answer the call of battle. Wait, what's that? I think I hear it now!\"\nThredor rolled his eyes \"That's just mother calling us in,\" he protested.\n\"Her wrath is worse then any Covenant soldier!\" cried Thralorr. \"Hurry, before she comes after us!\" Laughing, he chased his brother across the yard and into the house."}

Here's what happened in town since Issue 20:\nSeems that everyone has recovered from the &lt;a href=\"New%20Life%20Festival\"&gt;New Life Festival&lt;/a&gt;, though &lt;a href=\"Verene%20Lirlane\"&gt;Verene&lt;/a&gt; continues to celebrate.\n&lt;a href=\"Darvell%20Litte\"&gt;Darvell&lt;/a&gt; is at it again. He passed out several times near the &lt;a href=\"The%20Oak%20and%20Crosier\"&gt;Oak and Crossier&lt;/a&gt; this month. He claims not to have been drinking but overcome by fumes from the ground. Darvell insists that there's something underground, something only he can sense. Fumes indeed; poor Vanny!\nThe &lt;a href=\"Quickstep%20Bandits\"&gt;Quickstep Bandits&lt;/a&gt; struck again, stealing hay and rope from &lt;a href=\"Zegol%20gro-Narzul\"&gt;Zegol's&lt;/a&gt; storehouse. That should improve Zegol's ever-sunny disposition, no?\nPrefect Doran swears she'll do something about the clamor of the merchants around &lt;a href=\"Little%20Oak%20Place\"&gt;Little Oak Place&lt;/a&gt;. The constant bickering over display space must end. Something needs to be done to cut down on the merchants in town. Porcia should have &lt;a href=\"Domitius\"&gt;Domitius&lt;/a&gt; throw out every other one.\nTHE CHORROL CRIER\nIssue 23\n&lt;a href=\"Sun%27s%20Height\"&gt;Sun's Height&lt;/a&gt;, 579\nApologies to my readers\u2014the events of the last months have prevented me from writing the Crier. But now I resume my duties.\nThe upheavals in &lt;a href=\"Chorrol%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Chorrol&lt;/a&gt;, both personal and physical, continue. The quakes never stop while the chasm grows ever wider and its list of victims longer. I can't bear to name all those we lost during the cataclysm. Every family has suffered. A walk through town highlights the missing more than the still-present.\nStill no explanation for the upheaval. Folks here call it the \"Sundering.\" Darvell insists that he smelled the chasm before Chorrol was torn asunder. He's acting even odder than before, if that's possible.\nWhen Prefect Doran was taken by a creature from the chasm, we looked to Domitius for leadership, but he refused. I have taken up the role, until someone else wants it. I sent &lt;a href=\"Ethyan%20Drenim\"&gt;Ethyan&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Larian\"&gt;Larian&lt;/a&gt; to the &lt;a href=\"Imperial%20City%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Imperial Ciy&lt;/a&gt;, to see if more is known of these events. And to request aid for our ruined town.\nTHE CHORROL CRIER\nIssue 24\n&lt;a href=\"Calendar\"&gt;Hearthfire&lt;/a&gt;, 579\nAs most know, Ethyan and Larian returned from their journey last week. None of the news was good. They didn't make it to the city. The bridges are gone and monsters roam the banks of &lt;a href=\"Lake%20Rumare\"&gt;Lake Rumare&lt;/a&gt;. Our scouts heard rumors from refugees fleeing the city. No aid is coming; the city lies in ruins.\nThe cataclysm that split Chorrol in half also devastated the Imperial City. Some say it originated there. Larian reports the city folk called it the \"&lt;a href=\"Soulburst\"&gt;Soulburst&lt;/a&gt;,\" though none knew why.\n&lt;a href=\"Varen%20Aquilarios%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Emperor Varen&lt;/a&gt; is missing. Some say he died in the upheaval, others that he was just badly injured. Maybe it was his soul that burst? The &lt;a href=\"Five%20Companions\"&gt;Five Companions&lt;/a&gt; are all missing as well. Some say that &lt;a href=\"Sai%20Sahan%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Sai Sahan&lt;/a&gt; killed the emperor and stole the &lt;a href=\"Amulet%20of%20Kings%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Amulet of Kings&lt;/a&gt;. Others claim it was &lt;a href=\"Lyris%20Titanborn%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Lyris&lt;/a&gt;. Only confusion reigns in the Imperial City now.\nAnd in Chorrol as well. &lt;a href=\"Flame%20Atronach%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Creatures of flame&lt;/a&gt; lurk in the chasm now, seizing any who venture near. Fumes from the fiery depths have caused several Chorrolians to pass out while crossing the bridge and topple to their deaths. At least the fumes and monsters have chased away the merchants who used to infest &lt;a href=\"Little%20Oak%20Place\"&gt;Little Oak Place&lt;/a&gt;. I suspect we'll miss them in the months to come though.\nTHE CHORROL CRIER\nIssue 25\n&lt;a href=\"First%20Seed\"&gt;First Seed&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"2E%20580\"&gt;580&lt;/a&gt;\nIt's been many months since my last issue. I don't seem to have the energy for it anymore. I'll try to be better.\nChorrol teeters on the edge. Quakes shake the town almost every day. Our homes fall down around us. The chasm almost feels like part of the town now. It's hard to remember what Chorrol was like without it.\nMany have left. Those who remain either have nowhere else to go or are too stubborn to give up. We're all just hanging on, waiting for we know not what.\nNowhere else is any better. They say the &lt;a href=\"House%20Tharn\"&gt;Tharns&lt;/a&gt; have seized control of the Empire, though they control little more than the city and Lake Rumare's environs. &lt;a href=\"Clivia%20Tharn\"&gt;Clivia Tharn&lt;/a&gt; is now Empress Regent; may the she-wolf choke on the title.\nArmed gangs roam the countryside, &lt;a href=\"Imperial%20Legion%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Imperial Army&lt;/a&gt; deserters gone bad. True soldiers are rarely seen, as they hide in their keeps. Rumors of war with the barbarian nations outside &lt;a href=\"Cyrodiil%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Cyrodiil&lt;/a&gt; are heard every day. They smell the Empire's weakness and look to conquer the jewel of Tamriel. The gods help us all.\nTHE CHORROL CRIER\nFinal Issue\n&lt;a href=\"Sun%27s%20Dusk\"&gt;Sun's Dusk&lt;/a&gt;, 580\nSorry, but I can't do this anymore. This is the last issue of the Crier, unless someone else takes it up.\nI keep hoping things will get better, but they only get worse. Each quake brings another piece of my house down and slides it a little closer to the chasm. I keep expecting it to fall in any day. When it does, I'll go with it. Ethyan does his best, but the house is more patches than holes now.\nArmies march past the town, sometimes right through it. Never the Imperial Army, always troops from the &lt;a href=\"Daggerfall%20Covenant\"&gt;Covenant&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"Aldmeri%20Dominion%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Dominion&lt;/a&gt;. Food is scarce, crops stolen or trampled by the invaders. We're slowly starving here.\nNo place else to go. War is everywhere. Bandits pillage at will. Travelers tell of monsters roaming the countryside. The few merchants who made it here are too scared to leave. Not that they have much to sell.\nWho can fix this? It can't be fixed. This is the way things are now, until we die. The gods have left &lt;a href=\"Cyrodiil%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Cyrodiil&lt;/a&gt;. I wish you all luck, but you won't find it."}

I was there pretending to be a scholar from &lt;a href=\"Wayrest%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Wayrest&lt;/a&gt;, but my true purpose was to watch, listen, and report back to &lt;a href=\"High%20King%20Emeric%20%28Online%29\"&gt;King Emeric&lt;/a&gt; of Wayrest about events in the &lt;a href=\"Khajiit%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Khajiit&lt;/a&gt;i homeland. It was in this capacity as a spy that I originally encountered the boisterous and charismatic &lt;a href=\"Orsimer%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Orc&lt;/a&gt; warrior. He was newly arrived from Wrothgar, busy establishing himself in the mercenary group known as &lt;a href=\"Gaspard%27s%20Stalkers\"&gt;Gaspard's Stalkers&lt;/a&gt;. From all reports, he was brave, competent, and of unmatched physical prowess. He certainly looked the part to me.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Bretons%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Breton&lt;/a&gt; mercenary leader, Gaspard Esmery, opened his ranks to any and all races. As long as you were willing to follow orders and fight with all your strength, Gaspard had a place for you in his unit. Kurog brought along a handful of powerful Orcs who also happened to be extremely loyal to the young warrior. Soon, they were the most-prominent members of the Stalkers, getting the most-dangerous missions and the ogre's share of the loot.\nI was able to get close to Kurog on a number of occasions. He enjoyed being flirted with, especially by an attentive Breton woman who enjoyed sampling Khajiiti delicacies as much as he did. During these moments when we met for food and drink, he let down his guard and told me things I'm sure he wouldn't have revealed to any of his male acquaintances. It was during one such rendezvous, in a dark and seedy tavern in the city of &lt;a href=\"Orcrest%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Orcrest&lt;/a&gt;, that I learned about the Orc warrior's past and his dreams for the future.\nWe have all heard the horrible stories of life in the Orc strongholds. Kurog told me of his younger days as part of a clan in distant &lt;a href=\"Wrothgar%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Wrothgar&lt;/a&gt;. He was the best and the brightest of a new crop of younglings\u2014stronger, faster, and in many ways more brilliant than either his contemporaries or most of his elders. But he was unsatisfied with life in the clan. He wanted to prove himself in battle. He wanted to see the world. And both he and his clan chief knew that if he remained in the stronghold much longer, one of them was going to die. That was the way of life for the Orcs.\nInstead of pushing the issue and challenging the chief, Kurog rallied his bosom companions and signed on with a recruiter for Gaspard's Stalkers mercenary company. After lending his talents to help win skirmishes across &lt;a href=\"Hammerfell%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Hammerfell&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Cyrodiil%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Cyrodiil&lt;/a&gt;, the company had made its way to Elsweyr. Kurog seemed to be having a grand old time seeing the sights, eating the food, bedding the wenches (his words, not mine), and winning battle after battle. I offered Kurog a spoonful of honey pudding, my other hand resting on his powerful arm, and asked in all innocence, \"But what about the future, my powerful friend?\"\n\"The future?\" Kurog laughed. \"I'm going to go home, kill the old chief, and take command of &lt;a href=\"Clan%20Bagrakh\"&gt;my clan&lt;/a&gt;!\"\nKurog said all this matter-of-factly. He wasn't boasting. He wasn't trying to impress me. He was simply telling me what he believed. And you know what? I believed it, too. This was definitely an Orc that King Emeric was going to want to keep an eye on, mark my words.\n&lt;a href=\"The%20Chronicles%20of%20King%20Kurog%2C%20Book%20II\"&gt;Book 2&lt;/a&gt;.\nI had the pleasure of introducing Kurog to King Emeric when the Orc mercenary visited Wayrest. He was in the company of his Orc companions. They had recently resigned their commissions in Gaspard's Stalkers mercenary company and were making their way back to the wilds of Wrothgar. Thanks to the friendship I had fostered with Kurog during our time together in Elsweyr, he contacted me in the hope of visiting with me when they arrived in Wayrest. I readily agreed and offered to play tour guide while he was in the city.\nAfter spending a few days showing Kurog around the city and introducing him to the many tastes of Breton society (Kurog certainly does love to eat!), I surprised him with a clandestine visit to Wayrest Castle. I must admit that I was slightly worried about how the meeting was going to turn out. Kurog can be loud and crass, and he knows very little of the social graces. In retrospect, I shouldn't have been concerned. King Emeric and Kurog got along smashingly! They seemed to share similar opinions about politics and warfare, and they took great pleasure in trying to make the other laugh out loud. At the end of the evening, Kurog admitted to the king that he was returning to Wrothgar to claim his rightful place as chief of his clan.\n\"Should I be worried?\" King Emeric asked with a smile.\n\"Of course you should be worried,\" Kurog laughed. \"But I like you, King Emeric. I think I will seek to rebuild Yashnag's kingdom in &lt;a href=\"Falkreath\"&gt;Falkreath&lt;/a&gt; before I turn my attention toward &lt;a href=\"High%20Rock%20%28Online%29\"&gt;High Rock&lt;/a&gt;.\"\nThe two men shook hands and a shiver ran down my spine. I had a feeling that I was witnessing something important, even if I never imagined just how monumental this moment would actually prove to be. As Kurog started to take his leave, King Emeric had one more surprise to add to the evening's already long list of amazing occurrences. \"My friend,\" Emeric said, \"I have a request. Allow Lady Zephrine to accompany you back to Wrothgar. She has been my eyes and ears in distant lands, and I certainly want to know how your ambitions play out.\"\nKurog laughed again. It was an infectious sound. \"You want me to take your spy to Wrothgar?\" Again, Kurog demonstrated he wasn't quite as thick-headed as most people believed about Orcs. I wonder how long ago he guessed as to my true nature. \"Damn it all, why not? She's amusing, she knows how to eat and drink, and she's more than pleasant to look at. Pack your bags, my lady. And bring something warm. The weather in Wrothgar can be a bit nippy.\"\nAnd with that, I accompanied Kurog to the land of the Orcs.\n&lt;a href=\"The%20Chronicles%20of%20King%20Kurog%2C%20Book%20III\"&gt;Book 3&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe journey to Wrothgar turned out to be more pleasant than I expected. Kurog continued to be a fun and exciting companion. If anything, his mood grew even lighter the closer we got to the land of his birth. Along the way, we talked of many things, including Kurog's hopes to change some of the more oppressive and restrictive traditions of his people. \"We should build great cities, cosmopolitan communities with places of learning and culture,\" Kurog said. \"And cuisine. Lots and lots of cuisine. It's so much better than food.\"\nWhen we finally crossed the border into Wrothgar, the mood among Kurog's company of Orcs turned somber and more serious. They knew the stakes of siding with Kurog against their clan chief and were prepared to deal with those consequences, but that didn't make marching toward possible doom any easier. Kurog, on the other hand, maintained a jovial, even childlike, glee. He had prepared for this moment his entire life, and he was ready to leap head-first into his destiny. I was afraid for him, but I was also honored to call him my friend. And, if I may be so bold, just watching Kurog riding tall and proud atop his horse made my heart beat a little faster. I guess I was a bit smitten with the charismatic Orc warrior.\nAt some point Kurog must have noticed that I was staring at him. He gave me a dazzling Orc smile, winked, and said, \"Once I become chief, you could be one of my wives. Consider that an open invitation.\" I turned away, hoping he didn't see how flush my face had become. I didn't know if I should laugh or scream in angry mortification at such a ludicrous idea. But by the time I gathered my thoughts and turned back to confront him, Kurog was holding up one gauntleted hand. \"From here,\" he said, \"I go on alone.\"\nChief Bolazgar waited for Kurog. Four large, hulking Orc warriors stood beside the chief, their angry gazes locked on the younger Orc. And beyond them, it seemed to me like the entire clan had come out to see what was about to occur. \"Are you going to grovel before your chief and beg my forgiveness, Kurog?\" Bolazgar sneered. \"No, not today,\" Kurog replied cheerfully. \"Today, I challenge you for leadership of the clan.\"\nEven from a distance, I could see that Chief Bolazgar was shaking with rage. \"How dare you?\" he bellowed. \"Do you think you can best me in fair combat? Do you?\"\nKurog shrugged. \"As a matter of fact, I know I can best you. You've grown fat and weak while I've been fighting wars in distant lands,\" Kurog proclaimed. \"In fact, I'm not sure there's going to be anything fair about this combat.\"\nWith a scream of pure hatred, Bolazgar drew his weapon and charged. In stark contrast, Kurog calmly unsheathed his sword and stood his ground. Then, with an economy of motion, he blocked the clan chief's initial, clumsy attack, and followed that with a single, devastating swipe. Bolazgar's head bounced three times before it came to rest against the boot of one of his honor guards.\nThe field was silent for a long moment. Then the first call went out, \"Long live Chief Kurog.\" The rest of the clan took up the chant as each member, in turn, dropped to one knee before the powerful Kurog. He smiled. \"Today begins a new day for the Orsimer!\" Kurog proclaimed. \"I will lead you to glory! On this, you have my word!\"\nAnd it was clear that I wasn't the only one who believed him.\n&lt;a href=\"The%20Chronicles%20of%20King%20Kurog%2C%20Book%20IV\"&gt;Book 4&lt;/a&gt;.\nAs the years went by, I was often used as an intermediary between King Emeric and Chief Kurog. Because of this, and due to my ongoing friendship with the chief, I was privy to many of the most significant events in Kurog's life. And not only to the events, but also to Kurog's thoughts and feelings, because he continued to trust me and utilize me as a confidant, even writing to me when we were in different parts of the continent. (But, sadly, no. I never took him up on his offer to become one of his wives. Kurog began to collect wives early in his chiefdom, not unlike a stable master collects horses. But that's a tale for another day.)\nKurog spent a few years consolidating his power, growing his clan and forming alliances with clan chiefs that were willing to support his goals and ideals. It was about this time that Kurog revealed the details of his grand vision. \"I will follow in the footsteps of mighty Yashnag and march into &lt;a href=\"Skyrim%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Skyrim&lt;/a&gt;,\" he wrote to me. \"I will restore the Orcish kingdom in Falkreath and create an Orcish city to rival the wondrous Wayrest.\" While Kurog was busy to the north, King Emeric was dealing with issues in central High Rock. &lt;a href=\"King%20Ranser\"&gt;King Ranser&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"Shornhelm%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Shornhelm&lt;/a&gt; had declared war against Wayrest. After a clandestine meeting with the king, I decided I had to make one more trip to stand at Kurog's side.\nI caught up with Kurog near &lt;a href=\"Dragonstar%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Dragonstar&lt;/a&gt;, as his forces were accumulating in the mountains of western Skyrim. They were having a more difficult time of it than Kurog had anticipated. The &lt;a href=\"Nords%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Nords&lt;/a&gt;, wracked as they were by civil war, nonetheless proved to be capable and courageous fighters. The path to Falkreath was long and arduous, and the rock and snow were going to be bathed in the blood of warriors from both sides before this campaign was done. I sat with Kurog one night, watching the roaring fire, when the clan chief opened up as he did during our times together back in Elsweyr.\n\"These damn Nords,\" Kurog said, \"if they had a shred of decency they'd put down their weapons and get out of our way. But no. The clans that aren't fighting us are trying to bribe us to aid their cause. They don't see us as conquerors. They think we're mercenaries! I'm beginning to think that my Falkreath dream is going to be crushed by all this snow and ice. Damn the Nords and damn their foul mead!\"\nI placed a hand on Kurog's knee and said softly, \"What if I offered you a different, better dream? And the authority to make that dream a reality?\" Kurog looked at me for a long time. Then he stood, towering over me, and demanded to know what I was talking about. Instead, I reached into my traveling cloak, withdrew a leather document pouch, and handed it to him. He read the contents by the light of the fire. Read it again. And a third time. Then he asked me if this was some sort of trick. I assured him that it wasn't a trick. It was an offer. \"You help King Emeric, and King Emeric helps you,\" I said, and the two of us talked long into the deepening night.\nIn the morning, Kurog had a list of demands for me to take back to Wayrest. I was impressed. He was driving a hard bargain, but he was also offering King Emeric the power necessary to end &lt;a href=\"Ranser%27s%20War\"&gt;Ranser's War&lt;/a&gt; in one fell stroke. I told him I would get the documents to King Emeric as quickly as possible. In return, he promised that his army would be ready and waiting for Emeric's signal\u2014but they would not make a move until the signed documents were in Kurog's hands.\nAnd that was how the Orcs joined the &lt;a href=\"Daggerfall%20Covenant\"&gt;Daggerfall Covenant&lt;/a&gt; and Kurog became the King of Wrothgar.\n&lt;a href=\"The%20Chronicles%20of%20King%20Kurog%2C%20Book%20V\"&gt;Book 5&lt;/a&gt;.\nLet's talk about the wives of King Kurog of Wrothgar. He began collecting wives shortly after he returned to Wrothgar and defeated Bolazgar to become chief of his clan. His first selections were purely political, taking wives to shore up his alliances with other clans. It was about this time that I became aware of Kurog's mother, &lt;a href=\"Alga\"&gt;Alga&lt;/a&gt;. He had mentioned her a few times in conversations we had over the years, but she never seemed to be a major influence in his life. At least, she wasn't prominent in his life as a mercenary.\nNow that Kurog was chief of his clan, his mother had stepped in to fill a need he never knew he had. She took the title of Grand Forge-Mother and immediately set out to negotiate marriages for her son. For those of you not intimately familiar with Orc traditions, you must understand that the only male in a clan allowed to take wives is the chief. He functions sort of like the primary male in a pride of lions, lording over all until someone younger and stronger comes along to take his crown. Just as Kurog did with Bolazgar. The chief's wives become the highest-ranking people in the stronghold, taking charge of important clan functions while the chief supervises everything from a distance. The only activity the chief personally takes charge of is war, whether leading raids or actually taking his clan into battle against a hated enemy.\nThe most-influential and powerful of the chief's wives is the hunt-wife, and this was the first marriage that Alga worked to secure. Rumors abound that more than a dozen young hopefuls were vying for the position, but Alga and Kurog had a specific goal in mind. In the end, a powerful daughter from the &lt;a href=\"Shatul%20clan\"&gt;Shatul clan&lt;/a&gt;, famed hunters of the Wrothgar highlands, was selected to solidify the alliance between the clans. Noroga pledged her loyalty, taking her place as Kurog's hunt-wife.\nWhen it came time to find Kurog a forge-wife to oversee blacksmithing and mining for the clan, Alga looked no further than the famed weapon and armor smiths of the &lt;a href=\"Morkul%20clan\"&gt;Morkul clan&lt;/a&gt;. The obvious choice was the Morkul chief's eldest daughter, an Orc maiden named Ashaka. But Alga was more interested in the younger &lt;a href=\"Tugha\"&gt;Tugha&lt;/a&gt;, who had traveled abroad for two years to study with the blacksmiths of western Skyrim. Her experiences, modern attitudes, and obvious intelligence won her the position of forge-wife for Kurog and his clan.\nIf there was a requirement other than bringing another powerful clan under Kurog's banner, the role of hearth-wife demanded not only a brilliant household administrator but a talent for cooking that went beyond the usual skills of a mountain-bear hash-slinger. Kurog, as I've mentioned in previous volumes of this chronicle, relished food with a passion. Between fighting and eating, I'd be hard-pressed to determine which activity Kurog enjoyed more. Be that as it may, it would take years to find someone of Orcish grace and exceptional talent to fill this marital role. A great competition was eventually staged while Kurog was off aiding King Emeric at the end of Ranser's War.\nWhile Kurog was away, at least according to my sources, Forge-Mother Alga invited the most eligible Orc maidens from the most powerful clans not yet allied with Kurog to compete for the title of hearth-wife. She made them engage in a culinary battle that was as violent and bloody as any skirmish Kurog himself had ever undertaken. The women had to track, kill, and clean their own ingredients. They had to fight each other to secure spices from distant lands. And then they had to present their finished meals before time ran out. Alga and Kurog's first wives, Noroga and Tugha, would judge the worth of each contestant's offering. Barazal of &lt;a href=\"Clan%20Murtag\"&gt;Clan Murtag&lt;/a&gt; won the day, as much for her physical strength (it is said she killed a mountain bear with her bare hands) as her deft use of delicate spices.\nKurog has many and varied lesser wives, most of who I have no real knowledge of, as they work behind the scenes and rarely made their presence known. Two, however, are always at Kurog's side. These are his protectors, the shield-wives. Two powerful fighters currently fill these roles in Kurog's household, the warrior-sisters Oshgatha and Razbela. The sisters are as loyal to each other as they are to the king, ready to lay down their lives to defend him should the need arise. Even Noroga and Tugha remain on best behavior when the shield-wives are present.\nNote: Though each marriage secured Kurog a certain degree of cooperation from the various clans, I should point out that since Kurog took the title of king, some of the clan chiefs who joined with Kurog by virtue of his marriage to their daughters have had a change of heart. While these chiefs won't openly oppose Kurog due to the marriage alliance, they have yet to publicly accept him as king of the Orcs. This, as you can probably guess, makes Kurog extremely unhappy.\n&lt;a href=\"The%20Chronicles%20of%20King%20Kurog%2C%20Book%20VI\"&gt;Book 6&lt;/a&gt;.\nNow I want to take a few pages to record King Kurog's grand vision for Wrothgar and the Orc nation. I listened to his plan develop over the years from a nebulous dream, to a kernel of an idea, to the strategy that now inspires the re-building of Orsinium.\nDuring one of our first rendezvous, Kurog imbibed an astonishing amount of moon-sugar double rum. This had the effect of making him both introspective and extremely talkative. With a few smiles, a well-placed giggle, and an occasional compliment or question, I was able to get Kurog to open up about a great many things. But as the evening wore on, he began to tell me about his dream for the Orsimer\u2014his name for the people we call Orcs.\n\"The strongholds,\" Kurog said. \"They've served the Orsimer well for generations. But our traditions, for all they aid and guide us, they also hold us back. They mire us in outdated notions and meaningless restrictions.\" There was more, of course. While he understood the need for violence and was extremely good at it, he hated that everything in the strongholds was solved by beating or killing someone or another. \"It makes it very hard to have a civil discourse on anything of substance,\" he bemoaned, \"because sooner or later someone reaches for something heavy or sharp to use to punctuate their particular point of view. Something needs to change.\"\nThe next time the subject came up, we were drinking treacle tea and watching the sun set over the &lt;a href=\"Tenmar%20Forest\"&gt;Tenmar Forest&lt;/a&gt;. It was obvious that Kurog had given the topic much thought since we had last discussed it. In addition to just making life better for the Orsimer, now he also wanted to elevate his people on the political level as well. \"The other kingdoms will never take us seriously as long as we remain trapped in our old traditions,\" he said, a trace of bitterness evident in his voice. \"We must develop a modern society if we are ever to stand shoulder to shoulder with the other races as equals. We need to build Orsimer towns and cities that can sustain diplomacy and trade while not looking like ancient and restrictive fortresses. A little fear in your contemporaries is all well and good. I find that it helps immensely in negotiations. But attitudes and mannerisms that invoke terror? Those should be locked away and reserved for your enemies, not left on constant display to frighten friends and foes alike.\"\nIt was my final day in Elsweyr. I was preparing to return to Wayrest after what I assumed was going to be my last extended stay in the Khajiiti countryside, when Kurog invited me to join him for dinner. He had reserved a private room at the local inn and paid the establishment's chef to prepare a farewell feast for the two of us to share. As we munched on dried sugarmeat and caramelized sweetcakes, Kurog picked up his ongoing narrative of how he was going to return home and help his people. \"I plan to rebuild our past glory, perhaps by reestablishing Yashnag's ancient Orsimer kingdom in Falkreath or maybe even raising the ruins of Orsinium itself.\"\nKurog's dream had become goal, a challenge he had placed upon himself to test his mettle and his strength of spirit. It would begin with Kurog's return to Wrothgar to wrest the chiefdom of his clan from the \"insolent leader\" (his words, not mine) who banished him. Then he would gather other clan leaders to his banner, forming a nation of independent states that was large enough and powerful enough to carve a kingdom for the Orcs\u2014a kingdom that would see Kurog as its king. \"Tell Emeric that the next time we meet, it will be as equals or it will be as enemies!\" Kurog said. \"Under my rule, Orsimer will have every right and opportunity afforded to the citizens of Wayrest or &lt;a href=\"Windhelm%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Windhelm&lt;/a&gt;. The old ways will fall away, and a new age will dawn for the Orsimer people. This I so pledge!\"\nI won't deny it. Kurog's words, his passion, they moved me. I wanted to believe that he would succeed, that the Orcs would rise up and prosper under his benign rule. I would never forget what he described to me. Later, when King Emeric was in desperate need of allies, I would remember Kurog and whisper into Emeric's ear. And that is how alliances are born."}

It is part of \"&lt;a href=\"The%20Chronicles%20of%20King%20Kurog\"&gt;The Chronicles of King Kurog&lt;/a&gt;\".\nContents.\nI first met &lt;a href=\"Kurog%20gro-Bagrakh\"&gt;Kurog gro-Bagrakh&lt;/a&gt; in the wilds of &lt;a href=\"Elsweyr%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Elsweyr&lt;/a&gt;. I was there pretending to be a scholar from &lt;a href=\"Wayrest%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Wayrest&lt;/a&gt;, but my true purpose was to watch, listen, and report back to King &lt;a href=\"High%20King%20Emeric%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Emeric&lt;/a&gt; of Wayrest about events in the &lt;a href=\"Khajiit%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Khajiiti&lt;/a&gt; homeland. It was in this capacity as a spy that I originally encountered the boisterous and charismatic &lt;a href=\"Orsimer%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Orc&lt;/a&gt; warrior. He was newly arrived from Wrothgar, busy establishing himself in the mercenary group known as &lt;a href=\"Gaspard%27s%20Stalkers\"&gt;Gaspard's Stalkers&lt;/a&gt;. From all reports, he was brave, competent, and of unmatched physical prowess. He certainly looked the part to me.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Bretons%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Breton&lt;/a&gt; mercenary leader, &lt;a href=\"Gaspard%20Esmery\"&gt;Gaspard Esmery&lt;/a&gt;, opened his ranks to any and all races. As long as you were willing to follow orders and fight with all your strength, Gaspard had a place for you in his unit. Kurog brought along a handful of powerful Orcs who also happened to be extremely loyal to the young warrior. Soon, they were the most-prominent members of the Stalkers, getting the most-dangerous missions and the ogre's share of the loot.\nI was able to get close to Kurog on a number of occasions. He enjoyed being flirted with, especially by an attentive Breton woman who enjoyed sampling Khajiiti delicacies as much as he did. During these moments when we met for food and drink, he let down his guard and told me things I'm sure he wouldn't have revealed to any of his male acquaintances. It was during one such rendezvous, in a dark and seedy tavern in the city of &lt;a href=\"Orcrest%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Orcrest&lt;/a&gt;, that I learned about the Orc warrior's past and his dreams for the future.\nWe have all heard the horrible stories of life in the Orc strongholds. Kurog told me of his younger days as part of a clan in distant Wrothgar. He was the best and the brightest of a new crop of younglings\u2014stronger, faster, and in many ways more brilliant than either his contemporaries or most of his elders. But he was unsatisfied with life in the clan. He wanted to prove himself in battle. He wanted to see the world. And both he and his clan chief knew that if he remained in the stronghold much longer, one of them was going to die. That was the way of life for the Orcs.\nInstead of pushing the issue and challenging the chief, Kurog rallied his bosom companions and signed on with a recruiter for Gaspard's Stalkers mercenary company. After lending his talents to help win skirmishes across &lt;a href=\"Hammerfell%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Hammerfell&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Cyrodiil%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Cyrodiil&lt;/a&gt;, the company had made its way to Elsweyr. Kurog seemed to be having a grand old time seeing the sights, eating the food, bedding the wenches (his words, not mine), and winning battle after battle. I offered Kurog a spoonful of honey pudding, my other hand resting on his powerful arm, and asked in all innocence, \"But what about the future, my powerful friend?\"\n\"The future?\" Kurog laughed. \"I'm going to go home, kill the old chief, and take command of my clan!\"\nKurog said all this matter-of-factly. He wasn't boasting. He wasn't trying to impress me. He was simply telling me what he believed. And you know what? I believed it, too. This was definitely an Orc that King Emeric was going to want to keep an eye on, mark my words."}

He was in the company of his Orc companions. They had recently resigned their commissions in &lt;a href=\"Gaspard%27s%20Stalkers\"&gt;Gaspard's Stalkers&lt;/a&gt; mercenary company and were making their way back to the wilds of &lt;a href=\"Wrothgar%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Wrothgar&lt;/a&gt;. Thanks to the friendship I had fostered with Kurog during our time together in &lt;a href=\"Elsweyr%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Elsweyr&lt;/a&gt;, he contacted me in the hope of visiting with me when they arrived in Wayrest. I readily agreed and offered to play tour guide while he was in the city.\nAfter spending a few days showing Kurog around the city and introducing him to the many tastes of Breton society (Kurog certainly does love to eat!), I surprised him with a clandestine visit to &lt;a href=\"Castle%20Wayrest%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Wayrest Castle&lt;/a&gt;. I must admit that I was slightly worried about how the meeting was going to turn out. Kurog can be loud and crass, and he knows very little of the social graces. In retrospect, I shouldn't have been concerned. King Emeric and Kurog got along smashingly! They seemed to share similar opinions about politics and warfare, and they took great pleasure in trying to make the other laugh out loud. At the end of the evening, Kurog admitted to the king that he was returning to Wrothgar to claim his rightful place as chief of his clan.\n\"Should I be worried?\" King Emeric asked with a smile.\n\"Of course you should be worried,\" Kurog laughed. \"But I like you, King Emeric. I think I will seek to rebuild &lt;a href=\"Yashnag\"&gt;Yashnag&lt;/a&gt;'s kingdom in &lt;a href=\"Falkreath\"&gt;Falkreath&lt;/a&gt; before I turn my attention toward &lt;a href=\"High%20Rock%20%28Online%29\"&gt;High Rock&lt;/a&gt;.\"\nThe two men shook hands and a shiver ran down my spine. I had a feeling that I was witnessing something important, even if I never imagined just how monumental this moment would actually prove to be. As Kurog started to take his leave, King Emeric had one more surprise to add to the evening's already long list of amazing occurrences. \"My friend,\" Emeric said, \"I have a request. Allow &lt;a href=\"Zephrine%20Frey\"&gt;Lady Zephrine&lt;/a&gt; to accompany you back to Wrothgar. She has been my eyes and ears in distant lands, and I certainly want to know how your ambitions play out.\"\nKurog laughed again. It was an infectious sound. \"You want me to take your spy to Wrothgar?\" Again, Kurog demonstrated he wasn't quite as thick-headed as most people believed about Orcs. I wonder how long ago he guessed as to my true nature. \"Damn it all, why not? She's amusing, she knows how to eat and drink, and she's more than pleasant to look at. Pack your bags, my lady. And bring something warm. The weather in Wrothgar can be a bit nippy.\"\nAnd with that, I accompanied Kurog to the land of the Orcs."}

If anything, his mood grew even lighter the closer we got to the land of his birth. Along the way, we talked of many things, including Kurog's hopes to change some of the more oppressive and restrictive traditions of his people. \"We should build great cities, cosmopolitan communities with places of learning and culture,\" Kurog said. \"And cuisine. Lots and lots of cuisine. It's so much better than food.\"\nWhen we finally crossed the border into Wrothgar, the mood among Kurog's company of &lt;a href=\"Orsimer%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Orcs&lt;/a&gt; turned somber and more serious. They knew the stakes of siding with Kurog against their clan chief and were prepared to deal with those consequences, but that didn't make marching toward possible doom any easier. Kurog, on the other hand, maintained a jovial, even childlike, glee. He had prepared for this moment his entire life, and he was ready to leap head-first into his destiny. I was afraid for him, but I was also honored to call him my friend. And, if I may be so bold, just watching Kurog riding tall and proud atop his horse made my heart beat a little faster. I guess I was a bit smitten with the charismatic Orc warrior.\nAt some point Kurog must have noticed that I was staring at him. He gave me a dazzling Orc smile, winked, and said, \"Once I become chief, you could be one of my wives. Consider that an open invitation.\" I turned away, hoping he didn't see how flush my face had become. I didn't know if I should laugh or scream in angry mortification at such a ludicrous idea. But by the time I gathered my thoughts and turned back to confront him, Kurog was holding up one gauntleted hand. \"From here,\" he said, \"I go on alone.\"\n&lt;a href=\"Chief%20Bolazgar\"&gt;Chief Bolazgar&lt;/a&gt; waited for Kurog. Four large, hulking Orc warriors stand beside the chief, their angry gazes locked on the younger Orc. And beyond them, it seemed to me like the entire clan had come out to see what was about to occur. \"Are you going to grovel before your chief and beg my forgiveness, Kurog?\" Bolazgar sneered. \"No, not today,\" Kurog replied cheerfully. \"Today, I challenge you for leadership of the clan.\"\nEven from a distance, I could see that Chief Bolazgar was shaking with rage. \"How dare you?\" he bellowed. \"Do you think you can best me in fair combat? Do you?\"\nKurog shrugged. \"As a matter of fact, I know I can best you. You've grown fat and weak while I've been fighting wars in distant lands,\" Kurog proclaimed. \"In fact, I'm not sure there's going to be anything fair about this combat.\"\nWith a scream of pure hatred, Bolazgar drew his weapon and charged. In stark contrast, Kurog calmly unsheathed his sword and stood his ground. Then, with an economy of motion, he blocked the clan chief's initial, clumsy attack, and followed that with a single, devastating swipe. Bolazgar's head bounced three times before it came to rest against the boot of one of his honor guards.\nThe field was silent for a long moment. Then the first call went out, \"Long live Chief Kurog.\" The rest of the clan took up the chant as each member, in turn, dropped to one knee before the powerful Kurog. He smiled. \"Today begins a new day for the &lt;a href=\"Orsimer%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Orsimer&lt;/a&gt;!\" Kurog proclaimed. \"I will lead you to glory! On this, you have my word!\"\nAnd it was clear that I wasn't the only one who believed him."}

It is part of \"&lt;a href=\"The%20Chronicles%20of%20King%20Kurog\"&gt;The Chronicles of King Kurog&lt;/a&gt;\".\nContents.\nAs the years went by, I was often used as an intermediary between &lt;a href=\"High%20King%20Emeric%20%28Online%29\"&gt;King Emeric&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Chief%20Kurog\"&gt;Chief Kurog&lt;/a&gt;. Because of this, and due to my ongoing friendship with the chief, I was privy to many of the most significant events in Kurog's life. And not only to the events, but also to Kurog's thoughts and feelings, because he continued to trust me and utilize me as a confidant, even writing to me when we were in different parts of the continent. (But, sadly, no. I never took him up on his offer to become one of his wives. Indeed, Kurog didn't take a wife at all until later in his chiefdom, but that's a tale for another day.)\nKurog spent a few years consolidating his power, growing his clan and forming alliances with clan chiefs that were willing to support his goals and ideals. It was about this time that Kurog revealed the details of his grand vision. \"I will follow in the footsteps of mighty &lt;a href=\"Yashnag\"&gt;Yashnag&lt;/a&gt; and march into &lt;a href=\"Skyrim%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Skyrim&lt;/a&gt;,\" he wrote to me. \"I will restore the &lt;a href=\"Orsimer%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Orcish&lt;/a&gt; kingdom in &lt;a href=\"Falkreath\"&gt;Falkreath&lt;/a&gt; and create an Orcish city to rival the wondrous &lt;a href=\"Wayrest%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Wayrest&lt;/a&gt;.\" While Kurog was busy to the north, King Emeric was dealing with issues in central &lt;a href=\"High%20Rock%20%28Online%29\"&gt;High Rock&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href=\"King%20Ranser\"&gt;King Ranser&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"Shornhelm%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Shornhelm&lt;/a&gt; had declared war against Wayrest. After a clandestine meeting with the king, I decided I had to make one more trip to stand at Kurog's side.\nI caught up with Kurog near &lt;a href=\"Dragonstar%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Dragonstar&lt;/a&gt;, as his forces were accumulating in the mountains of western Skyrim. They were having a more difficult time of it than Kurog had anticipated. The &lt;a href=\"Nords%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Nords&lt;/a&gt;, wracked as they were by civil war, nonetheless proved to be capable and courageous fighters. The path to Falkreath was long and arduous, and the rock and snow were going to be bathed in the blood of warriors from both sides before this campaign was done. I sat with Kurog one night, watching the roaring fire, when the clan chief opened up as he did during our times together back in &lt;a href=\"Elsweyr%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Elsweyr&lt;/a&gt;.\n\"These damn Nords,\" Kurog said, \"if they had a shred of decency they'd put down their weapons and get out of our way. But no. The clans that aren't fighting us are trying to bribe us to aid their cause. They don't see us as conquerors. They think we're mercenaries! I'm beginning to think that my Falkreath dream is going to be crushed by all this snow and ice. Damn the Nords and damn their foul &lt;a href=\"mead\"&gt;mead&lt;/a&gt;!\"\nI placed a hand on Kurog's knee and said softly, \"What if I offered you a different, better dream? And the authority to make that dream a reality?\" Kurog looked at me for a long time. Then he stood, towering over me, and demanded to know what I was talking about. Instead, I reached into my traveling cloak, withdrew a leather document pouch, and handed it to him. He read the contents by the light of the fire. Read it again. And a third time. Then he asked me if this was some sort of trick. I assured him that it wasn't a trick. It was an offer. \"You help King Emeric, and King Emeric helps you,\" I said, and the two of us talked long into the deepening night.\nIn the morning, Kurog had a list of demands for me to take back to Wayrest. I was impressed. He was driving a hard bargain, but he was also offering King Emeric the power necessary to end &lt;a href=\"Ranser%27s%20War\"&gt;Ranser's War&lt;/a&gt; in one fell stroke. I told him I would get the documents to King Emeric as quickly as possible. In return, he promised that his army would be ready and waiting for Emeric's signal\u2014but they would not make a move until the signed documents were in Kurog's hands.\nAnd that was how the Orcs joined the &lt;a href=\"Daggerfall%20Covenant\"&gt;Daggerfall Covenant&lt;/a&gt; and Kurog became the King of &lt;a href=\"Wrothgar%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Wrothgar&lt;/a&gt;."}
{"id": "876303", "revid": "5064773", "url": "https://elderscrolls.fandom.com/wiki?curid=876303", "title": "The Chronicles of King Kurog, Book V", "text": "The Chronicles of King Kurog, Book V is a &lt;a href=\"Books%20%28Orsinium%29\"&gt;book&lt;/a&gt; in . It is part of \"&lt;a href=\"The%20Chronicles%20of%20King%20Kurog\"&gt;The Chronicles of King Kurog&lt;/a&gt;\".\nContents.\nLet's talk about the wives of &lt;a href=\"King%20Kurog\"&gt;King Kurog&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"Wrothgar%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Wrothgar&lt;/a&gt;. He began collecting wives shortly after he returned to Wrothgar and defeated &lt;a href=\"Bolazgar\"&gt;Bolazgar&lt;/a&gt; to become chief of his clan. His first selections were purely political, taking wives to shore up his alliances with other clans. It was about this time that I became aware of Kurog's mother, &lt;a href=\"Alga\"&gt;Alga&lt;/a&gt;. He had mentioned her a few times in conversations we had over the years, but she never seemed to be a major influence in his life. At least, she wasn't prominent in his life as a mercenary.\nNow that Kurog was chief of his clan, his mother had stepped in to fill a need he never knew he had. She took the title of Grand Forge-Mother and immediately set out to negotiate marriages for her son. For those of you not intimately familiar with Orc traditions, you must understand that the only male in a clan allowed to take wives is the chief. He functions sort of like the primary male in a pride of lions, lording over all until someone younger and stronger comes along to take his crown. Just as Kurog did with Bolazgar. The chief's wives become the highest-ranking people in the village, taking charge of important clan functions while the chief supervises everything from a distance. The only activity the chief personally takes charge of is war, whether leading raids or actually taking his clan into battle against a hated enemy.\nThe most-influential and powerful of the chief's wives is the hunt-wife, and this was the first marriage that Alga worked to secure. Rumors abound that more than a dozen young hopefuls were vying for the position, but Alga and Kurog had a specific goal in mind. In the end, a powerful daughter from the &lt;a href=\"Shatul%20clan\"&gt;Shatul clan&lt;/a&gt;, famed hunters of the Wrothgar highlands, was selected to solidify the alliance between the clans. &lt;a href=\"Noroga\"&gt;Noroga&lt;/a&gt; pledged her loyalty and the loyalty of her clan, taking her place as Kurog's hunt-wife.\nWhen it came time to find Kurog a forge-wife to oversee blacksmithing and mining for the clan, Alga looked no further than the famed weapon and armor smiths of the &lt;a href=\"Morkul%20clan\"&gt;Morkul clan&lt;/a&gt;. The obvious choice was the Morkul chief's eldest daughter, a powerful Orc maiden named &lt;a href=\"Grugha\"&gt;Grugha&lt;/a&gt;. But Alga was more interested in the younger &lt;a href=\"Forge-Wife%20Tugha\"&gt;Tugha&lt;/a&gt;, who had traveled abroad for two years to study with the blacksmiths of western &lt;a href=\"Skyrim%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Skyrim&lt;/a&gt;. Her experiences, modern attitudes, and obvious intelligence won her the position of forge-wife for Kurog and his clan.\nIf there was a requirement other than bringing another powerful clan under Kurog's banner, the role of hearth-wife demanded not only a brilliant household administrator but a talent for cooking that went beyond the usual skills of a mountain-bear hash-slinger. Kurog, as I've mentioned in previous volumes of this chronicle, relished food with a passion. Between fighting and eating, I'd be hard-pressed to determine which activity Kurog enjoyed more. Be that as it may, it would take years to find someone of Orcish grace and exceptional talent to fill this marital role. A great competition was eventually staged while Kurog was off aiding King &lt;a href=\"High%20King%20Emeric%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Emeric&lt;/a&gt; at the end of &lt;a href=\"Ranser%27s%20War\"&gt;Ranser's War&lt;/a&gt;.\nWhile Kurog was away, at least according to my sources, Grand Forge-Mother Alga invited the most eligible Orc maidens from the most powerful clans not yet allied with Kurog to compete for the title of hearth-wife. She made them engage in a culinary battle that was as violent and bloody as any skirmish Kurog himself had ever undertaken. The women had to track, kill, and clean their own ingredients. They had to fight each other to secure spices from distant lands. And then they had to present their finished meals before time ran out. Alga and Kurog's first wives, Noroga and Tugha, would judge the worth of each contestant's offering. &lt;a href=\"Bumzal\"&gt;Bumzal&lt;/a&gt; won the day, as much for her physical strength (it is said she killed a mountain bear with her bare hands) as her deft use of delicate spices.\nKurog has many and varied lesser wives, most of who I have no real knowledge of, as they work behind the scenes and rarely make their presence known. Two, however, are always at Kurog's side. These are his protectors, the shield-wives. Two powerful fighters currently fill these roles in Kurog's household, the warrior-sisters &lt;a href=\"Oshgatha\"&gt;Oshgatha&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Razbela\"&gt;Razbela&lt;/a&gt;. The sisters are as loyal to each other as they are to the king, ready to lay down their lives to defend him should the need arise. Even Noroga and Tugha remain on best behavior when the shield-wives are present."}

It is part of \"&lt;a href=\"The%20Chronicles%20of%20King%20Kurog\"&gt;The Chronicles of King Kurog&lt;/a&gt;\".\nContents.\nNow I want to take a few pages to record &lt;a href=\"King%20Kurog\"&gt;King Kurog&lt;/a&gt;'s grand vision for &lt;a href=\"Wrothgar%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Wrothgar&lt;/a&gt; and the Orc nation. I listened to his plan develop over the years from a nebulous dream, to a kernel of an idea, to the strategy that now inspires the re-building of &lt;a href=\"Orsinium%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Orsinium&lt;/a&gt;.\nDuring one of our first rendezvous, Kurog imbibed an astonishing amount of &lt;a href=\"Moon%20Sugar%20%28Online%29\"&gt;moon-sugar&lt;/a&gt; double rum. This had the effect of making him both introspective and extremely talkative. With a few smiles, a well-placed giggle, and an occasional compliment or question, I was able to get Kurog to open up about a great many things. But as the evening wore on, he began to tell me about his dream for the &lt;a href=\"Orsimer%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Orsimer&lt;/a&gt;\u2014his name for the people we call Orcs.\n\"The strongholds,\" Kurog said. \"They've served the Orsimer well for generations. But our traditions, for all they aid and guide us, they also hold us back. They mire us in outdated notions and meaningless restrictions.\" There was more, of course. While he understood the need for violence and was extremely good at it, he hated that everything in the strongholds was solved by beating or killing someone or another. \"It makes it very hard to have a civil discourse on anything of substance,\" he bemoaned, \"because sooner or later someone reaches for something heavy or sharp to use to punctuate their particular point of view. Something needs to change.\"\nThe next time the subject came up, we were drinking treacle tea and watching the sun set over the &lt;a href=\"Tenmar%20Forest\"&gt;Tenmar Forest&lt;/a&gt;. It was obvious that Kurog had given the topic much thought since we had last discussed it. In addition to just making life better for the Orsimer, now he also wanted to elevate his people on the political level as well. \"The other kingdoms will never take us seriously as long as we remain trapped in our old traditions,\" he said, a trace of bitterness evident in his voice. \"We must develop a modern society if we are ever to stand shoulder to shoulder with the other races as equals. We need to build Orsimer towns and cities that can sustain diplomacy and trade while not looking like ancient and restrictive fortresses. A little fear in your contemporaries is all well and good. I find that it helps immensely in negotiations. But attitudes and mannerisms that invoke terror? Those should be locked away and reserved for your enemies, not left on constant display to frighten friends and foes alike.\"\nIt was my final day in &lt;a href=\"Elsweyr%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Elsweyr&lt;/a&gt;. I was preparing to return to &lt;a href=\"Wayrest%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Wayrest&lt;/a&gt; after what I assumed was going to be my last extended stay in the Khajiiti countryside, when Kurog invited me to join him for dinner. He had reserved a private room at the local inn and paid the establishment's chef to prepare a farewell feast for the two of us to share. As we munched on dried sugarmeat and caramelized sweetcakes, Kurog picked up his ongoing narrative of how he was going to return home and help his people. \"I plan to rebuild our past glory, perhaps by reestablishing &lt;a href=\"Yashnag\"&gt;Yashnag&lt;/a&gt;'s ancient Orsimer kingdom in &lt;a href=\"Falkreath\"&gt;Falkreath&lt;/a&gt; or maybe even raising the ruins of Orsinium itself.\"\nKurog's dream had become goal, a challenge he had placed upon himself to test his mettle and his strength of spirit. It would begin with Kurog's return to &lt;a href=\"Wrothgar%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Wrothgar&lt;/a&gt; to wrest the chiefdom of his clan from the \"insolent leader\" (his words, not mine) who banished him. Then he would gather other clan leaders to his banner, forming a nation of independent states that was large enough and powerful enough to carve a kingdom for the Orcs\u2014a kingdom that would see Kurog as its king. \"Tell &lt;a href=\"High%20King%20Emeric%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Emeric&lt;/a&gt; that the next time we meet, it will be as equals or it will be as enemies!\" Kurog said. \"Under my rule, Orsimer will have every right and opportunity afforded to the citizens of Wayrest or &lt;a href=\"Windhelm%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Windhelm&lt;/a&gt;. The old ways will fall away, and a new age will dawn for the Orsimer people. This I so pledge!\"\nI won't deny it. Kurog's words, his passion, they moved me. I wanted to believe that he would succeed, that the Orcs would rise up and prosper under his benign rule. I would never forget what he described to me. Later, when King Emeric was in desperate need of allies, I would remember Kurog and whisper into Emeric's ear. And that is how alliances are born."}

You will notice that while the streets were pretty much empty before, they are now filled with dremora. Head for the fighters guild and undo the ward, then head inside and speak with king Dynar about the next step of the plan. He will tell you that the fighters guild will fight the dremora here as a distraction while you head to the upper part of the city and activate the portal in the mages guild, allowing the mages to strike from there in a two-pronged attack. \nHead to the northwest. As you are on your way, Lyranth will appear again. She will inform you that you will need a key to enter the labyrinth below Molag Bal's lair and find the Planar Vortex. She will tell you to meet you to meet her at the pyramid after you help the mages enter the city, so that she can help you take down the Valkynaz that guards this key. \nHead to the upper part of town by using the stairs in the north. The gate to that part of town is guarded by several dremora, so take care. The portal stones needed to activate the portal in the mages guild are scattered throughout the area. One of them is in the cart you see to the southwest when you enter the area. From there, head south into the ruins of the chapel to find the second stone. A third one is in the forge southwest of the chapel. Finally, head directly north to find the last one by the door to the mages guildhall. Once you have all of them, head into the guildhall and place the stones in the sockets on the floor to open the portal. \nVanus Galerion will appear out of the portal. He will tell you that the fighters and mages guilds can now handle taking the city, and will send you to go deal with the Valkynaz that Lyranth mentioned, who is located in the Pyramid in the northern part of the citadel. The entrance to this pyramid is to the north, up the stairs. You will find it blocked by a ward, but Lyranth will be standing next to it. Talk to her and she will tell you that you need her help to get in; only dremora can enter normally, and for a mortal to enter, it requires the freely given blood of a dremora. \nAfter Lyranth opens the door, you can enter the pyramid. &lt;a href=\"Valkynaz%20Seris\"&gt;Valkynaz Seris&lt;/a&gt; will appear and attack you, but several allies including &lt;a href=\"Cadwell\"&gt;Cadwell&lt;/a&gt; will appear to help you. Once he is dead, Lyranth will appear; she is now in charge of the dremora here. She will assure you that you are safe here for the time being, while there is confusion about the change in leadership, but promises nothing for the future. Either way, take the key from the chest that has also appeared, then head outside and north to speak with Vanus Galerion and finish the quest. "}

It is large and inhabited by many hostile creatures. In one of the furthest sections of the citadel, the Facility Cavern, &lt;a href=\"Dagoth%20Ur%20%28Character%29\"&gt;Dagoth Ur&lt;/a&gt; will be waiting for the Nerevarine.\nAfter seemingly defeating him, Ur disappears and a, previously blocked, door opens, also revealing the &lt;a href=\"Heart%20Ring\"&gt;Heart Ring&lt;/a&gt; lying on the floor by the door.\nAkulakhan's Chamber.\nBehind the door lies a very large cavern with the inanimate giant Akulakhan standing in the center, the &lt;a href=\"Heart%20of%20Lorkhan\"&gt;Heart of Lorkhan&lt;/a&gt; can be seen attached to its stomach. The Nerevarine must strike the heart with Sunder once, then hit it with Keening until it is destroyed. Confronting Dagoth Ur directly can prove very challenging, as his health is very high, as is his health &lt;a href=\"Regenerate%20%28Morrowind%29\"&gt;regeneration&lt;/a&gt;. The Nerevarine can either &lt;a href=\"Levitate%20%28Morrowind%29\"&gt;levitate&lt;/a&gt;, or follow the ledge that goes around the cavern to a lower level, where there is a bridge to reach the heart. Once the heart is destroyed, and the Nerevarine reaches the ledge on the way out, the giant will fall, broken into pieces and Dagoth Ur follows, falling to his death. Once Dagoth Ur is defeated, the Nerevarine must leave the way they came. The door to the previous area is blocked, but a crank not far will open it. Once back in the Facility Cavern, &lt;a href=\"Azura\"&gt;Azura&lt;/a&gt;, in the form of a &lt;a href=\"Azura%27s%20Spirit\"&gt;Spirit&lt;/a&gt;, will appear and tell the Hero that they \"\"achieved their destiny and are free. The prophecies are fulfilled, and the Blight is gone\".\" She will give the Nerevarine the &lt;a href=\"Enchant%20%28Morrowind%29\"&gt;enchanted&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Ring%20of%20Azura\"&gt;Ring of Azura&lt;/a&gt;."}

There's no end of trouble in the City of Stone, and that means plenty of ways for you to earn your supper. Your sellsword instincts should point you towards the wealthiest patrons with the fattest purses to work for, but you need to mind yourself during your resting hours.\nMarkarth isn't like your &lt;a href=\"Whiterun%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Whiterun&lt;/a&gt;, where mercenary companies like &lt;a href=\"the%20Companions\"&gt;the Companions&lt;/a&gt; make a sellsword an honored professional. No, Markarth has its own rules, rules the natives aren't going to just tell you. Lucky for you, old Ms. Alleia is here to shine the torchlight over your thick skulls.\nFirst thing you'll notice in the City of Stone is... the stone. They say &lt;a href=\"Dwemer\"&gt;dwarves&lt;/a&gt; cut out the city from the mountain, and maybe they did by the look of it. But what it really means is that the whole place is vertical, and the streets are really cliffs. Long story short, be careful when you've got a bellyful of mead.\nWhen you enter the city proper, you'll immediately hit the market. The merchants usually sell food and jewelry on the streets. Meat is the preferred ration, the craggy rocks in the area make for poor farming land, and silver is what's used to make most all the rings and necklaces you might buy, thanks to the large silver mine in the city (we'll get to that in a bit).\nWhatever you do, don't ask the Markarth city guard about anything. They're about as helpful as an angry &lt;a href=\"Frostbite%20Spider%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Frostbite Spider&lt;/a&gt; while you're caught in its web, and if you mention anything about the &lt;a href=\"Forsworn\"&gt;Forsworn&lt;/a&gt; to them they might spit in your eye. Speaking of the Forsworn, these wildmen and women will be your main source of income while you're in Markarth. The Jarl almost always has a bounty on some Forsworn leader or another, and if you don't mind going blade-to-axe with someone two septims short of a pint of ale, it's steady work.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Silver-Blood%20Inn\"&gt;Silver-Blood Inn&lt;/a&gt; is where you want to head into after seeing the market. The drinks are, as usual, watered down (and judging by the metallic taste, with water from the rivers that run through the city's smelter district). What's important here is getting a room to stay in. You won't find any friendly faces to con your way into a cheap place to stay in Markarth. The natives don't trust strangers, so save yourself the trouble and put down your coin to rent a real room.\nAfter you've spent a day recovering from travel, you'll see that Markarth is divided in two sides by the big crag in the center. The part with the big river running through it is called the Riverside, and the other is called the Dryside. The Riverside is where the smelter and native workers live, so don't bother going there. Instead, head directly to Dryside and talk to the local Nord nobles and see what problems you can start solving (at the highest rate).\nTwo major places to see are the &lt;a href=\"Temple%20of%20Dibella\"&gt;Temple of Dibella&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Cidhna%20Mine\"&gt;Cidhna Mine&lt;/a&gt;. The temple rests on the top of the central crag. A good place to go if you're on good terms with the Divines, but be warned, the Priestesses of Dibella don't allow men into their Inner Sanctums, so don't go crashing down in there uninvited unless you want a short trip to a long fall.\nCidha Mine is the place where all the silver comes from that I mentioned before. But it's also the jail. Markarth uses prisoners to mine the ore, and there's a lot of it, so don't get caught doing something illegal in the city or you'll be hauled down there to dig. Apparently, the whole place is owned by one of the big families in the city, the Silver-Bloods (notice the inn is named after them? Always keep your sellsword eye open for hints like that). I tired meeting with the head of the Silver-Blood family to see if they had any work, but guarding their mines isn't the blood-rush I became a mercenary for. Something to keep in mind for yourself if you're thinking of staying a few months.\nThe final place I'll talk about here is the &lt;a href=\"Understone%20Keep%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Understone Keep&lt;/a&gt;, the home of the Jarl in Markarth. It's a fancy palace like any other (assuming your palace is built underground), but what you need to know is the city underneath the keep. That's right, there's another city below Markarth. One of those old dwarven ruins. They sometimes have expeditions in the ruins that makes for a good job, guarding the scholars and maybe lifting a few stones here and there. If you're lucky, you might come across one of those old dwarven machines, and you can bring back a souvenir after you're done breaking it apart.\nAll right, Ms. Alleia's hand is getting tired and that means this guide is done. Last piece of advice, don't cause trouble in Markarth. Don't start fights. Don't stop fights. Don't stick your head anywhere without someone from the city paying you for it, because believe me, no one in Markarth wants you there. Make your gold, drink your mead, see what's there to see, and move on. Nothing changes in the City of Stone, and that's just fine."}

There are few places where Ms. Alleia would tell you that \"tradition\" and the \"old ways\" makes for a better fighter, but with Orcs it seems like staying true to your ancestors is the path to victory.\nLet me start a few steps back. The Orc Strongholds have existed as long as the Orc race has, according to them. They're armored camps in the least, and fortresses at the most. Every man, woman, and child inside the walls is trained from birth to defend it. All their weapons and armor are smithed right there in the stronghold, all the food is hunted down by Orc warriors and brought back to be eaten by everyone who lives there.\nThey follow no laws, save their own, an unwritten set of rules called \"The Code of &lt;a href=\"Malacath\"&gt;Malacath&lt;/a&gt;,\" named after one of their gods, who is sometimes called Mauloch. Most of its pretty simple, don't steal, don't kill, don't attack people for no reason (although there seems to be a big list of exceptions). But Orcs in the stronghold don't have jails for their criminals. They have Blood Price. You either pay enough in goods for your crimes, or you bleed enough that the victim is satisfied. And Orcs, I don't need to tell you, have a lot of blood.\nThe Code also sets up who runs the stronghold. The toughest male is usually the Chief and makes decisions and decides when the Code of Malacath has been satisfied. All the women are either the Chief's wives or his daughters, with the exception of the wise woman, who handles all the spiritual matters and healing needs. Matters of grave dispute are handled with short but violent fights, and those who don't get along with the Chief are usually forced out of the stronghold to live among the rest of us. An Orc grows up being told to fight for everything, that if something is not worth fighting for it is beneath the Code.\nOrc Strongholds don't like strangers, used to living on their own like they do. Ms. Alleia knows what she does because so many Orcs leave the strongholds to become sellswords or soldiers, and a few pints of mead gets them talking about home. I hear that sometimes an Orc will make a non-Orc a \"Blood-Kin\" and that person is then allowed to live in the stronghold as one of the clan, but I've never heard of that actually happening.\nFor all their strange rules and traditions, the Code of Malacath does breed a culture of determined warriors. They're focused in ways that the average sellsword isn't. They don't hesitate to draw weapons and settle matters openly, and I think that's the real difference between the stronghold Orcs and the city Orcs. &lt;a href=\"Imperial%20Law\"&gt;Imperial Law&lt;/a&gt; allows you to settle fights through the &lt;a href=\"Imperial%20Legion\"&gt;Emperor's men&lt;/a&gt;, but the Code of Malacath demands you settle your problems yourself, a fine way of thinking if you're leading the mercenary's life."}

He tasks the Hero with relighting the Great Torch, which has gone out since the Greymarch began. They must go to &lt;a href=\"Cylarne\"&gt;Cylarne&lt;/a&gt; to get the Flame of Agnon in order to relight the torch.

This walkthrough is based on the deception angle - telling the Dark Seducers they are on their side while secretly leading the Golden Saints through a forgotten passage to surprise the Seducers. Remember, though, that there are other ways of accomplishing this mission.\"\nCylarne.\n&lt;a href=\"Cylarne\"&gt;Cylarne&lt;/a&gt; is in far northwest &lt;a href=\"Mania\"&gt;Mania&lt;/a&gt;, on &lt;a href=\"The%20Isle%20of%20Flame\"&gt;The Isle of Flame&lt;/a&gt;. Once the Hero arrives speak to &lt;a href=\"Vika%20%28Shivering%20Isles%29\"&gt;Vika&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"Dark%20Seducer%20%28Shivering%20Isles%29\"&gt;Dark Seducer&lt;/a&gt; guard. Tell her they are working for Sheogorath, and she will give a key for Cylarne. Vika will also detail the level of animosity between the Seducers and the &lt;a href=\"Golden%20Saint%20%28Shivering%20Isles%29\"&gt;Golden Saints&lt;/a&gt;. She says that the only way to kindle the flame is to activate both the Altar of Rapture and Despair. Each side controls one Altar, and both sides are about to go to war to gain control of both Altars. Vika will send them to &lt;a href=\"Ulfri\"&gt;Ulfri&lt;/a&gt;, the Dark Seducer commander.\nWalk through Cylarne, there will be no enemies until seeing Ulfri. She will find them shortly and explain that the Dark Seducers are preparing to ambush the Golden Saints, who are moments away from attacking. Tell her one would like to speak to the leader of the Saints (though just simply join her in the fight against the Saints).\nProceed through Cylarne, past the Altar of Despair, and into the Underdeep. Use caution - the Underdeep is trapped in several places. At the end, they will find an exit door. The Golden Saints are talking on the other side. &lt;a href=\"Mirel\"&gt;Mirel&lt;/a&gt; is trying to convince &lt;a href=\"Kaneh\"&gt;Kaneh&lt;/a&gt; to scout the area before the attack. She rebuffs him, however. Talk to her and tell her to use the Underpass. She will need assurance it is not a trap, but will eventually follow them.\nGo back to the Underpass. They may have to go back outside to fetch Kaneh, but she will eventually join. Soon there will be a large battle between the Saints and Seducers. If waiting and watching the Saints will eventually be slaughtered, and the Seducers will attack the Hero. However, if joining the fight from the start, many of the Saints will live through the battle.\nAfter killing Vika, speak to Kaneh. She will say that she has been granted a great honor: to sacrifice herself in order to relight the Flame of Agnon. After the conversation, Kaneh will walk onto the Altar of Despair and burst into fire, thus relighting the Flame.\nGo outside and on the far side of the main courtyard a great fire is burning. Walk into the fire and you will be granted the Flame of Agnon. This will look like they are on fire, but it causes no damage.

It seems that whatever the Khajiit choose to do, they do it with gusto. But if I told you that the flair of the silk draped streets of &lt;a href=\"Senchal%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Senchal&lt;/a&gt; couldn't hold a candle to a tiny village in the hills of &lt;a href=\"Tenmar%20Forest\"&gt;Tenmar Forest&lt;/a&gt;, would you believe it?

The pigments made in their so-called \"Colorworks\" are sought all over &lt;a href=\"Tamriel\"&gt;Tamriel&lt;/a&gt; for their vibrance in paint and dyes. These alone provide the town with enough wealth to allow such indulgence in the arts for so small a population.\nThe Khajiit of Black Heights have been refining their techniques for generations and their works are influenced by traditions carried on since the founding of the settlement. One of the oldest and most prominently displayed is a stone painting. Black Heights itself is nestled into the base of a mountain range and dotted with great stone boulders. Khajiit, particularly at a young age, are shown to paint with their paws upon the stones. Creating vast and colorful images out of hundreds of tiny paw prints. The greatest example of this is a fixture known as the Wall of Life, where every member of the village goes to add their leaves to the tree before they pass on. The scale of this bittersweet landmark left me speechless and it will do the same for you, if you hazard to venture out from the safety of Senchal and take in all the wonders &lt;a href=\"Southern%20Elsweyr\"&gt;Pellitine&lt;/a&gt; has to offer."}

I've been tapped to help retake the city alongside a Khajiiti resistance force.\"\nWalkthrough.\nUpon completing \"&lt;a href=\"Hallowed%20to%20Arenthia\"&gt;Hallowed to Arenthia&lt;/a&gt;,\" Cariel will tell you that the city has been overrun by Colovians, and that she is tasked by the Queen to aid the resistance. She will tell you to put on the uniform of the deceased soldier in front of her, and then meet her at the safehouse in the market. Before that though, you should listen to the propaganda illusion in the market. \nThe propaganda illusion will say something about wanting to be equals, but that they are committed and will not be going anywhere. After listening to it, head to the market and into the inconspicuous house north of the Mages Guild. There, speak with a woman named Kazirra, and she will tell you that the leader of the Colovians is in league with the &lt;a href=\"Stonefire%20Cult\"&gt;Stonefire Cult&lt;/a&gt;, an organization linked to the &lt;a href=\"Order%20of%20the%20Black%20Worm%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Worm Cult&lt;/a&gt;. She plans to get the Colovians' second in command to confess to this, so that their troops will desert. To this end, she will send you to search the tower district in the south of town for his schedule. \nThe first piece of evidence will be in &lt;a href=\"Zabibi%27s%20House\"&gt;Zabibi's House&lt;/a&gt;; you will find a letter titled \"&lt;a href=\"Await%20My%20Emissary\"&gt;Await My Emissary&lt;/a&gt;\" on the desk. It will detail a future meeting between &lt;a href=\"Centurion%20Gavo\"&gt;Centurion Gavo&lt;/a&gt; and an emissary of &lt;a href=\"Javad%20Tharn\"&gt;Javad Tharn&lt;/a&gt;.

Finally, head over to &lt;a href=\"Hirraxim%27s%20House\"&gt;Hirraxim's House&lt;/a&gt; for the final two pieces of information: on the ground floor, you will find \"&lt;a href=\"The%20Key%20to%20Projection\"&gt;The Key to Projection&lt;/a&gt;\" on the desk; it details how the projections work. In the coffer next to it, you will find the crystal needed to make the projections. Once you have everything, meet up with Cariel behind the tower in the south. \nCariel will tell you the next part of the plan. You are to pretend you are Tharn's envoy that Gavo is supposed to be meeting here in the tower; head inside and wait for Gavo. Once he arrives, talk to him to keep him occupied while Cariel sneaks up behind him and knocks him out. Talk to Cariel hereafter and she will tell you what to do next. You are to sneak Garo right out of the main gates while you are disguised as him and he is made to look like your prisoner. For this, she will give you a magic earring that &lt;a href=\"Razum-dar%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Razum-dar&lt;/a&gt; used to disguise himself in the past. She will then wake up Garo and instruct him to follow along lest she kill him. \nUse the earring, then bring Gavo back to the safe house and speak with Kazirra. She will tell you that the intent is to get Gavo to confess his connections to the Stonefire Cult, and project these confessions all around town using the crystal you found. The honor of using the crystal is yours; use it on Gavo and the others will make him confess that the Stonefire Cult are operating from behind the Temple and are planning to open a Dark Anchor. Speak with Kazirra hereafter and she will tell you to take the crystal to change what the illusions are saying. Head out to any of the illusions and use the crystal; it will change them all. \nOnce this is done, head to &lt;a href=\"The%20Pious%20Arenthi-Inn\"&gt;The Pious Arenthi-Inn&lt;/a&gt; in the east of town; you will be interrupting a meeting between &lt;a href=\"General%20Lavinia\"&gt;General Lavinia&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Akkhuz-ri\"&gt;Akkhuz-ri&lt;/a&gt;. The Mane will head off immediately; kill general Lavinia, then head back out. The resistance soldiers will have captured a Colovian soldier just outside; you can talk to him, and he will tell you he no longer wishes anything to do with this Daedric plot. You can either spare him or kill him. Either way, head to the center of town and speak with Cariel to finish the quest and start the next one, \"&lt;a href=\"Stonefire%20Machinations\"&gt;Stonefire Machinations&lt;/a&gt;.\""}

One article describes a list of individuals who died under suspicious circumstances when their interests conflicted with those of 'a former prince of the West'. The reference is clearly King Helseth, King of &lt;a href=\"Morrowind\"&gt;Morrowind&lt;/a&gt;, formerly Prince Helseth of the kingdom of &lt;a href=\"Wayrest\"&gt;Wayrest&lt;/a&gt; in the province of &lt;a href=\"High%20Rock\"&gt;High Rock&lt;/a&gt;.]\nTHE COMMON TONGUE\n\"A poet can have no higher purpose than to tell the truth about the human condition.\" -- &lt;a href=\"Lord%20Vivec\"&gt;Lord Vivec&lt;/a&gt;\nI have a little list. They never would be missed.\nAppearing at the top -- three names... Anhar, &lt;a href=\"Khajiit%20%28Morrowind%29\"&gt;Khajiit&lt;/a&gt; male -- Martyrius Arruntius, &lt;a href=\"Imperials%20%28Morrowind%29\"&gt;Imperial&lt;/a&gt; male -- Jusole Asciele, &lt;a href=\"Bretons%20%28Morrowind%29\"&gt;Breton&lt;/a&gt; male. What do these three names have in common?\nAll three at one time or another represented an inconvenience to a Western noble prince named Helseth.\nAnhar was an agent for Eastern &lt;a href=\"Raw%20Ebony\"&gt;ebony&lt;/a&gt; merchants. There was an unfortunate scandal concerning improper contracts offered to Helseth as compensation for his assistance in obtaining ebony import remits from the Imperial Board of &lt;a href=\"Census%20and%20Excise\"&gt;Census and Excise&lt;/a&gt;. Luckily for Prince Helseth, this scandal blew over when no one could be found to testify. Is it just a coincidence that Anhar's health went into a steep decline, just as he was to testify before the Imperial magistrates? He died a natural death, according to the Imperial coroners. Convenient and timely, perhaps, but natural.\nMartyrius Arruntius was a city alderman of Wayrest. Prince Helseth's liaison with the alderman's married daughter was potentially embarrassing to the Prince -- especially when Martyrius Arruntius forcefully pressed his suit for 'predatory adultery' in Wayrest's courts. Many thought it strange that Martyrius Arruntius should suddenly fall ill and die of 'exhaustion' on the eve of the trial. The suit was settled out of court, and charges dismissed. The Imperial coroners ruled that Martyrius Arruntius had died a natural death. Convenient and timely, admittedly, but natural.\nJusole Asciele was a diplomatic attache at the High Rock embassy in Wayrest. Widely rumored to be an intelligence officer, Jusole Asciele was often seen at court, taking a great interest in the affairs of &lt;a href=\"Barenziah%20%28Tribunal%29\"&gt;Queen Barenziah&lt;/a&gt; and her family. It is said that Wayrest can be a beastly uncomfortable place in high summer. Perhaps the Breton's constitution was ill-suited to the relentless heat and pestilential swarms of the southern &lt;a href=\"Iliac%20Bay\"&gt;Iliac&lt;/a&gt;. Jusole Asciele took suddenly ill one evening, and within three days he was dead. Once again, Imperial coroners ruled that Jusole Asciele had died a natural death. Convenient and timely, yes, but natural.\nAnd these, The Common Tongue notes significantly, are only the 'A's on the list.\nSome have quietly suggested that Prince Helseth was the most accomplished and subtle poisoner in the West. But The Common Tongue has never seen a single scrap of evidence that would prove such an indictment. [Admittedly, the absence of such proof could count as qualifying towards the title of a 'most accomplished and subtle poisoner'.]\nAnd, further, The Common Tongue does not wish to suggest that King Helseth is a poisoner, or that the recent death of &lt;a href=\"Athyn%20Llethan\"&gt;King Athyn Llethan's&lt;/a&gt; was a poisoning, and not a natural death. The Common Tongue has never seen a single scrap of evidence that would prove such an indictment. And the Imperial coroners have ruled that Athyn Llethan died a natural death."}

It serves a similar function to the &lt;a href=\"Fighters%20Guild\"&gt;Fighters Guild&lt;/a&gt; chapters of other regions of &lt;a href=\"Tamriel\"&gt;Tamriel&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href=\"Eorlund%20Gray-Mane\"&gt;Eorlund Gray-Mane&lt;/a&gt;, a &lt;a href=\"Blacksmiths%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;blacksmith&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Whiterun%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Whiterun&lt;/a&gt;, states that they have been leaderless since &lt;a href=\"Ysgramor\"&gt;Ysgramor&lt;/a&gt;.

The fact that they have no official leader is emphasized by their name.\nIf &lt;a href=\"Torvar\"&gt;Torvar&lt;/a&gt; is asked, \"Who's in charge around here?\" before joining, he will reply, \"In charge of what? I'm in charge of me, and you're in charge of you.\"\n&lt;a href=\"Jorrvaskr\"&gt;Jorrvaskr&lt;/a&gt;, the mead hall where the Companions live and operate, is the oldest building in &lt;a href=\"Whiterun%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Whiterun&lt;/a&gt;.\nBackground.\nThe Companions can trace their origins from the &lt;a href=\"Five%20Hundred%20Companions\"&gt;Five Hundred Companions&lt;/a&gt; which the legendary army &lt;a href=\"Ysgramor\"&gt;Ysgramor&lt;/a&gt; raised to wage war against the &lt;a href=\"Snow%20Elf\"&gt;snow elves&lt;/a&gt; and avenge the &lt;a href=\"Night%20of%20Tears\"&gt;Night of Tears&lt;/a&gt;. After defeating the snow elves in the &lt;a href=\"Nordic-Falmer%20War\"&gt;Nordic-Falmer War&lt;/a&gt;, the remnants of the Five Hundred Companions went their separate ways to inhabit the unexplored lands of &lt;a href=\"Tamriel\"&gt;Tamriel&lt;/a&gt;. This period of exploration and colonization is known as &lt;a href=\"The%20Return\"&gt;The Return&lt;/a&gt;.\nSeveral hundred years after the death of Ysgramor, the Companions had converted into soldiers for hire. Their services could be purchased for the fighting of wars, but the commitment to individual honor meant that often &lt;a href=\"Shield-Brother\"&gt;Shield-Brother&lt;/a&gt;s would be forced to face each other on the field of battle. Since the conflict of interests between its members was jeopardizing their bonds of honor, &lt;a href=\"Harbinger%20%28Rank%29\"&gt;Harbinger&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Mryfwiil%20the%20Withdrawn\"&gt;Mryfwiil&lt;/a&gt;, in his wisdom, decreed that they would no longer be party to any war or political conflict of any kind. Because of his steady hand, the Companions today are known as impartial arbiters of honor, in addition to their glories on the field of battle.\nBy the end of the &lt;a href=\"First%20Era\"&gt;First Era&lt;/a&gt;, the Companions have begun to do away with rigid rules of &lt;a href=\"Atmoran\"&gt;Atmoran&lt;/a&gt; racial purity and recruited people of different races and walks of life to fill their ranks. After the dark periods in the late &lt;a href=\"Second%20Era\"&gt;Second Era&lt;/a&gt;, when a string of false and dishonorable Harbingers laid claim to &lt;a href=\"Jorrvaskr\"&gt;Jorrvaskr&lt;/a&gt;, it was &lt;a href=\"Kyrnil%20Long-Nose\"&gt;Kyrnil Long-Nose&lt;/a&gt; who gathered the true hearts of the Companions in the wilds and stormed Jorrvaskr itself, killing the usurpers and returning honor through blood, in the old ways. He began the tradition of trusted advisors called &lt;a href=\"the%20Circle\"&gt;the Circle&lt;/a&gt; (named after Ysgramor's council of captains) who would serve as examples to the younger, newer Companions.\nFirst interactions.\n&lt;a href=\"Aela%20the%20Huntress%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Aela the Huntress&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Farkas\"&gt;Farkas&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Ria\"&gt;Ria&lt;/a&gt;\u00a0can be the first &lt;a href=\"Factions%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;faction&lt;/a&gt;\u00a0members to be encountered\u00a0in &lt;a href=\"Skyrim\"&gt;Skyrim&lt;/a&gt;. They first appear at &lt;a href=\"Pelagia%20Farm\"&gt;Pelagia Farm&lt;/a&gt; outside of &lt;a href=\"Whiterun%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Whiterun&lt;/a&gt; fighting a &lt;a href=\"Giant%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;giant&lt;/a&gt;. They may be assisted, and if this is done, Aela and the others react positively, while not helping causes her to deliver chastisement. Whether they are assisted or not, Aela extends an invitation to &lt;a href=\"Jorrvaskr\"&gt;Jorrvaskr&lt;/a&gt;. If Whiterun is approached using a different route, it is possible to completely miss this fight.\nBecause the Companions can kill the giant very quickly, it may be tough to get to the fight in time to assist. Shooting at the giant from afar with a bow and scoring some hits will still register as assistance, and the Companions will stay until Aela speaks with the &lt;a href=\"Last%20Dragonborn\"&gt;Dragonborn&lt;/a&gt;.\nAssistance.\nAfter joining the Companions, if the law is broken in &lt;a href=\"Whiterun%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Whiterun&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Hold%20Guard\"&gt;guards&lt;/a&gt; react negatively, members of the Companions will leap to the Dragonborn's defense.\nJorrvaskr.\n&lt;a href=\"Jorrvaskr\"&gt;Jorrvaskr&lt;/a&gt; is the home of the Companions and is located on the eastern side of Whiterun in the Wind District. Jorrvaskr sits at the base of the &lt;a href=\"Skyforge%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Skyforge&lt;/a&gt;, which is an ancient forge from which special weapons and armor are crafted by &lt;a href=\"Eorlund%20Gray-Mane\"&gt;Eorlund Gray-Mane&lt;/a&gt;. The Skyforge creates the finest steel in &lt;a href=\"Tamriel\"&gt;Tamriel&lt;/a&gt;, which is why Jorrvaskr was erected in this location. The inside serves as both the Companions' lodging and mead hall where they sleep, tell tales of valor, and occasionally fight each other. Once the Companions are joined, this hall can serve as a home for the Dragonborn as well.\nOn the southern wall of the mead hall is a special area created to hold the fragments of &lt;a href=\"Wuuthrad\"&gt;Wuuthrad&lt;/a&gt;. At the end of the Companions questline, the last fragments are collected, and Wuuthrad is reforged to become whole.\u00a0Wuuthrad can be kept after the final quest.\nJoining the Companions.\nThe most straightforward way to join the Companions is by simply heading to Jorrvaskr in Whiterun and talking to the members until directed to the Harbinger, &lt;a href=\"Kodlak%20Whitemane\"&gt;Kodlak Whitemane&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href=\"Vilkas\"&gt;Vilkas&lt;/a&gt; opposes the new member, but Kodlak reassures him and directs him to go outside and provide training. The Dragonborn must use melee weapons (or bare fists) when fighting Vilkas, and the weapon(s) cannot be enchanted. After the training, Vilkas will send the Dragonborn on an errand to Eorlund Gray-Mane, Whiterun's senior blacksmith at the Skyforge, in order to sharpen a sword. Eorlund offers information about the history of the Companions. He asks the Dragonborn to take a &lt;a href=\"Aela%27s%20Shield\"&gt;shield&lt;/a&gt; back to &lt;a href=\"Aela%20the%20Huntress%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Aela&lt;/a&gt;. After these errand quests are completed, at least one radiant quest is given before being initiated into the guild. After the brief initiation ceremony, the new member is directed to choose a bed in the living quarters, which comes with a secure dresser for storing items.\nThe Circle.\nThe Companions also have a secret. All members of the Circle are &lt;a href=\"Werewolf%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;werewolves&lt;/a&gt; and, as such, the guild is in constant conflict with a band of werewolf hunters known as the &lt;a href=\"Silver%20Hand\"&gt;Silver Hand&lt;/a&gt;. During an early Companion quest, \"&lt;a href=\"Proving%20Honor\"&gt;Proving Honor&lt;/a&gt;,\" an attack on &lt;a href=\"Farkas\"&gt;Farkas&lt;/a&gt; by the Silver Hand can be witnessed from within a locked room. After this, \"What is it like being a werewolf?\" can be asked of them.\nAfter completing more quests after the Proving Honor quest for the Companions, &lt;a href=\"Skjor\"&gt;Skjor&lt;/a&gt; can be spoken to. He and Aela offer &lt;a href=\"Lycanthropy%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;lycanthropy&lt;/a&gt;. If the Dragonborn agrees, a special ceremony is conducted allowing for the transformation into a werewolf to occur once per day. Further interaction with the Companions halts until a decision is made.\nQuests.\nSide quests.\nInitial wave.\nThese quests are available after completing \"&lt;a href=\"Take%20Up%20Arms\"&gt;Take Up Arms&lt;/a&gt;.\"\nSecond wave.\nThese quests are available after completing \"&lt;a href=\"The%20Silver%20Hand\"&gt;The Silver Hand&lt;/a&gt;.\"\nAela only offers two of these quests; the two that the Dragonborn will be asked to do is chosen by the game at random.\nAfter two of the three above quests have been completed, and upon talking with Aela to ask for work, she will direct the Dragonborn to Kodlak Whitemane, which starts the quest, \"&lt;a href=\"Blood%27s%20Honor\"&gt;Blood's Honor&lt;/a&gt;.\"\nFinal wave.\nThese quests are available after completing \"&lt;a href=\"Glory%20of%20the%20Dead\"&gt;Glory of the Dead&lt;/a&gt;.\"\nMembers.\nAsking Aela, Farkas, Vilkas, Athis or Njada to be a &lt;a href=\"Followers%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;follower&lt;/a&gt; allows for free &lt;a href=\"Trainers%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;training&lt;/a&gt; sessions, because gold spent on lessons can be removed from their &lt;a href=\"inventory\"&gt;inventory&lt;/a&gt; repeatedly. Members of the guild can be fed upon by a &lt;a href=\"Vampirism%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;vampire&lt;/a&gt;, but this is still considered a &lt;a href=\"Bounty%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;crime&lt;/a&gt;.\nBounty.\nThe way that the Companions' bounty system works is different from the normal bounty system. The only way that bounty can be received is by stealing things from other Companions (through &lt;a href=\"pickpocket\"&gt;pickpocket&lt;/a&gt;ing or just taking things from the shelves of Jorrvaskr) or by killing a Companion in a single hit. It is possible to attack any one of the Companions without incurring any bounty. A warning is issued upon the first strike, \"Watch it there, Brother/Sister.\" Thus, the &lt;a href=\"Sneak%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Sneak&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"One-Handed%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;One-Handed&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Archery%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Archery&lt;/a&gt; skills, as with any other offensive skill, can be leveled repeatedly. Killing a Companion causes a bounty of 1,000 to be assessed."}

The Companions joined the &lt;a href=\"Ebonheart%20Pact\"&gt;Pact&lt;/a&gt; military in defending the town, however the attack was a feint: the Reachmen used the diversion to assault Fallowstone Hall. Only a few junior Companions were left there, and the Hall fell swiftly. &lt;a href=\"Vigrod%20Wraithbane\"&gt;Vigrod Wraithbane&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"Vestige\"&gt;Vestige&lt;/a&gt;, and the remaining Companions attacked the Hall and drove off the invaders, but not before they stole the axe &lt;a href=\"Wuuthrad\"&gt;Wuuthrad&lt;/a&gt;.\nAfterwards the Companions joined Pact forces as they pursued the Reachmen throughout the Rift. They were eventually cornered at Vernim Wood, but it was discovered that the Reachmen were being controlled by the &lt;a href=\"Order%20of%20the%20Black%20Worm%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Worm Cult&lt;/a&gt;. The Vestige was able to slay the remaining Reachmen and their leader Stral Blackthroat, but not before the Worm Cult obtained Wuuthrad from their Reachmen servants. The Worm Cult shattered Wuuthrad and used it to revive &lt;a href=\"Sinmur\"&gt;Sinmur&lt;/a&gt;, an ancient giant slain by &lt;a href=\"Ysgramor\"&gt;Ysgramor&lt;/a&gt;. Once revived, the undead giant fused with &lt;a href=\"Thallik%20Wormfather\"&gt;Thallik Wormfather&lt;/a&gt;, a &lt;a href=\"Bretons%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Breton&lt;/a&gt; leading the Rift Worm Cultist forces. The giant then assaulted &lt;a href=\"Riften%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Riften&lt;/a&gt;, leaving many dead and the city's northern district in ruins.\nThe shards of Wuuthrad were scattered all over the Rift. Though the Worm Cult tried to retrieve them to increase Sinmur's power, the Vestige was guided by spirits of the &lt;a href=\"Five%20Hundred%20Companions\"&gt;Five Hundred Companions&lt;/a&gt; and obtained them first.\n&lt;a href=\"Jorunn%20the%20Skald-King\"&gt;Jorunn the Skald-King&lt;/a&gt; led Pact and Companion forces to the &lt;a href=\"Daedric%20Ruins%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Daedric ruins&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"Trolhetta\"&gt;Trolhetta&lt;/a&gt; in the mountains near Riften, where Sinmur and the remaining Worm Cultists had gathered for a last stand. The Vestige spearheaded the assault on the ruins, and finally fought Sinmur with the help of King Jorunn and Vigrod Wraithbane. Using the shards of Wuuthrad, they were able to separate the spirits of Sinmur and Thallik, who were then slain.\nVigrod Wraithbane was also present at the meeting at &lt;a href=\"Stirk\"&gt;Stirk&lt;/a&gt;, serving as an advisor and guard to King Jorunn during the negotiations with &lt;a href=\"Queen%20Ayrenn%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Queen Ayrenn&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"High%20King%20Emeric%20%28Online%29\"&gt;High King Emeric&lt;/a&gt;.\nMembers.\nGeneric:"}

He needs my help to discover the secret hidden within the ruins.\"\nWalkthrough.\nVerandis is standing outside Lorkrata Hills. He is eager to know why the ruins located here were kept out of his memories. He has located a trap door and asks the Vestige to find a way to unlock it, after which he will meet them at the west tower. He warns the Vestige to be careful, fearing the enemy is one step ahead of them. Upon entering the Ruins, Verandis will notice a veil has been cast upon the ruins. He believes &lt;a href=\"Lady%20Lleraya%20Montclair\"&gt;Lleraya&lt;/a&gt; had anticipated his arrival and cast the veil to serve as an obstacle.\nWhen spoken to, Verandis explains that the veil is a simple illusion spell meant to hide the true topography and make them see exactly what Lleraya wants them to see. He further adds that Lleraya is amplifying the spell by using the power of the Lightless Remnant. Verandis notes Lleraya hadn't been expecting the Vestige, meaning they can guide them through the veil using the tears that litter the illusion. By examining the veil, the Vestige is able to widen the tear and see the path ahead as it truly is. However, the Vestige and Verandis must fight their way through because they have disturbed the ancient ruin and awoken its guardians.\nAs the Vestige and Verandis progress through the ruin, the Vestige must locate various tears and reveal the true path kept hidden from them. Once the last veil has been dealt with, Verandis will direct the Vestige through the double doors. On the other side, Verandis will pass through another set of doors and locate the book they have been searching for.\nThe book proves to be an intact volume of Ayleid lore. Verandis is surprised to learn, however, that it talks about the Remnant of Light before it became corrupted. It mentions the Remnant requires a vessel to make full use of its limitless potential. It is deduced that &lt;a href=\"Baron%20Montclair\"&gt;Baron Montclair&lt;/a&gt; is the vessel. By breaking the vessel, Verandis learns, they also break the relic. Upon leaving the ruin through a veil, the Vestige can speak to Verandis again and he will tell them of his intent to use the Ayleid book to help in their journeys ahead. Verandis promptly awards the Vestige for their help at the ruins."}

And &lt;a href=\"Daedric%20Princes\"&gt;Daedra Lords&lt;/a&gt; feast upon the souls of mortals like ravening wolves.\nAll these we abominate, and drive them from the realms of decent folk with fire and hammer. And to aid us in this, our great work, &lt;a href=\"Arkay\"&gt;Arkay&lt;/a&gt; has given us his Three Consecrations:\nArkay's Grace, which we bestow upon birth, to protect the souls of the innocent until they are old enough to exercise their own volition.\nArkay's Blessing, which we bestow upon the dying, to prevent their souls from being used without consent.\nArkay's Law, which we bestow upon the deceased, that their corporeal forms may not be raised to unlawful servitude.\nThere is no more sacred trust than that of the order which you enter today, novice. Be strong, and waver not, for the enemies of life are ever watchful, ready to punish negligence with swift and ruthless cruelty."}

One of the Star-Gazers needs help uncovering what might be happening.\"\nWalkthrough.\nIn the north of &lt;a href=\"Belkarth%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Belkarth&lt;/a&gt;, you will find a woman named Qasna at-Toura. She will tell you that Erold is researching something interesting for the &lt;a href=\"Star-Gazers\"&gt;Star-Gazers&lt;/a&gt; that you might want to help with. Erold can be found in the &lt;a href=\"Crossroads%20Tavern\"&gt;Crossroads Tavern&lt;/a&gt;; speak with him and he will tell you that this is not the first time the &lt;a href=\"Celestial\"&gt;Celestial&lt;/a&gt;s have come down to Craglorn. He thinks they are connected to artifacts called the &lt;a href=\"Apex%20Stones\"&gt;Apex Stones&lt;/a&gt;. However, to get to the Apex Stones, you need a &lt;a href=\"Nedic\"&gt;Nedic&lt;/a&gt; amulet, which are hard to come by as the Nedes disappeared centuries ago. He suspects one may be found at the ruins of &lt;a href=\"Shada%27s%20Tear\"&gt;Shada's Tear&lt;/a&gt;.\nHead for &lt;a href=\"Mtharnaz\"&gt;Mtharnaz&lt;/a&gt;, southeast of the &lt;a href=\"Bangkorai%20Gate\"&gt;Bangkorai Gate&lt;/a&gt;. Many Nedes were kept as slaves here back in the day. You will find the amulet you need in the westernmost room. Once you take it, &lt;a href=\"The%20Thief%20%28Celestial%29\"&gt;the Thief&lt;/a&gt; will appear and tell you that this amulet is capable of more than just opening the way to the Warrior's apex stone. She will tell you to charge it at the Mundus Stones of the Lord, the Lady and the Steed. \nThe Steed is just north of your current location, the Warrior is northwest of &lt;a href=\"The%20Seeker%27s%20Archive%20%28Location%29\"&gt;the Seeker's Archive&lt;/a&gt; and the lady is on an island in the lake south of &lt;a href=\"Dragonstar%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Dragonstar&lt;/a&gt;. Upon charging the amulet at the first of these stones, the Thief will appear and tell you that &lt;a href=\"The%20Serpent%20%28Celestial%29\"&gt;the Serpent&lt;/a&gt; poisoned the Warrior's mind, but that hopefully with the help of the charged Skystone Amulet, he can be brought back. At the second mundus stone, the Thief will tell you that the Serpent's followers, the &lt;a href=\"Scaled%20Court\"&gt;Scaled Court&lt;/a&gt;, have found and corrupted the Warrior's Apex Stone, but she believes that with the power of the Lord, the Lady and the Steed, he can be brought back. At the third Mundus Stone, the Thief will tell you to head to Kardala where the Apex Stone rests, and use your amulet to cleanse it. Kardala can be found in the middle of where you found the mundus stones. \nOnce inside Kardala, proceed to the northwest. There, you will run into the Thief Again; she will tell you that beyond this door, the Warrior's charges will guide your way. Head in and fight your way through the dungeon's boss, &lt;a href=\"Izrunath%20the%20Corruptor\"&gt;Izrunath the Corruptor&lt;/a&gt;. Take care though, as this boss is very strong and will summon serpents to help him in battle. Once the boss lies dead, cleanse the Apex Stone. &lt;a href=\"The%20Lord%20%28Celestial%29\"&gt;The Lord&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"The%20Lady%20%28Celestial%29\"&gt;the Lady&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"The%20Steed%20%28Celestial%29\"&gt;the Steed&lt;/a&gt; wull appear to talk sense into the Warrior. This will work; the apex stone will be cleansed. However, afterward, the Serpent will appear to tell you that the Warrior is trapped in mortal form and is still under his control. \nWith this, head back to Belkarth and speak with Star-Gazer Erold to finish the quest."}

The trail leads to an isolated inn somewhere in the wilds of Eastmarch. We need to determine what the coven has planned before it's too late.\"\nWalkthrough.\nUpon completing &lt;a href=\"The%20Coven%20Conspiracy\"&gt;The Coven Conspiracy&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Lyris%20Titanborn%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Lyris Titanborn&lt;/a&gt; will await you by a cart that will take you to &lt;a href=\"The%20Grinning%20Horker\"&gt;The Grinning Horker&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Eastmarch%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Eastmarch&lt;/a&gt;. Travel there with her to find out what the &lt;a href=\"Icereach%20Coven\"&gt;Icereach Coven&lt;/a&gt; are up to. The cart will only actually take you to just past &lt;a href=\"Voljar%27s%20Meadery\"&gt;Voljar's Meadery&lt;/a&gt;, you will have to walk to the Grinning Horker from there. Just follow the path up the mountain.\nOnce you have reached the inn, head inside. The inn will be abandoned. Speak with Lyris Titanborn and she will tell you to look for clues concerning the fate of the people the witches have led here. The first clue is the abandoned meal on the table. The second clue is upstairs in the used bedrolls; people have been here recently. Once you have found these two clues, the third clue will appear, a blood trail leading to the basement. \nHead into the basement, and you will find it empty. Lyris will instruct you to look for a secret passageway. The passageway you are looking for is in the cabinet against the west wall. Head in there, and you will find yourself in a strange cavern filled with glowing mushrooms. in this cavern, you will find a man named &lt;a href=\"Hrolt\"&gt;Hrolt&lt;/a&gt;, who will tell you that he escaped the witches and that they are doing something horrible to the other captives. While you are talking to him, Lyris will have gone ahead a bit, to a cliff overlooking &lt;a href=\"Blackreach\"&gt;Blackreach&lt;/a&gt;. Speak with her, and she will tell you to go explore Blackreach and destroy any witch pikes you find while she brings Hrolt back to The Grinning Horker. \nHead down and explore Blackreach. You will have three objectives down here: to destroy the witch pike, to gather the Coven's notes and to free the prisoners. A logical first target is the witch pike; it is located in the east next to the tower. After you have destroyed it, go for the notes, which will be in the northern part of the cavern, east of the bridge, by a campfire. The notes will detail experiments the coven are doing in creating new kinds of bloodfiends. After you have done these two things, the area will start sprawling with enemies so beware. Your last objective is to free the prisoners, who are being held in the northwest part of the cavern. \nAfter you have cleared these objectives, you will be approached by Amberic Daigre, one of the prisoners you freed. He will tell you that the leader of the witches, Sister Balra, is holed up in the Dwemer Ruins to the west. Head towards the ruins and you will see Lyris cut down a witch. Speak with her and tell her what you have learned, then head into the ruins with her. Inside the ruins, you will find a man named &lt;a href=\"Sentry%20Darfal\"&gt;Sentry Darfal&lt;/a&gt; on the ground. Speak with him, and he will say that he erroneously told the witch how to sneak into the Palace of the Kings in Windhelm, so the &lt;a href=\"Jorunn%20the%20Skald-King\"&gt;Skald-King&lt;/a&gt; might be in danger now. \nSpeak with Lyris and travel with her to Windhelm. Once there, head for the Palace of the Kings and talk to &lt;a href=\"Housecarl%20Vaer\"&gt;Housecarl Vaer&lt;/a&gt; so she will let you in. Head inside and search the building for the Skald-King. The witches will already have a presence here, so be prepared. The bodies will have fragments of a map of western Skyrim on them; in the room on the left there is a map of Skyrim that these pieces were torn from. Head throuth the rooms counterclockwise and you will eventually come upon the body of a guard. Take the key to the dungeons from her body, and look for Jorunn there. You will find Sister Balra doing something to the king there. Save him by killing her. Once you have defeated Balra once, she will turn into a giant werewolf and summon some skeletal werewolves. Kill this form too and she will be done. Jorunn will then tell you to speak with him in the throne room. \nHead to the throne room and tell the King everything you have learned. He will tell you to speak with Lyris on a course of action. Talk to Lyris and she will give you your reward."}

There I had opportunity to examine the corpses of several prisoners who, by all accounts, had been extremely violent and disturbed individuals. While performing a routine autopsy on an infamous Colovian brigand named &lt;a href=\"Villius\"&gt;Villius&lt;/a&gt;, I discovered an unusual indentation at the base of his skull. From this singular observation, I developed a theory with two key points.\nFirst, criminal behavior originates in large measure from deformities of the brain. Second, violent criminals may exhibit skull structures of the earlier races of Mer and Men, known for their violence. These criminals, I believe, can therefore be identified on the basis of similar physical characteristics, such as a large jaw and a sloping forehead.\nBased upon my copious research and the measurements of such traits, I have created a hierarchy of criminal species among the races, with Nords, Redguards, and Dunmer at the top, and Bosmer, Bretons, and Khajiit at the bottom. I must profess a greater appreciation for the common caliper!\nSadly, attempts to publish my theories have only been met with hostility and derision. I have been openly accused of deriding the races! I have decided, therefore, to set my work down on paper in the hopes that future generations might be more willing to examine this entirely new branch of science with opened minds."}

They had no structure, organization, nor legacy. They had few tactics in the field and little design for the future. Worst of all they had no loyalty beyond filling their own pockets. A bandit clan was a pack of stray dogs fighting for scraps, willing to bite the hand if it dared to feed them.\nGrowing up in &lt;a href=\"Balmora\"&gt;Balmora&lt;/a&gt;, Tyra knew that the Great Houses of &lt;a href=\"Morrowind\"&gt;Morrowind&lt;/a&gt; were built on blood. Yet as an orphan child and a &lt;a href=\"Nords%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Nord&lt;/a&gt; amongst &lt;a href=\"Elves\"&gt;Elves&lt;/a&gt;, her concept of family was one forged from experience. It wasn't the bandits and cutthroats, but the loners and outcasts she identified with most. So when she picked out the crew that would become the &lt;a href=\"The%20Crimson%20Dirks%20%28Faction%29\"&gt;Crimson Dirks&lt;/a&gt;, she sought out the qualities that best defined herself.\nWhat she wanted were survivors.\nTo find them, she would first need connections. For this, she sought the help of a &lt;a href=\"Dunmer%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Dark Elf&lt;/a&gt; named &lt;a href=\"Reaver%20%28Character%29\"&gt;Reaver&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe Dunmer had no real name to speak of. Some speculated he was once a noble, having abandoned his titles and claims for a new one. Others believed he was with the &lt;a href=\"Morag%20Tong\"&gt;Morag Tong&lt;/a&gt;, assassins having little use for their birth name. Tyra, meanwhile, had first met the brigand as a child begging in the streets. The Dark Elf had fixed his blood red eyes upon this orphan girl, ashen and starved, and deigned to fill her alms bowl.\nWhen she looked down, she found neither food nor gold, but a knife.\n\"This isn't a gift, little &lt;a href=\"netch\"&gt;netch&lt;/a&gt;,\" the Dunmer cautioned, throat scarred with ash, \"your first score belongs to me.\"\nThat night young Tyra would make good on that promise, delivering a single ruby into the &lt;a href=\"ashlander\"&gt;ashlander&lt;/a&gt;'s palm. It glowed crimson like fire and blood, and from that day she was known as Tyra Blood-Fire, earning her name just as Reaver did from his deeds. As the years passed, the Dunmer kept a close eye on the Nord, tracking her growth from a cutpurse to a bandit. And while she considered her debt to Reaver paid, whenever their paths crossed, he would continue to demand a cut.\nEight years later, and the two had gone their separate ways - not just in distance, but in spirit and mind. Tyra had matured into a tenacious warrior, her physique chiseled and rough, a body forged in a crucible of blood and ash. Reaver, on the other hand, had grown fat and lazy, content to skim off the labor of his subordinates while he spent his days in quiet repose.\nAs Tyra stood before him, he played with a ruby in his palm, occasionally using his forearm to wipe the saliva from his greasy lips. While Tyra recognized the gem almost immediately, the Dark Elf bared little resemblance to the vicious killer she once knew.\nPerhaps it was Cyrodiil that changed him. He had traded his netch leather for fine silks, his dagger for a silver spoon, and his ashland cave for a highborn residence in the heart of Skingrad. His scowl was not one of rage, but irritation, chiefly at his guest for tracking mud on his freshly waxed floors. Only the eyes, scarlet and piercing, betrayed his former identity.\n\"I'm new to &lt;a href=\"Cyrodiil\"&gt;Cyrodiil&lt;/a&gt;,\" she said, placing a bag of gold on the table as tithe, \"and I need a crew.\"\nThe Dunmer beckoned a servant to hand him the gold, as he could no longer be bothered to reach for it. He examined the bag briefly to judge its weight, before shooing the servant and the gold aside. Tyra wondered if she had been better served filling the bag with cakes.\n\"I will help you find these men,\" the Dunmer croaked, finger rapping the table, \"but remember, little netch, your first score belongs to me.\"\nOf men who fit her requirements, there were three. &lt;a href=\"Aesrael\"&gt;Aesrael&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"Altmer%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;High Elf&lt;/a&gt; hunter, had grown up in an orphanage. &lt;a href=\"Peladius\"&gt;Peladius&lt;/a&gt; was a former guardsman, dismissed for beating a pickpocket to death. &lt;a href=\"Antonius\"&gt;Antonius&lt;/a&gt; was a hedge mage who spent more time at the tavern than the guild.\nThere were still others she wanted before the crew could be whole. She wanted a blacksmith to forge arms, and muscle to wield it. She wanted a thief who could stalk their prey in the shadows, and assassins to slit their throats. She wanted scouts to glean information, and sharp minds to decipher their code. And she was willing to travel the breadth of &lt;a href=\"Tamriel\"&gt;Tamriel&lt;/a&gt; to find them.\nBut for this first job, three was more than enough. One was all she needed. After all, she had already cased the building, having been invited as a guest. She had seen the servant girl deposit the gold in the next room, and the piles of riches scattered throughout the house. And she had watched as their plump, horker of an owner, lost his edge and taste for the work. For it was the reaver and all his riches that they would come for first.\nA week later, the three sealed their pact in blood. Aesrael and Peladius, being trained warriors, made quick work of the guards. Antonius bespelled the servants with his magic, and together the crew filled the wagons with their spoils.\nBut before all that was done, Tyra first found the once fearsome reaver in his bed chambers, helpless to stop what his greed had ordained.\nIn the shadow of a lantern's light, the Nord approached him with arms extended. In one hand was the bag of gold she had given him the week prior. In the other was the knife he had placed in her alms bowl so many years ago.\n\"I want you to have this,\" Reaver said, placing the ruby on the nightstand beside him. Tyra, for her part, never said a word.\n\"I wasn't always a reaver,\" the Dark Elf continued, \"I used to have a proper name. Casival, they called me. Funny story, there's a &lt;a href=\"Casival\"&gt;Dunmer boy&lt;/a&gt;, peddling for alms outside the &lt;a href=\"Two%20Sisters%20Lodge\"&gt;Two Sisters Lodge&lt;/a&gt; with the same name.\"\nUpon hearing his words, Tyra's eyes met Reaver's for the last time, standing over him as he once did her. Perhaps in that moment another deal was made, understood but left unspoken.\nSeconds later, she plunged the knife into his heart.\nWhen it was done, Tyra wiped the blood-stained dirk on the bedsheet and picked up the ruby from the . In the hours that passed the crew sacked the place clean, all save the bag of gold, which she left next to her former employer's corpse.\nThe first score, after all, belonged to him. The rest she took for herself."}

With every crate added to their coffers, Tyra hoped their influence could spider across the breadth of &lt;a href=\"Tamriel\"&gt;Tamriel&lt;/a&gt;, earning both fear and respect amongst those who plied their trade in the shadows.\nAs bandits, however, they would rely first and foremost on the sacking of caravans. They would stalk the highways and thoroughfares for carriages full of goods, and quickly relieve them of their belongings. For this task the &lt;a href=\"Khajiit%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Khajiit&lt;/a&gt;, M'Sharra, found herself best suited. Her eyes were keen at identifying a heavy wagon, from the spin of its wheels to the tracks carving through the dirt. She could spot a weary guard by the slump of his shoulders or the pace of his gait. Her eyes saw clearly even in the dead of night, while others were slaves to the light of their torches.\nAnd what she lacked in strength, the other bandits were willing to provide.\nOn this night, however, their victims put up little fight, their numbers comprised of monks and priests who were all too ready to unite with their makers. The wagon they plundered was destined for a temple, and its crates full of treasures that offered more tribute than gold.\n\"Do you think Tyra would like this?\" asked M'Sharra, popping her head out from behind the wagon, an &lt;a href=\"Amulet%20of%20Talos\"&gt;Amulet of Talos&lt;/a&gt; dangling from her ear.\n\"A bandit has no need for gods or prayer,\" grumbled Urgnok, wiping the blood from his battleaxe, \"it's a terrible gift.\"\n\"Nonsense,\" countered Bjormund, unloading a crate, \"all Nords love &lt;a href=\"Talos\"&gt;Talos&lt;/a&gt;, almost as much as they love mead!\"\n\"Of course you would say that, frost licker,\" snarled Urgnok, \"but by &lt;a href=\"Malacath\"&gt;Malacath&lt;/a&gt;, Tyra is not like the rest of you idiots. She has taste.\"\nIf Tyra were like any other Nord, Urgnok would have never pledged her his axe. In his mind, the Nords were pale-faced, poetry loving giants who ate with their fingers and drank from a horn. Tyra, however, did not think or feel or smell like the other Nords did, and more importantly, did not fight like them. She preferred the acrid bite of a &lt;a href=\"sujamma\"&gt;sujamma&lt;/a&gt; bottle to a snowback's &lt;a href=\"Nord%20Mead%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;honeyed drink&lt;/a&gt;, and despised poetry in all its forms. He surmised she might've been from &lt;a href=\"Morrowind\"&gt;Morrowind&lt;/a&gt;, but the Orc was not the type to pry into another's business.\n\"Oh?\" said M'Sharra with a mischievous grin, the amulet swaying as her ears perked up, \"and what are you planning to get her, Urgnok?\"\n\"What? Why would I get her anything?\" the Orc replied coldly, \"you'll all be dead in a year anyway.\"\nM'Sharra blanched at the words, unsure if the Orc was making a joke or speaking prophecy. While hardly a mage, Urgnok was known to dabble in dark magic, wearing tribal scars and marks on his body, and totems of bone around his neck. Unlike with the blacksmith Yakhtu, his anger seemed to stem not from the hardened nature of his blood, but something deeper and personal, and it colored every conversation they had. The others stewed in silence at his remarks until the young Bosmer, Fathrys, broke the ice.\n\"Speaking of which, did you want anything for the holidays, Zaharia?\" he mewled, a rose of blush affecting his soft brown skin. The Redguard, in return, paid him little heed as she examined the wagon's horses.\n\"If you want to get me a &lt;a href=\"Saturalia\"&gt;Saturalia&lt;/a&gt; gift,\" said Zaharia, pointing at the arrows lodged in the wagon's side, \"work on your aim. I'll feel better about having you at my back when you can kill more than planks of wood.\"\n\"That is all well and good,\" interrupted M'Sharra, \"but there is a far more important matter than life and death, for this Khajiit still does not have a suitable present.\"\n\"If it's from the heart,\" Fathrys said, eyes fixated on the Redguard, \"the amulet will be good enough.\"\nTwo weeks later on a cold Saturalia night, Tyra Blood-Fire awoke to the sound of a crackling fire. A note was placed on her private safe, which she opened to find an amulet wrapped in cloth. The Khajiit had snuck into her room earlier and left the gift and the fire behind, as proof of both her generosity and skill.\nTyra was not religious by nature, but as she stood in that warm, reddish glow, something about the Amulet of Talos resonated with her. Perhaps it was the letter she received from Peladius that morning, about an encounter with the Thalmor in Dune. In that instance, a thought crept into her mind and soon blossomed into an idea. The following day she beckoned the blacksmith to her chambers, the idea having matured into a plan.\n\"I want you to forge me more of these amulets,\" Tyra said, placing the axe-shaped necklace on the table before her.\nThe blacksmith picked up the artifact and studied its make, thumbing across the intricate patterns grooved into the piece. Unlike other amulets, it was simple yet ornate, its blades casting a neutral tone that neither reflected nor absorbed the surrounding candlelight.\n\"This is made with &lt;a href=\"Dragon%20Bone%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;dragonbone&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Dragon%20Scales%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;scales&lt;/a&gt;,\" Yakhtu replied, \"hard to come by these days, but a replica should be simple enough. I guess my only question is, why? Seems odd for bandits to turn to the &lt;a href=\"Divines\"&gt;Divines&lt;/a&gt; for help.\"\n\"Last week, there was a trade caravan traveling on the &lt;a href=\"Silver%20Road\"&gt;Silver Road&lt;/a&gt;, torched by &lt;a href=\"Thalmor%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Thalmor&lt;/a&gt; Justiciars,\" Tyra said, \"Apparently they killed the merchant on suspicion of Talos worship. And it's not just here. I've gotten word from &lt;a href=\"Peladius\"&gt;Peladius&lt;/a&gt; that the Thalmor are making an effort to eliminate anyone and everyone in possession of these amulets, whether it be men in the streets or wagons on the road.\"\n\"Wagons,\" replied Yakhtu, \"like the ones we sack.\"\n\"Exactly. The amulets aren't armor or jewelry or tribute,\" said Tyra, \"they're a motive. We place one on every caravan we sack, and torch the wagons when we're done looting them. The guards blame the Thalmor, and we keep the spoils.\"\nYakhtu nodded and took her leave, mind set on forging the amulets. Tyra knew well enough that the smith didn't need the artifact with her, having already committed it to memory. The blacksmith's genius was different from the others - quiet, removed, and matched only by her insatiable work ethic. The amulets would be done by daybreak, and there was no need for this one to be included.\nTyra returned the amulet to the safe, when she noticed another item nestled amongst the piles of gold and gems. It was the tooth of an Orc chief, one typically earned by besting its owner in single combat.\nTyra herself knew of one such Orc, a son who had been forced to kill his father against his will. Heartbroken, the son wore this tooth as a keepsake around his neck, fearing the day he would have to slay his future children. Until one day the son met a Nord bandit, who became &lt;a href=\"Blood-Kin\"&gt;Blood-Kin&lt;/a&gt; of the tribe and challenged him to a duel.\nThe bandit bested the Orc in single combat, and recognizing the pain that haunted him, freed him from his duties as chief. She asked not for his tooth, but his blade when the time came. Yet it wasn't until after the Nord formed the Crimson Dirks that she returned to that Orc, and asked him to make good on his oath.\nTyra smiled as she recalled the memory. She didn't know Urgnok had pulled the tooth, but it didn't surprise her in the least."}

A &lt;a href=\"Nords%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Nord&lt;/a&gt; butcher, catching his glance, waved hello to the &lt;a href=\"Imperials%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Imperial&lt;/a&gt;, before returning to his trade.\nAt the table behind him, &lt;a href=\"Erwan\"&gt;Erwan&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Edward%20%28The%20Crimson%20Dirks%29\"&gt;Edward&lt;/a&gt; were with the buyer, playing an old &lt;a href=\"Khajiit%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Khajiit&lt;/a&gt; game of tiles and bones; a fool's wager given they barely understood the rules.\nAs the septims slowly poured over to the Khajiit's end of the table, Peladius' thoughts turned to his friends back in &lt;a href=\"Cyrodiil\"&gt;Cyrodiil&lt;/a&gt;, and prayed to &lt;a href=\"Zenithar\"&gt;Zenithar&lt;/a&gt; that luck had found them in their part of the world.\n\"If Khajiit may ask,\" he said, adding an ante, \"this merchandise you wish to move, is it by chance connected to the recent theft in the palace?\"\n\"Khajiit may not ask,\" snapped Erwan, \"or Erwan will remove his tongue.\"\n\"Pardon his rudeness,\" the cat demurred, \"but the sands are full of talk regarding the heist of the Clan Mother's treasury.\"\n\"Oh, give him a break,\" teased Edward, \"if you wanted to hide your identity, you probably should've chosen a disguise that didn't include the Clan Mother's personal wardrobe.\"\nErwan scowled at her brother, angry at herself for not having a proper comeback. The Khajiit, meanwhile, glanced at his tiles and fiddled with his ring, an action that did not go unnoticed.\n\"Yes, although it was not the silk, but the sword that gave her away,\" the Khajiit said, revealing another winning hand, \"a common blade would not have such an elegant scabbard.\"\n\"We should drop the weapons and just grow our nails out,\" Edward sighed, as the cat's claws raked in another pot, \"maybe then we'd have better luck.\"\n\"If you want to take that risk, be my guest,\" Peladius chimed in, \"but if we get into a fight, I'd feel better if my hands were clutching Imperial steel.\"\n\"You'd feel better, sure!\" Edward countered, \"But how do I know I wasn't destined to be a mage?\"\nThere was a time when Peladius wondered the same about Edward. At first glance he was more dashing noble than thief, but behind the smile and charm was a cunning and calculating wit. Some might argue that Edward was better suited for the job than Peladius could ever be. For the best rogues cut their enemies not with the edge of their dagger, but the sharpness of their mind.\n\"Either way, Khajiit is excited to meet such daring thieves. How many outsiders would even try such a thing, given the consequences?\"\n\"What do you mean by that?\" Edward replied, examining his tiles.\n\"Well, the Clan Mothers are allies of the &lt;a href=\"Aldmeri%20Dominion%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Dominion&lt;/a&gt;. Their eyes are all-seeing, and their punishments are known to all who hear the screams.\"\n\"And what do you think about that, furball?\" Erwan interrupted, eyes focused on the Khajiit, \"are you a fan of the Dominion? Do you have paintings at home of &lt;a href=\"Lady%20Arannelya\"&gt;Lady Arannelya&lt;/a&gt; in fancy lace?\"\n\"Khajiit does not care for politics,\" he said, raising the pot, \"He is sorry to have brought it up.\"\n\"Oh, don't mind my sister, she's just touched by &lt;a href=\"Sheogorath\"&gt;Sheogorath&lt;/a&gt;,\" replied Edward, calling the bet, \"I, for one, love a good political discussion. It allows us to find a common ground. After all, why do you think people get into conflicts in the first place?\"\n\"Khajiit would assume it is because two sides cannot reconcile their differences.\"\n\"You'd think that. One person calls &lt;a href=\"Talos\"&gt;Talos&lt;/a&gt; a man, and the other a god, and the next thing you know, they're at each other's throats. But I've seen blood feuds started over the love of a woman, and wars fought over inches on a map.\nThe truth is, people don't fight because they're different. They fight because their motivations are one and the same. That's true whether you're the &lt;a href=\"Third%20Empire\"&gt;Empire&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Thalmor\"&gt;Thalmor&lt;/a&gt;, or a Clan Mother and a thief.\"\n\"And what, by the moons, unites you and the Clan Mother? What is this motivation you both share?\"\n\"The same thing that drives you,\" Edward smiled, laying out his tiles on the table.\n\"Greed.\"\nThe hand was indeed a winner, but of greater concern to the Khajiit was the note Edward placed beside it. The merchant recognized it immediately. He had penned the letter that morning, with the intent to betray them to the Clan Mother in exchange for a hefty sum of sugar and gold.\nStartled, he reached for his weapon, but it was too late. Erwan had already drawn hers.\n\"It doesn't matter,\" the Khajiit merchant said, \"this letter was for the Clan Mother. But the one to the guard is already-\"\nBefore Edward could interject, Erwan slit the Khajiit's throat.\nAs the blood splattered all over her silk garment, a scream could be heard from the market. A Thalmor Justiciar, flanked by two guards, had dragged the Nord butcher from his stall, accusing him Talos worship.\nThe Justiciar tore open the butcher's tunic, but found only an &lt;a href=\"Amulet%20of%20Mara\"&gt;Amulet of Mara&lt;/a&gt;. The butcher replied with a toothy grin, asking the Thalmor if she was spoken for. The Justiciar, digusted, tossed the butcher into his stall before returning to her patrol.\nPeladius shut the window. They may have won the day, but the war was another story. For now, they had a long journey ahead of them, and a body to dispose."}

Casival squinted at the young &lt;a href=\"Bosmer%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Bosmer&lt;/a&gt;, trying to get a read on his mood. Just hours earlier the lad had embarked on the biggest quest of his life, the kind of endeavor that turns squires into warriors, boys into men.\n\"Well, what did she say?\" he asked the young bandit.\n\"She said she would only wed me,\" &lt;a href=\"Fathrys\"&gt;Fathrys&lt;/a&gt; said, \"if I brought her the scale of a dragon.\"\nThe tavern burst into laughter, patrons smacking their tankards against the wood.\n\"What?\" Fathrys replied, clearly confused, \"What's so funny?\"\n\"I'm sorry lad,\" said Casival, \"but I think that's her way of saying 'No.'\"\nFathrys was crestfallen. It had taken nearly all of his courage to confess his love to &lt;a href=\"Zaharia\"&gt;Zaharia&lt;/a&gt;. What meager defenses remained in his youthful frame, Casival could not guess, but they stood little chance against this latest assault. In fact, with each passing second Fathrys' shoulders slumped further and further into his chest, until he was more Guar than man. Taking pity, Casival decided to massage the boy's ego with a tale of his first rejection, when a familiar voice croaked at the pair from across the room.\n\"A &lt;a href=\"Dragon%20Scales%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;dragon scale&lt;/a&gt;, you say?\"\nNot a soul had realized Antonius was in the tavern, mostly because the bandit mage was a permanent fixture. From dusk to dawn he teetered upon his wobbly chair, drinking all manner of spirits by his lonesome. Over time he began to blend into the scenery, like an odor that only strangers could smell.\n\"By the Nine, do you know where I can find one?\" Fathrys beamed with shoulders out, his once gloomy face resurrected with life.\n\"I'm a wizard, am I not?\" Antonius said, before letting out a dignified belch.\n\"A bandit wizard,\" Casival interjected, \"and with all due respect to you and your profession, I don't think you're helping.\"\n\"Nonsense, Casival,\" scolded the mage, nearly tripping over his own feet as he sat at the table, \"The boy needs a dragon scale, and I aim to help him find one.\"\n\"But the dragons have been extinct for centuries upon centuries,\" Casival said.\n\"You really are a bad student,\" scoffed Antonius, jabbing his finger into the &lt;a href=\"Dunmer%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Dunmer&lt;/a&gt;'s forehead, \"this is why Tyra favors &lt;a href=\"Edward%20%28The%20Crimson%20Dirks%29\"&gt;Edward&lt;/a&gt; over you. At least he pays attention.\"\n\"Forgive me, mage.\"\n\"Only the Divines can forgive you, my son. Drink this bottle, and it'll take you to them.\"\n\"What about the dragon scale?\" Fathrys whined, growing impatient.\n\"Oh right, that. Well, it just so happens, there's an old Nord legend about a warrior named &lt;a href=\"Ulfnir%20Bone-Skin\"&gt;Ulfnir Bone-Skin&lt;/a&gt;,\" Antonius explained, flecks of spit flying out of his mouth, \"who slew the serpent wyrm &lt;a href=\"Vithrelnaak\"&gt;Vithrelnaak&lt;/a&gt; and fashioned a powerful armor from his scales. When he died, instead of giving his armor away to his ungrateful pupils, he did what any self-respecting warrior would do, and buried himself with it.\"\n\"Well, that's too bad,\" said Casival, hoping to derail this runaway carriage, \"surely it would've been emptied out by grave robbers by now.\"\n\"You would think,\" Antonius screamed, raising his voice for no reason, \"but they say Ulfnir's corpse haunts the barrow near &lt;a href=\"Yorgrim%20Overlook\"&gt;Yorgrim's Overlook&lt;/a&gt;, and kills anyone who dares try and take his armor.\"\n\"I see! So it's a challenge!\" Fathrys exclaimed, \"In order to wear Ulfnir's armor, one must first best him as a warrior!\"\n\"Either that, or he just doesn't want some random stranger wearing his clothes. How would you feel if I showed up to your home wearing your undergarments? But yes, you kill Ulfnir, you get your dragon scale. You get your dragon scale, and you get your wench.\"\n\"She's not a wench. She's the most amazing woman in all of Mundus, and I'm going to marry her!\"\n\"Sure, whatever.\"\nCasival breathed a deep sigh as Fathrys' heart grew ill with hope. The only saving grace was that Windhelm was thousands of leagues away, and Fathrys was still a pup. Perhaps when he was ready for the work, a word or two with Tyra could send him further away still. Yet whatever remedy he devised would be temporary. He had seen that look too many times to deny what would come next.\nA fortnight later, Casival returned to the tavern. It was the same as it ever was, for the most part. The wenches tended to the patrons, and the patrons to their stress. The bards sang tales old and new, and the drunkards, not knowing the lyrics, still saw fit to join them. Antonius was perched in the corner as always, a bottle in each hand and several more on the ground.\nIt was like any other Fredas, save for the empty seat beside him.\nHe would break the news to Tyra in the morning. The Bosmer would not return."}

There were bad streaks at the card table, sudden pain in her tooth, and stale bottles of mead. Soon, the proof took on a larger, more dangerous form. Her blade would miss its mark. Potions would cure too slowly. Or she'd step on a rune that her barbarian companion, &lt;a href=\"Skjol\"&gt;Skjol&lt;/a&gt;, had no business skipping over. \nThen there was the greater proof, the instances that threatened their livelihood. There was the coin drying up, new guard patrols at the usual haunts, and word that the &lt;a href=\"East%20Empire%20Company\"&gt;East Empire Company&lt;/a&gt; had taken notice of their works. All told it augured a slow, tumbling march toward the end of the &lt;a href=\"The%20Crimson%20Dirks%20%28Faction%29\"&gt;Crimson Dirks&lt;/a&gt;.\nKnowing this, a smart person might've cast it out; tossed the foul ring into the heart of &lt;a href=\"Illiac%20Bay\"&gt;Illiac Bay&lt;/a&gt; and let the waves ferry it to forgotten shores. A wise person might've taken it a step further, destroying the artifact and its ill-fated magic, so that no person, past or present, would ever come to harm.\nErwan, of course, decided to wear it around her neck.\nWith regard to the ring's nature, she told only the barbarian. Her brother &lt;a href=\"Edward%20%28The%20Crimson%20Dirks%29\"&gt;Edward&lt;/a&gt; would refuse to believe her. The others would demand she get rid of it, in whatever manner best fit their inclinations. Skjol, on the other hand, would neither object nor disapprove. \nWhenever she confided in him, Skjol would simply stare at her blankly and let out a guttural snort before chewing on the nearest piece of meat. Skjol, after all, was not just a barbarian, but one who wore that label like a badge, or an honor bestowed upon him by the High King. Of words he knew few, and when he wrote them down, rarely did he put them in the right order. The only thng that spared him from further ignominy was the fact he couldn't speak.\nAs the story goes, the leader of the Crimson Dirks, &lt;a href=\"Tyra%20Blood-Fire\"&gt;Tyra Blood-Fire&lt;/a&gt;, found him in a cage with his tongue removed, and upon freeing him gained his axe. To this day it was never clear if Skjol was loyal to her or the crew, or whether that distinction had any meaning to him. If Tyra asked him to back Erwan on a job, he would do so without question, and absorb whatever secrets, insults, and curses the Breton decided to fling in his general direction.\nThat theory would be tested the moment she stepped on that rune.\nEarlier that week, they had received a tip. A new crew had set up a smuggler's operation in one of the old ruins outside the capital. It was supposed to be a simple task. They were to meet with the clan leaders, flex their muscle, and come home with new members or a percentage of the take. It all would've gone according to script, Erwan thought, had the ring not been cursed.\n\"This is all your fault,\" she said to no one in particular, while glaring at her disobedient hands. Moments earlier, the &lt;a href=\"Bretons%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Breton&lt;/a&gt; had awoken to the sound of chanting - a low and ominous moan floating through the chamber. The rune had blurred her sight, but it was the haunting refrain that seemed to dull her focus, unable to cast a spell. \nRegardless, it was clear their captors were more than smugglers. Erwan didn't need to see the source of the chanting to know it was bad business, no matter how long Skjol mindlessly pointed in that direction.\n\"Well, at least it isn't cannibals,\" Erwan sneered, \"although you being a choking hazard might've worked in our favor.\"\nSkjol wasn't the brightest Nord, but he knew when he was being insulted. In a past life, he would've simply crushed Erwan's skull and taken a nap. Moreover, cages were nothing new to him, and Erwan's noisy jests were to him, signs of panic. But he had sworn a vow to protect the charges of the one they called Blood-Fire, and so rather than kill the Breton for looking at him oddly, Skjol continued to point, much to Erwan's confusion. \nThe shrine behind her was &lt;a href=\"Daedric\"&gt;Daedric&lt;/a&gt; in origin - large, twisted and barbed, its stems ugly and misshapen. Blood dripped from its ebony thorns, spilling past the cage and down the stone steps like shifting roots. At the base of the steps stood robed cultists, lost in their supplication, flanked by guards dressed in Daedric armor and &lt;a href=\"Daedric%20Mail%20Armor%20%28Skyrim%20Creation%20Club%29\"&gt;mail&lt;/a&gt;. Despite an open roof, the air in the ruins was thick and noxious, and the shrine seemed to throb in the blood moon's light.\nAs the light shone on the altar, the cultist chants began to turn more vehement and forceful. The voices continued to rise, louder and louder, until one of the guards broke from his stance, climbing the steps toward the cage. Seeing this, Erwan bared her teeth and snarled at him like an animal, but he continued his approach undeterred. As the chants hit a crescendo, Erwan could no longer hear her own thoughts, seeing nothing save the cold, black gauntlet split through the bars and reach for her neck. \nWith a thrust the guard grabbed her by the head and slammed her into the bars, drawing his weapon with his other hand. With spit bubbling from her mouth and her body pressed against the iron, Erwan screamed at Skjol every manner of insult she could contrive. But the oaf continued to sit in place, his finger still extended, even as the cultists' chant drummed against their ears. Only now the finger was pointed to the ground, tracing a circle.\nErwan looked down and saw the ring, glowing hotly on her chest. \nSkjol didn't need to tell her what to do next. She wrung herself free of the guard's grasp, and not knowing what would happen, placed the ring on her finger.\nThe chanting stopped. And in its place, the shrill cry of weapons drawn from their scabbards. The Daedric warrior turned his attention to the cultists, but it was too late. Erwan's spell of hysteria had taken hold, her focus restored by the power of the ring. One by one the cultists turned on each other, their rage driven by hers. And when the clangs of metal faded and the screams turned to silence, Erwan collapsed, having exhausted all of herself and the ring.\nAs the hours passed into the day, Erwan lay there on the floor of her cage, letting the sun splash through the bars. Skjol snored softly in his corner, shifting on occasion to scratch himself. Outside, ravens picked at the flesh of the dead, sharpening their beaks on the bones and paying no mind to the living. \nThe others would come looking for them eventually, and fetch M'Sharra to pick the lock. But for now Erwan was content as she was. She held the ring up against the sky, circling the area where the moon once stood. Perhaps she had made a mistake, and the ring wasn't cursed after all.\nBut Erwan still held out hope."}

A cloth, stained with every conceivable color of wine and spirit, was placed over the top of the wood, allowing the bones and tiles to slide across its otherwise splintered face. While some of the rules were lost in translation, Edward knew enough for the game to function. Moreover, if he were to bend said rules to his favor, his opponents would be none the wiser.\n\"There are two types of games,\" Edward explained, laying the tiles out on the surface, \"those with perfect information, and those that are imperfect. Chess, for example, is a game with perfect information. We know each other's pieces and their placement on the board. Card games, on the other hand, are of the imperfect variety. We are each dealt a hand with a set value, and must divine, through whatever means are available to us, who has the better of it.\"\n\"And which type do you prefer?\" asked Casival.\n\"I prefer to know who and what I'm dealing with,\" replied Edward, \"but at the same time, I know the more practical skill is to play games where the information is imperfect. After all, that is how the world around us is played.\"\n\"I wasn't aware life was a game,\" said Ehlhiel, \"because if so, I need to find a better way to cheat.\"\n\"Don't be so modest,\" replied Edward, raking in another pot, \"I think you're doing just fine. The same can't be said for our friend Antonius here.\"\n\"I only lost because you distracted me,\" barked Antonius, \"with that inhaling and exhaling thing you do with your nose.\"\n\"Do you mean breathing?\" asked Edward.\n\"Yes, that.\"\nAs a careful study of others, Casival understood the gist of Edward's speech. There were layers beyond what faces advertised. Edward, for instance, used his charm and intellect like a sword, his sly demeanor having a purpose that disarmed his opponents. Ehlhiel, on the other hand, wore his humor like armor, deflecting any inkling of emotion or motive. Zaharia, for all her straightforwardness, was also passionate and sincere, making her prone to falling victim to her temper. Even Antonius, for all his inebriation, was a skilled hedge mage, and one wondered at times if his drunkenness was merely a performance that allowed people to excuse his worst impulses. \nThe same rules applied to the crew as a whole. The less that was known about the bandits - the more imperfect the information - the better their chance of survival. Their enemies would always hold the better cards. The only way to win was to bluff.\nIt's for this reason Casival was uneasy about the last job. They had purchased a building near a warehouse, tunneling into it and stealing the goods. The plan was solid and the profit healthy, but it was the target that worried him still, even now after it was complete. After all, unlike some enterprises, the &lt;a href=\"East%20Empire%20Company\"&gt;East Empire Company&lt;/a&gt; was a machine that counted every coin to its last, and weighed every commodity to the gram. Their employees were punctual, their accountants circumspect, and their ledgers pristine. They would identify precisely what goods were stolen, and investigate thoroughly the time and manner of the theft. \nThus it weighed heavy on his mind when the forger who purchased the building next to the warehouse had not responded to his last letter. Casival wrote the missive posing as a concerned relative, not wishing to betray any secrets lest the forger had been compromised. Another concern was news that the Company had enlisted the help of the local guard captains, in an effort to pool their information. With the added protection, caravans had been harder to sack. And with a more watchful eye on merchants, goods had been much harder to smuggle. As it turned out, it was possible to rob from the East Empire Company, but not without revealing some of their cards. \n\"Did you know that &lt;a href=\"Pale-Eyes%20%28Skyrim%20Creation%20Club%29\"&gt;Pale-Eyes&lt;/a&gt; can sing?\" Ehlhiel said, much to everyone's surprise.\n\"Is that a joke?\" asked Zaharia, somewhat surprised.\n\"I'm being serious, he's actually better than most bards,\" Ehlhiel replied, for once completely sincere, \"Trust me, it shocked me more than anything. I wasn't even aware Argonians could even make that kind of noise, let alone do it on key.\"\nCasival laughed at the thought of the shy Argonian melodically strumming his lute. Even after he thought he'd learned everything there was to know about the others, they were always surprising him in strange and interesting ways. Perhaps the same could be said about their current predicament. So long as they were free, it meant whatever information their pursuers had was still imperfect. \nThe bandits had revealed much of their cards already, but hopefully, they had yet to give away their entire hand."}

As he knelt to study the tracks, a hint of jazbay bloomed on his tongue, a side effect of the &lt;a href=\"Night%20Eye%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Night-Eye&lt;/a&gt; that the mages could not explain.\nThe tracks seemed to pause around a great oak tree, as if their owner had stopped to rethink his method of escape. Thumbing the crook of his chin, Aesrael listened for the footsteps of his fellow bandits, not wanting to turn his head. The assassin was close.\nHours prior, the night began with a toast. A courier had brought news of merchandise coming in from jobs in the &lt;a href=\"Colovian%20Highlands\"&gt;Highlands&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Gold%20Coast\"&gt;Gold Coast&lt;/a&gt;. It was the first sign of charity &lt;a href=\"Stendarr\"&gt;Stendarr&lt;/a&gt; had showed them in months, ever since the guard and the &lt;a href=\"East%20Empire%20Company\"&gt;East Empire Company&lt;/a&gt; had taken a special interest in squashing their operations. With all their leads dried up, the &lt;a href=\"The%20Crimson%20Dirks%20%28Faction%29\"&gt;Crimson Dirks&lt;/a&gt; were left to sacking caravans and petty thievery, the kind of work they were willing to do but always resented.\nHowever, with this latest news their coffers would be as full as their cups. In addition to obtaining a cache of valuables from a &lt;a href=\"Daedric\"&gt;Daedric&lt;/a&gt; cult, they had raided warehouses holding enchanted swords from &lt;a href=\"Anvil\"&gt;Anvil&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Colovian\"&gt;Colovian&lt;/a&gt; furs from &lt;a href=\"Chorrol\"&gt;Chorrol&lt;/a&gt;, along with crates of silks and fine robes weighted with perfume.\nIn order to launder the goods, the bandits, led by the &lt;a href=\"Dunmer%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Dunmer&lt;/a&gt; scribe &lt;a href=\"Casival\"&gt;Casival&lt;/a&gt;, made contact with a merchant noble, knowing he had connections across &lt;a href=\"Cyrodiil\"&gt;Cyrodiil&lt;/a&gt;. That night, they solidified the pact over a flask of wine and a gourmet feast. It was a landmark occasion for this group of rogues and misfits, to be legitimized in their dealings by a class above their own.\nAt that moment, the end of the Crimson Dirks might've seemed like the furthest thing from reality. Now, with Casival wounded and the merchant dead, it seemed almost inevitable.\n\"The trail ends here,\" Aesrael said, motioning to the trunk of the looming oak.\n\"Maybe the tree ate him,\" quipped the Bosmer, his Argonian partner &lt;a href=\"Pale-Eyes%20%28Skyrim%20Creation%20Club%29\"&gt;Pale-Eyes&lt;/a&gt; trailing behind him.\n\"You jest, &lt;a href=\"Ehlhiel\"&gt;Ehlhiel&lt;/a&gt;,\" replied Pale-Eyes, \"but in this one's village, there is a story of a Hist, corrupted by magic, that would kidnap and devour the hatchlings.\"\n\"Okay, I have to ask,\" the Bosmer replied, \"Why are there so many stories about monsters that eat children? Are parents so inept they have to constantly frighten their young into behaving, or are children really that delicious?\"\n\"I feel like as a Bosmer,\" countered the Argonian, \"you would know better than I.\"\n\"Quiet, you two,\" warned Aesrael, \"He's here.\"\nAesrael knew this was no time for banter. He could feel the taste of jazbay dim in his mouth. The Night-Eye would not last much longer, and when the spell snapped, their eyes would be ill-adjusted to the sudden darkness.\nThe assassin knew this as well. He had counted the seconds left in the spell and baited them to this point, where the long trees shrouded the moonlight. He had wagered on the fleeting light in the eyes of his pursuers, knowing his had yet to expire. He knew that blinded by the night, the Altmer would raise his hand and use the last of his magicka to recast the spell. And in that moment, he struck.\nThe assassin's dagger aimed for Aesrael's neck, slicing at the seam between his armor. He knew the Elf's left arm would be occupied by the spell casting, unable to guard his naked artery. And when he fell, the others would turn to his falling corpse, giving him ample distraction to kill them both. All of this seemed as academic as the death of the merchant, the one whom just hours ago they had failed to protect.\nAnd yet, inches away from its mark, his dagger was stopped cold. The assassin tried to wrestle it free, only to find it clenched in the &lt;a href=\"Altmer%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Altmer&lt;/a&gt;'s fist.\nIt was a feint. The Elf had raised his hand, but never cast the spell.\nDropping the dagger, the assassin leapt back, having given away his position for no more than a bloody hand. Aesrael and the others rushed to subdue him, but he was far too quick. With his remaining dagger, he slit his own throat, taking the secrets of his masters to the grave.\n\"So, who wants to explain this to the boss?\" Ehlhiel quipped, trying to lighten the mood, \"Because I've got a list of about thirty people I like to blame in situations like this.\"\n\"There are no words that can justify the depth of our failure,\" Aesrael grumbled, wrapping his wound, \"we lost the merchant and his killer. Casival is wounded. But perhaps, despite all this, we can learn something from the corpse.\"\n\"An assassin this skilled,\" remarked Pale-Eyes, \"must work for the East Empire Company.\"\n\"Worse,\" said Aesrael, examining the cut of his armor, \"it seems our merchant friend was dealing with more than just bandits, but the &lt;a href=\"Thalmor\"&gt;Thalmor&lt;/a&gt; as well. Because this man we killed isn't with the company. He's a Spectre.\"\nEhlhiel's face grew dim with the implication. It was one thing to make an enemy of the guards in the city, the East Empire Company, the Clan Mothers and even the Great Houses of Morrowind, but this was altogether different.\nIt was not the size or strength of their foe, but their knowledge they feared, and the &lt;a href=\"Penitus%20Oculatus\"&gt;Penitus Oculatus&lt;/a&gt; were spies of the highest order. If the &lt;a href=\"Third%20Empire\"&gt;Empire&lt;/a&gt; had been tracking the merchant's dealings, it was only a matter of time before their identities would be discovered and shared with all who opposed them.\nThe only question was, how much time was left."}

He'd heard women gasp, men cry, and children scream. Yet never in his life had he heard the noise that cascaded from the archways, when he plunged his sword into the belly of his assailant.\nApplause.\nWhen the crew disbanded, many of the Dirks were forced into the shadows, yet Urgnok's path took a different route. He met with a face butcher, adopted an alias, and joined the arena. And for the most part, the tactic seemed to work. These days, the only pursuers the &lt;a href=\"Orsimer%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Orc&lt;/a&gt; feared were the adoring fans that followed him in the street.\n\"I suggest you turn around now,\" Urgnok grumbled, seeing a shadow cut through the door, \"the last fan who annoyed me was this baker. He offered me a pastry, and I smashed his face in. Now he eats his sweet rolls through a straw.\"\n\"Funny,\" the shadow replied, \"I seem to recall a sparring session years ago that ended with you crying back to &lt;a href=\"Tyra%20Blood-Fire\"&gt;Tyra&lt;/a&gt; like a newborn babe.\"\n\"&lt;a href=\"Zaharia\"&gt;Zaharia&lt;/a&gt;. What are you doing here?\"\n\"I came to see our mutual Orc friend,\" the &lt;a href=\"Redguards%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Redguard&lt;/a&gt; said, examining a nearby weapon,\" I see you've already paid her a visit, judging by that armor. &lt;a href=\"Dwarven\"&gt;Dwarven&lt;/a&gt;, right? Although not exactly what I pictured.\"\nUrgnok spit at the ground, acknowledging what she left unspoken. The blacksmith was a magician with a hammer and anvil, working with all types of metal. Perhaps that was how the Redguard puzzled out his identity, yet it was unlikely a &lt;a href=\"Blood-Kin\"&gt;Blood-Kin&lt;/a&gt; would betray his confidence.\n\"You know, the funny thing about fighting styles,\" Zaharia said, swinging the practice blade, \"is that they're almost like fingerprints. You may have changed your armor, your name, and even your face, but I recognized that clumsy top foot of yours almost immediately.\"\n\"Doesn't matter,\" Urgnok sneered, \"The guard haven't sniffed me out yet, and they won't ever. I've been able to hide in plain sight, while everyone else is dying in the shadows.\"\n\"Hiding in plain sight may work in the short term,\" Zaharia said, sliding the weapon back onto the rack, \"But over time, you know what happens to things in plain sight? They get seen.\"\n\"Cut the crap, Zaharia,\" the Orc groused, \"we both know I don't care what you think.\"\n\"True,\" the Redguard replied, handing him a letter, \"but you'll care about this.\"\nUrgnok wasn't sure how he was discovered, or who wrote the letter to the guard. Had Zaharia not killed its bearer, he would already be in chains. He stopped short of accusing Zaharia of forging the note, however. She was crafty, but not a liar.\n\"Where.\"\n\"North,\" said the Redguard, \"Get into one of the &lt;a href=\"Orc%20Strongholds\"&gt;Strongholds&lt;/a&gt;, or take a job fighting in the pits. Either way, you can't stay here.\""}

Perhaps it was the time they stole a wagon's worth of silks from the desert palaces of &lt;a href=\"Dune\"&gt;Dune&lt;/a&gt;. Maybe it was when they burrowed a tunnel into the warehouse of the &lt;a href=\"East%20Empire%20Company\"&gt;East Empire Company&lt;/a&gt;, siphoning crate after crate while the wardens stood mindlessly at the door. Or it could be she preferred the more violent raids, like the sacking of the Argonian supply caravans, or the attacks on cargo ships leaving the &lt;a href=\"Imperial%20City\"&gt;Imperial City&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Imperial%20City%20Waterfront\"&gt;waterfront&lt;/a&gt;. \nOr perhaps if she looked back far enough, her fondest memories would find her in the streets of &lt;a href=\"Balmora\"&gt;Balmora&lt;/a&gt;, robbing travelers at knifepoint. For some reason it was this version of her, this long forgotten stranger, that seemed the most vivid now. Gone was the refined, thoughtful countenance of a leader, and in its place a hungry, ash-hewn child who had far more courage than sense. And if she closed her eyes, she could still feel the smooth, polished surface of the ruby the noble dropped in her palm, and how it felt like nothing of this world.\nYet it was not the price or the feel, but the color of the ruby that she remembered most; the blades of crimson burned into the glass, like the fire of the &lt;a href=\"Red%20Mountain\"&gt;Red Mountain&lt;/a&gt;. \n\"Why do you think it is,\" she asked &lt;a href=\"Aesrael\"&gt;Aesrael&lt;/a&gt;, \"that our thoughts turn to the past when are lives are so close to death?\"\n\"I suppose because it's pointless for a dead man to look forward,\" replied the bandit, his Altmer frame filling the breadth of her doorway, \"but I take it you didn't summon me to talk about old times.\"\n\"&lt;a href=\"Ehlhiel\"&gt;Ehlhiel&lt;/a&gt; says the city guard knows about the hideout. They plan to raid the place in three days.\"\n\"So they will,\" Aesrael replied, his face unflinching, \"What of the spoils?\"\n\"We can't take it with us,\" Tyra lamented, \"but I'll be damned if I let them have it. We give what we can to the beggars, and toss the rest into the bay before we leave.\" \n\"As you wish,\" said the High Elf, \"and where will you go?\"\n\"Our best chance is north,\" Tyra said, tracing her dagger up the map, \"The Jarls are fractured. It's only a matter of time before the whole province is at war. But we'll have to move in small groups, and find our own way once we cross the border. No contact.\"\nTyra knew Aesrael would take to the news better than the rest. While &lt;a href=\"Bjormund\"&gt;Bjormund&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Skjol\"&gt;Skjol&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Peladius\"&gt;Peladius&lt;/a&gt; were the muscle, they always made an effort to bond with the group. The High Elf, on the other hand, never felt at ease with the other bandits. If this were any other business, perhaps she would've tried to reach him, but tenderness was not a virtue for killers and thieves.\nAesrael nodded and took his leave, leaving Tyra alone in the quiet. If this exchange taught her anything, she still needed a moment before telling the others. She had always been an expert at masking her emotions, but the sadness wore plainly on her face. Perhaps this situation called for that girl from Balmora, and not the weary woman who sat in her stead.\nSteeling herself, Tyra placed the dirk and the ruby in her pouch and stepped away from the map. They would head for the border tomorrow, leaving behind much of their past, but the future still unwritten."}

They had no structure, organization, nor legacy. They had few tactics in the field and little design for the future. Worst of all they had no loyalty beyond filling their own pockets. A bandit clan was a pack of stray dogs fighting for scraps, willing to bite the hand if it dared to feed them.\nGrowing up in &lt;a href=\"Balmora\"&gt;Balmora&lt;/a&gt;, Tyra knew that the Great Houses of &lt;a href=\"Morrowind\"&gt;Morrowind&lt;/a&gt; were built on blood. Yet as an orphan child and a &lt;a href=\"Nord\"&gt;Nord&lt;/a&gt; amongst &lt;a href=\"Elves\"&gt;Elves&lt;/a&gt;, her concept of family was one forged from experience. It wasn't the bandits and cutthroats, but the loners and outcasts she identified with most. So when she picked out the crew that would become the &lt;a href=\"The%20Crimson%20Dirks%20%28Faction%29\"&gt;Crimson Dirks&lt;/a&gt;, she sought out the qualities that best defined herself.\nWhat she wanted were survivors.\nTo find them, she would first need connections. For this, she sought the help of a &lt;a href=\"Dark%20Elf\"&gt;Dark Elf&lt;/a&gt; named &lt;a href=\"Reaver%20%28The%20Crimson%20Dirks%29\"&gt;Reaver&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe Dunmer had no real name to speak of. Some speculated he was once a noble, having abandoned his titles and claims for a new one. Others believed he was with the &lt;a href=\"Morag%20Tong\"&gt;Morag Tong&lt;/a&gt;, assassins having little use for their birth name. Tyra, meanwhile, had first met the brigand as a child begging in the streets. The Dark Elf had fixed his blood red eyes upon this orphan girl, ashen and starved, and deigned to fill her alms bowl.\nWhen she looked down, she found neither food nor gold, but a knife.\n\"This isn't a gift, little netch,\" the Dunmer cautioned, throat scarred with ash, \"your first score belongs to me.\"\nThat night young Tyra would make good on that promise, delivering a single ruby into the &lt;a href=\"ashlander\"&gt;ashlander&lt;/a&gt;'s palm. It glowed crimson like fire and blood, and from that day she was known as Tyra Blood-Fire, earning her name just as Reaver did from his deeds. As the years passed, the Dunmer kept a close eye on the Nord, tracking her growth from a cutpurse to a bandit. And while she considered her debt to Reaver paid, whenever their paths crossed, he would continue to demand a cut.\nEight years later, and the two had gone their separate ways - not just in distance, but in spirit and mind. Tyra had matured into a tenacious warrior, her physique chiseled and rough, a body forged in a crucible of blood and ash. Reaver, on the other hand, had grown fat and lazy, content to skim off the labor of his subordinates while he spent his days in quiet repose.\nAs Tyra stood before him, he played with a ruby in his palm, occasionally using his forearm to wipe the saliva from his greasy lips. While Tyra recognized the gem almost immediately, the Dark Elf bared little resemblance to the vicious killer she once knew.\nPerhaps it was &lt;a href=\"Cyrodiil\"&gt;Cyrodiil&lt;/a&gt; that changed him. He had traded his netch leather for fine silks, his dagger for a silver spoon, and his ashland cave for a highborn residence in the heart of &lt;a href=\"Skingrad\"&gt;Skingrad&lt;/a&gt;. His scowl was not one of rage, but irritation, chiefly at his guest for tracking mud on his freshly waxed floors. Only the eyes, scarlet and piercing, betrayed his former identity.\n\"I'm new to &lt;a href=\"Cyrodiil\"&gt;Cyrodiil&lt;/a&gt;,\" she said, placing a bag of gold on the table as tithe, \"and I need a crew.\"\nThe Dunmer beckoned a servant to hand him the gold, as he could no longer be bothered to reach for it. He examined the bag briefly to judge its weight, before shooing the servant and the gold aside. Tyra wondered if she had been better served filling the bag with cakes.\n\"I will help you find these men,\" the Dunmer croaked, finger rapping the table, \"but remember, little netch, your first score belongs to me.\"\nOf men who fit her requirements, there were three. &lt;a href=\"Aesrael\"&gt;Aesrael&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"High%20Elf\"&gt;High Elf&lt;/a&gt; hunter, had grown up in an orphanage. &lt;a href=\"Peladius\"&gt;Peladius&lt;/a&gt; was a former guardsman, dismissed for beating a pickpocket to death. &lt;a href=\"Antonius\"&gt;Antonius&lt;/a&gt; was a hedge mage who spent more time at the tavern than the guild.\nThere were still others she wanted before the crew could be whole. She wanted a blacksmith to forge arms, and muscle to wield it. She wanted a thief who could stalk their prey in the shadows, and assassins to slit their throats. She wanted scouts to glean information, and sharp minds to decipher their code. And she was willing to travel the breadth of &lt;a href=\"Tamriel\"&gt;Tamriel&lt;/a&gt; to find them.\nBut for this first job, three was more than enough. One was all she needed. After all, she had already cased the building, having been invited as a guest. She had seen the servant girl deposit the gold in the next room, and the piles of riches scattered throughout the house. And she had watched as their plump, horker of an owner, lost his edge and taste for the work. For it was the reaver and all his riches that they would come for first.\nA week later, the three sealed their pact in blood. Aesrael and Peladius, being trained warriors, made quick work of the guards. Antonius bespelled the servants with his magic, and together the crew filled the wagons with their spoils.\nBut before all that was done, Tyra first found the once fearsome reaver in his bed chambers, helpless to stop what his greed had ordained.\nIn the shadow of a lantern's light, the Nord approached him with arms extended. In one hand was the bag of gold she had given him the week prior. In the other was the knife he had placed in her alms bowl so many years ago.\n\"I want you to have this,\" Reaver said, placing the ruby on the nightstand beside him. Tyra, for her part, never said a word.\n\"I wasn't always a reaver,\" the Dark Elf continued, \"I used to have a proper name. Casival, they called me. Funny story, there's a &lt;a href=\"Casival\"&gt;Dunmer boy&lt;/a&gt;, peddling for alms outside the &lt;a href=\"Two%20Sisters%20Lodge\"&gt;Two Sisters Lodge&lt;/a&gt; with the same name.\"\nUpon hearing his words, Tyra's eyes met Reaver's for the last time, standing over him as he once did her. Perhaps in that moment another deal was made, understood but left unspoken.\nSeconds later, she plunged the knife into his heart.\nWhen it was done, Tyra wiped the blood-stained dirk on the bedsheet and picked up the ruby from the . In the hours that passed the crew sacked the place clean, all save the bag of gold, which she left next to her former employer's corpse.\nThe first score, after all, belonged to him. The rest she took for herself.\n\"The Crimson Dirks, v2\".\nIn the year following its inception, the Crimson Dirks had more than tripled in size, and now numbered fifteen.\nTyra Blood-Fire had found her blacksmith in the &lt;a href=\"Imperial%20City\"&gt;Imperial City&lt;/a&gt;, an &lt;a href=\"Orc\"&gt;Orc&lt;/a&gt; named &lt;a href=\"Yakhtu%20gra-Orkulg\"&gt;Yakhtu&lt;/a&gt;. She had recruited cunning battlemages in the &lt;a href=\"Breton\"&gt;Breton&lt;/a&gt; twins, &lt;a href=\"Erwan\"&gt;Erwan&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Edward%20%28The%20Crimson%20Dirks%29\"&gt;Edward&lt;/a&gt;. In &lt;a href=\"Elsweyr\"&gt;Elsweyr&lt;/a&gt; she met &lt;a href=\"M%27Sharra\"&gt;M'Sharra&lt;/a&gt;, a street thief who had grown into a capable blade. There were the &lt;a href=\"Wood%20Elf\"&gt;Wood Elf&lt;/a&gt; archers, &lt;a href=\"Fathrys\"&gt;Fathrys&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Ehlhiel\"&gt;Ehlhiel&lt;/a&gt; - one a hopeless romantic, the other cynical beyond his years. There was the &lt;a href=\"Argonian\"&gt;Argonian&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Pale-Eyes%20%28Skyrim%20Creation%20Club%29\"&gt;Pale-Eyes&lt;/a&gt;, a loyal and true soul, and the &lt;a href=\"Redguard\"&gt;Redguard&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Zaharia\"&gt;Zaharia&lt;/a&gt;, a born leader of men. And lastly, she found her muscle in the Orc warrior &lt;a href=\"Urgnok\"&gt;Urgnok&lt;/a&gt;, and in the Nords &lt;a href=\"Skjol\"&gt;Skjol&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Bjormund\"&gt;Bjormund&lt;/a&gt;, their bodies as unbreakable as the ice of their ancestors.\nAltogether it had the makings of a full-fledged organization, rivaling that of any major guild. They had members pulling off jobs from &lt;a href=\"Bruma\"&gt;Bruma&lt;/a&gt; to &lt;a href=\"Dune\"&gt;Dune&lt;/a&gt;, raiding warehouses and pillaging farms. With every crate added to their coffers, Tyra hoped their influence could spider across the breadth of Tamriel, earning both fear and respect amongst those who plied their trade in the shadows.\nAs bandits, however, they would rely first and foremost on the sacking of caravans. They would stalk the highways and thoroughfares for carriages full of goods, and quickly relieve them of their belongings. For this task the Khajiit, M'Sharra, found herself best suited. Her eyes were keen at identifying a heavy wagon, from the spin of its wheels to the tracks carving through the dirt. She could spot a weary guard by the slump of his shoulders or the pace of his gait. Her eyes saw clearly even in the dead of night, while others were slaves to the light of their torches.\nAnd what she lacked in strength, the other bandits were willing to provide.\nOn this night, however, their victims put up little fight, their numbers comprised of monks and priests who were all too ready to unite with their makers. The wagon they plundered was destined for a temple, and its crates full of treasures that offered more tribute than gold.\n\"Do you think Tyra would like this?\" asked M'Sharra, popping her head out from behind the wagon, an &lt;a href=\"Amulet%20of%20Talos\"&gt;Amulet of Talos&lt;/a&gt; dangling from her ear.\n\"A bandit has no need for gods or prayer,\" grumbled Urgnok, wiping the blood from his battleaxe, \"it's a terrible gift.\"\n\"Nonsense,\" countered Bjormund, unloading a crate, \"all Nords love &lt;a href=\"Talos\"&gt;Talos&lt;/a&gt;, almost as much as they love mead!\"\n\"Of course you would say that, frost licker,\" snarled Urgnok, \"but by &lt;a href=\"Malacath\"&gt;Malacath&lt;/a&gt;, Tyra is not like the rest of you idiots. She has taste.\"\nIf Tyra were like any other Nord, Urgnok would have never pledged her his axe. In his mind, the Nords were pale-faced, poetry loving giants who ate with their fingers and drank from a horn. Tyra, however, did not think or feel or smell like the other Nords did, and more importantly, did not fight like them. She preferred the acrid bite of a &lt;a href=\"sujamma\"&gt;sujamma&lt;/a&gt; bottle to a snowback's &lt;a href=\"Mead\"&gt;honeyed drink&lt;/a&gt;, and despised poetry in all its forms. He surmised she might've been from Morrowind, but the Orc was not the type to pry into another's business.\n\"Oh?\" said M'Sharra with a mischievous grin, the amulet swaying as her ears perked up, \"and what are you planning to get her, Urgnok?\"\n\"What? Why would I get her anything?\" the Orc replied coldly, \"you'll all be dead in a year anyway.\"\nM'Sharra blanched at the words, unsure if the Orc was making a joke or speaking prophecy. While hardly a mage, Urgnok was known to dabble in dark magic, wearing tribal scars and marks on his body, and totems of bone around his neck. Unlike with the blacksmith Yakhtu, his anger seemed to stem not from the hardened nature of his blood, but something deeper and personal, and it colored every conversation they had. The others stewed in silence at his remarks until the young Bosmer, Fathrys, broke the ice.\n\"Speaking of which, did you want anything for the holidays, Zaharia?\" he mewled, a rose of blush affecting his soft brown skin. The Redguard, in return, paid him little heed as she examined the wagon's horses.\n\"If you want to get me a &lt;a href=\"Saturalia\"&gt;Saturalia&lt;/a&gt; gift,\" said Zaharia, pointing at the arrows lodged in the wagon's side, \"work on your aim. I'll feel better about having you at my back when you can kill more than planks of wood.\"\n\"That is all well and good,\" interrupted M'Sharra, \"but there is a far more important matter than life and death, for this Khajiit still does not have a suitable present.\"\n\"If it's from the heart,\" Fathrys said, eyes fixated on the Redguard, \"the amulet will be good enough.\"\nTwo weeks later on a cold Saturalia night, Tyra Blood-Fire awoke to the sound of a crackling fire. A note was placed on her private safe, which she opened to find an amulet wrapped in cloth. The Khajiit had snuck into her room earlier and left the gift and the fire behind, as proof of both her generosity and skill.\nTyra was not religious by nature, but as she stood in that warm, reddish glow, something about the Amulet of Talos resonated with her. Perhaps it was the letter she received from Peladius that morning, about an encounter with the Thalmor in Dune. In that instance, a thought crept into her mind and soon blossomed into an idea. The following day she beckoned the blacksmith to her chambers, the idea having matured into a plan.\n\"I want you to forge me more of these amulets,\" Tyra said, placing the axe-shaped necklace on the table before her.\nThe blacksmith picked up the artifact and studied its make, thumbing across the intricate patterns grooved into the piece. Unlike other amulets, it was simple yet ornate, its blades casting a neutral tone that neither reflected nor absorbed the surrounding candlelight.\n\"This is made with &lt;a href=\"Dragon%20Bone\"&gt;dragonbone&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Dragon%20Scales\"&gt;scales&lt;/a&gt;,\" Yakhtu replied, \"hard to come by these days, but a replica should be simple enough. I guess my only question is, why? Seems odd for bandits to turn to the &lt;a href=\"Divines\"&gt;Divines&lt;/a&gt; for help.\"\n\"Last week, there was a trade caravan traveling on the Silver Road, torched by &lt;a href=\"Thalmor\"&gt;Thalmor&lt;/a&gt; Justiciars,\" Tyra said, \"Apparently they killed the merchant on suspicion of Talos worship. And it's not just here. I've gotten word from Peladius that the Thalmor are making an effort to eliminate anyone and everyone in possession of these amulets, whether it be men in the streets or wagons on the road.\"\n\"Wagons,\" replied Yakhtu, \"like the ones we sack.\"\n\"Exactly. The amulets aren't armor or jewelry or tribute,\" said Tyra, \"they're a motive. We place one on every caravan we sack, and torch the wagons when we're done looting them. The guards blame the Thalmor, and we keep the spoils.\"\nYakhtu nodded and took her leave, mind set on forging the amulets. Tyra knew well enough that the smith didn't need the artifact with her, having already committed it to memory. The blacksmith's genius was different from the others - quiet, removed, and matched only by her insatiable work ethic. The amulets would be done by daybreak, and there was no need for this one to be included.\nTyra returned the amulet to the safe, when she noticed another item nestled amongst the piles of gold and gems. It was the tooth of an Orc chief, one typically earned by besting its owner in single combat.\nTyra herself knew of one such Orc, a son who had been forced to kill his father against his will. Heartbroken, the son wore this tooth as a keepsake around his neck, fearing the day he would have to slay his future children. Until one day the son met a Nord bandit, who became &lt;a href=\"Blood-Kin\"&gt;Blood-Kin&lt;/a&gt; of the tribe and challenged him to a duel.\nThe bandit bested the Orc in single combat, and recognizing the pain that haunted him, freed him from his duties as chief. She asked not for his tooth, but his blade when the time came. Yet it wasn't until after the Nord formed the Crimson Dirks that she returned to that Orc, and asked him to make good on his oath.\nTyra smiled as she recalled the memory. She didn't know Urgnok had pulled the tooth, but it didn't surprise her in the least.\n\"The Crimson Dirks, v3\".\nPeladius looked outside the window of the Crescent Moons Inn, watching the patrons below shuffle through the market sands. A Nord butcher, catching his glance, waved hello to the &lt;a href=\"Imperial\"&gt;Imperial&lt;/a&gt;, before returning to his trade.\nAt the table behind him, Erwan and Edward were with the buyer, playing an old Khajiit game of tiles and bones; a fool's wager given they barely understood the rules.\nAs the septims slowly poured over to the Khajiit's end of the table, Peladius' thoughts turned to his friends back in Cyrodiil, and prayed to &lt;a href=\"Zenithar\"&gt;Zenithar&lt;/a&gt; that luck had found them in their part of the world.\n\"If Khajiit may ask,\" he said, adding an ante, \"this merchandise you wish to move, is it by chance connected to the recent theft in the palace?\"\n\"Khajiit may not ask,\" snapped Erwan, \"or Erwan will remove his tongue.\"\n\"Pardon his rudeness,\" the cat demurred, \"but the sands are full of talk regarding the heist of the Clan Mother's treasury.\"\n\"Oh, give him a break,\" teased Edward, \"if you wanted to hide your identity, you probably should've chosen a disguise that didn't include the Clan Mother's personal wardrobe.\"\nErwan scowled at her brother, angry at herself for not having a proper comeback. The Khajiit, meanwhile, glanced at his tiles and fiddled with his ring, an action that did not go unnoticed.\n\"Yes, although it was not the silk, but the sword that gave her away,\" the Khajiit said, revealing another winning hand, \"a common blade would not have such an elegant scabbard.\"\n\"We should drop the weapons and just grow our nails out,\" Edward sighed, as the cat's claws raked in another pot, \"maybe then we'd have better luck.\"\n\"If you want to take that risk, be my guest,\" Peladius chimed in, \"but if we get into a fight, I'd feel better if my hands were clutching Imperial steel.\"\n\"You'd feel better, sure!\" Edward countered, \"But how do I know I wasn't destined to be a mage?\"\nThere was a time when Peladius wondered the same about Edward. At first glance he was more dashing noble than thief, but behind the smile and charm was a cunning and calculating wit. Some might argue that Edward was better suited for the job than Peladius could ever be. For the best rogues cut their enemies not with the edge of their dagger, but the sharpness of their mind.\n\"Either way, Khajiit is excited to meet such daring thieves. How many outsiders would even try such a thing, given the consequences?\"\n\"What do you mean by that?\" Edward replied, examining his tiles.\n\"Well, the Clan Mothers are allies of the &lt;a href=\"Aldmeri%20Dominion%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Dominion&lt;/a&gt;. Their eyes are all-seeing, and their punishments are known to all who hear the screams.\"\n\"And what do you think about that, furball?\" Erwan interrupted, eyes focused on the Khajiit, \"are you a fan of the Dominion? Do you have paintings at home of &lt;a href=\"Lady%20Arannelya\"&gt;Lady Arannelya&lt;/a&gt; in fancy lace?\"\n\"Khajiit does not care for politics,\" he said, raising the pot, \"He is sorry to have brought it up.\"\n\"Oh, don't mind my sister, she's just touched by Sheogorath,\" replied Edward, calling the bet, \"I, for one, love a good political discussion. It allows us to find a common ground. After all, why do you think people get into conflicts in the first place?\"\n\"Khajiit would assume it is because two sides cannot reconcile their differences.\"\n\"You'd think that. One person calls Talos a man, and the other a god, and the next thing you know, they're at each other's throats. But I've seen blood feuds started over the love of a woman, and wars fought over inches on a map.\nThe truth is, people don't fight because they're different. They fight because their motivations are one and the same. That's true whether you're the &lt;a href=\"Third%20Empire\"&gt;Empire&lt;/a&gt; and the Thalmor, or a Clan Mother and a thief.\"\n\"And what, by the moons, unites you and the Clan Mother? What is this motivation you both share?\"\n\"The same thing that drives you,\" Edward smiled, laying out his tiles on the table.\n\"Greed.\"\nThe hand was indeed a winner, but of greater concern to the Khajiit was the note Edward placed beside it. The merchant recognized it immediately. He had penned the letter that morning, with the intent to betray them to the Clan Mother in exchange for a hefty sum of sugar and gold.\nStartled, he reached for his weapon, but it was too late. Erwan had already drawn hers.\n\"It doesn't matter,\" the Khajiit merchant said, \"this letter was for the Clan Mother. But the one to the guard is already-\"\nBefore Edward could interject, Erwan slit the Khajiit's throat.\nAs the blood splattered all over her silk garment, a scream could be heard from the market. A Thalmor Justiciar, flanked by two guards, had dragged the Nord butcher from his stall, accusing him Talos worship.\nThe Justiciar tore open the butcher's tunic, but found only an &lt;a href=\"Amulet%20of%20Mara\"&gt;Amulet of Mara&lt;/a&gt;. The butcher replied with a toothy grin, asking the Thalmor if she was spoken for. The Justiciar, digusted, tossed the butcher into his stall before returning to her patrol.\nPeladius shut the window. They may have won the day, but the war was another story. For now, they had a long journey ahead of them, and a body to dispose.\n\"The Crimson Dirks, v4\".\nThe tavern fell into silence. Casival squinted at the young Bosmer, trying to get a read on his mood. Just hours earlier the lad had embarked on the biggest quest of his life, the kind of endeavor that turns squires into warriors, boys into men.\n\"Well, what did she say?\" he asked the young bandit.\n\"She said she would only wed me,\" Fathrys said, \"if I brought her the scale of a dragon.\"\nThe tavern burst into laughter, patrons smacking their tankards against the wood.\n\"What?\" Fathrys replied, clearly confused, \"What's so funny?\"\n\"I'm sorry lad,\" said Casival, \"but I think that's her way of saying 'No.'\"\nFathrys was crestfallen. It had taken nearly all of his courage to confess his love to Zaharia. What meager defenses remained in his youthful frame, Casival could not guess, but they stood little chance against this latest assault. In fact, with each passing second Fathrys' shoulders slumped further and further into his chest, until he was more Guar than man. Taking pity, Casival decided to massage the boy's ego with a tale of his first rejection, when a familiar voice croaked at the pair from across the room.\n\"A dragon scale, you say?\"\nNot a soul had realized Antonius was in the tavern, mostly because the bandit mage was a permanent fixture. From dusk to dawn he teetered upon his wobbly chair, drinking all manner of spirits by his lonesome. Over time he began to blend into the scenery, like an odor that only strangers could smell.\n\"By the Nine, do you know where I can find one?\" Fathrys beamed with shoulders out, his once gloomy face resurrected with life.\n\"I'm a wizard, am I not?\" Antonius said, before letting out a dignified belch.\n\"A bandit wizard,\" Casival interjected, \"and with all due respect to you and your profession, I don't think you're helping.\"\n\"Nonsense, Casival,\" scolded the mage, nearly tripping over his own feet as he sat at the table, \"The boy needs a dragon scale, and I aim to help him find one.\"\n\"But the dragons have been extinct for centuries upon centuries,\" Casival said.\n\"You really are a bad student,\" scoffed Antonius, jabbing his finger into the Dunmer's forehead, \"this is why Tyra favors Edward over you. At least he pays attention.\"\n\"Forgive me, mage.\"\n\"Only the Divines can forgive you, my son. Drink this bottle, and it'll take you to them.\"\n\"What about the dragon scale?\" Fathrys whined, growing impatient.\n\"Oh right, that. Well, it just so happens, there's an old Nord legend about a warrior named &lt;a href=\"Ulfnir%20Bone-Skin\"&gt;Ulfnir Bone-Skin&lt;/a&gt;,\" Antonius explained, flecks of spit flying out of his mouth, \"who slew the serpent wyrm &lt;a href=\"Vithrelnaak\"&gt;Vithrelnaak&lt;/a&gt; and fashioned a powerful &lt;a href=\"Studded%20Dragonscale%20Armor\"&gt;armor&lt;/a&gt; from his scales. When he died, instead of giving his armor away to his ungrateful pupils, he did what any self-respecting warrior would do, and buried himself with it.\"\n\"Well, that's too bad,\" said Casival, hoping to derail this runaway carriage, \"surely it would've been emptied out by grave robbers by now.\"\n\"You would think,\" Antonius screamed, raising his voice for no reason, \"but they say Ulfnir's corpse haunts the barrow near &lt;a href=\"Yorgrim%20Overlook\"&gt;Yorgrim's Overlook&lt;/a&gt;, and kills anyone who dares try and take his armor.\"\n\"I see! So it's a challenge!\" Fathrys exclaimed, \"In order to wear Ulfnir's armor, one must first best him as a warrior!\"\n\"Either that, or he just doesn't want some random stranger wearing his clothes. How would you feel if I showed up to your home wearing your undergarments? But yes, you kill Ulfnir, you get your dragon scale. You get your dragon scale, and you get your wench.\"\n\"She's not a wench. She's the most amazing woman in all of &lt;a href=\"Mundus\"&gt;Mundus&lt;/a&gt;, and I'm going to marry her!\"\n\"Sure, whatever.\"\nCasival breathed a deep sigh as Fathrys' heart grew ill with hope. The only saving grace was that Windhelm was thousands of leagues away, and Fathrys was still a pup. Perhaps when he was ready for the work, a word or two with Tyra could send him further away still. Yet whatever remedy he devised would be temporary. He had seen that look too many times to deny what would come next.\nA fortnight later, Casival returned to the tavern. It was the same as it ever was, for the most part. The wenches tended to the patrons, and the patrons to their stress. The bards sang tales old and new, and the drunkards, not knowing the lyrics, still saw fit to join them. Antonius was perched in the corner as always, a bottle in each hand and several more on the ground.\nIt was like any other Fredas, save for the empty seat beside him.\nHe would break the news to Tyra in the morning. The Bosmer would not return.\n\"The Crimson Dirks, v5\".\nErwan was convinced the ring was cursed.\nAt first, the proof came in small doses. There were bad streaks at the card table, sudden pain in her tooth, and stale bottles of mead. Soon, the proof took on a larger, more dangerous form. Her blade would miss its mark. Potions would cure too slowly. Or she'd step on a rune that her barbarian companion, Skjol, had no business skipping over.\nThen there was the greater proof, the instances that threatened their livelihood. There was the coin drying up, new guard patrols at the usual haunts, and word that the &lt;a href=\"East%20Empire%20Company\"&gt;East Empire Company&lt;/a&gt; had taken notice of their works. All told it augured a slow, tumbling march toward the end of the Crimson Dirks.\nKnowing this, a smart person might've cast it out; tossed the foul ring into the heart of &lt;a href=\"Illiac%20Bay\"&gt;Illiac Bay&lt;/a&gt; and let the waves ferry it to forgotten shores. A wise person might've taken it a step further, destroying the artifact and its ill-fated magic, so that no person, past or present, would ever come to harm.\nErwan, of course, decided to wear it around her neck.\nWith regard to the ring's nature, she told only the barbarian. Her brother Edward would refuse to believe her. The others would demand she get rid of it, in whatever manner best fit their inclinations. Skjol, on the other hand, would neither object nor disapprove.\nWhenever she confided in him, Skjol would simply stare at her blankly and let out a guttural snort before chewing on the nearest piece of meat. Skjol, after all, was not just a barbarian, but one who wore that label like a badge, or an honor bestowed upon him by the High King. Of words he knew few, and when he wrote them down, rarely did he put them in the right order. The only thng that spared him from further ignominy was the fact he couldn't speak.\nAs the story goes, the leader of the Crimson Dirks, Tyra Blood-Fire, found him in a cage with his tongue removed, and upon freeing him gained his axe. To this day it was never clear if Skjol was loyal to her or the crew, or whether that distinction had any meaning to him. If Tyra asked him to back Erwan on a job, he would do so without question, and absorb whatever secrets, insults, and curses the Breton decided to fling in his general direction.\nThat theory would be tested the moment she stepped on that rune.\nEarlier that week, they had received a tip. A new crew had set up a smuggler's operation in one of the old ruins outside the capital. It was supposed to be a simple task. They were to meet with the clan leaders, flex their muscle, and come home with new members or a percentage of the take. It all would've gone according to script, Erwan thought, had the ring not been cursed.\n\"This is all your fault,\" she said to no one in particular, while glaring at her disobedient hands. Moments earlier, the Breton had awoken to the sound of chanting - a low and ominous moan floating through the chamber. The rune had blurred her sight, but it was the haunting refrain that seemed to dull her focus, unable to cast a spell.\nRegardless, it was clear their captors were more than smugglers. Erwan didn't need to see the source of the chanting to know it was bad business, no matter how long Skjol mindlessly pointed in that direction.\n\"Well, at least it isn't cannibals,\" Erwan sneered, \"although you being a choking hazard might've worked in our favor.\"\nSkjol wasn't the brightest Nord, but he knew when he was being insulted. In a past life, he would've simply crushed Erwan's skull and taken a nap. Moreover, cages were nothing new to him, and Erwan's noisy jests were to him, signs of panic. But he had sworn a vow to protect the charges of the one they called Blood-Fire, and so rather than kill the Breton for looking at him oddly, Skjol continued to point, much to Erwan's confusion.\nThe shrine behind her was &lt;a href=\"Daedric\"&gt;Daedric&lt;/a&gt; in origin - large, twisted and barbed, its stems ugly and misshapen. Blood dripped from its ebony thorns, spilling past the cage and down the stone steps like shifting roots. At the base of the steps stood robed cultists, lost in their supplication, flanked by guards dressed in &lt;a href=\"Daedric%20armor\"&gt;Daedric armor&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Daedric%20Mail%20Armor%20%28Skyrim%20Creation%20Club%29\"&gt;mail&lt;/a&gt;. Despite an open roof, the air in the ruins was thick and noxious, and the shrine seemed to throb in the blood moon's light.\nAs the light shone on the altar, the cultist chants began to turn more vehement and forceful. The voices continued to rise, louder and louder, until one of the guards broke from his stance, climbing the steps toward the cage. Seeing this, Erwan bared her teeth and snarled at him like an animal, but he continued his approach undeterred. As the chants hit a crescendo, Erwan could no longer hear her own thoughts, seeing nothing save the cold, black gauntlet split through the bars and reach for her neck.\nWith a thrust the guard grabbed her by the head and slammed her into the bars, drawing his weapon with his other hand. With spit bubbling from her mouth and her body pressed against the iron, Erwan screamed at Skjol every manner of insult she could contrive. But the oaf continued to sit in place, his finger still extended, even as the cultists' chant drummed against their ears. Only now the finger was pointed to the ground, tracing a circle.\nErwan looked down and saw the ring, glowing hotly on her chest.\nSkjol didn't need to tell her what to do next. She wrung herself free of the guard's grasp, and not knowing what would happen, placed the ring on her finger.\nThe chanting stopped. And in its place, the shrill cry of weapons drawn from their scabbards. The Daedric warrior turned his attention to the cultists, but it was too late. Erwan's spell of hysteria had taken hold, her focus restored by the power of the ring. One by one the cultists turned on each other, their rage driven by hers. And when the clangs of metal faded and the screams turned to silence, Erwan collapsed, having exhausted all of herself and the ring.\nAs the hours passed into the day, Erwan lay there on the floor of her cage, letting the sun splash through the bars. Skjol snored softly in his corner, shifting on occasion to scratch himself. Outside, ravens picked at the flesh of the dead, sharpening their beaks on the bones and paying no mind to the living.\nThe others would come looking for them eventually, and fetch M'Sharra to pick the lock. But for now Erwan was content as she was. She held the ring up against the sky, circling the area where the moon once stood. Perhaps she had made a mistake, and the ring wasn't cursed after all.\nBut Erwan still held out hope.\n\"The Crimson Dirks, v6\".\nEdward taught Antonius the game he learned in Elsweyr, as Casival, Ehlhiel and Zaharia joined them at the table. A cloth, stained with every conceivable color of wine and spirit, was placed over the top of the wood, allowing the bones and tiles to slide across its otherwise splintered face. While some of the rules were lost in translation, Edward knew enough for the game to function. Moreover, if he were to bend said rules to his favor, his opponents would be none the wiser.\n\"There are two types of games,\" Edward explained, laying the tiles out on the surface, \"those with perfect information, and those that are imperfect. Chess, for example, is a game with perfect information. We know each other's pieces and their placement on the board. Card games, on the other hand, are of the imperfect variety. We are each dealt a hand with a set value, and must divine, through whatever means are available to us, who has the better of it.\"\n\"And which type do you prefer?\" asked Casival.\n\"I prefer to know who and what I'm dealing with,\" replied Edward, \"but at the same time, I know the more practical skill is to play games where the information is imperfect. After all, that is how the world around us is played.\"\n\"I wasn't aware life was a game,\" said Ehlhiel, \"because if so, I need to find a better way to cheat.\"\n\"Don't be so modest,\" replied Edward, raking in another pot, \"I think you're doing just fine. The same can't be said for our friend Antonius here.\"\n\"I only lost because you distracted me,\" barked Antonius, \"with that inhaling and exhaling thing you do with your nose.\"\n\"Do you mean breathing?\" asked Edward.\n\"Yes, that.\"\nAs a careful study of others, Casival understood the gist of Edward's speech. There were layers beyond what faces advertised. Edward, for instance, used his charm and intellect like a sword, his sly demeanor having a purpose that disarmed his opponents. Ehlhiel, on the other hand, wore his humor like armor, deflecting any inkling of emotion or motive. Zaharia, for all her straightforwardness, was also passionate and sincere, making her prone to falling victim to her temper. Even Antonius, for all his inebriation, was a skilled hedge mage, and one wondered at times if his drunkenness was merely a performance that allowed people to excuse his worst impulses.\nThe same rules applied to the crew as a whole. The less that was known about the bandits - the more imperfect the information - the better their chance of survival. Their enemies would always hold the better cards. The only way to win was to bluff.\nIt's for this reason Casival was uneasy about the last job. They had purchased a building near a warehouse, tunneling into it and stealing the goods. The plan was solid and the profit healthy, but it was the target that worried him still, even now after it was complete. After all, unlike some enterprises, the East Empire Company was a machine that counted every coin to its last, and weighed every commodity to the gram. Their employees were punctual, their accountants circumspect, and their ledgers pristine. They would identify precisely what goods were stolen, and investigate thoroughly the time and manner of the theft.\nThus it weighed heavy on his mind when the forger who purchased the building next to the warehouse had not responded to his last letter. Casival wrote the missive posing as a concerned relative, not wishing to betray any secrets lest the forger had been compromised. Another concern was news that the Company had enlisted the help of the local guard captains, in an effort to pool their information. With the added protection, caravans had been harder to sack. And with a more watchful eye on merchants, goods had been much harder to smuggle. As it turned out, it was possible to rob from the East Empire Company, but not without revealing some of their cards.\n\"Did you know that Pale-Eyes can sing?\" Ehlhiel said, much to everyone's surprise.\n\"Is that a joke?\" asked Zaharia, somewhat surprised.\n\"I'm being serious, he's actually better than most bards,\" Ehlhiel replied, for once completely sincere, \"Trust me, it shocked me more than anything. I wasn't even aware Argonians could even make that kind of noise, let alone do it on key.\"\nCasival laughed at the thought of the shy Argonian melodically strumming his lute. Even after he thought he'd learned everything there was to know about the others, they were always surprising him in strange and interesting ways. Perhaps the same could be said about their current predicament. So long as they were free, it meant whatever information their pursuers had was still imperfect.\nThe bandits had revealed much of their cards already, but hopefully, they had yet to give away their entire hand.\n\"The Crimson Dirks, v7\".\nThe assassin's trail stretched further into the woods. Aesrael took the lead, with the Argonian and the Bosmer in close pursuit, following the thread of tangled brush and loose mud. As he knelt to study the tracks, a hint of &lt;a href=\"Jazbay%20Grapes\"&gt;jazbay&lt;/a&gt; bloomed on his tongue, a side effect of the &lt;a href=\"Night-Eye\"&gt;Night-Eye&lt;/a&gt; that the mages could not explain.\nThe tracks seemed to pause around a great oak tree, as if their owner had stopped to rethink his method of escape. Thumbing the crook of his chin, Aesrael listened for the footsteps of his fellow bandits, not wanting to turn his head. The assassin was close.\nHours prior, the night began with a toast. A courier had brought news of merchandise coming in from jobs in the &lt;a href=\"Colovian%20Highlands\"&gt;Highlands&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Gold%20Coast\"&gt;Gold Coast&lt;/a&gt;. It was the first sign of charity &lt;a href=\"Stendarr\"&gt;Stendarr&lt;/a&gt; had showed them in months, ever since the guard and the East Empire Company had taken a special interest in squashing their operations. With all their leads dried up, the Crimson Dirks were left to sacking caravans and petty thievery, the kind of work they were willing to do but always resented.\nHowever, with this latest news their coffers would be as full as their cups. In addition to obtaining a cache of valuables from a Daedric cult, they had raided warehouses holding enchanted swords from &lt;a href=\"Anvil\"&gt;Anvil&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Colovian\"&gt;Colovian&lt;/a&gt; furs from &lt;a href=\"Chorrol\"&gt;Chorrol&lt;/a&gt;, along with crates of silks and fine robes weighted with perfume.\nIn order to launder the goods, the bandits, led by the Dunmer scribe Casival, made contact with a merchant noble, knowing he had connections across Cyrodiil. That night, they solidified the pact over a flask of wine and a gourmet feast. It was a landmark occasion for this group of rogues and misfits, to be legitimized in their dealings by a class above their own.\nAt that moment, the end of the Crimson Dirks might've seemed like the furthest thing from reality. Now, with Casival wounded and the merchant dead, it seemed almost inevitable.\n\"The trail ends here,\" Aesrael said, motioning to the trunk of the looming oak.\n\"Maybe the tree ate him,\" quipped the Bosmer, his Argonian partner Pale-Eyes trailing behind him.\n\"You jest, Ehlhiel,\" replied Pale-Eyes, \"but in this one's village, there is a story of a &lt;a href=\"Hist\"&gt;Hist&lt;/a&gt;, corrupted by magic, that would kidnap and devour the hatchlings.\"\n\"Okay, I have to ask,\" the Bosmer replied, \"Why are there so many stories about monsters that eat children? Are parents so inept they have to constantly frighten their young into behaving, or are children really that delicious?\"\n\"I feel like as a Bosmer,\" countered the Argonian, \"you would know better than I.\"\n\"Quiet, you two,\" warned Aesrael, \"He's here.\"\nAesrael knew this was no time for banter. He could feel the taste of jazbay dim in his mouth. The Night-Eye would not last much longer, and when the spell snapped, their eyes would be ill-adjusted to the sudden darkness.\nThe assassin knew this as well. He had counted the seconds left in the spell and baited them to this point, where the long trees shrouded the moonlight. He had wagered on the fleeting light in the eyes of his pursuers, knowing his had yet to expire. He knew that blinded by the night, the Altmer would raise his hand and use the last of his magicka to recast the spell. And in that moment, he struck.\nThe assassin's dagger aimed for Aesrael's neck, slicing at the seam between his armor. He knew the Elf's left arm would be occupied by the spell casting, unable to guard his naked artery. And when he fell, the others would turn to his falling corpse, giving him ample distraction to kill them both. All of this seemed as academic as the death of the merchant, the one whom just hours ago they had failed to protect.\nAnd yet, inches away from its mark, his dagger was stopped cold. The assassin tried to wrestle it free, only to find it clenched in the Altmer's fist.\nIt was a feint. The Elf had raised his hand, but never cast the spell.\nDropping the dagger, the assassin leapt back, having given away his position for no more than a bloody hand. Aesrael and the others rushed to subdue him, but he was far too quick. With his remaining dagger, he slit his own throat, taking the secrets of his masters to the grave.\n\"So, who wants to explain this to the boss?\" Ehlhiel quipped, trying to lighten the mood, \"Because I've got a list of about thirty people I like to blame in situations like this.\"\n\"There are no words that can justify the depth of our failure,\" Aesrael grumbled, wrapping his wound, \"we lost the merchant and his killer. Casival is wounded. But perhaps, despite all this, we can learn something from the corpse.\"\n\"An assassin this skilled,\" remarked Pale-Eyes, \"must work for the East Empire Company.\"\n\"Worse,\" said Aesrael, examining the cut of his armor, \"it seems our merchant friend was dealing with more than just bandits, but the Thalmor as well. Because this man we killed isn't with the company. He's a Spectre.\"\nEhlhiel's face grew dim with the implication. It was one thing to make an enemy of the guards in the city, the East Empire Company, the Clan Mothers and even the Great Houses of Morrowind, but this was altogether different.\nIt was not the size or strength of their foe, but their knowledge they feared, and the &lt;a href=\"Penitus%20Oculatus\"&gt;Penitus Oculatus&lt;/a&gt; were spies of the highest order. If the Empire had been tracking the merchant's dealings, it was only a matter of time before their identities would be discovered and shared with all who opposed them.\nThe only question was, how much time was left.\n\"The Crimson Dirks, v8\".\nIn his time with the Crimson Dirks, Urgnok had killed countless men, and heard all manner of reaction to their deaths. He'd heard women gasp, men cry, and children scream. Yet never in his life had he heard the noise that cascaded from the archways, when he plunged his sword into the belly of his assailant.\nApplause.\nWhen the crew disbanded, many of the Dirks were forced into the shadows, yet Urgnok's path took a different route. He met with a face butcher, adopted an alias, and joined the arena. And for the most part, the tactic seemed to work. These days, the only pursuers the Orc feared were the adoring fans that followed him in the street.\n\"I suggest you turn around now,\" Urgnok grumbled, seeing a shadow cut through the door, \"the last fan who annoyed me was this baker. He offered me a pastry, and I smashed his face in. Now he eats his sweet rolls through a straw.\"\n\"Funny,\" the shadow replied, \"I seem to recall a sparring session years ago that ended with you crying back to Tyra like a newborn babe.\"\n\"Zaharia. What are you doing here?\"\n\"I came to see our mutual Orc friend,\" the Redguard said, examining a nearby weapon,\" I see you've already paid her a visit, judging by that armor. &lt;a href=\"Dwarven\"&gt;Dwarven&lt;/a&gt;, right? Although not exactly what I pictured.\"\nUrgnok spit at the ground, acknowledging what she left unspoken. The blacksmith was a magician with a hammer and anvil, working with all types of metal. Perhaps that was how the Redguard puzzled out his identity, yet it was unlikely a Blood-Kin would betray his confidence.\n\"You know, the funny thing about fighting styles,\" Zaharia said, swinging the practice blade, \"is that they're almost like fingerprints. You may have changed your armor, your name, and even your face, but I recognized that clumsy top foot of yours almost immediately.\"\n\"Doesn't matter,\" Urgnok sneered, \"The guard haven't sniffed me out yet, and they won't ever. I've been able to hide in plain sight, while everyone else is dying in the shadows.\"\n\"Hiding in plain sight may work in the short term,\" Zaharia said, sliding the weapon back onto the rack, \"But over time, you know what happens to things in plain sight? They get seen.\"\n\"Cut the crap, Zaharia,\" the Orc groused, \"we both know I don't care what you think.\"\n\"True,\" the Redguard replied, handing him a letter, \"but you'll care about this.\"\nUrgnok wasn't sure how he was discovered, or who wrote the letter to the guard. Had Zaharia not killed its bearer, he would already be in chains. He stopped short of accusing Zaharia of forging the note, however. She was crafty, but not a liar.\n\"Where.\"\n\"North,\" said the Redguard, \"Get into one of the &lt;a href=\"Orc%20Strongholds\"&gt;Strongholds&lt;/a&gt;, or take a job fighting in the pits. Either way, you can't stay here.\"\n\"The Crimson Dirks, v9\".\nTyra had forgotten which heist was her favorite. Perhaps it was the time they stole a wagon's worth of silks from the desert palaces of Dune. Maybe it was when they burrowed a tunnel into the warehouse of the East Empire Company, siphoning crate after crate while the wardens stood mindlessly at the door. Or it could be she preferred the more violent raids, like the sacking of the Argonian supply caravans, or the attacks on cargo ships leaving the Imperial City &lt;a href=\"Imperial%20City%20Waterfront\"&gt;waterfront&lt;/a&gt;.\nOr perhaps if she looked back far enough, her fondest memories would find her in the streets of Balmora, robbing travelers at knifepoint. For some reason it was this version of her, this long forgotten stranger, that seemed the most vivid now. Gone was the refined, thoughtful countenance of a leader, and in its place a hungry, ash-hewn child who had far more courage than sense. And if she closed her eyes, she could still feel the smooth, polished surface of the ruby the noble dropped in her palm, and how it felt like nothing of this world.\nYet it was not the price or the feel, but the color of the ruby that she remembered most; the blades of crimson burned into the glass, like the fire of the &lt;a href=\"Red%20Mountain\"&gt;Red Mountain&lt;/a&gt;.\n\"Why do you think it is,\" she asked Aesrael, \"that our thoughts turn to the past when are lives are so close to death?\"\n\"I suppose because it's pointless for a dead man to look forward,\" replied the bandit, his Altmer frame filling the breadth of her doorway, \"but I take it you didn't summon me to talk about old times.\"\n\"Ehlhiel says the city guard knows about the hideout. They plan to raid the place in three days.\"\n\"So they will,\" Aesrael replied, his face unflinching, \"What of the spoils?\"\n\"We can't take it with us,\" Tyra lamented, \"but I'll be damned if I let them have it. We give what we can to the beggars, and toss the rest into the bay before we leave.\"\n\"As you wish,\" said the High Elf, \"and where will you go?\"\n\"Our best chance is north,\" Tyra said, tracing her dagger up the map, \"The Jarls are fractured. It's only a matter of time before the whole province is at war. But we'll have to move in small groups, and find our own way once we cross the border. No contact.\"\nTyra knew Aesrael would take to the news better than the rest. While Bjormund, Skjol, and Peladius were the muscle, they always made an effort to bond with the group. The High Elf, on the other hand, never felt at ease with the other bandits. If this were any other business, perhaps she would've tried to reach him, but tenderness was not a virtue for killers and thieves.\nAesrael nodded and took his leave, leaving Tyra alone in the quiet. If this exchange taught her anything, she still needed a moment before telling the others. She had always been an expert at masking her emotions, but the sadness wore plainly on her face. Perhaps this situation called for that girl from Balmora, and not the weary woman who sat in her stead.\nSteeling herself, Tyra placed the dirk and the ruby in her pouch and stepped away from the map. They would head for the border tomorrow, leaving behind much of their past, but the future still unwritten."}

Formed by the &lt;a href=\"Nord\"&gt;Nord&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Tyra%20Blood-Fire\"&gt;Tyra Blood-Fire&lt;/a&gt;, the Dirks raided various warehouses and caravans, and had became a target of the &lt;a href=\"East%20Empire%20Company\"&gt;East Empire Company&lt;/a&gt;. The Dirks disbanded after accidentally killing a &lt;a href=\"Penitus%20Oculatus\"&gt;Penitus Oculatus&lt;/a&gt; agent, resulting in reprisal from the &lt;a href=\"Third%20Empire\"&gt;Empire&lt;/a&gt;.\nHistory.\nFormation.\nThe Dirks' founder, Tyra Blood-Fire, formed the group from a desire to see its members reflect her own qualities. Growing up on the streets of &lt;a href=\"Balmora\"&gt;Balmora&lt;/a&gt; and seeing how the &lt;a href=\"Great%20Houses\"&gt;Great Houses&lt;/a&gt; operated, she wanted her group to be more than common bandits whom she saw as short-sighted and disloyal. Tyra sought the assistance of the &lt;a href=\"Dunmer\"&gt;Dunmer&lt;/a&gt; named &lt;a href=\"Reaver%20%28The%20Crimson%20Dirks%29\"&gt;Reaver&lt;/a&gt; whom she met while begging. Reaver, now a wealthy noble living in &lt;a href=\"Skingrad\"&gt;Skingrad&lt;/a&gt;, connected Tyra with her first members in exchange for gold: &lt;a href=\"Aesrael\"&gt;Aesrael&lt;/a&gt;, an &lt;a href=\"Altmer\"&gt;Altmer&lt;/a&gt; hunter; &lt;a href=\"Peladius\"&gt;Peladius&lt;/a&gt;, a disgraced &lt;a href=\"Imperial\"&gt;Imperial&lt;/a&gt; guardsman; and &lt;a href=\"Antonius\"&gt;Antonius&lt;/a&gt; a hedge mage and a drunkard. Among the four Dirks, Reaver himself was their first target. They killed his estate's guards, bespelled the servants and loaded all the gold they could find into wagons. Tyra, her work unfinished, assassinated Reaver in his bed chambers, leaving only the gold that was originally owed to him.\nIn the following year, Tyra had greatly expanded the Dirks with the addition of &lt;a href=\"Casival\"&gt;Casival&lt;/a&gt;, a Dunmer scribe; &lt;a href=\"Yakhtu%20gra-Orkulg\"&gt;Yakhtu gra-Orkulg&lt;/a&gt;, an &lt;a href=\"Orsimer\"&gt;Orsimer&lt;/a&gt; blacksmith; the twins &lt;a href=\"Erwan\"&gt;Erwan&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Edward%20%28The%20Crimson%20Dirks%29\"&gt;Edward&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Breton\"&gt;Breton&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"battlemage\"&gt;battlemage&lt;/a&gt;s; &lt;a href=\"M%27Sharra\"&gt;M'Sharra&lt;/a&gt;, a &lt;a href=\"Khajiit\"&gt;Khajiit&lt;/a&gt; thief; the brothers &lt;a href=\"Fathrys\"&gt;Fathrys&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Ehlheil\"&gt;Ehlheil&lt;/a&gt;, a &lt;a href=\"Bosmer\"&gt;Bosmer&lt;/a&gt; archer and mage, respectively; &lt;a href=\"Pale-Eyes%20%28Skyrim%20Creation%20Club%29\"&gt;Pale-Eyes&lt;/a&gt;, an &lt;a href=\"Argonian\"&gt;Argonian&lt;/a&gt; warrior; &lt;a href=\"Zaharia\"&gt;Zaharia&lt;/a&gt;, a &lt;a href=\"Redguard\"&gt;Redguard&lt;/a&gt; leader; &lt;a href=\"Urgnok\"&gt;Urgnok&lt;/a&gt;, an Orsimer warrior; and the Nords &lt;a href=\"Skjol\"&gt;Skjol&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Bjormund\"&gt;Bjormund&lt;/a&gt;, also warriors.\nActivities.\nAs the group raided warehouses and farms from &lt;a href=\"Bruma\"&gt;Bruma&lt;/a&gt; to &lt;a href=\"Dune\"&gt;Dune&lt;/a&gt;, Tyra aspired for the Dirks to grow in influence across all of &lt;a href=\"Tamriel\"&gt;Tamriel&lt;/a&gt;. One night, the Dirks attacked a caravan of monks and priests escorting supplies destined for a temple. Among the supplies was an &lt;a href=\"Amulet%20of%20Talos\"&gt;Amulet of Talos&lt;/a&gt;. Tyra, understanding that the Thalmor in the area were known to ransack caravans suspected of aiding Talos worship, instructed Yakhtu to create replicas. The Dirks would plant the fake amulets on caravans they raided, convincing the guards that the destroyed caravans were the work of the Thalmor.\nWhile in &lt;a href=\"Elsweyr\"&gt;Elsweyr&lt;/a&gt;, Edward and Peladius had killed a Khajiit merchant during a card game before the merchant was able to send a letter she had written earlier outing them as criminals to the &lt;a href=\"Aldmeri%20Dominion%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Dominion&lt;/a&gt;. Some time later, in an attempt to impress Zaharia, Fathrys died at &lt;a href=\"Yorgrim%20Overlook\"&gt;Yorgrim Overlook&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Skyrim\"&gt;Skyrim&lt;/a&gt; trying to recover the &lt;a href=\"Studded%20Dragonscale%20Armor\"&gt;armor&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"Ulfnir%20Bone-Skin\"&gt;Ulfnir Bone-Skin&lt;/a&gt;.\nAfter recovering a ring during a raid, Erwan became convinced that it was cursed when coin started to dry up, new guard patrols appeared in the Dirks' preferred areas and the &lt;a href=\"East%20Empire%20Company\"&gt;East Empire Company&lt;/a&gt; became aware of their activities. As a new group of smugglers appeared near them, the Dirks had intended to flex their muscle and return with more members or a cut of their profits. The smugglers, however, turned out to be &lt;a href=\"Daedric\"&gt;Daedric&lt;/a&gt; cultists and took Erwan and some others captive. Erwan was able to use the ring to cast a spell of &lt;a href=\"hysteria\"&gt;hysteria&lt;/a&gt;, forcing the cultists to kill each other, and allowing them to be eventually rescued by their comrades.\nWith the East Empire Company taking a keen interest in their activities, the Dirks were forced to take on more simple crimes and petty thievery. The now-destroyed Daedric cult, however, had left them with a supply of valuables as well as enchanted weapons and fine goods from warehouses in &lt;a href=\"Anvil\"&gt;Anvil&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Chorrol\"&gt;Chorrol&lt;/a&gt;. As their luck seemed to have been turning around, they made contact with a merchant noble to assist them with laundering their goods. During the meeting, the noble was killed by an assassin who also injured Casival. The assassin slit his own throat to avoid capture, but Aesrael was able to determine that he was a member of the Imperial intelligence service, the &lt;a href=\"Penitus%20Oculatus\"&gt;Penitus Oculatus&lt;/a&gt;, sent to assassinate the noble for conspiring with the Thalmor.\nDissolution.\nDue to their involvement in the death of a Penitus Oculatus agent and having been seen meeting with a noble whom the Empire knew to be in league with the Thalmor, the Dirks disbanded to avoid the Empire's attention. Sometime after the botched meeting, the guards became aware of the Dirks base of operations and planned to raid it. Knowing that they could not move their loot, the Dirks gave as much of their ill-begotten fortune as they could to beggars and threw the rest into the water. The Dirks then traveled north together in small groups until the border of Skyrim where they separated."}

Many know of the crown's famed beauty, but few know the true intent of the crown and why it was created\u2014and that it was even worn by other monarchs before &lt;a href=\"Queen%20Freydis\"&gt;Queen Freydis&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe Crown of Freydis is actually the second royal crown of &lt;a href=\"Skyrim%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Skyrim&lt;/a&gt;. The fabled &lt;a href=\"The%20Jagged%20Crown%20%28Item%29\"&gt;Jagged Crown&lt;/a&gt; holds the distinction of being the first. The Jagged Crown was forged by &lt;a href=\"Harald\"&gt;Harald&lt;/a&gt;, first king of the &lt;a href=\"Nords%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Nords&lt;/a&gt;, from the bones of &lt;a href=\"Dragons%20%28Lore%29\"&gt;dragons&lt;/a&gt;. Legend has it that the Jagged Crown disappeared with the death of Harald's final descendant King &lt;a href=\"Borgas\"&gt;Borgas&lt;/a&gt; in The &lt;a href=\"Wild%20Hunt\"&gt;Wild Hunt&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"1E%20369\"&gt;1E 369&lt;/a&gt;. The death of childless King Borgas, last of the line of &lt;a href=\"Ysgramor%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Ysgramor&lt;/a&gt;, triggered an internecine conflict known as the &lt;a href=\"War%20of%20Succession\"&gt;War of Succession&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe War of Succession raged for more than fifty years before &lt;a href=\"Olaf%20One-Eye\"&gt;Olaf One-Eye&lt;/a&gt; became the new &lt;a href=\"High%20King\"&gt;High King&lt;/a&gt; of Skyrim. Olaf was elected to the position primarily due to the renown he garnered subduing the dragon &lt;a href=\"Numinex\"&gt;Numinex&lt;/a&gt;, and not for any benevolence or statesmanship on his part. The rule of Olaf One-Eye was a time marked by great strife and division among the Nords. When he also died without a clear heir, it was decided that a new manner be employed for choosing a new High King.\nEach of Skyrim's holds sent a mage to a convocation called specifically to craft a magical artifact that would test the worth of potential candidates for High King. To this end, they created the &lt;a href=\"Crown%20of%20Verity\"&gt;Crown of Verity&lt;/a&gt;. Crafting the artifact in the shape of a crown was a brilliant innovation. With the loss of the Jagged Crown, Olaf had worn no mark of recognizable rulership. They felt that a new crown would help unify the realm behind a new king after the relative instability of Olaf's rule. The timing of the crown's creation proved to be auspicious.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Moot\"&gt;Moot&lt;/a&gt; selected a tribal chieftain named &lt;a href=\"Asurn%20Ice-Breaker\"&gt;Asurn Ice-Breaker&lt;/a&gt; to be the next High King of Skyrim. Asurn was a mighty warrior of unmatched skill in the vein of &lt;a href=\"Olaf%20One-Eye\"&gt;Olaf One-Eye&lt;/a&gt;, though he never defeated a dragon. Before he assumed the role, however, he had to don the newly-forged Crown of Verity. That's when the true power of the artifact became apparent.\nThe crown rejected Asurn. It literally refused to be placed upon his head. In a rage, Asurn summoned his loyal followers and threatened to kill every member of the Moot if they didn't name him as the rightful king. He refused to be rejected by a crown. A soft-spoken member of the council rose from his chair. He challenged Asurn to combat, according to the law. The battle was short and to the point: Asurn was struck down. When the soft-spoken man took the crown and placed it easily upon his own head, a new High King of Skyrim was born. That was how &lt;a href=\"Kjoric%20the%20White\"&gt;Kjoric the White&lt;/a&gt; rose to power.\nTo this day, the Crown of Freydis has been passed down from High King to High King. It is used as a tool by the Moot to ascertain the worthiness of any candidate for the throne. Since the day Asurn was struck down, no one has challenged the validity of the Crown or its powers\u2014until &lt;a href=\"2E%20431\"&gt;2E 431&lt;/a&gt;, when the &lt;a href=\"Reman%20Empire\"&gt;Reman Empire&lt;/a&gt; fell asunder, and King &lt;a href=\"Logrolf\"&gt;Logrolf&lt;/a&gt; was assassinated.\n&lt;a href=\"Jarl\"&gt;Jarl&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Svartr\"&gt;Svartr&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"Solitude\"&gt;Solitude&lt;/a&gt; claimed that Logrolf's daughter, Freydis, was illegitimate, and therefore a Moot was required to choose a successor. Though Freydis, wearing the Crown of Verity, was named High Queen in &lt;a href=\"Windhelm%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Windhelm&lt;/a&gt;, a partial Moot in Solitude chose Svartr as High King. Thereafter the &lt;a href=\"West%20Kingdom\"&gt;West Kingdom&lt;/a&gt; was ruled by Svartr and his successors, while the East Kingdom was ruled by the heirs to Freydis, who renamed the &lt;a href=\"Crown%20of%20Verity\"&gt;Crown of Verity&lt;/a&gt; in her honor."}

Who delivered countless multitudes from the darkness and sinful sloth of a &lt;a href=\"Second%20Empire\"&gt;society&lt;/a&gt; drowning in its own decadence? Who put to flight the corrupt elites fattening themselves on the wealth of a people so deluded and disillusioned they no longer knew what justice was? What can be said of Durcorach, the Black Drake, &lt;a href=\"Cyrodiil\"&gt;Cyrodiil&lt;/a&gt;'s savior? Where would we be without long-overdue reckoning and redress of wrongs he brought to us? Bow down, O Cyrodiil, and give thanks for your liberation. Surely the birth of &lt;a href=\"Longhouse%20Emperors\"&gt;a new era&lt;/a&gt; is at hand!\nDurcorach's story begins in the clean wilderness and snowy mountains of the north. A great comet blazed across the sky on the night of our future Emperor's birth, and seven sevens of silver swans flew over his mother's humble shelter in the hour he came into the world. All who beheld the infant were struck by the strong beauty of his young face, with eyes so dark and fierce that great warriors could not bear to meet his gaze.\nIt must be said that our future Emperor was raised in no palace befitting his magnificence, but rather in the humblest and hardest of environments. The great wilderness of &lt;a href=\"the%20Reach\"&gt;the Reach&lt;/a&gt; is home to many trials and dangers, but these challenges served only to strengthen the boy Emperor from his earliest days and teach him the value of courage, honor, endurance, and wisdom. At the age of three, young Durcorach saved his mother's life by seizing his father's hunting-spear and slaying with one fell stroke a great &lt;a href=\"Black%20Bear\"&gt;black bear&lt;/a&gt; that had already devoured twenty warriors. And when he was only five years of age, Durcorach saved his village from starving in a cold, hard winter by hunting a herd of a hundred &lt;a href=\"elk\"&gt;elk&lt;/a&gt; from &lt;a href=\"Karthwasten\"&gt;Karthwasten&lt;/a&gt; to the high peaks of the &lt;a href=\"Druadach%20Mountains\"&gt;Druadach Mountains&lt;/a&gt;.\nMighty in the hunt from the time he could walk, Durcorach soon learned wisdom as well. The &lt;a href=\"eagle\"&gt;eagle&lt;/a&gt; taught him how to hear the tidings of far lands carried on the winds and how to see into a man's heart with a single glance. The swift icy stream leaping down from the peaks taught him to make music so lovely that no one who heard the boy Emperor sing could ever again find joy in any lesser song. And the great gray &lt;a href=\"wolves\"&gt;wolves&lt;/a&gt; taught him the meaning of courage, loyalty, and leadership.\nIn his hard homeland, young Durcorach soon found it necessary to master the ways of war. On his seventh birthday, a tribe of &lt;a href=\"Giants\"&gt;Giants&lt;/a&gt; as tall as hundred-year-old trees invaded the peaceful pastures in which his people kept their flocks\n\"[The rest of the manuscript is charred and unreadable.]\""}

The Crowns are seen as traditionalists who worship the old gods of Yokuda. The Crowns also reject the practices of the rest of Tamriel. Weddings between the Crowns and the Forebears are tense and rare due to cultural issues, in part due to either family being ignorant of which allegiance the couple will have. Other fears on the part of the Crowns is that they believe such a wedding would result in religious conversion, and cultural adaptation.\nThey appear in , where they have temporarily put aside their hostility towards the Forebears due to the threat from &lt;a href=\"Molag%20Bal\"&gt;Molag Bal&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe Crowns worship traditional Yokudan gods, such as &lt;a href=\"Ruptga\"&gt;Ruptga&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Tu%27whacca\"&gt;Tu'whacca&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Zeht\"&gt;Zeht&lt;/a&gt;.\nReligion.\nThe Crowns, unlike &lt;a href=\"The%20Forebears\"&gt;The Forebears&lt;/a&gt;, stick true to the old Yokudan Gods, who try to maintain the traditions of Yokuda in their new homeland. The priests of Redguard Divines such as Tu\u2019whacca, Zeht, and Ruptga have an active presence in Hammerfell. As such, their religion is as listed below.\nHistory.\n&lt;a href=\"First%20Era\"&gt;First Era&lt;/a&gt;.\nAfter the &lt;a href=\"Ra%20Gada\"&gt;Ra Gada&lt;/a&gt; had cleared the way for the King of &lt;a href=\"Yokuda\"&gt;Yokuda&lt;/a&gt;, the Crowns first settled the city of &lt;a href=\"Sentinel\"&gt;Sentinel&lt;/a&gt;. Crown descendants of the &lt;a href=\"Ra%20Gada\"&gt;Ra Gada&lt;/a&gt; who came from &lt;a href=\"Yath\"&gt;Yath&lt;/a&gt; had also settled in the Elven city of &lt;a href=\"Salas%20En\"&gt;Salas En&lt;/a&gt;, until the &lt;a href=\"Thrassian%20Plague\"&gt;Thrassian Plague&lt;/a&gt; broke out. Under the &lt;a href=\"Reman%20Empire\"&gt;Reman Empire&lt;/a&gt;, the Crowns and Forebears were truly formed, this republic only lasted until the end of the Second Empire, as afterwards, control was returned to the Na-Totambu, and their High King. Under the rules of the High King, the capital was moved from &lt;a href=\"Hegathe\"&gt;Hegathe&lt;/a&gt; to &lt;a href=\"Sentinel\"&gt;Sentinel&lt;/a&gt;.\n&lt;a href=\"Second%20Era\"&gt;Second Era&lt;/a&gt;.\nDuring the &lt;a href=\"Tiber%20Wars\"&gt;Tiber Wars&lt;/a&gt; the Crowns and Forebears were originally united under High King &lt;a href=\"Thassad%20II\"&gt;Thassad II&lt;/a&gt;, but this changed when the King died. The death of the King resulted in a &lt;a href=\"Hammerfell%20Civil%20War\"&gt;Civil War&lt;/a&gt; between the Crowns and the Forebears, with the Forebears being led by &lt;a href=\"Baron%20Volag\"&gt;Baron Volag&lt;/a&gt;, and the Crowns being led by the heir of Thassad, Prince &lt;a href=\"A%27Tor\"&gt;A'Tor&lt;/a&gt;. Though originally being beaten back by the Forebears, the Crowns crushed the Forebears when they reformed and fought back, pushing the Forebears back across the &lt;a href=\"Alik%27r\"&gt;Alik'r&lt;/a&gt; desert. The Forebears, now fearfull of defeat, decided to sign a pact with Emperor &lt;a href=\"Tiber%20Septim\"&gt;Tiber Septim&lt;/a&gt;. In return for the aid of the &lt;a href=\"Imperial%20Legion\"&gt;Imperial Legion&lt;/a&gt;s, the Empire would be given some border territory of Hammerfell. Tiber Septim agreed, and sent his Legions to Hammerfell. Many Crowns deserted as a result of the stength of the Legions, as the Crowns were getting crushed and pushed back. Prince A'Tor himself died during the &lt;a href=\"Battle%20of%20Hunding%20Bay\"&gt;Battle of Hunding Bay&lt;/a&gt;, and after this, the Crowns were beaten. At the end of the War, Baron Volag disappeared, which resulted in the Empire claiming all of Hammerfell and sending its Legions to watch over it. This was eventually turned around when a Crown loyalist group, the &lt;a href=\"Restless%20League\"&gt;Restless League&lt;/a&gt;, killed &lt;a href=\"Amiel%20Richton\"&gt;Amiel Richton&lt;/a&gt; and took over &lt;a href=\"Stros%20M%27kai\"&gt;Stros M'kai&lt;/a&gt;, after which Baron Volag reclaimed &lt;a href=\"Sentinel\"&gt;Sentinel&lt;/a&gt;. As a result, the Emperor would sail to Stros M'Kai to negotiate the terms of the &lt;a href=\"Treaty%20of%20Stros%20M%27kai\"&gt;Treaty of Stros M'kai&lt;/a&gt; with Crown representative &lt;a href=\"Iszara\"&gt;Iszara&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Baron%20Volag\"&gt;Baron Volag&lt;/a&gt; of the Forebears, resulting in Hammerfell being less of a subject to the Empire.\n&lt;a href=\"Third%20Era\"&gt;Third Era&lt;/a&gt;.\nDuring the &lt;a href=\"War%20of%20Bend%27r-Mahk\"&gt;War of Bend'r-Mahk&lt;/a&gt;, the Crowns were attacked by the &lt;a href=\"Nords\"&gt;Nords&lt;/a&gt; of Skyrim, who conqeured &lt;a href=\"Elinhir\"&gt;Elinhir&lt;/a&gt; and half of &lt;a href=\"Dragonstar\"&gt;Dragonstar&lt;/a&gt; from the Crowns who defended it. This is partially attributed to the Crowns not aiding the Forebears cities of &lt;a href=\"Rihad\"&gt;Rihad&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Taneth\"&gt;Taneth&lt;/a&gt; during the invasion by the &lt;a href=\"Camoran%20Usurper\"&gt;Camoran Usurper&lt;/a&gt;. In &lt;a href=\"3E%20432\"&gt;3E 432&lt;/a&gt; the worship of &lt;a href=\"Satakal\"&gt;Satakal&lt;/a&gt; was backed by king &lt;a href=\"Lhotun\"&gt;Lhotun&lt;/a&gt;, but was not supported by either Crown or Forebear. As a result, a military campaign was fought by some Crowns, which proved succesful, as they reclaimed &lt;a href=\"Totambu\"&gt;Totambu&lt;/a&gt; from the kingdom of &lt;a href=\"Sentinel\"&gt;Sentinel&lt;/a&gt;. It is unknown if the Crowns were able to hold onto this land, as it was surrounded on all sides by the territory of Sentinel. The Crowns in easter Hammerfell were less concerned with Sentinel, and tried to reclaim Elinhir and Dragonstar from the Nords, though little progress was made.\n&lt;a href=\"Fourth%20Era\"&gt;Fourth Era&lt;/a&gt;.\nIn the year &lt;a href=\"4E%20168\"&gt;4E 168&lt;/a&gt;, the Crowns and Forebears were in civil war as Emperor &lt;a href=\"Titus%20Mede%20II\"&gt;Titus Mede II&lt;/a&gt; was crowned. When in &lt;a href=\"4E%20171\"&gt;4E 171&lt;/a&gt; the Great War broke out, most of Hammerfell's coastline was quickly overrun by the Aldmeri forces. Of the cities along the coast, only &lt;a href=\"Hegathe\"&gt;Hegathe&lt;/a&gt;, a Crown City, still held out. When a Forebear army from Sentinel broke the Aldmeri siege on Hegathe in 173, the Crowns and Forebears stood united, and continued to fight the Aldmeri until the signing of the &lt;a href=\"Second%20Treaty%20of%20Stros%20M%27kai\"&gt;Second Treaty of Stros M'kai&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"4E%20180\"&gt;4E 180&lt;/a&gt;.\nHoldings.\nThe terrain traditionally held by the Crowns are in the northern parts of the province, which continued to be more traditionally Yokudan. The following are the cities which are associated with the Crowns."}
