She was known to spin words the way a spider spins its web, alluring and beautiful. But this clever tongue came with a boastful mouth.\n\"Living or dead, there are none in &lt;a href=\"Akavir\"&gt;Akavir&lt;/a&gt; who can match my wit!\" Kail-Perwa proclaimed one day.\nThough her parents tried to silence her, Kail-Perwa would not take back her words. She repeated them one, twice, thrice. And on that third time, her words were so sure and loud that they echoed all the way into the afterlife.\n\"There are none so clever as I!\"\nThough all of Kail-Perwa's ancestors were displeased with her words, one spirit particular took great offense. It was the spirit of General Haro-Banar, a man who had won many great victories with his cleverness. The general had always been modest about his accomplishments, and was displeased that his descendant did not follow his example.\n\"Kail-Perwa claims to be more clever than all, living and dead,\" the general proclaimed. \"I shall travel to the world of the living and see if these boastful words hold any truth.\"\nGeneral Haro-Banar was well-honored by the living, and so his spirit was strong enough to leave the afterlife and venture into the mortal realm. He did so now, changing his ghostly appearance into that of a warrior dressed in golden armor. Swift as the wind, he traveled to Kail-Perwa's village and sought her out.\nThe general found Kail-Perwa in the edge of the village, collecting herbs for her house. Fot a moment he hesitated, for the general knew his descendant to be as dutiful as she was clever. And so he resolved to give her one last chance to renounce her boastful ways and live modestly.\n\"I seek Kail-Perwa,\" said General Haro-Banar, making his presence known. \"Be you her?\nKail-Perwa looked up and nodded, wiping the dirt from the palm of her hands. \"Yes, I am she.\"\n\"It is said that you claim to be more clever than any living or any dead. Be this true?\"\nKail-Perwa stood to her full height and gave the general a confident smile. \"Yes, it is true. There is none so clever as I.\"\n\"That is quite the claim to make,\" replied the general, his voice growing cold. \"After all, how can you prove yourself against the dead?\"\nKail-Perwa shrugged. \"Should any of the dead take offense from my words, let them prove themselves to me! After all, cannot spirits visit the land of the living?\"\n\"Very well,\" said the general with a solemn nod. \"For the next three nights, you will be visited by the cleverest of your ancestors. Prove yourself to them, and your boast will become truth.\"\nSuddenly, Kail-Perwa was afraid. How could this stranger make such a claim?\n\"Who are you?\" she asked, her voice trembling.\n\"I am he who will meet you on the third night,\" said General Haro-Banar, his voice mighty, his gaze unflinching. \"I am he who will acknowledge you as the cleverest of all, should you prove yourself so. And I am he who will punish you, should your boasts be but clever lies.\"\nAnd with that, he was gone."}

The warrior in gold had claimed that she would be visited by three of her cleverest ancestors. Should Kail-Perwa fail to prove her wit to all three of them, she would be punished. But how would she be punished?\nKail-Perwa was clever enough to know that the warrior in gold who visited her was an ancestral spirit. As such, the spirit had the power to grant her both great fortune or misfortune, depending on his ruling. He could even drag Kail-Perwa to the afterlife, should he be truly angered.\nWould she be able to pass these three trials? Would she be killed if she failed? Such questions kept Kail-Perwa awake late into the night, until at last she fell asleep.\nWhen Kail-Perwa next awakened, she was not truly awake. She was inside a dream, of this she was sure, but her consciousness had never been so clear and aware in a dream as it was now. Truly, it felt like she had been transported into another realm.\nAnd what a strange realm it was. The land around her was covered in a thin layer of water, cold against her feet. The sky above was an endless white. The only distinguishing feature was a twisted, black tree, jutting out from the water. And next to this tree was a lone woman, dressed in red.\nKail-Perwa instantly knew this was the first spirit to would judge her.\nThe woman in red smiled. She was young and beautiful with a noble bearing, and when she spoke, her voice was like the wind which foretells a great storm.\n\"I have come to judge you,\" said the woman in red, \"for you have claimed to be more clever than I. As your ancestor, I bear right to test that cleverness. Do you accept my judgement?\"\nKail-Perwa bowed deeply and said, \"I do.\"\n\"My task is simple, then. You must walk to me. This is all.\"\nKail-Perwa worried her lip, for she doubted the task was as simple as the woman in red declared. Still, the only action she could take was to move forward. But as Kail-Perwa walked, she quickly found herself moving further and further away. It was if the tree and the woman in red leaned away from her, just as swiftly as she walked forward.\n\"All is not as it seems,\" thought Kail-Perwa. \"There is a trick to this place that I have yet to see.\"\nSo she looked behind her, and saw but endless water. She looked above, and saw but endless sky. But then she looked below, and saw her own reflection. And this reflection, as impossible as it may have been, was facing away from the woman in red.\nKail-Perwa could almost laugh! What a simple trick. As she moved forward, her reflection was moving her away from the woman in red. In order to walk towards the spirit, she must move her reflection in the correct direction, not herself.\nAnd so Kail-Perwa turned away from the woman in red and began to walk. It was an odd sensation, as her steps seemed to pull the land ahead of her further away. Very quickly, she heard a tinkling laugh near her ear. She turned around, now face to face with the mysterious spirit.\nThe woman in red smiled and said, \"Very good, Kail-Perwa. You have solved my task. But tell me, do you realize the lesson learned?\"\nKail-Perwa bit her lip and shook her head, for she did not know.\n\"To go forward, sometimes you must go back,\" the woman in red gently explained. \"Let this lesson be your guiding words, for there are still two trials ahead.\"\nAnd with that, Kail-Perwa awoke to the morning sun."}

Why had she worried? After all, there was none so clever as she! Why concern herself about a punishment that would never come to pass?\nThere were just two more trials left. If Kail-Perwa succeeded in both, and she was confident that she would, her boast would become a proven truth! Perhaps her ancestors would even reward her for such a victory.\nKail-Perwa found it easy to fall asleep that night.\nJust as before, she entered into a dream. Again, the land around her was covered in a thin layer of water, cold against her feet. Again, the sky above was an endless white. But this time there was no black tree or woman in read. Instead, there was black table with two black chairs. Seated at one of the chairs was an elderly man dressed in blue.\nKail-Perwa bowed to the ancestral spirit and politely said, \"Greetings, grandfather.\"\n\"Ah, Kail-Perwa. You have come at last to meet this old man,\" the grandfather in blue greeted. \"Please, have a seat so we may begin your trial.\"\nWith only a moment's hesitation, Kail-Perwa did as she was bid. She found no trickery in her steps this time, and easily found her way to the table where she took a seat.\n\"Now, as for your trial,\" the grandfather continued, \"It is very simple. We will play a single game of tihasae. Your only goal is to stop my victory. Do you understand?\"\nKail-Perwa nodded, though her stomach clenched. She had played tihasae many times, this was true. It was a game which required great cunning to win, and Kail-Perwa won it often. But could she prevail against this elderly spirit, who had both wisdom and cunning on his side?\nWith a swipe of his hand, the grandfather in blue summoned a tihasae board. The game pieces were bone white, contrasting against the dark browns of the board. He gestured towards Kail-Perwa, inviting her to take the first move. And so the game began.\nIt was not an easy battle. Kail-Perwa's hands shook as she moved her pieces across the board. Every time she went in for an attack, the grandpa in blue was there with a impassable defense. And when he struck her pieces, he struck mercilessly. Quickly, quicker than Kail-Perwa thought possible, she was on the verge of defeat.\nAt last, Kail-Perwa found herself one turn from losing. There was no way she could win, no way she could even escape defeat. This, she was clever enough to see.\nBut must she win? Suddenly, Kail-Perwa's eyes opened wide. The grandfather in blue said to stop his victory. If this was truly a simple task, did she truly need to win against him?\nWithout another thought, Kail-Perwa swiped her hand across the board. The tihasae pieces scattered into the water with soft plops, sinking further and further than should have been possible. With that simple action, there was no way for the game to conclude. There was no way for either competitor to win.\nThe grandfather in blue chuckled and said, \"Very good, Kail-Perwa. With one move, you have stopped my victory. Simple, was it not?\"\nKail-Perwa panted, her breaths ragged and short. She had nearly failed the trial, and it was very possible that such a failure could have resulted in her death.\n\"And now a lesson for you,\" the grandfather in blue continued, nodding his head. \"Seek what is true, not what is obvious. Let this lesson be your guiding words, for there is still one trial ahead.\"\nAnd with that, Kail-Perwa awoke to the morning sun."}

She had come so close to losing her second trial, and now she was to face a third. Failure to pass this last trial would result in a grave punishment. Perhaps ever her death.\nShe thought of all of her options. Was there was a priest could protect her from the spirits? A potion that would let her stay awake forever? But the more she thought, the less realistic each idea became.\nSo afraid was Kail-Perwa, she did not fall asleep until well until the night.\nShe awoke into a dream once more. Again, she was greeted by a land of endless water and sky of endless water and a sky of endless white. But this time, the warrior in gold stood before her in all his glory. In his hands was a mighty black sword, so large that Kail-Perwa could never hope to lift it.\n\"You have passed two trials,\" said the warrior in gold, his voice as proud and strong as his bearing. \"But you have yet to pass mine. Do you accept my judgment, descendant?\"\nKail-Perwa nodded quickly, just once. She knew it would be useless to object.\n\"You have proven to be clever twice through your actions,\" continued the warrior in gold as he slung his mighty sword across his shoulders. \"But how clever are your words? This will be your last trial, Kail-Perwa. Convince me that you are more clever than all living and all dead.\"\nFor the first time in her life, Kail-Perwa did not know what to say. What words could she weave to convince this spirit of such cleverness?\n\"To go forward, sometimes you must look back,\" the woman in red had told her.\n\"Seek what is true, not what is obvious,\" the grandfather in blue had said.\nKail-Perwa closed her eyes and thought. She had overcome two trials to prove herself more clever than any other. But was that truly the purpose of her hardships? Using all of her cleverness, using all of her wit, she thought about what she had learned and what she must do.\nWhen next her eyes opened, Kail-Perwa knew she had found the truth.\n\"I can't,\" she told the warrior in gold, her hands trembling slightly. \"I can't convince you that I'm more clever than all living and all dead.\"\n\"Oh?\" asked the warrior in gold, his voice even. \"And why is that?\"\n\"Because I'm not,\" answered Kail-Perwa. \"If I was truly so clever, I would never make such a boast. There are many I have never met, and many I will never meet. And to condemn them to be less clever than I is foolishness.\"\n\"I see,\" said the warrior in gold, his face revealing nothing. \"And is this all you have to say?\"\nKail-Perwa bowed deeply, her head hung in shame. \"I know now that such boasts are an insult our family's good name. I apologize.\"\nAnd with this, the warrior's face broke into a grin. His armor transformed into noble robes, his face growing a long, full beard. And that was when Kail-Perwa realized that the spirit before her was none other than General Haron-Banar, the most honored of her ancestors.\n\"You have humbled yourself before me, despite risk of punishment,\" said General Haro-Banar. \"And for that, I will forgive your transgressions. Live modestly, my descendant, for there are none so clever as those who realize their own limitations.\"\n\"Thank you, General Haro-Banar,\" said Kail-Perwa, her heart filled with gratitude. \"That is a lesson I shall never forget.\"\nAnd so Kail-Perwa finally awoke to the wisdom of her ancestors, and all was well."}

He would continue to rule as the Ashkhan of Ald'ruhn up until &lt;a href=\"2E%20583\"&gt;2E 583&lt;/a&gt;. Chodala came into the possession of &lt;a href=\"Sunna%27rah\"&gt;Sunna'rah&lt;/a&gt;, a great staff created by &lt;a href=\"Sotha%20Sil\"&gt;Sotha Sil&lt;/a&gt;. The staff was repurposed by Chodala to steal the life energy from Vivec, which caused &lt;a href=\"Baar%20Dau\"&gt;Baar Dau&lt;/a&gt; to slowly fall from the sky. He would soon believe himself to be the Nerevarine that was foretold in the &lt;a href=\"Nerevarine%20Prophecy\"&gt;Nerevarine Prophecy&lt;/a&gt;. Chodala was confronted by both &lt;a href=\"Seryn%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Seryn&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Wise%20Woman%20Dovrosi\"&gt;Wise Woman Dovrosi&lt;/a&gt; and an Outlander called the &lt;a href=\"Vestige\"&gt;Vestige&lt;/a&gt; about his claim as the Nerevarine. Even though the past &lt;a href=\"Failed%20Incarnate\"&gt;Failed Incarnate&lt;/a&gt;s told him their mistakes and that their actions lead to their downfall. Unconvinced, Chodala escaped Ald'ruhn and left his warriors, the &lt;a href=\"Red%20Exiles\"&gt;Red Exiles&lt;/a&gt; to fend off the Ashlanders. Chodala fled to the ruins of &lt;a href=\"Kaushtarari\"&gt;Kaushtarari&lt;/a&gt; on &lt;a href=\"Azura%27s%20Coast\"&gt;Azura's Coast&lt;/a&gt; to call upon &lt;a href=\"Malacath\"&gt;Malacath&lt;/a&gt; to help him in his endeavors. Malacath refused to help since he was influenced another &lt;a href=\"Clavicus%20Vile\"&gt;Daedric Prince&lt;/a&gt;.

The Nerevarine roamed across the region to unite the people of Morrowind to fight against the Tribunal. The Nerevarine traveled to the &lt;a href=\"Urshilaku%20Camp\"&gt;Urshilaku Camp&lt;/a&gt; in the northern &lt;a href=\"Ashlands\"&gt;Ashlands&lt;/a&gt; and commenced the Third Trial of the Prophecy. &lt;a href=\"Ashkhan%20Sul-Matuul\"&gt;Ashkhan Sul-Matuul&lt;/a&gt; sent them to the ruins of &lt;a href=\"Kogoruhn\"&gt;Kogoruhn&lt;/a&gt; and eventually the &lt;a href=\"Cavern%20of%20the%20Incarnate\"&gt;Cavern of the Incarnate&lt;/a&gt; at the end of the &lt;a href=\"Valley%20of%20the%20Wind\"&gt;Valley of the Wind&lt;/a&gt;.

The war was won by the Septim Empire.\nThe Conquest.\nIn &lt;a href=\"2E%20862\"&gt;2E 862&lt;/a&gt;, Tiber Septim invaded &lt;a href=\"Hammerfell\"&gt;Hammerfell&lt;/a&gt; with the &lt;a href=\"Imperial%20Legion\"&gt;Imperial Legion&lt;/a&gt; after making a pact with the &lt;a href=\"Forebears\"&gt;Forebears&lt;/a&gt;. The pact made the Forebears recognize Tiber Septim as the ruler of Hammerfell. The army of Tiber Septim proved too much for the &lt;a href=\"Redguard\"&gt;Redguard&lt;/a&gt; Crowns. Tiber Septim then sent his best commander, &lt;a href=\"Amiel%20Richton\"&gt;Amiel Richton&lt;/a&gt;, to the port city of &lt;a href=\"Stros%20M%27kai\"&gt;Stros M'Kai&lt;/a&gt;. Here the &lt;a href=\"Battle%20of%20Hunding%20Bay\"&gt;Battle of Hunding Bay&lt;/a&gt; would play out with the Empire being victorious.\nBattle of Hunding Bay.\nThe Battle of Hunding Bay was a naval clash between the &lt;a href=\"Crown%20Navy\"&gt;Crown Navy&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"New%20West%20Navy\"&gt;New West Navy&lt;/a&gt;. The Crowns, knowing that Hammerfell's sovereignty is at stake, the proud Redguard forces match the might of the Empire. Admiral Richton, having seen the victories of &lt;a href=\"A%27Tor\"&gt;Prince A'Tor&lt;/a&gt; at sea before, decides to bring his last resort to the port. &lt;a href=\"Nafalilargus\"&gt;Nafalilargus&lt;/a&gt;, the proud jewel of the Imperial Crown. A'Tor commanded his archers to ready their weapons, but was struck down himself by the &lt;a href=\"Dunmer\"&gt;Dunmer&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"assassin\"&gt;assassin&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Dram\"&gt;Dram&lt;/a&gt;. The wizard of A'Tor tried to save the prince, but the Dragon ends his magic and the Crowns hope for victory in a single fiery breath.\nAftermath of the Battle of Hunding Bay.\nHammerfell falls to the Empire, with Amiel Richton being assigned as the provincial governor.\nSecond Battle of Hunding Bay.\nSome remaining Crowns still resist the Empire, these Crowns become known as the &lt;a href=\"Restless%20League\"&gt;Restless League&lt;/a&gt;. The Restless League raided Imperial vessels that were going to- and leaving from Stros M'Kai. One of these vessels was transporting &lt;a href=\"Cyrus%20%28Redguard%29\"&gt;Cyrus&lt;/a&gt;, the character you play as in . After a long time of planning and raiding, Cyrus causes the Restless League to attack Stros M'Kai, the Imperial Soldiers who were on guard duty were caught by surprise. The Legion was preparing for a counter-attack with a &lt;a href=\"Airships\"&gt;Dwemer airship&lt;/a&gt;. Cyrus however got on this airship, where he fought against Amiel Richton. Despite defeating Richton in a duel, Cyrus got disarmed, Dram and three Imperial Soldier surrounded Cyrus, demanding him to drop the &lt;a href=\"Soul%20Sword\"&gt;Soul Sword&lt;/a&gt;. After an exchange of words, the Soul Sword flew up into the sky and killed Richton as well as Dram, in the confusion, Cyrus drew his dagger and started sliding down the airship, cutting it open. The airship crashed, with the Imperial Soldiers inside of it falling to their deaths. The Battle was over, with the Crowns being victorious.\nAftermath.\nAs a result of the Battle of Stros M'Kai, &lt;a href=\"Sentinel\"&gt;Sentinel&lt;/a&gt; also rebelled against the Empire. Which resulted in Tiber Septim himself coming to Stros M'Kai to work out a &lt;a href=\"Treaty%20of%20Stros%20M%27kai\"&gt;treaty&lt;/a&gt; with Iszara and the rebel leader of Sentinel. In the end, Sentinel and Stros M'Kai rejoined the Empire after these treaties."}

Examples:\n codice_6\n codice_7\nThis will show a variety of ID's, under the category \"other forms.\" There are several identifications of the type of object or NPC the ID refers to. For example, there is a Thalmor dossier of Ulfric Stormcloak. The line representing its ID starts with \"BOOK:\" which means this ID is not representing Ulfric Stormcloak himself. Lines starting with \"NPC_:\" represent an NPC ID. However, there can be multiple lines starting with \"NPC_:\". These are all Base ID's, however they differ and contain variants of an NPC.\nReference ID.\nReference ID is the ID given to NPCs that appear in the game, it is used to disambiguate between multiple copy's of the same base NPC. It allows for multiple copies of the same NPC to be placed throughout the world without having to create individual copy's (Bandit001; Bandit002, etc.)\nFinding reference IDs in-game.\nWith the console open, click on an NPC, and their reference ID will appear.\nAs shown by the chart above, &lt;a href=\"Daedric%20Princes\"&gt;Daedric Princes&lt;/a&gt;, even those that cannot normally be seen, can be place in &lt;a href=\"Tamriel\"&gt;Tamriel&lt;/a&gt; using the \"placeatme\" command. Some are hostile (namely, Malacath) however, most are nonhostile. While these beings will walk around, use various animations (such as eating bread), and some will participate in fights, they cannot be interacted with to begin, continue, or finish any daedric or non-daedric quest. As of now, &lt;a href=\"Jyggalag\"&gt;Jyggalag&lt;/a&gt;, who was not included in the above chart because he makes no appearance in or its plugins, is the only daedric prince confirmed to have no IDs associated with him. Most of the Daedric princes do not appear as the race \"Dremora,\" and instead appear as various races found in Skyrim, such as Nord or Imperial; Molag Bal is the only one confirmed to appear as a dremora (test conducted with a sample size of 100). The daedric princes, when spawned in, except for a few (Malacath, In Daedric armor; Nocturnal, in Nocturnal's robes; Sheogorath, in Sheogorath's outfit; etc.) will be naked."}

The enchantments will be applied based on the value of the player's enchanting skill. A skill of 85 would apply a sneaking skill of 85%, and so on. This also means that any fortify enchanting effects of potions or apparel will affect the strength of the enchantments.\nSome Enchantments can only be used by themselves such as the Ebony Blade Absorb Health. In order to see what Enchantment must be by itself look for the Only Enchantment Section. If the Enchantment has to be used by itself you will see a Y if not you will see a N.\nTips.\nIf you want a permanent and immortal with 0 magica cost atronach, use the \"summon &lt;element&gt; atronach\" spell on a piece of armour. This will summon an atronach of your election permanently, being instantly re-summoned whenever it dies.\nNote: This trick may work on familiars and other summoned beings, but it has not been proven. Also, the spell on weapons does not work because the spell its \"summon &lt;element&gt; atronach for +0 seconds\" so every time you hit it instantly disappears.\nIf you want to create some really crazy stuff, this command to give yourself a full set of apparel (head, arms, legs, body) all with the fortify enchanting enchantment (id code: 00109632) applied twice. Then equip all of these items and repeat the process of giving yourself the enchanted apparel. The second set of apparel will be exponentially stronger than the first and this process can be repeated until the game crashes (do not know exactly why this happens, it seems to happen when either the value of the item exceeds 1 trillion or when the enchantment is stronger than 1 billion) this game crashing level of awesome only took about 5 repeats of the process (which is very quick because pushing the up arrow key when in command prompt accesses the last command you typed). Seeing as only two or three repeats of this process can make you armor and weapons that have similar effect to toggling god mode on (that command is TGM) it is suggested that you stop there, because after that the game will crash often and it become difficult to predict when it crash after this point. Save after every step.\nNote: You will not be able to learn enchantments from the items you receive using the codice_1 command.\nSome sort of working and interesting enchantments to use on items are:"}

The numerical value indicates the \"&lt;#&gt;\" used to go from level 20 to 21 in each skill.\nIncrements of 5000=1 skill boost 10000=2 and so on. codice_27\nNote that these values may increase as your skill advances, sneak, lockpicking, and light armor seem to double around the 25\u201330 range. If it looks as if nothing happens. Enter the command multiple times until you up a skill up, and use the number of times that command was entered as a multiplier. If you have to enter codice_28 three times to up a skill, the new value will show codice_29. This is useful if you want to increase skills by more than one level at a time. An easier way to level up quickly, for instance, to skill level 100, is to type in the command and skill and set the value to 100000000.\nExample: Archer started at skill-level 25 target skill 50, difference 25 skill-levels. multiply 25 by 43 (number given below) = 1075, then use codice_30 to advance the archery skill-level. Thus resulted in a new skill-level of 32. Then, take the actual number of skill-levels advanced (in this case 7) and divide them by 1075. This will result in 159. Multiply this by the difference between the desired skill-level and the new skill-level, (i.e., 50-32 = 18). In this case, the figure was 2862. Now use codice_31 to raise the skill-level. This resulted in a skill-level of 43. Again divide the figure used with codice_31, 2862, by the actual number of skill-levels raised, 8 = 357. Then, multiply by the number of level remaining value which is 50 - 43 = 7. This results in 2499. Enter this using codice_31 to reach skill-level 50. In general, multiply the figure below by the desired number of levels required. If this does not obtain the desired skill-level, simply divide the number which you input by the difference in level between the new one and the old one, then multiply by the number of skill levels between the new skill-level and the desired skill-level, and then input this using codice_31. Repeat this sequence until you reach your desired level.\nThe values shown above are the ones required to raise the level of the desired skill by one.\nSmithing and Enchanting are not listed above because the codice_1 adds too much experience to these skills to judge them properly in a single level. The closest achieved to whole levels without going much over was:\nSetAv Testing.\nTesting of codice_3 to go beyond 100:\nUnlike other skills, which behave without any glitch or problem and keep increasing their effects beyond the level \n100, Enchanting shows some problems and glitches.\nIf, for example, the Enchanting skill is set to level 200, all enchantings will become progressively stronger. However, a glitch occurs, which causes the cost of any enchanted item, with the exception of weapons, to not increase during the enchanting, regardless of the type of enchantment or used Soul Gem.\nThis issue is fixed by setting the value back to 100 or lower."}

I fear that, in the end, the proud and powerful Adusa-daro must die.\nShould I record the events that led to my epiphany? No, time is short and I have too much to do right now. Later, surely, there will be time enough to fill these pages with the wisdom I have acquired. Suffice it to say that Lleraya is not a monster. I am quite fascinated by the woman and eagerly wait to spend more time in her enchanting company. For now, let me just write that her words and deeds moved me. That her vision has become my vision.

She wears a &lt;a href=\"belted%20tunic\"&gt;belted tunic&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"boots\"&gt;boots&lt;/a&gt;.\nPersonality.\nIn stark contrast to Grelod, who is cruel and uncaring, Constance is a kind person. The children say that she is \"nice\" to them, and they want her to be in charge; &lt;a href=\"Aventus%20Aretino\"&gt;Aventus Aretino&lt;/a&gt; specifically requests that Constance be &lt;a href=\"Innocence%20Lost\"&gt;spared&lt;/a&gt;, showing how beloved she is. Even though she is appalled at her treatment of the children, Constance defends Grelod, saying that she was old and knows no other life. Constance is the only person in the orphanage to express any sorrow at Grelod's demise.\nInteractions.\nIf the &lt;a href=\"Last%20Dragonborn\"&gt;Dragonborn&lt;/a&gt; travels to Honorhall Orphanage in Riften (possibly at the behest of Aventus Aretino), Grelod will be seen berating and threatening the children. It is not possible to talk to Grelod, but Constance can be asked if Grelod is always that cruel to the children. Constance will admit that she is, and then try to usher the Dragonborn out, explaining that the children are not up for &lt;a href=\"adoption\"&gt;adoption&lt;/a&gt;, and it is cruel to get their hopes up.\nIf Grelod is killed, Constance enters a state of panic, but does not defend Grelod or alert the &lt;a href=\"Riften%20Guard\"&gt;Riften Guard&lt;/a&gt;. She sometimes may not panic, but will instead casually walk out of the orphanage, yelling at the Dragonborn to get out, even when spoken to outside. With Grelod gone, Constance takes over as orphanage headmistress, and conditions improve greatly for the children there, although she continues Grelod's policy of not allowing the children to be adopted.\nWith the \"Hearthfire\" DLC installed, Grelod will still not allow the children to be adopted, but Constance will be delighted to do so. Shortly after Grelod has been killed, a courier will deliver a notice and announce that the orphanage is under new management, and that the \"new lady in charge of the orphanage\" has instructed him to hand out the notices to everyone he encounters. The letter urges the Dragonborn to consider adoption, either from the orphanage or elsewhere.\nIf an offer is made to adopt a child from Honorhall, she will be delighted, but will ask questions, such as if they have a &lt;a href=\"Homestead%20%28Hearthfire%29\"&gt;house&lt;/a&gt; with a child's bedroom and the prospective new parent's occupation. If a suitable home exists, she says to go and speak to the child they wish to adopt, and promises to get them safely to their new home. Her reaction to the Dragonborn's occupation varies depending on the answer.\nWhether she saw the murder of Grelod or not, Constance will remain in a state of panic from Grelod's death until\u00a0\"&lt;a href=\"Innocence%20Lost\"&gt;Innocence Lost&lt;/a&gt;\"\u00a0is completed by talking to &lt;a href=\"Aventus%20Aretino\"&gt;Aventus Aretino&lt;/a&gt;. However, she will not acknowledge the Dragonborn as the murderer once this questline is completed. If Hearthfire is not yet installed, she will simply state that the children are not up for adoption (since no adoption system is in place) and ask the Dragonborn to leave. If Hearthfire is installed and one asks to adopt a child,\u00a0Constance will not mention Grelod's murder, even if she saw it happen.\nWhile Grelod is alive, the flyer will not be delivered, and it will not be possible to adopt children from Honorhall. If the Dragonborn asks about doing so, Constance will explain that Grelod is the headmistress, and she is not allowing any adoptions. It will still be possible to adopt orphaned children from other places, as long as the Dragonborn has a house with a child's bedroom.\nIf the Dragonborn adopts two kids who are not from the orphanage before Grelod's death, and then kills her under the mission requirements, the notice will never be received.\nConversations.\nGrelod \"Constance!\"\"\nConstance \"Yes, Grelod?\"\nConstance \"Okay, okay. I'll deal with it.\" or \"Please, just let me deal with it. Its not a problem.\" or \"I'll handle it. No need to blow things out of proportion.\" or \"All right. I'll take care of it.\"\""}

They are usually found between large rocks and trees, and aren't usually seen out in the open. Some may be found in cities behind corners of buildings or on the edge of the town wall. Whiterun is one example of a town containing a nest. Occasionally, nests can be found indoors\u2014for example, there are two inside Dustman's Cairn, and one can be found on top of your &lt;a href=\"Homestead%20%28Hearthfire%29\"&gt;homestead&lt;/a&gt; in the Hearthfire expansion.\nBirds' Nests can contain:\nChest.\nUsually the largest storage containers found and they normally contain items of higher value than other containers. Chests can vary in appearance depending on their location. As chests are the \"best\" containers available, the term \"chest\" is often used for any storage container found within a &lt;a href=\"dungeon\"&gt;dungeon&lt;/a&gt;. Chests may be locked or trapped, but never both. The one exception is the locked and trapped chest inside Pinewatch, in the room with the Unusual Gem.\nAll chests have a generally rectangular box shape. The exception to this are &lt;a href=\"Falmer%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Falmer&lt;/a&gt; chests constructed out of &lt;a href=\"chaurus%20chitin\"&gt;chaurus chitin&lt;/a&gt; and these have a distinct appearance but are still recognizable as a chest. \nChests can be made in the homestead with the DLC. Each requires 1 &lt;a href=\"Sawn%20Log\"&gt;Sawn Log&lt;/a&gt;, 1 &lt;a href=\"Nails\"&gt;Nails&lt;/a&gt;, 1 &lt;a href=\"Iron%20Fittings\"&gt;Iron Fittings&lt;/a&gt;, 2 &lt;a href=\"Hinge\"&gt;Hinge&lt;/a&gt;, and 1 &lt;a href=\"Lock%20%28Hearthfire%29\"&gt;Lock&lt;/a&gt;.\nA Legend of Zelda style Chest appears at the top of \"Throat of the World\" or by using the Amiibo only on the Nintendo Switch edition.\nCoffin.\nUsually found in The &lt;a href=\"Hall%20of%20the%20Dead\"&gt;Hall of the Dead&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"Nordic%20Tombs\"&gt;tombs&lt;/a&gt;.

They typically contain &lt;a href=\"Clothing%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;clothing&lt;/a&gt; items, charcoal, rolls of paper, tankards, and, in some cases, gold.\nDraugr.\nSome dead bodies (mostly encountered in crypts and catacombs), only act as containers. A varying amount of gold can be found on them when searched. However, if you see a resting Draugr carrying a weapon, expect a fight with it. A list of such containers are:\nDisplay Case.\nNot a full container \"per se\", but can hold weapons. Items are placed into them (See below) and the glass case can be closed. They are typically found in some &lt;a href=\"Houses%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;purchasable properties&lt;/a&gt; or . Objects placed inside display cases by the player can sometimes spawn outside of them, if the area is re-loaded afterwards. This is similar to how items placed by the player on tables, seats or in bowls can be found on the floor as though leaping out of their containers upon re-entering a house. If using PSVR, players can reach inside the case without unlocking it, allowing for them to grab the item without opening the case.\nDisplay case on low tables can be made in the homestead with the DLC. Requires 2 &lt;a href=\"Sawn%20Log\"&gt;Sawn Log&lt;/a&gt;, 4 &lt;a href=\"Nails\"&gt;Nails&lt;/a&gt;, 1 &lt;a href=\"Hinge\"&gt;Hinge&lt;/a&gt;, and 1 &lt;a href=\"Glass%20%28Hearthfire%29\"&gt;Glass&lt;/a&gt;.\nTo place an item in a display case:\nDrawers.\nUsually contains various &lt;a href=\"Clothing%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;clothing&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Armor%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;armor&lt;/a&gt;, as well as &lt;a href=\"Septim%20%28Coin%29\"&gt;septims&lt;/a&gt; and general clutter (such as charcoal).\nDresser.\nThese are found in almost all houses.

Their eggs typically contain a random number of &lt;a href=\"Spider%20Egg%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Spider Eggs&lt;/a&gt;.\nEnd Table.\nThese are found in almost all houses. They typically contain items of clothing, or sometimes food or gold. End Tables can only have items placed on or in them with a &lt;a href=\"Encumbrance%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Physics Carry&lt;/a&gt;.\nKnapsack.\nThese containers are fairly rare, but can be found in almost any environment. They typically contain a range of items such as &lt;a href=\"Books%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;books&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Ingredients%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;ingredients&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Jewelry%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;jewelry&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Potions%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;potions&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Septim%20%28Coin%29\"&gt;gold&lt;/a&gt;.\nPot.\nThese are found in some houses and shops, and occasionally at &lt;a href=\"Bandits%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;bandit&lt;/a&gt; camps. They typically contain &lt;a href=\"Ingredients%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;alchemy ingredients&lt;/a&gt;, but are often empty.\nSack.\nThese are found nearly everywhere. They typically contain 1\u20135 food items or ingredients.\nSafe.\nQuite rare, but can typically be found in upper-class housing, such as &lt;a href=\"Proudspire%20Manor%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Proudspire Manor&lt;/a&gt;. Also available during the Dark Brotherhood quest to slay the Emperor. Safes can be created in a homestead with the add-on.\nSatchel.\nSmall leather pouches identical to Apothecary's Satchels, with the difference of containing , &lt;a href=\"Lockpick%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;lockpicks&lt;/a&gt; and/or &lt;a href=\"Keys%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;keys&lt;/a&gt;, instead of &lt;a href=\"Ingredients%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;alchemy ingredients&lt;/a&gt;.\nStrongbox.\nStrongboxes are used primarily for &lt;a href=\"Thieves%20Guild%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Thieves Guild&lt;/a&gt; missions. With the various add-ons they can also serve as:\nWardrobe.\nThese are found in almost all houses and will typically contain &lt;a href=\"Clothing%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;clothing&lt;/a&gt; items. Such clothing items will pertain to either &lt;a href=\"fine%20clothes\"&gt;fine clothes&lt;/a&gt; in fine wardrobes or regular clothes in rough wardrobes. \n&lt;a href=\"Burial%20Urn\"&gt;Urn&lt;/a&gt; or Burial Urn.\nThese various sized containers can be found in tombs, ruins, and other places where the dead reside. Typically contain a small amount of &lt;a href=\"Septim%20%28Coin%29\"&gt;gold&lt;/a&gt; and on occasion &lt;a href=\"Jewelry%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;jewelry&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"Potions%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;potions&lt;/a&gt;.\nList of safe containers.\nThe following containers will never reset, thus they are permanently safe to store items.\nMerchant chests.\nAll merchants in Skyrim have a corresponding chest that contains their wares. This chest is a physical item much like a regular chest, however it is typically hidden (often under the floor) and inaccessible in the game world. This is to prevent players from abusing the bartering game mechanic.\nItems within the chest can only be viewed or obtained via the barter menus and the chest will refresh its items every two days.\nAccessible merchant chests.\nIn &lt;a href=\"Dawnstar%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Dawnstar&lt;/a&gt;, to the north of &lt;a href=\"Iron-Breaker%20Mine\"&gt;Iron-Breaker Mine&lt;/a&gt; there is an accessible merchant chest underneath a small rock overhang. This chest belongs to &lt;a href=\"Ahkari\"&gt;Ahkari&lt;/a&gt;. Like all merchant chests, this chest should not be accessible, but its position is bugged. The items in this chest can be freely taken without the player being charged with a crime.\nSimilar to Ahkari's chest, &lt;a href=\"Ma%27dran\"&gt;Ma'dran's&lt;/a&gt; merchant chest is available for searching. It is located outside of Markarth behind the first stone wall on the right when traveling on foot towards &lt;a href=\"Kolskeggr%20Mine%20%28Location%29\"&gt;Kolskeggr Mine&lt;/a&gt;. The items within can be taken freely with no repercussions, as well.\nIn &lt;a href=\"Whiterun%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Whiterun&lt;/a&gt;, underneath the &lt;a href=\"Skyforge%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Skyforge&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Eorlund%20Gray-Mane\"&gt;Eorlund Gray-Mane&lt;/a&gt;'s merchant chest is accessible.\nIn the &lt;a href=\"Blue%20Palace%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Blue Palace&lt;/a&gt;, the court mage's chest is accessible by using items such as plates, bowls or platters to go through the wall in the basement hallway. However, almost all items taken from this chest will be marked as stolen, thus can only be sold to &lt;a href=\"Fence%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Fences&lt;/a&gt;. The only way around this is to complete &lt;a href=\"The%20Man%20Who%20Cried%20Wolf\"&gt;The Man Who Cried Wolf&lt;/a&gt; quest to clear the stolen tag.\nSimilar to the Blue Palace, there is also one accessible by items (as above) in &lt;a href=\"the%20Ragged%20Flagon\"&gt;the Ragged Flagon&lt;/a&gt;.\nAs well, using items mentioned above, &lt;a href=\"Moth%20gro-Bagol\"&gt;Moth gro-Bagol's&lt;/a&gt; chest in &lt;a href=\"Understone%20Keep%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Understone Keep&lt;/a&gt; is accessible. Taking items from this chest may sometimes cause the guards to arrest the player unless done while in stealth mode with high &lt;a href=\"Sneak%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Sneak&lt;/a&gt;.\nAll chests in the &lt;a href=\"Hall%20of%20Countenance\"&gt;Hall of Countenance&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Hall%20of%20Attainment\"&gt;Hall of Attainment&lt;/a&gt; can be looted using a plate, platter, or bowl. The chests in the Hall of Countenance can be glitched to by going through the wall between the room with the dining table and the main area on the first floor. Furthermore, the chests in the Hall of Attainment can be glitched to from under the stairwell or from the far wall of &lt;a href=\"Tolfdir%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Tolfdir's&lt;/a&gt; room. However, all items will have the stolen tag. Nonetheless, it is an easy way to learn the available spells, as the spell tomes are destroyed after reading.\nDo Not Delete.\nThe \"&lt;a href=\"Do%20Not%20Delete\"&gt;Do Not Delete&lt;/a&gt;\" chest is a scripted placeholder left in-game by developers to represent the total gold-value &lt;a href=\"Merchants%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;merchants&lt;/a&gt; can hold. This is the box that essentially \"allows\" an NPC to be a merchant. It does not contain anything, the only reason it exists is to allow the merchants to sell their items.\nIt isn't known why it is a chest, rather than a line of code within the game's programming. These are only deletable on PC. If deleted, most merchants will cease to function altogether, although it may sometimes \"break\" their shop menu, meaning it can be opened, but it does not work.\nDo Not Delete chests can be stacked in the air in a manner similar to the &lt;a href=\"paintbrush\"&gt;paintbrush&lt;/a&gt;es of ."}

The town of Winterhold may be affected as well, and needs to be secured.\"\nWalkthrough.\nA Plague on Winterhold.\nAfter the explosion, Mirabelle Ervine can be found sitting by one of the columns in the &lt;a href=\"Hall%20of%20the%20Elements\"&gt;Hall of the Elements&lt;/a&gt;. Ancano remains with the Eye of Magnus, protected by strong magic.\nMirabelle will ask the Dragonborn to find &lt;a href=\"Savos%20Aren\"&gt;Savos Aren&lt;/a&gt;, who was knocked away by the explosion. When Dovahkiin steps out to the courtyard, a crowd is forming around a body. &lt;a href=\"Tolfdir%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Tolfdir&lt;/a&gt; confirms the shocking news: the Arch-Mage has succumbed to the wounds he suffered during the battle with Ancano. However, there is another, more important matter. Winterhold is being overrun. Magic anomalies appeared there and are attacking the townsfolk.\nRunning on the bridge out of the College, &lt;a href=\"Faralda%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Faralda&lt;/a&gt; will stop the player and ask to be told what happened. She can be recruited to help, before asking &lt;a href=\"Arniel%20Gane\"&gt;Arniel Gane&lt;/a&gt; to join the fight herself.\nThe ten Magic Anomalies are easily spotted and quickly removed, hissing and floating about like &lt;a href=\"Ice%20Wraith%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;ice wraiths&lt;/a&gt;. Ranged magic is a good choice, but pinpoint spells (such as &lt;a href=\"Firebolt%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Firebolt&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"Ice%20Spike%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Ice Spike&lt;/a&gt;) that do not hit the fleeing townsfolk who are under Magic Anomalies' attack work best. Melee weapons, such as &lt;a href=\"Bound%20Sword%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;bound swords&lt;/a&gt; and \"conventional\" weapons like &lt;a href=\"Daggers%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;daggers&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"War%20Axes%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;war axes&lt;/a&gt; will also do nicely.\nOne strategy is to draw the anomalies away from the townsfolk, leaving Faralda and Arniel to deal with them. However, if the anomalies are dealt with during the night, when everyone is indoors, it makes things much easier to protect the townsfolk as the only casualties will be the &lt;a href=\"Chicken%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;chickens&lt;/a&gt; outside &lt;a href=\"The%20Frozen%20Hearth\"&gt;The Frozen Hearth&lt;/a&gt;. If is installed, a &lt;a href=\"Master%20Vampire\"&gt;Master Vampire&lt;/a&gt; and either his &lt;a href=\"Vampire%27s%20Thrall\"&gt;thralls&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"Death%20Hound%20%28Dawnguard%29\"&gt;death hounds&lt;/a&gt; or a group of\u00a0Dawnguard warriors may choose to help and focus on the anomalies as well before possibly turning their attention to the Dragonborn. If Faralda is here when the ten magical foes are dead, she shouts that she will stay here and check for any more incursions. The defeated anomalies leave behind ghostly remains that have &lt;a href=\"Soul%20Gem%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;soul gems&lt;/a&gt; to be looted.\nAfter all the anomalies are defeated, the quest continues by returning to the College and seeking out Mirabelle, letting her know that Winterhold is safe for now. She wishes she could say the same for the College. While she attempts to keep the Eye of Magnus contained with her fellow mages, she asks the Dragonborn to locate the &lt;a href=\"Staff%20of%20Magnus%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Staff of Magnus&lt;/a&gt;.\nWhen the Dragonborn mentions they are off to &lt;a href=\"Labyrinthian%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Labyrinthian&lt;/a&gt;, Mirabelle is taken aback: The Arch-Mage gave her an item from this place and told her she would know what to do with it. She gives the Dragonborn the &lt;a href=\"Torc%20of%20Labyrinthian\"&gt;Torc of Labyrinthian&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Savos%20Aren%27s%20Amulet\"&gt;Savos Aren's Amulet&lt;/a&gt;. This ends this quest and begins the next, \"&lt;a href=\"The%20Staff%20of%20Magnus%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;The Staff of Magnus&lt;/a&gt;.\""}

The Duke's first task for the Nerevarine is to help regain control over the &lt;a href=\"Ordinator%20%28Morrowind%29\"&gt;Ordinators&lt;/a&gt;.

The Nerevarine must then return the robe to Saryoni, whom will agree to speak with &lt;a href=\"Berel%20Sala\"&gt;Berel Sala&lt;/a&gt; (head of the Ordinators) about the Ordinators.

There are three different movement speeds in the game, which listed from slowest to fastest are as follows: walking, running/jogging, and sprinting (the only one to drain &lt;a href=\"Stamina%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;stamina&lt;/a&gt;). Players can also &lt;a href=\"Sneak%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;sneak&lt;/a&gt; in a relatively slow movement state. Various other controls allow the player to interact with the game world in more complex ways.\nThe term \"toggle\" means to set as the default behavior between two or more options. For example, the player can run normally, or they can sneak; pressing Ctrl on PC \"toggles\" this behavior. If the player's controls are set to have them run by default, then toggling this control sets sneaking as their default movement behavior. If it is pressed again, then running is set as the default movement behavior.\nDefault controls.\nThe following shows the default controls for each platform.\nQuick Keys and dual wielding.\nXbox - To assign a Quick Key on the Xbox 360;\nSpells.\nPress the quick key a second time to &lt;a href=\"dual-wield\"&gt;dual-wield&lt;/a&gt; spells - &lt;a href=\"Spells%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;spells&lt;/a&gt; will default to the left hand while &lt;a href=\"Weapons%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;weapons&lt;/a&gt; default to the right hand.\nMelee weapons.\nMelee Weapons can't be dual-wielded using quick keys. Unless it's a stackable weapon, pressing the quick key a second time will only replace the previous weapon.\nSome &lt;a href=\"Enchanted%20Weapons%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;enchanted weapons&lt;/a&gt; are stackable at first but if the charge levels become different they cease to be stackable and the quick keys can no longer be used for dual-wielding.\nBows.\nBows are sheathed, unsheathed, equipped, and unequipped as other weapons - by pressing the sheath/unsheathe button (default, R, on PCs). To remove an arrow from a loaded bow without shooting it, press the sheath/unsheathe weapon button. Hold down the right hand button to ready an arrow; how far the arrow will go is determined by how far back the string is drawn, which itself is determined by how long the right hand button is held (up to some maximum which appears to be a few seconds holding - this may be dependent on Marksman level). The arrow will be shot in a trajectory similar to that of a thrown baseball. The arrow goes upwards a little bit for some distance, and then comes back down. The trajectory of the arrow depends on the weight of the bow.\nFor Xbox360 players that have Kinect, here is a link to the Kinect Voice Commands. &lt;a href=\"http%3A//cdnstatic.bethsoft.com/akqacms/files/tes/extras/skyrim-kinect-voice-commands.pdf\"&gt;Kinect &lt;/a&gt;"}

My thanks for your attendance. We call this meeting together to determine the proper care and\u2014\n&lt;Maestro Taenival stands abruptly.&gt;\nTaenival: Care and imprisonment? Not on my life! You ruin an instrument's vitality by locking it in a box!\nCatrelle: Good Maestro Taenival! I'll quarter no outbursts at this meeting! Make your winds smaller for a time, sir!\nTaenival: You'll not change my mind on this subject.\nCatrelle: So noted. Please be at ease, Maestro.\n&lt;Taenival sits, looking angry.&gt;\nCatrelle: As I was saying, we gather to discuss our intentions for these legendary, storied, and exquisite instruments before us. Those the college has collected over the course of centuries and maintained. Some of the bards outside this room, and indeed within, have used them extensively to teach with and compose upon. Due to complaints by others, also within and without \u2026.\n&lt;Many grumbles and side-glances.&gt;\nCatrelle: \u2026 there is concern that this could have undue negative impact upon the instruments. Most recently, we have had to perform extensive repair on the &lt;a href=\"Tom%20of%20Shilsk\"&gt;Tom of Shilsk&lt;/a&gt; when someone\u2014\nHrofgen: That was not my fault, and I was NOT drunk, as it was implied!\nViatrix: I SAW you refilling your brandy flask right before the Tom was broken!\nHrofgen: I do not deny this, but I was not drunk. It slipped and fell when a student tripped over me. While I napped. On top of the drum.\nViatrix: Sloven\u2014\nCatrelle: Enough! We're not here to litigate your passions. We need solutions. Maestro Efnort has a prepared statement. Efnort?\n&lt;Efnort stands.&gt;\nEfnort: For the record, I've seen Hrofgen refill his brandy flask before delivering a wandering soliloquy on drums that stunned everyone in the room. I count this as no excuse for the damage to the Tom, and therefore advocate for the preservation of our artifacts.\n&lt;Efnort clears his throat, looks sternly at Hrofgen.&gt;\nEfnort: These instruments represent a legacy of musical history. The Bards College should want to preserve them for as long as possible, to show students, tourists, luthiers, and other crafters these masterworks and pieces of cultural history.\n&lt;Thaezara stands.&gt;\nThaezara: Efnort, you must admit that an instrument is like a lover. Is it not at its most beauteous when plucked, strummed, and played until singing joyously? Caged, they are left silent and lonesome, no?\n&lt;Efnort shifts uncomfortably. Maybe the rumors about he and Thaezara are true?&gt;\nEfnort: Thaezara, esteemed one. Though you make a passionate plea, I am more inclined to be delicate with such an instrument. Revered. It having given so much to Nirn already. Does it not deserve reverence? It simply cannot be played forever.\nThaezara: You should be so lucky to have an instrument in such fine condition that it begs to ring out its song!\n&lt;Thaezara is near shouting. Efnort sits down timidly.&gt;\nViatrix: However fine the condition of the instrument, Thaezara, it won't matter if every student at the college is pawing it and noodling every terrible sonnet they can imagine upon it.\nThaezara: How dare you\u2014\n&lt;Thaezara jumps at Viatrix and tries to claw her face!&gt;\nCatrelle: Enough! Sit down, the both of you!\n&lt;Catrelle breaks up a minor fight between Viatrix and Thaezara. Efnort looks away.&gt;\nCatrelle: Stop being so dramatic! &lt;a href=\"Tamriel\"&gt;Tamriel&lt;/a&gt;'s bards look to us to make mature decisions for the culture of bards as a whole. Act like you deserve the honor!\nTwains-the-Night: If you truly mean all bards, then let me be the Argonian representative to express my dismay in your needs to preserve everything in a world where all things eventually return to &lt;a href=\"Nirn\"&gt;Nirn&lt;/a&gt;. In our land, nothing survives time or the &lt;a href=\"Black%20Marsh%20%28Online%29\"&gt;marsh&lt;/a&gt;. We make use of everything, and if something has no use, we commit it again to the swamp.\nHrofgen: Exactly! I think what the scaleback means, in regular words, is that we should make use of these great instruments while we have them. Eventually they will be stolen, or burned, or have something spilled on them, you know?\nTwains: Scaleback?\nCatrelle: Order!\n&lt;Continued in &lt;a href=\"Convergence%20of%20Maestros%2C%20Volume%202\"&gt;Volume 2&lt;/a&gt;.&gt;"}

Cooking can be accomplished through the use of &lt;a href=\"Cooking%20Place\"&gt;cooking pots and spits&lt;/a&gt; found in locations throughout the province. Food from cooking can restore magicka, health, or stamina and grant temporary effects determined by the recipe. The recipes require items such as raw meats, vegetables, and &lt;a href=\"Ingredients%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;alchemical ingredients&lt;/a&gt; (especially &lt;a href=\"salt%20pile\"&gt;salt pile&lt;/a&gt;s). Characters start the game knowing every possible cooking recipe.\nCooking is a basic method of living off the land. Most of the food the &lt;a href=\"Last%20Dragonborn\"&gt;Dragonborn&lt;/a&gt; can cook typically restores five to ten points of &lt;a href=\"Health%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Health&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"Stamina%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Stamina&lt;/a&gt;. This is less than the healing from a &lt;a href=\"Potions%20%28Skyrim%29%23Restore%20Health\"&gt;minor potion&lt;/a&gt;. As alchemical skills improve, some cooked food may have less real value than the ingredients put into it.\nHowever, those with low &lt;a href=\"Alchemy%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;alchemy skill&lt;/a&gt; may benefit more from cooking than producing their own healing potions. Very long duration effects (12 minutes) can be produced as well, which can extend the time before one tires from power attacks or running and generally reduce the need to enter a menu to heal with other items. Due to the abundance of free food that can be obtained, making use of cooking can save a significant amount of money over time as well."}

It can be summed up in one word: Recipes! When you have a recipe for a dish -- especially if it comes from the Malachite Chef! -- it takes all the guesswork out of preparing a meal. So beg, borrow, or steal (I jest, I jest) some recipes, acquire the necessary ingredients, and combine as directed over a hot cook-fire. You'll be a master provisioner in no time!\nBecause I'll let you in on a little professional secret: nineteen out of twenty times, even top-ranked chefs do exactly the same thing! Oh, we may add a special spice here or there to personalize a recipe, but we know better than to ignore them entirely. A proven recipe represents the collective experience of generations of cooks. Whether you're making something as simple as a Cyrodilic &lt;a href=\"Sweetroll%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Sweet roll&lt;/a&gt; or as complicated as a screaming-cheese fondue, in the kitchen a recipe is your best friend!"}

Some cooking spits can be encountered with a &lt;a href=\"Charred%20Skeever%20Hide\"&gt;charred skeever&lt;/a&gt; on it which can be \"harvested,\" but the spit is not usable for cooking."}

Don't be so hard on Avenicci.\"\nProventus: \"I meant no disrespect, of course. It's just that... what do these Greybeards want with ?\"\nBalgruuf: \"That's the Greybeards' business, not ours. Whatever happened when killed that dragon, it revealed something in you, and the Greybeards heard it. If they think you're Dragonborn, who are we to argue? You'd better get up to High Hrothgar immediately. There's no refusing the summons of the Greybeards, it's a tremendous honor. I envy you, you know. To climb the 7,000 Steps again... I made the pilgrimage once, did you know that? High Hrothgar is a very peaceful place. Very... disconnected from the troubles of this world. I wonder that the Greybeards even notice what's going on down here. They haven't seemed to care before. No matter. Go to High Hrothgar. Learn what the Greybeards can teach you.\"\nAfter another brief conversation:\nBalgruuf: \"Back to business, Proventus. We still have a city to defend.\"\nProventus: \"Yes, my lord.\"\n&lt;a href=\"Message%20to%20Whiterun\"&gt;Message to Whiterun&lt;/a&gt;.\nAfter being given Ulfric's axe or General Tullius' Message, Jarl Balgruuf will discuss the matter with Proventus and Irileth in a lengthy conversation:\nBalgruuf: \"Proventus, what do you make of all this? If Ulfric were to attack Whiterun...\"\nProventus: \"As in all things, lord, caution... I urge us to wait and see.\"\nIrileth: \"Prey waits.\"\nBalgruuf: \"I'm of a mind with Irileth. It's time to act.\"\nProventus: \"You plan to march on Windhelm?\"\nBalgruuf: \"I'm not a fool, Proventus. I mean it's time to challenge Ulfric to face me as a man, or march his Stormcloaks up to the gates.\"\nProventus: \"He'll do no such thing! A dagger in the back is all you could expect!\"\nIrileth: \"He was rather straightforward with Torygg.\"\nProventus: \"Torygg? He simply walked up to the boy and murdered him!\"\nIrileth: \"\"That \"boy\" was High King of Skyrim.\"\nBalgruuf: \"I'm not the High King, but neither am I a boy. If Ulfric wants to challenge my rule in the Old Way, let him. Though, I suspect he'll prefer to send his \"Stormcloaks\" to do it for him.\"\"\nIrileth: \"True. He's already proven his personal strength. Now he seeks to prove his army's.\"\nProventus: \"Then might I urge you to consider General Tullius' request? I mean, if you are bent on offending Jarl Ulfric...\"\nIrileth: \"Ulfric is the one who has offended. But, Proventus has a point. Ulfric has made it clear; in his mind, to refuse his claim is to side with the Empire.\"\nProventus: \"And what harm is there in letting a few Legionnaires die in place of your own men?\"\nBalgruuf: \"It seems cowardly.\"\nIrileth: \"Was it cowardly then to accept the White-Gold Concordat?\"\nBalgruuf: \"This again? That was different. Was I given a chance to object to the terms of the treaty? No. The Jarls weren't asked. We were told. And we had to like it.\"\nProventus: \"The chests of gold didn't hurt.\"\nBalgruuf: \"Damnit! This isn't about gold!\"\nIrileth: \"It's time to decide.\"\nProventus: \"Lord, wait. Let us see if Ulfric is serious.\"\nBalgruuf: \"Oh, he's serious. But so am I.\"\nIrileth: \"Finally.\"\nProventus will then be involved in another, shorter, conversation cementing Balgruuf's decision to side with the Imperials:\nBalgruuf: \"Proventus. Bring me my pen. And the good parchment.\"\nProventus: \"Are we writing a letter, Lord?\"\nBalgruuf: \"Yes, to General Tullius. I need to make a few things clear before I accept these Legionnaires of his.\"\nBalgruuf the Greater.\nProventus: \"My lord, our provisions are running dangerously low. Our stores of meat, wine, and grain are all but depleted.\"\nBalgruuf: \"Purchase more supplies, then. That's your job as Steward, isn't it? Why do you trouble me with these details?\"\nProventus: \"My lord, since Ulfric Stormcloak's uprising, the cost of goods has doubled. I'll need more coin if I'm to provision us properly.\"\nBalgruuf: \"Our coffers are nearly empty. I can scarcely afford to pay the guards, and we need every one of them in these troubled times. You'll have to make do with what we have, Proventus.\"\nProventus: \"Yes, my lord.\"\nIrileth.\nIrileth: \"I am concerned about the Jarl's safety. Too many of our guards have been redeployed to fight the Stormcloaks.\"\nProventus: \"What would you have me do? If we do not send men to fight in the war, you'll find yourself guarding one of Ulfric's men.\"\nIrileth: \"And if an assassin slips past the night watch, we won't have a Jarl at all. Without Balgruuf's leadership, Whiterun will descend into chaos.\"\nProventus: \"Nonsense. If Balgruuf falls, someone will take his place, for better or worse. In the meantime, we have a war to win. And win we must.\"\nHrongar.\nHrongar: \"Proventus, you must help me. We need to convince my brother to do more for the war effort.\"\nProventus: \"What would you have me do, Hrongar? Your brother is the Jarl. You know I can't question his judgement.\"\nHrongar: \"I'm not asking you to defy the Jarl, just to open his eyes. Use subtlety and suggestion to turn his thoughts to the war. You're his steward, he'll listen to you.\"\nProventus: \"Leave me out of your intrigues, Hrongar. If you have something to say to the Jarl, say it with your own tongue.\"\nProventus: \"My lord Jarl, if we do not take steps soon, our coffers will be empty.\"\nHrongar: \"Raise the taxes, then! Put anyone that refuses to pay in the stocks and make an example of them.\"\nProventus: \"As you command, my lord. But, the issue could be solved another way. If we spend less on new arms and armor for the guards, for example...\"\nHrongar: \"We're at war, old fool, or have you forgotten?

All provinces have been ruled by the Empire simultaneously at some point. However, this unity begins to fade in the second century of the &lt;a href=\"Fourth%20Era\"&gt;Fourth Era&lt;/a&gt;.\nProvinces.\nBlack Marsh.\nThis huge, mostly uncharted region of densely vegetated wetlands is at the southeastern tip of Tamriel. &lt;a href=\"Argonians\"&gt;Argonians&lt;/a&gt; thrive in the foreboding swamps and thick brush, thanks to their amphibious underwater breathing abilities and very high resistance to disease.\nCyrodiil.\nLying in the center of Tamriel, Cyrodiil is home of the human &lt;a href=\"Imperials\"&gt;Imperials&lt;/a&gt;. Cyrodiil is mostly an expanse of forest and mountains. At its heart is the &lt;a href=\"Nibenay%20Valley\"&gt;Nibenay Valley&lt;/a&gt;, a vast plain enclosed by equatorial rain forests. Many rivers flow through this area, and as one ventures further south, the land slowly becomes increasingly sub-tropical. For most of the Elder Scrolls games, it is the seat of the &lt;a href=\"Empire\"&gt;Empire&lt;/a&gt;. Cyrodiil is the setting for the game .\nElsweyr.\nDivided across arid badlands to the north and a lush, more populous sub-tropical zone in the south, this region marks the southern coast of Tamriel. Elsweyr is home to the &lt;a href=\"Khajiit\"&gt;Khajiit&lt;/a&gt;.\nHammerfell.\nLying in west Tamriel, this province is dominated by the &lt;a href=\"Alik%27r%20Desert\"&gt;Alik'r Desert&lt;/a&gt;. Hammerfell is home to the &lt;a href=\"Redguard\"&gt;Redguard&lt;/a&gt; human race. The northern region of Hammerfell is part of the setting for the game .\nHigh Rock.\nHome to the human &lt;a href=\"Bretons\"&gt;Bretons&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Orsimer\"&gt;Orcs&lt;/a&gt;, this province is divided into multiple Breton city-states and minor kingdoms. It is a temperate coastal region in northwestern Tamriel. The southern region of High Rock is part of the setting for the game \"Daggerfall\".\nMorrowind.\nThe province in the northeast corner of Tamriel and home to the &lt;a href=\"Dunmer\"&gt;Dunmer&lt;/a&gt; (Dark Elves). It consists of a continental mainland and a large island in the center called &lt;a href=\"Vvardenfell\"&gt;Vvardenfell&lt;/a&gt;, separated by an inlet from the &lt;a href=\"Sea%20of%20Ghosts\"&gt;Sea of Ghosts&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"Inner%20Sea\"&gt;Inner Sea&lt;/a&gt;. Vvardenfell is the setting for the game, . There is also an island to the north west of Morrowind called &lt;a href=\"Solstheim\"&gt;Solstheim&lt;/a&gt;, which is the setting for both 's add-on, and 's third add-on, .\nSkyrim.\nThis northern, snow-covered and mountainous region is home to the &lt;a href=\"Nord\"&gt;Nord&lt;/a&gt; human race, as well as the &lt;a href=\"Falmer\"&gt;Falmer&lt;/a&gt; mer race (&lt;a href=\"Snow%20Elves\"&gt;Snow Elves&lt;/a&gt;). Skyrim contains some of the tallest mountains in all of Tamriel, most notably the &lt;a href=\"Throat%20of%20the%20World\"&gt;Throat of the World&lt;/a&gt;. Skyrim is less urbanized than Cyrodiil, but the &lt;a href=\"Holds\"&gt;five largest cities&lt;/a&gt; do have sizable population, with the other four cities being more like towns. Skyrim is the setting for .\nSummerset Isles.\nThis province is located in the &lt;a href=\"Eltheric%20Ocean\"&gt;Eltheric Ocean&lt;/a&gt;, with the &lt;a href=\"Abecean%20Sea\"&gt;Abecean Sea&lt;/a&gt; separating the islands from the mainland Tamriel continent. It is composed of three islands, one large western main island and one smaller named Auridon with another unknown location likely immediately south of Valenwood and east of Auridon. These islands are home to the &lt;a href=\"Altmer\"&gt;Altmer&lt;/a&gt; (High Elves).\nValenwood.\nThe province in the south-western region of Tamriel. This province is largely uninhabited forest wilderness. The coasts are dominated by mangrove swamps and tropical rain forests, while heavy rainfalls nurture the temperate inland rain forests. Valenwood is home to the &lt;a href=\"Bosmer\"&gt;Bosmer&lt;/a&gt; (Wood Elves)."}

Morrowind was among the last of the provinces to be integrated into the Empire, and because it was &lt;a href=\"Treaty%20of%20the%20Armistice\"&gt;added by treaty&lt;/a&gt;, and not by conquest, Morrowind retains exceptional power to define local law by reference to ancient &lt;a href=\"Great%20House\"&gt;Great House&lt;/a&gt; precedents.\n&lt;a href=\"Skyrim\"&gt;Skyrim&lt;/a&gt;, also known as the Old Kingdom or the Fatherland, was the first region of Tamriel settled by humans from the continent of &lt;a href=\"Atmora\"&gt;Atmora&lt;/a&gt;: the hardy, brave, warlike &lt;a href=\"Nords\"&gt;Nords&lt;/a&gt;, whose descendants still occupy this rugged land. Though more restrained and civilized than their barbarian ancestors, the Nords of the pure blood still excel in the manly virtues of red war and bold exploration.\n&lt;a href=\"Hammerfell\"&gt;Hammerfell&lt;/a&gt; is primarily an urban and maritime province, with most of its population confined to the great cities of &lt;a href=\"Sentinel\"&gt;Sentinel&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Stros%20M%27Kai\"&gt;Stros M'Kai&lt;/a&gt; and to other small ports among the islands and along the coast. The interior is sparsely populated with small poor farms and beastherds. The &lt;a href=\"Redguard\"&gt;Redguard&lt;/a&gt; love of travel, adventure, and the high seas has dispersed them as sailors, mercenaries, and adventurers in ports of call throughout the Empire.\n&lt;a href=\"High%20Rock\"&gt;High Rock&lt;/a&gt; encompasses the many lands and clans of &lt;a href=\"Greater%20Bretony\"&gt;Greater Bretony&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"Dellese%20Isles\"&gt;Dellese Isles&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"Bjoulsae%20River\"&gt;Bjoulsae River&lt;/a&gt; tribes, and, by tradition, the &lt;a href=\"Western%20Reach\"&gt;Western Reach&lt;/a&gt;. The rugged highland strongholds and isolated valley settlements have encouraged the fierce independence of the various local Breton clans, and this contentious tribal nature has never been completely integrated into a provincial or Imperial identity. Nonetheless, their language, bardic traditions, and heroic legends are a unifying common legacy.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Summerset%20Isle\"&gt;Summerset Isle&lt;/a&gt; is a green and pleasant land of fertile farmlands, woodland parks, and ancient towers and manors. Most settlements are small and isolated, and dominated by ruling seats of the local wizard or warlord. The Isle has few good natural ports, and the natives are unwelcoming to foreigners, so the ancient, chivalric high culture of the &lt;a href=\"Aldmer\"&gt;Aldmer&lt;/a&gt; is little affected by modern Imperial mercantilism.\n&lt;a href=\"Valenwood\"&gt;Valenwood&lt;/a&gt; is a largely uninhabited forest wilderness. The coasts of Valenwood are dominated by mangrove swamps and tropical rain forests, while heavy rainfalls nurture the temperate inland rain forests. The &lt;a href=\"Bosmer\"&gt;Bosmer&lt;/a&gt; live in timber clanhouses at sites scattered along the coast and through the interior, connected only by undeveloped foot trails. The few Imperial roads traverse vast dense woodlands, studded with tiny, widely separated settlements, and carry little trade or traffic of any kind.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Khajiit\"&gt;Khajiit&lt;/a&gt; of the southern &lt;a href=\"Elsweyr\"&gt;Elsweyr&lt;/a&gt; jungles and river basins are settled city dwellers with ancient mercantile traditions and a stable agrarian aristocracy based on sugarcane and &lt;a href=\"saltrice\"&gt;saltrice&lt;/a&gt; plantations. The nomadic tribal Khajiit of the dry northern wastes and grasslands are, by contrast, aggressive and territorial tribal raiders periodically united under tribal warlords. While the settled south has been quick to adopt Imperial ways, the northern nomadic tribes cling to their warlike barbarian traditions.\nMost of the native &lt;a href=\"Argonian\"&gt;Argonian&lt;/a&gt; population of &lt;a href=\"Black%20Marsh\"&gt;Black Marsh&lt;/a&gt; is confined to the great inland waterways and impenetrable swamps of the southern interior. There are few roads here, and most travel is by boat. The coasts and the northwestern upland forests are largely uninhabited. For ages the &lt;a href=\"Dunmer\"&gt;Dunmer&lt;/a&gt; have raided Black Marsh for slaves; though the Empire has made this illegal, the practice persists, and Dunmer and Argonians have a long-standing and bitter hatred for one another.\n&lt;a href=\"Morrowind\"&gt;Morrowind&lt;/a&gt;, homeland of the &lt;a href=\"Dunmer\"&gt;Dunmer&lt;/a&gt; peoples, is the northeastmost province of the Tamrielic Empire. Most of the population is gathered in the high uplands and fertile river valleys of central Morrowind, especially around the Inland Sea. The island &lt;a href=\"Vvardenfell\"&gt;Vvardenfell&lt;/a&gt; is encircled by the &lt;a href=\"Inner%20Sea\"&gt;Inner Sea&lt;/a&gt;, and is dominated by the titanic volcano &lt;a href=\"Red%20Mountain\"&gt;Red Mountain&lt;/a&gt; and its associated ash wastelands; most of the island's population is confined to the relatively hospitable west and southwest coast.\n&lt;a href=\"Cyrodiil\"&gt;Cyrodiil&lt;/a&gt; is the cradle of Human Imperial high culture on Tamriel. It is the largest region of the continent, and most is endless jungle. The &lt;a href=\"Imperial%20City\"&gt;Imperial City&lt;/a&gt; is in the heartland, the fertile &lt;a href=\"Nibenay%20Valley\"&gt;Nibenay Valley&lt;/a&gt;. The densely populated central valley is surrounded by wild rain forests drained by great rivers into the swamps of Argonia and &lt;a href=\"Topal%20Bay\"&gt;Topal Bay&lt;/a&gt;. The land rises gradually to the west and sharply to the north. Between its western coast and its central valley are deciduous forests and mangrove swamps.\nTrivia.\nThe book is mentioned in a loading screen tip in , despite not appearing in the game."}

I'm to retrieve a fragment of Wuuthrad, the Blade of Ysgramor, from Dustman's Cairn while Farkas judges my valor.\"\nWalkthrough.\nThe quest begins by speaking to Skjor after completing the radiant quest \"&lt;a href=\"Trouble%20in%20Skyrim\"&gt;Trouble in Skyrim&lt;/a&gt;\" given by Farkas at the end of \"&lt;a href=\"Take%20Up%20Arms\"&gt;Take Up Arms&lt;/a&gt;.\" He tells the &lt;a href=\"Last%20Dragonborn\"&gt;Dragonborn&lt;/a&gt; that one more quest must be completed before becoming a full-fledged member of the &lt;a href=\"The%20Companions\"&gt;Companions&lt;/a&gt;. During the trial, &lt;a href=\"Farkas\"&gt;Farkas&lt;/a&gt; will assess the Dragonborn's progress. The Dragonborn should next talk to Farkas and agree to meet him at &lt;a href=\"Dustman%27s%20Cairn\"&gt;Dustman's Cairn&lt;/a&gt;. Temporarily, Farkas will replace any existing &lt;a href=\"Followers%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;follower&lt;/a&gt;. Any follower will then return to their home location.\nDustman's Cairn.\nThe entrance is a bit hard to see. If Farkas was asked to be met there, he stands on the path beside rocks that are difficult to climb. Up the small hill is a ring of stones surrounding a pit. At the south end of the pit is a set of stairs leading down into the pit. The entrance is near the bottom of the stairs. Upon entering the first room, Farkas says it looks like \"someone has been digging here... and recently. Tread lightly.\"\nThe path leads to a room where &lt;a href=\"Leveled%20Creatures%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;leveled&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Draugr%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;draugr&lt;/a&gt; reside. After killing them and proceeding through the wooden door, the path leads down to a large cavern with a lever in the middle of an adjoining room. Pulling that lever will close the exit, trapping the Dragonborn inside. This triggers a cutscene in which Farkas is confronted by bandits of the group known as the &lt;a href=\"Silver%20Hand\"&gt;Silver Hand&lt;/a&gt;, and reveals himself to be a &lt;a href=\"Lycanthropy%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;werewolf&lt;/a&gt;. After the scene, Farkas should be spoken to about what happened. During this leg of the quest, Farkas does not aid the Dragonborn in battle. Only in the last room of the cairn does he assist in battle. This may be level dependent \u2013 when the Dragonborn is at higher levels, Farkas seems to hang back and watch, but once combat is initiated, Farkas will pursue and attack any fleeing draugr or Silver Hand members and finish them off. He will provide substantial assistance to a lower leveled Dragonborn even before the final room.\nContinuing through the caves, members of the Silver Hand attack. After proceeding through two wooden doors, there are Silver Hands inside to be dispatched. The path continues up the stairs, past the &lt;a href=\"burial%20urn\"&gt;burial urn&lt;/a&gt;s to the next room, and through the wooden door. Two &lt;a href=\"Containers%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;chests&lt;/a&gt; may be found in front of the stairs. One can be found by pulling the chain found on the left side of the left hand wall, opening a passage to the chest. The second can be found in the hallway near the front of the stairs amongst the rubble along with a bag of coins behind the left door. Silver Hands and draugr will be encountered along the way until the door to Dustman's Crypt is reached.\nDustman's Crypt.\nUpon entering the crypt, more Silver Hand members attack. After they are dispatched, a side door leads to a path across the bridge, then down to the right, with Silver Hand and draugr to be fought on the way toward the crypt. The draugr can be easily dispatched using &lt;a href=\"Destruction%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Destruction&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Spell%20Tomes%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;spells&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Arrows%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;arrows&lt;/a&gt;, or &lt;a href=\"Weapons%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;melee weapons&lt;/a&gt; with long reach. This causes them to die before being woken, leaving only the Silver Hands to deal with.\nAfter this, a large room with a chest containing &lt;a href=\"Dustman%27s%20Cairn%20Key\"&gt;Dustman's Cairn Key&lt;/a&gt; appears, off to the left upon entering the room; this opens the iron door ahead. There are several &lt;a href=\"Skeever%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;skeevers&lt;/a&gt; down the path. The next room contains two &lt;a href=\"Frostbite%20Spider%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;frostbite spiders&lt;/a&gt;, followed by several draugr. It also contains an\u00a0&lt;a href=\"Alchemy%20Lab%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Alchemy Lab&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe next iron door leads to a larger room. On the altar lies the fragment needed to complete the quest. Behind the altar is a &lt;a href=\"Word%20Walls%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Word Wall&lt;/a&gt; that teaches a new Word of Power for &lt;a href=\"Fire%20Breath%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Fire Breath&lt;/a&gt;\u00a0when approached. After retrieving the fragment, several leveled draugr appear. At higher levels most of the enemies are &lt;a href=\"Draugr%20Deathlord%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;draugr deathlords&lt;/a&gt;, and may appear if the Dragonborn is level 12. When facing higher level enemies, Farkas is of little help, and his &lt;a href=\"Heavy%20Armor%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Heavy Armor&lt;/a&gt; makes &lt;a href=\"Sneak%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;sneaking&lt;/a&gt; more difficult. Placing &lt;a href=\"Magic%20Rune\"&gt;runes&lt;/a&gt; or casting &lt;a href=\"Fireball%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Fireball&lt;/a&gt; near the spawn points of the draugr causes them to emerge prematurely, allowing them to be picked off one by one, before the fragment is grabbed. &lt;a href=\"Detect%20Dead\"&gt;Detect Dead&lt;/a&gt; can be of use here.\nOnce the fragment is obtained and the enemies killed, going up the stairs and through the empty coffin returns the Dragonborn to Dustman's Cairn, where a quick path to the exit can now be found.\nReturn and reward.\nUpon returning to &lt;a href=\"Jorrvaskr\"&gt;Jorrvaskr&lt;/a&gt;, Vilkas meets the Dragonborn and asks to be followed. Upon following him to the courtyard, Farkas vouches for the Dragonborn's competence during the mission, and the Dragonborn is formally inducted into the Companions."}

Too many times, I have had to treat a student with horrific burns or frostbite, or helped clean up the aftermath of a spell misfired in a location inappropriate for training, such as personal quarters.\nYou must take care when casting new spells, and there is no excuse for reckless behavior or slack adherence to the rules. These simple guidelines will protect you from your most dangerous enemy: carelessness.\n1. Never practice spells with elemental output indoors. No exceptions!\n2. When training with a staff, find a large, open space and check the weapon for impurities and damage before every use.\n3. Closing your eyes while casting will not make your spell more potent - trust me!\n4. Never attempt to use an untested &lt;a href=\"Destruction%20Staff%20%28Online%29\"&gt;destruction&lt;/a&gt; spell as a prank on another student (or any other spell, to be honest, try to be professional).\nRemember: even the masters - especially the masters - know to take the proper precautions at all times. Magical destruction is exciting and alluring, but any wizard with lazy, sloppy habits and irresponsible behavior won't survive to explore it!"}

However, the Psijic mages were said to have their own interpretation of the Endeavor which they recorded in the \"Scroll of Adompha\". How exactly the Endeavor is achieved is not fully known, but it has been said that there is a shared \"Old Way\" which is taught by the Psijics, and a \"New Way.\"\nBackground.\nThe Psijic Endeavor was the original basis of the teachings of the Prophet, &lt;a href=\"Veloth\"&gt;Veloth&lt;/a&gt;, whose \"anti-laws\" were inspired by the teachings of &lt;a href=\"Mephala\"&gt;Mephala&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Boethiah\"&gt;Boethiah&lt;/a&gt;, who wished to show their followers the lies &lt;a href=\"Trinimac\"&gt;Trinimac&lt;/a&gt; had attributed to &lt;a href=\"Lorkhan\"&gt;Lorkhan&lt;/a&gt;. Some sources claim that the teachings of the Daedra are not explicitly about the Endeavor, but that they merely form the antecedents of it.\nIt is described as being a process of reaching glorious apotheosis where \"time itself is bent inward and outward into a shape that is always new\" allowing its users to acquire states of existence that reach beyond the abilities of even the &lt;a href=\"Et%27Ada\"&gt;gods&lt;/a&gt;. This state, which resides at the end of the Endeavor, is known as &lt;a href=\"CHIM\"&gt;CHIM&lt;/a&gt;. The immortal wizard, &lt;a href=\"Divayth%20Fyr\"&gt;Divayth Fyr&lt;/a&gt;, had reason to believe that the Psijic Endeavor, or some similar process, may have played a role in the disappearance of the &lt;a href=\"Dwemer\"&gt;Dwemer&lt;/a&gt; due to their utilization of Lorkhan's Heart.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Dunmer\"&gt;Dunmer&lt;/a&gt; associate &lt;a href=\"Lorkhan\"&gt;Lorkhan&lt;/a&gt; with the Endeavor, believing that it was he who originally conceived the idea that the spirit realm was a prison, that being the reason he created the mortal realm, to be a new testing ground for transcendence. According to Vivec, Lorkhan was the first being to ever learn of, and utilize, the said process. Lorkhan first began his Endeavor by traveling to the end of the &lt;a href=\"Aurbis\"&gt;Aurbis&lt;/a&gt;, and then looking back upon it sideways, creating the infinite and godly image known as the Tower. After viewing the Tower, Lorkhan was inspired to create &lt;a href=\"Mundus\"&gt;Mundus&lt;/a&gt;, a reflection of its own creators, so that others could learn of the Psijic Endeavor, and how not to fail it. &lt;a href=\"Vivec\"&gt;Vivec&lt;/a&gt;'s teachings seem to imply that the Psijic Endeavor can be achieved through &lt;a href=\"Heart%20of%20Lorkhan\"&gt;Lorkhan's Heart&lt;/a&gt;, as it holds a \"secret Tower,\" which can only be seen by looking at the Heart sideways."}

From it, the &lt;a href=\"Mages%20Guild\"&gt;Mages Guild&lt;/a&gt; would later begin and develop in &lt;a href=\"2E%20230\"&gt;2E 230&lt;/a&gt;, started by &lt;a href=\"Vanus%20Galerion\"&gt;Vanus Galerion&lt;/a&gt;. The Psijic Order originated in the &lt;a href=\"Summerset%20Isles\"&gt;Summerset Isles&lt;/a&gt;, and their headquarters is located on Artaeum.\nThey were said to have been indirectly responsible for the development of &lt;a href=\"Mysticism\"&gt;Mysticism&lt;/a&gt;, long before there was a name for it. Their counsel has been sought by some political leaders, but other leaders have treated the Order with suspicion.\nHistory.\nFoundation and origins of the Order.\nWhen the &lt;a href=\"Altmer\"&gt;Altmer&lt;/a&gt; began to settle more permanently on the Summerset Isles from their ancient home of &lt;a href=\"Aldmeris\"&gt;Aldmeris&lt;/a&gt;, their culture began to change. They no longer worshipped the ancestor spirits, but several of those spirits such as &lt;a href=\"Auri-El\"&gt;Auri-El&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Trinimac\"&gt;Trinimac&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Syrabane\"&gt;Syrabane&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Phynaster\"&gt;Phynaster&lt;/a&gt; became gods that the Altmer worshipped instead. Many elders, who called themselves the Psijics, rebelled against this trend, as they were the keepers of the &lt;a href=\"Old%20Ways\"&gt;Old Ways&lt;/a&gt;. They used their mystical powers to settle in Artaeum, away from the \"corruption of their society.\" They frequently returned to the Summerset Isles to offer advice and guidance, however.\nFirst Era.\nThe earliest known recorded instance of the Psijic Order was in &lt;a href=\"1E%2020\"&gt;1E 20&lt;/a&gt;, when the renowned &lt;a href=\"Breton\"&gt;Breton&lt;/a&gt; sage &lt;a href=\"Voernet\"&gt;Voernet&lt;/a&gt; met with &lt;a href=\"Iachesis\"&gt;Iachesis&lt;/a&gt;. Around the end of the &lt;a href=\"First%20Era\"&gt;First Era&lt;/a&gt;, around the time of the founding of the &lt;a href=\"Mages%20Guild\"&gt;Mages Guild&lt;/a&gt;, Artaeum mysteriously disappeared, only to reappear exactly 500 years later, during the &lt;a href=\"Interregnum\"&gt;Interregnum&lt;/a&gt;. Most of the people who lived on Artaeum, including the members of the Psijic Order who were thought to have died when Artaeum vanished, also reappeared as well. The members of the Order refused to reveal where Artaeum had been during its time away.\nSecond Era.\n&lt;a href=\"Oriandra\"&gt;Oriandra&lt;/a&gt;, a member of the Order during the &lt;a href=\"Second%20Era\"&gt;Second Era&lt;/a&gt;, states that the Psijic Order sent Artaeum away from Tamriel to \"better promote meditative study and contemplation.\" &lt;a href=\"Tendinwe\"&gt;Tendinwe&lt;/a&gt;, another member, notes that the Order is even capable of making the island \"intangible.\"\nThird Era.\nIn &lt;a href=\"3E%20110\"&gt;3E 110&lt;/a&gt;, the Psijic Order is rumored to have created a storm that destroyed a fleet of Pyandoneans.\nFourth Era.\nMany years prior to &lt;a href=\"4E%20201\"&gt;4E 201&lt;/a&gt;, when the Arch-Mage &lt;a href=\"Savos%20Aren\"&gt;Savos Aren&lt;/a&gt; was merely an apprentice at the College of Winterhold, the Psijic Order was recalled to the Isle of Arteum, before disappearing around 4E 100. Before this recall, a member of the Psijic Order had advised the Arch-Mage at the College. An unspecified amount later, the Psijic Order would clash with the &lt;a href=\"Third%20Aldmeri%20Dominion\"&gt;Third Aldmeri Dominion&lt;/a&gt;. According to the Thalmor's representative, Ancano, at the &lt;a href=\"College%20of%20Winterhold\"&gt;College of Winterhold&lt;/a&gt;, this was because the Psijics considered themselves to be above the law of the Dominion. In contrast, the Psijics themselves state that the Thalmor see them as a threat because the Psijics have power and refuse to be controlled.\nAfter defeating &lt;a href=\"Ancano%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Ancano&lt;/a&gt;, the Dragonborn becomes &lt;a href=\"Arch-Mage\"&gt;Arch-Mage&lt;/a&gt; of the college, replacing the deceased &lt;a href=\"Savos%20Aren\"&gt;Savos Aren&lt;/a&gt;. The Psijic Order removes the &lt;a href=\"Eye%20of%20Magnus\"&gt;Eye of Magnus&lt;/a&gt; from the &lt;a href=\"Hall%20of%20the%20Elements\"&gt;Hall of the Elements&lt;/a&gt;, promising to safeguard the Eye from those who may abuse its power. &lt;a href=\"Quaranir\"&gt;Quaranir&lt;/a&gt; subsequently reveals that the installation of the Dragonborn as Arch-Mage had been the Order's intent from the start.\nOrganization.\nPhilosophy, beliefs and practices.\nThe Psijic Order is a powerful group that possesses immense amounts of knowledge and power. The Psijic Order was notable for indirect development of &lt;a href=\"Mysticism\"&gt;Mysticism&lt;/a&gt; long before there was a name for it. For the Psijic Order, the Old Ways, or the Elder Way, was the name for their practice; however, the term becomes mixed in \"semantic quagmire\" because the Old Ways was also referred to the Psijic Orders' religion, philosophy and beliefs, which may or may not be related to Mysticism. The Old Way, or the Elder Way, was a philosophy of meditation and study that could bind the forces of nature to an individual's will. It differed from magicka in terms of their origins, but the effects were the same.\nThe Psijic Order was notable for developing the Cloven Duality. The Order also developed the Psijic Compensation, which was an attempt to explain the basics of Aldmeri religion to Emperor Uriel V. There were two rites the Psijic Order was known to practice. One was &lt;a href=\"Vigyld\"&gt;Vigyld&lt;/a&gt;, which took place on the 1st of Second Seed. The other was called &lt;a href=\"Moawita\"&gt;Moawita&lt;/a&gt;, and was held on the 2nd of Hearth Fire.\nThe Psijic Order outlawed the use and practice of &lt;a href=\"necromancy\"&gt;necromancy&lt;/a&gt; by its members. While they believed necromancy to be dangerous, they also considered its use to be heretical due to their belief in the traditional ancestor spirits of the Altmer. It was rumored that members of the Psijic Order possessed an ability known as \"The Calling.\" This was thought to be a magical telepathic ability used to communicate silently.\nThe Psijics are also known for the study and practice of summonable magic constructs called \"&lt;a href=\"Exemplar\"&gt;Exemplar&lt;/a&gt;s.\" These theoretically represent the ideal forms that such creatures can assume, at which point they transcend the physical and incarnate the mystical. Inspired by the natural world, Psijic Monks travel all over &lt;a href=\"Tamriel\"&gt;Tamriel&lt;/a&gt;, taking models of animals from those regions to later perfect in their studies.\nInductions into the Psijic Order.\nThe Psijic Order chooses its members through a complex and ritualized method not well understood by outsiders. The \"&lt;a href=\"Pocket%20Guide%20to%20the%20Empire%2C%20Third%20Edition\"&gt;Pocket Guide to the Empire, Third Edition&lt;/a&gt;\" notes how in roughly 1,000 years, up to the year &lt;a href=\"3E%20430\"&gt;3E 430&lt;/a&gt;, only seventeen new members were added to the order. This fits with the history of the order, which is heavily steeped in tradition. However, from &lt;a href=\"3E%20430\"&gt;3E 430&lt;/a&gt; until the time of publication, two years later, in &lt;a href=\"3E%20432\"&gt;3E 432&lt;/a&gt;, they suddenly accepted over thirty new members.\nNotable members.\nThere are very few known members of the Psijic Order since its foundation:"}

After he suggests that the Dragonborn should speak with the &lt;a href=\"Augur%20of%20Dunlain\"&gt;Augur of Dunlain&lt;/a&gt;, he ends the spell and takes his leave, feigning ignorance when Ancano demands answers from him.\n&lt;a href=\"Revealing%20the%20Unseen%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Revealing the Unseen&lt;/a&gt;.\nAfter the Dragonborn has spoken to the &lt;a href=\"Synod%20Researcher\"&gt;Synod Researcher&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Paratus%20Decimius\"&gt;Paratus Decimius&lt;/a&gt; in the Oculary of the &lt;a href=\"Dwemer%20Ruins\"&gt;Dwemer Ruins&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"Mzulft%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Mzulft&lt;/a&gt;, Nerien appears to them again to warn them to return to the College of Winterhold at once, reminding them of a great challenge that is looming ahead of them before vanishing again.\n&lt;a href=\"The%20Eye%20of%20Magnus\"&gt;The Eye of Magnus&lt;/a&gt;.\nAfter the Dragonborn has slain Ancano and secured the Eye of Magnus, Quaranir appears to them to congratulate them on their accomplishment. He announces that the Eye has become unstable and the Psijic Order will take it and secure it elsewhere, so its power cannot be used again. Joined by fellow Psijic Monks &lt;a href=\"Gelebros\"&gt;Gelebros&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Tandil\"&gt;Tandil&lt;/a&gt;, Quaranir casts a spell that transports the Eye of Magnus out of the &lt;a href=\"Hall%20of%20the%20Elements\"&gt;Hall of the Elements&lt;/a&gt; as all three Psijic Monks vanish with it. Before he performs the spell, Quaranir names the Dragonborn the new Arch-Mage of the College of Winterhold to succeed the late Savos Aren, and &lt;a href=\"Tolfdir%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Tolfdir&lt;/a&gt; takes over as Master Wizard in the place of &lt;a href=\"Mirabelle%20Ervine\"&gt;Mirabelle Ervine&lt;/a&gt;."}

She was forced to kill her own son to save her village. To honor his memory and to provide a rallying point for the order, Adeliza wove the banner that would forever represent us with thread and wool and tears. She also added a few drops of her own blood to show her commitment to the cause. Every commander of the order since has added a drop of his or her blood to the banner to carry on the tradition.\nIn time, Adeliza grew the order into a powerful force. She led the order to &lt;a href=\"Wrothgar%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Wrothgar&lt;/a&gt;, where she found the base of operations that we call home to this day. The &lt;a href=\"Argent%20Mine\"&gt;Argent Mine&lt;/a&gt;, once a rich silver mine that made Adeliza's family wealthy beyond compare, was turned into the secret base of the Order of the Silver Dawn. We still mine silver from its depths to craft our weapons and armor, and our sacred banner has a place of honor in the &lt;a href=\"Argent%20Mine%23Purifier%27s%20Hall\"&gt;Purifier's Hall&lt;/a&gt;.\nMy team as commander of the order, which began a scant six years ago, has been plagued by one particular werewolf and his feral followers. &lt;a href=\"Magnar%20Child-Eater\"&gt;Magnar Child-Eater&lt;/a&gt; has gathered a pack of werewolves to his side. Together, they rampage throughout Wrothgar and High Rock, causing mayhem, raiding and marauding, and seeking new converts to their terrible, bestial tribe.\nMagnar Child-Eater, in particular, deserves a prison in the foulest corner of dread &lt;a href=\"Oblivion%20%28Realm%29\"&gt;Oblivion&lt;/a&gt;. His name isn't simply to scare the common folk. He actually had a taste for the tender flesh of children, and he often rewards his pack hunters for acquiring such delicacies for him to feast upon. I am not exaggerating by saying that the Silver Dawn is at war with the Magnar Pack. Causalities have mounted on both sides, but I have hopes that our scouts are close to discovering the pack's lair. Then we can launch a final assault and destroy Magnar and his feral offspring once and for all."}

With no questions asked, he will then act as a follower all the way to the Silver Hand hideout at Driftshade Refuge, a small fort southeast of Dawnstar. Note that he will replace any existing &lt;a href=\"Followers%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;follower&lt;/a&gt;, and it is not possible to share things with him, so he cannot be used to help carry things if the Dragonborn is &lt;a href=\"Encumbrance%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;overencumbered&lt;/a&gt;. Upon arrival at the refuge, the Dragonborn must dispose of the three Silver Hand members guarding the exterior, then head inside. Vilkas will be wearing the helmet of his &lt;a href=\"Wolf%20Armor%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Wolf Armor&lt;/a&gt; for the duration of the quest.\nDen of the Silver Hand.\nDriftshade Refuge contains multiple hostile Silver Hand members, so the Dragonborn can take advantage of Vilkas as a follower and kill the opposition one by one.\nIn the first room down the stairs, aside from Silver Hand members, there is an end table and regular table with &lt;a href=\"Random%20Loot%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;loot&lt;/a&gt; on and within them. The door straight ahead (north) is barred. To the west is a room with several bookshelves, numerous &lt;a href=\"Books%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;books&lt;/a&gt; (most &lt;a href=\"Ruined%20Book\"&gt;ruined&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"Burned%20Book\"&gt;burned&lt;/a&gt;), and another table with random loot. To the north is another room with bookshelves and a table, and a passage leading west to a wooden door.\nThrough the door is a two-leveled room with many boxes on the floor. Among the many books on bookshelves, there is \"&lt;a href=\"An%20Explorer%27s%20Guide%20to%20Skyrim\"&gt;An Explorer's Guide to Skyrim&lt;/a&gt;\", which will add a few map markers for later exploration. It is located on the upper level, on a bookshelf against the west wall beneath a mounted &lt;a href=\"Elk%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;elk&lt;/a&gt; head. To the west on the lower level is an &lt;a href=\"Lockpicking%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Adept-locked&lt;/a&gt; chest containing &lt;a href=\"Septim%20%28Coin%29\"&gt;gold&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Potions%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;potions&lt;/a&gt;. The tunnel north of the room leads to an Adept-locked door on the left. The Dragonborn has the option of unlocking it and defeating more of the Silver Hand, then looting the chest and taking the &lt;a href=\"Ingots%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;ingots&lt;/a&gt; from the table. In the next room, a set of spears block the entrance, but the corresponding lever is located right next to the spears. The Dragonborn should proceed forward and enter Driftshade Cellar.\nOn the left side behind some barrels is a chest with leveled loot. One must follow the path and make use of the spike wall &lt;a href=\"Traps%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;trap&lt;/a&gt; to dispose of enemies. Facing the spike wall, one can activate it using the pull bar on the right and enter the area behind it for another treasure chest. A pullbar on the wall can be used to get back out. Travel east to a door to another room with two enemies and, hidden on a shelf, the &lt;a href=\"Light%20Armor%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Light Armor&lt;/a&gt; skill book \"&lt;a href=\"The%20Rear%20Guard\"&gt;The Rear Guard&lt;/a&gt;\" can be found. The cellar will turn into a snowy cave, and the next room is in two levels, with a Silver Hand &lt;a href=\"Archery%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;archer&lt;/a&gt; on the above ledge. The Dragonborn should kill them and examine the cages. One of them holds a living &lt;a href=\"Werewolf%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;werewolf&lt;/a&gt;, who will become hostile and attack if the cage is unlocked; the other one contains a dead &lt;a href=\"Horse%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;horse&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe Fragments of Wuuthrad.\nAfter passing through a torture chamber, the next large chamber contains only a couple of enemies. A &lt;a href=\"coin%20purse\"&gt;coin purse&lt;/a&gt;, two potions, and an &lt;a href=\"apothecary%27s%20satchel\"&gt;apothecary's satchel&lt;/a&gt; filled with a few &lt;a href=\"Ingredients%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;ingredients&lt;/a&gt; can be found on a bookshelf behind the fireplace. The satchel is located on the top shelf of the bookcase, and can be easy to miss, as this is a darker corner of the room.\nTaking the only available path, one will be lead back to an initially inaccessible part of Driftshade Refuge (behind the barred door in the first room). The first chamber contains the three remaining members of the Silver Hand, the &lt;a href=\"One-Handed%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;One-Handed&lt;/a&gt; skill book \"&lt;a href=\"2920%2C%20Morning%20Star%2C%20v1\"&gt;2920, Morning Star, v1&lt;/a&gt;\", the &lt;a href=\"Block%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Block&lt;/a&gt; skill book \"&lt;a href=\"Warrior%20%28Book%29\"&gt;Warrior&lt;/a&gt;\", a treasure chest with considerable loot, and the stolen Fragments of Wuuthrad. Using the door to the south allows for an easy escape route to return to &lt;a href=\"Jorrvaskr\"&gt;Jorrvaskr&lt;/a&gt;. As soon as the Dragonborn arrives, Vilkas will be quick to inform them that the rest of the Companions should meet up at the &lt;a href=\"Skyforge%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Skyforge&lt;/a&gt; and pay their respects to the deceased, but now avenged, &lt;a href=\"Kodlak%20Whitemane\"&gt;Whitemane&lt;/a&gt;. This will complete the quest and trigger the start of next quest, \"&lt;a href=\"Glory%20of%20the%20Dead\"&gt;Glory of the Dead&lt;/a&gt;.\""}

She was young, rather dirty, wearing ragged black clothes that were surely quite smart and expensive weeks ago when she had stolen them from one of the city's best tailors. The look of surprise slipped from her face, and she took on a blank expression as she put the &lt;a href=\"Septim%20%28Coin%29\"&gt;gold&lt;/a&gt; back on the table.\n\"What are you doing here?\" the man with the candle asked, stepping from the shadows.\n\"That's a stupid question,\" the girl replied, frowning. \"I'm obviously robbing you.\"\n\"Since nothing I have is missing,\" the man smiled, glancing at the gold on the table. \"I would have to say that you're not robbing me. Attempting to rob me perhaps. The question I have is, why? You know who I am, I assume. You didn't just come in through an unlocked door.\"\n\"I've stolen from everyone else. I've taken soul gems from the &lt;a href=\"Mages%20Guild\"&gt;Mages Guild&lt;/a&gt;, I've robbed the treasury of the most secure fortress, I cheated the Archbishop of &lt;a href=\"Julianos\"&gt;Julianos&lt;/a&gt; \u2026 I even pickpocketed the Emperor &lt;a href=\"Pelagius\"&gt;Pelagius&lt;/a&gt; at his coronation. I thought it was your turn.\"\n\"I'm flattered,\" the man nodded. \"Now that your ambition has been thwarted, what will you do? Flee? Perhaps retire?\"\n\"Teach me,\" the girl replied, a little grin finding its way unconsciously on her face. \"I picked all your locks, I slipped past all your wards \u2026 You designed them, you know how difficult that was for someone without training. I didn't come here for six gold pieces. I came here to prove myself. Make me your student.\"\nThe Master of Stealth looked at the little girl burglar. \"Your skill is not in need of training. Your planning is adequate, but I can help you with that. What is without hope is your ambition. You are past stealing for your livelihood, now you steal for the pleasure of it, for the challenge. That's a personality trait which is incurable, and will lead you to an early grave.\"\n\"Haven't you ever wanted to steal that which can't be stolen?\" the girl asked. \"Something that would make your name known forever?\"\nThe Master did not answer: he only frowned.\n\"Clearly I was fooled by your reputation,\" she shrugged, and opened a window. \"I thought you might want a willing accomplice on some great act of thievery which would go down in history. Like you said, my skill at planning is only adequate. I didn't have in mind an escape route, but this will have to do.\"\nThe burglar slipped down the sheer wall, dashed across the shadowy courtyard, and within a few minutes was back at her room in the run-down tavern. The Master was waiting for her there, in the dark.\n\"I didn't see you go past me,\" she gasped.\"\n\"You turned on the street when you heard the owl call,\" he replied. \"The most important tool in the thieves' repertoire is distraction, either planned or improvised. I suppose your lessons have begun.\"\n\"And what is the final test?\" the girl smiled.\"\nWhen he told her, she could only stare. She had, it seemed, not misunderstood his reputation for daring. Not at all.\nChapter Two\"\"\nFor the week leading up to the Eighth of Hearthfire, the skies above &lt;a href=\"Rindale\"&gt;Rindale&lt;/a&gt; were dark and alive as clouds of crows blotted out the sun. Their guttural squawks and groans deafened all. The peasants wisely bolted their doors and windows, praying to survival that most unholy of days.\nOn the night of the summoning, the birds fell silent, their black unblinking eyes following the witches' march into the glen. There were no moons to light the way, only the leader's single torch in the gloom. Their white robes appeared as indistinct shapes, like the faintest of ghosts.\nA single tall tree stood in the middle of the clearing, every branch thick with crows, watching the procession without moving. The lead witch placed the torch at the base of the tree, and her seventeen followers formed a circle and began their slow, strange, wailing chant.\nAs they sang, the glow of the torch began to change. It did not diminish at all, but its color became more and more grey, so it seemed a pulsating wave of ash had fallen on the witches. Then it grew darker still, so that for a moment, though the fire yet burned, it was darkest night in the forest. The penumbra continued until the torch was burning with a color without a name, emptiness beyond mere blackness. It cast a glow, but it was an unnatural scintillation falling on the witches. Their robes of white became black. The &lt;a href=\"Dunmer\"&gt;Dunmer&lt;/a&gt; among them had eyes of green, and ivory white flesh. The &lt;a href=\"Nords\"&gt;Nords&lt;/a&gt; appeared black as coal. The crows watching overhead were as pure white as the witches' cloaks.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Daedra%20Princess\"&gt;Daedra Princess&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Nocturnal\"&gt;Nocturnal&lt;/a&gt; stepped out of the pit of uncolor.\nShe stood in the center of the circle, the tree of pallid crows her throne, aloof, as the witches continued their chanting, dropping their robes to prostrate themselves naked before their great mistress. Wrapping her night cloak around her, she smiled at their song. It spoke of her mystery, of veiled beauty, of eternal shadows and a divine future when the sun burns no more.\nNocturnal let her cloak slide from her shoulders and was naked. Her witches did not raise their head from the ground, but continued their hymn of darkness.\n\"Now,\" said the girl to herself.\nShe had been up in the tree all day, dressed in a ridiculous suit of mock crows. It was uncomfortable, but when the witches had arrived, she forgot all her aches, and concentrated on being perfectly still, like the other crows in the tree. It had taken considerable planning and study between her and the Master of Stealth to find the glen, and to learn what to expect in the summoning of Nocturnal.\nGently, silently, the burglar eased herself down the branches of the tree, coming closer and closer to the Daedra Princess. She let herself break her concentration for just a moment, and wondered where the Master was. He had been confident in the plan. He said that when Nocturnal dropped her cloak, there would be a distraction, and it could be quickly taken in that instant provided the girl was in position at the precise right moment.\nThe girl climbed along the lowest of the branches, carefully pushing aside the crows that were, as the Master said, transfixed by the Princess in her naked beauty. The girl was now close enough, if she only reached out her arm, to touch Nocturnal's back.\nThe song was rising to a crescendo, and the girl knew that the ceremony would soon be over. Nocturnal would clothe herself before the witches ended the chant, and the chance to take the cloak would be over. The girl gripped the tree branch tightly as her mind raced. Could it be that the Master was not here at all? Was this, was this conceivably the entire test? Was it only to show that it could be done, not to do it?\nThe girl was furious. She had done everything perfectly, but the so-called Master of Stealth had proven himself a coward. Perhaps he had taught her a little in the months that it took to plan this, but what was it worth? Only one thing made her smile. On that night when she had stolen into his stronghold, she had kept one single gold piece, and he had never suspected it. It was symbolic, as symbolic as stealing the cloak of Nocturnal in its way, proving that the Master Thief could be robbed.\nThe girl was so lost on her mind that she thought she imagined it for a moment when a man's voice yelled out from the darkness, \"Mistress!\"\nThe next words she knew she didn't imagine: \"Mistress! A thief! Behind you!\"\nThe witches raised their heads, and screamed, ruining the sanctity of the ceremony, as they charged forward. The crows awoke and burst from the tree in an explosion of feathers and toad-like cries. Nocturnal herself whirled around, affixing the girl with her black eyes.\n\"Who art thee who dares profane?\" The Princess hissed, as the pitch shadows flew from her body enveloping the girl in their lethal chill.\nIn the last instant before she was swallowed alive by darkness, the girl looked to the ground and saw that the cloak was gone, and she answered, as she understood, \"Oh, who am I? I'm the distraction.\""}

The Vestige now must distract the guard and search Canonreeve Malanie's house. In order to do that, the Vestige must take kindlepitch from the warehouse, get to the side of Canonreeve Malanie's home and light up a crate of linens. The guard will run to put out the fire, allowing the Vestige to enter the house unnoticed.\nIn Malanie's house, the Vestige finds a Veiled Heritance Officer attire which they take back to Razum-dar.

He will tell you that there are two portal chambers that will lead to the top of the Doomcrag, and will ask you to clear the way to the first one so that the troops may follow. \nHead south into the Doomcrag. As you follow the path, you will come across &lt;a href=\"Countess%20Eselde%20Tamrith\"&gt;Countess Eselde Tamrith&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Baron%20Alard%20Dorell\"&gt;Baron Alard Dorell&lt;/a&gt; having a discussion about whether to take a potentially unsafe shortcut. Just before you reach them however, you may spot a skyshard to your right, so make sure to take that with you. North of the skyshard is a copy of the lorebook \"&lt;a href=\"The%20Horse-Folk%20of%20Silverhoof\"&gt;The Horse-Folk of Silverhoof&lt;/a&gt;\", so be sure to pick that up as well. Either way, make your choice between Countess Tamrith's shortcut and the main path. If you pick the main path, . If you pick the shortcut through Varlasel, you will run into &lt;a href=\"Skordo%20the%20Knife\"&gt;Skordo the Knife&lt;/a&gt; there. He will help you fend off the enemies here, including the powerful &lt;a href=\"Skeletal%20Guardian\"&gt;Skeletal Guardian&lt;/a&gt; that awaits in the next room. After defeating the guardian, Skordo will stay behind to guard your rear. \nContinue through the ruins and you will find yourself in a chamber with a tile switch and a number of floor tiles with markings on them. The road ahead will be blocked by a barrier. Countess Tamrith will come up behind you once you enter this chamber. The moment you press the button, you will see ayleid spirits walking up to and activating some of the tiles; these are the tiles you must press to proceed. You need to press the tiles with the signs of The Ritual, The Warrior, The Mage, The Tower and The Shadow, in that order. This will dispel the barrier and allow you to proceed forward. \nOnce you are back outside, the portal chamber will be to your north, down the stairs. Head in and press the button, and a portal to the base camp will appear. Count Verandis will appear from the portal along with some soldiers; speak with him and he will tell you to head to the second portal chamber, which should be on the third level of the ruins. Head outside and proceed westward, into the Chamber of the Stone Guardian. There is another riddle here; the four statues in this room bear descriptions referring to each of the four seasons. &lt;a href=\"Larelleis\"&gt;Larelleis&lt;/a&gt; refers to spring, &lt;a href=\"Wenayasille\"&gt;Wenayasille&lt;/a&gt; refers to summer, &lt;a href=\"Morilatta\"&gt;Morilatta&lt;/a&gt; refers to autumn and &lt;a href=\"Angalayond\"&gt;Angalayond&lt;/a&gt; refers to winter. You do not have to interpret these for yourself; Verandis will also be here, and will tell you which season is being referred to after reading the inscription. After you have examined these, speak with the &lt;a href=\"Stone%20Guardian\"&gt;Stone Guardian&lt;/a&gt; by the door. She will present you with a series of riddles, to which you must answer the name of one of the statues. \nThe first riddle goes as follows:\n\"Tell me, what is the time of dawning? Of birth and nourishing rain?\"\nTo this first riddle, the answer is Larelleis, spring. The second riddle is as follows:\n\"A time of light and joy and abundant growth. Long, hot days give way to short, hot nights.\"\nThe answer here is Wenayasille, summer. The third riddle goes like this:\n\"An end comes to all things. And like dusk comes before the night, this cycle comes before the gray of iron death.\"\nThe answer to this is Morilatta, autumn. Finally, the last riddle goes like this:\n\"Tell me true, if you really wish to pass. What is the season of iron gray? What is the cycle in which the world finally dies, at least for a time?\"\nThe answer here is Angalayond, winter. After answering these riddles, the door ahead will open.\nHead through the door and proceed along the path. You will find the portal switch in the final room. Baron Dorell will appear from the portal once you press the button; speak with him and he will tell you that the battle below is going well, and that you should speak with Count Ravenwatch about how to proceed. Before you speak with Verandis, be sure to pick up the copy of the lorebook \"&lt;a href=\"Darkest%20Darkness\"&gt;Darkest Darkness&lt;/a&gt;\" from among the boxes to his left.\nSpeaking with Verandis will finish this quest and start the next one, \"&lt;a href=\"The%20Lightless%20Remnant\"&gt;The Lightless Remnant&lt;/a&gt;.\""}

The island chain is covered mostly in dense rainforest and has been described as \"a playground for the southern water spirits.\"\nGeography.\nIn the year\u00a0&lt;a href=\"2E%20486\"&gt;2E 486&lt;/a&gt;, a small Maormeri fleet was sighted off the coast of\u00a0&lt;a href=\"Alinor\"&gt;Alinor&lt;/a&gt;, and King\u00a0&lt;a href=\"Hidellith\"&gt;Hidellith&lt;/a&gt;\u00a0ordered\u00a0his navy to give chase. The navy followed the ships through uncharted waters, into an ambush in Pyandonea itself. Most of the Alinor navy was destroyed, but a single warship returned to Summerset to describe the land as a \"sea jungle.\" Massive plateaus spilling over with vegetation forming mazes around valleys of ocean. Waving tendrils of kelp trap all but the Maormer's own ships, and provide a well-camouflaged home for the &lt;a href=\"sea%20serpent\"&gt;sea serpent&lt;/a&gt;s that are &lt;a href=\"Orgnum\"&gt;Orgnum&lt;/a&gt;'s guards and occasional mounts. Mist storms spill over the land, further disorienting one's views. That even one ship survived is a testament to the maritime genius of the\u00a0&lt;a href=\"Altmer\"&gt;Altmer&lt;/a&gt;.\nHistory and politics.\nIt was once believed that the Maormer of Pyandonea were originally exiled from the Summerset Isle. However, translations of tapestries in the\u00a0&lt;a href=\"Crystal%20Tower\"&gt;Crystal Tower&lt;/a&gt;\u00a0tell the tale of how the Maormer were likely separated in their original homeland of\u00a0&lt;a href=\"Aldmeris\"&gt;Aldmeris&lt;/a&gt;. According to the legend, Orgnum was a phenomenally wealthy\u00a0&lt;a href=\"Aldmer\"&gt;Aldmer&lt;/a&gt;\u00a0nobleman, who used his finances to launch a rebellion against the powers of the land. He and his followers were banished for this to a place separated from Aldmeris by an impenetrable mist, Pyandonea, \"The &lt;a href=\"Veil%20of%20Mist\"&gt;Veil of Mist&lt;/a&gt;.\" This boundary proved so effective that the followers of Orgnum never again disturbed their former countrymen in Aldmeris.\nThe Maormer were relentless in their drive to conquer Summerset, and there is scarcely a year throughout the\u00a0&lt;a href=\"First%20Era\"&gt;First&lt;/a&gt;\u00a0or\u00a0&lt;a href=\"Second%20Era\"&gt;Second&lt;/a&gt; Eras\u00a0when they did not ravage the coastlines of the\u00a0&lt;a href=\"Altmer\"&gt;Altmer&lt;/a&gt;.\u00a0Every attack launched by the Maormer against Summerset has been led by Orgnum himself,\u00a0and\u00a0despite the number of wars and strategies employed by the Maormer, each of these attacks has proved to be an ultimate failure.\nThe\u00a0&lt;a href=\"Second%20Aldmeri%20Dominion\"&gt;Second Aldmeri Dominion&lt;/a&gt;\u00a0made allies of the Maormer,\u00a0although the Dominion allowed the kings of\u00a0&lt;a href=\"Colovia\"&gt;Colovia&lt;/a&gt;\u00a0to eliminate Maormer outposts that had been established along the western coast of the mainland.\nThe last documented appearance of the Maormer was in\u00a0&lt;a href=\"3E%20110\"&gt;3E 110&lt;/a&gt;\u00a0in the\u00a0&lt;a href=\"War%20of%20the%20Isle\"&gt;War of the Isle&lt;/a&gt;. The united alliance of the kings of &lt;a href=\"Isle%20of%20Summerset\"&gt;Summerset&lt;/a&gt; and\u00a0&lt;a href=\"Antiochus%20Septim\"&gt;Antiochus&lt;/a&gt;,\u00a0combining the &lt;a href=\"Imperial%20Navy\"&gt;Imperial fleet&lt;/a&gt; and the royal navies of Summerset Isle, together with the magical powers of the\u00a0&lt;a href=\"Psijic%20Order\"&gt;Psijic Order&lt;/a&gt;, succeeded in destroying the Pyandonean invading armada.\u00a0It was said that the storm brewed by the\u00a0Psijic\u00a0of\u00a0&lt;a href=\"Artaeum\"&gt;Artaeum&lt;/a&gt;\u00a0so\u00a0annihilated Orgnum's fleet that he was never again able to muster together enough of a force to dare another battle."}

She had to face chef &lt;a href=\"Fexxel\"&gt;Fexxel&lt;/a&gt;, who refused to let Anna\u00efg go without fighting. Qijne wounded Fexxel with her invisible blade.

Slyr and Anna\u00efg did not please Lord Ghol at first, so Anna\u00efg decided to cook on her own to learn about the ingredients in Umbriel. Qijne discovered her cooking when she was supposed to be cataloging. Anna\u00efg explained that she did not want to disappoint Lord Ghol again, but Qijne told her that she would kill Slyr and cut off one of her feet if they failed again.\nQijne inquired Slyr why they were serving a complete fish to Lord Ghol. Anna\u00efg explained to her who the fish would release a series of odors. &lt;a href=\"Void%20Salts%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;Void&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Fire%20Salts%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;fire salts&lt;/a&gt; there around the fish, which would then release their essences. After a tense silence, Qijne simply walked off.\nAfter Anna\u00efg's success, &lt;a href=\"Toel\"&gt;Toel&lt;/a&gt; decided to invade Qijne's kitchen. Qijne gathered her strongest cooks and they escorted Slyr and Anna\u00efg to a safe room. A bull sized beast destroyed the door of their refuge, and Toel's cooks poured through the door. Qijne lost an ear and her arm was wounded. She knew that they had lost, but she wound not let Toel have his trophy. She approached Anna\u00efg and tried to kill her with her invisible blade, but Slyr buried her cleaver in Qijne\u2019s neck. Qijne resisted for a moment, but she finally dies.\nPowers.\nShe had an ability to damage people with her bare hands. She could whip out her arm and the victim is either severely injured or murdered. Other chefs refer to it as a filet knife. Nobody knows how she can do it or how long it can get. Glim later found Qijne's body in the sump."}

According to Brynjolf, she has a job of utmost importance for me and I need to follow her directions to the letter.\"\nWalkthrough.\nThe first step in the quest is to speak with Maven Black-Briar. She will be waiting upstairs in &lt;a href=\"The%20Bee%20and%20Barb\"&gt;The Bee and Barb&lt;/a&gt;, wandering around town during daylight, or in the &lt;a href=\"Black-Briar%20Meadery\"&gt;Black-Briar Meadery&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Riften%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Riften&lt;/a&gt;. She asks the Dragonborn to shut down a competitor, the newly opened &lt;a href=\"Honningbrew%20Meadery\"&gt;Honningbrew Meadery&lt;/a&gt; located outside &lt;a href=\"Whiterun%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Whiterun&lt;/a&gt;, and to find out how its owner Sabjorn has managed so quickly to fund its opening.\n or\n\"One more time in case I wasn't clear. You butcher this job and you'll be sorry.\"\n\"Shouldn't you be on your way to Whiterun?\"\nNext, it is necessary to find and speak with Mallus Maccius. He will be waiting in &lt;a href=\"The%20Bannered%20Mare\"&gt;The Bannered Mare&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Whiterun%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Whiterun&lt;/a&gt;. He tells the Dragonborn to ask Sabjorn for work clearing out pests that Mallus has lured into the meadery. The Dragonborn is to fulfill this job, &lt;a href=\"Potions%20%28Skyrim%29%23Poisons\"&gt;poisoning&lt;/a&gt; the meadery vat in the process.\n\"Can't a man drink in peace?\"\n\"Remember, Sabjorn will be needing a helping hand. Make it look good.\"\nSabjorn will give the Dragonborn a key to the meadery's basement with instructions to kill all the pests and to poison their nest. This presents the opportunity to poison the vats as well.\n\"What are you gawking at? Can't you see I have problems here?\"\n\"Now I've got to clean up this mess.\"\nGetting to the nest is straightforward, but there are quite a few &lt;a href=\"Skeever%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;skeevers&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"venomfang%20skeever\"&gt;venomfang skeever&lt;/a&gt;s, and some &lt;a href=\"Frostbite%20Spider%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;frostbite spiders&lt;/a&gt; along the way. However, the real challenge is dealing with &lt;a href=\"Hamelyn\"&gt;Hamelyn&lt;/a&gt;; a mage living next to the nest. He uses a fairly powerful &lt;a href=\"Magicka%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;magic&lt;/a&gt; attack (which appears to be random, but may vary depending on the Dragonborn's level). If the Dragonborn is a &lt;a href=\"Werewolf%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;werewolf&lt;/a&gt;, transforming may be a good option: roaring will cause him to enter a state of &lt;a href=\"Fear%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Fear&lt;/a&gt;, offering an excellent chance to kill him. One can also paralyze him (via the &lt;a href=\"Ice%20Form\"&gt;Ice Form&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Dragon%20shout\"&gt;Dragon shout&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"Paralyze%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Paralyze&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Spells%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;spell&lt;/a&gt;, or paralysis-enchanted weapons) to prevent him from attacking, then retaliating or sneaking past. He can also be killed with a sneak attack from behind if one's Sneak and &lt;a href=\"One-Handed%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;One&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"Two-Handed%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Two-Handed&lt;/a&gt; skill is high enough. Another option is to use &lt;a href=\"Frenzy%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Frenzy&lt;/a&gt; on him and the skeevers, then repeatedly sneak attack after using Calm on him.\nAfter Hamelyn is dealt with, the nest can be poisoned, and then the Dragonborn can then enter the tunnel. The area to poison the nest is the pile of hay to the right of the alchemy lab. The area where poison can be used is fairly small. Going through the tunnel to the &lt;a href=\"Honningbrew%20Meadery%23Honningbrew%20Boilery\"&gt;Honningbrew Boilery&lt;/a&gt;, it is possible to go up the stairs and pour the poison into the vat. The door's &lt;a href=\"Keys%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;key&lt;/a&gt; hangs right next to it. Afterwards, Sabjorn needs to be told that the job is done.\n\"Was something we discussed unclear?\"\nNow it is time to attend the tasting ceremony. &lt;a href=\"Commander%20Caius\"&gt;Commander Caius&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"Sinmir\"&gt;Sinmir&lt;/a&gt; tastes the mead (Sinmir will only be present in place of Caius if the &lt;a href=\"Battle%20for%20Whiterun%20%28Stormcloaks%29\"&gt;Battle for Whiterun&lt;/a&gt; has been completed for the &lt;a href=\"Stormcloak\"&gt;Stormcloak&lt;/a&gt;s) and is unhappy with it. He puts Mallus in charge and drags Sabjorn off to &lt;a href=\"Dragonsreach%20Dungeon\"&gt;Dragonsreach Dungeon&lt;/a&gt; as punishment for trying to poison him.\nCommander Caius: \"Well, Sabjorn. Now that you've taken care of your little pest problem, how about I get a taste of some of your mead?\"\nSabjorn: \"Help yourself, milord. It's my finest brew yet... I call it Honningbrew Reserve. I think you'll find it quite pleasing to your palate.\"\nCommander Caius: \"Oh come now, this is mead... not some wine to be sipped and savored.\"\nCommander Caius: \"By the Eight?! What... what's in this?\"\nSabjorn: \"I... I don't know. What's wrong?\"\nCommander Caius: \"You assured me this place was clean! I'll see... see to it that you remain in irons for the rest of your days!\"\nSabjorn: \"No, please! I don't understand...\"\nCommander Caius: \"Silence, idiot! I should have known better... to trust this place after it's been riddled with filth.\"\nSabjorn: \"I beg you... please. This is not what it seems!\"\nCommander Caius: \"You... you're in charge here until I can sort this all out.\"\nMallus Maccius: \"It will be my pleasure.\"\nCommander Caius: \"And you... you're coming with me to Dragonsreach. We'll see how quickly your memory clears in the city's prisons. Now move.\"\nSabjorn: \"Look, I assure you, this is all just a huge misunderstanding!\"\nCommander Caius: \"I said move!\"\nMallus Maccius: \"Farewell, Sabjorn.\"\nAt this point, Mallus will help locate the books that identify Sabjorn's \"silent partner.\"\n\"I don't think that could have gone any better. Anything else you need before you head back to Riften?\"\n\"Remember to put in a good word with Maven for me.\"\nUpstairs, a &lt;a href=\"Promissory%20Note%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;promissory note&lt;/a&gt; is in Sabjorn's dresser. Behind the door to the right of the dresser is the &lt;a href=\"Honningbrew%20Decanter\"&gt;Honningbrew Decanter&lt;/a&gt; (a &lt;a href=\"The%20Litany%20of%20Larceny%23Larceny%20trophies\"&gt;larceny target&lt;/a&gt;), which can be sold to &lt;a href=\"Delvin%20Mallory%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Delvin Mallory&lt;/a&gt;.\nUpon returning to Riften, Maven Black-Briar can be given the note. She tells the Dragonborn to take the information to Brynjolf, who acknowledges the findings and sends the Dragonborn to &lt;a href=\"Mercer%20Frey\"&gt;Mercer Frey&lt;/a&gt; (who he feels will be able to identify the symbol on the note and shed some light on the &lt;a href=\"Thieves%20Guild%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Thieves Guild's&lt;/a&gt; anonymous adversary). The quest \"&lt;a href=\"Scoundrel%27s%20Folly\"&gt;Scoundrel's Folly&lt;/a&gt;\" then begins.\n\"I trust you have good news for me.\"\n\"Out of my way.\"\nRewards.\nUpon returning to Maven Black-Briar, the Dragonborn is given either a leveled &lt;a href=\"Enchanting%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;enchanted&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Daggers%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;dagger&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Swords%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;sword&lt;/a&gt;, or &lt;a href=\"Maces%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;mace&lt;/a&gt; and Mallus will become available as a &lt;a href=\"Fence%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;fence&lt;/a&gt;. Returning to the Honningbrew Meadery some time later reveals that the signs have been removed, and the meadery is now part of the &lt;a href=\"Black-Briar%20Meadery\"&gt;Black-Briar Meadery&lt;/a&gt;."}

She will ask you to help and detail two options for further interrogation. The cruel option involves enchanting a heart and putting it in a dead cultist to make it speak the truth. The less cruel option involves using an orb to collect a cultist's memories and then kill them, allowing the orb to be read and the cultists' plans discovered.\nIf you choose the cruel option, \nIf you choose the less cruel option, Dajaheel will give you the orb and instruct you to use it on the prisoners and then kill them. Hunt for cultists to the southwest, use the globe on them and then kill them. You need at least five of them, but this will not be hard as they are not exactly scarce. Once you have collected the memories of five cultists, head back to camp and give the globe to &lt;a href=\"Lieutenant%20Belron\"&gt;Lieutenant Belron&lt;/a&gt; so he can read the memories. A memory of the Reachman leader, &lt;a href=\"Stral%20Blackthroat\"&gt;Stral Blackthroat&lt;/a&gt;, should appear.

Hardly more than a track -- doesn't anyone else ever come down here?!\nThe trader's shop was closed, and she wouldn't come to the door even though I could see a light in the upstairs window -- RUDE!!! But at least this inn was open (although the proprietor is kind of creepy -- kept giving me these weird grins when he thought I wasn't looking -- ugh.) And what's wrong with his face??\nSeems like I'm the only one staying here tonight. I didn't see much of the town since it was already dark, but I admit to being kind of spooked -- but I'll never admit that to Mother! Or she'd never let me go on another one of these deliveries. She still thinks I'm just a baby (she would probably say \"hatchling,\" and in front of my friends too!) Remember to ask her about the creepy innkeeper when I get home.\nWell, the candle is almost burned down (they don't even provide a lantern in this horrible old inn!), so I guess I'd better try to get some sleep.

Strangely, Darien is also not poisoned by the mist unlike the Vestige who used the Midnight Talisman.\n&lt;a href=\"The%20Labyrinth\"&gt;The Labyrinth&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe final battle against Angof begins now. The Vestige needs to get inside and navigate the labyrinth of catacombs to find a safe place for &lt;a href=\"Gabrielle%20Benele\"&gt;Gabrielle&lt;/a&gt; and the soldiers to teleport into.\n&lt;a href=\"Angof%20the%20Gravesinger%20%28Quest%29\"&gt;Angof the Gravesinger&lt;/a&gt;.\nDarien was sent into a different part of the crypt than Gabrielle and the others. He discovered from a Bloodthorn Cultist that the Vestige need three shard-keys to open the three looks that protect Angof's inner sanctum.\nRivenspire.\n&lt;a href=\"The%20Road%20to%20Rivenspire\"&gt;The Road to Rivenspire&lt;/a&gt;.\nAfter the events of Stormhaven, the Vestige runs into Darien once again at Oldgate in Rivenspire, no longer a soldier but an adventurer and sellsword who currently works for Countess Tamrith. He updates you on the situation in Rivenspire and the civil war between the three noble houses.\n&lt;a href=\"Shornhelm%20Divided\"&gt;Shornhelm Divided&lt;/a&gt;.\nDarien directs you to find Count Tamrith in Shornhelm's chapel, who is holding off an assault from Baron Wylon Montclair.\n&lt;a href=\"The%20Parley\"&gt;The Parley&lt;/a&gt;.\nDarien eventually joined the Fighter's Guild and is hired along with a contingent by &lt;a href=\"Queen%20Arzhela\"&gt;Queen Arzhela&lt;/a&gt; to oversee her protection during the tense negotiations between the Kingdom of Evermore and the Imperial invaders for the fate of Bangkorai.\nColdharbour.\n&lt;a href=\"The%20Weight%20of%20Three%20Crowns\"&gt;The Weight of Three Crowns&lt;/a&gt;.\nDarien appears in a minor capacity during negotiations in &lt;a href=\"Stirk\"&gt;Stirk&lt;/a&gt;.\n&lt;a href=\"The%20Army%20of%20Meridia\"&gt;The Army of Meridia&lt;/a&gt;.\nDuring the assault on Coldharbour, he can be found in the Fighters Guildhall once &lt;a href=\"King%20Laloriaran%20Dynar\"&gt;King Laloriaran Dynar&lt;/a&gt; has been rescued from the &lt;a href=\"Lightless%20Oubliette\"&gt;Lightless Oubliette&lt;/a&gt;. He has assumed command, being the only noble-born there, however once spoken to, he will agree to give Dynar a chance.\n&lt;a href=\"The%20Final%20Assault\"&gt;The Final Assault&lt;/a&gt;.\nDarien, along with &lt;a href=\"Cadwell\"&gt;Cadwell&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Skordo%20the%20Knife\"&gt;Skordo the Knife&lt;/a&gt;, is one of the companions you can choose to accompany you into &lt;a href=\"The%20Endless%20Stair\"&gt;The Endless Stair&lt;/a&gt;.\nPersonality and traits.\nHe is shown to be very confident and capable at times, as well as flirtatious and lighthearted. For example, he is capable of seducing a Montclair Captain for information. Even when preparing to fight &lt;a href=\"Molag%20Bal%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Molag Bal&lt;/a&gt; in Coldharbour, he takes the time to fantasize about beautiful women.\nConversations.\nGwendis: \"My, my, Sir Darien. That was impressive. But when it comes to smuggler's tunnels, I think there's a thing or two I can teach you.\"\nDarien Gautier: \"I'm not sure how to respond to that. Why don't you find out what our vampire vixen is talking about.\"\nCount Verandis Ravenwatch: \"The power is dropping! Gwendis, are you all right?\"\nGwendis: \"I ... I did it. I resisted! I didn't feed. Wait, what happened to the nobles? Did ... did I remember wrong?\"\nCount Verandis Ravenwatch: \"They're fine. Merely unconscious. I'm proud of your restraint, Gwendis.\"\nDarien Gautier: \"What's going on in here? Is the Countess all right?\"\nSkordo the Knife: \"Damn it, Darien! Slow down! Wait for me, you long-legged bastard.\"\nCount Verandis Ravenwatch: \"The Baron and the Countess are fine. But you both arrived just in time to move them to safety.\"\nDarien Gautier: \"Take them out? But we just got here. We want to help take down Montclair! Neither of us had a good fight in ... well, it's been at least a couple minutes.\"\nCount Verandis Ravenwatch: \"No, Darien. This battle is not one that you and Skordo can win. Leave Montclair to us.\"\nDarien Gautier: \"But ... but ... oh, very well! But I get to help take down the next would-be world conquerer we come across. Deal?\"\nCount Verandis Ravenwatch: \"As you wish, brave Darien, as you wish. And now, my friend, the time has come to face Montclair.\"\nDarien Gautier: \"All right, everyone. Let's gather up our injured and get out of here.\"\nCountess Eselde Tamrith: \"Darien's right. There's nothing left for us here. We need to return to the High King and let him know what happened.\"\nBaron Alard Dorell: \"Mage, we need a portal. To Shornhelm, if you please.\"\nNorthpoint Defender: \"\"Of course, Baron. Only take a moment.\"\nAfter opening the portal:\nNorthpoint Defender: \"The portal to Shornhelm is open, my lord.\"\nDuring the meeting:\nQueen Arzhela: \"I don't like this. Where's the Magus-General? It's not like a Tharn to be late.\"\nSeptima Tharn: \"Impatience is hardly the mark of a strong ruler, Your Majesty.\"\nQueen Arzhela: \"When you're queen, you're welcome to set a finer example, Magus-General.\"\nSeptima Tharn: \"That's one honor I do not seek. What I do seek, is the unconditional surrender of Evermore.\"\nQueen Arzhela: \"You came all this way just to make absurd demands? I'm surprised.\"\nSeptima Tharn: \"Hardly absurd, Arzhela. I tried the soft approach with the duke, but you spoiled that effort. I've come to make one final offer: surrender, or you will die.\"\nQueen Arzhela: \"Your threats carry little weight, Septima. Bangkorai Garrison still stands between us, and it does not fall easily, or did you miss that in your history lessons?\"\nSeptima Tharn: \"Those who hide in the shadows of the past are crushed when its structure come tumbling down ... Bangkorai Garrison has already fallen. My legionaries walk its battlements even now.\"\nQueen Arzhela: \"Is this another of your lies? I don't care. It's clear you want a war. And if that's what you want, you can have it! What the ...? She's not even here! It's an illusion!\"\nSeptima Tharn: \"Ha! Just remember, you struck first, Arzhela. Seventh Legion\u2014Attack!\"\nDarien Gautier: \"Ambush! Defend the queen at all cost.\"\nBefore leaving the parley site:\nDarien Gautier: \"Can't you cast any faster, Gabrielle? The Imperials can. More portals opening up!\"\nGabrielle Bernele: \"The portal to Evermore ... go, Your Majesty, go!\"\nUpon return to the palace:\nDarien Gautier: \"That ... could've gone better ...\"\nGabrielle Bernele: \"I didn't think I had another portal in me ... glad I was wrong.\"\nQueen Arzhela: \"Well ... at least some of us survived.\"\nBefore talking to him:\nDarien Gautier: \"Your nagging is becoming more annoying than my persistent rash. We finally have a secure base\u2014to go back outside without a plan is even too foolhardy for me.\"\nValorone: \"You want us to hide behind these walls? To leave our comrades to die while you sip wine and lounge about? You have no honor, knight!\"\nDarien Gautier: \"Don't lecture me about honor, Elf! You have no idea what I've seen or what I've gone through!\"\nWhen King Dynar enters:\nLaloriaran Dynar: \"Attend me, soldiers! We have a war to win and time grows short.\"\nValorone: \"What in Auriel's name is this? Who are you?\"\nDarien Gautier: \"So that's the last Ayleid king, huh? I thought he'd be more... dusty. Isn't that what happens when Elves get really, really old?\"\nValorone: \"Shut it, you fop.\"\nLaloriaran Dynar: \"Who's in charge of this group? Step forward and address me.\"\nValorone and Darien: \"&lt;Look around room in confusion&gt;\"\nLaloriaran Dynar: \"Then allow me to rectify that. I shall lead you. We shall recover your comrades and complete your mission. If that does not work for you, your services are no longer needed.\"\nValorone: \"I don't know who you think you are, but you aren't Fighters Guild. You have no authority over us!\"\nLaloriaran Dynar: \"Do you challenge me, then? Do you want me to kill you to prove my combat prowess to your companions?\"\nDarien Guatier: \"I wouldn't necessarily mind seeing that. He is king of annoying.\"\nValorone: \"How do you expect us to lay down our lives for someone we never met? Trust is earned on the battlefield!\"\nLaloriaran Dynar: \"If you want to survive, if you want to win this, you must trust me. Allow me to explain why you need my leadership. We shall work this out. I understand your reservations. But with my leadership, the Fighters Guild will help us win this war.\"\nAt the war council:\nLaloriaran Dynar: \"Attention, please! I have called you all here because the moment of destiny fast approaches. The Great Shackle has been destroyed, but not before a planar vortex was established. We must destroy this vortex before it sucks the very essences of Nirn into Coldharbour. The Fighters Guild shall deal with the Chasm's defenders, but blades have little power against magic.\"\nVanus Galerion: \"And that's where my mages come in. My scouts report that some kind of magical fixtures block access to the path across the Chasm. Mages there already work on a way to overcome these fixtures, and we are prepared to lend our strength when the main forces arrive.\"\nSergeant Kamu: \"A sound plan. Plays to our unique strengths. But this one wonders, what if the mages can't overcome Molag Bal's magic?\"\nVanus Galerion: \"What a ridiculous question! Of course my mages can overcome this magic!\"\nCadwell: \"Ah, magic! The solution to all life's problems. I love magic! It's so... magical.\"\nLaloriaran Dynar: \"I have absolute confidence in Vanus and his mages.\"\nGabrielle Benele: \"Thank you, your lordship. But to be honest with you, I'm not feeling as confident as Vanus about this.\"\nLaloriaran Dynar: \"We shall fight with all our strength. There is no other option. Lives will be lost, but hopefully a world will be saved. Know that the Chasm is only the first stage of this battle. The planar vortex abides within the very heart of Molag Bal's lair.\"\nDarien Gautier: \"Oh, this just gets better and better!\"\nGabrielle Benele: \"Darien! Mind your tongue!\"\nLaloriaran Dynar: \"Darien only seeks to lighten a tense situation. Still, we have to try. To do nothing is to doom Tamriel to certain destruction.\"\nDarien Gautier: \"Well, when you put it that way, there are a lot of lovely ladies that need to be saved...\"\nVanus Galerion \"Yes, well, be that as it may, we launch our assault on the Chasm immediately. The King needs to talk to the champion and I must discuss some final details with the mages. The rest of you have your own preparations to see to, I'm sure.\"\nAt the third Anchor:\nGabrielle Benele: \"We're running out of time. I'll make sure these anchors are destroyed. You have to keep moving! Place the light and disrupt this vortex.\"\nDarien Gautier: \"I'm sticking with her, my friend. Gabrielle and me, we've been through a lot. I'm not going to leave her alone.\"\nGabrielle Benele: \"Darien ...\"\nKing Laloriaran Dynar: \"No one else dies today. That's an order. Come on, let's go set the light in place.\"\nDuring the final battle:\nVanus Galerion: \"Gabrielle, focus all your energy into this! We can't let up!\"\nGabrielle Benele: \"I'm ... doing ... my ... best!\"\nDarien Gautier: \"You deal with the crystal! We'll take care of our new guests.\"\nGabrielle Benele: \"I can feel it, Vanus! We can beat this! We can\u2014Darien, behind you!\"\nDarien Gautier: \"Have no fear, beautiful Gabrielle! I have this under control!\"\nFate.\nIn &lt;a href=\"The%20Journal%20of%20Darien%20Gautier\"&gt;his journal&lt;/a&gt;, Darien describes having visions of the &lt;a href=\"Planemeld\"&gt;Planemeld&lt;/a&gt; occurring and &lt;a href=\"Undead%20%28Online%29\"&gt;undead&lt;/a&gt; rising in a number of cities, long before any of those events happen. He also describes the landscape of Coldharbour and mentions a mysterious \"bright light\" a number of times.\nDuring the quest \"&lt;a href=\"The%20Final%20Assault\"&gt;The Final Assault&lt;/a&gt;\" in Coldharbour, speaking to Darien after entering the &lt;a href=\"Planar%20Vortex\"&gt;Planar Vortex&lt;/a&gt; will reveal that he has been having visions of the realm ever since he was a young boy. He mentions having a different dream regularly, where he sees an extremely bright blinding light and waking up in a room made entirely of light, and the dream ends. Later on, when anchors in the Vortex are destroyed and &lt;a href=\"Molag%20Bal%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Molag Bal&lt;/a&gt;'s inner council is defeated, &lt;a href=\"Meridia%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Meridia&lt;/a&gt; will bring out one of her Lights and create a protective shield for those still in the Vortex. Darien and King Dynar will be outside of it fending off Molag Bal's soldiers, and after &lt;a href=\"Vanus%20Galerion%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Vanus&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Gabrielle%20Benele\"&gt;Gabrielle&lt;/a&gt;'s teleportation spell is cast, you and everyone in the shield will be transported to the &lt;a href=\"Chapel%20of%20Light\"&gt;Chapel of Light&lt;/a&gt;. Speaking to Dynar, Vanus, and Gabrielle will reveal that none of them saw Darien get inside the shield, leading them to believe he disappeared, with no one knowing where he went.\nThe book \"&lt;a href=\"A%20Plea%20for%20Help\"&gt;A Plea for Help&lt;/a&gt;\", found within the library of the &lt;a href=\"Temple%20of%20Ire\"&gt;Temple of Ire&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Orsinium%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Orsinium&lt;/a&gt;, is written by Darien and addressed to you. He is trying desperately to reach you and does not know where he is or whether he is even alive, all that he knows is that he is surrounded by bright white light, which he believes may be the &lt;a href=\"Colored%20Rooms\"&gt;Colored Rooms&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href=\"Alinon%20the%20Alchemist\"&gt;Alinon the Alchemist&lt;/a&gt; appears at Scarp Keep, saying he was hoping to meet Darien here. In &lt;a href=\"Anvil%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Anvil&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Gabrielle%20Benele\"&gt;Gabrielle Benele&lt;/a&gt; will be researching what happened to Darien, and assumes that since he was not found dead and did not come back, he simply returned somewhere else. Telling her of the aforementioned note will lead her to know where to look for Darien. In the &lt;a href=\"Clockwork%20City%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Clockwork City&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"The%20Grand%20Prognosticator\"&gt;The Grand Prognosticator&lt;/a&gt; tells you a prophecy of things to come and mentions a \"&lt;a href=\"Golden%20Knight\"&gt;Golden Knight&lt;/a&gt;,\" possibly referring to Darien.\nWhile aiding the &lt;a href=\"Psijic%20Order%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Psijic Order&lt;/a&gt; during the events of , the &lt;a href=\"Vestige\"&gt;Vestige&lt;/a&gt; encountered &lt;a href=\"Meridia%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Meridia's&lt;/a&gt; champion, a being called the Golden Knight who wielded &lt;a href=\"Dawnbreaker\"&gt;Dawnbreaker&lt;/a&gt;, on several occasions. After the Golden Knight was captured by &lt;a href=\"Mephala%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Mephala&lt;/a&gt;, the Vestige spoke with Meridia and she revealed that her champion was Darien. The Vestige was able to rescue Darien from the &lt;a href=\"Spiral%20Skein\"&gt;Spiral Skein&lt;/a&gt;, and he aided them in foiling &lt;a href=\"Nocturnal%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Nocturnal's&lt;/a&gt; scheme to remake reality using the &lt;a href=\"Crystal%20Tower%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Crystal Tower&lt;/a&gt;, though Nocturnal's Champion, &lt;a href=\"Veya%20Releth\"&gt;Veya Releth&lt;/a&gt;, stole and corrupted Dawnbreaker.\nWhen Darien and the Vestige entered Crystal Tower to confront Nocturnal, they were confronted again by Veya. Though they were able to defeat her and reclaim Dawnbreaker, Darien had to sacrifice himself to purge Dawnbreaker of Nocturnal's corruption. The Vestige then wielded Dawnbreaker against Nocturnal and used the artifact to restore the Crystal of Transparent Law at the summit of Crystal Tower, thus foiling Nocturnal's plan once and for all.\nAfter the events of \"&lt;a href=\"A%20New%20Alliance\"&gt;A New Alliance&lt;/a&gt;,\" the Vestige can overhear a guard talking about a teleporting book in &lt;a href=\"Alinor%20Royal%20Palace\"&gt;Alinor Royal Palace&lt;/a&gt;. The book is written by Darien, revealing that he has found himself once again in the Colored Rooms and that his light is fading and he fears he will cease to exist soon, while also wishing farewell to the Vestige and warning them not to trust Meridia.

For the next ten years, Sheogorath sealed his link to Vaermina, putting an end to his source of inspiration. As time went by, he began to think Vaermina was never there to supplement his dreams, which led him to question the existence of gods in general. Darius, in turn, started to write extensively on the foolishness of &lt;a href=\"Tamriel\"&gt;Tamriel&lt;/a&gt;'s faithful, serfs and nobility alike. Naturally, this produced actual hatred for Darius, unrivaled by that made from his previous works. This culminated, ten years later, with his final work\u2014\"The Noblest Fool\"\u2014in which he ridiculed &lt;a href=\"Tiber%20Septim\"&gt;Tiber Septim&lt;/a&gt;'s status as the &lt;a href=\"Nine%20Divines\"&gt;Ninth Divine&lt;/a&gt;. The King of Daenia, himself a victim of ridicule by Darius' philosophical works, used this as a pretext to have Darius executed, causing\u00a0Vaermina to lose her wager with Sheogorath."}

The purpose of the Anchors are to pull Tamriel into Coldharbour, thus merging the two realms together into a single, nightmarish hellscape. They will spawn periodically across Tamriel in set locations called Dolmens, which are in each subregion of &lt;a href=\"Cyrodiil%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Cyrodiil&lt;/a&gt; and every &lt;a href=\"Alliance\"&gt;Alliance&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"zone\"&gt;zone&lt;/a&gt;. All dolmens are protected by a large number of Daedric and undead guardians that must be destroyed to deactivate all 5 &lt;a href=\"Dark%20Anchor%20Pinion\"&gt;Anchor Pinions&lt;/a&gt;, with more powerful enemies appearing once 4 of the pinions have been deactivated.\nIt is possible for higher level players to defeat the Daedric protectors and return the Anchors by themselves, however it is recommended to battle them in parties, as they will be tough competitors. Dolmens are used to gain &lt;a href=\"experience\"&gt;experience&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Fighters%20Guild%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Fighters Guild&lt;/a&gt; skill line progress, and &lt;a href=\"Overland%20sets\"&gt;overland&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Jewelry%20%28Online%29\"&gt;jewelry&lt;/a&gt; sets.

This ritual causes the anchor's chains to fall to the ground, and Daedra and undead will begin to spawn. The cultists can be attacked at any time, and doing so will cause the chains to immediately fall to the ground. This can be useful, as the distinctive visual effect (dark clouds, unnatural lightning, and chains) signals to other players that the dolmen is active, who can assist in destroying it.\nDefeating enemies sends their &lt;a href=\"animus\"&gt;animus&lt;/a&gt; into a pinion. Closing a pinion restores nearby players' stats, and gives the closer the Power of the Daedra visual effect for 30 seconds. Closing the fourth pinion will automatically defeat all enemies present. Standing in one place for too long will drop lightning down where the player is (\"Static Charge\"), dealing moderate damage.\nThe pinions require more enemies to be defeated with more players present. If one runs far enough away from the dolmen, the enemies chasing them will &lt;a href=\"Leashing\"&gt;return&lt;/a&gt; to the dolmen and stand passively until engaged again. Players should hit at least some of the enemies in order to be eligible for rewards. If a player that has not participated closes the final pinion, they will earn rewards but not achievement progress.\nCreatures.\nNormal:\nElite:\nBosses:\nQuotes.\nMolag Bal yells when he deploys the anchor:\nWhen he summons the lieutenants:\nWhen he summons the generals:\nAfter the bosses' defeat:\nAnd after the anchor is destroyed:\nRitual.\nThere are several rituals used to summon a Dark Anchor, they are recited by Worm cultists periodically:\nThe Worm cultists will then either be sacrificed to Molag Bal or become alerted and attack the &lt;a href=\"Vestige\"&gt;Vestige&lt;/a&gt;.\nReward.\nReward for each destroyed Dark Anchor is distributed evenly:"}

{"id": "307628", "revid": "25646820", "url": "https://elderscrolls.fandom.com/wiki?curid=307628", "title": "Dark Brotherhood", "text": "The Dark Brotherhood is an infamous faction of assassins that are spread across all of &lt;a href=\"Tamriel\"&gt;Tamriel&lt;/a&gt;. Working as both a business and a cult, the Brotherhood was feared across Tamriel. Many knew of its existence, and those who did chose to tolerate it, in fear of meeting their own demise.\nHistory.\n&lt;a href=\"Second%20Era\"&gt;Second Era&lt;/a&gt;.\nFounding.\nThe Dark Brotherhood originally sprung from a religious order called the &lt;a href=\"Morag%20Tong\"&gt;Morag Tong&lt;/a&gt;, who worshipped the &lt;a href=\"Daedric%20Prince\"&gt;Daedric Prince&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Mephala\"&gt;Mephala&lt;/a&gt;. Mephala encouraged the Morag Tong to commit ritual murders. At this time, the Order was discarded as obscure cultists due to the lack of a leader in their group. This was all to change with the coming of the &lt;a href=\"Night%20Mother\"&gt;Night Mother&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe Night Mother was the supposed lover and partner of &lt;a href=\"Sithis\"&gt;Sithis&lt;/a&gt;. It was widely believed that the Night Mother was the source of the doctrine dictating how the Morag Tong (and eventually the Dark Brotherhood) worked as a group. Some actually thought the Night Mother was the Daedric Prince Mephala, in the form of a mortal &lt;a href=\"Dunmer\"&gt;Dunmer&lt;/a&gt; woman.\nSome time after &lt;a href=\"2E%20324\"&gt;2E 324&lt;/a&gt;, the last living Night Mother resided in &lt;a href=\"Bravil\"&gt;Bravil&lt;/a&gt;. The Night Mother bore Sithis five children, whom she then killed so that their souls could go to the Dread Father. The act was considered too cruel by the people of her village, who then killed her and burned her house down. Thirty years later, an unnamed man heard voices in his head, not from Sithis, but the Night Mother herself. He became the first of many Listeners to come.\nThe first known mention of the Dark Brotherhood was the journal of Blood Queen Arlimahera of Hegathe, written in 2E 412. Arlimahera wrote that her family had employed the Brotherhood since her grandfather's time.\n&lt;a href=\"Third%20Era\"&gt;Third Era&lt;/a&gt;.\nDuring the events of &lt;a href=\"Warp%20in%20the%20West\"&gt;Warp in the West&lt;/a&gt;, the Dark Brotherhood was active across &lt;a href=\"Tamriel\"&gt;Tamriel&lt;/a&gt;. Their existence was accepted and widely ignored. During this time, the Dark Brotherhood worshiped the Daedric Prince &lt;a href=\"Mephala\"&gt;Mephala&lt;/a&gt; as their leader, not Sithis. This was probably caused by the then-recent split from the Morag Tong.\nDuring the late Third Era, the &lt;a href=\"Morrowind\"&gt;Morrowind&lt;/a&gt; Dark Brotherhood headquarters were located not far from the city of &lt;a href=\"Mournhold\"&gt;Mournhold&lt;/a&gt;. Their local leader, an &lt;a href=\"Imperial\"&gt;Imperial&lt;/a&gt; known as &lt;a href=\"Severa%20Magia\"&gt;Severa Magia&lt;/a&gt;, called herself a &lt;a href=\"Night%20Mother\"&gt;Night Mother&lt;/a&gt;. She lived in &lt;a href=\"Ald%20Sotha\"&gt;Ald Sotha&lt;/a&gt;.\nOblivion Crisis.\nDuring the &lt;a href=\"Oblivion%20Crisis\"&gt;Oblivion Crisis&lt;/a&gt;, the Dark Brotherhood was infamous and very well-known throughout &lt;a href=\"Cyrodiil\"&gt;Cyrodiil&lt;/a&gt; and the rest of &lt;a href=\"Tamriel\"&gt;Tamriel&lt;/a&gt;. Within Cyrodiil, the Brotherhood was situated in &lt;a href=\"Cheydinhal\"&gt;Cheydinhal&lt;/a&gt;, specifically the &lt;a href=\"Cheydinhal%20Sanctuary\"&gt;Cheydinhal Sanctuary&lt;/a&gt;.\nDuring this time, the &lt;a href=\"Listener\"&gt;Listener&lt;/a&gt;, the highest-ranking member of the Dark Brotherhood aside from the Night Mother herself, was &lt;a href=\"Ungolim\"&gt;Ungolim&lt;/a&gt;, a &lt;a href=\"Wood%20Elf\"&gt;Wood Elf&lt;/a&gt; who lived in the town of &lt;a href=\"Bravil\"&gt;Bravil&lt;/a&gt;. The Listener heard the words of the Night Mother and, from her lips, the Listener received assassination requests in the form of prayers, named the Black Sacrament, by potential employers, marking how contracts were initiated and fulfilled. Each night he would visit the &lt;a href=\"Lucky%20Old%20Lady\"&gt;statue of the Lucky Lady&lt;/a&gt;. Unknown to all but the Listener and select members of the &lt;a href=\"Black%20Hand\"&gt;Black Hand&lt;/a&gt;, the statue of the Lucky Lady was actually the entrance to the Night Mother's Crypt.\n&lt;a href=\"Fourth%20Era\"&gt;Fourth Era&lt;/a&gt;.\nRecession.\nSince the &lt;a href=\"Oblivion%20Crisis\"&gt;Oblivion Crisis&lt;/a&gt;, the Brotherhood had been fighting for survival. They had lost virtually all influence within Tamriel and had resorted to doing petty murders within &lt;a href=\"Skyrim\"&gt;Skyrim&lt;/a&gt;.\nOn the 27th of Sun's Height in &lt;a href=\"4E%20188\"&gt;4E 188&lt;/a&gt;, the city of &lt;a href=\"Wayrest\"&gt;Wayrest&lt;/a&gt; was lost to corsairs, and by the 5th of Last Seed of the same year, the &lt;a href=\"Wayrest%20Sanctuary\"&gt;Wayrest Sanctuary&lt;/a&gt; was raided and destroyed by corsairs. There were no survivors. On the same day, the Black Hand ordered the &lt;a href=\"Corinthe%20Sanctuary\"&gt;Corinthe Sanctuary&lt;/a&gt; closed, and its members sent to the Cheydinhal Sanctuary in &lt;a href=\"Cyrodiil\"&gt;Cyrodiil&lt;/a&gt;.\nBy the 27th of Hearthfire in &lt;a href=\"4E%20188\"&gt;4E 188&lt;/a&gt;, the situation in &lt;a href=\"Bravil\"&gt;Bravil&lt;/a&gt; grew ever more threatening. The city had erupted in violence, due to a war of control waged by Cyrodiil's two largest skooma traffickers. By the 1st of Sun's Dusk of the same year, the statue of the &lt;a href=\"Lucky%20Old%20Lady\"&gt;Lucky Old Lady&lt;/a&gt; was destroyed, and &lt;a href=\"Alisanne%20Dupre\"&gt;Alisanne Dupre&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"Listener\"&gt;Listener&lt;/a&gt;, left her private residence to guard the &lt;a href=\"Crypt%20of%20the%20Night%20Mother\"&gt;Crypt of the Night Mother&lt;/a&gt;. Rasha, the Speaker, sent &lt;a href=\"Garnag\"&gt;Garnag&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Adronica\"&gt;Adronica&lt;/a&gt; to aid in the crypts defense, but on the 21st of Sun's Dusk, Garnag returned alone with the stone coffin of the Night Mother. The Crypt of the Night Mother had been raided, with Adronica cut to pieces and Alisanne Dupre burned alive in a storm of mage fire.\nOn the 4th of Evening Star in 4E 189, Rasha declared himself the Listener, claiming the Night Mother had spoken to him. He could not, however, name the &lt;a href=\"Binding%20Words\"&gt;Binding Words&lt;/a&gt;, so &lt;a href=\"Cicero\"&gt;Cicero&lt;/a&gt; killed him. By the 10th of Sun's Dawn in &lt;a href=\"4E%20190\"&gt;4E 190&lt;/a&gt;, there were only three people left in the Cheydinhal Sanctuary: Cicero, Garnag and &lt;a href=\"Pontius\"&gt;Pontius&lt;/a&gt;. On the 16th of Rain's Hand in &lt;a href=\"4E%20191\"&gt;4E 191&lt;/a&gt;, Pontius was killed, and on the 29th of Last Seed of the same year, Garnag was presumably killed.\n&lt;a href=\"Dragon%20Crisis\"&gt;Dragon Crisis&lt;/a&gt;.\nAt the beginning of the &lt;a href=\"Dragon%20Crisis\"&gt;Dragon Crisis&lt;/a&gt; in 4E 201, the Dark Brotherhood was led by &lt;a href=\"Astrid\"&gt;Astrid&lt;/a&gt;. Under her leadership the &lt;a href=\"Five%20Tenets\"&gt;Five Tenets&lt;/a&gt; were discarded, breaking with the traditions and culture of the previous two eras when the Brotherhood was operated as a cult as well as a business. The Dark Brotherhood in Skyrim was reduced to a single &lt;a href=\"Dark%20Brotherhood%20Sanctuary\"&gt;sanctuary&lt;/a&gt;, located just outside of &lt;a href=\"Falkreath\"&gt;Falkreath&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Night%20Mother\"&gt;Night Mother's&lt;/a&gt; coffin traveled with The Night Mother's Keeper, an eccentric jester named Cicero. The wagon Cicero was using to transport the coffin broke down near &lt;a href=\"Loreius%20Farm\"&gt;Loreius Farm&lt;/a&gt;.\nRumors of a child who ran away from &lt;a href=\"Honorhall%20Orphanage\"&gt;Honorhall Orphanage&lt;/a&gt; were quickly spread throughout Skyrim. The child was rumored to be &lt;a href=\"Aventus%20Aretino\"&gt;Aventus Aretino&lt;/a&gt;. Curious of the rumors, the Dragonborn traveled to the Aretino Residence in Windhelm and found Aventus performing the Black Sacrament. Thus, a contract was now made to kill &lt;a href=\"Grelod%20the%20Kind\"&gt;Grelod the Kind&lt;/a&gt;, the hated owner of Honorhall Orphanage. The Dragonborn traveled to Riften and entered the orphanage, killing Grelod, to which the orphans cheered. Aventus rewarded the Dragonborn with the &lt;a href=\"Aretino%20Family%20Heirloom\"&gt;Aretino Family Heirloom&lt;/a&gt;.\nAfter some days, the Dragonborn received a &lt;a href=\"Mysterious%20Note%20%28Dark%20Brotherhood%29\"&gt;mysterious note&lt;/a&gt; with an imprint of a black hand and the words \"We Know\" written beneath it. Sometime after receiving the note, the Dragonborn slept. Shortly later, the Dragonborn woke up in an &lt;a href=\"Abandoned%20Shack%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;abandoned shack&lt;/a&gt;, located in the marshes of Morthal. A Dark Brotherhood assassin, Astrid, was in the cabin as well. She revealed that the Dark Brotherhood was aware of the murdering of Grelod and were pleased with it, but since Aventus Aretino performed the Black Sacrament, the contract for killing Grelod the Kind was for the Dark Brotherhood, and the Dragonborn stole that contract. Astrid demanded that a debt had to be paid for the kill that was stolen from them. She kidnapped three other people and brought them to the shack, along with the Dragonborn. Astrid told the Dragonborn that there was a contract out on one of them, and that the Dragonborn had to figure out who to kill. The Last Dragonborn killed at least one of the people, and then Astrid made an invitation for the Dragonborn: to come to the Dark Brotherhood Sanctuary in Falkreath and become a member of the Dark Brotherhood.\nDestruction of the Falkreath Sanctuary.\nAfter poisoning and killing Emperor Titus Mede II, Commander Maro intercepts the Dragonborn's escape and reveals the slain Emperor was just a double, and that a traitor within the Brotherhood have informed him of the hit in exchange for their safety. Maro goes back on his words, however, and proceeds to send his men to destroy the Falkreath sanctuary. Fighting through the destruction, the Dragonborn survives the onslaught by hiding in the Night Mother's coffin. Being rescued by &lt;a href=\"Babette\"&gt;Babette&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Nazir\"&gt;Nazir&lt;/a&gt;, the Dragonborn then discovers that Astrid herself is the traitor, who then apologizes for double-crossing them and pleads that the Dragonborn kills her. The Dragonborn becomes the leader of the Brotherhood after Astrid's death.\nThe remaining members of the Brotherhood are relocated to the Dawnstar Sanctuary, after the sanctuary was acquired in &lt;a href=\"The%20Cure%20for%20Madness\"&gt;The Cure for Madness&lt;/a&gt;. The only survivors of the Falkreath sanctuary onslaught are Babette, Nazir, Cicero (if he is spared) and the Dragonborn, now the Listener and leader of the Brotherhood. After the new hideout is furnished by Delvin Mallory, several generic Dark Brotherhood Initiates will appear as followers. Radiant contracts can be acquired from the Night Mother.\nCulture.\nPurpose.\nThe Dark Brotherhood had always been an organization with the purpose of assassination and professional killing. They were the harbingers of death and executors of silent, covert assassinations. Besides working in the field of assassinations, the organization itself was a clandestine operations group. The Brotherhood's divine purpose was to serve The Dread Lord and follow his desires, which they achieved through the word of the Night Mother.\nThe Order's leaders and assassins would sometimes take several concise, lengthy steps to complete an assassination attempt. For example, during the &lt;a href=\"Fourth%20Era\"&gt;Fourth Era&lt;/a&gt;, when the Dark Brotherhood attempted the assassination of Emperor &lt;a href=\"Titus%20Mede%20II\"&gt;Titus Mede II&lt;/a&gt;, they went through many phases in order to complete the assignment, including the assassination of &lt;a href=\"Vittoria%20Vici\"&gt;Vittoria Vici&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Gaius%20Maro\"&gt;Gaius Maro&lt;/a&gt;, and even the Emperor's personal chef, &lt;a href=\"Balagog%20gro-Nolob\"&gt;the Gourmet&lt;/a&gt;.\nInfluence.\nThroughout the &lt;a href=\"Second%20Era\"&gt;second&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Third%20Era\"&gt;third&lt;/a&gt; eras, the mention of the Dark Brotherhood would cause both &lt;a href=\"Men\"&gt;Men&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Mer\"&gt;Mer&lt;/a&gt; to shudder where they stood. Commoners and noblemen alike feared and loathed them.\nWith multiple sanctuaries across &lt;a href=\"Tamriel\"&gt;Tamriel&lt;/a&gt; full of trained, hardened assassins, the Brotherhood had influence in every province on every level. Their ongoing feud with the &lt;a href=\"Morag%20Tong\"&gt;Morag Tong&lt;/a&gt; and territorial dispute over &lt;a href=\"Morrowind\"&gt;Morrowind&lt;/a&gt; led the two factions to wage war on each other.\nBy the events of &lt;a href=\"Dragon%20Crisis\"&gt;Dragon Crisis&lt;/a&gt;, the Brotherhood's influence had dropped dramatically; their influence on Tamriel was all but non-existent after &lt;a href=\"Corsair%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Corsairs&lt;/a&gt; conducted multiple raids on their sanctuaries on the 5th of &lt;a href=\"Last%20Seed\"&gt;Last Seed&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"4E%20188\"&gt;4E 188&lt;/a&gt;. It was unknown how many sanctuaries outside &lt;a href=\"Skyrim\"&gt;Skyrim&lt;/a&gt;, if any, survived the raids, be they destroyed or ordered closed by the &lt;a href=\"Black%20Hand\"&gt;Black Hand&lt;/a&gt;. It was thought that during the &lt;a href=\"Fourth%20Era\"&gt;Fourth Era&lt;/a&gt;, the Dark Brotherhood's influence was on the rise again, with guidance from their &lt;a href=\"Night%20Mother\"&gt;Night Mother&lt;/a&gt;, in the far north of Skyrim.\nReligion.\nThe religion of the Dark Brotherhood focused on the worship of &lt;a href=\"Sithis\"&gt;Sithis&lt;/a&gt;. Sithis, also known as the Dread Lord or the Dread Father, was the representation of the &lt;a href=\"Void\"&gt;Void&lt;/a&gt;.\nAside from Sithis, all members of the Brotherhood revered their unholy matron, the Night Mother, who served as their source of contracts. &lt;a href=\"Listener\"&gt;Listener&lt;/a&gt;s and Keepers were intimately connected to the matron and would defend her with their lives (as in the cases of Cicero and &lt;a href=\"Alisanne%20Dupre\"&gt;Alisanne Dupre&lt;/a&gt;).\nThe Dark Brotherhood was also known to have worshiped Daedric Prince &lt;a href=\"Mephala\"&gt;Mephala&lt;/a&gt; during the earlier periods of their existence. This was most likely because of their relation to the &lt;a href=\"Morag%20Tong\"&gt;Morag Tong&lt;/a&gt;, a religious order from Morrowind who committed assassinations and murders in the name of Mephala. The Brotherhood split from them some time in the Second Era.\nRegulations.\nThe Five Tenets.\nThe Five Tenets are the rules and morals the Brotherhood followed up to and during the &lt;a href=\"Oblivion%20Crisis\"&gt;Oblivion Crisis&lt;/a&gt;. If a member broke or neglected to follow one of the Tenets, they were threatened with expulsion from the Brotherhood or worse.\nThere are five tenets in all, and they are as follows:\nThe Tenets were abandoned during the &lt;a href=\"Fourth%20Era\"&gt;Fourth Era&lt;/a&gt; under Astrid's leadership.\nHierarchy.\nThe Dark Brotherhood was an organized guild of assassins; they were composed of a governing body, along with several smaller sections and groups.\nThe Black Hand.\nThe governing body of the Dark Brotherhood was called the &lt;a href=\"Black%20Hand\"&gt;Black Hand&lt;/a&gt;. It was composed of five members: four &lt;a href=\"Speaker\"&gt;Speaker&lt;/a&gt;s (Index, middle, ring and little fingers) and a &lt;a href=\"Listener\"&gt;Listener&lt;/a&gt; (thumb).\nThe Listener telepathically listened to and received commands from the &lt;a href=\"Night%20Mother\"&gt;Night Mother&lt;/a&gt;, relaying them to the four Speakers. The Speakers would then issue the commands and initiate the contracts to be completed by the Brotherhood's assassins. Each Speaker had their own personal assistants called &lt;a href=\"%23The%20Black%20Hand\"&gt;Silencer&lt;/a&gt;s, which were the \"nails\" of the Black Hand.\nSilencers could be deployed to complete contracts and eliminate any target(s) that they saw fit. The Silencers qualified as members of the Black Hand, but their existence was kept secret from the rest of the Dark Brotherhood.\nRecruitment.\nAs the Dark Brotherhood was a shadowy, mysterious organization of assassins spread out over most of &lt;a href=\"Tamriel\"&gt;Tamriel&lt;/a&gt;, the identities of its members were generally unknown by the organization as a whole. The Brotherhood's methods of recruiting were shadowy in nature and clouded in mystery. However, it was known that the Brotherhood did not just blindly accept new recruits and members; a person who wished to join the Dark Brotherhood had to first be noticed by the Brotherhood and demonstrate his or her skills in sneaking and assassination.\nWhen a person committed murder, a Speaker would approach the killer and ask them to join the Dark Brotherhood, and if the offer was accepted, the killer would be given a formal, organized contract with a specific target to kill.\n&lt;a href=\"Argonians\"&gt;Argonians&lt;/a&gt; born under &lt;a href=\"birthsign\"&gt;the sign&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"The%20Shadow\"&gt;The Shadow&lt;/a&gt; underwent training in stealth and combat as &lt;a href=\"Shadowscale\"&gt;Shadowscale&lt;/a&gt;s. This training also enabled them to transfer to the Dark Brotherhood.\nContacting.\nContacting the Brotherhood to order an assassination involved performing the &lt;a href=\"Black%20Sacrament\"&gt;Black Sacrament&lt;/a&gt;. This ritual included creating an effigy of the intended victim out of actual human body parts and continuously stabbing it with a dagger rubbed with the petals of the &lt;a href=\"Nightshade\"&gt;Nightshade&lt;/a&gt; flower.\nThe following plea must be whispered while stabbing the effigy:\n\"Sweet Mother, sweet Mother, send your child unto me, for the sins of the unworthy must be baptized in blood and fear.\"\nThe Night Mother then relayed the plea to a &lt;a href=\"Listener\"&gt;Listener&lt;/a&gt;, who in turn informed a &lt;a href=\"Speaker\"&gt;Speaker&lt;/a&gt; to send an assassin to the client. Once the ritual was complete, the one who performed it would be met by the Brotherhood representative.\nKnown sanctuaries.\nCyrodiil.\nCheydinhal.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Cheydinhal%20Sanctuary\"&gt;Cheydinhal Sanctuary&lt;/a&gt; was the primary headquarters of the Dark Brotherhood in Cyrodiil. Situated in the basement of an &lt;a href=\"Abandoned%20House%20%28Cheydinhal%29\"&gt;abandoned house&lt;/a&gt; beneath the surface in eastern Cheydinhal, the Sanctuary could be accessed through a trap door in the well behind the house.\nThe Sanctuary contained five rooms: the main hall, the living quarters, the training room, &lt;a href=\"Ocheeva\"&gt;Ocheeva's&lt;/a&gt; Room and &lt;a href=\"Vicente%20Valtieri\"&gt;Vicente's&lt;/a&gt; Room.\nBruma.\nThe Dark Brotherhood &lt;a href=\"Dark%20Brotherhood%20Sanctuary%20%28Bruma%29\"&gt;had a sanctuary&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Bruma%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;Bruma&lt;/a&gt;. It was destroyed sometime before &lt;a href=\"Fourth%20Era\"&gt;4E 186&lt;/a&gt;, and everyone within the sanctuary aside from Cicero was killed. Cicero escaped and relocated to the &lt;a href=\"Dark%20Brotherhood%20Sanctuary%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;Cheydinhal Sanctuary&lt;/a&gt;.\nGold Coast.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Dark%20Brotherhood%20Sanctuary%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Gold Coast sanctuary&lt;/a&gt; was located north of the cities of &lt;a href=\"Anvil\"&gt;Anvil&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Kvatch\"&gt;Kvatch&lt;/a&gt;, and south of &lt;a href=\"Sutch\"&gt;Sutch&lt;/a&gt;, at the foothold of the then-structure &lt;a href=\"Varen%27s%20Wall%20%28Location%29\"&gt;Varen's Wall&lt;/a&gt;. It was managed by &lt;a href=\"Speaker%20Terenus\"&gt;Speaker Terenus&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Astara%20Caerellius\"&gt;Astara Caerellius&lt;/a&gt; around &lt;a href=\"2E%20582\"&gt;2E 582&lt;/a&gt;. The location was discovered by defected member &lt;a href=\"The%20Black%20Dragon%20%28Online%29\"&gt;The Black Dragon&lt;/a&gt; and was planned to be attacked by the &lt;a href=\"Order%20of%20the%20Hour\"&gt;Order of the Hour&lt;/a&gt;, but after the &lt;a href=\"Vestige\"&gt;Vestige&lt;/a&gt; killed their leader, &lt;a href=\"Primate%20Artorius\"&gt;Primate Artorius&lt;/a&gt;, the threat had ended. By &lt;a href=\"3E%20433\"&gt;3E 433&lt;/a&gt;, no trace of the sanctuary remained.\nSkyrim.\nFalkreath.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Falkreath\"&gt;Falkreath&lt;/a&gt; Sanctuary was the Brotherhood's &lt;a href=\"Skyrim\"&gt;Skyrim&lt;/a&gt; headquarters at the beginning of the &lt;a href=\"Fourth%20Era\"&gt;Fourth Era&lt;/a&gt;. It was also the location of the &lt;a href=\"Night%20Mother\"&gt;Night Mother&lt;/a&gt;'s Crypt for the earlier part of the Fourth Era.\nThe Falkreath Sanctuary was ransacked and many of its occupants killed in &lt;a href=\"4E%20201\"&gt;4E 201&lt;/a&gt; by &lt;a href=\"Penitus%20Oculatus\"&gt;Penitus Oculatus&lt;/a&gt; agents.\nDawnstar.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Dawnstar%20Sanctuary\"&gt;Dawnstar Sanctuary&lt;/a&gt; was one of the Dark Brotherhood sanctuaries in Skyrim; it was said to be one of the oldest of the Brotherhood's sanctuaries in Skyrim. By the &lt;a href=\"Fourth%20Era\"&gt;Fourth Era&lt;/a&gt;, the sanctuary had been abandoned and had not been occupied for over a century.\nAfter the &lt;a href=\"Death%20Incarnate\"&gt;destruction&lt;/a&gt; of the Falkreath Sanctuary, the &lt;a href=\"Dawnstar\"&gt;Dawnstar&lt;/a&gt; sanctuary became the headquarters for the Dark Brotherhood in Skyrim. The sanctuary was then renovated and once again put to use. &lt;a href=\"Delvin%20Mallory%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Delvin Mallory&lt;/a&gt; of the &lt;a href=\"Thieves%20Guild\"&gt;Thieves Guild&lt;/a&gt; helped in the restoration process. A &lt;a href=\"torture%20chamber\"&gt;torture chamber&lt;/a&gt; was added to the sanctuary, as was the Night Mother's Crypt.\nHigh Rock.\nThe Brotherhood held one sanctuary in the province of &lt;a href=\"High%20Rock\"&gt;High Rock&lt;/a&gt;, which was in &lt;a href=\"Wayrest\"&gt;Wayrest&lt;/a&gt;. On the 27th of &lt;a href=\"Sun%27s%20Height\"&gt;Sun's Height&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"4E%20188\"&gt;4E 188&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Corsair\"&gt;Corsair&lt;/a&gt;s besieged Wayrest, and the city was lost. On the 5th of &lt;a href=\"Last%20Seed\"&gt;Last Seed&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"4E%20188\"&gt;4E 188&lt;/a&gt;, the news that the &lt;a href=\"Wayrest%20Sanctuary\"&gt;Wayrest Sanctuary&lt;/a&gt; was destroyed by the corsairs reached Cicero at Cheydinhal Sanctuary. The destruction of Wayrest sanctuary left only three active sanctuaries: Cheydinhal, &lt;a href=\"Falkreath\"&gt;Falkreath&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Corinth\"&gt;Corinth&lt;/a&gt;.\nBlack Marsh.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Xith-Izkul%20Sanctuary\"&gt;Xith-Izkul Sanctuary&lt;/a&gt; in Black Marsh was located between the swamps between &lt;a href=\"Blackwood\"&gt;Blackwood&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Murkmire\"&gt;Murkmire&lt;/a&gt;. It was run by &lt;a href=\"Speaker%20Arawen\"&gt;Speaker Arawen&lt;/a&gt;, though it was purified by the &lt;a href=\"Black%20Hand\"&gt;Black Hand&lt;/a&gt; as they sent &lt;a href=\"Silencer\"&gt;Silencer&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Lyra%20Viria\"&gt;Lyra Viria&lt;/a&gt; to execute the inhabitants. &lt;a href=\"Green-Venom-Tongue\"&gt;Green-Venom-Tongue&lt;/a&gt; and the Vestige later visited a number of years after the purification in &lt;a href=\"2E%20582\"&gt;2E 582&lt;/a&gt;, though only found &lt;a href=\"Dark%20Guardian%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Dark Guardians&lt;/a&gt; and lost spirits. Using a unique resin, they witnessed Lyra assassinate all the members and report to Speaker Arawen at the shrine of Sithis.\nElsweyr.\nThe Dark Brotherhood's sanctuary in &lt;a href=\"Elsweyr\"&gt;Elsweyr&lt;/a&gt; was in the city of &lt;a href=\"Corinthe\"&gt;Corinthe&lt;/a&gt;. On the 5th of &lt;a href=\"Last%20Seed\"&gt;Last Seed&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"4E%20188\"&gt;4E 188&lt;/a&gt;, as the Dark Brotherhood Sanctuaries across &lt;a href=\"Tamriel\"&gt;Tamriel&lt;/a&gt; were being destroyed and/or abandoned, as the Dark Brotherhood was collapsing and their entire world was crumbling all around them, the &lt;a href=\"Black%20Hand\"&gt;Black Hand&lt;/a&gt; ordered the closing of the &lt;a href=\"Corinthe%20Sanctuary\"&gt;Corinthe Sanctuary&lt;/a&gt;.\nMorrowind.\nA number of Dark Brotherhood assassins attempted to set up base at the ruin of &lt;a href=\"Ald%20Sotha\"&gt;Ald Sotha&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"3E%20427\"&gt;3E 427&lt;/a&gt;, though were stopped by the &lt;a href=\"Morag%20Tong\"&gt;Morag Tong&lt;/a&gt;. The same year, more Dark Brotherhood members resided in the ruins of &lt;a href=\"Old%20Mournhold\"&gt;Old Mournhold&lt;/a&gt;, though were also exterminated.\nSimilar organizations.\nMorag Tong.\nThe Dark Brotherhood was formed as the result of a split from the &lt;a href=\"Morag%20Tong\"&gt;Morag Tong&lt;/a&gt;, a religious order that dealt in some of the customs that the Brotherhood is infamous for. This split happened some time in the Second Era.\nThe Morag Tong were worshipers of &lt;a href=\"Daedra\"&gt;Daedra&lt;/a&gt;, specifically &lt;a href=\"Mephala\"&gt;Mephala&lt;/a&gt;. In the early years of the Morag Tong, the faction was disorganized, and thus never committed murders or assassinations of high-value targets or people of importance. However, their ways of spreading influence changed with the rise of the &lt;a href=\"Night%20Mother\"&gt;Night Mother&lt;/a&gt;.\nMurders would be committed by the group because it was believed that with every murder, Mephala would become stronger. The murders of important people and powerful men were seen as what strengthened Mephala the most. This belief is said to have originated in &lt;a href=\"2E%20324\"&gt;2E 324&lt;/a&gt;. In this year, the &lt;a href=\"Potentate\"&gt;Potentate&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Versidue%20Shaie\"&gt;Versidue Shaie&lt;/a&gt; was murdered in his palace, in the present-day kingdom of &lt;a href=\"Senchal\"&gt;Senchal&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Elsweyr\"&gt;Elsweyr&lt;/a&gt;. The Night Mother wrote the words \"MORAG TONG\" on the wall with the victim's blood.\nUnlike the Morag Tong, which was strictly a religious cult, the Brotherhood served as both a cult and a business.\nShadowscales.\nIn &lt;a href=\"Black%20Marsh\"&gt;Black Marsh&lt;/a&gt;, the homeland of the &lt;a href=\"Argonian\"&gt;Argonian&lt;/a&gt; race, there lived a group called the &lt;a href=\"Shadowscale\"&gt;Shadowscale&lt;/a&gt;s. They were highly trained assassins trained in the arts of stealth and assassination from birth. One had to be born under the sign of the &lt;a href=\"Shadow\"&gt;Shadow&lt;/a&gt; to become a Shadowscale.\nDuring the events of , &lt;a href=\"Veezara\"&gt;Veezara&lt;/a&gt; claimed he was the last remaining member of the Shadowscales. Veezara was eventually injured by Cicero, nearly dying in the process.\nThieves Guild.\nThe Dark Brotherhood had a strong connection with the Thieves Guild, and despite their differences in purpose, ethics and ideas and policies, the Dark Brotherhood and the Thieves Guild have always had a good connection between each other. This is especially true with the Dark Brotherhood and the Thieves Guild in &lt;a href=\"Skyrim\"&gt;Skyrim&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href=\"Delvin%20Mallory%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Delvin Mallory&lt;/a&gt; of the Thieves Guild and Astrid of the Dark Brotherhood in Skyrim have had a good relationship with each other in friendship and in business."}

{"id": "1509", "revid": "32911304", "url": "https://elderscrolls.fandom.com/wiki?curid=1509", "title": "Dark Brotherhood (Oblivion)", "text": "The Dark Brotherhood is a guild of assassins who are willing to assassinate anyone (apart from members of the guild) as long as the contractor pays enough for their service.\nThey are a perverted offshoot of the \"legal\" assassins &lt;a href=\"Factions%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;guild&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"Morag%20Tong\"&gt;Morag Tong&lt;/a&gt;, who are primarily based in the province of &lt;a href=\"Morrowind\"&gt;Morrowind&lt;/a&gt;; while the Morag Tong was a respected, if feared, organization of Morrowind society, the Dark Brotherhood are a secretive underground cult that worships &lt;a href=\"Sithis\"&gt;Sithis&lt;/a&gt;, the avatar of destruction and the Void.\nRecruitment.\nWhen a person commits murder, it is likely that the Night Mother has been watching from the shadows. The next time the murderer sleeps in a location deemed to be secure, a Speaker will approach the murderer and ask them to join the Dark Brotherhood, and if the offer is accepted, the murderer will then be given a specific target to kill.\nSecondly, when an Argonian from Black Marsh is born under the sign of the Shadow, they are trained by an order known as the \"Shadowscales,\" and pending the end of their training, transferred to the Dark Brotherhood. Additionally, the Dark Brotherhood has been known to recruit through proxy. When a spate of murders is committed in cold blood and without an arrest, the Brotherhood instigates an investigation to recruit the killer.\nUsually the serial killings must only go on so long as it takes the Brotherhood to discover the identity of the killer, at which point they dispatch a courier with a letter requesting the murder of a specific person. Once this murder has been carried out, another letter is dispatched requesting the secret murder (\"i.e. a murder which is untraceable\") of another specific person. If this is accomplished to satisfaction, the Dark Brotherhood dispatches a third courier to provide contact information.\nHow to join.\nThe first time the &lt;a href=\"Hero%20of%20Kvatch\"&gt;Hero of Kvatch&lt;/a&gt; kills any innocent (non-quest related or hostile) character, a message will be displayed stating that \"Your killing has been observed by forces unknown...\"\nThe next time The Hero of Kvatch sleeps in a safe place, &lt;a href=\"Lucien%20Lachance%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;Lucien Lachance&lt;/a&gt;, a Speaker for the Black Hand, will visit them and give the quest \"&lt;a href=\"A%20Knife%20in%20the%20Dark\"&gt;A Knife in the Dark&lt;/a&gt;\" as well as the &lt;a href=\"Blade%20of%20Woe%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;Blade of Woe&lt;/a&gt;. At this point, the Hero is tasked with the killing of an angry old man known as &lt;a href=\"Rufio\"&gt;Rufio&lt;/a&gt;, who lives in the &lt;a href=\"Inn%20of%20Ill%20Omen\"&gt;Inn of Ill Omen&lt;/a&gt;.\nOnce &lt;a href=\"Rufio\"&gt;Rufio&lt;/a&gt; is dead, the Hero must sleep and Lucien Lachance will visit them and offer a membership. When killing him, if he is asleep, along with anyone else who sleeps, they can pickpocket him and get more gold than if they just killed him. Also, after they have pickpocketed him, a simple knife to the back will kill him.\nStructure.\n&lt;a href=\"The%20Five%20Tenets\"&gt;The Five Tenets&lt;/a&gt;.\nA member of the Dark Brotherhood must follow 5 rules known as 'The Five Tenets'. If they break one, they will need to defeat \"The Wrath of Sithis\" to return to the Dark Brotherhood. The five tenets are:\nA number of books are found describing these tenets within the sanctuary. Breaking these results in the \"&lt;a href=\"A%20Dark%20Exile\"&gt;A Dark Exile&lt;/a&gt;\" quest being initiated, in order to get back into the Dark Brotherhood.\nA member undertaking the Ritual of Purification is not beholden to any of the Five Tenets, and may violate any of the Tenets without invoking the Wrath of Sithis. This may apply to members holding the ranks of Silencer or above.\nIt should be noted that, within the boundaries of the games' programming, Tenets 1\u20133 are impossible for the player to break. Dishonoring the Night Mother is very ambiguous, and is very difficult to pin-point. The player is never given an option to tell any outside source about the Dark Brotherhood (which appears to only be possible through communication), and if the player declines a quest offered by Vicente or Ocheeva, that superior will humbly accept your desire to not accept the mission, and that mission will be available for you to do for the rest of the game.\nMany members of the Brotherhood are also vampires, and feeding on fellow members is not considered illegal within the guild.\nSithis the Dread Father.\nSithis is referred to as the Dread Father and is the patron being of the Dark Brotherhood. According to the Dark Brotherhood's belief, every soul murdered by a Dark Brother or Sister joins Sithis in \"The Void.\" His bride is the Night Mother who serves as grandmistress of the Dark Brotherhood.\nWhenever a member breaks one of the five tenets of the Dark Brotherhood, a spirit called the Wrath of Sithis will attack that person in his or her sleep. The Dark Brother or Sister must defeat this ghost in order to gain re-admission into the Dark Brotherhood. It is unknown whether this spirit is actually from or related to Sithis, or if it is merely a tool used by the Brotherhood to keep members in line.\nThe actual, literal truth surrounding Sithis is very difficult for the player to interpret, as virtually everything said about Sithis is allegorical. He has been defined as definitely not a god, but rather, something \"else.\" He has been compared to an extremely cold, cloudless midnight, as well as the state of mind involved in the act of cold-blooded murder.\nHe has been associated with &lt;a href=\"Dagoth%20Ur%20%28Character%29\"&gt;Dagoth Ur&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"Morrowind\"&gt;Morrowind&lt;/a&gt;, and an in-game book within the video game describes Sithis as a twisted corruption of the concept of the \"\"void\",\" viewed as peaceful, safe, and holy by the &lt;a href=\"Altmer%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;Altmer&lt;/a&gt;. Due to this high level of ambiguity, it could be postulated that perhaps this is an actual aspect of Sithis. Though he is spoken of as an actual entity, he could, in theory, be merely an anthropomorphic interpretation of unconscious, non-sentient thoughts, emotions, or phenomena, as is the case in certain interpretations of several Hindu deities in the real world.\nHe is also called the \"\"Serpent God of Death\",\" and is associated by some scholars with the constellation of The Serpent. Additionally, some players have noted the similarities between some of his alleged features and the Egyptian demon . It is unknown how or even if Sithis fits in with the religious chaos/order dualism featured throughout .\nIn the in-game book, \"\"The Definitive Guide to Daedra\",\" Sithis is described as the state of Nothingness before the creation of &lt;a href=\"Nirn\"&gt;Nirn&lt;/a&gt;. However, Vincente Valteri, a member of the Dark Brotherhood in the game Oblivion, claims Sithis is 'No Daedra'.\nIn the book \"The Annotated Anuad,\" it describes a series of events in which creation began. Anu and Padomay were the first \"beings,\" being Stasis, and Change respectively. The book is highly allegorical, though it is possible that it may be literal. In it, Anu creates a perfect, unchanging universe. Padomay, seeing this and hating it, attacks Anu. A fight ensues, and the blood spilled by the two mixed and created the Aedra and Daedra.\nAs, the book is quite ambiguous in itself, being more of a children's story book, it is unknown what actually happened to Padomay and Anu, but many believe that Padomay, who represents change, is also Sithis. This would imply that Sithis is not only NOT the \"God of Death\" that the Dark Brotherhood so reveres, but is rather the creator of the life of Tamriel as we know it today. This is backed up by the book \"Sithis,\" found in the official \"Vile Lair\" expansion, which more or less explains that Sithis is the creator of all life. Obviously, this book is a bit biased as it seems to be written by the Brotherhood, but it would seem that this is not far from the truth.\nWhether or not Sithis/Padomay is an actual entity as opposed to a concept is unknown, but he is revered by human kind, whose philosophy generally sticks with the idea that their own life is a gift, because without Padomay, they would never have existed in the first place. The Elves, on the other hand, seem to despise this idea, seeing it instead as an act of sabotage, with Sithis having stolen the immortality that Anu had bestowed upon his perfect creation.\nTo put it simply, Sithis is everything that \"isn't,\" or the void, as it is put in the game itself. To describe him as a being may very well be incorrect, due to his nature. Since all of his primary characteristics seem to be in some sense, antithetical, it may be more useful simply to avoid rigorously dogmatic pronouncements about him, as many of his own followers seem to do.\nRanks within the Brotherhood.\nThe Night Mother.\nAt the real \"head\" of the Dark Brotherhood hierarchy is the Night Mother, an immortal spirit who is revered and worshiped by the Brotherhood. She is only ever met face-to-face in very exceptional circumstances.\nWhen a person prays for the death of another, the Night Mother hears, and passes on the details of the prayer to her Listener. At this point, the Listener informs a Speaker, who then goes to meet the hiring party in order to draw up a contract.\nIt is said that the Night Mother and her five children were the first sacrifices to Sithis many years ago, and that she now guides her Listener through the Statue of the Lucky Old Lady in &lt;a href=\"Bravil%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;Bravil&lt;/a&gt;.\nIn the book \"&lt;a href=\"Fire%20and%20Darkness\"&gt;Fire and Darkness: The Brotherhoods of Death&lt;/a&gt;\", the Night Mother is identified with the Daedra Lord &lt;a href=\"Mephala\"&gt;Mephala&lt;/a&gt;. While in another book titled \"\"&lt;a href=\"Sacred%20Witness\"&gt;Sacred Witness: A True History of the Night Mother&lt;/a&gt;\",\" the Night Mother is identified as a former &lt;a href=\"Thieves%20Guild%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;Thieves Guild&lt;/a&gt; member.\nListener.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Listener\"&gt;Listener&lt;/a&gt;\u00a0is\u00a0the highest rank a member of the Dark Brotherhood may receive, second only to the Night Mother herself. The Night Mother speaks directly to the Listener, informing him/her of the names and locations of those who have prayed to the Night Mother for a murder to be carried out. The Listener then gives these names to a Speaker.\nBeneath the Night Mother are five elite members of the Brotherhood, known as the &lt;a href=\"Black%20Hand\"&gt;Black Hand&lt;/a&gt;. The Black Hand is made up of four Speakers and one Listener, representing the four fingers and the thumb of the Black Hand.\nEach of the Speakers gets his/her personal assassin, known as \"Silencers.\"\nSpeaker.\nWhen a &lt;a href=\"Speaker\"&gt;Speaker&lt;/a&gt; has received a name from the Listener, the Speaker must then seek out that individual to work out the details of the assassination. It is also the responsibility of the Speakers to recruit new members into the Dark Brotherhood.\nSilencer.\nOutside of the Black Hand itself, the rank of &lt;a href=\"Silencer\"&gt;Silencer&lt;/a&gt;\u00a0is virtually unknown by other members. Each Speaker has his or her Silencer, a personal elite assassin employed to carry out the Speaker's personal 'business'. The Silencers represent the \"nail/claw/talon\" of each finger, or Speaker, of the Black Hand.\nOther ranks.\nThere are five known ranks outside of the Black Hand. Upon entering the Dark Brotherhood, the new recruit has the rank of \"Murderer,\" the lowest of the Brotherhood ranks.\nSanctuaries.\nIn &lt;a href=\"Cyrodiil\"&gt;Cyrodiil&lt;/a&gt;, at least four &lt;a href=\"Dark%20Brotherhood%20Sanctuary\"&gt;Dark Brotherhood sanctuaries&lt;/a&gt; (a kind of chapter house and place for members to unwind and gain new orders except for &lt;a href=\"Dead%20Drop%20Orders\"&gt;Dead Drop Orders&lt;/a&gt;) are known to exist in the cities of &lt;a href=\"Cheydinhal%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;Cheydinhal&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Bruma%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;Bruma&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Leyawiin%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;Leyawiin&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Chorrol%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;Chorrol&lt;/a&gt;, however, by the time of Skyrim, 200 years after the events in Cyrodiil, all of the Dark Brotherhood sanctuaries except the Falkreath Sanctuary, and later the Dawnstar Sanctuary, have been eliminated. The Cheydinhal sanctuary is under the leadership of Speaker &lt;a href=\"Lucien%20Lachance%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;Lucien Lachance&lt;/a&gt;. Other people of interest there include:\nQuests.\nSeveral of the Dark Brotherhood quests are unique in that they offer bonus rewards if the quest is completed in a certain way. These generally make the quest more difficult, but at the same time more rewarding. Some bonuses require a certain method of execution (death by stuffed animal head included), while others promote heightened secrecy (such as in the case of a certain skooma addict). Vicente Valtieri (starting with &lt;a href=\"Accidents%20Happen\"&gt;Accidents Happen&lt;/a&gt;) and Ocheeva offer quests with bonus rewards. Given the nature of many of the quests, it is advisable to at least join the the &lt;a href=\"Thieves%20Guild%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;Thieves Guild&lt;/a&gt; first to pay off bounties and make the wayshrine circuit periodically to remove &lt;a href=\"Fame%23Infamy%20points\"&gt;infamy&lt;/a&gt;.\nUnique quest rewards.\nThe following unique rewards can acquired by the Hero during the questline.\nNote: most of these unique rewards have leveled enchantments."}

The Dark Brotherhood is called upon by those who wish to utilize their deadly services through a ritual called \"&lt;a href=\"The%20Black%20Sacrament\"&gt;The Black Sacrament&lt;/a&gt;,\" although to join the organization, one must be contacted directly. They were once the most feared organization in all of &lt;a href=\"Tamriel\"&gt;Tamriel&lt;/a&gt;, but have lost their reputation over time due to the destruction of multiple sanctuaries across Tamriel. At one point, they were governed by &lt;a href=\"The%20Five%20Tenets\"&gt;The Five Tenets&lt;/a&gt;, which set the ground rules for the Brotherhood, but those tenets have long since been abandoned.\nThe Dark Brotherhood has been operating in &lt;a href=\"Tamriel\"&gt;Tamriel&lt;/a&gt; for many Eras, at one time having many clandestine sanctuaries across the Empire. They revere &lt;a href=\"Sithis\"&gt;Sithis&lt;/a&gt;, the avatar of entropy and chaos, as well as the &lt;a href=\"Night%20Mother\"&gt;Night Mother&lt;/a&gt;, who is their spiritual leader.\nHistory.\nThe Dark Brotherhood has been struggling for survival ever since the end of the &lt;a href=\"Third%20Era\"&gt;Third Era&lt;/a&gt;. Due to the events of , the &lt;a href=\"Dark%20Brotherhood%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;Dark Brotherhood&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Cyrodiil\"&gt;Cyrodiil&lt;/a&gt; was crippled. They managed to survive until the &lt;a href=\"Great%20War\"&gt;Great War&lt;/a&gt;, when, one after another, each Brotherhood &lt;a href=\"Dark%20Brotherhood%20Sanctuary\"&gt;Sanctuary&lt;/a&gt; was destroyed. By the end of the war, the Brotherhood was near total destruction once again. &lt;a href=\"Cicero\"&gt;Cicero&lt;/a&gt;, one of two remaining Dark Brotherhood assassins outside of Skyrim\u00a0(the other believed to be a deserter),\u00a0took the Night Mother's corpse from &lt;a href=\"Bravil\"&gt;Bravil&lt;/a&gt; to the last remaining &lt;a href=\"Dark%20Brotherhood%20Sanctuary%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Dark Brotherhood Sanctuary&lt;/a&gt;. In , the Dark Brotherhood has no listener to hear the Night Mother and thus hears about &lt;a href=\"The%20Black%20Sacrament\"&gt;The Black Sacrament&lt;/a&gt; through rumors. This type of life for the Brotherhood continues until the &lt;a href=\"Last%20Dragonborn\"&gt;Dragonborn&lt;/a&gt; joins them.\nDark Brotherhood Requirements.\nAny man or woman may join the Dark Brotherhood. Initiates must display the ability to kill mercilessly, without regret or sorrow. As a result, their ranks include &lt;a href=\"Vampire%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;vampires&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Lycanthropy%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;werewolves&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Bandits%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;bandits&lt;/a&gt;, and\u00a0&lt;a href=\"Mage%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;mages&lt;/a&gt;.\nA high &lt;a href=\"Sneak%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Sneak&lt;/a&gt; skill is recommended before joining the Dark Brotherhood. Jobs done for them often require stealth, to kill an enemy without being detected. A very useful &lt;a href=\"Perks%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;perk&lt;/a&gt; for this is either &lt;a href=\"Assassin%27s%20Blade%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Assassin's Blade&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"Sneak%20%28Skyrim%29%23Perks\"&gt;Backstab&lt;/a&gt;. To get this, the Dragonborn must have level 50 Sneak (along with the other perks leading up to it). It will allow successful sneak attacks with daggers to do 15 times normal damage.\nUsing stealth, however, is not the only way to assassinate a target without being noticed or given a &lt;a href=\"Bounty%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;bounty&lt;/a&gt;. One can use both &lt;a href=\"Destruction%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Destruction&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Illusion%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Illusion&lt;/a&gt; magic to take down targets. To do this, one has to have the &lt;a href=\"Quiet%20Casting\"&gt;Quiet Casting&lt;/a&gt; perk, and at least a &lt;a href=\"Firebolt%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Firebolt&lt;/a&gt;/&lt;a href=\"Lightning%20Bolt%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Lightning Bolt&lt;/a&gt;/&lt;a href=\"Ice%20Spike%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Ice Spike&lt;/a&gt; spell in the Destruction school. With these requirements, while in stealth mode, one can fire a spell at a target to kill them, without receiving a bounty. An alternative way for mages to use magic to kill a target, is, while in stealth mode, cast a &lt;a href=\"Fury%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Fury&lt;/a&gt; spell at one's target in a public place; this way, characters in-game will kill the target and thus no bounty will be received. Also, if the Dragonborn is a werewolf, they can transform, putting themselves into an unidentifiable state; this way, they can kill their target without getting a bounty, but they must transform without being noticed.\nAttracting the Dark Brotherhood's attention.\nThe Dragonborn can go to any inn and ask for the latest gossip from the innkeeper. The innkeeper may tell the Dragonborn that &lt;a href=\"Aventus%20Aretino\"&gt;Aventus Aretino&lt;/a&gt; is trying to perform the Black Sacrament in &lt;a href=\"Windhelm%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Windhelm&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe children in the &lt;a href=\"Honorhall%20Orphanage\"&gt;Honorhall Orphanage&lt;/a&gt;\u00a0in &lt;a href=\"Riften%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Riften&lt;/a&gt; will also speak about Aventus' attempts to summon the Dark Brotherhood, which will give the Dragonborn a miscellaneous objective as well. Upon speaking to the children there, they will tell the Dragonborn that Aventus Aretino escaped and\u00a0has\u00a0plans to kill their headmistress, &lt;a href=\"Grelod%20the%20Kind\"&gt;Grelod the Kind&lt;/a&gt;, by summoning the Dark Brotherhood.\nAlternatively, if in Riften, the Dragonborn can speak to a man named &lt;a href=\"Maul\"&gt;Maul&lt;/a&gt;. He can usually be found standing against a post off to the left at the entrance of the city. If &lt;a href=\"Maven%20Black-Briar\"&gt;Maven Black-Briar&lt;/a&gt; is Jarl, he will be in Mistveil Keep as her housecarl. After sharing some tough words, he can give information on the Dark Brotherhood - for a price, of course. With a successful &lt;a href=\"Speech\"&gt;intimidation or persuasion&lt;/a&gt;, or upon being shown an &lt;a href=\"unusual%20gem\"&gt;unusual gem&lt;/a&gt;, Maul's information is free.\nSpeaking with &lt;a href=\"Aventus%20Aretino\"&gt;Aventus Aretino&lt;/a&gt;\u00a0in his parent's home in Windhelm initiates the quest \"&lt;a href=\"Innocence%20Lost\"&gt;Innocence Lost&lt;/a&gt;\" and starts the Dark Brotherhood questline. After accepting Aretino's proposal, the Dragonborn is directed to visit Honorhall Orphanage. After killing Grelod, the children will cheer and celebrate her death. No bounty is issued for her death.\nJoining or destroying the Brotherhood.\nTwenty-four hours after Innocence Lost has been completed, a courier will appear to the Dragonborn in any city, with a note saying, \"We know.\" A black hand-print is above the words. After receiving the note, sleeping in any bed for any amount of time will begin the next phase of the quest (the acquisition of this note is optional). While sleeping, the Dragonborn is abducted by a Dark Brotherhood assassin and wakes up in an &lt;a href=\"Abandoned%20Shack%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Abandoned Shack&lt;/a&gt;. This is where the decision to join or destroy the Dark Brotherhood must be made.\nThere, the Dragonborn is asked by &lt;a href=\"Astrid%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Astrid&lt;/a&gt;, the Dark Brotherhood assassin, to kill one of three people in the room, initiating the quest \"&lt;a href=\"With%20Friends%20Like%20These...\"&gt;With Friends Like These...&lt;/a&gt;.\" Killing one, two, or even all of the potential victims will earn the Dragonborn an invitation to join the Dark Brotherhood. The Dragonborn may also take the opportunity to destroy the organization by attacking Astrid. This will initiate the quest \"&lt;a href=\"Destroy%20the%20Dark%20Brotherhood%21\"&gt;Destroy the Dark Brotherhood!&lt;/a&gt;.\" Note that this is the only chance to destroy the Dark Brotherhood, because after joining, the Brotherhood members are otherwise unable to be killed, without the use of &lt;a href=\"Console%20Commands%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;console commands&lt;/a&gt;.\nApparel.\nWhen completing quests in the Dark Brotherhood, the Dragonborn can obtain three armor sets, and three clothing sets.\nDawnstar Sanctuary.\nAstrid.\nAfter &lt;a href=\"Astrid%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Astrid&lt;/a&gt; betrays the brotherhood to &lt;a href=\"Commander%20Maro\"&gt;Commander Maro&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Penitus%20Oculatus%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Penitus Oculatus&lt;/a&gt; during the first assassination attempt against &lt;a href=\"Emperor\"&gt;Emperor&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Titus%20Mede%20II\"&gt;Titus Mede II&lt;/a&gt;, the Penitus Oculatus ravage the Falkreath Sanctuary, killing all but &lt;a href=\"Nazir\"&gt;Nazir&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Babette\"&gt;Babette&lt;/a&gt;. During the attack, the &lt;a href=\"Night%20Mother\"&gt;Night Mother&lt;/a&gt; hides her &lt;a href=\"Listener\"&gt;Listener&lt;/a&gt; within her coffin, to protect them from the invaders and the fires they ignited in the sanctuary. The Listener awakens in the Sanctuary, safe and sound. The Listener then is told by the Night Mother that Astrid is still alive in the temple and must be located. She is burnt badly. She admits to betraying the Brotherhood and hands the Listener the &lt;a href=\"Blade%20of%20Woe%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Blade of Woe&lt;/a&gt;\u00a0with which to kill her.\nRefurnishing the sanctuary.\nNazir sends the Listener to &lt;a href=\"Delvin%20Mallory%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Delvin Mallory&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"The%20Ragged%20Flagon\"&gt;The Ragged Flagon&lt;/a&gt; for assistance with refurbishing the sanctuary. The total upgrade of the sanctuary costs 19,000 . The 20,000 reward given by &lt;a href=\"Amaund%20Motierre\"&gt;Amaund Motierre&lt;/a&gt; for killing the Emperor can cover this entire expense.\nAfterwards, the Listener may report back to Nazir, who effectively serves as a &lt;a href=\"Speaker\"&gt;Speaker&lt;/a&gt; for additional contracts that do not have significance to the faction's storyline. The Night Mother can be approached an unlimited number of times for &lt;a href=\"Dark%20Brotherhood%20Forever\"&gt;more radiant quests&lt;/a&gt;, rewarding 500\u20131200 per assassination. If &lt;a href=\"Cicero\"&gt;Cicero&lt;/a&gt; was spared earlier in the questline, he returns to the sanctuary and becomes available as a &lt;a href=\"Followers%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;follower&lt;/a&gt;.\nAfter every possible upgrade has been purchased for the Sanctuary, &lt;a href=\"Dark%20Brotherhood%20Initiate\"&gt;Dark Brotherhood Initiate&lt;/a&gt;s will be in the Sanctuary. They are available as followers."}

Fennorian thinks these storms can turn people into harrowfiends and mindless harrowed. We need to inform Solitude.\"\nWalkthrough.\nAfter successfully completing \"&lt;a href=\"The%20Gathering%20Storm%20%28Online%29\"&gt;The Gathering Storm&lt;/a&gt;,\" Lyris will brief the Vestige on what steps they will be taking next in their quest to stop the Icereach Coven:\n\"Queen Gerhyld needs to hear what we discovered at Kilkreath Temple. Hopefully, that will be enough for her to get us an audience with High King Svargrim.\"\nAfter which Lyris will promptly depart for Solitude. The Vestige must now make their way to Solitude to join Lyris there in attempting to gain an audience with High King Svargrim. When the Vestige enters the courtyard of the Blue Palace, however, they will immediately be made aware that something terrible has happened by the panicked screams from frightened servants. \nAfter the Vestige makes their way up to the upper floor of the palace the situation becomes apparent: Queen Gerhyld has been assassinated by an unknown assailant. Outraged, High King Svargrim refuses to listen to Lyris' calls for reason:\nHigh King Svargrim: \"Have Jorunn's lackeys come to gloat?\"\nLyris Titanborn: \"We came here to warn you, your highness.\"\nHigh King Svargrim: \"And yet my wife lies dead!\"\nLyris Titanborn: \"If you had listened to us \u2026.\"\nHigh King Svargrim: \"Like she did? If I determine Jorunn had a hand in this, there will be war! Someone take care of my wife!\"\nThe High King will then leave the room, accompanied by &lt;a href=\"Swordthane%20Uthlet\"&gt;Swordthane Uthlet&lt;/a&gt;. Distraught, Lyris speaks to the Vestige:\n\"Gods \u2026 what a disaster. The queen's been assassinated and Svargrim still refuses to listen to reason. We need to find a way to set things right.\"\nNow that Lyris has tasked the Vestige with investigating the scene of the murder, the Vestige must look around the room for any clues indicating how the assassin gained entrance to the palace. A window in the corner of the room appears to have several shards of glass missing, and upon further inspection an Icereach Coven Medallion can be salvaged from the pile of broken glass on the floor in front of it. \nAfter taking the medallion to Lyris, she will note the medallion looks familiar to her; she has seen them before on the &lt;a href=\"Reachmen%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Reachmen&lt;/a&gt; near &lt;a href=\"Kilkreath%20Temple\"&gt;Kilkreath Temple&lt;/a&gt; and on the witches in &lt;a href=\"Icereach\"&gt;Icereach&lt;/a&gt;. Now that they have a clear indication the assassin is in league with the Coven, Lyris asks the Vestige to join her in confronting the High King with some hard truths:\n\"Does Jorunn think me so weak that he believes his half-giant can twist my arm and fill my head with lies? I am not so easily duped, outsider.\"\nThe High King refuses to believe the Vestige and Lyris and demands they leave him at once. As Lyris obliges and the Vestige follows her, they will be approached by &lt;a href=\"Svana%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Svana&lt;/a&gt; as they exit Svargrim's chambers:\n\"My mother \u2026 she told me she gave the mighty Lyris Titanborn an important task. Tell me. What were you doing for my mother?\"\nNow that princess Svana wants them to keep looking into the threat to Western Skyrim, the Vestige must look around Solitude for anyone who might have seen the assassin. The first person they will encounter is &lt;a href=\"Tysvald\"&gt;Tysvald&lt;/a&gt;, leaned over the corpse of his wife. He will explain that during the commotion at the palace, while everyone was heading that way, one man headed in the opposite direction. He describes him as wearing an eye-patch, covering a bestial face. The man dragged Tysvald's wife along, then tossed her aside. He notes the assassin ran towards the Hall of the Dead without batting an eye. \nWhen the Vestige arrives at the Hall of the Dead, they will find &lt;a href=\"High%20Priest%20Ingurt\"&gt;High Priest Ingurt&lt;/a&gt; praying over the bodies of two dead townsmen. He will tell the Vestige the following:\n\"Will you pray with me for these poor souls? Cut down and bound for the Hall of the Dead much too soon.\"\nAt the main gate of the city, the Vestige will once again encounter &lt;a href=\"Shield-Corporal%20Thjol\"&gt;Shield-Corporal Thjol&lt;/a&gt; bent over the body of a fallen city guard. He is still wary of the Vestige, as becomes apparent when they speak to him:\n\"You again? Didn't I warn you about putting your nose where it doesn't belong?\"\n \nLyris will meet the Vestige at the city gate to discuss their findings. After explaining the situation to her, Lyris proposes to fight fire with fire: As the assassin was a vampire, she suggests they get Fennorian involved to assist them in hunting the assassin. The last time they spoke, Fennorian told the Vestige he would seek out a local clever woman to stay with for the time being. \nAs promised, Fennorian can be found southeast of the city in the marshy swamps surrounding the countryside alongside &lt;a href=\"Old%20Mjolen\"&gt;Old Mjolen&lt;/a&gt;, a clever woman. \nFennorian welcomes the Vestige to his remote corner of the world, and tells them the following:\n\"Welcome to the middle of nowhere, my friend. You must be freezing. Warm yourself by the fire and tell me how your audience with the high king went.\"\nAn eccentric woman, Old Mjolen has the following to say to the Vestige:\n\"Local wisdom dictates that only the very brave or the very foolish seek the counsel of vampires and old crones. Which are you, I wonder? Well, out with it. What can Old Mjolen do for you?\"\nFor Old Mjolen to cast the spell that will direct the Vestige towards the owner of the medallion, she will need deathbell and wolf bones. The Vestige will have to travel east of the camp, where they will find said deathbell underneath a tree. It is, however, guarded by two &lt;a href=\"Great%20Bear\"&gt;Great Bear&lt;/a&gt;s who will have to be defeated before the deathbell can be acquired. The wolf bones are located due south, on a sandbank of a small riverbed. Once both items are acquired, the Vestige must return to Old Mjolen so she can cast the divination spell. \nAfter Old Mjolen has enchanted the medallion, the Vestige can now use it to track down the assassin. Using the medallion will show the Vestige a vision of a vampire in a small camp. The magic indicates they should go west to find it.\nAfter discussing the ritual with Fennorian, he agrees to follow the Vestige on his journey west. Once they arrive at the camp, a backpack containing a tattered cloak can be discovered leaning against a tree. The cloak has seen better days and contains several glass fragments, surely it belonged to the eye-patched assassin. On the other end of the tree is one of the vampire's recent victims. Using the enchanted medallion again shows a cave west of the camp. Fennorian has the following to say about it:\n\"Is it wrong to find these visions so intriguing? This one showed your assassin again, eye patch and all, by a cave near a waterfall. And the ball of magicka drifted toward the west again. I suggest we go that way as quickly as possible.\"\nFollowing this, the Vestige must head over to &lt;a href=\"Chillwind%20Depths%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Chillwind Depths&lt;/a&gt;, the cave the medallion showed in its vision. After entering the &lt;a href=\"delve\"&gt;delve&lt;/a&gt;, Fennorian will appear and quickly casts an invisibility spell to swiftly sneak past the hostile creatures within."}

Now they roam the area, attacking the living.Selgaard Wood-Hewer asked me to make sure his brother, cousin, and wife are all right. He thinks they've barricaded themselves in the logging cabins along Bonestrewn Crest. With luck, the draugr haven't gotten to them yet.\"\nWalkthrough.\nWhile roaming the road near Bonestrewn Crest, the Vestige will eventually come across a troubled &lt;a href=\"Nords%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Nord&lt;/a&gt;, standing by himself near the many lakes in the area. When the Vestige initiates dialogue with him, he will tell them the following:\n\"The dead emerged from Bonestrewn Barrow. I was working when it started. I buried my axe in three of them, but they kept on coming. My family's still out there and the countryside is crawling with those damn creatures!\"\nAfterwhich the quest will begin. The Vestige will have to locate Selgaard's wife Jakild, his brother Kerthor and his cousin Agnedir. To locate them, the Vestige will have to follow the three questmarkers, each on one of the three logging cabins owned by the Wood-Hewer family.\nThe closest cabin is the one owned by Agnedir. The Vestige will have to enter the cabin through the cabin window. Once inside, they will see Agnedir's lifeless body lying on the floor. She was killed by draugr. After leaving the cabin, the Vestige will have to proceed towards Jakild's cabin. This cabin must also be entered through a window. When entered, Jakild will be standing near the cabin's fireplace. When spoken to, she will say the following:\n\"You're walking, but you're not dead. You picked the wrong day to visit our camp, stranger.\"\nAfter the conversation, the Vestige will have to reach the final cabin; Kerthor's cabin. This cabin must, again, be entered through the window. Inside is a draugr, feasting on Kerthor's corpse. Once the Vestige has killed the draugr, they must examine the body to come to the conclusion that Kerthor has been murdered by the draugr. After having located all of Selgaard's family members, the Vestige must return to him and speak to him. After having told Selgaar that his wife is the only survivor of the draugr attack, he will tell the Vestige about several \"mysterious travelers\" he recently sheltered. He will say the following about them:\n\"They seemed friendly enough, and we never turn away those in need. But they asked the oddest questions about Bonestrewn Barrow. They were much too interested in that old crypt!\"\nAfter this, the Vestige is tasked with locating the Mysterious Travelers Selgraad spoke of. They will have to enter the barrow, and find the Covenant Expedition. Throughout the entire barrow are large numbers of &lt;a href=\"Skeever%20%28Online%29\"&gt;skeevers&lt;/a&gt; and draugr. The Vestige can find the Covenant Expedition relatively easy by simply following the designated pathways through the barrow. Once they have a reached a large open room, they must read \"&lt;a href=\"Henri%27s%20Journal\"&gt;Henri's Journal&lt;/a&gt;\", which speaks of a camp set up by the Covenant members deep inside the barrow. The Vestige must find this camp, which easily be located by simply following the path deeper into the barrow.\nAfter having reached the camp, the Vestige must read \"&lt;a href=\"Ophelia%27s%20Journal\"&gt;Ophelia's Journal&lt;/a&gt;\", which describes the location of a key that opens the door to the next chamber; the journal. After closing the journal, the Vestige will immediately be attacked by an &lt;a href=\"Undead%20%28Online%29\"&gt;undead&lt;/a&gt; Ophelia. After having defeated her, the Vestige must use the key they found inside the journal to unlock the doors. In the next chamber is large cage containing Owen Pavelle. When the Vestige speaks to him, he will say the following:\n\"Please, get me out of here!\"\nAfter having thrown the switch, Owen will thank the Vestige and proceed to leave the barrow. The switch the Vestige pulled opened the doors to the final chamber of the barrow; the ceremonial chamber. Inside this chamber, the Vestige must confront the necromancer Valcent and defeat him. It is important to note that Valcent will have two draugr protecting him, which can prove to be quite a challenge when simultaneously attacked by them. After defeating Valcent, the Vestige must exist the barrow and speak to Selgaard, who will tell them the following:\n\"I returned to Jakild after you went to the Barrow. We've been hiding in here. Did you find those Covenant milk-drinkers? Did you stop them?\"\nUpon which the Vestige will receive their reward, and the quest will be completed."}

Doesn't matter where I go. I could be hauling rope in &lt;a href=\"Wayrest%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Wayrest&lt;/a&gt; or laying bricks in &lt;a href=\"Bergama%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Bergama&lt;/a&gt;. Wherever I travel, I hear it. \"Savage.\" \"Brute.\" \"Beast.\" It used to really tear me up. I'd look at my reflection in a bowl of water or a shop window and think \"you know, maybe they're right.\" But not anymore. Not since I moved to &lt;a href=\"Vvardenfell%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Vvardenfell&lt;/a&gt;.\nYou want to get a good look at what \"savage\" really means? Come spend some time with the &lt;a href=\"Dunmer%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Dark Elves&lt;/a&gt;. Sure, they clean up well. Everything here is clean and polished and pressed. But if you pull back the curtain even a little, you'll see evil. And I don't mean a clumsy, childish evil. I'm talking about real evil\u2014lusty, red-eyed, and smiling like a &lt;a href=\"Daedra%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Daedra&lt;/a&gt;. Enslavement, murder, deception, cruelty\u2014name a sin and you'll find it venerated. Name a Daedra and you'll find it worshiped. This island is corrupt, straight down to the marrow. Don't believe me? All right, let's talk about bugs.\nVvardenfell is crawling with insects\u2014some as small as a babe's toenail, and some as big as mammoths. That alone wouldn't be cause for concern. I mean, the &lt;a href=\"echatere\"&gt;echatere&lt;/a&gt; back home give some folks the creeps. Most of these critters are hard to look at. But the real horror doesn't come from the bugs themselves. It comes from what the Dark Elves do to them.\nTake the &lt;a href=\"Nix-Ox%20%28Online%29\"&gt;nix-ox&lt;/a&gt;. Never seen one? Picture a flea the size of a horse, propped up on six hairy stilts. Got it? That's a nix-ox.\nFar as I can tell, they're gentle creatures. They don't bleat or grunt like other pack animals. They just wander about, grazing on hardened mushrooms\u2014cracking them open with their great big mandibles and lapping up the fungus inside the husk. Gentle giants, they are. Too gentle, I think.\nEarly in the morning, while the beasts are still dozing, six or seven Dark Elves will descend upon the herd like a pack of greedy &lt;a href=\"welwa\"&gt;welwa&lt;/a&gt;s. It doesn't take long for them to goad a dozen or so nixes into wheeled ox-pens. The leader of the crew will take a quick survey of the catch and mark their chitin with black chalk. Prices, you see? Of course, some don't get marked. Some are too frail or two small to be of use. Rather than letting the creatures go, one of the wranglers will jab them with a spear. Right beneath the chin, see? Then they kick them out of the pens and leave them to rot. The sad thing is that these are the lucky ones.\nNix-oxen that make it to market are divided into two groups: Nix-Tovo, and Nix-Rima. Tovo oxen tend to be older and larger. You can snatch up two or three for the price of a single Rima. For the longest time, I couldn't figure out why. I finally asked one of the wranglers to explain why larger, stronger nix-oxen are so much cheaper.\n\"Hide's too thick,\" he said. \"Can't pry it.\"\nYou see, an older nix's chitin is thick as oak bark. It cracks under pressure. Younger nixes' hides, however, are more pliable. With a bit of pressure, you can separate the plates to see the organs underneath. This access is what makes Rima oxen so valuable.\nWealthier farmers hire specialists called drenlyns to \"train\" their nix-oxen. It's a softer way of saying \"break.\" The drenlyn bores into the poor beast's back with an obsidian drill, and pries open the flesh to expose a bundle of nerves resting in a cavity they call the \"drive chamber.\" They set a few hook-like prods into the viscera, and then reset the plates. It takes the better part of an hour, but by the end, the ox is docile as a lamb. It just stands there. No restless pacing, no nervous twitching of the mandibles. Not alive, not dead... just a husk.\nI won't lie, it's hard to watch. But you know what the scariest part is? The scariest part is how bored everyone looks. I looked into one of those drenlyn's eyes as he pried a nix-ox's back apart, and you know what I saw? The same face my daughter makes when she milks an echatere. A weary, disinterested, nothing-face. Totally oblivious. Immune to shame.\nI'll admit, I'm no green-child. I'll polish off a rack of spare ribs and wash it down with pig-gin without batting an eye. But digging around inside a beast's brains? Turning it into a &lt;a href=\"Zombie%20%28Online%29\"&gt;zombie&lt;/a&gt;? It takes a black heart to do something like that. And you know what? Dark Elves do it all the time."}

She asked me to find all three and destroy them in a shrine on Khenarthi's Roost.\"\nWalkthrough.\nAfter talking to &lt;a href=\"Cartirinque\"&gt;Cartirinque&lt;/a&gt;, the Vestige must find three cursed tomes. One is located right next to her, while the other two are close to &lt;a href=\"Mistral\"&gt;Mistral&lt;/a&gt;. After this, the Vestige must find the ruined shrine.\nUnseen Voice: \"Don't believe her lies.\"\nUnseen Voice: \"Pain lies ahead. Turn back, master. This is not the place for us.\"\nWhen they go to the shrine to burn the books, they meet a &lt;a href=\"Khajiit%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Khajiit&lt;/a&gt; named &lt;a href=\"Sahira-daro\"&gt;Sahira-daro&lt;/a&gt; who is looking for the books, too. She believes they hold great knowledge, and Cartirinque is a test to stop lazy seekers. Cartirinque will appear and tell the Vestige to ignore Sahira-daro. The Vestige can choose to give her the books, or to go along with the original plan and burn them.\nShrine Brazier: \"&lt;You lift the books toward the fire, but your hand freezes in place. You feel a prickling shoot across your skin. A faint pain blossoms in the back of your head.&gt;\"\nUnseen Voice: \"Master, no! The flames burn us! It hurts, it hurts!\"\nBoth options give the same reward. However, choosing to give the books to Sahira will result in her death.\nIf you speak to Sahira-daro before turning in the quest but after burning the books:\n \"Ah, well. Sahira-daro bears no grudge, and wishes you luck in your endeavors. Provided they involve no more burning of books.\""}

Completely round and pulsing with dark energy, the Orb was a powerful tool in sustaining Umaril's army within his fortress of &lt;a href=\"Garlas%20Malatar%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;Garlas Malatar&lt;/a&gt;. Contained on the Ceysel level of that place, the Orb somehow allowed the Aurorans under Umaril's command to return to life immediately after being killed, whereas their spirits would normally have to be revived within the Realm of their &lt;a href=\"Daedric%20Prince\"&gt;Daedric Prince&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Meridia\"&gt;Meridia&lt;/a&gt;. Due to this distinction, it is highly plausible that the Orb was Daedric in nature, perhaps a gift from Meridia herself to Umaril.\nBackground.\nThe overall purpose of the Orb is unknown, but it did prove its worth during the &lt;a href=\"Battle%20of%20Garlas%20Malatar\"&gt;Battle of Garlas Malatar&lt;/a&gt;, where the &lt;a href=\"Knights%20of%20the%20Nine%20%28Faction%29\"&gt;Knights of the Nine&lt;/a&gt;, under the command of the &lt;a href=\"Hero%20of%20Kvatch\"&gt;Hero of Kvatch&lt;/a&gt;, attacked Umaril's stronghold in an effort to stop the Crisis. When battling Aurorans on the Ceysel level, the Knights experienced the power of the Orb as every Auroran they cut down rose seconds later to fight on. Finding the source of the Aurorans' power, the Hero ascended to the Orb's resting place, where he fought and killed the &lt;a href=\"Orb%20Guardian\"&gt;Orb Guardian&lt;/a&gt;. The Hero then destroyed the Dark Orb, shattering it and releasing its power. When the Orb was broken, time stopped in Ceysel, and both the Aurorans and Knights vanished. The broken pieces of the Orb hung suspended in the air, leaving the Hero alone to continue on to Umaril's throne room. While these were the immediate effects of the Orb, it is unknown what exactly it was, or what its purpose truly was."}

Astara wants to find out what the Count knows.\"\nWalkthrough.\nAfter completing \"&lt;a href=\"A%20Special%20Request\"&gt;A Special Request&lt;/a&gt;,\" Astara will have a new task for you. You are to meet with Count Carolus Aquilarios in &lt;a href=\"Dasek%20Moor%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Dasek Moor&lt;/a&gt; and discover what he knows about the recent murders. Before you leave though, Astara will ask you to speak with Mirabelle Motierre about the count. \nMirabelle can be found in the same room as Astara. She will tell you what she knows about the Count, Dasek Moor, and &lt;a href=\"The%20Black%20Dragon\"&gt;The Black Dragon&lt;/a&gt;. Dasek Moor is an old fort; the count has a camp there that he occasionally used for unknown purposes. Mirabelle will also tell you that has has been spying on the Black Dragon, though she asks you to not tell Astara about this as Astara would deem it reckless. The Black Dragon also regularly visits Dasek Moor, specifically the &lt;a href=\"Enclave%20of%20the%20Hourglass\"&gt;Enclave of the Hourglass&lt;/a&gt;. You can inform Astara of this spying; if you do so, .\nHead to Dasek Moor south of Kvatch and meet the count there. He will be in a small ruin north of the main ruin. He will tell you that he already told everything to Mirabelle, but he will tell it to you again. The Black Dragon is working for the &lt;a href=\"Order%20of%20the%20Hour%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Order of the Hour&lt;/a&gt;, and they are amassing an army and siege weapons in the Enclave of the Hourglass. They are offering mass pardons to Fortunata's pirates in exchange for them becoming members. The count will tell you that he can no longer keep the Order and &lt;a href=\"Primate%20Artorius\"&gt;Primate Artorius&lt;/a&gt; under control, and will ask you to help with the situation. \nHead south to the Enclave; you will run into Mirabelle at the entrance. She will tell you that she is here to kill the Black Dragon and avenge &lt;a href=\"Cimbar\"&gt;Cimbar&lt;/a&gt;'s death. You can try to dissuade her from going in alone, but you will fail. After the conversation, head in and torch the siege weapons in the courtyard, then head into the enclave proper. You will overhear a conversation where the Order tries to sway a pirate captain to initiate her crew into the Order. Sneak in and kill both &lt;a href=\"Captain%20Marie%20Elena\"&gt;Captain Marie Elena&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Lieutenant%20Vinicius\"&gt;Lieutenant Vinicius&lt;/a&gt;; you can probably only get one of them with te blade of woe. The other will have to be fought the old-fashioned way. \nAfter they are dead, proceed further into the enclave and down the stairs to the Basilica of Eternity. Sneak or fight your way through these hallways until you reach the shrine where the pirates are being initiated, then kill the lot of them, including the chanter. After this, head through the door in the south to the Neglected Vestry, then take a detour to your left to burn the pardon edict. After this, head over to the east side of the tunnels; there is only one path there as all the other routes are blocked. You must head through the center room, then head into the northeast passage that turns south. You will see a wamasu named &lt;a href=\"Waarosh\"&gt;Waarosh&lt;/a&gt; to your left; killing it is optional. \nOnce you reach the square room with the stacks of books, head up the ramp to the top floor. There, you will find an unarmed woman named &lt;a href=\"Lyra%20Viria\"&gt;Lyra&lt;/a&gt;; speak with her and she will tell you that the Black Dragon was once a member of the Dark Brotherhood, but she ended up seeking redemption with the Order. Lyra will offer to bring you to the Black Dragon's chambers; follow her there and have a look around. You will find &lt;a href=\"The%20Black%20Dragon%27s%20Journal\"&gt;The Black Dragon's Journal&lt;/a&gt; on the table here; you will discover that Lyra is in fact the Black Dragon. After you are done reading the book, Mirabelle will show up and tell you she is here waiting for the Black Dragon. Lyra will get her by surprise and kill her. \nAfter this, use the escape tunnel in the Black Dragon's room to leave the dungeon and head back to the sanctuary to tell Astara what happened.

I accept the title they have given me, and wear it proudly as a badge of honor. For the name I now carry shows that I was willing to enter the dark places, over and over again. To brave the ruins of madness and chaos to bring knowledge to the world. &lt;a href=\"Tribunal%20%28Online%29\"&gt;The Three&lt;/a&gt;\u00a0protect me from the things I have discovered, and keep my mind clear long enough to share this knowledge with the world!\nI found my first &lt;a href=\"Daedric%20Ruins%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Daedric ruin&lt;/a&gt; when I was a very young man. It was a hidden shrine from the past, dedicated to the Anticipations of the Tribunal. I was rounding up a number of &lt;a href=\"Kwama%20%28Online%29\"&gt;kwama&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Scrib%20%28Online%29\"&gt;scrib&lt;/a&gt; that had wandered away from the herd. I followed the scribs into a hidden canyon, when I heard the pathetic cry of a lost scrib emerging from a crack in the canyon wall. I squeezed through the narrow gap to find that it opened into a large depression in the rock. But no simple cave had I wandered into. No, this space was full of carved stone that at once filled me with both wonder and deep fear. For the oppressive blocks of set stone were decorated with patterns of webbing and spider motifs, and the statue at the center of the space depicted none other than the Anticipation of &lt;a href=\"Vivec\"&gt;Vivec&lt;/a&gt;, the Webspinner &lt;a href=\"Mephala\"&gt;Mephala&lt;/a&gt;.\nWords carved into the base of the statue burned into my memory, never to be forgotten: \"Lust is love. Lies are truth. Death is life.\" They frightened me, but also excited me. The experience set me on a path that led to madness and knowledge, though where one ends and the other begins, I cannot tell.\nI returned to my family's kwama mine, escorting the scribs back to the herd. Then I packed a bag, said goodbye to my mother, and started my search for the hidden shrines and dark places where the Daedric ruins wait to be discovered.\nNot every ruined shrine waits beneath the ground. Some hide in open places that are far from inhabited lands. These might be overgrown with vegetation or lost within the folds of rolling hills and craggy canyons. I have even visited a shrine that was hidden beneath the sea.\nThose shrines located in underground caves and complexes tend to appear more ominous and oppressive than those happened upon in the great outdoors, but that could just be the influence of the ever-present darkness and awareness of the crushing walls of stone. Some of these ancient shrines stand alone in the darkness, but others serve as the focal points of great complexes, many of which are guarded by elaborate traps or vicious monsters\u2014or both.\nI have visited more than a dozen of these Daedric ruins, and a few were not as abandoned and unused as the Temple would have you believe. There are still those among us who honor and even worship the &lt;a href=\"Daedric%20Princes\"&gt;Daedric Princes&lt;/a&gt;, and I discovered more than a few fresh offerings and sacrifices in these dark places. But the true secret, the knowledge that has earned me my new name? For that, I must ask you to keep an open mind and a firm resolve, because what I am about to reveal may sound unbelievable. It may even sound like the beginning of a campfire story, one intended to frighten before bedtime. But I assure you, this is no story.\nWhat did I find at that first shrine to the Webspinner that I wandered into by luck and accident? What drove me from my parents' home in search of other Daedric ruins? It was the voice. Beautiful and seductive. It whispered to me, told me secrets that I never should have heard. The whispers emanated from the ancient, cracked statue. They echoed from the cavern walls. They reverberated through my mind, building in volume and intensity until they drowned out my own thoughts and memories. They frightened me, these whispers. But they also excited me, and I had to hear more. But the Webspinner was done with me. She imparted her words of wisdom and dark secrets and fell silent. The place was once more abandoned, desolate.\nIf I wanted to hear more\u2014and I so very much wanted to hear more\u2014I would have to find another shrine. And so my life's work was set before me. I had to find other secret places, other hidden ruins. I had to hear what the other Daedra had to say. Not because I worship them. Not because I had fallen under some dark spell. No, I needed to learn more so that I could share it with the world. It was imperative! It was my duty! But, as I write these words, I find that I can't reveal what the whispers told me. My hand won't put the whispers to paper. It refuses no matter how hard I try!\nIt seems I have failed in my mission. All I can do is tell you that there are secrets to learn. But it appears that if you want to learn them, you'll have to make the trip yourself. Visit the dark ruins, listen to the whispers. Perhaps you'll fare better than I, and the whispers won't drive you mad."}

They are sworn rivals of the Golden Saints and sometimes even clash at the sight of each other.\nCulture.\nMales in Dark Seducer society, just like the Golden Saints, are often looked down upon, and even the males view themselves as lesser than the females. The origin of this practice is unknown. In terms of beliefs, nothing is more sacred then the Wellspring of the Mazken. This well revives dead Mazken.\nCombat.\nIn battle, Dark Seducers fight with a variety of weapons such as axes and swords, and are able to use some destruction spells."}

The hoarvor uses its legs and body to pin down its prey, while their spiral-bladed mouth tears into the victim's chest. Before a hoarvor dies, it releases its prey, shivers once, then expels a burst of yellow bile.\nHoarvors are particularly notorious in the &lt;a href=\"Western%20Cross\"&gt;Western Cross&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"Falinesti%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Falinesti&lt;/a&gt;, where they feed on and kill drunkards who have fallen asleep (most likely from drinking &lt;a href=\"Jagga\"&gt;Jagga&lt;/a&gt;).

There is a lighthouse, &lt;a href=\"Frostflow%20Lighthouse\"&gt;Frostflow Lighthouse&lt;/a&gt;, to the south of the cave. Hob's Fall Cave is inhabited by &lt;a href=\"Necromancer%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Necromancers&lt;/a&gt;.\nWalkthrough.\nUpon entering the cave, the &lt;a href=\"Last%20Dragonborn\"&gt;Dragonborn&lt;/a&gt; will find themselves in an icy cavern. Turn right (north) and head down the slope, turning right again (northeast) into a large open space. Walk down and turn left (west) and go down another snowy pathway. Following this path, there will be a &lt;a href=\"Skeleton%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;skeleton&lt;/a&gt; to battle. After picking off the skeleton, walk a few more steps to where a leveled necromancer waits at a table in a lit space. After killing him, loot the various &lt;a href=\"Soul%20Gem%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;soul gems&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Potions%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;potions&lt;/a&gt; on his table and shelf, then loot the chest next to his chair. Continue on down another slope.\nThe Dragonborn will come to a small lit space with a skeleton and a &lt;a href=\"Necromage%20%28Character%29\"&gt;necromage&lt;/a&gt; to deal with. When they are dead, head further down the path. It should slope upward, and turn right (east) to a wooden bridge. Kill the leveled necromancer here. She will be accompanied by a skeleton, and fighting them will alert another necromancer just down the path. If sneak skills are used, they can be taken out silently without alarm. If it comes to fighting, a couple more will be alerted.\nThese ones will be in a large, furnished space. Once all the necromancers are dead, loot the apprentice-locked chest along the north wall. Also check the shelf to the right of this chest for some potions, books, and an apothecary's satchel.\nBefore continuing, backtrack to the pathway. Head down the path that goes right (north). Turn a couple times, battling a couple skeletons along the way, and turn left (south) when the path widens. Down the slope, there is a necromage to battle in a small space. In this space is an alchemy lab, some potions, a &lt;a href=\"Stone%20of%20Barenziah\"&gt;Stone of Barenziah&lt;/a&gt;, and an apothecary's satchel. Before going, jump down to the small ledge just above this room (it is fairly evident when climbing the slope) where there is an adept-locked chest. After looting, return to the room with the sacrificial table and the arcane enchanter.\nTo open the gate, there is a pull chain to the right of it. The chain is rusty and somewhat hard to see at first glance. Open the gate and head down the path. The Dragonborn will come to three frost soul gem traps. Remove the soul gems to disable them. After that, there is a lit corner and a necromage patrolling the path. Kill them and continue.\nIn the next large room, there are three necromancers (including the Master Necromancer). When they are dead, loot the boss chest behind the Master's table and slightly to the left. When the cave is cleared, head left (west) of the Master's table and jump down through the wooden spikes. The Dragonborn will be back at the entrance to the cave. Now they can deal with any quest items.\nWith the installed, the unique loot container Ancient Tome Chest will spawn in the room with the arcane enchanter by the bookcases, containing 16 new spell tomes from the Creation Club. \nTrivia.\nNecromancer 1: \"\"We offer this soul to &lt;a href=\"Mannimarco\"&gt;The Revenant&lt;/a&gt;: he who watches over the opponents of &lt;a href=\"Arkay\"&gt;Arkay&lt;/a&gt; and his power over life and death. Fie upon Arkay and his followers. Fie!\"\"\nNecromancer 2: [unenthusiastic] \"Yeah, fie.\"\"\nNecromancer 1: \"\"Fie. We beseech you.

He hates being cheated out of money, which has caused him issue with &lt;a href=\"Degaine\"&gt;Degaine&lt;/a&gt;'s begging and when people turn down his food. Similarly, he dislikes both sides of the &lt;a href=\"Skyrim%20Civil%20War\"&gt;Skyrim Civil War&lt;/a&gt;, as both the &lt;a href=\"Stormcloaks\"&gt;Stormcloaks&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Imperial%20Legion%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Imperials&lt;/a&gt; expect compensation. He additionally has a strange fixation on blood and meat, which tends to be a source of discomfort for those around him. Hogni is actually a cannibal, which perhaps explain why he is obsessed with blood. When not at his stall in the market, he tends to keep to himself, taking the largest room in the &lt;a href=\"Silver-Blood%20Inn\"&gt;Silver-Blood Inn&lt;/a&gt; so he has more space. \nLike most Nords in the Reach, he detests the &lt;a href=\"Forsworn\"&gt;Forsworn&lt;/a&gt;, believing that they are nothing but trouble.\nInteractions.\nIf asked about the source of his meat, he reveals the location of &lt;a href=\"Dushnikh%20Yal\"&gt;Dushnikh Yal&lt;/a&gt;, an &lt;a href=\"Orc%20Stronghold\"&gt;Orc Stronghold&lt;/a&gt; where he gets his supplies.\n&lt;a href=\"The%20Forsworn%20Conspiracy\"&gt;The Forsworn Conspiracy&lt;/a&gt;.\nWhen first arriving in Markarth, &lt;a href=\"Weylin\"&gt;Weylin&lt;/a&gt; is seen speaking to Hogni before then drawing his dagger to make his move on &lt;a href=\"Margret\"&gt;Margret&lt;/a&gt;. Following this, the &lt;a href=\"Last%20Dragonborn\"&gt;Dragonborn&lt;/a&gt; can ask Hogni about what happened, to which he will mention that Weylin was clearly a Forsworn sympathizer. Like &lt;a href=\"Kerah\"&gt;Kerah&lt;/a&gt;, he will refuse to sell anything due to the event.\n&lt;a href=\"The%20Taste%20of%20Death\"&gt;The Taste of Death&lt;/a&gt;.\nDuring the Daedric quest \"&lt;a href=\"The%20Taste%20of%20Death\"&gt;The Taste of Death&lt;/a&gt;,\" it is revealed that he, along with a few other citizens of &lt;a href=\"Markarth%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Markarth&lt;/a&gt;, is a &lt;a href=\"cannibal\"&gt;cannibal&lt;/a&gt;.

The temple is also the home of the &lt;a href=\"Apographa\"&gt;Apographa&lt;/a&gt;, an ancient text that is hidden from the populous.\nDescription.\nGeography.\nThe Island of Holamayan is located on the southeastern end of Azura's Coast, towards the &lt;a href=\"Molag%20Amur\"&gt;Molag Amur&lt;/a&gt; region. The island itself is a large hill that could not normally hold a settlement, but the temple is built on the center of the island, there is a slope that serves as a path connecting Holamayan and the Dockyards. The only other location on the island is the &lt;a href=\"Zalkin%20Grotto\"&gt;Zalkin Grotto&lt;/a&gt;, which holds no significance whatsoever. Holamayan Monastery is a simple temple dedicated to &lt;a href=\"Azura\"&gt;Azura&lt;/a&gt;. Beyond the temple seen outside, some hallways are dug out from the stone surrounding the Temple of Holamayan. The Island of Holamayan itself is located in the Temple District of Vvardenfell, which is a piece of territory that is not occupied by any of the Great Houses, but the &lt;a href=\"Tribunal%20Temple\"&gt;Tribunal Temple&lt;/a&gt;.\nHistory.\n&lt;a href=\"First%20Era\"&gt;First Era&lt;/a&gt;.\nDuring the first era, &lt;a href=\"Indoril%20Nerevar\"&gt;Indoril Nerevar&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"King%20Dumac\"&gt;King Dumac&lt;/a&gt; had created the &lt;a href=\"First%20Council\"&gt;First Council&lt;/a&gt;, an alliance between the &lt;a href=\"Chimer\"&gt;Chimer&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Dwarves\"&gt;Dwarves&lt;/a&gt;. While the &lt;a href=\"Tribunal\"&gt;Tribunal&lt;/a&gt; warned Nerevar to claim &lt;a href=\"Resdayn\"&gt;Resdayn&lt;/a&gt; for himself, he ignores them, visioning a united Resdayn in peace. However, this would change when &lt;a href=\"Dagoth%20Ur%20%28Character%29\"&gt;Dagoth Ur&lt;/a&gt; arrived to meet with Nerevar, revealing to him the information about the &lt;a href=\"Heart%20of%20Lorkhan\"&gt;Heart of Lorkhan&lt;/a&gt;, a legendary artifact that has given the Dwarves immortality and the powers of a God. Ur has even told Nerevar about &lt;a href=\"Numidium\"&gt;Numidium&lt;/a&gt;, the Brass God of the Dwarves. Feeling uncertain, Nerevar made a pilgrimage to the Holamayan Monastery to garner an audience with &lt;a href=\"Azura\"&gt;Azura&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"Daedric%20Prince\"&gt;Daedric Prince&lt;/a&gt; of Dusk and Dawn, who told him the truth. With this news and advisement from the Tribunal, Indoril Nerevar had waged war with the Dwarves, which ended with the &lt;a href=\"Battle%20of%20Red%20Mountain\"&gt;Battle of Red Mountain&lt;/a&gt;. Eventually, Nerevar used the power of &lt;a href=\"Kagrenac%27s%20Tools\"&gt;Kagrenac's Tools&lt;/a&gt; to take the Dwarves immortality, and the Tribunal betrayed Indoril Nerevar to achieve godhood.\n&lt;a href=\"Second%20Era\"&gt;Second Era&lt;/a&gt;.\nDuring the &lt;a href=\"Interregnum\"&gt;Interregnum&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"2E%20583\"&gt;2E 583&lt;/a&gt;, the Holamayan Monastery was isolated from the rest of Dunmeri society, situated in Azura's Coast. With the establishment of the Tribunal Temple, the Dissident Priests of Holamayan opposed the ideals of the Temple and questioned both the Tribunal and Dagoth Ur's ascension into godhood. When they openly opposed the Temple, they were persecuted and forced into hiding at the Holamayan Monastery. Once they heard of the &lt;a href=\"Nerevarine%20Prophecy\"&gt;Nerevarine Prophecy&lt;/a&gt;, they had begun to partake in heavy research and study on the overall topic. To protect themselves, the Dissident Priests created a magical barrier surrounding Holamayan Monastery, which will open up during the dawn and dusk, since these times are linked with Azura, the Patron of the Temple. Holamayan remained closed from the rest of Vvardenfell for quite sometime and the Dissident Priests have remained in hiding.\n&lt;a href=\"Third%20Era\"&gt;Third Era&lt;/a&gt;.\nDuring the outbreak of &lt;a href=\"the%20Blight\"&gt;the Blight&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"3E%20427\"&gt;3E 427&lt;/a&gt;, the Holamayan Monastery was under the de-facto supervision of &lt;a href=\"Gilvas%20Barelo\"&gt;Gilvas Barelo&lt;/a&gt;, the Abbot of Holamayan. There was a Dissident priestess named &lt;a href=\"Mehra%20Milo\"&gt;Mehra Milo&lt;/a&gt; who operated out of &lt;a href=\"Vivec%20City\"&gt;Vivec City&lt;/a&gt; and was in contact with &lt;a href=\"the%20Blades\"&gt;the Blades&lt;/a&gt; in Vvardenfell through an &lt;a href=\"Nerevarine\"&gt;Agent&lt;/a&gt; of the group, who was tasked to investigate the Nerevarine Prophecy. At one point, Milo was captured by the &lt;a href=\"Ordinator\"&gt;Ordinator&lt;/a&gt;s and so the Agent was forced to free her from the &lt;a href=\"Ministry%20of%20Truth\"&gt;Ministry of Truth&lt;/a&gt;. With Mehra Milo secured, the two returned to Holamayan where the Agent was able to obtain notes on the Nerevarine Prophecy and gave it to &lt;a href=\"Nibani%20Maesa\"&gt;Nibani Maesa&lt;/a&gt; at the &lt;a href=\"Urshilaku%20Camp\"&gt;Urshilaku Camp&lt;/a&gt; on the other side of Vvardenfell. From there, the Agent would walk down a path that would name them the true &lt;a href=\"Nerevarine\"&gt;Nerevarine&lt;/a&gt;.\n&lt;a href=\"Fourth%20Era\"&gt;Fourth Era&lt;/a&gt;.\nDuring the &lt;a href=\"Red%20Year\"&gt;Red Year&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"4E%205\"&gt;4E 5&lt;/a&gt;, Holamayan Monastery was destroyed amidst the destruction, but the Dissident Priests had lived on. When the Tribunal disappeared from the province of Morrowind, the Dissident Priests had stepped in, bringing about the &lt;a href=\"New%20Temple\"&gt;New Temple&lt;/a&gt;, a new religion surrounding the Good Daedra of the &lt;a href=\"Dunmeri%20Pantheon\"&gt;Dunmeri Pantheon&lt;/a&gt;. The Dissident Priests had taken over the Tribunal Temple, with Tribunal loyalists being purged or recanted. Despite this, the Great &lt;a href=\"House%20Indoril\"&gt;House Indoril&lt;/a&gt; was still able to attain the status of a &lt;a href=\"Great%20House\"&gt;Great House&lt;/a&gt;, when the Temple priesthood and House Indoril were considered one of the same. Political Power would then fall onto the Temple Priests, yet the old high-ranking members of House Indoril remained in their high-status. It is unknown whatever happened to Holamayan Monastery, but it was either left abandoned, or it was repaired by the relief effort on Vvardenfell."}

Every hold in &lt;a href=\"Skyrim\"&gt;Skyrim&lt;/a&gt; has its own Guard.\nEquipment.\nAll hold guards wear &lt;a href=\"Hold%20Guard%20Armor\"&gt;similar armor sets&lt;/a&gt;; the only differences being the color of the sash and material of the undershirt used, either scaled or quilted. They also wear the same &lt;a href=\"Hold%20Guard%20Helmets\"&gt;type of helmet&lt;/a&gt;, however the colors vary depending on the hold. Hold guards carry a &lt;a href=\"Hold%20Guard%20Shields\"&gt;round wooden shield&lt;/a&gt;, which varies in color and typically displays the symbol of the hold across the front. Weapons carried by the hold guards vary depending on which hold they belong to. All Imperial-controlled holds, save for &lt;a href=\"The%20Reach\"&gt;The Reach&lt;/a&gt;, have their guards armed with &lt;a href=\"Imperial%20Sword\"&gt;Imperial Sword&lt;/a&gt;s and &lt;a href=\"Imperial%20Bow\"&gt;Imperial Bow&lt;/a&gt;s. Reach hold guards vary in wielding one-handed &lt;a href=\"Iron%20Weapons%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;iron&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"Steel%20Weapons%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;steel&lt;/a&gt; weapons, but still use Imperial bows like their counterparts in the other Imperial-controlled holds. However, some Reach hold guards, such as those that patrol the &lt;a href=\"Dwemer%20Museum\"&gt;Dwemer Museum&lt;/a&gt;, are armed with Imperial swords like their counterparts in &lt;a href=\"Haafingar\"&gt;Haafingar&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Hjaalmarch\"&gt;Hjaalmarch&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Whiterun%20Hold\"&gt;Whiterun&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Falkreath%20Hold%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Falkreath&lt;/a&gt;, and the Whiterun hold guard that normally guards the front gate of Whiterun is seen wielding a one or two-handed iron or steel weapon instead of an Imperial sword himself. Hold guards in Stormcloak-controlled holds wield any one-handed or two-handed iron or steel weapons with &lt;a href=\"Hunting%20Bow%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;hunting bows&lt;/a&gt; for their archery weapon, with either a &lt;a href=\"Hide%20Shield\"&gt;Hide Shield&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"Steel%20Shield%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Steel Shield&lt;/a&gt; when engaging in combat instead of their &lt;a href=\"Hold%20Guard%20Shields\"&gt;Hold Guard Shields&lt;/a&gt;. All hold guards use &lt;a href=\"Steel%20Arrow%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;steel arrows&lt;/a&gt; with their bows.\nHierarchy.\nHold guards can be permanently replaced by either Imperial or Stormcloak soldiers during the &lt;a href=\"Skyrim%20Civil%20War\"&gt;civil war&lt;/a&gt; when a hold changes sides,\u00a0depending on which side the &lt;a href=\"Last%20Dragonborn\"&gt;Dragonborn&lt;/a&gt; joins. They will perform the same duties and have the same dialogue (although they may also have additional faction-based dialogue) as regular guards. The victorious faction will keep their guards. However, those that are not loyal will be replaced.\nThe guards are led by a &lt;a href=\"Guard%20Captains\"&gt;captain&lt;/a&gt; and local &lt;a href=\"Imperial%20Legion%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Imperial Legate&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"Stormcloak%20Commander\"&gt;Stormcloak Commander&lt;/a&gt; who reports to the local &lt;a href=\"Jarl\"&gt;Jarl&lt;/a&gt;. Their duty is to uphold peace and order throughout the city and the hold, as well as ensuring justice is upheld in the event of a crime. Additionally, they are the last line of defense of their city in the event of assault or invasion.\nOnly Stormcloak-affiliated Holds have female guards.\nLevel.\nHold Guards have a minimum level of 20, and beyond that level with the Dragonborn until level 50. This means that at level 50+, the Hold Guards are rather powerful, and have no problem fighting even a &lt;a href=\"Dragons%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;dragon&lt;/a&gt;. \nBounties.\nBounties in each hold are treated separately. For example, if the Dragonborn obtains a bounty in Whiterun, guards in neighboring hold Falkreath will not recognize it. If the Dragonborn's bounty reaches a certain level, guards will attack them on sight.\nNormally, all guards can be bribed if the Dragonborn is a member of the &lt;a href=\"Thieves%20Guild%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Thieves Guild&lt;/a&gt;, with the exception of the guards of &lt;a href=\"Markarth%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Markarth&lt;/a&gt; after the completion of &lt;a href=\"The%20Forsworn%20Conspiracy\"&gt;The Forsworn Conspiracy&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"No%20One%20Escapes%20Cidhna%20Mine\"&gt;No One Escapes Cidhna Mine&lt;/a&gt;. These guards will not accept bribes and the Dragonborn has no choice but to fight or go to jail, and after selecting the latter the guard will have dialogue options. Cancel out the conversation and the guard will ignore the Dragonborn.\nIt is possible to kill guards without gaining a bounty, as long as one is &lt;a href=\"Sneak%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;sneaking&lt;/a&gt;. Slain guards will respawn three days after their death. They can also be killed if they are hit by an Unrelenting Force shout and pushed off a cliff, or sometimes even down the stairs. The Dragonborn does not get a bounty unless they have shouted at quite a few guards beforehand.\nDialogue.\n\"What do you think you're doing, walking around dressed like a damn Stormcloak traitor?\"\n\"You've got a lot of nerve, walking around here dressed like an Imperial Legionnaire.\"\n\"I need to ask you to stop. That... shouting... is making people nervous.\"\n\"I can't believe it! You're... Dragonborn...\"\n\"You want in, you need to cooperate.\"\n\"Hold and stand down. If you want to get into Riften, use the North Gate. This one's closed.\"\n\"Hold it there! Keep your distance.\"\nAfter speaking to the witnesses:\nI've spoken to the witnesses. \"Just like always -- nobody saw anything useful. The bastard's escaped again.\"\nAfter finding Hjerim:\nHow do I get into Hjerim? \"Friga Shatter-Shield's old place? It's been abandoned ever since she was killed. I think her mother, Tova, has the key.\"\nAfter investigating Hjerim:\nCan you tell me anything about the \"Butcher\"? \"Uf. Have you been talking to Viola Giardano? She posts those all over the city, and someone keeps taking them down. Ask her about it if you want an earful.\"\nDo you know what this amulet is? \"I've never seen anything like it. I would take this to Calixto at the House of Curiosities. He has a good eye for strange trinkets. Might even give you a bit of gold for it.\"\nAfter another victim is killed:\nWhat happened? Another killing? \"Indeed. I... I thought you captured the Butcher. You said the city was safe, now. How could this have happened?\"\n\"Halt! City's closed with the dragons about. Official business only.\"\n\"If you've come to Solitude to join the Imperial Legion, speak to Rikke. If not, just keep your nose clean while you're here... or you'll end up like Roggvir.\"\n\"There's nothing for you in the warehouse, so why don't you take a walk?\"\n\"First time in Markarth, traveler? Take my advice. You see anything, don't get involved. The city guard will take care of it.\"-\n\"Everyone stay back. The Markarth city guard have this all under control. There are no Forsworn here.\"\n\"We'll handle things from here. Move along.\"\nAfter Eltrys is killed:\n\"We warned you, but you just had to go and cause trouble. Now we have to pin all these recent murders on you. Silence witnesses. Work. Work. Work.\"\n\"Halt. The Dwemer Museum isn't open to anyone without the court wizard's permission.\"\n\"You need something?\"\n\"Don't worry, citizen. I'm on top of that little matter we discussed.\"\n\"I'll soon arrange transportation for our little friend. Don't worry, he'll rot in a cell and pay for what he's done.\"\nAfter Cicero has murdered Loreius and Curwe:\n\"You don't want to go up to that farmhouse, citizen. It's a terrible sight. The farmer and his wife, slaughtered in the night. So many knife wounds...\"\n\"Something to tell the grandkids, eh?\"\n\"Did you see a Dog out there?\"\n\"I guess I'll stay on the lookout. Keep your nose clean while you're here outsider.\"\nConversations.\nWuunferth: \"What is the meaning of this?\"\nJorleif: \"You're under , for the Murder of Susanna of Candlehearth Hall. And Friga Shatter-Shield. And all the rest. We're wise to your scheming, you coward.\"\nWuunferth: \"Has the whole city lost their brains? I've been scrying and auguring to find the murderer myself.\"\nJorleif: \"Make your excuses from the Bloodworks, wizard. Get him out of my sight.\"\nWindhelm Guard: \"Yes, sir! I'm sorry, sir. But you'll have to come with me.\"\nWuunferth: \"This isn't over, Jorleif!\"\nGuard: \"You there! Fool! Hold fast. You've been accused of a crime against the laws of this land. What say you in your defense?\"\nCicero: \"Wh... What? A crime? Me? Preposterous! Poor Cicero is just standing here! Cicero loves order. Oh yes! He would never disrespect the law!\"\nGuard: \"You look like a crazy man to me. And what's in that coffin, hmm? Maybe some time in a cell will help loosen that lying tongue.\"\nCicero: \"Damn that Loreius. Oh, how he will pay for this treachery...\"\nGuard: \"You just keep quiet and stay where you are. Soon as my relief arrives, we'll all take a nice little trip.\"\nMarkarth City Guard: \"What a waste! There must be a dozen men up there!\"\nMarkarth City Guard 2: \"Yeah. Calcelmo called in his entire expedition team - said he needed every man he could get to protect his research.\"\nMarkarth City Guard: \"Better them than us. We lost three good men to the traps up there, and for what- just to see another damn spider clanking around?\"\nMarkarth City Guard 2: \"Well, at least this post is safe enough.

The &lt;a href=\"Bretons%20%28Daggerfall%29\"&gt;Breton&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Redguards%20%28Daggerfall%29\"&gt;Redguard&lt;/a&gt; cultures have many similarities, but just as many distinctions. An analysis of the holidays is one way to study the people. As any schoolchild could tell you, the Redguards are a relatively new culture to &lt;a href=\"Tamriel\"&gt;Tamriel&lt;/a&gt;. Their arrival from their homeland is actually well recorded, though it occured several thousand years ago, in the &lt;a href=\"1E%20808\"&gt;808th year&lt;/a&gt; of the 1st Era. &lt;a href=\"Hammerfell\"&gt;Hammerfell&lt;/a&gt; was a great desert encompassed by almost impassable mountains -- unclaimed and unwanted. Many of the holidays extant in modern Hammerfell seem to be direct translations of older Redguard festivals before their migration to Tamriel. The orgiastic seasonal celebrations seem unusual in a province with few changes in the weather from month to month. Yet on the 28th of &lt;a href=\"Sun%27s%20Dawn\"&gt;Suns Dawn&lt;/a&gt;, the Redguards of the &lt;a href=\"Banthan%20Forest\"&gt;Banthan jungle&lt;/a&gt; celebrate &lt;a href=\"Aduros%20Nau\"&gt;Aduros Nau&lt;/a&gt; to relieve the wintertide lethargy; on the 1st of Mid Year, the people of &lt;a href=\"Abibon-Gora\"&gt;Abibon-Gora&lt;/a&gt; celebrate &lt;a href=\"Drigh%20R%27Zimb\"&gt;Drigh R'Zimb&lt;/a&gt; in honor of the sun, which no normal Redguard worships in this day; similarly, on the 29th of &lt;a href=\"Sun%27s%20Height\"&gt;Suns Height&lt;/a&gt;, the festival in the Desert called &lt;a href=\"Fiery%20Night\"&gt;Fiery Night&lt;/a&gt;, seems almost perverse in such an environment; the &lt;a href=\"Koomu%20Alezer%27i\"&gt;Koomu Alezer'i&lt;/a&gt; on the 11th of &lt;a href=\"Last%20Seed\"&gt;Last Seed&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Sentinel%20%28Daggerfall%29\"&gt;Sentinel&lt;/a&gt; has been translated as a harvest thanksgiving, though many scholars have suggested that it was once a springtide holiday; similarly, the &lt;a href=\"Feast%20of%20the%20Tiger\"&gt;Feast of the Tiger&lt;/a&gt; in the Bantha on the 14th of &lt;a href=\"Last%20Seed\"&gt;Last Seed&lt;/a&gt; was probably once a religious holiday to a Tiger God, instead of a thanksgiving. Other old Redguard holidays have either been acknowledged as part of the old culture or adjusted to fit with the climate of Hammerfell. The &lt;a href=\"Serpent%27s%20Dance\"&gt;Serpent's Dance&lt;/a&gt;, for example, of &lt;a href=\"Satakalaam%20%28Daggerfall%29\"&gt;Satakalaam&lt;/a&gt; is patently an old festival honoring a Serpent God of the homeland who evidently did not survive the journey to Hammerfell. The significance of the date, the 3rd of &lt;a href=\"Sun%27s%20Dusk\"&gt;Suns Dusk&lt;/a&gt;, has been lost with the Serpent Priests. &lt;a href=\"Baranth%20Do\"&gt;Baranth Do&lt;/a&gt;, on the 18th of Evening Star, and &lt;a href=\"Chil%27a\"&gt;Chil'a&lt;/a&gt;, on the 24th of the same month, are both New Years festivals. Most likely, they have been moved from their original dates to correspond with the notion of the year defined in Tamriel.\nThe Bretons have been in Tamriel since before recorded history. Their holidays have remained almost unchanged since primitive times, though new holidays have been created to replace those which have lost popularity. The oldest holidays still observed in High Rock must include &lt;a href=\"Waking%20Day\"&gt;Waking Day&lt;/a&gt;, on the 18th of &lt;a href=\"Morning%20Star\"&gt;Morning Star&lt;/a&gt;, when the people of the &lt;a href=\"Yeorth%20Burrowland\"&gt;Yeorth Burrowland&lt;/a&gt; wake the spirits of nature after the winter, very nearly in the tradition of their more reverential ancestors. &lt;a href=\"Flower%20Day\"&gt;Flower Day&lt;/a&gt;, held on the 25th of &lt;a href=\"First%20Seed\"&gt;First Seed&lt;/a&gt; in the smaller villages of High Rock is most likely just as old or older. The old cult of the flower is also remembered as &lt;a href=\"Gardtide\"&gt;Gardtide&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Tamarilyn%20Point\"&gt;Tamarilyn Point&lt;/a&gt; on the 1st of &lt;a href=\"Rain%27s%20Hand\"&gt;Rains Hand&lt;/a&gt;. Daggerfall's &lt;a href=\"Day%20of%20the%20Dead\"&gt;Day of the Dead&lt;/a&gt;, on the 13th of Rains Hand, suggests the ancestor worship that marked the Breton religion of antiquity. Finally, the ancient goddess of the moons, &lt;a href=\"Secunda\"&gt;Secunda&lt;/a&gt;, is remembered in the &lt;a href=\"Moon%20Festival\"&gt;Moon Festival&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Glenumbra%20Moors%20%28Daggerfall%29\"&gt;Glenumbra Moors&lt;/a&gt; on the 8th of Suns Dusk, just as the nights begin to grow longer. The more recently created holidays of High Rock are those like &lt;a href=\"Tibedetha\"&gt;Tibedetha&lt;/a&gt;, \"Tibers Day,\" celebrated every 24th of Mid Year in honor of Alcaire's most famous, son, Tiber Septim. Likewise, &lt;a href=\"Othroktide\"&gt;Othroktide&lt;/a&gt; on the 5th of Suns Dawn is held in honor of the first and most illustrious Baron of Dwynnen. In quite extreme contrast, &lt;a href=\"Marukh%27s%20Day\"&gt;Marukh's Day&lt;/a&gt; on the 9th of &lt;a href=\"Second%20Seed\"&gt;Second Seed&lt;/a&gt;, is a solemn holiday, immortalizing the lessons of the equally solemn 1st Era prophet &lt;a href=\"Marukh\"&gt;Marukh&lt;/a&gt;. My favorite of the modern Breton festivals has to be &lt;a href=\"Mad%20Pelagius\"&gt;Mad Pelagius&lt;/a&gt;, held in mock honor of the most eccentric of the Septim Emperors. Pelagius was, after all, a prince of &lt;a href=\"Wayrest%20%28Daggerfall%29\"&gt;Wayrest&lt;/a&gt; before he became King of &lt;a href=\"Solitude\"&gt;Solitude&lt;/a&gt;, and then Emperor of Tamriel. The Bretons like to boast that it was his time in High Rock that drove him mad."}

For unknown reasons, she managed to use much of her power to push the city into the realm of Molag Bal.\nThe Hollow City is very unique, because it can only expand through the help of the &lt;a href=\"Vestige\"&gt;Vestige&lt;/a&gt; by completing quests and making sure the scattered invasion force returns safely to the city.\nHistory.\nWhen it was on\u00a0&lt;a href=\"Nirn\"&gt;Nirn&lt;/a&gt;, Delodiil was populated by\u00a0both &lt;a href=\"men\"&gt;men&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Ayleid\"&gt;Ayleid&lt;/a&gt;s. They worshiped &lt;a href=\"Meridia\"&gt;Meridia&lt;/a&gt; at a glorious cathedral, and their city's prosperity was ensured by magical crystals called the Lights of Meridia.\nDelodiil was a rival city to the much more militaristic city-state of\u00a0&lt;a href=\"Abagarlas\"&gt;Abagarlas&lt;/a&gt;, in which the people worshiped\u00a0Molag Bal.\u00a0The\u00a0King of Abagarlas, &lt;a href=\"Anumaril\"&gt;Anumaril&lt;/a&gt;,\u00a0vowed to completely destroy Delodiil and sacrifice all of its citizens in His name. Unfortunately for him, he couldn't find the city, and his own home was completely destroyed by Meridia in retribution for desecrating a shrine of hers around which Abagarlas was built.\nIn 1E 484, Delodiil was besieged by the minions of &lt;a href=\"Molag%20Bal\"&gt;Molag Bal&lt;/a&gt;, who poured out of portals from Coldharbour. While everyone outside the gates were slain, those inside managed to hold the city. One of their chief defenders was the last Ayleid king,\u00a0&lt;a href=\"Laloriaran%20Dynar\"&gt;Laloriaran Dynar&lt;/a&gt;, who was present during the attack.\nIt soon became clear that the forces of Molag Bal were too great, and that the city would eventually fall. However, Meridia saw an opportunity to both save Delodiil and fight back. Using the portals Molag Bal had opened, she transported the entire city, with all its inhabitants, into Coldharbour. Due to the enchantments protecting Coldharbour, the inhabitants of the city were scattered all across the realm. However, Delodiil itself arrived largely intact, and served as a shelter for many of those who remained. Meridia had thus succeeded in inserting a portion of her own power into Coldharbour, creating a space there that was safe even from Molag Bal himself.\nMany of the original inhabitants of the Hollow City were killed or captured shortly after the city was transported, having arrived in other parts of Coldharbour, far from the city. Nearly all of the remainder fled or died over the next few centuries. Even King Dynar was captured by Molag Bal and imprisoned in the &lt;a href=\"Lightless%20Oubliette\"&gt;Lightless Oubliette&lt;/a&gt;. However, the enchantments protecting the Hollow City were maintained by Meridia, who disguised herself as a woman known as &lt;a href=\"the%20Groundskeeper\"&gt;the Groundskeeper&lt;/a&gt;.\nIn\u00a02E 582, a force of\u00a0&lt;a href=\"Fighters%20Guild%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Fighters Guild&lt;/a&gt;\u00a0and\u00a0&lt;a href=\"Mages%20Guild%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Mages Guild&lt;/a&gt;\u00a0members invaded Coldharbour from &lt;a href=\"Tamriel\"&gt;Tamriel&lt;/a&gt; to stop the\u00a0&lt;a href=\"Planemeld\"&gt;Planemeld&lt;/a&gt;. They rescued Laloriaran Dynar and used the Hollow City as their base of operations, opening portals within it to transport reinforcements and supplies from Nirn. They were ultimately successful in preventing the Planemeld, vindicating Meridia's strategic decision to create the Hollow City centuries before.\nNotable items.\nInside the Fighters Guildhall:\nRestoring the Hollow City.\nDuring the quests The Army of Meridia and The Hollow City, the Vestige must rescue the scattered invasion force of Coldharbour, including &lt;a href=\"Vanus%20Galerion%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Vanus Galerion&lt;/a&gt; and King Laloriaran Dynar. As the Vestige rescues their allies, the city will offer more services such as crafting stations, banks, taverns, and more.\nThe shops and services usually open up after rescuing 10\u201313 people.\nCharacters.\nThere are many characters in the Hollow City, though most arrive after completing certain quests.\nA few characters are already in the Hollow City by default, usually having been there when the city was first pulled in from Nirn.

I guarantee the clan will want to fight.\"\nConversations.\n\"Perhaps you can be more reasonable than this Bosmer. These grounds are forbidden. Allowing them to settle here would threaten the health of the Valenwood. If they do not leave, we will purge them with the forest like a destructive rot.\"\nOption 1.\nI need to discuss this with Indanas. \"Though I have no sense of sentiment, I am able to understand that her intentions are natural and even have merit. Nonetheless, there are larger matters at stake here. This is the way it must be.\"\n\"The loss of life is always tragic, but death is a critical part of nature's cycles. Some things must perish, so that others may thrive. Such is the case here. Though you may mourn for these Bosmer, know that you protected the Valenwood.\"\n\"Sometimes when we are in a dormant state, I dream. I dream that we have another purpose, that we work with the Bosmer to rebuild this place. I hope someday that comes to pass.\"\nOption 2.\nRegardless, that's what's best for the Bosmer."}

The ruling Jarl is dependent on the choices made during the &lt;a href=\"Quests%20%28Skyrim%29%23Civil%20War%20quests\"&gt;civil war questline&lt;/a&gt;, or alternatively, choices made during &lt;a href=\"Season%20Unending\"&gt;Season Unending&lt;/a&gt;.\nIn addition, each plot of land requires one or more quests to be completed before the Jarl will allow the sale to take place. Each plot of land costs 5,000 .\nStage 2: Planning and preparation.\nAfter a plot has been purchased, the building site can be visited to begin planning. A building is typically comprised of several &lt;a href=\"Housebuilding%20Items\"&gt;housebuilding materials&lt;/a&gt; that, when combined, make up the structure of the house.\nUpon arriving at the site, a &lt;a href=\"drafting%20table\"&gt;drafting table&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"carpenter%27s%20workbench\"&gt;carpenter's workbench&lt;/a&gt; can be found nearby. The drafting table is used first to plan any structures to be added, and the carpenter's workbench is then used for the actual building of the house. A copy of the book \"&lt;a href=\"The%20Beginner%27s%20Guide%20to%20Homesteading\"&gt;The Beginner's Guide to Homesteading&lt;/a&gt;\" can be found on each carpenter's workbench.\nIn addition, a starter chest containing thirty &lt;a href=\"clay\"&gt;clay&lt;/a&gt;, one &lt;a href=\"corundum%20ingot\"&gt;corundum ingot&lt;/a&gt;, six &lt;a href=\"Iron%20Ingot%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;iron ingots&lt;/a&gt;, and thirty &lt;a href=\"quarried%20stone\"&gt;quarried stone&lt;/a&gt; can be found by the workbench \u2013 enough to build a &lt;a href=\"Small%20House\"&gt;Small House&lt;/a&gt;. The starter log pile contains 20 logs.\nA useful planning technique for those that want to build a house all at once is to start a spreadsheet. The spreadsheet will have rows for the various materials and columns for \"Required,\" \"Have\" and \"Needed,\" where \"Needed\" is \"Required\" less \"Have.\" As an example:\nThen, go through the page below and the subpages for each &lt;a href=\"%23Appearances\"&gt;section&lt;/a&gt; chosen, increasing \"Required\" based on options chosen. This will let one know ahead of time how many of each resource is needed. Then, as resources are obtained, increase the amount in the \"Have\" cell. Eventually, all of the \"Needed\" cells will be zero or negative, and everything will be ready for the build. Note that many materials, such as nails and hinges, can be smithed from ingots, so it is often easier to express the requirements as end products and not store ingots.\nNote that all costs below are for the bare building costs and do not include the cost of &lt;a href=\"Furnishings%20%28Hearthfire%29\"&gt;furnishing or decorating&lt;/a&gt; a house.\nSawn Logs.\n&lt;a href=\"Sawn%20logs\"&gt;Sawn logs&lt;/a&gt; are a core material in both constructing and &lt;a href=\"Furnishings%20%28Hearthfire%29\"&gt;furnishing&lt;/a&gt; a homestead. Lumber can be purchased from the owner of most &lt;a href=\"Lumber%20Mill\"&gt;lumber mills&lt;/a&gt; throughout &lt;a href=\"Skyrim\"&gt;Skyrim&lt;/a&gt;. The fixed rate is twenty sawn logs for 200 . It is possible to use the saw mill to cut lumber for free, but only if the miller gives permission first.\nTo gain permission to cut wood for the Homestead, one must normally need to do a task for the owner of the lumber mill. This task is generally giving them &lt;a href=\"firewood\"&gt;firewood&lt;/a&gt;. After this, if asked, the owner of the lumber mill will normally grant permission for the &lt;a href=\"Last%20Dragonborn\"&gt;Dragonborn&lt;/a&gt; to use the sawmill. Every time a log is placed and then cut, ten free sawn logs will be received. This can be done for an unlimited amount of times.\nUnlike other building materials, sawn logs are not added to the inventory, rather they are delivered to the building site. Here they exist as a physical object called a \"Log Pile.\" It is possible to see how many are available by pointing the crosshair at the logs. Once the lumber has been obtained, construction can begin.\nStone and clay.\nAdditional quarried stone and clay for future projects can be mined from nearby sources, called \"Stone Quarry\" and \"Clay Deposit\" respectively. These sources can yield 4,000 units each before depleting.\nIron.\n&lt;a href=\"Iron%20Ingot%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Iron&lt;/a&gt; is readily available from &lt;a href=\"Blacksmiths%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;blacksmiths&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"General%20Goods%20Merchants%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;general goods merchants&lt;/a&gt;, or it can be mined. Typically, large amounts are needed in the construction of a homestead, meaning several trips to a merchant is required.\nOre and ingots can often be collected as loot, so if the Dragonborn already owns a place to store resources, such as &lt;a href=\"Breezehome\"&gt;Breezehome&lt;/a&gt;, saving up for a house is an alternative to blacksmithing or selling these resources.\nStewards can be asked to have sawn logs, stone and clay delivered, but they can only be hired once the Small House has been constructed.\nStage 3: Small House.\nActivating the drafting table will allow the first basic layout to begin construction. Choosing a \"Small House Layout\" will mark a rectangular plot on the land where the house will be built.\nNext, move over to the carpenter's workbench where the foundations and supports must be laid. The required materials include quarried stone, clay and sawn logs. Once all the required items are in one's inventory, the sections of the small house can be built.\nThe small house consists of seven components that are spilt into five stages of construction:\nStage 4: Main Hall.\nOnce the Small House layout is complete, the option to add a large Main Hall is available. Like the Small House, the structure and furnishings of the Main Hall is identical no matter what location the homestead is built upon.\nThe Main Hall consists a large dining hall on the ground floor flanked by two wooden staircases. At the north side of the hall is a smaller back room where an optional &lt;a href=\"cellar\"&gt;cellar&lt;/a&gt; can be accessed. Upstairs is an open plan balcony area that leads to a master bedroom on the east side of the house and an identical second bedroom on the west side. The master bedroom can be fitted with a double bed, while the second bedroom can be furnished with two single beds that will be used by the assigned Housecarl or Steward.\nEntry Hall.\nAfter the Main Hall has been built, the initial Small House can be remodeled into an Entry Hall. This gives the option to add a different set of furnishings that are more suited to an entryway. However, it also adds to beds to the upstairs main hall in a configuration that prevents the child chests (or in the case of Lakeview, shared dresser) from being built, which in turn makes the bedroom wing option mandatory if one wishes to have adopted children live in the home. To avoid this, do not convert the small house and use the upstairs workbench to furnish that area manually. After this, the entryway can be converted without impairing adoption.\nStage 5: Wings.\nOnce the Main Hall is complete, additional wings can be constructed that connect to the Main Hall. A maximum of three wings can be added, and each wing gives three possible choices. This allows for twenty-seven possible combinations when all wings are built, however the choice for each wing once constructed is permanent.\nSub types.\nAll nine wings can be grouped into one of three distinct sub-types.\nEach wing sub-type is identical to its counterparts, both inside and out, and they require the same amount of building materials to complete. For example, the Library and the &lt;a href=\"Enchanter%27s%20Tower%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Enchanter's Tower&lt;/a&gt; are essentially the same construct, the difference being their location.\nThe table below illustrates what wing options are available when planning. Each wing offers three options, but only one can be chosen from each row. This means a homestead can potentially support an Enchanter's Tower, Storage Room and Armory. It could not however support a Library, Armory and Kitchen, as these three additions are all part of the East Wing options.\nDespite the appearance of the sub-types being identical, their furnishing vary greatly and it is what gives them their unique function.\nWest Wing.\nThe West Wing may consist of either:\nEnchanter's Tower.\nThe Enchanter's Tower is a towered structure that serves as a dedicated place where &lt;a href=\"Enchanting%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Enchanting&lt;/a&gt; can be practiced. It offers a wide variety of enchanting themed storage and furnishings, such as braziers and an ornate &lt;a href=\"Arcane%20Enchanter%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Arcane Enchanter&lt;/a&gt;. In addition, an armor mannequin and several weapon plaques are available. This is an optional wing, one Enchanting Table is present in the Main Hall.\nBedrooms.\nThe Bedrooms is a rectangular room that offers more spacious sleeping quarters. This addition can be added to adopt up to two children; each child also needs a bed and a chest or dresser. However, if beds and a dresser are added to the second floor west side bedroom in the Main Hall, it will suffice for two children.\nGreenhouse.\nThe Greenhouse is a rectangular room that serves as a dedicated place where plants and vegetables can be grown. It can be useful for growing rare and expensive ingredients, or simply a convenient location to harvest ingredients for &lt;a href=\"Alchemy%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;alchemical&lt;/a&gt; purposes.\nNorth Wing.\nThe available options for the North Wing are:\nTrophy Room.\nThe Trophy Room is a rectangular room that serves as a dedicated place where various &lt;a href=\"Creatures%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;creatures&lt;/a&gt; can be stuffed and put out on display. Furnishings include two types of bases to display creatures; a small base that offers eleven options to choose from and a large base which offers eighteen. Creatures typically take the pose of those seen in &lt;a href=\"Loading%20Screens%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;loading screens&lt;/a&gt;.\nStorage Room.\nThe Storage room is a rectangular room that serves as a dedicated place where various items can be displayed and stored. Fully furnished, it features numerous chests, cupboards and display cases. In addition, decorative mounted animal heads are available.\nAlchemy Laboratory.\nThe Alchemy Laboratory is a towered structure that serves as a dedicated place where &lt;a href=\"Alchemy%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;alchemy&lt;/a&gt; can be practiced. It offers a wide variety of alchemy related storage and furnishings, such as hanging racks and a washbasin. In addition, decorative mounted animal heads are available. Once it is fully furnished, a wide range of ingredients can be found throughout the tower. This is an optional wing, one Alchemy Table is present in the Main Hall.\nEast Wing.\nThe East Wing choices are:\nLibrary.\nThe Library is a towered structure that serves as a dedicated place to store the many &lt;a href=\"Books%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;books&lt;/a&gt; that can be found throughout Skyrim. Its furnishings focus on the several bookshelves that can be fitted. In total, 308 books can be stored in the library. This unfortunately is not enough space to display all available books, as there are 413 individual books, not including journals and notes. However, the main hall master bedroom contains another bookshelf increasing the total shelf space to 362, and books can manually be added to regular shelves, or stacked on tables and the floor using the grab function. Alternatively, shelves can be organized by preferred topics, rarer tomes versus commonplace, or based upon highest value.\nArmory.\nThe Armory is a rectangular room that serves as a dedicated place where various &lt;a href=\"Weapons%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;weapons&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Armor%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;armor&lt;/a&gt; can be displayed and stored. Fully furnished, it features five mannequins, four display cases, and several storage containers. In addition, a &lt;a href=\"workbench\"&gt;workbench&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"grindstone\"&gt;grindstone&lt;/a&gt; can be added.\nKitchen.\nThe Kitchen is a rectangular room that serves as a dedicated location where cooking and baking can take place. Furnishings unique to the kitchen include an &lt;a href=\"oven\"&gt;oven&lt;/a&gt; and a butter churn. The oven can be used to bake a wide selection of foods and the churn can be used periodically to obtain &lt;a href=\"Butter\"&gt;Butter&lt;/a&gt;.\nWing Construction.\nThe components that make up each of the nine wings can be grouped into one of three aforementioned sub-types. This means there is actually only three constructions recipes for all nine wings.\nNote that these totals are for the empty construction of the wing and thus the totals for the furnishings on their pages are \"in addition\" to these totals.\nTower.\nThe construction recipe for the Enchanter's Tower, Alchemy Laboratory or Library is:\nRoom with Outdoor Patio.\nThe construction recipe for the Bedrooms, Storage Room or Armory is:\nDownstairs Room.\nThe construction recipe for the Greenhouse, Trophy Room or Kitchen is:\nStage 6: Exterior.\nThe area surrounding the house may also be developed to include a vegetable patch, a complete set of smithing equipment, and a stable for &lt;a href=\"Horse%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;horses&lt;/a&gt; and an animal pen for &lt;a href=\"Cow%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;cows&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Chicken%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Chickens&lt;/a&gt;. Each Homestead also has specific outside expansions, &lt;a href=\"Lakeview%20Manor\"&gt;Lakeview Manor&lt;/a&gt; has the option of an apiary, &lt;a href=\"Windstad%20Manor\"&gt;Windstad Manor&lt;/a&gt; has the option of a fish Hatchery and &lt;a href=\"Heljarchen%20Hall\"&gt;Heljarchen Hall&lt;/a&gt; has the option of a Grain Mill.\nAnimal Pen.\nAn animal pen is a small enclosure which can be added to any of the three homesteads. A &lt;a href=\"Tanning%20Rack\"&gt;Tanning Rack&lt;/a&gt; is also included when it is built.\nIt can be used to keep a cow and up to three chickens. Chickens will lay &lt;a href=\"Chicken%27s%20Egg\"&gt;eggs&lt;/a&gt; from time to time, however the cow cannot be used to produce milk.\nApiary.\nAn Apiary is a beehive-like enclosure that can be used to breed &lt;a href=\"bee\"&gt;bee&lt;/a&gt;s and produce &lt;a href=\"Honeycomb%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;honeycomb&lt;/a&gt;. These can be collected to use as &lt;a href=\"Ingredients%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;ingredients&lt;/a&gt; to brew &lt;a href=\"Potions%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;potions&lt;/a&gt; at an &lt;a href=\"Alchemy%20Lab%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Alchemy Lab&lt;/a&gt;. It can only be crafted at the homestead of &lt;a href=\"Lakeview%20Manor\"&gt;Lakeview Manor&lt;/a&gt;.\nAfter the Apiary is crafted, bees will soon start to begin to fly around the vicinity. Honeycomb and bees can be collected by activating the Apiary, much like a &lt;a href=\"Containers%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;container&lt;/a&gt;. However, removing these may prevent new bees from spawning. Replacing these items will restart the bee spawning.\nFish Hatchery.\nA Fish Hatchery is a fish breeding enclosure that can be used to breed most of the &lt;a href=\"Fish%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;fish species&lt;/a&gt; found in \"Skyrim\". These can be collected to use as ingredients to brew potions at an Alchemy Lab. It can only be crafted at the homestead of &lt;a href=\"Windstad%20Manor\"&gt;Windstad Manor&lt;/a&gt;.\nGarden.\nA garden is a small planting enclosure which can be added to any of the three homesteads. It can be used for growing almost all plants and fungi found in \"Skyrim\". It is essentially a smaller version of the &lt;a href=\"Greenhouse\"&gt;Greenhouse&lt;/a&gt;.\nAfter the garden is crafted, gardening can begin by activating a patch of fertile soil. Certain ingredients or &lt;a href=\"Food%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;food items&lt;/a&gt; can be planted and only one sample is required for each fertile soil patch. &lt;a href=\"Greenhouse%23Planting\"&gt;See here&lt;/a&gt; for a full list of plants that can be grown.\nThe selected plant will soon grow in the garden, and will reproduce again after it has been harvested. Harvesting typically yields 4 or 5 samples of the plant, rather than only one sample that is obtained from plants in the wild.\nThe patch may be cleared in order to replant new types of plants by activating the fertile soil again.\nGrain Mill.\nA Grain Mill is a workstation that can be used to produce &lt;a href=\"sacks%20of%20flour\"&gt;sacks of flour&lt;/a&gt; from a sample of &lt;a href=\"Wheat%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;wheat&lt;/a&gt;. Activating the mill will begin an animation of pushing the mill and a crafting menu will appear in order to make the sacks of flour. The Grain Mill can only be crafted at the homestead of &lt;a href=\"Heljarchen%20Hall\"&gt;Heljarchen Hall&lt;/a&gt;.\nStable.\nA small stable that can be added to any of the three homesteads. It must be built before a horse can be purchased from a Steward.\nThis cost is in addition to the materials listed in the &lt;a href=\"Homestead%20%28Hearthfire%29%23Standard%20Exterior%20Totals\"&gt;Standard Exterior Totals&lt;/a&gt; below.\nSmithing stations.\nSeveral &lt;a href=\"Smithing%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;smithing&lt;/a&gt; stations may be added to the homestead. Their locations vary slightly, depending on what homestead they are built at.\nStage 7: Cellar.\nBuild and furnish a &lt;a href=\"Cellar\"&gt;Cellar&lt;/a&gt;.\nStage 8: Furnishing.\nUse the links in the table in stage 5 to determine the cost requirements for the up to three wing choices made. Also see &lt;a href=\"Main%20Hall\"&gt;Main Hall&lt;/a&gt; for the miscellaneous items required to decorate the main building.\nPersonnel and animals.\nOne's homestead can be enhanced by the acquiring of personnel and animals. The first member needed is a Steward, since only through a steward can one purchase animals and other personnel. Many followers offer to become a steward as soon as the Small House has been fully built. Once hired, they can purchase a &lt;a href=\"Bards%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Bard&lt;/a&gt; for a price of 1,500 , and a &lt;a href=\"Carriage\"&gt;Carriage&lt;/a&gt;, including a Carriage driver, for 500 . As a thane of the Hold one's homestead is in, a &lt;a href=\"Housecarl\"&gt;Housecarl&lt;/a&gt; will be assigned, who will also be part of the homestead's household. Every Housecarl can double as Steward. The animals that can be purchased for the homestead are a cow, for 200 , three chickens for 25 each, and a horse for 1,000 . To buy them all will cost 3,275 per homestead. Note that animals that are killed can be bought again, but the bard, if killed, cannot be replaced, and there is no option on the steward's menu to buy another."}

For each thought himself most handsome, and the other most ugly.\nThen Lord Vivec chanced by, and settled their dispute. \"No, you BOTH are the ugliest creatures alive, and I will not have my pleasant sojourn spoiled by your unseemly squabbling.\" So he dealt them both mighty blows, shattering their skulls, and silencing their argument, and went merrily upon his way.\nAnd thus Lord Vivec proved that ugliness is as much in one's manner as in one's appearance.\nThe Boiled Kagouti\nIt is said that if a kagouti steps into a boiling pool, he will leap out immediately to avoid harm.\nBut if the kagouti is standing in a pool, and a wizard slowly raises the temperature, measure by measure, to boiling, the kagouti will calmly stand in place until he is boiled.\nThus we see that we must be alert not only to the obvious danger, but also to the subtle degrees by which change may result in danger.\nThe Dubious Healer\nOnce upon a time, a &lt;a href=\"House%20Telvanni%20%28Morrowind%29\"&gt;Telvanni&lt;/a&gt; issued forth from his tower and proclaimed to all the world that he was a mighty and learned healer, master of all &lt;a href=\"alchemy\"&gt;alchemy&lt;/a&gt; and potions, and able to &lt;a href=\"Cure%20Common%20Disease\"&gt;cure all diseases&lt;/a&gt;.\nLord Vivec looked upon this wizard, and listened to his boasting, then asked him, \"How can you pretend to prescribe for others the cure to all diseases, when you are unable to cure yourself of your own manifest arrogance and foolishness?\"\nThe &lt;a href=\"Guar\"&gt;Guar&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Mudcrab\"&gt;Mudcrab&lt;/a&gt;s\nThe Guar were so tormented by the other creatures they did not know where to go. As soon as they saw a single beast approach them, off they dashed in terror.\nOne day they saw a pack of &lt;a href=\"Nix-hound\"&gt;Nix-hound&lt;/a&gt;s ranging about, and in a desperate panic all the Guar scuttled off towards the sea, determined to drown themselves rather than live in such a continual state of fear. But just as they got near the shoreline, a colony of Mudcrabs, frightened in their turn by the approach of the Guar, scuttled off, and threw themselves into the water.\n'Truly,' said one of the Guar, \u201cthings are not so bad as they seem. For there is always someone worse off than you.\"\nThe Wounded &lt;a href=\"Netch\"&gt;Netch&lt;/a&gt;\nA wounded Netch lay himself down in a quiet corner of its feeding-ground. His healthy companions came in great numbers to inquire after his health, yet each one helped himself to a share of the fodder which had been placed there for his use; so that the poor Netch died, not from his wounds, but from the greed and carelessness of his erstwhile friends.\nAnd so it is clear that thoughtless companions may bring more harm than help."}

Any citizen who desires to become &lt;a href=\"Thane%20of%20the%20Rift\"&gt;Thane of the Rift&lt;/a&gt; must purchase property within its realm, and Honeyside is the only property available for purchase by the &lt;a href=\"Last%20Dragonborn\"&gt;Dragonborn&lt;/a&gt;.\nNotable items.\nWith its exterior entry, &lt;a href=\"tanning%20rack\"&gt;tanning rack&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"cooking%20place\"&gt;cooking place&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Alchemy%20Lab%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;alchemy lab&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Arcane%20Enchanter%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;arcane enchanter&lt;/a&gt;, Honeyside can be a useful home for hunters and those who are interested in &lt;a href=\"Alchemy%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;alchemy&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"Enchanting%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;enchanting&lt;/a&gt;. Also, Honeyside is one of two purchasable houses in a city in &lt;a href=\"Skyrim\"&gt;Skyrim&lt;/a&gt; that have exterior areas (porch, dock, and garden), while the other is &lt;a href=\"Solitude%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Solitude's&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Proudspire%20Manor%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Proudspire Manor&lt;/a&gt;.\nAcquisition.\nHoneyside can only be acquired on the path to becoming a Thane of Riften. To achieve this, the Dragonborn must have good reputation with Riften citizens and have proven their worth to the &lt;a href=\"Jarl\"&gt;Jarl&lt;/a&gt;. Below are the steps to acquiring Honeyside.\nAlternatively, using the &lt;a href=\"Console%20Commands%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;console command&lt;/a&gt; codice_1 instantly allows the Honeyside to be purchased from the Jarl's steward, &lt;a href=\"Anuriel\"&gt;Anuriel&lt;/a&gt;.\nStep one: proving worth to the Jarl.\nThis can only be done via the quest \"&lt;a href=\"Skooma%20Trade\"&gt;Skooma Trade&lt;/a&gt;,\" which starts by talking to an &lt;a href=\"Argonians%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Argonian&lt;/a&gt; named &lt;a href=\"Wujeeta\"&gt;Wujeeta&lt;/a&gt; in or near the &lt;a href=\"Riften%20Fishery\"&gt;Riften Fishery&lt;/a&gt; located at the docks outside of Riften.\nWujeeta will want a healing potion in exchange for her talking. Once she has the potion, she will answer questions, giving information about the &lt;a href=\"Skooma%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Skooma&lt;/a&gt; dealer that can be reported to the Jarl. After this, two other quests revolving around putting a stop to the Skooma trade will be received. If Wujeeta is intentionally killed by the Dragonborn during this quest, Honeyside and the title of Thane will no longer be available.\nUpon completion of this quest, the Jarl may begin the formalities of pronouncing the Dragonborn Thane of the Rift if the Dragonborn has a high enough reputation with the citizens of the Rift.\nStep two: building reputation.\nAn improved reputation with the Riften citizens can be attained by doing small tasks and miscellaneous quests for them. Usually, gaining full reputation in The Rift requires completing between four and five of the quests listed below, but this may vary.\nAn indication that they have completed enough of these tasks will appear when the miscellaneous quests section prompts the Dragonborn to talk to the Jarl. At that point, select the first speaking prompt with the Jarl, and she will heartily congratulate the Dragonborn on their good deeds and offer the title of Thane, and then Honeyside can be purchased.\nStep three: purchasing Honeyside.\nAfter enough reputation has been acquired, the Dragonborn can talk to the Jarl's Steward, &lt;a href=\"Anuriel\"&gt;Anuriel&lt;/a&gt;, or &lt;a href=\"Hemming%20Black-Briar\"&gt;Hemming Black-Briar&lt;/a&gt;, if the &lt;a href=\"Civil%20War\"&gt;Civil War&lt;/a&gt; quest line was completed for the Imperials, who will offer to sell a house for 8,000 , but may be bought for as little as 5,000 . If one has at least 5,000 , the option of \"I'll take it\" will be available. With this option selected, she will take all of the Dragonborn's gold, up to 8,000 , and give them the key to Honeyside and the \"&lt;a href=\"Riften%20Home%20Decorating%20Guide\"&gt;Riften Home Decorating Guide&lt;/a&gt;\".\nShe will then sell upgrades to the property.\nHoneyside can also be purchased after the completion of the &lt;a href=\"Skyrim%20Civil%20War\"&gt;Skyrim Civil War&lt;/a&gt; questline if &lt;a href=\"Maven%20Black-Briar\"&gt;Maven Black-Briar&lt;/a&gt; is made Jarl.\nHoneyside is located in the northwest corner of &lt;a href=\"Riften%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Riften&lt;/a&gt;. It can be reached from outside the city by following the path directly west of the &lt;a href=\"Riften%20Stables\"&gt;Riften Stables&lt;/a&gt;."}
