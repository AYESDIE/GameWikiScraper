Northpoint is the ancestral home of &lt;a href=\"House%20Dorell\"&gt;House Dorell&lt;/a&gt;, one of the three major houses of Rivenspire. The Dorell are experts in trading and maritime endeavors.\nDescription.\nGeography.\nNorthpoint is situated on the north-centralmost point of the province of High Rock, specifically in the &lt;a href=\"Boralis\"&gt;Boralis&lt;/a&gt; coast of Rivenspire. Northpoint is situated on the summit of &lt;a href=\"Dore%20Elard\"&gt;Dore Elard&lt;/a&gt;, a steady mountain overlooking the &lt;a href=\"Sea%20of%20Ghosts\"&gt;Sea of Ghosts&lt;/a&gt;. Underneath Dore Elard is the Smuggler's Tunnel, a large cove used by Pirates and other sorts of buccaneers. The outskirts of Northpoint is the &lt;a href=\"Dorell%20Farm\"&gt;Dorell Farm&lt;/a&gt;, which is owned by the same family of the Kingdom. Along the coast is &lt;a href=\"Northsalt%20Village\"&gt;Northsalt Village&lt;/a&gt;, which serves as a minor village and the city's harbor. There is a vast beach that surrounds Dore Elard and hills are found to the south. Northpoint is a walled-off city with a lighthouse jutting out towards the Sea. It has a fairly simple layout, with two entrances to the west and south. The main street goes straight from the south gate to the lighthouse, in the middle is the town square as well as the &lt;a href=\"Dorell%20Manor\"&gt;Dorell Manor&lt;/a&gt;. Deriving from there to the west will lead to the western gate. &lt;a href=\"The%20Sloshing%20Tankard\"&gt;The Sloshing Tankard&lt;/a&gt; is the local inn, on the crossing between the north and west. Near the gates is a path that leads to each other, here are some homes and local businesses.\nHistory.\n&lt;a href=\"First%20Era\"&gt;First Era&lt;/a&gt;.\nFounding of Northpoint; Yric Flowdys' Endeavor.\nThe city-state of Northpoint was founded by a Breton entrepreneur named &lt;a href=\"Yric%20Flowdys\"&gt;Yric Flowdys&lt;/a&gt;, who made the summer route between the city-states of &lt;a href=\"Daggerfall\"&gt;Daggerfall&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Solitude\"&gt;Solitude&lt;/a&gt;. Flowdys had discovered Northpoint in the 9th Century of the first era, noticing the deep waters on the shores. Though it was not ideal for a harbor, it was capable of holding larger ships, and it was a perfect waypoint between two distant yet prevalent Kingdoms. It was there, Flowdys created Northpoint, to which it became an anchorage of the northernmost point of High Rock. After building the docks, Flowdys took to the hills of &lt;a href=\"Dore%20Elard\"&gt;Dore Elard&lt;/a&gt;, where he built several warehouses and a small walled-off keep, near the port. As time went on, the settlement had grown in popularity, establishing Northpoint's hold in the land.\nFounding of Northpoint; The Great House Dorell.\nRealizing the growing success of Northpoint, Yric Flowdys had adopted the name of Dore Elard, taking it as his family name, beginning the career of the Great &lt;a href=\"House%20Dorell\"&gt;House Dorell&lt;/a&gt;. Throughout the generations, the Bretons of House Dorell had continued in their maritime endeavors, as well as, establishing trade to their neighbors. They would then decided to expand on the mainland, in the Boralis Grasslands by leasing farmland and forming new sources of income. Northpoint had grown to the status of a city-state, and the ports would become the village of &lt;a href=\"Northsalt%20Village\"&gt;Northsalt&lt;/a&gt;. Northpoint had brought great prosperity to High Rock and the Sea of Ghosts, so much when in &lt;a href=\"1E%201029\"&gt;1E 1029&lt;/a&gt;, Northpoint was named a Barony under the reign of &lt;a href=\"Empress%20Hestra\"&gt;Empress Hestra&lt;/a&gt; of the &lt;a href=\"Alessian%20Empire\"&gt;Alessian Empire&lt;/a&gt;. On the 24th century of the first era, the Great House Dorell had become one of the three great houses of &lt;a href=\"Rivenspire\"&gt;Rivenspire&lt;/a&gt;, becoming the monarchs of &lt;a href=\"Shornhelm\"&gt;Shornhelm&lt;/a&gt;. Northpoint was the second-largest settlement in Rivenspire.\n&lt;a href=\"Second%20Era\"&gt;Second Era&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe Modern House Dorell in Rivenspire.\nDuring the &lt;a href=\"Interregnum\"&gt;Interregnum&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"2E%20582\"&gt;2E 582&lt;/a&gt;, the city-state of Northpoint was ruled by &lt;a href=\"Lord%20Ellic%20Dorell\"&gt;Lord Ellic Dorell&lt;/a&gt;, the son of &lt;a href=\"Baron%20Alard%20Dorell\"&gt;Baron Alard Dorell&lt;/a&gt;, patriarch of the Great House Dorell. Ellic Dorell manages the House's holdings in Northpoint, as Alard was in Shornhelm with the &lt;a href=\"Council%20of%20the%20North\"&gt;Council of the North&lt;/a&gt;, where he maintains the Dorell Mansion in Shornhelm. Alard Dorell hopes to assume the rule as King of Rivenspire, but only time will tell. Northpoint and House Dorell had established a connection with the &lt;a href=\"Nords\"&gt;Nords&lt;/a&gt; of Solitude in &lt;a href=\"West%20Skyrim\"&gt;West Skyrim&lt;/a&gt;. But around this time, &lt;a href=\"Wylon%20Montclair\"&gt;Wylon Montclair&lt;/a&gt; had waged civil war with the &lt;a href=\"Daggerfall%20Covenant\"&gt;Daggerfall Covenant&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Emeric%20of%20Cumberland\"&gt;Emeric of Cumberland&lt;/a&gt;, continuing from where &lt;a href=\"King%20Ranser\"&gt;King Ranser&lt;/a&gt; had left off from &lt;a href=\"King%20Ranser%27s%20War\"&gt;King Ranser's War&lt;/a&gt;. Alard Dorell and &lt;a href=\"Eselde%20Tamrith\"&gt;Eselde Tamrith&lt;/a&gt; were able to retake Upper Shornhelm, but the conflict had grown to such severe rates. At this point, Ellic Dorell had begun acquainted with &lt;a href=\"Lleraya%20Montclair\"&gt;Lleraya Montclair&lt;/a&gt;, which ultimately proved both Ellic and Northpoint's downfall.\nLleraya's control over Northpoint; Ellic's Folly.\nWith the death of &lt;a href=\"Reezal-Jul\"&gt;Reezal-Jul&lt;/a&gt;, the Daggerfall Covenant had advanced to the north, towards Northpoint, which was taken control by Lleraya Montclair. Lleraya had possessed Ellic and imprisoned him in Dorell Manor, while &lt;a href=\"Bloodfiend\"&gt;Bloodfiend&lt;/a&gt;s were roaming the streets of the city. An &lt;a href=\"Vestige\"&gt;Agent&lt;/a&gt; of the Covenant had infiltrated the walled-off city through the Smuggler's Tunnel and the Northpoint Lighthouse. Using that path, the Covenant's Assault team had invaded the city, defeating the dead in the streets. The Agent was able to enter Dorell Manor, confronting Lleraya Montclair and the possessed Ellic Dorell. In the end, the spell was broken, and Lleraya was defeated. For letting the city fall into enemy hands, Alard Dorell had demoted his son's position as the leader. With Northpoint reclaimed, the Covenant had advanced deep into the Boralis coast, where they established a staging ground towards the summit of &lt;a href=\"the%20Doomcrag\"&gt;the Doomcrag&lt;/a&gt;, where Wylon Montclair was hold up in.\n&lt;a href=\"Third%20Era\"&gt;Third Era&lt;/a&gt;.\nNorthpoint during the Imperial Simulacrum.\nDuring the &lt;a href=\"Imperial%20Simulacrum\"&gt;Imperial Simulacrum&lt;/a&gt; from &lt;a href=\"3E%20389\"&gt;3E 389&lt;/a&gt; to &lt;a href=\"3E%20399\"&gt;3E 399&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Emperor\"&gt;Emperor&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Uriel%20Septim%20VII\"&gt;Uriel Septim VII&lt;/a&gt; was imprisoned along with &lt;a href=\"Talin%20Warhaft\"&gt;Talin Warhaft&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;a href=\"Deadlands\"&gt;Deadlands&lt;/a&gt; by &lt;a href=\"Jagar%20Tharn\"&gt;Jagar Tharn&lt;/a&gt;. Tharn planned for months to capture the throne, and he was able to achieve so in ten years. Tharn had a powerful weapon called the &lt;a href=\"Staff%20of%20Chaos\"&gt;Staff of Chaos&lt;/a&gt;, and he split it into nine pieces and scattered them across Tamriel, the staff was the only thing keeping Uriel Septim and Warhaft in &lt;a href=\"Oblivion\"&gt;Oblivion&lt;/a&gt;. A warrior escaped his clutches and traveled all corners of Tamriel to retrieve the missing pieces. The hero was known as the &lt;a href=\"Eternal%20Champion\"&gt;Eternal Champion&lt;/a&gt;, and he assembled the staff and defeated Jagar Tharn at the &lt;a href=\"Imperial%20Palace\"&gt;Imperial Palace&lt;/a&gt;. The Eternal Champion had at one point visited the city in their quest to recover the pieces. The city of North Point was under the rule of &lt;a href=\"Queen%20Elana\"&gt;Queen Elana&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe Northpoint &amp; Evermore Situation.\nDuring the waning years of the third era, the Kingdoms of Northpoint, &lt;a href=\"Evermore\"&gt;Evermore&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Camlorn\"&gt;Camlorn&lt;/a&gt; were waging war with each other, albeit they were minor skirmishes that have yet to explode into fully-fledged conflict. With the &lt;a href=\"Warp%20in%20the%20West\"&gt;Warp in the West&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"3E%20417\"&gt;3E 417&lt;/a&gt;, both Northpoint and Evermore took advantage of the event, by absorbing minor nations amidst the conflicts. It was enough that they would not interfere with the Warp in the &lt;a href=\"Iliac%20Bay\"&gt;Iliac Bay&lt;/a&gt; or the &lt;a href=\"War%20of%20Bend%27r-Mahk\"&gt;War of Bend'r-Mahk&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;a href=\"Western%20Reach\"&gt;Western Reach&lt;/a&gt;. As of &lt;a href=\"3E%20432\"&gt;3E 432&lt;/a&gt;, both Kingdoms have grown quiet, waiting for their chance all the way into the &lt;a href=\"fourth%20era\"&gt;fourth era&lt;/a&gt;. As of now, there is no information regarding their conflict. Because of &lt;a href=\"Camlorn\"&gt;Camlorn&lt;/a&gt;'s allegiance with &lt;a href=\"Daggerfall\"&gt;Daggerfall&lt;/a&gt;, it is likely that both Northpoint and Evermore were enemies of the western alliance of the Iliac Bay."}

It just requires a small group willing to infiltrate the city.\"\nWalkthrough.\nAfter completing \"&lt;a href=\"The%20Concealing%20Veil\"&gt;The Concealing Veil&lt;/a&gt;,\" &lt;a href=\"Count%20Verandis%20Ravenwatch\"&gt;Count Verandis Ravenwatch&lt;/a&gt; will tell you to head to &lt;a href=\"Northpoint%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Northpoint&lt;/a&gt;. He suspects that &lt;a href=\"Lady%20Lleraya%20Montclair\"&gt;Lleraya Montclair&lt;/a&gt; is active in that area, and may even have control over the city. Verandis will ask you to speak with &lt;a href=\"Baron%20Alard%20Dorell\"&gt;Baron Alard Dorell&lt;/a&gt; when you arrive.\nHead to the northeast of &lt;a href=\"Rivenspire\"&gt;Rivenspire&lt;/a&gt;. On the road to Northpoint, you will find Baron Dorell. Speak with him and he will tell you that Montclair's forces have locked him out of the city, and that his troops are looking for a way in. He will tell you to go and speak with &lt;a href=\"Skordo%20the%20Knife\"&gt;Skordo the Knife&lt;/a&gt;, who is in the nearby farmhouse looking for ways to infiltrate the city. Head into the farmhouse and speak with Skordo. He suggests that they are going to disguise themselves as Montclair's soldiers and sneak into Northpoint, but they need a way in first. He sent &lt;a href=\"Darien%20Gautier\"&gt;Darien Gautier&lt;/a&gt; out to find some sort of hidden entrance, and will direct you to speak with Darien about further plans. \nBefore you head out to speak to Darien, you can talk to one of the soldiers Skordo has captured. If you cannot intimidate him, you will not get anything out of him, but if you can, he will tell you that only the officers know anything, and that they have a camp to the east, overlooking the eastern shore. After that, head out. Darien will be in the Officers' Quarters between your current location and the officer camp, but the door will be locked. Instead, head straight for the camp the soldier described, and you will find a lockbox. It will contain the key to the Officers' Quarters; head in and you will find Darien bare-chested and &lt;a href=\"Captain%20Khala\"&gt;Captain Khala&lt;/a&gt; sleeping on the bed in her underwear. Speak with Darien and he will tell you that he has been doing \"reconnaissance\" here, and has gathered from the captain that there are currently no guards in the city, and that there is a secret tunnel that will lead into the city. \nThe moment you are done talking, &lt;a href=\"Gwendis\"&gt;Gwendis&lt;/a&gt; will appear and offer her expertise on secret tunnels. Speak with her and she will tell you that there is indeed a smuggler's tunnel, but that it has a locked gate. The person who holds the key is a pirate named &lt;a href=\"Captain%20Lagra\"&gt;Captain Lagra&lt;/a&gt;, but it is uncertain whether she is still alive because the Montclairs have been destroying all approaching ships. Gwendis suggests looking for her on the beach to the east. You will find a lot of shipwrecks there, as well as a \"&lt;a href=\"Message%20in%20a%20Bottle%20%28Rivenspire%29\"&gt;Message in a Bottle&lt;/a&gt;\". It will mention that Lagra hid the key in &lt;a href=\"Lagra%27s%20Pearl\"&gt;her ship&lt;/a&gt; as it was sinking, but that her ghost will most likely haunt it and ambush anyone who takes the key. Your next task is to locate her ship, in the waters north of Northpoint. You will spot the ship immediately when you get there; swim over to it and start looking around. The key you are looking for will be in the lockbox on the flooded lower deck. The moment you have it, you will hear the voice of the captain coming from above deck; head up and speak with her. \nLagra wants to fight, but you can intimidate her out of it. If you do not intimidate her, . If you do, she will agree to let you have the key, and will tell you that the secret tunnel is in the cove beneath the lighthouse. After this, you should swim back to the mainland, and you will find Gwendis there waiting for you. She will lead you back to Baron Dorell and the rest; when you have arrived, inform her of everything to finish the quest."}

In the DLC, the &lt;a href=\"Icewater%20Jetty\"&gt;Icewater Jetty&lt;/a&gt; is located to the northwest of the keep.\nLocation.\nThe road to &lt;a href=\"Volskygge\"&gt;Volskygge&lt;/a&gt; (south of Northwatch Keep) leads to a seemingly dead end; however, there is an obscure path down the cliff, but it is easy to miss and will still require the &lt;a href=\"Last%20Dragonborn\"&gt;Dragonborn&lt;/a&gt; to swim across an inlet; so the best route to get to Northwatch Keep is by following the shore from either the west or east. If traveling by means of the path, the &lt;a href=\"Illusion%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Illusion&lt;/a&gt; spell &lt;a href=\"Clairvoyance%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Clairvoyance&lt;/a&gt; is helpful.\nDescription.\nUpon arrival, the Dragonborn is greeted outside by a Thalmor soldier. He will tell the Dragonborn that they cannot enter the fort and that if they attempt to do so they will be met with violence. The Dragonborn cannot enter no matter who was sided with in the &lt;a href=\"civil%20war\"&gt;civil war&lt;/a&gt; and what rank they are. The only way for one to gain access to the keep is by force or the use of &lt;a href=\"Console%20Commands%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;console commands&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe other prisoners can be released by &lt;a href=\"Lockpicking%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;picking&lt;/a&gt; Master locks, or flipping the levers in the room. However once freed, they just stand there. If their cell doors are open and a Northwatch guard attacks the Dragonborn then the prisoners will run out and help fight the guard. However, they will simply walk back to their cells after the guards have been defeated. Attempts to speak with them end with rude generic replies.\nQuests.\n&lt;a href=\"Missing%20in%20Action\"&gt;Missing in Action&lt;/a&gt;.\n&lt;a href=\"Fralia%20Gray-Mane\"&gt;Fralia&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Avulstein%20Gray-Mane\"&gt;Avulstein&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Clan%20Gray-Mane\"&gt;Gray-Mane&lt;/a&gt; ask the Dragonborn to rescue Thorald Gray-Mane from the keep. The Dragonborn can choose to either rescue Thorald alone or with the help of Avulstein, &lt;a href=\"Geirlund\"&gt;Geirlund&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Vidrald\"&gt;Vidrald&lt;/a&gt;, though with the number of Thalmor soldiers and mages in the fort, it will prove difficult to keep Geirlund and Vidrald alive against all of them."}

It begins with a mild fever and random bodily aches and pains. Oddly, afflicted suffering this stage of the plague have a terrible hunger that cannot seem to be satisfied. This stage of the plague lasts anywhere from three to seven days.\nThe second stage of the plague is marked by a high fever, overall weakness, and the appearance of open sores upon the body. Pain grips the afflicted, making most normal activities impossible to perform. During this stage of the plague, the afflicted's appetite disappears, and it is a struggle to make them eat and drink sufficient amounts of food and water to maintain their body weight. This stage of the plague can range from seven to fourteen days. If the afflicted doesn't throw off the plague during this period, chances of survival drop to almost zero.\nThe third stage of the plague marks the beginning of the end for the afflicted. The open sores now cover most of the afflicted's body, which burns with such heat that the afflicted becomes delirious and subject to hallucinations. The afflicted refuses to eat or drink, and any kind of movement results in agony. This stage of the plague is relatively short, lasting from one day in extreme cases to as long as five days for those unfortunate enough to hang on.\nThe final stage of the Llodos plague is perhaps the most fascinating. Of course, many of the afflicted simply die when the plague has run its course. And the death is extremely painful and heartbreaking to watch. But an increasing number of afflicted don't find a natural end. These unfortunates transform into seemingly undead creatures that the common folk call \"plague husks.\" These creatures appear to be mindless engines of violence, intent on destroying all life they encounter.\nCan you imagine an army of such creatures? Priceless!\nAh, the crates of accelerant have arrived! Now we can increase the pace of the affliction. Time to treat my patients.\n\u2014 Nostrum Breva"}

We realize &lt;a href=\"Solstheim%20%28Bloodmoon%29\"&gt;Solstheim&lt;/a&gt; is an inhospitable place, but we go where we are needed. Anyone seeking the cure must perform the Rite of the Wolf Giver, of course. But I do understand the sensitive nature of the ritual, and realize it may not be possible to perform it again and again, if the &lt;a href=\"Hircine\"&gt;Lord Hircine&lt;/a&gt; claims more than one soul.\nSo, I have prepared a &lt;a href=\"Scroll%20of%20the%20Wolf%20Ender\"&gt;Scroll of the Wolf Ender&lt;/a&gt;. The &lt;a href=\"Daedric%20Alphabet\"&gt;Daedric lettering&lt;/a&gt; on that &lt;a href=\"Scrolls%20%28Morrowind%29\"&gt;scroll&lt;/a&gt; contains all the power of the ritual itself. I have taken great pains to prepare the parchment, and it will work as well as the Rite of the Wolf Giver. But heed these words! I do not wish the scroll to be used unless absolutely necessary! It was not easily created, and it is the wish of the Coven that it be saved for future use if possible\nThe scroll has already been hidden in the &lt;a href=\"Gloomy%20Cave\"&gt;gloomy cave&lt;/a&gt; that will serve as your hovel for the duration of your stay on Solstheim. It is inside the hollowed-out icicle that hangs from the cave's ceiling. You'll need to use your raven form or a &lt;a href=\"Standard%20Rising%20Force%20Potion\"&gt;potion of&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Levitate%20%28Morrowind%29\"&gt;levitation&lt;/a&gt; -- to reach it.\nAgnes"}

However, until such time as the claimant actually has been named &lt;a href=\"Hortator\"&gt;Hortator&lt;/a&gt; separately and jointly by the three Great Houses of Vvardenfell, and at the same time has been named Nerevarine separately and jointly by the four tribes of the &lt;a href=\"Ashlanders%20%28Morrowind%29\"&gt;Ashlanders&lt;/a&gt;, there is no purpose in reviewing or discussing these claims.\nBecause of the Temple's official position on the prophecies of the Nerevarine, and in the interests of preserving the security of the claimant from those parties who might wish to do him harm, it is convenient that the claimant of the title Nerevarine shall present himself in secret to Archcanon Saryoni in the archcanon's private quarters in the &lt;a href=\"High%20Fane\"&gt;High Fane&lt;/a&gt; of Vivec.\nTo signify agreement with these terms and conditions for a meeting with the archcanon, the Nerevarine claimant may present himself to the healer of the High Fane of Vivec, &lt;a href=\"Danso%20Indules\"&gt;Danso Indules&lt;/a&gt;, and the necessary arrangements will be made. Once again, no purpose is served by a meeting until the claimant is named Hortator of the three Great Houses and is named Nerevarine of the four Ashlander tribes.\nwritten at the request of and in the name of his Reverend Honor Tholer Saryoni, Archcanon and Chancellor of Vivec,\n&lt;a href=\"Dileno%20Lloran\"&gt;Dileno Lloran&lt;/a&gt;, priest of Vivec, assistant to the Archcanon"}

At the age of nineteen, he went to the &lt;a href=\"Imperial%20City\"&gt;Imperial City&lt;/a&gt; to study. There were few Redguards who had been to the Imperial Province at the time, and it may be that he took the last name Melarg in order to assimiliate with the &lt;a href=\"Bretons%20%28Daggerfall%29\"&gt;Breton&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Nords%20%28Daggerfall%29\"&gt;Nordic&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Dunmer%20%28Daggerfall%29\"&gt;Dark Elf&lt;/a&gt; cultures he encountered there.\"\nWhen he died ninety-four years later, he left numerous unfinished histories and untranslated verse. Very few of this fragmented work has found its way out of collections. What follows is an unmailed letter to Melarg's publishers in the Imperial City. The insights into the man who put the oral traditions of the Redguards to paper impressed me enough to seek its publication.\nMelius, it should be noted, was &lt;a href=\"Melius%20Kane\"&gt;Melius Kane&lt;/a&gt;, Melarg's publisher in the Imperial City.\n-- &lt;a href=\"Vune\"&gt;Vune&lt;/a&gt;,Redguardic First Scholar &lt;a href=\"Imperial%20University\"&gt;Imperial University&lt;/a&gt;\nMelius,\nThis is the outline of my final chapter for the series on &lt;a href=\"Hammerfell\"&gt;Hammerfell&lt;/a&gt; heroes. I condensed &lt;a href=\"Dendle\"&gt;Dendle's&lt;/a&gt; storytelling. I have my notes, but the story gets long with all the quotes. She puts a lot of dialog in her storytelling. I am amazed that the old stories about the 5 swords keeps cropping up. It's been a thousand years since &lt;a href=\"Hellion\"&gt;Hellion's&lt;/a&gt; time, yet people continue to believe in the stories.\nThe wagon master sat with me after listening to her story and smoked a pipe with me. In discussing the story, he said that his storyteller used to say that one of the five swords survived the closing of the &lt;a href=\"Goblin\"&gt;Goblin&lt;/a&gt; gate, and is yet hidden here in Hammerfell. It was the least of the five, but the story has it that it exceeds and modern blade magical or ebony by several orders of magnitude.\nOf course I take this with a grain of salt, since an ebony weapon is unparalleled in its keen cutting ability and personally I can't imagine a weapon doing more damage than a Claymore of Firestorm or a Saber of Life Steal. Dendle even believes that out in the countryside outside of &lt;a href=\"Skaven\"&gt;Skaven&lt;/a&gt; in one of the &lt;a href=\"Halls%20of%20the%20Virtues%20of%20War\"&gt;Halls of the Virtues of War&lt;/a&gt;, there are still people who follow the old ways and can from a &lt;a href=\"Shehai\"&gt;Shehai&lt;/a&gt; or spirit sword.\nIn collecting these stories, I once thought I was seeing a Shehai being formed, by an old Hall master, but the thing, if it was a spirit sword was so faint that even the sword shape was questionable. I didn't want to insult the old man so I claimed I saw it too. But if that was a Shehai, I can't imagine it possibly used as a real weapon.\nHere's my outline of the new story:\nAt the time of this story, Hammerfell is fully occupied by Redguards. All the old cities of the &lt;a href=\"Dwemer\"&gt;Dwarves&lt;/a&gt; (but one - the Ghost City of &lt;a href=\"Dwarfhome\"&gt;Dwarfhome&lt;/a&gt;) are now the cities of today's modern Hammerfell. A second invasion of the giant goblins comes. Hammerfell is unprepared, except for a few faithful followers, all youths in the rural Halls of Virtue.\n&lt;a href=\"Hallin\"&gt;Hallin&lt;/a&gt;, being the only &lt;a href=\"Ansei\"&gt;Ansei&lt;/a&gt;, rallies the armies of Hammerfell. After a defeat, he brings back the old ways by telling each warrior to read the &lt;a href=\"Book%20of%20Circles\"&gt;Book of Circles&lt;/a&gt;. The army fights the Goblins to a standstill, but things look bleak, just as in &lt;a href=\"Divad%20Hunding\"&gt;Divad&lt;/a&gt;'s song. Somehow the goblins keep being resupplied both with arms and troops. Eventually the Army of Hammerfell will lose.\nThe old master of Hallin's Hall of the Virtues of War has an ancient copy of Divad's will and testament, and reads it to Hallin. It tells him that the 5 swords aren't lost, just hidden and well guarded in 5 caves. Each cave is home to a master guardian, one of the old blind Ansei -- and also a maze.\nAccording to the will, &lt;a href=\"Derik\"&gt;Derik&lt;/a&gt; must, along with a virtuous companion of pure heart enter the cave, defeat each Ansei Master and retrieve their sword.\nDendle went into great detail here. It seems that each Master had an outstanding trait -- one &lt;a href=\"Katrice\"&gt;Katrice&lt;/a&gt;, possessed feline grace, and had become very catlike; another, who had icy calm was something much like an &lt;a href=\"Ice%20Golem\"&gt;Ice Golem&lt;/a&gt;.\nOn each blade is inscribed part of an intricate message on how to use the power of the swords combined. Derik scours the rural Halls for Brothers of the Blade and Maidens of the Spirit Sword to accompany him in the quests. He finally one by one finds his companions, and wins each sword.\nThey learn from the blades and together wield the force of the 5 swords to seal the rent in space time that the Goblins have made and from which springs their invasion. Hallin's companions avoided blinding by the magic swords by hurling the swords together into the void, and sealing forever the giant Goblins in the void between their world and ours.\nThe land is saved and Hallin and his companions (3 women and 2 men) become Ansei and restore the teachings of &lt;a href=\"Frandar%20Hunding\"&gt;Frandar Hunding&lt;/a&gt; to Hammerfell.\nThat's the story in brief. I welcome any comments from you or one of the other editors.\nOne other concern of mine. I understand that you are considering using a better known writer, &lt;a href=\"Uthilla%20Abuhk\"&gt;Uthilla Abuhk&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"Casmyr%20Kreestrom\"&gt;Casmyr Kreestrom&lt;/a&gt;, to write the stories I've researched. I can understand that a better known writer may mean that a few more copies of the books will be sold, but that should not be your only concern. Abuhk and Kreestrom, while fine writers and poets, will need to be lectured on the true history of the Redguards. Even if you are willing to pay me to do that, you will have to acknowledge that the books will take longer to write than if you just allowed me to do it. Just something to consider when you make the decision.\nI hope this letter finds you, your consort, and children to good health and humor.\nYours faithfully,Destri Melarg"}

Under the civilized peace of the Grand Council, and with the strong central authority of the &lt;a href=\"Tribunal%20Temple\"&gt;Temple&lt;/a&gt;, the economic and military power of the settled Dunmer quickly outstripped that of the nomadic Dunmer. The nomadic Dunmer were marginalized into the poorest, most hostile land, in particular, into the &lt;a href=\"Vvardenfell%20%28Morrowind%29\"&gt;Vvardenfell&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Ashlands\"&gt;wastes&lt;/a&gt;. For the Ashlanders, the return of a reincarnated &lt;a href=\"Nerevar\"&gt;Nerevar&lt;/a&gt; represents a longed for and largely romanticized Golden Age of Nerevar's Peace, when the nomadic tribes enjoyed equality with the settled Dunmer, and before the Dunmer people had for the most part abandoned traditional ancestor worship for the autocratic theocracy of the Tribunal Temple.\nThe Nerevar of the Ashlanders.\nThis is the story of Nerevar as an Ashlander might tell it.\nIn ancient days, the Deep Elves and a great host of outlanders from the West came to steal the land of the Dunmer. In that time, Nerevar was the &lt;a href=\"Hortator\"&gt;great khan and warleader&lt;/a&gt; of the House People, but he honored the Ancient Spirits and the Tribal law, and became as one of us. So, when Nerevar pledged upon his great Ring of the Ancestors, &lt;a href=\"Moon-and-Star\"&gt;One-Clan-Under-Moon-and-Star&lt;/a&gt;, to honor the ways of the Spirits and rights of the Land, all the Tribes joined the House People to fight a great battle at &lt;a href=\"Battle%20of%20Red%20Mountain\"&gt;Red Mountain&lt;/a&gt;. Though many Dunmer, Tribesman and Houseman, died at Red Mountain, the &lt;a href=\"Dwemer\"&gt;Dwemer&lt;/a&gt; were defeated and their evil magicks destroyed, and the &lt;a href=\"Nords%20%28Morrowind%29\"&gt;outlanders&lt;/a&gt; driven from the land. But after this great victory, the power-hungry khans of the Great Houses slew Nerevar in secret, and, setting themselves up as &lt;a href=\"Tribunal\"&gt;gods&lt;/a&gt;, neglected Nerevar's promises to the Tribes. But it is said that Nerevar will come again with his ring, and cast down the false gods, and by the power of his ring will make good his promises to the Tribes, to honor the Spirits and drive the outsiders from the land.\nPersecution of the Nerevarine Cult.\nThe Tribunal Temple regards the &lt;a href=\"Mysticism%20%28Morrowind%29\"&gt;mysticism&lt;/a&gt; and prophecy of the Nerevarine cult as primitive superstition. The Ashlander Ancestor cults and the Nerevarines in particular have always decried the worship of living Dunmer as abominations, suspecting the unnatural lifetimes of the Tribunal to be signs of profane sorcery or &lt;a href=\"necromancy\"&gt;necromancy&lt;/a&gt;. Though the authoritarian and intolerant Temple priesthood has always been inclined to tolerate Ashlander ancestor cult practices, they have always threatened Nerevarine claimants with death or imprisonment. And while generally tolerant of various cult worships, the &lt;a href=\"Imperial%20Commission\"&gt;Imperial Commission&lt;/a&gt; of the Occupation outlaws cults hostile to the Emperor and the Empire, and threatens members of such cults with imprisonment or death. The &lt;a href=\"Ordinator%20%28Morrowind%29\"&gt;Ordinators&lt;/a&gt; are allowed a free hand when dealing with outlawed cults like the Nerevarines.\nPeakstar and other Incarnates in the Past.\nIn the past, others have claimed to be the reincarnated Nerevar of prophecy. The most recent is known as Peakstar, a mysterious figure who has reportedly appeared and disappeared among the Wastes tribes over the last 30 years. The Temple notes that these False Incarnates discredit the Nerevarine prophecies. Singularly, and illogically, the Ashlanders acknowledge a history of false claimants, calling them \"Failed Incarnates,\" but they regard them as proof of the validity of the prophecies, rather than contradiction. Among the Nerevarines there is a fable of a &lt;a href=\"Cavern%20of%20the%20Incarnate%20%28Morrowind%29\"&gt;Cavern of the Incarnate&lt;/a&gt;s, where the spirits of the Failed Incarnates dwell. The Nerevarine cult is a mystical cult, and it glorifies, rather than shrinks from, contradictions."}

All the dangers I have escaped, the traps I have eluded and the foul &lt;a href=\"Draugr%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;draugr&lt;/a&gt; I have avoided have brought me at last to this.\nIn my previous volume of notes and observations regarding &lt;a href=\"Dimhollow%20Crypt\"&gt;Dimhollow Crypt's&lt;/a&gt; possible connections to the &lt;a href=\"Ancient%20Vampire%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Ancient Vampire&lt;/a&gt; clans of &lt;a href=\"Skyrim\"&gt;Skyrim's&lt;/a&gt; history, I wrote of a great chamber, far larger than anything else I've yet seen here in the crypt.\nAlas, a few wandering draugr forced me to retreat to the earlier passages of the crypt, thus depriving me of an opportunity to study this huge cavern.\"\nWell, praise be to &lt;a href=\"Stendarr\"&gt;Stendarr&lt;/a&gt;, for as I write this, I have just spent nearly a full day exploring that very cavern.\nIt was a risk that proved more than worth it, because what I found in that chamber nearly defies description.\nCentral to this huge cavern is an island of stone in a subterranean lake. Upon this island is something I can only describe as an elaborate ceremonial construction surrounded by stone columns linked by arches.\nThere is no mistaking the stark contrast in architecture here; no ancient &lt;a href=\"Nords%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Nords&lt;/a&gt; make this stonework. Here, too, were more of the &lt;a href=\"Gargoyle%20%28Dawnguard%29\"&gt;gargoyle&lt;/a&gt; statues that i first glimpsed in earlier passageways.\nThere is no draugr burial site in Skyrim that contains these statues, save Dimhollow Crypt.\nIndeed, I am now certain that the strange construct in this main chamber was built long after the crypt, and by wholly different masters. These must be the same builders who placed the gargoyles through the crypt, perhaps to frighten away the curious.\nAll signs seem to indicate that the masons who crafted these strange arches were servants of some ancient master who favored &lt;a href=\"necromancy\"&gt;necromancy&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"Vampirism%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;vampirism&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe style and craftsmanship in the stonework are not only distinct in terms of design, seeming to speak of an entirely different culture than that of the old Nord peoples, but also in skill with which they were fashioned.\nThe cutting and shaping of the stone, for example, suggests more sophisticated tools than the crypt's original architects would have possessed.\nAlthough I feel a sense of exhilaration that my theories have at last been confirmed beyond any shadow of a doubt, I am also disappointed at the lack of answers. How long ago were these new features added to the crypt? And by whom? And for what purpose?\nOn one point, I have no doubts. I must return to the Hall of the Vigilant and share these findings with my brothers and sisters. When they see what I've discovered with their own eyes, they will no longer scoff at my theories or mock my endeavors.\nAnd when that is done, I will return to my work. For now, Dimhollow Crypt might be a mystery, but by Stendarr I will see that mystery solved."}

Where the &lt;a href=\"Ayleid\"&gt;Ayleid&lt;/a&gt;s departed &lt;a href=\"Summerset%20Isle\"&gt;Summerset Isle&lt;/a&gt;, the Altmer remained; yet their structures share many common elements. One only need walk the ruins near &lt;a href=\"Bravil%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Bravil&lt;/a&gt;, then compare paintings of &lt;a href=\"Skywatch%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Skywatch&lt;/a&gt; for corroboration. Subtle changes are less obvious: while the Altmer are snobbish, they never sank to Ayleid levels of perniciousness, and the more refined buildings of &lt;a href=\"Auridon\"&gt;Auridon&lt;/a&gt; reflect this.\nSuch structural designs stem from ancient roots, using methods tried and tested, but not to the point of becoming obsolete. The Altmer seek refinement rather than innovation, and they are conceitedly resistant to large-scale changes but are content to tinker. The results reveal highly sophisticated precision, harmony, and the selection and repetition of orthodox compositions."}

Orichalcum is green, exceptionally rigid, stronger than steel, and extremely temperamental. Just like most Orcs!\nMost miners, when they discover Orichalcum veins, see them as a welcome sight. Excavations tend to be less onerous given that Orichalcum is often found in brittle shale. The deposits also tend to be free of gangue, making ore dressing unnecessary. The real challenges with the mineral can be found in the smelting process.\nOrichalcum is notoriously difficult to smelt. A consistent low heat must be maintained to prevent the metal from becoming brittle and cracking. Iron is often introduced to act as a binding, but most of the Orcish smiths I spoke to dismissed the idea as evidence of laziness or lack of skill. According to the famed smith &lt;a href=\"Gurzbog%20gra-Gulog\"&gt;Gurzbog gra-Gulog&lt;/a&gt;, pure Orichalcum is far lighter and stronger than its iron-alloyed alternative. After inspecting both metals, I'm inclined to agree. Both were remarkably heavy, but the disparity in weight was not insignificant. The Orcs' reliance on massive plate armor makes any difference in weight important.\nOrichalcum weapons retain their sharpness far longer than most weapons made with conventional metals, and they are remarkably resistant to rust and chipping. The unique color is also noteworthy\u2014not as gaudy as High Elven glass and not as drab as iron or steel.\nI am eager to speak with more smiths here in Orsinium.

It is less clear whether the &lt;a href=\"Argonians\"&gt;Argonians&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Khajiit\"&gt;Khajiit&lt;/a&gt; are interfertile with both humans and elves. Though there have been many reports throughout the Eras of children from these unions, as well as stories of unions with daedra, there have been no well documented offspring. Khajiit differ from humans and elves not only their skeletal and dermal physiology -- the \"fur\" that covers their bodies -- but their metabolism and digestion as well. Argonians, like the dreugh, appear to be a semi-aquatic troglophile form of humans, though it is by no means clear whether the Argonians should be classified with dreugh, men, mer, or (in this author's opinion), certain tree-dwelling lizards in &lt;a href=\"Black%20Marsh\"&gt;Black Marsh&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe reproductive biology of &lt;a href=\"orcs\"&gt;orcs&lt;/a&gt; is at present not well understood, and the same is true of &lt;a href=\"goblin\"&gt;goblin&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"troll\"&gt;troll&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"Harpy\"&gt;harpies&lt;/a&gt;, dreugh, &lt;a href=\"tsaesci\"&gt;tsaesci&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"imga\"&gt;imga&lt;/a&gt;, various daedra and many others. Certainly, there have been cases of intercourse between these \"races,\" generally in the nature of rape or magickal seduction, but there have been no documented cases of pregnancy. Still the interfertility of these creatures and the civilized hominids has yet to be empirically established or refuted, likely due to the deep cultural differences. Surely any normal &lt;a href=\"Bosmer\"&gt;Bosmer&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"Breton\"&gt;Breton&lt;/a&gt; impregnated by an orc would keep that shame to herself, and there's no reason to suppose that an orc maiden impregnated by a human would not be likewise ostracized by her society. Regrettably, our oaths as healers keep us from forcing a coupling to satisfy our scientific knowledge. We do know, however, that the &lt;a href=\"sload\"&gt;sload&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"Thras\"&gt;Thras&lt;/a&gt; are hermaphrodites in their youth and later reabsorb their reproductive organs once they are old enough to move about on land. It can be safely assumed that they are not interfertile with men or &lt;a href=\"mer\"&gt;mer&lt;/a&gt;.\nOne might further wonder whether the proper classification of these same \"races,\" to use the imprecise but useful term, should be made from the assumption of a common heritage and the differences between them have arisen from magickal experimentation, the manipulations of the so-called \"&lt;a href=\"Ehlnofey\"&gt;Earth Bones&lt;/a&gt;,\" or from gradual changes from one generation to the next."}

I have decided to focus mainly on the taxonomic order Skeevera, a much neglected area of study. It is also a far safer endeavor than more popular subjects such as giant insects or &lt;a href=\"Troll%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Trolls&lt;/a&gt;. By avoiding such risks, I will be able to travel farther at less expense, eliminating the need for hired mercenaries.\n16 First Seed\nMy journey officially began today. As I made my way to the city walls, I took the opportunity to observe many of the rats that infest the sewers and trash heaps. Often overlooked in daily life, they really are quite a presence in the city. Living amongst and feeding on our waste, the common rat is quite at home in even the most inhospitable climates. Disease often follows it closely, making the rat one of the scourges of any major settlement.\n21 First Seed\nImmediately outside the city limits I began to see a wider variety of wildlife. The most common specimen of Skeevera found outside of a town is the &lt;a href=\"Rabbit%20%28Online%29\"&gt;rabbit&lt;/a&gt;. The rabbit commonly inhabits meadows and forests. It hides from its many predators in underground warrens. One may occasionally see a rabbit as a pet, but it is far more common to find one in a pie or a stew.\nToday is &lt;a href=\"Hogithum\"&gt;Hogithum&lt;/a&gt;, a fact I had forgotten until I almost stumbled upon two &lt;a href=\"Dunmer%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Dunmeri&lt;/a&gt; priests performing their annual ritual in the forest. I felt it wiser to avoid them, and quietly slipped away before I was noticed.\n7 &lt;a href=\"Rain%27s%20Hand\"&gt;Rain's Hand&lt;/a&gt;\nIt has been raining for two weeks now. Impossible to stay dry. I have been able to keep a fire burning only because of my rudimentary &lt;a href=\"magic\"&gt;magic&lt;/a&gt; lessons at the University. The downpour has been too heavy to observe any wildlife. Even the &lt;a href=\"Wolf%20%28Online%29\"&gt;wolves&lt;/a&gt; are hiding.\nAs interesting as the smaller creatures are, I long for something more \u2026 exciting. When the rain finally lets up I may choose to continue my studies elsewhere.\n12 Rain's Hand\nFinally, a break in the clouds!\n14 Rain's Hand\nI have located a wild &lt;a href=\"Skeever%20%28Online%29\"&gt;skeever&lt;/a&gt; nest and have begun my observations. Like their rat cousins, skeevers often carry disease. However, the skeever is a major food source for many larger predators. &lt;a href=\"Giant%20Spider\"&gt;Giant spiders&lt;/a&gt; will always have a few hanging in their webs. It is not uncommon to even find a skeever cooking over a camp fire.\nTomorrow I will attempt to capture a skeever for closer observation and dissection. One skeever should give me no trouble.\n15 Rain's Hand\nToday I attempted to catch one of the skeevers. The nest of creatures caught my scent before I got close enough to grab one. I got away but these bite wounds look like they might be getting infected. Perhaps traveling alone was not the wisest of decisions."}

They seem to form a narrative. And if my admittedly limited knowledge of the language serves me, it's the classic Elven cosmogony:\nFirst there was &lt;a href=\"Aurbis\"&gt;Aurbis&lt;/a&gt;, the formless chaos from which the universe was formed. Then Lorkhan convinced the &lt;a href=\"Aedra\"&gt;Aedra&lt;/a&gt; to sacrifice themselves to create the world, &lt;a href=\"Mundus\"&gt;Mundus&lt;/a&gt;.

Chaos, earth, and magic. Perhaps it's central to his understanding of creation, not just of the world, but of constructs as well?\nI will have to ruminate on this later. For now I'll try my hand at picking the lock. Perhaps I'll have success with the mundane where magic failed."}

He will tell you that his clan fear an attack from the &lt;a href=\"Drublog%20Clan\"&gt;Drublog Clan&lt;/a&gt; after his daughter &lt;a href=\"Dalaneth\"&gt;Dalaneth&lt;/a&gt; was found with the son of the Drublog chief. He will ask you to go speak with his daughter to see if she will tell you anything. \nDalaneth is in a hut in the north of the area, just south of the &lt;a href=\"Supplication%20House\"&gt;Supplication House&lt;/a&gt;. Speak with her and she will tell you that she and her love, &lt;a href=\"Ulagash\"&gt;Ulagash&lt;/a&gt;, were found by &lt;a href=\"Shaman%20Yarnag\"&gt;Shaman Yarnag&lt;/a&gt; as they were embracing by the lake a few days ago. Since then, all attempts at dialogue have ended in violence. Dalaneth will ask you to help ensure Ulagash's safety; he is at the Shrine to Mauloch just south of the map marker. When you arrive at the shrine, you will find that Yarnag has killed Ulagash after torturing him. \nTake this news to Mathragor, who will be hiding behind a wall just north of the shrine. He will tell you that while you were gone, the Orimser attacked the village. He could not find his daughter before he was forced to flee; he will ask you to look for his fellow villagers who fled into the forest and ask them if they know where Dalaneth is. The villagers are spread out throughout the area. &lt;a href=\"Huurel\"&gt;Huurel&lt;/a&gt; will be in the east of the area, just north of the river. &lt;a href=\"Gothrongor\"&gt;Gothrongor&lt;/a&gt; will be to the west, just east of the road. Finally, Falphirion is hiding behind the hut where you first met Dalaneth. None of them have seen Dalaneth; once you have spoken to all of them, head back to Mathragor. He will speculate that the Drublog have taken his daughter, and will ask you to kill their chief in vengeance. Chief Ulukhaz will be in her longhouse above the shrine to Mauloch, with Dalaneth lying on the ground in front of her. Kill the chief, then talk to Dalaneth. She will tell you that Yarnag had used a ritual involving Ulagash's blood to corrupt the chief, and will ask you to ask her father to stop the bloodshed. \nMeet up with Mathragor in the Shrine to Z'en in the northeast of the area, and relay Dalaneth's message. He will not agree to stop the bloodshed; he thinks the only way to achieve peace is to wipe out the Drublog. As such, he will pray to Z'en for a curse. At this point an Emissary of Z'en will appear. Speak to the emissary and she will tell you to stop Mathrogor from enacting his curse, for it is not justice he seeks, but vengeance. You should now speak to Mathrogor; you can persuade him out of his quest for vengeance to finish the quest. If you do not persuade him, ."}

So it ain't like you can't put a belt to the pot, should it come to that.\nBut them little scribs were chewing that stuff like it was cooked up by &lt;a href=\"Balagog%20gro-Nolob\"&gt;the Gourmet&lt;/a&gt;. In fact, their leader wanted me to throw my boots into the pot, seeing as they was leather too.\nI tried to tell the little monster that my whole armor was made of &lt;a href=\"Netch%20Leather%20%28Dragonborn%29\"&gt;netch leather&lt;/a&gt;. Ain't the same as &lt;a href=\"Cow%20Hide\"&gt;hide&lt;/a&gt; from some old &lt;a href=\"Cow%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Nord cow&lt;/a&gt;. Something got lost in translation though, because they thought it was some holy relic, and started painting their little marks on it.\nAs they were taking the armor back to their huts, I tried to explain that it wasn't special, even showed him some sketches on netch leather crafting, but their leader thought it was a cookbook and took that too.

I drank down the contents of my healing &lt;a href=\"Potions%20%28Morrowind%29\"&gt;potion&lt;/a&gt;, but that did not nullify the effects of the poison. I fear my innards are slowly liquefying. I shall be dead within the day, laughing about my recent lack of luck.\nI have with me, the key to a lock I have yet to find. I found the key just inside the main entrance. Perhaps it is the key to the Dwemer riches. For, I will never know.\nIf one shall happen across my note, congratulations on making it thus far. And do not drink the rest of the bottle here. It tastes like &lt;a href=\"Guar%20%28Morrowind%29\"&gt;Guar&lt;/a&gt; bile, but is 10 times deadlier.\nPeke Utchoo"}

Pelagius Septim II inherited a host of debts due to his father's poor financial and judicial management. To cope with this, he dismissed all of the &lt;a href=\"Elder%20Council\"&gt;Elder Council&lt;/a&gt;, allowing only those members willing to pay a large sum of money re-entry. He encouraged similar actions of other Kings and rulers throughout the then un-united Tamriel.\nHe is believed to also have had a brother and sister, although the only evidence of this is \"&lt;a href=\"The%20Wolf%20Queen%2C%20Book%20I\"&gt;The Wolf Queen&lt;/a&gt;\" series of books. In it, in &lt;a href=\"3E%2080\"&gt;3E 80&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Amiel%20Septim\"&gt;Amiel Septim&lt;/a&gt;, his brother, is purportedly in &lt;a href=\"Firsthold\"&gt;Firsthold&lt;/a&gt;, meeting with the &lt;a href=\"Arch-Mage\"&gt;Archmagister&lt;/a&gt; of the &lt;a href=\"Mages%20Guild\"&gt;Mages Guild&lt;/a&gt;. His sister, &lt;a href=\"Galana%20Septim\"&gt;Galana Septim&lt;/a&gt;, is to be married to the Duke of &lt;a href=\"Narsis\"&gt;Narsis&lt;/a&gt;.\nThese actions saw Tamriel's return to relative prosperity, though many critics pointed out the gold he extracted had been gotten forcibly. Pelagius Septim II had a daughter, &lt;a href=\"Potema%20Septim\"&gt;Potema Septim&lt;/a&gt;, and three sons: &lt;a href=\"Cephorus%20Septim\"&gt;Cephorus Septim&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Magnus%20Septim\"&gt;Magnus Septim&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Antiochus%20Septim\"&gt;Antiochus Septim&lt;/a&gt;. The first three were involved in the &lt;a href=\"War%20of%20the%20Red%20Diamond\"&gt;War of the Red Diamond&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"3E%20121\"&gt;3E 121&lt;/a&gt;, long after Pelagius Septim II's death. &lt;a href=\"Antiochus%20Septim\"&gt;Antiochus Septim&lt;/a&gt; was significantly older than the other three, being 48 at the time that he became emperor \nPelagius died of natural causes after seventeen years of rule on the 15th of &lt;a href=\"Evening%20Star\"&gt;Evening Star&lt;/a&gt; in 3E 98.

Later, he married a &lt;a href=\"Dunmer\"&gt;Dunmer&lt;/a&gt; woman named &lt;a href=\"Katariah\"&gt;Katariah I&lt;/a&gt;, who succeeded him to the throne as a regent-dowager, until their son &lt;a href=\"Cassynder%20Septim\"&gt;Cassynder&lt;/a&gt; was old enough to rule.\nWhen Pelagius was just over a year old, Emperor &lt;a href=\"Antiochus%20Septim\"&gt;Antiochus Septim&lt;/a&gt; died and his daughter, &lt;a href=\"Kintyra%20Septim%20II\"&gt;Kintyra&lt;/a&gt;, assumed the throne to the acclaim of all. Kintyra II was Pelagius' cousin and an accomplished mystic and sorceress. Kintyra II's reign was usurped by her and Pelagius' cousin &lt;a href=\"Uriel%20III\"&gt;Uriel&lt;/a&gt;, by the power of his mother, &lt;a href=\"Potema%20Septim\"&gt;Potema&lt;/a&gt;, the so-called \"Wolf Queen of Solitude.\"\nBiography.\nEarly life during the &lt;a href=\"War%20of%20the%20Red%20Diamond\"&gt;War of the Red Diamond&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe man who would be &lt;a href=\"Emperor\"&gt;Emperor&lt;/a&gt; of all &lt;a href=\"Tamriel\"&gt;Tamriel&lt;/a&gt; was born Thoriz Pelagius Septim, a prince of the royal family of &lt;a href=\"Wayrest\"&gt;Wayrest&lt;/a&gt; in 3E 119 at the end of the glorious reign of his uncle, Antiochus I. Wayrest had been showered with much preference during the years before Pelagius' birth, for King Magnus was Antiochus' favorite brother.\nWhen Pelagius was just over a year old, Antiochus died and his daughter, Kintyra, assumed the throne to the acclaim of all. Kintrya II was Pelagius' cousin and an accomplished mystic and sorceress. Kintyra II's reign was usurped by her and Pelagius' cousin Uriel, by the power of his aunt Potema, the \"Wolf Queen of Solitude.\" The year after her coronation, Kintyra was trapped in &lt;a href=\"Glenpoint\"&gt;Glenpoint&lt;/a&gt;, and imprisoned in the &lt;a href=\"Imperial\"&gt;Imperial&lt;/a&gt; dungeons there.\nAll of Tamriel exploded into warfare as Prince Uriel took the throne as Uriel III, and &lt;a href=\"High%20Rock\"&gt;High Rock&lt;/a&gt;, because of the imprisoned Empress' presence there, was the location of some of the bloodiest battles. Pelagius' father, King Magnus, allied himself with his brother &lt;a href=\"Cephorus\"&gt;Cephorus&lt;/a&gt; against the usurper Emperor, and brought the wrath of Uriel III and Queen Potema down on Wayrest. Pelagius, his brothers and sisters, and his mother Utheilla fled to the &lt;a href=\"Isle%20of%20Balfiera\"&gt;Isle of Balfiera&lt;/a&gt;.\nAll who met Pelagius on the isle described him as a handsome, personable boy, interested in sport, &lt;a href=\"magic\"&gt;magic&lt;/a&gt;, and music. Even assuming diplomats' lack of candor, Pelagius seemed, if anything, a blessing to the future of the &lt;a href=\"Septim%20Dynasty\"&gt;Septim Dynasty&lt;/a&gt;.\nWhen Pelagius was eight, Cephorus defeated Uriel III at the &lt;a href=\"Battle%20of%20Ichidag\"&gt;Battle of Ichidag&lt;/a&gt; and proclaimed himself Emperor Cephorus I. For the next ten years his and Potema's armies clashed with one another. At the conclusion of the &lt;a href=\"Siege%20of%20Solitude\"&gt;Siege of Solitude&lt;/a&gt;, which ended with Potema's death and the end of the war, Cephorus placed his nephew on the throne of Solitude.\nKing of Solitude.\nAs King of &lt;a href=\"Solitude\"&gt;Solitude&lt;/a&gt;, Pelagius' eccentricities of behavior began to be noticeable. As a favorite nephew of the &lt;a href=\"Emperor\"&gt;Emperor&lt;/a&gt;, few diplomats to Solitude made critical commentary on Pelagius. For the first two years of his reign, Pelagius was at the very least noted for his alarming shifts in weight. Four months after taking the throne, a diplomat from &lt;a href=\"Ebonheart\"&gt;Ebonheart&lt;/a&gt; called Pelagius \"a hale and hearty soul with a heart so big, it widens his waist.\" Five months later, the visiting Princess of &lt;a href=\"Firsthold\"&gt;Firsthold&lt;/a&gt; wrote to her brother that \"the king gripped my hand and it felt like I was being clutched by a skeleton. Pelagius is greatly emaciated, indeed.\"\nCephorus died childless (as his children perished during the &lt;a href=\"War%20of%20the%20Red%20Diamond\"&gt;War of the Red Diamond&lt;/a&gt;), three years after the Siege of Solitude. As the only surviving sibling, Pelagius' father Magnus left the throne of &lt;a href=\"Wayrest\"&gt;Wayrest&lt;/a&gt; and took up residence in the &lt;a href=\"Imperial%20City\"&gt;Imperial City&lt;/a&gt; as the Emperor Magnus I. Magnus was elderly and Pelagius was his oldest living child, so the attention of &lt;a href=\"Tamriel\"&gt;Tamriel&lt;/a&gt; focused on Solitude. By this time, Pelagius' eccentricities were becoming infamous.\nThere are many legends about his acts as King of Solitude, but few well-documented cases exist. It is known that Pelagius locked the young princes and princesses of &lt;a href=\"Silvenar%20%28City%29\"&gt;Silvenar&lt;/a&gt; in his room with him, only releasing them when an unsigned declaration of war was slipped under the door. When he tore off his clothes during a speech he was giving at a local festival, his advisors apparently decided to watch him more carefully. On the orders of Magnus, Pelagius was married to the beautiful heiress of an ancient &lt;a href=\"Dunmer\"&gt;Dunmer&lt;/a&gt; noble family, &lt;a href=\"Katariah\"&gt;Katariah Ra'athim&lt;/a&gt;.\n&lt;a href=\"Nord\"&gt;Nord&lt;/a&gt;ic Kings who marry Dunmer seldom improve their popularity. There were two reasons for their union; Magnus was trying to cement relations with Ebonheart, where the Ra'athim clan hailed from. Ebonheart's neighbor, &lt;a href=\"Mournhold\"&gt;Mournhold&lt;/a&gt;, had been a historical ally of the Empire since the beginning, and the royal consort of Queen &lt;a href=\"Barenziah\"&gt;Barenziah&lt;/a&gt; had won many battles in the War of the Red Diamond. Ebonheart had a poorly kept secret of aiding Uriel III and Potema. The other reason for the marriage was more personal. Katariah was as shrewd a diplomat as she was beautiful. If any person was capable of hiding Pelagius' madness, it was she.\nAscent and death.\nOn the 8th of Second Seed, 3E 145, Magnus died quietly in his sleep. Jolethe, Pelagius' sister, took over the throne of &lt;a href=\"Solitude\"&gt;Solitude&lt;/a&gt;, and Pelagius rode with Katariah to the Imperial City to be crowned &lt;a href=\"Emperor\"&gt;Emperor&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"Tamriel\"&gt;Tamriel&lt;/a&gt;. It is said that Pelagius fainted when the crown was placed on his head, but Katariah held him up so only those closest to the thrones could see what had happened.\nPelagius Septim III never truly ruled Tamriel. Katariah and the Elder Council made all of the decisions and only tried to keep Pelagius from embarrassing them all.\nIt was said that when the &lt;a href=\"Argonian\"&gt;Argonian&lt;/a&gt; ambassador from &lt;a href=\"Blackrose\"&gt;Blackrose&lt;/a&gt; came to court, Pelagius insisted on speaking in all grunts and squeaks, as if that were the Argonian's natural language.\nIt is known that Pelagius was obsessed with cleanliness, and many guests reported waking to the noise of an early morning scrub-down of &lt;a href=\"White-Gold%20Tower\"&gt;White-Gold Tower&lt;/a&gt;. Pelagius, while inspecting the servants' work, suddenly defecated on the floor to give them something to do.\nWhen Pelagius began to bite and attack visitors to the White-Gold Tower, he was sent to a private asylum on the &lt;a href=\"Betony\"&gt;Isle of Betony&lt;/a&gt;. Pelagius was transferred to several other asylums, including asylums in &lt;a href=\"Valenwood\"&gt;Valenwood&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Torval\"&gt;Torval&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Black%20Marsh\"&gt;Black Marsh&lt;/a&gt;. During his stay in the asylum in Torval, Pelagius planned a ball.\nOn a warm night in &lt;a href=\"Sun%27s%20Dawn\"&gt;Sun's Dawn&lt;/a&gt; in his 34th year, Pelagius Septim III died after a brief fever in his cell at the Temple of &lt;a href=\"Kynareth\"&gt;Kynareth&lt;/a&gt; on Betony. Katariah reigned for another 46 years before passing the scepter onto the only child she had with Pelagius, &lt;a href=\"Cassynder%20Septim\"&gt;Cassynder&lt;/a&gt;.\nLegacy.\nAfter Pelagius' death, the asylum he was contained in was destroyed. However, a group known as the Apostles of Light transported each original stone to the &lt;a href=\"Shivering%20Isles\"&gt;Shivering Isles&lt;/a&gt;, where it was reconstructed and renamed &lt;a href=\"The%20Howling%20Halls\"&gt;The Howling Halls&lt;/a&gt;. Pelagius' ghost still haunts the Isles to this day. During the first days of the Fourth Era, &lt;a href=\"Hero%20of%20Kvatch\"&gt;Sheogorath's champion&lt;/a&gt; raided the Halls and wiped out the Apostles. They also discovered Pelagius' pelvis, the only surviving remains of the mad emperor.\nLater in the Fourth Era, the &lt;a href=\"Last%20Dragonborn\"&gt;Last Dragonborn&lt;/a&gt; was given &lt;a href=\"Pelagius%27%20Hip%20Bone\"&gt;Pelagius' Hip Bone&lt;/a&gt; during &lt;a href=\"The%20Mind%20of%20Madness\"&gt;Sheogorath's quest&lt;/a&gt;, where they had to cure Pelagius of his madness by entering his mind and to send him back to the Shivering Isles.\nPelagius' wild behavior has made him perversely dear to the province of his birth and death. The 2nd of Sun's Dawn, which may or may not be the anniversary of his death, is celebrated as the &lt;a href=\"Mad%20Pelagius\"&gt;Mad Pelagius&lt;/a&gt; Festival, a time when foolishness of all sorts is encouraged. And so, one of the least desirable Emperors in the history of the Septim dynasty has become one of the most famous.\nConversations.\nDuties of an Emperor.\nSheogorath: \"More tea, Pelly my dear?\"\nPelagius: \"Oh, I couldn't. It goes right through me. So many detractors and undesirables, naysayers, buffoons. My...My headsman hasn't slept in three days.\"\nSheogorath: \"You are far too hard on yourself, my dear, sweet, homicidally insane Pelagius. What would the people do without you? Dance? Sing? Smile? [laughter] Grow old? You are the best Septim that has ever ruled. Well, except for that Martin fellow, but he turned into a Dragon god, and that's hardly sporting. You know, I was there for that whole sordid affair. Marvelous time! Butterflies, blood, a Fox, a severed head... Oh, and the cheese! To die for.\"\nPelagius: \"Yes, yes, as you've said countless times before.\"\nSheogorath: \"Harumph! Well, if you're going to be like that, I think its best I take my leave. I said a good day to you, sir, I said good day!\"\nPelagius: \"Yes. Leave me to my ceaseless responsibilities and burdens.\""}

He succeeded his aunt, the &lt;a href=\"Empress%20Morihatha\"&gt;Empress Morihatha&lt;/a&gt;, who was assassinated in 3E 339. Pelagius' mother, &lt;a href=\"Eloisa%20Septim\"&gt;Eloisa&lt;/a&gt;, had died four years prior to his ascension, thus making the 25-year-old Pelagius the first in line for the &lt;a href=\"Septim%20Dynasty\"&gt;Septim&lt;/a&gt; throne.\nReign.\nPelagius Septim IV's rule was one of integration throughout Tamriel, continuing on the work of &lt;a href=\"Morihatha%20Septim\"&gt;Morihatha Septim&lt;/a&gt;;\u00a0but, despite his beneficial traits and patience, the progress he made was slow. This is largely because the kingdoms had been free of constraint for so long, even a benign influence was seen as odious. The eastern province of &lt;a href=\"Morrowind\"&gt;Morrowind&lt;/a&gt; still remained relatively alienated from the Empire, its customs differing strongly from the Empire's, and its rulers being largely unreceptive of the Empire's diplomacy. Closer to home, however, small kingdoms were gradually integrating further with the Empire and its culture. After Pelagius' 29-year reign, the Empire was more united than it had been for hundreds of years. Scholars agreed that the Empire had not seen such unity since the reign of &lt;a href=\"Uriel%20Septim%20I\"&gt;Uriel Septim I&lt;/a&gt;.\nDeath.\nPelagius died\u00a0in 3E 368, at the age of 54, of internal problems.

To the ballista!\"\nOnce the Maormer borders are defeated, a huge &lt;a href=\"sea%20serpent\"&gt;sea serpent&lt;/a&gt; jumps out of the water. The Vestige needs to use the ballistas to shoot it. It will spit poison and attack the deck, but its attacks are fairly predictable. More Sea Vipers will appear on deck, though, as the Vestige is trying to defeat the sea serpent. There are two &lt;a href=\"Aldmeri%20Dominion%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Dominion&lt;/a&gt; Soldiers who will help the Vestige defeat the Sea Vipers.\nOnce all the boarders have been defeated, the Vestige travels through the portal at the south end of the deck to kill Pelidil. He is an extremely tough opponent. He uses Area of Effect attacks and fireballs that follow the Vestige, but that can be dodged. Sea Vipers may also appear while fighting him. The orb that is floating around him does not seem to do anything and cannot be targeted.\nProwler Crew Member: \"Haha! The Serpent-Slayer! You saved the day!\"\nOnce Pelidil is dead, the Vestige travels back through the portal and tells Captain Jimila that Pelidil is dead. They travel back to Seaside Sanctuary, but Jimila is not coming ashore. She will stay aboard and celebrate with her crew. She gives the Vestige\u00a0their reward."}

{"id": "5304", "revid": "25356303", "url": "https://elderscrolls.fandom.com/wiki?curid=5304", "title": "Pelinal Whitestrake", "text": "Pelinal Whitestrake, renowned as \"&lt;a href=\"Divine%20Crusader\"&gt;The Divine Crusader&lt;/a&gt;,\" was an immortal hero, legendary warrior, sorcerer, king, and crusader who fought as champion of the Slave-queen, &lt;a href=\"Alessia\"&gt;Alessia&lt;/a&gt;.\nOrigin.\nIt is said that Pelinal emerged into &lt;a href=\"Nirn\"&gt;Nirn&lt;/a&gt; like a &lt;a href=\"Padomaic\"&gt;Padomaic&lt;/a&gt;, carried by &lt;a href=\"Sithis\"&gt;Sithis&lt;/a&gt; and all other forces of change. Described by &lt;a href=\"Morihaus\"&gt;Morihaus&lt;/a&gt; as an \"ada\" or \"spirit\", Pelinal plays the same role as a long line of avatars sent by &lt;a href=\"Shezarr\"&gt;Shezarr&lt;/a&gt; to champion the cause of mankind and stop the Elves from destroying them. Pelinal, however, is an exception, as he exhibits significant bonds to &lt;a href=\"Akatosh\"&gt;Akatosh&lt;/a&gt; as well, as he had the &lt;a href=\"Amulet%20of%20Kings\"&gt;Amulet of Kings&lt;/a&gt; in his chest in place of a heart.\nHistory.\nMerethic Era.\nPelinal was said to have first appeared in the late &lt;a href=\"Merethic%20Era\"&gt;Merethic Era&lt;/a&gt; under various aliases where he wandered &lt;a href=\"Tamriel\"&gt;Tamriel&lt;/a&gt; gathering armies, conquering lands, ruling, then abandoning his kingdoms to wander again.\nFirst Era.\nAlessian Rebellion.\nBefore Alessia started her rebellion in &lt;a href=\"1E%20242\"&gt;1E 242&lt;/a&gt;, Pelinal had already begun fighting against the &lt;a href=\"Ayleid\"&gt;Ayleid&lt;/a&gt; armies in &lt;a href=\"Cyrodiil\"&gt;Cyrodiil&lt;/a&gt;. When he heard of her defiance against the Elves, he came to her at a rebel camp holding his mace and sword, both encrusted with smashed Elven intestines, as well as the sacred Ayleid symbols of feathers and pearls, and joined her cause for freedom. As such, Pelinal became champion of Alessia alongside her &lt;a href=\"demiprince\"&gt;demiprince&lt;/a&gt; lover &lt;a href=\"Morihaus\"&gt;Morihaus&lt;/a&gt;, Breath-of-Kyne.\nCrusade.\nIn the days of the Rebellion, Pelinal was the enemy of all Elves that lived in Cyrodiil. He did not participate in much traditional warfare, but rather targeted the higher-ranking members of Ayleid culture by challenging them to prearranged duels to play to their pride. One of his more famous duels was with &lt;a href=\"Haromir%20of%20Copper%20and%20Tea\"&gt;Haromir of Copper and Tea&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;a href=\"Sancre%20Tor\"&gt;duel at the Tor&lt;/a&gt;, where Pelinal \"ate his neck-veins while screaming praise to &lt;a href=\"Reman\"&gt;Reman&lt;/a&gt;, a name that no one knew yet.\"\nPelinal went on to slay many more Elven rulers in similar duels. He faced another king, &lt;a href=\"Gordhaur%20the%20Shaper\"&gt;Gordhaur the Shaper&lt;/a&gt;, and was said to have \"smashed his head upon the goat-faced altar of &lt;a href=\"Ninendava%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;Ninendava&lt;/a&gt;,\" another Ayleid city. Pelinal then cursed Gordhaur's body so that the Ayleid sorcerers would be unable to reanimate their king. Later that season, Pelinal slew the Fire King &lt;a href=\"Hadhuul\"&gt;Hadhuul&lt;/a&gt; at the Ayleid city of &lt;a href=\"Ceya-Tar\"&gt;Ceya-Tar&lt;/a&gt;, where his spearmen suffered their first defeat at the hands of the Crusader.\nIn one year Pelinal drove the Ayleid armies past the &lt;a href=\"Niben\"&gt;Niben&lt;/a&gt; and claimed all the eastern lands for Alessia's forces. He freed the slaves of &lt;a href=\"Vahtacen\"&gt;Vahtacen&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Thousand-Strong%20of%20Sedor\"&gt;Thousand-Strong of Sedor&lt;/a&gt;, a human tribe who had been enslaved by the Ayleids at &lt;a href=\"Sedor%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;Sedor&lt;/a&gt;. Nothing could stop his march and when he claimed northern &lt;a href=\"Cyrodiil\"&gt;Cyrodiil&lt;/a&gt;, Alessia sent messengers to the Nords of &lt;a href=\"Skyrim\"&gt;Skyrim&lt;/a&gt;, asking for their aid. When the Nords saw the Crusader standing at the bridge of Heldon, after his white hair had become so stained with blood that it turned brown, they praised him and said that their patron god &lt;a href=\"Shor\"&gt;Shor&lt;/a&gt; had returned. Pelinal did not take kindly to that and spat at their feet for profaning that name. Nonetheless, Whitestrake led them west to drive the Ayleids inwards Cyrodiil.\nMadness.\nWhen &lt;a href=\"Huna\"&gt;Huna&lt;/a&gt;, a hoplite that Pelinal had trained personally and cared for deeply, was killed by &lt;a href=\"Celethelel%20the%20Singer\"&gt;Celethelel the Singer&lt;/a&gt;, Pelinal Whitestrake went on his first Madness. He killed without purpose and brought destruction from the cities of &lt;a href=\"Narlemae\"&gt;Narlemae&lt;/a&gt; to &lt;a href=\"Celediil\"&gt;Celediil&lt;/a&gt;, and destroyed those lands in a rampage, killing any and all who stood in his way. Alessia would have to pray to the Gods for their help, and they reached down to the earth and calmed Pelinal until he stopped his mindless rampage and regained his composure.\nFifd of New Teed said that Whitestrake had no heart under his armor, only the \"rage of a mindless dragon.\" Pelinal was angered by this and would kill anyone who spoke according to the knowledge and logic of the gods, except for Alessia because she \"acted rather than talked, as language without effort is a dead witness.\" When his men heard him say these things, they went silent and angered him. He ran into the rain, laughing madly and swinging his sword, while screaming \"\"O &lt;a href=\"Akatosh\"&gt;Aka&lt;/a&gt;, for our shared madness I do this! I watch you watching me watching back! Umaril dares call us out, for that is how we made him!\"\"\nGarid of the Men-of-Ge once witnessed Pelinal's madness in battle. When he and the Crusader had a drink together he asked what it felt like. Pelinal described it as \"When the dream no longer needs its dreamer.\"\nBattle with Umaril.\nIn &lt;a href=\"1E%20243\"&gt;1E 243&lt;/a&gt;, towards the end of the war, rebellion forces marched back south and east. When they came closer to &lt;a href=\"White-Gold%20Tower\"&gt;White-Gold Tower&lt;/a&gt;, the demigod half-Elf &lt;a href=\"Umaril%20the%20Unfeathered\"&gt;Umaril the Unfeathered&lt;/a&gt; challenged Pelinal to a duel. At her War Council, the Alessian armies and all of the Nords grew anxious and fearful at the foresight of storming the White-Gold Tower and facing Umaril and his soldiers. Because of their hesitation, Alessia herself counseled delay. Their hesitation made Pelinal furious and made names of his own allies, calling them cowards. He proceeded to insult Umaril in his anger. Outraged and acting on his instinct rather than thought, he went in alone to confront Umaril.\nUpon his arrival in the city, Umaril revealed that he had tricked the Crusader and weakened Pelinal by sending in soldiers who he had been saving for this moment, knowing that they would be killed easily by the Crusader. After his battle with Umaril's servants, Pelinal became surrounded by the last Ayleid sorcerer-kings and their minions, who were probably summoned &lt;a href=\"Aurorans\"&gt;Aurorans&lt;/a&gt; and other &lt;a href=\"Daedra\"&gt;Daedra&lt;/a&gt;. Bleeding in battle for the first time, Pelinal smashed the floor with his weapon in a rage, sending pieces of rock flying in all directions. As his attackers withdrew in fear of their opponent, Pelinal screamed for Umaril to reveal himself and face the Crusader in combat.\nIt was only after Whitestrake was weakened and badly wounded that Umaril came down to fight him. Both fighters were equally matched, and they injured each other severely. Ultimately, Pelinal broke off the Elf-king's wings, finally killing him and ending the Ayleid enslavement of humans. As his enemy died, Whitestrake yet laughed about the ugliness of Umaril's angel-shaped helmet and recklessly insulted the ancestry of the half-Elf and anyone else who was descended from &lt;a href=\"Ehlnofey\"&gt;Old Ehlnofey&lt;/a&gt;. Enraged by his remarks about their heritage, the sorcerer-kings returned and overwhelmed the weakened Crusader, killing him.\nPelinal's death.\nPelinal Whitestrake was brutally executed by the remaining Ayleid kings. They surrounded him with their weapons and cut him into eight pieces; a symbolic number in Ayleid culture. Alessia and her council were woken by Pelinal's dying scream and ordered an immediate attack on the city the next morning. The soldiers stormed the walls, looking for more Ayleids to kill, but Pelinal had killed them all except the ones that were already fleeing for their lives.\nFearing for the life of his friend, Morihaus shook the whole tower by bashing it with his horns while he tried to reach Pelinal, but he was too late. In the tower, he found the head of Pelinal Whitestrake, which the kings had left to prove that they had undone one of the cornerstones of the human rebellion. Strangely, Pelinal's head was still alive and greeted Morihaus upon seeing him, much to the shock of the Man-Bull. The two friends spoke for a long time, reportedly about regret and things of which even Alessia herself would never hear the truth.\nAs the end of his life approached, Pelinal, through forces unknown, realised at the last moment that Umaril survived: \"Beware, Morihaus, beware! With the foresight of death I know now that my foe yet lives, bitter knowledge to take to my grave. Better that I had died believing myself the victor. Although cast beyond the doors of night, he will return. Be vigilant! I can no longer shield the host of Men from Umaril's retribution.\" After this last warning the famous Pelinal Whitestrake died.\nResurrection.\nStrangely it appears that Pelinal was present in &lt;a href=\"1E%20266\"&gt;1E 266&lt;/a&gt; at Empress Alessia's deathbed, although he was killed by the Elvish Kings earlier.\nAccording to this fragment, Pelinal found salvation after his death, freed of his madness, and now acted as a guardian to bring Alessia's soul to the afterlife. His ghost also appeared to the &lt;a href=\"Hero%20of%20Kvatch\"&gt;Hero of Kvatch&lt;/a&gt;, the Second Divine Crusader, in order to help them defeat Umaril in the Third Era.\nLegacy.\nPelinal Whitestrake freed Cyrodiil from the Ayleid oppressors and ushered in a new era of peace and freedom. Because of his efforts Alessia could establish the &lt;a href=\"First%20Era\"&gt;First Empire&lt;/a&gt;. His reputation varies widely. Among , he is a hero who helped free Cyrodiil from oppression. Among &lt;a href=\"Mer\"&gt;Mer&lt;/a&gt;, he is the vicious warlord who led the Elven Pogrom. He is also reviled by the &lt;a href=\"Khajiit\"&gt;Khajiit&lt;/a&gt;, because he mistook them for another type of elf and killed many of them before he realized his mistake.\nIn &lt;a href=\"3E%20111\"&gt;3E 111&lt;/a&gt; the Order of the Knights of the Nine was founded with the intent of recovering the lost armor of Pelinal Whitestrake, the &lt;a href=\"Relics%20of%20the%20Crusader%20%28Knights%20of%20the%20Nine%29\"&gt;Relics of the Crusader&lt;/a&gt;. Their reputation was established when the first knights defeated the &lt;a href=\"Wyrm%20of%20Elynglenn\"&gt;Wyrm of Elynglenn&lt;/a&gt; to recover the &lt;a href=\"Cuirass%20of%20the%20Crusader\"&gt;Cuirass of the Crusader&lt;/a&gt;. The following period was the Order's peak and three more Relics were discovered. However, in &lt;a href=\"3E%20121\"&gt;3E 121&lt;/a&gt;, during the &lt;a href=\"War%20of%20the%20Red%20Diamond\"&gt;War of the Red Diamond&lt;/a&gt;, the order was split and the Relics were lost again.\n\"Hail Knight! You seek my Relics with a worthy heart! Your prayers have woken me from my endless dream. Or perhaps you have entered my dream, and I still sleep. I think others have sometimes spoken to me, others like you, but my memory is doubtful. Perhaps the others came after you. Your need must be great for the gods to allow us to speak. Has Umaril the Accursed found a way back? The foulest of a foul race. A thousand curses upon his unholy name! I thought I'd won. But I should have known. The Slavemasters are a cunning breed. Umaril found a way to cheat death, as I could not. If you would seek for my Relics, I know little that can help you. All that has passed since my death is like mist that my mind cannot take hold of. My friends built a shrine upon the site of my death, where the Elves tormented me in a final act of revenge. I can show you where it once stood. Perhaps it is there still. Fare thee well, sir knight. May the gods grant you to destroy Umaril utterly, as I failed to do.\"\nFollowing Daedric attacks on chapels all across Cyrodiil in &lt;a href=\"3E%20433\"&gt;3E 433&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"Hero%20of%20Kvatch\"&gt;Hero of Kvatch&lt;/a&gt; was warned by &lt;a href=\"The%20Prophet%20%28Knights%20of%20the%20Nine%29\"&gt;a Prophet&lt;/a&gt; of the fact that &lt;a href=\"Umaril\"&gt;Umaril&lt;/a&gt; had finally returned to Cyrodiil to unleash his vengeance on humanity for destroying him and his people thousands of years before. After a pilgrimage the Hero received a vision of Pelinal Whitestrake who put them on the path of reconstituting the Order of the Knights of the Nine and reuniting the Crusader's Relics, which were needed to destroy Umaril the Unfeathered forever.\nName.\nAlthough his true name is never known, Pelinal Whitestrake was referred to in many different ways. Records state that he lived under various aliases, such as &lt;a href=\"Ysmir\"&gt;Ysmir&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Wulfharth\"&gt;Wulfharth&lt;/a&gt;, Harrald Hairy Breeks and Hans the Fox. His first name, Pelinal, is a corruption of the name Pelin-El, which means \"Star-Made Knight\". He took the name, despite it being &lt;a href=\"Mer\"&gt;Elven&lt;/a&gt;. His last name, Whitestrake, was attributed to him due to his snow white hair. During the Alessian Rebellion, he was known as Pelinal Insurgent, Pelinal the Bloody, Pelinal the Blamer and Pelinal the Third.\nThis last moniker, 'Pelinal the Third' suggests a relationship with other supernatural champions of mankind \u2014 Harrald Hairy-Breeks and Hans the Fox. Altmeri sources suggest that he is one and the same, although it is unlikely that this is the whole story, given his alien characteristics and persona, and the fact that he cannot easily be described as a king or sorcerer. Another theory on his title of \"the Third\" is that it comes from him being the third vision received by &lt;a href=\"Saint%20Alessia\"&gt;Saint Alessia&lt;/a&gt; in her prayers to the gods for mankind's freedom from the Ayleids. Because of his rather vicious crusades against the Ayleids, Pelinal is often referred to as the Divine Crusader by humans.\nPersonality.\nPelinal Whitestrake had a very distinct personality compared to other Tamrielic figures. He was known to be very quick to anger, perceiving even the slightest comment as an insult. He would act on instinct and would rarely think about his actions, as shown when he began to mock the Ayleids for their ancestry, leading to his dismemberment at their hands. Another example is when he slaughtered thousands of Khajiit, thinking they were a species of elf. Pelinal was also known to be quite mad, embarking on endeavors of rage and anger, killing any who stood in his path and even destroying the land itself. This madness may have also led him to despise the gods, killing any who \"spoke according to their logic.\" Pelinal was known to be so defiant and short-tempered that he reportedly felt &lt;a href=\"Akatosh\"&gt;Akatosh&lt;/a&gt; looking down on him and simply stared back at him."}

Pell's Gate is one of the few settlements located along the Heartlands of Cyrodiil, the town was possibly named after &lt;a href=\"Pelinal%20Whitestrake\"&gt;Pelinal Whitestrake&lt;/a&gt;, whose name can be shortened to Pell.\nDescription.\nGeography.\nAs mentioned before, Pell's Gate is located on the Red Ring Road, which is a major route that extends to the other roads in Cyrodiil and goes around the &lt;a href=\"Imperial%20City\"&gt;Imperial City&lt;/a&gt;. Despite this, Pell's Gate is a small community that seems isolated from the Imperial City metropolis. Pell's Gate has three houses, one of which is the &lt;a href=\"The%20Sleeping%20Mare\"&gt;Sleeping Mare Inn&lt;/a&gt;, which is one of the town's sources of income.

It was because of the ongoing war, across the countryside, several different gangs began to spring up and pillage the innocent settlements located from as far as the &lt;a href=\"Valus%20Mountains\"&gt;Valus Mountains&lt;/a&gt; to the &lt;a href=\"Great%20Forest\"&gt;Great Forest&lt;/a&gt;, and to the &lt;a href=\"Nibenay%20Valley\"&gt;Nibenay Valley&lt;/a&gt;, Pell's Gate was no exception. The village was sacked by a group of raiders called the &lt;a href=\"Homestead%20Bandits\"&gt;Homestead Bandits&lt;/a&gt; that burned down the few houses and stolen the different resources in town. The bandits came from the &lt;a href=\"Homestead%20Ruins\"&gt;Homestead Ruins&lt;/a&gt; nearby. It is unknown what happened to the villagers, they were either evacuated to the &lt;a href=\"Imperial%20City\"&gt;Imperial City&lt;/a&gt; or taken in by the &lt;a href=\"First%20Aldmeri%20Dominion\"&gt;First Aldmeri Dominion&lt;/a&gt;, since the town was considered in &lt;a href=\"Dominion%20Territory\"&gt;Dominion Territory&lt;/a&gt;. If it was the former, then they were either killed or lost in &lt;a href=\"Molag%20Bal\"&gt;Molag Bal&lt;/a&gt;'s incursion of the Imperial City.\n&lt;a href=\"Third%20Era\"&gt;Third Era&lt;/a&gt;.\nDuring the &lt;a href=\"Oblivion%20Crisis\"&gt;Oblivion Crisis&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"3E%20433\"&gt;3E 433&lt;/a&gt;, the town of Pell's Gate was flourishing amidst the third era but was affected by the Oblivion Crisis. Farmers and local workers of Pell's Gate were recruited to fight against the &lt;a href=\"Daedra\"&gt;Daedra&lt;/a&gt; at the &lt;a href=\"Second%20Battle%20of%20Ione%27s%20Oblivion%20Gate\"&gt;Second Battle of Ione's Oblivion Gate&lt;/a&gt; by Captain &lt;a href=\"Tertius%20Ione\"&gt;Tertius Ione&lt;/a&gt;. Captain Ione's forces were shoddy at best and consisted of the farmers of Pell's Gate and survivors of the initial attack. Ione learned that a &lt;a href=\"Hero%20of%20Kvatch\"&gt;warrior&lt;/a&gt; was able to travel to the &lt;a href=\"Oblivion%20Gate\"&gt;Oblivion Gate&lt;/a&gt; and destroy it from inside. Ione used this knowledge to destroy the Gate and advance the Empire's forces on the Crisis. Ione was revered across the Empire for his bravery and the town of &lt;a href=\"Ione\"&gt;Ione&lt;/a&gt; grew after Tertius' victory."}

It once was following a\u00a0&lt;a href=\"Thalmor\"&gt;Thalmor&lt;/a&gt;-supported\u00a0&lt;a href=\"Void%20Nights\"&gt;coup d'\u00e9tat&lt;/a&gt;. Pelletine now exists as a client state of the\u00a0&lt;a href=\"Third%20Aldmeri%20Dominion\"&gt;Third Aldmeri Dominion&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe southern regions of Elsweyr are dominated by dense jungles and woodland, similar to that of neighbouring &lt;a href=\"Valenwood\"&gt;Valenwood&lt;/a&gt;, the climate of which has influenced the culture of the Pelletine &lt;a href=\"Khajiit\"&gt;Khajiit&lt;/a&gt; as much as that of their counterparts to the North. It is presumed that the head of state in Pelletine remains to be that of the religious Khajiit\u00a0&lt;a href=\"Mane\"&gt;Mane&lt;/a&gt;, who\u00a0resides in the city of\u00a0&lt;a href=\"Torval\"&gt;Torval&lt;/a&gt;. The society of Pelletine itself seems to be deeply involved in the process of trade and the production of the hallucinogenic &lt;a href=\"Moon%20Sugar\"&gt;moon sugars&lt;/a&gt;, which hold cultural and religious value in Khajiiti society. The aristocracy of Pelletine is known to own the vast groves and plantations devoted to growing this lucrative and often controversial\u00a0drug.\nHistory.\nAfter the &lt;a href=\"Oblivion%20Crisis\"&gt;Oblivion Crisis&lt;/a&gt;, the province of Elsweyr was damaged as a result of &lt;a href=\"Daedra\"&gt;Daedra&lt;/a&gt; attacks, but still a part of the &lt;a href=\"Mede%20Empire\"&gt;Empire&lt;/a&gt;. Once the two moons, &lt;a href=\"Masser\"&gt;Masser&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Secunda\"&gt;Secunda&lt;/a&gt;, disappeared during the &lt;a href=\"Void%20Nights\"&gt;Void Nights&lt;/a&gt;, the province was thrown into chaos, as a large part of &lt;a href=\"Khajiit\"&gt;Khajiit&lt;/a&gt;i culture revolves around the interpretation of the lunar cycle. After two years, the moons returned, with the &lt;a href=\"Thalmor%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Thalmor&lt;/a&gt; claiming to have restored them with Dawn Magicks, and were able to gain a large amount of influence over Elsweyr. As a result, the Empire was unable to respond to a coup in &lt;a href=\"4E%20115\"&gt;4E 115&lt;/a&gt; which dissolved the Elsweyr Confederacy, recreating Anequina and Pelletine."}

Their primary task is protecting the Emperor, and as such, are considered elite bodyguards. The Penitus Oculatus uses warriors, archers, and mages in their line of duty.\nRecruitment.\nThe Penitus Oculatus approaches young and bright people when they go out to recruit, and can be provided with advice by guardsmen in Cyrodiil. New potential recruits are sent an Imperial invitation by the organization, following which they have to perform two tasks. One of these tasks is assassinating someone. These targets are ordered to be killed by the authority of the Emperor, and while recruits are not told why their target had to die, since their duty is not to think but to obey, they are ensured it is for a justified reason. The second task is being able to convince the Intendant that the new recruit is ready for the duties within the Penitus Oculatus. Those who successfully join the Penitus Oculatus can have their training be primarily focused on one specific subject, such as the Thalmor. Agents of the Penitus Oculatus study within the &lt;a href=\"White-Gold%20Tower\"&gt;White-Gold Tower&lt;/a&gt;, where they have a private library, to which only the Penitus Oculatus, and a select few others, such as the Prime Minister, have access.\nUpon being accepted into the Penitus Oculatus, new recruits are provided with their documents by the Intendant of the organization.\nDuties.\nPenitus Oculatus Agents serve a number of tasks. They are tasked with discovering spies within the Empire through tact and their mind, but they can also be tasked with stealing, poisoning, stabbing, injuring, or murdering targets. Inspectors are involved with investigating crime scenes, such as when someone related to the Imperial family is kidnapped. They are also able to send out scouts to investigate events or places that might threaten the Empire.\nAnother part of their duty is ensuring the safety of the Emperor, the prince, and other members related to the Imperial family. Even so, members of the Imperial family can order the Penitus Oculatus to cease their attempts of getting them to safety, to which the Penitus Oculatus must obey.\nHistory.\nFollowing the Oblivion Crisis, the Blades ceased working with the Empire directly, as they were not an arm of the Imperial Government. As such, the Penitus Oculatus was founded to replace the duties of the Blades.\nIn 4E 28, the Penitus Oculatus was tasked with dealing with &lt;a href=\"Julius%20Primus\"&gt;Julius Primus&lt;/a&gt;, a self-proclaimed new King of Worms, who had been an expert at hiding, and was a nuisance to the Empire. The Penitus Oculatus killed him and hid his body in a hidden enclave underneath the ministery.\n&lt;a href=\"Umbriel%20Crisis\"&gt;Umbriel Crisis&lt;/a&gt;.\nDuring the Umbriel Crisis, the Penitus Oculatus saw some action. Inspector Colin, a relatively new member of the organization, was involved with multiple deeds. His first assignment involved planting false intelligence for the Minister of War and trace it. Through the usage of a Penitus Oculatus agent in a Thalmor nest, it became clear the intelligence arrived there. It was then easily traced back to a mid-level official who was providing the information to a person who turned out to be a Thalmor sympathizer. Rather than arrest or murder the person responsible, however, it was decided to leave the leak in place due to its potential value.\nFollowing the capture of heir &lt;a href=\"Attrebus%20Mede\"&gt;Attrebus Mede&lt;/a&gt;, a Penitus Oculatus unit, alongside royal guardsmen, were sent out to investigate the site where the prince was last seen. The majority of the bodyguards of the prince had been murdered through the usage of arrows, though other bodies were torn apart. The Penitus Oculatus agents who were sent to the scene were under the command of Inspector &lt;a href=\"Colin\"&gt;Colin&lt;/a&gt;. Evidence at the scene pointed to &lt;a href=\"The%20Natives\"&gt;the Natives&lt;/a&gt;, a group of insurgents from &lt;a href=\"County%20Skingrad\"&gt;County Skingrad&lt;/a&gt;, being responsible for the attack, as arrows in their style alongside beheadings which the insurgents took part of, being noticed at the site. When the supposed body of the prince was found, however, Inspector Colin became suspicious. The body was beheaded, and largely burned with only scraps of clothing being attached to it, alongside a large ring. Colin considered this too convenient, and expected the prince to still be alive. He thought it'd make sense for the Natives to take the head of the prince, but didn't understand why they would have left his signature ring in place.\nSometime later, Colin had to report to the &lt;a href=\"Titus%20Mede%20I\"&gt;Emperor&lt;/a&gt; himself. During this conversation, Colin made clear that he believed the prince was still alive, and that the Natives were not involved in the massacre. The Emperor was suspicious at first since the Natives were vicious, as well as both funded and supplied by the Thalmor. Colin countered this argument by stating he did not believe the murder of the prince advanced the aims of the Thalmor. Administrator Vel of the Penitus Oculatus questioned Colin's claims, since he had only been on employ for a month, but Colin responded by pointing out the focus of his training was the Thalmor. The two held a short discussion in which the goal of the Thalmor was made clear by Colin; the pacification and purification of Tamriel, and why he did not see the connection to the murder of the prince in it. The Emperor would eventually agree with Colin that the body was not the one belonging to Attrebus, before he left the area, but due to Colin's aggressive response against Administrator Vel, he would end up being reassigned. Still, Colin continued to work on the Attrebus case, and chased the person who last spoke to &lt;a href=\"Gulan\"&gt;Gulan&lt;/a&gt;, the member of Attrebus Mede's personal guard who was tasked with reporting back to the Emperor. The person was an assistant to the minister, and was known as &lt;a href=\"Letine%20Arese\"&gt;Letine Arese&lt;/a&gt;. Attrebus would chase her through the Imperial City via the shadows, and eavesdrop on a conversation she held with a mercenary assigned to murder Attrebus. Here it became clear that the prince was still alive, as a courier had been seen by Letine reporting to the Emperor regarding the matter. Shortly afterwards, Letine accused the mercenary of being little more than a thug, following which the men of the mercenary entered the room, and a loud shrieking noise began. Colin escaped, now with the knowledge that the core of the Empire was rotten and only he seemed to care. The Inspector left the scene, wondering if Letine was working on her own, or if she was part of a bigger group.\nColin would then one day wake up and get captured by an &lt;a href=\"Argonian\"&gt;Argonian&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Bosmer\"&gt;Bosmer&lt;/a&gt; under the employ of Letine, as she had become aware that Colin was spying on her. She made Colin aware that the ambush on Prince Attrebus was planned by minister &lt;a href=\"Hierem\"&gt;Hierem&lt;/a&gt;, of who she was the assistant at the command of the Emperor himself, as Letine was part of the Emperor's inner circle. Letine believed Colin and herself shared a common goal; discovering why Hierem wanted Prince Attrebus dead, and so the two agreed to collaborate. While this unofficial assignment was ongoing, however, the Penitus Oculatus had become aware of the Flying City of &lt;a href=\"Umbriel\"&gt;Umbriel&lt;/a&gt;, and assumed it was somehow linked to the Thalmor as they must have been up to something. Colin did not see a connection between Umbriel and the Thalmor, but did agree the Thalmor was trying to harm the Empire in other ways, actively harassing refugee comunnities in &lt;a href=\"Sentinel\"&gt;Sentinel&lt;/a&gt; and on the &lt;a href=\"Isle%20of%20Balfiera\"&gt;Isle of Balfiera&lt;/a&gt;, with the former being often struck by murders which were presumed to have been performed by Thalmor agents, as all of the victims were either of mixed blood or had certain connections which the &lt;a href=\"Third%20Aldmeri%20Dominion\"&gt;Dominion&lt;/a&gt; disproved of. Within &lt;a href=\"Valenwood\"&gt;Valenwood&lt;/a&gt; the situation was even worse, as the local rebellions which were supplied by the Penitus Oculatus no longer reliably received said supplies. Sixty rebels, alongside four Penitus Oculatus agents were executed, and a leak was presumed to have been the cause. At the same time, Penitus Oculatus scouts confirmed the common rumors regarding the Flying City being from Oblivion, inhabited by strange creatures, which destroyed everything it passed and was followed by an army of the dead. The scouts would also discover that, while the track of the Flying City was from &lt;a href=\"Lilmoth\"&gt;Lilmoth&lt;/a&gt; to &lt;a href=\"Vvardenfell\"&gt;Vvardenfell&lt;/a&gt;, both the cities of &lt;a href=\"Gideon\"&gt;Gideon&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Stormhold\"&gt;Stormhold&lt;/a&gt; had also been overrun by the undead, despite neither being on the track between Lilmoth and Vvardenfell. This made the organization aware that the undead army of Umbriel could go far away from its creator, and with a reported army of undead having entered eastern Cyrodiil, some suspicion was made regarding the Thalmor. &lt;a href=\"Intendant%20Marall\"&gt;Intendant Marall&lt;/a&gt; elaborated on this by pointing out how, while Cyrodiil is busy fighting an undead army in the east, the Dominion would have the perfect chance to strike from the west or up the &lt;a href=\"Niben\"&gt;Niben&lt;/a&gt;. Colin still pointed out he had not encountered anything suggesting the Thalmor were aware of these events, to which Marall elaborated again. Both &lt;a href=\"The%20Synod\"&gt;The Synod&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"The%20College%20of%20Whispers\"&gt;The College of Whispers&lt;/a&gt; had agreed that Umbriel had arrived on &lt;a href=\"Tamriel\"&gt;Tamriel&lt;/a&gt; through the aid of some power on Tamriel itself. Because of this magical connection, the Thalmor were accused. Colin agreed somewhat to this notion, but still believed that, rather than attack the Empire, the Dominion would sooner use the Umbriel Crisis as a means to consolidate their hold over Valenwood, as he was aware the Dominion had a plan laid out over decades. As such, Colin suggested the &lt;a href=\"An-Xileel\"&gt;An-Xileel&lt;/a&gt; might have information on the event, as Umbriel first appeared in Black Marsh. While the reports of the Synod and College of Whispers, as well as those made on foot in Argonia, were largely centered around the size of Umbriel, alongside the massacre at Gideon and Stormhold, Colin decided to look into what little the Penitus Oculatus knew of the An-Xileel itself, and discovered some interesting information, namely, nearly every report regarding Black Marsh had been censored by Minister Hierem's office.\nColin would share this information with Letine, who was not surprised, as Hierem had made a secret trip to Black Marsh the previous year with the excuse of negotiating with the An-Xileel leaders, following which he would have had anything that suggested his presence there be removed. What did surprise her, however, was the fact that Hierem had also ordered the censorship of recent report regarding the Flying City, and Colin presumed it was connected to the attempted murder on Prince Attrebus. Because of this, Colin assumed that it had also been Hierem who summoned Umbriel to Tamriel, through some bargain with &lt;a href=\"Vuhon\"&gt;the lord&lt;/a&gt; of the Flying City. Letine Arese pointed out that it would be difficult to obtain the uncensored reports as those would be kept in Hierem's private quarters, if they were kept at all. Because of this, Colin asked if anyone joined Hierem during his journey to Black Marsh the previous year, which was the case. Delia Huerc was the person who had come with Hierem to Black Marsh, but had died following their return. The official report stated it was due to an illness, but due to recent discoveries, both Letine and Colin doubted the official report.\nBecause of this, Colin would locate and infiltrate the house of Delia. Here, after dealing with a ghost-like opponent, Colin discovered the journal of the &lt;a href=\"Redguard\"&gt;Redguard&lt;/a&gt;. The journal would explain that Delia had been led to believe that Hierem wanted to make a deal with the An-Xileel against the Thalmor, and that Hierem would become involved with a ritual at the &lt;a href=\"Hist%20Tree\"&gt;City Tree&lt;/a&gt; of Lilmoth. The An-Xileel were chanting to the tree, and Hierem would eventually add his voice to theirs, while at the same time performing some minor sorcery and repeating the name \"Umbriel\" many times. Delia would die the following day following food poisoning. While Colin was reading this information, he was also keeping an eye on the house of Letine, noticed a &lt;a href=\"Dark%20Brotherhood\"&gt;Dark Brotherhood&lt;/a&gt; assassin was waiting outside of it, and decided to break in to confront the threat. Within the house, another assassin was found, the former being killed by Colin, while the latter was slain by an atrnoach of Delia. This attempted assassination was evidence that someone, possibly Hierem himself, wanted Delia dead. Colin would later report the new information to the Emperor directly, and be tasked with the Emperor to find evidence that the &lt;a href=\"Elder%20Council\"&gt;Elder Council&lt;/a&gt; could not argue with. Due to the Emperor's own suspicions regarding Hierem, he provided Colin with the key to his office to continue his research.\nNew research would be done in the library of the Penitus Oculatus, where Colin worked alongside &lt;a href=\"Altmer\"&gt;Altmer&lt;/a&gt; colleague Professor Aronil. Aronil had asked Colin why he was researching into topics unrelated to his current assignment, to which Colin replied by explaining the story. Aronil provided Colin with a book which detailed the spirit which had attacked Colin while obtaining the journal of Delia, and elaborated that the last person to touch the book had been minister Hierem. Armed with this knowledge, Colin decided to hide Arese in a hidden enclave underneath the ministery. With Arese hidden, Colin went to the office of Hierem to look for information on Black Marsh. Hierem's room was not unusual, excluding the four cells that were present and runes in an unknown language. Colin could not find anything related to the Black Marsh incident, but did find a scroll with a cryptic message, where he could find the word \"Umbriel\". Seeing this as a breakthrough, Colin copied the scroll and brought it to Arese, where it was discovered that the message was written in a secret language used by the Synod. Arese would go and discover what the scroll said, while Colin continued with his job.\nFive days later, the Flying City itself would come closer to the Imperial City, however, and when it was two days removed from the capital, the &lt;a href=\"Imperial%20Legion\"&gt;Imperial Legion&lt;/a&gt;, alongside the Synod, had attempted an attack on the city under &lt;a href=\"General%20Takar\"&gt;General Takar&lt;/a&gt;. This attempted failed, however, providing the Penitus Oculatus with knowledge on what didn't work against the forces of Umbriel, while leaving them with little time to discover what would. At the same time, rumor among the Penitus Oculatus had been that Attrebus Mede had been found in the Waterfront District of the Imperial City, though they were lacking a source. Arese had also returned with newfound knowledge, and had learned that the prince was being held captive by Hierem himself. Colin and Arese both decided to find their way to the prime minister's office to confront Hierem.\nWhen the two arrived in the office, however, Hierem was gone, and both Attrebus and &lt;a href=\"Ezhmaar%20Sul\"&gt;Sul&lt;/a&gt; were found in the cells within the room. After freeing both the Prince and his companion, Colin proposed the Prince return to his father, but due to conflicting opinions, all four remained within the office until Hierem returned, taking positions near the sigil which Hierem used to travel to Umbriel from the Imperial City.\nWhen Hierem had returned, Attrebus and Sul left for Umbriel. Colin struck the prime minister with his dagger, but did not kill him, arguing with Arese that they needed him alive. After a fight, Hierem was killed, and both Colin and Arese had been weakened. When Colin tried to help Arese up again, she stabbed him with a knife, and moved out of the office, claiming Hierem owed her something. It would turn out that Arese was planning on trying to absorb the power of Umbriel through the arcane arts, but she was killed by Colin before her plan could come to pass, and shortly after, Umbriel disappeared, as Attrebus and Sul had successfully destroyed the Flying City.\n&lt;a href=\"The%20Crimson%20Dirks%20%28Faction%29\"&gt;The Crimson Dirks&lt;/a&gt;.\nSometime before &lt;a href=\"4E%20201\"&gt;4E 201&lt;/a&gt;, the Penitus Oculatus sent an assassin to kill a merchant noble in Cyrodiil who had ties with the Thalmor. While members of the &lt;a href=\"The%20Crimson%20Dirks%20%28Faction%29\"&gt;Crimson Dirks&lt;/a&gt; met with the noble to secure help laundering their stolen goods, the assassin killed the noble and injured one of the Dirks. The Dirks followed the assassin and avoided his surprise attack, causing him to slit his own throat to avoid being captured. Recognising the assassin as an Imperial agent, the Dirks disbanded to avoid Imperial attention.\n&lt;a href=\"4E%20201\"&gt;4E 201&lt;/a&gt;.\nDuring the &lt;a href=\"Dragon%20Crisis\"&gt;Dragon Crisis&lt;/a&gt;, the Penitus Oculatus held an &lt;a href=\"Penitus%20Oculatus%20Outpost\"&gt;outpost&lt;/a&gt; in the village of &lt;a href=\"Dragon%20Bridge\"&gt;Dragon Bridge&lt;/a&gt;, where they served under &lt;a href=\"Commander%20Maro\"&gt;Commander Maro&lt;/a&gt;. The Penitus Oculatus had also become aware of the identity of the leader of the &lt;a href=\"Dark%20Brotherhood\"&gt;Dark Brotherhood&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Astrid\"&gt;Astrid&lt;/a&gt;, and knew the phrase required to enter their last settled &lt;a href=\"Dark%20Brotherhood%20Sanctuary%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Sanctuary&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Falkreath%20Hold\"&gt;Falkreath Hold&lt;/a&gt;. The Agents were waiting for the time to strike, and the Falkreath Sanctuary would eventually be raided at the command of Commander Maro. Even so, corrupt agents within the Penitus Oculatus also existed, and used the Dark Brotherhood to deal with their own problems."}

We nurture and celebrate our beloved ancestors, whose spirits are manifest in the Ancestor Moths. Each moth carries the fjyron of an ancestor's spirit. Loosely translated as the \"will to peace,\" the fjyron can be sung into the silk produced by the Ancestor Moths. When the silk is in turn spun into cloth and embroidered with the genealogy of the correct Ancestor, clothing of wonderous power can be made.\nAdepts of our order are gifted with prescient powers. The wisdom of the ancestors can sing the future into the present. For this reason, our order and our order alone has been given the privilege to interpret the &lt;a href=\"Elder%20Scroll%20%28Lore%29\"&gt;Elder Scrolls&lt;/a&gt;. These writings exceed even the gods, both &lt;a href=\"aedra\"&gt;aedra&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"daedra\"&gt;daedra&lt;/a&gt;. Such insight into the inner fabric of reality comes at a price. Each reading of the Elder Scrolls is more profound than the last. Each leaves the priest blind for longer, and longer periods of time. Finally, the last reading achieves a nearly sublime understanding of that scroll's contents, but the priest is left permanently blinded to the light of this world. No longer can he read the scrolls.\nThis Monastery is dedicated to the service of these noble members of our order. They now live out their lives with the Ancestor Moths that they so love. Their underground demenses are well suited to the moths. They raise and nurture the fragile creatures, singing to them constantly. They harvest the silk and spin it into bolts of cloth. They weave the cloth, embroidering it with the genealogies and histories of the ancestors that spun the silk. This is their new life.\nAs they tend the Ancestor Moths, so we tend the blind monks. While they toil in dark, we serve in the light. They need food and water. We provide. They need tools and furniture. We provide. They need secrecy and anonymity. We provide. They need purveyors to sell the fruit of their labors. We provide.\nAt one time, we also provided protection. Many generations ago, &lt;a href=\"Gudrun\"&gt;Gudrun&lt;/a&gt; came to our temple. Newly blinded by visions of what was to be, she brought with her new teachings. The visions of the ancestors foresaw the need of the monks to defend themselves. They train and practice the teachings of Gudrun constantly. They are masters of the sword of no sword, the axes of no axe.\nAs a novitiate, you will learn the teachings of Gudrun. You will learn the way of the &lt;a href=\"Hand-to-Hand\"&gt;peaceful fist&lt;/a&gt;. You will learn to serve the blind monks. You will learn to provide. In time, you may attain the peace and insight of the Ancestor Moths."}

Beyond the Shadowgate they found &lt;a href=\"Azra%27s%20Bandage\"&gt;Azra's Bandage&lt;/a&gt; inside of a crystal, and upon taking it heard Pergan's voice for the second time, informing them that neither the Shadowkey nor the Bandage were meant for you, and that what they take from him will be repayed thricefold.\n&lt;a href=\"Trailslag%27s%20Goods\"&gt;Trailslag's Goods&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Witch%20Tree%201\"&gt;Witch Tree 1&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Witch%20Tree%203\"&gt;Witch Tree 3&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Volstok%20Violet%20Resurrection\"&gt;Volstok Violet Resurrection&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Goblin%20Rescue%202\"&gt;Goblin Rescue 2&lt;/a&gt;.\nEither to open the Shadowgate and return the &lt;a href=\"Shaman%20Headress\"&gt;Shaman Headress&lt;/a&gt; to &lt;a href=\"Ivgrizt\"&gt;Ivgrizt&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;a href=\"Twilight%20Temple\"&gt;Twilight Temple&lt;/a&gt;, in exchange for &lt;a href=\"Olpac%20Trailslag\"&gt;Olpac Trailslag's&lt;/a&gt; pack, to defeat Pergan for &lt;a href=\"The%20Witch%20Tree\"&gt;The Witch Tree&lt;/a&gt;, or to get the Twilight Shadowkey to resurrect &lt;a href=\"Volstok%20Violet\"&gt;Volstok Violet&lt;/a&gt;, the Hero had to defeat Pergan Asuul's first incarnation, which held the Twilight Shadowkey.

High-end perks, such as &lt;a href=\"Shield%20Charge%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Shield Charge&lt;/a&gt;, require a Block level of 100.\nSkill prerequisites aside, most perks for a given skill depend upon a previously obtained perk.

Taking it will not attract any attention if no one noticed the Hero killing Phillida in the first place.\nTravel to the &lt;a href=\"Imperial%20Prison\"&gt;Imperial City Prison&lt;/a&gt;. Enter the second door on the left (pick the Very Hard lock or use the keys found on Phillida's body), and open up the desk and put the finger inside. Note that entering this area is considered trespassing, and there are several &lt;a href=\"Imperial%20Legion%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;Legion&lt;/a&gt; soldiers around ready to attack if the Hero is discovered. Try to enter late at night as the office is more likely to be empty at that time.\nConclusion.\nWith Phillida dead and the bonus completed or not, return to Ocheeva for the next contract."}

Ask the peasant in his field, the cobbler in his shop, or the solicitor in his office if he fears the Daedra Lords because of the ancient practices of the &lt;a href=\"Wild%20Elves\"&gt;Wild Elves&lt;/a&gt;, and all you'll get will be a blank look. The peasant, cobbler, and solicitor only fear &lt;a href=\"Daedra\"&gt;Daedra&lt;/a&gt; and Daedra-worship because they've been told to by established religion and academia, and because their neighbors believe the same thing.\nSo, Phrastus, Daedra worship survives in &lt;a href=\"Tamriel\"&gt;Tamriel&lt;/a&gt; only at the level of forbidden cults? On the contrary, it's easy to show that veneration for Daedra is widespread and widely accepted among the folk of Tamriel, despite the desires and opinions of priests and professors. Ask the hunter why he mutters a prayer to &lt;a href=\"Hircine\"&gt;Hircine&lt;/a&gt; as he draws his bow. Ask the gardener why she asks &lt;a href=\"Aedra\"&gt;Aedra&lt;/a&gt;ms. Ask the guardsman why he invokes the valor of &lt;a href=\"Boethiah\"&gt;Boethiah&lt;/a&gt; as he draws his sword. And one doesn't have to look hard to find worshipers of &lt;a href=\"Sanguine\"&gt;Sanguine&lt;/a&gt; during Carnaval, or &lt;a href=\"Hermaeus%20Mora\"&gt;Hermaeus Mora&lt;/a&gt; among scholars at any time.\nWhat of the &lt;a href=\"Ashlanders\"&gt;Ashlanders&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"Morrowind\"&gt;Morrowind&lt;/a&gt;, who still venerate the so-called Good Daedra? What of the &lt;a href=\"Spirit%20Wardens\"&gt;Spirit Wardens&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"Menevia%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Menevia&lt;/a&gt;, who follow &lt;a href=\"Azura%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Azura&lt;/a&gt;? What of the &lt;a href=\"Jovial%20Lambasters\"&gt;Jovial Lambasters&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"Rimmen%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Rimmen&lt;/a&gt;, who celebrate &lt;a href=\"Clavicus%20Vile%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Clavicus Vile&lt;/a&gt;?\nWhat, indeed, of the &lt;a href=\"Khajiit\"&gt;Khajiit&lt;/a&gt; of the southern realms? Rather than abjure the Oblivion Lords, the Cat-folk of &lt;a href=\"Elsweyr\"&gt;Elsweyr&lt;/a&gt; venerate them openly, scarcely drawing a distinction between Aedra and Daedra. The Khajiit recognize the benevolent aspects of the Princes, offering them respect at a minimum, and often admiration. &lt;a href=\"Azurah\"&gt;Azurah&lt;/a&gt; is a popular object of worship for Khajiiti magicians, &lt;a href=\"Sheggorath\"&gt;Sheggorath&lt;/a&gt; appeals to the feline taste for wild mischief, and the souls of the dead are placed in the charge of &lt;a href=\"Namiira\"&gt;Namiira&lt;/a&gt;.\nYet Phrastus would have you believe every mortal in Tamriel cringes in horror at the mention of Daedra, and mocks my own work when I show him up for the charlatan he is. Or can we explain his petty hostility in another way? Wasn't it Phrastus himself who approached me at the &lt;a href=\"Dragonstar%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Dragonstar&lt;/a&gt; Conclave of Antiquarian Scholars, Phrastus who pointed out it was the 16th of &lt;a href=\"Sun%27s%20Dawn\"&gt;Sun's Dawn&lt;/a&gt;, Phrastus who suggested we meet later that evening to \"appropriately celebrate Sanguine's summoning day\"?

The &lt;a href=\"Speechcraft\"&gt;Speechcraft&lt;/a&gt; skill affects the result of actions where you select a \"pie slice\" and the cost of the bribe option. There are no tools required for the persuasion mini-game.\nPersuasion mechanics.\nThere are four persuasion actions that each occupy a section of the persuasion wheel: \"Joke, Admire, Boast, and Coerce.\" Each character will have one of four reactions to each action: \"Love, Like, Dislike, or Hate.\" Lastly there are four possible magnitudes for each action: \"Maximum, Large, Small, and Minimum.\" How the character feels about each action is reflected by their \"facial expression\" when the action is selected.\nThe persuasion mini game is played in rounds, and in each round all four actions must be taken. The objective is to raise the character's &lt;a href=\"disposition\"&gt;disposition&lt;/a&gt; by matching the biggest magnitude actions, illustrated by the size of the pie slice, with the positive reactions. While the persuasion mini game is active, the target character's disposition will fall at a constant rate until the game is over, so decision of what order to activate the wedges in must be made quickly.\nSpeechcraft.\nHigher levels of Speechcraft will decrease the difficulty of the persuasion mini game by unlocking additional options, changing the effect of selecting certain actions, and increasing the persuasion timer. The core of the game, selecting wedges in a precise order, can be played at any level.\nIn addition, each character has a \"maxed disposition\" level, which is based on which character it is and the player's skill at Speechcraft. As your Speechcraft skill improves, it will have increased effects on character's disposition.\nAlternatives to persuasion.\nPlayers can cast &lt;a href=\"Charm%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;charm&lt;/a&gt; spells to raise disposition. The &lt;a href=\"Imperials%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;Imperial&lt;/a&gt; race's &lt;a href=\"Voice%20of%20the%20Emperor%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;Voice of the Emperor&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Vampire%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;Vampires&lt;/a&gt; Seduction powers are both very handy in this regard.\nAlso, the &lt;a href=\"Mages%20Guild%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;Mages Guild&lt;/a&gt; can give you a mages staff of charm after you complete the \"&lt;a href=\"A%20Mage%27s%20Staff\"&gt;A Mage's Staff&lt;/a&gt;\" quest.\nNote that all of these alternatives stack: if you persuade until \"disposition maxed,\" you can further increase disposition by bribes and spells. It should be noted that the cost of bribes will increase as you increase your level. In fact, individual spells stack: if you cast multiple \"Charm\"-type spells on a character, you can easily get almost anyone to 100 disposition with only apprentice skill in Speechcraft and &lt;a href=\"Illusion%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;Illusion&lt;/a&gt;. It is also possible at apprentice Illusion, or even earlier, to create a 100-point short-term (around 5 seconds) charm spell that allows you to max out your disposition with everybody in the game.\nHaving a weapon ready when talking to a character will (temporarily) lower their disposition, allowing you to raise their disposition even higher; simply put your weapon away when you have maxed out their disposition to remove the penalty.\nHow to persuade.\nUpon starting the persuasion game you'll see the 4 slices aligned with the 4 persuasion actions Joke, Admire, Boast, and Coerce. Each of these slices will be filled to a certain degree. When selecting these slices you can read the facial expression to see how much each character likes it. The Hate and Love will be pretty obvious, but with the less human races Like and Dislike might be just a guess (you'll know after the first round - just watch if the disposition rises or falls).\nThen it's all a matter of selecting the Love or Like slices with a filled pie slice (maximum if possible) and the hate and dislike slices when they aren't as full. The slices rotate in a clockwise manner with each selection, so you can predict where each one is going to land. This might mean that you have to accept a full box on dislike, just to avoid a full box on Hate, which has a far more severe penalty on disposition.\nRemember, disposition reduces steadily as you play the game, so don't take too long in each round. Sometimes it's just impossible to get a raise in disposition from the slices given. No harm done, you can just try over and over. Don't be afraid to select a lesser magnitude slice that will give you a disposition boost if it means you'll avoid losing disposition points in that round.\nWhen your Speechcraft reaches 25, another dimension is added to the game: you can now rotate the slices once without actually selecting a persuasion action. How this is to be used is clear, if the Hate action is currently full but the previous one (in a clockwise manner) is almost empty, you would want to rotate."}

Among mortals, he is considered the Lord of Pestilence; among the Daedra, he is charged with ordering the lower planes of &lt;a href=\"Oblivion%20%28Realm%29\"&gt;Oblivion&lt;/a&gt;. Despite his dragon-like appearance, he is generally considered one of the weakest of the Daedric Princes.\nPhysical appearance.\nIn terms of direct interaction, Peryite is one of the least known of the Daedric Princes, not being recorded by name in the history of any known &lt;a href=\"Tamriel\"&gt;Tamriel&lt;/a&gt;ic culture. When he does appear to mortals, he usually takes the form of a large dragon, wyrm, or an aspect of a gathering of &lt;a href=\"Skeever%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;skeevers&lt;/a&gt;. Even among those mages with the skill and knowledge to travel to the planes of Oblivion, Peryite's &lt;a href=\"The%20Pits\"&gt;Pits&lt;/a&gt; are impossible to enter. This may explain why, when his followers in &lt;a href=\"Cyrodiil\"&gt;Cyrodiil&lt;/a&gt; attempted to contact him, their souls appeared to be stuck on &lt;a href=\"Mehrunes%20Dagon\"&gt;Mehrunes Dagon&lt;/a&gt;'s Oblivion plane, the &lt;a href=\"Deadlands\"&gt;Deadlands&lt;/a&gt;. Not knowing what the Pits look like, it is impossible to tell where the souls were actually trapped.\nPeryite has a &lt;a href=\"Shrine%20to%20Peryite\"&gt;shrine&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Skyrim\"&gt;Skyrim&lt;/a&gt;, north-east of &lt;a href=\"Markarth\"&gt;Markarth&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href=\"Peryite%27s%20Shrine%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;Peryite's Shrine&lt;/a&gt; in Cyrodiil is located next to the &lt;a href=\"Silverfish%20River\"&gt;Silverfish River&lt;/a&gt;.\nIt is said that Peryite's worshipers are to regard his likeness to that of &lt;a href=\"Akatosh\"&gt;Akatosh&lt;/a&gt; as some curious and primordial jest of sorts.\nRoles.\nIndirectly, Peryite has influenced the lives of nearly every mortal inhabitant of &lt;a href=\"Nirn\"&gt;Nirn&lt;/a&gt; throughout history; he is the Lord of Pestilence, the cause of many plagues and pandemic diseases. He is typically listed along with princes such as &lt;a href=\"Molag%20Bal\"&gt;Molag Bal&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Vaermina\"&gt;Vaermina&lt;/a&gt; as one of the few truly evil Daedric Lords, in the mortal &lt;a href=\"Man\"&gt;Man&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Mer\"&gt;Mer&lt;/a&gt; sense of the word.\nIt is said that the goddess &lt;a href=\"Kyne\"&gt;Kyne&lt;/a&gt; gives Peryite the souls of skeevers when they die.\nBeyond his interaction with the mortal world, Peryite is believed to have a specific duty within the realms of Oblivion. He is known as the Taskmaster, and seems to be charged with maintaining the proper order among the lesser Daedric species and the lower planes of Oblivion. He and his followers frequently cite their desire to see the \"natural order\" maintained. This appears to be distinctly different from the meaning of \"order\" as applied to &lt;a href=\"Jyggalag\"&gt;Jyggalag&lt;/a&gt;. Peryite works to maintain the proper, normal order among the Daedric races, while Jyggalag works to impose an unnaturally rigid order upon the planes of existence.\nInvocation.\nPeryite can be summoned in his shrine by offering him a &lt;a href=\"Silver%20Ingot\"&gt;silver ingot&lt;/a&gt;, a &lt;a href=\"Deathbell%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;deathbell&lt;/a&gt; flower, &lt;a href=\"Vampire%20Dust%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;vampire dust&lt;/a&gt; and a &lt;a href=\"flawless%20ruby\"&gt;flawless ruby&lt;/a&gt;."}

They better talk to Dame Falhut, the commanding officer by the main gate. Dame Falhut expresses her concern as since the duke married the daughter of King Fahara'jad, there's been nothing but trouble and now with the &lt;a href=\"Redguards%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Redguard&lt;/a&gt; army at the doorstep and now someone who claims to on a diplomatic mission, arrives with an army behind her. Her message is for the duke only but she will not be allowed entrance. Any concerns about that, speak with Sir Hughes inside the castle.\nWhen speaking to Sir Hughes, the Vestige learn they have intercepted secret messages to the King from someone inside the castle with the alias \"Almandine.\" He hopes with a little research in the library, they might find where this came from but unfortunately requires that he personally approve all visitors and he must not know about this. Perhaps the library guard can be persuaded to look the other way, or failing that, to leave his post.\nDownstairs, outside the library Sir Gregory is watching over everyone trying to enter. Asking him to enter gives the reply no, as no access is allowed without the dukes permission. If it's an emergency it's not the library but the armory they need. He'll be kicked out of the castle if he lets anyone in without permission. Asking about his wife will make him tell where his wife is, or intimidating him might get him to open the door.\nHis wife spends a lot of her time at the &lt;a href=\"Alcaire%20Marketplace\"&gt;Alcaire Marketplace&lt;/a&gt;, where she can be found if one can't intimidate Sir Gregory. She misses &lt;a href=\"Wayrest%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Wayrest&lt;/a&gt; as she thinks these backwater merchants have no patience. Never are they grateful so she is waiting for someone to help her with her with her groceries.\nWith this information it's time to talk to Sir Gregory again. He's so angry to hear about someone helping his wife he heads out the door. Leaving the library open to anyone. After entering one will find a clue to read, &lt;a href=\"The%20Royal%20Lineage%20of%20Sentinel\"&gt;The Royal Lineage of Sentinel&lt;/a&gt;. It seems \"Almandine\" is the Duchess herself and Sir Hughes wants to avoid alerting her and the Redguard army that they know about the secret communication, so they must be taken care of carefully."}

House Dres, a Great House of Morrowind found in the southern part of the province, had been gathering Argonian slaves from northern Black Marsh for generations, as a means to sustain its agrarian agricultural society, due to its &lt;a href=\"saltrice\"&gt;saltrice&lt;/a&gt; plantations relying solely on slave labor.\nAs such, the war found its origins in a &lt;a href=\"slavery\"&gt;slave&lt;/a&gt; revolt in the lands of &lt;a href=\"House%20Dres\"&gt;House Dres&lt;/a&gt;, one of the Great Houses of Morrowind. Just before the war would break out, a group of &lt;a href=\"Argonians\"&gt;Argonians&lt;/a&gt; had captured &lt;a href=\"Roris\"&gt;Roris&lt;/a&gt;, who was loyal to the Tribunal faith, even following torture by the Argonian sorcerers. A desire of revenge and justice for Saint Roris would become the rallying cry for the war, and as such, Morrowind declared war. The swamplands of southern Morrowind would become home to a bloody war between Argonians and Dunmer, and during the war the Imperial General &lt;a href=\"Symmachus\"&gt;Symmachus&lt;/a&gt; was slain."}

Give me your map, and I will show you where its echo can be found\" - with that, a location will be added to the map and a &lt;a href=\"Quests%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;miscellaneous objective&lt;/a&gt; will be added to the Journal. If he has no locations to show you, Arngeir will say: \"There is only silence right now. Perhaps later we will hear one of the lost Words.\"\nIf the Dragonborn speaks to him about the &lt;a href=\"Blades%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Blades&lt;/a&gt; wanting Paarthurnax killed, he will respond by calling them bloodthirsty barbarians and will mention his warning to the Dragonborn about the Blades when the Dragonborn asked about the &lt;a href=\"Dragonrend\"&gt;Dragonrend&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Dragon%20Shouts\"&gt;shout&lt;/a&gt;. If asked about what the Blades said about Paarthurnax, he will reveal that what they say is true, but will explain that all dragons served Alduin and that, had it not been for Paarthurnax, the rebellion against Alduin would have failed.\nIf the Dragonborn says they will not kill Paarthurnax, he will respond saying that &lt;a href=\"Kynareth\"&gt;Kynareth&lt;/a&gt; bestowed the gift of wisdom on the Dragonborn and urges them to continue on their path.

He will then say that Paarthurnax is safe from the Blades' malice, to which Delphine says \"for now\" and that the Blades' memory is long. Should the Dragonborn say that they are still unsure of what to do, Arngeir will highlight the need to think the decision through carefully, but will still praise the decision by saying, \"Doing nothing can be the wisest choice, although strangely often the most difficult.\"\nIf the Dragonborn chooses to kill Paarthurnax, Arngeir will reprimand them for doing so. He will say, \"This is how you repay our trust?! Paarthurnax's trust?! His noble spirit... the wisdom of ages... his deep understanding of our existence... all gone and for what? A mindless vendetta urged on by a cabal of Akaviri barbarians! Begone, before even my philosophy is tested beyond the breaking point. We are men of peace. You are not.\" The Dragonborn will be essentially denounced by the Greybeards, and they cannot be asked to help find &lt;a href=\"Word%20Walls%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Word Walls&lt;/a&gt;.\nIf this is done before &lt;a href=\"Season%20Unending\"&gt;Season Unending&lt;/a&gt;, he will talk to the Dragonborn again during the quest, but afterwards, the only dialogue will be \"We have nothing to say to each other.

Although he won't tell me what they're for, he wants me to bring him a number of Dwarven Cogs.\"\"\nWalkthrough.\nAfter completing the quest \"&lt;a href=\"Hitting%20the%20Books\"&gt;Hitting the Books&lt;/a&gt;,\" the Dragonborn will have the option to ask Arniel Gane if there is anything he can be assisted with. Doing this will start the quest, which has four phases. Speaking to Arniel, who is located in the College of Winterhold, will reveal that he is working on a secret project and requires the Dragonborn's help.\nPart one \u2013 &lt;a href=\"Dwemer%20Cog\"&gt;Dwemer Cog&lt;/a&gt;s.\nArniel will first ask the Dragonborn to find ten Dwemer cogs. Initially, he will not say what he wants them for. This quest may be started either prior to receiving the quest \"&lt;a href=\"The%20Staff%20of%20Magnus%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;The Staff of Magnus&lt;/a&gt;,\" or after that quest has been completed. After obtaining the cogs head back to the College.\nThis part will become available after the quest \"&lt;a href=\"Good%20Intentions\"&gt;Good Intentions&lt;/a&gt;\" has begun. Before that, he will not speak about the Dwemer cogs at all.\nPart two \u2013 Warped Soul Gem.\nAfter turning in the cogs to Arniel, he requests that Enthir be asked about delivering some purchased goods. After a discussion with Enthir, the Dragonborn is tasked with finding the Staff of Tandil at a random location (some are listed below), and returning it to Enthir as payment for a warped soul gem that is warped beyond the ability to be able to capture a soul.\nKnown locations of the staff include:\nPart three \u2013 &lt;a href=\"Dwemer%20Convector\"&gt;Dwemer Convector&lt;/a&gt;.\nThis part of the quest cannot be started until the quest \"&lt;a href=\"The%20Eye%20of%20Magnus\"&gt;The Eye of Magnus&lt;/a&gt;\" is complete.\nUpon speaking to Arniel again, it is discovered that his project is going terribly. He claims to have forgotten to take into account the heat gain and has consequently destroyed his only working model.\nIt is at this point that he reveals he is attempting to discover how the &lt;a href=\"Dwemer\"&gt;Dwemer&lt;/a&gt; disappeared \"instantly, and completely\" by recreating the event. The parts the Dragonborn helped recover were made into a Dwarven convector, which broke during his last attempt to recreate the event. When asked if he wants to build another, he says that he would rather have the Dragonborn find the convectors, scattered throughout Skyrim, made by the Dwarves themselves. Arniel then teaches the spell required to heat the convectors (a &lt;a href=\"Arniel%27s%20Convection\"&gt;novice Destruction spell&lt;/a&gt;). Three seconds of burning with the spell is all that is needed to heat the soul gem. Arniel postulates that by doing this, the Dwemer may possibly be contacted again.\nThe locations of Dwemer convectors are marked on the map. Some convectors are in locations that can be &lt;a href=\"Fast%20Travel%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;fast traveled&lt;/a&gt; to, and some are not.\nUpon completing this part of the quest and returning to Arniel, the Dragonborn is thanked and told that the final piece will be arriving soon.\nPart four \u2013 &lt;a href=\"Keening%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Keening&lt;/a&gt;.\nAfter leaving the College of Winterhold for a few days after dropping off the modified soul gem, conversing with Arniel again will reveal that once again Enthir is giving him trouble. When Enthir is asked about it, however, he claims that this time it is not actually his fault. He says he did not keep close tabs on this package because Arniel set up the delivery himself. Enthir suggests searching for the courier, and directs the Dragonborn to one of the following radiant locations:\nOnce the Dragonborn retrieves the package, which turns out to be the dagger &lt;a href=\"Keening%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Keening&lt;/a&gt;, and returns to the College and gives it to Arniel, he will give a brief monologue about what he is attempting to do, and then proceeds to hit the soul gem with the dagger. Eventually, there is an explosion of energy, and his body vanishes\u2014similar to when the Dwemer vanished after &lt;a href=\"Kagrenac\"&gt;Kagrenac&lt;/a&gt; used Keening and the other tools on the &lt;a href=\"Heart%20of%20Lorkhan\"&gt;Heart of Lorkhan&lt;/a&gt;. This leaves Keening on the floor, completes the quest, and gives the Dragonborn a &lt;a href=\"Summon%20Arniel%27s%20Shade\"&gt;Conjuration spell to summon Arniel's shade&lt;/a&gt;."}
{"id": "146140", "revid": "17401442", "url": "https://elderscrolls.fandom.com/wiki?curid=146140", "title": "Arniel's Shade", "text": "Arniel's Shade is a &lt;a href=\"ghost%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;ghost&lt;/a&gt; of the &lt;a href=\"College%20of%20Winterhold%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;College of Winterhold&lt;/a&gt; mage &lt;a href=\"Arniel%20Gane\"&gt;Arniel Gane&lt;/a&gt;, who was destroyed or possibly transported to another plane at the conclusion of the quest \"&lt;a href=\"Arniel%27s%20Endeavor\"&gt;Arniel's Endeavor&lt;/a&gt;.\" The &lt;a href=\"Last%20Dragonborn\"&gt;Dragonborn&lt;/a&gt; will witness this unexpected occurrence, when given the spell to summon the apparition, which is called &lt;a href=\"Summon%20Arniel%27s%20Shade\"&gt;Summon Arniel's Shade&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe spirit appears just as Gane himself did the last time the Dragonborn saw him in person, except that the robes he's wearing include a hood. He is summoned by a two-handed &lt;a href=\"Conjuration%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Conjuration&lt;/a&gt; spell that requires no &lt;a href=\"Magicka%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Magicka&lt;/a&gt;, and he remains with the Dragonborn as an ally for sixty seconds. The ghost will engage any nearby enemies (including &lt;a href=\"Dragons%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;dragons&lt;/a&gt;), and he moves aggressively around the combat area attacking with a continuous lightning stream that appears to be a stronger version of the &lt;a href=\"Sparks%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Sparks&lt;/a&gt; spell: it may be true that this is the only method of attack he makes use of.\nArniel's Shade, from the time he is summoned to the time he vanishes, certainly appears to be beyond injury of any kind, and elsewhere this has been attributed to his ghostly nature. It's possible that he has never been observed on his hands and knees in a nearly incapacitated state, as has been the case with numerous other &lt;a href=\"Followers%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;followers&lt;/a&gt; over time; furthermore, it is also possible that he has never been dispatched by an opponent before the spell's sixty seconds of time has expired. However, when not in combat and following the Dragonborn Arniel's Shade can be heard gasping or perhaps retching from time to time, as if in pain or suffering.\nThe Dragonborn, if close enough, is given the prompt to talk to the spirit when not in combat, but he does not respond to this and no dialogue options are available. Consequently, just like a summoned &lt;a href=\"Atronach\"&gt;Atronach&lt;/a&gt; but unlike a genuine follower, Arniel's Shade can't really be interacted with, insofar as he cannot be asked to wait someplace, or carry some of the Dragonborn's extra &lt;a href=\"Weapons%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;weapons&lt;/a&gt; or gear.\nHowever, while the Dragonborn can't interact with the ghost, the ghost does attempt to interact with the Dragonborn. If his sixty seconds of time are nearly gone and he is not in combat, he will periodically speak to the Dragonborn when nearby: sometimes it's nothing more than the general question, \"Yes?\" At other times the ghost seems to actually recognize the Dragonborn personally, and, depending on the circumstances, will say something specific, \"What can I do for you, &lt;a href=\"Arch-Mage\"&gt;Arch-Mage&lt;/a&gt;?\"\nArniel's Shade is a shrewd, powerful, evidently invincible temporary follower that the Dragonborn can place on the battlefield in moments."}

Upon being freed, Tolfdir and the Dragonborn investigate a hidden tunnel in the tomb, eventually coming in contact with a member of the &lt;a href=\"Psijic%20Order\"&gt;Psijic Order&lt;/a&gt;. After discovering the &lt;a href=\"Eye%20of%20Magnus\"&gt;Eye of Magnus&lt;/a&gt; in the rooms below the tomb, the Dragonborn returns to inform &lt;a href=\"Savos%20Aren\"&gt;Savos Aren&lt;/a&gt;.

During the battle, he will not personally use magic to attack, instead relying entirely upon unarmed combat. However, he will reanimate characters who die during the battle as zombies for further assistance.\n&lt;a href=\"Arniel%27s%20Endeavor\"&gt;Arniel's Endeavor&lt;/a&gt;.\nAs part of a secret experiment, Arniel tasks the Dragonborn with retrieving ten &lt;a href=\"Dwemer%20Cog\"&gt;Dwemer Cog&lt;/a&gt;s. After finding the &lt;a href=\"Dwemer%20Artifacts\"&gt;artifacts&lt;/a&gt;, the Dragonborn must then contact &lt;a href=\"Enthir\"&gt;Enthir&lt;/a&gt; about a &lt;a href=\"Warped%20Soul%20Gem\"&gt;Warped Soul Gem&lt;/a&gt; Arniel wanted from him. Enthir was reluctant to provide the item to Arniel, but relents if the Dragonborn retrieves a &lt;a href=\"Staves%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;staff&lt;/a&gt; Enthir accidentally sold to a &lt;a href=\"Necromancer%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;necromancer&lt;/a&gt;. Enthir surrenders the gem after the staff is returned to him.

The glorious dungheap known as &lt;a href=\"Riften%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Riften&lt;/a&gt; came into view about midday. The mead-befuddled natives stared at us in their endearing, cross-eyed way, squinting through the alcohol fumes, probably wondering if we were edible. Deciding not, they staggered off, doubtless to vomit on each other in some sort of Nord festivity. Netapatuu secured for us the least flea-ridden beds in the least decrepit hostel in town and I finally had a decent night's sleep.\nDAY 10:Wasting no more time in Riften, we headed for the far gate as fast as our mounts would take us. Not far up the road, we were assured, lay our destination, the tomb at &lt;a href=\"Pinepeak%20Caverns\"&gt;Pinepeak Caverns&lt;/a&gt;. Long have I cursed the Pact officials who forced this journey on me, citing the need for &lt;a href=\"Dunmer%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Dunmer&lt;/a&gt; to show the lesser races our dedication to the common good.\nDAY 12:Our guide says Pinepeak is the mountain looming ahead of us. If it's not just the mead talking, then I need to re-read my notes. The ancient &lt;a href=\"The%20Companions%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Companion&lt;/a&gt; spirit entombed within the cavern is said to still be around, in non-corporeal form. A shard containing a sliver of her essence should be embedded in the wall just inside the cave. With that, she can possess a body and I can drag out of her any light she might shed on some creature named \"&lt;a href=\"Sinmore\"&gt;Sinmore&lt;/a&gt;.\" Who knows, perhaps long-dead Nords are wiser than living ones? They certainly can't smell worse.\nDAY 13:Leaving camp to enter the cavern! Tomes, journal, and writing implements are all prepared. Netapatuu keeps muttering about ill omens, a cold breeze blowing up his skirt, or some such nonsense. I sent him to the back of the group and ordered him to shut up. Tonight's entry will write itself!"}

The tradehouse is owned and run by &lt;a href=\"Arrille\"&gt;Arrille&lt;/a&gt;. It is the only shop in town and is located by the bridge in the center of town. Upon entering, Arrille the merchant can be found behind the counter. In addition to Arrille's shop, there are two &lt;a href=\"Trainers%20%28Morrowind%29\"&gt;trainers&lt;/a&gt; located here, one of whom is a &lt;a href=\"Elone\"&gt;Blades trainer&lt;/a&gt; that &lt;a href=\"Caius%20Cosades%20%28Morrowind%29\"&gt;Caius Cosades&lt;/a&gt; can recommend to the Nerevarine. The tradehouse is divided into two unconnected sections.\nThe main area is publicly accessible and contains all of the NPCs found in the building, the main area has a downstairs area where Arrille can be found. Upstairs, a bar counter can be seen along with some NPC's. Elone and Raflod the Braggart can offer training to the &lt;a href=\"Nerevarine\"&gt;Nerevarine&lt;/a&gt; (though Elone is a Blade trainer only). In addition, there is a storage room, which is accessible only from the outside via a locked door for which there is no key (it requires 70 &lt;a href=\"Security%20%28Morrowind%29\"&gt;security&lt;/a&gt; to unlock). Most of Arrille's wares are stored here, and they're completely unguarded, if the Nerevarine can break in undetected."}

He will then say that the bartender Dreekius is a trusted ally and friend.\nSpeak to Dreekius.\nAfter speaking to Tobias, a conversation with Dreekius will start.

From the Great Hall, head up the stairs and into the Lord's Manor North Wing. It will be hard to gain undetected access to it at night, since two guards stand by the door all night. Either use invisibility when picking the lock at night, or wait until daytime hours when the guards move away from the door to other duties. This movement of the guards happens around 7 AM.\nGo down the hallway a bit and enter the first room on the left; this is &lt;a href=\"Fathis%20Aren\"&gt;Fathis Aren&lt;/a&gt;'s room. The Hero will not find the Arrow in his room, but they may notice that there is a movable pillar straight across from the door one entered. Activate it to enter the &lt;a href=\"Bravil%20Wizard%27s%20Grotto\"&gt;Bravil Wizard's Grotto&lt;/a&gt;. \nNote that this is a good time to fence off anything stolen from Aren's room or other goods. As noted above, this is a long trip and it is best to reserve as much carrying capacity as possible. When returning, the North Wing door will still be unlocked.\nBravil Wizard's Lair.\nLocation Notes.\nThe lair consists of two zones, the Grotto which exits to the Lair and the Lair which exits to the Tower.\nThe Grotto is a long winding set of tunnels and rooms that are filled with &lt;a href=\"Conjurer%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;conjurers&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Mudcrab%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;mudcrabs&lt;/a&gt; and enemies scaled to the Hero's level, such as &lt;a href=\"Spider%20Daedra%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;spider daedra&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Frost%20Atronach%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;frost atronachs&lt;/a&gt;. \nThere is a large pool of water at the point where the cursor on the map image is. This pool is roughly hourglass shaped in vertical cross-section. The upper and lower parts are joined by a hole in the bottom of the top section that is also the top of the bottom section. The top portion consists of normal &lt;a href=\"Slaughterfish%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;slaughterfish&lt;/a&gt; and the exit to the Wizard's Lair. The bottom section contains a &lt;a href=\"Giant%20Slaughterfish%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;giant slaughterfish&lt;/a&gt; and the exit to &lt;a href=\"Niben%20Bay\"&gt;Niben Bay&lt;/a&gt;.\nThere is also a door northeast of the pool which requires &lt;a href=\"Keys%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;Aren's Strange Key&lt;/a&gt; to open, though the key is not necessary as the other side of the door can be reached from the corridor leading from the upper exit of the pool.\nWalkthrough.\nHead straight ahead and the Hero will be confronted with a leveled &lt;a href=\"Dremora%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;dremora&lt;/a&gt;. Kill him and keep going straight through the gate. Follow the water-filled tunnel until one gets to a deep pool of water. Kill the slaughterfish and swim down (past a few rock ledges). Looking to the left (roughly northwest), one will notice an opening in the wall. It is slightly to the west of the where the map indicates the path of the tunnel and about half-way down to the hole. Swimming too far down one will pass it: if the hole is reached, one has gone to far. As the water is dark and murky, visual assistance from either &lt;a href=\"Light%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;light&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"Night-Eye%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;night-eye&lt;/a&gt; effects will help to spot the exit. Swim through that and back onto land.\nIf one desires to confront the giant slaughterfish, swim to the bottom of the top section and through the large hole. The fish will be waiting on one side. There is a secret exit after a small tunnel (roughly west) that leads to a trapdoor. The fish will drop a large amount of leveled loot, including an enchanted item. The trapdoor comes out underwater in the southern end of Niben Bay. Next to the trapdoor, is a chest with a small amount of gold.\nOne will need to be an &lt;a href=\"Argonians%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;Argonian&lt;/a&gt; or possess some form of &lt;a href=\"Water%20Breathing%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;water breathing&lt;/a&gt; such as potions, the &lt;a href=\"Jewel%20of%20the%20Rumare\"&gt;Jewel of the Rumare&lt;/a&gt; the Hero got after doing &lt;a href=\"Go%20Fish\"&gt;Go Fish&lt;/a&gt;, or the &lt;a href=\"Fin%20Gleam\"&gt;Fin Gleam&lt;/a&gt; that can be found near Anvil in order to reach the trapdoor and thence to the surface without drowning.\nAfter going through the opening, follow the tunnels and rooms (there is only one main way) to the Bravil Wizard's Lair. On the way they will pass a &lt;a href=\"Nirnroot%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;nirnroot&lt;/a&gt; plant. The Hero may come across more conjurers, &lt;a href=\"Rat%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;rats&lt;/a&gt;, or dremora. Follow the hallways and rooms, either fighting or sneaking past enemies.\nAlternatively, one can enter the grotto via the trapdoor described above, using the minimap to help navigate to the spot on the floor of Niben Bay where it is. This will skip sneaking through the castle and the west side of the Grotto. This is easier, but will cause the Hero to miss out on some loot, sneaking experience and so on. It also makes the fight with the giant slaughterfish mandatory as the Hero will be coming up through its lair.\n&lt;a href=\"Fathis%20Aren%27s%20Tower\"&gt;Fathis Aren's Tower&lt;/a&gt;.\nOnce entering the Tower the Hero will be met with multiple Oblivion-type monsters depending on level, along with anything else the Daedra conjure and often at the same time.\nKill them all and get up to the third floor of the tower exterior where they will find a small room with a chest containing the &lt;a href=\"Arrow%20of%20Extrication%20%28Item%29\"&gt;Arrow of Extrication&lt;/a&gt; and the tower key in a chest on the far side of the alchemy table from the entrance.

Exit the tower's large door using the key from the chest. If the Hero is spotted, Fathis will attack (note that killing him will also result in suspension from the Mages Guild).\nAn alternative solution to sparing Fathis is if the Hero is the Arch-mage, as he will not even look up from his work and ignore the Hero or simply run towards the chest, plunder the contents and run out of the tower.\nReturn to the Gray Fox in Chorrol for the reward. He will give the Hero 500 gold."}

Damage is also dependent on the amount of power when the arrow was launched. For example, just tapping the 'fire' key or trigger will result in a very weak shot, while a stronger pull or hold of the key will strengthen the shot.\nUpon shooting a creature with arrows, there is a moderate chance the arrows will go into the creature's inventory, where it can be retrieved from the corpse of the slain creature. This does not apply to some creatures, such as &lt;a href=\"Skeleton%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;skeletons&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"atronach\"&gt;atronach&lt;/a&gt;s, who have no fleshy parts for the arrows to stick into. Instead, arrows that hit such creatures ricochet and fall to the ground, where they can later be collected.\nThe same applies to the player character--when shot with an arrow, the projectile goes directly into one's inventory, while the arrow itself is pictured sticking out of the character's body in both third-person perspective and in the menu. If the arrows cannot be removed, the arrows will be visible, but will not add on to weight.\nThis can be a source of some confusion for players who were extremely close to their &lt;a href=\"encumbrance\"&gt;encumbrance&lt;/a&gt; limit and fight an archer; the added weight of the arrows can push the total inventory weight over the limit, and cause the character to be over-burdened. This can grow to be a significant problem, as taking the time to repeatedly drop arrows out of your inventory in the middle of a fight can be lethal, particularly when attacked by multiple enemies.\nTypes of arrows.\nList of arrows in order of potency."}

Artaeum is the home of the &lt;a href=\"Psijic%20Order\"&gt;Psijic Order&lt;/a&gt;, an ancient order of monks that follow the Old Ways, a combination of &lt;a href=\"Mysticism\"&gt;Mysticism&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"Eleven%20Forces\"&gt;Eleven Forces&lt;/a&gt;, and the forces of Space and Life. Artaeum is known for disappearing off the face of &lt;a href=\"Nirn\"&gt;Nirn&lt;/a&gt;, doing so twice, each in the span of hundreds of years or so.\nDescription.\nGeography.\nArtaeum is the third largest island of the Summerset Isles, behind the island of &lt;a href=\"Auridon\"&gt;Auridon&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Isle%20of%20Summerset\"&gt;Isle of Summerset&lt;/a&gt;. Artaeum is a horn-shaped island to the top, and it curves to the southwest, where a vast mountain range is located, taking up the entire southern portion of Artaeum. The northern half is a sprawling grassland, with hills ascending south. It consists of primarily idyllic orchards, and misty woodlands. Like the main island, there is silver coral along the coast, specifically in the east. Artaeum, on &lt;a href=\"Tamriel\"&gt;Tamriel&lt;/a&gt;, is located near the eastern kingdom of &lt;a href=\"Moridunon\"&gt;Moridunon&lt;/a&gt; (specifically the village of &lt;a href=\"Potansa\"&gt;Potansa&lt;/a&gt;), and west of the mainland village of &lt;a href=\"Runcibae\"&gt;Runcibae&lt;/a&gt;. On the northern tip of Artaeum is the &lt;a href=\"Ceporah%20Tower\"&gt;Ceporah Tower&lt;/a&gt;, a large tower of unique architecture that is the headquarters of the Psijic Order, and the Council of Artaeum. Along the mountains are various ruins, such as the &lt;a href=\"Colosseum%20of%20the%20Old%20Ways\"&gt;Colosseum of the Old Ways&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Traitor%27s%20Vault\"&gt;Traitor's Vault&lt;/a&gt;. The &lt;a href=\"College%20of%20Psijics%20Ruins\"&gt;College of Psijics Ruins&lt;/a&gt; is a minor settlement, which contains the &lt;a href=\"Vault%20of%20Moawita\"&gt;Vault of Moawita&lt;/a&gt;, the Psijic's artifact room. When it disappears, Artaeum is no longer on the face of &lt;a href=\"Mundus\"&gt;Mundus&lt;/a&gt;, deep in the Aurbis.\nHistory.\n&lt;a href=\"First%20Era\"&gt;First Era&lt;/a&gt;.\nOrigins of the Psijic Order &amp; Onward.\nArtaeum's history is an enigma; the Ceporah Tower predates the High Elven society by several hundred years. The Psijic Order had taken refuge on Artaeum when they opposed the idea of Aldmer descending from &lt;a href=\"Aedra\"&gt;Aedra&lt;/a&gt;, deciding to follow the &lt;a href=\"Old%20Ways\"&gt;Old Ways&lt;/a&gt;, a philosophy practiced by the Aedra themselves. Because of the corruption seen on Summerset, the Psijics had remained isolated, acting as advisors to the Kings of Summerset, but by denying the province as their home. The first recorded instance of Artaeum was in &lt;a href=\"1E%2020\"&gt;1E 20&lt;/a&gt;, when the &lt;a href=\"Breton\"&gt;Breton&lt;/a&gt; sage, &lt;a href=\"Voernet\"&gt;Voernet&lt;/a&gt; traveled to Artaeum, meeting the Ritemaster, &lt;a href=\"Iachesis\"&gt;Iachesis&lt;/a&gt;. In these early years of the first era, the Psijic Order had reached out to various candidates for their order, including &lt;a href=\"Asliel%20Direnni\"&gt;Asliel Direnni&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Lilatha\"&gt;Lilatha&lt;/a&gt;. At some point or the other, the group had garnered allies such as the &lt;a href=\"Tribunal\"&gt;Tribunal&lt;/a&gt;, specifically &lt;a href=\"Sotha%20Sil\"&gt;Sotha Sil&lt;/a&gt;. Underneath Ceporah is &lt;a href=\"the%20Dreaming%20Cave\"&gt;the Dreaming Cave&lt;/a&gt;, which is a portal to the planes of &lt;a href=\"Oblivion\"&gt;Oblivion&lt;/a&gt;. Even though Artaeum is the private island of the Psijics, it has hosted some minor settlements, such as the location, &lt;a href=\"Nicrythe%20Tower\"&gt;Nicrythe Tower&lt;/a&gt;. The people of Artaeum (excluding the Psijics) follow the news and ongoings on Summerset.\nThe Last Year of 2920 &amp; the Coldharbour Compact.\nBy &lt;a href=\"1E%202920\"&gt;1E 2920&lt;/a&gt;, the Magus of the &lt;a href=\"Tribunal\"&gt;Tribunal&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Sotha%20Sil\"&gt;Sotha Sil&lt;/a&gt; had traveled to the mystic island of Artaeum, teaching and guiding initiates in their training. But on the 3rd of &lt;a href=\"Rain%27s%20Hand\"&gt;Rain's Hand&lt;/a&gt;, Sotha Sil traveled to Artaeum on an important mission to the Dreaming Cave. The utter destruction of &lt;a href=\"Gil-Var-Delle\"&gt;Gil-Var-Delle&lt;/a&gt; has led Sotha Sil to call a &lt;a href=\"Coldharbour%20Compact\"&gt;summit&lt;/a&gt; between the &lt;a href=\"Daedric%20Princes\"&gt;Daedric Princes&lt;/a&gt; of Oblivion. With the vile depths of &lt;a href=\"Coldharbour\"&gt;Coldharbour&lt;/a&gt;, Sotha Sil meet with the Daedric Lords, &lt;a href=\"Azura\"&gt;Azura&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Boethiah\"&gt;Boethiah&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Herma-Mora\"&gt;Herma-Mora&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Hircine\"&gt;Hircine&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Malacath\"&gt;Malacath&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Mehrunes%20Dagon\"&gt;Mehrunes Dagon&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Molag%20Bal\"&gt;Molag Bal&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Sheogorath\"&gt;Sheogorath&lt;/a&gt;. This meeting of the greatest minds would go on to create the &lt;a href=\"Coldharbour%20Compact\"&gt;Coldharbour Compact&lt;/a&gt;, an agreement where the forces of Oblivion would not invade the continent of Tamriel, but this would be somewhat broken months later with the &lt;a href=\"Sack%20of%20Mournhold\"&gt;Sack of Mournhold&lt;/a&gt; under the control of Mehrunes Dagon. Even with this agreement, half of the Daedric Princes were not present, among these was &lt;a href=\"Namira\"&gt;Namira&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Peryite\"&gt;Peryite&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Sanguine\"&gt;Sanguine&lt;/a&gt;. Sotha Sil was on Artaeum for a week, until &lt;a href=\"Almalexia\"&gt;Almalexia&lt;/a&gt; arrived to bring him back to Morrowind.\n&lt;a href=\"Second%20Era\"&gt;Second Era&lt;/a&gt;.\nGalerion the Mystic and Artaeum in the Common Era.\nBy the early second era, the Psijic Order had become a prestigious group that only accepted the utmost talented minds, one of these people was &lt;a href=\"Vanus%20Galerion\"&gt;Vanus Galerion&lt;/a&gt; who took passage into Artaeum, via the village of &lt;a href=\"Potansa\"&gt;Potansa&lt;/a&gt;, with the help of &lt;a href=\"Heliand\"&gt;Heliand&lt;/a&gt;. Galerion traveled onto the shores of Artaeum, where Iachesis recognized the boy's potential, to which he was accepted into the order. During his studies, Vanus Galerion befriends another Altmer youth, &lt;a href=\"Mannimarco\"&gt;Mannimarco&lt;/a&gt;, who conducted sinister experiments from outside the eyes of the Psijics. On one fateful trip to what became &lt;a href=\"Traitor%27s%20Vault\"&gt;Traitor's Vault&lt;/a&gt;, Galerion learned about Mannimarco's ventures into what became &lt;a href=\"Necromancy\"&gt;Necromancy&lt;/a&gt;, to which he confronted him. Once Mannimarco was expelled from Artaeum, he had spread his knowledge of Necromancy, to all corners of the world. Galerion sought to stop his nemesis from any further advancements, but the Psijic Order were unconcerned, seeking to remain on Artaeum. Galerion took this to his own hands, gathering like-minded mages and artificers at the city-state of &lt;a href=\"Firsthold\"&gt;Firsthold&lt;/a&gt;. Galerion had garnered the approval from &lt;a href=\"High%20Kinlord%20Rilis%20XII\"&gt;High Kinlord Rilis XII&lt;/a&gt; and Iachesis on the formation of what became, the &lt;a href=\"Mages%20Guild\"&gt;Mages Guild&lt;/a&gt;. But with the Guild of Mages, came the disappearance of Artaeum. For the first time, the entire island was gone, off the face of Nirn.\nArtaeum's history is unknown, from when it disappeared, to when it returned roughly five hundred years later. But even then, the people of the island have followed Summerset's history, while the Psijic Order watched from afar. When &lt;a href=\"Queen%20Ayrenn\"&gt;Queen Ayrenn&lt;/a&gt; was born on the 5th of &lt;a href=\"Second%20Seed\"&gt;Second Seed&lt;/a&gt;, in &lt;a href=\"2E%20555\"&gt;2E 555&lt;/a&gt;, the people of Artaeum celebrated for fifty-five days, as did the rest of the Summerset Isles. Many notable figures have traveled to the Isle of Artaeum, during the time of the &lt;a href=\"Interregnum\"&gt;Interregnum&lt;/a&gt;, such as &lt;a href=\"Morian%20Zenas\"&gt;Morian Zenas&lt;/a&gt;, a professor of the &lt;a href=\"Arcane%20University\"&gt;Arcane University&lt;/a&gt;, who stepped forth into the Dreaming Cave. Regardless, Artaeum has since had visits become rare.\nDuring the events of , Artaeum is in a physically ambiguous location. According to &lt;a href=\"Oriandra\"&gt;Oriandra&lt;/a&gt;, a member of the Order at this time, the Psijic Order sent Artaeum away from Tamriel to \"better promote meditative study and contemplation.\"\nThe Triad's Plot and the Abyssal Cabal.\nDuring the &lt;a href=\"Interregnum\"&gt;Interregnum&lt;/a&gt; around &lt;a href=\"2E%20583\"&gt;2E 583&lt;/a&gt;, the Island of Artaeum was under the supervision of Ritemaster Iachesis, as he has throughout the eras. One day, Sotha Sil of the &lt;a href=\"Clockwork%20City\"&gt;Clockwork City&lt;/a&gt; had approached them, the Daedric Princes, &lt;a href=\"Clavicus%20Vile\"&gt;Clavicus Vile&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Mephala\"&gt;Mephala&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Nocturnal\"&gt;Nocturnal&lt;/a&gt; gathered together to form the group known as &lt;a href=\"the%20Triad\"&gt;the Triad&lt;/a&gt;, in the effort to gain omnipotent power. The Prince of Bargains had made his first move on the island-region of &lt;a href=\"Vvardenfell\"&gt;Vvardenfell&lt;/a&gt;, when his trusted hound, &lt;a href=\"Barbas\"&gt;Barbas&lt;/a&gt; attempted to siphon the divine energy of &lt;a href=\"Vivec\"&gt;Vivec&lt;/a&gt; to find the Clockwork City. And &lt;a href=\"Nocturnal\"&gt;Nocturnal&lt;/a&gt; had used the Shadow of Sotha Sil in her goal of retrieving the &lt;a href=\"Skeleton%20Key\"&gt;Skeleton Key&lt;/a&gt;, and conquering the Clockwork City. Sotha Sil approached Iachesis when Nocturnal had made her plans known to involve the &lt;a href=\"Isle%20of%20Summerset\"&gt;Isle of Summerset&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Crystal%20Tower\"&gt;Crystal Tower&lt;/a&gt;. The Psijic Order had begun to investigate the sub-continent, sending one of their agents, &lt;a href=\"Valsirenn\"&gt;Valsirenn&lt;/a&gt; to Summerset, who would, in turn, go to the city-state of &lt;a href=\"Shimmerene\"&gt;Shimmerene&lt;/a&gt;. Valsirenn and a &lt;a href=\"Vestige\"&gt;Newcomer&lt;/a&gt; obtained an &lt;a href=\"Abyssal%20Pearl\"&gt;Abyssal Pearl&lt;/a&gt; from Shimmerene, which, along with the sinkhole in &lt;a href=\"Rellenthil\"&gt;Rellenthil&lt;/a&gt; had proved that the &lt;a href=\"Sea%20Sload\"&gt;Sea Sload&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"Ul%27vor%20Kus\"&gt;Ul'vor Kus&lt;/a&gt; were now involved. The Pearl was brought back to the Ceporah Tower, but this proved to be a mistake.\nShadows of the Triad and K'Tora's Folly.\nWith the Abyssal Pearl, &lt;a href=\"K%27Tora\"&gt;K'Tora&lt;/a&gt;, an ancient enemy of Iachesis, and member of the &lt;a href=\"Abyssal%20Cabal\"&gt;Abyssal Cabal&lt;/a&gt; had infiltrated the island of Artaeum, invading using the vile &lt;a href=\"Yaghra\"&gt;Yaghra&lt;/a&gt; of the &lt;a href=\"Sea%20of%20Pearls\"&gt;Sea of Pearls&lt;/a&gt;. After a grueling battle with both the Yaghra and K'Tora, the Newcomer entered the mindscape, to reveal the memory that K'Tora planned to extract from Iachesis. It was shown that K'Tora and the Abyssal Cabal made an alliance with the Triad, and defeated Iachesis in battle. Under his control, the Ritemaster had stolen the Heart of &lt;a href=\"Transparent%20Law\"&gt;Transparent Law&lt;/a&gt;, hiding it away. Before K'Tora could learn of the heart's location, the Newcomer had killed him, and Sotha Sil freed them from fading forever. And so, the Psijic Order, now with Sotha Sil at their side, attempt to find the Heart of Transparent Law before the Triad and the Court of Bedlam get it. But the Psijics try to talk with the &lt;a href=\"Sapiarchs\"&gt;Sapiarchs&lt;/a&gt; of the main island, to protect the Crystal Tower from the Court. All the while, the Psijic Order used &lt;a href=\"the%20Dreaming%20Cave\"&gt;the Dreaming Cave&lt;/a&gt;, to help the &lt;a href=\"Golden%20Knight\"&gt;Golden Knight&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Meridia\"&gt;Meridia&lt;/a&gt;'s Champion, and locate the Heart in the realms of the &lt;a href=\"Evergloam\"&gt;Evergloam&lt;/a&gt;, Nocturnal's plane of Oblivion. Things would change when it was realized that the Heart was implanted into Iachesis the entire time, and so Nocturnal ripped it out his body, betraying both Clavicus Vile and Mephala. With everything, Nocturnal began her conquest over the Crystal Tower, but fortunately, the Newcomer had prevailed, saving Tamriel from their most significant threat yet. With Iachesis gone, Valsirenn was appointed Ritemaster, until the &lt;a href=\"Conclave%20of%20the%20Eleven%20Forces\"&gt;Conclave of the Eleven Forces&lt;/a&gt; had decided on a better candidate.\n&lt;a href=\"Third%20Era\"&gt;Third Era&lt;/a&gt;.\nArtaeum during the Third Era.\nIn &lt;a href=\"2E%20730\"&gt;2E 730&lt;/a&gt;, the island of Artaeum had returned, roughly a hundred years before the rise of &lt;a href=\"Tiber%20Septim\"&gt;Tiber Septim&lt;/a&gt; and the beginning of the &lt;a href=\"Third%20Empire\"&gt;Third Empire&lt;/a&gt;. Many of the members that appeared on the Psijic Order were people considered to be dead by the outside world. It is unknown whether Valsirenn was still the Ritemaster of Artaeum but the island had lived alongside the rest of the continent. But sometime around &lt;a href=\"3E%20155\"&gt;3E 155&lt;/a&gt;, the Loremaster of the Order, &lt;a href=\"Celarus\"&gt;Celarus&lt;/a&gt; had become the leader of the Psijic Order, and by extension, the Psijic Order. From when it returned, all the way to the reign of &lt;a href=\"Uriel%20Septim%20VII\"&gt;Uriel Septim VII&lt;/a&gt;, the Psijic Order had made appearances through noteworthy events. In minor cases, the leaders of &lt;a href=\"Moridunon\"&gt;Moridunon&lt;/a&gt;, and even the Emperor, &lt;a href=\"Uriel%20Septim%20V\"&gt;Uriel Septim V&lt;/a&gt;, had sought the advice of the Psijics, with the latter. But the most well-known was their involvement in the &lt;a href=\"War%20of%20the%20Isle\"&gt;War of the Isle&lt;/a&gt;, which took place in &lt;a href=\"3E%20110\"&gt;3E 110&lt;/a&gt;, as per an elaborate plot conceived by &lt;a href=\"Potema%20Septim\"&gt;Potema Septim&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"Solitude\"&gt;Solitude&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href=\"Antiochus%20Septim\"&gt;Antiochus Septim&lt;/a&gt; and the Kings of Summerset fight against the Maormeri Invasion, under the command of &lt;a href=\"King%20Orgnum\"&gt;King Orgnum&lt;/a&gt;. The victory over the Maormer was attributed to the Psijic Order, who had used powerful storms in repelling the Sea Elves. The last four emperors of Cyrodiil were suspicious of the Psijics, even denying ambassadors onto the Imperial City. But in &lt;a href=\"3E%20432\"&gt;3E 432&lt;/a&gt;, the Psijic Order had begun to accept more people, then before, as the youth became more interested.\n&lt;a href=\"Fourth%20Era\"&gt;Fourth Era&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe Second Disappearance of Artaeum.\nEver since the War of the Isle, the history of Artaeum, and by extension, the Psijic Order is unknown, but their influence was beyond the Summerset Isles. Psijic advisors were known to help people such as the Arch-Mage of the &lt;a href=\"College%20of%20Winterhold\"&gt;College of Winterhold&lt;/a&gt;, in faraway Skyrim. However, sometime around &lt;a href=\"4E%20100\"&gt;4E 100&lt;/a&gt;, the island of Artaeum had disappeared once again, but as to why, is currently unknown. When it had disappeared, the &lt;a href=\"Void%20Nights\"&gt;Void Nights&lt;/a&gt; had ended after two years. The twin moons of &lt;a href=\"Masser\"&gt;Masser&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Secunda\"&gt;Secunda&lt;/a&gt; had reappeared, bringing much fear to the Khajiit of &lt;a href=\"Elsweyr\"&gt;Elsweyr&lt;/a&gt;. It is unknown whether these two events coincide with each other, but this was the case with the first disappearance, as the former Psijic, Galerion founded the Mages Guild amidst the beginning of the island's absence. However, it was more likely related to the rising threat of the &lt;a href=\"Third%20Aldmeri%20Dominion\"&gt;Third Aldmeri Dominion&lt;/a&gt;, who were, at the moment, on an impending conflict against the ruined &lt;a href=\"Third%20Empire\"&gt;Third Empire&lt;/a&gt; of Cyrodiil."}

Artaeum is the home of the &lt;a href=\"Psijic%20Order%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Psijic Order&lt;/a&gt;.\nBackground.\nArtaeum is the home of the Psijic Order, a group of scholarly mystics based out of &lt;a href=\"Ceporah%20Tower%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Ceporah Tower&lt;/a&gt;. The island was originally a part of the Summerset archipelago until it disappeard from the face of &lt;a href=\"Nirn\"&gt;Nirn&lt;/a&gt; when the Psijics placed it into a pocket realm to safeguard their home sometime prior to &lt;a href=\"Second%20Era\"&gt;2E 282&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe landscape of Artaeum is much the same as the rest of the &lt;a href=\"Summerset%20Isles%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Summerset Isles&lt;/a&gt;, of which it was a part of. The most notable difference is the sky, featuring golden lines outstretched from an array of orbs, a feature of the pocket realm the island resides in. Various structures of typical &lt;a href=\"Altmer%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Altmeri&lt;/a&gt; architectures are present, but the island's most significant feature, Ceporah Tower, is noticeably not of Altmeri design, its base having been discovered with the island itself and built by a civilization hundreds of years older than that of the Altmer.\nLocations.\nThe following are locations accessible in Artaeum and, with the exception of &lt;a href=\"Unmarked%20Locations%20%28Online%29\"&gt;unmarked locations&lt;/a&gt;, are discoverable on the map.

My age and temperament make such recollections irksome and discouraging\u2014bad for the digestion, as the clinicians say. Nonetheless, I owe it to my students to give them some sense of where our &lt;a href=\"Mages%20Guild%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Guild&lt;/a&gt; came from.\nThose who know me well know that I was not born on Artaeum. No, I grew up in squalor\u2014laboring under a bilious &lt;a href=\"kinlord\"&gt;kinlord&lt;/a&gt; on the Isle of &lt;a href=\"Summerset%20Isles%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Summerset&lt;/a&gt;. It did not last. Circumstances forced me to leave that life behind, and the Psijics discovered my talents shortly thereafter. They told me that my old life was over. No more hiding tomes under floorboards for fear of being discovered. No more hay-raking and knee-bruising scullery work. I would live a sage's life\u2014free to study as I please, so long as those studies advanced the cause of equity, peace, and wisdom. I felt such a great swell of joy in that moment. Of course, no joy lasts forever.\nI told my guide, the mystic Heliand, I was eager to set sail as I had never been on a seafaring vessel before. She laughed and threw down a glowing rune, catapulting us through the Aurbis at speeds I'd never imagined possible. Just seconds later, we found ourselves standing on a windswept hill overlooking the idyllic fields and pastures of Artaeum.\nEach day brought new discoveries. Misty hollows, filled with gregarious nixads. Hidden lagoons with singing waters, clear as fresh-blown glass. Flowers that whispered secrets when the wind blew, and stones with names too long for mortal tongues to speak. I read vigorously, wandered constantly, and quickly earned my gray cloak.\nIt was around this time that I first met &lt;a href=\"Mannimarco%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Mannimarco\u2014who&lt;/a&gt; would one day be called the Worm King. In those days he was a brilliant novice with a promising future, much like me. Our vast talents and contradictory natures made us natural rivals. But then, the Old Ways of the Psijics banned such competition. My mentor, the powerful Ritemaster Iachesis, told me, \"Rivalry sows the seeds of war.\" Alas, he learned that blind amity can have the same result.\nAs I progressed in my studies I began to notice cracks in the Psijic code, chief among them being the order's all-consuming passivity. Like a bemused turtle, it lumbered along quietly\u2014only occasionally poking its head above the grass to check for danger. Iachesis began to look inward, and our detachment from the affairs of &lt;a href=\"Tamriel\"&gt;Tamriel&lt;/a&gt; seemed to grow with each passing year. I still don't know why the Ritemaster began this march toward isolation, but our emissaries and advisors started returning one by one. The mist around the island grew thicker, and the petitions of kings came less frequently. We suffered from an overabundance of caution when it came to matters beyond the shores of Artaeum. This caution came at a high price.\nOne brisk Frostfall evening, I found myself wandering amidst the ancient stones of the &lt;a href=\"Ceporah%20Tower%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Ceporah Tower&lt;/a&gt;. In that place, time itself feels sealed in amber. Stiff wind whistles through the timeworn masonry, and the dull hum of &lt;a href=\"the%20Dreaming%20Cave\"&gt;the Dreaming Cave&lt;/a&gt; can be felt through the soles of your boots. It is a place of power, where law and reason give way to the sublime mysteries of creation. It was there, hidden within its torch-lit halls, that I found Mannimarco channeling the powers of darkness. He had taken up the profane practice of necromancy in secret and urged me to join him. I refused and prepared to sunder his rituals with spells of banishing. Just as I began to weave my spell, the tower lurched around us\u2014the drone of the Dreaming Cave grew urgent and bitter. Feeling the Island's anger all around us, we resolved to settle our dispute with the Ritemaster the next morning.\nStanding before &lt;a href=\"Iachesis\"&gt;Iachesis&lt;/a&gt;, Mannimarco made an impassioned plea to permit the study of necromancy. When Iachesis refused, Mannimarco grew belligerent and vile. He spat curses and ancient blasphemies like a Daedric beast. I stood by, all the while convinced that the Ritemaster would lock Mannimarco away. But Iachesis did not lock him away. He scolded him, stripped him of his gray robes, and banished him from the island.\n\"You would unleash this broken Mer upon the people of Tamriel?\" I shouted.\nIachesis said nothing. He merely lifted his hand and showered Mannimarco in radiant purple light. Then, just like that, my rival was gone. I stood there, aghast. The Mer I most admired had thrown open the gates of a wolf's cage and set the beast loose on a world of gentle sheep. Now, in the wake of the Planemeld, we see the grim result of Iachesis's mercy.\nI left Artaeum shortly thereafter. I remember looking over my shoulder and seeing its great cliffs and rolling pastures recede into the fog. I learned later that the island vanished just hours after I departed. It's difficult to see that as coincidence. Perhaps Iachesis recognized his folly and went into seclusion. Perhaps the Psijics knew what Mannimarco would unleash and chose safety over struggle. Whatever the case, the isle of the Psijics passed into memory and the once-proud order sank into obscurity.\nWhen they return, if they return, I hope they remember their oath to guide Tamriel toward peace and prosperity. In the meantime, we mages of the Guild must take up their mantle. Protect the helpless, seek out new spells and new discoveries, and above all, be brave.

Arthago was born feeble and weak, much to the dismay of his parents. Despite this, Arthago had went on the path of a scholar and showed much appreciation for history.\nHistory.\nBiography.\nArthago was the firstborn of the King Camaron and Queen Akorithi, and so he was the Crown Prince of the Forebear Kingdom of Sentinel to succeed from his father. However, Arthago was born with bad health, very unideal for the Redguard people. The master healers and apothecaries of Western Tamriel were unable to completely heal Arthago, but while they saved his life, time and time again, they were never able to cure his sickly nature. His parents did not show any affection to him, who were embarrassed by their feeble son. One of his closest friends was a Priest of &lt;a href=\"Stendarr\"&gt;Stendarr&lt;/a&gt;, who claimed that Arthago would have been the first Scholar-King of Sentinel. His younger sister, &lt;a href=\"Aubk%27i\"&gt;Aubk'i&lt;/a&gt; was favored by everyone, including Arthago. As time went on, the family introduced &lt;a href=\"Greklith\"&gt;Greklith&lt;/a&gt;, the unofficial Crown Prince, and &lt;a href=\"Lhotun\"&gt;Lhotun&lt;/a&gt;, whose name in &lt;a href=\"Yoku\"&gt;Yoku&lt;/a&gt; means \"Second Boy.\" Following this in &lt;a href=\"3E%20400\"&gt;3E 400&lt;/a&gt;, Arthago had been inflicted by a very serious flu, one that his healers were beginning to lose hope. But Arthago persevered and for the first time, King Camaron, his father did not show indifference but was disgusted.\nOne night, Arthago was kidnapped by a group of men, hired by Camaron, during one of his nightly walks. Arthago was taken deep into the Kingdom of Sentinel, far from the capital city, into an &lt;a href=\"Dungeons%20%28Daggerfall%29\"&gt;unknown dungeon&lt;/a&gt;, where he would remain in his final days. Arthago had lived with no hope, few regrets, but with no fear. He recounted his life on a death certificate as a historical document for the future. He ultimately died in the dungeon as his family continued without him.\nLegacy.\nArthago was forgotten by the Kingdom of Sentinel, with no mention of him. But he was not entirely lost, his youngest brother, Lhotun had become interested in Arthago's story. He was only three when he was around. Whenever the young prince asked about his eldest brother, he was told various stories, one including where Arthago was kidnapped by the &lt;a href=\"Underking\"&gt;Underking&lt;/a&gt;. Prince Lhotun had enlisted the help of &lt;a href=\"The%20Agent\"&gt;An Agent&lt;/a&gt; of the &lt;a href=\"Blades\"&gt;Blades&lt;/a&gt;, who was sent by &lt;a href=\"Uriel%20Septim%20VII\"&gt;Uriel Septim VII&lt;/a&gt; to investigate the &lt;a href=\"Iliac%20Bay\"&gt;Iliac Bay&lt;/a&gt; and the ghost of &lt;a href=\"King%20Lysandus\"&gt;King Lysandus&lt;/a&gt;. Lhotun tasked the Agent with proof of Arthago, in exchange for intel on Lysandus. An Agent of the Underking had sent the Blades Agent to Arthago's prison, where they would learn of his fate. The note was returned to Lhotun, who fulfilled his part of the agreement.\nLhotun showed great pity for Arthago, and so when he inherited the throne of Sentinel, King Lhotun had sent his soldiers to apprehend those involved in Arthago's kidnapping. However, most of them were killed. One was killed by the &lt;a href=\"Selenu%20Clan\"&gt;Selenu Clan&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"Vampires\"&gt;Vampires&lt;/a&gt;, another was killed by the disease that took Akorithi and Greklith, and the last one was killed by burglars. The last one, &lt;a href=\"Jomic\"&gt;Jomic&lt;/a&gt; was the only one captured and persecuted by Lhotun's guard."}

Once he is defeated, you and Narsis Dren can enter the treasure vault.\nCombat.\nAs a dragon priest, Arthosiis is considerably powerful, and is the only boss found in Exile's Barrow, making him the most powerful enemy in the tomb. He uses a combination of shock and frost attacks. At long range, Arthosiis will use lightning, and can teleport to you using a lightning spell that covers a large circumference. With frost, he will cast another circular spell, which will stay on the floor for around 10 seconds, and deal a significant amount of damage."}

The Agent is duly sent to investigate the rumor, and will be given as much time as they need to do so.\nHeir to the Witch.\nThe Witch can be found part way into the dungeon.

However, the Agent must kidnap her great granddaughter from her parents in a nearby palace, for the Witch has no heir and the parents are ignorant of the child's heritage.\nKidnapping a child.\nThe Hero will be directed to a town with a palace, with the child found on the floor close to the entrance. Upon picking up the child the Palace guards, a group of &lt;a href=\"Battlemage%20%28Enemy%29\"&gt;Battlemages&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Knight%20%28Enemy%29\"&gt;Knights&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Warrior%20%28Daggerfall%29\"&gt;Warriors&lt;/a&gt; will appear, largely due to the child as she wails:\nIf one of the guards lands a blow on the Agent there will be a more general alarm to the knights of the town, while a second blow will see the guard issue following ultimatum:\nThe Agent will have to either hand the child over, failing the quest, or make their escape, meaning the guards will follow them out of the town. Escaping with the child into the dungeon, and duly delivering her to the Witch is the only way to get the location of the artifact.\nAged artifact.\nThe Dungeon the Witch points the Agent to will be littered with rusty equipment, as well as random &lt;a href=\"Creatures%20%28Daggerfall%29\"&gt;creatures&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Enemies%20%28Daggerfall%29\"&gt;enemies&lt;/a&gt;. Looking at the various pieces of equipment (using \"info-mode\") is the only way to identify whether the artifact is there, or if the pile is just useless junk. If the Hero picks up the artifact, they will receive a message telling them that they have completed the quest.\nRewards.\nThe best possible outcome for the quest is to escape being hit by the guards at all, as doing so will incur a huge penalty to the Agent's &lt;a href=\"reputation%20%28Daggerfall%29\"&gt;reputation&lt;/a&gt;. The reward will either be Auriel's Bow, Auriel's Shield or the Lord's Mail, and is the only means of obtaining these items. Conversely, handing the child over will fail the quest, but will see the Agent gain reputation across the &lt;a href=\"Regions%20%28Daggerfall%29\"&gt;region&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe Agent will also receive a boost to their reputation within the Order for completing the quest at all, while penalties for failing the quest remain true to the Order's standards:\nIf the Agent is hit by the guards, but refuses to hand the child over, then their reputation will also change by:\nIf the Agent is struck by the guards and duly hands the child over then their reputation will change by:"}

But then they decided to hire me and other members of my clan to work on their cave complex. Well, as long as the gold keeps flowing, this Orc has no problem working for the priest and his followers\u2014even if I do find them all to be kind of creepy.\nI've never carved such intricate bas-reliefs before. It's been quite a challenge, telling a story across a number of sculpted panels. But the priest was quite adamant about what he wanted me to depict, so I did my best. He was even open to a few suggestions I made to improve the \nstorytelling.\nNearly done with this job. I'll be glad to be done with this place. The work was interesting and the pay was good, but once I found out we were actually building a burial chamber, I started to have second thoughts about my involvement. My clan was never comfortable with the dead. And the priest, he makes me nervous. He has a strange look about him. But I'm pretty proud of what I was actually able to accomplish with the stone. If all goes well, I'll be finished with my portion of this project tomorrow. Then I can head home.\nAt the last moment, the &lt;a href=\"Dragon%20Priests%20%28Online%29\"&gt;priest&lt;/a&gt; demanded I craft four smaller versions of the large bas-reliefs I just completed. After some negotiation, I was able to convince him to let me use one interesting aspect of each bas-relief panel. He has his followers building some sort of clever locking mechanism. Dwarven nonsense, if you ask me, with weights and buttons and all. He wants the smaller panels for this new device they're installing.\nSome of the other Orc workers mentioned they heard stories of tombs like this getting built in &lt;a href=\"Skyrim%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Skyrim&lt;/a&gt;. Said that the workers were eliminated when the job was complete in order to protect the secrets of the tomb. Sounds like a bad hearth-wife story to me."}

The &lt;a href=\"Souls\"&gt;soul&lt;/a&gt; that gives the quest will then teach the Dragonborn the spell to summon Arvak, whether within the Soul Cairn or in &lt;a href=\"Tamriel\"&gt;Tamriel&lt;/a&gt;.\nPhysical appearance.\nArvak's body is skeletal in appearance, his eyes glow white, and his mane and tail burn with a purple flame effect similar to that found in &lt;a href=\"Bound%20Sword%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;bound weaponry&lt;/a&gt;.\nInteractions.\n&lt;a href=\"Find%20Arvak%27s%20Skull\"&gt;Find Arvak's Skull&lt;/a&gt;.\nUpon entering the Soul Cairn, when following the initial path that leads to the entrance to the &lt;a href=\"Soul%20Cairn%20%28Dawnguard%29%23Boneyard\"&gt;Boneyard&lt;/a&gt;, the Dragonborn will come across a frantic Soul calling, \"Arvak, Arvak!\" He will explain how he and his loyal steed, Arvak, came to this realm and were attacked by monsters. He says he told Arvak to run, that Arvak is still running, and has been for a long time.\nHe begs the Dragonborn to find Arvak and disappears. &lt;a href=\"Arvak%27s%20Skull\"&gt;Arvak's skull&lt;/a&gt; must be located in the Soul Cairn to free him, though Arvak can occasionally be seen running through the Soul Cairn.\nArvak's skull can be found due east from the front gate of the Boneyard where &lt;a href=\"Valerica\"&gt;Valerica&lt;/a&gt; is found. It will be sitting on a pedestal surrounded by ghosts that turn into &lt;a href=\"Mistman\"&gt;Mistmen&lt;/a&gt;. After obtaining the skull, the soul who was looking for the horse will appear nearby and teach the Dragonborn how to &lt;a href=\"summon%20Arvak\"&gt;summon Arvak&lt;/a&gt;.\nTrusty steed.\nOnce the spell to summon Arvak is gained, he can be summoned in either the Soul Cairn or in the wilds of &lt;a href=\"Skyrim\"&gt;Skyrim&lt;/a&gt;. He cannot, however, be summoned in any walled cities like &lt;a href=\"Whiterun%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Whiterun&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"Solitude%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Solitude&lt;/a&gt;.

The spell will start to loop, and the 'Active Effects' tab counts down from five seconds repeatedly until Arvak is dismounted, at which point the spell's effect will count down normally.\nHe behaves like other summoned creatures, rather than the variety of horses available. For example, rather than staying in one place, Arvak will follow the Dragonborn when not being ridden. If he dies in combat, he can be re-summoned, adding to his usefulness. Summoning Arvak and mounting him will replace any currently owned horse, including a purchased one, &lt;a href=\"Frost%20%28Horse%29\"&gt;Frost&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Shadowmere%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Shadowmere&lt;/a&gt;.

Valuable loot and a notable sum of money can be found within it.\nLayout.\nArvs-Drelen serves as the domicile of Baladas Demnevanni. It possesses four different floors and an entresol, where the entrance is.\nLowest floor.\nThe lowest floor contains one room, which serves as a prison and storeroom. The prison is equipped for up to three prisoners. The lock to the cell is level 65 and trapped, thus not easy to overcome. During the quest \"&lt;a href=\"Rescue%20Ragash%20gra-Shuzgub\"&gt;Rescue Ragash gra-Shuzgub&lt;/a&gt;\" said &lt;a href=\"Orsimer%20%28Morrowind%29\"&gt;Orsimer&lt;/a&gt; is held captive here.\nGround floor.\nThe next level houses three rooms. The one closest to the cell is a bedroom for a group of people, containing four beds. For whom this room is designed is unclear. However, it does not belong to Baladas, the only humanoid resident, as there is a much more richly endowed bedroom on the topmost floor where he resides. Here, the &lt;a href=\"Nerevarine\"&gt;Nerevarine&lt;/a&gt; can find the key for a door that leads to this upper level.\nThe other two rooms on this level are placed opposite to each other. One is another bedroom, larger than the first one, with only one bed, but having a feeling of neglect and abandonment about it, being almost empty. In the other room, several valuable items are stored in various containers, some of them locked up and trapped. They are guarded by two &lt;a href=\"Skeleton%20%28Morrowind%29\"&gt;skeletons&lt;/a&gt;.\nFirst and second floor.\nThese two levels consist of two large, circular rooms on top of each other, that are connected through two curved staircases. This part of the tower is accessed through a door with a level 50 lock and a trap. There is, however, a key to this door in a chamber on the ground floor, as described above.\nThe lower of the two rooms is nicely decorated but without any notable furniture apart from a small table and a chair in a corner. Tapestries and potted plants embellish the room, where also the pet Daedroth of Baladas Demnevanni lumbers.\nThe upper room is the most richly equipped in the whole building. It lies directly under the dome-shaped roof of the tower and seems to serve as the living quarters of Baladas Demnevanni, who resides here. Baladas also keeps his shock centurion here, possibly as additional protection of his already heavily guarded home. He owns a whole set of Master's alchemist tools. Many partly rare and valuable potions also stand on two shelves. Baladas owns a number of books that reveal his intellectual interests. A corner serves as storage space for everyday items like clothes, food, and dinnerware. The room is embellished with carpets and potted plants, and the luxurious bed and the ceiling height add to the impression of grandeur and wealth.\nQuests.\n&lt;a href=\"Rescue%20Ragash%20gra-Shuzgub\"&gt;Rescue Ragash gra-Shuzgub&lt;/a&gt;.\nArvs-Drelen's inhabitant, Baladas, is enraged by the legionnaire Ragash gra-Shuzgub's attempt to collect taxes from him. Thus, he imprisons her in a cell in his cellar, until the Nerevarine frees her in the course of the quest.\n&lt;a href=\"Master%20Index%20%28Quest%29\"&gt;Master Index&lt;/a&gt;.\n&lt;a href=\"Folms%20Mirel\"&gt;Folms Mirel&lt;/a&gt; tells the Nerevarine of &lt;a href=\"Propylon%20Index\"&gt;Propylon Index&lt;/a&gt;es, which can be assembled to create a &lt;a href=\"Master%20Index%20%28Item%29\"&gt;master index&lt;/a&gt; that would allow teleportation between the &lt;a href=\"Caldera%20Mages%20Guild\"&gt;Caldera Mages Guild&lt;/a&gt; hall and Propylon Chambers, discovered in the &lt;a href=\"Dunmer%20Strongholds\"&gt;Dunmer Strongholds&lt;/a&gt; located throughout Vvardenfell.\nNotable items.\nThe following rare and valuable items can be found in Arvs-Drelen:"}

The realms of Ascadia is where a majority of Vvardenfell's populus is located and is the political center of the entire sub-continent.\nDescription.\nGeography.\nThe Ascadian Isles is ideally an archipelago as it is made up several small islands such as the floating &lt;a href=\"Vivec%20City\"&gt;Vivec City&lt;/a&gt; Cantons and natural islands such as &lt;a href=\"Elmas%20Island\"&gt;Elmas Island&lt;/a&gt; and the Isle of &lt;a href=\"Ald%20Sotha\"&gt;Ald Sotha&lt;/a&gt;. The town is home to many towns and plantations that are sprawled across these Grazelands like the plague. Common areas used for farms are along the shore of &lt;a href=\"Lake%20Amaya%20%28Morrowind%29\"&gt;Lake Amaya&lt;/a&gt; and the minor lakes found across Ascadia such as &lt;a href=\"Lake%20Hairan\"&gt;Lake Hairan&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Lake%20Masobi\"&gt;Lake Masobi&lt;/a&gt;. The many houses of Morrowind, more specifically, &lt;a href=\"House%20Hlaalu\"&gt;House Hlaalu&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"House%20Telvanni\"&gt;House Telvanni&lt;/a&gt; use the land and the nearby cities of &lt;a href=\"Vivec%20City\"&gt;Vivec&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Ebonheart%20%28Morrowind%29\"&gt;Ebonheart&lt;/a&gt; for trade along the &lt;a href=\"Inner%20Sea\"&gt;Inner Sea&lt;/a&gt; and beyond.\nHistory.\n&lt;a href=\"Second%20Era\"&gt;Second Era&lt;/a&gt;.\nDuring the &lt;a href=\"Interregnum\"&gt;Interregnum&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"2E%20583\"&gt;2E 583&lt;/a&gt;, the city of &lt;a href=\"Vivec%20City\"&gt;Vivec&lt;/a&gt; was under construction and was half complete except for the House and Foreign Cantons. &lt;a href=\"Vivec\"&gt;Vivec&lt;/a&gt; of the &lt;a href=\"Tribunal\"&gt;Tribunal&lt;/a&gt; had fallen ill and was slowly losing his divine power. Vivec tasked an Outlander called the &lt;a href=\"Vestige\"&gt;Vestige&lt;/a&gt; to uncover the situation before Vivec loses power and the &lt;a href=\"Baar%20Dau\"&gt;Baar Dau&lt;/a&gt; falls onto the city. Through weeks of manipulation and deception, the Hound of &lt;a href=\"Clavicus%20Vile\"&gt;Clavicus Vile&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Barbas\"&gt;Barbas&lt;/a&gt; had the Vestige bring &lt;a href=\"Sotha%20Sil\"&gt;Sotha Sil&lt;/a&gt;'s artifact, the &lt;a href=\"Sunna%27rah\"&gt;Sunna'rah&lt;/a&gt; to him and used it to substantially weaken Vivec's Power, resulting in his spirit to leave his body. Barbas' plan was to enter the &lt;a href=\"Clockwork%20City\"&gt;Clockwork City&lt;/a&gt; to give Clavicus Vile the immense power of Sotha Sil. Vivec's lack of power caused the Baar Dau to fall onto Vivec City with great speed. The Vestige and Sotha Sil's apprentice, &lt;a href=\"Barilzar\"&gt;Barilzar&lt;/a&gt; traveled to the Clockwork City and defeated Barbas. Vivec's powers were restored, and the Baar Dau remained suspended in the air, albeit closer than before. The Baar Dau would later be used as the Prison of Vivec City and be renamed the &lt;a href=\"Ministry%20of%20Truth\"&gt;Ministry of Truth&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe leader of &lt;a href=\"Suran\"&gt;Suran&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Marshal%20Hlaren\"&gt;Marshal Hlaren&lt;/a&gt; became oppressive ruler that accused innocent citizens of ridiculous crimes to have them become slaves in her friend's plantations. A vigilante called the &lt;a href=\"Scarlet%20Judge\"&gt;Scarlet Judge&lt;/a&gt; began to rise into action to deal with Hlaren's heinous actions. The Scarlet Judge and the Vestige investigated the situation to find proof of her actions. The Vestige was able to find hard evidence on Hlaren and was able to prosecute her, saving Suran. The Scarlet Judge disappeared after that, and no mention was made ever since.\n&lt;a href=\"Third%20Era\"&gt;Third Era&lt;/a&gt;.\nIn &lt;a href=\"3E%20414\"&gt;3E 414&lt;/a&gt;, the Vvardenfell Territory of the &lt;a href=\"Tribunal\"&gt;Tribunal&lt;/a&gt; was under &lt;a href=\"Imperial\"&gt;Imperial&lt;/a&gt; protection as per order of the &lt;a href=\"Treaty%20of%20the%20Armistice\"&gt;Treaty of the Armistice&lt;/a&gt;. No settlements were constructed in the territory other than cities built by the &lt;a href=\"Great%20Houses\"&gt;Great Houses&lt;/a&gt; of Morrowind such as the cities of &lt;a href=\"Balmora\"&gt;Balmora&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Sadrith%20Mora\"&gt;Sadrith Mora&lt;/a&gt;. It was until in 3E 414, that &lt;a href=\"King%20Athyn%20Llethan\"&gt;King Athyn Llethan&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"Mournhold\"&gt;Mournhold&lt;/a&gt; revoked a Temple ban on trade and settlements in Vvardenfell. A new wave of colonization swarmed Vvardenfell and many settlements such as &lt;a href=\"Caldera\"&gt;Caldera&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Pelagiad\"&gt;Pelagiad&lt;/a&gt;. The capital of Vvardenfell, &lt;a href=\"Vivec%20City\"&gt;Vivec City&lt;/a&gt;, was soon populated by Imperial Politicians and eventually a new city was built alongside Vivec. The city of &lt;a href=\"Ebonheart%20%28Morrowind%29\"&gt;Ebonheart&lt;/a&gt; served as the seat of Imperial authority in Vvardenfell and leading the helm was &lt;a href=\"Duke%20Vedam%20Dren%20%28Morrowind%29\"&gt;Duke Vedam Dren&lt;/a&gt;.\n&lt;a href=\"Fourth%20Era\"&gt;Fourth Era&lt;/a&gt;.\nIn &lt;a href=\"3E%20427\"&gt;3E 427&lt;/a&gt;, the long-awaited &lt;a href=\"Nerevarine%20Prophecy\"&gt;Nerevarine Prophecy&lt;/a&gt; came to fruition, and it resulted in the death of &lt;a href=\"Dagoth%20Ur%20%28Character%29\"&gt;Dagoth Ur&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Sotha%20Sil\"&gt;Sotha Sil&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Almalexia\"&gt;Almalexia&lt;/a&gt;, and the disappearance of &lt;a href=\"Vivec\"&gt;Vivec&lt;/a&gt;. The Isle of Vvardenfell was Vivec's domain, his plane of &lt;a href=\"Tamriel\"&gt;Tamriel&lt;/a&gt;. From his personal city to the Northern Cape of &lt;a href=\"Sheogorad\"&gt;Sheogorad&lt;/a&gt;, Vivec has many devoted followers and has power across the region. It is more emphasized in &lt;a href=\"Vivec%20City\"&gt;Vivec City&lt;/a&gt; where the city's maximum prison is the giant meteor floating above the city, just waiting to fall, called the Ministry of Truth or the &lt;a href=\"Baar%20Dau\"&gt;Baar Dau&lt;/a&gt;. With Vivec's disappearance, the magic that left the Baar Dau suspended in the sky was diminishing and in &lt;a href=\"4E%205\"&gt;4E 5&lt;/a&gt;, the meteor continued to fall from the heavens, and it destroyed the city of Vivec along with a majority of the Ascadian Isles. The impact created a massive crater in Vvardenfell dubbed the &lt;a href=\"Scathing%20Bay\"&gt;Scathing Bay&lt;/a&gt;. The scale of the impact is unknown since &lt;a href=\"Red%20Mountain\"&gt;Red Mountain&lt;/a&gt; erupted as a result of the crash. The area formerly called the Ascadian Isles is no more, it is simply the Ascadian Isles."}

She wants me to assist him in a matter of great importance to all of the alliances.\"\nWalkthrough.\nUpon purchasing the quest from the crown store, you will get a &lt;a href=\"Letter%20from%20Lady%20Arabelle\"&gt;Letter from Lady Arabelle&lt;/a&gt; asking you to meet with her contact in your alliance's capital, which is &lt;a href=\"Mournhold%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Mournhold&lt;/a&gt; for members of the &lt;a href=\"Ebonheart%20Pact\"&gt;Ebonheart Pact&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Wayrest%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Wayrest&lt;/a&gt; for members of the &lt;a href=\"Daggerfall%20Covenant\"&gt;Daggerfall Covenant&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"Elden%20Root%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Elden Root&lt;/a&gt; for members of the &lt;a href=\"Aldmeri%20Dominion%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Aldmeri Dominion&lt;/a&gt;. \nHead there and speak with &lt;a href=\"Lady%20Arabelle\"&gt;Lady Arabelle&lt;/a&gt;'s contact, Jakarn. Jakarn will tell you that he was sent on a mission to get a set of medallions from someone named &lt;a href=\"Guild%20Scholar%20Valessea\"&gt;Valessea&lt;/a&gt;, but when he got to her place, he found that the place was ransacked, Valessea was gone, and so were the medallions. He has since found a contact that might know something about these events, and will ask you if you wish to travel there together. \nHop into Jakarn's cart and make your way to western &lt;a href=\"Vvardenfell%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Vvardenfell&lt;/a&gt;; just east of &lt;a href=\"Khartag%20Point%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Khartag Point&lt;/a&gt;. Jakarn's contact is a Khajiit named &lt;a href=\"Tarazka\"&gt;Tarazka&lt;/a&gt;; speak with him and he will tell you that Valessea has been kidnapped by a group called the &lt;a href=\"Ascendant%20Order\"&gt;Ascendant Order&lt;/a&gt;, a group opposed to the &lt;a href=\"Three%20Banners%20War\"&gt;Three Banners War&lt;/a&gt;. He saw them head into Khartag Point, and then through an opening covered by vines. Talk to Jakarn about all this and he will agree to head into Khartag Point together. \nHead inside. You can talk to Jakarn once there, but he will not say anything of note. Your goal is to look for the lantern Tarazka left behind at the cave entrance they took Valessea through; a cave covered in vines. You will find several indications that Valessea has been here, but beware of all the &lt;a href=\"Camonna%20Tong%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Camonna Tong&lt;/a&gt; crooks you will have to fight on your way. You will find the entrance to the secret tunnel in the center room, south of the water. \nHead into the Ascendant Order Hideout. After progressing a bit, you will hear Valessea call out for help. Follow the voice into the cavern to the east, and you will find her there. Talk to her and she will tell you that the medallions were invitations she made on behalf of Lady Arabelle, and that they would allow access to a certain location. The Ascendant Order burst into her workshop just when she had finished them, and took both her and the medallions here. They are led by someone called the Ascendant Champion, but Valessea does not know anything about this person, nor about the group's goals.\nHead back through the main cave and start looking for the medallions. In the center of the cave, you will find a note titled \"&lt;a href=\"Ascendant%20Champion%27s%20Orders\"&gt;Ascendant Champion's Orders&lt;/a&gt;\", that indicates the medallions were taken to the &lt;a href=\"Sareloth%20Grotto\"&gt;Sareloth Grotto&lt;/a&gt; using one of the boats at the end of the cavern; tell Valessea this and she will give you an enchanted shell that will help you track the medallions once you are in Sareloth Grotto. \nHead to the south of the cavern and use the boats there to travel to Sareloth Grotto. The boat will not take you all the way; you will land northwest of &lt;a href=\"Salothan%27s%20Council\"&gt;Salothan's Council&lt;/a&gt;. Head east of here and you will find the grotto at the base of the mountains. Talk to Jakarn before you enter; he will remind you of the shell that Valessea gave you, and that the medallions will glow if you concentrate on the shell. With that, head inside and start looking. At the entrance to the big room, Jakarn will tell you to use the shell; doing so will reveal one of the shells is in a chest across from you. \nThere are four more medallions throughout the cave. One of them can be found to the east, by the water. Head south from there to the southeastern corner of the room to find the third medallion. For the fourth medallion, you need to head west into the hallway. The fifth and final medallion is all the way in the southernmost room of the cave, with all the water. You will have to fight off a massive &lt;a href=\"Coral%20Crab\"&gt;Coral Crab&lt;/a&gt; before you can get to it, but once you have it, your business in this grotto is done. Speak with Jakarn and he will tell you the location of &lt;a href=\"Lady%20Arabelle%27s%20Camp\"&gt;Lady Arabelle's Camp&lt;/a&gt;, and will tell you to take the medallions there. \nThe cave's southern exit will bring you just east of &lt;a href=\"Vassir-Didanat%20Mine\"&gt;Vassir-Didanat Mine&lt;/a&gt;; Lady Arabelle's camp is just east of &lt;a href=\"Vivec%20City%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Vivec City&lt;/a&gt;. Head there and speak with the lady; she will explain that the medallions were meant to facilitate peace talks in the three banners war. They were to allow the delegates entrance into a secret location where the talks would take place. At this point, the quest will finish and the next one, \"&lt;a href=\"A%20King%27s%20Retreat\"&gt;A King's Retreat&lt;/a&gt;,\" will start."}

The elves were pushed back slowly but surely until they made their final stand in the Ash'abah Pass in Hammerfell. While victory seemed assured for the Yokudans, the elves realised their enemies had a weakness: their veneration for the dead. Even a zombified Yokudan was considered sacred, and they would raise no weapon against it, even to defend themselves. Knowing this the elves killed the Yokudan king and reanimated him, hoping it would compel the Yokudans to leave.\nOne of the king's two sons instead slew his undead father and the necromancer that raised him despite the protests of his people. He accepted the exile his brother sadly imposed on him. He founded a tribe of like-minded Yokudans who were willing to dishonor themselves for the good of their people. They became the first Ash'abah.\nDecades later, necromancers threatened the Alik'r again, this time with an army of risen dead. The Yokudans would not defend themselves and were being butchered. It was then that the Ash'abah returned from their exile, led by the king's exiled brother, and drove the necromancers back. They then returned to their exile in the Alik'r desert.\nSo it has been since that day that whenever undead threaten Hammerfell, the people accept the aid of the Ash'abah warriors, albeit grudgingly as the Redguards still view them as dishonorable. In response to the dislike, a common saying among the Ash'abah is \"True honor need not be named.\""}

Specifically, my curiosity lies within the mysterious language found throughout the forest, inscriptions etched within decayed ruins. This language is unknown, unstudied, and largely unquestioned. I suspect this has much to do with the hazards the forest possesses, rather than an inability to properly research said language.\nThe forest twists, in a way. Moves as you walk through it. You'll see your destination, just over the foliage. Walk through one of the many archways, only to find yourself in a completely new location than the one you set out. It's some sort of teleportation magic at work, I suspect, though so seamless one can hardly notice as it happens.\nThe foliage is dense, bringing to mind a hedge maze more than a proper woods. It's obvious that someone, or something, designed this forest to be sectioned off. For the explicit purpose, I believe, of keeping outsiders out. What connection these protective measures have with the language I plan to study, I'm unsure. But perhaps, through my research, I can discover the answer.\nMy initial findings within Ebon Stadmont have been, as I've feared, inconclusive. I had once believed the language to be similar in form to &lt;a href=\"Daedric%20Language\"&gt;Daedric&lt;/a&gt;, but all experimentation to that end have yielded no results. Though this language may be similarly ancient, I do not believe it to have Daedric origins. And so, I fear that I begin my studies from the ground up.\nThe one blessing within this expedition has come from what I expected to be our biggest stumbling block; the forest itself. Have the rumors been exaggerated? All of our incidents with the forests twisting nature have been both few in number and minor inconveniences, at best. I've lost none of my troupe, as I once feared I may, though I've ordered them to stick close together.\nI feel a sense of acceptance. As if the forest has judged as worthy of uncovering its mysteries. Or perhaps the magical protections here have waned over time. Whatever the case, I don't plan to allow this good fortune to go to waste. Set backs are no, I am determined to research this language.\nFinally, the mysteries of this language begin to unfold. I was looking at it all wrong, that was my problem. I only saw a language, consisting of mere symbols. Something to be researched and translated. But these words have power. I see that now.\nWithin these inscriptions contain an untapped source of magical energy. But, try as I may, I cannot find a way to release it. To use it, the way I feel it so deeply wishes to be used. The kind of creative energy, full of an untold potential. But of what?\nThe words are alive. They speak to me sometimes, if I listen close. Words whispered in my mind. The power that has laid dormant for so long, willing itself back into existence. If only I could discover how."}

One of the earliest recorded dates, in fact, is the &lt;a href=\"Fall%20of%20White-Gold%20Tower\"&gt;Fall of White-Gold Tower&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"1E%20243\"&gt;1E 243&lt;/a&gt;, which is commonly assumed to mark the end of the Ayleids.\nAlthough Ayleid rule over all of Cyrodiil was indeed broken in 1E 243, this was only one of the most obvious stages near the end of a long decline. The first two centuries of the &lt;a href=\"First%20Era\"&gt;First Era&lt;/a&gt; saw increasing strife between the great Ayleid lords of Cyrodiil. &lt;a href=\"Alessia\"&gt;Alessia&lt;/a&gt; appears to have taken advantage of a period of civil war to launch her uprising. &lt;a href=\"Imperial\"&gt;Imperial&lt;/a&gt; historians have traditionally attributed her victory to intervention from &lt;a href=\"Skyrim\"&gt;Skyrim&lt;/a&gt;, but it appears that she had at least as much help from rebel Ayleid lords during the siege of &lt;a href=\"White-Gold%20Tower\"&gt;White-Gold Tower&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe popular image of the Ayleids as brutal slavemasters is based in fact, of course, but it is less well-known that a number of Ayleid princes continued to rule parts of Cyrodiil after &lt;a href=\"1E%20263\"&gt;263&lt;/a&gt;, as vassals of the new &lt;a href=\"Empress\"&gt;Empress&lt;/a&gt; of Cyrodiil. This suggests either that Ayleid rule was not universally detested, or that Alessia and her successors were more pragmatic than is traditionally believed, or perhaps some of both.\nIn any event, excavations at a number of &lt;a href=\"Ayleid%20Ruins\"&gt;Ayleid sites&lt;/a&gt; show continued occupation and even expansion during the so-called Late Ayleid Period (1E 243 - c. &lt;a href=\"1E%20498\"&gt;498&lt;/a&gt;). At first, many Ayleid lords continued to rule as vassals of the new human regime. In some cases, Ayleid supporters of Alessia were even rewarded with new lands taken from slain enemies. It is not clear to what extent &lt;a href=\"human\"&gt;human&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"slavery\"&gt;slavery&lt;/a&gt; continued under the &lt;a href=\"Cyrodilic%20Empire\"&gt;Cyrodilic Empire&lt;/a&gt;. Humans continued to dwell in the Ayleid-ruled areas of Cyrodiil, but there is nothing definitive to show under what terms.\nThis was an uneasy relationship from the beginning, and was not destined to last long. Resentment at the continued presence of Ayleid nobles within the Empire was a contributing factor to the rise of the so-called &lt;a href=\"Alessian%20Order\"&gt;Alessian Order&lt;/a&gt; founded by &lt;a href=\"Marukh\"&gt;Marukh&lt;/a&gt;. The first victims of the Alessians were the Ayleids of Cyrodiil. In the &lt;a href=\"Timeline%234th%20Century\"&gt;early 300s&lt;/a&gt;, the surviving Ayleid communities in human-ruled areas were obliterated one by one, the refugees temporarily swelling the power of the remaining Ayleid lordships.\nThen in &lt;a href=\"1E%20361\"&gt;361&lt;/a&gt;, the Alessians gained control of the Empire and enforced the &lt;a href=\"Alessian%20Doctrines\"&gt;Alessian Doctrines&lt;/a&gt; throughout its domain. The Ayleid lordships were abolished. Enforcement of this decree does not appear to have required much direct violence -- it seems that by this point the balance of power was so overwhelmingly against them, and their fate so long foreshadowed, that most of the remaining Ayleids simply left Cyrodiil, eventually being absorbed into the Elven populations of &lt;a href=\"Valenwood\"&gt;Valenwood&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"High%20Rock\"&gt;High Rock&lt;/a&gt;. Indeed, the rise of the &lt;a href=\"Direnni%20Hegemony\"&gt;Direnni Hegemony&lt;/a&gt; may be linked to this exodus of Ayleids from Cyrodiil (a connection so far little studied by historians).\nStill, a remnant Ayleid population seems to have survived the rule of the Alessians, because we hear of \"&lt;a href=\"King%20Laloriaran%20Dynar\"&gt;the last king of the Ayleids&lt;/a&gt;\" joining the &lt;a href=\"Battle%20of%20Glenumbra%20Moors%20%28Event%29\"&gt;Battle of Glenumbria Moors&lt;/a&gt; where the Dirennis decisively defeated the Alessians in &lt;a href=\"1E%20482\"&gt;482&lt;/a&gt;. How this king's people survived the preceding century is unknown. We do not even know who they were, although recent research points to &lt;a href=\"Nenalata\"&gt;Nenalata&lt;/a&gt; as the possible resting place of this \"last king.\" Unfortunately, in the current state of the Empire, funds are no longer available for proper scientific investigation of such extensive ruins, so the answer to these questions will have to be left to future generations."}

This is the Fourth Law of Gears, which teaches us that drudgery comes before inspiration.\nStrive to be more than just another cog in the gears of reality. This is the Fifth Law of Gears, which urges us to reach for even the impossible dream.\nYou have to disassemble the mechanism before you can fiddle with the gears.

Of all Dorell's many sons and daughters, none shines as brightly as Dame &lt;a href=\"Marcelle%20Stenric\"&gt;Marcelle Stenric&lt;/a&gt;, the Knight of &lt;a href=\"Shornhelm%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Shornhelm&lt;/a&gt;.\nDame Marcelle was a mighty warrior, brave and pure. She was a model of knightly perfection, a niece and loyal supporter of Lord &lt;a href=\"Aaric%20Dorell\"&gt;Aaric Dorell&lt;/a&gt;. Her exploits were legendary, even in her own day, as she defended Dorell holdings, battled brigands and monsters, and even negotiated treaties with neighboring domains.\nWhen a terrible &lt;a href=\"Troll%20%28Online%29\"&gt;troll&lt;/a&gt; shambled out of the hills to threaten Shornhelm, Marcelle was there to challenge the foul creature. For a day and an hour, the two engaged in a violent dance that knocked down trees and leveled farm houses. As the battle wore on, both combatants were bloody and weary. It seemed like the fight would end when one of them fell over from sheer exhaustion. But then Marcelle called on an inner reserve. She severed the troll's head with one powerful swing of her sword, Dauntless. And all of Shornhelm cheered.\nAnother tale tells of the time of the &lt;a href=\"Great%20Feud\"&gt;Great Feud&lt;/a&gt;, when &lt;a href=\"Berenda\"&gt;Berenda&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"House%20Tamrith\"&gt;Tamrith&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Ailex\"&gt;Ailex&lt;/a&gt; of Dorell (who was Lord Aaric's younger brother) engaged in an exchange of insults, each more terrible than the last. Insults turned to violence, and the two houses came close to the brink of war. At the height of the feud, Lord Aaric's son &lt;a href=\"Lanciot\"&gt;Lanciot&lt;/a&gt; was taken captive by brigands loyal to &lt;a href=\"House%20Tamrith\"&gt;House Tamrith&lt;/a&gt;. These brigands were members of the mighty &lt;a href=\"Hammers%20of%20Umbrage\"&gt;Hammers of Umbrage&lt;/a&gt;, notorious for terrorizing travelers on the roads of &lt;a href=\"Rivenspire\"&gt;Rivenspire&lt;/a&gt; until they were given letters of reprisal for pledging loyalty to the Tamrith lords.\nDame Marcelle, when she heard the fate that had befallen young Lanciot, never hesitated. She tracked the brigands to an isolated tower in the wilderness outside &lt;a href=\"Crestshade\"&gt;Crestshade&lt;/a&gt; and quickly took stock of the situation. A dozen brigands guarded young Lanciot, who was imprisoned at the top of the tower. Confident that the Dorell scion was safe and out of harm's way, Marcelle boldly strode into the brigands' camp and announced her presence. Just hearing her name was enough to rattle many of the brigands. Five of them dropped their weapons and fled as soon as they realized who she was. But that still left seven of the Hammers to deal with, including their leader, &lt;a href=\"Rhyne%20Succoth\"&gt;Rhyne Succoth&lt;/a&gt;.\nBrave Marcelle carried &lt;a href=\"Dauntless\"&gt;Dauntless&lt;/a&gt; with her, and she was confident the Divines were behind her. Brigands fell with every swing of her mighty sword, until only she and Rhyne remained standing. Seeking a way to get the upper hand, the brigand leader grabbed young Lanciot and held him between his own body and Marcelle's sword. Dorell's most shiny knight smiled. It was hard, humorless. \"Release the boy and you get to live,\" Marcelle said coldly. \"Otherwise, you die on the count of three.\"\n\"Save your threat\u2014\" Rhyne began.

From the deer his children slew, the man took antlers to make an altar, and his wife braided hides into leather rugs to cover the dirt floor.\nWhen the shrine was complete, the man and his family lit tallow candles and roasted an ox, pouring its blood onto the altar as they chanted prayers.\nSuddenly, they heard a laugh, and before them stood Hircine himself, drawn by the death cry of the ox and the scent of its roasting flesh.\n\"You've done well!\" Hircine cried, striding forward. He was clad in layers of animal hide, though his feet were bare.\n\"I am your faithful servant,\" said the man, groveling before his god.\n\"To prove your faith,\" said Hircine, \"send forth your seven sons and seven daughters.

Wind gently ruffles the willow trees. All is quiet, or it so appears, around the shores of the small lake. &lt;a href=\"Tamriel\"&gt;Tamriel&lt;/a&gt;'s moons reflect in the slightly rippling surface of the water. An owl's questioning call echoes. No lights are shining from the castle nearby; it appears deserted.\nAs the night wears on and the planet's satellites moves across the heavens, a faint glow appears near the castle. The light slowly moves towards the lake, and upon reaching the shore, stops. A figure, a beautiful woman by any measure, stands looking wistfully into the dark water. Her lantern flickers in the breeze, and illuminates her. Tears are streaming down her cheeks; her gown, once beautiful, is now tattered and stained.\nThe surface of the lake becomes agitated, but not from a wind as the night has become as still as it is dark. Slowly from the water emerges the figure of a man, a warrior, fully adorned in the armor of a knight on the field of battle. He seems to float over the water towards the woman and stop just short of her.\n\"Madylina,\" the ghostly warrior intones.\n\"My Lord, Gerthland,\" whispers the lovely Madylina as she kneels. \"You have come to me again.\"\n\"Yes,\" Gerthland responds, \"My days are long waiting for the night in which I can see my love.\"\nThe lovers stand looking wistfully at each other, unable to touch, unable to kiss, unable to satisfy their unrequited love until the first tinges of dawn start to color the western sky. Gerthland drops something to the ground as does Madylina as each depart. The waters of the lake again take possession of the handsome knight and the beautiful maiden walks slowly back to the castle. As the waters of the lake settle into a gentle ripple and the light of Madylina's lantern disappears, dawn breaks over the lake.\nOn the shore are two beautiful roses--one crimson and the other white as fresh cream.

Lord Gerthland's death on the field of battle. Lady Madylina's death by her own hand at the news. Hergen's curse on both their souls that will not allow them to rest until Madylina will agree to become Hergen's consort even in death.\nHergen, to this day, wanders the deserted halls of Gerthland Manor hoping that Madylina will agree to his demands.

Elements of the legend suggest a date c.&lt;a href=\"1E%201030\"&gt;1E 1030&lt;/a&gt;, though as with any oral tradition, much of it is likely a later anachronism. Curiously, stories of a similar king and his legendary blade appear in other ancient myths of &lt;a href=\"the%20Reach\"&gt;the Reach&lt;/a&gt;.\nLong ago, a child was born in the &lt;a href=\"Sundered%20Hills\"&gt;Sundered Hills&lt;/a&gt;. They named him Faolan, which means '&lt;a href=\"Red%20Eagle\"&gt;Red Eagle&lt;/a&gt;' in the tongue of the Reach, for the screeching bird-call that greeted his birth, and the crimson blooms on the autumn hills.\nThus began his legend: &lt;a href=\"Reachmen\"&gt;Reach-child&lt;/a&gt;, born under auspicious skies, his very name the color of blood.\nTen kings ruled the Reach in those days, and though men were free, the people were scattered and warred amongst themselves. The augurs foresaw the boy's destiny: a warrior without peer, first and foremost Lord of the Reach, chosen to unite all under his name.\nFaolan grew in years and strength, and it seemed the prophecy would be fulfilled. The banner of the Red Eagle was raised along the cliffs of the Reach, and his people prospered.\nThen came &lt;a href=\"Hestra\"&gt;Hestra&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Empress\"&gt;Empress&lt;/a&gt; of the South, riding to war. One by one, the kings stood before her. One by one, they fell aside, bending knee in &lt;a href=\"Imperials%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Imperial&lt;/a&gt; bargains or slaughtered on the battlefield.\nHer legions came at last to the Sundered Hills, and envoys were sent to bargain for their surrender. Faolan refused to yield the freedom of his people, but the elders were afraid, cast him out, and accepted the Imperial yoke.\nThus was stolen by the foreign invaders: his land, his people, his very name. In the years that followed, Red Eagle became known as the untamed spirit of the Reach, unbowed, unbroken, stained by the blood of his foes.\nHe gathered loyal Reachmen to himself, those who clung to the old ways, who yearned for freedom, and forged a new nation. Together, they fell upon the occupiers and the traitors by night, disappearing into the cliffs and caves each morn, evading capture. It was not enough. For every Imperial patrol and garrison they wiped out, yet more seemed to march from the green south to replace them.\nOne night, under a cloud-choked sky, the men of the Red Eagle warmed themselves over damp fires of smoldering moss. A huddled, shambling figure came to them, cloaked in rags, face cowled. Though his men mocked and cast stones at the stranger, Faolan sensed something, and beckoned. The cowl was thrown back in the dim light, and she revealed herself to be one of the ancient and venerable &lt;a href=\"Hagraven%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Hagraven&lt;/a&gt;s. She offered power, for a price, and a pact was made.\nThus was brokered to the witch: his heart, his will, his humanity. From that day forth, his was a spirit of vengeance, pitiless and beyond remorse. The rebels grew in strength and numbers, and none could stand against them. Faolan's eyes burned coldly in those days, black opals reflecting a mind not entirely his own. Two years passed, and the foreigners were all but driven from the Reach.\nSuch peace could not last, however, and a great host fell upon them, a swift army of invaders unlike any before. For a fortnight, Hestra's generals laid siege to Red Eagle's stronghold, till he himself came forth for battle, alone and robed in nothing but his righteous fury. A thousand foreigners fell before his flaming sword, and the enemy was routed. Yet, when night fell, so too did he. The warriors who came to him said Faolan's eyes were clear again on that final night.\nHe was taken to the place prepared for him, a tomb hidden deep within the rock. With his remaining strength he presented his sword to his people, and swore an oath: Fight on, and when at last the Reach is free, his blade should be returned, that he might rise and lead them again.\nThus was given for his people: his life, his dream, his sword. But when every debt is repaid in blood, these he shall reclaim once more."}
{"id": "76767", "revid": "3266052", "url": "https://elderscrolls.fandom.com/wiki?curid=76767", "title": "The Legend of Red Eagle (Quest)", "text": "The Legend of Red Eagle is a &lt;a href=\"Quests%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;quest&lt;/a&gt; available in in which the &lt;a href=\"Last%20Dragonborn\"&gt;Dragonborn&lt;/a&gt; must locate and recover &lt;a href=\"Red%20Eagle%27s%20Fury%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Red Eagle's Fury&lt;/a&gt;, an ancient hidden sword belonging to the famous &lt;a href=\"Red%20Eagle\"&gt;Red Eagle&lt;/a&gt;.\nBackground.\nRed Eagle was a hero of &lt;a href=\"The%20Reach%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;the Reach&lt;/a&gt; who refused to yield when &lt;a href=\"Hestra\"&gt;Hestra&lt;/a&gt; came to conquer. He made a deal with a &lt;a href=\"Hagraven%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;hagraven&lt;/a&gt;, in which he sacrificed his humanity in exchange for success against the Imperial invaders. His spirit lives on in a tomb south of &lt;a href=\"Karthspire\"&gt;Karthspire&lt;/a&gt;, where he waits for his sword to be returned so that he can lead his people again.\nWalkthrough.\nIn this quest, the Dragonborn is tasked with returning the sword, then fighting him. It begins with a &lt;a href=\"Miscellaneous%20Quests%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;miscellaneous quest&lt;/a&gt; to \"Find Red Eagle's Sword.\" It can be obtained repeatedly, simply by reading \"&lt;a href=\"The%20Legend%20of%20Red%20Eagle%20%28Book%29\"&gt;The Legend of Red Eagle&lt;/a&gt;\". It may be completed multiple times, but the Dragonborn will only face Red Eagle himself once.\nRed Eagle Redoubt.\nThe cave entrance is labeled on the map as \"&lt;a href=\"Red%20Eagle%20Redoubt%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Red Eagle Redoubt&lt;/a&gt;.\"\nThe cave entrance leads to a tunnel, where several &lt;a href=\"Forsworn\"&gt;Forsworn&lt;/a&gt; are found. Down the cave path are three Forsworn near the beginning of the cave. There may be two or three more as the Dragonborn proceeds. There is a chest and a &lt;a href=\"Potions%20%28Skyrim%29%23Restore%20Stamina\"&gt;potion of minor stamina&lt;/a&gt; hidden underneath the stairs about halfway to the top. After the enemies are defeated, the quest continues at the iron doorway to &lt;a href=\"Red%20Eagle%27s%20Ascent\"&gt;Red Eagle's Ascent&lt;/a&gt;. This doorway exits to a series of stairways on the outside of the mountain.\nRed Eagle's Ascent.\nOn the Ascent, the Dragonborn will be attacked by two more Forsworn. Afterward, following the side of the mountain to the right will lead to the &lt;a href=\"Sundered%20Towers\"&gt;Sundered Towers&lt;/a&gt; (to the left are a &lt;a href=\"Forsworn\"&gt;Forsworn mage&lt;/a&gt; along with several more Forsworn). Climbing the mountain (easy enough to do by using some stamina and jumping in the right spots) will lead to another Forsworn mage in a tent who will summon a &lt;a href=\"Frost%20Atronach%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;frost atronach&lt;/a&gt;. Four to six more Forsworn come out to help her, but they can be taken down easily if she is finished off first.\nForsworn Briarheart.\nAt the entrance to the Sundered Towers is a &lt;a href=\"Forsworn%20Briarheart\"&gt;Forsworn Briarheart&lt;/a&gt; wielding Red Eagle's Fury and carrying the Red Eagle Tower Key. Take both items. There are no more Forsworn to be found in the tower.\nRebel's Cairn.\n&lt;a href=\"Rebel%27s%20Cairn\"&gt;Rebel's Cairn&lt;/a&gt; can be reached by climbing Red Eagle Tower, lowering the drawbridge by pulling the chain, crossing to the other tower, heading down and through the iron door with the door bar, and then walking southeast across the fields. This is most easily done by following the quest marker.\nOnce inside Rebel's Cairn, Red Eagle's Fury can be placed into a pedestal to reveal a passage in the cave wall. Down this tunnel, is the tomb of Red Eagle.\nRed Eagle.\nUpon stepping on the seal on the floor, Red Eagle will awake and summon four &lt;a href=\"Skeleton%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;skeleton&lt;/a&gt; archers when he gets out of his coffin. The archers do not have to be killed\u2014they will automatically collapse a few seconds after Red Eagle is slain.\nStrategies.\nBefore stepping on the seal, setting out a &lt;a href=\"Fire%20Rune%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Fire Rune&lt;/a&gt; spell in the center of the last set of stairs (the one Red Eagle will come down first) will cause him great damage when he awakes. Running back up to where the cave wall was opened will avoid damage to the Dragonborn.\nWith a &lt;a href=\"Followers%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;follower&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Barbas%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Barbas&lt;/a&gt;, and a summoned &lt;a href=\"Flame%20Atronach%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;flame atronach&lt;/a&gt;, the easiest way to defeat Red Eagle is to let them do all the work. It is possible to just watch from where the wall was opened. The Dragonborn's team will take out the skeletons first and then start working on Red Eagle. The spell can be re-cast every time the flame atronach dies. By this time Red Eagle should be at least half-way dead. He can be finished off at that point.\nAnother way to fight Red Eagle with little risk is to have a follower good at fighting while possessing high sneaking and good archery abilities. Having the &lt;a href=\"Power%20Shot\"&gt;Power Shot&lt;/a&gt; perk is useful as each shot has a 50% chance of staggering Red Eagle for a couple of seconds. Sneaking into the room, awakening Red Eagle, and shooting arrows at him while pulling back will start off the damage to him. The follower will likely charge into combat, and Red Eagle and the skeletons will target the follower since they cannot find the Dragonborn. Shooting arrows at Red Eagle while he fights the follower will continue to hurt him. At some point, Red Eagle is likely to critically hurt the follower, who will go down to one knee. Red Eagle and the skeletons will not finish him off but instead start looking around for the Dragonborn. He can continue to be shot until he dies. Even if he spots the Dragonborn and starts toward them, he should be almost dead by this point, and using the &lt;a href=\"Unrelenting%20Force%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Unrelenting Force&lt;/a&gt; shout will push him away.\nConclusion.\nHowever Red Eagle is killed, once he has been finished off, the &lt;a href=\"Honed%20Ancient%20Nord%20Greatsword%20of%20Burning\"&gt;Honed Ancient Nord Greatsword of Burning&lt;/a&gt; can be looted from his corpse. Behind his coffin, there is a chest and some shelves containing loot.\u00a0This chest is also one of the possible locations for the quest item needed for \"&lt;a href=\"Shalidor%27s%20Insights%20%28Quest%29\"&gt;Shalidor's Insights&lt;/a&gt;.\"\nOn the way out, Red Eagle's sword can be retrieved from the pedestal that opened Red Eagle's tomb. The weapon has transformed from Red Eagle's Fury to become &lt;a href=\"Red%20Eagle%27s%20Bane\"&gt;Red Eagle's Bane&lt;/a&gt;. It is no longer a quest item."}

She sought a way to delay the release of a sentient soul upon death that it might be consulted, its knowledge recorded for the ages.\nIt is to this end that she worked with Mannimarco after leaving Artaeum, searching for a way to trap souls as one might capture lesser &lt;a href=\"Daedra%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Daedra&lt;/a&gt;.\nBelieving the secret lay with &lt;a href=\"Molag%20Bal%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Molag Bal&lt;/a&gt;, the two conspired to enter &lt;a href=\"Coldharbour%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Coldharbour&lt;/a&gt; and wrest it from the father of &lt;a href=\"Vampire%20%28Online%29\"&gt;vampires&lt;/a&gt; himself. Together, they hatched a plan.\nWith a brash courage known only to the young, Mannimarco and his followers held open a portal to the &lt;a href=\"Daedric%20Princes\"&gt;Prince's&lt;/a&gt; realm. Ever thirsting for adventure, it was Vastarie who entered its depths and returned with a cache of black crystals the likes of which they had never seen.\nTo Mannimarco, they were perfect. Small, capable of containing even the most willful of souls, and apparently indestructible. To Vastarie, they were deeply flawed, for &lt;a href=\"Enchanting%20%28Online%29\"&gt;enchantment&lt;/a&gt; was the only safe way to free a soul from their depths.\nEven so, she set about the task of reproducing the Stones, breaking them down, testing them with a variety of substances until, by happy accident, she created something new: the first &lt;a href=\"Sigil%20Geode\"&gt;Sigil Geode&lt;/a&gt;.\nClear as crystal, this new device was capable of holding sentient souls within its depths, but unlike the gems wrested from the &lt;a href=\"Molag%20Bal%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Lord of Domination&lt;/a&gt;, it was exceptionally fragile and would only hold its charge for a matter of days.\nOnce imprisoned, souls could be transferred between geodes, but applying them as one would a &lt;a href=\"Soul%20Gem%20%28Online%29\"&gt;soul gem&lt;/a&gt; effected a soul's release, instead.\nVastarie had found what she was looking for, but Mannimarco was furious. What use was a soul gem that could not be used to fuel an enchantment? He demanded Vastarie find a way to modify her creation to his purposes.\nRealizing her friend would never stop searching, and that further discoveries made with him would only advance his goals, she gathered up her research and left with &lt;a href=\"Telacar\"&gt;Telacar&lt;/a&gt;, her husband and a powerful necromancer in his own right.\nTogether, they fled Mannimarco's grasp, eventually hiding in an &lt;a href=\"Ayleid%20Ruins%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Ayleid ruin&lt;/a&gt; deep within &lt;a href=\"Valenwood%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Valenwood&lt;/a&gt;. There, they lived for many years, as quietly as they could while perfecting their art. For decades, they had each other and seemed happy\u2014until the day Vastarie left.\nIn the years that followed, she wandered the surface of &lt;a href=\"Nirn\"&gt;Nirn&lt;/a&gt;, exploring places of power.

There, she built a tower and took on apprentices, teaching them her particular brand of necromancy and furthering her research.\nUsing her Sigil Geodes, we bound the souls of lesser Daedra, postponing their return to &lt;a href=\"Oblivion%20%28Realm%29\"&gt;Oblivion&lt;/a&gt; as one might with a soul gem. We then worked on a way to manifest the trapped spirit into the world.\nEarly attempts had unexpected, even dangerous results. Geodes shattered, sending shards of broken crystal into the flesh of our fellow students\u2014misapplied energies bound the souls of the living into the tiny stones\u2014but as we studied we corrected our mistakes and refined the process.\nEventually, Vastarie had it down to a science. By applying a Sigil Geode at the moment of death, a soul could be suspended within its depths. Through applied conjuration, it could be drawn into an ectoplasmic shell where it could be consulted at leisure.\nShe wrote the foundling &lt;a href=\"Mages%20Guild%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Mages Guild&lt;/a&gt; of her discovery. Vanus Galerion himself came to witness her demonstration, which involved consulting an old groundskeeper who had volunteered to demonstrate the process.\nHe was horrified when she bound the soul into her apparatus, and when the process was completed, with the old groundskeeper was released and allowed to return to &lt;a href=\"Aetherius\"&gt;Aetherius&lt;/a&gt;, he was white as a sheet.\nSlowly, he stood to address the assembled students. He spoke with vindictiveness and an anger none would expect from his unassuming mien. When he was finished, he turned and left.\nSome followed him. None could blame them, he wasn't wrong\u2014the Sigil Geode was a dangerous creation. Misused, it could spark wars and bring about destruction unheard of in our history.\nVastarie was undeterred, convinced that Galerion's willful ignorance would lead to his undoing, but something else would gain her attention in the years to come. A vast ruin was discovered beneath her tower's foundation, concealed from sight and scrying by the power of a Daedric Prince.\nIn time, she walked into those ruins and never came out. Some of us still await her return.\n&lt;/poem&gt;"}

The Jerall Mountains proved to be too great a barrier, and northern Cyrodiil too poor a prize, to reward full scale Nord invasions. However, Alessia hired many ambitious Nord and Breton warbands as mercenaries with the promises of rich lands and trade concessions. Once settled among the victorious Alessian Cyrodiils, the Nord and Breton warriors and &lt;a href=\"battlemage\"&gt;battlemage&lt;/a&gt;s were quickly assimilated into the comfortable and prosperous &lt;a href=\"Nibenese\"&gt;Nibenean&lt;/a&gt; culture.\n&lt;a href=\"Alessia\"&gt;Alessia&lt;/a&gt; received the divine inspiration for her &lt;a href=\"Alessian%20Slave%20Rebellion\"&gt;Slave Rebellion&lt;/a&gt; at &lt;a href=\"Sancre%20Tor\"&gt;Sancre Tor&lt;/a&gt;, and here she founded her holy city. Sancre Tor's mines provided some wealth, but the poor soils and harsh climate of the remote mountain site meant it must be supplied with food and goods from the Heartlands. Further, located on one of the few passes through the Jeralls, its fortunes were subject to the instability of relations with Skyrim. When relations were good with Skyrim, it prospered through trade and alliance. When relations were bad with Skyrim, it was vulnerable to siege and occupation by the Nords.\nWith the decline of the &lt;a href=\"Alessian%20Order\"&gt;Alessian Order&lt;/a&gt; [circa &lt;a href=\"1E%202321\"&gt;1E 2321&lt;/a&gt;], the seat of religious rule of Cyrodiil moved south to the Imperial City, but Sancre Tor remained a mountain fortress and major religious center until the rise of the &lt;a href=\"Septim%20Dynasty\"&gt;Septim Dynasty&lt;/a&gt;. In &lt;a href=\"2E%20852\"&gt;2E852&lt;/a&gt;, the city was suffering under one of the periodic occupations by Skyrim and High Rock invaders. King &lt;a href=\"Cuhlecain\"&gt;Cuhlecain&lt;/a&gt; sent his new general, &lt;a href=\"Talos\"&gt;Talos&lt;/a&gt;, to recapture the city and expel the northern invaders. During his siege, Sancre Tor was destroyed and abandoned. Realizing the strategic weakness of the site, General Talos -- later Tiber Septim -- resolved to abandon Sancre Tor, and during his reign, no effort was made to rebuild the city or citadel.\nAlessian historians asserted that Sancre Tor was magically concealed and defended by the gods. Records of Sancre Tor's repeated defeats and occupations by northern invaders gives the lie to this assertion. The entrance to the citadel was indeed concealed by sorcery, and the citadel and its labyrinthine subterranean complex were defended by magical traps and illusions, but their secrets were betrayed to besieging Nords by the Breton enchanters who crafted them.\nOne enduring feature of the legend of Sancre Tor is the ancient tombs of the Reman emperors. Following the defeat of the &lt;a href=\"Akaviri%20Invasions\"&gt;Akaviri invaders&lt;/a&gt;, Sancre Tor enjoyed a brief resurgence of wealth and culture under &lt;a href=\"Reman%20Cyrodiil\"&gt;Reman Cyrodiil&lt;/a&gt; and his descendants, &lt;a href=\"Reman%20II\"&gt;Reman II&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Reman%20III\"&gt;Reman III&lt;/a&gt;. Tracing his ancestry to St. Alessia, and following the tradition that St. Alessia was buried in the catacombs beneath Sancre Tor [1], Reman built splendid funerary precincts in the depths of the ancient citadel underpassages. Here the last Reman emperor, Reman III, was buried in his tomb with the &lt;a href=\"Amulet%20of%20Kings\"&gt;Amulet of Kings&lt;/a&gt;.\nDuring the Sack of Sancre Tor, General Talos is said to have recovered the Amulet of Kings from the tomb of Reman III. Theologians ascribe the long centuries of political and economic turmoil following the collapse of the &lt;a href=\"Reman%20Empire\"&gt;Reman dynasty&lt;/a&gt; to the loss of the Amulet of Kings, and associate the renaissance of the &lt;a href=\"Septim%20Empire\"&gt;Cyrodilic empire&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;a href=\"Third%20Era\"&gt;Third Era&lt;/a&gt; with Tiber Septim's recovery of the Amulet from Reman III's tomb.\nSancre Tor has lain in ruins since the beginning of the Third Age, and the surrounding region is virtually uninhabited. Now all communications with the north are through the passes at &lt;a href=\"Chorrol\"&gt;Chorrol&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Bruma\"&gt;Bruma&lt;/a&gt;, and Sancre Tor's citadel and underpassages have become the refuge of various savage &lt;a href=\"goblin\"&gt;goblin&lt;/a&gt; tribes.\n[1] The is a competing tradition that St. Alessia is buried on the site of the &lt;a href=\"Temple%20of%20the%20One\"&gt;Temple of the One&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;a href=\"Imperial%20City\"&gt;Imperial City&lt;/a&gt;. The actual resting place of St. Alessia is unknown."}

He will tell you that the plan is to sneak in slowly and get the lay of the land; they are still going through with disguising themselves as Montclair's men. Skordo will tell you to head ahead through the secret tunnel into &lt;a href=\"Northpoint%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Northpoint&lt;/a&gt;. The tunnel will be in the area under the lighthouse. On your way there, you may notice the lorebook \"&lt;a href=\"House%20Ravenwatch%20Proclamation\"&gt;House Ravenwatch Proclamation&lt;/a&gt;\" lying on the ground next to a backpack, so be sure to pick that up. Either way, head into the alcove and through the trap door into the tunnel. The tunnel will lead you into the lighthouse; in the room just ahead, you will find another lorebook, \"\". As you head out of the building, Skordo will come behind you and announce that he is coming with you. \nHead into the city and start looking for a safe location to gather up. Skordo will suggest you use one of the houses. The nearest house, Innkeep Ballik's house, isn't big enough, so look on. The safe space you are looking for is Chirane Manor, in the center of town, northwest of the statue. After Skordo has confirmed that the place is clear of enemies, speak to him and he will tell you to go look for the rest of the assault team. They will be in various locations throughout the city. &lt;a href=\"Baron%20Alard%20Dorell\"&gt;Baron Alard Dorell&lt;/a&gt; will be in the building northeast of Davynu's workshop, &lt;a href=\"Countess%20Eselde%20Tamrith\"&gt;Countess Eselde Tamrith&lt;/a&gt; will be behind the buildings in the west of town and &lt;a href=\"Darien%20Gautier\"&gt;Darien Gautier&lt;/a&gt; will be in the graveyard in the southeast of town. The moment you reach Darien, you will be set upon by enemies; while you are fighting, Darien will tell you that he found the innkeeper before he died, and was handed the keys to the inn with the man suggesting something important was there. \nOnce you have gathered up your crew, head back to Chirane Manor. Everyone will be talking about what is going on; when they are done, talk to Skordo. Skordo will mention that Baron Dorell found in his son's journal that &lt;a href=\"Lord%20Ellic%20Dorell\"&gt;his son&lt;/a&gt; probably holds some responsibility for &lt;a href=\"Lady%20Lleraya%20Montclair\"&gt;Lady Lleraya Montclair&lt;/a&gt;'s succesful invasion of the city. He also mentions that Countess Tamrith heard voices coming from the inn. When you tell him that Darien has the key, he will tell you to investigate. Head upstairs to get the key. Darien was heavily wounded by the bloodfiends and thinks he has been bitten, so you should speak to Countess Tamrith instead. She got the key off Darien when bandaging him up, and will give it to you. \nNow that you have the key, head for &lt;a href=\"The%20Sloshing%20Tankard\"&gt;The Sloshing Tankard&lt;/a&gt;. Baron Dorell will be coming with you. Once you are in the inn, you will find loads of Montclair's soldiers inside. Head upstairs; the moment you try to open the attic door, you will find it locked, and someone from the other side will tell you to go away. Baron Dorell will assure the person that you are a friend, and he will come out. The person is &lt;a href=\"Blademaster%20Qariar\"&gt;Blademaster Qariar&lt;/a&gt;, an old friend of the baron. He will inform the baron that his son is not here; talk to Qariar yourself and he will tell you about what happened here; Lleraya gathered a meeting in the town square after sealing up the city and then cast some sort of spell turning many of the citizens into bloodfiends. Qariar will also tell you that Lleraya is holed up in Dorell Manor, alongside Lord Ellic Dorell. He will give you the key to said manor so that you can infiltrate it and take out Lleraya. \nThe manor is in the southeast of town. Head in and look for Ellic. He will be in the throne room, sitting on his father's throne. He will not be hostile; talk to him and it will become apparent that he has been placed under some kind of spell by Lady Lleraya. He will tell you that she is upstairs, so you should head there and you will find her sitting on the bed. She will try to seduce you and place you under her spell; to this effect she will invite you to head downstairs and dance with her. On your way downstairs, you will see visions of &lt;a href=\"Count%20Verandis%20Ravenwatch\"&gt;Count Verandis Ravenwatch&lt;/a&gt; telling you to break free of her spell. He will tell you that Lleraya has cast an illusion just like in the &lt;a href=\"Lorkrata%20Hills\"&gt;Lorkrata Hills&lt;/a&gt;, and that you should look for imperfections in her veil. He will direct you to the basement, where you will find a tear in the veil. Use it, and the illusion will break. Head back upstairs and you will find a hostile Lleraya in the main hall. Once you've killed her, an apparition of Count Verandis will appear; speak with him and he will tell you that unlike in Lokrata, you did not break the illucion, but rather you entered an illusion where Lleraya was hiding herself. He will also tell you that you and your troops should go meet him at &lt;a href=\"The%20Doomcrag\"&gt;The Doomcrag&lt;/a&gt; to finish all of this.\nOnce you are done talking to Verandis, the illusion will fade and Ellic Dorell and the other nobles will reappear. Speak with Ellic and he will say that he and his people will head outside and try to make sure the city will now be safe from these bloodfiends. Head outside and you will see a scene of Lord Dorell arresting his son and proclaiming that Ellic is dead to him. Speak with Baron Dorell when they are done talking to finish the quest and start the next one, \"&lt;a href=\"Puzzle%20of%20the%20Pass\"&gt;Puzzle of the Pass&lt;/a&gt;.\""}

Talk to him through the door and he will mention that the vault contains a portal emanating overwhelming power. He suspects it's one of the &lt;a href=\"Lights%20of%20Meridia\"&gt;Lights of Meridia&lt;/a&gt;, and he hopes to use its power in the battle against Molag Bal. Head into his vault, then talk to him again. He will ask you to go through the portal and find the source of power. He will also give you a token that should allow you to return to the portal should you get lost on the other side. \nHead through the portal, then cross the bridge on the other side. You will find one of the Lights of Meridia there, on a pedestal. Take it, and a projection of &lt;a href=\"King%20Laloriaran%20Dynar\"&gt;King Laloriaran Dynar&lt;/a&gt; will appear to tell you to bring these lights to him, as they can free him from Bal's prison. Anyway, head back through the portal and out of the library. The mages will be waiting near the wayshrine to the northwest. Speak with Telenger here to finish the quest."}

It later reappears in as part of the &lt;a href=\"Staff%20of%20Hasedoki\"&gt;Staff of Hasedoki&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Creation%20Club\"&gt;Creation Club&lt;/a&gt; content.\nContents.\n\"Yes, children, it is no accident that this land of &lt;a href=\"Tamriel\"&gt;Tamriel&lt;/a&gt; has been called 'The Arena'.\" The old man altered his position on the large rock that bore his weight, and straightened his long gray robe. Rheumy eyes lost their focus as they gazed out over the sun-warmed valley in the mountains of &lt;a href=\"High%20Rock\"&gt;High Rock&lt;/a&gt;. For a moment he saw a vision of ancient horrors instead of the fresh greenery of spring. A chill washed over his aged bones.\n\"Is this a suitable topic for the young and innocent?\" he asked himself. The young must be taught, but must they learn of such things now, when they should be playing in the sunlight? This is a tale for the dreary winter, with the wind howling outside a walled town and the doors and windows closed and bolted against the blast and cold and -- other things.\nHe glanced with affection at his two grandchildren: the little towheaded boy with a hint of mischief dancing in his eyes even on those rare occasions when sitting quietly, and his older sister. A serene lass, the old man thought. Her hair like a dark flame and her slightly pointed ears were the only obvious signs of elven blood. So like her grandmother, the old man thought. The past is past, and I'shira had brought him so much peace and happiness after a lifetime of battle. He forced his thoughts back to the present.\n\"Sorry, children. I was remembering things. Old people do that, you know.\"\n\"Are you going to tell us the story of &lt;a href=\"Jagar%20Tharn\"&gt;Jagar Tharn&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Uriel%20Septim%20VII\"&gt;Emperor&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Eternal%20Champion\"&gt;Eternal Champion&lt;/a&gt;?\" His grandson asked. \"That's my favorite!\"\n\"Not exactly, son. They were a part of it, in a way. As are &lt;a href=\"I%27ric\"&gt;I'ric&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Moraelyn\"&gt;Moraelyn&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Edward\"&gt;Edward&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Reymon\"&gt;Reymon&lt;/a&gt; and many others. Even the gods play a part. This is a far older story, and even the priests won't tell it my way. They have their own interpretations, and their fears as well. I'm too old and have seen too much to have any fear left, except that our people will forget. And forgetting is dangerous. So I, and a few others, carry this tale and try to spread it among the younger generations. You aren't really old enough to understand it all, but I can feel that my end is not far off. I must ask you to remember anyway. In a few years, perhaps, if I still live, we can discuss it again. If not, well, you must seek out others who know, and compare notes.\"\n\"You talk as if you are going to die, Granther,\" his granddaughter spoke up. \"That can't happen. You will live forever!\"\nChuckling, \"I'm afraid not, dear. But I have a little while left, enough for the story\".\nThe children settled back against the bole of a large oak, knowing that the old man could not be hurried. Leaning forward, he began:\n\"Long, long ago, before there were any people at all; even before the gods, Tamriel was chosen as a battleground by two -- things. It is difficult to find words that fit them well. I call them the Light and the Dark. Others use different names. Good and Evil, Bird and Serpent, Order and Chaos. None of these names really apply. It suffices that they are opposites, and totally antithetical. Neither is really good or evil, as we know the words. They are immortal since they do not really live, but they do exist. Even the gods and their daedric enemies are pale reflections of the eternal conflict between them. It's as though their struggle creates energies that distort their surroundings, and those energies are so powerful that life can appear, like an eddy in a stream.\"\n\"Do demons and trolls come from the Dark, Grandpa?\"\n\"Not exactly, son. The &lt;a href=\"Undead%20%28Daggerfall%29\"&gt;undead&lt;/a&gt; evils we know, and the &lt;a href=\"Daedra\"&gt;demons&lt;/a&gt; that live on &lt;a href=\"Oblivion%20%28Realm%29\"&gt;Oblivion&lt;/a&gt; tend to align with the Dark. Their natures are more akin to it. Humans and the other peoples of Tamriel, even the misunderstood Dark Elves, are more aligned with the Light. Our evils are not always of the Dark, but some are, and these are the truly dangerous ones. Jagar Tharn was almost wholly aligned with the Dark, and that is really why he was so monstrous. It was not because he was a black mage, as some would have it.\"\n\"Did his magic come from the Dark, Granther?\" The girl's interest was piqued by mention of magic. Her heritage is beginning to show itself, thought the old man.\n\"No, magic power comes directly from the energies swirling about both entities. These energies are impersonal and all mixed up. &lt;a href=\"Necromancy\"&gt;Black magic&lt;/a&gt; is more a matter of intent than effect. The &lt;a href=\"Mages%20Guild%20%28Daggerfall%29\"&gt;Mages' Guild&lt;/a&gt; holds that a &lt;a href=\"Fireball%20%28Daggerfall%29\"&gt;Fireball&lt;/a&gt;, say, directed against a creature intent on causing harm, is not black magic; but the same spell directed at one seeking peace is. In this, they are right. &lt;a href=\"Destruction\"&gt;Destruction&lt;/a&gt; of a fire daedra strengthens the Light and weakens the Dark just a little. In the same manner, destruction of a unicorn strengthens the Dark.\"\n\"What about the gods? Do they come from the Light?\" The boy's eyes were animated, but tinged with apprehension. He adored stories of the gods and goddesses of Tamriel's pantheon, and the heroes who served them.\nThe old man chuckled. \"The gods have an unusual origin, if some of the oldest tales are true. The oldest inhabitants of this world -- no one seems to be sure what race they were -- had a system of myths that they believed in for a thousand years. The people of &lt;a href=\"et%27Ada\"&gt;et'Ada&lt;/a&gt; believed for so long and so well, that their beliefs may, just may, have drawn upon the energies surrounding Tamriel to bring the gods themselves into being. If that is so, the conflict between the Light and the Dark provided the energy, and the et'Adans the structure, that created the gods of Tamriel. No one really knows since it was so long ago and so little survives from that time. It no longer matters; the gods have their own existence now, and mostly align with the Light, except for a few who are, shall we say, a little ambiguous.\"\n\"Why do we have to remember, Granther? What is the danger you spoke of? If the Light and Dark are so big and powerful, can we influence them? Should we try? What should we fight for?\"\n\"I see that your critical faculties are developing, Solara. That is good. The answer is simple, but quite large enough for mere mortals like us. The Light and Dark are evenly matched, and perhaps will never resolve their conflict. Mortals and the beings of the &lt;a href=\"Aetherius\"&gt;Aetherius&lt;/a&gt; sometimes can perceive traces of them. Therein lies the danger; to most of us the Light is more congenial, even inspiring, and moves us to behavior that we would call good. To creatures like us, the Dark is -- horrible. Those who have visions of it are often driven mad, and the ones who are not would be better dead. &lt;a href=\"Void\"&gt;The Dark&lt;/a&gt; is to us a monstrous emptiness, an emptiness that sucks the soul toward it -- to be twisted, maimed, and ultimately destroyed. What we can see of it seems utterly evil. Perhaps somewhere else this would not be so, but in our world, it is.\"\nThe old man paused to gather his thoughts, gazing once more at the fresh new life of spring.\n\"What we must do is never to forget that the Dark is always there, beckoning to the weak-souled among us. Should it gain ascendancy over Tamriel, through agents perverted by its awful attraction, terrible things could happen. All that we hold beautiful or desirable, even love itself, would be swept away. Peace and hope would be no more. For Tamriel, that would be the worst possible disaster. What I saw during Jagar's reign nearly killed me, almost destroyed my mind. When he was destroyed, I thought the worst was over, but it was not. The forces of the Dark are on the march again, and &lt;a href=\"The%20Monomyth\"&gt;new heroes must rise&lt;/a&gt; to join the Eternal Champion in the fight against them.\"\nThe old man and the two children sat in silence for several minutes. Finally, the children assisted their grandfather to his feet, and they walked slowly away. Toward home, and hearth, and lunch."}

The time has come to make our final assault and reach Montclair and the cursed relic known as the Lightless Remnant.\"\nWalkthrough.\nUpon completing \"&lt;a href=\"Puzzle%20of%20the%20Pass\"&gt;Puzzle of the Pass&lt;/a&gt;,\" &lt;a href=\"Count%20Verandis%20Ravenwatch\"&gt;Count Verandis Ravenwatch&lt;/a&gt; will tell you to tell the troops they are to remain here and should not proceed further up &lt;a href=\"The%20Doomcrag\"&gt;The Doomcrag&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href=\"Baron%20Alard%20Dorell\"&gt;Baron Alard Dorell&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Countess%20Eselde%20Tamrith\"&gt;Countess Eselde Tamrith&lt;/a&gt; will be near the portal; they will not listen to Verandis's strategy and will insist that their best troops come along to the Doomcrag. After you have spoken with them both on the subject, head up the stairs to go speak with Count Ravenwatch. You will be stopped by an ayleid spirit named &lt;a href=\"Wynaldia\"&gt;Wynaldia&lt;/a&gt;; she will inform you of the Lightless Remnant's history, and will tell you that if it is destroyed, the blood-curse that lays upon it will flow throughout the land unhindered. \nAnyway, head up the stairs and across the bridge and speak with Count Verandis there. When you arrive, he will be talking to &lt;a href=\"Gwendis\"&gt;Gwendis&lt;/a&gt;, telling her that the relic will call to her and that she should resist that call. He will not be happy that the troops are coming along, and will inform you of the reason why he wanted them to stay behind: the Lightless Remnant feeds on life; he fears that the soldiers will not be able to resist its call and will turn into &lt;a href=\"Bloodfiend\"&gt;Bloodfiend&lt;/a&gt;s. \nWhen you are done talking, Verandis will head into the Doomcrag. Follow after him and into the chamber ahead. The troops will follow you, but as they enter, an apparition of &lt;a href=\"Baron%20Wylon%20Montclair\"&gt;Baron Wylon Montclair&lt;/a&gt; will appear and turn the troops into hostile bloodfiends. After they are defeated, Montclair will summon two &lt;a href=\"Bone%20Colossus%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Bone Colossuses&lt;/a&gt; and a horde of risen dead against you and your allies. Defeat them too, and Verandis will try to reason with Montclair. Montclair however blames Verandis for the death of his wife and daughter, and promptly teleports away Gwendis, Countess Tamrith and Count Dorell. Speak with Count Verandis after this and he will tell you that they are all still alive, but that Gwendis's hunger grows and she will soon not be able to resist feeding on the others. He also warns that Baron Montclair will try to use you against him.\nFollow verandis up the stairs and through the door to the middle tier, then up along the side of the building. In the next big chamber, you will see Gwendis and the others trapped by Montclair's magic; Gwendis will tell you that she cannot resist the urge to drink much longer. Speak with Count Ravenwatch and he will tell you that the statues here in the room are being used to power the ward that is trapping your friends. The Count will tell you that he can try and dispel the barriers, but that Baron Montclair will likely send troops in to prevent that from happening.\nAs Verandis tries to dispel the ward, Montclair's troops will start coming in, among them several gargoyles. The attacks from the gargoyles can destroy the statues in the room, which will make it easier for Verandis, so try and bait them to use their strong moves near the statues. After the ward is dealt with and the enemies stop coming, the nobles will fall unconscious and Count Ravenwatch will praise Gwendis for resisting the urge to feed. &lt;a href=\"Darien%20Gautier\"&gt;Darien Gautier&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Skordo%20the%20Knife\"&gt;Skordo the Knife&lt;/a&gt; will come in at this moment, but instead of letting them partake in the battles ahead, Verandis tells them to take the unconscious bodies of Baron Dorell and Countess Tamrith to safety.\nTalk to Count Verandis and he will tell you to go on ahead; you need to distract Baron Montclair while he does the preparations needed to take the man down. Montclair cannot just be killed; that would break the Lightless Remnant and release its curse on all of Rivenspire. Verandis needs to research a way to sever Montclair from the Remnant while you distract him. Head up the stairs to the upper tier and continue along the path. In the relic chamber, you will find a hostile Montclair. Kill him. After you do so, the Remant will start to crack, and Count Verandis will show up. He will be tempted by the power the Remnant has to offer him, but he will resist, and tell you that the remnant needs to be taken to the plane of his master. \nWhen you talk to Verandis, he will tell you that he is going to take the Remnant to the plane of his master, &lt;a href=\"Molag%20Bal%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Molag Bal&lt;/a&gt;. He will ask you to tell &lt;a href=\"Adusa-daro\"&gt;Adusa-daro&lt;/a&gt; that she is now in charge of &lt;a href=\"House%20Ravenwatch\"&gt;House Ravenwatch&lt;/a&gt;, and that she should look after Gwendis well. After that, you will be teleported out of the Doomcrag. Talk to Darien Gautier here and he will tell you that you should head back to &lt;a href=\"Shornhelm%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Shornhelm&lt;/a&gt;, but that you should first speak to Gwendis. Gwendis has taken Verandis's death very hard; speak some words of comfort to her to finish the quest and start the next one, \"&lt;a href=\"The%20Crown%20of%20Shornhelm\"&gt;The Crown of Shornhelm&lt;/a&gt;.\""}

As they struggle to find a way to breach Angof's defenses, they have to fend off hordes of &lt;a href=\"Bloodthorn%20Cult\"&gt;Bloodthorn cultists&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Zombie%20%28Online%29\"&gt;zombie&lt;/a&gt; thralls.\nWalkthrough.\n&lt;a href=\"Vargos%20gro-Guthra\"&gt;Vargos gro-Guthra&lt;/a&gt; might find the &lt;a href=\"Vestige\"&gt;Vestige&lt;/a&gt; near &lt;a href=\"Dwynnarth%20Ruins\"&gt;Dwynnarth Ruins&lt;/a&gt; and tells them he has been looking for someone like them. They need someone strong, brave and capable. The &lt;a href=\"Lion%20Guard\"&gt;Lion Guard&lt;/a&gt; has need of them, go and talk to Commander Ales at the fortified camp up on the hill. Asking him why they have a camp there, he'll explain they are trying to keep Angof's dead poring out of Cath Bedraud. The rotting bastards are tough, that's for sure. Agree to speak to the Commander and head off to the camp.\nThe Commander explains the zombies just keep coming and he doesn't know how long they can hold out. He hopes Gabrielle finds something to help them sooner rather than later. Tell him one of his soldiers sent them here and is glad for some help. He is concerned as a few of the patrols haven't returned and Gabrielle is searching for a magical relic that will turn the tide. Offer to help find the patrols and he gladly take it, and if the Vestige run into Gabrielle, maybe they can help her too.\nAsking more questions to the Commander will reveal that the patrols where sent to guard the western ruins of &lt;a href=\"Merovec%27s%20Folly\"&gt;Merovec's Folly&lt;/a&gt;, the redoubt and &lt;a href=\"Gaudet%20Farm\"&gt;Gaudet Farm&lt;/a&gt;. Follow the markers to find all three of the patrols. Defeat any enemies on the way and after finding them a soldier approaches the Vestige and asks them to meet up at the &lt;a href=\"Lion%20Guard%20Redoubt%20Wayshrine\"&gt;Lion Guard Redoubt Wayshrine&lt;/a&gt;.\nHead up to the wayshrine and talk to Blithe Croque. He explains he was with Wizard Benele looking for the important relic when they were attacked by the undead and had to retreat. The mage said she was close to finding something and did some magic and vanished. She said that a nearby crypt contained a relic neede to defeat Angof and after telling Commander Ales, he suggested to look for the Vestige and tell them. To find the crypt, look for &lt;a href=\"Gabrielle%20Benele%27s%20Journal\"&gt;Gabrielle Benele's Journal&lt;/a&gt; at the campsite.\nHead over to the campsite and look for the journal, when reading it, it seems the crypt is north of the camp. Go there and look for Gabrielle. When approaching the crypt, the Vestige hears shouting from the inside. It's probably the Wizard so head inside to find her.\nShe is concerned at first about her looks as she hates meeting new people and not look good. And she admits she did leave her journal somewhere.. She is excited as she has found the Midnight Talisman and with that they can punch a hole in Angof's barrier at Cath Bedraud. We just need to recharge the beautiful little relic. She also came up with the name, it's a &lt;a href=\"Daedra%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Daedric relic&lt;/a&gt; and used to manipulate Oblivion portals. One can use the talisman to get past arcane barriers. It would be the key to defeat Angof - if its power wasn't depleted. We need to recharge it and then we'll finally get our chance to deal with Angof and take the battle to him."}

In these memoirs, I shall impart to you an autobiography of a foolish and failed attempt to achieve a great power. Walk with me as I break the bonds of propriety, throw off the restraints of the ancient laws of the arcane, and cast aside the bonds of magical ethics. For contained herein, you shall find the dying words of Vexis Velruan.\nLet it be known to you, loyal reader, that I remain until my dying moment, a student of &lt;a href=\"Magic\"&gt;Magic&lt;/a&gt;ka. But no typical apprentice, am I. I am one who has forged a unique path to the deeper understanding of the mechanics of Magicka. Through the infliction of &lt;a href=\"Destruction%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;destruction&lt;/a&gt; magic upon my own flesh, I have accomplished more than any student before me has.\nIt is by that folly that I come to you now, lucid as ever, fully alert in my faculties, and acutely cognizant of the sacrifices that I have made in my quest. I have long since lost the capacity to feel any physical sensation beyond absolute agony. I've become so accustomed to it, so detached from the feeling, that to me, pain is simply always there. You do not think of the air around you as a sensation, do you?\nHow is it, you ask, that I came to be what I am? It began innocently enough. I was once a healer, one of the most promising students of the temple. Which one? It doesn't matter. I was eventually expelled. Fools. You see, we had a number of patients interred in our humble sanctuary who had been infected with the Red Fever. My attempts to use the magical arts to turn the disease on itself were less than successful in their early stages. For trying to find a cure, I was cast out.\nIt was not long after my exile that I discovered the means to eradicate infection using the destructive energies of magicka. In my explorations of the school of Destruction I discovered that by pulling the elemental energies through my own body, I was able to increase the raw output of energy. From the experience of a lighting bolt surging through my own body, I was able to deepen my understanding of the raw forces of magicka.\nAt first, the pain was bearable. I directed only a minor amount of the energy back in towards myself. I learned to couple the destruction with &lt;a href=\"Restoration%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;restorative&lt;/a&gt; energies. It helped to abate the damage done to my body, but did nothing to stop the pain itself.\nAs my tolerance for the pain increased, I began to channel more and more through my own body. My understanding of Destruction outgrew my knowledge of Restoration. While it could still lessen the damage, it could not stop it. My skin became charred and blackened; it dried, flaked off, and cracked. I stunk of cooked meat. But I could not resist the draw of more and more energy.\nI became like a &lt;a href=\"Skooma%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;Skooma&lt;/a&gt; fiend of the worst sort. I no longer used magic for any practical purpose. I simply sought out more and more energy -- I relished the pain. Anticipated the moment when the energy and the pain would wash over me as one, freezing my flesh, burning it beyond recognition. My skin became a network of scars, sores, lesions, and burns. But it was never enough. Never. I needed more. More pain. More power.\nI lost my sight. My eyes melted into boiling pools of vitreous humor so hot that they left streaks of blistered skin as they ran down my face like burning tears. My right hand froze solid and shattered into a thousand pieces, when I carelessly bashed it against a doorjamb in terror, once I realized what had happened. The bones of both my legs shattered outward like broken glass, shredding the flesh and muscle surrounding them.\nWhile this may sound like a fate of terrible consequence, my dearest reader, I can assure you that you will never know what it is to be a creature of flesh and bone like I have. You will never have the degree of knowledge of frailty of the flesh that I have grown to know. I achieved a level of understanding of Magicka beyond that of the grand masters of the guild, but that accomplishment pales in comparison to the grander discoveries that this experience has bestowed upon me.\nPeople like you think that pain is to be avoided. Hidden from. Feared. Through my suffering and the numbness that now robs me of the ability to feel it, I can say this to you: Pain is a simple factor of human existence. It affords us the opportunity to feel -- to appreciate the temporary shell that our spirits occupy. Pain is the greatest gift that the gods have ever given mortal man.\nAnd now, as I tell you this story by way of a scribe, I am a stump of a man, wrapped in seeping bandages, never to know pleasure again. Even still, I have but one message to impart to you: Embrace what you are.\nGlory to lord &lt;a href=\"Sheogorath\"&gt;Sheogorath&lt;/a&gt;, for he has opened my eyes."}

The Three\u2014Lord, Mother, and Wizard\u2014are described below.\n&lt;a href=\"Vivec\"&gt;Vivec&lt;/a&gt;, the warrior-poet god and Master of Morrowind, is perhaps the most popular of the Three. He also tends to be the most public, and the people love him. His visage appears both beautiful and bloody at the same time, and he has made violence into an art form. Vivec the warrior-poet has darker aspects associated with primitive, ruthless impulses, such as lust and murder.\n&lt;a href=\"Almalexia%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Almalexia&lt;/a&gt;, also known as Mother Morrowind, is the patron of healers and teachers. She is the Healing Mother, the source of compassion and sympathy, the protector of the poor and the weak. Almalexia embodies the best of Dunmeri culture and purpose. She exemplifies mercy, and her wisdom guides the Dark Elves in all their daily affairs.\n&lt;a href=\"Sotha%20Sil\"&gt;Sotha Sil&lt;/a&gt;, God of the World-Mechanism, is the least known and most hidden of the Tribunal gods. Sometimes referred to as the Mystery of Morrowind, he is a Magus and the patron of artificers and wizards. Perhaps the mightiest wizard in the land and certainly the wisest, he is considered to be the Light of Knowledge and the inspiration behind craft and sorcery.\nTogether, the Living Gods are the pillars of the Tribunal Temple. They represent the power and discipline of the Dunmeri people, and rule with a combination of compassion and strict adherence to law and protocol."}

Away from the walls of &lt;a href=\"New%20Sheoth\"&gt;New Sheoth&lt;/a&gt;, they are called the Walking Trees. Gnarl are known for their affinity with the elements. If a Gnarl is struck by elemental forces of &lt;a href=\"Fire%20Damage%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;fire&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Frost%20Damage%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;frost&lt;/a&gt;, or &lt;a href=\"Shock%20Damage%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;shock&lt;/a&gt;, it uses that energy to grow stronger and larger. Fortunately, this effect only lasts for a short time.\nIt is the will of &lt;a href=\"Sheogorath\"&gt;Sheogorath&lt;/a&gt; that the Gnarl confuse and bewilder the unwary mage. To that end, it gains resistance to the element it is struck with, but becomes weaker to the other two. The wily mage will quickly switch between elemental spells to take advantage of this. Lesser wizards will suffer if they continue to use the same spell over and over.\nIn recent years there have been rumors of smiths that are able to use the amber sap extracted from Gnarl to make sturdy armor and weapons. As of yet, this gossip has not been confirmed.\nMore is not known about the Gnarl than is known. No-one has been able to determine the gender of Gnarl, or if they even have them. Young or immature Gnarl have never been seen. One academic suggested that Gnarl are born full-formed from trees that are struck by lightning. This absurd suggestion has not been confirmed.\nSimilarly, we have no knowledge of their diet or social habits. Presumably they feed directly from the sun and earth, like trees do. There are no reported cases of them communicating, even among each other. However, they do seem to have a truce of sorts with other woodland creatures such as the &lt;a href=\"Baliwog%20%28Shivering%20Isles%29\"&gt;Baliwog&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Elytra%20%28Shivering%20Isles%29\"&gt;Elytra&lt;/a&gt;."}

She fears that something might be wrong, so she wants you to set up a meeting with him. \nTo arrange this meeting, you must set up the signal the Drake uses when she wishes to meet with him. Just south of the crossroads, you will find an unmarked wall. Draw the Dragonguard sigil on it and Captain Regulus will agree to meet at the secret place. The entrance to the secret meeting spot can be found under the banners that determine which alliance is in control of the city. Approach from the south, and make sure to avoid the guards above if your alliance is not in control. Once inside, talk to the captain. He will tell you that he was not willing to meet with the Drake of Blades because of how much the daedra have corrupted him. \nHe has found out that the Daedra have found a key to something beneath the city and will ask you to help swap that key with a fake one so that the real key can be studied by the good guys. He has created a key mold; you just need to find some scrap iron to make the key itself. You can find the iron on the enemies throughout the district; once you have it, head to the forge in the southwest of the district and make the fake key. Once you have the key, you should make it look old by dousing it in acid. You can find the acid you need in the northeasternmost building in the district, guarded by a &lt;a href=\"Xivkyn%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Xivkyn&lt;/a&gt; named &lt;a href=\"Xorolagora%20the%20Shearflame\"&gt;Xorolagora the Shearflame&lt;/a&gt;. \nOnce the key has been aged, meet Regilus in the Groundskeeper's Storehouse in the northwest of the district. He will tell you that the real key is in an old counting house to the south. It is guarded by a xivkyn named &lt;a href=\"Zolgar%20the%20Brutal\"&gt;Zolgar the Brutal&lt;/a&gt;. You do not have to worry about him though; when you arrive at the counting house, you will overhear a conversation where Captain Regilus stabs the xivkyn in the back. Take the key from the strongbox you see here and switch it with the fake one, then head back to the safe house to meet with Captain Regilus once more. \nHead back to the safe house beneath the alliance banners and speak with Regilus. He will tell you to take the key and his report to the Drake of Blades; as for himself, he is too corrupted and may well become a liability. Therefore, once you are done talking, he will drink poison and die.\nHead back to your alliance's sewer base and hand the report and key to the Drake of Blades to finish the quest."}

He enjoyed all the criminal types who were his usual pupils at the stronghold, from the common burglar to the more sophisticated blackmailers, children and young people with strong career ambitions which the art and science of &lt;a href=\"lockpicking\"&gt;lockpicking&lt;/a&gt; could facilitate. They were always interested in simple solutions, the easy way, but people like Yana were always looking for exceptions, possibilities, exotica. For pragmatists like &lt;a href=\"Arthcamu\"&gt;Arthcamu&lt;/a&gt;, it was intensely vexing.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Redguard\"&gt;Redguard&lt;/a&gt; maiden would spend hours in front of a lock, prodding at it with her wires and picks, flirting with the key pins and driver pins, exploring the hull with a sort of casual fascination that no delinquent possesses. Long after her fellow students had opened their test locks and moved on, &lt;a href=\"Yana\"&gt;Yana&lt;/a&gt; was still playing with hers. The fact that she always opened it eventually, no matter how advanced a lock it was, irked Arthcamu even further.\n\"You are making things much too difficult,\" he would roar, boxing her ears. \"Speed is of the essence, not merely technical know-how. I swear that if I put the key to the lock right in front of you, you'd still never get around to opening it.\"\nYana would bear Arthcamu's abuse philosophically. She had, after all, paid him in advance. Speed was doubtless an important factor for the picker trying to get somewhere he wasn't supposed to go with the city guard on patrol behind him, but Yana knew it wouldn't apply to her. She merely wanted the knowledge.\nArthcamu did everything he could think of to encourage Yana to move faster. She seemed to perversely thrive on his physical and verbal blows, spending more and more time on each lock, learning its idiosyncrasies and personality. Finally, he could bear it no longer. Very late one afternoon after Yana had dawdled over a perfectly ordinary lock, he grabbed the girl by her ear and dragged her to a room in the stronghold far from the other students, an area they had always been forbidden to visit.\nThe room was completely barren, except for one large crate in the center. There were no windows and no other door except for the one leading in. Arthcamu slammed his student against the crate and closed the door behind her. There was a distinct click of the lock.\n\"This is the test for my advanced students,\" he laughed behind the door. \"See if you can escape.\"\nYana smiled and began her usual slow process of massaging the lock, gaining information. After a few minutes had gone by, she heard Arthcamu's voice again call out from behind the door.\n\"Perhaps I should mention that this is a test of speed. You see the crate behind you? It contains a vampire ancient who has been locked in here for many months. It is absolutely ravenous. In a few minutes' time, the sun will have completely set, and if you have not opened the door, you will be nothing but a bloodless husk.\"\nYana considered only for a moment whether Arthcamu was joking or not. She knew he was an evil, horrible man, but to resort to murder to teach his pupil? The moment she heard a rustling in the crate, any doubts she had were erased. Ignoring all her usual explorations, she jammed her wire into the lock, thrust the pegs against the pressure plate, and shoved open the door.\nArthcamu stood in the hallway beyond, laughing cruelly, \"So, now you've learned the value of fast work.\"\nYana fled from Arthcamu's stronghold, fighting back her tears. He was certain that she would never return to his tutelage, but he considered that he had taught her at last a very valuable lesson. When she did return the next morning, Arthcamu registered no surprise, but inside he was seething.\n\"I'll be leaving shortly,\" she explained, quietly. \"But I believe I've developed a new type of lock, and I'd be grateful if you'd give me your opinion of it.\"\nArthcamu shrugged and asked her to present her design.\n\"I was wondering if I might use the vampire room and install the lock. I think it would be better if I demonstrated it.\"\nArthcamu was dubious, but the prospect of the tiresome girl leaving at last put him in an excellent and even indulgent mood. He agreed to give her access to the room. For all morning and most of the afternoon, she worked near the slumbering vampire, removing the old lock and adding her new prototype. Finally, she asked her old master to take a look.\nHe studied the lock with an expert eye, and found little to be impressed with.\n\"This is the first and only pick-proof lock,\" Yana explained. \"The only way to open it is to have the right key.\"\nArthcamu scoffed and let Yana close the door, shutting him in the room. The door clicked and he began to go to work. To his dismay, the lock was much more difficult than he thought it would be. He tried all his methods to force it, and found that he had to resort to his hated student's method of careful and thorough exploration.\n\"I need to leave now,\" called Yana from the other side of the door. \"I'm going to bring the city guard to the stronghold. I know that it's against the rules, but I really think it's for the welfare of the villagers not to have a hungry vampire on the loose. It's getting dark, and even though you aren't able to unlock the door, the vampire might be less proud about using the key to escape. Remember when you said 'If I put the key to the lock right in front of you, you'd still never get around to opening it'?\"\n\"Wait!\" Arthcamu yelled back. \"I'll use the key! Where is it? You forgot to give it to me!\"\nBut there was no reply, only the sound of footfall disappearing down the corridor beyond the door. Arthcamu began to work harder on the lock, but his hands were shaking with fear. With no windows, it was impossible to tell how late it was getting to be. Were minutes that were flying by or hours? He only knew that the vampire ancient would know.\nThe tools could not stand very much twisting and tapping from Arthcamu's hysterical hands. The wire snapped in the keyhole. Just like a student. Arthcamu screamed and pounded on the door, but he knew that no one could possibly hear him. It was while sucking in his breath to scream again, he heard the distinct creak of the crate opening behind him.\nThe &lt;a href=\"vampire\"&gt;vampire&lt;/a&gt; ancient regarded the master locksmith with insane, hungry eyes, and flew at him in a frenzy. Before Arthcamu died, he saw it: on a chain that had been placed around the vampire's neck while it had been sleeping was a key."}

In order to receive the bonus, the execution must occur in a secure location, indoors, with no witnesses. They are given no more information about him except he likes to take walks.\nWalkthrough.\nSpeak to the other members and one of them suggests they talk to Faelian and try to convince him to go someplace private where you can eliminate him without witnesses. Head over to the Imperial City and talk to a few people, such as beggars or other Elves who should have some information on Faelian and they will tell the Hero that Faelian lives in the &lt;a href=\"Tiber%20Septim%20Hotel\"&gt;Tiber Septim Hotel&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;a href=\"Talos%20Plaza%20District\"&gt;Talos Plaza District&lt;/a&gt; (though the player may need to raise their &lt;a href=\"disposition\"&gt;disposition&lt;/a&gt; towards them). The hotel is not a secure location; killing him there will forfeit the bonus.\nTalking to &lt;a href=\"Atraena\"&gt;Atraena&lt;/a&gt; (with a high disposition), Faelian's girlfriend living at the Hotel, will get them information that Faelian is a &lt;a href=\"Skooma%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;skooma&lt;/a&gt; addict and heads to &lt;a href=\"Lorkmir%27s%20House\"&gt;Lorkmir's House&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;a href=\"Imperial%20City%2C%20Elven%20Gardens%20District\"&gt;Elven Gardens District&lt;/a&gt; for several hours a day to do skooma. The house is supposed to be deserted. The door has a hard lock on it. Break in during the day and kill him, and the bonus is secured.\nIt is also possible to talk to Faelian and if they have it, give him a potion of skooma he will become their 'friend' and gives them the key to Lorkmir's House. He also tells them what times he is at the house, between 11 am and 5pm.\nSkooma can sometimes be found (ten) in a barrel outside the house next to &lt;a href=\"Methredhel\"&gt;Methredhel&lt;/a&gt;'s, Myvryna Arano's house in the &lt;a href=\"Imperial%20City%20Waterfront\"&gt;Waterfront district&lt;/a&gt; and the barrel has an average lock.

There is also a Wooden chest (three) there. Skooma can also be purchased from &lt;a href=\"Shady%20Sam\"&gt;Shady Sam&lt;/a&gt;. To find him, head north from the &lt;a href=\"Imperial%20City%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;Imperial City&lt;/a&gt; stables, and look near the wall.

Speak with Walks-Softly at the harbor first.\nWalks-Softly.\nAfter entering the harbor in Abah's Landing, Walks-Softly can be found sitting in a chair. He greets the vestige and relays that the captain of &lt;a href=\"The%20Dreamsnake\"&gt;The Dreamsnake&lt;/a&gt; is a likely candidate of Cosh's blackmail. In order to confirm this, either eavesdrop on Captain Evani or steal his log. \nTo eavesdrop, travel to the indicated area southeast of Walks-Softly. Use the hiding area to hear what Captain Evani has to say. To steal Captain Evani's Log, head to The Dreamsnake, docked in the harbor south of Walks-Softly. Upon boarding the ship, pick the locked door to the right and proceed down the stairs. The log can be found in the second room towards the rear of the ship. Upon completion, it is discovered that Captain Evani is to meet with Cosh in No Shira Citadel or else the &lt;a href=\"Iron%20Wheel\"&gt;Iron Wheel&lt;/a&gt; will raid The Dreamsnake. After this is completed, go and speak with &lt;a href=\"Quen\"&gt;Quen&lt;/a&gt; to see what she has learned.\nQuen.\nAfter entering the harbor in Abah's Landing, Quen can be found sitting on top of some crates.

Use the hiding area to hear what Ventilias Proximus and Zulgukh has to say. To search his private room, head to the Serpent and the Senche west of Quen. Upon entering the inn, pick the locked door on the first floor and read the \"&lt;a href=\"Journal%20of%20Ventilias%20Proximus\"&gt;Journal of Ventilias Proximus&lt;/a&gt;\". Upon completion, it is discovered that Zulgukh is to meet with Cosh in No Shira Citadel, while Ventilias Proximus was using the citizens as sacrificial souls to join &lt;a href=\"Order%20of%20the%20Black%20Worm%20%28Online%29\"&gt;The Cult of the Black Worm&lt;/a&gt;.

Silver-Claw's friend, Percius Loche will assist in obtaining an appropriate disguise in order to enter the Iron Wheel's stronghold safely. Travel to The Diamond Thimble and speak with Percius Loche. He reveals two options for obtaining an appropriate disguise, either recover a servant's outfit that he was never paid for or purchase a similar outfit for gold.\nTo steal the servant's outfit, head south of the Diamond Thimble and pick the lock to enter &lt;a href=\"Sailor%27s%20Rest\"&gt;Sailor's Rest&lt;/a&gt;.

After obtaining the servant's outfit, head to No Shira Citadel to speak with Velsa.\nNo Shira Citadel.\nSpeak with Velsa outside of the Citadel. She states that Cosh has been blackmailing people in order to bend them to his will. Although, it is unclear how he is connected to the Iron Wheel. Velsa requests the blackmail documents be obtained. She also reveals there may be a pass-phrase to enter the citadel safely. Search the area to learn what it is. Upon learning the pass-phrase, use it to enter the headquarters. Choose whether to speak with &lt;a href=\"Varel%20Falavel\"&gt;Varel Falavel&lt;/a&gt; and decide whether to have him drink his sleeping draught. \nContinue down the stairs and eavesdrop on Cosh's conversation with Captain Evani and Zulgukh. They agree to work for Cosh. Steal the papers from the counter to obtain proof of Cosh's blackmail. Then follow Cosh as he attends a meeting with Chief Inspector Rhanbiq. Continue down to the passage, until finding a suspicious relief that leads to a secret passage. Eavesdrop on the conversation between Cosh and the Chief Inspector Rhanbiq. Cosh makes a deal with Rhanbiq to recover &lt;a href=\"Magnifica%20Falorah\"&gt;Magnifica Falorah&lt;/a&gt;'s missing dowry in exchange for the Iron Wheels leaving Abah's Landing. Cosh then invites Rhanbiq out for drinks to discuss a more \"trivial\" matter. Escape from the headquarters and return to the Thieves Den to relay to Zeira everything that was uncovered. After speaking with her the quest is completed."}

The only way you're gonna get it is if you do me a favor first.\"\nRejecting the Wizard's offer will make it impossible to complete the quest, so accepting their task is a must.\nThe Hair of the Successor.\nThe Wizard reveals that they do not know the location of the artifact, but that their great grandfather had all but retrieved it before the &lt;a href=\"Mages%20Guild%20%28Daggerfall%29\"&gt;Mages Guild&lt;/a&gt; took it from them. Unfortunately their ancestor has been haunting another dungeon, and their spirit must be put to rest. As a favour to the Agent for putting their ancestor to rest, the Wizard hands them a lock of hair, which will enhance the chance that the spirit will speak to the Agent upon its destruction.\nThe Agent must therefore plunge into a third dungeon, once again fighting through a random assortment of creatures and enemies. The spirit, now in the form of a &lt;a href=\"Wraith%20%28Daggerfall%29\"&gt;Wraith&lt;/a&gt; can be found within, and will utter upon their death:\nWith that, the Agent must head to the specified town to finally get their hands on the artifact.\nThe Wraith's Revenge.\nThe Agent will have to get into the town's Mages Guild, either during the opening hours or by picking/opening the lock. Once inside a search for the artifact must be made, although the more time it takes the more likely it is that the Agent will face the artifact's protectors: &lt;a href=\"Battlemage%20%28Enemy%29\"&gt;Battlemages&lt;/a&gt;. Once the artifact has been found, lying on the floor on its own, the Agent must escape the Guildhall to complete the quest.\nRewards.\nThe Agent will not receive any physical reward for completing the first part of the quest successfully, only getting the boost to their reputation. However, completing the second element of the quest will allow the Agent to obtain either &lt;a href=\"Chrysamere%20%28Daggerfall%29\"&gt;Chrysamere&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"Warlock%27s%20Ring%20%28Daggerfall%29\"&gt;Warlock's Ring&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"Staff%20of%20Magnus%20%28Daggerfall%29\"&gt;Staff of Magnus&lt;/a&gt;, or the &lt;a href=\"Necromancer%27s%20Amulet%20%28Daggerfall%29\"&gt;Necromancer's Amulet&lt;/a&gt;. There will be no reputation boosts for retrieving the artifact.\nThe penalties for failing the quest remain true to a usual quest:"}

The quest is obtained by reading &lt;a href=\"Alethius%27s%20Notes\"&gt;Alethius's Notes&lt;/a&gt; (found next to his dead body in the &lt;a href=\"Nchuand-Zel%20Excavation%20Site\"&gt;Nchuand-Zel Excavation Site&lt;/a&gt;). The player can start this quest by reading the note after killing the frostbite spider &lt;a href=\"Nimhe\"&gt;Nimhe&lt;/a&gt; during &lt;a href=\"Calcelmo\"&gt;Calcelmo&lt;/a&gt;'s miscellaneous quest \"&lt;a href=\"Nimhe%2C%20the%20Poisoned%20One\"&gt;Nimhe, the Poisoned One&lt;/a&gt;\" or during the &lt;a href=\"Thieves%20Guild%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Thieves Guild&lt;/a&gt; quest \"&lt;a href=\"Hard%20Answers\"&gt;Hard Answers&lt;/a&gt;.\" Also, &lt;a href=\"Calcelmo\"&gt;Calcelmo&lt;/a&gt; will ask the &lt;a href=\"Last%20Dragonborn\"&gt;Dragonborn&lt;/a&gt; to kill the spider if asked to see the ruins. The note is found right up the stairs from where Nimhe is confronted.\nThe Dragonborn can begin the quest by reading\u00a0&lt;a href=\"Alethius%27s%20Notes\"&gt;Alethius's Notes&lt;/a&gt;, which can be found at the end of the &lt;a href=\"Nchuand-Zel%20Excavation%20Site\"&gt;Nchuand-Zel Excavation Site&lt;/a&gt;\u00a0and close to the entrance to &lt;a href=\"Nchuand-Zel%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Nchuand-Zel&lt;/a&gt;, next to\u00a0&lt;a href=\"Alethius\"&gt;Alethius&lt;/a&gt;'s corpse. After obtaining the quest,\u00a0the Dragonborn must cut through a spider web to get into Nchuand-Zel.\u00a0The Dragonborn must follow\u00a0the quest marker to the Nchuand-Zel Quarters, with Falmer and traps being encountered along the way. Go down the first set of stairs and follow the path until reaching the dead body of &lt;a href=\"Stromm\"&gt;Stromm&lt;/a&gt; by a tree. After reading Stromm's journal the Dragonborn is now tasked with finding the three other journals of the missing expeditioners, belonging to Erj, Krag and Staubin. Falmer and Dwarven\u00a0mechanisms will be encountered throughout the ruin.\u00a0\nThe quest marker will guide the player back into Nchuand-Zel. From there, the Dragonborn\u00a0must go to the bottom level and swim to the door across the water to enter the &lt;a href=\"Nchuand-Zel%20Armory\"&gt;Nchuand-Zel Armory&lt;/a&gt;. (When crossing the main hall &lt;a href=\"Whirlwind%20Sprint\"&gt;Whirlwind Sprint&lt;/a&gt; could be used as a shortcut to get to the door of the armory.) Once inside, the path to the left\u00a0will lead to a\u00a0locked gate. Once unlocking the gate,\u00a0the Dragonborn will climb a flight of stairs and\u00a0find Erj's dead body and his journal, and a chest with leveled loot. After reading his journal, the Dragonborn must\u00a0continue following the path and quest marker until reaching a door and exit back out to\u00a0Nchuand-Zel.\nAfter exiting, straight ahead will be Krag's dead body and his journal at a makeshift campsite. At the campsite\u00a0there are many bloodstains on the floor and the bodies of two dead guards who were overseeing the expedition, indicating an ambush and slaughter by\u00a0(most likely) Falmer. To the left, on a bench, is the &lt;a href=\"Alteration%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Alteration&lt;/a&gt; skill book, \"&lt;a href=\"Sithis%20%28Book%29\"&gt;Sithis (Book)&lt;/a&gt;\". After reading\u00a0Krag's journal, the path to the left will lead up to\u00a0the door to Nchuand-Zel Control. After following this\u00a0path,\u00a0the Dragonborn will\u00a0eventually find Staubin's dead body and journal.\nThe Dragonborn is now tasked with re-activating Nchuand-Zel's automated defenses, which\u00a0is done by activating the lever at the end of the path, by Staubin's corpse\u00a0(activating this will start a\u00a0battle between any &lt;a href=\"Falmer%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Falmer&lt;/a&gt; in the ruin and the re-activated &lt;a href=\"Dwemer\"&gt;Dwemer&lt;/a&gt;\u00a0defenses). After re-activating the defenses and exiting the control room,\u00a0the Dragonborn should exit the ruin\u00a0and head back to &lt;a href=\"Understone%20Keep%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Understone Keep&lt;/a&gt;.\nStrangely, at this point, the quest marker will lead\u00a0the &lt;a href=\"Last%20Dragonborn\"&gt;Dragonborn&lt;/a&gt; around the dungeon again. This can be bypassed by ignoring the quest marker and heading out of the ruins. When the Dragonborn enters the great hall, they will be at the bottom level.\u00a0&lt;a href=\"Falmer%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Falmer&lt;/a&gt; will begin fighting with the defenses around the great hall. To get out of Nchuand-Zel, the Dragonborn should swim across the cavern and take the pathway back upwards.\nTo complete the quest, the Dragonborn must speak to Calcelmo in Markarth Keep. Calcelmo will talk about warning the expeditioners against going, and then he will give the Dragonborn the sum of money he would have\u00a0given to the expeditioners (if they had survived).\u00a0\nRewards.\nA\u00a0large number of Dwarven metal pieces can be found throughout the ruin and smelted to\u00a0obtain &lt;a href=\"Dwarven%20Metal%20Ingot\"&gt;Dwarven Metal Ingot&lt;/a&gt;s. Leveled loot can be found in the chest next to Erj's\u00a0corpse in the Nchuand-Zel Armory. Lastly,\u00a0Calcelmo will give a leveled amount of gold for completing this quest."}

The name of that king and two of the lords are lost to history. &lt;a href=\"Lord%20Faleria\"&gt;Lord Faleria's&lt;/a&gt; name, however, is whispered in the night as a cautionary tale of how far one would go to protect those they love.\nAs a young man, Lord Faleria secretly, and to shame of his family, fell in love with an &lt;a href=\"Mer\"&gt;Elven&lt;/a&gt; scholar, wise in the ways of dark magic and &lt;a href=\"necromancy\"&gt;necromancy&lt;/a&gt;. The &lt;a href=\"Nenalata\"&gt;Nenalata&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Ayleid\"&gt;Ayleid&lt;/a&gt;s swore fealty to the &lt;a href=\"First%20Empire\"&gt;Empire&lt;/a&gt;, but their people were still an unwelcome sight in polite society. Together, they pored over lost secrets, hoping to find a way to be together always. They married in secret and enjoyed a few short years of happiness, which ended with an Imperial decree.\nTo hide his wife from the purge, Lord Faleria expanded &lt;a href=\"Fort%20Faleria\"&gt;his fortress&lt;/a&gt; into the underground tunnels beneath the structure. They enlarged the space with magic, the sweat of hired workers, and the help of a tribe of &lt;a href=\"Minotaur%20%28Online%29\"&gt;minotaurs&lt;/a&gt;. It was to be grand underground complex to match those of his wife's Ayleid ancestors, and equally as brutal.\nAs each wing was completed, they secretly had the workers put to death. Some were buried. Some had the life drawn out of them to extend the lives of Lord Faleria and his wife. Of these, some were raised as undead guardians. After all, Lord Farelia could not allow rumors and secrets to get out, and dead guardians spread no tales.\nAs the complex grew, so did Lord Faleria's family. He swore to do anything to protect his children\u2014these Elven children\u2014from death or banishment at the hands of the Empire. It was during the birth of &lt;a href=\"Ianus%20Faleria\"&gt;their third child&lt;/a&gt; that &lt;a href=\"Lady%20Faleria\"&gt;Lady Faleria&lt;/a&gt; died. In mourning, his lordship erected a great brass tomb in the tunnels, sealing his love away and promising to do anything to protect her children from the religious zealots of the Empire.\nAt this time, Lord Faleria delved deeper into the study of dark arts, formulating wicked magic fueled bu a darkness from some far realm that consumed all things good and light. He learned to channel the power and found it all but limitless.\nLord Faleria edged closer and closer to madness after the death of his Elven wife, though he could never explain his troubles to his peers in the outside world. To keep his Elven family a secret, he continued to use disposable labor to expand their realm and give them new comforts.\nThe children grew into adults, rarely seeing sunlight. Well into adulthood, his youngest son could not take his confinement any longer. He managed to escape, and did so easily and often. Inevitably, as there things happen, the son fell in love with a merchant's daughter. Soon, she was with child. The girl's family, horrified at &lt;a href=\"Maxivian%20Faleria\"&gt;the child&lt;/a&gt;'s Elven traits, forced the young woman to confess that her lover was Lord Faleria's son. Horrified at being discovered, Lord Faleria took his grandson and hid him with the rest of the family.\nThe Empire was at his gate within days, with charges ranging from treason to giving aid to the enemy. For these crimes against the Empire, he had no defense. But he had prepared a response for this day. In his madness, Lord Faleria performed a dark ritual. If he could not be with his family, he would rather destroy everything he created\u2014and the Imperial Army along with it.\nThe night came. The ritual concluded. It would take only one final gesture to consume the entire castle in eternal darkness. At the final moment, a hand fell upon his shoulder. His son was behind him, standing with the rest of the family.\nIt was too late. The very shadows crawled like smoke from he ground, dissolving objects, walls, &lt;a href=\"men\"&gt;men&lt;/a&gt;, and mer. Some formed man-like shapes and attacked the besieging army from within. Others opened up like rifts, and the world fell inside them.\nWhen it was over, only Lord Faleria remained amid the &lt;a href=\"Tribune%27s%20Folly\"&gt;freshly made ruins&lt;/a&gt;. As the legends say, he buried his children and grandchild on the surface, where he never allowed them to go. Then he retreated into the hole in the ground, sealing it behind him.\nFor most great men, the walls and monuments survive far longer than their name. For Lord Faleria, the location of his fort is lost to time, but his name remains."}

The Outlander Incarnate is a 'blessed guest', one not born of the tribes but accepted as a guest with rights of hearth and hospitality. Under Red Mountain he will confront and balance against seven curses. See the '&lt;a href=\"The%20Seven%20Curses\"&gt;Seven Curses&lt;/a&gt;' prophecy; also, &lt;a href=\"Dagoth%20Ur%20%28Character%29\"&gt;Dagoth Ur&lt;/a&gt; is served by his seven kin, once great wizard-lords, called '&lt;a href=\"Ash%20Vampire\"&gt;ash vampires&lt;/a&gt;' by the Ashlanders.\nLine 6-7: 'Star-blessed' suggests &lt;a href=\"Azura\"&gt;Azura&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"Daedric%20Princes\"&gt;Daedra Lord&lt;/a&gt; and patron of magic, fate, and prophecy.

The 'unmourned house' could be either or both of the lost &lt;a href=\"Great%20Houses\"&gt;Great Houses&lt;/a&gt; of the &lt;a href=\"Dunmer%20%28Morrowind%29\"&gt;Dunmer&lt;/a&gt; -- House &lt;a href=\"Dwemer\"&gt;Dwemer&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"House%20Dagoth\"&gt;House Dagoth&lt;/a&gt;."}

Julien has had training, but he is more interested in chasing girls than he is in pursuing honor. Rissiel will be walking around town; he should not be too hard to find.\nWhen talked to, he will tell the Vestige that he cannot leave town as he is close to winning the heart of a girl called &lt;a href=\"Guendeline%20Ascenge\"&gt;Guendeline Ascenge&lt;/a&gt;. He fears that if he leaves town and becomes a soldier, she will have married someone else by the time he comes back; however, he will agree to enlist if the Vestige can get her to agree to marry him first. To get a clue on how to do that, the Vestige must speak to Guendeline herself; she will be located in the Ascenge House in the south of town. She will tell the Vestige that Julien is rather boring in her eyes; she wants someone more romantic. At this point, the Vestige should ask around town to find out the things she likes. They will learn from this that she likes poetry and fancy jewelry, but she does not like flowers. Take this information to Julien to help him decide how to proceed.\nIf the necklace is chosen, the Vestige will have to collect gems in ruins to the north. When gems are taken to &lt;a href=\"Khalisah\"&gt;Khalisah&lt;/a&gt; to make the necklace, she will think that the necklace is a gift for her. If she is told otherwise, she will become sad but will make the necklace nevertheless. If she receives a more positive response, &lt;a href=\"Julien%20Rissiel\"&gt;Julien Rissiel&lt;/a&gt; can be persuaded to choose Khalisah instead of Guendeline.\nIf the poem is chosen, the Vestige will have to ask people around the town for poems. After asking several, Julien will have three options: to recite an orcish poem, to read a book of poetry, or to compose a poem himself. The recited poem from the book of poetry will happen to be Guendeline's favorite. If the Vestige tells him to recite the Orcish poem, though, she will hate it, telling Julien to go away and stop trying to woo her. If you tell him to compose a poem himself, he will say \"Guendeline, as you come down those stairs I wonder, if you've brushed your hair?\" She will become offended, ordering Julien to go away and never come back.\nIf flowers are chosen, \nRegardless of whether the Vestige has succeeded in helping Julien woo Guendeline, he will now agree to join the guard. Speak with Captain Thayer to finish the quest and get your reward."}

He describes them as growing more demented by the moment. After agreeing to deal with the situation, Haduras directs the Vestige to find his friend &lt;a href=\"Moon-Priest%20Zargha\"&gt;Moon-Priest Zargha&lt;/a&gt; before he is eaten by a beast whose young he had been chasing. Moon-Priest Zargha can be found in a cave not far off from Haduras. Zargha is being cornered by a &lt;a href=\"Terror%20Bird%20Matriarch\"&gt;Terror Bird Matriarch&lt;/a&gt; that must be slain.\nOnce the Matriarch has been defeated, Moon-Priest Zargha will proceed to flee the cave. After trying to follow him, the Vestige will be met by the &lt;a href=\"Skooma%20Cat\"&gt;Skooma Cat&lt;/a&gt; by the cave entrance and learn that it is the Cat that is responsible for the madness. After speaking with the Cat, the Vestige must return to the Temple. There, Haduras can be found speaking to two demented priests and informs the Vestige that some of the priests have been using a smelly fork to blind themselves at the instruction of the Moon-Bishop. He urges the Vestige to find the smelly fork while he keeps an eye on the priests.\nThe fork, revealed to be the &lt;a href=\"Fork%20of%20Horripilation%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Fork of Horripulation&lt;/a&gt;, an artifact of the &lt;a href=\"Daedric%20prince\"&gt;Daedric prince&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Sheogorath%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Sheogorath&lt;/a&gt;, is located by a camp guarded by several enemies. Once the Vestige has the Fork, they must return to Priest Haduras. Upon seeing it, Haduras deduces that it is related to the Skooma Cat, who is most likely behind the Moon-Bishop's strange visions. Haduras is surprised to learn that the Vestige has seen the Skooma Cat, or \"Sheggorath,\" as Haduras calls him.\nRealizing the Skooma Cat has somehow crossed the \"Lunar Lattice,\" he urges the Vestige to check on the Temple and stop the Moon-Bishop from spreading anymore madness, saying that he will join them once he has led the priests to safety. The Skooma Cat is located across from Haduras and refuses to explain his motives or stop his corrupting of the Temple. Instead, he urges the Vestige to check on the Moon-Bishop, who is about to do something dangerously reckless.\nAt the Temple, the player will find &lt;a href=\"Moon-Priest%20Rilasu\"&gt;Moon-Priest Rilasu&lt;/a&gt; speaking of salvation. She claims &lt;a href=\"Moon-Bishop%20Sizenza\"&gt;Moon-Bishop Sizenza&lt;/a&gt; said that they must ascend with &lt;a href=\"Khenarthi\"&gt;Khenarthi&lt;/a&gt; to escape the &lt;a href=\"Dragons%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Dragons&lt;/a&gt; and that their prophet is about to show them the path which leads to the &lt;a href=\"Sands%20Behind%20the%20Stars\"&gt;Sands Behind the Stars&lt;/a&gt;. She encourages the Vestige to join them.\nThe Vestige must enter the Temple and reach Moon-Bishop Sizenza who is standing on the ledge of a balcony, presumably to jump, as the Skooma Cat implied. Moon-Bishop Sizenza explains that she believed in her visions and was only trying to help her followers but is no longer certain. After being convinced to come down from the ledge, Moon-Bishop Sizenza suddenly disappears in an explosion of butterflies. The Skooma Cat appears in her place, annoyed that the Vestige was interfering with his \"favorite plaything.\" He refuses to leave the priests alone unless the Vestige agrees to become his new plaything in their stead. When the Vestige agrees, the Skooma Cat teleports the player to his &lt;a href=\"Skooma%20Cat%27s%20Cloister\"&gt;Cloister&lt;/a&gt;.\nWithin the Cloister, the Vestige discovers Moon-Bishop Sizenza under the influence of the Skooma Cat. The Vestige must try to distract the Skooma Cat long enough to rescue her by using items that can be found in the room. The only item that will work is milk-toast cream. When the Vestige presents the cream to the Skooma Cat, he will urge them to place it in a bowl. Doing so prompts the Skooma Cat eagerly eat the cream, allowing the Vestige to talk Sizenza out of her madness. However, this proves futile, as the Skooma Cat discovers the ploy in time to teleport himself and Sizenza away from the Vestige. Deeper within the Cloister, the Vestige will find Sizenza under the illusion of speaking to her fellow Moon-Priests about her visions. The Vestige must distract the Skooma Cat again.\nThis time the Vestige can use \"delightfully long yarn\" to distract the Skooma Cat, who is initially resistant but soon caves under the temptation. After he is sent chasing after the yarn, the Vestige can try to speak to Sizenza again. As with the previous attempt, the Skooma Cat will teleport himself and Sizenza away, forcing the player to track them down. Further inside the cloister and near an anchor, the Skooma Cat reveals himself in his humanoid form of Sheogorath. He claims to want to keep both the Vestige and Sizenza as playthings, despite promising to free one in exchange for the other. He also claims that the Vestige is not very fair by always winning, but the Vestige may argue that Sheogorath is always cheating.\nSheogorath offers the Vestige one last challenge: say his name backwards three times. Any of the three possible answers will lead the Vestige to pass the test. Sheogorath is annoyed but lets the Vestige and Sizenza claim their prize regardless. Once the Vestige has destroyed the anchor, Sheogorath summons a portal to let the player and Sizenza leave. Sizenza will arrive back at the Temple and express shame over her actions. Haduras will be present to reassure her that Sizenza was not herself and it was all the Skooma Cat's fault. Sizenza informs the Vestige that her ultimate fate is up to her clowder while she will beg for forgiveness for her failings, concluding the quest."}

But the Theory of the Lunar Lorkhan is of special note.\nIn short, the Moons were and are the two halves of Lorkhan's 'flesh-divinity'. Like the rest of the Gods, Lorkhan was a plane(t) that participated in the Great Construction... except where the &lt;a href=\"Eight%20Divines\"&gt;Eight&lt;/a&gt; lent portions of their heavenly bodies to create the mortal plane(t), Lorkhan's was cracked asunder and his divine spark fell to Nirn as a shooting star \"to impregnate it with the measure of its existence and a reasonable amount of selfishness.\"\n&lt;a href=\"Masser\"&gt;Masser&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Secunda\"&gt;Secunda&lt;/a&gt; therefore are the personifications of the dichotomy\u2014the \"Cloven Duality,\" according to &lt;a href=\"Psijic%20Order\"&gt;Artaeum&lt;/a&gt;\u2014that Lorkhan legends often rail against: ideas of the anima/animus, good/evil, being/nothingness, the poetry of the body, throat, and moan/silence-as-the- abortive, and so on\u2014set in the night sky as Lorkhan's constant reminder to his mortal issue of their duty.\nFollowers of this theory hold that all other \"Heart Stories\" are mythical of the true origin of the moons (and it needn't be said that they observe the \"hollow crescent theory\" as well)."}
