Once in the Harborage, find and speak to the Prophet. His response will be mostly cryptic, but will eventually say that he has located Lyris in Coldharbour. She was placed there after taking his place in &lt;a href=\"The%20Wailing%20Prison\"&gt;The Wailing Prison&lt;/a&gt; while attempting to save him, and was later moved to &lt;a href=\"The%20Foundry%20of%20Woe\"&gt;The Foundry of Woe&lt;/a&gt; to work for &lt;a href=\"Molag%20Bal%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Molag Bal&lt;/a&gt;. He will then open a gate for the Vestige to enter.\nEnter the gateway to &lt;a href=\"Oblivion%20%28Realm%29\"&gt;Oblivion&lt;/a&gt; and follow the marker to find Lyris, who will be standing by a large table. Once spoken to, she will say that she wishes to leave Coldharbour, but explains that she is unable to, due to everything being taken away from her and destroyed into fragments. All of the fragments have been locked away in different parts of the Foundry. The Vestige will need to retrieve all of these fragments in order to save Lyris.\nSettle Lyris's regret.\nAdvance into the Foundry to help Lyris with her regret. She has deep regrets about leaving home and never resolving issues with her father. After approaching the graves of her parents, the ghost of Lyris's father, &lt;a href=\"Gjalder\"&gt;Gjalder&lt;/a&gt;, will appear. He will tell the Vestige how his spirit was brought to Coldharbour, and how the &lt;a href=\"Daedra%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Daedra&lt;/a&gt; forced him to experience his murder repeatedly. Gjadler will explain that the Daedra are using him to prevent Lyris from leaving Coldharbour, who blames herself for his death.\nAssuage Lyris's solitude.\nContinue further in to help Lyris with her solitude. Coldharbour has constructed a mockery of an event in her life, where &lt;a href=\"Imperial%20Legion%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Imperial&lt;/a&gt; troops would mock her and steal her armor. The Vestige will will come upon an Imperial camp. Inside the camp are crates which contain Lyris's armor. The Vestige will need to return the armor back to Lyris.\nResolve Lyris's uncertainty.\nAfter advancing further into the Foundry and into Clannfear Roost, the projection of &lt;a href=\"Abnur%20Tharn%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Abnur Tharn&lt;/a&gt; will appear and tell Lyris that he is trying to help her. Behind him is Lyris' Axe on a small mound. Once approached, Abnur will materialize into a &lt;a href=\"Clannfear%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Clannfear&lt;/a&gt;. Once Lyris has received her axe, she will then use it to destroy the stone wall blocking the passage.\nPrison of Echoes.\nAdvance further into the Foundry, which will contain multiple &lt;a href=\"Ogrim%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Ogrim&lt;/a&gt;. Enter the Prison of Echoes and investigate the chamber. Within the middle of the room will be a projection of &lt;a href=\"Sai%20Sahan%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Sai Sahan&lt;/a&gt;, who will say that he is being tortured for the location of the &lt;a href=\"Amulet%20of%20Kings%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Amulet of Kings&lt;/a&gt;. He will then disappear, to which Lyris will tell the Vestige that they should speak to the Prophet for advice on how to help Sai escape.\nVanquish Lyris's terror.\nAfter entering the Crucible of Terror, Lyris will begin to experience feelings of loneliness and fear. Her &lt;a href=\"Manifestation%20of%20Terror%20%28Creature%29\"&gt;Manifestation of Terror&lt;/a&gt;, a &lt;a href=\"Watcher\"&gt;Watcher&lt;/a&gt;, will appear. The Vestige will need defeat the Watcher in order for Lyris to reclaim her memories and escape Coldharbour.\nThe Harborage.\nOnce the Vestige is back in the Harborage, they will need to speak to the Prophet for advice. One can choose to tell him about Sai Sahan and Abnur Tharn, to which he will say that Sai Sahan needs to be set free before &lt;a href=\"Mannimarco%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Mannimarco&lt;/a&gt;, his torturer, forces him to reveal The Amulet of King's location, and that it is strange for Abnur Tharn to go against Mannimarco by helping Lyris. The Prophet will then reward the Vestige, completing the quest."}

She has a fascination with the lives of adventurers like them. It's unfortunate as her duty as the chief-daughter she must be wed to another clan, to forge an alliance. She thinks Lokra is seeking to escape this honor, and she the Vestige can help. Lorka will listen, as if she leaves without the blessing from the clan, she will be clanless.\nAfter accepting to help, head down to the docks where Lorka stands all day, staring at the ship the Vestige arrived on. When talking to her she would like to know if they arrived with &lt;a href=\"Lambur\"&gt;Lambur&lt;/a&gt; on that ship. She is envious, free to see the world and make ones life whatever one wants.\nShe knows her duties to the clan but she wants to see the world before she gets married. She mentions she has no courage, and that she wants to go but not without the blessing of her mother and grandmother. The Vestige suggests they can talk to them but Lorka thinks it's no use.\nFollow the markers to find the mother and grandmother. &lt;a href=\"Glurala%20the%20Wise\"&gt;Glurala&lt;/a&gt;, the grandmother, senses Lokra has found an ally in them. She can't determine Lorka's path, nor can her mother or the chief. She must decide, and if she leaves without any blessing, she must accept the cost. Tell her to follow her heart.\nThe mother is found in the chief's chambers, she says her daughter has spirit, I'll give her that. She knows her duty and she would rather have her be miserable and alive than dead on some fool adventure. Lokra must accept her part and perform her duty, remind her of that.\nHead back to Lokra at the docks and tell her what the mother and grandmother said. The Vestige can now choose between advising her to stay and do her duty, or tell her her life is her own, suggesting she comes sailing with them, if that's what she wants. Completing the quest will give a reward of the &lt;a href=\"Seamount%20Bow\"&gt;Seamount Bow&lt;/a&gt; and some ."}

The Covenant warships destroyed the residential district to the north, and they would raid trading ships coming into the Stonefalls coastline. &lt;a href=\"Holgunn%20One-Eye\"&gt;Holgunn One-Eye&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Tanval%20Indoril\"&gt;Tanval Indoril&lt;/a&gt; lead the defense in Davon's Watch, but the Covenant Armada was too powerful to handle. Tanval resurrected &lt;a href=\"Balreth\"&gt;Balreth&lt;/a&gt; of the Brothers of Strife to destroy the armada. After obliterating the armada, Balreth rampaged across the Stonefalls countryside until he was put to rest atop the Ash Mountain.\n&lt;a href=\"Third%20Era\"&gt;Third Era&lt;/a&gt;.\nDuring the &lt;a href=\"Imperial%20Simulacrum\"&gt;Imperial Simulacrum&lt;/a&gt;, the Darnim Watch township existed in Morrowind under the leadership of &lt;a href=\"House%20Indoril\"&gt;House Indoril&lt;/a&gt; in between the towns of &lt;a href=\"Eagle%20Moor\"&gt;Eagle Moor&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Dragon%20Glade\"&gt;Dragon Glade&lt;/a&gt;. At one point, the &lt;a href=\"Eternal%20Champion\"&gt;Eternal Champion&lt;/a&gt; had visited the town on their quest for a piece of the &lt;a href=\"Staff%20of%20Chaos\"&gt;Staff of Chaos&lt;/a&gt; to defeat &lt;a href=\"Jagar%20Tharn\"&gt;Jagar Tharn&lt;/a&gt; at the &lt;a href=\"Imperial%20Palace\"&gt;Imperial Palace&lt;/a&gt;."}

The events that occurred during this &lt;a href=\"era\"&gt;era&lt;/a&gt; are known only through myth and religious teachings, and interpretations vary from culture to culture. During the Dawn Era, &lt;a href=\"time\"&gt;time&lt;/a&gt; did not originally exist, and even when it was created it followed an incomprehensible nonlinear path, such as what is seen in a &lt;a href=\"Dragon%20Break\"&gt;Dragon Break&lt;/a&gt;. Most scholars, however, agree to a single common series of events that led up to the start of recorded history.\nLorkhan's plan.\nAnu and Padomay's constant struggle had created a number of planes for the et'Ada to inhabit, but not all of them were content. One, called &lt;a href=\"Lorkhan\"&gt;Lorkhan&lt;/a&gt;, who was created by Sithis, approached the others with a plan to create their own plane. He proposed the creation of what would become the mortal plane, &lt;a href=\"Mundus\"&gt;Mundus&lt;/a&gt;, and its population with beings of the et'Ada's creation.\nLorkhan managed to convince a number of his peers to aid him in his plan, including Auri-El. These divines are collectively referred to as the &lt;a href=\"Aedra\"&gt;Aedra&lt;/a&gt;, while the rest of the et'Ada are &lt;a href=\"Daedra\"&gt;Daedra&lt;/a&gt; (these terms have no meaning during the Dawn Era, as they are explicitly relative to the &lt;a href=\"Mer\"&gt;Mer&lt;/a&gt; and their ancestral beliefs). These Aedra began to form the mortal plane, but soon realized that they had been tricked. Although Anu and Padomay were infinite, the et'Ada were not. They realized that they were giving up parts of themselves to form this new world, something Lorkhan (according to Mer tradition) was fully aware of.\nDuring this process, Lorkhan's heart was removed, and made into a magical stone.\nDeparture of the gods.\nMany of the gods departed the mortal plane before it was complete. Chief among these was &lt;a href=\"Magnus\"&gt;Magnus&lt;/a&gt;, the architect of Lorkhan's plan, who fled Mundus to return to Aetherius. His departure opened a hole in the barrier between planes, allowing magic to flood into Mundus. Not all of the gods chose to leave, however. Some, the &lt;a href=\"Eight%20Divines\"&gt;Eight Divines&lt;/a&gt;, bound themselves to the new plane, but returned to their own planes in the end. These became the gods of many of the new inhabitants of the world, and were seen from Nirn as planets in the night sky.\nOne group of these beings fully surrendered their divinity, and formed the Ehlnofey. This now mortal race began to procreate in the physical sense, and eventually diverged into the mortal races of the &lt;a href=\"Mythic%20Era\"&gt;Mythic Era&lt;/a&gt;. The remaining divines, before leaving Nirn to the mortals, created the &lt;a href=\"Adamantine%20Tower\"&gt;Adamantine Tower&lt;/a&gt;, and convened there to decide Lorkhan's fate.\nAt the end of the Dawn Era, Lorkhan was permanently bound to his creation when his heart was ripped from his body and cast down to Tamriel. There it would form Vvardenfell, the Red Mountain volcano, and remain dormant for thousands of years. The remaining gods then left Nirn, allowing time to stabilize and flow linearly. This marked the start of recorded elven history, and the beginning of the\u00a0&lt;a href=\"Merethic%20Era\"&gt;Merethic Era&lt;/a&gt;.\nOther events.\nIt has been claimed that during the Dawn Era, the &lt;a href=\"Orsimer\"&gt;Orsimer&lt;/a&gt; were created."}

Or, at least, I soon shall be.\nThanks to the secrets I have unveiled within these ancient &lt;a href=\"Nede%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Nedic&lt;/a&gt; ruins, I have replicated the process by which the Nedes were able to imbue &lt;a href=\"mortal\"&gt;mortal&lt;/a&gt; creatures with celestial energy. Using techniques perfected by the &lt;a href=\"alchemists\"&gt;alchemists&lt;/a&gt; of the &lt;a href=\"Scaled%20Court\"&gt;Scaled Court&lt;/a&gt; and the runescribers of the Iron Orcs that were tested upon the &lt;a href=\"Mantikora%20%28Online%29\"&gt;mantikoras&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Troll%20%28Online%29\"&gt;trolls&lt;/a&gt;, I have developed the means to transform my mortal frame into a conduit for &lt;a href=\"Aetherial\"&gt;Aetherial&lt;/a&gt; power.\nOf course, none of this would have been possible if not for the discovery\u2014or re-discovery\u2014of the primal element called red brittle by the locals and &lt;a href=\"nirncrux\"&gt;nirncrux&lt;/a&gt; by my alchemists. The crimson substance can be extremely dangerous in its natural state. But thanks to the refinement processes we were able to reproduce from the ancient texts, the stable version of the element provided the key to making the transformation possible.\nNow we stand upon the shores of a new world. Once the process is complete and I emerge from the spawning pool as the Exalted Viper, I shall be an equal to the Celestial &lt;a href=\"The%20Serpent%20%28Celestial%29\"&gt;Serpent&lt;/a&gt;. I shall be like a &lt;a href=\"god\"&gt;god&lt;/a&gt;! But not a fickle or absent deity. Oh, no.

You will find Titus outside the &lt;a href=\"Star-Gazers%27%20Observatory\"&gt;Star-Gazers' Observatory&lt;/a&gt;. He will tell you that &lt;a href=\"Kelmen%20Locke\"&gt;Kelmen Locke&lt;/a&gt; has gone to investigate a disturbance at the ruins of &lt;a href=\"Skyreach%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Skyreach&lt;/a&gt;, and has not been heard from since. &lt;a href=\"The%20Thief%20%28Celestial%29\"&gt;the Thief&lt;/a&gt; also wishes to find the source of the disturbance, and is performing a ritual in &lt;a href=\"The%20Howling%20Sepulchers\"&gt;The Howling Sepulchers&lt;/a&gt; up north. For this, she needs three people though, so with Kelmen gone, that task falls to you and Titus. \nThe Howling Sephulcers are all the way in the northeast of Craglorn, east of the &lt;a href=\"Valley%20of%20Scars\"&gt;Valley of Scars&lt;/a&gt;. Once you are inside, head around the corner to the left. Follow the river until you reach the entrance to the Sanctum of Farsight. Once youenter, the Thief will tell you to light the fires on the pedestals around her, but you must be quick for the fires will not remain lit for long. Speed around the room and light all the fires, and you will see a vision of Kelmen Locke and &lt;a href=\"Regent%20Cassipia\"&gt;Regent Cassipia&lt;/a&gt;. Cassipia is trying to set herself up as a new Celestial called the Exalted Viper, and is willing to destroy Belkarth in the process. At the end of the vision, she will kill Kelmen. \nSpeak to the Thief about all this and she will tell you that Cassipia is currently in the &lt;a href=\"Loth%27Na%20Caverns%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Loth'Na Caverns&lt;/a&gt;, which lie west of the Valley of Scars. When you tell her that you have worked with Cassipia and that Cassipia collected &lt;a href=\"Nirncrux\"&gt;Nirncrux&lt;/a&gt; as well as something from the &lt;a href=\"Mantikora%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Mantikoras&lt;/a&gt;, the Thief will speculate that Cassipia has regained knowledge that she hoped was lost with the Nedes. \nHead to the Loth'Na Caverns. Once you are inside, the Thief will tell you to meet her at the top of the rise, which is all the way on the other side of the dungeon, behind the boss &lt;a href=\"Visskar\"&gt;Visskar&lt;/a&gt;. Once there, the Thief will tell you to activate the triggers that will summon the bridge to the other side. There are four triggers here, but this is not a puzzle; just activate all of them and head over to the other side. There, you will find the entrance to Skyreach Temple. Head in and up the stairs, and you will find &lt;a href=\"Little%20Leaf\"&gt;Little Leaf&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"The%20Exalted%20Viper\"&gt;The Exalted Viper&lt;/a&gt; there. Little Leaf and a few of the Scaled Court will engage you in battle; once you have killed Little Leaf, the Exalted Viper herself will enter the battlefield and summon the ghost of Little Leaf. Slay them both to stop this madness, and the Thief will open a portal back to the Star-Gazers' Observatory.\nBack in the observatory, talk to the Thief to finish the quest. As a reward, you will get a coffer containing one of the rare &lt;a href=\"Nirnhoned\"&gt;Nirnhoned&lt;/a&gt; items."}

If the target is killed within that time, it may explode. Over the course of ten seconds, the chance to trigger an explosion is codice_1, where x is the number of strikes. In other words, the more times the target is hit, the more likely the explosion is to happen. The explosion only happens if the target is undead. It is not actually necessary for the killing blow that triggers the explosion to be dealt with Dawnbreaker. A second enchantment deals 10 to 15 points of &lt;a href=\"Fire%20Damage%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;fire damage&lt;/a&gt; with each hit. The fire damage depends on the &lt;a href=\"Augmented%20Flames%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Augmented Flames&lt;/a&gt; perk, dealing 12 points of damage for the first rank and 15 points for the second. &lt;a href=\"Ahzidal%20%28Mask%29\"&gt;Ahzidal's Mask&lt;/a&gt; can further increase the fire damage to 17.\nThis blast will damage any nearby undead, including &lt;a href=\"Turn%20Undead%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;turning&lt;/a&gt; undead followers such as &lt;a href=\"Serana\"&gt;Serana&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"dead%20thrall\"&gt;dead thrall&lt;/a&gt;s, depending on level, and can cause any survivors to flee for a short period of time. Undead killed in the blast will crumble into ash piles. The fiery explosion has the same visual effect and functions as the &lt;a href=\"Bane%20of%20the%20Undead\"&gt;Bane of the Undead&lt;/a&gt; spell, and thus benefits from &lt;a href=\"Necromage%20%28Perk%29\"&gt;Necromage&lt;/a&gt;. If one is a vampire and is quick enough when the blast goes into effect, they can see this unique version of Bane of the Undead, is in fact named \"Meridia's light.\" Note that this can affect &lt;a href=\"Serana\"&gt;Serana&lt;/a&gt; as she is a &lt;a href=\"Vampire%20Lord\"&gt;Vampire Lord&lt;/a&gt;. If the player is a Vampire or Vampire Lord, the explosion will damage and can kill the player if one is on low health, the same way it affects other undead.\nIn addition, this weapon has a very high number of charges; much higher than most enchanted weapons. Since soul gems restore a fixed number of charges, this weapon will require more than a single &lt;a href=\"Grand%20Soul%20Gem%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;grand soul&lt;/a&gt; to recharge it fully.\nSmithing.\nThe Dawnbreaker can be upgraded with an &lt;a href=\"Ebony%20Ingot%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;ebony ingot&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Arcane%20Blacksmith\"&gt;Arcane Blacksmith&lt;/a&gt; perk, however, it does not benefit from any &lt;a href=\"Smithing%20%28Skyrim%29%23Perks\"&gt;Smithing perks&lt;/a&gt;. This means that the weapon cannot be improved past flawless quality without boosting the &lt;a href=\"Smithing%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Smithing&lt;/a&gt; skill over 100. This can be achieved by using &lt;a href=\"Fortify%20Smithing%23Enchanting\"&gt;enchanted apparel&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"Fortify%20Smithing%23Potions\"&gt;blacksmithing potions&lt;/a&gt; to &lt;a href=\"fortify%20Smithing\"&gt;fortify Smithing&lt;/a&gt;.\nUsefulness.\nWhile other swords possess higher damage, the special enchantment Dawnbreaker is imbued with makes it very useful for dealing with &lt;a href=\"Draugr%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;draugr&lt;/a&gt;, especially when confronted by a group of undead in a small space. High-level enemies, such as a &lt;a href=\"Draugr%20Deathlord%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Draugr Deathlord&lt;/a&gt;, almost always attack alongside several lower leveled ones that can be killed in a few hits. The resulting explosion instantly kills low-level undead and causes the high-level draugr to flee. Furthermore, investing perks into the One-Handed skill would increase the base damage which the weapon inflicts.\nIt is also an effective weapon against &lt;a href=\"Vampire%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;vampires&lt;/a&gt;. In addition to being very vulnerable to fire, they are also undead, therefore they are affected by the fiery explosion. However, if the &lt;a href=\"Last%20Dragonborn\"&gt;Dragonborn&lt;/a&gt; is a vampire, the resulting explosion will affect them as well. Members of the &lt;a href=\"Dawnguard%20%28Faction%29\"&gt;Dawnguard&lt;/a&gt; may want to obtain it, as it will be helpful while fighting vampires, and especially helpful during the siege of &lt;a href=\"Castle%20Volkihar\"&gt;Castle Volkihar&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe blast will also trigger by and affect the ash spawns in the Dragonborn DLC location of Solstheim, making it useful against them as well. However, they will resist the fire enchantment, diminishing the weapon's damage potential to that of the actual physical damage it deals.\nDuplication exploit.\nTwo copies of Dawnbreaker can be obtained. This is achieved by casting a spell or using a shout with significant kinetic force, such as using &lt;a href=\"Fire%20Storm%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Fire Storm&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Fireball%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Fireball&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Fire%20Rune%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Fire Rune&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Ice%20Storm%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Ice Storm&lt;/a&gt;, beside the sword altar after defeating &lt;a href=\"Malkoran\"&gt;Malkoran&lt;/a&gt; and his shades. This will cause a copy of Dawnbreaker to fly across the room, while the original still stays where it is. Find and pick up the copy before obtaining the original from the altar, because doing so ends the quest and transports the Dragonborn outside the dungeon. This appears to work on all versions, but is inconsistent and not guaranteed."}

Starting at dawn (6AM), the &lt;a href=\"Hero%20of%20Kvatch\"&gt;Hero&lt;/a&gt; wields \"Dawnfang\"; at nightfall (6PM), it changes into \"Duskfang\". It belongs to &lt;a href=\"Grommok%20gro-Barak\"&gt;Grommok gro-Barak&lt;/a&gt;, and is said to be one of the most powerful weapons in the game; extremely useful for low levels, but even more deadly at its peak of lvl 30+.\nBackground.\nIn his journal, Grommok mentions that, according to &lt;a href=\"Syndelius%20Gatharian\"&gt;Syndelius Gatharian&lt;/a&gt;, the sword is &lt;a href=\"Akavir\"&gt;Akavir&lt;/a&gt;i in origin, created by the &lt;a href=\"Tsaesci\"&gt;Tsaesci&lt;/a&gt;. How it was found in an Ayleid ruin remains a mystery.\nAcquisition.\nThis sword is awarded after completing the quest \"&lt;a href=\"Baiting%20the%20Trap\"&gt;Baiting the Trap&lt;/a&gt;\" as part of the &lt;a href=\"Main%20Quest%20%28Shivering%20Isles%29\"&gt;\"Shivering Isles\" main quest&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href=\"Kiliban%20Nyrandil\"&gt;Kiliban Nyrandil&lt;/a&gt; will find the sword on the &lt;a href=\"Orsimer%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;Orc&lt;/a&gt; Grommok; after teleporting to the room with the chest, talk to Kiliban to receive the rewards.\nProperties.\nNourish Blade.\nDawnfang/Duskfang keeps track of enemies killed, displaying the text \"Dawnfang/Duskfang has extinguished X lives.\" (X being the number of creatures or characters killed, much like &lt;a href=\"Mehrunes%27%20Razor%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;Mehrunes' Razor&lt;/a&gt;.) Once the quota of \"twelve lives extinguished\" has been met and the sword's bloodthirst is satisfied, the next incarnation will be \"Superior\", adding the effect of &lt;a href=\"Absorb%20Health%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;Absorb Health&lt;/a&gt; if it is \"Dawnfang Superior\", and &lt;a href=\"Absorb%20Magicka%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;Absorb Magicka&lt;/a&gt; if it is \"Duskfang Superior\". If it becomes, for example, \"Dawnfang Superior\", then the next time it becomes Dawnfang it will not stay superior. Failure to nourish the blade fully reverts it to the normal version with the next incarnation.\nBoth versions of the blade must have charge for the nourish ability to work. If the blade has depleted to a level where no effect is caused by the blade when used, then the nourish effect will not work. Simply recharging the blade with a soul gem or at a shop will fix this.\nAn easy way to quench Dawnfang/Duskfang's \"Bloodlust\" is to use a summoning spell. Attack the creature summoned and it will be counted as a life taken.\nBase weapon.\nEach weapon deals a small amount of fire (Dawnfang) or frost (Duskfang) damage.\nSuperior.\nThe weight, damage, health, value&lt;a href=\"%23Bugs\"&gt;*&lt;/a&gt;, fire/frost damage and Nourish Blade effect of superior versions are the same as the base weapon. The only change is more charges, and the added absorb health (Dawnfang) or magicka (Duskfang) effect."}

They are an ancient order of &lt;a href=\"vampire%20hunters\"&gt;vampire hunters&lt;/a&gt;, once retired but have recently been revived by &lt;a href=\"Isran\"&gt;Isran&lt;/a&gt;, a former &lt;a href=\"Vigilant%20of%20Stendarr\"&gt;Vigilant of Stendarr&lt;/a&gt;, now dedicated to eradicating &lt;a href=\"Vampire%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Vampires&lt;/a&gt;\u00a0throughout Skyrim. &lt;a href=\"Fort%20Dawnguard\"&gt;Fort Dawnguard&lt;/a&gt; serves as their headquarters and can only be accessed via &lt;a href=\"Dayspring%20Canyon\"&gt;Dayspring Canyon&lt;/a&gt; located in the snowy mists, east of &lt;a href=\"Riften%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Riften&lt;/a&gt;, near &lt;a href=\"Stendarr%27s%20Beacon\"&gt;Stendarr's Beacon&lt;/a&gt;.\nHistory.\nThe history of the Dawnguard is vague and is\u00a0surrounded by rumors and hearsay. What little is known, however, is that the group was formed in the &lt;a href=\"Second%20Era\"&gt;Second Era&lt;/a&gt; by the &lt;a href=\"Jarl\"&gt;Jarl&lt;/a&gt; of Riften\u00a0at that time. The Jarl's son, through his overly confident and adventurous pursuits, contracted &lt;a href=\"vampirism\"&gt;vampirism&lt;/a&gt;\u00a0one day. The Jarl refused to kill his own son, so instead he commissioned the construction of a fort and\u00a0hired a large mercenary force, later branded the \"Dawnguard,\" to keep his son quarantined.\nSome say the Dawnguard had to put the Jarl's son down and were banished from the hold.\u00a0The Dawnguard, however, continued their work as vampire hunters until they broke up, due to the fact people increasingly disregarded the threat of vampires, weakening the power and respect\u00a0of the Dawnguard.\nOthers claim that the Dawnguard, upon seeing the immense power of a vampire, decided to become vampires themselves. They were said to have preyed on the Rift until they were hunted down.\nEven more rumors say that the Dawnguard were disliked because of their abuse of power as they went on nightly raids and pillaged small villages without any probable cause.\nInteractions.\nRandom vampire encounters.\nHostile vampires begin to appear in cities at night at around level 7\u20138, and rumors of a group of vampire hunters called the Dawnguard can be heard at level 10, thus opening the Dawnguard questline. Alternately, Fort Dawnguard (and the questline) is accessible at level 1 right after the Dragonborn's escape from &lt;a href=\"Helgen\"&gt;Helgen&lt;/a&gt;. Visit &lt;a href=\"Dayspring%20Canyon\"&gt;Dayspring Canyon&lt;/a&gt;, the entrance to which is located just off the road, near the eastern edge of &lt;a href=\"Skyrim\"&gt;Skyrim&lt;/a&gt; and almost directly east of Riften, downhill to the north-northwest from &lt;a href=\"Stendarr%27s%20Beacon\"&gt;Stendarr's Beacon&lt;/a&gt;.\nGuild perks.\nThe unique benefits of joining the Dawnguard include full access to Fort Dawnguard, various &lt;a href=\"%23Weapons\"&gt;new weapons&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"%23Armor\"&gt;armor&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Magic%20%28Dawnguard%29\"&gt;spells&lt;/a&gt; to help fight vampires, such as crossbows, Dawnguard armor, and faction-specific spells such as &lt;a href=\"Sun%20Damage%20%28Dawnguard%29\"&gt;Sun Damage&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Vampire%27s%20Bane%20%28Dawnguard%29\"&gt;Vampire's Bane&lt;/a&gt;.\nFurthermore, Dawnguard members can also hire &lt;a href=\"Armored%20Troll\"&gt;Armored Troll&lt;/a&gt;s for 500 apiece, which serve as temporary &lt;a href=\"Followers%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;followers&lt;/a&gt;.\nIf caught as a &lt;a href=\"Vampire%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;vampire&lt;/a&gt; after joining the Dawnguard &lt;a href=\"Isran\"&gt;Isran&lt;/a&gt; will direct the player to &lt;a href=\"Falion%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Falion&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Morthal%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Morthal&lt;/a&gt; to cure the Vampirism.

They are hostile towards members of the &lt;a href=\"Volkihar%20Clan%20%28Dawnguard%29\"&gt;Volkihar Clan&lt;/a&gt;.\nEquipment.\nCrossbows are the trademark weapons of the Dawnguard.

The initial path leads straight to a glacial waterfall overlooking a lake. Near the lake is Agmaer, a young &lt;a href=\"Nords%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Nord&lt;/a&gt; recruit. He asks if he can accompany the Dragonborn to the fort and remarks on his nervous disposition and his high hopes of joining the Dawnguard.\nFort Dawnguard.\nUpon reaching the fort, the Dragonborn encounters Durak outside practicing with his crossbow. When asked about the weapon he will give them a &lt;a href=\"Crossbow%20%28Dawnguard%20weapon%29\"&gt;standard crossbow&lt;/a&gt; and some &lt;a href=\"Steel%20Bolt%20%28Dawnguard%29\"&gt;steel bolts&lt;/a&gt; to try out. Continuing into the fort, they will walk in on a heated discussion between &lt;a href=\"Isran\"&gt;Isran&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Vigilant%20Tolan\"&gt;Vigilant Tolan&lt;/a&gt;.\nIsran: \"Why are you here, Tolan? The Vigilants and I were finished long ago.\"\nTolan: \"You know why I'm here, the Vigilants are under attack everywhere. The vampires are much more dangerous than we believed.\"\nIsran: \"And now you want to come running to safety with the Dawnguard, is that it? I remember Keeper Carcette telling me repeatedly that Dawnguard is a crumbling ruin, not worth the expense and manpower to repair. And now that you've stirred up the vampires against you, you come begging for my protection?\"\nTolan: \"Isran, Carcette is dead. The Hall of Vigilants... everyone... they're all dead. You were right, we were wrong. Isn't that enough for you?\"\nIsran: \"Yes, well... I never wanted any of this to happen. I tried to warn all of you... I am sorry, you know.\"\nIt is revealed that the &lt;a href=\"Hall%20of%20the%20Vigilant\"&gt;Hall of the Vigilant&lt;/a&gt; was attacked and destroyed by vampires and everyone, including &lt;a href=\"Keeper%20Carcette\"&gt;Keeper Carcette&lt;/a&gt;, was killed. Isran is reluctant to help due to the friction between himself and the Vigilants. Tolan updates the Dragonborn on the vampires' mission: They are looking for something buried within &lt;a href=\"Dimhollow%20Crypt\"&gt;Dimhollow Crypt&lt;/a&gt;.

Dawnstar is a bustling trading town that produces all sorts of produce, ranging from fish to smithing materials. It is where the sun greets you as it begins its journey, hence the name.\nDescription.\nGeography.\nDawnstar is situated along the &lt;a href=\"Sea%20of%20Ghosts\"&gt;Sea of Ghosts&lt;/a&gt;, making it a prominent trading stop between the city-states of &lt;a href=\"Windhelm\"&gt;Windhelm&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Solitude\"&gt;Solitude&lt;/a&gt;, both located on the edge of Skyrim. Dawnstar's ports give ships coming from abroad to send their produce to the wilds of Central Skyrim. Dawnstar, on the mainland, is situated in a frozen sea of snow, with a stretch of road to the boreal forests of the southern Pale, though Dawnstar's geography caters to the harsh environment. Dawnstar city is built within an opening situated on the Sea of Ghosts, where the northern mountains begin and continue onto &lt;a href=\"Winterhold%20%28Region%29\"&gt;Winterhold&lt;/a&gt;. This pocket in the mountain range is where Dawnstar is situated, with a path to the coast. The people of the city have established several watchtowers along this area. South of the city, overlooking the entire domain is &lt;a href=\"Nightcaller%20Temple\"&gt;Nightcaller Temple&lt;/a&gt;, formerly called the Tower of Dawn. To the east, the Dawnstar Lighthouse guides passing ships to Dawnstar, though it is not anything to write home about. One of Dawnstar's trades is mining, and so the city host two mineshafts, both of which produce &lt;a href=\"Iron\"&gt;Iron&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Quicksilver\"&gt;Quicksilver&lt;/a&gt;, which are commonly used materials in weapons.\nDawnstar city is split into an upper and lower level. The Upper Level contains the main gate, leading into the Skyrim wilderness, eventually taking travelers to nearby townships such as &lt;a href=\"Bardmont\"&gt;Bardmont&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Dunstad%20Grove\"&gt;Dunstad Grove&lt;/a&gt;. Around the main gate are several points of interest. On certain occasions, the &lt;a href=\"Khajiit\"&gt;Khajiit&lt;/a&gt;i Caravan or other traveling merchants would settle outside the gate. Hidden behind some stone is a hidden entrance to the long-forgotten &lt;a href=\"Dawnstar%20Sanctuary\"&gt;Dawnstar Sanctuary&lt;/a&gt;, which was initially used by the &lt;a href=\"Dark%20Brotherhood\"&gt;Dark Brotherhood&lt;/a&gt; as their headquarters in the Pale. But upon entering the gate, you are greeted to the Dawnster Upper Level, which contains a view of the Dawnstar Bay and the Lower Level. A path north of the entrance leads into the harbor, and the road to the east leads to the rest of the Upper Level. Along the way are several Dawnstar businesses including the &lt;a href=\"Windpeak%20Inn\"&gt;Windpeak Inn&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Iron-Breaker%20Mine\"&gt;Iron-Breaker Mine&lt;/a&gt;, the source of Dawnstar's Iron deposit. In the middle of the Upper Level is &lt;a href=\"the%20White%20Hall\"&gt;the White Hall&lt;/a&gt;, which is the seat of power in Dawnstar, home to the local &lt;a href=\"Jarl\"&gt;Jarl&lt;/a&gt;. The path eventually revolves around to the Lower Level, where many of the residents have inhabited. Houses surround the bay, as people move to and fro with the trade. To the west is &lt;a href=\"Quicksilver%20Mine\"&gt;Quicksilver Mine&lt;/a&gt;, which is the home of Dawnstar's Quicksilver deposit. Continuing onto the beach in the Lower East will lead you out of the city, where you can eventually discover the main entrance to the Dark Brotherhood Sanctuary and a path to the Lighthouse. Between the White Hall and the &lt;a href=\"Dawnstar%20Barracks\"&gt;Dawnstar Barracks&lt;/a&gt; is a faded path that leads to the main road and the Tower of Dawn.\nHistory.\n&lt;a href=\"Second%20Era\"&gt;Second Era&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe Reign of Versidue Shaie; the Council of Bardmont.\nWith the death of &lt;a href=\"Reman%20Cyrodiil%20III\"&gt;Reman Cyrodiil III&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"1E%202920\"&gt;1E 2920&lt;/a&gt;, his &lt;a href=\"Potentate\"&gt;Potentate&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Versidue%20Shaie\"&gt;Versidue Shaie&lt;/a&gt; had named the end of the first era, bringing about the second era, and with much controversy. The various vassal kingdoms through the Empire had begun to rebel against the Potentate, unwilling to pay taxes and to disrupt Imperial garrisons throughout the realms. It would cause serious problems for Shaie, and it reached its pinnacle with the destruction of his fortress in Dawnstar. Because of this transgression, Versidue Shaie had gathered the &lt;a href=\"Elder%20Council\"&gt;Elder Council&lt;/a&gt; in the township of &lt;a href=\"Bardmont\"&gt;Bardmont&lt;/a&gt;, to hold the &lt;a href=\"Council%20of%20Bardmont\"&gt;Council of Bardmont&lt;/a&gt;. Shaie would take on a totalitarian role, establishing a universal martial law all over the Empire. What followed was thirty-seven years of bloody and gruesome conflicts that the continent had yet to withstand. Shaie's Grand Army had crushed the various Kingdoms. At that point, the only people who benefitted at this time were criminals. Eventually, Shaie would be assassinated for the years of conflict.\nThe Eastern Kingdom &amp; the Ebonheart Pact.\nOne of Versidue Shaie's allies was &lt;a href=\"High%20King%20Logrolf\"&gt;High King Logrolf&lt;/a&gt;, the leader of Skyrim. At one point, Logrolf was assassinated by an unknown assailant. Naturally, the next of kin would take the position of &lt;a href=\"High%20King\"&gt;High King&lt;/a&gt; and so the &lt;a href=\"Crown%20of%20Verity\"&gt;Crown of Verity&lt;/a&gt; was passed onto &lt;a href=\"Freydis\"&gt;Freydis&lt;/a&gt;. Though this did not come without its controversy, &lt;a href=\"Jarl%20Svartr\"&gt;Jarl Svartr&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"Solitude\"&gt;Solitude&lt;/a&gt; had accused Freydis of being an illegitimate heir to the throne and that he is the better candidate for the throne. This issue caused a schism in Skyrim that chose between Freydis and Svartr. The Crown of Verity had chosen Freydis to be the High Queen, and so the Nords of the &lt;a href=\"Old%20Holds\"&gt;Old Holds&lt;/a&gt; had started to follow Freydis. A &lt;a href=\"Moot\"&gt;Moot&lt;/a&gt; was held between the Jarls of Skyrim, and in the end, Svartr was chosen to be the High King, and so the Nords of &lt;a href=\"West%20Skyrim\"&gt;West Skyrim&lt;/a&gt; had started to follow Svartr. Skyrim was split into two Kingdoms and Dawnstar sided with East Skyrim. Several years later, &lt;a href=\"Jorunn%20the%20Skald-King\"&gt;Jorunn the Skald-King&lt;/a&gt; had created the &lt;a href=\"Ebonheart%20Pact\"&gt;Ebonheart Pact&lt;/a&gt; in the aftermath of the &lt;a href=\"Second%20Akaviri%20Invasion\"&gt;Second Akaviri Invasion&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"2E%20572\"&gt;2E 572&lt;/a&gt;. Dawnstar's forces were a part of the Nordic defense in the Invasion as well as the Ebonheart Pact.\n&lt;a href=\"Third%20Era\"&gt;Third Era&lt;/a&gt;.\nDawnstar during the Imperial Simulacrum.\nDuring the &lt;a href=\"Imperial%20Simulacrum\"&gt;Imperial Simulacrum&lt;/a&gt; from &lt;a href=\"3E%20389\"&gt;3E 389&lt;/a&gt; to &lt;a href=\"3E%20399\"&gt;3E 399&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Emperor\"&gt;Emperor&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Uriel%20Septim%20VII\"&gt;Uriel Septim VII&lt;/a&gt; was imprisoned along with &lt;a href=\"Talin%20Warhaft\"&gt;Talin Warhaft&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;a href=\"Deadlands\"&gt;Deadlands&lt;/a&gt; by &lt;a href=\"Jagar%20Tharn\"&gt;Jagar Tharn&lt;/a&gt;. Tharn planned for months to capture the throne, and he was able to achieve so in ten years. Tharn had a powerful weapon called the &lt;a href=\"Staff%20of%20Chaos\"&gt;Staff of Chaos&lt;/a&gt;, and he split it into nine pieces and scattered them across Tamriel, the staff was the only thing keeping Uriel Septim and Warhaft in &lt;a href=\"Oblivion\"&gt;Oblivion&lt;/a&gt;. A warrior escaped his clutches and traveled all corners of Tamriel to retrieve the missing pieces. The hero was known as the &lt;a href=\"Eternal%20Champion\"&gt;Eternal Champion&lt;/a&gt;, and he assembled the staff and defeated Jagar Tharn at the &lt;a href=\"Imperial%20Palace\"&gt;Imperial Palace&lt;/a&gt;. The Eternal Champion had at one point visited the city of Dawnstar in their quest to recover the pieces. The city of Dawnstar was under the rule of &lt;a href=\"King%20Ulrarne\"&gt;King Ulrarne&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe Alliance of Dawnstar &amp; Solitude.\nDuring the waning years of the third era, the Kingdom of Dawnstar was under the leadership of &lt;a href=\"Queen%20Macalla\"&gt;Queen Macalla&lt;/a&gt;. It was at this time, the northern kingdoms of Skyrim were undergoing a renaissance and territories were uniting. &lt;a href=\"King%20Thian\"&gt;King Thian&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"Solitude\"&gt;Solitude&lt;/a&gt; married Macalla to establish an alliance between the two city-states. Both Solitude and Dawnstar would expand their boundaries and into former Imperial fiefdoms, ones that were captured by &lt;a href=\"Uriel%20Septim%20V\"&gt;Uriel Septim V&lt;/a&gt; during his reign in &lt;a href=\"3E%20271\"&gt;3E 271&lt;/a&gt;. One of these locations was &lt;a href=\"Roscrea\"&gt;Roscrea&lt;/a&gt;, an island fiefdom situated north of Solitude, in the &lt;a href=\"Sea%20of%20Ghosts\"&gt;Sea of Ghosts&lt;/a&gt;. Roscrea was just the stepping stone for future expeditions for the alliance. The two would continue this alliance into the fourth era. It is unknown how long this relationship lasted since it was never mentioned again.\n&lt;a href=\"Fourth%20Era\"&gt;Fourth Era&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe Waking Nightmare over Dawnstar.\nDuring the &lt;a href=\"Skyrim%20Civil%20War\"&gt;Skyrim Civil War&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"4E%20201\"&gt;4E 201&lt;/a&gt;, the city-state of Dawnstar was ruled by &lt;a href=\"Skald%20the%20Elder\"&gt;Skald the Elder&lt;/a&gt;, who was an old and arrogant man, one of the most staunch supporters of the &lt;a href=\"Stormcloaks\"&gt;Stormcloaks&lt;/a&gt;. Skald Felgief was more occupied with the Civil War rather than protecting his own people, which becomes evident with the recent situation. The Tower of Dawn was revamped into a temple dedicated to &lt;a href=\"Vaermina\"&gt;Vaermina&lt;/a&gt;, and so the &lt;a href=\"Skull%20of%20Corruption\"&gt;Skull of Corruption&lt;/a&gt; was stored within the depths. Because of this, the people of Dawnstar were inflicted with nightmares, torturing them every night. A Priest of &lt;a href=\"Mara\"&gt;Mara&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Erandur\"&gt;Erandur&lt;/a&gt; traveled to Dawnstar to help them with the problem. Erandur called upon the help of a &lt;a href=\"Last%20Dragonborn\"&gt;mysterious traveler&lt;/a&gt; to deal with the threat. A strange gas called &lt;a href=\"the%20Miasma\"&gt;the Miasma&lt;/a&gt; had spewed out from the &lt;a href=\"Nightcaller%20Temple\"&gt;Nightcaller Temple&lt;/a&gt; and afflicted the Vaermina cult and the &lt;a href=\"Orc\"&gt;Orc&lt;/a&gt;ish invaders. Both Erandur and the traveler fought through waves of these cultists and Orcs, eventually finding the Skull of Corruption in the Inner Sanctum. The fate of both the Staff and Erandur are unknown, but Dawnstar's nightmare had ended, and the city was saved.\nThe Dark Brotherhood's resurgance in Dawnstar.\nAround the same time, the &lt;a href=\"Dark%20Brotherhood\"&gt;Dark Brotherhood&lt;/a&gt; had taken refuge in the long-abandoned Brotherhood Sanctuary in Dawnstar, when their original sanctuary in &lt;a href=\"Falkreath%20Hold\"&gt;Falkreath Hold&lt;/a&gt; was burned to the ground by the &lt;a href=\"Penitus%20Oculatus\"&gt;Penitus Oculatus&lt;/a&gt;. The Keeper of the &lt;a href=\"Night%20Mother\"&gt;Night Mother&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Cicero\"&gt;Cicero&lt;/a&gt; had fled to this sanctuary when he attacked &lt;a href=\"Astrid\"&gt;Astrid&lt;/a&gt;, leader of the Falkreath Chapter before the sanctuary's raze. The Brotherhood had severely injured Cicero, who fled into the wilderness. His fate is currently unknown. The very few survivors of the Falkreath Sanctuary had resided in the Dawnstar Sanctuary, along with the Night Mother. The outcome of the Dawnstar Chapter is currently unknown. Before their occupation, an &lt;a href=\"Udefrykte\"&gt;Udefrykte&lt;/a&gt; had lived in the icy caves until it was killed by the Brotherhood.\nUnknown Era.\nThe Tale of Dawnstar &amp; the Starfrost.\nAt some point, Dawnstar was governed by &lt;a href=\"Governor%20Vinticae\"&gt;Governor Cyril Vinticae&lt;/a&gt;. During his reign, Dawnstar was besieged by the &lt;a href=\"Ice%20Tribe%20%28Dawnstar%29\"&gt;Ice Tribes&lt;/a&gt;, a group of humanoid creatures that lived in the area. Four champions were residing in Dawnstar, one of them was the traitor that let the Ice Tribes enter the city. Unable to determine the traitor, Vinticae banished all four of them to the wilderness. To uncover them, Vinticae hired an unknown hero to traverse the Pale in order to meet with each of the four, and determine who the traitor was. The Traitor's identity is unknown, but they were brought to justice in Dawnstar. But the Ice Tribes started to invade Dawnstar again with their powerful ally, the &lt;a href=\"Gehenoth%20Thriceborn\"&gt;Gehenoth Thriceborn&lt;/a&gt; and the traitor. With the power of the &lt;a href=\"Starfrost\"&gt;Starfrost&lt;/a&gt; given from Vinticae, the hero was able to defeat the Gehenoth and saved the exile post of Dawnstar."}

So little of what I have learned matters now - the petty politics of ancient times, the age-long campaign to wipe out all mention of the &lt;a href=\"Gauldur\"&gt;Gauldur&lt;/a&gt; name.\nI know not what awaits us within &lt;a href=\"Folgunthur\"&gt;Folgunthur&lt;/a&gt;, so here, then, is the truth of the tale, as best I have been able to piece it together.\nIn the opening days of the &lt;a href=\"First%20Era\"&gt;First Era&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"Arch-Mage\"&gt;Archmage&lt;/a&gt; Gauldur was revered throughout the north. Wisdom, wealth, honor, and power were his, and even &lt;a href=\"Ysgramor\"&gt;Ysgramor&lt;/a&gt;'s heirs sought his counsel.\nSmother by his shadow, Gauldor's three sons grew cruel and resentful. They lusted after their father's power and prestige, and eventually &lt;a href=\"Jyrik%20Gauldurson\"&gt;Jyrik&lt;/a&gt;, the eldest, discovered its source: a mysterious amulet, from which he never parted. Together, they conspired to murder their father in his sleep and divide his amulet between them. And so it was done.\nConsumed by their newfound power, the brothers laid waste to the surrounding villages. So great was the carnage that the High King himself intervened, sending a company of battlemages led by the Archmage &lt;a href=\"Geirmund\"&gt;Geirmund&lt;/a&gt; to subdue the brothers. And after a devastating battle, the three fled the field.\n&lt;a href=\"Mikrul%20Gauldurson\"&gt;Mikrul&lt;/a&gt;, the youngest, was run to ground in Folgunthur, the ancient at the foot of &lt;a href=\"Solitude%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Solitude&lt;/a&gt;. And though he fought for three days and nights, he was at last overcome and entombed there, his crypt sealed by an &lt;a href=\"Ivory%20Dragon%20Claw\"&gt;ivory claw&lt;/a&gt;.\nGeirmund pursued Jyrik to the shattered crypts of &lt;a href=\"Saarthal\"&gt;Saarthal&lt;/a&gt;, half-buried even then. Ten veteran wizards fell before Jyrik's elemental magic, but he could not overcome them all together. He too fell, and was sealed within the ruined city.\nAnd at last, &lt;a href=\"Sigdis%20Gauldurson\"&gt;Sigdis&lt;/a&gt; was cornered in the southernmost reaches of Skyrim. He challenged the Lord Geirmund to a duel, knowing his foe was honor-bound to accept. And they clashed in battle, matched strength for strength, and fell together on the field before &lt;a href=\"Ivarstead%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Ivarstead&lt;/a&gt;. The High King ordered a tomb built for Geirmund on the lake which still bears his name and had Sigdis sealed within, forever guarded by the one who slew him.\nGaulder himself was interred in a cave not far from where his tower once stood, in the place called &lt;a href=\"Reachwater%20Rock\"&gt;Reachwater Rock&lt;/a&gt;. And when it was done, King &lt;a href=\"Harald\"&gt;Harald&lt;/a&gt; issued an edict: the name and deeds of Gauldor and his sons were to be expunged from every record, every chronicle. Under pain of death, no word of them was to be spoken, lest any try to recover the amulet that had been sealed at so great a cost.\nAnd so it was done. But a little survived the ages. Enough.\nFour thousand years have passed, and the tombs remain sealed. The fragments of &lt;a href=\"The%20Gauldur%20Amulet\"&gt;The Gauldur Amulet&lt;/a&gt; lie within. Since the day I first heard the rumor, I have felt its power, calling to me, pulling at me. I will be the one to reclaim it, restore it, bear it out into the world once more. I must have it. I must!"}

I have never had children of my own, but I have many nieces and nephews and cousins who have been raised with the tales and traditions of our ancient, illustrious, and occasionally notorious clan, the &lt;a href=\"Direnni%20Bloodline\"&gt;Direnni&lt;/a&gt;. Few families in &lt;a href=\"Tamriel\"&gt;Tamriel&lt;/a&gt; can boast so many famous figures, wielding so much power over the fate of so many. Our warriors and kings are stuff of legend, and it is not to dismiss their honor and their achievements to say you have heard quite enough about them.\nI myself have never picked up a &lt;a href=\"Swords%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;sword&lt;/a&gt; or written an important law, but I am part of a lesser known but still important Direnni tradition: the way of the wizard. My own autobiography would be of little interest to posterity \u2014 though my nephew, nieces, and cousins indulge me to tell wild tales of life in the chaotic &lt;a href=\"Second%20Era\"&gt;Second Era&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"Tamriel\"&gt;Tamriel&lt;/a&gt; \u2014 but I have a few ancestors whose stories should be told. They may have changed history as we know it as dramatically as my better known relatives, but their names are in danger of being forgotten.\nMost recently, &lt;a href=\"Lysandus\"&gt;Lysandus&lt;/a&gt;, the King of &lt;a href=\"Daggerfall\"&gt;Daggerfall&lt;/a&gt;, was able to conquer his ancient enemies of Sentinel in part thanks to his court sorceress, &lt;a href=\"Medora%20Direnni\"&gt;Medora Direnni&lt;/a&gt;. Her grandfather &lt;a href=\"Jovron%20Direnni\"&gt;Jovron Direnni&lt;/a&gt; was&lt;a href=\"%20Imperial%20Battlemage\"&gt; Imperial Battlemage&lt;/a&gt; to the court of the Dunmer Empress of Tamriel, &lt;a href=\"Katariah\"&gt;Katariah&lt;/a&gt;, assisting her in creating peace in a time of turmoil. His great great grandfather &lt;a href=\"Pelladil%20Direnni\"&gt;Pelladil Direnni&lt;/a&gt; had a similar role with the first &lt;a href=\"Versidue%20Shaie\"&gt;Potentate&lt;/a&gt;, and encouraged the &lt;a href=\"Guilds%20Act\"&gt;Guild Act&lt;/a&gt; without which we would not have all the professional organizations we have today. His ancestor, many times back, was the witch &lt;a href=\"Raven%20Direnni\"&gt;Raven Direnni&lt;/a&gt;, who with her better known cousins &lt;a href=\"Aiden%20Direnni\"&gt;Aiden&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Ryain%20Direnni\"&gt;Ryain&lt;/a&gt;, brought an end to the tyranny of the latter &lt;a href=\"Alessian%20Order\"&gt;Alessian Empire&lt;/a&gt;. Before the &lt;a href=\"Psijic%20Order\"&gt;Psijics of Artaeum&lt;/a&gt;, it is said, she created the art of enchantment, learning how to bind a soul into a gem and use that to ensorcel all manners of weaponry.\nBut it is the story of an ancestor even more ancient, more distant than Raven I wish to tell.\n&lt;a href=\"Asliel%20Direnni\"&gt;Asliel Direnni&lt;/a&gt; harkens back to the humble beginnings of our clan, in the tiny farming village of Tyrigel on the banks of the river Caomus which was then called the Diren, hence the family name. Like all on Summurset Isle in those days, he was a simple planter of the fields. But while others only grew enough to sustain their immediate kin, even distant cousins of the Dirennis worked together. They would decide as a group which fields were best for wheat, orchard, vine, livestock, or apiary, and thereby always have the best yields of any farm which worked alone, doing the best as it could with what it had.\nAsliel had a particularly poor farm for most kind of agriculture, but small herbs found its stony, loamless, acidic soil very comfortable. Out of necessity more than anything else he became an expert on all manners of herbs. For the most part, of course, they were used in flavoring cooking, but as you know, hardly any plant grows on the surface of our world without a magickal potential.\nEven so long ago, witches already were in existence. It would be ridiculous for me to suggest that Asliel Direnni invented alchemy. What he did, what we can all be grateful for, is that he formulated it into an art and science.\nThere were no witches' covens in Tyrigel, and, of course, there would be no &lt;a href=\"Mages%20Guild\"&gt;Mages Guild&lt;/a&gt; yet for thousands of years, so people would come to him for cures. He learned for himself the exact formula for combining black lichen and roobrush to create a cure for all manners of poison, and the amount of willow anther to crush and mix with chokeweed to cure diseases.\nThere were few much greater threats in Tyrigel in those peaceful days than disease or accidental poisonings. Yes, there were some dark forces in the wilderness, trolls, chimera, the occasional malevolent fairy folk and Will-O-The-Wisp, but even the youngest, most foolish &lt;a href=\"Altmer\"&gt;Altmer&lt;/a&gt; knew how to avoid them. There were, however, a few unusual threats which Asliel had a hand in defeating.\nOne of the tales told of him that I believe to be true is how he was brought a young niece who had been suffering from an unknown disease. Despite his ministrations, she grew weaker and weaker every morning. Finally, he gave her a bitter tasting drink, and the next morning, ashes were found all around her bed. A vampire had been feeding on the poor girl, but Asliel's potion had turned her very blood into poison, without harming her in the least.\nIf only this formula had not been lost in the mists of history!\nThis would have been enough to make him a minor but significant figure in the annals of early Summurset, but at that point in history, a barbarian tribe called the Locvar had found their way down the Diren River, and recognized Tyrigel as a rich target for raids. The Direnni, not being warriors yet but simple farmers, were helpless and could only flee and watch the Locvar take the best of their crops, raid after raid.\nAsliel, however, had been experimenting with the vampire dust, and brought his cousins to him with a plan. The next time the Locvar were sighted on the Diren, the word went out and all the most able-bodied came to Asliel's laboratory. When the barbarians arrived in Tyrigel, they found the farms deserted, and assumed that all had fled as usual. As they set about stealing the bounty, they suddenly found themselves under attack by invisible forces. Believing the Direnni farms to be haunted, they ran away very quickly.\nThey attempted a few more raids, for their greed would always eventually overpower their fear, and each time, they were set upon by attackers who they could not see. As barbaric as they were, they were not stupid, and they changed their mind about the source of their defeat. It could not be that the farms were haunted, because the crops were still being tended and harvested, and the animals seemed to show no fear. The Locvar decided to send a scout to the farm to see if he could spy their secrets.\nThe scout sent word back to the Locvar that the Direnni farms were populated with flesh and blood, entirely visible Altmer. He continued to watch as his barbarian cohorts moved down the river, and he saw the elderly and children flee for the hills, while the able-bodied farmers and their wives went to Asliel's laboratory. He saw them go in; he saw no one come out.\nAs usual, the Locvar were repelled by invisible forces, but their scout soon told them what he saw happening in the laboratory.\nThe next night, two of the Locvar approached Asliel's farm very stealthily, and managed to kidnap him without alerting the rest of the Direnni. The Locvar chieftain, knowing that the farmers could no longer count on the alchemist to make them invisible, considered an immediate attack on the farms. But he was a vengeful sort, and felt he had been humiliated by these simple farmers. A crafty plan emerged in his mind. What if the Direnni, who always saw his barbarian tribe coming, for once did not? Imagine the slaughter if no one even had a chance to flee.\nThe scout had told the chieftain that Asliel had used the dust of a vampire to make the farmers invisible, but he was not sure what the other ingredient had been. He described an incandescent powder that Asliel had mixed into the dust. Asliel, of course, refused to help the Locvar, but they were experts in torture as well as pillage, and he knew he would have to talk or die.\nFinally after hours of torture, he agreed to tell them what the incandescent powder was. He did not know the name, but he called it \"&lt;a href=\"Glow%20Dust\"&gt;Glow Dust&lt;/a&gt;,\" the only remains of a slain Will-O-The-Wisp. He told them they would need a lot of it if they wanted to turn the whole tribe invisible for the raid.\nThe Locvar grumbled that not only did they have to find and kill a vampire to attain his dust, but find and kill several Will-O-The-Wisps to get theirs. In a few days time, they came back with the ingredients the alchemist asked for. The chieftain, not being a complete idiot, made Asliel taste the potion first. He did as he was told and turned invisible, demonstrating that it did truly work. The chieftain put him to work creating more. No one apparently noticed that while he did, he was nibbling on black lichen and roobrush.\nThe Locvar took the potion as he doled it out, and soon, but not too soon that they didn't suffer, they were all dead.\nThe scout who had seen Asliel mixing the invisibility potion had apparently mistook the glow of the candlelight in the laboratory for an incandescence which the second ingredient of the invisibility potion did not possess. The second ingredient was actually dull, simple redwort, one of the most common herbs in Tamriel. When they had insisted during torture that Asliel tell them what the incandescent powder was, Asliel remembered that he had once experimentally mixed glow dust and vampire dust together once and created a powerful poison. It was simple enough to steal a little redwort from the barbarian's camp, mix that with the vampire and glow dust mixture, and create a potion that was in fact an invisibility poison. After curing himself, he gave the poison to the barbarians.\nThe Locvar, being dead, never again raided the Direnni farms, and having no other enemies, they were able to grow more and more prosperous and powerful. Generations later, they left Summurset and began their historic adventures on the Tamriel mainland. Asliel Direnni, because of his excellence as an alchemist, was invited to &lt;a href=\"Artaeum\"&gt;Artaeum&lt;/a&gt; and became a &lt;a href=\"Psijic%20Order\"&gt;Psijic&lt;/a&gt;. It is not known how many more of the common formulas we know today were invented by him there, but I have no doubt, the science and art of alchemy as we know it today would not exist without him.\nBut that is all in the distant past. Asliel's innovations, like my modest ones, like the achievements of the Dirennis throughout history, are but a stepping stone to the wonders which will come in the future. I wish I could be there to witness them, but if I can only share some of the past with the children of Direnni and the children of Tamriel, then I will consider my life well spent."}

It is a &lt;a href=\"Forsworn\"&gt;Forsworn&lt;/a&gt; stronghold, with its leader being the Hagraven Drascua. It can be accessed by going through &lt;a href=\"Hag%20Rock%20Redoubt\"&gt;Hag Rock Redoubt&lt;/a&gt;. A &lt;a href=\"Word%20Walls%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Word Wall&lt;/a&gt; for the &lt;a href=\"Dismay\"&gt;Dismay&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"shout\"&gt;shout&lt;/a&gt; is at the top.\nThe entrance is similar to other old towers scattered across Skyrim, but quickly becomes a proper dungeon. A chest and several urns are at the top of the first set of stairs to the northwest. The path turns left (southwest), where a Forsworn sits at a table at the end of the hall. Halfway down the hall, a spiral set of wooden steps leads up to a level with a room with an open doorway, an adept locked door, and a closed gate with a lever activated switch which is located in another room that can be seen through an opening in the wall. There are several more Forsworn here, along with a &lt;a href=\"Frost%20Atronach%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;frost atronach&lt;/a&gt;\u00a0or &lt;a href=\"Flame%20Atronach%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;flame atronach&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe locked door opens to a short hallway southeast that turns left (northeast), with a pressure plate activated battering ram trap. At the other end is a door back outside where there is a chest and an urn. At the end of the pathway is a soul gem and iron arrows.\nThe open doorway leads to a room with a Forsworn and a &lt;a href=\"Soul%20Gem%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;soul gem&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Traps%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;fire trap&lt;/a&gt;. Also in this room is an &lt;a href=\"arcane%20enchanter\"&gt;arcane enchanter&lt;/a&gt; and a &lt;a href=\"Containers%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;chest&lt;/a&gt;. At the northeast end of the room, a small hallway turns right, where a fire trap waits. The hallway eventually leads to the room with the switch to open the gate. The &lt;a href=\"Alchemy%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Alchemy&lt;/a&gt; skill book \"&lt;a href=\"A%20Game%20at%20Dinner\"&gt;A Game at Dinner&lt;/a&gt;\" lies in front of the lever. At this point, backtracking to the room with the locked gate will reveal it is now open.\nThe gate leads to a door exiting outside. There are wooden stairs leading up: halfway up them is a landing with a chest against the southwest wall. At the top of the stairs is the top of the tower, with\u00a0the &lt;a href=\"Word%20Walls%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Word Wall&lt;/a&gt; guarded by the &lt;a href=\"Hagraven%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;hagraven&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Drascua\"&gt;Drascua&lt;/a&gt;.\nIn front of the altar are three enchanted pedestals powered by &lt;a href=\"Soul%20Gem%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;soul gems&lt;/a&gt; that shoot fire when anyone is in their range, and will continue to do so until the soul gem is removed. To the right (north) of the table is a chest with leveled loot.\nTo the east there is a small platform with four urns that can be accessed using the &lt;a href=\"Whirlwind%20Sprint\"&gt;Whirlwind Sprint&lt;/a&gt; shout."}

{"id": "171063", "revid": "32045548", "url": "https://elderscrolls.fandom.com/wiki?curid=171063", "title": "Dead Drop Falls", "text": "Dead Drop Falls is a &lt;a href=\"Locations%20%28Dawnguard%29\"&gt;location&lt;/a&gt; in .\nIt is a cave which can only be reached by passing through &lt;a href=\"Fort%20Dawnguard\"&gt;Fort Dawnguard&lt;/a&gt;.\nDescription.\nThe cave contains a waterfall and a hole. There is a small lake at the bottom which can be reached by jumping down the hole. There are two paths at the bottom, each partially submerged in water. One is an ascending spiral which will eventually lead to a lever and upwards to the beginning of the cave and thereby its exit/entrance. The other path will lead to a big open area where several &lt;a href=\"Traps%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;traps&lt;/a&gt; are located.\nBridge puzzle.\nThere is a bridge puzzle in this room. To lower both bridges and to solve subsequent puzzles the &lt;a href=\"Last%20Dragonborn\"&gt;Dragonborn&lt;/a&gt; needs a projectile weapon (such as a &lt;a href=\"Bows%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;bow&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"Crossbows%20%28Dawnguard%29\"&gt;crossbow&lt;/a&gt;), or any form of projectile magic (such as &lt;a href=\"Firebolt%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Firebolt&lt;/a&gt;, Magelight or even &lt;a href=\"shouts\"&gt;shouts&lt;/a&gt;). First pull the lever, then shoot the target which hangs on the pillar behind the lever. Both bridges will be lowered. Alternately, pulling the lever so the first bridge is down and then pulling it again and sprinting across the bridge can get you across. Any &lt;a href=\"Followers%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;followers&lt;/a&gt; will be trapped on the wrong side of the bridge, though they will re-spawn when you enter another area.\nThe third and final bridge can be lowered by pulling an adjacent lever. This closes an iron gate at the platform the bridge leads to, while also closing another gate behind the first. Because of this alternation between the two gates, just as with the alternation of the two bridges earlier, it is impossible to pass through solely by operating the lever adjacent to the last bridge.\nIn addition, the lever also operates the last bridge which provides access to the platform. Walk up to the closed gate and then turn around to face another target. There is also a chest which can be seen at water level, though it can be found by traditional exploring of the pool of water in this area as well. Shooting the target will open the locked gate, but close the one behind it.\nFrom inside the space between the gates, past the first opened gate and before the second closed gate, shoot the same target again and the next gate will open. The previous gate however will close and prevent backtracking. This area can be accessed again by completely passing through the next area, Dead Drop Mine (below), and retracing steps back to the bottom of the falls and into the cavern. Alternatively, from the right position, an arrow or bolt can be shot through the bars of the gate to reactivate the target switch and open the door.\nIn addition to the intended method of going through this puzzle, if the Dragonborn pulls the lever and then runs up bridges before they are fully upright, the bridge section of the\u00a0puzzle can be skipped.\nCavern with pressure plates.\nThe gate must be opened by placing an object on all three floor pressure plates (there is already a book on the left pressure plate), then shooting the pressure plate above the locked door. The items can be picked up after the gate is open or a follower can stand on a pressure plate and the Dragonborn on the last one. After the gate is open, it is safe to retrieve the items again. Facing this gate, a ledge can be seen to the right where a hidden chest can be found towards the back. It is possible to climb up by hopping on the steep rock slope directly to the right of the gate, then onto the ledge.\nNote: It is actually not necessary to place anything on the three pressure plates. When each plate is stepped on that plate remains active for approx. 10 seconds. This allows one to walk across all three floor plates and then quickly fire on the wall plate. If one has no items to activate the pressure plates, there is a barrel on the right of the room with three sacks of flour which can be used.\nAround the corner is another locked gate. It can be opened by shooting at the pressure plate above the gate. It will close in a short time, so it requires either sprinting through the hallway and gate before it closes or using the &lt;a href=\"Whirlwind%20Sprint\"&gt;Whirlwind Sprint&lt;/a&gt; shout. There are several useful items in the next room. There are some &lt;a href=\"Exploding%20Steel%20Bolts%20of%20Fire\"&gt;Exploding Steel Bolts of Fire&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Exploding%20Steel%20Bolts%20of%20Ice\"&gt;Exploding Steel Bolts of Ice&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Exploding%20Steel%20Bolts%20of%20Shock\"&gt;Exploding Steel Bolts of Shock&lt;/a&gt; as well as a chest with &lt;a href=\"Random%20Loot%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;random loot&lt;/a&gt;. The book \"&lt;a href=\"Confessions%20of%20a%20Khajiit%20Fur%20Trader\"&gt;Confessions of a Khajiit Fur Trader&lt;/a&gt;\" can be found on the table. The next door will lead to Dead Drop Mine.\nDead Drop Mine.\nDead Drop Mine contains four &lt;a href=\"corundum%20ore\"&gt;corundum ore&lt;/a&gt; veins, two &lt;a href=\"Crossbows%20%28Dawnguard%29\"&gt;crossbows&lt;/a&gt;, the non-skill books \"&lt;a href=\"The%20Aetherium%20Wars\"&gt;The Aetherium Wars&lt;/a&gt;\" and \"&lt;a href=\"The%20Sultry%20Argonian%20Bard%2C%20v1\"&gt;The Sultry Argonian Bard, v1&lt;/a&gt;\", and some other minor loot. It is only a passage back to the bottom of the falls, and thus allows for an exit from the falls by taking the ascending spiral path back to the exit/entrance to the cave described above."}

The girl's family is outraged, of course, and has hired the Dark Brotherhood to make J 'Ghasta pay for his insolence.\nGo to J 'Ghasta's house in Bruma and end his miserable life. But be warned! The Khajiit is rich and bored, and spends most of his time honing his skills in unarmed combat. Any opponent who can kill with merely his hands is not to be trifled with, so tread carefully. Even worse, J 'Ghasta is aware someone may be trying to kill him, and has bribed the &lt;a href=\"City%20Watch\"&gt;guards&lt;/a&gt; not to interfere if a fight should spill out into the city streets.\nWhen the target has been eliminated, you will find your next dead drop in a rotten box under the &lt;a href=\"Old%20Bridge\"&gt;Old Bridge&lt;/a&gt;, just south of the &lt;a href=\"Imperial%20City%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;Imperial City&lt;/a&gt;.

You've done the world a great service, Silencer. It's time to continue the good work.\nYour next target is a traveling &lt;a href=\"Dunmer%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;Dark Elf&lt;/a&gt; merchant by the name of &lt;a href=\"Alval%20Uvani\"&gt;Alval Uvani&lt;/a&gt;, who is currently renting a house in the city of &lt;a href=\"Leyawiin%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;Leyawiin&lt;/a&gt;. Uvani is a well-respected tradesman back in his native &lt;a href=\"Morrowind\"&gt;Morrowind&lt;/a&gt;, but his business often takes him very far from home. Therein lies the problem. Alval Uvani's wife has become disillusioned with her husband's repeated, extended absences and wishes to dissolve their marriage, and has sought the Dark Brotherhood's assistance. Lucky for us &lt;a href=\"Cyrodiil\"&gt;Cyrodiil&lt;/a&gt; is a bit beyond the reach of Morrowind's &lt;a href=\"Morag%20Tong%20%28Morrowind%29\"&gt;Morag Tong&lt;/a&gt;.\nAlval Uvani is currently traveling around Cyrodiil, and is never in one place for more than a couple of days. In this dead drop you will also find an Alval Uvanis schedule detailing the Dark Elf's whereabouts; use it to locate him and plan your elimination. Be aware, however, that because he is forced to travel alone to the farthest reaches of the &lt;a href=\"Septim%20Empire\"&gt;Empire&lt;/a&gt;, Uvani has learned to defend himself. He is a master of the &lt;a href=\"Destruction%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;Destruction&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"school%20of%20Magicka\"&gt;school of Magicka&lt;/a&gt;, and is no stranger to killing.\nWhen Alval Uvani lies rotting, journey to the &lt;a href=\"Market%20District\"&gt;Market District&lt;/a&gt; of the &lt;a href=\"Imperial%20City%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;Imperial City&lt;/a&gt;. There you will find a shop called &lt;a href=\"Stonewall%20Shields\"&gt;Stonewall Shields&lt;/a&gt;. Your dead drop is located behind that building, in a hollowed-out tree stump. As usual, you will find your reward for the previous contract, as well as information on your next.\nAh yes, I must mention one last detail. Apparently Alval Uvani suffers from a rare Dark Elf condition, a serious allergy to honey. If you could somehow get Uvani to drink the honey-based spirit &lt;a href=\"Mead%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;Mead&lt;/a&gt;, perhaps by replacing his food, he would suffer from complete &lt;a href=\"Paralyze%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;paralyzation&lt;/a&gt;. This would certainly make the Dark Elf a bit easier to deal with."}

The chieftain's sister has forgone the Nord custom of extracting the monetary retribution of wergild, and instead wants Hoar-Blood to pay with his life. You, dear Silencer, will help put her family at peace.\nYou are to go to Gnoll Mountain, locate Havilstein Hoar-Blood, and send his soul to &lt;a href=\"Sithis\"&gt;Sithis&lt;/a&gt;.\nWhen Hoar-Blood has been executed, journey to the &lt;a href=\"Ayleid%20Ruins%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;Ayleid ruins&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"Nornal%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;Nornal&lt;/a&gt;.

Bravil is also home to an ancient statue known as the &lt;a href=\"Lucky%20Old%20Lady\"&gt;Lucky Old Lady&lt;/a&gt;. It is seen as a symbol of good &lt;a href=\"Luck%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;luck&lt;/a&gt; and prosperity, and the fools of Bravil often speak to the statue and wish for good tidings. Every night, poor lovestruck Ungolim visits the Lady and pleads desperately for the heart of a young maiden. This maiden is married, and her husband has learned of Ungolim's affection for his bride. He fears the competition, it would seem, and has commissioned the Dark Brotherhood to help in the matter.\nYou must go to Bravil, locate Ungolim, and kill him. The Wood Elf owns a house in the city, but he spends his days securely locked inside. I recommend you lie in wait at the Lucky Old Lady statue, and then eliminate Ungolim when he arrives for his nightly visit. He's generally there between the hours of 6:00 PM and 1:00 AM.\nBy all accounts, Ungolim is a deadly archer and a fearless opponent. I also have reason to believe he is expecting trouble, so if Ungolim senses danger, he may attack you on sight. And, like the &lt;a href=\"Khajiit%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;Khajiit&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"J%27Ghasta\"&gt;J'Ghasta&lt;/a&gt;, Ungolim has bribed the &lt;a href=\"City%20Watch\"&gt;guards&lt;/a&gt; to look the other way if there is a fight, so they won't interfere. Be vigilant, and bring the Wood Elf down! You must not fail!\nWhen Ungolim's body lies broken at the foot of his dear Lady, you must journey to the city of &lt;a href=\"Anvil%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;Anvil&lt;/a&gt;. Your dead drop is in a barrel located behind the statue in the pond. As is standard, your reward and next contract will be waiting."}

It's been many weeks since I've heard from you, and I hope that the address that I have for you is still up-to-date. I gave the courier some extra gold, so if he doesn't find you, he is to make inquiries to your whereabouts. As you can see, after a rather tedious crossing, I've at long last made my way from &lt;a href=\"Bhoriane\"&gt;Bhoriane&lt;/a&gt; to my favorite principality in High Rock, surprisingly literate and always fascinating Kambria. I at once ensconced myself in one of the better libraries here, becoming reacquainted with the locals and the lore. At the risk of being overly optimistic, I think I might have struck on something very interesting about this mysterious fellow, Hadwaf Neithwyr.\nMany here in town remember him, though few very fondly. When Hadwaf Neithwyr left, so too did a great plague. No one thinks it a coincidence.\nAccording to my contacts here, &lt;a href=\"Azura\"&gt;Azura&lt;/a&gt; is not his only master. It may be that when he summoned forth the &lt;a href=\"Daedra\"&gt;Daedra&lt;/a&gt; and accepted her &lt;a href=\"Azura%27s%20Star\"&gt;Star&lt;/a&gt;, he was doing so for someone named &lt;a href=\"Baliasir\"&gt;Baliasir&lt;/a&gt;. Apparently, Neithwyr worked for this Baliasir in some capacity, but I never could find out from anyone exactly what Baliasir's line of business was, nor what Neithwyr did for him. &lt;a href=\"Zenithar\"&gt;Zenithar&lt;/a&gt;, the God of Work and Commerce, is the most revered deity in Kambria, which served my (that is to say our) purposes well, as the people are naturally receptive to bribery. Still, it did me little good. I could find nothing specific about our quarry. After days of inquiry, an old crone recommended that I go to a nearby village called &lt;a href=\"Grimtry%20Garden\"&gt;Grimtry Garden&lt;/a&gt;, and find the cemetery caretaker there. I set off at once.\nI know you are impatient when it comes to details, and have little taste for &lt;a href=\"Breton\"&gt;Breton&lt;/a&gt; architecture, but if you ever find yourself in mid-High Rock, you owe it to yourself to visit this quaint village. Like a number of other similar towns in High Rock, there is a high wall surrounded it. As well as being picturesque, it's a remnant of the region's turbulent past and a useful barrier against the supernatural creatures that sometimes stalk the countryside. More about that in a moment.\nThe cemetery is actually outside of the city gates, I discovered. The locals warned me to wait until morning to speak to the caretaker, but I was impatient for information, and did not want to waste a moment. I trekked through the woods to the lonely graveyard, and immediately found the shuffling, elderly man who was the caretaker. He bade me leave, that the land was haunted and if I chose to stay I would be in the greatest danger. I told him that I would not go until he told me what he knew about Hadwaf Neithwyr and his patron Baliasir. On hearing their names, he fled deeper into the jumble of broken tombstones and decrepit mausoleums. I naturally pursued.\nI saw him scramble down into an enormous crypt and gave chase. There was no light within, but I had planned enough to bring with me a torch. The minute I lit it, I heard a long, savage howl pierce the silence, and I knew that the caretaker had left quickly not merely because he feared speaking of Neithwyr and Baliasir. Before I saw the creature, I heard its heavy breath and the clack of its clawed feet on stone moving closer to me. The werewolf emerged from the gloom, brown and black, with slavering jaws, looking at me with the eyes of the cemetery caretaker, now given only to animal hunger.\nI instantly had three different instinctive reactions. The first was, of course, flight. The second was to fight. But if I fled, I might never find the caretaker again, and learn what he knew. If I fought, I might injure or even kill the creature and be even worse off. So I elected to go with my third option: to hold my ground and keep the creature within its tomb until the night became morning, and the caretaker resumed his humanity.\nI've sparred often enough unarmored, but surely never with so much at stake, and never with so savage an opponent. My mind was always on danger not only of injury but the dread &lt;a href=\"disease\"&gt;disease&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"lycanthropy\"&gt;lycanthropy&lt;/a&gt;. Every rake of its claw I parried, every snap of its foaming jaws I ducked. I sidestepped when it tried to rush me, but closed the distance to keep it from escaping into the night. For hours we fought, I always on the defense, it always trying to free itself, or slay me, or both. I have no doubt that a werewolf has greater energy reserves than a man, but it is a beast and does not know how to save and temper its movements. As the dawn rose, we were both nearly unconscious from fatigue, but I received my reward. The creature became a man once again.\nHe was quite considerably friendlier than he had been before. In fact, when he realized that I had prevented him from going on his nocturnal rampage through the countryside, he became positively affable.\nHere's what I learned: Neithwyr never returned to High Rock. As far as the old man knows, he is still in &lt;a href=\"Morrowind\"&gt;Morrowind&lt;/a&gt;. I visited the gravesite of his sister &lt;a href=\"Peryra\"&gt;Peryra&lt;/a&gt;, and learned that it was probably through her that Neithwyr first met his patron. It would seem that she was quite a well-known courtesan in her day, and very well traveled, though she chose to return home to die. Unlike Neithwyr, Baliasir is not far away from me. He is a shadowy character, but lately, according to the caretaker, he has been paying court to Queen &lt;a href=\"Elysana\"&gt;Elysana&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Wayrest\"&gt;Wayrest&lt;/a&gt;. I leave at once.\nPlease write to me as soon as possible to tell me of your progress. I should be in Wayrest at the home of my friend Lady &lt;a href=\"Elysbetta%20Moorling\"&gt;Elysbetta Moorling&lt;/a&gt; in a week's time. If Baliasir is at court, Lady Moorling will be able to arrange an introduction.\nI feel confident in saying that we are very close to Azura's Star.\nYour Friend,\n&lt;a href=\"Charwich%20%28Character%29\"&gt;Charwich&lt;/a&gt;"}

I did not know how to reach you before to tell you of my progress finding &lt;a href=\"Hadwaf%20Neithwyr\"&gt;Hadwaf Neithwyr&lt;/a&gt;, so I send this to you now care of the lady you mentioned in your letter, the Lady &lt;a href=\"Elysbetta%20Moorling\"&gt;Elysbetta Moorling&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"Wayrest\"&gt;Wayrest&lt;/a&gt;. I hope that if you have left her palace, she will know where you've gone and can send this to you. And I hope further that you receive it in a timelier manner that I received your letter. It is essential that I hear from you soon so we may coordinate our next course of action.\nMy adventures here have two acts, one before I received your letter, and one immediately after. While you searched for the elusive possessor of &lt;a href=\"Azura%27s%20Star\"&gt;Azura's Star&lt;/a&gt; in his homeland to the west, I searched for him here where we understood he conjured up the &lt;a href=\"Daedra%20Prince\"&gt;Daedra Prince&lt;/a&gt; and received from her the artifact.\nLike you, I had little difficulty finding people who had heard of or even knew Neithwyr. In fact, not long after we parted company and you left for the &lt;a href=\"Iliac%20Bay\"&gt;Iliac Bay&lt;/a&gt;, I met someone who knew where he went to perform the ceremony, so I left at once to come here to Tel Aruhn. It took some time to locate my contact, for he is a &lt;a href=\"Dissident%20Priests\"&gt;Dissident Priests&lt;/a&gt; named &lt;a href=\"Minerath\"&gt;Minerath&lt;/a&gt;. The &lt;a href=\"Tribunal%20Temple\"&gt;Temple&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Tribunal\"&gt;Tribunal&lt;/a&gt;, the real powers of Morrowind, tend to frown on his Order, and while they haven't begun so much of crusade to stamp them out, there are certainly rumors that they will soon. This tends to make priests like Minerath skittish and paranoid. Difficult people to set appointments with.\nFinally I was told that he would be willing to talk to me at the &lt;a href=\"Plot%20and%20Plaster\"&gt;Plot and Plaster&lt;/a&gt;, a tiny tavern without even a room to rent. Downstairs, there were several cloaked men crammed around the tavern's only table, and they searched me to see if I had any weaponry. Of course, I hadn't. You know that isn't my preferred method of doing business.\nWhen it decided that I was harmless, one of the cloaked figures revealed himself to be Minerath. I paid him the &lt;a href=\"Septim%20%28Coin%29\"&gt;gold&lt;/a&gt; I promised and asked him what he knew about Hadwaf Neithwyr. He remembered him well enough, saying that after he received the Star, the lad intended to return to &lt;a href=\"High%20Rock\"&gt;High Rock&lt;/a&gt;. It seemed he had unfinished business there, presumably of a violent nature, which &lt;a href=\"Azura\"&gt;Azura&lt;/a&gt;'s Star would facilitate. He had no other information, and I did not know what else to ask.\nWe parted company and I waited for your letter, hoping you had found Neithwyr and perhaps even the Star. I confess that as I lingered in Morrowind and never heard from you, I began to have doubts about your character. You'll forgive me for saying so, but I began to fear that you had taken the artifact for yourself. In fact, I was making plans to come to High Rock myself when your letter came at last.\nThe tale of your adventure in the cemetery at Grimtry Garden, and the information you gathered from the lycanthropic caretaker inspired me to have another meeting with Minerath. Thus began the second act of my story.\nI returned to the Pot and Plaster, reasoning that the priest must frequent that area of the city to feel so comfortable setting clandestine meetings there. It took some time searching, but I finally found him, and as luck would have it, he was alone. I called his name, and he quickly drew me to a dark alleyway, nervous that we would be seen by a &lt;a href=\"Ordinators\"&gt;Temple ordinator&lt;/a&gt;.\nIt is a rare and beautiful thing when a victim insists on dragging his killer to a remote location.\nI began at once asking about this fellow you mentioned, Neithwyr's mysterious patron Baliasir. He denied ever having heard the name. We were still in that easy, fairly conversational state when I attacked the priest. Of course, he was completely taken by surprise. In some ways, that can be more effective than an ambush from behind. No matter how many times I've done it, no one ever expected the friendly man they're talking to grip them by the neck.\nI pressed hard against my favorite spot in the soft part of the throat, just below the thyroid cartilage, and it took him too long to react to my lunge and try pushing back. He began to lose consciousness, and I whispered that if I released my grip a little so he could talk and breathe, but he tried to call for help, I would snap his neck. He nodded, and I relaxed the pressure, just a bit.\nI asked him again about Baliasir, and he shook his head, insisting that he had never heard the name. As frightened as he was, it seemed most likely that he was telling the truth, so I asked him more generally if he knew anyone else who might know something about Hadwaf Neithwyr. He told me that there was a woman present also during the ceremony, someone he introduced as his sister.\nI remembered then the part of your letter about seeing the grave of Neithwyr's sister, &lt;a href=\"Peryra\"&gt;Peryra&lt;/a&gt;. When I mentioned the name to the priest he nodded frantically, but I could see that the interrogation had reached an ending. There is, after all, something about being throttled that causes a man to answer yes to every question. I snapped Minerath's neck, and returned home.\nSo now I'm again unsure how to proceed. I've made several more inquiries and several of the same people who met Neithwyr remember him being with a woman. A few recall him saying that she was his sister. One or two believe they remember her name as being Peryra, though they're not certain. No one, however, has heard of anyone named Baliasir.\nIf I do not hear word from you in response to this in the next couple of weeks, I will come to High Rock, because it's there that most people believe Neithwyr returned. I will only stay here long enough to see if there are other inquiries I can make only in Morrowind to bring us closer to our goal of recovering Azura's Star.\nYour Friend,\n&lt;a href=\"Koniinge\"&gt;Koniinge&lt;/a&gt;"}

I can only reply in detail to one part of your letter, and that is that I fear &lt;a href=\"Baliasir\"&gt;Baliasir&lt;/a&gt;, contrary to what you've heard, is very much real. Had he been but a figment of that caretaker's imagination, I would not be feeling life ebb from me as I write this.\nLady Moorling has sent for healers, but I know they won't arrive in time. I just need to explain what happened so that you'll understand, and then all my affairs in this world will be ended. The one advantage of my condition is that I must be brief, without my habitually ornamental descriptions of people and places. I know that you will appreciate that at least.\nIt started when I came to &lt;a href=\"Wayrest\"&gt;Wayrest&lt;/a&gt;, and through my friend Lady Moorling and her court connections was introduced to Baliasir himself. I had to proceed carefully, not wanting him to know of our designs on &lt;a href=\"Azura%27s%20Star\"&gt;Azura's Star&lt;/a&gt; which I presumed he possessed, given to him by his servant Hadwaf Neithwyr. His function in Queen &lt;a href=\"Elysana\"&gt;Elysana&lt;/a&gt;'s court seemed to be decorative, like so many of her courtiers, and it was not hard to differentiate myself from the others when we began conversing on the school of mysticism. Many of the other hangers-on at the palace can speak eloquently on the subject of the magickal arts, but it seemed that only he and I had deep knowledge of the craft.\nMany a nobleman or adventurer who aren't mages by profession learn a spell or two from the useful schools of restoration or destruction. I told Baliasir quite truthfully that I had never learned any of that (oh, but I wish I knew some healing spells of the school of restoration now), but that I had developed some small skill in mysticism. Not enough to be a Psijic, of course, but in telekinesis, password, and spell reflection I had some amateur ability. He responded with compliments, which allowed me to segue into the topic of another spell of mysticism, the soul trap.\nI told him I was unlearned but curious about that spell. And very naturally and comfortably, I was able to bring up the subject of &lt;a href=\"Azura\"&gt;Azura&lt;/a&gt;'s Star, the endless well of souls.\nImagine how I had to hold back my excitement when he leaned in and whispered to me, \u201cIf that interests you, come to &lt;a href=\"Klythic%27s%20Cairn\"&gt;Klythic's Cairn&lt;/a&gt; west of the city tomorrow night.\u201d\nI couldn't sleep at all. The only thing I could think of was how I would get the Star when he showed it to me. I still knew so little about Baliasir, his past and his power, but the opportunity was too great to let pass. Still, I must admit that I held hopes that you would arrive, as you threatened you might in your letter, so I might have someone of physical strength to aid me in my adventure.\nI am growing weaker and weaker as I write this, so I must proceed with the basic facts. I went to the crypt the following night, and Baliasir led me through the maze of it to the repository where he kept the Star. We were talking quite casually, and as you've so often said, it seemed an excellent time for an ambush. I grabbed the Star and unsheathed my blade in what I felt was amazing speed.\nHe turned to me and I suddenly felt that I was moving like a snail. In a flash, Baliasir changed his form and became his true self, not man or mer, but daedra. A colossal daedra lord who swiped back the Star from my grasp and laughed at my sword as it thudded against his impenetrable hide.\nI knew I had been beaten, and I threw myself towards the corridor. A blue flash of energy coursed through me, flung by Baliasir's claws. At once, I began to feel death. He could have smote me with a thousand spells, but he chose the one where I could lie down, and suffer, and hear him laugh. At the very least, I did not give him that pleasure.\nAlready struck, it was too late for me to cast a counterspell of mysticism, one to dispel the magicka, reflect it or absorb it as my own. But I did still know how to teleport myself, what mystics term 'Recall,' to whatever place I'd last set a spiritual anchor. I confess that at the time, I didn't remember where that would be. Perhaps in Bhoriane when I arrived in the &lt;a href=\"Iliac%20Bay\"&gt;Iliac Bay&lt;/a&gt;, or in &lt;a href=\"Kambria\"&gt;Kambria&lt;/a&gt;, or in &lt;a href=\"Grimtry%20Garden\"&gt;Grimtry Garden&lt;/a&gt; where I met the caretaker, or my hostess's palace in Wayrest. I prayed that I had not set the anchor last when I was with you in Morrowind, for it said that if the distance is too great, one can be caught between dimensions. Still, I was willing to take that chance, rather than being the plaything of Baliasir.\nI cast the spell and found myself back on the doorstep of Lady Moorling's palace. To be out of the crypt and away from the daedra was a relief, but I had so hoped that I had been smart enough to cast an anchor near a Mages Guild or a temple where I could find a healer. Instead, knowing I was too weak to walk far, I beat on the door and was taken here, where I write this letter, lying in my bed.\nAs I wrote those words, dear Elysbetta, Lady Moorling, came in, quite tearfully and frantic, to tell me the healers should be here waiting but a few minute. But I will be dead were they arrve. I know theses are my last wors. There frend, stay away from this cursd place.\nYour Frend,\n&lt;a href=\"Charwich%20%28Character%29\"&gt;Charwich&lt;/a&gt;"}

I've left the front gate and door unlocked, and if you're reading this, you must have made it at least as far the antechamber to the east drawing room. Perhaps you've already wandered the estate and seen some of its delights before coming to this chamber: the seven fountains of marble and porphyry, the reflecting pool, the various groves, the colonnades and quincunx. I don't think you would have already gone to the second floor suites and the west wing as you would have had to pass this room first, and picked up this letter. But believe me, they're beautifully appointed with magnificent balustrades, winding staircases, intimate salons, and bedchambers worthy of your affluence.\nThe price of this property is exorbitant, certainly, but for a man like you who seeks only the best, this is the villa you must have. As you undoubtedly noticed as you arrived through the gates, there are several smaller buildings ideally suited to be guard stations. I know you are concerned with security.\nI am an intensely greedy man, and there is nothing I would have liked more than to meet you here today, show you the grounds, fawn on you obsequiously, and collect a fat percentage of the cost of the sale when you bought this marvelous palace, as I'm sure you would have. My dilemma that caused my inexcusable absence began shortly after I arrived here early to make certain the villa was well-cleaned for your inspection. A man named Koniinge crept up behind me, and gripped me by the throat. Clamping his left hand over my mouth and nose, and throttling me with his right hand, crushing the soft spot on my throat just below the thyroidal cartilage, he effectively strangled me in a few quick but very painful minutes.\nI am currently buried in a pile of leaves in the north statuary parterre, close to the exceptional sculptural representation of the Transformation of &lt;a href=\"Trinimac\"&gt;Trinimac&lt;/a&gt;. It should not be too long before I am discovered: someone at my bank will surely notice my absence in due time. &lt;a href=\"Koniinge\"&gt;Koniinge&lt;/a&gt; might have buried me deeper, but he wanted to be ready for the arrival of his old partner, &lt;a href=\"Charwich%20%28Character%29\"&gt;Charwich&lt;/a&gt;.\nPerhaps part of you thinks it best to stop reading now, Lord Gemyn. You are looking around the antechamber and seeing nothing but doors. The large one you took to come in from the garden is locked now behind you, and without a better knowledge of the layout of the estate, I could not recommend you attempt to flee down a corridor that might easily come to a dead end. No. Much better to keep reading, and see where this is going.\nKoniinge, it seems, was in a partnership with his friend Charwich to try to recover &lt;a href=\"Azura%27s%20Star\"&gt;Azura's Star&lt;/a&gt;. They understood it to be in the possession of someone named &lt;a href=\"Hadwaf%20Neithwyr\"&gt;Hadwaf Neithwyr&lt;/a&gt;, a man who conjured up the &lt;a href=\"Daedra%20Prince\"&gt;Daedra Prince&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Azura\"&gt;Azura&lt;/a&gt; herself to acquire it. As Neithwyr originally haled from &lt;a href=\"High%20Rock\"&gt;High Rock&lt;/a&gt;, Charwich went there to look for him, while his partner searched &lt;a href=\"Morrowind\"&gt;Morrowind&lt;/a&gt;. They planned to communicate their findings by letters sent through couriers.\n&lt;a href=\"Charwich-Koniinge%20Letters%2C%20v1\"&gt;Charwich's first letter&lt;/a&gt; stated that he had found information that Neithwyr had a mysterious patron named &lt;a href=\"Baliasir\"&gt;Baliasir&lt;/a&gt;, a fact he had learned at a cemetery with a gravestone of Neithwyr's sister &lt;a href=\"Peryra\"&gt;Peryra&lt;/a&gt; and a &lt;a href=\"Werewolf\"&gt;lycanthropic caretaker&lt;/a&gt;. Koniinge replied back that he could find nothing about Baliasir, but believed that Neithwyr had returned to High Rock with Peryra after getting the Star. Charwich's last letter was a written on his deathbed, having sustained mortal wounds from his battle with Baliasir, who it seemed had been a mighty daedra lord.\nKoniinge grieved for his friend, and traveled the span of the Empire to &lt;a href=\"Wayrest\"&gt;Wayrest&lt;/a&gt;, to pay his call of condolences on Lady &lt;a href=\"Moorling\"&gt;Moorling&lt;/a&gt;, the woman at whose house Charwich had been staying. After making some inquiries, Koniinge learned that her ladyship had left the city, quite suddenly. She had been entertaining a guest named Charwich, and it was understood that he had died, though no one ever saw the body. Certainly no healers had been sent to her house on the 13th of Last Seed of &lt;a href=\"3E%20411\"&gt;last year&lt;/a&gt;. And no one in Wayrest, just like no one in &lt;a href=\"Tel%20Aruhn%20%28Morrowind%29\"&gt;Tel Aruhn&lt;/a&gt;, had ever heard of Baliasir.\nPoor Koniinge was suddenly unsure of everything. He retraced his late partner's path through &lt;a href=\"Boriane\"&gt;Boriane&lt;/a&gt; and Grimtry Gardens, but found that the Neithwyr family crypt was elsewhere, in a small town in the &lt;a href=\"Dwynnen\"&gt;barony of Dwynnen&lt;/a&gt;. There was indeed a lycanthropic caretaker, fortunately in human form at the time. When questioned (using the technique of strangulation, release, strangulation, release), he told Koniinge the story that he had told Charwich many months before.\nHadwaf and Peryra Neithwyr had returned to Dwynnen, intent on settling old business. As the Star requires potent spirits for power, they thought they would begin small by capturing the spirit of the werewolf they knew of in the family graveyard. Sadly, for them, their grasp exceeded their reach. When the poor caretaker resumed his human form one morning, he found himself lying next to the shredded, bloody bodies of the Neithwyr siblings. Distressed and fearful, he brought the corpses and all their possessions down into the crypt. They were still there when Charwich came, and so too was Azura's Star.\nKoniinge now saw things clearly. The letters he had received from Charwich were lies, intended to keep him away. Undoubtedly with the assistance of Lady Moorling, his new partner, he had concocted stories, including one of his own demise, to trick Koniinge into abandoning the quest for the Star. It was clearly a sad statement on the nature of friendship, and one that needed immediate correction.\nIt took the better part of six months for Koniinge to find his old partner. Charwich and Lady Moorling had used the power of the Star to make themselves very wealthy and powerful. They assumed a number of different identities in their travels through High Rock and &lt;a href=\"Skyrim\"&gt;Skyrim&lt;/a&gt;, and then down to &lt;a href=\"Valenwood\"&gt;Valenwood&lt;/a&gt; and the Summurset Isle. Along the way, of course, the Star itself disappeared, as great &lt;a href=\"daedric%20artifacts\"&gt;daedric artifacts&lt;/a&gt; always do. The couple still had much wealth, but their love sadly fell on troubled times. When they reached &lt;a href=\"Alinor\"&gt;Alinor&lt;/a&gt;, they parted ways.\nOne must assume that during their months together, Charwich must have told Lady Moorling about Koniinge. It's pleasant to think of the loving couple laughing over the stories they were telling him about the mythical and dangerous Baliasir. Charwich must not have given his former beloved a very accurate physical description, however, because when Lady Moorling (then under the identity of the Countess &lt;a href=\"Zyliana\"&gt;Zyliana&lt;/a&gt;) met Koniinge, she had no idea who he was. It came as quite a surprise to her when he began strangling her and requesting information about her former paramour.\nBefore she died, she told Koniinge what Charwich's new name and title was, and where he was looking for a new palace. She even told him about me. Given all the twists and bends the last months' chase took him on, it was not difficult to find which palace Charwich was looking to buy, and what time his appointment was to view it. Then he had merely to arrive early, dispose of me, and wait.\nThere our story must sadly end. I look forward to seeing you soon.\nYours,\nSyrix Goinithi,\nFormer Estate Banker\nP.S.: Charwich\u2014Turn around now, or don't. Your choice. Your friend, Koniinge."}

{"id": "168219", "revid": "17401442", "url": "https://elderscrolls.fandom.com/wiki?curid=168219", "title": "Chasing Echoes", "text": "Chasing Echoes is a &lt;a href=\"Quests%20%28Dawnguard%29\"&gt;quest&lt;/a&gt; in .\nBackground.\n\"Serana has indicated her desire to locate her estranged mother, Valerica, who has fled Castle Volkihar with one of the Elder Scrolls. She believes that Valerica may have left a clue to her whereabouts somewhere in the courtyard of the castle. In order to avoid detection by the castle's vampires, she's decided to utilize a hidden entrance on the back side of the island.\"\nSpeak to &lt;a href=\"Serana\"&gt;Serana&lt;/a&gt; and ask her what's on her mind. She believes she knows where to start looking for one of the missing &lt;a href=\"Elder%20Scroll%20%28Lore%29\"&gt;Elder Scrolls&lt;/a&gt; that &lt;a href=\"Dexion%20Evicus\"&gt;Dexion&lt;/a&gt; mentioned.\nShe believes her mother, &lt;a href=\"Valerica\"&gt;Valerica&lt;/a&gt;, will know the whereabouts of the Elder Scroll, but she has no idea where she is. The last time Serana saw her, she told her she would go someplace safe where &lt;a href=\"Harkon\"&gt;Harkon&lt;/a&gt; would never find her. Serana cannot imagine where this could be, however through some additional dialogue Serana deduces that Valerica is hiding within &lt;a href=\"Castle%20Volkihar\"&gt;Castle Volkihar&lt;/a&gt; itself.\nWalkthrough.\nCastle Volkihar can be infiltrated via an unused dock on the north-western side of the island. To get there, the player can either climb over the rocky terrain to the dock or swim round. The platform is guarded by several armored &lt;a href=\"Skeleton%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;skeletons&lt;/a&gt;. After defeating the skeletons, proceed into the undercroft.\nCastle Undercroft.\nThe undercroft is guarded by &lt;a href=\"Death%20Hound%20%28Dawnguard%29\"&gt;Death Hounds&lt;/a&gt;, armored skeletons, and a &lt;a href=\"Feral%20Vampire\"&gt;Feral Vampire&lt;/a&gt; who has been banished to live here. Her \"&lt;a href=\"Journal%20Fragment\"&gt;Journal Fragment&lt;/a&gt;\" gives a little more insight. Fighting through the enemies leads to a canal with a raised wooden bridge. Before pulling the lever, there is a &lt;a href=\"Destruction%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Destruction&lt;/a&gt;\u00a0skill book \"&lt;a href=\"A%20Hypothetical%20Treachery\"&gt;A Hypothetical Treachery&lt;/a&gt;\" as well as the book \"&lt;a href=\"The%20Aetherium%20Wars\"&gt;The Aetherium Wars&lt;/a&gt;\" on the nearby table. Serana will comment that her father installed various security measures throughout the castle for her own safety. To lower the bridge proceed to the left and up the stairs, where there is a semi-hidden adept level &lt;a href=\"Containers%20%28Skyrim%29%23Chest\"&gt;chest&lt;/a&gt;, with random loot behind the spiderweb on the right. Proceed forward, where the lever is guarded by a &lt;a href=\"giant%20frostbite%20spider\"&gt;giant frostbite spider&lt;/a&gt;. Once the lever has been pulled, go through the door, and straight across there will be another platform with a skeleton on the ground. Jump up the pile of bones in the corner, onto the narrow ledge to the right, then onto the area with the chest and skeleton. Alternatively, use the\u00a0&lt;a href=\"Whirlwind%20Sprint\"&gt;Whirlwind Sprint&lt;/a&gt; (two words required) shout or the &lt;a href=\"Vampire%20Lord%23Bats\"&gt;Bats&lt;/a&gt; Night Power, to get across onto the platform; once there, to the left there will be a chest with random loot. Then return to the bridge that will lead to the courtyard.\nCourtyard.\nThe courtyard garden lies in a decrepit state and Serana comments that her mother would never have allowed it to fall into such disrepair.\nSerana: \"\"We've made it to the courtyard. Oh no... What happened to this place? Everything's been torn down... the whole place looks... well, dead. It's like we're the first to set foot here in centuries.\"\"This used to lead into the castle's great hall. It looks like my father had it sealed up. I used to walk through here after evening meals. It was beautiful, once.\"\"This was my mother's garden. It... do you know how beautiful something can be when it's tended by a master for hundreds of years? She would have hated to see it like this. Wait...\"\"Something's wrong with the moondial here. Some of the crests are missing and the dial is askew. I didn't even know the crests could be removed. Maybe my mother's trying to tell us something?\"\"\nIn the center of the courtyard is a moondial with various phases on the moon depicted around it. Serana mentions that there are some pieces missing. The three missing pieces can be found scattered around the courtyard:\nOnce all the pieces are placed around the moondial, it will rotate and a secret stairway entrance to the Castle Volkihar Ruins will be revealed.\nCastle Volkihar Ruins.\nThis part of the castle is blocked off from the rest. It's in a dilapidated state and is teeming with armed skeletons and &lt;a href=\"Gargoyle%20%28Dawnguard%29\"&gt;gargoyles&lt;/a&gt; bursting out from gargoyle statues. Head up the stairs into a dining room where several skeletons will be seated around the table. They will awaken when approached. Once they are defeated, head south up the balcony into a room filled with cobwebs and spiked traps. At the far end of this room the gargoyle statue comes to life and attacks. Once the gargoyle is eliminated, head into the next room to encounter two more skeletons; once they have been dealt with, off to the left will be an adept level door with some lockpicks, gold and gems. Continue up the long flight of stairs, where there will be another gargoyle who will attack.\nHead up some more sets of stairs, to find another adept level locked door, once picking the lock to the right will be a chest with random loot inside. Proceed up the stairs, and past several armed skeletons where you will come across another smaller dining area. There will be a medium size room with a gargoyle by the back wall. Behind the statue is a chain that needs to be pulled to open the iron gate to the next area. Once the chain is pulled, the gargoyle will attack. Head through the iron gate and up long flight of stairs where yet another armed skeleton and gargoyle are hostile.\nThe next choice is to either pull the chain to raise the iron gate into the next area or pick the expert level lock on the nearby door. Either option will lead to the same point, but the door is a shortcut that also gives the option of fighting the next set of enemies in a more controlled manner, rather than all at once. The door also leads to a small armory where a selection of &lt;a href=\"Ancient%20Nord%20Weapons\"&gt;Ancient Nord weapons&lt;/a&gt;, and a few enchanted weapons can be taken. Choosing the iron gate route will lead to a run-down cathedral of sorts. A raised platform is found at the far end where a leveled chest can be found to the left of a ruined statue of &lt;a href=\"Mara\"&gt;Mara&lt;/a&gt;\u00a0which is against the back wall suggesting that this area of the castle once was a temple of Mara.\nHead through the halls and over the bridge suspended above the cathedral to the next area. This next room is fairly sparse with the exception of the &lt;a href=\"Vampire%20Royal%20Armor\"&gt;Vampire Royal Armor&lt;/a&gt; that is on a shelf to the right, next to two coffins. In addition, there are several Gargoyle statues that will attack when approached.\nThe room will seem to be a dead end, but Serana will comment that there should be a secret entrance somewhere nearby. The entrance can be found by turning a candlestick on the back wall, on the left-hand side of the fireplace. Following the hallway leads eventually to Valerica's Study.\nValerica's Study.\nSerana: \"\"Look at the place. This has to be it! I know she was deep into necromancy. I mean, she taught me everything I know. But I had no idea she had a setup like this.\"\"Look at all this. She must have spent years collecting these components. And what's this thing? I'm not sure about this circle, but it's obviously... something. Let's take a look around. There has to be something here that tells us where she's gone.\"\"My mother was meticulous about her research. If we can find her notes, there might be some hints in there.\"\"\nThe most prominent feature in the study is the large group of circular stone rings in the center of the room. Serana asks the Dragonborn to locate \"&lt;a href=\"Valerica%27s%20Journal\"&gt;Valerica's Journal&lt;/a&gt;\" to give any insight into her whereabouts. The journal can be found on the bookshelf to the right among several other books.\nAfter reading it, Serana mentions that three ingredients are required to open a portal to the &lt;a href=\"Soul%20Cairn%20%28Dawnguard%29\"&gt;Soul Cairn&lt;/a&gt;. These can all be found within the well-stocked laboratory.\nOnce all the ingredients have been found, place them in the chalice overlooking the stone dial. Serana will add her own blood to the mixture in place of Valerica's and the circular stone rings in the center of the room will begin to rotate, eventually revealing the portal.\nThe Choice.\nProceed towards the newly opened portal. If the Dragonborn is not a vampire, the portal will begin to leech some health. Serana comments that this is because the conditions to enter the portal are such that there are only two options."}

Inside &lt;a href=\"Vachel%27s%20House\"&gt;Vachel's House&lt;/a&gt;, the Vestige will find a suspicious abandoned cellar.\n&lt;a href=\"Okeeh\"&gt;Okeeh&lt;/a&gt;, who can be found south of the &lt;a href=\"Davon%27s%20Watch%20Fighters%20Guild\"&gt;Fighters Guild&lt;/a&gt;, has noticed an out-of-towner in the abandoned stables. &lt;a href=\"Feduria%20Llaren\"&gt;Feduria Llaren&lt;/a&gt;, who is usually in the &lt;a href=\"Davon%27s%20Watch%20Market%20District\"&gt;market district&lt;/a&gt;, recalls an Imperial who pushed her while she was haggling at the market. He then went to the east end of town. Further investigation will lead the Vestige to a mysterious cellar in the abandoned stable behind the blacksmith building, &lt;a href=\"Avani%20Bladeworks\"&gt;Avani Bladeworks&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe Worm's Retreat.\nInside the cellar are multiple &lt;a href=\"Skeletal%20Warrior%20%28Online%29\"&gt;skeletal warriors&lt;/a&gt;.

Because Abnur will not recognize the Vestige, one can choose to persuade him or simply ask who he is. If asked about Sai Sahan, he will respond that he knows his location, but will refuse to reveal it.\nIf the persuasion attempt on Abnur fails, &lt;a href=\"Severinus%20Falco\"&gt;Severinus Falco&lt;/a&gt; will arrive and attack the Vestige. Afterward, the Orb must be taken to the Prophet, who will use it to find Sai Sahan. Once this is done, Lyris will talk to the Vestige, saying that Abnur Tharn can be persuaded to leave the Worm Cult. She will then reward the Vestige, and the quest will be completed."}

However, all the three guest rooms are occupied, and two guests are cannibals. The correct guest is the man that asks for room service. Next, the Vestige must find their way through a dark maze. Finally, they must fight their way through &lt;a href=\"Madman%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Madmen&lt;/a&gt; and Madwomen to a boss fight with &lt;a href=\"Uncle%20Leo%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Uncle Leo&lt;/a&gt;, a &lt;a href=\"Flesh%20Atronach%20%28Online%29\"&gt;flesh atronach&lt;/a&gt;.\nBackground.\n\"I've been tasked with finding another book for the Mages Guild. Once again I need to return to the Shivering Isles, to a place called the Chateau of the Ravenous Rodent.\"\nWalkthrough.\nOnce you hit the appropriate level (player level 33, Mage Guild level 4) you will receive this quest from &lt;a href=\"Arch-Mage%20Shalidor\"&gt;Arch-Mage Shalidor&lt;/a&gt;. Speak to him and the following conversation will occur:\n\"Adept. We need your support once again. Valaste has translated the book you earned in Sheogorath's mad play.\"\nAfter that, head inside the Mages Guild. Once there, look for the Portal to the Shivering Isles. After talking with Valaste, she will open the portal.\n\"Shalidor found you, excellent. I've puzzled out the hints from that last book ... and I'm afraid the news isn't good. Your next trial is in a particularly nasty part of the Shivering Isles. A place called the Chateau of the Ravenous Rodent.\"\nTalking to Valaste before entering the portal will have her say the following:\n\"Uhh ... Xarxes give me strength. I'm alright, adept. I just didn't realize how tired I am.\"\nAfter hearing what Valaste has to say, enter the portal and find Shalidor. The following conversation will occur.\n\"Welcome back to the Isles, adept. We must be wary. This part of Sheogorath's realm is twisted and corrupt.\"\nJust as you finish talking, &lt;a href=\"Sheogorath%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Sheogorath&lt;/a&gt; will make his appearance.\nSheogorath: \"Not so fast there, Shalidor. Only invited guests at the Chateau. We have standards, you know.\"\nShalidor: \"Damn you, Mad God!\"\nSheogorath: \"Don't let the door hit you on the way out, Shally. Annnnd... off you go!\"\nJust as Sheogorath finishes talking to Shalidor, he makes him disappear, turning to the Vestige to talk.\n\"Just the two of us. Now we can talk in peace.\"\n\"Ahh, my little mortal. I'm a man of many personalities, but I tell you what? They're all very fond of you.\"\nAfter the brief dialogue with Sheogorath, he will disappear, and you will have to enter inside the &lt;a href=\"Chateau%20of%20the%20Ravenous%20Rodent%20%28Location%29\"&gt;Chateau guesthouse&lt;/a&gt;. Right after doing so, the following can be heard:\nShalidor: \"Be wary. Talk to these 'guests' carefully before you try to throw anyone out.\"\nSheogorath: \"I can hear you, Shally! Don't bother my guests!\"\nShalidor: \"You're the only one that thinks you're funny, Mad God!\"\nYou have to find the guest that does not belong, after hearing what each one has to say. The guest behind the first door will complain about the skittering noise. When she hears about an eviction she will start rambling, claiming that she prefers to stay inside and away from the gaze of others. Choosing to evict the first one, a Madwoman will exit the room and attack you.\n\"Hello? is someone there? I can hear you moving!\"\nThe man behind the second door, unlike the madwoman, seems eager to leave the room and becomes very aggressive once informed about the eviction. Choosing to open this door will have the madman burst out and attack you.\n\"I can hear someone out there! Hello?\"\nWhen, talking to the man behind the third door you will quickly discover that he is not the one fitting in and should be evicted, as he does not appear as insane as the other two. When you inform him of the eviction, his response is the most logical out of the three, saying that if he is thrown out, he will drag the Vestige to court.\n\"Hello? Is someone there? I sent for room service hours ago.\"\nAfter he is kicked out he will storm out of the room.\nNoble: \"Fine then! My advocate will be contacting you about this! I'll show myself out. But I'm not taking that dreadful portal!\"\nSheogorath: \"That's a perfectly good portal. I should know, I made it!\"\nAfter that short exchange, enter the portal and talk to Sheogorath.\n\"It's been so long since we had guests. You would have loved my old uncle Leo, back in the day. Charming dinner conversation, when he wasn't bringing up old girlfriends. Literally. Regurgitating them. Nasty habit.\"\nSheogorath will then disappear and leave you to light the braziers. Enemies called &lt;a href=\"Bump%20in%20the%20Night\"&gt;Bump in the Night&lt;/a&gt; can be found scattered throughout the maze, making the task harder than it would seem. As soon as Sheogorath leaves you to complete your objective, Shalidor will interfere trying to advise you.\nShalidor: \"You've faced darkness before, adept. Remember your training.\"\nSheogorath: \"No cheating, Shalidor! Don't ruin this for me.\"\nAfter lighting the second brazier player can hear the following dialogue:\nShalidor: \"Only two more to go. This trial is child's play.\"\nSheogorath: \"I'm going to bind you to haunt a little old lady in Wayrest! Does that sound fun, Shally?\"\nAfter lighting all four braziers, find the exit and then talk to Sheogorath.\n\"So ... what did you think? What was your favorite part? No, don't answer that. I can see by the look on your face how happy you are!\"\nAfter finishing his talk, Sheogorath will again disappear. Following that, enter the manse. As soon as you go inside the first room, the following exchange can be heard between Shalidor and Sheogorath.\nShalidor: \"Those poor souls. Sheogorath's family'\"\nSheogorath: \"How do you keep getting back in here? I blame Haskill.\"\nShalidor: \"Apparently, not everything is under your control!\"\nSheogorath: \"Not yet, anyway.\"\nExplore the manse crawling with &lt;a href=\"Madman%20%28Online%29\"&gt;madmen&lt;/a&gt; and madwomen, and light all the heirlooms in the correct order. To solve the light puzzle from left (1) to right (4), the correct order of the heirlooms is 1, 4, 2, 3, 1. After that, talk to Sheogorath.\n\"Isn't it beautiful? The most beautiful part of the chateau. You can see why I've held onto the place all these years.\"\nSheogorath will disappear again after the talk with him finishes. After that, enter the Master Bedroom, where Uncle Shep can be found. When he is killed, talk to Sheogorath.\n\"Well done! The family would be so proud, if you hadn't already murdered most of them.\"\n\"Always sad to see a good man die. Leo's death, just now? Hilarious! Hah.\"\n\"Give Valaste my best!\"\nAfter you collect the tome, talk to Valaste.\n\"You'be returned! Do you have the book?\"\n\"Wish me luck, my friend. I'll need it, this time around.\""}

{"id": "53888", "revid": "3253409", "url": "https://elderscrolls.fandom.com/wiki?curid=53888", "title": "Chaurus (Skyrim)", "text": "The Chaurus is a hostile &lt;a href=\"insect\"&gt;insect&lt;/a&gt; found in .\nOverview.\nChaurus are large, venomous insects that live deep in the lightless caverns and chasms beneath &lt;a href=\"Skyrim\"&gt;Skyrim&lt;/a&gt;. They have been domesticated by the\u00a0&lt;a href=\"Falmer%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Falmer&lt;/a&gt;, and often live and fight alongside their\u00a0masters. One should be sure to improve one's resistance to &lt;a href=\"Poison%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;poison&lt;/a&gt; with abilities, potions, or enchantments when facing them. They drop small valuables such as\u00a0, a &lt;a href=\"Precious%20Gems%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;gem&lt;/a&gt;, or a &lt;a href=\"Rings%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;ring&lt;/a&gt;.\nFor ranged attacks, the chaurus projects a stream of poison that drains health for five seconds. Using sharp pincers for melee attacks, the chaurus will repeatedly poison and slash its prey. In groups, the multiple poison attacks stack and can drain health in seconds. Regular chaurus require time between spitting poison attacks, however hunters can spew poison almost continuously.\nThere are four main varieties of chaurus: standard, &lt;a href=\"Chaurus%20Reaper%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Chaurus Reaper&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Chaurus%20Hunter%20Fledgling\"&gt;Chaurus Hunter Fledgling&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Chaurus%20Hunter%20%28Dawnguard%29\"&gt;Chaurus Hunter&lt;/a&gt;. The latter two are implemented by the add-on . Deep underground, in certain areas, Chaurus Reapers grow to be unusually large. These larger chaurus reapers are fast in movement but not very agile, yet still may be difficult to kill. The Chaurus makes a unique clacking sound to communicate, so if this noise is heard, there is a chaurus ready to strike.\nWhile the hunter variant's existence in Skyrim is dependent on having installed, it is not limited to spawning in areas exclusive to the add-on. Any area that has any chaurus spawn may have hunters spawn instead so long as the &lt;a href=\"Last%20Dragonborn\"&gt;Dragonborn&lt;/a&gt; is of sufficient level. The decaying corpses of chaurus may be found in caves, which will spew a harmless green liquid when destroyed. Occasionally, they may instead burst open and a Chaurus Hunter Fledgling emerges when approached.\nChaurus are similar to flies and caterpillars in that they have several stages of growth: from an egg, a chaurus will hatch and begin growing. Then, after an unknown amount of time, the chaurus will begin to die; they will then cover themselves with a thick resin to create a chrysalis. From there, the chaurus transforms into a hunter fledgling. In other cases, the chaurus will keep growing and become a chaurus reaper, and will then start to lay eggs in a nest.\nLoot.\nPods in a chaurus nest may be harvested for &lt;a href=\"Chaurus%20Eggs\"&gt;Chaurus Eggs&lt;/a&gt;, an &lt;a href=\"Ingredients%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;ingredient&lt;/a&gt; used in &lt;a href=\"Alchemy%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Alchemy&lt;/a&gt;. A dead chaurus may provide &lt;a href=\"Chaurus%20Chitin\"&gt;Chaurus Chitin&lt;/a&gt;, a material used to improve &lt;a href=\"Falmer%20weapons\"&gt;Falmer weapons&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Falmer%20Armor\"&gt;armor&lt;/a&gt;, and occasionally a few chaurus eggs. Though chaurus chitin may be used to improve Falmer armor, one cannot create any. Chaurus hunters will instead drop one of their &lt;a href=\"Chaurus%20Hunter%20Antennae\"&gt;antennae&lt;/a&gt;, an alchemical ingredient. A chaurus may also drop minor loot."}

Maybe you recall meals shared with family and friends, favorite dishes in the cold of winter, or a simple snack in the shade of a tree while traveling. I am here to tell you how much more there is to cheese than you ever realized. Join me on a journey across &lt;a href=\"Tamriel\"&gt;Tamriel&lt;/a&gt; and discover a breadth of culinary experience you've never imagined!\nLet's start simple. &lt;a href=\"Eidar%20Cheese%20Wedge%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Eidar cheese&lt;/a&gt;, popular in &lt;a href=\"Skyrim%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Skyrim&lt;/a&gt;, is eaten by the &lt;a href=\"Nords%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Nords&lt;/a&gt; alongside hearty spit-roasted meats. They do not share the refined approach to cuisine that we &lt;a href=\"Bretons%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Bretons&lt;/a&gt; take, but I have discovered that Eidar's rich, earthy flavor and creamy texture are quite conducive to sauces. Try it with poultry dishes or paired with a young Collequiva!\nFor a more exotic taste from Skyrim, you must seek out cheese made from the milk of &lt;a href=\"Mammoth%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;mammoths&lt;/a&gt;. Only the truly brave can obtain it from the &lt;a href=\"Giant%20%28Online%29\"&gt;giants&lt;/a&gt; who craft it (Yes, giants! Who did you think could milk a mammoth?), but its restorative potential and robust flavor make it well-worth a bit of risk. I've heard it called an acquired taste, but you'll be amazed at how it completes a hearty stew.\nAs a student of Breton culinary tradition, I cannot rightly count it among the true cheeses, but &lt;a href=\"Scuttle\"&gt;Scuttle&lt;/a&gt; bears mention for the adventurous. This delicious treat is crafted from\u2014don't balk!\u2014the flesh of beetles native to &lt;a href=\"Morrowind%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Morrowind&lt;/a&gt;. Do not let its composition or greasy texture turn you away, for its peppery, complex richness is loved by the &lt;a href=\"Dunmer%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Dark Elves&lt;/a&gt; for good reason.\nFor an energizing snack, you must try &lt;a href=\"Elsweyr%20Fondue%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Elsweyr Fondue&lt;/a&gt;. There are countless variants of this dish, but the basics are always the same: a good cheese, strong ale, and, of course, &lt;a href=\"Moon%20Sugar%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Moon Sugar&lt;/a&gt;. Keep your pot on a low flame and be careful not to overdo the &lt;a href=\"ale\"&gt;ale&lt;/a&gt;. The best part is experimenting to find your favorite combination of ingredients and dipping foods. My advice: try adding a different herb every time!\nOn the subject of melting, the &lt;a href=\"Redguards%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Redguards&lt;/a&gt;\u00a0craft a cheese with an unusual quirk. They keep the secrets of its culturing process close to heart, but love to surprise foreign guests by serving it. It is known as &lt;a href=\"Shrieking%20Cheese\"&gt;Shrieking Cheese&lt;/a&gt;. When it is melted to a certain point, it actually lets loose a jarring scream! In a common dish, small blocks of the cheese are added atop spicy meat as it cooks in an open pot. When it shrieks, it's ready!\nAnother rare treat, should you ever be fortunate enough to find it, is the legendarily aromatic &lt;a href=\"Olroy%20Cheese\"&gt;Olroy cheese&lt;/a&gt;. To give you just the slightest idea of how wonderful this cheese is: I do not exaggerate when I say a scent of it alone was worth the many false leads and months of traipsing across southern &lt;a href=\"Cyrodiil%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Cyrodiil&lt;/a&gt; in search of it.\nLook at all these cheeses, in wheels, wedges, and slices! So many, and it's only the beginning, there are even more cheeses out there just waiting for you. Even if you can't make long journeys in search of these delicious creations, I hope that reading about them encourages you to try as many cheeses as you can find."}

Unlike most master chefs of the higher kitchens, Toel wasn't born to it. He started down working on the lower kitchens, and he made whatever was necessary to be promoted.\nPhysical appearance.\nToel was a Breton looking &lt;a href=\"Umbrielian\"&gt;Umbrielian&lt;/a&gt;. He had high, delicate cheekbones and sensuous lips. His chin was long, slim and manicured. His hair was black, and his eyes sky blue.\nHistory.\n&lt;a href=\"Umbriel%20Crisis\"&gt;Umbriel Crisis&lt;/a&gt;.\nAfter &lt;a href=\"Anna%C3%AFg\"&gt;Anna\u00efg&lt;/a&gt;'s success preparing &lt;a href=\"Lord%20Ghol\"&gt;Lord Ghol&lt;/a&gt; meals, Toel decided to invade &lt;a href=\"Qijne\"&gt;Qijne&lt;/a&gt;'s kitchen in order to kidnap Anna\u00efg. The invasion started with explosions and fire. Qijne, accompanied by her most trusted cookers, scorted Anna\u00efg to a safe room. However, a monster melted the valve and door of the room. Toel's men started to pour from the door. When Qijne realised it was all over, she decided to kill Anna\u00efg. She would have achieved her goal if &lt;a href=\"Slyr\"&gt;Slyr&lt;/a&gt; hadn't stopped her. Slyr nailed a knife in Qijne's neck, ending with her life.\nWhen the fight settled, Toel emerged from the warriors and presented to Anna\u00efg. He told Anna\u00efg not to fear him, from now on she would work for him.\nThe day after Anna\u00efg and Slyr were brought to Toel's kitchens, &lt;a href=\"Dulg\"&gt;Dulg&lt;/a&gt; informed Anna\u00efg she would breakfast with Lord Toel. She met Toel in his chambers. Toel asked her about how life was in &lt;a href=\"Tamriel\"&gt;Tamriel&lt;/a&gt;. Anna\u00efg explained that she grew up in &lt;a href=\"Lilmoth\"&gt;Lilmoth&lt;/a&gt;. She realised that Toel didn't know the word father meant, or that if a man and a woman procreate a baby is conceived. The &lt;a href=\"Umbrielian\"&gt;Umbrielians&lt;/a&gt; were born from the Marrow Sump. Toel was silent for the most part of the conversation, only asking when he didn't know what a word meant. Once she finished speaking, Toel tried to convince Anna\u00efg that she would never be able to return to Tamriel. Eventually, she would be as part of Umbriel as Toel or any other &lt;a href=\"Umbrielian\"&gt;Umbrielian&lt;/a&gt; was.\nToel was very satisfied by Anna\u00efg's work. He came to expect the very best of her. He met Anna\u00efg again in his chambers. He mentioned her that &lt;a href=\"Lord%20Irrel\"&gt;Lord Irrel&lt;/a&gt; was pleased by her meals. He also told her that she should make a decision: Slyr could stay with her, but if she decided to get rid of her, Anna\u00efg would directly work for her as his understudy. Toel was disappointed that Anna\u00efg decided not to betray Slyr. Finally, Toel implied that they would have intimate relations when she was ready for it.\nSlyr felt she was irrelevant in Toel's kitchen, and she started to distrust Anna\u00efg. One day, she asked Anna\u00efg to taste a dish she was preparing, but Slyr's intention was to poison her. When Anna\u00efg realised she had been poisoned, she searched for ingredients for an antidote. She drank the antidote just before fainting. She woke up in Toel's chambers. Toel asked her how she wanted to have Slyr executed. However, Anna\u00efg prayed Toel to let her live. The guards pushed Slyr inside the room. Toel ordered to clean her up to have intimate relations with him.\nToel asked Anna\u00efg to prepare some remorse out of horse brain for Lord Irrel's thirty-third course. Anna\u00efg doubted that a horse could feel remorse, so Toel decided to kill &lt;a href=\"Kohnu\"&gt;Kohnu&lt;/a&gt;, who had been wounded and wouldn't be able to cook for weeks.\nThe next time Toel invited Anna\u00efg to his chambers, he told her that he was disappointed with her for sparing Slyr's life after she had poisoned her. However, Toel still found Anna\u00efg and her creativity useful. Toel told her that &lt;a href=\"Phmer\"&gt;Phmer&lt;/a&gt;, Luuniel, Ashdre and him would compete in a tasting for &lt;a href=\"Lord%20Rhel\"&gt;Lord Rhel&lt;/a&gt;. He entrusted Anna\u00efg to find the ninth savor, a savor that had only been discovered by Phmer.\nAnna\u00efg finally concluded that Toel wanted to her to steal the savor from Phmer. The day after she suposedly stole the savor, Dulg informed Anna\u00efg that Toel required her presence. Phmer and her assistants were also waiting for her. Phmer accused Anna\u00efg of stealing the savor from her. Toel informed her that if she was found guilty, he would have to give her over to Phmer. However, Anna\u00efg had discovered the ninth savor on her own. She had also fooled Slyr to wear her dress with a vial full of the ninth savor. Everybody thought Slyr was the thief, and Toel allowed Phmer to take possession of Slyr. Phmer also asked Toel to let her interrogate Anna\u00efg. Yet, Toel refused her petition. After Phmer was gone, Toel was curious to know how Anna\u00efg had stolen the savor. Anna\u00efg explained him how she had reinvented the savor and tainted Slyr's dress with it. Before leaving, Toel tried to intimate with Anna\u00efg. Anna\u00efg kissed him, but she told him that she would so it in her own time.\nOnce the &lt;a href=\"skraws\"&gt;skraws&lt;/a&gt; started sabotaging the kitchens, Toel suspected of the other kitchens. He asked Anna\u00efg to develop a recipe to breathe underwater. Anna\u00efg, Toel and his guards went to the tunnels that conected the different kitchens. They discovered &lt;a href=\"Wert\"&gt;Wert&lt;/a&gt; with a nutrient injector. Toel thought that Phmer had turned the skraws against him. &lt;a href=\"Mere-Glim\"&gt;Mere-Glim&lt;/a&gt; had been following Toel through the tunnels, so when he saw that they were going to kill Wert, he attacked the guards. Glim had advantage underwater, so he easily beat Toel's men. Toel managed to make a cut in Glim's belly with his spear, but Glim stroke him in the face. A wounded Toel ordered Glim to let him go, but Glim refused to do so. Toel's eyes started to glow in a silver color. Glim's muscles started clenching uncontrollably and his fingers lost their grip. When Anna\u00efg saw what Toel was doing to Glim, she thrusted Toel with her invisible knife. The blade sliced cleanly through the joint of his elbow, ending with his life. Toel's body was hidden in Phmer's kitchen surroundings, to make it look like Toel was killed trying to invade Phmer\u2019s kitchen."}

It is written by &lt;a href=\"Livillus%20Perus\"&gt;Livillus Perus&lt;/a&gt;, an &lt;a href=\"Imperial%20University\"&gt;Imperial University&lt;/a&gt; professor who provides insight into medium armor worn by the &lt;a href=\"Khajiit\"&gt;Khajiit&lt;/a&gt; during the &lt;a href=\"Five%20Year%20War\"&gt;Five Year War&lt;/a&gt;.\nContents.\nContemporary with Maqamat Lusign (interviewed in volume seventeen of this series) is the &lt;a href=\"Khajit\"&gt;Khajit&lt;/a&gt;i Cherim, whose tapestries have been hailed as masterpieces all over the &lt;a href=\"Empire\"&gt;Empire&lt;/a&gt; for nigh on thirty years now. His four factories located throughout &lt;a href=\"Elsweyr\"&gt;Elsweyr&lt;/a&gt; make reproductions of his work, but his original tapestries command stellar prices. The &lt;a href=\"Uriel%20Septim%20VII\"&gt;Emperor&lt;/a&gt; himself owns ten Cherim tapestries, and his representatives are currently negotiating the sale of five more.\nThe muted use of color contrasted with the luminous skin tones of Cherim's subjects is a marked contrast with the old style of tapestry. The subjects of his work in recent years have been fabulous tales of the ancient past: the &lt;a href=\"Nine%20Divines\"&gt;Gods&lt;/a&gt; meeting to discuss the formation of the world; the &lt;a href=\"Chimer\"&gt;Chimer&lt;/a&gt; following the Prophet &lt;a href=\"Veloth\"&gt;Veloth&lt;/a&gt; into Morrowind; the &lt;a href=\"Wild%20Elves\"&gt;Wild Elves&lt;/a&gt; battling &lt;a href=\"Morihaus\"&gt;Morihaus&lt;/a&gt; and his legions at the &lt;a href=\"White-Gold%20Tower\"&gt;White-Gold Tower&lt;/a&gt;. His earliest designs dealt with more contemporary subjects. I had the opportunity to discuss with him one of his first masterpieces, The Heart of Anequina, at his villa in &lt;a href=\"Orcrest\"&gt;Orcrest&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe Heart of Anequina presents an historic battle of the &lt;a href=\"Five%20Year%20War\"&gt;Five Year War&lt;/a&gt; between Elsweyr and &lt;a href=\"Valenwood\"&gt;Valenwood&lt;/a&gt; which raged from &lt;a href=\"3E%20394\"&gt;3E 394&lt;/a&gt; (or\u00a0&lt;a href=\"3E%20395\"&gt;3E 395&lt;/a&gt;, depending on what one considers to be the beginning of the war) until &lt;a href=\"3E%20399\"&gt;3E 399&lt;/a&gt;. In most fair accounts, the war lasted 4 years and 9 months, but artistic license from the great epic poets added an additional three months to the ordeal.\nThe actual details of the battle itself, as interpreted by Cherim, are explicit. The faces of a hundred and twenty &lt;a href=\"Wood%20Elf\"&gt;Wood Elf&lt;/a&gt; archers can be differentiated one from the other, each registering fear at the approach of the Khajiti army. Their hauberks catch the dim light of the sun. The menacing shadows of the Elsweyr battlecats loom on the hills, every muscle strained, ready to pounce in command. It is not surprising that he got all the details right, because Cherim was in the midst of it, as a Khajiti foot soldier.\nEvery minute part of the Khajiti &lt;a href=\"Medium%20Armor\"&gt;medium-weight armor&lt;/a&gt; can be seen in the soldiers in the foreground. The embroidered edging and striped patterns on the tunics. Each lacquered plate on loose-fitting leather in the Elsweyr style. The helmets of cloth and fluted silver.\n\"Cherim does not understand the point of &lt;a href=\"Heavy%20Armor\"&gt;plate mail&lt;/a&gt;,\" said Cherim. \"It is hot, for one, like being both burned and buried alive. Cherim wore it at the insistence of our &lt;a href=\"Nord\"&gt;Nord&lt;/a&gt; advisors during the Battle of Zelinin, and Cherim couldn't even turn to see what my fellow Khajiit were doing. Cherim did some sketches for a tapestry of the &lt;a href=\"Battle%20of%20Zelinin\"&gt;Battle of Zelinin&lt;/a&gt;, but Cherim finds that to make it realistic, the figures came out very mechanical, like iron golems or dwemer centurions. Knowing our Khajiti commanders, Cherim would not be surprised if giving up the heavy plate was more aesthetic than practical.\"\n\"Elsweyr lost the Battle of Zelinin, didn't she?\"\n\"Yes, but Elsweyr won the war, starting at the next battle, the Heart of Anequina,\" said Cherim with a smile. \"The tide turned as soon as we Khajiit sent our Nordic advisors back to &lt;a href=\"Solitude\"&gt;Solitude&lt;/a&gt;. We had to get rid of all the heavy armor they brought to us and find enough traditional medium armor our troops felt comfortable wearing. Obviously, the principle advantage of the medium armor was that we could move easily in it, as you can see from the natural stances of the soldiers in the tapestry.\n\"Now if you look at this poor perforated &lt;a href=\"Cathay-raht\"&gt;Cathay-raht&lt;/a&gt; who just keeps battling on in the bottom background, you see the other advantage. It seems strange to say, but one of the best features of medium armor is that an arrow will either deflect completely or pass all the way through. An arrow head is like a hook, made to stick where it strikes if it doesn't pass through. A soldier in medium armor will find himself with a hole in his body and the bolt on the other side. Our healers can fix such a wound easily if it isn't fatal, but if the arrow still remains in the armor, as it does with heavier armor, the wound will be reopened every time the fellow moves. Unless the Khajiit strips off the armor and pulls out the arrow, which is what we had to do at the Battle of Zelinin. A difficult and time-consuming process in the heat of battle, to say the least.\"\nI asked him next, \"Is there a self portrait in the battle?\"\n\"Yes,\" Cherim said with another grin. \"You see the small figure of the Khajiit stealing the rings off the dead Wood Elf? His back is facing you, but he has a brown and orange striped tail like Cherim's. Cherim does not say that all stereotypes about the Khajiit are fair, but Cherim must sometimes acknowledge them.\"\nA self-deprecating style in self-portraiture is also evident in the tapestries of Ranulf Hook, the next artist interviewed in volume nineteen of this series."}

This is not a purchase for the faint of heart! There's all types of tales on the origins of such a piece, but little is known. What we are sure of? This is a heavily cursed item!\nListen close, ladies and gents, listen close. You hear that? A soft moaning, muffled. That's no parlor trick! I haven't stuffed an assistant in there, if that's what you think. No, the Chest of Condemnation always cries out, though no one knows why. What lies inside? Another mystery, I'm afraid. Though perhaps you'll be the deft hand to break its seal. Wouldn't recommend it though, if I were you.\nBut that's not it's true curse, oh no. A bit of groaning and moaning, well, what's the harm in that? But after awhile, well, it tends to drive folks a bit nutty. They say all the previous owners of this chest turned plum mad after awhile. We here tend to keep it under lock and key, far away from any ears. You'll most likely want to do the same.\nNow, let's start the bidding at, shall we say, 50,000 gold pieces?"}

Cheydinhal is the cultural center of the &lt;a href=\"Dark%20Elves\"&gt;Dark Elves&lt;/a&gt; in the Imperial Province, with architecture influenced by &lt;a href=\"Morrowind\"&gt;Morrowind&lt;/a&gt;. Many Dunmer live in Cheydinhal because of the city's proximity to their homeland.\nDescription.\nGeography.\nCheydinhal is a walled-off city situated on the foothills of the &lt;a href=\"Valus%20Mountains\"&gt;Valus Mountains&lt;/a&gt; and on the Cyrodilic end of the &lt;a href=\"Blue%20Road\"&gt;Blue Road&lt;/a&gt; that runs towards &lt;a href=\"Morrowind\"&gt;Morrowind&lt;/a&gt;. Cheydinhal is built around a tributary of the &lt;a href=\"Corbolo%20River\"&gt;Corbolo River&lt;/a&gt;, which is due south of the city. \nCheydinhal consists of three distinct districts. To the north is &lt;a href=\"Castle%20Cheydinhal\"&gt;Castle Cheydinhal&lt;/a&gt;, which is comprised of an inner courtyard, an open park, and a road leading up to the castle. To the west is the Market District, which contains the Western Gate towards Cyrodiil. The Blue Road runs through the main street of the Market District, which then continues over a bridge that leads to the Eastern Gate and from there, towards Morrowind. Another road goes south from the main street, where it leads to the local &lt;a href=\"Fighters%20Guild\"&gt;Fighters Guild&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Mages%20Guild\"&gt;Mages Guild&lt;/a&gt;, and a few stores. The lower Corbolo tributary has a small island on it. The island hosts festivals and other activities. The eastern area is known as the Chapel District, which connects to the Market through bridges over the river. Most of the residential homes are located here, as well as the &lt;a href=\"Great%20Chapel%20of%20Arkay\"&gt;Great Chapel of Arkay&lt;/a&gt;. Hidden away here is the &lt;a href=\"Cheydinhal%20Sanctuary\"&gt;Cheydinhal Sanctuary&lt;/a&gt; of the &lt;a href=\"Dark%20Brotherhood\"&gt;Dark Brotherhood&lt;/a&gt;.\nHistory.\n&lt;a href=\"First%20Era\"&gt;First Era&lt;/a&gt;.\nGreat House Tharn.\nIn the aftermath of the &lt;a href=\"War%20of%20Righteousness\"&gt;War of Righteousness&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Turpis%20Tharn\"&gt;Turpis Tharn&lt;/a&gt; became the Earl of Outer Cheydinhal and acquired the family holdings in the city-state. Turpis would go on to marry the niece of &lt;a href=\"Bendu%20Olo\"&gt;Bendu Olo&lt;/a&gt; of the &lt;a href=\"All%20Flags%20Navy\"&gt;All Flags Navy&lt;/a&gt;, further establishing House Tharn's presence in the Imperial Province. As time went on, House Tharn had a significant presence in the &lt;a href=\"Imperial%20City\"&gt;Imperial City&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Elder%20Council\"&gt;Elder Council&lt;/a&gt;, with &lt;a href=\"Regulus%20Tharn\"&gt;Regulus Tharn&lt;/a&gt; bringing back the tradition of Imperial Battlemages and &lt;a href=\"Excoraeus%20Tharn\"&gt;Excoraeus Tharn&lt;/a&gt; being &lt;a href=\"Emperor%20Kastav\"&gt;Emperor Kastav&lt;/a&gt;'s Minister of Punition.\n&lt;a href=\"Second%20Era\"&gt;Second Era&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe Cheydinhal Rebellion.\nDuring the &lt;a href=\"Interregnum\"&gt;Interregnum&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"2E%20582\"&gt;2E 582&lt;/a&gt;, the city-state of Cheydinhal was in ruin. During the time of the &lt;a href=\"Alliance%20War\"&gt;Alliance War&lt;/a&gt;, Central Cyrodiil become the battlefield of the conflict. Cheydinhal was situated in what was considered the territory of the &lt;a href=\"Ebonheart%20Pact\"&gt;Ebonheart Pact&lt;/a&gt;, and so soldiers of the Alliance would frequent the city ruins. The occupation of the city was divided at this time, with the Imperial Legion occupying the Chapel District and the citizens controlling the Market District. &lt;a href=\"Sylvian%20Herius\"&gt;Sylvian Herius&lt;/a&gt; was the de facto leader of the Cheydinhal rebellion, leading the people as they were fighting the Legion. &lt;a href=\"Vestige\"&gt;Wayfarers&lt;/a&gt; of the Alliance War traveled to Cheydinhal, aiding the rebellion in their fight for the city. The outcome of the conflict is unknown.\n&lt;a href=\"Third%20Era\"&gt;Third Era&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe Dunmeri Migration.\nDuring the &lt;a href=\"Oblivion%20Crisis\"&gt;Oblivion Crisis&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"3E%20433\"&gt;3E 433&lt;/a&gt;, the city-state of Cheydinhal was ruled by &lt;a href=\"Andel%20Indarys\"&gt;Andel Indarys&lt;/a&gt;, who was a &lt;a href=\"Dunmer\"&gt;Dunmer&lt;/a&gt;i immigrant of the Great &lt;a href=\"House%20Hlaalu\"&gt;House Hlaalu&lt;/a&gt; who fled the theocracy of the &lt;a href=\"Tribunal%20Temple\"&gt;Tribunal Temple&lt;/a&gt; sometime before the death of &lt;a href=\"Almalexia\"&gt;Almalexia&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;a href=\"Clockwork%20City\"&gt;Clockwork City&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"3E%20427\"&gt;3E 427&lt;/a&gt;. Indarys' sudden rise to power has left many scholars without an answer, and the old families of Cyrodiil refer to him as a presumptuous upstart. The Count's wife, &lt;a href=\"Llathasa%20Indarys\"&gt;Llathasa Indarys&lt;/a&gt;, was brutally murdered in the courtyard of Castle Cheydinhal and the Count's attitude made some suspect that a darker plot was involved regarding her death. At around this time, the Count's son, &lt;a href=\"Farwil%20Indarys\"&gt;Farwil Indarys&lt;/a&gt; had formed the &lt;a href=\"Knights%20of%20the%20Thorn\"&gt;Knights of the Thorn&lt;/a&gt;, a knightly order that just mainly consists of Farwil's friends. The famous painter, &lt;a href=\"Rythe%20Lythandas\"&gt;Rythe Lythandas&lt;/a&gt; had lived in Cheydinhal, being the last known person wielding the &lt;a href=\"Brush%20of%20Truepaint\"&gt;Brush of Truepaint&lt;/a&gt;, an artifact of &lt;a href=\"Dibella\"&gt;Dibella&lt;/a&gt;.\nAllying with Bruma.\nWhen the &lt;a href=\"Oblivion%20Gate\"&gt;Oblivion Gate&lt;/a&gt;s had opened throughout Cyrodiil, the city-state of Cheydinhal was attacked by the Daedra. The Knights of the Thorn led by Farwil Indarys had entered the realms of the &lt;a href=\"Deadlands\"&gt;Deadlands&lt;/a&gt;, only to never make it back. &lt;a href=\"Jauffre%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;Grandmaster Jauffre&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"the%20Blades\"&gt;the Blades&lt;/a&gt; had sent the &lt;a href=\"Hero%20of%20Kvatch\"&gt;Hero of Kvatch&lt;/a&gt; to the each of the cities of Cyrodiil, to recruit them into defeating the greater siege against Bruma. When the Hero arrived, Andel Indarys was unable to send troops because of his son's disappearance and the Oblivion Gate outside of the city. The Hero entered the Oblivion Gate, where they discovered Farwil and &lt;a href=\"Bremman%20Senyan\"&gt;Bremman Senyan&lt;/a&gt; hiding from the Daedra. The three fought their way through and subsequently banished the Oblivion Gate. The fates of both Indarys and Senyan are unknown, but the gate was closed, and Cheydinhal contributed to &lt;a href=\"Defense%20of%20Bruma%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;Bruma's defense&lt;/a&gt;.\n&lt;a href=\"Fourth%20Era\"&gt;Fourth Era&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe Umbriel Crisis over Cheydinhal.\nDuring the early fourth era, the floating city of &lt;a href=\"Umbriel\"&gt;Umbriel&lt;/a&gt; was released upon the lands of Tamriel, leaving a path of destruction from &lt;a href=\"Lilmoth\"&gt;Lilmoth&lt;/a&gt; to the &lt;a href=\"Imperial%20City\"&gt;Imperial City&lt;/a&gt;. Cheydinhal was in this path, and the remaining people in the city defended themselves against the &lt;a href=\"Undead\"&gt;undead&lt;/a&gt; created by people who were affected by the city's black mist. The &lt;a href=\"Imperial%20Legion\"&gt;Imperial Legion&lt;/a&gt; had already evacuated residents of &lt;a href=\"Mountain%20Watch\"&gt;Mountain Watch&lt;/a&gt; to Cheydinhal, but as the undead advanced forward, the city guard was forced to hold the line. In parallel with the defense, members of the Legion evacuated the people of Cheydinhal onto the &lt;a href=\"Blue%20Road\"&gt;Blue Road&lt;/a&gt;, where they would eventually go to the Imperial City. The wormies, as they were called, were relentless, coming in wave after wave until they finally rolled up. The Knights of the Thorn under the command of &lt;a href=\"Ilver%20Indarys\"&gt;Ilver Indarys&lt;/a&gt; arrived late to the battle and continued back to Cheydinhal after offering horses to &lt;a href=\"Mazgar%20gra%20Yagash\"&gt;Mazgar gra Yagash&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Brennus\"&gt;Brennus&lt;/a&gt; of the Legion. \nThe undead did not succeed in taking Cheydinhal and the refugees who had fled previously decided to split into two groups, going north and south on the &lt;a href=\"Red%20Ring%20Road\"&gt;Red Ring Road&lt;/a&gt;. This saved them from all being killed and although they wanted to return back after the attack failed, they lacked the protection to make it back safely. After the &lt;a href=\"Siege%20of%20the%20Imperial%20City%20%284E%2049%29\"&gt;Siege of the Imperial City&lt;/a&gt;, Cheydinhal was reclaimed and &lt;a href=\"Titus%20Mede%20I\"&gt;Titus Mede I&lt;/a&gt; continued his reign at the Imperial City.\nGeneral Jonna's movement against the Dominion.\nDuring the &lt;a href=\"Great%20War\"&gt;Great War&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"4E%20175\"&gt;4E 175&lt;/a&gt;, the city-state of Cheydinhal hosted the second largest army against the &lt;a href=\"Third%20Aldmeri%20Dominion\"&gt;Third Aldmeri Dominion&lt;/a&gt;, who were advancing towards the &lt;a href=\"Heartlands\"&gt;Heartlands&lt;/a&gt; of Cyrodiil. Under the command of &lt;a href=\"General%20Jonna\"&gt;General Jonna&lt;/a&gt;, the Eastern Legion moved across the &lt;a href=\"Nibenay\"&gt;Nibenay&lt;/a&gt; and to the southern end of the &lt;a href=\"Red%20Ring%20Road\"&gt;Red Ring Road&lt;/a&gt;, attempting to meet with the Army led by &lt;a href=\"General%20Decianus\"&gt;General Decianus&lt;/a&gt;. Jonna's Army had taken heavy resistance from the Dominion, who was coming from the city-states of &lt;a href=\"Skingrad\"&gt;Skingrad&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Bravil\"&gt;Bravil&lt;/a&gt;. As &lt;a href=\"Titus%20Mede%20II\"&gt;Titus Mede II&lt;/a&gt; was facing &lt;a href=\"Lord%20Naarifin\"&gt;Lord Naarifin&lt;/a&gt; from the north, Jonna's Legion was holding the Dominion in the south, keeping a solid defense. By the fifth day of the battle, Naarifin and his forces in the Imperial City were surrounded by the Empire. At that point, the &lt;a href=\"Battle%20of%20the%20Red%20Ring\"&gt;Battle of the Red Ring&lt;/a&gt; was over, and the Mede Empire reclaimed the Imperial City. The fighting stopped due to the adoption of the &lt;a href=\"White-Gold%20Concordat\"&gt;White-Gold Concordat&lt;/a&gt;, which had prevented war for several decades and caused the Empire's power to dwindle in the northern territories.\nThe Fall of the Dark Brotherhood in Cheydinhal.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Dark%20Brotherhood\"&gt;Dark Brotherhood&lt;/a&gt; slowly, albeit significantly declined in the provinces in the Fourth Era. The Sanctuary within Cheydinhal remained as one of the largest chapters, with this one being led by &lt;a href=\"Alisanne%20Dupre\"&gt;Alisanne Dupre&lt;/a&gt;. The Cheydinhal Sanctuary was one of the more prominent sanctuaries of the Brotherhood, with the &lt;a href=\"Wayrest%20Sanctuary\"&gt;Wayrest Sanctuary&lt;/a&gt; falling to Corsairs, and the &lt;a href=\"Corinthe%20Sanctuary\"&gt;Corinthe Sanctuary&lt;/a&gt; being absorbed into the Cheydinhal chapter. Contemporaneously, tensions arose in the city-state of Bravil, where the &lt;a href=\"Night%20Mother\"&gt;Night Mother&lt;/a&gt; was being held. Dupre left her residence to protect the crypt, but the crypt was ultimately destroyed and Dupre killed. The Night Mother was retrieved by &lt;a href=\"Garnag\"&gt;Garnag&lt;/a&gt;, the only survivor of the crypt's downfall. &lt;a href=\"Rasha%20%28Lore%29\"&gt;Rasha&lt;/a&gt;, the \"de facto\" leader and &lt;a href=\"Black%20Hand\"&gt;Black Hand&lt;/a&gt;, named &lt;a href=\"Cicero\"&gt;Cicero&lt;/a&gt;, a Brotherhood Assassin, the Keeper of the Night Mother. As time went on, nobody was dubbed the Listener, and Rasha's grip on the Cheydinhal Sanctuary slipped. By the 1st of &lt;a href=\"Hearthfire\"&gt;Hearthfire&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"4E%20189\"&gt;4E 189&lt;/a&gt;, Cheydinhal had erupted into chaos, but the Sanctuary remained undetected. A couple of days later, Rasha declared himself the Listener, but was proven wrong and killed by a deranged Cicero. Eventually, only three members remained in the Cheydinhal Sanctuary: Cicero, Garnag, and &lt;a href=\"Pontius\"&gt;Pontius&lt;/a&gt;. Pontius was killed, and Garnag had disappeared, leaving only Cicero with the Night Mother. By &lt;a href=\"4E%20200\"&gt;4E 200&lt;/a&gt;, Cicero left the Cheydinhal Sanctuary to the chapter in &lt;a href=\"Falkreath%20Hold\"&gt;Falkreath Hold&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Skyrim\"&gt;Skyrim&lt;/a&gt;, where he would be taken in by &lt;a href=\"Astrid\"&gt;Astrid&lt;/a&gt;, the leader of the Brotherhood in &lt;a href=\"4E%20201\"&gt;4E 201&lt;/a&gt;."}

Being so close to Morrowind, Cheydinhal is populated and influenced considerably by the &lt;a href=\"Dunmer%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;Dunmer&lt;/a&gt;. To the north is &lt;a href=\"Lake%20Arrius\"&gt;Lake Arrius&lt;/a&gt;; to the south, the &lt;a href=\"Reed%20River\"&gt;Reed River&lt;/a&gt;\u00a0and to the southeast, &lt;a href=\"Lake%20Poppad\"&gt;Lake Poppad&lt;/a&gt;. Cheydinhal is built next to a lake at the foot of the mountains. The city is ruled by Count &lt;a href=\"Andel%20Indarys\"&gt;Andel Indarys&lt;/a&gt;. A house is available in this town for 15,000 . Cheydinhal is accessible from the &lt;a href=\"Imperial%20City%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;Imperial City&lt;/a&gt;\u00a0by walking along the &lt;a href=\"Red%20Ring%20Road\"&gt;Red Ring Road&lt;/a&gt; going east to the &lt;a href=\"Blue%20Road\"&gt;Blue Road&lt;/a&gt;. The Cyrodiil branch of the &lt;a href=\"Dark%20Brotherhood%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;Dark Brotherhood&lt;/a&gt; is located here as well.\nDescription.\nThe first impression of a visitor to Cheydinhal is that of broad green parklands and graceful willows. Along the banks of the &lt;a href=\"Corbolo%20River\"&gt;Corbolo River&lt;/a&gt;, neatly groomed gardens and flowering shrubs adorn the edges. Cheydinhal is prosperous with clean, well trimmed houses and neat stonework, ornamented with striking designs in glass, metal, and wood.\nCount and Countess.\nOne of the Dunmer immigrants who left Morrowind to come to Cyrodiil became Count Cheydinhal. &lt;a href=\"Andel%20Indarys\"&gt;Andel Indarys&lt;/a&gt; was of &lt;a href=\"House%20Hlaalu\"&gt;House Hlaalu&lt;/a&gt; in Morrowind, but he came to Cheydinhal searching for greater opportunity. His sudden rise into the highest ranks of Cyrodilic nobility is hard to explain, and most of the old and established families of Cyrodiil rightly regard him as a presumptuous upstart. However, the discovery of the Count's wife, Lady &lt;a href=\"Llathasa%20Indarys\"&gt;Llathasa Indarys&lt;/a&gt;, badly battered and dead at the foot of the County Hall stairs immediately attracted scandal, and rumors of the Count's dissipation, rages, and infidelities suggests a darker mystery behind her death.\nLayout.\nCheydinhal is divided into three districts. To the north, on a hill is the courtyard and inner keep of &lt;a href=\"Castle%20Cheydinhal\"&gt;Castle Cheydinhal&lt;/a&gt;. A road runs east-west below the castle from East Gate to West Gate. The Corbolo River runs roughly north-south from this road, dividing southern Cheydinhal into two districts, Chapel in the east, and Market in the west. In the Market District, lie all the shops, inns, and guild halls. In the Chapel District is the Chapel itself and Cheydinhal's residences. Bridges span the Corbolo in the north and south, with the south bridges connecting upon a little island park in the middle of the river.\nIn the eastern section of Cheydinhal, there is an \"&lt;a href=\"Abandoned%20House%20%28Cheydinhal%29\"&gt;Abandoned House&lt;/a&gt;\" that is only being used as a front to the &lt;a href=\"Dark%20Brotherhood\"&gt;Dark Brotherhood&lt;/a&gt;, a cult of assassins. The Count is allegedly aware of its existence.\nChapel District.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Great%20Chapel%20of%20Arkay\"&gt;Great Chapel of Arkay&lt;/a&gt; in Cheydinhal is poorly attended. The Count does not set a good example, as he never sets foot in the Chapel. Cheydinhal's primate, priest, and healer are good people, and staunch professors of the faith, but the most honored and respected of the chapel's clerics is &lt;a href=\"Errandil\"&gt;Errandil&lt;/a&gt;, the Living Saint of &lt;a href=\"Arkay\"&gt;Arkay&lt;/a&gt;, a tireless crusader against the wicked practice of necromantic sorcery in the &lt;a href=\"Mages%20Guild%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;Mages Guild&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Fighters%20Guild%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;Fighters Guild&lt;/a&gt;.\nMarket District.\nThe poorest of Cheydinhal's residences are bright and clean, with well-groomed grounds.\nPeople and culture.\nThough Cheydinhal lies in Nibenay, its culture is shaped by the Dark Elf immigrants who migrated there in the past half century from the neighboring Morrowind. Many of these immigrants were fleeing Morrowind's rigid society and heathen &lt;a href=\"Tribunal%20Temple\"&gt;Tribunal Temple&lt;/a&gt; theocracy. In Cyrodiil, they hoped to find the stimulating commercial atmosphere inspired by &lt;a href=\"Zenithar\"&gt;Zenithar&lt;/a&gt;'s patronage.\nLodgings and shops.\nThe shops and inns are all located in the western section of the city, located between the guess. Cheydinhal has two\u00a0inns with rooms available for rent.\u00a0The &lt;a href=\"Newlands%20Lodge\"&gt;Newlands Lodge&lt;/a&gt; is owned by a Dark Elf, and sells rooms for 10 a night, while\u00a0the &lt;a href=\"Cheydinhal%20Bridge%20Inn\"&gt;Cheydinhal Bridge Inn&lt;/a&gt; is owned by an &lt;a href=\"Imperials%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;Imperial&lt;/a&gt; matron,\u00a0who sells rooms for 25 a night. The owner and proprietor of Cheydinhal's bookstore, &lt;a href=\"Mach-Na\"&gt;Mach-Na&lt;/a&gt;, provides a selection of books for purchase. Armor and weapons can be bought and sold at &lt;a href=\"The%20March%20Rider\"&gt;The March Rider&lt;/a&gt;. One can trade general goods at &lt;a href=\"Borba%27s%20Goods%20and%20Stores\"&gt;Borba's Goods and Stores&lt;/a&gt;.\nFactions.\nFighters Guild.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Cheydinhal%20Fighters%20Guild\"&gt;Cheydinhal Fighters Guild&lt;/a&gt; is operated by &lt;a href=\"Burz%20gro-Khash\"&gt;Burz gro-Khash&lt;/a&gt;, who offers quests to the &lt;a href=\"Hero%20of%20Kvatch\"&gt;Hero of Kvatch&lt;/a&gt;. They are in order:\nMages Guild.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Cheydinhal%20Mages%20Guild\"&gt;Cheydinhal Mages Guild&lt;/a&gt;, run by six mages of apparently equal power, in the Guildhall located behind the &lt;a href=\"Cheydinhal%20Bridge%20Inn\"&gt;Cheydinhal Bridge Inn&lt;/a&gt;, the first building seen on the right when entering from the West Gate. Quests:\nDark Brotherhood.\nThe Cyrodiil location is located in the &lt;a href=\"Abandoned%20House%20%28Cheydinhal%29\"&gt;Abandoned House&lt;/a&gt;."}

As part of &lt;a href=\"Join%20the%20Mages%20Guild\"&gt;Join the Mages Guild&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"Hero%20of%20Kvatch\"&gt;Hero&lt;/a&gt; must get a recommendation from each city's &lt;a href=\"Mages%20Guild%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;Mages Guild&lt;/a&gt; Hall.\nWalkthrough.\n&lt;a href=\"Falcar\"&gt;Falcar&lt;/a&gt;, the head of the Cheydinhal Mages Guild, will send the Hero to find a &lt;a href=\"Ring%20of%20Burden\"&gt;Ring of Burden&lt;/a&gt; in a &lt;a href=\"Mages%20Guild%20Well\"&gt;well behind the Cheydinhal Mages Guild&lt;/a&gt;. He tells them to talk to &lt;a href=\"Deetsan\"&gt;Deetsan&lt;/a&gt; first for the key to the well. To talk to Deetsan, Falcar cannot be around. She talks about a prior associate, &lt;a href=\"Vidkun\"&gt;Vidkun&lt;/a&gt;, sent to fulfill the same task, who never returned.\nUpon entry to the well, the Hero will be submerged in water the entire time, so they will need to be quick about it, cast &lt;a href=\"Water%20Breathing%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;Water Breathing&lt;/a&gt;, use the spell &lt;a href=\"Buoyancy%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;Buoyancy&lt;/a&gt; (provided by Deetsan), or simply wear the &lt;a href=\"Jewel%20of%20the%20Rumare\"&gt;Jewel of the Rumare&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"Fin%20Gleam\"&gt;Fin Gleam&lt;/a&gt;, or some other article of clothing enchanted with water breathing.\nOff to the right will be the former associate's floating body. Search it and the Ring of Burden will be in his possession. It is recommended that the Hero goes to a &lt;a href=\"Merchants%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;merchant&lt;/a&gt; first or bring along a spell of &lt;a href=\"Feather%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;Feather&lt;/a&gt; as the ring is heavy, 150 , so they may easily become encumbered beneath the water.\nA time consuming, but simple method is to pick up the ring and then quickly drop it. It is possible to walk while grabbing it to the well exit, pick up the ring and exit the well. Then it can be dropped again and carried into the Guildhall.\nAnother proven method is to dump the majority of the inventory outside the well and come back for it later. However, be sure not to lose precious potions, ingredients, or anything else dark or small. The Hero can also dump their items into a chest in the Mages Guild, and then loot all and not risk losing anything.\nWhen returning the ring, Falcar will be gone and Deetsan will tell of a confrontation she had with him. She will give the Hero a chance to investigate his room to check whether he really did write a recommendation for them.\nUpon searching Falcar's drawers in the living quarters, there will be two special &lt;a href=\"Black%20Soul%20Gem%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;Black Soul Gems&lt;/a&gt;, one of the tools of the dark arts: necromancy. Return those to Deetsan, while keeping any loot that may be found, and she will write a recommendation, and mysteriously claim that \"things are far worse than I thought.\""}

She will become Jarl of &lt;a href=\"the%20Pale\"&gt;the Pale&lt;/a&gt; if the Legion occupies Dawnstar.\nPersonality and traits.\nBrina is a stern woman who tolerates no foolishness from those under her command, a trait she shares with fellow Nord &lt;a href=\"Legate%20Rikke%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Legate Rikke&lt;/a&gt;. She does have a warm side that sometimes shows, but this is rarely seen due to the &lt;a href=\"Civil%20War\"&gt;Civil War&lt;/a&gt;. When it comes to the recent return of the &lt;a href=\"Dragons%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;dragons&lt;/a&gt;, Brina is able to see how serious the problem is, unlike &lt;a href=\"Skald%20the%20Elder\"&gt;Skald&lt;/a&gt;, who simply believes that the dragons will vanish once the Empire is driven out. If Brina becomes Jarl, she proves to be a more respected ruler than Skald, understanding Dawnstar's vulnerabilities to dragon attacks and making preparations to alleviate the issues. Likewise Brina is flexible and open minded, acknowledging the flaws of the empire which she supports as well as convincing Madena to aid the town with her healing abilities as a mage.\nBackground.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Imperial%20Legion%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Imperial Legion&lt;/a&gt;.\nBrina did not come from Skyrim originally, but from &lt;a href=\"Cyrodiil\"&gt;Cyrodiil&lt;/a&gt;.

The Jarl, Skald the Elder, does not trust her because of her past and accuses her of espionage in favor of the &lt;a href=\"Empire\"&gt;Empire&lt;/a&gt;. However, most of the citizens of Dawnstar would rather go to her to get guidance than the Jarl and so she is one of the most prominent people in Dawnstar.\nInteractions.\n&lt;a href=\"Hired%20Muscle\"&gt;Hired Muscle&lt;/a&gt;.\nBrina is a possible target needed to be intimidated by initiating a brawl.\nCivil War.\nReunification of Skyrim.\nIf the &lt;a href=\"Last%20Dragonborn\"&gt;Dragonborn&lt;/a&gt; joins the side of the Empire in the Civil War, and takes &lt;a href=\"Fort%20Dunstad\"&gt;Fort Dunstad&lt;/a&gt; in their favor, Skald the Elder will be exiled from the Pale and as a natural choice Brina will take his place.\nLiberation of Skyrim.\nIf she becomes the Jarl during \"&lt;a href=\"Season%20Unending\"&gt;Season Unending&lt;/a&gt;,\" and the Dragonborn later retakes the Pale for the &lt;a href=\"Stormcloaks\"&gt;Stormcloaks&lt;/a&gt;, she and Horik will be exiled to &lt;a href=\"The%20Winking%20Skeever\"&gt;The Winking Skeever&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Solitude%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Solitude&lt;/a&gt;.\nDialogue.\n\"The Jarl and I have our disagreements.

Brindle is known for its isolation, as it is far from both the &lt;a href=\"Orange%20Road\"&gt;Orange Road&lt;/a&gt; in the north and the &lt;a href=\"Gold%20Road\"&gt;Gold Road&lt;/a&gt; in the south. In recent years, the fort has fallen asunder to a simple village forgotten by the cityfolk of Cyrodiil.\nDescription.\nGeography.\nAs mentioned before, Brindle is located far from both the Orange Road and the Gold Road, where the cities of &lt;a href=\"Chorrol\"&gt;Chorrol&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Skingrad\"&gt;Skingrad&lt;/a&gt; are located. In its prime, Brindle had a large keep surrounded by a large stone wall like the other strongholds in the area. During the Alliance War, Central Cyrodiil was split into three regions occupied by the different alliances. Castle Brindle was located in the area held by the &lt;a href=\"First%20Aldmeri%20Dominion\"&gt;First Aldmeri Dominion&lt;/a&gt;, and it was on the edge of the territory. &lt;a href=\"Gottlesfont%20Priory\"&gt;Gottlesfont Priory&lt;/a&gt; is a minor settlement that consists of a chapel to the &lt;a href=\"Nine%20Divines\"&gt;Nine Divines&lt;/a&gt;, it is a considerable distance from Brindle Home. When Brindle was originally Castle Brindle, the priory was built outside of the eastern wall.\nHistory.\n&lt;a href=\"Second%20Era\"&gt;Second Era&lt;/a&gt;.\nDuring the &lt;a href=\"Interregnum\"&gt;Interregnum&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"2E%20582\"&gt;2E 582&lt;/a&gt;, Central Cyrodiil was split into three regions that were controlled by the three factions fighting in the &lt;a href=\"Alliance%20War\"&gt;Alliance War&lt;/a&gt;. The area around Castle Brindle was under the supervision of the First Aldmeri Dominion, and it served as their protection from the &lt;a href=\"Daggerfall%20Covenant\"&gt;Daggerfall Covenant&lt;/a&gt; in the north. Castle Brindle was berated several times by both the Dominion and the Covenant, and even the &lt;a href=\"Ebonheart%20Pact\"&gt;Ebonheart Pact&lt;/a&gt;, which had territory on the other side of the province. The nearby town of &lt;a href=\"Vlastarus\"&gt;Vlastarus&lt;/a&gt; was a significant settlement sought out by the alliances of the war. Control over Vlastarus was determined by having control over Castle Brindle and as result, many fought to take Brindle.\n&lt;a href=\"Third%20Era\"&gt;Third Era&lt;/a&gt;.\nDuring the &lt;a href=\"Oblivion%20Crisis\"&gt;Oblivion Crisis&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"3E%20433\"&gt;3E 433&lt;/a&gt;, Castle Brindle was ransacked and destroyed, reducing the settlement to nothing but a simple farming village. Residents of Castle Brindle had either moved on into the nearby settlements or left to areas further than the Great Forest. A retired &lt;a href=\"Imperial\"&gt;Imperial&lt;/a&gt; veteran named &lt;a href=\"Melus%20Petilius\"&gt;Melus Petilius&lt;/a&gt; lived in Brindle Home and served as their protector from local &lt;a href=\"Goblin\"&gt;Goblin&lt;/a&gt;s and &lt;a href=\"Bandits\"&gt;Highwaymen&lt;/a&gt;. Petilius was targeted by &lt;a href=\"Molag%20Bal\"&gt;Molag Bal&lt;/a&gt;, and he sent his follower to torture the man, who was grieving for his wife. Enraged, Petilius murdered the follower, leaving another death on his conscious."}

She is the Grand Spymaster in the &lt;a href=\"Iliac%20Bay\"&gt;Iliac Bay&lt;/a&gt; region. She infiltrated the court of &lt;a href=\"Daggerfall%20%28City%29\"&gt;Daggerfall&lt;/a&gt; in the guise of one of the witches of &lt;a href=\"Popudax\"&gt;Popudax&lt;/a&gt;.\nHistory.\nWhen &lt;a href=\"Nulfaga\"&gt;Nulfaga&lt;/a&gt;, the Queen Mother of Daggerfall, found the location of the &lt;a href=\"Mantella\"&gt;Mantella&lt;/a&gt;, the heart that fueled the &lt;a href=\"Numidium\"&gt;Numidium&lt;/a&gt;, the Emperor &lt;a href=\"Uriel%20Septim%20VII\"&gt;Uriel Septim VII&lt;/a&gt; sent a letter to the Queen of Daggerfall, Queen &lt;a href=\"Mynisera\"&gt;Mynisera&lt;/a&gt;. A special seal on the envelope was supposed to tip off Lady &lt;a href=\"Brisienna\"&gt;Brisienna&lt;/a&gt; that in fact the letter was intended for her. She was supposed to get the location of the Mantella by any means necessary. However, the &lt;a href=\"War%20for%20Betony\"&gt;War for Betony&lt;/a&gt; delayed the arrival of the letter. The letter arrived very late, after the war, and was received by Queen &lt;a href=\"Aubk%27i\"&gt;Aubk'i&lt;/a&gt;. Confused, the Queen sold the letter to King &lt;a href=\"Gortwog%20gro-Nagorm\"&gt;Gortwog&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Orsinium%20%28Daggerfall%29\"&gt;Orsinium&lt;/a&gt;.\nWhen the ghost of &lt;a href=\"King%20Lysandus\"&gt;King Lysandus&lt;/a&gt; haunted the streets of Daggerfall, the Emperor sent an &lt;a href=\"The%20Agent\"&gt;agent&lt;/a&gt; to soothe Lysandus' soul, and at the same time get the controversial letter back. The agent arrived late due to a storm that wrecked his ship. Fortunately, Lady &lt;a href=\"Brisienna\"&gt;Brisienna&lt;/a&gt; managed to locate the agent and meet with him. She told the agent to investigate the three royal, dominating powers in the Iliac Bay region, Daggerfall, Sentinel, and Wayrest in order to know the reason of &lt;a href=\"Lysandus%20of%20Daggerfall\"&gt;Lysandus&lt;/a&gt;'s haunting and to procure the letter.\nAfter the agent successfully soothed the soul of Lysandus and procured the letter, a mysterious friend told him the history of the Numidium. Soon later, all of the factions in the &lt;a href=\"Iliac%20Bay\"&gt;Iliac Bay&lt;/a&gt; region became aware that the agent was working to find the &lt;a href=\"Mantella\"&gt;Mantella&lt;/a&gt;. Lady Brisienna meet the agent and asked for their help to get the &lt;a href=\"Totem%20of%20Tiber%20Septim\"&gt;Totem of Tiber Septim&lt;/a&gt;, which the &lt;a href=\"Blades%20%28Daggerfall%29\"&gt;Blades&lt;/a&gt; had lost. The agent found the totem in the Daggerfall vault. Then, more letters came to the agent, promising wealth and fame in exchange for the totem. Lady Brisienna had sent one of those letters.\nIn the end, after the agent recovered the Mantella, the Blades were then one of the wielders of the Numidium. The Empire's intelligence agency was one of the seven retrievers of the Totem of Tiber Septim, a tool for controlling the &lt;a href=\"Dwemer\"&gt;Dwemer&lt;/a&gt; construct.\nInteractions.\n&lt;a href=\"Instructions%20from%20the%20Empire\"&gt;Instructions from the Empire&lt;/a&gt;.\nReceive Lady Brisienna's letter and meet with her at an inn of her choosing.\n&lt;a href=\"Totem%2C%20Totem%2C%20Who%20Gets%20the%20Totem%3F\"&gt;Totem, Totem, Who Gets the Totem?&lt;/a&gt;.\nFind the &lt;a href=\"Totem%20of%20Tiber%20Septim\"&gt;Totem of Tiber Septim&lt;/a&gt;, and decide who gains its power.\nDialogue.\n\"\"Ah, thank you for responding to my letter, . I am Lady Brisienna. Let me bring you to date on affairs. The spectre of King Lysandus haunts the streets of Daggerfall at night. Trying to communicate with him is futile. He will occasionally moan the word \"Vengeance,\" but that is the only coherent word I have ever heard him utter. If you are ever in Daggerfall, do not wander the city at night. You are certain to be attacked by his own legion of ghosts.\"\"\n\"It would be probably more gainful to investigate those who might have wronged Lysandus to find the cause behind his torment. I do not know if the royal family of Daggerfall or another person or persons merit more suspicion. The major powers of the Bay Sentinel, Wayrest, and Daggerfall may be good places to start.\"\n\"In the matter of the letter, the Emperor's agent says that he was unable to hand-deliver it to the Queen because of the war. He hired a courier who supposedly delivered the letter in his stead. We do not even know the name of this courier. Obviously, there is little information of use, but it would be worthwhile to see whether the letter arrived at Castle Daggerfall at all. How you decide to do this is entirely your decision. I will contact you if any new information should surface.\"\n\"I am leaving Daggerfall soon. My position here has been compromised and my life is in danger. Do not mention my name in court. It is more likely to hurt than help. Good luck, and watch your back, .\"\n\", I'm glad you could meet me here. The Blades and your emperor need you again. You may or may not be aware that the Totem of Tiber Septim has been found. For a brief time Lord Woodborne of Wayrest had it. Where he got it from is still a mystery. The Blades mounted an assault upon Woodborne Hall to retrieve it. Although the Hall fell, many of our number fell with it. We sacked the Woodborne Hall, but the Totem was gone. I have reason to believe that Gothryd has the Totem. The Blades no longer have the men to mount an assault on Castle Daggerfall. You have shown yourself to be quite adept at getting in and out of these places. Would you go into Castle Daggerfall and retrieve the Totem of Tiber Septim?\"\nUpon returning with the Totem:\n\"Your Emperor will be most grateful. The Totem could have started a civil war in the wrong hands. Thank you . Now you must away to Nulfaga. She holds the key to the Mantella. Free the Mantella, and the Emperor controls Great Numidium through the Totem.\""}

At the bottom are the corpses of two &lt;a href=\"Reaver%20%28Dragonborn%29\"&gt;reavers&lt;/a&gt;, but when it is approached, a riekling jumps out of the barrel nearby. From this point, turning left (west), the cave turns south and leads to a dead end. Back at the ambush point, the cave continues north down another slope. At the bottom, an encampment is off to the left (west), protected by three rieklings.\nContinuing on north, there is another riekling. The passage becomes quite narrow, then widens into a long room where many more rieklings are living. There are many potions here, along with a chest at the northern end against the west wall, and a riekling hut with random loot against the southwest wall of the room.\nClose to the northern end of the room, another passage leads east. At the first tent, a riekling will pop up from the snow floor. In the room beyond, numerous other rieklings are present to do battle.\nAt the eastern end of the room, a tent on the left contains an unlocked strong box with a single gem, and just past that is a master-locked chest with random loot. The path continues south, where another riekling is waiting in ambush. There is another riekling hut containing random loot.\nThe path turns left (east) again, proceeds through another narrow passage, and when it widens, leads to another ambush, plus several more rieklings who attack. It turns left (north) to another camp area with a riekling hut against the left (west) wall.\nAt the very northern end of the room, the path turns to the right and eventually heads south down a slope to another riekling camp area. At the southern end of the room is a riekling hut with random loot. To its left is a barrel with an &lt;a href=\"East%20Empire%20Company%20strongbox\"&gt;East Empire Company strongbox&lt;/a&gt; on top, and just to its right is an open crate with the book &lt;a href=\"Ahzidal%27s%20Descent\"&gt;Ahzidal's Descent&lt;/a&gt; (which, upon reading, begins a &lt;a href=\"Miscellaneous%20Quests%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;miscellaneous quest&lt;/a&gt; to \"Investigate Kolbjorn Barrow\").\nThe passage continues down to the right (west), where two more rieklings wait in ambush. The path takes a sharp bend to the right (northeast), then another sharp bend to the left (west) down to a small camp area where a single riekling waits. The path continues up a slope, then levels out. Where it turns left (south), there are two riekling huts, protected by four rieklings.\nAfter going south, the path turns left (east) and leads to a very large room with many rieklings. A ramp against the left (north) wall leads down to one camp area, but the room continues up to the right (south), where a bridge needs to be crossed to get to the other side. This area has several unmounted and mounted &lt;a href=\"Bristleback%20%28Dragonborn%29\"&gt;bristlebacks&lt;/a&gt;. There are also two riekling huts to be looted.\nThere are two paths out from this room that start from the back (south) wall. One leads to the east down a narrow slope, then turns left (north), where a riekling hut and chest are found on the left side. The path continues down, then turns left (west) and leads to a dead end with a master-locked chest containing minor loot.\nThe other leads up to the southwest. It turns south and comes to a riekling hut with a chest to its left and a table to its right with various loot on/in them. The path turns left (east) and leads up a slope, then takes a left-hand U-turn, then right right (north) and comes out above one of the first rooms in the cave (the first dead end). This can be used as a shortcut back to the entrance (jumping down, then proceeding north, east, then south)."}

Naryu wants to help you, but needs assistance as well.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Dark%20Elf\"&gt;Dark Elf&lt;/a&gt; wants to test the hero's skills before they do anything. An objective that is in fact a short combat tutorial starts.

Optionally, spar with Naryu again. The quest marker leads to one of the huts on the island. After entering it, sneak to avoid being noticed by the &lt;a href=\"Guar%20%28Online%29\"&gt;guar&lt;/a&gt; sleeping inside.\nGo downstairs. Deactivate a &lt;a href=\"Bear%20Traps%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Bear Trap&lt;/a&gt; at the end of the stairs. The lock of the chest downstairs is of trivial difficulty. Pick it and take the Gate Key and the &lt;a href=\"Heirloom%20Necklace\"&gt;Heirloom Necklace&lt;/a&gt;. Search a backpack on the table and take a lockpick from it.\nExit this hut and follow the quest marker to another hut. Search a drunk &lt;a href=\"Slaver%20Guard\"&gt;Slaver Guard&lt;/a&gt; and take his &lt;a href=\"Dishonored%20Slaver%27s%20Jerkin\"&gt;Dishonored Slaver's Jerkin&lt;/a&gt;. On the floor, there is a &lt;a href=\"Dishonored%20Slaver%27s%20Greatsword\"&gt;Dishonored Slaver's Greatsword&lt;/a&gt;, take it as well. Equip both items. Then, a &lt;a href=\"Slaver%20Cutthroat\"&gt;Slaver Cutthroat&lt;/a&gt; comes from the basement and attacks. Defeat him with the obtained greatsword and return to Naryu.\nRendezvous with the slaves.\nOn the way to find Naryu, talk to slaves who are now gathered outside. Talk to Eoki. It turns out that the plan has changed, since the slavers are returning to the island. Naryu sent a signal to the &lt;a href=\"House%20Guard\"&gt;House Guard&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Seyda%20Neen%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Seyda Neen&lt;/a&gt; and that's when the slaver horn started sounding.\nGive the Gate Key to Eoki.

She needs the Vestige's help in ending the slavers, saving their prisoners and sinking the slaver ship. Go to the docks to gather &lt;a href=\"Fire%20Salts%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Fire Salts&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Kindlepitch\"&gt;Kindlepitch&lt;/a&gt; to create a &lt;a href=\"Fire%20Bomb\"&gt;Fire Bomb&lt;/a&gt;.

Defeat the &lt;a href=\"Slaver%20Thug\"&gt;Slaver Thug&lt;/a&gt;s on the way.\nEnter the slaver ship by using a rowboat at the docks and follow Naryu, who is now disguised as a slaver, too. The ship is under attack, because the forces from Seyda Neen have arrived as well, so the Vestige and the Morag Tong assassin go unnoticed, looking like the crew. Go below decks. Defeat &lt;a href=\"First%20Mate%20Ulveni\"&gt;First Mate Ulveni&lt;/a&gt;, who will initiate combat when she sees the intruders. Next, use the Fire Bomb in a nearby room with debris. After the bomb is used, Captain Svadstar will appear. Before you can react, Naryu Virian stealthily kills the Captain.\nJump into the water with Naryu to escape the burning ship.\nArriving at Seyda Neen.\nAfter waking up in a cabin inside &lt;a href=\"The%20Windstorm\"&gt;The Windstorm&lt;/a&gt;, talk to &lt;a href=\"Sergeant%20Delms\"&gt;Sergeant Delms&lt;/a&gt;. You are now accused of being a slaver, due to the slaver disguise. The Sergeant takes the Vestige to the &lt;a href=\"Census%20and%20Excise%20Office%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Census and Excise Office&lt;/a&gt;. There, &lt;a href=\"Governor%20Salvi\"&gt;Governor Salvi&lt;/a&gt; demands more answers. The Vestige was found in a wreckage of the slaver ship near &lt;a href=\"Firemoth%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Firemoth&lt;/a&gt;, wearing slaver gear, and that's suspicious. Then, Naryu Virian shows up to show the Governor an assassination writ from the Morag Tong. Thanks to her intervention, the Vestige is pardoned and free to go anywhere."}

The big noisy festivals I remember very well -- &lt;a href=\"Harvest%27s%20End%20%28Holiday%29\"&gt;Harvests' End&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Mid%20Year\"&gt;Mid Year&lt;/a&gt;, New Year, the &lt;a href=\"Emperor%27s%20Day\"&gt;Emperor's Day&lt;/a&gt;.\nAll of these I have memories of that stretch back before I became truly aware of the meaning of our celebrating. On the 19th of &lt;a href=\"Frost%20Fall\"&gt;Frost Fall&lt;/a&gt;, every year, my family and I would walk to a ruined castle in the middle of the wilderness, together with everyone else we knew in the Moors. Hands clutched in hands, we would form an enormous circle around the ruins, and head reverently bowed we would sing a song, the &lt;a href=\"Sepharve\"&gt;Sepharve&lt;/a&gt;.\nFor years, we did this and I never asked why. It is an odd thing that normally curious children, from my experience, never ask questions about Broken Diamonds, and adults seldom volunteer information. Gradually, as we learn about our homeland through university or the prattling of ancient relatives, we come to guess and then know the meaning of Broken Diamonds.\nI cannot be objective as a native of Glenumbra Moors, but visitors have told me that the sorrow\u2014more often they use the word shame\u2014of the natives is almost overwhelming. There is a sense that a great and ancient crime still burns in the conscience of the people of the Moors. Though it did not happen in our lifetimes, we know that the debt is not yet paid.\nI refer, of course, to the murder of Her Terrible Majesty, &lt;a href=\"Kintyra%20II\"&gt;Kintyra II&lt;/a&gt;, Emperess of &lt;a href=\"Tamriel\"&gt;Tamriel&lt;/a&gt;, on the frozen morning of the 23rd of Frost Fall, in the year &lt;a href=\"3E%20123\"&gt;3E 123&lt;/a&gt;.\nWe do not know the name of the castle where she was held; we do not know the name of her murderer (though the man who ordered the murder was her cousin and usurper, &lt;a href=\"Uriel%20III\"&gt;Uriel III&lt;/a&gt;); we do not know where she was buried. But our ancestors knew that their rightful ruler was imprisoned somewhere in their land, and did nothing to help her. For that, we bear their shame.\nOn that morning, when our great-great grandparents heard of Kintyra's death, all were stricken with horror and regret at their lack of action. All the people of &lt;a href=\"Glenpoint%20%28Daggerfall%29\"&gt;Glenpoint&lt;/a&gt; and Glenumbra Moors searched out those responsible in every Imperial castle. They formed barriers with their bodies to hold the killer within. Flags bearing the &lt;a href=\"Red%20Diamond\"&gt;Red Diamond&lt;/a&gt; of the Septim family were torn and scattered, and broken diamonds littered the snow.\nThe song we sing every Broken Diamonds, as I mentioned before, is the Sephavre. I asked everyone in Glenumbra Moor what the meaning of the song is, for it is in &lt;a href=\"Old%20Bretic\"&gt;Old Bretic&lt;/a&gt;, and each generation only knows it because they were taught by their parents. No one knew the exact meaning of the words, not even the tone and emotion the words can be easily translated. When I later talked to a scholar who gave me an accurate translation of the Sephavre, I began to understand both why our ancestors chose it as the anthem for the great injustice of the murder of Kintyra II and the sorrow that still Glenumbra Moors since that dark morn.\nThe Sephavre\n&lt;poem&gt;Souls of our fathers, suffer deeply,\nFor you have led us to the dark time,\nWhen our own souls, filled with air,\nAllowed ignorance and villainy to thrive\nIn what used to be our land.\nHowl, ancestors, howl and bring us\nMemories of our conformance with evil.\nWe do anything we can to survive,\nGiving up our minds and hearts and bodies\nWe will not fight, and we will be torn\nAnd like flotsam in a whirling tide\nWe will be forever the agents of injustice\nBut we will mourn it forever.&lt;/poem&gt;"}

I'm likely either dead or in the dungeon, but I was able to send word your way. I don't have solid proof that this &lt;a href=\"Icereach%20Coven\"&gt;Icereach Coven&lt;/a&gt; you're hunting is in &lt;a href=\"Haafingar%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Haafingar&lt;/a&gt; hold, but something's rotten in the capital city of &lt;a href=\"Solitude%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Solitude&lt;/a&gt;. I know I'm on the right trail. Unfortunately, it seems they know it, too. I wish I had more information for you. I'm sorry.\nBring what I found to &lt;a href=\"Queen%20Gerhyld\"&gt;Queen Gerhyld&lt;/a&gt;. She's more levelheaded than the high king. Without her influence, I doubt you'll even be allowed to see &lt;a href=\"High%20King%20Svargrim\"&gt;High King Svargrim&lt;/a&gt;.\nBrondold\n&lt;The journal itself reads as follows.&gt;\nThis assignment is going to be more challenging than I anticipated. Locals are suspicious of strangers. Guards always seem to be watching. Even in a city the size of Solitude\u2014even among &lt;a href=\"Nords%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Nords&lt;/a&gt;\u2014I stick out like a sore thumb.\nMade one contact at the royal stables. Young woman named &lt;a href=\"Kovynn\"&gt;Kovynn&lt;/a&gt;. Starry-eyed. Naive. Told her to keep watch for unusual travelers. No one else is talking. I'm going to settle into a routine. Get people used to seeing me around.\nEverything passes through &lt;a href=\"the%20Lonely%20Troll\"&gt;the Lonely Troll&lt;/a&gt; at some point. It's the best place in the city to talk to the locals and learn about what's going on. There's an &lt;a href=\"Orsimer%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Orc&lt;/a&gt; that frequents the establishment. Goes by the name of &lt;a href=\"Maugh\"&gt;Maugh&lt;/a&gt;. He seems willing to talk, as long as you keep his mug filled. If anyone knows something about the Icereach Coven, I'm sure to find them in the Lonely Troll.\nAny trust I built up with the locals evaporated at the mere mention of witches. Won't say a word about them, unless you count prayers to the gods. I guess they take dark magic more seriously this close to &lt;a href=\"The%20Reach%20%28Online%29\"&gt;the Reach&lt;/a&gt;, but they'd rather shut their ears to it than court misfortune.\nKorvynn came through for me. Said some rugged types arrived on mountain mares, trying a little too hard not to be noticed. They put up postings all around town. Recruiting for something. Sharp girl.\n&lt;A recruitment flier is stuffed in between the pages.&gt;\nLaborers and Craft Workers Needed!\nBrave folk sought for distant and dangerous work in uncharted territory beyond the &lt;a href=\"Druadach%20Mountains\"&gt;Druadach Mountains&lt;/a&gt;. Travel mandatory. Food and lodging provided. A yearlong commitment required, with rewards to match the risks!\nInquire at the Lonely Troll Inn in Solitude\n&lt;Note scribbled at the bottom of the flier.&gt;\nSeen these postings across the hold. Nobody seems to know what all this labor's for or where it's needed.\n&lt;The journal continues.&gt;\nI noticed &lt;a href=\"Redguards%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Redguard&lt;/a&gt; ships making regular stops at the docks here. Considering my chilly reception, I find that curious.\nCost me a good bit of gold, but the local snitch, &lt;a href=\"Greyga\"&gt;Greyga&lt;/a&gt;, who I found gambling in an alley, provided a solid lead. Redguard mariners are bringing shipments up from &lt;a href=\"Sentinel%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Sentinel&lt;/a&gt;. Manifests say housewares. Crews looks more like mercenaries than traders. She saw one discreetly marking some of the crates. Think I'll poke around.\nTried to grab what was inside, but I got caught and it slipped from my hand before I could wrest it from the crate. I managed to lose the thugs who were after me. I'm just hoping they never got a good look at me.\nSupposed to meet with Lyris Titanborn before her audience with Queen Gerhyld at the Blue Palace. Tell her what I've found so she can convince High King Svargrim that there's a threat to his domain. All I've got is suspicions. Nothing solid. I've heard the high queen rules with a lighter touch. She might be the sympathetic ear that gets us in the door."}

Just stay calm, like Chancellor Ocato says, and pray for the Emperor and his sons.\nNote 3: Crumpled Piece of Paper.\nMother,\nWhat do you expect me to do about it? Come to the City, track down the assassins, and bring them to justice myself?\nAnd are there assassins banging on your door? Do you have some reason to think they're coming for you next?\nPlease. Don't panic. These assassinations have upset everyone. But you just have to go on with your life.\nI don't know what you're worried about. Everything is fine here. Everyone is getting on with business, like the &lt;a href=\"Chancellor%20Ocato\"&gt;Chancellor&lt;/a&gt; says. The Elder Council has everything under control. Certainly you don't expect me to\nNote 4: Letter to Mother.\nMother,\nPlease don't worry. The &lt;a href=\"Elder%20Council\"&gt;Elder Council&lt;/a&gt; knows what it is doing. Uriel was an old man. They knew he wouldn't live forever, and I'm sure they had plans for the succession. Of course, now with the three princes dead, it's not clear who will be the next emperor, but it's happened before -- there are precedents, I'm sure -- and anyway, Ocato and the Council have been running the Empire for the past 15 years anyway. So there's nothing to worry about. Everything will be fine.\nI don't know what you've read or heard, but here at the Priory everyone seems to think it must have been madmen or witches or crazy cultists. It doesn't look at all political. It's horrible and depressing, but the Empire will survive. There will not be rioting or civil war or another Warp in the West. So please. If you like, go stay with Uncle Korr and Aunt Harrah on the farm for a while. But I'm certain you'll be perfectly safe in the &lt;a href=\"Imperial%20City%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;City&lt;/a&gt;. I'll try to get down to visit as soon as possible. And I hope to hear from you soon.\nyour loving son,&lt;a href=\"Brother%20Piner\"&gt;Piner&lt;/a&gt;"}

The Brothers of Strife was the site of an important battle between the &lt;a href=\"Chimer\"&gt;Chimer&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Nedes\"&gt;Nedes&lt;/a&gt;. It is named after the two Chimer warriors that sacrificed themselves to defeat the Nedes, as well as the large statue over the ruin.\nDescription.\nGeography.\nThe Brothers of Strife is situated south of &lt;a href=\"Ebonheart\"&gt;Ebonheart&lt;/a&gt;, in a canyon located east of the &lt;a href=\"Tormented%20Spire\"&gt;Tormented Spire&lt;/a&gt;, where &lt;a href=\"Sadal\"&gt;Sadal&lt;/a&gt;, one of the Brothers of Strife was sealed away. Continuing towards the ruins, the river would eventually end. On the north end is a small cave with a &lt;a href=\"Daedric\"&gt;Daedric&lt;/a&gt; shrine. Continuing south will lead to the Daedric ruins. The eastern ruins surround a foundation with twin ritual braziers. To the northeast and southeast are watchpoints, look throughout the ruins. To the west of the ruins is a pass connecting Zabamat to the region of &lt;a href=\"Varanis\"&gt;Varanis&lt;/a&gt;, eventually leading into &lt;a href=\"Deshaan\"&gt;Deshaan&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Kragenmoor\"&gt;Kragenmoor&lt;/a&gt;. Atop of the ruins is a large statue of Balreth and Sadal, the Brothers of Strife. Throughout the land is large deposits of &lt;a href=\"Heart%20Stone\"&gt;Heart Stone&lt;/a&gt;s, which is a stone created from the volcanoes of Morrowind.\nHistory.\n&lt;a href=\"First%20Era\"&gt;First Era&lt;/a&gt;.\nDuring the early First Era, the &lt;a href=\"Chimer\"&gt;Chimer&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Nede\"&gt;Nede&lt;/a&gt;s of Stonefalls waged war with each other in the &lt;a href=\"Nede-Chimer%20War\"&gt;Nede-Chimer War&lt;/a&gt;. The Nedes sought to expand and conquer the land, including where the Chimer had already settled. At first, the Chimer sought diplomatic resolve, but the Nedes were unnegotiable, and everyone was not spared from their wrath, including women and children. Leading the Chimeri defense was &lt;a href=\"General%20Balreth\"&gt;General Balreth&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Legate%20Sadal\"&gt;Legate Sadal&lt;/a&gt;, esteemed warriors of modern-day Stonefalls. The Nedes had vast control over Stonefalls, cutting the Chimer's connection to the Inner Sea. The Chimer were suffering from the Nedes, being forced into a Daedric Ruin in Zabamat. The Chimer were dwindling in numbers, but Balreth and Sadal were able to destroy the Nedes with unconventional means. Using an ancient ritual with Nedic hearts, the &lt;a href=\"Essence%20of%20Wrath\"&gt;Essence of Wrath&lt;/a&gt;, and the &lt;a href=\"Essence%20of%20Fire\"&gt;Essence of Fire&lt;/a&gt;, the two transformed into the &lt;a href=\"Brothers%20of%20Strife%20%28Creatures%29\"&gt;Brothers of Strife&lt;/a&gt;, two powerful &lt;a href=\"Bone%20Colossi\"&gt;Bone Colossi&lt;/a&gt;. The Brothers decimated the Nedes, but wreck havoc throughout Stonefalls, killing everyone in their path, they need to be sealed away. The powerful Chimeri mage, &lt;a href=\"Mavos%20Siloreth\"&gt;Mavos Siloreth&lt;/a&gt; used his benevolent power to seal the Brothers of Strife in the twin spires of Stonefalls. The legend of the Brothers of Strife remained forever in Stonefalls.\n&lt;a href=\"Second%20Era\"&gt;Second Era&lt;/a&gt;.\nDuring the &lt;a href=\"Interregnum\"&gt;Interregnum&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"2E%20582\"&gt;2E 582&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"House%20Telvanni\"&gt;House Telvanni&lt;/a&gt; sent &lt;a href=\"Sorcerer%20Vunal\"&gt;Sorcerer Vunal&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Sorcerer%20Nilae\"&gt;Sorcerer Nilae&lt;/a&gt; to the Brothers of Strife, to uncover the history behind these Stonefalls legends. Vunal sought the help of an &lt;a href=\"Vestige\"&gt;adventurer&lt;/a&gt; who was passing through the area. They gathered the &lt;a href=\"Heart%20Stone\"&gt;Heart Stone&lt;/a&gt;s in the area and met with Nilae, to establish a link to the past. Nilae commenced a ritual where the adventurer underwent visions of the past, to see how the two Chimer warriors became the Brothers of Strife. In the end, the Telvanni wizards were able to gather the proper information, returning to their home with the records they were able to acquire."}

The town is run by pirates! Even so, the magister insists I show a \"rigorous mind,\" whatever that means.\nEntry 43\nI thought the magister was being literal, so I delivered a fresh &lt;a href=\"Minotaur%20%28Online%29\"&gt;minotaur&lt;/a&gt; brain to the guild hall. I'm no fool; I thought to wrap it in three layers of waxed paper. I don't see why it caused such a fuss.\nEntry 45\nThe magister realized I have no practical knowledge of the &lt;a href=\"Dreugh%20%28Online%29\"&gt;dreugh&lt;/a&gt;, either. I now have a book about dreugh mating practices and a directive: \"Find an alchemical use for grom.\" What in &lt;a href=\"Oblivion%20%28Realm%29\"&gt;Oblivion&lt;/a&gt; is grom?\nEntry 46\nI read the book. Grom is shell of a dreugh which it has eaten and then regurgitated after mating. \"Fibrous balls,\" according to the book. \"Foul-smelling.\" There are no known uses for grom, alchemical or otherwise. I'm beginning to think the magister doesn't much like me.\nEntry 47\nI've made camp at a dreugh mating ground on the coast north of Anvil. The creatures are docile unless provoked, which allows me to observe them and collect as much grom as I need. Joyous day.\nEntry 48\nI thought I knew tedium. Now, my life consists of waiting for dreugh to mate.\nEntry 49\nI've spotted my first ball of grom! This is what passes for excitement, now.\nEntry 50\nThe old book wasn't lying. There is no alchemical use for grom, unless it's \"ruin a variety of expensive alchemical ingredients,\" or \"permanently stain mortar and pestle.\"\nBut I won't let the magister show me up.\nEntry 51\nI can confirm grom is inedible. Boiling just makes the smell worse.\nEntry 52\nBoiling was the key! As it cooled, the fibrous pulp hardened into the same shell. I realized that, in this state, I could form and shape the pulp. I was able to fashion a simple potion flask that took a stopper well. Potion flasks that won't smash if you drop them? There's your alchemical application, magister. Of course, I've run out of grom. In order to reproduce my results, I need more dreugh to reproduce.\nEntry 53\nMore tedium. Why can't the dreugh mate faster?\nEntry 54\nI can make the dreugh mate faster! While dumping an alchemical concoction into the sea, a nearby dreugh seemed to perk up and rub its claws together. It immediately sought out another dreugh and paced about, circling it. More activity than I've yet seen from these creatures. I'll cook up another batch and sprinkle it along the beach tonight.\nEntry 55\nThe dreugh seem agitated. Now they all pace, but the mating still isn't happening any faster.\nTonight I'll increase the batch's potency by a factor of eight. If that doesn't get them over their lethargy, I don't know what will! "}

The fleet was said to have been the most powerful navy ever assembled on &lt;a href=\"Tamriel\"&gt;Tamriel&lt;/a&gt; and the creation of this fleet, for a time, dwarfed the rest of the &lt;a href=\"Imperial%20Navy\"&gt;Imperial Navy&lt;/a&gt;. The navy had enough heavy transport capacity to move four &lt;a href=\"Imperial%20Legion\"&gt;Legions&lt;/a&gt; at a time.\nIt took the navy six weeks to go from &lt;a href=\"Black%20Harbor\"&gt;Black Harbor&lt;/a&gt; to &lt;a href=\"Septimia\"&gt;Septimia&lt;/a&gt;. During the colonization of Akavir, it was the plan to bring two reinforcing Legions to &lt;a href=\"Akavir\"&gt;Akavir&lt;/a&gt;, but the fateful decision was made to delay their arrival and instead begin using the Fleet to transport colonists. The &lt;a href=\"Uriel%20V\"&gt;Emperor&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Elder%20Council\"&gt;Council&lt;/a&gt; agreed that, due to the complete abandonment of the conquered area by its native population, colonists were needed to work the fields so that the Expeditionary Force would not have to rely entirely on the fleet for supplies. In addition, unrest had broken out in &lt;a href=\"Yneslea\"&gt;Yneslea&lt;/a&gt;, on the supply route to Akavir, and the Council believed the &lt;a href=\"Ninth%20Legion\"&gt;Ninth&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Seventeenth%20Legion\"&gt;Seventeenth&lt;/a&gt; legions would be better used in repacifying those territories and securing the Expeditionary Force's supply lines.\nDuring the winter storm season of 3E 288\u2013289, a large portion of the Fleet, including the Emperor's flagship, was destroyed. The winter season was unusually prolonged and exceptionally severe, and prevented the Fleet from returning to Akavir as planned with additional supplies. Due to prolonged bad weather during &lt;a href=\"Sun%27s%20Height\"&gt;Sun's Height&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"3E%20289\"&gt;3E 289&lt;/a&gt;, the supply fleet was late in setting out from Black Harbor. It finally left port in early &lt;a href=\"Second%20Seed\"&gt;Second Seed&lt;/a&gt;, but was again severely mauled by storms and limped into Septimia eight weeks later much reduced. Because of the increasingly desperate supply situation in Akavir, the Emperor dispatched most of his\u00a0&lt;a href=\"Imperial%20Legion%20Battlemage%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;Battlemage&lt;/a&gt;\u00a0Corps with the fleet to assist it in weathering the storms which seemed likely to continue all summer.\nIn mid-Sun's Height, The fleet had arrived safely back to Black Harbor, thanks to the Battlemage Corps, but all attempts to return to Akavir were frustrated by a series of ever more savage storms that battered &lt;a href=\"Esroniet\"&gt;Esroniet&lt;/a&gt; throughout the rest of\u00a0289. By &lt;a href=\"Evening%20Star\"&gt;Evening Star&lt;/a&gt;, the Council was extremely worried about the situation in Akavir and ordered the fleet to sail regardless of the risk. Despite the continued storms, the fleet managed to press on to Akavir. The fleet arrived in Septimia to find its garrison under savage assault from a large Tsaesci army. The battlemages with the fleet threw back the enemy long enough for the survivors to embark and the fleet to withdraw."}

At this time, there is no indication that either group is aware of the other's correspondence. The College of Winterhold has thus far declined requests for direct meetings. This has been at the specific request of Arch-Mage Aren.\"\n\"\"Aren believed that although the initial communications were innocent enough, they were sent with a particular motive in mind. The Synod's harsh rules and draconian structure are maintained only by suppressing any opposition to their Council's policies. It is entirely possible that they look to our College here in Winterhold in order to find supporters for their organization. Likewise, the College of Whispers has long been driven by its desire to directly oppose the Synod. They focus on research banned by the Synod, such as Conjuration and Necromancy. The College of Whispers hopes to learn that our College also supports these avenues of research. Thus they may claim that the Synod is indeed a political minority in the Empire and should be treated as such.\"\n\"\"Our actual position and policies are irrelevant. No matter the facts of the response, it will certainly be twisted to suit the whims of either group. Indeed, it has been jokingly suggested that we send the exact same response to both, which each will warp into support for their side. At present, these two groups do little beyond attempting to gain the attention and favor of the Emperor. They appear to have little interest in real study and research for the sake of gaining knowledge.\"\n\"Arch-Mage Aren believes that their conflict poses a significant threat to the autonomy of our College, and I concur. Falling in with either would threaten to draw much unwanted attention to our College. If either group goes through less official channels and attempt to contact you directly, please refer them to the College's Master Wizard. Say as little as possible so as to avoid compromising our neutral position.\""}

He is scripted for the archetypal absent-minded professor, being far more focused on abstract thought and scientific curiosity than to prefer practical interpersonal communication or stagnant common sense. He treats the &lt;a href=\"Skyrim%20Civil%20War\"&gt;Skyrim Civil War&lt;/a&gt; with overall distaste, seeing it as an obstacle to progress, but his personal loyalty and respect for Jarl Balgruuf transcends such things.\nDragon Research.\nPrior to the Dragonborn's arrival at Dragonsreach, Farengar regarded dragons as hypothetical, mythical phenomena. He is fascinated upon learning their existence and expresses wishes to see one in person; however, his wish is denied by Jarl Balgruuf on the grounds that it is too dangerous and that Farengar is needed alive in Dragonsreach in order to continue researching ways to counter a dragon attack. \nLater, during Odahviing's capture, Farengar attempts to perform some tests for his research, but is sent running by a blast of fire from the angered dragon.\nStudy.\nFarengar's study is attached to the main hall of Dragonsreach. He sells &lt;a href=\"Spell%20Tomes%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;spell tomes&lt;/a&gt; and has an &lt;a href=\"Alchemy%20Lab%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;alchemy lab&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"arcane%20enchanter\"&gt;arcane enchanter&lt;/a&gt;. Additionally, Farengar sells enchanting supplies and is himself an &lt;a href=\"enchanter\"&gt;enchanter&lt;/a&gt;.\nInteractions.\n&lt;a href=\"Bleak%20Falls%20Barrow%20%28Quest%29\"&gt;Bleak Falls Barrow&lt;/a&gt;.\nArriving in Whiterun to inform the Jarl of the dragon attack at &lt;a href=\"Helgen\"&gt;Helgen&lt;/a&gt;, the Dragonborn is asked by Farengar to retrieve the &lt;a href=\"Dragonstone\"&gt;Dragonstone&lt;/a&gt; from &lt;a href=\"Bleak%20Falls%20Barrow%20%28Location%29\"&gt;Bleak Falls Barrow&lt;/a&gt;. It is possible that the Dragonborn already got the stone while helping &lt;a href=\"Lucan%20Valerius\"&gt;Lucan Valerius&lt;/a&gt; recover &lt;a href=\"The%20Golden%20Claw%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;The Golden Claw&lt;/a&gt; that was stolen from him.\n&lt;a href=\"Dragon%20Rising\"&gt;Dragon Rising&lt;/a&gt;.\nUpon returning to Dragonsreach, Farengar will thank the Dragonborn for retrieving the Dragonstone, noting that the Jarl or Proventus will see to a reward. He is then summoned by &lt;a href=\"Irileth\"&gt;Irileth&lt;/a&gt;, to which the Dragonborn is invited to come along as well. After Balgruuf sends his &lt;a href=\"Housecarl\"&gt;Housecarl&lt;/a&gt; and the Dragonborn to the &lt;a href=\"Western%20Watchtower\"&gt;Western Watchtower&lt;/a&gt;, Farengar expresses a desire to see a live dragon, although Balgruuf denies this since he is already risking Irileth for the mission.\n&lt;a href=\"The%20World-Eater%27s%20Eyrie\"&gt;The World-Eater's Eyrie&lt;/a&gt;.\nWhen the Dragonborn traps &lt;a href=\"Odahviing%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Odahviing&lt;/a&gt; in Dragonsreach, Farengar asks if he can run some tests on him and does so even when Odahviing says, \"Begone mage, do not test my promise to the Dovahkiin.\" Eventually, despite Irileth warning him that what he is doing is a bad idea, Odahviing lets out a stream of fire that sends Farengar running from the room as Balgruuf reprimands him.\nCollege and errands.\nAsking Farengar about his wares can spark the \"&lt;a href=\"College%20of%20Winterhold%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Visit College of Winterhold&lt;/a&gt;\" quest. Farengar also asks the Dragonborn to deliver &lt;a href=\"Frost%20Salts%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;frost salts&lt;/a&gt; to &lt;a href=\"Arcadia\"&gt;Arcadia&lt;/a&gt; at &lt;a href=\"Arcadia%27s%20Cauldron\"&gt;Arcadia's Cauldron&lt;/a&gt; in Whiterun. When successfully delivered, Arcadia mentions the &lt;a href=\"ingredients%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;ingredients&lt;/a&gt; will be used to craft a Love Potion which she says she will test on Farengar, possibly joking.\n&lt;a href=\"The%20Whispering%20Door\"&gt;The Whispering Door&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe Dragonborn has the option of killing Farengar or picking his pocket to obtain a key to the room containing the &lt;a href=\"Ebony%20Blade%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Ebony Blade&lt;/a&gt;. It is possible to pickpocket the key from him even with a low pickpocket skill.\nStealing.\n&lt;a href=\"Stealing\"&gt;Stealing&lt;/a&gt; from him at any point may result in a contract to have &lt;a href=\"hired%20thug\"&gt;hired thug&lt;/a&gt;s kill the Dragonborn.\n&lt;a href=\"Inheritance\"&gt;Inheritance&lt;/a&gt;.\nIf Farengar dies, either by circumstance or being murdered by the Dragonborn, he bequeaths a sum of 100 to the Dragonborn, 10 of which is removed by the Jarl as tax.\nDialogue.\n\"\"Come to Dragonsreach to discuss the ongoing hostilities, like the rest of the \"great warriors\"?\"\"\n\"You know, if you've got the aptitude, you should join the Mages College in Winterhold...\"\n\"\"Come to Dragonsreach to discuss the ongoing hostilities, like the rest of the \"great warriors\"?\"\"\nIf one has waited for Jarl Balgruuf, the dialogue will start with the following line, which is otherwise added to the previous one.\n\"So the Jarl thinks you can be of use to me? Oh yes, he must be referring to my research into the dragons. Yes, I could use someone to fetch something for me. Well, when I say fetch, I really mean delve into a dangerous ruin in search of an ancient stone tablet that may or may not actually be there.\"\n\"Ah! The Dragonstone of Bleak Falls Barrow! Seems you are a cut above the usual brutes the Jarl sends my way.\"\n\"It seems this damnable conflict has claimed everyone's passions of late. Me? I prefer my books, and my spells.\"\nConversations.\nFarengar: \"You see? The terminology is clearly First Era or even earlier. I'm convinced this is a copy of a much older text. Perhaps dating to just after the Dragon War. If so, I could use this to cross-reference the names with other later texts.\"\nDelphine: \"Good. I'm glad you're making progress. My employers are anxious to have some tangible answers.\"\nFarengar: \"Oh, have no fear. The Jarl himself has finally taken an interest, so I'm now able to devote most of my time to this research.\"\nDelphine: \"Time is running, Farengar, don't forget. This isn't some theoretical question. Dragons have come back.\"\nFarengar: \"Yes, yes. Don't worry. Although the chance to see a living dragon up close would be tremendously valuable... Now, let me show you something else I found... very intriguing... I think your employers may be interested as well...\"\nDelphine \"You have a visitor.\"\"\nFarengar: \"Hmm? Ah, yes, the Jarl's protege! Back from Bleak Falls Barrow? You didn't die, it seems. Ah! The Dragonstone of Bleak Falls Barrow! Seems you are a cut above the usual brutes the Jarl sends my way. My... associate here will be pleased to see your handiwork. She discovered its location, by means she has so far declined to share with me.\"\nFarengar: \"So your information was correct after all. And we have our friend here to thank for recovering it for us.\"\nDelphine: \" went into Bleak Falls Barrow and got that? Nice work. Just send me a copy when you've deciphered it.\"\nIrileth: \"Farengar! Farengar, you need to come at once. A dragon's been sighted nearby. should come, too.\"\nFarengar: \"A dragon! How exciting! Where was it seen? What was it doing?\"\nIrileth: \"I'd take this a bit more seriously if I were you. If a dragon decides to attack Whiterun, I don't know if we can stop it. Let's go.\"\nBalgruuf: \"So, Irileth tells me you came from the western watchtower?\"\nWhiterun Guard: \"Yes, my lord.\"\nIrileth: \"Tell him what you told me. About the dragon.\"\nWhiterun Guard: \"Uh... that's right. We saw it coming from the south. It was fast... faster than anything I've ever seen.\"\nBalgruuf: \"What did it do? Is it attacking the watchtower?\"\nWhiterun Guard: \"No, my lord. It was just circling overhead when I left. I never ran so fast in my life... I thought it would come after me for sure.\"\nBalgruuf: \"Good work, son. We'll take it from here. Head down to the barracks for some food and rest. You've earned it. Irileth, you'd better gather some guardsmen and get down there.\"\nIrileth: \"I've already ordered my men to muster near the main gate.\"\nBalgruuf: \"Good. Don't fail me.\"\nAfter a brief conversation between the Jarl and the Dragonborn, the conversation continues:\nFarengar: \"I should come along. I would very much like to see this dragon.\"\nBalgruuf: \"No. I can't afford to risk both of you. I need you here working on ways to defend the city against these dragons.\"\nFarengar: \"As you command.\"\nBalgruuf: \"One last thing, Irileth. This isn't a death or glory mission. I need to know what we're dealing with.\"\nIrileth: \"Don't worry, my lord. I'm the very soul of caution.\"\nFarengar: \"Incredible! Uh... sir, you have no idea how long I have waited for such an opportunity! I would be most appreciative if you would permit me to perform some, ah, tests on you. Purely in the interests of the advancement of knowledge.\"\nOdahviing: \"Begone, mage. Do not test my promise to the Dovahkiin.\"\nFarengar: \"I assure you, you will not even notice me. Most of them are hardly painful at all to a large dragon such as yourself.\"\nIrileth: \"Farengar, very bad idea.

This barrel is looted by beginners on their way through the building. If the ring is returned to Fargoth, his disposition will increase and he will put in a good word for the Nerevarine with &lt;a href=\"Arrille\"&gt;Arrille&lt;/a&gt; at &lt;a href=\"Arrille%27s%20Tradehouse\"&gt;Arrille's Tradehouse&lt;/a&gt;, giving them a discount there.\n&lt;a href=\"Fargoth%27s%20Hiding%20Place\"&gt;Fargoth's Hiding Place&lt;/a&gt;.\nTo start this quest, the Nerevarine can either hear the rumors about Hrisskar's money problems or speak to the captain himself. Hrisskar will say he suspects Fargoth is hiding his money, and suggests that the Nerevarine go to the top of the &lt;a href=\"Seyda%20Neen%20Lighthouse%20%28Morrowind%29\"&gt;lighthouse&lt;/a&gt; to spy on Fargoth. After waiting until 10 pm, the Bosmer is seen lurking towards a tree stump in the swamp. Once Fargoth leaves, the Nerevarine can check the stump to confirm Hrisskar's suspicion: 300 gold is stashed there, along with the Engraved Ring of Healing from the earlier quest and a &lt;a href=\"Journeyman%27s%20Lockpick\"&gt;journeyman's lockpick&lt;/a&gt;.\nDialogue.\nBitter Coast region \"\"The &lt;a href=\"Bitter%20Coast%20%28Morrowind%29\"&gt;Bitter Coast&lt;/a&gt; is named for the salt marshes along the coast northwest of town.

One doesn't have to hear these rumors, however, to start the quest. Talk to Hrisskar at the top story of Arrille's Tradehouse in &lt;a href=\"Seyda%20Neen%20%28Morrowind%29\"&gt;Seyda Neen&lt;/a&gt; and ask about his money troubles. Hrisskar will relate that he believes &lt;a href=\"Fargoth\"&gt;Fargoth&lt;/a&gt; has been hiding money from him and will ask that his hiding place is found. He suggests going to the top of the lighthouse in town at night and spy on him from there. He warns the player not to approach Fargoth during this time.\nGo to the top of the lighthouse in town and wait until 10 PM and watch Fargoth start sneaking towards the tree stump in the swamp (he will sneak around a bit before heading to the tree stump, so it is best to be patient). Don't worry about losing him, he carries a torch. Once he leaves the stump go to it and collect the 300 gold, the &lt;a href=\"Engraved%20Ring%20of%20Healing\"&gt;Engraved Ring of Healing&lt;/a&gt; from the earlier quest and a &lt;a href=\"Journeyman%27s%20Lockpick\"&gt;Journeyman's Lockpick&lt;/a&gt;.\nReturn to the trade house and give the 300 gold to Hrisskar. He will give thanks and a reward of 100 gold. Keep the other items found in the tree stump. Alternately, simply keep the gold. He can be given the 300 gold to finish the quest at any time. If Hrisskar is questioned about Fargoth after the quest he will admit he just likes messing with the fellow and that he put Fargoth's ring in that barrel."}

It is a realm of &lt;a href=\"Oblivion\"&gt;Oblivion&lt;/a&gt;, not ruled by any &lt;a href=\"Daedric%20Princes\"&gt;Daedric Princes&lt;/a&gt; and houses a mixed community of both mortal and &lt;a href=\"Daedra%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Daedric&lt;/a&gt; inhabitants. Due to it not being within the domain of any Daedric Prince, the realm's liminal barriers are considered weak enough to be adjacent to all other planes and realms, making travel to and from easier than other realms.\nBackground.\nFargrave, although beyond the jurisdiction of any &lt;a href=\"Daedric%20Prince\"&gt;Daedric Prince&lt;/a&gt; or conventional government, is regulated under an agreement known as the &lt;a href=\"Stricture\"&gt;Stricture&lt;/a&gt;. Although only Daedra are compelled by their nature to follow the rules of the Stricture, mortals are also expected to abide by it, and lawbreakers are punished under the authority of the &lt;a href=\"The%20Grasp\"&gt;Grasp&lt;/a&gt;.\nFargrave was first discovered by mortals in &lt;a href=\"1E%201261\"&gt;1E 1261&lt;/a&gt; by the &lt;a href=\"Imperials%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Imperial&lt;/a&gt; traders of &lt;a href=\"House%20Hexos\"&gt;House Hexos&lt;/a&gt;. Sometime later, House Hexos formed an agreement with the &lt;a href=\"Dark%20Seducer\"&gt;Dark Seducer&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Madam%20Whim\"&gt;Madam Whim&lt;/a&gt; and moved their entire enterprise from Tamriel to Fargrave, bringing along goods and services from the mortal realm. Around Fargrave are four gargantuan skeletal remains known as the &lt;a href=\"Bearers%20of%20Fargrave\"&gt;Bearers of Fargrave&lt;/a&gt; which mortals speculate are the detritus of four Daedric Princes that destroyed each other while fighting for domination over the realm; was a necropolis for massive beings; or that Fargrave was once carried by the Bearers across Oblivion.\nLocations.\nThe following are locations accessible in Fargrave and, with the exception of &lt;a href=\"Unmarked%20Locations%20%28Online%29\"&gt;unmarked locations&lt;/a&gt;, are discoverable on the map. Points of Interest serve as locations with unique side quests, while &lt;a href=\"Cities%20%28Online%29\"&gt;cities&lt;/a&gt; serve as the centralised areas with multiple sublocations and act as a hub for services and &lt;a href=\"Merchants%20%28Online%29\"&gt;merchants&lt;/a&gt;. Explanations of the types of locations are provided in the &lt;a href=\"Locations%20%28Online%29%23Types\"&gt;main locations page&lt;/a&gt;.\nQuests.\nFargrave features a series of zone story quests and unrelated side quests. The zone story quests are shared with &lt;a href=\"The%20Deadlands%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Deadlands&lt;/a&gt; and tie into the &lt;a href=\"Gates%20of%20Oblivion\"&gt;Gates of Oblivion&lt;/a&gt; overarching storyline, carrying on from &lt;a href=\"Blackwood%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Blackwood&lt;/a&gt;. It is not necessary to complete the story quests for zones prior to those in Fargrave. Side quests are non-sequential and can be completed in any order, except where one carries on from another. &lt;a href=\"Repeatable%20quests\"&gt;Repeatable quests&lt;/a&gt; can be completed multiple times: weekly for arenas and trials and daily for all others.\nItem Sets.\nItem sets are related armor and weapons that, when worn together, provide unique benefits. Overland sets can be acquired from world bosses, world events, delves, public dungeons and containers and as quest rewards; dungeon sets can be acquired from within group dungeons; monster sets can be acquired from the final boss of veteran group dungeons and Undaunted Enclaves; and crafted sets can be created at specific locations across the zone.\nSkyshards.\nOne Skyshard can be found in Fargrave that provides one of three needed for a &lt;a href=\"skill%20point\"&gt;skill point&lt;/a&gt;. The zone guide provides clues as to the location of each Skyshard, but many can be found simply by exploring and watching for the distinctive pillar of light they emit. Skyshards will appear on the map and compass when the Vestige is close to one and will remain discovered on the map even if it was not collected.\nAchievements.\nAchievements can be earned by completing specific tasks such as completing quests and discovering locations. Achievements are separated into categories and their progress is viewable from the journal. Earning achievement provides the Vestige a number of points, and some achievements unlock unique rewards such as &lt;a href=\"Furnishings%20%28Online%29\"&gt;furnishings&lt;/a&gt; that can be bought from Achievement Furnishers or &lt;a href=\"collectibles\"&gt;collectibles&lt;/a&gt;.\nShalidor's Library.\nTen books that are a part of Shalidor's Library can be found in Fargrave and added to the collection. Books that have already been found in other zones will already be marked as completed in the zone tracker."}

Like the rest of the Companions, he lives in &lt;a href=\"Jorrvaskr\"&gt;Jorrvaskr&lt;/a&gt; in the Wind District of Whiterun. He is a Master-level &lt;a href=\"Trainers%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;trainer&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Heavy%20Armor%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Heavy Armor&lt;/a&gt; and serves as the &lt;a href=\"Last%20Dragonborn\"&gt;Dragonborn's&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Shield-Siblings\"&gt;shield-brother&lt;/a&gt; in several of the Companions' quests. He is also one of the Companions who can assign radiant quests to the Dragonborn.\nUpon completion of the Companions' main plotline, Farkas can be recruited as a &lt;a href=\"Followers%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;follower&lt;/a&gt; and becomes a potential &lt;a href=\"Marriage%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;marriage&lt;/a&gt; candidate. He can be &lt;a href=\"Rebuilding%20the%20Blades\"&gt;recruited&lt;/a&gt; into the &lt;a href=\"Blades%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Blades&lt;/a&gt; if the Dragonborn talks to &lt;a href=\"Delphine%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Delphine&lt;/a&gt; while having him as a follower.\nBackground.\nFarkas and his twin brother &lt;a href=\"Vilkas\"&gt;Vilkas&lt;/a&gt; were raised at Jorrvaskr by Jergen, who rescued them from a circle of necromancers. It is unknown if he was their biological father. Jergen left to fight in the &lt;a href=\"Great%20War\"&gt;Great War&lt;/a&gt; but never returned.\nBoth brothers eventually became official members of the Companions and rose to the ranks of the Circle. They were said to be the youngest members to ever join, though this may be a play on words by &lt;a href=\"Vignar%20Gray-Mane\"&gt;Vignar Gray-Mane&lt;/a&gt;, referring to the twins' young age during their residence at Jorrvaskr rather than the age at which their membership became official.\nPersonality.\nFarkas calls Jergen his father, and considers the Companions his family. He is especially close to his brother and follows along with his views in most situations.\n&lt;a href=\"Kodlak%20Whitemane\"&gt;Kodlak&lt;/a&gt; states in &lt;a href=\"Kodlak%27s%20Journal\"&gt;his journal&lt;/a&gt; that Farkas is \"too kindhearted\" to be Harbinger. Farkas is also the first of the Companions, apart from Kodlak, to be genuinely friendly and welcoming toward the Dragonborn when they join the order.\nVilkas jokes about Farkas being the more dim-witted of the two. Other Companions will also insult Farkas' intelligence by calling him \"icebrain\" or \"oaf.\" Farkas takes the teasing from people he likes, but states that he will punch anyone else who thinks he is not smart.\nHe takes great pride in his physical strength, and notes that he enjoys the added strength of his &lt;a href=\"Beast%20Form%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Beast Form&lt;/a&gt;. He prefers to resolve problems through bludgeoning and leave the thinking to others if possible. He does understand there are limits to such behavior; when sending the Dragonborn on \"&lt;a href=\"Hired%20Muscle\"&gt;Hired Muscle&lt;/a&gt;\" quests, he stresses the target should be beaten but not killed.\nHe wears a random set of &lt;a href=\"Steel%20Armor%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;steel armor&lt;/a&gt; minus the helmet, and carries a &lt;a href=\"Skyforge%20steel%20greatsword\"&gt;Skyforge steel greatsword&lt;/a&gt;. After the quest \"&lt;a href=\"Proving%20Honor\"&gt;Proving Honor&lt;/a&gt;,\" he carries an &lt;a href=\"Iron%20Greatsword%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;iron greatsword&lt;/a&gt; instead.\nInteractions.\nBefore &lt;a href=\"Take%20Up%20Arms\"&gt;Take Up Arms&lt;/a&gt; and after &lt;a href=\"Glory%20of%20the%20Dead\"&gt;Glory of the Dead&lt;/a&gt;, Farkas can be randomly encountered in the wilds of Skyrim traveling with fellow Companions &lt;a href=\"Athis\"&gt;Athis&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Torvar\"&gt;Torvar&lt;/a&gt;. When the Dragonborn approaches Whiterun for the first time, he can be found fighting a giant at Pelagia Farm with his shield-sisters &lt;a href=\"Aela%20the%20Huntress%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Aela the Huntress&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Ria\"&gt;Ria&lt;/a&gt;.\n&lt;a href=\"Trouble%20in%20Skyrim\"&gt;Trouble in Skyrim&lt;/a&gt;.\nIn this radiant quest, Farkas requires the Dragonborn to kill the leader in a radiant location.\n&lt;a href=\"Hired%20Muscle\"&gt;Hired Muscle&lt;/a&gt;.\nIn this radiant quest, Farkas requires the Dragonborn to brawl with a random NPC.\n&lt;a href=\"Proving%20Honor\"&gt;Proving Honor&lt;/a&gt;.\nTo test the Dragonborn's honor and skill, &lt;a href=\"Skjor\"&gt;Skjor&lt;/a&gt; sends the Dragonborn to acquire a lost &lt;a href=\"Fragment%20of%20Wuuthrad\"&gt;fragment of Wuuthrad&lt;/a&gt; from &lt;a href=\"Dustman%27s%20Cairn\"&gt;Dustman's Cairn&lt;/a&gt;. Farkas is assigned as the Dragonborn's shield-brother and observer for this quest.\nDuring the quest, the Dragonborn is trapped behind a gate and Farkas is surrounded by &lt;a href=\"Silver%20Hand\"&gt;Silver Hand&lt;/a&gt; members. He transforms into his &lt;a href=\"Beast%20Form%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Beast Form&lt;/a&gt; to slay them, and opens the gate to free the Dragonborn. After the fragment is retrieved and brought to Jorrvaskr, Farkas stands witness to the Dragonborn's honor as they are inducted into the Companions.\n&lt;a href=\"Glory%20of%20the%20Dead\"&gt;Glory of the Dead&lt;/a&gt;.\nAfter Kodlak's funeral, Farkas accompanies the remaining members of the Circle to &lt;a href=\"The%20Underforge\"&gt;The Underforge&lt;/a&gt;. The decision is made for the Circle to travel to &lt;a href=\"Ysgramor%27s%20Tomb\"&gt;Ysgramor's Tomb&lt;/a&gt; and cure Kodlak's spirit of &lt;a href=\"Lycanthropy%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;lycanthropy&lt;/a&gt; so Kodlak may ascend to &lt;a href=\"Sovngarde%20%28Location%29\"&gt;Sovngarde&lt;/a&gt;.\nWhile in the tomb, the fear of &lt;a href=\"Frostbite%20Spider%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;frostbite spiders&lt;/a&gt; that Farkas gained in Dustman's Cairn gets the better of him. He apologizes and states he will wait outside with his brother, leaving the Dragonborn and Aela to finish the quest on their own. Once the quest is complete, Farkas decides to stay at the tomb with the other Circle members for a while.\n&lt;a href=\"Purity\"&gt;Purity&lt;/a&gt;.\nFarkas wishes to rid himself of his beast blood. To cure him, the Dragonborn must take him to Ysgramor's Tomb, throw a &lt;a href=\"Glenmoril%20Witch%20Head\"&gt;Glenmoril Witch Head&lt;/a&gt; into the fire, then kill Farkas' beast spirit.\n&lt;a href=\"Dragon%20Seekers\"&gt;Dragon Seekers&lt;/a&gt;.\nAfter \"Glory of the Dead\" quest, the Dragonborn can speak to him again for more radiant quests. Eventually, he will have the quest Dragon Seekers for the Dragonborn, indicated by the speech option \"Is there any work to be done?\"\nFarkas will tell the Dragonborn of people coming to Whiterun with rumors of dragons, and how he would like to see one for himself. He will then give the Dragonborn the location of one of the Word Walls to travel to and kill the dragon located there. Once completed, he will elect to remain behind for a while so he can get the details right when he tells Vilkas of the battle.\n&lt;a href=\"The%20Bonds%20of%20Matrimony\"&gt;The Bonds of Matrimony&lt;/a&gt;.\nFarkas is also eligible for &lt;a href=\"Marriage%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;marriage&lt;/a&gt; after completion of the Companions' questline if an &lt;a href=\"Amulet%20of%20Mara%20%28Legends%29\"&gt;Amulet of Mara&lt;/a&gt; is worn when talking to him:\n\"An Amulet of Mara. You're looking for marriage, then?\"\nServices.\nHeavy Armor Training.\nFarkas can train up to level 90 in &lt;a href=\"Heavy%20Armor%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Heavy Armor&lt;/a&gt;, though his Heavy Armor skill is actually a low level.\nIf recruited as a follower, his services as a trainer are still available. Any &lt;a href=\"Septim%20%28Coin%29\"&gt;gold&lt;/a&gt; paid can be taken out of his inventory afterwards, effectively making the training free.\nFollower.\nAs a follower, Farkas has no tolerance for crime. If the Dragonborn has a bounty in any hold, Farkas will draw his sword and advance on the Dragonborn, but will not attack unless provoked.\nFarkas has very mismatched skills, due to his Blacksmith class.\nDialogue.\n\"\"My brother &lt;a href=\"Vilkas\"&gt;Vilkas&lt;/a&gt; is a better talker than me. He should be around someplace.\"\"\nConversations.\n&lt;a href=\"Take%20Up%20Arms\"&gt;Take Up Arms&lt;/a&gt;.\nSkjor: \"I told you, this is the whelp that Vilkas mentioned.\"\nAela: \"Ah, yes. I heard you gave him quite a thrashing.\"\nSkjor: \"\"Don't let Vilkas catch you saying that.\"\n[After talking to Aela]\nSkjor: \"Farkas!\"\nFarkas: \"Did you call me?\"\nAela: \"Of course we did, icebrain. Show this newblood where the rest of the whelps sleep.\"\nFarkas: \"New blood? Oh, hello. I'm Farkas. Come, follow me.\"\n&lt;a href=\"Proving%20Honor\"&gt;Proving Honor&lt;/a&gt;.\nKodlak: \"Brothers and sisters of the Circle, today we welcome a new soul into our mortal fold. This man has endured, has challenged, and has shown his valor. Who will speak for him?\"\nFarkas: \"I stand witness to the courage of the soul before us.\"\nKodlak: \"Would you raise your shield in his defense?\"\nFarkas: \"I would stand at his back, that the world might never overtake us.\"\nKodlak: \"And would you raise your sword in his honor?\"\nFarkas: \"It stands ready to meet the blood of his foes.\"\nKodlak: \"And would you raise a mug in his name?\"\nFarkas: \"I would lead the song of triumph as our mead hall reveled in his stories.\"\nKodlak: \"Then the judgement of this Circle is complete. His heart beats with fury and courage that have united the Companions since the days of the distant green summers. Let it beat with ours, that the mountains may echo and our enemies may tremble at the call.\"\nAela: \"It shall be so.\"\nSkjor: \"It shall be so.\"\nVilkas: \"It shall be so.\"\nKodlak's Burial.\nEorlund: \"Who will start?\"\nAela: \"I'll do it. Before the ancient flame... We grieve.\"\nEorlund: \"We grieve.\"\nFarkas: \"We grieve.\"\nVilkas: \"We grieve.\"\nEorlund: \"At this loss... We weep.\"\nAela: \"We weep.\"\nFarkas: \"We weep.\"\nVilkas: \"We weep.\"\nVilkas: \"For the fallen... We shout.\"\nAela: \"We shout.\"\nEorlund: \"We shout.\"\nFarkas: \"We shout.\"\nFarkas: \"And for ourselves... We take our leave.\"\nEorlund: \"We take our leave.\"\nAela: \"We take our leave.\"\nVilkas: \"We take our leave.\"\nAela: \"His spirit is departed. Members of the Circle, let us withdraw to the Underforge, to grieve our last together.\"\n&lt;a href=\"Glory%20of%20the%20Dead\"&gt;Glory of the Dead&lt;/a&gt;.\nVilkas: \"The old man had one wish before he died. And he didn't get it. It's as simple as that.\"\nAela: \"Being moon-born is not so much of a curse as you might think, Vilkas.\"\nVilkas: \"That's fine for you. But he wanted to be clean. He wanted to meet Ysgramor and know the glories of Sovngarde. But all that was taken from him.\"\nAela: \"And you avenged him.\"\nFarkas: \"Kodlak did not care for vengeance.\"\nVilkas: \"No, Farkas, he didn't. And that's not what this is about. We should be honoring Kodlak, no matter our own thoughts on the blood.\"\nAela: \"You're right. It's what he wanted, and he deserved to have it.\"\nVilkas: \"Kodlak used to speak of a way to cleanse his soul, even in death. You know the legends of the Tomb of Ysgramor.\"\nAela: \"There the souls of Harbingers will heed the call of northern steel. We can't even enter the tomb without Wuuthrad, and it's in pieces, like it has been for a thousand years.\"\nEorlund: \"And dragons were just stories. And the elves once ruled Skyrim. Just because something is, doesn't mean it must be. The blade is a weapon. A tool. Tools are meant to be broken. And repaired.\"\nVilkas: \"Is that? Did you repair the blade?\"\nEorlund: \"\"This is the first time I've had all the pieces, thanks to our Shield-Brother here. \"The flames of a hero can reforge the shattered.\" The flames of Kodlak shall fuel the rebirth of Wuuthrad. And now it will take you to meet him once more. As the one who bore the fragments, I think should be the one to carry Wuuthrad into battle. The rest of you, prepare to journey to the Tomb of Ysgramor. For Kodlak.\"\"\nNew Weapon.\n&lt;a href=\"Athis\"&gt;Athis&lt;/a&gt;: \"You might do well to learn a new weapon. Vary your style a bit.\"\nFarkas: \"\"&lt;a href=\"Swords%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Tiny blades&lt;/a&gt; don't hurt enough. A sword needs weight.\"\"\nAthis: \"But ten little cuts...\"\nFarkas: \"All I need is one to cut you in half.\"\nAthis: \"[nervous gulp] Well, when you put it that way...\"\nLittle Swords.\nFarkas: \"\"You only use the &lt;a href=\"Swords%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;little swords&lt;/a&gt;.\"\"\nAthis: \"It's called a shortsword, you oaf. It's quicker. Sharper.

Smarter.\"\nTorvar: \"Some of 'em, anyway.\"\nTime to Train.\nFarkas: \"Time to train.\"\nTorvar: \"Enough with the training, I want to go fight something.\"\nFarkas: \"\"No fighting, not just yet. Not 'till &lt;a href=\"Skjor\"&gt;Skjor&lt;/a&gt; says so. You train now.\"\"\nTorvar: \"Easy for you to say.

Blood runs hot.\"\nKodlak: \"I remember when you were the same way. The more they train, the more they'll cool down.\"\nFarkas: \"I hope so.\"\nKodlak: \"Just have them focus on the calm in the battle. Control the rage, don't let it control you.\"\nFavored Weapons.\nFarkas: \"What weapon do you like, Harbinger?\"\nKodlak: \"\"When I was young, I favored &lt;a href=\"Greatswords%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;huge swords&lt;/a&gt;, much like you. Hard to lift these days, but I still enjoy the heft of a good &lt;a href=\"Warhammers%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;hammer&lt;/a&gt;.\"\"\nFarkas: \"Big swords should always beat little swords.\"\nKodlak: \"Brave hearts beat lesser ones.

A guard explain that they took everything and left and Captain Farlivere has sent her soldiers to the estate. Find her and ask if she needs help.\nFollow the marker to find the captain, she explains the bandits use trained wolves to guard their camp. That increases their confidence but also makes them more careless. They can exploit that to save the hostages. She needs someone who can get in quietly, grab some wolf's woe and take it to the hostages. With the plant, they can walk out without attracting the attention of the wolves. The hostages are locked in a house, so the &lt;a href=\"Vestige\"&gt;Vestige&lt;/a&gt; needs to find a key to get inside. She suggests to grab a Red Rook uniform as a disguise.

I cannot complain about my task having a similar issue.\nThere is but one record of the man called &lt;a href=\"Topal%20the%20Pilot\"&gt;Topal the Pilot&lt;/a&gt;, the earliest known &lt;a href=\"Aldmer\"&gt;Aldmer&lt;/a&gt; explorer of &lt;a href=\"Tamriel\"&gt;Tamriel&lt;/a&gt;. Only four short verse fragments of the epic \"&lt;a href=\"Father%20of%20the%20Niben\"&gt;Father of the Niben&lt;/a&gt;\" have survived to present day, but they offer an interesting if controversial look at the Middle &lt;a href=\"Merethic%20Era\"&gt;Merethic Era&lt;/a&gt; when Topal the Pilot may have sailed the seas around Tamriel.\nThough \"Father of the Niben\" is the only written record of &lt;a href=\"Topal\"&gt;Topal&lt;/a&gt; the Pilot's voyages, it is not the only proof of his existence. Among the treasures of the great &lt;a href=\"Crystal%20Tower\"&gt;Crystal Tower&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"Summerset%20Isle\"&gt;Summerset Isle&lt;/a&gt; are his crude but fascinating maps, his legacy to all Tamriel.\nThe translation of the Aldmeri &lt;a href=\"Udhendra%20Nibenu\"&gt;Udhendra Nibenu&lt;/a&gt;, \"Father of the Niben,\" is my own, and I accept that other scholars may disagree with some of my choice of words. I cannot promise my translation lives up to the beauty of the original: I have only strived for simple coherence.\nFragment One:\nFor centuries, strange crystalline balls were unearthed at the sites of ancient Aldmer shipwrecks and docks, peculiar artifacts of the Merethic and &lt;a href=\"Dawn%20Era\"&gt;Dawn Era&lt;/a&gt;s that puzzled archeologists until it was demonstrated that each had a tendency to rotate on its axis in a specific direction. There were three varieties, one that pointed southward, one that pointed northeast, and one that point northwest.\nIt is not understood how they work, but they seemed attuned to particular lines of power. These are the \"waystones\" of the fragment, which each of the pilots used to point their craft in the direction they were assigned to go. A ship with a name not mentioned in the fragment took his vessel north-west, towards &lt;a href=\"Thras\"&gt;Thras&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Yokuda\"&gt;Yokuda&lt;/a&gt;. The Pasquiniel took the southern waystone, and must have sailed down toward Pyandonea. Topal and his north-east waystone found the mainland of Tamriel.\nIt is clear from this fragment what the three ships were assigned to do - find a passage back to Old Ehlnofey so that the Aldmer now living in &lt;a href=\"Summerset%20Isle\"&gt;Summerset&lt;/a&gt; could learn what became of their old homeland. As this book is intended to be a study of Topal the Pilot, there is scarcely room to dedicate to different theories of the Aldmeri exodus from Old Ehlnofey.\nIf I were using this poem as my only source, I would have to agree with the scholars who believe in the tradition that several ships left Old Ehlnofey and were caught in a storm. Those who survived found their way to Summerset Isle, but without their waystones, they did not know what direction their homeland was. After all, what other explanation is there for three ships heading in three opposite directions to find a place?\nNaturally, only one of the ships returned, and we do not know if either or both of the other two found Old Ehlnofey, or perished at sea or at the hands of the ancient &lt;a href=\"Pyandoneans\"&gt;Pyandoneans&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Sload\"&gt;Sload&lt;/a&gt;, or Yokudans. We must assume, unless we think the Aldmer particularly idiotic, that at least one of them must have been pointing in the right direction. It may well have even been Topal, and he simply did not go north-east far enough.\nSo, Topal setting sail from Firsthold heads north-east, which coincidentally is the longest one can travel along the Abecean Sea without striking land of any kind. Had he traveled straight east, he would have struck the mainland somewhere in what is now the &lt;a href=\"Colovian%20West\"&gt;Colovian West&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"Cyrodiil\"&gt;Cyrodiil&lt;/a&gt; in a few weeks. Had he traveled south-east, he might have reached the hump of Valenwood in a few days. But our pilot, judging by his own and our modern maps, sailed in a straight line north-east, through the &lt;a href=\"Abecean%20Sea\"&gt;Abecean Sea&lt;/a&gt;, and into the &lt;a href=\"Iliac%20Bay\"&gt;Iliac Bay&lt;/a&gt;, before touching ground somewhere near present day &lt;a href=\"Anticlere\"&gt;Anticlere&lt;/a&gt; in two months time.\nThe rolling verdant hills of southern &lt;a href=\"High%20Rock\"&gt;High Rock&lt;/a&gt; are unmistakable in this verse, recognizable to anyone who has been there. The question, of course, is what is to be made of this apparent reference to orcs occupying the region? Tradition has it that the orcs were not born until after the Aldmer had settled the mainland, that they sprung up as a distinct race following the famous battle between &lt;a href=\"Trinimac\"&gt;Trinimac&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Boethiah\"&gt;Boethiah&lt;/a&gt; at the time of &lt;a href=\"Resdayn\"&gt;Resdayn&lt;/a&gt;.\nIt is possible that the tradition is wrong. Perhaps the orcs were an aboriginal tribe predating the Aldmeri colonization. Perhaps these were a cursed folk -- \"&lt;a href=\"Orsimer\"&gt;Orsimer&lt;/a&gt;\" in the Aldmeris, the same word for \"Orc\" - of a different kind, whose name was to be given the orcs in a different era. It is regrettable that the fragment ends here, for more clues to the truth are undoubtedly lost.\nWhat's missing between the first fragment and the second is appreciable. It must be more than eighty months that have passed, because Topal is on the opposite side of mainland Tamriel now, attempting to sail south-west to return to Firsthold, after his failure at finding Old Ehlnofey.\nFragment Two:\nWe can see that in addition to Topal's prowess as a navigator, cartographer, survivalist, and raconteur, he is a master of archery. It may be poetic license, of course, but we do have archeological proof that the Merethic Aldmer were sophisticated &lt;a href=\"archer\"&gt;archer&lt;/a&gt;s. Their bows of layers of wood and horn drawn by silver silk thread are beautiful, and still, I have heard experts say, millennia later, very deadly.\nIt is tempting to imagine it a &lt;a href=\"Dragons%20%28Lore%29\"&gt;dragon&lt;/a&gt;, but the creature that Topal faces at the beginning of this fragment sounds like an ancestor of the &lt;a href=\"cliffracer\"&gt;cliffracer&lt;/a&gt; of present day &lt;a href=\"Morrowind\"&gt;Morrowind&lt;/a&gt;. The treacherous cliff coastline sounds like the region around &lt;a href=\"Necrom\"&gt;Necrom&lt;/a&gt;, and the island of &lt;a href=\"Gorne\"&gt;Gorne&lt;/a&gt; may be where the nest of the \"bat lizard\" is. No creatures like that exist in eastern Morrowind to my knowledge at the present day.\nFragment Three:\nTracing Topal's movements, we see that he has skirted the edge of Morrowind and delved into southern Blackmarsh, seemingly determined to follow his waystone as best as he can. The swamp he is leaving is probably near present day &lt;a href=\"Gideon\"&gt;Gideon&lt;/a&gt;. Knowing what we now know about Topal's personality, we can understand his frustration in the bay between &lt;a href=\"Black%20Marsh\"&gt;Black Marsh&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Elsweyr\"&gt;Elsweyr&lt;/a&gt;.\nHere is a man who follows his orders explicitly, and knows that he should have been going south-east through river ways to reach &lt;a href=\"Firsthold\"&gt;Firsthold&lt;/a&gt;. Looking at his maps, we can see that he attempted to find passages through, as he has mapped out the Inner Sea of Morrowind, and several of the swampy tributaries of Black Marsh, no doubt being turned away by the disease and fierce &lt;a href=\"Argonia\"&gt;Argonia&lt;/a&gt;n tribes that dissuaded many other explorers after him.\nWith a modern map of Tamriel in hand, we can see that he makes the wrong choice in electing to go north-east instead of pushing southward. He could not have known then that what he perceived to be the endless mainland was only a jutting peninsula. He only knew that he had traveled too far southward already, and so he made a smart but incorrect decision to go up the river.\nIt is ironic that this great miscalculation would today bear his mark of history. The bay he thought was an endless ocean is now known as &lt;a href=\"Topal%20Bay\"&gt;Topal Bay&lt;/a&gt;, and the river that took him astray shares the name of his boat, the Niben River.\nFragment Four:\nThis last fragment is bittersweet for a number of reasons.\nWe know that this strange, friendly feathered people the Pilot encounters will be lost - in fact, this poem is the only one where mention is made of the bird creatures of Cyrodiil. The literacy that Topal gives them is evidently not enough to save them from their eventual fate, likely at the hands of the \"cat demons,\" who we may assume are ancient &lt;a href=\"Khajiit\"&gt;Khajiit&lt;/a&gt;i.\nWe know that Topal and his crew never find a route from the eight islands which are the modern day &lt;a href=\"Imperial%20City\"&gt;Imperial City&lt;/a&gt; through to the Iliac Bay. His maps tell the tale where this lost poem cannot.\nWe see his hand as he traces his route up the Niben to &lt;a href=\"Lake%20Rumare\"&gt;Lake Rumare&lt;/a&gt;; and, after attempting a few tributaries which do not lead him where he wants to go, we can imagine Topal's frustration -- and that of his long-suffering crew -- as they return back down the Niben to Topal Bay.\nThere, they evidently discovered their earlier mistake, for we see that they pass the peninsula of Elsweyr. Eventually they traveled along its coastline, past the shores of &lt;a href=\"Valenwood\"&gt;Valenwood&lt;/a&gt;, and eventually home. Usually epic tales end with a happy ending, but this one begins with one, and the means to which it was accomplished is lost.\nBesides the extraordinary bird creatures of present day Cyrodiil, we have caught glimpses of ancient orcs (perhaps), ancient &lt;a href=\"cliff-racers\"&gt;cliff-racers&lt;/a&gt;, ancient Argonians, and in this fragment, ancient Khajiit. Quite a history in a few lines of simple verse, all because a man failed to find his home, and took all the wrong turns to retrace his steps back."}

The Pasquiniel took the southern waystone, and must have sailed down toward &lt;a href=\"Pyandonea\"&gt;Pyandonea&lt;/a&gt;.

Reduced, or lack of, fatigue results in reduced accuracy and damage while fighting. Running, jumping, swimming, fighting, and casting &lt;a href=\"spells\"&gt;spells&lt;/a&gt; can reduce fatigue. Fatigue can be restored through &lt;a href=\"rest\"&gt;rest&lt;/a&gt;ing, spells, &lt;a href=\"potions\"&gt;potions&lt;/a&gt;, or simply standing still.\nBeing struck by &lt;a href=\"Hand-to-Hand\"&gt;Hand-to-Hand&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"attack\"&gt;attack&lt;/a&gt;s will also reduce fatigue. If fatigue is reduced to zero when the player is hit with a hand-to-hand attack, the player character is unable to attack and will fall to the ground.\nIn , fatigue is decreased by running or fighting and only regenerates while doing nothing. There are &lt;a href=\"Restore%20%28Spell%29\"&gt;Restore Fatigue&lt;/a&gt; enchanted items though, to counter this.\nRelated ingredients.\nUnless the &lt;a href=\"ingredient\"&gt;ingredient&lt;/a&gt; has one of the following fatigue-related effects as its first effect, the ingredient must be combined with related ingredients via &lt;a href=\"Alchemy\"&gt;Alchemy&lt;/a&gt; to make a &lt;a href=\"potion\"&gt;potion&lt;/a&gt; with that effect."}

Using those actions will result in the decrease of fatigue reserves. The &lt;a href=\"Hero%20of%20Kvatch\"&gt;Hero's&lt;/a&gt; fatigue will increase over time when not in use, and can recover even faster through a variety of means.\nMany different elements can play a role in the amount of fatigue the Hero has, such as level, &lt;a href=\"Birthsigns%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;birthsign&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Races%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;race&lt;/a&gt;, and various &lt;a href=\"Diseases%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;diseases&lt;/a&gt;. As the Hero's level increases, they can choose &lt;a href=\"Attributes%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;attributes&lt;/a&gt; that increase fatigue further.\nUsefulness.\nThe more fatigue the Hero has, the faster they can move. They can jump higher, and they can use power attacks more effectively. With a higher amount of fatigue, the more frequently the Hero can jump, and the longer they can sprint without running out.\nCombat uses.\nPower attacks use fatigue to deal more &lt;a href=\"Damage%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;damage&lt;/a&gt;. Depending on the Hero's skill level, it can stagger, knock down, or even &lt;a href=\"Paralyze%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;paralyze&lt;/a&gt; the enemy for a small amount of time. Using power attacks will require a fair amount of fatigue, and once the Hero runs out, the attack will have a lower chance of having an effect, besides increased damage.\nRestoring fatigue.\nThere are many ways to restore fatigue faster than just waiting for it naturally. Using certain &lt;a href=\"Spells%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;spells&lt;/a&gt;, drinking &lt;a href=\"Potions%20%28Oblivion%29%23Potion%20of%20Fatigue\"&gt;Potions of Fatigue&lt;/a&gt;, consuming &lt;a href=\"Ingredients%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;ingredients&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Rest%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;sleeping&lt;/a&gt; or resting can all restore the player's fatigue faster.\nPotions.\nThe Hero can consume potions that increase maximum fatigue or restore fatigue. These potions can be bought from a &lt;a href=\"Merchants%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;merchant&lt;/a&gt;, found as &lt;a href=\"Random%20Loot%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;random loot&lt;/a&gt;, or made using a &lt;a href=\"mortar%20and%20pestle\"&gt;mortar and pestle&lt;/a&gt;.

By the most depraved of motivations, the most despicable of tactics, and the most ungentlemanly of triumphs, the &lt;a href=\"kingdom%20of%20Daggerfall\"&gt;kingdom of Daggerfall&lt;/a&gt; changed the nature of warfare in the &lt;a href=\"Iliac%20Bay\"&gt;Iliac Bay&lt;/a&gt; and perhaps over all of &lt;a href=\"Tamriel\"&gt;Tamriel&lt;/a&gt;. In &lt;a href=\"Sentinel%20%28Daggerfall%29\"&gt;Sentinel&lt;/a&gt;, we call the recent carnage the Siege of Betony, but as the book of history is writ by the victors, let us speak instead of the War of Betony.\n&lt;a href=\"Redguards%20%28Daggerfall%29\"&gt;Redguards&lt;/a&gt; by their nature are a modest and practical people. We are not phlegmatic like the &lt;a href=\"Altmer%20%28Daggerfall%29\"&gt;High Elves&lt;/a&gt;, nor cowardly like the &lt;a href=\"Bosmer%20%28Daggerfall%29\"&gt;Wood Elves&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Khajiit%20%28Daggerfall%29\"&gt;Khajiiti&lt;/a&gt;. But what would infuriate and enrage the swaggering, vainglorious &lt;a href=\"Nords%20%28Daggerfall%29\"&gt;Nords&lt;/a&gt; and Bretons would not merit a shrug from a Redguard. Had any Breton kingdom possessed the little island of &lt;a href=\"Betony%20%28Region%29\"&gt;Betony&lt;/a&gt;, it would have been covetously guarded. Betony's trade would have been seriously restricted; its religion subjugated; its people bound by active and constant pledges and duties of vassalage. But Betony was not a Breton dominion. Betony was part of the Kingdom of Sentinel.\nKing &lt;a href=\"Lysandus\"&gt;Lysandus&lt;/a&gt;-- may the Old Ones continue to torment his soul for his wickedness! -- saw the prosperous island which is closer to his land than to Sentinel, and his black heart turned to avarice. Through threats, lies, acts of piracy and, finally, invasion, Daggerfall illegally took possession of the Island of Betony. His court sorceress, the Lady &lt;a href=\"Medora\"&gt;Medora&lt;/a&gt;, his enchantress mother, and other experienced counselors were horrified by the brutality of his campaign and begged him to abandon his tyrannical act of war. Gradually, all dissentors were removed from court. None but the ignorant and the warmongers remained.\nOur late king &lt;a href=\"Camaron\"&gt;Camaron&lt;/a&gt; tried to employ civil diplomacy with Daggerfall, but in the end, he made the former declaration of war. Daggerfall and Sentinel have fought many times in their two thousand years of coexistence, and Camaron knew the black magic and espionage the Bretons considered honest warfare. Never debasing the Sentinel character by duplicating the Breton villainy, Camaron knew best how to combat Lysandus. King Lysandus' knavish battle tactics were even more perfidious than his ancestors', and the war continue to rage until it began to involve more than Sentinel and Daggerfall.\nLord &lt;a href=\"Graddock\"&gt;Graddock&lt;/a&gt;, ruler of &lt;a href=\"Reich%20Gradkeep\"&gt;Reich Gradkeep&lt;/a&gt;, acted as concilator between Sentinel and Daggerfall, and eventually convinced both monarchs to meet and make peace. The ill-fated &lt;a href=\"Treaty%20of%20Gradkeep\"&gt;Treaty of Gradkeep&lt;/a&gt; began civilly; the terms of peace were discussed, agreed on, and set to paper. The terms were excessively generous. Camaron had agreed to give up some of his rights to Betony in order to placate the madness of Lysandus and bring peace back to the Iliac Bay. It was not until King Camaron read the Treaty he was about to sign that he realized the outrageous perfidy of the Bretons: the Treaty had actually been purposefully miswritten by the Daggerfall scribe in a desperate and ignominious attempt to trick Camaron into signing a contract different from the one to which he had agreed. The castle of Reich Gradkeep erupted into bloodbath, and the war continued.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Battle%20of%20Cryngaine%20Field\"&gt;Battle of Cryngaine Field&lt;/a&gt; was the tragic ending of the senseless war of attrition. The &lt;a href=\"Cryngaine%20Field\"&gt;Cryngaine Field&lt;/a&gt; is located in between the &lt;a href=\"Yeorth%20Burrowland\"&gt;Yeorth Burrowland&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Ravennian%20Forest\"&gt;Ravennian Forest&lt;/a&gt; where the armies of Sentinel and Daggerfall respectively made camp after the massacre at Reich Gradkeep. As the battle began, Daggerfall proved that she had some foul daedric magical tricks left by blinding the Redguard army with a wall of mist. Lysandus did not have the opportunity to gloat over his cozenage for long, for the sure arm of a Sentinel archer struck him in the throat even through the thick, swirling fog. Lysandus' son, &lt;a href=\"Gothryd\"&gt;Gothryd&lt;/a&gt;, who had spent the battle in lugubrious relaxation, was crowned without ceremony, and thereupon demanded a duel with King Camaron. Camaron was many years Gothryd's senior, and though a superior warrior, was exhausted from the endless warfare the boy king had been spared. Nevertheless, as a point of honor, our king agreed to the duel. The new king of Daggerfall, by dirty trick and black magic, managed to backstab our king before the duel ever began. Thus, the victor of Cryngaine Field, and the War of Betony, was Daggerfall.\nDaggerfall's wickedness continued even after her inglorious victory. While the widow queen of Sentinel, Her Majesty &lt;a href=\"Akorithi\"&gt;Akorithi&lt;/a&gt;, mourned and tried to mend her shattered lands, Gothryd demanded the Princess of Sentinel as a hostage of war. To save her homeland, the Princess &lt;a href=\"Aubk%27i\"&gt;Aubk'i&lt;/a&gt; agreed to leave Sentinel and even marry the murderer of her father. But we true Redguards of Sentinel know where her love and honor lies. The Queen of Daggerfall is the Princess of Sentinel first and foremost."}

However, the local Sixth-House's commander,\u00a0&lt;a href=\"Dagoth%20Gares\"&gt;Dagoth Gares&lt;/a&gt;, spared one soldier's life, so he could go back to the Fort and warn them about\u00a0&lt;a href=\"Dagoth%20Ur%20%28Character%29\"&gt;Dagoth Ur&lt;/a&gt;'s return.

Moreover, the cave is very dark. From the first area entered,\u00a0Carcass of the Saint, the Nerevarine must find their way to\u00a0Marowak's Spine\u00a0. There is an optional sub-location called\u00a0Tainted Marrow. Marowak's Spine leads to\u00a0Blackened Heart, and then, to the final location,\u00a0Soul's Rattle.

It was there that &lt;a href=\"General%20Decianus\"&gt;General Decianus&lt;/a&gt; and his &lt;a href=\"Imperial%20Legion\"&gt;Imperial Legion&lt;/a&gt; encountered the Dominion, leading to a bloody battle between the two factions. When Decianus was recalled to defend the &lt;a href=\"Imperial%20City\"&gt;Imperial City&lt;/a&gt;, his forces retreated to the east, and the Dominion captured Skaven. The Dominion was unable to follow Decianus into the Southern Alik'r, and so they remained in Skaven until they could fully recuperate. Unprepared to leave Hammerfell undefended, Decianus had discharged \"invalid\" soldiers, leaving them in the desert province. Eventually, that army reclaimed Skaven in &lt;a href=\"4E%20174\"&gt;4E 174&lt;/a&gt;. By then, the &lt;a href=\"Battle%20of%20the%20Red%20Ring\"&gt;Battle of the Red Ring&lt;/a&gt; had concluded, and the war was over."}

{"id": "84105", "revid": "26893431", "url": "https://elderscrolls.fandom.com/wiki?curid=84105", "title": "Skaal", "text": "The Skaal are a monotheistic society of &lt;a href=\"Nords\"&gt;Nords&lt;/a&gt; who inhabit the &lt;a href=\"Skaal%20Village\"&gt;Skaal Village&lt;/a&gt; on &lt;a href=\"Solstheim\"&gt;Solstheim&lt;/a&gt;. They are culturally and religiously different to their counterparts in Skyrim.\nCulture.\nWithin Skaal culture, the villagers are provided according to need, as the Skaal have little resources of their own. Because of this, theft is punished by exile or sacrifice to the wolves. Those who are exiled are to never be aided by the Skaal again, even in their most dire need. Contrary, when they are sacrificed it is believed the spirit is purified and reborn. When young men of the Skaal come of age, they are tasked with killing a draugr single-handedly to prove they are fit to be a man of the Skaal. The Skaal follow a couple of strict laws. The aforementioned being one of them; theft. The other being that a member of the Skaal should not attack another member, unless in self defense. The Skaal themselves have strict punishments for members of the Skaal committing these crimes, but if a non-Skaal is guilty, their punishment is always death.\nThe shaman of the Skaal is tasked with guiding and healing the fellow Skaal, while also keeping the traditions of the Skaal intact. This includes respecting nature and honoring the All-Maker.\nDraugr also hold a position within Skaal culture. The Skaal believe that the Draugr were once normal warriors who, after being trapped and becoming hungry on the island, resorted to cannibalism by eating their fallen comrades. The Skaal believe that the All-Maker cursed them with undeath in an ever-lasting search for more flesh to consume.\nAnother part of Skaal culture involves the Ristaag. The Ristaag is a ceremony in which the land is blessed and cleansed, and is only performed rarely. In order to summon the beasts needed in the Ristaag, the Skaal use the &lt;a href=\"Totem%20of%20Claw%20and%20Fang%20%28Item%29\"&gt;Totem of Claw and Fang&lt;/a&gt;. After acquiring the Totem, the members of the Skaal summon beasts and perform the ritual hunt to please the All-Maker by showing him the gratitude of the Skaal for his gifts. The Ristaag takes place around nightfall, and if the Ristaag fails, or does not succeed by daybreak, the All-Maker is displeased with the Skaal. To officially end the Ristaag, the heart of the &lt;a href=\"Spirit%20Bear%20%28Bloodmoon%29\"&gt;Spirit Bear&lt;/a&gt; must be taken to the Skaal shaman.\nIn regards to hunting, the Skaal follow a specific mindset. First they ask themselves if they need to kill the animal they are hunting, as the Oneness of the land is preserved by only taking what a hunter needs. As such, the Skaal do not hunt for sport, but solely to survive, as they consider each animal of the land to have a right to live as they themselves desire. When the Skaal have obtained what they need, they thank the beast for its gifts, as the less the Skaal disturb the beasts of the land, the more they honor the All-Maker. The Skaal primarily hunt deer, bears, and horker, as these animals provide the most in what the Skaal requires in fur and meat. As of the Fourth Era, the Skaal also hunt the Netch, a creature native to Morrowind. The Netch provides the Skaal with meat, bones, and honor to the hunters who kill it. Wolves are also hunted occasionally, when their numbers form a threat to the Skaal Village. Hunting parties for large game are led by the First Hunter, who is the most skilled hunter of the Skaal. Similarly, when the Skaal collect firewood they try to look for the wood of dead trees, as this harms nature the least. The Skaal are traditionally peaceful, and will only resort to violence as a last resort.\nReligion.\n&lt;a href=\"All-Maker\"&gt;The All-Maker&lt;/a&gt;.\nOnly one god is present in Skaal religion, the All-Maker, who the Skaal consider the maker of all things. Upon death, the Skaal believe that the soul is returned to the All-Maker, and the All-Maker then sends it back to the world as a new creature. As such, the Skaal believe that death is not the end, but rather, the start of a new journey in life.\nThe Oneness of the land is believed by the Skaal to be what provides them with power. The Oneness of Solstheim is the balance of the land, the trees, waters, wolf, and bear. This balance is ensured through the Standing Stones of the island. As such, the Skaal attempt to live in harmony with the land, taking only what they consider necessary. Alongside this, the material known as Stalhrim is considered sacred by the Skaal. For a long time, the Skaal who used this material for crafting were branded as outcasts, as the Skaal did not value its practical use over the holy connection it had been given. In the Fourth Era, however, the smithing of Stalhrim was considered an ancient tradition of the Skaal, and was an art the Skaal held sacred.\nBears have a symbolic meaning within the Skaal. They are considered sacred creatures with which the All-Maker has blessed the Skaal, as they represent the strength of a warrior. Some of the Skaal hold the power and magical knowledge to summon bears to fight by their side.\nWolves also have a symbolic meaning within the Skaal, as they are fast and agile, as well as both careful and clever hunters. Because of this, the Skaal consider them one of the most blessed of the All-Maker's creations. Some Skaal are given the knowledge to summon a wolf by the shaman of the Skaal.\n&lt;a href=\"Daedra\"&gt;Daedra&lt;/a&gt;.\n&lt;a href=\"Hircine\"&gt;Hircine&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe Skaal hold an ancient prophecy, which for a long time was considered nothing but myth. This prophecy is known as the Bloodmoon Prophecy. During this prophecy, the moon would turn as red as blood, and wolves would walk like men on the land. There are three steps which lead up to the Bloodmoon Prophecy coming true.\nThe first step is the \"Fire From the Eye of Glass,\" a reference to Lake Fjalding and the large fire which burns atop of it. This is followed up by the \"Tide of Woe,\" in which countless horkers end up dead along the shores of Solstheim without a proper explanation. The final part of the prophecy is the \"Bloodmoon\", during which one of the Moons of Nirn turns red with the blood of the Hunter's prey, following which the Hunter's Game takes place.\nThe Hunter's Game varies with each era. Once Hircine and his werewolves hunted on entire tribes of men in &lt;a href=\"Hircine%27s%20Hunting%20Grounds\"&gt;Hircine's Hunting Grounds&lt;/a&gt;. Those who survived the initial hunt had to face Hircine himself. On another occasion, Hircine had only taken one man to be his prey. According to legend, if the prey manages to survive the passing of the Bloodmoon, Hircine returns to his realm for another era.\nAside from the Bloodmoon Prophecy and werewolves, the Skaal also shun Hircine for the creation of &lt;a href=\"Werebear\"&gt;Werebear&lt;/a&gt;s, which they consider twisted beasts, as normal bears are seen as noble and great creatures, where as Werebears are considered to be Hircine's attempts at defiling the creations of the All-Maker.\n&lt;a href=\"Hermaeus%20Mora\"&gt;Hermaeus Mora&lt;/a&gt;.\nHermaeus Mora, who is also known as &lt;a href=\"Herma-Mora\"&gt;Herma-Mora&lt;/a&gt; by the Skaal, is the Demon of Knowledge and an enemy of the Skaal. For many generations, the Daedric Prince has tried to obtain the secrets of the Skaal, only to fail on every occasion, excluding the Fourth Era, when the Skaal were forced to give up their secrets in order to allow the &lt;a href=\"Last%20Dragonborn\"&gt;Last Dragonborn&lt;/a&gt; to learn the &lt;a href=\"Bend%20Will\"&gt;Bend Will&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Thu%27um\"&gt;Shout&lt;/a&gt;. The secrets themselves were said to have been given to the Skaal by the All-Maker himself, and was handed down from shaman to shaman, and consisted of knowing how to talk to the wind and how to listen to the earth.\nThe Adversary.\nThe Adversary is known for his delight in tormenting the All-Maker and the Skaal, and for his many aspects. His aspects are the unholy beasts and the incurable plague, the Skaal also recognize the Greedy Man and &lt;a href=\"Thartaag\"&gt;Thartaag&lt;/a&gt; the World-Devourer as aspects of the Adversary. He is the Adversary of the Skaal, and implied to be an aspect of Hircine, if not Hircine himself. When the Skaal grow lazy and take the land and the All-Maker's gifts for granted, the Adversary takes shape, as the Adversary is fond of disrupting the Skaal. If the Skaal neglect the All-Maker for too long, the Adversary is able to take away the gifts of the All-Maker. As the Greedy Man, the Adversary is able to take away the gifts of the Standing Stones of Solstheim, until one of the Skaal comes to reclaim them.\nTo cleanse the &lt;a href=\"Water%20Stone\"&gt;Water Stone&lt;/a&gt;, the Skaal member has to swim westward and follow &lt;a href=\"The%20Swimmer\"&gt;The Swimmer&lt;/a&gt; to &lt;a href=\"Stahlman%27s%20Gorge\"&gt;Stahlman's Gorge&lt;/a&gt;, where the &lt;a href=\"Waters%20of%20Life\"&gt;Waters of Life&lt;/a&gt; are found. The Skaal member has to retrieve this water and return it to the Water Stone in order to cleanse it. Upon cleansing it, the All-Maker announces the oceans will bear fruit again and thirst will be quenched.\nTo cleanse the &lt;a href=\"Earth%20Stone\"&gt;Earth Stone&lt;/a&gt;, the member has to find the &lt;a href=\"Cave%20of%20Hidden%20Music\"&gt;Cave of Hidden Music&lt;/a&gt;, where they have to play tunes which are identical to the ones created within the cave. Following the completion of this, the earth of Solstheim is rich again, and capable of bearing life.\nIn order to cleanse the &lt;a href=\"Beast%20Stone\"&gt;Beast Stone&lt;/a&gt;, the member is tasked with finding the Good Beast and ease its suffering. The beast will have been attacked by a ranged opponent, and the Skaal member has to remove the arrow and treat its wounds. When the Beast Stone is cleansed, the beasts of the land work with the Skaal again, providing them with meat, fur, and even protection from enemies.\nFor the cleansing of the &lt;a href=\"Tree%20Stone\"&gt;Tree Stone&lt;/a&gt;, the member has to collect the seeds of the First Tree and replant them after they were stolen. Upon successfully doing so, the plants will return to the land and provide shade and nourishment for the Skaal.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Sun%20Stone\"&gt;Sun Stone&lt;/a&gt; is cleansed through the liberation of the light trapped in the &lt;a href=\"Halls%20of%20Penumbra\"&gt;Halls of Penumbra&lt;/a&gt;, where many &lt;a href=\"Grahl\"&gt;Grahl&lt;/a&gt; reside. The Skaal member has to kill the &lt;a href=\"Lightkeeper%20Grahl\"&gt;Lightkeeper Grahl&lt;/a&gt; and use its &lt;a href=\"Flaming%20Eye%20of%20the%20Lightkeeper\"&gt;flaming eye&lt;/a&gt; to break the wall of ice keeping the light at bay. After doing this, the All-Maker rewards the Skaal with a return of warmth and light.\nThe final Standing Stone is the &lt;a href=\"Wind%20Stone\"&gt;Wind Stone&lt;/a&gt;. In order to cleanse this Stone, the Greedy Man's bag has to be opened, allowing the stolen Winds to return to the land. Upon cleansing this last stone and defeating the Greedy Man, the All-Maker congratulates the Skaal member, but also informs them that the Skaal should continue to honor nature.\nHistory.\n&lt;a href=\"Merethic%20Era\"&gt;Merethic Era&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe Skaal were believed to have settled Solstheim during the Merethic Era. Back then, they still followed the Dragon Cult, and shared the culture of Skyrim's Nords. When the Dragon Priest known as Miraak attempted to usurp the Dragon Cult, he was defeated by &lt;a href=\"Vahlok%20the%20Jailor\"&gt;Vahlok the Jailor&lt;/a&gt;, who would then rule Solstheim at the command of the Dragons. It is believed that the Skaal developed their own distinct culture from the Nords of Skyrim due to their seperation from the mainland.\n&lt;a href=\"First%20Era\"&gt;First Era&lt;/a&gt;.\nDuring the &lt;a href=\"War%20of%20the%20First%20Council\"&gt;War of the First Council&lt;/a&gt;, in which the Nords of Skyrim were pushed out of &lt;a href=\"Morrowind\"&gt;Morrowind&lt;/a&gt;. Many Nords fell in battle, and those who could not be returned to Skyrim were brought to Solstheim to be buried. The Skaal then used magicks on the Nordic tombs, to protect them from grave robbers, and to keep the corpses from turning worse. It is said the Skaal drew the magic from the land itself, and encased the bodies in ice, which would be known as &lt;a href=\"Stalhrim\"&gt;Stalhrim&lt;/a&gt;.\n&lt;a href=\"Third%20Era\"&gt;Third Era&lt;/a&gt;.\nIn 3E 327, part of the Skaal would abandon the Village to create their own meadhall, known as &lt;a href=\"Thirsk%20Mead%20Hall\"&gt;Thirsk Mead Hall&lt;/a&gt;. The people of Thirsk wanted to kill as they pleased, and be free to worship who they desired.\nDuring the late-Third Era, the Skaal disapproved of &lt;a href=\"Fort%20Frostmoth\"&gt;Fort Frostmoth&lt;/a&gt;, the Imperial Fort on the isle. When &lt;a href=\"Captain%20Falx%20Carius\"&gt;Captain Falx Carius&lt;/a&gt; was captured due to &lt;a href=\"Hircine%27s%20Hunt\"&gt;Hircine's Hunt&lt;/a&gt;, the Legionnaires at &lt;a href=\"Fort%20Frostmoth\"&gt;Fort Frostmoth&lt;/a&gt; suspected the Skaal knew more, as &lt;a href=\"werewolf\"&gt;werewolves&lt;/a&gt; were involved in the capture of the Captain. When the &lt;a href=\"Nerevarine\"&gt;Nerevarine&lt;/a&gt; arrived at the Skaal Village, &lt;a href=\"Tharsten%20Heart-Fang\"&gt;Tharsten Heart-Fang&lt;/a&gt;, the leader of the Skaal, assured him that the Skaal were not involved.\nThe Imperials had been cutting down the trees and digging the &lt;a href=\"Raw%20Ebony\"&gt;ebony ore&lt;/a&gt; of the island, and because of this the Oneness of the land was disturbed, which provides the Skaal with strength. Additionally, the Imperials did not replant trees for the ones they chopped down, killed the wildlife without concern, and for this reason the Skaal considered them shortsighted and foolish.\nTo restore the balance in the land, the Nerevarine had to visit the six Standing Stones of the land, one for each of the gifts of the All-Maker. Following the successful completion of this first task, the Heart-Fang was convinced the heart of the Nerevarine was with the Skaal, but desired his mind to be with them as well. As such, he tasked the Nerevarine with investigating a crime, as &lt;a href=\"Engar%20Ice-Mane\"&gt;Engar Ice-Mane&lt;/a&gt; was accused of stealing the furs of &lt;a href=\"Rigmor%20Halfhand\"&gt;Rigmor Halfhand&lt;/a&gt;. It would later turn out that Rigmor himself was responsible, due to a love he had for &lt;a href=\"Risi%20Ice-Mane\"&gt;Risi Ice-Mane&lt;/a&gt;, the wife of Engar.\nFollowing this, the Nerevarine had to prove one final thing to the Skaal, and that was his strength. The Nerevarine was to meet the current shaman of the Skaal, &lt;a href=\"Korst%20Wind-Eye\"&gt;Korst Wind-Eye&lt;/a&gt;, at &lt;a href=\"Lake%20Fjalding\"&gt;Lake Fjalding&lt;/a&gt; for this new task. At the lake, the shaman had discovered the lake had been disturbed, as a large fire had broken out atop the lake itself. The Skaal leader suspected a &lt;a href=\"Draugr\"&gt;Draugr&lt;/a&gt; Lord, known as &lt;a href=\"Draugr%20Lord%20Aesliip\"&gt;Aesliip&lt;/a&gt;, was responsible for the fire, while the shaman believed it to be a sign of the &lt;a href=\"Bloodmoon%20Prophecy\"&gt;Bloodmoon Prophecy&lt;/a&gt;.\nAesliip would turn out to be related to the event, but not the cause. He was housed under the lake, where, unlike the other draugr who desired flesh, he sought to perform a task. Aesliip had once been a mage of the Skaal, but when he delved into the black arts, he was cast out. Aesliip would discover that a group of &lt;a href=\"Dire%20Frost%20Atronach\"&gt;Dire Frost Atronach&lt;/a&gt;s were planning to destroy the Skaal, and remove life from the island. When the Skaal ignored Aesliip's warnings, the mage used his magics to created a barrier within the ice to keep the Atronachs from breaking free. Aesliip would eventually end up dead, though if the Atronachs were defeated or not is never stated. Following the death of Aesliip, however, the lake still burned, and the Nerevarine was tasked with returning to the Skaal Village.\nNot long afterwards, werewolves would attack the village, and in the chaos, Tharsten Heart-Fang was taken away by them. While the Nerevarine aided in fighting off the werewolves, he became infected with an early stage of lycanthrophy, and had to be cured in order to continue working alongside the Skaal. Upon curing the disease, the Nerevarine was known as Blodskaal, a blood friend.\nWith these bad events happening, it was decided the Ristaag would have to take place to please the All-Maker. For this event, however, the Totem of Claw and Fang was required, an item which had been stolen from the Skaal years prior. Upon successfully returning the Totem, the Nerevarine was rewarded with the ability to summon a wolf. Shortly after, the Nerevarine was tasked with aiding in the Ristaag, a traditional hunt of the Skaal people used only rarely and in times of great need.\nUpon the completion of the Ristaag, the Nerevarine would be taken away by werewolves to participate in the Hunter's Game. Here, the Imperial Captain Falx Carius, the Frost Giant &lt;a href=\"Karstaag\"&gt;Karstaag&lt;/a&gt;, and Tharsten Heart-Fang were all encountered. Falx Carius and the Nerevarine collaborated to fight against the first level of werewolves, though Falx would leave the Nerevarine to continue on to the second level, as he would ensure no werewolves would follow. Tharsten would be found on the second level, however, the leader of the Skaal turned out to be the Champion of Hircine for many generations, and had been granted eternal life through &lt;a href=\"Hircine%27s%20Ring%20%28Bloodmoon%29\"&gt;Hircine's Ring&lt;/a&gt;. The Nerevarine would defeat Karstaag and one of the three aspects of the Hunt, effectively ending the Bloodmoon Prophecy, resulting in the werewolves dwindling in numbers, the fire in Lake Fjalding ceasing to burn, and the return of the Horkers. The Nerevarine was suspected to have been a potentially good replacement for Heart-Fang, however, because they were not Skaal-born they could not lead the village. Because of this, Korst Wind-Eye, the shaman, would guide the Skaal until the All-Maker appointed a new leader.\nWhile the Bloodmoon Prophecy was ongoing, &lt;a href=\"Carnius%20Magius\"&gt;Carnius Magius&lt;/a&gt;, the local factor of the &lt;a href=\"East%20Empire%20Company\"&gt;East Empire Company&lt;/a&gt;, had sent out mercenaries portrayed as the Skaal to attack the settlement of &lt;a href=\"Raven%20Rock\"&gt;Raven Rock&lt;/a&gt;, in order to make the investors pull out of the venture, allowing Carnius to take all the Stalhrim.\n&lt;a href=\"Fourth%20Era\"&gt;Fourth Era&lt;/a&gt;.\nDuring &lt;a href=\"4E%20201\"&gt;4E 201&lt;/a&gt;, the First &lt;a href=\"Dragonborn\"&gt;Dragonborn&lt;/a&gt; known as &lt;a href=\"Miraak\"&gt;Miraak&lt;/a&gt; was attempting to cross back over to Tamriel. He did this through corrupting the Standing Stones of the land. At this time, &lt;a href=\"Fanari%20Strong-Voice\"&gt;Fanari Strong-Voice&lt;/a&gt; led the Skaal. Through the corruption of Miraak, most of the Skaal were pulled to working on the Stones to increase the influence of Miraak. &lt;a href=\"Storn%20Crag-Strider\"&gt;Storn Crag-Strider&lt;/a&gt;, the shaman of the Skaal, aided the &lt;a href=\"Last%20Dragonborn\"&gt;Last Dragonborn&lt;/a&gt; by pointing them to &lt;a href=\"Neloth%20%28Dragonborn%29\"&gt;Neloth&lt;/a&gt; in order to learn more about &lt;a href=\"Black%20Book\"&gt;Black Book&lt;/a&gt;s, which were related to Miraak.\nAfter learning more about the Black Books and means to stop Miraak, &lt;a href=\"Hermaeus%20Mora\"&gt;Hermaeus Mora&lt;/a&gt; demanded the secrets of the Skaal in return for his knowledge on the &lt;a href=\"Bend%20Will\"&gt;Bend Will&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Thu%27um\"&gt;Shout&lt;/a&gt;. Storn accepted to give up the secrets of the Skaal to Hermaeus Mora, but Mora had tricked the shaman, as the Daedric Prince killed him in the process of obtaining the secrets.\nAt the same time, the smith of the Skaal, known as &lt;a href=\"Baldor%20Iron-Shaper\"&gt;Baldor Iron-Shaper&lt;/a&gt;, had gone missing. &lt;a href=\"Deor%20Woodcutter\"&gt;Deor Woodcutter&lt;/a&gt;, another member of the Skaal, had seen two &lt;a href=\"elves\"&gt;elves&lt;/a&gt; near the village dragging something, but assumed they had just been hunters. These elves would turn out to be members of the Thalmor, who had been sent out to obtain the secrets in smithing Stalhrim, though it is unknown if they succeeded in obtaining Stalhrim weapons and armor.\nDuring the late-Fourth Era, the numbers of the Skaal were dwindling. Because of the harsh existence in such an extreme environment, and the new threat of the ashfall from &lt;a href=\"Vvardenfell\"&gt;Vvardenfell&lt;/a&gt; taking its toll on the plants and animals upon which the Skaal depend for their daily survival, it is possible that their unique way of life will be lost forever in a few centuries, and what few Skaal remain by then might have no other choice but to reintegrate into Skyrim and rejoin their Nord cousins."}

The road to the Village is perilous since a typical traveler would have to deal with a series of Ash Storms and Blizzards to even see the Village from a distance. The Skaal are very unaware of outside problems because of how isolated the village is from the mainland. The Village has no walls and is merely a few houses surrounding a well and the &lt;a href=\"Greathall\"&gt;Greathall&lt;/a&gt;. The Village is a very simple one.\nHistory.\n&lt;a href=\"Third%20Era\"&gt;Third Era&lt;/a&gt;.\nHircine's Hunt under the Bloodmoon.\nIn &lt;a href=\"3E%20427\"&gt;3E 427&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"East%20Empire%20Company\"&gt;East Empire Company&lt;/a&gt; rediscovered the island of Solstheim and established &lt;a href=\"Fort%20Frostmoth\"&gt;Fort Frostmoth&lt;/a&gt; on the southern coast. By this time, the only settlements on Solstheim were the Skaal Village, &lt;a href=\"Thirsk\"&gt;Thirsk&lt;/a&gt;, and several unnamed &lt;a href=\"Riekling\"&gt;Riekling&lt;/a&gt; camps. In the same year, the &lt;a href=\"Bloodmoon%20Prophecy\"&gt;Bloodmoon Prophecy&lt;/a&gt; had occurred on Solstheim and &lt;a href=\"Hircine\"&gt;Hircine&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"Daedric%20Prince\"&gt;Daedric Prince&lt;/a&gt; of the Hunt took the three greatest heroes on Solstheim. There was &lt;a href=\"Karstaag\"&gt;Karstaag&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"Castle%20Karstaag\"&gt;Castle Karstaag&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"General%20Falx%20Carius\"&gt;General Falx Carius&lt;/a&gt; of Frostmoth, and &lt;a href=\"Tharsten%20Heart-Fang\"&gt;Tharsten Heart-Fang&lt;/a&gt; of the Skaal. The three along with the &lt;a href=\"Nerevarine\"&gt;Nerevarine&lt;/a&gt; took place in the Hunt and the outcome of the Hunt is unknown. Heart-Fang's fate is also undetermined.\n&lt;a href=\"Fourth%20Era\"&gt;Fourth Era&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe Return of Miraak &amp; The Last Dragonborn.\nIn &lt;a href=\"4E%20201\"&gt;4E 201&lt;/a&gt;, a group of Cultists gathered together to initiate the return of &lt;a href=\"Miraak\"&gt;Miraak&lt;/a&gt;, one of the original &lt;a href=\"Dragonborn\"&gt;Dragonborn&lt;/a&gt; that was eventually cast to &lt;a href=\"Apocrypha\"&gt;Apocrypha&lt;/a&gt; to become &lt;a href=\"Hermaeus%20Mora\"&gt;Hermaeus Mora&lt;/a&gt;'s Champion. The &lt;a href=\"All-Maker%20Stones\"&gt;All-Maker Stones&lt;/a&gt; that dot the island were used as a base for temples dedicated to Miraak and the people of Solstheim were hypnotized into building these unholy monuments. The &lt;a href=\"Wind%20Stone\"&gt;Wind Stone&lt;/a&gt; was used by the Cultists to control the Skaal and to build the temple. The local shaman, &lt;a href=\"Storn%20Crag-Strider\"&gt;Storn Crag-Strider&lt;/a&gt;, created a barrier protecting the few remaining citizens in Skaal. The &lt;a href=\"Last%20Dragonborn\"&gt;Last Dragonborn&lt;/a&gt; arrived into town after defeating the Skaal at the &lt;a href=\"Temple%20of%20Miraak\"&gt;Temple of Miraak&lt;/a&gt;, Storn asked the Dragonborn to travel to &lt;a href=\"Saering%27s%20Watch\"&gt;Saering's Watch&lt;/a&gt; to learn the ultimate power to defeat Miraak.\nFreeing Solstheim; The Summit of Apocrypha.\nThe Dragonborn learned the words of the &lt;a href=\"Bend%20Will\"&gt;Bend Will&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Thu%27um\"&gt;Thu'um&lt;/a&gt; and used it to dispel the hypnotic effects of the All-Maker Stones. Miraak's influence began to dwindle and was vulnerable enough to finally perish. The Dragonborn required all three words of the Shout to successfully defeat Miraak but Hermaeus Mora had the final word, he gave the Dragonborn the power in exchange for Storn Crag-Strider's life. The Dovahkiin traveled to Apocrypha to finally defeat Miraak at the Summit of Apocrypha."}

He serves as Jarl of &lt;a href=\"The%20Pale\"&gt;The Pale&lt;/a&gt; from his seat in &lt;a href=\"Dawnstar%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Dawnstar&lt;/a&gt;.\nBackground.\nAs Jarl of &lt;a href=\"Dawnstar%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Dawnstar&lt;/a&gt;, he resides within &lt;a href=\"The%20White%20Hall\"&gt;The White Hall&lt;/a&gt; with a number of servants and counselors, including his &lt;a href=\"housecarl\"&gt;housecarl&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Jod\"&gt;Jod&lt;/a&gt;, his servant, &lt;a href=\"Bulfrek\"&gt;Bulfrek&lt;/a&gt;, and the Court Wizard, &lt;a href=\"Madena\"&gt;Madena&lt;/a&gt;. His family, the Felgeifs, have been Jarls of Dawnstar for generations. Skald the Elder has ruled Dawnstar for over thirty-five years.\nPersonality.\nSkald is a grumpy, elderly man. He has a particular distaste for the &lt;a href=\"Empire%20of%20Tamriel\"&gt;Empire&lt;/a&gt; and often argues with two &lt;a href=\"Imperial%20Legion%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Legion&lt;/a&gt; veterans living in Dawnstar. He also has a fascination with the &lt;a href=\"Civil%20War\"&gt;Civil War&lt;/a&gt; and respects &lt;a href=\"Ulfric%20Stormcloak%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Ulfric Stormcloak&lt;/a&gt; greatly. Although he wishes for all the citizens of his hold to fight for Ulfric, at the same time he looks down upon those who have lesser \"stature\" who still wish to fight, such as his servant, Bulfrek.\nPolitical views.\nHe is one of three Jarls to openly and actively support the &lt;a href=\"Stormcloaks\"&gt;Stormcloaks&lt;/a&gt; and Jarl Ulfric. Skald also believes that the &lt;a href=\"Dragons%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Dragons&lt;/a&gt; have returned because &lt;a href=\"Talos\"&gt;Talos&lt;/a&gt; has become angry with the Empire for banning his worship, and that they will disappear when the Stormcloaks push the Empire out of &lt;a href=\"Skyrim\"&gt;Skyrim&lt;/a&gt;. Few of his citizens share his zeal for the cause, however, with most either remaining neutral or preferring the more reasonable and stoic Brina Merilis.\nInteractions.\nFirst encounter.\nNear the White Hall, upon first entering Dawnstar, he can be seen arguing with one of the town's most important residents, &lt;a href=\"Brina%20Merilis\"&gt;Brina Merilis&lt;/a&gt;, and rebuking her housecarl &lt;a href=\"Horik%20Halfhand\"&gt;Horik Halfhand&lt;/a&gt; for wearing &lt;a href=\"Imperial%20Armor%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Imperial Legion Armor&lt;/a&gt;, branding the act as treasonous. He goes as far as threatening to execute them and seems to think of them as Imperial spies.\n&lt;a href=\"Waking%20Nightmare\"&gt;Waking Nightmare&lt;/a&gt;.\nIf &lt;a href=\"Erandur\"&gt;Erandur&lt;/a&gt; is not spoken to directly at &lt;a href=\"Windpeak%20Inn\"&gt;Windpeak Inn&lt;/a&gt;, Skald the Elder informs the &lt;a href=\"Last%20Dragonborn\"&gt;Dragonborn&lt;/a&gt; of nightmares citizens are having. He sends the Dragonborn to speak with Erandur, a priest of &lt;a href=\"Mara\"&gt;Mara&lt;/a&gt;, culminating in the sack of &lt;a href=\"Vaermina\"&gt;Vaermina&lt;/a&gt;'s shrine at &lt;a href=\"Nightcaller%20Temple\"&gt;Nightcaller Temple&lt;/a&gt;.\n&lt;a href=\"Bounty%20Quests\"&gt;Bounty&lt;/a&gt;.\nHe provides &lt;a href=\"radiant%20quests\"&gt;radiant quests&lt;/a&gt; for &lt;a href=\"Bounty%20Quests\"&gt;bounties&lt;/a&gt;.\n&lt;a href=\"Thane%20of%20the%20Pale\"&gt;Thane of the Pale&lt;/a&gt;.\nHe may also dub the Dragonborn &lt;a href=\"Thane%20%28Title%29\"&gt;Thane&lt;/a&gt; if he is known by the people throughout the hold. This is achieved by completing Waking Nightmare and completing tasks for the people of &lt;a href=\"The%20Pale\"&gt;The Pale&lt;/a&gt;.\nCivil War.\nIf the Dragonborn sides with the Empire during the Civil War, or if &lt;a href=\"Markarth%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Markarth&lt;/a&gt; is traded for Dawnstar during &lt;a href=\"Season%20Unending\"&gt;Season Unending&lt;/a&gt;, Skald, his housecarl Jod, and his servant Bulfrek are exiled to the &lt;a href=\"Palace%20of%20the%20Kings\"&gt;Palace of the Kings&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Windhelm%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Windhelm&lt;/a&gt;. Brina Merilis, an Imperial Legionnaire, replaces him as Jarl of Dawnstar.\n&lt;a href=\"Kill%20the%20Giant%20%28Jarl%29\"&gt;Kill the Giant&lt;/a&gt;.\nSkald the Elder asks the Dragonborn to kill a &lt;a href=\"Giant%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;giant&lt;/a&gt;.\n&lt;a href=\"Heljarchen%20Hall\"&gt;Purchase land in the Pale&lt;/a&gt;.\nIf has been installed, Skald can offer the Dragonborn the deed for &lt;a href=\"Heljarchen%20Hall\"&gt;Heljarchen Hall&lt;/a&gt;, provided the Dragonborn has completed the quests \"Waking Nightmare\" and \"Kill the Giant\" for him.\nDialogue.\n\"I've been in charge of Dawnstar for over 35 years.\"\n\"Don't bother me again unless it's important.\"\nConversations.\n&lt;a href=\"Brina%20Merilis\"&gt;Brina&lt;/a&gt;: \"Divines sakes, Skald, who do you think we're threatening with our old war wounds? We're not soldiers anymore.\"\nSkald: \"\"Your man &lt;a href=\"Horik%20Halfhand\"&gt;Horik&lt;/a&gt; is wearing his &lt;a href=\"Imperial%20Armor%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Legion armor&lt;/a&gt;.

I catch you sending one letter to &lt;a href=\"General%20Tullius%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;General Tullius&lt;/a&gt;, I'll have you both executed.\"\"\n&lt;a href=\"Bulfrek\"&gt;Bulfrek&lt;/a&gt;: \"Skald, if you don't mind, sir, I have a request.\"\nSkald: \"You, have a request of me, Bulfrek? [laughter] This should be interesting.\"\nBulfrek: \"Well, I was thinking, sir, with the war going on and all. Maybe, I could enlist? Fight the Imperials?\"\nSkald: \"\"A servant? Enlisting in the &lt;a href=\"Stormcloaks\"&gt;Stormcloaks&lt;/a&gt;? [laughter] Ah, Bulfrek, that's why I like having you about. You're always good for a laugh.\"\"\nBulfrek: \"Uh, yes sir. That's me. Your oafish servant.\"\nSkald: \"Bulfrek, I have an order of swords and armor from the local blacksmith coming here. I need every piece polished to a fine shine.\"\nBulfrek: \"Yes, my Jarl. We could hardly waste anyone else's precious time on such a tedious task.\"\nSkald: \"Exactly, Bulfrek. You always know your place.\"\n&lt;a href=\"Jod\"&gt;Jod&lt;/a&gt;: \"My Jarl, I have concerns about the safety of Dawnstar.\"\nSkald: \"Safety? Don't I have you to handle the town's safety? What is this about, Jod?\"\nJod: \"You keep pledging more and more of our guard to the frontlines. The way this is going, we won't be able to defend our own borders.\"\nSkald: \"Nonsense. The best place for our men is driving the Imperials back. I will ensure that men from Dawnstar get every opportunity for glory.\"\nJod: \"Glory is meaningless if they have no home to return to. I urge you to lower our commitments to the front until I'm sure we're safe.\"\nSkald: \"I won't have you rob our soldiers of their chance to drive out the Empire. I'm done discussing this, Jod.\"\nSkald: \"We are poised for glory, Jod. The Empire will never take Dawnstar while every last man, woman, and child here draws breathe!\"\nJod: \"With respect, Jarl. You can't ask everyone to throw themselves against trained Legionnaires. Let's leave the fighting to the Stormcloaks.\"\nSkald: \"You're right. Why dilute the glory with too many souls fighting over it? We'll drive out the Empire and be celebrated as heroes when we win.\"\nJod: \"If we win. This war is going to drag on for years. I can feel it. We need to prepare for a long struggle ahead.\"\nSkald: \"Enough of your dire predictions! We will talk about this another time.\"\n&lt;a href=\"Madena\"&gt;Madena&lt;/a&gt;: \"Skald, I've been meaning to ask you for a leave of absence. I wish to return to High Rock until this war is over.\"\nSkald: \"You wish to leave now? In Skyrim's moment of triumph, just before we cast off the yoke of Imperial rule?\"\nMadena: \"Yes, that's exactly what I'm asking. I'm not a Nord, I'm a Breton, and I have no wish to fight this war.\"\nSkald: \"I don't think so, Madena. There will be no deserters in this hold, and that's final.\"\nSkald: \"Madena, can we count on your spells to assist us in this war? The Empire is bound to bring their battlemages against us.\"\nMadena: \"I told you before, Skald, I have no interest in taking sides in this war. I've no desire to be killed.\"\nSkald: \"What good is a court mage if she refuses to fight? Where's your sense of duty?\"\nMadena: \"When I came here, my only duties were to cure crop diseases and occasionally light a bonfire on holidays. I didn't sign up to kill.\"\nSkald: \"Fine, but this isn't over Madena. We'll talk again.\""}

Mounted on a telescoping rod, the Identifier sends out pulses of detection magic to survey objects of interest and search within specific parameters.\n&lt;This was the only noteworthy device in the standard design. Unless you're fascinated by scent interpreters.&gt;\nSkeevaton Modification\nSkeevatons are found throughout &lt;a href=\"Clockwork%20City%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Clockwork City&lt;/a&gt;, even in extremely hazardous environments. Tinkerers have managed to get around the weaknesses of the fabricant's diminutive size by incorporating some offensive and defensive devices.\nGear Shifting: One of the most common modifications I've encountered involves a secondary set of motility gears meant to increase the skeevaton's speed in short bursts. Certainly useful when they need to traverse the inner workings of active machinery.\n&lt;Simple enough, but weight will be a limiting factor.&gt;\nEnergy Absorption: Skeevatons are sometimes fitted with a micro-&lt;a href=\"magicka\"&gt;magicka&lt;/a&gt; condenser allowing them to temporarily store and transport energy without a charged soul gem. The practical uses for this are theoretically limitless, but retaining a powerful magical charge provides some defensive uses as well.\nDischarge Energy: A fully charged micro-magicka condenser can release its volatile payload in an emergency, sending raw Destruction magic erupting in all directions. This should be done only under desperate circumstances or safe conditions as the blast can easily overload active constructs.\nDeploy-able Barrier: While skeevatons with reinforced chassis are more common, one of the more effective defenses I've discovered is a form of emitted barrier that the skeevaton can project over a sizable radius, allowing it to protect not only itself, but other vulnerable objects as well.\nShock Chassis: A few mischief makers and would-be saboteurs have outfitted skeevatons with dangerous modifications that generate a powerful destructive shock through the &lt;a href=\"Fabricant%20%28Online%29\"&gt;fabricant's&lt;/a&gt; exterior. This jolt is painful to living things and fry &lt;a href=\"animunculi\"&gt;animunculi&lt;/a&gt;.\nRestoration Emitter: While most skeevatons are equipped with physical tools to conduct repairs, one ingenious model incorporated a modification that generated a restorative magical field around the skeevaton that mended distressed metal, dissipated residual heat, stabilized energy emissions, and other processes used to maintain smooth operation.\n&lt;These modifications are marvelous, but there simply isn't enough room in a skeevaton to incorporate everything. I'll need to decide what's best tailored to certain roles.&gt;\nTrans-corporeal Operation: While most skeevatons I have reverse engineered have operated autonomously to carry out simple or routine tasks, I encountered several that had been tinkered with to allow an individual direct control over the fabricant. These modifications ranged from cumbersome wires, resembling a puppeteer's strings, and hand-held tonal emitters to a trans-corporeal pneumeria chamber that allows a being to inhabit the fabricant itself! This modified &lt;a href=\"Dwemer\"&gt;Dwemer&lt;/a&gt; device ingeniously converts a being into pure Liminal energy and stores it within a hermetic chamber. When connected to a fabricant the intelligence of the occupant may operate the fabricant as an extension of their animus. Obviously, this allows for unprecedented precision of control, but it also carries immense risk. If the skeevaton were to suffer a catastrophic failure while the pneumeria chamber was occupied, the animus would be violently ejected and almost certainly kill the occupant, if they even rematerialized at all."}
