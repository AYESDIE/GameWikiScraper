As the tower is sunken, there is no door, instead there is a hidden cave/tunnel called the Fume Vaults. The entrance to Fume Vaults are located on islands away towards the north/northwest of the sunken tower.\nTo get there, one will have to jump small lava streams and broken bridges. A large metal gate has toppled to the ground allowing anyone to cross it like a bridge; take it and the player will be on the island where the entrance to the Vaults is. It's hidden and won't show on the map, and it's at lava level. Head towards the north tip of the island, around a small round lava pond, and drop down over a large boulder, the door is just on the right.\nUsefulness.\nIt is highly advisable to acquire the Hatred's Soul bow as the 19+ version, as it is the strongest bow in-game; the 15\u201318 bow is the next and the 11\u201314 variety is the same strength as the Daedric bow, not counting the enchantments on Hatred's Soul. Also, Hatreds Soul is much lighter than the Daedric bow.\nIf the Hero misses it going through the Chorrol gate, or they obtained a lower level version, there is a one in seven chance that entering a non-quest related gate will bring them to the same Oblivion world. The gate at &lt;a href=\"Fort%20Sutch\"&gt;Fort Sutch&lt;/a&gt; has a one in four chance of being this world. Since it always spawns in the same Oblivion world, it's possible to obtain multiple copies of the bow. "}

Haven is a historically disputed settlement, having been conquered by the Imperials and the High Elves throughout the eras.\nDescription.\nGeography.\nHaven is located at the southeasternmost point of Valenwood, along the Long Coast region, the area that takes the southern portion of Grahtwood. Haven is a rather large city, occupying a significant amount of land, larger than other colonial settlements built by the High Elves. Haven is a fortress-esque city, with large gates guarding the city and barracks in the center of town. East of Haven is the large bayou of Grahtwood, housing &lt;a href=\"Strangler\"&gt;Strangler&lt;/a&gt;s and &lt;a href=\"Mudcrab\"&gt;Mudcrab&lt;/a&gt;s. Northern Haven is vastly different than the Southern portion. &lt;a href=\"Phynaster%27s%20Stride\"&gt;Phynaster's Stride&lt;/a&gt; is one of the largest inns in Valenwood, which makes sense, considering travelers are more likely to reach Haven from in between &lt;a href=\"Southpoint\"&gt;Southpoint&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Elden%20Root\"&gt;Elden Root&lt;/a&gt;, or even from the &lt;a href=\"Padomaic%20Ocean\"&gt;Padomaic Ocean&lt;/a&gt;. Southern Haven is the inner wall that houses the local &lt;a href=\"Fighters%20Guild\"&gt;Fighters Guild&lt;/a&gt; chapter and other things of that similar nature. The ports of Haven resemble the Altmeri dockyards seen in &lt;a href=\"Greenwater%20Cove\"&gt;Greenwater Cove&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Mathiisen\"&gt;Mathiisen&lt;/a&gt;.\nHistory.\n&lt;a href=\"First%20Era\"&gt;First Era&lt;/a&gt;.\nFoundation of White-Gold; the Maormer Conquest.\nThe &lt;a href=\"White-Gold%20Tower\"&gt;White-Gold Tower&lt;/a&gt; was essential during the times of the &lt;a href=\"Ayleid\"&gt;Ayleid&lt;/a&gt;, who resided in the modern-day province of &lt;a href=\"Cyrodiil\"&gt;Cyrodiil&lt;/a&gt;. The White-Gold Tower established an increase in trade for various Ayleid settlements throughout the southern provinces. These settlements include Haven, &lt;a href=\"Ceyatatar\"&gt;Ceyatatar&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Bravil\"&gt;Ancient Bravil&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Silvenar%20%28City%29\"&gt;Silvenar&lt;/a&gt; all benefitted from the White-Gold's mass popularity. The Ayleid population began to expand into Valenwood and settled in the modern-day city-state of &lt;a href=\"Elden%20Root\"&gt;Elden Root&lt;/a&gt;, where they created libraries with the knowledge that lasted for years and universities to teach the next generation the ways of life. All of this would come to an end when the &lt;a href=\"Maormer\"&gt;Maormer&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"Pyandonea\"&gt;Pyandonea&lt;/a&gt; set foot on Valenwood and sacked several settlements, including Haven and &lt;a href=\"Woodhearth\"&gt;Woodhearth&lt;/a&gt;. Elden Root was ultimately besieged, leaving this civilization in the dirt.\nThe Treethane's Independence; the Alessian Intervention.\nIn &lt;a href=\"1E%202714\"&gt;1E 2714&lt;/a&gt;, the province of Valenwood fell under the &lt;a href=\"Alessian%20Empire\"&gt;Alessian Empire&lt;/a&gt; after the constant warring between the &lt;a href=\"Colovian%20Estates\"&gt;Colovian Estates&lt;/a&gt; of the West and the denizens of Valenwood. Even when &lt;a href=\"Empress%20Hestra\"&gt;Empress Hestra&lt;/a&gt; improved relations with the Colovians, the war continued to ravage the Weald, and ultimately, Valenwood was given to the Alessians. Fearing that the Bosmeri-folk would not unite against their empire, the Alessian Empire granted independence to the &lt;a href=\"Treethane\"&gt;Treethane&lt;/a&gt;s of Valenwood. The settlements include, but are not limited to, Haven, Elden Root, and &lt;a href=\"Archen\"&gt;Archen&lt;/a&gt; became full-fledged city-states and very successful trading posts between the &lt;a href=\"Colovian%20West\"&gt;Colovian West&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Padomaic%20Ocean\"&gt;Padomaic Ocean&lt;/a&gt;. Haven, was one such trading post that had an advantage, for being located near several notable cities such as Elden Root and &lt;a href=\"Torval\"&gt;Torval&lt;/a&gt;.\n&lt;a href=\"Second%20Era\"&gt;Second Era&lt;/a&gt;.\nPrelude to the Massacre of Cormount.\nWith the establishment of the &lt;a href=\"First%20Aldmeri%20Dominion\"&gt;First Aldmeri Dominion&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"2E%20580\"&gt;2E 580&lt;/a&gt;, the city of Haven was under the dominion of &lt;a href=\"Queen%20Ayrenn\"&gt;Queen Ayrenn&lt;/a&gt;, who hailed from the &lt;a href=\"Summerset%20Isles\"&gt;Summerset Isles&lt;/a&gt; and the city of &lt;a href=\"Alinor\"&gt;Alinor&lt;/a&gt;. One of the Dominion's greatest militias, the &lt;a href=\"Jade%20Dragoon\"&gt;Jade Dragoon&lt;/a&gt;s were stationed in the city-state of Haven, will Ayrenn was meeting with &lt;a href=\"King%20Camoran%20Aeradan\"&gt;King Camoran Aeradan&lt;/a&gt;. For unknown reasons, the leader of the Dragoons, &lt;a href=\"General%20Endare\"&gt;General Endare&lt;/a&gt; and the Dragoons themselves left Haven for the northernmost township of &lt;a href=\"Cormount\"&gt;Cormount&lt;/a&gt;, located on the other side of Grahtwood. What followed would be one of the bloodiest events in the history of Valenwood. Endare's forces arrived into Cormount and slaughtered the denizens without rhyme or reason. No one was spared, men, women, and even children were murdered by the Jade Butcher and her warriors. Not only did they attack the citizens of Cormount, but poisoned the Green they had overly worshipped. The Massacre caused the ties between the Dominion and Valenwood to wither and the establishment of the &lt;a href=\"Blacksap%20Rebellion\"&gt;Blacksap Rebellion&lt;/a&gt;, created by the Camorans of Cormount.\nThe Jackdaw's Uprising; the Battle of Haven.\nDuring the &lt;a href=\"Alliance%20War\"&gt;Alliance War&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"2E%20582\"&gt;2E 582&lt;/a&gt;, the city of Haven was taken by a group known as the &lt;a href=\"Jackdaw%20Pirates\"&gt;Jackdaw Pirates&lt;/a&gt;. When Endare vanished from Haven, it left the city-state abandoned and defenseless, perfect for the Jackdaw Pirates to take the city. Coincidentally, &lt;a href=\"Lord%20Gharesh-ri\"&gt;Lord Gharesh-ri&lt;/a&gt;, the Speaker of the &lt;a href=\"Mane\"&gt;Mane&lt;/a&gt; had traveled to Haven to prepare his students for their final piece of training, only to find the port town invaded by pirates. The warrior named the &lt;a href=\"Vestige\"&gt;Vestige&lt;/a&gt; had also arrived in Haven and both they and Gharesh-ri led the assault to retake Haven. The Vestige traversed the cityscape and learned the pirates planned a ritual in the Fighters Guild stronghold on Haven. By infiltrating &lt;a href=\"the%20Aquifer\"&gt;the Aquifer&lt;/a&gt; sewers below Haven, the Vestige was able to interrupt the ceremony, killing the three captains one by one. The Dominion had secured Haven, the people soon returned, and business was booming once again.\n&lt;a href=\"Third%20Era\"&gt;Third Era&lt;/a&gt;.\nHaven during the Imperial Simulacrum.\nDuring the &lt;a href=\"Imperial%20Simulacrum\"&gt;Imperial Simulacrum&lt;/a&gt; from &lt;a href=\"3E%20389\"&gt;3E 389&lt;/a&gt; to &lt;a href=\"3E%20399\"&gt;3E 399&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Emperor\"&gt;Emperor&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Uriel%20Septim%20VII\"&gt;Uriel Septim VII&lt;/a&gt; was imprisoned along with &lt;a href=\"Talin%20Warhaft\"&gt;Talin Warhaft&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;a href=\"Deadlands\"&gt;Deadlands&lt;/a&gt; by &lt;a href=\"Jagar%20Tharn\"&gt;Jagar Tharn&lt;/a&gt;. Tharn planned for months to capture the throne, and he was able to achieve so in the span of ten years. Tharn had a powerful weapon called the &lt;a href=\"Staff%20of%20Chaos\"&gt;Staff of Chaos&lt;/a&gt;, and he split it into nine pieces and scattered them across Tamriel, the staff was the only thing keeping Uriel Septim and Warhaft in &lt;a href=\"Oblivion\"&gt;Oblivion&lt;/a&gt;. A warrior escaped his clutches and traveled all corners of Tamriel to retrieve the missing pieces. The hero was known as the &lt;a href=\"Eternal%20Champion\"&gt;Eternal Champion&lt;/a&gt;, and he assembled the staff and defeated Jagar Tharn at the &lt;a href=\"Imperial%20Palace\"&gt;Imperial Palace&lt;/a&gt;. The Eternal Champion had at one point visited the city of Haven in their quest to recover the pieces. The city of Haven was under the rule of &lt;a href=\"King%20Silrim\"&gt;King Silrim&lt;/a&gt;."}

An arena stages fights between clans, and \"preliminary intelligence\" tests take place for unknown reasons.\nThe forces of Mehrunes Dagon used the realm as a headquarters during the invasion of the Battlespire. An apprentice from the Spire arrived in the Wellhead to save a fellow apprentice. The hero became an ally of Imago Storm of Clan &lt;a href=\"Dremora\"&gt;Dremora&lt;/a&gt;, who was opposed to Dagon's invasion. Imago wanted Dagon and his lieutenants banished to the &lt;a href=\"Void\"&gt;Void&lt;/a&gt;, so that he could restore Clan Dagon to stability in their absence. Imago promised the hero aid from his Dremora vassals and gave him the neonymics of Dagon, &lt;a href=\"Xivilai\"&gt;Xivilai&lt;/a&gt; and Faydra, powerful relics which would allow him to banish those Daedra.\nThe hero tracked down the two other lords of the realm, &lt;a href=\"Xivilai%20Moath\"&gt;Xivilai Moath&lt;/a&gt; of Clan Xivilai and &lt;a href=\"Faydra%20Shardai\"&gt;Faydra Shardai&lt;/a&gt; of Clan Shardai, tricking and banishing them respectively to get their keys.

The hero slew him as a traitor to the &lt;a href=\"Septim%20Empire\"&gt;Empire&lt;/a&gt; and used the keys to depart the realm.\nTrivia.\n\"We are heartened by your success in the Hunt.\"\n\"The lands of Faydra's clan lie to the west. The lands of Xivilai's clan lie to the east. These places are not open to the Dremora, and are a mystery to us. However, it may be that a cunning raider like yourself with find somethings of use there.\"\n\"To leave this realm you must enter the gate within Imago's castle. There are three keys to this gate. One I know is in the keeping of Lord Imago. The other two keys are, I presume, in the hands of Dagon's favorites, Faydra and Xivilai. This gate will bear you to the Hunting Lodge of Mehrunes Dagon, where your friend is held.\"\n\"We wish we could do more to help you. The matter rests now with you, and with the Tides of Fate.\""}

{"id": "39157", "revid": "32821740", "url": "https://elderscrolls.fandom.com/wiki?curid=39157", "title": "Hawkhaven", "text": "Hawkhaven is a location which can be accessed only via the \"coc testinghall\" &lt;a href=\"Console%20Commands%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;console command&lt;/a&gt; through the &lt;a href=\"Wizard%27s%20Tower\"&gt;Wizard's Tower&lt;/a&gt; glitch or with the &lt;a href=\"paint%20brush\"&gt;paint brush&lt;/a&gt; glitch . The Hero ends up in the &lt;a href=\"testinghall\"&gt;testinghall&lt;/a&gt; and can access the town by using one of the doors in the middle of the room.\nDescription.\nHawkhaven is a small town found in the Elder Scrolls Creation Kit. The town and its inhabitants are likely testing tools. The village itself consists of seven buildings, two of which can be entered. Several barrels and crates are scattered around that may be looted without penalty.\nInhabitants.\nThe village is policed by a single roving &lt;a href=\"City%20Watch\"&gt;guard&lt;/a&gt; who will apprehend the &lt;a href=\"Hero%20of%20Kvatch\"&gt;Hero&lt;/a&gt; for crimes just as in a normal city. In the event, all residents of the town will side with the Hero in fighting the guard. The minor inhabitants of Hawkhaven include:\nDenyiir.\nThe only merchant in the town is named &lt;a href=\"Denyiir\"&gt;Denyiir&lt;/a&gt;. He is easy to spot with his bizarre blue hair color. His \"shop\" is a low stone wall located immediately next to the door leading to the &lt;a href=\"Testinghall\"&gt;Testinghall&lt;/a&gt;. In front of him can be found a &lt;a href=\"Blades%20Cuirass%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;Blades Cuirass&lt;/a&gt;, as well as copies of &lt;a href=\"Darkest%20Darkness\"&gt;Darkest Darkness&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"The%20Locked%20Room\"&gt;The Locked Room&lt;/a&gt;. He provides all possible services of a merchant in . These services include:\nDenyiir has the highest amount of bartering gold of any character in the game (65,535).\nA unique feature of Denyiir's behavior is his Speech. Rather than normal speech topics, conversing with Denyiir will bring up a list of emotions such as \"Angry\" or \"Happy\" which will change his facial expression and disposition accordingly.\nDebug characters.\nTwo characters are clearly intended for testing combat and are named for their function.\nTrespass Test Warehouse.\nOne of the two functional buildings in Hawkhaven is the Trespass Test Warehouse, obviously intended to debug the concept of trespassing and/or stealing someone's property. The house is inhabited by Belgarr, an Imperial, who also owns all items and containers inside the house. He has no speech options, but will verbally warn the Hero when they are inside the house, and will summon the town guard if they linger too long or attempt to steal an item.\nCrime Warehouse.\nThe Crime Warehouse functions as the town's prison, where the Hero will be sent if they commit a crime. Inside, it is a miniature version of any other prison encountered in &lt;a href=\"Cyrodiil\"&gt;Cyrodiil&lt;/a&gt;. It has a single cell, as well as a chest labeled \"Evidence\" where the Hero may collect their confiscated belongings.\nOutside Hawkhaven.\nOutside the town there is an altar that creates &lt;a href=\"Black%20Soul%20Gem%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;Black Soul Gems&lt;/a&gt;. It is identifiable by a bright shaft of light beaming into the sky. A nearby road, along which &lt;a href=\"Fly%20Amanita%20Cap\"&gt;fly amanita&lt;/a&gt; mushrooms grow, leads to the Creature Grove.\nUses.\nHawkhaven can serve many uses. Because of its unique nature, and isolation from the game world, novices to the Elder Scrolls Creation Kit may test all manner of changes, without having to worry about conflicting with existing mechanics or quests.\nHawkhaven can also serve as a \"playground\" of sorts, allowing practicing archery or swordsmanship on its inhabitants."}

The nine &lt;a href=\"Jarl\"&gt;Jarl&lt;/a&gt;s of &lt;a href=\"Skyrim\"&gt;Skyrim&lt;/a&gt; each have a housecarl. It is common practice for &lt;a href=\"Thane%20%28Title%29\"&gt;Thanes&lt;/a&gt; to have housecarls as well. Persons of extreme notability, such as the &lt;a href=\"Last%20Dragonborn\"&gt;Dragonborn&lt;/a&gt;, who emerged during the &lt;a href=\"Dragon%20Crisis\"&gt;Dragon Crisis&lt;/a&gt; of the &lt;a href=\"Fourth%20Era\"&gt;Fourth Era&lt;/a&gt;, may have several housecarls, each of whom might have accompanied them into combat as a &lt;a href=\"Followers%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;follower&lt;/a&gt; or engaged them as a &lt;a href=\"Marriage%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;spouse&lt;/a&gt;.\nRelationship to liege.\nA housecarl is a formidable warrior, and is usually found next to, or close by their master. If their Jarl or Thane is attacked, the housecarl will be the first to enter the battle to fight for his or her liege's life. It is socially acceptable for a Thane to marry their housecarl.\nIn &lt;a href=\"Falkreath%20Hold%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Falkreath&lt;/a&gt;, the title seems to be more of an office \u2014 as &lt;a href=\"Helvard\"&gt;Helvard&lt;/a&gt; puts it, \"I protect the Jarl, whoever that might be.\" This means that the Housecarl of Falkreath is not sworn to protect a single individual and continues his service if a new Jarl takes over. On the other hand, it may simply be Helvard's personal preference.\nHousecarls appointed to the Dragonborn.\n&lt;a href=\"Becoming%20Thane\"&gt;Becoming&lt;/a&gt; the &lt;a href=\"Thane%20%28Title%29\"&gt;Thane&lt;/a&gt; of a &lt;a href=\"Hold\"&gt;Hold&lt;/a&gt; will grant a personal housecarl. In the base game, all available housecarls are &lt;a href=\"Nords%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Nord&lt;/a&gt; warriors, as is &lt;a href=\"Gregor\"&gt;Gregor&lt;/a&gt;, the housecarl for &lt;a href=\"the%20Pale\"&gt;the Pale&lt;/a&gt;, who is added by . Of the other two \"Hearthfire\" housecarls, &lt;a href=\"Valdimar%20%28Hearthfire%29\"&gt;Valdimar&lt;/a&gt; is a battlemage rather than a warrior, and &lt;a href=\"Rayya\"&gt;Rayya&lt;/a&gt; is a &lt;a href=\"Redguards%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Redguard&lt;/a&gt; rather than a Nord.\nThe five housecarls in the base game have the same base gear: a set of &lt;a href=\"Steel%20Armor%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Steel Armor&lt;/a&gt; without a helmet, accompanied by a &lt;a href=\"Steel%20Sword%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Steel Sword&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Steel%20Shield%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Shield&lt;/a&gt;. Should they be provided with a more damaging weapon than their default one, they will automatically switch to said weapon.\nThe three \"Hearthfire\" housecarls each have a slightly different equipment: Rayya duel-wields &lt;a href=\"scimitar\"&gt;scimitar&lt;/a&gt;s; Gregor uses a two-handed &lt;a href=\"Steel%20Greatsword%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Steel Greatsword&lt;/a&gt;; and Valdimar wears &lt;a href=\"Light%20Armor%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;light&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Scaled%20Armor%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;scaled armor&lt;/a&gt;, wields a &lt;a href=\"Steel%20Mace%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Steel Mace&lt;/a&gt;, and uses &lt;a href=\"Destruction%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Destruction spells&lt;/a&gt;.\nAfter being appointed, housecarls can be found in the player's &lt;a href=\"Houses%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;House&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"Homestead%20%28Hearthfire%29\"&gt;homestead&lt;/a&gt; in the relevant &lt;a href=\"Holds\"&gt;Hold&lt;/a&gt;. If this property is not owned, the housecarl will wait in the &lt;a href=\"Jarl\"&gt;Jarl&lt;/a&gt;'s residence.\nHousecarls match &lt;a href=\"Character%20Level\"&gt;Character Level&lt;/a&gt; at the time of appointment, with a level cap of 50.\nNo housecarl is available in &lt;a href=\"Winterhold%20%28Skyrim%20Hold%29\"&gt;Winterhold&lt;/a&gt;.\nTrivia.\nReal-world definition.\nIn Medieval Scandinavia, the (h\u00faskarl) were personal male servants of Scandinavian Chieftains, Jarls and Kings, their roles encompassed many aspects involving a person's home, such as organizing the household, guarding the master's properties, and were also in charge of protecting their master's interests. The word housecarl is a direct translation of the Norse word h\u00faskarl (house man). \nThe term was also used in Anglo-Saxon England, where the Housecarls were not just bodyguards and keepers of household, but the elite fighters and leaders of the Jarl's armies."}

The player can own one house in each of the major &lt;a href=\"Cyrodiil%23County%20capitals\"&gt;cities&lt;/a&gt; (except &lt;a href=\"Kvatch%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;Kvatch&lt;/a&gt;), for a total of eight houses. Player-bought houses allow room to store equipment and collectables, to &lt;a href=\"Rest\"&gt;sleep&lt;/a&gt;, and to generally relax after adventuring through &lt;a href=\"Cyrodiil\"&gt;Cyrodiil&lt;/a&gt;.\nEach house has upgrades (known as \"furnishings\"), that can be purchased from a local &lt;a href=\"Merchants%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;merchant&lt;/a&gt;. These upgrades provide furniture, chests, and other things to finish out the rooms of the house. The base cost of these upgrades can total between 2,000 and over 30,000 , depending on the house and which furnishings are bought. The only exception is the house in &lt;a href=\"Anvil%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;Anvil&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Benirus%20Manor\"&gt;Benirus Manor&lt;/a&gt;, which is fully furnished after the completion of the &lt;a href=\"Where%20Spirits%20Have%20Lease\"&gt;related quest&lt;/a&gt;. Details on the furnishings available for purchase for each house are available on each of the houses' articles. Furnishings automatically go into the house into preset locations when purchased.\nGallery of houses.\nThis is the order of available houses in the game, from cheapest to most expensive, in terms of total base cost, which includes all upgrades' base costs: \nObtaining a house.\nAnvil.\nFrom rumors in &lt;a href=\"Anvil%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;Anvil&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"Hero%20of%20Kvatch\"&gt;Hero of Kvatch&lt;/a&gt; hears that &lt;a href=\"Velwyn%20Benirus\"&gt;Velwyn Benirus&lt;/a&gt; is selling Benirus Manor for 5,000 . Once one has bought and slept in the manor, it will become obvious that it is cursed and haunted. Restoring the house and removing the curse requires completion of the quest \"&lt;a href=\"Where%20Spirits%20Have%20Lease\"&gt;Where Spirits Have Lease&lt;/a&gt;.\" Also, once the curse is lifted the house will be automatically furnished, not requiring any money.\nBravil.\n&lt;a href=\"Bravil%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;Bravil&lt;/a&gt;'s house is a wooden shack that costs 4,000 . &lt;a href=\"Count%20Regulus%20Terentius\"&gt;Count Regulus Terentius&lt;/a&gt;'s &lt;a href=\"Disposition\"&gt;Disposition&lt;/a&gt; must be 50 before he will sell this house. He claims that the smell will quickly distract attention from its ugly looks. It is located on the south side of the canal below &lt;a href=\"Luciana%20Galena\"&gt;Luciana Galena&lt;/a&gt;'s home.\nAfter buying the house in Bravil, a quest begins for the purchase of the upgrades. To complete this quest, buy all the housing accouterments at &lt;a href=\"The%20Fair%20Deal\"&gt;The Fair Deal&lt;/a&gt; in town.\nBruma.\nThe Bruma house is a two-story log house that costs 10,000 , located north of &lt;a href=\"Bruma%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;Bruma&lt;/a&gt;'s east gateway. &lt;a href=\"Countess%20Narina%20Carvain\"&gt;Countess Narina Carvain&lt;/a&gt; will sell it once her disposition towards the player is 60, unless the quest \"&lt;a href=\"Lifting%20the%20Vale\"&gt;Lifting the Vale&lt;/a&gt;\" is active, in which case, it needs to be finished before the house can be bought. Furniture can be bought from &lt;a href=\"Suurootan\"&gt;Suurootan&lt;/a&gt; at &lt;a href=\"Novaroma\"&gt;Novaroma&lt;/a&gt;, which is between the &lt;a href=\"Jerall%20View%20Inn\"&gt;Jerall View Inn&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Nord%20Winds\"&gt;Nord Winds&lt;/a&gt;, one tier down from the castle.\nThere is a random event where Suurootan is killed by the Bruma Guards.\nCheydinhal.\nTalk to the Count in the &lt;a href=\"Cheydinhal%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;Cheydinhal&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Castle%20Cheydinhal\"&gt;Castle&lt;/a&gt; County Hall during the daytime. His Disposition must be 60 before he will talk about a house. The cost of the house is 15,000 , and is located in the southwest corner of Cheydinhal. Furniture can be bought at &lt;a href=\"Borba%27s%20Goods%20and%20Stores\"&gt;Borba's Goods and Stores&lt;/a&gt;, which is located near the West Gate.\nChorrol.\nThis house, Arborwatch, is available for 20,000 . It sits next to the &lt;a href=\"Mages%20Guild%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;Mages Guild&lt;/a&gt;, and can be bought from &lt;a href=\"Countess%20Arriana%20Valga\"&gt;Countess Arriana Valga&lt;/a&gt; once her Disposition has been raised to 70. &lt;a href=\"Chorrol\"&gt;Chorrol&lt;/a&gt; is a town with high standards, and a &lt;a href=\"fame\"&gt;fame&lt;/a&gt; of at least thirteen is needed before this house can be acquired. Furniture can be bought from &lt;a href=\"Seed-Neeus\"&gt;Seed-Neeus&lt;/a&gt; at &lt;a href=\"Northern%20Goods%20and%20Trade\"&gt;Northern Goods and Trade&lt;/a&gt;, which is just west of the South Gate. Although there is an upgrade called \"Servants Quarters,\" there are no servants for this house.\nImperial City.\nThe cheapest house in the game is available for only 2,000 , on the &lt;a href=\"Imperial%20City%20Waterfront\"&gt;Imperial City Waterfront&lt;/a&gt;. To buy the house, visit the &lt;a href=\"Office%20of%20Imperial%20Commerce\"&gt;Office of Imperial Commerce&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;a href=\"Imperial%20City%2C%20Market%20District\"&gt;Market District&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Imperial%20City\"&gt;Imperial City&lt;/a&gt;. One may need to bribe the official to get her Disposition high enough, but it does not cost much. This will give the Hero a little shack in the &lt;a href=\"Imperial%20City%20Waterfront\"&gt;Waterfront District&lt;/a&gt;. This house is rather useful for those who enjoy a thieving lifestyle, as it is easily accessible, and located near &lt;a href=\"Armand%20Christophe\"&gt;Armand Christophe&lt;/a&gt;, who can clear one's bounty.\nFurnishings can be purchased at &lt;a href=\"Three%20Brothers%20Trade%20Goods\"&gt;Three Brothers Trade Goods&lt;/a&gt;. The storage upgrade can also be obtained by stealing the \"house storage area\" note from on top of a crate in &lt;a href=\"Marinus%20Catiotus\"&gt;Marinus Catiotus&lt;/a&gt;' basement, in the &lt;a href=\"Imperial%20City%2C%20Elven%20Gardens%20District\"&gt;Elven Gardens District&lt;/a&gt;. The \"house kitchen area\" and \"house wall hangings\" notes can be found on a desk in the private quarters of &lt;a href=\"Tertius%20Favonius%27%20House\"&gt;Tertius Favonius'&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Stantus%20Varrid%27s%20House\"&gt;Stantus Varrid's&lt;/a&gt; houses located in the same district.\nKvatch.\n&lt;a href=\"Kvatch%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;Kvatch&lt;/a&gt; has been destroyed (except for the church and the castle), and therefore has no attainable houses.\nLeyawiin.\n&lt;a href=\"Leyawiin%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;Leyawiin&lt;/a&gt;'s property is a small but serviceable house for 7,000 , near the center of town \u2013 just north of &lt;a href=\"Rosentia%20Gallenus\"&gt;Rosentia Gallenus&lt;/a&gt;' house and across the street from &lt;a href=\"Weebam-Na\"&gt;Weebam-Na&lt;/a&gt;'s. &lt;a href=\"Count\"&gt;Count&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Marius%20Caro\"&gt;Marius Caro&lt;/a&gt;'s Disposition must be coaxed up to 60 before he will discuss the purchase. &lt;a href=\"Gundalas\"&gt;Gundalas&lt;/a&gt; at the &lt;a href=\"Best%20Goods%20and%20Guarantees\"&gt;Best Goods and Guarantees&lt;/a&gt; sells the furniture upgrades.\nSkingrad.\n&lt;a href=\"Skingrad%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;Skingrad&lt;/a&gt; has the largest house, costing 25,000 , and is complete with a maid (once the furniture set for the servants' quarters has been purchased). To be able to buy Rosethorn Hall, talk to &lt;a href=\"Shum%20gro-Yarug\"&gt;Shum gro-Yarug&lt;/a&gt; at the castle (he might also be at the &lt;a href=\"West%20Weald%20Inn\"&gt;West Weald Inn&lt;/a&gt;), about buying a house. His Disposition must be raised to 70 to before he will discuss the matter and one needs a Fame of 15. The spacious rooms and decorated hallways are expensive, however. Buying this house will kick out its former tenant, &lt;a href=\"Vandorallen%20Trebatius\"&gt;Vandorallen Trebatius&lt;/a&gt;, who moves to a room in the &lt;a href=\"Two%20Sisters%20Lodge\"&gt;Two Sisters Lodge&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe house has a basement and three stories with the master bedroom on the top floor. After buying all of the furnishings from &lt;a href=\"Gunder\"&gt;Gunder&lt;/a&gt; at &lt;a href=\"Colovian%20Traders\"&gt;Colovian Traders&lt;/a&gt;, the house will include plethora of chests and cases to store items in.\nBuying this house also allows two more mini-quests to be done.\n\"Incidental\" properties.\nThere are a number of houses and properties that can be used as a place to rest and store one's treasure. For example, when joining the &lt;a href=\"Dark%20Brotherhood%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;Dark Brotherhood&lt;/a&gt;, a quest will require stalking through &lt;a href=\"Summitmist%20Manor\"&gt;Summitmist Manor&lt;/a&gt; in Skingrad, systematically eliminating the other guests. Once this quest is completed, the manor remains open, providing a place to stash items. Items in the manor are sometimes reset, however, and it is recommended that valuable loot is not stored here for long periods of time, as they may disappear. The same goes for some other incidental properties, as they are not specifically meant to house the Hero.\nLong-term storage chests.\nCertain chests can be used for long-term storage, so their contents do not get automatically reset after a certain period of time.\nHomes from add-ons.\nFrostcrag Spire.\n&lt;a href=\"Frostcrag%20Spire%20%28Location%29\"&gt;Frostcrag Spire&lt;/a&gt;, also known as the &lt;a href=\"Wizard%27s%20Tower\"&gt;Wizard's Tower&lt;/a&gt;, is a towering magic home designed with &lt;a href=\"magic\"&gt;magic&lt;/a&gt; users in mind. The tower provides a large basement with storage and chests, complete with &lt;a href=\"Vault%20Guardian\"&gt;Vault Guardian&lt;/a&gt;s, an &lt;a href=\"Alchemy%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;alchemical&lt;/a&gt; desk, an &lt;a href=\"Altar%20of%20Enchanting\"&gt;Altar of Enchanting&lt;/a&gt;, and a &lt;a href=\"Altar%20of%20Spellmaking%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;Altar of Spellmaking&lt;/a&gt;. Owners can also summon &lt;a href=\"atronach\"&gt;atronach&lt;/a&gt;s and have immediate access to all the cities' Mages Guilds.\nDunbarrow Cove.\n&lt;a href=\"Dunbarrow%20Cove%20%28Location%29\"&gt;Dunbarrow Cove&lt;/a&gt;, also known as &lt;a href=\"The%20Thieves%20Den\"&gt;The Thieves Den&lt;/a&gt;, is a hidden cove beneath &lt;a href=\"Anvil%20Castle%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;Anvil Castle&lt;/a&gt; that holds the infamous \"&lt;a href=\"Black%20Flag\"&gt;Black Flag&lt;/a&gt;\" pirate ship. Sneaky, thievery-types can &lt;a href=\"Fence%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;fence&lt;/a&gt; away stolen goods, barter with &lt;a href=\"Stealth%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;stealth&lt;/a&gt;-oriented merchants, train various stealth-type skills, improve &lt;a href=\"lockpicking%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;lockpicking&lt;/a&gt; skills, and command a crew of &lt;a href=\"Pirate%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;pirates&lt;/a&gt; to plunder gold.\nDeepscorn Hollow.\n&lt;a href=\"Deepscorn%20Hollow%20%28Oblivion%20Location%29\"&gt;Deepscorn Hollow&lt;/a&gt;, also known as &lt;a href=\"The%20Vile%20Lair\"&gt;The Vile Lair&lt;/a&gt;, is a multilevel underwater cove that provides refuge for players more in touch with the \"dark side.\" Besides the usual housing furnishings and storage, the dungeon is also catered mainly to worshipers of &lt;a href=\"Sithis\"&gt;Sithis&lt;/a&gt; and has a \"&lt;a href=\"Cattle%20Pen\"&gt;cattle pen&lt;/a&gt;\" for &lt;a href=\"Vampire%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;vampires&lt;/a&gt;.\nBattlehorn Castle.\n&lt;a href=\"Battlehorn%20Castle\"&gt;Battlehorn Castle&lt;/a&gt;, also known as the &lt;a href=\"Fighter%27s%20Stronghold\"&gt;Fighter's Stronghold&lt;/a&gt;, is a large castle located west of Chorrol. The establishment provides for a more noble setting, as well as strength-oriented upgrades. Upgrades include a taxidermist, maid, guards, a wine-cellar, and a sparring partner among other things."}

The Dragonborn can ask &lt;a href=\"Marriage%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;spouses&lt;/a&gt; to move into a house or choose to move into the spouse's house. Children also are able to change houses.\nList of purchasable properties.\nPlots.\nWith the addition of , plots of land can be bought for 5,000 in order to build a &lt;a href=\"Homestead%20%28Hearthfire%29\"&gt;Homestead&lt;/a&gt;.\nAdvantages and Disadvantages.\nBreezehome.\nBreezehome, in Whiterun, is inexpensive and easily acquired early in the game, but it is the only home that lacks an &lt;a href=\"Arcane%20Enchanter%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;enchanting table&lt;/a&gt;. It and Vlindrel Hall are the only homes that provide adequate storage in the alchemy room. In order to access an Arcane Enchanter in Whiterun, the &lt;a href=\"Last%20Dragonborn\"&gt;Dragonborn&lt;/a&gt; must exit Breezehome, then head to &lt;a href=\"Dragonsreach\"&gt;Dragonsreach&lt;/a&gt; on the opposite end of the city. If the Dragonborn is a member of the &lt;a href=\"Thieves%20Guild%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Thieves Guild&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"Fence%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;fence&lt;/a&gt; in Whiterun is located outside of the city entirely, at &lt;a href=\"Honningbrew%20Meadery\"&gt;Honningbrew Meadery&lt;/a&gt;, making it one of the more inconvenient fences to reach. Breezehome is conveniently close to the town's &lt;a href=\"smelter\"&gt;smelter&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Blacksmiths%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;blacksmith&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Alchemists%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;alchemist&lt;/a&gt;, general goods store, and both &lt;a href=\"Taverns%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;taverns&lt;/a&gt;. A second smelter can be found at &lt;a href=\"The%20Companions\"&gt;The Companions&lt;/a&gt;' &lt;a href=\"Jorrvaskr\"&gt;headquarters&lt;/a&gt;.\nHoneyside.\nHoneyside, in Riften, is similarly inexpensive and can be acquired early in the game. Unlike Breezehome, it can be equipped with an enchanting table. Additionally, the Thieves Guild fence, &lt;a href=\"Tonilia\"&gt;Tonilia&lt;/a&gt;, is located in &lt;a href=\"the%20Ragged%20Flagon\"&gt;the Ragged Flagon&lt;/a&gt;, which requires a significant trip with three transitions to reach from the home. A perk to owning Honeyside is that it comes with a private dock, allowing the Dragonborn to access the home from outside of the city. \nVlindrel Hall.\nVlindrel Hall, in &lt;a href=\"Markarth%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Markarth&lt;/a&gt;, has both an alchemy table and enchanting table. &lt;a href=\"Smithing%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Smithing&lt;/a&gt; amenities are available, including a Smelter, but are located across town. The fence in Markarth, &lt;a href=\"Endon\"&gt;Endon&lt;/a&gt;, is located nearby, but moves around and sometimes requires a transition to reach. Vlindrel Hall has the disadvantage of having fewer armor storage mannequins than the other \"higher-end\" homes, having only one. Vlindrel Hall is a good choice for book collectors as it provides the most book storage (162 books), thanks to three large bookshelves conveniently located next to each other instead of scattered smaller shelves such as in Hjerim.\nHjerim.\nHjerim, in Windhelm, contains both an Arcane Enchanter and an Alchemy Lab (once upgraded), and is close to &lt;a href=\"Smithing%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;smithing&lt;/a&gt; amenities, a smelter, and the Windhelm fence, all of which are closely grouped with zero transitions. &lt;a href=\"Niranye\"&gt;Niranye&lt;/a&gt;, the Windhelm fence, is located outside in a market stall, whereas every other fence (except for Endon in Markarth, sometimes) requires at least one additional transition to reach. Lack of storage space is a concern, as is the very poor lighting in the hidden room containing the Alchemy and Enchanting areas (dropping &lt;a href=\"Torch%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;torches&lt;/a&gt; strategically may fix this). Hjerim also takes some of the most work to acquire, as the quest \"&lt;a href=\"Blood%20on%20the%20Ice\"&gt;Blood on the Ice&lt;/a&gt;\" and part of the &lt;a href=\"Civil%20War\"&gt;Civil War&lt;/a&gt; questline must be finished before purchasing the house.\nProudspire Manor.\nProudspire Manor, in Solitude, is by far the most expensive home in the game, costing 25,000 gold. Solitude itself offers an average selection of shops, however they are located some distance away from the manor. The Solitude fence is located nearby, but will require a transition to reach. One must buy this property to complete the quest \"&lt;a href=\"No%20Stone%20Unturned%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;No Stone Unturned&lt;/a&gt;\" legitimately as one of the &lt;a href=\"Stones%20of%20Barenziah\"&gt;Stones of Barenziah&lt;/a&gt; is in the bedroom area unless they are using the multiple Stones of Barenziah glitch.\nSeverin Manor.\nSeverin Manor, in Raven Rock, is a sizable &lt;a href=\"Dunmer%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Dunmer&lt;/a&gt; home given to the Dragonborn by completing the quest \"&lt;a href=\"Served%20Cold\"&gt;Served Cold&lt;/a&gt;.\" By default it is fully furnished, and contains an Arcane Enchanter, Alchemy Lab, and Forge, as well as a large storage space, allowing one to unload some unwanted gear without having to leave the island. The downsides are the fact that one must travel from Skyrim to &lt;a href=\"Solstheim%20%28Dragonborn%29\"&gt;Solstheim&lt;/a&gt; to collect the items stored within, and one's spouse cannot move here.\nShadowfoot Sanctum.\n Shadowfoot Sanctum, in Riften, is a sizable home purchased from Vekel the Man. By default it is fully furnished and contains an Arcane Enchanter, Alchemy Lab, Smelter, Grindstone, Workbench, and Forge. It has a room for children built in along with a hidden entrance to an armory. It also has quick access to the Ragged Flagon. The downsides are that it is hard to access, having to go through the Ragged Flagon or the ratway, or by a secret entrance at the Riften docks, leading to the pool by the forge space.\nConclusion.\nHjerim can only be acquired upon progressing to a certain point in the Civil War questline while Vlindrel Hall cannot be acquired until at least level 20 and Proudspire Manor is prohibitively expensive for most low-level players. Breezehome and Honeyside are smaller, and each less convenient in some ways, but can be obtained much earlier in the game for the majority of players. Therefore, which house is most advantageous will likely depend upon playstyle and personal preference.\nFaction related houses.\nFaction houses are granted free of charge upon joining with a guild. Spouses cannot live with the Dragonborn at these locations unless the spouse is also a member, for instance &lt;a href=\"Aela%20the%20Huntress%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Aela the Huntress&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Onmund\"&gt;Onmund&lt;/a&gt; being members of &lt;a href=\"the%20Companions\"&gt;the Companions&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"College%20of%20Winterhold%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;College of Winterhold&lt;/a&gt; respectively.\nThe chest and barrel in Kodlak's Quarters in Jorrvaskr in Whiterun can reset, thus permanently deleting all items placed within them after a certain period of time. The wardrobe, cupboard and other containers do not, however.\nSpouse houses.\nThe following is a list of all the possible spouses who own property and the conditions required to marry them.\nShacks.\nShacks are improvised, but free to use, buildings with at least one bed and one or more containers that will not reset.\nBugs.\n!Click to see the list of bugs encountered"}

The &lt;a href=\"Imperial\"&gt;Imperial&lt;/a&gt; council agrees.\u201d\n\u201cWhat must we do?\u201d asked the Orc, his voice low and harsh, unused to the tongue of the &lt;a href=\"Cyrodiil\"&gt;Cyrodiil&lt;/a&gt;s.\n\u201cThe first claimant, that's you, Lord Gortwog, may choose the armor and weapon of the duelists. The second claimant, that's you, Lord Bowyn, may choose the location. If you would prefer, either or both you may choose a champion or you may duel yourself.\u201d\nThe &lt;a href=\"Breton\"&gt;Breton&lt;/a&gt; and the Orc looked at one another, evaluating. Finally, Gortwog spoke, \u201cThe armor will be Orcish and the weapons will be common steel long swords. No enchantments. No wizardry allowed.\u201d\n\u201cThe arena will be the central courtyard of my cousin Lord Berylth's palace in Wayrest,\u201d said Bowyn, looking Gortwog in the eye scornfully. \u201cNone of your kind will be allowed in to witness.\u201d\nSo it was agreed. Gortwog declared that he would fight the duel himself, and Bowyn, who was a fairly young man and in better than average condition, felt that he could not keep his honor without competing himself as well. Still, upon arriving at his cousin's palace a week before the duel was scheduled, he felt the need to practice. A suit of Orcish armor was purchased and for the first time in his life, Bowyn wore something of tremendous weight and limited facility.\nBowyn and Berylth sparred in the courtyard. In ten minutes times, Bowyn had to stop. He was red-faced and out of breath from trying to move in the armor: to add to his exasperation, he had not scored one blow on his cousin, and had dozens of feinted strikes scored on him.\n\u201cI don't know what to do,\u201d said Bowyn over dinner. \u201cEven if I knew someone who could fight properly in that beastly steel, I couldn't possibly send in a champion to battle Gortwog.\u201d\nBerylth commiserated. As the servants cleared the plates, Bowyn stood up in his seat and pointed at one of them: \u201cYou didn't tell me you had an Orc in your household!\u201d\n\u201cSir?\u201d whined the elderly specimen, turning to Lord Berylth, certain that he caused offense somehow.\n\u201cYou mean Old Tunner?\u201d laughed Berylith. \u201cHe's been with my house for ages. Would you like him to give you training on how to move in Orcish armor?\u201d\n\u201cWould you like me to?\u201d asked Tunner obsequiously.\nUnknown to Berylith but known to him now, his servant had once ridden with the legendary Cursed Legion of &lt;a href=\"High%20Rock\"&gt;High Rock&lt;/a&gt;. He not only knew how to fight in Orcish armor himself, but he had acted as trainer to other Orcs before retiring into domestic service. Desperate, Bowyn immediately engaged him as his full-time trainer.\n\u201c try too hard, sir,\u201d said the Orc on their first day in the arena. \u201cIt is easy to strain yourself in heavy mail. The joints are just so to let you to bend with only a little effort. If you fight against the joints, you won't have any strength to fight your foe.\u201d\nBowyn tried to follow Tunner's instructions, but he quickly grew frustrated. And the more frustrated he got, the more intensity he put into his work, which tired him out even quicker. While he took a break to drink some water, Berylith spoke to his servant. If they were optimistic about Bowyn's chances, their faces did not show it.\nTunner trained Bowyn hard the next two days, but her Ladyship Elysora's birthday followed hard upon them, and Bowyn enjoyed the feast thoroughly. A liquor of poppies and goose fat, and cock tinsh with buttered hyssop for a first course; roasted pike, combwort, and balls of rabbit meat for a second; sliced fox tongues, ballom pudding with oyster gravy, battaglir weed and beans for the main course; collequiva ice and sugar fritters for dessert. As Bowyn was settling back afterwards, his eyes weary, he suddenly spied Gortwog and the judge entering the room.\n\u201cWhat are you doing here?\u201d he cried. \u201cThe duel's not for another two days!\u201d\n\u201cLord Gortwog asked that we move it to tonight,\u201d said the judge. \u201cYou were training when my emisary [sic] arrived two days ago, but his lordship your cousin spoke for you, agreeing to the change of date.\u201d\n\u201cBut there's no time to assemble my supporters,\u201d complained Bowyn. \u201cAnd I've just devoured a feast that would kill a lesser man. Cousin, how could you neglect to tell me?\u201d\n\u201cI spoke to Tunner about it,\u201d said Berylith, blushing, unused to deception. \u201cWe decided that you would be best served under these conditions.\u201d\nThe battle in the arena was sparsely attended. Saturated with food, Bowyn found himself unable to move very quickly. To his surprise, the armor responded to his lethargy, rotating smoothly and elegantly to each stagger. The more he successfully maneuvered, the more he allowed his mind and not his body to control his defensive and offensive actions. For the first time in his life, Bowyn saw what it was to look through the helmet of an Orc.\nOf course, he lost, and rather badly if scores had been tabulated. Gortwog was a master of such battle. But Bowyn fought on for more than three hours before the judge reluctantly called a winner.\n\u201cI will name the land &lt;a href=\"Orsinium\"&gt;Orsinium&lt;/a&gt; after the land of my fathers,\u201d said the victor.\nBowyn's first thought was that if he must lose to an Orc, it was best that the battle was largely unwatched by his friends and family. As he left the courtyard to go to the bed he had longed for earlier in the evening, he saw Gortwog speaking to Tunner. Though he did not understand the language, he could see that they knew each other. When the Breton was in bed, he had a servant bring the old Orc to him.\n\u201cTunner,\u201d he said kindly. \u201cSpeak frankly to me. You wanted Lord Gortwog to win.\u201d\n\u201cThat is true,\u201d said Tunner. \u201cBut I did not fail you. You fought better than you would have fought two days hence, sir. I did not want Orsinium to be won by its king without a fight.\u201d"}

We know they can be trained to carry packs, and we love them for their docile nature, but what do we really know about our relationship with these steadfast beasts? In my years working with guar, I have discovered that they have a much greater capacity for learning than we could ever expect. My studies have yielded what I believe are some of the best methods for guar training, useful whether you are interested in studying them in-depth or just in getting ol' Rollie to stop chewing on your sandals.\n1. Demonstrate\nMake sure to clearly show your guar what you intend for him to do for you. Make sure to hunch over and look as much like a guar as possible. Studies have shown that just by watching, guar can learn the basics of a task. Keep his attention by carrying a bit of food that is of interest while you perform the task.\n2. Command\nClearly, slowly state the command word you wish to associate with the demonstrated behavior. Say it over and over again as you show your guar the correct way to do the task. Sometimes I find that yelling helps, as it startles the guar into paying closer attention (though it may also make him skittish).\n3. Watch\nAfter you have demonstrated what you wish your guar to do while repeating the command word, watch for the guar to make an attempt. Continue saying the command word and continue to the next step every time he makes a move in the correct direction. This can take hours or days, so be prepared to watch for a while.\n4. Reward\nGive your guar a reward even for incremental progress, such as nudging a bucket you wish him to carry. Training can be difficult, and rewarding every bit of progress will help your guar stay motivated.\n5. Repeat\nIt may take weeks for you to fully teach your guar a new task, so stay patient. Train every day, and by following these steps, you'll have the best-trained guar in the district!"}

You get all these scholar types philosophizing about anything, even stuff they don't know squat about! The other day, I saw a book about the \"art\" of the sword. I never saw anything so ridiculous. It was full of \"deep thoughts\" about how fighting is like dancing and a bunch of other &lt;a href=\"Horse%20%28Online%29\"&gt;horse&lt;/a&gt; piss.\nI've seen plenty of fights, and I can tell you that all that high-minded fuss is just going to distract you. Fighting is fighting. It's dirty, it's dangerous, and you do what you have to do to survive. I'll lay it out real simple for you right here, and then you can go smash some skulls in without worrying about dance steps or getting in tune with the soul of the blade or any of that. Here's what you need to know:\nFirst, find the biggest &lt;a href=\"Weapons%20%28Online%29\"&gt;weapon&lt;/a&gt; you can. Something you need to grab with two hands. Forget shields and bows and tiny daggers. Those aren't going to scare your enemy, and that's one of the first things you need to do. Get the hugest hammer you can. A greatsword works, too, I guess. If you can't pick it up and swing it, well, you aren't strong enough to fight, and you're going to need to lift heavy things until you can!\nSecond, start breaking things with it. Swing it from the side or from over your head, and smash boxes, scarecrows, target dummies\u2014whatever you can find. Just get a feel for how it swings. This isn't art. It's about having the scariest weapon and being strong enough and crazy enough to send the enemy fleeing when they see you use it to bash someone's helmet in.\nThird, find fights! Join a mercenary band or the military. Do whatever gets you into the action. If you know how to swing your weapon and yell really loud, they'll probably take you, especially if you're big and covered in muscles (you should be). Now you can practice on live targets without getting in trouble. Drink just enough to be angry and then get into the fight. If you're strong enough, your weapon is big enough, and you yell loud enough, you'll win\u2014no reading required."}

He is the father of Markarth's Jarl &lt;a href=\"Igmund\"&gt;Igmund&lt;/a&gt;, and brother of his former &lt;a href=\"steward\"&gt;steward&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Raerek\"&gt;Raerek&lt;/a&gt;, who now serves as steward for Jarl Igmund.\nHistory.\nWhile Jarl, the &lt;a href=\"Reachmen\"&gt;Reachmen&lt;/a&gt;, former rulers and natives of &lt;a href=\"The%20Reach\"&gt;The Reach&lt;/a&gt;, seized the opportunity to conquer Markarth in a savage uprising, due to the Empire's resources being focused on the &lt;a href=\"Great%20War\"&gt;Great War&lt;/a&gt;. Hrolfdir was ultimately unable to quell this uprising and was deposed by the Reachmen, however he and his family managed to escape the city and sought help to reclaim it.\nHrolfdir made contact with the son of the Jarl of &lt;a href=\"Windhelm%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Windhelm&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Ulfric%20Stormcloak%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Ulfric Stormcloak&lt;/a&gt;, and promised him and his militia free worship of &lt;a href=\"Talos\"&gt;Talos&lt;/a&gt; within Markarth in exchange for liberating the city from the control of the Reachmen. Ulfric and his men agreed, and successfully retook the city, captured the Reachmen's king\u00a0&lt;a href=\"Madanach\"&gt;Madanach&lt;/a&gt;\u00a0and drove the remaining hostile Reachmen from the city who then fled into the wilderness and pledged to cut a bloody hole into the Reach until the land was theirs once again,\u00a0dubbing\u00a0themselves the\u00a0&lt;a href=\"Forsworn\"&gt;Forsworn&lt;/a&gt;. After reclaiming Markarth, Hrolfdir was brutal to the Reachmen usurpers and their alleged conspirators. He was said to have executed children of alleged Forsworn sympathizers and unjustly imprisoned those accused of colluding with Forsworn usurpers. However, this might have been under pressure of Ulfric Stormcloak, who allegedly held the city at the time, including the right to decide who could and could not enter the city. Even so, &lt;a href=\"Braig\"&gt;Braig&lt;/a&gt;'s story and &lt;a href=\"Thonar%27s%20Journal\"&gt;Thonar's Journal&lt;/a&gt; seems to imply Hrolfdir had agency on who to execute. Regardless of who did the executions, those of the Forsworn who didn't run were killed, except for &lt;a href=\"Nepos%20the%20Nose\"&gt;Nepos the Nose&lt;/a&gt; and a handful of other Forsworn, including Madanach.\nShortly after the city had been liberated, a large group of &lt;a href=\"Thalmor%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Thalmor&lt;/a&gt; arrived in the city and demanded the arrest of Ulfric and his men. Refusal to obey the Thalmor's demand would have violated one of the terms of the &lt;a href=\"White-Gold%20Concordat\"&gt;White-Gold Concordat&lt;/a&gt; that forbids the worship of Talos. For Hrolfdir the choice was clear, not wanting to risk another war with the Dominion, he agreed to have Ulfric and his men arrested and personally aided the legion in the capture of Ulfric Stormcloak. Ulfric and his men called it \"The &lt;a href=\"Markarth%20Incident\"&gt;Markarth Incident&lt;/a&gt;;\" it was the founding day of the &lt;a href=\"Stormcloaks\"&gt;Stormcloaks&lt;/a&gt;\u00a0and can be considered where the &lt;a href=\"Skyrim%20Civil%20War\"&gt;Skyrim Civil War&lt;/a&gt; originally started.\nSometime after the Markarth Incident, Jarl Hrolfdir tried to make peace with the Forsworn but was instead murdered by them.\u00a0After Hrolfdir was killed, &lt;a href=\"Hrolfdir%27s%20Shield\"&gt;his shield&lt;/a&gt; was taken (presumably from his corpse) by the Forsworn and given to their &lt;a href=\"Hagraven%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Hagraven&lt;/a&gt;\u00a0matriarchs."}

Whatever happened when killed that dragon, it revealed something in you, and the Greybeards heard it. If they think you're Dragonborn, who are we to argue? You'd better get up to High Hrothgar immediately. There's no refusing the summons of the Greybeards, it's a tremendous honor. I envy you, you know. To climb the 7,000 Steps again... I made the pilgrimage once, did you know that? High Hrothgar is a very peaceful place. Very... disconnected from the troubles of this world. I wonder that the Greybeards even notice what's going on down here. They haven't seemed to care before. No matter. Go to High Hrothgar. Learn what the Greybeards can teach you.\"\nAfter another brief conversation:\nBalgruuf: \"Back to business, Proventus. We still have a city to defend.\"\nProventus: \"Yes, my lord.\"\nHrongar: \"Proventus, you must help me. We need to convince my brother to do more for the war effort.\"\nProventus: \"What would you have me do, Hrongar? Your brother is the Jarl. You know I can't question his judgement.\"\nHrongar: \"I'm not asking you to defy the Jarl, just to open his eyes. Use subtlety and suggestion to turn his thoughts to the war. You're his steward, he'll listen to you.\"\nProventus: \"Leave me out of your intrigues, Hrongar. If you have something to say to the Jarl, say it with your own tongue.\"\nProventus: \"My lord Jarl, if we do not take steps soon, our coffers will be empty.\"\nHrongar: \"Raise the taxes, then! Put anyone that refuses to pay in the stocks and make an example of them.\"\nProventus: \"As you command, my lord. But, the issue could be solved another way. If we spend less on new arms and armor for the guards, for example...\"\nHrongar: \"We're at war, old fool, or have you forgotten? Whiterun is the crown jewel of Skyrim, and you would leave us defenseless?\"\nProventus: \"Forgive me, my lord. It was foolish of me to make such a suggestion.\""}

They will also help fighting any hostile animals, even &lt;a href=\"Dragons%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;dragons&lt;/a&gt;. Hunters are non-aggressive unless attacked. In addition, they offer a limited merchant service. Hunters will usually have &lt;a href=\"hides\"&gt;hides&lt;/a&gt; and meat to sell. Hunters are a good way to level pickpocketing, as even if the &lt;a href=\"Last%20Dragonborn\"&gt;Dragonborn&lt;/a&gt; is caught, they almost never attack. However, they can send &lt;a href=\"hired%20thug\"&gt;hired thugs&lt;/a&gt; after anyone who steals from them.\nSometimes, a hunter will approach sprinting towards the player, stating that they've been attacked by vampires, showing where the vampires are (map updated) and ask if they can have a potion to cure it. If they are given a &lt;a href=\"Potions%20%28Skyrim%29%23Cure%20Condition\"&gt;potion of cure disease&lt;/a&gt; they'll give thanks and 100 gold. Otherwise, they'll say to stay out of their way as they go find a priest.\nThe Dragonborn may also encounter hunters bathing in hot springs dotted around Skyrim, notably at the &lt;a href=\"Unmarked%20Locations%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;unmarked&lt;/a&gt; . Attempts to move their clothes or steal anything from their camp will render them hostile if caught.\nIt is also possible they may send hired thugs after the Dragonborn if they steal from their camp. Even if they are not in the area, they will know who stole from them.\nWith the installation of , hunters may change into &lt;a href=\"Werewolf%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;werewolves&lt;/a&gt;. This happens around &lt;a href=\"Falkreath%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Falkreath&lt;/a&gt; more than in any of the other holds. With the installation of , hunters on &lt;a href=\"Solstheim%20%28Dragonborn%29\"&gt;Solstheim&lt;/a&gt; can be found wearing &lt;a href=\"Skaal%20Armor\"&gt;Skaal Armor&lt;/a&gt;.\nMore often than not, hunters will comment that they are aware of poaching animals in the hold they hunt in. They continue to do so because they feel what they are doing is not a crime, for \"the Jarl can hardly eat every deer now can he?\"\nThe Hunter and the Fugitive.\nA hunter will appear after a &lt;a href=\"Fugitive%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;fugitive&lt;/a&gt; interacts with the Dragonborn. The hunter will ask if they have seen the fugitive, and the Dragonborn will be given the option to reveal the location of the hiding fugitive, lie and deny seeing the fugitive, or give the hunter the item that can be assumed to have been stolen from them.\nNetch Hunt.\nWith the installation of the DLC, hunters will appear on Solstheim in Skaal outfits. They may be encountered hunting a &lt;a href=\"Netch%20%28Dragonborn%29\"&gt;Bull Netch&lt;/a&gt; and may ask the Dragonborn for assistance. These hunters will not appear on the mainland.\nStats.\nHunters level with the Dragonborn, up to level 15.

Inside the cave there are three spriggans and one &lt;a href=\"Bear%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;bear&lt;/a&gt;. The bear and a spriggan will be near the entrance and the other two spriggans near the pool. It is possible to engage them individually, but they may join their fellow creatures if too much noise is made.\nAfter completing this task, the Dragonborn will be rewarded with &lt;a href=\"Valdr%27s%20Lucky%20Dagger\"&gt;Valdr's Lucky Dagger&lt;/a&gt;. After this, Valdr will return to Falkreath, but only after taking care of his friends' bodies."}

The center of the sub-continent was inhabited by &lt;a href=\"Ashlander\"&gt;Ashlander&lt;/a&gt; tribes and was filled with untapped resources beneficial for the Dunmer of Blacklight. The Redoran Dunmer sent miners and such to Western Vvardenfell where they would uncover all sorts of minerals and build strong settlements such as Balmora and Gnisis in their rush for resources. They soon had control over the Western portion of Vvardenfell.\nThe Great Houses of Redoran, Indoril, Hlaalu, and Dres banded together to join the &lt;a href=\"Ebonheart%20Pact\"&gt;Ebonheart Pact&lt;/a&gt;, an alliance consisting of the houses mentioned before, the &lt;a href=\"Nords\"&gt;Nords&lt;/a&gt; of the &lt;a href=\"Old%20Holds\"&gt;Old Holds&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Skyrim\"&gt;Skyrim&lt;/a&gt;, and the &lt;a href=\"Argonians\"&gt;Argonians&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"Black%20Marsh\"&gt;Black Marsh&lt;/a&gt;. The city of Blacklight was among the many settlements to be a part of the Ebonheart Pact, along with Kragenmoor and &lt;a href=\"Ebonheart\"&gt;Ebonheart&lt;/a&gt; in the southeast. The Redoran Dunmer have a large part in the Pact's military prowess since they value strength and endurance.\nThe Talosion Conquest; Battle across the Redoran West.\nDuring the waning years of the Second Era, &lt;a href=\"Tiber%20Septim\"&gt;Tiber Septim&lt;/a&gt; launched a campaign to conquer the provinces of Tamriel, to unite them under a single banner. Tiber Septim used the borders of Skyrim and &lt;a href=\"Cyrodiil\"&gt;Cyrodiil&lt;/a&gt; to stage an invasion of Morrowind to the east. His army invaded the area throughout the Velothi and Valus Mountains which included the cities of Blacklight and &lt;a href=\"Kragenmoor\"&gt;Kragenmoor&lt;/a&gt;, as well as the townships of &lt;a href=\"Silgrad%20Tower\"&gt;Silgrad Tower&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Cormar%20View\"&gt;Cormaris View&lt;/a&gt;. The defense against his army consisted of warriors from the Great Houses of &lt;a href=\"Redoran\"&gt;Redoran&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"House%20Indoril\"&gt;Indoril&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Dres\"&gt;Dres&lt;/a&gt; while the Elves of &lt;a href=\"Telvanni\"&gt;Telvanni&lt;/a&gt; were indifferent with the situation and the &lt;a href=\"Hlaalu\"&gt;Hlaalu&lt;/a&gt; folk were willing to accept the Empire. Eventually, the Imperial Province of Morrowind was created with the signing of the &lt;a href=\"Treaty%20of%20the%20Armistice\"&gt;Treaty of the Armistice&lt;/a&gt;.\n&lt;a href=\"Third%20Era\"&gt;Third Era&lt;/a&gt;.\nBlacklight during the Imperial Simulacrum.\nDuring the &lt;a href=\"Imperial%20Simulacrum\"&gt;Imperial Simulacrum&lt;/a&gt; from &lt;a href=\"3E%20389\"&gt;3E 389&lt;/a&gt; to &lt;a href=\"3E%20399\"&gt;3E 399&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Emperor\"&gt;Emperor&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Uriel%20Septim%20VII\"&gt;Uriel Septim VII&lt;/a&gt; was imprisoned along with &lt;a href=\"Talin%20Warhaft\"&gt;Talin Warhaft&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;a href=\"Deadlands\"&gt;Deadlands&lt;/a&gt; by &lt;a href=\"Jagar%20Tharn\"&gt;Jagar Tharn&lt;/a&gt;. Tharn planned for months to capture the throne, and he was able to achieve so in ten years. Tharn had a powerful weapon called the &lt;a href=\"Staff%20of%20Chaos\"&gt;Staff of Chaos&lt;/a&gt;, and he split it into nine pieces and scattered them across Tamriel, the staff was the only thing keeping Uriel Septim and Warhaft in &lt;a href=\"Oblivion\"&gt;Oblivion&lt;/a&gt;. A warrior escaped his clutches and traveled all corners of Tamriel to retrieve the missing pieces. The hero was known as the &lt;a href=\"Eternal%20Champion\"&gt;Eternal Champion&lt;/a&gt;, and he assembled the staff and defeated Jagar Tharn at the &lt;a href=\"Imperial%20Palace\"&gt;Imperial Palace&lt;/a&gt;. The Eternal Champion had at one point visited the city in their quest to recover the pieces. The city of Blacklight was under the rule of &lt;a href=\"Queen%20Vermith\"&gt;Queen Vermith&lt;/a&gt;.\n&lt;a href=\"Fourth%20Era\"&gt;Fourth Era&lt;/a&gt;.\nDestruction of Vvardenfell; Dunmer Capital of Blacklight.\nThe city of Blacklight was unaffected by the events of the &lt;a href=\"Red%20Year\"&gt;Red Year&lt;/a&gt; as well as the &lt;a href=\"Accession%20War\"&gt;Accession War&lt;/a&gt;, giving it a huge advantage in the political spectrum in Morrowind. The Red Year obliterated the Vvardenfell District, causing refugees to travel to Blacklight, one notable refugee was &lt;a href=\"Neria%20Relethyl\"&gt;Neria Relethyl&lt;/a&gt;, the only survivor of the destruction of Gnisis. The lava burned a lot of Dunmer alive, causing them to perish. Relethyl was only able to live after reaching the &lt;a href=\"Samsi%20River\"&gt;Samsi River&lt;/a&gt; edge, the area where the lava was not able to reach. She was severely burned and was taken to the &lt;a href=\"Temple%20of%20Azura\"&gt;Temple of Azura&lt;/a&gt; in Blacklight; she stayed there several years after the Red Year.\nBlacklight was made into the Capital of Morrowind after the city of &lt;a href=\"Mournhold\"&gt;Mournhold&lt;/a&gt; was sacked by the &lt;a href=\"Argonians\"&gt;Argonians&lt;/a&gt; during the Accession War. Tension arose in the &lt;a href=\"Grand%20Council\"&gt;Grand Council&lt;/a&gt; after the Red Year, and the &lt;a href=\"Oblivion%20Crisis\"&gt;Oblivion Crisis&lt;/a&gt;, the Great &lt;a href=\"House%20Hlaalu\"&gt;House Hlaalu&lt;/a&gt; was no longer one of the Great Houses, being replaced by &lt;a href=\"House%20Sadras\"&gt;House Sadras&lt;/a&gt;. There was hatred between both Hlaalu and Redoran since the former believes the latter was responsible for their downfall. Redoran became the leading force in Morrowind with the other houses in their wake. The Blacklight Redorans took control of the Island of &lt;a href=\"Solstheim\"&gt;Solstheim&lt;/a&gt; and the town of &lt;a href=\"Raven%20Rock\"&gt;Raven Rock&lt;/a&gt;, located on the southwestern shore."}

Blackreach is divided into three sublocations: &lt;a href=\"Arkthzand%20Cavern\"&gt;Arkthzand Cavern&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Greymoor%20Caverns\"&gt;Greymoor Caverns&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Mzark%20Cavern\"&gt;Mzark Cavern&lt;/a&gt;.\nBackground.\nGreymoor Caverns is an expansive section of Blackreach constituting much of the subterranean area of &lt;a href=\"Hjaalmarch%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Hjaalmarch&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Haafingar%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Haafingar&lt;/a&gt;. The caverns were originally occupied by the &lt;a href=\"Dwemer\"&gt;Dwemer&lt;/a&gt; prior to their &lt;a href=\"Disappearance%20of%20the%20Dwarves\"&gt;disappearance&lt;/a&gt;, as evident by the many structures and &lt;a href=\"animunculi\"&gt;animunculi&lt;/a&gt; left behind. Now, the caverns are home to &lt;a href=\"Falmer%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Falmer&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Vampirism%20%28Online%29\"&gt;vampires&lt;/a&gt; of the &lt;a href=\"Gray%20Host\"&gt;Gray Host&lt;/a&gt;, among various other creatures. Much of the caverns' landscape, like the rest of Blackreach, is open and expansive, covered in mist and fog throughout. Bioluminescent biota, including giant mushrooms, are prevalent, providing ambient hues of blue, cyan and purple lighting.\nArkthzand Cavern is a smaller section of Blackreach than the ajoining Greymoor Caverns, and constitutes the subterranean area of Skyrim's Reach. Since their arrival in Skyrim and settlement of the lands around the &lt;a href=\"Karth%20River\"&gt;Karth River&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"Reachmen%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Reachmen&lt;/a&gt; have claimed the caverns as their sacred land, despite the dangers left behind following the dissapearance of the cavern's original inhabitant's, the Dwemer.\nLocations.\nThe following are locations accessible in Blackreach and, with the exception of &lt;a href=\"Unmarked%20Locations%20%28Online%29\"&gt;unmarked locations&lt;/a&gt;, are discoverable on the map. Points of Interest serve as locations with unique side quests, while &lt;a href=\"Cities%20%28Online%29\"&gt;cities&lt;/a&gt; serve as the centralised areas with multiple sublocations and act as a hub for services and &lt;a href=\"Merchants%20%28Online%29\"&gt;merchants&lt;/a&gt;. Explanations of the types of locations are provided in the &lt;a href=\"Locations%20%28Online%29%23Types\"&gt;main locations page&lt;/a&gt;.\nQuests.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Arkthzand%20Cavern\"&gt;Arkthzand Cavern&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Greymoor%20Caverns\"&gt;Greymoor Caverns&lt;/a&gt; sections of Blackreach share their story quests with the &lt;a href=\"The%20Reach%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Reach&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Western%20Skyrim\"&gt;Western Skyrim&lt;/a&gt; , respectively. The zone story quests tie into the Dark Heart of Skyrim's overarching storyline. Side quests are non-sequential and can be completed in any order, except where one carries on from another.\nItem Sets.\nItem sets are related armor and weapons that, when worn together, provide unique benefits. Overland sets can be acquired from world bosses, world events, delves, public dungeons and containers and as quest rewards; dungeon sets can be acquired from within group dungeons; monster sets can be acquired from the final boss of veteran group dungeons and Undaunted Enclaves; and crafted sets can be created at specific locations across the zone.\nSkyshards.\nNine Skyshards can be found in Blackreach totalling in three &lt;a href=\"skill%20points\"&gt;skill points&lt;/a&gt;. The zone guide provides clues as to the location of each Skyshard, but many can be found simply by exploring and watching for the distinctive pillar of light they emit. The two Skyshards in Arkthzand Cavern require the use of &lt;a href=\"Void%20Portals\"&gt;Void Portals&lt;/a&gt; that can be used without owning the &lt;a href=\"Void%20Shard\"&gt;Void Shard&lt;/a&gt;.\nAchievements.\nAchievements can be earned by completing specific tasks include quests and finding locations. Achievements are separated into categories and their progress is viewable from the journal. Earning achievement provides the Vestige some amount of points. Points earned only apply to the character that earned the achievement. Some achievements unlock unique rewards such as trophies or dyes.\nShalidor's Library.\nSixteen books that are a part of Shalidor's Library can be found in Blackreach and added to the collection. Books that have already been found in other zones will already be marked as completed in the zone tracker.\nFish.\nFish can be caught from fishing hotspots, ideally with the correct &lt;a href=\"bait\"&gt;bait&lt;/a&gt;. Common fish will be caught most often while rare fish and alternative bait are rare catches. Each zone has unique rare fish than can be caught from hotspots. &lt;a href=\"Slaughterfish%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Slaughterfish&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"trodh\"&gt;trodh&lt;/a&gt; can be caught from foul hotspots, &lt;a href=\"dhufish\"&gt;dhufish&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"longfin\"&gt;longfin&lt;/a&gt; can be caught from saltwater hotspots, &lt;a href=\"silverside%20perch\"&gt;silverside perch&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"spadetail\"&gt;spadetail&lt;/a&gt; can be caught from lake hotspots, and &lt;a href=\"Salmon%20%28Online%29\"&gt;salmon&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"River%20Betty%20%28Online%29\"&gt;river betty&lt;/a&gt; can be caught from river hotspots. &lt;a href=\"Chub\"&gt;Chub&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"minnow\"&gt;minnow&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"shad\"&gt;shad&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"fish%20roe\"&gt;fish roe&lt;/a&gt; can be caught and used as bait from foul, saltwater, lake and river hotspots, respectively."}

Grasping the true size of Blackreach is made difficult due to the teal haze and the mushroom spores which that float throughout the air. Massive geode stones and &lt;a href=\"geode%20vein\"&gt;geode vein&lt;/a&gt;s also dot the ground, and the pools of water found within are an almost entirely opaque teal.\nTypically, this location is encountered as part of the quest \"&lt;a href=\"Elder%20Knowledge\"&gt;Elder Knowledge&lt;/a&gt;.\" However, it is possible to discover it earlier, by initiating the quest \"&lt;a href=\"Discerning%20the%20Transmundane\"&gt;Discerning the Transmundane&lt;/a&gt;.\"\nHistory.\nSometime after &lt;a href=\"1E%20221\"&gt;1E 221&lt;/a&gt;, the Dwemer of &lt;a href=\"Skyrim\"&gt;Skyrim&lt;/a&gt; discovered a considerable amount of a raw mineral with considerable magical properties, which they referred to as &lt;a href=\"Aetherium%23Dwemer%20study\"&gt;Aetherium&lt;/a&gt;. The Dwemer quickly built four new cities, which were &lt;a href=\"Arkngthamz\"&gt;Arkngthamz&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Mzulft%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Mzulft&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Raldbthar\"&gt;Raldbthar&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Deep%20Folk%20Crossing\"&gt;Bthar-zel&lt;/a&gt; (now known as Deep Folk Crossing), which would work together to research this new mineral and develop new technologies forged from Aetherium.\nThe roles for this project were spread out between the four cities; Arkngthamz would serve as the project's command center and the primary research facility, Raldbthar (which happened to be located directly above Blackreach) would concern itself with mining operations, and Mzulft was used as a storage site. It is unknown what role Bthar-zel undertook in this project, though it is believed it was an experimentation facility. The city of &lt;a href=\"Bthalft\"&gt;Bthalft&lt;/a&gt; was not a part of the alliance, and it was used as the site for the &lt;a href=\"Aetherium%20Forge\"&gt;Aetherium Forge&lt;/a&gt;; a large, magma-infused forge which would be the basis for extremely advanced weapons, armor, tools, and other items that combined the great metalwork and engineering skills of the Dwemer and the innate magical powers of Aetherium.\nThe project was initially successful; with the alliance of the four cities bringing peace, harmony, and scientific and technological advancement to the Dwemer. However, after three years, the four cities began to yearn for independent control over the Aetherium, the Aetherium Forge and the incredible matter it could create.\nSublocations.\nThe following areas can be reached from Blackreach:\nNotable items.\nAlchemy ingredients.\n\"Because of the vast size of Blackreach, these figures may not be exhaustive.\""}

What followed afterward was years of bloody conflict, which would eventually become the &lt;a href=\"Interregnum\"&gt;Interregnum&lt;/a&gt;. His &lt;a href=\"Imperial%20Battlemage\"&gt;battlemage&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Pelladil%20Direnni\"&gt;Pelladil Direnni&lt;/a&gt; was sent to the region of Murkmire, to construct an Imperial Prison from the remains of ancient &lt;a href=\"Blackrose\"&gt;Blackrose&lt;/a&gt;, originally built from the extinct community of &lt;a href=\"Beastfolk\"&gt;Beastfolk&lt;/a&gt;, known as the &lt;a href=\"Lilmothiit\"&gt;Lilmothiit&lt;/a&gt;. Pelladil was able to create the stronghold within the matter of a single day, summoning an army of &lt;a href=\"Stone%20Atronach\"&gt;Stone Atronach&lt;/a&gt;s to create Blackrose Prison. Despite the very little time, it took to completion, the Rose became the most notorious prison, housing the worst criminals deemed so by the already decaying Empire. It was designed specifically for prisoners who wanted to escape. Those who traversed the confines of Black Marsh would never make it, either from the horrible environment, or the angry &lt;a href=\"Naga\"&gt;Naga&lt;/a&gt; tribes. Speaking of which, because of the Naga's rebellious nature, they made up a majority of the prisoners. Even after the fall of the &lt;a href=\"Second%20Empire\"&gt;Second Empire&lt;/a&gt;, the Blackrose Prison continued its reputation, never once falling, but there have been some occasions.\nAs time went on, the prisoner ratio of Imperials and Naga were increasing, and the infamy that Blackrose Prison had created was in jeopardy, considering the Naga and their accommodation in Murkmire. As Imperial control over Black Marsh decreased, Blackrose Prison was ultimately abandoned by the Second Empire, to which it was conquered by the &lt;a href=\"Blackguards\"&gt;Blackguards&lt;/a&gt;, a radical group of Naga that made up of the Rose's former prisoners, and their descendants. They swore to kill anyone who threatens Black Marsh, and so they have become hostile to outsiders, more so than the prominent Naga tribes, like the &lt;a href=\"Dead-Water%20Tribe\"&gt;Dead-Water Tribe&lt;/a&gt; or the &lt;a href=\"Bright-Throat%20Tribe\"&gt;Bright-Throat Tribe&lt;/a&gt;, both of whom are based in Murkmire. As time went on, the Blackguards, despite their original noble intentions, had become one of the largest criminal organizations in Black Marsh, bringing in non-Argonians, such as the Imperials of the former Blackrose Prison. The Blackguards remained for quite sometime, taking hold of Blackrose Prison as far as the &lt;a href=\"Alliance%20War\"&gt;Alliance War&lt;/a&gt;.\n&lt;a href=\"Third%20Era\"&gt;Third Era&lt;/a&gt;.\nIn the aftermath of the &lt;a href=\"Imperial%20Simulacrum\"&gt;Imperial Simulacrum&lt;/a&gt;, associates of &lt;a href=\"Jagar%20Tharn\"&gt;Jagar Tharn&lt;/a&gt;, that were not persecuted by the &lt;a href=\"Third%20Empire\"&gt;Third Empire&lt;/a&gt; were sentenced to the Blackrose Prison. Their time in the Rose was their last remaining years, when they were executed is currently unknown. However, in &lt;a href=\"3E%20432\"&gt;3E 432&lt;/a&gt;, a prison outbreak had occurred at Blackrose Prison, which resulted in several criminals escaping into the marsh. While the prison faculty covered the patches, and several prisoners returned into confinement, the outbreak has left many worried about their safe being, with corrupted and murderous individuals roaming freely. Although, there are some that believe they would not survive the marsh, considering that the Blackrose Prison is located relatively deep in the province, between Murkwood and Murkmire."}

It allows the &lt;a href=\"Vestige\"&gt;Vestige&lt;/a&gt; to use metal to create melee &lt;a href=\"Weapons%20%28Online%29\"&gt;weapons&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Heavy%20Armor%20%28Online%29\"&gt;heavy armor&lt;/a&gt;.\nOverview.\nAs with other crafting skills, it is necessary to extract raw materials into &lt;a href=\"Crafting%20Materials\"&gt;craftable ingredients&lt;/a&gt; before crafting with Blacksmithing. Metals are required and can be gathered throughout &lt;a href=\"Tamriel\"&gt;Tamriel&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Ore%20Veins%20%28Online%29\"&gt;ore veins&lt;/a&gt;. Once the metal has been extracted into ingots, the player may craft weapons and armors.\nTo use the Blacksmithing skill, players must use a &lt;a href=\"Blacksmithing%20Station\"&gt;Blacksmithing Station&lt;/a&gt;.\nEach craftable item has a minimum and maximum number of bars. For example, a cuirass may require a minimum of 7 iron bars, and take a maximum of 13. With each iron bar added to the 7, the armor value and level requirement increases.\nIt is also necessary for players to use crafting materials according to the &lt;a href=\"style\"&gt;style&lt;/a&gt; they wish to craft. By default they are only able to craft their own &lt;a href=\"Races%20%28Online%29\"&gt;race's&lt;/a&gt; style. Further styles can be unlocked by reading racial &lt;a href=\"Motifs\"&gt;style books&lt;/a&gt;. The necessary base materials may be purchased from any crafting &lt;a href=\"Merchants%20%28Online%29\"&gt;vendor&lt;/a&gt;.

The higher level the material, the better the results. For example, a steel sword will yield better results than an iron sword.\nMaterials can be obtained from &lt;a href=\"Ore%20Veins%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Ore Veins&lt;/a&gt;, found in any region. As of &lt;a href=\"Update%2012\"&gt;Update 12&lt;/a&gt;, Ore Veins are found throughout Tamriel 50% in the highest quality unlocked, and 50% corresponding to the &lt;a href=\"Vestige\"&gt;Vestige&lt;/a&gt;'s &lt;a href=\"character%20level\"&gt;character level&lt;/a&gt;. For example, with level 1 Metalworking and 160 , Ore Veins will be of &lt;a href=\"Rubedite%20Ore\"&gt;Rubedite Ore&lt;/a&gt; half the time, and &lt;a href=\"Iron%20Ore\"&gt;Iron Ore&lt;/a&gt; otherwise.\nList of materials:\nStyle.\nThe style of the armor is determined using &lt;a href=\"Style%20Materials\"&gt;Style Materials&lt;/a&gt;.\nTrait.\n&lt;a href=\"Traits\"&gt;Traits&lt;/a&gt; may be added to weapons and armors using particular &lt;a href=\"Traits%23Gemstones\"&gt;Gemstones&lt;/a&gt; after it has been researched.\nPassive abilities.\nEach crafting skill yields passive abilities related to the skill that can be levelled with the skill.

{"id": "618104", "revid": "32045548", "url": "https://elderscrolls.fandom.com/wiki?curid=618104", "title": "Blacksmithing Basics", "text": "Blacksmithing Basics is a &lt;a href=\"Books%20%28Online%29\"&gt;book&lt;/a&gt; in .\nContents.\nOrc forge-wives say they're the only ones who know how to &lt;a href=\"Blacksmithing\"&gt;smith&lt;/a&gt;. I say &lt;a href=\"Mudcrab%20%28Online%29\"&gt;mudcrabs&lt;/a&gt; to that! I'll show you how to find ore, extract ingots from the ore, explain crafting styles, and then teach you how to craft a weapon. Soon enough, you'll call yourself a blacksmith.\nStep 1: Get Some &lt;a href=\"Iron%20Ore%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Iron Ore&lt;/a&gt;\nIron ore is the simplest to work, and easy to replace if you make a mistake. Look for rusty, dull rock near big rock outcroppings. Then you mine it. If you don't mine it yourself, buy it from people who mine it, or ask a friend to loan you some. When you have ten chunks of iron ore, you're ready for the next step.\nStep 2: Refine Ingots\nFind a &lt;a href=\"blacksmithing%20station\"&gt;blacksmithing station&lt;/a&gt;. Then make iron ingots from your ten chunks of iron ore. This is called \"refinement.\" If you want to know why, ask a forge-wife.\nStep 3: Choose A Style\nEvery race has a style of blacksmithing, and each favors a traditional material. I call this a \"style material\" because it's easy to remember. The &lt;a href=\"Orsimer%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Orc&lt;/a&gt; style works best for me, but I'm an Orc. If you're a &lt;a href=\"Bretons%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Breton&lt;/a&gt;, start with material for the Breton style. Blacksmiths sell them, if you can't find them anywhere else.\nStep 4: Make An &lt;a href=\"Iron%20Dagger%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Iron Dagger&lt;/a&gt;\nIron daggers are easy to make. You need one style material, two &lt;a href=\"Iron%20Ingot%20%28Online%29\"&gt;iron ingots&lt;/a&gt;, and a steady hand with a hammer. When you have these things, find a blacksmithing station and craft an iron dagger. For better quality blades, use more ingots to make it. But for now, use two iron ingots.\nStep 5: Admire Your Iron Dagger\nTake a moment to admire your work. It's not \"just an iron dagger.\" You pulled metal from the ground and forged into a tool that can end lives. Respect what you've made.\nForge-wives won't be impressed with your iron dagger, but what do they know? You're a blacksmith if you do the work, not if you marry into it. Remember: iron daggers today, ebony greatswords tomorrow.\nAppendix: Advanced Smithing\nIf you really want to show up the forge-wives, you need to know more than just iron daggers.\nImproving Weapons and Armor\nUse a \"&lt;a href=\"temper\"&gt;temper&lt;/a&gt;\" to improve weapons and armor you've smithed. I call them that because I can never find one when I need it. This always makes me lose my temper.\nWhen you find one, bring it to a blacksmithing station with the item you want to improve. The more tempers you have, the greater the chance to improve the quality. But this is not a guarantee. If you do it wrong, you'll lose the tempers and the item.\nDeconstruction\nIf you're short on materials, you can deconstruct them from weapons or armor. You'll destroy the item when you break it down, and you'll only salvage part of what went into making it, but it's a quick way to get ingots.\nResearching Traits\nOne way to annoy a forge-wife is to buy her finest items, take them apart, and research the best traits of her weapons and armor. Then you can make copies of her best work and sell them for less. Do it all on her own blacksmithing station if you really want to make her angry."}

The war separated into three distinct Imperial campaigns, the &lt;a href=\"%23first%20campaign\"&gt;First&lt;/a&gt; of which was led by &lt;a href=\"Augurius%20Bucco\"&gt;Augurius Bucco&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"%23Second%20campaign\"&gt;second&lt;/a&gt; by &lt;a href=\"Regulus%20Sardecus\"&gt;Regulus Sardecus&lt;/a&gt;, and the &lt;a href=\"%23Third%20campaign\"&gt;third&lt;/a&gt; by &lt;a href=\"Lucinia%20Falco\"&gt;Lucinia Falco&lt;/a&gt;. Although the general aim of the war was unchanged throughout its nearly three-decade length, each campaign saw radically different strategies and events.\nFirst campaign.\nThe first campaign of the Blackwater War began in &lt;a href=\"1E%202811\"&gt;1E 2811&lt;/a&gt;. The &lt;a href=\"Fourth%20Legion\"&gt;Fourth Legion&lt;/a&gt;, led by young and popular commander &lt;a href=\"Augurius%20Bucco\"&gt;Augurius Bucco&lt;/a&gt;, saw several massive victories very early on, including a success at the &lt;a href=\"Battle%20of%20Argonia\"&gt;Battle of Argonia&lt;/a&gt;. These encouraged the Empire to launch a full-scale invasion of the province later that year, including the more congested, swampy interior. However, as the soldiers of the Fourth Legion progressed farther into Black Marsh's inhospitable swamps, they soon encountered numerous problems. Accustomed to fighting in the comparatively tame hills of &lt;a href=\"Cyrodiil\"&gt;Cyrodiil&lt;/a&gt;, the legionnaires found it difficult to defend themselves against their Argonian foes, who were already aware of how best to conduct military operations in the boggy, wet climate. Disease spread quickly among Imperial forces and was the leading cause of death in the first campaign, killing roughly half of the legionnaires.\nWhile the Argonian forces operated with ease, the Legion's heavy equipment was of little use in the jungle. Their armor tended to rust as a result of the wetness of the air, and huge amounts of mud slowed soldiers greatly by clinging to their boots and shields. By late &lt;a href=\"1E%202812\"&gt;1E 2812&lt;/a&gt;, these hindrances eventually led to much of the Imperial army simply not wearing their heavier cuirasses and greaves, which gave them more leeway in combat but left them with significantly less protection. Additionally, traditional Imperial battle tactics proved futile, as there was no way to effectively keep together organized cohorts of soldiers in the messy geography of central Black Marsh. Groups were frequently split apart and the chain of command lost, which allowed for the better-adjusted Argonian forces to quickly and easily defeat the Imperials. Insubordination and a general lack of morale among legionnaires soon followed.\nFive years into the war, in &lt;a href=\"1E%202816\"&gt;1E 2816&lt;/a&gt;, all but six cohorts of the entire Fourth Legion had perished. General Bucco called in a second legion from Cyrodiil in order to construct a paved road which was called &lt;a href=\"Reman%27s%20Way\"&gt;Reman's Way&lt;/a&gt;, or later &lt;a href=\"Swamp%20Road\"&gt;Swamp Road&lt;/a&gt;, to aid the war effort. The exact purposes of the road were equivocal, although if completed it would most likely have been used to move supplies and soldiers more quickly. However, due to a constant barrage of attacks from the Argonians, few defensive capabilities, and poor working conditions, the project was never more than half-finished.\nIn &lt;a href=\"1E%202820\"&gt;1E 2820&lt;/a&gt;, four years after \"&lt;a href=\"Bucco%27s%20Folly\"&gt;Bucco's Folly&lt;/a&gt;,\" as the failed road-building attempt was later dubbed, the Fourth Legion had been almost entirely killed off, save an estimated 350 exhausted troops. Bucco himself was almost removed from command via a mutiny, after which he fully realized the futility of his efforts and ordered the Imperial army to retreat from the innermost parts of Black Marsh. A ten-day march led the remnants of the legion to the ancient Argonian pyramid of &lt;a href=\"Xi-tsei\"&gt;Xi-tsei&lt;/a&gt;, where Bucco intended for his men to rest for a time and then fall back to Cyrodiil. However, the Argonians were able to quickly catch up to them. On the 14th of &lt;a href=\"Last%20Seed\"&gt;Last Seed&lt;/a&gt;, the Argonian forces completely annihilated the few Legion soldiers left alive.\nSecond campaign.\nAs a result of the catastrophic failure that was Augurius Bucco's campaign in Black Marsh, the &lt;a href=\"Imperial%20Council\"&gt;Imperial Council&lt;/a&gt; selected &lt;a href=\"Regulus%20Sardecus\"&gt;Regulus Sardecus&lt;/a&gt; as the new general of the Fourth Legion, which was rebuilt for a second invasion. While the young General Bucco had relatively little experience in combat prior to the war, General Sardecus had been involved in countless battles during his military career so far and was very highly regarded.\nSardecus' war strategy in Black Marsh's swamps was infinitely better-suited for the climate and terrain than Bucco's. Imperial soldiers were instructed to wear lighter, less constrictive padded leather instead of typical heavy metal Imperial armor to combat the ferocious heat and humidity of the region. Some non-hostile Argonians were consulted for the best methods on how to make use of the jungle's resources, and groups of soldiers were taught to operate in relative independence due to the constant fracturing of the army for increased efficiency and soldier morale. However, what most gave Sardecus' legion an advantage over Bucco's was the former's use of diplomacy in regards to \"disenfranchised\" Argonians, who could be bribed or otherwise convinced to fight on the side of the Imperials. By forging alliances with multiple native tribes such as the &lt;a href=\"Archeins\"&gt;Archeins&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Shoss-kaleel\"&gt;Shoss-kaleel&lt;/a&gt;, Sardecus was able to nearly triple his forces and regain all formerly lost territory by &lt;a href=\"1E%202823\"&gt;1E 2823&lt;/a&gt;.\nSardecus developed a unique strategy to combat Black Marsh's unruly terrain: destroy it. While Bucco and his legions had focused primarily on simply fighting the Argonians, it had not occurred to them that the Argonian's greatest advantage over them was their use of the land to their benefit. Sardecus, however, realized that he could cripple Argonian forces by simultaneously launching attacks and also draining swamps, salting rice paddies, and cutting down huge swaths of forest.\nThis strategy worked exceedingly well until the order came down from &lt;a href=\"Elissia%20Mallicius\"&gt;Elissia Mallicius&lt;/a&gt; to set ablaze a peat bog in the vicinity of &lt;a href=\"Stormhold\"&gt;Stormhold&lt;/a&gt;, far to the north. Although there was no reason to believe it would have any undesired effects, the peat bog in question was in fact part of a massive, interconnected network of underground tunnels, which would subsequently be set ablaze because of this. As a result, spontaneous fires were reported all across Black Marsh after several months, even as far away from Stormhold as &lt;a href=\"Gideon\"&gt;Gideon&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Soulrest\"&gt;Soulrest&lt;/a&gt;, in the southwestern part of the province. Quite some time passed before it was realized that a massive, province-wide fire was occurring. Historian &lt;a href=\"Valenca%20Arvina\"&gt;Valenca Arvina&lt;/a&gt; described the fires as \"an inferno of burning peat and detritus.\" Noxious gases and unpredictable eruptions and explosions completely obliterated the marsh's environment, and thousands of soldiers on both sides succumbed to the effects of what would be called the \"&lt;a href=\"Great%20Burn\"&gt;Great Burn&lt;/a&gt;\" of &lt;a href=\"1E%202828\"&gt;1E 2828&lt;/a&gt;, which lasted until at least &lt;a href=\"1E%202831\"&gt;1E 2831&lt;/a&gt;.\nGeneral Sardecus eventually ordered a full retreat from the province to avoid a greater number of casualties. However, before making it back to the &lt;a href=\"Imperial%20City\"&gt;Imperial City&lt;/a&gt;, he died of an infected wound. The source of this wound is, like many things in this war, contestable.\nThird campaign.\nA third and final general, &lt;a href=\"Lucinia%20Falco\"&gt;Lucinia Falco&lt;/a&gt;, took command of the Fourth Legion in approximately &lt;a href=\"1E%202833\"&gt;1E 2833&lt;/a&gt;. Her entire military career had been based in Black Marsh during the Blackwater War, having personally fought in the Battle of Argonia more than twenty years prior. She took Sardecus' new strategies another step forward and reached out to pirates around Black Marsh, whom she convinced to fight alongside a legion of &lt;a href=\"Diamond%20Marines\"&gt;Diamond Marines&lt;/a&gt; from Imperial ranks. Falco also further subdivided her troops into very small yet extremely effective platoons called \"&lt;a href=\"redbelts\"&gt;redbelts&lt;/a&gt;,\" each led by officers who had significant experience in the war already.\nThese groups were able to take over most of western Black Marsh with relative ease, but by the time they reached the deeper portions of the province they were slowed tremendously by the terrain once again. Additionally, due to the small size of these platoons, much conquered territory was quickly returned to the hands of the Argonians. The conflict turned into a bloody, terrifying, and very complicated guerrilla war by &lt;a href=\"1E%202834\"&gt;1E 2834&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe conflict ended abruptly and without an official declaration of peace in late &lt;a href=\"1E%202836\"&gt;1E 2836&lt;/a&gt; largely due to tribal infighting by the Argonians, who simply stopped fighting and returned to their former lives. By &lt;a href=\"1E%202837\"&gt;1E 2837&lt;/a&gt;, the Empire had claimed the entire province."}

Regardless of the absence of war, the region is greatly sought after by the &lt;a href=\"Imperials%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Imperials&lt;/a&gt; as well as the &lt;a href=\"Khajiit%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Khajiit&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Argonians%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Argonians&lt;/a&gt; on either side of its borders for its maritime opportunities.\nDuring the reign of the &lt;a href=\"Longhouse%20Emperors\"&gt;Longhouse Emperors&lt;/a&gt;, various \"Doomvaults\" were built in service to &lt;a href=\"Mehrunes%20Dagon\"&gt;Mehrunes Dagon&lt;/a&gt; for the purpose of bringing his plan to invade Tamriel to fruition. In &lt;a href=\"2E%20582\"&gt;2E 582&lt;/a&gt;, members of the &lt;a href=\"Order%20of%20the%20Waking%20Flame\"&gt;Order of the Waking Flame&lt;/a&gt; would begin to enact this plan, causing instability in the region and rising tensions between the Imperials and Argonians.\nBlackwood, although nominally a part of Cyrodiil, governs itself between the city-states of &lt;a href=\"Leyawiin%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Leyawiin&lt;/a&gt;, led by the &lt;a href=\"Chamber%20of%20Legates\"&gt;Chamber of Legates&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Gideon%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Gideon&lt;/a&gt;, led by Governor &lt;a href=\"Keshu%20the%20Black%20Fin\"&gt;Keshu the Black Fin&lt;/a&gt;. Since the collapse of the &lt;a href=\"Second%20Empire\"&gt;Empire&lt;/a&gt;, many of the former members of the &lt;a href=\"Elder%20Council\"&gt;Elder Council&lt;/a&gt; have fled to Blackwood and have either taken up an active role in the region's politics or have retired.\nLocations.\nThe following are locations accessible in Blackwood and, with the exception of &lt;a href=\"Unmarked%20Locations%20%28Online%29\"&gt;unmarked locations&lt;/a&gt;, are discoverable on the map. Points of Interest serve as locations with unique side quests, while &lt;a href=\"Cities%20%28Online%29\"&gt;cities&lt;/a&gt; serve as the centralised areas with multiple sublocations and act as a hub for services and &lt;a href=\"Merchants%20%28Online%29\"&gt;merchants&lt;/a&gt;. Explanations of the types of locations are provided in the &lt;a href=\"Locations%20%28Online%29%23Types\"&gt;main locations page&lt;/a&gt;.\nQuests.\nBlackwood features a series of zone story quests and unrelated side quests. The zone story quests tie into the &lt;a href=\"Gates%20of%20Oblivion\"&gt;Gates of Oblivion&lt;/a&gt; overarching storyline and continues on to the &lt;a href=\"The%20Deadlands%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Deadlands&lt;/a&gt;, but it is not necessary to complete the story quests for other zones prior to those in Blackwood. Side quests are non-sequential and can be completed in any order, except where one carries on from another, and &lt;a href=\"repeatable%20quests\"&gt;repeatable quests&lt;/a&gt; can be completed multiple times: weekly for arenas and trials and daily for all others.\nItem Sets.\nItem sets are related armor and weapons that, when worn together, provide unique benefits. Overland sets can be acquired from world bosses, world events, delves, public dungeons and containers and as quest rewards; dungeon sets can be acquired from within group dungeons; monster sets can be acquired from the final boss of veteran group dungeons and Undaunted Enclaves; and crafted sets can be created at specific locations across the zone.\nSkyshards.\nEighteen Skyshards can be found in Blackwood totaling in six &lt;a href=\"skill%20points\"&gt;skill points&lt;/a&gt;. The zone guide provides clues as to the location of each Skyshard, but many can be found simply by exploring and watching for the distinctive pillar of light they emit. Skyshards will appear on the map and compass when the Vestige is close to one and will remain discovered on the map even if it was not collected.\nAchievements.\nAchievements can be earned by completing specific tasks such as completing quests and discovering locations. Achievements are separated into categories and their progress is viewable from the journal. Earning achievement provides the Vestige a number of points, and some achievements unlock unique rewards such as &lt;a href=\"Furnishings%20%28Online%29\"&gt;furnishings&lt;/a&gt; that can be bought from Achievement Furnishers or &lt;a href=\"collectibles\"&gt;collectibles&lt;/a&gt;.\nShalidor's Library.\nTen books that are a part of Shalidor's Library can be found in Blackwood and added to the collection. Books that have already been found in other zones will already be marked as completed in the zone tracker.\nFish.\nFish can be caught from fishing hotspots, ideally with the correct &lt;a href=\"bait\"&gt;bait&lt;/a&gt;.

The Company mostly consists of &lt;a href=\"Khajiit%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;Khajiit&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Argonians%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;Argonians&lt;/a&gt;. The Company takes jobs the &lt;a href=\"Fighters%20Guild%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;Fighters Guild&lt;/a&gt; cannot or will not handle. They are reputed to accept any contract offered, to act recklessly and indiscriminately in their tactics, and to lack any screening process for new members. This is in contrast to the Fighters Guild who have a strict charter and set of rules to abide by. They are the main antagonists of the Fighters Guild &lt;a href=\"Quests%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;questline&lt;/a&gt;.\nHistory.\nOrigins.\nThe company originated in the swampy wetlands of &lt;a href=\"Black%20Marsh\"&gt;Black Marsh&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Blackwood\"&gt;Blackwood&lt;/a&gt; region of &lt;a href=\"Cyrodiil\"&gt;Cyrodiil&lt;/a&gt;. Many of mercenary groups existed in these swampy areas, but the Blackwood company quickly rose to the top. The group is known to take jobs that other mercenary groups would usually deny, such as guarding a &lt;a href=\"Skooma\"&gt;Skooma&lt;/a&gt; kingpin.\nExpansion.\nThey quickly expanded into Cyrodiil and made their Cyrodiil headquarters in &lt;a href=\"Leyawiin%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;Leyawiin&lt;/a&gt;. Blackwood quickly controlled the mercenary market in southeastern Cyrodiil and Black Marsh. This was quick to anger the main mercenary group known as the &lt;a href=\"Fighters%20Guild\"&gt;Fighters Guild&lt;/a&gt; in Cyrodiil.\nSecrets uncovered and destruction.\nBy the time of the Oblivion Crisis, the company was composed of mostly Khajiit and Argonians. They were the most prominent and the richest group of mercenaries in the Blackwood Forest. This put them at odds with the Fighters Guild, another mercenary guild. As a result, a private investigation was done by &lt;a href=\"Modryn%20Oreyn%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;Modryn Oreyn&lt;/a&gt; with the &lt;a href=\"Hero%20of%20Kvatch\"&gt;Hero of Kvatch&lt;/a&gt; as the investigator. In the quest \"&lt;a href=\"Infiltration%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;Infiltration&lt;/a&gt;\" the Hero investigates the Blackwood Company and finds out that they are using &lt;a href=\"Hist%20Sap%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;Hist Sap&lt;/a&gt; to give company members a \"boost.\" Hist Sap is the sap of the tree called &lt;a href=\"Hist\"&gt;Hist&lt;/a&gt; from the Argonian homeland of &lt;a href=\"Black%20Marsh\"&gt;Black Marsh&lt;/a&gt;. Argonians are immune to the negative effects, but non-Argonians will experience negative and often violent effects. This is why it is declared as an illegal drug like &lt;a href=\"Skooma%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;Skooma&lt;/a&gt;. The Hero cannot obtain any Hist Sap after the quest.\nHow to join.\nThe Blackwood Company is only joinable as part of the Fighters Guild questline. They have only two ranks, of which only one is available to the &lt;a href=\"Hero%20of%20Kvatch\"&gt;Hero&lt;/a&gt;:\nBlackwood Company Hall.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Blackwood%20Company%20Hall\"&gt;Blackwood Company Hall&lt;/a&gt; is in &lt;a href=\"Leyawiin%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;Leyawiin&lt;/a&gt; across a plaza from its competition the Fighters Guild. There is a display case containing a &lt;a href=\"Blackwood%20shield\"&gt;Blackwood shield&lt;/a&gt;, a heavy shield bearing the Blackwood Company crest, and also a &lt;a href=\"Silver%20War%20Axe%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;silver war axe&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Silver%20Shortsword%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;silver shortsword&lt;/a&gt; crossed at the hilt to resemble the same crest.\nThe second floor of the &lt;a href=\"Blackwood%20Company%20Hall\"&gt;Blackwood Company Hall&lt;/a&gt; has a &lt;a href=\"Nirnroot%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;Nirnroot&lt;/a&gt; in a plant pot on the mezzanine.

Daggers do little physical damage but can be swung extremely fast. A good tactic with a dagger is to enchant it, and then strike repeatedly allowing the cast on strike effect to activate multiple times. This tactic can dish out large amounts of damage quickly, but rapidly drains your weapon's magic meter. Long Blades are favored by \"sword and board\" (fighting with a sword and a shield) players. Claymores swing faster than Warhammers or Battle Axes but are less likely to cause your opponent to stagger because they do less damage. General swords are advised for use with lesser melee oriented classes i.e. rogues, mages, and marksmen."}

Members of the Blades Guard defended the Dragonborn Emperors, while other members of the Blades were spies, with their own professions. Stealing or attacking a Blades member results in the offender being permanently expelled from the organization.\nHistory.\n&lt;a href=\"Second%20Era\"&gt;Second Era&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe Blades would find their origin at some point during the Second Era. Though few accounts of their duties in this time exist, some history regarding their service under &lt;a href=\"Tiber%20Septim\"&gt;Tiber Septim&lt;/a&gt; is found. The Blades had aided General Tiber Septim during the &lt;a href=\"Battle%20of%20Sancre%20Tor\"&gt;Battle of Sancre Tor&lt;/a&gt;, and for their aid in this victory, the General rewarded them with his armor. The Blades would construct a shrine within Sancre Tor, at the location where Tiber Septim gained the blessing of Akatosh, and the armor was kept there as a relic, and many Blades would make a pilgrimage to the shrine. Sometime during the reign of Tiber Septim, however, the &lt;a href=\"Underking\"&gt;Underking&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Zurin%20Arctus\"&gt;Zurin Arctus&lt;/a&gt;, had placed a curse on the shrine. In response, the four mightiest Blades of the time were sent out for Sancre Tor to cleanse it, but never returned. As such, the first Grandmaster of the Blades sealed the ruins.\n&lt;a href=\"Third%20Era\"&gt;Third Era&lt;/a&gt;.\nImperial Invasion of Akavir.\nBefore the Imperial Invasion of &lt;a href=\"Akavir\"&gt;Akavir&lt;/a&gt; took place under the command of &lt;a href=\"Uriel%20Septim%20V\"&gt;Uriel Septim V&lt;/a&gt;, the Blades were tasked with obtaining information regarding the land. From this collected information, the landing site would be chosen as the lands of the &lt;a href=\"Tsaesci\"&gt;Tsaesci&lt;/a&gt;. The Blades had, however, failed to collect sufficient information, as the weather plagued the &lt;a href=\"Expeditionary%20Force\"&gt;Expeditionary Force&lt;/a&gt;. The Blades had also failed to properly record the strength of the Tsaesci; as they were much stronger than their reports had suggested. The Invasion of Akavir would fail, and Uriel Septim V would end up dead by the end of it.\n&lt;a href=\"Miracle%20of%20Peace\"&gt;Miracle of Peace&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe Blades would write an account on the Miracle of Peace, which concerned the &lt;a href=\"Iliac%20Bay\"&gt;Iliac Bay&lt;/a&gt; region. The Blades concluded there was no plausible explanation for the events that took place, and thus thought a miracle must have been responsible. &lt;a href=\"The%20Agent\"&gt;A Blades agent&lt;/a&gt; was directly involved with the &lt;a href=\"Totem%20of%20Tiber%20Septim\"&gt;Totem of Tiber Septim&lt;/a&gt;, which played a role in the Miracle. However, the Blades lost contact with this Agent immediately after the miracle had taken place. Other Agents had also been present in the region, but only few reports came to exist. Many Blades agents were lost in dislocations during the Miracle, while others were lost in the confusion following it.\n&lt;a href=\"Dagoth%20Ur%20%28Character%29\"&gt;Dagoth Ur&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe Blades would be somewhat involved with the crisis surrounding &lt;a href=\"Dagoth%20Ur%20%28Character%29\"&gt;Dagoth Ur&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href=\"Caius%20Cosades\"&gt;Caius Cosades&lt;/a&gt;, the spymaster of &lt;a href=\"Vvardenfell\"&gt;Vvardenfell&lt;/a&gt; District of &lt;a href=\"Morrowind\"&gt;Morrowind&lt;/a&gt;, was tasked with making a recently arrived prisoner appear as the &lt;a href=\"Nerevarine\"&gt;Nerevarine&lt;/a&gt;. This prisoner would be initiated into the Blades when they reported to Caius. Following a number of tasks, this agent was made aware that the reason they had been set free was because they appeared to have matched the conditions of the Nerevarine by the Emperor. This Blades Agent would continue to complete the Nerevarine Prophecy, and defeat Dagoth Ur. He would also participate in the &lt;a href=\"Bloodmoon%20Prophecy\"&gt;Bloodmoon Prophecy&lt;/a&gt; and defeat &lt;a href=\"Hircine\"&gt;Hircine&lt;/a&gt; in his Hunt. Likewise, the Nerevarine would also kill &lt;a href=\"Almalexia\"&gt;Almalexia&lt;/a&gt; after she had become mad.\n&lt;a href=\"Oblivion%20Crisis\"&gt;Oblivion Crisis&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe Blades saw some action during the Oblivion Crisis. Three members of the Blades Guard, &lt;a href=\"Glenroy\"&gt;Glenroy&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Baurus\"&gt;Baurus&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Captain%20Renault\"&gt;Captain Renault&lt;/a&gt; were originally tasked with getting Emperor &lt;a href=\"Uriel%20Septim%20VII\"&gt;Uriel Septim VII&lt;/a&gt; to safety following assassination attempts on his sons. Their escape route went through the &lt;a href=\"Imperial%20Prison\"&gt;Imperial Prison&lt;/a&gt;, and at the cell with a secret tunnel, &lt;a href=\"Hero%20of%20Kvatch\"&gt;a prisoner&lt;/a&gt; had been placed by the Imperial Watch. As such, this prisoner was permitted to follow the Emperor and his guards.\nShortly afterward, the Blades would be ambushed by assassins, resulting in the death of Captain Renault. The assassins were fought off, however, and the Blades continued to escort the Emperor while demanding the prisoner should remain put. The prisoner would follow them, however, going through a hidden cave system within the prison, they were reunited with the Blades. Glenroy suspected the prisoner was working with the assassins, but the Emperor trusted the prisoner through divine visions and told his guards to stand down. The group would continue through the secret passageway, killing assassins along the way, until they came to a dead end. Here, both Glenroy and the Emperor would die at the hands of the assassins, only leaving Baurus and the prisoner. Before the Emperor died, however, he gave the &lt;a href=\"Amulet%20of%20Kings\"&gt;Amulet of Kings&lt;/a&gt; to the prisoner and told them to find &lt;a href=\"Jauffre%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;Jauffre&lt;/a&gt;. Baurus provided the prisoner with directions and trusted them to do their duty with delivering the Amulet, since the Emperor had trusted them. This failure to defend the Emperor was met with a great dislike for the Blades among members of the &lt;a href=\"Imperial%20Legion\"&gt;Imperial Legion&lt;/a&gt;, due to the Blades having been trusted with the protection of their leader, and failing.\nWhen Jauffre, the Grandmaster of the Blades at the time, was given the Amulet of Kings, he tasked the Prisoner with finding the Emperor's illegitimate last son, &lt;a href=\"Martin%20Septim\"&gt;Martin Septim&lt;/a&gt;. Martin was a priest at the &lt;a href=\"Chapel%20of%20Akatosh\"&gt;Chapel of Akatosh&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Kvatch\"&gt;Kvatch&lt;/a&gt;, which had been overrun by a Daedric horde. Martin himself, however, refused to leave the ruined city until the &lt;a href=\"Oblivion%20Gate\"&gt;Oblivion Gate&lt;/a&gt; outside of the city had been dealth with. After successfully dealing with the Daedric threat, Martin agreed to follow the Hero to Weynon Priory.\nThe Priory, however, was under attack by assassins, who had come to steal the Amulet of Kings. After Jauffre and the Hero of Kvatch had taken care of the assassins, the Amulet was discovered to have been stolen. As such, it was decided that Martin would not be safe at Weynon Priory, and was instead taken to Cloud Ruler Temple.\nWith Martin safe and the Amulet stolen, the Blades returned to their duties. Baurus, who had been tasked with defending the Emperor, had discovered the ones responsible for the assassination were members of the Mythic Dawn, who are followers of &lt;a href=\"Mehrunes%20Dagon\"&gt;Mehrunes Dagon&lt;/a&gt;. Following a failed assassination attempt on Baurus himself, deeper investigation would take place. The &lt;a href=\"Astav%20Wirich\"&gt;assassin&lt;/a&gt; held a copy of the first volume of the &lt;a href=\"Mythic%20Dawn%20Commentaries\"&gt;Mythic Dawn Commentaries&lt;/a&gt;, and through collaboration with a &lt;a href=\"Tar-Meena\"&gt;member&lt;/a&gt; of the &lt;a href=\"Mages%20Guild\"&gt;Mages Guild&lt;/a&gt;, more information regarding the recruiting process of the Mythic Dawn was acquired. The Blades would use this information to infiltrate during a recruiting to obtain the Fourth Volume of the Commentaries. With all four Commentaries, the &lt;a href=\"Lake%20Arrius%20Caverns\"&gt;secret hideout&lt;/a&gt; of the Mythic Dawn was discovered.\nThis hideout would be infiltrated by the Hero of Kvatch in order to obtain the Amulet of Kings. While the Hero of Kvatch failed to recover the Amulet, they did obtain the &lt;a href=\"Mysterium%20Xarxes\"&gt;Mysterium Xarxes&lt;/a&gt;, and would have to fight their way out of the caverns. The Mysterium Xarxes would be given to Martin, who began to study it in hopes of discovering a means of creating a portal to Mankar Camoran's Paradise. Meanwhile, Jauffre had heard rumors of spies in Bruma, so the Hero was set to aid in this regard. It would turn out two spies of the Mythic Dawn operated out of Bruma, and had discovered that Martin Septim had made his home at Cloud Ruler Temple, which was worrying news for the Blades.\nAfterwards, the Hero of Kvatch would need to obtain four items in order to allow Martin the ability to create a portal to Paradise. The first being a Daedric Artifact, the second being the blood of a divine, for which blood from the &lt;a href=\"Armor%20of%20Tiber%20Septim\"&gt;Armor of Tiber Septim&lt;/a&gt; was used, and the third was a &lt;a href=\"Great%20Welkynd%20Stone\"&gt;Great Welkynd Stone&lt;/a&gt; from &lt;a href=\"Miscarcand%20%28Location%29\"&gt;Miscarcand&lt;/a&gt;. The fourth and final object required was a &lt;a href=\"Great%20Sigil%20Stone%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;Great Sigil Stone&lt;/a&gt;. To obtain this item, however, a Great Gate would require to be opened outside of Bruma. As such, aid was gathered from around Cyrodiil itself in order to defend the city. The Hero of Kvatch would enter the Great Gate and obtain its Sigil Stone, providing Martin with the final required ingredient.\nWith all four ingredients, Martin created a portal to &lt;a href=\"Paradise%20%28Location%29\"&gt;Paradise&lt;/a&gt;. Here, the Hero of Kvatch would fight their way through Daedra until they arrived at &lt;a href=\"Mankar%20Camoran\"&gt;Mankar Camoran&lt;/a&gt; himself. A battle would take place, and the Hero would come out victorious, taking the Amulet of Kings back to Tamriel. Back in Tamriel, Martin was provided with the Amulet, and an attempt at relighting the Dragonfires would quickly be made in order to turn the tides. However, before Martin could be crowned Emperor and reach the &lt;a href=\"Temple%20of%20the%20One\"&gt;Temple of the One&lt;/a&gt;, Mehrunes Dagon himself had entered Tamriel, rendering the Covenant between &lt;a href=\"Akatosh\"&gt;Akatosh&lt;/a&gt; and the Amulet of Kings void. Still, Martin decided to smash the Amulet, turning into an avatar of Akatosh, defeating Dagon in combat. After this, the Blades fortified themselves within Cloud Ruler Temple, and awaited the return of a new Dragonborn to serve.\n&lt;a href=\"Fourth%20Era\"&gt;Fourth Era&lt;/a&gt;.\nAs of the Fourth Era, the Blades no longer answered to the Empire of Tamriel, as they were not an arm of the Imperial government, and only answered to the Dragonborn. They had since been replaced by the &lt;a href=\"Penitus%20Oculatus\"&gt;Penitus Oculatus&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe Blades were one of the first to recognize the &lt;a href=\"Thalmor\"&gt;Thalmor&lt;/a&gt; as a threat to the other nations of Tamriel. Before the Great War, the Grandmaster of the Blades saw the Thalmor as the greatest threat to Tamriel, and as such, the Empire and Blades worked alongside one another to weaken the Thalmor. The Blades believed themselves to be more than a match for the Thalmor, and so fought them in the shadows. The Blades at the time were obsessed with the Thalmor, and believed that they would form a threat towards the next &lt;a href=\"Last%20Dragonborn\"&gt;Dragonborn&lt;/a&gt;. Some of the damaging operations of the Blades were an operation carried out in &lt;a href=\"Falinesti\"&gt;Falinesti&lt;/a&gt; and a prison break within Dominion lands. The Blades would later be killed off in the lands of the Dominion before the Great War broke out, an event even the Blades themselves did not see coming.\n&lt;a href=\"Great%20War\"&gt;Great War&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe Thalmor were aware that the Blades were an enemy to them during the Great War. As such, the Thalmor killed off the majority of their forces during the war, by besieging the Blades Temples and killing agents in the field. The Blades had fatally underestimated the Thalmor forces, and were destroyed with ease during the Great War. Only one Blades member survived the siege on Cloud Ruler Temple, named &lt;a href=\"Acilius%20Bolar\"&gt;Acilius Bolar&lt;/a&gt;. This agent would flee to Skyrim and hide in &lt;a href=\"Bloated%20Man%27s%20Grotto\"&gt;Bloated Man's Grotto&lt;/a&gt;, where the Thalmor would eventually find, and kill him.\nOne member of the Blades, known as &lt;a href=\"Tyr\"&gt;Tyr&lt;/a&gt; would aid &lt;a href=\"The%20Forgotten%20Hero\"&gt;The Forgotten Hero&lt;/a&gt; during the Great War in their campaign against &lt;a href=\"Lord%20Naarifin\"&gt;Lord Naarifin&lt;/a&gt;. The Hero and his companions would discover the source of the Dominion's ability to discover the Emperor's every move was done through the &lt;a href=\"Orb%20of%20Vaermina\"&gt;Orb of Vaermina&lt;/a&gt;, and they would end this. It is unknown if Tyr survived the encounter with &lt;a href=\"Reive\"&gt;Reive&lt;/a&gt;, Lord Naarifin's Dremora servant.\nAt the end of the war, &lt;a href=\"Titus%20Mede%20II\"&gt;Titus Mede II&lt;/a&gt; signed the &lt;a href=\"White-Gold%20Concordat\"&gt;White-Gold Concordat&lt;/a&gt;, which officially disbanded the Blades.\n&lt;a href=\"Dragon%20Crisis\"&gt;Dragon Crisis&lt;/a&gt;.\nDuring the Dragon Crisis, the Blades would find a new purpose. &lt;a href=\"Delphine\"&gt;Delphine&lt;/a&gt;, a member of the Blades, would take the &lt;a href=\"Horn%20of%20Jurgen%20Windcaller\"&gt;Horn of Jurgen Windcaller&lt;/a&gt; from his grave in &lt;a href=\"Ustengrav\"&gt;Ustengrav&lt;/a&gt; after the &lt;a href=\"Greybeards\"&gt;Greybeards&lt;/a&gt; had summoned the Last Dragonborn. Delphine did this as she wanted to find the Dragonborn, to guide and serve them as they are sworn to do. After the Last Dragonborn had defeated\u00a0&lt;a href=\"Sahloknir\"&gt;Sahloknir&lt;/a&gt;, they began working alongside the Blades to end the Dragon Crisis. Delphine was certain the Thalmor were related to the return of the &lt;a href=\"Dragons%20%28Lore%29\"&gt;Dragons&lt;/a&gt;, as the return of &lt;a href=\"Alduin\"&gt;Alduin&lt;/a&gt; had prevented the execution of &lt;a href=\"Ulfric%20Stormcloak\"&gt;Ulfric Stormcloak&lt;/a&gt;, the leader of the &lt;a href=\"Stormcloaks\"&gt;Stormcloaks&lt;/a&gt;.\nDelphine would then task the Dragonborn with infiltrating the &lt;a href=\"Thalmor%20Embassy%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Thalmor Embassy&lt;/a&gt;, as she was convinced the Thalmor were related to the return of the Dragons, however, it would turn out the Thalmor knew nothing about the return of the Dragons. Despite this, they were searching for &lt;a href=\"Esbern%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Esbern&lt;/a&gt;, a Blades agent who knew the lore of the dragons.\nWhile the Dragonborn was searching for Esbern, the Thalmor had dispatched units in order to find and capture Esbern, as well as kill the Dragonborn. Esbern was originally paranoid when he was found by the Dragonborn, as he was certain that the world was about to end due to the return of &lt;a href=\"Alduin\"&gt;Alduin&lt;/a&gt;. The Dragonborn eventually convinced Esbern that they were the Dragonborn of prophecy, and Esbern followed them to Delphine.\nWhen the two were reunited, Esbern shared his knowledge regarding Sky Haven Temple, and &lt;a href=\"Alduin%27s%20Wall\"&gt;Alduin's Wall&lt;/a&gt;, within &lt;a href=\"The%20Reach\"&gt;The Reach&lt;/a&gt;. Esbern hoped that Alduin's Wall would provide the Dragonborn with the required knowledge to defeat Alduin. At the Wall, it would be discovered that a &lt;a href=\"Dragon%20Shouts\"&gt;Shout&lt;/a&gt; was needed to defeat Alduin. Due to the Dragonborn not knowing which Shout was needed, they went to the Greybeards to learn it. Delphine made clear that she had a dislike for the Greybeards, due to her fearing that they would turn the Dragonborn away from their destiny.\nThe Dragonborn would have to find an &lt;a href=\"Elder%20Scroll%20%28Dragon%29\"&gt;Elder Scroll&lt;/a&gt; in order to learn the &lt;a href=\"Dragonrend\"&gt;Shout&lt;/a&gt; that was used. With the knowledge of this Shout, the Dragonborn defeated Alduin atop the &lt;a href=\"Throat%20of%20the%20World\"&gt;Throat of the World&lt;/a&gt;, but Alduin fled to Sovngarde after being defeated, to regain his strength. As such, Esbern proposed the usage of &lt;a href=\"Dragonsreach\"&gt;Dragonsreach&lt;/a&gt; in order to capture a Dragon to bring the Dragonborn to Sovngarde. The Jarl of Whiterun would agree, but only following a truce was made between the &lt;a href=\"Imperial%20Legion\"&gt;Imperial Legion&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Stormcloaks\"&gt;Stormcloaks&lt;/a&gt;.\nAfter the peace council, it would become clear that the Blades had learned who the leader of the Greybeards was. &lt;a href=\"Paarthurnax\"&gt;Paarthurnax&lt;/a&gt;, a Dragon and former lieutenant of Alduin during the &lt;a href=\"Dragon%20War\"&gt;Dragon War&lt;/a&gt;, thousands of years prior. While Paarthurnax was defended by the Greybeards and the Dragonborn Emperors, preventing the Blades from killing him. This time, however, the Blades refused to serve the Dragonborn until the Dragonborn killed Paarthurnax. Despite this demand going against their duty as a member of the Blades.\nIf the Dragonborn slays Paarthurnax, the Blades would slowly be rebuilt, with Sky Haven Temple serving as their headquarters. The Blades would now return to the deeds of their predecessors; the Dragonguard, being more focused on killing Dragons. The Blades would use the &lt;a href=\"Dragon%20Bone%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Dragon Bones&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Dragon%20Scales%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Dragon Scales&lt;/a&gt; in the creation of a potion which would decrease the damage a Dragon dealt."}

After &lt;a href=\"Cuhlecain\"&gt;Cuhlecain&lt;/a&gt;'s death, Tiber Septim became Emperor and the Blades became his bodyguards, and they served the Emperors of Tamriel until the &lt;a href=\"Fourth%20Era\"&gt;Fourth Era&lt;/a&gt;. The Blades fought in several wars throughout history, most notably the &lt;a href=\"Oblivion%20Crisis\"&gt;Oblivion Crisis&lt;/a&gt;. They had secret branches across Tamriel, gathering intelligence on the Emperor's enemies. Fiercely loyal to the Emperor himself, the Elder Council held no power over them. The Blades also served in a public light as the Emperor's bodyguards.\nHistory.\nBattle of Sancre Tor.\nIn 2E 852, allied &lt;a href=\"Nord\"&gt;Nord&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Breton\"&gt;Breton&lt;/a&gt; forces crossed the borders into &lt;a href=\"Cyrodiil\"&gt;Cyrodiil&lt;/a&gt; and occupied the major passes and settlements in the &lt;a href=\"Jerall%20Mountains\"&gt;Jerall Mountains&lt;/a&gt;. Making their headquarters for the winter at &lt;a href=\"Sancre%20Tor\"&gt;Sancre Tor&lt;/a&gt;, the Nord-Breton allies dared &lt;a href=\"Talos\"&gt;Talos&lt;/a&gt;, King Cuhlecain's new general, to assault them in their mountain defenses.\nWhen they learned that General Talos had mustered an army in the dead of winter and was marching to assault Sancre Tor, they were elated. Sancre Tor was Impregnable, its citadel on high cliffs overlooking the lower city, nestled in a high mountain basin with steep, Unscalable cliffs in their rear.\nThe Cyrodilic army was small, poorly trained and outfitted, short on rations, and unprepared for winter campaigning. As their ragged units assembled in the lowlands beneath the citadel, the Nord-Breton allies confidently assumed that their enemy had delivered himself into their trap.\nThe citadel was not only protected by an unscalable cliff in front and unscalable heights in their rear, but the entrance to the citadel was magically concealed under the appearance of a large mountain lake in the basin beneath the heights. Accordingly, the Nord-Breton allies left on a small force to defend the citadel, descending through lower passages to attack and overwhelm the cold, hungry Cyrodilic forces before them. They expected to defeat, overrun, and annihilate General Talos' army, leaving no one to oppose their springtime descent into the Cyrodilic Heartlands.\nLeaving a weak force in the lowlands to draw out the defenders, General Talos approached the citadel of Sancre Tor from the rear, descending the supposedly unscalable heights behind the citadel, and sneaking into the magically concealed entrance to the inner citadel. This remarkable feat is attributed to a Breton turncoat sorcerer, who revealed both the existence of an obscure mountain trail down the heights behind the citadel and the secret of the citadel entrance concealed beneath its illusory lake surface.\nWhile the Cyrodilic army in the lowlands fought a desperate defense against the Nord-Breton sortie, General Talos and the Blades entered the citadel, swept aside the sparse defense, captured the Nord-Breton nobles and generals, and compelled them to surrender the citadel and their armies. The confused and demoralized Nord captives, deserted the alliance and swore loyalty to Tiber Septim. The High Rock generals were executed and the captive Bretons imprisoned or sold into slavery.\nOblivion Crisis.\nDuring the &lt;a href=\"Oblivion%20Crisis\"&gt;Oblivion Crisis&lt;/a&gt;, the Blades played an important role in the defeat of &lt;a href=\"Mehrunes%20Dagon\"&gt;Mehrunes Dagon&lt;/a&gt;, the Daedric prince of destruction, after the death of the &lt;a href=\"Emperor\"&gt;Emperor&lt;/a&gt;. The prisoner who would become the Hero of Kvatch after receiving the &lt;a href=\"Amulet%20of%20Kings%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;Amulet of Kings&lt;/a&gt; from Emperor &lt;a href=\"Uriel%20Septim%20VII\"&gt;Uriel Septim VII&lt;/a&gt; took it to &lt;a href=\"Jauffre%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;Jauffre&lt;/a&gt;, the Grandmaster of the Blades, and was subsequently sent to find and rescue the last heir to the throne, &lt;a href=\"Martin%20Septim%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;Martin Septim&lt;/a&gt;, and later the Amulet of Kings after the &lt;a href=\"Mythic%20Dawn\"&gt;Mythic Dawn&lt;/a&gt; stole it from &lt;a href=\"Weynon%20Priory%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;Weynon Priory&lt;/a&gt;. The Blades participated in the Second Battle of Bruma and the Battle of the Imperial City. After the sacrifice of Martin Septim and the end of the Oblivion Crisis the Blades were once again without an Emperor to protect and eventually aided the &lt;a href=\"Elder%20Council\"&gt;Elder Council&lt;/a&gt; to stabilize the Empire.\nArtifacts.\nThe Blades have acquired several artifacts over their long history.

The few remnants of this once-glorious order have gone into hiding and are being hunted by the &lt;a href=\"Thalmor%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Thalmor&lt;/a&gt; after their near-extermination by the &lt;a href=\"Aldmeri%20Dominion%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Aldmeri Dominion&lt;/a&gt;.\nHistory.\nOrigins.\nThe story of the Blades begins with the &lt;a href=\"Akaviri\"&gt;Akaviri&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Akaviri%20Invasions\"&gt;invasion&lt;/a&gt; during the &lt;a href=\"First%20Era\"&gt;First Era&lt;/a&gt;. After the Akaviri forces had fought through &lt;a href=\"Skyrim\"&gt;Skyrim&lt;/a&gt; and reached the &lt;a href=\"Pale%20Pass\"&gt;Pale Pass&lt;/a&gt;, they were met by &lt;a href=\"Reman%20Cyrodiil\"&gt;Reman Cyrodiil&lt;/a&gt; and his forces. It is said that after hearing the Emperor's \"voice\" or Dragon Shout, the Akaviri forces knelt and swore fealty to him, whom they called &lt;a href=\"Dragonborn%20%28Lore%29\"&gt;Dragonborn&lt;/a&gt;. They later formed the order that is now known as the Blades.\nThe true reasons for their invasion remains a mystery, though it is mentioned that they may have been looking for a new Dragonborn to serve or hunting down the dragons that escaped their continent.\nDownfall.\nThe Oblivion Crisis marked the beginning of the downfall of the Blades. With the death of &lt;a href=\"Uriel%20Septim%20VII\"&gt;Uriel Septim VII&lt;/a&gt; and his sons, the &lt;a href=\"Third%20Era\"&gt;Third Era&lt;/a&gt; came to a close. With no Dragonborn ruler to serve, the order fortified themselves in &lt;a href=\"Cloud%20Ruler%20Temple\"&gt;Cloud Ruler Temple&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe Blades' role as the Emperor's guards was relegated to the &lt;a href=\"Penitus%20Oculatus%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Penitus Oculatus&lt;/a&gt;, but the Blades continued to work in secret, watching for a new Dragonborn and guarding the &lt;a href=\"Third%20Empire\"&gt;Empire&lt;/a&gt;. The Blades were among the first to see the growing threat of the Thalmor and the Aldmeri Dominion. Unlike the Penitus Oculatus, the Blades were not bound to Imperial policy and could operate freely. This earned the lasting hatred of the Thalmor.\nThough skilled and numerous, the Blades severely underestimated the Thalmor. By the beginning of the Great War, every single Blades agent stationed within the Aldmeri Dominion had been detected and executed, with their severed heads being presented to Emperor Titus Mede II as the opening declaration of war. In addition to these heavy losses, the Aldmeri Dominion forces laid siege to the order's ancient fortress of Cloud Ruler Temple, ultimately destroying it completely.\nLate in &lt;a href=\"4E%20175\"&gt;4E 175&lt;/a&gt;, the Empire and the Aldmeri Dominion signed the &lt;a href=\"White-Gold%20Concordat\"&gt;White-Gold Concordat&lt;/a&gt;, ending the Great War. One of the requirements of the Concordat was the disbandment of the Blades, thus ending the order's public face and forcing them into hiding.\nHeadquarters.\n Throughout their history, the Blades were known to have their headquarters in Cloud Ruler Temple, in &lt;a href=\"Cyrodiil\"&gt;Cyrodiil&lt;/a&gt;. Unfortunately, sometime during the Great War, the temple was destroyed by a Thalmor siege and nearly all members of the defending Blades were slain.\nDuring the Dragon Crisis, the remaining members of Blades in Skyrim found refuge in &lt;a href=\"Sky%20Haven%20Temple\"&gt;Sky Haven Temple&lt;/a&gt;. It was there where, with the help of the new Dragonborn, the rebirth of the order began.\nSky Haven Temple was built by the Akavir themselves. It served as an outpost during the Akaviri invasion during the late First Era. After the war, the temple was visited by &lt;a href=\"Reman%20II\"&gt;Reman II&lt;/a&gt; himself. In the presence of all the &lt;a href=\"Blades%23History\"&gt;Dragonguard&lt;/a&gt;, he created a blood seal to seal off the temple. With the seal, the doors of the temple could only be opened by another Dragonborn.\nMembers.\n While most of the Blades died during the Great War, a few managed to escape the Thalmor. While it is unknown exactly how many Blades remain, there are three known Blades who made it into Skyrim.\nDelphine.\nDelphine took the role of &lt;a href=\"Blades%23Ranks\"&gt;Grandmaster&lt;/a&gt; of the Blades, as she was one of the last remaining members operating in Skyrim. She is a high-priority target for the Thalmor. During the Great War, she evaded several assassination attempts on her life. She returned to Skyrim to hide in &lt;a href=\"Riverwood%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Riverwood&lt;/a&gt;, remaining alert to the surveillance of the Thalmor.\nEsbern.\nEsbern is a Blade &lt;a href=\"Blades%23Ranks\"&gt;Archivist&lt;/a&gt;. He has been monitoring the ancient prophecies of Tamriel and had predicted the return of the dragons under Alduin, the &lt;a href=\"Nord\"&gt;Nord&lt;/a&gt;ic God of Destruction, whose return would lead to the destruction of &lt;a href=\"Nirn\"&gt;Nirn&lt;/a&gt;. As an Archivist, he knows a great deal about the nature of the dragon threat in Skyrim.\nAcilius Bolar.\nAcilius was a &lt;a href=\"Blades%23Ranks\"&gt;Knight Brother&lt;/a&gt; and the only known survivor of the siege of &lt;a href=\"Cloud%20Ruler%20Temple\"&gt;Cloud Ruler Temple&lt;/a&gt;. After his escape, he left for Skyrim, hoping to hide from the Thalmor, but was cornered in &lt;a href=\"Bloated%20Man%27s%20Grotto\"&gt;Bloated Man's Grotto&lt;/a&gt; where he was killed. His &lt;a href=\"Bolar%27s%20Oathblade\"&gt;Oathblade&lt;/a&gt; can be found there, next to his &lt;a href=\"Bolar%27s%20Writ\"&gt;writ&lt;/a&gt;.\nQuests.\nRadiant quests.\nRadiant quests are reoccurring and can be completed unlimited times.\nInteractions.\nAs the loyal servants of Dragonborns throughout the ages, Blades play a vital role in the main quest line of .\nFirst contact.\nThe first contact with the Blades is made when the Dragonborn tries to recover the &lt;a href=\"Horn%20of%20Jurgen%20Windcaller\"&gt;Horn of Jurgen Windcaller&lt;/a&gt;. Instead of the horn, there is a &lt;a href=\"Mysterious%20Note%20%28Delphine%29\"&gt;note&lt;/a&gt;, asking the finder to rent the attic room in the &lt;a href=\"Sleeping%20Giant%20Inn\"&gt;Sleeping Giant Inn&lt;/a&gt;. Once it is done, they are met by Delphine, who had previously taken the horn to lure the Dragonborn here. This was done so she could see whether or not the rumor of a new Dragonborn was a trap laid by the Thalmor.\nDragonslaying.\nAfter Delphine met the Dragonborn, she remained unconvinced of his abilities and revealed that she had seen the &lt;a href=\"Dragonstone\"&gt;Dragonstone&lt;/a&gt;, recovered earlier by the Dragonborn. Translated by &lt;a href=\"Farengar%20Secret-Fire\"&gt;Farengar&lt;/a&gt;, the stone had given Delphine a location of a &lt;a href=\"Dragon%20Burial%20Mounds\"&gt;dragon burial site&lt;/a&gt;, where another dragon could have been resurrected. To test the Dragonborn's abilities, she decided to investigate the site near &lt;a href=\"Kynesgrove%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Kynesgrove&lt;/a&gt;, inviting the Dragonborn to come with her.\nAfter the site has been reached and the dragon was slain, Delphine witnessed the Dragonborn's ability to consume &lt;a href=\"Dragon%20Soul\"&gt;dragon souls&lt;/a&gt;. After being convinced that this was a true Dragonborn, she returned to the Sleeping Giant Inn, where she revealed that she is one of the last surviving Blades.\nSaving the Archivist.\nNot knowing the cause of the Dragon Crisis, Delphine sent the Dragonborn to infiltrate the &lt;a href=\"Thalmor%20Embassy%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Thalmor Embassy&lt;/a&gt;. With the help of a servant, the &lt;a href=\"Bosmer%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Wood Elf&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Malborn\"&gt;Malborn&lt;/a&gt;, the mission succeeded. The Embassy, however, held no information on who is to blame for the dragons' return. Fortunately, a document was recovered that states that an old Blades Archivist, Esbern, is alive and hiding in &lt;a href=\"the%20Ratway\"&gt;the Ratway&lt;/a&gt;, the underground sewers beneath the town of &lt;a href=\"Riften%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Riften&lt;/a&gt;.\nSurprised that the old man was still alive, Delphine sent the Dragonborn to rescue him. Slaying a Thalmor search party, the Dragonborn saved Esbern just in time and convinced him to meet with Delphine back at the Inn.\nNew home.\nAfter Esbern met Delphine, he was told of an ancient Akaviri temple located in Skyrim. The temple is said to contain &lt;a href=\"Alduin%27s%20Wall\"&gt;Alduin's Wall&lt;/a&gt;, depicting an ancient prophecy of Alduin's return. After this story, both Blades and the Dragonborn began a journey to the temple. Facing a resistance of &lt;a href=\"Forsworn\"&gt;Forsworn&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Karthspire\"&gt;Karthspire&lt;/a&gt;, the group fought their way through and finally reached the door to the Sky Haven Temple.\nThe temple, however, is sealed. Esbern guessed that only a Dragonborn's blood could open the door, and this proves to be accurate, as the Dragonborn's blood released the lock. After the door to the temple was opened, Delphine and Esbern allowed the Dragonborn to have the honor of entering it first. After a quick examination of the wall, Esbern revealed that &lt;a href=\"Dragonsreach\"&gt;Dragonsreach&lt;/a&gt; was originally designed to capture and house a dragon.\nEsbern decided to remain and study the wall thoroughly while Delphine took on the role of acting Grandmaster, expressing her wish to restore the order and repair the temple.\nPeace.\nIf the &lt;a href=\"Skyrim%20Civil%20War\"&gt;Civil War&lt;/a&gt; questline is not completed, the Blades will join (much to the dismay of &lt;a href=\"the%20Greybeards\"&gt;the Greybeards&lt;/a&gt;) the negotiation of a peace treaty between the &lt;a href=\"Stormcloaks\"&gt;Stormcloaks&lt;/a&gt; and the Empire. Fed up with the arguing, Esbern will give a speech about how both sides are putting their lesser conflicts before the great danger of &lt;a href=\"Alduin%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Alduin&lt;/a&gt;. This calmed the participants and rendered the signing of the truce possible.\nAfter the peace treaty is signed, the Blades will ask that the dragon &lt;a href=\"Paarthurnax%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Paarthurnax&lt;/a&gt; be &lt;a href=\"Paarthurnax%20%28Quest%29\"&gt;killed&lt;/a&gt;. Fulfilling this request is optional, but the Blades will cease any co-operation with the Dragonborn until Paarthurnax is dead. Completing the main quest line without killing Paarthurnax will cause this side quest to disappear from the menu. If the quest &lt;a href=\"Sovngarde%20%28Quest%29\"&gt;Sovngarde&lt;/a&gt; has been completed, Paarthurnax will be flagged as &lt;a href=\"Essential%20Characters%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;essential&lt;/a&gt; and cannot be killed. However, returning after the &lt;a href=\"Epilogue%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;epilogue scene&lt;/a&gt; will cause Paarthurnax to become non-essential, thus allowing the Dragonborn to get the special ending \"and\" be a member of the Blades.\nRecruits.\nAfter Delphine has settled in at the temple and the Dragonborn has become a member of the Blades, she will ask for help with restoring the Blades. A maximum of three &lt;a href=\"Followers%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;followers&lt;/a&gt; may be brought to Delphine to have them inducted into the Blades. The recruits will receive a complete set of &lt;a href=\"Blades%20Armor%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Blades armor&lt;/a&gt; and a &lt;a href=\"Blades%20Sword%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Blades sword&lt;/a&gt;. When they have joined the order, they will move into the temple and make it their place of residence.\nAfter three followers have been inducted into the order, Delphine will send the Dragonborn to Esbern, who will provide the locations of dragons to hunt.\nOath.\nDelphine: \"You there. The Dragonborn wishes to give you the chance to join the lost guardians of Tamriel. The dragon slayers. The Blades. Do you wish to become a Blade?\"\nFollower: \"I do.\"\nDelphine: \"Are you willing to trade away all claims and titles of your former life? To live here and devote yourself to protecting Tamriel from danger?\"\nFollower: \"I do.\"\nDelphine: \"Then by my right as acting grandmaster, I name you a Blade, with all the privileges, rights, and burdens that brings. Godspeed.\"\nArchivist's services.\nEsbern will offer an option to hunt dragons. The new Blades recruits will always help with this quest and spawn near the dragon's location.\nAfter completing the first dragon hunt, Esbern will exchange &lt;a href=\"Esbern%27s%20Potion\"&gt;Esbern's Potion&lt;/a&gt; for one set of &lt;a href=\"Dragon%20Bone%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;dragon bones&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Dragon%20Scales%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;dragon scales&lt;/a&gt;.

The outer temple of Bleak Falls is separated from the rest of Skyrim by rigid hills and harsh blizzards, there are a couple of roads leading into the ruins, between the &lt;a href=\"Whiterun\"&gt;Whiterun&lt;/a&gt; plains and the &lt;a href=\"White%20River\"&gt;White River&lt;/a&gt;. The courtyard is large, with several defensive precipices overlooking the area. The deeper the ruins go, the more natural caverns begin to appear, the final room housing the &lt;a href=\"Word%20Wall\"&gt;Word Wall&lt;/a&gt; is an open cavern with a skylight coming at the top. Rivers from &lt;a href=\"Lake%20Ilinalta\"&gt;Lake Ilinalta&lt;/a&gt; flow their way into Bleak Falls Sanctum. Creatures such as the &lt;a href=\"Frost%20Troll\"&gt;Frost Troll&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Bats\"&gt;Bats&lt;/a&gt; inhabit the Sanctum while most of the ruins have the usual &lt;a href=\"Draugr\"&gt;Draugr&lt;/a&gt; living in the temple.\nHistory.\n&lt;a href=\"Fourth%20Era\"&gt;Fourth Era&lt;/a&gt;.\nDuring the &lt;a href=\"Skyrim%20Civil%20War\"&gt;Skyrim Civil War&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"4E%20201\"&gt;4E 201&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"court%20wizard\"&gt;court wizard&lt;/a&gt; of Whiterun at the time, &lt;a href=\"Farengar%20Secret-Fire\"&gt;Farengar Secret-Fire&lt;/a&gt; had recently discovered the Dragonstone inside the ruins of Bleak Falls Barrow. He had discussed his findings with his &lt;a href=\"Delphine\"&gt;contact&lt;/a&gt; from &lt;a href=\"Riverwood\"&gt;Riverwood&lt;/a&gt;. Around this time, the township of &lt;a href=\"Helgen\"&gt;Helgen&lt;/a&gt; was sacked by the World-Eater Dragon named &lt;a href=\"Alduin\"&gt;Alduin&lt;/a&gt;. Afterward, a &lt;a href=\"Last%20Dragonborn\"&gt;survivor&lt;/a&gt; of the destruction had escaped to Whiterun, to inform &lt;a href=\"Jarl%20Balgruuf%20the%20Greater\"&gt;Jarl Balgruuf the Greater&lt;/a&gt; about the Dragon attacks. Because the survivor had experience with Dragons, Balgruuf showed the warrior to Farengar, who then tasked the traveler with retrieving the Dragonstone tablet from Bleak Falls. Sometime later, the warrior had acquired the tablet and given it to Farengar, who was meeting with his contact. The contact would then take the Dragonstone and create a map detailing the different &lt;a href=\"Dragon%20Mound\"&gt;Dragon Mound&lt;/a&gt;s found throughout Skyrim."}

He will then instruct the Dragonborn to look for this Dragonstone map in Bleak Falls Barrow, starting the quest of the same name.\nBleak Falls Barrow.\nTravel to the Ancient Nordic ruins of Bleak Falls Barrow. Outside are several bandits and after eliminating them, the Dragonborn can then find the entrance at the top of the stairs, leading into the Bleak Falls Temple. In the first large room a couple of bandits have set up camp and are discussing things regarding a Dunmer who went further into the ruins when entering. When moving forward they will detect and attack on sight. Continue into the corridor and proceed until reaching a small room with a bandit, a lever and a puzzle. Watch him pull the lever setting off a trap that will kill him with poisoned darts. Set the pillars on the left of the entrance after the tablets on the upper wall above the gate and the tablet beside the lever. The order, from left to right is: snake, snake, whale.\nArvel the Swift.\nTravel further through the dungeon to winding stairs that go downwards. There are &lt;a href=\"Skeever%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;skeevers&lt;/a&gt; at the bottom, and just around the corner waits a wounded frostbite spider. Kill it and then speak to &lt;a href=\"Arvel%20the%20Swift\"&gt;Arvel the Swift&lt;/a&gt;, who is trapped in a spider web. He wants to be freed, which can be done by hitting the spider web with a weapon. As soon as he's free, Arvel will make a run for it. Chase him down the corridor and kill him, or let the &lt;a href=\"Draugr%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;draugr&lt;/a&gt; do it further in. When he is released from the web, he recoils and has low health, and it is quite easy to kill him before he can escape. If he manages to slay the draugr, he may run over the pressure plate trap near the scene of the battle and get himself impaled on the swinging wall trap. However, if this happens, his body may be flung a large way away and it may be difficult to find. His body may also end up behind the swinging wall trap. Even if he gets past the trap and first three draugr, he'll meet his end against the Restless Draugr beyond the trap, as that draugr uses a one-handed Ancient Nord Weapon and ice magic.\nThe Golden Claw.\nArvel will have the &lt;a href=\"Golden%20Claw\"&gt;Golden Claw&lt;/a&gt; with him. Continue through a hall where some draugr wake up and attack. There are pressure plate traps near the entry and stepping on it will trigger a swinging wall trap. The next obstacle will be a swinging blade trap. The blades can be stopped with a chain pull after passing them. The next room has four more draugr. Kill or avoid them and follow the path upstairs. At the room with a creek running through it go through the metal gate into the creek. The gate is opened by pulling the chain on the right side. There is another draugr that steps out of a sarcophagus as the Dragonborn enters the room. Go down the path, fight the draugr on the ledge and continue into bleak falls sanctum.\nNext there is a Nordic puzzle door with three movable rings. The Golden Claw is the key here, both literally and figuratively. Align the three rings in a specific pattern, which can be seen when zooming in on the Claw in the inventory. The correct combination is on the palm of the Golden Claw (from top to bottom: bear, moth, owl). When the rings have been correctly aligned, use the Claw in the middle of the door to unlock and open it.\nWord Wall.\nPast the door lies the real treasure of the crypt: A Word Wall that teaches a word of the Dragon Shout &lt;a href=\"Unrelenting%20Force%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Unrelenting Force&lt;/a&gt;. Afterwards, a powerful draugr boss will emerge from the sarcophagus nearby. Kill it and get the Dragonstone off its corpse and leave the crypt through the exit nearby. This will likely be the first time the Dragonborn faces a draugr boss enemy, possibly a Draugr Overlord or higher based on the Dragonborn's level at the time. The draugr will use Unrelenting Force to stagger the Dragonborn and uses a frost-enchanted Ancient Nord Weapon. A clear indication of when it uses its Thu'um will be when it stands straight up, before leaning forward to open its mouth and release the Shout.\nIf the Dragonborn finds themselves overpowered by the draugr, to the right from the entry to the cavern on the far side of the bridge is an easily accessible area which the draugr cannot reach which allows the Dragonborn to snipe with arrows or magic.\nReturn to Dragonsreach and give the Dragonstone to Farengar (with a stop off at Riverwood to return the Golden Claw to Lucan). &lt;a href=\"Irileth\"&gt;Irileth&lt;/a&gt; will run in almost immediately and ask Farengar to come quickly to speak to the Jarl, beginning the quest \"&lt;a href=\"Dragon%20Rising\"&gt;Dragon Rising&lt;/a&gt;.\""}

There is an inn, the &lt;a href=\"Bleaker%27s%20Way%20Goodwill%20Inn\"&gt;Bleaker's Way Goodwill Inn&lt;/a&gt;, run by &lt;a href=\"Kirsten\"&gt;Kirsten&lt;/a&gt;, a member of the Ulfgar family."}

There was only one by the shore, but he thought he saw others farther out in deeper water.\nIf Otroggar wasn't as drunk as a moon-struck &lt;a href=\"Khajiit%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Khajiit&lt;/a&gt;, I'd say it sounds like a meat-eater.

The small garrison stationed in this frozen, remote &lt;a href=\"Ebonheart%20Pact\"&gt;Ebonheart Pact&lt;/a&gt; outpost keeps watch on the sea for invading ships.\nBackground.\nBleakrock Isle has been inhabited by local &lt;a href=\"Nords%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Nords&lt;/a&gt; since the &lt;a href=\"Merethic%20Era\"&gt;Merethic Era&lt;/a&gt;. During the time of the &lt;a href=\"Dragon%20Cult\"&gt;Dragon Cult&lt;/a&gt; the island was ruled by the &lt;a href=\"Dragon%20Priest\"&gt;Dragon Priest&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Haldriin\"&gt;Haldriin&lt;/a&gt; from the temple of &lt;a href=\"Skyshroud%20Barrow\"&gt;Skyshroud Barrow&lt;/a&gt;. The mine of &lt;a href=\"Hozzin%27s%20Folly%20%28Location%29\"&gt;Hozzin's Folly&lt;/a&gt; was established by a prospector and his family to mine for iron, but were in fact &lt;a href=\"Daedra%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Daedra&lt;/a&gt; worshippers seeking to establish a cult inside the ancient Nordic burial chambers.\nIn &lt;a href=\"2E%20582\"&gt;2E 582&lt;/a&gt;, during the &lt;a href=\"Alliance%20War\"&gt;Alliance War&lt;/a&gt;, Bleakrock Isle was invaded by the &lt;a href=\"Daggerfall%20Covenant\"&gt;Daggerfall Covenant&lt;/a&gt; as a prelude to the invasion of &lt;a href=\"Stonefalls%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Stonefalls&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Bal%20Foyen\"&gt;Bal Foyen&lt;/a&gt; to eliminate the islands early warning capability. The Covenant forces, commanded by &lt;a href=\"General%20Serien\"&gt;General Serien&lt;/a&gt;, scouted the island and sought to use the power of the Daedric cult at Hozzin's Folly as well as raise the dead at Skyshroud Barrow to support the invasion of the Pact's territory. Soldiers of the Covenant burned the central town of &lt;a href=\"Bleakrock%20Village\"&gt;Bleakrock Village&lt;/a&gt;, displacing much of the islands population who fled to Bal Foyen. The &lt;a href=\"Vestige\"&gt;Vestige&lt;/a&gt; was on the island during the invasion and worked with &lt;a href=\"Captain%20Rana\"&gt;Captain Rana&lt;/a&gt; to evacuate the residents and fend off the Covenant. During this time, bandit activity greatly increased on the island, making it necessary for residents to carry &lt;a href=\"Alabaster%20Bandit%20Whistle\"&gt;Alabaster Bandit Whistle&lt;/a&gt;s to sound when they required aid.\nLocations.\nThe following are locations accessible in Bleakrock Isle and, with the exception of &lt;a href=\"Unmarked%20Locations%20%28Online%29\"&gt;unmarked locations&lt;/a&gt;, are discoverable on the map. Points of Interest serve as locations with unique side quests, while &lt;a href=\"Cities%20%28Online%29\"&gt;cities&lt;/a&gt; serve as the centralised areas with multiple sublocations and act as a hub for services and &lt;a href=\"Merchants%20%28Online%29\"&gt;merchants&lt;/a&gt;. Explanations of the types of locations are provided in the &lt;a href=\"Locations%20%28Online%29%23Types\"&gt;main locations page&lt;/a&gt;.\nQuests.\nBleakrock Isle features a series of zone story quests and unrelated side quests. The zone story quests begin the Ebonheart Pact's overarching storyline before continuing to &lt;a href=\"Bal%20Foyen\"&gt;Bal Foyen&lt;/a&gt;. It is not necessary to complete the story quests for zones prior to those in Bleakrock Isle. Side quests are non-sequential and can be completed in any order, except where one carries on from another. &lt;a href=\"Repeatable%20quests\"&gt;Repeatable quests&lt;/a&gt; can be completed multiple times: weekly for arenas and trials and daily for all others.\nItem Sets.\nItem sets are related armor and weapons that, when worn together, provide unique benefits. Overland sets can be acquired from world bosses, world events, delves, public dungeons and containers and as quest rewards; dungeon sets can be acquired from within group dungeons; monster sets can be acquired from the final boss of veteran group dungeons and Undaunted Enclaves; and crafted sets can be created at specific locations across the zone.\nSkyshards.\nThree Skyshards can be found in Bleakrock Isle totaling in one &lt;a href=\"skill%20point\"&gt;skill point&lt;/a&gt;. The zone guide provides clues as to the location of each Skyshard, but many can be found simply by exploring and watching for the distinctive pillar of light they emit. Skyshards will appear on the map and compass when the Vestige is close to one and will remain discovered on the map even if it was not collected.\nAchievements.\nAchievements can be earned by completing specific tasks such as completing quests and discovering locations. Achievements are separated into categories and their progress is viewable from the journal. Earning achievement provides the Vestige a number of points, and some achievements unlock unique rewards such as &lt;a href=\"Furnishings%20%28Online%29\"&gt;furnishings&lt;/a&gt; that can be bought from Achievement Furnishers or &lt;a href=\"collectibles\"&gt;collectibles&lt;/a&gt;.\nFish.\nFish can be caught from fishing hotspots, ideally with the correct &lt;a href=\"bait\"&gt;bait&lt;/a&gt;. Common fish will be caught most often while rare fish and alternative bait are rare catches. Each zone has unique rare fish than can be caught from hotspots. &lt;a href=\"Slaughterfish%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Slaughterfish&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"trodh\"&gt;trodh&lt;/a&gt; can be caught from foul hotspots, &lt;a href=\"dhufish\"&gt;dhufish&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"longfin\"&gt;longfin&lt;/a&gt; can be caught from saltwater hotspots, &lt;a href=\"silverside%20perch\"&gt;silverside perch&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"spadetail\"&gt;spadetail&lt;/a&gt; can be caught from lake hotspots, and &lt;a href=\"Salmon%20%28Online%29\"&gt;salmon&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"River%20Betty%20%28Online%29\"&gt;river betty&lt;/a&gt; can be caught from river hotspots. &lt;a href=\"Chub\"&gt;Chub&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"minnow\"&gt;minnow&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"shad\"&gt;shad&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"fish%20roe\"&gt;fish roe&lt;/a&gt; can be caught and used as bait from foul, saltwater, lake and river hotspots, respectively."}

The perk description does not state anything about said weapon's &lt;a href=\"Damage%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;damage&lt;/a&gt; amount or duration. Bleeding damage and its duration are only affected by the respective perk level and the &lt;a href=\"Weapons%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;weapon&lt;/a&gt; material of the &lt;a href=\"Last%20Dragonborn\"&gt;Dragonborn&lt;/a&gt;.\nBleeding effect table.\nRank 1\u20133 damage and duration is applicable for both perks, Hack and Slash as well as Limbsplitter. Duration is in seconds. Note that not all weapon materials are listed here (e.g. &lt;a href=\"Ancient%20Nord%20Weapons\"&gt;Ancient Nord&lt;/a&gt;), but that is due to other materials using standard templates. Dragonbone weapons get no bleed effect.\nNote: All those values have been taken from the &lt;a href=\"Creation%20Kit\"&gt;Creation Kit&lt;/a&gt; and are accurate.\nWeapon choice.\nWar Axes are a better choice of weapon for making maximum use of bleed damage as compared to Battleaxes. Battleaxe attacks are much slower than War Axe attacks and thus less bleed damage effects per second are inflicted on the target. Furthermore, War Axes can be dual wielded to inflict maximum possible bleed damage. It is also possible to dual wield a War Axe with a dagger.\u00a0While dual wielding with a dagger deals less damage and less bleeding damage from this perk is inflicted, the dagger has a faster attack speed which will stagger the opponent more often, which is important for dual wielding.\nApplications.\nBleed damage does not really shine on harder difficulties, but on easier ones, it is a viable tactic to hit the enemy to apply a bleed effect and then block his blows. Before hitting again, bashing staggers the opponent, allowing one to strike him without fear of retaliation. This tactic however needs proper blocking skills.\nOn harder difficulties it is still an option to increase the damage output for dual War Axe wielders. While the damage inflicted is minimal and less than those of enchantments, it's still always there."}

During this time, the &lt;a href=\"Reman%20Empire\"&gt;Reman Empire&lt;/a&gt; was waging a war on &lt;a href=\"Black%20Marsh\"&gt;Black Marsh&lt;/a&gt; that was turning out to be a costly campaign. It was the General in charge of the war whose actions started the fire.\nBackround.\nDuring the &lt;a href=\"Blackwater%20War\"&gt;Blackwater War&lt;/a&gt; of the &lt;a href=\"First%20Era\"&gt;First Era&lt;/a&gt;, the Reman Empire continued to suffer greatly in this war that had already lasted for about 17 years. The war was already in its second campaign after General &lt;a href=\"Augurius%20Bucco\"&gt;Augurius Bucco&lt;/a&gt; was replaced by General &lt;a href=\"Regulus%20Sardecus\"&gt;Regulus Sardecus&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Imperial%20Legion\"&gt;Imperial Legion&lt;/a&gt; was suffering heavy casualties. A new strategy was needed, otherwise the war would be lost.\nGeneral Sardecus decided that the Argonians were not the true enemy, it was the swamps and disease of Black Marsh. Sardecus' plan was to destroy all the land. They drained the swamps, salted rice paddies, and cut down hundred, possibly thousands of trees. During the month of &lt;a href=\"Rain%27s%20Hand\"&gt;Rain's Hand&lt;/a&gt; one of Sardecus' most trusted legates, Elisia Mallicius, told some of her sappers to burn a peat bog outside of the city of &lt;a href=\"Stormhold\"&gt;Stormhold&lt;/a&gt;. Little did they know that this bog was part of a massive underground network that led out as far as &lt;a href=\"Gideon\"&gt;Gideon&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Soulrest\"&gt;Soulrest&lt;/a&gt;. The entire region was set ablaze, and for months the Legion didn't even know about it. This fire would last for over 3 years, and it would come to be known as the \"Great Burn.\" The inferno of burning peat detritus made the area inhospitable, even for Argonians. The Legion had to give up ground for the first time in years.\nAftermath.\nThe Great Burn may have been one of the most influential moments in the history of Black Marsh. Dozens of Argonian tribes were wiped out, and countless amounts of flora and fauna that were unique to Black Marsh were made extinct by the event. The entire area was nearly uninhabitable for decades to come.\nNot only did the native Argonians suffer, but the Legion suffered nearly just as much. Hundreds of soldiers were lost to a disease known as \"swamp lung,\" and hundreds others were killed by gas explosions before they could retreat out of the area. General Sardecus also fell ill and died before he made it back to the &lt;a href=\"Imperial%20City\"&gt;Imperial City&lt;/a&gt;."}

The chapel altars are desecrated and four dead priests are strewn across the floor. The pews are knocked over and runes are found around the altar much like in the &lt;a href=\"Chapel%20of%20Dibella\"&gt;Chapel of Dibella&lt;/a&gt;.\nAreas.\nThe Great Chapel of Mara.\nAll the doors from the outside lead to this room.

The chapel is divided into three areas as are all chapels: The Great Chapel of Talos, The Chapel Hall, and the Chapel Undercroft. There are a few minor changes with the installation of the expansion pack.\nAreas.\nThe Great Chapel of Talos.\nThe three front doors of the chapel lead into an entrance two steps higher than the main room ahead. A staircase in the middle of the entrance leads down to a small hallway with three doors. The two by the west wall reveal the Undercroft and the one on the east wall leads into the Chapel Hall. The cathedral altar is at the end of the room, and nine altars - one to each of the &lt;a href=\"Nine%20Divines\"&gt;Nine Divines&lt;/a&gt; - line the room.\nThe Chapel Hall.\nIn the main room of the Chapel Hall are two food barrels in the southeast corner, two more in the northwest corner, and another in the northeast corner next to two food sacks. A copy of \"&lt;a href=\"2920%2C%20Hearth%20Fire\"&gt;2920, Hearth Fire&lt;/a&gt;\" sits on the bookshelf in the northwest corner, and the two wine racks in the northeast corner hold a total of 20 bottles of &lt;a href=\"cheap%20wine\"&gt;cheap wine&lt;/a&gt;.

There are four tombs along each side of this room, with a ninth opposite the doors. From the entrance, the third tomb on the right has a ledge that holds a jewelry chest and a sample of &lt;a href=\"sacred%20lotus%20seeds\"&gt;sacred lotus seeds&lt;/a&gt;. The doorway on the west wall leads down to a small room with three tombs, two altars, and a drain in the middle of the floor.\nKnights of the Nine.\nThe changes that occur with the plug-in are very few and most of the changes involve which books are where. The middle of the Chapel Hall now has \"&lt;a href=\"The%20Adabal-a\"&gt;The Adabal-a&lt;/a&gt;\" and the book on the table near it is now \"&lt;a href=\"Shezarr%20and%20the%20Divines\"&gt;Shezarr and the Divines&lt;/a&gt;\".

The Forest is endless and wonderful, travelers can find mystical creatures like a &lt;a href=\"Unicorn\"&gt;Unicorn&lt;/a&gt; and ruins of the past like &lt;a href=\"Sardavar%20Leed\"&gt;Sardavar Leed&lt;/a&gt; deep within the evergreens of the &lt;a href=\"Colovia\"&gt;Colovia&lt;/a&gt;n Frontier.\nDescription.\nGeography.\n&lt;a href=\"Northern%20Great%20Forest\"&gt;Northern Great Forest&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe northern hold of Great Forest is closest to the &lt;a href=\"Jerall%20Mountains\"&gt;Jerall Mountains&lt;/a&gt; in the frozen north and is moderately forested, compared to the rest of the region. The &lt;a href=\"Glademist\"&gt;Glademist&lt;/a&gt; forest resembles the autumnal forest of &lt;a href=\"the%20Rift\"&gt;the Rift&lt;/a&gt;, located in &lt;a href=\"Skyrim\"&gt;Skyrim&lt;/a&gt;. It is not as vast as the Rift, but it is very distinctive. The town of &lt;a href=\"Bleaker%27s%20Way\"&gt;Bleaker's Way&lt;/a&gt; is situated on the road in between the &lt;a href=\"Heartlands\"&gt;Heartlands&lt;/a&gt; and the Jerall Mountains. The area provides a clear distinction between the snowy hills and the autumn forest. The &lt;a href=\"Orange%20Road\"&gt;Orange Road&lt;/a&gt; goes through the region and is the only major trading road that is not connected to the &lt;a href=\"Red%20Ring%20Road\"&gt;Red Ring Road&lt;/a&gt;. The &lt;a href=\"Black%20Road\"&gt;Black Road&lt;/a&gt; goes through the southern edge and leads to &lt;a href=\"Chorrol\"&gt;Chorrol&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Dragon%27s%20Teeth%20Mountains\"&gt;Dragon's Teeth Mountains&lt;/a&gt;.\n&lt;a href=\"Central%20Great%20Forest\"&gt;Central Great Forest&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe Central Great Forest is the deepest part of the forest and is home to several notable Ayleid cities including &lt;a href=\"Narfinsel\"&gt;Narfinsel&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Ceyatatar\"&gt;Ceyatatar&lt;/a&gt;, both of which have benefitted from their location. Several natural caverns go deep into the earth such as &lt;a href=\"Serpent%20Hollow%20Cave\"&gt;Serpent Hollow Cave&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Fort%20Wooden%20Hand\"&gt;Fort Wooden Hand&lt;/a&gt;. The &lt;a href=\"Gold%20Road\"&gt;Gold Road&lt;/a&gt; runs through the southern portion of the forest, which leads into the city of &lt;a href=\"Skingrad\"&gt;Skingrad&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Gold%20Coast\"&gt;Gold Coast&lt;/a&gt;. The western side starts to open into the &lt;a href=\"Imperial%20Reserve\"&gt;Imperial Reserve&lt;/a&gt;, and more settlements begin to spring up around this area including &lt;a href=\"Brindle\"&gt;Brindle&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Hackdirt\"&gt;Hackdirt&lt;/a&gt;. This area of the Great Forest has had several disputes throughout the years.\n&lt;a href=\"Southern%20Great%20Forest\"&gt;Southern Great Forest&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe Southern Great Forest is the southern edge of the forest, and extends to the &lt;a href=\"Niben%20River\"&gt;Niben Estuary&lt;/a&gt; from &lt;a href=\"Lake%20Rumare\"&gt;Lake Rumare&lt;/a&gt;. This region can be considered a part of the &lt;a href=\"Nibenay\"&gt;Nibenay&lt;/a&gt;, the eastern portion of &lt;a href=\"Cyrodiil\"&gt;Cyrodiil&lt;/a&gt; which is more green dense and exotic-esque, resembling the original geography in the Imperial Province. The &lt;a href=\"White%20Rose%20River\"&gt;White Rose River&lt;/a&gt; is a rather small river that juts into the southern shore of Lake Rumare and goes deep into the Great Forest and the Roebeck Woodlands. The &lt;a href=\"Green%20Road\"&gt;Green Road&lt;/a&gt; runs through the region and is relatively close to the Niben River, the city of &lt;a href=\"Bravil\"&gt;Bravil&lt;/a&gt; is not far from the Great Forest border. The ruins of &lt;a href=\"Sardavar%20Leed\"&gt;Sardavar Leed&lt;/a&gt; is on the edge of the area, on a hill overlooking the &lt;a href=\"Imperial%20City\"&gt;Imperial City&lt;/a&gt; and the Niben River.\nFauna.\nUnicorn.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Unicorn\"&gt;Unicorn&lt;/a&gt; is one of the most hidden animals to be found in the Great Forest with many saying that it was an experience meeting one in person. The Unicorn resembles a white horse, with a beautiful aura and a large horn jutting out of the Unicorn's head. The Horn of a Unicorn is sought out by worshippers of &lt;a href=\"Hircine\"&gt;Hircine&lt;/a&gt;, who gives it to his shrine as an offering, to gain his audience. There have been records of a Unicorn living in &lt;a href=\"Harcane%20Grove\"&gt;Harcane Grove&lt;/a&gt; guarded by giant hulking &lt;a href=\"Minotaur\"&gt;Minotaur&lt;/a&gt;s. The Horn has magical properties that can break wards and other magical defenses. An example would be when &lt;a href=\"Medora%20Direnni\"&gt;Medora Direnni&lt;/a&gt; was sealed with &lt;a href=\"Direnni%20Tower\"&gt;Direnni Tower&lt;/a&gt; on the &lt;a href=\"Isle%20of%20Balfiera\"&gt;Isle of Balfiera&lt;/a&gt;, the powers of a Unicorn horn can break through the ward, which was instituted by &lt;a href=\"Queen%20Mynisera\"&gt;Queen Mynisera&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"Daggerfall\"&gt;Daggerfall&lt;/a&gt;. Unicorns have amazing golden eyes and run fast like the wind making them very elusive. There is no record of any other sightings of Unicorns outside of the Great Forest since there is more Hircine worship in Northern &lt;a href=\"Bangkorai\"&gt;Bangkorai&lt;/a&gt;. It is possible they are somewhere within the &lt;a href=\"Viridian%20Woods\"&gt;Viridian Woods&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Mournoth\"&gt;Mournoth&lt;/a&gt;.\nTimber Wolf.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Timber%20Wolf\"&gt;Timber Wolf&lt;/a&gt; is the variety of wolf that lives around the Heartlands and the Great Forest. They resemble an ordinary wolf with lightly-gray fur and are a commodity within the Heartlands of Cyrodiil. Wolves, in general, travel in packs and attack unsuspecting prey. Wolves are one of the most common creatures in the Great Forest which are to be expected, found in most of the natural caves throughout the region. The &lt;a href=\"Vampire\"&gt;Vampire&lt;/a&gt;s and Bandits have used tamed wolves as bodyguards. Wolves have a natural resistance to frost but carry small aspects of &lt;a href=\"Helljoint\"&gt;Helljoint&lt;/a&gt;, a disease that causes those who contract it, to become very slow and encumbered. Since the Great Forest is mainly a part of Colovia, the region has various sightings of a &lt;a href=\"Dire%20Wolf\"&gt;Dire Wolf&lt;/a&gt;, a hulking beast that is tamed by the denizens of Colovia, they are mainly found in the &lt;a href=\"Colovian%20Highlands\"&gt;Colovian Highlands&lt;/a&gt; but can be found throughout Western Cyrodiil.\nGoblin.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Goblin\"&gt;Goblin&lt;/a&gt;s of Cyrodiil is where the majority of the Goblin-ken population is located in Tamriel, ranging from the &lt;a href=\"Gremlins\"&gt;Gremlins&lt;/a&gt; to the &lt;a href=\"Ogre\"&gt;Ogre&lt;/a&gt;s. Goblins are divided into tribes and are a rather primitive race, way more primitive than the &lt;a href=\"Orsimer\"&gt;Orsimer&lt;/a&gt; could have ever been. Goblins have a unique style of equipment made out of &lt;a href=\"Argentum\"&gt;Argentum&lt;/a&gt; known as the &lt;a href=\"Racial%20Motifs\"&gt;Primal Style&lt;/a&gt; which can be seen as taking two pieces of material and creating a weapon. A petty Iron Maul resembles a large wooden plank with spiky bracers surrounding it. Same goes with a standard blade, a hilt with a wooden plank and a shoddy blade attached to the plank. Since Goblins are known to be scavengers throughout Tamriel, it is evident that their lifestyle reflects that. The leader of a Goblin is known as the Chieftain or a Warlord, having powerful armor and unique weapons. The Goblin Shaman comes equipped with a Silver Dagger, proficient when attacking &lt;a href=\"Will-o-the-Wisp\"&gt;Will-o-the-Wisp&lt;/a&gt; or other magical anomalies. Goblins can take a small settlement, maybe even a township, if they are well organized. There have been several records of people pretending or believe they are in fact, Goblins.\nImp.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Imp\"&gt;Imp&lt;/a&gt;s are creatures found throughout mild climates in Tamriel, in places such as the Great Forest, &lt;a href=\"Stormhaven\"&gt;Stormhaven&lt;/a&gt;, and even &lt;a href=\"Auridon\"&gt;Auridon&lt;/a&gt;. They utilize meek-levels of &lt;a href=\"Destruction\"&gt;Destruction&lt;/a&gt; magic such as &lt;a href=\"Flames\"&gt;Flames&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"Sparks\"&gt;Sparks&lt;/a&gt; to attack enemies. They somewhat resemble Goblins and &lt;a href=\"Homonculus\"&gt;Homonculus&lt;/a&gt;, more so the latter by having large thin wings and long nails that can cut through flesh. The Imps have a unique language known as &lt;a href=\"Impish\"&gt;Impish&lt;/a&gt;, which can be taught and used to tame these slightly intelligent creatures. They can be found sparsely throughout the forest and are usually found alone in the wilds, making them relatively easy to defeat. Imps have a desired alchemic ingredient called &lt;a href=\"Imp%20Gall\"&gt;Imp Gall&lt;/a&gt;, which is used as a poison to damage health and to lash out fire damage to those who come in contact. There is a &lt;a href=\"Robber%27s%20Glen%20Cave\"&gt;cave&lt;/a&gt; located near the city of &lt;a href=\"Bravil\"&gt;Bravil&lt;/a&gt;, on the edge of the Great Forest that houses quite some Imps. As mentioned before, Imps have levels of friendship, having the ability to deceive scared prey and outmaneuver them. Imps are truly persnickety creatures that one must take caution when fighting them.\nSkeletons.\nThe Great Forest and the Heartlands house many different Ayleid ruins, each with their own significance. As expected, there are various cases of &lt;a href=\"Skeleton\"&gt;Skeleton&lt;/a&gt;s and other undead creatures located within the rubble. Skeletons are the magical construct of a long dead creature, the Skeletons found in the Ayleid ruins are of those exact Ayleids that once lived there. These elves have an affinity for magic, as do all the other elvish races. They possess powerful equipment ranging from Cyrodiilic Iron to Ancient Elven Steel. Skeletons not only appear in Ayleid Ruins but ruins in general. &lt;a href=\"Fort%20Ash\"&gt;Fort Ash&lt;/a&gt;, for example, is riddled with Skeletons dating back to the &lt;a href=\"Interregnum\"&gt;Reman Interregnum&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Alliance%20War\"&gt;Alliance War&lt;/a&gt;. Skeletons have more often than not, have been created by &lt;a href=\"Necromancer\"&gt;Necromancer&lt;/a&gt;s who desire a place to study their dark arts. Since Necromancy has been abolished from the Guild of Mages by &lt;a href=\"Hannibal%20Traven%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;Hannibal Traven&lt;/a&gt;, he has hunted down Necromancers as far as the &lt;a href=\"Sea%20of%20Ghosts\"&gt;Sea of Ghosts&lt;/a&gt; on the Isle of &lt;a href=\"Olenveld\"&gt;Olenveld&lt;/a&gt;. The &lt;a href=\"Dark%20Brotherhood\"&gt;Dark Brotherhood&lt;/a&gt; utilize Skeletons as bodyguards for their sanctuaries. These creatures are known as the &lt;a href=\"Dark%20Guardian\"&gt;Dark Guardian&lt;/a&gt;, hulking skeletons carrying Brotherhood armor and heavy weapons. Skeletons can also be found in the depths of the &lt;a href=\"Imperial%20City%20Sewers\"&gt;Imperial City Sewers&lt;/a&gt;.\nFlora.\nThe Great Forest houses a wide variety of flora which is redundant to say because it is called the Great Forest for a reason. One such plant that is found commonly is the &lt;a href=\"Bergamot%20Seeds\"&gt;Bergamot Seeds&lt;/a&gt;, which is mainly found in the &lt;a href=\"Northern%20Great%20Forest\"&gt;Northern Great Forest&lt;/a&gt;, in an area between the Orange Road and the Black Road east of Chorrol. The Bergamot has alchemic properties that give the consumer resistance to disease and damage deriving from magic-based attacks. However, it can affect one's proficiency in magic and even prevent them from performing magic at all. Making it a rather risky ingredient for potions and other concoctions.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Fly%20Amanita%20Cap\"&gt;Fly Amanita Cap&lt;/a&gt; is a very common mushroom found throughout the forested regions of Tamriel, found in places such as &lt;a href=\"Falkreath%20Hold\"&gt;Falkreath Hold&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Glenumbra\"&gt;Glenumbra&lt;/a&gt;. This mushroom is found all throughout the County of Chorrol and the southeastern portion of the forest, near the &lt;a href=\"White%20Rose%20River\"&gt;White Rose River&lt;/a&gt;. The Fly Amanita can be made into an ailment where it can restore a consumer's health and their stamina, building up their agility. However, the mushroom can make a user feel cumbersome and encumbered. It also makes them susceptible to lightning magic. These mushrooms can also be found on the &lt;a href=\"Ruby%20Isles\"&gt;Ruby Isles&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Imperial%20City\"&gt;Imperial City&lt;/a&gt;, around the city walls and the southeastern peninsula.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Viper%27s%20Bugloss%20Leaves\"&gt;Viper's Bugloss Leaves&lt;/a&gt; are one of the most common types of flora found throughout the &lt;a href=\"Colovian%20West\"&gt;Colovian West&lt;/a&gt;, found mainly around the County of Chorrol but has pockets of them located in &lt;a href=\"County%20Skingrad\"&gt;County Skingrad&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Kvatch\"&gt;County of Kvatch&lt;/a&gt;. It is challenging not to notice a Viper's Bugloss in the wild; the leaves have very vibrant colors of blue and purple. Unlike the other alchemic plants, the Viper's Bugloss has more benefits rather than going hand in hand. The leaves have the potential to cure paralysis and even give resistance to the consumer. It also gives the user an ability known as Night Eye, a trait that a &lt;a href=\"Khajiit\"&gt;Khajiit&lt;/a&gt; knows naturally. It can also give the consumer burden and have them feeling encumbered.\nGovernment.\nA vast majority of the Great Forest exists in the region of &lt;a href=\"Colovia\"&gt;Colovia&lt;/a&gt;, as such, that portion of the area is under the control of the &lt;a href=\"Colovian%20Estates\"&gt;Colovian Estates&lt;/a&gt;. It is a government made of petty-kings and merchant barons from as far as the city of &lt;a href=\"Falkreath\"&gt;Falkreath&lt;/a&gt; and the city of &lt;a href=\"Anvil\"&gt;Anvil&lt;/a&gt;. The main settlement of the Great Forest is the town of &lt;a href=\"Chorrol\"&gt;Chorrol&lt;/a&gt;, which is a part of the Colovian Estates. Chorrol is the seat of power in &lt;a href=\"County%20Chorrol\"&gt;County Chorrol&lt;/a&gt;, the political nation of Chorrol that extends throughout the northwestern portion of the Great Forest. The leader of the County is known as the &lt;a href=\"Count\"&gt;Count&lt;/a&gt;, who operates out of &lt;a href=\"Castle%20Chorrol\"&gt;Castle Chorrol&lt;/a&gt;. Both &lt;a href=\"Skingrad\"&gt;Skingrad&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Bravil\"&gt;Bravil&lt;/a&gt; have portions of the Great Forest within their county.\nBefore the occupation of the Imperials, the Great Forest and the rest of Cyrodiil were under the control of the &lt;a href=\"Heartland%20Elves\"&gt;Heartland Elves&lt;/a&gt;, accurately known as the Ayleids. Some of the Ayleid ruins in the Great Forest were the center of a powerful kingdom of Ayleids and were used as slaving holds for the barbaric &lt;a href=\"Nedes\"&gt;Nedes&lt;/a&gt;. The city of &lt;a href=\"Ceyatatar\"&gt;Ceyatatar&lt;/a&gt; was once a trading capital and benefitted from the Ayleids of the White-Gold Tower, this factor lead to the establishment of several &lt;a href=\"Valenwood\"&gt;Valenwood&lt;/a&gt; cities including &lt;a href=\"Haven\"&gt;Haven&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Woodhearth\"&gt;Woodhearth&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Archen\"&gt;Archen&lt;/a&gt;. The city of Lindai had significance in the &lt;a href=\"Narfinsel%20Schism\"&gt;Narfinsel Schism&lt;/a&gt;, which originated from the city of &lt;a href=\"Narfinsel\"&gt;Narfinsel&lt;/a&gt;, also located in the Great Forest.\nReligion.\nEach city in the &lt;a href=\"Imperial%20Province\"&gt;Imperial Province&lt;/a&gt; has a chapel dedicated to one of the &lt;a href=\"Nine%20Divines\"&gt;Nine Divines&lt;/a&gt;. The city of &lt;a href=\"Chorrol\"&gt;Chorrol&lt;/a&gt;, located in the &lt;a href=\"Central%20Great%20Forest\"&gt;Central Great Forest&lt;/a&gt; has a chapel to &lt;a href=\"Stendarr\"&gt;Stendarr&lt;/a&gt;, the God of Mercy and Justice. The main religious order that worships Stendarr is known as the &lt;a href=\"Temple%20of%20Stendarr\"&gt;Temple of Stendarr&lt;/a&gt;, who has chapters located throughout the Empire. The &lt;a href=\"County%20of%20Bhoriane\"&gt;County of Bhoriane&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Alik%27r%20Desert\"&gt;Alik'r Desert&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;a href=\"Iliac%20Bay\"&gt;Iliac Bay&lt;/a&gt; have temples to Stendarr. Stendarr's teaching is primarily to help those in need whether they need protection or healing from opposing threats. These teachings are what inspired the Vigilants of Stendarr in &lt;a href=\"Skyrim\"&gt;Skyrim&lt;/a&gt; and the eventual rise of the &lt;a href=\"Dawnguard\"&gt;Dawnguard&lt;/a&gt;. The &lt;a href=\"Temple%20of%20Stendarr\"&gt;Temple of Stendarr&lt;/a&gt; are allied to the &lt;a href=\"Benevolence%20of%20Mara\"&gt;Benevolence of Mara&lt;/a&gt; but are enemies to the worshippers of &lt;a href=\"Ebonarm\"&gt;Ebonarm&lt;/a&gt;, who in some ways is similar to what Talos represents. &lt;a href=\"Count\"&gt;Count&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Charus%20Valga\"&gt;Charus Valga&lt;/a&gt; was the leader of Chorrol sometime before the Oblivion Crisis and was a staunch believer of Stendarr. He would later pass away after losing a battle from a &lt;a href=\"Nord\"&gt;Nord&lt;/a&gt;ic clansmen.\nHistory.\n&lt;a href=\"Merethic%20Era\"&gt;Merethic Era&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe War of Religion; the Narfinsel Schism.\nThe Heartland Elves of Cyrodiil worship either the &lt;a href=\"Aedra\"&gt;Aedra&lt;/a&gt; or the &lt;a href=\"Daedra\"&gt;Daedra&lt;/a&gt;. Notable Daedric-worshipping cities include &lt;a href=\"Abagarlas\"&gt;Abagarlas&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Delodiil\"&gt;Delodiil&lt;/a&gt;. This caused tension with the Western Elves and the Eastern Elves (along with the &lt;a href=\"Barsaebic%20Ayleids\"&gt;Barsaebic Ayleids&lt;/a&gt;), resulting in a conflict that would be known as the &lt;a href=\"Narfinsel%20Schism\"&gt;Narfinsel Schism&lt;/a&gt;, named after the city of Narfinsel. The Narfinsel Schism is largely unknown, although based on the name, and its only known conflict, the &lt;a href=\"Scouring%20of%20Wendelbek\"&gt;Scouring of Wendelbek&lt;/a&gt;, the war takes place throughout the Southern Niben and the &lt;a href=\"West%20Weald\"&gt;West Weald&lt;/a&gt;, mainly the &lt;a href=\"Nibenay\"&gt;Nibenay&lt;/a&gt;. The conflict had reached its climax with the earlier mentioned, Scouring of Wendelbek in &lt;a href=\"1E%20198\"&gt;1E 198&lt;/a&gt; which cast the Barsaebic Ayleids into &lt;a href=\"Black%20Marsh\"&gt;Black Marsh&lt;/a&gt; by order of &lt;a href=\"Glinferen\"&gt;Glinferen&lt;/a&gt;, the King of &lt;a href=\"Atatar\"&gt;Atatar&lt;/a&gt;. Even though the Daedric-worshippers defeated the Aedric-followers, the power of the Aedra would destroy the Ayleid civilization with the coming of the Slave Queen and the &lt;a href=\"White-Gold%20Catastrophe\"&gt;White-Gold Catastrophe&lt;/a&gt;.\n&lt;a href=\"First%20Era\"&gt;First Era&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe Fall of the Ayleids; St. Alessia the Slave Queen.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Heartland%20Elves\"&gt;Heartland Elves&lt;/a&gt; of Cyrodiil had control over the entire region, from as far as the &lt;a href=\"Abecean%20Sea\"&gt;Abecean Sea&lt;/a&gt; to the southern reaches of the &lt;a href=\"Topal%20Bay\"&gt;Topal Bay&lt;/a&gt;, to even the frozen north of the &lt;a href=\"Jerall%20Mountains\"&gt;Jerall Mountains&lt;/a&gt;. The &lt;a href=\"Nedic\"&gt;Nedic&lt;/a&gt; humans from the west would become the slaves of these Elves, which would continue for several years. Ancient Ayleid cities including &lt;a href=\"Fanacasecul\"&gt;Fanacasecul&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"Vindasel\"&gt;Vindasel&lt;/a&gt; were primarily used to torture their human slaves and forced them to commit things that normally would not do. This was the case for the city of &lt;a href=\"Sardavar%20Leed\"&gt;Sardavar Leed&lt;/a&gt;, which was used to breed humans, to create more slaves. The Nedes were not the only race to be bred in these chambers, the &lt;a href=\"Kothringi\"&gt;Kothringi&lt;/a&gt;, and the men of &lt;a href=\"Kreath\"&gt;Kreath&lt;/a&gt; were utilized by the Sardavar Nedes. One of these slaves was known as &lt;a href=\"Perrif\"&gt;Perrif&lt;/a&gt;, a young girl from an unknown tribe.\nThe young girl would pray to &lt;a href=\"Akatosh\"&gt;Akatosh&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Aedra\"&gt;Aedra&lt;/a&gt; to free her from the Daedric-worshipping Ayleids of Sardavar Leed. She would eventually escape the city of Sard and travel across the Great Forest to establish the holy city of &lt;a href=\"Sancre%20Tor\"&gt;Sancre Tor&lt;/a&gt;, on the edge of the Jerall Mountains. It was there Alessia created an army alongside &lt;a href=\"Morihaus\"&gt;Morihaus&lt;/a&gt;, the Demi-God. With an alliance formed between the &lt;a href=\"Nords\"&gt;Nords&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"Alessian%20Slave%20Rebellion\"&gt;Alessian Slave Rebellion&lt;/a&gt; ravaged the province and brought down the Ayleid reign over the slaves. When Alessia recruited &lt;a href=\"Pelinal%20Whitestrake\"&gt;Pelinal Whitestrake&lt;/a&gt;, the various Kings of the Ayleid Kingdom were killed at the hands of Whitestrake, such as &lt;a href=\"Fire%20King%20Hadhuul\"&gt;Fire King Hadhuul&lt;/a&gt;, who was slain at the city of &lt;a href=\"Ceyatatar\"&gt;Ceyatatar&lt;/a&gt;. In &lt;a href=\"1E%20243\"&gt;1E 243&lt;/a&gt;, Pelinal Whitestrake and the Alessian revolution circled the &lt;a href=\"Imperial%20City\"&gt;Imperial City&lt;/a&gt;, and Whitestrake defeated the Sorcerer King, &lt;a href=\"Umaril%20the%20Unfeathered\"&gt;Umaril the Unfeathered&lt;/a&gt;. Alessia would establish the First Empire of Cyrodiil and the &lt;a href=\"Eight%20Divines\"&gt;Eight Divines&lt;/a&gt;, paving the way for a new prosperous Tamriel. Many Ayleids had fled to &lt;a href=\"Valenwood\"&gt;Valenwood&lt;/a&gt;, establishing cities such as &lt;a href=\"Rulanyil%27s%20Fall\"&gt;Rulanyil's Fall&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Ne%20Salas\"&gt;Ne Salas&lt;/a&gt;.\n&lt;a href=\"Second%20Era\"&gt;Second Era&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe Rise of Varen Aquilarios; the Colovian Revolt.\nDuring the &lt;a href=\"Interregnum\"&gt;Interregnum&lt;/a&gt; roughly around &lt;a href=\"2E%20576\"&gt;2E 576&lt;/a&gt;, the province of Cyrodiil was under the reign of &lt;a href=\"Emperor%20Leovic\"&gt;Emperor Leovic&lt;/a&gt;, a member of the &lt;a href=\"Longhouse%20Emperors\"&gt;Longhouse Emperors&lt;/a&gt;, a reign of Emperors that hail from &lt;a href=\"the%20Reach\"&gt;the Reach&lt;/a&gt; and are affiliated with the &lt;a href=\"Daedra\"&gt;Daedra&lt;/a&gt;. It was around this time, Leovic had announced the legalization of Daedric worship, causing quite the uproar through the Imperial Province. One of these people was &lt;a href=\"Varen%20Aquilarios\"&gt;Varen Aquilarios&lt;/a&gt;, who was the Duke of &lt;a href=\"Chorrol\"&gt;Chorrol&lt;/a&gt;, hailing from the city of &lt;a href=\"Kvatch\"&gt;Kvatch&lt;/a&gt;. Varen was against this new decree and decided to rebel against the tyranny of the Reachmen Emperor. Thie event would be known as the &lt;a href=\"Colovian%20Revolt\"&gt;Colovian Revolt&lt;/a&gt; or Varen's Rebellion, and it would lead to one of Tamriel's greatest conflicts. Varen is conquest over Cyrodiil was done so with the help of &lt;a href=\"Mannimarco\"&gt;Mannimarco&lt;/a&gt;, who guided him through the procedure and aided him in taking cities throughout Cyrodiil. Varen formed a group of companions known as the &lt;a href=\"Five%20Companions\"&gt;Five Companions&lt;/a&gt; which consisted of Varen, Mannimarco, &lt;a href=\"Abnur%20Tharn\"&gt;Abnur Tharn&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Sai%20Sahan\"&gt;Sai Sahan&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Lyris%20Titanborn\"&gt;Lyris Titanborn&lt;/a&gt;.\nVaren's revolution had echoed across the province and had followers throughout Cyrodiil, with his leading stronghold being the city of &lt;a href=\"Bruma\"&gt;Bruma&lt;/a&gt;. Sai Sahan was able to liberate the city of &lt;a href=\"Leyawiin\"&gt;Leyawiin&lt;/a&gt; single-handedly from Leovic's Marauders, as well as, double agents within his own ranks, returning to Bruma with roughly around eighty-men scalps within his satchel, like the inglorious bastard he is. The war was bloody and seemingly endless, until the Colovian Duke of Chorrol had infiltrated the &lt;a href=\"Imperial%20City\"&gt;Imperial City&lt;/a&gt; and surrounded the palace. Varen stabbed the Reach Emperor through his blackened heart, on top of the &lt;a href=\"Ruby%20Throne\"&gt;Ruby Throne&lt;/a&gt;. It was there that Varen was crowned &lt;a href=\"Emperor\"&gt;Emperor&lt;/a&gt; of Cyrodiil, he would eventually marry &lt;a href=\"Clivia%20Tharn\"&gt;Clivia Tharn&lt;/a&gt;, of the Great &lt;a href=\"House%20Tharn\"&gt;House Tharn&lt;/a&gt; of the &lt;a href=\"Nibenay\"&gt;Nibenean East&lt;/a&gt;. Varen was not completely satisfied with his position; he desired to protect Cyrodiil by being able to wield the &lt;a href=\"Amulet%20of%20Kings\"&gt;Amulet of Kings&lt;/a&gt;. Varen wanted to become &lt;a href=\"Dragonborn%20%28Lore%29\"&gt;Dragonborn&lt;/a&gt;, a desire he would soon regret in the later years. Varen would gather the Five Companions and travel all across Tamriel to seek out the Amulet and to achieve Varen's dream to rule over Tamriel.\nThe Dark Anchors of Coldharbour; the Planemeld.\nIn &lt;a href=\"2E%20579\"&gt;2E 579&lt;/a&gt;, the Five Companions had finally found the &lt;a href=\"Amulet%20of%20Kings\"&gt;Amulet of Kings&lt;/a&gt; and traveled back to the Imperial City to initiate the process at the &lt;a href=\"Dragonfires\"&gt;Dragonfires&lt;/a&gt;. The Five Companions gathered around the brazier as Mannimarco began to process to change Varen into a real Dragonborn. Mannimarco had manipulated the Amulet, causing the magic to backfire, and breaking the Dragonfires. This event led to the barrier that protected &lt;a href=\"Nirn\"&gt;Nirn&lt;/a&gt; to open, unleashing &lt;a href=\"Molag%20Bal\"&gt;Molag Bal&lt;/a&gt;'s wrath to enter Nirn and conquer the continent of Tamriel. Mannimarco had elaborately constructed a plan to bring Molag Bal into Nirn by having Varen, rebel against Emperor Leovic, give him the motivation to become Dragonborn and to send him on a fool's errand to find the Amulet of Kings for him. This event became known as the &lt;a href=\"Soulburst\"&gt;Soulburst&lt;/a&gt;, and its explosion scoured across Cyrodiil, forming natural disasters one after the other. One such disaster had hit the city of Chorrol, and it was known as &lt;a href=\"the%20Sundering\"&gt;the Sundering&lt;/a&gt;. It had opened a large fissure that absorbed most of the town and revealed the planet's core and magma. Varen was enveloped by the Cold Flames of &lt;a href=\"Coldharbour\"&gt;Coldharbour&lt;/a&gt;, Sai Sahan had fled with the Amulet of Kings, storing it deep within Sancre Tor. Lyris Titanborn was captured and sentenced to the &lt;a href=\"Wailing%20Prison\"&gt;Wailing Prison&lt;/a&gt;, where she would work in Molag Bal's smithy. Abnur Tharn, being an opportunist decided to be Mannimarco's subordinate alongside his son, &lt;a href=\"Javad%20Tharn\"&gt;Javad Tharn&lt;/a&gt;. Mannimarco would lead the invasion force in a war known as the &lt;a href=\"Planemeld\"&gt;Planemeld&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe War of Three Banners; the War-torn Province.\nWith the disappearance of Varen Aquilarios, the &lt;a href=\"Ruby%20Throne\"&gt;Ruby Throne&lt;/a&gt; was vacant and void of an Emperor to rule the land. The Imperial City is seen as the pinnacle of power throughout Tamriel, whoever holds the Imperial City, can conquer the entirety of Tamriel. As a result, the provinces of Tamriel gathered to form alliances, to claim control over the continent. This coming conflict would be known as the &lt;a href=\"Alliance%20War\"&gt;Alliance War&lt;/a&gt;, and it would last for several hundred years, taking place all over Tamriel. From the east was the &lt;a href=\"Ebonheart%20Pact\"&gt;Ebonheart Pact&lt;/a&gt;, the weakest one in terms of connections, it consists of the &lt;a href=\"Nords\"&gt;Nords&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"Eastern%20Skyrim\"&gt;Eastern Skyrim&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"Dunmer\"&gt;Dunmer&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"Morrowind\"&gt;Morrowind&lt;/a&gt; (with the except of &lt;a href=\"House%20Telvanni\"&gt;House Telvanni&lt;/a&gt;), and the &lt;a href=\"Argonians\"&gt;Argonians&lt;/a&gt; of the border nations in &lt;a href=\"Black%20Marsh\"&gt;Black Marsh&lt;/a&gt;. From the west is the &lt;a href=\"Daggerfall%20Covenant\"&gt;Daggerfall Covenant&lt;/a&gt; consisting of the &lt;a href=\"Bretons\"&gt;Bretons&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"High%20Rock\"&gt;High Rock&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"Redguards\"&gt;Redguards&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"Hammerfell\"&gt;Hammerfell&lt;/a&gt;, and the &lt;a href=\"Orsimer\"&gt;Orsimer&lt;/a&gt; of the &lt;a href=\"Western%20Reach\"&gt;Western Reach&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Wrothgar\"&gt;Wrothgar&lt;/a&gt;. To the south was the &lt;a href=\"First%20Aldmeri%20Dominion\"&gt;First Aldmeri Dominion&lt;/a&gt;, which consisted of the &lt;a href=\"Altmer\"&gt;Altmer&lt;/a&gt; of the &lt;a href=\"Summerset%20Isles\"&gt;Summerset Isles&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"Bosmer\"&gt;Bosmer&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"Valenwood\"&gt;Valenwood&lt;/a&gt;, and the &lt;a href=\"Khajiit\"&gt;Khajiit&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"Elsweyr\"&gt;Elsweyr&lt;/a&gt;. The region of the Great Forest was mostly occupied by the First Aldmeri Dominion, from the Southern Heartlands to the reaches of &lt;a href=\"Brindle\"&gt;Castle Brindle&lt;/a&gt;. The city of Chorrol was under the control of the Daggerfall Covenant, who had substantially control throughout the Jerall Mountains and the Northern Great Forest. The Empire had abandoned their cities and strongholds due to the attacks caused by the Daedra and other disasters.\nWith the onslaught of war, the people of Central Cyrodiil have lost their livelihood, resulting in relocation or worse. A group of bandits known as the &lt;a href=\"Black%20Daggers\"&gt;Black Daggers&lt;/a&gt; had control over a majority of the western battlefield, other groups such as the &lt;a href=\"Shadowed%20Path\"&gt;Shadowed Path&lt;/a&gt; have inhabited the caves in the area such as &lt;a href=\"Nisin%20Cave\"&gt;Nisin Cave&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Pothole%20Caverns\"&gt;Pothole Caverns&lt;/a&gt;. The city of Chorrol was significantly affected by the Planemeld. When the Soulburst exploded, it caused natural disasters such as earthquakes to hit the surrounding region. The Chorrolian earthquake had revealed the inner magma flowing underneath Chorrol, creating a vast chasm that divided the city. The noxious fumes that spewed out of the chasm had led to many citizens to lose consciousness and fall into the magma. &lt;a href=\"Flame%20Atronach\"&gt;Flame Atronach&lt;/a&gt;s began to crawl out of the abyss, harassing the denizens of Chorrol. Flame Atronachs had spread throughout the Great Forest, seen near the ruins of &lt;a href=\"Ceyatatar\"&gt;Ceyatatar&lt;/a&gt;. The town of &lt;a href=\"Gottlesfont%20Priory\"&gt;Gottlesfont Priory&lt;/a&gt; was abandoned by its people, many of their fates are left unknown, most likely to go for Chorrol or the nearby Alliance fortification. The town of &lt;a href=\"Hackdirt\"&gt;Hackdirt&lt;/a&gt; was captured by the Black Daggers, causing many to flee to a refugee camp, somewhere in the &lt;a href=\"West%20Weald\"&gt;West Weald&lt;/a&gt;.\n&lt;a href=\"Third%20Era\"&gt;Third Era&lt;/a&gt;.\nFrom the Gates of Hell; the Oblivion Crisis.\nThroughout the years, many have tried to enter or bring the Nirn into Oblivion. One example is the Planemeld during the Reman Interregnum, and another would be the invasion of the &lt;a href=\"Battlespire\"&gt;Battlespire&lt;/a&gt;. In &lt;a href=\"3E%20433\"&gt;3E 433&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"Mythic%20Dawn\"&gt;Mythic Dawn&lt;/a&gt; cult of &lt;a href=\"Mehrunes%20Dagon\"&gt;Mehrunes Dagon&lt;/a&gt; had orchestrated several assassinations on the &lt;a href=\"Septim%20Dynasty\"&gt;Septim Dynasty&lt;/a&gt;, having murdered &lt;a href=\"Ebel%20Septim\"&gt;Ebel Septim&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Geldall%20Septim\"&gt;Geldall Septim&lt;/a&gt;. The Mythic Dawn had tracked down &lt;a href=\"Uriel%20Septim%20VII\"&gt;Uriel Septim VII&lt;/a&gt; deep within the &lt;a href=\"Imperial%20City%20Sewers\"&gt;Imperial City Sewers&lt;/a&gt;, accompanied by members of &lt;a href=\"the%20Blades\"&gt;the Blades&lt;/a&gt; and a &lt;a href=\"Hero%20of%20Kvatch\"&gt;prisoner&lt;/a&gt; who just so happened to be in the escape cell. The death of Uriel VII would bring about the &lt;a href=\"Oblivion%20Crisis\"&gt;Oblivion Crisis&lt;/a&gt;, a devastating invasion by Mehrunes Dagon. Uriel believed the prisoner held cosmic significance and gave them the &lt;a href=\"Amulet%20of%20Kings\"&gt;Amulet of Kings&lt;/a&gt;, telling them about an illegitimate heir and the Grandmaster of the Blades in &lt;a href=\"Weynon%20Priory\"&gt;Weynon Priory&lt;/a&gt;. With this information, the prisoner traveled to meet &lt;a href=\"Jauffre%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;Grandmaster Jauffre&lt;/a&gt; at Weynon Priory, on the outskirts of Chorrol. Jauffre tells the warrior about &lt;a href=\"Martin%20Septim\"&gt;Martin Septim&lt;/a&gt;, who was living in &lt;a href=\"Kvatch\"&gt;Kvatch&lt;/a&gt; as a Priest of &lt;a href=\"Akatosh\"&gt;Akatosh&lt;/a&gt;. The prisoner traveled to Kvatch to find the city under siege by the &lt;a href=\"Daedra\"&gt;Daedra&lt;/a&gt; and by entering the &lt;a href=\"Oblivion%20Gate\"&gt;Oblivion Gate&lt;/a&gt;, the warrior was able to break the siege."}

The Forest serves as a buffer between &lt;a href=\"Colovia\"&gt;Colovia&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Empire\"&gt;Empire&lt;/a&gt;'s capital city.\nThe Great Forest is thick with white-barked aspens, redwoods, and various other evergreen and broad-leaf trees. Ground cover is ferns, bushes, and uneven thatches of dark green grass. Though the weather in the forest is generally mild, the thick matte of trees makes visibility poor.\nThe larger boulders in the Forest are moss-covered and banded by black horizontal lines, suggesting layering and that the rocks are of sedimentary origin. The Forest consists of gently rolling hills that steepen in the east as the region gives way to the &lt;a href=\"Heartlands\"&gt;Heartlands&lt;/a&gt; and the Imperial City. North the land rises steeply to the &lt;a href=\"Orange%20Road\"&gt;Orange Road&lt;/a&gt;. The leaves here turn to fall colors. In the southeast, the Forest extends nearly to &lt;a href=\"Bravil%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;Bravil&lt;/a&gt;.\nWhile there are no significant &lt;a href=\"Regions%20%28Oblivion%29%23Bodies%20of%20Water\"&gt;bodies of water&lt;/a&gt;, nearly every road in Cyrodiil crosses the forest: the &lt;a href=\"Red%20Ring%20Road\"&gt;Red Ring&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Orange%20Road\"&gt;Orange&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Gold%20Road%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;Gold&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Silver%20Road\"&gt;Silver&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Black%20Road\"&gt;Black&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Green%20Road\"&gt;Green&lt;/a&gt;.\nFlora and fauna.\nThe Forest supports a great deal of varied &lt;a href=\"plant\"&gt;plant&lt;/a&gt; life. Fungus includes &lt;a href=\"Cinnabar%20Polypore%20Red%20Cap\"&gt;Cinnabar Polypore Red Cap&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Cinnabar%20Polypore%20Yellow%20Cap\"&gt;Cinnabar Polypore Yellow Cap&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Clouded%20Funnel%20Cap\"&gt;Clouded Funnel Cap&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Fly%20Amanita%20Cap\"&gt;Fly Amanita&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Green%20Stain%20Cup\"&gt;Green Stain Cup&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Steel-Blue%20Entoloma\"&gt;Steel-Blue Entoloma&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Summer%20Bolete\"&gt;Summer Bolete&lt;/a&gt;. Other plants that grow in the forest are &lt;a href=\"Flax%20Seeds\"&gt;flax&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Lady%27s%20Mantle\"&gt;Lady's Mantle&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Monkshood\"&gt;Monkshood&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Motherwort\"&gt;Motherwort&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Somnalius%20Plant\"&gt;Somnalius Plant&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"St.%20Jahn%27s%20Wort\"&gt;St. Jahn's Wort&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Tiger%20Lily\"&gt;Tiger Lily&lt;/a&gt;, and lots of &lt;a href=\"Viper%27s%20Bugloss\"&gt;Viper's Bugloss&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href=\"Bergamot%20Seeds\"&gt;Bergamot&lt;/a&gt; grows in the higher elevations. A few &lt;a href=\"Lavender%20Sprig\"&gt;Lavender&lt;/a&gt; plants can be found near the border with the Heartlands.\n&lt;a href=\"Creatures%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;Animals&lt;/a&gt; in the Great Forest include &lt;a href=\"Bear%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;bears&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Deer%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;deer&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Mountain%20Lion%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;mountain lions&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Rat%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;rats&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Spriggan%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;spriggans&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Troll%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;trolls&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Wolf%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;wolves&lt;/a&gt;.\nLocations.\nThe Colovian city of &lt;a href=\"Chorrol%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;Chorrol&lt;/a&gt; is located in the northwest portion of the Forest, near the base of the &lt;a href=\"Colovian%20Highlands\"&gt;Highlands&lt;/a&gt;. Author &lt;a href=\"Alessia%20Ottus\"&gt;Alessia Ottus&lt;/a&gt; praises Chorrol's Countess &lt;a href=\"Arriana%20Valga\"&gt;Arriana Valga&lt;/a&gt; as a \"very proper woman\" but also says that the town guards are \"lax in their duties, and fail to arrest and lock up the various beggars and thieves and gamblers and cheats who idle in the streets.\" Indeed, Ottus' \"&lt;a href=\"Guide%20to%20Chorrol\"&gt;Guide to Chorrol&lt;/a&gt;\" is the only of her Guides to have its own \"Shameful Features\" section.\nBecause the Forest is near the Imperial City and sits along several major trade routes, it is a fairly crowded region. The settlements of &lt;a href=\"Aleswell%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;Aleswell&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Brindle%20Home\"&gt;Brindle Home&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Harm%27s%20Folly\"&gt;Harm's Folly&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Odiil%20Farm\"&gt;Odiil Farm&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Weatherleah\"&gt;Weatherleah&lt;/a&gt; can be found in the Forest. The sizeable village of &lt;a href=\"Bleaker%27s%20Way%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;Bleaker's Way&lt;/a&gt; sits at the base of the hills that rise sharply to the Orange Road.\nTwo &lt;a href=\"Taverns%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;taverns&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"Inn%20of%20Ill%20Omen\"&gt;Inn of Ill Omen&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Faregyl%20Inn\"&gt;Faregyl Inn&lt;/a&gt;, are clustered on the south side of the Forest.\nAlso look for the warm and inviting &lt;a href=\"Gottlesfont%20Priory%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;Gottlesfont Priory&lt;/a&gt;, due east of Brindle Home. There is a bed at the priory that is always available for a traveler, though the &lt;a href=\"Hero%20of%20Kvatch\"&gt;Hero&lt;/a&gt; might have to wake up the middle-aged nun sleeping in the bed in order to use it. She won't mind. All &lt;a href=\"Ingredients%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;ingredients&lt;/a&gt; at the priory are free, and most have &lt;a href=\"Restore\"&gt;restorative&lt;/a&gt; properties. Likewise, a bevy of healing plants, notably &lt;a href=\"Fly%20Amanita%20Cap\"&gt;Fly Amanita&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Lady%27s%20Mantle\"&gt;Lady's Mantle&lt;/a&gt;, grow around the priory. Finally, a chapel at the priory can heal &lt;a href=\"Diseases%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;disease&lt;/a&gt;.\nAnother priory - &lt;a href=\"Weynon%20Priory%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;Weynon Priory&lt;/a&gt; - is just outside of Chorrol. It is the first location the Hero travels to in the &lt;a href=\"Main%20Quest%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;main quest&lt;/a&gt;. Weynon is a large priory, with a main building, chapel, lodge, graveyard, and stables.\n&lt;a href=\"Hackdirt%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;Hackdirt&lt;/a&gt;, an isolated and xenophobic village near the border with the &lt;a href=\"Colovian%20Highlands\"&gt;Colovian Highlands&lt;/a&gt;, has an &lt;a href=\"Moslin%27s%20Inn\"&gt;inn&lt;/a&gt; and a limited &lt;a href=\"Moslin%27s%20Dry%20Goods\"&gt;General Goods&lt;/a&gt; store.\nPoints of interest.\nThere are a total of four &lt;a href=\"Daedric%20Shrines%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;Daedric Shrines&lt;/a&gt; in the Great Forest. &lt;a href=\"Molag%20Bal\"&gt;Molag Bal&lt;/a&gt;, the father of vampires&lt;a href=\"http%3A//www.imperial-library.info/mwbooks/vampires.shtml\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, has a &lt;a href=\"Molag%20Bal%27s%20Shrine\"&gt;shrine&lt;/a&gt; just north of Gottlesfont Priory. &lt;a href=\"Shrine%20of%20Mephala\"&gt;Mephala's Shrine&lt;/a&gt; is also in the Great Forest, although it appears below the first \"a\" in \"Heartlands\" on official Imperial Maps.&lt;a href=\"http%3A//www.imperial-library.info/maps/cyrodiil_ingame.jpg\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Clavicus%20Vile%27s%20Shrine\"&gt;Clavicus Vile's Shrine&lt;/a&gt; is near the Red Ring Road, and the &lt;a href=\"Shrine%20of%20Hircine\"&gt;Shrine of Hircine&lt;/a&gt; is located in the Forest east of &lt;a href=\"Charcoal%20Cave\"&gt;Charcoal Cave&lt;/a&gt;.\n&lt;a href=\"Shadeleaf%20Copse\"&gt;Shadeleaf Copse&lt;/a&gt; is one of the region's few ponds; one of the region's few &lt;a href=\"Nirnroot%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;Nirnroots&lt;/a&gt; grow there. &lt;a href=\"Harcane%20Grove\"&gt;Harcane Grove&lt;/a&gt;, home of the &lt;a href=\"Unicorn%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;Unicorn&lt;/a&gt;, is in the south of the Forest, due east of the &lt;a href=\"Inn%20of%20Ill%20Omen\"&gt;Inn of Ill Omen&lt;/a&gt;. A lucrative secret entrance to &lt;a href=\"Ceyatatar%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;Ceyatatar&lt;/a&gt; can be found northwest of &lt;a href=\"Greenmead%20Cave\"&gt;Greenmead Cave&lt;/a&gt; and southwest of the main entrance to Ceyatatar."}

As soon as one sees the gate begin to rise up out of the ground, get into position to run into the gate. The battle raging outside pauses when they enter, so get inside as soon as possible.\nInside the Great Gate.\nAfter entering, immediately head towards the left and head for the first door to the Caverns. Inside the caverns, slay only the Daedra in their way and head for the door to one of the lesser towers. Inside this tower, head for the top and kill the Daedra guarding the Corpse Masher, then ride up to the top, killing any other Daedra in the way.\nAt the top, activate the Gate Control, then head back down through the door. Go past the opening gate, and deal with the &lt;a href=\"Dremora%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;Dremora&lt;/a&gt;. If one can't finish the fight quickly either ignore them or knock them off the ledge into the pits of lava.\nThe Tower.\nEnter the tower and if there is more than 8\u20139 minutes, one can take the tower at a \"usual\" Oblivion gate speed, however do not be tempted to check every single loot container or body. Proceed up into the Rending Halls, killing any Daedra in their way. Be sure to use the map to avoid getting lost. Exit back into the tower at the top of the halls, and continue up the tower.\nOne can run through and basically ignore anything that takes more than a few swings or spells to kill. Either kill the &lt;a href=\"Sigil%20Keeper%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;Sigil Keeper&lt;/a&gt;, or if they have &lt;a href=\"Lockpick%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;lockpicks&lt;/a&gt;, ignore him. He has the Sigil key that unlocks Sigillum Sanguis, which is otherwise protected by an Average lock.\nAlternative way.\nIf they are really short on time, then ignore the Daedra or knock them off the ledge (if possible). The only Daedra they might need to kill is the Sigil Keeper since he has the key, and even he can be skipped if they have lockpicks, an &lt;a href=\"Open%20Average%20Lock\"&gt;Open Average Lock&lt;/a&gt; spell, or the &lt;a href=\"Skeleton%20Key\"&gt;Skeleton Key&lt;/a&gt;.\nWhen inside the Sigillum Sanguis, head up to the top to remove the &lt;a href=\"Sigil%20Stone%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;Sigil Stone&lt;/a&gt;. The Great Gate will shut down and the Hero is back on the battlefield where all the soldiers are clapping their hands of their success.\nGreat Gate closed.\nFind Martin and give him the Sigil Stone, he will be very pleased at the success of closing the gate and will proceed to &lt;a href=\"Cloud%20Ruler%20Temple%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;Cloud Ruler Temple&lt;/a&gt; to prepare for the next step.\nQuest is completed.\nTribute to the Hero.\nAfter completion of the quest a statue will be erected in the Hero's honor by the citizens of &lt;a href=\"Bruma%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;Bruma&lt;/a&gt; near the northern gate.\nThe statue depicts the &lt;a href=\"Races%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;race&lt;/a&gt; of the Hero and the weapon and armor the character had on them that the game deems \"best.\""}

While I am not gifted with a sharp gift of words, I have learned the stories of the Companions before me, and set to record them that they might not be lost when I am. Hereafter is the list of notable &lt;a href=\"Harbinger%20%28Rank%29\"&gt;Harbingers&lt;/a&gt; of the Companions, those who lead us through the darkness to glories in &lt;a href=\"Sovngarde%20%28Location%29\"&gt;Sovngarde&lt;/a&gt;.\nNotes on the Harbinger: &lt;a href=\"the%20Companions\"&gt;the Companions&lt;/a&gt; have never had a true leader since &lt;a href=\"Ysgramor\"&gt;Ysgramor&lt;/a&gt; -- none have been mighty enough to corral the great hearts that beat within Jorrvaskr. While others like mages and thieves need the blessings of their hierarchy to know how to dress, we Companions are capable of leading our own destinies to glory. The Harbinger advises, resolves disputes, and helps to clarify when questions arise of the nature of honor. In the thousands of years the Companions have held at Jorrvaskr, there have been Harbingers both terrible and brilliant, those known for their arm, those for their hearts, and those for their minds. Here are listed some of the most gloried Harbingers, who inspire song and deed.\nYsgramor: the first Harbinger, the first Man, the bringer of Words, and the one who first bound the Companions to honor in that far off land of long ago. Better people have written of him, so I will not attempt to meet their words.\n&lt;a href=\"Jeek%20of%20the%20River\"&gt;Jeek of the River&lt;/a&gt;: Captain of the Jorrvaskr during the Return, discoverer of the &lt;a href=\"Skyforge%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Skyforge&lt;/a&gt;, founder of &lt;a href=\"Whiterun\"&gt;Whiterun&lt;/a&gt;, and keeper of the original oath of the Companions, now lost to time. While other crews sought glory in conquest, his was the first to settle and serve as protector for the less war-gifted in the land as they came behind.\n&lt;a href=\"Mryfwiil%20the%20Withdrawn\"&gt;Mryfwiil the Withdrawn&lt;/a&gt;: Several hundred years after the death of Ysgramor, the Companions as we now know them were soldiers for hire, little better than mercenaries. Our services could be purchased for the fighting of wars, but the commitment to individual honor meant that often Shield-Brothers would be forced to face each other on the field of battle. The bonds of honor which bind the Companions threaten to break, until Mryfwiil, in his wisdom, decreed that we would no longer be party to any war or political conflict of any kind. Because of his steady hand, the Companions today are known as impartial arbiters of honor, in addition to their glories on the field of battle.\n&lt;a href=\"Cirroc%20the%20Lofty\"&gt;Cirroc the Lofty&lt;/a&gt;: The first Harbinger to not be of ancestral &lt;a href=\"Atmoran\"&gt;Atmoran&lt;/a&gt; blood. This was around the time that the Nords began to think of themselves as such, and there were great disputes about purity and the legacy of Ysgramor. Cirroc first came to Jorrvaskr as a servant, but the &lt;a href=\"Redguard\"&gt;Redguard&lt;/a&gt; quickly proved his mettle when treated disrespectfully by one of the less honor-bound warriors of the time. Granted the stature of an honorary Companion after saving the life of Harbinger Tulvar the Unmentioned, he became known as the most capable of Shield-Brothers in the hall, with speed and cunning surpassing any of the old Atmoran stock. His time as Harbinger was short-lived, but it is said that his field knowledge of bladework continues to pass to every new Companion through their training.\n&lt;a href=\"Henantier%20the%20Outsider\"&gt;Henantier the Outsider&lt;/a&gt;: The first &lt;a href=\"Mer\"&gt;elven&lt;/a&gt; Harbinger. Like Cirroc before him, he was initially subject to ridicule when arriving at Jorrvaskr, for this was the time (near the closing of the first era) when elves were not permitted to be full Companions, and few were even allowed to see the inside of the hall. Henantier was humble in the daylight hours, performing any task asked of him. At night, he trained fiercely in the outside yard, allowing himself only minutes of sleep before resuming his servant duties the next day. So he toiled through several Harbingers, never resting, never complaining, and always keeping his mind and body sharp. Given his long life, he came to be trusted by the new Companions as the one who them learn the ways of honor.\nWhen one such pupil had aged into an old man and become Harbinger himself, Henantier was the one at his deathbed. With all Companions assembled, he named Henantier as his successor, saying \"even an elf can be born with the heart of a &lt;a href=\"Nord\"&gt;Nord&lt;/a&gt; sometimes.\" There were some number of Companions who laid down their weapons that day, but those who remained knew the truth of honor, and it is their legacy we continue to bear.\n&lt;a href=\"Macke%20of%20the%20Piercing%20Eyes\"&gt;Macke of the Piercing Eyes&lt;/a&gt;: A Harbinger known for her great beauty, but any who underestimated her on account of it would never make the mistake again. Was said to have once stared down half an opposing army, then slaughtered the remainder single-handedly. Her disappearance in her 8th year as Harbinger has never been explained, though many slanderous lies claim to make accountings for it.\n&lt;a href=\"Kyrnil%20Long-Nose\"&gt;Kyrnil Long-Nose&lt;/a&gt;: After the dark periods in the late second era, when a string of false and dishonorable Harbingers laid claim to Jorrvaskr, it was Kyrnil Long-Nose who gathered the true hearts of the Companions in the wilds and stormed Jorrvaskr itself, killing the usurpers and returning honor through blood, in the old ways. He began the tradition of trusted advisors called &lt;a href=\"The%20Circle\"&gt;the Circle&lt;/a&gt; (after our great lord Ysgramor's council of captains) who would serve as examples to the younger, newer Companions.\nBy ensuring that the notions of honor can have an unbroken string of tradition, he steadied the course of the Companions and restored our destinies to that of Ysgramor's, pressing ever onwards to Sovngarde."}

Like Cirroc before him, he was initially subject to ridicule when arriving at Jorrvaskr, for this was the time (near the closing of the &lt;a href=\"First%20Era\"&gt;First Era&lt;/a&gt;) when Elves were not permitted to be full Companions, and few were even allowed to see the inside of the hall. Henantier was humble in the daylight hours, performing any task asked of him. At night, he trained fiercely in the outside yard, allowing himself only minutes of sleep before resuming his servant duties the next day. So he toiled through several Harbingers, never resting, never complaining, and always keeping his mind and body sharp. Given his long life, he came to be trusted by the new Companions as the one who helped them learn the ways of honor.\nWhen one such pupil had aged into an old man and become Harbinger himself, Henantier was the one at his deathbed. With all Companions assembled, he named Henantier as his successor, saying \"even an Elf can be born with the heart of a Nord sometimes.\" There were some number of Companions who laid down their weapons that day, but those who remained knew the truth of honor, and it is their legacy we continue to bear.\n&lt;a href=\"Macke%20of%20the%20Piercing%20Eyes\"&gt;Macke of the Piercing Eyes&lt;/a&gt;: A Harbinger known for her great beauty, but any who underestimated her on account of it would never make the mistake again. She was said to have once stared down half an opposing army, then slaughtered the remainder single-handedly. Her disappearance in her eighth year as Harbinger has never been explained, though many slanderous lies claim to make accountings for it.\n&lt;a href=\"Kyrnil%20Long-Nose\"&gt;Kyrnil Long-Nose&lt;/a&gt;: After the dark periods of the Second Era, when a string of false and dishonorable Harbingers laid claim to Jorrvaskr, it was Kyrnil Long-Nose who gathered the true hearts of the Companions in the wilds and stormed Jorrvaskr itself, killing the usurpers and returning honor through blood, in the old ways. He began the tradition of trusted advisors called &lt;a href=\"the%20Circle\"&gt;the Circle&lt;/a&gt; (after our great lord Ysgramor's council of captains) who would serve as examples to the younger, newer Companions.\nBy ensuring that the notions of honor can have an unbroken string of tradition, he steadied the course of the Companions and restored our destinies to that of Ysgramor's, pressing ever onwards to &lt;a href=\"Sovngarde\"&gt;Sovngarde&lt;/a&gt;."}

{"id": "1516", "revid": "29733383", "url": "https://elderscrolls.fandom.com/wiki?curid=1516", "title": "Great Houses", "text": "There are five organizations of &lt;a href=\"Dunmer\"&gt;Dunmer&lt;/a&gt; in the region of &lt;a href=\"Morrowind\"&gt;Morrowind&lt;/a&gt; that are known as Great Houses. They have their origins in ancient &lt;a href=\"Velothi\"&gt;Velothi&lt;/a&gt; tribes, and function effectively as political parties within the Morrowind polity, as well as controlling much of the trade and local administration in the province.\nRepresentatives from each of the Great Houses form the &lt;a href=\"Grand%20Council\"&gt;Grand Council&lt;/a&gt;, the body that has ruled Morrowind since the late &lt;a href=\"First%20Era\"&gt;First Era&lt;/a&gt;. The Houses themselves also have ruling councils, which enforce House policy and conduct.\nGreat Houses that have been referenced in the games to date are &lt;a href=\"House%20Dagoth\"&gt;House Dagoth&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"House%20Dres\"&gt;House Dres&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"House%20Hlaalu\"&gt;House Hlaalu&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"House%20Indoril\"&gt;House Indoril&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"House%20Redoran\"&gt;House Redoran&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"House%20Sadras\"&gt;House Sadras&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"House%20Telvanni\"&gt;House Telvanni&lt;/a&gt;. All but House Dagoth and House Sadras had a stake in Morrowind's governance for most of its history. House Dagoth was destroyed following the events at the &lt;a href=\"Battle%20of%20Red%20Mountain\"&gt;Battle of Red Mountain&lt;/a&gt;, while House Sadras replaced House Hlaalu following the &lt;a href=\"Red%20Year\"&gt;Red Year&lt;/a&gt;. During the time of &lt;a href=\"Resdayn\"&gt;Resdayn&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;a href=\"First%20Era\"&gt;First Era&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"Dwemer\"&gt;Dwemer&lt;/a&gt; were also accorded the status of a House, referred to as \"House Dwemer.\"\nHistory.\nEach Great House is made up of a network of families and subclans, that date back to the tribal cultures that emerged following decline of &lt;a href=\"Velothi\"&gt;Velothi&lt;/a&gt; culture in the late &lt;a href=\"Merethic%20Era\"&gt;Merethic Era&lt;/a&gt;. However, sources detailing the nature of the Great Houses only go back as far as the First Era.\nFirst Era.\nThe nascent Chimer factions were constantly at war with one another, and with the &lt;a href=\"Dwemer\"&gt;Dwemer&lt;/a&gt;. This fractiousness, it is claimed, led to their conquest by the &lt;a href=\"Nords\"&gt;Nords&lt;/a&gt; in the early &lt;a href=\"First%20Era\"&gt;First Era&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe First Council.\nThis ended at the time of the &lt;a href=\"War%20of%20Succession\"&gt;War of Succession&lt;/a&gt; in 1E 416, where the &lt;a href=\"Chimer\"&gt;Chimer&lt;/a&gt; and Dwemer were united to destroy the &lt;a href=\"First%20Nordic%20Empire\"&gt;First Nordic Empire&lt;/a&gt;. During this time, the predecessor organizations that would lead to the Great Houses were formed, with the &lt;a href=\"First%20Council\"&gt;First Council&lt;/a&gt; as its governing body. Armed conflict between the Houses still continued to some degree during this time, however, despite the formation of an overarching government for &lt;a href=\"Resdayn\"&gt;Resdayn&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe First Council dissolved some time after the ejection of the Nords, over religious differences between the Dwemer and the other houses, and possibly the discovery of the &lt;a href=\"Heart%20of%20Lorkhan\"&gt;Heart of Lorkhan&lt;/a&gt; beneath &lt;a href=\"Red%20Mountain\"&gt;Red Mountain&lt;/a&gt;. These disagreements grew into the &lt;a href=\"War%20of%20the%20First%20Council\"&gt;War of the First Council&lt;/a&gt;. This war saw the disappearance of the Dwemer at the &lt;a href=\"Battle%20of%20Red%20Mountain\"&gt;Battle of Red Mountain&lt;/a&gt;, and the eradication of House Dagoth shortly after.\nThe Grand Council.\nFollowing the Battle, the First Council was reformed into the Grand Council, consisting of the Orthodox Houses of Dres, Hlaalu, Indoril, Redoran and Telvanni. Also emerging at this time was the &lt;a href=\"Tribunal%20Temple\"&gt;Tribunal Temple&lt;/a&gt;, following the apotheosis of &lt;a href=\"Almalexia\"&gt;Almalexia&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Sotha%20Sil\"&gt;Sotha Sil&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Vivec\"&gt;Vivec&lt;/a&gt;, and the outlawing of open House conflict, precipitating the rise of the &lt;a href=\"Morag%20Tong\"&gt;Morag Tong&lt;/a&gt; in order to continue such disputes less openly, although this did not end all open conflict between the houses. The &lt;a href=\"Tribunal\"&gt;Tribunal&lt;/a&gt; also founded the Grand Council out of the ashes of the First Council, to govern the province.\nSeveral nomadic groups of Dunmer refused to worship the Tribunal, continuing the old ancestor and &lt;a href=\"Daedra\"&gt;Daedra&lt;/a&gt; worship that was prevalent before the War of the First Council. Although previously identified as a distinct group from the settled mer, these &lt;a href=\"Ashlanders\"&gt;Ashlanders&lt;/a&gt; became more marked in their differences as the House Dunmer integrated further with the Tribunal Temple and the Ashlanders retained the old ways. Over time, the webs of allegiances between the settled Dunmer and the peace brought by the Grand Council meant that they developed rapidly, forcing the nomadic Ashlanders into the less fertile lands of the province.\nSecond Era.\nThe Armistice.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Treaty%20of%20the%20Armistice\"&gt;Treaty of the Armistice&lt;/a&gt; was agreed after several skirmishes between the Empire and Resdayn during Tiber Septim's conquests, and created the Imperial Province of Morrrowind. The Houses were split on how to react to this, with several refusing to fight the empire directly, leaving House Redoran the impossible task of defending alone against the Empire. House Hlaalu was enthusiastically supporting the treaty, while House Indoril vehemently opposed it, and others remained neutral. However, the terms of the Armistice allow Morrowind a high degree of local autonomy and self-governance in cultural affairs, leading to several houses, particularly those supportive of slavery, to later support the terms of the Armistice.\nThird Era.\nThe Hortator.\nAs a result of Imperial and Temple machinations, the &lt;a href=\"Hortator\"&gt;Hortator&lt;/a&gt; emerged with the support of all Great Houses during the late Third Era, to defeat &lt;a href=\"Dagoth%20Ur%20%28Character%29\"&gt;Dagoth Ur&lt;/a&gt;. At this time, King Llethan was assassinated and replaced by &lt;a href=\"Helseth\"&gt;Helseth&lt;/a&gt;. Helseth replaced all the members of the Grand Council, shaking up the Houses out of a long-established order.\nFourth Era.\nThe Red Year.\n&lt;a href=\"Baar%20Dau\"&gt;Baar Dau&lt;/a&gt; fell and &lt;a href=\"Red%20Mountain\"&gt;Red Mountain&lt;/a&gt; erupted in 4E 5, destroying &lt;a href=\"Vivec%20City%20%28Morrowind%29\"&gt;Vivec City&lt;/a&gt; and causing much destruction elsewhere. This destroyed much of the power base of House Indoril, who became synonymous with the Temple itself. House Redoran survived with much of its power base intact, who rose to fill the power vacuum left by the event. Meanwhile, House Hlaalu was removed from the Grand Council and replaced by House Sadras.\nPresent Houses.\nHouse Redoran.\nHouse Redoran is a martial house that consider themselves the hereditary defenders of Morrowind. The House Redoran prizes the three virtues of duty, gravity, and piety, and they are typically considered one of the more honorable Houses in the region. The house claims their first duty is to the Temple, although not as part of its structure as House Indoril is. The House motto is, \"A Redoran is a warrior whose duty is first to the Tribunal, second to House Redoran, and third to family and clan.\"\nThey have holdings on &lt;a href=\"Vvardenfell\"&gt;Vvardenfell&lt;/a&gt; island and west of the Morrowind mainland. Their holdings in the mainland of Morrowind include a large portion of the northwest of the province. Their capital on Vvardenfell and council seat for much of their history was &lt;a href=\"Ald%27ruhn\"&gt;Ald'ruhn&lt;/a&gt;. In the &lt;a href=\"Fourth%20Era\"&gt;Fourth Era&lt;/a&gt;, They also control much of the island of &lt;a href=\"Solstheim\"&gt;Solstheim&lt;/a&gt;, including the settlement of Raven Rock, following the departure of the Empire in 4E 16.\nThe house was seen to be in decline for much of the Third Era, losing influence on Vvardenfell as the more expansionist and underhand Telvanni and Hlaalu houses, in addition to suffering from severe levels of crime organized by the Cammona Tong and the Thieves Guild. The most severe blow came during the &lt;a href=\"Oblivion%20Crisis\"&gt;Oblivion Crisis&lt;/a&gt;, when Ald'ruhn was destroyed.\nAfter the Oblivion Crisis, House Redoran established holdings on Solstheim and mainland Morrowind, taking over Raven Rock after the withdrawal of the Empire. On the mainland, House Redoran was one of the least damaged houses following the Red Year and was able to take over the position of leadership on Morrowind's Grand Council.\nHouse Telvanni.\nHouse Telvanni is a house governed by powerful and idiosyncratic mage-lords, with little formal code of conduct being imposed by the House hierarchy. As a result, many of the most powerful Telvanni lords work in solitude, and do not concern themselves directly with House affairs. During the &lt;a href=\"Three%20Banners%20War\"&gt;Three Banners War&lt;/a&gt;, despite being a member of the &lt;a href=\"Ebonheart%20Pact\"&gt;Ebonheart Pact&lt;/a&gt;, the Telvanni were most concerned with keeping the other Pact members out of their territories.\nDespite this, there is a \"de facto\" code of conduct in the House, which considers that might makes right. The House motto reflects this, being, \"The forceful expression of will gives true honor to the Ancestors.\" This cut-throat attitude also means that murdering one's political opponents is a perfectly acceptable way of resolving disputes. It is also the way that the current ruling &lt;a href=\"Archmagister\"&gt;Archmagister&lt;/a&gt; must be deposed.\nTheir indifference to politics is reflected in the structure of their House governance. While the Telvanni council is made up of some of the most powerful wizards in the House, they are represented and their votes are cast by \"Mouths,\" who speak for their patron in council so that the actual councillor does not have to. Unlike Houses Redoran and Hlaalu, most Telvanni Councillors do not live at the Vvardenfell district seat of &lt;a href=\"Sadrith%20Mora\"&gt;Sadrith Mora&lt;/a&gt;, but have their own towers, populated by their retainers. Their isolationism is also reflected in the governance of their main territories. Non-members of the House are required to have \"hospitality papers\" to be in Sadrith Mora at all.\nDespite being laissez-faire in their attitude to internal and political affairs, House Telvanni is one of the most competitive when it comes to obtaining resources and power. The House was in direct competition with House Hlaalu for land on Vvardenfell for much of the Third Era, and dominated much of Vvardenfell's eastern regions. Alongside House Dres, House Telvanni is one of the more vocal proponents of slavery on Morrowind, as it allows them to have a fresh supply of both test subjects and cheap labor. They even worked with House Hlaalu to break the &lt;a href=\"Mages%20Guild\"&gt;Mages Guild&lt;/a&gt; monopoly on transportation magic in the Third Era.\nDuring the Oblivion Crisis, the House was rumored to be defending Morrowind directly by invading and closing Oblivion gates. However, the House suffered badly from the subsequent Argonian invasion in 4E 6, with some fearing that the House would be wiped out altogether.\nHouse Indoril.\n&lt;a href=\"House%20Indoril\"&gt;House Indoril&lt;/a&gt; is one of two Great Houses that does not have holdings on Vvardenfell. Its capital is Almalexia, which also functions as the capital of Morrowind as a whole. The vast majority of members serve the Temple, a tendency which only increased following the events of Red Year and the fall of the Tribunal, resulting in all of House Indoril's power passing into the hands of the Temple in the Fourth Era.\nThe Chimer warlord Nerevar was an Indoril, and the House claimed that the Tribunal as a whole came from the House. These connections allowed them to maintain a strong control of Morrowind's governance throughout much of Morrowind's history.\nWhen the &lt;a href=\"Third%20Empire\"&gt;Third Empire&lt;/a&gt; invaded, House Indoril wished to fight to the death rather than submit, and proposed fighting a guerrilla war against the invaders. Following the Armistice, many House Indoril nobles committed suicide rather than accept the treaty, and lost a great deal of influence because of it.\nIn the game , citizens of Cyrodiil speak of House Indoril being in ruins as the result of machinations of the new king, &lt;a href=\"King%20Hlaalu%20Helseth%20%28Tribunal%29\"&gt;Hlaalu Helseth&lt;/a&gt;, and his House Hlaalu and &lt;a href=\"House%20Dres\"&gt;House Dres&lt;/a&gt; allies.\nHouse Dres.\n&lt;a href=\"House%20Dres\"&gt;House Dres&lt;/a&gt; has a power based on agriculture and the &lt;a href=\"Slavery\"&gt;slave trade&lt;/a&gt;, and is located in the south-eastern part of Morrowind, and has no holdings on Vvardenfell. Previously a strong and rich House, with a thriving economy, its influence on Morrowind politics has weakened considerably since Morrowind's surrender to the Third Empire, which it strongly opposed.\nHouse Dres is the most conservative of Morrowind's Great Houses, to the extent that the &lt;a href=\"Daedra\"&gt;Daedra&lt;/a&gt; worship of the Chimer is still commonly practiced by its members. During the war in which Morrowind became a province of the Empire of Tiber Septim, it was one of the Houses, along with House Indoril and House Redoran, to resist Imperial forces, opposing the treaty even after Redoran agreed to its terms.\nMore recently, after the events of , House Dres has apparently undergone some significant changes. Since then, &lt;a href=\"King%20Hlaalu%20Helseth%20%28Tribunal%29\"&gt;King Hlaalu Helseth&lt;/a&gt; has outlawed slavery in Morrowind, but Dres is apparently prospering in spite of this.\nHouse Sadras.\n&lt;a href=\"House%20Sadras\"&gt;House Sadras&lt;/a&gt; is a great house that rose to prominence during the &lt;a href=\"Fourth%20Era\"&gt;Fourth Era&lt;/a&gt;. They joined the ruling Council of Morrowind, along with House Telvanni, Dres, Indoril and Redoran.\nDisbanded/Revoked Houses.\nHouse Hlaalu.\nHouse Hlaalu was always one of the weaker Great Houses, and so tended to rely on trade and relations with external political forces to keep up with the rest of the Houses. This meant that they were one of the few sincere members of the Ebonheart Pact during the Three Banners War. The House itself positions this as the ability to be nimble and adjust to events, which is for them a political necessity. The House had holdings on Vvardenfell during the Third Era, and its old capital was &lt;a href=\"Narsis\"&gt;Narsis&lt;/a&gt;. However, the key members of the Hlaalu council all resided on Vvardenfell.\nHouse Hlaalu was always pro-Imperial in its outlook, urging accommodation with Tiber Septim in the period leading up to the Armistice. When the head of the Grand Council, an Indoril, refused to sign the treaty that Vivec negotiated, he was assassinated and replaced by a member of House Hlaalu. Their co-operation with Imperial authorities during the Third Era allowed them to expand aggressively and build and support many new settlements on Vvardenfell. The exact status of these settlements in the political climate following the events of Red Year and the Argonian invasion is unknown. Following the abdication of &lt;a href=\"Queen%20Barenziah\"&gt;Queen Barenziah&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Athyn%20Llethan\"&gt;Athyn Llethan&lt;/a&gt;, a member of House Hlaalu, became King of Morrowind. He died shortly after her return shortly before the events of .\nHouse Hlaalu saw its status of Great House revoked during the Fourth Era. This was due to Empire (supposedly) abandoning Morrowind during the Oblivion Crisis. Since the other Great Houses could not take their anger out on the Empire, they targeted House Hlaalu, who were staunch Imperial supporters. The House became an outcast and a pariah, losing almost all of its power.\nHouse Dagoth.\nHouse Dagoth was one of the six Chimer Great Houses of Morrowind, counted among the \"Secular Houses,\" alongside House Dwemer. Known for being subtle, the House was condemned following the Battle of Red Mountain for treachery, possibly because they invited outsiders into what was an internal Dunmer conflict. This destruction is likely to have happened immediately following the battle itself.\nBefore this series of events, &lt;a href=\"Voryn%20Dagoth\"&gt;Voryn Dagoth&lt;/a&gt;, the leader of the House, allied himself with Nerevar and the Tribunal. In some accounts, it is Voryn Dagoth that uncovers the Dwemer use of the &lt;a href=\"Heart%20of%20Lorkhan\"&gt;Heart of Lorkhan&lt;/a&gt;, and so may have been the instigator for the war in the first place. Other accounts place Voryn Dagoth as a traitor to his own people who assisted the Tribunal. After the battle, Nerevar left Voryn Dagoth to guard the tools while Nerevar and the Tribunal discussed what to do with them. When the Tribunal returned, Voryn Dagoth (now referred to as &lt;a href=\"Dagoth%20Ur%20%28Character%29\"&gt;Dagoth Ur&lt;/a&gt;) drove them off and fled with the tools into Red Mountain's depths. The &lt;a href=\"Ash%20Vampire\"&gt;Ash Vampire&lt;/a&gt;s, referred to as Dagoth's \"kin\" in various texts, also likely fled with him at this time.\nAfter this, the mere mention of House Dagoth was considered offensive. They continued to exist for many years, and gathered in force under Dagoth Ur during the Third Era, gathering followers and carrying out a range of covert operations with the ultimate goal of establishing a new theocracy in Morrowind, worshipping Dagoth's created god, &lt;a href=\"Akulakhan\"&gt;Akulakhan&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe House was ultimately destroyed in the Third Era, by the actions of the &lt;a href=\"Nerevarine\"&gt;Nerevarine&lt;/a&gt;.\nMinor Houses.\nIn addition to the Great Houses themselves, there are Minor Houses in Morrowind, which generally owe allegiance to one or other of the Great Houses. Due to their inferior political status, there is little detail available about them, so what is known is presented here.\nHouse Sotha.\n&lt;a href=\"House%20Sotha\"&gt;House Sotha&lt;/a&gt; was one of the minor Houses of Vvardenfell until its destruction by &lt;a href=\"Mehrunes%20Dagon\"&gt;Mehrunes Dagon&lt;/a&gt; in the times of &lt;a href=\"Indoril%20Nerevar\"&gt;Indoril Nerevar&lt;/a&gt;. The only one who survived the destruction of the House by Dagon was &lt;a href=\"Sotha%20Sil\"&gt;Sotha Sil&lt;/a&gt;, who was rescued by Vivec.\nHouse Mora.\nHouse Mora was one of the minor houses of Morrowind. They are said to have produced a hero who at one time drove the Nords from Morrowind. Notable members were Queen &lt;a href=\"Barenziah\"&gt;Barenziah&lt;/a&gt;, King &lt;a href=\"Moraelyn\"&gt;Moraelyn&lt;/a&gt;, and Empress &lt;a href=\"Katariah\"&gt;Katariah&lt;/a&gt;. In time the house had disbanded, many of its members being adopted into House Hlaalu.\n&lt;a href=\"House%20Sathil\"&gt;House Sathil&lt;/a&gt;.\nHouse Sathil is a House which used to have holdings on Solstheim. They were allied with House Indoril until the Great Houses showed themselves unable to properly defend Morrowind, causing them to declare independence. Their holdings on Solstheim were lost to House Redoran sometime between the Red Year and &lt;a href=\"4E%20201\"&gt;4E 201&lt;/a&gt;."}
{"id": "8835", "revid": "32045548", "url": "https://elderscrolls.fandom.com/wiki?curid=8835", "title": "Great Houses of Morrowind", "text": "Great Houses of Morrowind is a &lt;a href=\"Books%20%28Morrowind%29\"&gt;book&lt;/a&gt; in .\nContents.\nIn modern times &lt;a href=\"Morrowind\"&gt;Morrowind&lt;/a&gt; is ruled by five &lt;a href=\"Great%20Houses\"&gt;Great Houses&lt;/a&gt;: &lt;a href=\"House%20Hlaalu%20%28Morrowind%29\"&gt;House Hlaalu&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"House%20Redoran%20%28Morrowind%29\"&gt;House Redoran&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"House%20Telvanni%20%28Morrowind%29\"&gt;House Telvanni&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"House%20Indoril\"&gt;House Indoril&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"House%20Dres\"&gt;House Dres&lt;/a&gt;. Only three of these Houses have interests in &lt;a href=\"Vvardenfell%20%28Morrowind%29\"&gt;Vvardenfell&lt;/a&gt;. The three Great Houses on Vvardenfell identify themselves by their traditional colors: red for Redoran, yellow for Hlaalu, and brown for Telvanni. Thus, members of House Hlaalu may be referred to collectively as Yellows.\nThe Great Houses traditions derive from ancient &lt;a href=\"Dunmer\"&gt;Dunmer&lt;/a&gt; clan and tribes, but now function as political parties. Dunmer Great House membership is largely a matter of birth and marriage, but &lt;a href=\"Imperial\"&gt;Imperial&lt;/a&gt; colonists may also become retainers of a Great House, or may be adopted into a Great House. Initially an outlander may gain status in a house as an oath-bonded hireling, pledging exclusive loyalty to a single house and forsaking ambitions with all other houses. Later, after faithful service and advancement in lower ranks, an outlander may seek adoption into a Great House. Adoption and advancement to higher ranks in a Great House requires that a Great House councilor stand as sponsor for the candidate's character and loyalty. Finding a councilor to sponsor an outlander often involves performing a great service for the prospective sponsor.\nHouse Redoran is one of the three Dunmer Great Houses with holdings on Vvardenfell. The Redoran prize the virtues of duty, gravity, and piety. Duty is to one's own honor, and to one's family and clan. Gravity is the essential seriousness of life. Life is hard, and events must be judged, endured, and reflected upon with due care and earnestness. Piety is respect for the gods, and the virtues they represent. A light, careless life is not worth living. Redoran settlements are designed in the Dunmer village style, built of local materials, with organic curves and undecorated exteriors inspired by the landscape and by the shells of giant native insects. Redoran villages are typically centered on &lt;a href=\"Tribunal%20Temple\"&gt;Temple&lt;/a&gt; compounds and their courtyards, with huts and tradehouses gathered around a central plaza, as in the &lt;a href=\"West%20Gash\"&gt;West Gash&lt;/a&gt; village of &lt;a href=\"Gnisis\"&gt;Gnisis&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href=\"Ald%27ruhn\"&gt;Ald'ruhn&lt;/a&gt;, the Redoran district seat, is exceptional, with its distinctive feature being the colossal prehistoric &lt;a href=\"Ald%27ruhn-under-Skar\"&gt;bug shell&lt;/a&gt; that has been adapted as the &lt;a href=\"Ald%27ruhn%2C%20Manor%20District\"&gt;house's council house&lt;/a&gt;.\nAs a result of its close relationship with the Imperial administration, House Hlaalu has emerged as politically and economically dominant among the Great Houses of Vvardenfell and Morrowind. Hlaalu welcomes Imperial culture and law, &lt;a href=\"Imperial%20Legion\"&gt;Imperial Legion&lt;/a&gt;s and bureaucracy, and Imperial freedom of trade and religion. Hlaalu still honors the old Dunmer ways\u2014the ancestors, the Temple, and the noble houses\u2014but has readily adapted to the rapid pace of change and progress in the Imperial provinces. Unlike the other Great Houses, which are largely hostile to non-Dunmer, House Hlaalu aspires to live in peace and harmony with the other races, and to share in the growth and prosperity of the Empire. Hlaalu public buildings\u2014tradehouses and craft guilds, manors and council halls\u2014are designed as simple multi-storied buildings roughly rectangular in plan, featuring arched entranceways and modest decorated exteriors. More modest one-story private dwellings follow the same plan, except with less decoration. Hlaalu plantation estates resemble Temple compounds, with walled precincts enclosing outbuildings for craftsmen and servants, dominated by a grand manor residence in place of a Temple shrine.\nThe wizard-lords of &lt;a href=\"House%20Telvanni%20%28Morrowind%29\"&gt;House Telvanni&lt;/a&gt; have traditionally isolated themselves, pursuing wisdom and mastery in solitude. But certain ambitious wizards-lords, their retainers, and clients have entered whole-heartedly into the competition to control and exploit Vvardenfell's land and resources, building towers and bases all along the eastern coast. According to Telvanni principles, the powerful define the standards of virtue, and the Telvanni are unwilling to allow the ambitious Hlaalu to dominate Vvardenfell's untapped resources by default. Telvanni architecture is dominated by the wizards' tower, a fantastic organic form grown and sculpted from stems, caps, and root-like holdfasts of the giant native mushrooms. Telvanni villages are comprised of smaller mushroom pods hollowed out for craftsmen and commoners. Open-air markets often include the giant cages displaying the wares of the slave masters.\nHouse Indoril and House Dres are the two Great Houses without holdings or interest in Vvardenfell. Indoril District occupies the heartland of Morrowind, comprising the lands south of the Inner Sea and the eastern coast. The city of &lt;a href=\"Almalexia%20%28City%29\"&gt;Almalexia&lt;/a&gt; is located in &lt;a href=\"Indoril%20District\"&gt;Indoril District&lt;/a&gt;, and the Indoril are orthodox and conservative supporters of the Temple and Temple authority. House Indoril is openly hostile to Imperial culture and religion, and preserves many traditional Dunmer customs and practices in defiance of Imperial law. Dres District is in the south of Morrowind, bordering the swamps and marshes of Black Marsh. House Dres is an agrarian agricultural society, and its large saltrice plantations rely completely on slave labor for their economic viability. Always firm Temple supporters, &lt;a href=\"House%20Dres\"&gt;House Dres&lt;/a&gt; is hostile to Imperial law and culture, and in particular opposed to any attempts to limit the institution of &lt;a href=\"slavery\"&gt;slavery&lt;/a&gt;."}

However, Hammerfell refused the conditions of the treaty, and as a result, it was renounced from the Empire. Between 4E 175 and &lt;a href=\"4E%20180\"&gt;4E 180&lt;/a&gt;, an independent Hammerfell fought the remainder of the &lt;a href=\"Dominion%20Military\"&gt;Dominion Army&lt;/a&gt; alone, before signing the &lt;a href=\"Second%20Treaty%20of%20Stros%20M%27kai\"&gt;Second Treaty of Stros M'kai&lt;/a&gt;.\nHistory.\nThe Great War.\nIn &lt;a href=\"4E%20168\"&gt;4E 168&lt;/a&gt;,\u00a0&lt;a href=\"Titus%20Mede%20II\"&gt;Titus Mede II&lt;/a&gt;\u00a0ascended to the throne and inherited a weakened empire. The glory days of the Septims were a distant memory. &lt;a href=\"Valenwood\"&gt;Valenwood&lt;/a&gt; and\u00a0&lt;a href=\"Elsweyr\"&gt;Elsweyr&lt;/a&gt;\u00a0were gone, ceded to the Thalmor.\u00a0&lt;a href=\"Black%20Marsh\"&gt;Black Marsh&lt;/a&gt;\u00a0had been lost to Imperial rule since the aftermath of the Oblivion Crisis.\u00a0&lt;a href=\"Morrowind\"&gt;Morrowind&lt;/a&gt;\u00a0had never recovered fully from the eruption of Red Mountain.\u00a0&lt;a href=\"Hammerfell\"&gt;Hammerfell&lt;/a&gt;\u00a0was plagued by infighting between Crowns and Forebears. Only\u00a0&lt;a href=\"High%20Rock\"&gt;High Rock&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Cyrodiil\"&gt;Cyrodiil&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Skyrim\"&gt;Skyrim&lt;/a&gt; remained prosperous and peaceful. Emperor Titus Mede II had only a few short years to consolidate\u00a0his rule before his leadership was put to the ultimate test.\nOn the 30th of Frostfall, &lt;a href=\"4E%20171\"&gt;4E 171&lt;/a&gt;, the\u00a0&lt;a href=\"Aldmeri%20Dominion%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Aldmeri Dominion&lt;/a&gt;\u00a0sent an ambassador to the\u00a0&lt;a href=\"Imperial%20City\"&gt;Imperial City&lt;/a&gt;\u00a0with a gift\u00a0in a covered cart and an ultimatum for the new\u00a0&lt;a href=\"Emperor\"&gt;Emperor&lt;/a&gt;. The long list of demands included staggering tributes, disbandment of the\u00a0&lt;a href=\"Blades\"&gt;Blades&lt;/a&gt;, outlawing the worship of\u00a0&lt;a href=\"Talos\"&gt;Talos&lt;/a&gt;, and ceding large sections of Hammerfell to the Dominion. Despite the warnings of his generals of the Empire's military weakness, Emperor Titus Mede II rejected the ultimatum. The Thalmor ambassador upended the cart, spilling over a hundred heads on the floor \u2013 every Blades agent in\u00a0&lt;a href=\"Summerset%20Isles\"&gt;Summerset&lt;/a&gt;\u00a0and Valenwood had been executed. So began the Great War, which would consume the Empire and the Aldmeri Dominion for the next five years. Within days, Aldmeri armies invaded Hammerfell and Cyrodiil simultaneously. A strong force commanded by the Thalmor general Lord Naarifin attacked Cyrodiil from the south, marching out of hidden camps in northern Elsweyr and flanking the Imperial defenses along the Valenwood border. Leyawiin soon fell to the invaders, while Bravil was cut off and besieged.\nAt the same time, an Aldmeri army under Lady Arannelya crossed into western Cyrodiil from Valenwood, bypassing\u00a0&lt;a href=\"Anvil\"&gt;Anvil&lt;/a&gt;\u00a0and\u00a0&lt;a href=\"Kvatch\"&gt;Kvatch&lt;/a&gt;\u00a0and crossing into Hammerfell. Smaller Aldmeri forces landed along the southern coastline of Hammerfell. The disunited\u00a0&lt;a href=\"Redguard\"&gt;Redguard&lt;/a&gt;\u00a0forces offered only scattered resistance to the invaders, and much of the southern coastline was quickly overrun. The greatly outnumbered Imperial legions\u00a0retreated across the\u00a0&lt;a href=\"Alik%27r%20Desert\"&gt;Alik'r Desert&lt;/a&gt;\u00a0in the now-famous March of Thirst. However, the surprising initial success of Lord Naarifin's attack led the Thalmor to believe that the Empire was weaker than they had thought. The capture of the Imperial City itself and the complete overthrow of the Empire thus became their primary objective over the next two years. As is known, the Thalmor nearly achieved their objective. It was only because of the Emperor's determined leadership during the Empire's darkest hour that this disaster was averted. During &lt;a href=\"4E%20172\"&gt;4E 172&lt;/a&gt;, the Aldmeri advanced deeper into Cyrodiil.\u00a0&lt;a href=\"Bravil\"&gt;Bravil&lt;/a&gt;\u00a0and Anvil both fell to the invaders. By the end of the year, Lord Naarifin had advanced to the very walls of the Imperial City. There were fierce naval clashes in\u00a0&lt;a href=\"Lake%20Rumare\"&gt;Lake Rumare&lt;/a&gt;\u00a0and along the\u00a0&lt;a href=\"Niben\"&gt;Niben&lt;/a&gt;\u00a0as the Imperial forces attempted to hold the eastern bank.\nIn Hammerfell, the Thalmor were content to consolidate their gains as they took control of the whole southern coastline, which was in fact their stated objective in the ultimatum delivered to the Emperor. Of the southern cities, only\u00a0&lt;a href=\"Hegathe\"&gt;Hegathe&lt;/a&gt;\u00a0still held out.\nThe survivors of the March of Thirst regrouped in northern Hammerfell, joined by reinforcements from High Rock. The year &lt;a href=\"4E%20173\"&gt;4E 173&lt;/a&gt; saw stiffening Imperial resistance in Cyrodiil, but the seemingly inexorable Aldmeri advance continued. Fresh legions from Skyrim bolstered the Emperor's main army in the Imperial City, but the Aldmeri forced the crossing of the Niben and began advancing in force up the eastern bank. By the end of the year, the Imperial City was surrounded on three sides \u2013 only the northern supply route to\u00a0&lt;a href=\"Bruma\"&gt;Bruma&lt;/a&gt;\u00a0remained open.\nIn Hammerfell, Imperial fortunes took a turn for the better. In early 4E 173, a Forebear army from\u00a0&lt;a href=\"Sentinel\"&gt;Sentinel&lt;/a&gt;\u00a0broke the siege of Hegathe (a Crown city), leading to the reconciliation of the two factions. Despite this, Lady Arannelya's main army succeeded in crossing the Alik'r Desert. The Imperial Legions under General Decianus met them outside\u00a0&lt;a href=\"Skaven\"&gt;Skaven&lt;/a&gt;\u00a0in a bloody and indecisive clash. Decianus withdrew and left Arannelya in possession of Skaven, but the Aldmeri were too weakened to continue their advance.\nIn &lt;a href=\"4E%20174\"&gt;4E 174&lt;/a&gt;, the Thalmor leadership committed all available forces to the campaign in Cyrodiil, gambling on a decisive victory to end the war once and for all. During the spring, Aldmeri reinforcements gathered in southern Cyrodiil, and on 12th of Second Seed, they launched a massive assault on the Imperial City itself. One army drove north to completely surround the city, while Lord Naarifin's main force attacked the walls from the south, east, and west. The Emperor's decision to fight his way out of the city rather than make a last stand was a bold one. No general dared advise him to abandon the capital, but Titus II was proven right in the end.\nWhile the Eighth Legion fought a desperate (and doomed) rearguard action on the walls of the city, Titus II broke out of the city to the north with his main army, smashing through the surrounding Aldmeri forces and linking up with reinforcements marching south from Skyrim under General Jonna. However, the capital fell to the invaders and the infamous Sack of the Imperial City began. The\u00a0&lt;a href=\"Imperial%20Palace\"&gt;Imperial Palace&lt;/a&gt;\u00a0was burned, the\u00a0&lt;a href=\"White-Gold%20Tower\"&gt;White-Gold Tower&lt;/a&gt;\u00a0itself looted, and all manner of atrocities carried out by the vengeful\u00a0&lt;a href=\"Elves\"&gt;Elves&lt;/a&gt;\u00a0on an innocent populace.\nIn Hammerfell, General Decianus was preparing to drive the Aldmeri back from Skaven when he was ordered to march for Cyrodiil. Unwilling to abandon Hammerfell completely, he allowed a great number of \"invalids\" to be discharged from the Legions before they marched east. These veterans formed the core of the army that eventually drove Lady Arannelya's forces back across the Alik'r late in 4E 174, taking heavy losses on their retreat from harassing attacks by the Alik'r warriors.\nDuring the winter of 4E 174\u2013&lt;a href=\"4E%20175\"&gt;175&lt;/a&gt;, the Thalmor seem to have believed that the war in Cyrodiil was all but over. They made several attempts to negotiate with Titus II. The Emperor encouraged them in their belief that he was preparing to surrender; meanwhile, he gathered his forces to retake the Imperial City.\nIn what is now known as the\u00a0&lt;a href=\"Battle%20of%20the%20Red%20Ring\"&gt;Battle of the Red Ring&lt;/a&gt;, a battle that will serve as a model for Imperial strategists for generations to come, Titus II divided his forces into three armies. One army, with the legions from Hammerfell under General Decianus, was hidden in the\u00a0&lt;a href=\"Colovian%20Highlands\"&gt;Colovian Highlands&lt;/a&gt;\u00a0near\u00a0&lt;a href=\"Chorrol\"&gt;Chorrol&lt;/a&gt;. The Aldmeri were unaware that he was no longer in Hammerfell, possibly because the Imperial veterans Decianus had left behind led Lady Arannelya to believe that she still faced an Imperial army. The second army, largely of Nord legions under General Jonna, took up position near\u00a0&lt;a href=\"Cheydinhal\"&gt;Cheydinhal&lt;/a&gt;. The main army was commanded by the Forgotten Hero wearing the Emperor's armor, and would undertake the main assault of the Imperial City from the north. On the 30th of Rain's Hand, the bloody Battle of the Red Ring began as General Decianus swept down on the city from the west, while General Jonna's legionnaires drove south along the\u00a0&lt;a href=\"Red%20Ring%20Road\"&gt;Red Ring Road&lt;/a&gt;. In a two-day assault, Jonna's army crossed the Niben and advanced west, attempting to link up with Decianus's legions and thus surround the Imperial City. Lord Naarifin was taken by surprise by Decianus's assault, but Jonna's troops faced bitter resistance as the Aldmeri counterattacked from Bravil and Skingrad. The heroic\u00a0&lt;a href=\"Nord\"&gt;Nord&lt;/a&gt;\u00a0legionnaires held firm, however, beating off the piecemeal Aldmeri attacks. By the fifth day of the battle, the Aldmeri army in the Imperial City was surrounded. Titus II led the assault from the north, personally capturing Lord Naarifin. It is rumored that the Emperor wielded the famed sword\u00a0&lt;a href=\"Goldbrand\"&gt;Goldbrand&lt;/a&gt;, although this has never been officially confirmed by the Imperial government. An attempt by the Aldmeri to break out of the city to the south was blocked by the unbreakable shieldwall of General Jonna's battered legions. In the end, the main Aldmeri army in Cyrodiil was completely destroyed. The Emperor's decision to withdraw from the Imperial City in 4E 174 was bloodily vindicated. Lord Naarifin was kept alive for thirty-three days, hanging from the White-Gold tower. It is not recorded where his body was buried, if it was buried at all. One source claims he was carried off by a winged Daedra on the thirty-fourth day.\nThe White-Gold Concordat.\nIn 4E 175, the &lt;a href=\"White-Gold%20Concordat\"&gt;White-Gold Concordat&lt;/a&gt; was signed, officially ending the war. Two provisions in the treaty had serious impacts on what remained of the Empire. First, large portions of southern Hammerfell were ceded to the Aldmeri Dominion. The Redguards, outraged that the Empire paid for the treaty with their lands, began their own separate war with the Aldmeri. As a result, the Empire renounced Hammerfell as an Imperial province. After five more years they fought the Aldmeri to a standstill and signed their own &lt;a href=\"Second%20Treaty%20of%20Stros%20M%27kai\"&gt;treaty&lt;/a&gt;, after which the Aldmeri withdrew from Hammerfell, leaving southern Hammerfell devastated. Relations between Hammerfell and Cyrodiil became bitter, as Hammerfell believed that their combined strength could have truly defeated the Dominion. Secondly, the worship of &lt;a href=\"Talos\"&gt;Talos&lt;/a&gt; was outlawed, and the &lt;a href=\"Nine%20Divines\"&gt;Nine Divines&lt;/a&gt; became the &lt;a href=\"Eight%20Divines\"&gt;Eight Divines&lt;/a&gt; once more. Many &lt;a href=\"Nords\"&gt;Nords&lt;/a&gt; saw this as an affront, notably &lt;a href=\"Ulfric%20Stormcloak\"&gt;Ulfric Stormcloak&lt;/a&gt;, and many continued to worship Talos in secret. The Nords' anger over the White-Gold Concordat is one of the driving forces behind the &lt;a href=\"Civil%20War\"&gt;Civil War&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Skyrim\"&gt;Skyrim&lt;/a&gt;.\nHad the Concordat not been signed the Empire would have been unable to halt the Aldmeri onslaught, and thus been unable to survive the Great War.\nAftermath.\nThalmor found in Skyrim have revealed a different name to describe the Great War: \"The First War with the Empire.\" This suggests that not only do the Thalmor intend a second Great War, but they have already begun to plan its execution. Conversely, it is heavily implied, most notably in the remarks made by various members of the Legion, that the Empire is taking measures of its own.\nGuilds.\nThe Blades.\nIn the days before the Great War, the &lt;a href=\"Blades\"&gt;Blades&lt;/a&gt; began a shadow war against the Thalmor, believing that they were superior enough to handle the conflict. However, this arrogance led to the destruction of the Blades. In response to their aggression, the Thalmor systematically hunted down and exterminated the Blades in all parts of Tamriel. The remaining members of the Blades were in hiding in Skyrim at the outbreak of Skyrim's Civil War. It is suggested that the Thalmor would have destroyed the Blades eventually in any case, since they saw the Blades' connection to Talos as a potential threat.\nVeterans.\nIn \"Skyrim\", there are a number of Great War veterans."}

{"id": "62346", "revid": "3222214", "url": "https://elderscrolls.fandom.com/wiki?curid=62346", "title": "Greater Ward", "text": "Greater Ward is an &lt;a href=\"Rank\"&gt;\"Adept\"-level&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Restoration%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;restoration&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Spell%20Tomes%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;spell&lt;/a&gt; in .\nEffects.\nGreater Ward acts as a magic shield for &lt;a href=\"Block%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;blocking&lt;/a&gt; spells and reducing physical damage by increasing the caster's defense. In order to cast the spell, it must to be charged up to full strength. The shield does not block physical attacks such as &lt;a href=\"Arrows%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;arrows&lt;/a&gt; or melee weapons, only spells and other magical attacks are absorbed. Enemy spell-casters frequently use this spell if their opponent also casts magic. Of the three &lt;a href=\"Ward%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;ward&lt;/a&gt; spells, Greater Ward ranks first, with &lt;a href=\"Steadfast%20Ward%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Steadfast Ward&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Lesser%20Ward%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Lesser Ward&lt;/a&gt; ranking below it. \nUsefulness.\n&lt;a href=\"The%20Mage%20Stone%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Mage builds&lt;/a&gt; employ wards best, especially if they do not have high &lt;a href=\"Skills%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;skill levels&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"Perks%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;perks&lt;/a&gt; invested in the\u00a0&lt;a href=\"Light%20Armor%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Light Armor&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"Heavy%20Armor%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Heavy Armor&lt;/a&gt;\u00a0skills. Additionally, wards are effective against &lt;a href=\"Necromancer%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;necromancers&lt;/a&gt; and other mages who cast &lt;a href=\"Destruction%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Destruction&lt;/a&gt; spells. Wards can also dispel magic damage inflicted by &lt;a href=\"Soul%20Gem%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;soul gem&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Traps%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;traps&lt;/a&gt;.\n&lt;a href=\"Summon\"&gt;Summon&lt;/a&gt;ing &lt;a href=\"atronach\"&gt;atronach&lt;/a&gt;s or &lt;a href=\"Undead%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;undead&lt;/a&gt; may make better \"shields\" than wards for an armor-less mage. Employing this option also frees up a hand for &lt;a href=\"Dual%20Wielding\"&gt;double casting&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Destruction%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Destruction&lt;/a&gt; spells.\u00a0\nIt could easily be argued that this ward, as well as the others, is a very specialized type of defensive spell with limited applications. The majority of attacks that just about any player will face in the game will be physical rather than magical, and while the greater ward will add 80 points to the player's armor rating when cast, archers and nearby melee attackers can quickly negate those 80 points because the ward does not literally block arrows or the weapons of melee attackers. It is all very well for a skilled player to be so equipped that he or she can project and maintain a ward at no cost more or less indefinitely, but this simply is not necessary very often, nor is it the only way to deal with a spell-casting enemy mage. An alternative method would be for the player to use a shield enchanted with &lt;a href=\"Resist%20Magic%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Resist Magic&lt;/a&gt; coupled with the &lt;a href=\"Elemental%20Protection%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Elemental Protection&lt;/a&gt; perk, which decreases incoming fire, frost, and shock damage by 50%. The shield will provide the player with protection from magical as well as physical attacks simultaneously while utilizing just one piece of equipment, leaving the other hand free to use a weapon or a spell. Admittedly, it is fun and challenging for a player to test his or her skills against an enemy mage by using only magical defensive and offensive abilities, but frankly such straightforward, one on one encounters are fairly rare. It is much more common for a player to be outnumbered by a diverse group of antagonists like the &lt;a href=\"Forsworn\"&gt;Forsworn&lt;/a&gt;, for example, and such groups frequently have semi-skilled spellcasters along with archers and melee attackers. In these situations, even a continuous ward will only provide protection from enemy spellcasters, while the enchanted shield/block perk mentioned earlier will provide protection from all attackers.\u00a0\nHowever, wards also block &lt;a href=\"shouts\"&gt;shouts&lt;/a&gt;, which can prove very useful against &lt;a href=\"Draugr%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;draugr&lt;/a&gt; and some &lt;a href=\"Dragons%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;dragons&lt;/a&gt;, even a lesser ward can stop the player from being throw around or disarmed. Wards can be used to block the &lt;a href=\"Poison%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;poison&lt;/a&gt; attacks of &lt;a href=\"Frostbite%20Spider%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Frostbite Spiders&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Chaurus%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Chaurus&lt;/a&gt;, as the game classes them as spells. Additionally, you move faster while casting a ward than you do while raising a shield, unless the Block Runner perk is gained."}

To the north is the Jodewood region, to the west, is the &lt;a href=\"Tarlain%20Heights\"&gt;Tarlain Heights&lt;/a&gt;, to the south is the &lt;a href=\"Long%20Coast\"&gt;Long Coast&lt;/a&gt;, and to the east is the region of &lt;a href=\"Pelletine\"&gt;Pelletine&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"Elsweyr\"&gt;Elsweyr&lt;/a&gt;. Green Hall's second largest settlement is the pseudo-city of &lt;a href=\"Cormount\"&gt;Cormount&lt;/a&gt;, located on the northern road to the Reaper's March gate. The &lt;a href=\"Ossuary%20of%20Telacar\"&gt;Ossuary of Telacar&lt;/a&gt; is a large ruin that takes up a significant portion of the eastern canyon.\nHistory.\n&lt;a href=\"Second%20Era\"&gt;Second Era&lt;/a&gt;.\nAyrenn's True Coronation; Trouble at Elden Root.\nDuring the &lt;a href=\"Interregnum\"&gt;Interregnum&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"2E%20582\"&gt;2E 582&lt;/a&gt;, the leader of the &lt;a href=\"First%20Aldmeri%20Dominion\"&gt;First Aldmeri Dominion&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Queen%20Ayrenn\"&gt;Queen Ayrenn&lt;/a&gt; traveled to the city of Elden Root to further ensure her role as the leader of the Aldmeri Dominion. The Orrery in &lt;a href=\"Elden%20Root\"&gt;Elden Root&lt;/a&gt; was the only way to show this to the denizens of the Dominion. Elden Root was established as the capital of the Aldmeri Dominion since it is very close to the Cyrodiil Battlefield in the northeast but is also close to the provinces of Elsweyr and the Summerset Isles. The Dominion planned to establish embassies for the Altmer and the Khajiits in Elden Root. Construction of both embassies was under the administration of &lt;a href=\"Ambassador%20Tarinwe\"&gt;Ambassador Tarinwe&lt;/a&gt;, an Altmer member of the Thalmor. Tension rose in Elden Root when the &lt;a href=\"Altmer%20Embassy\"&gt;Altmer Embassy&lt;/a&gt; was completed yet the Khajiit Embassy was delayed several times, seemingly intentional.\nConstruction of the Khajiit Embassy was to begin around last year in 2E 581. Camoran Aeradan tasked an agent of the Dominion, a warrior named the &lt;a href=\"Vestige\"&gt;Vestige&lt;/a&gt;, to uncover the blunders of the embassy. Ambassador Tarinwe explains that she planned to have the Khajiits build the ministry themselves, rather than using the Dominion workers to make it. The Vestige was able to uncover that Tarinwe left useless equipment in the storage room and had Wood Elven workers dig stones near the &lt;a href=\"Elden%20Hollow\"&gt;Elden Hollow&lt;/a&gt;. Aeradan hired &lt;a href=\"Azareth\"&gt;Azareth&lt;/a&gt; of the &lt;a href=\"Vinedusk%20Rangers\"&gt;Vinedusk Rangers&lt;/a&gt; to investigate the missing stonemasons, it was revealed that Tarinwe was foiling the plans of the embassy and hired smugglers to bring in the supplies. Tarinwe escaped into the Middens after the Vestige interrogated her. She was working for the &lt;a href=\"Veiled%20Heritance\"&gt;Veiled Heritance&lt;/a&gt; to ruin Ayrenn's ratification ceremony, as revenge for the events in &lt;a href=\"Auridon\"&gt;Auridon&lt;/a&gt; with &lt;a href=\"High%20Kinlady%20Estre\"&gt;High Kinlady Estre&lt;/a&gt;. Tarinwe was captured and put on trial in Elden Root.\nBeneath the Stars; The Heart of Anumaril.\nQueen Ayrenn needed to complete the ratification ceremony to earn the trust of the Wood Elves and the &lt;a href=\"Khajiit\"&gt;Khajiit&lt;/a&gt;s. The Orrery in Elden Root had the ability to reveal the true nature of the user and to show their worthiness as a leader. To use the Orrery, the Dominion needed several essential items to get it working. They needed a Divine Spark, an Ayleid Source of Power, and an operator of the Orrery. Prince Naemon sent the Vestige to retrieve the three items to continue the ceremony. The Vestige traveled to the &lt;a href=\"Reliquary%20of%20Stars\"&gt;Reliquary of Stars&lt;/a&gt; in Northern Green Hall to find an &lt;a href=\"Heart%20of%20Anumaril\"&gt;Ayleid source of power&lt;/a&gt; among the &lt;a href=\"Ayleid%20Ruins\"&gt;Ayleid Ruins&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Mages%20Guild\"&gt;Mages Guild&lt;/a&gt; traveled to the Reliquary of Stars to study the ancient ruins and the estranged artifacts dating back to the &lt;a href=\"Alessian%20Slave%20Rebellion\"&gt;Alessian Slave Rebellion&lt;/a&gt;. The Vestige met with the leader of the expedition, &lt;a href=\"Laranalda\"&gt;Laranalda&lt;/a&gt;, who was looking for the Heart of Anumaril as well. She asks for help since members of the team vanished into the ruins. A &lt;a href=\"Dremora\"&gt;Dremora&lt;/a&gt; named &lt;a href=\"Ukaezai\"&gt;Ukaezai&lt;/a&gt; was the caretaker of the reliquary and was manipulating the mages, to trap them in her flesh garden. Ukaezai was using the mages to use the Heart of Anumaril to restore her body. The Vestige defeated her and took the Heart of Anumaril back to Elden Root.\nThe Tragedy of Prince Naemon; The Orrery.\nThe Vestige was successfully able to retrieve the components to use the Orrery. From the city of &lt;a href=\"Southpoint\"&gt;Southpoint&lt;/a&gt;, the Vestige brought &lt;a href=\"Daraneth\"&gt;Conservator Daraneth&lt;/a&gt; after an issue with &lt;a href=\"Sheogorath\"&gt;Sheogorath&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"Daedric%20Prince\"&gt;Daedric Prince&lt;/a&gt; of Madness. From the ruins of the &lt;a href=\"Falinesti%20Winter%20Site\"&gt;Falinesti Winter Site&lt;/a&gt;, the Vestige brought a divine spark in the form of &lt;a href=\"Rajhin%27s%20Mantle\"&gt;Rajhin's Mantle&lt;/a&gt; after freeing the spirit of &lt;a href=\"Nairume\"&gt;Nairume&lt;/a&gt; from &lt;a href=\"Rajhin\"&gt;Rajhin&lt;/a&gt;, the Khajiiti God of Trickery. With these items and the Heart of Anumaril from the Reliquary of Stars, the ratification ceremony was able to proceed. With the necessary items placed into their correct position, the Orrery was fully operational. Prince Naemon took this time to bind the observers of the Orrery and foolishly entered underneath the Orrery. Naemon's experience was sublime, through his eyes, he saw the &lt;a href=\"White-Gold%20Tower\"&gt;White-Gold Tower&lt;/a&gt; in the center of the &lt;a href=\"Tamriel\"&gt;Tamriel&lt;/a&gt;. His vision darkened and his judgment view was fading. The Orrery transformed Naemon into the personification of his character, changed into an &lt;a href=\"Ogrim\"&gt;Ogrim&lt;/a&gt;, he launched onto Ayrenn, blaming her for this mistake. The Vestige killed Naemon swiftly, and without a second thought, the ceremony continued.\nAyrenn entered the Orrery's light and was enveloped in its divine power. Ayrenn envisioned the White-Gold Tower and the &lt;a href=\"Imperial%20City\"&gt;Imperial City&lt;/a&gt; under the eagle banner of the &lt;a href=\"Aldmeri%20Dominion\"&gt;Aldmeri Dominion&lt;/a&gt;. A new empire that emphasized the dream that Ayrenn had always sought for, ever since her youth. Ayrenn returned reborn, a real leader of the Aldmeri Dominion. The events that happened in the Orrery would affect the Aldmeri Dominion as well as the future of Tamriel.\n&lt;a href=\"Third%20Era\"&gt;Third Era&lt;/a&gt;.\nGreen Hall during the Imperial Simulacrum.\nDuring the &lt;a href=\"Imperial%20Simulacrum\"&gt;Imperial Simulacrum&lt;/a&gt; from &lt;a href=\"3E%20389\"&gt;3E 389&lt;/a&gt; to &lt;a href=\"3E%20399\"&gt;3E 399&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Emperor\"&gt;Emperor&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Uriel%20Septim%20VII\"&gt;Uriel Septim VII&lt;/a&gt; was imprisoned along with &lt;a href=\"Talin%20Warhaft\"&gt;Talin Warhaft&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;a href=\"Deadlands\"&gt;Deadlands&lt;/a&gt; by &lt;a href=\"Jagar%20Tharn\"&gt;Jagar Tharn&lt;/a&gt;. Tharn planned for months to capture the throne, and he was able to achieve so in the span of ten years. Tharn had a powerful weapon called the &lt;a href=\"Staff%20of%20Chaos\"&gt;Staff of Chaos&lt;/a&gt;, and he split it into nine pieces and scattered them across Tamriel, the staff was the only thing keeping Uriel Septim and Warhaft in &lt;a href=\"Oblivion%20%28Realm%29\"&gt;Oblivion&lt;/a&gt;. A warrior escaped his clutches and traveled all corners of Tamriel to retrieve the missing pieces. The hero was known as the &lt;a href=\"Eternal%20Champion\"&gt;Eternal Champion&lt;/a&gt;, and he assembled the staff and defeated Jagar Tharn at the &lt;a href=\"Imperial%20Palace\"&gt;Imperial Palace&lt;/a&gt;. The Eternal Champion had at one point visited the city of Farrun in their quest to recover the pieces. There were a township in Valenwood called Green Hall."}

The pact dictates Bosmer cannot kill, injure, or eat any vegetation.\nConditions.\nThe known conditions of the Green Pact are as follows:\nPart of the Green Pact is the Meat Mandate, which dictates that a fallen enemy must be eaten completely before three days pass. Another portion of the Green Pact is the tradition of the pact-hostage, which helps to ensure equal treatment in a contract between unequal partners, such as a contract between a mage and a villager. If the more powerful party does not fulfill their end of the bargain, then the pact-hostage will be served to them as Unthrappa, or atonement in &lt;a href=\"Tamrielic\"&gt;Tamrielic&lt;/a&gt;.\nEffect on Bosmer culture.\nThe Green Pact has heavily impacted Bosmeri cuisine, combat, weaponry and construction. The Bosmer have developed methods of fermenting meat and milk to develop powerful &lt;a href=\"Beverages\"&gt;alcoholic beverages&lt;/a&gt;, and their weapons such as bows are often made of treated and shaped bones. Bosmer are also dependent on either stone or imported timber for construction purposes.\nThe Bosmer were religiously carnivorous and cannibalistic as a result of the Green Pact; this has led to changes in approaches to combat, such as fasting and planning family feasts following a battle."}

Greenheart is the home of the &lt;a href=\"Wilderking\"&gt;Wilderking&lt;/a&gt;, a god among the tribal clans of Greenshade. The Wilderking possess to the power to manipulate the land, being said to war with the Valenwood itself.\nDescription.\nGeography.\nGreenheart is situated in the lower coast of Greenshade, between the city-states of &lt;a href=\"Woodhearth\"&gt;Woodhearth&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Marbruk\"&gt;Marbruk&lt;/a&gt;. Greenheart surrounds the &lt;a href=\"Graht-oak\"&gt;Graht-oak&lt;/a&gt; that the Wilderking resides in, descending a hill that eventually goes into the open grasslands of the &lt;a href=\"Wilderking%20Court\"&gt;Wilderking Court&lt;/a&gt;. The ruins of the &lt;a href=\"Labyrinth\"&gt;Labyrinth&lt;/a&gt; are located on the outskirts of Greenheart, as well as the ruined fort of &lt;a href=\"Shadows%20Crawl\"&gt;Shadows Crawl&lt;/a&gt;. Most of the area is riddled with Ayleid Ruins and has a low population, with more people living on the outskirts of Marbruk. On the base of Greenheart grows unique flowers called the &lt;a href=\"Nereid%27s%20Smile\"&gt;Nereid's Smile&lt;/a&gt;, which are special to the Bosmer. The Wood Elves above Greenheart rarely go into the ground floor, and so they are rather careless when throwing their trash out the tree. The &lt;a href=\"Great%20Spiral\"&gt;Great Spiral&lt;/a&gt; refers to the whirling roads that eventually led into the Graht-oak of the Wilderking. Many &lt;a href=\"High%20Elven\"&gt;High Elven&lt;/a&gt; buildings were built in this area, including an Altmer Longhouse. There is no viable entrance to the Throne of the Wilderking, only through tunnels underneath the hill. The Throne overlooks the entire Court of the Wilderking and the Southern Seas.\nHistory.\n&lt;a href=\"First%20Era\"&gt;First Era&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe Tale of Ostion &amp; the Valenwood.\nThe Elves have an affinity with magic, but none have been able to manipulate the land they walk on. A young Altmer mage known as &lt;a href=\"Ostion\"&gt;Ostion&lt;/a&gt; was the first with this ability. Because of his phenomenal talent, Ostion had grown up alone and neglected, but the nobles of the &lt;a href=\"Summerset%20Isles\"&gt;Summerset Isles&lt;/a&gt;, saw his potential for their own benefit. Ostion and a group of workers were sent to Valenwood, to build a city in their visage, as their foothold in the province. But the Valenwood itself denied Ostion from shifting the land. This led to a war of sorts, between Ostion and Valenwood, which led to the two forgetting the people at their side. Ostion forgot the builders, while Valenwood forgot the &lt;a href=\"Wood%20Elves\"&gt;Wood Elves&lt;/a&gt; that took refuge in its forest. Eventually, Ostion and the Valenwood enjoyed their constant struggling, they were lonely but were not alone anymore. But when &lt;a href=\"Sumiril\"&gt;Sumiril&lt;/a&gt;, the only person to care for Ostion was killed amidst the conflict, Ostion asked the land to revive them from the dead. And so, the two worked together and out of it came the city-state of Greenheart, and the race of the &lt;a href=\"Hollow\"&gt;Hollow&lt;/a&gt;, with Sumiril being the first one. Ostion had grown up, and taken the role of the Wilderking.\n&lt;a href=\"Second%20Era\"&gt;Second Era&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe Rock Witch of Silatar; Aranias.\nDuring the &lt;a href=\"Interregnum\"&gt;Interregnum&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"2E%20582\"&gt;2E 582&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"Veiled%20Heritance\"&gt;Veiled Heritance&lt;/a&gt;, a radical group of High Elves from the island of &lt;a href=\"Auridon\"&gt;Auridon&lt;/a&gt; had re-appeared in Greenshade, now under the command of &lt;a href=\"Vicereeve%20Pelidil\"&gt;Vicereeve Pelidil&lt;/a&gt;. The Wilderking, formerly known as Ostion, continued his rule over Greenheart, and the tribal clans of Greenshade had shown the utmost worship of the Wilderking, making him a prime target of the Veiled Heritance. At this point, another earth-mage had appeared, in the form of &lt;a href=\"Aranias\"&gt;Aranias&lt;/a&gt;, who is supposedly the one who created the island of &lt;a href=\"Silatar\"&gt;Silatar&lt;/a&gt;. Aranias was unwillingly coronated into the Veiled Heritance by her parents, who were allies of &lt;a href=\"High%20Kinlady%20Estre\"&gt;High Kinlady Estre&lt;/a&gt;, founder of the Heritance. Aranias, and &lt;a href=\"Andur\"&gt;Andur&lt;/a&gt;, an Altmer Warrior, were tasked with killing the Wilderking. But when the &lt;a href=\"Spinner%20Maruin\"&gt;Spinner Maruin&lt;/a&gt; and an &lt;a href=\"Vestige\"&gt;Agent&lt;/a&gt; of the Dominion, retold her story and showed her, her true destiny. And so, the two worked together to protect Greenheart from Andur, but in the end, Ostion had perished, and Aranias took the role as the &lt;a href=\"Wilderqueen\"&gt;Wilderqueen&lt;/a&gt;, ruling ever since.\n&lt;a href=\"Third%20Era\"&gt;Third Era&lt;/a&gt;.\nGreenheart during the Imperial Simulacrum.\nDuring the &lt;a href=\"Imperial%20Simulacrum\"&gt;Imperial Simulacrum&lt;/a&gt; from &lt;a href=\"3E%20389\"&gt;3E 389&lt;/a&gt; to &lt;a href=\"3E%20399\"&gt;3E 399&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Emperor\"&gt;Emperor&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Uriel%20Septim%20VII\"&gt;Uriel Septim VII&lt;/a&gt; was imprisoned along with &lt;a href=\"Talin%20Warhaft\"&gt;Talin Warhaft&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;a href=\"Deadlands\"&gt;Deadlands&lt;/a&gt; by &lt;a href=\"Jagar%20Tharn\"&gt;Jagar Tharn&lt;/a&gt;. Tharn planned for months to capture the throne, and he was able to achieve so in ten years. Tharn had a powerful weapon called the &lt;a href=\"Staff%20of%20Chaos\"&gt;Staff of Chaos&lt;/a&gt;, and he split it into nine pieces and scattered them across Tamriel, the staff was the only thing keeping Uriel Septim and Warhaft in &lt;a href=\"Oblivion\"&gt;Oblivion&lt;/a&gt;. A warrior escaped his clutches and traveled all corners of Tamriel to retrieve the missing pieces. The hero was known as the &lt;a href=\"Eternal%20Champion\"&gt;Eternal Champion&lt;/a&gt;, and he assembled the staff and defeated Jagar Tharn at the &lt;a href=\"Imperial%20Palace\"&gt;Imperial Palace&lt;/a&gt;. The Eternal Champion had at one point visited the city in their quest to recover the pieces. The city of Greenheart was under the rule of &lt;a href=\"King%20Colas\"&gt;King Colas&lt;/a&gt;."}

It can be useful for growing rare and expensive ingredients, or simply a convenient location to harvest ingredients for &lt;a href=\"Alchemy%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;alchemical&lt;/a&gt; purposes. Like the &lt;a href=\"trophy%20room\"&gt;trophy room&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"kitchen\"&gt;kitchen&lt;/a&gt;, the greenhouse is located on the ground floor and no additions are made to the second floor.\nOnce the structure has been built, the greenhouse offers a wide selection of furnishing options, such as: planters, containers, cupboards, shelving and decorative mounted animal heads. Once certain furnishings have been added, &lt;a href=\"hanging%20moss\"&gt;hanging moss&lt;/a&gt; will appear on the timber beams, as well as: &lt;a href=\"bird%20nests\"&gt;bird nests&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Butterfly%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;butterflies&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Torchbugs%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;torchbugs&lt;/a&gt;, beehives, and &lt;a href=\"bee\"&gt;bee&lt;/a&gt;s. In addition, a beam of sunlight will shine through the windows onto the large planters.\nPlanting.\nItems can be planted by activating a patch of fertile soil and choosing a plant from a list of &lt;a href=\"Food%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;food items&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"Ingredients%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;ingredients&lt;/a&gt; in your inventory. A maximum of 18 patches are available if fully furnished and only one sample is required for each fertile soil patch.\nThe selected plant will soon grow in the garden, and will regrow again after it has been harvested. Harvesting typically yields 4 or 5\u2020 samples of the plant, rather than only one sample that is obtained from plants in the wild.\nThe patch may be cleared at any time by activating the fertile soil again. If a plant is already growing, a message will be displayed that mentions a plant is already growing. The two options from here are \"Do nothing\" or \"Clear planter.\" Choosing to clear the planter will revert the soil back to normal, ready for a new plant.\nThe following is a full list of plants and fungi that can be planted and grown in the soil of the greenhouse or outdoor garden. Note that plants that are endemic to &lt;a href=\"Solstheim%20%28Dragonborn%29\"&gt;Solstheim&lt;/a&gt;, and many of the plants from &lt;a href=\"Skyrim\"&gt;Skyrim&lt;/a&gt;, can not be planted.\nFurnishings.\nThe following is a list of all furnishings that can be added to the greenhouse. Furnishings can be built manually at the indoor &lt;a href=\"Carpenter%27s%20Workbench\"&gt;carpenters' workbench&lt;/a&gt;, or added over a period time if done via a &lt;a href=\"Steward%20%28Hearthfire%29\"&gt;steward&lt;/a&gt;. The cost of asking a steward to furnish the greenhouse is 1500 .\nAll furnishings are fixed in position and cannot be removed once they are built. The name of the furnishing option does not always accurately describe what will be added, as in some cases additional containers and accessories may be added, along with the main piece of furniture.\nFull Totals.\nSpecial Totals.\nThese are the total amount of &lt;a href=\"Septim%20%28Coin%29\"&gt;Septims&lt;/a&gt; and totals are needed in other to get the crafted and bought &lt;a href=\"Housebuilding%20Items\"&gt;Housebuilding Items&lt;/a&gt;."}

Life flourishes beneath the lush canopy of Greenshade's graht-oak forest fed by snaking rivers, vast forests and plentiful resources that have left it greatly untouched by civilization. The capital city of the region is &lt;a href=\"Woodhearth%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Woodhearth&lt;/a&gt; in the west that facilitates trade from the rest of &lt;a href=\"Tamriel\"&gt;Tamriel&lt;/a&gt;.\nBackground.\nGreenshade is the seat of the &lt;a href=\"Wilderking\"&gt;Wilderking&lt;/a&gt; and later the &lt;a href=\"Wilderqueen\"&gt;Wilderqueen&lt;/a&gt;, a &lt;a href=\"Bosmer%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Bosmer&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Deities%20%28Online%29\"&gt;deitiy&lt;/a&gt; whose control over the region is separate from the &lt;a href=\"Aldmeri%20Dominion%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Aldmeri Dominion&lt;/a&gt;. During the &lt;a href=\"Alliance%20War\"&gt;Alliance War&lt;/a&gt;, in order to secure control over the region, the Dominion negotiated an Alliance with the Wilderking.\nGreenshade features a large proportion of Valenwood's tribal Bosmer populations who follow the &lt;a href=\"Green%20Pact\"&gt;Green Pact&lt;/a&gt; and are distrustful of others, including the Dominion. The city of &lt;a href=\"Marbruk%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Marbruk&lt;/a&gt; was constructed by the &lt;a href=\"Altmer%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Altmer&lt;/a&gt; to unify the local population with the culture of the Dominion, although others regard the city's existence as an act of \"civic aggression.\" In earlier times, the merchant thoroughfares of the region consisted of old tunnels that bypassed the dense terrain and dangerous wildlife. Such tunnels then came into almost exclusive use by black market traders. Local Bosmer are also known to thieve on traveling merchants.\nLocations.\nThe following are locations accessible in Greenshade and, with the exception of &lt;a href=\"Unmarked%20Locations%20%28Online%29\"&gt;unmarked locations&lt;/a&gt;, are discoverable on the map. Points of Interest serve as locations with unique side quests, while &lt;a href=\"Cities%20%28Online%29\"&gt;cities&lt;/a&gt; serve as the centralized areas with multiple sublocations and act as a hub for services and &lt;a href=\"Merchants%20%28Online%29\"&gt;merchants&lt;/a&gt;. Explanations of the types of locations are provided in the &lt;a href=\"Locations%20%28Online%29%23Types\"&gt;main locations page&lt;/a&gt;.\nQuests.\nGreenshade features a series of zone story quests and unrelated side quests. The zone story quests tie into the Aldmeri Dominion's overarching storyline and carries on from &lt;a href=\"Grahtwood\"&gt;Grahtwood&lt;/a&gt; before continuing to &lt;a href=\"Malabal%20Tor\"&gt;Malabal Tor&lt;/a&gt;, but it is not necessary to complete the story quests for zones prior to those in Greenshade. Side quests are non-sequential and can be completed in any order, except where one carries on from another, and &lt;a href=\"repeatable%20quests\"&gt;repeatable quests&lt;/a&gt; can be completed multiple times: weekly for arenas and trials and daily for all others. Pointer quests are optional zone quests that send the Vestige to the tarting location of another zone quest.\nItem sets.\nItem sets are related armor and weapons that, when worn together, provide unique benefits. Overland sets can be acquired from world bosses, world events, delves, public dungeons and containers and as quest rewards; dungeon sets can be acquired from within group dungeons; monster sets can be acquired from the final boss of veteran group dungeons and Undaunted Enclaves; and crafted sets can be created at specific locations across the zone.\nSkyshards.\nSixteen Skyshards can be found in Greenshade totaling in five &lt;a href=\"skill%20points\"&gt;skill points&lt;/a&gt; with one left over. The zone guide provides clues as to the location of each Skyshard, but many can be found simply by exploring and watching for the distinctive pillar of light they emit. Skyshards will appear on the map and compass when the Vestige is close to one and will remain discovered on the map even if it was not collected.\nAchievements.\nAchievements can be earned by completing specific tasks such as completing quests and discovering locations. Achievements are separated into categories and their progress is viewable from the journal. Earning achievement provides the Vestige a number of points, and some achievements unlock unique rewards such as &lt;a href=\"Furnishings%20%28Online%29\"&gt;furnishings&lt;/a&gt; that can be bought from Achievement Furnishers or &lt;a href=\"collectibles\"&gt;collectibles&lt;/a&gt;.\nShalidor's Library.\nThirty-two books that are a part of Shalidor's Library can be found in Greenshade and added to the collection. Books that have already been found in other zones will already be marked as completed in the zone tracker.\nFish.\nFish can be caught from fishing hotspots, ideally with the correct &lt;a href=\"bait\"&gt;bait&lt;/a&gt;. Common fish will be caught most often while rare fish and alternative bait are rare catches. Each zone has unique rare fish than can be caught from hotspots. &lt;a href=\"Slaughterfish%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Slaughterfish&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"trodh\"&gt;trodh&lt;/a&gt; can be caught from foul hotspots, &lt;a href=\"dhufish\"&gt;dhufish&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"longfin\"&gt;longfin&lt;/a&gt; can be caught from saltwater hotspots, &lt;a href=\"silverside%20perch\"&gt;silverside perch&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"spadetail\"&gt;spadetail&lt;/a&gt; can be caught from lake hotspots, and &lt;a href=\"Salmon%20%28Online%29\"&gt;salmon&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"River%20Betty%20%28Online%29\"&gt;river betty&lt;/a&gt; can be caught from river hotspots. &lt;a href=\"Chub\"&gt;Chub&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"minnow\"&gt;minnow&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"shad\"&gt;shad&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"fish%20roe\"&gt;fish roe&lt;/a&gt; can be caught and used as bait from foul, saltwater, lake and river hotspots, respectively."}

It serves as a military stronghold in the Rift.\nDescription.\nGeography.\nGreenwall is situated in a pass between the &lt;a href=\"Stony%20Basin\"&gt;Stony Basin&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Smokefrost%20Peaks\"&gt;Smokefrost Peaks&lt;/a&gt;, it serves as a gateway to the towns of &lt;a href=\"Shor%27s%20Stone\"&gt;Shor's Stone&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Riften\"&gt;Riften&lt;/a&gt;. Greenwall is built rectangularly, and it has a large wall that extends to the &lt;a href=\"Velothi%20Mountains\"&gt;Velothi Mountains&lt;/a&gt; to further protect Riften, this wall was torn down by the fourth era. Greenwall has a large courtyard with the Keep on the western wall and a blacksmith forge on the eastern end. Greenwall has extensive ruins built underground that date back to the &lt;a href=\"Merethic%20Era\"&gt;Merethic Era&lt;/a&gt;. The only way to bypass Greenwall is to go around the &lt;a href=\"Ragged%20Hills\"&gt;Ragged Hills&lt;/a&gt; in the western Rift.\nHistory.\nEarly years.\nWhen Fort Greenwall was constructed, the &lt;a href=\"Nord\"&gt;Nord&lt;/a&gt;ic excavators constructed halls underneath the fort and discovered ancient &lt;a href=\"Snow%20Elf\"&gt;Snow Elven&lt;/a&gt; ruins in the southern halls of Greenwall. The ruins dated back to the &lt;a href=\"Nordic-Falmer%20War\"&gt;Nordic-Falmer War&lt;/a&gt; when &lt;a href=\"The%20Companions\"&gt;The Companions&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"Fallowstone%20Hall\"&gt;Fallowstone Hall&lt;/a&gt; purged the Rift of any Snow Elven settlements from &lt;a href=\"Lake%20Geir\"&gt;Lake Geir&lt;/a&gt; to &lt;a href=\"Lake%20Honrich\"&gt;Lake Honrich&lt;/a&gt;. The fort then became property of Riften and served as the military stronghold that governs the Rift.\n&lt;a href=\"Second%20Era\"&gt;Second Era&lt;/a&gt;.\nFort Greenwall was used during the &lt;a href=\"Second%20Akaviri%20Invasion\"&gt;Second Akaviri Invasion&lt;/a&gt; as a defense against the incoming hordes of &lt;a href=\"Kamal\"&gt;Kamal&lt;/a&gt; led by &lt;a href=\"Ada%27Soom%20Dir-Kamal\"&gt;Ada'Soom Dir-Kamal&lt;/a&gt;. After destroying the city of &lt;a href=\"Windhelm\"&gt;Windhelm&lt;/a&gt;, the Kamal Hordes moved southwards to Fort Greenwall and battled the Nords to stationed there. Greenwall was sacked by the Snow Demons, and they moved to the city of Riften, where they avoided it and advanced to &lt;a href=\"Stonefalls\"&gt;Stonefalls&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Morrowind\"&gt;Morrowind&lt;/a&gt; instead. It was here where they were defeated at the &lt;a href=\"Battle%20of%20Stonefalls\"&gt;Battle of Stonefalls&lt;/a&gt;. The fort was abandoned afterward, and no one used the bulwark since.\nDuring the &lt;a href=\"Interregnum\"&gt;Interregnum&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"2E%20582\"&gt;2E 582&lt;/a&gt;, a group of bandits led by &lt;a href=\"Uggurek%20the%20Vile\"&gt;Uggurek the Vile&lt;/a&gt; inhabited the fort and used it as a base to pillage nearby settlements in the Stony Basin and the Smokefrost Peaks. As a way to counter this, the &lt;a href=\"Thane%20%28Title%29\"&gt;Thane&lt;/a&gt; of Riften had a large box of cursed wine be sent in the Greenwall road, this was bait for the bandits. The bandits drank the wine and were eventually cleared out. It was unknown whether the fort was re-established by the Court of Riften or if new bandits inhabited later on.\n&lt;a href=\"Third%20Era\"&gt;Third Era&lt;/a&gt;.\nDuring the &lt;a href=\"Imperial%20Simulacrum\"&gt;Imperial Simulacrum&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"3E%20399\"&gt;3E 399&lt;/a&gt;, the Greenwall township existed in Skyrim in between the towns of &lt;a href=\"Riften\"&gt;Riften&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Sungard\"&gt;Sunguard&lt;/a&gt;. At one point, the &lt;a href=\"Eternal%20Champion\"&gt;Eternal Champion&lt;/a&gt; had visited the town in their quest for a piece of the &lt;a href=\"Staff%20of%20Chaos\"&gt;Staff of Chaos&lt;/a&gt; to defeat &lt;a href=\"Jagar%20Tharn\"&gt;Jagar Tharn&lt;/a&gt; at the &lt;a href=\"Imperial%20Palace\"&gt;Imperial Palace&lt;/a&gt;.\n&lt;a href=\"Fourth%20Era\"&gt;Fourth Era&lt;/a&gt;.\nFort Greenwall was a major military bulwark that protected the city of &lt;a href=\"Riften\"&gt;Riften&lt;/a&gt; from foreign invaders from the north. Those who took control of Greenwall had control over Riften and the entire Rift. At this point, the fort was overrun by a group of local bandits who used it as a redoubt. Because Riften joined &lt;a href=\"Ulfric%20Stormcloak%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Ulfric Stormcloak&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"Windhelm\"&gt;Windhelm&lt;/a&gt;, the stronghold is under the control of the &lt;a href=\"Stormcloaks\"&gt;Stormcloaks&lt;/a&gt;."}

I can't go on living this lie. What I mean to say is, I know about you and &lt;a href=\"Ademar\"&gt;Ademar&lt;/a&gt;. I saw you, three months ago, kiss and exchange a look that meant much more than a kiss. That was the moment suspicion and faith gave way to truth and betrayal.\nI won't ask you how you could do it. But I won't remain in a marriage that's not worthy of the name.\nStill, I've not given up on you or on us. I still hope that we may be reconciled.\nIf that hope is not in vain, I pray you'll respond to this letter by meeting me at the entrance to the &lt;a href=\"Buried%20Sands\"&gt;Buried Sands&lt;/a&gt; at the very hour when we first met, all those many years ago.\nI think you remember. It had rained most of the day, and then the clouds broke and the sun came out, lighting up your golden hair. I took it as a sign and finally worked up the courage to speak to you.\nAnd now we find ourselves in this untenable situation.\nI hope my faith in you is not misplaced,\n&lt;a href=\"Phillip\"&gt;Phillip&lt;/a&gt;"}
