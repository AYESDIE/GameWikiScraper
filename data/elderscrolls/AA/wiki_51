Jorunn had great talent as a singer and studied the art on &lt;a href=\"Skald%27s%20Retreat\"&gt;Skald's Retreat&lt;/a&gt; on the &lt;a href=\"Isle%20of%20Gold\"&gt;Isle of Gold&lt;/a&gt; near &lt;a href=\"Riften%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Riften&lt;/a&gt;. He learned from the most renowned bards in the &lt;a href=\"Eastern%20Skyrim\"&gt;Eastern lands&lt;/a&gt; and was dubbed \"The Skald-Prince\" of &lt;a href=\"Skyrim%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Skyrim&lt;/a&gt;.\nJorunn spent most of his young life in artistic and philosophical pursuits. He spent time in &lt;a href=\"Mournhold%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Mournhold&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Morrowind%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Morrowind&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Stormhold%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Stormhold&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Black%20Marsh%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Black Marsh&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Sutch\"&gt;Sutch&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Cyrodiil%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Cyrodiil&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Elinhir%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Elinhir&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Hammerfell%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Hammerfell&lt;/a&gt;. It is also rumored that he visited &lt;a href=\"Solitude\"&gt;Solitude&lt;/a&gt;, the capital of &lt;a href=\"Western%20Skyrim\"&gt;Western Skyrim&lt;/a&gt;, in disguise. Despite claiming that he had no interest in leadership and politics, the young Nord found himself becoming the leader of whatever creative community he found himself in. He received little training in the martial arts, but learned less orthodox ways of defending himself in his travels across &lt;a href=\"Tamriel\"&gt;Tamriel&lt;/a&gt;.\nSack of Windhelm.\nIn 2E 572, Jorunn was in Riften when the &lt;a href=\"Akaviri\"&gt;Akaviri&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"Dir-Kamal\"&gt;Dir-Kamal&lt;/a&gt; attacked the northeastern coast of Skyrim. Meanwhile, Nurnhilde and Fildgor, along with his loyal companions &lt;a href=\"Stormfist%20Clan\"&gt;Stormfist Clan&lt;/a&gt;, were already in battle with the Akaviri to defend the coast. Jorunn fought his way up along the Eastern coast to Windhelm with the aid of his own closest companions, the &lt;a href=\"Pack%20of%20Bards\"&gt;Pack of Bards&lt;/a&gt;. Jorunn, Fildgor, and their groups arrived just as the Akaviri breached the city gates. Despite their combined efforts, they could not stop the fall of Windhelm, nor prevent the deaths of Queen Mabjaarn and Princess Nurnhilde.\nWounded and devastated by the loss of his family, Jorunn felt the responsibility of his royal birth for the first time. He decided to appeal to the &lt;a href=\"Greybeards\"&gt;Greybeards&lt;/a&gt; and made his way to &lt;a href=\"High%20Hrothgar\"&gt;High Hrothgar&lt;/a&gt;. For unknown reasons, the Greybeards decided to forgo their doctrine of passivity and aided Jorunn by summoning a hero from &lt;a href=\"Sovngarde%20%28Location%29\"&gt;Sovngarde&lt;/a&gt;; &lt;a href=\"Wulfharth%20the%20Ash-King\"&gt;Wulfharth the Ash-King&lt;/a&gt;.\u00a0\nThe Skald-King and the Ash-King.\nJorunn claimed the title of Skald-King and, with the aid of Wulfharth, rallied his fellow Nords of &lt;a href=\"Eastern%20Skyrim\"&gt;Eastern Skyrim&lt;/a&gt; to raise an army from the Rift and Eastmarch before fortifying Riften. As the Akaviri marched south from Windhelm, they found Riften's defense by the Nords too powerful, as the Nords were inspired by the presence of Wulfharth and were eager to fight. Dir-Kamal decided these Nords were too great an enemy and turned his army east into &lt;a href=\"Morrowind%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Morrowind&lt;/a&gt; towards &lt;a href=\"Mournhold%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Mournhold&lt;/a&gt;, assuming the Nords would not pursue.\nThis proved a fatal error, as Jorunn led his army after the Akaviri into Morrowind. For the first time since the &lt;a href=\"Battle%20of%20Red%20Mountain\"&gt;Battle of Red Mountain&lt;/a&gt;, a Nord army entered Morrowind. Dir-Kamal's army was trapped at &lt;a href=\"Stonefalls%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Stonefalls&lt;/a&gt; and engaged in battle by Jorunn's Nords, as well as an army of &lt;a href=\"Dunmer%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Dunmer&lt;/a&gt; led by the &lt;a href=\"Tribunal%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Tribunal&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Almalexia%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Almalexia&lt;/a&gt;. The battle was undecided until a fourth army arrived on the field: a force of &lt;a href=\"Argonians%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Argonian&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"shellbacks\"&gt;shellbacks&lt;/a&gt; led by a trio of Argonian battlemages. The Akaviri army was routed and drowned by the thousands as they were driven into the sea.\u00a0\nThe High King of Skyrim.\nThe Ash-King, having fulfilled his promise, returned to Sovngarde. Jorunn was crowned High-King of Skyrim three weeks later at the Palace of the Kings in Windhelm, though not without contention. His twin brother &lt;a href=\"Fildgor%20Orcthane\"&gt;Fildgor Strong-Prince&lt;/a&gt; sought to take the throne by force. Jorunn succeeded in exiling his brother, ushering in an era of peace and diplomacy across Skyrim and the newly formed &lt;a href=\"Ebonheart%20Pact\"&gt;Ebonheart Pact&lt;/a&gt;. Jorunn also had a son, &lt;a href=\"Prince%20Irnskar\"&gt;Prince Irnskar&lt;/a&gt;.\nJorunn\u00a0was later appointed acting &lt;a href=\"High%20King\"&gt;High King&lt;/a&gt; after the &lt;a href=\"Great%20Moot\"&gt;Great Moot&lt;/a&gt;, a unique form of government in which decisions must be ratified by all composite parties. He rules from the ancient city of &lt;a href=\"Windhelm%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Windhelm&lt;/a&gt;.\nThree Banners War.\nThe Konunleikar.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Vestige\"&gt;Vestige&lt;/a&gt; encountered the Skald-King in Windhelm after arriving by the docks, holding council during the celebrations in a makeshift cottage in the city alongside Pact delegates and his son Irnskar. The Vestige participated in the &lt;a href=\"Konunleikar\"&gt;Konunleikar&lt;/a&gt; festivities and helped uncover a plot by the Stormfist Brigade, stopping them from assassinating Jorunn in the Hall of Trials during the festival's finale.\nWith danger presenting itself and with the Palace of Windhelm still under construction, the king decided to hold a secret Moot with the rest of the Pact leaders at various locations in Eastmarch, with &lt;a href=\"Skuldafn%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Skuldafn&lt;/a&gt; as the planned destination for the council.\nKing Jorunn, the Pact leaders and their respective retinue first moved to &lt;a href=\"Fort%20Amol%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Fort Amol&lt;/a&gt; with the Pact delegates as the council continues. While within &lt;a href=\"Jarl%20Ivannar\"&gt;Jarl Ivannar&lt;/a&gt;'s keep, he was poisoned by Stormfist\u00a0assassins and was almost replaced and killed by a &lt;a href=\"Bretons%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Breton&lt;/a&gt; assassin named &lt;a href=\"Dhalen\"&gt;Dhalen&lt;/a&gt;, until the Vestige and the &lt;a href=\"Morag%20Tong\"&gt;Morag Tong&lt;/a&gt; assassin &lt;a href=\"Naryu%20Virian%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Naryu Virian&lt;/a&gt; arrived and foiled the assassination attempt by the Stormfists.\nEternal Slumber.\nDhalen had poisoned Jorunn with a &lt;a href=\"Daedric\"&gt;Daedric&lt;/a&gt; poison, and the King soon fell into a coma. The Vestige was able to procure items to prolong his life until he could be brought to the Ternion Monks at Mistwatch. There, an &lt;a href=\"Argonians%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Argonian&lt;/a&gt; Dreamwalker attempted to enter the King's mind to save him. He failed, and the Vestige entered after him. They were able to defeat the nightmares and free him from the poison's influence.\nQueen Nurnhilde's spirit appeared to Jorunn and told him of their brother Fildgor's plan: he intended to enter Sovngarde to be able to wear the Crown of Freydis, after which he would be the undisputed King of Skyrim. For this, Fildgor had moved his forces to Skuldafn.\nAssault on Skuldafn.\nJorunn and the Moot marched on Skuldafn with a Pact army, but met heavy resistance from the Stormfists. Pact scouts were able to locate a hidden passage through the mountains that bypassed the Stormfist lines. Jorunn dispatched Mera Stormcloak and a small contigent of Pact warriors through the passage, along with the Vestige. Once at the Stormfist camp, they set the supplies and weapons on fire. With the Stormfists in chaos, the Pact broke through their lines.\nThe Vestige entered the portal to Sovngarde to find Fildgor performing a ritual to force the Crown of Freydis to acknowledge him. The Vestige fought and defeated him, then brought him out to face his brother. The Vestige then had to choose between killing Fildgor, letting Jorunn kill him, or sparing his life.\u00a0\nThe Moot then convened, presenting their objects of power.\nInvasion of the Rift.\nShortly after, Reachmen invaded the Rift. Jorunn and the Moot immediately lead the Pact forces south. The Companions had already engaged the invaders at Fallowstone Hall. They stole the axe &lt;a href=\"Wuuthrad%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Wuuthrad&lt;/a&gt; from the crypts and headed west. The Reachmen were under orders from the Worm Cult, lead by a Nord necromancer named &lt;a href=\"Thallik%20Wormfather\"&gt;Thallik Wormfather&lt;/a&gt;. They shattered the axe and used its fragments to revive Sinmur, an undead giant who had been slain by Ysgramor.\nSinmur then fused his essence with Thallik and attacked Riften, killing many before heading into the mountains to the Daedric ruins of Trollhetta. There the last of the Worm Cult was besieged by Pact forces led by Jorunn. The Vestige was able to gather the fragments of Wuuthrad and use them to weaken Sinmur sufficiently to be slain. After the battle, ghosts of the Five Hundred and Ysgramor himself congratulated Jorunn on his victory.\nMeeting at Stirk.\n&lt;a href=\"Vanus%20Galerion%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Vanus Galerion&lt;/a&gt; and the Vestige were able to convince all three alliance leaders to meet on the island of Stirk of the coast of &lt;a href=\"Cyrodiil%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Cyrodiil&lt;/a&gt; to plan an invasion of &lt;a href=\"Coldharbour%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Coldharbour&lt;/a&gt;. Negotiations quickly broke down as the three leaders began arguing with each other. Vanus and countess Hakruba of the Fighters Guild realized the leaders would never agree to sending forces into Coldharbour for fear the others would use the opportunity to seize the &lt;a href=\"Imperial%20City\"&gt;Imperial City&lt;/a&gt;. They asked the Vestige to convince the three leaders to allow the Fighters and Mages Guild to go into Coldharbour instead. Before the negotiations could resume, Molag Bal opened Daedric portals on the island and his minions attacked. After being defeated, the three leaders realised the Guilds going in would be their best plan, and each gave their blessing.\nPersonality.\nJorunn was said to be down-to-earth, to have a sense of humor and an \"iron will to succeed.\" While his brother Fildgor preferred force and power, Jorunn preferred peace and democracy, a trait which helped him keep the Pact from falling apart. While his childhood pranks and way with words as a skald has often garnered him women and admiration in the past, he now uses it to keep a volatile alliance together.\nHe deeply cared for his sister Nurnhilde, and she often took care of him as well, such as the time when Jorunn almost died from frost inside a cave. He is considered the weakest of his siblings especially when compared to Fildgor, but makes up for it with his diplomatic acumen and kind heart.\nConsidered a rare breed of ruler, he is said to be a king who listens to his people.\nInteractions.\nEbonheart Pact Quests.\n&lt;a href=\"One%20Victor%2C%20One%20King\"&gt;One Victor, One King&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe Vestige is sent by Thane Mera Stormcloak to the Hall of Trials to protect King Jorunn.\n&lt;a href=\"A%20Council%20of%20Thanes\"&gt;A Council of Thanes&lt;/a&gt;.\nConvince the Thanes of Eastmarch to attend Jorunn's war council as they march against the Stormfists.\nColdharbor Quests.\n&lt;a href=\"Messages%20Across%20Tamriel\"&gt;Messages Across Tamriel&lt;/a&gt;.\nGet the leaders to agree to a summit.\n&lt;a href=\"The%20Weight%20of%20Three%20Crowns\"&gt;The Weight of Three Crowns&lt;/a&gt;.\nAttend the summit and devise a plan for attacking Coldharbour.\nConversations.\n&lt;a href=\"Stomping%20Sinmur\"&gt;Stomping Sinmur&lt;/a&gt;.\nJorunn the Skald-King: \"Kyne's Breath. Can it be? The Five Hundred Companions?\"\nYsgramor: \"Sinmur is dead. You have won a great victory this day!\"\nJorunn the Skald-King: \"I had help, my liege.\"\nYsgramor: \"Your champions! We've met. A hard road lies ahead of you. But for now, savor this victory.\"\nJorunn the Skald-King: \"Thank you, Ysgramor!\"\nYsgramor: \"Companions! Three cheers for the Skald King and his brave champions! Wormcrushers and giantslayers!\"\n\"Again!\"\n\"Once More!\"\n\"For the Pact and the north!\"\n\"Companions!

A clever plan to divert our forces while your armies take the Imperial City?\"\nJorunn the Skald-King: \"I thought backstabbing was your favorite tactic, Emeric!\"\nQueen Ayrenn: \"Please! Are you both so arrogant? Your weapons are children's toys compared to the horrors that Molag Bal commands!\"\nHigh King Emeric: \"I will not wager the future of my people on the word of a snow barbarian and an adolescent female. I fear for Tamriel's future if either of you were to sit upon the Ruby Throne!\"\nJorunn the Skald-King: \"Since when do you care about your people? You never lift a finger except to count your gold!\"\nVanus Galerion: \"Please, my lords! This bickering is pointless!\"\nJorunn the Skald-King: \"What a waste of time.\"\nQueen Ayrenn: \"Obstinate fools, both of you!\"\nHigh King Emeric: \"What a mess. Apologies, Vanus, but I'm going to check on my Lion Guard.\"\nAfter Molag Bal's attack: \nVanus Galerion: \"Honored leaders! You have seen the face of our enemy!\"\n\"Molag Bal threatens every living being in Tamriel! The Mages Guild and the Fighters Guild have agreed to join forces to launch an assault on Coldharbour!\"\nCountess Hakruba: \"Trust in us! Sanction our actions! Give us your blessings! We will not let you down!\"\nHigh King Emeric: \"Vanus is right. The Guilds are our best and only choice. Send them to Coldharbour!\"\nJorunn the Skald-King: \"I hate to admit it, but I agree with Emeric.\"\nQueen Ayrenn: \"As do I. It appears that much of the distrust between our alliances was sown and nurtured by the God of Schemes.\"\nCountess Hakruba: \"Molag Bal thrives on deception and chaos, but if you'll forgive me, this Alliance War is of your own making.\"\nVanus Galerion: \"Countess Hakruba. Gather the surviving members of both Guilds in the \u00ab1\u00bb.

A singer of rare talent in a culture that reveres the power of the human voice, Jorunn studied at &lt;a href=\"Skald%27s%20Retreat\"&gt;Skald's Retreat&lt;/a&gt; on the &lt;a href=\"Isle%20of%20Gold\"&gt;Isle of Gold&lt;/a&gt; outside &lt;a href=\"Riften%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Riften&lt;/a&gt;. There he learned all that could be taught by the most renowned bards of the Eastern Kingdom. He was dubbed the \"Skald Prince\" of &lt;a href=\"Skyrim%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Skyrim&lt;/a&gt;.\nJorunn spent most of his youth in artistic and philosophical pursuits, cultivating a broad array of artists, artisans, and performers throughout &lt;a href=\"Eastern%20Skyrim\"&gt;Eastern Skyrim&lt;/a&gt; and beyond. He spent time in &lt;a href=\"Mournhold%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Mournhold&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Stormhold%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Stormhold&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Sutch\"&gt;Sutch&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Elinhir%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Elinhir&lt;/a&gt;, and is even reputed to have visited &lt;a href=\"Solitude\"&gt;Solitude&lt;/a&gt;,\u00a0the capital of &lt;a href=\"Western%20Skyrim\"&gt;Western Skyrim&lt;/a&gt;, in disguise. Though he claimed to have no interest in politics or the business of rule, his natural leadership qualities made him the unofficial leader of the creative community wherever he found himself. Though he received little formal schooling in the arts of arms and warfare \u2013 as little as a prince of the &lt;a href=\"Nords%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Nords&lt;/a&gt; could manage, anyway \u2013 traveling across &lt;a href=\"Tamriel\"&gt;Tamriel&lt;/a&gt; was always a dangerous activity. His travels taught him less orthodox ways of dealing with trouble.\nJorunn was in Riften when the &lt;a href=\"Akaviri\"&gt;Akaviri&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"Dir-Kamal\"&gt;Dir-Kamal&lt;/a&gt; assaulted the northeast coast of Skyrim in &lt;a href=\"2E%20572\"&gt;2E 572&lt;/a&gt;. Jorunn and his closest comrades, the \"Pack of Bards,\" fought their way up the coast to &lt;a href=\"Windhelm%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Windhelm&lt;/a&gt;, arriving just in time to see its gates breached by the Akaviri.\nJorunn hurled himself into the fray, street-fighting being something he had experience with, but was unable to prevent the fall of the city and the slaying of Queen Mabjaarn and , who both went down fighting.\nWounded and devastated, Jorunn barely escaped the sack of Windhelm alive. Feeling for the first time the responsibility of his royal birth, he decided to appeal to the Greybeards for aid, and so made his way, stealthily but quickly, to &lt;a href=\"High%20Hrothgar\"&gt;High Hrothgar&lt;/a&gt;. For reasons that have not been divulged, &lt;a href=\"the%20Greybeards\"&gt;the Greybeards&lt;/a&gt; \nTogether Wulfharth and Jorunn, now claiming the title Skald King, rallied the Nords of Eastern Skyrim, mustering an army from the Rift and the outer regions of Eastmarch, then fortifying Riften. Dir-Kamal, moving south from Windhelm, found Riften defended by angry Nords inspired by the presence of Wulfharth and eager to fight. So Dir-Kamal bypassed Riften and marched on Mournhold, the Akaviri leader assuming that the Nords would be glad to see him go.\nThat choice was a fatal mistake. Jorunn and Wulfharth led their army in pursuit of the Akaviri force, and a Nordic army entered &lt;a href=\"Morrowind%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Morrowind&lt;/a&gt; for the first time since the Battle of Red Mountain. The Akaviri army was caught at &lt;a href=\"Stonefalls%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Stonefalls&lt;/a&gt; between the Nords and a &lt;a href=\"Dunmer%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Dunmer&lt;/a&gt; legion led by &lt;a href=\"Almalexia%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Almalexia&lt;/a&gt;, but the outcome of the great battle hung in the balance -- until a surprise intervention from a phalanx of &lt;a href=\"Argonians%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Argonian&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"shellbacks\"&gt;shellbacks&lt;/a&gt;, led by a trio of reptilian &lt;a href=\"battlemage\"&gt;battlemage&lt;/a&gt;s. The Akaviri line was broken and they were driven into the sea, where they drowned by the thousands.\nThe Ash King, his purpose fulfilled, returned to Sovngarde. In Windhelm, three weeks later, Jorunn was crowned &lt;a href=\"High%20King\"&gt;High King&lt;/a&gt; in the throne room of the &lt;a href=\"Palace%20of%20Kings\"&gt;Palace of Kings&lt;/a&gt;."}

Among them, &lt;a href=\"Felhorn\"&gt;Felhorn&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Sanarel%20the%20Great\"&gt;Sanarel the Great&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Aleris%20the%20Shroud\"&gt;Aleris the Shroud&lt;/a&gt; are known for their formidable combat prowess and fighting spirit. But others, like Josef the Intolerant, have become famous for other reasons.\nLet me first say that the Blessed Crucible of &lt;a href=\"Skyrim%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Skyrim&lt;/a&gt; features an amazing array of competitors, with combatants arriving from all over &lt;a href=\"Tamriel\"&gt;Tamriel&lt;/a&gt; to test their mettle. In this time of warring alliances, it's not just anywhere that an &lt;a href=\"Altmer%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Altmer&lt;/a&gt; would drag a wounded &lt;a href=\"Orsimer%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Orc&lt;/a&gt; to safety, or where a &lt;a href=\"Redguards%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Redguard&lt;/a&gt; would so readily step into an arrow's path for an &lt;a href=\"Argonians%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Argonian&lt;/a&gt;, but the Blessed Crucible is one such place. In the Crucible, one's team is one's nation, and the struggle for the &lt;a href=\"Brimstone%20Crown\"&gt;Brimstone Crown&lt;/a&gt; the national religion.\nHowever, there was one man, a young gladiator named Josef. He came from the &lt;a href=\"Bretons%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Breton&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Lion%20Guard\"&gt;Lion Guard&lt;/a&gt;, and was fresh-faced, decent with a blade. None questioned that he was a healthy boy, ready to take the Crucible by storm. But Josef could never understand the social phenomenon of the Crucible, and trusted only other Bretons. He could not fathom the fact that gladiators must place their trust in their teams, not in gladiators of the same &lt;a href=\"Races%20%28Online%29\"&gt;race&lt;/a&gt;.\nSaid gladiator &lt;a href=\"Oberelle\"&gt;Oberelle&lt;/a&gt;, \"Our match began, and this Breton boy sent his &lt;a href=\"Khajiit%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Khajiiti&lt;/a&gt; team member sprawling to the ground. Then he looked me in the eye and blinked twice, slowly. 'Is he trying to wink?' whispered my ally, &lt;a href=\"Doumant\"&gt;Doumant&lt;/a&gt;. We capitalized on their folly and beat the boy and the Khajiit unconscious. One must never refuse such strokes of fortune in the Blessed Crucible.\"\nAs time passed, young Josef grew increasingly frustrated. He scoffed at suggestions to collaborate with gladiators of other races. His demeanor incensed the Crucible audience along with its competitors, and management loved him for it. \"We would print Josef's face on currency if we could. He is a boon to us,\" they said.\nThe gladiators felt differently.\nSaid &lt;a href=\"Dalu\"&gt;Dalu&lt;/a&gt; the &lt;a href=\"Dunmer%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Dunmeri&lt;/a&gt; Blade, \"Josef told me he would never collaborate with a &lt;a href=\"kwama%20%28Online%29\"&gt;kwama&lt;/a&gt; farmer. And he hounded me every day for kwama eggs. He was certain that I had some, or could, by some miracle, produce them. I have never even tasted a &lt;a href=\"Kwama%20Egg\"&gt;kwama egg&lt;/a&gt;. I was born in Skyrim.\"\nSaid &lt;a href=\"Ethenen\"&gt;Ethenen&lt;/a&gt;, the Rabid Dunmer, \"Josef repeatedly referred to me as Dalu.\"\nSaid &lt;a href=\"Azrukana\"&gt;Azrukana&lt;/a&gt;, the Crimson Cat, \"I told him he could trust me in battle. That he needed to, if he wanted to live for much longer as a gladiator. He rasped his voice and said, 'This one thinks you should have some &lt;a href=\"Moon%20Sugar%20%28Online%29\"&gt;moon sugar&lt;/a&gt; and keep your opinions to yourself.' I did not like that.\"\nSaid &lt;a href=\"Inarfar\"&gt;Inarfar&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"Skyforge\"&gt;Skyforge&lt;/a&gt;d Razor, \"When &lt;a href=\"Hrasvard\"&gt;Hrasvard&lt;/a&gt;, my comrade of a decade, was slain in combat, I went to the &lt;a href=\"Hall%20of%20Champions\"&gt;Hall of Champions&lt;/a&gt; and I wept. That Breton boy found me and said, 'Did you run out of mead-coin? I know how that feels, but unlike you &lt;a href=\"Nords%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Nords&lt;/a&gt;, I wouldn't cry about it.' The beating that ensued in Hrasvard's honor lasted eight minutes.\"\nNo gladiator had gained as much infamy as Josef in so short a time, but he soon disappeared.\nHis current whereabouts are unknown."}

When Rorik was seriously wounded by an &lt;a href=\"Third%20Aldmeri%20Dominion\"&gt;Aldmeri&lt;/a&gt; soldier, Jouane saved his life.\nAfter the war, Rorik went back to the settlement of Rorikstead which he owned. When Jouane is asked how he came to Rorikstead, he will say \"We were as close as kinsmen, and when Rorik returned home I came with him. I am happy to spend my twilight years here with my good friend.\"\nHe also teaches &lt;a href=\"Sissel\"&gt;Sissel&lt;/a&gt;, as she says, \"Someday soon I'll stop being afraid.

He owns these lands, and it's from him that our village gets its name. We have been friends for many years now. Rorik fought for the Empire in the Great War. He was gravely wounded, and so was brought before me. I was a healer then, you see. We were as close as kinsmen, and when Rorik returned home I came with him. I am happy to spend my twilight years here with my good friend.\"\nYour farms are thriving, even despite the harsh climate. What's your secret? \"Secret? What makes you think there's a secret? There are no secrets here, my curious friend. Our prosperity is simply the result of hard work, good fortune and the blessings of the gods.\"\nHow will you protect yourselves against the dragons? \"How can we? We're a community of farmers, not fighting men. If not for the war, we might have enough guards in the hold to protect the settlements. That the dragons should return now is most unfortunate.\"\nConversations.\nSissel and Jouane.\nSissel: \"Jouane?\"\nJouane: \"Yes, child?\"\nSissel: \"I was just wondering. The next time we meet, do you think maybe you could teach me some fire magic? Nothing dangerous! Maybe a candle lighting spell?\"\nJouane: \"By the Eight, keep your voice down! Do you want the entire village to learn our secrets?\"\nSissel: \"Oh! I'm... I'm sorry. I didn't mean to upset you.\"\nJouane: \"Shh shh. It's fine, child. It's fine. But we must be cautious, hmm? What we do, the things I teach you. The others wouldn't understand.\"\nSissel: \"I understand. I'm sorry. I just get so excited thinking about it. So... can we. Do some fire magic?\"\nJouane: \"Hmph. Most certainly not. But perhaps I can teach you how to put some candles out. We'll start there.\"\nSissel: \"Oooh, wonderful! I can't wait!\"\nWaterbreathing.\nJouane: \"Today I'll teach you a useful spell that might just save your life. If you should ever fall into a river, you'll be very glad you learned it.\"\nSissel: \"Oh! Are you going to teach me how to turn into a mud crab?\"\nJouane: \"Oh, it's much better than that. I will teach you how to breathe underwater, with no need to turn into one of those ugly creatures.\"\nSissel: \"Wow! Then I could dive into a river and swim so far away that Britte and father could never find me.\"\nJouane: \"Now, clear your mind and breathe deeply. Good concentration is very important for spellcasting.\"\nSilver brushes.\nJouane: \"I picked up a set of fine silver brushes in the city, Reldith. I thought you might be interested.\"\nReldith: \"How thoughtful! I'll come take a look after supper.\"\nJouane and Ennis.\nJouane: \"The last time I was in Whiterun, the tradesmen were talking about you. It seems your reputation as a businessman is growing.\"\nEnnis: \"Glad to hear all my hard work has paid off. Maybe we'll fetch a better price for our crops next time we're in the city.\"\nJouane and Erik.\nJouane: \"Anything I can pick up for you on my next trip into the city, Erik?\"\nErik: \"Thanks for the offer, Jouane, but I'm saving up for a new sword.\"\nJouane and Lemkil.\nJouane: \"Good day, Lemkil. I saw some nice dresses for your little girls while I was in Whiterun. I'd be happy to purchase them, if you like.\"\nLemkil: \"We don't need your charity, Breton. If my girls deserve something nice, it'll be their father who buys it.\"\nGood harvest.\nRorik: \"Looks like we're in for quite a harvest. We've had better luck with our planting than any village in the hold.\"\nJouane: \"Luck? I think it has more to do with the hard work and good soil.\"\nRorik: \"Maybe you're right. Even so, I can't help wondering if some other force it at work here.\"\nWheat shipment.\nJouane: \"The last wheat shipment fetched a fine price at market.\"\nRorik: \"Well done! I don't know where I'd be without you, my old friend.\"\nJouane: \"It pleases me to know that I can still be of use even in the twilight of my life.\"\nInteractions.\n&lt;a href=\"Lemkil\"&gt;Lemkil&lt;/a&gt; will send a letter to the &lt;a href=\"Last%20Dragonborn\"&gt;Dragonborn&lt;/a&gt; if Jouane is killed, saying:\n\"I am aware of your recent assault on Jouane Manette. Rest assured that I have no interest in that particular matter. I do, however, have an interest in your willingness to employ force when the need arises.

It has four tabs: Status, Inventory, Magic, and Maps/Quests. Each tab has five sections.\nOn the PC, each of the four major tabs has an associated &lt;a href=\"hotkey\"&gt;hotkey&lt;/a&gt;. Status can be reached by F1, Inventory by F2, Magic by F3, and Maps/Quests by F4. On the Xbox 360 version the journal can be accessed by pressing the B button and tabs are navigated by using the left and right triggers. Similarly, on the PS3 version the journal is opened with the circle button and tabs can be switched with the R1 and L1 buttons.\nIn , the journal is no longer part of the inventory, skills, or magic systems and exists as a means of quest tracking. Players can track multiple quests simultaneously and view brief cliff notes on their status in any quest(s) they are involved in.\nStatus page.\nThe Status page is most useful when checking how far you have to go until your next level, and for getting a more in-depth analysis of your &lt;a href=\"Health%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;Health&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Magicka%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;Magicka&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Fatigue%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;Fatigue&lt;/a&gt;.

You can view the &lt;a href=\"Factions%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;Factions&lt;/a&gt; you are a member of and what Rank you hold within them.\nInventory page.\nThe Inventory page is probably going to be the most used. Here you can get an overview of everything on your person, or filter what you see by &lt;a href=\"Weapons%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;Weapons&lt;/a&gt;; &lt;a href=\"Apparel\"&gt;Apparel&lt;/a&gt;; &lt;a href=\"Potions%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;Potions&lt;/a&gt;/&lt;a href=\"Ingredients%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;Ingredients&lt;/a&gt;; and finally &lt;a href=\"Keys%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;Keys&lt;/a&gt;, Stones and &lt;a href=\"Books%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;Books&lt;/a&gt;/&lt;a href=\"Scrolls%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;Scrolls&lt;/a&gt;. If you're a high-level character, or otherwise have a high &lt;a href=\"Strength%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;Strength&lt;/a&gt; score, any of these lists can get quite long. Make sure you get a &lt;a href=\"House\"&gt;place&lt;/a&gt; to store your belongings as soon as possible, especially if you enjoy collecting trophies, to help keep these lists relatively uncluttered.\nMagic page.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Magicka%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;Magic&lt;/a&gt; pages contain every spell that you know, as well as providing another access to your magical scrolls. There are filters for all magic you know; any scrolls in your possession; spells that target others; spells that target yourself; and any current effects you are under, including &lt;a href=\"Diseases%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;Diseases&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Poisons%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;Poisons&lt;/a&gt; and magically induced Conditions.\nMaps and Quests page.\nYour Maps and Quests page is also frequently used. Here there are tabs for seeing a map of your immediate surroundings; a larger scale map of all &lt;a href=\"Cyrodiil\"&gt;Cyrodiil&lt;/a&gt;; your active &lt;a href=\"Quests%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;Quests&lt;/a&gt; page; all Quests you know about; and all the Quests you have since completed. After your Inventory, this will probably be your most used page.\nHotkeys.\nIn , hotkeys are provided for easy access to the journal tabs. On the PC, the following keyboard commands will have the listed action."}

With the exact combination of domination spells I have created, I now have total control over the hallucinations (along with persistence) without the need for costly enchantments. This is a timely find as the subject recently indicated that removal of the amulet might be preferable to the current stages of the experiment.

Nay, I need her patience. Only an immortal could put up with these ... people! The Nedes are well-named. Yes, they spent many years shackled and tormented by the Ayleids, but none alive today remember that suffering first-hand! The recompense they demand continues to escalate, even as the pride of the Ayleids swells. I sense they will break off negotiations any day now, and we may go from uneasy peace to outright war.\nAh, Azura\u2014keep me from speaking with them! The power of my voice can change their reality, but that would be a bandage on an infected wound. Nothing but true change can allay the anger between these peoples.\n27 Sun's Height\nThe worst has happened. One of the Ayleids is dead, a messenger killed while running errands. The Ayleids suspect the Nedes and they do not deny it. Rather, they take umbrage ... as if the death of one messenger cannot be measured against the long suffering they endured. This will not go well. My voice may be the only answer.\n29 Sun's Height\nI stand amazed. I did use my voice, but only ... adjusted reality somewhat, to forestall conflict. The true miracle came from a Nede and an Ayleid. Both outsiders to the negotiation, they joined together to solve the mystery of the murdered messenger ... and found the culprit neither Nede nor Ayleid! A servant of &lt;a href=\"Molag%20Bal\"&gt;Molag Bal&lt;/a&gt; was responsible, his aim to sabotage these negotiations!\nThe two heroes have done what I could not. They've brought Nede and Ayleid together against a common foe. I foresee hostilities between these two peoples ended.\n2 Last Seed\nWith the wedding of the two heroes, the breach has been closed. But I cannot imagine Molag Bal will let this go unchallenged. I will seek an answer ... a way to shield these peoples in Azura's name.

I've never felt more at home.\nMephala's presence only grows stronger as you descend.

Mephala's servants, the &lt;a href=\"Spiderkith\"&gt;Spiderkith&lt;/a&gt;, stalk these chambers, whispering dark secrets to one another in a tongue no mortal understands. But this is still a pale reflection of what's to come.\nBeyond the caves, the very fabric of reality begins to fray. Somehow Mephala's dark realm, the &lt;a href=\"Spiral%20Skein\"&gt;Spiral Skein&lt;/a&gt;, has claimed this place. Its inky tendrils stretch out in every direction, seducing pilgrims and prey alike--claiming them with a cold, chitinous embrace. This is what drove the Imperials to destroy the fort. They found this nexus and sought to hide it from the world. Shortsighted fools, the lot of them. How could someone turn their back on this sublime darkness?\nAfter walking these gloomy hallways for a week or more, I feel the weight of it\u2014the horror, I mean. It's as if all this dark beauty could collapse in on itself at any moment. Someone is holding open the nexus by will alone.

In time, I shall become her servant, and together we will bring this world to heel. All will fear Mephala. All will love Mephala.

I love working with the knowledge of the ages. I know that no mere mortal endeavor could equal something as vast and comprehensive as the Apocrypha of Hermaeus Mora, but I am content here. And, of course, I have not sold my soul in servitude to a Daedric Prince to dwell amid a wealth of information and history. (Though sometimes I do dream of wandering the endless stacks of Apocrypha.)\nI have told the younger acolytes repeatedly that they must individually dust each book and then carefully replace it. I caught Gatrin dusting a shelf of books, just swiping a cloth across the spines as casual as can be. He was not wearing gloves, either, and I have reinforced, time and time again, the need to keep the natural oils from our skin away from these precious tomes.\nI would like to say that the wars do not trouble me, but that would be a lie. I spoke with Lady Dresan the Elder about the fate of this treasure trove of knowledge preserved within the keep. The books on arcane magic, in particular, should not fall into the wrong hands. We have a plan of preservation that falls mainly upon my shoulders to implement. Most of the staff has fled as the fighting intensifies. Some have gone to join the wars, to return home to families. Others have gone to I know not where. A few of my colleagues remain, however. Dresan Keep is our home and its library of knowledge our life's work. I shall enlist their aid in preparing a safe space for the most important treasures in the library. Sacrifices will be required.\nTime has taken on a strange pace, but it is peaceful here now. I have made a vow to protect the keep's treasures. We spent countless years indexing all of the volumes within the collection. At the risk of flattering myself, my series of charts that cross-reference people, places, and relevant tomes in the collection is both useful and a work of art. Someone, someday, will need the information we have collected, and they will know how to put it to good use.\nI worry about mildew, though."}

Greedy fools.\nStill no spoils to speak of. We're catching frogs to stretch our limited supplies, but we'll be down to boiled boot leather soon if nothing changes. I'm skipping meals to keep &lt;a href=\"Julietta%20the%20Skin%20Taker\"&gt;Julitta&lt;/a&gt; fed. This is no place for a sick child.\nFandus assured me that things are going to be all right. We fought about it. He told me the gang is planning a raid. I don't like it. The nearest village belongs to those Root-House People. Nasty folk. Territorial. Fandus says they're going to hit their food stores while most of the warriors are out hunting. I can't argue. We need food.\nJulitta is anxious in the empty camp. She won't stop asking when her father will be back. She's realized now that I'm lying when I tell her \"soon.\"\nThey did it. Fandus and the rest strode into camp cocksure and grinning like fools, but their arms were laden with fresh food and dried goods. I still can't believe they pulled off that raid. We'll eat well tonight and a few weeks more at least.\nIt's been three days now. I've screamed myself mute and cried myself dry. I can't go on like this. I have to keep Julitta alive. She's finally sleeping. I should do the same.\nThose eyes. I keep waking up to those beady yellow eyes. Every time, it's like I'm there again. I only realize it's not real because I don't hear Julitta screaming as they drag her out of bed. Dagging lizards.\nI chanced taking us deeper into the swamp, toward &lt;a href=\"Blackrose\"&gt;Blackrose&lt;/a&gt;, but it paid off. I found another camp of &lt;a href=\"Blackguards\"&gt;Blackguards&lt;/a&gt;. They didn't seem keen on taking on more mouths to feed. A few were sizing me up for the cages, I could tell, but Gruznak agreed to take me on so long as I pull my weight. He told me later it was my eyes that made the decision. Said he could tell I'd have killed the lot of them with my bare hands before I let them cage up my little girl. He was right.\nGruznak has me feeding the stock for now. I have to choke down bile every time I look at one of them. The broken ones don't trouble me at least. It's the fresh ones I hate. At least when you tame a dog you don't have to listen to it try and beg in your language. I hit him until he stopped moving.\nI got an earful about damaging the stock. It was the teeth that were the problem. Buyers don't like unsightly beasts. Gruznak said to remember that next time. He wants me to start breaking in the fresh ones. Said I was a natural.\nIt feels like time has flown by since we got here. Feels almost like we've got a future here. Gruznak's a savvy leader. He takes the lion's share of the bounty, but he sees that we're all living well. Julitta and I a little more than the rest. Think he's got a shine on me.\nAnother year, come and gone. Fast. Wish I could hang onto the good years longer. I haven't wanted for food or a warm bed for a long time, but I still catch myself tucking away what I can. I hate that gnawing fear. The lizards' eyes stare at me in my sleep. I'll cut two out tomorrow. Gruznak be damned.\nJulitta's no little girl anymore. Her innocence is all but gone now, what little the mud-lizards left her. Feels like she was clinging to my skirt just a week ago and now she's fending off the advances of Gruznak's boot-licks with the knife I gave her. She's of the age where she's going to need to pull her weight now, might as well teach her to use it.\nI gave Julitta a timid &lt;a href=\"Bright-Throat%20Tribe\"&gt;Bright-Throat&lt;/a&gt; to mind. She feared him at first, but I showed her we don't need to be afraid of the beasts anymore.\nJulitta enjoys leading the Bright-Throat around by a leash. I haven't seen her so care free in a long time. I never realized how much fear she was still carrying around. I'll let her enjoy it another few days, then we'll have to have to have a chat about thinking of the mud-lizards as pets.\nGruznak's slaving business is booming. The gang's ranks have tripled just since he opened a channel to the &lt;a href=\"House%20Telvanni%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Telvanni&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"Vvardenfell%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Vvardenfell&lt;/a&gt;.

I'll take the captain by surprise, grab the pearl, and leave him for dead. If I know Summerset soldiers, they'll follow me into the ruins. And then, well... the buyer has assured me that they'll take care of the soldiers. Permanently.\nI'll report that &lt;a href=\"Bandits%20%28Online%29\"&gt;bandits&lt;/a&gt; stole the pearl, and there won't be a mer alive who can contradict me. If all goes well, my position should remain intact. By &lt;a href=\"Oblivion%20%28Realm%29\"&gt;Oblivion&lt;/a&gt;, I may even be promoted for my bravery. And Sarocil will have the gold she needs.

Food should never be prepared with spite.\nInstead, I went to the ailing Queen and asked what I could make for her. I could see that she knew she would not make it through the night. But she smiled faintly and humored me. She asked for my longfin stew.\n27 Second Seed, 2E 409\nKing Anton has survived the poisoned darts of the assassins. The staff has worked diligently to prepare the most healthful food to help speed his recovery. I caught Gloria slipping potions of fortitude and health into his soup.

The new Seneschal serves him well, but still he looks after this old man.\n12 Last Seed, 2E 431\nI think I died today. It is difficult to say. I can walk around and speak, but there is a detached feeling. I can feel the crown I am bound to, sitting in its chest, and the servant who watches me raise the pen and write these words looks at me fearfully.\nI still serve my King, even in this spirit form. I do not tire and I possess a form so much closer to my younger self. I can serve until my King's bones turn to dust. And so I shall.\n11 Hearthfire, 2E 450\nThe King passed away today and will be sealed in a tomb. I am to be his guardian. I could do with the solitude.

He had begun teaching me to fight the moment I was able to pick up a blade. Mother had argued that I was too young, but he paid her no mind. I can still remember the elation I felt the first time I bested Father in a match and the look of pride on his face. If it were up to him I know he would have allowed me to join him in battle. With me at his side he may have fared better. Now with Father and so many others slain, the Old Ones claim we are left with too few warriors to continue the fight. I was not the only Young One to speak out in protest, but our small voices went unheard. It has been decided that we must flee to seek help and protection.\nEighth Evening Star\nNews has reached us that the great &lt;a href=\"Snow%20Prince\"&gt;Snow Prince&lt;/a&gt; has fallen in battle. The urgency to go into hiding has left many of us scattered and those of us still together unsure of which direction to turn.

At once, the torches in the room flared a bright, but unearthly shade of green. The pounding of my own heart filled my ears.\nThe awful event was very sudden, and wholly unexpected. The &lt;a href=\"Skeleton%20%28Online%29\"&gt;skeleton&lt;/a&gt; shuddered, and from the black void between its lipless grin, the most appalling succession of cries issued forth, echoing through the stone chamber of the crypt.

I envy the long dormancy of &lt;a href=\"Draugr%20%28Online%29\"&gt;draugr&lt;/a&gt; at times like this.\nSensing my malaise, one of my ambitious attendants took it upon herself to seek a distraction for her master. She brought me a dry volume of &lt;a href=\"Dwemer\"&gt;Dwemer&lt;/a&gt; history to while away my time. I briefly considered watching her corpse dry into a leathery husk as a more thrilling alternative, but there was a confident smirk in her expression that convinced me to indulge her.\n&lt;a href=\"Lizabet\"&gt;Lizabet&lt;/a&gt; has served me well. The book she brought me provides a kernel of truth to a fanciful legend. The author claims to have paid a recent visit to the long lost ruin known as &lt;a href=\"Fang%20Lair%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Fang Lair&lt;/a&gt;. I believe I'd like to see this necropolis.\nThe bulk of my followers now scour the &lt;a href=\"Dragon%27s%20Teeth%20Mountains\"&gt;Dragon's Teeth Mountains&lt;/a&gt; for Fang Lair. Even with clues provided by the historian, it will be quite an undertaking. Even so, this renewed purpose has bolstered my patience.\nDuring these months of search, I've collected many records on Dwemer and &lt;a href=\"Dragons%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Dragons&lt;/a&gt;. Their ambitions were not dissimilar. Mastery over existence! I'm not so different, though we've all chosen different avenues to explore. Considering their fates, I have no desire to follow in their footsteps.\nFinally, Fang Lair is in my grasp. The price paid was quite light. The lives of a few dozen of my followers were claimed by these treacherous mountains, but they are settling into their new roles as well as can be expected.\nThis place is beautifully desolate. The bones of thousands are strewn throughout the crumbling halls. Some shattered, some blackened, and some fossilized in the stone itself. A record of extinction and terror, but is the centerpiece to this exhibit to be found here among them?\nNow here's an unexpected turn. Fang Lair was not entirely uninhabited. We had a very special squatter in our midst: an ancient &lt;a href=\"Lich%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Lich&lt;/a&gt; from a time when &lt;a href=\"Thurvokun\"&gt;the Dragon&lt;/a&gt; still lived and breathed, and one of the group responsible for ensuring it ceased to do so. He has so much to tell me, once I've made him more compliant.\nThe Lich conducted obsessive studies of the Dragon's remains during his stay here, so very kind of him to share. Adapting them to my methods will not be difficult. I'm already envisioning a wondrous display, though my conversation with the Lich and his companions has revealed a missing element. This Dragon possessed a &lt;a href=\"Dragon%20Priests%20%28Online%29\"&gt;priesthood&lt;/a&gt; during its lifetime and &lt;a href=\"Zaan\"&gt;the High Priestess&lt;/a&gt; is nowhere to be found.

The captain I knew slipped away in the fog to be replaced by spectre of anger and hate.\nA projection of Baron-Admiral &lt;a href=\"Bendu%20Olo\"&gt;Olo&lt;/a&gt; appeared on our deck.

They whispered curses to their &lt;a href=\"Daedric%20Lord\"&gt;Daedric Lord&lt;/a&gt;s with their dying breaths are we took their gold, their goods, and their lives.\nThe blue light atop the coral tower began to pulse and bleed energy into the clouded sky. When the ground beneath our feet began to quake and tremble, no one had to tell us to run. The island began to crack and sink. The sea around &lt;a href=\"Thras\"&gt;Thras&lt;/a&gt; boiled as we rowed for our lives back to the &lt;a href=\"Golden%20Era\"&gt;Golden Era&lt;/a&gt;.\nWe were hauled back on deck in time to watch the Coral Tower collapse into the sea.

Now I cannot know our number. The fog, with its stench of rot and terrible foulness, obscures our vision and makes it hard to see beyond two lengths of the mast. We passed rocks as we approached that were only a few paces from our hull. We hear the cracks and screams that indicate our sister ships were not so lucky.\nThe fog ended today. We emerged from what appeared to be a solid wall of cloud that extended in an unbroken circle around the islands of the &lt;a href=\"Sload\"&gt;Sload&lt;/a&gt;s. Our first view of the largest island was awe-inspiring: a tower, taller than any I have ever seen and made of blood-red coral, reached into the sky.

It may not have been by the book, but hey, nothing ever is. Little things at first, things I thought I'd forget by the end of the week. A well-placed bribe here, a promise that my superiors would know nothing about. I kept slipping, and slipping, until I was telling myself that phrase every night. It got the job done.\nAnd who could really question my goals? The &lt;a href=\"House%20Redoran%20%28Online%29\"&gt;House Redoran's&lt;/a&gt; Narcotics Oath-Bureau is one of the best forces for good &lt;a href=\"Vvardenfell%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Vvardenfell&lt;/a&gt; has to offer. What could be more noble? We were cleaning up Vvardenfell, one arrest at a time. Anyone who went undercover knew the stakes, and they knew that our superiors were more apt to look the other way if the results were to their liking. Maybe that was my first mistake. Thinking no one was looking.\nThe &lt;a href=\"skooma\"&gt;skooma&lt;/a&gt; ring I infiltrated was top priority. Skooma is nasty stuff, an opiate that causes hallucinations. Addictive, deadly, cheap, the drug's a powerful combination. Even the growth and sale of moon sugar is illegal on Vvardenfell's shores, for good reason. With such a high stakes case they decided to send their best officer, who at the time happened to be me.\nWhen an officer infiltrates a skooma ring there are the expectations, and then there's the reality. They can't avoid certain habits. Bribes are commonplace, extortion as well. No one talks about torture when you're signing up, but it happens. Deaths come with a bit of paperwork, but hey, who's going to mourn a dealer? All of these you can learn to live with. It's what you eventually can't live without that eats you up.\nIt shouldn't be surprising that few skooma rings accept members who don't use the product, at least occasionally. There's no bigger red flag than turning down an offered pipe, and in my line of work even the smallest of suspicions can lead to a quiet death in some dark alley.\nThe case itself went off without a hitch. I did my usual reconnaissance, gained trust of those up top. Found out who was in charge and where trade was coming in. The case closed within three months, quicker than any other officer could have finished it. But not quick enough.\nI admit, I was hooked. It was an itch I couldn't scratch, a thought I couldn't drown out. I started drinking, thinking that would numb the withdrawal. But drink simply washed away my resolve, and eventually I was searching for dealers for a whole different reason.\nIt was fine for a time. I was able to keep my dosages short, concealed my habit from those around me. It all fell apart when another officer brought in my dealer, and she was more than happy to talk. Not surprising, but I suppose addiction doesn't bring the clearest of mindsets.\nI was told I was lucky to be stripped of my rank and not thrown behind bars, but I'm not one to lie down and accept my disgrace. I'm nothing if not resourceful. I've sobered up and smartened up, and now I'm on a new mission. I'll win back my honor if it's the last thing I do, no matter the means."}

No, it's not food, though eating the bland gruel given out here has become torturous at best. And no, it's not the smell of the Green, though it seems like the stench of metal fills me to the brim. And no, it's not safety, because if &lt;a href=\"Grahtwood\"&gt;Grahtwood&lt;/a&gt; has taught me anything, it's to fear danger at every turn.\nYou know what I miss the most? My dog.\nJona's a lovely creature, she is. Shaggy gray coat, bright pink tongue. Her eyes look like two stars, golden and shining. I miss her wagging tail, always there to meet me when I came home. Her love of fetching sticks in the meadows. &lt;a href=\"Y%27ffre\"&gt;Y'ffre&lt;/a&gt;'s name, curse it all, I even miss her barking in the middle of the night. I'm sorry I ever cursed her for it, because I know she was just doing her best to be a good dog.\nPerhaps I'm pathetic for admitting it, but I'll be damned if it's not true. But even though I miss Jona, I still wouldn't wish this life on her. In fact, I'm sure she would have been eaten by now if she did end up here with me. Either that, or killed by one of the monstrous constructs around here.\nAll it took was one foggy night of too much Sun's Dusk Ale. Mother always told me I was too much a fool to have magic, and I'll be damned, she was right. I must have used that portal spell near a hundred times before, and all it took was some slurring of the &lt;a href=\"Ehlnofex\"&gt;Ehlnofex&lt;/a&gt;, perhaps a switched up syllable or two. And here I am, lonely and bitter, wasting my time writing about my damn dog.\nI just hope she's being taken care of. My cousin Brelenel would check on her when I traveled, but Jona needs a proper home and a kind hand. I can hardly believe I'm more worried about her than myself! Me, well, I can look after my own arse. Who's going to look after hers?"}

Perhaps I can use the knowledge to raise my status back in &lt;a href=\"Morrowind%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Morrowind&lt;/a&gt;.

It is his feeling that two forts can support and aid each other, greatly increasing our hold over the region. After a quick examination of our options, I've decided that we can build this new fort on the foundation of the ancient ruins in the\u00a0&lt;a href=\"Lorkrata%20Hills\"&gt;Lorkrata Hills&lt;/a&gt;.\nConstruction began today on the new fort. Nestled in the foothills below the mountains, the engineers are building the walls and towers to align with the area's natural stone. We are also expanding into the ancient network of tunnels and chambers beneath the hills, using the original construction as a basis. The work is slow, however, as we persevere not to collapse the entire mountainside atop us.\nAs work on the\u00a0&lt;a href=\"Hall%20of%20Heroes\"&gt;Hall of Heroes&lt;/a&gt;\u00a0started, we uncovered a curious runestone. Nothing like it has turned up in any of the texts I've consulted, and it doesn't seem to have any innate powers that I can see. I will keep it with me, where it will remain safe and so that I can study it at my leisure. Perhaps it will reveal its purpose to me at the proper time.\nAs I walked with the engineer to examine the newly opened corridors, the runestone began to glow. The intensity of the glow seemed to respond to specific locations within the corridors. I need to investigate this phenomena more closely, but later. When the halls are empty and I can perform my studies away from prying eyes.\nI discovered the source of the runestone's strange behavior\u2014I think. An ancient relic. half-buried in the ancient soil, seems to be of\u00a0&lt;a href=\"Ayleid\"&gt;Ayleid&lt;/a&gt;\u00a0origin. When the runestone and the relic are in close proximty, the air itself seems to hum with intense energy. The discovery excites me and frightens me at the same time. I have sent for King Ranser. I'll let him decide what we should do with these ancient items.\nKing Ranser has decided that the best course of action is to hide the relic and the runestone. We've assembled a small trusted team of workers to build a secret room next to the Hall of Heros. We will hide the relic there. I have not yet decided on a place to hide the runestone, however."}

It also briefly describes him going mad after being locked in his chambers for an extensive amount of time.\nContents.\nEntry 1..\nBeauty! Pure and sublime. That is the only way to accurately describe my love, the maiden gro-Malog. True, the &lt;a href=\"Orsimer%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;Orcs&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"Tamriel\"&gt;Tamriel&lt;/a&gt; are often vilified by the other citizens of the Empire, and rarely would they be considered a pleasure to look upon. So, is my maiden Luktuv a rare breed of Orc, unlike the rest of her kin in physical appearance? Nay. In fact, she is the perfect representative of her race, green skin, muscular frame and all. But beautiful she is, all the same. For who am I to judge? Who am I to criticize when so many would condemn my very existence? I can only hope my love is as understanding when she learns of my unique condition, for I have yet to reveal that most precious of secrets.\nEntry 2..\nDamn the politics of my station! Taxation and trade negotiations and meetings with disingenuous aristocrats -- it's sometimes enough to make me regret my birthright altogether. I've spent the latter half of my life hiding my identity, guarding my secret. But now I am faced with an even greater challenge, for if word were to get out that I have fallen in love with a servant -- and an Orc, no less -- I would be all but ruined! Such is the life of the &lt;a href=\"Cyrodiil\"&gt;Cyrodilic&lt;/a&gt; nobleman.\nEntry 3..\nCurse me for a coward, but I have not yet found the strength to tell my beloved Luktuv the truth. Perhaps it's for the best, for what benefit is there in her knowing? She would share all of my fears but none of my abilities. Her life would become one of doubt and uncertainty. Still, if she is to spend her remaining mortal days with me, she has the right to know the truth.\nEntry 4.\nJoy and exaltation! She is with child! My beloved Luktuv is carrying my child! The midwives predict a boy, and we have already settled on the name Agronak. In truth, I never realized such miracles were even possible, but &lt;a href=\"the%20Divines\"&gt;the Divines&lt;/a&gt; have granted us their blessing, and so shall it be. I must wonder, of course, if my dear child will share in my Dark Gift. Only time will tell.\nEntry 5.\nTonight the truth will be revealed. I will tell my beloved Luktuv everything. She will know who and what I am, and we will decide how best to raise the precious child that grows in her womb.\nEntry 6.\nBetrayal! Foul and loathsome harlot! How dare Luktuv question my motives, question the love I have for my own unborn child! When she learned the truth, that I, the Lord Lovidicus, am no longer human, that I have walked Tamriel as a &lt;a href=\"Vampire%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;vampire&lt;/a&gt; for the past two hundred years, how quickly she judged me! So, I am a monster, am I? Perhaps I should have proven her right. Perhaps I should have drained her dry when I had the chance! But I loved her, as deeply as a man has ever loved a woman, and I wanted nothing more than to bring our baby into this world and embrace my new role as father. Perhaps when Luktuv has come to her senses -- for she refuses to come out of her room -- we can have rational discourse about our future. I do not, however, retain much hope.\nEntry 7.\nImprisoned! Imprisoned in my own home! While I slept, Luktuv locked me in my own private chambers. She called to me through the doors, told me of her plan to escape with our unborn child. She means to keep my baby from me! When I get free, I will find the traitorous whore and rip the child from her very womb!\nEntry 8.\nTwo weeks. Two weeks have passed since Luktuv locked me in my quarters. Try as I might, I cannot free myself. I cannot breach the doors! If I don't feed soon, I feel I will go mad.\nEntry 9.\nFood blood blood blood blood I need it I need blood need blood."}

This is because the rats themselves ate moon sugar before the tigers ate them, causing the senche-tigers to become tired and lazy. Recently, Headwoman &lt;a href=\"Harrani\"&gt;Harrani&lt;/a&gt; has required inspections of all of the farms in order to crack down on smuggling and the &lt;a href=\"skooma\"&gt;skooma&lt;/a&gt; trade.

If his conscience allows it, our inspector lets us continue our way of life. All is well.\"\nConversations.\nWhen Inspector Tarma arrives:\nJuranda-ra: \"We did not expect you so soon, Inspector Tarma.\"\nInspector Tarma: \"One must arrive early to see the truth of things.\"\nJuranda-ra: \"The truth? But we have nothing to hide, Inspector.\"\nInspector Tarma: \"I hear that often, Clan Mother.

Still, we have the matter in hand.\"\nInspector Tarma: \"Do you?\"\nJuranda-ra: \"Indeed, we brought in a specialist. This one assures you, Inspector, the matter will be resolved shortly.\"\nInspector Tarma: \"Clan Mother, tell me your thoughts on the skooma trade.\"\nJuranda-ra: \"Moon-sugar is more than a spice, to some of us. Using it to brew skooma is an abomination.\"\nInspector Tarma: \"Then you would have no idea who might supply such an operation\u2026?\"\nJuranda-ra: \"None in this one's employ. We want nothing to do with skooma, Inspector.

Wherever did you find this specialist of yours?\"\nJuranda-ra: \"Rajhin's own luck, Inspector. As though ja-Kha'jay provided us with the one we most needed.\"\nInspector Tarma: \"Quaint. Might I suggest a more rigorous selection process? Freelancers are not always so \u2026 competent.\"\nJuranda-ra: \"As you can see, vermin aren't tolerated at Laughing Moons Plantation!\"\nInspector Tarma: \"A spectacular display. If all your hirelings are as capable as your specialist, you've no need to worry.\"\nJuranda-ra: \"This one is delighted by your words, Inspector.\"\nInspector Tarma: \"I said 'if,' Clan Mother.\"\nInspector Tarma: \"There's no question, Juranda-ra. Your Specialist certainly showed the vermin their place.\"\nJuranda-ra: \"Of Course, Inspector. We could expect nothing less of specialists!\"\nInspector Tarma: \"Haldoril, make a note.

You arrived before the great storm, yes?\"\nInspector Tarma: \"Yes, we arrived in Mistral before it struck. I understand the rest of the fleet was not so lucky.\"\nJuranda-ra: \"My condolences, Inspector. Khenarthi's price is not always so high. We can only hope she'll return some of those she has taken.\"\nInspector Tarma: \"I'll require accommodations for myself and my aid. You'll provide them, of course?\"\nJuranda-ra: \"Naturally. Will you be dining with us, as well?\"\nInspector Tarma: \"Erm \u2026 that will not be necessary. Khajiiti fare is too \u2026 cultural for my palate.\"\nJuranda-ra: \"Will you be staying with us long, Inspector?\"\nInspector Tarma: \"As long as necessary. One can only tolerate so much fresh air.\"\nJuranda-ra: \"Truly? Then we'll endeavor to make your stay comfortable.\"\nInspector Tarma: \"Don't fret overmuch.

During the battle, the Dwemer and the Chimer completely annihilated the Nordic armies, forcing them out of &lt;a href=\"Morrowind\"&gt;Morrowind&lt;/a&gt; and back to &lt;a href=\"Skyrim\"&gt;Skyrim&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe Way of the Voice.\nAfter the aforementioned disastrous battle, where his army was annihilated, he spent seven years pondering the meaning of his defeat. He finally came to the conclusion that the Gods had punished the Nords for their arrogant and blasphemous misuse of the &lt;a href=\"Thu%27um\"&gt;Thu'um&lt;/a&gt;. Following this revelation, Jurgen developed a pacifist creed called the &lt;a href=\"Way%20of%20the%20Voice\"&gt;Way of the Voice&lt;/a&gt; that preached the Thu'um should only be used for the worship and glory of the gods rather than martial exploits. After he converted to pacifism he became known as \"Jurgen the Calm.\"\nMastery.\nHis philosophy prevailed, largely due to his unshakable mastery of the Voice. His victory was sealed in a legendary confrontation, where The Calm is said to have \"swallowed the Shouts\" of seventeen Tongues of the militant school for three days until his opponents all lay exhausted. These Tongues later became his disciples.\nFounding of the Greybeards.\nIt was after this confrontation he founded the Greybeards, a monastic order dedicated to mastering the Way of the Voice. He also built &lt;a href=\"High%20Hrothgar%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;High Hrothgar&lt;/a&gt;, located near the peak of &lt;a href=\"Throat%20of%20the%20World%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Throat of the World&lt;/a&gt;, which served as the monastery where the Greybeards meditated and perfected their voice.\nDeath.\nIt is unknown when or how Jurgen Windcaller died, but he was buried in &lt;a href=\"Ustengrav\"&gt;Ustengrav&lt;/a&gt; along with some of his possessions, including his &lt;a href=\"Horn%20of%20Jurgen%20Windcaller\"&gt;horn&lt;/a&gt;.

He has given them a sketch which will help to identify this ruin, as well as one of the carving which he wants. He also gave them a carved stone key which will allow them to enter the central chamber of the High Fane when finding it.\nWalkthrough.\nIf one have already been to &lt;a href=\"Malada\"&gt;Malada&lt;/a&gt; or read the book \"&lt;a href=\"Cleansing%20of%20the%20Fane\"&gt;Cleansing of the Fane&lt;/a&gt;\" the quest will update as soon as Umbacano gives the Hero the quest. If not head over to the &lt;a href=\"First%20Edition%20%28Location%29\"&gt;First Edition&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;a href=\"Imperial%20City%2C%20Market%20District\"&gt;Market District&lt;/a&gt; and grab a copy of \"Cleansing of the Fane\".\nThey also might run into &lt;a href=\"Claude%20Maric\"&gt;Claude Maric&lt;/a&gt;, a rival treasure hunter who wishes to talk to them about the High Fane at the &lt;a href=\"Tiber%20Septim%20Hotel\"&gt;Tiber Septim Hotel&lt;/a&gt;. Talking to him will also mark Malada on the map. He will also tell them to pick up a copy of Cleansing of the Fane.\nTravel to Malada and outside there will be a camp with a Khajiit named &lt;a href=\"S%27razirr\"&gt;S'razirr&lt;/a&gt;. Talking to him reveals that he is working for Claude Maric and for part of the reward he will help them instead. If they wish one can bring him down to a quarter of the reward but he is not important.\nInside the ruins, follow the marker until finding a door with a seal on it. If they have the carved stone key the door will open and they can grab the carving. As soon as the carving is gone, the wall will go down and behind there will be a &lt;a href=\"Lich%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;Lich&lt;/a&gt; waiting to attack. Eliminating him will make it easier to exit the ruin.\nAfter exiting the ruins the Hero is accosted by Claude Maric, who orders them to hand over the carving. Unfortunately, he is not alone, and flanking him is the mercenary &lt;a href=\"Rigmor\"&gt;Rigmor&lt;/a&gt; and her men. There is an option to choose to give up the carving or fight their way out. If they give up the carving they will forfeit the reward unless one steals it back from Claude.\nIf they fight their way out, once Claude Maric's life gets low enough, he will surrender to them and either give them the carving or let them keep it.\nMaric will ride away right after he orders Rigmor to kill the Hero and might not return to try and kill them. If this happens and he still is alive after the Hero has left the ruin, he will be with Umbacano in the next quest. After killing the mercenaries, return to Lord Umbacano for the reward."}

When their &lt;a href=\"magicka\"&gt;magicka&lt;/a&gt; is depleted, or when the Dragonborn gets too close to them, they will switch to a lesser ward spell, which increases their defense, and a dagger or mace for offense. They wear mage robes that increase magicka regeneration, and no armor. Weapons with shock enchantments, or shock spells, can drain them of their magicka quickly, taking away their main offensive capabilities and opening them up for attack. \u00a0\nCompared to other novice mages.\nFrost mages are a bane to any player, hindering mobility and draining stamina, and are more formidable in groups than alone. Their frost magic slows the Dragonborn's movement speed, making them potentially the most dangerous of the novice mages.\nNovice storm mages' spells drain magicka, which can be problematic if the Dragonborn is a mage (especially at lower levels). These spells are as potent as fire or frost spells in terms of damage, so as with any mage, closing on them quickly and killing them before their magic can deplete magicka and health is the best strategy.\nLoot.\nThe Novice Fire Mage drops the following:"}

Throughout the centuries, and for unknown reasons, the afflictions collectively known as vampirism have been transmitted in different ways and taken on different qualities. Herein, I shall try to delineate, to the best of my ability, the qualities of the form of vampirism common to our &lt;a href=\"Second%20Era\"&gt;era&lt;/a&gt;, known as Noxiphilic Sanguivoria, so as to better equip the reader to identify this type of vampire.\nFirst, however, I believe a word of warning is in order. This work is in no way intended as a guide to hunting or otherwise confronting a vampire. In all cases, it is advised that you avoid anyone you suspect of vampirism and certainly that you do not try to fight them. Vampires of all varieties possess supernatural strength and will quickly overpower all but the most experienced hunter.\nThe most important thing to remember about sufferers of Noxiphilic Sanguivoria is that, as the name implies, they are not weakened by daylight as in other strains of vampirism, but are, instead, strengthened during the nighttime hours.\nWhy this is the case is poorly understood. One of the more wild theories is that it is the result of some sort of &lt;a href=\"Daedric\"&gt;Daedric&lt;/a&gt; backroom deal between &lt;a href=\"Hircine\"&gt;Hircine&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Molag%20Bal\"&gt;Molag Bal&lt;/a&gt; that has given sufferers of Noxiphilic Sanguivoria a &lt;a href=\"Werewolf%20%28Online%29\"&gt;werewolf&lt;/a&gt;-like love of moonlight.\nBy night, these hunters are possessed of extreme fortitude and a powerful ability to recover from wounds.\nSufferers of Noxiphilic Sanguivoria, interviewed under heavy sedation, of course, have described a dreamlike passage from when they were first bitten and afflicted with the disease. Some of them have described entering a ritual chamber where they were bathed in a pool of black blood. Whether the transformation actually involves such a terrifying ritual, or whether it was merely a hallucination is impossible to discern without firsthand experience.\nIf you are bitten, or believe to have been bitten, by a carrier of Noxiphilic Sanguivoria, do not panic. If you are able to get away from your attacker, see a priest of &lt;a href=\"Arkay\"&gt;Arkay&lt;/a&gt; immediately. You will not contract full Noxiphilic Sanguivoria without first being exsanguinated by a vampire and then receiving the gift of his or her blood in return."}

It cannot be learned, however, if these rituals actually occurred or if they were simply hallucinations caused by the &lt;a href=\"disease\"&gt;disease&lt;/a&gt; being introduced to the body.\nEffects of the disease.\nIf it is contracted, the blood of uninfected specimens is required for sustenance. Unlike those infected with &lt;a href=\"Sanguinare%20Vampiris\"&gt;Sanguinare Vampiris&lt;/a&gt;, for example, victims of Noxiphilic Sanguivoria are not weakened or otherwise harmed by sunlight; and they are instead strengthened during the night. As such, their regenerative abilities are greatly enhanced at night, and they become immensely courageous and resistant to pain during the darker hours.\nPriests of &lt;a href=\"Arkay\"&gt;Arkay&lt;/a&gt; are usually equipped well enough to cleanse a victim afflicted with this disease; if the victim manages to escape the &lt;a href=\"vampire\"&gt;vampire&lt;/a&gt; attacker before being drained of blood by them and being given blood from them in return, the disease will not have any sort of effect on them."}

All Elders who wish to enter trance-state may do so now.\n&lt;a href=\"Aldmeris\"&gt;Aldmeris&lt;/a&gt; split during the &lt;a href=\"Dawn%20Era\"&gt;Dawn&lt;/a&gt;, but as in all things then, these fractures enjoyed quasi-temporal amendments. Sometimes the Island of Start was with us, othertimes not or not of a whole, close as it was to spirit actual.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Dragons%20%28Lore%29\"&gt;Jills&lt;/a&gt; did not have their full powers; rather, I should say, all the &lt;a href=\"Et%27Ada\"&gt;mundex spirits&lt;/a&gt; had every power at every time amendment at every ordering, which is to say none of them could ever fully express; our world was young and so were its &lt;a href=\"Aedra\"&gt;architect gods&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe next is known to all of us in different ways, and the impossibility of the Dawn lends all of these memories credence. I speak of the &lt;a href=\"Adamantine%20Tower\"&gt;Ur-Tower&lt;/a&gt;, Adamantine, anon Direnni, and of its creation and purpose.\n&lt;a href=\"Akatosh\"&gt;Auriel-that-is-Akatosh&lt;/a&gt; returned to &lt;a href=\"Nirn\"&gt;Mundex Arena&lt;/a&gt; from his dominion planet, signaling all &lt;a href=\"Aedra\"&gt;Aedra&lt;/a&gt; to convene at a &lt;a href=\"Convention\"&gt;static meeting&lt;/a&gt; that would last outside of &lt;a href=\"Aurbis\"&gt;aurbic&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"time\"&gt;time&lt;/a&gt;. His sleek and silver vessel became a spike into the changing earth and the glimmerwinds of its impact warned any spirit that entered aura with it would become recorded-- that by consent of presence their actions here would last of a period unassailable, and would be so whatever might come later to these spirits, even if they rejoined the aether or succumbed willingly or by treachery to a &lt;a href=\"Sithis\"&gt;sithite&lt;/a&gt; erasure. Thus could the Aedra and their cohorts truly covene in realness.\nOur forebears saw the erection of Ada-mantia, Ur-Tower, and the Zero Stone. Let the Elders acknowledge this truth: every &lt;a href=\"The%20Towers\"&gt;Tower&lt;/a&gt; bears its Stone. The impossipoint of the Convention was the first, though another bears the true title of First Stone.\nBecause we are finally a pantheosophic assembly, I will not dictate whether &lt;a href=\"Lorkhan\"&gt;Lorkhan&lt;/a&gt; was judged sacred or profane or transcendent at the Convention. My brothers at the &lt;a href=\"Temple%20of%20the%20One\"&gt;Temple of the One&lt;/a&gt; may call a recess after my first graph to discuss this on the tertiary sense-gradient; sametime tendril-argument is encouraged by the Moth. It is my primary intention to show the echo effect of Ada-mantia and why it will eventually trouble Emperor Actual. I can only do this by telling the story of First Stone without causal debate.\n\"Aad semblio impera, dela can carpio semblex.\"\nBy these words I intone the many-headed language of the &lt;a href=\"Ehlnofey\"&gt;Ehlnofey&lt;/a&gt;. The phrase-meanings can be both \"as in the image of the kings become the hearts of their shadows\" and \"the shadows in kingly hearts are images of as\", where \"as\" is meant in the sheathe of an ur word.\nThe outcome of the Convention was to leave the terrestrial sphere in their excess, for its own good, but that it should last after their departure as in the semblance of the Ada-mantia. Mundus was given its second Tower, &lt;a href=\"Red%20Mountain\"&gt;the Red&lt;/a&gt;, whose First Stone was the &lt;a href=\"Heart%20of%20Lorkhan\"&gt;Heart of the World&lt;/a&gt;, \"as in the image.\"\nTime began to last in stepped-fashion. Those spirits that remained, lesser and greater, involuntary or eventual earthbone, surrendered all definite hold on divinity. Aldmeris bore witness and built the remaining towers during the Merethic: &lt;a href=\"White-Gold\"&gt;White-Gold&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Crystal-like-Law\"&gt;Crystal-like-Law&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Orichalc\"&gt;Orichalc&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Green-Sap\"&gt;Green-Sap&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Walk-Brass\"&gt;Walk-Brass&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Snow%20Throat\"&gt;Snow Throat&lt;/a&gt;, and on and on, \"aad semblio impera.\"\nWe come to the first shaper-peoples and the historical lessonates, wherein most reversed in enmity, error, or awe what already existed in both meanings at once: \"Aad semblio impera, dela can carpio semblex.\" What happens when one reverses an inversion; moreso, does so in the living day?\nWe come to the point where &lt;a href=\"Oblivion%20%28Realm%29\"&gt;Oblivion&lt;/a&gt; first troubled our new earth."}

I trust that the learned may differentiate between the Tower of metaphysics and the Towers of History.\nLet us begin the lessonates.\nWhat are &lt;a href=\"The%20Towers\"&gt;the Towers&lt;/a&gt;?\nThey are magical and physical echoes of the &lt;a href=\"Adamantine%20Tower\"&gt;Ur-Tower&lt;/a&gt;, Ada-mantia. Ada-mantia was the first spike of unassailable reality in the &lt;a href=\"Dawn%20Era\"&gt;Dawn&lt;/a&gt;, otherwise called the &lt;a href=\"Convention\"&gt;Zero Stone&lt;/a&gt;. The powers at Ada-mantia were able to determine through this Stone the spread of creation and their parts in it.\nThe powers also created &lt;a href=\"Red%20Mountain\"&gt;Red Tower&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Heart%20of%20Lorkhan\"&gt;First Stone&lt;/a&gt;. This allowed the &lt;a href=\"Mundus\"&gt;Mundus&lt;/a&gt; to exist without the full presence of the divine. In this way, the powers of Ada-mantia granted the Mundus a special kind of divinity, which is called &lt;a href=\"Nirn\"&gt;NIRN&lt;/a&gt;, the consequence of variable fate.\nAfter these two acts, which is commonly called the &lt;a href=\"Convention\"&gt;Convention&lt;/a&gt;, the gods left the earth.\nAs they were the most powerful of lesser spirits in the ages after the Convention and eager to emulate what they saw, the &lt;a href=\"Aldmer\"&gt;Aldmer&lt;/a&gt; began construction of their own towers. That they built more than one shows you that they were not of one mind.\nThe Aldmer began to split along cultural lines, on how best to spread creation and their parts in it. Each Tower that was built exemplified a separate accordance.\nThis sundering of purpose is the myth of the \"destruction of &lt;a href=\"Aldmeris\"&gt;Aldmeris&lt;/a&gt;.\" Outside of the Dawn, and even then only in the dreamtime of its landscape, there was never a terrestrial homeland of the Elves. \"&lt;a href=\"Old%20Ehlnofey\"&gt;Old Ehlnofey&lt;/a&gt;\" is a magical ideal of mixed memories of the Dawn.\nDo not believe the written histories.\nAll mortal life started on the starry heart of Dawn's beauty, &lt;a href=\"Tamriel\"&gt;Tamriel&lt;/a&gt;.\nIf we are in haste, why are we being lectured about the metaphysical meaning of Tower in ancient Aldmeris theology? I will have my adjutant inform me if anything of substance is revealed here. I suggest the rest of the Council do likewise. We have matters of real import to discuss with the Emperor today.\n&lt;a href=\"Ocato\"&gt;Ocato&lt;/a&gt;\nI will second the Chancellor, though he needs none.\nIf the gentleman surrounded by moths would please move on to the present threat assessment phase of his quadragraph...\n&lt;a href=\"Hasphat%20Antabolis\"&gt;Hasphat Antabolis&lt;/a&gt;"}

Oftentimes, the Stones borrowed surplus creation from &lt;a href=\"Oblivion%20%28Realm%29\"&gt;Oblivion&lt;/a&gt;, grafting it to the terrestrial domain of its anointed Tower.\nIt was and is difficult to bypass Oblivion to go directly to creation's source, the &lt;a href=\"Aetherius\"&gt;Aetherius&lt;/a&gt;. It has been done, but not without great expenditure, mundane and otherwise. However, access to Oblivion, the &lt;a href=\"Void\"&gt;Void&lt;/a&gt; that surrounds &lt;a href=\"Nirn\"&gt;Mundex Arena&lt;/a&gt;, which we might touch every night, was child's play in comparison.\nCultivating creatia that washed into the Void from Aetherius became the rule among Stones.\nThe Daedric Realms were formed on much the same principle: padomaic powers using aetherial refuse to build their void-territories. The Towers built on the &lt;a href=\"Mundus\"&gt;Mundus&lt;/a&gt;, since the lands around them congealed in the absence of the gods, were unable to match the capriciousness of the Lords of Misrule.\nSometimes.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Mer\"&gt;Elves&lt;/a&gt; were dividing; some, like the &lt;a href=\"Altmer\"&gt;Altmer&lt;/a&gt;, did their best to advocate \"the will of &lt;a href=\"Anuiel\"&gt;Anuiel&lt;/a&gt;\" and so embraced the chrysalis of the Convention; others, like the &lt;a href=\"Chimer\"&gt;Chimer&lt;/a&gt;, refuted all orderings and aedric measures, following their prophet to \"the Stone that is not a Stone that is.\" The most nefarious Tower, &lt;a href=\"Numidium\"&gt;Walk-Brass&lt;/a&gt;, refuted even more, refuting unto dis-creation, but we shall come to its role in the present danger to Emperor Actual in a moment. It is but a lesser pawn to the greater evil:\nThe Tower of &lt;a href=\"White-Gold%20Tower\"&gt;White-Gold&lt;/a&gt;, whose Stone is &lt;a href=\"Chim-el%20Adabal\"&gt;Chim-el Adabal&lt;/a&gt;, Amulet of Kings, whose masters are returning.

In other words, it was a focus point for (re-)reaching the divine.\nWhite-Gold Tower was made by the &lt;a href=\"Ayleid\"&gt;Ayleid&lt;/a&gt;s, the Heartland High Elves that would have none to do with their isle-kind. Where the &lt;a href=\"Altmer\"&gt;Altmer&lt;/a&gt; sought to focus on dracochrysalis, or keeping elder magic bound before it could change into something lesser (and act which ironically required aetherial surplus), the Ayleids harvested castaway creatia from &lt;a href=\"Oblivion%20%28Realm%29\"&gt;Oblivion&lt;/a&gt; by entering a pact with the masters of the &lt;a href=\"Void\"&gt;Void&lt;/a&gt;, the Princes of Misrule.\nGypsy Moth dustmemore insert - it should be noted here that it is always foolish to think of whole races sharing like minds. \"Ayleid\" is as much a metaphysical designation as it is a cultural one. Just like the earliest &lt;a href=\"Chimer\"&gt;Chimer&lt;/a&gt; who orphaned themselves from the &lt;a href=\"Veloth\"&gt;Veloth&lt;/a&gt;i Exodites, but remain Chimer today, large numbers of Ayleids showed more interest in the immediate earthly needs of agriculture rather than the magical needs of concept-farming. This distinction becomes important later, when \"Ayleid\" begins to designate other, and ofttimes foreign, agencies.\nEvery dawnmaker Tower takes a myth-form. &lt;a href=\"Red%20Mountain\"&gt;Red Tower&lt;/a&gt; is a volcano and its surrounds. &lt;a href=\"Snow%20Throat\"&gt;Snow Throat&lt;/a&gt; a mountain whose apex is only half here. &lt;a href=\"Numidium\"&gt;Walk-Brass&lt;/a&gt; is appropriately ambulatory, and (most of the time) anthropomorphic. The Aldmeri polydoxes were cosminachs, and the White-Gold project was and is no different.\nThough the Ayleids gave theirs a central Spire as the imago of &lt;a href=\"Adamantine%20Tower\"&gt;Ada-mantia&lt;/a&gt;, the whole of the polydox resembled the Wheel, with eight lesser towers forming a ring around their primus. To dismiss this mythitecture as being a mockery of the &lt;a href=\"Aurbis\"&gt;Aurbis&lt;/a&gt; is to ignore an important point: this same \"jest\" gave White-Gold Tower a power over creatia unalike any on this plane(t). It was a triumph of sympathetic megafetish, and the Start of the [Threat! To! Empire!] that brings me to this Council.\nIf the Ayleids made their own Wheel within the Wheel, were-web aad semblio, what would happen if they plucked its strings?"}

Both sorceresses foretold doom to King Lysandus, but Lysandus insisted on his decision to fight against Sentinel. Nulfaga retired to &lt;a href=\"Shedungent\"&gt;Shedungent&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;a href=\"Wrothgarian%20Mountains\"&gt;Wrothgarian Mountains&lt;/a&gt; and left Skakmat behind to report to her.\nAlthough Skakmat, with his unnatural fog, tried to avoid the &lt;a href=\"Battle%20of%20Cryngaine%20Field\"&gt;Battle of Cryngaine Field&lt;/a&gt;, eventually as foretold, Lysandus was killed by a Sentinel arrow. Upon learning of this, Nulfaga descended into madness and remained within Shedungent, spending the entirety of her time in magical studies.\nNulfaga was misled into believing that the murderer of her son, Lysandus, was in an unmarked ship travelling from the &lt;a href=\"Imperial%20City\"&gt;Imperial City&lt;/a&gt; to Daggerfall. The ship was, in fact, the ship of the mysterious agent sent by &lt;a href=\"Uriel%20Septim%20VII\"&gt;Uriel Septim VII&lt;/a&gt;. She summoned a storm to swallow and destroy the ship and its passengers, though the agent survived.\nThe agent later visited Nulfaga in Shedungent on behalf of Medora for magical assistance in lifting the curse placed on Direnni Tower. Still in madness however, Nulfaga was unable to help, leaving the agent to search Shedungent alone for the magical ingredient Medora would need to lift the curse herself.\nAfter the agent avenged King Lysandus, her memory was somewhat restored. She helped the agent in the final quest concerning the &lt;a href=\"Numidium\"&gt;Numidium&lt;/a&gt;. She prophesied the wielders of the Numidium."}

Two installments of \u00a0series,\u00a0 and , involve the Numidium as a central element in their stories.\nFirst Numidium (Anumidium).\nThe Numidium was designed by &lt;a href=\"Kagrenac\"&gt;Kagrenac&lt;/a&gt;, a Dwemer &lt;a href=\"Tonal%20Architect\"&gt;Tonal Architect&lt;/a&gt; during the &lt;a href=\"First%20Era\"&gt;First Era&lt;/a&gt;, and was intended to serve as a god of sorts for the Dwemer people. There are many theories that propose that it was built to allow for the mortal plane's transcendence. The original power source was the &lt;a href=\"Heart%20of%20Lorkhan\"&gt;Heart of Lorkhan&lt;/a&gt;, whose power the Dwemer had accessed using Kagrenac's Tools: &lt;a href=\"Keening\"&gt;Keening&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Sunder\"&gt;Sunder&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Wraithguard\"&gt;Wraithguard&lt;/a&gt;. It was first used in the &lt;a href=\"Battle%20of%20Red%20Mountain\"&gt;Battle of Red Mountain&lt;/a&gt;, when &lt;a href=\"Chimer\"&gt;Chimer&lt;/a&gt; forces assailed the Dwemer stronghold and captured it after the mysterious disappearance of the &lt;a href=\"Dwemer\"&gt;Dwemer&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe Numidium was gifted to &lt;a href=\"Tiber%20Septim\"&gt;Tiber Septim&lt;/a&gt; by the &lt;a href=\"Tribunal%20Temple\"&gt;Tribunal&lt;/a&gt; in return for &lt;a href=\"Morrowind\"&gt;Morrowind&lt;/a&gt;'s semi-autonomy during his conquest of &lt;a href=\"Tamriel\"&gt;Tamriel&lt;/a&gt;. The Emperor ordered his Imperial Battlemage, &lt;a href=\"Zurin%20Arctus\"&gt;Zurin Arctus&lt;/a&gt;, to construct a control device known as the &lt;a href=\"Totem%20of%20Tiber%20Septim\"&gt;Totem of Tiber Septim&lt;/a&gt;. The Tribunal did not include the Heart as a power source, due to it being the source of their divine power, so a new one called the &lt;a href=\"Mantella\"&gt;Mantella&lt;/a&gt; was created and infused with Arctus' and &lt;a href=\"Wulfharth\"&gt;another's powerful life energy&lt;/a&gt;. The Numidium was used by Tiber Septim to subjugate all of Tamriel, including the neutral Tamrielic royal families, in an attempt to eliminate anyone not absolutely loyal to his rule. An enraged Zurin Arctus attempted to halt the Emperor's mad conquest, and in the ensuing chaos, the Mantella was lost, and the Numidium was destroyed.\nDuring the events of , the Mantella was recovered and the Numidium was activated by &lt;a href=\"The%20Agent\"&gt;an Agent of the Blades&lt;/a&gt;. As a result, a \"&lt;a href=\"Dragon%20Break\"&gt;Dragon Break&lt;/a&gt;\" (a spacetime &lt;a href=\"wiktionary%3Aanomaly\"&gt;anomaly&lt;/a&gt;) occured. Subsequently, multiple endings of \"Daggerfall\" occured simultaneously: the Kings of &lt;a href=\"Iliac%20Bay\"&gt;Iliac Bay&lt;/a&gt; were defeated, preventing a major war; &lt;a href=\"Orcs\"&gt;Orcs&lt;/a&gt; became citizens of the Empire; &lt;a href=\"Mannimarco\"&gt;Mannimarco&lt;/a&gt;, the King of Worms, became a god; the &lt;a href=\"Underking\"&gt;Underking&lt;/a&gt; was laid to rest; and the Numidium itself was destroyed.\nSecond Numidium (Akulakhan).\nDuring the events of , the second Numidium, named Akulakhan, was a partial reconstruction of the first Numidium and was powered by the Heart of Lorkhan. Its construction was overseen by\u00a0the maddened &lt;a href=\"Dagoth%20Ur%20%28Character%29\"&gt;Dagoth Ur&lt;/a&gt;, whose\u00a0goal was to cover the entirety of the world with his &lt;a href=\"Blight\"&gt;Blight&lt;/a&gt;, a deadly disease that he used to infect, convert, and control the citizens of Morrowind, so that all mortals might be connected to the Heart and thus be controlled by Dagoth Ur.\nHowever, in &lt;a href=\"3E%20427\"&gt;3E 427&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"Nerevarine\"&gt;Nerevarine&lt;/a&gt; arrived in &lt;a href=\"Vvardenfell\"&gt;Vvardenfell&lt;/a&gt; from the &lt;a href=\"Imperial%20City\"&gt;Imperial City&lt;/a&gt; prison and, under the guidance of &lt;a href=\"Vivec\"&gt;Vivec&lt;/a&gt;, recovered &lt;a href=\"Kagrenac%27s%20Tools\"&gt;Kagrenac's Tools&lt;/a&gt; and journeyed to the &lt;a href=\"Red%20Mountain\"&gt;Red Mountain&lt;/a&gt;'s &lt;a href=\"Dagoth%20Ur%20%28Morrowind%20Location%29\"&gt;fortress&lt;/a&gt; to defeat Dagoth Ur. Using the power of the tools, the Nerevarine was able to destroy the enchantments on the Heart, killing Dagoth Ur and destroying Akulakhan."}

Prior to his adventures in Elsweyr, he fought against the magic of the &lt;a href=\"Maormer\"&gt;Maormer&lt;/a&gt; king &lt;a href=\"Orgnum\"&gt;Orgnum&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Sunhold\"&gt;Sunhold&lt;/a&gt;, and was the brother of Sunhold's king. Nurarion was said to have wielded the \"Subtle Blade.\"\nHistory.\nDefending Sunhold.\nDuring the Merethic Era, the city of Sunhold in the &lt;a href=\"Summerset%20Isles\"&gt;Summerset Isles&lt;/a&gt; was under the constant sufferance of storms conjured by the king of the Maormer, Orgnum. To combat the storms, Nurarion led Sunholds mages in performing a counter-spell to ward off the storms. To ensure his success, Nurarion made a deal with the &lt;a href=\"Daedric%20Prince\"&gt;Daedric Prince&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Clavicus%20Vile\"&gt;Clavicus Vile&lt;/a&gt; to give him a voice that could call forth \"a doom greater than any called by Orgnum.\" Characteristic for bargains made with Clavicus Vile, Nurarions newfound power came with a heavy toll: although he was able to end the storm, the power of his voice was so strong that he could not speak without posing a great risk to those around him. His voice was said to \"cut lightning bolts in half and turn mountains to rubble,\" and that only his foes ever heard him speak, and even then, only in whispers. As such, he was exiled, finding himself in &lt;a href=\"Valenwood\"&gt;Valenwood&lt;/a&gt;'s &lt;a href=\"Grahtwood\"&gt;Grahtwood&lt;/a&gt; region communing \"among the buried roots of the Ayleid worms\" in &lt;a href=\"Wormroot%20Depths\"&gt;Wormroot Depths&lt;/a&gt;.\nKhunzar-ri's kra'jun.\nNurarion was found in exile by the &lt;a href=\"Khajiit\"&gt;Khajiit&lt;/a&gt; hero Khunzar-ri, and was the first member of Khunzar-ri's kra'jun formed to combat the dragons that raged across Elsweyr. Knowing that they could not defeat the dragons in direct combat, the kra'jun, consisting also of &lt;a href=\"Anequina%20Sharp-Tongue\"&gt;Anequina Sharp-Tongue&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Cadwell\"&gt;Cadwell&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Flinthild%20Demon-Hunter\"&gt;Flinthild Demon-Hunter&lt;/a&gt;, resolved to trap the dragons where they could do no harm. After the group tricked the dragons into having their strength sapped into &lt;a href=\"Jode%27s%20Core\"&gt;Jode's Core&lt;/a&gt;, Nurarion suggested trapping them in the &lt;a href=\"Halls%20of%20Colossus\"&gt;Halls of Colossus&lt;/a&gt;, which they successfully accomplished.\nDeath and crystal.\nAfter the disbandment of the kra'jun following Khunzar-ri's death, Nurarion used his voice to scream years of range and sorrow into a gem in an unknown cave, said to be only the second time he ever screamed, the first time being to save Sunhold. The power of his voice caused the cave around him to collapse, resulting in his death, although the gem is said to remain undiscovered along with echoes of his power. It has been claimed that the leftover echoes will sunder &lt;a href=\"Anequina\"&gt;Anequina&lt;/a&gt; from &lt;a href=\"Pellitine\"&gt;Pellitine&lt;/a&gt;, or level &lt;a href=\"Rimmen\"&gt;Rimmen&lt;/a&gt; in the blink of an eye."}

The Dragonborn recovers the item after a difficult dungeon quest, only to find it is damaged. Frustrated and disappointed, Nurelion pays the Dragonborn five and takes to his bed, sick. The Dragonborn then talks to Quintus Navale, who intends to tend his master for his final days. Quintus gives the Dragonborn a more reasonable gift for the efforts involved.\nWhen visiting him later he is sleeping in his bed. Attempting to talk to him will result in a message saying \"Nurelion is asleep and dying.\"\nRepairing the phial.\nSometime thereafter, Quintus contacts the Dragonborn, asking for the collection of &lt;a href=\"Alchemy%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;alchemical&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Ingredients%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;ingredients&lt;/a&gt; to help repair the broken phial.

If the White Phial has previously been recovered for Nurelion, he falls ill and is in danger of dying.

This language is said to be difficult to learn for common &lt;a href=\"Tamriel\"&gt;Tamrielic&lt;/a&gt; races.\nDespite the common tales of Nymph seductive nature, they are, in fact, very shy creatures. It takes months to gain one's trust and make her reveal herself. It is said that Nymphs are the wisest and most wonderful creatures in Tamriel. They know more about the behavior and varieties of the deep woodland creatures than the greatest &lt;a href=\"Bosmer\"&gt;Bosmer&lt;/a&gt; scholar."}

He said the place would be full of riches, but I have yet to see even a single gold coin. To make matters worse, I think the other priests are beginning to suspect we aren't who we say we are. If they discover we're posing as priests of &lt;a href=\"Nocturnal\"&gt;Nocturnal&lt;/a&gt;, I'm sure they're not going to simply ask us to leave nicely. I'll have to watch my step.\nAs an \"acolyte of Nocturnal,\" I've been assigned a mentor. Old &lt;a href=\"Dunmer%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;dark elf&lt;/a&gt; fellow by the name of &lt;a href=\"Lythelus\"&gt;Lythelus&lt;/a&gt;. Maybe if I act the part, I can pry some information from him about the &lt;a href=\"Pilgrim%27s%20Path\"&gt;Pilgrim's Path&lt;/a&gt;. Anders swears to me that all of the temple's wealth is stashed within their inner sanctum, which supposedly sits at the end of the path, so my job is to get us through the obstacles alive.\nLythelus was easier to coax than I expected. Gave me a wealth of information on the Pilgrim's Path, but he was speaking in riddles. I'll try to record what I remember here and share it with Anders after he's done with his mentor. The only thing Lythelus seemed clear about was that there were five \"tests\" on the path. This what he said about each:\n\"Shadows of their former selves, sentinels of the dark. They wander ever more and deal swift death to defilers.\"\n\"Above all they stand, vigilance everlasting. Beholden to the murk yet contentious of the glow.\"\n\"Offer what She desires most, but reject the material. For her greatest want is that which cannot be seen, felt or carried.\"\n\"Direct and yet indirect. The path to salvation a route of cunning with fortune betraying the foolish.\"\n\"The journey is complete, the Empress's embrace awaits the fallen. Hesitate not if you wish to gift her your eternal devotion.\"\nHe also mumbled some nonsensical phrases like \"night is the new day\" and how he was the \"ghost of the sun.\" I have no idea what these cryptic sentiments mean, but hopefully during tomorrow's ritual, Anders and I will put everything we've learned to the test."}

The Vestige must help them do so.\nJournal.\n\"The Vinedusk Rangers are under siege by an invading Colovian force. They've offered me a chance to join the fight.\"\nWalkthrough.\nUpon entering Vinedusk Village from the south, you are greeted by &lt;a href=\"Scout%20Mengaer\"&gt;Scout Mengaer&lt;/a&gt; who had just killed a couple of Colovian Troopers. She describes the situation the current situation and how she discovered to mages trying to attack from the side. She then offers the Vestige to help and points the way to &lt;a href=\"Captain%20Odreth\"&gt;Captain Odreth&lt;/a&gt;, who is in the command tree. This is when the quest starts.\nJust keep going straight, and you will head to the command tree. A &lt;a href=\"cooking%20fire\"&gt;cooking fire&lt;/a&gt; and a &lt;a href=\"Hizrabi%27s%20Report\"&gt;note&lt;/a&gt; can be found at the entrance. If you read the note, you will be able to discover &lt;a href=\"Claw%27s%20Strike\"&gt;Claw's Strike&lt;/a&gt;, which is located north of the &lt;a href=\"Maw%20of%20Lorkhaj\"&gt;Maw of Lorkhaj&lt;/a&gt;. After doing that, you should enter the tree.\nWhen you go up the latter, you will find &lt;a href=\"Sergeant%20Herdor\"&gt;Sergeant Herdor&lt;/a&gt; talking with Captain Odreth. You will need to wait before you can talk to the Captain. After the conversation, you will be able to speak to Odreth and inform him of the current situation. He will explain that the Colovians chose an inconvenient time for the Rangers since many of them have traveled all over the Dominion Territories. He would then order the Vestige to help one of his aides to prepare for a two-pronged counterattack. He will then tell the Vestige to talk with &lt;a href=\"Glooredel\"&gt;Glooredel&lt;/a&gt;, who is at the base of the tree. When you get the next objective, you can talk about who the Vinedusk Rangers are, the plan, and the Colovian Invasion. They provide context on the quest and events in Reaper's March.\nWhen you are done, leave the tree and proceed to the next objective. Head northwest from the center and enter the first house that should be in front of you. When you go through it, head to the upper left house and talk to Glooredel. She is grateful that Odreth had sent someone to help and she explains her plan. Since all of the tree homes are connected via a root system, her plan is to burn the roots and the entire settlement using an admixture of &lt;a href=\"Shalk%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Shalk&lt;/a&gt; guts and &lt;a href=\"Fire%20Salts\"&gt;Fire Salts&lt;/a&gt;. She sends the Vestige to every home in the Village to put the admixture into urns of sap that come from the root system and to return to her workshop to light the flames. After receiving the next objective, you can ask about the Village and how it is found, why she is willing to burn the village, and the effects burning the Village would have on the &lt;a href=\"Green%20Pact\"&gt;Green Pact&lt;/a&gt;.\nOnce you are done, head out and go to the other side of the command tree, where a lot of the fighting is. You are going to have to fight a few Highland mercenaries to get to the houses, but earning some Experience would not here. You only have to light five hooms that are not guarded. If you have &lt;a href=\"ESO%20Plus\"&gt;ESO Plus&lt;/a&gt; and your crafting items go to your &lt;a href=\"Craft%20Bag\"&gt;Craft Bag&lt;/a&gt;, then you can collect &lt;a href=\"Provisioning\"&gt;Provisioning&lt;/a&gt; ingredients in the homes you have to burn down, if you do not have ESO Plus and the Craft Bag, then you can still get them, but they will fill up your main inventory. Just follow the markers on the compass, and you will light the homes in no time. After burning the five houses, report back to Glooredel, who is on the other side of town. She will then let you light the last piece of sap needed and move back to avoid any recoil. When you are done, return to Captain Odreth to complete the quest. You can now move on to &lt;a href=\"Down%20the%20Skeever%20Hole\"&gt;Down the Skeever Hole&lt;/a&gt;."}

Since you don't have to pay \"shipping fees\", you old sea-cat, I expect you to cut me a deal next time you're in H. I'll have a new batch waiting for you, so be sure to get me my raw materials.\nBetter keep this short \u2014 I hear you're sailing with the tides. Best of luck and a safe voyage to you!\n\u2014 K"}

Oblivion is the home of a wide variety of &lt;a href=\"Daedra%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Daedra&lt;/a&gt;, many of whom belong exclusively to one or a few planes, or are common across all of Oblivion. The appearance of many of the planes of Oblivion is dependent on the nature of their ruling prince, and are as varied in their nature and hospitableness as the Daedra themselves are. In addition to the major 16 planes of the Daedric Princes, there are said to be well over 37,000 pocket realms within Oblivion.\nColdharbour.\nColdharbour is the plane of Oblivion belonging to &lt;a href=\"Molag%20Bal%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Molag Bal&lt;/a&gt;, the Daedric Prince of schemes and domination, and is a plane of perpetual torment and suffering characterized by barren landscapes, black stone crags and pools of &lt;a href=\"Azure%20Plasm\"&gt;Azure Plasm&lt;/a&gt;. Coldharbour plays a pivotal role in the &lt;a href=\"Main%20Quest%20%28Online%29\"&gt;main quest&lt;/a&gt; of \"Online\", as Molag Bal and his Daedric army invades &lt;a href=\"Tamriel\"&gt;Tamriel&lt;/a&gt; using &lt;a href=\"Dark%20Anchors\"&gt;Dark Anchors&lt;/a&gt; designed to merge the two worlds in a &lt;a href=\"Planemeld\"&gt;Planemeld&lt;/a&gt;; the &lt;a href=\"Vestige\"&gt;Vestige&lt;/a&gt; travels to Coldharbour to confront Molag Bal and stop the invasion, reclaiming their soul in the process.\nThe Deadlands.\nThe Deadlands is the plane of Oblivion belonging to &lt;a href=\"Mehrunes%20Dagon%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Mehrunes Dagon&lt;/a&gt;, the Daedric Prince of destruction and ambition, and is the primary setting of the wherein the Vestige confronts Dagon's armies in an attempt to stop him from enacting a long-planned invasion of Tamriel. The Deadlands is a plane of fire and brimstone, where islands of scorched rock sit upon vast seas of lava and oppressive spires dot the landscape.\nApocrypha.\nApocrypha is the plane of Oblivion belonging to &lt;a href=\"Hermaeus%20Mora%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Hermaeum Mora&lt;/a&gt;, the Daedric Prince of fate and hidden knowledge. It is an expansive library of tomes and scrolls containing dangerous arcanature and maddening esoterica, its many stacks and shelves sitting upon a seemingly endless ocean of coagulant. The Vestige goes to Apocrypha in having entered a pact with Hermaeus Mora to save his plane and, by extension, &lt;a href=\"Nirn\"&gt;Nirn&lt;/a&gt;.\nOther planes.\n&lt;a href=\"Dragonstar%20Arena\"&gt;Attribution's Share&lt;/a&gt;.\nAttribution's Share is the plane of &lt;a href=\"Boethia\"&gt;Boethia&lt;/a&gt;, Daedric Prince of conspiracies and deceit, and is much like the Deadlands in that it is characterized by fire, lava, ash and molten rocks. The Vestige is transported to Attribution's Share during the final trial of Dragonstar Arena were, upon winning, they are named Boethia's champion.\n&lt;a href=\"Evergloam%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Evergloam&lt;/a&gt;.\nEvergloam is the plane of &lt;a href=\"Nocturnal%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Nocturnal&lt;/a&gt;, Daedric Prince of night and mystery which is reflected throughout the plane in a perpetual darkness covered with a purple miasma. The Evergloam is encountered by the Vestige on several occasions: in &lt;a href=\"Crow%27s%20Wood\"&gt;Crow's Wood&lt;/a&gt; accessed from &lt;a href=\"Stonefalls%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Stonefalls&lt;/a&gt;, in the &lt;a href=\"Clockwork%20City%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Clockwork City&lt;/a&gt; during Nocturnal's infiltration, in &lt;a href=\"Exarchs%27%20Egress\"&gt;Exarchs' Egress&lt;/a&gt; accessed from the Clockwork City, in the &lt;a href=\"The%20Shadow%20Cleft%20%28Location%29\"&gt;Shadow Cleft&lt;/a&gt; accessed from the Clockwork City, from &lt;a href=\"Artaeum%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Artaeum&lt;/a&gt; while searching for the &lt;a href=\"Transparent%20Law\"&gt;Heart of Transparent Law&lt;/a&gt;, and in the &lt;a href=\"Garden%20of%20Shadows\"&gt;Garden of Shadows&lt;/a&gt; from &lt;a href=\"Olyve%27s%20Brewery\"&gt;Olyve's Brewery&lt;/a&gt; during the &lt;a href=\"Witches%20Festival\"&gt;Witches Festival&lt;/a&gt;.\n&lt;a href=\"Quagmire%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Quagmire&lt;/a&gt;.\nQuagmire is the plane of &lt;a href=\"Vaermina%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Vaermina&lt;/a&gt;, Daedric Prince of dreams and nightmares. It is a plane reminiscent of Tamriel, but is steeped in a haze of light purple with rolling mist and violet waters. The Vestige is briefly trapped in Quagmire by Vaermina herself after her plan to seize the mind of &lt;a href=\"High%20King%20Emeric%20%28Online%29\"&gt;High King Emeric&lt;/a&gt; is foiled.\n&lt;a href=\"Colored%20Rooms%20%28Online%29\"&gt;The Colored Rooms&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe Colored Rooms is the plane of the Daedric Prince &lt;a href=\"Meridia%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Meridia&lt;/a&gt;, whose spheres of influence are life and light. The Colored Rooms reflects this in its myriad of colored lights and energy in a void of suspended landscapes. The Vestige visits the Colored Rooms twice for brief moments: once when they reclaim their soul from Molag Bal, and once when they defeat the &lt;a href=\"Symphony%20of%20Blades\"&gt;Symphony of Blades&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;a href=\"Depths%20of%20Malatar\"&gt;Depths of Malatar&lt;/a&gt; to claim one half of the &lt;a href=\"Wrathstone\"&gt;Wrathstone&lt;/a&gt;.\n&lt;a href=\"Crystal%20Tower%20%28Online%29\"&gt;The Fields of Regret&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe Fields of Regret is the plane of &lt;a href=\"Clavicus%20Vile\"&gt;Clavicus Vile&lt;/a&gt;, Daedric Prince of bargains and trickery, and is made up of woodland forests populated heavily by &lt;a href=\"Skaafin\"&gt;Skaafin&lt;/a&gt;. The plane is briefly encountered by the Vestige as it begins to intersect the &lt;a href=\"Crystal%20Tower%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Crystal Tower&lt;/a&gt; during Nocturnal's attempt to usurp Transparent Law.\n&lt;a href=\"Hunting%20Grounds%20%28Online%29\"&gt;The Hunting Grounds&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe Hunting Grounds is the plane of &lt;a href=\"Hircine%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Hircine&lt;/a&gt;, the Daedric Prince of the hunt. It is a vast forest filled with many creatures, both ordinary and supernatural, who participate in a perpetual cycle of death and rebirth through hunting and predation. The Vestige visits the Hunting Grounds on several occasions: if they become a &lt;a href=\"Lycanthropy%20%28Online%29\"&gt;werewolf&lt;/a&gt;, in &lt;a href=\"Malabal%20Tor\"&gt;Malabal Tor&lt;/a&gt; when searching for the survivors of an attack in &lt;a href=\"Wilding%20Run\"&gt;Wilding Run&lt;/a&gt;, as a mirror of &lt;a href=\"Bangkorai\"&gt;Bangkorai&lt;/a&gt;'s &lt;a href=\"Fallen%20Grotto\"&gt;Fallen Grotto&lt;/a&gt;, in the &lt;a href=\"March%20of%20Sacrifices\"&gt;March of Sacrifices&lt;/a&gt; during a Great Hunt, in &lt;a href=\"Hunter%27s%20Glade\"&gt;Hunter's Glade&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;a href=\"The%20Rift%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Rift&lt;/a&gt; and in &lt;a href=\"Hunter%27s%20Grotto\"&gt;Hunter's Grotto&lt;/a&gt; accessed from the &lt;a href=\"The%20Reach%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Reach&lt;/a&gt;.\n&lt;a href=\"Maw%20of%20Lorkhaj\"&gt;The Scuttling Void&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe Scuttling Void is the plane of &lt;a href=\"Namira\"&gt;Namira&lt;/a&gt;, Daedric Prince of darkness and decay, and is a place of floating crags amongst a purple-blue versicolor atmosphere. The Vestige enters the Scuttling Void as part of the Maw of Lorkhaj to fight against the &lt;a href=\"dro-m%27Athra\"&gt;dro-m'Athra&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Reaper%27s%20March\"&gt;Reaper's March&lt;/a&gt;.\n&lt;a href=\"Cheesemonger%27s%20Hollow\"&gt;The Shivering Isles&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe Shivering Isles is the plane of &lt;a href=\"Sheogorath\"&gt;Sheogorath&lt;/a&gt;, Daedric Prince of madness and disorder, and it is a realm split between depressive dementia and crazed mania where there is no strict order or predictable nature. The Vestige journeys into a section of the Shivering Isles called Cheesemonger's Hollow in assistance to the spirit of &lt;a href=\"Arch-Mage%20Shalidor\"&gt;Arch-Mage Shalidor&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Mages%20Guild%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Mages Guild&lt;/a&gt; and again when instructed in the use of &lt;a href=\"Volendrung%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Volendrung&lt;/a&gt; by Sheogorath.\n&lt;a href=\"Spiral%20Skein%20%28Online%29\"&gt;The Spiral Skein&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe Spiral Skein is the plane of &lt;a href=\"Mephala%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Mephala&lt;/a&gt;, Daedric Prince of deception and secrets, and her plane is a cavernous tangle of webs accented in darkness and red hues. The Vestige visits the Spiral Skein on several occasions: to rescue an oracle of the Mages Guild, to rescue Meridia's &lt;a href=\"Golden%20Knight\"&gt;Golden Knight&lt;/a&gt;, as part of the &lt;a href=\"Cradle%20of%20Shadows\"&gt;Cradle of Shadows&lt;/a&gt; and while traversing the Crystal Tower as it began to intersect the Spiral Skein among other planes.\nPocket realms.\n&lt;a href=\"Fargrave\"&gt;Fargrave&lt;/a&gt;.\nFargrave is a pocket realm of Oblivion that is unique insofar as it exists where paths between planes are easy to navigate, providing a more centralized and navigable harbor between both the major planes of the Daedric Princes and other pocket realms. The realm itself is not ruled by any one prince or lord, but rather by a group known as the &lt;a href=\"The%20Grasp\"&gt;Grasp&lt;/a&gt; that enforces a &lt;a href=\"Stricture\"&gt;Stricture&lt;/a&gt; to which all Daedra that enter the realm are bound to. The Vestige encounters Fargrave in their efforts against Mehrunes Dagon's plot against Tamriel.\n&lt;a href=\"Lord%20Velian%27s%20Plane\"&gt;Lord Velian's Plane&lt;/a&gt;.\nLord Velian's Plane is a pocket realm of Oblivion created by the &lt;a href=\"Lord%20Velian\"&gt;eponymous&lt;/a&gt; member of the &lt;a href=\"Bloodthorn%20Cult\"&gt;Bloodthorn Cult&lt;/a&gt; that was a reflection of a small part of Tamriel. The Vestige entered the plane and killed Velian after he had performed &lt;a href=\"Necromancy\"&gt;necromantic rituals&lt;/a&gt; to turn the town of &lt;a href=\"Eagle%27s%20Brook%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Eagle's Brook&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Glenumbra%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Glenumbra&lt;/a&gt; into zombies.\n&lt;a href=\"Maelstrom\"&gt;Maelstrom&lt;/a&gt;.\nMaelstrom is a pocket realm of Oblivion ruled by the demiprince &lt;a href=\"Fa-Nuit-Hen\"&gt;Fa-Nuit-Hen&lt;/a&gt;. While the exterior locale of the realm itself is similar to the &lt;a href=\"Alik%27r%20Desert%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Alik'r Desert&lt;/a&gt; in Tamriel, the &lt;a href=\"Maelstrom%20Arena%20%28Location%29\"&gt;Maelstrom Arena&lt;/a&gt; hosts trials with a plethora of themes from marshland to frigid wastes. The Vestige participates in the arena, allowing Fa-Nuit-Hen to remember and restore the barons that had created each of the nine trials.\n&lt;a href=\"The%20Gorge%20%28Location%29\"&gt;The Gorge&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe Gorge is a pocket realm of Oblivion that divides Attribution's Share and the Fields of Regret, the planes of Boethia and Clavicus Vile, respectively. The Vestige visits the Gorge from &lt;a href=\"Cey-Tarn%20Keep\"&gt;Cey-Tarn Keep&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Summerset%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Summerset&lt;/a&gt; while investigating a series of murders.\n&lt;a href=\"Village%20of%20the%20Lost\"&gt;The Village of the Lost&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe Village of the Lost is a pocket realm that sits between Coldharbour and Mundus containing three villages that were pulled out of Mundus during the Planemeld. The Vestige visits the village during their time in Coldharbour after helping to seal tears in the fabric of Oblivion and free the villages' leaders."}
{"id": "1520", "revid": "26213507", "url": "https://elderscrolls.fandom.com/wiki?curid=1520", "title": "Oblivion (Realm)", "text": "Oblivion (also called the Void of Oblivion, the Planes of Oblivion, the Waters of Oblivion, or the Outer Realms), is a collective term used to describe one subset of the planes of existence, inhabited by the &lt;a href=\"Daedra\"&gt;Daedra&lt;/a&gt;.\nCreation.\nOblivion is the portion of the &lt;a href=\"Aurbis\"&gt;Aurbis&lt;/a&gt; mostly created by the &lt;a href=\"Daedric%20Princes\"&gt;Daedric Princes&lt;/a&gt;, those &lt;a href=\"et%27ada\"&gt;et'ada&lt;/a&gt; who did not wish to take part in the creation of &lt;a href=\"Mundus\"&gt;Mundus&lt;/a&gt;, and is frequently used synonymously with the planes of these. These beings created their individual planes of Oblivion out of themselves, possibly in mockery of the Mundus. While most of the realms of Oblivion exist at the will of a Prince, there are some that are sustained by the collective will of an array of &lt;a href=\"lesser%20Daedra\"&gt;lesser Daedra&lt;/a&gt;.\nWhile the vast majority of planes are created by those et'ada who took no part in the creation of Mundus, there are others, namely the &lt;a href=\"Colored%20Rooms\"&gt;Colored Rooms&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"Meridia\"&gt;Meridia&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Ashpit\"&gt;Ashpit&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"Malacath\"&gt;Malacath&lt;/a&gt;, that were created by spirits who are considered Daedra who later became so. Meridia's plane was deliberately created by her, while the method and reason for the creation of Ashpit is unknown, although it is possible that it was created as a prison for Malacath.\nRulers and inhabitants.\nAlmost all known planes of Oblivion are ruled over by one of the Daedric Princes and the plane takes a form reflective of its prince's personality. The native inhabitants of these planes are collectively referred to as &lt;a href=\"Daedra\"&gt;Daedra&lt;/a&gt;, are often created at the whim of the Prince who created the plane, and are not mortal in the traditional sense. If they are killed, especially on the mortal plane, their innate spark of life, what is sometimes called their \"animus,\" returns to a new physical body.\nThose areas of Oblivion not affiliated to a Prince are often called pocket realms, although this term also refers to minor realms affiliated to a prince, the precise relationship of which depends on the nature of each Prince.\nInteractions with Nirn.\nOblivion is visible from Tamriel, and the mortal mind interprets Oblivion as the vast black nothingness of space, literally seeing it as an empty void that is the night sky.\nTravel between Oblivion and Nirn is possible at particular locations, although most of these exist in unsafe locations. There have been a few constructed spaces to facilitate travel between Oblivion and Nirn, often creating liminal spaces between Mundus and Oblivion to ease the transition, called \"slipstream realms\". The most celebrated of these is the &lt;a href=\"Battlespire\"&gt;Battlespire&lt;/a&gt;, used to train Imperial Battlemages. Travel to Oblivion is also possible through the use of &lt;a href=\"Sigil%20Stone\"&gt;Sigil Stone&lt;/a&gt;s.\nThe opening of portals to Oblivion independent of these locations is possible, and is typically achieved through the use of magic inspired by the Daedra themselves.\nIn the &lt;a href=\"Second%20Era\"&gt;Second Era&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Molag%20Bal\"&gt;Molag Bal&lt;/a&gt; attempted to merge &lt;a href=\"Coldharbour\"&gt;Coldharbour&lt;/a&gt; with Mundus, in an event known as the &lt;a href=\"Planemeld\"&gt;Planemeld&lt;/a&gt;.\nAt the end of the &lt;a href=\"Third%20Era\"&gt;Third Era&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Mehrunes%20Dagon\"&gt;Mehrunes Dagon&lt;/a&gt; attempted to come fully into Mundus, in an attempt to claim Tamriel for himself, opening &lt;a href=\"Oblivion%20Gate\"&gt;Oblivion Gate&lt;/a&gt;s between Mundus and &lt;a href=\"Planes%20of%20Oblivion\"&gt;Oblivion&lt;/a&gt; to assist his invasion.\nPhysics.\nGenerally speaking, each plane of Oblivion is a unique, distinct world, with its own natural laws and native inhabitants. They range from the violent and inhospitable &lt;a href=\"Deadlands\"&gt;Deadlands&lt;/a&gt;, to the paradise-like &lt;a href=\"Moonshadow%20%28Location%29\"&gt;Moonshadow&lt;/a&gt;. Not all of these planes take a form that even permits the existence of mortals, though most of those known to Tamriel's scholars have been visited at least once. In addition to those known to be ruled by a Daedric Prince, the powerful &lt;a href=\"Arcane%20University%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;college&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"Imperial%20Battlemage\"&gt;Imperial Battlemage&lt;/a&gt;s has made contact with a number of other realms, and built their training grounds (the &lt;a href=\"Battlespire\"&gt;Battlespire&lt;/a&gt;) in several of these.\nPlanes of the Daedric Princes.\nSeveral Daedric planes are known to exist and are associated with the Daedric Princes. These are:\nAzura's Moonshadow.\nMoonshadow is described as an impossibly beautiful, amazing world made up of impossible shades of colors, and perpetual twilight. This realm is believed to be permanently sealed off from mortals.\nBoethiah's Attribution's Share.\nAlso known at times as Attribution's Share, &lt;a href=\"Boethiah\"&gt;Boethiah&lt;/a&gt;'s plane is made up of vast mazes, gardens and labyrinths, and the architecture has a very twisted and sinister appearance. Betrayal and deception are a matter of natural law in this realm. Tournaments are on occasion held here for mortals to prove themselves.\nClavicus Vile's Fields of Regret.\nThe Fields of Regret appear as a serene countryside dotted with majestic merchant cities, fields of white clovers, woodland meadows, twisted foliage, and odd melted-looking places. The sky is blue with cottony clouds with greenish-grey patches, and the air smells of both perfume and rotting flesh.\nHermaeus Mora's Apocrypha.\nThis is the central repository for all knowledge in the entire universe, the home of Hermaeus Mora. It is said to resemble an infinite library. Murky waters spout tentacles throughout the abyss. Its books are all identical, having black covers and no titles, but there is one of every book ever written, and includes knowledge normally forbidden to &lt;a href=\"Men\"&gt;humans&lt;/a&gt;. Mortals who wander here usually die and remain behind as ghosts, still seeking knowledge.\nHircine's Hunting Grounds.\nThis plane consists of a vast expanse of islands, inhabited by the various &lt;a href=\"Daedra\"&gt;Daedra&lt;/a&gt;, or by vast forests, plains, grasslands and puzzling mazes. Hircine's plane has a higher than normal population of &lt;a href=\"atronach\"&gt;atronach&lt;/a&gt;s, and it is home to were-beasts and creatures much larger than those of &lt;a href=\"Tamriel\"&gt;Tamriel&lt;/a&gt;. The most popular hunted prey are those unlucky mortals who find themselves here accidentally. Mortal souls who have been blessed or rather, cursed with &lt;a href=\"Lycanthropy\"&gt;Lycanthropy&lt;/a&gt; are sent here.\n&lt;a href=\"Malacath\"&gt;Malacath&lt;/a&gt;'s &lt;a href=\"Ashpit\"&gt;Ashpit&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Ashpit\"&gt;Ashpit&lt;/a&gt; is a barren, barely-habitable wasteland. Of those realms accessible by mortals, this is considered the hardest to reach. The realm is described to have no surface and no end. It is filled with particles of ash and smoke, swirling full of curses and broken promises. It is known as the final resting place for &lt;a href=\"Orsimer\"&gt;Orsimer&lt;/a&gt; who live and die honorably, as many orcs are heard making comments such as \"By the Ashpit.\" According to comments made by the Daedric Prince &lt;a href=\"Sheogorath\"&gt;Sheogorath&lt;/a&gt;, this plane has some sort of spine in it, due to his comment that the backbone of Malacath's realm is an actual backbone.\n&lt;a href=\"Mehrunes%20Dagon\"&gt;Mehrunes Dagon&lt;/a&gt;'s &lt;a href=\"Deadlands\"&gt;Deadlands&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Deadlands\"&gt;Deadlands&lt;/a&gt; represent as close to the mortal vision of Hell as any of the Oblivion planes. It is also possibly the best known of all Daedric realms to mortals on &lt;a href=\"Nirn\"&gt;Nirn&lt;/a&gt;. During the &lt;a href=\"Oblivion%20Crisis\"&gt;failed invasion&lt;/a&gt; of Nirn by &lt;a href=\"Mehrunes%20Dagon\"&gt;Dagon's&lt;/a&gt; forces near the end of the Third Era, various Tamrielic forces, especially in &lt;a href=\"Cyrodiil\"&gt;Cyrodiil&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Black%20Marsh\"&gt;Black Marsh&lt;/a&gt;, actually stormed the &lt;a href=\"Deadlands\"&gt;Deadlands&lt;/a&gt; and won victories there. Ash storms and vast seas of lava make up the majority of this realm, which is populated by the highly intelligent &lt;a href=\"Dremora\"&gt;Dremora&lt;/a&gt;, as well as many semi- or non-intelligent beings. The beings include &lt;a href=\"Storm%20Atronach%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;Storm Atronachs&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Flame%20Atronach%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;Flame Atronachs&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Clannfear\"&gt;Clannfear&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Scamp\"&gt;Scamp&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"Daedroth\"&gt;Daedroth&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Xivilai\"&gt;Xivilai&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Spider%20Daedra\"&gt;Spider Daedra&lt;/a&gt;. It is from this realm that &lt;a href=\"Mehrunes%20Dagon\"&gt;Dagon&lt;/a&gt; has attempted to launch his repeated invasions of Nirn. Jagged rocky formations divide the landscape into miniature valleys. People who fall into the cracks in these jagged rocks oftentimes can never escape.\n&lt;a href=\"Meridia\"&gt;Meridia&lt;/a&gt;'s &lt;a href=\"Colored%20Rooms\"&gt;Colored Rooms&lt;/a&gt;.\nLittle is known about this realm, save that the &lt;a href=\"Auroran\"&gt;Auroran&lt;/a&gt; are native to this plane. This is where &lt;a href=\"Umaril\"&gt;Umaril&lt;/a&gt;'s spirit fled when &lt;a href=\"Pelinal%20Whitestrake\"&gt;Pelinal Whitestrake&lt;/a&gt; slew him. The realm is clouded in a thick purple fog and is surrounded by floating rocks and the skies seem to be perpetually lit by stars.\n&lt;a href=\"Molag%20Bal\"&gt;Molag Bal&lt;/a&gt;'s &lt;a href=\"Coldharbour\"&gt;Coldharbour&lt;/a&gt;.\n&lt;a href=\"Molag%20Bal\"&gt;Molag Bal&lt;/a&gt; built his realm to resemble an apocalyptic Nirn, where familiar landmarks appear scorched and ruined. It has been described as what Nirn would look like, were it to undergo centuries of cataclysmic war. Another &lt;a href=\"Imperial%20Palace\"&gt;Imperial Palace&lt;/a&gt; is located in this realm, but it is laden with rotting corpses and dripping with freezing blood. Mortals who make their way here usually end up in the realm's vast, numerous slave pens or charnel houses, bound for eternity as &lt;a href=\"Soul%20Shriven\"&gt;Soul Shriven&lt;/a&gt;. The only untouched region is Atmora, as Molag Bal thought its status as a frozen wasteland was distasteful, and thus it remains as a frozen wasteland. Coldharbour is one of the most inhospitable realms of Oblivion. The sky constantly burns yet the whole realm is beyond freezing. The ground is nothing more than sludge, jagged, rocky formations and ravines and dead, tainted grass. &lt;a href=\"Dremora\"&gt;Dremora&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Daedroth\"&gt;Daedroth&lt;/a&gt;s are known to roam the realm in large numbers, scouring for more slaves.\nColdharbour is habitable by mortals to some degree, as a city controlled by Meridia is located in the realm after her efforts to relocate a Tamrielic city to Coldharbour due to the boundaries between Mundus and Oblivion being weakened and in the mid-Second Era, mortals from Tamriel actually lived there and the city functioned as a normal Tamrielic city, with merchants doing business and even living in houses. However, the city was only there to serve as a base for an assault on Coldharbour by the &lt;a href=\"Fighters%20Guild\"&gt;Fighters&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Mages%20Guild\"&gt;Mages&lt;/a&gt; guilds to stop Molag Bal's Planemeld. It is unknown whether or not the city is still there.\n&lt;a href=\"Namira\"&gt;Namira&lt;/a&gt;'s &lt;a href=\"Scuttling%20Void\"&gt;Scuttling Void&lt;/a&gt;.\nLittle is known of &lt;a href=\"Namira\"&gt;Namira's&lt;/a&gt; realm beyond its name, and that no known mortals have traveled there and returned.\n&lt;a href=\"Nocturnal\"&gt;Nocturnal&lt;/a&gt;'s &lt;a href=\"Evergloam\"&gt;Evergloam&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Evergloam\"&gt;Evergloam&lt;/a&gt; is the mysterious realm of &lt;a href=\"Nocturnal\"&gt;Nocturnal&lt;/a&gt;, and seems to have some connection with the \"luck\" that thieves seem to enjoy. Little is known about Evergloam much like its mistress. The known locations within the Evergloam are the &lt;a href=\"Shade%20Perilous\"&gt;Shade Perilous&lt;/a&gt;, Nocturnal's fortress within her realm, and &lt;a href=\"Crow%27s%20Wood\"&gt;Crow's Wood&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe connection between Nirn and the Evergloam is located in the temple known as the &lt;a href=\"Twilight%20Sepulcher\"&gt;Twilight Sepulcher&lt;/a&gt;. Members of the &lt;a href=\"Nightingales\"&gt;Nightingales&lt;/a&gt; guard this temple during life and death, until Nocturnal deems their contract complete; they are sent to the Evergloam to become one with the shadows.\nThe Daedric artifact known as the &lt;a href=\"Skeleton%20Key\"&gt;Skeleton Key&lt;/a&gt; maintains the connection between Nirn and the Evergloam. Once removed, the portal will close, severing all ties to Nocturnal.\n&lt;a href=\"Peryite\"&gt;Peryite&lt;/a&gt;'s &lt;a href=\"The%20Pits\"&gt;Pits&lt;/a&gt;.\nThis plane is considered to be one of the lowest orders of Oblivion, and is possibly more than one plane. The least of the lesser &lt;a href=\"Daedra\"&gt;Daedra&lt;/a&gt; make their homes here. Little is known of this plane, as it is completely inaccessible to mortals. The closest people have gotten to the Pits were a small band of his worshipers whose spirits were pulled into Oblivion in a botched attempt to summon &lt;a href=\"Peryite\"&gt;Peryite&lt;/a&gt;. However, it is likely that these spirits ended up in &lt;a href=\"Mehrunes%20Dagon\"&gt;Mehrunes Dagon's&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Deadlands\"&gt;Deadlands&lt;/a&gt;, as the plane of Oblivion they were trapped on contained the same superheated red oceans, the same Daedric creatures, and the same dangerous, jagged black rocks. Opposing this hypothesis is the fact that the gate Peryite used to transport a hero to this plane was different in appearance compared to the large, fiery red cat-eye shaped permanent portals of Mehrunes Dagon. This may simply be because a different Daedra opened the gate, or because it was a short term gate. This gate was blue, rectangular, smallish, and bordered with broken lengths of levitating stone or some other substance.\n&lt;a href=\"Sanguine\"&gt;Sanguine&lt;/a&gt;'s &lt;a href=\"Myriad%20Realms%20of%20Revelry\"&gt;Myriad Realms of Revelry&lt;/a&gt;.\nSanguine is said to be in control of tens of thousands of individual, unnamed realms housing all forms of pleasure and decadence. One of these realms is called &lt;a href=\"Misty%20Grove\"&gt;Misty Grove&lt;/a&gt;; it resembles a pleasant woodland clearing with a campfire, where revelers gather, drink alcohol and sing. This is part of the quest \"&lt;a href=\"A%20Night%20to%20Remember%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;A Night to Remember&lt;/a&gt;.\"\n&lt;a href=\"Sheogorath\"&gt;Sheogorath&lt;/a&gt;'s &lt;a href=\"The%20Madhouse\"&gt;Madhouse&lt;/a&gt; (&lt;a href=\"Shivering%20Isles\"&gt;Shivering Isles&lt;/a&gt;).\n&lt;a href=\"The%20Madhouse\"&gt;The Madhouse&lt;/a&gt;, like its master, has a split personality. One half of this realm appears cheery and lighthearted, but hides a &lt;a href=\"Mania\"&gt;deeper manic undercurrent&lt;/a&gt;. The other half is more obviously sinister, representing Sheogorath's &lt;a href=\"Dementia\"&gt;demented side&lt;/a&gt;. This is one of the few realms that has permanent mortal inhabitants. Each division is ruled by a duke or duchess. Main cities in the Shivering Isles include &lt;a href=\"New%20Sheoth\"&gt;New Sheoth&lt;/a&gt;, Bliss, the &lt;a href=\"Crucible\"&gt;Crucible&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Passwall%20%28Shivering%20Isles%29\"&gt;Passwall&lt;/a&gt;.\n&lt;a href=\"Vaermina\"&gt;Vaermina&lt;/a&gt;'s &lt;a href=\"Quagmire\"&gt;Quagmire&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Quagmire\"&gt;Quagmire&lt;/a&gt; is the source of all nightmare and terror. Mortals on this realm describe scenes of impossible horror, which change every few minutes with a blinding flash of lightning into ever more horrifying visions. Mortals in the midst of a nightmare are frequently brushing against the edges of this realm.\nOther planes of Oblivion.\n&lt;a href=\"Chimera%20of%20Desolation\"&gt;Chimera of Desolation&lt;/a&gt;.\nThis realm, the last of the Oblivion realms in the &lt;a href=\"Battlespire\"&gt;Battlespire&lt;/a&gt;, was created by &lt;a href=\"Mehrunes%20Dagon\"&gt;Mehrunes Dagon&lt;/a&gt; to punish a mortal conjurer.\n&lt;a href=\"Infernace\"&gt;Infernace&lt;/a&gt;.\nAn extremely hot realm consisting of molten rock and lava. It is the home of the &lt;a href=\"Flame%20Atronach\"&gt;Flame Atronach&lt;/a&gt;s.\n&lt;a href=\"Mankar%20Camoran\"&gt;Mankar Camoran&lt;/a&gt;'s &lt;a href=\"Paradise%20%28Location%29\"&gt;Paradise&lt;/a&gt;.\n&lt;a href=\"Mankar%20Camoran\"&gt;Mankar Camoran&lt;/a&gt;, using instructions left by &lt;a href=\"Mehrunes%20Dagon\"&gt;Mehrunes Dagon&lt;/a&gt;, created his own personal plane of Oblivion; &lt;a href=\"Gaiar%20Alata\"&gt;Gaiar Alata&lt;/a&gt;, which appeared outwardly to be an idyllic garden realm, but hid a number of torture chambers and other forms of punishment in the underground areas. Here, Camoran's followers in life are given immortality in this afterlife, but they live only to be preyed on and tormented by Camoran and his Daedric allies.\n&lt;a href=\"Ideal%20Masters\"&gt;Ideal Masters&lt;/a&gt;' &lt;a href=\"Soul%20Cairn\"&gt;Soul Cairn&lt;/a&gt;.\nThis is an unaligned plane of Oblivion, also used as part of the &lt;a href=\"Battlespire\"&gt;Battlespire&lt;/a&gt;. It is inhabited primarily by the &lt;a href=\"undead\"&gt;undead&lt;/a&gt;, including an odd race called the Gem Vampires which control the realm. Additionally, the lords of this realm of Oblivion are also called the &lt;a href=\"Ideal%20Masters\"&gt;Ideal Masters&lt;/a&gt;. The Masters are known to make deals with &lt;a href=\"necromancer\"&gt;necromancer&lt;/a&gt;s, at a price not to be bargained for. Mortal souls used in black soul gems are sent to the Soul Cairn, where their spirits wander unaware of time or self.\n&lt;a href=\"Takubar\"&gt;Takubar&lt;/a&gt;.\nAn extremely cold realm, said to change the very composition of the beings within, creating rare phenomena seen nowhere else. The &lt;a href=\"Cold-Flame%20Atronach\"&gt;Cold-Flame Atronach&lt;/a&gt;s are said to have been created here.\nOblivion Barriers.\nFor the most part, the planes of Oblivion are remote and distant, metaphysically, relative to Nirn. While it is physically possible for inhabitants of certain realms to travel to Nirn and for &lt;a href=\"mortal\"&gt;mortal&lt;/a&gt;s to enter certain Oblivion planes, it is extremely difficult. In particular, the princes themselves are generally barred from entering Nirn, though they seem to have no problem crossing between Oblivion realms.\nThe most common means of crossing the boundary between Oblivion and Nirn is by conjuration magic. This allows a mage on Nirn to summon a &lt;a href=\"Daedra\"&gt;Daedra&lt;/a&gt; from one of the Oblivion planes, and bind it to his will, for some period of time. In some cases, the Daedra arrives bodily on Nirn; in other cases, the Daedra's essence is bound into an item, such as armor or a weapon, for use by the conjurer. Rarely, a truly powerful magician can permanently bind a Daedra to an enchanted item, but typically, the item vanishes once the Daedra's conjuration ends. Extremely powerful mages can also transport themselves to the Oblivion planes; in addition, the Daedric Princes can, in some situations, bring a mortal to their realm. This works much the same as with summoning Daedra to Nirn. If a mortal is transported bodily to an Oblivion plane, they can die just like they would on the mortal plane. If they are drawn into the realm magically, it usually involves their body remaining on Nirn, and their death is no more permanent than the death of a summoned Daedra.\nIn the early centuries of Tamriel's history, Daedric Princes commonly walked on Nirn. Certain Daedric Princes played pivotal roles in the development of the early races of &lt;a href=\"man\"&gt;man&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"mer\"&gt;mer&lt;/a&gt;. Azura was responsible for teaching the Chimer to be different from the Altmer (and subsequently cursing the Chimer into the Dunmer). She also created the Khajiit from the Bosmer. Boethiath was indirectly responsible for creating the Orsimer by consuming Trinimac. Near the beginning of the &lt;a href=\"First%20Era\"&gt;First Era&lt;/a&gt;, after the &lt;a href=\"Ayleid\"&gt;Ayleid&lt;/a&gt; slave wars were over, the Aedra made a pact with &lt;a href=\"Alessia\"&gt;Alessia&lt;/a&gt; to prevent Daedra from manifesting on Nirn. Since the Aedra's planes sit between Oblivion and Nirn, they were able to erect barriers that kept the Daedra away from Nirn, unless summoned by someone from the mortal &lt;a href=\"Nirn\"&gt;side&lt;/a&gt;. After this, only a few very rare locations existed where mortals could travel to Oblivion, and the Daedric Princes were forced to communicate with their followers via their &lt;a href=\"Daedric%20Shrines\"&gt;shrines&lt;/a&gt;, and never in person.\nAfter the &lt;a href=\"Oblivion%20Crisis\"&gt;Oblivion Crisis&lt;/a&gt;, however, the joined blood of &lt;a href=\"Martin%20Septim\"&gt;Martin Septim&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Akatosh\"&gt;Akatosh&lt;/a&gt; strengthened the barriers; so now the &lt;a href=\"Dragonfires\"&gt;Dragonfires&lt;/a&gt; do not need to be lit to keep the barriers intact. Many believed that this would permanently sever Oblivion from Nirn as a shrine or a &lt;a href=\"mortal\"&gt;mortal&lt;/a&gt; summoning is required to commune with the Daedra.\nDuring the &lt;a href=\"Fourth%20Era\"&gt;Fourth Era&lt;/a&gt;, 200 years after the Oblivion Crisis, the barriers are apparently weaker. Daedric Princes and high end Daedra are physically manifesting on Nirn. Some manage this through use of a portal of sorts like &lt;a href=\"Nocturnal\"&gt;Nocturnal&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Ebonmere\"&gt;Ebonmere&lt;/a&gt;. Some high-end Daedra such as &lt;a href=\"Clavicus%20Vile\"&gt;Clavicus Vile&lt;/a&gt;'s dog &lt;a href=\"Barbas\"&gt;Barbas&lt;/a&gt; are able to manifest and live on Nirn, Hermaeus Mora was able to manifest himself through a &lt;a href=\"Black%20Book\"&gt;Black Book&lt;/a&gt;, and even &lt;a href=\"Sanguine\"&gt;Sanguine&lt;/a&gt; himself manifested under a mortal &lt;a href=\"Sam%20Guevenne\"&gt;guise&lt;/a&gt;."}

The Oblivion Crisis is noted as being a significant event in Tamrielic history, as it marks the final days of the &lt;a href=\"Third%20Era\"&gt;Third Era&lt;/a&gt; and the end of the &lt;a href=\"Septim%20Dynasty\"&gt;Septim Dynasty&lt;/a&gt;.\nOverview.\nThe conflict was sparked by the assassination of Emperor &lt;a href=\"Uriel%20Septim%20VII\"&gt;Uriel Septim VII&lt;/a&gt; and his known heirs in 3E 433 at the hands of the &lt;a href=\"Mythic%20Dawn\"&gt;Order of the Mythic Dawn&lt;/a&gt;, a cult devoted to the worship of Daedric Prince &lt;a href=\"Mehrunes%20Dagon\"&gt;Mehrunes Dagon&lt;/a&gt;. Dagon had conspired to conquer all of &lt;a href=\"Nirn\"&gt;Nirn&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Mundus\"&gt;Mundus&lt;/a&gt;, aided by &lt;a href=\"Mankar%20Camoran\"&gt;Mankar Camoran&lt;/a&gt;, the leader of the Mythic Dawn.\nNormally, the realms of Oblivion and Mundus are divided by a magical barrier that is impassable by both &lt;a href=\"Daedra\"&gt;Daedra&lt;/a&gt; and mortals. The barrier only exists with the presence of a Septim on the Throne of Cyrodiil and while the &lt;a href=\"Dragonfires\"&gt;Dragonfires&lt;/a&gt; are burning. With the last Septim Emperor and his only three heirs dead, however, Dagon was granted a means of access to the mortal world via the &lt;a href=\"Oblivion%20Gate%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;Oblivion Gates&lt;/a&gt; and was able to enter onto Nirn along with the &lt;a href=\"Daedric%20Forces%20of%20Destruction\"&gt;Daedric Forces of Destruction&lt;/a&gt; to invade Tamriel.\nThe task of combating the Daedra and the Mythic Dawn fell to Uriel Septim's last surviving son, &lt;a href=\"Martin%20Septim\"&gt;Martin Septim&lt;/a&gt;, as well as his companion known as \"The &lt;a href=\"Hero%20of%20Kvatch\"&gt;Hero of Kvatch&lt;/a&gt;.\" Together, Martin and the Hero recovered the &lt;a href=\"Amulet%20of%20Kings\"&gt;Amulet of Kings&lt;/a&gt; from Mankar Camoran and the Mythic Dawn. The Amulet was a divine artifact required to rekindle the Dragonfires and restore the barriers between the two realms.\nThe Oblivion Crisis devastated all the provinces of Tamriel, but the main theater in which it took place was the Imperial province of Cyrodiil. &lt;a href=\"Kvatch\"&gt;One city&lt;/a&gt; was entirely destroyed and several others left in ruin over the course of the Crisis. Eventually, the Hero recovered the Amulet of Kings from Camoran. Martin defeated Mehrunes Dagon in the Battle of the Imperial City and sealed the Gates of Oblivion, thus ending the Crisis and preventing the Daedra from ever starting another invasion.\nBackground.\nThe Oblivion Crisis started mostly due to the works of Mankar Camoran, who set the stage for the invasion to commence. Camoran, learning that Dagon planned to attack and needed the magical barriers removed, immediately went to work on a plan to kill the emperor and all his heirs, darkening the Dragonfires for the first time in centuries. The Mythic Dawn, fanatical worshipers of Dagon, acted as the Daedra Lord's earthly agency, and they prepared for his coming, setting the stage for the conflict.\nThe assassinations.\nThe Mythic Dawn proceeded to launch an attack against the royal family. The emperor's three heirs, Geldall, Enman, and Ebel Septim were slain before any attempt could be made to protect them. Concern immediately rose for the life of Emperor Uriel Septim, and his safety was made top priority. The emperor's organization of bodyguards, the &lt;a href=\"Blades\"&gt;Blades&lt;/a&gt;, planned to take Uriel into hiding.\nThe Blades arranged for Uriel Septim to be spirited out of the Imperial City before any assassination attempt could be made. Three Blades, led by Captain Renault, took the Emperor away from the palace and down an underground, secret escape route within one of the city's prison cells. At the start of the escape route however, they were met by an unlikely obstacle: The cell that housed the secret entrance was mistakenly occupied by a &lt;a href=\"Hero%20of%20Kvatch\"&gt;prisoner&lt;/a&gt;. As they passed through, Uriel stopped to look at the prisoner, and declared that they had a great role to play in the coming events. Uriel asked the prisoner to come with them.\nThe group left the prison and entered the tunnels beneath the Imperial City. They were unfortunate in that the &lt;a href=\"Mythic%20Dawn\"&gt;Mythic Dawn&lt;/a&gt; had caught up with them, and they were ambushed repeatedly as they made their escape. During the first ambush, Renault was slain, and Glenroy, another Blade, took point. Glenroy led them further along the passages until at last, in a passage called the Sanctum, the Mythic Dawn were successful in trapping them.\nWhile his guards fought desperately, Uriel turned to the prisoner and handed him the Amulet of Kings off his own neck. The emperor told the prisoner to seek out &lt;a href=\"Jauffre%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;Jauffre&lt;/a&gt;, the Grandmaster of the Blades, who knew the location of the fourth and final heir. \"Find him,\" said the emperor, \"and close shut the Jaws of Oblivion!\" At that moment, an assassin appeared from a secret entrance and stabbed Uriel Septim VII, killing him. Before the assassin could kill the prisoner, Baurus, the last surviving Blade of the group, came and killed the assassin. Baurus mourned his emperor, then listened to the prisoner's story and sent him off to find Jauffre.\nKvatch.\nThe Mythic Dawn, having succeeded in their first mandate of killing the emperor, now went to work on their second: the opening of the Oblivion Gates that would allow Dagon's forces to attack. This began at the Cyrodilic city of Kvatch.\nThe assault on Kvatch was both a way of opening the war and a method of killing the final heir, who was staying in the same city. The Mythic Dawn launched the attack at night, opening three Oblivion Gates in front of Kvatch. Dagon's Daedric armies swarmed the city, and yet the three lesser Gates were just the beginning. The Dawn then opened a Great Oblivion Gate, a massive doorway which allowed Dagon's Daedric Siege Crawler to emerge. The Siege Crawler laid waste to Kvatch, setting the city on fire and destroying most of its buildings.\nBy the end of the assault, few were left alive. Those that survived either managed to escape the city, or were holed up in the Chapel of Akatosh. When it was over and Kvatch was burned, the Daedra occupied the city. The Siege Crawler retreated into the Great Gate, which was closed along with two of the lesser Oblivion gates. The Mythic Dawn left one gate open in front of the city's gate to prevent any attempt at it being retaken by what was left of the Kvatch guard, led by Captain &lt;a href=\"Savlian%20Matius\"&gt;Savlian Matius&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe heir, however, was not dead. Martin Septim had managed to reach the safety of the Chapel but was closed in by the Daedra. He was to be rescued by an unlikely hero. The prisoner, who had reached Jauffre at Weynon Priory near the city of &lt;a href=\"Chorrol\"&gt;Chorrol&lt;/a&gt;, had learned that Martin was a priest in Kvatch and set out to recover him. Upon arriving at Kvatch, the prisoner learned the story of the attack and was told that Martin was trapped alongside others within the city. The prisoner then decided to work with Captain Matius to lift the siege by somehow destroying the Oblivion Gate that still blocked the way into Kvatch.\nThe prisoner proceeded to enter the Gate seeking a way to close it, taking the fight to Oblivion itself. Within the Gate, the prisoner faced a great deal of resistance but was eventually successful in taking the Gate's Sigil Stone, which was the object that anchored the Gate to the mortal world. The removal of the Sigil Stone caused the Gate to be destroyed, and the prisoner went on with Matius and his troops to save the citizens in the Chapel and retake Castle Kvatch. With the victory at Kvatch, the Daedra suffered their first defeat, and the prisoner found Martin. After a short discussion, Martin agreed to accompany the prisoner to Weynon Priory and Jauffre.\nWhen he learned of this turn of events, Mankar Camoran made the death of Martin the top priority of the Mythic Dawn. He also ordered an assault on Weynon Priory, during which the Amulet of Kings, left in Jauffre's care, was stolen. Weynon Priory was saved from total ruin by the arrival of Martin and the prisoner. Upon learning of Martin's safety, Jauffre led them both to Cloud Ruler Temple, the fortress, and headquarters of the Blades. At this point, the Mythic Dawn began opening Oblivion Gates all across Tamriel. The Oblivion Crisis had begun.\nHunting the Mythic Dawn.\nWhile Martin was getting settled at Cloud Ruler Temple, the prisoner, who became known as the &lt;a href=\"Hero%20of%20Kvatch\"&gt;Hero of Kvatch&lt;/a&gt;, worked with Baurus in the Imperial City to track down the emperor's assassins, whom Baurus had identified as the Mythic Dawn. The Hero managed to get hold of three of the four copies of the \"Commentaries on the Mysterium Xarxes\", a Mythic Dawn compendium written by Mankar Camoran. The fourth volume was received when Baurus and the Hero proved victorious over Mankar's son and lieutenant, Raven Camoran, in a skirmish in the Imperial City sewers. With those four volumes, the Hero was able to divine the location of the Mythic Dawn's hidden base and Shrine to Mehrunes Dagon.\nThe Hero infiltrated the Mythic Dawn's secret shrine and there witnessed Mankar Camoran leave the mortal world for his own personal realm of Oblivion, Paradise. Camoran took with him the Amulet of Kings, making it impossible to retrieve through ordinary means. He left behind the \"&lt;a href=\"Mysterium%20Xarxes\"&gt;Mysterium Xarxes&lt;/a&gt;\", the magical and Holy Book of the Mythic Dawn, which was written by Mehrunes Dagon himself. The Hero took the Xarxes, and was forced to fight his way out of the shrine, taking down many Mythic Dawn members, including Mankar's daughter and second in command, Ruma Camoran. With the Xarxes in hand, the Hero returned to Cloud Ruler Temple. Martin began to study the Xarxes for a way to enter Camoran's Paradise and recover the Amulet of Kings.\nAt the same time, the Mythic Dawn increased their productivity, opening dozens of Oblivion Gates in Cyrodiil and the other provinces, including Gates outside every major city in Tamriel. Dagon's forces began invading in earnest, and the Empire was hard pressed to retaliate.\nOther fronts.\nThough the war's main theater was in Cyrodiil, the other provinces came under attack as well, albeit to a somewhat lesser degree. Not much is known about the Oblivion Crisis in the other provinces, though two of them, &lt;a href=\"Morrowind\"&gt;Morrowind&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Skyrim\"&gt;Skyrim&lt;/a&gt;, were mentioned as being hit hard. Reports from Skyrim indicated massive numbers of Daedra overwhelming the natives.\nMorrowind was also endangered, though more due to infighting than the number of Daedra. The political &lt;a href=\"Great%20House\"&gt;Great House&lt;/a&gt;s &lt;a href=\"House%20Hlaalu\"&gt;Hlaalu&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"House%20Dres\"&gt;Dres&lt;/a&gt; attacked the Dunmer of &lt;a href=\"House%20Indoril\"&gt;House Indoril&lt;/a&gt;. The Nords of Skyrim besieged Morrowind's House Redoran territory. Things were further complicated by the disappearance of two powerful Morrowind figures. Lord &lt;a href=\"Vivec\"&gt;Vivec&lt;/a&gt;, the last Living God of the &lt;a href=\"Tribunal\"&gt;Tribunal&lt;/a&gt;, mysteriously vanished, and the &lt;a href=\"Nerevarine\"&gt;Nerevarine&lt;/a&gt;, the Hero of Morrowind, left on an expedition to &lt;a href=\"Akavir\"&gt;Akavir&lt;/a&gt;. Ultimately, House Redoran took the largest blow from the Crisis in the &lt;a href=\"Fall%20of%20Ald%27ruhn\"&gt;Fall of Ald'ruhn&lt;/a&gt;, the destruction of the main location of House Redoran. According to House Redoran, the Empire also withdrew virtually all of its forces from Morrowind in order to defend Cyrodiil, leaving the Dunmer defenseless. This caused a lot of resentment among the Dunmer, with many continuing to hold hatred for the Empire. However, in reality the Empire never withdrew the Legions, as Cyrodiil was left to fend for itself during the Oblivion Crisis. Morrowind had always only held a small Legion force, which could not count on reinforcements from Cyrodiil, and were already considered to be poorly equipped during the Vvardenfell Crisis.\nA different story was in evidence in the province of &lt;a href=\"Black%20Marsh\"&gt;Black Marsh&lt;/a&gt;, however. The &lt;a href=\"Argonians\"&gt;Argonians&lt;/a&gt; rallied to combat the Daedra, led by a political faction called the &lt;a href=\"An-Xileel\"&gt;An-Xileel&lt;/a&gt;. The Argonians defended their land, managing even to take the battle into Oblivion; they struck with such ferocity that the Daedra themselves were forced to close many of their own Gates. Black Marsh was held until the end of the war, bringing the An-Xileel to great prominence.\nAt the time of the Crisis, Daedra worship had become prominent in the &lt;a href=\"Summerset%20Isles\"&gt;Summerset Isles&lt;/a&gt;. A boycott of Imperial goods was already in progress when the Daedra struck. Summerset Isle was plagued by hordes of Daedra, and the Crystal Tower stood as the Altmer's last bastion of hope and thus housed many refugees fleeing the violence. Daedra surrounded the tower and after a few days launched a massacre that led to the slaughter of many elves and the eventual collapse of the Crystal Tower.\nThe Ritual quests.\nAt Jauffre's orders, the Hero tracked down two Mythic Dawn spies that were operating out of Bruma. Intelligence gathered from these spies revealed that the Mythic Dawn were aware of Martin's presence at Cloud Ruler Temple and planned to attack Bruma in an effort to kill him. Not long afterward, an Oblivion Gate opened in front of Bruma. The Hero worked with the Bruma guard and Captain &lt;a href=\"Burd\"&gt;Burd&lt;/a&gt; of Bruma to close the Oblivion Gate. Foreseeing that the Mythic Dawn would launch an even greater assault later, Jauffre tasked the Hero with gaining allies from the other cities of Cyrodiil to aid in &lt;a href=\"Defense%20of%20Bruma%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;Bruma's defense&lt;/a&gt;.\nMartin, meanwhile, was able to discern a method of following Mankar Camoran into his Paradise. In order to create a portal to Paradise, Martin required four objects of power: The Blood of a Daedra Lord, the Blood of a Divine, a Great Welkynd Stone, and lastly a &lt;a href=\"Great%20Sigil%20Stone%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;Great Sigil Stone&lt;/a&gt;. The Hero quested for these items, receiving a Daedric artifact from one of Daedric Princes and succeeding where others had failed in cleansing the Shrine of Sancre Tor, a Blades pilgrimage site (to the Divines) that had fallen under the thrall of evil. After the Hero got the Great Welkynd Stone from the Ayleid ruins of Miscarcand, Martin revealed that the Great Sigil Stone could only be obtained from a Great Oblivion Gate. Thus, they would have to allow the Mythic Dawn to proceed with their plan to attack Bruma.\nThe Battle of Bruma.\nThe Hero went to all the cities of Cyrodiil, and parlayed troops from closing the Gates that threatened the cities. When at last Bruma was as well defended as it could be, Martin, the Hero, and their Cyrodilic army marched into battle against the Daedric Forces.\nThe Second Battle of Bruma was fought then and was the largest engagement against the Daedra to that point. The soldiers managed to hold off the Daedric charge long enough for the Hero of Kvatch to enter the &lt;a href=\"Great%20Gate\"&gt;Great Gate&lt;/a&gt; when it opened. Passing into the Oblivion plane beyond, the Hero fought their way to the Sigil Tower and took the Great Sigil Stone. The Great Gate was closed even as the monstrous Siege Crawler emerged from it. The Siege Crawler was destroyed and the Daedra were all defeated. The Empire had won a powerful victory and with the final component for the portal ritual in hand, Martin opened a portal to Camoran's Paradise, which the Hero entered in pursuit of the Amulet of Kings.\nThe Death of Mankar Camoran.\nIn Paradise, the Hero had to fight their way through the utopian setting of Camoran's realm. While there, the Hero was constantly confronted by the voice of Mankar Camoran, who told him, among other things, that Dagon's invasion was justified, that Tamriel was in truth another realm of Oblivion, and Dagon sought to liberate it.\nIn the Forbidden Grotto, the Hero received help in the form of Eldamil, a former lieutenant of Mankar Camoran's that had had a change of heart and now wanted to make up for his past actions. Together, the Hero and Eldamil escaped the Forbidden Grotto and confronted Mankar Camoran.\nThe fight against Camoran was difficult, due in part to Ruma and Raven Camoran, who had been resurrected by the power of Paradise. But the Hero was victorious; Mankar Camoran was killed. At his death, Paradise crumbled, and the Hero was transported back to Cloud Ruler Temple with the Amulet of Kings. With the Mythic Dawn defeated, Martin and the Hero turned their sights to the Imperial City, where the Dragonfires were waiting.\nThe Defeat of Mehrunes Dagon.\nIn the Imperial City, Martin and the Hero appeared before &lt;a href=\"High%20Chancellor%20Ocato\"&gt;High Chancellor Ocato&lt;/a&gt;, who acted as regent in the Emperor's absence. No sooner had Ocato accepted Martin's claim to the Dragon Throne than a messenger reported the Imperial City was under attack. Oblivion Gates had appeared inside the walls. The capital was burning.\nIn the fighting that followed, Martin, the Hero, and Ocato made their way to the &lt;a href=\"Temple%20of%20the%20One\"&gt;Temple of the One&lt;/a&gt;, where the Dragonfires were. There, they beheld the true form of Mehrunes Dagon, as he emerged from Oblivion to take part in this last, desperate fight. At first, it seemed that all hope was gone; Dagon's appearance meant that the barriers between worlds were completely obliterated. But Martin was struck by an idea and asked the Hero to get him past Dagon. The Hero did so, and in the Temple, Martin bade the Hero farewell and ran to the Dragonfires.\nAt that moment, the Temple dome collapsed, and Dagon stepped inside. But Martin shattered the Amulet of Kings, and in a great burst of flame, the Dragonfires transformed him into a flaming dragon: the Avatar of Akatosh. In the Temple of the One, the Dragon and Daedric Prince struggled, Aedra versus Daedra, until at last the Dragon cast Dagon back into Oblivion. At that moment, every Oblivion Gate was closed, and the magical wards against the invading Daedra were restored. In the Temple, the dragon turned to stone, and the Oblivion Crisis was over.\nAftermath.\nFollowing the final battle, the Empire was left without an Emperor. Martin had no heir, and so the throne lay empty. But the dire need for an Emperor was gone, the Gates of Oblivion were sealed forever, and the Daedra could never attack Tamriel again. The Hero of Kvatch, for the services rendered during the Crisis, was declared the &lt;a href=\"Champion%20of%20Cyrodiil\"&gt;Champion of Cyrodiil&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe Septim Empire, bereft of its god-blessed dynasty, fell on hard times after the Crisis' end. Political and cultural wounds left by the war would continue to fester long after the Crisis abated. In particular, the secession of Black Marsh and the subsequent fall of Morrowind left the east in doubt. Tamriel would enter a state of disarray not seen since the fall of the &lt;a href=\"Potentate\"&gt;Potentate&lt;/a&gt;s and the &lt;a href=\"Second%20Empire\"&gt;Second Empire&lt;/a&gt;. But the majority of the empire would be restored under &lt;a href=\"Titus%20Mede%20I\"&gt;Titus Mede&lt;/a&gt;, using conquest to re-establish control.\nTactics.\nThe main tactic of the Daedra and the Mythic Dawn seemed to be the opening of Oblivion Gates and the attacks on the cities of Tamriel. In the wilderness, Oblivion Gates were opened to allow Daedric creatures to menace the countryside. Dagon and the Mythic Dawn focused their attention on the major cities, using the Daedric Siege Engine to lay waste to them. Currently, the only times known where this has been used were Kvatch and Bruma. Beyond that, the evil forces focused all their power on killing Martin and ending the Septim bloodline. Had they succeeded, the Crisis no doubt would have been even more destructive.\nOn the other hand, the Empire, having no knowledge of how exactly to defeat the Daedra, did the best they could to hold off the attacks. Though Oblivion Gates were closed, there seemed to be no permanent way of ending the Crisis. The rulers of cities commanded their guards to remain in the walls in the event of an attack, and by the midpoint of the war, the entire Imperial Legion was fully committed to the provinces. It was not until Martin's public appearance that victory seemed possible.\nBattles and Conflicts.\nWhile little is known of battles in the other provinces, in Cyrodiil there were many clashes between the Empire and the Daedra with their Mythic Dawn allies. They are as follows (major conflicts in bold):\nBlack Marsh.\nIn addition, there were numerous occasions where Oblivion Gates in the wilderness were entered, as well as the Hero's closing of the Gates outside of all Cyrodiil's cities."}

Oblivion Gates are used to transport large troops of Daedra into Mundus to act as invasion forces, often being summoned outside major cities and other settlements. Oblivion Gates have notably been employed in two major Daedric conquests of &lt;a href=\"Tamriel\"&gt;Tamriel&lt;/a&gt;, those being &lt;a href=\"Molag%20Bal\"&gt;Molag Bal&lt;/a&gt;'s &lt;a href=\"Second%20Era\"&gt;Second Era&lt;/a&gt; invasion, the &lt;a href=\"Planemeld\"&gt;Planemeld&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Mehrunes%20Dagon\"&gt;Mehrunes Dagon&lt;/a&gt;'s &lt;a href=\"Third%20Era\"&gt;Third Era&lt;/a&gt; invasion, the &lt;a href=\"Oblivion%20Crisis\"&gt;Oblivion Crisis&lt;/a&gt;.\nHistory.\nOblivion Crisis.\nThe Oblivion Crisis saw an extensive use of Oblivion Gates, being summoned outside major cities in &lt;a href=\"Cyrodiil\"&gt;Cyrodiil&lt;/a&gt; to allow for Mehrunes Dagon's footsoldiers to pass from the &lt;a href=\"Deadlands\"&gt;Deadlands&lt;/a&gt; into Mundus, where they would lay siege to cities. Dagon's Oblivion Gates take the shape of the &lt;a href=\"Daedric%20Alphabet\"&gt;Daedric&lt;/a&gt; letter Oht (), being filled in with an orange portal. The summoning of Oblivion Gates causes the nearby sky to turn blood-red and causes several Daedric flora to spawn in the general vicinity of the portal, killing native Tamrielic &lt;a href=\"plants\"&gt;plants&lt;/a&gt;.\nAn Oblivion Gate can be closed by sending in an adventurer to enter the portal and remove the &lt;a href=\"Sigil%20Stone%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;Sigil Stone&lt;/a&gt;, which acts as a sort of battery to the gate. When the stone is removed, the portal will close and the gate will collapse in on itself.\nGreat Gates.\nAs demonstrated during the Oblivion Crisis, a variant of Oblivion Gate called Great Gates can be created to deploy massive weapons, such as &lt;a href=\"Siege%20Crawler\"&gt;Siege Crawler&lt;/a&gt;s. These Great Gates are several times larger than standard gates and are used during large-scale attacks on cities, such as at &lt;a href=\"Kvatch%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;Kvatch&lt;/a&gt; and at &lt;a href=\"Bruma%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;Bruma&lt;/a&gt;."}

They are fiery, magical portals that facilitate travel between the two planes. The strange humming, whining noise they emit can be heard before the gate is even found. The Oblivion Gates have been created by the &lt;a href=\"Daedric%20Prince\"&gt;Daedric Prince&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Mehrunes%20Dagon\"&gt;Mehrunes Dagon&lt;/a&gt;. He created these allowing the &lt;a href=\"Daedra\"&gt;Daedra&lt;/a&gt; to roam and conquer &lt;a href=\"Tamriel\"&gt;Tamriel&lt;/a&gt; while causing widespread destruction and chaos.\nBackground.\nClosing Oblivion Gates is one of the main tasks in . During the &lt;a href=\"Oblivion%20Crisis\"&gt;Oblivion Crisis&lt;/a&gt;, all of Tamriel was attacked by Mehrunes Dagon's &lt;a href=\"Daedric%20Forces%20of%20Destruction\"&gt;Daedric army&lt;/a&gt;. Oblivion Gates opened throughout all of Tamriel, and many cities were destroyed. &lt;a href=\"Martin%20Septim%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;Martin Septim&lt;/a&gt; summoned the &lt;a href=\"Avatar%20of%20Akatosh%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;Avatar of Akatosh&lt;/a&gt; and defeated Mehrunes Dagon during the Battle of the Imperial City, ending the Crisis and preventing more gates from opening.\nGate locations.\nMost Oblivion Gates appear pseudo-randomly throughout &lt;a href=\"Cyrodiil\"&gt;Cyrodiil&lt;/a&gt;, based on the &lt;a href=\"Hero%20of%20Kvatch\"&gt;Hero's&lt;/a&gt; progress along the &lt;a href=\"Main%20Quest%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;main questline&lt;/a&gt; of . There are 100 distinct locations where a gate can appear, and as each gate is closed that particular location will never spawn a new gate without the use of &lt;a href=\"Console%20Commands%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;console commands&lt;/a&gt;. However, no more than 60 separate gates will appear during a single game, including 10 gates which will always open in designated spots.\nThere are two gates that open on top of &lt;a href=\"Wayshrines%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;wayshrines&lt;/a&gt;. The first opens and completely buries the &lt;a href=\"Wayshrine%20of%20Mara\"&gt;Wayshrine of Mara&lt;/a&gt; northwest of &lt;a href=\"Anvil%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;Anvil&lt;/a&gt;. The second one opens on top of the &lt;a href=\"Wayshrine%20of%20Kynareth\"&gt;Wayshrine of Kynareth&lt;/a&gt; east of &lt;a href=\"Skingrad%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;Skingrad&lt;/a&gt; at the top of a steep hill down the gold road, breaking it in half, although this wayshrine can still be used by activating one of the two halves.\nWhen entering an Oblivion Gate, there are several exterior map templates randomly chosen from, as well as several interior maps for the towers and caves, which allows for different map configurations for each gate. The ten guaranteed gate locations lead to a specifically chosen Oblivion map; five gates lead to a specific one of the random worlds, and the other five have a custom Oblivion map with random towers.\nStatic gates.\nThese gates always spawn in the same location, and are triggered as soon as a specific part of the main quest line in completed.\nOnly three gates that are required to complete the main quest. These gates are:\nThe remaining gates are part of the \"&lt;a href=\"Allies%20for%20Bruma\"&gt;Allies for Bruma&lt;/a&gt;\" quest, one per city that may send allies. These open as soon as the Hero steals the &lt;a href=\"Mysterium%20Xarxes\"&gt;Mysterium Xarxes&lt;/a&gt; from the &lt;a href=\"Dagon%20Shrine\"&gt;Dagon Shrine&lt;/a&gt;. For each city, the nearby gate must be closed before the Count or Countess will risk sending their soldiers away to Bruma:\nRandom gates.\nIn addition to these ten gates, up to 50 out of the 90 remaining gate locations will spawn a gate as you progress through the main quest. These gates do not spawn all at once, but appear to spawn as the Hero nears their location. For example, one could pass an Oblivion Gate at one location, reload an earlier saved game, and no longer find it at that location. Once a gate spawns and is closed, the dead gate remains present for the rest of the game, and no other gate will spawn there. (Until the end of the main quest, Oblivion Gates \"can\" reopen).\nThe number of gates, and the odds of a gate appearing, depend on how much of the main quest line has been completed. After rescuing Martin from the Kvatch Gate, up to 25 random gates will open. When nearing each possible location, there is a 25% chance that a gate will spawn. At the same time that the fixed city gates open, the number of possible random gates increases to 50, its highest point. In addition, there is now a 50% chance of any given gate location spawning a gate. After retrieving the &lt;a href=\"Amulet%20of%20Kings%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;Amulet of Kings&lt;/a&gt; from &lt;a href=\"Paradise%20%28Location%29\"&gt;Paradise&lt;/a&gt;, the number of gates drops to 20, with a 20% chance of a new one spawning. Note that the maximum number of open gates also includes dead gates that have already been closed; that is, if the Hero has closed more than 20 gates by the time they return the amulet, no more will spawn.\nUpon finishing the main quest, the maximum number of open gates, and the odds of a new gate opening, both drop to zero. From this point, new gates can only be opened with console commands.\nBelow is an incomplete list of locations where a gate can open, along with a partial map to the right. The list is organized based on the nearest city to the gate location.\nQuests.\nThere are several quest that require going into Oblivion Gates:"}

I should be able to conduct my experiments here entirely undisturbed.\nI noticed blooming on the higher peaks of this mountain. Splashes of bright blue among the grays and greens. It's an odd time of year for flowers to open their petals, but perhaps it's the altitude at play. My study is deep enough within the cave that they shouldn't be a distraction.\nThe wind carries a stench of rot.

This was a number of years ago, before Queen Ayrenn took the throne. The Canonreeve of &lt;a href=\"Cloudrest%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Cloudrest&lt;/a&gt; at the time was a well-respected &lt;a href=\"Altmer%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Altmer&lt;/a&gt; of noble birth from a family with an unparalleled lineage. Which, of course, just goes to demonstrate that blood alone doesn't make the Altmer. Rumors began to reach one of our judiciars, and she began to look into the Canonreeve and his business practices. After a thorough investigation, it was determined that the Canonreeve was keeping choice antiquities from a nearby historical research project taking place in one of the many ruins within the &lt;a href=\"Eton%20Nir\"&gt;Eton Nir&lt;/a&gt; mountain. He altered manifests and records so that he could sell the antiquities to foreign collectors, leaving no trace that any items had gone missing. The judiciar gathered the evidence and eventually the Canonreeve learned that not even rank and noble blood were above the law of the land.\nThe Divine Prosecution also deals in matters of religious and cultural law. It is our job to police the social &lt;a href=\"Alaxon\"&gt;ordinances&lt;/a&gt; of Altmer society. The Case of the Imperfect Perfection provides an example for us to review. This incident concerned a jewelry crafter who had a run of bad luck that resulted in multiple necklaces, rings, and amulets that had noticeable flaws in their construction. It fell to Chief Justiciar &lt;a href=\"Naldulmo\"&gt;Naldulmo&lt;/a&gt; to investigate the accusations of consistent failure to craft perfect jewelry on the part of the artisan. When the Chief Justiciar ascertained that the crafter was indeed guilty of falling far from her past level of perfection, he carried out the warranted punishment and ordered the crafter to smash her alaxon sphere while he watched. The crafter would have to work to regain a state of perfection and petition to receive a new sphere.\nThese are just some of the cases handled by the Divine Prosecution."}

I asked him why Argonian names were so literal, and his reply was, \"Why aren't yours?\" \nI laughed, realizing I was bested. So I asked him to give me an Argonian name, one that suited someone of my ilk. \nAnd so from then on, I was Gathers-the-Coin.\nThe funny thing about an Argonian name is, I wasn't sure if it was meant to define the person I was or the one I aspired to be. I suppose the point is moot now. I'll probably die in this tower without a septim to my name. But at least if I keep writing, people will know our story, and know that we once lived."}

She carries contingencies and alternate plans with her the way a warrior carries multiple weapons, ready to pull out the right tool for whatever situation presents itself. But her recent actions have left me confused. I don't know what to think! Maybe if I write down what I know, my path will become clearer to me.\nWhile I am loathe to commit the entirety of Cassipia's actions to paper, as I don't want to inaccurately portray her complex thoughts, what I've seen and heard must be recorded. I don't want her enemies to twist the truth and paint her as some sort of &lt;a href=\"The%20Serpent%20%28Celestial%29\"&gt;Serpent&lt;/a&gt;-hating villain. The world needs to see Cassipia's brilliance for what it really is, as bright and piercing as a million stars, as opposed to the poor light in which she could possibly be bathed.\nIt was Cassipia who first noticed the connection between the primordial element our &lt;a href=\"Alchemists%20%28Online%29\"&gt;alchemists&lt;/a&gt; call &lt;a href=\"nirncrux\"&gt;nirncrux&lt;/a&gt; and the celestial energy of &lt;a href=\"Aetherius\"&gt;Aetherius&lt;/a&gt;. The idea to use the element to enhance the work of the &lt;a href=\"Iron%20Orcs\"&gt;Iron Orcs&lt;/a&gt; came to Cassipia almost immediately. And the stroke of genius to use it to create a new creature\u2014that came to her in a moment of pure inspiration worthy of the Serpent himself.\nBut then, when she saw how her work was being used at the Serpent's behest, my friend and mistress became increasingly enraged. She loved the creation of the &lt;a href=\"Mantikora%20%28Online%29\"&gt;mantikora&lt;/a&gt;, for example, but she hated that it was being turned into nothing but an engine of destruction. She appreciated the skill the Iron Orcs demonstrated with their metallurgy and alchemy, but she detested that such wonderful gear was being wasted on common &lt;a href=\"Troll%20%28Online%29\"&gt;trolls&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"welwas\"&gt;welwas&lt;/a&gt;.\nSuffice it to say, Cassipia has turned against the Serpent, and I don't know how to reconcile that fact. She says she will lead the &lt;a href=\"Scaled%20Court\"&gt;Scaled Court&lt;/a&gt; to a greatness the likes of which this world has never seen, but how can she accomplish this without the Serpent's blessing? I want to believe her, to trust in the woman I love and know. But can I also turn away from the Serpent's coiled embrace?\nCassipia is the Regent of Serpentine Stratagems, and I am barely worthy to stand in her undulating shadow. I know something of what she plans. How she hopes to use the stable &lt;a href=\"nirncrux\"&gt;nirncrux&lt;/a&gt; to elevate her power. But everything feels wrong now. And what she wants to do sounds so dangerous to me. I fear for her safety.\nOh, what should I do?"}

To the left (west) are two doors - a novice-locked door to the right (north) with nothing behind it but a &lt;a href=\"Soul%20Gem%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;soul gem&lt;/a&gt;, and an apprentice-locked door to the left with nothing behind it but a riekling corpse.\nBack at the T intersection, to the right (east), a short path leads to a door. Behind the door, the cave leads up out of the water, then turns right to the raised platform seen earlier. On the left (east) end of this platform, a short passage leads back to a riekling camp that overlooks the first large room in the cavern, with a bridge that spans this level. Before crossing the bridge, a very narrow ledge against the right wall leads to a few soul gems and a riekling hut with random loot.\nAcross the bridge to the east is another riekling camp with several more rieklings. Beyond that, a cave leads up to another large room with boxes to the right that have an apothecary's satchel lying on top. To the left (north) is a ramp down to the ground floor of the room, where three &lt;a href=\"Bristleback%20%28Dragonborn%29\"&gt;bristlebacks&lt;/a&gt; and a riekling are found next to another waterfall. In a crevice to the southwest is a novice-locked chest with a &lt;a href=\"Dibella%20statue\"&gt;Dibella statue&lt;/a&gt;.\nBack up at the entrance to the room, the path continues south, turns right (west), and leads to a door that opens onto an even higher overlook of the first large room in the cavern. Another small riekling camp here has two rieklings protecting it. A bridge leads west across this highest level of the room. At the other end of the bridge, another bridge to the left (southwest) leads to another camp with more rieklings, another riekling hut, and a chest next to the water containing leveled loot.\nA path leads west, then turns right (north) and leads to the Castle Karstaag Courtyard (which is synonymous with &lt;a href=\"Castle%20Karstaag%20Ruins\"&gt;Castle Karstaag Ruins&lt;/a&gt;).\nCastle Karstaag Ruins.\nUpon arriving here, there is at least one mounted riekling, as well as several others who are not. The mounted riekling has the &lt;a href=\"Castle%20Karstaag%20Key\"&gt;Castle Karstaag Key&lt;/a&gt; on its corpse. In addition, there is Karstaag's throne, which can be activated if &lt;a href=\"Karstaag%27s%20skull\"&gt;Karstaag's skull&lt;/a&gt; is in inventory (obtained from &lt;a href=\"Glacial%20Cave\"&gt;Glacial Cave&lt;/a&gt;). See the &lt;a href=\"Karstaag%20%28Dragonborn%29\"&gt;Karstaag&lt;/a&gt; article for details. A master-locked door to Solstheim can be opened with the key.\nQuests.\n&lt;a href=\"Paid%20in%20Full\"&gt;Paid in Full&lt;/a&gt;.\n&lt;a href=\"Glover%20Mallory\"&gt;Glover Mallory&lt;/a&gt;'s formula for creating &lt;a href=\"Bonemold%20Armor%20%28Dragonborn%29\"&gt;bonemold armor&lt;/a&gt; was taken by &lt;a href=\"Esmond%20Tyne\"&gt;Esmond Tyne&lt;/a&gt;, and he wants it back."}

The castle serves as the primary base for the &lt;a href=\"Volkihar%20Clan%20%28Dawnguard%29\"&gt;Volkihar Clan&lt;/a&gt;. If the &lt;a href=\"Last%20Dragonborn\"&gt;Dragonborn&lt;/a&gt; joins the Volkihar Vampires, the castle can be used as a home.\nLocation.\nCastle Volkihar is located in a previously inaccessible region in the far northwest corner of &lt;a href=\"Skyrim\"&gt;Skyrim&lt;/a&gt;, near the sea border with &lt;a href=\"High%20Rock\"&gt;High Rock&lt;/a&gt;. The entrance can initially be accessed via &lt;a href=\"Icewater%20Jetty\"&gt;Icewater Jetty&lt;/a&gt;, northwest of &lt;a href=\"Northwatch%20Keep\"&gt;Northwatch Keep&lt;/a&gt;. The castle can also be reached by &lt;a href=\"Travel%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Ferrymen&lt;/a&gt;, or by swimming across the channel.\nVolkihar Keep.\nVolkihar Keep is located inside Castle Volkihar, which is the primary residence for the Volkihar Vampires. Volkihar Keep is moderately large, with multiple levels and rooms.\nDining Hall.\nUpon entering the castle, the spacious main dining area is the most prominent sight. Two dining tables loaded with platters of &lt;a href=\"Human%20Flesh%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;human flesh&lt;/a&gt; and bones flank the long decorative rug that lines the center of the hall. A &lt;a href=\"Vampire%20Cattle%20%28Dawnguard%29\"&gt;vampire cattle&lt;/a&gt; is laid out on each table and fed upon by members of the court throughout the day. All the silver plates and goblets found here are smeared with blood.\nAt the back of the room is the main table where Lord Harkon's throne is found. This table is also where his primary advisors, &lt;a href=\"Vingalmo\"&gt;Vingalmo&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Orthjolf\"&gt;Orthjolf&lt;/a&gt;, typically sit.\nFeran's Laboratory.\nThis room is usually inhabited by &lt;a href=\"Feran%20Sadri\"&gt;Feran Sadri&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Ronthil\"&gt;Ronthil&lt;/a&gt; who can be found working or reading throughout the day.\nAn &lt;a href=\"Alchemy%20Lab%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Alchemy Lab&lt;/a&gt; and a display case with various &lt;a href=\"alchemy%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;alchemy&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"ingredients%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;ingredients&lt;/a&gt; can be found in the bottom floor. In addition, a dead &lt;a href=\"Dunmer%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Dunmer&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Alchemists%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;alchemist&lt;/a&gt; alongside a skeleton can be found lying on the main table. Near the main table is a bookshelf with an assortment of books. This room is also where Ronthil sleeps, usually behind the bookshelf as he is still considered a new recruit and not worthy of sleeping in the coffins that the other vampires sleep in.\nA set of stairs leads up to a balcony overlooking the laboratory where an &lt;a href=\"Arcane%20Enchanter%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;arcane enchanter&lt;/a&gt; and a display case with various &lt;a href=\"Soul%20Gem%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;soul gems&lt;/a&gt; can be found. Following the balcony leads to another section with a table and chair that overlooks the balcony. &lt;a href=\"Garan%20Marethi\"&gt;Garan Marethi&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Vingalmo\"&gt;Vingalmo&lt;/a&gt; can usually be found here.\nBloodstone Chalice Room.\nThis small blood spattered room is attached to the main dining area. The central feature is the small stone pedestal that the &lt;a href=\"Bloodstone%20Chalice\"&gt;Bloodstone Chalice&lt;/a&gt; sits on, once it is returned to the castle. This chalice grants &lt;a href=\"Blood%20of%20the%20Ancients\"&gt;Blood of the Ancients&lt;/a&gt; which allows &lt;a href=\"Vampiric%20Drain%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Vampiric Drain&lt;/a&gt; to absorb &lt;a href=\"magicka%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;magicka&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"stamina%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;stamina&lt;/a&gt; in addition to &lt;a href=\"health%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;health&lt;/a&gt;.\nIn addition to the chalice, two well stocked bookcases and a cupboard with a few bottles of &lt;a href=\"Skooma%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;skooma&lt;/a&gt; are the only things of note.\nSleeping Quarters.\nFrom the balcony area, the sleeping quarters can be accessed. This room contains eight coffins that are used by most of the vampires in the court. Sleeping in a coffin grants the &lt;a href=\"Vampiric%20Blood%20Rested\"&gt;Vampiric Blood Rested&lt;/a&gt; effect.\nAt the back of the room is a small unit that contains an assortment of &lt;a href=\"Vampire%20Armor%20%28Armor%20Piece%29\"&gt;vampire armors&lt;/a&gt;, two pairs of &lt;a href=\"Vampire%20Boots%20%28Light%20Armor%29\"&gt;vampire boots&lt;/a&gt; and a display case holding a &lt;a href=\"Bone%20Hawk%20Amulet\"&gt;bone hawk amulet&lt;/a&gt;. A weapons rack with a leveled weapon can be found near the entrance to the room.\nSmithy and Training Room.\nThe Castle's &lt;a href=\"Blacksmiths%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;blacksmith&lt;/a&gt; can be found off of the main dining area where &lt;a href=\"Hestla\"&gt;Hestla&lt;/a&gt; can be found tending to the forge. This area contains most crafting stations: a &lt;a href=\"forge\"&gt;forge&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Tanning%20Rack\"&gt;tanning rack&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"grindstone\"&gt;grindstone&lt;/a&gt; and a &lt;a href=\"workbench\"&gt;workbench&lt;/a&gt;, although it lacks a &lt;a href=\"smelter\"&gt;smelter&lt;/a&gt;. The upper walkway holds a weapon rack and a training dummy that &lt;a href=\"Fura%20Bloodmouth\"&gt;Fura Bloodmouth&lt;/a&gt; frequently practices against. Off to the side is a combat training area complete with ranged targets and additional weapon racks.\nHarkon's Room.\nNext, there is an area that &lt;a href=\"Harkon\"&gt;Harkon&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Serana\"&gt;Serana&lt;/a&gt; often visit, as it has their thrones and a giant locked cage used for keeping Vampire Cattle in. Harkon and Serana can be found sitting in front of the fireplace watching the flames from their chairs. There is a torture table in the middle of the room, with a vast array of torture instruments ranging from ladles to irons. A unique &lt;a href=\"werewolf%20pelt\"&gt;werewolf pelt&lt;/a&gt; can be found in a display case. There is also a &lt;a href=\"Knife%20%28Skyrim%20weapon%29\"&gt;knife&lt;/a&gt; that can be picked up and used as a weapon, even though it resembles a common &lt;a href=\"Silverware%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;silverware&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"knife%20%28Skyrim%20item%29\"&gt;knife&lt;/a&gt;.\nSerana's Room.\nBefore the \"&lt;a href=\"The%20Bloodstone%20Chalice\"&gt;The Bloodstone Chalice&lt;/a&gt;\" quest, the room is empty and abandoned, but after the quest is completed the room is fully furnished. There is an arcane enchanter and an alchemy lab in the southwest corner, as well as a few potions and soul gems around them. In the northwest part of the room there is a small closet containing a wardrobe and two locked glass cases: one with two unenchanted necklaces, the other with an enchanted dagger and an unenchanted ring. Also scattered around the room are various planters and pots containing different types of assorted flora, as well a minor loot around the two nightstands flanking the bed.\nKitchen.\nAfter passing through a small corridor with kegs of dripping blood in it is the kitchen. There are few things worth noting here aside from minor items and a bleeding rack, as well as a coffin usually used by &lt;a href=\"Rargal%20Thrallmaster\"&gt;Rargal Thrallmaster&lt;/a&gt;.\nThrall Dungeon.\nThere is a dungeon attached to the kitchen which has six vampire cattle locked away in jail cells and a couple of kegs of blood.\nVolkihar Cathedral.\nThe cathedral of the castle is mostly in ruins. Dark and dank, the most prominent feature is the large altar of &lt;a href=\"Molag%20Bal\"&gt;Molag Bal&lt;/a&gt; in the center that perpetually flows with blood. Around the sides of the room are stairs that lead to a small balcony above the main door and an empty chest can be found near the entrance. The Cathedral is the location where the Dragonborn and &lt;a href=\"Serana\"&gt;Serana&lt;/a&gt; confront Harkon in the quest \"&lt;a href=\"Kindred%20Judgment\"&gt;Kindred Judgment&lt;/a&gt;.\"\nVolkihar Dungeons.\nThe dungeon part of the castle is distinctly separate from the living quarters of the castle and are host to enemies. The Volkihar Dungeons include &lt;a href=\"Volkihar%20Undercroft\"&gt;Volkihar Undercroft&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Volkihar%20East%20Tower\"&gt;Volkihar East Tower&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Volkihar%20North%20Tower\"&gt;Volkihar North Tower&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Volkihar%20Ruins\"&gt;Volkihar Ruins&lt;/a&gt;.\nExterior.\nVolkihar Exterior Watchtower.\nThis watchtower is located across the castle on the other side of the bridge, next to the small wooden dock. It provides a high, safe place from which a guard can watch anyone attempting to approach the island.\nVolkihar Bridge.\nThis is the main entrance to the castle. Stone statues of &lt;a href=\"Gargoyle%20%28Dawnguard%29\"&gt;gargoyles&lt;/a&gt; line the pathway to the main gate and &lt;a href=\"bone%20hawk\"&gt;bone hawk&lt;/a&gt;s typically circle above. Along the rocky shore, several &lt;a href=\"Clam%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;clams&lt;/a&gt; can be found and harvested for &lt;a href=\"clam%20meat\"&gt;clam meat&lt;/a&gt;. Washed up crates, pieces of old wood, and debris are scattered around the castle's shoreline.\nVolkihar Docks.\nOn the north side of the island is an unused dock with a few sunken ships and some minor loot nearby. The inlet was used by the previous owners to bring supplies into the castle. Clams and a few barnacles can be found and harvested. Several hostile skeletons patrol nearby.\nCastle Volkihar Balcony.\nThe balcony is attached to Valerica's Study, where the &lt;a href=\"Soul%20Cairn%20%28Dawnguard%29\"&gt;Soul Cairn&lt;/a&gt; portal is located. The balcony is a fast travel location for Valerica's Study. The only loot that is out on the balcony is a &lt;a href=\"bloody%20tankard\"&gt;bloody tankard&lt;/a&gt; and two dead &lt;a href=\"salmon\"&gt;salmon&lt;/a&gt;."}

I have arrived in the hot and sandy land of &lt;a href=\"Northern%20Elsweyr\"&gt;Northern Elsweyr&lt;/a&gt;, home of the &lt;a href=\"Khajiit%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Khajiit&lt;/a&gt; cat people. It is very hot. And sandy. And you wouldn't believe how many Khajiit live here! It is more than Rigurt can count on both hands and even his feet!\nRigurt wants you to know that he is hip-deep in making friendly overtures to the nice cat people. Soon we will have a signed peace treaty and a fully operational cultural exchange. Has Rigurt ever failed you before. Well, except for that one time. And that other one. But I digest. And speaking of digesting, let me tell you about all the amazing food Rigurt has consumed here in the land of &lt;a href=\"Anequina\"&gt;Anequina&lt;/a&gt;! (That's what the cat people call Northern Elsweyr.)\nFirst, let me tell you about the cat food. Much of it is sweet, but it is also quite delicious. Goes well with mead, too. Three particular dishes stood out for Rigurt. I even acquired the recipes, so I can cook them for you when I return to Windhelm. We will have a feast fit for the &lt;a href=\"Jorunn%20the%20Skald-King\"&gt;Skald King&lt;/a&gt;! Do you think he would like to join us?\nI came upon a stall in a back alley in &lt;a href=\"Rimmen%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Rimmen&lt;/a&gt; where a twitchy little doggy-cat (don't ask me, the different types of Khajiit confuse Rigurt, too) was stirring a large pot from which wafted a most-pleasing aroma. It reminded me of the &lt;a href=\"Thane%20Jeggi%20Gap-Tooth\"&gt;Thane Jeggi&lt;/a&gt;'s Drinking Hole\u2014a combination of the pungent smell of fish and the sweet smell of spilled mead. Turns out, the doggy-cat was cooking what he referred to as sweet-glazed fish bits. I didn't know that fishes had bits, but when tossed with moon-sugar and stir-fried to a crispy crunch, they make for a nice afternoon snack. Rigurt ate four servings!\nIn the town of &lt;a href=\"Riverhold%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Riverhold&lt;/a&gt;, Rigurt entered the &lt;a href=\"Inn%20of%20Banished%20Regrets\"&gt;Inn of Banished Regrets&lt;/a&gt; as I have many, many regrets that need banishing. Immediately, Rigurt noticed that all the cat people were not only drinking\u2014they were eating crunchy little nuggets by the handful! Rigurt's mouth gushes with saliva just writing down these words! Who knew you could turn smelly, scaly lizards into delicious crunchy lizard kibble? It cost me a week's worth of mead, but I was able to convince the inn's cook to give me a copy of the recipe. It seems that the cat people can't stop eating the stuff, and Rigurt feels the same way. I just wish I hadn't read the recipe. Turns out, they use the inside of the lizard to make kibble, not the outside!\nOne dish that tasted amazing was the meat-cake pie I had at a cart in the &lt;a href=\"The%20Stitches\"&gt;Stitches&lt;/a&gt;. My taste buds did loops as they savory-sweet succulent slid down from my mouth to my tummy. Was it the main meal or dessert? It seemed to Rigurt to be both at the same time! It was confusing but very tasty. The chef refused to enlighten Rigurt as to what kind of actual meat was used as the filling. All she would say was, \"a little of this and a little of that.\" I will have to experiment when I get back to my own kitchen. Do not worry, I will make enough to share!\nNow, by this point in my trip, Rigurt has just about had his fill of sweet, sweet Khajiiti cooking. I was desperate to find a spicy rabbit meatball or a haunch of stewed mutton, but such Nord delicacies don't seem to exist in Northern Elsweyr. But I did find a bottle of Dark Moons spiced whiskey. While mead is the nectar of the gods, this spiced whiskey that the cat people distill burns so good on the way down. Rigurt got the impression that it was the beverage of choice for when even the Khajiiti sweet-tooth needs a break from all the syrupy goodness they consume on a regular basis. I acquired three casks of the stuff and plan to put it on the next boat to &lt;a href=\"Skyrim%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Skyrim&lt;/a&gt; as a gift for the Skald King. I know how much Jorunn appreciates a strong drink when he listens to my latest cultural report.\nRigurt the Brash, Ambassador-at-Large for the Nord Cultural Exchange"}

They gave up everything they had to protect this very land.\nThe term \"hero\" depends on one's point of view. One man's hero, after all, can be another's villain, and another's king might be your tyrant. But everyone buried in Cath Bedraud fought and died for this land. Each of them, in their own way, has allowed us to live as we live today.\nAnd beneath the graves of these heroes lies the catacombs. The place where I believe the kings and queens and royalty of the past have been entombed. My studies of the surrounding countryside indicate that the catacombs exist. However, I haven't been able to find an entrance into these hidden tombs. Allow me to speculate on subjects where existing records are incomplete at best.\nBefore our time, the greatest battles of the&lt;a href=\"Alessian%20Order\"&gt;Alessians&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Direnni%20Clan\"&gt;Direnni&lt;/a&gt; took place in this very land. Thousands lost their lives in the great battles that occurred here. After those conflicts, we saw the last Ayleid King pass away and the bloodline of the Direnni thin out.\nYet these Direnni had the most powerful magic at their command. Some say it was a type of magic that hasn't been seen before or since the Direnni. Magic that allowed them to bring down the tyranny of the Alessians and stop their army.\nI can only conclude that those who rest below Cath Bedraud are those heroes who fell in battle those long years ago. That the Direnni buried their own and then sealed the crypts so that their resting places would never be disturbed.\nI will continue to search for new evidence that supports this theory. And I will continue to explore Cath Bedraud in the hope of finding an entrance to these catacombs.\nI can only hope I don't disturb the Direnni magic that protects these tomes."}

How is it that some minds endure when others fail? What manifests in the aftermath of those outcomes? How can those manifestations be identified and altered? The workings of our own minds are as much a mystery as the workings of the material world, and it is no less dangerous to neglect their care than it is to mistreat the corporeal self.\nWhile Clockwork City is a facsimile of &lt;a href=\"Nirn\"&gt;Nirn&lt;/a&gt; in many ways, it is not a duplication. Many of the rules that govern the world simply do not apply to this realm, and things often taken for granted in the terrestrial world are found to be of vital importance to an individual's sanity when they are suddenly found scarce. Here I will outline a number of the most common afflictions to develop in previously well-adjusted individuals now inhabiting the Clockwork City.\nCyclical Inert Ingestion \u2014 Compulsive craving and ingestion of non-nutritious and sometimes harmful materials. It is not unusual for inhabitants and visitors in Clockwork City to experience a palate fatigue for the nutriment paste produced within the &lt;a href=\"Brass%20Fortress\"&gt;Brass Fortress&lt;/a&gt;, despite its inoffensive taste and complete nutritional profile. This often causes these individuals to experiment with consuming unusual substances for relief from that fatigue or because of a fallacious belief about the benefits of ingesting the substance that they have developed a taste for. In many cases this condition may safely go untreated, though some individuals' compulsions pose a significant danger to their health and those patients should be remanded to the Asylum Sanctorium for a more controlled therapeutic environment.\nMagnusomnic Melancholy \u2014 Connections between mortal beings and the stellar bodies are well established, though fraught with superstition and apocrypha. Our relationship with the sun is of particular relevance to the psyche. From simple moodiness and doldrums in the long nights of winter to the violent, frenzied aversion of victims of &lt;a href=\"Vampirism%20%28Online%29\"&gt;vampirism&lt;/a&gt;, exposure to the sun has a noticeable effect on the mental health of many races, so its complete absence from Clockwork City is trying on most individuals. Lethargy, irregular sleep patterns, dark thoughts or impulses, and a general malaise are all signs that your patient could be suffering from solar deprivation. See volumes on treatment regarding variations of light conjuration and simulated sunlight.\nEncapsulation Syndrome \u2014 A particularly insidious affliction similar to the acute fear of being trapped commonly observed in the terrestrial world. Individuals used to living their lives under the open sky are sometimes disconcerted by the easily demarcated boundaries of Sotha Sil's heavens. They begin to feel an inescapable sense of confinement that creates ever-present feelings of anxiety and agitation. These mounting pressures will push them to breaking point if left unresolved and should be considered a priority for treatment.\nMinisculation Terrors \u2014 The terrors can be defined as bouts of irrational panic and paranoia that the victims are shrinking. It is unclear whether these episodes are a side effect of transitioning into this realm, or a pathological reaction to the experience of being miniaturized. Patients tend to describe peculiarities in their perception, ranging from a vague sense of things just being a little off, to vertigo, to delusional claims of evidence. For example, one such patient cited that they were now unable to reach an object they had placed on a high shelf the day before. Often these claims are a result of misremembered details, such as forgetting that they were wearing thick heeled shoes, though there is at least one recorded case of legitimate uncontrolled shrinking, so be diligent in investigating these claims.\nObsessive Focus and Fixation \u2014 Particularly common among apostles. Sometimes our colleagues must be saved from themselves. Clockwork City was designed with freedom from distraction in mind. It is a place of contemplation and learning, and sometimes the example Lord &lt;a href=\"Sotha%20Sil\"&gt;Sotha Sil&lt;/a&gt; sets is adhered to too closely by his followers. We are not gods. We cannot withdraw into our studies indefinitely and tirelessly without consequence. It may be necessary to intervene in the studies of an apostle who has developed an unhealthy obsession with their research. Fixated patients have been known to neglect sleep, forget to eat, shun all contact with others, and in some cases literally work themselves to death. As such, we are granted the authority to remand such cases to Asylum Sanctorium at our discretion.\nCorporeal Odium \u2014 Self-loathing, specifically of one's physical form. Outside of Clockwork City it was primarily observed in kingdoms where one's physical features or biological heritage play a significant role in an individual's societal worth. It is also a fairly common trait among possessing spirits. This condition is on the rise among &lt;a href=\"Clockwork%20Apostles\"&gt;Clockwork Apostles&lt;/a&gt; who believe their enhancements represent an ideal that their native flesh fails to live up to. Reckless augmentation, self-mutilation, and emotional volatility are all warning signs that an apostle's desire for alteration has become an unhealthy obsession and the patient should likely be remanded to the Asylum Sanctorium for psycho-spiritual realignment."}

No pretense is made that this list is complete. New discoveries are made and new enchantments are revealed often enough that this work will eventually become outdated. Those who follow may choose to revise this work as needed.\nThe most common enchantments for armor and other garb are those that improve health, magick or stamina. Fortifying the wearers &lt;a href=\"Fortify%20Health%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;health&lt;/a&gt; is popular with warriors. It actually makes the wearer harder to kill, binding his life force a bit tighter to his body. &lt;a href=\"Fortify%20Magicka%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Fortifying magicka&lt;/a&gt; is more commonly seen in clothing because wizards tend to avoid bulky, restrictive armor. It allows the wizard to cast more spells before becoming magically exhausted. &lt;a href=\"Fortify%20Stamina\"&gt;Fortifying stamina&lt;/a&gt; is a secondary choice for fighters. They tire less quickly, but do not survive their wounds any better.\nThere is a wide range of physical and mental attributes or skills that can be fortified by enchantments. There are as many of these as there are wizards with imagination. A few choice examples are &lt;a href=\"Fortify%20Archery\"&gt;archery&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Fortify%20Sneak\"&gt;sneaking&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Fortify%20Conjuration\"&gt;conjuration&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Fortify%20Carry%20Weight\"&gt;carrying strength&lt;/a&gt;. The focus is always quite narrow. There are even examples of gauntlets that are enchanted to improve the wearers ability to enchant things.\nAnother common form of armor enchantment are the resistances. The elemental resistances are marginally easier to find and make. make the wearer less susceptible to &lt;a href=\"Resist%20Fire%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;burning&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Resist%20Frost%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;freezing&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Resist%20Shock%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;shocks&lt;/a&gt;. There are also &lt;a href=\"Resist%20Poison%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;poison resistances&lt;/a&gt; and enchantments that will resist all forms of &lt;a href=\"Resist%20Magic%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;magic&lt;/a&gt;.\nAn uncommon pair of enchantments are &lt;a href=\"Waterbreathing%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;waterbreathing&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"muffle\"&gt;muffle&lt;/a&gt;. The former allows the wearing to swim underwater indefinitely. The later totally silences the clinking and clanking of the armor so the wearer moves more quietly. It's been speculated that muffle is a wizard's lazy solution to a problem that could be solved with cloth and wrappings.\nThe rarest of enchantments increase the recovery rate of &lt;a href=\"Fortify%20Healing%20Rate\"&gt;health&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Fortify%20Magicka%20Regeneration\"&gt;magicka&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"Fortify%20Stamina%20Regeneration\"&gt;stamina&lt;/a&gt;. The wearer actually heals from his wounds while you watch, even if he is in the midst of a battle. Wizards normally recover their magical energy at a moderate pace. Wearing this armor makes that recovery much faster. The same is true for stamina recovery enchantments. The wearer tires just as quickly as always, but seems to get his wind back much faster."}

No pretense is made that this list is complete. New discoveries are made and new enchantments are revealed often enough that this work will eventually become outdated. Those who follow may choose to revise this work as needed.\nWeapons such as axes and bows can hold a wide variety of enchantments. The most common are &lt;a href=\"Fire%20Damage%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;fire&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Frost%20Damage%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;frost&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Shock%20Damage%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;lightning&lt;/a&gt;. The simple, yet effective enchantments burn, freeze or shock when they draw blood.\nOnly slightly less common are weapon enchantments that &lt;a href=\"Drain%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;drain&lt;/a&gt;\u00a0&lt;a href=\"Magicka%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;magicka&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"Stamina%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;stamina&lt;/a&gt;. These drain off a wizards reserve of power, tiring him magically just as the weapons that strain stamina tire their victims physically. Unlike the elemental enchantments, the enchantment [alone] cannot kill, although the weapon itself can still take a life.\nEqually least common are the enchantments of &lt;a href=\"Fear%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;fear&lt;/a&gt;. There are two varieties, one for the living, and one for the undead. The former will only affect living creatures, not &lt;a href=\"Undead%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;undead&lt;/a&gt;, or magical constructs such as &lt;a href=\"atronach\"&gt;atronach&lt;/a&gt;s and &lt;a href=\"Animunculi\"&gt;dwarven automatons&lt;/a&gt;. The latter cause &lt;a href=\"Draugr%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;draugr&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Skeleton%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;skeletons&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Vampire%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;vampires&lt;/a&gt; and the like to flee. There is no known fear enchantment that will affect dwarven machines.\nA particularly insidious, but somewhat common enchantment, is &lt;a href=\"Soul%20Trap%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;soul trap&lt;/a&gt;. Upon entering the blood, the victim's &lt;a href=\"soul\"&gt;soul&lt;/a&gt; is bound. Should he die shortly thereafter, his soul is siphoned off to a nearby soul gem. This form of magic should only be used against beasts and monsters. To use it against &lt;a href=\"men\"&gt;men&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"elves\"&gt;elves&lt;/a&gt; is abhorrent.\nNoticeably more rare are the absorb enchantments. There are three known types that drain the victims &lt;a href=\"Absorb%20Health%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;health&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Absorb%20Magicka%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;magicka&lt;/a&gt;, or &lt;a href=\"Absorb%20Stamina\"&gt;stamina&lt;/a&gt;. The weapon becomes a conduit, transferring the stolen energy from the victim to the wielder. These are sometimes referred to as vampiric enchantments. As discussed above, absorbing magicka and stamina is not in itself deadly. Absorbing health can actually steal the life from a creature.\nThe rarest of enchantments are those of banishment and paralyzation. &lt;a href=\"Banish%20%28Effect%29\"&gt;Banishment&lt;/a&gt; only affects summoned atronachs or undead raised by wizards. The banishment breaks the link between the caster and the creature. Summoned atronach return to the &lt;a href=\"Oblivion%20plane\"&gt;Oblivion plane&lt;/a&gt; from whence they came. Raised undead are released. It is important to note that self-willed undead are not affected by banishment.\n&lt;a href=\"Paralyze%20%28Skyrim%29%23As%20an%20Enchantment\"&gt;Paralyzation&lt;/a&gt; is simple, yet deadly. The affected creature becomes rigid and unable to move for a short time. This is one of the most prized enchantments among warriors. A paralyzed opponent can be dispatched with ease. It is important to note that many creatures are immune to paralysis, such as Atronachs, skeletons, &lt;a href=\"Ice%20Wraith%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;ice wraiths&lt;/a&gt;, and dwarven automatons."}

I have gone over all possible candidates for a catalyst to ignite the process to forge the antipodal rods. The only substance that we might have access to is the corrupted blood of a feral creature.\nWe examined a dead creature and Zur tried to transform its blood, but his &lt;a href=\"Alchemy%20%28Online%29\"&gt;alchemical&lt;/a&gt; process was flawed. Our &lt;a href=\"Daedric\"&gt;Daedric&lt;/a&gt; captors, however, apparently had more success in this area. Samples of corrupted blood are stored in the experiment chamber, where they are guarded by a monster the Daedra created using that very same blood.\nNow you comprehend my despair.

I fear this mission has already ended in failure and that we are doomed to succumb to this soul-meld. But I shall not dash Zur's hope.

You begin upon a journey of great importance and spiritual reward, but you are not the first to tread this path, nor will you be the last. Many share this journey and will tackle the same challenges that stand before you. While your path may not lead to the same destination as your fellow novitiates, it does travel in the same general direction.\nAs you begin to perform the duties of the &lt;a href=\"Cathedral%20of%20Akatosh%20%28Faction%29\"&gt;Cathedral of Akatosh&lt;/a&gt;, you must ask yourself how you wish to revere the Dragon God of Time. Will you spread the word of the Dragon God though prayer and guidance, leading worshipers though their devotions and hearing their pleas? Or will you take the pulpit and the street with holy texts in hand, speaking the truths of the Divines to those who require a rekindling of the fires of faith?\nAfter you complete your initiations, you will be asked to make that choice. To take up the mantle of Chanter or &lt;a href=\"Sermonizer\"&gt;Sermonizer&lt;/a&gt;. Reflect on your decision carefully, for the demands of each branch in the path are very different.\nRemember that the Primate oversees all aspects of Akatosh worship in the Cathedral, supported equally by the Grand Chanter and the Grand Sermonizer. For this reason, Chanters and Sermonizers stand shoulder-to-shoulder, bringing the light of Akatosh to the masses in equal but different ways.\nAs a Chanter, you will follow the lead of the Grand Chanter, offering compassion and guidance to those who come to our Cathedral in need. You will learn to mend their bodies, minds, and spirits with prayer and wisdom, as well as become a teacher yourself, leading worshipers though their offerings and rituals so that they can grow closer to Akatosh.\nAs a Sermonizer, you will muster behind the Grand Sermonizer, armoring your conviction against the great enemies of heresy and infidelity to guide the lost and faithless back to protective wings of the Dragon God. You will learn to wield words that will strike the heard, burning the impurities of dark influence and self-indulgence. The wicked must be chastised and condemned before they may be redeemed, and it is you who will drive out their darkness.\nDo not mistake this division of duties for a lack of unity in purpose. We are guided by the Primate, who has the wisdom to see that both paths are equally important to the reverence of Akatosh. The Primate is the guiding light of our Cathedral, improving the lives of all who look upon its shining brilliance. The Primate, like Akatosh, will never lead you astray.\nAnd if a different task calls to you, one of military service and the need to safeguard the faithful, consider pledging yourself to the &lt;a href=\"Order%20of%20the%20Hour%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Order of the Hour&lt;/a&gt;. Keeping the Cathedral and the faithful of Akatosh safe from the dangers of the world is a noble calling, should the more spiritual nature of life in the Cathedral seem like too mundane a method to show your devotion to the Dragon God of Time.\nThese paths stand before you, novitiate. May Akatosh guide you to your ultimate destination."}

After months of wandering I have so far only encountered some variations of the same basic species.\nIn my travels I have encountered several &lt;a href=\"Khajiit%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Khajiit&lt;/a&gt; outcast from their clans that have taken up residence in Skyrim.

I have also seen it pounce forward on its prey in a particularly powerful attack.\nThe snowy version of the sabrecat has spotted white fur which I believe it uses more for stalking more than its cousin in the plains.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Sabre%20Cat%20Tooth\"&gt;tooth&lt;/a&gt; of the cat is rumored to be useful in &lt;a href=\"Potions%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;potions&lt;/a&gt; that restore the &lt;a href=\"Stamina%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;stamina&lt;/a&gt; as well as a potion that will temporarily give a more keen eye for &lt;a href=\"Smithing%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;smithing&lt;/a&gt;.\nAny skillful hunter can usually salvage the &lt;a href=\"Sabre%20Cat%20Pelt\"&gt;pelts&lt;/a&gt; and teeth of their kill, but report that the meat is tasteless and not fit to eat."}

Fight the Orc to get the real key to exit the facility as Kurdan said the key taken from the orc was a fake. He is wearing leveled heavy armor and carrying a leveled warhammer, and at higher levels may be carrying other enchanted items.

We lived deep enough within the marsh that outsiders never visited, and the threat of &lt;a href=\"Slavery\"&gt;slavers&lt;/a&gt; from &lt;a href=\"House%20Dres%20%28Online%29\"&gt;House Dres&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"Morrowind%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Morrowind&lt;/a&gt; seemed distant. We believed slaver attacks only happened to other &lt;a href=\"Saxhleel\"&gt;Saxhleel&lt;/a&gt;. Even if they did come for us, our sentries had bright eyes and quick arrows; they laughed at the thought of &lt;a href=\"Mer\"&gt;Elves&lt;/a&gt; splashing towards our home.\nWe underestimated the greed and cunning of House Dres. They came in the darkest coils of night, their hateful Elven magics shielding them from our watchers. They walked across the water, light as motes on a breeze even in their ebony plate, silent as the pools they crossed. Fiery arrows scattered us while &lt;a href=\"Dunmer%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Dunmeri&lt;/a&gt; magic lulled villagers to sleep, and comatose bodies were dragged off under covering fire. Though we attempted pursuit, many of our warriors were sapped by heavy magic that pulled their feet under the mud.\nWe debated what to do as dawn crept over our homes, withered and wounded by the Elves' attack. Voices called for us to flee, but Xil-Go's voice rang out above the others. \"No! We shall not let these dryskin plunderers take us or our village. We cannot. Please allow me just one day, and I will find a way to turn them away for good.\" We were eager to defend our village, and Xil-Go knew something of the ways of magic and mysteries, and so we all agreed to her request.\nShe disappeared into her hut and stayed inside throughout the day, not even pausing to eat. The villagers grew restless as the sun dipped low. Finally she emerged. \"I know what we must do. Any of you who can work even the faintest magic, come with me. If you can shoot a bow, arm yourself with arrows and these poisons I have made. We will need your protection when they return.\"\nThe village waited. When the next attack came, we were ready. Expecting us to be easy prey again, they came exactly the same way\u2014walking upon the water and making no sounds. They did not expect the wards, which exploded in bright blasts of light, giving the signal for our archers to shoot and for Xil-Go and the others to begin their spell. The slavers recovered from their shock quickly and charged forward, still a formidable and well-armed force.\nThen it started. You could see the uncertainty in their pinched faces as the spell began to blossom. Next came the howls of pain, the smell of ashen flesh sizzling as the armor grew hotter and hotter. The Elves scrambled to protect themselves, trying to rip off the heavy plates or cool them down with their own magics, but it was too late for them to recover. Our warriors fell on the intruders, and not one Elf escaped.\nWe spread word of our victory, sending the tale far and wide through the villages, knowing the story would take root in our enemies' ears. To this day, I hear the slavers are reluctant to wear heavy armors into raids. Most wear much lighter armor now, even if it does make them easier targets for our archers. And that is fine with us."}

Y'ffelon is found in the center of the archipelago, and is dominated by the sacred volcano of &lt;a href=\"Mount%20Firesong\"&gt;Mount Firesong&lt;/a&gt;, whose roots run all through the Systres. The entire archipelago is volcanic, with many steam vents, hot springs, and other such features found in the island's back country, and tapping into the earth-energies of the island can lend immense magical power. The druids were able to instill magic on Y'ffelon to balance nature and bring life to the land.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Firesong%20Circle\"&gt;Firesong Circle&lt;/a&gt; controls Y'ffelon and do not welcome outsiders. They \"hear Y'ffre's voice in the restlessness of the mountain\" and work to keep it from erupting, rarely ever leaving the island.\nHistory.\nAfter leaving High Rock, the druids made the perilous voyage to the Systres. According to legend, this was either by following a mysterious \"song\" the eldest druids heard on the wind, or by carrying an Elder Scroll with them and following its guidance to the shores of their new adopted home, Y'ffelon. In druid orthodoxy, the first Draoife harnessed the power of the Earthbones to transform the scarred, volcanic island into a verdant paradise. These \"three mornings of sail\" witnessed the rise of the druidic Circles, with the oldest being the Firesong Circle.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Sinistral%20Elves\"&gt;Sinistral Elves&lt;/a&gt; arrived on Amenos from Yokuda in &lt;a href=\"1E%20660\"&gt;1E 660&lt;/a&gt; and began their conquest of the archipelago, laying siege to Y'ffelon. The siege of the Systres was a protracted affair resulting in the deaths of hundreds of fighters on both Elvish and Druid sides. In the end, as the Elves approached the heart of druidom, the islands themselves intervened; the druids' sacred volcano of Mount Firesong erupted in &lt;a href=\"1E%20676\"&gt;1E 676&lt;/a&gt;, consuming both druids and Elves in a fiery cataclysm. It is suspected this was a disastrous result of a miscalculated spell spiraling out of control. It was comparable to the &lt;a href=\"Sun%27s%20Death\"&gt;Sun's Death&lt;/a&gt; disaster of &lt;a href=\"1E%20668\"&gt;1E 668&lt;/a&gt;, and may have even been related given the corresponding dates.\nThe long dormant &lt;a href=\"Mount%20Firesong\"&gt;Mount Firesong&lt;/a&gt; erupted a second time in &lt;a href=\"1E%202484\"&gt;1E 2484&lt;/a&gt;.\nDuring the Three Banners War, the Dreadsails had been operating in Y'ffelon. The island was granted to House Dufort after Ranser's War, though they cared little for what occurred on what they considered a \"wild and desolate\" territory. Captain Silengos was ordered to suspend operations in Y'ffelon and travel to Skulltooth Cove. Circa 2E 582, the island was \"waking up\" and tremors could be felt in High Isle."}

After the laws of nature were established, mortals had some safety in the world because they could understand it. Y'ffre is called the Storyteller because of the lessons he taught the Bosmer.

It's a privilege I've had only a handful of times, as wild indriks are wary by nature and exceptionally elusive. It's said that they can vanish in an instant when gazed upon by those with impure intent.\nIt feels trite to say that you will know an indrik when you see one, but few words seem up to the task of describing the creatures. A folk tale as old as the &lt;a href=\"Altmer%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Altmer&lt;/a&gt; civilization tells of how &lt;a href=\"Y%27ffre\"&gt;Y'ffre&lt;/a&gt; the Singer wove indriks out of the very essence of the forest, giving them the aspect of every living thing found within. You might, with the briefest of glances, mistake one for a common deer, but even the most casual observation will reveal indriks are so much more.\nThe first thing likely to catch your eye about indriks are their antlers. Points of the finest crystal sprout from their crowns like the branches of some great, glimmering tree. This mesmerizing sight has been the end of many an ambitious hunter who thought the rack would make a fine prize. Let down your guard, for even a moment, and you risk being impaled by the stately lance jutting out from an indrik's forehead. There are countless legends surrounding the indrik's horn: that they are an alchemical cure-all, that touching one will extend your life seven-fold, even that they're made from Y'ffre's tears. All I can truly tell you is that an indrik's horn is both beautiful and deadly. If you believe what I've described thus far to be far-fetched, I've yet to even begin.\nThe body of an indrik is covered in a tapestry of fur, feathers, and fronds that defy classification. One might ask themselves: are they animal, bird, or plant? Can they be all of those things at once? They might not be any of those things at all. Some scholars theorize that indriks are divine beings, not truly of this world, closer to &lt;a href=\"Aedra\"&gt;Aedra&lt;/a&gt; than mortal. One fable tells of a Mer who kills an indrik, only to find its heart is pure crystal. He decides to give the perfect gem to his ladylove, but she is so beguiled by its splendor that her avarice taints the perfect gem, cursing it. From then on, the couple's lives are filled with such sorrow that they cast themselves into the sea, leaving their kin to fight over the precious gem and carry on the curse. A fanciful tale, but while there is no doubt that indriks are inherently magical, I've found scant evidence indicating that they are literally the stuff of magic.\nI suppose I should mention that they possess four ears. For any other animal that would surely stand out, but given what I've already described, I'm sure you'll agree that it hardly seems noteworthy. Presumably, this trait helps them appraise their surroundings and evade threats, but I'm certain there's a story out there somewhere claiming one pair is for hearing in the physical world and the other the spiritual. Until the indriks are studied more closely, they will continue to remain creatures surrounded by myth, but I can't help but feel like these creatures would be diminished by having their secrets laid bare. After all, who doesn't enjoy a little mystery in the world?"}

Yaghoub had conquered the &lt;a href=\"Elves\"&gt;Elves&lt;/a&gt; that lived in the region and established &lt;a href=\"Samuruik\"&gt;Samuruik&lt;/a&gt;, the modern-day Palace of Sentinel.\nHistory.\nYaghoub was one of the many Redguard explorers to lead the &lt;a href=\"Ra%20Gada\"&gt;Ra Gada&lt;/a&gt; wave onto the province of Hammerfell. Yaghoub sailed across the &lt;a href=\"Iliac%20Bay\"&gt;Iliac Bay&lt;/a&gt;, bringing conflict everywhere he went in the &lt;a href=\"Breton\"&gt;Breton&lt;/a&gt; kingdoms. Yaghoub hailed from the region of &lt;a href=\"Akos%20Kasaz\"&gt;Akos Kasaz&lt;/a&gt;, the largest region of &lt;a href=\"Yokuda\"&gt;Yokuda&lt;/a&gt;, and so, he brought several things along the way. Yaghoub brought the &lt;a href=\"Yokudan%20Chargers\"&gt;Yokudan Chargers&lt;/a&gt;, a powerful breed of horse that now resides in the &lt;a href=\"Aswala%20Stables\"&gt;Aswala Stables&lt;/a&gt;, near the city of &lt;a href=\"Lainlyn\"&gt;Lainlyn&lt;/a&gt;. Yaghoub sailed from the city of &lt;a href=\"Hegathe\"&gt;Hegathe&lt;/a&gt;, around the &lt;a href=\"Cape%20Shira\"&gt;Cape Shira&lt;/a&gt;, where he eventually found Sentinel, on the seventeenth of &lt;a href=\"Second%20Seed\"&gt;Second Seed&lt;/a&gt;, towards &lt;a href=\"the%20Steed\"&gt;the Steed&lt;/a&gt; constellation. When Yaghoub discovered Sentinel, he let his men indulge themselves with the pomegranate and fig groves of the area. He would then conquer the residents already living in the city, making them stonemasons and servants. Through his power, the Palace of Sentinel, Samuruik was created, becoming the throne of Sentinel for &lt;a href=\"the%20Crowns\"&gt;the Crowns&lt;/a&gt; that would soon follow.\nLegacy.\nBecause of this momentous event in Redguard history, the day is celebrated in the holiday named &lt;a href=\"Koomu%20Alezer%27i\"&gt;Koomu Alezer'i&lt;/a&gt;, which is celebrated on the seventeenth of Second Seed. The holiday serves as a symbol of remembrance of his accomplishments and serves as an excuse to eat bountiful amounts of pomegranate."}

It is an optional quest of the main questline and serves to provide a path forward in the case that &lt;a href=\"Vivec\"&gt;Vivec&lt;/a&gt; is killed prior to the completion of the questline.\nWalkthrough.\nKill Vivec.\nIn order to start the quest you must go to the Palace of Vivec in &lt;a href=\"Vivec%20City%20%28Morrowind%29\"&gt;Vivec City&lt;/a&gt; and instead of acquiring &lt;a href=\"Wraithguard\"&gt;Wraithguard&lt;/a&gt; as a gift from Vivec, you must instead kill him and retrieve the &lt;a href=\"Unique%20Dwemer%20Artifact\"&gt;Unique Dwemer Artifact&lt;/a&gt; from Vivec's Corpse.\nSpeak with Yagrum Bagarn.\nAfter retrieving the Unique Dwemer Artifact, you must go to the Last Dwarf, &lt;a href=\"Yagrum%20Bagarn%20%28Morrowind%29\"&gt;Yagrum Bagarn&lt;/a&gt;, who is found at the &lt;a href=\"Corprusarium\"&gt;Corprusarium&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Tel%20Fyr%20%28Morrowind%29\"&gt;Tel Fyr&lt;/a&gt;. With the Unique Dwemer Artifact in your possession, Yagrum Bagarn will realize that it is actually a deactivated Wraithguard and he will offer to fix it for you.\n\"I have nothing. Go away. Leave me in peace... but... wait. What is that you have there? Is that what I think it is? That unique dwemer artifact you have?\"\nThis allows for the dialogue option \"Unique Dwemer Artifact\".\nUnique Dwemer Artifact: \"Do you know what this is? This is Wraithguard, an enchanted device created ages ago by my former master, High Craftlord Kagrenac, a long-dead Dwemer mage-smith. I believe it is one of the tools he created to forge mythopoeic enchantments. I was one of Lord Kagrenac's Master Crafters, and though I didn't work on this project, I knew of it from my fellow mage-smiths.\"\nYou will then have the dialogue option \"Mythopoeic Enchantments\", followed by the ability to ask if he can fix the deactivated Wraithguard. Yagrum will agree to fix it but you must first find &lt;a href=\"Kagrenac%27s%20Journal\"&gt;Kagrenac's Journal&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Kagrenac%27s%20Planbook\"&gt;Kagrenac's Planbook&lt;/a&gt;.\nMythopoeic Enchantments: \"I'm not sure I can explain. In his search for the secrets of immortality, Kagrenac sought to control supernatural forces that you might call 'divine'. This artifact -- called 'Wraithguard -- was one of the tools that he created for this purpose. Some believed his tampering with such forces was profane, and terribly dangerous. You know the Dwemer disappeared? His use of these tools may have been responsible.\"\nContinued\nMythopoeic Enchantments: \"I'm not sure. Let me see. [Examines the artifact.] No. I don't think so. Not without Kagrenac's Planbook and Kagrenac's Journals. But, if the originals still exist, and I could study them, then, yes, perhaps I could restore the artifact. Whether I should or would, on the other hand, that is a different matter.\"\nAt this point you can show him the \"&lt;a href=\"Plan%20to%20Defeat%20Dagoth%20Ur\"&gt;Plan to Defeat Dagoth Ur&lt;/a&gt;\" and \"&lt;a href=\"Dagoth%20Ur%27s%20Plans\"&gt;Dagoth Ur's Plans&lt;/a&gt;\" if you have them in your possession, though this isn't required.\nShow him 'Vivec's Plan' and 'Dagoth Ur's Plans': [Reads 'Vivec's Plan' and 'Dagoth Ur's Plans'.] \"I see. Dagoth Ur's use of the enchantments on the Heart of Lorkhan presents a great danger. And you need this artifact -- Wraithguard -- to destroy those enchantments, and Dagoth Ur. This is a good cause. If you can find Kagrenac's Planbook and Kagrenac's Journals and bring them to me, I will do my best to restore Wraithguard to its proper functions.\"\nFind Kagrenac's Books.\nKagrenac's books are found in the &lt;a href=\"Dwemer%20Ruins%20%28Morrowind%29\"&gt;Dwemer Ruins&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Endusal\"&gt;Endusal&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Tureynulal\"&gt;Tureynulal&lt;/a&gt;. They don't have to be acquired in any specific order.\nEndusal is found in the &lt;a href=\"Red%20Mountain%20Region\"&gt;Red Mountain Region&lt;/a&gt; within the &lt;a href=\"Ghostfence\"&gt;Ghostfence&lt;/a&gt; southwest of &lt;a href=\"Dagoth%20Ur%20%28Morrowind%20Location%29\"&gt;Dagoth-Ur&lt;/a&gt;, it is guarded by many &lt;a href=\"Ash%20Creature\"&gt;Ash Creature&lt;/a&gt;s and the &lt;a href=\"Ash%20Vampire\"&gt;Ash Vampire&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Dagoth%20Endus\"&gt;Dagoth Endus&lt;/a&gt;. This ruin is the location of &lt;a href=\"Kagrenac%27s%20Journal\"&gt;Kagrenac's Journal&lt;/a&gt;.\nTureynulal, like Endusal, is also found in the Red Mountain Region, and is east of the Dagoth-Ur facility. Tureynulal is also defended by ash creatures as well as the Ash Vampire &lt;a href=\"Dagoth%20Tureynul\"&gt;Dagoth Tureynul&lt;/a&gt;. This ruin contains \"&lt;a href=\"Kagrenac%27s%20Planbook\"&gt;Kagrenac's Planbook&lt;/a&gt;\".\nReturn to Yagrum.\nOnce you have retrieved Kagrenac's Books from their respective dungeons and return to the Corprusarium, Yagrum will study them for 24 hours.\n\"If you have really brought me Kagrenac's Planbook and Kagrenac's Journals, I can at least try to restore the mythopoeic enchantments on Wraithguard.\"\nMythopoeic Enchantments: \"You've found Kagrenac's Journals and Kagrenac's Planbook! Good. I'll take them and study them. It shouldn't take long. Give me a day, then come back, and I think I can restore Wraithguard's mythopoeic enchantments.\"\nAfter waiting a day, Yagrum will understand how to restore Wraithguard's mythopoeic enchantment.\n\"I have learned all I can from Kagrenac's Planbook and Kagrenac's Journals. Now, if you're still willing, I'll try to restore the mythopoeic enchantments on Wraithguard.\"\nMythopoeic Enchantments: \"I've studied Kagrenac's Planbook and Journals. I know what to do. The artifact simply must be harmonized with your personal magicka signature. However, the process is dangerous. You will certainly be injured. I am not sure you will survive the process. There is no risk now, while I harmonize the artifact with your magicka, but when you first equip Wraithguard, you should fortify your health as much as possible. Are you ready for me to activate Wraithguard and harmonize it to your magicka signature?\"\nYou then must ask him to reactivate Wraithguard in which he'll reply;\nMythopoeic Enchantments: \"Very well.\" [Yagrum Bagarn takes the unique Dwemer artifact, and performs a series of manipulations. He then returns it.] \"Now, the first time you equip Wraithguard, you will experience a terrible shock. If you are in perfect health, and you have fortified your health as much as possible, I believe you will survive. But you MUST fortify your health as much as possible beforehand. Afterwards, Wraithguard should be working as designed, and everything will be fine.\"\n\"If you are in perfect health, and you have fortified your health as much as possible, there is a very good chance you will survive the first time you equip Wraithguard. And thereafter, Wraithguard will work as designed.\"\nAfter this, you will receive Wraithguard.\nWarning: Equipping Wraithguard will make you permanently lose 200\u2013225 Health."}

But by &lt;a href=\"Malacath%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Malacath&lt;/a&gt;, he kept going.\nHe went on about all the different legends and the hundreds of Ragnars involved with them. He talked for hours about his family, and days about his mead. He even sang about them. Silence wasn't an option. Perhaps if they'd put that on my bounty, I might have been okay with the rest of it.\nBut as a blacksmith, there was one story I didn't get tired of. The one about the &lt;a href=\"Skyforge%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Skyforge&lt;/a&gt;.\n\"It's an ancient relic, watched over by a great stone eagle,\" he said. \"Come spring, you will be forging weapons from its wings,\" he said.\nI ate it up, even though I knew it was a lie. The Skyforge was for legendary smiths, and I was a wanted criminal. Unless the guard decide to quit looking for us, I was going to spend the rest of my life crafting Orcish Plate for bandits, idiots who didn't deserve my work and lacked the brains to value it.\nMaybe that's what pissed me off the most about Bjormund's tales about hearth and home. We weren't going to be welcome in Skyrim, or anywhere for that matter. We were Crimson Dirks. We had a home, and now it was gone."}

The bones of our ancestors still lie in state, though some lie in the most peculiar positions. Though I first came here to remove myself from civilization, I find myself drawn to the mystery of this place. Who were these people and how did they die? I must tell my sister, &lt;a href=\"Kala\"&gt;Kala&lt;/a&gt;, about this place when I return.\nI found meditation to be increasingly difficult today so I set about exploring. I discovered an interesting document that speaks a little to those who lived here but not much more. I keep expecting some revelation with every turned stone, and in fact I could swear I have heard or perhaps felt something at the edge of consciousness. Are the ancient ones trying to make contact with me?\nLast night, each time I started to drift to sleep, I kept thinking I could hear a voice or voices whispering in the darkness. I got precious little sleep as a result. I think I will rest here at camp today. Maybe I will explore more tomorrow.\nThere is someone or something here. I can feel it all around me. I can hear it whispering to me \u2026 whispers in the darkness. Part of me says that I should leave this place, but I must know \u2026 I must know what it is trying to say to me. If only I could understand the words \u2026 It's here again.\nThe darkness grows within me. I have been chosen for a sacred duty. I just wish \u2026 my dear Kala. My dear sister. I wish I could see you again in sweet S'ren-ja. I know I can hold this thing here, in the depths. But I shall miss you."}

Day and night his serfs worked the fields, plucking aphids and worms out by their fingernails if they had to in order to make the produce the best and most delicious in all of &lt;a href=\"High%20Rock%20%28Online%29\"&gt;High Rock&lt;/a&gt;.\nThen the Creature invaded his fields.

Sometimes, people would think they had it, dive forward to grab it, and impale themselves on tools left upon the ground! Other times, the Creature would sneak up behind them in broad daylight and push them over to break their necks!\nIt was believed that Uncle Robier was cursed somehow, and the Creature was some kind of revenge for a person he had wronged in his past. The serfs abandoned the fields, willing to risk a week in the stocks rather than death at the hands of the Creature.\nSoon Uncle Robier's fields were stripped bare by the ravenous Creature, and even he began to believe the superstition himself. He locked himself in his chateau and pleaded to &lt;a href=\"the%20Divines\"&gt;the Divines&lt;/a&gt;, but they were silent. All Robier could hear was the sound of the Creature scratching beneath the floorboards, inside the walls, and in his cupboards as it devoured all he had left to eat.\nHuddled inside his bedroom in the dark of night, Robier watched as his last candle burned itself to a nub and went out. Then the Creature devoured him as well.\nTrivia.\nAs the quest item in the Inventory, the title is \"Uncle Robier's Vegetable Garden.\""}

Sometimes he is sleeping outside the inn at night.\nAncestors.\nRoggi states that his ancestor Lenne was one of the original founders of Kynesgrove; one day Lenne explored an undiscovered &lt;a href=\"Caves%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;cave&lt;/a&gt; and was eaten by &lt;a href=\"Creatures%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;monsters&lt;/a&gt;, becoming lost along with his &lt;a href=\"Roggi%27s%20Ancestral%20Shield\"&gt;ancestral shield&lt;/a&gt;.\nMead.\nHe has a particular infatuation with &lt;a href=\"mead\"&gt;mead&lt;/a&gt;, and the majority of his dialogue is concerned with the drink, of which he regularly imbibes a significant amount. He is also a proud man who refuses to take a handout from &lt;a href=\"Iddra\"&gt;Iddra&lt;/a&gt; to pay the bar debts he owes her, even though he is constantly unable to pay those debts.\nRoggi owes Iddra quite some &lt;a href=\"Septim%20%28Coin%29\"&gt;coin&lt;/a&gt; for his mead-swilling ways at the inn; talking to both about this debt has several resolutions.\nInteractions.\n&lt;a href=\"Find%20Roggi%20Knot-Beard%27s%20Ancestral%20Shield\"&gt;Find Roggi Knot-Beard's Ancestral Shield&lt;/a&gt;.\nRoggi will give the &lt;a href=\"Last%20Dragonborn\"&gt;Dragonborn&lt;/a&gt; a miscellaneous &lt;a href=\"Quests%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;quest&lt;/a&gt; to find his ancestral shield. Once they find the shield he will offer to follow them and also becomes an option for marriage if an &lt;a href=\"Amulet%20of%20Mara%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Amulet of Mara&lt;/a&gt; is worn.\n&lt;a href=\"A%20Few%20Words%20with%20You\"&gt;A Few Words with You&lt;/a&gt;.\nIddra wants to forgive Roggi's debt, requiring a persuade, bribe or brawl.\nFollower.\nRoggi's primary &lt;a href=\"Skills%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;skills&lt;/a&gt; are &lt;a href=\"Smithing%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Smithing&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Alchemy%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Alchemy&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Enchanting%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Enchanting&lt;/a&gt;. His secondary skills are &lt;a href=\"One-Handed%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;One-Handed&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Two-Handed%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Two-Handed&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Archery%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Archery&lt;/a&gt;. His tertiary skills are &lt;a href=\"Light%20Armor%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Light Armor&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Sneak%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Sneak&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Speech\"&gt;Speech&lt;/a&gt;.\nHis default equipment is limited to his default &lt;a href=\"clothes\"&gt;clothes&lt;/a&gt;, and a &lt;a href=\"Hunting%20Bow%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;hunting bow&lt;/a&gt; with &lt;a href=\"Iron%20Arrow%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;iron arrows&lt;/a&gt;. He also starts out with a &lt;a href=\"Steel%20Dagger%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;steel dagger&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Gold%20Ruby%20Necklace%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;gold ruby necklace&lt;/a&gt;, and his ancestral shield, all of which can be removed from his inventory through trading.\nRoggi will favor light armor over heavy armor, and benefits slightly more from it, although not to a dramatic degree since his skill in both is fairly low. Likewise, his skill in one-handed weapons vs. two-handed weapons are roughly on par with each other, as is his skill in archery.\nHe is a law-abiding &lt;a href=\"citizen\"&gt;citizen&lt;/a&gt;, and will refuse to commit any &lt;a href=\"Bounty%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;crimes&lt;/a&gt; on your behalf (including &lt;a href=\"theft\"&gt;theft&lt;/a&gt; or assault). He will, however, defend you against the wrath of angered citizens and &lt;a href=\"Hold%20Guard\"&gt;guards&lt;/a&gt;.\nAlong with &lt;a href=\"Sven\"&gt;Sven&lt;/a&gt;, Roggi has the lowest level cap among all available followers, maxing out at level 20. His overall health and combat skills are quite mediocre compared to most other followers, making him one of the comparatively weakest followers. Roggi is a miner, not a professional warrior, and his stats reflect this; at level 20 a &lt;a href=\"Housecarl\"&gt;Housecarl&lt;/a&gt; or any other Warrior-type follower like &lt;a href=\"Lydia%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Lydia&lt;/a&gt; has more than 300 health, compared to only 208 for Roggi. Additionally, his primary specialization is in &lt;a href=\"Crafting%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;crafting&lt;/a&gt; skills (Smithing, Alchemy, and Enchanting).\nHis morale is only average, and he will often flee from combat if seriously injured instead of standing and fighting to the end.\nLike most followers, he can be recruited into the &lt;a href=\"Blades%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Blades&lt;/a&gt;.\nConversations.\nRoggi: \"How are the little ones?\"\nIddra: \"\"Oh, you know. &lt;a href=\"Kjeld%20the%20Younger\"&gt;Little Kjeld&lt;/a&gt; is a handful, and Froa is just so quiet.\"\"\nRoggi: \"He takes after his father, and she takes after you.\"\nIddra: \"Well, that's the good and the bad of it.\"\nIddra: \"If you like mead so much, why not go live in Riften?\"\nRoggi: \"Oh, I wouldn't be able to help them. Their skills were given by the Divines.\"\nIddra: \"Maybe you could be a taster or something.\"\nRoggi: \"Ah, but I can do that right here. Right now!\"\nRoggi: \"Have you heard about Goldenglow Meadery?\"\nIddra: \"Did something happen to it?\"\nRoggi: \"All the apiaries... it will take years to get those bees happy again.\"\nIddra: \"Do the bees need to be happy?\"\nRoggi: \"Of course! You can't make good mead without happy honey!\"\nRoggi: \"You going to be at the inn tonight?\"\n&lt;a href=\"Kjeld%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Kjeld&lt;/a&gt;: \"Not sure. Feeling like taking another trip.\"\nRoggi: \"What's your wife think of your trips?\"\nKjeld: \"They're none of her business, and none of yours either.\"\nKjeld: \"Sweltering in here.\"\nRoggi: \"I'd like the fresh air better, but this isn't so bad.\"\nKjeld: \"How do you stay cheery down in these blazes?\"\nRoggi: \"I don't know. Maybe because it makes the mead taste that much better at night.\"\nKjeld: \"Again with the mead!\"\nRoggi: \"Found another one of those vents in back near the scaffold.\"\nKjeld: \"\"Does &lt;a href=\"Dravynea%20the%20Stoneweaver\"&gt;Dravynea&lt;/a&gt; know?\"\"\nRoggi: \"She hasn't had a chance to look at it yet. Just be careful over there.\"\nKjeld: \"Always.\"\nKjeld: \"So, Roggi, when are you going to get yourself a woman?\"\nRoggi: \"Oh, I'm not sure I could ever settle down like you have, friend.\"\nKjeld: \"Who says I've settled down?\"\nRoggi: \"I think this is yet another conversation that wouldn't make your wife happy.\"\nKjeld: \"That's just it... if she's not happy, there are plenty of other women who will be.\"\nRoggi: \"Oh, you old charmer.\"\nRoggi: \"I'm not sure that's a good joke to tell with women present...\"\nKjeld: \"\"But don't you get it? She thought he was a &lt;a href=\"Troll%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;troll&lt;/a&gt;!\"\"\nRoggi: \"I get it. It's funny. It just might upset your wife.\"\nKjeld: \"Eh, let her get upset. She'll be angry no matter what I say, might as well enjoy myself.\"\nRoggi: \"How much do you know about the brewing of mead?\"\nKjeld: \"I know all there is to know about the drinking of it, and that suits me just fine.\"\nRoggi: \"\"I've been trying to figure out what makes &lt;a href=\"Black-Briar%20Mead\"&gt;Riften mead&lt;/a&gt; better than &lt;a href=\"Honningbrew%20Mead\"&gt;the stuff from Whiterun&lt;/a&gt;.\"\"\nKjeld: \"Better honey?\"\nRoggi: \"There has to be more to it than that, though. I wish I knew where the bees got it from.\"\nRoggi: \"Kjeld bothering you again?\"\n&lt;a href=\"Dravynea%20the%20Stoneweaver\"&gt;Dravynea&lt;/a&gt;: \"Nothing I can't handle.\"\nRoggi: \"Well, you send that blowhard to me if he steps over the line.\"\nRoggi: \"How's the mine today?\"\nDravynea: \"Not too bad. Careful around the more obvious scorchers.\"\nRoggi: \"As usual. I've always got an eye on the rocks.\""}

According to Sorex, Roggvir was a cruel and immature boy in his childhood, who often pulled practical jokes, such as leaving a &lt;a href=\"beehive\"&gt;beehive&lt;/a&gt; in Sorex's bed, and humiliating him whenever in the presence of Vivienne, whom Sorex had feelings for.\nWhen his sister married local &lt;a href=\"Fisherman%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;fisherman&lt;/a&gt; and stall &lt;a href=\"Vendor\"&gt;Vendor&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Addvar\"&gt;Addvar&lt;/a&gt;, Roggvir became an uncle to the young girl &lt;a href=\"Svari\"&gt;Svari&lt;/a&gt;, who was fond of him.\nRoggvir was a member of the city guard at the time of &lt;a href=\"High%20King\"&gt;High King&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Torygg\"&gt;Torygg&lt;/a&gt;'s death at the hands of &lt;a href=\"Ulfric%20Stormcloak%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Ulfric Stormcloak&lt;/a&gt;. Immediately after the incident, Roggvir, who was presumably on gate guard duty opened the city gates and allowed Ulfric to escape. For this, he was branded a traitor and sentenced to death. He was a proud Nord and &lt;a href=\"Stormcloak\"&gt;Stormcloak&lt;/a&gt; sympathizer, defending Ulfric's actions as honorable even in the face of death.\nHis sister, Greta, stopped going to the &lt;a href=\"Temple%20of%20the%20Divines%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Temple of the Divines&lt;/a&gt; after his death, while his niece Svari was also very upset. Addvar tried explaining to her that people must be held accountable for their actions, however this did not console her, but as he states \"a child feels what she will.\"\n&lt;a href=\"Captain%20Aldis\"&gt;Captain Aldis&lt;/a&gt;, who presided over his execution, respected Roggvir, labelling him as a \"fine and honorable man\" when in conversation with the &lt;a href=\"Last%20Dragonborn\"&gt;Dragonborn&lt;/a&gt;, although saying his execution was justified and necessary. Also, after the crowd disperses at the execution, he looks down at Roggvir's corpse and says, \"Damn shame Roggvir, you were a good man.\"\nInteractions.\nUpon entering &lt;a href=\"Solitude%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Solitude&lt;/a&gt; for the first time, the Dragonborn witnesses Roggvir's execution. Before death, he exclaims that Ulfric challenged Torygg in single &lt;a href=\"Combat%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;combat&lt;/a&gt;, and won honorably. As such, it was the way of the Nords to allow Ulfric to leave, as he had done nothing wrong.\nDespite his claimed innocence, Roggvir is still executed for treason. If the Dragonborn tries to stop the execution, whether by attacking the guards or simply walking onto the execution platform, Roggvir will make a run for it. If the guards are distracted long enough, he can escape. But if the Hold Guards are not distracted enough, they, &lt;a href=\"Ahtar\"&gt;Ahtar&lt;/a&gt;, and Captain Aldis will rapidly stab and kill Roggvir and the Dragonborn will be attacked, but receive no &lt;a href=\"Bounty%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;bounty&lt;/a&gt;. However, he will either disappear or drop dead if the Dragonborn attempts to speak with him, and all &lt;a href=\"Characters%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;NPCs&lt;/a&gt; still comment as if he were executed. Attacking Roggvir before he is killed will cause the guards to become hostile, but will accrue no bounty. If saved, Roggvir will sometimes go to the &lt;a href=\"grindstone\"&gt;grindstone&lt;/a&gt; near his planned execution site and work on a &lt;a href=\"Swords%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;sword&lt;/a&gt;. He will not leave the grindstone unless the Dragonborn attempts to use it.\nEntering Solitude for the first time through the side gate will cause the Dragonborn to miss the execution. However, dialogue options with NPCs will still be as if the Dragonborn had witnessed the execution (note: After taking over the city of Solitude with the Stormcloaks, the guards talk about how it is \"too bad they could not have gotten here in time to save Roggvir\"). If the Dragonborn kills Ahtar, Captain Aldis, and the guard with them before Roggvir's death, Roggvir will die shortly after, since he is programmed to die regardless of the Dragonborn's actions.\nQuests.\nSpeaking to Svari, the daughter of Roggvir's sister, Greta, about her mother starts a miscellaneous &lt;a href=\"Quests%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;quest&lt;/a&gt; to convince Greta to return to the Temple of the Divines. This entails recovering Roggvir's &lt;a href=\"Amulet%20of%20Talos%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Amulet of Talos&lt;/a&gt; off of his body and giving it to Greta. In the catacombs, the amulet is in the stone &lt;a href=\"Containers%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;coffin&lt;/a&gt; to the left of the entrance in the second alcove.\nConversations.\nSvari: \"They can't hurt uncle Roggvir. Tell them he didn't do it.\"\nAldis: \"Positions.\"\nAddvar: \"Svari, you need to go home. Go home and stay there until your mother comes.\"\nAldis: \"Lock the city gate.\"\nVivienne: \"You should tell her that her uncle is scum that betrayed his High King. Best she know now, Addvar.\"\nAddvar: \"You're all heart, Vivienne.\"\nAldis: \"Roggvir. You helped Ulfric Stormcloak escape this city after he murdered High King Torygg. By opening that gate for Ulfric you betrayed the people of Solitude.\"\nBeirand: \"Traitor!\"\nSorex: \"He doesn't deserve to speak!\"\nRoggvir: \"There was no murder! Ulfric challenged Torygg. He beat the High King in fair combat.\"\nTaarie: \"Liar!\"\nRoggvir: \"Such as our way! Such as the ancient custom of Skyrim, and all Nords!\"\nJala: \"Booooo.\"\nSorex: \"Booooo.\"\nVivienne: \"Cut 'em down!\"\nTaarie: \"Booooo.\"\nAldis: \"Guard. Prepare the prisoner.\"\nRoggvir: \"I don't need your help.\"\nAldis: \"Very well, Roggvir. Bow your head.\"\nRoggvir: \"On this day... I go to Sovngarde.\""}

Trained in &lt;a href=\"Weapons\"&gt;weapon&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"armor\"&gt;armor&lt;/a&gt; arts, rogues possess &lt;a href=\"agility\"&gt;agility&lt;/a&gt; and cunning, suiting them for a diverse role-playing experience. Rogues employ &lt;a href=\"speed\"&gt;speed&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"combat\"&gt;combat&lt;/a&gt; rather than physical prowess. &lt;a href=\"Persuasion\"&gt;Persuasive&lt;/a&gt; in conversation, a rogue's tongue is as sharp as a &lt;a href=\"Swords\"&gt;blade&lt;/a&gt;.\nIn addition to their weapon proficiencies, rogues are inclined to &lt;a href=\"Lockpicking\"&gt;pick locks&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Pickpocket\"&gt;pockets&lt;/a&gt;. Depending on their agility when their tongues fail them, rogues typically stick with &lt;a href=\"Light%20Armor\"&gt;light armor&lt;/a&gt; types.\nOblivion.\nPopular usage.\nDue to their &lt;a href=\"Light%20Armor%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;lightweight armor&lt;/a&gt; and average &lt;a href=\"Health%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;health pool&lt;/a&gt;, Rogues employ dexterity and swift reflexes to land and dodge attacks, blocking with a &lt;a href=\"Shields%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;shield&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"Weapons%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;weapon&lt;/a&gt; when necessary. Use of &lt;a href=\"Illusion%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;Illusion&lt;/a&gt; spells such as &lt;a href=\"Invisibility%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;Invisibility&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Paralyze%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;Paralyze&lt;/a&gt; can assist the Rogue with avoiding &lt;a href=\"Combat%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;combat&lt;/a&gt; altogether. Rogues do not perform well against mobs of enemies. To prevent this type of battle from taking advantage of the Rogue, employ &lt;a href=\"Spells%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;spells&lt;/a&gt; such as &lt;a href=\"Fear\"&gt;Fear&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"Demoralize\"&gt;Demoralize&lt;/a&gt; to scatter the enemies while striking them with &lt;a href=\"Arrows%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;arrows&lt;/a&gt; or bladed attacks from behind. With &lt;a href=\"Alchemy%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;Alchemy&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Poison%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;poisons&lt;/a&gt; with an array of effects can be crafted and added to blades, allowing for quicker kills.\nRogues are, by nature, dishonest, unprincipled, and mischievous characters. Despite only having\u00a0two &lt;a href=\"stealth\"&gt;stealth&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Skills%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;skills&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Light%20Armor%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;Light Armor&lt;/a&gt; and\u00a0&lt;a href=\"Mercantile%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;Mercantile&lt;/a&gt;, rogues are akin to thieves and villains. However, unlike the &lt;a href=\"Thief%20%28Class%29\"&gt;thief&lt;/a&gt;, they love getting their hands dirty, eager\u00a0to go toe to toe with any opponent when threatened. In addition, since their skills are widely varied, they could easily do all &lt;a href=\"Factions%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;factions&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Quests%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;quests&lt;/a&gt;. Illusion could help them in the &lt;a href=\"Thieves%20Guild%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;Thieves Guild&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Dark%20Brotherhood%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;Dark Brotherhood&lt;/a&gt;, the Alchemy and Illusion could aid with the &lt;a href=\"Mages%20Guild%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;Mages Guild&lt;/a&gt;, and their combat skills are well-geared for the &lt;a href=\"Fighters%20Guild%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;Fighters Guild&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Arena%20%28Faction%29\"&gt;Arena&lt;/a&gt;. With this in mind, the Rogue is one of the most versatile of the pre-made &lt;a href=\"Classes%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;classes&lt;/a&gt;."}

You might say I'm a fan of your work. But I also don't like doing business in person, so I slipped you this letter while you slept. Consider this job my apology for messing with your beauty rest.\nDon't worry, this ain't some small time caper. There's enough clink in it to fill both our cups, if you're game.\nThe mark's a fat, milk-drinking noble who just arrived in &lt;a href=\"Markarth%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Markarth&lt;/a&gt;.

But the sellsword's got one weakness - &lt;a href=\"Sujamma%20%28Dragonborn%29\"&gt;sujamma&lt;/a&gt; from his homeland. So here's what I need you to do:\nFirst, take this vial and spike some sujamma at a &lt;a href=\"Cooking%20Place\"&gt;cookpot&lt;/a&gt;, so the heat activates the poison. As for the sujamma itself, you can probably get a bottle on &lt;a href=\"Solstheim%20%28Dragonborn%29\"&gt;Solstheim&lt;/a&gt;, if none of the traders here have it. A bit out of the way, but worth it.\nOnce the sujamma's spiked, convince the innkeeper at the &lt;a href=\"Silver-Blood%20Inn\"&gt;Silver-Blood Inn&lt;/a&gt; to sell it. When the two stop by the inn, the drink will turn the Dunmer's insides out, and will keep him at the bar for a good long while.\nOnce the bodyguard's out of the way, you'll be free to pick the other's pockets. Take whatever you like, but what I need is his personal ring seal, the one he uses for letters.\nWhen you have the seal, go to the &lt;a href=\"The%20Warrens\"&gt;Warrens&lt;/a&gt;. I'll leave a note with further instructions outside the third door on your left.\n-- E"}
