It's time for me to return to &lt;a href=\"Black%20Marsh%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Black Marsh&lt;/a&gt; and do the same for my people.\"\nJorunn nodded solemnly. \"Then I can ask no more of you, my trusted friend,\" he said with a tear in his eye. \"May &lt;a href=\"Kyne\"&gt;Kyne&lt;/a&gt; guide you back home, Black Fin. And if you ever need my aid, you have but to ask.\"\nAt those words, Keshu's eyes sparkled like the stars in the sky. \"Well, there is a small matter,\" she said, and then she went on to explain how she was hoping to open Black Marsh to outsiders, especially crafters and artisans, to help expand the knowledge and experiences of her people. \"I shall put out the word,\" Jorunn agreed. \"And where should these crafters and artisans go? To &lt;a href=\"Stormhold%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Stormhold&lt;/a&gt;?\"\n\"No,\" Keshu replied. \"Send them to &lt;a href=\"Gideon\"&gt;Gideon&lt;/a&gt;.\"\nAnd that's where Keshu led us. To Gideon, the Imperial stronghold in &lt;a href=\"Murkmire\"&gt;Murkmire&lt;/a&gt;, where she was determined to establish a more inviting and vibrant \"modern\" Argonian society. Her plans, as she explained them to us during the journey, was to start out by bringing the things we learned and discovered during our time in &lt;a href=\"Morrowind%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Morrowind&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Skyrim%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Skyrim&lt;/a&gt; to Gideon, and then begin a series of quests to re-discover the secrets of the ancient Argonian civilization. \"I do not want to change our culture,\" Keshu assured us. \"I want to enhance it and bring back the glory we had and lost in ages past.\"\nWe may not have all agreed with everything Keshu outlined on our journey home, but we believed in the Black Fin. We would follow her to &lt;a href=\"Oblivion%20%28Realm%29\"&gt;Oblivion&lt;/a&gt; and back if she asked it of us. So it wasn't that far a leap to realize that we were going to help her achieve her dream for our people.\nAs we approach the borders of &lt;a href=\"Murkmire\"&gt;Murkmire&lt;/a&gt;, this ongoing narrative comes to an end. I may write again in the future, but I imagine that my free time will evaporate like a small puddle on a hot day as soon as we get settled in Gideon. But if you ever make it to our fair city, stop by and say hello. We welcome all visitors\u2014Argonians and dryskins alike!"}

{"id": "924667", "revid": "10356255", "url": "https://elderscrolls.fandom.com/wiki?curid=924667", "title": "The Black Hand", "text": "The Black Hand is a &lt;a href=\"Books%20%28Dark%20Brotherhood%29\"&gt;book&lt;/a&gt; in .\nContents.\nBy &lt;a href=\"Geon%20Alinie\"&gt;Geon Alinie&lt;/a&gt;, Chronicler-at-Large\nMy in-depth investigation of the clandestine organization known only as the &lt;a href=\"Dark%20Brotherhood%20%28Online%20Faction%29\"&gt;Dark Brotherhood&lt;/a&gt; has been a long and difficult process. But after years of research, countless interviews, and no small amount of good luck, I've finally been able to put together a profile of the assassin cult's ruling body - the notorious Black Hand. While much of what follows has been augmented by theory and conjecture, the basis upon which I constructed the profile is undeniably factual and true.\nSo, what group of individuals is strong enough to command the assassins of the Dark Brotherhood? A group called the Black Hand. Like any hand, the group consists of five members: four fingers and a thumb, as it were. The members corresponding to the fingers are called the Speakers, while the member representing the thumb is called the Listener. These are titles and ranks, and as ridiculous as they may sound to anyone not steeped in the lore of the cult, the assassins take these terms very seriously.\nNow, I need to explain an even stranger concept. It will sound unbelievable, and it may very well be nothing but a legend used to keep the lesser assassins in line, but from everything I've been able to uncover, the cult holds fast to this concept. They claim that a near-deific figure known as either the Shadow Matriarch, the Dark Woman, or the Night Mother leads the Dark Brotherhood. Apparently no one ever sees this Dark Woman. Instead, she whispers commands to the Listener, who then selects one of the Speakers to pass the command along. And, yes, most of these commands relate to murder.\nWhat does the Listener hear? Details, as you can imagine, are sketchy, but an educated guess allows us to assume that the Dark Woman provides either the name of the client of the target that has been named for the kill. The Listener passes this information on to one of the Speakers, who then either personally selects an assassin to carry out the deed or provides the information to a minor functionary to assign the contract.\nNow, as far as I can tell, the assassins don't all gather in one place. Instead, the cult divides its members into small, self-sufficient units known as either Havens, Sanctuaries, Shelters, or Assassin Ports. Again, details on these topics are often fluid and even contradictory, but I have done my best to make sense of the stillness within the noise. The leader of these Havens, which seem to be established in specific geographic locations as to spread the assassin's reach far and wide, is either called a Dame or a Matron (although one source referred to her as a Widow, but the other names were much more common in my research). The Speaker can pass along orders to this subordinate and have her select the assassin best-suited to carry out the deed.\nFinally, I was able to ascertain that each Speaker commands a personal assassin. For truly special missions, I can only assume. I'm not sure if these personal assassins are considered wrists or knuckles of some other body part, but I did learn that they are possibly granted the title of Quieter, or maybe Husher, or even Silencer. Something menacing and ridiculous like that. These are supposedly the best of the best, master killers without peer. Whether they constitute as members of the Black Hand or not, I was never able to determine, nor did I come across information concerning how they receive their orders.\nThe Dark Brotherhood. The Black Hand. Melodramatic names for a demented cult of killers - but they are killers, all the same."}

When trapping souls, any compatible soul gem in the inventory will be used before the Black Star.\nWhile Nelacar claims the Black Star can house only black souls, it can actually hold souls of any type, like standard black soul gems (note: this is more of a developer oversight than a bug/glitch). Considering the abundance of enemies with black souls and the scarcity of enemies with Grand-level white souls, the Black Star is recommended over Azura's Star for players who want to develop the &lt;a href=\"Enchanting%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Enchanting&lt;/a&gt; skill at a fast pace, especially when used in conjunction with soul-trapping weapons such as &lt;a href=\"Mace%20of%20Molag%20Bal%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Mace of Molag Bal&lt;/a&gt;.

Unfortunately for him, one of the properties of the Star was that black souls\u2014the souls of sapient, mortal beings\u2014could not enter it. As such, he began experiments to modify the Star's properties so that it would accept black souls.\nThe further Malyn progressed toward this goal, the more &lt;a href=\"Azura\"&gt;Azura&lt;/a&gt; tormented him for violating her artifact with his dark intentions. The artifact slowly drove Malyn insane, causing him to hear voices and see people that were not there, and eventually murder one of his students. After this, he was exiled from the college, collected a band of followers, and continued his research at &lt;a href=\"Ilinalta%27s%20Deep\"&gt;Ilinalta's Deep&lt;/a&gt;, an abandoned &lt;a href=\"Imperial%20Legion%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Imperial&lt;/a&gt; outpost that had mostly collapsed into the &lt;a href=\"Lake%20Ilinalta\"&gt;adjacent lake&lt;/a&gt;. There, he continued his work, eventually succeeding in capturing his own soul inside the modified Azura's Star and achieving a state of immortality.\nTo receive this quest, the &lt;a href=\"Last%20Dragonborn\"&gt;Dragonborn&lt;/a&gt; must first talk with &lt;a href=\"Aranea%20Ienith\"&gt;Aranea Ienith&lt;/a&gt; at the &lt;a href=\"Shrine%20of%20Azura%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Shrine of Azura&lt;/a&gt;, south of &lt;a href=\"Winterhold%20%28Skyrim%20City%29\"&gt;Winterhold&lt;/a&gt;, which can be easily seen due to the giant statue of Azura that towers over the surrounding mountains. She will say that Azura has chosen the Dragonborn as her champion, and that they must find \"an elven mage who can turn the brightest star to the darkest night.\"\nHead to Winterhold. Once there, there are a few options to gain the identity of the \"elven mage\":\nWhen talking to Nelacar, he will not give up the information readily, so one must intimidate, persuade, or bribe the necessary information out of him. He will say that his mentor, Malyn Varen, was experimenting with Azura's Star, and that the last known location of Malyn was Ilinalta's Deep.\nIlinalta's Deep can be found west of &lt;a href=\"Riverwood%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Riverwood&lt;/a&gt;, near and to the north of &lt;a href=\"The%20Lady%20Stone%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;The Lady Stone&lt;/a&gt;. There is a trap door atop a partially submerged tower that leads into the underground complex.\n&lt;a href=\"Ilinalta%27s%20Deep\"&gt;Ilinalta's Deep&lt;/a&gt;.\nAfter entering, the Dragonborn should go past the shackled skeleton and enter a flooded room with a partially open doorway on the left. They must go through the doorway and down the subsequent hallway. Following the hallway is a small room containing a &lt;a href=\"Skeleton%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;skeleton&lt;/a&gt; and the first of many &lt;a href=\"Conjurer%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;conjurers&lt;/a&gt; (&lt;a href=\"Necromancer%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;necromancers&lt;/a&gt; at higher levels) found throughout the dungeon. In the next room are two more conjurers, and a skeleton lurks in the room on the left, which contains some &lt;a href=\"Food%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;food&lt;/a&gt; and a &lt;a href=\"Potions%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;potion&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"Waterbreathing%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;waterbreathing&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe door on the right leads to the next area, with a conjurer, a skeleton, and a dead &lt;a href=\"Wolf%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;wolf&lt;/a&gt;, which will be raised from the dead if the mage is alerted. The underwater passage behind the waterfall on the left leads to a hidden room with a &lt;a href=\"Containers%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;chest&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Alteration%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Alteration&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Skill%20Books%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;skill book&lt;/a&gt;, \"&lt;a href=\"Breathing%20Water\"&gt;Breathing Water&lt;/a&gt;\", floating near the ceiling.\nThe right-hand passage in the next room leads to two conjurers and a skeleton. There is a small sleeping quarters to the left, as well as an &lt;a href=\"arcane%20enchanter\"&gt;arcane enchanter&lt;/a&gt;, an &lt;a href=\"Alchemy%20Lab%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;alchemy lab&lt;/a&gt;, and several useful pieces of loot. The door on the right has an apprentice lock, with a chest and some potions on the other side.\nAt the end of the next passage is a high-level conjurer, on the far side of a flooded depression that cuts across the room. There is a partially submerged stairway on the far right side of the depression that can be used to approach the conjurer from the safety of the water. Under the water near the stairs is a door with an adept lock. Loot on the other side includes a chest containing a &lt;a href=\"Spell%20Tomes%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;spell tome&lt;/a&gt;, potions, and .\nBack in the partially flooded area, there is an altar with a leveled soul gem on the right and a pull chain on the left that raises the bridge across the water that was just crossed. A door on the left leads to a passage containing a cupboard and an apprentice-locked door on the right that opens onto a small room with a couple of potions and &lt;a href=\"Alchemy%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;alchemical&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Ingredients%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;ingredients&lt;/a&gt;. Up the stairs on the far side of the room is a barred door. The protagonist must activate the bar to move it and go through the door to come onto a small landing area overlooking the first room of the dungeon. Following the landing to the right and through another door leads to the final section of the dungeon, Ilinalta's Deluge. Be advised, once the normal boss necromancer of the dungeon is slain, marking the location as \"cleared,\" a stone ramp will appear in the original entry room, serving as a shortcut to the door to Ilinalta's Deluge without having to explore the rest of the dungeon again. It will be on the right upon entering the room from the original entrance.\nThe Dragonborn should then follow the path down to reach an area with two conjurers. There is a chest, and quite a few potions and soul gems scattered throughout this room and the smaller one to the right. The passage to the left leads down a path, through another door, and into a room occupied by a conjurer and a skeleton, with cages along both walls. Through the door at the end of the room is a set of stairs opening onto a medium-sized room with a high-level conjurer and four skeletons. There is no loot in here, so the Dragonborn should continue straight up the stairs to the left.\nIn the room at the top of the stairs, Malyn Varen's skeleton sits peacefully in a chair, with the &lt;a href=\"Broken%20Azura%27s%20Star\"&gt;Broken Azura's Star&lt;/a&gt; at its feet, his &lt;a href=\"Malyn%20Varen%27s%20Grimoire\"&gt;grimoire&lt;/a&gt; on the floor next to his chair. Also in the room is a chest with a leveled amount of loot. With the Broken Azura's Star in hand, the dungeon can be exited via the ladder that leads to the ceiling.\nCleansing the Star.\nThere are now two options to fix the Broken Azura's Star:\nIf the option to serve Azura is chosen, a small conversation with the goddess takes place:\n\"Greetings, mortal. You have followed my guidance through the veils of Twilight and rescued my Star from Malyn Varen. But his soul still resides within, protected by his enchantments. Until he is purged, my artifact is useless to you.\"\nIf left in dialogue:\n\"Are you ready to enter the Star and purge the soul of Malyn Varen?\"\nAfter defeating Malyn:\n\"The Star is free to purify itself. Don't worry, mortal. I will return you before you are cleansed.\"\n\"My Star has been restored and Malyn's soul has been consigned to Oblivion. You have done well, mortal. As was destined, you are free to use my Star as you see fit.\"\nSpeaking to the desired person, with the Broken Azura's Star in hand, will begin this final step. Whichever option is chosen, the Dragonborn must enter the Star to cleanse it of Malyn Varen's soul. The former is warped out of the Star several seconds after defeating the latter's soul inside, regardless of the status of Malyn's three &lt;a href=\"Dremora%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Dremora&lt;/a&gt; henchmen.\nOnce Malyn's soul has been defeated, the Dragonborn is pulled out of the Star, thanked, and given either a working Azura's Star by Aranea Ienith, or the Black Star by Nelacar. The former can trap only white souls (those of non-sapient creatures) while the latter, according to Nelacar, can trap only black souls (the souls of sapient beings). In reality, however, the Black Star can hold either white or black souls, just like a &lt;a href=\"Black%20Soul%20Gem%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;black soul gem&lt;/a&gt;.\nAdditionally, bringing the Star to Aranea makes her available as a &lt;a href=\"Followers%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;follower&lt;/a&gt;. While giving the Star to Nelacar does not provide a companion option, the Black Star has the advantage of a much more abundant source of grand souls, as all black souls are of the grand level. Meanwhile, only white souls from exceptionally powerful monsters such as the &lt;a href=\"Mammoth%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;mammoth&lt;/a&gt;, are grand souls. Giving the Star to Nelacar also opens up another merchant, as he will afterwards sell &lt;a href=\"Mage%20Robes\"&gt;Mage Robes&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Spell%20Tomes%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;spell tomes&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Soul%20Gem%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;soul gems&lt;/a&gt;, and the occasional &lt;a href=\"Staves%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;staff&lt;/a&gt;."}

After much searching, I discovered an entrance to a pocket realm within the Evergloam, a place known only as the Crow's Wood. Similar in its ominous feel to the rest of &lt;a href=\"Nocturnal%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Nocturnal's&lt;/a&gt; mysterious realm, the &lt;a href=\"Crow%27s%20Wood\"&gt;Crow's Wood&lt;/a&gt; appears as a dark marsh full of dangerous creatures. Most notably, a murder of intelligent, talking crows inhabits the area and considers the place to be its personal kingdom. Here is what I learned during my brief sojourn to the Crow's Wood.\nThe crows organize themselves using a feudal system and refer to their flock as the &lt;a href=\"Blackfeather%20Court\"&gt;Blackfeather Court&lt;/a&gt;. These birds claim to be the spawn of a &lt;a href=\"Hagraven%20%28Online%29\"&gt;hagraven&lt;/a&gt; they call the &lt;a href=\"Crow%20Mother\"&gt;Crow Mother&lt;/a&gt;, and they constantly strive to defend their domain from &lt;a href=\"Wolf%20%28Online%29\"&gt;wolves&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Giant%20Bat%20%28Online%29\"&gt;giant bats&lt;/a&gt;, and other predatory creatures that roam the shadowy realm. The Duke of Crows leads the Court. This large, proud bird presides over the rest of the flock because, as he tells it, he's \"the smartest and biggest and loudest\" crow in the murder. Indeed, for these noisy, talkative birds, the ability to stand out among the crowd is considered not only a necessity, but a symbol of prestige. The rest of the flock clusters and conspires around the Duke of Crows, engaging in their insistent plotting and politicking for status and favor.\nNot that the &lt;a href=\"Duke%20of%20Crows\"&gt;Duke of Crows&lt;/a&gt; appears to do much more than preen and bluster. The real work of the Blackfeather Court, such as it is, falls to the &lt;a href=\"Seneschal%20of%20Carrion\"&gt;Seneschal of Carrion&lt;/a&gt; and the Court Castellan. Both of these birds serve the Duke of Crows, but they evidently have the freedom and authority to perform independently to keep the Court operating efficiently\u2014or, at least as efficiently as any group of intelligent birds can manage. The Seneschal of Carrion takes care of the assorted domestic arrangements for the Court, as well as acting as the steward for the Duke of Crows. The Seneschal also adjudicates the various tributes of death and carnage regularly heaped upon the Court. (Although to be fair, except for the tributes they requested of me, I saw no one else seeking the favor of the Duke of Crows and his flock during my visit.) The Court Castellan, on the other hand (wing?), acts as the governor of the Court. This involves overseeing the various knights and knaves that serve the Court, including the Knights of Marrow, Pith, Gore, and Vitreous, and the Knaves of Rooks, Pipes, and Ravens. As with everything surrounding the Court, there appears to be more attention paid to pomp and circumstance than to actually accomplishing anything of substance.\nEventually, it falls to the Bursar of Tributes, a feathered accountant of sorts, to sort and catalog the tributes of death and carnage that add to the Court's ever-growing hoard of shiny objects. The crows charge visitors who enter the realm, either a toll of flesh or silver, to grant temporary safe passage through the Crow's Wood. Anyone who refuses to pay, be they featherless tourists or birds of a different persuasion, is subject to any and every disgrace and degradation the crows can come up with, including incessant cawing, pecking, and foul droppings on heads and fancy clothing. I paid the toll for an opportunity to wander among the Court and talk to its members, but it isn't clear to me that such a payment was absolutely necessary. They are just crows, after all.\nAs I prepared to depart the Crow's Wood, the Knave of Ravens sidled over to me, fixed me with her curious sideways gaze, and uttered this ominous proclamation: \"Pay attention, featherless cur! Today the Blackfeather Court rules the Crow's Wood. But tomorrow? Tomorrow the Night Mistress has grander plans for our respected murder!\" The word followed me back to &lt;a href=\"Tamriel\"&gt;Tamriel&lt;/a&gt;, along with an echo of caws. \"Murder!\"\nI may never feel completely safe around a gathering of birds again."}

We've fixed them upon you for some time. We're in need of an outsider, unknown in Cormount. Someone with... versatility.\"\nAfter heading through his portal, you will find yourself in a room with several other people. Speak to Maeroth here and he will tell you the following:\n\"Cormount is where the Blacksap Rebellion began. With your help, Cormount will be where it ends. The Vinedusk Rangers need you to flush out the Blacksap leaders. Killing them will only fuel the flames of rebellion. They must be brought into custody.\"\nYou can talk to Gelthior now, or you can use the portal to get back. If you speak with Gelthior, he will tell you that he wants his sons to be captured; the rebellion has been crushed, and fighting on only leads to more heartbreak. He will tell you that if &lt;a href=\"Lorchon\"&gt;Lorchon&lt;/a&gt; knows his father is alive, he will come peacefully, but that &lt;a href=\"Gorinir\"&gt;Gorinir&lt;/a&gt; is another matter. After speaking with Gelthior, speak with Forinor again and he will create a portal for you to travel back to Elden Root.\nOnce back, head north to &lt;a href=\"Cormount%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Cormount&lt;/a&gt;. Head up the foyer in the center of town, then up another foyer to meet with &lt;a href=\"Treethane%20Iirdel\"&gt;Treethane Iirdel&lt;/a&gt;. You will find her amidst a heated discussion about whether someone has eaten a potato. Iiridel will tell you that it is probably best to go after Lorchon first, and that the Blacksap use a list of special code words to communicate. She has discovered some of these and written them down in &lt;a href=\"Iirdel%27s%20Journal\"&gt;her journal&lt;/a&gt;, which is lying next to her. \nHead out and talk to the sympathizers listed in the journal. The phrazes you should say to them depend on the weather, as well as the colour of the flame at the altar under the inn in the north of town. Alternatively, you may simply persuade them with the fact that you are the one who killed &lt;a href=\"General%20Endare\"&gt;General Endare&lt;/a&gt;, the \"Jade Butcher\" who crushed the rebellion. Once you have discovered Lorchon's location, head to the center of town and speek with the Treethane. She will give you a set of rings that used to belong to Gelthior, though they are enchanted to teleport the wearer to Gelthior's prison. She will tell you to give one to Lorchon at your meeting. \nYour meeting with Lorchon will take place west of town, at the &lt;a href=\"Battle%20of%20Cormount%20Memorial\"&gt;Battle of Cormount Memorial&lt;/a&gt;. You will have to fight your way through some hostile &lt;a href=\"Blacksap%20Recruit\"&gt;Blacksap Recruit&lt;/a&gt;s, but once you reach the center of the area, Lorchon will appear. When you tell him his father is still alive, he will surrender and tell you where to find his brother Gorinir. Gorinir is located in a cave on the other side of town. After telling you this, Lorchin will put on the ring and be transported away. \nHead east of town to the dead end in the road, and you will find an ancient cave there. On the other end of this cave, you will find Gorinir; speak with him and he will tell you he has a plan in motion to rid the region of the Dominion. If you intimidate him, he will surrender and give you a brew that might help you stop the constructs that he set upon the Dominion camps in the area. If you do not intimidate him, . You can give him his father's ring afterward, and it will transport him to his father's prison. \nHead to the Dominion camps set up southwest of Cormount and slay the &lt;a href=\"Lurcher%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Lurchers&lt;/a&gt; there. There should be one per camp, accompanied by some wisps. The brew Gorinir gave you can help, but using it is not necessary. Once all four have been defeated, Forinor will contact you and tell you to meet with the Vinedusk Rangers in town. When you get there, Forinor will open a portal to the prison so that you can talk to Maeroth. Speak with him there to finish the quest."}

Imperial forces had won a great and decisive victory in the &lt;a href=\"Battle%20of%20Argonia\"&gt;Battle of Argonia&lt;/a&gt;, as well as in several other clashes. These battles were one-sided affairs, with &lt;a href=\"Argonians%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Argonians&lt;/a&gt; suffering significant casualties and Imperials hardly getting winded. By &lt;a href=\"First%20Seed\"&gt;First Seed&lt;/a&gt; 1E 2811, the Lizard-Folk were in full retreat\u2014taking refuge in the shadowy depths of the region's interior. The Empire decided to press the advantage and mount a full-scale invasion before the Argonians could regroup.\nThe column was led by a young and charismatic commander named &lt;a href=\"Augurius%20Bucco\"&gt;Augurius Bucco&lt;/a&gt;. Bucco was a popular figure in &lt;a href=\"Cyrodiil%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Cyrodiil&lt;/a&gt;. His good looks and practiced oratory catapulted him through the ranks of the Legion hierarchy with unprecedented speed. By the time he was twenty-five he was already wearing the &lt;a href=\"General%27s%20Diamond\"&gt;General's Diamond&lt;/a&gt;. Upon receiving his generalship he was offered legions in practically every corner of Cyrodiil. He chose the &lt;a href=\"Fourth%20Legion\"&gt;Fourth Legion&lt;/a&gt; of Black Marsh as his command.\nOther historians have offered countless theories as to why he would choose such a bleak and dangerous post. As for me, I would propose that simple pride was the determining factor. Rumors of the Legion's successes along the Black Marsh border had reached the inns and alleys of &lt;a href=\"Imperial%20City%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Imperial City&lt;/a&gt; as early as &lt;a href=\"Rain%27s%20Hand\"&gt;Rain's Hand&lt;/a&gt;, 1E 2811. Seeing the swamp's conquest as his ticket to Grand Marshal, Bucco greedily took on the mantle of Fourth Legion commander, convinced the war for Black Marsh would be a quick and glorious affair. He could not have been more wrong."}

The army which had claimed hundreds of victories on the rolling fields of &lt;a href=\"Cyrodiil%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Cyrodiil&lt;/a&gt; was utterly unprepared to deal with the fetid bogs of &lt;a href=\"Black%20Marsh%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Black Marsh&lt;/a&gt;.\nTo begin with, the Legion's gear was ill-suited for such an environment. Their armor, for instance, was &lt;a href=\"Heavy%20Armor%20%28Online%29\"&gt;heavy&lt;/a&gt; and prone to rust in the moist climate. Legionnaires spent hours scraping the mud from their boots and shields\u2014desperately trying to lighten the load they carried into battle. By the end of the second year, legionnaires had abandoned their &lt;a href=\"cuirass\"&gt;cuirass&lt;/a&gt;es and &lt;a href=\"greaves\"&gt;greaves&lt;/a&gt; entirely, preferring to die comfortably rather than drenched in sweat inside a metal suit.\nThe battle tactics the Imperials had developed over the centuries were just as useless as their armor in this inhospitable place. Their system of cohort deployment and rigid line organization was impossible to implement in the swampy interior. The thick cypress growth and sloppy terrain consistently fragmented the group, resulting in a tangled mass of small skirmishes that the &lt;a href=\"Argonians%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Argonians&lt;/a&gt; routinely won. The chain of command deteriorated quickly in such conditions. This rapidly gave way to rampant insubordination and morale-draining power struggles among the troops.\nFinally, the marsh itself seemed to devour whole cohorts time and time again. Rumors and half-truths constantly swirled around Legion campfires. Some assumed that the missing cohorts became lost and disoriented, dying of hunger and thirst before finding their way back to a safe location. Others blamed the greatly feared \"&lt;a href=\"Ghost%20Warriors\"&gt;Ghost Warriors&lt;/a&gt;,\" pale and hideous Argonians of gruesome reputation. There were even whisperings about some dark and malevolent creature lurking under the swamp that ate whole phalanxes in a single bite. Such rumors were clearly false, but had a significant impact on troop morale.\nThis complication of setbacks and circumstances set the stage for years of calamitous warfare. Thousands of soldiers would die before the end of hostilities finally came to Black Marsh."}

Endless raids, disease, and mysterious disappearances were compounding on each other, creating a culture of utter hopelessness and cynicism.\nSeeing that the cause would be lost without reinforcements, Bucco called for an additional legion to be deployed to &lt;a href=\"Black%20Marsh%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Black Marsh&lt;/a&gt;. Rather than shifting these fresh troops to the front to relieve his beleaguered force, he set them to work building the \"&lt;a href=\"Reman%20Way\"&gt;Reman Way&lt;/a&gt;\" (later known as the &lt;a href=\"Swamp%20Road\"&gt;Swamp Road&lt;/a&gt;). Almost no one knew where the road went or what purpose it would serve in future conflicts, but Bucco was convinced that a well-paved and well-defended road would aid the war effort and turn the tides of battle in the legion's favor.\nIn theory, the road should have been a boon to the Imperials. Lack of supplies had long been a thorn in the legion's side. A secure supply train would mean more frequent troop rotation and an uninterrupted flow of food, water, and equipment. Alas, the road would never be completed.\nThe Reman Way fell under attack almost as soon as the work began. Waves of &lt;a href=\"Argonians%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Argonians&lt;/a&gt; crashed upon the workers day in and day out. Troopers who should have been armed with shield and spear were forced to defend themselves with shovels and lengths of chain. Soldiers also routinely succumbed to exhaustion and swamp fever. The road made it only half-way to the front lines before construction was abandoned. The Swamp Road project would long be remembered after the Black Marsh campaign came to a bitter end as \"&lt;a href=\"Bucco%27s%20Folly\"&gt;Bucco's Folly&lt;/a&gt;.\""}

What few troops remained were completely unable to defend themselves. After a near mutiny almost saw Bucco ousted from his own command, he finally ordered his remaining soldiers to retreat and exit the Marsh's interior. His prevailing assumption was that if the legion left the swamp, the &lt;a href=\"Argonians%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Argonians&lt;/a&gt; would not follow.\nAfter a withering ten-day withdrawal, what was left of the legion rallied at the foot of an ancient Argonian pyramid known as \"&lt;a href=\"Xi-tsei\"&gt;Xi-tsei&lt;/a&gt;.\" The force consisted of barely three-hundred-and-fifty swords by that point. Bucco hoped that after a brief respite in the shadow of the pyramid, his remaining forces could fall back to the relative safety of &lt;a href=\"Cyrodiil%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Cyrodiil&lt;/a&gt;. This wish went unfulfilled. On the night of Last Seed 14, 1E 2820, what remained of Bucco's proud Fourth Legion was annihilated.\nThe specifics of the Xi-tsei massacre are a matter of much debate in the historical community. While there is broad agreement that Bucco's remaining forces were destroyed by a massive Argonian war party, the evidence supporting such a conclusion is spotty at best. Archaeological excavations around the pyramid found hundreds of bodies and discarded weapons, but the remains of at least one-hundred legionnaires were never recovered. This, of course, begs the question: what happened to those soldiers? There is no evidence that they were able to make it back to Cyrodiil, which leads to the possibility that they were taken prisoner. But excavations around known war camps have found no evidence of legionnaire prisoners, either. This is just another in a series of mysterious disappearances that occurred during the conflict. Argonians may know more, but none have volunteered the information to any historians.\nThis crushing defeat in &lt;a href=\"Black%20Marsh%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Black Marsh&lt;/a&gt; was the last embarrassment that the &lt;a href=\"Imperial%20Council\"&gt;Imperial Council&lt;/a&gt; could stand. Other hostile forces looked to Black Marsh and became emboldened by the apparent weakness of the once-dreaded Legion. In response to this, the Council reconstituted the Fourth Legion under the command of General &lt;a href=\"Regulus%20Sardecus\"&gt;Regulus Sardecus&lt;/a&gt; and began the second campaign of the &lt;a href=\"Blackwater%20War\"&gt;Blackwater War&lt;/a&gt;."}

A veteran of countless campaigns, Sardecus had distinguished himself on many occasions as both a soldier and a general.\nSardecus (or Sardecus the Rock) was everything that the missing and assumed slain &lt;a href=\"General%20Bucco\"&gt;General Bucco&lt;/a&gt; was not. Eyewitness accounts depict him as a stout and humorless man with sharp, hawk-like features. He walked with a limp (a lingering injury from the &lt;a href=\"Battle%20of%20Argonia\"&gt;Battle of Argonia&lt;/a&gt;) and spoke in short, sentences that commanded obedience. He eschewed all formal dress and regalia, preferring to wear a simple centurion's panoply with a white crest to signify his station.\nSardecus and the reconstituted &lt;a href=\"Fourth%20Legion\"&gt;Fourth Legion&lt;/a&gt; wasted no time resuming the war effort. By &lt;a href=\"1E%202823\"&gt;1E 2823&lt;/a&gt;, they had regained all the territory lost when Bucco retreated. Military scholars attribute this success to Sardecus' adaptability and tactical creativity. For instance, Sardecus ordered that all legionnaires abandon their metal armor in favor of padded leather jackets. Imperial quartermasters coordinated with &lt;a href=\"Argonians%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Argonian&lt;/a&gt; irregulars and scouts\u2014 learning how to subsist on food procured from the swamp alone. Also, centurions and legates were given additional authority such that they could fight independently when the legion became fractured. Allowing cohorts and maniples to function independently had a surprisingly positive effect on soldier morale. For the first time, legionnaires were able to see their primary commanders and could follow them into battle personally. Of course, much depended on the proficiency and leadership capabilities of the legates. But Sardecus was a notoriously demanding commander and would not hesitate to strip a soldier of rank if he or she fell short of expectations.\nSardecus' greatest success, however, was in the diplomatic arena. Early in the conflict, he reached out to disenfranchised Argonian tribes and offered them rewards for joining the war effort on the side of the Empire. The fallen Bucco (and many of his contemporaries) viewed the Lizard-Folk as a singular bloc of barbarians, united by low breeding and savage tempers. Sardecus saw through this deception almost immediately. He secured solid alliances with several influential tribes, including the treacherous &lt;a href=\"Archein\"&gt;Archein&lt;/a&gt;s and &lt;a href=\"Shoss-kaleel\"&gt;Shoss-kaleel&lt;/a&gt;. Suddenly his forces were nearly tripled. The war for &lt;a href=\"Black%20Marsh%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Black Marsh&lt;/a&gt; was finally swinging in the Empire's favor."}

Disease accounted for roughly half of all fatalities in the first campaign, followed closely by mysterious disappearances. By his estimation, Argonian raids stood at a distant third. With these facts in mind, he created a new war doctrine and disseminated it to all of his officers. The crux of the strategy was simple: the only way to conquer &lt;a href=\"Black%20Marsh%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Black Marsh&lt;/a&gt; was to destroy it.\nSardecus deployed entire cohorts of engineers and sappers to the front lines. While &lt;a href=\"Imperial%20Legion%20%28Online%29\"&gt;legionnaires&lt;/a&gt; launched punishing raids on border villages, the supporting troops drained swamps, salted rice paddies, and felled hundreds of trees. The most well-known event of this portion of the war was the \"&lt;a href=\"Great%20Burn\"&gt;Great Burn&lt;/a&gt;\" of &lt;a href=\"1E%202828\"&gt;1E 2828&lt;/a&gt;.\nRecords indicate that in early &lt;a href=\"Rain%27s%20Hand\"&gt;Rain's Hand&lt;/a&gt; 1E 2828, &lt;a href=\"Elissia%20Mallicius\"&gt;Elissia Mallicius&lt;/a&gt; (one of Sardecus' most-trusted legates) ordered a unit of sappers to set fire to a peat bog outside of &lt;a href=\"Stormhold\"&gt;Stormhold&lt;/a&gt;. The sappers did as they were told, not knowing that the bog was just one part of a massive underground network. Months passed before legionnaires started reporting random fires as far away as &lt;a href=\"Soulrest\"&gt;Soulrest&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Gideon\"&gt;Gideon&lt;/a&gt;. It took several more months before the Legion realized that the entire region was on fire.\nAn inferno of burning peat and detritus raged underfoot for more than three years. The already deadly Marsh became so dangerous that the Legion was forced to give ground for the first time in the better part of a decade. Choking fumes and thundering eruptions of burning swamp gas made the area nearly uninhabitable, even for Argonians. Hundreds of species of unique flora and fauna were rendered extinct, and entire tribes of Argonians were lost. Even the Legion suffered significant casualties. Hundreds of soldiers were lost to \"&lt;a href=\"Swamp%20Lung\"&gt;swamp lung&lt;/a&gt;\" and gas explosions before they escaped the scalding heat of the fire. It was a devastating blow to both the Legion and the Argonians. This marked the end of the second campaign, and the end of Sardecus' tenure as general. Soon after the legion's retreat, he fell ill and passed to &lt;a href=\"Aetherius\"&gt;Aetherius&lt;/a&gt; before making it back to &lt;a href=\"Imperial%20City%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Imperial City&lt;/a&gt;. The official diagnosis was acute infection from a wound he sustained on the way out of the Marsh. The soldiers of the Legion weren't so sure.\nThe true circumstances of Sardecus' death are still a matter of historical debate. As for me, I do not rule out &lt;a href=\"Shadowscale\"&gt;Shadowscale&lt;/a&gt; involvement. While we know next to nothing about their organization or methodology, I think that we can safely assume they played some role in the conflict. The mysterious death of a high-ranking general directly following a disaster like the Great Burn ... If my study of history has taught me anything, it's that there is no such thing as coincidence."}

While the primary combatants were essentially the same, the first, second, and third campaigns had almost nothing in common with one another. By the year &lt;a href=\"1E%202833\"&gt;1E 2833&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"Imperial%20Legion%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Imperial&lt;/a&gt; strategy had been so heavily revised that it was barely recognizable as Imperial. While \"Sardecus' Reforms\" had reorganized the Legion, the \"&lt;a href=\"Falco%20Doctrine\"&gt;Falco Doctrine&lt;/a&gt;\" was the true catalyst that drove the war's endgame.\nGeneral &lt;a href=\"Lucinia%20Falco\"&gt;Lucinia Falco&lt;/a&gt; took command of the Legion shortly after Sardecus' passing. She was the natural choice: a close confidant of Sardecus; strong, fiercely loyal to the &lt;a href=\"Empire\"&gt;Empire&lt;/a&gt;; and utterly ruthless. She received her officer's commission shortly after the &lt;a href=\"Battle%20of%20Argonia\"&gt;Battle of Argonia&lt;/a&gt;, which meant that her entire military career had been shaped by the Blackwater War. Unlike her predecessors, she knew that the battle could not be won on a single front. She urged the Empire to offer letters of marque and temporary commissions to the countless &lt;a href=\"pirate\"&gt;pirate&lt;/a&gt;s off the coast of &lt;a href=\"Lilmoth\"&gt;Lilmoth&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Archon\"&gt;Archon&lt;/a&gt;. Working in conjunction with a legion of &lt;a href=\"Diamond%20Marines\"&gt;Diamond Marines&lt;/a&gt;, this force succeeded in taking vast swaths of territory in the southeastern marshes and even parts of the interior swamp.\nUsing &lt;a href=\"Gideon\"&gt;Gideon&lt;/a&gt; as her base of operations, Falco launched the second prong in the region-wide attack. Rather than sending out a full legion as her predecessors had done, she broke her force into hundreds of compact, highly lethal units. These expeditionary platoons (later referred to as \"&lt;a href=\"redbelts\"&gt;redbelts&lt;/a&gt;\") were led by grizzled swamp veterans\u2014some of which had been serving since the inception of the second campaign.\nThe redbelts met with a great deal of success early on, claiming most of western &lt;a href=\"Black%20Marsh%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Black Marsh&lt;/a&gt; before finally grinding to a halt outside the thick bogs and eerie silence of the region's core. Unfortunately, given each unit's size, they could not hold what they took for long. What began as a battle of two nations became a protracted and complex guerrilla war, replete with all the horrors associated with such a conflict. &lt;a href=\"1E%202834\"&gt;1E 2834&lt;/a&gt; to &lt;a href=\"1E%202836\"&gt;2836&lt;/a&gt; was a dark time for both sides. The &lt;a href=\"Argonians%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Argonians&lt;/a&gt; and the Imperials each conducted campaigns of intimidation and terror. It was only the tribal infighting on the part of the Argonians that finally brought the war to a close. Rather than an official armistice, the war seemed to simply end in late 1E 2836. Argonians who had been fighting Imperials for decades abruptly buried their weapons and went back to farming, fishing, and weaving without rendering a formal surrender. The Empire wasted no time in officially claiming the region in &lt;a href=\"1E%202837\"&gt;1E 2837&lt;/a&gt;. At long last, the &lt;a href=\"Blackwater%20War\"&gt;Blackwater War&lt;/a&gt; came to a sudden and inexplicable end.\nThe Argonians' abrupt cessation of hostilities is just another in a long series of mysteries associated with this conflict. The prevailing assumption is that their bizarre &lt;a href=\"Hist\"&gt;tree&lt;/a&gt;-worshipping tradition had something to do with it, but we may never know why they actually laid down their weapons. As a historian, it's a vexing situation, but mysteries born in the deep murk of Black Marsh are seldom solved. At least, they are seldom solved to a satisfying conclusion."}

She also believes that the remaining two pieces are in &lt;a href=\"Mournhold%20%28Tribunal%29\"&gt;Mournhold&lt;/a&gt;, although she is unsure of where exactly.

The queen will share that &lt;a href=\"King%20Hlaalu%20Helseth%20%28Tribunal%29\"&gt;King Helseth's&lt;/a&gt; Champion, may be a holder of one of the pieces, whom may have to be defeated in a duel.

However, she will not give the Shield, unless the Nerevarine can help the museum. She indicates that any craftsman in Mournhold will be able to repair the Shield. The Hero must donate two artifacts to the Museum. Behind her, at the back of the museum, the book \"&lt;a href=\"Famed%20Artifacts%20of%20Tamriel\"&gt;Famed Artifacts of Tamriel&lt;/a&gt;\" is lying on a table, which lists the artifacts they are looking for.\nThe Craftsman's Craftsman.\nAfter acquiring the Shield, and found out, by asking around Mournhold, that the most respected smith and craftsman in the city is an &lt;a href=\"Orsimer%20%28Morrowind%29\"&gt;Orc&lt;/a&gt; by the name of &lt;a href=\"Yagak%20gro-Gluk\"&gt;Yagak gro-Gluk&lt;/a&gt;, who resides within the &lt;a href=\"Craftsmen%27s%20Hall\"&gt;Craftsmen's Hall&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Godsreach\"&gt;Godsreach&lt;/a&gt;. Gro-Gluk will gladly reforge the blade, suggesting that the spike from the Shield is the final piece, and will use it to re-unite the pieces of &lt;a href=\"Trueflame%20%28Tribunal%29\"&gt;Trueflame&lt;/a&gt;. However, he states that it will be a lengthy build, taking two days to complete.\nAfter two days, Trueflame will be completed by gro-Gluk, he will, then, hand the Nerevarine the blade. Although, gro-Gluk admits that he lacks the skill to re-enchant the blade, leaving it a mere shadow of its former glory. He states that the Blade being of Dwemer origins, they probably are the only ones who knew how to enchant it, and that the Nerevarine must, therefore, find some kind of book or notes on how to bring Trueflame to its full power once again.\nAncient Assistance.\nGro-Gluk recommends that the Nerevarine investigate the ruins of &lt;a href=\"Bamz-Amschend\"&gt;Bamz-Amschend&lt;/a&gt; beneath the city once again, to see if there are any records of the Dwarves left.\nWithin Bamz-Amschend, the Nerevarine must enter &lt;a href=\"Radac%27s%20Forge\"&gt;Radac's Forge&lt;/a&gt;, where they will find the spectral ghost of Stungnthumz wandering a hall, next to a very large inanimate construct. He will state that he has the knowledge to re-enchant Trueflame, but lacks a key agent to assist him, some Pyroil Tar.\nThis Tar, according to Stungnthumz, can only be found in the caves of &lt;a href=\"Norenen-dur%23Citadel%20of%20Myn%20Dhrur\"&gt;Myn Dhrur&lt;/a&gt;, deep beneath Bamz-Amschend, within the &lt;a href=\"Daedric%20Shrines%20%28Morrowind%29\"&gt;Daedric Shrine&lt;/a&gt; named &lt;a href=\"Norenen-dur\"&gt;Norenen-dur&lt;/a&gt;.

Two can be found at the base of a waterfall, in an area of the Shrine marked as the &lt;a href=\"Norenen-dur%23The%20Wailingdelve\"&gt;Wallingdelve&lt;/a&gt;.

Once the Tar has been handed to Stungnthumz, back in his Forge, Trueflame will be &lt;a href=\"Enchant%20%28Morrowind%29\"&gt;enchanted&lt;/a&gt; anew.\nThe True Flame.\nNow that Trueflame has been restored to its former glory, the Nerevarine may return to Almalexia to complete the quest.

Time seemed to slow, and the fallen angel that stood behind her grinned knowingly. &lt;a href=\"Merid-Nunda\"&gt;Merid-Nunda&lt;/a&gt;.\nA gout of fire erupted to her right. There she laid eyes upon her sibling &lt;a href=\"Merrunz\"&gt;Merrunz&lt;/a&gt; for the first time in eternity. The blood of a god dripped from his axe, and his fanged smile belied the story of a kinslayer. He slammed his axe against the Lattice, and though nothing before this had ever done so, the Lattice shook and cracked under its weight.\nBoethra thought of dashing toward her brother then, but time was moving so slowly. Before she could move, she saw blue flames dancing on the horizon. Their sudden light made Merrunz but a shadow, and there it was that Boethra first laid eyes upon Dagon. \nBut behind him stepped a Demon King, striding through the blue flames with the severed head of a god in his hands, attached atop a rod of bone. It was &lt;a href=\"Lorkhaj\"&gt;Lorkhaj&lt;/a&gt; who had shown them the secrets of dark fire, and Boethra knew &lt;a href=\"Molagh\"&gt;Molagh&lt;/a&gt; used it now to taunt her.\nAs is her nature, she could do nothing but accept the challenge. Boethra forgot her role as the guardian of the Lattice. She saw Dagon break through. She even saw the Rainbow Angel slip in behind him. But Molagh was there, taunting and laughing, and telling her that Lorkhaj died for her.\nBoethra drew her sword, and then she made a sign with her free hand that summoned many other weapons to hover at her side. She considered her myriad movements but chose only one. To Molagh, it was as though she simply disappeared before his eyes. \nBoethra appeared above the Demon King and sent forth her ephemeral blades like rain. Then, as the sister-hawk flies, she lunged down at Molagh and pierced him with her sword. The dead-god-head ate most of the blades, but the one Boethra wielded was the only one she needed, and that had already found the flesh of her enemy.\nMolagh thrashed and roared, but so deeply embedded was the blade that he could not shake free of Boethra, even after dropping his rod of bone.\nThen Boethra summoned all her might and slammed the Demon King upon the Lattice, its moonlight fire searing burns upon his visage. As she held him there, Boethra ignored his screams and looked upon the battlefield below. The Crossing seemed small from up here.\nDagon's many new arms were ensnared by a sibling with many more. &lt;a href=\"Mafala\"&gt;Mafala&lt;/a&gt; had bound Merrunz in an inescapable web, and now she was devouring the knowledge he gained during his time in the Great Darkness.\nMerid-Nunda bore down on &lt;a href=\"Azurah\"&gt;Azurah&lt;/a&gt;, seeming to be a being of multitudes, glass shards that could form a body as quickly as they separated. The Rainbow Angel did not attack her sister as a typical foe but swirled around her as cutting light and blinding fervor. Most would have succumbed, but Azurah was a master of light herself, even those beyond the visible, and she held the Shining One at bay.\nThen Boethra saw &lt;a href=\"Noctra\"&gt;Noctra&lt;/a&gt;. And for the first time in eternity the Warrior felt worry. She had not realized it before, but the battle she had fought with Noctra had imprinted a truth in the Warrior's mind. Boethra considered the nature of &lt;a href=\"Namiira\"&gt;Namiira&lt;/a&gt;, and she wondered if Noctra would have been born without their conflict. She looked upon what could only be called a daughter, and she felt protective of a spirit she had once sought to destroy. \nAzurah then proved herself a master of dark as well, and soon the whole of Merid-Nunda was swept into a void-cage and drained of all her colors. Only in the dissolution of these fragments did Azurah realize that Merid-Nunda had separated herself into two.\nWhole upon the Crossing behind, the remaining fragments of Merid made an angelic form and laid hands upon the Aether Prism."}

It was an easy matter to convince the weak-minded Hubalajad to construct the family tomb to my specifications, making it a perfect conduit from necrotic energy. We were a single ritual away from attaining ultimate power!\nMy nephew somehow gleaned to what I was actually doing in the royal tomb and, despite his usual predilection for inactivity, he decided to take action. He locked me and my followers in the very tomb I designed and helped construct! A set-back, to be certain, but far from the disaster it could have been. Yes, it appears that the prince was able to gather a few powerful priests to seal the tomb in such a way as our necrotic energy is unable to set us free. And yes, the small amount of food and water we brought with us has long since run out. But no matter. The Bleak Veil is about to become more powerful than my nephew or his allies can even imagine!\nHowever, just in case something goes wrong, I want to make sure that the truth concerning the Bleak Veil is not lost to the passage of time. I am Magnifico Bahraha, scion of &lt;a href=\"Sentinel%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Sentinel&lt;/a&gt; and supreme necromancer of the cult of undeath known only as the Bleak Veil. I have spent years perfecting my art and collecting students and followers. We remained hidden, biding our time even as our power grew. The desolate land beyond &lt;a href=\"Abah%27s%20Landing\"&gt;Abah's Landing&lt;/a&gt; was the perfect place to gather our forces and conduct our rituals of death and darkness. This tomb, with its specially designed chambers and corridors, will focus the energy to make my cultists invincible! And of all the members of the Bleak Veil, I will be the strongest one of all!\nOf course, we must conduct the ritual before we all die of thirst or starvation. And sacrifices will need to be made. We can't very well send out for sacrificial victims while we're trapped inside the tomb. So, straws will have to be drawn to determine which of our members will die so that the rest of us can transcend into undeath. It will be glorious! And these are the last words I will write on the subject while life still beats within my body. When next we meet, I will either be dead\u2014or, the darkness willing, something even better."}

However, while you are here, he will suggest using the opportunity to cleanse some of the corruption from the forest by defeating the Corrupted Tree Spirits in the area. Indaenir can be intimidated to allow you to use the Heart's power to more easily defeat the spirits, but that will corrupt the heart and prevent a new Strangler from taking the Eldest's place. If you intimidate him, .\nHead outside. There are three tree spirits you need to kill. The closest to you is the western tree spirit, to your southwest. Beware that each of the tree spirits will summon a &lt;a href=\"Thunderbug%20Lord\"&gt;Thunderbug Lord&lt;/a&gt; to aid them in battle. Once it is dead, head southeast for the Central Tree Spirit, and then further east for the Eastern Tree Spirit. Once all three spirits are dead, head to the northeast of the area to meet up with Indaenir, and help him defeat the Servant of Naemon.\nOnce Naemon's servant is dead, you will be returned to Valenwood. Talk to Indaenir after this to finish the quest."}

While some refugees were able to escape to the south, the mayor remained behind to aid any survivors.\"\nWalkthrough.\nWhen approaching &lt;a href=\"Crestshade\"&gt;Crestshade&lt;/a&gt;, you will run into a woman called &lt;a href=\"Gurhul%20gra-Khazgur\"&gt;Gurhul gra-Khazgur&lt;/a&gt;. She will tell you that the town of Crestshade has been subjected to a blood-curse by &lt;a href=\"Reezal-Jul\"&gt;Reezal-Jul&lt;/a&gt;. Most of the civilians have evacuated, but the mayor is still trapped in the town and refuses to leave. Gurhul will ask you to head into town and rescue the mayor. \nHead up the steps to the village. Along the way, you will spot some ghosts who died in this curse and do not quite understand what is going on. Head past them and into the village itself. The mayor's house will be on the southwest side of town, past a few abandoned houses. Inside, you will find the ghost of &lt;a href=\"Mayor%20Gette\"&gt;Mayor Gette&lt;/a&gt;; talk to her and she will tell you that Reezal-Jul tore her spirit from her body and then used her body and those of others to create some kind of flesh-abomination. She will ask you to help slay the abomination, but first she needs you to help find the spirits of the other victims, as well as find her badge of office. Personal items like the badge can be used to focus energy through, so they can be used to lure the beast out.\nThe objective closest to you will be to find the spirit of &lt;a href=\"Mage%20Tharlas\"&gt;Mage Tharlas&lt;/a&gt;. She will be in the inn across the road from the mayor's house. When you speak to her, she will tell you to go find her staff that she left in the eastern tower. Head due east and across the bridge, and you will find the staff lying at the tower's entrance. While you're here, make sure to pick up the skyshard to the right of the tower. Head back to town and to the west to find &lt;a href=\"Jonne%20Surille\"&gt;Jonne Surille&lt;/a&gt;; his house will be up some flights of stairs. He will tell you to go find his skull, which is somewhere in the graveyard to the south. This is also the general direction where you can find the Mayor's pendant; it will be in the tower south of her residence. The cemetery will be south from the tower, down a slope. If your health is high enough, you can jump off this slope, though jumping from the tower will result in death. There will be several skulls throughout the area; the correct one is lying in front of a building with a statue on top. \nOnce you have all the items, head for the chapel crypts in the west of town and place the items on the altar. This will summon the spirits, and their combined efforts will summon the abomination to this room. Kill it, and the spirit of Mayor Gette will appear. Speak with her and she will thank you for killing the beast, and ask you to give these items a proper burial in the graveyard. Take the items and head for the graveyard; you will find the spirits standing around a hole just left of where you found Jonne's skull. After you bury the items here, the spirits of Tharlas and Jonne will ascend to the afterlife; speak with the Mayor to finish the quest. After this, her spirit will also disappear."}

He says Captain Janeve has established a camp for displaced refugees and he wants the Vestige to let Captain Janeve know about Reezal-Jul as he suspects Reezal-Jul had let the refugees survive to serve as a trap.\nThe Vestige journeys to Camp Tamrith. Once there, they warn Captain Janeve that Reezal-Jul is going to attack the camp. Captain Janeve believes she and her group will be ready to defend from \"the mad lizard\" and asks the Vestige to locate Jonah Marose, who had fled the camp with his mother shortly after claiming he could sense Reezal-Jul. The Vestige must travel to &lt;a href=\"Southgard%20Tower\"&gt;Southgard Tower&lt;/a&gt;, where several Montclair Immortals and Knights will attack. Jonah Marose is standing by the tower's entrance, shouting, \"Go away! Leave us alone! I don't want to become a bloodfiend!\" While Jonah runs into the tower for safety, the Vestige will be instructed to defend the tower from &lt;a href=\"House%20Montclair\"&gt;Montclair&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Montclair%20Immortal\"&gt;Immortals&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Montclair%20Knight\"&gt;Knights&lt;/a&gt;. \nOnce the threat has been dealt with, the Vestige should climb to the top of Southgard Tower to speak to Jonah Marose. Jonah will mention that Reezal-Jul is approaching with several bloodfiends and refuses to return to the camp believing that the tower is safe enough for him and his mother. The Vestige must return to the camp alone to pass on Jonah's warning. By the time the Vestige returns to Camp Tamrith, an attack has occurred. &lt;a href=\"Florenot%20Eniel\"&gt;Florenot Eniel&lt;/a&gt; will inform the Vestige that &lt;a href=\"Vampire%20%28Online%29\"&gt;vampires&lt;/a&gt; came out of nowhere, half the refugees are dead and Captain Janeve is missing. Healer Odylie is doing what she can to help. The Vestige is instructed to speak to Countess Eselde Tamrith.\nUpon speaking to Countess Tamrith, the Vestige will learn both Captain Janeve and Darien Gautier are absent. Countess Tamrith suggests the Vestige to ask some of the guards for answers as to their whereabouts, as well as pass on some poultice from her. Remic is the only guard who saw Captain Janeve and believes she charged west toward the river, intent on pursuing Reezal-Jul out of contempt toward necromancers. At said location, the Vestige discovers Darien Gautier on the ground and injured among a couple of bodies. Darien is less concerned about himself and more worried about the Captain. He explains that he had followed Captain Janeve during her pursuit of Reezal-Jul and that a group of vampires surrounded them, and while Darien fought the vampires off, Captain Janeve was dragged off into a nearby cave. Darien tells the Vestige to hurry in after her.\nThe Vestige must enter Shadowfate Cavern. Deep inside, the Vestige will discover Jonah Marose who claims that the \"Bad One\" is going to do terrible things to the Captain. Since the cave is full of vampires, Jonah advises the Vestige to use a secret tunnel. Deeper into the cavern, the Vestige must kill several Montclair vampires, including Reezal-Jul. Afterwards, they must search for the Captain who will be standing next to Countess Tamrith. Countess Tamrith explains that the Captain is turning into a vampire and, out of mercy, believes her sister must be killed and avoid turning into a monster.\nThe Vestige is asked to speak to Captain Janeve to offer comfort while the Countess prays over her decision. In contrast to the Countess' suggestion, Captain Janeve wishes to continue living and claims she can control herself, as she knows other vampires have done. It is up to the Vestige to decide what to do about Captain Janeve. If the Vestige chooses to agree with Captain Janeve and spare her, they may leave the cavern and return to where Darien is waiting. The Vestige may also speak to Countess Tamrith, who prays the Vestige's mercy does not turn out to be a terrible mistake."}

She believes they're searching Skyreach Hold for more of the nirncrux element, which they refer to as \"the blood of Nirn.\"\"\nWalkthrough.\nWhen approaching Skyreach Hold, you will find an Altmer named Nendirume. Talk to her and she will tell you that the &lt;a href=\"Scaled%20Court\"&gt;Scaled Court&lt;/a&gt; have taken over the ancient city in hopes of finding Nirncrux there. She will ask you to help stop them. \nHead across the bridge into Skyreach Hold and proceed through the crridors. In the room with the water, you will have to face off against a boss called &lt;a href=\"Nathrasa%20Shimmerscale\"&gt;Nathrasa Shimmerscale&lt;/a&gt;, who is ver strong and likes to split herself into five Shimmers throughout the fight. Take care when fighting her, or she shimmers could easily overwhelm you. After you kill her, proceed on to the next room and fight the Mantikora there. It is generally a good idea to first focus on the weaker Scaled Court enemies before trying to take down the boss itself. \nProceed on, but take care not to enterthe easternmost chamber, as you will find a powerful boss there that you do not have to face. Instead, head south through the door to the Skyreach Pass. You will be facing several waves of enemies on the bridge here, including no less than three Mantikoras. Take care not to get overwhelmed by the sheer amount of foes, and proceed across the bridge once you have slain them all. Proceed through the ruins on the other side, fighting many more Scaled Court members and Mantikoras along the way. In the room with the water on the side, you will face off against two bosses named &lt;a href=\"Navren%20Daral\"&gt;Navren Daral&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Akkra%20gra-Korma\"&gt;Akkra gra-Korma&lt;/a&gt;; they are quite strong as a pair, so it is a good idea to first focus on killing one and then the other, rather than ocusing on both at the same time. Navren will come charging atyou while Akkra will sling spells from a distance, so it is easier to focus on Navren first. Once both of them lie dead, proceed westward into the caves. \nIn the big room here, you will be fighting a horde of trolls alongside &lt;a href=\"Taskmaster%20Zagrakh\"&gt;Taskmaster Zagrakh&lt;/a&gt;; these are strong, but the real boss will appear after you have killed them. This is a troll called &lt;a href=\"Rakmath%20the%20Breaker\"&gt;Rakmath the Breaker&lt;/a&gt;. Rakmath is powerful, so take care. After defeating him, proceed through the tunnels into the Skyreach Pass. This time, you are passing through the area below the bridge, and you will be facing a boss named &lt;a href=\"Azdarmu%20the%20Awakened\"&gt;Azdarmu the Awakened&lt;/a&gt; alongside a legion of Hoarvors. Azdarmu is not the strongest boss you have faced here; try to attack him from the back and he should not be too difficult. After slaying the beast, head along the stream and down the waterfalls to get back into Skyreach Hold. You will be facing the Scaled Court again, alongside their mantikoras. \nYou will eventually reach a room with piles of Nirncrux strewn about; this is where you will be facing the final boss. His name is Exarch Arnoth, and he has been infused with the power of Nirncrux to make him stronger. At the start of the fight, he will throw fireballs at you; make sure to dodge those. He will also summon balls of fire toward himself; these will heal him if they reach him. After a while, he will forgo the fire and instead try to punch you; try to keep your distance and take him down. Once Arnoth lies dead, proceed ahead through the Outer Halls to the north and leave Skyreach Hold. \nSeek out Nendirume in Dragonstar to finish the quest. She will be in the northwest of town."}

Garan Marethi informs the Dragonborn of the &lt;a href=\"Bloodstone%20Chalice\"&gt;Bloodstone Chalice&lt;/a&gt;, an ancient &lt;a href=\"Vampire%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;vampire&lt;/a&gt; artifact that needs to be filled with water from the Redwater Spring located deep within &lt;a href=\"Redwater%20Den\"&gt;Redwater Den&lt;/a&gt; to make the Volkihar Vampires more powerful. He also tells the Dragonborn that once the Chalice is filled, blood from a powerful vampire must be added to it. He warns that the den has fallen into the hands of unsavory people who will also need to be dealt with.\nWalkthrough.\nHead to Redwater Den located within the &lt;a href=\"The%20Rift%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Rift&lt;/a&gt;. From the outside, it will appear as a dilapidated hut guarded only by two &lt;a href=\"Redwater%20Lookout\"&gt;Redwater Lookout&lt;/a&gt;s, who will welcome the Dragonborn. Go around to the side of the hut and into a trap door that leads inside the den. A &lt;a href=\"Doorman\"&gt;Doorman&lt;/a&gt; will be posted inside who warns the Dragonborn to keep all weapons sheathed and not to cause any trouble. Once inside, it becomes apparent that a secret &lt;a href=\"Skooma%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;skooma&lt;/a&gt; den is being run from within. Speaking with the &lt;a href=\"Dealer\"&gt;Dealer&lt;/a&gt; at the counter will give a little more insight into the den, and if the Dragonborn's &lt;a href=\"Speech\"&gt;Speech&lt;/a&gt; skill is high enough, some free &lt;a href=\"Redwater%20Skooma\"&gt;Redwater Skooma&lt;/a&gt; samples can be obtained from her. Head past the cacophony of hacking coughs and towards the Adept level locked gate on the right. &lt;a href=\"Lockpicking%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Pick&lt;/a&gt; the lock or &lt;a href=\"pickpocket\"&gt;pickpocket&lt;/a&gt; the key from the &lt;a href=\"Attendant\"&gt;Attendant&lt;/a&gt;, and head into the cave system.\nSkooma cave.\nOnce inside, head through the tunnels and into a large cavern that seems to be where the Redwater Skooma is distilled. Fight past the hostile vampires and their Death Hounds and thralls. Once they are defeated, on the bottom level, there is a prison cell, with a dead NPC inside it, which can be opened with the Redwater Den Backrooms Key. Alternatively, it can be opened by picking the adept level lock. Next head up the ramp and around to the upper platform where a lever is located. Pull the lever and it will drop the wooden drawbridge. Cross the bridge and head deeper into the cave system, killing any additional hostiles until the door to Redwater Spring is reached.\nRedwater Spring.\nThis part of the cave is actually an old Nordic tomb that was buried during an earthquake in the &lt;a href=\"Second%20Era\"&gt;Second Era&lt;/a&gt;, and as such is infested with &lt;a href=\"Draugr%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Draugr&lt;/a&gt;. Once the cell is entered, directly north will be a table with gold and \"&lt;a href=\"Venarus%20Vulpin%27s%20Journal\"&gt;Venarus Vulpin's Journal&lt;/a&gt;\" on it. After grabbing them, proceed through the tunnels and towards the main prison. Be careful, when entering, to avoid a floor trap that leads to a spike pit. Kill the vampires here and head forward. &lt;a href=\"Venarus%20Vulpin\"&gt;Venarus Vulpin&lt;/a&gt;, a powerful vampire and leader of the skooma operation can be found in the next set of rooms. Kill him and his thralls. Once they have been defeated, on the nearby table, there will be gold and gems as well as \"&lt;a href=\"Venarus%20Vulpin%27s%20Research\"&gt;Venarus Vulpin's Research&lt;/a&gt;\". Then head on until the spring itself is reached.\nWalk up to the bubbling bloody waters and attempt to fill the chalice. At that moment &lt;a href=\"Stalf\"&gt;Stalf&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Salonia%20Caelia\"&gt;Salonia Caelia&lt;/a&gt;, two vampires from Lord Volkihar's court, will appear. They argue about who should get the credit for returning the chalice and then they decide to attack the Dragonborn (be aware attacking them without allowing them to argue will make the Dragonborn a traitor in Harkon's court).\nOnce they have both been killed, fill the Chalice with bloody spring water. Walk up to one of their bodies and take a sample of their blood. Proceed through the tunnel and exit the cave system back into the skooma den. Return to Garan Marethi and tell him what happened.\nAn alternate method is to consume the Redwater Skooma while in the den. After its effects, the Dragonborn will wake up locked up inside a cell within the dungeon, overhearing a conversation between the Dealer and a vampire before the Dealer returns to the den, leaving the vampire to guard the Dragonborn. In this same cell, there is a &lt;a href=\"Spell%20Tomes%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Spell Tome&lt;/a&gt; - &lt;a href=\"Telekinesis%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Telekinesis&lt;/a&gt;. From here, the gate can be unlocked and the spring reached as normal."}

It is given to the &lt;a href=\"Last%20Dragonborn\"&gt;Dragonborn&lt;/a&gt; by &lt;a href=\"Dinya%20Balu\"&gt;Dinya Balu&lt;/a&gt;, one of the priestesses, when asking for the &lt;a href=\"Abilities%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Blessing of Mara&lt;/a&gt;. To earn &lt;a href=\"Mara\"&gt;Mara&lt;/a&gt;'s favor, Dinya sends the Dragonborn to the village of &lt;a href=\"Ivarstead%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Ivarstead&lt;/a&gt; to help a local farmer with a love problem.\n&lt;a href=\"Riften%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Riften&lt;/a&gt;.\nThis quest is located by entering the city of Riften and following the path on the left towards &lt;a href=\"Mistveil%20Keep\"&gt;Mistveil Keep&lt;/a&gt;. The Temple of Mara will be marked by a pair of &lt;a href=\"Hold%20Guard\"&gt;guards&lt;/a&gt; standing before an opening in the stone wall with twin banners hanging behind them. Enter the Temple and speak with Dinya Balu, the Head Priestess of the Temple, and request Mara's Blessing. She will say that one must prove themselves worthy of the blessing by advancing the cause of love throughout &lt;a href=\"Skyrim\"&gt;Skyrim&lt;/a&gt;, and relays a vision sent to her by the Goddess to visit a small village called Ivarstead to the west of Riften. Travel west to Ivarstead in order to continue the quest.\n&lt;a href=\"Ivarstead%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Ivarstead&lt;/a&gt;.\nUpon arriving at the hamlet of Ivarstead, the Dragonborn will be prompted to speak with &lt;a href=\"Fastred\"&gt;Fastred&lt;/a&gt;, who is in a conundrum with her parents. Fastred fancies herself in love with a local man named &lt;a href=\"Bassianus%20Axius\"&gt;Bassianus Axius&lt;/a&gt;, but her parents disapprove of their choice to leave Ivarstead for Riften. After speaking with Fastred, speak with her mother and father as well.\nSpeaking with her mother, &lt;a href=\"Boti\"&gt;Boti&lt;/a&gt;, will reveal that she does not disapprove of Bassianus, and would allow the pair to elope while she took care of informing her husband. Speaking with Fastred's father, &lt;a href=\"Jofthor\"&gt;Jofthor&lt;/a&gt;, will show that he thinks his daughter is a rather fickle young woman, whose affections change frequently. He will state that, up until very recently, Fastred was infatuated with another local man by the name of &lt;a href=\"Klimmek\"&gt;Klimmek&lt;/a&gt;, and that he is concerned that Fastred will leave the rapidly shrinking village for good if she chooses to leave with Bassianus.\nThere are two choices: Travel to the local inn to inform Bassianus that Fastred's mother is willing to run interference so that he and his love interest can elope to Riften, or investigate Klimmek's past relationship with Fastred. Confronting Klimmek will result in the fisherman realizing that he must be assertive with his feelings for Fastred, and let her know that he wants to be with her. Additionally, if this path is taken, Bassianus will move to Riften alone. Speaking with Bassianus will result in Fastred and Bassianus eloping to Riften. Choosing either will result in the quest advancing.\nAfterwards, return to Riften to learn that the Goddess requires a journey far to the west, to the city of Markarth to stoke the flames of love in the heart of Calcelmo, the eccentric &lt;a href=\"Dwemer\"&gt;Dwemer&lt;/a&gt; researcher and court magician in &lt;a href=\"Understone%20Keep%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Understone Keep&lt;/a&gt;.\n&lt;a href=\"Markarth%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Markarth&lt;/a&gt;.\n&lt;a href=\"Calcelmo\"&gt;Calcelmo&lt;/a&gt; is experiencing a difficult situation. He is attracted to a woman named &lt;a href=\"Faleen\"&gt;Faleen&lt;/a&gt;, who is the &lt;a href=\"housecarl\"&gt;housecarl&lt;/a&gt; to &lt;a href=\"Jarl\"&gt;Jarl&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Igmund\"&gt;Igmund&lt;/a&gt; in the keep, but has no idea how to speak with her. Fearing the possibility of offending her in some way by bringing up the wrong subject, Calcelmo asks the Dragonborn to get advice from a friend of Faleen's named &lt;a href=\"Yngvar%20the%20Singer\"&gt;Yngvar&lt;/a&gt;, who is reputed to be quite successful with wooing the local ladies.\nYngvar can be found in the &lt;a href=\"Treasury%20House\"&gt;Treasury House&lt;/a&gt; at night or in the &lt;a href=\"Silver-Blood%20Inn\"&gt;Silver-Blood Inn&lt;/a&gt; by day. He can also often be found resting against a rock by the stream, just opposite the &lt;a href=\"Abandoned%20House%20%28Markarth%29\"&gt;Abandoned House&lt;/a&gt;. If the &lt;a href=\"Stormcloaks\"&gt;Stormcloaks&lt;/a&gt; have taken the city, he will be the new Jarl's housecarl. If Markarth was negotiated for the Stormcloaks during &lt;a href=\"Season%20Unending\"&gt;Season Unending&lt;/a&gt; and retaken by the &lt;a href=\"Imperial%20Legion%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Legion&lt;/a&gt;, he will be at the &lt;a href=\"Palace%20of%20the%20Kings\"&gt;Palace of the Kings&lt;/a&gt;. He will reveal that Faleen puts on a tough front, but has a weakness for poetry. It just so happens that Yngvar has &lt;a href=\"Love%20Poem\"&gt;a poem&lt;/a&gt; that he can tweak to be about Faleen, for a sum of 200 &lt;a href=\"Septim%20%28Coin%29\"&gt;septims&lt;/a&gt;. After paying the gold sum, take the poem back to Understone Keep.\nAfter prompting Faleen to read \"Calcelmo's\" poem, she will ask that a &lt;a href=\"Faleen%27s%20Letter%20to%20Calcelmo\"&gt;letter&lt;/a&gt; be delivered to him. Head back to Calcelmo,\u00a0and proceed to follow him and witness his stumbling confession. If Faleen is in Solitude, it will take several in-game hours for Calcelmo to walk all the way from Markarth to Solitude, so it is recommended to proceed with other quests until a notification shows up in the quest journal that Calcelmo has spoken with Faleen, or wait for four hours and he will be there. With the job in Markarth complete, return to the Temple of Mara for the next objective.\nFor the final task, Mara requests that two lovers, who have lost one another beyond the pale of death, be reunited.\n&lt;a href=\"Gjukar%27s%20Monument\"&gt;Gjukar's Monument&lt;/a&gt;.\nPut on the amulet given and travel south-southeast of Rorikstead to find the spirit of &lt;a href=\"Ruki\"&gt;Ruki&lt;/a&gt;, looking for the body of her husband, &lt;a href=\"Fenrig\"&gt;Fenrig&lt;/a&gt;, among the ruins. Speak with her and she will ask for help looking for her husband's body. With no corpses present in the area, head northeast towards an open plain. The spirit of Ruki's husband is south of &lt;a href=\"Greenspring%20Hollow\"&gt;Greenspring Hollow&lt;/a&gt;, across the river.\nSpeak with him and he will ask to be led back to Ruki. At this point, either choose to fast travel back to Gjukar's Monument, or take the scenic route. After reaching Ruki, the two dead lovers will speak briefly, and ascend towards the heavens as they pledge eternal love for one another, seemingly unaware that they are both deceased.\nReturn to Riften and speak with Dinya Balu to receive the &lt;a href=\"Agent%20of%20Mara\"&gt;Agent of Mara&lt;/a&gt; blessing (Permanent +15% &lt;a href=\"Resist%20Magic%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Resist Magic&lt;/a&gt;) and complete the quest. The Dragonborn may now hand out pamphlets for her called \"&lt;a href=\"The%20Warmth%20of%20Mara\"&gt;The Warmth of Mara&lt;/a&gt;\" as well."}

{"id": "48899", "revid": "17401442", "url": "https://elderscrolls.fandom.com/wiki?curid=48899", "title": "The Book of the Dragonborn", "text": "The Book of the Dragonborn is a &lt;a href=\"Books%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;book&lt;/a&gt; in .\nContents.\nMany people have heard the term \"&lt;a href=\"Dragonborn%20%28Lore%29\"&gt;Dragonborn&lt;/a&gt;\" - we are of course ruled by the \"&lt;a href=\"Septim%20Dynasty\"&gt;Dragonborn Emperors&lt;/a&gt;\" - but the true meaning of the term is not commonly understood. For those of us in the &lt;a href=\"Order%20of%20Talos\"&gt;Order of Talos&lt;/a&gt;, this is a subject near and dear to our hearts, and in this book I will attempt to illuminate the history and significance of those known as Dragonborn down through the ages.\nMost scholars agree that the term was first used in connection with the Covenant of &lt;a href=\"Akatosh\"&gt;Akatosh&lt;/a&gt;, when the blessed St. &lt;a href=\"Alessia\"&gt;Alessia&lt;/a&gt; was given the &lt;a href=\"Amulet%20of%20Kings\"&gt;Amulet of Kings&lt;/a&gt; and the Dragonfires in the &lt;a href=\"Temple%20of%20the%20One\"&gt;Temple of the One&lt;/a&gt; were first lit. \"Akatosh, looking with pity upon the plight of men, drew precious blood from his own heart, and blessed St. Alessia with this blood of Dragons, and made a Covenant that so long as Alessia's generations were true to the dragon blood, Akatosh would endeavor to seal tight the &lt;a href=\"Oblivion%20Gate\"&gt;Gates of&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Oblivion%20%28Realm%29\"&gt;Oblivion&lt;/a&gt;, and to deny the armies of &lt;a href=\"daedra\"&gt;daedra&lt;/a&gt; and undead to their enemies, the Daedra-loving &lt;a href=\"Ayleid\"&gt;Ayleid&lt;/a&gt;s.\" Those blessed by Akatosh with \"the dragon blood\" became known more simply as Dragonborn.\nThe connection with the rulers of the Empire was thus there from the beginning - only those of the dragon blood were able to wear the Amulet of Kings and light the Dragonfires. All the legitimate rulers of the Empire have been Dragonborn - the Emperors and Empresses of the &lt;a href=\"Alessian%20Empire\"&gt;first Cyrodilic Empire&lt;/a&gt; founded by Alessia; &lt;a href=\"Reman%20Cyrodiil\"&gt;Reman Cyrodiil&lt;/a&gt; and his heirs; and of course &lt;a href=\"Tiber%20Septim\"&gt;Tiber Septim&lt;/a&gt; and his heirs, down to our current Emperor, His Majesty &lt;a href=\"Pelagius%20Septim%20IV\"&gt;Pelagius Septim IV&lt;/a&gt;.\nBecause of this connection with the Emperors, however, the other significance of the Dragonborn has been obscured and largely forgotten by all but scholars and those of us dedicated to the service of the blessed Talos, Who Was Tiber Septim. Very few realize that being Dragonborn is not a simple matter of heredity - being the blessing of Akatosh Himself, it is beyond our understanding exactly how and why it is bestowed. Those who become Emperor and light the Dragonfires are surely Dragonborn - the proof is in the wearing of the Amulet and the lighting of the Fires. But were they Dragonborn and thus able to do these things - or was the doing the sign of the blessing of Akatosh descending upon them? All that we can say is that it is both, and neither - a divine mystery.\nThe line of Septims have all been Dragonborn, of course, which is one reason the simplistic notion of it being hereditary has become so commonplace. But we know for certain that the early Cyrodilic rulers were not all related. There is also no evidence that Reman Cyrodiil was descended from Alessia, although there are many legends that would make it so, most of them dating from the time of Reman and likely attempts to legitimize his rule. We know that the &lt;a href=\"Blades\"&gt;Blades&lt;/a&gt;, usually thought of as the Emperor's bodyguards, originated in Akaviri crusaders who invaded Tamriel for obscure reasons in the late First Era. They appear to have been searching for a Dragonborn - the events at &lt;a href=\"Pale%20Pass\"&gt;Pale Pass&lt;/a&gt; bear this out - and the Akaviri were the first to proclaim Reman Cyrodiil as Dragonborn. In fact it was the Akaviri who did the most to promote his standing as Emperor (although Reman himself never took that title in his lifetime). And of course there is no known hereditary connection between Tiber Septim and any of the previous Dragonborn rulers of Tamriel.\nWhether there can be more than one Dragonborn at any time is another mystery. The Emperors have done their best to dismiss this notion, but of course the Imperial succession itself means that at the very least there are two or more potential Dragonborn at any time: the current ruler and his or her heirs. The history of the Blades also hints at this - although little is known of their activities during the Interregnum between Reman's Empire and the rise of Tiber Septim, many believe that the Blades continued to search out and guard those they believed were (or might be) Dragonborn during this time.\nLastly, we come to the question of the true meaning of being Dragonborn. The connection with dragons is so obvious that it has almost been forgotten - in these days when dragons are a distant memory, we forget that in the early days being Dragonborn meant having \"the dragon blood\". Some scholars believe that was meant quite literally, although the exact significance is not known. The Nords tell tales of Dragonborn heroes who were great dragonslayers, able to steal the power of the dragons they killed. Indeed, it is well known that the &lt;a href=\"Akaviri\"&gt;Akaviri&lt;/a&gt; sought out and killed many dragons during their invasion, and there is some evidence that this continued after they became Reman Cyrodiil's Dragonguard (again, the connection to dragons) - the direct predecessor to the Blades of today.\nI leave you with what is known as \"The &lt;a href=\"Prophecy%20of%20the%20Dragonborn\"&gt;Prophecy of the Dragonborn&lt;/a&gt;\". It often said to originate in an Elder Scroll, although it is sometimes also attributed to the ancient Akaviri. Many have attempted to decipher it, and many have also believed that its omens had been fulfilled and that the advent of the \"Last Dragonborn\" was at hand. I make no claims as an interpreter of prophecy, but it does suggest that the true significance of Akatosh's gift to mortalkind has yet to be fully understood.\nWhen &lt;a href=\"Imperial%20Simulacrum\"&gt;misrule&lt;/a&gt; takes its place at the &lt;a href=\"Staff%20of%20Chaos\"&gt;eight corners of the world&lt;/a&gt;\nWhen the &lt;a href=\"Numidium\"&gt;Brass Tower&lt;/a&gt; walks and &lt;a href=\"Warp%20in%20the%20West\"&gt;Time is reshaped&lt;/a&gt;\nWhen the &lt;a href=\"Tribunal\"&gt;thrice-blessed&lt;/a&gt; fail and the &lt;a href=\"Red%20Mountain\"&gt;Red Tower&lt;/a&gt; trembles\nWhen the &lt;a href=\"Martin%20Septim\"&gt;Dragonborn Ruler&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Oblivion%20Crisis\"&gt;loses his throne&lt;/a&gt;, and the &lt;a href=\"White-Gold%20Tower\"&gt;White Tower&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Great%20War\"&gt;falls&lt;/a&gt;\nWhen the &lt;a href=\"Throat%20of%20the%20World%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Snow Tower&lt;/a&gt; lies &lt;a href=\"Skyrim%20Civil%20War\"&gt;sundered, kingless, bleeding&lt;/a&gt;\nThe &lt;a href=\"Alduin%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;World-Eater&lt;/a&gt; wakes, and the &lt;a href=\"Aurbis\"&gt;Wheel&lt;/a&gt; turns upon the &lt;a href=\"Last%20Dragonborn\"&gt;Last Dragonborn&lt;/a&gt;."}

When the rains and wind come, it will be the roots that you hold firm. Under the roots lies &lt;a href=\"Nirn\"&gt;Nirn&lt;/a&gt;, and over her boughs shines &lt;a href=\"Aetherius\"&gt;Aetherius&lt;/a&gt;. She provides both floor and roof. You need no other shelter.\n&lt;a href=\"Azra%20Root\"&gt;Azra Root&lt;/a&gt; grows along the banks of the slow-moving rivers. Pull it gently free of the mud and wrap the roots in a damp cloth. Thus the plant may be transported. These will take root in pots and baskets of moss, if they are kept moist enough.\nWhen the &lt;a href=\"Salache%20Elves\"&gt;Salache Elves&lt;/a&gt; first came to Elden Root, they were led to it by &lt;a href=\"Meridia\"&gt;Meridia&lt;/a&gt;'s shining colors, which told them this was her gifts and blessing. The Tree's branches and roots are as hands, reaching at once into the &lt;a href=\"Mundus\"&gt;Mundus&lt;/a&gt; and Overworld. On this, we built Mundus' greatest city and prove ourselves her highest and most honored race.\nIn the heat of the summer, shroud the leaves of the &lt;a href=\"Alocasia\"&gt;Alocasia&lt;/a&gt; in silk. The fruit will grow larger and sweeter if the growing process is thus slowed. It is said &lt;a href=\"Y%27ffre\"&gt;Y'ffre&lt;/a&gt; took its fallen fruit as tribute.\nThe Alomeria plant is related to this, but will not bear fruit. You may know it as &lt;a href=\"Water%20Hyacinth%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Water Hyacinth&lt;/a&gt;.\nWhen they arrived, they said, \"This is the Grove of the One Great Tree. This is the Grove of the Sages, the &lt;a href=\"Elden%20Grove\"&gt;Elden Grove&lt;/a&gt;. We brought with us life and knowledge, and in the shade of the Great Tree, we build the classrooms and libraries, so that we would make a harvest of our legacy of intellect.\"\nThe seed of the &lt;a href=\"Nirnroot%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Nirnroot&lt;/a&gt; may be carried great distances by birds and other creatures. Near the Great Tree, the fronds grow tall and lush. Farther away, they may grow reedier and less hardy.\nLet this likewise be a lesson."}

He handed me this blank book and told me to fill it. I'm not much of one for writing, but I'll honor his request as best I can. I'm here in &lt;a href=\"Senchal%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Senchal&lt;/a&gt; now. Following the trail of a lost soul. &lt;a href=\"Gian%20Mico\"&gt;Gian Mico&lt;/a&gt;. He's wanted for several crimes, not least of which is stealing some important books from the &lt;a href=\"Mages%20Guild%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Mages Guild&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Daggerfall%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Daggerfall&lt;/a&gt;. Books? Of all the things to steal! He last showed up here. My guess is that he thought being among the &lt;a href=\"Khajiit%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Khajiit&lt;/a&gt; would keep him safe enough, especially since there is an &lt;a href=\"Imperials%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Imperial&lt;/a&gt; presence here that he can blend into.\nBut I'll find him.\nDay Two: Senchal\nI walked around the city. You can't take a step without bumping into a refugee or a flustered Khajiit. A militia of sorts marginally protects the city. They call them the &lt;a href=\"Shields%20of%20Senchal\"&gt;Shields of Senchal&lt;/a&gt;. It was originally the &lt;a href=\"Thirteenth%20Legion\"&gt;Thirteenth Legion&lt;/a&gt;, but the locals gave them their new name after they settled in and started to police the place. They don't run the city, though. Just enforce whatever rules the Khajiit want them to enforce, from the sound of things.\nMy bet is that Mico has joined them. Perhaps I should do the same just long enough to find my target.\nDay Three: The Shields\nOh by all the gods, these &lt;a href=\"Alfiq\"&gt;Alfiq&lt;/a&gt;! I don't know how it got into my room, but it woke me up with purring, as if it were a &lt;a href=\"Cat%20%28Online%29\"&gt;housecat&lt;/a&gt;, then said clear as day, \"Time to get up, walker.\" I'm not sure what to do. If this were another Imperial, I'd smash their nose in then kick them out of my room. But it's a creature that reminds me a bit of Mouser, my first cat. I just nodded at it, then asked it to leave, polite as can be.\nAfter breakfast, I talked to some fellow named &lt;a href=\"Bruccius\"&gt;Bruccius&lt;/a&gt; about the Shields and how they recruit new candidates. Though he seemed like he wanted to complain about his aches or send me after some wayward priest, I kept him on topic and asked what the new recruits did. He helpfully pointed me to an area of the city where they train. I think I'll head over there and see if I can pick out Mico.\nDay Four: Bureaucracy\nI spent most of today talking to various Shields. Mico was indeed among the new recruits. I went to the person in charge of the training squad and told her about Mico's past activities and my bounty to bring him back to the Mages Guild in Daggerfall. She said she needed to bump this up the chain of command. It wasn't long before I ended up talking to the Shield's commander, &lt;a href=\"General%20Renmus\"&gt;General Renmus&lt;/a&gt;.\nI learned more about the Shields of Senchal in this discussion. They were sent here five years ago by &lt;a href=\"Varen%20Aquilarios%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Emperor Aquilarios&lt;/a&gt; to help the city restore order in the aftermath of &lt;a href=\"Knahaten%20Flu\"&gt;the flu&lt;/a&gt;. Without royal guidance since the demise of the ruling family of Senchal, the Imperials helped set up a city council and have been working with them to govern the region. With the arrival of the &lt;a href=\"Dragons%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Dragons&lt;/a&gt;, though, refugees are pouring into the city, putting a strain on already stretched resources. He invited me to join the Shields. I guess smart, well-trained combatants are in short supply.\nI was honored, of course, but I prefer traveling and working on my own for now.\nAnd that is when the general noted that Mico is a very skilled &lt;a href=\"battlemage\"&gt;battlemage&lt;/a&gt; and had stolen those books in the hope of coming here and destroying Dragons with new magic. He didn't condone the mage's actions, but he also needed as many soldiers as he could get to protect Senchal. So, he refused to release Mico into my hands.\nMy first bounty, and I need to make a decision regarding whether to let this bounty go for the greater good or try to persuade the general to let me take him back to Daggerfall to face justice. I've already talked to Mico, and he does indeed wish to fight Dragons with some techniques he uncovered in various tomes he took from the Mages Guild. But theft? Why didn't he work with all those mages to fight Dragons? It's not as if these beasts are going to stick around &lt;a href=\"Elsweyr%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Elsweyr&lt;/a&gt; forever. They're a threat to us all.\nAnd, having written that, I think I've made my decision. Father, you were right to give me this journal. Sometimes writing things down removes any foggy thinking. Perhaps my next bounty will be easier. I'll acquire a new book for my next bounty. (Oh, I should note: I'm going to work with those mages who had their books stolen to put them in touch with Mico so they can work together to defeat the Dragons.)"}

This quest is started by visiting the &lt;a href=\"Statue%20to%20Meridia\"&gt;Statue to Meridia&lt;/a&gt;, or, after reaching level 12, by finding the radiant quest item &lt;a href=\"Meridia%27s%20Beacon\"&gt;Meridia's Beacon&lt;/a&gt; in random chests.\nBackground.\n\"An otherworldly voice coming from Mount Kilkreath is commanding me to find a beacon and return it.\"\nWalkthrough.\nUpon obtaining the beacon, which is a large gem with no value, &lt;a href=\"Meridia\"&gt;Meridia&lt;/a&gt; commands the &lt;a href=\"Last%20Dragonborn\"&gt;Dragonborn&lt;/a&gt; to take the beacon to the &lt;a href=\"Meridia%27s%20Shrine\"&gt;shrine&lt;/a&gt; located west of &lt;a href=\"Solitude%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Solitude&lt;/a&gt;, directly north of the &lt;a href=\"Haafingar%20Stormcloak%20Camp\"&gt;Haafingar Stormcloak Camp&lt;/a&gt;. Once there, Meridia will tell the Dragonborn that there is a powerful necromancer named &lt;a href=\"Malkoran\"&gt;Malkoran&lt;/a&gt; defiling her temple, whom the Dragonborn must destroy.\nThis quest is started in one of two ways:\n\"A new supplicant approaches. Listen. Hear me and obey. A foul darkness has seeped into my temple. A darkness that you will destroy. But first, you must restore to me my Beacon. I shall guide you unto it. Find it and return here. And great shall be your reward.\"\n\"A new hand touches the Beacon. Listen. Hear me and obey. A foul darkness has seeped into my temple. A darkness that you will destroy. Return my Beacon to Mount Kilkreath. And I will make you the instrument of my cleansing light.\"\nOnce the beacon is obtained, Meridia will speak to the Dragonborn every day as she becomes increasingly alarmed at their lack of interest in helping the Solar Daughter. This can be avoided by simply going to the shrine, as the beacon will randomly appear. Note that this effect is removed\u00a0by update 1.6 or later.\nIf the Statue is approached and the beacon is found later:\n\"You have found my beacon. But it is not time for rejoicing. The defiler continues to profane my temple. Return to my figure on Mount Kilkreath, and I shall make you the instrument of my cleansing light.\"\nMeridia's Beacon.\n\"Look at my temple, lying in ruins. So much for the constancy of mortals, their crafts and their hearts. If they love me not, how can my love reach them? Restore to me my beacon, that I might guide you toward your destiny.\"\nUpon approaching the shrine with the beacon, a voice is heard commanding that the beacon be placed at the feet of Meridia.\n\"It is time for my splendor to return to Skyrim. But the token of my truth lies buried in the ruins of my once great temple, now tainted by a profane darkness skittering within. The Necromancer Malkoran defiles my shrine with vile corruptions, trapping lost souls left in the wake of this war to do his bidding. Worse still, he uses the power stored within my own token to fuel his foul deeds. I have brought you here, mortal, to be my champion. You will enter my temple, retrieve my artifact, and destroy the defiler. Guide my light through the temple to open the inner sanctum and destroy the defiler.\"\nThe Dragonborn is then whisked into the clouds where a glowing orb of Meridia's light appears. She describes a necromancer named Malkoran planning to raise the dead of Skyrim to wage war on the living, using the energy of a powerful artifact in her shadow-filled shrine. The Dragonborn is to enter her shrine and direct a beam of light throughout the dungeon.\nShining Light on the Dark Temple.\nUpon entering, there is a desecrated corpse of either a Stormcloak or Imperial Legionnaire on the first flight of stairs. Throughout the entire interior there are an abundance of them, each one with a handsome amount of coin, which makes this quest very profitable (between 3000 and 5000 is available). In addition, there are a large number of traps, and two locked doors that, once picked, reveal levers that open nearby gates with treasure on the other side.\nThere are a total of three pedestals to be activated in the temple to direct Meridia's light. The first large room has the first pedestal. Further down is a second room with several Corrupted Shades\u00a0and\u00a0the second pedestal. Once activated, the beam of light drains both &lt;a href=\"Health%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;health&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Magicka%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;magicka&lt;/a&gt; if the Dragonborn steps into its path. At the top of the steps, the beam of light can be seen shining through some debris that cannot be breached; the path continues down the steps and through the hallway to the south.\u00a0The hallway contains several more corrupted shades, then several doors and, eventually, a chest with random loot.\u00a0\nThe room with the third pedestal has\u00a0several more shades (one immediately by the entrance). There is\u00a0a lever locked room on the north side of the area, along with an &lt;a href=\"Arcane%20Enchanter%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Arcane Enchanter&lt;/a&gt;. After activating the pedestal, the door at the top of the wooden ramp against the south side will be open, which leads outside to the Kilkreath Balcony. The balcony contains an expert-locked chest with leveled loot. Up the stairs is a door that leads to the &lt;a href=\"Kilkreath%20Ruins\"&gt;Kilkreath Ruins&lt;/a&gt;.\nUp some stairs is a fairly large room with more Shades, plus three more pedestals. Activating the pedestal at the top of the wooden ramp opens a door on that same level to the east. Through the short hallway, there will be four burial urns to the left, a chest, a hallway to the north, and a wooden door against the north wall. The door is trapped, but the trap can be disarmed. Behind the door is a small room with some loot.\nBefore entering the next hallway, there is a tripwire around the corner to the left that sets off some swinging axes. There is a lever on the floor in the corner which turns off the axes. Through the caged walkway is a platform from which the Dragonborn can jump over the gap to another pedestal on the left. After jumping back over, a ramp leads to good treasure in the northwest corner. A door on the west wall that was just unlocked allows the area to be left.\nNext there will be a dimly lit room with a second level on either side. The ramp up to the left (against the west wall) leads to a regular pedestal with a potion that, if taken, triggers a spike trap. The other side will lead the Dragonborn through another short hall to the very top of the main room and to the third pedestal to activate. Once complete, the door to the south on the first floor will open, which leads to a door to the &lt;a href=\"Kilkreath%20Catacombs\"&gt;Kilkreath Catacombs&lt;/a&gt;.\nA hallway leads to a room with the final pedestal. Activating it opens a set of double doors against the east wall. There is one chest here to the right of those doors. Through the doors and down more stairs, Malkoran\u00a0can be seen\u00a0performing some sort of ritual. (Going through the Dungeon can be avoided by walking right of the Statue and going through the entrance to the second part of the Dungeon, to Malkoran's ritual.)\nDestroy Malkoran.\nMalkoran is accompanied by eight or more corrupted shades. A quick way to get the upper hand is by using a\u00a0bow, &lt;a href=\"Beast%20Form%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Beast Form&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"Vampire%20Lord\"&gt;Vampire Lord&lt;/a&gt; form to kill Malkoran off first, and to then move back up the steps sniping the shades.\nThe shades' strategy is to get behind the Dragonborn before attacking, but a &lt;a href=\"Followers%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;follower&lt;/a&gt; or, with a high enough Conjuration skill, one or two summons can be helpful, especially an essential character. If the Dragonborn stands in the doorway to the chamber, the ally will stand behind them making it impossible for the shades to get around. They will only attack if the Dragonborn moves too far forward, so using magic or a ranged weapon to hit them at point blank range will avoid this. Malkoran is reluctant to move from in front of the altar so he can be worn down\u00a0from the doorway with a bow.\nThere is a strong poison of Paralysis on the floor in the altar room, off to the right when facing the altar. Using this poison is a good way of gaining an advantage on Malkoran, who is a very tough opponent.\nIf has been completed, the &lt;a href=\"Bend%20Will\"&gt;Bend Will&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"shout\"&gt;shout&lt;/a&gt; can be targeted directly at Malkoran as the Dragonborn walks into the chamber. He will turn against the shades and quickly dispatch them. Once the shades are gone, it is possible to sneak behind him and land many critical hits so as to avoid dealing with his powerful &lt;a href=\"Frost%20Damage%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;frost spells&lt;/a&gt;. If he is killed fast enough, Malkoran's Shade will emerge but still be under the effect of Bend Will, so it can be hit without fear of retaliation.\nTopping off the Dragonborn's health/stamina/magicka before the Dragonborn delivers the killing blow to Malkoran will make it easier to survive him, as his shade will rapidly appear and continue throwing frost bolts. It is possible that the shade will use powerful flame or shock spells instead of frost spells.\n\"It is done. The defiler is defeated. Take Dawnbreaker from its pedestal.\"\nWhen Malkoran and his corrupted followers are finally dead, Meridia tells the Dragonborn to retrieve Dawnbreaker from the pedestal before them.\n\"Malkoran is vanquished. Skyrim's dead shall remain at rest. This is as it should be. This is because of you. A new day is dawning. And you shall be its herald. Take the mighty Dawnbreaker and with it purge corruption from the dark corners of the world. Wield it in my name, that my influence may grow.\"\nNote that there will not be another chance to come back to this room after retrieving Dawnbreaker, and simply taking it will transport the Dragonborn from the room, so be sure to collect all the items one wishes to obtain. There are a large number of desecrated corpses, each having 20\u2013125 , so there is great profit to be made if they are looted before taking the sword.\nDawnbreaker.\nOnce the Dragonborn takes Dawnbreaker, they will be whisked back to the heavens for one last conversation and a great view."}

Jorunn was in &lt;a href=\"Riften%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Riften&lt;/a&gt; with his closest companions, the &lt;a href=\"Pack%20of%20Bards\"&gt;Pack of Bards&lt;/a&gt;. Fildgor, meanwhile, was on the northeast coat of &lt;a href=\"Skyrim%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Skyrim&lt;/a&gt;, fighting alongside his sister when the &lt;a href=\"Akaviri\"&gt;Akaviri&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"Dir-Kamal\"&gt;Dir-Kamal&lt;/a&gt; launched their assault. As the Akaviri made their way toward &lt;a href=\"Windhelm%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Windhelm&lt;/a&gt;, Jorunn and his companions forged their own path toward the fabled Nord city.\nFildgor, meanwhile, demonstrated his fighting prowess, as well as his exalted anger, over and over again as the battle for the coast raged on. He often led his own team of companions, the &lt;a href=\"Stormfist%20Brigade\"&gt;Stormfist Brigade&lt;/a&gt;, which consisted of members of the &lt;a href=\"Stormfist%20Clan\"&gt;Stormfist clan&lt;/a&gt;. They had fought beside Fildgor during his pilgrimage and coming-of-age trials, and were devoted to the Strong-Prince.\nJorunn and Fildgor, along with their closest comrades, each arrived in time to see the gates of Windhelm break wide. The brothers fought valiantly, but they couldn't prevent the fall of the city or the death of Queens &lt;a href=\"Mabjaarn\"&gt;Mabjaarn&lt;/a&gt; and Nurnhilde (\"The Brief Queen\"), who died defending the palace and the people they loved. The twins, who hadn't been close for several years, nonetheless fell into familiar companionship and joined forces to repel the invaders. Thanks to Jorunn's alliance with the Dark Elves and the unexpected but welcome assistance of the Argonians, the Akaviri invasion was at last crushed.\nAs Jorunn and his forces returned to Windhelm, Fildgor stepped forward to claim rulership. The crisis was over, and he decided to push his claim. He expected Jorunn to acquiesce, as his brother usually did in the face of Fildgor's anger and unrestrained passion. But Jorunn refused. The Skald Prince decided to become the Skald King, for he had seen what Fildgor's passions were capable of. In war, he wanted Fildgor at his side. But as a leader for his people? Jorunn didn't really want to sit upon the throne, but he felt he had no choice. He didn't believe Fildgor would be a good ruler for his people.\nEnraged by Jorunn's defiance, Fildgor rallied the Stormfist clan and other supporters he had throughout the realm. After all, he was a true Nord warrior, not a singer and scholar like his brother. Jorunn saw that the kingdom was headed for civil war, so he challenged Fildgor to single combat. The Strong Prince smiled, confident he could defeat his bard of a brother easily. He accepted, and the longest three hours in recent history began. The brothers' war was on.\nThe two brothers fought in the square outside the battle-damaged palace. The fight was brutal and long. Weapons clashed, parried, came together, moved apart, and drew blood. When it appeared that neither brother was going to gain the upper hand before they both collapsed from sheer exhaustion, Jorunn called upon reserves no one expected him to possess. He struck Fildgor's weapon, shattering it. Then he knocked Fildgor flat and demanded his surrender.\nWith no other option available, Fildgor surrendered. But his hatred burned and his rage surrounded him like a roiling storm. With a broken heart, Jorunn exiled his brother and chastened the Stormfist clan for supporting him. Fildgor cursed Jorunn's name and departed. While the Skald King went on to prove himself a capable and beloved ruler, the Strong Prince was rumored to have fled to the lands of the &lt;a href=\"Daggerfall%20Covenant\"&gt;Daggerfall Covenant&lt;/a&gt;. Perhaps one day, the brothers' war will resume."}

The Morag Tong were worshipers of the &lt;a href=\"Daedra\"&gt;Daedra&lt;/a&gt; spirit &lt;a href=\"Mephala\"&gt;Mephala&lt;/a&gt;, who encouraged them to commit ritual murders. In their early years, they were as disorganized as only obscure cultists could be due to there being no one to lead the group, and as a group they dared not murder anybody of any importance. This changed with the rise of the &lt;a href=\"Night%20Mother\"&gt;Night Mother&lt;/a&gt;.\nAll leaders of the Morag Tong, and then afterward the Dark Brotherhood, have been called the Night Mother. Whether the same woman (if it is even a woman) has commanded the Dark Brotherhood since the Second Era is unknown. What is believed is that the original Night Mother developed an important doctrine of the Morag Tong, the belief that, while Mephala does grow stronger with every murder committed in her name, certain murders were better than others. Murders that came from hate pleased Mephala more than murders committed because of greed. Murders of great men and women pleased Mephala more than murders of relative unknowns.\nWe can approximate the time this belief was adopted with the first known murder committed by the Morag Tong. In the year &lt;a href=\"2E%20324\"&gt;324&lt;/a&gt; of the Second Era, the &lt;a href=\"Potentate\"&gt;Potentate&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Versidue-Shaie\"&gt;Versidue-Shaie&lt;/a&gt; was murdered in his palace in what is today the &lt;a href=\"Elsweyr\"&gt;Elsweyr&lt;/a&gt; kingdom of &lt;a href=\"Senchal\"&gt;Senchal&lt;/a&gt;.

In remarkable synchronicity at a time when Tamriel the Arena was a fractured land, the Morag Tong was outlawed throughout the continent. Every sovereign gave the cult's elimination his highest priority. Nothing more was officially heard of them for a hundred years.\nIt is more difficult to date the Era when the Morag Tong re-emerged as the Dark Brotherhood, especially as other guilds of assassins have sporadically appeared throughout the history of &lt;a href=\"Tamriel\"&gt;Tamriel&lt;/a&gt;. The first mention of the Dark Brotherhood that I have found is from the journals of the &lt;a href=\"Blood%20Queen%20Arlimahera\"&gt;Blood Queen Arlimahera&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"Hegathe\"&gt;Hegathe&lt;/a&gt;.

Rulers and wealthy merchants used the order as an assassin's guild. The Brotherhood gained the obvious rewards of a profitable enterprise, as well as the secondary benefit that rulers could no longer actively persecute them: They were needed. They were purveyors of an essential commodity. Even an extremely virtuous leader would be unwise to mistreat the Brotherhood.\nNot long after Alimahera's journal entry came perhaps the most famous series of executions in the history of the Dark Brotherhood. The Colovian Emperor-Potentate &lt;a href=\"Savirien-Chorak\"&gt;Savirien-Chorak&lt;/a&gt; and every one of his heirs were murdered on one bloody night in &lt;a href=\"Sun%27s%20Dawn\"&gt;Sun's Dawn&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"2E%20430\"&gt;430&lt;/a&gt;.

For over four hundred years, until the advent of the Warrior Emperor &lt;a href=\"Tiber%20Septim\"&gt;Tiber Septim&lt;/a&gt;, chaos reigned over Tamriel. Though no comparably impressive executions have been recorded, the Brotherhood must have grown fat with &lt;a href=\"Septim%20%28Coin%29\"&gt;gold&lt;/a&gt; during that &lt;a href=\"interregnum\"&gt;interregnum&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe Dark Brotherhood has no shortage of business opportunities-an \"accounting,\" I have been informed, is the Brotherhood's favorite euphemism for an execution.

They point to &lt;a href=\"Red%20Mountain\"&gt;Red Mountain&lt;/a&gt; and other triumphant, if hard-fought, battles against the &lt;a href=\"Dwemer\"&gt;Dwemer&lt;/a&gt; as proof. But once long ago, our people were as far as a mountainside in &lt;a href=\"Skyrim%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Skyrim&lt;/a&gt;. In that distant time, we were drive to the edge of defeat.\nIn the time before the Red Mountain, we were known as the &lt;a href=\"Chimer\"&gt;Chimer&lt;/a&gt;. We were just another race of mer eking out a living on the edge of the &lt;a href=\"Inner%20Sea\"&gt;Inner Sea&lt;/a&gt;.\nThen came the &lt;a href=\"Nede%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Nedes&lt;/a&gt;. Though the &lt;a href=\"Nords%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Nords&lt;/a&gt; of today are allies, the Nedes were adversaries of the darkest nature. They sought only land, conquest and spoils. We extended open hands of diplomacy, which they lopped off. Any Elf in the horde's path was fair game ---- man, woman or child.\nThe greatest generals of the age were brothers. &lt;a href=\"Balreth\"&gt;Balreth&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Sadal\"&gt;Sadal&lt;/a&gt; led armies of willing warriors against the horde. At first, this was an attempt to drive them from the ash. As the war went on, their actions turned purely to defense and redirection. If a force of Chimer could spend their blood allowing a village to evacuate, then that was blood well spent.\nThe Nedes, after a few short years, controlled most of what we call now &lt;a href=\"Stonefalls%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Stonefalls&lt;/a&gt;. The Chimer armies were cut off from the Inner Sea and reinforcements from &lt;a href=\"Vvardenfell%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Vvardenfell&lt;/a&gt;. The brothers retreated again and again until finally, they were left with a small elite force of sorcerers and troops. This force then took shelter in an ancient &lt;a href=\"Daedric%20Ruins%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Daedric ruin&lt;/a&gt;.\nWhat happened at that ruin has been lost to time, but the massive statues that now mark endure as mute testament. The death of the Chimer generals ended the war. But at what cost?\nAt this ruin, the so-called &lt;a href=\"Brothers%20of%20Strife\"&gt;Brothers of Strife&lt;/a&gt; were born. My research shows that Chimer mages from Vvardenfell eventually bound the beasts, but not before the Brothers ended the lives of hundreds of men and mer. One of the darkest chapters in our people's history followed. The unstoppable beasts made ash run red with blood, Chimer and Nede alike.\nWe can only speculate what brought the Brothers to &lt;a href=\"Nirn\"&gt;Nirn&lt;/a&gt;. Perhaps a &lt;a href=\"Daedric%20Prince\"&gt;Daedric Prince&lt;/a&gt; summoned them to that ruin. Maybe it was &lt;a href=\"Sheogorath\"&gt;Sheogorath&lt;/a&gt; having a laugh or a grim survival test from &lt;a href=\"Boethiah\"&gt;Boethiah&lt;/a&gt;.\nWhen the two beats were finally bound into the &lt;a href=\"Ash%20Mountain\"&gt;twin&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Tormented%20Spire\"&gt;spires&lt;/a&gt; of Stonefalls, they went to their rest with the blood of history staining their claws. We must hope and pray to the Three that their like will never be seen in the Ashlands again."}

He thinks we'll make a killing getting these lumber shipments down there, and if we can do it faster than anyone else, all the better. He told me the Wood Elves won't cut down any of their own trees because of some deal they have with them. Deal with trees, ha! Crazy Elves. As long as they have the gold, I'll bring the goods. None of us have ever been down that way, but I bet it'll be a nice change of pace from the old &lt;a href=\"Elsweyr%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Elsweyr&lt;/a&gt; routes I've been running. Tired of all the sun, anyway.\n18th Second Seed\nI hope they have really, really nice beds in &lt;a href=\"Elden%20Root%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Elden Root&lt;/a&gt;. And less bugs. I've never seen so many in my life\u2014beetles the side of my hand, snaky things with more legs that I want to think about, and the biting! I can't sleep for the itching, and I swear they settle all over you as soon as you sit still. We haven't passed any kind of village, and I'm starting to doubt this is a trail at all with all the slashing we're having to do to make passage for the wagons. It's all overgrown, like no one's used it forever.\n24th Second Seed\nLast night, I dreamed I was in the &lt;a href=\"Roosting%20Quail\"&gt;Roosting Quail&lt;/a&gt; back home. My favorite tavern. Best ale I've ever had. Maxintius and I were sitting in the common room, and he told a joke so funny that I spat out ale and couldn't stop laughing. Then I was awake, but the laughter wasn't gone, hooting, high-pitched laughter coming from the trees. The guard on watch, that &lt;a href=\"Argonians%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Argonian&lt;/a&gt; whose name I can't pronounce, he didn't see anything. We scouted around, but the laughter stopped, and then we all just sat by the fire feeling uneasy. I grabbed my flask of &lt;a href=\"Flin%20%28Morrowind%29\"&gt;Flin&lt;/a&gt; and raised it to my mouth, only to feel wiggling legs! In my mouth! Everyone else's flasks and skins were full of 'em too. &lt;a href=\"Akatosh\"&gt;Akatosh&lt;/a&gt;'s fiery roar!\n2nd &lt;a href=\"Mid%20Year\"&gt;Mid Year&lt;/a&gt;\nThings are just getting weirder. Today, we were slashing our way forward double-time, because we all want to get this done with and get out, and Maxintius spotted giant beetles up ahead on the trail. Not just big bugs\u2014huge bugs. Bugs the size of wolves. Massive pinchers, shiny shells. They weren't doing much, just crawling around, but we hadn't seen their like so far and approached slowly. When I got within a short stone's throw, I noticed something strange about their legs. They looked like a man's! They were! In a flash they stoop up and rushed towards us, running and flipping and laughing, covered in beetle shells and grabbing things from the camp before disappearing off into the trees. We tried to give chase. The Argonian fired a quick arrow, but it bounced right off that carapace armor. Were those Wood Elves? I heard there were really wild ones, but dressing up as giant bugs? They aren't bandits, they hardly even took much and didn't hurt anyone.\n4th Mid Year\nThat's it. We're turning back. There's no way we're making it to Elden Root. and I'm getting a pretty clear message that they\u2014whoever they are\u2014don't want us to. No amount of gold is worth this, I'd rather haggle with a &lt;a href=\"Khajiit%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Khajiit&lt;/a&gt; for a week than deal with this place. This time, our water was drugged. That had to be what happened. Who knows how they got to it or what they put in it, but when we woke up in the middle of the night, skeletons were dancing around the campfire. I couldn't move, could only watch in a haze and listen to the strange music, the ratting and hissing and ow, warped flutes. Were they wearing bones? It's all fuzzy except one thing: we are getting out of here, profits be damned!"}

I'm stuck in my room at the guild hall with a broken ankle, and the healer says it'll be a miracle if I'm walking again this side of six weeks. The hall steward says it's good to take the time to put word to parchment, so the younger members can get the benefits of my \"wisdom.\" Drinking seems like a better way to waste the hours, but it's the hall steward who's putting me up for my convalescence.\nSo read well. Any ponce with a dirk can gut a few &lt;a href=\"Sabre%20Cat%20%28Online%29\"&gt;sabre cats&lt;/a&gt; in the foothills of &lt;a href=\"Kilkreath%20Temple%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Kilkreath&lt;/a&gt;. But the real work, that's in the pits and dark corners of &lt;a href=\"Western%20Skyrim\"&gt;Western Skyrim&lt;/a&gt;. I've knocked about them enough to know what's what, so if you want a chance of seeing daylight after delving in these places, keep reading.\n&lt;a href=\"Shadowgreen\"&gt;SHADOWGREEN&lt;/a&gt;\nAny recruit might think a place so close to &lt;a href=\"Solitude%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Solitude&lt;/a&gt; won't be that dangerous. Wrong. There's a gods-damned menagerie of &lt;a href=\"Creatures%20%28Online%29\"&gt;beasts&lt;/a&gt; in this place, ready to claw out your eyes and eat your liver. And that's just the start\u2014rivers of fire ribbon the place! Saw a healer get the air choked from her lungs just by standing too close to the stuff. And while you're minding the heat, you need to contend with the frozen wind that blows in from the &lt;a href=\"Sea%20of%20Ghosts\"&gt;Sea of Ghosts&lt;/a&gt;. It can turn your fingers black if you don't wrap them tightly. Try fending off a hungry &lt;a href=\"Bear%20%28Online%29\"&gt;bear&lt;/a&gt; with a handful of frostbitten fingers, I dare you!\nThere's worse rumors lately. &lt;a href=\"Hagraven%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Hagravens&lt;/a&gt;, the prickly wretches, were spotted setting up roosts in the place. Calling all sorts of nastier things to their side, I reckon. Gods know what they want.\n&lt;a href=\"Dragonhome\"&gt;DRAGONHOME&lt;/a&gt;\nFirst, let me clear the air. There's not a single damn &lt;a href=\"Dragons%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Dragon&lt;/a&gt; in the place. I'm sick of every Svyne, Bor and Oda thinking they're going to slay a Dragon and become a hero of legend. You want to do that, travel to &lt;a href=\"Elsweyr%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Elsweyr&lt;/a&gt;!\nWhat this place does have is &lt;a href=\"Draugr%20%28Online%29\"&gt;draugr&lt;/a&gt;\u2014enough to give any chapter of the guild pause. The &lt;a href=\"Dragon%20Cult\"&gt;Dragon Cult&lt;/a&gt; really knew how to fit a legion into a few musty halls, I'll give them that. And where you don't find draugr, you'll find cultists barmy enough to think it's smart to worship Dragons. Think they're back in the days of old, they do! It's got the other charms of barrows, too\u2014traps, sepulchers that suddenly burst open, and on top of that, a fall that will kill you if you don't watch your footing. So, mind the heights!\n&lt;a href=\"Frozen%20Coast\"&gt;FROZEN COAST&lt;/a&gt;\nDrowning is a terrible way to die. There's a lot of ways a berk can die in our line of work, but drowning is just about the worst of them in my book. So, imagine you're standing on a shelf of slick ice, fighting off a &lt;a href=\"Sea%20Giant\"&gt;Sea Giant&lt;/a&gt;, and you take a misstep and plunge into water colder than &lt;a href=\"Naemira\"&gt;Naemira&lt;/a&gt;'s teat. You ain't jumping right out of that. The cold saps the air from your lungs straight away. Whatever strength you had to pull your armored arse out of the deep flutters away. And then you sink.\nThat's the bad part. The worse part is the clan of Sea Giants that decided these rocks might be a good spot to sit for a spell and sow some mayhem. You might think I'm talking about the doddering, fur-clad sods you see in in the wilds. No. Sea Giants are smart. They're also mean, and they'll happily take the time to make your death as painful as possible\u2014just for the fun of it. And they don't make cheese from mammoth milk\u2014at least as far as I can tell.\n&lt;a href=\"Chillwind%20Depths%20%28Online%29\"&gt;CHILLWIND DEPTHS&lt;/a&gt;\nIt's a cave. Low light, low ceiling. Until recently, there wasn't much in there to be worried about. Some &lt;a href=\"Reachfolk\"&gt;Reachfolk&lt;/a&gt; hiding out, maybe. Or a stray &lt;a href=\"Necromancer%20%28Online%29\"&gt;necromancer&lt;/a&gt; or two. Nothing the guild couldn't handle. But some creatures have set up homes in these tunnels, creatures I haven't seen before. Like &lt;a href=\"Goblin%20%28Online%29\"&gt;goblins&lt;/a&gt;, only not.\nPale things with nasty armor, strong enough to pull a full-grown &lt;a href=\"Orsimer%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Orc&lt;/a&gt; screaming into the black tunnels. I took a job to check it out, and barely got two chambers in before these things attacked me.\nThere's some kind of bugs they use\u2014massive, armored things, with mandibles like steel traps. They'll bite right through chain mail, and I wouldn't be surprised if venom dripped from those jaws.\n&lt;a href=\"Labyrinthian%20%28Online%29\"&gt;LABYRINTHIAN&lt;/a&gt;\nAny smart berk can make their way into and out of the delves above without too much fear of losing hide nor hair. But only an idiot goes into Labyrinthian without a small army. I don't care if a scholar's only got the coin to pay for one guard, it ain't worth the gold. There's big blokes in the upper levels of the place, and plenty of meaner things in the caverns below. Word of warning: don't go too deep. Plenty go down that don't come back up."}

The results were the &lt;a href=\"Arms%20of%20Chaos\"&gt;Arms of Chaos&lt;/a&gt;, magical staves that harnessed the power of the Sun and the Moon. Yet one day, the mage dismantled the staves and left them lifeless, convinced they were possessed by some unknown madness. \nIt was my master's obsession to restore these artifacts, and in her honor, it has become mine. If only I could speak to her, I would know what to do next.\n17th of Rain's Hand, 4E 201\nLeave it to my late master to provide guidance on how to proceed. Going through her effects, I found a sketch of the necklace she often wore. It's identical in all ways but one - there's an orb set in the center of the amulet, teeming with fire. If it's true that Loreth's magic allowed one to travel to distant worlds, then it's possible this orb is a &lt;a href=\"Sigil%20Stone%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Sigil Stone&lt;/a&gt;! If my hunch is right, the staves are missing the same. \n22nd of Rain's Hand, 4E 201\nMy spirit renewed, I scoured the archives in &lt;a href=\"Winterhold%20%28Skyrim%20City%29\"&gt;Winterhold&lt;/a&gt; and found my path forward. I must find a way to summon three &lt;a href=\"Daedra\"&gt;Daedra&lt;/a&gt;, Guardians of the Sigil Stones. There's an altar on the eastern shore of &lt;a href=\"Skytemple%20Ruins\"&gt;Skytemple Ruins&lt;/a&gt;, bearing a Daedric mark. It may be what I need.\n28th of Rain's Hand, 4E 201\nI've hit a snag. The ring used to activate the summoning circle was buried with my late master, which I foolishly had shipped to her ancestral home. To think she even gifted me the ring, and I mistook it for sentiment! I feel thicker than &lt;a href=\"Netch%20Jelly\"&gt;Netch Jelly&lt;/a&gt;.\nStill, complaining won't undo my mistake. The name of the ship was the Sea Stallion, I wonder if I can catch it before it departs.\n2nd of Last Seed, 4E 201\nThe courier has yet to return. I'm beginning to fear the worst; that the ship had already left the dock long before my letter arrived. I'm not sure what to do at this point. I haven't had much sleep, and my mind is starting to hear creaking noises where nothing exists. \nI wish my master were here still, so I could seek her wisdom. They say there is a &lt;a href=\"Wayward%20Pass\"&gt;Shrine of Arkay&lt;/a&gt; at the pass to the south. Come morning, I will visit it and pray for an answer."}

And yet not always: for once, to my shame, I was compelled to serve another.\nI was on guard duty at the &lt;a href=\"Endless%20Stair\"&gt;Endless Stair&lt;/a&gt;, an assignment I always enjoy, for I can mock and torment the passing Soul Shriven without being held responsible for them meeting their quotas. Leaping out from behind a claw-pillar while shouting, \"There you are, weakling!\" just never loses its appeal.\nI was lurking behind a &lt;a href=\"Dark%20Anchor\"&gt;Dark Anchor&lt;/a&gt; chain link, preparing to terrify an approaching &lt;a href=\"Soul%20Shriven\"&gt;Soul Shriven&lt;/a&gt; by suddenly knocking her down and sneering, \"No match at all,\" when I suddenly felt a strange tingling all over, from my horns down to my toes. I grew dizzy as the plane spun around me, nearly fell into a pool of blue plasm, and then suddenly felt myself hurled into an endless black void.\nI wasn't alarmed at first, because who hasn't been hurled into an endless black void? It wasn't until I began to materialize at my destination and got a taste of the air that I had my first misgivings. \"I smell \u2026 weakness,\" I said to myself\u2014and I couldn't have been more right.\nIt was then that I first heard the voice of my Conjurer as he said, \"Ah, this one looks fairly robust,\" and the full horror of my situation broke upon me. For I had been summoned to do the bidding \u2026 of a mortal.\nI turned, aghast, to see who had dared summon me across the infinities to &lt;a href=\"Nirn\"&gt;Nirn&lt;/a&gt;, and found myself faced with a tall Elf of &lt;a href=\"Summerset%20Isles%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Summerset&lt;/a&gt;. Oh, I recognized the type: I'd abused more than a few &lt;a href=\"Altmer%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Altmeri&lt;/a&gt; Soul Shriven in my time, and with gusto, for they evince a haughty arrogance entirely inappropriate in mere mortals. This one gave me a brief, appraising look, and then turned away, saying, \"Follow and fight. There are &lt;a href=\"Order%20of%20the%20Black%20Worm%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Worm Cultists&lt;/a&gt; that need slaying.\"\nWorm Cultists. Can you imagine the ignominy, fellow kyn? Not only had I been conjured away from my duty by one of the hated Elven mortals, but I must serve him by slaying the minions of &lt;a href=\"Mannimarco%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Mannimarco&lt;/a&gt;, our Dread Lord's lieutenant and viceroy-to-be! I tried to resist, flexing my indomitable will, but the mortal mage's binding spell was too strong\u2014all I could do was say, \"No one escapes!\" and follow him past a pair of torches into a subterranean maze of tunnels.\n\"You serve the great &lt;a href=\"Vanus%20Galerion%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Vanus Galerion&lt;/a&gt;, Dremora,\" my Conjurer announced, quite unnecessarily\u2014for what need had I to know the name of my slavemaster? But then I reconsidered, and mentally added his name to that long list each of us keeps: the list labeled, \"Vengeance.\"\nI followed, not deigning to crouch when my Conjurer hunched over to sneak, merely glaring at him and thinking, \"I will feast upon your heart.\" In truth, however, it was as well that I had this Elf Vanus to follow, for the tunnels were many and twisting, and though we Dremora are fearless, relentless, and unparalleled among warriors throughout Oblivion, our sense of direction is rather poor. When doing courier duty, I've been known to lose my way right in the middle of the &lt;a href=\"Moonless%20Walk\"&gt;Moonless Walk&lt;/a&gt; and wind up back at the &lt;a href=\"Lightless%20Oubliette\"&gt;Lightless Oubliette&lt;/a&gt; where I started.\nIn time this Vanus began to pause frequently, listening, which only increased my irritation and impatience. Finally he stopped, with a \"Shh!\" to me\u2014which was completely unfair, as I hadn't said a word. But I realized why he'd stopped when I suddenly heard human speech from the tunnel ahead. Hesitating nary an instant, I drew my greatsword and rushed forward, crying \"A challenger is near!\" The Elf cursed and followed, but he had only himself to blame\u2014I was following his orders exactly.\nThe next minute passed in the red fury that all true Dremora feel when they enter battle. But my usual enjoyment of bloody slaughter was tainted by the knowledge that I was killing those my Dread Lord would prefer I didn't, and frankly, that just ruined the whole experience for me. As I lopped off the limbs and heads of the Worm Cultists, I was aware of the energies of the Elf's powerful magics crackling past me, incinerating the more distant enemies, but I was too mortified to enjoy the orgy of destruction. The Elf came striding up as I subdivided the final Worm Anchorite, gloating, \"So much for them. Take that, Mannimarco!\"\n\"There could be no other end,\" I replied sourly, then felt the strange tingling again as the conjuration that had brought me to Nirn began to weaken. As the bonds dissolved I took one menacing step toward the Elf, but then the plane spun around me again, and it was back into the endless black void.\nWhen I came to my senses I was lying in a pool of turquoise slime, looking up at the smiling face of my superior, &lt;a href=\"Dremora%20Kynreeve%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Kynereeve&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Xalxorkig\"&gt;Xalxorkig&lt;/a&gt;. \"So, Zzedenkathik,\" he snarled, \"straying from your post when on duty, eh? It's the scathe-rings for you, my lad!\"\n\"But, Kynreeve,\" I cried, leaping to attention, \"I couldn't help it! I was conjured, summoned to Nirn\u2014by a mortal!\"\nXalxorkig smiled even wider. \"And that'll be an extra shift scathing for telling such a hornless lie. Now march, Zzedenkathik,\" he shouted, thumping me with his truncheon. \"Left, right, left, right, left, right \u2026.\"\nI hate it when Xalxorkig\u00a0smiles. Kynreeve or not, his name's going on my list."}

Iachesis was said to be an extremely powerful wizard in his own right, having led the Order for over three millennia.\nBiography.\nIachesis is known to have been the head of the Psijic Order as early as &lt;a href=\"1E%2020\"&gt;1E 20&lt;/a&gt;, when the mage &lt;a href=\"Voernet\"&gt;Voernet&lt;/a&gt; went to the Isle of Artaeum to meet with him. Around that period, the Psijics served as counselors to kings and proponents of \"The Elder Way,\" a \"philosophy of meditation and study said to bind the forces of nature to the individual will.\" In &lt;a href=\"1E%202920\"&gt;1E 2920&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Sotha%20Sil\"&gt;Sotha Sil&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Almalexia\"&gt;Almalexia&lt;/a&gt; were recorded as having met with him after the signing of the &lt;a href=\"Coldharbour%20Compact\"&gt;Coldharbour Compact&lt;/a&gt;.\nIn the early Second Era, a former student of the Order named Heliand brought an 11-year-old boy named &lt;a href=\"Vanus%20Galerion\"&gt;Trechtus&lt;/a&gt; to Iachesis. He recognized the young boy's potential and welcomed him into the Order, bestowing upon him the new name \"Vanus Galerion\" and taking him on as a pupil. In &lt;a href=\"2E%20230\"&gt;2E 230&lt;/a&gt;, Iachesis met with a now older and more accomplished Galerion, along with King &lt;a href=\"Rilis%20XII\"&gt;Rilis XII&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"Firsthold\"&gt;Firsthold&lt;/a&gt;, to propose the formation of a new guild called the &lt;a href=\"Mages%20Guild\"&gt;Mages Guild&lt;/a&gt;.\nShortly afterwards, the Isle of Artaeum mysteriously vanished from Nirn, with Iachesis and the rest of the Psijic Order disappearing with it. Iachesis was known to still be the leader of the Order in &lt;a href=\"2E%20582\"&gt;2E 582&lt;/a&gt;, receiving reports and missives from a fellow member named &lt;a href=\"Lilatha\"&gt;Lilatha&lt;/a&gt; who traveled outside the Isle. When Artaeum returned to the world after 500 years in &lt;a href=\"2E%20730\"&gt;2E 730&lt;/a&gt;, the Order was no longer led by Iachesis. The Psijics would not, or could not, offer an explanation as to where the Isle had gone or what had happened to Iachesis."}

His father was an &lt;a href=\"Imperial\"&gt;Imperial&lt;/a&gt; and his mother was an &lt;a href=\"Ayleid\"&gt;Ayleid&lt;/a&gt;, though Ianus had mostly elven traits. As such, his parents never allowed him to go outside &lt;a href=\"Fort%20Faleria\"&gt;Fort Faleria&lt;/a&gt; as the &lt;a href=\"Alessian%20Empire\"&gt;Alessian Empire&lt;/a&gt; would banish or execute him due to the &lt;a href=\"First%20Pogrom\"&gt;First Pogrom&lt;/a&gt;.\nAfter becoming an adult, Ianus became discontent with being isolated in his father's underground estate, and managed to find a way to easily get in and out of the fort. He fell in love with a merchant's daughter, and fathered a son with her named &lt;a href=\"Maxivian%20Faleria\"&gt;Maxivian Faleria&lt;/a&gt;. The woman's parents were horrified at Maxivian's &lt;a href=\"Mer\"&gt;elvish&lt;/a&gt; traits, and forced her to confess that Ianus was the child's father. In order to keep his family a secret from the Empire, Nunex Faleria hid his grandson with Ianus in the fort.\nWithin days, the Alessian Army was at the gate of Fort Faleria, seeking to arrest Nunex for his crimes of treason after discovering his elvish children. On the 19th &lt;a href=\"Sun%27s%20Dawn\"&gt;Sun's Dawn&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"1E%20421\"&gt;1E 421&lt;/a&gt;, Ianus went with his family to speak to their father, just after he had finished performing a dangerous ritual to wipe out the Alessian Army. Ianus put his hand on his father's shoulder, but it was too late for Lord Faleria to cancel the ritual, and the darkness he summoned inadvertently killed Ianus and Maxivian. Lord Faleria buried him with his sister &lt;a href=\"Lucina%20Faleria\"&gt;Lucina&lt;/a&gt; on the surface, where he never allowed his children to go, writing \"Boundless Eternity Awaits Us\" on his &lt;a href=\"Epitaph%20for%20Ianus%20Faleria\"&gt;epitaph&lt;/a&gt;."}

She also mentions a passage stating that \"the silver pierced brow of the Traitors shall ward his sleep.\" This descriptions matches the eight skulls found beside the honored corpse in the tomb, all of which have a &lt;a href=\"Ancient%20Silver%20Dagger\"&gt;Ancient Silver Dagger&lt;/a&gt; stuck in their foreheads.

He attempted to test out his spell on the rooftops of an unknown settlement, but was humiliated for his beliefs. He later relocated to an island southeast of Fort Dragonclaw, and set up base at a platform.\nHis second last attempt from flying resulted in injuries of unknown severity, though after recovering, he set out to properly fly again. Icarian calibrated his spell by channeling more magicka, and cast it on himself, hoping to land in water when it wore off, but instead landed on another island in the lake, with the impact killing him.\nLegacy.\nIcarian's dreams of flying were shared by others, albeit centuries apart. In &lt;a href=\"3E%20427\"&gt;3E 427&lt;/a&gt;, a Bosmer mage named &lt;a href=\"Tarhiel\"&gt;Tarhiel&lt;/a&gt; used the &lt;a href=\"Scroll%20of%20Icarian%20Flight\"&gt;Scroll of Icarian Flight&lt;/a&gt;, named after Icarian, in an attempt to fly. He altered the spell in some ways, though also ended up dying from the impact outside &lt;a href=\"Seyda%20Neen%20%28Morrowind%29\"&gt;Seyda Neen&lt;/a&gt;. In &lt;a href=\"4E%20201\"&gt;4E 201&lt;/a&gt;, an unnamed &lt;a href=\"Wizard%20%28Dragonborn%29\"&gt;Bosmer wizard&lt;/a&gt; replicated Icarian's spell after reading a &lt;a href=\"Black%20Book\"&gt;Black Book&lt;/a&gt;.

If possible, I'm to recover the Ice Blade of the Monarch, and bring that to back to the Oracle.\"\u2013 Journal entry\nWalkthrough.\nDetailed.\nImperial Chapels.\nOracle &lt;a href=\"Lalatia%20Varian\"&gt;Lalatia Varian&lt;/a&gt; at the &lt;a href=\"Imperial%20Chapels\"&gt;Imperial Chapels&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Ebonheart%20%28Morrowind%29\"&gt;Ebonheart&lt;/a&gt; reveals that she had a vision concerning the whereabouts of the &lt;a href=\"Ice%20Blade%20of%20the%20Monarch%20%28Weapon%29\"&gt;Ice Blade of the Monarch&lt;/a&gt;, a powerful &lt;a href=\"Artifacts%20%28Morrowind%29\"&gt;artifact&lt;/a&gt; said to be &lt;a href=\"Enchant%20%28Morrowind%29\"&gt;enchanted&lt;/a&gt; with the soul of a Frost Monarch. She had sent fellow an Oracle, &lt;a href=\"Adusamsi%20Assurnarairan\"&gt;Adusamsi Assurnarairan&lt;/a&gt;, in search of the blade long ago. Adusamsi has failed to return, and Lalatia now fears the worst. The &lt;a href=\"Nerevarine\"&gt;Nerevarine&lt;/a&gt; is tasked with discovering Adusamsi's fate, and finding the Ice Blade.\nTravel to Rotheran.\nThe most direct route to &lt;a href=\"Rotheran\"&gt;Rotheran&lt;/a&gt; from Ebonheart is by &lt;a href=\"Ships%20%28Morrowind%29\"&gt;ship&lt;/a&gt;, with a stops at &lt;a href=\"Sadrith%20Mora%20%28Morrowind%29\"&gt;Sadrith Mora&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Dagon%20Fel\"&gt;Dagon Fel&lt;/a&gt; along the way. The &lt;a href=\"Dunmer%20stronghold\"&gt;Dunmer stronghold&lt;/a&gt; is located south of town, and either the east or west road may be taken out of Dagon Fel. After reaching &lt;a href=\"Punsabanit\"&gt;Punsabanit&lt;/a&gt; follow the road slightly to the west, headed south towards &lt;a href=\"Surirulk\"&gt;Surirulk&lt;/a&gt;. In clear weather Rotheran is visible from Surirulk's entrance.\nAtop the stairs are two non-hostile Dunmer. Although Rotheran has been overrun by bandits, not everyone is hostile, and there are a considerable number of slaves within. Enter the stronghold's arena prepared for battle.\nFind Llaren Terano.\n&lt;a href=\"Fevus%20Aryon\"&gt;Fevus Aryon&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Ereven%20Velas\"&gt;Ereven Velas&lt;/a&gt; are near the entrance and will attack on sight. Both the right and left paths lead to &lt;a href=\"Llaren%20Terano\"&gt;Llaren Terano&lt;/a&gt;, and involve encounters with hostile bandits along the way. If the Nerevarine wishes to free the slaves being held here, the Rotheran Slave Key is required and can be obtained from &lt;a href=\"Irvsie%20Othran\"&gt;Irvsie Othran&lt;/a&gt;. Unless unusually quick and quiet in disposing of enemies, the Nerevarine's activities are likely to attract of everyone on the upper level of the arena by the time Llaren is killed.\nThe Ice Blade, &lt;a href=\"Adusamsi%27s%20Ring\"&gt;Adusamsi's Ring&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Adusamsi%27s%20Robe\"&gt;Adusamsi's Robe&lt;/a&gt;, and the Slave Cell Key can all be found on Llaren's remains.\nFree Adusamsi Assurnarairan.\nThe door leading to the slaves is locked, and requires 45 &lt;a href=\"Security%20%28Morrowind%29\"&gt;Security&lt;/a&gt; to open unless the Slave Cell Key is used. Be prepared to battle two &lt;a href=\"Scamp%20%28Morrowind%29\"&gt;Scamps&lt;/a&gt; and a &lt;a href=\"Dremora%20Lord%20%28Morrowind%29\"&gt;Dremora Lord&lt;/a&gt; that guard the prisoners. Take care not to harm Wih-Eius and J'Raksa, two slaves who wander nearby.\nThere are three doors on the lower level. Behind the southwest door is a &lt;a href=\"Blight\"&gt;Blight&lt;/a&gt;ed &lt;a href=\"Nix-Hound%20%28Morrowind%29\"&gt;Nix-Hound&lt;/a&gt;, and behind the southeast door is a group of slaves. Adusamsi can be found by unlocking the northwest door, along with another group of slaves. She implores the Nerevarine to free her fellow slaves, and to be given her ring, which is enchanted to allow her a quick escape.\nUpon returning her ring, the Nerevarine has only one opportunity to retain Adusamsi's services as a &lt;a href=\"Skills%20%28Morrowind%29\"&gt;skill&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Trainers%20%28Morrowind%29\"&gt;trainer&lt;/a&gt; before she leaves, never to be seen again.\nReturn to Ebonheart.\nAfter exiting the arena, but before leaving the stronghold, the Rotheran Propylon Index can be acquired from &lt;a href=\"Rols%20Ienith\"&gt;Rols Ienith&lt;/a&gt; in the communal hut (required for the \"&lt;a href=\"Master%20Index%20%28Item%29\"&gt;Master Index&lt;/a&gt;\" &lt;a href=\"Master%20Index%20%28Plug-in%29\"&gt;plug-in&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Master%20Index%20%28Quest%29\"&gt;quest&lt;/a&gt;).\nWalk north from Rotheran and return to Dagon Fel. Take a ship to Sadrith Mora, then Ebonheart. At the Imperial Chapels, Lalatia offers the Nerevarine her thanks, admitting that she feared Adusamsi was dead.\nReward.\nThe Nerevarine is allowed to keep the Ice Blade. Adusamsi is nowhere to be found, but has left her ring with Lalatia to be given to the Nerevarine as a token of appreciation."}

They are often found in cold, or mountainous, regions.\nHistory.\nIce Wraiths are believed to be elemental manifestations arising out of &lt;a href=\"Nirn\"&gt;Nirn&lt;/a&gt;. They wield the power of their element, rather than using &lt;a href=\"Magic\"&gt;sorcery&lt;/a&gt; to manipulate it.\nIce Wraiths are lucid creatures of magic, in a serpentine form. Their appearance matches the terrain of Skyrim, making them difficult to see, and nearly invisible. Many Nords are killed by the creatures, either by the disease known as Witbane which they carry, or by their strike which forces their entire body through their target. Stories exist of the creatures killing entire merchant expeditions.\nDespite the dangers of the Ice Wraith, the creatures are simple minded, with combat being straight forward. They can easily be beaten by using brute force and a sharp blade. If they are defeated, their teeth can be taken, which are a prized ingredient of decent value. Another valuable enchanting ingredient held by the Ice Wraiths is White Ice. It can be used to keep diseases at bay, provoking and weakening an opponent, returning magicka, and enabling the user to cover ground at a faster rate, regardless of walking or running.\n&lt;a href=\"Second%20Era\"&gt;Second Era&lt;/a&gt;.\nDuring the Second Era, the &lt;a href=\"Old%20Holds\"&gt;Old Holds&lt;/a&gt; of Skyrim held a tradition for the young men in their territory. These men go out for weeks into Skyrim's mountains in the winter, hunting the Ice Wraiths in order to claim their full status as citizens.\n&lt;a href=\"Fourth%20Era\"&gt;Fourth Era&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe practice of killing an Ice Wraith to attain citizenship appears to have survived into the Fourth Era, though not on the same scale as it did in the past. The killing of Ice Wraiths is now performed as an initiation rite. The Nords of Skyrim have tested their mettle for ages by killing Ice Wraiths at &lt;a href=\"The%20Serpent%20Stone%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Serpentstone Island&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Galmar%20Stone-Fist\"&gt;Galmar Stone-Fist&lt;/a&gt; made use of this knowledge for the &lt;a href=\"Stormcloak\"&gt;Stormcloak&lt;/a&gt; army. Foreign Imperials and Nords, as well as all other races who Galmar was unsure about, were sent out to the island to kill an Ice Wraith, supposedly to test the resolve and the abilities of these recruits, as well as to see if their heart was in support of the Stormcloak cause."}

One of his commanding officers, &lt;a href=\"Beatia\"&gt;Beatia&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"Ylliolos\"&gt;Ylliolos&lt;/a&gt;, had been surprised in an ambush while returning from a meeting with the Emperor. She and her personal guard of five soldiers barely escaped, and were separated from their army. They fled across the desolate, sleet-painted rocky cliffs by foot. The attack had been so sudden, they had not even the time to don armor or get to their horses.\n\"If we can get to the &lt;a href=\"Gorvigh%20Ridge\"&gt;Gorvigh Ridge&lt;/a&gt;,\" hollered &lt;a href=\"Lieutenant%20Ascutus\"&gt;Lieutenant Ascutus&lt;/a&gt;, gesturing toward a peak off in the mist, his voice barely discernible over the wind. \"We can meet the legion you stationed in &lt;a href=\"Porhnak\"&gt;Porhnak&lt;/a&gt;.\"\nBeatia looked across the craggy landscape, through the windswept hoary trees, and shook her head: \"Not that way. We'll be struck down before we make it halfway to the mountain. You can see their horses' breath through the trees.\"\nShe directed her guard toward a ruined old keep on the frozen isthmus of &lt;a href=\"Nerone\"&gt;Nerone&lt;/a&gt;, across the bay from Gorvigh Ridge. Jutting out on a promontory of rock, it was like many other abandoned castles in northern Skyrim, remnants of &lt;a href=\"Reman%20Cyrodiil\"&gt;Reman Cyrodiil&lt;/a&gt;'s protective shield against the continent of Akavir. As they reached their destination and made a fire, they could hear the army of the warchiefs of &lt;a href=\"Danstrar\"&gt;Danstrar&lt;/a&gt; behind them, making camp on the land southwest, blocking the only escape but the sea. The soldiers assessed the stock of the keep while Beatia looked out to the fog-veiled water through the casements of the ruin.\nShe threw a stone, watching it skip across the ice trailing puffs of mist before it disappeared with a splash into a crack in the surface.\n\"No food or weaponry to be found, commander,\" Lieutenant Ascutus reported. \"There's a pile of armor in storage, but it's definitely taken on the elements over the years. I don't know if it's salvageable at all.\"\n\"We won't last long here,\" Beatia replied. \"The Nords know that we'll be vulnerable when night falls, and this old rock won't hold them off. If there's anything in the keep we can use, find it. We have to make it across the ice floe to the Ridge.\"\nAfter a few minutes of searching and matching pieces, the guards presented two very grimy, scuffed and cracked suits of chitin armor. Even the least proud of the adventurers and pirates who had looted the castle over the years had thought the shells of chitin beneath their notice. The soldiers did not dare to clean them: the dust looked to be the only adhesive holding them together.\n\"They won't offer us much protection, just slow us down,\" grimaced Ascutus. \"If we run across the ice as soon as it gets dark --\"\n\"Anyone who can plan and execute an ambush like the warchiefs of Danstrar will be expecting that. We need to move quickly, now, before they're any closer.\" Beatia drew a map of the bay in the dust, and then a semicircular path across the water, an arc stretching from the castle to the Gorvigh Ridge. \"The men should go the long way across the bay like so. The ice is thick there a ways from the shoreline, and there are a lot of rocks for cover.\"\n\"You're not staying behind to hold the castle!\"\n\"Of course not,\" Beatia shook her head and drew a straight line from the castle to the closest shore across the Bay. \"I'll take one of the chitin suits, and try to cross the water here. If you don't see or hear me when you've made it to land, don't wait -- just get to Porhnak.\"\nLieutenant Ascutus tried to dissuade his commander, but he knew that she was would never order one of her men to perform the suicidal act of diversion, that all would die before they reached Gorvigh Ridge if the warlords' army was not distracted. He could find only one way to honor his duty to protect his commanding officer. It was not easy convincing Commander Beatia that he should accompany her, but at last, she relented.\nThe sun hung low but still cast a diffused glow, illuminating the snow with a ghostly light, when the five men and one woman slipped through the boulders beneath the castle to the water's frozen edge. Beatia and Ascutus moved carefully and precisely, painfully aware of each dull crunch of chitin against stone. At their commander's signal, the four unarmored men dashed towards the north across the ice.\nWhen her men had reached the first fragment of cover, a spiral of stone jutting a few yards from the base of the promontory, Beatia turned to listen for the sound of the army above. Nothing but silence. They were still unseen. Ascutus nodded, his eyes through the helm showing no fear. The commander and her lieutenant stepped onto the ice and began to run.\nWhen Beatia had surveyed the bay from the castle ramparts, the crossing closest to shore had seemed like a vast, featureless plane of white. Now that she was down on the ice, it was even more flat and stark: the sheet of mist rose only up to their ankles, but it billowed up at their approach like the hand of nature itself was pointing out their presence to their enemies. They were utterly exposed. It came almost as a relief when Beatia heard one of the warchief's scouts whistle a signal to his masters.\nThey didn't have to turn around to see if the army was coming. The sound of galloping hoofs and the crash of trees giving way was very clear over the whistling wind.\nBeatia wished she could risk a glance to the north to see if her men were hidden from view, but she didn't dare. She could hear Ascutus running to her right, keeping pace, breathing hard. He was used to wearing heavier armor, but the chitin joints were so brittle and tight from years of disuse, it was all he could do to bend them.\nThe rocky shore to the Ridge still looked at eternity away when Beatia felt and heard the first volley of arrows. Most struck the ice at their feet with sharp cracking sounds, but a few nearly found home, ricocheting off their backs. She silently offered a prayer of thanks to whatever anonymous shellsmith, now long dead, had crafted the armor. They continued to run, as the first rain of arrows was quickly followed by a second and a third.\n\"Thanks, &lt;a href=\"Stendarr\"&gt;Stendarr&lt;/a&gt;,\" Ascutus gasped. \"If there was only leather in the keep, we'd be pierced through and through. Now if only it weren't... so rigid...\"\nBeatia felt her own armor joints begin to set, her knees and hips finding more and more resistance with every step. There could be no denying it: they were drawing closer toward the shore, but they were running much more slowly. She heard the first dreadful galloping crunch of the army charging across the floe toward them. The riders were cautious on the slippery ice, not driving their horses at full speed, but Beatia knew that they would be upon the two of them soon.\nThe old chitin armor could withstand the bite of a few arrows, but not the lance driven with the force of a galloping horse. The only great unknown was time.\nThe thunder of beating hooves was deafening behind them when Ascutus and Beatia reached the edge of the shore. The giant, jagged stones that strung around the beach blockaded the approach. Beneath their feet, the ice sighed and crackled. They could not stand still, run forward, nor run back. Straining against the tired metal in the armor joints, they took two bounds forward and flew at the boulders.\nThe first landing on the ice sounded an explosive crack. When they rose for the final jump, it was on a wave of water so cold it felt like fire through the thin armor. Ascutus's right hand found purchase in a deep fissure. Beatia gripped with both hands, but her boulder was slick with frost. Faces pressed to the stone, they could not turn to face the army behind them.\nBut they heard the ice splintering, and the soldiers cry out in terror for just an instant. Then there was no sound but the whining of the wind and the purring lap of the water. A moment later, there were footsteps on the cliff above.\nThe four guardsmen had crossed the bay. There were two to pull Beatia up from the face of the boulder, and another two for Ascutus. They strained and swore at the weight, but finally they had their commander and her lieutenant safely on the edge of Gorvigh Ridge.\n\"By &lt;a href=\"Mara\"&gt;Mara&lt;/a&gt;, that's heavy for light armor.\"\n\"Yes,\" smiled Beatia wearily, looking back over the empty broken ice flow, the cracks radiating from the parallel paths she and Ascutus had run. \"But sometimes that's good.\""}

At 5pm, she will head home and skip supper, this leads her to head straight to bed for six hours.\nDuring Loredas and Sundas instead of going to the All Saints Inn, she will head to\u00a0&lt;a href=\"The%20Bloated%20Float\"&gt;The Bloated Float&lt;/a&gt;\u00a0where she ends up wandering around from 1am-8am. She will then leave the Inn and head home to enjoy her two-hour breakfast. After finishing her breakfast on Loredas she will walk around the Temple District to socialize for two hours, not long before heading back home. (On Sundas she tends to skip the walk) From there she will then begin to wander around the ground floor of her home until she has her 5pm dinner. After the dinner she will head to her private quarters and then will sleep for roughly six hours.\nExceptions.\nSome exceptions do occur however, for example on the 28th day of each month at 1am she will head to Anvil. She crosses the Talos Bridge and head south on the\u00a0&lt;a href=\"Red%20Ring%20Road\"&gt;Red Ring Road&lt;/a&gt;\u00a0before finally heading west on the\u00a0&lt;a href=\"Gold%20Road%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;Gold Road&lt;/a&gt;, she will do her best to avoid the wildlife near the many ruins along the path. Eventually she will reach the vineyards near\u00a0&lt;a href=\"Skingrad%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;Skingrad&lt;/a&gt;. After roughly 12 hours of travel time she will finally reach her destination of Anvil at 5am the next morning. She will then depart from Anvil on the 30th at 12am in which she will arrive back at the Imperial City the next morning.\nDuring the quest\u00a0\"&lt;a href=\"An%20Unexpected%20Voyage\"&gt;An Unexpected Voyage&lt;/a&gt;\"\u00a0instead of boarding the Bloated Float, she will stand on the dock where the boat usually is and at the correct time she will continue her regular schedule. Also during the quest\u00a0\"&lt;a href=\"Light%20the%20Dragonfires\"&gt;Light the Dragonfires&lt;/a&gt;,\"\u00a0she is confined to her home, much like many of the other citizens.\nDialogue.\n\"My name is Ida Ottus, and I'd like to talk about Mother Mara.\""}

Most individuals who deal with the Masters are deceived, and subsequently their souls are condemned to the Soul Cairn. While there are theories, exactly why the Ideal Masters crave souls is unknown.\nPhysical form.\nIt has been speculated that the Ideal Masters have transcended beyond physical manifestation and now exist as non-corporeal beings. When they do interact with others, be it to feed on their victims or speak to their underlings, they do so through the crystalline structures that dot the Soul Cairn.\nSustenance.\nThe Ideal Masters' weakness is their hunger for pure souls. This hunger is believed to be the reason for the existence for the Soul Cairn itself, and it is often the only leverage &lt;a href=\"necromancer\"&gt;necromancer&lt;/a&gt;s have when bargaining with them. In return, the Ideal Masters grant them the ability to conjure powerful &lt;a href=\"undead\"&gt;undead&lt;/a&gt; guardians in a similar manner that conjurers would summon an &lt;a href=\"Atronach\"&gt;Atronach&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"Daedra\"&gt;Daedra&lt;/a&gt;.\nHowever, the Ideal Masters are known to trick anyone who enters into a bargain with them, and they often condemn the person to the Soul Cairn as a &lt;a href=\"Souls\"&gt;harvested soul&lt;/a&gt;\nInteractions.\n&lt;a href=\"Level%203\"&gt;Level 3&lt;/a&gt;.\nIn , the player will speak to the Ideal Masters as part of the &lt;a href=\"Soul%20Cairn%20%28Battlespire%29\"&gt;Soul Cairn&lt;/a&gt;\u00a0questline. Since the Daedric armies of &lt;a href=\"Mehrunes%20Dagon\"&gt;Mehrunes Dagon&lt;/a&gt; invaded the Soul Cairn, the Ideal Masters needed assistance in ridding the Soul Cairn of the Daedra. The Daedra planned to use it as a waystation between their own realms and their newly conquered domains. The Daedra killed the Masters' servants and plundered their treasure, although they also released the souls of several prominent mortal allies whom Dagon had betrayed into the realm. An apprentice &lt;a href=\"battlemage\"&gt;battlemage&lt;/a&gt; from the Battlespire entered the realm, following the retreating army. Most of the Ideal Masters are unwilling to help the player, but when they learned of the Daedric invaders who would supposedly continue to regularly pass through their realm, one Master instructs the player on how to use the Emerald Gates to leave the realm and continue stalking Dagon's army. The gates can then be used to travel to the &lt;a href=\"Shade%20Perilous\"&gt;Shade Perilous&lt;/a&gt;.\nDialogue.\nIf the gem is uncooperative:\n\"Who disturbs our rest?\"\nIf being ignored:\n\"&lt;a href=\"You%20address%20the%20gem%2C%20but%20there%20is%20no%20response.\"&gt;You address the gem, but there is no response.&lt;/a&gt;\"\nIf the gem is cooperative:\n\"Who disturbs our rest?\"\nIf approached again:\n\"Who disturbs us?\"\nDurnehviir.\nAt some point in history, a &lt;a href=\"dragon\"&gt;dragon&lt;/a&gt; named &lt;a href=\"Durnehviir\"&gt;Durnehviir&lt;/a&gt;\u00a0turned to necromancy to gain an advantage over his rivals. He was granted the power to accomplish feats such as summoning legions of undead. In exchange for this power, the Masters tasked him with guarding the Soul Cairn until a powerful necromancer named &lt;a href=\"Valerica\"&gt;Valerica&lt;/a&gt;, who was imprisoned there, died. Durnehviir accepted, but he did not know that Valerica was a &lt;a href=\"vampire\"&gt;vampire&lt;/a&gt; and therefore immortal. As result, Durnehviir was doomed to guard the Soul Cairn for eternity."}

She sides with &lt;a href=\"Mede%20Empire\"&gt;the Empire&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;a href=\"Civil%20War\"&gt;Civil War&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"Skyrim\"&gt;Skyrim&lt;/a&gt;. She purports to be a seer of psychic visions and dreams.\nPersonality.\nIdgrod appears relaxed, and chooses to quote phrases of wisdom and patience. She is quite wise and learned, but most of her people seem to think she is losing the plot due to her enigmatic personality and affiliation with magic. Though she aligns her Hold with the Empire, she is not particularly concerned with the war (a trait she shares with Jarl &lt;a href=\"Balgruuf%20the%20Greater\"&gt;Balgruuf the Greater&lt;/a&gt; of Whiterun) and also dislikes the Thalmor due to their ruthless and treacherous nature.\nBackground.\nShe associates herself with &lt;a href=\"Falion%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Falion&lt;/a&gt;, a newcomer to &lt;a href=\"Hjaalmarch\"&gt;Hjaalmarch&lt;/a&gt; and a &lt;a href=\"wizard\"&gt;wizard&lt;/a&gt;. Because of their kinship, she is mistrusted by the members of Morthal. However, although he is disliked by the rest of the town, she claims he is more altruistic than bothersome.\nSeveral individuals within Morthal despise her because she accepts Falion into her court, and because she seems not to bother with most \"petty\" problems in the hold. Idgrod has a daughter, &lt;a href=\"Idgrod%20the%20Younger\"&gt;Idgrod the Younger&lt;/a&gt;, and a son, &lt;a href=\"Joric\"&gt;Joric&lt;/a&gt;, whom she raises with her husband, and steward, &lt;a href=\"Aslfur\"&gt;Aslfur&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href=\"Gorm%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Gorm&lt;/a&gt; is her Housecarl.\nInteractions.\n&lt;a href=\"Diplomatic%20Immunity\"&gt;Diplomatic Immunity&lt;/a&gt;.\nIf the &lt;a href=\"Last%20Dragonborn\"&gt;Dragonborn&lt;/a&gt; has assisted her, or became Thane of Hjaalmarch, she recognizes who the Dragonborn is and, if prompted, provides the necessary distraction for the Dragonborn to slip away from &lt;a href=\"Elenwen%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Elenwen's&lt;/a&gt; party and continue the quest into the kitchen. Her attendance at the party, whilst the other Jarls did not attend unless certain conditions had been met, is unjustified. Idgrod walks over to &lt;a href=\"Razelan\"&gt;Razelan&lt;/a&gt; and begin making a scene, using him as the unwitting victim. Her justification for causing the scene is that \"an old woman can get away with anything.\" She may chat with Maven Black-Briar if she is in attendance.\n&lt;a href=\"Civil%20War\"&gt;Civil War&lt;/a&gt;.\nIf the Dragonborn decides to side with the &lt;a href=\"Stormcloaks\"&gt;Stormcloaks&lt;/a&gt;, Idgrod is replaced by &lt;a href=\"Sorli%20the%20Builder\"&gt;Sorli the Builder&lt;/a&gt; as Jarl of Morthal. Idgrod can then be found in the &lt;a href=\"Blue%20Palace%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Blue Palace&lt;/a&gt; in Solitude, along with the other replaced Jarls, Stewards, and Housecarls.\n&lt;a href=\"Laid%20to%20Rest\"&gt;Laid to Rest&lt;/a&gt;.\nSpeaking with a &lt;a href=\"citizen\"&gt;citizen&lt;/a&gt; about the burned down home in Morthal prompts the Dragonborn to seek out Idgrod. She needs the event to be investigated, since a young girl, &lt;a href=\"Helgi%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Helgi&lt;/a&gt;, died in the blaze. Investigating the site at night, the Dragonborn learns that the girl's ghost haunts the place. Idgrod claims Morthal is alive with spiritual energy and says to check the graveyard.\nReporting to the Jarl.\nAfter reporting Falion to the jarl, she will immediately find and confront him, threatening dire consequences for Falion if he continues his actions.

{"id": "1978", "revid": "17401442", "url": "https://elderscrolls.fandom.com/wiki?curid=1978", "title": "Hircine", "text": "Hircine (in &lt;a href=\"Daedric%20script\"&gt;Daedric script&lt;/a&gt;, ) is the main antagonist in and the &lt;a href=\"Daedric%20Prince\"&gt;Daedric Prince&lt;/a&gt; whose spirit is the hunt; the sports of &lt;a href=\"Daedra\"&gt;Daedra&lt;/a&gt;; the greatest game and the chase and sacrifice of &lt;a href=\"mortal\"&gt;mortal&lt;/a&gt;s. He is known by the titles \"The Huntsman of The Princes,\" \"The Father of Manbeasts\" and \"The Hungry Cat\" to Khajiit. The summoning date of Hircine is the 5th of &lt;a href=\"Mid%20Year\"&gt;Mid Year&lt;/a&gt;. He is also the creator of &lt;a href=\"Lycanthropy\"&gt;Lycanthropy&lt;/a&gt;.\nBackground.\nHircine, the Spirit of the Hunt's past, leads many to argue. He himself was never mentioned or heard of in the early histories of &lt;a href=\"Nirn\"&gt;Nirn&lt;/a&gt;. Some scholars believe because of this that Hircine was not one of the original Daedric Princes and is, therefore, a spawn or offshoot, similar to &lt;a href=\"Malacath\"&gt;Malacath&lt;/a&gt;. However this is often shunned on account of Hircine creating &lt;a href=\"Lycanthropes\"&gt;Lycanthropes&lt;/a&gt;, and the disease existing well into the &lt;a href=\"Merethic%20Era\"&gt;Merethic Era&lt;/a&gt;. Hircine also appears within the mortal realm once every thousand years; but not to destroy, like some princes, but to enjoy a great hunt known as the &lt;a href=\"Hircine%27s%20Hunt\"&gt;Bloodmoon Prophecy&lt;/a&gt;.\nBloodmoon Prophecy.\nThe Bloodmoon Prophecy is a legend of the &lt;a href=\"Skaal\"&gt;Skaal&lt;/a&gt;, a native group of &lt;a href=\"Nords\"&gt;Nords&lt;/a&gt; from &lt;a href=\"Solstheim%20%28Bloodmoon%29\"&gt;Solstheim&lt;/a&gt;. It foretells the Hunt of Hircine, an event which happens every era when the Prince enters &lt;a href=\"Mundus\"&gt;Mundus&lt;/a&gt; and releases his Hounds upon the land. The Hunt is preceded by four signs. The first is the coming of the \"Hounds,\" when werewolves appear on the island. The second is the \"Fire from the Eye of Glass,\" a pillar of fire which appears on the surface of the frozen &lt;a href=\"Lake%20Fjalding\"&gt;Lake Fjalding&lt;/a&gt;. The third is the \"Tide of Woe,\" a &lt;a href=\"horker\"&gt;horker&lt;/a&gt; massacre, the bodies of which then wash up all along the island's northern coast. The final sign is the namesake of the prophecy: the \"Bloodmoon,\" when &lt;a href=\"Secunda\"&gt;Secunda&lt;/a&gt; turns crimson from the blood of the Hunter's Prey.\nAfter the four signs is something called the \"Hunter's Game,\" which varies from era to era. The game might involve the hunting of an entire tribe or just one man. After the hunt, Hircine returns to his realm for another era. The most recent Bloodmoon Prophecy was in &lt;a href=\"3E%20427\"&gt;3E 427&lt;/a&gt;. It took place within the Mortrag Glacier.\nPopular opinion and worship.\nHircine is one of the more worshipped or, to a certain degree, accepted daedric princes. Although all daedra are completely shunned by mainstream &lt;a href=\"Imperial\"&gt;Imperial&lt;/a&gt; society, he is often worshipped in greater numbers compared to other daedra, even though he does not necessarily care for it. He is the father of man-beasts and is thusly worshipped by all kinds of lycanthropy-infected creatures such as &lt;a href=\"Werewolves\"&gt;Werewolves&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Wereboar\"&gt;Wereboar&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"Werebear\"&gt;Werebear&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"Werelion\"&gt;Werelion&lt;/a&gt;s, and &lt;a href=\"Werecrocodiles\"&gt;Werecrocodiles&lt;/a&gt;. He respects and even praises these creatures if they accomplish something in the hunt, a rare quality for a Daedra. He is often seen as the most honored huntsman to walk any plane of existence, and as such is often looked up to by other hunters, fishers, and trappers.\n&lt;a href=\"Reachmen\"&gt;Reachmen&lt;/a&gt; are particularly devoted to Hircine, and the Prince is one of the most prominent spirits in their mythology. Oral traditions of the Reachmen attribute five aspects to Hircine; &lt;a href=\"Alrabeg\"&gt;Alrabeg&lt;/a&gt; the Hunter, &lt;a href=\"Storihbeg\"&gt;Storihbeg&lt;/a&gt; the Man-Beast, &lt;a href=\"Uricanbeg\"&gt;Uricanbeg&lt;/a&gt; the Stag, &lt;a href=\"Gulibeg\"&gt;Gulibeg&lt;/a&gt; the Fox, and &lt;a href=\"Hrokkibeg\"&gt;Hrokkibeg&lt;/a&gt; the Bear. Some aspects also act as an emissary for Hircine's various functions in Reachmen belief, primarily to the end of culling the \"weak\" from the Prince's herd, for instance Gulibeg is considered a trickster who deceives mortals into foolish deaths, and Uricanbeg, as a stag, functions to actually breed out \"weakness\".\nPersonality.\n&lt;a href=\"Daedric%20Princes\"&gt;Daedric Princes&lt;/a&gt; are almost always looked on as evil due to their destructive nature. While there is some truth in this, this does not apply to all princes. Some princes respect honor and fairness among their subjects and are against dishonorable murder. Hircine is typically considered to be in this category. While he cannot exactly be seen as benevolent, he is very honorable and always gives his prey a sporting chance; he is even willing to be congratulatory to those who were deemed as prey if they manage to turn the hunt to their favor and become the hunters in turn. He is not needlessly destructive like many of his Daedric brethren. With those he does not care for he is often neutral in his trades, unless they are his prey.\nLycanthropy.\nHircine is the patron and creator of the &lt;a href=\"Lycanthropy\"&gt;lycanthropic condition&lt;/a&gt;. Evidence of this is given when, during the Bloodmoon, Werewolves (also known as Hircine's Hounds) acted as the hunters while the inhabitants of &lt;a href=\"Solstheim%20%28Bloodmoon%29\"&gt;Solstheim&lt;/a&gt; were their prey. The individual that can defeat the hounds is honored and would receive favors by the Prince himself, and face Hircine's aspect in one-on-one combat. He is believed by devotees and Hircine himself to be honored to be the prey of the Prince, though very few have survived this battle.\nOne artifact can suppress the bloodlust suffered under the lycanthropic condition; &lt;a href=\"Hircine%27s%20Ring\"&gt;Hircine's Ring&lt;/a&gt;. Sometime before the &lt;a href=\"Warp%20in%20the%20West\"&gt;Warp in the West&lt;/a&gt;, this ring was reported resurfaced in the &lt;a href=\"Iliac%20Bay\"&gt;Iliac Bay&lt;/a&gt;. The ring makes the Lycanthrope wielder able to turn to beast form or back at will and suppress the hunger. During the Bloodmoon in Solstheim, the enchantment somehow was changed. The ring can allow any person to turn to beast form at will, but for lycanthropes the bloodlust is still there.\nOn a side note, the witches of the &lt;a href=\"Glenmoril%20Wyrd%20Coven\"&gt;Glenmoril Wyrd Coven&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"High%20Rock\"&gt;High Rock&lt;/a&gt; are known to be worshippers of Hircine, and they will often perform a summoning for anyone that can pay their price. The witches are also able to cure anyone of &lt;a href=\"Lycanthropy\"&gt;Lycanthropy&lt;/a&gt;, an ability that is alluded to in the book.\nThe infected person, with the assistance of the witches, must perform a ritual called The Rite of the Wolf Giver. It is an elaborate ritual of dark magicka, requiring the sacrifice of both flesh and innocence. Also, certain ingredients, which are petals of a wolfsbane flower and one bunch of ripened belladonna berries, are needed by the witches to concoct a potion for the rite.\nArtifacts.\nOne particularly famous artifact of Hircine, and the one he is most commonly associated with is the &lt;a href=\"Cuirass%20of%20the%20Savior%27s%20Hide\"&gt;Cuirass of the Savior's Hide&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe book \"&lt;a href=\"Tamrielic%20Lore\"&gt;Tamrielic Lore&lt;/a&gt;\" has this to say about the Cuirass:\n\"The Cuirass has the special ability to resist magicka. Legend has it that Hircine rewarded his peeled hide to the first and only mortal to have ever escaped his hunting grounds. This unknown mortal had the hide tailored into this magical Cuirass for his future adventures. The Savior's Hide has a tendency to travel from hero to hero as though it has a mind of its own.\"\nThis artifact has surfaced multiple times, such as in , where it is required to wield the &lt;a href=\"Spear%20of%20Bitter%20Mercy\"&gt;Spear of Bitter Mercy&lt;/a&gt;. Another occasion when it was shown was in &lt;a href=\"Tel%20Fyr%20%28Morrowind%29\"&gt;Tel Fyr&lt;/a&gt;, the house of &lt;a href=\"Divayth%20Fyr\"&gt;Divayth Fyr&lt;/a&gt;. Divayth, an ancient &lt;a href=\"House%20Telvanni%20%28Morrowind%29\"&gt;House Telvanni&lt;/a&gt; Wizard and also an artifact collector, was once able to procure the artifact. He then invites Thieves to steal them from the &lt;a href=\"Corprusarium\"&gt;Corprusarium&lt;/a&gt;. It then later appears in the , as a reward for completing the Hircine's Shrine Quest.\nAnother &lt;a href=\"Daedric%20Artifact\"&gt;artifact&lt;/a&gt; gifted by Hircine is the &lt;a href=\"Hircine%27s%20Ring%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Ring of Hircine&lt;/a&gt;, available in . The ring allows the wearer additional werewolf transformations each day. At the end of the quest, the player must select to side with the werewolf or the hunters. If the player sides with the werewolf then they get the &lt;a href=\"Hircine%27s%20Ring%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Ring of Hircine&lt;/a&gt; whereas siding with the hunters gives the player the &lt;a href=\"Savior%27s%20Hide%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Savior's Hide&lt;/a&gt;. An alternative is to side with the werewolf and to get the ring and then kill and skin him before leaving the grotto.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Rueful%20Axe\"&gt;Rueful Axe&lt;/a&gt; was created by &lt;a href=\"Clavicus%20Vile\"&gt;Clavicus Vile&lt;/a&gt; so the father of a Hircine worshipper could cure his daughter's curse by killing her.\nHistory.\n&lt;a href=\"Umbriel%20Crisis\"&gt;Umbriel Crisis&lt;/a&gt;.\nIn &lt;a href=\"4E%2048\"&gt;4E 48&lt;/a&gt;, Prince &lt;a href=\"Attrebus%20Mede\"&gt;Attrebus&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Sul\"&gt;Sul&lt;/a&gt; needed a fast way to travel to &lt;a href=\"Vivec%20City\"&gt;Vivec City&lt;/a&gt;. Sul had made a trail which ended in &lt;a href=\"Morrowind\"&gt;Morrowind&lt;/a&gt; to escape from &lt;a href=\"Oblivion\"&gt;Oblivion&lt;/a&gt; when he was trapped in &lt;a href=\"Umbriel\"&gt;Umbriel&lt;/a&gt;. They decided to use an inactive &lt;a href=\"Oblivion%20Gate\"&gt;Oblivion Gate&lt;/a&gt; from the &lt;a href=\"Oblivion%20Crisis\"&gt;Oblivion Crisis&lt;/a&gt; to access such trail, but they ended up in &lt;a href=\"Hircine%27s%20Hunting%20Grounds\"&gt;Hircine's Hunting Grounds&lt;/a&gt;. Hircine and his beasts gave chase to the intruders. Sul knew where the door that would take them out of Hircine's realm was, so they mounted the &lt;a href=\"Khajiit\"&gt;Khajiits&lt;/a&gt; from &lt;a href=\"Lesspa%23F.E2.80.99aashe_clan\"&gt;Faashe clan&lt;/a&gt;.\nHircine would not show up until after dark, when he would attack with a pack of werewolves. They eventually heard the voice of a horn sound incredibly deep; Hircine was approaching. They were still fifty yards away from the portal, so &lt;a href=\"Lesspa\"&gt;Lesspa&lt;/a&gt; and the remaining Khajiits sacrificed to buy time for Attrebus and Sul. They fought against Hircine, presumably dying.\nQuests.\nIn , the &lt;a href=\"Hero%20of%20Daggerfall\"&gt;Hero of Daggerfall&lt;/a&gt; contacted Hircine through the &lt;a href=\"Glenmoril%20Witches\"&gt;Glenmoril Witches&lt;/a&gt; and won Hircine's Ring in exchange for hunting a \nrogue Wereboar.\nIn , the &lt;a href=\"Nerevarine\"&gt;Nerevarine&lt;/a&gt; received one of his artifacts, the Spear of Bitter Mercy, as a reward for killing a Giant Bull Netch with the Fork of Horripilation. Although in this case, the spear was a reward from &lt;a href=\"Sheogorath\"&gt;Sheogorath&lt;/a&gt;, it is more usually associated with Hircine. The Nerevarine fought and defeated Hircine when he attempted to enter the mortal plane in Solstheim. Hircine's typical lackeys on the mortal realm Nirn are werewolves, which he directly talks to, gives tasks, and rewards with additional powers. Hircine hosts a great hunt every era, pitting various prey of his choosing against one another. The exact nature of each hunt varies from era to era.\nSeveral years later, in , he requested that the &lt;a href=\"Champion%20of%20Cyrodiil\"&gt;Champion of Cyrodiil&lt;/a&gt; hunt for a unicorn's horn, offering the Savior's Hide as a reward.\nIn , it is revealed that &lt;a href=\"the%20Circle\"&gt;the Circle&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"the%20Companions\"&gt;the Companions&lt;/a&gt; are werewolves as a result of &lt;a href=\"Terrfyg\"&gt;Terrfyg&lt;/a&gt;, a Harbinger of the Companions, having made a deal with the Glenmoril Witches for power in exchange for Hircine bringing them to his &lt;a href=\"Hircine%27s%20Hunting%20Grounds\"&gt;Hunting Grounds&lt;/a&gt; instead of &lt;a href=\"Sovngarde%20%28Location%29\"&gt;Sovngarde&lt;/a&gt; upon death. The Witches are slain by the &lt;a href=\"Last%20Dragonborn\"&gt;Last Dragonborn&lt;/a&gt;, who uses the head of one of them to posthumously cure &lt;a href=\"Kodlak%20Whitemane\"&gt;Kodlak Whitemane&lt;/a&gt;, the latest Harbinger, of his lycanthropy so that he can go to Sovngarde instead of the Hunting Grounds.\nLater on, a Nord werewolf named &lt;a href=\"Sinding\"&gt;Sinding&lt;/a&gt; stole the Ring of Hircine in an attempt to control his transformations. However, this plan backfired when Hircine cursed the ring, causing Sinding to transform at random, killing a child and ending up in jail. Soon after, the Dragonborn met Sinding, who tasked the &lt;a href=\"Last%20Dragonborn\"&gt;Dragonborn&lt;/a&gt; to take the ring and free it from its curse by hunting the White Stag, before escaping from jail. Hircine then requested that the Dragonborn hunt Sinding down and tear the skin from his body. After confronting Sinding a second time, the Dragonborn was left with the choice to kill him in order to receive Hircine's favor and the Savior's Hide or to kill the other hunters trying to get Hircine's favor and receive the uncursed ring. Whichever option the Dragonborn chose, Hircine will be pleased with the results; if the Dragonborn helps Sinding, Hircine says that the important thing is that \"a\" hunt took place, regardless of who was the hunter and who was the hunted."}

There, Songamdir will tell you to use the altar and speak to Hircine himself. Hircine will tell you that in order to be accepted into the pack, you must hunt down a prey and then howl to your brothers and sisters.

If the Nerevarine is not a werewolf, make sure that they are armed with a silver weapon they are best at weilding before doing so but if the Nerevarine is a Werewolf, they will see the transformation cutscene; if not, they will wake up surrounded by werewolves. The Nerevarine will then be in a Glacier Ice Maze in the &lt;a href=\"Mortrag%20Glacier\"&gt;Mortrag Glacier&lt;/a&gt;. Talking to Hircine will reveal that he kidnapped the four toughest warriors on &lt;a href=\"Solstheim%20%28Bloodmoon%29\"&gt;Solstheim&lt;/a&gt; so that he could lead them through his maze, killing each other until only one remains. He tells the Nerevarine to head through the maze and will then disappear.\nHead through the door, and one will find Captain Carius; if they are in werewolf form, he will attack them, but if not, the Nerevarine will have to escort him through the maze and find the key for the gate. If one is a werewolf, they do not need to find the key, and the &lt;a href=\"Detect%20Animal\"&gt;Detect Animal&lt;/a&gt; skill will allow the Nerevarine to check for the whereabouts of nearby hostile werewolves. One should avoid the Statues of Werewolves and make their way to the center of the maze.\nCarius will stay behind, but when the Nerevarine goes through the door, they will meet Tharsten Heart-Fang. If one is in werewolf form, he will turn into a werewolf and attack them, but if not they can escort him through the maze, where he will later become a werewolf and attack the Nerevarine (he will attack them regardless of their actions). Killing him will magically give the Nerevarine the &lt;a href=\"Hircine%27s%20Ring%20%28Bloodmoon%29\"&gt;Hircine's Ring&lt;/a&gt;, which allows them to turn into a werewolf whenever they want. Head to the center of the maze and through the gate. The Nerevarine will then be attacked by the Frost Giant Karstaag then they must be prepared to kill him and avoid using any enchated weapons with offensive spells or casting any on him as it'll be even more difficult to kill him in this manner. After it is killed, Hircine will appear.\n\"So...you are the one. You have escaped my hounds and beaten back the other challengers. I had rather expected the giant to prevail, but no matter. You have proven yourself a worthy hunter, and you have earned the greatest honor that can be bestowed upon a mortal: you are to be my prey. I ask you, though: what is it that makes a hunter great. Is it his strength? The speed with which he strikes? Or is it his guile, the ability to outwit his prey? Answer me, mortal, and decide your fate.\"\n\"What is the hunter's greatest strength?\"\nOne has to choose one of his aspects to fight: either Speed, Strength or Guile. Speed turns him into a wolf (very fast), Strength turns him into a bear (very strong) and Guile makes one fight his true form (a balance of being fast, strong and able to use spells). The Nerevarine must kill his aspect and loot its corpse (make sure to wait until the Nerevarine is no longer a werewolf if initially transformed for the battle).\nReward.\nDepending on the chosen aspect, the rewards are the followings:\nEpilogue.\nAfter the aspect of Hircine vanquished and the reward recovered, everything begins to crumble around the Nerevarine and the Nerevarine must then flee. After that, the Nerevarine must watch the cutscene. If Nerevarine is not a werewolf, Korst Wind-Eye awaits Nerevarine in the &lt;a href=\"Skaal%20Village%20%28Bloodmoon%29\"&gt;Skaal Village&lt;/a&gt; to congratulate him. And if Captain Falx Carius was not killed in the Mortrag Glacier, the Nerevarine can find him at &lt;a href=\"Fort%20Frostmoth%20%28Bloodmoon%29\"&gt;Fort Frostmoth&lt;/a&gt; after miraculously escaping the disaster."}

Those who have contracted &lt;a href=\"Lycanthropy\"&gt;Lycanthropy&lt;/a&gt; will also be sent to the Hunting Grounds after death to hunt with Hircine for all eternity. It is also believed that any &lt;a href=\"Daedric%20Cult\"&gt;Daedric Cult&lt;/a&gt; that worships Hircine will also hunt with Hircine after death.

Anyone who dies in this realm remains in it forever. \nGeography.\nGeographically, the plane is made up mostly of dense woodland and vast grasslands and plains. Mortals entering these realms are typically hunted down by the inhabitants. it can be described as an endless forest. Herds of antelopes with twisting horns inhabit this area, as well large, six feet high cattle with an almost equal shoulder and horn span. The souls of lycanthropes who die are claimed by Hircine and spend eternity in his Hunting Grounds, however, should their souls be cleansed before being reclaimed by Hircine, they can still go to their racially specified afterlife.

Lycanthropes who possess the ring are not affected by bloodlust or by the moons.\nBy game.\nThe Ring makes various appearances throughout \"The Elder Scrolls\" and the methods of acquiring it are different in each game:\nBackground.\n&lt;a href=\"Tharsten%20Heart-Fang\"&gt;Tharsten Heart-Fang&lt;/a&gt;, the leader of the Skaal of &lt;a href=\"Solstheim\"&gt;Solstheim&lt;/a&gt;, was secretly in possession of the &lt;a href=\"Ring%20of%20Hircine\"&gt;Ring of Hircine&lt;/a&gt; for many years, unnaturally lengthening his life and youth.\nHowever, in the events leading up to the &lt;a href=\"Warp%20in%20the%20West\"&gt;Warp in the West&lt;/a&gt;, an agent of the &lt;a href=\"Blades\"&gt;Blades&lt;/a&gt; summoned Hircine through the Glenmorial Coven and was told to kill an ungrateful &lt;a href=\"wereboar\"&gt;wereboar&lt;/a&gt;. In return, a worshipper of Hircine gave the ring to the agent. By 3E 427, Tharsten was once again in possession of the ring until he was captured by the Hounds of Hircine to act as Prey during the fulfillment of the &lt;a href=\"Bloodmoon%20Prophecy\"&gt;Bloodmoon Prophecy&lt;/a&gt;. He was brought to the icy tunnels within the &lt;a href=\"Mortrag%20Glacier\"&gt;Mortrag Glacier&lt;/a&gt;, and took part in &lt;a href=\"Hircine%27s%20Hunt\"&gt;Hircine's Hunt&lt;/a&gt;.

The Nerevarine defeated him and became the new owner of the ring.\nAround 4E 201, a Nord werewolf named &lt;a href=\"Sinding\"&gt;Sinding&lt;/a&gt; stole the Ring of Hircine in an attempt to control his transformations into beast form. His plan backfired when Hircine cursed the ring, causing the wearer to transform at random and making it impossible to take off unless another willingly accepts it. Sinding was captured in Falkreath and thrown in jail for the murder of a young girl while in his beast form. The Last &lt;a href=\"Last%20Dragonborn\"&gt;Dragonborn&lt;/a&gt; visited Sinding in his jail cell, and accepted the ring from him, hoping to appease Hircine and have the curse removed. Sinding escaped from jail, and the Dragonborn hunted down a rare &lt;a href=\"White%20Stag\"&gt;White Stag&lt;/a&gt; to earn the Prince's favor. Upon contacting Hircine, the Dragonborn learned that the Prince would not forgive Sinding's betrayal, and had tasked hunters with killing and skinning him in return for the Savior's Hide. It is unknown if the Dragonborn joined the Hunt and lost the ring, saved Sinding from the hunters and had Hircine remove the curse, or betrayed Sinding by eliminating the hunters before turning on him and claiming both artifacts."}

This ring does not bestow the power of transformation at will, which is obtained only through &lt;a href=\"the%20Companions\"&gt;the Companions&lt;/a&gt; questline, begun in &lt;a href=\"Jorrvaskr\"&gt;Jorrvaskr&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Whiterun%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Whiterun&lt;/a&gt;. To keep the cursed variant, the unequipped cursed ring can be given to a follower before completing the quest.\n\"Uncursed\" Ring of Hircine.\nThe \"uncursed\" ring is granted to the Dragonborn by Hircine; who removes the curse, at the end of the quest \"Ill Met by Moonlight.\" Choosing to help Sinding allows the Dragonborn to receive the ring once they leave the cave, but if Sinding is killed and skinned, &lt;a href=\"Savior%27s%20Hide%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;the Savior's Hide&lt;/a&gt; is received instead.\nEffect of the ring.\nEquipping this ring grants werewolves unlimited transformations. Upon use of the ring's power, the Dragonborn will assume their Beast Form, and after the bloodthirst has depleted, will transform back to their original form. The Dragonborn can then simply re-equip the ring and re-use the power to transform into a werewolf again.\nUsage.\nEquipping the uncursed \"Ring of Hircine\" will cause a power of the same name to appear in the Powers section of the Magic tab, activated in the same way as any other power. Note that it does not affect the standard Beast Form power, which only functions once a day regardless as to whether the ring is worn or not.\nIf the Dragonborn has never contracted or has already cured their lycanthropy, the ring has no effect. But, as of patches 1.3 and 1.4, the ring may be used even after being cured \"(details needed - presumably it works just once, and then only if it was equipped at the time of cleansing?)\"."}

One strategy is to jump up on something and shoot it with silver arrows, then finish it off with a sword or dagger.\nMethod two.\nAnother method would be to mount the Unicorn (by avoiding the Minotaurs completely and approaching it without a weapon drawn), and leading it to fight difficult monsters. Despite its strength, it's just like any other horse in the game, in that it has a slow overall attack speed and a high knockback rate (low agility). Lead it into a confrontation with a quick, difficult creature (Clannfear, Mountain Lions, sometimes the quick attacks of a Black or Brown Bear will finish it), and finish off the creatures (or grab the unicorn horn and run) once the Unicorn is dead. A variant of this method is to ride the unicorn back to the shrine, whereupon dismounting, the other worshippers will attack it.\nMethod three.\nA third method is to mount the unicorn and travel to a high cliff. Jump off the cliff (which is not too high) while riding the unicorn and it will suffer fall damage; repeat until the unicorn has died.\nMethod four.\nAnother Method is to use a destruction staff (e.g. Staff of Shock) and electrocute the Unicorn and Minotaurs. It is also good to have Shadowmere (rewarded after a Dark Brotherhood quest) as she can attract some of the attention (she attacks enemies which makes her useful and is quite fast).\nMethod five.\nTake the unicorn into &lt;a href=\"Cloud%20Ruler%20Temple\"&gt;Cloud Ruler Temple&lt;/a&gt;, close the gates, and let it watch the two &lt;a href=\"Blades%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;Blades&lt;/a&gt; fight. This causes it to attack and the Blades will kill it."}

The Breton took the two mercenaries to Labyrinthian, where he astonished them with his use of the Wooden Mask in order to time travel.\nTowards the end of the journey, the mercenary grew tired of waiting for the scholar and promised that if he showed up again he would \"put this dagger through his chest to keep him in one place.\" This proved true as the &lt;a href=\"Skeleton%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;skeleton&lt;/a&gt; found with the mask can be found with an &lt;a href=\"Orcish%20Dagger%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Orcish Dagger&lt;/a&gt; through its ribcage.\nIn connection with &lt;a href=\"Captain%20Valmir\"&gt;Captain Valmir&lt;/a&gt; (found at Forelhost) and a note on his corpse, it seems the Breton was a scholar or mage hired by the &lt;a href=\"Thalmor%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Thalmor&lt;/a&gt; to find the &lt;a href=\"Dragon%20Priest%20Masks%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Dragon Priest masks&lt;/a&gt;, or at the very least attempt to understand the mystery surrounding the Labyrinthians ruins. By the Breton's corpse and Valmir's demise by the &lt;a href=\"Last%20Dragonborn\"&gt;Dragonborn&lt;/a&gt;, it can be assumed this mission was a total failure.\nContents.\nIt seemed like an easy enough job. Groz and me done plenty like it before. Some chinless Breton wants bodyguards for a trip into the mountains. Fine. Easy clink for us.\nHe goes on about this twice-forsaken mask of his the whole way, of course. Got a pretty good laugh when Groz snatched it and put it on her face - he threatened to fire us for that one. Not smart out here on your own, he realized that right fast and shut up about not paying.\nSo we get here, he thumbs through some papers and mutters to himself - never you mind that me and Groz had to cut through ten stinking trolls just to get him here - and without so much as a warning, poof. He's put on that mask and vanished. Could have put my hands on his throat one moment, the next he's not so much as thin air.\nWell, after a while we didn't know what to do, and Groz picks her gear up to head home, when he poofs back, that mask in his hand. Begs us not to leave, says he needs us to wait, this is what he's paying us for. Then puts the mask back on his sorry face and he's gone again. I'd seen cloaks do invisibility before, but a few swings of my fist proved he wasn't pulling that one. Nothing there to hit.\nHe shows up again, tells us he just needs more time. Has to figure out something about other masks, and vanishes again. That was yesterday, and I'm done with twiddling my thumbs and writing letters to myself. We're leaving come sunrise, and if he shows up again I promise &lt;a href=\"Azura\"&gt;Azura&lt;/a&gt; I'm putting this dagger through his chest to keep him in one place. We'll pull more loot off him dead than he could have paid alive. But not the mask. That cursed thing can stay and rot with him and the trolls right here."}

Things just aren't going right. Never have gone right, really. No one seems to care either, nor even notice I exist. Not that I'd have much to say even if someone had wanted to be my friend. I'd make a lousy friend anyway. I'm probably even boring the person reading this. I'm certainly boring myself. Not that anyone will ever find this note. Oh, but if they do!\nIf they do it means that I've been granted my greatest wish! To be released from this mortal coil. This isn't a suicide note, no.

Who wants that kind of existence, to be reborn on a &lt;a href=\"Hill%20of%20Suicides\"&gt;hill&lt;/a&gt; every day, reset as if nothing ever happened? That's even worse than the life I'm living.

Never have been happy, really.\nAnyway, the purpose of this note is to say to the man or woman who has killed me: \"Thank you!\"\nAll I really have is this queer little ring. A wizard gave it to me once, said I reminded him of his dead son. I guess I resemble his dead son even more now. Anyway, he said it would make me happy. Lift the weight of the world off my shoulders or some such thing. Come to think of it, it's the only time anyone has ever given me anything. Personally, I think the thing is worthless. Just like me.\nI tried it for a while, the \"&lt;a href=\"Ring%20of%20Happiness\"&gt;Happiness Ring&lt;/a&gt;\" but eventually I couldn't wear it anymore. It made me feel odd -- not myself. I didn't like feeling that way so I locked it away. It's pretty enough, though. It might fetch a few gold coins at the merchant. Sorry not to leave much more behind. But, my life never really amounted to much anyway, did it?\nYours very truly,\nHirrus Clutumnus, deceased"}

{"id": "3086", "revid": "17401442", "url": "https://elderscrolls.fandom.com/wiki?curid=3086", "title": "Hist", "text": "The Hist are a race of sentient trees that are said to have once been spread over a wide area of &lt;a href=\"Nirn\"&gt;Nirn&lt;/a&gt;, but are now almost solely confined to &lt;a href=\"Black%20Marsh\"&gt;Black Marsh&lt;/a&gt;. Some claim that they are the most ancient race on Nirn. They are associated with the &lt;a href=\"Argonians\"&gt;Argonians&lt;/a&gt;, who venerate them, but they are not worshipped in the traditional sense of the term.\nInformation on the Hist is scarce, as the Argonians do not readily share such information with others, and may even view such sharing as a betrayal of their race.\nBiology.\nThe Hist are a kind of tree in appearance. Some say the Hist are mobile, although this has not been verified beyond rumor. They draw water not only as a source of nourishment, but also a repertoire of memories, although this may be figurative.\nThe Hist are interconnected with each other, and can communicate with one another through that link. They also communicate with those who ingest &lt;a href=\"Hist%20Sap\"&gt;Hist Sap&lt;/a&gt; in the right manner, and are considered by Argonians to be a part of them, on a level that is potentially biological. Hist roots stretch very far, deep into the heart of &lt;a href=\"Nirn\"&gt;Nirn&lt;/a&gt; and out into distant lands. Hist trees sometimes sprout large hanging flowers, which emit an either red or &lt;a href=\"Dead-Water%20Tribe\"&gt;blue&lt;/a&gt; glow. One tribe located deep within Black Marsh are said to be dedicated to ice magic and have Hist trees that drip with icicles. \"Hist-Brothers\" are shadowy &lt;a href=\"lurcher\"&gt;lurcher&lt;/a&gt;s encountered during the quest \"&lt;a href=\"The%20Dream%20of%20the%20Hist\"&gt;The Dream of the Hist&lt;/a&gt;,\" and are the embodiment of various Hist Trees seen throughout &lt;a href=\"Shadowfen\"&gt;Shadowfen&lt;/a&gt;.\nHist Sap.\nThe Hist produce a sap that is used by Argonians in a variety of cultural practices, as well as which stimulating particular growth patterns in the Argonian, which determine its gender. The sap also induces visions for Argonians, who treat these as sacred experiences. It is also prized by other races as an ingredient, and tainted samples can function as a hallucinogen. In sufficient quantities, the sap is poisonous to all races. Hist sap that bleeds from Hist roots buried deep underground is known as \"deep sap.\"\nHistory.\nArgonians consider the Hist to be the source of all life. According to the &lt;a href=\"A%20Children%27s%20Anuad\"&gt;Anuad&lt;/a&gt;, they are mentioned as being one of the two forms of life to emerge from the ruin of the Twelve Worlds, the other being the &lt;a href=\"Ehlnofey\"&gt;Ehlnofey&lt;/a&gt;. It is also claimed that the Hist originated from &lt;a href=\"Oblivion%20%28Realm%29\"&gt;Oblivion&lt;/a&gt;, although it is possible that they merely fled there to escape the decimation of their realm on Nirn. Since &lt;a href=\"Umbriel\"&gt;Umbriel&lt;/a&gt; also came from Oblivion, the trees in Umbriel could be cousins of the Hist. The trees from &lt;a href=\"Clavicus%20Vile\"&gt;Clavicus Vile&lt;/a&gt;'s realm are vaguer than the Hist, not as intelligent or maybe simpler. But like the Hist, they can form their sap into different things, and they can shape life, change its form.\nAt some point in history, much of the Hist's realm on Mundus disappeared. Some claim this happened as a result of the &lt;a href=\"Ehlnofey\"&gt;Ehlnofey&lt;/a&gt; wars, although other sources claim that the Hist were decimated later, when the &lt;a href=\"Dwemer\"&gt;Dwemer&lt;/a&gt; chopped them down for wood. There is an account of the Hist of Haj Uxjith taking its Argonians and fleeing to &lt;a href=\"Oblivion\"&gt;Oblivion&lt;/a&gt; to avoid this fate in the \"ancient past,\" which may refer to the event mentioned in the \"&lt;a href=\"The%20Annotated%20Anuad\"&gt;Anuad&lt;/a&gt;\".\nThe Hist brought Argonians back to Black Marsh to defend against the &lt;a href=\"Oblivion%20Crisis\"&gt;Oblivion Crisis&lt;/a&gt; at the end of the &lt;a href=\"Third%20Era\"&gt;Third Era&lt;/a&gt;, directing them in attacks that defeated &lt;a href=\"Mehrunes%20Dagon\"&gt;Mehrunes Dagon&lt;/a&gt;'s forces, and then on to the subsequent invasion of &lt;a href=\"Morrowind\"&gt;Morrowind&lt;/a&gt; following the &lt;a href=\"Red%20Year\"&gt;Red Year&lt;/a&gt;.\nA rogue Hist was part of the creation of &lt;a href=\"Umbriel\"&gt;Umbriel&lt;/a&gt; in the early &lt;a href=\"Fourth%20Era\"&gt;Fourth Era&lt;/a&gt;.\nCulture.\nThe Hist do not have a distinct culture of their own that has been disclosed in any great depth. In theory the link they share allows them to operate in unison, suggesting a monolithic mindset. On occasions divergent opinions emerge among the Hist. This results in them being \"purged\" from the other Hist, as was done by the Hist of &lt;a href=\"Lilmoth\"&gt;Lilmoth&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;a href=\"Third%20Era\"&gt;Third Era&lt;/a&gt;.\nRelationship to the Argonians.\nThe Argonians revere the Hist, considering them to be both their prior existence and their afterlife.\nThe Hist form part of many Argonian cultural rituals, as well as forming a central part of Argonian tribal village life. It is possible that the Hist form the root of their social structure, with each village forming around a single Hist tree. Argonians claim the ability to communicate with the Hist, although precise practices for doing so vary from tribe to tribe of Argonians. This communication takes on the significance of religious guidance for Argonians. The &lt;a href=\"Bright-Throat%20Tribe\"&gt;Bright-Throat Tribe&lt;/a&gt; believes that their Hist communicate through the wind, and they create chimes in order to receive its messages.\nThe Hist play a central part in an Argonian's coming-of-age ceremony, whereby they ingest Hist sap, and are formally named. It is also possible that the ingestion of sap also affects the social awareness of Argonians, although this may be a function of Argonian society in general. Some Argonians also believe that the Hist guide their choice of mate. This has been recorded as an annual event by some scholars, although accounts of individual couplings exist.\nIn extreme circumstances, the Hist have communicated with the entire Argonian race, as well as altering large numbers of them when they ingest Hist sap. This was done during the &lt;a href=\"Oblivion%20Crisis\"&gt;Oblivion Crisis&lt;/a&gt;, where the Hist recalled many Argonians to Black Marsh and invaded the &lt;a href=\"Oblivion%20Gate%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;Oblivion Gates&lt;/a&gt;, closing them, and co-ordinated the later invasion of &lt;a href=\"Morrowind\"&gt;Morrowind&lt;/a&gt;.\nIt is possible that the Hist feel the need for Argonians around them and consider them their \"children,\" but this may be a literary device.\nIn &lt;a href=\"Jel\"&gt;Jel&lt;/a&gt;, a language spoken by Argonians, Hist saplings are referred to as \"Hist-Deek,\" mature Hists are called \"Hist-Dooka,\" and elder Hists are called \"Hist-Tsoko.\" The names of the stages of a Hist's development are also used as months within the Argonian calendar."}

The elves lived mostly in underground cities and controlled central &lt;a href=\"Tamriel\"&gt;Tamriel&lt;/a&gt; with an iron fist. Each city contained a &lt;a href=\"Great%20Welkynd%20Stone\"&gt;Great Welkynd Stone&lt;/a&gt;, precious and extremely valuable artifacts that were almost all plundered by the end of the &lt;a href=\"Third%20Era\"&gt;Third Era&lt;/a&gt;. The last stone was discovered by the &lt;a href=\"Hero%20of%20Kvatch\"&gt;Hero of Kvatch&lt;/a&gt; in the final year of the Third Era.

One human slave, a female named &lt;a href=\"Alessia\"&gt;Alessia&lt;/a&gt;, thought that the slavery and suffering of humans was wrong and prayed to the chief deity of the &lt;a href=\"Nine%20Divines\"&gt;Nine Divines&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Akatosh\"&gt;Akatosh&lt;/a&gt;, the Dragon God of Time. Alessia asked Akatosh for assistance in a rebellion against the elves. The humans were weaker than the elves and had no suitable tools for battle. To make matters worse for the humans, the elves had an army of &lt;a href=\"Daedra\"&gt;Daedra&lt;/a&gt; at their side so any human rebellion would fail if attempted.\nAkatosh blessed St. Alessia with the dragon blood and made a Covenant that so long as Alessia's generations were true to the dragon blood, Akatosh would endeavor to seal tight the gates of Oblivion, and to deny the armies of Daedra and undead to their enemies, the Daedra-loving Ayleids.\nIn token of this Covenant, Akatosh gave to Alessia and her descendants the Amulet of Kings and the Eternal &lt;a href=\"Dragonfires\"&gt;Dragonfires&lt;/a&gt; of the Imperial City. Thus does Alessia become the first gem in the Cyrodilic Amulet of Kings. The gem is the Red Diamond in the middle of the Amulet. This is the symbol of the &lt;a href=\"Empire\"&gt;Empire&lt;/a&gt; and later taken as the symbol of the &lt;a href=\"Septim%20Dynasty\"&gt;Septim line&lt;/a&gt;. It is surrounded by eight other gems, one for each of the divines.\nSo long as the Empire shall maintain its worship of Akatosh and his kin, and so long as Alessia's heirs shall bear the Amulet of Kings, Akatosh would maintain a barrier between Tamriel and &lt;a href=\"Oblivion%20%28Realm%29\"&gt;Oblivion&lt;/a&gt;, so that mortals need never again fear the devastating hosts of the Daedra Lords. But if the blood of Alessia's heirs should fail, then the barriers between Tamriel and the Daedric realms will fall.\nNorth of Cyrodiil, in the land of &lt;a href=\"Skyrim\"&gt;Skyrim&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"Nords\"&gt;Nords&lt;/a&gt;, lead by &lt;a href=\"King%20Harald\"&gt;King Harald&lt;/a&gt; were having a war against the &lt;a href=\"Snow%20Elves\"&gt;Snow Elves&lt;/a&gt; for power over the land of Skyrim. Harald managed to conquer Snow Elves and completely cleared them out of the land, primarily to Cyrodiil and &lt;a href=\"Morrowind\"&gt;Morrowind&lt;/a&gt;. Many other human slaves attempted to do the same to their Ayleid rulers. The Ayleid Government was fractured due to many city-states and Ayleid controlled lands having civil wars over power. A strong minority of Ayleid nobility even sympathized with the Human cause. Alessia used this period of weakness to the Ayleids as a time to launch her attack in Cyrodiil.\nAround the year 1E 242, Alessia's rebel army finally struck out at their masters. &lt;a href=\"Pelinal%20Whitestrake\"&gt;Pelinal Whitestrake&lt;/a&gt; in particular became legendary for his brutal decimation of the Ayleid army. Alessia herself often had to intercede with the divines on his behalf after \"the Madness\" took him and he committed particularly atrocious acts. The Nordic king to the North wasted little time in joining Alessia's revolt, and the human armies quickly began to drive the Ayleid out of the populated regions of Cyrodiil. The human strategy was to drive the Ayleid inward, towards the White-Gold Tower, forcing the front into increasingly smaller circles around Lake Rumare.\nIt was during this period, late in the war, that the Ayleid king &lt;a href=\"Umaril\"&gt;Umaril&lt;/a&gt; was given control of the Ayleid armies. Umaril, like Pelinal and &lt;a href=\"Morihaus\"&gt;Morihaus&lt;/a&gt;, was of a divine bloodline, having an Ayleid mother and a divine father. As such, he was one of the few able to match Pelinal in battle. To further his advantage, Umaril made a deal with the Daedric Lord &lt;a href=\"Meridia\"&gt;Meridia&lt;/a&gt;, and was granted use of her &lt;a href=\"Auroran\"&gt;Auroran&lt;/a&gt;s as foot soldiers. Pelinal eventually defeated Umaril, but just barely, and Umaril's spirit escaped to Oblivion where he would wait and return centuries later. The remaining Ayleid kings swarmed down on Pelinal's injured body, tore him into eight pieces, and left his head for Alessia and Morihaus to find.\nHowever, even the death of Pelinal couldn't halt the human revolt. After years of fighting, Alessia's army finally took control of the White-Gold Tower itself, forever ending the reign of the Ayleid in Tamriel. Alessia was named the first &lt;a href=\"Empress\"&gt;Empress&lt;/a&gt; in Tamrielic history.\nThe Second Era.\nThe second era is arguably the most violent time Cyrodiil has ever seen. It was a time when Daedra were everywhere, the first necromancers in Tamriel started to surface, and Cyrodiil became the center of a huge war that caused the fall of the Empire.\nDuring the second era, the &lt;a href=\"Imperials\"&gt;Imperials&lt;/a&gt; struck a deal with one of &lt;a href=\"Molag%20Bal\"&gt;Molag Bal's&lt;/a&gt; lieutenants, a necromancer named &lt;a href=\"Mannimarco\"&gt;Mannimarco&lt;/a&gt;:\nThe Imperials would be given a &lt;a href=\"Daedric\"&gt;Daedric&lt;/a&gt; army for them to use in their war efforts. In return, the &lt;a href=\"Emperor\"&gt;Emperor&lt;/a&gt; allowed for Molag Bal to drag Tamriel into his Daedric realm, &lt;a href=\"Coldharbour\"&gt;Coldharbour&lt;/a&gt;. Control over Tamriel would then be given to Mannimarco.\nWith Daedra flooding into Tamriel, and anchors placed by Molag Bal to drag it into his realm, citizens of Tamriel were angry at the Imperials for their betrayal and corrupt behavior. Very quickly, a huge war broke out involving all of the nine provinces of Tamriel. With this, the Empire soon crumbled. The Imperials still had control of the Daedric army and used it as their main source of defense against the angry mobs that poured into Cyrodiil to fight the Imperials as well as each other. There were three alliances going against the Imperials. These factions tried to crown their own emperor/empress and take over Tamriel for their own and stop the Daedra from being able to enter the realm."}

The need to restrict access to one's home has been a problem since homes were first built. The very first security system was a simple bar across the door. This has the obvious shortcoming of only being functional when the owner is at home.\nThe first recorded instance of a lock is the ingenious armbreaker of &lt;a href=\"Anvil%20Castle%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;Castle Anvil&lt;/a&gt;. The count of the day put five slide bars on the side of the door. A hole in the door just above them allowed him to reach in and manipulate any of these bars. Only one of the bars truly locked or unlocked the door. The other four released the clasp on a hammer that fell down on the person's arm. Only by knowing which sliding bar was the true lock could one safely open the door.\nFor over a hundred years, the state of the art in locks was defined by sliding bars and punished traps. Then the famous &lt;a href=\"dwarf\"&gt;dwarf&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Mzunchend\"&gt;Mzunchend&lt;/a&gt; invented the pin lock. The first example had three pins. The key was turned in the lock four times, each turn depending on a different pin being in position. Obviously a pin could be used more than once.\nIt was 65 years before anyone devised a method to open a pin-based lock without the key and without damaging the lock. It wasn't that the problem was so difficult. It was that nobody other than royalty could afford Mzunchend's locks. An enterprising blacksmith named &lt;a href=\"Orenthal\"&gt;Orenthal&lt;/a&gt; decided to mass-produce a common form of the lock at a reasonable price. Suddenly every shop had a lock. Now there was a reason to subvert the locks. It wasn't long before lockpicks and lockpicking appeared. Orenthal became quite wealthly inventing more and more sophisticated locks.\nToday's locks are sophisticated mechanisms with spring-loaded pins. Each metal pin must be pushed up by the key precisely to open the lock. Any imprecision in the key, any poorly made copy, or any clumsy attempt at lockpicking releases the spring tension, causing the pin to clamp down upon or even break the key or lockpick.\nLocks are made more secure by using multiple pins in the lock. Multiple-pin locks are more delicate and difficult to make, and more expensive, but provide a greater reliability against tampering. Multiple-pin locks have the further virtue of resetting all pins when any single pin is tampered with. A single mistake with the fifth pin of a five-pin lock requires a thief to reset all five pins again. Most affordable locks are one-pin or two-pin locks. The five-pin lock is the highest achievement of the lockmaker's craft, and the greatest challenge to a would-be intruder.\nPicking the modern lock is an art form. A lockpick is a thin metal bar with a small tooth on the end. The tooth is used to press the pin up into the lock mechanism. The thief uses skill and experience to manipulate each pin in turn to determine the exact tension necessary to set the spring-loaded pin at its catchpoint. With a subtle pressing and lofting of the pin, the master thief determines the exact motion required to set it.\nA novice thief breaks many picks while learning his trade. Only with time and practice will he get better at guessing the tension and timing necessary to set a pin. As a result, novice thieves tend to carry a great many lockpicks, while the masters only need to carry a few."}

So much has happened to this tiny town in such a short amount of time, and so many lives have been affected by it, I felt it necessary to describe its rich history within these volumes.

I hope that my readers will appreciate the amount of fortitude and perseverance that it must take to endure life in such an inhospitable and untamed land.\nRaven Rock was founded in &lt;a href=\"3E%20427\"&gt;3E 427&lt;/a&gt; by the &lt;a href=\"East%20Empire%20Company\"&gt;East Empire Company&lt;/a&gt; in response to the discovery of a rich &lt;a href=\"Raven%20Rock%20Mine\"&gt;ebony mine&lt;/a&gt; on the southern edge of the island of &lt;a href=\"Solstheim%20%28Dragonborn%29\"&gt;Solstheim&lt;/a&gt;. The construction of the town took several months, and the mine immediately started yielding ebony ore that the miner's shipped to &lt;a href=\"Windhelm%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Windhelm&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Skyrim\"&gt;Skyrim&lt;/a&gt;. By &lt;a href=\"3E%20432\"&gt;3E 432&lt;/a&gt;, the town was home to over thirty people, all of whom depended on the mine for their livelihood. At this time, Raven Rock was almost exclusively inhabited by &lt;a href=\"Imperials%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Imperials&lt;/a&gt; and a few &lt;a href=\"Nords%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Nords&lt;/a&gt; who were drawn to the mine's wealth.\nWhen the &lt;a href=\"Oblivion%20Crisis\"&gt;Oblivion Crisis&lt;/a&gt; arose in &lt;a href=\"3E%20433\"&gt;3E 433&lt;/a&gt;, Raven Rock remained largely untouched by &lt;a href=\"Mehrunes%20Dagon\"&gt;Mehrunes Dagon&lt;/a&gt;'s forces and work continued as usual. The bulk of the &lt;a href=\"Hold%20Guard\"&gt;Imperial Guard&lt;/a&gt; that was stationed in Raven Rock was recalled to &lt;a href=\"Cyrodiil\"&gt;Cyrodiil&lt;/a&gt; to fight the invading forces, but a few soldiers remained behind in order to protect the ebony mine from bandits. It's uncertain whether any Oblivion Gates ever opened on Solstheim, as there appears to be no record of such an event ever occurring there.\nIn the first year of the &lt;a href=\"Fourth%20Era\"&gt;Fourth Era&lt;/a&gt;, after the destruction of &lt;a href=\"Ald%27ruhn\"&gt;Ald'ruhn&lt;/a&gt;, many of the Dunmer &lt;a href=\"Great%20Houses\"&gt;Great Houses&lt;/a&gt; sent out small groups of their own to seek places to reestablish themselves. &lt;a href=\"House%20Redoran\"&gt;House Redoran's&lt;/a&gt; group was led by &lt;a href=\"Brara%20Morvayn\"&gt;Brara Morvayn&lt;/a&gt; who immediately struck out for Solstheim. After some quick negotiations with the East Empire Company (and some speculate quite a bit of coin changing hands), Brara's group was allowed to settle in Raven Rock where they quickly became a part of the mining colony's way of life. The Dunmer proved to be both hard-working and reliable when it came to working in the mines, impressing the East Empire Company and solidifying their relationship.\nAll was going quite well until that fateful day in &lt;a href=\"4E%2005\"&gt;4E 05&lt;/a&gt; when the Red Mountain suddenly erupted, sending a massive blast across the &lt;a href=\"Sea%20of%20Ghosts\"&gt;Sea of Ghosts&lt;/a&gt; that struck Solstheim with its full fury. Raven Rock was heavily damaged by this wave of force, which toppled several of its stone structures and obliterated many of the wooden ones. Ironically, the mine once again proved to be the town's saving grace, as most of the population of Raven Rock was working underground at the time, and was completely shielded from the blast. This event wasn't without cost, however. Raven Rock was heavily dependent on nearby &lt;a href=\"Fort%20Frostmoth%20%28Dragonborn%29\"&gt;Fort Frostmoth&lt;/a&gt; for its defense, but the eruption had almost completely wiped it from the face of Solstheim. The few soldiers that survived took residence in Raven Rock itself and attempted to set up a makeshift garrison there, but these scant few were hardly a match for potential threats to their town. With the East Empire Company's permission, Brara brought in some of house Redoran's elite \"&lt;a href=\"Redoran%20Guard%20%28Dragonborn%29\"&gt;Redoran Guard&lt;/a&gt;\" to fill the void. The guard proved to be an ideal replacement for the fallen Imperial soldiers and have been guarding the town ever since."}

I hope that my readers will appreciate the amount of fortitude and perseverance that it must take to endure life in such an inhospitable and untamed land.\nAfther a few years, the relentless ash storms from the ever-erupting Red Mountain had transformed Solstheim's southern reaches into pure ash wastes reminiscent of those present on &lt;a href=\"Vvardenfell\"&gt;Vvardenfell&lt;/a&gt; itself. The storms would leave behind deep dunes of ash that made life exceedingly difficult in &lt;a href=\"Raven%20Rock%20%28Dragonborn%29\"&gt;Raven Rock&lt;/a&gt;. In order to protect the town from these drifts, &lt;a href=\"Brara%20Morvayn\"&gt;Brara Morvayn&lt;/a&gt; proposed that the &lt;a href=\"East%20Empire%20Company\"&gt;East Empire Company&lt;/a&gt; construct a large wall of her own design to protect the east end of town. The company quickly agreed and provided the necessary funds. After almost a year, the construction was complete and the huge edifice was named \"&lt;a href=\"The%20Bulwark\"&gt;The Bulwark&lt;/a&gt;.\" The wall proved to be extremely effective and allowed work to continue unabated in the mines.\nIn &lt;a href=\"4E%2016\"&gt;4E 16&lt;/a&gt;, when &lt;a href=\"Solstheim%20%28Dragonborn%29\"&gt;Solstheim&lt;/a&gt; was passed into the hands of the Dunmer people, the East Empire Company was forced to relinguish Raven Rock's control to &lt;a href=\"House%20Redoran\"&gt;House Redoran&lt;/a&gt;. The Council quickly named Brara Morvayn as councilor of their new town, and allowed her to rule Solstheim as she saw fit. As a result of this changing of the guard, almost the entire Imperial population left Raven Rock and returned to Cyrodiil. Brara continued to welcome the Dunmer that elected to settle on Solstheim. Some chose to stay in Raven Rock to work in the mines, and other took to more familiar territory and began a nomadic lifestyle in the ash wastes.\nThe next few decades were the golden years for Raven Rock. Brara Morvayn was keeping the peace, the mines were still producing large quantities of ebony and the Dunmer that lived on the island were happy. After almost fifty years of prosperity, in &lt;a href=\"4E%2065\"&gt;4E 65&lt;/a&gt; Brara Morvayn finally succumbed to old age and passed away. She was interred in the family's ancestral tomb and her son, &lt;a href=\"Lleril%20Morvayn\"&gt;Lleril Morvayn&lt;/a&gt;, took her place. The people who had lived in Raven Rock during Brara's time as councilor were pleased to discover that Lleril shared his mother's notions of rulership. He was fair and compassionate, which kept the people on the island quite happy for many decades."}

Fortunately, the attack was unsuccessful thanks to the prowess of the &lt;a href=\"Redoran%20Guard%20%28Dragonborn%29\"&gt;Redoran Guard&lt;/a&gt;. Under questioning by &lt;a href=\"Captain%20Modyn%20Veleth\"&gt;Captain Modyn Veleth&lt;/a&gt;, the assassin was revealed to be &lt;a href=\"Vilur%20Ulen\"&gt;Vilur Ulen&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"House%20Hlaalu\"&gt;House Hlaalu&lt;/a&gt;. House Hlaalu had been at odds with House Redoran for years following their removal from the &lt;a href=\"Council%20of%20Great%20Houses\"&gt;Council of Great Houses&lt;/a&gt;. The Hlaalu believe that House Redoran was instrumental in this reorganization, and have held a grudge ever since. Their attempt on Lleril's life was meant to send a message to the Council that House Redoran was not as mighty as they purported to be and that they were truly vulnerable and weak. The Redoran Guard investigated further and discovered that Vilur had been organizing a coup in Raven Rock in an attempt to fully wrest control of the island from Lleril's grasp. Vilur and his conspirators were executed and the coup was quelled.\nSeveral recent events have served to solidify the Dunmer people's respect for &lt;a href=\"Lleril%20Morvayn\"&gt;Lleril Morvayn&lt;/a&gt;. In &lt;a href=\"4E%20130\"&gt;4E130&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"the%20Bulwark\"&gt;the Bulwark&lt;/a&gt; began to show its age and threatened to crumble. The councilor elected to use the bulk of his personal fortune to have it repaired. In &lt;a href=\"4E%20150\"&gt;4E150&lt;/a&gt;, a small force of &lt;a href=\"Argonians%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Argonians&lt;/a&gt; landed on &lt;a href=\"Solstheim%20%28Dragonborn%29\"&gt;Solstheim&lt;/a&gt; with the intent of wreaking havoc on the island, and Councilor Morvayn led the charge against them personally. And in &lt;a href=\"4E%20170\"&gt;4E170&lt;/a&gt;, when the ebony mine finally began to dry up, he drained the remainder of his coffers keeping the people fed. By &lt;a href=\"4E%20181\"&gt;4E181&lt;/a&gt;, the mine's ebony veins were completely exhausted. Lleril ordered the mine to be shut down, and Raven Rock turned to hunting and fishing for its trade. A few Dunmer families departed Solstheim and returned to the mainland, but most stayed behind.\nAt present, Lleril Morvayn is still ruler of Raven Rock. The Redoran Guard continues to maintain order within the town and the surrounding area, keeping Raven Rock's residents safe, and in line. If even so much as a rumor of dissent reaches Lleril's ears, he has it quashed immediately.

The vassal kingdoms throughout Tamriel had reached a new height of rebellion, openly challenging his rule. They refused his taxes and led sorties against the Imperial garrisons throughout the land. At the destruction of his fortress in &lt;a href=\"Dawnstar\"&gt;Dawnstar&lt;/a&gt;, he gathered the &lt;a href=\"Elder%20Council\"&gt;Imperial Council&lt;/a&gt; in what would be called the &lt;a href=\"Council%20of%20Bardmont\"&gt;Council of Bardmont&lt;/a&gt;, after the town south of Dawnstar where they met. There the Potentate declared catholic and universal martial law. The princes of &lt;a href=\"Tamriel\"&gt;Tamriel&lt;/a&gt; would dissolve their armies or face his wrath.\nThe next thirty-seven years were perhaps the bloodiest in the violent history of Tamriel.\nIn order to crush the last of the royal armies, Versidae-Shaie had to sacrifice many of his best legions, as well as spend nearly every last piece of gold in the Imperial treasury. But he accomplished the unthinkable. For the first time in history, there was but one army in the land, and it was his own.\nThe problems that immediately surfaced were almost as staggering as the triumph itself. The Potentate had impoverished the land by his war, for the vanquished kingdoms had also spent the last of their gold in defense. Farmers and merchants alike had their livelihood ruined. Before the princes of Tamriel would not pay his taxes - now, they could not.\nThe only persons who benefited from the war were criminals, who preyed upon the ruins of the lawless land, without fear of arrest now that all the local guards and militia were gone. It was a crisis the Akavir had seen coming long before he destroyed the last of his subjects' armies, but for which he had no solution. He could not allow his vassals their own armies again, but the land was deeper into the stew of anarchy that it had ever been before. His army sought to fight the rise of crime, but a central authority was no threat against the local underworld.\nIn the dawn of the year &lt;a href=\"2E%20320\"&gt;320&lt;/a&gt;, a kinsman of Versidae-Shaie, &lt;a href=\"Dinieras-Ves\"&gt;Dinieras-Ves&lt;/a&gt; \"the Iron\", presented himself with a host of companions before the Potentate. It was he who suggested an order of mercantile warriors-for-hire, who could be hired by nobility in lieu of a standing army. The employment would be temporary, and a percentage of the fee would go to the Potentate's government, thus putting salve on two of Versidae-Shaie's greatest pains.\nThough it was then called &lt;a href=\"Fighters%20Guild\"&gt;The Syffim&lt;/a&gt;, after the &lt;a href=\"Tsaesci\"&gt;Tsaesci&lt;/a&gt; word for 'soldiers,' the organization that was to be known as the Fighters Guild had been born.\nDinieras-Ves \"the Iron\" initially believed that the entirety of the order should be composed of Akaviri. This belief of his is not disputed by any historian, though his motivation is often debated. The traditional, simple explanation is that he knew his countrymen well, trusted them, and felt that their tradition of fighting for profit would be of use. Others believe, with reason, that he and the Potentate sought to use the order to effectively complete the conquest of Tamriel begun over five hundred years earlier. When Akavir attacked Tamriel in the &lt;a href=\"1E%202703\"&gt;2703rd&lt;/a&gt; year of the &lt;a href=\"First%20Era\"&gt;1st era&lt;/a&gt;, they had been beaten back by the &lt;a href=\"Reman%20Dynasty\"&gt;Reman Dynasty&lt;/a&gt;. Now they had a Potentate on the throne, and with Dinieras-Ves's machinations, the local armies would also be Akaviri. What they had failed to do by combat, they would have successfully accomplished by patience. A traditional strategem, many scholars suggest, of the immortal snake men, the Tsaesci of Akavir, who always had time on their side.\nThe point, however, is largely academic. Though the Syffim did establish themselves in some kingdoms neighboring &lt;a href=\"Cyrodiil\"&gt;Cyrodiil&lt;/a&gt;, it became quickly apparent that local warriors were needed. Part of the problem was simply that there were not enough Akaviri for the work that needed to be done. Another part was that the snake men did not understand the geography and politics of the regions they were assigned.\nIt was evident that some non-Akaviri were needed in the Syffim, and by the midpoint of the year, three &lt;a href=\"Nords\"&gt;Nords&lt;/a&gt;, a warrior-sorceress, a &lt;a href=\"rogue\"&gt;rogue&lt;/a&gt;, and a &lt;a href=\"knight\"&gt;knight&lt;/a&gt; were admitted into the order.\nThe knight, whose name has been lost in the sands of time, was also a great &lt;a href=\"Armorer%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;armorer&lt;/a&gt;, and probably did more to strengthen the organization than anyone but Dinieras-Ves himself. As has often been stated, the Akaviri, particularly the Tsaesci, understood weaponry better than armor. Even if they could not wear it themselves, the knight was able to explain to the other Syffim what the weaknesses were in their opponent's armor, explaining to them how many joints there were in a pauldon and a grieve, and the differences between Aketons and Armkachens, Gorgets and Gliedshrims, Palettes and Pasguards, Tabards and Tassettes.\nWith this knowledge, they made long strides in defeating the brigands, doing far better than their meager numbers would suggest. It is a joke among historians that if Akavir had a Nord armorer in their employ in the first era, they would have won the invasion.\nThe success of these first three outsiders to the Syffim opened the door for more local members. Before the year was through, Dinieras-Ves had spread his business throughout the Empire. Young men and women, for a variety of reasons - because of desperate poverty, for love of action and adventure, in order to aid their crime-stricken neighbors - joined his new order en masse. They received training, and were immediately put to work helping the aristocracy's problems, assuming the roles of guards and soldiers within their locality.\nThe early success of the Syffim in combating crime and defeating local monsters so inspired Potentate Versidae-Shaie that he entertained representatives from other organizations interested in Imperial sanction. Though formed much earlier, the Mages Guild had always been viewed with suspicion by the government. In the &lt;a href=\"2E%20321\"&gt;321st year&lt;/a&gt; of the &lt;a href=\"Second%20Era\"&gt;2nd Era&lt;/a&gt;, the Potentate gave his approval to the &lt;a href=\"Guilds%20Act\"&gt;Guilds Act&lt;/a&gt;, officially sanctioning the &lt;a href=\"Mages%20Guild\"&gt;Mages&lt;/a&gt;, together with the Guilds of Tinkers, Cobblers, Prostitutes, Scribes, Architects, Brewers, Vintners, Weavers, Ratcatchers, Furriers, Cooks, Astrologers, Healers, Tailors, Minstrals, Barristers, and the Syffim. In the charter, they were no longer called the Syffim, however: bowing to the name it had become known as by the people, they were to be called the &lt;a href=\"Fighters%20Guild\"&gt;Fighters Guild&lt;/a&gt;. All the Guilds, and those that followed by later sanctions throughout the second and third eras, would be protected and encouraged by the Empire of &lt;a href=\"Cyrodiil\"&gt;Cyrodiil&lt;/a&gt;, recognizing their value to the people of Tamriel. All would be required to pay to expand their influence throughout the land. The Empire was strengthened by their presence, and the Imperial coffers were filled once again.\nShortly after Versidae-Shaie's death, only three years after the Guild Act, his heir &lt;a href=\"Savirien-Chorak\"&gt;Savirien-Chorak&lt;/a&gt;, allowed the reforming of local armies. The Fighters Guild was no longer the principal arm of the local aristocracy, but their worth had already been established. Though there were certainly strong individuals who sought their own fortunes in the past, many historians have suggested that Dinieras-Ves was the ancestor in spirit of the modern phenomenon of the Adventurer, those men and women who dedicate their lives to questing for fame and fortune.\nThus, all owe a debt of gratitude to the Fighters Guild\u2014not only its members, and the people who have been helped by its neutral policy of offering strong arms for a fee within the boundaries of the law. Without them, there would be no guilds of any kind, and it may be argued, no model for even the independent Adventurer."}

A set of stairs leads down to the southeast to a poison dart trap, where a set of stairs leads further down to the northeast, and another leads up to the southeast. The latter stairs lead to a dead end, with a wooden door that has an apprentice-locked chest behind it. Back at the junction, the stairs to the northeast lead down to an exploding rune trap. Beyond this is a prison with several leveled &lt;a href=\"Vampire%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;vampires&lt;/a&gt; in the cages and a leveled\u00a0&lt;a href=\"Conjurer%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;conjurer&lt;/a&gt;\u00a0sitting at a table.\u00a0The vampires, if released from\u00a0their cages, will attack any enemy mages. Depending on their level at the time of entering the dungeon, the victors could be either of them.\nThrough the wooden door to the southeast is a torture chamber with several enemy magic users and several dead vampires, Khajiit, and Nords on tables or in cages. A door to the northeast leads to stairs down to another prison, where\u00a0Orthorn\u00a0can be found, along with a necromancer, who\u00a0will release the wolves from their cages if given the chance. Orthorn, when asked about the books, says the Caller has them. After this conversation, Orthorn can be released by using the middle of the three levers. He can then be\u00a0a temporary follower for the remainder of quest, or he can be left in the cage until the dungeon is cleared, or told to get out of there, in which case he will retreat all the way back to &lt;a href=\"The%20Frozen%20Hearth\"&gt;The Frozen Hearth&lt;/a&gt; in Winterhold for the remainder of the quest.\nFrom the prison, an adept-locked door to the west leads to a room with an apprentice-locked chest and some weapons on a table. A set of stairs to the northwest leads to a door to\u00a0Fellglow Keep\u00a0that requires a key. A door to the southeast leads to stairs that go down to a room where there are three other magicians practicing their skills. It is recommended you have snowberries and a potion of resist cold. Sneaking here is very effective. Otherwise, the best defense is to attack.\nThe next steps to the northwest lead to a room with several Necromancers and some skeletons. The summoned undead will disappear as soon as all Necromancers are dead, so the Necromancers should be targeted first. At the end of the corridor is a &lt;a href=\"Raise%20Zombie\"&gt;Raise Zombie&lt;/a&gt; spell tome on a pedestal. To the left (northwest) is a door which leads to the main portion of Fellglow Keep.\nFellglow Keep.\nIn the next area, there are a conjurer and a mage. If Orthorn\u00a0is in the party, it is best to attack whomever he chooses. There are bits of treasure throughout the room. Upon the pedestal directly across from the room's entrance is the Conjuration skill book, \"&lt;a href=\"The%20Doors%20of%20Oblivion\"&gt;The Doors of Oblivion&lt;/a&gt;\". Through the door to the east is a dining room, where a Novice Necromancer lies in wait. An adjacent room leads to a hallway with a key-locked door to the north that returns to the dungeons, plus a doorway to the east that leads to a common room with an &lt;a href=\"atronach\"&gt;atronach&lt;/a&gt;\u00a0of some kind, as well as a mage, though at lower levels, it will be a &lt;a href=\"Familiar%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;familiar&lt;/a&gt; instead. The bottom floor also has a key-locked door on the north wall that leads outside, plus a door to the east that leads to a room where a mage and necromancer are resting.\nUp the stairs are open doorways to the right and left, plus a closed door leading forward (south) that is barred from the other side. To the right is a room with an &lt;a href=\"Arcane%20Enchanter%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Arcane Enchanter&lt;/a&gt;, an &lt;a href=\"Alchemy%20Lab%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Alchemy Lab&lt;/a&gt;, an &lt;a href=\"Anvil%20%28Smithing%29\"&gt;anvil&lt;/a&gt; and a &lt;a href=\"workbench\"&gt;workbench&lt;/a&gt;. On the desk next to the alchemy lab is an &lt;a href=\"Unusual%20Gem\"&gt;Unusual Gem&lt;/a&gt;, while on the bookshelf next to the workbench are three\u00a0&lt;a href=\"Quicksilver%20Ingot%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Quicksilver Ingots&lt;/a&gt;.\u00a0Back at the top of the stairs, to the left and up another flight of steps, there is a room with a mage and conjurer inside an inner circle of shelves. The skill book \"&lt;a href=\"A%20Hypothetical%20Treachery\"&gt;A Hypothetical Treachery&lt;/a&gt;\", which boosts destruction skill, is on a table nearby.\nOn the opposite side (south) of the room entrance is a pathway leading to stairs up to another hallway. There are bedrooms on the left wall, and an atronach at the other end of the hall. The second bedroom on the left contains a sleeping mage who holds the Fellglow Keep key. A good strategy, if wanting to keep Orthorn alive until confronting the Caller, is to leave him in his cell until killing the mage with the key, as it will unlock the keep's main entrance and the door that leads directly to the dungeon, providing a shortcut to get back to the Caller's location without having Orthorn be killed by one of the various mages on the way up. Through the door at the other end is an adept-locked door that can be opened with the Keep key. Inside is a shrine of &lt;a href=\"Julianos\"&gt;Julianos&lt;/a&gt;, which\u00a0temporarily\u00a0increases magicka by 25 points for several in-game hours. Another door in that room leads to a room with an adept-locked chest.\nThe Caller.\nBack in the hallway where the atronach was, there is a wooden door leading to a grand staircase, curving west-northwest, to the top. At the top is the door to the &lt;a href=\"Fellglow%20Keep%23Fellglow%20Keep%20Ritual%20Chamber\"&gt;Fellglow Keep ritual chamber&lt;/a&gt;. Inside is\u00a0the Caller. The Dragonborn can either fight against the sorceress or come to an arrangement with her. Note that the game auto-saves at this point, regardless of the settings for auto-saving, before entering the Caller's chamber.\nConclusion.\nIf an arrangement was made, the door behind the Caller cannot be used. In that case, the Dragonborn can just leave through the entrance door. If not previously dealt with, a Novice Storm Mage will be there to fight at the bottom of the stairs. She can be killed, and the Fellglow Keep key will be on her body. After backtracking to\u00a0the room where the Apprentice Ice Mage was,\u00a0the key-locked door to the outside can be used to leave the keep.\nIf a battle was fought, the three books (located on pedestals, but they may fall onto the floor during the fighting) can be taken, and the Fellglow Keep key can be looted from the Caller. The door directly behind the middle pedestal leads to a lot of loot and a trap door exit, which leads through the barred door and back to Skyrim.\nUpon returning to the &lt;a href=\"College%20of%20Winterhold%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;College of Winterhold&lt;/a&gt;, Urag gro-Shub\u00a0can be spoken with to return the books. He will then offer the quest \"&lt;a href=\"Good%20Intentions\"&gt;Good Intentions&lt;/a&gt;.\""}

The &lt;a href=\"Hjaal%20River\"&gt;Hjaal River&lt;/a&gt; runs through a large portion of this Hold. Their coat of arms is of a triskele.\nDescription.\nHjaalmarch is located in northern Skyrim, at the mouth of the &lt;a href=\"Karth%20River\"&gt;Karth River&lt;/a&gt;. The capital, Morthal, lies near the center of the hold. The hold borders &lt;a href=\"Haafingar\"&gt;Haafingar&lt;/a&gt;, separated by the Karth River to the northwest, &lt;a href=\"The%20Reach\"&gt;The Reach&lt;/a&gt; to the west, &lt;a href=\"Whiterun%20Hold\"&gt;Whiterun&lt;/a&gt; to the south and &lt;a href=\"The%20Pale\"&gt;The Pale&lt;/a&gt; to the east. Hjaalmarch's most distinct terrain are its swamps and marshes, but it also has snow-covered forests, mountains, and rocky plains, making it arguably the most geographically diverse of Skyrim's holds.\nSitting on the southern edge of the &lt;a href=\"Drajkmyr%20Marsh\"&gt;Drajkmyr Marsh&lt;/a&gt;, dry ground can be hard to come by in Morthal. The town is often shrouded in a thick fog, and ominous twisted trees grow in the surrounding marsh, which is known to contain vampires. Due to this, Morthal is a foreboding place for travelers, many of whom choose to steer clear of the place altogether.\nMorthal is a town shrouded in mystery. Its people are reclusive and wary of newcomers, and only a single lumber camp supports its weak economy. The Jarl is among the most relaxed in Skyrim when it comes to taxation, but Hjaalmarch is also the poorest of the nine holds. Although the hold is still part of the &lt;a href=\"Empire\"&gt;Empire&lt;/a&gt;, the Jarl is unapologetically vague in her enthusiasm for the Imperial Legate stationed in her dwelling. A number of the people in the town are concerned about the prospect of war, since war brings outsiders, and outsiders are not a welcome sight in Morthal. Most would prefer the conflict be kept outside their home, leaving them free to pursue their own interests."}

There, the &lt;a href=\"Camonna%20Tong%20%28Morrowind%29\"&gt;Camonna Tong&lt;/a&gt; has created a huge hideout for smugglers. The hideout stretches for several miles under the town. While non-smugglers are not exactly welcome, visitors can still receive training and can buy tools for the Thieves Trade. The hideout is also a main base of the moon sugar smuggling operation; from here, &lt;a href=\"Moon%20Sugar%20%28Morrowind%29\"&gt;moon sugar&lt;/a&gt; is stuffed into &lt;a href=\"Khajiit\"&gt;Khajiit&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Slavery\"&gt;slaves&lt;/a&gt; and is sent with a Camonna Tong agent to the buyer.

While it is true that they provided us with much needed labor and resources, and it was certainly advantageous from a fiscal point of view due to their surprisingly (and now suspiciously) low bid for the contract, I have uncovered a number of disquieting consequences as a result of this continuing relationship.\nAs far as the construction of the towns of Suran and Balmora, aside from the garish use of Hlaalu architecture when the contract clearly called for the utilization of a more dignified Redoran design, they did complete the work on time and on budget. However, we inadvertently provided them with a foothold beyond Seyda Neen. This, in turn, has enabled them to establish business relations with all sources of raw materials and provisions throughout Vvardenfell, giving House Hlaalu a near-monopoly in these areas. Much of House Redoran now buys all of its local goods through Hlaalu aggregators!\nMoreover, House Hlaalu continues to expand its influence in both towns, much to the chagrin of our regional councilors. It's clear they have their eyes on these strategic locations, and I fear that they know how to conquer us through business while we instead remain vigilant against more militaristic overtures.\nIn conclusion, I fear that in retrospect, we should never have entered into this deal with House Hlaalu. In the long run, we may have saved time and gold only to have lost the territory we so desperately require.\nManaran Renim, First Clerk of House Affairs, Vvardenfell"}

Three Halls call him Hortator.' When I have been named Hortator by each of the three Great Houses of Vvardenfell, I will have passed the Fourth Trial and should return to Nibani Maesa for further guidance.\"\nWalkthrough.\nThe quest will begin immediately after the completion of the &lt;a href=\"The%20Path%20of%20the%20Incarnate\"&gt;previous quest&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href=\"Nibani%20Maesa\"&gt;Nibani Maesa&lt;/a&gt; indicates that the Nerevarine must obtain the title of Hortator of each of the Three &lt;a href=\"Great%20Houses\"&gt;Great Houses&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"Vvardenfell%20%28Morrowind%29\"&gt;Vvardenfell&lt;/a&gt;. If questioned further, Nibani will also indicate that a Hlaalu councilor can be found in &lt;a href=\"Balmora%20%28Morrowind%29\"&gt;Balmora&lt;/a&gt;.\nAfter questioning the inhabitants of Balmora's &lt;a href=\"Hlaalu%20Council%20Manor\"&gt;Hlaalu Council Manor&lt;/a&gt; and acquiring the \"&lt;a href=\"Yellow%20Book%20of%203E%20426\"&gt;Yellow Book of 3E 426&lt;/a&gt;\", which contains information on all the Hlaalu council members and their location, the Nerevarine will be directed to &lt;a href=\"Crassius%20Curio\"&gt;Crassius Curio&lt;/a&gt;.\nCrassius Curio.\nCrassius can be found in the &lt;a href=\"Curio%20Manor\"&gt;Curio Manor&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;a href=\"Hlaalu%20Canton%20%28Morrowind%29\"&gt;Hlaalu Canton&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Vivec%20City%20%28Morrowind%29\"&gt;Vivec City&lt;/a&gt;. His support is obtained relatively easily if \"&lt;a href=\"The%20Bad%20Actor\"&gt;The Bad Actor&lt;/a&gt;\" quest has been completed. Or, the Nerevarine may bribe him with 1,000 gold (or 500 for members of the House of Hlaalu). An alternative method, provided Curio's disposition towards the Nerevarine is above 70, is to give Curio a kiss, which will raise his disposition and grant his vote for Hortator of Hlaalu. Crassius will also give the Nerevarine advice on how to deal with Orvas Dren, Velanda Omani and Nevena Ules.\nYngling Half-Troll.\n&lt;a href=\"Yngling%20Half-Troll\"&gt;Yngling Half-Troll&lt;/a&gt; can be found in &lt;a href=\"Vivec%2C%20St.%20Olms%20Canton\"&gt;Vivec, St. Olms Canton&lt;/a&gt;, in &lt;a href=\"Yngling%20Manor\"&gt;Yngling Manor&lt;/a&gt; within the &lt;a href=\"St.%20Olms%20Plaza%20%28Morrowind%29\"&gt;St. Olms Plaza&lt;/a&gt;. His vote will cost the Nerevarine 2,000 (or 1,000 for members of Hlaalu), although an alternative route, suggested by other Hlaalu Council members, is to kill him. Doing this will turn all the other Yngling Manor's residents hostile.\nDram Bero.\nTo obtain the vote of &lt;a href=\"Dram%20Bero\"&gt;Dram Bero&lt;/a&gt;, the Nerevarine simply has to speak to him. However, the Nerevarine must find him first. If the Hero questions Vivec City inhabitants, they will be directed to the &lt;a href=\"St.%20Olms%20Haunted%20Manor\"&gt;Haunted Manor&lt;/a&gt; in the St. Olms Canton, where Dram is hidden. He can be found behind two locked doors.\nOrvas Dren.\nAs indicated by Crassius Curio, speaking to &lt;a href=\"Orvas%20Dren\"&gt;Orvas Dren&lt;/a&gt; will help sway &lt;a href=\"Velanda%20Omani\"&gt;Velanda Omani&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Nevena%20Ules\"&gt;Nevena Ules&lt;/a&gt;'s vote in favor of the Nerevarine. This can be done in a number of ways. The most simple of these methods is to simply attack him (a move supported by most of the other Hlaalu Councilors) although this will prompt his bodyguards within the &lt;a href=\"Dren%20Plantation%20%28Morrowind%29\"&gt;Dren Plantation&lt;/a&gt; to attack the Nerevarine. Another method is to suggest that his vote is required to defeat &lt;a href=\"Dagoth%20Ur%20%28Character%29\"&gt;Dagoth Ur&lt;/a&gt;, which will make him hostile. It is also possible to blackmail him by acquiring &lt;a href=\"Dren%27s%20Note\"&gt;Dren's Note&lt;/a&gt;, which is hidden within the locked basement of the Plantation's manor and heavily guarded. If the Nerevarine is a member of &lt;a href=\"House%20Hlaalu%20%28Morrowind%29\"&gt;House Hlaalu&lt;/a&gt; and has become the lead of the &lt;a href=\"Camonna%20Tong%20%28Morrowind%29\"&gt;Camonna Tong&lt;/a&gt;, Dren should fold and, thereafter, use his influence to manipulate Velanda Omani and Nevena Ules.\nVelanda Omanu and Nevena Ules.\nAfter visiting Orvas Dren, &lt;a href=\"Velanda%20Omani\"&gt;Velanda Omani&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Nevena%20Ules\"&gt;Nevena Ules&lt;/a&gt;'s votes can be obtained simply by talking to them. Velanda Omanu can be found within the &lt;a href=\"Omani%20Manor\"&gt;Omani Manor&lt;/a&gt; on &lt;a href=\"Elmas%20Island\"&gt;Elmas Island&lt;/a&gt;, east of the St. Olms Canton. Nevena Ules resides within the &lt;a href=\"Ules%20Manor%20%28Morrowind%29\"&gt;Ules Manor&lt;/a&gt;, in &lt;a href=\"Suran%20%28Morrowind%29\"&gt;Suran&lt;/a&gt;.\nOnce all of the councilors' votes have been obtained the Nerevarine must return to Crassius Curio. Crassius will name Nerevarine Hortator of the Hlaalu House and offer the &lt;a href=\"Belt%20of%20the%20Hortator\"&gt;Belt of the Hortator&lt;/a&gt;."}

My office has received an ever-increasing number of complaints in recent weeks. Many of our House Guests have experienced poor treatment at the hands of House Redoran bailiffs and constables. As you well know, &lt;a href=\"House%20Hlaalu%20%28Online%29\"&gt;House Hlaalu&lt;/a&gt; is duty-bound to address these grievances on their behalf.\nMy dear minster, while I share your belief in the superiority of the &lt;a href=\"Dunmer%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Dunmer&lt;/a&gt; people, we must try to keep such opinions to ourselves. House Hlaalu defers to House Redoran on matters of defense; I would not urge you to defer to us on matters of commerce and diplomacy.\nOur economy is in peril. The &lt;a href=\"Ebonheart%20Pact\"&gt;Pact&lt;/a&gt; has brought us some measure of security, yes, but the cost has been dear. Dearer than I think your Redoran kinsmen are willing to admit. My trade ministers have gone to great lengths to solidify our holdings outside &lt;a href=\"Morrowind%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Morrowind&lt;/a&gt;. While the enemy has seized most of our extraterritorial property, we retain sizable assets in Imperial and foreign business concerns. Extracting this wealth is no small task. It takes time, gold, and most importantly, connections. We can ill-afford to alienate what few friends we have outside the Pact.\nJust this morning I received a complaint from one &lt;a href=\"Theodric%20Ashcroft\"&gt;Theodric Ashcroft&lt;/a&gt;\u2014a respected &lt;a href=\"Bretons%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Breton&lt;/a&gt; investor. Apparently he was accosted by a pair of constables. while inspecting a potential construction site. Some minor religious infraction, I'm told---stepping over a fence to get a better look at property, or something? According to Ashcroft, the constable forced him to the ground, dragged him to the &lt;a href=\"Tribunal%20Temple%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Temple&lt;/a&gt;, and turned him over to the &lt;a href=\"Ordinator%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Ordinators&lt;/a&gt;, who subjected him to no less than three hours of interrogation and corporal reeducation. Needless to say, he will not be investing in our fair city. Both Ashcroft and his gold fled to the mainland.\nThese people may be inferior, their religions may be repugnant, their manners may be tiresome. But for the love of &lt;a href=\"Tribunal%20%28Online%29\"&gt;the Three&lt;/a&gt;, swallow your pride and bear it! Idle zealotry cannot put food on the table. We cannot fill our coffers with incense and prayer and expect to wage &lt;a href=\"Alliance%20War\"&gt;war&lt;/a&gt; effectively. Interprovincial commerce is a necessary evil, whether you like it or not. I urge you in the strongest possible terms\u2014leave outsiders be. I hope this will be my final word on the subject.\nYours most respectfully,\n&lt;a href=\"Tirnur%20Nalyn\"&gt;Tirnur Nalyn&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"House%20Hlaalu%20%28Online%29\"&gt;House Hlaalu&lt;/a&gt; Deputy Trade Viceroy"}

He will say that the Nerevarine needs to improve business near the stronghold by restoring the nearby &lt;a href=\"Shurdan-Raplay%20Egg%20Mine\"&gt;Shurdan-Raplay Egg Mine&lt;/a&gt;, just across the river. The mine can be restored by curing the &lt;a href=\"Kwama%20Queen%20%28Morrowind%29\"&gt;Kwama Queen&lt;/a&gt; and hiring some miners.\nTo cure the queen, simply cast a Cure Blight spell or scroll on her. Getting the &lt;a href=\"Vivec%27s%20Touch\"&gt;Vivec's Touch&lt;/a&gt; spell from the Vivec Ashmask in the Gnisis temple is also an option.\nAs for the miners, talk to Dondos again and he'll suggest recruiting an unemployed miner. That would be either &lt;a href=\"Ilasour%20Tansumiran\"&gt;Ilasour Tansumiran&lt;/a&gt;, found in his cave dwelling home north of the Temple in Gnisis, or &lt;a href=\"Llaals%20Ores\"&gt;Llaals Ores&lt;/a&gt; at the &lt;a href=\"Slave%20Market\"&gt;Slave Market&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"Tel%20Aruhn%20%28Morrowind%29\"&gt;Tel Aruhn&lt;/a&gt;. Llaals is now a slave in the Underground; talk to &lt;a href=\"Savile%20Imayn\"&gt;Savile Imayn&lt;/a&gt; to learn that curing the Kwama Queen is needed to secure his release. Whichever one is chosen, return to Dondos afterwards. Note that neither miner will actually go to the mine.\nUpon curing the Queen and hiring one of the miners, return to Dondos to start the second phase of the stronghold. The Nerevarine should receive another journal entry one week later, when the second phase of construction is complete.\nPhase III.\nOnce the second phase of the stronghold is finished and the Nerevarine has reached the rank of House Father, it is now possible to begin the third and final phase of construction. Return to Balmora and speak with Dondos, who will explain that the Nerevarine needs to get rid of the bandits in the area of the stronghold. To do that the Nerevarine will need to hire a guard, and Dondos suggests speaking with the Balmora &lt;a href=\"Fighters%20Guild%20%28Morrowind%29\"&gt;Fighters Guild&lt;/a&gt; or the &lt;a href=\"Imperial%20Legion%20%28Morrowind%29\"&gt;Imperial Legion&lt;/a&gt; at &lt;a href=\"Moonmoth%20Legion%20Fort\"&gt;Moonmoth Legion Fort&lt;/a&gt; to do so.\nThe fort will have no one to spare, but speaking with &lt;a href=\"Flaenia%20Amiulusus\"&gt;Flaenia Amiulusus&lt;/a&gt; at the Balmora Fighters Guild will get the Hero a guard named &lt;a href=\"Fjorgeir\"&gt;Fjorgeir&lt;/a&gt; for 1000 gold.\nOnce he is hired, travel to the stronghold to meet him and talk to him about the bandits. Apparently the bandits are hiding out in the cave of &lt;a href=\"Zainsipilu%20%28Morrowind%29\"&gt;Zainsipilu&lt;/a&gt;. Kill the leader of the bandits, &lt;a href=\"Maros%20Gimayn\"&gt;Maros Gimayn&lt;/a&gt;. Killing the other seven bandits is optional.\nReturn to Driler to begin the third phase of construction. Another journal entry should be received in three days when the last phase of construction is complete."}

He had three sons and a daughter.\nHleryn made a pact with &lt;a href=\"Clavicus%20Vile\"&gt;Clavicus Vile&lt;/a&gt;. Vile demanded Hleryn to retrieve &lt;a href=\"Umbra\"&gt;Umbra&lt;/a&gt; from the ruins of &lt;a href=\"Vivec%20City%20%28Morrowind%29\"&gt;Vivec City&lt;/a&gt;. Hleryn sent his son &lt;a href=\"Elhul%20Sathil\"&gt;Elhul&lt;/a&gt; to recover the sword, but as soon as he touched the sword he went mad. Elhul killed his mother and his two brothers, as well as half of the guards. They could not separate Umbra from Elhul, so Hleryn ordered to lock Elhul and the sword in the dungeons of the castle.\nEight years later, &lt;a href=\"Attrebus%20Mede\"&gt;Attrebus&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Sul\"&gt;Sul&lt;/a&gt; arrived at &lt;a href=\"Sathil%20%28Village%29\"&gt;Sathil&lt;/a&gt; looking for &lt;a href=\"Umbra\"&gt;Umbra&lt;/a&gt;.

While they were walking through the mountain, they were striken by an unnatural frost storm. Attrebus was pulled away by the storm. After the storm cleared, Hleryn showed up with five of his guards. Although he blamed a &lt;a href=\"Frost%20Giant%20%28Lord%20of%20Souls%29\"&gt;Frost Giant&lt;/a&gt;, Sul suspected that Hleryn was to blame for the storm. Lord Sathil interrogated Sul, he wanted to know who had sent them. He revealed that many had tried to retrieve Umbra, all sent by Clavicus Vile. Since Sul did not admit they were searching for Umbra, Hleryn cast a spell that made every nerve in Sul\u2019s body seem to hum. He seeked to discover who had sent them. He sensed it had been a &lt;a href=\"Daedric%20Prince\"&gt;Daedric Prince&lt;/a&gt;, but not Vile, so he let Sul free. Before returning to his rooms, Hleryn told Sul they could stay as long as they wished."}

One day, her friends disappeared, leaving nothing but traces of struggle behind. She left Skywatch shortly afterwards, becoming a vagrant, but never forgetting her friends. She was worried someone was targeting her as the sole survivor of the group, although she kept an ear to the ground, trying to find leads that would allow her to figure out what happened to her friends. \nEmber is a nickname she uses pretty much exclusively to refer to herself.

Emeric was the founder of the &lt;a href=\"Daggerfall%20Covenant\"&gt;Daggerfall Covenant&lt;/a&gt;, one of the strongest alliances in the province of Tamriel. Emeric is a brilliant individual, well-rounded in trading, speechcraft, and the military. He was also the founder of the &lt;a href=\"Cumberland%20Dynasty\"&gt;Cumberland Dynasty&lt;/a&gt;.\nPersonality.\nEmeric is a cunning and shrewd negotiator, who firmly believes the Covenant is the true heir of the &lt;a href=\"Reman%20Empire\"&gt;Reman Empire&lt;/a&gt;, with the current &lt;a href=\"House%20Tharn\"&gt;Tharn&lt;/a&gt;-led Empire being merely a puppet of Molag Bal and the &lt;a href=\"Worm%20Cult\"&gt;Worm Cult&lt;/a&gt;.\nHe has a dry and sarcastic sense of humor, and can be impatient and rude at times, as evidenced by his comments at the Stirk meeting where he refers to &lt;a href=\"Jorunn\"&gt;Jorunn&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Ayrenn\"&gt;Ayrenn&lt;/a&gt; as \"a snow barbarian and an adolescent female\" to their faces.\nHistory.\n&lt;a href=\"Second%20Era\"&gt;Second Era&lt;/a&gt;.\nEarly Life &amp; the Black Drake's Invasion.\nEmeric of Cumberland was born in the city-state of &lt;a href=\"Wayrest\"&gt;Wayrest&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"2E%20521\"&gt;2E 521&lt;/a&gt;, as the son of &lt;a href=\"Pierric\"&gt;Pierric&lt;/a&gt;. Throughout his childhood, Emeric would be taught in the ways of trade and speechcraft, although, Pierric was not content with Emeric only learning these things. Knowing the ways of the world, Pierric had Emeric train in the art of combat, sparring with the Cumberland Arms Master, spending the summer as a lieutenant for the &lt;a href=\"Evermore\"&gt;Evermore&lt;/a&gt; Caravan, and exercising with the &lt;a href=\"Menevia%20Heavy%20Dragoons\"&gt;Menevia Heavy Dragoons&lt;/a&gt;. By the time he was twenty in &lt;a href=\"2E%20542\"&gt;2E 542&lt;/a&gt;, Emeric was a master warrior and brilliant politician. But at this point, &lt;a href=\"Durcorach%20the%20Black%20Drake\"&gt;Durcorach the Black Drake&lt;/a&gt; would invade the province of High Rock, beginning with &lt;a href=\"Bangkorai\"&gt;Bangkorai&lt;/a&gt;. The region of Bangkorai was captured within a week or so, making Wayrest the next target.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Siege%20of%20Wayrest%20%282E%20542%29\"&gt;Siege of Wayrest&lt;/a&gt; had lasted for fifty-seven days, Emeric had taken part in the defense against Durcorach. Fortunately, the Reachmen Horde did not have &lt;a href=\"siege%20weapons\"&gt;siege weapons&lt;/a&gt; to break down the walls, nor did they have ships to enter the port, so Durcorach was not able to enter Wayrest, deciding to move towards &lt;a href=\"Daggerfall\"&gt;Daggerfall&lt;/a&gt;. Emeric asked &lt;a href=\"King%20Gardner\"&gt;King Gardner&lt;/a&gt; to give him merchant ships so that he could help Daggerfall in the fight against the Reachmen. As &lt;a href=\"Bergamot%20Deleyn\"&gt;Bergamot Deleyn&lt;/a&gt; held the defense against the Reachmen, Emeric advanced towards the Kingdom, cornering the Reachmen as they attacked the city walls. In the end, Earl Emeric had slain Durcorach, ending the Reachmen's invasion. Afterward, the Kingdoms of High Rock had formed the &lt;a href=\"Daggerfall%20Covenant\"&gt;Daggerfall Covenant&lt;/a&gt;, an alliance of Kingdoms, created to defend against foreign threats such as Durcorach.\nEmeric's Ascension to High King &amp; Ranser's Fury.\nThe Kingdom of Wayrest would live in peace, though things would take a turn for the worst with the coming of the &lt;a href=\"Knahaten%20Flu\"&gt;Knahaten Flu&lt;/a&gt;, a deadly disease that killed a large population of Tamriel. In High Rock, there were many notable casualties, including the death of &lt;a href=\"Hurlbert%20Branquette\"&gt;Hurlbert Branquette&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Pierric%20of%20Cumberland\"&gt;Pierric of Cumberland&lt;/a&gt;. King Gardner had also succumbed to the disease, ending the Gardner Dynasty. At the same time, House Cumberland had found a large deposit of &lt;a href=\"Orichalcum\"&gt;Orichalcum&lt;/a&gt; in Stormhaven, which was used to elevate Wayrest's armada and trade, considering this and his efforts in the &lt;a href=\"Black%20Drake%27s%20Invasion\"&gt;Black Drake's Invasion&lt;/a&gt;, Emeric was promoted to the position of King of Wayrest. With that being said, Emeric of Cumberland was named the &lt;a href=\"High%20King\"&gt;High King&lt;/a&gt; of High Rock, and was in need of a wife, to rule by his side. Initially, Emeric chose &lt;a href=\"Rayelle\"&gt;Rayelle&lt;/a&gt;, Princess of &lt;a href=\"Shornhelm\"&gt;Shornhelm&lt;/a&gt;, but instead opted for &lt;a href=\"Maraya\"&gt;Maraya&lt;/a&gt;, the Princess of &lt;a href=\"Sentinel\"&gt;Sentinel&lt;/a&gt;. This was done to establish relations with &lt;a href=\"King%20Fahara%27jad\"&gt;King Fahara'jad&lt;/a&gt; and the province of &lt;a href=\"Hammerfell\"&gt;Hammerfell&lt;/a&gt;. This had enraged &lt;a href=\"King%20Ranser\"&gt;King Ranser&lt;/a&gt;, the leader of Shornhelm, to the point of preparing for war. He was furious to the point where he did not show to Emeric's wedding in &lt;a href=\"2E%20566\"&gt;2E 566&lt;/a&gt;. After this would begin &lt;a href=\"King%20Ranser%27s%20War\"&gt;King Ranser's War&lt;/a&gt;, a civil war between the Daggerfall Covenant and the Kingdom of &lt;a href=\"Rivenspire\"&gt;Rivenspire&lt;/a&gt;.\nKing Ranser's War &amp; the Greater Daggerfall Covenant.\nKing Ranser's War had begun with the &lt;a href=\"Siege%20of%20Wayrest%20%282E%20566%29\"&gt;Siege of Wayrest&lt;/a&gt;, which occurred sometime after the wedding. High King Emeric had led the defense against Ranser's forces, wielding his Orichalc longsword, the &lt;a href=\"Orichalc%20Scalpel\"&gt;Orichalc Scalpel&lt;/a&gt;. Emeric and his Cumberland Guard were able to push back the &lt;a href=\"Oldgate%20Lancers\"&gt;Oldgate Lancers&lt;/a&gt; and Ranser's armada, all the way back to Rivenspire. Sometime before this, Emeric had met &lt;a href=\"Kurog%20gro-Bagrakh\"&gt;Kurog gro-Bagrakh&lt;/a&gt;, an &lt;a href=\"Orc\"&gt;Orc&lt;/a&gt;ish mercenary that originally hailed from &lt;a href=\"Wrothgar\"&gt;Wrothgar&lt;/a&gt;. Both Kurog and Emeric met under the circumstances of &lt;a href=\"Zephrine%20Frey\"&gt;Zephrine Frey&lt;/a&gt;, a Breton Chronicler of Wayrest that works for Emeric. Both warriors were bonding with each other rather well, essentially becoming best friends afterward. After their meeting, Kurog had become the leader of his clan, and sought to re-establish &lt;a href=\"Yashnag%27s%20Chiefdom\"&gt;Yashnag's Chiefdom&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Falkreath%20Hold\"&gt;Falkreath Hold&lt;/a&gt;, but this plan would fall apart. When Emeric was dealing with Ranser's forces in Rivenspire, he had sent Frey to deliver a message to Kurog, to which he received in &lt;a href=\"Dragonstar\"&gt;Dragonstar&lt;/a&gt;. If Kurog helped Emeric defeat Ranser's forces in &lt;a href=\"Markwasten%20Moor\"&gt;Markwasten Moor&lt;/a&gt;, then he would offer &lt;a href=\"Orsinium\"&gt;new land&lt;/a&gt; in Wrothgar, and so Kurog and his Orcish brigade defeated Ranser. What came out of this was the Greater Daggerfall Covenant, with the Bretons of High Rock, the &lt;a href=\"Redguards\"&gt;Redguards&lt;/a&gt; of Hammerfell, and the Orcs of &lt;a href=\"Orsinium\"&gt;Orsinium&lt;/a&gt;. This Greater Covenant would join the fray known as the &lt;a href=\"Alliance%20War\"&gt;Alliance War&lt;/a&gt;, with the hopes of re-establishing the Empires of Tamriel and overthrowing the Empress Regent, &lt;a href=\"Clivia%20Tharn\"&gt;Clivia Tharn&lt;/a&gt;.\nNightmares in Stormhaven; Vaermina's Gambit.\nDuring the &lt;a href=\"Interregnum\"&gt;Interregnum&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"2E%20582\"&gt;2E 582&lt;/a&gt;, High King Emeric and High Queen Maraya lived in Wayrest, overwatching the Daggerfall Covenant from within their lands. Around this time, &lt;a href=\"Stormhaven\"&gt;Stormhaven&lt;/a&gt; has been undergoing a crisis where various groups such as the &lt;a href=\"Supernal%20Dreamers\"&gt;Supernal Dreamers&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Midnight%20Union\"&gt;Midnight Union&lt;/a&gt; were running amok in the region. The &lt;a href=\"Dream%20Shard\"&gt;Dream Shard&lt;/a&gt; from the &lt;a href=\"Pariah%20Abbey\"&gt;Pariah Abbey&lt;/a&gt; had been stolen by the Midnight Union and was reported to King Emeric, who guided an &lt;a href=\"Vestige\"&gt;Agent&lt;/a&gt; of the Covenant to the &lt;a href=\"At-Tura%20Estate\"&gt;At-Tura Estate&lt;/a&gt; along the &lt;a href=\"Menevia\"&gt;Menevia&lt;/a&gt; coast. Eventually, the Dreamer's plot at the Estate was stopped, and the Dream Shard was retrieved. Emeric was once again informed about an impending threat to &lt;a href=\"Gavaudon\"&gt;Gavaudon&lt;/a&gt;, to which it was dealt with by the Agent. The &lt;a href=\"Daedric%20Prince\"&gt;Daedric Prince&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Vaermina\"&gt;Vaermina&lt;/a&gt; had attempted to destroy the Daggerfall Covenant, by possessing various figures throughout Stormhaven. She had corrupted the shrine of &lt;a href=\"Azura\"&gt;Azura&lt;/a&gt; in Gavaudon and infested Emeric's dreams, sending him in a twisted form of Wayrest in the realms of &lt;a href=\"Quagmire\"&gt;Quagmire&lt;/a&gt;. The &lt;a href=\"Galthis\"&gt;Night Terror&lt;/a&gt; had taken control of his mind but is defeated by the Agent, saving both the King and the Covenant.\nThe Rivenspire Situation &amp; Barony Wylon Montclair.\nSometime later, High King Emeric and his entourage had traveled to the city-state of &lt;a href=\"Shornhelm\"&gt;Shornhelm&lt;/a&gt;, attempting to aid the Kingdom with the situation against &lt;a href=\"Wylon%20Montclair\"&gt;Wylon Montclair&lt;/a&gt;. When the Daggerfall Covenant reclaimed Shornhelm, Emeric arrived into &lt;a href=\"Castle%20Shornhelm\"&gt;Castle Shornhelm&lt;/a&gt;, convening with &lt;a href=\"Countess%20Eselde%20Tamrith\"&gt;Countess Eselde Tamrith&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Baron%20Alard%20Dorell\"&gt;Baron Alard Dorell&lt;/a&gt; on the situation, aiding the fight from there. Knowing about Wylon's history, Emeric tasked the Agent of the Covenant with finding &lt;a href=\"Count%20Verandis%20Ravenwatch\"&gt;Count Verandis Ravenwatch&lt;/a&gt; deep within the &lt;a href=\"Eyebright%20Feld\"&gt;Eyebright Feld&lt;/a&gt;. From there, the two would deal with &lt;a href=\"House%20Montclair\"&gt;House Montclair&lt;/a&gt; and uncover the way to destroy the &lt;a href=\"Lightless%20Remnant\"&gt;Lightless Remnant&lt;/a&gt; from atop of &lt;a href=\"the%20Doomcrag\"&gt;the Doomcrag&lt;/a&gt;. With Wylon Montclair dead and Verandis Ravenwatch passing away, a new leader was needed to rule over Rivenspire, a new leader since King Ranser. Emeric convened with the Agent and was ultimately able to choose a new leader, being either Eselde Tamrith or Alard Dorell. It is unknown who claimed the throne of Rivenspire, but the region was safe, and Emeric returned to Wayrest, where he continued to govern over the Daggerfall Covenant. But as this was going, Magus-General &lt;a href=\"Septima%20Tharn\"&gt;Septima Tharn&lt;/a&gt; had invaded the realms of the &lt;a href=\"Dragontail%20Mountains\"&gt;Dragontail Mountains&lt;/a&gt;, slaying &lt;a href=\"King%20Eamond%20Guimard\"&gt;King Eamond Guimard&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"Evermore\"&gt;Evermore&lt;/a&gt;, the husband of Emeric's niece, &lt;a href=\"Arzhela%20of%20Cumberland\"&gt;Arzhela of Cumberland&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe Conquest over Bangkorai; Septima Tharn's Tirade.\nWith the &lt;a href=\"Reachmen\"&gt;Reachmen&lt;/a&gt; threat dealt with in Northern Bangkorai, the Kingdom of Evermore had begun to retake Bangkorai from Septima Tharn and the &lt;a href=\"Seventh%20Legion\"&gt;Seventh Legion&lt;/a&gt;. High King Emeric and his &lt;a href=\"Lion%20Guard\"&gt;Lion Guard&lt;/a&gt; take a position on the outskirts of the &lt;a href=\"Bangkorai%20Garrison\"&gt;Bangkorai Garrison&lt;/a&gt;, in the wilds of &lt;a href=\"Ephesus\"&gt;Ephesus&lt;/a&gt;. The Agent was once again utilized to infiltrate the Garrison, to open the northern gates for Emeric and his forces. The battle for the Garrison had begun, as the Agent delved in the Garrison, defeating the summoned &lt;a href=\"Daedra\"&gt;Daedra&lt;/a&gt;. Because of &lt;a href=\"Clivia%20Tharn\"&gt;Clivia Tharn&lt;/a&gt;'s allegiance with &lt;a href=\"Molag%20Bal\"&gt;Molag Bal&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"Daedric%20Prince\"&gt;Daedric Prince&lt;/a&gt; himself had appeared before the Agent. He brought about a &lt;a href=\"Dark%20Anchor\"&gt;Dark Anchor&lt;/a&gt; on the courtyard, having the &lt;a href=\"Xivilai\"&gt;Xivilai&lt;/a&gt; Daedra Lord, &lt;a href=\"Moath\"&gt;Moath&lt;/a&gt; led the defense. Fortunately, the Xivilai was banished, and the Covenant reclaimed the Bangkorai Garrison, paving the way to Southern Bangkorai, eventually retaking &lt;a href=\"Hallin%27s%20Stand\"&gt;Hallin's Stand&lt;/a&gt;. Septima's forces moved south to the &lt;a href=\"Hall%20of%20Heroes\"&gt;Hall of Heroes&lt;/a&gt;, to which the Covenant followed suit, being able to corner them. As the Covenant moved forth in the Hall of Heroes, Septima Tharn kidnapped Emeric and took him to the Chamber of Passage, where she killed him, sending him to the &lt;a href=\"Far%20Shores\"&gt;Far Shores&lt;/a&gt;, the Redguard afterlife. Septima followed him into the realm of &lt;a href=\"Aetherius\"&gt;Aetherius&lt;/a&gt;, attempting to destroy him once and for all. Fortunately, she was killed by the Agent, ending her tirade. &lt;a href=\"Tu%27whacca\"&gt;Tu'whacca&lt;/a&gt; himself, had brought both the Agent and Emeric back to Nirn, where Emeric was revived. The battle was finally over and Emeric continued his rule at Wayrest.\nA Message across Tamriel &amp; Afterwards.\nAfter the events in Bangkorai, &lt;a href=\"Vanus%20Galerion\"&gt;Vanus Galerion&lt;/a&gt; of the &lt;a href=\"Mages%20Guild\"&gt;Mages Guild&lt;/a&gt;, in association with the &lt;a href=\"Ring%20of%20Daggers\"&gt;Ring of Daggers&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Fighters%20Guild\"&gt;Fighters Guild&lt;/a&gt;, sought the Alliance leaders to meet, regarding the &lt;a href=\"Planemeld\"&gt;Planemeld&lt;/a&gt; that is affected the continent. High King Emeric and Galerion convened, and so the Alliance leaders, including &lt;a href=\"Queen%20Ayrenn\"&gt;Queen Ayrenn&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Jorunn%20the%20Skald-King\"&gt;Jorunn the Skald-King&lt;/a&gt;, met at the old ruins on &lt;a href=\"Stirk\"&gt;Stirk&lt;/a&gt;. At first, all three disagree with each other until the meeting was abrupted by Molag Bal, who summoned his Daedra to kill them. Fortunately, the leaders were saved and had given their blessing to allow the Guilds to invade &lt;a href=\"Coldharbour\"&gt;Coldharbour&lt;/a&gt;. With the Planemeld threat over, the Alliance War continued to rage on, with Emeric operating the Covenant from Wayrest. A year later in &lt;a href=\"2E%20583\"&gt;2E 583&lt;/a&gt;, Kurog gro-Orsinium was assassinated for attempting to control the Orcish Clans of Wrothgar unjustly. The new leader, &lt;a href=\"Bazrag%20gro-Fharun\"&gt;Bazrag gro-Fharun&lt;/a&gt; was willing to accept further negotiation with Emeric, but it is unknown whether it happened or not.\nLegacy.\nThe history surrounding Emeric of Cumberland after 2E 582 is unknown, but he paved the way for a new era of prosperity for the Kingdom of Wayrest. Emeric was the first in-line for the &lt;a href=\"Cumberland%20Dynasty\"&gt;Cumberland Dynasty&lt;/a&gt; that ruled over Wayrest. Considering Emeric's age, he had likely passed away a few years since he was killed in Bangkorai, with his son of likely Breton-Redguard descent assuming the throne of Wayrest and likely the Daggerfall Covenant. Eventually, the Cumberland Dynasty was killed off for unknown reasons. Being replaced by the &lt;a href=\"Horley%20Dynasty\"&gt;Horley Dynasty&lt;/a&gt;, who would then be replaced by a line from the &lt;a href=\"Septim%20Dynasty\"&gt;Septim Dynasty&lt;/a&gt;, beginning with &lt;a href=\"Magnus%20Septim\"&gt;Magnus Septim&lt;/a&gt;. By the time the &lt;a href=\"Tiber%20Wars\"&gt;Tiber Wars&lt;/a&gt; had occurred, Emeric's Daggerfall Covenant was over, likely through internal strife, since the &lt;a href=\"Second%20Orsinium\"&gt;Second Orsinium&lt;/a&gt; was sacked by then and both High Rock and Hammerfell had little to no relation with each other. While Emeric's legacy of the Covenant had failed, to an extent, his legacy in Wayrest would last forever."}

It has also been applied to the rulers of the &lt;a href=\"Ysgramor%20Dynasty\"&gt;Ysgramor Dynasty&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"Reman%20Dynasty\"&gt;Reman Dynasty&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"Septim%20Dynasty\"&gt;Septim Dynasty&lt;/a&gt;, and the &lt;a href=\"Mede%20Dynasty\"&gt;Mede Dynasty&lt;/a&gt; as well as the rulers of an independent &lt;a href=\"Cyrodiil\"&gt;Cyrodiil&lt;/a&gt; during the &lt;a href=\"Interregnum\"&gt;Interregnum&lt;/a&gt;. The Emperor is the Head of State for the entire Empire. The Emperor resides in the &lt;a href=\"Imperial%20Palace\"&gt;Imperial Palace&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;a href=\"Imperial%20City\"&gt;Imperial City&lt;/a&gt;. With the title inherited through blood by the first-born male child of the current emperor, the title has been bestowed upon daughters and dowagers. Until the reign of &lt;a href=\"Tiber%20Septim\"&gt;Tiber Septim&lt;/a&gt;, the title was passed through lineage. With no surviving heirs, Septim was granted the title due to his war prowess. After the death of the last-known Septim heir at the end of the &lt;a href=\"Oblivion%20Crisis\"&gt;Oblivion Crisis&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Martin%20Septim\"&gt;Martin Septim&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"Elder%20Council\"&gt;Elder Council&lt;/a&gt; struggled to declare an emperor, until &lt;a href=\"Titus%20Mede%20I\"&gt;Titus Mede I&lt;/a&gt; seized the &lt;a href=\"Ruby%20Throne\"&gt;Ruby Throne&lt;/a&gt;; thus began the &lt;a href=\"Mede%20Dynasty\"&gt;Mede Dynasty&lt;/a&gt;.\nSince the rule of &lt;a href=\"Slavery\"&gt;Slave-Queen&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Alessia\"&gt;Alessia&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"Amulet%20of%20Kings\"&gt;Amulet of Kings&lt;/a&gt; has traditionally been a symbol of the Emperor's power, with the &lt;a href=\"Aedric\"&gt;Aedric&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Aedric%20Artifacts\"&gt;relic&lt;/a&gt; being the means by which the ceremonial &lt;a href=\"Dragonfires\"&gt;Dragonfires&lt;/a&gt; were lit within &lt;a href=\"Temple%20of%20the%20One\"&gt;Temple of the One&lt;/a&gt;, at the Emperor's seat of power, the &lt;a href=\"Imperial%20City\"&gt;Imperial City&lt;/a&gt;. This tradition has been abandoned since during the &lt;a href=\"Oblivion%20Crisis\"&gt;Oblivion Crisis&lt;/a&gt; the Amulet of Kings was shattered and the Dragonfires were lit permanently.\nAscension.\nEmperors ascend to the throne through bloodlines. The title is usually handed from father to son, upon the death of the former. The title has been handed to dowagers of Emperors, most notably &lt;a href=\"Katariah\"&gt;Katariah&lt;/a&gt;. In the absence of an heir, the &lt;a href=\"Empires\"&gt;Empires&lt;/a&gt; successions were different, during the time of the &lt;a href=\"Second%20Empire\"&gt;Second Empire&lt;/a&gt; the &lt;a href=\"Akaviri%20Potentate\"&gt;Akaviri Potentate&lt;/a&gt; ruled in the Emperors stead. During the &lt;a href=\"Third%20Empire\"&gt;Third Empire&lt;/a&gt; the &lt;a href=\"Elder%20Council\"&gt;Elder Council&lt;/a&gt; elected a &lt;a href=\"Potentate\"&gt;Potentate&lt;/a&gt; to rule in the Emperor's place until a suitable alternative can be crowned.\nThe Amulet of Kings.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Amulet%20of%20Kings\"&gt;Amulet of Kings&lt;/a&gt; is the Crown Jewel of the Emperors of &lt;a href=\"Tamriel\"&gt;Tamriel&lt;/a&gt;.\nWhen &lt;a href=\"Alessia\"&gt;Saint Alessia&lt;/a&gt; rallied the slaves against the &lt;a href=\"Ayleid\"&gt;Ayleid&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"Akatosh\"&gt;Akatosh&lt;/a&gt; bestowed upon her the gem that would later be faceted into the &lt;a href=\"Amulet%20of%20Kings\"&gt;Amulet of Kings&lt;/a&gt;. The jewel later became crucial in the crowning of &lt;a href=\"Cyrodiil\"&gt;Cyrodilic&lt;/a&gt; Emperors.\nDuring the Septim Dynasty, newly crowned Emperors brought the amulet to the &lt;a href=\"Temple%20of%20the%20One\"&gt;Temple of the One&lt;/a&gt; to light the &lt;a href=\"Dragonfires\"&gt;Dragonfires&lt;/a&gt; and keep the barrier between &lt;a href=\"Tamriel\"&gt;Tamriel&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Oblivion%20%28Realm%29\"&gt;Oblivion&lt;/a&gt; shut. &lt;a href=\"Martin%20Septim\"&gt;Martin Septim&lt;/a&gt;, an illegitimate heir, broke the tradition when he destroyed the amulet to invoke Akatosh and return &lt;a href=\"Mehrunes%20Dagon\"&gt;Mehrunes Dagon&lt;/a&gt; to Oblivion, thus sealing the barrier between Oblivion and Tamriel forever.\nHistory.\nYsgramor Dynasty.\nThe origins of the first Empire of the &lt;a href=\"Nords\"&gt;Nords&lt;/a&gt; date back to the late &lt;a href=\"Merethic%20Era\"&gt;Merethic Era&lt;/a&gt; when &lt;a href=\"Ysgramor\"&gt;Ysgramor&lt;/a&gt; and his sons escaped the slaughter of the first human city of &lt;a href=\"Saarthal\"&gt;Saarthal&lt;/a&gt; by the native &lt;a href=\"Mer\"&gt;elves&lt;/a&gt;. He returned to Skyrim with an army known as the &lt;a href=\"Five%20Hundred%20Companions\"&gt;Five Hundred Companions&lt;/a&gt; and lead a reprisal campaign against the elven population.The city of Saarthal was retaken and eventually rebuilt. Ysgramor then ordered the construction of &lt;a href=\"Windhelm\"&gt;Windhelm&lt;/a&gt; which would serve as the capital of the Empire.\nIn the following years, Ysgramor and his army hunted the remaining elves to near extinction. Once &lt;a href=\"Skyrim\"&gt;Skyrim&lt;/a&gt; had been purged of &lt;a href=\"Snow%20Elf\"&gt;Snow Elves&lt;/a&gt;, the ancient Nords turned their attention to &lt;a href=\"Solstheim\"&gt;Solstheim&lt;/a&gt; where a great number of skirmishes were said to have taken place.\nAlessian Empire.\nThe first &lt;a href=\"Imperial\"&gt;Imperial&lt;/a&gt; Empire of &lt;a href=\"Tamriel\"&gt;Tamriel&lt;/a&gt; began with Queen Alessia. The Alessian Empire often called the \"First Empire,\" was founded by Alessia after the overthrow of the &lt;a href=\"Ayleid\"&gt;Ayleid&lt;/a&gt; by the human &lt;a href=\"Slavery\"&gt;slaves&lt;/a&gt; in Cyrodiil. Outside of historical writings, the term more specifically refers to the Empire as it exists since the unification of Tamriel under &lt;a href=\"Tiber%20Septim\"&gt;Tiber Septim&lt;/a&gt;, Emperor of Cyrodiil at the end of the &lt;a href=\"Second%20Era\"&gt;Second Era&lt;/a&gt;.\nReman Empire.\nThe birth of the &lt;a href=\"Reman%20Empire\"&gt;Reman Empire&lt;/a&gt; is shrouded in myth. It is believed that in the first Interregnum, many lords and warlords fought for the throne, while others searched and prayed to &lt;a href=\"Saint\"&gt;Saint&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Alessia\"&gt;Alessia&lt;/a&gt; for the return of the peace brought with the first empire. &lt;a href=\"Hrol\"&gt;Hrol&lt;/a&gt;, king of what is now known as &lt;a href=\"Old%20Hroldan\"&gt;Old Hroldan&lt;/a&gt;, specifically went searching for the spirit of Alessia. He had a vision of her standing with &lt;a href=\"Akatosh\"&gt;Akatosh&lt;/a&gt;, and was seduced by the spirit of Alessia. According to one of his shieldthanes, he \"did love unto a hillock\" in the belief it was Alessia.\nNine months later, the Hill birthed &lt;a href=\"Reman%20Cyrodiil\"&gt;Reman Cyrodiil&lt;/a&gt;, who even as an infant spoke with the voice of an Adult. He marched into The Imperial City and was proclaimed a divine emperor. Reman managed to unite the Empire's claims of Skyrim, &lt;a href=\"High%20Rock\"&gt;High Rock&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Hammerfell\"&gt;Hammerfell&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Niben%20Bay\"&gt;Nibenay&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Colovia\"&gt;Colovia&lt;/a&gt; by repelling &lt;a href=\"Akaviri\"&gt;Akaviri&lt;/a&gt; invaders at &lt;a href=\"Pale%20Pass\"&gt;Pale Pass&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href=\"Elsweyr\"&gt;Elsweyr&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Valenwood\"&gt;Valenwood&lt;/a&gt; were taken militarily in the next decade or so. &lt;a href=\"Morrowind\"&gt;Morrowind&lt;/a&gt; never joined the Empire because, as the war between them was concluding, &lt;a href=\"Reman%20Cyrodiil%20III\"&gt;Reman Cyrodiil III&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Juilek%20Cyrodiil\"&gt;his son&lt;/a&gt; were both &lt;a href=\"assassin\"&gt;assassin&lt;/a&gt;ated by the &lt;a href=\"Morag%20Tong\"&gt;Morag Tong&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe Reman Empire fell twice. First it fell at its peak, with the assassination of all Reman Cyrodiil's heirs. This led to the slow decline of the empire under the Akaviri &lt;a href=\"potentate\"&gt;potentate&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Versidue%20Shaie\"&gt;Versidue Shaie&lt;/a&gt;, a &lt;a href=\"Tsaesci\"&gt;Tsaesci&lt;/a&gt;, who ruled for 430 years and established the Fighters Guild and the Guild's act. in &lt;a href=\"2E%20324\"&gt;2E 324&lt;/a&gt;, the potentate was assassinated by the &lt;a href=\"Morag%20Tong\"&gt;Morag Tong&lt;/a&gt; and his son, &lt;a href=\"Savirien%20Chorak\"&gt;Savirien Chorak&lt;/a&gt;, took power. The new potentate swiftly illegalized all &lt;a href=\"Dark%20Brotherhood\"&gt;Morag Tong&lt;/a&gt; operations, in fear of suffering the same fate as his predecessor and father. This eventually led to the formation of the Dark Brotherhood, which, ironically, was responsible for the assassination of the Potentate and all his heirs in the years to come, thus ending the empire.\nSeptim Empire.\nA series of non-noteworthy Emperors would follow over the next four hundred years, until the rise to prominence of the &lt;a href=\"Imperial%20Legion\"&gt;Imperial General&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Tiber%20Septim\"&gt;Talos Stormcrown&lt;/a&gt;, also known as Tiber Septim. Septim commanded the army and navy of Cyrodiil through a number of victories or stalemates, slowly bringing the independent states of Tamriel under the umbrella of Imperial Provinces. &lt;a href=\"Talos\"&gt;Talos&lt;/a&gt;' own emperor was assassinated in &lt;a href=\"2E%20854\"&gt;2E 854&lt;/a&gt;, leaving the Elder Council in charge of the government and, effectively, putting Tiber Septim in charge of the Empire. He continued to press his attacks across Tamriel, until in &lt;a href=\"2E%20896\"&gt;2E 896&lt;/a&gt;, he enacts a truce between Cyrodiil and Morrowind to bring the Dunmer province into the Empire as a mostly independent province, in return for the aid of the golem &lt;a href=\"Numidium\"&gt;Numidium&lt;/a&gt; in defeating the rest of the continent. Talos succeeds, and is named Emperor Tiber Septim, beginning both the Third Era and the Third Empire, the Septim Empire.\nDuring his time as Emperor, Tiber Septim had an affair with a &lt;a href=\"Dunmer\"&gt;Dunmer&lt;/a&gt;i queen named &lt;a href=\"Barenziah\"&gt;Barenziah&lt;/a&gt;. Outraged by the pregnancy, he ordered the child aborted. Barenziah fled the province.\nThe first few in the line of Septim Emperors ruled with relative peace and prosperity, but within 50 years, mismanagement and political infighting become the norm. In more than one case, wars are fought over the throne, including the notable War of the Red Diamond, fought among three surviving heirs. Potential kings or queens frequently attack the sitting Emperor, or have him assassinated, and the Empire begins to lose its grip on several provinces. It would not be until the reign of &lt;a href=\"Uriel%20Septim%20V\"&gt;Uriel Septim V&lt;/a&gt; that the lands of Tamriel were reconquered and the Empire returned to its place of power. Unfortunately, Uriel V also chose to launch an ill-planned invasion of Akavir, in which he was defeated soundly and killed.\nThe next generations of Septim rule restored the peace, prosperity, and most importantly, the stability of the Imperial line to Cyrodiil. By the time of &lt;a href=\"Pelagius%20IV\"&gt;Pelagius IV&lt;/a&gt; and his son, &lt;a href=\"Uriel%20VII\"&gt;Uriel VII&lt;/a&gt;, the Empire was back almost to the height of its power.\nUriel VII's reign was overall a stable one, but was dotted with occasional strife and near-catastrophe. His &lt;a href=\"Imperial%20Battlemage\"&gt;Imperial Battlemage&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Jagar%20Tharn\"&gt;Jagar Tharn&lt;/a&gt;, possibly at the urging of &lt;a href=\"Mehrunes%20Dagon\"&gt;Mehrunes Dagon&lt;/a&gt;, imprisoned him and ruled in his stead for several years. The Emperor escaped just in time to thwart an attempt by the King of &lt;a href=\"Wayrest\"&gt;Wayrest&lt;/a&gt; to conquer &lt;a href=\"Daggerfall\"&gt;Daggerfall&lt;/a&gt;. By the time of the &lt;a href=\"Dagoth%20Ur%20%28Character%29\"&gt;Dagoth Ur&lt;/a&gt; crisis in Morrowind, there was talk of the failing health of the Emperor, and concerns over the future of the Empire.\nAs it turned out, the Emperor's health was not an issue, but he was assassinated trying to flee the Imperial City after learning of the murder of every known heir to the throne. Their murderers, a cult called the &lt;a href=\"Mythic%20Dawn\"&gt;Mythic Dawn&lt;/a&gt;, serving Mehrunes Dagon, were preparing Tamriel for an invasion by the &lt;a href=\"Daedric%20Lord\"&gt;Daedric Lord&lt;/a&gt;. Septim's one remaining illegitimate son &lt;a href=\"Martin%20Septim\"&gt;Martin&lt;/a&gt; eventually led a defense of the Empire by becoming an avatar of Akatosh and defeating Dagon, but died in the process.\nThe Empire was left without an heir once more, but this time, with no one even distantly related to Tiber Septim available to be crowned. The Elder Council, which had essentially ruled during the periods of the weakest emperors, was now officially running the Empire. Many provinces floated rumors of dissolving the Empire; after the &lt;a href=\"Oblivion%20Crisis\"&gt;Oblivion Crisis&lt;/a&gt; many provinces left the empire like &lt;a href=\"Black%20Marsh\"&gt;Black Marsh&lt;/a&gt;.\nAfter the death of the last Septim and the subsequent beginning of the Fourth Era, the &lt;a href=\"Elder%20Council\"&gt;Elder Council&lt;/a&gt; struggled to maintain peace in Cyrodiil, placing new Emperors on the throne\u2014none of which were well-taken by the people of the Empire. Eventually a Colovian warlord named &lt;a href=\"Titus%20Mede%20I\"&gt;Titus Mede&lt;/a&gt; conquered the &lt;a href=\"Imperial%20City\"&gt;Imperial City&lt;/a&gt; with just a thousand men and crowned himself Emperor. Thus began the Mede Dynasty.\nThe succession following the death of &lt;a href=\"Titus%20Mede%20II\"&gt;Titus Mede II&lt;/a&gt; is unclear, but the oath of allegiance sworn by new Imperial legionnaires continues to refer to \"emperor\" and not 'empress.'\nList of Known Emperors.\nThe following is a list of Emperors known to have ruled The &lt;a href=\"Empire%20of%20Tamriel\"&gt;Empire of Tamriel&lt;/a&gt; and their respective reigns."}

In &lt;a href=\"2E%20533\"&gt;2E 533&lt;/a&gt;, Durcorach invaded Cyordiil, eventually capturing the &lt;a href=\"Imperial%20City\"&gt;Imperial City&lt;/a&gt; and with it, the &lt;a href=\"Ruby%20Throne\"&gt;Ruby Throne&lt;/a&gt;. Durcorach proclaimed himself the new &lt;a href=\"Emperor\"&gt;Emperor&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"Cyrodiil\"&gt;Cyrodiil&lt;/a&gt;. Along with Cyrodiil, the &lt;a href=\"Reach\"&gt;Reach&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Markarth%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Markarth&lt;/a&gt; became part of the empire. In an attempt to legitimize his claim and bring himself closer to power, Durcorach married &lt;a href=\"Veraxia%20Tharn\"&gt;Veraxia Tharn&lt;/a&gt; of the prominent &lt;a href=\"Tharn%20family\"&gt;Tharn family&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"Nibenay\"&gt;Nibenay&lt;/a&gt;. Through this, Durcorach created a short lived dynasty known as the &lt;a href=\"Longhouse%20Emperors\"&gt;Longhouse Emperors&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe Longhouse Emperors were generally disliked by the populace because of their barbaric and alien practices. Because of the Reachman's worship of the &lt;a href=\"Daedra\"&gt;Daedra&lt;/a&gt;, many feared that a purge of the &lt;a href=\"Nine%20Divines\"&gt;Eight Divines&lt;/a&gt; was imminent. However, Durcorach didn't interfere with any of the Divines. In &lt;a href=\"2E%20541\"&gt;2E 541&lt;/a&gt;, after roughly eight years of rule, Durcorach launched an invasion of &lt;a href=\"High%20Rock%20%28Online%29\"&gt;High Rock&lt;/a&gt;. Despite initial successes, the invasion would end in utter failure, with the death of Durcorach at the hands of &lt;a href=\"High%20King%20Emeric%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Emeric&lt;/a&gt;. Durcorach's son, &lt;a href=\"Moricar\"&gt;Moricar&lt;/a&gt;, succeeded him after his death. Moricar ruled in a generally peaceful time, before passing on the empire to his son, &lt;a href=\"Emperor%20Leovic\"&gt;Leovic&lt;/a&gt;.\nColovian Revolt.\nLeovic would serve as the last Longhouse Emperor. Leovic's early rule would be generally peaceful, visiting &lt;a href=\"Anvil%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Anvil&lt;/a&gt; during the summers and commissioning \"&lt;a href=\"The%20%28Improved%29%20Emperor%27s%20Guide%20to%20Tamriel\"&gt;The Emperor's Guide to Tamriel&lt;/a&gt;\" in &lt;a href=\"2E%20573\"&gt;2E 573&lt;/a&gt;. However, in &lt;a href=\"2E%20576\"&gt;2E 576&lt;/a&gt; Leovic enraged the populace after legalizing Daedra worship. &lt;a href=\"Varen%20Aquilarios\"&gt;Varen Aquilarios&lt;/a&gt;, who previously had shown loyalty to him, led a large scale revolt known as the Colovian Revolt or &lt;a href=\"Varen%27s%20Rebellion\"&gt;Varen's Rebellion&lt;/a&gt;. Varen scoured a number of victories, leading to more people joining his cause and losing faith in Leovic. In &lt;a href=\"2E%20577\"&gt;2E 577&lt;/a&gt;, Varen invaded the &lt;a href=\"Imperial%20City\"&gt;Imperial City&lt;/a&gt; and killed Leovic in the Imperial Throne Room, ending the Longhouse Emperors. Varen then declared himself Emperor and married Leovic's widow, &lt;a href=\"Clivia%20Tharn\"&gt;Clivia Tharn&lt;/a&gt;.\nAge of Varen, Soulburst, and Aftermath.\nVaren's rule as emperor went generally without problems. However, Varen was constantly concerned that he was an illegitimate ruler because he was not &lt;a href=\"Dragonborn%20%28Lore%29\"&gt;Dragonborn&lt;/a&gt;. To this end, in &lt;a href=\"2E%20577\"&gt;2E 577&lt;/a&gt; he created the &lt;a href=\"Five%20Companions\"&gt;Five Companions&lt;/a&gt; to find the long lost &lt;a href=\"Amulet%20of%20Kings\"&gt;Amulet of Kings&lt;/a&gt; after the &lt;a href=\"Altmer\"&gt;Altmer&lt;/a&gt; sorcerer &lt;a href=\"Mannimarco\"&gt;Mannimarco&lt;/a&gt; convinced the emperor that he knew of a ritual to allow Varen to become Dragonborn. After a two year quest, the Five Companions found the Amulet of Kings, and in &lt;a href=\"2E%20579\"&gt;2E 579&lt;/a&gt; started the ritual in the &lt;a href=\"Temple%20of%20the%20One\"&gt;Temple of the One&lt;/a&gt;. Mannimarco, however, revealed his true intentions. The ritual did not light the dragonfires, but in fact did the exact opposite, shattering the barriers shielding Mundus from Oblivion. This became known as the &lt;a href=\"Soulburst\"&gt;Soulburst&lt;/a&gt;, and after the Soulburst the Emperor disappeared. \nAfter Emperor Varen's disappearance, his wife &lt;a href=\"Clivia%20Tharn\"&gt;Clivia Tharn&lt;/a&gt; assumed the throne as Empress Regent, ruling until &lt;a href=\"2E%20582\"&gt;2E 582&lt;/a&gt;. It was assumed that Clivia was killed in the &lt;a href=\"Planemeld\"&gt;Planemeld&lt;/a&gt; by the &lt;a href=\"Dark%20Anchors\"&gt;Dark Anchors&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href=\"Molag%20Kena\"&gt;Molag Kena&lt;/a&gt; impersonated Clivia in order to obtain an Elder Scroll, but is unknown whether the real Clivia survived the attack or not.

It is the ideal combined state of conflict between two opposing forces that are so similar that they could change their roles and not even know it, and so require an external force to force a resolution. The Enantimorph, in its most basic form, is the schism between the terms \"Is,\" and \"Is not\"; it began when the &lt;a href=\"Void\"&gt;Void&lt;/a&gt;, absolute non-existence, was split by \"&lt;a href=\"AE\"&gt;AE&lt;/a&gt;\" (\"Is\" in &lt;a href=\"Ehlnofex\"&gt;Ehlnofex&lt;/a&gt;), the state of being, and from this, all Enantiomorphs are subgradients. This \"first Enantiomorph\" is echoed through the formation of &lt;a href=\"Anu\"&gt;Anu&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Padomay\"&gt;Padomay&lt;/a&gt;, and other concepts, such as Light and Dark, Good and Evil, Bird and Serpent, Order and Chaos, and so on. The Enantiomorph can be utilized for divine ascension and is sometimes seen as the Fourth Walking Way.\nRoles in the Enantiomorph.\nThe Combatants.\nWhile intrinsically a state of duality, the Enantiomorph has varying other concepts and symbolic influences involved which can even involve mortal interactions, starting with some form of conflict between two individuals who are vying to become a &lt;a href=\"Ruling%20King\"&gt;Ruling King&lt;/a&gt; and must defeat any who can be considered \"their equivalent.\" For instance, in the \"&lt;a href=\"36%20Lessons%20of%20Vivec\"&gt;36 Lessons of Vivec&lt;/a&gt;\", when referring to the &lt;a href=\"Nerevarine\"&gt;Nerevarine&lt;/a&gt;'s main quest to defeat &lt;a href=\"Dagoth%20Ur%20%28Character%29\"&gt;Dagoth Ur&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Vivec\"&gt;Vivec&lt;/a&gt; assigns to both of them the number \"one,\" and to their conflict, conjoining those two numbers to make \"eleven,\" \"The Number of the Master\". Vivec uses this symbolism to explain the consequences of the clashing between Dagoth and the Nerevarine. When both individuals are \"one\" and their conflict is \"eleven,\" how are they supposed to be able to tell which \"one\" they are in the \"eleven\" (i.e., they are unable to determine their own roles in the fight)? When \"one\" and \"one\" are added together, when \"eleven\" collapses, they make \"two,\" which is the number Vivec assigns to the \"Enantiomorph\". Other sources seem to imply that an Enantiomorph must be accompanied by a requisite betrayal. While this is the most common representation of an Enantiomorph, the \"conflict\" can be interpreted in varying other manners, such as a mother and father birthing an offspring.\nThe Observer.\nIn order for the dilemma between the combatants to end and for the Enantiomorph to have \"a winner,\" there must be an observer watching over the battle who determines who is who in the Enantiomorph. Vivec takes this role in the battle between Dagoth Ur and the Nerevarine. In most cases, the observer is blinded or is maimed, which results with the final decision in the Enantiomorph.\nThe Catalyst.\nThe Catalyst, while not fully understood, is possibly a new creation birthed through the convergences of an Enantiomorph. What is known about this role is that it can bring about both the beginning and/or an ending to an Enantiomorph. The best example of such a role is the creation of the deity, Nir, who was formed by the interplay of Anu's light and Padomay's darkness. It is likely that the person who takes the role of the catalyst is a metaphorical representation of the Enantiomorph itself.\nApotheosis.\nIt is stated that the Enantiomorph has been used in attempts to reach the final sub-gradient of all &lt;a href=\"AE\"&gt;AE&lt;/a&gt;. While it is implied this state cannot be reached through the Enantiomorph, the Enantiomorph can be utilized to reach apotheosis in some manner. The God &lt;a href=\"Talos\"&gt;Talos&lt;/a&gt; was said to have been formed through some process related to the Enantiomorph in which the three individuals, &lt;a href=\"Hjalti%20Early-Beard\"&gt;Hjalti Early-Beard&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Zurin%20Arctus\"&gt;Zurin Arctus&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Ysmir%20Wulfharth\"&gt;Ysmir Wulfharth&lt;/a&gt;, amalgamated into one triumvirate whole. This new soul created by the three's merging was identical enough to Lorkhan that they managed to mantle his vacant position in the divine pantheon.\nMantling.\nA good instance of the Enantiomorph being utilized to take the mantle of a divine entity would be the &lt;a href=\"Greymarch\"&gt;Greymarch&lt;/a&gt;. The Greymarch itself is a prime example of an Enantiomorph, given the schizophrenic conflict between &lt;a href=\"Sheogorath\"&gt;Sheogorath&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Jyggalag\"&gt;Jyggalag&lt;/a&gt;, Madness and Order, who are both, for all intents and purposes, the same being. In the battle, Sheogorath is transformed into Jyggalag, and the &lt;a href=\"Hero%20of%20Kvatch\"&gt;Hero of Kvatch&lt;/a&gt; takes Sheogorath's role of defending the Isles, and, in doing so, he inherits the divine role of Sheogorath himself."}

{"id": "6288", "revid": "25646820", "url": "https://elderscrolls.fandom.com/wiki?curid=6288", "title": "Enchant (Morrowind)", "text": "Enchant is a &lt;a href=\"Skills%20%28Morrowind%29\"&gt;skill&lt;/a&gt; in that determines the &lt;a href=\"Nerevarine\"&gt;Nerevarine&lt;/a&gt;'s effectiveness at enchanting items. Enchanting is the ability to add magical effects towards an item. The better your Enchant skill, the more successful you will be at creating magic items, and your ability to use enchanted items improves; for example, skilled enchanters drain power from magic items more slowly than lesser skilled enchanters. Enchant is governed by the &lt;a href=\"Intelligence%20%28Morrowind%29\"&gt;Intelligence&lt;/a&gt;\u00a0attribute, but the success of actual enchanting depends on a number of variables including the &lt;a href=\"Skills%20%28Morrowind%29\"&gt;Enchant Skill&lt;/a&gt;, Intelligence and &lt;a href=\"Luck%20%28Morrowind%29\"&gt;Luck&lt;/a&gt; of the enchanter, the number of enchant points, and whether the enchantments are of constant effect or not. The skills and characteristics raise the chance of success and the enchant points and the use of constant effect lowers it.\nCharacter Creation.\nCertain &lt;a href=\"Races%20%28Morrowind%29\"&gt;races&lt;/a&gt; receive a permanent bonus to this skill upon &lt;a href=\"Character%20Creation%20%28Morrowind%29\"&gt;character creation&lt;/a&gt;:\nHow to enchant.\nThe following classes of items may be enchanted:\nprovided that the item has a positive enchanting capacity and in the case of books is marked as scroll in the . These scrolls look like either a flat piece of paper or a rolled up scroll. Thus, \"&lt;a href=\"Saint%20Nerevar\"&gt;Saint Nerevar&lt;/a&gt;\" is enchantable (looks like a piece of paper) but \"&lt;a href=\"Aedra%20and%20Daedra\"&gt;Aedra and Daedra&lt;/a&gt;\" is not because even though the latter has a positive enchanting capacity, it is not a scroll, but a book. Unlike and , different objects of the same type can have different enchanting capacities and thus hold different types and magnitudes of enchantments. For example, a &lt;a href=\"Chitin%20Helm\"&gt;Chitin Helm&lt;/a&gt; has a capacity of 125, whereas an &lt;a href=\"Indoril%20Helmet\"&gt;Indoril Helmet&lt;/a&gt; has a capacity of 225. This capacity provides another limit to enchanting objects besides the size of the soul used and the enchanting skill and characteristics of the enchanter. A full list of items and their capacities is listed in &lt;a href=\"Enchantable%20Items\"&gt;Enchantable Items&lt;/a&gt;.\nThere are multiple ways of enchanting items. The first way is very simple. You can either go to the &lt;a href=\"Mages%20Guild%20%28Morrowind%29\"&gt;Mages Guild&lt;/a&gt; or an &lt;a href=\"enchanter\"&gt;enchanter&lt;/a&gt;. Once you find them, ask them if you can use an enchantment on the selected item. Remember that these enchantments are not free. Depending on the enchantment they will charge a specific amount of &lt;a href=\"Septim%20%28Coin%29\"&gt;gold&lt;/a&gt; for the item. Note that paying for enchanting services is very expensive.\nThe second way of enchanting an item is a bit more challenging than buying enchantments. This is where your enchantment skill becomes a factor in determining success or failure. All you need is a &lt;a href=\"Soul%20Gem%20%28Morrowind%29\"&gt;soul gem&lt;/a&gt;, and you do not need gold for the enchantment. This method is much harder than paying and it is nearly impossible to place powerful enchantments on items without fortifying one's Intelligence attribute and Enchant skill.\nAs with &lt;a href=\"Spellmaking%20%28Morrowind%29\"&gt;Spellmaking&lt;/a&gt;, the player must choose the Range, Duration and Magnitude of the effect. To put a constant effect enchantment (infinite duration), a &lt;a href=\"soul\"&gt;soul&lt;/a&gt; level of 400 is needed which is only found from &lt;a href=\"Golden%20Saint%20%28Morrowind%29\"&gt;Golden Saints&lt;/a&gt;,\u00a0&lt;a href=\"Ascended%20Sleeper%20%28Morrowind%29\"&gt;Ascended Sleepers&lt;/a&gt; (only generic ones, not the named &lt;a href=\"Dagoths\"&gt;Dagoths&lt;/a&gt;),\u00a0&lt;a href=\"Dahrk%20Mezalf%20%28Character%29\"&gt;Dahrk Mezalf&lt;/a&gt;\u00a0(a unique\u00a0&lt;a href=\"Dwarven%20Spectre\"&gt;Dwarven Spectre&lt;/a&gt;\u00a0in\u00a0&lt;a href=\"Bthungthumz\"&gt;Bthungthumz&lt;/a&gt;), and the &lt;a href=\"Tribunal\"&gt;Tribunal&lt;/a&gt; gods,\u00a0&lt;a href=\"Vivec\"&gt;Vivec&lt;/a&gt;\u00a0and\u00a0&lt;a href=\"Almalexia%20%28Tribunal%29\"&gt;Almalexia&lt;/a&gt;. Vivec's and Almalexia's souls should not be used as their extra charge will be wasted.\nSome care should be taken with constant summon effects to only activate them when needed, as the game may crash if the Nerevarine gets too far away from the summoned creature and then deactivates the item or dies."}

Sadly, some of the nuances of this skill were lost when the &lt;a href=\"Imperial%20City\"&gt;Imperial City&lt;/a&gt; was sacked. Yet we are not without capability. This text will cover only the basics of Enchanting. It is but a primer for students of the &lt;a href=\"College%20of%20Winterhold%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;College of Winterhold&lt;/a&gt;.\nBefore a weapon or a bit of armor can be enchanted, the wizard must first learn the enchantment. This is a personal task. Enchantments cannot easily be passed from one mage to another. They must be understood at a primal level that can only be achieved by destroying an enchanted item and absorbing its nature.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Arcane%20Enchanter%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Arcane Enchanter&lt;/a&gt; is specifically designed for this task. Merely place an enchanted item in the device and will it to relent. The magic will flow into the mage, imbuing him with the knowledge of how the enchantment is formed. The utter destruction of the enchanted item is the unavoidable consequence of this process.\nItems that already have enchantments cannot be enchanted further, so choose carefully when you enchant a blade or helmet. Before beginning an enchantment, make sure you have a filled &lt;a href=\"Soul%20Gem%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;soul gem&lt;/a&gt;. The enchantment will use this soul as a source of power. Place the item and the soul gem on the Arcane Enchanter. Concentrate on the enchantment. The device will meld the two together, enchanting your weapon or armor.\nArmor enchantments are permanent and do not need to be charged or powered. The reasons for this are not known. Some in the College have postulated that wearer contributes small amounts of his own energy to keep the armor enchanted. Others say it is just the will of Magnus that it works that way. Regardless of the reason, enchanted armor and clothing never wear out.\nWeapon enchantments are a different story. They slowly use the soul energy in them until they are depleted. The enchantment remains, but a filled soul gem must be used to recharge the weapon. Perhaps it is the destructive nature of the weapon enchantments that makes it deplete. One intriguing theory is that the soul leaks out a little at a time into the victim that the weapon harms. As a novice enchanter, the reason is immaterial.\nAt first you will find that your enchantments require a lot of soul energy. As you become more skilled, you can achieve the same effect with less and less soul energy. So practice your lessons and pay heed to your masters in this magical arts."}

Potency, Essence, and Aspect Runes are combined to create a glyph which can in turn add enchantments to items. He tells you to acquire three runes, one each of Jora, Oko, and Ta, and mentions a convenient cache outside of town. If you already have the required runes, it is still useful to take advantage of the highlighted search area to gather more runes for later use. The contents of runestone nodes are random, so it may be necessary to search other locations. Jora runes can also be purchased from an Enchanter's shop. \nAfter obtaining the required runes, return to Danel Telleno, who has moved to the city's Enchanting Table. He instructs you to craft a glyph from the Jora, Oko, and Ta runes. Show the completed Trifling Glyph of Health to Danel Telleno, who allows you to keep it and certifies you to fulfill &lt;a href=\"Enchanter%20Writ\"&gt;Enchanter Writ&lt;/a&gt;s. "}

The Rourken Clan is well-known for self-exiling themselves from the province of &lt;a href=\"Morrowind\"&gt;Morrowind&lt;/a&gt; and paving a way for a Dwarven expansion beyond Morrowind.\nHistory.\n&lt;a href=\"First%20Era\"&gt;First Era&lt;/a&gt;.\nWith the formation of the &lt;a href=\"First%20Council\"&gt;First Council&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"1E%20416\"&gt;1E 416&lt;/a&gt;, the Rourken Clan of Dwarves self-exiled themselves from the province of &lt;a href=\"Morrowind\"&gt;Morrowind&lt;/a&gt; when they disagreed with the deal. According to legends, their leader had thrown the mighty hammer known as &lt;a href=\"Volendrung\"&gt;Volendrung&lt;/a&gt; to the west, landing in an area in the modern-day &lt;a href=\"Fiefdom%20of%20Tigonus\"&gt;Fiefdom of Tigonus&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Hammerfell\"&gt;Hammerfell&lt;/a&gt;. After traversing the green forests of &lt;a href=\"Cyrodiil\"&gt;Cyrodiil&lt;/a&gt;, the Rourken Clan arrived into Hammerfell in &lt;a href=\"1E%20420\"&gt;1E 420&lt;/a&gt; and established their first city-state of &lt;a href=\"Volenfell\"&gt;Volenfell&lt;/a&gt;, which would later lend its name to the province. As time went on, the Rourken Clan explored the Hammerfell, beyond the &lt;a href=\"Alik%27r%20Desert\"&gt;Alik'r Desert&lt;/a&gt; and even into the &lt;a href=\"Abecean%20Sea\"&gt;Abecean Sea&lt;/a&gt;. The Rourken Clan created several settlements including &lt;a href=\"Santaki\"&gt;Santaki&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Bthzark\"&gt;Bthzark&lt;/a&gt;. At one point, the Rourken Clan had waged war with &lt;a href=\"Shalidor\"&gt;Shalidor&lt;/a&gt;, a well-known wizard from Skyrim. The &lt;a href=\"Battle%20of%20Rourken-Shalidor\"&gt;Battle of Rourken-Shalidor&lt;/a&gt; was the first recorded instance where the &lt;a href=\"Spell%20Breaker\"&gt;Spell Breaker&lt;/a&gt; was used in battle. When the &lt;a href=\"Battle%20of%20Red%20Mountain\"&gt;Battle of Red Mountain&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"1E%20700\"&gt;1E 700&lt;/a&gt; had erupted, the Rourken Clan did not help the Dwarves under the reign of &lt;a href=\"King%20Dumac\"&gt;King Dumac&lt;/a&gt; but disappeared like the rest of the Dwemer. It was when their immortality was taken away by &lt;a href=\"Kagrenac%27s%20Tools\"&gt;Kagrenac's Tools&lt;/a&gt; by the hands of &lt;a href=\"Indoril%20Nerevar\"&gt;Indoril Nerevar&lt;/a&gt;. The Dwarven cities of Hammerfell were abandoned and left to raid when the &lt;a href=\"Akaviri\"&gt;Akaviri&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Nord\"&gt;Nord&lt;/a&gt;ic pirates of the Abecean Sea attacked them after their disappearances.\nLegacy.\nThe Rourken Clan was not the only Dwarven clan that migrated to the west beyond Morrowind. The Rourken Clan had paved a way for the &lt;a href=\"Kragen%20Clan\"&gt;Kragen Clan&lt;/a&gt; of Dwarves to migrate to the west. The Kragen Clan had left Morrowind and entered &lt;a href=\"the%20Reach\"&gt;the Reach&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Skyrim\"&gt;Skyrim&lt;/a&gt;, establishing the city-state of &lt;a href=\"Arkngthamz\"&gt;Arkngthamz&lt;/a&gt; with the intent of mining &lt;a href=\"Aetherium\"&gt;Aetherium&lt;/a&gt;, a powerful element with magical properties. The success of Arkngthamz had inspired other Dwarven Clans to migrate into Skyrim and eventually, the Kragen Dwarves of Arkngthamz created an alliance with four major cities, which includes &lt;a href=\"Mzulft\"&gt;Mzulft&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Raldbthar\"&gt;Raldbthar&lt;/a&gt;. Sometime later, the Kragen Clan continued west into the &lt;a href=\"Dragon%27s%20Teeth%20Mountains\"&gt;Dragon's Teeth Mountains&lt;/a&gt; and built the illustrious mining city called &lt;a href=\"Arkngthamz-Phng\"&gt;Arkngthamz-Phng&lt;/a&gt;, which was even more successful than Arkngthamz, until they were driven out by &lt;a href=\"Thurvokun\"&gt;Thurvokun&lt;/a&gt;, an ancient &lt;a href=\"Dragons%20%28Lore%29\"&gt;Dragon&lt;/a&gt;."}
