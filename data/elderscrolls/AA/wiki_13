It is the heartlands of Dunmeri civilization, making up the southern portion of the mainland portion of Morrowind. The city-state of &lt;a href=\"Mournhold\"&gt;Mournhold&lt;/a&gt; is the traditional capital of the province, and it is situated here, amidst &lt;a href=\"Lake%20Amaya\"&gt;Lake Amaya&lt;/a&gt;.\nDescription.\nGeography.\n&lt;a href=\"Lagomere\"&gt;Lagomere&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe Lagomere region is where the central hills of Deshaan are located; it is the home of the House Indoril Capital of &lt;a href=\"Mournhold\"&gt;Mournhold&lt;/a&gt;, situated in the middle of &lt;a href=\"Lake%20Amaya\"&gt;Lake Amaya&lt;/a&gt;. Mountains surround Lagomere throughout the north and west, the roads to the south and east lead to marshlands. Eastern Lagomere is called the &lt;a href=\"Vale%20of%20the%20Ghost%20Snake\"&gt;Vale of the Ghost Snake&lt;/a&gt;, named after an entity that the &lt;a href=\"Ashlander\"&gt;Ashlander&lt;/a&gt;s of the area worship. Lake Amaya continues northeast, towards the &lt;a href=\"Padomaic%20Ocean\"&gt;Padomaic Ocean&lt;/a&gt;. Along the river is the &lt;a href=\"Shad%20Astula%20Academy\"&gt;Shad Astula Academy&lt;/a&gt;, which is just before the waterfall, only accessible throughout the boatswain in Mournhold Great Bazaar District.\n&lt;a href=\"Redolent%20Loam\"&gt;Redolent Loam&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe Redolent Loam is the western basin of Deshaan; it is the home of the House Hlaalu Capital of &lt;a href=\"Narsis\"&gt;Narsis&lt;/a&gt;, situated south of &lt;a href=\"Lake%20Hlaalu\"&gt;Lake Hlaalu&lt;/a&gt;. The region houses various settlements that are mainly located around Lake Hlaalu and the eastern river. The lake is surrounded by hills leading into the mountains surrounding the area. The northeastern loam is where the &lt;a href=\"Obsidian%20Gorge\"&gt;Obsidian Gorge&lt;/a&gt; is located, a mountain pass connecting Narsis to Mournhold and it is where several merchants settle, considering the convenient location. The township of &lt;a href=\"Serkamora\"&gt;Serkamora&lt;/a&gt; serves as a gateway to the &lt;a href=\"Stonefalls\"&gt;Stonefalls&lt;/a&gt; region in the north.\n&lt;a href=\"Siltreen\"&gt;Siltreen&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe Siltreen grazelands are the home of Deshaan's agriculture, with farms throughout the river and the Padomaic Coast. The most notable settlement in the land is &lt;a href=\"Tal%27Deic%20Fortress\"&gt;Tal'Deic Fortress&lt;/a&gt;, a stronghold under the occupation of the Great House Redoran. The only other township worth noting is &lt;a href=\"Selfora\"&gt;Selfora&lt;/a&gt;, along the road in between the Vale of the Ghost Snake and Tal'Deic. The &lt;a href=\"Shrine%20of%20Saint%20Veloth\"&gt;Shrine of Saint Veloth&lt;/a&gt; is situated north of Tal'Deic and it not only houses various relics to &lt;a href=\"Saint%20Veloth\"&gt;Saint Veloth&lt;/a&gt;, but it is Veloth's burial grounds. This makes the ruins an extremely holy site in Morrowind. Northeast of the Shrine is &lt;a href=\"Eidolon%27s%20Hollow\"&gt;Eidolon's Hollow&lt;/a&gt;, an ancient ruin filled with Daedra.\nFauna.\nKagouties.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Kagouti\"&gt;Kagouti&lt;/a&gt; is a large bipedal predator that is common throughout the province of Morrowind and other areas throughout Tamriel. These creatures are formidable prey with thick skin and sharp tusk, perfect for ramming various defenses. The Kagouti is a part of a family of bipedal reptiles that live throughout Tropical and Volcanic climates in Tamriel, similar to the &lt;a href=\"Guar\"&gt;Guar&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Alit\"&gt;Alit&lt;/a&gt;. The Hide of a Kagouti is extremely tough, with ridged plating and solid flesh. These creatures tend to be found alone in the wilderness, or at least with one other Kagouti, the only time when Kagouties gather, are during mating season, which is known to be really loud and aggressive. Once it is over, the Kagouti becomes way more territorial, prompting travelers to avoid them as soon as possible.\nPlague Husk.\nA disease is an uncommon thing throughout Tamriel, though it is prevalent throughout Morrowind, depending on the climate. When the Llodos Plague had afflicted Deshaan, victims would have to undergo a harsh transformation, turning them into a &lt;a href=\"Plague%20Husk\"&gt;Plague Husk&lt;/a&gt;. Even after the plague had dispelled, remnants of the Husk had appeared throughout Deshaan, as seen with the &lt;a href=\"Grove%20of%20the%20Abomination\"&gt;Grove of the Abomination&lt;/a&gt;. Victims would have their flesh rot and burn; their Dunmeri skin turns into a brownish-green. These Plague Husks are essentially Zombies, with mindless strength and vomiting at great amounts. Throughout their body are boils of green ooze, that once it is defeated, it accumulates into an explosion of puss and internal juice. Those that are caught in the explosion may succumb to the disease and turn into a Plague Husk. To avoid the Plague Husk is to be covered in the Plague Husk Scent, which smells utterly rancid.\nNetches.\nThe Netch is a mollusk-type creature that is commonly found throughout the province of Morrowind and even areas in &lt;a href=\"Coldharbour%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Coldharbour&lt;/a&gt;. These creatures tend to be found along the coast and waterways of Morrowind, so the Netch is prevalent in places such as Siltreen or the Thir River. There are three variations of the Netch. The Bull Netch is the alpha-male and the largest of the three. They defend their family from invaders and is in charge of hunting. The Betty Netch is the female adult, and the Netch Calf is the youngest. The Netch Leather and Jelly are used for various activities. The former is used to make armor, specifically &lt;a href=\"Medium%20Armor\"&gt;Medium Armor&lt;/a&gt; while the Netch Jelly is used in Alchemy for paralysis poison. As a defense mechanism, the Netch excretes a poisonous gas and whips an opponent with their long, spiky tentacles. Overall, the Netch is rather poisonous, cooked Netch meat is not meant to be consumed.\nKwama Hive.\nThe most prominent business in Morrowind is operating a mine of &lt;a href=\"Kwama\"&gt;Kwama&lt;/a&gt;s. The Kwama is a large insectoid that works like ants or bees, with workers and a Queen. It is a large hive mine that burrows through tunnels. There are several variations of the Kwama that work in the mine. The &lt;a href=\"Kwama%20Queen\"&gt;Kwama Queen&lt;/a&gt; is a large creature that is immobile and serves as the matriarch of the whole operation. The Queen has a bloated thorax that produces the Kwama Eggs that are cooked in Dunmeri cuisine. It is common knowledge to avoid the Queen as much as you can because the Kwama Hive would become viciously hostile. The &lt;a href=\"Kwama%20Warrior\"&gt;Kwama Warrior&lt;/a&gt; is the protector of the Hive, constantly attacking invaders of the hive. They are large bipedal Kwama with a thick exoskeleton. The &lt;a href=\"Kwama%20Worker\"&gt;Kwama Worker&lt;/a&gt; serves as the overall worker of the hive, digging through the caves and maintaining the eggs produced by the Kwama Queen. They can be defensive over the Hive but are mainly indifferent. Last is the &lt;a href=\"Scrib\"&gt;Scrib&lt;/a&gt;, tiny variations of the Kwama that have no purpose whatsoever, other than producing &lt;a href=\"Scrib%20Jelly\"&gt;Scrib Jelly&lt;/a&gt;, which is used in various potions.\nGiant Wasps.\nBecause of the region's proximity to the province of &lt;a href=\"Black%20Marsh\"&gt;Black Marsh&lt;/a&gt;, most of the creatures found there have spilled into the Deshaan Grazelands, and this includes the &lt;a href=\"Giant%20Wasp\"&gt;Giant Wasp&lt;/a&gt;. The Giant Wasp is a vile creature that lurks in humid areas, coincidental where the Argonians of the area have lived in. These Wasps have razor-sharp incisors and thin-gripping hook arms that grabbed onto unsuspecting prey. Its main form of defense comes in the form of a large stinger, which pierces through anyone. Victims of the Giant Wasp will have eggs buried in their body, which would then explode out of the body. Their eyes become pure black and a golden-colored drool will come out of their mouth when the eye is stored in the body. Once they are born, they require feeding instantly. Interestingly, depending on the host body, the Giant Wasp's stinger can come in different colors. For example, if the Wasp is born in an Argonian body, their thorax comes in a rainbow-ish hue. It is unknown what the other colors are when it is born in other races.\nFlora.\nDeshaan sports the typical flora that is seen throughout the province of Morrowind, the towering mushrooms, and the otherworldy plants. The &lt;a href=\"Emperor%20Parasol\"&gt;Emperor Parasol&lt;/a&gt; is a large mushroom that is seen all throughout Morrowind, these fungal trees produce a delectable moss called the &lt;a href=\"Emperor%20Parasol%20Moss\"&gt;Emperor Parasol Moss&lt;/a&gt;, which has various alchemical properties about health. These mushrooms come in different quantities, either they are found in clusters or seldom in the wilderness. They can also be short, in their perspective, and be tall and slightly staggering. The Great House Dres and minor settlements have various plantations in both Deshaan and other fertile grazelands. The most common crop these farms grow is the &lt;a href=\"Saltrice\"&gt;Saltrice&lt;/a&gt;, which mainly comes from southeastern Morrowind. Saltrice is a type of wheat that is brewed into &lt;a href=\"Mazte\"&gt;Mazte&lt;/a&gt;, which is a common alcoholic drink that is popular in Morrowind. Other than Mazte, Saltrice is made into &lt;a href=\"Deshaan%20Honeydew%20Hors%20D%27Ouevre\"&gt;Deshaan Honeydew Hors D'Ouevre&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Food%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Narsis Bantam Guar Hash&lt;/a&gt;. The &lt;a href=\"Xylaria\"&gt;Xylaria&lt;/a&gt; is an unusual plant that is common throughout the Grazelands of Morrowind. These plants have long, moving tendrils spouting out of the tip. It is unknown what use these plants have in Dark Elven mixtures or concoctions, but they are prevalent nonetheless.\nGovernment.\nIt is well-known throughout the Empire that the province of Morrowind is governed by the &lt;a href=\"Great%20Houses\"&gt;Great Houses&lt;/a&gt;, political parties that survey the various spheres of influence in society, which includes, agriculture, economy, education, religion, and warfare. The five cornerstones of civilization. Each of the Great Houses has their own capital, built in their unique image. The city-states of Mournhold and Narsis are the capitals of the Great Houses of Indoril and Hlaalu respectively. &lt;a href=\"House%20Hlaalu\"&gt;House Hlaalu&lt;/a&gt; represents the economy and their traditional color is yellow. They are experts in the art of trading and are known to have close relations with the &lt;a href=\"Third%20Empire\"&gt;Third Empire&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"Cyrodiil\"&gt;Cyrodiil&lt;/a&gt;. Like the Empire, House Hlaalu allows the freedom of religion and other practices in that fashion. The origins of House Hlaalu date back to several years and their ideas follow the book, \"&lt;a href=\"The%20Book%20of%20Grasping%20Fortune\"&gt;The Book of Grasping Fortune&lt;/a&gt;.\" The House Hlaalu-folk aspire for peace within the Ashlands and Grazelands of Morrowind, though as fate would have it, this would not be the case when House Hlaalu lost the status of Great Houses to the more obscure &lt;a href=\"House%20Sadras\"&gt;House Sadras&lt;/a&gt;. This decision was carried out by the Great &lt;a href=\"House%20Redoran\"&gt;House Redoran&lt;/a&gt;. House Hlaalu architecture shares a resemblance to the Imperials. They come in clay, multi-floored style buildings with arched entryways and modestly decorated exteriors. As the traditional Hlaalu saying goes, \"\"To trade fairly and freely is to honor the Three.\" - Saint Veloth the Pilgrim is the patron saint of House Hlaalu.\"\n&lt;a href=\"House%20Indoril\"&gt;House Indoril&lt;/a&gt; represents religion and their traditional color is blue. The Great House Indoril fervently worships the Tribunal Temple and upholds their laws. Unlike House Hlaalu, the Indoril-elves have openly opposed the integration of Imperial culture into Morrowind, and they would instead preserve ancient Dunmeri culture, believing it is their sworn duty. Not only do they worship the Tribunal, but they honor the Saints of Morrowind and the Good Daedra, which consists of &lt;a href=\"Azura\"&gt;Azura&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Boethiah\"&gt;Boethiah&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Mephala\"&gt;Mephala&lt;/a&gt; respectively. Throughout Mournhold and their territories, the House Indoril employ the &lt;a href=\"Ordinators\"&gt;Ordinators&lt;/a&gt;, the temple guard and general militia that enforces the laws of the Tribunal and the Empire. Ordinators come into four sub-factions throughout the Indoril and Temple Districts. The &lt;a href=\"Order%20of%20the%20Watch\"&gt;Order of the Watch&lt;/a&gt; is the usual town guard that is seen throughout Tamriel, enforcing the law in the name of the Tribunal. The &lt;a href=\"Order%20of%20War\"&gt;Order of War&lt;/a&gt; is the military of House Indoril, battling the sworn enemies of the Tribunal and House Indoril. They can be found on the battlefield. The &lt;a href=\"Order%20of%20Doctrine%20and%20Ordination\"&gt;Order of Doctrine and Ordination&lt;/a&gt; are militant scholars that study the writings of the Tribunal. They can be found in places such as the Mournhold Temple and the Temple Canton of &lt;a href=\"Vivec%20City\"&gt;Vivec City&lt;/a&gt;. The &lt;a href=\"Order%20of%20Inquisition\"&gt;Order of Inquisition&lt;/a&gt; actively seek out insubordination within Morrowind that goes against the Tribunal. They are the special forces of the Ordinators.\nReligion.\nEver since the fateful &lt;a href=\"Battle%20of%20Red%20Mountain\"&gt;Battle of Red Mountain&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"1E%20700\"&gt;1E 700&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"Tribunal\"&gt;Tribunal&lt;/a&gt; has been the topic of religion in Morrowind. The Tribunal consists of the three god-kings of Morrowind, &lt;a href=\"Almalexia\"&gt;Almalexia&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Sotha%20Sil\"&gt;Sotha Sil&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Vivec\"&gt;Vivec&lt;/a&gt;, collectively known as the ALMSIVI. Each of the Living Gods has their own domain in Morrowind. Almalexia's domain is the city-state of Mournhold, which expanded into the greater city of Almalexia. Almalexia is also known as Mother Morrowind because she represents compassion and sympathy, not to mention the protector of the weak and unfortunate. The Tribunal Temple in Mournhold serves as her home, ever since the &lt;a href=\"Sack%20of%20Mournhold\"&gt;Sack of Mournhold&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"1E%202920\"&gt;1E 2920&lt;/a&gt;. According to several myths, Almalexia was born in &lt;a href=\"Mount%20Assarnibibi\"&gt;Mount Assarnibibi&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;a href=\"Molag%20Amur\"&gt;Molag Amur&lt;/a&gt; region of &lt;a href=\"Vvardenfell\"&gt;Vvardenfell&lt;/a&gt;, where &lt;a href=\"Molag%20Bal\"&gt;Molag Bal&lt;/a&gt; had overseen the ninety-nine lovers of &lt;a href=\"Boethiah\"&gt;Boethiah&lt;/a&gt;, one of them gave birth to Almalexia. Her actual origin is unknown to this day. Almalexia was fervently worshipped throughout the eras until in &lt;a href=\"4E%205\"&gt;4E 5&lt;/a&gt; when &lt;a href=\"Red%20Mountain\"&gt;Red Mountain&lt;/a&gt; erupted and caused Tribunal worship gradually decrease.\nDeshaan has been the center of significant events in Morrowind. Saint Veloth traveled to Resdayn by order of &lt;a href=\"Boethiah\"&gt;Boethiah&lt;/a&gt;, and established various settlements, including &lt;a href=\"Narsis\"&gt;Narsis&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Eidolon%27s%20Hollow\"&gt;Eidolon's Hollow&lt;/a&gt;, with the latter being a holy site for the Good Daedra of the &lt;a href=\"Dunmeri%20Pantheon\"&gt;Dunmeri Pantheon&lt;/a&gt;. The Good Daedra are mainly the original Tribunal, which consists of &lt;a href=\"Azura\"&gt;Azura&lt;/a&gt;, Boethiah, and &lt;a href=\"Mephala\"&gt;Mephala&lt;/a&gt;. When the Tribunal betrayed Indoril Nerevar for the attempt of godhood, Azura cursed them with the creation of the &lt;a href=\"Nerevarine%20Prophecy\"&gt;Nerevarine Prophecy&lt;/a&gt;, where Indoril Nerevar would be resurrected to defeat the Tribunal and to usher in a new era for the Dark Elves. That event would come in &lt;a href=\"3E%20427\"&gt;3E 427&lt;/a&gt; when the Nerevarine had killed &lt;a href=\"Dagoth%20Ur%20%28Character%29\"&gt;Dagoth Ur&lt;/a&gt; and Almalexia, who murdered Sotha Sil before her demise. The &lt;a href=\"Dissident%20Priests\"&gt;Dissident Priests&lt;/a&gt; returned to the Tribunal Temple and took over, bringing about the &lt;a href=\"New%20Temple\"&gt;New Temple&lt;/a&gt;, which worships the Good Daedra. House Indoril lost significant power with the death of the Tribunal. As of now, the House of Reclamations has become the dominant religion in not only Deshaan but the rest of Morrowind.\nHistory.\n&lt;a href=\"Merethic%20Era\"&gt;Merethic Era&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe Prophet Veloth &amp; his journey to Resdayn.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Aldmer\"&gt;Aldmer&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"Aldmeris\"&gt;Aldmeris&lt;/a&gt; traveled north to the modern-day province of the &lt;a href=\"Summerset%20Isles\"&gt;Summerset Isles&lt;/a&gt;, where they established the earliest settlements of modern-day Tamriel. As time went on, groups of Elves began to spread across the continent, one of them being the &lt;a href=\"Chimer\"&gt;Chimer&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href=\"Veloth\"&gt;Veloth&lt;/a&gt; was a Chimer born into nobility along with his elven brethren. On one fateful day, Veloth was visited by &lt;a href=\"Boethiah\"&gt;Boethiah&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"Daedric%20Prince\"&gt;Daedric Prince&lt;/a&gt; of Plots, who told the Chimer that even mortals could ascend to godhood. When told his peers about this, they rejected him, ultimately exiling him from his home. But during that time, he garnered various followers, and he took them to the promised land, the modern-day province of &lt;a href=\"Morrowind\"&gt;Morrowind&lt;/a&gt;. The journey was relentless, but the Chimer continued to follow Veloth, for his words brought them strength. Eventually, the Chimeri arrived onto Morrowind, establishing various settlements. Deshaan, even today holds influence from Veloth's time. The city-state of &lt;a href=\"Narsis-Where-All-Fervently-Praise-the-Prophet-Veloth\"&gt;Narsis-Where-All-Fervently-Praise-the-Prophet-Veloth&lt;/a&gt; was created along the shores of &lt;a href=\"Lake%20Hlaalu\"&gt;Lake Hlaalu&lt;/a&gt;. The temple of &lt;a href=\"Eidolon%27s%20Hollow\"&gt;Eidolon's Hollow&lt;/a&gt; was the holiest site in Morrowind for the &lt;a href=\"House%20of%20Reclamations\"&gt;House of Reclamations&lt;/a&gt;. The &lt;a href=\"Shrine%20of%20Saint%20Veloth\"&gt;Shrine of Saint Veloth&lt;/a&gt; is where the Prophet Veloth would be buried. All through Deshaan, his artifacts are preserved, from &lt;a href=\"Muth%20Gnaar\"&gt;Muth Gnaar&lt;/a&gt; to &lt;a href=\"Selfora\"&gt;Selfora&lt;/a&gt;. Veloth's legacy would last forever as Morrowind grows. The idea that mortals could ascend to godhood when the &lt;a href=\"Tribunal\"&gt;Tribunal&lt;/a&gt; had begun to appear ever since the &lt;a href=\"Battle%20of%20Red%20Mountain\"&gt;Battle of Red Mountain&lt;/a&gt;.\n&lt;a href=\"First%20Era\"&gt;First Era&lt;/a&gt;.\nSack of Mournhold; Battle between Gods.\nDuring the waning years of the first era in &lt;a href=\"1E%202920\"&gt;1E 2920&lt;/a&gt;, the city-state of Mournhold was ruled by &lt;a href=\"Brindisi%20Dorom\"&gt;Brindisi Dorom&lt;/a&gt;, a member of the Great House Indoril. At the time, Duke Dorom had a mistress who hailed from House Redoran, named &lt;a href=\"Turala\"&gt;Turala&lt;/a&gt;. At some point in time, Turala became pregnant with Brindisi's child, much to the dismay of the duke. When he had realized what was going on, he banished Turala out of Morrowind. At the &lt;a href=\"Kavas%20Rim%20Pass\"&gt;Kavas Rim Pass&lt;/a&gt;, Turala gave birth to her child, &lt;a href=\"Bosriel\"&gt;Bosriel&lt;/a&gt; with the help of unknown entity. In her travels, Turala met a man named &lt;a href=\"Cassyr%20Whitley\"&gt;Cassyr Whitley&lt;/a&gt;, a veteran of the &lt;a href=\"Four%20Score%20War\"&gt;Four Score War&lt;/a&gt;, originating from the &lt;a href=\"Barony%20of%20Dwynnen\"&gt;Barony of Dwynnen&lt;/a&gt;. Cassyr held a serious grudge with &lt;a href=\"Vivec\"&gt;Vivec&lt;/a&gt; of the &lt;a href=\"Tribunal\"&gt;Tribunal&lt;/a&gt; when he denounced the Breton spy of his duty when he was inadvertently responsible for &lt;a href=\"Cyrodiil\"&gt;Cyrodiil&lt;/a&gt;'s victory over Morrowind in the Four Score War. Both travelers went their separate ways, and both Turala and Bosriel encountered the &lt;a href=\"Skeffington%20Coven\"&gt;Skeffington Coven&lt;/a&gt;, a witches group in the Northern &lt;a href=\"Iliac%20Bay\"&gt;Iliac Bay&lt;/a&gt;. At one point, Cassyr and Turala had reunited, both residing in the Skeffington Wood. At some point, an &lt;a href=\"Orc\"&gt;Orc&lt;/a&gt;ish raiding party attacked the Skeffington Coven, killing everyone including the young Bosriel. As Turala was grieving and cursing their name, Cassyr lied to Turala, claiming that the Orcs were sent by Duke Brindisi Dorom. Enraged, Turala called upon the powers of &lt;a href=\"Mehrunes%20Dagon\"&gt;Mehrunes Dagon&lt;/a&gt; to destroy Mournhold, the Duke's domain.\nOn the 12th of &lt;a href=\"Sun%27s%20Dusk\"&gt;Sun's Dusk&lt;/a&gt;, a large gout of hellfire was what remained of the central courtyard at Castle Mournhold, spewing pillars of lava into the sky, blotting the clouds in the process. Heavy smoke riddled the streets while winged-creatures flew across the city-state, killing anything moving in fear. Mehrunes Dagon looked over the &lt;a href=\"Sack%20of%20Mournhold\"&gt;Sack of Mournhold&lt;/a&gt;, smiling, witnessing the destruction caused by his name until a light javelin pierced the Daedric Prince, which was thrown by &lt;a href=\"Sotha%20Sil\"&gt;Sotha Sil&lt;/a&gt;, whose accompanied by &lt;a href=\"Almalexia\"&gt;Almalexia&lt;/a&gt;. And so, the three entities battled each other over the burning city of Mournhold. In the end, Mehrunes Dagon was gravely wounded, as well as Almalexia, who was practically dead. Because of the Almalexia remained in Mournhold, overlooking the city's reconstruction and becoming their sacred guardian. It is unknown what became of both Cassyr Whitley and Turala Skeffington.\n&lt;a href=\"Second%20Era\"&gt;Second Era&lt;/a&gt;.\nWar of Two Houses; Hlaalu's Victory over Dres.\nThroughout the eras, the Great Houses of Morrowind have had animosity towards each other, and this is not something unique among the Houses, but there have been very few instances where the Great Houses wage war with each other. The city-state of Narsis is the capital of the Great House Hlaalu, and the area around it was subjugated to a conflict between House Hlaalu and &lt;a href=\"House%20Dres\"&gt;House Dres&lt;/a&gt;, whose capital city is &lt;a href=\"Tear\"&gt;Tear&lt;/a&gt;, which is considered a part of the Deshaan Plains. In &lt;a href=\"2E%20559\"&gt;2E 559&lt;/a&gt;, the Great Houses of Hlaalu and Dres fought each other in an area south of Narsis. The conflict's purpose was for control over the territory. During construction of a trading post, House Hlaalu was ambushed by House Dres. The workforce led by &lt;a href=\"Purilla%20Falen\"&gt;Purilla Falen&lt;/a&gt; was forced to hold their position until their Mage was able to open a portal to Narsis. The workforce was heavily outnumbered, with seven warriors plus one mage. In the end, three warriors including Purilla Falen remained alive, representing House Hlaalu. The portal to Narsis had finally opened, and a wave of Hlaalu Merchant-Warriors entered the fray, securing victory for House Hlaalu. Purilla Falen had died after the battle before she could have been healed. She was remembered as a Hero of House Hlaalu.\nThe Battle of Stonefalls &amp; the Ebonheart Pact.\nDuring the &lt;a href=\"Interregnum\"&gt;Interregnum&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"2E%20572\"&gt;2E 572&lt;/a&gt;, the continent of &lt;a href=\"Tamriel\"&gt;Tamriel&lt;/a&gt; was invaded by the &lt;a href=\"Snow%20Demons%20of%20Kamal\"&gt;Snow Demons of Kamal&lt;/a&gt;, under the leadership of &lt;a href=\"Ada%27Soom%20Dir-Kamal\"&gt;Ada'Soom Dir-Kamal&lt;/a&gt;, whose invasion force had wreaked havoc across Northern Tamriel. The &lt;a href=\"Second%20Akaviri%20Invasion\"&gt;Second Akaviri Invasion&lt;/a&gt; had attacked areas such as the &lt;a href=\"Telvanni%20Peninsula\"&gt;Telvanni Peninsula&lt;/a&gt; and eventually the city-state of &lt;a href=\"Windhelm\"&gt;Windhelm&lt;/a&gt;. When word of the Akaviri force had reached Mournhold, &lt;a href=\"Almalexia\"&gt;Almalexia&lt;/a&gt; herself called upon the warriors of Morrowind to gather and combat this threat, having &lt;a href=\"Tanval%20Indoril\"&gt;Tanval Indoril&lt;/a&gt; leading the helm. After bypassing &lt;a href=\"the%20Rift\"&gt;the Rift&lt;/a&gt;, the Akaviri attacked the Dark Elves in the mainland Ashlands, but in the end, the Dunmeri force was forced to retreat eastward, with the Akaviri following suit. Before they could defeat the Dark Elves, the &lt;a href=\"Nords\"&gt;Nords&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"Skyrim\"&gt;Skyrim&lt;/a&gt; appeared to the west, cornering the Kamali at &lt;a href=\"Vivec%27s%20Antlers\"&gt;Vivec's Antlers&lt;/a&gt;. Both the Nords or Dark Elves were unable to break the Akaviri's hold until the &lt;a href=\"Argonian\"&gt;Argonian&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Shellbacks\"&gt;Shellbacks&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"Black%20Marsh\"&gt;Black Marsh&lt;/a&gt; had arrived from Deshaan in the south, led by &lt;a href=\"Heita-Meen\"&gt;Heita-Meen&lt;/a&gt;. The three forces combined their powers and were able to destroy the Akaviri Army at the &lt;a href=\"Battle%20of%20Stonefalls\"&gt;Battle of Stonefalls&lt;/a&gt;. What came out of the conflict was the formation of the &lt;a href=\"Ebonheart%20Pact\"&gt;Ebonheart Pact&lt;/a&gt;, one of the greatest alliances in the history of Tamriel.\nThe Llodos Plague; Enter the Maulborn.\nDuring the &lt;a href=\"Interregnum\"&gt;Interregnum&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"2E%20582\"&gt;2E 582&lt;/a&gt;, a deadly disease known as the &lt;a href=\"Llodos%20Plague\"&gt;Llodos Plague&lt;/a&gt; began to spread across the Deshaan Plains, from Lake Hlaalu to the Padomaic Coast. The Dark Elves of Deshaan became seriously afflicted by the disease, looking for various ways to get a cure. Suspiciously, a group called the &lt;a href=\"Maulborn\"&gt;Maulborn&lt;/a&gt; had begun to arise throughout Deshaan, offering everyone a cure, making themselves out as saviors. The township of &lt;a href=\"Serkamora\"&gt;Serkamora&lt;/a&gt; was one of the first places that were afflicted by the disease, and so the Maulborn intervened to offer healing people with the disease. With the influx of the diseased, the town of Serkamora was renamed to Quarantine Serk. The Maulborn took to the Catacombs, where they would use it as a quarantine. But the Maulborn's intervention did not come with suspicion. &lt;a href=\"Aerona%20Berendas\"&gt;Aerona Berendas&lt;/a&gt; was a citizen of the Serk and was very suspicious to the Maulborn when her brother, &lt;a href=\"Dethisam%20Berendas\"&gt;Dethisam Berendas&lt;/a&gt; was taken to the Quarantine, and the group would not give more curative. With the help of an &lt;a href=\"Vestige\"&gt;estranged warrior&lt;/a&gt;, Aerona would learn from Dethisam that the Maulborn were responsible for the plague and were attempting to turn the afflicted into &lt;a href=\"Plague%20Husk\"&gt;Plague Husk&lt;/a&gt;s. When they left the catacombs, bottles of the curative were retrieved and given to the people, so that more bottles were made. With contents of the potion were noted and the people of the Serk had replicated the cure to the Llodos Plague, which consists of herbs including Kyne's Heart, Sour Milk Tea, and Dragon Scale Mushrooms.\nPollution at Lake Hlaalu &amp; the Narsis Kidnappings.\nThe word about the Llodos Plague had spread throughout Deshaan, creating paranoia. Many citizens of the Redolent Loam evacuated to the city-state of Mournhold. &lt;a href=\"Narsis\"&gt;Narsis&lt;/a&gt; has undergone its fair share of paranoia, people are in a constant state of panic when several townsfolk began to disappear throughout Narsis, seemingly kidnapped. &lt;a href=\"Councilor%20Ralden\"&gt;Councilor Ralden&lt;/a&gt; gave the command to &lt;a href=\"Giron%20Sadri\"&gt;Giron Sadri&lt;/a&gt; for the City Guards. Giron Sadri wanted to seal off the city to prevent the spread of the disease, but Ralden wants to keep it open since Narsis is a trading center, but he does admit to the recent decrease in visitors. The estranged warrior from the Serk arrived onto Narsis and offered their aid in the recent disappearances, talking with Giron Sadri as well. The warrior spoke with several townsfolk for information. The warrior met &lt;a href=\"Naryu%20Virian\"&gt;Naryu Virian&lt;/a&gt;, an Agent of the &lt;a href=\"Morag%20Tong\"&gt;Morag Tong&lt;/a&gt; that was hired for the same purpose they were. &lt;a href=\"Evis%20Marys\"&gt;Evis Marys&lt;/a&gt; was a citizen of Narsis that was hired to bring shipments of the Llodos Plague. According to several citizens, mysterious crates began to appear in Narsis and people the contents. A book was recovered stating how well the plague works with corpse's blood and it needs to be dumped into wells. These findings were reported to Councilor Ralden.\nWith this information, Councilor Ralden puts the city-state of Narsis on lockdown, preventing movement through Narsis. When reporting to Giron Sadri, the &lt;a href=\"Vestige\"&gt;estranged traveler&lt;/a&gt; was sent to the shores of Lake Hlaalu, where the Maulborn were camped out. At the campsite, the traveler discovered that the Maulborn had dumped the concoctions containing the plague into the Lake, to poison the people. It was here the traveler reunited with Naryu Virian, who reveals that Giron Sadri was in league with the Maulborn and wants the traveler dead, the two returned to Narsis to confront Sadri. By the time they returned, both Ralden and Sadri disappeared, bring more suspicion to Giron Sadri. With the help of the townsfolk in Narsis, the estranged traveler was able to find the missing people and learned that Giron Sadri escaped to the nearby &lt;a href=\"Narsis%20Ruins\"&gt;Narsis Ruins&lt;/a&gt;. The traveler followed suit and defeated the Hlaalu councilman at the ruins. Narsis was saved, but the plague is still moving, towards the city-state of Mournhold. Naryu Virian looks for the estranged warrior for another mission.\nRouting at the Maulborn at the Obsidian Gorge.\nWith the situation at Narsis dealt with, the warriors of House Hlaalu began to make their move on the Maulborn, who are situated at the &lt;a href=\"Obsidian%20Gorge\"&gt;Obsidian Gorge&lt;/a&gt;, the primary trading route between Narsis and Mournhold. Under the command of &lt;a href=\"Captain%20Diiril\"&gt;Captain Diiril&lt;/a&gt;, House Hlaalu had begun a investigated the Obsidian Gorge, securing the area before they could continue with the bottles of Plague Husk Scent. Naryu Virian and the estranged warrior traversed the battle at Obsidian Gorge, where the warrior encountered the battle-damaged, &lt;a href=\"Scout%20Mamyne\"&gt;Scout Mamyne&lt;/a&gt;, who told them that Maulborn created a stronger potent of the plague and planned to infect Mournhold. Mamyne had the champion gather six forged shipping manifests for Mournhold and brought it to Captain Diiril. With Mamyne's intel, the Maulborn had taken several scouts into the Daedric ruins.\nThe Maulborn Agents at the Obsidian Gorge used wards to protect themselves from the spread of the plague. Captain Diiril found the crates of Plague Husk Scent and planned to destroy it, to route out the Maulborn. By both Virian and the warrior's order, the crates were destroyed and the diseased spread throughout the Gorge. The traveler rendezvoused with Captain Diiril at the Apothecarium, where &lt;a href=\"Merdyndril\"&gt;Merdyndril&lt;/a&gt;, the creator of the plague was hiding. Unfortunately, Diiril was infected by the plague, and the warrior was forced to kill both Merdyndril and Diiril. The Plague was no longer able to be made, and the plague at the Gorge was eliminated with the potent from the Serk. Deshaan was freed from the plague, but the Maulborn was still active. By order of &lt;a href=\"Varon%20Davel\"&gt;Varon Davel&lt;/a&gt;, an ally of Ralden and Virian, the traveler left for Mournhold, the center of Deshaan.\nCivil Uproar in Mournhold &amp; the Maulborn's plot against the Three.\nNews of the Llodos Plague spread, ironically like the plague, all over Deshaan, prompting a state of panic throughout the Grazelands. All over the region, people fled for Mournhold in the attempt to avoid the plague, but this had made the city more of a target to the Maulborn. The &lt;a href=\"Ordinator\"&gt;Ordinator&lt;/a&gt;s had to take extra precautions by having newly-arrived citizens sign a registrar to enter the city. When the estranged warrior had arrived onto Mournhold, they were called upon by &lt;a href=\"Almalexia\"&gt;Almalexia&lt;/a&gt; herself, who gave them the task of uncovering the Maulborn in her city. The warrior met with Naryu Virian at &lt;a href=\"the%20Flaming%20Nix\"&gt;the Flaming Nix&lt;/a&gt; at the Plaza of the Gods, where they would investigate the presence of &lt;a href=\"House%20Dres\"&gt;House Dres&lt;/a&gt;, who are allies of the Maulborn. With the key of a courier, the two infiltrated the Mournhold Underground through the &lt;a href=\"House%20Dres%20Farmstead\"&gt;House Dres Farmstead&lt;/a&gt;. Deep in the Underground sewers, &lt;a href=\"Maulborn%20Commander%20Kalara\"&gt;Maulborn Commander Kalara&lt;/a&gt; had kidnapped &lt;a href=\"Farona%20Telvanni\"&gt;Farona Telvanni&lt;/a&gt; of the local &lt;a href=\"Mages%20Guild\"&gt;Mages Guild&lt;/a&gt; and amassed a small army from underneath the &lt;a href=\"Mournhold%20Temple\"&gt;Mournhold Temple&lt;/a&gt;. Both the warrior and Virian fought against the Maulborn Militia but were ultimately outnumbered, until Almalexia herself had appeared before the two travelers. With her divine power, she teleported both warriors out of the sewers and obliterated the threat in the sewers. Although, remnants of the invading force was able to escape Almalexia's wrath, and so they continued their assault on Mournhold, through the Tribunal Temple of Mournhold.\nAssault on the Tribunal Temple &amp; Veloth's Judgment.\nThe assault on the Tribunal Temple had commenced under the command of &lt;a href=\"Sathram\"&gt;Sathram&lt;/a&gt;, a Maulborn priest and &lt;a href=\"Magistrix%20Vox\"&gt;Magistrix Vox&lt;/a&gt;, leader of the Maulborn Cult. With their summoned &lt;a href=\"Daedra\"&gt;Daedra&lt;/a&gt;, the Maulborn was able to take control of the Tribunal Temple, forcing everyone out in the process. Using Daedric Magic, Magistrix Urili Vox had taken the &lt;a href=\"Judgment%20of%20Saint%20Veloth\"&gt;Judgment of Saint Veloth&lt;/a&gt; from the High Chapel, taking it deep into the grazelands of &lt;a href=\"Siltreen\"&gt;Siltreen&lt;/a&gt;. Almalexia tasked the &lt;a href=\"Vestige\"&gt;estranged warrior&lt;/a&gt; with rooting out the Maulborn from the temple. When the warrior entered the temple, they fought through various Daedric creatures such as the &lt;a href=\"Watcher\"&gt;Watcher&lt;/a&gt; and closing the several portals bringing in the Daedra. As Vox escaped, Sathram held the Tribunal Temple, giving the Magistrix the time to escape. The High Chapel where Sathram was located, is sealed off and the warrior needed to gain the blessings of the Tribunal to enter the Temple. The warrior took upon various trials relating to the Tribunal's sphere of influence. With blessings of the three, the champion was able to enter the High Chapel, battling Sathram and defeating him. Mournhold was saved from the Maulborn, but Magistrix Vox and Veloth's Judgment were still at large. She was reportedly heading for Selfora.\nRestless Spirits in Selfora &amp; the Forlorn One.\nAfter the events in Mournhold, Magistrix Vox had wielded the Judgment of Saint Veloth, an artifact with immense capabilities. The region would know the power that Vox wielded when she arrived onto the town of &lt;a href=\"Selfora\"&gt;Selfora&lt;/a&gt;. The town was swarming with restless spirits, and a large crater was in the middle of the town square. The survivors fled to the local inn to protect themselves from the spirits. Our estranged warrior arrived in Selfora to help &lt;a href=\"Elynisi%20Arthalen\"&gt;Elynisi Arthalen&lt;/a&gt;, a citizen of Selfora who had lost her father during the recent attack. The traveler left for the Tribunal Temple in Selfora, where they met the &lt;a href=\"Forlorn%20One\"&gt;Forlorn One&lt;/a&gt;, a spirit that died from the attack. The spirit begins to show the traveler visions of the past, including when the Magistrix arrived onto Selfora Temple, stealing &lt;a href=\"the%20Holy%20Vessel%20of%20Veloth\"&gt;the Holy Vessel of Veloth&lt;/a&gt; and killing the priests of the Temple. One of the priests was &lt;a href=\"Tidyn%20Arthalen\"&gt;Tidyn Arthalen&lt;/a&gt;, who became the Forlorn One. With his divine power, the estranged warrior fought the Echo of Vox at the central crater, freeing the town of the restless spirits. With the Tidyn's knowledge, the warrior traveled to the &lt;a href=\"Shrine%20of%20Saint%20Veloth\"&gt;Shrine of Saint Veloth&lt;/a&gt;, where Vox had taken the Judgment and Holy Vessel of Saint Veloth.\nDesecration at Saint Veloth's Shrine &amp; the Daedric Attack.\nMagistrix Vox and her legion of &lt;a href=\"Daedra\"&gt;Daedra&lt;/a&gt; attacked the Shrine of Saint Veloth, one of the holiest places in Morrowind. Her disturbance caused &lt;a href=\"Saint%20Veloth\"&gt;Saint Veloth&lt;/a&gt;'s power to fade away, blurring the line connecting the Acolytes of the area from the Prophet. The Ebonheart Pact and the Ordinators of Mournhold had intervened in the situation, under the command of &lt;a href=\"Ordinator%20Muron\"&gt;Ordinator Muron&lt;/a&gt;. The Daedra invaded the Shrine and killed several Acolytes in the process. The estranged warrior joined the fray and rebuilt the Reliquary of Saint Veloth, giving them the ability to commune with the spirit of Saint Veloth himself. The Prophet Veloth gave the warrior insight on Vox's exploits in the area, telling them that Vox escaped for &lt;a href=\"Eidolon%27s%20Hollow\"&gt;Eidolon's Hollow&lt;/a&gt;. He gave them his blessing and the ability to enter a plane, where all of the souls of the Judgment's victims reside. In that plane is &lt;a href=\"Meram%20Vox\"&gt;Meram Vox&lt;/a&gt;, the Magistrix's son and her drive for leading the Maulborn. The Ordinator would battle against Vox's militia at the Battle of Eidolon's Hollow.\nBattle of Eidolon's Hollow &amp; the Fall of Vox.\nThe Ruins of Eidolon's Hollow devolved into a battlefield, between the Ordinators of Mournhold and the Daedric Horde that Urili Vox had summoned, replacing the now-defunct Maulborn. Her legions of Daedra were able to hold back the Ordinators until the &lt;a href=\"Vestige\"&gt;estranged warrior&lt;/a&gt; had intervened, defeating the high-ranking Daedra overlooking the battle. The warrior was able to infiltrate Eidolon's Hollow and encounter a &lt;a href=\"Chimer\"&gt;Chimer&lt;/a&gt;i ghost known as &lt;a href=\"Aspera%20the%20Forgotten\"&gt;Aspera the Forgotten&lt;/a&gt;, who showed the warrior the Magistrix's past. Earlier in the year, Urili Vox was the Magistrix of Morals at the Tribunal Temple of Mournhold. At one point, Meram Vox, Urili's son had communed with &lt;a href=\"Boethiah\"&gt;Boethiah&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"Daedric%20Prince\"&gt;Daedric Prince&lt;/a&gt; of Plots, who told him to forsake the Tribunal, for they are false gods. Meram attempted to steal the Judgment of Saint Veloth until he was discovered by Almalexia, who destroyed the Dark Elf with the hammer, despite Urili's pleas. Even when people such as &lt;a href=\"Tidyn%20Arthalen\"&gt;Tidyn Arthalen&lt;/a&gt; had supported Meram, the Dunmeri youth had his fate sealed by the hands of Mother Morrowind. In the shadows, Urili plotted against the Tribunal, establishing connections with Merdyndril and Sathram, thus leading to the events of today. With this knowledge, the warrior sought the spirit of Meram Vox, to put the Magistrix at ease. Eventually, Magistrix Urili Vox was defeated and the Deshaan region was saved. Though a new threat would appear in the region of &lt;a href=\"Shadowfen\"&gt;Shadowfen&lt;/a&gt;.\nFoundation of Almalexia City &amp; Queen Barenziah.\nSeveral years later during the waning years of the Interregnum, &lt;a href=\"Tiber%20Septim\"&gt;Tiber Septim&lt;/a&gt; invaded the province of Morrowind after &lt;a href=\"Hammerfell\"&gt;Hammerfell&lt;/a&gt;, attacking the country along the western border, from the faraway city-states &lt;a href=\"Blacklight\"&gt;Blacklight&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Kragenmoor\"&gt;Kragenmoor&lt;/a&gt;. The Septim Grand Army advanced into the Deshaan Plains, towards the city-state of Mournhold. In response to this, Almalexia commissioned an extension for Mournhold, doubling in size than the current Mournhold, being dubbed Almalexia, following the same trend as other Tribunal domains (i.e. &lt;a href=\"Vivec%20City\"&gt;Vivec City&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Clockwork%20City\"&gt;Sotha Sil&lt;/a&gt;). But regardless, Mournhold was sacked by the forces of Tiber Septim, the King and Queen of Mournhold were killed amidst the conflict, leaving their child, &lt;a href=\"Barenziah\"&gt;Barenziah&lt;/a&gt; orphaned amidst the rubble. Barenziah would be discovered by &lt;a href=\"Symmachus\"&gt;Symmachus&lt;/a&gt;, a Dark Elven general of the &lt;a href=\"Imperial%20Legion\"&gt;Imperial Legion&lt;/a&gt;. Symmachus left Barenziah in the care of &lt;a href=\"Count%20Sven%20Advensen\"&gt;Count Sven Advensen&lt;/a&gt;, a retired member of the Legion that was given leadership of &lt;a href=\"Darkmoor\"&gt;Darkmoor&lt;/a&gt;, a township in Skyrim. As time went on, the Conquest over Morrowind ended with the &lt;a href=\"Treaty%20of%20the%20Armistice\"&gt;Treaty of the Armistice&lt;/a&gt; and Barenziah returned to the throne of Mournhold, with Symmachus as her husband. She would rule Mournhold into the third era and throughout the &lt;a href=\"Septim%20Dynasty\"&gt;Septim Dynasty&lt;/a&gt;.\n&lt;a href=\"Third%20Era\"&gt;Third Era&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe Arnesian War &amp; the Death of King Symmachus.\nDuring the &lt;a href=\"Imperial%20Simulacrum\"&gt;Imperial Simulacrum&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"3E%20389\"&gt;3E 389&lt;/a&gt; to &lt;a href=\"3E%20399\"&gt;3E 399&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Emperor\"&gt;Emperor&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Uriel%20Septim%20VII\"&gt;Uriel Septim VII&lt;/a&gt; was imprisoned along with &lt;a href=\"Talin%20Warhaft\"&gt;Talin Warhaft&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;a href=\"Deadlands\"&gt;Deadlands&lt;/a&gt; by &lt;a href=\"Jagar%20Tharn\"&gt;Jagar Tharn&lt;/a&gt;. Tharn planned for months to capture the throne, and he was able to achieve so in the span of ten years. Tharn had a powerful weapon called the &lt;a href=\"Staff%20of%20Chaos\"&gt;Staff of Chaos&lt;/a&gt;, and he split it into nine pieces and scattered them across Tamriel, the staff was the only thing keeping Uriel Septim and Warhaft in &lt;a href=\"Oblivion\"&gt;Oblivion&lt;/a&gt;. A warrior escaped his clutches and traveled all corners of Tamriel to retrieve the missing pieces. The hero was known as the &lt;a href=\"Eternal%20Champion\"&gt;Eternal Champion&lt;/a&gt;, and he assembled the staff and defeated Jagar Tharn at the &lt;a href=\"Imperial%20Palace\"&gt;Imperial Palace&lt;/a&gt;. Civil unrest had spread throughout Tamriel; the provinces had warred against each other one such conflict was the &lt;a href=\"Arnesian%20War\"&gt;Arnesian War&lt;/a&gt;. The region of Deshaan was undefined, and many settlements dotted the landscape or at least the general area. The cities of Mournhold and Narsis were situated on the east and south ends of the province respectively. Smaller townships including &lt;a href=\"Silnim%20Dale\"&gt;Silnim Dale&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Amber%20Forest\"&gt;Amber Forest&lt;/a&gt; inhabit the region.\nQueen Barenziah ruled the city-state of Mournhold all throughout the Septim Dynasty, from Tiber Septim to &lt;a href=\"Uriel%20Septim%20VII\"&gt;Uriel Septim VII&lt;/a&gt;, with Symmachus at her side. At some point in time, the couple had two children, &lt;a href=\"Helseth%20Hlaalu\"&gt;Helseth Hlaalu&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Morgiah\"&gt;Morgiah&lt;/a&gt;, both of whom would grow up to become substantial leaders. The Arnesian War had begun in Deshaan, more so in the nearby city-state of &lt;a href=\"Tear\"&gt;Tear&lt;/a&gt;, the capital of &lt;a href=\"House%20Dres\"&gt;House Dres&lt;/a&gt;. Civil unrest had started to evolve in Mournhold, prompting Barenziah to travel to the &lt;a href=\"Imperial%20City\"&gt;Imperial City&lt;/a&gt;, to speak with Uriel VII, not knowing that Jagar Tharn was impersonating him. Meanwhile, in Mournhold, Symmachus remained at the Royal Palace to fend off the revolt, but he had ultimately succumbed to the attacks, dying in battle. Once Barenziah returned to Mournhold, she was met with the unfortunate news and grieved for quite some time. Around this time, she met &lt;a href=\"Eadwyre\"&gt;Eadwyre&lt;/a&gt;, the King of &lt;a href=\"Wayrest\"&gt;Wayrest&lt;/a&gt;, who was a long-time friend of Symmachus. Eventually, the two were married and so Barenziah, with her two children moved to High Rock and the &lt;a href=\"Kingdom%20of%20Wayrest\"&gt;Kingdom of Wayrest&lt;/a&gt;. In her place, &lt;a href=\"Athyn%20Llethan\"&gt;Athyn Llethan&lt;/a&gt; took over as the High King of Mournhold, under the name of House Hlaalu.\nReturn of Barenziah &amp; High King Helseth Hlaalu.\nSometime after the &lt;a href=\"Warp%20in%20the%20West\"&gt;Warp in the West&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"3E%20417\"&gt;3E 417&lt;/a&gt;, Barenziah and Helseth returned to Mournhold, while Morgiah lived in &lt;a href=\"Firsthold\"&gt;Firsthold&lt;/a&gt; with her new husband. High King Athyn Llethan was elderly during his reign, and coincidentally when Helseth arrived, Llethan had mysteriously died, somewhat seen as calculated. With Barenziah retiring as a ruler, Helseth Hlaalu assumed the throne as the King of Morrowind, residing in the Royal Palace of Mournhold. Helseth was known throughout the realms for being ruthless in politics, going through that extra mile of blackmailing, bribery, and even assassination. In &lt;a href=\"3E%20427\"&gt;3E 427&lt;/a&gt;, the sub-continent of &lt;a href=\"Vvardenfell\"&gt;Vvardenfell&lt;/a&gt; has undergone noteworthy events, including the death of &lt;a href=\"Dagoth%20Ur%20%28Character%29\"&gt;Dagoth Ur&lt;/a&gt;, suppression of the &lt;a href=\"Blight\"&gt;Blight&lt;/a&gt;, and the sudden appearance of the &lt;a href=\"Nerevarine\"&gt;Nerevarine&lt;/a&gt;. Having a reputation for assassinations, King Helseth sent the &lt;a href=\"Dark%20Brotherhood\"&gt;Dark Brotherhood&lt;/a&gt; to kill the Nerevarine but what came out of it was the destruction of the Brotherhood and the whole ordeal being dismissed like it was nothing. The Nerevarine continued their stay in Mournhold.\nAlmalexia's Newest Champion &amp; the Fabricants of Sotha Sil.\nAs time went on, the Nerevarine had taken missions from Helseth Hlaalu and even orders from Almalexia herself. According to records, the Nerevarine undertook various missions, ranging from destroying a &lt;a href=\"Goblin\"&gt;Goblin&lt;/a&gt; Army created by Helseth to cleansing an ancient shrine of the Dead found in &lt;a href=\"Old%20Mournhold\"&gt;Old Mournhold&lt;/a&gt;. At one point, Almalexia tasked the Nerevarine, unknowing that this warrior was the Nerevarine, to retrieve the &lt;a href=\"Mazed%20Band\"&gt;Mazed Band&lt;/a&gt; from the clutches of the long-dead &lt;a href=\"Barilzar\"&gt;Barilzar&lt;/a&gt;, the former apprentice of &lt;a href=\"Sotha%20Sil\"&gt;Sotha Sil&lt;/a&gt;. The Mazed Band has special properties, including teleportation and opening rifts in-between time and space. Afterwards, a pack of &lt;a href=\"Verminous%20Fabricant\"&gt;Verminous Fabricant&lt;/a&gt;s stormed &lt;a href=\"Plaza%20Brindisi%20Dorom\"&gt;Plaza Brindisi Dorom&lt;/a&gt;, fighting against the &lt;a href=\"Ordinator\"&gt;Ordinator&lt;/a&gt;s of the area. With the Fabricants destroyed, Almalexia sends the Nerevarine to investigate, where they discovered the ruins of &lt;a href=\"Bamz-Amschend\"&gt;Bamz-Amschend&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Clockwork%20City\"&gt;Clockwork City&lt;/a&gt;. With this intel and believing that this warrior is the Nerevarine, she sends them to re-forge &lt;a href=\"Trueflame\"&gt;Trueflame&lt;/a&gt;, the Blade of &lt;a href=\"Indoril%20Nerevar\"&gt;Indoril Nerevar&lt;/a&gt;. The ruins of Bamz-Amschend were used by Almalexia, to control the weather throughout Mournhold and Deshaan. Mother Morrowind had the Nerevarine turn on &lt;a href=\"Karstangz-Bcharn\"&gt;Karstangz-Bcharn&lt;/a&gt; to summon ashstorms so that the people of Mournhold would respect her power. Afterwards, Almalexia disappears and returns, giving the Nerevarine the task of assassinating Sotha Sil, her longtime friend and member of the Tribunal.\nThe Fall of Almalexia &amp; the Nerevarine Prophecy.\nThe Nerevarine continued into Bamz-Amschend and took a portal to the Clockwork City, battling various Fabricants with Trueflame in hand. As the warrior continued into the fortress, they arrived into the &lt;a href=\"Dome%20of%20the%20Imperfect\"&gt;Dome of the Imperfect&lt;/a&gt; where they discovered the long dead-corpse of Sotha Sil, displayed onto his own contraption. As the Nerevarine was leaving the City, they are encountered by Almalexia, who has gone mad upon learning that her divinity and her power was going to be gone forever, should the Nerevarine succeed in their quest. But the &lt;a href=\"Nerevarine%20Prophecy\"&gt;Nerevarine Prophecy&lt;/a&gt; is meant to come to an end, and so the warrior battled Almalexia the Mad, who was in possession of &lt;a href=\"Hopesfire\"&gt;Hopesfire&lt;/a&gt;. In the end, Almalexia was ultimately defeated, wasted away within the vaults of the Clockwork City. The &lt;a href=\"Daedric%20Prince\"&gt;Daedric Prince&lt;/a&gt; of Dawn, &lt;a href=\"Azura\"&gt;Azura&lt;/a&gt;, came forth to the Nerevarine, stopping the ash storms from attacking Deshaan. As Almalexia and Sotha Sil disappeared from Morrowind, &lt;a href=\"Vivec\"&gt;Vivec&lt;/a&gt; had disappeared himself, but his fate is unknown. The Nerevarine had either killed him or the God had gone into hiding. The Death of Almalexia and Sotha Sil held impact in their own respective domain, but Vivec's death had not only affected &lt;a href=\"Vivec%20City\"&gt;Vivec City&lt;/a&gt; but it had changed Morrowind as we see into the fourth era.\n&lt;a href=\"Fourth%20Era\"&gt;Fourth Era&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe Effects of the Red Year; Mourning in Mournhold.\nAs time went on, the &lt;a href=\"Ministry%20of%20Truth\"&gt;Ministry of Truth&lt;/a&gt; that remained suspended above Vivec City had finally crashed into the city-state in &lt;a href=\"4E%205\"&gt;4E 5&lt;/a&gt;. According to records at the time, the area around the city turned deathly silent, and the ground had begun to rumble. The meteor crashed into Vivec City, causing a chain reaction that led to the eruption of &lt;a href=\"Red%20Mountain\"&gt;Red Mountain&lt;/a&gt;. The entirety of &lt;a href=\"Vvardenfell\"&gt;Vvardenfell&lt;/a&gt; was destroyed by the molten lava, from &lt;a href=\"Gnisis\"&gt;Gnisis&lt;/a&gt; to &lt;a href=\"Sadrith%20Mora\"&gt;Sadrith Mora&lt;/a&gt;. Areas throughout Morrowind were affected. Southern &lt;a href=\"Solstheim\"&gt;Solstheim&lt;/a&gt; was hit with ravaging ashstorms, obliterating the &lt;a href=\"Hirstaang%20Forest\"&gt;Hirstaang Forest&lt;/a&gt; and the faraway city-state of Tear was hit by various earthquakes, resulting in the walls to collapse. Mournhold and Narsis were not affected by the Red Year, though the people were in a state of grieving. Mournhold was the epicenter of Dunmeri society, so people in the city-state had family all throughout Vvardenfell. There was not a single night where people were not grieving intensely, at the dead of night. Fortunately, a &lt;a href=\"House%20Redoran\"&gt;House Redoran&lt;/a&gt; councilman in Mournhold took the initiative and created a relief effort about a month after the event. The current status of this effort is unknown, but places such as &lt;a href=\"Balmora\"&gt;Balmora&lt;/a&gt; had undergone reconstruction. But as Morrowind had brought itself back from devastation, worship over the Tribunal had begun to dwindle greatly.\nEffects of the Red Year; the New Temple.\nEver since the events in Mournhold, worship surrounding the Tribunal had begun to dwindle significantly. When the Red Year had occurred, it served as the final straw for Tribunal worship in Morrowind. Even through the terror, there were sects of Dark Elves that still believed in the Tribunal, though it soon left them completely. The &lt;a href=\"Dissident%20Priests\"&gt;Dissident Priests&lt;/a&gt; of the &lt;a href=\"Holamayan%20Monastery\"&gt;Holamayan Monastery&lt;/a&gt; took advantage of the situation, ushering in the &lt;a href=\"New%20Temple\"&gt;New Temple&lt;/a&gt;, a religion surrounding the original Tribunal of the Dunmer, the Good Daedra. The Tribunal was then given the position as Saints, so they were not completely forgotten, nor forsaken. The Ashlanders of Morrowind was pardoned and returned to modern-day Morrowind society. Groups such as the &lt;a href=\"Mabrigash%20Tribe\"&gt;Mabrigash Tribe&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Vereansu%20Tribe\"&gt;Vereansu Tribe&lt;/a&gt; were brought into the New Temple. House Indoril had suffered greatly from this transition, but it is considered a Great House when the priesthood and Indoril were considered one of the same. Those who follow the House of Reclamations are considered a part of the Great House Indoril. The New Temple would be established all throughout Morrowind.\nConquest over Morrowind; Enter the An-Xileel of Argonia.\nWhile the province of Morrowind suffered through the Red Year, the &lt;a href=\"Argonians\"&gt;Argonians&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"Black%20Marsh\"&gt;Black Marsh&lt;/a&gt; had thrived through the rising power of the &lt;a href=\"An-Xileel\"&gt;An-Xileel&lt;/a&gt;, a government inspired by the &lt;a href=\"Hist\"&gt;Hist&lt;/a&gt;. It was because of the An-Xileel, Black Marsh was able to survive the &lt;a href=\"Oblivion%20Crisis\"&gt;Oblivion Crisis&lt;/a&gt;, driving the Daedric Horde back into Oblivion. But as the An-Xileel grew, they had grown hungry, yearning for more power. The An-Xileel advanced into Morrowind, encompassing areas from Deshaan, all the way to the &lt;a href=\"Telvanni%20Peninsula\"&gt;Telvanni Peninsula&lt;/a&gt;. The newly-created &lt;a href=\"Accession%20War\"&gt;Accession War&lt;/a&gt; had ravaged Morrowind greatly; the Argonian Invasion Force sacked city-states such as Mournhold and Tear. Mournhold and the greater city-state of Almalexia were obliterated by the Argonians, forcing the entire Dunmeri government to change drastically. With their capital in ruins, the Dark Elves changed it to the city-state of &lt;a href=\"Blacklight\"&gt;Blacklight&lt;/a&gt;, the capital of the Great &lt;a href=\"House%20Redoran\"&gt;House Redoran&lt;/a&gt;. Because of this, House Redoran evolved into a higher status where they govern the rest of the Great Houses. Things would take a turn for the worst when the An-Xileel moved to the northeast, attacking House Telvanni, to the point where the Great House has faced near-extinction. Small sects of the Telvanni moved to &lt;a href=\"Skyrim\"&gt;Skyrim&lt;/a&gt;, specifically in places such as &lt;a href=\"Winterhold%20%28Region%29\"&gt;Winterhold&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"the%20Rift\"&gt;the Rift&lt;/a&gt;. Even groups of Argonians invaded faraway &lt;a href=\"Solstheim\"&gt;Solstheim&lt;/a&gt;, though it failed. But as time went on, Mournhold was rebuilt, bustling as usual.\nHouse Indoril in Mournhold created a building in Plaza Brindisi Dorom for the upcoming pilgrims and priests.\nThe Fall of House Hlaalu &amp; the Rise of House Sadras.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Oblivion%20Crisis\"&gt;Oblivion Crisis&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"3E%20433\"&gt;3E 433&lt;/a&gt; had left Morrowind in a state of disrepair, events such as the &lt;a href=\"Fall%20of%20Ald%27ruhn\"&gt;Fall of Ald'ruhn&lt;/a&gt; were evident of the battle that Morrowind had lost. The Third Empire had withdrawn from Morrowind, to defend their homeland of &lt;a href=\"Cyrodiil\"&gt;Cyrodiil&lt;/a&gt; and because of that, Morrowind was hit greatly. As a result of this, the Great Houses of Morrowind pinned the blame onto &lt;a href=\"House%20Hlaalu\"&gt;House Hlaalu&lt;/a&gt;, who had pushed for the Septim Empire's integration into the province. As a result, by order of House Redoran, House Hlaalu had their title of Great House revoked for the time being, with their replacement being the newly-named Great &lt;a href=\"House%20Sadras\"&gt;House Sadras&lt;/a&gt;. But as it would soon come to be, House Hlaalu did not sit well with this news and held a vendetta against House Redoran specifically. The first major attack on House Redoran was in the frontier colony of &lt;a href=\"Raven%20Rock\"&gt;Raven Rock&lt;/a&gt;, located in the island region of &lt;a href=\"Solstheim\"&gt;Solstheim&lt;/a&gt;. It was here that &lt;a href=\"Lleril%20Morvayn\"&gt;Lleril Morvayn&lt;/a&gt; had ruled from, being a member of the House Redoran Council. Morvayn would have an attempt on his life by &lt;a href=\"Vilur%20Ulen\"&gt;Vilur Ulen&lt;/a&gt;, would be captured and put to death. Eventually, his allies of House Hlaalu moved into Raven Rock under the guise of a family, governed by &lt;a href=\"Vendil%20Ulen\"&gt;Vendil Ulen&lt;/a&gt;, who posed as Vendil Severin. Eventually, his plot to assassinate Lleril was put to an end by an &lt;a href=\"Last%20Dragonborn\"&gt;estranged warrior&lt;/a&gt;, who helped restore Raven Rock Mine and defeating &lt;a href=\"General%20Falx%20Carius\"&gt;General Falx Carius&lt;/a&gt; at &lt;a href=\"Fort%20Frostmoth\"&gt;Fort Frostmoth&lt;/a&gt;.\nIt is unknown whatever happened to the various settlements residing in the &lt;a href=\"Hlaalu%20District\"&gt;Hlaalu District&lt;/a&gt;. With House Sadras assuming the role of Great House and replacing House Hlaalu, it can be considered that settlements such as Narsis, &lt;a href=\"Ebonheart\"&gt;Ebonheart&lt;/a&gt;, and Balmora had fallen under the control of House Sadras. There have been several instances where House Hlaalu is referred to as a Great House, dating as far back as &lt;a href=\"4E%20201\"&gt;4E 201&lt;/a&gt;, implying that their revoked status is not entirely lost. Regardless, House Hlaalu has a presence beyond Morrowind, as a descendant of the Great House Hlaalu owns property along the &lt;a href=\"Yorgrim%20River\"&gt;Yorgrim River&lt;/a&gt; near &lt;a href=\"Windhelm\"&gt;Windhelm&lt;/a&gt;, among other areas occupied by relatives."}

A significant portion of &lt;a href=\"Ashlanders%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Ashlanders&lt;/a&gt; can be found in the south and center of the zone, such as in &lt;a href=\"Muth%20Gnaar\"&gt;Muth Gnaar&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Vale%20of%20the%20Ghost%20Snake\"&gt;Ghost-Snake Vale&lt;/a&gt;.\nBackground.\nThe city of &lt;a href=\"Mournhold%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Mournhold&lt;/a&gt; is located in Deshaan, the center of Dunmeri culture, the location of the Tribunal Temple, and the capital of the &lt;a href=\"Ebonheart%20Pact\"&gt;Ebonheart Pact&lt;/a&gt;, as well as the capital of &lt;a href=\"Morrowind%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Morrowind&lt;/a&gt;.\nAn &lt;a href=\"Akaviri\"&gt;Akaviri&lt;/a&gt; army entered Deshaan in &lt;a href=\"2E%20572\"&gt;2E 572&lt;/a&gt; in the hopes of sacking Mournhold. However, they were met by an army led by &lt;a href=\"Almalexia%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Almalexia&lt;/a&gt; herself and were driven back to Stonefalls. As the battle raged on, a &lt;a href=\"Nords%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Nord&lt;/a&gt; army led by &lt;a href=\"Wulfharth%20the%20Ash-King\"&gt;Wulfharth the Ash-King&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Jorunn%20the%20Skald-King\"&gt;Jorunn the Skald-King&lt;/a&gt; caught up with the invaders and hoped to take revenge on the Akaviri for sacking the city of Windhelm. This was the first time a Nord army had entered Morrowind since the &lt;a href=\"Battle%20of%20Red%20Mountain\"&gt;Battle of Red Mountain&lt;/a&gt;.\nA fourth army of &lt;a href=\"Argonians%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Argonian&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Shellbacks\"&gt;Shellbacks&lt;/a&gt; led by a trio of Argonian battlemages entered the fray, and the three combined armies drove the Akaviri led by &lt;a href=\"Ada%27Soom%20Dir-Kamal\"&gt;Ada'Soom Dir-Kamal&lt;/a&gt; into the sea near the city of &lt;a href=\"Ebonheart%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Ebonheart&lt;/a&gt;, where they drowned by the thousands.\nLocations.\nThe following are locations accessible in Deshaan and, with the exception of &lt;a href=\"Unmarked%20Locations%20%28Online%29\"&gt;unmarked locations&lt;/a&gt;, are discoverable on the map. Points of Interest serve as locations with unique side quests, while &lt;a href=\"Cities%20%28Online%29\"&gt;cities&lt;/a&gt; serve as the centralised areas with multiple sublocations and act as a hub for services and &lt;a href=\"Merchants%20%28Online%29\"&gt;merchants&lt;/a&gt;. Explanations of the types of locations are provided in the &lt;a href=\"Locations%20%28Online%29%23Types\"&gt;main locations page&lt;/a&gt;.\nQuests.\nDeshaan features a series of zone story quests and unrelated side quests. The zone story quests tie into the Ebonheart Pact's overarching storyline and carries on from &lt;a href=\"Stonefalls%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Stonefalls&lt;/a&gt; before continuing to &lt;a href=\"Shadowfen\"&gt;Shadowfen&lt;/a&gt;, but it is not necessary to complete the story quests for zones prior to those in Deshaan. Side quests are non-sequential and can be completed in any order, except where one carries on from another, and &lt;a href=\"repeatable%20quests\"&gt;repeatable quests&lt;/a&gt; can be completed multiple times: weekly for arenas and trials and daily for all others. Pointer quests are optional zone quests that send the Vestige to the tarting location of another zone quest.\nItem Sets.\nItem sets are related armor and weapons that, when worn together, provide unique benefits. Overland sets can be acquired from world bosses, world events, delves, public dungeons and containers and as quest rewards; dungeon sets can be acquired from within group dungeons; monster sets can be acquired from the final boss of veteran group dungeons and Undaunted Enclaves; and crafted sets can be created at specific locations across the zone.\nSkyshards.\nSixteen Skyshards can be found in Deshaan totaling in five &lt;a href=\"skill%20points\"&gt;skill points&lt;/a&gt; with one left over. The zone guide provides clues as to the location of each Skyshard, but many can be found simply by exploring and watching for the distinctive pillar of light they emit. Skyshards will appear on the map and compass when the Vestige is close to one and will remain discovered on the map even if it was not collected.\nAchievements.\nAchievements can be earned by completing specific tasks such as completing quests and discovering locations. Achievements are separated into categories and their progress is viewable from the journal. Earning achievement provides the Vestige a number of points, and some achievements unlock unique rewards such as &lt;a href=\"Furnishings%20%28Online%29\"&gt;furnishings&lt;/a&gt; that can be bought from Achievement Furnishers or &lt;a href=\"collectibles\"&gt;collectibles&lt;/a&gt;.\nShalidor's Library.\nThirty-two books that are a part of Shalidor's Library can be found in Deshaan and added to the collection. Books that have already been found in other zones will already be marked as completed in the zone tracker.\nFish.\nFish can be caught from fishing hotspots, ideally with the correct &lt;a href=\"bait\"&gt;bait&lt;/a&gt;. Common fish will be caught most often while rare fish and alternative bait are rare catches. Each zone has unique rare fish than can be caught from hotspots. &lt;a href=\"Slaughterfish%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Slaughterfish&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"trodh\"&gt;trodh&lt;/a&gt; can be caught from foul hotspots, &lt;a href=\"dhufish\"&gt;dhufish&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"longfin\"&gt;longfin&lt;/a&gt; can be caught from saltwater hotspots, &lt;a href=\"silverside%20perch\"&gt;silverside perch&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"spadetail\"&gt;spadetail&lt;/a&gt; can be caught from lake hotspots, and &lt;a href=\"Salmon%20%28Online%29\"&gt;salmon&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"River%20Betty%20%28Online%29\"&gt;river betty&lt;/a&gt; can be caught from river hotspots. &lt;a href=\"Chub\"&gt;Chub&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"minnow\"&gt;minnow&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"shad\"&gt;shad&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"fish%20roe\"&gt;fish roe&lt;/a&gt; can be caught and used as bait from foul, saltwater, lake and river hotspots, respectively."}

It once served as the epicenter of the &lt;a href=\"Snow%20Elf\"&gt;Snow Elf&lt;/a&gt; religion, the chief deity of which was the &lt;a href=\"Aldmeri\"&gt;Aldmeri&lt;/a&gt; god &lt;a href=\"Auri-El\"&gt;Auri-El&lt;/a&gt;.\nBackground.\nIt was constructed in the &lt;a href=\"Merethic%20Era\"&gt;Merethic Era&lt;/a&gt; to provide a retreat for those who wished to become enlightened. Pilgrims undertaking this journey were called Initiates.\nAdditional temples existed throughout the empire to worship other deities such as &lt;a href=\"Trinimac\"&gt;Trinimac&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Syrabane\"&gt;Syrabane&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Jephre\"&gt;Jephre&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Phynaster\"&gt;Phynaster&lt;/a&gt;, but none were as grand as the Chantry of Auri-El.\nWayshrines.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Wayshrines%20%28Dawnguard%29\"&gt;wayshrines&lt;/a&gt; located throughout the chantry played an important part of the process. They represented the steps Initiates took on the path to total enlightenment. The magic used to construct them is believed to predate the First Era.\nSnow Elf priests, known as &lt;a href=\"Prelates\"&gt;Prelates&lt;/a&gt;, tended to these wayshrines. They were responsible for teaching Initiates the mantras of Auri-El. The symbolic rite stated that the initiate would fill a &lt;a href=\"Initiate%27s%20Ewer\"&gt;ewer&lt;/a&gt; with water from the central basin of a wayshrine after performing a mantra. Once the initiate's enlightenment was complete, they would bring the ewer to the Chantry's &lt;a href=\"Inner%20Sanctum\"&gt;Inner Sanctum&lt;/a&gt;. Pouring the contents of the ewer into the sacred basin thus allowing him access to the temple and would grant the Initiate an audience with the Arch-Curate himself, This in theory was to complete the initiates journey.\u00a0\nGenocide.\nAfter the war with the &lt;a href=\"Atmorans\"&gt;Atmorans&lt;/a&gt; in the Merethic Era, the Snow Elves were forced underground and eventually devolved into the &lt;a href=\"Falmer%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Falmer&lt;/a&gt;,\u00a0also to be known as the Betrayed. As the Chantry was isolated from both the Atmorans and Snow Elf alike, it was relatively unaffected by the war or the de-evolution of the Snow Elf race. Over time however, the Falmer discovered the well concealed Chantry and slaughtered the remaining survivors.\n&lt;a href=\"Knight-Paladin%20Gelebor\"&gt;Knight-Paladin Gelebor&lt;/a&gt; was one of the only survivors left, but despite the genocide, he remained inside the Chantry at his post guarding the first wayshrine. The Prelates were magically restored to a spectral state by Auri-El\u00a0to enable them to continue their duties.\nInteractions.\n&lt;a href=\"Touching%20the%20Sky%20%28Quest%29\"&gt;Touching the Sky&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe remnants of the Chantry can be found in &lt;a href=\"Darkfall%20Cave\"&gt;Darkfall Cave&lt;/a&gt; during this quest, and Knight-Paladin Gelebor can be found tending to the wayshrine. After speaking to him, he will give the Dragonborn an &lt;a href=\"Initiate%27s%20Ewer\"&gt;Initiate's Ewer&lt;/a&gt; and use Snow-Elf magic to open the first wayshrine, leading to &lt;a href=\"Darkfall%20Passage\"&gt;Darkfall Passage&lt;/a&gt;."}

A Daedra slain upon &lt;a href=\"Mundus\"&gt;Mundus&lt;/a&gt; is merely \"banished\" back to its plane of origin, where its morphotype, or \"&lt;a href=\"Vestige%20%28Essence%29\"&gt;vestige&lt;/a&gt;,\" gradually forms a new body, so that eventually the Daedra lives again (this happens as well when a Daedra is slain in its native plane of Oblivion). Daedra are formed from the very stuff of chaos, the \"creatia\" of Oblivion, a shapeless but energetic material that accretes around a vestige (formation of the body around the essence) until it conforms to the morphotype's inherent pattern. Chaotic creatia takes a different but planar-appropriate form in every realm of Oblivion. For example, &lt;a href=\"Dremora\"&gt;Dremora&lt;/a&gt; of the &lt;a href=\"Deadlands\"&gt;Deadlands&lt;/a&gt; have black, red or reddish black skin color, while the same species in &lt;a href=\"Coldharbour\"&gt;Coldharbour&lt;/a&gt; have cyan skin color, matching the environment of the realm.\nForms.\nIt is assumed that every plane of Oblivion has its own form of chaotic creatia. The following are the currently known:\nIn Coldharbour, it is represented by blue icy water, named &lt;a href=\"Azure%20Plasm\"&gt;Azure Plasm&lt;/a&gt;, and in the Shivering Isles the &lt;a href=\"Golden%20Saint\"&gt;Golden Saint&lt;/a&gt;s and &lt;a href=\"Dark%20Seducer\"&gt;Dark Seducer&lt;/a&gt;s bases, &lt;a href=\"Brellach\"&gt;Brellach&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Pinnacle%20Rock\"&gt;Pinnacle Rock&lt;/a&gt; respectively, contain Fonts of Rebirth.\nSome scholars believe that Hist sap, also called &lt;a href=\"Amber%20Plasm\"&gt;Amber Plasm&lt;/a&gt;, is a form of chaotic creatia."}

Many of these are groups that serve a gameplay function, such as &lt;a href=\"%23Monk\"&gt;Monk&lt;/a&gt;s selling &lt;a href=\"Trainers%20%28Morrowind%29\"&gt;Training&lt;/a&gt;. \nOthers are similar to Factions in that they are numerous throughout the game and have shared goals. Smugglers are also an example of a group with considerable game lore such as notes and books to link them together in shared circumstances prior to or during the story.\nAgent.\n\"I'm an agent. I work for a House, or a company, or the state, and I do things that need doing. Mostly I handle matters in the business or diplomatic line, things that require mercantile skills, or the arts of speechcraft. I trade in knowledge -- hard facts and rumors. 'Knowledge is power,' as they say. And sometimes I do other sorts of things. Things I can't talk about.\"\nAgents may have different specializations, &lt;a href=\"Attributes%20%28Morrowind%29\"&gt;Attributes&lt;/a&gt;, as well as different major and minor &lt;a href=\"Skills%20%28Morrowind%29\"&gt;skills&lt;/a&gt; depending on who they are.\n\"I'm an alchemist. Alchemy is the process of refining and preserving the magical properties hidden in natural and supernatural ingredients. I sell potions. I also sell the various kinds of apparatus alchemists need to make potions, and buy and sell ingredients.\"\nMajor Skills:\nMinor Skills:\nBuy and sell:\nApothecary.\n\"I'm an apothecary. I brew and sell potions to heal wounds, restore bodily and mental attributes, and cure diseases. I also buy and sell ingredients.\"\nMajor Skills:\nMinor Skills:\nBuy and sell:\n&lt;a href=\"Assassin\"&gt;Assassin&lt;/a&gt;.\n\"I'm an assassin. Killing is my profession. I am discrete, efficient, and reliable. In Morrowind, the assassin's trade is an ancient and honorable profession, restricted by a rigid code of conduct, and operating strictly within the law. Because I am discreet, I prefer short blades for swift, close-and personal work, while the marksman weapons like throwing stars and throwing knives are more suitable for stealth and surprise.\"\nMajor Skills: \nMinor Skills:\nBuys and sells:\n&lt;a href=\"Barbarian\"&gt;Barbarian&lt;/a&gt;.\n\"I'm a barbarian, and proud of it. I like the wilderness, and know how to live comfortably off the land. I know the various creatures of the wild, how to hunt them, what bits are good to eat, and what bits the city-folk will pay for. I know weapons and armor, and how to stay healthy, so I can play soldier for pay. But I hate taking orders, so I rather live by hunting.\"\nMajor Skills:\nMinor Skills:\n&lt;a href=\"Battlemage\"&gt;Battlemage&lt;/a&gt;.\n\"I am a Battlemage. Though arrayed as a Western knight with heavy armor, axes and long blades, my primary training is in the College of Alteration, the College of Destruction, and the College of Conjuration. To round out my education, I have mastered enchantments and alchemy. Potions made through alchemy, or purchased from alchemists, grant me the magics of the Restoration, Mysticism, and Illusion Colleges. And can there be any more terrible master of the science of war than a battlemage? I think not.\"\nMajor Skills: \nMinor Skills:\nSells:\nBookseller.\n\"I'm a bookseller. I buy and sell books. I also read books, and know the sorts of things you read in books. I don't mind sharing what I know about Morrowind lore, and am happy to share a little advice, if you're interested. I can also suggest who to talk to if you want to know more about a subject.\"\nMajor Skills:\nMinor Skills:\nSells and buys:\n&lt;a href=\"Buoyant%20Armiger%20%28Morrowind%29\"&gt;Buoyant Armiger&lt;/a&gt;.\n\"I am a Buoyant Armiger, a member of a small military order of the Tribunal Temple, exclusively dedicated to and answering to Lord Vivec. We pattern ourselves on Lord Vivec's heroic spirit of exploration and adventure, and emulate his mastery of the varied arts of personal combat, chivalric courtesy, and subtle verse. We serve the Temple as champions and knights-errant, and are friendly rivals of the more solemn Ordinators in our dedicated service to Lord Vivec and the Temple.\"\nMajor Skills:\nMinor Skills:\nCaravaner.\n\"I'm a caravaner. I can transport you by silt strider to various destinations for a modest fee.\"\nMajor Skills:\nMinor Skills:\nSells:\nChampion.\n\"I do not like to boast, but my people call me a champion, a noble warrior of the Ashlanders. I have the duty of protecting the honor of the tribe in peace and war. I give counsel to the ashkhan in tribal affairs, and represent the tribe to guests and intruders. There are things you should know about courtesy and challenges among the Ashlanders if you wish not to give offense.\"\nMajor Skills:\nMinor Skills:\nClothier.\n\"I am a clothier. I make clothes and sell them. I also buy clothes in good condition; with a little work I can make them good as new and resell them. Mostly I make and sell Dunmer clothing, but some people also want Imperial clothes and Ashlander clothes.\"\nMajor Skills:\nMinor Skills:\nBuys and sells:\nCommoner.\n\"I am a commoner. I do whatever needs doing -- cooking, cleaning, building, baking, making, breaking. And, by your accent, I can tell YOU are an outlander. Since you're new to these parts, perhaps you'd like me to share a little local lore.\"\nMajor Skills:\nMinor Skills:\n&lt;a href=\"Dreamer\"&gt;Dreamer&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe Dreamers are servants of &lt;a href=\"Dagoth%20Ur%20%28Character%29\"&gt;Dagoth Ur&lt;/a&gt;.\nMajor Skills:\nMinor Skills:\nDrillmaster.\n\"I am a drillmaster. I train and condition the local militia. I teach the citizens the basics of block, spear, and long blade, but mostly I concentrate on athletics and acrobatics, because conditioning is the biggest weakness of the citizen-soldier. No point teaching them to fight if they pass out after a short jog in full kit.\"\nMajor Skills:\nMinor Skills:\nSells:\n&lt;a href=\"Enchanter\"&gt;Enchanter&lt;/a&gt;.\n\"I am an enchanter. I enchant things, and sell them. I have scrolls, which are cheap, but only work once, and enchanted items, which work over and over again, but which are NOT cheap. I also make my enchanter's lab available to those who want to enchant items, but who can't afford the expense of building and maintaining a lab. I charge for the service, of course, but you must provide the items, soul gems, and magic effects. I also buy and sell enchanted weapons, enchanted armor, and enchanted clothing.\"\nMajor Skills:\nMinor Skills:\nBuys and sells:\nEnforcer.\n\"I am an enforcer. There are rules. The boss makes the rules. I enforce them. You break the rules, and you don't get to live a long productive life. So don't break the rules.\"\nMajor Skills:\nMinor Skills:\nFarmer.\n\"I am a farmer. I grow crops, and raise animals for food, and gather animal products and vegetable products from the land for my own use or for sale at the markets.\"\nMajor Skills:\nMinor Skills:\nGondolier.\n\"I'm a gondolier. I can ferry you by gondola to various nearby destinations for a modest fee.\"\nMajor Skills:\nMinor Skills:\nSells:\nGuard.\nMajor Skills:\nMinor Skills:\nGuild Guide.\n\"I'm a guild guide. I can teleport you to various destinations for a modest fee.\"\nMajor Skills:\nMinor Skills:\nSell:\nHealer.\n\"I am a healer. I have sworn solemn oaths in the College of Restoration to heal the afflicted and cure the diseased. But I have also studied both the unarmed, unarmored martial arts of the Khajiit and the light armored and blunt weapon styles of the Imperial West, both for self-defense, and for disabling or killing dangerous opponents. I sell spells, and I am a spellmaker who creates spells to your specifications. I can also teach you in my skills, for a fee.\"\nMajor Skills:\nMinor Skills:\nBuys and Sells:\nHerder.\n\"\"I am a herder. I watch over the tribe's herds of &lt;a href=\"Guar%20%28Morrowind%29\"&gt;Guar&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"shalk%20%28Morrowind%29\"&gt;shalk&lt;/a&gt;. I butcher the guar and shalk and preserve their meats to feed the tribe. I tan the &lt;a href=\"guar%20hide\"&gt;guar hide&lt;/a&gt;s, render the &lt;a href=\"shalk%20resin\"&gt;shalk resin&lt;/a&gt;s, and season the shalk shells. Then the tribe's craftsmen take these things and make the things we need for ourselves, and the things we sell to traders and other tribes.\"\"\nMajor Skills:\nMinor Skills:\nHunter.\n\"I am a hunter. I range across the ashlands and wastes, hunting for meat and hides. I know the native creatures of Vvardenfell, and know to avoid the diseased creatures, and the blighted creatures, for they are foul and worthless, and deadly to the careless hunter. I know the Ashlands and the Grazelands, Azura's Coast and Molag Amur, and can tell you of these places.\"\nMajor Skills:\nMinor Skills:\n&lt;a href=\"Mabrigash%20%28Morrowind%29\"&gt;Mabrigash&lt;/a&gt;.\n\"We are the Ashlander witch-warriors, women who defy the man's rules of behavior for women, mastering the man's weapons of war and the sorcerer's powerful magics. Craven men whine that we steal their vital essences to feed our dark purposes. But men are fools and cowards. Only women can understand the secrets of the ghost snake and its hidden mysteries that make men tremble like maidens.\"\nMajor Skills:\nMinor Skills:\nMage.\n\"I am a mage by profession, an accomplished master of destruction and alteration. However, at present I serve my house and council as Prefect of Hospitality for Sadrith Mora. House Telvanni maintains the Gateway Inn for the comfort and convenience of out-house and outlander guests in Sadrith Mora. For your own safety, unless you are retainer or kin of House Telvanni, we ask that you not travel in town without Hospitality Papers, and that you not sleep anywhere but here at the Gateway Inn.\"\nSell:\nMage Service.\n\"\"I am a mage. My study is the destruction and alteration of the visible and invisible world. I study magic for its pure intellectual challenge and rewards, but I am paid in gold for the practical applications of my knowledge. I defend myself with spells of the College of Destruction, and leap, swim, and levitate with the spells of the College of Alteration. I sell spells, and I am a spellmaker who creates spells to your specifications. I can also teach you in my skills, for a fee.\"\nMaster-at-Arms.\n\"I am a master-at-arms. I am a master of all the basic hand weapon types: long blades, short blades, axes, blunt weapons, and spears. I am willing to train with weapons, for a fee.\"\nMajor Skills:\nMinor Skills:\nMerchant.\nMajor Skills:\nMinor Skills:\nBuys and sells:\nMiner.\n\"\"I am a miner. Usually here on Vvardenfell, being a miner means you're an eggminer. Scrib jerky and scrib jelly, kwama eggs and kwama cuttle are the basis of our Vvardenfell economy. Yes, there are more valuable resources we take from mines -- &lt;a href=\"Raw%20Ebony\"&gt;raw ebony&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Raw%20Glass\"&gt;raw glass&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Dreugh%20Wax%20%28Morrowind%29\"&gt;dreugh wax&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Daedra%20Skin%20%28Item%29\"&gt;daedra skin&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Daedra%27s%20Heart%20%28Morrowind%29\"&gt;daedra heart&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Diamond%20%28Morrowind%29\"&gt;diamond&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Ash%20Salts\"&gt;ash salts&lt;/a&gt; and so forth -- and that's good work, too. But it's the eggminers that feed Morrowind, and bring cash from all over the Empire.\"\"\nMajor Skills:\nMinor Skills:\nMonk.\n\"I am a monk. In mind and spirit, I am a student of the hidden mysteries, of the unseen world that lies behind the objects and ideas of everyday life. In body, I am a student of the ancient martial arts, patterned on the 'Rain-of-Sand' fighting styles of Elsweyr. I pursue hand-to-hand and unarmored self-defense, because what you don't have, you cannot lose. I also train with the blunt weapons called staves, because even the poorest peasant can own a staff. To earn my keep, I train others in my skills.\"\nSells:\nNecromancer.\nMajor Skills:\nMinor Skills:\nNightblade.\n\"I am a nightblade. Blending the disciplines of the stealthy agent and subtle wizard, I move unseen and undetected, foil locks and traps, and teleport to safety when threatened, or strike like a viper from ambush. The College of Illusion hides me and fuddles or pacifies my opponents. The College of Mysticism detects my object, reflects and dispels enemy spells, and makes good my escape. The key to a nightblade's success is avoidance, by spell or by stealth; with these skills, all things are possible.\"\nSells:\nNoble.\n\"I am a noble, elevated by birth and distinction to the highest ranks of Imperial society. I do not have a trade, as such, though I may dabble in various affairs, collecting rare treasures of beauty and refinement. And if such things are valuable, there's no harm in it. My lofty station is not without responsibilities, of course. I must serve at the command of the Emperor and the Councils, giving counsel and support, and, when duty calls, taking spell and sword to protect the smallfolk of the Empire.\"\nMajor Skills:\nMinor Skills:\nOrdinator.\n\"We are watching you. Scum.\"\nMajor Skills:\nMinor Skills:\nOrdinator Guard.\nMajor Skills:\nMinor Skills:\nPauper.\n\"I am a pauper, one of the humble smallfolk. I make my way in the world as best I can, laboring in the fields, kitchens, and factories of the Great House lords. When times are good, I live well enough by my own work. When times are hard, I live by the grace and generosity of the clan, and by the charity and good works of the Temple. I am no rude beggar; we are all educated in the Temple, free of charge, and it may be I can teach you something of Morrowind lore.\"\nMajor Skills:\nMinor Skills:\nPawnbroker.\n\"I am a pawnbroker. I buy your goods, giving you cash on the counter, and if, at a later date, you wish to recover your goods, you need only pay me what they are worth -- with a small profit, of course, for my time and trouble. I also sell things, sometimes used and worn, sometimes almost new, and all for a fraction of what they'd cost if purchased elsewhere.\"\nMajor Skills:\nMinor Skills:\nSells item repairs.\nBuys and sells:\nPriest.\n\"\"I am a priest of the &lt;a href=\"Imperial%20Cult\"&gt;Imperial cult&lt;/a&gt;. My role is advocate to the gods on behalf of our cult members. The Imperial cult provides certain benefits for its members at our shrines.\"\"\nMajor Skills:\nMinor Skills:\nProvides healing.\nBuys and sells:\nPublican.\n\"I am a publican. I have food to buy, and beds for lodgers. I also know the neighborhood, and can share the local lore, or, if you prefer, I can give you a little Morrowind lore. I also am likely to have heard the latest rumors, and am happy to share them with you in the spirit of fellowship.\"\nMajor Skills:\nMinor Skills:\nBuys and sells:\nSavant.\n\"I am a savant. I am a woman of wide learning and cosmopolitan tastes, a well-traveled woman, educated, refined in manner, able to converse on various topics with authority, and a woman ever ready to defend her honor, and the honor of my companions. In short, you see before you a gentlewoman. I can discourse upon history, speechcraft, language, and customs. And, for a fee, I offer training that will permit you to share a few of my many virtues.\"\nMajor Skills:\nMinor Skills:\nBuys and sells:\nScout.\n\"I'm a scout. I know places, people, plants, paths, wind, and weather. I serve as guide for travelers and traders, or work as advance guard and pathfinder for expeditions. I know the geography of Vvardenfell, and the various geographic regions. My best defense is stealth, sneaking past trouble, but I can fight bow or blade, in various armor styles, when the job requires it.\"\nSells:\nSharpshooter.\nMajor Skills:\nMinor Skills:\nShipmaster.\n\"I'm a shipmaster. I can transport you by ship to various destinations for a modest fee.\"\nMajor Skills:\nMinor Skills:\nSells:\nSlave.\n\"I am a slave, sera. I serve my owner and master as commanded. I clean, prepare food, fetch and carry, do the shopping and marketing, and do other tasks too tiresome or menial for my master.\"\nMajor Skills:\nMinor Skills:\nSmith.\n\"I am a smith. I make, sell, and repair weapons and armor. I can tell you about the basic armor styles and weapon types. I can also tell you how to take care of worn weapons and worn armor, and sell you the armorer tools you need. I also repair weapons and armor, for a fee.\"\nMajor Skills:\nMinor Skills:\nSells:\nBuys and sells:\nSmuggler.\nMajor Skills:\nMinor Skills:\nThe rank and file often transports illegal trade goods between their sellers and buyers, as in the case of &lt;a href=\"Skooma%20%28Morrowind%29\"&gt;Skooma&lt;/a&gt; and the like. In the case of illegal goods that can be acquired with risk attached, such as &lt;a href=\"Dwemer%20Artifacts\"&gt;Dwemer Artifacts&lt;/a&gt;, low ranking smugglers may be found in &lt;a href=\"Dwemer%20Ruins\"&gt;Dwemer Ruins&lt;/a&gt;. The more senior members of their organizations organize the selling and the buying or other acquisition of such goods.\nSorcerer.\n\"I am a sorcerer. Through my mastery of special disciplines of the College of Conjuration, and my private studies of the Outer Realms and their Powers and Principalities, I have learned to summon and command their denizens to do my bidding. I do these things for coin, or to suit my own interests. I also am an enchanter, enchanting items for my own use and for the use of others. My skill with enchantments also makes me more efficient in using enchanted items that I collect on my research expeditions.\"\nSells:\nThief.\n\"I'm a thief. I was born to be a thief. I love to sneak around in rich people's houses, and liberate their possessions. I enjoy puzzling out the security provisions on doors and chests, thrilling to the challenge and suspense of picking locks and disarming traps. And I've always had an interest in Imperial law -- property rights, criminal justice, bribes and graft. Me and the guards, we're old friends. And punitive labor isn't all that bad -- free food and board, fresh air, and good fellowship.\"\nSells:\nBuys and sells:\nTrader.\n\"I am a trader, a general merchant. I buy and sell a little of everything -- weapons ,armor, clothes, books, miscellaneous items of all kinds. Take a look around; let me know what you want. Or if you have things you'd like to sell, let me take a look at them, and I'll give you a price.\"\nMajor Skills:\nMinor Skills:\nSells:\nBuy and sell:\nWarlock.\nMajor Skills:\nMinor Skills:\n&lt;a href=\"Wise%20Woman\"&gt;Wise Woman&lt;/a&gt;.\n\"I am a wise woman. I am councilor to my Ashlander tribe, guardian of secret knowledge, spirit guide and seer into the world unseen. I can tell you about the ancestors, and about Ashlander customs.\"\nMajor Skills:\nMinor Skills:\nSells:\nBuy and sell:\nWitch.\n\"I'm a witch. I have bound myself by oath and deed to the service of a Daedra lord, and in return have received gifts of knowledge and power. The Temple calls my patrons the bad Daedra, and perhaps they aren't very nice... but I guess I'm not very nice, either. If you are curious, and not afraid, I can tell you a little about the bad Daedra and Daedric summonings.\"\nMajor Skills:\nMinor Skills:"}

This automatic selection, according to the , \"...only reflects what you would probably survive longest as, based upon the way you answered the questions.\", and should only be used as a guideline. The second option is simply selecting a class from a list of eighteen character classes, without any help.\nRace selection.\nThe Champion is shown a map of &lt;a href=\"Tamriel\"&gt;Tamriel&lt;/a&gt;, where they must select a home province. Each province corresponds to the race native to that province. For example, choosing &lt;a href=\"High%20Rock%20%28Arena%29\"&gt;High Rock&lt;/a&gt; makes the Champion a Breton. Each race provides a different bonus as described in &lt;a href=\"Races%20%28Arena%29\"&gt;Races&lt;/a&gt;.\nStat generation.\nThe Champion is then presented with the Character Sheet, or the \"stat-generation screen.\" All stats for every Champion range from 1 to 100, with 50 being the general average for a basic character.

The amount of septims appears to be maximized at 200. If the player is not happy with the random generation, they can reroll the character at any time prior to accepting the character.\nPhysical appearance.\nAfter the stats have been accepted, the Champion may choose their head and hair from a preset list. The choices of head and the rest of the body vary due to their selection of race, sex, and class for their character.

These attributes each govern a particular set of skills. Distributing a high number of points in an attribute means the skill it governs will become more effective. Each attribute allows up to 100 points to be spent on it.\nRaces.\n\"Battlespire\" offers six races for the player to choose from. Each race has unique racial bonuses, which grants them an increase in skills that suit their racial features.\nAltmer.\n\"The tall, golden-skinned High Elves are easily equal to the Bretons in sorcerous ability due to their high intelligence, force of will, and agility. On the one hand, they are more suspectible to spells than the people of High Rock. On the other hand, by their unique nature, they are completely immune to paralyzation.\"\nAltmer, or High Elves, are a tall race of &lt;a href=\"Mer\"&gt;Mer&lt;/a&gt; hailing from the &lt;a href=\"Summerset%20Isles\"&gt;Summerset Isles&lt;/a&gt;. Their skill bonuses grant them an increase in blade and magic-related skills.\nBosmer.\n\"Hailing from the forests of Valenwood, the Wood Elves are the finest archers in all of Tamriel. These cousins of the High Elves and Dark Elves are nimble and quick as the wind. Because of their curious natures and natural agility, Wood Elves often become thieves.\"\nBosmer, or Wood Elves are a race of Mer hailing from the province of &lt;a href=\"Valenwood\"&gt;Valenwood&lt;/a&gt;, in southern &lt;a href=\"Tamriel\"&gt;Tamriel&lt;/a&gt;. Their skill bonuses grant them an increase in throwing and acrobatics-related skills.\nBretons.\n\"Highly intelligent and willful, the Bretons have a natural bond with the forces of magicka. Many great sorcerers have come out of their home province of High Rock, and even the humblest of Breton can boast a high resistance to the destructive powers of magicka.\"\nBretons are a race of half &lt;a href=\"Man\"&gt;Man&lt;/a&gt; and half Mer hailing from the province of &lt;a href=\"High%20Rock\"&gt;High Rock&lt;/a&gt;, in western Tamriel. Their skill bonuses grant them an increase in magic-related skills.\nDunmer.\n\"The dusky, fire-eyed Dark Elves of Morrowind are a strong, intelligent, and quick-footed people. They are legendary sorcerers and warriors, with a prowess with sword and bow rivaling that of the Redguards and Wood Elves.\"\nDunmer, or Dark Elves, are a race of Mer hailing from the province of &lt;a href=\"Morrowind\"&gt;Morrowind&lt;/a&gt; in eastern Tamriel. Their skill bonuses grant them an increase in magic-related skills.\nNords.\n\"The citizens of Skyrim are a tall and fair-haired people. Strong, stubborn, and hardy, Nords are famous for their resistance to cold, even magical frost, and are know [sic] for their prowess as warriors.\"\nNords are a race of Man hailing from the province of &lt;a href=\"Skyrim\"&gt;Skyrim&lt;/a&gt; in northern Tamriel. Their skill bonuses grant them an increase in combat-related skills.\nRedguards.\n\"The most naturally talented warriors in Tamriel, the dark Redguards of Hammerfell seem to have been born for battle. In addition to their affinity for weaponry, Redguards are blessed with hardy constitutions and quickness of foot.\"\nRedguards are a race of Man hailing from the province of &lt;a href=\"Hammerfell\"&gt;Hammerfell&lt;/a&gt;, in western Tamriel. Their skill bonuses grant them in an increase in combat-related skills.\nEquipment.\nA unique feature \"Battlespire\" offers during its character creation is the selection of starting equipment. The player is able to pick gear from a list of items ranging from mithril items to iron items. The item material is selected randomly, mithril being the most valuable material available. Each piece of equipment must be purchased with the 4700 points available.\nThe total cost of the item is calculated through the formula: codice_1\nFrom the same building points, the player is also able to purchase certain magical items. The total magical item cost is calculated through the formula: codice_2\nAdvantages.\nAdvantages are special abilities, perks, and strengths that give the character more power and make the character more effective. Disadvantages are special limitations, restrictions, and weaknesses that balance out the character and provide additional build points to buy skills and abilities.\nAcute Hearing.\nThis advantage allows the character to hear sounds at a greater distance, perhaps warning him or her of nearby danger.\nAdrenaline Rush.\nThis advantage gives the character a burst of increased energy and ability in combat when he or she is near death from a decrease in Wounds level.\nAthleticism.\nAthleticism means the character possesses a high stamina and loses Fatigue Points more slowly while running, swimming, and fighting.\nImmunity.\nThis expensive advantage grants the character Immunity or complete Resistance versus the effects of raw magicka, fire, frost, shock, or poison. If the character has an Immunity to a particular effect, he or she can not have a Low Tolerance or Critical Weakness for the same effect.\nIncrease Magery.\nCharacters with this advantage have greater magicka reserves. Most characters begin with only half their Intelligence in Spell Points. With this advantage, the character can buy up to 1x, 1.5x, 2x, or 3x their Intelligence in Spells [sic] Points.\nRapid Healing.\nCharacters with this advantage recover lost Wound points more quickly.\nRegenerate Health.\nCharacters with this costly advantage automatically regain lost health over time.\nRegenerate SP's.\nCharacters with this advantage automatically regain lost Spell Points over time.\nResistance.\nThis advantage grants the character increased Resistance versus damage and other harmful effects caused by raw magicka, fire, frost, shock, or poison. If the character has a Resistance to a particular effect, he or she can not have a similar Low Tolerance or Critical Weakness to the same effect.\nSpell Absorption.\nSpell Absorption grants the character a chance to automatically absorb the magicka of a spell cast at him or her and add the Spell Points to his or her own reserves. However, if the character's magicka reserve is full, he or she can not absorb the spell and suffers the effects of the spell.\nDisadvantages.\nBy default, no Disadvantages are applied when creating a new class.\nNo Regeneration of SP's.\nThis disadvantage means the character does not regenerate spent magicka. The character's spell casting abilities are severely limited. However, Spell Points may be replenished with magicka absorption spells and abilities.\nForbidden Armor.\nCharacters with this disadvantage can not use or equip any armor of a higher class than the one indicated. (For example, a character restricted to Light armor can not use Medium or Heavy armor).\nForbidden Material.\nCharacters with this disadvantage can not use or equip any item of better material than the material indicated. (For example, a character restricted to Mithril material can not use or equip items of Adamantium, Ebony, Orchish [sic], or Daedric Material).\nForbidden Weapons.\nCharacters with this disadvantage can not use or equip certain types of weapons.\nLow Tolerance.\nThis disadvantage means the character suffers increased damage or effect from raw magicka, fire, frost, shock, or poison. If the character has a Low Tolerance to an effect, he or she can not have a Resistance or Immunity to the same effect.\nCritical Weakness.\nThis dangerous disadvantage means the character is highly vulnerable to the effects of raw magicka, fire, frost, shock, or poison. The character suffers a chance of being extremely hurt or even killed by the effect. If the character has a Critical Weakness to an effect, he or she can not have a Resistance or Immunity to the same effect."}

The racial special abilities can either be passive, which are inherent effects, or an active spell that can be temporarily cast, such as &lt;a href=\"Voice%20of%20the%20Emperor%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;Voice of the Emperor&lt;/a&gt;. Passive abilities are typically resistances or vulnerabilities to spells or illness, or are bonuses of increased &lt;a href=\"Magicka%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;Magicka&lt;/a&gt;.\nSkill gains are over 1.5 times more effective than Strength and Agility attribute gains in increasing combat damage.\nSelecting a birthsign.\nAfter leaving and then rejoining the &lt;a href=\"Uriel%20Septim%20VII\"&gt;Emperor&lt;/a&gt;'s party for a bit of &lt;a href=\"Combat%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;combat&lt;/a&gt; tutorials, selecting a birthsign is the second step of character creation. Each of the &lt;a href=\"Birthsigns%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;thirteen birthsigns&lt;/a&gt;\u00a0add\u00a0additional unique bonuses to a character, some passive and some active. Some are pure bonuses, while others are trade-offs in which one powerful bonus is countered with one or more negative effects. Most active skills granted by a birthsign can only be used once a day.\nSelecting a class.\nClass selection occurs almost at the end of the Imperial Subterrane, once the player has made it through the tutorial &lt;a href=\"Natural%20Caverns\"&gt;Natural Caverns&lt;/a&gt;. After the assassination of the &lt;a href=\"Uriel%20Septim%20VII\"&gt;Emperor&lt;/a&gt;, based on how one played through the Natural Caverns underneath the prison, &lt;a href=\"Baurus\"&gt;Baurus&lt;/a&gt; suggest which of the 21 pre-made classes would suit one's strategy best. After the suggestion, the class selection screen opens. The differences between classes are.\nMain Attributes\nMajor skills are important for three reasons:\nA player may also create their own class for complete control over how they wish their character to develop.\nCustom Class and leveling.\nTwo things are necessary to consider when choosing Major and Minor skills. One is, that some skills are used very often, such as combat skills or Restoration or Athletics, thereby leveling the character if they are chosen as Major skills. The player is urged to consider the impact of these skills leveling very fast. Not only does this lead to imperfect amounts of Attributes being gained, but the monsters throughout the game will be of higher level, while the player's power has not increased evenly. So the player is faced with the task of increasing their power, which comes from skills, while raising level, which increases their enemies' skills, as little as possible. The most effective way to do this is to raise the combat skills. Combat skill gains are over 1.5 times more effective than Strength and Agility attribute gains in increasing combat damage. Moreover, three of the combat skills are based on Strength, which has five skills in total. Because there are two 'extra' skills, at least two of them can be raised without any regard to accumulating Attribute points.\nAlthough the bonuses to Major skills will make a skill \"easier\" to level, because there is no danger of leveling too quickly with Minor skills, they can be raised to 100 as soon as possible. So, counter-intuitively, skills that the player desires to be powerful not only in the long run but also to a lesser extent, sooner, can be made Minor. These skills can be used as often as the player wants and raised as high as the player wants, with no concern for leveling problems.\nOften-used skills.\nDetermining what skills will be used the most, and for what purpose, is helpful in determining the allocation of Major and Minor categories.\nOptional skills.\nGaining the maximum attribute bonus from each level helps to a small extent in maintaining a powerful character in a game where all monsters become more powerful as one's character gains levels, rather than a few powerful monsters being located somewhere that can be avoided until the character is ready to face them. In order to stay stronger than the monsters, it is necessary to level at will, rather than by accident; this can be expedited by intentionally avoiding picking major skills that are uncontrollably leveled, such as Athletics, and choosing instead those for which there are substitutes.\nEven Blade, for example, can be an optional skill, because Axe, Blunt, Destruction, Hand to Hand, or Marksman can be used instead to avoid level-up. The skills most likely to level up out of control, gaining the tenth Major skill increase before the ten Major/Minor increases in each of the attributes of choice, are the aforementioned Athletics, and Restoration. Mercantile is effectively uncontrollable in \"Oblivion\" (it levels, albeit slowly, whenever the player makes a transaction, where in \"Morrowind\" it only did so when the player modified the buying or selling price).\nMajor skills that are crucial to the completion of quests can require being ready with a substitute, e.g., Alteration unlocking spells can be used instead of Security, to get past locks that block critical paths in quests or irreplaceable loot, and Charm spells or scrolls can be used instead of Persuasion, when quests require soft-talking a NPC, or taking time out from quests to level up. For more on the importance of gaining maximum attribute bonuses and the means to achieve them, (see &lt;a href=\"Leveling\"&gt;Leveling&lt;/a&gt;). Keeping level low while exploring &lt;a href=\"Cyrodiil\"&gt;Cyrodiil&lt;/a&gt; also maximizes opportunities to obtain the best available equipment.\nNPC smiths can be used to repair armor, dodging backwards can be used to avoid enemy blows (incidentally, a 100% damage reduction), and light armor, leveled concurrently, can be used if leveling heavy armor is not desired. These are not, of course, the most optional of skills, nor preferred options; the point is that it is only \"having\" to level a particular Major skill that leads to uncontrolled character leveling, not the fact that the player \"might\" use it.\nDrawbacks of this strategy include: it is time consuming at low levels (although this is to be weighed against the savings in time of easier fights at higher level), and one's character's key survival skills all start at novice level, making for a steeper learning curve (to be weighed against the benefits of an easier mid- and late-game)."}

First the player chooses the race, which corresponds to a set faction, unless the player has pre-ordered. Only those who have pre-ordered the game can choose any race in any faction, and only those who have pre-ordered the Imperial Edition, can play as the Imperial race. Secondly, the player choose a class, followed by the customization of the character like body posture, tattoos, hair, facial hair, horns or markings, depending on the race and sex.\nAlong the making of the character, the player may choose to display novice gear or veteran gear to see the look of the character with the armor, or no gear at all to see the body markings.\nRace and Faction.\nBoth genders can be played of any race. The playable factions from left to right and races from top to bottom from the picture: if pre-ordered all factions are allowed with any race.\nClass.\nThe player can choose between &lt;a href=\"Dragonknight\"&gt;Dragonknight&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Sorcerer%20%28Online%20Class%29\"&gt;Sorcerer&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Nightblade%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Nightblade&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Templar\"&gt;Templar&lt;/a&gt;, and with the release of , &lt;a href=\"Warden\"&gt;Warden&lt;/a&gt; classes. Different icons represent the classes in that order, plus a short description for each class. (see picture)\nBody.\nThe player can choose from a wide variety of body features to customize. The first triangle helps the player get started and make the foundation for the overall character, going from \"Thin,\" \"Large,\" and \"Muscular.\"\nSkin color varies from race to race to remain true to the lore. Argonians can have blue and green skin, while Altmers can only have yellow-brown colors. Body markings is also unique to each race, with some exceptions. Sliders can be used to decide height, torso size (chest width), chest size, gut size (stomach size - \"fatness\"), waist size (width), arm size, hand size, hip size, posterior size (butt size), leg size and foot size.\nFace.\nJust like the body, most of the face can be customized. A similar triangle is presented to help with the foundation of the character. The choices here are \"Heroic,\" \"Angular,\" or \"Soft.\"\nHair and eye color can be chosen, along with preferred voice to the character (ranging from soft and young, to old and rough). Hair styles, face markings and adornment (facial hair, earrings, and piercings) are more or less unique to each race. Age can also be chosen for face complexion. Further down the sliders are used to decide forehead slope, cheekbone size, cheekbone height, jaw size, chin size, chin height, neck size, eye size, eye angle, eye separation, eye height, eye squint, eyebrow height, eyebrow skew, eyebrow depth, nose slope, nose height, nose width, nose length, mouth height, mouth curve, lip fullness.\nName.\nFinally, after race, sex, faction, class, body and face is decided, the character needs a name. Because of the Elder Scrolls universe, there are great liberties to how the player may write the character name. The requirements are shown in the picture to the right, additional to the requirement of at least 3 characters, and can be no shorter.\nMany decide to find an appropriate, lore-correct name. Nords may have more Norse names, while Imperials have more Roman-like names. To find appropriate names, or names of already known people of the desired race, one can read about each races lore on any wiki page, for ideas.\nMany MMO's also enforces strictly non-use of curse words or sexually-related words in their character name. This has yet to be confirmed as for ZeniMax's part, but is highly advised against."}

With , the class system has been removed, and character creation determines very little about the capabilities of a character. The only aspects which the player will choose are &lt;a href=\"Races%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;race&lt;/a&gt;, gender, appearance, and name.\nThe process is thus centered almost entirely on the aesthetic aspect of character creation, which has been greatly improved over past games. Players can now edit facial features in much greater detail, and add decorations like war paint, facial hair, battle scars, wrinkles, and dirt coverage.\nNotably absent are &lt;a href=\"birthsign\"&gt;birthsign&lt;/a&gt;s. Instead, Skyrim has added &lt;a href=\"Standing%20Stones\"&gt;Standing Stones&lt;/a&gt;, which are monoliths found throughout Skyrim that functionally replace both birthsigns and &lt;a href=\"Doomstone\"&gt;Doomstone&lt;/a&gt;s. They can be activated at any time once the player discovers them, and confer various bonuses, such as increasing experience gained for certain skill types, or buffing stats. Only one can be active at once (unless one uses the &lt;a href=\"Aetherial%20Crown\"&gt;Aetherial Crown&lt;/a&gt;). &lt;a href=\"The%20Warrior%20Stone%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;The Warrior&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"The%20Mage%20Stone%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Mage&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"The%20Thief%20Stone%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Thief&lt;/a&gt; Standing Stones, which boost experience gained for skills associated with each archetype, can be found on the way to the first objective after the game's intro mission.\nCustomize.\nAfter choosing one of the ten racial options, the following aspects can be customized:\nOf note to many players is that the character creation screen is brighter than most areas of the game, which may result in some features looking darker in the actual game than intended. This can be (slightly) alleviated by pausing the game, before naming the Prisoner, and looking through the smokescreen of the start menu.\nThe character's face and body may be altered by &lt;a href=\"Galathil\"&gt;Galathil&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"The%20Ragged%20Flagon\"&gt;The Ragged Flagon&lt;/a&gt; on for 1000 if has been installed. However, she cannot change the character's name, race, or gender, and she cannot alter vampires at all.\nRace selection.\nThe first thing that must be chosen is the &lt;a href=\"Last%20Dragonborn\"&gt;Dragonborn&lt;/a&gt;'s race. Each race starts with special bonuses to different &lt;a href=\"Skills%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Skills&lt;/a&gt;. Additionally, each race has special abilities. The racial abilities can either be passive characteristics, such as &lt;a href=\"Argonians%20%28Skyrim%29%23Special%20abilities\"&gt;Waterbreathing&lt;/a&gt;, or &lt;a href=\"Greater%20Power\"&gt;Greater Power&lt;/a&gt;s that can be used once per day, such as &lt;a href=\"Bosmer%20%28Skyrim%29%23Special%20abilities\"&gt;Command Animal&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe Dragonborn can be &lt;a href=\"Nords%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Nord&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Imperials%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Imperial&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Redguards%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Redguard&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Bretons%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Breton&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Argonians%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Argonian&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Khajiit%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Khajiit&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Dunmer%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Dunmer&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Altmer%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Altmer&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Bosmer%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Bosmer&lt;/a&gt;, or &lt;a href=\"Orsimer%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Orsimer&lt;/a&gt;.\nBonuses.\nNord:\nImperial:\nRedguard:\nBreton:\nArgonian:\nKhajiit:\nDark Elf (Dunmer):\nHigh Elf (Altmer):\nWood Elf (Bosmer):\nOrc (Orsimer):\nGuide.\nDue to the lack of specializations or birthsigns, the starting differences in skill values for each race are only relevant early in the game. Players wishing to specialize in a given skill can quickly make up for a disadvantaged score through consistent use, especially if aided by Standing Stone experience bonuses. That said, for players who want to choose an appropriate race for RP or leveling efficiency purposes, there are clear ways to categorize each race according to play style.\nEach race starts with bonuses to six skills, including one bonus of +10, which represents the race's most significant skill. These bonuses allow the races to be sorted by proficiency into the three primary play-styles, &lt;a href=\"The%20Warrior%20Stone%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Warrior&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"The%20Mage%20Stone%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Mage&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"The%20Thief%20Stone%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Thief&lt;/a&gt;:\nAnother important factor is racial bonuses, which are permanent, and may be a significant deciding factor in a player's race/class decision. Most racial bonuses have general utility to any character type, but some are clearly geared toward one playstyle more than others. These can be used to augment a chosen playstyle, or cover weaknesses when the need arises for skills the player rarely uses."}
{"id": "17514", "revid": "25646820", "url": "https://elderscrolls.fandom.com/wiki?curid=17514", "title": "Character Level", "text": "Character Level is a statistic denoting the strength of the player character, NPCs, and &lt;a href=\"Creatures\"&gt;hostile entities&lt;/a&gt;. The most rudimentary level is 1, while the maximum level differs across games in series. Non-native to \"The Elder Scrolls\", character level is a game term across &lt;a href=\"role-playing%20games\"&gt;role-playing games&lt;/a&gt;. Level increases upon being awarded experience points (colloquially referred to as \"XP\"). Experience points are awarded by &lt;a href=\"Quest\"&gt;completing tasks&lt;/a&gt; outlined by Characters or by killing hostile foes. In \"The Elder Scrolls\", character level increases on a 1 by 1 basis each time a certain quota of &lt;a href=\"skill\"&gt;skill&lt;/a&gt; levels are achieved. Skills, alternatively, are leveled by performing actions governed by the skill. For example, &lt;a href=\"Security%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;Security&lt;/a&gt; in increases when &lt;a href=\"Lock%20Level\"&gt;locks&lt;/a&gt; are successfully picked or when &lt;a href=\"Lockpick%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;lockpicks&lt;/a&gt; break. &lt;a href=\"Magic\"&gt;Magic&lt;/a&gt;, such as &lt;a href=\"Alteration\"&gt;Alteration&lt;/a&gt;, can cause level up when a certain number of Alteration spells, such as &lt;a href=\"Feather\"&gt;Feather&lt;/a&gt;, are cast. The same rings true for &lt;a href=\"combat\"&gt;combat&lt;/a&gt; and all other skills.\nLeveled items and creatures.\nLevel determines the strength and power of the creatures and items found on &lt;a href=\"Tamriel\"&gt;Tamriel&lt;/a&gt;. For example, characters of level 26 or above are more inclined to encounter &lt;a href=\"Dremora%20Markynaz\"&gt;Dremora Markynaz&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Oblivion%20Gate%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;Oblivion Gates&lt;/a&gt;, than &lt;a href=\"Clannfear%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;Clannfear&lt;/a&gt;. Some enemies, such as &lt;a href=\"Scamp%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;Scamps&lt;/a&gt;, will not appear in the world at all after reaching a certain level.\nCombat items such as &lt;a href=\"armor\"&gt;armor&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"weapons\"&gt;weapons&lt;/a&gt; increase in value and protection rating based on level as well. For example, &lt;a href=\"Kud-Ei\"&gt;Kud-Ei&lt;/a&gt;, a member of the &lt;a href=\"Mages%20Guild%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;Mages Guild&lt;/a&gt;, is a &lt;a href=\"spellsword\"&gt;spellsword&lt;/a&gt;. At low levels, she wields a standard &lt;a href=\"Steel%20Longsword%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;steel longsword&lt;/a&gt;, but as character level increases, her sword level also increases, raising to &lt;a href=\"Elven%20Longsword%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;elven&lt;/a&gt; and eventually &lt;a href=\"Daedric%20Longsword%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;Daedric&lt;/a&gt;. Thus, if armor and weapons of Daedric quality are desired, the character level must be raised before they appear in the world.\nThe higher level a character is, the more likely that quests with leveled loot will offer more . Certain magical items are leveled, meaning the magnitude of their &lt;a href=\"Enchanting%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;enchantments&lt;/a&gt; increases the higher level the person who discovered them is.\nDifficulty.\nAs characters level up, foes become noticeably more difficult. Manually adjusting the &lt;a href=\"Difficulty\"&gt;Difficulty&lt;/a&gt; slider to bring the game back in line with the character is an optional solution. A solution in is to use the &lt;a href=\"Console%20Commands%20%28Skyrim%29%23player.setlevel_X\"&gt;codice_1&lt;/a&gt; command.\nFor example, if level 12 is reached by overly using non-combat skills, while combat skills are left at level 10 or lower, the console commands can be used to enter: codice_2. This resets the difficulty level back to something appropriate for a 10th level character. Otherwise, foes will be at level 12 appropriateness, while the character is only suited for level 10 combat.\nGaining levels.\nArena.\nAs you adventure in the land, you will gain experience. At certain times when enough experience is gained, you will also gain a level. Gaining a level results in stat increases, health increases, and improved abilities. As a rough guide Bethesda released this table with the game manual. It is also worth noting that the main classes (such as a warrior) require less experience points to level up than their sub classes (such as a knight) while these are small at lower levels the gap gets quite large as the levels progress. The following table shows the experience required for leveling up:\nMorrowind.\nWhen a character increases any Minor or Major &lt;a href=\"Skills%20%28Morrowind%29\"&gt;skill&lt;/a&gt; ten times a level is gained. This can be performed by using said skills, or retaining the services of a &lt;a href=\"Trainers%20%28Morrowind%29\"&gt;skill trainer&lt;/a&gt;. Any combination of these skills can be increased for a level-up, be it the same skill ten times, five skills two times, etc. A message to \"rest and meditate on what you've learned\" is received, and the character must &lt;a href=\"Rest%23Morrowind\"&gt;sleep&lt;/a&gt; soundly in a bed, or deep in the wilderness far away from any settlements in order to receive the level-up interface. &lt;a href=\"Wait\"&gt;Wait&lt;/a&gt;ing is not sufficient for this to occur.\nIn the level-up interface, the character's &lt;a href=\"attribute\"&gt;attribute&lt;/a&gt;s are displayed and can be increased. These frequently have multipliers, which are assigned based on the number of times an attribute's governing skills have been increased since the last level-up, up to a maximum of 5\u00d7. Minor, Major, and Miscellaneous skill increases contribute to the determination of the multipliers. &lt;a href=\"Luck%20%28Morrowind%29\"&gt;Luck&lt;/a&gt; can never have a multiplier because it does not govern any skills.\nThe character also gains &lt;a href=\"Health%20%28Morrowind%29\"&gt;Health&lt;/a&gt; with every level-up. It is increased by amount equal to ten percent of the character's &lt;a href=\"Endurance%20%28Morrowind%29\"&gt;Endurance&lt;/a&gt;, including any Endurance gained during the current level-up. Endurance bonuses from magical effects or &lt;a href=\"Enchant%20%28Morrowind%29\"&gt;enchantments&lt;/a&gt; are not considered.\nOblivion.\nIn , a character gains a level after a total of 10 &lt;a href=\"Skills%20%28Oblivion%29%23Major%20skills\"&gt;major skill&lt;/a&gt; increases, since they last gained a level. These increases can be spread across any number of these major skills. For example, increasing the &lt;a href=\"Blade\"&gt;Blade&lt;/a&gt; skill five times, the &lt;a href=\"Block%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;Block&lt;/a&gt; skill two times, and the &lt;a href=\"Heavy%20Armor%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;Heavy Armor&lt;/a&gt; skill three times results in a total of ten skill increases. The character then receives a notice to meditate and &lt;a href=\"Rest%23Oblivion\"&gt;rest&lt;/a&gt; (sleep), so that he or she may gain a level and distribute &lt;a href=\"Attributes%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;attribute&lt;/a&gt; points. If this meditation notice is accidentally overlooked, a moon with an arrow pointing up to the left appears next to the compass, indicating that a level up can occur. Level ups stack if they are not taken right away, causing the player to level up multiple times upon next sleeping.\nOptimizing leveling.\nTo optimize leveling, increase skills that match the &lt;a href=\"Classes%20%28Oblivion%29%23Specialization\"&gt;class specialization&lt;/a&gt; chosen at &lt;a href=\"Character%20Creation%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;character creation&lt;/a&gt;, that match the main attributes for that class, and that are major skills selected for that class. For example, &lt;a href=\"Destruction%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;Destruction&lt;/a&gt;, based on the &lt;a href=\"Intelligence%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;Intelligence&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Attributes%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;attribute&lt;/a&gt;, falls under the &lt;a href=\"Magic\"&gt;Magic&lt;/a&gt; specialization. So, a character, that choose intelligence as a main attribute, magic as a specialization, and Destruction as a major skill requires less casting experience to receive skill levels in Destruction, making leveling up easier. To be specific, only 45% of the base experience is required before skill advancement. Of the seven &lt;a href=\"Combat\"&gt;Combat&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Magic\"&gt;Magic&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Stealth\"&gt;Stealth&lt;/a&gt; skills chosen for a class, only 75% of the experience needed to level up is required. For the major skills chosen for the class, only 60% is needed. Skills not falling under the specializing, attributes, or major skills take the longest to level up because they, by logic, need the most experience.\nSome players prefer to use a reverse tactic, instead of choosing major skills that correspond with ones that will be used most often during game play, ones that are used least often are selected instead, so that better control of leveling up can be gained, allowing for creatures to be easier. The downside is that the loot is weaker and the player must increase cross-class skills in order to augment difficulty and improve item drops.\nA third strategy is to note that there are seven attributes (excluding &lt;a href=\"Luck%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;Luck&lt;/a&gt; which governs no skills) and seven major skills, so picking one skill that is governed by each attribute ensures that no attribute fails to progress. It is important to note that all attributes have benefits for all classes. For example, mages benefit from increased &lt;a href=\"Strength%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;Strength&lt;/a&gt; (nominally a warrior attribute) in terms of increased carrying capacity and warriors obtain magical resistance from increased &lt;a href=\"Willpower%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;Willpower&lt;/a&gt;, which is nominally a magical attribute.\nAttribute and stat increase.\nWhen one skill has been leveled ten times or more during one level progression, it is possible that certain attributes can be increased by five increments, which is the largest of the game. For example, casting &lt;a href=\"Illusion%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;Illusion&lt;/a&gt; spells and leveling that spell for the majority of one level allows &lt;a href=\"Personality%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;Personality&lt;/a&gt;, Illusion's governing attribute, to be raised by +5. This works on a sliding scale. The more a specific skill is leveled per level, the more attribute points the character can add to that skills governing attribute, ranging from +1 (the least used skills) to +5 (the most used skills). Only three attributes can be increased per level up. Once all attributes are maxed out, no more levels can be gained. So gaining attribute modifiers of +5 may not be beneficial.\nNote that minor and major skills count towards which attributes increase, major skills determine when. For example, assume that an agility minor skill went up during a level in which personality and strength major skills went up by a total of ten levels. Then, the resulting attribute increases would be divided among personality, strength, and agility.\n&lt;a href=\"Health%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;Health&lt;/a&gt; increases by 10% of the &lt;a href=\"Endurance%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;Endurance&lt;/a&gt; attribute, rounded down. From empirical data, it seems that this gain (the bonus 10%) is not retroactively calculated with future Endurance increases. However, increases in Endurance will retroactively add to your base health (2x Endurance). &lt;a href=\"Magicka%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;Magicka&lt;/a&gt; gain is identical, but is calculated by &lt;a href=\"Intelligence%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;Intelligence&lt;/a&gt;, while &lt;a href=\"Willpower\"&gt;Willpower&lt;/a&gt; governs the rate by which &lt;a href=\"Regenerate%20Magicka\"&gt;magicka regenerates&lt;/a&gt; in real time, unless otherwise impeded by outside skills and abilities such as by selecting &lt;a href=\"The%20Atronach\"&gt;The Atronach&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Birthsigns%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;birthsign&lt;/a&gt;.\nSkyrim.\nIn , leveling functions much the same, except &lt;a href=\"attributes\"&gt;attributes&lt;/a&gt; and classes have been eradicated. &lt;a href=\"Character%20level%20calculation%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Character level is determined solely on skill levels&lt;/a&gt;. No shortcuts or experience point discounts are awarded for having &lt;a href=\"Major%20skill\"&gt;major&lt;/a&gt; skills or specializations since the class system no longer exists. These discounts are, instead, given by the &lt;a href=\"Guardian%20Stones\"&gt;Guardian Stones&lt;/a&gt; (discounted skills depending on a chosen stone - Thief, Warrior or Mage), &lt;a href=\"the%20Lover%20Stone%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;the Lover Stone&lt;/a&gt; (which provides a lower discount than that of the three primary Guardian Stones but all skills are included) and by being &lt;a href=\"Rested\"&gt;Rested&lt;/a&gt;,\u00a0&lt;a href=\"Well%20Rested\"&gt;Well Rested&lt;/a&gt;\u00a0or having &lt;a href=\"Lover%27s%20Comfort\"&gt;Lover's Comfort&lt;/a&gt; which gives a 5%, 10% and 15% bonus respectively.\nAdditionally, instead of requiring rest, sleep, or meditation to increase character level, it occurs instantly. Simply follow the prompts on the screen, select which of the three statistics to raise (&lt;a href=\"Stamina%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Stamina&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Health%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Health&lt;/a&gt;, or &lt;a href=\"Magicka%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Magicka&lt;/a&gt;), then allocate &lt;a href=\"Perks%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;perks&lt;/a&gt; to whichever skill tree the player wishes to advance. This can even be done in combat, and will refill whichever statistic is raised upon level-up, giving the potential to use a level-up as a means of recovery during a fight.\nEven though Skyrim's level cap was removed as of version 1.9, the hard limit is actually level 65,535 (Hex number FFFF). Attempting to level past this point crashes the game due to the value overflowing back to zero.\nLevel up messages.\nIn \"Morrowind\" and \"Oblivion\", messages will appear after resting and leveling up."}

Food and ingredients include items harvested around &lt;a href=\"Skyrim\"&gt;Skyrim&lt;/a&gt;.\nSuggested upgrades.\nA hollow white triangle is displayed to the right of any weapons (excluding staves) or apparel (excluding jewelry) that is considered to be the best item \"of its type\" in the player's inventory.

Of special note, head armor is additionally classified into &lt;a href=\"Light%20Armor%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;light&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Heavy%20Armor%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;heavy&lt;/a&gt; when being considered as a suggested upgrade.\nMagic.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Magic\"&gt;Magic&lt;/a&gt; tab includes the available &lt;a href=\"Spells%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Spells&lt;/a&gt; to the player. There is a category for each school, over the submenus \"all\" and \"favorites.\" This section also shows all learned &lt;a href=\"Dragon%20Shouts\"&gt;Dragon Shouts&lt;/a&gt;. The magic tab also is where the player unlocks shouts and keeps track of &lt;a href=\"Dragon%20Soul\"&gt;dragon souls&lt;/a&gt; taken. Lastly, this tab is where can find their active effects, including any &lt;a href=\"Diseases%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;diseases&lt;/a&gt; they might have.\nFavorites.\nFavorited items or spells will be marked with an asterisk and Equipped items will be marked with an arrow. After an item or spell is Favorited, it can be quickly accessed from a list of all the Favorites using the \"Q\" button on PC or holding up or down on the Xbox and the PS3 D-pad.\nFavorited items can also be bound to the number keys. This can be done by opening the Favorites menu and pressing a number key. The selected favorite can then be quickly equipped by pressing the number key that the item/spell was bound to.\nFor PS3 and Xbox's users, holding left or right on the D-pad in Favorite list will at \"1\" and \"2\" (respectively) next to the items' names. Pressing left or right will make the Dragonborn use the marked items in real-time. Spells and weapons also can be marked this way, but it may take times to fully understand which spells/equipment will go to which hands.\nFor example: 1. Fast Healing and 2. Firebolt.\nPressing left D-pad once will add Fast Healing to the left hand. Pressing it once more will add another Fast Healing to the right hand. Same with Firebolt but with the right D-pad.\nTo add both spells to each hand (left Fast Healing and right Firebolt). Press right, right, left.\nOne-handed weapons will always be equipped to the right hand unless the Dragonborn has more than one of the same weapons for dual-wielding. This also true for default left hand items such as shields and torch.\nMarking a combination of Health, Magicka, or Stamina Potions will make it easier to use them whenever needed without going into the Favorite list.\nSkills.\nIn the &lt;a href=\"Skills%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Skills&lt;/a&gt; menu, the player \"looks to the stars.\" The player then scrolls across and can choose between all the skills (magic colleges, classes e.t.c). When the player gains skill points, they may choose one of the many &lt;a href=\"Perks%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Perks&lt;/a&gt; if they have level or more points than the required skill points.\nAs the player chooses perks, a Constellation appears.\nMap.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Map\"&gt;Map&lt;/a&gt; in \"Skyrim\" zooms out from your current position and is used to access the journal. The triggers zoom in and out when the map is accessed and the \"A\" (Xbox 360) or \"X\" (old model) or \"O\" (slim model) buttons are used to place waypoints. The start button accesses the journal and \"X\" (Xbox 360) or \"square\" (PS3) enters the local map. While on PC, the \"M\" key pulls up the map, with \"W,\" \"S,\" \"D,\" and \"A,\" allowing the player to move around. The mouse-wheel zooms in and out of the map."}

If these characters are attacked, they will fall to their knees and surrender when they get near zero Health. After a short time, they will rise up with full health, and will reengage the attacker until they are killed or are no longer in their zone.\nThe following is a list pertaining to such NPCs:\nGeneral characters.\nThere are also many general NPCs in Skyrim, many of which are randomly generated.

These spells are more beneficial than the ones that last longer and are sold by merchants. Even if the spell lasts for one second, the duration-counter pauses when an NPC is initiated in dialogue. This is advantageous for quests that require high &lt;a href=\"disposition\"&gt;disposition&lt;/a&gt; or for purchasing &lt;a href=\"Houses%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;homes&lt;/a&gt; from the &lt;a href=\"Steward\"&gt;Steward&lt;/a&gt;s of &lt;a href=\"Count\"&gt;Count&lt;/a&gt;s and Countesses, virtually rendering &lt;a href=\"Speechcraft%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;Speechcraft&lt;/a&gt; useless.\nWhen combined with a Fortify Mercantile spell with a magnitude of 100, it ensures haggling with merchants is excessively easy. Cast the charm/mercantile spell on a merchant and immediately enter dialogue with them. Click \"haggle\" and raise the price to maximum, and the merchant will purchase whatever is sold to them, every time, at a much higher price than normal. Combine this type of spell effect with &lt;a href=\"Fortify%20Personality%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;Fortify Personality&lt;/a&gt; for added ease and gold output."}

The Hero manages to fight off the bandits and saves the inhabitants of Azra's Crossing from Delfran, the leader of the bandits. Inside &lt;a href=\"Delfran%27s%20Hideout\"&gt;Delfran's Hideout&lt;/a&gt;, the Hero finds &lt;a href=\"Skelos%20Undriel\"&gt;Skelos Undriel&lt;/a&gt;, a shadowmage who tells them that more may be at stake, as well as a &lt;a href=\"Shadowkey\"&gt;Shadowkey&lt;/a&gt;, a strange artifact that can be used to open &lt;a href=\"Shadowgates\"&gt;Shadowgates&lt;/a&gt;.\n&lt;a href=\"Collect%20Five%20Star%20Teeth\"&gt;Collect Five Star Teeth&lt;/a&gt;.\nBack at Azra's Crossing, Skelos informs the Hero that he is being hunted by &lt;a href=\"Jagar%20Tharn\"&gt;Jagar Tharn&lt;/a&gt;, and that he needs a place to hide until he is safe. After the Hero clears &lt;a href=\"Earthtear%20Caverns%20%28Shadowkey%29\"&gt;Earthtear Caverns&lt;/a&gt; to use as a hideout, they are told that someone is using the ongoing &lt;a href=\"War%20of%20Bend%27r-Mahk\"&gt;War of Bend'r-Mahk&lt;/a&gt; to create a powerful entity known as the &lt;a href=\"Umbra%27%20Keth\"&gt;Umbra' Keth&lt;/a&gt;, also known as the Shadow of Conflict. Skelos urges the Hero to realize that this entity must not fall in to the hands of Jagar or any other mages of his kind, for it could mean disaster for &lt;a href=\"Tamriel\"&gt;Tamriel&lt;/a&gt;.\nFortunately for the Hero, Skelos tells them of a solution; together, they must find the five &lt;a href=\"Star%20Teeth\"&gt;Star Teeth&lt;/a&gt;, enchanted crystals with the ability to fight &lt;a href=\"Shadow%20Magic\"&gt;Shadow Magic&lt;/a&gt;. Skelos tells the Hero their location, and they then go off to retrieve them. Travelling to &lt;a href=\"Ghast%27s%20Pass\"&gt;Ghast's Pass&lt;/a&gt;, the Hero finds &lt;a href=\"the%20Witch%20Tree\"&gt;the Witch Tree&lt;/a&gt;, a sentient tree in possession of one of the Star Teeth. The tree says that three tasks must be completed before the Hero can be given the Star Tooth: the first task is to save &lt;a href=\"Olpac%20Trailslag\"&gt;Olpac Trailslag&lt;/a&gt; from two &lt;a href=\"Zombie%20%28Shadowkey%29\"&gt;zombies&lt;/a&gt;, the second task is to find the cameo of &lt;a href=\"Rene%20Violet\"&gt;Rene Violet&lt;/a&gt;'s mother and return it to Rene, and the third and final task is to retrieve the Shadowkey residing within &lt;a href=\"Twilight%20Temple\"&gt;Twilight Temple&lt;/a&gt;.\nInside the Twilight Temple, the Hero finds &lt;a href=\"Pergan%20Asuul\"&gt;Pergan Asuul&lt;/a&gt;, a powerful shadowmage looking to control the Umbra' Keth. Once Pergan is defeated, he tells the Hero that they will fight two more times. The Shadowkey is taken from Pergan Asuul and taken to the Witch Tree, with that, the tree finally presents the first Star Tooth.\nThe Hero travels all over the region, finding the other Star Teeth. The Hero finds &lt;a href=\"Porliss%20Caith\"&gt;Porliss Caith&lt;/a&gt;, an agent of Hammerfell, who holds one of the Star Teeth; they also find &lt;a href=\"Tanyin%20Aldwyr\"&gt;Tanyin Aldwyr&lt;/a&gt;, an agent of Skyrim; &lt;a href=\"Perosius\"&gt;Perosius&lt;/a&gt;, an assassin in hiding; and &lt;a href=\"Lakvan\"&gt;Lakvan&lt;/a&gt;, a bandit leader with a strong connection to Jagar Tharn. Inside &lt;a href=\"Lakvan%27s%20Stronghold\"&gt;Lakvan's Stronghold&lt;/a&gt; the Hero finds Pergan Asuul once more. Pergan exclaims that &lt;a href=\"Azra%20Nightwielder\"&gt;Azra Nightwielder&lt;/a&gt;, the first ever Shadowmage, lingers in &lt;a href=\"Fearfrost%20Caverns\"&gt;Fearfrost Caverns&lt;/a&gt;. The Hero defeats Asuul once again and travels to Fearfrost Caverns.\n&lt;a href=\"Find%20Azra%20Nightwielder\"&gt;Find Azra Nightwielder&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe Hero reaches the Fearfrost Caverns, where a large crystal lies. As the Hero approaches, the crystal reacts to the proximity of their Shadowkeys, and breaks open. Inside the crystal resides a mage, who appears to have amnesia. The mage asks the Hero to help him find his identity, and the Hero \u2014 realizing that this is Azra Nightwielder \u2014 tells the mage of his true identity. If the Hero finds Azra before defeating Asuul for the second time, the quest will instead involve the Hero travelling to Lakvan's Stronghold in order to find the mage's identity. Once Azra is told of his true identity, the main quest continues as normal.\nAzra asks the Hero to meet him near Azra's Crossing, where he tells the Hero that there are in fact \"seven\" Star Teeth, not five. Azra then gives the Hero his own Star Tooth and the location of the final Star Teeth.\n&lt;a href=\"Glacier%20Crawl\"&gt;Glacier Crawl&lt;/a&gt;.\nInside the Glacier Crawl, the Hero finds an &lt;a href=\"Ice%20Tribe%20%28Shadowkey%29\"&gt;Ice Tribe&lt;/a&gt; hidden deep within, who had stolen the final Star Tooth from its original location. The Chieftain and every member of the ice tribe are massacred, and the final Star Tooth is eventually retrieved.\nFurther down the Glacier Crawl, the Hero finds &lt;a href=\"Captain%20Nym\"&gt;Captain Nym&lt;/a&gt;, who tells them of the origins of the Star Teeth; that they were taken from the sky with &lt;a href=\"airship\"&gt;airship&lt;/a&gt;s, and that the ice tribe had raided one such airship and murdered everyone inside. He may or may not have given the Hero the &lt;a href=\"Star%20Coif\"&gt;Star Coif&lt;/a&gt;, depending on if the Hero had all seven Star Teeth at that point.\nFinal Battle.\nOnce the Hero had obtained all seven Star Teeth, they could finally face and destroy the Umbra' Keth inside the &lt;a href=\"Crypt%20of%20Hearts\"&gt;Crypt of Hearts&lt;/a&gt;. Inside the crypt, the Hero finally defeats Asuul for the third and final time, and moves on to fight the Umbra' Keth, which claims that with the Soul of Conflict, it can become whole. The Hero leads the entity to the &lt;a href=\"Vault%20of%20the%20Heavens\"&gt;Vault of the Heavens&lt;/a&gt;, and places down the Star Teeth, making the \"Shadow of Conflict\" vulnerable.\nOnce the Hero defeats the Umbra' Keth, the threat is gone, and they take a teleporter created by Azra Nightwielder back to Azra's Crossing. They return to Azra, who states that they truly are the Hero that he hoped they would be. Though the Hero is victorious in their quest, the fate of the Soul of Conflict after this point is unknown.\nPhysical appearance.\nThough the final screen of the game depicts a robed silhouette holding what appears to be a longsword, there are sixteen different appearances that the Soul of Conflict can take, with two genders for each of the eight different &lt;a href=\"Races%20%28Shadowkey%29\"&gt;races&lt;/a&gt; available in \"Shadowkey\".\nPersonality and traits.\nThe Soul of Conflict is a silent protagonist, and is generally a character in which the player can reflect their own personality. However, the Soul of Conflict is presumed to be brave and upstanding due to their involvement in clearing the bandits from Azra's Crossing without hesitation. Throughout \"Shadowkey\", the Soul is claimed to have the soul of a hero, this further supports the idea of the character being courageous and especially selfless.\nThe responses that the Hero may give when talking to characters indicate a person who is always happy to help, but they may also have options to be more strict, not embarking on pointless quests when the character should be happy that they are alive. Most dialogue options also indicate a very optimistic attitude, as generally expected of and seen in a Hero of \"&lt;a href=\"The%20Elder%20Scrolls\"&gt;The Elder Scrolls&lt;/a&gt;\" series.\nPowers and abilities.\nMost of the Soul of Conflict's powers are dependent upon the &lt;a href=\"Classes%20%28Shadowkey%29\"&gt;class&lt;/a&gt; chosen by the Hero in the beginning of the game. With the different classes available, the Hero is capable of using a wide variety of &lt;a href=\"Spells%20%28Shadowkey%29\"&gt;spells&lt;/a&gt; and can wield numerous &lt;a href=\"Weapons%20%28Shadowkey%29\"&gt;weapons&lt;/a&gt;, ranging from daggers to magical longswords.\nThe Hero is shown to be able to use &lt;a href=\"Shadow%20Magic\"&gt;Shadow Magic&lt;/a&gt; to some degree, to the point where they are able to summon another version of themselves from another reality and wield weapons created using Shadow Magic, such as the &lt;a href=\"Shadow%20Stabber\"&gt;Shadow Stabber&lt;/a&gt;.\nAdditionally, the Soul of Conflict merges their shadow with &lt;a href=\"Azra%20Nightwielder\"&gt;Azra Nightwielder&lt;/a&gt;'s."}

This ended the Second Campaign, and ultimately led to the death of Regulus Sardecus.\n&lt;a href=\"Third%20Era\"&gt;Third Era&lt;/a&gt;.\nSoulrest during the Imperial Simulacrum.\nDuring the &lt;a href=\"Imperial%20Simulacrum\"&gt;Imperial Simulacrum&lt;/a&gt; from &lt;a href=\"3E%20389\"&gt;3E 389&lt;/a&gt; to &lt;a href=\"3E%20399\"&gt;3E 399&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Emperor\"&gt;Emperor&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Uriel%20Septim%20VII\"&gt;Uriel Septim VII&lt;/a&gt; was imprisoned along with &lt;a href=\"Talin%20Warhaft\"&gt;Talin Warhaft&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;a href=\"Deadlands\"&gt;Deadlands&lt;/a&gt; by &lt;a href=\"Jagar%20Tharn\"&gt;Jagar Tharn&lt;/a&gt;. Tharn planned for months to capture the throne, and he was able to achieve so in ten years. Tharn had a powerful weapon called the &lt;a href=\"Staff%20of%20Chaos\"&gt;Staff of Chaos&lt;/a&gt;, and he split it into nine pieces and scattered them across Tamriel, the staff was the only thing keeping Uriel Septim and Warhaft in &lt;a href=\"Oblivion\"&gt;Oblivion&lt;/a&gt;. A warrior escaped his clutches and traveled all corners of Tamriel to retrieve the missing pieces. The hero was known as the &lt;a href=\"Eternal%20Champion\"&gt;Eternal Champion&lt;/a&gt;, and he assembled the staff and defeated Jagar Tharn at the &lt;a href=\"Imperial%20Palace\"&gt;Imperial Palace&lt;/a&gt;. The Eternal Champion had at one point visited the city of Soulrest in their quest to recover the pieces. The city of Soulrest was under the rule of &lt;a href=\"Queen%20Heciana\"&gt;Queen Heciana&lt;/a&gt;."}

The souls of the sentient races are considered \"Black Souls\", and can only be soul trapped in Black Soul Gems. If a Soul Gem is not filled with a soul of its respective size, the caster's soul can leak into the Soul Gem while touching it. White Souls are considered safer for use than Black Souls. When a creature dies, its soul remains in the body for a time, preventing effective &lt;a href=\"necromancy\"&gt;necromancy&lt;/a&gt; until the soul has departed, and only the body remains. It is said that when one begins working on the art of necromancy, their soul gets corrupted. When a soul has departed, it is possible, through the use of magic, to make the soul control an object, such as what happened with the soul of &lt;a href=\"A%27Tor\"&gt;A'Tor&lt;/a&gt;, which powered the &lt;a href=\"Soul%20Sword\"&gt;Soul Sword&lt;/a&gt;. It is said that &lt;a href=\"Argonians\"&gt;Argonians&lt;/a&gt; get their soul from the &lt;a href=\"Hist\"&gt;Hist&lt;/a&gt; shortly after birth, and that upon death, their soul returns to the Hist.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Daedra\"&gt;Daedra&lt;/a&gt; do not have a \"soul\" in the direct manner. Rather, when a Daedra is slain, its vestige returns to its realm of Oblivion to be reformed into a new body, following which they live again. The Daedra are born in &lt;a href=\"Azure%20Plasm\"&gt;Azure Plasm&lt;/a&gt;, a lightblue liquid found in the realms of Oblivion. Conjured Dremora can free themselves from their master by soul trapping them.

The Soulburst resulted in the souls which originally meant to go to the &lt;a href=\"Soul%20Cairn\"&gt;Soul Cairn&lt;/a&gt; went to Coldharbour instead. Soul Shriven have strong feelings of emptiness, hunger, and desire. Soul Shriven also had great endurance, being capable of doing tasks for far longer, and sustain more injury, than a mortal could. When a Soul Shriven died, its body was entirely annihilated, which in turn, gave power to Molag Bal.\nDialogue.\n\"You must help me find my Arvak.

Every wizard that has attempted it vanishes without a trace. What can be known is that souls are a source of mystic energy that can be harvested.\nEvery creature, living or dead, is powered by a soul. Without it, they are just lumps of flesh or piles of bones. This animating force can be contained within a &lt;a href=\"Soul%20Gem\"&gt;soul gem&lt;/a&gt;, if the soul gem has the capacity. From the gem, the power can be used to power magical items.\nCenturies of experimentation has demonstrated that there are black souls and white souls. Only the rare &lt;a href=\"black%20soul%20gem\"&gt;black soul gem&lt;/a&gt; can hold the soul of a higher creature, such as a man or an elf. While the souls of lesser creatures can be captured by gems of many colors, they are all categorized as white soul gems. Hence the division of souls into black and white.\nWhite souls are far safer than black souls, although not as powerful. Beginning students of &lt;a href=\"Mysticism\"&gt;Mysticism&lt;/a&gt; should not dabble in black souls or black soul gems. Even if one were to ignore the guild strictures against the &lt;a href=\"Necromancy\"&gt;necromatic arts&lt;/a&gt; used to power black soul gems, it is dangerous to the caster to handle them for long. If the gem is not precisely the size of the encased soul, small bits of the caster's soul may leak into the gem when it is touched."}
{"id": "908789", "revid": "17401442", "url": "https://elderscrolls.fandom.com/wiki?curid=908789", "title": "Souls of the Betrayed", "text": "Souls of the Betrayed is a &lt;a href=\"Quests%20%28Online%29\"&gt;quest&lt;/a&gt; available in .\nBackground.\n\"A devout knight of the Divines discovered that the dead have awakened in the depths of Skyreach Catacombs. If the legend of Virmaril is true, then a powerful Elven necromancer could be the source of the trouble.\"\nWalkthrough.\nOutside the Skyreach Catacombs, you will meet a man named Crusader Dalamar. He will tell you that the dead here no longer rest, and that when he entered the catacombs to consecrate them, he heard a voice he suspects to be from the necromancer &lt;a href=\"Virmaril%20the%20Betrayer\"&gt;Virmaril the Betrayer&lt;/a&gt;, and he fled. He will ask you to make your way into the caverns and make the dead there dead again while he looks for another way in that avoids the voices. \nHead inside and start exploring. You will hear the voice of Virmaril taunting you. The path ahead to the lower floors is locked though; you will have to face bosses in the north and south of this floor. In the northernmost room, you will find the fallen kings. You will initially only be facing &lt;a href=\"The%20Sun%20King\"&gt;The Sun King&lt;/a&gt;, but &lt;a href=\"The%20Storm%20King\"&gt;The Storm King&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"The%20Flame%20King\"&gt;The Flame King&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"The%20Forest%20King\"&gt;The Forest King&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"The%20Blood%20King\"&gt;The Blood King&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"The%20Spirit%20King\"&gt;The Spirit King&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"The%20Shadow%20King\"&gt;The Shadow King&lt;/a&gt; will join in as the battle goes on. Each of these kings will summon two additional enemies to ais them in battle, so it is easy to get overwhelmed during this fight. A good strategy is to focus on one enemy at a time, rather than trying to take them all down at once. The Forest King is especially dangerous, as he uses ranged attacks and deals large amounts of damage. Once you have defeated the spirits of all the kings, &lt;a href=\"High%20King%20Durac\"&gt;High King Durac&lt;/a&gt; will attack you. He will raise the physical bodies of the other kings to assist him, but they will not summon any more allies during this second round so there is little chance they will overwhelm you. Take on the other kings first before you target Durac himself, so as to prevent getting swarmed. Once Durac is dead, one of the locks to the lower level is unlocked. \nWhen moving about this floor, make sure to avoid the eastern passageway, as it is home to a powerful boss called &lt;a href=\"The%20Cursed%20Orator\"&gt;The Cursed Orator&lt;/a&gt;. Either way, make your way to the southernmost room to face off against a boss called the &lt;a href=\"Gravelord\"&gt;Gravelord&lt;/a&gt;, Virmaril's prized creation. The Gravelord cannot hurt you if you keep your distance, so if you have projectiles, use them. He will summon skeletons that will power him up, but so long as you stay at a range, this does not matter. Killing the Gravelord will unlock the second lock to the lower level. \nOnce both the Gravelord and Durac are dead, proceed to the lower floor. There, head along the pathway and defeat the enemies along the way. Head through to the Cavern of the Lost Souls and fight your way through all the Nedic ghosts there. In the south of this room is a door to the Watery Grove; you'll be facing skeletons here again. The way to the Tomb of the Dead Watchers is pretty straightforward. In this tomb is your next boss battle, against &lt;a href=\"Watcher%20Armok\"&gt;Watcher Armok&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Watcher%20Garalan\"&gt;Watcher Garalan&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Watcher%20Shavmar\"&gt;Watcher Shavmar&lt;/a&gt;. These watchers once kept Vilmaril at bay, but now they serve him. These foes are quite formidable and they all use projectiles, so take care. Each time one of them is slain, two risen soldiers will appear and attack you. The best strategy here is to focus on one, kill the risen sodiers thereafter, and then target another one of the watchers. Once they are defeated, a chest of loot will spawn in the middle of the room. \nProceed onward to the Path of Dread. There will be some hordes of enemies here, but nothing you cannot handle at this point. At the end of this path, the way ahead is blocked by a Soul Ward put there by the ancient Nedes, but Virmaril is kind enough to provide the souls needed to break the ward. You will have to kill several waves of them though. Once you have defeated all the ghosts, you can head through the door ahead. Virmaril awaits down the path; make sure you are prepared for the fight. Virmaril will summon huge armies of ghosts to assist him during this fight; trying to kill them is pointless, as he summons them faster than you can kill them. Try to avoid getting swarmed by them and focus your attacks on Virmaril himself. Virmaril also has an attack that will trap you in place; this is a big problem as it allows the ghosts to gang up on you. Once the boss is dead, his ghosts will die with him. \nOnce the big boss has been destroyed, take the shortcut ahead back to the start of the lower catacombs, then head out of the dungeon. Once outside, talk to Crusader Dalamar to finish the quest."}

Although one point of a &lt;a href=\"Damage%20Skill\"&gt;Damage Skill&lt;/a&gt; effect is more potent than one point of Sound to lower a caster's chance of successfully casting spells, it only applies to only one school of magic and costs four times more Magicka. &lt;a href=\"Damage%20Attribute%20%28Morrowind%29\"&gt;Damaging&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Luck%20%28Morrowind%29\"&gt;Luck&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"Willpower%20%28Morrowind%29\"&gt;Willpower&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Attributes%20%28Morrowind%29\"&gt;attributes&lt;/a&gt; is far less effective for this purpose.

It is only when a victim is 50% fatigued that Sound's magnitude represents the actual reduction in the victim's percent chance of successfully casting a spell. A victim who is well rested experiences a greater loss (up to 1.25 \u00d7 Sound magnitude), while a victim who is nearing exhaustion experiences a lesser reduction (as low as 0.75 \u00d7 Sound magnitude).

His original (&lt;a href=\"Aldmeris\"&gt;Aldmeris&lt;/a&gt;? &lt;a href=\"Ehlnofex\"&gt;Ehlnofex&lt;/a&gt;?) name is PSJJJJ, which is and was meant to be unpronounceable. The Order was founded and organized to divine Padomay's eternal and ever-changing mystery. \"&lt;a href=\"Sithis\"&gt;Sithis&lt;/a&gt;\" is a corruption of \"Psijii\" which, in turn, was a derivation of the high concept PSJJJJ. Sithis was born when a nihilist sect of the already doom-ridden &lt;a href=\"Chimer\"&gt;Chimer&lt;/a&gt;i merged (under &lt;a href=\"Mephala\"&gt;Mephala&lt;/a&gt;'s tutelage) &lt;a href=\"Daedric\"&gt;Daedric&lt;/a&gt; elements with the Inexpressible Action that was Padomay. In essence they began to revere Padomay's Chaos nature (as opposed to that of Anu, who is Order), and over the years degenerated into a thuggish mystery-cult which wanted to \"murder the world.\" The Dark Brotherhood was born in these times-- which, in &lt;a href=\"Morrowind\"&gt;Morrowind&lt;/a&gt;, is known as the Morag Tong. Some of the higher-level Morag Tong maintain that they predate the Dark Brotherhood (more evidence of this later). That, in fact, they are an organization devoted to playing out the eternal interplay of Nir. Assassination, they say, is the purest celebration of joy or living. Whatever the case, the Padomay of Morrowind (and isolated Dark Brotherhood sects) is not the Padomay of &lt;a href=\"Artaeum\"&gt;Artaeum&lt;/a&gt;...\""}

Southern Elsweyr suffers from the ravages of the &lt;a href=\"Knahaten%20Flu\"&gt;Knahaten Flu&lt;/a&gt; and its subsequent purging flames, pirates, slavers, and now &lt;a href=\"Dragons%20%28Online%29\"&gt;dragons&lt;/a&gt;, which are supported by the &lt;a href=\"Order%20of%20the%20New%20Moon%20%28Faction%29\"&gt;Order of the New Moon&lt;/a&gt;.\nBackground.\nIn &lt;a href=\"2E%20577\"&gt;2E 577&lt;/a&gt;, following the &lt;a href=\"Colovian%20Revolt\"&gt;Colovian Revolt&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"Imperial%20Legion%23Divisions\"&gt;Thirteenth Legion&lt;/a&gt; was sent by Emperor &lt;a href=\"Varen%20Aquilarios%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Varen Aquilarios&lt;/a&gt; to help restore Southern Elsweyr from the effects of the &lt;a href=\"Knahaten%20Flu\"&gt;Knahaten Flu&lt;/a&gt; by defending the city as it rebuilt and helping to form a city council after the royal family had died. When the &lt;a href=\"Second%20Empire\"&gt;Empire&lt;/a&gt; effectively dissolved following the &lt;a href=\"Soulburst\"&gt;Soulburst&lt;/a&gt; and the beginning of the &lt;a href=\"Planemeld\"&gt;Planemeld&lt;/a&gt;, the Thirteenth Legion, popularly called the &lt;a href=\"Shields%20of%20Senchal\"&gt;Shields of Senchal&lt;/a&gt;, remained as protectors of the city and, by extension, the region.\nIn &lt;a href=\"2E%20582\"&gt;2E 582&lt;/a&gt;, following the reappearance of &lt;a href=\"Dragons%20%28Online%29\"&gt;dragons&lt;/a&gt; in Elsweyr, the Order of the New Moon was established under the leadership of the dragon &lt;a href=\"Laatvulon\"&gt;Laatvulon&lt;/a&gt; in service to &lt;a href=\"Kaalgrontiid%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Kaalgrontiid&lt;/a&gt; after he and his kin were released from the &lt;a href=\"Halls%20of%20Colossus%20%28Online%20Location%29\"&gt;Halls of Colossus&lt;/a&gt;. The Order of the New Moon recruits throughout Southern Elsweyr, promising initiates who worship the \"New Moon\" the opportunity to escape their poverty and destitution.\nLocations.\nThe following are locations accessible in Southern Elsweyr and, with the exception of &lt;a href=\"Unmarked%20Locations%20%28Online%29\"&gt;unmarked locations&lt;/a&gt;, are discoverable on the map. Points of Interest serve as locations with unique side quests, while &lt;a href=\"Cities%20%28Online%29\"&gt;cities&lt;/a&gt; serve as the centralised areas with multiple sublocations and act as a hub for services and &lt;a href=\"Merchants%20%28Online%29\"&gt;merchants&lt;/a&gt;. Explanations of the types of locations are provided in the &lt;a href=\"Locations%20%28Online%29%23Types\"&gt;main locations page&lt;/a&gt;.\nQuests.\nSouthern Elsweyr features a series of zone story quests and unrelated side quests. The zone story quests tie into the &lt;a href=\"Season%20of%20the%20Dragon\"&gt;Season of the Dragon&lt;/a&gt; overarching storyline and carries on from &lt;a href=\"Northern%20Elsweyr\"&gt;Northern Elsweyr&lt;/a&gt;, but it is not necessary to complete the story quests for zones prior to those in Southern Elsweyr. Side quests are non-sequential and can be completed in any order, except where one carries on from another, and &lt;a href=\"repeatable%20quests\"&gt;repeatable quests&lt;/a&gt; can be completed multiple times: weekly for arenas and trials and daily for all others. Note that the Epilogue for the Season of the Dragon requires the zone quests of both Northern and Southern Elsweyr to have been completed before it can be started.\nItem Sets.\nItem sets are related armor and weapons that, when worn together, provide unique benefits. Overland sets can be acquired from world bosses, world events, delves, public dungeons and containers and as quest rewards; dungeon sets can be acquired from within group dungeons; monster sets can be acquired from the final boss of veteran group dungeons and Undaunted Enclaves; and crafted sets can be created at specific locations across the zone.\nSkyshards.\nSix Skyshards can be found in Auridon totaling in two &lt;a href=\"skill%20points\"&gt;skill points&lt;/a&gt;. The zone guide provides clues as to the location of each Skyshard, but many can be found simply by exploring and watching for the distinctive pillar of light they emit. Skyshards will appear on the map and compass when the Vestige is close to one and will remain discovered on the map even if it was not collected.\nAchievements.\nAchievements can be earned by completing specific tasks such as completing quests and discovering locations. Achievements are separated into categories and their progress is viewable from the journal. Earning achievement provides the Vestige a number of points, and some achievements unlock unique rewards such as &lt;a href=\"Furnishings%20%28Online%29\"&gt;furnishings&lt;/a&gt; that can be bought from Achievement Furnishers or &lt;a href=\"collectibles\"&gt;collectibles&lt;/a&gt;.\nShalidor's Library.\nTen books that are a part of Shalidor's Library can be found in Southern Elsweyr and added to the collection. Books that have already been found in other zones will already be marked as completed in the zone tracker.\nFish.\nFish can be caught from fishing hotspots, ideally with the correct &lt;a href=\"bait\"&gt;bait&lt;/a&gt;. Common fish will be caught most often while rare fish and alternative bait are rare catches. Each zone has unique rare fish than can be caught from hotspots. &lt;a href=\"Slaughterfish%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Slaughterfish&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"trodh\"&gt;trodh&lt;/a&gt; can be caught from foul hotspots, &lt;a href=\"dhufish\"&gt;dhufish&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"longfin\"&gt;longfin&lt;/a&gt; can be caught from saltwater hotspots, &lt;a href=\"silverside%20perch\"&gt;silverside perch&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"spadetail\"&gt;spadetail&lt;/a&gt; can be caught from lake hotspots, and &lt;a href=\"Salmon%20%28Online%29\"&gt;salmon&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"River%20Betty%20%28Online%29\"&gt;river betty&lt;/a&gt; can be caught from river hotspots. &lt;a href=\"Chub\"&gt;Chub&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"minnow\"&gt;minnow&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"shad\"&gt;shad&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"fish%20roe\"&gt;fish roe&lt;/a&gt; can be caught and used as bait from foul, saltwater, lake and river hotspots, respectively. There are no lake sources in Southern Elsweyr."}

Southpoint had become the prime port town of the &lt;a href=\"Second%20Empire\"&gt;Second Empire&lt;/a&gt;, as well as, having a strong defense against the wilds of Valenwood.\nDescription.\nGeography.\nSouthpoint is built in the &lt;a href=\"Imperial\"&gt;Imperial&lt;/a&gt; style, with fortifications towards the east and the main gate. It is relatively small when compared to the other cities in Valenwood, but it is strategically along the south coast, between &lt;a href=\"Woodhearth\"&gt;Woodhearth&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Haven\"&gt;Haven&lt;/a&gt;. Southpoint is located in the &lt;a href=\"Long%20Coast\"&gt;Long Coast&lt;/a&gt; region of Grahtwood, which stretches along the Grahtwood south, and the cliffs of the mainland divide it. By the mainland, Southpoint has one connection that leads to Haven, which would eventually lead onto the rest of the province. Southpoint's main gate is to the east, and it leads straight into the town square. All around the center are homes and the local inn, as well as, a hill that contains the &lt;a href=\"Cathedral%20of%20the%20Golden%20Path\"&gt;Cathedral of the Golden Path&lt;/a&gt;, a place of worship in Southpoint. North from there is an island, with a small canal for boats, wooden ports, and several homes. Atop of the hill is the remains of a fort, with a tower overlooking the &lt;a href=\"Cape%20of%20the%20Blue%20Divide\"&gt;Cape of the Blue Divide&lt;/a&gt;.\nHistory.\n&lt;a href=\"First%20Era\"&gt;First Era&lt;/a&gt;.\nOn the 1st of &lt;a href=\"Rain%27s%20Hand\"&gt;Rain's Hand&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"1E%202729\"&gt;1E 2729&lt;/a&gt;, the city-state of Southpoint was founded by &lt;a href=\"Zantonius\"&gt;Zantonius&lt;/a&gt;. He was an &lt;a href=\"Imperial%20Legionnaire\"&gt;Imperial Legionnaire&lt;/a&gt; from &lt;a href=\"Kvatch\"&gt;Kvatch&lt;/a&gt; that was involved with the &lt;a href=\"Second%20Empire\"&gt;Second Empire&lt;/a&gt;'s control over Valenwood. Zantonius was a rash person that rose through the &lt;a href=\"Imperial%20Legion\"&gt;Imperial Legion&lt;/a&gt; ranks, and eventually taking a position at &lt;a href=\"Reman%27s%20Bluff\"&gt;Reman's Bluff&lt;/a&gt;. Around this time, the &lt;a href=\"Wood%20Orcs\"&gt;Wood Orcs&lt;/a&gt; of the &lt;a href=\"Barkbite%20Clan\"&gt;Barkbite Clan&lt;/a&gt; have been raiding their stronghold, who resisted the sudden rule of the Second Empire over their domain, the &lt;a href=\"Tarlain%20Heights\"&gt;Tarlain Heights&lt;/a&gt;. But on &lt;a href=\"Second%20Seed\"&gt;Second Seed&lt;/a&gt;, a Shaman of the Barkbite had approached the fort with a peace treaty that would end the constant battles between the factions, but Zantonius had hastily shot down the shaman, causing the conflict to continue. For his foolish actions, the Imperial Legate had sent him to a plot of land in the Long Coast, to build a camp there, so that he could not make things worse, but eventually, the Barkbite Clan had overrun Reman's Bluff, establishing their stronghold. Instead of building a fort, Zantonius declared this plot of land, Southpoint, which became a fortified settlement that quickly rose to prominence. Southpoint became a bustling port for the Second Empire, remaining as an Imperial township and integrating properly into Valenwood society.\n&lt;a href=\"Second%20Era\"&gt;Second Era&lt;/a&gt;.\nAfter the collapse of the Second Empire, Southpoint lost most of its significance, becoming nothing more than a sleepy coastal town with a big cathedral. During the &lt;a href=\"Interregnum\"&gt;Interregnum&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"2E%20582\"&gt;2E 582&lt;/a&gt;, the city-state of Southpoint was ruled by &lt;a href=\"Mayor%20Aulus\"&gt;Mayor Aulus&lt;/a&gt;, who ruled in conjunction with the &lt;a href=\"First%20Aldmeri%20Dominion\"&gt;First Aldmeri Dominion&lt;/a&gt;, situated out of nearby &lt;a href=\"Elden%20Root\"&gt;Elden Root&lt;/a&gt;. At around this time, &lt;a href=\"Queen%20Ayrenn\"&gt;Queen Ayrenn&lt;/a&gt; had arrived onto Elden Root, with the intent of entering &lt;a href=\"The%20Orrery%20%28Elden%20Root%29\"&gt;the Orrery&lt;/a&gt; to show her worthiness as their leader, but the Orrery requires a few components to operate. The Orrery Conservator, &lt;a href=\"Daraneth\"&gt;Daraneth&lt;/a&gt; had lived out of Southpoint for quite some time, and the Dominion had required her services. And so, &lt;a href=\"Prince%20Naemon\"&gt;Prince Naemon&lt;/a&gt; had sent an &lt;a href=\"Vestige\"&gt;Agent&lt;/a&gt; of the Dominion to find her and bring her back to Elden Root, but Southpoint would suffer a severe and maddening threat. Mayor Aulus was a secret worshipper of &lt;a href=\"Sheogorath\"&gt;Sheogorath&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"Daedric%20Prince\"&gt;Daedric Prince&lt;/a&gt; of Madness, who manipulated the Mayor's mind and turned Southpoint into a cesspool of chaos. Citizens had rioted in the streets, and thunder crashed the ruined fort. The Dominion was dispatched to quell the situation but were unable to enter the city. The Agent and Daraneth were able to venture throughout the town, stopping the rioters and &lt;a href=\"Rufinus\"&gt;Rufinus&lt;/a&gt;, a drunkard that unleashed lightning onto the area. Eventually, the two confronted Mayor Aulus and Sheogorath. In the end, Aulus was killed, and Sheogorath left Southpoint, as the Dominion recovered. Daraneth left Southpoint for Elden Root, to operate the Orrery.\n&lt;a href=\"Third%20Era\"&gt;Third Era&lt;/a&gt;.\nDuring the &lt;a href=\"Imperial%20Simulacrum\"&gt;Imperial Simulacrum&lt;/a&gt; from &lt;a href=\"3E%20389\"&gt;3E 389&lt;/a&gt; to &lt;a href=\"3E%20399\"&gt;3E 399&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Emperor\"&gt;Emperor&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Uriel%20Septim%20VII\"&gt;Uriel Septim VII&lt;/a&gt; was imprisoned along with &lt;a href=\"Talin%20Warhaft\"&gt;Talin Warhaft&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;a href=\"Deadlands\"&gt;Deadlands&lt;/a&gt; by &lt;a href=\"Jagar%20Tharn\"&gt;Jagar Tharn&lt;/a&gt;. Tharn planned for months to capture the throne, and he was able to achieve so in the span of ten years. Tharn had a powerful weapon called the &lt;a href=\"Staff%20of%20Chaos\"&gt;Staff of Chaos&lt;/a&gt;, and he split it into nine pieces and scattered them across Tamriel, the staff was the only thing keeping Uriel Septim and Warhaft in &lt;a href=\"Oblivion\"&gt;Oblivion&lt;/a&gt;. A warrior escaped his clutches and traveled all corners of Tamriel to retrieve the missing pieces. The hero was known as the &lt;a href=\"Eternal%20Champion\"&gt;Eternal Champion&lt;/a&gt;, and he assembled the staff and defeated Jagar Tharn at the &lt;a href=\"Imperial%20Palace\"&gt;Imperial Palace&lt;/a&gt;. The Eternal Champion had at one point visited the city of Southpoint in their quest to recover the pieces. The city of Southpoint was under the rule of &lt;a href=\"Queen%20Mindra\"&gt;Queen Mindra&lt;/a&gt;."}

It is something we all face. Or do we?\nJust ask the nearest &lt;a href=\"Nord\"&gt;Nord&lt;/a&gt; what he thinks of the end of life, and you'll likely be treated to a horrific story of blood, bone and viscera, of courageous deeds and heartbreaking sorrow. Carnage notwithstanding, there may be even more to death than the average Nord warrior realizes. New evidence suggests a life beyond the battlefield, where a valiant Nord may live forever, downing mead and engaging in contests of strength and skill. But in order to fully understand the possibility of a Nord's eternal life after death, one must first reexamine the legends surrounding that most wondrous of warrior's retreats -- Sovngarde.\nAccording to the ancient writings and oral traditions of the Nords, going back as far as the Late &lt;a href=\"Merethic%20Era\"&gt;Merethic Era&lt;/a&gt;, there exists a place so magnificent, so honored, that the entrance lies hidden from view. Sovngarde, it is called, built by the god &lt;a href=\"Shor\"&gt;Shor&lt;/a&gt; to honor those Nords who have proven their mettle in war. Within this \"Hall of Valor\" time as we know it has no meaning. The concepts of life and death are left on the doorstep, and those within exist in a sort of self-contained euphoria, free of pain, suffering and the worst malady a Nord could suffer -- boredom.\nBut just how well hidden the entrance to Sovngarde is has been a matter of much scholarly debate, and there are those who believe Shor's great hall is just a myth, for there are no actual accounts from Nords who have experienced the wonders of Sovngarde then returned to tell the tale. Not that this has stopped anyone from looking. Some Nords spend a lifetime searching for the mysterious hidden entrance to Sovngarde. Most return home sad and broken, their hearts heavy with failure. They'll never know the pleasure of a mead flagon that never empties, or a wrestling tournament without end.\nWhat, some may ask, does the entrance to Sovngarde have to do with death? Everything, according to a series of ancient parchments recently discovered in the attic of a deceased Nord's home in &lt;a href=\"Cyrodiil\"&gt;Cyrodiil&lt;/a&gt;. What at first seemed to be a series of love letters was later found to be a correspondence between one Felga Four-Fingers, a medium of some note, and the ghost of a Nord warrior named Rolf the Large. According to the parchments, Rolf had spent his entire life searching for the entrance to Sovngarde, without success. He was returning home to his village of &lt;a href=\"Skyrim\"&gt;Skyrim&lt;/a&gt; when he was waylaid by a band of giants. Rolf fought bravely, but was quickly killed, and the giants proceeded to play catch with his head. Amazingly, all of this was seen by Rolf in ghostly form as he drifted away from the scene, soaring upwards into the heavens, where he finally arrived\u2026in the magnificent hall of Sovngarde!\nRolf could not believe his good fortune, and his foolishness for not having realized the truth so many years before. For death was the entrance to Sovngarde. So he was told by Shor himself, who greeted Rolf the Large as a brother, and personally handed him a leg of roast mutton and the hand of a comely wench. Sovngarde, Shor told him, can be entered by any Nord who dies valiantly in honorable combat.\nIt is time for Nords to learn the truth. Eternal life can be theirs, without the need to spend an entire mortal life in vain pursuit of something completely unattainable. In the end, all valiant Nords can enter Sovngarde. Dismemberment, decapitation or evisceration seems a small price to pay for the chance to spend an eternity in Shor's wondrous hall."}

Many more paradise-seekers sought an entrance to Sovngarde other than the traditional mode\u2014death. One such explorer, Rolf the Large, failed to discover Sovngarde after a lifetime of searching. Defeated, he returned to &lt;a href=\"Skyrim\"&gt;Skyrim&lt;/a&gt;, where he was slain by &lt;a href=\"Giant%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;giants&lt;/a&gt;. After passing into Sovngarde, he wrote letters of correspondence with a psychic medium named Felga Four-Fingers, detailing the existence of this Nordic paradise of drinking and merriment. The letters were discovered in the medium's residence in &lt;a href=\"Cyrodiil\"&gt;Cyrodiil&lt;/a&gt;.\nInteractions.\nThe Dragonborn and Odahviing.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Last%20Dragonborn\"&gt;Dragonborn&lt;/a&gt; enters Sovngarde in the &lt;a href=\"Fourth%20Era\"&gt;Fourth Era&lt;/a&gt; after setting &lt;a href=\"Odahviing%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Odahviing&lt;/a&gt; free in the quest \"&lt;a href=\"The%20World-Eater%27s%20Eyrie\"&gt;The World-Eater's Eyrie&lt;/a&gt;.\" In return, Odahviing carries the Dragonborn to &lt;a href=\"Skuldafn%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Skuldafn&lt;/a&gt;, where a portal guarded by the &lt;a href=\"Dragon%20Priests%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Dragon Priest&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Nahkriin\"&gt;Nahkriin&lt;/a&gt; is found leading to Sovngarde.\nEntering Sovngarde.\nOnce inside Sovngarde, the Dragonborn discovers that &lt;a href=\"Alduin%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Alduin&lt;/a&gt; laid a mist where he hides and feeds upon trapped souls to gain strength. The Dragonborn needs to gain entrance to the &lt;a href=\"Hall%20of%20Valor\"&gt;Hall of Valor&lt;/a&gt; by defeating &lt;a href=\"Tsun\"&gt;Tsun&lt;/a&gt;, the Nordic god of trials against adversity, positioned there to test those who wish to enter the hall by challenging them to a battle.\nOnce the Dragonborn gains entrance into the hall, they meet with the three heroes who the Dragonborn saw in a vision of the past that showed the last defeat of Alduin during the &lt;a href=\"Dragon%20War\"&gt;Dragon War&lt;/a&gt;. The heroes, &lt;a href=\"Gormlaith%20Golden-Hilt\"&gt;Gormlaith Golden-Hilt&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Hakon%20One-Eye\"&gt;Hakon One-Eye&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Felldir%20the%20Old\"&gt;Felldir the Old&lt;/a&gt; are then permitted by &lt;a href=\"Shor\"&gt;Shor&lt;/a&gt;, the chief deity of the Nordic pantheon, to join the Dragonborn in the &lt;a href=\"Dragonslayer\"&gt;battle against Alduin&lt;/a&gt;.\nAlduin's fate.\nThe Last Dragonborn finally kills Alduin in Sovngarde alongside the three other heroes of Sovngarde, Hakon One-Eye, Felldir the Old, and Gormlaith Golden-Hilt. Thus, Alduin is banished from the world forever, although &lt;a href=\"Arngeir\"&gt;Arngeir&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Paarthurnax%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Paarthurnax&lt;/a&gt; theorize he may return in the future to fulfill his destiny as the World-Eater.\nWerewolf spirit.\nKodlak, the Harbinger of the Companions, dies as a werewolf and does not go to Sovngarde. The Dragonborn is able to mend this by killing the Wolf spirit within him after breaking the &lt;a href=\"Spells%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;spell&lt;/a&gt; that made him a werewolf."}

Now to find Alduin and defeat him once and for all.\"\nWalkthrough.\nWhen entering &lt;a href=\"Sovngarde%20%28Location%29\"&gt;Sovngarde&lt;/a&gt;, walk down the stairs, and there will be a &lt;a href=\"Stormcloak%20Soldier\"&gt;Stormcloak Soldier&lt;/a&gt;. He will say that he cannot reach the &lt;a href=\"Hall%20of%20Valor\"&gt;Hall of Valor&lt;/a&gt; due to the deadly mist. In this mist, &lt;a href=\"Alduin%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Alduin&lt;/a&gt; hunts for lost souls to gain power. After the conversation, follow the path through the mist. If one chooses to help the Stormcloak, he will be devoured. Note: One can clear the mist using the &lt;a href=\"Clear%20Skies\"&gt;Clear Skies&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"shout\"&gt;shout&lt;/a&gt;.\nNote: the soldier does not always start in the beginning, and there is a good chance the soldier will not be encountered until part way through the mist. Do not worry, the mist will not engulf the Dragonborn, as they speak with the soldier.\nIf the player has killed &lt;a href=\"Ulfric%20Stormcloak%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Ulfric&lt;/a&gt;, his soul will be here, saying, \"We can't get anything done in this fog\" and will tell them to turn back. Also, &lt;a href=\"Galmar%20Stone-Fist\"&gt;Galmar Stone-Fist&lt;/a&gt; can be found saying, \"\"&lt;a href=\"Last%20Dragonborn\"&gt;Dragonborn&lt;/a&gt;, even in death you dog my steps?\" and \"How come you're here? The king of this realm will cast you out - cursed be your name by all sons of &lt;a href=\"Skyrim\"&gt;Skyrim&lt;/a&gt;, with scorn unceasing.\"\"\nConversely, if they followed the Stormcloak quest, &lt;a href=\"Legate%20Rikke%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Rikke&lt;/a&gt; will be here if they killed her.\nAlso, if they have finished &lt;a href=\"the%20Companions\"&gt;the Companions&lt;/a&gt; quests, &lt;a href=\"Kodlak%20Whitemane\"&gt;Kodlak Whitemane&lt;/a&gt; will be wandering in the fog.\nIf they have completed the &lt;a href=\"Bards%20College%20%28Skyrim%20Faction%29\"&gt;Bards College&lt;/a&gt; quest \"&lt;a href=\"Tending%20the%20Flames\"&gt;Tending the Flames&lt;/a&gt;,\" they can see &lt;a href=\"Svaknir\"&gt;Svaknir&lt;/a&gt;, who wrote the verse they retrieved, along their path.\nWhalebone Bridge.\nAt the end of the path, the &lt;a href=\"Hall%20of%20Valor\"&gt;Hall of Valor&lt;/a&gt; comes into full view. The majestic building is situated at the far side of a great chasm that can only be reached by crossing the Whalebone Bridge.\nIn front of the bridge stands &lt;a href=\"Tsun\"&gt;Tsun&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"Nord\"&gt;Nord&lt;/a&gt;ic god of trials against adversity who will begin dialogue when approached. The first two questions give some background about Tsun and his relationship with Shor. He also gives some insight into the current situation in Sovngarde. In the last question, Tsun asks why he should allow the Dragonborn entry into the Hall of Valor. The right of birth will always be available, however the other options will only appear if the respective guild questlines have been completed.\n\"What brings you, wayfarer grim, to wander here, in Sovngarde, souls-end, Shor's gift to honored dead?\"\nThis prompts a battle with Tsun as he draws his Ancient Nord Battle Axe and can use &lt;a href=\"Unrelenting%20Force%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Unrelenting Force&lt;/a&gt;. When his health reaches about 60%, he will yield and allow the Dragonborn to cross the bridge to the Hall of Valor. If they try to skip the test, they will die when they walk on the bridge - even if they have god mode on with console commands.\nHall of Valor.\nUpon entering the Hall of Valor, &lt;a href=\"Ysgramor%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Ysgramor&lt;/a&gt; himself will greet the Dragonborn:\nYsgramor: \"Welcome, Dragonborn! Our door has stood empty since Alduin first set his soul-snare here. By Shor's command we sheathed our blades and ventured not the vale's dark mist. But three await your word to loose their fury upon the perilous foe. Gormlaith the Fearless, glad-hearted in battle; Hakon the Valiant, heavy-handed warrior; Felldir the Old, far-seeing and grim.\"\nHe will instruct the Dragonborn to speak to &lt;a href=\"Gormlaith%20Golden-Hilt\"&gt;Gormlaith Golden-Hilt&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Hakon%20One-Eye\"&gt;Hakon One-Eye&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Felldir%20the%20Old\"&gt;Felldir the Old&lt;/a&gt; - the three heroes who defeated Alduin in the past. Approaching them will initiate the following dialogue:\nGormlaith: \"At long last! Alduin's doom is now ours to seal - just speak the word and with high hearts we'll hasten forth to smite the worm wherever he lurks.\"\nFelldir: \"Hold, comrades - let us counsel take before battle is blindly joined. Alduin's mist is more than a snare - its shadowy gloom is his shield and cloak. But with four voices joined, our valor combined, we can blast the mist and bring him to battle.\"\nHakon: \"Felldir speaks wisdom - the World-Eater, coward, fear you, Dragonborn. We must drive away his mist, Shouting together, and then unsheathe our blades in desperate battle with our black-winged foe.\"\nGormlaith: \"To battle, my friends! The fields will echo with the clamor of war, our wills undaunted.\"\nOnce their speech is completed, they will ready their weapons and charge outside to face Alduin. This completes the quest and begins &lt;a href=\"Dragonslayer\"&gt;Dragonslayer&lt;/a&gt;. "}

A contribution by to the World Creator expansion for Skyrim. The Space Core plummets from space, and crash lands near a watchtower, where it will talk only about space, as it does in \"Portal 2\". It can be picked up as a &lt;a href=\"Miscellaneous%20Items%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;miscellaneous item&lt;/a&gt;. The mod was created by both Valve and &lt;a href=\"Bethesda%20Softworks\"&gt;Bethesda Softworks&lt;/a&gt;.\nLocation.\nOnce downloaded from the Steam Workshop, it can be found near &lt;a href=\"Whiterun%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Whiterun's&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Western%20Watchtower\"&gt;Western Watchtower&lt;/a&gt;. You can &lt;a href=\"Fast%20Travel%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;fast travel&lt;/a&gt; there, and see an object fall from the sky. If you walk to where it lands (inside a destroyed building), you will find that it landed near the old fireplace of the hut with a large plume of smoke coming out of it. Discovering it will immediately trigger it to mutter things about space.\nUse.\nBesides humor, and it being an irregular item in , it can be modified into a &lt;a href=\"Skyrim\"&gt;Skyrim&lt;/a&gt;-style &lt;a href=\"helmet\"&gt;helmet&lt;/a&gt;. A &lt;a href=\"dovahcore%20helmet\"&gt;dovahcore helmet&lt;/a&gt; can be made by using the &lt;a href=\"atronach%20forge\"&gt;atronach forge&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;a href=\"Midden\"&gt;Midden&lt;/a&gt; under the &lt;a href=\"College%20of%20Winterhold%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;College of Winterhold&lt;/a&gt;. To do this, place the Space Core on the pedestal (where one would place the &lt;a href=\"Sigil%20Stone%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;sigil stone&lt;/a&gt;) and put two &lt;a href=\"Moonstone%20Ore%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;moonstone ores&lt;/a&gt; or one &lt;a href=\"refined%20moonstone\"&gt;refined moonstone&lt;/a&gt; and an &lt;a href=\"Iron%20Helmet%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;iron helmet&lt;/a&gt; in the offering chest.\nActivate the pullbar, then watch the helmet appear on the &lt;a href=\"forge\"&gt;forge&lt;/a&gt;. The helmet is similar in appearance to the actual Core, yet, there is no eye and it is smaller.\nBack into space.\nShould one want the Core to travel back into space as it has obviously been wanting, they can easily do it with a large amount of &lt;a href=\"magicka%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;magicka&lt;/a&gt; and a &lt;a href=\"Spells%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;spell&lt;/a&gt;.\nEquip the &lt;a href=\"Lightning%20Bolt%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Lightning Bolt&lt;/a&gt; spell in each hand to dual cast. Hold the Core, raise your hands, ready the spell, aim into the sky, and fire. The Core will fly into the air, at about the same speed he was going when you first saw him. He will disappear into the sky, back to space.\nThe Giant's club glitch can also be used to launch the Space Core back to space. Just place him in front of the Giant when it raises its club and as soon as they connect, the Core will be shot back up with a joyful \"YEEEHA!\". Be careful as you do it, you don't want to join him as well.\nScrapped quest.\nIf one opens the console and types the &lt;a href=\"Console%20Commands%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;command&lt;/a&gt; codice_1 they will see the quest name codice_2, hinting there may have been an upcoming quest regarding the Core and referring to \"Portal 2\" that was later scrapped during development."}

This body will be holding &lt;a href=\"Gamirth%27s%20Final%20Message\"&gt;a note&lt;/a&gt;; read it, and you'll discover that there is some kind of spell at work in the Everfull Flagon that makes the mead near irresistible. Head inside and talk to &lt;a href=\"Bernt%20the%20Brittle\"&gt;Bernt the Brittle&lt;/a&gt;. He will tell you that you should not drink the mead here, and that you should not attract the suspicion of &lt;a href=\"Thane%20Fellrig\"&gt;Thane Fellrig&lt;/a&gt;. He'll also tell you that Gamirth was his daughter &lt;a href=\"Nelhilda\"&gt;Nelhilda&lt;/a&gt;'s boyfriend. Gamirth and Nelhilda were working on a plan to end this place's curse; you should head upstairs and talk to Nelhilda. \nNelhilda will be upstairs in the back room. She says she can make a potion that can undo the addicting effects of the mead, but she requires a special kind of flower called &lt;a href=\"Kyne%27s%20Tear\"&gt;Kyne's Tear&lt;/a&gt;. These flowers are invisible to anyone who doesn't carry a runestone of &lt;a href=\"Kyne\"&gt;Kyne&lt;/a&gt;, so she suggests you look for one at the abandoned shrine to Kyne nearby. Said shrine is to the southeast; head there and pick up the runestone, then search the area for the flowers. They tend to grow near the roots of the dead trees. Once you have four of them, return to the Flagon and give them to Nelhilda, who will then use them to craft a potion.\nTake the potion and pour it into the casks of mead downstairs, Then talk to Bernt the Brittle. He will reveal that he was once the bartender here; he made a bad deal with a mage who turned out to be a daedric prince, which caused all this mess. He will then tell you something about what some of these people were like before they succumbed to the addictive mead; &lt;a href=\"Hautt%20Silvertongue\"&gt;Hautt Silvertongue&lt;/a&gt; was a respected Bard and &lt;a href=\"Hridi%20Daggerhand\"&gt;Hridi Daggerhand&lt;/a&gt; was a skilled duelist. Bernt thinks that now that the mead's curse is wearing off, these people can be convinced to act as leaders and break everyone free. He wants you to bring Hautt bach his lute and Hridi her daggers. \nIf you speak to Hautt about where he last had his lute, he will challenge you to a duel of words to get him to reveal the information, but you can intimidate him to get it right away. If you don't intimidate him, . If you do, he'll tell you that he last played his lute by the statue outside &lt;a href=\"Juvilda\"&gt;Juvilda&lt;/a&gt;'s house. If you talk to Hridi, she'll reveal that she hid her daggers by the old mill. Head out of the flagon and collect these items; Juvilda's house is just north of the Flagon; the lute will be in an urn there. The house north of the one with the lute also contains something of note: the lorebook &lt;a href=\"The%20Black%20Forge\"&gt;The Black Forge&lt;/a&gt;, so be sure to pick that up. The mill Hridi talked about is east of here, northeast of the flagon. The chest containing the daggers will be inside, to your right. Once you have the items, head back to the Flagon.\nWhen you get back to the flagon, you'll witness a scene where a group of patrons confront the Thane and tell him they don't want his mead any more. the Thane reveals himself to be a disguised dremora , then he disappears. Talk to Bernt about what happened; he'll be upstairs. Bernt says he will give the lute and the daggers back to their owners, and will reveal that the Thane currently has the souls of the people here. He will ask you to deal with the Thane and return everyone's souls; he suspects that the Thane's den is in one of the nice houses near the well. \nHead outside and to the west. The Thane's lair will be in the basement of the big house you see down the cliff. Head in and through the hallway and you'll find the Thane ready for battle. Kill him, then destroy the Soul Keeper up on the pedestal to set everyone's souls free. Once this is done, return to the Flagon and speak with Bernt. Convince him to tell everyone the truth. Nelhilda will be very angry with him after this; speak with her and you can either convince her to forgive him or tell her that he needs to be punished. If you opt for punishment, . If you opt for forgiveness, she will lead the residents of the Flagon to the &lt;a href=\"Hollow%20City\"&gt;Hollow City&lt;/a&gt;. This will finish the quest."}

Its name comes from the fire red fronds that protect its golden flower. As pretty as it is, it is a deadly poison to most living beings and needs to be avoided by adventurers. It is said, however, that &lt;a href=\"Argonians\"&gt;Argonians&lt;/a&gt; can pick the plant and use the sap derived from its roots as an enhancement to their endurance.\n&lt;a href=\"Domica%20Redwort\"&gt;Domica Redwort&lt;/a&gt; is a herb grown by many residents of &lt;a href=\"Valenwood\"&gt;Valenwood&lt;/a&gt; for their beautiful and showy flowers.

Lucien can also offer advice on current quests.\nIt is possible to kill Lucien without him fighting back, but this will likely require a one-hit kill because Lucien will fight back after several strikes. This may be useful if the Dragonborn is trying to listen to other NPCs, as he often overpowers them with his bass-heavy voice. Note that killing the specter will be viewed as a crime against the Brotherhood if the attack is witnessed. If witnessed killing Lucien, the Dragonborn will be confronted upon return to the sanctuary, and will not be allowed to continue any Brotherhood quests until a fine of 500 is paid.\nEven after the fine is paid, the other members of the Brotherhood will continue to comment on how the family was disrespected. Also note that simply attacking Lucien a few times will not result in a penalty; Lucien must be attacked to the point that he fights back. The best approach seems to be a stealth backstab so that a penalty will not be received."}

The &lt;a href=\"Night%20Mother\"&gt;Night Mother&lt;/a&gt; recognized Lucien as being loyal to the Brotherhood, keeping his soul in the &lt;a href=\"Void\"&gt;Void&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"Sithis\"&gt;Sithis&lt;/a&gt;, and had his spirit summonable by the Brotherhood as a reward.\nPersonality.\nThe Spectral Assassin often comments on his days working for the Brotherhood, on the Dragonborn's decisions during the Dark Brotherhood questline, and on the fact he and they are connected through the Void. He often makes his fervour and dedication to the Brotherhood clear with his remarks.\nCombat.\nThe Spectral Assassin carries a &lt;a href=\"Steel%20Dagger%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;steel dagger&lt;/a&gt; in battle and wears &lt;a href=\"Shrouded%20Robes\"&gt;Shrouded Robes&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Shrouded%20Hand%20Wraps\"&gt;Shrouded Hand Wraps&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Shrouded%20Shoes\"&gt;Shrouded Shoes&lt;/a&gt;, and a &lt;a href=\"Shrouded%20Hood\"&gt;Shrouded Hood&lt;/a&gt;, benefiting from their use.

This skill is a combination of both &lt;a href=\"Speechcraft\"&gt;Speechcraft&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Mercantile\"&gt;Mercantile&lt;/a&gt; skills of previous \"&lt;a href=\"The%20Elder%20Scrolls\"&gt;Elder Scrolls&lt;/a&gt;\" games and replaces them. Speech may also help with quests by unlocking special dialogue interactions, including Intimidate, Persuade, Bribe, Mock, &lt;a href=\"Brawl\"&gt;Brawl&lt;/a&gt;, and more.\nGoverning &lt;a href=\"Guardian%20Stones\"&gt;Guardian Stones&lt;/a&gt;: &lt;a href=\"The%20Thief%20Stone%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;The Thief Stone&lt;/a&gt;\nUsefulness and function.\nSpeech directly affects the prices paid when buying from and selling to &lt;a href=\"Merchants%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;merchants&lt;/a&gt;, even without the assorted &lt;a href=\"Perks%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;perks&lt;/a&gt;. At 0 Speech, &lt;a href=\"Merchants%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;merchants&lt;/a&gt; sell items for 3 times their base price, and buy for a third of their base price. At 100 Speech, merchants will sell items for twice their base price and buy them for half as much. Alternatively, Speech can be used to persuade people into doing things or divulging crucial information. Bribes made are also governed by Speech. There are 65 male and 45 female &lt;a href=\"Merchants%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;merchants&lt;/a&gt; in Skyrim, so Dragonborns interested in Allure have an advantage if they choose to be female.\nPerks.\nThe following are the &lt;a href=\"Perks%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;perks&lt;/a&gt; that become available to select as the skill is leveled up:\n&lt;onlyinclude&gt;\n&lt;/onlyinclude&gt;\nPrices.\nPrices are computed by the following:\nSkills over 100 have no effect.\nLeveling.\nThe speech skill increase depends on the base value of the item traded or the difficulty of the bribe or persuasion. When selling items, it is not actually required to receive any gold, only that the transaction takes place. The skill increase only occurs once per transaction. In order to optimize leveling, expensive items in groups of 6 or more should be sold individually, rather than all at once.\nBooks.\nThe following books provide a permanent one-time increase to the Dragonborn's Speech skill. See each book's page for a list of possible locations.\nQuests.\nThe following quests increase or help to increase the Speech skill:\nLeveling tips.\nBribing guards.\nMembers of the &lt;a href=\"Thieves%20Guild%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Thieves Guild&lt;/a&gt; have the option to bribe guards when minor &lt;a href=\"Bounty%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;crimes&lt;/a&gt; are committed. Repeatedly committing small crimes, such as trespassing or pickpocketing, and bribing guards to look the other way can help level Speech quickly. spent bribing a guard can be pickpocketed back easily with a high enough pickpocket skill.\nPersuading guards.\nSimilar to the above method, after progressing far enough into the &lt;a href=\"Thieves%20Guild%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Thieves Guild&lt;/a&gt; questline, the Dragonborn can commit a minor crime, such as failed pickpocketing or stealing. Once the crime has been committed, the Dragonborn can go up to a guard and initiate the \"Wait, I know you.\" dialogue. Any option (aside from resisting or submitting to arrest) should be available to persuade them to overlook it. Though the guards says they will not let it slide the next time, they will never attack or arrest the Dragonborn (unless the submit or resist dialogue option was chosen).\nNote: This will not remove the bounty, it will just stop the conversation peacefully, while slightly improving Speech. This can then be done to all of the guards in a &lt;a href=\"Hold\"&gt;Hold&lt;/a&gt;, but it should not be repeated on the same guard, as this can cause the option to go away. Instead, all the guards should be cycled through with the dialogue. This is especially useful at medium-high levels, since nothing has to be paid or sold, and the risk is practically zero.\nLearning bonuses.\nWearing the &lt;a href=\"Aetherial%20Crown\"&gt;Aetherial Crown&lt;/a&gt;, obtain the blessings from the &lt;a href=\"The%20Lover%20Stone%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Lover Stone&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"The%20Thief%20Stone%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Thief Stone&lt;/a&gt;, and combine with &lt;a href=\"Abilities%20%28Skyrim%29%23Quest_abilities\"&gt;Gift of the Gab&lt;/a&gt; and any &lt;a href=\"Rest%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;rested&lt;/a&gt; bonuses (remove crown/lover stone before resting) will make leveling up Speech even faster (65% with the rested lover's comfort bonus, 60% with well rested). Note that only the Lover and Thief Stones, and Gift of the Gab may be used if the Dragonborn is infected with &lt;a href=\"Werewolf%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;lycanthropy&lt;/a&gt;, as werewolves do not benefit from resting bonuses.\nRepeatedly buying and selling.\nTo increase the efficiency of this method get all the learning bonuses above, sell items in groups of 6 or more individually, get a necklace with the &lt;a href=\"Fortify%20Barter\"&gt;Fortify Barter&lt;/a&gt; enchantment or an &lt;a href=\"Amulet%20of%20Zenithar\"&gt;Amulet of Zenithar&lt;/a&gt;, activate the &lt;a href=\"Shrine%20of%20Zenithar\"&gt;Shrine of Zenithar&lt;/a&gt;, get &lt;a href=\"The%20Gift%20of%20Charity\"&gt;The Gift of Charity&lt;/a&gt; and take a &lt;a href=\"Potions%20%28Skyrim%29%23Fortify%20Barter\"&gt;Haggling potion&lt;/a&gt;.\nGet a large amount of high value items, in total the value should be tens of thousands of Septims or more. Stolen items are fine. If you have a large pile of otherwise useless items as the result of levelling &lt;a href=\"Alchemy%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Alchemy&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Enchanting%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Enchanting&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Pickpocket\"&gt;Pickpocket&lt;/a&gt;ing or &lt;a href=\"Smithing%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Smithing&lt;/a&gt; that is perfect. Keep in mind that you will sacrifice these items to level Speech. Find a merchant who accepts your items. If your items are stolen this should be a fence and if you get better prices from the opposite sex make sure your merchant is. Now sell them items until the merchant runs out of gold. Now buy one or two items back. You will probably pay several times more than they gave you for it, but the seller has gold again. Sell the merchant some more items until they run out of gold again. Repeat this until you run out of items. This allows you to work around the otherwise limited gold merchants have because you are effectively giving it to them.\nPersuade the toll road bandit.\nA &lt;a href=\"Bandits%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;bandit&lt;/a&gt; at &lt;a href=\"Valtheim%20Towers\"&gt;Valtheim Towers&lt;/a&gt; will tell the Dragonborn that the road they are on is a toll road, and will demand for 200. An option to persuade and pay only 50 is available. It can be repeated every time when using the road, and will always increase the Dragonborn's Speech skill if the persuasion is used successfully.\nPersuade and intimidate Calcelmo.\nThose who deliver a &lt;a href=\"Dwemer\"&gt;Dwemer&lt;/a&gt; item to &lt;a href=\"Calcelmo\"&gt;Calcelmo&lt;/a&gt; may both persuade/intimidate for a better deal and exit the conversation before selecting either, \"Sold. Here you go. (Gain ___ gold),\" or, \"Not good enough. I'll hold onto this. You'll need to find another one.\" Intimidation requires 40 Speech to be successful; persuading requires 50. Each option can be performed once per item brought to him.\nLeveling tips (glitches).\nAhkari's merchant inventory.\nIn &lt;a href=\"Dawnstar%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Dawnstar&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Ahkari\"&gt;Ahkari's&lt;/a&gt; merchant inventory can be accessed through a glitch (see page for details). After placing all gold in the chest, all the items in inventory can be sold to the merchant. Doing this will give back the gold put into the chest. Afterward, the items can be retrieved from the chest and the process repeated forever. The net is no change to gold or items, but an increase in Speech skill.\nIntimidate Anton Virane.\nDuring the &lt;a href=\"Dark%20Brotherhood%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Dark Brotherhood&lt;/a&gt; quest \"&lt;a href=\"Recipe%20for%20Disaster\"&gt;Recipe for Disaster&lt;/a&gt;,\" &lt;a href=\"Anton%20Virane\"&gt;Anton Virane&lt;/a&gt; can be intimidated repeatedly to level Speech. This can be accomplished by:\nThis can be repeated forever.\nIntimidating Sabjorn.\nDuring the \"&lt;a href=\"Dampened%20Spirits\"&gt;Dampened Spirits&lt;/a&gt;\" quest, the &lt;a href=\"Last%20Dragonborn\"&gt;Dragonborn&lt;/a&gt; can loop a conversation with &lt;a href=\"Sabjorn\"&gt;Sabjorn&lt;/a&gt; to quickly level Speech. To do this:\nIntimidate Nelacar.\nDuring the Daedric quest \"The Black Star,\" the Dragonborn can continually intimidate Nelacar in the Inn in Winterhold. When he asks \"Who sent you?\" choose the Intimidate option and immediately exit the conversation. This can be repeated indefinitely.\nPersuade Ungrien.\nAt anytime the Dragonborn can enter the &lt;a href=\"Black-Briar%20Meadery\"&gt;Black-Briar Meadery&lt;/a&gt; where you will encounter the shop attendant &lt;a href=\"Ungrien\"&gt;Ungrien&lt;/a&gt;. Confront him and then repeatably persuade him to tell the truth about how he feels about his employer Maven Black-Briar. This glitch can be repeated indefinitely.\nNote:\nPersuade Ulfric Stormcloak.\nDuring the quest \"&lt;a href=\"Season%20Unending\"&gt;Season Unending&lt;/a&gt;\", &lt;a href=\"Ulfric%20Stormcloak%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Ulfric Stormcloak&lt;/a&gt; can be persuaded to attend the peace council. If immediately left in dialogue following the persuasion attempt, the option can be used again.\nItems.\nSome items increase the Speech skill or bartering. These include:\nIn addition, two blessings can be granted:"}

When trying to persuade a character, bribery costs half of what it would normally.\"\nCharacter dialogue.\nWhen your Speechcraft skill is 70 or higher, characters will say: \"You've got quite the silver tongue.\"\nOne purpose.\nWith effective leveling, you build a character to maximize all of the attributes to 100 by gaining +5 / +5 / +5 (+1 for Luck).\nIn order to do this, you must study the game mechanics and master the leveling process. It takes 10 of any Major Skills to gain one level. In this process, should all 10 happen to fall under one attribute, such as &lt;a href=\"Strength%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;Strength&lt;/a&gt;, then when you rest you will be granted +5 towards that attribute, in this case Strength. But doing so results in the question; If I used all 10 on Strength-related skills, where does the rest come from?\nThat answer, is effective leveling. Let's assume you also want to raise &lt;a href=\"Endurance%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;Endurance&lt;/a&gt; as well as Personality. Instead of doing at least three Major Skills and hoping for the best with +2's and +3's, you raise your Minor Skills first. If you gain all 10 Major Skills first, then anything else is shoved aside and is considered wasted. The Minor Skills really don't roll over to the next level, yet they don't tend to carry with the current. Therefore, you raise your Minor skills first. Suppose you have no Personality-related Major Skills, yet you want your Personality raised for the next level. Your options are Speechcraft, &lt;a href=\"Mercantile%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;Mercantile&lt;/a&gt;, and Illusion. Let's assume you don't have the money or the items to use Mercantile, and you don't have enough &lt;a href=\"Magicka%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;Magicka&lt;/a&gt; or the proper spells to raise Illusion. Then you have one option left, Speechcraft training. Enter the chat-menu and keep playing the game, purposely keeping his/her deposition low. You can blow through ten levels in Speechcraft in just a few minutes. This then grants you the +5 bonus to the Personality for the next level. Next, do your (for our example) Endurance, then Strength and rest. And just like that, +5 Strength, +5 Endurance, and +5 Personality for your next level."}

It also works against &lt;a href=\"Diseases%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;diseases&lt;/a&gt; that the &lt;a href=\"Last%20Dragonborn\"&gt;Dragonborn&lt;/a&gt; can contract, as well as venomous attacks and other poisons, without conferring any Magicka.\nSome in-game descriptions (e.g. on the &lt;a href=\"The%20Atronach%20Stone%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;The Atronach Stone&lt;/a&gt;, and items dropped by &lt;a href=\"Miraak\"&gt;Miraak&lt;/a&gt;) of Spell Absorption are incorrect, and suggest that it always absorbs X% of a hostile effect; in reality, it is an X% chance to absorb 100% of the effect. If it does not trigger, it does nothing.\nUnlike other magical resistances that cap at 85%, Spell Absorption has no cap and can surpass 100%.\nAcquisition.\nSpell absorption can only be obtained from seven sources; however, they can be stacked.\nAchieving 100% absorption.\n100% spell absorption can make a character immune to almost all types of magical attacks. Complete immunity can be achieved in a number of ways:\nTemporary.\nA temporary 100% spell absorption can be achieved for a &lt;a href=\"Bretons%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Breton&lt;/a&gt; simply by choosing the &lt;a href=\"The%20Atronach%20Stone%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Atronach Stone&lt;/a&gt; (50%) and activating their racial power, &lt;a href=\"Dragonskin%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Dragonskin&lt;/a&gt; (50%), but only for 60 seconds.\nWard Absorb can also push the 80% permanent spell absorption to 105%, but only while the ward is active, and only in the direction the ward is facing. This can be done with the low-magicka-cost Lesser Ward, or &lt;a href=\"Spellbreaker%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Spellbreaker&lt;/a&gt; for cheap, total spell absorption.\nPermanent.\nA permanent 80% spell absorption can be achieved by any race of character by using the &lt;a href=\"The%20Atronach%20Stone%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Atronach Stone&lt;/a&gt; (50%) and choosing the Atronach &lt;a href=\"Alteration%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Alteration&lt;/a&gt; perk (30%). This can be pushed to 100% absorption in five ways:\nUsing any of the above techniques in conjunction with the &lt;a href=\"Dragonhide\"&gt;Dragonhide&lt;/a&gt; Alteration spell or &lt;a href=\"Bones%20of%20the%20Earth\"&gt;Bones of the Earth&lt;/a&gt; All-Maker power, which negates 80% of physical damage, makes a character almost immune to damage.\nA &lt;a href=\"Vampirism%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;vampire&lt;/a&gt; taking the &lt;a href=\"Necromage%20%28Perk%29%23Affected%20spells%20and%20perks\"&gt;Necromage&lt;/a&gt; perk before taking both &lt;a href=\"Atronach%20%28Perk%29\"&gt;Atronach perk&lt;/a&gt; (37.5%) and Atronach Stone (62.5%) can reach a permanent 100% spell absorption.\nTips.\nAchieving 80% spell absorption, instead of the highest possible amount, might be beneficial if one wants to use spells from all schools of magic and still be able to use conjuration. When the Conjuration level reaches 100, all spells of that school will cost less. In this way, Conjuration spells can be used as a means to regenerate magicka, since when the spell is absorbed, it will give the player magicka equal to the base cost of the spell. The missing 20% spell absorption is preferred in this case, because there will still be a small chance of using master-level conjuration spells. It is also possible to deactivate the &lt;a href=\"The%20Atronach%20Stone%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Atronach Stone&lt;/a&gt; to use any master-level conjuration spell, then reactivate the stone."}

Peryite asks that the &lt;a href=\"Hero%20of%20Kvatch\"&gt;Hero&lt;/a&gt; travel to the plane of &lt;a href=\"Oblivion%20%28Realm%29\"&gt;Oblivion&lt;/a&gt; and retrieve their souls.\nThis shield is the reward through the completion of the quest (level 10+). It is a good way to earn quick money because of it is worth 16,500 , or an easy &lt;a href=\"Daedric%20artifact\"&gt;Daedric artifact&lt;/a&gt; to use in \"&lt;a href=\"Blood%20of%20the%20Daedra\"&gt;Blood of the Daedra&lt;/a&gt;.\"\nHistory.\nDuring the &lt;a href=\"Oblivion%20Crisis\"&gt;Oblivion Crisis&lt;/a&gt;, the Taskmaster asked the &lt;a href=\"Hero%20of%20Kvatch\"&gt;Hero of Kvatch&lt;/a&gt; to rescue the trapped souls of his followers. They were trying to reach the realm of &lt;a href=\"Peryite\"&gt;Peryite&lt;/a&gt;, but instead their souls were transported to another realm, most likely &lt;a href=\"Mehrunes%20Dagon\"&gt;Mehrunes Dagon&lt;/a&gt;'s as it was a time when Mehrunes Dagon was launching his attack on &lt;a href=\"Tamriel\"&gt;Tamriel&lt;/a&gt; from many small fiery realms as bases. The Champion of &lt;a href=\"Cyrodiil\"&gt;Cyrodiil&lt;/a&gt; was eventually successful and managed to rescue all of the trapped souls and return them to their bodies. Peryite rewarded the Champion with the &lt;a href=\"Dwemer\"&gt;Dwarven&lt;/a&gt; shield, &lt;a href=\"Spell%20Breaker\"&gt;Spell Breaker&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe shield was also rewarded by Peryite to the &lt;a href=\"Hero%20of%20Daggerfall\"&gt;Hero of Daggerfall&lt;/a&gt; decades earlier after completing a different contract for the &lt;a href=\"Daedric%20Prince\"&gt;Daedric Prince&lt;/a&gt;. It is unknown how Peryite managed to retrieve the Spellbreaker from each of its owners. The &lt;a href=\"Eternal%20Champion\"&gt;Eternal Champion&lt;/a&gt; was also one of the wielders of the Dwarven shield. He found the shield somewhere in &lt;a href=\"Hammerfell\"&gt;Hammerfell&lt;/a&gt; - which was perhaps the original location of the shield. The legend says:\nSpell Breaker, superficially a Dwarven tower shield, is one of the most ancient relics of Tamriel. Aside from its historic importance dating from the Battle of Rourken-Shalidor, the Spell Breaker protects its wielder almost completely from any spellcaster, either by dispelling magic or silencing any &lt;a href=\"Mage%20%28Class%29\"&gt;mage&lt;/a&gt; about to cast a &lt;a href=\"spell\"&gt;spell&lt;/a&gt;. It is said that the Spell Breaker still searches for its original owner, and will not remain the property of anyone else for long. For most, possessing Spell Breaker for any time is power enough.\nAccording to the text above, the tower shield has some connection with the &lt;a href=\"Dwemer\"&gt;Dwemer&lt;/a&gt; clan of Rourken, which was situated in Hammerfell. So it is highly possible for Hammerfell to be the original home of the tower shield, but the connection of Rourken and Peryite, is currently unknown."}

After throwing his ceremonial hammer known as &lt;a href=\"Volendrung\"&gt;Volendrung&lt;/a&gt;, which is also a Dwemer artifact and a &lt;a href=\"Daedric\"&gt;Daedric&lt;/a&gt;\u00a0artifact\u00a0which landed in modern-day &lt;a href=\"Hammerfell\"&gt;Hammerfell&lt;/a&gt;, he and his clan marched to what would be their new home. Along the way, they encountered &lt;a href=\"Shalidor\"&gt;Shalidor&lt;/a&gt;, and a battle ensued, which would come to be known as the &lt;a href=\"Battle%20of%20Rourken-Shalidor\"&gt;Battle of Rourken-Shalidor&lt;/a&gt;. During this battle, King Rourken used Spellbreaker against Shalidor.\nAcquisition.\nSpellbreaker is awarded by Peryite upon completing the &lt;a href=\"Daedric%20Quests%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Daedric quest&lt;/a&gt;\u00a0\"&lt;a href=\"The%20Only%20Cure\"&gt;The Only Cure&lt;/a&gt;.\"\nSmithing.\nSpellbreaker can be upgraded at a &lt;a href=\"workbench\"&gt;workbench&lt;/a&gt; with a &lt;a href=\"Dwarven%20Metal%20Ingot\"&gt;Dwarven metal ingot&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Arcane%20Blacksmith\"&gt;Arcane Blacksmith&lt;/a&gt; perk, however, it does not benefit from any &lt;a href=\"Smithing%20%28Skyrim%29%23Perks\"&gt;Smithing perks&lt;/a&gt;.\nThis means the shield cannot be improved past &lt;a href=\"Smithing%20%28Skyrim%29%23Improvement\"&gt;flawless&lt;/a&gt; quality without boosting the Smithing skill over 100. This can be achieved by using &lt;a href=\"Fortify%20Smithing%23Enchanting\"&gt;enchanted&lt;/a&gt; items and/or &lt;a href=\"Fortify%20Smithing%23Potions\"&gt;blacksmithing potions&lt;/a&gt; to &lt;a href=\"fortify%20Smithing\"&gt;fortify Smithing&lt;/a&gt;.\nEnchanting.\n&lt;a href=\"Block%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Blocking&lt;/a&gt; with this shield grants the following bonus:\nThe ward provides &lt;a href=\"magic\"&gt;magic&lt;/a&gt; protection only, and does not increase &lt;a href=\"Armor%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Armor&lt;/a&gt; Rating, unlike other Wards.\nThe effect refreshes itself every second that the user is blocking, though it takes a small amount of time to get the ward to charge up (about a second). The ward remains active a few seconds after blocking is ceased.\nAs Spellbreaker is a unique shield, it cannot be disenchanted to learn its effect.\nUsefulness.\nDragons.\nThe Spellbreaker Ward effect is extremely useful in fighting &lt;a href=\"Dragons%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;dragons&lt;/a&gt;, as it blocks all &lt;a href=\"Dragon%20Shouts\"&gt;breath&lt;/a&gt; attacks. The ward also protects against any other types of shouts that &lt;a href=\"Draugr%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;draugr&lt;/a&gt; may use. Wielding &lt;a href=\"Dragonbane\"&gt;Dragonbane&lt;/a&gt; and Spellbreaker is one of the best ways to fight dragons, due to the extra damage to dragons and ability to block their breath attacks.\nMages.\nFighting spell-casting foes, such as &lt;a href=\"Mage%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Mages&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Conjurer%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Conjurers&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Necromancer%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Necromancers&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Draugr%20Wight%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Draugr Wights&lt;/a&gt;, proves advantageous with Spellbreaker's resistance to magic.\nDragon Priests.\nWhen combined with the &lt;a href=\"Dawnbreaker%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Dawnbreaker&lt;/a&gt;, the Spellbreaker makes fighting &lt;a href=\"Dragon%20Priests%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Dragon Priests&lt;/a&gt; easier, due to Spellbreaker's resistance to magic and Dawnbreaker's damage bonuses to &lt;a href=\"Undead%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;undead&lt;/a&gt;.\nAs a ward.\nCombined with the &lt;a href=\"Elemental%20Protection%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Elemental Protection&lt;/a&gt; perk the shield renders most enemy-casted &lt;a href=\"Destruction%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Destruction&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"magic\"&gt;magic&lt;/a&gt; useless, as the perk halves the incoming damage, and the ward typically takes care of the rest. The shield seems more effective against spells that \"spray,\" such as &lt;a href=\"Sparks%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Sparks&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Flames%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Flames&lt;/a&gt;. When the ward is broken, the shield drops, meaning the shield cannot be used to block physical blows. Spellbreaker benefits from the &lt;a href=\"Restoration%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Restoration&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Restoration%20%28Skyrim%29%23Perks\"&gt;perk&lt;/a&gt;, Ward Absorb."}

A custom spell can have more than one effect (such as &lt;a href=\"Frost%20Damage\"&gt;frost&lt;/a&gt; \"and\" &lt;a href=\"Fire%20Damage\"&gt;fire damage&lt;/a&gt;). The magnitude of the effect is proportional to the &lt;a href=\"magicka\"&gt;magicka&lt;/a&gt; required to cast the spell. Multiple effects have compounding magicka requirements.\nUsage.\nSpellmakers.\nSpellmakers of the &lt;a href=\"Mages%20Guild\"&gt;Mages Guild&lt;/a&gt; provide services of spellmaking.\nAltar of Spellmaking.\nSpellmaking can be performed with an &lt;a href=\"Altar%20of%20Spellmaking%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;Altar of Spellmaking&lt;/a&gt;.\nEffects.\nEffects are only available if you already have a spell including that effect and the ability to cast that spell (both sufficient rank and sufficient magicka). Scrolls do not count.\nChoosing spell properties.\nYou can also set area damage and duration to a spell when selecting the damage. Along with that you may choose the range of the spell as either on touch, on target, or a spell on yourself (can determine amount of magicka needed). You may even mix and match spell types and schools, such as making a single spell that casts Charm on touch and Fortify Personality on self.\nIn general, &lt;a href=\"Destruction%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;Destruction&lt;/a&gt; spells that have a longer duration for the same final damage amount will cost less magicka to cast than one that deals the entire amount of damage over a single second. For example, a fire damage spell that does 50 damage over 1 second should cost more to cast than a spell that does 10 damage over 5 seconds. It is also possible to make a drain health spell that drains 100 damage that lasts for 1 second, meaning that anything with less than 101\u00a0hp will die instantly. The spell is cheap, though won't necessarily kill every thing, and is a very strong finishing blow on the weak.\nSome skills, such as &lt;a href=\"Armorer%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;Armorer&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Speechcraft%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;Speechcraft&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Mercantile%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;Mercantile&lt;/a&gt;, may be exploited by creating a spell that fortifies one's proficiency in that skill by 100 points for 1 second. Simply cast the spell and call on the menu related to that skill (repair menu for Armorer, barter menu for Mercantile) and enjoy the boosted stat. Such spells usually cost less than 20 magicka and may be cast by almost anyone. &lt;a href=\"Charm%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;Charm&lt;/a&gt; can be exploited in the same way.\nUp to eight fortifications (racial boosts, enchanted items employed, active spells) can be stacked. To stack spells, you must create \"different\" spells with the same fortification. Since spells take about 2 seconds to cast, stage the durations to be 2 seconds shorter for each successive spell in a sequence. Name the spells in alphabetical sequence, so after the 2nd spell the 3rd and subsequent spells will kindly be positioned under the cursor when tab is pressed to bring up your spells."}

The tablets may vary in quality, some being made from marble or runestone.\nTracing tablets.\nThe tablets are inscribed with the language that is shared with the runes of the &lt;a href=\"Enchanting%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Enchanting system&lt;/a&gt;. A tracing paper will be placed on the tablet, to which you must scrub charcoal upon in order to copy the tablet's information.\nLearning spells.\nWhen a spell's information is complete, it will be placed into a portfolio, with the spell tablet tracing on the left and the spell result drawn on the right. When activated anywhere in Tamriel, a spell-specific animation will occur, and you will learn the spell's attributes.\nCrafting spells.\nAt a spellcrafting station, the tablet effect is displayed in the middle. On the right, there are six spell categories to have applied to the spells: Base, Ultimate, Enduring, Reduce Cost, Ritual, and AOE (&lt;a href=\"Area%20of%20Effect\"&gt;Area of Effect&lt;/a&gt;).\nWhen a spell is partnered with one of the categories, the resulting spell will have the special keyword applied to it when cast. For example, putting \"enduring\" with \"conjure flame atronach\" will produce a permanent Flame Atronach follower, while combining it with AOE will have the atronach surrounded by a ring of flames when cast.\nSpells.\nThe following are spell attributes currently revealed:"}

This service is not limited to members of the &lt;a href=\"Mages%20Guild%20%28Morrowind%29\"&gt;Mages Guild&lt;/a&gt;, and is offered by numerous &lt;a href=\"Characters%20%28Morrowind%29\"&gt;people&lt;/a&gt; of various &lt;a href=\"Classes%20%28Morrowind%29\"&gt;classes&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Factions%20%28Morrowind%29\"&gt;factions&lt;/a&gt; throughout &lt;a href=\"Morrowind\"&gt;Morrowind&lt;/a&gt;. Unlike &lt;a href=\"Enchant%20%28Morrowind%29\"&gt;enchanting&lt;/a&gt;, spellmaking is not considered to be a &lt;a href=\"Skills%20%28Morrowind%29\"&gt;skill&lt;/a&gt; and can not be learned, or performed independently by the &lt;a href=\"Nerevarine\"&gt;Nerevarine&lt;/a&gt;.\nAcquiring effects.\nSpellmakers can craft spells with any effect from any school of magic (regardless of their magical expertise), but they do not have libraries of magical effects available. Only the client's known effects can be used to create a spell. Prior to retaining the services of a spellmaker to create a custom spell, the Nerevarine must first learn a spell consisting of a desired magical effect.\nSpells can be purchased from &lt;a href=\"Spell%20Merchants%20%28Morrowind%29\"&gt;merchants&lt;/a&gt;, or occasionally learned during &lt;a href=\"Quests%20%28Morrowind%29\"&gt;quests&lt;/a&gt;. A source spell's magnitude, duration, and other details are inconsequential to spellmaking, a known spell must simply consist of the desired effect. Note that possessing an item that is enchanted with a desired effect is not equivalent to knowing a spell with that effect.\nInterface.\nSpellmaking can be initiated by speaking with a spellmaker and selecting \"Spellmaking\" from the list of available services in the top-right corner. An interface box appears containing an area to name the spell, a list of known effects on the left, a list of selected effects on the right, as well as the spell's &lt;a href=\"Magicka%20%28Morrowind%29\"&gt;Magicka&lt;/a&gt; cost, estimated chance of success (varies with &lt;a href=\"Fatigue\"&gt;Fatigue&lt;/a&gt;), and the purchase &lt;a href=\"Septim%20%28Coin%29\"&gt;price&lt;/a&gt;.\nPlacing the cursor over a magical effect displays its description, while selecting it opens a second interface box. The effect's range, minimum magnitude, maximum magnitude, duration, and area are controlled here and must be set individually for each effect. The maximum duration for a custom spell is 1,440 seconds (24 minutes), and the maximum area permitted is 50 feet. As an effect's parameters are modified, the spell's Magicka cost, chance of success, and purchase price can be seen updating in the first interface box.\nUp to eight effects can be added and a name must be provided before purchasing the spell. A spell's purchase price is based on its potency, and is not negotiable or influenced by &lt;a href=\"disposition\"&gt;disposition&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Mercantile%20%28Morrowind%29\"&gt;Mercantile&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Personality%20%28Morrowind%29\"&gt;Personality&lt;/a&gt;, reputation, or &lt;a href=\"Speechcraft%20%28Morrowind%29\"&gt;Speechcraft&lt;/a&gt;.\nList of spellmakers.\nThe following is a list of Spellmakers in and expansion packs."}

However, it is also available to those who have the \"&lt;a href=\"Frostcrag%20Spire%20%28Location%29\"&gt;Frostcrag Spire&lt;/a&gt;\" plug-in, after purchasing the Magetallow Candles altar upgrade.\nBy using the &lt;a href=\"Altar%20of%20Spellmaking%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;Altar of Spellmaking&lt;/a&gt;, one is able to combine learned magical effects into custom spells, choosing range (on Self, on Touch, or on Target), area of effect (if appropriate), magnitude, and duration. These determine what is needed to create and use the spell: the minimum skill level required to cast, the spell's on-use &lt;a href=\"Magicka%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;Magicka&lt;/a&gt; cost, and the price in &lt;a href=\"Septim%20%28Coin%29\"&gt;gold&lt;/a&gt; to create it.\nThe spell cost is determined by the equation below:\n B = Base Cost / 10\n M = Magnitude ^ 1.28\n D = Duration\n A = Area \u00d7 0.15\n Total cost = B \u00d7 M \u00d7 D \u00d7 A\nIf M, D, or A is less than 1, a value of 1 should be used. The Magicka cost is further multiplied by 1.5 if the spell is a targeted spell. Base Cost is as defined in the construction set.\nThe cost is further adjusted on an individual basis by a multiplier given below:\n 1.4 - 0.012 \u00d7 Skill\nUseful tips to keep in mind.\n&lt;a href=\"Weakness%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;Weakness&lt;/a&gt; does not influence any &lt;a href=\"Damage%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;Damage&lt;/a&gt; effects that are included in the same spell. In other words, you must cast a Weakness spell first, then follow it up with a Damage spell to get the increased damage due to the Weakness effect.\u00a0\nWeakness can still raise Magicka efficiency. A 28 pts &lt;a href=\"Frost%20Damage%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;Frost Damage&lt;/a&gt; on touch spell costs 54 Magicka. However, a 100 pts &lt;a href=\"Weakness%20to%20Frost%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;Weakness to Frost&lt;/a&gt; (5 secs) effect followed by a 20 pts Frost Damage on touch delivers 40 pts of Frost Damage (a 100% increase) with the same base cost of 54 Magicka.\nWhen casting a spell which includes a &lt;a href=\"Weakness%20to%20Magic%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;Weakness to Magic&lt;/a&gt; effect on a target already affected by Weakness to Magic, the original Weakness to Magic effect will affect all effects in the spell up to and including the Weakness to Magic effect. Effects listed after the Weakness to Magic effect will not be altered, therefore it is generally best to make sure that the Weakness to Magic effect is listed last in any spells you create.\nIf combining &lt;a href=\"Soul%20Trap%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;Soul Trap&lt;/a&gt; and Damage in the same spell, the Soul Trap effect must be listed first.\nYou cannot include more than one of the same effect in a single spell. For effects which manipulate skills or attributes, the skill or attribute in question alone doesn't differentiate the effect. For example, you can't make a custom spell with both Fortify Athletics and Fortify Acrobatics effects, because they are both &lt;a href=\"Fortify%20Skill%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;Fortify Skill&lt;/a&gt; effects. However, you could combine Fortify Athletics with &lt;a href=\"Fortify%20Speed%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;Fortify Speed&lt;/a&gt;, because the latter is a &lt;a href=\"Fortify%20Attribute%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;Fortify Attribute&lt;/a&gt; effect. You could also create a Fortify Athletics and Absorb Athletics spell, because Fortify and &lt;a href=\"Absorb\"&gt;Absorb&lt;/a&gt; are different effects.\nDue to the magnitude factor being raised to a power, a spell with a long duration is cheaper than a short-duration with the same total magnitude. For example, 10pts &lt;a href=\"Fire%20Damage%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;Fire Damage&lt;/a&gt; for 6 seconds is cheaper than 60 pts Fire Damage for 1 second.\nOne implication of this fact is that combining multiple similar effects may result in a cheaper spell than a spell with just one strong effect. As an example, 20pts Fire Damage + 20 pts Frost Damage + 20 pts &lt;a href=\"Shock%20Damage%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;Shock Damage&lt;/a&gt; is a cheaper spell than 60 pts Fire Damage, while doing the same amount of damage to a target with no elemental affinities.\nSpells with different names can be simultaneously active, even if the spells do exactly the same thing. This is a way to get around the 100 point maximum magnitude for spell effects.\nWhen a window is opened, or a conversation is started, any spell effects remain active indefinitely until the window is closed, or the conversation ends. In this way you can use \"Fortify Sneak 100 pts for 1 second\" to pickpocket almost anything, \"&lt;a href=\"Charm%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;Charm&lt;/a&gt; 100 pts for 1 second\" to maximize &lt;a href=\"disposition\"&gt;disposition&lt;/a&gt;, etc.\nIt can be particularly effective to combine some effects with &lt;a href=\"Invisibility%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;Invisibility&lt;/a&gt;. For example, a Conjure plus Invisible spell will allow your conjured creature to deal damage while you remain safely hidden. Another tactic is to combine an Invisibility effect with an area Frenzy effect to incite a riot among your attackers leaving you untouched.\nAlthough it may be tempting to create the most powerful spell possible, it is a much better idea to create ones with lesser costs. This way, you can cast it much more frequently, you are less likely to 'overkill' a target and it allows you to split the damage among several enemies should the situation allow. With a high &lt;a href=\"Willpower%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;Willpower&lt;/a&gt;, Novice level spells can almost be cast continuously."}

Spells can also be used against the &lt;a href=\"Fugitive%20%28Blades%29\"&gt;Fugitive&lt;/a&gt; in combat by various &lt;a href=\"Characters%20%28Blades%29\"&gt;characters&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Creatures%20%28Blades%29\"&gt;creatures&lt;/a&gt; including &lt;a href=\"Dragons%20%28Blades%29\"&gt;dragons&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Necromancer%20%28Blades%29\"&gt;necromancer&lt;/a&gt;s, and casters. Different enemies will have unique and different animations or ways they move while performing certain spells. For example, dragons have unique spells where they fly up into the air and breath elemental &lt;a href=\"Damage%20%28Blades%29\"&gt;damage&lt;/a&gt; while being immune to physical attacks. Spell ranks can be increased by equipping &lt;a href=\"Enchanting%20%28Blades%29\"&gt;enchanted&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Jewelry%20%28Blades%29\"&gt;jewelry&lt;/a&gt; and can be permanently improved upon by spending skill points.\nEffects.\nThe effects of spells typically deal elemental damage among other conditions such as avoiding damage with a ward; negating damage with an ice shield; healing; and stunning, paralysing, or blinding a target. Spells do not require weapons or shields to cast but, unlike most &lt;a href=\"Abilities%20%28Blades%29\"&gt;abilities&lt;/a&gt;, will require time to cast, giving the enemy time to counter. Spells can be countered simply by damaging the caster as they prepare the spell.\nUsage.\nEnemies are effective at countering spells and will often change abilities mid-move to counter a setup by the Fugitive. Some, such as undead enemies, do not counter well or have little variance between attacks, making them vulnerable to receiving damage and status effects from spells.\nHowever, &lt;a href=\"Goblin%20%28Blades%29\"&gt;goblins&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Mercenary%20%28Blades%29\"&gt;mercenaries&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Bandits%20%28Blades%29\"&gt;bandits&lt;/a&gt;, and some other enemies can be less predictable, requiring the Fugitive to be more precise and better choreograph their opponent in order to successfully cast spells. Countering enemy spells requires different tactics in every fight, as a goblin may save or chain skills to use particular skills as the counter to certain spells or abilities."}

Magicka and magicka regeneration potions and enchantments can be used to counter this.\nUsing \"Skyrim\"'s &lt;a href=\"dual-wielding\"&gt;dual-wielding&lt;/a&gt; mechanics, it is possible to dual-wield any two spells of the same type together for a more powerful version, or wield as one spell with a one-handed tool such as a &lt;a href=\"Shields%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;shield&lt;/a&gt; or a &lt;a href=\"Weapons%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;weapon&lt;/a&gt;. This does not work for certain spells, such as Master spells, as they must be cast with two hands (e.g &lt;a href=\"Fire%20Storm\"&gt;Fire Storm&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Summon%20Unbound%20Dremora\"&gt;Summon Unbound Dremora&lt;/a&gt;).\nSchools.\nAs in previous entries, spells in \"Skyrim\" are split into different &lt;a href=\"Schools%20of%20magic\"&gt;Schools&lt;/a&gt; of magic depending on their use. \"Skyrim\" features 5 different schools that serve as skills under the sign of &lt;a href=\"The%20Mage\"&gt;The Mage&lt;/a&gt;.\n&lt;a href=\"Destruction%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Destruction&lt;/a&gt;.\nDestruction spells focus on delivering damage to opponents, commonly using elemental forces such as flame, frost or shock. Flame spells burn dealing extra damage, frost spells damage the target's &lt;a href=\"Stamina%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;stamina&lt;/a&gt;, and shock spells damage the target's &lt;a href=\"Magicka%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;magicka&lt;/a&gt;. Destruction is used to cast spells like &lt;a href=\"Flames%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Flames&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Ice%20Spike%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Ice Spike&lt;/a&gt;.\n&lt;a href=\"Restoration%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Restoration&lt;/a&gt;.\nRestoration spells focus on the healing of injuries and manipulation of life energies. These generally include healing spells and wards. All Fortification enchantments also fall into the Restoration school. Restoration is used to cast spells like &lt;a href=\"Healing\"&gt;Healing&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Repel%20Undead\"&gt;Repel Undead&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Greater%20Ward\"&gt;Greater Ward&lt;/a&gt;.\n&lt;a href=\"Conjuration%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Conjuration&lt;/a&gt;.\nConjuration spells focus on summoning creatures and weapons from one of the &lt;a href=\"planes%20of%20Oblivion\"&gt;planes of Oblivion&lt;/a&gt; and raising the dead. &lt;a href=\"Soul%20Trap%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Soul Trap&lt;/a&gt; also falls under this school. Conjuration is used to cast spells like &lt;a href=\"Conjure%20Storm%20Atronach\"&gt;Conjure Storm Atronach&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Bound%20Sword%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Bound Sword&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Raise%20Zombie\"&gt;Raise Zombie&lt;/a&gt;.\n&lt;a href=\"Illusion%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Illusion&lt;/a&gt;.\nIllusion spells focus on influencing the behavior of enemies, and is used to cast spells like &lt;a href=\"Fear%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Fear&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Calm%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Calm&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Invisibility%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Invisibility&lt;/a&gt;.\n&lt;a href=\"Alteration%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Alteration&lt;/a&gt;.\nAlteration spells focus on altering the physical world, and is probably the most versatile in its effects compared to the other schools. Alteration is used to cast spells like &lt;a href=\"Detect%20Life\"&gt;Detect Life&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Ironflesh\"&gt;Magic Armor&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Transmute%20Mineral%20Ore\"&gt;Transmutation&lt;/a&gt;.\nAcquisition.\nAt the beginning of \"Skyrim\", only two spells are available (with the exception of certain &lt;a href=\"Races%20%28Skyrim%29%23Starting%20spells%20by%20race\"&gt;races&lt;/a&gt;); &lt;a href=\"Flames%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Flames&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Healing\"&gt;Healing&lt;/a&gt;. Other spells must be learned through the use of &lt;a href=\"Spell%20Tomes%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;spell tomes&lt;/a&gt; which can be found around the world or purchased from &lt;a href=\"Spell%20Merchants%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;vendors&lt;/a&gt;.

Spellswords specialize in combat and magic so race is not detrimental in building your very own as no race's bonuses encompass all skills that are commonly found in a spellsword's armory.\nSpellswords should try and maximize their ranged magic spells against melee enemies until they are close. When fighting enemies that use bows or crossbows, a combination of blade and destruction magic can be very useful especially if you time your attacks and stagger the opponent when right about to let loose an arrow or bolt. Against magic users, using magicka-draining spells is a very effective strategy, but dispatching the mage inside a group should be a priority as a spellsword."}

A young woman by the name of &lt;a href=\"Hanu\"&gt;Hanu&lt;/a&gt; arrived in &lt;a href=\"Tel%20Mora%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Tel Mora&lt;/a&gt;, demanding to speak to me. Out of mere curiosity, I allowed her request.\nHanu's question was quickly and simply asked; how could she enter &lt;a href=\"Hircine%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Hircine's&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Hunting%20Grounds\"&gt;Hunting Grounds&lt;/a&gt;?\nI, of course, first suggested a life of hearty worship of the &lt;a href=\"Daedric%20Prince\"&gt;Daedric Prince&lt;/a&gt;, followed by a heroic death. She shook her head, obviously frustrated. Her wish was to enter the Daedric realm alive, and leave in just the same fashion. An intriguing request, but one I had difficulty understanding. Of all the realms in &lt;a href=\"Oblivion%20%28Realm%29\"&gt;Oblivion&lt;/a&gt;, what did the Hunting Grounds have to offer an Aslander who did not devote themselves to Hircine?\nFinally, Hanu began to wax sentimental. Her cool fa\u00e7ade crumbled as she spoke upon the matter of saving her father's spirit. A shame. She seemed like such a levelheaded young woman. Still, her vast knowledge of Daedrology intrigued me all the same.\nI agreed to help, on the basis that Hanu would share her knowledge once she had returned. The firsthand observation of a Daedric realm is something I could not possibly pass up. And to that end, how lucky was it that I should have just reviewed &lt;a href=\"Pelagius%20Habor\"&gt;Pelagius Habor&lt;/a&gt;'s dissertation on the Great Hunt?\nAll I needed was a fresh &lt;a href=\"Wolf%20%28Online%29\"&gt;wolf&lt;/a&gt; corpse. Dissecting its stomach allowed me to read its innards, revealing the location of the next Great Hunt. And, once again, how fortunate for Hanu that such a hunt was to occur in only a few weeks' time. It almost seemed as if some divine presence was easing her path.\nStill, I'll not hold my breath; very few return from Hircine's March of Sacrifices."}

This entry was &lt;a href=\"https%3A//www.elderscrollsonline.com/en-us/news/post/26387\"&gt;published&lt;/a&gt; on 05/09/2018.\nContents.\nA Report by &lt;a href=\"Oriandra\"&gt;Oriandra&lt;/a&gt;, Acolyte of the &lt;a href=\"Psijic%20Order%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Psijic Order&lt;/a&gt;\n&lt;a href=\"Ritemaster%20Iachesis\"&gt;Ritemaster Iachesis&lt;/a&gt;,\nYou tasked me with studying one of our most accomplished sages, the always calm and composed &lt;a href=\"Valsirenn\"&gt;Valsirenn&lt;/a&gt; of the Conclave of the Eleven Forces. You said that I could gain insights that would help in my own training and advancement, and after spending numerous weeks either working at Valsirenn's side or observing her from afar, I once again marvel at your ability always to point me in the right direction.\nAs you know, Valsirenn joined the Psijic Order after you saw potential in the young &lt;a href=\"Altmer%20%28Online%29\"&gt;High Elf&lt;/a&gt;. I find it hard to believe that Valsirenn was ever young and inexperienced, but of course we are talking about a time that was more than three hundred years ago. This was when our island home of &lt;a href=\"Artaeum%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Artaeum&lt;/a&gt; still floated off the coast of &lt;a href=\"Summerset%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Summerset&lt;/a&gt;, before the Order made it vanish from the world. From what I was able to learn, Valsirenn represented the best and brightest of her age. She could have chosen any of numerous paths open before her, though it seems she didn't even take the traditional year and a day to consider your offer. Like me many years later, she accepted the invitation to join the Order almost as soon as you extended it.\nValsirenn became a monk of the Old Ways early in her life and grew in power and prestige within the confines of Artaeum and &lt;a href=\"Ceporah%20Tower%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Ceporah Tower&lt;/a&gt;. As a Psijic sage, she gravitated toward scholarly pursuits and arcane research, developing into one of the Order's foremost experts on mysticism and esoteric knowledge. She became a teacher who never lost her intellectual curiosity. If anything, it grew in intensity and focus as the years passed. She met the love of her life, &lt;a href=\"Leythen\"&gt;Leythen&lt;/a&gt;, another sage, here on Artaeum. And, as respect and admiration for her work evolved, she was invited to join the Conclave of the Eleven Forces\u2014the ruling committee of the Psijic Order.\nValsirenn found time to not only become a driving force in the Psijic Order, an accomplished researcher, and your most-trusted associate, she also developed a loving relationship and started a family with Leythen. As you know, she sometimes leaves the island to conduct research back on &lt;a href=\"Nirn\"&gt;Nirn&lt;/a&gt; or to complete missions for you or the Conclave. She even allowed me to accompany her a few times, which gave me the opportunity to make contact with other mages back in &lt;a href=\"Tamriel\"&gt;Tamriel&lt;/a&gt;. Sharing information that the Psijic Order doesn't consider confidential has been helpful in my own research, for example.\nNow, as much as I have come to admire her, Valsirenn isn't perfect. She often gets so absorbed in her own work that she ignores everything else going on around her. I've seen her spend days on end in one of our libraries or workrooms, forgetting to eat or sleep or even interact with any of her friends or family. I wouldn't say that she's cold, exactly, but I know that some of the Order think of her that way. And her confidence and vast expanse of knowledge can look like pride and arrogance to some, especially to those on the wrong end of one of her lectures or scholarly debates.\nWhat else can I say about Valsirenn of the Psijic Order? She presents herself as calm and composed, always on top of every situation. Although she is significantly older than I am, I have never seen Valsirenn as anything less than a vital, caring, and dedicated member of our exclusive community. Her intellectual prowess and scholarly pursuits are legendary among the Order. She is completely devoted to the Old Ways and her fellow Psijics, though sometimes her seriousness and work-oriented approach can be disconcerting to those who aren't used to her ways.\nValsirenn shows me that learning never stops. And she teaches me not just through her lectures and lessons, but with every action she performs as she goes about her daily routine. I look forward to working with her again in the very near future!"}

You did not exaggerate. Everything you said about him is absolutely true.\nFirst, a little history so you know I actually did my due diligence. Your despised half-brother was born in 2E 418, which makes him exceedingly long lived at the ripe old age of 164. Makes me wish I had taken up magic when I was setting out to find my way in the world. Ah, well.\nAs the aristocratic and overbearing patriarch of the &lt;a href=\"House%20Tharn\"&gt;Tharn family&lt;/a&gt; and the Imperial Overlord of &lt;a href=\"Nibenay\"&gt;Nibenay&lt;/a&gt;, Abnur has led a storied life. His early years remain something of a mystery, though I assume that much of his first 40 or so years on &lt;a href=\"Nirn\"&gt;Nirn&lt;/a&gt; were taken up with the usual education and experiences of someone of high noble birth, as well as his training in various arcane arts. We know he excelled at battle magic, but he only really stepped onto the stage of history when he became an advisor to the succession of kings and emperors who attempted to hold the Cyrodilic Empire together in the turbulent decades following the murder of the last &lt;a href=\"Akavir\"&gt;Akavir&lt;/a&gt;i &lt;a href=\"Potentate\"&gt;Potentate&lt;/a&gt;. By 2E 465, he was granted the title of Grand Chancellor of the &lt;a href=\"Elder%20Council\"&gt;Elder Council&lt;/a&gt;, and for the next 117 years, Abnur provided continuity and consistency. He retained that position until the most-recent collapse of the Imperial government. He continues to demonstrate a fierce loyalty to both the Empire and the idea of the Empire, though I expect that stems more from a sense of self-importance than any real love of king and country.\nAs I\u2019m sure you\u2019re aware, your half-brother has an extensive family, consisting of at least sixteen children, seven wives, and a number of siblings, including your royal majesty. Ever a smarmy dealmaker, he even helped place &lt;a href=\"Varen%20Aquilarios%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Varen Aquilarios&lt;/a&gt; on the &lt;a href=\"Ruby%20Throne\"&gt;Ruby Throne&lt;/a&gt; in exchange for Varen\u2019s agreement to marry his daughter, &lt;a href=\"Clivia\"&gt;Clivia&lt;/a&gt;. As one of Varen\u2019s most-trusted Five Companions, Abnur joined &lt;a href=\"Lyris%20Titanborn%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Lyris Titanborn&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Sai%20Sahan%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Sai Sahan&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Mannimarco%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Mannimarco&lt;/a&gt; in Varen\u2019s quest to recover the lost &lt;a href=\"Amulet%20of%20Kings%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Amulet of Kings&lt;/a&gt;. While I haven\u2019t been able to confirm it, I suspect that Abnur and the &lt;a href=\"Five%20Companions\"&gt;Five Companions&lt;/a&gt; had a hand in the dreaded &lt;a href=\"Soulburst\"&gt;Soulburst&lt;/a&gt; and the subsequent disappearance of Varen Aquilarios about four years back.\nYour half-brother is a wily old wizard and consummate politician. He was the de facto power behind the Ruby Throne for most of the time he served as the head of the Elder Council. His management of your family\u2019s affairs has expanded the wealth and power of the Tharn name by leaps and bounds, though I\u2019m sure you could do better in his stead. He speaks with a natural authority (I would say pompous) and often directs verbal jabs and barbs at those he considers to be his inferior\u2014and that happens to be almost everybody. He believes himself to be the smartest person in the room, and he is often the most ruthless (present company notwithstanding). I admit it: Abnur Tharn isn\u2019t someone I\u2019d ever turn my back on. Not for even an instant.\nAbnur Tharn represents the best and worst aspects of an Empire that no longer exists. He is vain, proud, and set in his ways. He thinks he knows best and goes to great lengths to make sure that everyone in his general vicinity completely understands this. He can be relentless and persuasive, alternately cajoling and threatening in equal measure. Beneath his aristocratic polish lies an ever-present undercurrent of menace. He remains a wily old tiger of a man\u2014elegant, subtle, and dangerous. I can see why you have no love for your half-brother. I think the man would drive me to thoughts of murder in very short order. Unfortunately, as good as I am, I have no illusions about being able to stand for long against a battlemage of Abnur\u2019s caliber. Even at his advanced age, he\u2019s only now showing signs of slowing down, and I have no doubt that he remains a force to be reckoned with. However, therein lies the path to getting exactly what your majesty most desires.\nAbnur loves having a mystery or problem to solve. Long years of devising strategies and advising emperors on all sorts of topics, I suppose. If you give him something to figure out, he will grab onto it like a dog with a bone and not release it until the situation is resolved. It\u2019s a part of his nature. Provide a tempting mystery, point your half-brother at the problem you need dealt with, and stand back and watch him go. Add to that his burning desire to end the &lt;a href=\"Three%20Banners%20War\"&gt;Three Banners War&lt;/a&gt; and reunite the Empire, and everything you need falls nicely into place. I have no doubt he will perform exactly as you expect and accomplish precisely what you need him to do.\nOf course, if he later determines that you were the one who tricked him, well, please make sure my payment is sent with all due speed.\nArctus Cove, Imperial Spymaster-at-Large"}

The faithful who regularly read our weekly missives have been asking to learn more about the &lt;a href=\"Dunmer%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Dunmer&lt;/a&gt; who keeps the Temple and the city running smoothly.\n&lt;a href=\"Archcanon%20Tarvus\"&gt;Archcanon Tarvus&lt;/a&gt;: &lt;a href=\"Vivec%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Lord Vivec&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Tribunal%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Tribunal&lt;/a&gt; keep the wheels turning. I am merely their servant.\nAdjuvant Drumara: Modest, as always! How did you find your way to a life of religious service?\nArchcanon Tarvus: I grew up in &lt;a href=\"House%20Indoril%20%28Online%29\"&gt;House Indoril&lt;/a&gt;, so while a role in the Temple wasn't guaranteed, it was certainly strongly encouraged. I found that the words of the Warrior-Poet moved me, and I quickly gravitated toward serving Lord Vivec. Here's a secret few people know\u2014I almost dedicated myself to the &lt;a href=\"Buoyant%20Armiger%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Buoyant Armigers&lt;/a&gt;. The call to adventure appealed to my younger self, and I even fancied myself something of a poet. Lord Vivec, however, had other plans for me.\nAdjuvant Drumara: So it's true that Lord Vivec himself recruited you into his priesthood?\nArchcanon Tarvus: Let's not make the story more significant than the reality. I was a young acolyte, training for a life of service in the Temple. When the time came to choose a path, Lord Vivec talked to me and suggested I would do better in the priesthood than as a swashbuckling Armiger or a militaristic &lt;a href=\"Ordinator%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Ordinator&lt;/a&gt;. I meditated on my choice and discovered, deep in my heart, that I agreed with him.\nAdjuvant Drumara: And then you demonstrated a real talent for both spiritual and administrative labors, rising to become the youngest canon ever to attain the rank of archcanon?\nArchcanon Tarvus: Young? I suppose so. But that was so long ago. I worked hard, constantly demonstrating my devotion to Vivec, the Three, and the people of &lt;a href=\"Morrowind%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Morrowind&lt;/a&gt;. That Lord Vivec saw fit to reward me with this honor and this responsibility, well, you'd have to ask him why I of all the canons was ultimately selected to replace my predecessor. I am just grateful for the opportunity to help my Lord and serve my Temple.\nAdjuvant Drumara: Your sermons on the dangers of outlanders in &lt;a href=\"Vvardenfell%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Vvardenfell&lt;/a&gt; can be quite stirring. Do you think our land really faces a threat from those who come with different cultures and beliefs?\nArchcanon Tarvus: For a minor priest and functionary, you tend to ask leading questions. My views on outlanders, however, are quite well known and completely consistent. No one other than the Dark Elves can claim such a unique relationship as we have with our Living Gods. That gives us a perspective and outlook on life that is, in fact, superior to every other culture in &lt;a href=\"Tamriel\"&gt;Tamriel&lt;/a&gt;. We are stronger when we are pure, when our culture isn't polluted by the thoughts and ideas of the lesser peoples. But other than that, I have nothing against the occasional outlander visiting our fair and beautiful island of Vvardenfell. \u201cTo challenge the strange allows us to know our strength,\" as the Warrior-Poet has written.\nAdjuvant Drumara: One of your closest aides, &lt;a href=\"Canon%20Llevule%20Andrano\"&gt;Canon Llevule Andrano&lt;/a&gt;, has been quoted as saying that you \u201ccarry the burden of Lord Vivec and the entire palace atop your shoulders.\" Do you agree with his assessment?\nArchcanon Tarvus: Is it a burden to serve the Warrior-Poet? Is it an obligation to make sure the business of the palace and the Temple and the city progresses smoothly and without stumble? I do what I do for my love of the Tribunal and its people. That is not a burden, Adjuvant Drumara, that is a rare and singular privilege! I do my best to instill that same attitude in all of the priests that serve under my administration. You would do well to remember that, as I am quite certain you fit into that category.\nAdjuvant Drumara: Of course, Archcanon Tarvus. I simply asked so that I could quote you accurately. May I ask one more question before we conclude this interview?\nArchcanon Tarvus: If you must.\nAdjuvant Drumara: How is the work on Vivec City coming along?\nArchcanon Tarvus: Construction on Lord Vivec's metropolis proceeds just as the Warrior-Poet has commanded. The cantons take shape like islands in the bay. The ziggurats rise as though to touch &lt;a href=\"Baar%20Dau%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Baar Dau&lt;/a&gt; itself. It is already a masterpiece, and it is not yet nearly half done! &lt;a href=\"Vivec%20City%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Vivec City&lt;/a&gt; is already the envy of every other nation in Tamriel. Imagine the accolades we shall receive as it nears completion! Now, if we're done here, I have the business of Lord Vivec to get back to."}

You can see it in her eyes, in the deep creases of her face. She really needs to take better care of herself. On certain days, she looks every bit as old as she is. She could still gut me like a fish, hollow me out, and turn my empty skin into a backpack, but that doesn't change the fact that she isn't getting any younger. I wonder if I should recommend a lotion to help with that? A combination of &lt;a href=\"Troll%20Fat%20%28Online%29\"&gt;troll fat&lt;/a&gt;, river mud, and &lt;a href=\"Alik%27r%20Desert%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Alik'r&lt;/a&gt; spices certainly keeps my scales supple and shiny.\n&lt;a href=\"Fredas\"&gt;Fredas&lt;/a&gt;\nI've been trying to better understand our Matron, but in many ways she remains a mystery to me. She holds herself apart and above the Brothers and Sisters that operate out of this Sanctuary, even as she worries and frets over each assassin she sends on a contract. She is definitely cold and calculating, an accomplished killer with a reputation for completing contracts faster and more efficiently than anyone else of her age category. She's probably lost a step or two, but I have no doubt her blade remains sharp and her aim deadly. Why does she insist on projecting such a hard shell, I wonder, when it's obvious she's as soft as yolk on the inside? I want to ask her, but the last time I broached the subject she threatened to cut out my tongue and hang it on the Black Door if I didn't stop bothering her with personal questions.\nI spent part of the day following the Matron around the Sanctuary, hoping to glean more insights into her motivations and character. Even a cold-blooded killer can be curious, after all.\nAstara took her morning meal in the mess, as she is wont to do. She had a large bowl of wine-soaked corn cake and chunks of wheel-barrow cheese. Interesting how she would spear a bit of cake or cheese with her knife, examine it carefully, and then plop it into her mouth. She chewed each mouthful eleven times\u2014never more, never less\u2014swallowed, then belched enthusiastically before diving in for more. She finished all but a sliver of cake and a wedge of cheese and departed just as &lt;a href=\"Tanek\"&gt;Tanek&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Cimbar\"&gt;Cimbar&lt;/a&gt; entered. I was tempted to stay behind to see what the assassins were going to eat, but that would have conflicted with my observations of the Matron. Perhaps tomorrow.\nI quietly followed the Matron into the library, where she continued her morning ritual of reading from \"&lt;a href=\"The%20Five%20Tenets%20%28Dark%20Brotherhood%29\"&gt;The Five Tenets&lt;/a&gt;\" and then, when she assumed no one was watching, she picked up one of her beloved bawdy tales. I couldn't see which it was today. Probably \"&lt;a href=\"Investigator%20Vale\"&gt;Investigator Vale&lt;/a&gt;\" or \"Tales of the Pirate Empress\" if I had to guess. She does seem to enjoy a rollicking bodice ripper whenever she can get her hands on one. At that point, without even turning to look, she hurled a dagger. It buried itself in the wall beside my head, less than a claw's length from my right ear.\nAnd so concluded my observations of Matron Astara for the day."}

My friend and comrade, Captain Midara, is dead. He had managed to evade capture for more than a month, but it seems the &lt;a href=\"Clannfear%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Clannfear&lt;/a&gt; finally sniffed him out. Even the oppressive stink of the sewers can't throw them off.\nThis is, of course, just another in a long line of tragedies. The &lt;a href=\"Imperial%20City%20%28Online%29\"&gt;city&lt;/a&gt; lies in ruins, its people are enslaved or sacrificed, and the &lt;a href=\"Imperial%20Legion%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Legion&lt;/a&gt; is shattered beyond repair. By last count, only two officers remain: myself and &lt;a href=\"Captain%20Anatolius%20Caudex\"&gt;Captain Anatolius Caudex&lt;/a&gt;. \nI remain baffled by Caudex's success in the &lt;a href=\"Nobles%20District\"&gt;Nobles District&lt;/a&gt;. While we scurry through drainpipes and sleep in puddles of our own filth, he holds the forum. The forum! Right there in plain view of Divine and &lt;a href=\"Daedra%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Daedra&lt;/a&gt; alike. I guess I shouldn't be surprised. In my heart, I've always known he'd be the last soldier standing. Sergeant Shatabi calls him the \u201cZhazza-Ra.\" That's &lt;a href=\"ta%27agra\"&gt;ta'agra&lt;/a&gt; for \u201cThe Crazy General.\" I suppose he does suffer from a kind of madness. His love for the Empire is just \u2026 relentless. It's the kind of zeal that would burst the heart of lesser men. He would bleed on the Diamond to keep it red.\nI'm reminded of our time in Fort Warden\u2014before the provincials took it from us. The &lt;a href=\"Daggerfall%20Covenant\"&gt;Covenant&lt;/a&gt; made a practice of shooting any officer that strayed into view. Most of us took to wearing standard infantry uniforms to avoid attention. But not Caudex. Every morning he'd polish his breastplate, comb the crest of his helm, and patrol the walls in utter defiance. He was shot three times, but never failed to make his rounds. We pleaded with him to stop. He just shook his head. \n\u201cThese rebels must learn that the Empire is invincible,\" he said. \u201cSo we must be invincible.\"\nNot long afterward, we were ordered to abandon the keep. Caudex was the last to leave.\nIt's funny. Even though I write this from inside the city walls, it feels like Fort Warden all over again. Enemies on all sides, officers in hiding, and Caudex defiant. I know that the city is lost. I know that the Legion is sundered. But in my heart I can't help but believe\u2014so long as Caudex lives, the Empire is invincible."}

Do you remember &lt;a href=\"Bazrag%20gro-Fharun\"&gt;Bazrag gro-Fharun&lt;/a&gt;? I'm sure you do! He was as quiet as Kurog was loud, but just as deadly with a sword or axe. This one-time friend and ally of King Kurog is now a clan chieftain. But despite their history, Bazrag refuses to accept Kurog's rule. He's a stubborn old hardliner, and perhaps the most prominent of the chiefs who still haven't given Kurog their full support. When Bazrag followed Kurog on his mercenary adventures, he battled across &lt;a href=\"Tamriel\"&gt;Tamriel&lt;/a&gt; at Kurog's side. Now he takes his role as clan chief very seriously, always keeping the needs of &lt;a href=\"Wrothgar%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Wrothgar&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Orsimer%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Orcs&lt;/a&gt; clearly at the forefront of all his endeavors.\nChief Bazrag considers the old customs and traditions to be sacrosanct. He's a firm believer in &lt;a href=\"Malacath%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Malacath&lt;/a&gt; and the Blood Code. A proud and accomplished Orc, he wants to see the rise of a new Orc empire as much as Kurog does. However, Bazrag thinks the process will take generations and can't be hurried along\u2014no matter how many cities Kurog decides to raise. To his mind, patience and adherence to tradition are the keys to uniting the clans and rebuilding Orsinium. Anything else is the addled dream of a reckless fool that threatens the glimmer of hope he sees for his people's future.\nGruff and serious, Chief Bazrag refuses to accept a new god or a new approach to life for the Orsimer. The old ways have served the Orcs well, Bazrag believes, and abandoning them for &lt;a href=\"Trinimac\"&gt;Trinimac&lt;/a&gt; and his ideas about truth, honor, and unity is anathema. In fact, I've heard Bazrag proclaim that the Trinimac movement is nothing more than a plot by the &lt;a href=\"Altmer%20%28Online%29\"&gt;High Elves&lt;/a&gt; to spread their own religion to Wrothgar. I'm sure he's just being paranoid, but I have noticed an increasing number of High Elves arriving in Orsinium.\nMy king, as a chief and opponent of Kurog, Bazrag needs to be handled very carefully. If King Kurog has an equal among the clan chiefs, it is Bazrag gro-Fharun. He has the support of the chiefs still opposed to Kurog's plans. He never displays the slightest bit of fear when confronting Kurog. And his stern and regal bearing keeps the traditionalist Orcs flocked around his banner. He's definitely a force to be reckoned with among those who initiate events and inspire influence in Wrothgar.\n&lt;a href=\"Zephrine%20Frey\"&gt;Zephrine Frey&lt;/a&gt;, Royal Chronicler of Wayrest"}

This is in no way a threat to your Majesty; in fact, it would seem Falorah is taking pains to preclude any embarrassment to the crown itself by preventing official entanglements with the merchant lords of Abah's Landing.\nFor your edification, I have prepared a brief dossier on &lt;a href=\"Chief%20Inspector%20Rhanbiq\"&gt;Chief Inspector Rhanbiq&lt;/a&gt;, the man beholden to complete Falorah's task.\nRhanbiq is one of the Iron Wheel's few chief inspectors, and by all accounts earned the title through unassailable duty and competence rather than family name or political connections. We place Rhanbiq in the middle to latter half of his fourth decade. He has no known living relatives and has never married. He cannot be bribed, he has no known vices, and numerous (but unconfirmed) reports indicate he is a private but devout adherent of &lt;a href=\"Stendarr\"&gt;Stendarr&lt;/a&gt;. His martial capabilities are passable, at best. As one of his colleagues says, \u201cthe only weapon Rhanbiq wields is his mind\u2014but he keeps it razor sharp.\"\nWe have learned the chief inspector is not native to Taneth. He transferred here two decades ago from the &lt;a href=\"Sentinel%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Sentinel&lt;/a&gt; branch of the Bailiffs Guild, which has always been a pale shadow of the Taneth branch in terms of capability and expertise. He quickly flourished under the tutelage of then-Inspector Braswila, and was personally involved in some rather high-profile investigations:\nWhen the Bailiffs Guild effectively collapsed during the Imperial troubles, Rhanbiq argued passionately to retain the structure of the Taneth branch for what I can only deem as idealistic interests. I have provided an excerpt:\n\"We cannot disband. We should not disband! We are not the watchmen wielding the cudgel of a bounty paid to make a problem simply go away. We are the desert falcon watching from on high, providing justice\u2014true justice\u2014to the people of Taneth. If we dare call ourselves the Iron Wheel, let us turn ever onward until the Bailiffs Guild restores itself!\"\nIn my opinion, a passionate idealist can be far more dangerous to the crown than a hundred Lady Varmonds. It is therefore my recommendation to avoid further investigation into Magnifica Falorah's affairs while the Iron Wheel is in her employ. Though ludicrous to think the crown had any cause to invade her family tomb, Chief Inspector Rhanbiq is like a clothier who plucks at every loose strand before him until he unravels the entire jacket. Best not to dangle any thread."}

I had a natural talent for spell-work, and by the age of thirteen I was already quite advanced in the family tradition of Battlemagic. However, I always had trouble with combat teleportation, and I remember one day I was working on trying to 'port a rat from one desk to another, when I was distracted by an argument between Clivia and &lt;a href=\"Euraxia%20Tharn%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Euraxia&lt;/a&gt;. Euraxia was about six years old at this point, and Clivia was seven and a half, but she already wore that haughty majesty that would serve her so well later in life. They were playing the basic version of my father's boardgame, \u201cImperial War-Chess,\" and Clivia had just moved her &lt;a href=\"Guar%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Guar&lt;/a&gt; Cavalry from &lt;a href=\"Morrowind%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Morrowind&lt;/a&gt; to &lt;a href=\"Nibenay\"&gt;Nibenay&lt;/a&gt; over the &lt;a href=\"Velothi%20Mountains\"&gt;Velothi Mountains&lt;/a&gt; to take Euraxia's &lt;a href=\"Rimmen%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Rimmen&lt;/a&gt; Mercenaries\u2014an illegal move, as the speed of cavalry is halved over difficult terrain. Euraxia protested loudly at this violation of the rules, calling Clivia a big cheater. Clivia just slapped her and told her not to be such a baby. This only made Euraxia madder\u2014she drew herself up to her full height and declared that one day, when she was Queen of Rimmen, Clivia would get hers, and then she knocked Clivia's cavalry piece off the board. In response Clivia simply kicked the board hard from below, sending the game, pieces and all, showering over her younger sister's head. \u201cQueens don't scare me,\" she said coldly. \u201cBecause I'm going to be EMPRESS, and then you'll ALL bow your heads.\"\nShe turned to me, unprovoked, and added, \u201cAnd that goes for you, too, Big Ugly. Learn every spell in the library. Just see what good it does you.\" Then she stood, every lovely hair still in place, turned and marched out of the room. Wailing, Euraxia went after her, begging forgiveness.\nThat was Clivia: ever the regal one, with everyone always falling all over themselves to win the crumbs of her favor. Imperious, beautiful, statuesque even, she had a dazzling smile, but she only bestowed it on one who'd paid for it somehow\u2014or was going to. She had no talent to be a Battlemage, she lacked Euraxia's instinctive grasp of power politics, she never learned Father's trick of demanding a good man's loyalty, and yet she was the one Abnur groomed for the Ruby Throne. Because Clivia had the inborn aura of command: people simply wanted to do her bidding, and when she gave an order, it felt wrong to disobey.\nHow did she do it? I never did figure that out. There was no magic involved, so far as I could tell. It was just her nature. When Prince &lt;a href=\"Emperor%20Leovic\"&gt;Leovic&lt;/a&gt; came back triumphant from his first campaign against the border raiders, our family was there in the Great Hall with the other councilors and great nobles to receive him. His father, Emperor &lt;a href=\"Moricar\"&gt;Moricar&lt;/a&gt;, praised the prince and decreed that he could name his reward. Prince Leovic didn't hesitate: he walked right up to us and said, \u201cYour Majesty, I want the Chancellor's daughter.\" And though Abnur Tharn had many daughters, we knew which one he meant."}

While I understand the threat that the Moon Hunter Pack presents to &lt;a href=\"Tamriel\"&gt;Tamriel&lt;/a&gt;, I also understand that we do not have the resources to take them on alone. We cannot let our pride in the Silver Dawn allow good soldiers to die.\nHowever, knowing you, my pleas will fall on deaf ears. As such, I am sending &lt;a href=\"Commander%20Varian\"&gt;Commander Varian&lt;/a&gt; along with this letter. Even knowing the heavy odds against us, he has agreed to undertake this mission. Varian is a good man, loyal to the &lt;a href=\"Order%20of%20the%20Silver%20Dawn\"&gt;Silver Dawn&lt;/a&gt; and meticulous in his practices. You will find no soldier more worthy or willing to lead a squad into Moon Hunter Keep.\nCommander Varian was stationed in the keep before Vykosa's attack, only missing the massacre by a few days due to another assignment. Honestly, a part of me believes he feels a sense of guilt about the whole affair. I know many of those who died were under his command at the time. I sincerely hope he does not allow this past tragedy cloud his judgment.\nBy the &lt;a href=\"Nine%20Divines\"&gt;Eight&lt;/a&gt;, I wish for nothing more than to strike against &lt;a href=\"Moon%20Hunter%20Keep\"&gt;Moon Hunter Keep&lt;/a&gt; and to end their reign of terror. But I know that, should we go through with this plan of action, we're sending many fine soldiers to their deaths. Including Commander Varian, one of the best men I have ever had the privilege to fight alongside.\nAgain, I urge you to reconsider this plan of action. There must be another way.\n-Captain Murzazir"}

My wanderings took me far beyond the boundaries of civilization, where the fabric of the &lt;a href=\"Mundus\"&gt;Mundus&lt;/a&gt; grows thin indeed. I only recently returned to the land of Summerset.\nI encountered a fellow traveler on my journeys through the veil, Ritemaster\u2014the &lt;a href=\"House%20Telvanni%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Telvanni&lt;/a&gt; sorcerer, &lt;a href=\"Divayth%20Fyr%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Divayth Fyr&lt;/a&gt;.\nI'm sorry to report that his temperament has not improved. When Divayth left our isle of &lt;a href=\"Artaeum%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Artaeum&lt;/a&gt;, he was a sharp-elbowed upstart. In the intervening millennia, his power and vanity have grown a thousand-fold. Thankfully, his ambitions remain very narrow. He does not desire wealth or influence in his Great House Telvanni. He has no interest in accumulating followers or expanding his holdings beyond &lt;a href=\"Tel%20Fyr%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Tel Fyr&lt;/a&gt;. He seeks forbidden knowledge, and little else. This of course poses its own dangers. Forbidden knowledge is forbidden for a reason, after all.\nWe found each other on the Isle of &lt;a href=\"Dranil%20Kir\"&gt;Dranil Kir&lt;/a&gt;. I went to the island to investigate an ancient Psijic scrying device. When I entered the ruins, I found Divayth Fyr engaging in some profane Daedric ritual. I interrupted it, of course\u2014not wanting to be devoured by whatever he intended to pull from the void. He was far from pleased.\nAfter a bout of cursing, he explained his intentions (in the most patronizing terms possible). Apparently, he intended to open a rift to a pocket dimension using a bizarre &lt;a href=\"Dwemer\"&gt;Dwarven&lt;/a&gt; device. I asked him why. He made a sour face and sighed. \u201cWhy do we do anything, my dear Lilatha? To prove that we can, of course.\"\nHe went on to ask me about a &lt;a href=\"Daedric\"&gt;Daedric&lt;/a&gt; artifact he's keen to acquire. Well, not \u201cask,\" exactly. Fyr would never ask for help outright. No, he twisted his words to make it clear he was doing me a favor by bringing me into his confidence. I told him I hadn't heard anything, and urged him to conduct his Daedric experiments elsewhere.\nIn truth, I do know about this artifact, and Divayth is smart enough to know I was lying. I urge you to keep a close eye on him, Ritemaster. Divayth is not nefarious, but his motives remain too murky for my taste. Trifling with Daedric artifacts is a dangerous proposition, even for mages as powerful as Fyr. Perhaps one day he will temper that power with humility. I'm not optimistic.\nYours in magic,\nLilatha"}

The time has come for our scattered clan to reunite, for soon we shall have a home. Your father followed the hag mother's signs. For thirty days and thirty nights I traced a path of crow-pecked carcasses through the highland crags, seeking the story their picked and broken bones would tell. Under the light of the full moons the Hunt-Father revealed to me his blessed beast.\nTwice my height and thrice as broad, this great brute needed no cunning to best any mortal man. His eyes regarded my approach, reflecting their keen edge in the moonlight. His gaze was more curious than wary, and that made for the two of us. The hag mother had crooned of a beast who would impale the twin moons upon its horns, but impressive as this &lt;a href=\"Minotaur%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Minotaur&lt;/a&gt; was, it seemed a feat beyond a creature of flesh and blood. I began to question whether I had I picked the path true, or read the rooks wrongly.\nMy doubts were tossed aside as the beast drew himself to his full height and I glimpsed what the hag mother espied in her fevered dreams: the beast's horns aligned with the twin moons at their zenith in the night sky. It was then I knew I'd found the Hunt-Father's favored. Triumphant, I bared my throat to the sign of the speared moons, threw my arms wide, and howled. The cry was caught short as the great beast seized my throat with his massive hand, but I did not flinch. If the Hunt-Father desired my sacrifice that night, I would have been blessed to meet my end at the hands of his chosen beast.\nWithout effort he tore the talisman I wore from my neck and regarded the ruddy stone carving with recognition.\n\u201cKeptu\" he uttered. Though the word meant nothing to me, the omen was a good one.\nI watched in silence as the beast lowered itself to the cold stone and began a wordless chant that called to the mountain. The stone began to shift, and where once there was only flat rock a basin began to form. He tore his palm on the point his horns and let his blood flow into the shallow bowl, then he bade me do the same. As our blood mingled in the shallow pool, the heat of the wounds grew as pale and dim as the moonlight.\nHe held out the talisman of our ancestors, dwarfed in his massive fist, and squeezed. With a snort and the muffled crunch of stone he scattered its dust across the pool. The echo of crumbling rock returned to us a hundred fold, but it was not carried on the wind. The mountain's reply rumbled from deep within its belly, stirring like a long hibernating beast woken by the cry of its lost cub. The feeling in my bones was the land, our land, calling us home.\nHear me now, as I echo the call of the land, my wayward sons and daughters! Heed me and follow the Horned Lord's favored son to the den of our ancestors! From this day forward we are the Dreadhorn, and our brothers in hoof and horn are one with our clan. From this day forward we will retake all that has been poached from our lands and hunt the Nords who've spent their years siring a soft brood fattened on undeserved spoils. All their weakness will be trampled under the hooves of &lt;a href=\"Domihaus%20the%20Bloody-Horned\"&gt;Domihaus the Bloody-Horned&lt;/a&gt; and our ways will shape these lands once again!\n-Snatched from the crows of Gherig Bullblood, Patriarch of the Dreadhorn Clan"}

Even my most gifted scouts could only keep pace with her for a few minutes at a time before losing her to the shadows. And even in those cases, I suspect she wanted to be seen for some reason\u2014perhaps to lead us away from an ambush, or draw our attention to something noteworthy. I am confident that she means us no harm, and I thank the Three for that. If she did want us gone, I suspect we'd all be dead many times over.\nJudging by her height and complexion, I'd say she's probably &lt;a href=\"Imperials%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Imperial&lt;/a&gt;. But we've never observed her wearing anything other than a weathered &lt;a href=\"Akaviri\"&gt;Akaviri&lt;/a&gt; panoply, so any connection to the &lt;a href=\"Imperial%20Legion%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Legion&lt;/a&gt; seems unlikely. So far as we can tell, she has no companions in the city. We have reason to believe she has made contact with our enemies in the &lt;a href=\"Daggerfall%20Covenant\"&gt;Covenant&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Aldmeri%20Dominion%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Dominion&lt;/a&gt;, but those meetings have been infrequent and cursory. So, in short, we can't say with certainty who she actually works for. Our best guess is some clandestine offshoot of the former &lt;a href=\"Dragonguard\"&gt;Dragonguard&lt;/a&gt;. \nWhat worries me the most is her temperament. There is something about how she carries herself that makes the troops nervous. She often appears agitated\u2014pacing or walking in circles. Other times she will sit, almost catatonic, for an hour or more before giving us the slip. This would be less troubling if she wasn't so \u2026 I guess \u201cmurderous\" is the word? We've found hanged cultists and severed heads in almost every district of the city\u2014left as a warning for &lt;a href=\"Molag%20Bal%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Molag Bal's&lt;/a&gt; troops, and perhaps us as well. \nIn the weeks we've been stalking her, we've only had one actual meeting. One of my junior pathfinders, Elam, bumbled into an old tea-house full of &lt;a href=\"Dremora%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Dremora&lt;/a&gt;. They seemed poised to burn him alive before the Drake arrived. She slew the lot of them in three strokes of her sword. Split one of their heads like melon and cut the other three in half. Elam stammered out a faint \u201cthank you.\" She stood there staring at us for a moment, like she was struck dumb. Eventually she called him an \u201cidiot\" and disappeared out the back door. \nMy counsel is this: give her a wide berth. Accept what aid she offers, but don't get in her way.\nBlood for the &lt;a href=\"Ebonheart%20Pact\"&gt;Pact&lt;/a&gt;,\nLieutenant Drathyn"}

You meant it as an insult and I never gave you a reply in words, so I'll tell it to you now. While there's still time.\nI'd returned home from the victory over the &lt;a href=\"Akaviri\"&gt;Akaviri&lt;/a&gt; snakes a warrior of some renown. I pledged my sword to the &lt;a href=\"Jarl\"&gt;Jarl&lt;/a&gt;, became a man of rank and consequence, and as reward my days were spent pacing the garrison walls. When an escort was needed for the Jarl's wife and young child to join him in &lt;a href=\"Solitude\"&gt;Solitude&lt;/a&gt; for the crowning of High King Svargrim, I leapt at the chance to leave the hold.\nThe journey looked to be every bit as dull a duty, until we left &lt;a href=\"Rorikstead\"&gt;Rorikstead&lt;/a&gt; and the quiet was disturbed by a tremor. Wary, we brought our caravan to a halt and waited for some clearer sign of danger. A fatal mistake. In our hesitation, we'd stopped in the path of a stampeding herd of &lt;a href=\"Mammoth%20%28Online%29\"&gt;mammoths&lt;/a&gt;. They exploded from the treeline and tore through us without effort, upending our carts and trampling warriors underfoot. I managed to toss the Jarl's young daughter, &lt;a href=\"Eerika%20Skjoralmor\"&gt;Eerika&lt;/a&gt;, clear of danger as one injured beast toppled onto us in its death throws, but her mother and I were not so fortunate. I came to, half buried under an avalanche of fur, to the enraged bellowing of a &lt;a href=\"giantess\"&gt;giantess&lt;/a&gt; as she swatted away the last of our escort from her herd. She locked eyes with me trapped under her butchered animal and I knew the end was upon me.\nAs her shadow blotted out the light, I made my peace, not seeing that Eerika had climbed atop the mammoth. I tried to call out, but my warning was drowned out by a howl of anger from that tiny child that stunned even the towering figure before her. Whether it was fear or regret that gave the giantess pause, I cannot say, but she backed down in the face of that fearless whelp. Thanks to Eerika I survived that ill-fated encounter, but her mother was not so fortunate. With my legs crushed, I spent the remainder of our journey in the back of a cart, consoling Eerika as best I knew how, but she didn't need my pity. Her tears were hard as ice. In truth, she weathered the loss better than her father. As the Jarl steadily began to take his council from his cups, it fell on Eerika to carry the burden.\nAt twelve she strode into the dens of &lt;a href=\"Bear%20%28Online%29\"&gt;bears&lt;/a&gt; to fight the famine of an early winter, by sixteen she chased &lt;a href=\"Orsimer%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Orc&lt;/a&gt; raiders from our hold with a handful of loyal blades, by nineteen she'd slaughtered the rampaging &lt;a href=\"Frost%20Troll%20%28Online%29\"&gt;frost troll&lt;/a&gt; Raudhungr and earned her title as &lt;a href=\"Thane%20%28Title%29\"&gt;Thane&lt;/a&gt; by deed, not lineage. There's not a soul in &lt;a href=\"Falkreath\"&gt;Falkreath&lt;/a&gt; that doesn't owe Eerika their thanks and their lives. I am no exception. This hold endures because of the steel in that woman's spirit and we'll need every scrap of it in the days to come.\nThere's thunder rolling over the mountains, but it's not rain that looms in the distance. The horns of the Reach signal the coming flood and again the tremor of misfortune's approach comes too late. This will likely be the last words you hear from me, so take them to heart when I say there's been no greater honor in my life than to serve Eerika Skjoralmor and there will be no more glorious death to ferry me to Sovngarde than any I meet at her side.\nShould we speak again, it'll be her you have to thank.\nYour brother,\nTorik\n&lt;a href=\"Housecarl\"&gt;Housecarl&lt;/a&gt; to Thane Eerika Skjoralmor"}

I joined up with the &lt;a href=\"Bosmer%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Wood Elf&lt;/a&gt; known as &lt;a href=\"Eveli%20Sharp-Arrow\"&gt;Eveli Sharp-Arrow&lt;/a&gt; and even now we travel toward the &lt;a href=\"Orsimer%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Orc&lt;/a&gt; city of &lt;a href=\"Orsinium%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Orsinium&lt;/a&gt;. To the Wood Elf, this one is nothing more than another adventurer seeking fame and fortune in the wilds of &lt;a href=\"Wrothgar%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Wrothgar&lt;/a&gt;. She has no reason to suspect that I am one of the &lt;a href=\"Eyes%20of%20the%20Queen\"&gt;Eyes of the Queen&lt;/a&gt; and a trusted friend of the infamous Razum-Dar. But what you hope I'll discover about this untested novice, I'll never understand.\nLet me be blunt. The Wood Elf is practically a child. As far as I can tell, this is her first trip out of &lt;a href=\"Valenwood%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Valenwood&lt;/a&gt;. She has as much business answering &lt;a href=\"King%20Kurog\"&gt;King Kurog&lt;/a&gt;'s call as a newborn lion has trying to vie for leadership of its pride. This one suspects she won't last an hour once we cross the border into Wrothgar. She'll turn around and run back to Valenwood at the first sign of trouble\u2014or she'll be dead. I don't see any other option.\nEveli Sharp-Arrow reeks of innocence and inexperience. She talks of nothing but going on a grand adventure and becoming a hero. Her na\u00efvet\u00e9 would be cute if she hadn't signed on to help tame one of the wildest and most dangerous regions in all of &lt;a href=\"Tamriel\"&gt;Tamriel&lt;/a&gt;. This one has a mind to just tell her to go home now, before it's too late. But no, I have my orders. I will simply observe and report. But damn you, Razum-Dar! This young woman doesn't deserve to be tested in your fires. I know you expect her to become a weapon, but from what I've seen, she'll crack when her metal is exposed to too much heat!\nThis one hasn't changed his mind about the Wood Elf, but what I saw today has given me much to consider. I suppose this is the kind of news you wanted to hear. We're still about a day from the Wrothgarian border, serving as guards for a caravan full of supplies, artisans, and Orc peasants bound for the city of Orsinium. The trip has been uneventful. Until today. We were set upon by Red Rook Bandits who saw us as easy pickings. Before I could react, Eveli leaped to the top of a wagon and launched arrow after arrow into the surprised marauders. Every one of her arrows hit its mark. Almost as quickly as the attack began it was over, the bandits fleeing as fast as their wounded pride could carry them.\nThe Wood Elf acted bravely, but as soon as the danger passed she turned pale and sat down hard. I think she was actually sickened by putting arrows into live targets! Still, she performed better than I expected. Maybe you're right and there's more to Eveli Sharp-Arrow than I suspect. For now, this one will keep watching\u2014just as the great Razum-Dar has ordered.\n&lt;a href=\"Aroz%27lai\"&gt;Aroz'lai&lt;/a&gt;, the Queen's Eye in Wrothgar"}

My feet have carried me no farther than &lt;a href=\"Lilmoth%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Lilmoth&lt;/a&gt;. I have never tasted the water of the Deepmire, or swum in the eddies of the Ree-An-Wo. What could I possibly have seen that is so unusual?\"\n\"Have you never stepped inside Lilmoth\u2019s old-time house?\" I said. She had, of course. Everyone knows this place and its great piles of old, useless things. \u201cHave you not met the soft-skin who lives there?\u201d\n\"&lt;a href=\"Famia%20Mercius\"&gt;Famia&lt;/a&gt;?\" she snorted\u2014as if the very idea was a &lt;a href=\"wasp\"&gt;wasp&lt;/a&gt; in her nose. \"But she is just a smiling, crazy person.\"\nI shook my head. \"Not crazy, little-heart, but strange all the same. You ask why she is the oddest creature of all? Consider the turtle.\n\"The turtle walks slowly and wears armor on her back. Her soul is cautious, just as her body is cautious. The hoop viper sleeps in the tree, striking when it suits him. His soul is fickle and slippery, just like his body. Every bird, beast, and person in Murkmire acts according to their nature\u2014except for Famia.\"\nThe hatchling\u2019s questioning-spine quivered and she leaned forward, sniffing out the truth in my words. \"But many soft-skins come to our lands looking for old statues and useless treasures. She collects broken pottery and dusty jewelry, just as they do.\"\n\"True,\" I replied. \"But you must consider why. Many soft-skins come to rob us of our land, our secrets, and even our lives. Others come to 'educate' us\u2014convinced, as they are, that we are fish-brained savages in need of their pity and guidance. To both the robber and the missionary, we are inferior. Our goods and traditions are novelties. Not so, for Famia.\"\nI lifted the hatchling onto my lap and placed a hand over her left eye. \"Famia sees with a chameleon\u2019s eyes, little-heart. One gazes down the dry-path. It seeks musty ruins, and old &lt;a href=\"xanmeer\"&gt;xanmeer&lt;/a&gt; vaults. Always examining, preserving, and cataloguing. Never seeing.\"\nThe hatchling giggled and squirmed in my lap as I uncovered her left eye and pressed my palm over her right. \"The other eye stares ever downriver. It sees the truth of our people. It looks upon our works, and songs, and traditions as glorious and beautiful. It yearns to know the will of the Hist, as we do.\"\n\"And despite all this,\" I said, as I placed her back at my feet. \"Despite her forked soul and unbalanced eyes, Famia lives joyfully. She dances on life\u2019s shore with one foot in the water and the other in the sand. A child of neither, and a child of both.\"\nI looked into the little hatchling\u2019s eyes, and I saw the first flickers of understanding. \"So, do you see how strange she is now?\"\nHer lips curled into a &lt;a href=\"Saxhleel\"&gt;Saxhleel&lt;/a&gt; smile, and she nodded. \"I do, deelith. Perhaps strangeness is not so bad.\""}

I have always valued your counsel, such as it is, when it comes to the matters of state, but this business with &lt;a href=\"Father%20Egnatius\"&gt;Father Egnatius&lt;/a&gt; cannot be allowed to continue. I have spent years preparing for the arrival of our dark patron, &lt;a href=\"Molag%20Bal%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Molag Bal&lt;/a&gt;. My &lt;a href=\"Order%20of%20the%20Black%20Worm%20%28Online%29\"&gt;worms&lt;/a&gt; have woven plots of intrigue that would make even &lt;a href=\"Mephala%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Mephala&lt;/a&gt; blush. And yet, this simple priest continues to walk the halls of power, unmolested. This is wholly unacceptable.\nIt troubles me that you do not see the risk that a man like Egnatius poses. I grant you that he is not a member of the &lt;a href=\"Elder%20Council\"&gt;Elder Council&lt;/a&gt;, but his shadow looms over every proceeding. Just yesterday I saw him breaking bread with Falco and that paunchy fool, Gulsanius. Egnatius was urging them to reconsider the Memorial construction project\u2014a project that is vital to our interests.\nIf he were just a common priest, I would have no cause for concern. I have shaken the faith of prophets and driven saints to suicide. &lt;a href=\"Alessia\"&gt;Alessia&lt;/a&gt;'s sheep are easily shorn. Easily slaughtered. But not this Egnatius. No, not Egnatius, with his books and his scrolls and his warm-hearted smiles. He is too well read. He strikes me as a scholar first and a priest second. There is no zealotry left in him\u2014no secret malice for me to twist and shape. It is maddening. I tell you, Tharn, there are few things I hate more than an educated holy-man.\nYou have cautioned me against spilling his blood before. I know he is well-loved, and his death would be an unwelcome distraction. But faith is unpredictable. In the hands of a learned man, it can spell doom for plots both great and small. I will not allow our great undertaking to die at the hands of a frumpy, balding friar. Remove him from play or I will flay him alive.\n\u2013 &lt;a href=\"Mannimarco%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Mannimarco&lt;/a&gt;"}

Life as &lt;a href=\"King%20Kurog\"&gt;King Kurog&lt;/a&gt;'s forge-wife isn't awful, but I long to smell the fires of &lt;a href=\"The%20Morkul%20Forge\"&gt;Morkul&lt;/a&gt; and feel the heat of the blazing forges on my face. Does that make me an ungrateful wife for the king? I promise I'll try to do better and not bring disgrace to our clan, but sometimes it's all I can do not to steal a royal mount and ride away from this loud and boisterous &lt;a href=\"Orsinium%20%28Online%29\"&gt;city&lt;/a&gt;!\nWhat am I going on about? Sometimes I think I must sound like one of those spoiled Breton dowry wives, &lt;a href=\"Malacath%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Malacath&lt;/a&gt; forbid! In your last letter, you asked me to tell you all about life in the king's court. You seemed especially interested in &lt;a href=\"Forge-Mother%20Alga\"&gt;Forge-Mother Alga&lt;/a&gt;, so let me start there. The king's mother represents everything I hope to become as Kurog's forge-wife. She's strong-willed yet caring, firm but diplomatic. I've seen her calm a room full of angry clan chiefs with nothing but a reasoned argument and a couple of pointed revelations designed to subtly break the tension. She really is amazing!\nAlga epitomizes the concept of the elder &lt;a href=\"Orsimer%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Orc&lt;/a&gt; matron. She's positively ancient! But age hasn't slowed her down as far as I can tell. She gets around better than I do with that staff of hers. She never goes anywhere without it. She's strong, sharp-witted, and she might be the smartest Orc I've ever spoken to. She seems to know something about everything and everyone, and she's wise and kind\u2014especially to me and the rest of Kurog's wives. She treats us like the daughters she never had.\nWhenever Kurog travels, Forge-Mother Alga remains behind to run the kingdom. Oh, she's delegated certain responsibilities to me and the other wives, but make no mistake\u2014the forge-mother's in charge. Practically every Orc female in &lt;a href=\"Wrothgar%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Wrothgar&lt;/a&gt; owes her a favor, and I've seen her use these connections to get the chieftains to act as she wants them to. She makes it all look so easy, but I know the amount of work she puts in to maintain these important connections.\nWhat else can I say about Forge-Mother Alga? She's a devout Orc, devoted to that newfangled god that everyone in Orsinium is wild about. Trinimac. He's much too weak for my taste, not a proper god like Malacath at all, but you won't catch me saying that when the forge-mother is around. She even brought in a high priestess, a city Orc named &lt;a href=\"Solgra\"&gt;Solgra&lt;/a&gt;, to oversee the temple and lead the prayers to &lt;a href=\"Trinimac\"&gt;Trinimac&lt;/a&gt;. Her religious views aside, I really do admire the forge-mother and what she stands for. She's helping Kurog fulfill his dream of a united Orc nation, and I'm doing my part to follow her example. She's an inspiration!\nI'll write again soon,\nYour daughter, &lt;a href=\"Tugha\"&gt;Tugha&lt;/a&gt;"}

Accept her as the true and solitary leader of all she surveys. In return, she promises to allow you to retain some semblance of rulership over &lt;a href=\"Kvatch%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Kvatch&lt;/a&gt; and your uncle's original holdings, provided you declare your faithfulness and undivided loyalty to the Her Excellence's banner. It is, after all, the right thing to do.\nNeed I remind you that, unlike yourself, Fortunata was not born to nobility. Everything she has attained she earned through blood and sweat and deception. You must admit, she really is a remarkable woman! It didn't take her long to rise to the top of the &lt;a href=\"Gold%20Coast%20Trading%20Company%20%28Faction%29\"&gt;Gold Coast Trading Company&lt;/a&gt;, securing a place on the ruling council of the shipping magnates and filling the company's coffers with unprecedented amounts of gold. She had a dream and an ambition that went beyond mere business, however. In short order, she used her connections and considerable charms to rally the Red Sails pirates to her side, amassing an armada of merchant vessels and pirate ships united under her white flag emblazoned with a blood-red saber. That was when she earned the title of Pirate Queen.\nThanks to your uncle's ill-timed revolution, Anvil was left nearly defenseless and ripe for conquest\u2014and that's exactly what Fortunata did. She sailed her armada into port, squelched a few half-hearted attempts to repel her approach, and took &lt;a href=\"Anvil%20Castle%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Anvil Castle&lt;/a&gt; as her own. The city leaders saw the value in accepting Fortunata's leadership and quickly set out to garner Her Excellence's favor. That was when she took the title of Provincial Governor.\nNow, Her Eminence knows all about your objections to the fact that she has annexed the entire Gold Coast and placed everything southwest of &lt;a href=\"Varen%27s%20Wall%20%28Location%29\"&gt;Varen's Wall&lt;/a&gt; under her protection. She has done this because she cares and because she has the means and resources to fulfill her promise to the people of the Gold Coast. Why can't you just accept her generosity and stop this continuous bickering? Don't we have real problems to deal with here? The &lt;a href=\"Dark%20Brotherhood%20%28Online%20Faction%29\"&gt;Dark Brotherhood&lt;/a&gt;, for example, operates openly throughout our region, flouting our power and threatening everything we all hold dear. I wouldn't be surprised if they're responsible for the recent murders that have plagued both our cities. You can't deal with them. &lt;a href=\"Primate%20Artorius\"&gt;Primate Artorius&lt;/a&gt; and his Cathedral can't stop them. Submit to Fortunata's rule and let her do what she does best.\nIn the end, do you really think you have any other choice?\nIn Governor Fortunata's name, I remain,\nBraccus Klinicus, Master Scribe of Anvil Castle"}

I am quite certain that events in the area have begun to conspire against the &lt;a href=\"Dark%20Brotherhood%20%28Online%20Faction%29\"&gt;Dark Brotherhood&lt;/a&gt;, just as you predicted. As such, I have started to take a closer look at the Brothers and Sisters operating out of the Gold Coast Sanctuary. Of the various assassins available to us, of particular interest to me is our Brother, &lt;a href=\"Green-Venom-Tongue\"&gt;Green-Venom-Tongue&lt;/a&gt;.\nGreen-Venom-Tongue, an &lt;a href=\"Argonians%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Argonian&lt;/a&gt; from &lt;a href=\"Black%20Marsh%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Black Marsh&lt;/a&gt;, has served the &lt;a href=\"Night%20Mother\"&gt;Night Mother&lt;/a&gt; and our &lt;a href=\"Sithis\"&gt;Dread Father&lt;/a&gt; practically since he emerged from his egg. As a ruthless and accomplished killer, Brother Venom takes on many of the choice assignments from the Sanctuary's &lt;a href=\"Astara%20Caerellius\"&gt;matron&lt;/a&gt; and the resident keeper of contracts. I have even utilized his services a number of times for clients who performed the Black Sacrament. His technique and use of the Blade of Woe does the Brotherhood proud. I have no doubt that he will play an important role as events related to &lt;a href=\"Anvil%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Anvil&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Kvatch%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Kvatch&lt;/a&gt; unfold.\nAll that being said, Green-Venom-Tongue elicits a number of concerns that you need to be aware of so that anything that occurs later doesn't surprise you. The Gold Coast Sanctuary was not Brother Venom's first home within the Brotherhood. We both know what happened and how Brother Venom was exonerated, but a few doubts and questions still linger regarding that time. He also owes as much allegiance to us as he does to Black Marsh and he often returns there to fulfill his duties as a &lt;a href=\"Shadowscale\"&gt;Shadowscale&lt;/a&gt;. This is as it should be, though it means that Brother Venom may not be available to us when we want to utilize his talents. Beyond that, Brother Venom has a few peculiarities that mark him as strange among his more grounded Brethren.\nFirst, Brother Venom remains distant and cut off from the rest of his Brethren. While I am sure this relates to events surrounding his former Sanctuary, it nevertheless serves to make his Brothers and Sisters uncomfortable in his presence. Second, he has an overly curious mind. In fact, I would go so far as to say that his persistent attention and endless stream of questions come off as quite unsettling. He makes his fellow assassins nervous. Third, he carries one or more journals with him wherever he goes, and he constantly jots down notes and makes meticulous records of everything that he observes. He never allows anyone to see what he's written, and he guards his journals with an almost jealous zeal. I would venture to guess that Green-Venom-Tongue isn't completely sane. Then again, who among the Brotherhood truly is?\nDespite his distinctive oddities, Green-Venom-Tongue represents an important asset in the Dark Brotherhood's arsenal of weapons. As sharp as the keenest blade and as dangerous as a sudden storm, Brother Venom has risen to the top of my short list of assassins that will help shape and ensure the future of the Gold Coast Sanctuary. I am heading to the area now to supervise events personally\u2014and to check on a potential recruit who may be able to help us as well.\nYours in the Night Mother's cold embrace,\n&lt;a href=\"Speaker%20Terenus%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Speaker Terenus&lt;/a&gt;"}

You write with the same wit and charm you always have and whilst reading your letter, I found myself blushing despite myself. But that is neither here nor there. You did not write me solely to make me squirm in my seat. You need aid, and I happen to have just the man for the job.\nHis name is &lt;a href=\"Jakarn\"&gt;Jakarn&lt;/a&gt;. He's a &lt;a href=\"Bretons%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Breton&lt;/a&gt;, resourceful, talented with a blade, and not too hard on the eyes either. But let me be clear: the man is a scoundrel. Though I know you've always held a fondness for scoundrels, a woman as intelligent and competent as you is better suited not employing them. I can honestly say that if it were not for the specifics of the job that needs doing, he would be the last man I'd suggest to you.\nWhy, you may ask? Plainly put, he is a thief who fancies himself an irresistible romantic. In my experience, that combination is usually the most insufferable. Though Jakarn certainly has enough admirers following him around at every port to follow through with such claims, it does not make his bravado any more palatable. I say this because he has won such admirers through over-bloated stories of his heroism and upbringing. He's fashioned so many tales about himself that it's rather hard to tell where they end and the real man behind the farce begins. I'm not entirely clear on what it is he does. Smuggling, piracy, general thievery\u2014it seems he\u2019s dabbled in it all.\nHe spent some time in &lt;a href=\"Stros%20M%27Kai%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Stros M'Kai&lt;/a&gt; (in a prison cell, I heard) and afterward became part of a privateer's crew. &lt;a href=\"Captain%20Kaleen\"&gt;Captain Kaleen&lt;/a&gt;'s crew, to be exact. Though I hear she's reformed these days, I'm sure I don\u2019t need to tell you the kind of unsavory business Jakarn was likely up to while in her employ. I know he spent some time in &lt;a href=\"Elsweyr%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Elsweyr&lt;/a&gt; recently as well, and apparently had some nasty business with stealing a priceless gem (something that seems to be a habit of his, so keep a close eye on your valuables).\nNow, I say all this only to give you a complete picture of the man. To do otherwise would be a disservice to you. That, and within two minutes of speaking with him, you would discover most of these things for yourself anyway and turn him away. So, as much as it pains me to sing Jakarn's praises and risk inflating his ego even further, I want to stress to you why I think he is the perfect man for the job.\nDespite his many, \"many\" flaws, Jakarn is a man who gets things done. His life of distasteful activity has granted him a wealth of contacts, favors, and friends that he may call upon at any moment. Granted, not all of these resources think favorably of him. But that is Jakarn's way. Somehow, despite his nature, he inspires loyalty enough that both his enemies and his friends will heed his call. Perhaps it is merely the unspoken allegiances between scoundrels. Or perhaps Jakarn's charm does him more service than one would think.\nEither way, he is a man who is exceedingly well-connected. He is someone who has operated as a thief long enough to know how to get things passed through hands unseen. He also knows how to operate with discretion and understands the value of gold more than the average man. He also happens to be smart enough to know not to ask too many questions. Though he may be a tad unprincipled for your tastes, I think it is this quality in particular that makes him well suited for the role. You do not need a well-to-do hero for this endeavor. While your mission's goal is heroic, you know as well as I do that the real world sometimes requires us to get our hands dirty. Jakarn is someone who will gladly get his hands dirty in your stead and ensure success. In this matter of yours that determines the fate of the Alliance, and possibly all of &lt;a href=\"Tamriel\"&gt;Tamriel&lt;/a&gt;, I can recommend no one better.\nHe will test your patience, of course, but I know a woman of your caliber can handle him.\nYours truly,\nSabinette Mavine, Ambassador to the Court of &lt;a href=\"Wayrest%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Wayrest&lt;/a&gt;"}

I looked left to see Kuseem drowning in &lt;a href=\"voriplasm\"&gt;voriplasm&lt;/a&gt;. He died well, but could not utter his final death-curse. He just made a gurgling sound, like a &lt;a href=\"Guar%20%28Online%29\"&gt;guar&lt;/a&gt; with its throat cut. His face, once sharp and covered in bright red war-paint, sloughed off his skull like a wet rag. All in one piece. Dissolving in a pool of green slime, right before my eyes.\nOn my right, Tlek fought like a tailless &lt;a href=\"wamasu\"&gt;wamasu&lt;/a&gt;, filled with righteous &lt;a href=\"Naga\"&gt;Naga&lt;/a&gt; fury--desperate to kill what she could before blood-loss and fatigue claimed her life at last.\nSlime-covered ghouls approached from all sides. I crushed and cleaved, just as my root-mother, and her root-mother before her, had done. But my weapon, becoming coated in corrosive slime, sagged and cracked, growing weaker with every strike. Weaker and weaker. Just like Tlek. Just like me.\nAs I prepared to charge headlong into the Dread-Father\u2019s arms one last time, I heard a hiss and a roar behind me. It was &lt;a href=\"Jaxsik-Orrn\"&gt;Jaxsik-Orrn&lt;/a&gt;. In that moment, I knew we would survive.\nShe set upon the voriplasms with such rage and strength that even I, her egg-brother, felt a hatchling\u2019s fear well up in my throat-sac. Grave-stakes that the dead-not-dead wielded like clubs crashed against her armor, shattering in a spray of splinters and blood. Voriplasms lashed at her legs, leaving ragged wounds on her calves and thighs. But no injury, large or small, slowed Jaxsik-Orrn\u2019s assault.\nIn the end, nothing remained of our enemies but broken bones and clumps of slowly fading ooze. Despite her seeping wounds, my sister lurched toward what remained of Kuseem, knife in hand. \u201cFight on, root-brother,\u201d she whispered reverently, before prying what remained of his head from his ragged corpse.\n\u201cStake the rest,\u201d she rasped. Tlek and I did as we were told\u2014pressing Kuseem\u2019s grave-stake deep into his chest and pinning him to the thick mud under the water.\nMy egg-sister lowered her head and pressed her fist to her chest. \u201cGlory in dying,\u201d she hissed.\n\u201cGlory in death,\u201d we replied.\nIn those days, Jaxsik-Orrn was just a hunter like us. But as we stood there, covered in blood, we saw her true heart--the heart of a war-captain. A hero. And one day, a legend."}

While I share your concerns about the hazards of such an expedition, I also can think of no one more suited to uncover the secrets of &lt;a href=\"Zaan%20the%20Scalecaller\"&gt;Zaan the Scalecaller&lt;/a&gt;. Davaux is one of the most resourceful and rational academics we have at our disposal. If anyone can accomplish this task, it is him.\nI also understand your hesitation in the importance of such a short-lived &lt;a href=\"Dragon%20Priests%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Dragon Priest&lt;/a&gt;, a hesitation shared by many academics throughout history. However, Davaux's observations are correct. It is well documented that Zaan's connection to her dragon &lt;a href=\"Thurvokun\"&gt;Thurvokun&lt;/a&gt; was unusually robust, though the nature of this connection has been little speculated upon. To think that this may lead to a better understanding of the connection between Dragon Priests and their &lt;a href=\"Dragons%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Dragon&lt;/a&gt; Lords is an exciting prospect, and well worth the funding that Davaux has requested.\nFor years, Davaux has given his all to this institution, asking little in return. You'll find none more passionate about the mysteries of Dragon Priests, or more hard working to uncover those mysteries. It would be an absolute travesty to deny him funding at this point. Let him go, I say. Let's see what he's truly capable of. I don't believe we'll regret it.\nYours Sincerely,\nProfessor Chamrond\nP.S.\nAs for your inquiry towards the nature of Davaux's markedly &lt;a href=\"Nords%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Nordish&lt;/a&gt; given name, I believe this part of his family's customs. His mother Torrelda, who I had the great pleasure of working alongside several years ago, often spoke of her strong lineage of Nord scholars. I can only speculate that Davaux is named after Jorvuld the Reserved, a commander known for his rational thinking and defensive tactics; traits that did not make him a particularly popular within the Nord community."}

I am not averse to investigating our allies, especially those individuals who report to high-ranking officials, such as the Speaker of the Mane, and have the freedom to move throughout the alliance unhindered.\nInterestingly, I was not able to dig into Khamira\u2019s past much beyond her relatively recent promotion to aide and agent for the Speaker of the Mane. She has no obvious familial connections that I could ascertain, despite her noble bearing. Prior to her appointment, she appeared in Gharesh-ri\u2019s company from time to time, vaguely introduced as his ward and apprentice. It is clear that Gharesh-ri took a personal hand in her training and education, molding her into the role she now fills. By all accounts, she\u2019s incredibly capable and the Speaker has come to depend on her unique skills and abilities.\nAs an aide to the Speaker of the Mane, Khamira serves as a sort of confidential advisor, personal assistant, and secretary for Lord Gharesh-ri. However, Khamira isn\u2019t confined to constantly remaining at the Speaker\u2019s side. She also acts as his agent, traveling throughout &lt;a href=\"Elsweyr%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Elsweyr&lt;/a&gt; and beyond to help conduct the business of the &lt;a href=\"Khajiit%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Khajiit\u2019s&lt;/a&gt; spiritual leader, the Mane. My intelligence indicates that she acts as the Speaker\u2019s voice, delivering messages and decrees with the weight of his authority. She has worked as a diplomat, a courier, and\u2014dare I say it\u2014a spy. Just as we pay attention to happenings that could be of interest to the &lt;a href=\"Queen%20Ayrenn%20%28Online%29\"&gt;queen&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Aldmeri%20Dominion%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Dominion&lt;/a&gt;, it shouldn\u2019t surprise us that the Speaker of the Mane does the same for the Khajiit.\nKhamira is well spoken and highly educated. Her cadence has none of the usual Khajiiti structure or mannerisms, and she rarely if ever employs contractions when she speaks. A love of adventure drives Khamira, and when she isn\u2019t traveling for the Speaker she can be found exploring ancient ruins and other places of historic interest\u2014especially places that have a connection or significance to the Khajiiti people. She has a passion for the history and legends of her people, and should probably be considered an expert in the field despite her lack of credentials as a scholar.\nMy research indicates that she has a fierce and devoted love for her homeland. Elsweyr\u2014particularly &lt;a href=\"Northern%20Elsweyr\"&gt;Northern Elsweyr&lt;/a&gt;, also known as Anequina\u2014seems to be near and dear to her heart, and she carries a sense of responsibility that goes beyond both her position and her relatively young age. She demonstrates a similar respect and admiration for Lord Gharesh-ri, which he reciprocates in kind. He treats her, in some regards, as the daughter he never had, though the role she fills came to her through her own hard work and capabilities. He may have groomed her for the job, but he clearly expects her to excel at it. Despite his fondness for and connection to the young Khajiit, he has no qualms about making her work and requiring her results to be nothing short of perfect.\nOne other thing of note that I mention only because the mystery intrigues me. Khamira wears a pendant of some sort on a chain around her neck. While she rarely displays the jewelry openly, she never seems to go without it. I haven\u2019t been able to get a complete description of the pendant, but it appears to feature the two moons revered by the Khajiit, &lt;a href=\"Jone\"&gt;Jone&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Jode\"&gt;Jode&lt;/a&gt;. This matches her interest in her heritage, but I can\u2019t help wonder if there\u2019s more to this adornment than simple decoration. I will continue to look into this young Khajiit as time and opportunity permit.\nIn the meantime, I think I can say with all confidence that Khamira, as an agent of the Speaker of the Mane, deserves watching. As long as she continues to serve the Khajiiti people, the Mane, and the Dominion, she represents an asset we should encourage and cultivate. If any of those aspects ever change, we should revisit this discussion, for I could see Khamira maturing into either a valued ally or a dangerous enemy if the interests of the Khajiiti people were to hang in the balance.\nAdvisor Penewen"}

Contrary to the state of affairs presented to you by Kurog himself during his last visit to &lt;a href=\"Wayrest%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Wayrest&lt;/a&gt;, the Orcs aren't a united nation and the city is far from complete. Despite Kurog's proclamation of kingship, many of the clans still operate as independent city-states, and some clan chiefs directly oppose Kurog's reign. Regardless, the king continues to promote his agenda of a united &lt;a href=\"Orsimer%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Orsimer&lt;/a&gt; nation and a rebuilt Orc city. If anyone can succeed at these momentous tasks, it is definitely Kurog gro-Orsinium.\nThrough all these difficulties, King Kurog remains an imposing figure. He really is the ultimate warrior-king. He's strong and savage in battle, boisterous and fun-loving in private, and utterly ruthless in politics. He has an amazing appetite for life in general, as well as a singular love of food and drink. In some ways, Kurog reminds me of an exuberant child\u2014full of wide-eyed wonder and a sense of humor that ranges from Orcishly crude to remarkably sophisticated. In many ways, he's a true conundrum: carefree and gleeful one moment, brooding and deadly the next.\nKurog believes that the time has come for the Orsimer to change; change their religion, change their traditions. \u201cOur customs served us well in the past, but now they hold us back,\" the king has said on numerous occasions. \u201cIt makes it very difficult to have a civil discourse about anything of substance if someone, sooner or later, is going to reach for something sharp or heavy to promote his or her own point of view.\"\nIs Kurog a worthy ally? Yes, I believe that he is. Will his program to rebuild the Orc city of Orsinium and unite the Orc clans into a single nation succeed? I hesitate to make predictions, but I can tell you with all sincerity\u2014I believe in King Kurog. I believe that when he brings his intellect and his considerable strength of will to bear, he can succeed at whatever he sets out to accomplish. If nothing else, under Kurog's rule, Wrothgar is in for interesting times. Very interesting, indeed!\n&lt;a href=\"Zephrine%20Frey\"&gt;Zephrine Frey&lt;/a&gt;, Royal Chronicler of Wayrest"}

Narilmor was a devout follower of &lt;a href=\"Meridia\"&gt;Meridia&lt;/a&gt; who dedicated his life and his city to her veneration. At the height of his reign, he was regarded as a favorite of the &lt;a href=\"Daedric%20Prince\"&gt;Daedric Prince&lt;/a&gt;, second only to &lt;a href=\"Umaril%20the%20Unfeathered\"&gt;Umaril the Unfeathered&lt;/a&gt;. There is considerable evidence supporting this claim, but the proof positive was the great beacon that shone above Garlas Malatar fueled by the unquenchable light of Meridia. It was known as the Guiding Light, and while it may have paled in comparison to the magnitude of the &lt;a href=\"White-Gold%20Tower%20%28Online%29\"&gt;White-Gold Tower&lt;/a&gt;, it was an unmistakable landmark visible from great distances. The account of one Ayleid captain claimed he could sail from &lt;a href=\"Yokuda\"&gt;Yokuda&lt;/a&gt; to Garlas Malatar by its light alone.\nUnder King Narilmor's reign, Garlas Malatar prospered as a cosmopolitan port city and trade hub for the Ayleid Empire. Unlike many kingdoms of the era, the \"Cavern of the High Wood\" welcomed its neighbors within its formidable walls, so long as Meridian law was obeyed. To deviate from Narilmor's code of conduct was a high crime and punished harshly, but the king was thought of as a fair ruler who maintained order without favoritism or exception. The most notorious example of Narilmor's strict judgment was the execution of a neighboring ruler who did not show Meridia adequate deference during a diplomatic visit to the city. Despite his hardline approach, Narilmor was beloved by his subjects, who enjoyed wealth and abundance across all strata of their society, and respected by his peers for his honorable agreements and the equitable terms of his treaties. Both would sour on him in the final years of his rule.\nAfter the fall of the White-Gold Tower, which marked the end of the Ayleid Empire, King Narilmor withdrew from the world outside his kingdom and Garlas Malatar closed its gates to all outsiders. While the remaining Ayleid kingdoms brokered alliances and waged wars in the vain hope that the &lt;a href=\"Alessian%20Slave%20Rebellion\"&gt;Alessian rebellion&lt;/a&gt; could be held back, Narilmor only paid lip-service to his former allies and lent neither aid nor asylum in their hour of need. Many an Ayleid army perished cursing his name.\nWhat happened within Garlas Malatar during those troubled times remains a mystery, as the site has remained sealed since the Alessians sacked the city. What little correspondence escaped the walls spoke of growing unrest, and the ruthless quashing of dissent. Some accounts of the siege that lead to the city's downfall claim that Men never set foot inside Garlas Malatar before it collapsed into ruin. If true, it would mean that the city was buried by conflict from within, or a final act of sabotage. Whatever the truth may be, on that day the Guiding Light and the rule of King Narilmor were extinguished, never to be seen again."}

Yes, Dragons! Amazing, isn\u2019t it, that the creatures of legend have turned out to be real. As the Royal Strategist, I had my doubts about what we would find in the &lt;a href=\"Halls%20of%20Colossus\"&gt;Halls of Colossus&lt;/a&gt;. I admit, I refused to believe Queen Euraxia and &lt;a href=\"Zumog%20Phoom%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Zumog Phoom&lt;/a&gt; when they insisted that their research indicated what the ancient ruins contained. Once the Dragons emerged, however, I made it my goal to study the magnificent creatures and advise Her Majesty on how best to negotiate with them.\nWhich brings me to the very nature of these great beasts. I must record my thoughts about &lt;a href=\"Mulaamnir%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Mulaamnir&lt;/a&gt;, the powerful Dragon who has mostly interacted with Queen Euraxia and me since they arrived in &lt;a href=\"Northern%20Elsweyr\"&gt;Northern Elsweyr&lt;/a&gt;. Mulaamnir is a massive creature, surely among the largest of his kind. He refers to the other Dragons that emerged from the Halls at his side as his \u201cbrothers,\u201d but I have yet to ascertain if this refers to an actual familial connection or to a sense of companionship created after their long association.\nMulaamnir, a massive Dragon adorned in azure scales, answered Queen Euraxia\u2019s summons and spoke in a commanding tone that indicated he represented all of the newly released Dragons. His rumbling voice sent shivers down my spine, I must admit. I find no shame in this admission. Even Her Majesty seemed ill at ease standing before the huge beast. We honestly had no idea if the Dragons would agree to Queen Euraxia\u2019s offer of an alliance or if Mulaamnir would smite us with fire or swallow us whole into his expansive maw. I almost bolted when he referred to us as \u201clittle morsels.\u201d But I held my ground and demonstrated my worth to my queen.\nSince that first meeting, I have had the honor of interacting with Mulaamnir on Her Majesty\u2019s behalf on multiple occasions. By studying the creature and engaging it in conversation, I have learned and surmised a great many facts concerning Mulaamnir and his brethren. As I mentioned above, this particular group of Dragons work much more closely and communally than the legends and ancient documents I reviewed indicated. The existing records suggest that the ancient Dragons that once ravaged the land were solitary creatures that competed as much with themselves as with others. It is clear from our interactions, however, that this band of Dragons has a strong bond and shared purpose, and that Mulaamnir commands his fellows with an authority not unlike that of Queen Euraxia.\nPhysically powerful, I witnessed Mulaamnir accomplish extreme feats of strength with terrifying ease. During an engagement between &lt;a href=\"Euraxian%20Legion\"&gt;Euraxian forces&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Khajiit%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Khajiiti&lt;/a&gt; militia, I watched with a mix of fascination and horror as Mulaamnir landed in the middle of the catfolk army and tore into them with teeth and claws, wings and tail. He obliterated them like a whirling scythe cutting through tall, dry grass. More to the point, I could see that he thoroughly enjoyed the mayhem.\nThe Dragons employ intense &lt;a href=\"Thu%27um\"&gt;breath weapons&lt;/a&gt; of various types. For example, I\u2019ve seen Mulaamnir pour fire from his gullet down upon Khajiiti soldiers and civilians alike. I\u2019ve also seen him employ a type of storm magic in much the same way. As I understand it, it just depends upon the particular shout the Dragon uses to call forth the power. I don\u2019t completely understand how this works, but it seems to be some sort of magic. I take it certain &lt;a href=\"Nords%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Nords&lt;/a&gt; and even some of the past emperors were able to utilize this form of magic, but never to the extent of the Dragons.\nMulaamnir possesses a surprising amount of knowledge, especially concerning Khajiiti lore. Well, maybe not so surprising, given his vast age. Though beastlike in form, Mulaamnir and his kin are closer to us in intellect than might be immediately obvious. Perhaps, I dare say, they are our superiors. He has a keen interest in the moons for some reason, but I can\u2019t get him to elaborate or go into detail. For an ally, he keeps his own counsel and isn\u2019t as forthcoming as either I or Queen Euraxia would like. It frustrates her, I know, but I haven\u2019t been able to get the Dragon to open up more than he already has.\nMulaamnir and his Dragons have been instrumental in our first victories against the Khajiiti rebels who refuse to accept the rule of Queen Euraxia. I just wish I could convince Mulaamnir to lend us more than a single creature at a time. With the combined might of all the Dragons, we could retake control of the entire region in a day! Of course, they seem incapable of or unwilling to discern a difference between our troops and the enemy. They take no care to avoid friendly casualties and seem to revel in destruction, no matter the target. Our control of these creatures is haphazard at best. We see the Dragons as weapons, but until we can fully control them, they remain as much a danger as a boon. We must find a way to get Mulaamnir and his Dragons to obey the chain of command!\nToday\u2019s conversation with Mulaamnir was unsettling. I have grown used to being referred to as a morsel, but the Dragon let slip a significant fact that we were previously unaware of. We were wrong. Mulaamnir isn\u2019t the lead Dragon.

She actually ordered me to put my request in writing! When did the business of murder become so regulated, that's what I want to know! I digress. The reason for this letter\u2014I'd like to work with &lt;a href=\"Naryu%20Virian%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Naryu Virian&lt;/a&gt; now that she's returned to &lt;a href=\"Vvardenfell%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Vvardenfell&lt;/a&gt;.\nWhy, you're probably wondering, would an assassin of my rank, standing, and experience within the &lt;a href=\"Morag%20Tong%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Morag Tong&lt;/a&gt; want to share a writ or two with a relatively new operative who's been busy gallivanting far from the seat of our power in Vvardenfell? Well, that's just it. Naryu has seen the world, from &lt;a href=\"Deshaan%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Deshaan&lt;/a&gt; to &lt;a href=\"Eastmarch%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Eastmarch&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Mournhold%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Mournhold&lt;/a&gt; to the &lt;a href=\"Gold%20Coast%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Gold Coast&lt;/a&gt;, she's racked up more seals on her travel documents than most of the Morag Tong in recent years. Our status and reputation have improved, as you well know, but we're far from the heights of influence we once commanded. Look at Naryu's perspective and experiences abroad. I want to take advantage of the knowledge she's gained to make me better at my job. Just don't tell her I said that. She thinks that offering compliments is a sign of weakness, and I learned long ago never to show that woman any indication of vulnerability.\nI'm not one to tell you what you already know, but the reports I've been privy to concerning Naryu's activities read like the adventures of Investigator Vale! Stopping a plague, saving a king, catching a relentless murderer\u2014all the while completing each and every writ and contract assigned to her. That's impressive! Add to that her sardonic wit, her I-don't-give-a-fetch attitude, and the fact that she makes even Morag Tong leathers look good, and is it any wonder they call her \u201cthe Beautiful Darkness?\"\nDid you know I helped train Naryu, back in the day? It was a toss-up as to whether or not &lt;a href=\"Varon%20Davel\"&gt;Varon Davel&lt;/a&gt; or I were going to get to mentor her through the final stages of her apprenticeship, but I decided to let Varon have all the fun. I suppose I'm regretting that decision now, so I want to make up for it by getting to work with Naryu. To see her in action. I know this might be a lot to ask for, but when was the last time I requested a favor from our esteemed Grandmaster? True, it was a week ago last &lt;a href=\"Morndas\"&gt;Morndas&lt;/a&gt;, but what about the time before that? I don't make it a habit is what I'm trying to get across here.\nWhat can we expect of Naryu Virian now that she's back in Vvardenfell? From all indications, only the best. She's a warrior without equal, capable of cleaving her way through an army of cultists or nonchalantly slipping a dagger between the ribs of a single target with relative ease. She knows more ways to disable or kill a person than even I do, and that's saying something. Poison, garrote, knife, arrow, sword, polearm, stew pot, bed sheet, hairpin, even a copy of Lord Vivec's Twenty-Fourth Sermon\u2014she can turn even the most inoffensive bauble into a deadly weapon. I can't wait to see how she handles a writ that targets &lt;a href=\"House%20Redoran%20%28Online%29\"&gt;House Redoran&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"House%20Hlaalu%20%28Online%29\"&gt;House Hlaalu&lt;/a&gt;! I expect it to be an eye-opening experience, to say the least.\nNow, I heard that she's decided to take on an apprentice of her own now that she's back in the bosom of the Morag Tong. Don't let that influence your decision regarding my request. I won't interfere with her teaching duties. If I can't kill it, eat it, or bed it, what do I care? Let her play at being a teacher. But when a particularly intriguing writ comes along, one that requires more than a single assassin to complete, I want to work with Naryu to get the job done. Grant me this minor boon and I promise not to ask for another privilege for at least a month. No, make that two! I just want to bask in the action and adventure that seems to spin around Naryu the way &lt;a href=\"Baar%20Dau%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Baar Dau&lt;/a&gt; hangs above &lt;a href=\"Vivec%20City%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Vivec City&lt;/a&gt;. And, if we can stay close to &lt;a href=\"Balmora%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Balmora&lt;/a&gt;, so much the better. The Randy Netch Inn serves a scuttle-encrusted fungal eel every &lt;a href=\"Fredas\"&gt;Fredas&lt;/a&gt; that's just to die for!\nWith utmost respect,\n&lt;a href=\"Ashur%20of%20the%20Quiet%20Blade\"&gt;Ashur of the Quiet Blade&lt;/a&gt;"}

Of all the bountiful and numerous boons Akatosh bestows upon us, none gives us more pride and good cheer than the Primate of our Great Cathedral, the pious and righteous &lt;a href=\"Artorius%20Ponticus\"&gt;Artorius Ponticus&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe devotion and piety demonstrated by Primate Artorius on any given day barely hints at his humble beginnings. As the fourth son of the wealthy Ancrus family, young Artorius grew up without a clear idea of his place in the world. Service to the Divines was a natural path for Artorius to follow, but he had little interest in a life of spiritual devotion and prayer. Instead, young Artorius found himself drawn to the notorious crime boss, Vodunius Monrius. It wasn't long before he was running messages and performing errands for Vodunius and his lieutenants.\nPrimate Artorius never hides from his past. He tells us that he was full of \u201cvinegar and fury\" in those days, trying to find his place in the world. He was on the verge of either discovering his passion or losing his way when Akatosh intervened. Four members of the City Guard caught him collecting gold from a shop owner\u2014the daily fee charged to protect the merchant from Vodunius's wrath. Instead of tossing Artorius in a dungeon and throwing away the key, however, the Guard sent him to spend a year and a day with the priests of the &lt;a href=\"Nine%20Divines\"&gt;Divines&lt;/a&gt; as penance for his crimes.\nTemple life soon became too exhausting for Artorius to maintain his rage. Study, meditation, and prayer were juxtaposed by various chores to maintain the temple and its shrines. Despite every attempt to do otherwise, the young initiate soon became fascinated with the tales and tenets of the Divines. He questioned the priests of each shrine endlessly about the Divine honored there, until Artorius eventually found his fate and pledged his service to the Dragon God of Time.\nOf course, you've all heard the story of the \"Miracle of the First Shrine,\" when Akatosh first used Artorius to reveal his will to the faithful. After that fateful event, Artorius received a post here at our Cathedral in &lt;a href=\"Kvatch%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Kvatch&lt;/a&gt;, where he quickly rose through the ranks and eventually took his place as our beloved Primate. Under his guidance and care, the Cathedral of Akatosh has remained a stabilizing force in our part of the world for most of the last decade. And, as we contemplate our blessings on this Mid-Year Celebration, remember that everything that's good and worthwhile in Kvatch and the Gold Coast comes from Akatosh and his chosen representative, Primate Artorius.\nDo not let the pirates of &lt;a href=\"Anvil%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Anvil&lt;/a&gt; disturb your tranquility. Do not fear the shadows or the cowardly assassins that hide within them. For Akatosh is the light and the power, and Primate Artorius is his good right hand.\nAs Akatosh wills it, so shall it be.\n&lt;a href=\"Grand%20Sermonizer%20Fithia\"&gt;Grand Sermonizer Fithia&lt;/a&gt;"}

Locked away in this cell like a broken &lt;a href=\"Fabricant%20%28Online%29\"&gt;fabricant&lt;/a&gt;? Two words: &lt;a href=\"Proctor%20Luciana%20Pullo\"&gt;Proctor Luciana&lt;/a&gt;.\nShe was an obvious mark: a &lt;a href=\"Clockwork%20Apostle\"&gt;Clockwork Apostle&lt;/a&gt; with a whole office and tick-tocks to spare! I refused the job at first. Too dangerous. But the truth is I'm a thrill-seeker at heart. Sometimes it's a virtue. Sometimes it's a vice. This time it was the latter.\nThe first rule of thieving is to do your research! I spent months in the Archivox, sifting through old records, trying to find out who the Proctor was and where she came from. Lean offerings, let me tell you. I did learn a bit about her life in Tamriel. She was an Imperial &lt;a href=\"Battlemage\"&gt;Battlemage&lt;/a&gt;\u2014one of &lt;a href=\"Reman%20Cyrodiil\"&gt;Reman Cyrodiil&lt;/a&gt;'s lieutenants. The histories say she burned a whole regiment of snake-men to cinders at the siege of Pale Pass. It earned her the &lt;a href=\"Tsaesci\"&gt;Tsaesci&lt;/a&gt; title, \u201cXhiado Kas.\" The Flame Maiden. And that's just the start of it!\nAccording to some old &lt;a href=\"Factotum%20%28Online%29\"&gt;factotum&lt;/a&gt; logs, she washed up on the city's \u201cshores\" millennia ago. She was dead when she arrived\u2014had to be. I've seen the surgical charts. Her body was torn to ribbons! &lt;a href=\"Sotha%20Sil%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Sotha Sil&lt;/a&gt; put her back together again, but left most of her limbs on the operating table. She's a machine now, you understand? She never breathes, or eats, or tires. She just walks the halls and alleys of the city, looking for opportunities to bring down her hammer. I only tell you this so you understand why I didn't stand and fight.\nIt all happened on a cool night in the &lt;a href=\"Brass%20Fortress\"&gt;Brass Fortress&lt;/a&gt;, just after the celestiodrome went dark. After a perilous climb up the side of the &lt;a href=\"Clockwork%20Basilica\"&gt;Clockwork Basilica&lt;/a&gt;, my mates and I stole into the Proctor's room through the ductworks. Dodging Factotum patrols, snatching up nosy &lt;a href=\"skeevaton\"&gt;skeevaton&lt;/a&gt;s \u2026 everything was going to plan. She was out on patrol, you see? Wouldn't be back for hours. We were in the clear\u2014or so we thought, anyway.\nWe tossed the place, prying open mnemo-crates and wall alcoves as fast as we could. At last, we found it: one of the Proctor's custom animo cores. Her battery, see? It was a thing of beauty\u2014wrought in heavy brass, covered in copper filigrees, and filled to the brim with geodic energy. We grinned like overstuffed &lt;a href=\"Kagouti%20%28Online%29\"&gt;kagoutis&lt;/a&gt; and turned to leave. That's when we saw her.\nShe was standing there in the doorway, clad in her gleaming brass armor; hammer resting heavy on her shoulder. I put my cognitive compressors into overdrive, trying to assemble a credible excuse for being elbow-deep in her property. Just as I opened my mouth to speak, Murbal reached for his dagger.\nIt all happened so fast. I remember a burst of white-hot light, then Murbal screaming. I looked over at Anton just in time to see his leg crushed by a hammer-blow. I fell to my knees and threw my arms up over my head, waiting for the cold embrace of &lt;a href=\"Oblivion%20%28Realm%29\"&gt;oblivion&lt;/a&gt;\u2014but it never came. Instead, I felt Luciana's cold metal fingers around my throat as she lifted me to my feet. I opened my eyes to see her glaring at me.\n\u201cSeems you and I have a lot to talk about,\" she said. Then she tossed me in here with you lot.\nI'm bound for a few years in storage, I know it. But you still have a chance! Keep your gears clean and your chains taut, lads, because she's always watching. Always."}

Or should I say Provost? Let me be the first to congratulate you on your upcoming promotion!\nVaruni Arvel: Thank you! I do have a bit more to do though. Another lecture in the Loqutorium, one cycle in the devotional laboratory, and this evaluation!\nAlienist Aralosea: Indeed. No one could accuse you of idleness, that much is certain. Now, to business. Please understand that this is a simple formality. You've proven your dedication to the Clockwork God many times over at this point. But rules are rules, am I right?\nVaruni Arvel: That sounds suspiciously like the first question in this evaluation.\nAlienist Arolosea: [laughter] &lt;a href=\"Proctor%20Luciana%20Pullo\"&gt;Luciana&lt;/a&gt; said you were clever. Yes, that is the first question. What are your feelings on rules and regulations?\nVaruni Arvel: Well, that's the central paradox of our order, right? Regulations, scholarly dictates, rigid schematics\u2014they form the foundation of the Apostleship. But then, the Tourbillon's sermons tell us to smash the old machines\u2014to reject all laws and restrictions so that our engines can be made clean. So our spirits can grow.\nAlienist Arolosea: [inaudible] \u2026 seems you favor regulations over disorder.\nVaruni Arvel: How is that?\nAlienist Arolosea: Your record contains zero citations. No disciplinary notices. No sequential admonitions. Nothing.\nVaruni Arvel: With respect, I think that indicates extreme diligence, not a lack of ambition. I've pushed back against scholarly restrictions on several occasions. Just a few cycles ago I conducted a pressure test in the Machine District, despite the travel restrictions.\nAlienist Arolosea: But you notified the Proctor before leaving, isn't that correct?\nVaruni Arvel: Only to prevent a panic. Luciana is a friend. I would have conducted the test regardless.\nAlienist Arolosea: I see. If you don't mind my saying so, I detect some sensitivity on this subject. Does the implication that you favor caution over discovery bother you?\nVaruni Arvel: [inaudible]\nAlienist Arolosea: Come again?\nVaruni Arvel: I think it's a misreading of the facts. I've advanced through the ranks faster than anyone in the history of the city. I've published sixteen dissertations, discovered four heretofore unknown &lt;a href=\"aurbic\"&gt;aurbic&lt;/a&gt; elements, conducted twelve separate Radial surveys \u2026. You can't accomplish all that without taking risks.\nAlienist Arolosea: Then how do you explain this spotless record? Previous provosts received hundreds of disciplinary citations on their path to power.\nVaruni Arvel: I guess I'm just better with people.\nAlienist Arolosea: By that you mean \u2026?\nVaruni Arvel: I try to keep my fellow apostles informed. I value their input. I listen to their advice. Honestly, I think we could all do a much better job of listening to each other. That's something I'd like to change once I receive my promotion.\nAlienist Arolosea: Fair enough. It says here that\u2014\n[Vox transcript corruption: 12 minutes, 34 seconds lost]\nAlienist Arolosea: --see you're very diligent about attending prayer services.\nVaruni Arvel: I'm very committed to the faith, yes.\nAlienist Arolosea: Care to expand on that?\nVaruni Arvel: Lord Seht is my hero. I try to model my life on his example. Attending prayer service brings me closer to him. Helps me focus.\nAlienist Arolosea: Interesting. What aspect of Lord &lt;a href=\"Seht\"&gt;Seht&lt;/a&gt;'s character do you most admire?\nVaruni Arvel: [laughter] Where to begin? I admire his wisdom, his architectural prowess, his mastery of virtuous maths \u2026. I could go on, I guess?\nAlienist Arolosea: That won't be necessary. Now, what aspects of his character do you most detest?\nVaruni Arvel: [long pause] Excuse me?\nAlienist Arolosea: What aspects of his character do you find most repellent? What elements of Lord Seht's personality make you uncomfortable?\nVaruni Arvel: I don't \u2026 [inaudible]\nAlienist Arolosea: Does this question make you uncomfortable?\nVaruni Arvel: Yes, of course it does.\nAlienist Arolosea: Just a moment ago you said you were comfortable with pushing back against regulations and taboos. Should I adjust my notes on that point?\nVaruni Arvel: No \u2026 no, it's fine. I \u2026 [long pause]\nAlienist Arolosea: Take your time.\nVaruni Arvel: I guess it bothers me that he's never around.\nAlienist Arolosea: Go on.\nVaruni Arvel: I \u2026 I mean, I've been a member of the &lt;a href=\"clockwork%20apostles\"&gt;clockwork apostles&lt;/a&gt; for over a century, and I've still never had an opportunity to meet him.\nAlienist Arolosea: And that bothers you.\nVaruni Arvel: I didn't \u2026 I mean, yes, a little. But I would never cite that as a failing on his part. If anything it's my fault for being impatient. He no doubt has important things to do in the &lt;a href=\"Cogitum%20Centralis\"&gt;Cogitum Centralis&lt;/a&gt;. He'll emerge eventually--when he's ready.\nAlienist Arolosea: Very well. It appears that our time is up. Thank you for indulging me. We're done!\nVaruni Arvel: Good \u2026. Good.\n[end transcript]"}

When I was a little girl, you were someone I looked up to and admired. As my older cousin, you taught me so much and inspired me to not only seek perfection, but to do so in the most creative and enlightened manner as possible. When I returned from my travels, you were one of the first of Summerset's nobles to support me and accept my ascension to the throne. You are regal, beautiful, and cultured in ways I can never match. Is it any wonder I made you my surrogate?\nI put a lot upon your fair shoulders, dear Alwinarwe. You must stand in for me at every governmental meeting, ceremony, and public event. And the balls and dinner parties, it must be terribly bothersome to have to smile and wave all the time! Frankly, that's the part of my royal duty that I find most tedious. But where I am hard-pressed to hide my true feelings in such matters, you are the consummate professional, capable of pretending you care even in the most excruciating circumstances. I admire that. I really do.\nI have heard it said that you are old-fashioned and set in your ways. That is true, to an extent, but not so much that you are close-minded when it comes to our people and the betterment of Summerset. When I asked you to serve as my regent and take on the mantle of Proxy Queen while I dealt with important matters in other parts of our kingdom, you agreed without hesitation. I know how much work is involved, but you handle your duties with grace and style and hardly a complaint. I couldn't ask for a better representative. Which brings me to the primary purpose of this letter.\nI can imagine your stern expression as you read these words. I'm certain you're saying to yourself, \u201cWhat does &lt;a href=\"Queen%20Ayrenn%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Ayrenn&lt;/a&gt; want from me now? She always says such nice things right before she asks for the impossible.\" Oh, cousin, how well you know me!\nAlwinarwe, my dearest cousin, I am about to issue a royal decree that directly concerns Summerset Isle. As we have discussed on many occasions, I have finally decided to act upon my inclinations and open our fair and wondrous island to traders, immigrants, and visitors of all descriptions. A copy of the decree is on its way to you in a separate package. I understand that this decision goes against the counsel you have provided me with in the past and probably bends your Altmeri sensibilities nearly to the breaking point, but I need you to stand fast and make sure my wishes are followed to the letter. The Dominion and our place in Tamriel depend on Summerset becoming a free and open land. I know that you will support my wishes and serve me as always in this important endeavor.\nI am sending one of my agents, the Eye of the Queen known as &lt;a href=\"Razum-dar%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Razum-dar&lt;/a&gt;, to assist you and act as my eyes and ears among the people. Try not to let past grievances color your perspective. Razum-dar, well, that's just his way. He rarely means anything by it. And he really is good at what he does. Make use of him as you see fit.\nSo, Alwinarwe, please continue to keep my throne warm and my people safe. Welcome the newcomers with open arms and a friendly smile. We shall all be better because of it.\nWith all my love, dearest cousin, I remain,\nAyrenn"}

I must assume your lack of response to my previous letters is a delay in the packet ships. Piracy in the &lt;a href=\"Abecean%20Sea%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Abecean&lt;/a&gt; is rife this time of year.\nWe at Lillandril Illumination Academy have always been quite clear on our criteria for Quen's matriculation. It pains me to speak so plainly, but you have reneged on your pecuniary commitment to our institution.\nTherefore, I am presented with an unwelcome duty. It is our decision to suspend Quen from Lillandril Illumination Academy, effective immediately.\nWe did not arrive at this decision lightly. There were a number of contributing factors:\nShould you once more see fit to deliver the works of art you had previously guaranteed, we can discuss Quen's potential return. However, an additional three months of silence will convert Quen's suspension to a permanent expulsion.\nOn a personal note, I urge you to speak directly with Quen about her future. Though her time at the academy is most likely at a close, she is still a capable young &lt;a href=\"Altmer%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Altmer&lt;/a&gt; with a future only somewhat diminished. Perhaps she can find a career in our proud &lt;a href=\"Aldmeri%20Dominion%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Dominion&lt;/a&gt; forces, where she can learn to appreciate the simplicity of following orders. A tradesman's work might suit her unremarkable lineage, such as a warehouse worker or seamstress. Whatever her decision, you should be a part of it. Without guidance she may do something rash, such as join a circus.\nKindest Regards,\nTundellde"}

The suffix has a number of meanings in the Khajiit tongue, including \u201cclever,\" \u201ccapable,\" and \u201cthief.\" I have yet to decide which description best fits this arrogant and swaggering \u201cRaz.\"\nFor some reason I plan to uncover, the Kinlord seems uncomfortable with the newcomer's presence, even somewhat fearful. On the surface, I saw little reason for this attitude, but once I began to dig, certain truths began to emerge. Razum-dar claims to be a humble traveler. Or a merchant's agent scouting new trade opportunities. Or a courier from &lt;a href=\"Auridon\"&gt;Auridon&lt;/a&gt;. Or any of another half-dozen different stories he tells when asked about his background and business in Summerset. He arrived in &lt;a href=\"Shimmerene%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Shimmerene&lt;/a&gt; by ship from Auridon and took up residence in the Anchors Aweigh inn. He spends his days wandering the city and talking to everyone and anyone he can get to stand still long enough to interrogate. And make no mistake, he is interrogating them. He just does it in such a way that the average person never notices. From what I was able to observe, I suspect this Razum-dar could talk the wings off a &lt;a href=\"gryphon\"&gt;gryphon&lt;/a&gt;! If only more of my bailiffs had such skill.\nThe Khajiit appears unassuming and self-effacing during one encounter with a city guard, then brash and cocksure a moment later while dealing with a merchant hoping to take advantage of an unsophisticated newcomer. To be fair, I was impressed at how he turned the merchant's aggressive sales pitch into a deal that allowed him to acquire the goods he desired at a substantial discount. He disappears into crowds with practiced ease, which I learned the hard way as I followed him toward the monastery before he slipped away. I've tracked hardened criminals more easily than I was able to shadow this puzzling Razum-dar.\nSilence and stealth are only two of this enigmatic Khajiit's surprising talents. When he wants to make his presence known, he can command an audience with humor and a smile. I watched with growing unease as a crowd of thugs surrounded him on the docks, quite certain I would have to reveal myself and intervene on Razum-dar's behalf. But before things turned ugly and violent, Raz was joking with the crowd and turning their anger into a fond interaction that had everyone laughing. It was a brilliant performance on the Khajiit's part and it impressed me more than I care to admit.\nSo what do all these seemingly contradictory talents tell us about the inscrutable Razum-dar? I have two theories, both of which on the surface seem totally outlandish, but allow me to press on. The first concerns something I know quite a bit about\u2014illegal activities. I suspect that Razum-dar might be a criminal mastermind from the mainland who is using the &lt;a href=\"Queen%20Ayrenn%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Queen's&lt;/a&gt; decree to expand his operation into Summerset. If this turns out to be the case, even the Divine Prosecution would be hard pressed to rein in this elusive crime lord. The second seems equally bizarre as I write these words. Perhaps Razum-dar is one of the fabled warrior guards of the Mane, the leader of &lt;a href=\"Elsweyr%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Elsweyr&lt;/a&gt;. Why a servant of the Mane would travel to Summerset and keep his identity a secret has me stymied, but the various skills displayed by the Khajiit make this theory mostly sound. Why either of these revelations would overly distress the Kinlord, however, I have no idea.\nOne final theory has just occurred to me. It struck me when one of my bailiffs brought me documents that identified a Khajiit matching Razum-dar's description who had visited Summerset in the past\u2014before the Queen's recent decree. This particular Khajiit was spotted in and around the Royal Palace in Alinor during Queen Ayrenn's last visit to the island, sometimes even at the Queen's side. If that was indeed this Razum-dar, then perhaps he's one of Her Majesty's legendary Eyes of the Queen. In that case, that would make Razum-dar a spy of extreme talent and cunning. If that is the cause of the Kinlord's distress, then perhaps my next investigation should concern him and not this complicated and mysterious newcomer."}

I counted four tribes in all, come to comingle and participate in whatever heathen ceremonies they engage in to bring good fortune to their clans. I was able to identify the &lt;a href=\"Ahemmusa%20Tribe%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Ahemmusa&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Erabenimsun%20Tribe%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Erabenimsun&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Urshilaku%20Tribe%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Urshilaku&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Zainab%20Tribe%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Zainab&lt;/a&gt; tribes, including their &lt;a href=\"ashkhan\"&gt;ashkhan&lt;/a&gt;s (chiefs) and &lt;a href=\"wise%20women\"&gt;wise women&lt;/a&gt; (seers). One savage in particular stood out during my investigation, a member of the Urshilaku tribe named &lt;a href=\"Seryn%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Seryn&lt;/a&gt;.\nSeryn holds no official title that I could discern, but she commanded the respect of her tribe as well as that of the other three tribes in attendance. She moves freely from camp to camp, apparently serving as a kind of ambassador for the ashkhan of her tribe. She carries herself with a serene dignity and quiet confidence that puts those she communes with at ease. I was only able to get close enough to listen in on a few of her conversations, but what I heard demonstrated a gift for oration that would make even the Warrior-Poet proud\u2014no blasphemy intended! Her manner and tone clearly indicated that she cared about each person she spent time with, even as she weaved into her narrative probing questions and subtle suggestions that obviously promoted the strategies and policies of her tribal leader without the perception of directives from on high. In my opinion, from what I observed, her diplomatic skills match the best &lt;a href=\"House%20Hlaalu%20%28Online%29\"&gt;House Hlaalu&lt;/a&gt; has to offer.\nMy observations indicate some sort of familial connection between Seryn and her ashkhan. If I had to hazard a guess, I would say they are either siblings or close cousins. &lt;a href=\"Ashkhan%20Chodala\"&gt;Ashkhan Chodala&lt;/a&gt;, a relatively young and extremely robust leader for his tribe, works with Seryn to improve the Ashlander way of life and to negotiate deeper connections among the tribes. This may bear further investigation, as a united Ashlander nation could pose a significant threat to the &lt;a href=\"Great%20Houses\"&gt;Great Houses&lt;/a&gt;, especially &lt;a href=\"House%20Redoran%20%28Online%29\"&gt;House Redoran&lt;/a&gt; and its continuing efforts to expand its influence into that region. Otherwise, Seryn and Chodala demonstrate a deep affection and enduring respect for each other. Deferential to Chodala's rank and standing, she nevertheless acts as her own person, coming across as wise for her age and extremely well spoken.\nWhile Seryn speaks softly, she also carries a hefty staff. I've seen her use it to break up arguments among the savages, defend herself against hostile exiles, and even utilize it to redirect the attention of a charging &lt;a href=\"Nix-Ox%20%28Online%29\"&gt;nix-ox&lt;/a&gt; before it could barrel over a group of Ashlander children. Some diplomats are all talk and little action, but Seryn demonstrated a surprisingly effective knack for both during my observations of the gathering tribes. I recommend that we continue to keep track of Seryn and Chodala. I believe that both will play a vital role in the next stage of Ashlander-Great House relations\u2014no matter what form that stage happens to take. I look forward to the next task that you and &lt;a href=\"Vivec%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Lord Vivec&lt;/a&gt; set before me. For the Three!"}

I do hope you haven't grown too lonely during your well-deserved retirement. Despite your many protestations regarding gifts, I have enclosed a small packet imported directly from &lt;a href=\"Valenwood%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Valenwood&lt;/a&gt;. I have no idea what \"&lt;a href=\"strangler\"&gt;strangler&lt;/a&gt; seeds\" are, but it seemed exotic enough for your garden. Sadly, the instructions must be in error, for it seems you must \"bloodlet thrice daily\" so the plant \"positively associates your scent.\" I must admit, &lt;a href=\"Bosmer%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Bosmer&lt;/a&gt; metaphors are quite beyond me.\nIf you haven't left your garden recently, I assure you that life in &lt;a href=\"Abah%27s%20Landing\"&gt;Abah's Landing&lt;/a&gt; continues apace. The &lt;a href=\"Iron%20Wheel\"&gt;Iron Wheel&lt;/a&gt; no longer marches through the streets, for the merchant lords insisted they decamp from the city. Rumors say &lt;a href=\"Hubalajad%20Palace\"&gt;Hubalajad Palace&lt;/a&gt; was recently occupied by a wealthy new tenant. (Next month's rumors will assuredly speak of a destitute would-be merchant lord evicted from Hubalajad Palace.) Oh, did you hear of the new pirate Commodore demanding tribute from her captains? Should you plan to travel, I would suggest overland routes until she is fully appeased.\nThough I know you are far too polite to ask, and I am of course exceptionally embarrassed to inform you, I do not write you entirely to exchange pleasantries. In all honesty I have grave concerns regarding my business.\nAs you well know, Spotless Goods Shipping Concern has always been the metaphorical feather in my proverbial cap. It is true that I wear no cap due to my naturally flowing mane, and also that I am particularly allergic to feathers, but my point stands. I took Spotless Goods from a back-alley merchant stall to the harbor-side warehouse it is today. I made friends of my rivals, for I never aspired to be the best merchant in Abah's Landing\u2014I simply wish to earn my place at the table. As you know, I have always dutifully paid the right people, whether merchant lord or your former shadowy associates.\nStill, the shadows have been exceptionally quiet since the Iron Wheel's arrival. Even the merchant lords whisper of invaders from &lt;a href=\"Taneth\"&gt;Taneth&lt;/a&gt;. I fear some delicate balance has been upset in the city I love. Remove too many spokes from the wagon wheel, and you break the wagon.\nIt is probably nothing. How did you put it once? That I have a tendency to \u201cstep on my own tail and claim it was a mammoth?\"\nYet I see my heretofore most trusted overseers whispering in the warehouse shadows when they think me departed. I notice my invitations to social occasions have sharply declined, as though my fellow merchants seek to distance themselves. From what? I cannot predict. Since your retirement, I cannot trade favors for word from the shadows\u2014and with the Iron Wheel's recent activities, I do not care to provoke their interest. My situation is most worrisome.\nThis is why it pains me so to remind you of the favor you owe me. A pain worse than freshly plucked whiskers, I pledge to you! If I did not hold the future of Spotless Goods in such high esteem as our friendship, I would never be so crude as to mention it.\nBut should I find a &lt;a href=\"Mammoth%20%28Online%29\"&gt;mammoth&lt;/a&gt; standing upon my tail, I fear you are the only person in Abah's Landing who could help me pry it off.\nWarmest regards,\n\u2014Silver-Claw"}

He was a tall, lanky, somewhat gaunt man, dressed in a most outlandish manner. You see, he wore a cook pot upon his head as though it were a helmet! This one approached him cautiously, but he appeared lost in thought, captivated by the flowing river. When he finally noticed me, he said, \u201cOh, hello. I was just contemplating all the fish in your river. They\u2019re alive, you know. Most disconcerting!\u201d That\u2019s when he introduced himself as \u201cSir Cadwell of Codswallop, gallant knight, righter of wrongs, and defender of the defenseless!\u201d\nRazala examined this Cadwell more closely, noticing his archaic attire interspersed with kitchen implements and utensils that seemed to serve as armor of a sort. His whole appearance was off kilter and out of place. Including the small &lt;a href=\"bantam%20guar\"&gt;bantam guar&lt;/a&gt; that never left his side. He referred to it as &lt;a href=\"Honor\"&gt;Honor&lt;/a&gt;, his faithful steed. This one could not imagine the tiny creature carrying this peculiar fellow anywhere, let alone into battle. Cadwell was thin, but not that thin!\nRazala assumed that this was an elaborate hoax or a trap of some kind set up by the &lt;a href=\"Euraxian%20Legion\"&gt;Euraxians&lt;/a&gt; when Cadwell started to sing the strangest song. \u201c&lt;a href=\"Coldharbour\"&gt;Coldharbour&lt;/a&gt;, Coldharbour, how I miss your desolate shores. Coldharbour, my arbour, I dance amid your molds and spores!\u201d It went on for a number of verses, exalting the virtues of the Daedric realm of despair. This one asked him if he were insane and his answer was quite unsettling. \u201cNo, not to my knowledge. Last time I checked, I was right here. Can\u2019t you see me? Did I disappear again? That happens from time to time. What was the question again?\u201d\nRazala had had enough of obfuscation and the changing of subjects by this point in our conversation. This one demanded to know who Cadwell was and what business he had in &lt;a href=\"Northern%20Elsweyr\"&gt;Northern Elsweyr&lt;/a&gt;. He, in turn, wanted to know how I could stand \u201cliving among all these lush grasslands and vibrant colors. I find it quite off-putting, but to each his own, I suppose.\u201d The man made this one want to drive her own claws into her forehead to make him stop! Razala restrained this impulse, however.\nAnd then, like the sun emerging from behind a thick cloud, the infuriating Cadwell finally began to make sense. Mostly. He told Razala the following story:\n\u201cI was a gallant knight, a hero of old and a champion of chivalry \u2026 or, at least I remember being something or another along those lines. It was a very long time ago. For the last few aeons or so, I\u2019ve been a &lt;a href=\"Soul%20Shriven\"&gt;Soul Shriven&lt;/a&gt; in Coldharbour. Actually, I\u2019m probably the oldest Soul Shriven in Coldharbour. I\u2019m certainly the most sane. The rest of the poor wretches, they do look up to me. A sort of role model, you understand.\u201d\nThis one had no idea what Cadwell was talking about. What was a Soul Shriven? This one had no clue. So Razala got more insistent with her questions. \u201cTell Razala what a monster from Coldharbour wants in our land,\u201d this one demanded. \u201cDon\u2019t we have enough problems, what with the Euraxians and now the &lt;a href=\"Dragons%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Dragons&lt;/a&gt;?\u201d\n\u201cCan anyone truly have enough problems?\u201d Cadwell asked innocently. \u201cI have no idea what a Euraxian might be. And as for Dragons \u2026 no, no, I\u2019ve got nothing. Haven\u2019t seen one of those lovely creatures in, well, a Dragon\u2019s age. Used to be a lot more of them flying overhead, as I recall. Good times.\u201d\nThe pot-wearing fool was about to depart, just like that, when Razala unleashed her most penetrating growl. You know the one, brother. You\u2019ve been on the receiving end more than once since Mother brought you home from the healer\u2019s pavilion. Cadwell stopped, turned, and gave me an expression that said, \u201cWas there something else?\u201d This one almost screamed in frustration! \u201cWhat. Is. Your. Purpose. Here?\u201d Razala made sure to say each word slowly and with the appropriate amount of menace. So as to make this Soul Shriven fool understand Razala was serious, yes?\n\u201cMy purpose?\u201d Cadwell asked with a series of confused blinks. \u201cHadn\u2019t we already talked about that? Or was that the next time we met? Portal travel can be very disorienting. Oh very well, let me explain.\u201d\nThen Razala waited as Cadwell adjusted the pot upon his head, brushed off his tunic, and stamped the mud from his boots. He began to speak. Then stopped. Reconsidered. Then started again. \u201cWhat was the question?\u201d\nRazala blinked at Cadwell incredulously.\n\u201cOh, I remember!\u201d Cadwell exclaimed. \u201cMy purpose. It isn\u2019t anything nefarious, I assure you. You see, I had a dream. A vision. A dream-vision. Perhaps a vision-dream. It led me to this land of sand and sun and &lt;a href=\"Khajiit%20%28Online%29\"&gt;cat people&lt;/a&gt;. I adore you cat people, by the way! I have come in search of \u2026. Well, I\u2019m not quite sure. But I\u2019ll definitely know it when I see it!\u201d\nWith that, Cadwell waved his hand and a portal opened right in front of him. An actual hole in the air! His bantam guar, Honor, charged into the glowing portal. Then Cadwell followed, joyfully yelling, \u201cTally-ho!\u201d With that, the portal winked out of existence and they were both gone, as if they had never been there.\nNo, brother, Razala wasn\u2019t drinking plum brandy or sweet wine. Not any more than usual, anyway. If you notice a tall, thin man wearing a cooking pot on his head, do not approach him. Do not talk to him. And by the Moons above, do not let him talk to you! Razala thinks his particular brand of insanity might be catching, yes?\nYour sister, Razala"}

Your list of potential hirelings, while impeccably written, suffers from one glaring omission: the lizard slave, &lt;a href=\"Sun-in-Shadow%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Sun-in-Shadow&lt;/a&gt;.\nThese other mages bore me. According to my spies, Saduro does nothing but tinker away in Magister Otheri's laboratory, like some blight-faced, maladjusted &lt;a href=\"Dwemer\"&gt;Dwarf&lt;/a&gt;. And Teris Saryon? Two-hundred years old and still suckling at her uncle Gothren's teat. Pathetic.\nThis Sun-in-Shadow, though; she intrigues me. What a novelty! An &lt;a href=\"Argonians%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Argonian&lt;/a&gt; who can weave spells as well as she pushes a broom? It's just beyond belief. And self-taught, as well? My contacts inside &lt;a href=\"Tel%20Naga%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Tel Naga&lt;/a&gt; tell me that she reads &lt;a href=\"Nomu\"&gt;Nomu&lt;/a&gt;'s Tome of Unchained Arcana when no one is looking. The Unchained Arcana! I dare say that you still struggle with Nomu's work, Eraven. Honestly, the fact that she can read at all boggles the mind.\nHer talent is raw, undoubtedly. Like most novices, she breaks more things than she mends. Otheri tells me that she nearly burned down Tel Naga, casting spells of conflagration to warm soup in the scullery. She also played a role in that unfortunate &lt;a href=\"Nix-Ox%20%28Online%29\"&gt;nix-ox&lt;/a&gt; transmutation a few weeks back. But any true mage can see that these blunders are the result of audacity. Ambition. A &lt;a href=\"House%20Telvanni%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Telvanni&lt;/a&gt; mage needs both in ample measure. I have no patience for the meek. Cowardly mages are like capless mushrooms\u2014unsightly and worthless.\nI doubt we have much to worry about when it comes to mixed loyalties. Rumor has it that she is widely disliked by the other slaves. They call her \u201cLukiul,\" \u201csmoke-scale,\" and \u201cElf-heart.\" Reinforce this sentiment whenever possible. She must feel isolated. Isolation breeds contempt, and contempt drives excellence. She needs a heart of cold obsidian if she's to be of any use to us.\nNow, there is the issue of her racial handicap. You needn't remind me of her limitations. I've known ten generations of Argonians, and even the brightest were little better than well-trained guars. With time and effort, though, she might ascend to retainer. Perhaps even oathman if she fully commits to the craft. Who knows? I'm anxious to find out how far this lizard is willing to go.\nKeep an eye on her. She has the magical aptitude, certainly. Whether she has the stomach for Telvanni politics, well, that remains to be seen.\n&lt;a href=\"Magister%20Therana%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Magister Therana&lt;/a&gt;\nWizard-Lord of the Great House Telvanni\nMaster of &lt;a href=\"Tel%20Branora%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Tel Branora&lt;/a&gt;"}

I\u2019ve known scholars who are less well-versed after decades at the &lt;a href=\"College%20of%20Sapiarchs%20%28Online%29\"&gt;College of Sapiarchs&lt;/a&gt;, let alone self-taught! It\u2019s just a pity she\u2019s so \u2026 territorial. Oh, well, I don\u2019t wish to speak ill of a professional rival. It\u2019s just that competition for unspoiled ruins can be fierce! Especially with her. And I\u2019m not one for making unfounded claims, but I suspect she stole my notes on the &lt;a href=\"Dwemer\"&gt;Dwemer&lt;/a&gt; of eastern &lt;a href=\"Skyrim\"&gt;Skyrim&lt;/a&gt;.\n-&lt;a href=\"Neramo\"&gt;Neramo&lt;/a&gt;\nWho? I don\u2019t know any Tharayyas. What, &lt;a href=\"Stibbons\"&gt;Stibbons&lt;/a&gt;? Can\u2019t you see I\u2019m\u2014you know her? She offered you a bribe? Stibbons! Since when do you fraternize with disreputable women behind my back? I met her? Well, a lady of my standing can\u2019t be expected to keep track of all the would-be dabblers following in my footsteps. I\u2019ve said all there is to say on the matter.\n-&lt;a href=\"Lady%20Clarisse%20Laurent\"&gt;Lady Clarisse Laurent&lt;/a&gt;\nWe\u2019ve actually encountered Tharayya on several occasions. &lt;a href=\"Bangkorai\"&gt;Bangkorai&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Northern%20Elsweyr\"&gt;Anequina&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Vvardenfell%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Vvardenfell&lt;/a&gt;. She has this uncanny knack for appearing when we\u2019re hot on the trail of a new discovery. Quite persistent. She\u2019s made several attempts to lure me from the service of my lady, but no amount of reward or praise could make me abandon Lady Laurent. Ah, it\u2019s nearly tea time! Excuse me, my lady will be quite cross if I\u2019m late with her afternoon libation.\n-Stibbons\nVexing woman. We met over drinks in &lt;a href=\"Whiterun\"&gt;Whiterun&lt;/a&gt; of all places. I took a shine to Tharayya at first, good listeners are hard to find, and she couldn\u2019t get enough of the details of my latest adventure. I was going to invite her along on my expedition, but it wasn\u2019t until after I\u2019d paid her tab that she decided to speak up about her marital commitments. That was the last I saw of her, though I am certain she\u2019s the one who shoved me into a crevasse on my way to &lt;a href=\"Saarthal\"&gt;Saarthal&lt;/a&gt;. She\u2019s widowed now, I hear, which someone should look into. Don\u2019t quote me on any of that.\n-&lt;a href=\"Narsis%20Dren\"&gt;Narsis Dren&lt;/a&gt;\nI like her. No nonsense. Tharayya reminds me of me, if I cared about any of the stuff we\u2019re hunting. Or maybe my brother, if he had any common sense. Raynor and I were going to sign on with her for an expedition to find the lost Vault of Mhuvnak. If it were anyone else, I\u2019d say they were chasing fairy tales, but Tharayya\u2019s nothing if not practical. When she\u2019s on to something, it\u2019s because she\u2019s got proof. That fell through though. Personality conflict. Raynor gets too handsy--with the Dwarven stuff. I was tempted to go this one on my own, but I can\u2019t leave my brother to his own devices for long without serious risk of becoming an only child.\n-&lt;a href=\"Kireth%20Vanos\"&gt;Kireth Vanos&lt;/a&gt;\nShe hit me!\n-&lt;a href=\"Raynor%20Vanos\"&gt;Raynor Vanos&lt;/a&gt;"}

How\u2019s business in &lt;a href=\"Hammerfell%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Hammerfell&lt;/a&gt;? Booming, I\u2019m certain. Those &lt;a href=\"Redguards%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Redguards&lt;/a&gt; drink like fish, and our wine is the best in &lt;a href=\"Tamriel\"&gt;Tamriel&lt;/a&gt;!\nNegotiations here in &lt;a href=\"Murkmire\"&gt;Murkmire&lt;/a&gt; remain fluid. That\u2019s a swamp joke!\nYou\u2019re not going to like this, but I need more gold. Only a few hundred more. We\u2019re very close to making a final deal with these &lt;a href=\"Argonians%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Argonians&lt;/a&gt;\u2014trust me.\nI\u2019ve been negotiating with one of the thick-headed lizard-men since I arrived. He goes by the name of &lt;a href=\"Xukas\"&gt;Xukas&lt;/a&gt;. The locals say he speaks for some tribe or another, but I can\u2019t keep it all straight. Anyway, who cares? You won\u2019t find a less interesting race than the Argonians. All they do is weave baskets, roll around in the mud, and croak at each other.\nXukas must be new to this sort of thing. He asks questions constantly! \u201cHow many people work for you?\u201d \u201cHow much gold do you have in savings?\u201d \u201cWhat are your shipping schedules?\u201d It got so tiresome that eventually I just let him look at our business ledger\u2014as if he could even read something that complicated. In any event, he asks less questions now. Thank &lt;a href=\"Zenithar\"&gt;Zenithar&lt;/a&gt; for that!\nNow, for all his naivet\u00e9 when it comes to business matters, he does have a fair eye for pottery. I know we agreed to purchase some of the cheaper &lt;a href=\"Lilmoth%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Lilmoth&lt;/a&gt;-made stirrup jars to transport our wine, but Xukas introduced me to another lizard named Geem-something-or-other, who makes an even cheaper jar that\u2019s just as good. Needless to say, I jumped at the offer and purchased twelve dozen.\nHere\u2019s where things get complicated. The pottery that Geem-whatever-his-name-is makes contains trace amounts of washtongue powder\u2014a local mineral that helps in the firing process. It\u2019s harmless for Argonians, but causes all sorts of intestinal issues for civilized people like us. Luckily, Xukas knew yet another Argonian named Neef, or Neep, or something, who makes a really remarkable ash-glaze. Applying it to Geem\u2019s pottery should make it perfectly safe for transporting our wine! I bought as much as I could, but supplies are extremely limited.\nXukas explained that Neep\u2019s ash glaze comes from a very specific marsh plant that only grows on a peninsula north of &lt;a href=\"Alten%20Meerhleel%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Alten Meerhleel&lt;/a&gt;. He told me the property-owners would probably be willing to trade it to us for next to nothing\u2014they\u2019d just want some old &lt;a href=\"Imperials%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Imperial&lt;/a&gt; deeds, or a favor of some variety. We\u2019d have to sign a contract, I think. I still don\u2019t fully grasp all the particulars. Anyway, once we own the deed to the peninsula, we can make as much of the glaze as we want!\nIn summary, I\u2019ve negotiated circles around this Xukas character, and acquired an entire jar-making operation! Now, as I mentioned, I\u2019ll need something like six hundred gold, a number of old Imperial documents, and some burly laborers to clear brush and beasts from our new land parcel. Make sure they wear sturdy boots. It can get a little wet out there!\nHere\u2019s to a new and lucrative business venture!\nYour cousin and partner,\nLeonian\nLeonian,\nYou want a king\u2019s ransom in gold for defective pottery, insufficient glaze, and a half-sunken peninsula in a man-eating swamp. Xukas is not the one getting fleeced. Come home immediately. And leave the jars.\nCrassus"}

No two the same. A band of misfits if ever there was one, but united by a common desire to overcome new challenges and distinguish ourselves from the pack. A pack that is always growing. We are no longer a loose association of peers, but a continent-spanning guild and the true challenge we face as a collective is meeting the ever-growing demands of our members. Our numbers have feasted glory to the bone, and soon there will not even be marrow left to sate us.\nNew depths must be plumbed and wildernesses explored for the succor of triumph. The unknown must be conquered so that new perils for the Undaunted to overcome can be found. You may think there is no glory in foraging for this bounty, but to ignore our need is to risk growing complacent and soft. Without the Undaunted pledge we are nothing but paper tigers, and without a foe there can be no pledge.\nOur expeditions into new territories are too slow. Too laborious. Too safe. What is needed to sustain us are Undaunted who do not fear to strike out on their own into the fathomless unknown. We must look within our ranks for those who do not simply crave the glory of battle, but find the journey of discovery its own reward. Trailblazers who are canny enough to lead us to the dens of death without becoming trapped in its jaws. Who among you will risk life and limb so that others might claim the spoils of the Undaunted pledge?\nAt least there's one among you who does not balk at the suggestion. &lt;a href=\"Yisareh\"&gt;Yisareh&lt;/a&gt; stands willing to do what needs to be done, and I can think of no one better to lead this charge. I nominate Yisareh to be the first of our Trailblazers.\nSit down, you louts. Cease your mutterings. The Undaunted have no time for those who are quick to protest and slow to volunteer. Is it her courage you doubt? Because she takes the pledge as readily as any of you. Does the blood staining her hands not carry the same weight because it is not that of her enemies, but her fellows? Many of you owe her thanks for the breath you bellow so carelessly. How short would the stories of your lives be, had she not mended your broken bodies and wrestled your miserable souls from the clutches of the Void? Your victories are her victories.\nIs it Yisareh's youth you take offense to? Do you believe the responsibility too great for a member of her rank? Or do you fear she will keep the best bounty for herself? Is this burden greater than that of her mastery over life and death? There are few who wield such power wisely, yet she has never abused her knowledge for selfish reasons. We could use more Undaunted that thought of more than their own glory and took their obligations to our cause more seriously.\nLong before she became Undaunted, Yisareh knew what it meant to go where others feared to tread and to be unyielding in her pursuits. I'm certain Maj would be happy to attest to how the study of magic and necromancy are viewed in Sentinel, yet here she stands unbowed and undeterred. Her drive to reveal that which is hidden is what we now need. Are there any among you who still claim otherwise?\nGood.\nWe are in accord. Yisareh will lead the way forward for us all.\n-- &lt;a href=\"Glirion%20the%20Redbeard\"&gt;Glirion the Redbeard&lt;/a&gt;, at the formation of the Undaunted Trailblazers"}

I wasn't part of the guild then, but our paths crossed. At first, she thought I begged for food on the streets. I did nothing to convince her otherwise. She always paid extra for information\u2014gave me more coin than others from the Thieves Guild. Sometimes she'd slip me a roll, or a piece of fresh fruit.\nWhen she learned I posed as a beggar, a merchant, and a fire juggler depending on the day of the week, she wasn't angry\u2014she was beside herself with amusement. Zeira was the first person in on a joke only I had known for years. I made a true friend that day, sitting on the roof of &lt;a href=\"Hew%27s%20Mane\"&gt;Hew's Mane&lt;/a&gt; and sharing a bottle of grog pilfered from a fishing boat.\nI remember when she asked me to join the &lt;a href=\"Thieves%20Guild%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Thieves Guild&lt;/a&gt;. I had no interest, for my experience was with the guild Bright Ilmund built. I'd received enough beatings from that bunch to know I should keep away. But when I turned her down, she didn't push, cajole, or otherwise manipulate me into doing what she wanted. I kept waiting for her to do so. I was prepared to vanish, if it came to it.\nIt never did. Zeira was part of a new assortment of thieves brought in by &lt;a href=\"Nicolas\"&gt;Nicolas&lt;/a&gt;. She lived by the rules the guild follows to this day. She showed me the principles by which she stood\u2014the kind those of us raised in the alleys of &lt;a href=\"Abah%27s%20Landing\"&gt;Abah's Landing&lt;/a&gt; can appreciate. She set an example, and I realized it was a good one. I still remember the smile on her face when I told her I'd changed my mind. I'd never seen her beam before.\nNow, I find reasons to stand within earshot. I pretend to inspect my jacket for lint, but steal a glance at her features in my hand mirror. I watch for signs she isn't her old self.\nI was lucky to watch Zeira flourish in the guild. A few years after I joined, Nicolas elevated her to the Thieves Council. &lt;a href=\"Velsa\"&gt;Velsa&lt;/a&gt; couldn't stand her, of course, but I believe she appreciated the verbal sparring partner. Edda warmed to her quickly. Daldur made a point of frowning and scowling, but always weighed her words.\nIt's no wonder Nicolas relied upon her as the years turned. She was the guildmaster's right hand, but she never let it go to her head. I once asked if she ever thought about taking his place. She laughed and said, \"What does running a guild compare to pulling off a heist? I'd rather make us all rich. I'm not the type to stare at papers and plan our next move.\"\nBut now, Nicolas is gone. Edda and Daldur are gone. Velsa wants nothing to do with the Thieves Guild. There is no one but Zeira to plan.\nAll the weight falls on our new guildmaster's shoulders. She must gather the few of us who remain, shelter us from the &lt;a href=\"Iron%20Wheel\"&gt;Iron Wheel&lt;/a&gt;, and find a way to restore our honor, such as it is among thieves. She must learn to run the Thieves Guild with Velsa's pragmatism, Edda's spirit, Daldur's boldness, and Nicolas's calculation. She must do things she previously disdained, if she's to lead the rest of us from this dark and lonely place.\nFor example, if she noticed me acting strangely, she might feel the need to read through my journal.\nIf she did, I'd want to let her know that she doesn't need to bear all the weight alone. That despite the way he carried himself, Nicolas did have people to confide in. I'd hope she realizes those few who remain have survived and stuck together because of her actions. I'd tell her she was among family, and that all she truly needs to do is keep setting an example.\nWhen I was certain she understood\u2014truly understood\u2014I could stop spying upon my friend.\n\u2014&lt;a href=\"Walks-Softly\"&gt;Walks-Softly&lt;/a&gt;"}

While it has long been rumored that Euraxia Tharn employed necromancers among her &lt;a href=\"Nibenese\"&gt;Nibenese&lt;/a&gt; mercenaries, I have finally put a name and other details to the dark mage serving as her court wizard. They call him &lt;a href=\"Zumog%20Phoom%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Zumog Phoom&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Orsimer%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Orc&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Necromancer%20%28Online%29\"&gt;necromancer&lt;/a&gt;, a self-proclaimed \u201clord of the dark arts,\u201d reportedly hails from the northernmost climes of &lt;a href=\"Wrothgar%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Wrothgar&lt;/a&gt;. I have found no direct evidence for this assertion, but the wilds beyond &lt;a href=\"Orsinium%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Orsinium&lt;/a&gt; are unforgiving, and life among the Orc strongholds is bleak, harsh, and brutal. I could see the frozen north giving rise to a vile sorcerer such as Zumog Phoom. He presents a proud and powerful visage, totally loyal to the Usurper Queen yet completely devoted to progressing necromancy in all its forms.\nSome information paints Zumog Phoom as a ranking member of the &lt;a href=\"Order%20of%20the%20Black%20Worm%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Order of the Black Worm&lt;/a&gt; and a former student of &lt;a href=\"Mannimarco%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Mannimarco&lt;/a&gt;, but I cannot corroborate these reports. In any event, he has been at Euraxia\u2019s side since her conquest of &lt;a href=\"Rimmen%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Rimmen&lt;/a&gt;, adding his dark magic to her own skills and abilities. She values his counsel, keeping the necromancer close and making him an integral part of her strategy and planning sessions. For his part, Zumog Phoom takes advantage of the power and prestige afforded him by Rimmen\u2019s unlawful ruler. This, in turn, has brought a small army of lesser necromancers to Zumog Phoom\u2019s side. Like a torch burning in the darkest dungeon, he draws other death-casters to Euraxia\u2019s banner like moths to a flame. They fear their dark lord, but also covet the power and training he offers.\nWorse, while we have faced the occasional &lt;a href=\"Zombie%20%28Online%29\"&gt;zombie&lt;/a&gt; or other &lt;a href=\"Undead%20%28Online%29\"&gt;undead&lt;/a&gt; monstrosity operating as part of Euraxia\u2019s forces, rumors of so-called \u201ccadaver forges\u201d have begun circulating among the &lt;a href=\"Euraxian%20Legion\"&gt;Euraxian troops&lt;/a&gt;. These undead factories have begun churning out &lt;a href=\"Skeletal%20Warrior%20%28Online%29\"&gt;skeletal warriors&lt;/a&gt; and zombie soldiers to bolster Euraxia\u2019s army. One Euraxian mercenary, unaware that I was spying for the Speaker of the Mane, confessed to me that fighting alongside hordes of dead people gave him nightmares that \u201call the wine in Rimmen couldn\u2019t chase away.\u201d We have yet to experience the products of these vile places, but evidence of grave robbing throughout the region has become more prominent, especially around &lt;a href=\"Ashen%20Scar\"&gt;Ashen Scar&lt;/a&gt; and other mass graves from the worst period of the &lt;a href=\"Knahaten%20flu\"&gt;Knahaten flu&lt;/a&gt; outbreak. We must make finding these cadaver forges a priority, along with all of the other priorities currently requiring our attention. Moons, who knew overthrowing an illegal tyrant would be so onerous?\nWhile gathering information in Rimmen, I had the opportunity to listen to a couple of Zumog Phoom\u2019s acolytes discuss their master as they gulped down bottles of Bright Moons sweet wine. It was clear to me from their conversation that they both admire and fear the chief necromancer. They spoke in hushed tones at first, but became louder and more animated as they consumed more and more of the wine. \u201cZumog Phoom\u2019s Orcish visage certainly adds to his persona,\u201d commented the first acolyte. \u201cI love how he wears his death-enhanced powers like a shroud around his shoulders,\u201d agreed the second. The acolytes repeatedly mentioned how they could feel the aura of death whenever they were in their master\u2019s presence. While the sensation obviously disturbed them, they also seemed eager to acquire that level of power for themselves. Near the end of their conversation, the first acolyte (who was quite inebriated by this point) started on about how Zumog Phoom had a plan that went beyond anything Queen Euraxia could imagine. \u201cI can\u2019t wait to start digging up body parts,\u201d he said. \u201cThink how the master will reward me if I bring him \u2026.\u201d Before he could say more, his companion told him to be quiet. \u201cEvery tavern has ears, you know,\u201d she warned, proving she had more tolerance to alcohol than her companion. Pity.\nSpeaker, we must find a means for dealing with Zumog Phoom and his followers before they provide Euraxia with an unlimited supply of soldiers. The Defense Force cannot repel an army that does not tire and can be ceaselessly replenished. Our best chance lies in locating the undead factories and destroying them before they can be turned up to full capacity.\nAnd if we can kill Zumog Phoom, so much the better."}

Entrusting a rogue like him with something of this importance was not your finest moment, but I'm not writing to chastise you\u2014at least without also providing you a helping hand. I know a privateer who is well suited to the task of tracking down Jakarn and ensuring that missive reaches its intended destination: &lt;a href=\"Captain%20Kaleen\"&gt;Captain Kaleen&lt;/a&gt;. Maybe you've heard of her?\nNow, I know it's hypocritical of me to chide you for trusting Jakarn and then proposing you enlist a pirate in his stead, but Kaleen is not your typical mercenary freebooter. Her ship, the \"&lt;a href=\"The%20Spearhead\"&gt;Spearhead&lt;/a&gt;\", is firmly in the service of &lt;a href=\"Sentinel%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Sentinel&lt;/a&gt;, and by extension the &lt;a href=\"Daggerfall%20Covenant\"&gt;Covenant&lt;/a&gt;. I can attest that her decision to fly that flag nearly cost her everything, but she stood firm by the decision as her mutinous crew rattled their sabers and demanded her ship. Kaleen had the mettle and the resourcefulness to keep the \"Spearhead\" firmly in her grasp and round up another crew capable of exposing the treason of &lt;a href=\"Port%20Hunding%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Port Hunding&lt;/a&gt;'s &lt;a href=\"Bhosek%20the%20Bloody\"&gt;headman&lt;/a&gt;. In a hostile anchorage, no less.\nThat new crew also thwarted the &lt;a href=\"Bloodthorn%20Cult\"&gt;Bloodthorn Cult&lt;/a&gt;'s plot to conquer &lt;a href=\"Betnikh\"&gt;Betnikh&lt;/a&gt;, which was instrumental in convincing the &lt;a href=\"Orsimer%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Orcs&lt;/a&gt; who rule that island to join the Daggerfall Covenant. Without their intervention, Betnikh would be the foothold of a hostile force of vile necromancers instead of a fortified harbor for the alliance navy.\nShe even endured torture at the hands of the &lt;a href=\"Children%20of%20Yokuda\"&gt;Children of Yokuda&lt;/a&gt; radicals to uncover their treason and prevent the massacre of &lt;a href=\"Shornhelm%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Shornhelm&lt;/a&gt;'s population. All this to say, without the shadow of a doubt, that you can trust Captain Kaleen with any task of importance to the Covenant.\nI say that Kaleen is uniquely suited to tracking down Jakarn because the two have some history, with him serving as an on-again-off-again member of the \"Spearhead\"'s crew whenever he and Kaleen's motives were sufficiently aligned. She is all too familiar with his tricks, associates, and flights of fancy. If anyone can turn up the trail of your missing courier, it will be her.\nShould you decide to take my advice and wish to employ Captain Kaleen, you will need to extend your offer through me. The good captain is presently helming the flagship of a small privateer fleet in the &lt;a href=\"Abecean%20Sea\"&gt;Abecean Sea&lt;/a&gt;, and her movements are a closely guarded secret of our navy. If this diplomatic work is as important as you say, I believe we can spare her long enough to ensure your correspondence is safely delivered.\nIf the fate of Jakarn is of particular interest to you, which I suspect it is, it would be prudent to specify that stipulation in your proposal. While I did say that Kaleen and Jakarn have a history, I didn't say it was the friendliest one.\nSincerely,\n&lt;a href=\"Fahara%27jad\"&gt;Fahara'jad&lt;/a&gt;, King of Sentinel"}

Without the Empire 's support and a steady supply of new recruits, our current objectives will not be achieved before attrition forces us to fully retreat to the Spire.\nWe must make better use of our current crop of Potentials, both to relieve our overstretched Battlemages and to better prepare the apprentices for their trials. We cannot sustain the usual casualty rates and expect our numbers to hold. Allowing worthy Potentials to gain practical experience outside of the Spire is the only way to improve their odds of survival without compromising the value of fully commissioned &lt;a href=\"Imperials%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Imperial&lt;/a&gt; Battlemages.\nLucilla has been a model apprentice since her conscription at the age of six, half the standard years of those identified with the makings of a Potential. And she was head of her class before she turned seven. Despite numerous provocations by members of her cohort, whose pride could not bear being overshadowed by a child, Lucilla has never once retaliated, and her record remains free of demerits. She has demonstrated a level of discipline most veteran soldiers cannot muster, even from an age when keeping her hand out of the cookie jar would be a high standard to uphold.\nLucilla has earned top marks in each of the schools of &lt;a href=\"magic\"&gt;magic&lt;/a&gt;, magical and martial warfare, and contemporary studies. She took first place for single combat in the Potentials Battle Tourney three years running, won the Spire Council\u2019s Commendation for Spellcraft last year, and earned an Imperial Medal of Valor for defending her classmates from rampaging &lt;a href=\"atronach\"&gt;atronach&lt;/a&gt;s during a botched summoning exercise six years ago. She banished four of them herself. Had we allowed it, she very well could have completed her trial before reaching adulthood.\nLucilla\u2019s admiration for the ideals of the Empire we all hold dear borders on worship, and her commitment to our mission to restore it is unquestionable. Traits that are becoming harder to come by in an age where, for most of our recruits, the Empire exists only in books. Lucilla longs for a return to the glories of the Empire with a passion that might rival some of you on the Council who had actually served while that august institution still existed. My only concern for Lucilla is that her devotion lacks a critical eye, blinding her to the hard choices required to maintain order in such a vast Empire. Ending the Three Banners War will require a great amount of sacrifice and she is not yet prepared for the harsh realities of war.\nI fear we have done her a disservice by keeping her within the Battlespire all these years without opportunities for deployment or advancement. Most of our recruits have plateaued in development before their trials due to our inability to embed them in &lt;a href=\"Imperial%20Legion%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Imperial Legions&lt;/a&gt;, and Lucilla reached the apex of what can be learned within these walls years ahead of them. She is one of the most highly trained Potentials in the history of the Spire, but no amount of preparation can replace real experience. It is time we rectified that.\nShould the Spire Council grant this request, I would ask they assign Lucilla to me during my next deployment. It is of a sensitive nature and her fierce loyalty should be an asset in maintaining secrecy.\nHumbly,\nBattlemage Martus Tullius"}

The economic implications of this newly discovered &lt;a href=\"Oblivion%20%28Realm%29\"&gt;Oblivion&lt;/a&gt; realm known as &lt;a href=\"Fargrave\"&gt;Fargrave&lt;/a&gt; stagger the imagination. However, we are strangers here, unaware of the cultural subtext and necessary relationships that fuel trade through this Celestial Palanquin. For these reasons, I suggest we solicit the aid of a well-connected local. Someone with their thumb on the pulse of this planar crossroads. Someone who knows how business gets done across multiple realms of existence. Esteemed elders, allow me to introduce you to &lt;a href=\"Madam%20Whim\"&gt;Madam Whim&lt;/a&gt;.\nMadam Whim, a &lt;a href=\"Dark%20Seducer%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Dark Seducer&lt;/a&gt;, owns and operates the Fargravian landmark called the &lt;a href=\"House%20of%20Whims\"&gt;House of Whims&lt;/a&gt;. I'm not exactly certain what services this establishment offers, but it seems to deal in the proclivities of the city's inhabitants, &lt;a href=\"Daedra%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Daedra&lt;/a&gt; and mortal alike. Various Daedric assistants offer the strangest and most unusual diversions. That's the best word I can think of to describe it, for her business appears to trade in concepts and ideas rather than tangible goods. But even that isn't entirely accurate, for the Daedra I witnessed there certainly treated their transactions with the same care and delicacy that we would handle gold and trade goods.\nThis preamble aside, everyone I spoke to in Fargrave, from the lowliest &lt;a href=\"Dremora%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Dremora&lt;/a&gt; varlet to the various mortals and all the way up to the most fearsome Dremora officers, they all referred to Madam Whim in hushed tones and with great reverence. And perhaps even a hint of fear. Everyone who was willing to offer me an opinion confirmed that, if you could meet her price, Madam Whim was the Fargravian to see if you need information, some hard-to-get item, or anything else of value across the realms of Oblivion. Now, when I asked about what she charges for such assistance, I never received a clear answer. I chalk that up to my limited understanding of the currencies used in Fargrave and assume all will become clear in good time.\nMadam Whim obviously features prominently in Fargravian society. Every Daedra I interacted with knew of Madam Whim, spoke highly (if somewhat nervously) about her, and recommended her as a contact that House Hexos would require to successfully conduct business in the city. I was fortunate enough to acquire an audience with the grand Mazken (what the Dark Seducers refer to themselves as), and I must say the experience was extremely interesting. First, Madam Whim exudes charm and friendliness. She also radiates sensuality, but I assume that's true of all Dark Seducers. I haven't had the pleasure of meeting any others in such intimate surroundings. I visited with Madam Whim on the upper floor of the House of Whims, in a private room I assume she uses for all of her interviews. She was cordial, fascinating, and somewhat intoxicating. She made me feel special. Like we were the only two people that mattered, at least during that all-too-brief encounter. Here is what I learned during our discussion.\nWhen I inquired into what sort of business the House of Whims conducted, Madam Whim replied, \"I trade in eccentricities and capriciousness. My establishment carries indulgences and vices from across the many realms of Oblivion. I buy and sell as impulse dictates, my darling.\" I mentioned how I heard that Madam Whim knew all facets of handling business in Fargrave. That she knew where all the secrets were buried, as it were. \"Someone said that about me?\" she asked sweetly. \"How kind. Yes, I deal in information. All sorts of information. And the House of Whims serves food, drinks, and amenities for every appetite. It\u2019s what I specialize in.\"\nI explained that House Hexos was one of the leading trading houses in &lt;a href=\"Tamriel\"&gt;Tamriel&lt;/a&gt; and we were seeking to expand our operations to the newly discovered (from our point of view) realm of Fargrave. \"The relatively easy access to portals that connect to different realms presents us with extremely lucrative opportunities as far as trade is concerned,\" I said. Madam Whim nodded sagely before turning her liquid eyes upon me. It was like she was really looking at me for the first time. I wanted her to touch me, talk to me, whisper in my ear. It took every bit of willpower I possessed to keep my mind on the task at hand.\n\"I'm sure we can work something out, my darling,\" she purred. \"It would be nice to see a larger mortal presence in our fair city. Unlike my brother and sister Mazken, what you refer to as Dark Seducers, I prefer to use my charms to beguile and entice for knowledge and profit. I imagine you and your people can indulge me in both of those areas.\"\nIn summation, Madam Whim has the connections and reputation we need to introduce House Hexos to the larger Fargravian community. Moreover, she's willing to provide us with the help we need to establish our credentials, acquire office and warehouse space, and secure the permits and contracts necessary to move trade goods through Fargrave. Soon, we will have a robust network of planar trade routes to exploit. House Hexos will be famous across the realms as the merchants who can provide the most exotic goods and services. Just so long as we agree to meet Madam Whim\u2019s price for her assistance. She assures me the cost will be well within our means to afford."}

I hope that you and mother are well, and that little Sir Scruff hasn't given you too much trouble during my absence. Remember: two walks a day and no cookies!\nI hope you will forgive the lack of correspondence. My new employer has us traveling constantly. I certainly don't relish all the packing and unpacking, but I've seen the most amazing things these last few months! The cantons of &lt;a href=\"Vivec%20City%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Vivec City&lt;/a&gt;, the ruins of &lt;a href=\"Craglorn\"&gt;Craglorn&lt;/a&gt;, and the frigid heights of &lt;a href=\"Solitude%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Solitude&lt;/a&gt;. It's all so extraordinary!\nThe leader of this roving expedition calls herself &lt;a href=\"the%20Impresario\"&gt;the Impresario&lt;/a&gt;. We're encouraged to do likewise. I've thought about asking for her real name, but something tells me it would go poorly. She is wonderfully eccentric\u2014but in an uneven way that makes it very difficult to determine what is, and what is not, open for discussion. She has an effervescence about her that drives all of us to excel, even though none of us \"really\" know what we're doing.\nYou see, the Impresario's first (and perhaps only) passion is stories\u2014tales of derring-do specifically\u2014and she's willing to pay vast sums of treasure to get them. To that end, we offer challenges to adventurers from across &lt;a href=\"Tamriel\"&gt;Tamriel&lt;/a&gt;. When they return with tales of valor and victory, we give them prizes that would make even &lt;a href=\"High%20King%20Emeric%20%28Online%29\"&gt;King Emeric&lt;/a&gt; envious. It strikes me as a very odd business model, bound for financial ruin. But somehow, the Impresario's stores of arcane wonders never seem to run out.\nMy fellow employees tell all sorts of stories about her. Some believe she's just a wealthy eccentric with the kind of gold that can drive a person mad. Others believe she\u2019s some sort of witch who conjures the treasures up with spider legs, and lizard eyes, and bubbling cauldrons. Still others\u2014the real crackpots\u2014insist she\u2019s some sort of Demi-Prince of &lt;a href=\"Oblivion%20%28Realm%29\"&gt;Oblivion&lt;/a&gt; who takes mortal form to travel among us lowly mortals. Having never met a &lt;a href=\"Daedric\"&gt;Daedric&lt;/a&gt; anything, I suppose it's possible? But I highly doubt it. Nonetheless, there is something odd about her.\nSometimes, she talks about the distant past as if it were recent history. Other times, she talks about the future as if it's already been written. She seems completely disinterested in the more mundane news of the day, but not in the usual way. It\u2019s like anything less than the highest heights are completely below her notice. She's like one of those albatrosses that never land. Despite her peculiarity, I must admit I'm smitten. Professionally, I mean! After these grand adventures across the continent, I'll never be able to settle into trade again.\nI do hope you'll forgive me for being away so long, but I promise to send home treasures from the road. There\u2019s still so much more to see. With the Impresario, every day is a new adventure!\nYour loving brother,\n&lt;a href=\"Philius%20Dormier\"&gt;Philius&lt;/a&gt;"}

Wild beasts and wilder &lt;a href=\"Reachmen%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Reachfolk&lt;/a&gt; lurk in every cave and copse, lusting for blood and slaughter. Alas, a cartographer's work requires frequent excursions. Stout guards are a must, but a knowledgeable guide is no less important. Even now, a year into my stay, &lt;a href=\"The%20Reach%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Reach&lt;/a&gt; clan politics continue to be a mystery to me. Without local knowledge, a tense encounter can swiftly turn deadly.\nJust a few weeks ago, my coterie and I were charting the hills southeast of the city. One of my guards noticed a Reachfolk watching us from across a shallow ravine. Within moments, the number of observers grew from one, to four, to twelve. Eventually, the hooting started, followed by the banging of elk-skin drums. My escort drew their weapons and stood back-to-back\u2014a gesture that inspired louder shouts and more urgent drumming. As the witchmen drew nearer, I grew more and more certain that I would soon be dead. Just then, it all stopped. The frantic cacophony retreated to a whisper, and a woman emerged from behind a handful of the hulking barbarians.\nShe was tall, painted, and bedecked in feathers, skins, and bones. Despite her savage attire, she walked with a sovereign's poise, utterly unafraid of my sword-brandishing associates. My guide rushed forward and bowed\u2014a gesture of reverence I had never seen him perform before. The two exchanged words in the Reach-tongue, occasionally pointing to me and my fellows. At last, the woman placed her hand on my guide\u2019s head and approached.\nShe stood there staring at us for a long while before finally saying, \"Show me your teeth.\" I wasted no time, opening my mouth wide and leaning forward to give her a clear view. Many of my guards did likewise, with varying levels of enthusiasm. Unfortunately, one refused\u2014a proud &lt;a href=\"Nords%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Nord&lt;/a&gt; named Harulf. One of the woman's warriors stepped forward and roared, \"&lt;a href=\"Arana\"&gt;Arana&lt;/a&gt; says open your mouth, reeker!\" Still, the Nord refused. As the Reach warrior drew his bone-sword, the woman, Arana, raised her hand to quiet him. She gestured for us all to move and we eagerly agreed, leaving Harulf to face the Reach witch alone.\nAs she approached, she began muttering something in a language none of us understood. She rattled a bag of bones in her hand, all the while drawing closer to our Nord companion. As her muttering grew louder, I saw his face begin to twist. His lips quivered and his eyes went wide with terror. Suddenly, his mouth opened with a jolt. Arana peered inside, smiled, and relaxed her mysterious grip on him.\n\"Thank you for indulging me,\" she said. Despite the grim scene we witnessed, I couldn't help but share the Reachfolk's awe. Even with her grand appearance, she struck me as utterly without pretense. A witch, certainly, and a powerful one at that. But in her eyes I found a sort of breezy wisdom\u2014the kind of strength one finds in well-worn heroes who have met and conquered foes we could scarcely dream of.\nAs she returned to her war band, she issued one final admonition: \"&lt;a href=\"Vampire%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Vampires&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Werewolf%20%28Online%29\"&gt;werewolves&lt;/a&gt; stalk these hills.\" She turned to look at us and her face hardened. \"But not for much longer.\" With that, Arana and the Reachfolk vanished into the wilds like phantoms\u2014gone as quickly as they arrived.\n\"Who was that?\" I asked.\n\"Arana, leader of the witch-rebels,\" my guide responded.\nI needed no additional inspiration. I departed the Reach the very next day.\nIf you choose to stay in the Reach, I suggest you give the wilds a wide berth. If there are indeed vampires and werewolves in those hills, I believe Arana and her band of hunters will give them a proper war. And few people make war like the witches of the Reach."}

As my lady anticipated, the gift of a coffer full of jewels bought me the opportunity to present your proposal to the ruler of Markarth. Unfortunately, &lt;a href=\"Ard%20Caddach\"&gt;Ard Caddach&lt;/a&gt; is not inclined to consider any involvement in our current troubles. When I relate the final conversation I had with the Despot of Markarth, I think my lady will agree that there is little more I can do here.\nAs my lady instructed, I presented your gift and your letter to Caddach in the throne room of &lt;a href=\"Understone%20Keep%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Understone Keep&lt;/a&gt;. Caddach is a physically imposing man, a hale warlord of early middle age with a black beard and keen dark eyes. He dresses in the motley hide, leather, and bone favored by the &lt;a href=\"Reachmen%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Reachfolk&lt;/a&gt;, and wears a large broadsword at his hip even in his own throne room\u2014an altogether fierce and barbaric display, made only more intimidating by his habitual glower. \"Well?\" he demanded when I approached the throne. \"Who are you and what Imperial nonsense do you bring to my keep?\"\n\"Councilor Itinia of the &lt;a href=\"Elder%20Council\"&gt;Elder Council&lt;/a&gt; sends her greetings,\" I began. \"She has a proposal to lay before you, which she details in this letter. Shall I read it to you, my lord?\"\n\"Do you think me too uneducated to read it for myself?\" he asked me. \"Leave your letter and away with you.\" In fact, I had not heard that Caddach was literate\u2014so many Reachfolk are not. I thought it best not to mention this, though. I think I was fortunate he did not tear up my lady\u2019s missive in my face.\nCaddach did not send for me for eight days, and I despaired of ever gaining an audience. But finally one of his Stonehands (so his personal guard is known) came to bring me to him. To my surprise I was led not to the throne room of Understone Keep, but to the high ramparts of ancient &lt;a href=\"Dwemer\"&gt;Dwarven&lt;/a&gt; stonework that protect the city. Here I found Caddach standing on the walltop, the letter I had delivered tucked into his belt. A bitterly cold wind blew down from the snowy mountains to the north, and it was all I could do to keep my teeth from chattering aloud.\n\"My lord Blackdrake,\" I said, bowing.\n\"So this Itinia thinks to make me Emperor, does she?\" Caddach asked. It seemed he'd acquainted himself with the contents of my lady's missive after all.\n\"Yes, my lord,\" I replied. \"The Empress Regent has been missing for months. The Ruby Throne cannot be left empty. &lt;a href=\"Cyrodiil%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Cyrodiil&lt;/a&gt; needs you, my lord. All of &lt;a href=\"Tamriel\"&gt;Tamriel&lt;/a&gt; needs you. Only you can bring an end to this War of Three Banners.\"\n\"Cyrodiil needs me?\" Caddach laughed loudly. \"I\u2019ve no need for Cyrodiil, that I can tell you. They\u2019d murder me within a year if I tried to sit on that great Ruby Throne of yours.\"\n\"But you are the last of the Blackdrakes, the closest blood relation to the preceding dynasty,\" I protested. \"Who else has a better claim to the throne?\"\n\"The last of the Blackdrakes? Let me show you the last of the Blackdrakes,\" Caddach answered. Then he suddenly grasped my arm and yanked me right up to the edge of the high wall on which we stood. I flailed for balance, kept from falling to my death only by his iron grip. He pointed at the dark stone far below us.\n\"There lie the Blackdrakes!\" he snarled at me. \"My uncles, my cousins, all of them I could catch, broken and dead at the foot of this wall. I had them thrown down from this very spot because they were fools eager to make themselves puppets for your great lords and high houses. Your mistress doesn't want a new Longhouse Emperor. She wants a pet Reachman she can train to do her bidding.\n\"You tell Councilor Itinia that I am Caddach, the Ard of Markarth! Aye, called Despot by people like you! I have no clan, and the hard stone under my feet is throne enough for me. But if I ever come to Cyrodiil again it will be at the head of another Reach horde. Is that what your Lady Itinia wants?\"\nI confess I did not know how to answer Ard Caddach\u2019s question. I clung to his arm and said something like, \"No! Yes! I don\u2019t know!\" before Caddach dragged me back from the edge, sparing me. I concluded that our discussion was over and fled for my life.\nI hope this letter finds its way swiftly to my lady's hands. I shall await your instructions here in Markarth and stay out of Caddach\u2019s sight until I hear from you.

This entry was &lt;a href=\"https%3A//www.elderscrollsonline.com/en-us/news/post/58533\"&gt;published&lt;/a&gt; on 07/23/2020.\nContents.\nFrom the recent publication, Investigator Vale Does Not Cry Wolf: The Truth Behind the Hounds of Black Moor, by &lt;a href=\"Adandora\"&gt;Adandora&lt;/a&gt;, Chronicler-at-Large\nThe Hounds of Black Moor, one of the earliest &lt;a href=\"Investigator%20Vale\"&gt;Investigator Vale&lt;/a&gt; novels in the series, is considered instrumental in its widespread popularity. However, purists often criticize it as taking too many creative liberties and lacking the firm basis in reality that characterizes many of Vale's latter and more acclaimed adventures. Well, I'm here to tell you that those accusations are unfounded. It upholds the Vale series' reputation for being recountings of \u201ctrue-to-life\u201d adventures.\nDuring my research into the origins of the series, which I thoroughly outline in The Real Investigator Vale, I uncovered accounts of mysterious disappearances that bore striking similarities to those described in the novel. Intrigued, I packed my travel bag and departed for &lt;a href=\"Whiterun\"&gt;Whiterun&lt;/a&gt; with all due haste.\nThe events in question occurred around 2E 577, when the city was terrorized by the baying of crazed outsiders and the howling of &lt;a href=\"Wolf%20%28Online%29\"&gt;wolves&lt;/a&gt; that preceded nightly disappearances. Tensions within the city rose to a boiling point when a member of the &lt;a href=\"Clan%20Battle-Born\"&gt;Battle-Born&lt;/a&gt; family was found naked, covered in blood, and surrounded by dead livestock on the &lt;a href=\"Clan%20Gray-Mane\"&gt;Gray-Mane&lt;/a&gt; estate. Accusations of &lt;a href=\"Lycanthropy%20%28Online%29\"&gt;lycanthropy&lt;/a&gt; and calls for executions nearly brought the situation to a head before a visiting stranger offered to investigate the matter and received the jarl's blessing.\nNow, if you're familiar with the book (or don't mind having the ending revealed, if you aren't), Investigator Vale navigates the complicated dispute of two fictitious families under much the same circumstances. She, through her usual expert deductions, discovers that none of the alleged shapeshifters and crazed outsiders who came tearing through town like beasts suffered from the disease of lycanthropy, but they all had the same stains on their teeth. After much intrigue, deceit, and attempted murder, the cunning Vale catches the young court alchemist, Morhjartyr, in the act of poisoning the jarl with a beastly concoction that changed them into a terrifying werewolf. She chases her fugitive suspect back to his hideaway in Black Moor Keep, all while the ravenous jarl nips at her heels. All this culminates in a dramatic conclusion atop the keep's battlements, where Vale baits the overconfident Morhjartyr into a trap that knocks both him and the ravenous jarl from the high walls. Neither were ever seen again.\nMuch of this fateful encounter is not verifiable, but through exhaustive questioning and scouring of the local records, I uncovered that the unnamed stranger resolved the feud between the Battle-Borns and Gray-Manes, finding neither family at fault. Both the jarl and court alchemist vanished under mysterious circumstances during the upheaval, leading some to claim they co-conspired against the two powerful families. That remains purely conjecture, but it did not stop the newly ascended jarl from declaring &lt;a href=\"Arkasis\"&gt;Arkasis&lt;/a&gt;, the young alchemist, a menace of the highest order.\nIn the novel, Morhjartyr is never seen again and many presumed that he would return in a future entry as a formidable nemesis for the savvy Vale, but thus far the young alchemist has not reappeared in the author's works. However, the young fugitive, Arkasis, as it turns out, had more of a story to tell. I followed that name to three holds across the &lt;a href=\"Skyrim%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Skyrim&lt;/a&gt;, each with their own local legend of a mad alchemist who had been caught conducting unspeakable experiments on unwilling test subjects. These tests ranged from the lurid to the bizarre, involving strange alchemical substances and terrible transformations. Each time, this mad alchemist evaded justice and began anew, growing bolder in his work until he inevitably exposed his own misdeeds. To this day, he continues to elude capture. I believe these mad alchemists are all the same person\u2014none other than the infamous Arkasis of Whiterun.\nFrom all these sundry (and sometimes sordid) sources, I pieced together a picture of Arkasis from the flotsam of truth floating in the sea of fiction that surrounds him. First, he is in fact a man\u2014a &lt;a href=\"Nords%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Nord&lt;/a&gt; like Morhjartyr, to be exact\u2014who is rapidly approaching middle age. Of an unusually large stature, which I speculate is the result of profuse alchemical enhancement, Arkasis is described as a reclusive academic. He possesses a domineering and superior attitude toward others, seeing no one as his equal, yet he always seeks out sycophants to admire his own brilliance. This need for recognition always leads to his nefarious schemes coming to light. I can say, after hearing the tales told by the torch-wielding mob that chased him from their hold, that his experiments consist of ingenious designs with a blood-curdling disregard for suffering.\nCoincidentally, the events described in the Hounds of Black Moor and those that plagued Whiterun itself happen to coincide with an unexpected delay in the travels of one Lady Arabelle Davaux, bound for &lt;a href=\"Vvardenfell%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Vvardenfell&lt;/a&gt;. I suspect that the reason we haven\u2019t seen the return of Morhjartyr in the Investigator Vale series stems from the fact that the author never uncovered what became of him herself. If you're reading this, Lady Arabelle, and wish to finally admit that you are the author and inspiration behind Vale, I would be absolutely willing to share what I've learned about the heinous crimes of one Arkasis, the Mad Alchemist. And all for the small price of that admission and a mention in your acknowledgements. Until then, the secrets of Morhjartyr\u2014and Arkasis the Mad Alchemist\u2014remain safe with me!"}

I am writing to warn you about a problem. A mage named &lt;a href=\"Bastian%20Hallix\"&gt;Bastian Hallix&lt;/a&gt; is asking questions about gambling dens in &lt;a href=\"Leyawiin%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Leyawiin\u2019s&lt;/a&gt; harbor districts. He represents the Silvelles, a noble trading house of &lt;a href=\"Daggerfall%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Daggerfall&lt;/a&gt;, and he believes that some egg-kin of the family\u2014a fellow named Quistley Silvelle\u2014may have visited businesses under your control. I doubt that Bastian Hallix knows or cares who runs things in Leyawiin, but he intends to follow this Quistley\u2019s trail wherever it might lead. It seems likely that, sooner or later, he will wind up at the door to your hut.\nNormally, I would not worry myself about your nest. You know best how to manage your own business. But this Bastian Hallix is a talented &lt;a href=\"Battlemage\"&gt;Battlemage&lt;/a&gt;, handy with both staff and sword, and he is nothing if not determined. He is the sort of dryskin who kicks down or blows up any obstacle you put in his path, as I learned the hard way. Earlier today, Bastian Hallix\u2019s search for Quistley Silvelle led him to me. I have nothing to do with any missing Silvelles, but I don't stand for anyone prying into my affairs. I sent three of my blades to waylay him when he returned to his inn. Hallix roasted poor Neriemus with a fire bolt, knocked Janetia senseless with a single blow from his staff, and then disarmed Claws-in-Shadow and stabbed him with his own sword.\nAfter that xulunaht, I decided to look into what he wanted and how to get rid of him.\nMy spies learned that Bastian Hallix's egg-sire was Lord Martel Hallix of Daggerfall. Lord Hallix angered &lt;a href=\"High%20King%20Emeric%20%28Online%29\"&gt;High King Emeric&lt;/a&gt; many years ago\u2014how, my sources did not say\u2014and the house was stripped of its lands and titles. Bastian was fostered with the Silvelle family and grew up under their roof. He works for the family as a roving troubleshooter, looking after their interests wherever they do business. He acts like more of a hired specialist than a lord's son, but be careful with him. The Silvelles have gold, and we don't want to stumble into a fight with them.\nYou will know Bastian when you see him. He is a fit, red-headed mage of thirty years or so, and he appears to exist in a constant state of annoyance\u2014I don't think he's happy being sent to fetch a wayward Silvelle. Don't be misled by his hemming and hawing. He acts like he lacks confidence and fears confrontation, but it turns out he is more about actions than words.\nFortunately, he is also a trusting sort. When he returned to me after my crew ambushed him, I had little trouble convincing him I had nothing to do with it and sent him on his way. Feed him a likely story, and you should be able to keep him out of your mud pit. For a time, anyway.\nHallix has the persistence of a hungry &lt;a href=\"haj%20mota\"&gt;haj mota&lt;/a&gt;. Make it a good story, and make sure it sends him far away from &lt;a href=\"Blackwood%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Blackwood&lt;/a&gt;. That's my advice. Use it as you may.\nPungent Adder"}

This entry was published on August 14th, 2019.\nContents.\n&lt;a href=\"Zeira\"&gt;Zeira&lt;/a&gt; copied the letters as you requested, down to the last detail. I would say you could pass these off for the originals, but the wand is mightier than the quill and this is the &lt;a href=\"Tharns\"&gt;Tharns&lt;/a&gt; we\u2019re talking about. Most of the &lt;a href=\"Clivia%20Tharn\"&gt;Empress Regent&lt;/a&gt;\u2019s letters were old news. If I had to guess why they paid so much to recover them from &lt;a href=\"Imperial%20City%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Imperial City&lt;/a&gt;, I\u2019d say it has something to do with this Renald character. I\u2019m sure they\u2019d be willing to pay to know his whereabouts should that information come our way.\n\u2014&lt;a href=\"Walks-Softly\"&gt;Walks-Softly&lt;/a&gt;\n\u201cClivia,\nYour father is about to embark on a foolish, desperate mission to save the &lt;a href=\"Empire\"&gt;Empire&lt;/a&gt;. Though I have said as much to &lt;a href=\"Varen%20Aquilarios%20%28Online%29\"&gt;the Emperor&lt;/a&gt;, he insists that this errand is necessary for the stability of his domain. Regardless, his restlessness on the subject poses a real threat to his ability to govern. I must spare you the details of this journey, but if the &lt;a href=\"Mannimarco%20%28Online%29\"&gt;puddle-scrying High Elf\u2019s&lt;/a&gt; plan works, your first child will inherit the whole of &lt;a href=\"Tamriel\"&gt;Tamriel&lt;/a&gt;. I trust you will keep the &lt;a href=\"Elder%20Council\"&gt;Elder Council&lt;/a&gt; in check while I\u2019m traipsing across the countryside with a divining rod like some &lt;a href=\"Bravil%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Bravil&lt;/a&gt; yokel. It\u2019s best that I do not expose the details here, but I will remain in touch.\u201d\n\u201cAs I feared, despite our efforts to remain inconspicuous, a group like ours attracts attention. We might have been more successful had we hitched &lt;a href=\"Lyris%20Titanborn%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Lyris&lt;/a&gt; to a cart. And if &lt;a href=\"Sai%20Sahan%20%28Online%29\"&gt;the swordmaster&lt;/a&gt; weren\u2019t allergic to wearing a shirt. As it stands, a group of riders started shadowing our trail at least four days ago. We only barely noticed them, so it could have been far longer. If you do not receive word from me a week from the date of this letter, assume the worst and notify the &lt;a href=\"Imperial%20Legion%20%28Online%29\"&gt;legions&lt;/a&gt; to begin a search.\u201d\n\u201cThe riders surrounded us in &lt;a href=\"Pale%20Pass\"&gt;Pale Pass&lt;/a&gt;, which I can\u2019t help but find ironic considering they were &lt;a href=\"Akaviri\"&gt;Akaviri&lt;/a&gt;, or at least making every effort to look the part. I almost laughed at the bandits putting on such an act until I noticed the make of their armor. It was a style I had not seen for more than a century: that of &lt;a href=\"Reman%20Cyrodiil\"&gt;Reman&lt;/a&gt;\u2019s &lt;a href=\"Dragonguard\"&gt;Dragonguard&lt;/a&gt;. I didn\u2019t recognize any of their number, but their leader gave me a look that said he knew exactly who we were. His heritage was evident in his eyes and hair. Too evident, I might say. Many &lt;a href=\"Imperials%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Imperials&lt;/a&gt; with Akaviri ancestry are only barely indistinguishable from pure Cyrodilic stock. He invited us to parlay, though it was obvious that the request was a formality. Varen wisely acquiesced.\nHe introduced himself as &lt;a href=\"Chevalier%20Renald\"&gt;Chevalier Renald&lt;/a&gt;, an obvious pseudonym I\u2019d never heard before. I suspected he wanted to know why the Emperor and &lt;a href=\"Chancellor\"&gt;Chancellor&lt;/a&gt; were blundering through the wilderness escorted by a handful of oddities. I did not expect him to reveal a frightening foreknowledge of our quest. He knew precisely what Varen sought. What he wanted to know was why. I could see that Varen strugged with the decision to deceive the so-called Dragonguard, so I stepped in by offering a half-truth: that Varen sought to relight the &lt;a href=\"Dragonfires\"&gt;Dragonfires&lt;/a&gt; and restore the Empire.\nRenald fixed me with a hard gaze that almost mesmerized, and I\u2019ll admit it took all my composure to maintain an impassive visage. I don\u2019t believe I came under any spell, but it seemed as if he looked straight into my soul. If he saw through my deception, he did not say so. Instead, he offered to assist Varen in locating our prize. Renald and Varen clasped arms and swore an accord on their honor. I know such gestures hold meaning to the likes of Varen and Sai Sahan, but I remain skeptical of its value to this Chevalier Renald.\nClivia, I want you to learn more about this man and his company, discreetly. The only way he could have known about the Companions\u2019 mission is if he had connections far too close to the Emperor for my liking.\u201d"}

I haven't heard from you since before &lt;a href=\"Emperor%20Leovic\"&gt;Emperor Leovic&lt;/a&gt; bled out on his own throne. To be frank, I thought you were dead.\nAs to the matter of your request, yes, I do know of an adventurer who would be perfect for the task as you described it. I will say that you were purposely vague on many of the pertinent details, but I got the general idea. I suggest you contact &lt;a href=\"Eveli%20Sharp-Arrow\"&gt;Eveli Sharp-Arrow&lt;/a&gt; and offer her the job.\nLet me tell you about Eveli Sharp-Arrow. She\u2019s a &lt;a href=\"Bosmer%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Wood Elf&lt;/a&gt;, born and raised in &lt;a href=\"Valenwood%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Valenwood&lt;/a&gt;. She has very little experience in the wider world, but her heart's that of a true adventurer. I've been watching her with great interest since coming here after the fall of the &lt;a href=\"Longhouse%20Emperors\"&gt;Longhouse Emperors&lt;/a&gt;. Even though it's no longer my stock in trade, I can't help looking for and evaluating talent. And although she's young and untested, Eveli possesses an excess of talent.\nFirst, Eveli comes from a long line of Wood Elf hunters, scouts, and warriors. All of that tradition and training is evident in the way she carries herself: with confidence and determination. She's an expert with the bow, her weapon of choice, and I've seen her loose a dozen arrows in rapid succession, each shaft hitting its mark. In a land of skilled archers, this young woman stands above them all as a master despite her tender age.\nSecond, Eveli reads every book she can get her hands on. Novels, histories, lineages\u2014she devours them all. She particularly loves adventure stories and mysteries, however, and tells anyone who will listen that her personal hero is the fictitious &lt;a href=\"Investigator%20Vale\"&gt;Investigator Vale&lt;/a&gt;. Since part of your task involved the retrieval of an ancient tome, this aspect of her personality will serve you well.\nThird, I'm not the only one to have noticed young Eveli's special talents. The Eyes of the Queen have been watching her as well, though I doubt they realize that they\u2019ve been recognized. I'm much better at spycraft than this particular agent of &lt;a href=\"Queen%20Ayrenn%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Queen Ayrenn&lt;/a&gt;. I recommend you contact Eveli immediately and offer her the adventure she craves before you lose her to the &lt;a href=\"Aldmeri%20Dominion%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Aldmeri Dominion&lt;/a&gt;. As I believe I've made clear, she\u2019s the ideal candidate for the job you need handled.\nEveli Sharp-Arrow is eager to prove herself and find adventure. She has a big heart and the courage of a dozen Elves, but her naivet\u00e9 and inexperience can be used to manipulate her in ways that would not be possible with a more seasoned operative. She has the skill and bravery to get the job done, and she\u2019s determined to make a name for herself. What could be more perfect for your purposes?\nI've seen her do some amazing things here in Valenwood. That bow of hers \u2026 it's like an extension of her body. She can empty a quiver in a few seconds, with each loosed arrow finding the exact target she aimed for. She's bright and cheerful to a fault, has the curiosity of a &lt;a href=\"Khajiit%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Khajiit&lt;/a&gt;, and loves to quote Wood Elf wisdom to anyone who will listen. It's all part of her charm.\nSo, Farrul, Eveli Sharp-Arrow is exactly who you need. Trust me when I say this. This young Wood Elf will accomplish everything you need and then some. Have I ever failed you before?\nAuditia Lentulus, Former Spymaster to the Longhouse Emperors"}

I was there the night &lt;a href=\"Count%20Verandis%20Ravenwatch\"&gt;Count Verandis Ravenwatch&lt;/a&gt; brought home a new ward. The vampire scholar, Fennorian. Oh, right. Forgive me. I forget that not everyone is privy to the darkest secrets of the kingdom. This isn\u2019t public knowledge, but Verandis is a vampire. In fact, each member of &lt;a href=\"House%20Ravenwatch\"&gt;House Ravenwatch&lt;/a&gt; is a vampire. Don't be concerned. They're good vampires. And the count and the king have a relationship. They\u2019re friends of a sort, I suppose you could say. They share a mutual respect, at the very least, but I believe it goes deeper than that.\nAnyway, I was at Castle Ravenwatch, waiting to deliver a message to Count Verandis. He wasn't in residence, but his wards expected him shortly and happily let me wait. The storm that battered the castle throughout the day only intensified as darkness fell. The wards, &lt;a href=\"Adusa-daro\"&gt;Adusa-daro&lt;/a&gt; the &lt;a href=\"Khajiit%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Khajiit&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Gwendis\"&gt;Gwendis&lt;/a&gt; the &lt;a href=\"Bosmer%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Wood Elf&lt;/a&gt;, were enjoying a late supper with their blood-servant, Kalin. We were having a nice enough talk, but it was all I could do not to leap up and make them take their fangs out of that poor man. He offered his blood willingly, I had to keep telling myself. And they weren't draining him dry. Finally, the doors to the great hall flew wide, revealing Count Verandis in the open entryway.\nThe count stood tall and regal, lightning flashing behind him as thunder boomed. He wasn't alone. Standing beside him, dripping wet and looking like a lost puppy, was a skinny &lt;a href=\"Altmer%20%28Online%29\"&gt;High Elf&lt;/a&gt; with a dazed expression.\n\"Look what the count dragged in,\" purred Adusa.\n\"Looks yummy,\" Gwendis added. \u201cIs that for us?\"\n\"Mind your manners, child,\" Verandis said with his usual mixture of austerity and affection as he led his companion into the hall, \"and say hello to your new brother, Fennorian.\"\nPhysically, Fennorian appeared closer in age to Gwendis than to Adusa. As he dried by the fire, I couldn't help but notice his long, unruly hair, his smoldering gaze, and his serious expression. I'm old enough to be the young man's grand\u2014er, older sister\u2014but I'm still passionate enough to recognize allure when I see it. The fact that Fennorian was unaware of his effect on those around him made him even more desirable. Which may have been one of the reasons I went out of my way to visit the castle whenever I was near Rivenspire after that.\nThe next few times I visited the castle, Fennorian was always in residence. We talked while he conducted &lt;a href=\"Alchemy%20%28Online%29\"&gt;alchemical&lt;/a&gt; experiments or studied a stack of scrolls or tomes from the count's extensive library. He served as researcher for the rest of House Ravenwatch, who busily performed the count's work throughout the land. The Ravenwatch, you see, in addition to being a prominent noble family, has also dedicated itself to dealing with hostile vampire clans, rogue &lt;a href=\"bloodfiend\"&gt;bloodfiend&lt;/a&gt;s, and other similar threats to the realm. For the time being, at least, the count preferred to keep Fennorian close to home. The brooding scholar had yet to go into the field, and that was starting to make him even more subdued.\nI never got Fennorian to tell me much about where he came from or how Verandis found him. If anything, the topic made him uncomfortable, so I didn't press the issue. I don't think Verandis sired him, but I do get the impression that they are related in some way. Given how old the count actually is, I\u2019m assuming that Fennorian is a distant descendant of some sort. Whatever the truth of all that, the young man and the count clearly share a special bond. Verandis is his father in every way that counts, and Fennorian is his son. Beyond that, I\u2019m just guessing, but I believe that whatever situation drew them together was terrible for Fennorian. Why else would he refuse to talk about it?\nDuring my most recent visit to the castle, the place was alive with activity. Adusa and Gwendis were preparing to depart for a mission of their own, while Fennorian ran back and forth between half a dozen alchemical workstations. He added something to one, removed something from another, and then combined the contents of a beaker from a third with a vial from a fourth. A puff of blue smoke arose from the vial, which caused a slight smile to briefly illuminate the vampire scholar\u2019s face. He turned and handed the vial to a member of the &lt;a href=\"Shornhelm%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Shornhelm&lt;/a&gt; Guard. \"Take this to the healers. That should take care of the epidemic.\" Once again, the young vampire impressed me with his quick thinking and scientific approach to every problem. With a lull in the action, I decided to get to the business that brought me to the castle.\n\"Adusa-daro,\" I said, addressing the eldest of Verandis's wards, \"may I speak with the count? I come with an urgent matter on behalf of the king.\"\nThe Khajiit shook her head. \"Count Verandis is \u2026 unavailable. How can this one assist you?\"\nVerandis not in residence wasn't unusual, and I had dealt with Adusa in the past. I quickly explained the situation. Scouts near &lt;a href=\"Bangkorai%20Garrison\"&gt;Bangkorai Garrison&lt;/a&gt; spotted a group of &lt;a href=\"Nords%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Nord&lt;/a&gt; mercenaries that call themselves the Draugrkin sneaking around nearby caverns. King Emeric wanted Count Verandis to look into the matter. Adusa thought for a moment, then nodded as an idea came to mind.\n\"Adusa and Gwendis have their own task to complete,\" she said, \"but this one thinks Fennorian is ready to leave the castle for a short time.\"\nFennorian appeared as surprised as Gwendis at this proclamation. He began to protest, but Adusa silenced him with a slight gesture. She looked at him, waiting, until he lowered his own gaze and said, \"Yes, sister. I understand. I\u2019m ready.\"\nI watched as the trio headed off, Adusa and Gwendis to whatever Ravenwatch crisis required their attention, Fennorian with his pack full of books and alchemical supplies to investigate the Draugrkin. I just hoped that Verandis had trained him as well as he did his other wards. I had a feeling there was more to the Draugrkin than either I or King Emeric suspected."}

This entry was &lt;a href=\"https%3A//www.elderscrollsonline.com/en-us/news/post/59099\"&gt;published&lt;/a&gt; on 11/05/2020.\nContents.\n\"From a report by Lady Nilene Devieren, Royal Envoy to &lt;a href=\"The%20Reach%20%28Online%29\"&gt;the Reach&lt;/a&gt;\"\nIn the first week of , I traveled to &lt;a href=\"Markarth%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Markarth&lt;/a&gt; to negotiate with the Despot, &lt;a href=\"Ard%20Caddach\"&gt;Ard Caddach&lt;/a&gt;, on the question of &lt;a href=\"Reachmen%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Reachfolk&lt;/a&gt; raids along &lt;a href=\"High%20Rock%20%28Online%29\"&gt;High Rock\u2019s&lt;/a&gt; borders. Upon arrival, I learned that before I would be permitted to state &lt;a href=\"High%20King%20Emeric%20%28Online%29\"&gt;High King Emeric's&lt;/a&gt; case to the Despot, I would first need to persuade his chief advisor, the &lt;a href=\"Lady%20Belain\"&gt;Lady Belain&lt;/a&gt;, to arrange a meeting. Fortunately, Lady Belain had no objection to hearing me out.\nBefore I relate the details of our discussion, let me explain Lady Belain\u2019s position in Markarth. As the Despot's close confidante, she is never far from his side. Oddly enough, no one I spoke to in the Reach knew exactly when or how she came to wield such influence. From what I could ascertain, she first appeared during the period when Caddach ruled the city as Imperial Governor under Emperor Moricar. Many foreigners came to Markarth in those days; Lady Belain represented herself as a &lt;a href=\"Bretons%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Breton&lt;/a&gt; noble from an obscure family, with certain scholarly and arcane interests in the Reach. She established a household in Markarth's heights, bringing with her a small number of closemouthed servants and importing luxurious furnishings from distant lands.\nSoon after she settled in the city, Lady Belain began advising Caddach on both arcane questions and diplomatic matters. She quickly gained a reputation for her wily political instincts, using soft words and subtlety to temper the Despot's sternness. The people of Markarth called her Caddach's \"keep-witch.\" Now, witches are greatly respected by the Reachfolk, but in Lady Belain's case, the term is not entirely complimentary. I learned that \"keep-witches\" are seen as overly political. In the eyes of most Reachfolk, witches should deal with the elements and the spirits; witches who stand close to a throne are not to be trusted.\nMy conversation with Lady Belain began with the usual pleasantries. Lady Belain asked about my journey and if I was comfortable in the quarters I had secured in Markarth. In truth, I was surprised to find myself discussing such matters. In my previous visits to Markarth, no Reachfolk had expressed even the least solicitude for my comforts, yet here I sat sipping tea with a lady of high breeding.\nWhen the time came, I turned the conversation to the High King's message. \"I thank you for your welcome, my lady, but I must now bring up the business of my visit,\" I began. \"The depredations of the &lt;a href=\"Bloodthorn%20Cult\"&gt;Bloodthorn Cult&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Glenumbra%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Glenumbra&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Dark%20Witnesses\"&gt;Dark Witnesses&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Mournoth%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Mournoth&lt;/a&gt; are simply intolerable. The High King wishes peace along his borders, but when Reachfolk raid our towns and burn our farms, there can be no peace. They say you have Ard Caddach's ear. Can you not convince him to rein in the clans that are running wild before they draw us into a war neither of us want?\"\nLady Belain weighed my question for a long moment. I observed that she had an unusual manner to her; young enough to be regarded as a great beauty, yet her eyes seemed to hold an unsettling depth of wisdom and experience. \"The Bloodthorns and the Dark Witnesses are indeed a problem,\" she finally answered. \"But the ard will not command them to do as your high king bids. Caddach cannot be seen to act as Emeric's lapdog.\"\n\"My lady, I must at least make the attempt,\" I protested. \"You must be able to do something.\"\nAgain Belain regarded me with those dark, deep eyes. \"If Emeric were to strike a hard blow against the clans that badger your border,\" she said, \"they will appeal to Ard Caddach for help. This will put him in a position to offer them protection from you. That will give him a hold on them.\"\nI frowned, not sure I understood her correctly. \"You're telling us to attack your own people?\"\n\"I am telling you to do nothing,\" Lady Belain answered. \"I merely say what will happen if you strike a blow in your own behalf.\"\n\"That is not much help. I came here because High King Emeric hopes to avoid a fight.\"\n\"Oh, but we are not talking of this season\u2019s troubles,\" Lady Belain said. \"We are talking of ending these troubles for years to come. If that is your king's wish, then he will find that strengthening Ard Caddach's hand is the wisest strategy he can pursue. Instead of dealing with a dozen intractable clans, he can deal with one king in the Reach. Helping Ard Caddach is in your own best interest.\"\nI considered that point, and I must say, it seemed so reasonable, so attractive, that my mission almost ended right there. I saw myself returning to &lt;a href=\"Wayrest%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Wayrest&lt;/a&gt; to explain the cleverness of Lady Belain's plan, basking in the praise I would certainly receive for bringing it to the high king. But some stubborn seed of doubt lingered in my mind.\n\"It may be as you say, my lady,\" I managed, \"but I am charged with taking my king's words to the Despot of Markarth. I cannot leave without doing that.\"\nLady Belain's eyes flashed, and I sensed that it would not be wise to anger her. Something perilous moved behind that gentle countenance, I felt sure of it. But even as I shrank in my seat, she smiled coolly at me. \"Well, you must do what you must,\" she said. \"I will see to it that you meet Ard Caddach. He will grumble, dismiss your concerns, and in the end give you no answer. Afterward, come back to me. I will help you find a way to explain it to your high king.\"\nTroubled by her words, I took my leave soon after. Two days later, my conversation with the Despot of Markarth went exactly as Lady Belain had foretold. But instead of returning to the keep-witch, I decided to set down this report and seal it.\nI find that I am not sure what mind I'll be in after I speak with Lady Belain again."}

This entry was &lt;a href=\"https%3A//www.elderscrollsonline.com/en-us/news/post/58495\"&gt;published&lt;/a&gt; on 07/14/2020.\nContents.\nA Summary and a Warning\nBy &lt;a href=\"Fennorian\"&gt;Fennorian&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"House%20Ravenwatch\"&gt;House Ravenwatch&lt;/a&gt;\nFirst, please accept my apologies for the delayed response to your inquiry, dear &lt;a href=\"Gwendis\"&gt;Gwendis&lt;/a&gt;. I know that in the past we may not have always seen eye to eye on our responsibilities to House Ravenwatch, but please believe that I would never intentionally slight or disrespect you. Even when our arguments become heated, I never forget that you are my sister. Our mutual dedication to Lord Verandis\u2019s cause transcends any minor bickering between the two of us.\nSpeaking of our house\u2019s mission, the reason for my delay is related. Your letter requesting information on &lt;a href=\"Lady%20Thorn\"&gt;Lady Thorn&lt;/a&gt; arrived just after I set out to &lt;a href=\"Bangkorai\"&gt;Bangkorai&lt;/a&gt;. Rumors of a previously unknown ancient gravesite reached my ears and I decided it worthy of investigation. I must tell you of the incredible adventure I had within\u2014I met a woman there who reminded me of you in many ways\u2014but that can wait for a future conversation. Suffice it to say, I may now understand your attraction to and excitement for field research.\nUpon returning to &lt;a href=\"Ravenwatch%20Castle\"&gt;Ravenwatch Castle&lt;/a&gt;, I immediately set to work digging up any references to Lady Thorn that I could find. Your ignorance of her is well justified. Very little regarding that name appears in the Vampiric Index that &lt;a href=\"Verandis\"&gt;Verandis&lt;/a&gt; established. A surprise, considering her title of \u201cLady\u201d implies a connection to aristocracy. I began to wonder if she were merely a tale the rural Nords tell each other while waiting for hunks of horker meat to boil. She would not be the first phantom we chased after.\nBut then I recalled your description of her castle on &lt;a href=\"Western%20Skyrim\"&gt;Skyrim\u2019s western border&lt;/a&gt; near the Reach. In your letter, you wrote that its design appeared vampiric. Or, as you put it, \u201cit has all those awful pointy bits that our people like to put on things.\u201d Although I agree with you about the tediousness of vampiric architecture, it did provide a clue to learning more about Lady Thorn\u2019s past.\nYou see, I don\u2019t believe that Lady Thorn was the original occupant of that castle. Records from &lt;a href=\"Solitude%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Solitude&lt;/a&gt; indicate that a clan of vampires appropriately calling themselves the &lt;a href=\"Snowbrood\"&gt;Snowbrood&lt;/a&gt; constructed the castle sometime around the seventh century of the &lt;a href=\"First%20Era\"&gt;First Era&lt;/a&gt;. I cannot pinpoint the exact date because, as you know, the &lt;a href=\"Nords%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Nords&lt;/a&gt; do not practice fastidious record keeping. However, they do mention the Snowbrood built the castle using local slave labor. They frequently raided local villages at night, capturing people strong enough for labor. Apparently, the clan would work them to near death, then drain them of blood and return the corpse to their home village, sometimes propping the body up at a dinner table or bed in a grim mockery of life.\nYou might agree that this type of flashy evil does not align with what we know of Lady Thorn. Her reclusiveness is the one trait that we have any certainty about. But I found more. After the Snowbrood completed the castle, the raids slowed but did not cease. The locals would not hear from the vampires for years, sometimes decades, and then another attack would come. They describe the raids as purposeless\u2014viciousness for its own sake. Afterward, the Snowbrood would once again go quiet.\nThen, in &lt;a href=\"1E%201030\"&gt;1E 1030&lt;/a&gt;, an &lt;a href=\"Altmer%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Altmer&lt;/a&gt; woman arrived in the area. The stories describe her as dignified, refined, and slightly snobbish. One Nord writes, \u201cJust as the last beam of light fell under the horizon, this Elf woman appears on horseback. She was pretty, as far as Elves go. I don\u2019t know that I\u2019d ever seen clothing as fine as hers, nor may I ever again. She wasn\u2019t dressed for the cold, that\u2019s for sure. But I never saw it bother her.\u201d\n\u201cAs she came up to the night-fire of my guard post, I heard her call out and request a meeting with our jarl. Her tone sounded like a demand, despite her polite words. I had me a bit of a chuckle and replied that our little village hadn\u2019t quite earned a jarl yet. She huffed a bit then asked for whoever runs the town. Well, obviously I can\u2019t just go fetch him for any old passerby, so I asked her business. That\u2019s when she tells us that she can wipe out the Snowbrood. You can bet for sure I ran and grabbed Thornir then.\u201d\nI reviewed several accounts from the handful of small villages that surrounded what\u2019s now called &lt;a href=\"Castle%20Thorn\"&gt;Castle Thorn&lt;/a&gt;, and they all roughly match in the details. This mysterious Altmer arrives at sundown and requests a meeting with the leading decision-makers. In those meetings, she claims the ability to wipe out the Snowbrood and end the raids. In exchange she requests ownership of the castle in perpetuity. Since the Nords want nothing to do with the accursed place, they all agree to her terms. Afterward, she tells the villagers that once smoke rises from the castle, the may feel safe. The Snowbrood would be no more.\nOnly one report exists of the last time someone saw her outside the castle. I include it in full below:\n\u201cI watched the Elf woman on her horse head toward the gate that blocks the pass up the mountain. The others told me to leave her alone, but I\u2019d never seen an Elf before and she acted so strange. I followed behind her at a distance, hoping she didn\u2019t see me. As we got closer to the castle, she stopped and looked directly at me. No idea how she knew I was there\u2014I\u2019m known as the best creeper in the village. But when I saw her face, something had changed. Her eyes turned black and her skin gray. All she said to me was, \u2018Your curiosity satisfied is not worth your life, little one.\u2019 Then she rode off up the hill.\u201d\n\u201cI stayed there catching my breath for a bit. I mean, she just looked so scary. That\u2019s when I heard the screams from the castle. They\u2019d rise up through the air, and then cut off suddenly. From where I stood, I could tell the screaming came from different parts of the castle. Like she was moving through it room by room. After a while it went silent. Then the smoke appeared, just as she said it would. But she didn\u2019t mention that it would smell. It reminded me of when the hunters bring back a mammoth and we gather around the cook pit and eat as much as we can. Anyway, I ran home and never saw the Elf lady again.\u201d\nGwendis, if this story is genuinely about Lady Thorn, I believe it should cause you great concern. This vampire eliminated an entire clan of vicious horrors entirely by herself. The strength she must wield could overwhelm the entire House Ravenwatch, let alone just one member. Perhaps we should take her reticence for social interaction as a sign to leave her alone.\nI can imagine your eye roll. I would never ask that you not pursue an investigation. However, please heed my warning. I couldn\u2019t bear to lose one of our family.\nWith sincerity and devotion,\nYour brother, Fennorian"}

I have heard the word of the Dread Lady, and I bring enlightenment from my lovely and powerful mistress!\nAs the humble prophet of &lt;a href=\"Lyranth\"&gt;Lyranth&lt;/a&gt;, a &lt;a href=\"Dremora%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Dremora&lt;/a&gt; of great guile and cunning, know that my words hold truth and revelation. Like me, you too can bask in the Dread Lady\u2019s aura and gain wisdom beyond measure. All you have to do is believe!\nLet me tell you about the Dread Lady. Bear in mind, I am too lowly to speak of my mistress in anything more than euphemisms and hushed tones. Lyranth is the darkness in the dead of night, the arcane fire burning in &lt;a href=\"%5BOblivion%20%28Realm%29\"&gt;Oblivion&lt;/a&gt;. She has served &lt;a href=\"Molag%20Bal%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Molag Bal&lt;/a&gt; and walked her own path. She has strode upon the broken rocks of &lt;a href=\"Coldharbour\"&gt;Coldharbour&lt;/a&gt; and explored the farthest reaches of the Void. She is unique among her kind, for she has a burning curiosity and an unlikely interest in the happenings of little mortals, such as ourselves. No other &lt;a href=\"Daedra%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Daedra&lt;/a&gt; is her equal, and I am blessed that she has chosen me to bring her thoughts and words to the world at large.\nOf course, those words must be disguised so as not to worry the locals. I find that most folk see anything related to Daedra as evil and dangerous. Nothing could be further from the truth!\nWell, my Dread Lady is somewhat dangerous. I can't deny that. I saw her snap the neck of a mortal, but he did make the mistake of sneezing as he walked past her. She hates such mortal foibles as normal bodily functions. Makes her twitch, from what I've seen. But evil? Who are we to put labels on the moral behavior of beings that are greater than ourselves? I've seen Lyranth bend down to pat a &lt;a href=\"Cat%20%28Online%29\"&gt;kitten&lt;/a&gt; on the head, then watched as she turned and gutted a &lt;a href=\"Dunmer%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Dark Elf&lt;/a&gt; in the street just because the mood struck her. Is that evil? I'll let you decide.\nThe Dread Lady, unlike others of her kind (though in reality, there are no others of her kind), won't necessarily slay a mortal upon first meeting one. She is curious about us, as I've said, and willing to talk. At least until she grows bored with the conversation. I find it best to keep my interactions with her short and to the point. She can be unkind when she becomes bored. She also permits mortals to assist her in her great works from time to time. While so far I have served only as her prophet and messenger, I know for a fact that other mortals have actually adventured with her, both here on &lt;a href=\"Nirn\"&gt;Nirn&lt;/a&gt; and on distant Oblivion planes.\nLyranth also finds amusement in the actions of mortals. She presents herself as aloof and fickle, but I believe that through her interactions with us \"little mortals,\" she has become singular among the beings of Oblivion. And that is why I adore her and bring you her words. But I find her humor to be infectious, even when it cuts me to the bone. I find her observations enlightening, even when they expose my most egregious flaws.\nSome call her an outcast. Others say she is the last of her &lt;a href=\"Foolkillers%20Clan\"&gt;clan&lt;/a&gt;. That she seeks revenge on those who banished or destroyed the clan she belonged to. I am no expert on the clans and cultures of Daedric society, but if someone was responsible for such a tragedy, I pity the fool when the Dread Lady finally gets her hands on them.\nIf you ever are blessed with the Dread Lady's presence, heed my advice: Never ask her why. She finds the mortal need to know the reason for every action to be tiresome at best and insulting at worst. You never want to insult the Dread Lady. Nothing good ever comes of that.\nRogatus Cinna, Prophet of the Dread Lady"}

Regarding your recent request for an expert on &lt;a href=\"Daedric\"&gt;Daedric&lt;/a&gt; matters of a sensitive nature, might I recommend &lt;a href=\"Mirri%20Elendis\"&gt;Mirri Elendis&lt;/a&gt;? Even as a relatively young &lt;a href=\"Dunmer%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Dark Elf&lt;/a&gt;, she has already made a reputation for herself in &lt;a href=\"Mournhold%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Mournhold&lt;/a&gt; and the surrounding countryside. I have no doubt that she could be a help to you in &lt;a href=\"Vivec%20City%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Vivec City&lt;/a&gt; or wherever the &lt;a href=\"Fighters%20Guild%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Fighters Guild&lt;/a&gt; requires assistance.\nMirri comes from a minor Dark Elf family that has a somewhat checkered reputation for recovering ancient relics, especially items tied to Daedra and the &lt;a href=\"Daedric%20Princes\"&gt;Daedric Princes&lt;/a&gt;. Her father was a former &lt;a href=\"House%20Hlaalu%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Hlaalu&lt;/a&gt; merchant who wasn't above trading some of the antiquities they acquired for gold or favors, while her mother was more of a procurer of said curiosities, delving into ruins with audacity and aplomb. I can confirm that Mirri definitely takes after the maternal side of the family.\nMirri\u2019s work for us here in Mournhold has been a blessing, even if the &lt;a href=\"Ordinator%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Ordinator&lt;/a&gt; sometimes look askew at her methods. Not only has she been an asset in our study and subsequent drive to deal with the &lt;a href=\"Dark%20Anchors\"&gt;Dark Anchors&lt;/a&gt; that litter the landscape far and wide, she has also been invaluable when it comes to certain missions we have been charged with by the &lt;a href=\"Tribunal%20Temple%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Tribunal Temple&lt;/a&gt;. I don't know how it is for you in the city of the Living God, &lt;a href=\"Vivec%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Vivec&lt;/a&gt; , but our guildhall's proximity to Mother &lt;a href=\"Almalexia%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Almalexia&lt;/a&gt; encourages her to utilize us as though we were another arm of her Ordinators. It pays well, so who am I to complain?\nLuckily, Mirri holds the Tribunal in high esteem, and though she is nowhere near what any of us would call orthodox, she possesses a driving interest in the Anticipations and how they relate to the Living Gods. So, tracking down relics related to the Anticipations for the Tribunal has solidified her position as a worthy consultant in all matters concerning the Daedra. She isn't a worshiper of the Daedra, if that's your concern. But she analyzes them the way a &lt;a href=\"Kwama%20%28Online%29\"&gt;kwama&lt;/a&gt; miner studies every aspect of the insects they keep and the eggs those creatures lay. As Mirri likes to say, \"You can't fetching deal with an enraged &lt;a href=\"Alit%20%28Online%29\"&gt;alit&lt;/a&gt; unless you know what made it fetching mad in the first place.\" For that reason, she has dedicated herself to knowing all she can about Daedra and Daedric relics.\nNow, I don't want you to get the wrong idea. Mirri is competent and hard-working, but she's in no way easy to deal with. She despises authority figures and constantly skirts along the edge of trouble with the local law. She bends the rules nearly to the breaking point, but she gets things done. When she doesn't get her way, her mood turns darker than the bottom of &lt;a href=\"Malacath\"&gt;Malacath&lt;/a&gt;\u2019s black boot. And the only thing fouler than her mood is her mouth\u2014she curses like a &lt;a href=\"Maormer\"&gt;Sea Elf&lt;/a&gt; pirate! I remember the first time she graced our hall with her presence, Mirri felt that Soris Rothan had insulted her in some way. She unleashed a barrage of profanities upon the poor sod that ended by proclaiming him \"a &lt;a href=\"Scrib%20%28Online%29\"&gt;scrib&lt;/a&gt; sucking s'wit with lips an alit wouldn't kiss!\" We laughed for nearly an hour over that!\nI wouldn't want a guildhall full of , but I wouldn't trade the one I've been using for all the scrib jerky in &lt;a href=\"Morrowind%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Morrowind&lt;/a&gt;. And you know I love my scrib jerky! If you need a Daedric consultant to delve into the ruins and tombs that decorate the &lt;a href=\"Vvardenfell%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Vvardenfell&lt;/a&gt; wilderness, or if you have a mission that requires Daedric expertise in &lt;a href=\"Blackwood%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Blackwood&lt;/a&gt; or anywhere else in &lt;a href=\"Tamriel\"&gt;Tamriel&lt;/a&gt;, you won't find a better hire than Mirri Elendis. On that, you have my word.\nBelderi Llenim, Armsman, Mournhold Guildhall"}

In light of these developments, I have ordered an immediate withdrawal of all remaining legionaries to the &lt;a href=\"Jerall%20Mountains\"&gt;Jerall&lt;/a&gt; crossing to await further orders. I strongly recommend that the Legate delay any additional deployments north of the Jeralls until the coven threat moves farther north.\nInitial reports indicated that the Icereach Coven served the &lt;a href=\"Emperor%20Leovic\"&gt;Reach-Emperor Leovic&lt;/a&gt; as advisors only. Their leader, a witch called &lt;a href=\"Mother%20Ciannait\"&gt;Mother Ciannait&lt;/a&gt;, disproved that belief in horrific fashion.\nDuring our first assault on the coven, we expected only modest resistance. We had harried them for over a week, across the highlands and into the Jerall Mountains in heavy snow. When we descended into Falkreath, we expected an exhausted enemy. What we found was a slaughter.\nMother Ciannait and her coterie of &lt;a href=\"Hag%20%28Online%29\"&gt;hags&lt;/a&gt; had taken refuge among the graves west of the town, summoning hordes of desiccated Nords and empowering them with vile enchantments. Amidst the howling winds and biting sleet we heard Ciannait\u2019s voice boom through the pines\u2014oddly matronly, but also filled with arcane menace. Many legionaries fell under her influence and fled the field, shrieking and tearing at their armor, as if covered in a swarm of stinging insects. Others screamed in pain as the witches heated their metal cuirasses white-hot, like metal drawn from a forge.\nI caught only a fleeting glimpse of her, lit by bursting flames and blasts of lightning. She wore a twisted wicker mask and the elements roared and danced around her like shrieking lunatics. I see her still when I close my eyes.\nI pray the Legate will forgive these florid descriptions. I only mean to express the full effect of what we witnessed so we can exercise all due caution in the future. Should the Legate wish it, I will marshal my remaining legionaries and continue the chase. But I fear Mother Ciannait will make us pay an even higher price if we meet her again. I pray the Legate will allow us to return to &lt;a href=\"Cyrodiil%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Cyrodiil&lt;/a&gt; soon. This matter of the Icereach Coven is better left to the Nords.\nYou can face Mother Ciannait yourself in Icereach, a new dungeon coming soon with the Harrowstorm DLC game pack. Fear her power. Will you be kicking off your Dark Heart of Skyrim adventure with Mother Ciannait and this new challenge? Let us know @TESOnline, Instagram, or Facebook."}

This entry was &lt;a href=\"https%3A//www.elderscrollsonline.com/en-us/news/post/58143\"&gt;published&lt;/a&gt; on 05/05/2020.\nContents.\nTo my liege, &lt;a href=\"Jorunn%20the%20Skald-King\"&gt;Jorunn the Skald-King&lt;/a&gt;,\nForgive my late report. My arrival in &lt;a href=\"Haafingar\"&gt;Haafingar&lt;/a&gt; didn't go unnoticed and I have had to keep a low profile until the guards lost interest. The folk of &lt;a href=\"Solitude%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Solitude&lt;/a&gt; are suspicious of strangers, though I can't say if this is the usual atmosphere or if something has set them on edge. I'm working out of the Lonely Troll inn until I can settle in with the locals and establish my cover. I'd hoped to blend in more easily, but it seems the place mostly caters to the same clientele. During my time at the bar, I found myself among unexpected company.\nA pair of regulars took notice of the new face and solicited my company. I could tell they were looking for a dupe to pay for their drinks, but a few rounds of mead make for a cheap bribe for information. What I learned was that the briefing on the royal family of Solitude was lacking. Despite the rumors of her disappearance or death, I can assure you, &lt;a href=\"Princess%20Svana\"&gt;Princess Svana&lt;/a&gt; is livelier than ever. She was one of those two regulars who wanted free drinks at the bar.\nAt first, I thought it was a fraud conjured up for a gullible stranger\u2014a dangerous one, considering the high king's temperament\u2014but no one else in the establishment even batted an eye when the blustery &lt;a href=\"Orsimer%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Orc&lt;/a&gt; claimed I was in the presence of royalty. It was simply a matter of fact that the young, fiery-haired woman wearing a smug smirk on her face was the daughter of &lt;a href=\"High%20King%20Svargrim\"&gt;High King Svargrim&lt;/a&gt;.\n\"We're the welcoming committee. You're 'welcome' to pay tribute,\" she said as she slid her mug in my direction. \"Just don\u2019t call me princess.\"\nI hadn't planned to make contact with any of the royal family, just lay the groundwork for when &lt;a href=\"Lyris%20Titanborn%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Lyris Titanborn&lt;/a&gt; arrives. But as far as spying goes, this was an opportunity I couldn't let pass. I spent the rest of the evening drinking with Svana and her hanger-on, &lt;a href=\"Maugh\"&gt;Maugh&lt;/a&gt; the Orc, letting them regale me with their antics. I can't vouch for her skills at the Jarl's Waltz, but she can dance on a table with a measure of grace I haven\u2019t seen this far from &lt;a href=\"Morrowind%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Morrowind&lt;/a&gt;. She probably had formal singing lessons at the Bards College, too, though I'm pretty sure Maugh supplied the lyrics.\nIf I hadn\u2019t let half my drinks spill down my chin, I'd never have been able to keep up with the two of them.\nSvana and Maugh were not, in fact, the welcoming committee. Not in any official capacity. Svana has no interest in matters of state or politics, and that hasn\u2019t set well with her family. The princess seems to be estranged from the king and queen, which is why no one has seen her at official functions in years. It would have been too convenient to stumble into a position of confidence with the royal family, but Svana may still prove to be a useful asset. Even if they aren\u2019t speaking, she knows High King Svargrim and &lt;a href=\"Queen%20Gerhyld\"&gt;Queen Gerhyld&lt;/a&gt; better than anyone.\nI need to be careful coaxing information out of her. She doesn't like speaking about her family and it quickly sours her boisterous demeanor. That said, she has a mischievous and rebellious streak that could come in handy if Svargrim refuses to cooperate with us. I believe we can goad her into acting in our interests just to spite her father.\nIf nothing else, Svana and Maugh have a finger on the pulse of Solitude. They\u2019ve already let slip some things about other strangers that my gut tells me I need to look into. Thank Kyne for Svana\u2019s thirst! I\u2019ll be fast on the trail of the Icereach Coven by the time Lyris arrives, your majesty. I won\u2019t make contact again before then.\nFor &lt;a href=\"Skyrim%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Skyrim&lt;/a&gt;!\n&lt;a href=\"Brondold\"&gt;Brondold&lt;/a&gt;"}

I traveled from &lt;a href=\"Rawl%27kha%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Rawl\u2019kha&lt;/a&gt; to &lt;a href=\"Torval\"&gt;Torval&lt;/a&gt;, scouring libraries and harassing moon-singers to learn every tale that related, in some smaller or greater way, to the mythic hero, &lt;a href=\"Khunzar-ri\"&gt;Khunzar-ri&lt;/a&gt;. It is through these stories that I hope to reveal the hidden history of the ancient Dragon and gain insight into his goals and any potential secret shelters he may be utilizing. As my research began to point in the direction of Southern &lt;a href=\"Elsweyr\"&gt;Elsweyr&lt;/a&gt;, news of an old associate reached me through my usual network of spies and contacts. Sai Sahan is alive and well and apparently operating in &lt;a href=\"Pellitine\"&gt;Pellitine&lt;/a&gt;!\nSai Sahan. I haven\u2019t actually thought about the bearded mammoth in quite some time. We were companions once, allies of a sort in service to Emperor &lt;a href=\"Varen%20Aquilarios%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Varen Aquilarios&lt;/a&gt;. That seems like a lifetime ago. When I first met the man, he was already known as an accomplished warrior. The Redguard noble was a master sword fighter who rose to lead the Emperor\u2019s Imperial &lt;a href=\"Dragonguard\"&gt;Dragonguard&lt;/a&gt;. Before that, though? I need to dredge up ancient memories so that I can best determine how to fully utilize Sai Sahan.\nUnyielding and honorable to a fault, Sai Sahan holds duty and dedication above all else. Of course, this leads him to unswervingly serve his betters, which is probably why we got along so well. While he presents a cool and collected exterior to the world at large, the beard that speaks rages beneath the surface, where anger and a barely controlled blood-lust wait to be unleashed. For this reason, the subdued warrior truly comes alive in the heat of battle, where he can set his most destructive urges free. He does have a softer side, however. It becomes evident whenever the half-giant, &lt;a href=\"Lyris%20Titanborn%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Lyris Titanborn&lt;/a&gt;, enters the picture. He calls her his \u201cSnow Lily,\u201d much to my disgust. She does seem to be the beauty that can calm the storm of death that seethes at the &lt;a href=\"Redguard\"&gt;Redguard&lt;/a&gt;\u2019s core.\nSo, where did the silent mountain of excessive muscle come from? He learned the ways of the ancient &lt;a href=\"Yokuda\"&gt;Yokuda&lt;/a&gt;n sword-saints growing up in the &lt;a href=\"Valley%20of%20Blades\"&gt;Valley of Blades&lt;/a&gt;. There, he studied at the feet of his mentor, &lt;a href=\"Kasura\"&gt;Kasura&lt;/a&gt;. He vowed to revive the martial traditions of his ancestors, but his early efforts in this regard failed. Instead, he shaved his head, grew out his massive beard, and became a mercenary. Eventually, he met the Colovian military leader, Varen Aquilarios, serving in the war against the &lt;a href=\"Longhouse%20Emperors\"&gt;Longhouse Emperors&lt;/a&gt;. During the battle to liberate &lt;a href=\"Leyawiin\"&gt;Leyawiin&lt;/a&gt;, his own mercenaries turned on him. Paid off by &lt;a href=\"Emperor%20Leovic\"&gt;Emperor Leovic&lt;/a&gt;, they were charged with delivering the head of the now legendary commander. They failed, obviously, but the story gets kind of outlandish at this point. Supposedly, Sai Sahan cut through the army of traitors as well as Leovic\u2019s defenders, returning to Varen with the scalps of eighty-six enemies and news that Leyawiin was now free.\nNow, as I consider strategies for dealing with Kaalgrontiid and the Dragons raging over Elsweyr, one thing remains clear. I must make the most of every weapon in my arsenal. I see no reason not to reconnect with the beard that walks like a man and make use of his formidable fighting skills. To not do so would be reckless. And besides, I\u2019m almost certain he\u2019s forgotten all about what happened the last time we were together."}

This entry was &lt;a href=\"https%3A//www.elderscrollsonline.com/en-us/news/post/56937\"&gt;published&lt;/a&gt; on 09/04/2019.\nContents.\nFrom the Annals of &lt;a href=\"Vanus%20Galerion%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Vanus Galerion&lt;/a&gt;,\nI am rarely surprised. Where a less developed intellect encounters the unexpected, I find only the improbable. And yet, there have been moments during my tenure as Arch-Mage that remind me not to let my meritorious status go to my head. My encounter with the Changeling, &lt;a href=\"Selene%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Selene&lt;/a&gt;, ranks high among them. It was at a time when the &lt;a href=\"Mages%20Guild%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Mages Guild&lt;/a&gt; was still young, relatively speaking, when my order had finally struck out from the &lt;a href=\"Summerset%20Isles%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Summerset Isles&lt;/a&gt; and began to move into continental &lt;a href=\"Tamriel\"&gt;Tamriel&lt;/a&gt;.\nI petitioned the &lt;a href=\"Silvenar%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Silvenar&lt;/a&gt; to allow us entry into the &lt;a href=\"Bosmer%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Wood Elf&lt;/a&gt; domain. To establish a guildhall within the capitol, no less. To say that &lt;a href=\"Valenwood%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Valenwood&lt;/a&gt; was resistant to any more outside forces meddling in their affairs would be an understatement, but I was granted an opportunity to prove the value of the guild. Our first contract, as it were: explore the uncharted fen east of Silvenar. It was the only part of the Green that the Wood Elves knew little of, because those who entered the quagmire never returned. While it was obvious that the Silvenar meant to be rid of me, this manner of challenge was exactly what I founded the Mages Guild for.\nThe region had acquired the moniker \"the Web,\" both for its overwhelmingly dense vine growth and the belief that those who enter become irrevocably ensnared within. This analogy would prove to be more apt than they could have imagined, for within this morass my expedition became mired in more than mud. I can\u2019t recall how long we spent wading through that lightless forest, but I can tell you now that we never spent a moment of it alone. The eyes of every creature we saw watched us intently, and there wasn\u2019t a sound beyond our own clumsy slogging. It seemed as if everything had stopped to listen to our trespass.\nDespite our best efforts navigating the overgrowth, the expedition became lost and separated at every turn until I found myself groping, alone in the dark. Then the world itself turned upside down after something tugged at my leg, ensnaring it. The blood rushed into my ears. Quickly, I conjured a light to identify what had me and was greeted by the glistening fangs of a spider four times my size a hair\u2019s breadth from my face. I will not record the sound I made for posterity, but I admit that it was undignified. The creature bound my arms before I could conjure a spell in response and leaned in toward my neck, but instead of sinking its fangs into my throat it whispered in my ear.\nSelene, as I came to know her, demanded to know why we intruded on her domain. Clearly, she was displeased by our visitation, but I noted a sense of curiosity behind her menace that I seized upon. This being was obviously as uncertain of what I was as I was of her. There was much about my expedition that she had never seen from the isolation of her woods. Eventually she let me down and took my form, or rather, that of an &lt;a href=\"Altmer%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Altmer&lt;/a&gt; woman sharing my features. I believe she did this as an effort to ease tensions, yet she did not realize how unsettling a gesture it was. Still, we spoke for a long time. From the way Selene spoke of the world, it was apparent that she was a not a being for which time held much meaning.\nThe Wood Elves hold the belief that &lt;a href=\"Mundus\"&gt;Mundus&lt;/a&gt; was a teaming mass of chaos when it was first established, and &lt;a href=\"Y%27ffre\"&gt;Y'ffre&lt;/a&gt; was the first to give order to the world, establishing the laws of nature. Others followed, and &lt;a href=\"Nirn\"&gt;Nirn&lt;/a&gt; took form. I believe that Selene is not far removed from the time when the &lt;a href=\"Ehlnofey\"&gt;Ehlnofey&lt;/a&gt; formed the bones of the earth. In fact, I'll be so bold as to claim that the Changeling was among the earliest creatures on Nirn, and I attribute her formlessness to that. My hypothesis is that she is a remnant of that original chaos taught to control her fluidity. The way that she spoke of her Goddess, Shagrath, leads me to believe that this being was responsible for showing her how to take form. Whether this entity was lost to time or still exists in some form remains a mystery, though I can think of only one being from the birth of the world who possesses an affinity for spiders and that\u2019s concerning.\nI eventually persuaded Selene to release me and my subordinates, whom she had cocooned, under the agreement that we never intrude uninvited again, and that we would bargain on her behalf with the Wood Elves who encroach on her territory. Much can be learned from a creature like Selene, and preserving her habitat and good will is paramount to both. When I returned to the capital, I brought these findings before the Silvenar and &lt;a href=\"Green%20Lady\"&gt;Green Lady&lt;/a&gt;. Both were unsettled by the presence of a Changeling in their forest. A creature that can change its form freely flies in the face of their belief that everything in the Green was given the shape Y\u2019ffre intended, but the possibility that she might well have walked the world alongside the Divine was enough to convince them to respect the boundaries of her domain. So impressed was the Silvenar by my guild\u2019s handling of the situation that he granted me our first charter in Valenwood. I still regard the accord between the Mages Guild, the Elves of the Green, and Selene among the greatest of my successes as Arch-Mage."}

I fault myself in part, but honestly &lt;a href=\"Shelaria\"&gt;Shelaria&lt;/a&gt; bears the lion\u2019s share of the blame. Why do I always listen to her? Is it not enough that I still eat nothing but thin broth and unleavened bread from our last transgression? When will she learn to heed the words of our betters?\nBlademaster &lt;a href=\"Sahmin\"&gt;Sahmin&lt;/a&gt; values secrecy above all things. We all know this. \"The &lt;a href=\"Unhallowed%20Grave%20%28Location%29\"&gt;Unhallowed Grave&lt;/a&gt;'s greatest asset is its obscurity,\" he says. It does not appear on any map. No wheezing drunkards utter its name to listening ears. \"Our shield is secrecy!\" Sahmin cries. Over and over, he growls this admonition: \"Do not travel beyond the canyons!\" And yet, there we were, saddling our jackals and preparing to ride.\n\"We cannot be caught flat-footed, Keroufeh!\" Shelaria hissed. \"If we do not patrol our lands, how are we to know when an enemy approaches?\" It seemed reasonable at the time. Now--with broad red stripes across my back--it seems less so.\nShelaria sees threats everywhere. She barely trusts me, and I count myself as her bosom companion. I tried to tell her that the Grave has gone unnoticed for hundreds of years, but she would hear none of it. She insisted that these were unprecedented times. &lt;a href=\"Dragons%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Dragons&lt;/a&gt; rise in &lt;a href=\"Elsweyr%20%28Online%29\"&gt;the south&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href=\"Dark%20Anchors\"&gt;Chains&lt;/a&gt; fall from the sky. &lt;a href=\"Alliance%20War\"&gt;Alliances&lt;/a&gt; set &lt;a href=\"Cyrodiil%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Cyrodiil&lt;/a&gt; ablaze. \"We must be prepared!\"\nThe two of us rode the ridge near the &lt;a href=\"Bangkorai%20Garrison\"&gt;Bangkorai Garrison&lt;/a&gt;, watching the comings and goings of the &lt;a href=\"Bretons%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Breton&lt;/a&gt; traders beyond, then turned south toward &lt;a href=\"Klathzgar\"&gt;Klathzgar&lt;/a&gt; to observe the toothless, knife-wielding bandits that often stray too close to the Grave's hidden entrance. I must admit, it raised my spirits to feel the sweltering wind on my face, and to smell the spices of &lt;a href=\"Hallin%27s%20Stand\"&gt;Hallin's Stand&lt;/a&gt; drift on the breeze. For a moment, the great weight of our oath fell from my shoulders. I felt free. Not Shelaria though. I gazed at her face, hard as flint, and saw nothing but disquiet--like a hound that catches wind of intruder just beyond sight.\nI\u2019ve not seen her since we received our punishment, but I fear her anxiety has not diminished. I know her fears are baseless. I know the Unhallowed Grave remains safe. Even so, on some dark nights when the lamps burn low, I cannot help but think that maybe Shelaria is right."}

The few cultists we did question were new recruits with little knowledge of the actual workings of the organization. I heard rumors about individuals with ominous titles such as Devastator, Disastrix, or Doombringer, but received very few actual names to pursue. I did finally find one name that prompted further investigation: a woman named &lt;a href=\"Sister%20Celdina\"&gt;Sister Celdina&lt;/a&gt;.\nAs far as I can determine, Sister Celdina is not currently in &lt;a href=\"Blackwood%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Blackwood&lt;/a&gt;. Some other Dagonist is responsible for our current troubles. But she does seem to have authored various testimonies that many Waking Flame recruits have read, and some say that she oversees the training of select novices in a secret citadel \"someplace far away.\" Even more interesting, I found hints that this Sister Celdina was connected to the &lt;a href=\"Longhouse%20Emperors\"&gt;Longhouse Emperors&lt;/a&gt;' court twenty to twenty-five years ago. \nSince that's a little before my time, I asked Councilor Lovidicus whether he recalled anyone by that name in &lt;a href=\"Cyrodiil%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Cyrodiil&lt;/a&gt;. His response:\n\"Sister Celdina? I recall the woman. She came to the &lt;a href=\"White-Gold%20Tower%20%28Online%29\"&gt;White-Gold Tower&lt;/a&gt; sometime around 2E 556 or 557, during &lt;a href=\"Emperor%20Moricar\"&gt;Emperor Moricar&lt;/a&gt;'s reign, and remained in Cyrodiil for about three or four years. She was a &lt;a href=\"Bretons%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Breton&lt;/a&gt; priest, tall, with piercing dark eyes and a rather cold manner. I would describe her as strong and statuesque, with a presence and attitude that commanded one's attention. I will never forget the rather uncanny way Celdina would stare at me until I felt almost compelled to look away.\n\"I never quite nailed down exactly what manner of priest she was or what her purpose was at court. In those days, Emperor Moricar maintained quite a collection of shadowy figures among his advisors\u2014&lt;a href=\"Reachmen%20%28Online%29\"&gt;witchfolk from the Reach&lt;/a&gt;, mystics, charlatans, favor-seekers, influence-peddlers, and more. At times Sister Celdina seemed to be constantly at his side, but she rarely offered him any counsel in front of the rest of the court. At other times she disappeared for months to the gods only know where.\n\"At one point, I hired investigators to see what could be learned about Sister Celdina and how she might be advising Emperor Moricar. They discovered that she was raised in a priory near &lt;a href=\"Stormhaven%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Stormhaven&lt;/a&gt;, taken in by priests of &lt;a href=\"Magnus\"&gt;Magnus&lt;/a&gt; as a young orphan. &lt;a href=\"Durcorach%20the%20Black%20Drake\"&gt;Durcorach's&lt;/a&gt; horde of Reachfolk pillaged the priory in 2E 541, and they carried her and others off into captivity. When she finally resurfaced, many months after the priory's destruction, it was to renounce her vows and resign from her order. She sailed from &lt;a href=\"Daggerfall%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Daggerfall&lt;/a&gt; to &lt;a href=\"Leyawiin%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Leyawiin&lt;/a&gt;, and dropped out of sight around 2E 544. Where Celdina spent the next decade I could not say\u2014she simply turned up one day at the White-Gold Tower and presented herself to Emperor Moricar, who rewarded her with a minor court appointment. Then a few years later, she departed the court just as suddenly as she had appeared. I never saw her again.\n\"Given what we now know about the Longhouse Emperors' secret allegiances and the rise of the Waking Flame cult, I wouldn't be surprised to learn that Sister Celdina served as a priest of Mehrunes Dagon in Moricar's court. It wasn't something that Moricar chose to advertise\u2014that mistake, he left to his son &lt;a href=\"Leovic\"&gt;Leovic&lt;/a&gt;. But I must say I never saw Sister Celdina wearing holy symbol, or heard her speak a prayer in his name.\u201d\nBeyond what Councilor Lovidicus recalls, that\u2019s all I could uncover about Sister Celdina. I wish I had better news to report. Wherever this Sister Celdina is, she\u2019s out of our reach for now. If she turns up in Leyawiin, we\u2019ll make capturing her our top priority. But in the meantime, we still have a mysterious High Priest to deal with and Waking Flame sympathizers watching our every move.\nYour faithful servant,\nCaptain Rian Liore\nThe Ivory Brigade of Leyawiin"}

This entry was &lt;a href=\"https%3A//www.elderscrollsonline.com/en-us/news/post/61105\"&gt;published&lt;/a&gt; on 10/19/2021.\nContents.\nBy Nathyn Farandas, Chief of Security to the Saraathu Tong\nMaintaining a safe and profitable presence in &lt;a href=\"Fargrave\"&gt;Fargrave&lt;/a&gt; requires constant vigilance. New arrivals alter the power dynamics of this meeting place of the planes. Sometimes these newcomers try to bend Fargrave to their will\u2014for example, those lunatics from the &lt;a href=\"Waking%20Flame\"&gt;Waking Flame&lt;/a&gt; cult. But sometimes a single individual arrives who fails to recognize how their actions affect the delicate balance of power here.\nTake, for example, the mysterious mortal known only as &lt;a href=\"The%20Anchorite\"&gt;the Anchorite&lt;/a&gt;.\nShe appeared in the Bazaar a short time ago, just another anonymous adventurer seemingly disoriented by her arrival in the city. Most such travelers blunder through another portal soon enough and are never seen again, but she stayed in Fargrave. And soon we began to hear tales of a masked mortal helping anyone in need. Madam Whim herself named her the Anchorite. If she has another name, I could not uncover it.\nWhen it became clear that this mortal\u2019s efforts could complicate &lt;a href=\"Saraathu%20Tong\"&gt;Saraathu Tong&lt;/a&gt; affairs, I set out to find her and take her measure. If she could be bought, we would buy her. If she refused such an offer, then we might at least aim her in directions that would not impinge upon our interests.\nI expected a long and difficult search and set out to ask the people she'd reportedly helped where I might find her. To my surprise, the Anchorite found me. I turned a corner in the court by the four fountains and she was leaning against a wall, waiting for me. Beneath her hood I saw the white-enameled mask that covered the top half of her face.\n\"I heard the Saraathu Tong wants to talk to me,\" she said. \"Why?\"\n\"You are the Anchorite?\" I asked. Apparently, the people I'd spoken to had warned her about me.\n\"That\u2019s what they call me,\" she answered. \"Now, what do you want?\"\n\"Nothing more than a conversation,\" I said, spreading my hands. I had not heard that the Anchorite wielded any great skill with blade or staff. But she'd humiliated Errant bullies on several occasions with a mix of quick wits, stealth, agility, and some basic magical training\u2014a streetwise scrapper, dangerous enough on her chosen ground.\nThe Anchorite merely waited for me to say more, so I did. \"You've been making people nervous,\" I told her. \"Among other things, you embarrassed the Errants, you plucked foolish travelers out of the Invisible Web's strands, and you troubled the Grasp. When you upset the balance of Fargrave, the balance pushes back.\"\n\"I help people,\" she replied. \"Thugs in this place feel they can rob people just because they're weak. Merchants stride past beggars who want only a crust of bread and a chance to earn a living. &lt;a href=\"Daedra%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Daedra&lt;/a&gt; trap innocent mortal travelers in bargains that cost them their souls. I don\u2019t like bullies, so I do something about it.\"\n\"For what profit?\" I asked.\n\"Profit? You sound like Madam Whim. I do it because someone should.\" The Anchorite fixed her masked gaze on me\u2014a rather uncanny feeling\u2014and reached out to poke a finger into my chest. \"\"You\" should. I'm only one person. The Saraathu Tong have gold and power in Fargrave. How much better would this place be if you used your position for good?\"\n\"For free?\" I asked. \"That's a poor approach to business.\"\n\"A less cruel and less dangerous Fargrave might be a better place for the Saraathu Tong to conduct their business. You might even consider it an investment.\"\nI smiled at that. \"You are being na\u00efve, my lady. Sooner or later, you will annoy the wrong Daedra or push a mortal gang too far. They will hurt the people you hope to protect.\"\n\"If they try,\" the Anchorite said, \"then I'll stop them.\"\nShe turned and walked off without another word. I started after her, but a door opened and a whole roomful of drunken House Hexos laborers spilled out into the street between us. Before I could thread my way through the crowd, the Anchorite was gone.\nThis concludes my report. The Anchorite poses no immediate threat to the interests of the Saraathu Tong. However, I expect her continued actions on behalf of Fargrave's less fortunate will eventually shake the very foundations of the Celestial Palanquin. And, I admit, she has gotten me thinking about how we might turn at least some of our efforts toward the common good. I cannot decide which of us is being foolish.\nThe Anchorite is na\u00efve, yes, but also fearless and determined. People like that shape worlds."}

Ever watchful. Ever wary. Like the descendants of &lt;a href=\"Svartr\"&gt;Svartr&lt;/a&gt; who came before him, Svargrim is a king beset by enemies on all sides. Yet none of his noble line have faced such daunting odds during their reigns as our noble Wolf of Solitude.\nNot two years into his reign, &lt;a href=\"Kruntharth%20the%20Sea%20Giant\"&gt;Kruntharth the Sea Giant&lt;/a&gt;'s armada sailed from regions unknown toward our unspoiled shores, no doubt seeking to pillage our prosperous kingdom. Some would-be kings might have cowered behind their high walls while those monsters despoiled the countryside, but not the Wolf! He sailed a fleet of our bravest warriors out to drive the foul &lt;a href=\"Giant%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Giants&lt;/a&gt; back from whence they came or to send them to the unforgiving depths.\nIt\u2019s said that Svargrim stood eye-to-eye with Kruntharth from atop the high mast as the monstrous warrior demanded tribute of our king and kingdom for his mercy. But did our high king yield? Nay! He leapt from the crow's nest and tore open the throat of that Giant like a &lt;a href=\"Wolf%20%28Online%29\"&gt;wolf&lt;/a&gt; preying upon a &lt;a href=\"Mammoth%20%28Online%29\"&gt;mammoth&lt;/a&gt;. So inspired were Svargrim\u2019s soldiers that they followed suit, swinging onto the deck of Kruntharth\u2019s floating fortress and casting the giants into the sea!\nLet us not forget the &lt;a href=\"Great%20Troll%20Rut\"&gt;Great Troll Rut&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"2E%20565\"&gt;2E 565&lt;/a&gt; (as if it were even possible), when the unseasonable warmth inspired broods of the creatures to rampage across the &lt;a href=\"Western%20Skyrim\"&gt;western holds&lt;/a&gt; while locked in unspeakably horrid acts. The Wolf split up twenty of the unholy couplings himself, and further divided those forty creatures with his sword! To this day, &lt;a href=\"Troll%20%28Online%29\"&gt;trolls&lt;/a&gt; tend to avoid the area closest to the walls of Solitude the way chubloons avoid &lt;a href=\"Sabre%20Cat%20%28Online%29\"&gt;sabre cat&lt;/a&gt; dens.\nYou can be certain that when the &lt;a href=\"Akaviri\"&gt;Akaviri&lt;/a&gt; came to &lt;a href=\"Skyrim%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Skyrim&lt;/a&gt; searching for conquest, they took one look at our fearsome king on our palisades and sailed straight east for easier prey. And though they were brought low by the machinations of &lt;a href=\"Dunmer%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Dark Elves&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Argonians%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Mud Lizards&lt;/a&gt;, and the so-called &lt;a href=\"Jorunn%20the%20Skald-King\"&gt;Skald Prince&lt;/a&gt;\u2014who diminishes our noble craft by mere association\u2014they made short work of &lt;a href=\"Windhelm%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Windhelm&lt;/a&gt; and the falsely crowned High Queen of the East, &lt;a href=\"Mabjaarn%20Flame-Hair\"&gt;Mabjaarn Flame-Hair&lt;/a&gt;.\nIf only &lt;a href=\"Emperor\"&gt;Emperor&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Moricar\"&gt;Moricar the Middling&lt;/a&gt; had taken heed before committing his &lt;a href=\"Imperial%20Legion%20%28Online%29\"&gt;legions&lt;/a&gt; to our borders in a vain attempt to subjugate Skyrim from his cushioned seat on the &lt;a href=\"Ruby%20Throne\"&gt;Ruby Throne&lt;/a&gt;. Though his cowardice spared him the same embarrassing death as his predecessor, the howls of the Wolf routing his army in single battle no doubt carried all the way to the &lt;a href=\"White-Gold%20Tower%20%28Online%29\"&gt;White-Gold Tower&lt;/a&gt; and haunted his dreams to the end of his days!\nAnd who was it that saved the western holds from the &lt;a href=\"Reachmen%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Witchman&lt;/a&gt; throng stampeding out from &lt;a href=\"Cyrodiil%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Cyrodiil&lt;/a&gt; after the &lt;a href=\"Longhouse%20Emperors\"&gt;Longhouse Emperors&lt;/a&gt; finally fell? Thousands of those mongrels came clawing and biting into our lands like cornered, rabid dogs, but our noble Wolf strode out and showed them whose fangs were sharpest. When have you seen more than a handful of Reachfolk in our lands since?\nTake heart, &lt;a href=\"Nords%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Nords&lt;/a&gt; of the West. Though troubles assail us from east and west, south and north, you have nothing to fear from that motley &lt;a href=\"Ebonheart%20Pact\"&gt;pact&lt;/a&gt; of Elves, lizards, and iceheels, or the unwashed hordes of the Despot of &lt;a href=\"Markarth\"&gt;Markarth&lt;/a&gt;. The Wolf of Solitude keeps a tireless vigil atop his tower. Our enemies will find no safe haven in our wondrous realm."}

However, after speaking with members of the Temple it is revealed that Mehra has not been seen since she last went to her office. Yet, once the Nerevarine has forced their way into her office, they discover that the only evidence that Milo has been in the room is a &lt;a href=\"Note%20to%20Amaya\"&gt;note&lt;/a&gt; with the code word Amaya. The note reveals that she has been taken to the Ministry of Truth and that the Nerevarine may be able to rescue her, requiring two &lt;a href=\"Divine%20Intervention%20%28Morrowind%29\"&gt;Divine Intervention&lt;/a&gt; scrolls and a method of &lt;a href=\"Levitate%20%28Morrowind%29\"&gt;levitation&lt;/a&gt;.

The Nerevarine must levitate up to it in order to gain access to its cells. On the ledges of the Ministry, the Nerevarine may speak to &lt;a href=\"Alvela%20Saram\"&gt;Alvela Saram&lt;/a&gt;, a guard who is in league with Milo. She will give the Nerevarine a key to gain entrance into the Ministry, although she also warns that the Nerevarine will be attacked on site, and that the inside doors each have separate keys.\nMilo can be found within the rightmost cell within the Prison Keep at the top of the Ministry. The Prison Keep is guarded by many &lt;a href=\"Ordinator%20%28Morrowind%29\"&gt;Ordinators&lt;/a&gt;, all of whom will attack the Nerevarine on sight. If the Hero is not a beast race, has a rank of adept or above in the &lt;a href=\"Tribunal%20Temple\"&gt;Tribunal Temple&lt;/a&gt;, and is wearing the &lt;a href=\"Indoril%20Armor\"&gt;Indoril&lt;/a&gt; helmet, cuirass, and pauldrons, they can speak to the &lt;a href=\"Grand%20Inquisitor%20%28Morrowind%29\"&gt;Grand Inquisitor&lt;/a&gt;, provided his &lt;a href=\"Personality%20%28Morrowind%29\"&gt;disposition&lt;/a&gt; is above 70, and talk about \"proper authorization.\" If not, the Nerevarine must be prepared to defend themselves against the Ordinators and, once entering the prison keep, they will be branded an outlaw who Milo wants nothing to do with until they redeem themself.\nOnce Milo's cell has been reached, she will ask for the Divine Intervention Scroll to fulfill her plan to escape. She then agrees to meet with the Nerevarine at &lt;a href=\"Holamayan\"&gt;Holamayan&lt;/a&gt; once they have escaped. She gives advice and a password to reach the &lt;a href=\"Holamayan%20Monastery%20%28Morrowind%29\"&gt;Holamayan Monastery&lt;/a&gt;. Milo will then use the Divine Intervention Scroll to escape, leaving the Nerevarine to do the same.\nHolamayan.\nHaving made their escape, the Hero must go to &lt;a href=\"Ebonheart%20%28Morrowind%29\"&gt;Ebonheart&lt;/a&gt;. Once there, the Nerevarine will speak with &lt;a href=\"Blatta%20Hateria\"&gt;Blatta Hateria&lt;/a&gt; in the East Docks, who will ask the Nerevarine if she \"knows you.\" The Nerevarine uses the password given by Milo, and ask if Hateria would \"go fishing?\". She then provides the means to travel to Holamayan.\nHolamayan itself is a hidden monastery that houses the &lt;a href=\"Dissident%20Priests\"&gt;Dissident Priests&lt;/a&gt;. The monastery, however, cannot be entered at any other time than Dawn or Dusk. The rock that blocks the entrance only opens from 6 AM to 8 AM or 6 PM to 8 PM. Once the Nerevarine enters Holamayan they can speak with &lt;a href=\"Gilvas%20Barelo\"&gt;Gilvas Barelo&lt;/a&gt; about the lost prophecies. He will give the Nerevarine three papers: &lt;a href=\"Kagrenac%27s%20Tools\"&gt;Kagrenac's Tools&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"The%20Lost%20Prophecy\"&gt;The Lost Prophecy&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"The%20Seven%20Curses\"&gt;The Seven Curses&lt;/a&gt;, and informs the Nerevarine more about the prophecies about the Nerevarine.\nThe Nerevarine may then travel to the &lt;a href=\"Urshilaku%20Camp%20%28Morrowind%29\"&gt;Urshilaku Camp&lt;/a&gt; in the north of Vvardenfell and speak with Nibani Maesa."}

The &lt;a href=\"Dark%20Brotherhood\"&gt;Dark Brotherhood&lt;/a&gt; has coveted the powerful artifact for generations and the decimation of its ranks during a vicious power struggle is believed to have involved the Razor.\nDespite this statement by the renowned specialist the bloody trace of Mehrunes' Razor may be followed over the centuries. One of the earliest sources hints that it may have been in the possession of &lt;a href=\"Master%20Neloth\"&gt;Master Neloth&lt;/a&gt; for a while. Neloth, a powerful &lt;a href=\"Mage%20%28Class%29\"&gt;mage&lt;/a&gt; and Councilor of &lt;a href=\"House%20Telvanni\"&gt;House Telvanni&lt;/a&gt; on &lt;a href=\"Vvardenfell\"&gt;Vvardenfell&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Morrowind\"&gt;Morrowind&lt;/a&gt;, used the dagger to improve the performance of his otherwise cowardly troops in a conflict with &lt;a href=\"Master%20Gothren\"&gt;Master Gothren&lt;/a&gt;, another Telvanni Councilor. According to the source, he lost the dagger to a group of gifted &lt;a href=\"acrobat\"&gt;acrobat&lt;/a&gt;s. It is not known whether the thieves ever returned the weapon to its former bearer.\nAt the close of the &lt;a href=\"Third%20Era\"&gt;Third Era&lt;/a&gt; Mehrunes' Razor lay rusted and forgotten inside &lt;a href=\"Alas%20Ancestral%20Tomb\"&gt;Alas Ancestral Tomb&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;a href=\"Molag%20Mar%20%28Morrowind%29\"&gt;Molag Mar&lt;/a&gt; region on Vvardenfell. According to Mehrunes Dagon himself an unworthy bearer, possibly one of the above-mentioned acrobats, had been in possession of the artifact prior to his or her death. An unnamed hero said to have been the &lt;a href=\"Nerevarine\"&gt;Nerevarine&lt;/a&gt; won Mehrunes' Razor by retrieving it from the depths of the tomb and having it returned to its former glory by the Daedric Prince himself.\nThe next trace occurs only a few years later in eastern &lt;a href=\"Cyrodiil\"&gt;Cyrodiil&lt;/a&gt;. The Telvanni mage &lt;a href=\"Frathen%20Drothan\"&gt;Frathen Drothan&lt;/a&gt; has gathered the &lt;a href=\"Drothmeri%20Army\"&gt;Drothmeri Army&lt;/a&gt; and headed towards the ancient &lt;a href=\"Ayleid\"&gt;Ayleid&lt;/a&gt; city &lt;a href=\"Varsa%20Baalim\"&gt;Varsa Baalim&lt;/a&gt; where he believed Mehrunes' Razor was to be found. He planned to retrieve the epic artifact and use it to free Morrowind and its &lt;a href=\"Dunmer\"&gt;Dunmer&lt;/a&gt; people from the reign of the Empire. His plans were frustrated by the &lt;a href=\"Hero%20of%20Kvatch\"&gt;Hero of Kvatch&lt;/a&gt;, however, who entered the &lt;a href=\"Ayleid%20Ruins\"&gt;ruin&lt;/a&gt; to claim the weapon for themselves.\nThe Ayleid city of Varsa Baalim itself was according to scholars built around the so-called Nefarivigum, a construct erected by Mehrunes Dagon in order single out worthy pilgrims to whom he would award his artifact. The labyrinthine city of Varsa Baalim should protect the Nefarivigum and hinder any adventurer who seeks the dangerous weapon for themselves.\n&lt;a href=\"Fourth%20Era\"&gt;Fourth Era&lt;/a&gt;.\nAbout two centuries later the Razor has shattered into pieces and in the possession of three different people within &lt;a href=\"Skyrim\"&gt;Skyrim&lt;/a&gt;. The &lt;a href=\"Last%20Dragonborn\"&gt;Last Dragonborn&lt;/a&gt; was sent by the &lt;a href=\"Mythic%20Dawn\"&gt;Mythic Dawn&lt;/a&gt; devotee &lt;a href=\"Silus%20Vesuius\"&gt;Silus Vesuius&lt;/a&gt; to retrieve the pieces from the &lt;a href=\"Nord\"&gt;Nord&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Jorgen\"&gt;Jorgen&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Morthal%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Morthal&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"Hagraven%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Hagraven&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Drascua\"&gt;Drascua&lt;/a&gt; at &lt;a href=\"Dead%20Crone%20Rock\"&gt;Dead Crone Rock&lt;/a&gt;, and the &lt;a href=\"Orsimer\"&gt;Orsimer&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Ghunzul\"&gt;Ghunzul&lt;/a&gt; inside &lt;a href=\"Cracked%20Tusk%20Keep\"&gt;Cracked Tusk Keep&lt;/a&gt;. After gathering the remnants of the mighty blade the Last Dragonborn offered them to the Daedric Prince Mehrunes Dagon. They were faced with the choice to either kill Silus Vesuius in return for the restoration of the blade or to spare his purchaser's life and thus abandon the chance to wield the Razor. It is unknown whether the hero claimed the weapon by killing the innocent or whether the pieces of Mehrunes' Razor still await the day of their reunion.\nPowers.\nMehrunes' Razor has the power to slay an enemy with only one blow. Its chances to do so are around 1.98%. It is said that Mehrunes Dagon himself can claim the souls of those it strikes."}

Mehrunes Dagon is the foe of all mortal &lt;a href=\"races\"&gt;races&lt;/a&gt;, and has attempted to conquer the physical world &lt;a href=\"Nirn\"&gt;Nirn&lt;/a&gt; many times. Some of Mehrunes Dagon's cultists claim that the reason behind his many plots to conquer Nirn is the belief that &lt;a href=\"Tamriel\"&gt;Tamriel&lt;/a&gt; is in fact a plane of Oblivion which is rightly his. This statement however, was not made by Mehrunes Dagon himself, and is thought to be based off of the false assertion that Mundus and Oblivion are not distinct from one another.. Regardless of the reason for his invasions, he invaded Tamriel relentlessly from the First Era onward.\nThe most famous of Dagon's invasions of &lt;a href=\"Morrowind\"&gt;Morrowind&lt;/a&gt; is certainly the attack on the capital city of &lt;a href=\"Mournhold\"&gt;Mournhold&lt;/a&gt; at the end of the &lt;a href=\"First%20Era\"&gt;First Era&lt;/a&gt;. Dagon was defeated by the &lt;a href=\"god\"&gt;god&lt;/a&gt;-like &lt;a href=\"Almalexia\"&gt;Almalexia&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Sotha%20Sil\"&gt;Sotha Sil&lt;/a&gt;, but not before he destroyed the entire city and devoured its populace. Mehrunes Dagon was also behind the destruction of Ald Sotha, where he destroyed &lt;a href=\"House%20Sotha\"&gt;House Sotha&lt;/a&gt;. Some time in the early &lt;a href=\"Third%20Era\"&gt;Third Era&lt;/a&gt;, Mehrunes Dagon was defeated by the sorcerer &lt;a href=\"Chimere%20Graegyn\"&gt;Chimere Graegyn&lt;/a&gt;. Dagon cursed Chimere by twisting the terms of a pact between the two. During the &lt;a href=\"Imperial%20Simulacrum\"&gt;Imperial Simulacrum&lt;/a&gt;, in the years &lt;a href=\"3E%20389\"&gt;3E 389&lt;/a&gt;-&lt;a href=\"3E%20399\"&gt;3E 399&lt;/a&gt;, Lord Dagon conspired with &lt;a href=\"Uriel%20Septim%20VII\"&gt;Uriel Septim VII&lt;/a&gt;'s power-hungry &lt;a href=\"Imperial%20Battlemage\"&gt;Battlemage&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Jagar%20Tharn\"&gt;Jagar Tharn&lt;/a&gt; to imprison the Emperor in Dagon's plane of Oblivion while Tharn assumed the Emperor's likeness and ruled in his place. Further, Dagon assisted Tharn by attacking the &lt;a href=\"Imperial%20Battle%20College\"&gt;Imperial Battle College&lt;/a&gt; in the Battlespire.\nThis attempt at taking over Tamriel was stopped by a mere mortal. Brooding over his many defeats, Dagon eventually came up with his next attempt to conquer Tamriel. This attempt was to become known as the &lt;a href=\"Oblivion%20Crisis\"&gt;Oblivion Crisis&lt;/a&gt;. He had his Mythic Dawn cultists assassinate the &lt;a href=\"Emperor\"&gt;Emperor&lt;/a&gt; and all of his heirs, but one was &lt;a href=\"Martin%20Septim\"&gt;unknown&lt;/a&gt;, and survived. The heir, the &lt;a href=\"Blades\"&gt;Blades&lt;/a&gt;, and the &lt;a href=\"Hero%20of%20Kvatch\"&gt;Hero of Kvatch&lt;/a&gt; continually defeated him until the assault on the &lt;a href=\"Imperial%20City\"&gt;Imperial City&lt;/a&gt;, where Dagon was defeated and banished back to Oblivion by &lt;a href=\"Akatosh\"&gt;Akatosh&lt;/a&gt; himself.\nPlane of Oblivion.\nMehrunes Dagon's &lt;a href=\"plane%20of%20Oblivion\"&gt;plane of Oblivion&lt;/a&gt; is the &lt;a href=\"Deadlands\"&gt;Deadlands&lt;/a&gt;. It appears as a collection of collapsed towers with broken bridges on islands surrounded by lava. Pouches of flesh spawn from an unknown source around the Plane, and are capable of holding equipment. It has several towers that were used to house &lt;a href=\"Sigil%20Stone%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;Sigil Stones&lt;/a&gt; during the &lt;a href=\"Oblivion%20Crisis\"&gt;Oblivion Crisis&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe Invasion of Morrowind.\nLord Sotha Sil &lt;a href=\"Coldharbour%20Compact\"&gt;visited&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Coldharbour\"&gt;Coldharbour&lt;/a&gt;, following the destruction of the city of &lt;a href=\"Gilverdale\"&gt;Gilverdale&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Valenwood\"&gt;Valenwood&lt;/a&gt; by &lt;a href=\"Molag%20Bal\"&gt;Molag Bal&lt;/a&gt;. He made a deal with eight of the more prominent &lt;a href=\"Daedric%20Princes\"&gt;Daedric Princes&lt;/a&gt;: &lt;a href=\"Azura\"&gt;Azura&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Boethiah\"&gt;Boethiah&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Hermaeus%20Mora\"&gt;Hermaeus Mora&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Hircine\"&gt;Hircine&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Malacath\"&gt;Malacath&lt;/a&gt;, Mehrunes Dagon, Molag Bal, and &lt;a href=\"Sheogorath\"&gt;Sheogorath&lt;/a&gt;. The terms of the deal were that during the war between &lt;a href=\"Morrowind\"&gt;Morrowind&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Cyrodiil\"&gt;Cyrodiil&lt;/a&gt;, the Daedric Princes should not accept any summon by a mortal, unless it was done by witches or sorcerers.\nHowever, a former spymaster of Vivec managed to summon Mehrunes Dagon by fueling the rage of a witch of the &lt;a href=\"Skeffington%20Coven\"&gt;Skeffington Coven&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"High%20Rock\"&gt;High Rock&lt;/a&gt;. The witch wanted to take revenge upon the Duke of Morrowind, while the spymaster just wanted to see Morrowind suffer after what Vivec had done to him. Mehrunes Dagon went further and destroyed &lt;a href=\"Mournhold\"&gt;Mournhold&lt;/a&gt;, the capital of Morrowind, in one of the most devastating attacks ever recorded by historians. Although Mehrunes Dagon was eventually banished back to Oblivion by a joint effort of Almalexia and Sotha Sil, Mournhold had been totally destroyed, and the Duke of Morrowind was slain. A new city was constructed right atop the ruins of the destroyed Mournhold.\nAlso in Morrowind, Dagon was responsible for the destruction of &lt;a href=\"Ald%20Sotha\"&gt;Ald Sotha&lt;/a&gt;, ancient home of the Dunmer House Sotha and reported birthplace of Sotha Sil. It is also likely here that the Forces of Destruction were somehow involved.\nImperial Simulacrum.\nDuring the &lt;a href=\"Imperial%20Simulacrum\"&gt;Imperial Simulacrum&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Jagar%20Tharn\"&gt;Jagar Tharn&lt;/a&gt; dealt with Mehrunes Dagon, and it is rumored that Molag Bal assisted in some way, although he did not help in the following events.\nAssault on Battlespire.\nAfter the Miracle of Peace, when the great &lt;a href=\"Numidium\"&gt;Numidium&lt;/a&gt; was resurrected and destroyed once again, Mehrunes Dagon attempted to invade Tamriel, beginning with the Battlespire, where Imperial Battlemages would undergo their final test before graduating. An unnamed apprentice teleported to the floating fort for his final test, only to find himself in the middle of the Daedric invasion. Through purging the levels and traveling to the Oblivion planes, the apprentice frustrated Mehrunes Dagon's ambitions.\nMehrunes Dagon assaulted the &lt;a href=\"Battlespire\"&gt;Battlespire&lt;/a&gt;, a proving ground and bastion of the &lt;a href=\"Imperial%20Battlemage\"&gt;Imperial Battlemage&lt;/a&gt;s. Tharn had to destroy the Imperial Battlemages to solidify his rule over Tamriel in &lt;a href=\"Uriel%20Septim%20VII\"&gt;Uriel Septim VII&lt;/a&gt;'s seat. However, the Prince of Destruction had a hidden agenda: he wanted to invade Tamriel. Since the Prince and his Daedric army could not cross into Tamriel directly, he conquered and used multiple pocket dimensions and the Battlespire, which was the final gateway, as steps to the mortal realm. One of the invaded realms was the &lt;a href=\"Shade%20Perilous\"&gt;Shade Perilous&lt;/a&gt;, a realm of the Daedric Prince &lt;a href=\"Nocturnal\"&gt;Nocturnal&lt;/a&gt;. Two of Nocturnal's lieutenants, &lt;a href=\"Deyanira%20Katrece\"&gt;Deyanira Katrece&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Jaciel%20Morgen\"&gt;Jaciel Morgen&lt;/a&gt;, suffered severely due to Mehrunes Dagon's invasion.\nAlthough the Battlespire had fallen, an unnamed apprentice managed to banish Mehrunes Dagon to Oblivion. The hero used Mehrunes Dagon's protonymic and neonymic, and then struck the Prince with the Daedric Broadsword of the Moon Reiver, an artifact of great power that was forged from Mehrunes Dagon's own essence. With this action, Mehrunes Dagon's anchor to the mortal realm was severed and he was banished to Oblivion. The Battlespire itself was destroyed in the wake of the invasion, due to the fact that the magicka anchors that supported the floating citadel were also severed.\nAnother artifact worthy of note in this period of chaos was the Daedric Crescent Blade. These Blades were used in the invasion of the Battlespire by Mehrunes Dagon's army. After the event, the Septim Dynasty declared this weapon illegal, and thus made the blade highly prized among collectors.\nOblivion Crisis.\nIn the last years of the Third Era of Tamriel, Mehrunes Dagon formed an alliance with the &lt;a href=\"Altmer\"&gt;Altmer&lt;/a&gt; wizard &lt;a href=\"Mankar%20Camoran%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;Mankar Camoran&lt;/a&gt;. Dagon presented Camoran with his book of razors, the Mysterium Xarxes, the principles of which Camoran used to found the Order of the &lt;a href=\"Mythic%20Dawn\"&gt;Mythic Dawn&lt;/a&gt;, a Daedric cult devoted to the destruction of the &lt;a href=\"Septim%20bloodline\"&gt;Septim bloodline&lt;/a&gt; and the re-creation of the Mythic Era in which they believed Dagon would rule.\nThe most infamous and far-reaching show of power from the Daedric Forces of Destruction occurred during the Oblivion Crisis, where Mehrunes Dagon sought to conquer all of Tamriel. In order for Dagon's Forces to invade, however, the Emperor and his heirs had to be removed. This task fell to the Mythic Dawn, who succeeded in assassinating Emperor &lt;a href=\"Uriel%20Septim%20VII\"&gt;Uriel Septim VII&lt;/a&gt;. This extinguished the divine &lt;a href=\"Dragonfires\"&gt;Dragonfires&lt;/a&gt; and allowed Gates to Oblivion to be opened all across &lt;a href=\"Tamriel\"&gt;Tamriel&lt;/a&gt;. The first attack made by the &lt;a href=\"Daedra\"&gt;Daedra&lt;/a&gt; was on the city of &lt;a href=\"Kvatch\"&gt;Kvatch&lt;/a&gt;, which was utterly razed. Following the &lt;a href=\"Battle%20of%20Kvatch\"&gt;Battle of Kvatch&lt;/a&gt;, Oblivion Gates were opened in earnest by the Mythic Dawn, allowing the Daedra to roam the countryside while the main army focused on attacking the major cities.\nThis invasion was to be foiled by the combined efforts of the last surviving heir to the throne, &lt;a href=\"Martin%20Septim\"&gt;Martin Septim&lt;/a&gt;, and the anonymous &lt;a href=\"Hero%20of%20Kvatch\"&gt;Hero of Kvatch&lt;/a&gt;. Time and again, the Hero took the battle into Oblivion itself, fighting off the Daedric Forces of Destruction and retrieving the Sigil Stone that anchored the gate to Tamriel, thus closing the portal. After the Hero led the combined forces of Cyrodiil to a famous victory at the city of &lt;a href=\"Bruma\"&gt;Bruma&lt;/a&gt;, as well as the fall of the Mythic Dawn during the Hero's raid on the cult leader Mankar Camoran's realm of Gaiar Alata, the Daedra launched a final all-out assault on the &lt;a href=\"Imperial%20City\"&gt;Imperial City&lt;/a&gt; itself.\nIt was here that Dagon himself entered the battle, in an attempt to stop Martin Septim re-lighting the Dragonfires. But it was to no avail. Using the power within the &lt;a href=\"Amulet%20of%20Kings\"&gt;Amulet of Kings&lt;/a&gt;, Martin summoned and merged with Akatosh and banished Dagon back into Oblivion, and with him the whole of the Daedric Forces of Destruction.\nThis act, however, consumed both Martin himself and the Amulet of Kings, but apparently rendered the Dragonfires and the Septim Bloodline redundant, leaving Tamriel without the need of the institution of the Empire. Presumably, Akatosh's direct intervention, infused with the life-force of a living Septim, secured the wards that kept Oblivion separate from Nirn to the Divine realm rather than the mundane.\nIn the southern regions of Cyrodiil, deep within a long-forgotten Ayleid ruin, lay the Nefarivigum, a foul construct of Mehrunes Dagon, that was erected to be ever watchful for the pilgrim who would step forth and best an unknown trial of worth. It was said that such a pilgrim would be rewarded with the blessing of &lt;a href=\"Mehrunes%27%20Razor\"&gt;Mehrunes' Razor&lt;/a&gt;. It seems that the construct was able to retrieve the razor from its current owner, and pass it to the pilgrim that solved and survived the trial.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Ayleid\"&gt;Ayleid&lt;/a&gt;s tried to prevent the blade from being released, erecting &lt;a href=\"Varsa%20Baalim\"&gt;Varsa Baalim&lt;/a&gt;, a city that surrounded the &lt;a href=\"Nefarivigum\"&gt;Nefarivigum&lt;/a&gt;. For many years the city stood strong; however, some unfortunate events occurred, and the city was destroyed and lost from the annals of history. Sometime during the Oblivion Crisis, &lt;a href=\"Frathen%20Drothan\"&gt;Frathen Drothan&lt;/a&gt;, a rogue Telvanni mage, tried to retrieve the blade in order to support his rebellion against the Septim Empire. He found the ruins of Varsa Baalim, and eventually he reached the Nefarivigum. However, the Hero of Kvatch thwarted Drothan's nefarious plans and retrieved the blade for themselves.\nAppearance and roles in Tamriel.\nWhen in the mortal realm, Mehrunes Dagon appeared as a gigantic demonic creature with red skin, yellow eyes and four arms, each one armed with a deadly weapon, one such arm had metal claws protruding from its fist. Six horns adorned Dagon's bald skull and his pointed ears were pierced with large gold hoops. His entire body was scarred and tattooed with ritualistic markings. Sharp fangs lined his jaw, and he wore an armored neck brace around his shoulders. His hands and feet were clawed and he frequently used them in battle to stomp on and crush his enemies.\nMehrunes Dagon was also one of the Dunmeri Four Corners of the House of Troubles. The Four Corners of the House of Trouble consisted of Molag Bal, Mehrunes Dagon, Malacath, and Sheogorath. These Daedric Princes rebelled against the counsel and admonition of the &lt;a href=\"Tribunal\"&gt;Tribunal&lt;/a&gt;, causing great strife among their Daedric kin and confusion among the clans and &lt;a href=\"Great%20Houses\"&gt;Great Houses&lt;/a&gt; of Morrowind. They are holy in that they serve the role of obstacles during the Testing. Through time they have sometimes become associated with local enemies, like the &lt;a href=\"Nords\"&gt;Nords&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Akaviri\"&gt;Akaviri&lt;/a&gt;, or Mountain &lt;a href=\"Orc\"&gt;Orc&lt;/a&gt;s. As written in the \"&lt;a href=\"The%20House%20of%20Troubles\"&gt;The House of Troubles&lt;/a&gt;,\" Mehrunes Dagon is the god of destruction. He is associated with natural dangers like fire, earthquakes, and floods. To some he represents the inhospitable land of &lt;a href=\"Morrowind\"&gt;Morrowind&lt;/a&gt;. He tests the &lt;a href=\"Dunmer\"&gt;Dunmer&lt;/a&gt; will to survive and persevere.\nAppearance in Skyrim.\nMehrunes Dagon temporarily returns in for the questline &lt;a href=\"Pieces%20of%20the%20Past\"&gt;Pieces of the Past&lt;/a&gt;. After the Dragonborn has acquired the pieces of &lt;a href=\"Mehrunes%27%20Razor\"&gt;Mehrunes' Razor&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Silus%20Vesuius\"&gt;Silus Vesuius&lt;/a&gt; explains that in order to repair the Razor, the Daedric lord himself must be contacted. The Dragonborn is then prompted to meet at Dagon's altar.\nUpon arriving at the altar, Silus quickly greets the Dragonborn and then starts the contacting ritual with Dagon. After the first try, he gets no reply \u2013and then suggests that the Dragonborn tries too. This time Dagon answers, explaining that in order to repair the Razor, the Dragonborn must slay the \"pawn on the board\" (Silus), in order to be his champion and wield the Razor. After accepting or refusing, the Dragonborn hears some last voiceovers from Dagon, and then two &lt;a href=\"Dremora%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Dremora&lt;/a&gt; are summoned to attack.\nUsing the PC version's in-game &lt;a href=\"Console%20Commands%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;console&lt;/a&gt;, the player can spawn an actual Mehrunes Dagon character. However, this character takes on the appearance of a standard Dremora, such as those found in the shrine. This model is likely used as a placeholder, as Dagon's actual model was never meant to be seen in game, explaining the inconsistencies with his previous appearances.\nArtifacts.\nSeveral Artifacts have been attributed to Mehrunes Dagon and all of them primarily evil in both creation and function. Chiefly among them are:\nMysterium Xarxes.\nThe holy book of the Mythic Dawn, written with razors and forged in the fires of blood and death. Penned by Dagon himself and given by him to Mankar Camoran. Its exact contents are for the most part unknown, however it does contain a passage on the subject of domination and enslavement which Camoran reads to his disciples. Camoran would later write a collection of four volumes of commentaries on the Xarxes, these books were kept and read by members of his order and prospective members were required to decipher a hidden code found in the text in order to prove their commitment to Lord Dagon's service. Once they had cracked the code they would be able to locate Dagon's hidden shrine in an event known as the path of dawn. As of the Fourth Era, the only known remnant of the Mysterium Xarxes is a single burnt page in the possession of Silus Vesuius.\nMehrunes Razor.\nAnother famous artifact of Mehrunes Dagon is &lt;a href=\"Mehrunes%27%20Razor\"&gt;Mehrunes' Razor&lt;/a&gt;. This mythical artifact was capable of slaying any creature instantly. This blade was highly prized among assassins. The &lt;a href=\"Hero%20of%20Daggerfall\"&gt;Hero of Daggerfall&lt;/a&gt; was once rewarded by Mehrunes Dagon, after his service of eliminating a troublesome Frost Daedra, with the Razor.\nDecades later, the blade was recovered in bad condition by the &lt;a href=\"Nerevarine\"&gt;Nerevarine&lt;/a&gt; and then Mehrunes Dagon in his shrine of &lt;a href=\"Yasammidan\"&gt;Yasammidan&lt;/a&gt;, restored the blade to its former glory. A deadly weapon crafted by Dagon for his most loyal champions. It takes the form of a jagged dagger which has the ability to kill a person instantly and imprison their soul in Oblivion. The razor was bestowed upon &lt;a href=\"Msirae%20Faythung\"&gt;Msirae Faythung&lt;/a&gt;, who was Dagon's champion until he failed some unknown task and both the razor and its wielder were entombed in &lt;a href=\"Sundercliff%20Watch\"&gt;Sundercliff Watch&lt;/a&gt; until it was recovered by the Champion of Cyrodiil.\nAfter the event of the Oblivion Crisis, several groups were founded or formed to fight the Daedra. One group, \"the keepers of the Razor\" found the dagger and split it into three parts. Almost two hundred years later it would be recovered and repaired by the &lt;a href=\"Last%20Dragonborn\"&gt;Last Dragonborn&lt;/a&gt;."}

The Tomb can be found to the north of &lt;a href=\"Molag%20Mar%20%28Morrowind%29\"&gt;Molag Mar&lt;/a&gt;, however the small Tomb only contains a rusty dagger.

Dagon will then proceed to restore the dagger to its true form, Mehrunes' Razor. Dagon will then give the Razor to the Nerevarine as he believes them to be worthy of wielding it."}
