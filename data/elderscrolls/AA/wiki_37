It is related to the ongoing &lt;a href=\"Goblin%20%28Blades%29\"&gt;goblin&lt;/a&gt; problems. The recommended player level for this quest is level 9. There is one secret in this quest.\nBackground.\n\"Jena Matius says Goblins are hiding out in her patch of forest. I need to root them out.\"\nWalkthrough.\n&lt;a href=\"Gaius%20Platorius\"&gt;Gaius Platorius&lt;/a&gt;, the Imperial envoy sent regarding the goblin problem, informs the &lt;a href=\"Fugitive%20%28Blades%29\"&gt;Fugitive&lt;/a&gt; that &lt;a href=\"Jena%20Matius\"&gt;Jena Matius&lt;/a&gt; has a task for them related to the goblin threat. She will ask you for help with clearing her grove, which had been infested by goblins.\nAfter starting the quest and going to the grove, the &lt;a href=\"Fugitive%20%28Blades%29\"&gt;Fugitive&lt;/a&gt; will have to fight off &lt;a href=\"Wolf%20%28Blades%29\"&gt;wolves&lt;/a&gt; along with the goblins that have overrun the place. As with all other areas, the grove has a linear map, so in order to find the goblins, one needs to head straight. In order to unlock the secret area, you need to activate the skull-decorated lever found where the first &lt;a href=\"Red%20Fang%20Warrior\"&gt;Red Fang Warrior&lt;/a&gt;s are encountered. This will open up a door to the left of the player.\nAlong the way, the Fugitive discovers that goblins from different tribes have formed an alliance, one of them being the \"White Ghost\" tribe, and the other being the \"Red Fang\" tribe. After defeating 10 goblins, the quest will end the Fugitive will head back to the &lt;a href=\"Town%20%28Blades%29\"&gt;town&lt;/a&gt; in order to report to Gaius Platorius. The final goblin is a White Ghost Shaman.\n\"You've got the air of someone who's been killing goblins. The stench, I should say. It went well, then?\"\nAfter completing the quest, if &lt;a href=\"Aranande\"&gt;Aranande&lt;/a&gt; has arrived in the town, speaking to Gaius again will start the next quest, \"&lt;a href=\"Goblins%20United\"&gt;Goblins United&lt;/a&gt;.\" The priest, &lt;a href=\"Guthrum%20of%20the%20Isles\"&gt;Guthrum of the Isles&lt;/a&gt;, will also appear in the town after this quest."}

The cellar itself had its own scents of old wine turned to vinegar, mildew, and the more exotic spices of herbs the healers had brought with them to tend to the wounded. There were more than fifty people squeezed into the big earthen room which had once been forgotten storage for the brothel above. The groaning and whimpering had ceased for now, and all was still, as if the hospital had turned into a mass grave.\n\"Mother,\" a &lt;a href=\"Redguard\"&gt;Redguard&lt;/a&gt; boy whispered. \"What was that?\"\nThe boy's mother was about to answer him when there was another rolling roar from outside, which grew louder and louder, as if some great but incorporeal beast had come into the cellar. The walls trembled and dust burst from the ceiling in a rain of powder.\nUnlike the last time, no one screamed. They waited until the weird, haunting sound had past, and then was replaced by the soft rumble of the distant battle.\nA wounded soldier began whispering Mara's Prayer from the Doomed.\n\"Mankar,\" a &lt;a href=\"Bosmer\"&gt;Bosmer&lt;/a&gt; woman curled up in a cot hissed, her eyes feverish, flesh white and wet with sweat. \"He is coming!\"\n\"Who is coming?\" asked the boy, grasping his mother's skirt tight.\n\"Who do you think, lad? The sweets monger?\" a grizzled one-armed Redguard growled. \"The &lt;a href=\"Camoran%20Usurper\"&gt;Camoran Usurper&lt;/a&gt;.\"\nThe boy's mother shot an angry look at the old warrior. \"She doesn't know what she's saying. She's sick.\"\nThe boy nodded. His mother was usually right. He had not yet even been born when people began whispering that the Camoran Usurper was coming towards her little village, and she had packed up their belongings to flee. Their neighbors had laughed at her, she said, saying that Rihad and Taneth would handily defeat him. Her husband, Lukar's father who he was never to meet, had also laughed at her. It was the harvest time, and she would miss out on the celebrations. But his mother, Miak-I, was right. Two weeks after she fled the village, she heard the tale that it had been obliterated during the night with no survivors. Rihad and Taneth had both fallen. The Usurper was unstoppable.\nLukar had been born and grown up in refugee camps throughout &lt;a href=\"Hammerfell\"&gt;Hammerfell&lt;/a&gt;. He had never known a friend for more than a few days. He knew that when the sky burned red to the west, they would pack up and move east. When it burned to the south, they moved north. At last, after twelve years of moving from camp to camp, they had taken passage across the Iliac Bay to the province of High Rock and the barony of Dwynnen. There Miak-I had promised, and hoped, that they would have a peaceful, permanent home.\nIt was so green there, it blinded him. Unlike Hammerfell, which was only green in certain seasons and in certain places, &lt;a href=\"Dwynnen\"&gt;Dwynnen&lt;/a&gt; was verdant year round. Until wintertide, when it began to snow, and Lukar had been frightened of it at first. He was ashamed to think of it now, when there was real danger, but the red clouds of war, the stink and pain of the refugee camp, that was familiar.\nNow, the red sky was on the horizon of the bay and coming closer, and he longed for the days when a scattering of white made him cry.\n\"Mankar!\" the Bosmer woman cried out again. \"He is coming, and he will bring death!\"\n\"No one is coming,\" said a pretty young Breton healer, coming to the woman's side. \"Hush now.\"\n\"Hello?\" came a voice from above.\nThe whole room, almost together as one gasped. A Bosmer limped down the shoddy wooden stairs, his friendly face very obviously not that of the Camoran Usurper.\n\"Sorry if I frightened you,\" he said. \"I was told there were healers here, and I could use a little help.\"\nRosayna hurried to take a look at the Bosmer's wounds on his leg and chest. Dishelved but still beautiful, she was one of the favorites at the brothel, who had learned her healing skill along with her more vocational skills at the House of Dibella. She carefully but quickly pulled the rent leather cuirass, chausses, tassets, grieves, and boots off him, and placed them to the side while she examined the injuries.\nThe old Redguard warrior picked them up and studied them. \"You were in the war?\"\n\"Next to it is probably a better way to put it,\" the Bosmer smiled, wincing slightly at Rosayna's touch. \"Behind it, beside it, in front of it. My name's Orben Elmlock. I'm a scout. I try to avoid the real battle, so I can get back and report what I see. A good job for people who don't like the color of their own blood very much.\"\n\"Hzim,\" said the warrior, shaking Orben's hand. \"I can't fight anymore, but I can fix up this armor if you're going to return.\"\n\"You're a leathersmith?\"\n\"Naw, just a jack of all trades,\" replied Hzim, opening up a small canister of wax to prep the hard but flexible leather. \"I could tell you were a scout from the armor, though. Can you tell us what you've been spying on? We've been down in here for half a day now, with no word from the outside.\"\n\"The entire &lt;a href=\"Iliac%20Bay\"&gt;Iliac Bay&lt;/a&gt; is one great &lt;a href=\"Battle%20of%20Firewaves\"&gt;battlefield on the waves&lt;/a&gt;,\" said Orben and sighed as Rosayna's spell began to close his jagged but shallow wounds. \"We've shut off the invasion from the mouth of the bay, but I was coming from the coast, and the enemy's army is marching over the Wrothgarian Mountains. That's where I had my little scuffle. It's not too surprising, moving the flank in from the side while the front battle is occupied. It's a play right out of &lt;a href=\"Camoran%20Kaltos\"&gt;Camoran Kaltos&lt;/a&gt;'s book of tricks the Hart-King borrowed.\"\n\"The Hart-King?\" Lukar asked. He had been listening quietly, understanding everything except that.\n\"Haymon Camoran, the Camoran Usurper, Haymon Hart-King, they're all the same, lad. He's a complicated fellow, and needs more than one name.\"\n\"You know him?\" Miak-I asked, stepping forward.\n\"Near on twenty years, before this whole black, bloody business. I was Camoran Kaltos's chief scout, and Haymon was his sorcerer and advisor. I helped them both, when they were vying for the Camoran throne, and began the conquest of - Ouch!\"\nRosayna has ceased her healing. With eyes of fury, she had reversed her spell, and the closed, mended wounds were opening again, dark infections returning. She held him with surprising strength when Orben tried to pull back.\n\"You bastard,\" the healer courtesan hissed. \"I have a cousin in &lt;a href=\"Falinesti\"&gt;Falinesti&lt;/a&gt;, a priestess.\"\n\"She's fine!\" Orben yelped. \"Lord Kaltos was very adamant about not harming anyone who did not pose a threat \u2026\"\n\"I think the people of &lt;a href=\"Kvatch%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;Kvatch&lt;/a&gt; would disagree with that assessment,\" said Hzim, coldly.\n\"That was horrible, the worst thing I have ever seen,\" Orben nodded. \"Kaltos wept when he saw what Haymon had done. My master did everything he could to stop it, begging the Hart-King to return to &lt;a href=\"Valenwood\"&gt;Valenwood&lt;/a&gt;. But he turned on Kaltos, and we fled. We are not your enemy, and we have never been. Kaltos could do nothing to prevent the horror that the Usurper has brought to the &lt;a href=\"Colovian%20West\"&gt;Colovian West&lt;/a&gt; and Hammerfell, and he has fought for fifteen years to prevent more.\"\nThe frightening bestial roar passed through the cellar again, even louder than before. The wounded could not help groaning in helpless terror.\n\"And what is that?\" Miak-I sneered. \"Another of Camoran Kaltos's tricks that the Usurper picked up?\"\n\"It is indeed a trick, as a matter of fact,\" Orben yelled, above the screech. \"It's a phastasm he employs to scare people. He had to use fear tactics in the beginning when his power was ascending, and he has to fall back on them now for his power is waning. That is why it took him two years to conquer Valenwood, and another thirteen to half-conquer Hammerfell. No offense to you Redguards, but it isn't only your battle prowess that has been holding him back. He does not have the support he used to have from his Master -\"\nThe echoing roar increased in intensity before once again falling silent.\n\"Mankar!\" the Bosmer woman groaned. \"He comes, and he will destroy all!\"\n\"His Master?\" asked Lukar, but Orben's eyes had gone to the Bosmer woman, curled up in her blood-soaked cot.\n\"Who is she?\" Orben asked Rosayna.\n\"One of the refugees, of course, from your friendly little war in Valenwood before you and your Kaltos changed sides,\" the healer replied. \"I think her name is Kaalys.\"\n\"By &lt;a href=\"Jephre\"&gt;Jephre&lt;/a&gt;,\" Orben whispered under his breath, limping over to the woman's cot and wiping the sweat and blood streaked hair from her pallid face. \"Kaalys, it's Orben. Do you remember me? How did you get here? Did he hurt you?\"\n\"&lt;a href=\"Mankar%20Camoran\"&gt;Mankar&lt;/a&gt;!\" Kaalys moaned.\n\"That's all she says,\" said Rosayna.\n\"I don't know what that it is,\" Orben frowned. \"Not the Usurper, though she knew him too. Very well. She was a favorite of his.\"\n\"His favorites, you, Kaltos, her, all seem to turn against him,\" said Miak-I.\n\"That is why he will fall,\" replied Hzim.\nArmored footfall rang along the ceiling, and the cellar door burst open. It was the captain of Baron Othrok's castle guards. \"The docks are on fire! If you want to live, you'll need to take refuge at Castle Wightmoor!\"\n\"We need help!\" Rosayna called back, but she knew that the guards were needed for defense, not to help carry the sick to safety.\nWith ten guards who could be spared and the most able-bodied of the wounded assisting, the cellar was emptied as the streets of Dwynnen filled with smoke, and fire began to spread through the chaos. It had been a single fireball miscast out at sea striking the docks, but the damage would be tremendous. Some hours later, in the courtyard of the mighty castle, the healers were able to set up the cots and begin to tend once again to the suffering of the innocent. The first person Rosayna found was Orben Elmlock. Even with his wounds reopened, he had helped carry two of the patients into the castle.\n\"I'm sorry,\" she said as she pressed her healing hands onto his wounds. \"I lost my temper. I forgot that I am a healer.\"\n\"Where is Kaalys?\" Orben asked.\n\"She's not here?\" Rosayna said, looking around. \"She must have run away.\"\n\"Run away? But wasn't she injured?\"\n\"It was not a healthy situation, but new mothers can surprise you with what they can do when it's all over.\"\n\"She was pregnant?\" Orben gasped\n\"Yes. It wasn't such a difficult birth in the end. She was holding the boy in her arms when I saw her last. She said she had done it herself.\"\n\"She was pregnant,\" Orben murmured again. \"The mistress of the Camoran Usurper was pregnant.\"\nWord quickly spread throughout the castle that the battle was over, and more than that, the war was over. Haymon Camoran's forces had been defeated at sea, and in the mountains. The Hart-King was dead.\nLukar watched down from the battlements into the dark woods that surrounded Dwynnen. He had heard about Kaalys, and he imagined a desperate woman fleeing with her newborn baby in her arms into the wilderness. Kaalys would have nowhere to go, no one to protect them. She and her baby would be a refugee, like Miak-I and him had been. Reflecting back, he remembered her words.\nHe is coming. He is coming, and he will bring death. He will destroy all.\nLukar remembered her eyes. She was sick, but not afraid. Who was this \"He\" who was coming if the Camoran Usurper was dead?\n\"Did she say nothing else?\" asked Orben.\n\"She told me the baby's name,\" Rosayna replied. \"Mankar.\""}

So long as crews hoist sails and fare the seas, they'll sing shanties of ol' &lt;a href=\"Cyrus%20%28Redguard%29\"&gt;Cyrus&lt;/a&gt;, hero of &lt;a href=\"Stros%20M%27Kai\"&gt;Stros M'Kai&lt;/a&gt;.\nBut what became of him when the fighting was done? If it were only a tale, the book would close, but life has a habit of adding pages where they shouldn't be.\nSome say he sailed west, to lands uncharted. But others contend he took command of the legendary ship, &lt;a href=\"Dead%20Man%27s%20Dread\"&gt;Dead Man's Dread&lt;/a&gt;, and sailed north, drawn by the stories of &lt;a href=\"Tobias\"&gt;Tobias&lt;/a&gt;. There he hunted for treasures new and old, all across the &lt;a href=\"Sea%20of%20Ghosts\"&gt;Sea of Ghosts&lt;/a&gt;. Over time he amassed a great fortune, and lived out the rest of his days on calm waters.\nWhere this fortune is now, is a mystery long forgotten. You'll hear talk of a &lt;a href=\"Blackbone%20Isle\"&gt;Blackbone Isle&lt;/a&gt;, but you won't find it on any map. The last man who claimed to know its location was a pirate by the name of &lt;a href=\"Kevon\"&gt;Kevon&lt;/a&gt;. Yet as a wanted man of little clout, he died in &lt;a href=\"Castle%20Dour%20Dungeon\"&gt;Castle Dour Dungeon&lt;/a&gt;, taking the fate of the treasure with him.\nA strange ending to a great tale, but who knows if the writing's done. For a man's hunt for gold is as restless as his desire to be free."}

From there, the first Men split up as they emigrated from Tamriel, looking for new homes across the sea, eventually settling in places such as &lt;a href=\"Yokuda\"&gt;Yokuda&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Atmora\"&gt;Atmora&lt;/a&gt;, where they founded their first civilizations.\nEventually though, &lt;a href=\"Atmoran\"&gt;Atmoran&lt;/a&gt; Men slowly, but surely, began to come back down to Tamriel, starting to explore the lands that their ancestors had left behind many generations ago. With time, some of their number even started taking up permanent residence in Skyrim, founding several settlements, most prominently &lt;a href=\"Saarthal\"&gt;Saarthal&lt;/a&gt;, which in time grew into mankind's first proper city on Tamriel.\nUp until the late Merethic Era, the &lt;a href=\"Snow%20Elves\"&gt;Snow Elves&lt;/a&gt; of Skyrim had lived in peace with the Atmoran settlers, but things started to change, and the elves began to grow increasingly uneasy towards the settlers, and eventually outright hostility followed. The exact reason why is not entirely know, but scholars speculate that the elves saw that humankind was growing at an exponential rate, given a human's faster reproductive period, and feeling threatened by this rapid expansion, they started a genocidal campaign against them. What is known, however, is that the elves made a night-time surprise attack on Saarthal, killed the vast majority of its citizens, and reduced the city to ruins, in an event that would be known as the &lt;a href=\"Night%20of%20Tears\"&gt;Night of Tears&lt;/a&gt;.\nAlmost the entire human population of Skyrim was wiped out. Only three people were purported to have survived the attack on the capital city of &lt;a href=\"Saarthal\"&gt;Saarthal&lt;/a&gt;. They were &lt;a href=\"Ysgramor\"&gt;Ysgramor&lt;/a&gt; and his two sons, &lt;a href=\"Yngol\"&gt;Yngol&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Ylgar\"&gt;Ylgar&lt;/a&gt;. They escaped Skyrim on the last longboat back to their homeland, &lt;a href=\"Atmora\"&gt;Atmora&lt;/a&gt;. Upon arriving to Atmora, Ysgramor told stories of treacherous elves and of gathering an army to come back and avenge the lost souls.\nReturn of the men.\nOn the day known as &lt;a href=\"Day%20of%20Final%20Passage\"&gt;Day of Final Passage&lt;/a&gt; Ysgramor and his army, the &lt;a href=\"Five%20Hundred%20Companions\"&gt;Five Hundred Companions&lt;/a&gt;, left the port of &lt;a href=\"Jylkurfyk\"&gt;Jylkurfyk&lt;/a&gt; on the continent of Atmora, to sail back to &lt;a href=\"Skyrim\"&gt;Mereth&lt;/a&gt; and take back what was rightfully theirs.\nDuring their voyage to Mereth, The Five Hundred got caught in the &lt;a href=\"Storm%20of%20Separation\"&gt;Storm of Separation&lt;/a&gt;. As a result, the legendary Ysgramor lost his eldest son, Yngol. &lt;a href=\"Yngol%20Barrow\"&gt;Yngol Barrow&lt;/a&gt; was made as a proper burial place for an &lt;a href=\"Atmoran\"&gt;Atmoran&lt;/a&gt; warrior.\nShortly after the Five Hundred arrived at &lt;a href=\"Hsaarik%20Head\"&gt;Hsaarik Head&lt;/a&gt;, Saarthal was taken back from the elves. The first goal of the Five Hundred was fulfilled and the next was yet to plan. The &lt;a href=\"Circle%20of%20Captains\"&gt;Circle of Captains&lt;/a&gt; was assembled and it was decided that every &lt;a href=\"Captain%20%28Lore%29\"&gt;captain&lt;/a&gt; and his crew should go their own ways. Thus began a period of genocidal slaughter of elves.\nThe first notable event to be recorded was the founding of &lt;a href=\"Whiterun\"&gt;Whiterun&lt;/a&gt;. The crew of the &lt;a href=\"Jorrvaskr%20%28Ship%29\"&gt;Jorrvaskr&lt;/a&gt; under command of &lt;a href=\"Jeek%20of%20the%20River\"&gt;Jeek of the River&lt;/a&gt; scouted the area later named &lt;a href=\"Whiterun%20Hold\"&gt;Whiterun Hold&lt;/a&gt;. They found a &lt;a href=\"Skyforge\"&gt;mysterious monument&lt;/a&gt; that was feared by local elves and decided to put it to proper use. The lands in this valley were suitable for harvest as well. The crew settled there not knowing that they had started a settlement that would later grow into a great city that still stood in Fourth Era.\nThe second notable event to be recorded was the founding of &lt;a href=\"Windhelm\"&gt;Windhelm&lt;/a&gt;. The crews of the &lt;a href=\"Kaal%20Kaaz\"&gt;Kaal Kaaz&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Sadon%20Reyth\"&gt;Sadon Reyth&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Ylgermet\"&gt;Ylgermet&lt;/a&gt;, under command of &lt;a href=\"Harbinger%20%28Rank%29\"&gt;Harbinger&lt;/a&gt; Ysgramor himself, fought elves in the area later named &lt;a href=\"Eastmarch\"&gt;Eastmarch&lt;/a&gt;. Ysgramor stumbled upon his son's grave and in his grief decided to build a great city where the nearby river, &lt;a href=\"White%20River\"&gt;White River&lt;/a&gt;, met the &lt;a href=\"Sea%20of%20Ghosts\"&gt;Sea of Ghosts&lt;/a&gt;. The city was to serve as a monument of all mankind. It was built by elven captives in Atmorian fashion. A long bridge was built as the only entrance to the city, so that no elf could sneak in unnoticed to avenge his own kin. As well as Whiterun, Windhelm still stood in the Fourth Era as one of the biggest cities in Skyrim.\nEnd of the Return.\nThe period along with the great expansion of mankind and a merciless reprisal campaign against the elves ended with the death of Ysgramor. News of his death spread like a dark cloud all over Tamriel, and most of the warriors put down their weapons in grief never to pick them up again. Ysgramor chose to be buried at sea, looking in the direction of his true homeland, Atmora. But even after death of the great Harbinger, his castle served High Kings for many generations after.\nHowever, by the end of the Return, Man had already gained a permanent standing in Skyrim. &lt;a href=\"Snow%20Elves\"&gt;Snow Elves&lt;/a&gt; had been banished underground, to emerge only thousands of years later as the beasts known as &lt;a href=\"Falmer\"&gt;Falmer&lt;/a&gt;. Tamriel soon became the only home for men, as Atmora had froze beyond recognition and had ceased to be a haven of settlement and survivability."}

In addition to their mass of clawlike limbs, pincers, and scuttling feet protruding from a human-torso-sized skeletal frame, the dreugh wear armored hides and secrete shell wax that are prized in some quarters. They are aquatic scavengers, spending much of their time in deep ocean water. Local fishermen tell of altercations with this species (such as when the dreugh cut fishermen's nets to steal fish), but dreugh are mostly mild-mannered, except during karvinasim, their period of transformation.\nDuring karvinasim, the dreugh walk upon land, favoring shoreline marshes and rivers close to open water. Hatchlings are closely guarded, and broodmothers are extremely territorial, reacting to invaders with both speed and hostility. This lends credence to the notion that karvinasim heightens the dreugh's martial instincts: Indeed, after witnessing the evisceration of our lead geographer Pulcherus Pomptinus, our raiding party thought twice before capturing and culling further specimens.\nAfter a year of land walking, the dreugh return to the water. As they submerge, they undergo a final transformation known as \"meff,\" where they devour their land skin and air organs - the body parts they longer need - and then vomit the congealed remains as small fibrous balls that are approximately a foot in diameter. These disgusting and foul-smelling spheres are known as \"grom\" and are found in clusters around lakes. So far, our apothecaries have discovered no virtues on grom, aside from inducing queasiness in some of the more weak-stomached members of this contingent."}

{"id": "870008", "revid": "32911304", "url": "https://elderscrolls.fandom.com/wiki?curid=870008", "title": "The Rift", "text": "The Rift, otherwise known as Rift Hold, is the a densely-forested &lt;a href=\"region\"&gt;region&lt;/a&gt; located in eastern &lt;a href=\"Skyrim\"&gt;Skyrim&lt;/a&gt; near the &lt;a href=\"Morrowind\"&gt;Morrowind&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Cyrodiil\"&gt;Cyrodiil&lt;/a&gt; borders. Rift is situated between many mountain ranges, including the &lt;a href=\"Jerall%20Mountains\"&gt;Jerall Mountains&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Velothi%20Mountains\"&gt;Velothi Mountains&lt;/a&gt;.\nDescription.\nGeography.\n&lt;a href=\"Stony%20Basin\"&gt;Stony Basin&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe Rift is a sprawling sea of bright trees and mildly cool temperatures that separate the Rift from the rest of Skyrim. The &lt;a href=\"Stony%20Basin\"&gt;Stony Basin&lt;/a&gt; is the lower half of the region, and it shows. As you move southward towards &lt;a href=\"Riften\"&gt;Riften&lt;/a&gt;, the temperature becomes much warmer, and the area begins to rise. The only significant settlement located in the Basin is &lt;a href=\"Shor%27s%20Stone\"&gt;Shor's Stone&lt;/a&gt; (an &lt;a href=\"Ebony\"&gt;Ebony&lt;/a&gt; mining settlement) and &lt;a href=\"Fort%20Greenwall\"&gt;Fort Greenwall&lt;/a&gt;, the primary bulwark of the region's capital. The basin is also more forest-like with such sites as the &lt;a href=\"Vernim%20Woods\"&gt;Vernim Woods&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Autumnshade%20Clearing\"&gt;Autumnshade Clearing&lt;/a&gt; appearing in the area.\n&lt;a href=\"Ragged%20Hills\"&gt;Ragged Hills&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe Ragged Hills is much more mountainous and much colder as it is located at the base of the &lt;a href=\"Throat%20of%20the%20World\"&gt;Throat of the World&lt;/a&gt;. Dead in the center of the Hills is &lt;a href=\"Lake%20Geir\"&gt;Lake Geir&lt;/a&gt;, which serves as the primary source of food for the surrounding settlements in the area. A few notable settlements dot the landscape including &lt;a href=\"Ivarstead\"&gt;Ivarstead&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Nimalten\"&gt;Nimalten&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Geirmund%27s%20Hall\"&gt;Geirmund's Hall&lt;/a&gt;. The town of Ivarstead is the beginning of the pilgrimage to &lt;a href=\"High%20Hrothgar\"&gt;High Hrothgar&lt;/a&gt; which begins at &lt;a href=\"The%20Seven%20Thousand%20Steps\"&gt;The Seven Thousand Steps&lt;/a&gt;. West of Nimalten is a pass between the Snow &lt;a href=\"The%20Towers\"&gt;Tower&lt;/a&gt; and the Jerall Mountains known as the &lt;a href=\"Lion%27s%20Den\"&gt;Lion's Den&lt;/a&gt;. This pass connects Nimalten to &lt;a href=\"Helgen\"&gt;Helgen&lt;/a&gt;.\n&lt;a href=\"Smokefrost%20Peaks\"&gt;Smokefrost Peaks&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe Smokefrost Peaks is the warmest region in the Rift. This has to do with its proximity to the volcanic mountain of &lt;a href=\"Trolhetta\"&gt;Trolhetta&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Velothi%20Mountains\"&gt;Velothi Mountains&lt;/a&gt;. Those who come from &lt;a href=\"Stonefalls\"&gt;Stonefalls&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Fort%20Virak\"&gt;Fort Virak&lt;/a&gt; will end up passing Trolhetta and the &lt;a href=\"Dayspring%20Canyon\"&gt;Dayspring Canyon&lt;/a&gt;. The major settlement in the region is &lt;a href=\"Riften\"&gt;Riften&lt;/a&gt;, the capital of both Smokefrost Peaks and the Rift. Riften is built on the shores of &lt;a href=\"Lake%20Honrich\"&gt;Lake Honrich&lt;/a&gt;. The Lake is vast, almost as large as &lt;a href=\"Lake%20Ilinalta\"&gt;Lake Ilinalta&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Falkreath%20Hold\"&gt;Falkreath Hold&lt;/a&gt;. There have been many notable settlements including Riften, &lt;a href=\"Fort%20Dawnguard\"&gt;Fort Dawnguard&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Largashbur\"&gt;Largashbur&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Skald%27s%20Retreat\"&gt;Skald's Retreat&lt;/a&gt;. Riften is a major trading capital in northern Tamriel.\nFauna.\nWolves.\n&lt;a href=\"Wolves\"&gt;Wolves&lt;/a&gt; are the most common predators in any part of northern Tamriel. The &lt;a href=\"Ice%20Wolf\"&gt;ice wolves&lt;/a&gt; in northern Skyrim tend to be much more dangerous. Wolves travel in packs and attack all at once. Sometimes they will move in specific directions to confuse their prey and catch them off guard. Once a wolf spots you, they will signal their friends, and they will surround you. Despite their substantial numbers, a wolf is not hard to take down. A couple strikes from a well-sharpened blade can kill off those bastards quickly.\nBears.\n&lt;a href=\"Bear\"&gt;Bear&lt;/a&gt;s are a somewhat common predator found from the &lt;a href=\"Eastern%20Reach\"&gt;Eastern Reach&lt;/a&gt; to &lt;a href=\"Eastmarch\"&gt;Eastmarch&lt;/a&gt;. Bears are carnivorous and tend to live alone in mountains and remote caves in the Forest. Bears are large, furry creatures that come in shades of brown, black, and white all depending on the location. Bears are also bulky and can take more hits than a wolf can. They have sharp claws that can tear flesh off anything.\nFrostbite Spiders.\n&lt;a href=\"Frostbite%20Spider\"&gt;Frostbite Spider&lt;/a&gt;s are large arachnids that can be found in the southern Rift. They are more common in the Rift and &lt;a href=\"Falkreath%20Hold\"&gt;Falkreath Hold&lt;/a&gt; compared to any other part of Skyrim. Sometimes, they come in packs of two while sometimes, they attack alone. They spit the &lt;a href=\"Frostbite%20Venom\"&gt;Frostbite Venom&lt;/a&gt; from afar and can leap with a massive amount of force. They will wrap up their prey into thick layers of webs to put down any resistance. They will then eat their victim from the webs.\nSpriggans.\n&lt;a href=\"Spriggan\"&gt;Spriggan&lt;/a&gt;s are glowing green humanoid creatures with bodies made of wood. They are people of the forest. A Spriggan can take control of a nearby critter and use it against a threat; they can blast a foe with a swarm of insects and use &lt;a href=\"Invisibility\"&gt;Invisibility&lt;/a&gt; to catch unsuspecting prey off guard. When they are damaged, they can restore their health.\nTrolls.\nTrolls are large burly creatures that stand on their legs somewhat like a feral &lt;a href=\"Imga\"&gt;Imga&lt;/a&gt;. Trolls can tower over &lt;a href=\"High%20Elves\"&gt;High Elves&lt;/a&gt; if they were not so slouched over. They have fur on their face, shoulders, chest, waist, knees, and hands. They have large spikes growing across their arms, legs, shoulders, and face. They also have three eyes, one on their forehead.\nFlora.\nAs mentioned before, the Rift is a sprawling sea of bright and colorful trees. The Rift has a variety of trees such as , , and each coming in shades of red, orange, or yellow. The Rift was given its name for how different it was compared to the other &lt;a href=\"Old%20Holds\"&gt;Old Holds&lt;/a&gt; discovered in the &lt;a href=\"Merethic%20Era\"&gt;Merethic Era&lt;/a&gt;. Because of the nearby mountain ranges, the Rift grows all sorts of &lt;a href=\"Mountain%20Flowers\"&gt;Mountain Flowers&lt;/a&gt;. Other plants including &lt;a href=\"Lavender\"&gt;Lavender&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Canis%20Root\"&gt;Canis Root&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Scaly%20Pholiota\"&gt;Scaly Pholiota&lt;/a&gt;, and wild &lt;a href=\"Gourd\"&gt;Gourd&lt;/a&gt;s grow here. In the &lt;a href=\"Fourth%20Era\"&gt;Fourth Era&lt;/a&gt;, two &lt;a href=\"Dunmer\"&gt;Dunmer&lt;/a&gt;i sisters grew &lt;a href=\"Nirnroot\"&gt;Nirnroot&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;a href=\"Ragged%20Hills\"&gt;Ragged Hills&lt;/a&gt;.\nFarms near &lt;a href=\"Lake%20Geir\"&gt;Lake Geir&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Lake%20Honrich\"&gt;Lake Honrich&lt;/a&gt; grow a lot of crops and sells it to the merchants in Riften. Farmers grow plants such as &lt;a href=\"Cabbage%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Cabbage&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Wheat\"&gt;Wheat&lt;/a&gt;, Gourds, and &lt;a href=\"Leek\"&gt;Leek&lt;/a&gt;s. In the lakes, &lt;a href=\"Nordic%20Barnacle\"&gt;Nordic Barnacle&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"White%20Cap\"&gt;White Cap&lt;/a&gt; grows inside or under the water.\nGovernment.\nRiften is the ruling stronghold, and whoever takes control of Riften, they have control of the entire Rift and smaller settlements like Nimalten and Shor's Stone. &lt;a href=\"The%20Greybeards\"&gt;The Greybeards&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"High%20Hrothgar\"&gt;High Hrothgar&lt;/a&gt; tend to keep to themselves, so they are not affected by this. The &lt;a href=\"Orsimer\"&gt;Orsimer&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Largashbur\"&gt;Largashbur&lt;/a&gt; are also not affected this, the Orcs follow their laws known as the &lt;a href=\"Code%20of%20Malacath\"&gt;Code of Malacath&lt;/a&gt;. The Code is fairly simple: it revolves around the key legislation of no stealing and fighting for honor. Leaders of the stronghold are Chieftains, who are elected by defeating the previous chieftain.\nIn Riften, the head of the city is known as the &lt;a href=\"Jarl\"&gt;Jarl&lt;/a&gt;. The title of Jarl is usually hereditary; the title is passed down for generations which is evident with &lt;a href=\"Ulfric%20Stormcloak\"&gt;Ulfric Stormcloak&lt;/a&gt;, who inherited the title from &lt;a href=\"Hoag%20Stormcloak\"&gt;Hoag Stormcloak&lt;/a&gt;. Sometimes, the position of Jarl is given those who proved themselves worthy. Jarls can give people the title of &lt;a href=\"Thane%20%28Title%29\"&gt;Thane&lt;/a&gt;, which is an honorary title for those who have much importance in a city-state.\nReligion.\nUnlike the fiefdoms and baronies in the &lt;a href=\"Iliac%20Bay\"&gt;Iliac Bay&lt;/a&gt;, there in no centralized religion throughout the Rift. Riften was commissioned by the &lt;a href=\"Septim%20Empire\"&gt;Septim Empire&lt;/a&gt; to have a temple dedicated to &lt;a href=\"Mara\"&gt;Mara&lt;/a&gt; of the &lt;a href=\"Nine%20Divines\"&gt;Nine Divines&lt;/a&gt; located on the western side of Riften, right next to Mistveil Keep. Since Riften owns settlements such as &lt;a href=\"Ivarstead\"&gt;Ivarstead&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Shor%27s%20Stone\"&gt;Shor's Stone&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Nimalten\"&gt;Nimalten&lt;/a&gt; in can be assumed that these townships worship Mara as well. But since there many private settlements in the Rift, that would not be the case.\nThe Orcish Stronghold of Largashbur worships &lt;a href=\"Malacath\"&gt;Malacath&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"Daedric%20Prince\"&gt;Daedric Prince&lt;/a&gt; of the Sworn Oath and the Bloody Curse. Malacath was believed to be the first Orsimer after &lt;a href=\"Boethiah\"&gt;Boethiah&lt;/a&gt; defeated him and devoured his essence when he was &lt;a href=\"Trinimac\"&gt;Trinimac&lt;/a&gt;. His followers turned into the Orcs and they have followed Malacath since the &lt;a href=\"Merethic%20Era\"&gt;Merethic Era&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Greybeards\"&gt;Greybeards&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"High%20Hrothgar\"&gt;High Hrothgar&lt;/a&gt; remain isolated from the rest of Skyrim in the &lt;a href=\"Throat%20of%20the%20World\"&gt;Throat of the World&lt;/a&gt;. The Greybeards are monks that follow the teachings of &lt;a href=\"Jurgen%20Windcaller\"&gt;Jurgen Windcaller&lt;/a&gt;, an Ancient Nord that gave the Nords the gift known as the &lt;a href=\"Thu%27um\"&gt;Thu'um&lt;/a&gt;. The Greybeards are the remaining few that harness the Thu'um as both a way of life and a martial art lost on the people of Tamriel. The Greybeards are taught by a timeless &lt;a href=\"Dragons%20%28Lore%29\"&gt;Dragon&lt;/a&gt; known as &lt;a href=\"Paarthurnax%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Paarthurnax&lt;/a&gt; who fought alongside Windcaller in their time.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Thieves%20Guild\"&gt;Thieves Guild&lt;/a&gt; is very prominent in Riften, and they worship &lt;a href=\"Nocturnal\"&gt;Nocturnal&lt;/a&gt;, the Daedric Prince of Luck and the Shadows. Nocturnal defines the traits that make Thief and her sphere of influence is what Thieves need to become successful. The Ratways is where the Thieves Guild lurks and they have a statue of Nocturnal sitting in the center. The &lt;a href=\"Nightingales\"&gt;Nightingales&lt;/a&gt; are Nocturnal's personal champions and they have influence through the Rift.\nHistory.\n&lt;a href=\"Merethic%20Era\"&gt;Merethic Era&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe Atmoran Expedition into the Rift.\nAfter landing on the northern shores of Skyrim from &lt;a href=\"Jylkurfyk\"&gt;Jylkurfyk&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Atmora\"&gt;Atmora&lt;/a&gt;, the crew of the &lt;a href=\"Fallowfire\"&gt;Fallowfire&lt;/a&gt;, led by &lt;a href=\"Captain%20%28Lore%29\"&gt;Captain&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Gurilda%20Sharktooth\"&gt;Gurilda Sharktooth&lt;/a&gt;, set forth southwards to discover land in the name of &lt;a href=\"Ysgramor\"&gt;Ysgramor&lt;/a&gt; and his &lt;a href=\"Five%20Hundred%20Companions\"&gt;Five Hundred Companions&lt;/a&gt;. Compared to the other companions, the Fallowfire crew had traveled much more south since they could not find anymore land not occupied by other Atmoran Companions. Gurilda led her group through a series of mountains known as &lt;a href=\"Ysgramor%27s%20Teeth\"&gt;Ysgramor's Teeth&lt;/a&gt; to eventually find a new unexplored region they dubbed the Rift.\nAfter slaughtering many &lt;a href=\"Snow%20Elf\"&gt;Snow Elven&lt;/a&gt; settlements throughout the Rift, the Mer mustered an army to fight the Fallowfire crew. The battle lasted for a day and many companions including Gurilda Sharktooth died in the conflict. &lt;a href=\"Vikord%20One-Eye\"&gt;Vikord One-Eye&lt;/a&gt;, the first mate of Gurilda's crew commissioned &lt;a href=\"Fallowstone%20Hall\"&gt;Fallowstone Hall&lt;/a&gt; to be built on the battle site. The hall became the main headquarters of the Companions in the Rift.\n&lt;a href=\"First%20Era\"&gt;First Era&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe Gauldurson Conflict and Geirmund's Hall.\nDuring the first era, &lt;a href=\"Geirmund\"&gt;Geirmund&lt;/a&gt; was the &lt;a href=\"Arch-Mage\"&gt;Arch-Mage&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"Windhelm\"&gt;Windhelm&lt;/a&gt;. Arch-Mage &lt;a href=\"Gauldur\"&gt;Gauldur&lt;/a&gt; was slain by his three sons, &lt;a href=\"Mikrul%20Gauldurson\"&gt;Mikrul Gauldurson&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Jyrik%20Gauldurson\"&gt;Jyrik Gauldurson&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Sigdis%20Gauldurson\"&gt;Sigdis Gauldurson&lt;/a&gt;. Geirmund hunted down the three brothers a slew then one by one. His first victim was Mikrul who was killed and sealed away in &lt;a href=\"Folgunthur\"&gt;Folgunthur&lt;/a&gt;. The second victim was Jyrik who fought ten veteran mages, he was then overpowered and trapped within &lt;a href=\"Saarthal\"&gt;Saarthal&lt;/a&gt;, which was already half-buried. The last one was Sigdis who fled to the Rift. Sigdis challenged Geirmund to a duel which ended in both dying near Ivarstead. &lt;a href=\"High%20King\"&gt;High King&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Harald\"&gt;Harald&lt;/a&gt; erected a &lt;a href=\"Geirmund%27s%20Hall\"&gt;tomb&lt;/a&gt; which houses both Geirmund's and Sigdis' corpses. In the second era, an &lt;a href=\"Geirmund%27s%20Hall%20%28Online%29\"&gt;estate&lt;/a&gt; was built atop of the crypt. A festival was held here to honor Geirmund and his triumphs.\nAtop the Summit; Forelhost Temple.\nIn &lt;a href=\"1E%20139\"&gt;1E 139&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Skorm%20Snow-Strider\"&gt;Skorm Snow-Strider&lt;/a&gt; and his army was sent by High King Harald to vanquish the Snow Elves located in the Rift and across &lt;a href=\"Lake%20Honrich\"&gt;Lake Honrich&lt;/a&gt;. By the end of &lt;a href=\"Sun%27s%20Dusk\"&gt;Sun's Dusk&lt;/a&gt;, Snow-Strider managed to push back the elves as far as the Smokefrost Peaks. Intel came in reporting about a hidden fortress located on the southern mountain that may be the Snow Elven headquarters. With a band of fighters, Snow-Strider scaled the mountain to find an abandoned &lt;a href=\"Dragon%20Priest\"&gt;Dragon Priest&lt;/a&gt; monastery known as &lt;a href=\"Forelhost\"&gt;Forelhost&lt;/a&gt;. Determined to destroy the Falmer, Snow-Strider besieged the ruins and entered the remains. His troops suffered heavy casualties such as the never-ending blizzard and the bad food supply. In about a month, Snow-Strider barely survived, and the remaining warriors fled the premises.\n&lt;a href=\"Second%20Era\"&gt;Second Era&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe Unified Eastern Kingdom of Skyrim.\nIn &lt;a href=\"2E%20431\"&gt;2E 431&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"Reman%20Empire\"&gt;Reman Empire&lt;/a&gt; had finally fallen, and High King &lt;a href=\"Logrolf\"&gt;Logrolf&lt;/a&gt; was assassinated. The next ruler of Skyrim came with controversy from the grand city states of &lt;a href=\"Solitude\"&gt;Solitude&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Windhelm\"&gt;Windhelm&lt;/a&gt;. Jarl &lt;a href=\"Svartr\"&gt;Svartr&lt;/a&gt; of Solitude claimed Logrolf's daughter, &lt;a href=\"Freydis\"&gt;Freydis&lt;/a&gt; is an illegitimate heir to the throne. This was the first time someone questioned the legitimacy of the &lt;a href=\"Crown%20of%20Verity\"&gt;Crown of Verity&lt;/a&gt;, the ancient crown that determines the High King of Skyrim. The first person to question its judgment was &lt;a href=\"Asurn%20Ice-Breaker\"&gt;Asurn Ice-Breaker&lt;/a&gt; who lost to &lt;a href=\"Kjoric%20the%20White\"&gt;Kjoric the White&lt;/a&gt;. The crown named Freydis the next ruler of Skyrim, while the &lt;a href=\"Moot\"&gt;Moot&lt;/a&gt; named Svartr the High King of Skyrim. This caused Skyrim to divided into two different states. The Kingdoms of Eastern Skyrim (&lt;a href=\"Eastmarch\"&gt;Eastmarch&lt;/a&gt;, the Rift, &lt;a href=\"the%20Pale\"&gt;the Pale&lt;/a&gt;, and the &lt;a href=\"Winterhold%20%28Region%29\"&gt;Winterhold&lt;/a&gt;) followed Freydis while the Kingdoms of Western Skyrim (&lt;a href=\"Haafingar\"&gt;Haafingar&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Whiterun%20Hold\"&gt;Whiterun Hold&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Falkreath%20Hold\"&gt;Falkreath Hold&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Hjaalmarch\"&gt;Hjaalmarch&lt;/a&gt;) followed Svartr.\nExtracting the bones of Sinmur in Shor's Stone.\nAfter defeating &lt;a href=\"Fildgor%20Orcthane\"&gt;Fildgor Orcthane&lt;/a&gt; of the &lt;a href=\"Stormfist%20Clan\"&gt;Stormfist Clan&lt;/a&gt; at &lt;a href=\"Skuldafn\"&gt;Skuldafn&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"Ebonheart%20Pact\"&gt;Ebonheart Pact&lt;/a&gt; must deal with the &lt;a href=\"Boneshaper%20Clan\"&gt;Boneshaper Clan&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"Reachman\"&gt;Reachman&lt;/a&gt; who have infiltrated the &lt;a href=\"Redbelly%20Mine\"&gt;Redbelly Mine&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Shor%27s%20Stone\"&gt;Shor's Stone&lt;/a&gt;. The &lt;a href=\"Vestige\"&gt;Vestige&lt;/a&gt; was sent in to take down the Boneshaper Clan and to find out why to attack Shor's Stone. To do so, the Vestige must break into the mine which is sealed off by the Boneshapers. After destroying the wards, the Pact entered the mine and fought the Reachman. The Vestige had defeated the Reachman, but it was in vain as the giant of legend, &lt;a href=\"Sinmur\"&gt;Sinmur&lt;/a&gt;, has been restored once again.\nRetaking Fallowstone Hall.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Rageclaw%20Clan\"&gt;Rageclaw Clan&lt;/a&gt; of Reachmen led by &lt;a href=\"Chieftain%20Frostfang\"&gt;Chieftain Frostfang&lt;/a&gt; had assaulted the legendary &lt;a href=\"Fallowstone%20Hall\"&gt;Fallowstone Hall&lt;/a&gt; to take the almighty axe known as &lt;a href=\"Wuuthrad\"&gt;Wuuthrad&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href=\"Vigrod%20Wraithbane\"&gt;Vigrod Wraithbane&lt;/a&gt; led the force that retook the Hall. The Vestige rescued survivors from the previous attack and needed to reach the inner vault to secure Wuuthrad. To do so, they needed to summon &lt;a href=\"Sage%20Tirora\"&gt;Sage Tirora&lt;/a&gt; to open the keep. Once inside, the Vestige confronted Frostfang and defeated him in combat. Further, into the hall, the Vestige finds the statue of &lt;a href=\"Ysgramor\"&gt;Ysgramor&lt;/a&gt; but only to find Wuuthrad gone. There have been reports made that &lt;a href=\"Order%20of%20the%20Black%20Worm\"&gt;Order of the Black Worm&lt;/a&gt; has appeared with the Reachman at the Vernim Woods.\nWorm Cult Vermin at Vernim Woods.\nThe Ebonheart Pact tracked the Reachmen to Vernim Woods. The Reachman had formed an alliance with the Worm Cult where the cult would resurrect &lt;a href=\"Sinmur\"&gt;Sinmur&lt;/a&gt; in exchange for a blessing from &lt;a href=\"Molag%20Bal\"&gt;Molag Bal&lt;/a&gt;. The leader of the Boneshaper Clan, &lt;a href=\"Stral%20Blackthroat\"&gt;Stral Blackthroat&lt;/a&gt;, had started the ritual in the Vaults of Vernim. A Pact spy named &lt;a href=\"Belron\"&gt;Belron&lt;/a&gt; comes up with a plan requiring the hearts of Reachman champions. With the hearts gathered, the Vestige was able to enter the Vaults of Vernim and defeat Blackthroat. With the Reachman beaten, the only force left to fight is the Worm Cult who had taken Wuuthrad and with it, Sinmur's control.\nThe Phantom Menace of Nimalten.\nThe tension was high in &lt;a href=\"Nimalten\"&gt;Nimalten&lt;/a&gt;, a fairly recent assassination attempt was made on &lt;a href=\"Thane%20Fjora\"&gt;Thane Fjora&lt;/a&gt; and has Nimalten on high alert. &lt;a href=\"Aera%20Earth-Turner\"&gt;Aera Earth-Turner&lt;/a&gt;, a former refugee during the &lt;a href=\"Daggerfall%20Covenant\"&gt;Daggerfall Covenant&lt;/a&gt;'s conquest over &lt;a href=\"Bleakrock%20Isle\"&gt;Bleakrock Isle&lt;/a&gt; was in charge of the investigation. The Vestige was sent to investigate &lt;a href=\"Housecarl\"&gt;Housecarl&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Betar-Nes\"&gt;Betar-Nes&lt;/a&gt;' &lt;a href=\"Betar%20Nes%27%20House\"&gt;house&lt;/a&gt;. The Vestige learned that Sinmur requires spirits to awaken his power. The traveler reported back to Aera who informed them about &lt;a href=\"Golun%20Drenduf\"&gt;Golun Drenduf&lt;/a&gt;'s demise by the Worm Cult. They learn that the Worm Cult plans to use the spirit of dead &lt;a href=\"The%20Companions\"&gt;Companions&lt;/a&gt; to fuel Sinmur and that they are gathering in &lt;a href=\"Nimalten%20Barrow\"&gt;Nimalten Barrow&lt;/a&gt;.\nAera had pursued the cult into the barrow and the Vestige followed suite. It was revealed that Fjora's advisor, &lt;a href=\"Borodin\"&gt;Borodin&lt;/a&gt;, was pulling the strings behind everyone and was responsible for bringing the Worm Cult into Nimalten. Borodin convinced Aera to join him so she could see her dead family once again, so she attempted to assassinate Fjora and killed Golun. The Vestige decided her fate, but it is unknown whether they let her leave or killed her in the barrow. With that out of the way, the Vestige defeated the phantom menace of Nimalten.\nThe Defiled Tomb in Pinepeak.\nThe Worm Cult split into two parties that went towards &lt;a href=\"Ivarstead\"&gt;Ivarstead&lt;/a&gt; and another towards &lt;a href=\"Grethel%27s%20Vigil\"&gt;Grethel's Vigil&lt;/a&gt;, the one towards Ivarstead traveled to the hidden cavern of &lt;a href=\"Pinepeak%20Cavern\"&gt;Pinepeak Cavern&lt;/a&gt;. A group of &lt;a href=\"Mages%20Guild\"&gt;Mages Guild&lt;/a&gt; scholars came to Pinepeak to check on the tomb of &lt;a href=\"Hakra\"&gt;Hakra&lt;/a&gt;, one of &lt;a href=\"Ysgramor\"&gt;Ysgramor&lt;/a&gt;'s Companions. The Worm Cult had forced them out and tried to take the spirit. The Vestige consulted with Hakra who tells them that two urns bind her to Pinepeak. They had to be destroyed to escape from the cult. Eventually, the cult was expelled from Pinepeak and Hakra was freed. She joins the Ebonheart Pact and their fight against the cult and Sinmur.\nUnearthing Taarengrav.\nThe Worm Cult had dug up an ancient Nordic tomb located southwest of Nimalten. &lt;a href=\"Valdur\"&gt;Valdur&lt;/a&gt; of Ysgramor's Companions was buried in the tomb of &lt;a href=\"Taarengrav\"&gt;Taarengrav&lt;/a&gt; which eventually got buried in the Ragged Hills. How the cult knew of its whereabouts are unknown, but regardless, they dug up Taarengrav in a matter of days. The Companions had set up camp on the northern end of the site. &lt;a href=\"Narir\"&gt;Narir&lt;/a&gt; of the Companions ordered the Vestige to enter Taarengrav Barrow and disrupt the ritual that was stealing Valdur's spirit. Inside the barrow, the Vestige unshackled Valdur, preventing the cult from taking his soul. With two members of the original Companions, the Ebonheart Pact is stronger than ever.\nThe Battle of Honrich Tower.\nThe Worm Cult began to terrorize the Rift countryside starting with the &lt;a href=\"Honrich%20Tower%20%28Location%29\"&gt;Honrich Tower&lt;/a&gt; on the &lt;a href=\"Treva%20River\"&gt;Treva River&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href=\"Jorunn%20the%20Skald-King\"&gt;Jorunn the Skald-King&lt;/a&gt; intervenes and begins to fight the Worm Cult. The Vestige had been given the mission to destroy the &lt;a href=\"Daedric\"&gt;Daedric&lt;/a&gt; army being manifested in Honrich. The Pact fought a series of &lt;a href=\"Dremora\"&gt;Dremora&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Harvester\"&gt;Harvester&lt;/a&gt;s while the Vestige closed portals spewing with Daedra. Valdur opened a portal to &lt;a href=\"Arcwind%20Point\"&gt;Arcwind Point&lt;/a&gt; in the Jerall Mountains where &lt;a href=\"Thallik%20Wormfather\"&gt;Thallik Wormfather&lt;/a&gt; of the Worm Cult chapter in Skyrim is performing a ritual with Wuuthrad and Sinmur. The Vestige arrived in the ritual chamber to find that Thallik fused with Sinmur and destroyed Wuuthrad. Wuuthrad would remain broken until the Fourth Era when the Companions in &lt;a href=\"Whiterun\"&gt;Whiterun&lt;/a&gt; would rebuild it to honor their &lt;a href=\"Harbinger%20%28Rank%29\"&gt;Harbinger&lt;/a&gt;.\nIn the Wake of the Giant; Restoring Riften.\nThe abomination of Sinmur and Thallik Wormfather had rampaged across the Smokefrost Peaks. The giant had devastated the city of &lt;a href=\"Riften\"&gt;Riften&lt;/a&gt;. The northern wall had been completely torn down, and the surrounding farms were in flames. The Vestige helped in rebuilding the town and protecting citizens from the damage. &lt;a href=\"Captain%20Viveka\"&gt;Captain Viveka&lt;/a&gt; is suspicious of the Worm Cult in Riften. &lt;a href=\"Anchorite%20Garmar\"&gt;Anchorite Garmar&lt;/a&gt; resurrected &lt;a href=\"zombie\"&gt;zombie&lt;/a&gt;s throughout the city and the Vestige disposed of him and the Zombies. The cult had left a shard of Wuuthrad in Riften. After finding the shard, the Pact seeks pieces in places such as &lt;a href=\"Forelhost\"&gt;Forelhost&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Lost%20Prospect\"&gt;Lost Prospect&lt;/a&gt; Mine. The Vestige then travels to the base of &lt;a href=\"Trolhetta\"&gt;Trolhetta&lt;/a&gt; and prepares to defeat Thallik Wormfather at the battle atop of Trolhetta.\nThe Battle atop of Trolhetta.\nThe Worm Cult had already trekked the mountain from the entrance southeast of Riften. The Ebonheart Pact had camp set up at the base of the mountain. Before climbing the cliff, the wards blocking the way to the summit had to be destroyed. The Vestige destroys the wards, and the battle can commence. With the shards of Wuuthrad, the Pact was able to defeat Sinmur and Thallik Wormfather atop the &lt;a href=\"Trolhetta%20Summit\"&gt;Trolhetta Summit&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href=\"Ysgramor\"&gt;Ysgramor&lt;/a&gt; and his &lt;a href=\"Five%20Hundred%20Companions\"&gt;Five Hundred Companions&lt;/a&gt; came and congratulated the Ebonheart Pact in their victory.\nConstruction of Fort Dawnguard.\nSometime after the Worm Cult threat in the Rift, the son of the &lt;a href=\"Jarl\"&gt;Jarl&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"Riften\"&gt;Riften&lt;/a&gt; contracted &lt;a href=\"Sanguinare%20Vampiris\"&gt;Sanguinare Vampiris&lt;/a&gt; and eventually turned into a &lt;a href=\"Vampire\"&gt;Vampire&lt;/a&gt;. The Jarl could not bear to kill his son, so he spent a fortune building &lt;a href=\"Fort%20Dawnguard\"&gt;Fort Dawnguard&lt;/a&gt; to house his son from the outside world. He hired men to guard the keep; these soldiers eventually became the &lt;a href=\"Dawnguard%20%28Faction%29\"&gt;Dawnguard&lt;/a&gt; militia. Sometime later, the guards were forced to put the Jarl's son down, and because of this, they were banished from ever returning to the Rift. Despite this exile, they continued to fight Vampires across the region until they eventually split up. Fort Dawnguard became an old abandoned castle.\n&lt;a href=\"Third%20Era\"&gt;Third Era&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe Rift and its cities during the Simulacrum.\nDuring the &lt;a href=\"Imperial%20Simulacrum\"&gt;Imperial Simulacrum&lt;/a&gt;, the borders of the Rift were undefined. Many settlements dotted the landscape or at least its general area. These settlements include &lt;a href=\"Reich%20Corigate\"&gt;Reich Corigate&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Sunguard\"&gt;Sunguard&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Greenwall%20%28Arena%29\"&gt;Greenwall&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Nimalten%20City\"&gt;Nimalten City&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Vernim%20Wood%20%28Arena%29\"&gt;Vernim Wood&lt;/a&gt;. At one point, the &lt;a href=\"Eternal%20Champion\"&gt;Eternal Champion&lt;/a&gt; had visited the city of Riften in their quest for a piece of the &lt;a href=\"Staff%20of%20Chaos\"&gt;Staff of Chaos&lt;/a&gt;.\n&lt;a href=\"Fourth%20Era\"&gt;Fourth Era&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe Crossed-Daggers Revolution.\nIn &lt;a href=\"4E%2098\"&gt;4E 98&lt;/a&gt; during the &lt;a href=\"Void%20Nights\"&gt;Void Nights&lt;/a&gt;, the city of Riften was a bustling trade city with people coming from Windhelm from the north and &lt;a href=\"Kragenmoor\"&gt;Kragenmoor&lt;/a&gt; to the east. Mass confusion sprung up when &lt;a href=\"Masser\"&gt;Masser&lt;/a&gt; &amp; &lt;a href=\"Secunda\"&gt;Secunda&lt;/a&gt; disappeared from the night sky. While this was happening, &lt;a href=\"Hosgunn%20Crossed-Daggers\"&gt;Hosgunn Crossed-Daggers&lt;/a&gt; was named Jarl of Riften when the former Jarl was assassinated. Many believed Hosgunn was responsible and people protested on the streets. He used the city guard to quell the protests and installed oppressive order over Riften.\nHosgunn's rule over Riften has put a lot of force on the people of Riften, he imposed heavy, ridiculous taxes on any passerby in Riften including citizens and kept all the gold to himself. He used the gold and built his wooden palace known as &lt;a href=\"Mistveil%20Keep\"&gt;Mistveil Keep&lt;/a&gt; which was coined the name, Hosgunn's Folly. While Hosgunn lived in lavish luxury in his palace, the people of Riften lived in squalor. In &lt;a href=\"4E%20129\"&gt;4E 129&lt;/a&gt;, the people finally revolted. They were able to overwhelm the city guard and set the palace on fire with Hosgunn inside. So ended the reign of Hosgunn Crossed-Daggers.\nThe Crossed-Daggers revolution was a success to a certain extent. The fire from Hosgunn's Folly spread to the rest of the city, and as a result, Riften was in ruins, a shadow of its former self. In the span of five years, Riften was rebuilt into a smaller version of itself. Even after its destruction, Riften slowly thrives although little traffic flows through the city. Much less than before.\nThe Skyrim Civil War; Joining the Stormcloaks.\nIn &lt;a href=\"4E%20201\"&gt;4E 201&lt;/a&gt;, Jarl &lt;a href=\"Ulfric%20Stormcloak%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Ulfric Stormcloak&lt;/a&gt; of Windhelm murdered &lt;a href=\"High%20King\"&gt;High King&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Torygg\"&gt;Torygg&lt;/a&gt; in Solitude and initiated a &lt;a href=\"Skyrim%20Civil%20War\"&gt;civil war&lt;/a&gt; between his private militia known as the &lt;a href=\"Stormcloaks\"&gt;Stormcloaks&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Imperial%20Legion\"&gt;Imperial Legion&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Solitude\"&gt;Solitude&lt;/a&gt;. The Old Holds of Skyrim sided with Windhelm and Eastmarch; this included the Rift. The Jarl of Riften, &lt;a href=\"Laila%20Law-Giver\"&gt;Laila Law-Giver&lt;/a&gt; had little faith in the Stormcloak Rebellion, but her housecarl, &lt;a href=\"Unmid%20Snow-Shod\"&gt;Unmid Snow-Shod&lt;/a&gt; was a firm believer in the Stormcloak cause. &lt;a href=\"Fort%20Greenwall\"&gt;Fort Greenwall&lt;/a&gt; in the north was used as a Stormcloak stronghold.\nThe Way of the Voice; Pilgrimage to High Hrothgar.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Last%20Dragonborn\"&gt;Last Dragonborn&lt;/a&gt; was revealed to be alive after absorbing a &lt;a href=\"Dragons%20%28Lore%29\"&gt;Dragons&lt;/a&gt; soul near the city of &lt;a href=\"Whiterun\"&gt;Whiterun&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href=\"The%20Greybeards\"&gt;The Greybeards&lt;/a&gt; atop of &lt;a href=\"High%20Hrothgar%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;High Hrothgar&lt;/a&gt; called the Dragonborn from the monastery and it echoed all over Skyrim. The Dragonborn traveled to &lt;a href=\"Ivarstead\"&gt;Ivarstead&lt;/a&gt; to begin the pilgrimage to High Hrothgar. After trekking &lt;a href=\"The%20Seven%20Thousand%20Steps\"&gt;The Seven Thousand Steps&lt;/a&gt;, the Dragonborn met the Greybeards, and they taught them the way of the &lt;a href=\"Thu%27um\"&gt;Voice&lt;/a&gt;. With the guidance of the Greybeards, the Dragonborn was able to defeat &lt;a href=\"Alduin\"&gt;Alduin&lt;/a&gt;, the World-Eater.\nEmerging from the Ratways; Enter the Thieves Guild.\nDespite her position as Jarl, Laila Law-Giver did not have great control over Riften. The &lt;a href=\"Thieves%20Guild\"&gt;Thieves Guild&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Maven%20Black-Briar\"&gt;Maven Black-Briar&lt;/a&gt; of the &lt;a href=\"Black-Briars\"&gt;Black-Briar Clan&lt;/a&gt; had a significant influence on the city although, at that time, the Thieves Guild was not as successful as before. Eventually, the Thieves Guild had influence in places such as Solitude, &lt;a href=\"Markarth\"&gt;Markarth&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Whiterun\"&gt;Whiterun&lt;/a&gt;. Many of Maven's competitors were put out of business like the &lt;a href=\"Honningbrew%20Meadery\"&gt;Honningbrew Meadery&lt;/a&gt; and people who decided to quit working for Maven were killed like the people in &lt;a href=\"Goldenglow%20Estate\"&gt;Goldenglow Estate&lt;/a&gt; on the &lt;a href=\"Isle%20of%20Gold\"&gt;Isle of Gold&lt;/a&gt;. The Thieves Guild had a firm grip on the Black Market, and Maven's &lt;a href=\"Black-Briar%20Meadery\"&gt;Black-Briar Meadery&lt;/a&gt; was a booming success.\nThe Reformed Dawnguard.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Volkihar%20Clan\"&gt;Volkihar Clan&lt;/a&gt; of vampires have begun to emerge throughout Skyrim to the point it became concerning. In the Pale, the &lt;a href=\"Hall%20of%20the%20Vigilant\"&gt;Hall of the Vigilant&lt;/a&gt; was a group of Daedra Hunters that worship &lt;a href=\"Stendarr\"&gt;Stendarr&lt;/a&gt;, the God of Righteous Mercy. &lt;a href=\"Isran\"&gt;Isran&lt;/a&gt; of the Vigilant decided to leave the Vigilant and reformed the Dawnguard in the abandoned &lt;a href=\"Fort%20Dawnguard\"&gt;Fort Dawnguard&lt;/a&gt;. Sometime later, the Hall of the Vigilant was destroyed by the Volkihar Clan. The Last Dragonborn joined the Dawnguard and helped the Dawnguard militia grow to nation level."}

Major settlements include &lt;a href=\"Riften%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Riften&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Nimalten\"&gt;Nimalten&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Shor%27s%20Stone%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Shor's Stone&lt;/a&gt;, among many other settlements dotted throughout the hold such as &lt;a href=\"Ivarstead%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Ivarstead&lt;/a&gt;.\nBackground.\nThe Rift is a relatively temperate, autumnal region, protected from the frigid gales of the &lt;a href=\"Sea%20of%20Ghosts\"&gt;Sea of Ghosts&lt;/a&gt; by the northern mountains and is warmed by the &lt;a href=\"Velothi%20Mountains\"&gt;Velothi Mountains&lt;/a&gt; to the east. Its capital is &lt;a href=\"Riften%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Riften&lt;/a&gt;, on the eastern shore of broad &lt;a href=\"Lake%20Honrich\"&gt;Lake Honrich&lt;/a&gt;. Many crafters and traders frequently visit the city due to its compactness and the fact that most trading facilities are in close proximity to each other.\nThe Rift is located in the southeastern corner of &lt;a href=\"Skyrim%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Skyrim&lt;/a&gt; and borders &lt;a href=\"Stonefalls%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Stonefalls&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Morrowind%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Morrowind&lt;/a&gt; to the east, &lt;a href=\"Cyrodiil%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Cyrodiil&lt;/a&gt; to the south, &lt;a href=\"Eastmarch%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Eastmarch&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Whiterun%20Hold\"&gt;Whiterun&lt;/a&gt; to the north and northwest, and &lt;a href=\"Falkreath%20Hold\"&gt;Falkreath&lt;/a&gt; to the west.\nMost of the Rift is composed of lush, autumnal valleys and river basins, surrounded by mountains to the south, east, west and northeast. The hold itself is located atop a large vertical ridge that separates it from Eastmarch, and the western mountain range south of &lt;a href=\"Throat%20of%20the%20World%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Throat of the World&lt;/a&gt; goes along its border with Falkreath, making it one of the most isolated holds in Skyrim. In fact, there are only two known roads that lead into other zones: the one at &lt;a href=\"Fort%20Virak\"&gt;Fort Virak&lt;/a&gt; in Stonefalls and the one in Eastmarch.\nThe Rift is teeming with wildlife, both docile and hostile. It serves as an excellent hunting ground due to the presence of so much wildlife. &lt;a href=\"Bear%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Bears&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Sabre%20Cat%20%28Online%29\"&gt;sabre cats&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Wolf%20%28Online%29\"&gt;wolves&lt;/a&gt; are common in the wilderness, and &lt;a href=\"Mammoth%20%28Online%29\"&gt;mammoths&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Giant%20%28Online%29\"&gt;giants&lt;/a&gt; also appear regularly.\nLocations.\nThe following are locations accessible in the Rift and, with the exception of &lt;a href=\"Unmarked%20Locations%20%28Online%29\"&gt;unmarked locations&lt;/a&gt;, are discoverable on the map. Points of Interest serve as locations with unique side quests, while &lt;a href=\"Cities%20%28Online%29\"&gt;cities&lt;/a&gt; serve as the centralized areas with multiple sublocations and act as a hub for services and &lt;a href=\"Merchants%20%28Online%29\"&gt;merchants&lt;/a&gt;. Explanations of the types of locations are provided in the &lt;a href=\"Locations%20%28Online%29%23Types\"&gt;main locations page&lt;/a&gt;.\nQuests.\nThe Rift features a series of zone story quests and unrelated side quests. The zone story quests conclude the Ebonheart Pact's overarching storyline and carries on from &lt;a href=\"Eastmarch%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Eastmarch&lt;/a&gt;, but it is not necessary to complete the story quests for zones prior to those in the Rift. Side quests are non-sequential and can be completed in any order, except where one carries on from another, and &lt;a href=\"repeatable%20quests\"&gt;repeatable quests&lt;/a&gt; can be completed multiple times: weekly for arenas and trials and daily for all others. Pointer quests are optional zone quests that send the Vestige to the tarting location of another zone quest.\nItem Sets.\nItem sets are related armor and weapons that, when worn together, provide unique benefits. Overland sets can be acquired from world bosses, world events, delves, public dungeons and containers and as quest rewards; dungeon sets can be acquired from within group dungeons; monster sets can be acquired from the final boss of veteran group dungeons and Undaunted Enclaves; and crafted sets can be created at specific locations across the zone.\nSkyshards.\nSixteen Skyshards can be found in the Rift totaling in five &lt;a href=\"skill%20points\"&gt;skill points&lt;/a&gt; with one left over. The zone guide provides clues as to the location of each Skyshard, but many can be found simply by exploring and watching for the distinctive pillar of light they emit. Skyshards will appear on the map and compass when the Vestige is close to one and will remain discovered on the map even if it was not collected.\nAchievements.\nAchievements can be earned by completing specific tasks such as completing quests and discovering locations. Achievements are separated into categories and their progress is viewable from the journal. Earning achievement provides the Vestige a number of points, and some achievements unlock unique rewards such as &lt;a href=\"Furnishings%20%28Online%29\"&gt;furnishings&lt;/a&gt; that can be bought from Achievement Furnishers or &lt;a href=\"collectibles\"&gt;collectibles&lt;/a&gt;.\nShalidor's Library.\nTwenty-nine books that are a part of Shalidor's Library can be found in the Rift and added to the collection. Books that have already been found in other zones will already be marked as completed in the zone tracker.\nFish.\nFish can be caught from fishing hotspots, ideally with the correct &lt;a href=\"bait\"&gt;bait&lt;/a&gt;. Common fish will be caught most often while rare fish and alternative bait are rare catches. Each zone has unique rare fish than can be caught from hotspots. &lt;a href=\"Slaughterfish%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Slaughterfish&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"trodh\"&gt;trodh&lt;/a&gt; can be caught from foul hotspots, &lt;a href=\"dhufish\"&gt;dhufish&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"longfin\"&gt;longfin&lt;/a&gt; can be caught from saltwater hotspots, &lt;a href=\"silverside%20perch\"&gt;silverside perch&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"spadetail\"&gt;spadetail&lt;/a&gt; can be caught from lake hotspots, and &lt;a href=\"Salmon%20%28Online%29\"&gt;salmon&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"River%20Betty%20%28Online%29\"&gt;river betty&lt;/a&gt; can be caught from river hotspots. &lt;a href=\"Chub\"&gt;Chub&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"minnow\"&gt;minnow&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"shad\"&gt;shad&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"fish%20roe\"&gt;fish roe&lt;/a&gt; can be caught and used as bait from foul, saltwater, lake and river hotspots, respectively."}

It is one of the four oldest holds in Skyrim, known collectively as &lt;a href=\"Old%20Holds\"&gt;Old Holds&lt;/a&gt;. Major settlements include &lt;a href=\"Riften%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Riften&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Ivarstead%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Ivarstead&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Shor%27s%20Stone%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Shor's Stone&lt;/a&gt;. Its coat of arms is two crossed daggers. Its capital city, Riften, is home to the &lt;a href=\"Thieves%20Guild%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Thieves Guild&lt;/a&gt;.\nGeography.\nThe Rift is located around the southeastern corner of Skyrim and borders &lt;a href=\"Morrowind\"&gt;Morrowind&lt;/a&gt; to the east and &lt;a href=\"Cyrodiil\"&gt;Cyrodiil&lt;/a&gt; to the south. The surrounding holds are &lt;a href=\"Eastmarch%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Eastmarch&lt;/a&gt; to the north, &lt;a href=\"Whiterun%20Hold\"&gt;Whiterun&lt;/a&gt; to the northwest and &lt;a href=\"Falkreath%20Hold%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Falkreath&lt;/a&gt; to the west. Much of the Rift is composed of lush, autumn-colored valleys and rivers, surrounded by mountains to the south, east, and northeast. The Rift itself is located atop an immense plateau that clearly separates it from Eastmarch, and the western mountain range south of &lt;a href=\"Throat%20of%20the%20World%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Throat of the World&lt;/a&gt; goes along its border with Falkreath, making it one of the most isolated holds in Skyrim, even more so perhaps than &lt;a href=\"Winterhold%20%28Skyrim%20Hold%29\"&gt;Winterhold&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"The%20Reach\"&gt;The Reach&lt;/a&gt;. As a result, its main stronghold, &lt;a href=\"Fort%20Greenwall%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Fort Greenwall&lt;/a&gt;, lies just north of Riften, between it and &lt;a href=\"Shor%27s%20Stone%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Shor's Stone&lt;/a&gt; further north of that.\nWildlife.\nThe Rift is teeming with wildlife, both docile and hostile. It serves as an excellent hunting ground, and as such encounters with hunters and poachers are common. &lt;a href=\"Bear%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Bears&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Sabre%20Cat%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Sabre Cats&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Frostbite%20Spider%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Frostbite Spiders&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Wolf%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;wolves&lt;/a&gt; make a common practice of hiding in the foliage and ambushing unsuspecting travelers. All of these combined can make traversing the Rift very arduous and time-consuming, even potentially dangerous for low-leveled players.\nIn addition, the dense forest and uneven terrain make landing spots for &lt;a href=\"Dragons%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;dragons&lt;/a&gt; few and far between, meaning that, even if a dragon were to appear, one may not get a chance to kill it throughout most of the region, as it will fly away shortly after spawning. Trolls are not uncommon here, either."}

Small mattocks are not made for clawed hands, not when they formed from the only tools available.\nRust-colored liquid seeped from the piles of slag, staining everyone's scales a dusky orange. Huusmaheem crawled forward a few feet, dragging his baskets behind him, so he could pull apart a new section of earth and rock. The miners tapped apart rocks and sifted through the mud for the rich variety of reagents found in those oozing mounds.\nThe miner beside him said, \"Finished my eighth basket.

Huusmaheem ducked a right hook, still clutching a basket to his chest. He had to get to the village and warn people. Ogres hadn't been seen near the mines in at least twelve months.\nHe scrambled forward. Realizing he still held a basket, he flung it away, so he could use both hands. A brute stronger than Huusmaheem grabbed his tail and pulled him backwards. And then it let out a scream of rage and pain as Split-Tail swung his proper-sized mattock into the ogre's hand.\n\"Run!\" Split-Tail cried."}

There are fewer that can pass down and tell their stories, their origins and their downfall. My father could. In his proudest moments he said to me, \"You keep secrets like the Blades.\"\nThe Blades were very good at keeping secrets. They hardly wrote down information. They normally passed information carefully between their spies in every province, to their elite members that protected the Emperors. Even amongst their members, they kept much secret.\nMost associate the Blades with their ceremonial &lt;a href=\"Akaviri\"&gt;Akaviri&lt;/a&gt; armor and curved longswords. One can trace the Blades back to the fiercest warriors of Akavir, the &lt;a href=\"Dragonguard\"&gt;Dragonguard&lt;/a&gt;. It was there, just as they would do in &lt;a href=\"Tamriel\"&gt;Tamriel&lt;/a&gt;, that they protected rulers and their kingdom. But recent discoveries show it to be much more than that.\nMany classic texts tell us of adventures to Akavir, known as the dragon lands of the east. Many from Tamriel have attempted to conquer it, most famously Emperor &lt;a href=\"Uriel%20V\"&gt;Uriel V&lt;/a&gt; and his &lt;a href=\"Tenth%20Legion\"&gt;Tenth Legion&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"3E%20288\"&gt;3E288&lt;/a&gt; as documented in the &lt;a href=\"Imperial\"&gt;Imperial&lt;/a&gt; dispatch \".\" &lt;a href=\"Dragons%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Dragons&lt;/a&gt; have long been legend in Akavir, and many believe that their brief appearance in Tamriel's history are those that escaped Akaviri, for it was there they were hunted and killed off by the Dragonguard. The Dragonguard would follow those that fled to Tamriel in the late &lt;a href=\"First%20Era\"&gt;1st Era&lt;/a&gt;.\nInvading from the north, the Dragonguard met not only dragons, but the men of &lt;a href=\"Skyrim\"&gt;Skyrim&lt;/a&gt;, who don't meet invasions with pitchers of mead. The Dragonguard cut a path through Skyrim, and it was not until they were stopped by &lt;a href=\"Reman%20Cyrodiil\"&gt;Reman Cyrodiil&lt;/a&gt; during the &lt;a href=\"Battle%20of%20Pale%20Pass\"&gt;battle at Pale Pass&lt;/a&gt; that the invasion came to an end. It was Reman who united the human lands of &lt;a href=\"Cyrodiil\"&gt;Cyrodiil&lt;/a&gt; and defeated the Akaviri invaders.\nReman is one of the first documented, and widely accepted, of the mythic Dragonborn; those anointed by &lt;a href=\"Akatosh\"&gt;Akatosh&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Alessia\"&gt;Alessia&lt;/a&gt; themselves. \"Born with the soul of a dragon\" is what his followers would say. Reports differ widely on the nature of the battle at Pale Pass. But the end result is the same, that the remaining Dragonguard, upon hearing the voice of &lt;a href=\"Reman%20Cyrodiil\"&gt;Reman Cyrodiil&lt;/a&gt;, knelt and swore their lives to him, their conqueror and savior. Fragments of from late &lt;a href=\"First%20Era\"&gt;1st era&lt;/a&gt; texts refer to the warriors dropping to their knees saying \"we were not hunting\" (or \"did not intend\", author - rough translation), continuing \"we have been searching, for you.\"\nThey protected Reman with their lives, as well as his descendants, as the &lt;a href=\"Reman%20Dynasty\"&gt;Reman Dynasty&lt;/a&gt; ushered in Tamriel's &lt;a href=\"Second%20Era\"&gt;2nd era&lt;/a&gt;. It was through these years that their reach extended, and their order grew to become the Blades. Their conquest of the dragons complete, they only sought to protect the &lt;a href=\"Dragonborn%20%28Lore%29\"&gt;Dragonborn&lt;/a&gt;, and through him, the &lt;a href=\"Empire\"&gt;Empire&lt;/a&gt;.\nThey reached their height late during the &lt;a href=\"Third%20Era\"&gt;3rd era&lt;/a&gt; under the rule of the Septim emprors [sic]. Despite their numbers, they kept their secrecy. The most visible and well documented were the members who personally guarded the Emperor, still wearing the original Akaviri armor. But that was the just the tip of the spear, for the Blades were a larger organization, stretching to every corner of Tamriel. These agents were of every race. They were &lt;a href=\"merchant\"&gt;merchant&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"Thief%20%28Class%29\"&gt;thieves&lt;/a&gt;, craftsman, &lt;a href=\"Mage%20%28Class%29\"&gt;mages&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"warrior\"&gt;warrior&lt;/a&gt;s, all acting as spies, protecting the Empire as needed, and operating in secret. They often acted alone, but some fragments speak of them meeting in secret fortresses across the continent. The most famous being Cyrodiil's &lt;a href=\"Cloud%20Ruler%20Temple\"&gt;Cloud Ruler Temple&lt;/a&gt;, where they hung the swords of those slain protecting the Dragonborn. Other maps speak of &lt;a href=\"Wind%20Scour%20Temple\"&gt;Wind Scour Temple&lt;/a&gt; under the great expanse of &lt;a href=\"Hammerfell\"&gt;Hammerfell's&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Alik%27r%20Desert\"&gt;Alik'r desert&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Sky%20Haven%20Temple\"&gt;Sky Haven Temple&lt;/a&gt; in the mountains of &lt;a href=\"Skyrim\"&gt;Skyrim&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Storm%20Talon%20Temple\"&gt;Storm Talon Temple&lt;/a&gt; east of &lt;a href=\"Wayrest\"&gt;Wayrest&lt;/a&gt;.\nThey were known to have a \"&lt;a href=\"Grandmaster\"&gt;Grandmaster&lt;/a&gt;\", who often lived amongst the people, unknown to others. The nature of their communications, meeting places, and missions were known to only a few elite members. The only two to know all were the Grandmaster himself and the Chronicler, whose only job was to make sure the group's mission was never known, but never lost.\nWith the death of &lt;a href=\"Uriel%20Septim%20VII\"&gt;Uriel Septim VII&lt;/a&gt; and his son, &lt;a href=\"Martin%20Septim\"&gt;Martin&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"Third%20Era\"&gt;3rd era&lt;/a&gt; came to a close with the Blades fortifying themselves deep within Cyrodiil's Cloud Ruler Temple, as they waited for a Dragonborn to return when they would be called upon again.\nThe Empire of the &lt;a href=\"Fourth%20Era\"&gt;4th era&lt;/a&gt; no longer saw the Blades openly protecting it, or the Emperors. That role is now filled by the &lt;a href=\"Penitus%20Oculatus%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Penitus Oculatus&lt;/a&gt;, a purely Imperial organization. But the Blades continued their secret work, to watch for the Dragonborn and guard against future enemies. The Blades were among the first to see the signs that the &lt;a href=\"Thalmor%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Thalmor&lt;/a&gt; of the &lt;a href=\"Aldmeri%20Dominion%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Aldmeri Dominion&lt;/a&gt; would not remain isolated within their borders forever. They could do what the Penitus Oculatus, servant to Imperial policy, could not, and thus earned the lasting hatred of the Thalmor.\nThe warnings of the Blades were proved right, as is well known to all. The Great War between the Empire and the Thalmor consumed the Empire and nearly destroyed it. Emperor &lt;a href=\"Titus%20Mede%20II\"&gt;Titus Mede II&lt;/a&gt; eventually brokered peace with the Thalmor, but at a price many of us still bear.\nThe reach and destructive nature of the Thalmor is known to many (author's note - in my family firsthand). They are not fools. They knew early on that the Blades were an enemy. So they hunted them throughout the Great War. Some were killed defending their Temples, others as they slept in their hideaways, alone. Some fought, some ran, some hid. But the Thalmor found them all.\nThere are those that say the Blades still exist around us, in hiding from the Thalmor. Waiting as they have done time and time again, for a Dragonborn to return. For one to protect, for one to guide them."}

No scholars agree on who founded the town, but we do know Cormount's population and cultural significance grew tenfold shortly before the end of the Long Truce.\nCormount's quiet surroundings and distance from the &lt;a href=\"Bosmer%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Wood Elf&lt;/a&gt; seat of power made it an ideal hideaway, especially for the &lt;a href=\"Camoran%20Dynasty\"&gt;Camoran&lt;/a&gt; factions. Over the years the cream of the Bosmer nobility took lovers in Cormount. But secrets are like seeds\u2014if you try to bury them, they will one day burst forth.\nIn &lt;a href=\"2E%20406\"&gt;2E 406&lt;/a&gt;, a scandal rocked the Camoran factions when it was revealed that Cormount might be the source of dozens upon dozens of potential heirs, most of whom were of marriageable age. Cormount nearly doubled its population in one week as opportunists, the curious, and the cunning arrived in town. For months thereafter, weddings were a daily occurrence.\nThis rumor also drew many young Wood Elves who lived outside of &lt;a href=\"Valenwood%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Valenwood&lt;/a&gt;. They traveled to the Kingdom of &lt;a href=\"Grahtwood\"&gt;Grahtwood&lt;/a&gt; with the hopes of binding their Imperial fortunes to their spiritual home. Those who found Grahtwood agreeable founded a ramshackle village near Cormount called New Joy.\nThe settlers were known as \"migrants\" by the Grahtwood natives who had first arrived in Cormount. These adherents to the &lt;a href=\"Green%20Pact\"&gt;Green Pact&lt;/a&gt; were shocked by the Cyrodiilic customs of their wayward cousins. Meanwhile, the migrants flaunted the \"backwoods\" nature of the natives, seeking easy pleasures in the trade that flowed through Cormount.\nTensions between Cormount and New Joy grew to a boiling point in the years to follow. It is unknown who cast the first torch, but one dark night in &lt;a href=\"2E%20420\"&gt;2E 420&lt;/a&gt; the settlement of &lt;a href=\"New%20Joy\"&gt;New Joy&lt;/a&gt; was burned to the ground. Those who fled were slain\u2014including a visiting Camoran noble.\nThough none took credit for this massacre, it was widely assumed the work of Green Pact adherents of Cormount. In the few short years before the end of the Long Truce, Camorans looking to air their grievances frequently used the &lt;a href=\"Razing%20of%20New%20Joy\"&gt;Razing of New Joy&lt;/a&gt; as a political cudgel.\nBut Cormount should not be known for this one stain on its reputation. Founded in &lt;a href=\"2E%20489\"&gt;2E 489&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"Blacksap%20Rebellion\"&gt;Blacksap&lt;/a&gt; Movement has grown in popularity throughout Grahtwood. This Cormount-based cultural organization hopes to formalize the Wood Elf approach to the Green Pact, thereby preventing the very misunderstandings that led to the tragic events of New Joy. As we enter the fifth century of our era, Cormount's rise seems all but assured. This author can only hope the Blacksap rises with it!"}

Read, that you might welcome our Queen into your hearts.\nHer Majesty spent early days as many children do in the Isles. She trained in blades beside her father. She rode horses in the surf along our golden beaches, and memorized history and sonnets beneath soft pink petals.\nOver twenty years ago, your forward-thinking King\u2014His Royal Majesty King &lt;a href=\"Hidellith\"&gt;Hidellith&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"Alinor\"&gt;Alinor&lt;/a&gt;, may he be ever honored in &lt;a href=\"Aetherius\"&gt;Aetherius&lt;/a&gt;\u2014gathered with the royal family at the &lt;a href=\"Crystal%20Tower%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Crystal Tower&lt;/a&gt; in celebration of Her Majesty's passage into the Labyrinth. This time of intensive study had been required by all Summerset rulers in the past, and Her Majesty was to step into that period with arms wide. As the hour approached, however, the then-princess was found missing!\nWhile a long search was begun, in truth, Her Majesty had claimed her own destiny. Her Majesty had stolen away to the &lt;a href=\"Isle%20of%20Balfiera%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Isle of Balfiera&lt;/a&gt;, to live with the &lt;a href=\"Direnni%20Bloodline\"&gt;Direnni&lt;/a&gt; at the &lt;a href=\"Adamant%20Tower\"&gt;Adamant Tower&lt;/a&gt;. The members of that clan trained her in the art of war. They turned her simple noble swordplay to lithe and seasoned blade-dancing. Her beachside rides became forced marches on horseback, and her singing of sonnets beneath the trees of her homeland gave way to the study of the arts most arcane.\nMuch has been made of our Queen's adventures in &lt;a href=\"Tamriel\"&gt;Tamriel&lt;/a&gt; by bards and common broadsheet scribes. Yes, it's true that she once rode a bear. That she hunted the frost trolls of &lt;a href=\"Skyrim%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Skyrim&lt;/a&gt;, delved into the depths of a &lt;a href=\"Dwemer%20Ruins%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Dwarven ruin&lt;/a&gt;, and crewed with a pirate captain of &lt;a href=\"Cyrodiil%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Cyrodiil&lt;/a&gt;. Her Majesty once flew upon an enormous kite on the winds of the &lt;a href=\"Alik%27r%20Desert%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Alik'r Desert&lt;/a&gt;, and danced with &lt;a href=\"Nereid%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Nereids&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;a href=\"Illessan%20Hills\"&gt;Illessan Hills&lt;/a&gt;. These adventures were not the larks of a wanton, but instead a deliberate process. The tempering of a blade!\nAnd when His Majesty King Hidellith passed away, when it looked as though our remote isles would be left to flounder in the swell of history, Princess Ayrenn returned! Her Majesty plucked the crown from where it had fallen in the dust. She took up her father's sword, and led us out into the world.\nLed us into the world to find new allies waiting just off our shores! The Queen's connections to the noble Wood Elves and fierce Khajiit enabled us to form the mighty Dominion that now stands astride our corner of Tamriel, poised to strike at the dark heart of Cyrodiil and ward off the depredations of the warmongering alliances of the north.\nThough she has her detractors, and cowards defame her courage from behind a veil, Queen Ayrenn is the living, beating heart of the Dominion. Our fortune and prosperty depend upon her."}

Find the seed and plant the First Tree.\"\n\"Aevar traveled again through the Hirstaang Forest, searching for the seeds of the First Tree, but he could find none. Then he spoke to the Tree Spirits, the living trees. They told him that the seeds had been stolen by one of the Falmer (for they are the servants of the Adversary), and this Falmer was hiding them deep in the forest, so that none would ever find them. Aevar traveled to the deepest part of the forest, and there he found the evil Falmer, surrounded by the Lesser Tree Spirits. Aevar could see that the Spirits were in his thrall, that he had used the magic of the Seeds and spoken their secret name. Aevar knew he could not stand against such a force, and that he must retrieve the seeds in secret. Aevar reached into his pouch and drew out his flint. Gathering leaves, he started a small fire outside the clearing where the Falmer and the ensorcelled Spirits milled. All the Skaal know the Spirits' hatred of fires, for the fires ravage the trees they serve. At once, the Nature of the Spirits took hold, and they rushed to quell the flames. During the commotion, Aevar snuck behind the Falmer and snatched the pouch of Seeds, stealing away before the evil being knew they were gone.\"\n\"When Aevar returned to the Tree Stone, he planted the tree in the ground, and the All-Maker spoke to him.\"\n\"The Gift of Trees is restored. Once again, the Trees and Plants will bloom and grow, and provide nourishment and shade.\"\nWalkthrough.\nThe Tree Stone.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Tree%20Stone%20%28Bloodmoon%29\"&gt;Tree Stone&lt;/a&gt; is a dark grey and tall pillar and it can be found in the center of &lt;a href=\"Solstheim%20%28Bloodmoon%29\"&gt;Solstheim&lt;/a&gt;, north of &lt;a href=\"Brodir%20Grove%20%28Bloodmoon%29\"&gt;Brodir Grove&lt;/a&gt;. After activating the stone, the Nerevarine receives a message, \"The First Trees are gone. Travel east and find the one who has stolen the Seeds. Beware--he who has the seeds, controls the trees. Plant the First anew.\" They must, now, travel east and find the culprit, who has stolen the seeds.\nThe riekling and the spriggans.\nJust east of the stone should be a &lt;a href=\"Riekling%20%28Bloodmoon%29\"&gt;Riekling&lt;/a&gt; surrounded by five &lt;a href=\"Spriggan%20%28Bloodmoon%29\"&gt;Spriggans&lt;/a&gt;. They will attack the Nerevarine. Spriggans have a natural ability to die three times, thus they must, each, be killed three times. This may become a relatively challenging battle. Once the Riekling has been killed, the &lt;a href=\"Strange%20Seeds\"&gt;Strange Seeds&lt;/a&gt; may be retrieved from its corpse. The Spriggans won't attack anyone who is holding the Strange Seeds.\nRestoring the Tree Stone.\nAfter returning to the Tree Stone, the Nerevarine will receive instrctions to plant the seed not far from the stone. There, some stones can be seen, just left of the Tree Stone, between these stones there is a patch of fertile soil, this is where the seeds must be planted.\nThe Nerevarine may return to the stone and activate it to complete this quest."}

The Swimmer dove into the waters and swam very far, and far again. Aevar was strong, though, and he swam hard. He followed the Swimmer to a cave, swimming deeper and deeper, his lungs burning and his limbs exhausted. At last, he found a pocket of air, and there, in the dark, he found the Waters of Life. Gathering his strength, he took the Waters and swam back to the shore. Upon returning to the Water Stone, the All-Maker spoke.\"\n\"You have returned the Gift of Water to the Skaal.

His legs were weary and his eyes heavy, but he continued on, traveling to the Sun Stone. Again, the All-Maker spoke.\"\n\"The gentle warmth of the Sun is stolen, so now it only burns. Free the Sun from the Halls of Penumbra.\"\n\"And so Aevar walked west, over the frozen lands until he reached the Halls of Penumbra. The air inside was thick and heavy, and he could see no farther than the end of his arm. Still, he felt his way along the walls, though he heard the shuffling of feet and knew that this place held the Unholy Beasts who would tear his flesh and eat his bones. For hours he crept along, until he saw a faint glow far at the end of the hall. There, from behind a sheet of perfect ice, came a glow so bright he had to shut his eyes, lest they be forever blinded. He plucked the flaming eye from one of the Unholy Beasts and threw it at the ice with all his might. A small crack appeared in the ice, then grew larger. Slowly, the light crept out between the cracks, widening them, splitting the ice wall into pieces. With a deafening crack, the wall crumbled, and the light rushed over Aevar and through the Halls. He heard the shrieks of the Unholy Beasts as they were blinded and burned. He ran out of the Halls, following the light, and collapsed on the ground outside. When he was able to rise again, the Sun again warmed him, and he was glad for that. He traveled back to the Sun Stone, where the All-Maker spoke to him.\"\n\"The Gift of the Sun is the Skaal's once again. It will warm them and give them light.\"\nWalkthrough.\nThe sun stone.\nThe sun stone is located in the southeastern region of &lt;a href=\"Solstheim%20%28Bloodmoon%29\"&gt;Solstheim&lt;/a&gt;, south of the &lt;a href=\"Skogsdrake%20Barrow\"&gt;Skogsdrake Barrow&lt;/a&gt;, and northeast of &lt;a href=\"Fort%20Frostmoth%20%28Bloodmoon%29\"&gt;Fort Frostmoth&lt;/a&gt;.

While exploring the cavern, the Hero will receive a journal entry about a light source. The light source will be at the end of the tunnel, there, the dwelling of the unique lightkeeper grahl can be found. The &lt;a href=\"grahl\"&gt;grahl&lt;/a&gt; must be defeated and the Flaming Eye of the Lightkeeper looted from its corpse. The bright ice wall must be activated.

He looked in the trees, but the Greedy Man did not hide there. Nor did he hide near the oceans, or the deep caves, and the beasts had not seen him in the dark forests. Finally, Aevar came to a crooked house, and he knew that here he would find the Greedy Man. \"Who are you,\" shouted the Greedy Man, \"that you would come to my house?\" \"I am Aevar of the Skaal,\" said Aevar. \"I am not warrior, shaman, or elder. If I do not return, I will not be missed. But I have returned the Oceans and the Earth, the Trees, the Beasts, and the Sun, and I will return the Winds to my people, that we may feel the spirit of the All-Maker in our souls again.\" And with that, he grabbed up the Greedy Man's bag and tore it open. The Winds rushed out with gale force, sweeping the Greedy Man up and carrying him off, far from the island. Aevar breathed in the Winds and was glad. He walked back to the Wind Stone, where the All-Maker spoke to him a final time.\"\n\"You have done well, Aevar. You, the least of the Skaal, have returned my gifts to them.

One would need to rebuild the &lt;a href=\"Staff%20of%20Sheogorath\"&gt;Staff of Sheogorath&lt;/a&gt; before that was possible, however. So they have successfully rebuilt the staff, and now they are ready to recharge it in the &lt;a href=\"Sheogorath%27s%20Palace\"&gt;Palace's&lt;/a&gt; Font of Madness. Finding it overgrown in Order Crystals, speak to Haskill.\nWalkthrough.\nHaskill tells the Hero that Jyggalag has poisoned the font by fouling the pools of Mania and Dementia below the fountain itself. The pools are where the insanity of the Shivering Isles' inhabitants settles. They will need to clear both the Pool of &lt;a href=\"Mania\"&gt;Mania&lt;/a&gt; and the Pool of &lt;a href=\"Dementia\"&gt;Dementia&lt;/a&gt; before one can finish crafting the Staff of Sheogorath.\nFountainhead.\nThe entrance to the Fountainhead is behind the throne. The &lt;a href=\"Gnarl%20Cultivator\"&gt;Gnarl Cultivator&lt;/a&gt;s that inhabit the Fountainhead are tame and will not attack. However, you will also encounter standard &lt;a href=\"Gnarl\"&gt;Gnarl&lt;/a&gt;s that will need to be dispatched before you can proceed. Hostile Gnarls can be identified by their\u00a0blueish-silver glow.\nIn Fountainhead there are several small pools with a\u00a0&lt;a href=\"Priest%20of%20Order\"&gt;Priest of Order&lt;/a&gt; guarding them and they are actively poisoning. Kill them and take their Shards of Order. The Shards are used to break the seals on certain root doors in the Fountainhead as well as some crystal covered hollowed tree stumps.\nHowever, if they don't have any Shards one can usually go to the side of the door into a small chamber. Hanging above is a Gnarl Chrysalis, activate this and a Gnarl Cultivator will pop out and then proceed to walk to the door and destroy the order crystals on it.\nPool of Mania.\nOnce the Hero has two Shards, follow the arrows to the two main pools: the Pool of Mania and the Pool of Dementia. These pools are defended by more Priests of Order. They will find &lt;a href=\"Lord%20Thadon\"&gt;Lord Thadon&lt;/a&gt; here wearing his unique helm\u2014the &lt;a href=\"Diadem%20of%20Euphoria\"&gt;Diadem of Euphoria&lt;/a&gt;.\nFight the Priests and take their Shards, they are needed to shut the large &lt;a href=\"Obelisk%20of%20Order\"&gt;Obelisk&lt;/a&gt; in the middle. Attack and fight Thadon until he is killed, don't forget to take his helm and continue to the Pool of Dementia.\nPool of Dementia.\nArriving at the Pool of Dementia there are several Priests of Order guarding and if the Hero is Duke of Mania they will find &lt;a href=\"Lady%20Syl\"&gt;Lady Syl&lt;/a&gt; waiting on the stairs. Syl will use the unique levelled Amber\u00a0Warhammer\u00a0&lt;a href=\"Nerveshatter%20%28Shivering%20Isles%29\"&gt;Nerveshatter&lt;/a&gt;.\nFight the Priests and Syl, take their Shards if needed and once Syl is dead, her body can be looted for her enchanted warhammer Nerveshatter.\u00a0\nThadon will only appear during this quest unless the Hero has decided to become the Duke/Duchess of Mania, and that they have killed him to take up his position as ruler of Mania.\nSyl will only appear during this quest unless the Hero has decided to become the Duke/Duchess of Dementia and, that they have killed her to take up his position as ruler of Dementia.\nThe Throne Room.\nOnce both pools are restored, it is time to return to the Throne Room. The crystals from the Font of Madness will be gone, and activating it will give the Hero the fully-functional &lt;a href=\"Staff%20of%20Sheogorath\"&gt;Staff of Sheogorath&lt;/a&gt;. This can be recharged at any time at the Font of Madness.\nThis will end the current quest and begin the final quest, \"&lt;a href=\"The%20End%20of%20Order\"&gt;The End of Order&lt;/a&gt;.\""}

One after another, Rotwood scoundrels fell to his blade until none were left.\nI thanked him and asked his name, but he didn't respond. Confused, I tried introducing myself, telling him about our company and the work we'd been taking on to clear out bandits and beasts all over northern &lt;a href=\"Bangkorai\"&gt;Bangkorai&lt;/a&gt;. Nothing. Frustrated and a little disturbed, we left the cave and headed back to camp. He followed. I told him he wasn't welcome if he was going to keep up the silent treatment and hide his face from us, but it didn't help. Everyone was on edge, uneasy. We didn't see any signs of aggression, and I don't think anyone wanted to raise a sword to challenge him after the carnage with the Rotwoods earlier.\nIt just went on like that. He never talked at all. He took his food alone, off away from the camp, and never seemed to sleep, he just propped himself up against a tree or a rock at night, never once taking off a piece of that armor. None of us had seen the like of it before, all smooth, rounded pieces with strange feathery engravings. It was beautiful &lt;a href=\"silver\"&gt;silver&lt;/a&gt; with dark swirls, covering him entirely.

He was tireless, fearless, and, it seemed, dedicated to our goals.\nI wonder to this day if he had a name, if he was even a \"he\". I don't guess we'll ever know. Six months he tromped along with us on our contracts, and for those six months we prospered more than ever, we even added new blood to our roster. When winter came on, we headed back to Evermore for our usual time off (it's slow getting good work in the cold months), and one morning, he was gone. No sign, no tracks, nothing. Just disappeared. No one I've spoken to has ever heard of him or anything like him, and I get a lot of funny looks when I tell the tale. No matter. Wherever he is, I hope he's doing well and carrying on the good work."}

It was not without some regret that I bade farewell to the fleshpots of the &lt;a href=\"Imperial%20City%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Imperial City&lt;/a&gt;, but I knew that the wonders I had brought back from Raled-Makai had only scratched the surface of the Dwemer ruins in Morrowind. Even more spectacular treasures were out there, I felt, just waiting to be found, and I was eager to be off. I also had before me the salutary example of poor Bannerman, who was still dining out on his single expedition to &lt;a href=\"Black%20Marsh%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Black Marsh&lt;/a&gt; twenty years ago. That would never be me, I vowed.\nWith my letter from the Empress in hand, this time I would have the full cooperation of the Imperial authorities. No more need to worry about attacks from superstitious locals. But where should I look next? The ruins at &lt;a href=\"Kemel-Ze%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Kemel-Ze&lt;/a&gt; were the obvious choice. Unlike Raled-Makai, getting to the ruins would not be a problem. Also known as the \"Cliff City,\" Kemel-Ze lies on the mainland side of the &lt;a href=\"Vvardenfell%20Rift\"&gt;Vvardenfell Rift&lt;/a&gt;, sprawling down the sheer coastal cliff. Travelers from the east coast of &lt;a href=\"Vvardenfell%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Vvardenfell&lt;/a&gt; often visit the site by boat, and it can also be reached overland from the nearby villages without undue hardship.\nOnce my expedition had assembled in Seyda Neen, with the usual tedious complications involved in operating in this half-civilized land, we set out for the village of Marog near the ruins, where we hoped to hire a party of diggers. My interpreter, Tuen Panai, an unusually jolly fellow for a Dark Elf whom I had hired in &lt;a href=\"Seyda%20Neen%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Seyda Neen&lt;/a&gt; at the recommendation of the local garrison commander, assured me that the local villagers would be very familiar with Kemel-Ze, having looted the site for generations. Incidentally, Ten Penny (as we soon came to call him, to his constant amusement) proved invaluable and I would recommend him without hesitation to any of my colleagues who were planning similar expeditions to the wilds of Morrowind.\nAt Marog, we ran into our first trouble. The hetman of the village, a reserved, elegant old fellow, seemed willing to cooperate, but the local priest (a representative of the absurd religion they have here, worshiping something called the &lt;a href=\"Tribunal%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Tribunal&lt;/a&gt; who they claim actually live in palaces in Morrowind) was fervently against us excavating the ruins. He looked likely to sway the villagers to his side with his talk of \"religious taboos,\" but I waved the Empress's letter under his nose and mentioned something about my friend the garrison commander at Seyda Neen and he quieted right down. No doubt this was just a standard negotiating tactic arranged among the villagers to increase their pay. In any event, once the priest had stalked off muttering to himself, no doubt calling down curses upon the heads of the foreign devils, we soon had a line of villagers eager to sign on to the expedition.\nWhile my assistant was working out the mundane details of contracts, supplies, etc., Master Arum and I rode on to the ruins. By land, they can only be reached using narrow paths that wind down the face of the cliff from above, where any misstep threatens to send one tumbling into the sea foaming about the jagged rocks below. The city's original entrance to the surface must have been in the part of the city to the northeast\u2014the part that fell into the sea long ago when an eruption of Red Mountain created this mind-bogglingly vast crater. After successfully navigating the treacherous path, we found ourselves in a large chamber, open to the sky on one side, disappearing into the darkness on the other. As we stepped forward, our boots crunched on piles of broken metal, as common in Dwarven ruins as potsherds in other ancient sites. This was obviously where the looters brought their finds from deeper levels, stripping off the valuable outer casings of the Dwarven mechanisms and leaving their innards here\u2014easier than lugging the intact mechanisms back up to the top of the cliff. I laughed to myself, thinking of the many warriors unwittingly walking around &lt;a href=\"Tamriel\"&gt;Tamriel&lt;/a&gt; with pieces of Dwarven mechanisms on their backs. For that, of course, is what most \"Dwarven armor\" really is\u2014just the armored shells of ancient mechanical men. I sobered when I thought of how exceedingly valuable an intact mechanism would be. This place was obviously full of Dwarven devices, judging from the litter covering the floor of this vast chamber\u2014or had been, I reminded myself. Looters had been working over this site for centuries. Just the casing alone would be worth a small fortune, sold as armor. Most Dwarven armor is made of mismatched pieces from various devices, hence its reputation for being bulky and unwieldy. But a matched set from an intact mechanism is worth more than its weight in gold, for the pieces all fit together smoothly and the wearer hardly notices the bulk. Of course, I had no intention of destroying my finds for armor, no matter how valuable. I would bring it back to the Society for scientific study. I imagined the astonished cries of my colleagues as I unveiled it at my next lecture, and smiled again."}

It still gleamed brightly, as if new-made, the Dwarven alloys resisting the corrosion of time. I wondered what secrets remained hidden in the maze of chambers that lay before me, defying the efforts of looters, waiting to gleam again in the light they had not seen in long eons. Waiting for me. It remained only to find them! With an impatient gesture to Master Arum to follow, I strode forward into the gloom.\nMaster Arum, Ten Penny and I spent several days exploring the ruins while my assistants set up camp at the top of the cliff and hauled supplies and equipment from the village. I was looking for a promising area to begin excavation - a blocked passage or corridor untouched by looters that might lead to completely untouched areas of the ruins.\nWe found two such areas early on, but soon discovered that the many winding passages bypassed the blockage and gave access to the rooms behind. Nevertheless, even these outer areas, for the most part stripped clean of artifacts by generations of looters, were full of interest to the professional archaeologist. Behind a massive bronze door, burst from its hinges by some ancient turmoil of the earth, we discovered a large chamber filled with exquisite wall-carvings, which impressed even the jaded Ten Penny, who claimed to have explored every Dwarven ruin in Morrowind. They seemed to depict an ancient ritual of some kind, with a long line of classically-bearded Dwarven elders processing down the side walls, all seemingly bowing to the &lt;a href=\"Numidium\"&gt;giant form of a god&lt;/a&gt; carved into the front wall of the chamber, which was caught in the act of stepping forth from the crater of a mountain in a cloud of smoke or steam. According to Master Arum, there are no known depictions of Dwarven religious rituals, so this was an exciting find indeed. I set a team to work prying the carved panels from the wall, but they were unable to even crack the surface. On closer examination the chamber appeared to be faced with a metallic substance with the texture and feel of stone, impervious to any of our tools. I considered having Master Arum try his blasting magic on the walls, but decided that the risk of destroying the carvings was too great. Much as I would have preferred to bring them back to the Imperial City, I had to settle for taking rubbings of the carvings. If my colleagues in the Society showed enough interest, I was sure a specialist could be found, perhaps a master alchemist, who could find a way to safely remove the panels.\nI found another curious room at the top of a long winding stair, barely passable due to the fall of rubble from the roof. At the top of the stair was a domed chamber with a large ruined mechanism at its center. Painted constellations were still visible in some places on the surface of the dome. Master Arum and I agreed that this must have been some kind of observatory, and the mechanism was therefore the remains of a Dwarven telescope. To remove it from ruins down the narrow stairway would require its complete disassembly (which fact no doubt had preserved it from the attention of looters), so I decided to leave it in place for the time being. The existence of this observatory suggested, however, that this room had once been above the surface. Closer examination of the structure revealed that this was indeed a building, not an excavated chamber. The only other doorways from the room were completely blocked, and careful measurements from the top of the cliff to the entry room and then to the observatory revealed that we were still more than 250 feet below the present ground level. A sobering reminder of the forgotten fury of &lt;a href=\"Red%20Mountain%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Red Mountain&lt;/a&gt;.\nThis discovery led us to focus our attentions downward. Since we now knew approximately where the ancient surface lay, we could rule out many of the higher blocked passages. One wide passage, impressively flanked with carven pillars, particularly drew my interest. It ended in a massive rockfall, but we could see where looters had begun and then abandoned a tunnel through this debris. With my team of diggers and Master Arum's magery to assist, I believed we could succeed where our predecessors had failed. I therefore set my team of Dark Elves to work on clearing the passage, relieved finally to be beginning the real exploration of &lt;a href=\"Kemel-Ze%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Kemel-Ze&lt;/a&gt;. Soon, I hoped, my boots would be stirring up dust that had lain undisturbed since the dawn of time.\nWith this exciting prospect before me, I may have driven my diggers a bit too hard. Ten Penny reported that they were beginning to grumble about the long days, and that some were talking of quitting. Knowing from experience that nothing puts heart back into these Dark Elves like a taste of the lash, I had the ringleaders whipped and the rest confined to the ruins until they had finished clearing the passageway. Thank &lt;a href=\"Stendarr\"&gt;Stendarr&lt;/a&gt; for my foresight in requisitioning a few legionnaires from &lt;a href=\"Seyda%20Neen%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Seyda Neen&lt;/a&gt;! They were sullen at first, but with the promise of an extra day's wages when they broke through, they soon set to work with a will. While these measures may sound harsh to my readers back in the comforts of civilization, let me assure you that there is no other way to get these people to stick to a task."}

The diggers were as excited as I was when their picks finally broke through the far end into emptiness, and we shared a round of the local liquor together (a foul concoction, in truth) to show that all was forgiven. I could hardly restrain my eagerness as they enlarged the hole to allow entry into the chamber beyond. Would the passage lead to entire new levels of the ancient city, filled with artifacts left by the vanished Dwarves? Or would it be only a dead end, some side passage leading nowhere? My excitement grew as I slid through the hole and crouched for a moment in the darkness beyond. From the echoing sounds of the stones rattling beneath my feet, I was in a large room. Perhaps very large. I stood up carefully, and unhooded my lantern. As the light flooded the chamber, I looked around in astonishment. Here were wonders beyond even my wildest dreams!\nAs the light from my lamp filled the chamber beyond the rock fall, I looked around in astonishment. Everywhere was the warm glitter of Dwarven alloys. I had found an untouched section of the ancient city! My heart pounding with excitement, I looked around me. The room was vast, the roof soaring up into darkness beyond the reach of my lamp, the far end lost in shadows with only a tantalizing glimmer hinting at treasures not yet revealed. Along each wall stood rows of mechanical men, intact except for one oddity: their heads had been ritually removed and placed on the floor at their feet. This could mean only one thing - I had discovered the tomb of a great Dwarven noble, maybe even a king! Burials of this type had been discovered before, most famously by Ransom's expedition to &lt;a href=\"Hammerfell%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Hammerfell&lt;/a&gt;, but no completely intact tomb had ever been found. Until now.\nBut if this was truly a royal burial, where was the tomb? I stepped forward gingerly, the rows of headless bodies standing silently as they had for eons, their disembodied eyes seeming to watch me as I passed. I had heard wild tales of the Curse of the Dwarves, but had always laughed it off as superstition. But now, breathing the same air as the mysterious builders of this city, which had lain undisturbed since the cataclysm that spelled their doom, I felt a twinge of fear. There was some power here, I felt, something malevolent that resented my presence. I stopped for a moment and listened. All was silent.\nExcept \u2026 it seemed I heard a faint hiss, regular as breathing. I fought down a sudden surge of panic. I was unarmed, not thinking of danger in my haste to explore past the blocked passage. Sweat dripped down my face as I scanned the gloom for any movement. The room was warm, I suddenly noticed, much warmer than the rest of the labyrinth thus far. My excitement returned. Could I have found a section of the city still connected to a functioning steam grid? Pipes ran along the walls, as in all sections of the city. I walked over and placed my hand on one. It was hot, almost too hot to touch! Now I saw that in places where the ancient piping had corroded, small jets of steam were escaping - the sound I had heard. I laughed at my own credulity.\nI now advanced quickly to the far end of the room, giving a cheerful salute to the ranks of mechanical soldiers who had appeared so menacing only moments before. I smiled with triumph as the light swept back the darkness of centuries to reveal the giant effigy of a Dwarven king standing on a raised dais, his metal hand clutching his rod of office. This was the prize indeed! I circled the dais slowly, admiring the craftsmanship of the ancient Dwarves. The golden king stood twenty feet tall under a freestanding domed cupola, his long upswept beard jutting forward proudly as his glittering metal eyes seemed to follow me. But my superstitious mood had passed, and I gazed benevolently on the old Dwarven king. My king, as I had already begun to think of him. I stepped onto the dais to get a better look at the sculpted armor. Suddenly the eyes of the figure opened and it raised a mailed fist to strike!\nI leaped to one side as the golden arm came crashing down, striking sparks from the steps where I had stood a moment before. With a hiss of steam and the whir of gears, the giant figure stepped ponderously out from under its canopy and strode towards me with frightening speed, its eyes tracking me as I scrambled backwards. I dodged behind a pillar as the fist whistled down again. I had dropped my lantern in the confusion, and now I crept into the darkness outside the pool of light, hoping to slip between the headless mechanisms and thus escape back to the safety of the passageway. Where had the monster gone? You would think that a twenty-foot golden king would be hard to miss, but he was nowhere to be seen. The guttering lamp only illuminated a small part of the room. He could be hiding anywhere in the gloom. I crawled faster. Without warning, the dim ranks of Dwarven soldiers in front of me went flying as the monstrous guardian loomed before me. He had cut off my escape! As I dodged backwards, blow after blow whistled down as the implacable machine followed me relentlessly, driving me into the far corner of the room. At last there was nowhere left for me to go. My back was to the wall. I glared up at my foe, determined to die on my feet. The huge fists lifted for one final blow."}

Bolts of purple energy crackled across the metal carapace of the Dwarven monster, and it halted, half-turning to meet this new threat. Master Arum had come! I was about to raise a cheer when the giant figure turned back to me, unharmed by the lightning bolt hurled by Master Arum, determined to destroy this first intruder. I shouted out \"Steam! Steam!\" as the giant raised his fist to crush me into the floor. There was a hiss and a gust of bitter cold and I looked up. The monster was now covered with a shell of ice, frozen in the very moment of dispatching me. Master Arum had understood. I leaned against the wall with relief.\nThe ice cracked above me. The giant golden king stood before me, the shell of ice falling away, his head swiveling towards me in triumph. Was there no stopping this Dwarven monstrosity? But then the light faded from his eyes, and his arms dropped to his sides. The magical frost had worked, cooling its steam-driven energy.\nAs Master Arum and the diggers crowded around me, congratulating me on my narrow escape, my thoughts drifted. I imagined my return to the &lt;a href=\"Imperial%20City%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Imperial City&lt;/a&gt;, and I knew that this would be my greatest triumph yet. How could I possibly top this find? Perhaps it was time to move on. Recovering the fabled &lt;a href=\"Eye%20of%20Argonia%20%28Artifact%29\"&gt;Eye of Argonia&lt;/a&gt;\u2026now that would be a coup! I smiled to myself, reveling in the glory of the moment but already planning my next adventure."}

They will find \"&lt;a href=\"Sir%20Hughes%27%20Journal\"&gt;Sir Hughes' Journal&lt;/a&gt;\" on the table and it gives an insight in what has happened to the knight and why he's turned against the duchess. But when arriving at the &lt;a href=\"Alcaire%20Keep\"&gt;Alcaire Keep&lt;/a&gt; to find the duchess, they are too late. The duke is leaning over her body and when they talk to him, he will ask why someone would do this \u2014 \"\"where are the &lt;a href=\"Knights%20of%20the%20Flame%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Knights of the Flame&lt;/a&gt; and why didn't they protect his wife?\"\"\nWhen the Vestige search her body they will find a blade that belongs to Sir Hughes, and when they tell the duke it was the knight that was responsible for killing the duchess, he will not believe it. Why would he do this and what will he say to her sister and father."}

The Pale Spirit was so laden with Nordic booty she plowed through the sea like a harbor seal, but we made port without so much as a sailor overboard. Unknown to us, our next expedition would be our most dangerous yet.\nWe reached the port in &lt;a href=\"Wayrest%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Wayrest&lt;/a&gt;, and it took only a few days before &lt;a href=\"Captain%20Wereshark\"&gt;Captain Wereshark&lt;/a&gt; made the acquaintance of Duke Gignac, the aging &lt;a href=\"Bretons%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Breton&lt;/a&gt; adventurer. He purchased many of our Nordic relics and, impressed by my captain's legendary charisma (and, more importantly, the urging of his oldest daughter, Lucette) my captain suckered the old man into funding the Pale Spirit's next expedition to the Maormer islands of Pyandonea. Wearing a new red feather from Lucette in his crown, the Wereshark returned us to sea.\nOur stated purpose was to do what we could to open permanent trade relations with the &lt;a href=\"Maormer\"&gt;Sea Elves&lt;/a&gt;, but the Wereshark, as always, intended merely to plunder all we could. Aside the war galleons Cliff Racer and Silver Arrow (hired from Beldros Hlaalu for a decent fee and percentage of the booty) we sailed with a wind at our backs and enough supplies to feed an army of ravenous &lt;a href=\"Nords%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Nords&lt;/a&gt; for months. As with all our expeditions, things went just fine until they didn't. Those Maormer sea serpents? They aren't just legends.\nOur first encounter came shortly after we first sighted a jungle isle common to Sea Elves, in the distance cloaked by a dense fog. The sound of snapping wood and screaming men drifted across the sea as the Wereshark, myself, and every armed sailor rushed to the Pale Spirit's deck. We were just in time to see the Cliff Racer's broken hull sinking below the waves, wrapped in the scaled coils of an enormous snake.\nNever one for half measures, the Wereshark shouted for every archer on the boat to loose arrows. Arrows peppered the slimy beast as it dragged the Cliff Racer to her grave, yet no shaft could penetrate the beast's thick scales. That's when that old lizard Hard-Scales grabbed his poison daggers and leapt into the sea, shouting something about &lt;a href=\"Sithis\"&gt;Sithis&lt;/a&gt;. That crazy &lt;a href=\"Argonians%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Argonian&lt;/a&gt; has had a death wish since the day he signed on.\nWouldn't you know it, as Mighty Flicka boomed warnings to the Silver Arrow from atop the mainmast and the Wereshark rallied every sailor capable of swinging a sword, something surfaced on the frothing sea. Old Hard-Scales, covered in glistening black serpent blood, and behind him, the bobbing length of a massive Maormer serpent. Stiff and dead as something dragged in by a barn cat.\nNow, don't ask me how Hard-Scales managed to get his daggers through its scales, or how he managed to breath under the sea for all that time, or how he knew his poison was vile enough to drop a snake twice as long as a galleon. All I know is Hard-Scales never talked about it, after, save for expressions of disappointment over failing to meet Sithis once more. As we took on survivors from the Cliff Racer, the Wereshark pledged a full chest of booty to Hard-Scales. No one complained.\nWary of more serpents, the Wereshark gave orders to anchor off the shore of the fog-cloaked jungle isle, in shallow water where we could see anything between us and the sea floor. Pale Spirit and Silver Arrow sent four boats ashore with the Wereshark at their head. Yet not one water-colored Sea Elf showed his face when we made landing.\nWe all thought the island abandoned. We could not have been more wrong."}

Irregular growling and snorting peppered with ear-splitting snaps of breaking wood, like a wild boar rutting on a bed of rotted timbers. It came from somewhere in the thick cluster of skinny trees that crept up on the white sand beach.\nAny other captain would have had us back on the boats and out to the &lt;a href=\"Pale%20Spirit\"&gt;Pale Spirit&lt;/a&gt; before you could gather enough spit to fill a thimble, but the &lt;a href=\"Captain%20Wereshark\"&gt;Wereshark's&lt;/a&gt; a different sort. He called us all to order on the white-sand beach, his booming growl forming sailors up as pretty as a military procession. The first sailor to gut whatever beast made that teeth-grinding racket, the Wereshark proclaimed, would get his pick of plunder items from the expedition, as well as a &lt;a href=\"welwa\"&gt;welwa&lt;/a&gt; steak dinner in the Wereshark's personal cabin.\nJust like that, the crew went from worried to eager, for battle and everything else. IF you've never had welwa steak, dear reader, know there's nothing better. The way Bagroga salts and cooks it, it tastes like beef and salted cheese and slides down your gullet like greased plantains. No man who sails with the Wereshark can smell it without their mouth watering, and I'll admit, even my own stomach grumbled its assent.\nThe Wereshark broke us into groups. &lt;a href=\"Hard-Scales\"&gt;Hard-Scales&lt;/a&gt; would lead a party consisting of Bugnose, One-Eyed Bahzi, and five sailors from the Cliff Racer along the beach, in case the forest beasts ventured out to the sea or there was habitation to be found and looted. Mighty Flicka would lead the tribe of &lt;a href=\"Nords%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Nord&lt;/a&gt; axe swingers, who signed on with us at the Starving Dog, east into the forest to kill or flush whatever was making that rhythmic growl, with Galena Two-Scars along the scout. Never did I see a &lt;a href=\"Bosmer%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Wood Elf&lt;/a&gt; happier to see trees.\nThe Wereshark chose to lead the last group himself. That including his loyal first mate (yours truly), the Snowclaw twins, &lt;a href=\"Vimy%20Lacroix\"&gt;Vimy Lacroix&lt;/a&gt;, and the exiled &lt;a href=\"Altmer%20%28Online%29\"&gt;High Elf&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Neramo\"&gt;Neramo&lt;/a&gt;. We were to scout the rocky shoals to the south of our landing position and circle around to Hard-Scales's group. We were a smaller party than the rest, but I've never met a knife-ear better at making people explode than Neramo the Mad Mage.\nThe shoals were treacherous but empty, and we trekked for almost an hour, listening to that horrible growling, before we came across a bunch of empty huts made out of sticks, mud, and leaves. No one was home and there was nothing in the homes but giant egg shell fragments, but it confirmed the island was inhabited, or had been, until whatever was it that forest got hungry and came out on the beach.\nThe growling came and went, teeth-grinding as ever, but we'd heard no screaming or shouts of terror from the other parties. That meant whatever it was, Mightly Flicka hadn't found it yet. I almost pitied whatever was making the racket until it stepped out into the beach and stared at us, a four legged lizard bull twice as tall as Bugnose. The thing had green scales and, I swear by &lt;a href=\"Mara\"&gt;Mara's&lt;/a&gt; skirts, a glittering trident shiny as one you'd see carried by some stuffy &lt;a href=\"Altmer%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Altmer&lt;/a&gt; Queensguard on the streets of &lt;a href=\"Auridon\"&gt;Auridon&lt;/a&gt;.\nNeedless to say, no one objected when Neramo hit it in the face with a fireball."}

The &lt;a href=\"Captain%20Wereshark\"&gt;Wereshark&lt;/a&gt; ordered us back onto the shoals, where the lizard beast's footing became treacherous. The Snowclaw twins filled the beast with arrows but could not bring it down, and I wished desperately for some of Hard-Scales's deadly poison. That's when Vimy sprang into action, sprinting so fast I could hardly follow.\nThe beast swung at her with its trident, but Vimy slid under the strike and vaulted herself onto its back with no more effort than mounting a horse. Moments later the lizard bull had knives sticking out of both eyes. Blinded, all it could do was roar and swing its trident as Neramo set it once more aflame.\nWith a fierce cry, the Wereshark called us to action. He and the Snowclaw twins fell upon the beast with axe and blade as I called down spells to aid and heal them from afar. Blinded, burning, and exhausted, the beast fell, but not before a blind swing tossed Baldor Snowclaw across the beach. Fortunately, the blow only hit his head, the hardest part of a &lt;a href=\"Nords%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Nord&lt;/a&gt;, and I ensured he didn't bleed for all that long.\nBeast dealt with, the Wereshark ordered us to search the huts one last time. We found absolutely nothing of value, just those egg shell fragments, and so the Wereshark wisely ordered us back to the boats. The growling hadn't stopped, which meant more massive lizard bulls lumbered through the trees.\nAn island filled with empty huts and lizard bulls was not the place to risk our lives. There were other pearls to be clutched. We returned to the beach to await the others, and when we reached it, we found an army of glistening &lt;a href=\"Maormer\"&gt;Sea Elves&lt;/a&gt;. They surrounded our boats and had Hard-Scales, Bugnose, and the Cliff Racer survivors hostage. I learned later the &lt;a href=\"Khajiit%20%28Online%29\"&gt;cat&lt;/a&gt;-hating bastards gutted One-Eyed Bahzi for sport.\nCloaked from view, the Wereshark took our counsel. We couldn't leave Hard-Scales and Bugnose in chains, and besides, the Sea Elves had our ships. A Maormer warship was just visible anchored between the Pale Spirit, the Silver Arrow, and open sea, which would hinder our escape even if we did manage to somehow return to them. After a moment of consideration, the Wereshark made his decision. We would \"negotiate.\"\nHe ordered us to wait in the shadows and to attack only if he shouted \"&lt;a href=\"Stendarr\"&gt;Stendarr&lt;/a&gt;'s Blood!\" Understand, dear reader, we are pirates, and all pirates know the fate of one taken by Sea Elves. Any of us would gladly embrace a death gutting those knife-ears over being carved up as a storm sacrifice. If the Sea Elves refused to negotiate, the Wereshark promised, more than a few of them would be floating home.\nThe moment the Wereshark announced himself, over four dozen Sea Elves drew blades and bows and turned to him, milky eyes wide, but my captain sauntered toward them as if strolling down any crowded street in &lt;a href=\"Abah%27s%20Landing\"&gt;Abah's Landing&lt;/a&gt;. He kept his hands visible and away from his sword hilts, and the Sea Elves let him come. No doubt Hard-Scales had told them of our captain's many exploits, as instructed.\nWhen they moved to disarm him, the Wereshark made no protest as they removed his swords, and then the daggers from his boots, and the dagger from his belt, and those up his sleeves. That was when the slimmest of the Sea Elves, a pale-faced fool in golden armor that glinted in the sun, approached my captain and backhanded him across the face. The Wereshark spit at his feet and grinned wide.\nI glanced at Vimy, who rolled her eyes. Not a good start to the negotiations. Mighty Flicka chose that moment to charge from the forest with her Nords, all howling like a pack of enraged &lt;a href=\"welwa\"&gt;welwa&lt;/a&gt;s.\nEight trident-swinging lizard bulls rushed the beach after them, chased by a gleeful Galena Two-Scars."}

They foolishly turned their arrows on the enraged beasts. The futile attacks only enraged the lizard bulls all the more, and in the commotion, the Wereshark shouted \"&lt;a href=\"Stendarr\"&gt;Stendarr&lt;/a&gt;'s Blood!\" As one, we charged into battle.\nThe enraged lizard bulls fell upon the frightened Sea Elves, ripping them apart or tossing them into the trees. By the time the Sea Elves rallied, forming a phalanx of shields and casting lightning and storms, Mighty Flicka and the rest were past them, meeting us at the shore. The Wereshark had reclaimed his weapons by then, and those Sea Elves too slow to flee fell as we freed our compatriots from bondage.\nCaught between a crowd of the most ruthless buccaneers to ever raise a sail and a herd of enraged lizard bulls, even the cluster of Sea Elves wilted like a moon blossom in &lt;a href=\"Sentinel%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Sentinel's&lt;/a&gt; heat. Eventually, the surviving Maormer scattered and fled into the woods, chased by most of the lizard bulls. With Neramo and Vimy to show the others how it was done, we took down what few lizard bulls challenged us.\nAfter quickly looting every valuable we could from the Elf corpses, we survivors rushed into our boats and pushed out onto open sea. All of us kept wary eyes on the anchored Sea Elf galleon floating beyond the Pale Spirit. New fog rolled in behind us, and I'll never forget the tortured cries of those Sea Elves as the lizard bulls chased them down and gored them. Despite their barbarous ways, I almost pitied the poor bastards as the island's terrifying inhabitants slaughtered them to the last.\n&lt;a href=\"Captain%20Wereshark\"&gt;Captain Wereshark&lt;/a&gt; now wore the golden-armored leader's helmet on his own head, though that was more of a mocking joke than a permanent adjustment. As if the Wereshark would ever truly doff his ever-changing tangle of marvelous colored feathers! How then would people recognize him?\nAs we rowed, and Sea Elves screamed, we waited for lightning, or storms, or another sea serpent attack, but we reached the Pale Spirit and clambered aboard as the surviving crew of the Silver Arrow did the same. We set sail, but the Sea Elf warship stayed where it was anchored. I knew then that fool of a Sea Elf captain had not left enough sailors on board to sail his warship home. On another day we might have seized her, but we had neither the necessary crew to sail her nor a benefactor who would buy her.\nI watched the fog swallow that Sea Elf warship and the island of enraged lizard bulls. The screams persisted long after both had vanished from view, but soon there was no sound but the gentle lapping of the sea and the flapping of the Pale Spirit's mighty sails. We sailed with the Silver Arrow all through the night, in case there were more Sea Elf warships in search of the first, but no others challenged us. The fog burned off with the new day to reveal another island, far more promising than the last.\nAs we slid silently forward and sailors readied weapons, we could see the glistening spires of Sea Elf architecture and, more importantly, no visible Sea Elf soldiers guarding her shores. This was likely another fishing village, so remote none expected attack. Our haul from this raid would be massive.\nWith a twinkle in his eye and his feathers flapping in the wind, Captain Wereshark ordered the attack."}

Flicker, bright, dim ... The fire in the hearth provides light and heat. Neither seem to affect the old man. His reclining figure stares into the flames and flames reflect back from his deep dark eyes. Indigo blue robes reflect and yet absorb the firelight and highlights of golden threads twinkle as the flames flicker. His beard and hair are long and snowy white; in the firelight they almost appear to be ethereal like that of a godling. At his side is a tall pointed hat which is the same color as his robe and also twinkles with highlights of gold. The face is lined with age, yet almost appears youthful; wisdom and intellect exude from his personage. This is the Sage who is known in all of &lt;a href=\"Tamriel\"&gt;Tamriel&lt;/a&gt; as the champion and counselor to all users of magic. His thoughts wander, and he remembers ...\n&lt;a href=\"Gyron%20Vardengroet\"&gt;Gyron Vardengroet&lt;/a&gt; was born to a poor and humble &lt;a href=\"Bretons%20%28Daggerfall%29\"&gt;Breton&lt;/a&gt; family in the village of &lt;a href=\"Moonguard\"&gt;Moonguard&lt;/a&gt;. The only child of &lt;a href=\"Frieda%20Vardengroet\"&gt;Frieda&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Horstle%20Vardengroet\"&gt;Horstle Vardengroet&lt;/a&gt; entered life during a rare eclipse of Tamriel's moons. It was soon apparent that he was unusually gifted in the magical arts. He was found levitating the family dog when he was only a year old. Most Bretons have a great talent for magic, but as he grew Gyron displayed a talent far greater than that of his peers. The village wizard began to take an interest in young Gyron and soon took him under his wing. In spite of the young man's proclivities for being rowdy, the old Wizard &lt;a href=\"Grungdingler\"&gt;Grungdingler&lt;/a&gt; liked him and worked hard to teach him the magical arts to the extent of his own skills.\nFinally the day came when Grungdingler could teach Gyron no more. The young mage had surpassed his master, and he was somewhat unsettled with the apprentice mage's questions about life, death and immortality. Grundingler called Gyron to him and gave him a letter addressed to &lt;a href=\"Morkledder\"&gt;Morkledder&lt;/a&gt;, the Guildmagister of the &lt;a href=\"Mages%20Guild%20%28Daggerfall%29\"&gt;Mages Guild&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Shornhelm\"&gt;Shornhelm&lt;/a&gt;. The young mage told his parents of his fortune, packed his meager belongings, and set out for the journey to Shornhelm. After many months of travel through the foothills of the &lt;a href=\"Kurallian%20Mountains\"&gt;Kurallian Mountains&lt;/a&gt;, Gyron arrived at the gates to the great City-State of Shornhelm high in the mountainous terrain of &lt;a href=\"High%20Rock\"&gt;High Rock&lt;/a&gt;.\nAfter the life of a quiet Breton village, Shornhelm was a wonder to Gyron. He explored the city from one end to the other, and eventually found the Mages Guild. Presenting Grungdingler's letter to Morkledder, Gyron was received warmly. Morkledder explained to Gyron that he would need to be tested before any commitment to further training could be made. After a night of rest and meditation, Gyron was shown into the main hall of the Mages Guild which was now filled with magic users of all kinds. It was very quiet. The young mage felt as if his heart was in his throat as he approached the Council of Three, the leaders of the mages in this City-State. Morkledder rose and explained to Gyron the various tests he would be subjected to to prove his worth as a mage. The youth then turned and left the Council Chamber, the eyes of the many mages on him, and went forth to complete the tasks that had been defined for him.\nReturning to Shornhelm several years later, Gyron was admitted to the Mages Guild and shown to the Council Chamber where he was met by Morkledder. The ancient mage reviewed the journal entries, the artifacts gathered, and most especially the spellbook entries presented to him by Gyron. An expression of amazement spread across the old wizard's face; there had never been a novice to accomplish what Gyron had during the testing. Morkledder then called a full session of the Guild presenting Gyron as a full Wizard.\nGyron remained with Morkledder for several years and studied hard. In private session several years after the testing, Morkledder admitted to Gyron that the Guild at Shornhelm could teach him no more and that he should seek further enlightenment at the &lt;a href=\"Crystal%20Tower\"&gt;Crystal Tower&lt;/a&gt; on &lt;a href=\"Sumurset%20Isle\"&gt;Sumurset Isle&lt;/a&gt;.\nAfter packing his possessions once again, Gyron set off on another long journey. He arrived at the Crystal Tower several years later after having traversed the province of &lt;a href=\"Hammerfell\"&gt;Hammerfell&lt;/a&gt; where he had many adventures, met many other mages and shared his experiences and knowledge with them. He heard stories of wonderful plants that when combined with other elements could restore life to those dead, prolong life to those yet living, and in the proper combination bestow immortality on the user. Gyron was always quick to advise and guide mages who were less experienced than himself. He loved being able to help. He made many friends and stories began to spread across the land about this exceptional user of magic.\nWhen he entered the Crystal Tower, he was greeted by several mages all clamoring for his attention. His reputation had preceded him. However, the crowd hushed and parted at the arrival of a very imposing figure dressed all in indigo blue robes trimmed in gold, wearing a high pointed hat and carrying the most beautifully carved staff Gyron had ever seen. The Elder of the Council of Wizards, &lt;a href=\"Esthlainder\"&gt;Esthlainder&lt;/a&gt;, looked closely at the young wizard, nodded and turned to walk back into the tower. Without delay, Gyron followed him. The audience that followed stunned the young mage.\nEsthlainder explained to him that Gyron's coming had been foretold for many years, and he had been expected. The mages had been told by the Gods that one of their own would come along to provide guidance, knowledge and aid. Gyron was that promised champion and leader. Gyron was confused and uncertain. How could he be such an extraordinary person? What must he do to fulfill his destiny? Many questions spilled from him to which Esthlainder could not provide the answers. The Elder suggested that Gyron stay with them in the Crystal Tower for a while and study. This he did.\nThe day finally came when The Elder admitted to Gyron that the Crystal Tower could no longer provide anything new and that he needed to travel the lands of Tamriel and seek the wisdom and knowledge. The Elder sighed and told Gyron how sad he was that the Crystal Tower was losing him, but that his destiny must be fulfilled. With this, the Elder presented Gyron with a package wrapped in the same beautiful indigo blue as the Elder's Robes. Gyron was told to take the package with him but open it only when he was at least a day's travel from the &lt;a href=\"Crystal%20Tower\"&gt;Crystal Tower&lt;/a&gt;.\nAfter a long day's walk, Gyron set up camp in a beautiful glade next to a brook of crystal clear water. Finally, he thought, I can open the Elder's package. As he untied the golden cord that had bound the package, he found that the wrapping was not wrapping at all but an exquisitely tailored robe identical to the one worn by the Elder. As he opened the robe, a high pointed wizard's hat popped out of the package, and with a \"whoosh\" and \"pop,\" the same intricately carved staff that the Elder had carried appeared. A note from the Elder advised that the garments were indestructible and that the staff had many magical properties for Gyron to discover. It went on further to explain that from this day forward Gyron would be known as The Sage.\nTired from his walking and with an inner glow of accomplishment, The Sage settled down for the first night of his long pilgrimage across the lands.\nAfter many months of further travels and adventures, The Sage returned to Moonguard and was warmly welcomed by the villagers and most especially by his parents, Frieda and Horstle. News of his coming had preceded him and the whole village had worked hard to build and furnish a cottage for the mage in the pleasant forest just outside the town. After a festive banquet that evening, Gyron retired to his new home.\nThe Sage settled into his life outside Moonguard. He received many visitors who have traveled from near and far to seek his guidance, help, and training. The years passed. It was not long before first Horstle and then Frieda died. The Sage was devastated by his loss. In his grief he swore to dedicate the rest of his life to defeating death so that grief like his could be avoided by others.\nHe returned to the Great Library at the Crystal Tower and researched the many flowers, herbs and plants that he had heard about and seen during his travels. In his cottage, he labored tirelessly over the spellbooks, vials and collection of flora from all over the lands. He tested the potions on himself. The years went by, but The Sage seemed not to age anymore. At some point he had found the right combination in his experiments, but could not determine which combination it had been as the change had been most subtle. He had secured a life without end. And the years continued to pass.\nMages came to him for help which he freely gave. The Sage settled into his life of advising and guiding and the years continued to pass. Unfortunately, his fame became so great that the call for his help was unmanageable. He reluctantly packed his possessions for the last time, and moved far into the Kurallian Mountains and built a magical fortress. Only the most worthy magic user could gain access and help from The Sage.\nHowever, following his heart, even today The Sage often leaves his mountain abode and travels the land helping young mages gain experience and to grow.\nSnap, crackle ... The firelight flickers... The old mage stirs as the memories fade and flicker like the firelight. Bang, bang, bang... echoes from the pounding knocker on the great oaken doors of the fortress... The Sage rises and heads for the doors knowing that yet another mage in need has found him and is worthy of help."}

This is most likely due to the superstitious locals' exaggerated reverence for burial grounds of the dead, even those of other cultures. I wouldn't go so far as to accuse the &lt;a href=\"Alik%27r\"&gt;Alik'r&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Redguards%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Redguards&lt;/a&gt; of timidity, but really, having to bring all my own people over the bay from &lt;a href=\"High%20Rock%20%28Online%29\"&gt;High Rock&lt;/a&gt; is a bit much.\nIn any event, now that we are on our way, we shall do the job right. The known facts about Salas En are few, but they are fascinating, as it has been inhabited over the last three eras by a series of cultures. On top\u2014which makes it most recent, of course\u2014are Redguard relics dating from the &lt;a href=\"First%20Era\"&gt;First-Era&lt;/a&gt; occupation of Salas En by &lt;a href=\"The%20Crowns\"&gt;Crowns&lt;/a&gt; of the late &lt;a href=\"Ra%20Gada\"&gt;Ra Gada&lt;/a&gt;. Colonists from the island of &lt;a href=\"Yath\"&gt;Yath&lt;/a&gt; in lost &lt;a href=\"Yokuda\"&gt;Yokuda&lt;/a&gt;, these Redguards seem to have displaced the Elves who previously occupied the site. It appears these descendants of Yath occupied Salas En until abandoning it in the middle &lt;a href=\"First%20Era%2323rd%20century\"&gt;23rd century&lt;/a&gt;, which coincides with the ravages of the &lt;a href=\"Thrassian%20Plague\"&gt;Thrassian Plague&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe Elves the Yath Redguards displaced were, according to tradition, relatively recent &lt;a href=\"Altmer%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Altmeri&lt;/a&gt; colonists of the &lt;a href=\"Corelanya%20Clan\"&gt;Corelanya Clan&lt;/a&gt;, who were said to be Daedra-worshipers. (This would account for their emigration from &lt;a href=\"Summerset%20Isles%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Summerset&lt;/a&gt; to the austere shores of Hammerfell.) They seem to have arrived sometime in the &lt;a href=\"1E%20600\"&gt;sixth century&lt;/a&gt;\u00a01E, inhabiting and expanding on structures originally built by the &lt;a href=\"Ayleid\"&gt;Ayleid&lt;/a&gt;s. &lt;a href=\"Bosmer%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Bosmeri&lt;/a&gt; relics are intermixed here with classic high-period Altmeri, suggesting that either the Corelanya participated in the Wood Elf coastal trade, then at its historic height, or that Salas En was used as a stopover by Bosmeri merchants before the Corelanya arrived.\nBelow these High Elf additions\u2014and indeed, still standing with less wear on them than any of the structures built afterward\u2014are the original Ayleid stoneworks, jutting proudly toward the heavens despite the passage of millennia. The Ayleid Elves who built Salas En are virtually unknown to history, and it is primarily to reveal their story that I have organized this expedition. With the assistance of my experienced and hand-picked team of excavators, I have every confidence that we can persuade the stones of Salas En to reveal their secrets to us."}

A successfully completed ritual will result on &lt;a href=\"Sanguine\"&gt;Sanguine&lt;/a&gt;, Prince of Debauchery, appearing before the Agent, who will make them an enticing offer:\n\"Power is such a lovely word, isn't it? It drips from the tongue like honey. If power is your aphrodisiac, I would be ecstatic to present you with The Sanguine Rose. All you have to do for me in return is punish a perfectly awful priest who dared to challenge me. Sounds good to you?\"\nThe Agent has to make a choice, either accept the Prince's task or reject their \"aphrodisiac.\"\nA Turbulent Priest.\nAccepting Sanguine's offer will result in the Agent being sent to destroy a \"sanctimonious monk,\" who has burned Sanguine's \"lovely worshippers to crisps.\" Sanguine therefore instructs the Agent to head into an \"abandoned temple\" and \"rip [their] heart from [their] chest.\" From there, the Agent must head to an apostle of Sanguine residing in another town, who will hand the Agent their reward.\nWith that, the Agent is off to the \"abandoned temple,\" which is one of the &lt;a href=\"Regions%20%28Daggerfall%29\"&gt;regions&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Dungeons%20%28Daggerfall%29\"&gt;dungeons&lt;/a&gt;. Inside, the Agent will come across the usual variety of &lt;a href=\"Creatures%20%28Daggerfall%29\"&gt;creatures&lt;/a&gt;, as well as the &lt;a href=\"Monk%20%28Daggerfall%29\"&gt;Monk&lt;/a&gt; in question. However, there may be a number of other randomly generated \"monks\" in the dungeon, meaning the Agent will have to keep killing until the following notification appears:\n\"[Monk's name] is dead. Sanguine will be ecstatic, you hope.\"\nFrom there, the Agent must escape the dungeon and meet with Sanguine's apostle before the time limit expires. The apostle will be found in the building in the town identified by the Daedric Prince, and will give the Agent their reward if they arrive in time.\nRewards.\nCompleting the quest successfully within the time limit will see the Agent rewarded with &lt;a href=\"Sanguine\"&gt;Sanguine&lt;/a&gt;'s favored tool, his &lt;a href=\"Sanguine%20Rose%20%28Daggerfall%29\"&gt;Rose&lt;/a&gt;. Furthermore, the Agent will receive a boost in reputation with whatever faction they used to summon Sanguine for ending the quest in triumph. Conversely, failing the quest will cost the Agent reputation with the summoner's faction.\nThe changes made to reputation, either by successfully completing or failing the quest are shown below:"}

Rare enough to be creatures of legend, Sea Giants have nonetheless appeared in &lt;a href=\"Nords%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Nord&lt;/a&gt; maritime tales dating back to the &lt;a href=\"First%20Era\"&gt;First Era&lt;/a&gt;. Despite this long history of encounters, little is known about Sea Giant culture and behavior.\nThe evidence that can be gathered from fisherman's tales suggests that unlike their landlocked, herding &lt;a href=\"Giant%20%28Online%29\"&gt;cousins&lt;/a&gt;, Sea Giants are capable of complex tool usage and group coordination as they hunt their natural prey\u2014the &lt;a href=\"whale\"&gt;whale&lt;/a&gt;s that lurk below the sea ice.\nWhile &lt;a href=\"Mammoth%20%28Online%29\"&gt;mammoth&lt;/a&gt; herders form an alliance with their herd and live in peaceful harmony, Sea Giants are cunning, efficient, and fearless predators. With great luck, I had an opportunity to observe the results of a Sea Giant hunt which washed ashore. The carcass was a wealth of information for the keen naturalist's eye.\nUpon approaching the dead whale, the most striking observation I had, aside from the smell, was the large wooden shaft emerging from just above the creature's dorsal fin. Wider than a Nord's thigh, the pole appeared to be broken off in its hide. The end was tipped with a point similar in structure to a harpoon, carved of solid bone and lodged in the blubber above the whale's ribs. A grave wound, but hardly fatal.\nSo how then did the creature die? Its thick hide told a grisly tale. Slashes and cuts scored its back and sides, with several huge chunks of flesh stripped away. Sliced clean with a blade. It appears the Sea Giants had begun carving it up alive.\nThis is not unprecedented. Having observed the hunting tactics of &lt;a href=\"Durzog%20%28Online%29\"&gt;durzog&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Wolf%20%28Online%29\"&gt;wolves&lt;/a&gt; taking on large game, tearing into the prey until blood loss and shock set in is an efficient strategy. The sturdy frame, enormous strength, and resistance to cold would make them adept at leaping into the frigid waters and wrestling with their quarry. The fights must be savage. I suspect it would take half a dozen or more Giants to incapacitate an adult whale.\nSailors have claimed sightings of Sea Giant vessels in the frozen wastes. Great ships the size of islands, armed with jagged spears. Of course, these accounts are widely considered exaggerated to the point of fancy. But a vessel that holds a hunting party would have to be enormous.\nThere is so much more we do not know about Sea Giants. Are they intelligent enough to coordinate smaller ships and plan precise attacks? Or do they rather lumber along on one vessel and opportunistically swarm their prey? How do they draw the whales from the depths? This one carcass, torn free from its tether by a sudden swell or storm, has dredged up more questions than answers."}

Helvi (whom can be found inside the &lt;a href=\"Governor%27s%20Hall\"&gt;Governor's Hall&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Caldera%20%28Morrowind%29\"&gt;Caldera&lt;/a&gt;) will task the Nerevarine with a simple courier task: hand the &lt;a href=\"Treasury%20Orders\"&gt;Treasury Orders&lt;/a&gt; to Tenisi Lladri. Of note, however, is the fact that Lladri is, in fact, the &lt;a href=\"Hlaalu%20Treasury\"&gt;treasury's assistant clerk&lt;/a&gt;, despite the fact that it would be expected to deliver the orders to his boss, Baren Alen. Helvi, however, states that these orders (which should not be opened), should not be handed to Alen under any circumstances.\nHelvi's suspicious activities.\nThe Nerevarine, at this point, faces a choice: do they hand the orders to their intended recipient Lladri (which would benefit Helvi), or do they turn them over to a more senior member of the house. This choice is up to the Nerevarine and, regardless of which option they choose, they will have to head to the &lt;a href=\"Vivec%2C%20Hlaalu%20Canton\"&gt;Hlaalu Canton&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Vivec%20City%20%28Morrowind%29\"&gt;Vivec City&lt;/a&gt;.\nHelping Helvi.\nShould the Nerevarine choose to help Helvi by giving the orders to Lladri, they will be required to head to the Treasury in the Hlaalu Canton waistworks. Lladri will be easy to find and will gratefully take the orders, rewarding the Nerevarine with 100 (his &lt;a href=\"disposition\"&gt;disposition&lt;/a&gt; will also increase by 10). Once delivered, the Nerevarine may return to Helvi to receive their next task.\nThe Good of the House.\nIf, however, the Nerevarine realises that Helvi's actions are harming the &lt;a href=\"House%20Hlaalu%20%28Morrowind%29\"&gt;house&lt;/a&gt;, then they can take the orders to a number of senior members in the House. Among them included Alen (the very man Helvi requested the orders not be seen by), Rovone Arvel or Crassius Curio (whom has had his own suspicions about Helvi). Either one of them will reward the Nerevarine with 500, as well as their personal thanks (with disposition boost).\nIt must be noted that giving the orders to Arvel or Alen will infuriate Helvi, costing the Nerevarine a large amount of disposition with Helvi. If the orders were handed to Curio, however, he will hide the Nerevarine's involvement with the orders getting to him, meaning that Helvi is unaware of the Nerevarine double crossed him."}

Disbanded and disgraced, those of us left with the decency of shame have scattered to the winds.

It seems, however, that Wind Scour does not hold the Horn of Ja'darri. And so we travel to Storm Talon next, in hopes that we may find the Dragonhorn within that sanctuary's halls."}

I know of no other Dragonhorn that had such a power. How was the &lt;a href=\"Dragonguard%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Dragonguard&lt;/a&gt; able to create this weapon?\nIt also makes me curious as to what matter of Dragon the Horn of Ja'darri was carved from. It must have been a truly powerful beast. Was he called Ja'darri? It seems unlikely, given the name's distinctly &lt;a href=\"Khajiit%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Khajiiti&lt;/a&gt; sound.\nLet us hope that when we find the Dragonhorn, so too shall we uncover its secrets."}

Alas, it seems that while the great &lt;a href=\"Dragonhorn\"&gt;Dragonhorn&lt;/a&gt; once rested within these halls, it has long since been stolen away. And, by the few accounts I could discover, I believe that the theft was performed by none other than a &lt;a href=\"Dragons%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Dragon&lt;/a&gt;.\nWhile it pains me to learn of such a grave dishonor to our order, I am more resolved than ever to get back what is rightfully ours.

Despite warnings about a &lt;a href=\"Dragons%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;dragon&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"Jarl\"&gt;Jarl&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"Whiterun%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Whiterun&lt;/a&gt; says that he cannot help with the effort to defeat it unless the &lt;a href=\"Skyrim%20Civil%20War\"&gt;Civil War&lt;/a&gt; is stopped. Only the &lt;a href=\"Greybeards\"&gt;Greybeards&lt;/a&gt; are in a position to hold a peace council.\nBackground.\n\"The Jarl of Whiterun won't help me capture a dragon as long as the civil war is raging. If I can get the Greybeards to host a peace council, I can try to convince the Imperial and the Stormcloaks to agree to a truce in order to defeat Alduin, who is a threat to both sides of the civil war.\"\nWalkthrough.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Last%20Dragonborn\"&gt;Dragonborn&lt;/a&gt; must talk to either &lt;a href=\"Paarthurnax%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Paarthurnax&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Arngeir\"&gt;Arngeir&lt;/a&gt;, or &lt;a href=\"Esbern%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Esbern&lt;/a&gt;. Whoever is picked will say that they must talk to the Jarl of Whiterun to try and convince him to let them use &lt;a href=\"Dragonsreach\"&gt;Dragonsreach&lt;/a&gt;, which was originally designed to capture and house a &lt;a href=\"Numinex\"&gt;dragon&lt;/a&gt;.\nJarl of Whiterun.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Last%20Dragonborn\"&gt;Dragonborn&lt;/a&gt; tries to enlist the aid of the Jarl of Whiterun. However, the Jarl will say that he cannot try to capture a dragon while &lt;a href=\"Whiterun%20Hold\"&gt;Whiterun&lt;/a&gt; is under threat of attack. He says that if a peace treaty can be agreed between the &lt;a href=\"Imperial%20Legion%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Imperials&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Stormcloaks\"&gt;Stormcloaks&lt;/a&gt;, he will help capture and hold a dragon. The Jarl will also suggest talking to the Greybeards, as both General Tullius and Ulfric Stormcloak highly respect them.\nShould the Dragonborn have already completed the &lt;a href=\"Skyrim%20Civil%20War\"&gt;Civil War&lt;/a&gt; questline and ended Skyrim's Civil War, or at least pursued the questline far enough that one side controls eight out of nine holds, then this quest will be automatically bypassed. Regardless of whether Whiterun is under the rule of &lt;a href=\"Balgruuf%20the%20Greater\"&gt;Balgruuf the Greater&lt;/a&gt; with the Legion or &lt;a href=\"Vignar%20Gray-Mane\"&gt;Vignar Gray-Mane&lt;/a&gt; with the Stormcloaks, the Jarl will agree to capture &lt;a href=\"Odahviing%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Odahviing&lt;/a&gt; without talking to the Greybeards, and the main questline will be continued.\nGetting the two sides to the table.\nThe Dragonborn will speak to the Greybeards, who will agree to help negotiate a truce. Arngeir will suggest the Dragonborn speak to both General Tullius and Ulfric Stormcloak, and extend an invitation to meet with the Greybeards and discuss the future of Skyrim.\nNote that if the Dragonborn has not yet chosen a side in the Civil War questline, then upon speaking with both General Tullius and Ulfric the first time, there will be no dialogue option to tell either about the peace conference. Instead, after mentioning &lt;a href=\"Helgen\"&gt;Helgen&lt;/a&gt;, each will assume that the Dragonborn wants to join their side. Each will direct them to their assistant (either &lt;a href=\"Legate%20Rikke%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Legate Rikke&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"Galmar%20Stone-Fist\"&gt;Galmar Stone-Fist&lt;/a&gt;), and in most cases they will then end the conversation. Approaching each one a second time will now present the option to tell them about the Greybeards and the conference.\nAfter speaking to both parties, returning to Arngeir and speaking with him will allow the conference to begin. However, &lt;a href=\"Delphine%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Delphine&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Esbern%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Esbern&lt;/a&gt; will show up demanding entrance to the conference, representing &lt;a href=\"the%20Blades\"&gt;the Blades&lt;/a&gt;. Arngeir initially refuses due to the Blades' past transgressions as dragon slayers, but is ultimately persuaded to permit them to join.\nPeace Treaty.\nOnce the peace conference has started, the Dragonborn is given a multitude of options, mostly having to do with the side taken in the Civil War questline.\nNegotiation 1: Elenwen.\nAs soon as the negotiations begin, Ulfric objects to &lt;a href=\"Elenwen%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Elenwen&lt;/a&gt; being involved in this council, saying how the &lt;a href=\"Thalmor%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Thalmor&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Aldmeri%20Dominion%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Aldmeri Dominion&lt;/a&gt; should have nothing to do with Skyrim's politics. Tullius or Ulfric will ask what the Dragonborn's thoughts are:\nThe choice made counts as a 'score' to the side the Dragonborn agrees with. Should the disappointed side not be favored in the next round, they may threaten to leave the negotiations, depending on the Dragonborn's stand in the Civil War. They never will, but will at least say that they feel they are treated unfairly.\nNegotiation 2: Markarth or Riften.\nThe next item to discuss is giving up a major Hold.\nIf the Dragonborn has sided with the Stormcloaks, General Tullius will demand that &lt;a href=\"Riften%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Riften&lt;/a&gt; be turned over to the &lt;a href=\"Empire\"&gt;Empire&lt;/a&gt;. Otherwise (either if sided with the Imperials or no side yet selected), Ulfric will demand &lt;a href=\"Markarth%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Markarth&lt;/a&gt; be surrendered to the Stormcloaks. The opposing faction's reaction depends on the state of the Civil War: The faction that controls Markarth or Riften asks the Dragonborn what they believe is a fair trade for the city.\nThe answer is one of three choices:\nThe council goes along with whatever choice is made. The side that controls Markarth or Riften will be unhappy if it is bargained for a minor Hold.\nNegotiation 3/NA (Through Console Command): Minor Hold.\nIf a &lt;a href=\"Console%20Commands%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;console command&lt;/a&gt; is used to do the mission when the Stormcloaks or the Imperials only have their capital left, the other side will down size their demand to a minor hold. Here the Dragonborn has the choice of surrendering a minor hold to the Imperials or the Stormcloaks. There is no difference in the speech other than at the end. If a minor hold is indeed given up, Tullius tells the Dragonborn of his displeasure. He does not use that speech if it is kept. The Stormcloaks will take the deal either way.\nNegotiation 4: Concessions.\nIt is now time for the faction that has been favored less (and thus \"losing\" the negotiations) to ask for additional concessions. For each demand, the Dragonborn can choose whether to agree to the concession. If the Dragonborn continues to favor one side, the other will eventually say that they will, after all, act for the greater good, and they will agree to the terms in any case.\nConclusion.\nOnce the treaty is agreed, the quest is complete. Arngeir summarizes the terms of the agreement, including the new Jarls appointed due to Holds exchanged. If the Dragonborn has joined a side, and the agreement is beneficial or neutral for their side, their chief negotiator (Tullius or Ulfric) will compliment the Dragonborn's efforts and reward them with a &lt;a href=\"leveled\"&gt;leveled&lt;/a&gt; weapon.\nAfter completing the peace treaty with both sides, the Civil War questline is halted until the &lt;a href=\"Main%20Quest%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;main quest&lt;/a&gt; has been fully completed with Alduin's death in \"&lt;a href=\"Dragonslayer\"&gt;Dragonslayer&lt;/a&gt;.\"\nIf the Dragonborn has sided with the Stormcloaks and has liberated &lt;a href=\"Falkreath%20Hold%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Falkreath&lt;/a&gt; in the questline \"&lt;a href=\"Liberation%20of%20Skyrim\"&gt;Liberation of Skyrim&lt;/a&gt;,\" in which the next objective is to liberate &lt;a href=\"the%20Reach\"&gt;the Reach&lt;/a&gt;, then it is possible that after completing \"Season Unending,\" the \"Liberate the Reach\" objective will also be complete. Note that the Liberation questline cannot be completed if the Dragonborn has a bounty in either Eastmarch or Haafingar.\nIf the Dragonborn has sided with the Legion and decides to trade the Reach for the Rift, then the quest \"&lt;a href=\"Compelling%20Tribute%20%28Imperials%29\"&gt;Compelling Tribute&lt;/a&gt;\" in the Civil War questline is skipped."}

The &lt;a href=\"Vestige\"&gt;Vestige&lt;/a&gt; entered a secluded grove near &lt;a href=\"Daggerfall%20Docks\"&gt;Daggerfall Harbor&lt;/a&gt; called &lt;a href=\"Bad%20Man%27s%20Hallows\"&gt;Bad Man's Hallows&lt;/a&gt;. The people here are engaged in a festival honoring the &lt;a href=\"Bad%20Man\"&gt;Bad Man&lt;/a&gt;, an ancient harvest god.\nWalkthrough.\nNicholas welcomes the Vestige to Bad Man's Hallows and the Harvest Festival. The Bad Man is one of the old gods. According to local tradition, appeasing him will ensure a good harvest. Superstitious nonsense, but an excellent excuse for a festival.\nTo appease the Bad Man we gather baskets of fresh apples and bags of hearty grain, then we burn them on the sacrificial altar, in his honor. Then comes the feast.\nGather a few apples and grain bags, then place the offerings on the altar. Then Curator Nicholas will perform a ritual, wait for him to finish it and then talk to him again. As a final step the Vestige must scatter dirt on the fire. According to the legend, \"Just as our crops feed on the soil of the Hallows, so too will the Bad Man feed\". It's also a tradition, so humor us. Go over to the fire and throw dirt on it.\nThe tunnels.\nThe sacrificial fire engulfed the Vestige who now finds themselves transported to a series of tunnels, probably under the tree. The tunnels are littered with scavengers and the dead. Fight the &lt;a href=\"Creatures%20%28Online%29\"&gt;creatures&lt;/a&gt; while moving forward in through the tunnel system until they find a woman trapped by the living roots.\nShe pleads to be freed and promise to explain everything as soon as she is free. She killed a &lt;a href=\"Shalk%20%28Online%29\"&gt;shalk&lt;/a&gt; before the roots grabbed her, go and cut out its fire gland, then use it to burn away these roots. Hurry over and cut the gland out of the shalk, then return and burn the roots and free Eveline.\nThanks for coming along, she says, we have a lot of work to do. That was no Harvest Festival, those people are &lt;a href=\"Daedra%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Daedra&lt;/a&gt; worshippers, and we're in terrible danger. We need to get out of these tunnels. We are directly under the tree, but it's not a tree. It's a minor Dremora lord. The tree's roots are the key, he channels dark energy through them to keep this pocket Oblivion from collapsing upon itself. Destroying the roots will hurt him. Using shalk glands to burn the roots in these caverns will weaken him. She'll be working on an escape while the Vestige burn the roots.\nFollow the markers to the tendril clusters that needs to be burned, if short on shalk glands there are few shalks to kill around in the tunnels. In one of the chambers a &lt;a href=\"Bosmer%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Bosmer&lt;/a&gt; named &lt;a href=\"Finvir\"&gt;Finvir&lt;/a&gt; can be found. Help him find &lt;a href=\"Can%27t%20Take%20it%20With%20Them\"&gt;the ceremonial gems&lt;/a&gt; he needs while burning the roots.\nReturn to Eveline when the burning has been done, she'll be waiting for the good news. By burning the roots, we've got the Bad Man's attention, he's angry and now we need to fight him. Take these shalk glands, we need to find a way to feed them directly to the Dremora.\nLet her know what the Curator Nicholas said about the offerings on the altar. She is surprised that he is alive, that traitor. He was part of their circle, if he's alive he made a deal with the Dremora. The altar may be the answer, the Vestige needs to get back to the glen. Go through the portal back to &lt;a href=\"Glenumbra%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Glenumbra&lt;/a&gt;.\nBack in the glen.\nIt's a total devastation in the glen, everyone seems to have died but Nicholas, he is sitting down against a tree, injured. Go over and talk to him to find out what happened. The Bad Man's anger came after the Vestige were consumed in the flame. He became enraged and turned on us, rained death upon the grove. It was consumed in fire. What happened down there he asks. Explain to him about the shalk glands and burning of the roots and he says that this of course can be the only way to defeat him. Burn those glands at the altar, he'll be forced to consume them and they'll burn him from the inside out. Hurry, it's our only chance!\nRun over to the altar and place the shalk glands, then wait for the Dremora to appear. Fight him and defeat him, then return to Eveline who has come back from the tunnels. She felt a shift in the planes, is it done? We should leave this place now, with the Daedra banished the glen will collapse in upon itself. Thanks for all the help and she does hope the Vestige will have the good taste to not mention her involvement in all this."}

The &lt;a href=\"Khajiit\"&gt;Khajiit&lt;/a&gt; of the &lt;a href=\"Elsweyr%20Confederacy\"&gt;Elsweyr Confederacy&lt;/a&gt; also struck a treaty with the Dominion.\nThe Aldmeri Dominion was the most stable power in &lt;a href=\"Tamriel\"&gt;Tamriel&lt;/a&gt; until the coming of &lt;a href=\"Tiber%20Septim\"&gt;Tiber Septim&lt;/a&gt;, whose conquest of Summerset is remembered by many living Altmer with horror, only partially diminished by time.\nBackground.\nFormation.\nIn the late &lt;a href=\"First%20Era\"&gt;First Era&lt;/a&gt; the ancestors of Camoran Anaxemes,\u00a0heir to the Valenwood throne, made a pact with the Aldmeri Council in a treaty between Summerset and Valenwood. One thousand years later at the end of the &lt;a href=\"Interregnum\"&gt;Interregnum&lt;/a&gt; in 2E 830, the heirs of the &lt;a href=\"Camoran%20Dynasty\"&gt;Camoran Dynasty&lt;/a&gt; began to fight over the throne. One faction of Bosmer offered to give up territory to the Colovians of &lt;a href=\"Colovia\"&gt;West Cyrodiil&lt;/a&gt;, in exchange for the support of their own claimant to the throne. The High Elves responded by establishing a provisional government, the &lt;a href=\"Thalmor\"&gt;Thalmor&lt;/a&gt;, on behalf of Camoran Anaxemes. The Colovians were quickly driven back by the Aldmeri army, and the other heirs to the throne were silenced. Camoran Anaxemes swore 50 years of allegiance to the King of &lt;a href=\"Summerset%20Isles\"&gt;Alinor&lt;/a&gt; for his support, and thus the Aldmeri Dominion was born.\nGovernment and Politics.\nThe Thalmor was a congress of Bosmeri chieftains and Altmeri diplomats, and proved better than the chaos of the previous years. The Dominion's allies included the &lt;a href=\"Khajiit\"&gt;Khajiit&lt;/a&gt; of the &lt;a href=\"Elsweyr%20Confederacy\"&gt;Elsweyr Confederacy&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"Maormer\"&gt;Maormer&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"Pyandonea\"&gt;Pyandonea&lt;/a&gt;, and also a few &lt;a href=\"Reachmen\"&gt;Reachmen&lt;/a&gt;. During this time &lt;a href=\"Tamriel\"&gt;Tamriel&lt;/a&gt; was divided between the &lt;a href=\"Septim%20Empire\"&gt;Empire&lt;/a&gt; and the Dominion, although the Thalmor did have representatives at the &lt;a href=\"Imperial%20City\"&gt;Imperial City&lt;/a&gt;. For the duration of the Dominion, the Thalmor changed Valenwood's capital from &lt;a href=\"Falinesti\"&gt;Falinesti&lt;/a&gt; to &lt;a href=\"Elden%20Root\"&gt;Elden Root&lt;/a&gt;.\nDissolution.\nTiber Septim had originally planned to send &lt;a href=\"Zurin%20Arctus\"&gt;Zurin Arctus&lt;/a&gt; to the King of Alinor in order to make peace between the Empire and the Aldmeri Dominion. However, after the Empire's invasion of &lt;a href=\"Morrowind\"&gt;Morrowind&lt;/a&gt;, pieces of &lt;a href=\"Numidium\"&gt;Numidium&lt;/a&gt; began to trickle in, and Tiber Septim had Zurin Arctus research the artifact instead. After having discovered what Numidium was, Tiber Septim used it to conquer the Summerset Isles, an event that is still remembered by many living Altmer with horror. The Thalmor did not endure Tiber Septim's armies, and gradually the Bosmer began to grow resentful of the Empire, an authority which seemed increasingly alien."}

After &lt;a href=\"Hammerfell\"&gt;Hammerfell&lt;/a&gt; fell to the Empire, &lt;a href=\"Lord%20Amiel%20Richton\"&gt;Lord Amiel Richton&lt;/a&gt; was assigned as the provincial governor of the isle territory of &lt;a href=\"Stros%20M%27Kai\"&gt;Stros M'Kai&lt;/a&gt;.\nHowever, some of the remaining &lt;a href=\"Crowns\"&gt;Crowns&lt;/a&gt; still continued to resist the &lt;a href=\"Septim%20Empire\"&gt;Empire&lt;/a&gt;, most notably a renegade group of pirates called the &lt;a href=\"Restless%20League\"&gt;Restless League&lt;/a&gt;. The League would raid &lt;a href=\"Imperial\"&gt;Imperial&lt;/a&gt; vessels as they came and went, taking cargo and weapons meant for the &lt;a href=\"Imperial%20Legion%20%28Redguard%29\"&gt;Legion&lt;/a&gt; and throwing them overboard, all whilst robbing merchants, &lt;a href=\"Forebears\"&gt;Forebears&lt;/a&gt; and Imperial citizens. In the aftermath of the Crowns disastrous defeat, the League somehow managed to get its hands on the &lt;a href=\"soul%20gem\"&gt;soul gem&lt;/a&gt; which contained &lt;a href=\"Prince%20A%27Tor\"&gt;Prince A'Tor&lt;/a&gt; life force, thought to have perished either by assassin's poison or dragon's fire. While they deliberated the next course of action, A'Tor's friend and lover &lt;a href=\"Iszara\"&gt;Iszara&lt;/a&gt; grew impatient and decided to steal the gem and take it to the &lt;a href=\"Sload\"&gt;Sload&lt;/a&gt; necromancer &lt;a href=\"N%27Gasta\"&gt;N'Gasta&lt;/a&gt;, where she was ultimately captured and put into a lucid state. Her brother &lt;a href=\"Cyrus\"&gt;Cyrus&lt;/a&gt; arrived shortly thereafter and freed her, where he then joined his sister and the League in their plans to resurrect the fallen monarch and bring the fight to the Empire once more.\nUsing the key to the palace's treasure vault, Cyrus snuck into the lair of &lt;a href=\"Nafaalilargus\"&gt;Nafaalilargus&lt;/a&gt; and slew him, securing the lost gem in the process. Without the &lt;a href=\"dragon\"&gt;dragon&lt;/a&gt;, Richton no longer had the advantage that played so large a part in the previous engagment.\nIn the dead of night, Cyrus brought the &lt;a href=\"Yokuda\"&gt;Yokuda&lt;/a&gt;n gypsy woman &lt;a href=\"Saban\"&gt;Saban&lt;/a&gt; to the &lt;a href=\"Temple%20of%20Arkay%20%28Redguard%29\"&gt;Temple of Arkay&lt;/a&gt;, where the prince's body lay securely hidden. Meanwhile, the Restless League docked just outside of port and proceeded to quickly and quietly eliminate the town guards. In the ritual that was to bind the soul gem with Prince A'Tor body, whether by accident or by fate, his soul was instead imbued within his &lt;a href=\"Soul%20Sword\"&gt;sword&lt;/a&gt;. With the rebel forces having nearly lost heart, the swashbuckler Cyrus took up the blade, declaring this was a sign of the Prince's true intent, and rallied the Crowns to take to their ships and hold off the Imperial forces while he went to the palace and confronted Lord Richton himself.\nMeanwhile, Richton's personnel had acquired a scavenged &lt;a href=\"Airship\"&gt;Dwemer Airship&lt;/a&gt; which they had planned to use to assault the &lt;a href=\"Restless%20League%27s%20Hideout\"&gt;Restless League's Hideout&lt;/a&gt;. However, with the rebellion now sparked and League taking the harbor by surprise, the governor changed his plans and instead intended to use the airship to escape to the mainland, where he would then return later with a sizable navy. Cyrus however got to the dirigible before it could take off and defeated the bureaucrat one-on-one in a duel. The &lt;a href=\"Dunmer%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;dunmeri&lt;/a&gt; assassin &lt;a href=\"Dram\"&gt;Dram&lt;/a&gt; momentarily managed to hold Cyrus at knife-point, when suddenly the sword of A'Tor took on a life of its own and swung wildly in the air of its own volition, killing both Lord Richton and Dram with a single blow. Cyrus then proceeded to destroy the airship and land safely on a nearby building while the rebels cheered in the distance, the battle now won.\nAftermath.\nWhen word reached Hammerfell of the Restless rebellion, the &lt;a href=\"Forebear\"&gt;Forebear&lt;/a&gt; leader &lt;a href=\"Baron%20Volag\"&gt;Baron Volag&lt;/a&gt; came out of hiding and retook the capital of &lt;a href=\"Sentinel\"&gt;Sentinel&lt;/a&gt;. After two bloody wars in as many years, &lt;a href=\"Tiber%20Septim\"&gt;Tiber Septim&lt;/a&gt; was prepared to redraft a &lt;a href=\"Treaty%20of%20Stros%20M%27kai\"&gt;treaty&lt;/a&gt; that re-incorporated Hammerfell into the Empire as respected allies, rather then exploited subjects. This would also mark an era of peace between the Crowns and Forebears untill Civil War once again came to Hammerfell in &lt;a href=\"4E%20168\"&gt;4E 168&lt;/a&gt;."}

Led by &lt;a href=\"Captain\"&gt;Captain&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Tertius%20Ione\"&gt;Tertius Ione&lt;/a&gt;, the company managed to beat back the &lt;a href=\"Daedra\"&gt;Daedra&lt;/a&gt; and close the &lt;a href=\"Oblivion%20Gate\"&gt;Oblivion Gate&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;ref name=\"2/3\"&gt;, \"Part Two\", \"Chapter Three\"&lt;/ref&gt;\nPrelude.\nThe events surrounding this Oblivion Gate began when a company of Legionnaires was recalled to the &lt;a href=\"Imperial%20City\"&gt;Imperial City&lt;/a&gt; to reinforce it against a possible Daedric assault. While traveling through the &lt;a href=\"West%20Weald\"&gt;West Weald&lt;/a&gt;, the company was disrupted by the sudden opening of an Oblivion Gate, from whence Daedra appeared and fell upon them. More than half the company, including the commander, were slain; those that survived rallied to Captain Tertius Ione, who led the retreat from the gate. But Ione was determined to take vengeance on the Daedra and prevent the gate from menacing the country. He recruited local hunters and farmers from the countryside and the nearby town of &lt;a href=\"Pell%27s%20Gate\"&gt;Pell's Gate&lt;/a&gt;. Training them into soldiers, Ione led his new militia and the remnants of his company back to the gate to settle the score.\nBattle.\nAt the gate, Ione and his new company fell upon the Daedra, catching them by surprise and slaughtering them all with little or no casualties. Once the exterior of the gate was theirs, Ione divided his company, leaving half of them behind to guard the gate while he took the other half into the portal, and &lt;a href=\"Oblivion%20%28Realm%29\"&gt;Oblivion&lt;/a&gt; itself. Within &lt;a href=\"Mehrunes%20Dagon\"&gt;Dagon's&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Deadlands\"&gt;Deadlands&lt;/a&gt;, Ione and his men fought their way to the Sigillum Sanguis at the top of the Sigil Keep; there, they were met with overwhelming resistance. Determined that the gate had to be closed, Ione charged one of his men, a &lt;a href=\"Bosmer\"&gt;Bosmer&lt;/a&gt; named &lt;a href=\"Fenton\"&gt;Fenton&lt;/a&gt; with retrieving the tower's &lt;a href=\"Sigil%20Stone\"&gt;Sigil Stone&lt;/a&gt; while he and the rest of the company held off the Daedra. Though Ione and his men died in their final stand, Fenton did succeed in reaching the Sigil Stone and removing the Oblivion Gate's anchor to &lt;a href=\"Mundus\"&gt;Mundus&lt;/a&gt;. The gate was closed.\nAftermath.\nFenton was deposited back in &lt;a href=\"Cyrodiil\"&gt;Cyrodiil&lt;/a&gt;, and was found weeks later near death and half mad. He died one day after haggardly relating the events that took place in the gate. The other half of Ione's company that had stayed behind to guard the gate's exterior had built a small camp of fortifications and buildings to defend against any emerging Daedra. Following the gate's closing, some of the militia decided to stay at the camp, finding the area a suddenly safe place to settle. Within forty years, the camp had grown into a small yet prosperous town, given the name &lt;a href=\"Ione\"&gt;Ione&lt;/a&gt;, in honor of the brave captain that had saved the countryside and led them to victory."}

During the years following its collapse, several pretender states claimed succession to the Reman Empire, though none would last until the coronation of &lt;a href=\"Tiber%20Septim\"&gt;Tiber Septim&lt;/a&gt; as the true heir to the Reman line in &lt;a href=\"2E%20854\"&gt;2E 854&lt;/a&gt;.\nHistory.\nReman Cyrodiil's Reign (1E 2703\u20131E 2762).\nThe Legend.\nAccording to legend, &lt;a href=\"Reman\"&gt;Reman&lt;/a&gt; was the son of the &lt;a href=\"Colovian\"&gt;Colovian&lt;/a&gt; King Hrol from the lands beyond Lost Twil, who sought to heal the long split Kingdoms of &lt;a href=\"Colovia\"&gt;Colovia&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Nibenay\"&gt;Nibenay&lt;/a&gt; as a means to ward off the prophesized &lt;a href=\"Akaviri%20Invasion\"&gt;Akaviri Invasion&lt;/a&gt;. On one of his quests, King Hrol found the spirit of &lt;a href=\"Alessia\"&gt;Alessia&lt;/a&gt; who held the long lost &lt;a href=\"Amulet%20of%20Kings\"&gt;Amulet of Kings&lt;/a&gt;. In order to unify the &lt;a href=\"Cyrodiil\"&gt;Cyrodiil&lt;/a&gt;, Alessia's spirit, which took the physical form of a hillock, was impregnated by Hrol, who would die from his labors. After many months the mound of mud grew into the legendary hill of &lt;a href=\"Sancre%20Tor\"&gt;Sancre Tor&lt;/a&gt;, in which at its peak, the shepherdess Sed-Yenna found an infant she named \"Reman,\" who bore the Amulet of Kings in his forehead. The shepherdess then brought the infant Reman to the &lt;a href=\"White-Gold%20Tower\"&gt;White-Gold Tower&lt;/a&gt; and she placed him on the &lt;a href=\"Ruby%20Throne\"&gt;Ruby Throne&lt;/a&gt; without protest, where Reman stated \u201cI AM CYRODIIL COME\u201d and from then on ruled Cyrodiil. The legends of Reman further claim that at twelve years old he single-handedly crushed a major revolt, with the Colovian's taking up arms to break free of his unworthy rulership. The Colovian Kings would all swear fealty to him by the age of thirteen. Whether these Legends hold any truth is unknown, though it is often scoffed at by many scholars who view it as nothing more than propaganda designed to glorify and legitimize the Reman Dynasty. The only known contemporary reference to a \"Hrol\" outside of the legend is to a northern from Unsgrad who purportedly \"set out from lands beyond Lost Twil.\" It is believed this man may be the general basis of Reman's legend, which some scholars claim can't be reliably dated beyond the mid-&lt;a href=\"Second%20Era\"&gt;Second Era&lt;/a&gt;. It has been speculated that Reman was a bastard &lt;a href=\"Nord\"&gt;Nord&lt;/a&gt; born to Hrol, who died of exhaustion mating with the young shepardess Sed-Yenna. According to this theory, Sed Yenna cleverly fabricated the legend to employ factions that would support Reman being placed on the throne. If the legends are fraudulent, it is unknown how Reman managed to gain possession of the Amulet of Kings.\nThe Akaviri Invasion.\nThe accepted truth of Reman's reign holds that he was a general of the Colovian West and was responsible for rallying the armies of the &lt;a href=\"Nibenay%20Valley\"&gt;Nibenay Valley&lt;/a&gt; alongside his own Colovian legions in the fight against perhaps the greatest foreign invasion in Tamrielic history. In &lt;a href=\"1E%202703\"&gt;1E 2703&lt;/a&gt; the whole of northern Tamriel fell under attack by the armies of the serpentine Tsaesci, with the Nords of Skyrim facing the brunt of the attack. While the Nords fought fiercely, their forces were no match for the Akaviri who quickly cut through Skyrim. Presumably fearing the Akaviri would extend their invasion into the heartland, Reman persuaded the fractious human kingdoms of the &lt;a href=\"Alessian%20Empire\"&gt;previous Empire&lt;/a&gt; to lend him their armies and march against the Akaviri. Reman would wage war on the Akaviri in every region of the north, erecting many of the &lt;a href=\"Forts%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;old fortresses&lt;/a&gt; that dotted Skyrim as a protective shield against the Tsaesci. This war eventually culminated with the &lt;a href=\"Battle%20of%20Pale%20Pass\"&gt;Battle of Pale Pass&lt;/a&gt;. Knowing that the Akaviri forces were commanded from a hidden post in the &lt;a href=\"Jerall%20Mountains\"&gt;Jerall Mountains&lt;/a&gt;, Reman focused his forces along the &lt;a href=\"Pale%20Pass\"&gt;Pale Pass&lt;/a&gt;, believing his foes would stage their attack from there. Given time, Reman's intuition was proven correct and his army halted the Akaviri advance while &lt;a href=\"Vivec\"&gt;Vivec&lt;/a&gt;, commanding the armies of &lt;a href=\"Morrowind\"&gt;Morrowind&lt;/a&gt;, swooped in to intercept the Akaviri from behind, cutting off their reinforcements and supplies. A short battle ensued before the Akaviri abruptly surrendered en masse before Reman Cyrodiil. Hearing his voice, they fell to their knees before him revealing that he was who they sought after, they swore fealty and proclaimed him the legendary &lt;a href=\"Dragonborn\"&gt;Dragonborn&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe New Cyrodiil.\nImpressed by their exotic weaponry and battle-prowess, Reman was more than happy to accept the Akaviri invaders into his ranks. The captured Akaviri horde was awarded amnesty in return for them making the up the bulk of Reman's new personal army, the &lt;a href=\"Dragonguard\"&gt;Dragonguard&lt;/a&gt;. With the war over, Cyrodiil not only found itself united under Reman's rule, but also responsible for the protection of the weakened northern kingdoms of High Rock and Skyrim. With his new Dragonguard, Reman was determined to pacify the whole of Tamriel under his rulership. Reman's reign saw Cyrodiil become cosmopolitan, incorporating aspects of various &lt;a href=\"Breton\"&gt;Breton&lt;/a&gt;, Colovian, Nibenese, and Akaviri cultures into a common whole. While the Akaviri fancied Reman as the emperor, he would never actually be officially coronated as such within his lifetime.\nIn &lt;a href=\"1E%202704\"&gt;1E 2704&lt;/a&gt;, with the Akaviri no longer a threat Reman directed his attention to &lt;a href=\"the%20Reach\"&gt;the Reach&lt;/a&gt;. Reman sliced the Reach in-between Imperial-controlled High Rock and Skyrim, limiting the &lt;a href=\"Reachmen\"&gt;Reachmen&lt;/a&gt;'s ability to ally and plot against him and equally splitting the regions many mines between the two kingdoms. Armies from &lt;a href=\"Evermore\"&gt;Evermore&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Solitude\"&gt;Solitude&lt;/a&gt; were often sent in to tame the region's wild populace and introduce them to a proper economy. Reman began again the process of human conquest and expansion, founding a once more strong Cyrodilic nation. As the &lt;a href=\"Elves\"&gt;Elves&lt;/a&gt; grew wary of Reman's renewed human imperialism, so too did Reman grow wary of the Elves. In &lt;a href=\"1E%202714\"&gt;1E 2714&lt;/a&gt;, after being devastated from relentless warfare and the &lt;a href=\"Thrassian%20Plague\"&gt;Thrassian Plague&lt;/a&gt;, the Elven Kingdom of &lt;a href=\"Valenwood\"&gt;Valenwood&lt;/a&gt; fell to the forces of Reman. In order to assure the &lt;a href=\"Bosmer\"&gt;Bosmer&lt;/a&gt; would never unite against his occupation, Reman deposed the &lt;a href=\"Camoran%20Dynasty\"&gt;Camoran Dynasty&lt;/a&gt; and split Valenwood amongst varying independent &lt;a href=\"Treethane\"&gt;Treethane&lt;/a&gt;s so that they would never again find a common enemy. Valenwood ended up being a small prize for Reman, deemed by many to be a wasteland province. The Bosmer, due to their strict &lt;a href=\"Green%20Pact\"&gt;nature laws&lt;/a&gt;, had no traditional cities, therefore every municipality within Valenwood grew from trade posts established by the Empire. The construction of roads within the province was approved by the natives, but they were neglected of maintenance and fell into obscurity.\nReman would at some point take the surname \"Cyrodiil\" to inspire a sense of pride and connection to his people and homeland.\nReman would also institute the coronation rites that would be used by succeeding emperors, including the ritual geas of the Amulet of Kings. His reign would last until his death in the year &lt;a href=\"1E%202762\"&gt;1E 2762&lt;/a&gt;, the causes of which are unknown. Tracing his ancestry to the &lt;a href=\"Saint%20Alessia\"&gt;Saint Alessia&lt;/a&gt;, Reman built splendid funeral precincts with the city of &lt;a href=\"Sancre%20Tor\"&gt;Sancre Tor&lt;/a&gt; ancient underpassages, where he and his descendants would be entombed. Sancre Tor would see a brief resurgence in wealth and culture during his reign, and those of his descendants. Sometime after his death, Reman began to be worshiped as \"The Cyrodiil\" or the \"Worldly God,\" a cultural god-hero of the Second Empire, adored as a great conquering deity. He is assumed to have been succeeded by his probable son, &lt;a href=\"Kastav\"&gt;Kastav&lt;/a&gt;.\nKastav's Reign (1E 2762\u20131E 2806).\nEmperor Kastav was the first known ruler of Reman's line to take the title equivalent of \"Emperor,\" though whether or not he actually formed the titular \"Reman Empire\" is unknown. His rulership was marked by its notable incompetence in comparison to the other rulers of the &lt;a href=\"Reman%20Dynasty\"&gt;Reman Dynasty&lt;/a&gt;. Kastav was known to employ a \"Minister of Punition,\" a title in which was held by Excoraeus of &lt;a href=\"House%20Tharn\"&gt;House Tharn&lt;/a&gt;.\nEmperor Kastav enforced overwhelming levies on his vassals, often having his Dragonguard seize hostages from neighboring lands to make sure their lords met their assigned conscription quotas. His excessive military actions were often objected by the leaders of the Dragonguard, but to no avail. By the break out of the &lt;a href=\"Winterhold%20Rebellion\"&gt;Winterhold Rebellion&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"1E%202804\"&gt;1E 2804&lt;/a&gt;, no doubt in protest of Kastav's oppression, the Master of the &lt;a href=\"Sky%20Haven%20Temple\"&gt;Sky Haven Temple&lt;/a&gt; outright refused Kastav's call to arms, backed by the Grandmaster's claim that the order broke the \"Oath of Allegiance\". In response Emperor Kastav cut off the Temple's supplies, and eventually besieged the Temple in &lt;a href=\"1E%202805\"&gt;1E 2805&lt;/a&gt;. The Akaviri &lt;a href=\"Kalien\"&gt;Kalien&lt;/a&gt;, who was denied entry to the Dragonguard, sacked the city of &lt;a href=\"Winterhold%20%28City%29\"&gt;Winterhold&lt;/a&gt;. Kalien's presence gave the appearance that the Dragonguard had committed the sacking, thus ruining their reputation in Skyrim. The siege would be lifted in the year &lt;a href=\"1E%202806\"&gt;1E 2806&lt;/a&gt;, after Kastav was deposed under unknown circumstances and replaced on the throne by &lt;a href=\"Reman%20Cyrodiil%20II\"&gt;Reman II&lt;/a&gt;.\nReman II's Reign (1E 2806 - 1E 2851).\nEmperor Reman II is often viewed as one of the most magnificent rulers of the Reman Empire, his glory only surpassed by Reman himself. Because of this, Reman II, much like Reman himself, is subject to many legends surrounding, most notably, his birth. Most scholars state that Reman II was a grandson to Reman, who resembled his grandfather in all ways save for his fair hair and stature inherited from his &lt;a href=\"Nord\"&gt;Nord&lt;/a&gt;ic mother. Myth, however, holds that Reman II was the destined heir to Reman himself, born thirty years after his father's death from, variously, a cow, a river, a dragon, or a combination of these and other things.\nGolden Age of the Second Empire.\nReman II took the throne as acting emperor in &lt;a href=\"1E%202806\"&gt;1E 2806&lt;/a&gt; after the deposition of the inadequate Kastav, evidently twelve years of age at the time. Reman II, though still young, quickly demonstrated his diplomatic prowess, negotiating a swift end to the Winterhold rebellion erupted by his precursor. In the year &lt;a href=\"1E%202811\"&gt;1E 2811&lt;/a&gt;, Imperial forces made early progress in the conquest of the &lt;a href=\"Argonian\"&gt;Argonian&lt;/a&gt; people, cutting deep into the region's borderlands in the easily won &lt;a href=\"Battle%20of%20Argonia\"&gt;Battle of Argonia&lt;/a&gt;. By the year &lt;a href=\"1E%202812\"&gt;1E 2812&lt;/a&gt;, the annexed territory was officially incorporated into Imperial governance as \"&lt;a href=\"Black%20Marsh\"&gt;Black Marsh&lt;/a&gt;.\" This year also saw the official coronation of Reman II as emperor, now at the matured age of eighteen, using his Imperial authority to permit his Dragonguard to construct &lt;a href=\"Alduin%27s%20Wall\"&gt;Alduin's Wall&lt;/a&gt;.\nReman II would go on to bring about a golden age within the Second Empire through his unmatched diplomatic and tactical genius. His martial acumen was likely responsible for the conquest of &lt;a href=\"Hammerfell\"&gt;Hammerfell&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"Khajiit\"&gt;Khajiit&lt;/a&gt; kingdoms, and possibly the &lt;a href=\"Summerset%20Isles\"&gt;Summerset Isles&lt;/a&gt;, though certain sources imply the &lt;a href=\"Altmer\"&gt;Altmer&lt;/a&gt; may have straightforwardly submitted to Reman II in fear of conflict. When admitting new territories into the Empire, Reman II did so with a careful hand, avoiding the disruption of local cultures and traditions, as well as established trade. Reman II gathered advisers from the annexed lands to keep focus on their respective populations. Given time, the conquered peoples began to accept and support the Second Empire, reaping the benefits of free trade, political stability, and improved infrastructure. Under Reman II's rulership, &lt;a href=\"Necromancy\"&gt;Necromancy&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Daedra\"&gt;Daedra&lt;/a&gt; worship were abolished, trade flourished, and order was brought across Tamriel. Many great fortresses were constructed during Reman II's reign, including Skyspire keep in &lt;a href=\"Betony\"&gt;Betony&lt;/a&gt;, and likely &lt;a href=\"Fort%20Sphinxmoth\"&gt;Fort Sphinxmoth&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Elsweyr\"&gt;Elsweyr&lt;/a&gt;. Reman II's affluent reign eventually embellished the idea of a great \"Reman Dynasty,\" with Reman I being viewed as the idealized founder of the Reman Empire.\nIt is likely that the dynasty's attempts to reach &lt;a href=\"Aetherius\"&gt;Aetherius&lt;/a&gt; occurred during this period, although this cannot be confirmed from present sources.\nThe Blackwater War.\nWhile the rest of Tamriel thrived, continued Imperial expansion into Argonia did not prove quite as prosperous. The second phase of the Black Marsh campaign, the Blackwater War, led by the young General Bucco, ended after nine years in &lt;a href=\"1E%202820\"&gt;1E 2820&lt;/a&gt;, a complete disaster resulting with the destruction of the entire Fourth Legion and little to no territorial gains. In order to avoid appearing weak due to Bucco's inexperience, the &lt;a href=\"Elder%20Council\"&gt;Elder Council&lt;/a&gt; reconstituted the Fourth Legion and once more renewed the Blackwater invasion, led by the much more competent General Sardecus. Under Sardecus' strict regiment, the Empire regained all of Bucco's lost territory by the year &lt;a href=\"1E%202823\"&gt;1E 2823&lt;/a&gt;. Sardecus tripled the size of his forces by allying himself with the disenfranchised Argonian tribes, and issued the tedious process of fighting the swamp itself, deconstructing it through various means. However, Sardecus' demolitions ended up bringing a halt to his campaign in &lt;a href=\"1E%202828\"&gt;1E 2828&lt;/a&gt;, when sappers set fire to a large peat bog unknowingly part of a massive underground network that traversed the entire region. This event, referred to as the \"Great Burn,\" began to erupt fires randomly in areas as far as &lt;a href=\"Soulrest\"&gt;Soulrest&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Gideon\"&gt;Gideon&lt;/a&gt; eventually spreading throughout the entire area, fueled by swamp gas. The burned lands were rendered uninhabitable and many troops succumbed to diseases brought about by toxic fumes, forcing the legion to retreat. In the 2830's Reman II began to focus on the province, with the slow conquest weighing heavy on him. Reman II renewed the conquest of the region once more in &lt;a href=\"1E%202833\"&gt;1E 2833&lt;/a&gt;, placing the Fourth Legion under the command of General Lucinia Falco. Falco split her forces into hundreds of smaller units, using them to push through the swamp on many fronts, and privateers were used to land Imperial marines in southern coastal territories. The Blackwater War evolved into complex guerilla war, and for the two years after &lt;a href=\"1E%202834\"&gt;1E 2834&lt;/a&gt;, each side orchestrated various intimidation tactics on each other. In later years, infighting began to break out amongst the various Argonian tribes, and the war would come to abrupt end in &lt;a href=\"1E%202836\"&gt;1E 2836&lt;/a&gt; after the Argonians merely refused to continue fighting and returned to their homes. With the war inexplicably over, the Empire quickly claimed the territory in &lt;a href=\"1E%202837\"&gt;1E 2837&lt;/a&gt;, with Reman II officially creating the province of Black Marsh.\nBeginning the War with Morrowind.\nInstead of learning from the long and bloody war for Black Marsh, Reman II was emboldened by his victory and grew even more ambitious, turning his gaze to &lt;a href=\"Morrowind\"&gt;Morrowind&lt;/a&gt;. In &lt;a href=\"1E%202840\"&gt;1E 2840&lt;/a&gt;, after growing mistrust between the two nations, Reman II declared war on Morrowind, completely shattering their already tenuous relations. This war would devastate both sides and result with Emperor Reman II's death in battle against the &lt;a href=\"Dunmer\"&gt;Dunmer&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"1E%202851\"&gt;1E 2851&lt;/a&gt;. The &lt;a href=\"Four%20Score%20War\"&gt;Four Score War&lt;/a&gt;, as it would come to be called, continued to be waged by Reman II's heirs, bleeding the Empire's resources dry and bringing an end to the golden age he worked so hard to create. Reman II would be succeeded by &lt;a href=\"Brazollus%20Dor\"&gt;Brazollus Dor&lt;/a&gt;.\nBrazollus Dor's Reign (1E 2851\u20131E 2877).\nEmperor Brazollus Dor was the successor to Reman II, and he continued to wage the war Reman II started. Like Reman and Reman II before him, Brazollus Dor bravely fought in the vanguard of his battles, though the war still remained a stalemate through the entirety of his reign. Dor was not a particularly capable ruler and was very disinterested in matters of state. All the details of rule and issues of policy and politics were assigned to his capable potentate Sidri-Ashak, Dor preferring to instead spend his time at his country estate near &lt;a href=\"Skingrad\"&gt;Skingrad&lt;/a&gt;. Emperor Brazollus Dor would be succeeded by his heir, Reman III, after his inferred death in &lt;a href=\"1E%202877\"&gt;1E 2877&lt;/a&gt;.\nReman III's Reign (1E 2877 - 1E 2920).\nEmperor Reman III was the rightful heir to Brazollus Dor and he too would continue the war in Morrowind, begun by his grandfather. Reman III was believed to be plagued by constant paranoia, trusting only the people very close to him. Reman III's paranoia was possibly brought on by his wife, &lt;a href=\"Empress%20Tavia\"&gt;Tavia&lt;/a&gt;'s, betrayal in &lt;a href=\"1E%202899\"&gt;1E 2899&lt;/a&gt;, whom he had locked away near &lt;a href=\"Gideon\"&gt;Gideon&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe Last Year of the First Era.\nEmperor Reman III was wisely advised by his Potentate, &lt;a href=\"Versidue-Shaie\"&gt;Versidue-Shaie&lt;/a&gt;, to lead his armies from the rear to make certain he would not die in battle, or from more insidious means. In the year &lt;a href=\"1E%202920\"&gt;1E 2920&lt;/a&gt;, after suffering a crushing defeat at the border territory of &lt;a href=\"Bodrum\"&gt;Bodrum&lt;/a&gt;, Reman III was forced to retreat his army back to Cyrodiil. However, Reman III's gifted son, Prince &lt;a href=\"Juilek\"&gt;Juilek&lt;/a&gt;, managed to achieve an important strategic victory at the stronghold of &lt;a href=\"Ald%20Marak\"&gt;Ald Marak&lt;/a&gt;, turning the tide of the war in the Empire's favor. Realizing the war could only now bring ruin to Morrowind, Vivec met with Prince Juilek to sue for peace. It was eventually agreed that Morrowind would surrender its coastline, as well as other strategic fortresses such as Ald Marak, Ald Umbeil, &lt;a href=\"Tel%20Aruhn\"&gt;Tel Aruhn&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Ald%20Lambasi\"&gt;Ald Lambasi&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Tel%20Mothrivra\"&gt;Tel Mothrivra&lt;/a&gt;. In return, the Empire would cease all hostilities against Morrowind and allow the nation to expand into territories of Black Marsh the Empire deemed unnecessary. However, this treaty would be postponed multiple times for several reasons. The first being the sacking of &lt;a href=\"Black%20Gate\"&gt;Black Gate&lt;/a&gt;, orchestrated by Reman III's armies, then the assassination of Prince Juilek at &lt;a href=\"Dorsza%20Pass\"&gt;Dorsza Pass&lt;/a&gt; who held the signed treaty. It was eventually decided that Reman III would sign the treaty in person at the &lt;a href=\"White-Gold%20Tower\"&gt;White-Gold Tower&lt;/a&gt;. However, before the treaty could be signed, Reman III's paranoia was proven correct and he was assassinated by an associate of the &lt;a href=\"Morag%20Tong\"&gt;Morag Tong&lt;/a&gt;; slain at the treacherous order of who many assume to be his trusted Potentate, Versidue-Shaie. As Reman III died with no living heirs, trouble ensued over who would succeed him. The &lt;a href=\"Elder%20Council\"&gt;Elder Council&lt;/a&gt; refused to acknowledge the claims of the Dynasty's distant cousins and instead installed Potentate Versidue Shaie as the acting ruler of the Empire. The Potentate's first act was honoring the emperor's treaty, meeting Vivec at Caer Survio to finally bring an end to the grievous Four Score War. Presumably due to its failure to protect Reman III, the Dragonguard was officially disbanded. Since the Reman line was now broken, the Amulet of Kings was buried with Reman III at Sancre Tor and would be lost for many generations. At Versidue's public inauguration, he pronounced that with the fall of the Reman Dynasty a new era would begin, thus entering the first year of the &lt;a href=\"Second%20Era\"&gt;Second Era&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe Akaviri Potentate (1E 2920\u20132E 430).\nSince the inception of the Second Empire, each emperor was advised by an Akaviri member of the Elder Council, bearing the title of Potentate. The Potentate aided the ruling emperor in all matters regarding the Empire. Being the chief advisers to the Reman Emperors, control of the Empire reverted into the hands of the Potentate after the end of the Reman Dynasty. While not true emperors, the Potentates' regency gave them the same authority as the Cyrodiils before them. The period of rule under the Akaviri shares the name of the \"Akaviri Potentate.\" Many viewed the suspicious ascendancy of the Akaviri Potentates as a patent act of subversion intended to bring a long delayed victory for the long-lived Akaviri invaders of &lt;a href=\"1E%202703\"&gt;1E 2703&lt;/a&gt;. For many, with the Cyrodiil line dead, the Amulet of Kings lost, and a new era beginning, their reign portended to the end of the world.\nVersidue-Shaie (1E 2920\u20132E 324).\nPotentate Versidue-Shaie was a trusted adviser and the acting successor of Reman III. His reign officially begins with the first year of the &lt;a href=\"Second%20Era\"&gt;Second Era&lt;/a&gt;. He was believed to be the son of the Tsaesci warlord who led the invasion that Reman I defeated in 1E 2703. A notable action of Versidue was the unofficial re-institution of the disbanded Dragonguard, now acting more so as a secret intelligence agency than the honor guard the Reman line was accustomed to. Versidue-Shaie would also construct the most notorious prison of Black Marsh,\"The Rose,\" within the ruins of the city of &lt;a href=\"Blackrose\"&gt;Blackrose&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe Tsaesci's inherent immortality allowed Versidue to rule over the Second Empire for many years. However, by the year &lt;a href=\"2E%20283\"&gt;2E 283&lt;/a&gt;, Versidue-Shaie was faced with an Empire on the verge of falling apart. Tamriel's vassal kingdoms had grown tired of complying with the Potentate's excessive demands. Many lords began openly rebelling against Versidue's levies, with some even taking up arms against Imperial garrisons. After an especially crippling loss at the Imperial fortress of Dawnstar, Versidue-Shaie called to order the &lt;a href=\"Council%20of%20Bardmont\"&gt;Council of Bardmont&lt;/a&gt; where he declared universal martial law, demanding the lords of Tamriel to disband their armies or face his wrath. Over the next thirty-seven years, Versidue-Shaie waged a bloody campaign to crush the armies of Tamriel's royal families. After sacrificing many legions, and nearly bankrupting the Empire, Potentate managed to secure the future of the Empire under the military might of his armies alone. With Versidue's forceful subjugation of Tamriel's disobedient rulers, the Empire faced another great challenge. Both Versidue and his rebellious vassals invested their entire treasuries into the conflict. By the war's end, the entirety of Tamriel was impoverished, farmers and merchants saw their livelihoods ruined, and the Potentate's subjects were incapable of paying their taxes. With the land now devoid of local guards and militias, crime escalated severely, a crisis Versidue's centralized legions could not effectively attend to. In order to accommodate for this issue, Dinieras-Ves \"the Iron,\" in &lt;a href=\"2E%20320\"&gt;2E 320&lt;/a&gt;, proposed the creation of a mercenary organization that nobles could hire to stand in for their own personal armies. The \"Syffim,\" as they were called, gave the aristocracy the ability to uphold the law in their realms while also supplying the Empire with a steady flow of capital, thus easing two of the Potentate's dilemmas. While originally composed of only Tsaesci, the Syffim eventually became comprised of citizens throughout Tamriel to meet the demands of local geography and politics, as well as make up for the lacking Tsaesci population. There was also a general air of suspicion surrounding the all-Akaviri Syffim, with many fearing it was the Potentate's attempt to secure complete Tsaesci dominance over Tamriel. The Syffim made swift progress against the criminal underworlds of Tamriel, quickly becoming a guild spanning the entire Empire.\nThe success of the Syffim inspired Potentate Versidue-Shaie to approve of the &lt;a href=\"Guilds%20Act\"&gt;Guilds Act&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"2E%20321\"&gt;2E 321&lt;/a&gt;, thus officially sanctioning many of Tamriel's various guilds, including the long distrusted &lt;a href=\"Mages%20Guild\"&gt;Mages Guild&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"Summerset%20Isles\"&gt;Summerset&lt;/a&gt;. The Syffim was also re-sanctioned, however it was from then on known as the &lt;a href=\"Fighters%20Guild\"&gt;Fighters Guild&lt;/a&gt;. Every guild recognized through this act would be protected by the Empire and allowed to expand their influence through payment. The Guilds Act was accepted in every province and would establish a standardize regulation of trade throughout Tamriel. The Empire was strengthened by its creation and the Imperial coffers were once more filled.\nWhile the Potentate Versidue-Shaie had successfully managed to stabilize the crumbling Second Empire, he would not continue his reign much longer. In the year &lt;a href=\"2E%20324\"&gt;2E 324&lt;/a&gt;, he was said to be murdered by the &lt;a href=\"Morag%20Tong\"&gt;Morag Tong&lt;/a&gt; within his palace in the &lt;a href=\"Elsweyr\"&gt;Elsweyr&lt;/a&gt; kingdom of &lt;a href=\"Senchal\"&gt;Senchal&lt;/a&gt;. The barbaric assassins, in their hubris, reportedly painted \"MORAG TONG\" on the walls of the palace in the Potentate's own blood. With this action, the Morag Tong was immediately outlawed across Tamriel, and the cult's eradication became the highest priority of every sovereign state within the Empire. Upon his death, Versidue Shaie would be succeeded by his son, &lt;a href=\"Savirien-Chorak\"&gt;Savirien-Chorak&lt;/a&gt;.\nSavirien-Chorak (2E 324\u20132E 430).\nThe Potentate Savirien-Chorak was not the able administrator his father was, and often responded poorly to the crises of his reign that began to tear the Empire apart. Shortly after Versidue's death, Savirien allowed the aristocracy to reform their personal armies, nullifying his father's bloody crusade to centralize Imperial authority.\nUnder Savirien-Chorak, the lands of &lt;a href=\"Orsinium\"&gt;Orsinium&lt;/a&gt; were recognized as a legitimate Imperial Province, with the Potentate believing it was better to have the &lt;a href=\"Orsimer\"&gt;Orcs&lt;/a&gt; as friends rather than enemies. However, this act would come to an end once Savirien, like his father before him, was murdered by the Morag Tong in &lt;a href=\"2E%20430\"&gt;2E 430&lt;/a&gt;, alongside all of his heirs. With no capable successor to the Potentate, the Second Empire crumbled within a fortnight, bringing about the chaotic period of misrule and insurrection known as the &lt;a href=\"Interregnum\"&gt;Interregnum&lt;/a&gt;.\nMilitary.\nImpressed by their battle prowess and weaponry, Reman Cyrodiil gladly allowed the defeated Akaviri to join his army. These Akaviri would reshape the army into the newfound &lt;a href=\"Imperial%20Legion\"&gt;Imperial Legion&lt;/a&gt; and form the backbone of the Legion. This new military force would be considered the most disciplined and effective in its time, easily conquering new territories. Reman used this new army to pacify Skyrim's and High Rock's wild populace and introduce them to the concept of an economy. Reman would then use this army to invade &lt;a href=\"Valenwood\"&gt;Valenwood&lt;/a&gt; and add it to his empire.\nThe Legions would meet their first disastrous defeats during their conquests of &lt;a href=\"Black%20Marsh\"&gt;Black Marsh&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Morrowind\"&gt;Morrowind&lt;/a&gt;. They were unequipped and unprepared for the swampy marshes and the Argonian armies. While the Legion did conquer the province, they did so under great losses. The Dunmer armies, however, successfully repelled every invasion attempt that was launched, causing the Empire to weaken.\nPretender states.\nDuring the &lt;a href=\"Interregnum\"&gt;Interregnum&lt;/a&gt; period, following the fall of the Second Empire, several ambitious factions aspired to claim the legacy of the Cyrodilic Dynasty. A seemingly endless cycle of pretender states and warlords vied for the Imperial Throne, all claiming themselves the rightful heirs to the Remans. The majority of these claimants would never sit the throne long enough to leave any notable mark on history. Throughout the course of the Interregnum, the cultural regions of Nibenay and Colovia would be split, with portions of their lands united only during very brief periods of rule. While the pretenders may have fancied themselves as emperor, they could never be the true consecrated heirs to the Cyrodilic Empire. As tradition holds, only those who bore the &lt;a href=\"Amulet%20of%20Kings\"&gt;Amulet of Kings&lt;/a&gt; and possessed the &lt;a href=\"Dragonborn%20%28Lore%29\"&gt;Dragonblood&lt;/a&gt; could light the &lt;a href=\"Dragonfires\"&gt;Dragonfires&lt;/a&gt; and therefore be deemed the righteous heir of &lt;a href=\"Alessia\"&gt;Alessia&lt;/a&gt; and the Empire. It was not until the rise of &lt;a href=\"Tiber%20Septim\"&gt;Tiber Septim&lt;/a&gt; in the late Second Era, that the Empire of the Cyrodiils would finally find its worthy successor.\nThe Sixth Century Empire.\nOne of the most famous pretender states established in the name of the Cyrodilic Empire was formed sometime in the early sixth century of the Second Era, by the &lt;a href=\"Reachman\"&gt;Reachman&lt;/a&gt; king, &lt;a href=\"Durcorach%20the%20Black%20Drake\"&gt;Durcorach the Black Drake&lt;/a&gt;. Durcorach's savage horde conquered large swathes of Colovia and Nibenay, and once upon the Imperial Throne, he curiously proclaimed himself the emperor of Cyrodiil, hoping to secure his title by marrying &lt;a href=\"Veraxia%20Tharn\"&gt;Veraxia Tharn&lt;/a&gt;. While he would eventually perish in an attempted conquest of &lt;a href=\"High%20Rock\"&gt;High Rock&lt;/a&gt; in the year &lt;a href=\"2E%20541\"&gt;2E 541&lt;/a&gt;, Durcorach managed to hold onto power longer than any of the would-be Emperors before him, managing to establish a short-lived dynasty, later referred to as the &lt;a href=\"Longhouse%20Emperors\"&gt;Longhouse Emperors&lt;/a&gt;. The Reachmen rulers were considered by most to be no more than foreign brutes with no notable heritage, and thus were quite despised by the people of Cyrodiil. Durcorach would be succeeded by his son Moricar, who would be, in turn, succeeded by his own son &lt;a href=\"Leovic\"&gt;Leovic&lt;/a&gt;. However, circa &lt;a href=\"2E%20573\"&gt;2E 573&lt;/a&gt;, Leovic's blasphemous attempt to legalize &lt;a href=\"Daedra\"&gt;Daedra&lt;/a&gt; worship within Cyrodiil caused his once loyal vassal, Duke &lt;a href=\"Varen%20Aquilarios\"&gt;Varen Aquilarios&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"Chorrol\"&gt;Chorrol&lt;/a&gt;, to rise up in rebellion against the Reachmen Dynasty. While initially suffering many defeats, several strategic victories on Varen's part convinced the whole of the &lt;a href=\"Colovian%20Estates\"&gt;Colovian Estates&lt;/a&gt; to join his cause. Eventually enlisting the help of Chancellor &lt;a href=\"Abnur%20Tharn\"&gt;Abnur Tharn&lt;/a&gt;, Varen marched on the &lt;a href=\"Imperial%20City\"&gt;Imperial City&lt;/a&gt; and personally slew Leovic, immediately proclaiming himself emperor of Cyrodiil. The Longhouse Emperors, after ruling for around thirty years, were extinguished. Seeking to restore prosperity to Cyrodiil and a proper coronation, Varen Aquilarious sent a group of five noble warriors, including himself, to locate the Amulet of Kings. Varen was promised by the mage &lt;a href=\"Mannimarco\"&gt;Mannimarco&lt;/a&gt; (secretly in league with the Daedric Prince &lt;a href=\"Molag%20Bal\"&gt;Molag Bal&lt;/a&gt;) that the Amulet would allow him to light the Dragonfires and possibly bless him with the Dragonblood. However, in &lt;a href=\"2E%20579\"&gt;2E 579&lt;/a&gt; once the Amulet was acquired, Mannimarco's betrayal became evident as Varen's attempts at lighting the Dragonfires instead caused his disappearance and the cataclysmic event known as the &lt;a href=\"Soulburst\"&gt;Soulburst&lt;/a&gt;. After Varen's assumed death, his wife &lt;a href=\"Clivia%20Tharn\"&gt;Clivia Tharn&lt;/a&gt; assumed the Ruby Throne as Empress-Regent. While attempts were made by the &lt;a href=\"House%20Tharn\"&gt;Tharns&lt;/a&gt; to expand the Empire into High Rock and &lt;a href=\"Valenwood\"&gt;Valenwood&lt;/a&gt;, they would prove to be futile efforts. The Empire would fall sometime shortly after the year &lt;a href=\"2E%20582\"&gt;2E 582&lt;/a&gt;, likely due to the pressures of the &lt;a href=\"Three%20Banners%20War\"&gt;Three Banners War&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe Daggerfall Covenant.\nThe Daggerfall Covenant, was a loose confederacy of various &lt;a href=\"Breton\"&gt;Breton&lt;/a&gt; states in High Rock formed in the year &lt;a href=\"2E%20541\"&gt;2E 541&lt;/a&gt; during Durcorach's invasion. The Covenant would eventually expand in power after &lt;a href=\"King%20Ranser%27s%20War\"&gt;King Ranser's War&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"2E%20566\"&gt;2E 566&lt;/a&gt;, to include states within &lt;a href=\"Hammerfell\"&gt;Hammerfell&lt;/a&gt;. The Daggerfall Covenant was ruled most directly by the &lt;a href=\"High%20King%20Emeric%20%28Online%29\"&gt;High King Emeric&lt;/a&gt;, a known scholar and admirer of the Reman Dynasty and the Potentates, and so modeled itself after the Empire of the Remans. The leadership and people of the Daggerfall Covenant viewed themselves as the spiritual successor to the Reman Dynasty, and thus the true heirs to the Empire of Cyrodiil. The main goal of Emeric's rule was to uphold the glory and traditions of the Reman Empire, remaining true to their methods of trade, freedoms, and the worship of the &lt;a href=\"Eight%20Divines\"&gt;Eight Divines&lt;/a&gt;. High King Emeric had originally formed a treaty with Emperor Varen sometime before his disappearance. However, once Clivia took the Throne, it became the Covenant's main goal to depose her, due to her relations to the Reachmen, as well her Empire's upheaval of Imperial traditions and heretical mockery of the Eight Divines. High King Emeric's endgame was to conquer Cyrodiil and reestablish Imperial Authority under a new Tamriel wide Covenant. The Daggerfall Covenant, however, would fall apart before its ambitions be achieved.\nAttrebus' Empire.\nAttrebus was a warlord who, at some point prior to &lt;a href=\"2E%20812\"&gt;2E 812&lt;/a&gt;, aspired to possess the Imperial Throne. While his reign didn't last much longer than the other forgotten pretenders of the Interregnum, he is often remembered for his actions regarding the &lt;a href=\"Akavir\"&gt;Akavir&lt;/a&gt;i. Possibly blaming the Akaviri for the Empire's fall, Attrebus made it his main goal to remove the remaining Akaviri from the immediate lands of Cyrodiil. The majority of the Akaviri refugees escaping Attrebus' persecution fled pass the border to &lt;a href=\"Elsweyr\"&gt;Elsweyr&lt;/a&gt;, where they would establish the Kingdom of &lt;a href=\"Rimmen\"&gt;Rimmen&lt;/a&gt;. Attrebus' heirs would eventually be overthrown by the old &lt;a href=\"Kamal\"&gt;Kamal&lt;/a&gt; remnants of &lt;a href=\"Ada%27Soom%20Dir-Kamal\"&gt;Dir Kamal&lt;/a&gt;'s invasion, usurping control of his Empire. While the Akaviri or Rimmen attempted to help stabilize the Empire now under the control of the Kamal, their efforts were doomed to fail and the Empire quickly collapsed.\nThe Emperor Zero.\n&lt;a href=\"Cuhlecain\"&gt;Cuhlecain&lt;/a&gt;, later referred to as the \"Emperor Zero\" in reference towards his early role in the establishment of the &lt;a href=\"Third%20Empire\"&gt;Third Empire&lt;/a&gt;, was the Colovian King of &lt;a href=\"Falkreath\"&gt;Falkreath&lt;/a&gt; who reunited the &lt;a href=\"Colovian%20Estates\"&gt;Colovian Estates&lt;/a&gt; alongside his powerful general, Talos. The two would eventually go on to subjugate the East and take the &lt;a href=\"Imperial%20City\"&gt;Imperial City&lt;/a&gt; where Cuhlecain would subsequently proclaim himself the emperor of Cyrodiil. However, Cuhlecain was assassinated before his coronation, with all his power falling into the hands of Talos. Cuhlecain's claim to the throne was supported by a Tsaesci knight rumored to be a remnant of Reman's old Dragonguard. Some groups have been known to speculate possible relations between Cuhlecain and the old Reman Bloodline."}

Though alien to &lt;a href=\"Imperial\"&gt;Imperial&lt;/a&gt; culture, they established some of the great traditions of &lt;a href=\"Tamriel\"&gt;Tamriel&lt;/a&gt;, granting charters to organizations such as the &lt;a href=\"Fighters%20Guild\"&gt;Fighters Guild&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Mages%20Guild\"&gt;Mages Guild&lt;/a&gt;. Another sign of peace and prosperity occurred in the year &lt;a href=\"2E%20309\"&gt;2E 309&lt;/a&gt;, when &lt;a href=\"Elsweyr\"&gt;Elsweyr&lt;/a&gt; was created by the union of the two &lt;a href=\"Khajiit\"&gt;Khajiit&lt;/a&gt; tribelands, &lt;a href=\"Anequina\"&gt;Anequina&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Pellitine\"&gt;Pellitine&lt;/a&gt;. But outside of the &lt;a href=\"Empire\"&gt;Empire&lt;/a&gt;'s borders, many conflicting forces strive for the &lt;a href=\"Imperial\"&gt;Imperial&lt;/a&gt; throne, such as the &lt;a href=\"Daggerfall%20Covenant\"&gt;Daggerfall Covenant&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Aldmeri%20Dominion%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Aldmeri Dominion&lt;/a&gt;.\nWhen the last Potentate, &lt;a href=\"Savirien-Chorak\"&gt;Savirien-Chorak&lt;/a&gt;, was assassinated in &lt;a href=\"2E%20430\"&gt;2E 430&lt;/a&gt;, leaving no heirs, the great Empire was severely weakened and subsequently destroyed. &lt;a href=\"Black%20Marsh\"&gt;Black Marsh&lt;/a&gt; forcibly split from the lands of men, as the &lt;a href=\"Knahaten%20Flu\"&gt;Knahaten Flu&lt;/a&gt; made the land uninhabitable to all but the &lt;a href=\"Argonians\"&gt;Argonians&lt;/a&gt; themselves. &lt;a href=\"Akaviri\"&gt;Akaviri&lt;/a&gt; forces once again invaded &lt;a href=\"Tamriel\"&gt;Tamriel&lt;/a&gt;, only barely rebuffed after attacking &lt;a href=\"Morrowind\"&gt;Morrowind&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"2E%20572\"&gt;2E 572&lt;/a&gt;. War and rebellion continued to rage from one end of the continent to the other.\nThe first sign of reunification occurred in the west. The &lt;a href=\"Altmer\"&gt;Altmer&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"Summerset%20Isles\"&gt;Summerset&lt;/a&gt;, long concerned with their own wars with other island kingdoms, allied with &lt;a href=\"Valenwood\"&gt;Valenwood&lt;/a&gt; to form the &lt;a href=\"Second%20Aldmeri%20Dominion\"&gt;Second Aldmeri Dominion&lt;/a&gt;. Still greater, however, was the force that rose from the ancient seat of emperors, &lt;a href=\"Cyrodiil\"&gt;Cyrodiil&lt;/a&gt;. A great general, &lt;a href=\"Talos\"&gt;Talos&lt;/a&gt;, liegeless after his lord's assassination, began his career as the greatest conqueror in the history of the land. Better known by his Imperial name, &lt;a href=\"Tiber%20Septim\"&gt;Tiber Septim&lt;/a&gt;, his armies conquered all of Tamriel, creating the Empire that bears his name even today, and ushering in the &lt;a href=\"Third%20Era\"&gt;Third Era&lt;/a&gt;."}

It is comprised of three sections: The Truth at Red Mountain, The Armies Grow, and The Doom Drum.\nContents.\nThe Truth at &lt;a href=\"Red%20Mountain\"&gt;Red Mountain&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Heart%20of%20Lorkhan\"&gt;Heart&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"Shor\"&gt;Shor&lt;/a&gt; was in &lt;a href=\"Resdayn\"&gt;Resdayn&lt;/a&gt;, as &lt;a href=\"Dagoth%20Ur%20%28Character%29\"&gt;Dagoth-Ur&lt;/a&gt; had promised. As Shor's army approached the westernmost bank of the &lt;a href=\"Inner%20Sea\"&gt;Inner Sea&lt;/a&gt;, they stared across at Red Mountain, where the &lt;a href=\"Dwemer\"&gt;Dwemer&lt;/a&gt;i armies had gathered. News from the scouts reported that the &lt;a href=\"Chimer\"&gt;Chimer&lt;/a&gt;i forces had just left &lt;a href=\"Narsis\"&gt;Narsis&lt;/a&gt;, and that they were taking their time joining their cousins against the &lt;a href=\"Nords\"&gt;Nords&lt;/a&gt;. Dagoth-Ur said that the &lt;a href=\"Tribunal\"&gt;Tribunal&lt;/a&gt; had betrayed their King's trust, that they sent Dagoth-Ur to Lorkhan (for that is what they called Shor in Resdayn) so that the god might wreak vengeance on the Dwarves for their hubris; that &lt;a href=\"Nerevar\"&gt;Nerevar&lt;/a&gt;'s peace with the Dwemer would be the ruin of the &lt;a href=\"Veloth\"&gt;Veloth&lt;/a&gt;i way. This was the reason for the slow muster, Dagoth-Ur said.\nThe Armies Grow.\nAnd Lorkhan (for that is what they called Shor in Resdayn) said: \"I do not wreak vengeance on the Dwarves for the reasons that the Tribunal might believe I do. Nevertheless, it is true that they will die by my hand, and any whoever should side with them. This Nerevar is the son of &lt;a href=\"Boethiah\"&gt;Boethiah&lt;/a&gt;, one of the strongest &lt;a href=\"Padomaic\"&gt;Padomaic&lt;/a&gt;s. He is a hero to his people despite his Tribunal, and he shall muster enough that this battle will be harder going still. We will need more than what we have.\" And so Dagoth-Ur, who wanted the Dwarves as dead as the Tribunal did, went to &lt;a href=\"Kogoruhn\"&gt;Kogoran&lt;/a&gt; and summoned his House chap'thil, his &lt;a href=\"Nix-Hound\"&gt;nix-hounds&lt;/a&gt;, his wizards, archers, his stolen men of brass. And the Ash King, &lt;a href=\"Wulfharth\"&gt;Wulfharth&lt;/a&gt;, hoary &lt;a href=\"Ysmir\"&gt;Ysmir&lt;/a&gt;, went and made peace with the &lt;a href=\"Orsimer\"&gt;Orcs&lt;/a&gt; in spite of his Nordic blood, and they brought many warriors but no wizards at all. Many Nords could not bring themselves to ally with their traditional enemies, even in the face of Red Mountain. They were close to desertion. Then Wulfharth said: \"Don't you see where you really are? Don't you know who Shor really is? Don't you know what this war is?\" And they looked from the King to the God to the Devils and Orcs, and some knew, really knew, and they are the ones that stayed.\nThe Doom Drum.\nNerevar carried &lt;a href=\"Keening\"&gt;Keening&lt;/a&gt;, a dagger made of the sound of the shadow of the moons. His champions were &lt;a href=\"Dumac\"&gt;Dumac&lt;/a&gt; Dwarfking, who carried a hammer of divine mass, and &lt;a href=\"Alandro%20Sul\"&gt;Alandro Sul&lt;/a&gt;, who was the immortal son of &lt;a href=\"Azura\"&gt;Azura&lt;/a&gt; and wore the &lt;a href=\"Wraith%20Mail\"&gt;Wraith Mail&lt;/a&gt;. They met Lorkhan at the last &lt;a href=\"battle%20of%20Red%20Mountain\"&gt;battle of Red Mountain&lt;/a&gt;. Lorkhan had his Heart again, but he had long been from it, and he needed time. Wulfharth met Sul but could not strike him, and he fell from grievous wounds, but not before shouting Sul blind. Dagoth-Ur met Dumac and slew him, but not before Sunder struck his lord's Heart. Nerevar turned away from Lorkhan and struck down Dagoth-Ur in rage, but he took a mortal wound from Lorkhan in turn. But Nerevar feigned the death that was coming early and so struck Lorkhan with surprise on his side. The Heart had been made solid by &lt;a href=\"Sunder\"&gt;Sunder&lt;/a&gt;'s tuning blow and Keening could now cut it out. And it was cut out and Lorkhan was defeated and the whole ordeal was thought over."}

For I have heard them. They can both understand speech, and utter it, though they do so with a hissing lisp. I shall tell you how I know.\nAs is so often the case since I came to &lt;a href=\"Apocrypha\"&gt;Apocrypha&lt;/a&gt;, I was cowering behind a stack of books, hiding from the baleful attentions of a towering gill-man whose notice I had inadvertently caught. I listened to hear if I was still gibbering, but I couldn't hear it, which usually means I'm not. Then I heard something else.\nJust beyond my concealing tower of tomes was one of those endless halls lined with numberless urns, halls that I have assiduously avoided ever since I learned that each urn houses, in a broth of noisome fluid, a living concept-organ excised from its corpus. I do not like those urns.\nFrom the entrance to this hall of urns came the all-too-familiar squelching sound of a Seeker's footfalls. But then it stopped, and in its place I heard, for the first time, the sticky sound of a speaking Seeker.\n\u2014I know a thing, the Seeker lisped, as a frisson of horror danced down my spine.\n\u2014Is it a thing worth knowing? came the hollow, sourceless voice of the organ in the hithermost urn.\n\u2014You shall judge, Floater. I have learned why we have seen no mortal intruders, save for the demented wizard, in many turns of the Great Pages.\n\u2014You know nothing, said the organ.\n\u2014I know &lt;a href=\"Hermaeus%20Mora%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Old Antecedent&lt;/a&gt; has entered into an agreement with the mortals, a compact, as they say. Is that nothing? asked the Seeker.\n\u2014Next to nothing. The Golden Eye is always entering into pacts with mortals. Thus my woeful condition.\n\u2014Avoid self-pity, or I shall mock you. You do not like it when I mock you. Listen attentively.\n\u2014I listen.\n\u2014In truth, the Scryer enters into many pacts with mortals\u2014but never before has he made a pact with every mortal on Nirn.\n\u2014Bah. Unlikely.\n\u2014I state it! It is a thing that is known.\n\u2014How?\n\u2014I heard a discussion between &lt;a href=\"Scrivener%20Uu-Thorax\"&gt;Scrivener Uu-Thorax&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Eleventh%20Preceptor\"&gt;Eleventh Preceptor&lt;/a&gt;. They came into the Crepuscule, where I was quietly\u2026.\n\u2014Seeking?\n\u2014Yes. In fact. Now, listen: the Scrivener told the Preceptor that the Inevitable Knower had agreed to a &lt;a href=\"Coldharbour%20Compact\"&gt;pact&lt;/a&gt;, to cease all direct interposition in &lt;a href=\"Mundus\"&gt;Mundial&lt;/a&gt; affairs.\n\u2014Impossible. I scoff. Mock me as you will.\n\u2014So thought I, and likewise the Preceptor expressed skepticism, but then the Scrivener spoke a Word of Asseveration. Books scattered everywhere, ichor fountained from my ear-holes, and I knew what he said was a Known Thing.\n\u2014But why? To meddle with mortals and wrest from them their knowledge is the Ur-&lt;a href=\"Daedra%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Daedra&lt;/a&gt;'s favorite pastime.\n\u2014He seems to have been paid a great price, something he dearly desired, but I could not clearly hear what, due to the injury to my ear-holes.\n\u2014It is knowledge, of course. Some great secret. It is ever so.\n\u2014So I deem it as well. And it seems this compact binds in both directions, which is why the mortals come here no more, added the Seeker.\n\u2014Except for the mad mage. How came he here, and upon what ill errand? asked the urn-organ.\n\u2014I know not. But if we catch him, we will pull out his \u2026 what is that sound?\nI heard it too, and so I ran. For I knew that sound. It was gibbering."}

This other crown is in the ruins of &lt;a href=\"Lindai%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;Lindai&lt;/a&gt;, for which she gives them a key to and marks it on the map.\nLindai.\nAt this point, one can either get the other crown or steal the correct crown from Herminia's house on the second floor. If one goes after the second crown, head over to Lindai and go through the rooms in the ruin until a large area is reached. The crown is in a small &lt;a href=\"Containers%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;Ayleid cask&lt;/a&gt;. While there, grab the crown and the two &lt;a href=\"Varla%20Stone\"&gt;Varla Stone&lt;/a&gt;s and leave the ruin.\nIf one decides to give Umbacano the &lt;a href=\"Ayleid%20Crown%20of%20Lindai\"&gt;Crown of Lindai&lt;/a&gt;, he will comment that the markings on the crown are somewhat different to how his reference books describe it to be. Nevertheless, he will mistake it to be authentic. If one gives Umbacano the correct crown, he accepts it as authentic immediately and asks the Hero to escort him through the ruins of &lt;a href=\"Nenalata\"&gt;Nenalata&lt;/a&gt; in three days.\nNenalata.\nAfter waiting for three days, Umbacano appears at the ruins, along with &lt;a href=\"Claude%20Maric\"&gt;Claude Maric&lt;/a&gt;. The Hero must now escort them through the ruin.\nIt is recommended to tell him to wait, or ignore him, and then clear the area up to the point of the throne room before escorting him, as he may die easily. This may also be done during the three day waiting period. There are also multiple difficult enemies to defeat, such as &lt;a href=\"Lich%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;liches&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Skeleton%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;skeletons&lt;/a&gt;, and other undead to fight.\nUpon arriving at the bottom of the ruin, Umbacano opens a door to a large throne room. In here, he sits on the throne. The storyline then changes depending on which crown the Hero gave him earlier on:\nCrown of Nenalata.\nUmbacano will put on the crown and yell out in elven tongue, at which point the four dark welkynd stones lining the room will transform him into the King of Nenalata. He will then turn hostile. Sections of the wall around the room will slide down, and skeletons, or liches if one is level 18 or higher, will come out to aid Umbacano.\nHe wields a leveled staff, which will make him more difficult to defeat. The staircase one will have come down from will have lowered, making escape impossible in that direction. The only exit one will have is to run through the throne room and out of the rear before making the way out of the ruin.\nCrown of Lindai.\nUmbacano will put on the crown and yell out in elven tongue. At that point, the four dark welkynd stones will destroy the crown, killing Umbacano in the process.\nOnce this happens, skeletons or liches will appear out of the now-lowered sections of wall, and the stairs will lower. As a result, one will have to use the alternate way out of the ruin."}

He asked for my help in opening the sealed inner chamber.\"\nWalkthrough.\nIn the &lt;a href=\"Lost%20City%20of%20the%20Na-Totambu\"&gt;Lost City of the Na-Totambu&lt;/a&gt;, you will find a man named &lt;a href=\"Paldeen\"&gt;Paldeen&lt;/a&gt;. He will tell you that he is a scholar of &lt;a href=\"Redguards%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Redguard&lt;/a&gt; history, and that a band of &lt;a href=\"Khajiit%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Khakiit&lt;/a&gt; have kidnapped him so they can force him to decipher ancient runes on the relics they are looting here. He will tell you though that he thinks there is something very valuable in these ruins, and will ask you to help him get to it.\nHead out of Paldeen's cell and through the hallway to the north. There, Paldeen will ask you to look for an inscribed Yokudan tablet with details on how to move further. You will find this inscription on the statue nearby; Paldeen will ask you to come speak to him once he is done deciphering it. He will mention that according to this inscription, the \"Eyes of Yokuda\" are here in these ruins. These Eyes act as keys to the vault, where something called the Cartulary of Tamed Dunes is located. The eyes are in three areas: \"The Gauntlet,\" \"The Lair,\" and \"The Ruin.\"\nThe Third Eye of Yokuda will be down the passageway to your east. You will find yourself in a room with a number of large statues; the Eye is in the east of the room, guarded by two deceptively powerful skeletons. These skeletons will respawn the moment you take the eye, so be prepared to face them twice. Once you have the eye, head along the pathway to the north to find the Right Eye of Yokuda. This one is not nearly as well-guarded; fight your way through the gargoyles here and take it. Once you have it, take the passage back to the main room; be sure to pick up the skyshard along the way. In the main room, you will see a path of fire traps and spike traps; follow these traps, but take care not to get hurt. You will find the Left Eye of Yokuda on the other side. \nNow that you have all three of the eyes, bring them to the door to the archive, in the north of the central room. Place the eyes in the pedestals there and the door will open. Head inside and head through the hallway. Once you reach the room on the other side, you will find a ghost of a &lt;a href=\"Yokudan%20King\"&gt;Yokudan King&lt;/a&gt; there. When you tell him you are here for the Cartulary, he will tell you to take one of three tests to prove that you are worthy. If you chose the Trial of Combat, a wave of enemies will spawn around the room; you will have to defeat these. If you chose the Trial of Kingship, . If you chose the Trial of Bloodlines, .\nOnce you have completed your trial, you can take the Cartulary from the chest behind where the ghost was.

They prostrate themselves before me and kiss my weathered soles, begging for a glimpse of &lt;a href=\"ja-Kha%27jay\"&gt;ja-Kha'jay&lt;/a&gt;. I sit then upon my upraised throne, draped in the plaited burdens of countless chiefs, and sigh. For the epiphany of &lt;a href=\"Riddle%27Thar\"&gt;Riddle'Thar&lt;/a&gt; rests not within the &lt;a href=\"Mane\"&gt;Mane&lt;/a&gt;-made-mighty\u2014not even in the sacred halls of the &lt;a href=\"Temple%20of%20Two-Moons%20Dance\"&gt;Temple of Two-Moons Dance&lt;/a&gt;. The truth of Riddle'Thar lies in the heart of true Khajiit. In the claws, the whiskers, and the &lt;a href=\"soul\"&gt;soul&lt;/a&gt;. Think now on &lt;a href=\"Jone\"&gt;Jone&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Jode\"&gt;Jode&lt;/a&gt;. Think now on their wax and wane. Khajiit do not deliberate in the womb. We do not struggle for form and purpose. &lt;a href=\"Two-Moons%20Dance\"&gt;The Dance&lt;/a&gt; decides. And in that fated moment of birth, we learn what our soul already knows. We fall into the cadence and the step. The Moons' virtues and obligations are inherent, just as our &lt;a href=\"Khajiit%23Moons%20and%20the%20Khajiit%20breeds\"&gt;furstock&lt;/a&gt; is inherent. The truth of Riddle'Thar grows like &lt;a href=\"Moon%20Sugar\"&gt;sugarcane&lt;/a&gt; in the soul\u2014sweet, vibrant, and eager for the harvesting. We do not make the cane grow. We do not coax it into fullness. It does that of its own accord. You need only take up the scythe in the proper season and reap its ample blessings.\nThe pursuit of Riddle'Thar's mysteries is also the pursuit of joy. Of fulfillment. I speak now the truth that, in your heart, you already know. Embrace that wisdom, pay heed to the dictates of the soul, make way for the peace and order Riddle'Thar provides, and you shall find joy in abundance.\nFirst, a true cat must be curious. How often the furless outsiders fall prey to deception and mirage! &lt;a href=\"Lorkhaj\"&gt;Lorkhaj&lt;/a&gt;'s inventions do not lurk at the corners of our sight. They lounge in plain view\u2014so common and unassuming that we accept them as truth with a kitten's simplicity. One must always listen longer and gaze deeper. Do not yield at your first thought. Inquire. Lift stones both great and small. For gifts of persistence are many indeed.\nNext, a true cat must be clever. Providence granted us the gifts of swift claws, fleet paws, and graceful strength. But the dangers that prowl upon &lt;a href=\"Nirni\"&gt;Nirni&lt;/a&gt;'s back too often withstand the well-timed strike. When trapped in life's cruel maze, you must resist the call to simple solutions. Do not resort to artless scheming. For every trouble there are countless strategies\u2014and the greatest of those strategies rest within the mind. Fight without fighting. Speak without speaking. Yield without yielding. Do this, and you shall find that the greatest joys are those that hide on the far side of a jest.\nThird, a true cat must treat themselves with kindness. Too often, leaders of the book and stole preach charity at one's own expense. Theirs is a wheezing virtue, hidden beneath a mournful shroud. How many coins can a starved almsgiver carry? Too few. I tell you, the fruit of charity grows from joyful, vigorous branches. If all give and none take, how wretched our kingdoms would become! Take the rest your labors earn. Taste the sugar that falls from above. Drink the wine that flows from Nirni's great bounty. For in walking pleasure's road, we blaze a trail for the downtrodden to follow.\nNext, a true cat must be pious. The Two-Moons Dance offers a path to ja-Khaj'ay, but without &lt;a href=\"Llesw%27er\"&gt;Llesw'er&lt;/a&gt;'s guides, even the cleverest Khajiit can drift toward the Dark. Mighty &lt;a href=\"Alkosh\"&gt;Alkosh&lt;/a&gt;, Blessed &lt;a href=\"Khenarthi\"&gt;Khenarthi&lt;/a&gt;, Noble &lt;a href=\"S%27rendarr\"&gt;S'rendarr&lt;/a&gt;, Loving &lt;a href=\"Mara\"&gt;Mara&lt;/a&gt;, Clever &lt;a href=\"Baan%20Dar\"&gt;Baan Dar&lt;/a&gt;, and most importantly, Jone and Jode reign beyond the stars, alight with kindness, wisdom, and virtuous cunning. The enlightenment of Riddle'Thar is a lens of clarity through which true cats can now view these divine ancestors. Heed their counsel, observe their laws, and by the grace of Riddle'Thar, you shall never fall prey to the snares of &lt;a href=\"Namiira\"&gt;Namiira&lt;/a&gt;.\nFinally, a true cat must be wary. Of all the races who dwell upon Nirni's back, we Khajiit risk the most. Our history dwarfs that of &lt;a href=\"men\"&gt;men&lt;/a&gt;. We sowed our crops here before the coming of the &lt;a href=\"Elves\"&gt;Elves&lt;/a&gt;. Our souls stretch back beyond the counting of the years and the certainty of each sun's rising. That makes us both wise and dangerous. The hateful eyes of Lorkhaj stay fixed upon us always. Namiira's darkness swirls amid our dreams and doubts. All the evils of &lt;a href=\"Oblivion%20%28Realm%29\"&gt;Oblivion&lt;/a&gt; rake their claws and gnash their fangs against the Lattice, seeking to take our old souls as a prize. Be cautious. Move swiftly. Hide your hearts away in the thick jungles of the self and think often of their great worth. For if you fail to hear the beating of your own heart, the beat of Lorkhaj's will take its place forevermore.\nRiddle'Thar is all of these virtues, Moon-child. The great well of Khajiiti spirit from which we all drink. Know that its truth dances beyond just the Mane, beyond the Temples, beyond the plains and jungles of our beloved homeland. Look to the Moons. When Jone and Jode dance above, your soul dances with them."}

Duramac, on the other hand, was a genius engineer, but lacked the artistic vision to allow his inventions to reach their potential.\nIt's only when they joined forces to create Nchuanthumz that they built something truly profound. If I am to find their creation, I must grasp history itself by the tail.\nSkyrim Expedition - Day 17\nOur travels have brought us to this bleak, underground tunnel, which the natives call &lt;a href=\"Frostroot%20Cave\"&gt;Frostroot Cave&lt;/a&gt;. Its winding cords of ice and rock make it truly a miserable place. My scales feel chilly, but more so my nerves.\nLuckily, we've hired a few soldiers of fortune into our employ. Some would call them &lt;a href=\"Bandits%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;bandits&lt;/a&gt;, but I like to refer to them as mercenaries with a discount!

Having committed a small number of \"unapproved\" criminal acts in the &lt;a href=\"Iliac%20Bay\"&gt;Iliac Bay&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"The%20Agent\"&gt;Agent&lt;/a&gt; is offered the chance to join the Thieves Guild, if they can steal a small object of clothing.\nBackground.\nHaving committed a number of petty crimes, either through &lt;a href=\"pickpocket\"&gt;pickpocket&lt;/a&gt;ing or picking the locks on doors, the Agent receives an anonymous note inviting them to join the Thieves Guild.\nWalkthrough.\nAfter a small period of time living in the &lt;a href=\"Iliac%20Bay\"&gt;Iliac Bay&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"the%20Agent\"&gt;the Agent&lt;/a&gt; may turn their hand to petty crime, either through breaking locks or pickpocketing the various inhabitants of the Bay. After successfully pickpocketing ten victims, or smashing through a random number of locked doors, the Agent will receive a letter, delivered by a one-eyed beggar. This letter will reveal that the &lt;a href=\"Thieves%20Guild%20%28Daggerfall%29\"&gt;Thieves Guild&lt;/a&gt; have seen the Agent \"in the act,\" and demand that they either \"join the guild or fact the consequences.\"\nGuild Guidance.\nThe letter will offer the Agent a simple task to complete should they wish to join the Guild. This task requires that a specific piece of &lt;a href=\"Clothing%20%28Daggerfall%29\"&gt;clothing&lt;/a&gt; must be stolen from a building in a town in the same &lt;a href=\"Regions%20%28Daggerfall%29\"&gt;region&lt;/a&gt; as that which the letter was delivered. Beyond that, the letter reveals nothing other than the time limit.\nWith that the Agent must head to the town mentioned, find the building and enter, potentially having to lock-pick or smash through the door. Inside, the Agent will find the piece of cloth hidden in a pile of loot somewhere within, and will receive a notification informing them of a note that fell out of the clothing, which reveals the location of the Thieves Guild contact. However, the Agent may first have to deal with the owner of the item, who will randomly spawn at some point after the Agent has entered the house, exclaiming:\n\"Thief! I'll teach you to steal from a wizard. It will be a lesson you won't soon forget!\"\nThe Agent must hence escape the building and head to the town specified in the note, regardless of whether they slay the owner or not. Once there, the Agent must find the contact and speak with them before the time limit expires to complete the quest and join the Guild.\nRewards.\nThe contact from the Guild will officially welcome the Agent to the Thieves Guild, who will also hand them a random &lt;a href=\"Map%20%28Daggerfall%29\"&gt;dungeon map&lt;/a&gt; for successfully completing the quest. The contact also states that the Agent should be given \"a gold piece\" for the \"worthless piece of trash\" that they stole, although this is not handed over in exchange for the cloth. Furthermore, there are no &lt;a href=\"Reputation%20%28Daggerfall%29\"&gt;reputation&lt;/a&gt; changes should the Agent successfully complete the quest.\nIn contrast, should the Agent fail the quest, either by ignoring the original letter or failing to speak with the contact before the time limit expires, they will receive the following changes to reputation:"}

Pacrooti will keep trying until he wins it back. That will teach them.\n- &lt;a href=\"Pacrooti\"&gt;Pacrooti&lt;/a&gt;\nPacrooti is back in the city and has spent many hours combing the tangles out of his fur. Later, he played dice with a young Breton and won an entire set of armor. He thinks he will sell it, as it would be too expensive to have a tail hole added.\n- Pacrooti\nPacrooti cannot reason with these Bosmer. He found a tree that was brown with yellow leaves, and still they hoot and holler when he tries to cut it down. Why do they call it \"The &lt;a href=\"Green%20Pact\"&gt;Green Pact&lt;/a&gt;\" if it pertains to trees of all colors? Elves are crazy. Or maybe just color-blind.\n- Pacrooti\nDear friend, you would tell Pacrooti if you thought he was being facetious, would you not? The local innkeeper tells Pacrooti that Pacrooti is not to be trusted, but can't give a good reason why. All Pacrooti has done is sleep in his room and take objects left in the open. He has never once told a lie or attempted an immoral act.\n- Pacrooti\nOne day, Pacrooti will discover the secret to crossing a river without getting wet. But it is not this day. Pacrooti even paid the ferryman double fare for a smoother ride! The ferryman failed. Pacrooti hopes you enjoy your components. They, fortunately, were in a pack, and therefore, dry. Not so for Pacrooti.\n- Pacrooti"}

He will tell you that Agganor convinced the chief to join the Scaled Court, and that when Lashburr spoke out against the plan, he was banished.\nThe first step in the revenge plan is to march into the Valley of Scars and burn all of the Scaled Court's standards. There are three standards in total. The southern standard is to your left when you enter the valley. The northern standard is directly to your north from there, and the western standard is on the west side of the camp. Once all of them have been torced, it is time to go after Agganor himself. He is in the &lt;a href=\"Exarch%27s%20Stronghold\"&gt;Exarch's Stronghold&lt;/a&gt;; jump down from the bridge to reach his location, and make sure to grab the &lt;a href=\"skyshard\"&gt;skyshard&lt;/a&gt; there if you have not already. \nEither way, slay Agganor and take his helmet. Head back outside and mount this helmet on a pike for all the Iron Orcs to see. You can find an appropriate pike in the south of the valley, atop the hill just outside the valley entrance. With that done, return to Lashburr to finish the quest. "}

It is the final resting place of the &lt;a href=\"Warlord%20Gathrik\"&gt;Warlord Gathrik&lt;/a&gt;. One word of the &lt;a href=\"Become%20Ethereal\"&gt;Become Ethereal&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"shout\"&gt;shout&lt;/a&gt; can be found here.\nOverview.\nIronbind Barrow is a medium-sized dungeon. It is occupied by &lt;a href=\"Draugr%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;draugr&lt;/a&gt;, and has a named final boss, Warlord Gathrik.\nThe barrow is located about an equal distance southeast of &lt;a href=\"Dawnstar%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Dawnstar&lt;/a&gt; and southwest of &lt;a href=\"Winterhold%20%28Skyrim%20City%29\"&gt;Winterhold&lt;/a&gt; on the road from &lt;a href=\"Whiterun%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Whiterun&lt;/a&gt; to &lt;a href=\"Windhelm%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Windhelm&lt;/a&gt;, a short distance north-northwest of the &lt;a href=\"Nightgate%20Inn\"&gt;Nightgate Inn&lt;/a&gt; near the &lt;a href=\"Wayward%20Pass\"&gt;Wayward Pass&lt;/a&gt; across the northern mountain chain.\nWalkthrough.\nBefore entering, the &lt;a href=\"Last%20Dragonborn\"&gt;Dragonborn&lt;/a&gt; will come upon a warrior, &lt;a href=\"Salma%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Salma&lt;/a&gt;, and a wizard, &lt;a href=\"Beem-Ja\"&gt;Beem-Ja&lt;/a&gt;, two adventurers arguing over exploring the ruins. Salma is eager, yet Beem-Ja believes they should wait. However, upon the Dragonborn's arrival, the two agree to delve inside, so long as the Dragonborn accompanies them.\nUpon entering, the Dragonborn will be in a frozen cave with a few &lt;a href=\"Frostbite%20Spider%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Frostbite Spiders&lt;/a&gt; and a &lt;a href=\"giant%20frostbite%20spider\"&gt;giant frostbite spider&lt;/a&gt;. Note that Salma and Beem-Ja will wait for the Dragonborn if they get too far ahead.\nPast the cave is the actual Nordic Ruin. To the right of the first gate is a treasure chest with leveled loot. A handle that opens the gate is in an alcove to the left side of the gate, opposite the chest.\nThrough the gate is a room with a pit covered by a metal grate. Two draugr come out of their crypts to attack. There is a table against the north wall that contains various potions and armor. From the east wall is a passage that bends into a left turn and eventually heads west. A table with a leveled weapon is on the right (north) side of the passage. Where the passage turns right (north), a chest has minor loot, but is protected by a spear trap.\nThe passage turns north and enters a room with a bridge and several draugr. On the other side of the bridge is a small room with an adept-locked chest at the south end that contains minor loot. Just before the room, at the end of the bridge, a ramp goes down to the right (south). At the south end of the room is a gate that leads to a passage to another room with a large fire pit in the center and two draugr. There are miscellaneous potions available on shelves around the room, and a pull chain that opens the grate above that covered the pit from the earlier room.\nThrough the iron gate to the east is a room with a gate at the opposite end, and high-grade loot on a pedestal. Take the loot from a small distance, as spikes shoot from the floor amid ceiling around the pedestal. This will also raise the gate in front. There is also a pull-chain above and behind the pedestal (opposite from the gate) that will raise it as well.\nThrough that gate, the passage turns north to an iron door. The final chamber is a great throne room, in which &lt;a href=\"Warlord%20Gathrik\"&gt;Warlord Gathrik&lt;/a&gt; will arise and attack, accompanied by a few &lt;a href=\"Skeleton%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;skeletons&lt;/a&gt;, both mage and archer versions. Due to the Warlord's frequent &lt;a href=\"Ice%20Spike%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Ice Spike&lt;/a&gt; attacks, melee is not recommended unless the Dragonborn can back him into a corner. After slaying Gathrik, Beem-Ja (if still alive) will then explain that he needs a blood sacrifice to absorb Gathrik's power, and that the Dragonborn will be just the one. He will then attack with &lt;a href=\"Lightning%20Bolt%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Lightning Bolt&lt;/a&gt; spells. Upon slaying him, Salma will be disheartened, and asks the Dragonborn to continue without her.\nAfter collecting the Word of Power and loot from a chest left of the &lt;a href=\"Word%20Walls%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;word wall&lt;/a&gt;, the Dragonborn will find a gate with a pull chain on the lower level of the throne room to the right. This leads to a stairway, at the top of which is an exit to Ironbind Overlook. To the left (southeast) from the doorway is a chest with minor loot. From here, it is possible to fast travel."}

It is traditionally located in the province of &lt;a href=\"High%20Rock\"&gt;High Rock&lt;/a&gt;, though some categorizations put it as a neutral territory between High Rock and &lt;a href=\"Hammerfell\"&gt;Hammerfell&lt;/a&gt;. Balfiera is the home of the &lt;a href=\"Direnni%20Hegemony\"&gt;Direnni Hegemony&lt;/a&gt;, an ancient &lt;a href=\"High%20Elven\"&gt;High Elven&lt;/a&gt; family that is known for their influence over the history of High Rock, as well as their expertise in mercantilism.\nDescription.\nGeography.\nThe Isle of Balfiera is part of an unnamed archipelago in the Iliac Bay; it is unknown if it is synonymous with an existing chain such as the &lt;a href=\"Dellese%20Isles\"&gt;Dellese Isles&lt;/a&gt; or an entirely different group altogether. The main island is sometimes referred to as just Balfiera, while the smaller islands going northwest are considered a part of the Balfiera region. The Isle of Balfiera is a large island with a slope going up towards the center, where the &lt;a href=\"Direnni%20Tower\"&gt;Direnni Tower&lt;/a&gt; is located. Throughout the area, are ancient ruins such as &lt;a href=\"the%20Masoleum%20of%20Darkivaron\"&gt;the Masoleum of Darkivaron&lt;/a&gt; and settlements such as &lt;a href=\"Upvale\"&gt;Upvale&lt;/a&gt;, which is the largest settlement in the Balfiera region. The islands continue northwest, eventually entering the &lt;a href=\"County%20of%20Bhoriane\"&gt;County of Bhoriane&lt;/a&gt;. The Isle of Balfiera is also the center of the &lt;a href=\"Direnni%20Hegemony\"&gt;Direnni Hegemony&lt;/a&gt;, which had originally conquered all of High Rock, from &lt;a href=\"Daggerfall\"&gt;Daggerfall&lt;/a&gt; to the &lt;a href=\"Markarth\"&gt;Markarth&lt;/a&gt;.\nHistory.\n&lt;a href=\"Merethic%20Era\"&gt;Merethic Era&lt;/a&gt;.\nOrigins of the Adamantine Tower &amp; Lorkhan's Demise.\nBefore the provinces were even established and their modern-day races inhabited the land, the &lt;a href=\"Adamantine%20Tower\"&gt;Adamantine Tower&lt;/a&gt; stood within the center of the Island, some say that the tower was built in the &lt;a href=\"Dawn%20Era\"&gt;Dawn Era&lt;/a&gt;, while others claim that the Tower was built sometime in &lt;a href=\"ME%202500\"&gt;ME 2500&lt;/a&gt;, before the city-state of &lt;a href=\"Firsthold\"&gt;Firsthold&lt;/a&gt; (the first modern city) was built. While the tower's origins are unknown, its purpose was not, the &lt;a href=\"Aedra\"&gt;Aedra&lt;/a&gt; utilized the Adamantine Tower as a meeting ground, to discuss the fate of &lt;a href=\"Mundus\"&gt;Mundus&lt;/a&gt;. At the summit of the tower, &lt;a href=\"Auri-El\"&gt;Auri-El&lt;/a&gt; the Chief Deity of the &lt;a href=\"Aldmeri%20Pantheon\"&gt;Aldmeri Pantheon&lt;/a&gt; had slain &lt;a href=\"Lorkhan\"&gt;Lorkhan&lt;/a&gt;, the trickster God and flung his &lt;a href=\"Heart%20of%20Lorkhan\"&gt;heart&lt;/a&gt; across the continent, due to his creation of the mortal races, much to the dismay of the other Aedra. From then on, the Isle of Balfiera was left abandoned, as the races of Nirn had grown and prospered, eventually inhabiting Tamriel. The island would be left abandoned for many years.\n&lt;a href=\"First%20Era\"&gt;First Era&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe History of the Direnni in High Rock.\nSometime in the first era, the &lt;a href=\"High%20Elves\"&gt;High Elves&lt;/a&gt; of the &lt;a href=\"Direnni%20Clan\"&gt;Direnni Clan&lt;/a&gt; moved to the Isle of Balfiera. Long after &lt;a href=\"Asliel%20Direnni\"&gt;Asliel Direnni&lt;/a&gt; established himself in the &lt;a href=\"Isle%20of%20Summerset\"&gt;Isle of Summerset&lt;/a&gt; and growing from his humble village of &lt;a href=\"Tyrigel\"&gt;Tyrigel&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Cygnus%20Direnni\"&gt;Cygnus Direnni&lt;/a&gt; traveled northward to the Iliac Bay, where she discovered the Island and the Adamantine Tower, claiming it as her own. From then on, the Direnni abandoned their home of Summerset, moving into the Tower and living there ever since. By &lt;a href=\"1E%20355\"&gt;1E 355&lt;/a&gt;, the Elves of the &lt;a href=\"Direnni%20Hegemony\"&gt;Direnni Hegemony&lt;/a&gt; were able to take control over the entire province of High Rock, influencing the young race of the &lt;a href=\"Bretons\"&gt;Bretons&lt;/a&gt;. In conflicts such as the &lt;a href=\"Battle%20of%20Glenumbria%20Moors\"&gt;Battle of Glenumbria Moors&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"1E%20482\"&gt;1E 482&lt;/a&gt;, the Direnni were at the forefront of the battle, driving the &lt;a href=\"Alessian%20Order\"&gt;Alessian Order&lt;/a&gt; out of &lt;a href=\"Greater%20Bretony\"&gt;Greater Bretony&lt;/a&gt; and earlier when the Direnni Clan forced the &lt;a href=\"Nords\"&gt;Nords&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"Skyrim\"&gt;Skyrim&lt;/a&gt; out of the land, to which they took afterward. But eventually, with other threats gone, the Direnni lost Greater Bretony when the Bretons had revolted against them. Eventually, the Direnni Clan was forced back onto the Isle of Balfiera, where they remained, as the Breton province of High Rock expanded into modern-day. The Isle of Balfiera and the Direnni had begun to grow isolated.\nLaloriaran Dynar and his fall from Bisnensel.\nIn the aftermath of Battle of Glenumbria Moors, the Last King of the Ayleids, &lt;a href=\"Laloriaran%20Dynar\"&gt;Laloriaran Dynar&lt;/a&gt; had returned to his city-state of &lt;a href=\"Bisnensel\"&gt;Bisnensel&lt;/a&gt;. Sometime later, a cult known as the &lt;a href=\"Primeval%20Seekers\"&gt;Primeval Seekers&lt;/a&gt; was created in Bisnensel by &lt;a href=\"High%20Priest%20Uluscant\"&gt;High Priest Uluscant&lt;/a&gt;. The Seekers are adamant worshippers of &lt;a href=\"Hermaeus%20Mora\"&gt;Hermaeus Mora&lt;/a&gt;, and the cult had grown substantially large, bringing various other cultists from all over. At one point, Uluscant approached King Dynar with the intent of sharing rule over the city, which was much to the dismay of the King. And so Dynar denied him of the position, which the cult did not take lightly. As time went on, Laloriaran Dynar was overthrown by the cult, and so he and his family sought refuge at the Isle of Balfiera and with the Direnni Clan, serving them. Eventually, Laloriaran Dynar traveled for his original home of &lt;a href=\"Nenalata\"&gt;Nenalata&lt;/a&gt;, where he was never seen again, and Bisnensel had fallen into obscurity like the rest of the Ayleids. It is unknown what happened to his family.\n&lt;a href=\"Second%20Era\"&gt;Second Era&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe Unforeseen Queen &amp; her time on Balfiera.\nOn the &lt;a href=\"Evening%20Star\"&gt;Evening Star&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"2E%20563\"&gt;2E 563&lt;/a&gt;, the royal family of &lt;a href=\"Alinor\"&gt;Alinor&lt;/a&gt; gathered at the &lt;a href=\"Crystal%20Tower\"&gt;Crystal Tower&lt;/a&gt;, where they would celebrate &lt;a href=\"Princess%20Ayrenn\"&gt;Princess Ayrenn&lt;/a&gt;'s acceptance into the &lt;a href=\"College%20of%20Sapiarchs\"&gt;College of Sapiarchs&lt;/a&gt;. However, on that day, Ayrenn disappeared from the province, taking claim to her own destiny, beginning with traveling northward, to the Isle of Balfiera and the Direnni Clan. It was there, Ayrenn was taught the ways of warfare, starting from a novice in swordplay to a master in seasoned blade-dancing. Eventually, Ayrenn outgrew the teachings of the Direnni, and so left the island and traveling through all corners of the continent, out drinking &lt;a href=\"Mabjaarn%20Flame-Hair\"&gt;Mabjaarn Flame-Hair&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"High%20Queen\"&gt;High Queen&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"Eastern%20Skyrim\"&gt;Eastern Skyrim&lt;/a&gt;, dancing with the &lt;a href=\"Nereid\"&gt;Nereid&lt;/a&gt;s of the &lt;a href=\"Ilessan%20Hills\"&gt;Ilessan Hills&lt;/a&gt;, and stealing the &lt;a href=\"Indigo%20Scrolls\"&gt;Indigo Scrolls&lt;/a&gt; from the priests of &lt;a href=\"Necrom\"&gt;Necrom&lt;/a&gt;. This had lasted for several years, while her younger brother, &lt;a href=\"Prince%20Naemon\"&gt;Prince Naemon&lt;/a&gt; took to studying at the College. But when &lt;a href=\"King%20Hidellith\"&gt;King Hidellith&lt;/a&gt; had passed away, she returned to the Summerset Isles and claimed her birthright. She would go on to create the &lt;a href=\"First%20Aldmeri%20Dominion\"&gt;First Aldmeri Dominion&lt;/a&gt;, one of the strongest alliances ever.\n&lt;a href=\"Third%20Era\"&gt;Third Era&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe Affair of Lysandus &amp; Medora Direnni.\nBy &lt;a href=\"3E%20405\"&gt;3E 405&lt;/a&gt;, the Direnni Clan had continued to live in the Isle of Balfiera, through the Direnni Tower. Settlements were established within the hills such as &lt;a href=\"Upvale\"&gt;Upvale&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Gallomarket\"&gt;Gallomarket&lt;/a&gt;. One of the last of the Direnni Clan, &lt;a href=\"Medora\"&gt;Medora&lt;/a&gt;, still lived in Balfiera Tower. At the time, Medora served as the Court-Sorceress for the &lt;a href=\"Kingdom%20of%20Daggerfall\"&gt;Kingdom of Daggerfall&lt;/a&gt;, eventually becoming the lover of &lt;a href=\"King%20Lysandus\"&gt;King Lysandus&lt;/a&gt;, the leader of Daggerfall. However, when this came to light, &lt;a href=\"Queen%20Mynisera\"&gt;Queen Mynisera&lt;/a&gt; had banished Medora into the Direnni Tower, sealing her from the outside as the Direnni Tower devolved into a ruined castle. For a while, Lysandus had wanted to reunite with Medora and vice-versa. And so with the impending &lt;a href=\"War%20of%20Betony\"&gt;War of Betony&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"3E%20403\"&gt;3E 403&lt;/a&gt;, Lysandus had seen an opportunity to retire to Balfiera forever. It was ultimately decided that Lysandus would inherit his throne to his son, &lt;a href=\"Gothryd\"&gt;Gothryd&lt;/a&gt; and that an assassin would kill his double in the &lt;a href=\"Battle%20of%20Cryngaine%20Field\"&gt;Battle of Cryngaine Field&lt;/a&gt;. With everything moving accordingly, Lysandus left to meet with &lt;a href=\"Lord%20Woodborne\"&gt;Lord Woodborne&lt;/a&gt;, who had betrayed him, killing him, and sending his body to &lt;a href=\"Tamarilyn%20Point\"&gt;Tamarilyn Point&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Menevia\"&gt;Menevia&lt;/a&gt;. And so, Lysandus never saw Medora and the Direnni Mage remained stuck in the tower until fate would come justified.\nMedora's Freedom &amp; the Avenged Lysandus.\nIn 3E 405, &lt;a href=\"Uriel%20Septim%20VII\"&gt;Uriel Septim VII&lt;/a&gt; had sent an &lt;a href=\"Agent\"&gt;Agent&lt;/a&gt; to the Kingdom of Daggerfall with the intent of discovering the sudden appearance of King Lysandus' spirit in the Iliac Bay. Through deep sleuthing, the Agent was brought to the Isle of Balfiera, where they encountered Medora Direnni traveled with the tower. Medora had knowledge of breaking the barrier, and so she tasked the Agent with retrieving a &lt;a href=\"Great%20Unicorn%27s%20Horn\"&gt;Great Unicorn's Horn&lt;/a&gt; from the castle of &lt;a href=\"Shedungent\"&gt;Shedungent&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;a href=\"Wrothgarian%20Mountains\"&gt;Wrothgarian Mountains&lt;/a&gt;. Since &lt;a href=\"Nulfaga\"&gt;Nulfaga&lt;/a&gt;, Lysandus' mother was considered mad, she could not bring the horn to Medora, and so the Agent traveled themselves. With the horn, Medora escaped her prison in the tower and helped the Agent with their case on Lysandus' spirit. Sometime later, Medora had sent the Agent to the &lt;a href=\"Kingdom%20of%20Orsinium\"&gt;Kingdom of Orsinium&lt;/a&gt;, where they learned where the &lt;a href=\"Dust%20of%20Restful%20Death%20%28Item%29\"&gt;Dust of Restful Death&lt;/a&gt; was from &lt;a href=\"Gortwog%20gro-Nagorm\"&gt;Gortwog gro-Nagorm&lt;/a&gt;. Nagorm told the Agent was located somewhere in Balfiera, but it was considered to be in &lt;a href=\"the%20Masoleum%20of%20Darkivaron\"&gt;the Masoleum of Darkivaron&lt;/a&gt;. With the dust, Medora and the Agent were able to contact Lysandus, where they learned of his true fate. And so, Lord Woodborne was killed in his home, avenging Lysandus forever. Medora continued as the Castellan of Balfiera."}

It has been used for centuries as a neutral meeting place for diplomatic negotiations and treaty signings by the kingdoms of &lt;a href=\"High%20Rock\"&gt;High Rock&lt;/a&gt;. It consists of six islands, one is uninhabited. It is also famous for the enigmatic structure known as &lt;a href=\"Direnni%20Tower\"&gt;Direnni Tower&lt;/a&gt;, a circular tower soaring hundreds of feet into the air.\nThe traditional ruler of the island is known as the &lt;a href=\"Castellan%20of%20Balfiera\"&gt;Castellan of Balfiera&lt;/a&gt;, perhaps reflecting his original role as commander of Direnni Tower, which was used as a fortress, palace, and prison by the infamous &lt;a href=\"Direnni%20Hegemony\"&gt;Direnni Hegemony&lt;/a&gt;. Even more curiously, the hereditary Castellans are &lt;a href=\"High%20Elves\"&gt;High Elves&lt;/a&gt;, the only known &lt;a href=\"Mer\"&gt;Elven&lt;/a&gt; ruling family remaining in human lands. The Castellans continue to reside in the Tower, though its true provenance and purpose remains a mystery.\nHistory.\nA recent archaeological study, using the newer techniques of divination and sorcery of the &lt;a href=\"Third%20Era\"&gt;Third Era&lt;/a&gt;, has pushed the Tower's construction date back to around &lt;a href=\"ME%202500\"&gt;ME 2500&lt;/a&gt;, making it by far the oldest structure in &lt;a href=\"Tamriel\"&gt;Tamriel&lt;/a&gt;. Although it has been much modified and added onto over the years, its core is a smooth cylinder. The Tower is believed to extend at least as far beneath the surface as is now visible above, although its deepest bowels have never been systematically explored.\nFollowing the take-over of &lt;a href=\"Bisnensel\"&gt;Bisnensel&lt;/a&gt; by &lt;a href=\"High%20Priest%20Uluscant\"&gt;High Priest Uluscant&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"1E%20460\"&gt;1E 460&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Ayleid\"&gt;Ayleid&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"King%20Laloriaran%20Dynar\"&gt;King Laloriaran Dynar&lt;/a&gt; and his family fled to the island, where they were given sanctuary by the Direnni. He later became a tactician and strategist to the Direnni, and with his services &lt;a href=\"Hoag%20Merkiller\"&gt;Hoag Merkiller&lt;/a&gt; was defeated, and the &lt;a href=\"Battle%20of%20Glenumbra%20Moors%20%28Event%29\"&gt;Battle of Glenumbra Moors&lt;/a&gt; was won.\nIn &lt;a href=\"1E%202200\"&gt;1E 2200&lt;/a&gt;, when the &lt;a href=\"Thrassian%20Plague\"&gt;Thrassian Plague&lt;/a&gt; killed half of Tamriel's population, the island was used as a refuge for nobility from &lt;a href=\"Daggerfall%20%28City%29\"&gt;Daggerfall&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Sentinel%20%28Daggerfall%29\"&gt;Sentinel&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Wayrest%20%28City%29\"&gt;Wayrest&lt;/a&gt;.\nShortly before the &lt;a href=\"Warp%20in%20the%20West\"&gt;Warp in the West&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"Hero%20of%20Daggerfall\"&gt;Hero of Daggerfall&lt;/a&gt; came to the isle in &lt;a href=\"3E%20405\"&gt;3E 405&lt;/a&gt;, and rescued &lt;a href=\"Medora%20Direnni\"&gt;Medora Direnni&lt;/a&gt; from the Adamantine Tower.

Summerset is the largest region in the entire continent of Tamriel, with rolling hills throughout the land, and rugged mountains all over the coast. It is the birthplace of modern civilization in Tamriel, as well as the modern race of the &lt;a href=\"Elves\"&gt;Elves&lt;/a&gt;.\nDescription.\nGeography.\nNorthern Summerset.\nThe lands of Northern Summerset are very diverse, from the wetlands in the west coast to the rugged hills in the eastern Diren Valley. This region more or less surrounds the mountains of &lt;a href=\"Eton%20Nir\"&gt;Eton Nir&lt;/a&gt;. Areas in the east and west are not directly connected, with the only paths being through the scenic &lt;a href=\"King%27s%20Haven%20Pass\"&gt;King's Haven Pass&lt;/a&gt; and the not so scenic and more dangerous, &lt;a href=\"Karnwasten\"&gt;Karnwasten&lt;/a&gt;. The most notable settlements are the cities of &lt;a href=\"Cloudrest\"&gt;Cloudrest&lt;/a&gt;, which resides in the highest summit of Eton Nir, and &lt;a href=\"Lillandril\"&gt;Lillandril&lt;/a&gt;, on the western end of the wetlands that looks towards the &lt;a href=\"Sea%20of%20Pearls\"&gt;Sea of Pearls&lt;/a&gt;. Beyond that, the legendary forest of &lt;a href=\"Ebon%20Stadmont\"&gt;Ebon Stadmont&lt;/a&gt; sits on the rim of Eton Nir, just before the central vineyards.\nCentral Summerset.\nThe Plains of Central Summerset, also called Kingdom Fields, stretch from the western bay to the eastern coast, in this large stretch of open land, are the vineyards of &lt;a href=\"Russafeld\"&gt;Russafeld&lt;/a&gt;, perhaps the most famous winery in southwest Tamriel. To the southeast of the area are several ruins, including the &lt;a href=\"Keep%20of%20the%20Eleven%20Forces\"&gt;Keep of the Eleven Forces&lt;/a&gt; and the ruined estate of &lt;a href=\"Tor-Hame-Khard\"&gt;Tor-Hame-Khard&lt;/a&gt;. The largest settlement in the central plains is the city-state of &lt;a href=\"Shimmerene\"&gt;Shimmerene&lt;/a&gt;, which has earned the nickname of the City of Lights. On the other side of the region is the center of Summerset's theatre culture, the township of &lt;a href=\"Rellenthil\"&gt;Rellenthil&lt;/a&gt; has been the home of the &lt;a href=\"House%20of%20Reveries\"&gt;House of Reveries&lt;/a&gt; for many years, being well-renowned throughout the island.\nSouthern Summerset.\nSouthern Summerset, unofficially known as Varyllis is largely mountainous, with most of it inaccessible due to the perilous alps. Along the coastline is various ruins and caves, one notable here is the &lt;a href=\"Colossal%20Aldmeri%20Grotto\"&gt;Colossal Aldmeri Grotto&lt;/a&gt;, a vast cove utilized by the pirates of the ocean. The largest settlement is the city-state of &lt;a href=\"Alinor\"&gt;Alinor&lt;/a&gt;, which is the capital of the province, which is situated on the &lt;a href=\"Oleander%20Coast\"&gt;Oleander Coast&lt;/a&gt;. On the other side of the mountains is the city-state of &lt;a href=\"Sunhold\"&gt;Sunhold&lt;/a&gt;, which is equal in size as Alinor, serving as the home of the province's strongest navy. The city-state of &lt;a href=\"Dusk\"&gt;Dusk&lt;/a&gt; is located on the eastern coast, overlooking the sea south of &lt;a href=\"Auridon\"&gt;Auridon&lt;/a&gt;. This city anchors the region along with Alinor.\nFauna.\nIndrik.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Indrik\"&gt;Indrik&lt;/a&gt;s are a type of animal that can only be found in a place like Summerset. These creatures are found all throughout Summerset, primarily in Southern Summerset near the heights of &lt;a href=\"Archon%27s%20Grove\"&gt;Archon's Grove&lt;/a&gt; and the forests leading towards &lt;a href=\"Sunhold\"&gt;Sunhold&lt;/a&gt;. The Indrik can be very protective of their territory, utilizing &lt;a href=\"magicka\"&gt;magicka&lt;/a&gt; attacks to defend their grove. This can be seen when their feathers and fronds light up in specific colors. To move fast between areas, Indrik can teleport and even leave trails of fire. The Indrik have strong ties to &lt;a href=\"Jephre\"&gt;Jephre&lt;/a&gt;, the God of Nature to the Elves. It is said that their souls do not leave for &lt;a href=\"Aetherius\"&gt;Aetherius&lt;/a&gt;, Jephre instead plants them into the soil, so that they can grow into a newborn fawn. Within the vaults on &lt;a href=\"Artaeum\"&gt;Artaeum&lt;/a&gt;, there is a rare artifact called the &lt;a href=\"Heart%20of%20the%20Indrik\"&gt;Heart of the Indrik&lt;/a&gt;, which is a crystallized heart of an Indrik, that was bathed in water for roughly one-hundred days. A regular heart is even valued by the artists of Summerset.\nWelwa.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Welwa\"&gt;Welwa&lt;/a&gt; were among the original inhabitants of the Summerset Isles but like the &lt;a href=\"Ilyadi\"&gt;Ilyadi&lt;/a&gt; and the Ghaeteus, the Welwa were wiped out by the Aldmer colonials. But unlike the other creatures, the Welwa were not completely gone, being known to roam freely in the region of &lt;a href=\"Craglorn\"&gt;Craglorn&lt;/a&gt;, in the province of &lt;a href=\"Hammerfell\"&gt;Hammerfell&lt;/a&gt;. The Welwas in Craglorn are akin to common fauna, having long streaks of fur in brown and white, as well as razor sharp claws and piercing horns. Welwas travel in packs and are found primarily throughout the plains of &lt;a href=\"Central%20Summerset\"&gt;Central Summerset&lt;/a&gt; and the wetlands near &lt;a href=\"Lillandril\"&gt;Lillandril&lt;/a&gt;. Depicts of Welwa seen in the Crystal Tower are of holy beasts of horns and teeth, which is not far from reality. Welwas are capable of being tamed, being the hounds of Craglorn. The &lt;a href=\"Iron%20Orcs\"&gt;Iron Orcs&lt;/a&gt; of Craglorn utilize them as battle-pets while in Summerset, they are capable of being researched by the Sapiarchs. Sometime in &lt;a href=\"2E%20583\"&gt;2E 583&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Ambolisse\"&gt;Ambolisse&lt;/a&gt;, the Sapiarch of Zoological Studies, was able to bring back the Welwa into Summerset. For the first time in years, packs of Welwa had begun to appear in Summerset, near Shimmerene and Russafeld.\nReef Viper.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Reef%20Viper\"&gt;Reef Viper&lt;/a&gt;s are serpentine-winged creatures that are common all throughout the &lt;a href=\"Eltheric%20Ocean\"&gt;Eltheric Ocean&lt;/a&gt;, primarily everything south of &lt;a href=\"Khefrem\"&gt;Khefrem&lt;/a&gt; in Hammerfell, looking towards the &lt;a href=\"Sea%20of%20Pearls\"&gt;Sea of Pearls&lt;/a&gt;. Reef Vipers are large creatures that reside in alcoves along the coast, from &lt;a href=\"Sea%20Keep\"&gt;Sea Keep&lt;/a&gt; to the island of &lt;a href=\"Wasten%20Coridale\"&gt;Wasten Coridale&lt;/a&gt;. Reef Vipers can glide along the air, unlike most serpents. They disperse venom in various ways, through the typical bite, or excreting fumes of it. Egg clusters are found all throughout their nest. Typically, the Reef Viper, along with the &lt;a href=\"Sea%20Serpent\"&gt;Sea Serpent&lt;/a&gt; are utilized by the &lt;a href=\"Maormer\"&gt;Maormer&lt;/a&gt; of Pyandonea, as battle-pets/mounts. These creatures are an inspiration of the Sea Elves armor and equipment. Their ships have serpent figureheads, and their armor itself has fins and wings reminiscent of the Reef Viper.\nGheateus &amp; Ilyadi.\nAmong the original inhabits, the &lt;a href=\"Gheateus\"&gt;Gheateus&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Ilyadi\"&gt;Ilyadi&lt;/a&gt; were the most prominent. Both creatures are as legendary as the Welwa were depicted in Ancient Altmeri lore. Both creatures are categorized as &lt;a href=\"Faerie\"&gt;Faerie&lt;/a&gt;, which have lived on Tamriel, before the earliest of records. Faeries are unpredictable by nature. The Gheateus are known to be a group of men, that are formed from the earth itself, similar to the &lt;a href=\"Hollow\"&gt;Hollow&lt;/a&gt; found in &lt;a href=\"Greenshade\"&gt;Greenshade&lt;/a&gt;. Gheateus are considered godlike and are known to host a minor &lt;a href=\"Sylphim\"&gt;Sylphim&lt;/a&gt;, which are another variant of Faerie, seen beyond the Gheateus in a hierarchical system known as the &lt;a href=\"Faerie%20Chain%20Theory\"&gt;Faerie Chain Theory&lt;/a&gt;, which originates from &lt;a href=\"Ahrtabazus\"&gt;Ahrtabazus&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"2E%20456\"&gt;2E 456&lt;/a&gt;. Though technically, Faeries are neither followers nor leaders. Meanwhile, the Ilyadi are considered one of the godliest creatures on Tamriel, taller than the forests of Summerset. They are forest giants, containing many-eyes and overshadowing the land. As of now, these creatures are completely extinct on Summerset, but have left an impact on Summerset culture, bring referenced even in modern times.\nGryphon.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Gryphon\"&gt;Gryphon&lt;/a&gt;s, otherwise known as the Griffin are creatures revered throughout the Isle of Summerset, recognized as honored creatures by the High Elves. Since the earliest records of Summerset, the Altmer have dreamed of taming these animals and gliding through the air, from Eton Nir to the Southern Mountains, but have failed. Until in early &lt;a href=\"Sunhold\"&gt;Sunhold&lt;/a&gt;, an Aldmer tribesman, &lt;a href=\"Ulorome\"&gt;Ulorome&lt;/a&gt; had brought home a Gryphon egg back to his tribe, where it eventually hatched and was tamed by Ulorome's tribe. That baby Gryphon, as fiery as a phoenix was named &lt;a href=\"Cel-himwe\"&gt;Cel-himwe&lt;/a&gt;, and his descendants became revered throughout the Summerset Isles, becoming Sunhold's fame line of Gryphons. From then on, High Elves tamed the Gryphons. The &lt;a href=\"Welkynar%20Gryphon%20Riders\"&gt;Welkynar Gryphon Riders&lt;/a&gt; are sworn protectors of Summerset, being stationed in the city-state of &lt;a href=\"Cloudrest\"&gt;Cloudrest&lt;/a&gt;. Gryphons are continued to be celebrated throughout Summerset.\nFlora.\nThe Isle of Summerset is the largest region in all of Tamriel, though the environment is not as diverse as say, the north or the province of Cyrodiil. Summerset has been described as being filled with fertile farmlands, woodland parks, and ancient manors dotting the landscape. There are several locations that are worth noting, one such is the forests of &lt;a href=\"Ebon%20Stadmont\"&gt;Ebon Stadmont&lt;/a&gt;, located along the base of &lt;a href=\"Eton%20Nir\"&gt;Eton Nir&lt;/a&gt;. Ebon Stadmont is an endless maze of groves, easy for the common passersby to be lost. It is covered in a heavy shroud of mist, with ancient ruins containing an unknown language.\nAcross the plains of Summerset is the legendary vineyard, &lt;a href=\"Russafeld\"&gt;Russafeld&lt;/a&gt;, which grows the richest wine seen on the isles. Kinlords and Canonreeves from all over travel to Russafeld for their wine. Along the coastline are forests of coral, and lagoons housing the local &lt;a href=\"Coral%20Crab\"&gt;Coral Crab&lt;/a&gt;s. The fields of &lt;a href=\"Archon%27s%20Grove\"&gt;Archon's Grove&lt;/a&gt; is sacred to &lt;a href=\"Mara\"&gt;Mara&lt;/a&gt;, the Goddess of Fertility. In this area grows the &lt;a href=\"Rose-of-Archon\"&gt;Rose-of-Archon&lt;/a&gt;. According to legend, &lt;a href=\"Nenamil\"&gt;Nenamil&lt;/a&gt;, the Archon of Song, who sang ballads of Mara and sought to meet the Goddess herself. And so he embarked on a journey to meet the Goddess of Love until he came upon what would become Archon's Grove, and found the Rose-of-Archon. From then on, he realized that Mara was beauty itself, and dedicated his life to spreading his teachings far and wide. The rose was named after his revelation.\nGovernment.\nThroughout the eras, the leader of Summerset has been the King/Queen of Alinor, making the province a wide-spread Kingdom. The monarch rules out of the &lt;a href=\"Alinor%20Royal%20Palace\"&gt;Alinor Royal Palace&lt;/a&gt; that overlooks the Oleander Coast. But will the Monarch of Alinor has total control, below them, that enforces the laws of Summerset Isle, is the &lt;a href=\"Office%20of%20Divine%20Prosecution\"&gt;Office of Divine Prosecution&lt;/a&gt;. The Prosecution has various ranks, including the Canonreeve, the Bureaureeve, and the Vicereeve, each with different purposes. The Divine Prosecution not only deal with laws from the Court of Alinor, but they deal in stuff regarding religion and culture. Members of the Divine Prosecution are known as Justiciars, which are the high-ranking enforcers and soldiers of the faction.\nLeaders of Summerset cities are known as Kinlords/Kinladies, which are the equivalent to the Dukes and Counts of the mainland. These people are the nobility of Summerset and have kinhouses that overlook the entire settlement. Leaders of smaller settlements in the province are known as Canonreeves. With every iteration of the &lt;a href=\"Aldmeri%20Dominion\"&gt;Aldmeri Dominion&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"Thalmor\"&gt;Thalmor&lt;/a&gt; had ruled over it. Originally a bureau of safeguarding High Elven heritage, the Thalmor is a ruling body of government consisting of the leaders of Aldmeri Dominion, which includes the leader of Valenwood, ideally someone from the &lt;a href=\"Camoran%20Dynasty\"&gt;Camoran Dynasty&lt;/a&gt;, and the leader of &lt;a href=\"Elsweyr\"&gt;Elsweyr&lt;/a&gt;, both the &lt;a href=\"Mane\"&gt;Mane&lt;/a&gt; and the Speaker of the Mane. These people coordinate the Aldmeri Dominion from behind the lines.\nReligion.\nThe High Elves, and by extension, some of the other elven races, worship the &lt;a href=\"Aldmeri%20Pantheon\"&gt;Aldmeri Pantheon&lt;/a&gt;, which holds several likenesses to the &lt;a href=\"Eight%20Divines\"&gt;Eight Divines&lt;/a&gt; of the Imperial Empires. More notably with the elven god, &lt;a href=\"Auri-El\"&gt;Auri-El&lt;/a&gt;, the Elven God of Time and chief deity of the pantheon. Auri-El's likeness can be seen in &lt;a href=\"Akatosh\"&gt;Akatosh&lt;/a&gt;, the Imperial Dragon God of Time. In the elven mythos, Auri-El is the soul of &lt;a href=\"Anui-El\"&gt;Anui-El&lt;/a&gt; and by extension, the soul of &lt;a href=\"Anu\"&gt;Anu&lt;/a&gt;, the representation of existence. The Elves have considered themselves as direct descendants of Auri-El, and because of this, they have held themselves in the utmost regard when compared to the other races. The &lt;a href=\"Monastery%20of%20Serene%20Harmony\"&gt;Monastery of Serene Harmony&lt;/a&gt; in Shimmerene is a large temple dedicated to Auri-El and the Elven pantheon, overlooking the entire coast. Auri-El's prized artifact is &lt;a href=\"Auriel%27s%20Bow\"&gt;Auriel's Bow&lt;/a&gt;, which draws the forces of &lt;a href=\"Aetherius\"&gt;Aetherius&lt;/a&gt; and channels it through the sun, finally unleashing an arrow of radiant energy. It was last seen in the north, in the Skyrim border.\nThere are, of course, more members of the pantheon and not just Auri-El, for example, the most universally worship deity in Tamriel, &lt;a href=\"Mara\"&gt;Mara&lt;/a&gt; has a strong influence all throughout Summerset. On a certain day, the High Elves celebrate the &lt;a href=\"Day%20of%20Divine%20Reverence\"&gt;Day of Divine Reverence&lt;/a&gt;, which honors Mara. Deep in the southern mountains, the sacred site of &lt;a href=\"Archon%27s%20Grove\"&gt;Archon's Grove&lt;/a&gt; holds the &lt;a href=\"Rose-of-Archon\"&gt;Rose-of-Archon&lt;/a&gt;, which is a flower that emphasizes Mara's beauty. The &lt;a href=\"Sapiarchs\"&gt;Sapiarchs&lt;/a&gt; near &lt;a href=\"Lillandril\"&gt;Lillandril&lt;/a&gt; gather the flower for a holiday, which lasts over a month. The god known as &lt;a href=\"Phynaster\"&gt;Phynaster&lt;/a&gt; is considered the hero-god of the Summerset Isles, teaching his people how to naturally live for another hundred years with no one breaking his stride, and nobody slowing him down. Phynaster was essentially able to live for several more years using nothing but a walking stride. The &lt;a href=\"Ring%20of%20Phynaster\"&gt;Ring of Phynaster&lt;/a&gt; reflects Phynaster's story. When a man needed good defense against the dangers in his adventurous walk, he was gifted the ring, and the diseases that plagued Tamriel were unable to affect the man. But Phynaster had cursed the ring and eventually, the ring disappears, only to return to Phynaster. These, of course, are not the only gods worshipped by the High Elves of Summerset Isle.\nCulture &amp; economy.\nThe Isle of Summerset is the center of the Altmeri population, and so their culture is celebrated greatly within the entire continent. The High Elves are some of the brightest minds in all of Tamriel, as various groups such as the &lt;a href=\"Sapiarchs\"&gt;Sapiarchs&lt;/a&gt; and institutes such as the &lt;a href=\"Illumination%20Academy\"&gt;Illumination Academy&lt;/a&gt; are found here. The Sapiarchs are the greatest minds of Summerset, each studying different fields from the &lt;a href=\"College%20of%20Sapiarchs\"&gt;College of Sapiarchs&lt;/a&gt; located off the coast from &lt;a href=\"Lillandril\"&gt;Lillandril&lt;/a&gt;. These fields include but are not limited to \"Arcanology,\" \"Naval Excognition,\" and \"Transliminal Travels.\" Many High Elves go to great lengths to be accepted into the College of Sapiarchs, while the monarchy of Summerset would learn at the College of Sapiarchs before becoming leaders of the province. Two Sapiarchs are tasked as Keepers of the &lt;a href=\"Crystal%20Tower\"&gt;Crystal Tower&lt;/a&gt;, residing at the base of &lt;a href=\"Eton%20Nir\"&gt;Eton Nir&lt;/a&gt; to guard the entrance of the tower. All the while in Central Summerset, the &lt;a href=\"Russafeld\"&gt;Russafeld&lt;/a&gt; winery is the largest in all of the isles, and it produces the province's wine, as &lt;a href=\"Russafeld%20Red\"&gt;Russafeld Red&lt;/a&gt; is the most enjoyed wine in all of Summerset. It is shipped across the sub-continent. Considering the island's location, naval trading plays a big role in the Isle of Summerset as most cities, excluding &lt;a href=\"Cloudrest\"&gt;Cloudrest&lt;/a&gt; have port yards. In fact, most cities are prime stops for the &lt;a href=\"East%20Empire%20Company\"&gt;East Empire Company&lt;/a&gt;. The &lt;a href=\"House%20of%20Reveries\"&gt;House of Reveries&lt;/a&gt; in the town of &lt;a href=\"Rellenthil\"&gt;Rellenthil&lt;/a&gt; is the heart and soul of theatrical culture in Summerset. Many people, of all races, gather to Rellenthil to become one of the troupe, and they undergo various plays and other performances for the elites and commoners of Summerset. Despite what people think about the Altmer, the House of Reveries are true to their heart, and while not use the art of theatre as a stepping-stone in the universal hierarchy of the Summerset Isles. Even though the High Elves secluded themselves from Tamriel, they are a thriving and modern culture that gives the land the character is praised by its own people.\nHistory.\n&lt;a href=\"Merethic%20Era\"&gt;Merethic Era&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe Aldmeri Expansion onto Summerset.\nWith their ancestral homeland of &lt;a href=\"Aldmeris\"&gt;Aldmeris&lt;/a&gt; looming away in the distance, the &lt;a href=\"Aldmer\"&gt;Aldmer&lt;/a&gt; travel to the north, where they arrived on the shores of the modern-day Summerset Isles and leading the helm was &lt;a href=\"High%20Lord%20Torinaan\"&gt;High Lord Torinaan&lt;/a&gt;, who landed on the shores of &lt;a href=\"Auridon\"&gt;Auridon&lt;/a&gt;, establishing the city-state of &lt;a href=\"Firsthold\"&gt;Firsthold&lt;/a&gt;, where the rest of the Elves spread across into Summerset Isle. Before they lived there, creatures of legends such as the &lt;a href=\"Gheateus\"&gt;Gheateus&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Illyadi\"&gt;Illyadi&lt;/a&gt; had prospered on the land, to which the Elves had dispatched to nigh extinction. But even before Summerset was untamed, ancient ruins and structures had dotted the landscape, from the &lt;a href=\"Ceporah%20Tower\"&gt;Ceporah Tower&lt;/a&gt; on &lt;a href=\"Artaeum\"&gt;Artaeum&lt;/a&gt;, to the ruins of modern-day &lt;a href=\"Cloudrest\"&gt;Cloudrest&lt;/a&gt;. Eventually, the land had grown into a booming civilization, from lowly farmers and tribes to wealth clans and merchant lords. Settlements such as &lt;a href=\"Alinor\"&gt;Alinor&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Sunhold\"&gt;Sunhold&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Skywatch\"&gt;Skywatch&lt;/a&gt; had grown into large kingdoms, with the former becoming the modern-day capital. But out of this rising civilization, none was held more sacred than the &lt;a href=\"Crystal%20Tower\"&gt;Crystal Tower&lt;/a&gt;, a vast tower that overlooks the entire land from the heights of &lt;a href=\"Eton%20Nir\"&gt;Eton Nir&lt;/a&gt;. In it houses the crystal known as &lt;a href=\"Transparent%20Law\"&gt;Transparent Law&lt;/a&gt;, which protects the island from the threats of &lt;a href=\"Oblivion\"&gt;Oblivion&lt;/a&gt;, reminiscent of the &lt;a href=\"Dragonfires\"&gt;Dragonfires&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Cyrodiil\"&gt;Cyrodiil&lt;/a&gt;. The Crystal Tower is considered the beacon of hope, as well as the symbol of everything the Elves hold dear. Many scale the mountain to learn from the halls of Crystal-Like-Law.\nThe elven races of Tamriel; beyond Summerset.\nAs time went on, the Elves had grown contempt with the Blessed Isles, and so had decided to move beyond the realms of Summerset, and into the mainland of &lt;a href=\"Tamriel\"&gt;Tamriel&lt;/a&gt;, where the &lt;a href=\"Beastfolk\"&gt;Beastfolk&lt;/a&gt; had reigned over since the dawn of time. Many sects of Elves had moved out the Summerset Isles and into the lands of Tamriel, with the first being the &lt;a href=\"Dwarves\"&gt;Dwarves&lt;/a&gt;, who moved into the wastelands of modern-day &lt;a href=\"Morrowind\"&gt;Morrowind&lt;/a&gt;, out of the sub-continent of &lt;a href=\"Vvardenfell\"&gt;Vvardenfell&lt;/a&gt;. The Dwemer were well ahead of their time, building automatons and steam-powered machinery that the races of Tamriel have yet to fully-utilized. Of these movements, none was more well-known than the followers of &lt;a href=\"Veloth\"&gt;Veloth&lt;/a&gt;, a wealthy &lt;a href=\"Chimer\"&gt;Chimer&lt;/a&gt;i noble that heeded the words of &lt;a href=\"Boethiah\"&gt;Boethiah&lt;/a&gt;, gathering his followers for the promised land, which is Morrowind. As time went on, the Chimer changed into the modern-day race of the &lt;a href=\"Dark%20Elves\"&gt;Dark Elves&lt;/a&gt;. Part of why Veloth left Summerset was because of the nobilities ill-treatment of the unfortunate, and homeless, and so he and his people had left. But the Chimer were not the only ones to leave of the haughty nature of the Elves.\nA sect of Elves traveled across the &lt;a href=\"Cape%20of%20the%20Blue%20Divide\"&gt;Cape of the Blue Divide&lt;/a&gt;, where they settled onto the lands of &lt;a href=\"Valenwood\"&gt;Valenwood&lt;/a&gt;. Here, the Aldmer became the modern-day &lt;a href=\"Wood%20Elves\"&gt;Wood Elves&lt;/a&gt;, following divine laws known as the &lt;a href=\"Green%20Pact\"&gt;Green Pact&lt;/a&gt;, which resulted in their exclusively-carnivorous lifestyle, protecting the Green to their death. In legends, when Boethiah defeated &lt;a href=\"Trinimac\"&gt;Trinimac&lt;/a&gt; and swallowed him whole, the waste that was left behind became &lt;a href=\"Malacath\"&gt;Malacath&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"Daedric%20Prince\"&gt;Daedric Prince&lt;/a&gt; of Sworn Oaths. Malacath had become a vile form of his former-self, along with his followers, which became the Pariah-folk, the &lt;a href=\"Orsimer\"&gt;Orsimer&lt;/a&gt;. The Orcs moved north towards the &lt;a href=\"Wrothgarian%20Mountains\"&gt;Wrothgarian Mountains&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Dragontail%20Mountains\"&gt;Dragontail Mountains&lt;/a&gt;. Another well-known movement was the &lt;a href=\"Ayleids\"&gt;Ayleids&lt;/a&gt;, who were the first to establish an Empire in the continent of Tamriel, ruling out of the modern-day &lt;a href=\"Imperial%20City\"&gt;Imperial City&lt;/a&gt;. The Ayleids worship the &lt;a href=\"Daedra\"&gt;Daedra&lt;/a&gt;, much to the dismay of the Aldmer, and so they left Summerset and established their illustrious Kingdom, using the &lt;a href=\"Nedes\"&gt;Nedes&lt;/a&gt; as slaves. The Ayleids went extinct when the Nedes rebelled in the &lt;a href=\"Alessian%20Slave%20Rebellion\"&gt;Alessian Slave Rebellion&lt;/a&gt; in the first era. The Aldmer that remained on the Summerset Isles became the &lt;a href=\"High%20Elves\"&gt;High Elves&lt;/a&gt;, who have kept their ways to this day. Other races such as the &lt;a href=\"Snow%20Elves\"&gt;Snow Elves&lt;/a&gt; moved to modern-day &lt;a href=\"Skyrim\"&gt;Skyrim&lt;/a&gt; and others such as the &lt;a href=\"Maormer\"&gt;Maormer&lt;/a&gt; traveled to the island continent of &lt;a href=\"Pyandonea\"&gt;Pyandonea&lt;/a&gt;, beyond Tamrielic waters.\n&lt;a href=\"First%20Era\"&gt;First Era&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe Undocumented Era of War in Summerset Isle.\nAs the races of Tamriel flourished, with the fall of the Ayleids, the creation of the &lt;a href=\"First%20Empire\"&gt;First Empire&lt;/a&gt;, and the &lt;a href=\"Battle%20of%20Red%20Mountain\"&gt;Battle of Red Mountain&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"1E%20700\"&gt;1E 700&lt;/a&gt;, the High Elves of Summerset remained isolated, dealing with their own internal conflicts. Because of how isolated the High Elves were, the history at this time was largely undocumented, save for several conflicts. The Kingdoms of Summerset constantly waged war with each other, between Alinor and Lillandril, and between &lt;a href=\"Firsthold\"&gt;Firsthold&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Skywatch\"&gt;Skywatch&lt;/a&gt;, among others. But with these conflicts, the &lt;a href=\"Sload\"&gt;Sload&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"Thras\"&gt;Thras&lt;/a&gt; would constantly attack them, hitting with the most ungodly and repulsing method they had in hand. Conflicts such as the &lt;a href=\"War%20of%20the%20Uvichil\"&gt;War of the Uvichil&lt;/a&gt;, which lasted from &lt;a href=\"1E%202911\"&gt;1E 2911&lt;/a&gt; to &lt;a href=\"1E%202917\"&gt;1E 2917&lt;/a&gt;. But beyond the warfare, none had hit Summerset more was the &lt;a href=\"Thrassian%20Plague\"&gt;Thrassian Plague&lt;/a&gt;, which occurred in &lt;a href=\"1E%202200\"&gt;1E 2200&lt;/a&gt;. The Plague was virtually unstoppable, prompting settlements such as the ancient city-state of &lt;a href=\"Corgrad%20Wastes\"&gt;Corgrad Wastes&lt;/a&gt; to utilize very questionable means of survival. The Kinlord of Corgrad had issued a decree that proclaimed that every citizen is forbidden from leaving the city-state, and eventually, Corgrad had sunken into the shores of the &lt;a href=\"Sea%20of%20Pearls\"&gt;Sea of Pearls&lt;/a&gt;, where their residents remain in the underground, all the way into the second era. But out of this conflict, the Apprentice-God, &lt;a href=\"Syrabane\"&gt;Syrabane&lt;/a&gt; had repelled the plague and the Sload to their home of Thras, to which it was sunken into the ocean. From then on, Syrabane became a part of the &lt;a href=\"Altmeri%20Pantheon\"&gt;Altmeri Pantheon&lt;/a&gt;. Along with the Sload, the Maormer of Pyandonea would fight against the High Elves, attempting to control Summerset, with &lt;a href=\"King%20Orgnum\"&gt;King Orgnum&lt;/a&gt; leading their cause.\n&lt;a href=\"Second%20Era\"&gt;Second Era&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe Unforeseen Queen; the Tale of Ayrenn.\nThe continent of Tamriel would be forever changed with the death of &lt;a href=\"Reman%20Cyrodiil%20III\"&gt;Reman Cyrodiil III&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"1E%202920\"&gt;1E 2920&lt;/a&gt;, for better or for worse, mostly the latter. However, the Summerset Isles, peace had been issued for many years. The long-running &lt;a href=\"Alinor%20Royal%20Family\"&gt;Alinor Royal Family&lt;/a&gt; had been observing the province well. For quite some time, Summerset Isle was ruled by &lt;a href=\"King%20Hidellith\"&gt;King Hidellith&lt;/a&gt;, who like others, would soon pass the crown to his heir, and that person was &lt;a href=\"Ayrenn%20Arana%20Aldmeri\"&gt;Ayrenn Arana Aldmeri&lt;/a&gt;, whose birth has left Summerset wondering. Princess Ayrenn was born on the 5th of &lt;a href=\"Second%20Seed\"&gt;Second Seed&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"2E%20555\"&gt;2E 555&lt;/a&gt;, a very auspicious year that has left all of the Summerset Isles celebrating for fifty-five days. Ayrenn was a special as her birthdate, she was quick-nimble and brilliant, as well as a quick learner, a prodigy among prodigies. According to rumors, she would disappear on field trips, only too come back with a newly-mastered skill. But on the &lt;a href=\"Evening%20Star\"&gt;Evening Star&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"2E%20563\"&gt;2E 563&lt;/a&gt;, when her family traveled to the &lt;a href=\"Crystal%20Tower\"&gt;Crystal Tower&lt;/a&gt; to celebrate the beginning of her time in the &lt;a href=\"College%20of%20Sapiarchs\"&gt;College of Sapiarchs&lt;/a&gt;, she disappeared off of the province. The highest-ranked &lt;a href=\"Thalmor\"&gt;Thalmor&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Divine%20Prosecution\"&gt;Divine Prosecution&lt;/a&gt; were unable to find her. With no other choice, her younger brother, &lt;a href=\"Naemon\"&gt;Naemon&lt;/a&gt; enrolled in the College at her place, learning for 3,555. Naemon was to inherit the throne. But when news of Hidellith's death in &lt;a href=\"2E%20580\"&gt;2E 580&lt;/a&gt;, Ayrenn reappeared from the township of &lt;a href=\"Port%20Velyn\"&gt;Port Velyn&lt;/a&gt;, to reclaim her birthright of Alinor. Ayrenn had come back a changed person, ready to lead her province to glory. She was crowned on the 7th of &lt;a href=\"Frostfall\"&gt;Frostfall&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe Return of Queen Ayrenn; the Aldmeri Dominion.\nIn &lt;a href=\"2E%20580\"&gt;2E 580&lt;/a&gt;, Ayrenn Arana Aldmeri returned to the Summerset Isles when news of King Hidellith had reached her. Ayrenn assumed the &lt;a href=\"Throne%20of%20Alinor\"&gt;Throne of Alinor&lt;/a&gt;, with Prince Naemon at her side, and with her father's sword armed. At the time, control over the Imperial City had been sought after ever since the death of Reman Cyrodiil III. Ayrenn established an alliance with the &lt;a href=\"Wood%20Elves\"&gt;Wood Elves&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"Valenwood\"&gt;Valenwood&lt;/a&gt;, led by &lt;a href=\"King%20Camoran%20Aeradan\"&gt;King Camoran Aeradan&lt;/a&gt;, and the &lt;a href=\"Khajiit\"&gt;Khajiit&lt;/a&gt;s of &lt;a href=\"Elsweyr\"&gt;Elsweyr&lt;/a&gt;, led by &lt;a href=\"Mane\"&gt;Mane&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Akkhuz-ri\"&gt;Akkhuz-ri&lt;/a&gt;. This newly-found alliance was the &lt;a href=\"First%20Aldmeri%20Dominion\"&gt;First Aldmeri Dominion&lt;/a&gt;, and so they took to the plains of Cyrodiil seeking control over the province in the &lt;a href=\"Alliance%20War\"&gt;Alliance War&lt;/a&gt;. Because of this, Ayrenn had named the city-state of &lt;a href=\"Elden%20Root\"&gt;Elden Root&lt;/a&gt;, the capital of the Dominion. To focus on the war effort, Ayrenn took residence in Elden Root, while her older cousin, &lt;a href=\"Alwinarwe\"&gt;Alwinarwe&lt;/a&gt; taking the position of the Proxy Queen in Alinor. With her coronation as the leader of Summerset, she sought to prove herself as a worthy leader to the rest of the Dominion, leaving Summerset Isle on &lt;a href=\"2E%20582\"&gt;2E 582&lt;/a&gt; for the island of &lt;a href=\"Auridon\"&gt;Auridon&lt;/a&gt;, and eventually Elden Root and &lt;a href=\"Dune\"&gt;Dune&lt;/a&gt;. Many people on Summerset were naturally opposed to this alliance, considering their disdain towards the races of the mainland. Because of this, there have been many instances of treachery, specifically with a group known as the &lt;a href=\"Veiled%20Heritance\"&gt;Veiled Heritance&lt;/a&gt;, created by &lt;a href=\"High%20Kinlady%20Estre\"&gt;High Kinlady Estre&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"Skywatch\"&gt;Skywatch&lt;/a&gt;. The Heritance had taken actions of taking over &lt;a href=\"Firsthold\"&gt;Firsthold&lt;/a&gt;, stealing the &lt;a href=\"Staff%20of%20Magnus\"&gt;Staff of Magnus&lt;/a&gt;, and resurrecting a vengeful Naemon. But eventually, Ayrenn persevered and the Dominion had grown, bringing change to the Isle of Summerset.\nThe Queen's Decree; A Wave of Newcomers.\nDuring the &lt;a href=\"Interregnum\"&gt;Interregnum&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"2E%20583\"&gt;2E 583&lt;/a&gt;, Queen Ayrenn Arana Aldmeri had temporarily ended Summerset's time of isolation with the &lt;a href=\"Queen%27s%20Decree\"&gt;Queen's Decree&lt;/a&gt;, a document which proclaimed that the Summerset Isle would be open to foreigners, offering a new opportunity. But naturally, the High Elves of Summerset were opposed to this statement, with some going so far as to slander the Queen, calling her a harbinger of their destruction. But out of this, the most vocal person is &lt;a href=\"Kinlady%20Avinisse\"&gt;Kinlady Avinisse&lt;/a&gt;, leader of &lt;a href=\"Shimmerene\"&gt;Shimmerene&lt;/a&gt;. Like many others, Avinisse's argument was that bringing in newcomers was illogical, considering their vast superiority to the other races and their direct connection to the &lt;a href=\"Aedra\"&gt;Aedra&lt;/a&gt; and Aldmeri. Purely because of this, Kinlady Avinisse is against the Queen's Decree, but regardless, Shimmerene accepted ships from all over Tamriel. But fortunately, various Altmeri have accepted the new faces, one such person is &lt;a href=\"Kinlord%20Andurion\"&gt;Kinlord Andurion&lt;/a&gt;, a member of the Court of Summerset. When his son perished in the &lt;a href=\"Alliance%20War\"&gt;Alliance War&lt;/a&gt;, a fellow warrior of &lt;a href=\"Bosmer\"&gt;Bosmer&lt;/a&gt;i origins had brought his ashes back to Summerset. Because of the honor that this warrior presented, Andurion had opened up to the idea of newcomers, considering the state of the Alliance War, where High Elves, Wood Elves, and Khajiits are dying together in the war-torn realms of Cyrodiil. With the Queen's Decree, the ties that make up the Aldmeri Dominion had grown strong. But coincidentally, with the wave of new arrivals, a plot that had been festering for years had been finally put to action in Summerset, beginning in Shimmerene with the new Aldarch of the &lt;a href=\"Monastery%20of%20Serene%20Harmony\"&gt;Monastery of Serene Harmony&lt;/a&gt;.\nFrom the Shadows of the Triad; the Court of Bedlam.\nKinlady Avinisse had given the position of Aldarch to the Altmer, &lt;a href=\"Tilcalar\"&gt;Tilcalar&lt;/a&gt;, who is of unknown origins. Tilcalar and Avinisse took to dealing with the new wave of immigrants by taking them away but low and behold, Tilcalar had tasked the monks of the monastery with killing these newcomers, without Avinisse's knowing. Because of these missing newcomers, this brought attention to the &lt;a href=\"Eyes%20of%20the%20Queen\"&gt;Eyes of the Queen&lt;/a&gt;, a spy intelligence network that works for Queen Ayrenn. Their most esteemed member, &lt;a href=\"Razum-dar\"&gt;Razum-dar&lt;/a&gt; had undergone investigation in Shimmerene, prompting help from an old friend, a &lt;a href=\"Vestige\"&gt;Newcomer&lt;/a&gt; that was one of the new arrivals from &lt;a href=\"Alinor\"&gt;Alinor&lt;/a&gt;. Eventually, their investigation involved a third party, the &lt;a href=\"Psijic%20Order\"&gt;Psijic Order&lt;/a&gt;, through the Altmeri mage, &lt;a href=\"Valsirenn\"&gt;Valsirenn&lt;/a&gt;. As time went on, it was revealed that Aldarch Tilcalar was a member of the &lt;a href=\"Court%20of%20Bedlam\"&gt;Court of Bedlam&lt;/a&gt;, as well as the Earl of &lt;a href=\"Clavicus%20Vile\"&gt;Clavicus Vile&lt;/a&gt;. Tilcalar escaped the Monastery of Serene Harmony to the &lt;a href=\"Coral%20Forest\"&gt;Coral Forest&lt;/a&gt; near &lt;a href=\"Sil-Var-Woad\"&gt;Sil-Var-Woad&lt;/a&gt;. It was there the Earl was defeated, and an &lt;a href=\"Abyssal%20Pearl\"&gt;Abyssal Pearl&lt;/a&gt; was taken to the &lt;a href=\"Ceporah%20Tower\"&gt;Ceporah Tower&lt;/a&gt; on &lt;a href=\"Artaeum\"&gt;Artaeum&lt;/a&gt;. This incident had revealed a much larger scheme, which prompted twin investigations between Razum-dar and the Psijic Order. The Court of Bedlam had allied with the &lt;a href=\"Abyssal%20Cabal\"&gt;Abyssal Cabal&lt;/a&gt;, a group of &lt;a href=\"Sea%20Sload\"&gt;Sea Sload&lt;/a&gt; that desire to sink Summerset Isle and claim it as their own. They, as well as, the Court had begun to make their move, with their first big strike being the &lt;a href=\"Rellenthil%20Sinkhole\"&gt;Rellenthil Sinkhole&lt;/a&gt;.\nNocturnal's grasp over the Crystal Tower &amp; Aftermath.\nFrom within the shadows, the Court of Bedlam and the Abyssal Cabal worked towards the Crystal Tower. The Daedra killed one of the Keepers of the Crystal Tower. The &lt;a href=\"College%20of%20Sapiarchs\"&gt;College of Sapiarchs&lt;/a&gt; was raided by the Court of Bedlam, &lt;a href=\"Iachesis\"&gt;Iachesis&lt;/a&gt; of the &lt;a href=\"Psijic%20Order\"&gt;Psijic Order&lt;/a&gt; was killed amidst the conflict, and the Heart of &lt;a href=\"Transparent%20Law\"&gt;Transparent Law&lt;/a&gt; was recovered by &lt;a href=\"Nocturnal\"&gt;Nocturnal&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"Daedric%20Prince\"&gt;Daedric Prince&lt;/a&gt; of Darkness. The Triad between Nocturnal, &lt;a href=\"Mephala\"&gt;Mephala&lt;/a&gt;, and Clavicus Vile had been dissolved, with Nocturnal reaching nigh-infinite power, beyond the realms of &lt;a href=\"Mundus\"&gt;Mundus&lt;/a&gt;. At this point, the region of Summerset was fending off the waves of Daedra storming the lands, from Alinor to the Diren Valley. With the Crystal Tower in the grasps of the &lt;a href=\"Evergloam\"&gt;Evergloam&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"Sapiarchs\"&gt;Sapiarchs&lt;/a&gt; within the tower were killed and halls of the Tower were pockets in &lt;a href=\"Oblivion\"&gt;Oblivion&lt;/a&gt;. With the help of a &lt;a href=\"Golden%20Knight\"&gt;Golden Knight&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"Meridia\"&gt;Meridia&lt;/a&gt;, and the &lt;a href=\"Earl%20Leythen\"&gt;Earl&lt;/a&gt; of Mephala's Cult, a Champion, known as a &lt;a href=\"Vestige\"&gt;Nebarra&lt;/a&gt; by the people had climbed the Crystal Tower, slaying the Earl of Nocturnal and restoring Transparent Law with the newly-forged &lt;a href=\"Dawnbreaker\"&gt;Dawnbreaker&lt;/a&gt;. With the sword stricken into the crystal, Nocturnal was banished into Oblivion, and the Summerset Isles were saved. And so a new alliance was forged between the Psijic Order and the Sapiarchs, protecting the Crystal Tower and by extension Mundus from any other Daedric Invasion. Proxy Queen Alwinarwe continued her reign over Alinor, and the region brought newcomers into open arms. Razum-dar's investigation was over and so he returned to Queen Ayrenn with the information.\nThe Second Aldmeri Dominion &amp; The Siege of Alinor.\nAs time went on, the First Aldmeri Dominion created by Queen Ayrenn had dissolved, one way or the other, as did the other alliances in the Three-Banners War. &lt;a href=\"Clivia%20Tharn\"&gt;Clivia Tharn&lt;/a&gt;, who held the position of Empress-Regent in the &lt;a href=\"Imperial%20City\"&gt;Imperial City&lt;/a&gt; had fallen, and things continued as they did before the Alliance War. Many figures had taken and lost the &lt;a href=\"Ruby%20Throne\"&gt;Ruby Throne&lt;/a&gt;, but finally the tides were shifting when &lt;a href=\"Tiber%20Septim\"&gt;Tiber Septim&lt;/a&gt; united the province of Cyrodiil, under the banner of the &lt;a href=\"Septim%20Empire\"&gt;Septim Empire&lt;/a&gt;. Thus began the &lt;a href=\"Tiber%20Wars\"&gt;Tiber Wars&lt;/a&gt;, a series of conflicts that ultimately led to Septim's capture over the province, from the &lt;a href=\"Conquest%20of%20Hammerfell\"&gt;Conquest of Hammerfell&lt;/a&gt; to the Conquest in Morrowind, all that was left was the &lt;a href=\"Second%20Aldmeri%20Dominion\"&gt;Second Aldmeri Dominion&lt;/a&gt;. Before Tiber Septim's usurpation, the &lt;a href=\"Colovian%20Estates\"&gt;Colovian Estates&lt;/a&gt; waged war with the Wood Elves of Valenwood under the reign of the &lt;a href=\"Camoran%20Dynasty\"&gt;Camoran Dynasty&lt;/a&gt;. With the help of the &lt;a href=\"Thalmor\"&gt;Thalmor&lt;/a&gt; on Summerset, on behalf of their claimant, &lt;a href=\"Camoran%20Anaxemes\"&gt;Camoran Anaxemes&lt;/a&gt;, they were able to push back the Colovians out of Valenwood and establish peace in the province. Camoran Anaxemes pledged allegiance to the King of Alinor, establishing the Second Aldmeri Dominion.\nAs time went on, the Septim Empire fought battles between the Second Aldmeri Dominion, who were each equal in power. Their battles took place primarily throughout the &lt;a href=\"Abecean%20Sea\"&gt;Abecean Sea&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Colovian%20West\"&gt;Colovian West&lt;/a&gt;, with the Septims using &lt;a href=\"Stros%20M%27Kai\"&gt;Stros M'Kai&lt;/a&gt; as their bulwark for Dominion waters. Eventually, the battlefront pushed towards the Dominion Territory. But the conflict was officially declared over when Tiber Septim had utilized a gift from &lt;a href=\"Vivec\"&gt;Vivec&lt;/a&gt;, the Warrior-Poet himself. It would have been over had the King of Alinor agreed to peace with &lt;a href=\"Zurin%20Arctus\"&gt;Zurin Arctus&lt;/a&gt;, who had appeared before them in Alinor. Tiber Septim had activated &lt;a href=\"Numidium\"&gt;Numidium&lt;/a&gt;, the Brass-God of the Dwemer near the city-state of &lt;a href=\"Rimmen\"&gt;Rimmen&lt;/a&gt;, to which it advanced into their homelands. Tiber Septim had already tested the Numidium at &lt;a href=\"the%20Halls%20of%20Colossus\"&gt;the Halls of Colossus&lt;/a&gt; and had used the &lt;a href=\"Heart%20of%20Lorkhan\"&gt;Heart of Lorkhan&lt;/a&gt; to jumpstart the golem. The Summerset Isles were not ready for Numidium's divine power and were ultimately devastated by the attack. Numidium's siege was \"over\" when the Brass-God had reached the walls of Alinor and besieged the great city. The Aldmeri Dominion had been completely defeated, thus ushering a new epoch in time, onwards into the &lt;a href=\"Third%20Era\"&gt;Third Era&lt;/a&gt; and the blossoming Third Empire. But after this, the Brass-God Numidium was destroyed by the &lt;a href=\"Underking\"&gt;Underking&lt;/a&gt;, becoming lost to time, or so it &lt;a href=\"Warp%20in%20the%20West\"&gt;did&lt;/a&gt;.\n&lt;a href=\"Third%20Era\"&gt;Third Era&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe Aldmeri-Septim Alliance; the War of the Isle.\nFor many years, &lt;a href=\"King%20Orgnum\"&gt;King Orgnum&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"Pyandonea\"&gt;Pyandonea&lt;/a&gt; attempted to invade Summerset for many years, well before the Interregnum. Orgnum's latest attack was in &lt;a href=\"3E%20110\"&gt;3E 110&lt;/a&gt; with the &lt;a href=\"War%20of%20the%20Isle\"&gt;War of the Isle&lt;/a&gt;, which had started through the manipulation of &lt;a href=\"Potema%20Septim\"&gt;Potema Septim&lt;/a&gt;, who hails from the &lt;a href=\"Kingdom%20of%20Solitude\"&gt;Kingdom of Solitude&lt;/a&gt;. King Orgnum had met with Potema Septim, in regards of Orgnum's planned invasion of Tamriel, but the Psijic Order intervened. When King Orgnum's fleet crossed the &lt;a href=\"Sea%20of%20Pearls\"&gt;Sea of Pearls&lt;/a&gt;, they were met with the combined forces of Summerset's Armada and the &lt;a href=\"Imperial%20Navy\"&gt;Imperial Navy&lt;/a&gt; under the command of &lt;a href=\"Emperor%20Antiochus\"&gt;Emperor Antiochus&lt;/a&gt;. This was Orgnum's closest attempt to capturing the Summerset Isles, as Antiochus' Navy was shoddy at best. But with the help of the Psijic Order, the &lt;a href=\"Pyandonea\"&gt;Pyandonea&lt;/a&gt;n Armada was obliterated via a freakish storm conjured from the island of &lt;a href=\"Artaeum\"&gt;Artaeum&lt;/a&gt;. Potema intended for that in the hypothetical situation where Orgnum conquered Tamriel, then she would be proclaimed &lt;a href=\"Empress\"&gt;Empress&lt;/a&gt;, but it had failed. This would not be the last time she would attempt to take the Ruby Throne. But out of this conflict came the &lt;a href=\"Knights%20of%20the%20Nine%20%28Faction%29\"&gt;Knights of the Nine&lt;/a&gt;, a knightly order dedicated to the &lt;a href=\"Nine%20Divines\"&gt;Nine Divines&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href=\"Sir%20Amiel%20Lannus\"&gt;Sir Amiel Lannus&lt;/a&gt; was a veteran of the war, as where the other members.\nSummerset Isle during the Imperial Simulacrum.\nDuring the &lt;a href=\"Imperial%20Simulacrum\"&gt;Imperial Simulacrum&lt;/a&gt; from &lt;a href=\"3E%20389\"&gt;3E 389&lt;/a&gt; to &lt;a href=\"3E%20399\"&gt;3E 399&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"Imperial\"&gt;Imperial&lt;/a&gt; Battlemage named &lt;a href=\"Jagar%20Tharn\"&gt;Jagar Tharn&lt;/a&gt; impersonated Emperor &lt;a href=\"Uriel%20Septim%20VII\"&gt;Uriel Septim VII&lt;/a&gt; and casted both him and &lt;a href=\"Talin%20Warhaft\"&gt;Talin Warhaft&lt;/a&gt; into the &lt;a href=\"Deadlands\"&gt;Deadlands&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Mehrunes%20Dagon\"&gt;Mehrunes Dagon&lt;/a&gt;'s plane of &lt;a href=\"Oblivion%20%28Realm%29\"&gt;Oblivion&lt;/a&gt;. Jagar Tharn had a strong staff called the &lt;a href=\"Staff%20of%20Chaos\"&gt;Staff of Chaos&lt;/a&gt; which was the key to releasing Uriel and Warhaft from the Deadlands. To secure his control, he broke the Staff of Chaos into several pieces and hid them across the provinces in Tamriel. Tharn's apprentice, &lt;a href=\"Ria%20Silmane\"&gt;Ria Silmane&lt;/a&gt; caught wind of this and planned to tell the &lt;a href=\"Elder%20Council\"&gt;Elder Council&lt;/a&gt;, however, Tharn killed her with his vile magic. Ria Silmane's spirit sought the aid of a warrior also kept imprisoned by Tharn. Silmane help the warrior escaped and tasked them with finding the pieces of the Staff of Chaos throughout Tamriel. At one point, this warrior traveled to the cities of Alinor and Dusk, among others during their quest to gather the pieces. The warrior defeat Jagar Tharn at the &lt;a href=\"Imperial%20Palace\"&gt;Imperial Palace&lt;/a&gt; and freed both Uriel VII and Talin Warhaft, this young warrior was named the &lt;a href=\"Eternal%20Champion\"&gt;Eternal Champion&lt;/a&gt;. The Isle of Summerset had many settlements dotting the landscape or at least the general area. Smaller townships such as &lt;a href=\"Graddun%20Spring\"&gt;Graddun Spring&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Karndar%20Watch\"&gt;Karndar Watch&lt;/a&gt; existed in the area.\nThe Eternal Champion reached the city of Lillandril on their quest to find the fifth piece of the Staff. Through the visions of &lt;a href=\"Ria%20Silmane\"&gt;Ria Silmane&lt;/a&gt; and rumors from the people, the Champion had traveled to the northern coast, to the city of Lillandril in the province of the Summerset Isles. There the traveler ventured to the local &lt;a href=\"Mages%20Guild\"&gt;Mages Guild&lt;/a&gt; where they met &lt;a href=\"Corim%20Ashlen\"&gt;Corim Ashlen&lt;/a&gt;, the guildmaster of the local chapter. Ashlen gives the Eternal Champion a proposition where if they retrieved a diamond taken by a cult to the &lt;a href=\"Temple%20of%20the%20Mad%20God%20%28Location%29\"&gt;Temple of the Mad God&lt;/a&gt;, then he would reveal the location of the piece. After bringing the tablet and defeating the cultists, Ashlen showed the way to the &lt;a href=\"Crystal%20Tower\"&gt;Crystal Tower&lt;/a&gt;, a large tower that overlooks the province. It was there that the Eternal Champion had obtained the fifth piece of the staff. The Champion had moved on to find the sixth piece of the staff somewhere in Tamriel.\nThe Youthful Revolution; the Lighter and Darker Sides.\nIn the waning years of the Third Era, the High Elves have looked back on their past, taking a critical look at what makes, thinking to re-invent the meaning to it. The War of the Isle had left the youthful High Elves with this thought, and so they have taken upon themselves to make a change to the xenophobic and superiority that the Altmer has expressed for many years. A more constructive form of this movement was the acceptance of foreign races and cultures, more notably the rise of &lt;a href=\"Queen%20Morgiah\"&gt;Queen Morgiah&lt;/a&gt;, who rules alongside &lt;a href=\"Reman%20Karoodil\"&gt;Reman Karoodil&lt;/a&gt; in the city-state of &lt;a href=\"Firsthold\"&gt;Firsthold&lt;/a&gt;. Their children at considered the true heirs of that throne. But the movement had taken a more darker and violent method of bringing their message across. A group known as &lt;a href=\"the%20Beautiful\"&gt;the Beautiful&lt;/a&gt; had appeared throughout Summerset, vandalizing and destroying the greatest monuments on the Isles. The Crystal Tower was one of the original targets of the Beautiful, though the various attempts failed. The sculptures and emblems were vandalized. But the group took to more extreme methods; one such was the assassination of the Princess of &lt;a href=\"Shimmerene\"&gt;Shimmerene&lt;/a&gt;, which was considered both gruesome and outrageous towards the public. Summerset had grown dangerous, but another threat of immeasurable aptitudes would arrive shortly.\n&lt;a href=\"Fourth%20Era\"&gt;Fourth Era&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe Great Anguish over Summerset; Rising Threat.\nIn &lt;a href=\"3E%20433\"&gt;3E 433&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Uriel%20Septim%20VII\"&gt;Uriel Septim VII&lt;/a&gt; was assassinated within the sewers of the Imperial City by the &lt;a href=\"Mythic%20Dawn\"&gt;Mythic Dawn&lt;/a&gt; cult, worshippers of &lt;a href=\"Mehrunes%20Dagon\"&gt;Mehrunes Dagon&lt;/a&gt;. With him or his heirs, the &lt;a href=\"Dragonfires\"&gt;Dragonfires&lt;/a&gt; were unlit and the barrier separating Nirn, and Oblivion disappeared. Mehrunes Dagon had once again invaded Tamriel, beginning the &lt;a href=\"Oblivion%20Crisis\"&gt;Oblivion Crisis&lt;/a&gt;, known as the Great Anguish in Summerset. Many settlements, including &lt;a href=\"Sunhold\"&gt;Sunhold&lt;/a&gt; were besieged by the &lt;a href=\"Daedra\"&gt;Daedra&lt;/a&gt;, and many refugees had escaped for the &lt;a href=\"Crystal%20Tower\"&gt;Crystal Tower&lt;/a&gt;. Many of them believed that the Daedra would never invade Crystal-Like-Law, but instead, the Siege of the Tower was one of the bloodiest battles of the Crisis. The wizards protecting the Tower were scorching the Daedra in waves, but it ultimately proved in vain, as the Daedra overran the Crystal Tower. The Summerset Isles had fallen, and many refugees fled for Cyrodiil, where &lt;a href=\"Martin%20Septim\"&gt;Martin Septim&lt;/a&gt; had sacrificed himself to banish Mehrunes Dagon and forever seal the barrier. While Cyrodiil was celebrating Martin's sacrifice, the &lt;a href=\"Thalmor\"&gt;Thalmor&lt;/a&gt; themselves, claim that they ended the Crisis. The Thalmor had used this, to rally the people to their call amidst the ruined Empire. The Thalmor had become a rising threat, of which the continent has yet to have seen.\nIn &lt;a href=\"4E%2022\"&gt;4E 22&lt;/a&gt;, the Thalmor had garnered complete control over the Summerset Isles, becoming oppressive and ruthless as time went on. One of their more controversial moves was exiling &lt;a href=\"Rynandor%20the%20Bold\"&gt;Rynandor the Bold&lt;/a&gt;, who had helped many Altmeri refugees escape the Crystal Tower from the Daedra. The Thalmor went on to besmirch Rynandor's reputation to the mud until he was ultimately forced out of Summerset. On the mainland, the Altmeri refugee, &lt;a href=\"Lathenil%20of%20Sunhold\"&gt;Lathenil of Sunhold&lt;/a&gt; would preach against the rising Thalmor threat, forming a group against the Thalmor's advancements. Eventually, the Thalmor had decided to rename the entire province, naming it \"Alinor\", after the city-state that serves as the seat of power. In &lt;a href=\"4E%2029\"&gt;4E 29&lt;/a&gt;, the Wood Elves of Valenwood were brought in, to join the Thalmor and creating the &lt;a href=\"Third%20Aldmeri%20Dominion\"&gt;Third Aldmeri Dominion&lt;/a&gt;. The Third Aldmeri Dominion had grown into a force to be reckoned with, as &lt;a href=\"Potentate%20Ocato\"&gt;Potentate Ocato&lt;/a&gt; was assassinated and the &lt;a href=\"Mede%20Dynasty\"&gt;Mede Dynasty&lt;/a&gt; took over something later. Agents of &lt;a href=\"the%20Blades\"&gt;the Blades&lt;/a&gt; located in Dominion Regions were killed and brought to &lt;a href=\"Titus%20Mede%20II\"&gt;Titus Mede II&lt;/a&gt;, as a threat of impending war. On the 30th of &lt;a href=\"Frostfall\"&gt;Frostfall&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"4E%20171\"&gt;4E 171&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"Great%20War\"&gt;Great War&lt;/a&gt; had begun, between the Dominion and the Empire."}

He re-established its headquarters in &lt;a href=\"Fort%20Dawnguard\"&gt;Fort Dawnguard&lt;/a&gt;, a massive fortress deep within the &lt;a href=\"Velothi%20Mountains\"&gt;Velothi Mountains&lt;/a&gt; and rallied new recruits in order to combat the &lt;a href=\"Undead%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;undead&lt;/a&gt; menace.\nPersonality.\nIsran has a strong sense of righteousness and in addition believes it is his duty to protect Skyrim from vampires. However, he\u00a0tends to prioritize killing vampires over most other things, and would even put the lives of innocents at stake in order to aid his cause.\u00a0Even though he is not from &lt;a href=\"Skyrim\"&gt;Skyrim&lt;/a&gt;, he is proud to live there as heard through his battle cries. Despite no longer being a Vigilant, he still believes in Stendarr. He has quite a cold demeanor initially, perhaps the only trait he shares with his counterpart, &lt;a href=\"Harkon\"&gt;Harkon&lt;/a&gt;. His unfriendliness goes to new extremes when &lt;a href=\"Serana\"&gt;Serana&lt;/a&gt; is among the Dawnguard; he talks to her in harsh tones and constantly refers to her as 'it', even to her face. However, towards the end of the main questline, Isran refers to Serana by her name, rather than 'it', and goes as far to thank her for helping kill Harkon. According to him, his hatred of vampires is what keeps him strong; that, and constant vigilance. Compared to &lt;a href=\"Gunmar\"&gt;Gunmar&lt;/a&gt; who also lost his family to vampires, his drive to purge the land of vampires is not out of protecting people from the vampire menace but out of pure hate. Despite these negative traits, he is still compassionate and forgiving, as he did not gloat\u00a0about his\u00a0dire predictions coming true to Vigilant Tolan.\nHe is so tense and alert that he belittles the Dragonborn for sleeping, claiming it to be a weakness. The Dawnguard's leader is perfectly content expecting the worst to happen. However, while others mocked him, he read the signs and was able to take the right measures.\nIsran apparently has a consistent habit of falling-out with people and holding grudges. The &lt;a href=\"Vigilants%20of%20Stendarr\"&gt;Vigil&lt;/a&gt; let him go after he proved too \"extreme.\" Celann explains that he was never happy with Isran's rough and violent methods, and broke off their partnership. &lt;a href=\"Florentius%20Baenius\"&gt;Florentius&lt;/a&gt;, the priest of Arkay, never got on with him either. However, Isran is not so petty as to stay mad at people in times of need. To the surprise of his old colleagues, he recruits them to help the Dawnguard. In his own gruff manner, he continued to care for these people too. Upon hearing of &lt;a href=\"Keeper%20Carcette\"&gt;Keeper Carcette&lt;/a&gt; and the other Vigilants' deaths, he shows sorrow and compassion for their losses. If anything, it gives him more fuel for his obsession: to exterminate all Vampires.\nHe makes this more clear if the Dragonborn returns to Fort Dawnguard after either contracting &lt;a href=\"Vampirism%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;vampirism&lt;/a&gt; or becoming a &lt;a href=\"Vampire%20Lord\"&gt;Vampire Lord&lt;/a&gt;, angered that the Dragonborn has become one of them and directs them to &lt;a href=\"Morthal%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Morthal&lt;/a&gt; to seek a &lt;a href=\"Rising%20at%20Dawn\"&gt;cure&lt;/a&gt; from &lt;a href=\"Falion%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Falion&lt;/a&gt;, stating that until the Dragonborn does that, he will not allow them to remain in Fort Dawnguard, saying \"How dare you come back here after being infected by one of them.\" and \"Get out of here, monster.\"\nCombat.\nIsran is a formidable opponent, more than capable of spearheading an assault on vampires. He wields a &lt;a href=\"Dawnguard%20warhammer\"&gt;Dawnguard warhammer&lt;/a&gt;\u00a0with lethal force, especially deadly to Vampires. He uses the Dawnguard-exclusive spell &lt;a href=\"Stendarr%27s%20Aura\"&gt;Stendarr's Aura&lt;/a&gt;.\nInteractions.\n&lt;a href=\"Dawnguard%20%28Quest%29\"&gt;Dawnguard&lt;/a&gt;.\nAfter hearing about an order of vampire hunters who are recruiting, the Dragonborn goes to join them at &lt;a href=\"Fort%20Dawnguard\"&gt;Fort Dawnguard&lt;/a&gt;. Isran and Celann meet both the Dragonborn and &lt;a href=\"Agmaer\"&gt;Agmaer&lt;/a&gt; and induct them into the group.\n&lt;a href=\"Awakening%20%28Dawnguard%29\"&gt;Awakening&lt;/a&gt;.\nAfter a plea from &lt;a href=\"Tolan\"&gt;Tolan&lt;/a&gt;, Isran sends the Dragonborn to investigate what the vampires who attacked the &lt;a href=\"Hall%20of%20the%20Vigilant\"&gt;Hall of the Vigilant&lt;/a&gt; were looking for within &lt;a href=\"Dimhollow%20Crypt\"&gt;Dimhollow Crypt&lt;/a&gt;, which was just up the mountain from the Hall of the Vigilant.\n&lt;a href=\"A%20New%20Order\"&gt;A New Order&lt;/a&gt;.\nFurious at the Dragonborn's compassion to Serana and delivering an Elder Scroll to the Vampires, Isran orders the Dragonborn to make amends and recruit two of his old colleagues to their cause: &lt;a href=\"Sorine%20Jurard\"&gt;Sorine Jurard&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Gunmar\"&gt;Gunmar&lt;/a&gt;. When they return to Fort Dawnguard, Isran checks to make sure they haven't contracted &lt;a href=\"Sanguinare%20Vampiris\"&gt;Sanguinare Vampiris&lt;/a&gt;, then lets them into the fort to begin their work with strengthening the Dawnguard for future battles with the Vampires.\n&lt;a href=\"Prophet%20%28Dawnguard%29\"&gt;Prophet&lt;/a&gt;.\nIsran brings the player to reunite with Serana, who has fled from her father, Harkon. While disgusted at her presence, Isran is interested to hear about a Moth Priest in Skyrim and could help them understand the Tyranny of the Sun that Serana mentions. He sends the Dragonborn to retrieve &lt;a href=\"Dexion%20Evicus\"&gt;Dexion Evicus&lt;/a&gt; to help read Serana's Scroll and see if it provides any details that could aid the Dawnguard against Harkon.\n&lt;a href=\"Kindred%20Judgment\"&gt;Kindred Judgment&lt;/a&gt;.\nAfter the Dragonborn retrieves &lt;a href=\"Auriel%27s%20Bow%20%28Dawnguard%29\"&gt;Auriel's Bow&lt;/a&gt;, leaving him amazed that they have the object that Lord Harkon seeks to complete the &lt;a href=\"Tyranny%20of%20the%20Sun\"&gt;Tyranny of the Sun&lt;/a&gt; prophecy, Isran rallies the Dawnguard to prepare for the final assault against Harkon and his court at &lt;a href=\"Castle%20Volkihar\"&gt;Castle Volkihar&lt;/a&gt;, taking &lt;a href=\"Sorine%20Jurard\"&gt;Sorine Jurard&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Durak\"&gt;Durak&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Florentius%20Baenius\"&gt;Florentius Baenius&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Gunmar\"&gt;Gunmar&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Celann\"&gt;Celann&lt;/a&gt;, and an &lt;a href=\"Armored%20Troll\"&gt;Armored Troll&lt;/a&gt; with him to the castle. Once joined by the Dragonborn and Serana, they attack the castle and eliminate all of Harkon's court members, including his two Death Hounds, &lt;a href=\"Garmr\"&gt;Garmr&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"CuSith\"&gt;CuSith&lt;/a&gt;, leaving Serana and the Dragonborn to face Harkon alone. After Harkon is slain, Isran thanks Serana for her help, showing newfound respect for Harkon's daughter. He offers the Dragonborn a chance to return to &lt;a href=\"Fort%20Dawnguard\"&gt;Fort Dawnguard&lt;/a&gt; to continue working with the Dawnguard to weed out other vampires around Skyrim, knowing that Auriel's Bow is in good hands.\n&lt;a href=\"Destroying%20the%20Dawnguard\"&gt;Destroying the Dawnguard&lt;/a&gt;.\nHe and the others members in Fort Dawnguard are targets for this vampire side quest with eliminating them to ensure the Dawnguard won't be a threat to Harkon's court any longer.\n&lt;a href=\"A%20Jarl%27s%20Justice\"&gt;A Jarl's Justice&lt;/a&gt;.\nIsran requires help dealing with a vampire masquerading as a &lt;a href=\"Visiting%20Advisor\"&gt;Visiting Advisor&lt;/a&gt; to a &lt;a href=\"Jarl\"&gt;Jarl&lt;/a&gt;.\nConversations.\nIsran: \"You there, boy. Stop skulking in the shadows and step up here. What's your name?\"\n&lt;a href=\"Agmaer\"&gt;Agmaer&lt;/a&gt;: \"I'm, uh... my name is Agmaer, sir.\"\nIsran: \"\"Do I look like a \"sir\" to you, boy? I'm not a soldier, and you're not joining the army.\"\"\nAgmaer: \"Yes, si... Isran.\"\nIsran: \"Didn't I tell you to step forward? Hmm... Farm boy, eh? What's your weapon?\"\nAgmaer: \"Uh, my weapon? I mostly just use my pa's axe, when wolves are attacking the goats or something.\"\nIsran: \"\"\"My pa's axe\", Stendarr preserve us. Don't worry, I think we can make a Dawnguard out of you. Here, take this crossbow and let's see how you shoot.\"\"\nAgmaer: \"Uh, crossbow? I've never...\"\nIsran: \"Yes, a crossbow. Best thing for killing vampires. Just take a few shots at those crates over there. Watch the recoil. Takes some getting used to. That's it. Take a deep breath and let it out as you fire. You'll get the hang of it. You need to concentrate, boy. Try it again.\"\nIsran: \"\"Why are you here, &lt;a href=\"Vigilant%20Tolan\"&gt;Tolan&lt;/a&gt;? The Vigilants and I were finished with each other a long time ago.\"\"\nTolan: \"You know why I'm here. The Vigilants are under attack everywhere. The vampires are much more dangerous than we believed.\"\nIsran: \"And now you want to come running to safety with the Dawnguard, is that it? I remember Keeper Carcette telling me repeatedly that Fort Dawnguard is a crumbling ruin, not worth the expense and manpower to repair. And now that you've stirred up the vampires against you, you come begging for my pardon?\"\nTolan: \"Isran, Carcette is dead. The Hall of the Vigilants... everyone... they're all dead. You were right, we were wrong. Isn't that enough for you?\"\nIsran: \"Yes, well... I never wanted any of this to happen. I tried to warn all of you... I am sorry, you know.\"\nAbout &lt;a href=\"Dimhollow%20Crypt\"&gt;Dimhollow Crypt&lt;/a&gt;:\nIsran: \"Tolan, tell him about, what was it, Dimhollow?\"\nTolan: \"Yes, that's it. Dimhollow Crypt. Brother Adalvald was sure it held some long lost vampire artifact of some kind. We didn't listen to him any more than we did Isran. He was at the Hall when it was attacked...\"\nIsran: \"That's good enough for me. Go see what the vampires were looking for in this Dimhollow Crypt. With any luck, they'll still be there. Feel free to poke around the fort and take what you need. There isn't much yet, but you're welcome to anything you can use.\"\nTolan: \"I'll meet you at Dimhollow. It's the least I can do to avenge my fallen comrades.\"\nIsran: \"Tolan, I don't think that's a good idea. You Vigilants were never trained for...\"\nTolan: \"I know what you think of us. You think we're soft, that we're cowards. You think our deaths proved our weakness. Stendarr grant that you do not have to face the same test and be found wanting. I'm going to Dimhollow Crypt. Perhaps I can be of some small assistance to you.\"\nGunmar: \"All right Isran, you've got us all here. Now what do you want?\"\nIsran: \"Hold it right there.\"\nSorine: \"What are you doing?\"\nIsran: \"Making sure you're not vampires. Can't be too careful. So, welcome to Fort Dawnguard. I'm sure you've heard a bit of what we're up against. Powerful vampires, unlike anything we've seen before. And they have an Elder Scroll. If anyone is going to stand in their way, it's going to be us.\"\nSorine: \"This is all well and good, but do we actually know anything about what they're doing? What do we do now?\"\nIsran: \"We'll get to that. For now, get acquainted with the space. Sorine, you'll find room to start your tinkering on that crossbow design you've been working on. Gunmar, there's an area large enough for you to pen up some trolls, get them armored up and ready for use. In the meantime, we're going to get to the bottom of why a vampire showed up here looking for . Let's go have a little chat with it, shall we?\"\nIsran: \"\"This vampire showed up while you were away. I'm guessing it's the one you found in Dimhollow Crypt. Says it's got something really important to say to you. So let's hear it.\"\n[After talking with &lt;a href=\"Serana\"&gt;Serana&lt;/a&gt; and Isran]\nIsran: \"You hear me? Don't feel like a guest, because you're not. You're a resource. You're an asset. In the meantime, don't make me regert my sudden outburst of tolerance and generosity, because if you do, your friend here is going to pay for it.\"\nSerana: \"\"Thank you for your kindness. I'll remember it the next time I'm feeling hungry.\"\n[After talking with Serana again]\nIsran: \"Some Imperial scholar arrived in Skyrim a few days ago. I was staking out the road when I saw him pass by. Maybe that's your Moth Priest.\"\nSerana: \"Do you know where he's staying now?\"\nIsran: \"No, and I'm not going to waste men looking. We're fighting a war against your kind, and I intend to win it. You want to find him, try talking to anyone who'd meet a traveler. Innkeepers and carriage drivers in the big cities maybe. But you're on your own.\"\nIsran: \"Everyone! Gather 'round! Come on then, we haven't got all day! For too long we've allowed these vampires to poison the night and kill our people! Now, we finally have the means to strike back! We now have Auriel's Bow. The gods themselves have favored us and we must answer with action! The time has come to finally put an end to Harkon and his unholy prophecy! We will march on their lair and destroy those wretched abominations so they can no longer corrupt our world! This is our fight and this is our fate! This is the time of the Dawnguard!\"\nFlorentius: \"Burn them all!\"\nCelann: \"Kill the abominations!\"\nAgmaer: \"Victory to the Dawnguard!\"\nSorine: \"Give him a crossbow bolt between the eyes for me!\"\nBeleval: \"Send the troll after them!\"\nGunmar: \"Send them to Oblivion!\"\nFlorentius: \"Praise Arkay!\"\nDurak: \"The prophecy is no more!\"\nIsran: \"It's over. He's dead, and the prophecy dies with him. I... I suppose this is difficult for you.\"\nSerana: \"I think my father really died a long time ago. This was just... the end of something else. I did what needed to be done. Nothing more.\"\nIsran: \"I think perhaps... I think you did more than that. You have my thanks.\""}

Hakan would prove to be abusive to Iszara, and he was later killed by Cyrus, leaving Iszara a widow.

Hakan and Izsara soon fell in love and married later the same year. Izsara told Cyrus that Hakan was a wonderful husband, but at times he was often away busy with political matters or training with the &lt;a href=\"Forebears\"&gt;Forebears&lt;/a&gt;.\nIn &lt;a href=\"2E%20854\"&gt;2E 854&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Cyrus%20and%20Iszara%27s%20Father\"&gt;her father&lt;/a&gt; wrote a play in the night about the ancient &lt;a href=\"Ra%20Gada\"&gt;Ra Gada&lt;/a&gt; from &lt;a href=\"Yokuda\"&gt;Yokuda&lt;/a&gt; defeating the &lt;a href=\"Orsimer\"&gt;Orcs&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"Hammerfell\"&gt;Hammerfell&lt;/a&gt; to claim the land for their &lt;a href=\"High%20King\"&gt;High King&lt;/a&gt;. This play was an attempt to solve the conflict between the two factions. The play was a huge success, and a celebration party was held in a local tavern after it finished where both Crowns and Forebears attended in equal numbers.\nHakan was not impressed by this play, and in his drunken state, Hakan challenged the also drunken Cyrus in sword combat. Iszara pleaded Hakan to stop, to which he responded Iszara with a slap to the face. They fought and Cyrus emerged the victor, lunging a blow right in Hakan's chest. Following that event Cyrus ran away, leaving Iszara heartbroken.\nDisappearance.\nIn &lt;a href=\"2E%20864\"&gt;2E 864&lt;/a&gt;, Cyrus met with &lt;a href=\"S%27rathra\"&gt;S'rathra&lt;/a&gt; in\u00a0&lt;a href=\"Wayrest\"&gt;Wayrest&lt;/a&gt; where he is given a letter written by his old friend, &lt;a href=\"Tobias\"&gt;Tobias&lt;/a&gt;.

According to Mora, she had the ability to alter fate and shape destiny to her liking. Her existence was rediscovered by the &lt;a href=\"Vestige\"&gt;Vestige&lt;/a&gt; among others during the events following the &lt;a href=\"Planemeld\"&gt;Planemeld&lt;/a&gt;.\nBackground.\nDuring the &lt;a href=\"Merethic%20Era\"&gt;Merethic Era&lt;/a&gt;, Ithelia ruled over the realm of &lt;a href=\"Mirrormoor\"&gt;Mirrormoor&lt;/a&gt; with the power to unmake and remake reality, and was worshipped by the &lt;a href=\"Ayleid\"&gt;Ayleid&lt;/a&gt;s of &lt;a href=\"Essondul\"&gt;Essondul&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Elenglynn\"&gt;Elenglynn&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Miscarcand\"&gt;Miscarcand&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Cyrodiil\"&gt;Cyrodiil&lt;/a&gt;. Sometime before &lt;a href=\"2E%20582\"&gt;2E 582&lt;/a&gt;, Hermaeus Mora became convinced that Ithelia's power was far too dangerous for all reality. He was able to convince most of the other princes to aid him, although others, including &lt;a href=\"Vaermina\"&gt;Vaermina&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Peryite\"&gt;Peryite&lt;/a&gt;, refused. Despite opposition, Mora succeeded in erasing the memory of Ithelia from the minds of all others, but was unable to remove his own memories. To safeguard them, Mora contained his memories of Ithelia and her erasure inside three &lt;a href=\"primordial%20glyphics\"&gt;primordial glyphics&lt;/a&gt;. The erasure of all memories of Ithelia resulted in her being trapped in Apocrypha.\nSometime following Ithelia's imprisonment, the &lt;a href=\"Dremora\"&gt;Dremora&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Torvesard\"&gt;Torvesard&lt;/a&gt; began experiencing dreams, an unheard-of phenomenon for a Dremora. In 2E 582, he formed an alliance with the princes Vaermina and Peryite who also had a faint recollection of the events in Torvesard's dream. The three Daedra worked together against Hermaeus Mora to restore the memories they believed had been stolen from them and, during an attack against Mora's realm of &lt;a href=\"Apocrypha\"&gt;Apocrypha&lt;/a&gt;, Torvesard was able to access two of the three glyphics, restoring many of his memories of Ithelia. Mora describes Torvesard as Ithelia's \"contingency plan\" and \"her revenge.\" It was revealed that Torvesard was a member of the Unseen, the agents of Ithelia who had evaded Mora for centuries. Torvesard began working to free his Prince from captivity.\nUpon regaining her own memories, Ithelia arrived in &lt;a href=\"Fargrave\"&gt;Fargrave&lt;/a&gt;, what used to be her realm of Mirrormoor, and sought to use the &lt;a href=\"Loom%20of%20the%20Untraveled%20Road\"&gt;Loom of the Untraveled Road&lt;/a&gt; to restore her realm to its original glory. But when she realized that it was not possible and after the Vestige destroyed the loom, she unknowingly let her powers take over her mind and she vowed to rebuild Mirrormoor over the ruins of Apocrypha. She attacked her rival Hermaeus Mora and drained some of his power in an attempt to destroy him. However, the Vestige utilized a Daedric artefact to show Ithelia what she had become. Realising what she was doing, Ithelia renounced her power and position as a Daedric Prince and restored Mora's stolen power. Due to the fact that her powers would return regardless if she renounced them or not, she collaborated with Hermaeus Mora to open a pathway to a reality where magic did not exist, ensuring that she could never use her powers again. The Vestige used &lt;a href=\"Abolisher\"&gt;Abolisher&lt;/a&gt;, a Daedric artifact of &lt;a href=\"Boethiah%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Boethia&lt;/a&gt; to sever said reality from all others, preventing her escape. In order to prevent anymore destruction, Hermaeus Mora once again erased all memories of Ithelia from the &lt;a href=\"Aurbis\"&gt;Aurbis&lt;/a&gt;. Mora retained his own memories of Ithelia without the use of primordial glyphics and also allowed the Vestige to retain their memories of her."}

As The story unfolds, animal after animal is killed and prepared for a big meal. Lastly the farmer comes to the ox and prepares to slit its throat. The ox, not wishing to be anybody's dinner, prayed very vocally (in the form of a moo) to Ius. Then, Ius appeared carrying a rather large set of balance weights and, without explanation, ate the farmer and vanished. Ever since that day, Ius has always been portrayed as carrying a large set of scales with him. Local Ius worshipers are said to neither know nor care about the scales' reason.\nSecond Myth.\nOf validity unknown, this myth states that, before the age of &lt;a href=\"Pelagius%20Septim%20III\"&gt;Pelagius Septim III&lt;/a&gt;, there lived a wombat who was the pet of Lady Greelina (daughter of the Lord Prufrock of Rockcreek). Greelina and her wombat loved one another, but it was a time of great sorrow in Rockcreek. A pestilence had come through the town, destroying all their cash crops (which consisted of raspberries and \"odd weeds\"). The plague had come, inflicting nearly every cobbler with chronic \"hiccoughs\"; finally a witch had cursed the townspeople so the only words any could utter were \"Hmmm. Precisely.\" All the businesses, stores, and guilds fled from the town.\nLady Greelina saw her father despairing the loss the town was suffering, so she brought her wombat in and told him, \"Father, my wombat can save us all, for it is sacred to the god Ius, God of Animals. The only reason I didn't tell you earlier is because I am an early adolescent going through that period when I don't like to communicate. But please, ask a wish of my wombat, and Ius will fulfill it, for my wombat loves me.\" The king thought this was fairly flakey, but had nothing to lose, so he uttered a modest wish to the wombat: \"All I want is for one business to come to Rockcreek that will never leave no matter the calamity.\"\nDue to years of abuse in the hands of the king (who used to lick it and try to make it stick to walls), the wombat had Ius create an equipment store in front of the palace gate that would never go away. The royal family ended up going mad and eating one another (and ironically, the wombat was one of the first to go). It is said that, to this day, an equipment store still blocks the palace gate in Rockcreek."}

It seems that one day an evil farmer decided to kill all of his animals and have a big party. As The story unfolds, animal after animal is killed and prepared for a big meal. Lastly the farmer comes to the ox and prepares to slit its throat. The ox, not wishing to be anybody's dinner, prayed very vocally to Ius.

Ever since that day Ius The Extremely Agitated, has always been portrayed as carrying a large set of scales with him. The local Ius worshippers have no idea why and do not seem to care. Although this story has been called fanciful at best, I personally know a racoon who had actually talked to The Ox. That is, before the Ox became filler for the local inn's larder.\nI do not have any information one way or the other about the validity of this second myth. It is, however, quite traditional.\nIt seems that many, many years ago, before the reign of &lt;a href=\"Uriel%20Septim%20VII\"&gt;Uriel Septim VII&lt;/a&gt;, before the reign of &lt;a href=\"Cephorus%20Septim%20II\"&gt;Cephorus Septim II&lt;/a&gt;, yes, even before the age of &lt;a href=\"Pelagius%20Septim%20III\"&gt;Pelagius Septim III&lt;/a&gt; (long may his name be praised!), there lived a wombat who was the pet of &lt;a href=\"Lady%20Greelina\"&gt;Lady Greelina&lt;/a&gt;, daughter of the Lord &lt;a href=\"Prufrock\"&gt;Prufrock&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"Rockcreek\"&gt;Rockcreek&lt;/a&gt;. Lady Greelina loved her wombat so, and it loved her too with all the passionate intensity a marsupial can muster.\nUnfortunately, it was a time of great sorrow in Rockcreek. A pestilence had come through the town, destroying all their cash crops (which consisted of raspberries and a few scraggly odd weeds that caused &lt;a href=\"Argonian\"&gt;Argonian&lt;/a&gt; women to look very attractive to those who partook); Then a plague had come, inflicting nearly every cobbler with chronic hiccoughs; finally a witch had cursed the townspeople so the only words any could utter were \"Hmmm. Precisely.\" All the businesses, stores, and guilds fled from the town faster than an extremely fast thing.\nLady Greelina saw her father despairing the loss the town was suffering, so she brought her wombat in and told him, \"Father, my wombat can save us all, for it is sacred to the god Ius, God of Animals. The only reason I didn't tell you earlier is because I am an early adolescent going through that period when I don't like to communicate.

The royal family ended up going mad and eating one another (and ironically, the wombat was one of the first to go). But that is why there is to this day an equipment store blocking the palace gate in Rockcreek. If you don't believe me, go there and see."}

The nobles of &lt;a href=\"Rivenspire\"&gt;Rivenspire&lt;/a&gt; have buried their departed beneath the gnarled trees here for as long as anyone alive today remembers, laying relatives to rest among centuries-old crypts that have borne witness to corruption, disputes, theft, and worse.\nMany prominent northern nobles inter their dead in Westmark's cold earth, including the &lt;a href=\"House%20Dorell\"&gt;Dorell&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"House%20Tamrith\"&gt;Tamrith&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"House%20Montclair\"&gt;Montclair&lt;/a&gt; families. Though some of these houses have produced Kings and Queens of &lt;a href=\"Shornhelm%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Shornhelm&lt;/a&gt;, those deceased do not rest with their relatives here. Instead, they are transported to join the other monarchs of High Rock in the great cemetery of &lt;a href=\"Cath%20Bedraud\"&gt;Cath Bedraud&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Glenumbra%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Glenumbra&lt;/a&gt;, per long-standing tradition.\nFeuds between the houses over the titles to gravesites in the Sanguine Barrows are common. One incident in Mid Year of &lt;a href=\"2E%20551\"&gt;2E 551&lt;/a&gt; earned the burial grounds their unfortunate common name. As I recall, it so happened that the Tamrith and Montclair houses both suffered the loss of a family member on the same day. The houses' claims in the barrows bordered one another and had been a source of strife between them for many years. When both funeral processions arrived one morning on the same hill in front of the same gravesite (a highly desirable one with a view of the river), conflict was inevitable.\nThe nobles quarreled for hours and sent servants back and forth for documents, titles, and maps with official claims laid out, but neither house could be convinced to step down. As sunset approached, patience was in short supply. The Montclairs and the Tamriths each blame the other, unsurprisingly, for hurling the insult that provoked the houses into drawing steel, and the &lt;a href=\"Bloody%20Funeral\"&gt;Bloody Funeral&lt;/a&gt; (as it came to be called) that ensued left a black mark on each house's legacy in the eyes of Rivenspire's people.\nLooting and desecration are likewise common among the Sanguine Barrows. Though the responsibility of patrolling them belongs to the constabulary of &lt;a href=\"Hoarfrost%20Downs\"&gt;Hoarfrost Downs&lt;/a&gt;, the lure of riches is sometimes enough to turn a protector into a criminal, or at least enough to turn his head and allow entry to the tombs. More than once, a King or Queen of Shornhelm has ordered a hanging to set an example against such behavior.\nDespite these harsh consequences, a new defacement or theft still seems to follow nearly every noble burial. In fact, it has only been a few years since the Tamriths were scandalized when an entire crypt was found empty one morning of everything\u2014bodies and all. The thieves were never found, and as to why they'd take the bodies with their loot, well, we'd all prefer not to think of it.\nThe Sanguine Barrows have seen more than their share of villainy and conflict throughout the years, and earned their name many times over. I sincerely hope that no more tales of violence or robbery shall need to be added to this record, and that the nobles still buried there may rest peacefully for ages to come."}

He made a fortune, first as a bandit and a raider, and later as a landowner and businessman. In all of his roles, he more than earned the name he was given\u2014Yoregg the Bastard. By all accounts, he relished the name, and even had it applied to his tomb when his long and vile life finally came to an end. This is the tale of how that came to be.\nYoregg the Bastard was among the oldest men in &lt;a href=\"Windhelm%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Windhelm&lt;/a&gt;, but he was as strong and as vigorous as anyone half his age. He owned many of the shops and market stalls in the city, as well as the tavern, the stables, and most of the farms beyond the western walls. But \"own\" might be too soft a word. Yoregg ruled over his holdings with as much power and authority as any thane or jarl in the land. If you worked for Yoregg, he treated you little better than a servant or a slave, and if you rented land from him, he made sure you acted as a humble vassal in his vaunted presence.\nIn other words, he was a pure and total bastard.\nWhile Yoregg continued to fortify his fortune and terrorize the people beholden to him, he also began work on his tomb. He chose a location far to the southeast, in the region where he made his first fortune as a bandit and a raider when he was a very young man. The old hide-out that he used as a headquarters in those days of pillaging and plunder was located within a series of caves in the mountains separating southern &lt;a href=\"Eastmarch%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Eastmarch&lt;/a&gt; from &lt;a href=\"The%20Rift%20%28Online%29\"&gt;the Rift&lt;/a&gt;. He hired the talented stoneworker, &lt;a href=\"Shreg%20Rock-Fingers\"&gt;Shreg Rock-Fingers&lt;/a&gt;, to turn the unadorned caves into a suitable resting place for the Bastard. She didn't disappoint.\nWhen Yoregg traveled to the tomb to see what Shreg had accomplished, he made one of the few blatant mistakes of his life. And it was a mistake that was about to cost him dearly. The truth was, Shreg had a grudge against the Bastard. Of course, almost everyone who had ever met the Bastard had a grudge or a grievance or an ax to grind with the intolerable man. But Shreg's grudge was personal and deep seated.\nYoregg had squeezed gold from Shreg's parents for decades while they toiled and worked the farm he rented to them. She remembered how they suffered, but rarely complained. How almost every coin they earned had to go to the Bastard to pay off their debt. But it was never enough. And when Mother fell sick, Shreg could only watch as Yoregg and his goons unceremoniously tossed her family from their land for failing to make their regular payments. On that day, Shreg swore she would find a way to make the Bastard suffer.\nYoregg was thrilled with the work Shreg had done on the tomb. It was regal and vast, and it appealed to his overblown sense of self-worth and status. He adored the raised dais and the altar that were the focal point of the main burial chamber, and the high ceiling above gave the place a majestic air that played to the Bastard's ego. \"Yes,\" he declared, \"this will do nicely.\"\nShreg led the old man to an open sarcophagus made of chisiled stone that stood upright against one wall. \"Would you care to step inside, my lord,\" Shreg asked as innocently as she could manage, \"so that I can take an accurate measure?\" Yoregg beamed. He couldn't wait to step inside the ornate stone casket. But Yoregg was still a big man, even at his advanced age, and the inside of the box was tight and snug.\n\"Squeeze in, my lord,\" Shreg said, shoving at one of Yoregg's broad shoulders. Finally, after a bit of a struggle and some judicious contortions by the old man, Shreg was able to swing the massive lid of the sarcophagus closed.\n\"How does it feel, my lord?\" Shreg asked sweetly.\n\"It's a bit cramped,\" Yoregg admitted. \"And very dark.\"\n\"Just like your soul, my lord,\" Shreg shouted, making sure he could hear her through the stone.\n\"Excuse me? What did you say?\" Yoregg demanded, his voice reflecting confusion and anger and a slight hint of blossoming fear.\n\"This is for my parents, you bastard,\" Shreg declared as she sealed the lid of the sarcophagus. \"Enjoy your eternal rest, my lord.\"\nShreg could hear the Bastard's cries echo through the chambers as she exited the tomb. She hoped it took him a long, long time to die."}

Countless archers line the ramparts on approach and barricades slow progress towards the gate. Once the barricades have been sundered, the Infantry can rush the courtyard and gain access to the walls.

Their tradition of passing tales from one person to another is beautiful, and I have a deep respect for it. However, the scholar in me finds it difficult to hold a story in my heart without writing it down. For me, writing it down is another form of caring for the story. The message does not change, but the action of putting the words to parchment affixes it to my heart in such a way that feels intimate. There is no one correct way to tell a story, of course. But I heard this story from a Reach &lt;a href=\"vateshran\"&gt;vateshran&lt;/a&gt; and it got its claws into me and would not let go until I put it to paper. I'd like to dedicate this copy to the vateshran himself. I do not expect him to learn to read it, nor would I ask him to. It is my token to him, a way to thank him for sharing the story with me by expressing it in my own way.\nPerhaps he will discard it, considering it outsider foolishness. But that's all right. I'm grateful to have heard this story at all.\nThe Battle of &lt;a href=\"Karthspire\"&gt;Karthspire&lt;/a&gt; Lea\nAs told to me by &lt;a href=\"Vateshran%20Barth\"&gt;Vateshran Barth&lt;/a&gt;\nIt was not so much a battle as it was a sea of blood. The &lt;a href=\"Six-Ford\"&gt;Six-Ford&lt;/a&gt; and Eagleseers did not fight, they merely bled. It is said that the grass of the lea was stained so thoroughly with red, it appeared black from a distance.\nThere was no clear victor. Unusual, for a conflict between the &lt;a href=\"Reachmen\"&gt;Reachfolk&lt;/a&gt;. Many battles have been fought with the kind of rage and intensity that this one was fought, but historically, one force always yields. It is the nature of combat. One party, no matter how enraged, weakens under pressure. Such was not the case with this battle. Neither side waned. They flung themselves at one another, ceaselessly crashing against each other like waves against a cliffside.\nThe men and women of each clan seemed to fight as if they intended to die. There was no thought of victory, only carnage.\nThe leader of the &lt;a href=\"Eagleseers\"&gt;Eagleseers&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Maddorfa\"&gt;Maddorfa&lt;/a&gt;, took a mortal wound very early in the battle. A spear lodged itself in his leg, rendering him unable to walk. He insisted those close to him bind him to a nearby pillar so that he need not stand in order to continue fighting. The battle became something darker than winning or losing. It was rage unhindered, unchecked, and about killing as many of the enemy as possible.\nFew Reachfolk walked away from Karthspire Lea that day."}

Here is what I can tell you.\nWhen the &lt;a href=\"Chimer\"&gt;Chimer&lt;/a&gt; first abandoned the herds and tents of their nomadic ancestors, and built the first &lt;a href=\"Great%20Houses\"&gt;Great Houses&lt;/a&gt;, we loved the &lt;a href=\"Daedra\"&gt;Daedra&lt;/a&gt;, and worshipped them as gods. But our brethren, the &lt;a href=\"Dwemer\"&gt;Dwemer&lt;/a&gt;, scorned the Daedra, and mocked our foolish rituals, and preferred instead their gods of Reason and Logic. So the Chimer and Dwemer were always at bitter war, until the &lt;a href=\"Nords\"&gt;Nords&lt;/a&gt; came and invaded &lt;a href=\"Resdayn\"&gt;Resdayn&lt;/a&gt;. Only then did the Chimer and Dwemer put away their strife and join together to cast out the invaders.\nOnce the Nords were driven out, &lt;a href=\"Indoril%20Nerevar\"&gt;General Nerevar&lt;/a&gt; of the Chimer and General Dumac of the Dwemer, who had come to love and respect one another, resolved to make peace between their peoples. In that time I was but a junior counselor to Nerevar, and Nerevar's queen, &lt;a href=\"Almalexia\"&gt;Almalexia&lt;/a&gt;, and his other favorite counselor, &lt;a href=\"Sotha%20Sil\"&gt;Sotha Sil&lt;/a&gt;, always doubted that such a peace might long survive, given the bitter disputes between Chimer and Dwemer, but by negotiation and compromise, Nerevar and Dumac somehow managed to preserve a fragile peace.\nBut when &lt;a href=\"Dagoth%20Ur%20%28Character%29\"&gt;Dagoth Ur&lt;/a&gt;, Lord of House Dagoth, and trusted as a friend by both Nerevar and the Dwemer, brought us proof that High Engineer &lt;a href=\"Kagrenac\"&gt;Kagrenac&lt;/a&gt; of the Dwemer had discovered the &lt;a href=\"Heart%20of%20Lorkhan\"&gt;Heart of Lorkhan&lt;/a&gt;, and that he had learned how to tap its powers, and was building a new god, a mockery of Chimer faith and a fearsome weapon, we all urged Nerevar to make war on the Dwarves and to destroy this threat to Chimer beliefs and security. Nerevar was troubled. He went to Dumac and asked if what Dagoth Ur said was true. But Kagrenac took great offense, and asked whom Nerevar thought he was, that he might presume to judge the affairs of the Dwemer.\nNerevar was further troubled, and made pilgrimage to &lt;a href=\"Holamayan\"&gt;Holamayan&lt;/a&gt;, the sacred temple of &lt;a href=\"Azura\"&gt;Azura&lt;/a&gt;, and Azura confirmed that all that Dagoth Ur said was indeed true and that the creation of a New God of the Dwemer should be prevented at all costs. When Nerevar came back and told us what the goddess had said, we felt our judgements confirmed, and again counseled him to war, chiding Nerevar for his naive trust in friendship, and reminding Nerevar of his duty to protect the faith and security of the Chimer against the impiety and dangerous ambitious of the Dwemer.\nThen Nerevar went back to &lt;a href=\"Vvardenfell\"&gt;Vvardenfell&lt;/a&gt; one last time, hoping that negotiations and compromise might once again preserve the peace. But this time the friends Nerevar and Dumac quarreled bitterly, and as a result, the Chimer and Dwemer went to war.\nThe Dwemer were well-defended by their fortress at Red Mountain, but Nerevar's cunning drew most of Dumac's armies out into the field and pinned them there, while Nerevar, Dagoth Ur, and a small group of companions could make their way into the Heart Chamber by secret means. There, Nerevar the Chimer King met Dumac the Dwarf King and they both collapsed from grievous wounds and draining magics. With Dumac fallen, and threatened by Dagoth Ur and others, Kagrenac turned his tools upon the Heart, and Nerevar said he saw Kagrenac and all his Dwemer companions at once disappear from the world. In that instant, Dwemer everywhere disappeared without a trace.\nBut &lt;a href=\"Kagrenac%27s%20Tools\"&gt;Kagrenac's Tools&lt;/a&gt; remained, and Dagoth Ur seized them, and he carried them to Nerevar saying, \"That fool Kagrenac has destroyed his own people with these things. We should destroy them, right away, lest they fall into the wrong hands.\"\nBut Nerevar was resolved to confer with his queen and his generals, who had foreseen that this war would come and whose counsel he would not ignore again. \"I will ask the Tribunal what we shall do with them, for they have had wisdom in the past that I had not. Stay here, loyal Dagoth Ur, until I return.\" So Nerevar told Dagoth Ur to protect the tools and the Heart Chamber until he returned.\nThen Nerevar was carried to us where we waited on the slopes of Red Mountain, and he told us all that had transpired under Red Mountain. What Nerevar had said was that the Dwemer had used special tools to turn their people into immortals and that the Heart of Lorkhan held wondrous powers. (Only later did we hear from others present that Dagoth Ur had thought the Dwemer destroyed, not made immortal. And no one knows for sure what really happened there).\nAfter hearing Nerevar, we gave our counsel as he requested, proposing, \"We should preserve these tools in trust for the welfare of the Chimer people. And who knows, perhaps the Dwemer are not gone forever, but merely transported to some distant realm, from which they may some day return to threaten our securtiy once again. Therefore, we need to keep these tools, to study them and their principles, so that we may be safe in future generations.\"\nAnd though Nerevar voiced his grave misgivings, he was willing to be ruled by our counsel, under one condition: that we all together should swear a solemn oath upon Azura that the tools would never be used in the profane manner that the Dwemer had intended. We all readily agreed, and swore solemn oaths at Nerevar's dictation.\nSo then we went with Nerevar back into Red Mountain and met with Dagoth Ur. Dagoth Ur refused to deliver the tools to us, saying they were dangerous, and we could not touch them. Dagoth Ur seemed to be irrational, insisting that only he could be trusted with the tools, and then we guessed that he had some how been affected by his handling of the tools, but now I feel sure that he had privately learned the powers of the tools, and had in some confused way decided he must have them for himself. Then Nerevar and our guard resorted to force to secure the tools. Somehow Dagoth Ur and his retainers escaped, but we gained the tools, and delivered them to Sotha Sil for study and safe-keeping.\nFor some years we kept the oaths we swore to Azura with Nerevar, but during that time, in secret, Sotha Sil must have studied the tools and divined their mysteries. And at last he came to us with a vision of a new world of peace, with justice and honor for nobles, and health and prosperity for the commoners, with the Tribunal as immortal patrons and guides. And dedicating ourselves to this vision of a better world, we made a pilgrimage to Red Mountain and transformed ouselves with the power of Kagrenac's tools.\nAnd no sooner than we had completed our rituals and begun to discover our new-found powers, the Daedra Lord Azura appeared and cursed us for our foresworn oaths. By her powers of prophecy, she assured us that her champion, Nerevar, true to his oath, would return to punish us for our perfidy, and to make sure such profane knowledge might never again be used to mock and defy the will of the gods. But Sotha Sil said to her, \"The old gods are cruel and arbitrary, and distant from the hopes and fears of mer. Your age is past. We are the new gods, born of the flesh, and wise and caring of the needs of our people. Spare us your threats and chiding, inconstant spirit. We are bold and fresh, and will not fear you.\"\nAnd then, in that moment, all Chimer were changed into &lt;a href=\"Dunmer\"&gt;Dunmer&lt;/a&gt;, and our skins turned ashen and our eyes into fire. Of course, we only knew at that time that this had happened to us, but Azura said \"This is not my act, but your act. You have chosen your fate, and the fate of your people, and all the Dunmer shall share your fate, from now to the end of time. You think yourselves gods, but you are blind, and all is darkness.\" And Azura left us alone, in darkness, and we were all afraid, but we put on brave faces, and went forth from Red Mountain to build the new world of our dreams.\nAnd the new world we shaped was glorious and generous, and the worship of the Dunmer fervent and grateful. The Dunmer were at first afraid of their new faces, but Sotha Sil spoke to them, saying that it was not a curse but a blessing, a sign of their changed natures, and sign of the special favor they might enjoy as New Mer, no longer barbarians trembling before ghosts and sperits, but civilized mer, speaking directly to their immortal friends and patrons, the three faces of the Tribunal. And we were all inspired by Sotha Sil's speech and vision, and took heart. And over time, we crafted the customs and institutions of a just and honorable society, and the land of Resdayn knew millennia of peace, equity, and prosperity unknown to other savage races.\nBut beneath Red Mountain, Dagoth Ur had survived. And even as the light of our bold new world shined ever more brightly, beneath Red Mountain, the darkness gathered, a darkness that was close kin to the bright light that Sotha Sil coaxed from the Heart of Lorkhan with the Tools of Kagrenac. As the darkness grew, we fought it, and crafted walls to confine it, but we never could destroy it, for the source of the darkness was the same source as the source of our own divine inspiration.\nAnd in these latter days of Morrowind, reduced to a subjugated province of the Western Empire, as the glory of the Temple fades, and the dark tide rises from Red Mountain, we are reminded of Azura and her promised champion's return. We have waited, blind and in darkness, mere shadows, drained of our ardent vision, in shame of our folly, in fear of our judgement, and in hope of our deliverance. We do not know if the outlander claiming to fulfill the prophecies of the Nerevarine is our old companion Nevevar reborn, or a pawn of the Emperor, or a catspaw of &lt;a href=\"Azura\"&gt;Azura&lt;/a&gt;, or some simple twist of fate. But we insist you adhere to Temple doctrine, and conform to the strictures dividing the Hierographa from the Apographa, and that you not speak that which must not be spoken openly. Act as a dutiful priest should, in accordance with your vows of obedience to the canons and archcanons, and all will be forgiven. Defy me, and you will know what it is to stand against a god.\n-- &lt;a href=\"Vivec\"&gt;Vivec&lt;/a&gt;"}

We should destroy them, right away, lest they fall into the wrong hands.\"\nBut Nerevar was resolved to confer with his queen and his generals, who had foreseen that this war would come and whose counsel he would not ignore again. \"I will ask the &lt;a href=\"Tribunal%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Tribunal&lt;/a&gt; what we shall do with them, for they have had wisdom in the past that I had not. Stay here, loyal Dagoth Ur, until I return.\" So Nerevar told Dagoth Ur to protect the tools and the Heart Chamber until he returned.\nThen Nerevar was carried to us where we waited on the slopes of Red Mountain, and he told us all that had transpired under Red Mountain. What Nerevar had said was that the Dwemer had used special tools to turn their people into immortals and that the Heart of Lorkhan held wondrous powers. Only later did we hear from others present that Dagoth Ur had thought the Dwemer destroyed, not made immortal. And no one knows for sure what really happened there."}

And who knows, perhaps the &lt;a href=\"Dwemer\"&gt;Dwemer&lt;/a&gt; are not gone forever, but merely transported to some distant realm, from which they may someday return to threaten our security once again. Therefore, we need to keep these tools, to study them and their principles, so that we may be safe in future generations.\"\nAnd though Nerevar voiced his grave misgivings, he was willing to be ruled by our counsel, under one condition: that we all together should swear a solemn oath upon &lt;a href=\"Azura\"&gt;Azura&lt;/a&gt; that the tools would never be used in the profane manner that the Dwemer had intended. We all readily agreed, and swore solemn oaths at Nerevar's dictation.\nSo then we went with Nerevar back into &lt;a href=\"Red%20Mountain\"&gt;Red Mountain&lt;/a&gt; and met with &lt;a href=\"Dagoth%20Ur%20%28Character%29\"&gt;Dagoth Ur&lt;/a&gt;. Dagoth Ur refused to deliver the tools to us, saying they were dangerous, and we could not touch them. Dagoth Ur seemed to be irrational, insisting that only he could be trusted with the tools, and then we guessed that he had somehow been affected by his handling of the tools, but now I feel sure that he had privately learned the powers of the tools, and had in some confused way decided he must have them for himself. Then Nerevar and our guard resorted to force to secure the tools. Somehow Dagoth Ur and his retainers escaped, but we gained the tools, and delivered them to &lt;a href=\"Sotha%20Sil\"&gt;Sotha Sil&lt;/a&gt; for study and safe-keeping.\nFor some years we kept the oaths we swore to Azura with Nerevar, but during that time, in secret, Sotha Sil must have studied the tools and divined their mysteries. And at last he came to us with a vision of a new world of peace, with justice and honor for nobles, and health and prosperity for the commoners, with the &lt;a href=\"Tribunal%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Tribunal&lt;/a&gt; as immortal patrons and guides. And dedicating ourselves to this vision of a better world, we made a pilgrimage to Red Mountain and transformed ourselves with the power of Kagrenac's tools.\nAnd no sooner than we had completed our rituals and begun to discover our new-found powers, the &lt;a href=\"Daedric%20Princes\"&gt;Daedra Lord&lt;/a&gt; Azura appeared and cursed us for our forsworn oaths. By her powers of prophecy, she assured us that her champion, Nerevar, true to his oath, would return to punish us for our perfidy, and to make sure such profane knowledge might never again be used to mock and defy the will of the gods. But Sotha Sil said to her, \"The old gods are cruel and arbitrary, and distant from the hopes and fears of mer. Your age is past. We are the new gods, born of the flesh, and wise and caring of the needs of our people. Spare us your threats and chiding, inconstant spirit. We are bold and fresh, and will not fear you.\"\nAnd then, in that moment, all Chimer were changed into &lt;a href=\"Dunmer%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Dunmer&lt;/a&gt;, and our skins turned ashen and our eyes into fire. Of course, we only knew at that time that this had happened to us, but Azura said, \"This is not my act, but your act. You have chosen your fate, and the fate of your people, and all the Dunmer shall share your fate, from now to the end of time. You think yourselves gods, but you are blind, and all is darkness.\" And Azura left us alone, in darkness, and we were all afraid, but we put on brave faces, and went forth from Red Mountain to build the new world of our dreams.\nAnd the new world we shaped was glorious and generous, and the worship of the Dunmer fervent and grateful. The Dunmer were at first afraid of their new faces, but Sotha Sil spoke to them, saying that it was not a curse but a blessing, a sign of their changed natures, and sign of the special favor they might enjoy as New &lt;a href=\"Mer\"&gt;Mer&lt;/a&gt;, no longer barbarians trembling before ghosts and spirits, but civilized mer, speaking directly to their immortal friends and patrons, the three faces of the Tribunal. And we were all inspired by Sotha Sil's speech and vision, and took heart. And over time, we crafted the customs and institutions of a just and honorable society, and the land of Resdayn knew millennia of peace, equity, and prosperity unknown to other savage races."}

It is said that when the &lt;a href=\"Empire\"&gt;Empire&lt;/a&gt; abandoned &lt;a href=\"Skyrim\"&gt;Skyrim&lt;/a&gt;, and the natives of &lt;a href=\"The%20Reach%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;the Reach&lt;/a&gt; rebelled (undoubtedly due to the poor treatment of them), Ulfric Stormcloak and his militia was there to retake \"their\" land from the Forsworn. In all the bravado and epic yarns the &lt;a href=\"Bards%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;skalds&lt;/a&gt; compose of his exploits, you would think Ulfric to be a giant of a man, equal to that of &lt;a href=\"Tiber%20Septim\"&gt;Tiber Septim&lt;/a&gt; in his cunning, leadership, and decisive actions.\nBut the truth is far more revealing. Yes, from 4E 174-176, the Forsworn did in fact rule over the Reach as an independent kingdom from Skyrim. Yes, this was accomplished while the Empire was beset by &lt;a href=\"Aldmeri%20Dominion%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Aldmeri Dominion&lt;/a&gt; forces and could not send the Legion to re-establish order. And yes, Ulfric Stormcloak did quell the rebellion without Imperial assistance. That much is true, but what the bards often fail to tell in their stories is that the Forsworn Kingdom was quite peaceful for those 2 years they were in power.\nTrue, some crimes were committed against former Nord landowners (often those accused of being the harshest towards their native workers), but on the whole the Forsworn ruled their lands fairly, and were making overtures to be recognized by the Empire as a legitimate kingdom.\nIn the wake of the aftermath of the &lt;a href=\"Great%20War\"&gt;Great War&lt;/a&gt;, you can imagine the backlog on stately matters the Empire had. Before a peace treaty could be resolved with the Forsworn, a militia led by Ulfric Stormcloak sieged the gates of their capital, Markarth. What happened during that battle was war, but what happened after the battle was over is nothing short of war crimes.\nEvery official who worked for the Forsworn was put to the sword, even after they had surrendered. Native women were tortured to give up the names of Forsworn fighters who had fled the city or were in the hills of the Reach. Anyone who lived in the city, Forsworn and Nord alike, were executed if they had not fought with Ulfric and his men when they breached the gates. \"You are with us, or you are against Skyrim\" was the message on Ulfric's lips as he ordered the deaths of shopkeepers, farmers, the elderly, and any child old enough to lift a sword that had failed in the call to fight with him.\nSo when a \"grateful\" Empire accepted Ulfric's victory and sent soldiers to re-establish the rule of law in the Reach, it was no surprise that he would demand to be allowed to worship &lt;a href=\"Talos\"&gt;Talos&lt;/a&gt; freely before the Legion could enter. With chaos running through the streets of Markarth and the reports of deaths rising every day, the Empire had no choice but to grant Ulfric and his men their worship.\nWe allowed them to worship Talos, in full violation of the &lt;a href=\"White-Gold%20Concordat\"&gt;White-Gold Concordat&lt;/a&gt; with the Aldmeri Dominion (which recognizes the &lt;a href=\"Mer\"&gt;elven&lt;/a&gt; belief that Talos, as a human, cannot be one of &lt;a href=\"the%20Divines\"&gt;the Divines&lt;/a&gt;). In jeopardizing the treaty that so many sacrificed for during the Great War, the Empire was wrong. But what choice did they have, I ask you? Against the Bear of Markarth, Ulfric Stormcloak, \"no\" is not an answer."}

But where to start? Never fear, you hold in your hands the guide to everything you need to know. Before long, you'll be gazing complacently across your well-tended lands from the porch of your own manor house.\nGetting Started.\nThere are two vital pieces of equipment that the prospective homeowner needs: the &lt;a href=\"Drafting%20Table\"&gt;Drafting Table&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Carpenter%27s%20Workbench\"&gt;Carpenter's Workbench&lt;/a&gt;.\nYour Drafting Table is where you'll lay out the plans for each stage of your new house. Don't worry about making a mistake here - you can always change your mind, and making a new plan costs you nothing. Remember: measure twice and cut once.\nYour Carpenter's Workbench is where you'll do the actual construction. Once you've settled on a plan at the Drafting Table, you can start building your house at the Carpenter's Workbench. Avoid the common beginner's mistake - don't try to build the roof without building the proper supports first!\nSpace for the Family.\nIf you have a spouse or children, you'll certainly want to get the house in a livable state as soon as possible. Your loving spouse will no doubt make do with nothing more than a roof over her head and a bed to sleep in, but what about the children? Don't worry - all they need is a bed and a chest or dresser to store their treasures, and they will be perfectly content.\nBuilding Materials.\nYou will need a lot of supplies to complete your house, but it isn't necessary to gather everything you need ahead of time. Unless you're in a hurry, you can just build in stages as materials become available. You'll enjoy watching your home progress from dream to reality.\nThe most common materials you'll need are &lt;a href=\"Sawn%20Log\"&gt;sawn logs&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Quarried%20Stone\"&gt;cut stone&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"clay\"&gt;clay&lt;/a&gt;. Luckily, these are plentiful in Skyrim - in fact, most building sites will have one or more easily accessible sources of clay and stone. For sawn lumber, any &lt;a href=\"Locations%20%28Skyrim%29%23Lumber%20Mills\"&gt;lumber mill&lt;/a&gt; owner will be glad to sell and deliver as much as you need.\nYou'll need a lot of nails - fortunately even a novice &lt;a href=\"Blacksmiths%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;blacksmith&lt;/a&gt; will soon find themselves turning &lt;a href=\"Iron%20Ingot%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;iron&lt;/a&gt; into nails with ease.\nWhen you turn to furnishing your completed house, you'll need a much wider variety of materials. Some of them, such as &lt;a href=\"Straw%20%28Hearthfire%29\"&gt;straw&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Glass%20%28Hearthfire%29\"&gt;glass&lt;/a&gt;, are commonly obtained from &lt;a href=\"General%20Goods%20Merchants%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;general goods stores&lt;/a&gt;. For the rest - the whole of Skyrim will become your general store!\nHiring a Steward.\nOnce your estate is well-established, you may wish to consider hiring a &lt;a href=\"Steward%20%28Hearthfire%29\"&gt;steward&lt;/a&gt; to help manage your affairs. A good steward can be invaluable - from hiring a &lt;a href=\"Carriage\"&gt;carriage driver&lt;/a&gt; to buying a cow to keeping you supplied with building materials - freeing you to enjoy the fruits of your labors.\nBefore hiring a steward, it's advisable to bring a potential candidate to your manor and observe whether they are a good fit for your requirements. Remember, you are putting your entire estate into their hands - you need someone you can trust implicitly.\nBuilding Your House.\nThe rest of this guide will review plans for each room that you might want to build.\nAdditions.\nOnce you've built a Main Hall, your options become almost unlimited - you now have room to add three more additional wings, if you decide you still need space.\nFor each wing, you have three choices of what to build, giving a total of nine possible additions! (But remember - you can only build three of them, so choose wisely.)"}

The dock is in use. Can't let you pass.\"\nUpon gaining access to the docks, the Hero finds a number of mercenaries. Approaching these mercenaries results in them engaging in combat. The dockmaster can be found in the eastern part of the docks, while the smuggler can be found standing on the pier. Approaching the dockmaster will result in him saying the following, and attempting to kill the hero:\n\"Who are you? And why did the guard let you in?\"\nUpon defeating the Dockmaster, the ship sets sail, and the smuggled goods escape. Upon clearing the docks, Wanum approaches.\nVillager Dialogue.\nIn the village, numerous villagers can be spoken to about the shipment:\nFirst part of the village.\n\"Oh, a new face! Anything I can do for you?\"\n\"Haven't seen you around before. What do you want?\"\n\"Hello.\"\n\"What?\"\n\"You don't look like a sailor.

Some of those spells, like the early &lt;a href=\"First%20Era\"&gt;First Era&lt;/a&gt; \"&lt;a href=\"Aninaire%27s%20Tower\"&gt;Aninaire's Tower&lt;/a&gt;,\" create physical fields around their targets. These varieties are unbreachable unless broken by an appropriate amount of force\u2014like conjured stone walls, or shield &lt;a href=\"ward\"&gt;ward&lt;/a&gt;s turned inward. The effect differs in strength from spell to spell, but is generally effective for containing the layman prisoner and certainly tougher to break free from than brick and mortar.\nOf course, sometimes a mage seeks to confine creatures that walls won't hold, magical or otherwise. Gaseous forms of the &lt;a href=\"Wild%20Hunt\"&gt;Wild Hunt&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Nether%20Lich\"&gt;Nether Lich&lt;/a&gt;es, and various &lt;a href=\"ghost\"&gt;ghost&lt;/a&gt;s and phantoms all have means to escape physical barriers. These must be imprisoned using spells that create completely impermeable surfaces while absorbing or stemming the &lt;a href=\"magicka\"&gt;magicka&lt;/a&gt; of their captives. These spells must be re-incanted constantly to avoid consuming themselves, usually at a high cost of magicka for the caster.\nThe Binding Stone, which your Head Keeper will soon introduce to you if he hasn't already, functions as a combination of these spells. It's tangible, small, and therefore portable, but capable of holding all manner of magicka-wielding creatures\u2014even ones as powerful as &lt;a href=\"Rilis%20XII\"&gt;your charge&lt;/a&gt;.\nI'm sure you understand the grave nature of what the prisoner's escape would mean, both to you, personally, and to &lt;a href=\"Auridon\"&gt;Auridon&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Tamriel\"&gt;Tamriel&lt;/a&gt; as a whole. The condition of the Binding Stone is more important than the condition of your prisoner. Indeed, your very lives depend on the upkeep and maintenance of the Stone.\nAnd as for your prisoner: do not look at him. Do not speak to him. There is no specific danger in doing so, but any such interaction is a fruitless venture. Watch yourself, watch each other, do your duty, and your name will live forever among those who have committed everything to shield Auridon from his menace."}

My experience with the ways of the titled aristocracy was very limited before that day. There were wealthy merchants, traders, diplomats, and officials who had large operations in &lt;a href=\"Eldenroot\"&gt;Eldenroot&lt;/a&gt;, and ostentatious palaces for entertaining, but my relatives were all far from those social circles.\nThere was no family business for me to enter when I reached adulthood, but my cousin heard that an estate far from the city required servants. It was so remotely located that there were unlikely to be many applicants for the positions. I walked for five days into the jungles of &lt;a href=\"Valenwood\"&gt;Valenwood&lt;/a&gt; before I met a group of riders going my direction. They were three Bosmer men, one &lt;a href=\"Bosmer\"&gt;Bosmer&lt;/a&gt; woman, two &lt;a href=\"Breton\"&gt;Breton&lt;/a&gt; women, and a &lt;a href=\"Dunmer\"&gt;Dunmer&lt;/a&gt; man, adventurers from the look of them.\n\u201cAre you also going to Moliva?\u201d asked Prolyssa, one of the Breton women, after we had made our introductions.\n\u201cI don't know what that is,\u201d I replied. \u201cI'm seeking a domestic position with the Duchess of Woda.\u201d\n\u201cWe'll take you to her gate,\u201d said the Dunmer Missun Akin, pulling me up to his horse. \u201cBut you would be wise not to tell Her Grace that students from Moliva escorted you. Not unless you don't really want the position in her service.\u201d\nAkin explained himself as we rode on. Moliva was the closest village to the Duchess's estate, where a great and renowned archer had retired after a long life of military service. His name was Hiomaste, and though he was retired, he had begun to accept students who wished to learn the art of the bow. In time, when word spread of the great teacher, more and more students arrived to learn from the Master. The Breton women had come down all the way from the Western Reach of &lt;a href=\"High%20Rock\"&gt;High Rock&lt;/a&gt;. Akin himself had journeyed across the continent from his home near the &lt;a href=\"Red%20Mountain\"&gt;great volcano&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Morrowind\"&gt;Morrowind&lt;/a&gt;. He showed me the &lt;a href=\"ebony\"&gt;ebony&lt;/a&gt; arrows he had brought from his homeland. I had never seen anything so black.\n\u201cFrom what we've heard,\u201d said Kopale, one of the Bosmer men. \u201cThe Duchess is an &lt;a href=\"Imperial\"&gt;Imperial&lt;/a&gt; whose family has been here even before the Empire was formed, so you might think that she was accustomed to the common people of Valenwood. Nothing could be further from the truth. She despises the village, and the school most of all.\u201d\n\u201cI suppose she wants to control all the traffic in her jungle,\u201d laughed Prolyssa.\nI accepted the information with gratitude, and found myself dreading more and more my first meeting with the intolerant Duchess. My first sight of the palace through the trees did nothing to assuage my fears.\nIt was nothing like any building I had ever seen in Valenwood. A vast edifice of stone and iron, with a jagged row of battlements like the jaws of a great beast. Most of the trees near the palace had been hewn away long ago: I could only imagine the scandal that must have caused, and what fear the Bosmer peasants must have had of the Duchy of Woda to have allowed it. In their stead was a wide gray-green moat circling in a ring around the palace, so it seemed to be on a perfect if artificial island. I had seen such sights in tapestries from High Rock and the Imperial Province, but never in my homeland.\n\u201cThere'll be a guard at the gate, so we'll leave you here,\u201d said Akin, stopping his horse in the road. \u201cIt'd be best for you if you weren't damned by association with us.\u201d\nI thanked my companions, and wished them good luck with their schooling. They rode on and I followed on foot. In a few minutes' time, I was at the front gate, which I noticed was linked to tall and ornate railings to keep the compound secure. When the gate-keeper understood that I was there to inquire about a domestic position, he allowed me past and signaled to another guard across the open lawn to extend the drawbridge and allow me to cross the moat.\nThere was one last security measure: the front door. An iron monstrosity with the Woda Coat of Arms across the top, reinforced by more strips of iron, and a single golden keyhole. The man standing guard unlocked the door and gave me passage into the huge gloomy gray stone palace.\nHer Grace greeted me in her drawing room. She was thin and wrinkled like a reptile, cloaked in a simple red gown. It was obviously that she never smiled. Our interview consisted of a single question.\n\u201cDo you know anything about being a junior footman in the employment of an Imperial noblewoman?\u201d Her voice was like ancient leather.\n\u201cNo, Your Grace.\u201d\n\u201cGood. No servant ever understands what needs to be done, and I particularly dislike those who think they do. You're engaged.\u201d\nLife at the palace was joyless, but the position of junior footman was very undemanding. I had nothing to do on most days except to stay out of the Duchess's sight. At such times, I usually walked two miles down the road to Moliva. In some ways, there was nothing special or unusual about the village - there are thousands of identical places in Valenwood. But on the hillside nearby was Master Hiomaste's archery academy, and I would often take my luncheon and watch the practice.\nProlyssa and Akin would sometimes meet me afterwards. With Akin, the subjects of conversation very seldom strayed far from archery. Though I was very fond of him, I found Prolyssa a more enchanting companion, not only because she was pretty for a Breton, but also because she seemed to have interests outside the realm of marksmanship.\n\u201cThere's a circus in High Rock I saw when I was a little girl called the Quill Circus,\u201d she said during one of our walks through the woods. \u201cThey've been around for as long as anyone can remember. You have to see them if you ever can. They have plays, and sideshows, and the most amazing acrobats and archers you've ever seen. That's my dream, to join them some day when I'm good enough.\u201d\n\u201cHow will you know when you're a good enough archer?\u201d I asked.\nShe didn't answer, and when I turned, I realized that she had disappeared. I looked around, bewildered, until I heard laughter from the tree above me. She was perched on a branch, grinning.\n\u201cI may not join as an &lt;a href=\"archer\"&gt;archer&lt;/a&gt;, maybe I'll join as an &lt;a href=\"acrobat\"&gt;acrobat&lt;/a&gt;,\u201d she said. \u201cOr maybe as both. I figured that Valenwood would be the place to go to see what I could learn. You've got all those great teachers to imitate in the trees here. Those ape men.\u201d\nShe coiled up, bracing her left leg before springing forward on her right. In a second, she had leapt across to a neighboring branch. I found it difficult to keep talking to her.\n\u201cThe Imga, you mean?\u201d I stammered. \u201cAren't you nervous up at that height?\u201d\n\u201cIt's a cliche, I know,\u201d she said, jumping to an even higher branch, \u201cBut the secret is not to ever look down.\u201d\n\u201cWould you mind coming down?\u201d\n\u201cI probably should anyhow,\u201d she said. She was a good thirty feet up now, balancing herself, arms outstretched, on a very narrow branch. She gestured toward the gate just barely visible on the other side of the road. \u201cThis tree is actually as close as I want to get to your Duchess's palace.\u201d\nI held back a gasp as she dove off the branch, somersaulting until she landed on the ground, knees slightly bent. That was the trick, she explained. Anticipating the blow before it happened. I expressed to her my confidence that she would be a great attraction at the Quill Circus. Of course, I know now that never was to be.\nOn that day, as I recall, I had to return early. It was one of the rare occasions when I had work, of a sort, to do. Whenever the Duchess had guests, I was to be at the palace. That is not to say that I had any particular duties, except to be seen standing at attention in the dining room. The stewards and maids worked hard to bring in the food and clear the plates afterwards, but the footmen were purely decorative, a formality.\nBut at least I was an audience for the drama to come."}

The servants' gossip was manic. The mayor had been there before, albeit very irregularly, but Hiomaste's presence was unthinkable. What could she mean by such a conciliatory gesture?\nThe dinner itself progressed along with perfect if slightly cool civility among all parties. Hiomaste and the Duchess were both very quiet. The Mayor tried to engage the group in a discussion of the &lt;a href=\"Pelagius%20Septim%20IV\"&gt;Emperor Pelagius Septim IV&lt;/a&gt;'s new son and heir &lt;a href=\"Uriel%20Septim%20VII\"&gt;Uriel&lt;/a&gt;, but it failed to spark much interest. Lady Villea, elderly but much more vivacious than her sister the Duchess, led most of the talk about crime and scandal in Eldenroot.\n\u201cI have been encouraging her to move out to the country, away from all that unpleasantness for years now,\u201d the Duchess said, meeting the eyes of the Mayor. \u201cWe've been discussing more recently the possibility of her building a palace on Moliva Hill, but there's so little space there as you know. Fortunately, we've come to a discovery. There is a wide field just a few days west, on the edge of the river, ideally suited.\u201d\n\u201cIt sounds perfect,\u201d the Mayor smiled and turned to Lady Villea: \u201cWhen will your ladyship begin building?\u201d\n\u201cThe very day you move your village to the site,\u201d replied the Duchess of Woda.\nThe Mayor turned to her to see if she was joking. She obviously was not.\n\u201cThink of how much more commerce you could bring to your village if you were close to the river,\u201d said Lady Villea jovially. \u201cAnd Master Hiomaste's students could have easier access to his fine school. Everyone would benefit. I know it would put my sister's heart to ease if there was less trespassing and poaching on her lands.\u201d\n\u201cThere is no poaching or trespassing on your lands now, Your Grace,\u201d frowned Hiomaste. \u201cYou do not own the jungle, nor will you. The villagers may be persuaded to leave, that I don't know. But my school will stay where it is.\u201d\nThe dinner party never really recovered happily. Hiomaste and the Mayor excused themselves, and my services, such as they were, were not needed in the drawing room where the group went to have their drinks. There was no laughter to be heard through the walls that evening.\nThe next day, even though there was a dinner planned for the evening, I left on my usual walk to Moliva. Before I had even reached the drawbridge, the guard held me back: \u201cWhere are you going, &lt;a href=\"Gorgic%20Guine\"&gt;Gorgic&lt;/a&gt;? Not to the village, are you?\u201d\n\u201cWhy not?\u201d\nHe pointed to the plume of smoke in the distance: \u201cA fire broke out very early this morning, and it's still going. Apparently, it started at Master Hiomaste's school. It looks like the work of some traveling brigands.\u201d\n\u201cBlessed &lt;a href=\"Stendarr\"&gt;Stendarr&lt;/a&gt;!\u201d I cried. \u201cAre the students alive?\u201d\n\u201cNo one knows, but it'd be a miracle if any survived. It was late and most everyone was sleeping. I know they've already found the Master's body, or what was left of it. And they also found that girl, your friend, Prolyssa.\u201d\nI spent the day in a state of shock. It seemed inconceivable what my instinct told me: that the two noble old ladies, Lady Villea and the Duchess of Woda, had arranged for a village and school that irritated them to be reduced to ashes. At dinner, they mentioned the fire in Moliva only very briefly, as if it were not news at all. But I did see the Duchess smile for the first time ever. It was a smile I will never forget until the day I die.\nThe next morning, I had resolved to go to the village and see if I could be of any assistance to the survivors. I was passing through the servants' hall to the grand foyer when I heard the sound of a group of people ahead. The guards and most of the servants were there, pointing at the portrait of the Duchess that hung in the center of the hall.\nThere was a single black bolt of ebony piercing the painting, right at the Duchess's heart.\nI recognized it at once. It was one of &lt;a href=\"Missun%20Akin\"&gt;Missun Akin&lt;/a&gt;'s arrows I had seen in his quiver, forged, he said, in the bowels of &lt;a href=\"Dagoth%20Ur%20%28Morrowind%20Location%29\"&gt;Dagoth-Ur&lt;/a&gt; itself. My first reaction was relief: the &lt;a href=\"Dunmer\"&gt;Dunmer&lt;/a&gt; who had been kind enough to give me a ride to the palace had survived the fire. My second reaction was echoed by all present in the hall. How had the vandal gotten past the guards, the gate, the moat, and the massive iron door?\nThe Duchess, arriving shortly after I, was clearly furious, though she was too well bred to show it but by raising her web-thin eyebrows. She wasted no time in assigning all her servants to new duties to keep the palace grounds guarded at all times. We were given regular shifts and precise, narrow patrols.\nThe next morning, despite all precautions, there was another black arrow piercing the Duchess's portrait.\nSo it continued for a week's time. The Duchess saw to it that at least one person was always present in the foyer, but somehow the arrow always found its way to her painting whenever the guard's eyes were momentarily averted.\nA complex series of signals were devised, so each patrol could report back any sounds or disturbances they encountered during their vigil. At first, the Duchess arranged them so her castellan would receive record of any disturbances during the day, and the chief of the guard during the night. But when she found that she could not sleep, she made certain that the information came to her directly.\nThe atmosphere in the palace had shifted from gloomy to nightmarish. A snake would slither across the moat, and suddenly Her Grace would be tearing through the east wing to investigate. A strong gust of wind ruffling the leaves on one of the few trees in the lawn was a similar emergency. An unfortunate lone traveler on the road in front of the palace, a completely innocent man as it turned out, brought such a violent reaction that he must have thought that he had stumbled on a war. In a way, he had.\nAnd every morning, there was a new arrow in the front hall, mocking her.\nI was given the terrible assignment of guarding the portrait for a few hours in the early morning. Not wanting to be the one to discover the arrow, I seated myself in a chair opposite, never letting my eyes move away for even a second. I don't know if you've had the experience of watching one object relentlessly, but it has a strange effect. All other senses vanish. That was why I was particularly startled when the Duchess rushed into the room, blurring the gulf for me between her portrait and herself.\n\u201cThere's something moving behind the tree across the road from the gate!\u201d she roared, pushing me aside, and fumbling with her key in the gold lock.\nShe was shaking with madness and excitement, and the key did not seem to want to go in. I reached out to help her, but the Duchess was already kneeling, her eye to the keyhole, to be certain that the key went through.\nIt was precisely in that second that the arrow arrived, but this one never made it as far as the portrait.\nI actually met Missun Akin years later, while I was in &lt;a href=\"Morrowind\"&gt;Morrowind&lt;/a&gt; to entertain some nobles. He was impressed that I had risen from being a humble domestic servant to being a bard of some renown. He himself had returned to the &lt;a href=\"ashlands\"&gt;ashlands&lt;/a&gt;, and, like his old master Hiomaste, was retired to the simple life of teaching and hunting.\nI told him that I had heard that Lady Villea decided not to leave the city, and that the village of Modiva had been rebuilt. He was happy to hear that, but I could not find a way to ask him what I really wanted to know. I felt like a fool just wondering if what I thought were true, that he had been behind Prolyssa's tree across the road from the gate every morning that summer, firing an arrow through the gate, across the lawn, across the moat, through a keyhole, and into a portrait of the Duchess of Woda until he struck the Duchess herself. It was clearly an impossibility. I chose not to ask.\nAs we left one another that day, and he was waving good-bye, he said, \u201cI am pleased to see you doing so well, my friend. I am happy you moved that chair.\u201d"}

Virtually all the earliest laws of the land make mention of it as expressly forbidden on pain of death. Independent practitioners of the arts of sorcery, however, continued its study.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Psijic%20Order\"&gt;Psijic Order&lt;/a&gt; of the &lt;a href=\"Isle%20of%20Artaeum\"&gt;Isle of Artaeum&lt;/a&gt;, precursor to our own &lt;a href=\"Mages%20Guild\"&gt;Mages Guild&lt;/a&gt;, also forbade its use, not only because it was dangerous, but their belief in the holy and unholy ancestor spirits made it heretical. Again, despite this, we hear many stories of students and masters who ignored this stricture. When &lt;a href=\"Vanus%20Galerion\"&gt;Vanus Galerion&lt;/a&gt; left Artaeum, he may have disagreed with the Psijics on much, but he also refused to allow &lt;a href=\"Necromancy\"&gt;Necromancy&lt;/a&gt; to be taught in the Guild.\nAlmost 1100 years have passed since the time of Vanus Galerion, and there have been many archmagisters to lead his guild. The question of Necromancy has continued to be asked. The strictures against it in the Guild have never been lifted, but attitudes about it have shifted back and forth over the years. Some archmagisters have been inclined to ignore it entirely, some have fought very actively against it, and still other archmagisters have been rumored to be Necromancers themselves.\nIn my new role as Archmagister of the Mages Guild, it is my duty to set policy on this matter. Though I have my own opinions on the Black Arts, I took counsel with two of the most learned mages in the Empire, Magister &lt;a href=\"Voth%20Karlyss\"&gt;Voth Karlyss&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"Corinth\"&gt;Corinth&lt;/a&gt; and Magister &lt;a href=\"Ulliceta%20gra-Kogg\"&gt;Ulliceta gra-Kogg&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"Orsinium\"&gt;Orsinium&lt;/a&gt;, and we debated for two days.\nWhat follows are summaries of the salient points of the debate, arguments and counter-arguments, which led to the resolution of the Mages Guild on the subject of Necromancy.\nArgument.\nArgument by Master gra-Kogg: Necromancy is poorly understood. We will not make it disappear by ignoring it. As an intellectual institution dedicated to the study of the magickal arts and sciences, we have obligations to the truth. Censoring ourselves in our scholarship is antithetical to our mission of neutrality and objectivity.\nCounter-Argument by Master Karlyss: The Mages Guild must balance its quest for knowledge with responsible caution and ethical standards. It is not 'censoring' a student's course of study to have him proceed cautiously and with purity of purpose. It is not limiting a student's freedom to set rules and boundaries - indeed, it is essential.\nArgument by Master Karlyss: Necromancy is an anathema throughout the civilized world. To embrace it publicly, the Mages Guild would inspire fear and hostility in the populace at large. Vanus Galerion wanted this institution to be unlike the Psijic Order, which was elitist and separatist. We ignore public opinion at our own risk. We will certainly lose our charters in many places including, very likely, the whole of Morrowind, where sentiment against Necromancy is very strong.\nCounter-Argument by Master gra-Kogg: Yes, we should be sensitive to the concerns of the community, but they should not and must not dictate our scholarship. 'Necromancer' to many uneducated persons simply means an evil mage. It is madness to limit our work because of prejudices and half-formed understanding. It is an affront to the purpose of objective study to turn our back on a subject merely because of public opinion.\nArgument by Master gra-Kogg: Necromancers are the scourge of &lt;a href=\"Tamriel\"&gt;Tamriel&lt;/a&gt;. Whether operating independently or in concert with the &lt;a href=\"sload\"&gt;sload&lt;/a&gt;s or King of Worms, &lt;a href=\"Mannimarco\"&gt;Mannimarco&lt;/a&gt;, they are responsible for many horrors, animated zombies and skeletons and other forms of the undead. To best combat this menace, we must understand the powers of the Necromancer, and we cannot do that by restricting our study of the Black Arts.\nCounter-Argument by Master Karlyss: No one is disputing the threat of the Black Arts - in fact, that is the very essence of my argument against the Mages Guild making it a School to be taught to our initiates. We can and should know what our enemy is capable of, but we must be careful not to step into a trap of looking too deep into his ways, and making those ways our own. We do no one any good if by studying the evil ways, we become evil ourselves.\nArgument by Master Karlyss: Necromancy is inherently dangerous. One cannot 'dabble' in it. The simplest spell requires the spilling of blood, and immediately begins to corrupt the caster's soul. This is not conjecture, but simple fact. It is irresponsible of the Guild to teach and thereby encourage a sort of magickal study which has proven itself, time and time again, to bring nothing but terror and misery on the practitioner and world.\nCounter-Argument by Master gra-Kogg: All Schools of magicka are dangerous to the uninitiated. A simple fireball spell from the School of &lt;a href=\"Destruction\"&gt;Destruction&lt;/a&gt; can cause great harm when cast by a novice, not only to others but to the mage himself. The School of &lt;a href=\"Mysticism\"&gt;Mysticism&lt;/a&gt; by its very nature forces the practitioner to divorce his mind from logic, to embrace a temporary sort of insanity, which one might argue is very like corrupting one's soul.\nArgument by Master gra-Kogg: The Guild already permits some forms of Necromancy. The 'Schools' of magicka are, as we know, artificial constructs, originally formulated by Vanus Galerion to divide and thereby simplify study. They have changed many times throughout the years, but at their heart, every Master knows, they are all linked together. When a student of Conjuration summons a guardian ghost, he is touching on the School of Necromancy. When a student of &lt;a href=\"Enchantment\"&gt;Enchantment&lt;/a&gt; uses a trapped soul, he too may be considered guilty of a Black Art. The School of Mysticism, as I have stated before, has some kinship with Necromancy as well. To state that students may not learn the ways of Necromancy is to stifle common skills in the other, more historically legitimate Schools of the Guild.\nCounter-Argument by Master Karlyss: Yes, the Schools are intertwined, but the standard spells of each School have passed the proof of time. We know that a student of Mysticism, properly instructed, will not be permanently harmed by his experience. In many ways, it is a question of extremes - how far we would permit our studies to take us. Necromancy by its nature relies on the practitioner going further into the darkness than is wise, virtually guaranteeing his destruction. It has no place in the Mages Guild.\nConclusion.\nThe risks of studying Necromancy outweigh its usefulness. The Guild does not wish to censor the study of any of its members, but it will not tolerate studies in the Black Arts, except in limited form for the purpose of combating its evil adherents. This may only been done by rare individuals who have proven themselves both highly skilled and highly cautious, and then only with my express permission and supervision.\nAfterword.\nI regret to acknowledge the truth behind the rumor that Master Ulliceta gra-Kogg was more than an apologist for Necromancy, she was a Necromancer herself. Upon this revelation, the &lt;a href=\"Order%20of%20the%20Lamp\"&gt;Knights of the Lamp&lt;/a&gt; attempted to arrest her at the Guildhouse in &lt;a href=\"Orsinium\"&gt;Orsinium&lt;/a&gt;, but she made good her escape. We have every confidence in the replacement Magister in Orsinium.\nThough I disagreed, I respected her logical reasoning enough to include her arguments in this book, and I see no reason to remove them. It is disappointing, however, to see that her interest in 'the truth' was nothing more than a euphemism for her slavery to the Black Arts.\nThis unfortunate situation merely illustrates how essential it is for Guildmembers to be wary of the lure of Necromancy, and be vigilant to its practitioners' infiltration in our Mages Guild."}

She was friends with many of the assassins in the sanctuary, including &lt;a href=\"Green-Venom-Tongue\"&gt;Green-Venom-Tongue&lt;/a&gt;. Venom and Lyra had joined the Brotherhood around the same time, and we're told horror stories by the veteran members of the group. Among them was the story of &lt;a href=\"Brombar\"&gt;Brombar&lt;/a&gt;, an assassin who betrayed his brother. Brombar was mortally wounded by his sister, who left him so that the &lt;a href=\"Wrath%20of%20Sithis%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Wrath of Sithis&lt;/a&gt; could claim his soul while he was fully aware of what was happening. Venom said that he and Lyra couldn't sleep soundly for a week after that.\nThe Purification.\nBefore long, Lyra reached the title of &lt;a href=\"Silencer\"&gt;Silencer&lt;/a&gt;, a high rank in the Brotherhood that was granted to those who showed promising skill and devotion. Green-Venom-Tongue noted her as the most skilled of any assassin in the sanctuary. For unknown reasons, the &lt;a href=\"Black%20Hand\"&gt;Black Hand&lt;/a&gt; ordered a &lt;a href=\"Purification\"&gt;Purification&lt;/a&gt; on the Xith-Izkul Sanctuary. As silencer, Lyra was ordered to kill the members of the sanctuary, a difficult task as she was close with many of them. Green-Venom-Tongue was spared, having been on a special mission and therefore no part in the matter, and was led to believe Lyra died in the purification.\nOnce the deed was done, Lyra prayed at the Statue of &lt;a href=\"Sithis\"&gt;Sithis&lt;/a&gt;, questioning him if all the deaths were what was truly right for the Dark Brotherhood. &lt;a href=\"Speaker%20Arawen\"&gt;Speaker Arawen&lt;/a&gt; arrived, assuring Lyra purification of the sanctuary was by Sithis' will. Almost immediately, she assigned Lyra's next task of assassinating &lt;a href=\"Primate%20Jonas\"&gt;Primate Jonas&lt;/a&gt; of the &lt;a href=\"Order%20of%20the%20Hour%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Order of the Hour&lt;/a&gt;. Lyra requested time to grieve for her fallen brothers and sisters, though Arawen scolded her for it, saying that she was a weapon and such bonds were weakness.\nJoining the Order.\nLyra traveled to the &lt;a href=\"Cathedral%20of%20Akatosh\"&gt;Cathedral of Akatosh&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Kvatch%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Kvatch&lt;/a&gt;, where she met &lt;a href=\"Primate%20Artorius\"&gt;Artorius Ponticus&lt;/a&gt;. Artorius told her that it was he who ordered the assassination of his superior, Primate Jonas, and that his true goal was to meet with Lyra instead. Artorius offered Lyra redemption, promising her that &lt;a href=\"Akatosh\"&gt;Akatosh&lt;/a&gt; would forgive her if she put her talents toward serving the Dragon God. He offered her to become his champion, the First Sword of the Order, a \"Black Dragon that burns away evil's darkness\". Lyra accepted, defecting from the Dark Brotherhood and joining the Order of the Hour. Under Artorius' command, she assassinated Primate Jonas, so that he could usurp his place.\nLyra became The Black Dragon, a warrior of Akatosh with the rank of First Blade, and no longer considered herself Lyra Viria. Being part of the Order was not the same being part of the Brotherhood. Lyra considered her fellow assassins as family, and the members of the Order instead respected and feared her. They showed love for no one except Akatosh, and perhaps Primate Artorius. The Black Dragon was cocksure of her actions in the Brotherhood for most of her time there, and originally in the Order, but began feeling discontent.\nTargeting the Brotherhood.\nAs the First Blade, Primate Artorius assigned the Black Dragon the task of hunting down Brotherhood members and finding the &lt;a href=\"Dark%20Brotherhood%20Sanctuary%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Sanctuary&lt;/a&gt; operating within the &lt;a href=\"Gold%20Coast%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Gold Coast&lt;/a&gt;. The Black Dragon killed a number of members, both new initiates and veteran assassins, including one named &lt;a href=\"Symdul\"&gt;Symdul&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe Black Dragon continued hunting members, and eventually captured &lt;a href=\"Cimbar\"&gt;Cimbar&lt;/a&gt;. She assigned &lt;a href=\"Grand%20Sermonizer%20Fithia\"&gt;Grand Sermonizer Fithia&lt;/a&gt; to torture Cimbar for information. Cimbar refused to reveal the location, and perished from the torture, and Fithia cast a spell on his body, which caused &lt;a href=\"Tanek\"&gt;Tanek&lt;/a&gt; to be chained to the floor. She later went to the &lt;a href=\"Enclave%20of%20the%20Hourglass\"&gt;Enclave of the Hourglass&lt;/a&gt;, and met the &lt;a href=\"Vestige\"&gt;Vestige&lt;/a&gt; under the name of Lyra. She questioned the Vestige on whether they had regrets, saying Primate Artorius believed everyone was worthy of redemption, and led her to the Black Dragon's chambers. &lt;a href=\"Mirabelle%20Motierre\"&gt;Mirabelle Motierre&lt;/a&gt;, seeking revenge on the Black Dragon for killing Cimbar, waited in her chambers in order to murder her. Mirabelle accidentally revealed her plan to Lyra, who swiftly killed Mirabelle, and threatened the Vestige.\nThe Black Dragon later found &lt;a href=\"Brema\"&gt;Brema&lt;/a&gt;, and had her reveal the location of the sanctuary before slitting her throat. She told Primate Artorius of the sanctuary's location, and set out to &lt;a href=\"Knightsgrave\"&gt;Knightsgrave&lt;/a&gt; after the Enclave of the Hourglass began to feel to confining for her.\nSeclusion in Knightsgrave.\nLyra traveled to Knightsgrave, an ancient headquarters for the Order of the Hour, now in ruins. She researched the founders and their statues, admiring their actions, specifically the original First Sword &lt;a href=\"Justia%20Desticus\"&gt;Justia Desticus&lt;/a&gt;. She later discovered the braziers served as a key into the inner parts of Knightsgrave, and quickly deciphered how to activate them. She found many &lt;a href=\"Minotaur%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Minotaur&lt;/a&gt;s within, taking careful measures to ignore them. The Black Dragon then came across the Paragon's Crown, a large circle with pillars surrounding it, and prayed to Akatosh.\nFurther into the ruins she found the grotto of Knightsgrave, which contained a large statue of Akatosh built by the &lt;a href=\"Alessian%20Order\"&gt;Alessian Order&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;a href=\"First%20Era\"&gt;First Era&lt;/a&gt;. The many cages suggested the Alessian Order performed darker rites than the Order of the Hour did in Kvatch. The Black Dragon then defected from the Order of the Hour, hating the Primate and the Dark Brotherhood for turning her into what she became.\nThe Dark Brotherhood then discovered Lyra was hiding out in Knightsgrave. &lt;a href=\"Astara%20Caerellius\"&gt;Astara Caerellius&lt;/a&gt; sent Green-Venom-Tongue and the Vestige to kill the Black Dragon. Lyra sent many shadows to communicate to them, warning them to go back. The ignored her pleas, and after they had been separated, she impaled Green-Venom-Tongue with a sword, mortally wounding him before he said his last words to the Vestige.\nThe Vestige pursued the Black Dragon, while she sent more shadows to communicate to them. At the Paragon's Crown, she sent multiple shadows with different tactics to attack and kill the Vestige, evaluating them defeat the shadows and discovering more of the Vestige's weaknesses. Finally, at Knightsgrave Grotto, the Black Dragon dueled the Vestige to the death. The Black Dragon finally perished at the Vestige's hand, and the Wrath of Sithis shackled Lyra's soul, taking her to the &lt;a href=\"Void\"&gt;Void&lt;/a&gt;.\nConversations.\nThe Black Dragon: \"\"Grand Sermonizer, have you discovered the location of the &lt;a href=\"Dark%20Brotherhood%20Sanctuary%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Sanctuary&lt;/a&gt; yet?\"\"\n&lt;a href=\"Grand%20Sermonizer%20Fithia\"&gt;Grand Sermonizer Fithia&lt;/a&gt;: \"\"Unfortunately, &lt;a href=\"Cimbar\"&gt;this assassin&lt;/a&gt; expired before revealing anything useful.\"\nBlack Dragon: \"I'll capture another. Try not to kill this one before we learn the location of the &lt;a href=\"Dark%20Brotherhood%20%28Online%20Faction%29\"&gt;Dark Brotherhood&lt;/a&gt;'s lair.\"\nFithia: \"Lord &lt;a href=\"Akatosh\"&gt;Akatosh&lt;/a&gt;, hear our prayer! Let me just prepare the body... like so.\"\"\nThe Black Dragon: \"You'd kill me, Venom? You were my Brother once. Join me and forget your obligations.\"\nGreen-Venom-Tongue: \"Join you? I'm going to send you to the Void, traitor!\"\nIn Overlook of Time:\nThe Black Dragon: \"The Dark Brotherhood is a pox. It deserves to be destroyed.\"\nGreen-Venom-Tongue: \"What lies did Artorius fill your head with, Lyra?\"\nAfter passing the corridor overlooking the flooded hall:\nThe Black Dragon: \"The Brotherhood. The Order. I'm done being used, Venom. Just leave me alone!\"\nGreen-Venom-Tongue: \"I can't do that, Lyra. You brought this on yourself.\""}
