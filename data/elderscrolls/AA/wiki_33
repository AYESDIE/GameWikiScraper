{"id": "1584", "revid": "54131200", "url": "https://elderscrolls.fandom.com/wiki?curid=1584", "title": "Night Mother", "text": " \nThe Night Mother, also known as the Blood Flower or the Lady Death, is the bride of &lt;a href=\"Sithis\"&gt;Sithis&lt;/a&gt;, the Dread Father of the &lt;a href=\"Dark%20Brotherhood\"&gt;Dark Brotherhood&lt;/a&gt;. Those who wish to have someone assassinated pray to the Night Mother by performing the &lt;a href=\"Black%20Sacrament\"&gt;Black Sacrament&lt;/a&gt;, and she extends their requests to her &lt;a href=\"Listener\"&gt;Listener&lt;/a&gt;, who in turn passes the task on to the &lt;a href=\"Speaker\"&gt;Speaker&lt;/a&gt;s. It is debatable whether she was a single person, a title passed down through the eras, or an immortal spirit.\nIdentity.\nAccording to Dark Brotherhood beliefs, she is wife of &lt;a href=\"Sithis\"&gt;Sithis&lt;/a&gt;, but was told by Sithis to kill her five young children in his name. After the deed was done, Sithis gave her the honor of being his wife and being the head of the Dark Brotherhood.\nOrigin.\nThe Night Mother is likely to have lived during the &lt;a href=\"Second%20Era\"&gt;Second Era&lt;/a&gt;, as indicated in the in-game book \"&lt;a href=\"The%20Brothers%20of%20Darkness\"&gt;The Brothers of Darkness&lt;/a&gt;\". In , her &lt;a href=\"Crypt%20of%20the%20Night%20Mother\"&gt;tomb&lt;/a&gt; is located underneath &lt;a href=\"the%20Lucky%20Old%20Lady\"&gt;the Lucky Old Lady statue&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Bravil\"&gt;Bravil&lt;/a&gt;. There are skeletal remains of one adult and five children in her tomb. This takes into account her children in Dark Brotherhood beliefs. The Night Mother might also be the same person as the Lucky Old Lady.\nOne indication of this is that the Lucky Old Lady is surrounded by five children. However, the woman depicted by the statue was said to have lived in the &lt;a href=\"First%20Era\"&gt;First Era&lt;/a&gt;. The Night Mother has also been credited as an incarnation of &lt;a href=\"Daedric%20Prince\"&gt;Daedric Prince&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Mephala\"&gt;Mephala&lt;/a&gt;, whereas she is also identified as &lt;a href=\"Severa%20Magia\"&gt;Severa Magia&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Morrowind\"&gt;Morrowind&lt;/a&gt; during the &lt;a href=\"Third%20Era\"&gt;Third Era&lt;/a&gt;. Before this, in , the Night Mother is identified simply as an immortal spirit with the likeness of either a &lt;a href=\"Redguard\"&gt;Redguard&lt;/a&gt; or a &lt;a href=\"Khajiit\"&gt;Khajiit&lt;/a&gt; woman.\nWhile the Night Mother has certainly had relations to &lt;a href=\"Morag%20Tong\"&gt;Morag Tong&lt;/a&gt;, it is questionable if she has even been the same person all along.\u00a0\"&lt;a href=\"The%20Brothers%20of%20Darkness\"&gt;The Brothers of Darkness&lt;/a&gt;\" suggests that The Night Mother is merely a title for the leaders of Morag Tong. She has most definitively made business in the first era, as suggested by \"&lt;a href=\"2920%2C%20vol%2007%20-%20Sun%27s%20Height\"&gt;2920, vol 07 - Sun's Height&lt;/a&gt;\", with &lt;a href=\"Sotha%20Sil\"&gt;Sotha Sil&lt;/a&gt;, a member of the &lt;a href=\"Psijic%20Order\"&gt;Psijic Order&lt;/a&gt;. Literature of the same year, but in &lt;a href=\"2920%2C%20vol%2012%20-%20Evening%20Star\"&gt;Evening Star&lt;/a&gt;, says \"the Night Mother stroking her daughter's hair\" the daughter being &lt;a href=\"Corda\"&gt;Corda&lt;/a&gt;, a Redguard. This suggests the Night Mother was either a Redguard herself, or has had affections with one.\nAt one point in history, when working with the &lt;a href=\"Thieves%20Guild\"&gt;Thieves Guild&lt;/a&gt; to gain popularity for the Dark Brotherhood, she has been described as \"a little old lady with fluffy white hair, cheeks like wrinkled apples that still carried the flush of youth, friendly eyes, blue as the\u00a0&lt;a href=\"Iliac%20Bay\"&gt;Iliac Bay&lt;/a&gt;.\" by a &lt;a href=\"Sacred%20Witness\"&gt;witness&lt;/a&gt;. This suggests a human race, most likely Imperial, Nord, Breton or the like.\nIt is, however, confirmed that she, the one that sacrificed her children to Sithis, lived some time in the second era and was a &lt;a href=\"Dunmer\"&gt;Dunmer&lt;/a&gt; in \"&lt;a href=\"The%20Night%20Mother%27s%20Truth\"&gt;The Night Mother's Truth&lt;/a&gt;\".\nGuild affiliation.\nAccording to \"Sacred Witness\", she was a member of the &lt;a href=\"Thieves%20Guild\"&gt;Thieves Guild&lt;/a&gt;, around the time when it was just beginning. She was one of many at the time that found it easier to just strangle the occupant of the house, rather than go through the bother of sneaking the entire time.\nShe suggested the Guild have a special group of those who specialized in such a task, just as there were for &lt;a href=\"pickpocket\"&gt;pickpocket&lt;/a&gt;ing, &lt;a href=\"Lockpicking\"&gt;lock-picking&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Fence\"&gt;fencing&lt;/a&gt;, etc., but they decided encouraging murder would be bad for business and refused. However, realizing the possible profits from killing for hire, the Night Mother began performing assassinations, and left a calling card of two stones, one white and one black, in each eye. The following she developed did not become the &lt;a href=\"Morag%20Tong\"&gt;Morag Tong&lt;/a&gt;, however. It was at this point that the Dark Brotherhood was born.\nAccording to her supposed words, the Morag Tong existed long before her time, and she merely took on those members that split from the group after the murder of the last Potentate, as she was \"the only other murder syndicate of any note.\" According to the editor's note at the end of the book, the book was originally published anonymously, but that anyone can recognize the familiar writing and cadence of &lt;a href=\"Enric%20Milres\"&gt;Enric Milres&lt;/a&gt;. It goes on to say that shortly after the publishing of this book, Milres was found \"strangled, and two stones, a black one and a white one, crushed into his eye-sockets. Very brutally.\"\nRitual.\nFor prospective clients to contact the Dark Brotherhood, they would carry out a ritual called the &lt;a href=\"Black%20Sacrament\"&gt;Black Sacrament&lt;/a&gt;. This ritual would inform the Night Mother of their intentions to have someone killed. When the Listener of the Black Hand prays to the Lucky Old Lady statue in Bravil, the Night Mother will inform the Listener about the location of those prospective clients. The Listener would then relay this information to Speakers of the Black Hand.\nQuoting the \"&lt;a href=\"Black%20Horse%20Courier\"&gt;Black Horse Courier&lt;/a&gt;\" on the &lt;a href=\"Night%20Mother%20Rituals%21\"&gt;Night Mother Rituals!&lt;/a&gt;:\n\"\"As documented in the rare and taboo work \"A Kiss, Sweet Mother,\" the Black Sacrament involves an effigy of the intended victim -- created from actual body parts, including a heart, skeleton and flesh -- within a circle of candles. To proceed with the ritual, one must stab the effigy repeatedly with a dagger rubbed with the petals of a Nightshade plant, while whispering the plea, \"Sweet Mother, sweet Mother, send your child unto me, for the sins of the unworthy must be baptized in blood and fear.\" As gruesome as this ritual may be, even more frightening is its intention -- the summoning of a mysterious assassin (who some witnesses claim is always clad in a black hooded robe) who will then receive money to kill an innocent victim. No remorse. No regret. It is, as the merchant's say, simply business. And that's what worries &lt;a href=\"Adamus%20Phillida\"&gt;Adamus Phillida&lt;/a&gt;.\"\"\nRole in history.\nCyrodiil.\nDuring the &lt;a href=\"Third%20Era\"&gt;Third Era&lt;/a&gt;, the Night Mother appears to the &lt;a href=\"Black%20Hand\"&gt;Black Hand&lt;/a&gt; in ethereal form after the Brotherhood was &lt;a href=\"Honor%20Thy%20Mother\"&gt;desecrated&lt;/a&gt; by one its &lt;a href=\"Speaker\"&gt;Speaker&lt;/a&gt;s. &lt;a href=\"Mathieu%20Bellamont\"&gt;Mathieu Bellamont&lt;/a&gt; attempted to attack her, to no avail, during this quest. The &lt;a href=\"Hero%20of%20Kvatch\"&gt;Hero of Kvatch&lt;/a&gt; might have been present during the event, serving as &lt;a href=\"Silencer\"&gt;Silencer&lt;/a&gt; to &lt;a href=\"Lucien%20Lachance\"&gt;Lucien Lachance&lt;/a&gt; up until his death and being the sole agent behind the systematic murder of the other Silencers, and the &lt;a href=\"Listener\"&gt;Listener&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Ungolim\"&gt;Ungolim&lt;/a&gt;.\nAlthough the Hero may have been responsible for the death of so many guild members, the Night Mother knew the Hero's loyalty lay with her and forgave them, allowing them to remove whatever treasures they wanted from her tomb.\nGreat War.\nIn 4E188, the Bravil Dark Brotherhood Sanctuary was raided. Listener &lt;a href=\"Alisanne%20Dupre\"&gt;Alisanne Dupre&lt;/a&gt; and the Speakers were burned to death, though the Night Mother's corpse remained intact, and was taken to the &lt;a href=\"Dark%20Brotherhood%20Sanctuary%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;Cheydinhal Sanctuary&lt;/a&gt;. The fate of her children's bodies is unknown.\nSkyrim.\nDuring the &lt;a href=\"Dragon%20Crisis\"&gt;Dragon Crisis&lt;/a&gt;, the Night Mother is delivered to the &lt;a href=\"Dark%20Brotherhood%20Sanctuary%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;sanctuary&lt;/a&gt; by &lt;a href=\"Cicero\"&gt;Cicero&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"Keeper\"&gt;Keeper&lt;/a&gt; and self-made enthusiastic jester who can be &lt;a href=\"Delayed%20Burial\"&gt;helped&lt;/a&gt; before joining the &lt;a href=\"Dark%20Brotherhood%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Dark Brotherhood&lt;/a&gt;. Years after the death of &lt;a href=\"Alisanne%20Dupre\"&gt;the last Listener&lt;/a&gt;, Cicero brought the Night Mother to &lt;a href=\"Falkreath%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Falkreath&lt;/a&gt;, where &lt;a href=\"Astrid%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Astrid's&lt;/a&gt; Dark Brotherhood existed.\nIf the &lt;a href=\"Last%20Dragonborn\"&gt;Dragonborn&lt;/a&gt; became a member of the Brotherhood, they were spoken to by the Night Mother when &lt;a href=\"Whispers%20in%20the%20Dark\"&gt;eavesdropping on Cicero&lt;/a&gt;, thus becoming her new &lt;a href=\"Listener\"&gt;Listener&lt;/a&gt;. Although sad that he was not named as Listener, Cicero remains faithful to the Night Mother and the new Listener.\nThreatened by both the Night Mother's authority and the new Listener, Astrid discourages the Dragonborn from fulfilling a contract imparted on them by the Night Mother. Later, Cicero attacked Astrid for defying the Night Mother's wishes and fled to the &lt;a href=\"Dawnstar%20Sanctuary\"&gt;Dawnstar Sanctuary&lt;/a&gt;.\nWhile the Dragonborn was &lt;a href=\"To%20Kill%20an%20Empire\"&gt;attempting to kill&lt;/a&gt; the &lt;a href=\"Titus%20Mede%20II\"&gt;Emperor&lt;/a&gt;, Astrid contacted &lt;a href=\"Commander%20Maro\"&gt;Commander Maro&lt;/a&gt;, to restore her order, by informing him that the Dragonborn would be attempting to kill the Emperor, where Maro set a trap to kill the Listener.\nAfter the failed assassination, the Listener flees back to the &lt;a href=\"Dark%20Brotherhood%20Sanctuary%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Sanctuary&lt;/a&gt;, where most of the Brotherhood's members have been killed in an attack by the &lt;a href=\"Penitus%20Oculatus\"&gt;Penitus Oculatus&lt;/a&gt;. Although &lt;a href=\"Nazir\"&gt;Nazir&lt;/a&gt; was saved, there was no way out of the exploding Sanctuary, so the Night Mother asks her Listener to \"embrace\" her, as this was the only way they would be able to survive.\nAfter the destruction of the Falkreath Sanctuary, Nazir pulls the Night Mother's coffin from the lake in the destroyed Sanctuary, and the Night Mother tells the Listener to go find Astrid, who is still within the Sanctuary. After being found, Astrid confesses that she is the one to blame for everything that has happened, and for the Listener to kill her, as she made herself the Black Sacrament.\nAfterward, the Night Mother speaks to her Listener again, telling them that the contract must still be fulfilled. As the Listener tracks down and kills the &lt;a href=\"Titus%20Mede%20II\"&gt;real Emperor&lt;/a&gt;, Nazir and &lt;a href=\"Babette\"&gt;Babette&lt;/a&gt;, who also survived the attack on the Sanctuary, move with the Night Mother to the &lt;a href=\"Dawnstar%20Sanctuary\"&gt;Dawnstar Sanctuary&lt;/a&gt;, where the Dark Brotherhood was started anew."}

So says &lt;a href=\"Adamus%20Phillida\"&gt;Adamus Phillida&lt;/a&gt;, commander of the &lt;a href=\"Imperial%20Legion%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;Imperial Legion&lt;/a&gt; forces in the &lt;a href=\"Imperial%20City%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;Imperial City&lt;/a&gt;, and a staunch opponent of the mysterious assassin's guild known as the &lt;a href=\"Dark%20Brotherhood%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;Dark Brotherhood&lt;/a&gt;. According to Phillida, Imperial Legion soldiers have discovered thirteen separate instances of the macabre \"Black Sacrament,\" a sinister rite purportedly used to summon a member of the Dark Brotherhood, in order to arrange an assassination.\nWhether or not a card-carrying killer shows up on a ritual performer's doorstep remains to be seen, but the Black Sacrament itself is very real, and truly the stuff of nightmares. As documented in the rare and taboo work \"&lt;a href=\"A%20Kiss%2C%20Sweet%20Mother\"&gt;A Kiss, Sweet Mother&lt;/a&gt;,\" the Black Sacrament involves an effigy of the intended victim -- created from actual body parts, including a heart, skull, bones and flesh -- within a circle of candles. To proceed with the ritual, one must stab the effigy repeatedly with a &lt;a href=\"Daggers%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;dagger&lt;/a&gt; rubbed with the petals of a &lt;a href=\"Nightshade%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;Nightshade&lt;/a&gt; plant, while whispering the plea, \"Sweet Mother, sweet Mother, send your child unto me, for the sins of the unworthy must be baptized in blood and fear.\" As gruesome as this ritual may be, even more frightening is its intention -- the summoning of a mysterious assassin (who some witnesseses claim is always clad in a black hooded robe) who will then receive money to kill an innocent victim. No remorse. No regret. It is, as the merchant's say, simply business. And that's what worries Adamus Phillida.\n\"This brazen increase in Night Mother rituals is an affront to the decent, peace-loving citizens of the Empire. The Imperial Legion exists for one reason and one reason only -- to protect and serve the people of Tamriel. How in &lt;a href=\"Azura\"&gt;Azura&lt;/a&gt;'s name can we do that when people take it upon themselves to contact paid &lt;a href=\"assassin\"&gt;assassin&lt;/a&gt;s and have innocent people murdered? How can I sleep at night knowing my Legion can't possibly save the life of someone marked for death by the Dark Brotherhood? Anyone who carries out this \"Black Sacrament\" makes a mockery of the Imperial Legion, and as Commander, that's something I just can't tolerate. From this point forward, any citizen found in the possession of items related to the Night Mother ritual will be incarcerated in the Imperial Prison indefinitely, and their property seized by the Empire. There's no fine high enough, no standard prison sentence long enough, for the type of malcontent who would show such a blatant disregard for our dear Emperor's laws and the wellfare of the fine people of &lt;a href=\"Tamriel\"&gt;Tamriel&lt;/a&gt;\"\nTo be sure, Adamus Phillida is not one to issue empty threats. Indeed, the Black Horse Courier has learned that one\n&lt;a href=\"Claudius%20Arcadia\"&gt;Claudius Arcadia&lt;/a&gt;, until recently a resident of the &lt;a href=\"Talos%20Plaza%20District\"&gt;Talos Plaza District&lt;/a&gt; of the Imperial City, is now residing in a cold, dank cell in the Imperial Prison, and his house has become the newest Imperial Legion outpost. So before you take the law into your own hands, dear reader, remember -- you'll go further in life with a warm smile than a cold blade. And if you've got a grudge that won't be soothed, a score that can't be settled, you can always move to &lt;a href=\"Morrowind\"&gt;Morrowind&lt;/a&gt; and have the government-sanctioned &lt;a href=\"Morag%20Tong\"&gt;Morag Tong&lt;/a&gt; do the killing for you."}

When it first appeared in our caves, I sent a group of the &lt;a href=\"Night%20Runners\"&gt;Night Runner&lt;/a&gt;'s best raiders to drive it away. Then the unthinkable happened. The big slug slaughtered them! But that wasn't enough to satisfy the creature. It's some sort of necromancer! It raised my own raiders and turned them against me!\nTwo more raiding parties fell to the Sea Sload and its undead horde. Worse, now they've become part of that undead horde! I need to rethink this untenable situation.\nI made the Sea Sload an offer and to my surprise the creature accepted it. We can continue to use the cove for our smuggling endeavors. In exchange, I just need to provide captives for K'Garza to use for its necromantic experiments. Distasteful, certainly, but a deal such as this is better than the alternative.\nWe captured an &lt;a href=\"Orsimer%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Orc&lt;/a&gt; wandering around in the caves. I had one of my raiders chain him up until K'Garza was ready for him. Luckily the poor bastard was drunk off his arse. He probably has no idea what he's in for.\nA &lt;a href=\"Altmer%20%28Online%29\"&gt;High Elf&lt;/a&gt; requested a parlay. She claims to represent the Sea Sload K'Garza, who is apparently part of something called the Abyssal Cabal. What a disturbing idea, a group of Sea Sload working together for some nefarious purpose. She presented me with an offer to submit to K'Garza's will and work for the cabal. She informed me that one of K'Garza's associates was currently operating to the south and was developing a plan by which they could sink &lt;a href=\"Summerset%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Summerset&lt;/a&gt; and return the land to the control of the Sload.\nI admit that when I heard these words, my first reaction was to gut the High Elf and send a warning to the &lt;a href=\"Divine%20Prosecution\"&gt;Divine Prosecution&lt;/a&gt;. After all, our business depends on Summerset remaining a viable land mass. However, I managed to keep my anger and disgust in check and promised to consider the offer. She warned me not to consider it for too long before I accepted the cabal's terms.\nI wonder if it's too late to set sail for &lt;a href=\"Black%20Marsh%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Black Marsh&lt;/a&gt; or someplace else that's far away."}

Conjurer's burn, as it's commonly referred to around the College. There's little doubt they were attempting a summoning ritual well beyond their capabilities.\nThe relic nearby put any doubt in this theory to rest. I admit that I've never seen one like it - a large, segmented sculpture of a gauntlet, the Daedric sigil \" emblazoned upon the palm. Attempts to move it were in vain. I must show it to Archmage Sedoth during his upcoming visit. Perhaps he will know more.\nWhile we couldn't move the relic, I was able to pry four \"rings\" from it.

Someone went to a lot of trouble to carve out these passages, but that had to have been many years ago.\nFortunately, this portion of the mine is still rich with &lt;a href=\"Silver%20%28Online%29\"&gt;silver&lt;/a&gt; and several other trace metals. You can see huge, untapped veins of ore running through the tunnel walls. But this presents us with quite a quandary regarding the fate of the original excavators. If they went to all the trouble and expense of constructing the mine, why did they abandon it before they had exhausted the vast reservoir of ore contained in the deposit?\nDay Three\nToday we finished clearing one of the collapsed tunnels and broke through into an enormous chamber beyond. I'm no historian, but I'd swear there are remnants of &lt;a href=\"Dwemer\"&gt;Dwarven&lt;/a&gt; ruins here. There are things set apart from the rock and ore that definitely aren't natural, at any rate.\n&lt;a href=\"Aesa\"&gt;Aesa&lt;/a&gt; said she heard scuttling while we were asleep last night. &lt;a href=\"Skeg\"&gt;Skeg&lt;/a&gt; told her not to worry, there are lots of things that skitter about in tunnels like this. But I've heard things too, and not the usual sounds of &lt;a href=\"Spider%20%28Online%29\"&gt;spiders&lt;/a&gt;. I almost feel like something is stalking us. Like we're being watched.\nDay Four\nWe never should have come down here. Aesa and Skeg left hours ago to scout the Dwarven ruins and neither have returned. There are &lt;a href=\"Falmer%20%28Online%29\"&gt;pale shapes&lt;/a&gt; moving in the shadows and a maddening insect-like clicking echoing through the passageways. Am I hallucinating? I'm not sure I could find my way out of this place if I tried.\nI seem to be the only one in the camp now, though I didn't see anybody leave. The clicking sounds grow louder. I hear breathing. Earlier, I swore I heard a scream in the darkness. It sounded like Aesa.\nSomething's close by. I think it can smell me."}

I'm ready to toss it in, but Bern wants to keep on going. \"Just a little further, Hadrir.\" \"We're so close, Hadrir.\" Bah.\nBern wants me to head back to &lt;a href=\"Riften%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Riften&lt;/a&gt; for supplies next week.

Khuras was one of the more expensive mines created by the &lt;a href=\"Bretons\"&gt;Bretons&lt;/a&gt;, becoming source for crystals and other types of gems. It has been abandoned, with various groups taking refuge.\nDescription.\nGeography.\nThe Mines of Khuras is situated along the coast, towards the &lt;a href=\"Iliac%20Bay\"&gt;Iliac Bay&lt;/a&gt;. It is next to the township of &lt;a href=\"Aldcroft\"&gt;Aldcroft&lt;/a&gt; and the historical battleground known as the &lt;a href=\"Glenumbra%20Moors\"&gt;Glenumbra Moors&lt;/a&gt;, Khuras itself is rather hidden, it is located behind a hill near Aldcroft. The Mines was established as a way to excavate crystals and gems, the type of minerals that are crafted into jewelry that the nobles wear throughout Glenumbra. The caverns are vast and intensely dugout; natural stone bridges tower over the floor. Deep into the Mines of Khuras has a pool of water, likely seeping from the &lt;a href=\"Hag%20Fen\"&gt;Hag Fen&lt;/a&gt; marshes located atop of the Mine. The jewels of Khuras are said to have magical properties, which makes the Mine very sought out by the Wizards and Warlocks of High Rock.\nHistory.\n&lt;a href=\"First%20Era\"&gt;First Era&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe Mines of Khuras was founded during the first era, shoveling crystals and gems to the nobility of High Rock, most likely for the city-state of &lt;a href=\"Camlorn\"&gt;Camlorn&lt;/a&gt;, the nearest Kingdom to the Mines of Khuras. However, the Mine had unfortunately closed down in &lt;a href=\"Timeline\"&gt;1E 2906&lt;/a&gt; when a ceiling collapse had rendered the tunnels of Khuras as inaccessible. Despite this shutdown, the Mines of Khuras was used again by the scoundrels of Glenumbra, as a base for their schemes.\n&lt;a href=\"Second%20Era\"&gt;Second Era&lt;/a&gt;.\nDuring the &lt;a href=\"Interregnum\"&gt;Interregnum&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"2E%20582\"&gt;2E 582&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"Bloodthorn%20Cult\"&gt;Bloodthorn Cult&lt;/a&gt; of the &lt;a href=\"Western%20Reach\"&gt;Western Reach&lt;/a&gt; waged war with the Bretons of Glenumbra to destroy and corrupt the &lt;a href=\"Daggerfall%20Covenant\"&gt;Daggerfall Covenant&lt;/a&gt;. A Bloodthorn Witch named &lt;a href=\"Lilou\"&gt;Lilou&lt;/a&gt; had taken refuge in the Mines of Khuras when a powerful gem was discovered in the cavern, that was able to enhance the power of their Bloodthorn Magic. The Mine was filled with these mystical crystals, prompting the Bloodthorn Cult to uncover the Mines of Khuras, to excavate more and more of these gems. However, an adventurer known as the &lt;a href=\"Vestige\"&gt;Vestige&lt;/a&gt; had discovered the Bloodthorn Cult in the Mines, exterminating the threat in the caverns, defeating Lilou in the process. The Bloodthorn's holding in the Mines had terminated.\n&lt;a href=\"Third%20Era\"&gt;Third Era&lt;/a&gt;.\nDuring the &lt;a href=\"Imperial%20Simulacrum\"&gt;Imperial Simulacrum&lt;/a&gt; from &lt;a href=\"3E%20389\"&gt;3E 389&lt;/a&gt; to &lt;a href=\"3E%20399\"&gt;3E 399&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Emperor\"&gt;Emperor&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Uriel%20Septim%20VII\"&gt;Uriel Septim VII&lt;/a&gt; was imprisoned along with &lt;a href=\"Talin%20Warhaft\"&gt;Talin Warhaft&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;a href=\"Deadlands\"&gt;Deadlands&lt;/a&gt; by &lt;a href=\"Jagar%20Tharn\"&gt;Jagar Tharn&lt;/a&gt;. Tharn planned for months to capture the throne, and he was able to achieve so in the span of ten years. Tharn had a powerful weapon called the &lt;a href=\"Staff%20of%20Chaos\"&gt;Staff of Chaos&lt;/a&gt;, and he split it into nine pieces and scattered them across Tamriel, the staff was the only thing keeping Uriel Septim and Warhaft in &lt;a href=\"Oblivion\"&gt;Oblivion&lt;/a&gt;. A warrior escaped his clutches and traveled all corners of Tamriel to retrieve the missing pieces. The hero was known as the &lt;a href=\"Eternal%20Champion\"&gt;Eternal Champion&lt;/a&gt;, and he assembled the staff and defeated Jagar Tharn at the &lt;a href=\"Imperial%20Palace\"&gt;Imperial Palace&lt;/a&gt;. The Eternal Champion had at one point visited the ruins of the Mines of Khuras in their quest to recover the pieces.\nAfter retrieving the fifth piece of the Staff of Chaos from the &lt;a href=\"Crystal%20Tower\"&gt;Crystal Tower&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;a href=\"Summerset%20Isles\"&gt;Summerset Isles&lt;/a&gt;, the Eternal Champion had traveled to the province of High Rock to claim the next piece, their travels had brought them to the city-state of Camlorn. A member of the &lt;a href=\"Brotherhood%20of%20Seth\"&gt;Brotherhood of Seth&lt;/a&gt; had stolen a map fragment to the &lt;a href=\"Crypt%20of%20Hearts\"&gt;Crypt of Hearts&lt;/a&gt; from their temple, believing that Jagar Tharn was impersonating the Emperor. &lt;a href=\"Halfas%20Varn\"&gt;Halfas Varn&lt;/a&gt; of the Brotherhood had tasked the Eternal Champion with taking down &lt;a href=\"Barnabas\"&gt;Brother Barnabas&lt;/a&gt; at the Mines of Khuras and retrieving the map fragment, in exchange for the piece's next location. In the end, Barnabas was defeated by the Champion, and the map fragment was retrieved. The Champion would then leave for the Crypt of Hearts."}

The sorceress congratulates them for conquering the Fifth Piece from the ruins of &lt;a href=\"Crystal%20Tower%20%28Arena%20Location%29\"&gt;Crystal Tower&lt;/a&gt; and warns there are three other pieces yet to be reached. Ria discovered the location of the Sixth Piece traveling among ethereal planes\u2014the dungeon &lt;a href=\"Crypt%20of%20Hearts%20%28Arena%29\"&gt;Crypt of Hearts&lt;/a&gt;.\nCamlorn.\nTalking with people about the Crypt of Hearts will eventually direct the Eternal Champion to the city of &lt;a href=\"Camlorn%20%28Arena%29\"&gt;Camlorn&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"High%20Rock%20%28Arena%29\"&gt;High Rock&lt;/a&gt;. The citizens of the city will advise that the Champion to go to a local temple, the Brotherhood of Seth. The citizens of Camlorn can also give directions to the temple if the Champion does not know where it is.\nInside the temple, the Senior Brother Halfas Varn will greet the Eternal Champion, and further interactions indicate that he seems to already know about the quest to discover the Crypt of Hearts. The Priest says that one of the monks, &lt;a href=\"Brother%20Barnabas%20of%20Thetis\"&gt;Brother Barnabas of Thetis&lt;/a&gt;, went crazy thinking that, \"The Emperor was captured and only an item called Staff of Chaos could free him.\" Not believing their brother, the monks did not pay any attention to his warnings. However, Barnabas recently assassinated Brother Martinus and stole a Map Fragment which contains a code to decipher the location of the Crypt of Hearts. Halfas theorizes that his Brother traveled to the &lt;a href=\"Mines%20of%20Khuras\"&gt;Mines of Khuras&lt;/a&gt;, a dangerous dungeon, and certainly perished there. The Senior Brother then asks the Eternal Champion to recover the fragment from the Mines and in return he will reveal the location of the Crypt of Hearts.\nAfter receiving a positive reply, the Senior Brother will then mark the Mines of Khuras on the map.\nMines of Khuras.\nRecommended effects:\nMines of Khuras is a bi-level dungeon and as already said by Halfas, a dangerous location. The First Level is more tricky than the other area, due to its streams of lava, while the Second Level is easier, however there is an abundant presence of abysses. Creatures encountered inside the dungeon include &lt;a href=\"Homonculi\"&gt;Homonculi&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Stone%20Golem\"&gt;Stone Golem&lt;/a&gt;s.\nFirst Level.\nAfter entering Mines of Khuras, there will be two ways to reach the door to the Second Level, which is exactly south of the entrance (\"as seen on the map\"). The way to the left will be flooded with lava, which can be passed safely with the Resist Fire effect, though still dealing damage. The way to the ring will also be flooded with lava, however this lava can be passed without the Resist Fire effect; just by jumping from a platform to another. Still, the Eternal Champion may fail and fall into the lava, easily killing them or removing a great portion of &lt;a href=\"Health%20%28Arena%29\"&gt;Health&lt;/a&gt;.\nAlternatively, a magic user can use the spell &lt;a href=\"Passwall%20%28Arena%29\"&gt;Passwall&lt;/a&gt; to break the walls, reaching the door to the Second Level through a much shorter way. However it is important to remember that the door must be entered through the correct side, otherwise the Eternal Champion will be locked inside the walls.\nRegardless of the way taken, in this level the demoniac Homunculi will again appear against the Eternal Champion, mainly in the First Level. Using Resist Shock is useful when fighting these creatures at long range. Not only the first corridors, but all the First Level is flooded with lava, especially on the northeast area.\nSecond Level.\nThe Second Level is considerably safer than the First, not having streams of lava, but a great number of comparatively inoffensive abysses. &lt;a href=\"Stone%20Golem\"&gt;Stone Golem&lt;/a&gt;s will appear in this area, these are the medium strength golem, between its &lt;a href=\"Ice%20Golem\"&gt;Ice&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Iron%20Golem\"&gt;Iron&lt;/a&gt; relatives. Stone Golems, like the Homunculi, use Shock attacks at long range.\nThe Map Fragment stands inside a room in the southeast area locked by two doors. To reach this room, the Eternal Champion can choose to take either the upper way or the lower way (\"the map on the right shows the location of the Map Fragment, represented by a green marker\"). Close to the Map Fragment, the remains of Brother Barnabas reveal the end of the priest who could not rescue the &lt;a href=\"Uriel%20Septim%20VII\"&gt;Emperor&lt;/a&gt;.\nOnce the Eternal Champion obtained the Map Fragment, they must give it back to Halfas Varn on the Brotherhood of Seth. The Senior Brother fulfills his part of the exchange deciphering the location of Crypt of Hearts and marking it on the map."}

Some veins (e.g. Ebony) respawn sooner, or later than the one month. Each vein, regardless of ore type, will yield three pieces of ore, and at most two precious gems. In rare cases, some entire mines or locations will not respawn their ores at all. All &lt;a href=\"Mines%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;mines&lt;/a&gt; contain at least one type of ore inside, though some have more veins than others.\nQuantity.\nAll ore veins contain three pieces of ore, and possibly some gems. It may seem as though the Dragonborn only receives two ore from each vein because there may only be two messages displayed about ore being received, but three ore are actually received per vein. The sound for receiving an ore still plays on the sixth pickaxe hit, even though a message may not appear. Note: If a precious gem (garnet, ruby, etc.) is received on the sixth hit, the message for the gem is displayed, but not the ore.\nOre.\nThere are nine different types of ore that can be mined in &lt;a href=\"Skyrim\"&gt;Skyrim&lt;/a&gt;.\nOre veins are all across the world of Skyrim from simple mines to the tops of mountains. They can be identified as minable by the different colored striations that stand out in the typical grey rocks that dominate the landscape of Skyrim. Environmental conditions can make it somewhat difficult to spot and identify a minable area. When a vein is mined completely, it will lose the colored striations associated to that mineral type.\nLocations.\nLocations specific to each ore are noted on the pages below:\nOre vein reference.\nEach vein has its own distinctive color and pattern, which disappears after mining is complete, in which case the rock returns to its normal gray color."}

Bruma is known for the predominantly Cyro-Nordic population, which the county seat has embraced wholeheartedly. The architecture emphasizes the northern culture.\nDescription.\nGeography.\nThe County of Bruma is situated in the north, along the Jerall Mountains and around the northern reaches of the &lt;a href=\"Great%20Forest\"&gt;Great Forest&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Nibenay%20Basin\"&gt;Nibenay Basin&lt;/a&gt;. It mainly consists of snowy forests and steep mountain paths. Not many settlements exist in the area. The only notable settlements are the village of &lt;a href=\"Bleaker%27s%20Way\"&gt;Bleaker's Way&lt;/a&gt; which is found off the &lt;a href=\"Silver%20Road\"&gt;Silver Road&lt;/a&gt; between Bruma and the &lt;a href=\"Red%20Ring%20Road\"&gt;Red Ring Road&lt;/a&gt; and the fortress of &lt;a href=\"Cloud%20Ruler%20Temple\"&gt;Cloud Ruler Temple&lt;/a&gt; found deeper in the mountains beyond Bruma's northern gate. Bruma is the first town to be encountered when coming south from Skyrim into Cyrodiil and the area between the two provinces is called the &lt;a href=\"Pale%20Pass\"&gt;Pale Pass&lt;/a&gt;. The Pass starts with the hold of &lt;a href=\"Falkreath\"&gt;Falkreath&lt;/a&gt; in the north and extends to Bruma on the south. Far east from Bruma is the wizard's tower &lt;a href=\"Frostcrag%20Spire\"&gt;Frostcrag Spire&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe walled town of Bruma is built on a somewhat steep hill. The main entrance is the eastern gate which is the terminus of a spur road that connects to the Silver Road. Around the northern wall is a dirt path that leads to the north gate, and subsequently both the Cloud Ruler Temple and the region around &lt;a href=\"Applewatch\"&gt;Applewatch&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href=\"Castle%20Bruma\"&gt;Castle Bruma&lt;/a&gt; is on the highest point of the city, separated by another wall from the rest of Bruma city. Everything between the Castle and East Gate is an ascending hill to the Castle. The upper city has a few businesses and the castle. The lower town contains most of the businesses and homes and is roughly oval shaped. The &lt;a href=\"Great%20Chapel%20of%20Talos\"&gt;Great Chapel of Talos&lt;/a&gt; dominates the southern, lowermost half. \nHistory.\n&lt;a href=\"Second%20Era\"&gt;Second Era&lt;/a&gt;.\nIn &lt;a href=\"2E%20576\"&gt;2E 576&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Varen%20Aquilarios\"&gt;Varen Aquilarios&lt;/a&gt;, the Duke of &lt;a href=\"Chorrol\"&gt;Chorrol&lt;/a&gt; waged war with &lt;a href=\"Emperor%20Leovic\"&gt;Emperor Leovic&lt;/a&gt; of the &lt;a href=\"Longhouse%20Emperors\"&gt;Longhouse Emperors&lt;/a&gt; in the event known as the &lt;a href=\"Colovian%20Revolt\"&gt;Colovian Revolt&lt;/a&gt;. Bruma served as his base of operations, while his forces were able to take the faraway city-state of &lt;a href=\"Leyawiin\"&gt;Leyawiin&lt;/a&gt; and by the command of &lt;a href=\"Sai%20Sahan\"&gt;Sai Sahan&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"Gold%20Coast\"&gt;Gold Coast&lt;/a&gt; was sealed off. As time went on, Leovic's rule dwindled until he was eventually usurped by &lt;a href=\"Count%20Carolus%20Aquilarios\"&gt;Count Carolus Aquilarios&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"2E%20577\"&gt;2E 577&lt;/a&gt;. Bruma, along with the rest of Cyrodiil was inducted into Varen's Empire, but after a year, Varen disappeared amidst an event known as the &lt;a href=\"Soulburst\"&gt;Soulburst&lt;/a&gt;. The &lt;a href=\"Order%20of%20the%20Black%20Worm\"&gt;Order of the Black Worm&lt;/a&gt; then erected &lt;a href=\"Dark%20Anchors\"&gt;Dark Anchors&lt;/a&gt; across Tamriel and one was located in the center of Bruma. This interplanar connection between Bruma and Oblivion led to the city's near destruction and left only the Chapel and the Manor standing.\nDuring the &lt;a href=\"Interregnum\"&gt;Interregnum&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"2E%20582\"&gt;2E 582&lt;/a&gt; Bruma was still in ruins and there were two groups of survivors. One stayed in chapel led by &lt;a href=\"Hjorik\"&gt;Hjorik&lt;/a&gt;, a priest of the Divines and the the other in the Manor, led by &lt;a href=\"Grigerda\"&gt;Grigerda&lt;/a&gt;, a local Nord. During the &lt;a href=\"Alliance%20War\"&gt;Alliance War&lt;/a&gt;, Bruma's ownership depended on who controlled &lt;a href=\"Fort%20Dragonclaw\"&gt;Fort Dragonclaw&lt;/a&gt; directly north of the town. Grigerda sought aid from both the &lt;a href=\"Daggerfall%20Covenant\"&gt;Daggerfall Covenant&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Ebonheart%20Pact\"&gt;Ebonheart Pact&lt;/a&gt; to help fend off the Daedra roaming the streets. Bruma was also one of the three major settlements fought over by the Alliances, with the other two being the towns of &lt;a href=\"Cropsford\"&gt;Cropsford&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Vlastarus\"&gt;Vlastarus&lt;/a&gt;.\n&lt;a href=\"Third%20Era\"&gt;Third Era&lt;/a&gt;.\nDuring the &lt;a href=\"Oblivion%20Crisis\"&gt;Oblivion Crisis&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"3E%20433\"&gt;3E 433&lt;/a&gt;, the County of Bruma was ruled by &lt;a href=\"Countess%20Narina%20Carvain\"&gt;Countess Narina Carvain&lt;/a&gt;, an aficionado of everything related to the &lt;a href=\"Akaviri\"&gt;Akaviri&lt;/a&gt;. Countess Carvain had a vast collection of Akaviri-related items from the &lt;a href=\"First%20Akaviri%20Invasion\"&gt;First Akaviri Invasion&lt;/a&gt;, specifically the &lt;a href=\"Battle%20of%20Pale%20Pass\"&gt;Battle of Pale Pass&lt;/a&gt;, near Bruma. She knew of the ruins of &lt;a href=\"Fort%20Pale%20Pass\"&gt;Fort Pale Pass&lt;/a&gt;, but it was lost deep within the vales of the Jerall Mountains. So, Carvain tasked the &lt;a href=\"Hero%20of%20Kvatch\"&gt;Hero of Kvatch&lt;/a&gt; with acquiring the &lt;a href=\"Draconian%20Madstone\"&gt;Draconian Madstone&lt;/a&gt; from the Fort. The Madstone was brought to Countess and news of the Pale Pass discovery had spread across the province. This lead to the reopening of Pale Pass and it became the main supply line between Cyrodiil and Skyrim after that.\nLike other cities at the same time, an &lt;a href=\"Oblivion%20Gate%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;Oblivion Gate&lt;/a&gt; had opened on the outskirts of East Bruma. When it had appeared, &lt;a href=\"Burd\"&gt;Captain Burd&lt;/a&gt; had sought the help of &lt;a href=\"the%20Blades\"&gt;the Blades&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Cloud%20Ruler%20Temple\"&gt;Cloud Ruler Temple&lt;/a&gt;. In response, &lt;a href=\"Jauffre%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;Jauffre&lt;/a&gt; sent the Hero to destroy the gate. The gate was banished, but another, and much stronger portal, was going to appear. To prepare, the Hero of Kvatch traveled to the other seven counties of Cyrodiil, asking for aid. The &lt;a href=\"Battle%20of%20Bruma\"&gt;Battle of Bruma&lt;/a&gt; was one of the largest battles, as a Great Gate had opened in a clearing near the Silver Road. The Hero of Kvatch delved deep into the Gate, bypassing the Siege Crawler and acquiring the &lt;a href=\"Sigil%20Stone\"&gt;Sigil Stone&lt;/a&gt;. Many warriors were lost, but Bruma was saved, and a statue of the Savior of Bruma was erected near the Castle. The Sigil Stone from the battle was then used to enter &lt;a href=\"Gaiar%20Alata\"&gt;Gaiar Alata&lt;/a&gt; where the Hero defeated &lt;a href=\"Mankar%20Camoran\"&gt;Mankar Camoran&lt;/a&gt;.\n&lt;a href=\"Fourth%20Era\"&gt;Fourth Era&lt;/a&gt;.\nBruma was one of the only settlements in Cyrodiil that was not attacked by the &lt;a href=\"Third%20Aldmeri%20Dominion\"&gt;Third Aldmeri Dominion&lt;/a&gt; during the &lt;a href=\"Great%20War\"&gt;Great War&lt;/a&gt;. The area around Bruma and the Silver Road was the northern supply route for the Imperial Legion, who were facing the Dominion on various fronts. In &lt;a href=\"4E%20173\"&gt;4E 173&lt;/a&gt;, when the Dominion were surrounded the &lt;a href=\"Imperial%20City\"&gt;Imperial City&lt;/a&gt; on all other fronts, the Silver Road was the only line remaining. In &lt;a href=\"4E%20174\"&gt;4E 174&lt;/a&gt;, Bruma was the staging ground for the retaking of the Imperial City. &lt;a href=\"Titus%20Mede%20II\"&gt;Titus Mede II&lt;/a&gt; came down from Bruma with &lt;a href=\"General%20Decianus\"&gt;General Decianus'&lt;/a&gt; forces from the west and &lt;a href=\"General%20Jonna\"&gt;General Jonna's&lt;/a&gt; forces from the east. Wielding &lt;a href=\"Goldbrand\"&gt;Goldbrand&lt;/a&gt;, Titus was able to retake the Imperial City and win the war at the &lt;a href=\"Battle%20of%20the%20Red%20Ring\"&gt;Battle of the Red Ring&lt;/a&gt;."}
{"id": "2326", "revid": "26893431", "url": "https://elderscrolls.fandom.com/wiki?curid=2326", "title": "Bruma (Oblivion)", "text": "Bruma is the northernmost city in the province of &lt;a href=\"Cyrodiil\"&gt;Cyrodiil&lt;/a&gt;, located in the &lt;a href=\"Jerall%20Mountains\"&gt;Jerall Mountains&lt;/a&gt; along the border to &lt;a href=\"Skyrim\"&gt;Skyrim&lt;/a&gt;, and is the county seat for &lt;a href=\"County%20Bruma\"&gt;County Bruma&lt;/a&gt;. Bruma's northern latitude, combined with its high altitude, results in a much different climate than that of the other populated areas of the province. The city is perpetually covered in snow, with clear, sunny days a rarity. The city has adapted to the climate by using the &lt;a href=\"Nords%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;Nordic&lt;/a&gt; way of life.\nBackground.\nDue to Bruma's proximity to Skyrim it is populated primarily by Nords, both immigrants from Skyrim itself, and Cyrodiilic citizens longing for a place more like their ancient home. The non-Nordic people of Bruma tend to keep to their Nibenean ways, though most of the Cyrodiilic Nords maintain true to the customs of Skyrim. The city's culture is similar to that of &lt;a href=\"Solstheim\"&gt;Solstheim&lt;/a&gt;, an island near &lt;a href=\"Morrowind\"&gt;Morrowind&lt;/a&gt; that is part of Skyrim, but heavily populated by &lt;a href=\"Imperials\"&gt;Imperials&lt;/a&gt;. Given the Nordic penchant for battle, and their legends linking &lt;a href=\"Tiber%20Septim\"&gt;Tiber Septim&lt;/a&gt; to the ancient &lt;a href=\"Greybeards\"&gt;Greybeards&lt;/a&gt;, it is not surprising that Bruma's patron saint is &lt;a href=\"Talos\"&gt;Talos&lt;/a&gt;, the divine aspect of Tiber Septim.\nThe city is built directly into the side of the Jerall Mountain peaks, with the main gate at the eastern end, and &lt;a href=\"Castle%20Bruma\"&gt;Castle Bruma&lt;/a&gt; at the westernmost point. The northern half of the city is built onto four man-made steps leading up to the castle walls, which is where the guild halls and shops are located. The southern portion consists of a single road, containing the bulk of the residences, which follows a naturally sloping semicircle from west to east. The city's most prominent feature, the &lt;a href=\"Great%20Chapel%20of%20Talos\"&gt;Great Chapel of Talos&lt;/a&gt;, lies at the heart of this semicircle, and is the first sight a visitor will see upon entering Bruma's main gate.\nFor most details about this City, see Bruma's volume in &lt;a href=\"Alessia%20Ottus\"&gt;Alessia Ottus&lt;/a&gt;'s guidebook series, \"&lt;a href=\"Guide%20to%20Bruma\"&gt;Guide to Bruma&lt;/a&gt;\".\nThings of note.\nThieves Guild fence.\n&lt;a href=\"Ongar\"&gt;Ongar&lt;/a&gt;, the first &lt;a href=\"Fence%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;fence&lt;/a&gt; for the &lt;a href=\"Thieves%20Guild%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;Thieves Guild&lt;/a&gt;, lives in this city.\nDark Brotherhood clothing.\n&lt;a href=\"J%27Ghasta%27s%20House\"&gt;J'Ghasta's House&lt;/a&gt; has a &lt;a href=\"Black%20Hand%20Hood\"&gt;Black Hand Hood&lt;/a&gt; and a &lt;a href=\"Black%20Hand%20Robe%20%28Clothing%20piece%29\"&gt;Black Hand Robe&lt;/a&gt; worn exclusively by members of the &lt;a href=\"Dark%20Brotherhood%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;Dark Brotherhood&lt;/a&gt;, which raises your &lt;a href=\"Sneak%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;Sneak&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Marksman%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;Marksman&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Illusion%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;Illusion&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Blade\"&gt;Blade&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Speechcraft%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;Speechcraft&lt;/a&gt; by 4 and 11 points respectively. The equipment is protected by a Very Hard &lt;a href=\"Lock%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;lock&lt;/a&gt; on a keg in the lower level. There is also a \"Secret Training Room\" hidden door in the corner of the lower level under some fabric swaths. There are some practice dummies here and light reading is available (increase &lt;a href=\"Hand-to-Hand%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;hand-to-hand&lt;/a&gt;).\nStatue of the Hero.\nAfter completing the \"&lt;a href=\"Great%20Gate\"&gt;Great Gate&lt;/a&gt;\" quest, a statue of the player character will be erected near the north gate to the Jerall Mountains. The statue features the equipment that the game considers the best of what the Hero had in their inventory during the quest.\nDescription.\nBruma is understood to be a &lt;a href=\"Nibenese\"&gt;Nibenese&lt;/a&gt; county, but in truth it is more &lt;a href=\"Nord\"&gt;Nord&lt;/a&gt; than Nibenese, on account of its close proximity to the &lt;a href=\"Skyrim\"&gt;Skyrim&lt;/a&gt; border, and on account of the terrible cold and discomfort of its location high in the &lt;a href=\"Jerall%20Mountains\"&gt;Jerall Mountains&lt;/a&gt;. Bruma is always cold and covered with snow, with braziers kept burning in every quarter to prevent the citizens from freezing to death. Everything is built from wood since trees are so plentiful in the forests of the Jeralls, and even rich men live here in dark wooden cabins.\nArchitecture.\nUnlike most other cities, there is very little diversity among the architecture of Bruma. There is no prominent aristocratic or commercial region to speak of. Almost all of the buildings, from the guild halls down to the single-person residences, are sturdy wooden buildings built on top of a thick granite base. Most houses are built with the top story at ground level, as to maintain heat in the living areas. The only notable difference between the high-end houses and the lower-end ones are the presence of a second story, and in some cases, a basement. Though the buildings are constructed similar to the log cabins of the Skyrim frontier, they are extremely well-built, and generally sport elaborate doors and external support beams, decorated all over with Nordic carvings. There is very little decorative architecture about Bruma apart from the buildings themselves; in particular, the climate is far too harsh to support parks, trees, ponds, or other natural features found in other cities. Bruma (influenced by Nords) and &lt;a href=\"Cheydinhal%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;Cheydinhal&lt;/a&gt; (influenced by Dark Elves) are the two cities most affected by foreigners in Cyrodiil.\nCount and countess.\nCountess &lt;a href=\"Narina%20Carvain\"&gt;Narina Carvain&lt;/a&gt; is a &lt;a href=\"Nibenese\"&gt;Nibenean&lt;/a&gt; Heartlander, though she can be just as cold and brusque as her city. A dutiful chapel-goer and a respected ruler; she is a cunning, ruthless negotiator and has a reputation for sharp dealing and treachery, as well as a noted scholar and collector of Akaviri artefacts. She runs the county efficiently and the region is well-ordered. The Countess makes sure that Bruma has a well trained and aggressive town watch. To lead the town watch she has hired a Nord named &lt;a href=\"Burd\"&gt;Burd&lt;/a&gt; as Captain of the Guard.\nLayout.\n&lt;a href=\"Castle%20Bruma\"&gt;Castle Bruma&lt;/a&gt; is cold and drafty, carelessly decorated, and dark with soot from the perpetually burning braziers. The smell of smoke and cinders is overpowering. The high ceilings are grand, but impossible to heat. The ancient layers of soot and filth encrusting the stonework makes it difficult to appreciate the exceptional stonecarving. Except in its stonework and grand scale, the castle is like the log cabins of the people: cold, dark, drafty and dirty.\nAccess to the castle is through a gate west from the town into a courtyard. The shops, inns, and guilds are located in the north, either on the western terrace near the castle gate, or below the terrace, north of the chapel. The chapel is the central feature of southern Bruma, with houses ranged along the inside of the walls to the east and south.\nShops, inns, and guilds.\nBruma has the standard &lt;a href=\"Bruma%20Fighters%20Guild\"&gt;Fighters Guild hall&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Bruma%20Mages%20Guild\"&gt;Mages Guild hall&lt;/a&gt;, both located on the second tier, where guild members can find rest and training. However, these are very small guild halls, with only a handful of members in each guild and only apprentice-level trainers. However the Bruma Mages Guild is a good starting point for mage-type characters since the guild members sell spells in every school, with a wide variety of effects. Of particular note is the &lt;a href=\"Summon%20Dremora%20Lord\"&gt;Summon Dremora Lord&lt;/a&gt; which cannot be purchased anywhere else.\nBruma is home to two taverns, both of which offer food, drink and lodging:\nBruma's commercial options are somewhat limited, though one can take advantage of the Nords' world-renowned skill at forging weapons and armor. The following shops are available:\nBruma is home to a Thieves Guild Fence, &lt;a href=\"Ongar%20the%20World-Weary\"&gt;Ongar the World-Weary&lt;/a&gt;, who can be found in &lt;a href=\"Olav%27s%20Tap%20and%20Tack\"&gt;Olav's Tap and Tack&lt;/a&gt; when not in his own house.\nOther points of interest.\nBruma is, in general, a very utilitarian city. There is not much in the way of sightseeing or tourism, so there is very little of interest to those without specific business in the city.\nThe city boasts an impressive chapel, the &lt;a href=\"Great%20Chapel%20of%20Talos\"&gt;Great Chapel of Talos&lt;/a&gt;, as its central feature.\nThe most interesting features of Bruma actually appear outside the city, to the north. The Emperor's private guard force, the &lt;a href=\"Blades%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;Blades&lt;/a&gt;, have occupied a large &lt;a href=\"Akaviri\"&gt;Akaviri&lt;/a&gt; fortress north of Bruma, called &lt;a href=\"Cloud%20Ruler%20Temple%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;Cloud Ruler Temple&lt;/a&gt;. In addition, somewhere in the &lt;a href=\"Jerall%20Mountains\"&gt;Jerall Mountains&lt;/a&gt; is the infamous &lt;a href=\"Pale%20Pass\"&gt;Pale Pass&lt;/a&gt;, where &lt;a href=\"Reman%20Cyrodiil\"&gt;Emperor Reman I&lt;/a&gt; finally defeated the Akaviri invaders towards the end of the &lt;a href=\"First%20Era\"&gt;First Era&lt;/a&gt;.\nThere is a &lt;a href=\"Houses%20%28Oblivion%29%23Obtaining%20a%20house\"&gt;house&lt;/a&gt; for sale in Bruma costing 10,000 .\nCharacters.\nBruma has few residents of any real note, apart from the merchants themselves:\nThere is a single, unoccupied &lt;a href=\"My%20Bruma%20House\"&gt;house&lt;/a&gt; for sale on the eastern side of town.\nQuests.\nThe following are the only quests that specifically start in the city:"}

He tells the Hero the Bruma Guard needs help to close the &lt;a href=\"Oblivion%20Gate%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;Oblivion Gate&lt;/a&gt; located just outside the city, as they have had experience with closing them before. They must show the Guards how to shut it down so they will know how to do it if any more Gates will open after closing this one.\nBruma.\nTravel to Bruma and find Captain &lt;a href=\"Burd\"&gt;Burd&lt;/a&gt; outside the east gate. He has gathered his men and they are looking at the Oblivion Gate. The Captain will first tell the Hero to wait as he wants to have a minute with his men. He informs them on what to do, it will be only him, the Hero and a few of the Guards going &lt;a href=\"Planes%20of%20Oblivion%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;inside&lt;/a&gt; the Gate and the rest should stay and kill anything that comes out from it.\nHe asks the Hero if they are ready and then he charges into the Gate. There are a few &lt;a href=\"Daedra\"&gt;Daedra&lt;/a&gt; coming out of the Gate. Either help the Guards to kill them or go through the Gate after the Captain.\nExpected walkthrough.\nOblivion Gate.\nOnce inside try and help the Guards stay alive as long as possible, replenish their health by waiting an hour when the area is clear as they can give the Daedra extra damage if needed. Captain Burd is an essential character so he can be knocked unconscious but heal himself when he comes to.\nAfter disposing of the Daedra in the first attack, follow the path around clockwise. Go as far north as one can and then begin heading south and west towards the center of the island and the citadel. There will be more Daedra coming along on the way and beware of the spinning defense turrets shooting fireballs when nearby.\nFury Spike.\nWhen reaching the High Tower, enter the Fury Spike and find the way to the Rending Halls. Follow the path and then take the east exit up again until as high as one can go, then take the central exit back to the Fury Spike. The exit one level below also leads into the Fury Spike but is a dead end. Ascend the side walls and exit into the Corridors of Dark Salvation.\nWhen inside the corridors take either path and follow it up, perform a u-turn and then up again to the upper level which has another exit to the Fury Spike where the lava is flowing upward. Walk up the side ramps to the locked door to the Sigillum Sanguis. If the &lt;a href=\"Sigil%20Keeper%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;Sigil Keeper&lt;/a&gt; is near he will attack and after he is killed take the Sigil Key from him to open the door. Otherwise, simply pick the lock.\nSigillum Sanguis.\nOnce inside the circular chamber, defeat the Daedra with the help of the Captain and proceed up the stairs on either side. More Daedra will attack then continue up either ramp to the top where the &lt;a href=\"Sigil%20Stone%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;Sigil Stone&lt;/a&gt; is. Wait for the Captain to arrive so he can see them take the Sigil Stone, which will transport them back outside Bruma.\nAlternative walkthrough.\nAt the gate, tell Burd to wait and then solo the Oblivion region as described above or simply ignore him altogether and enter the gate. This approach is preferable for a stealth Hero or those that want to be more leisurely as Burd and company will blindly charge ahead at all times inside Oblivion. It also saves the lives of all of the guards, since none of them enter the gate.\nWhen the Hero gets to the Sigil Stone, it will tell them to go get Burd, but even a few steps away, it glitches and believes Burd is there. If the Hero waits for a moment or two, Burd will be spawned inside the tower and come running up one of the ramps. Return to the Stone, activate it and return to &lt;a href=\"Nirn\"&gt;Nirn&lt;/a&gt;. There may be some light cleanup to do as Burd and his men fight off a few Daedra that exited the gate.\nOutside Bruma.\nUpon returning outside Bruma, Captain Burd will thank the Hero for the help and after asking him if he needs more help he says he will now be able to close any other Gates that will open. He addresses his men and then they walk off.\nHead back to Jauffre and Martin and let them know about the success of closing the Gate."}

Being a devout follower of &lt;a href=\"Dibella\"&gt;Dibella&lt;/a&gt; he prayed to her for something that would allow him to express himself once more. She heard his plea, and gifted him with the Brush of Truepaint.\nSeveral years later he passed the brush to his son, &lt;a href=\"Rythe%20Lythandas\"&gt;Rythe Lythandas&lt;/a&gt;, who used it to become one of &lt;a href=\"Tamriel\"&gt;Tamriel&lt;/a&gt;'s best painters.

When Rythe awoke, he realized that the only way out of the painted world was to fight past all six Trolls and retrieve the brush. Knowing he\u00a0was not a warrior,\u00a0he awaited his rescue.\nInteractions.\n&lt;a href=\"A%20Brush%20With%20Death%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;A Brush With Death&lt;/a&gt;.\nListening to rumors around &lt;a href=\"Cheydinhal%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;Cheydinhal&lt;/a&gt; will lead to hearing of the disappearance of Rythe Lythandas, a famous painter, and that his wife &lt;a href=\"Tivela%20Lythandas\"&gt;Tivela&lt;/a&gt; is grieving and looking for help with finding her husband. The &lt;a href=\"Hero%20of%20Kvatch\"&gt;Hero&lt;/a&gt; may have entered the painting to retrieve the Brush of Truepaint and Rythe Lythandas, slaying all six Painted Trolls\u00a0with the help of six\u00a0bottles\u00a0of Turpentine."}

You've never gone hungry a day in your life, Erikur!\"\nElisif: \"And what would my impetuous Thane Bryling suggest, instead?\"\nBryling: \"\"Simple. Let the Empire fight its own war, with its own funds, and without hijacking our supplies and soldiers. Let &lt;a href=\"Haafingar\"&gt;Haafingar&lt;/a&gt; rebuild.\"\"\nErikur: \"My lady... Surely you're not that na\u00efve. Such foolishness would only leave us defenseless. The rebels would storm the palace in an afternoon.\"\nBryling: \"\"The &lt;a href=\"Stormcloaks\"&gt;Stormcloaks&lt;/a&gt; only rebel because the Empire uses Skyrim as its personal larder. The more they take, the more support the rebels gain!\"\nElisif: \"That is quite enough. Perhaps I will raise these issues when I have an audience with &lt;a href=\"General%20Tullius%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;General Tullius&lt;/a&gt;.\"\"\nElisif: \"Thane Bryling, what do you have to report about the state of Haafingar's defenses?\"\nBryling: \"The news is the same as it's been for the rest of the war, your grace. Our borders are secure, but at the cost of the guards for our towns and roads.\"\nErikur: \"I don't see any reason why we'd need them. As long as those dogs stay outside of our borders, we're fine.\"\nBryling: \"The Stormcloaks are far from the only threat to the hold. The roads are beset by bandits and beasts... and now there's even talk of bloody dragons.\"\nErikur: \"My dear Bryling. Barring any... fancy and folly... the good people of Haafingar are surely capable of dealing with the odd highwayman or stray dog.\"\nBryling: \"Trouble on the roads and cities means less commerce. Less commerce means less money and more starving people. And that means more crime.\"\nErikur: \"Humph. That's only a problem for people who can't afford to hire their own security.\"\nElisif: \"\"That may well be our only answer. I will empower my &lt;a href=\"Steward\"&gt;Steward&lt;/a&gt; to seek out capable individuals to secure Haafingar. Thank you, my Thanes.\"\"\nFalk Firebeard.\nBryling: \"\"There's something that's been troubling me, &lt;a href=\"Falk%20Firebeard\"&gt;Falk&lt;/a&gt;. I am hesitant to share it, but I feel that I must.\"\"\nFalk: \"Speak your mind, Bryling. You're among friends here.\"\nBryling: \"\"You know that I support the Empire, as we all do. However, I fear General Tullius is underestimating the Stormcloaks. Too often the general has lost good soldiers because he did not take &lt;a href=\"Ulfric%20Stormcloak%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Ulfric&lt;/a&gt; and his men seriously. If this continues, and the worst comes to pass, Solitude will pay the price. The Empire is headquartered here, after all.\"\"\nFalk: \"We don't have the luxury of hanging back to see who wins before choosing our friends, Bryling. You know this. And besides, no Nord with a shred of honor would consider it. We're no cowards. Have faith, Bryling. When this war is over and Ulfric is dead, you'll see that you were jumping at shadows, and nothing more.\"\nBryling: \"Falk, you shouldn't have come. You know what'd happen if people found out about us.\"\nFalk: \"I know, my lady. I just needed to see you outside of court, away from all of the politics.\"\nBryling: \"I'm serious. If Erikur knew about us, he'd force you to resign from your position. And without you, he'd have the Jarl bent around his little finger.\"\nFalk: \"You're right, of course. But when this war is over, I'll gladly resign and we can stop sneaking around like this.\"\nBryling: \"One more reason to pray for the fighting to end then, my love.\"\nFalk Firebeard &amp; Sybille Stentor.\nFalk: \"It's nearly time to collect taxes on your properties here in the city, Bryling. We'll need to visit each home for an assessment.\"\nBryling: \"Is it that time again already? Very well, let's meet this evening and make the arrangements.\"\n&lt;a href=\"Sybille%20Stentor\"&gt;Sybille&lt;/a&gt;: \"\"Oh, well done. Very subtle.\"&lt;br &gt;\nBryling: \"\"I beg your pardon?\"&lt;br &gt;\nSybille: \"\"Oh, I'm sorry, did I imply that you'd be meeting for purposes other than court business? You must forgive me.\"&lt;br &gt;\nFalk: \"\"Hold your tongue, wizard, or you're likely to lose it.\"&lt;br &gt;\nSybille: \"\"I should very much like to see you try it, my dear steward.\"&lt;br &gt;\nBryling: \"Stop it, both of you. You're acting like children.\"\nIrnskar Ironhand.\nBryling: \"\"What news have you heard from the war, &lt;a href=\"Irnskar%20Ironhand\"&gt;Irnskar&lt;/a&gt;?\"\"\nIrnskar: \"You won't like it, my lady.\"\nBryling: \"I'm well aware that I won't like it. But it's my duty to keep my people safe. Tell me.\"\nIrnskar: \"Possession of the holds change on an almost daily basis, but I can report that Haafingar is still secure. Your people are safe.\"\nBryling: \"I'm not just talking about my subjects. I'm talking about my people: the proud Nords of Skyrim.\"\nIrnskar: \"I told you you wouldn't like the news.\"\nIrnskar: \"\"My lady, I'm pleased to inform you that you have a new gown for court, specially tailored by madame &lt;a href=\"Endarie%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Endarie&lt;/a&gt;.\"\"\nBryling: \"Really? How did we afford that? Besides, I like the gown I already have.\"\nIrnskar: \"Madame Endarie insisted. She made it free of charge, in honor of your lenience about last month's rent discrepancies.\"\nBryling: \"That was suspiciously nice of her. I thought she hated everyone.\"\nIrnskar: \"She does, my lady. But apparently, she hates you just a little less than the others.\""}

While everyone is distracted, the Dragonborn must break into the stall belonging to the Argonian jeweler &lt;a href=\"Madesi\"&gt;Madesi&lt;/a&gt;, steal &lt;a href=\"Madesi%27s%20Silver%20Ring\"&gt;his ring&lt;/a&gt;, and place it into the Dunmer merchant &lt;a href=\"Brand-Shei\"&gt;Brand-Shei&lt;/a&gt;'s pocket without getting caught.

Until a new Guild Master is chosen, the decision falls to you.\"\nBrynjolf: \"Aye, lass... and I've come to a decision. Mercer Frey tried to kill both of you, he betrayed the Guild, murdered Gallus and made us question our future. He needs to die.\"\nKarliah: \"We have to be very careful, Brynjolf. Mercer is a Nightingale, an Agent of Nocturnal.\"\nBrynjolf: \"Then it's all true... everything I heard in the stories. The Nightingales, their allegiance to Nocturnal and the Twilight Sepulcher.\"\nKarliah: \"Yes. That's why we need to prepare ourselves and meet Mercer on equal footing. Just outside of Riften, beyond the Southeast Gate is a small path cut up the mountainside. At the end of that path is a clearing and an old standing stone. I'd ask you both meet me there.\"\nBrynjolf: \"So, this is Nightingale Hall. I heard about this place when I joined the Guild, but I never believed it existed.\"\nKarliah: \"The assumption that the Nightingales were just a myth was seeded within the Guild on purpose. It helped avert attention from our true nature. What's wrong, Brynjolf? I can almost hear your brow furrowing.\"\nBrynjolf: \"I'm trying to understand why I'm here, lass. I'm no priest, and I'm certainly not religious. Why pick me?\"\nKarliah: \"This isn't about religion, Brynjolf... it's business. This is Nightingale Hall. You're the first of the uninitiated to set foot inside in over a century. Now, if you'll both proceed to the armory to don your Nightingale Armor, we can begin the Oath.\"\nBrynjolf: \"Okay, lass. We've got these getups on... now what?\"\nKarliah: \"Beyond this gate is the first step in becoming a Nightingale.\"\nBrynjolf: \"Woah there, lass. I appreciate the armor, but becoming a Nightingale? That was never discussed.\"\nKarliah: \"To hold any hope of defeating Mercer, we must have Nocturnal at our backs. If she's to accept you as one of her own, an arrangement must be struck.\"\nBrynjolf: \"What sort of arrangement? I need to know the terms.\"\nKarliah: \"The terms are quite simple, Brynjolf. Nocturnal will allow you to become a Nightingale and use your abilities for whatever you wish. And in return, both in life and in death, you must serve as a guardian of the Twilight Sepulcher.\"\nBrynjolf: \"Aye, there's always a catch. But at this point, I suppose there isn't much to lose. If it means the end of Mercer Frey, you can count me in.\"\n&lt;a href=\"Blindsighted\"&gt;Blindsighted&lt;/a&gt;.\nKarliah: \"Wait a moment... what's that? It's Mercer! Look... down there!\"\nBrynjolf: \"I'm on it, lass. Damn it! There's no way through.\"\nKarliah: \"He's toying with us. He wants us to follow.\"\nBrynjolf: \"Aye, lass... and we'll be ready for him. Let's keep moving.\"\nBrynjolf: \"Look at the size of this place. Have you ever seen anything like it in your life, lass?\"\nKarliah: \"Can't say that I have. Imagine the riches hidden within these walls.\"\nBrynjolf: \"So this is what we heard. The entire tower collapsed.\"\nKarliah: \"The only reason to do that would be to block pursuit. It must be Mercer. We'll have to find another way around.\"\nBrynjolf: \"Mercer was able to knock this thing down? Gods...\"\nKarliah: \"It's the Key, Brynjolf. In his hands, there's no telling what he's capable of.\"\nKarliah: \"Mercer must have triggered these pistons. We're going to have to search for a way to open them.\"\nBrynjolf: \"I'll bet my last septim that there's a mechanism around here somewhere.\"\nBrynjolf: \"Shor's Bones! Look at that monstrosity.\"\nKarliah: \"It's a Dwarven Centurion. Very tough and very deadly.\"\nBrynjolf: \"We can take the beast on or sneak around. It's your call, . We're right behind you.\"\nBrynjolf: \"The stench... this place reeks of Falmer.\"\nKarliah: \"This must be their hive. We'll have to keep silent if we want to avoid drawing their attention.\"\nKarliah: \"There's a mass of the Falmer in this chamber. We can sneak through or take them down... I don't care. As long as we get to Mercer.\"\nBrynjolf: \"Aye. Whatever want to do, we're with you.\"\nKarliah: \"He's close. I'm certain of it. We must prepare ourselves.\"\nBrynjolf: \"Then this is it. We do this for Gallus and for the Guild.\"\nKarliah: \"He's here and he hasn't seen us yet. Brynjolf, watch the door.\"\nBrynjolf: \"Aye, lass. Nothing's getting by me.\"\nKarliah: \"Climb down that ledge and see if you can...\"\nMercer: \"Karliah, when will you learn you can't get the drop on me?\"\nMercer: \"Karliah, I'll deal with you after I rid myself of your irksome companions. In the meantime, perhaps you and Brynjolf should get better acquainted.\"\nBrynjolf: \"What's... what's happening... I can't stop myself.\"\nKarliah: \"Damn you, Mercer! Fight it, Brynjolf... he's taken control of you!\"\nBrynjolf: \"I'm sorry lass, I... I can't...\"\nKarliah: \"Damn! This place is coming down! Quick, get the Skeleton Key and the Eye and lets get out of here!\"\nBrynjolf: \"No luck there, lass. Something must have fallen on the other side of the door because it isn't moving!\"\nKarliah: \"We have to find another way out of here before the place fills with water!\"\n&lt;a href=\"Under%20New%20Management\"&gt;Under New Management&lt;/a&gt;.\nBrynjolf: \"\"Look, I've never been good at these things, so I'm just going to keep it short. Being Guild Master means more than just getting a cut of all the loot, it's about being a leader and keeping this rabble in order. With that in mind, I propose that the position of Guild Master should be . &lt;a href=\"Delvin%20Mallory%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Delvin&lt;/a&gt;?\"\"\nDelvin: \"Agreed.\"\nBrynjolf: \"\"&lt;a href=\"Vex\"&gt;Vex&lt;/a&gt;?\"\"\nVex: \"Sure, why not.\"\nBrynjolf: \"Karliah?\"\nKarliah: \"Absolutely.\"\nBrynjolf: \"Everyone is in agreement, so all I can do now is name Guild Master and wish you good fortune and long life. Now everyone get back to work.\""}

It is the largest ruin in the game. The entire ruin is inaccessible unless the quest \"&lt;a href=\"The%20Only%20Cure\"&gt;The Only Cure&lt;/a&gt;\" has been started.\nBackground.\nAlthough &lt;a href=\"Dwemer\"&gt;Dwemer&lt;/a&gt; in origin and still harboring the creations of its original inhabitants, the &lt;a href=\"Dwarven%20Automaton\"&gt;Dwarven Automaton&lt;/a&gt; guardians, the site now primarily serves as the sanctum to &lt;a href=\"Peryite\"&gt;Peryite's&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Afflicted\"&gt;Afflicted&lt;/a&gt; and their leader, &lt;a href=\"Orchendor\"&gt;Orchendor&lt;/a&gt;. The exterior appears much like any other &lt;a href=\"Dwemer%20Ruins%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Dwemer Ruin&lt;/a&gt; in Skyrim and is guarded by two of the Afflicted.\nWalkthrough.\nThe exterior buildings cascade down towards a recessed rock face, where the entrance to the ruins' interior can be found. There are two levers near the entrance. The lever by the stairs activates a trap and the lever by the door lowers the bars which block the entrance.\nBeyond the lever-controlled gate is a door that leads to another room. On the left (south) side are two chests with leveled loot. Straight ahead (west) is the door to the Bthardamz Upper District, the first part of the interior.\nThe Bthardamz Interior is a winding collection of districts and small connecting areas. There are three major districts, the Upper and Lower Districts and the main Arcanex. Three much smaller areas serve as thoroughfares or small alcoves, the Workshop, Dwelling and Study.\nBthardamz Upper District.\nThis is perhaps the largest section of Bthardamz and appears to function as the living quarters for &lt;a href=\"Peryite\"&gt;Peryite's&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Afflicted\"&gt;Afflicted&lt;/a&gt;. Upon entering, the Dragonborn will see &lt;a href=\"Dwemer\"&gt;Dwemer&lt;/a&gt; pots that have been filled with a curious green liquid, not unlike the vomit that spews forth from the Afflicted themselves. The district has a heavy population of Afflicted mages, fighters, and &lt;a href=\"archer\"&gt;archer&lt;/a&gt;s that patrol the ruins. There are several &lt;a href=\"Containers%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;chests&lt;/a&gt; scattered throughout the district, but approach with care, as one may set loose a few leveled &lt;a href=\"Dwarven%20Sphere%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Dwarven Spheres&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"Dwarven%20Spider%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;spiders&lt;/a&gt;. The district is separated into two distinct areas and is bisected by the Bthardamz Workshop.\nThe first area of the Upper District is quite straightforward. There's a chest on one of the tables in the first room. Immediately after turning right (north), there is an intersection. Straight ahead is a novice-locked gate, while an open door leads to the left. The door leads to sleeping quarters of the Afflicted. The couple of Afflicted residing in these can be bypassed by going through the locked gate, or if the Dragonborn has a high Sneak skill, they can assassinate them, quietly. Beyond the gate are more Dwemer pots, and the hall turns left (west). An open door to the right (north) leads to a room with an adept-locked gate with a chest behind it.\nBack in the hall, the hallway turns right (north), descends a ramp and finally opens up to a large hall. Entering the room, one of the first large chambers, one can overhear a prayer circle of three Afflicted calling out to their patron Peryite.\nA hallway to the left (west) leads to the next large hall, which contains four Afflicted, some of which are patrolling. There are two spiral ramps and two sets of stairs leading up from this room. The stairs both lead to the same ledge overlooking the room, with a lever in the center that opens a spike gate on the other side. The ramps both lead to the gate. Near the bottom of the left (south) ramp going up to the next room is a &lt;a href=\"gold%20ore%20vein\"&gt;gold ore vein&lt;/a&gt;, on the floor of the rocky area to the right of the ramp. Beyond the gate is a short passageway (south southwest) that leads to another room with a walkway to the left (east southeast). At the end of the walkway, it is possible to make a right-hand U-turn and head down to an area where the only notable item is a chest on the wall.\nThrough the next door, the hallway slopes down to the east and comes to an intersection. Straight ahead is a dead-end room with a couple of Dwarven Spheres and a wall chest. The Spheres will appear when the chest is approached. To the right (south) of the intersection the hallway slopes down to another Afflicted and a helicopter blade trap which is activated by the pressure plate in front of the blades' channel. At the bottom of the ramp is a closed but unlocked gate. Behind the gate, the path slopes further down to an area with three more Afflicted. Against the left (south) wall, a set of steps leads to a ledge with a short, squat pedestal with a potion on it. A set of steps leads up from the bottom of the room to the west to Bthardamz Workshop.\nBthardamz Workshop.\nThe Workshop is a fairly small section of the ruins. If the Dragonborn stops to listen, two Afflicted will be heard discussing Orchendor's request for \"more ichor\" to be sent to him in the Arcenex. This area seems to serve as resting quarters. On the right (north) side, an unlocked gate leads to one bedroom. To the left (south) is another bedroom with the &lt;a href=\"Afflicted%27s%20Note\"&gt;Afflicted's Note&lt;/a&gt; on a table. Directly across to the north is another larger sleeping area.\nThe hallway turns left (south) to an open door that leads to another room, this one with three Dwarven Spiders who will drop down from the nearby pipes when approached. There's a chest and another hidden Spider behind the pipes against the north wall. The nearby east stairway leads up to a balcony in the Upper District with a chest and a good vantage point from which to fire on enemies in the district's as yet unexplored section. Returning to the workshop, the path to the south turns east, where two more Afflicted can be found. A chest is on the left (east) side. The path turns left ((east), then a door on the left (north) side leads to the second Upper District section.\nBthardamz Upper District revisited.\nNext is the area viewed from the balcony. The path takes an immediate U-turn to the right, then leads to a pair of stairs. The short stairs to the right (southeast) lead to the Dwelling (see below). To the left (north), a narrow path leads to a chest as the walls narrow to a dead end. Going straight up the first two stairways to the east and then to the left around the corner, there's a second chest tucked next to a balcony-type platform against the north wall. Staying at this height in the chamber, to the right (west) of the final set of stairs, a &lt;a href=\"Gold%20Ore%20Vein\"&gt;gold ore vein&lt;/a&gt; can be found against the south wall. Further on against that same south wall, after jumping across to the roof tops, is another chest. Back at the final stairs, the path leads to another set of ramps which lead to the door to the Lower District.\nBthardamz Dwelling.\nThe dwelling can be reached through the second section of the Upper District. Upon entering, the Dragonborn might be able to overhear a curious speech of one of the Afflicted. The Dwelling consists of a single room with two Afflicted, a chest, and an apprentice locked gate with the Speech skill book \"&lt;a href=\"Biography%20of%20the%20Wolf%20Queen\"&gt;Biography of the Wolf Queen&lt;/a&gt;\" and another chest. Leaving the dwelling and following the stairway up will lead to the Lower District entrance.\nBthardamz Lower District.\nThe Lower District commons are heavily patrolled by Afflicted as well as a few Dwemer automatons. Again, the Lower District is divided into two distinct areas by the Bthardamz Study.\nThe path starts out west, turns right (north), and leads to a room where a gate on the left side leads to a chest. The path continues to the north (where a few Spiders suddenly appear), then east, to a door. Behind that door, the Lower District opens up into an amphitheater with an Afflicted mage performing for his compatriots. Flipping the lever directly in front of the Dragonborn releases a set of helicopter blade traps that kills the mage, leaving his audience the only ones left to deal with. There is a very visible chest in the center of the room which can be reached easily as long as the blades are turned back off.\nThe path leads east, then north, to another large room with three sets of stairs. The left and right stairs lead to nothing but an empty ledge. The middle (northwest) steps lead to an open gate.\nThe next point of interest is a large cavern with a river. Numerous Afflicted will be patrolling the bridges which crisscross over the river. Again, this is a great spot for a sneaky archer. There's a small chest and a skeleton which can be found by jumping up the rocks to the left of the waterfall. It is possible to climb up the rocks to reach the walkway around the waterfall, but there are a couple of suddenly appearing Dwarven Spheres on the walkway. The yellow glowing bulbs growing on the plants will explode when struck by arrow, but have no other effect. A set of stairs leads down to the east, then turns south to get to a gold-colored path. To the right (south) on the path is a trap, but to the left of the trap is a small room with a chest. Continuing that way leads back to the river, along with a chest and lootable skeleton. Going the other way leads to a gold ore vein on the left (against the north wall), then stairs leading up to the right (south). Across a small walkway is a hallway that leads south, then east to the study.\nBthardamz Study and Lower District upper levels.\nThe study is a very hallway-like area with a few enemies, chests and little else. With a sneaky character, it is actually possible to sneak through the Study without alerting a single enemy. At one point, there is a set of shallow steps leading up to the left ((east) that contain a spinning blade trap whose trigger is right at the bottom. Exiting the other side will lead to the upper tiers of the Lower District.\nTraversing the catwalks starting to the right (north), the Dragonborn will encounter more Afflicted. Behind a gate at the dead end to the right (east, then south) is a chest with leveled loot. Up to the right (north), a ramp curls up to an area where three more mages are sitting. Continuing along the catwalk and hallways leads to the entrance to the Arcanex.\nBthardamz Arcanex.\nThe Arcanex serves as the inner chambers and stronghold for the Afflicted Priest of Peryite, Orchendor. He is guarded by a formidable force of Dwemer Automatons, ranging from spiders to the ever-imposing &lt;a href=\"Dwarven%20Centurion%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Dwarven Centurion&lt;/a&gt;.\nUpon entering, a cavern-like room is seen with a few Dwarven Spiders and Spheres patrolling the bottom. After winding along walkways along the bottom, a long spiral ramp leads up to the higher levels. Before going up the set of stairways, a quick left (east) leads to a nearby chest.\nAt the top of the second set of stairs, where the Centurion patrols, a &lt;a href=\"Quicksilver%20Ore%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;quicksilver ore vein&lt;/a&gt; can be found to the left (east). The hallway leads south, turns left, then left again to another set of stairs up. The path turns left (west) then left again (south) where several Spiders are on guard. The hallway turns right (west), then leads to a room with two sets of steps down to the right (north). Directly ahead is a large column that can be passed on either side. Orchendor is on the other side of the column.\nOrchendor is in a large chamber past the Centurion. He is a highly skilled mage who deals considerable Destruction damage. In addition, Orchendor is completely immune to &lt;a href=\"Fire%20Damage%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;fire&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Frost%20Damage%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;frost&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Shock%20Damage%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;shock&lt;/a&gt; spells, as well as absorption effects; physical weapons are recommended. He is capable of teleporting and will often do so onto the upper tiers of the room, thus raining down fire and frost. Archery is a good choice because it can follow him as he teleports around the room. Once he is defeated, the key to the Bthardamz Elevator can be looted from his corpse to exit. The exit is beyond his room on the left side (against the west wall), then up stairs to the east, over the walkway/bridge to the west, then to the right (north), where the key opens the door to the elevator."}

The goal for the Buckmoth fund is 100 gold. If I have reached the goal, I should return and deliver the gold to Iulus Truptor.\"\nThe member of the Imperial Cult and questgiver &lt;a href=\"Iulus%20Truptor\"&gt;Iulus Truptor&lt;/a&gt; tells the Nerevarine that the &lt;a href=\"Buckmoth%20Legion%20Fort\"&gt;Buckmoth Legion Fort&lt;/a&gt; has experienced an shortfall of alms for the poor. The money is urgently needed to provide the usual services for orphans and indigents. Iulus Truptor asks the Nerevarine to try and raise the needed funds of at least 100 in &lt;a href=\"Ald%27ruhn%20%28Morrowind%29\"&gt;Ald'ruhn&lt;/a&gt;, the city closest to Buckmoth Legion Fort benefiting of the cult's services. He expects the task to be rather difficult, due to the city being the district seat of House Redoran and housing mainly Dunmers, therefore member of the &lt;a href=\"Tribunal%20Temple\"&gt;Tribunal Temple&lt;/a&gt;.\nWalkthrough.\nAfter receiving his mission, the Nerevarine ought to travel to Ald'ruhn. Persuading the people in Ald'ruhn to donate can prove tricky. &lt;a href=\"Speechcraft%20%28Morrowind%29\"&gt;Speechcraft&lt;/a&gt; is an essential &lt;a href=\"Skills%20%28Morrowind%29\"&gt;skill&lt;/a&gt; here. The Nerevarine needs to raise the &lt;a href=\"disposition\"&gt;disposition&lt;/a&gt; for most potential donating citizens considerably.\nIf the Nerevarine succeeds in raising 100 (or even 200 ), he must return to &lt;a href=\"Ebonheart%20%28Morrowind%29\"&gt;Ebonheart&lt;/a&gt; and deliver the money to Iulus Treptor. Alternatively, he can donate a part or all of the gold himself, telling Iulus Treptor that he was able to raise the money in Ald'ruhn.\nReward.\nIf the Nerevarine fails to raise the money (or at least tells Iulus Treptor so), he must wait one day until he can continue with the next almoner's mission."}

After leaving the building in which you assign your &lt;a href=\"Skills%20%28Morrowind%29\"&gt;skills&lt;/a&gt; you will be in a closed off space with a door and a barrel. Inside the barrel is a ring. Behind the door is a room where you talk to an official who tells you laws and information. Before entering that door you must walk along the brick wall until you stop by the building with the barrel next to it. Once you are stopped, begin jumping. It should take 3\u20137 jumps before you phase through the wall.\nBy doing this you have completely cut out the process of being a citizen of Morrowind. If you try to buy or sell anything at any shop or when you try to talk to certain people you will be denied. The shop will say you cannot buy without citizenship.\nAfter performing this glitch you cannot phase back through the wall. And will not be able to enter through the back door as it will be locked.\nPermanently increase attributes.\nThere is a glitch in Morrowind that allows you to create a spell that you can use to permanently increase your skills or &lt;a href=\"Attributes%20%28Morrowind%29\"&gt;attributes&lt;/a&gt;. Go to &lt;a href=\"Arrille%27s%20Tradehouse\"&gt;Arrille's Tradehouse&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Seyda%20Neen%20%28Morrowind%29\"&gt;Seyda Neen&lt;/a&gt;. Buy \"&lt;a href=\"Jack%20of%20Trades%20%28Morrowind%29\"&gt;Jack of Trades&lt;/a&gt;\" spell from &lt;a href=\"Arrille\"&gt;Arrille&lt;/a&gt;. Go to the &lt;a href=\"Balmora%20Mages%20Guild\"&gt;Mages Guild&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Balmora%20%28Morrowind%29\"&gt;Balmora&lt;/a&gt; and talk to &lt;a href=\"Masalinie%20Merian\"&gt;Masalinie Merian&lt;/a&gt; in the basement. Buy \"&lt;a href=\"Soul%20Trap%20%28Morrowind%29\"&gt;Soultrap&lt;/a&gt;\" from her. Talk to &lt;a href=\"Estirdalin\"&gt;Estirdalin&lt;/a&gt; nearby and choose spell making and go down to &lt;a href=\"Fortify%20Attribute%20%28Morrowind%29\"&gt;Fortify Attribute&lt;/a&gt; (or &lt;a href=\"Fortify%20Skill%20%28Morrowind%29\"&gt;fortify skill&lt;/a&gt;). Choose one off the list (ex. Strength) and put the Magnitude to 100\u2013100 and set it on \"self.\" Then, choose \"soultrap\" and set it on \"Target\" do not change the duration or area of the spell. Once you cast it successfully, it increases the chosen skill or attribute by 100. You can also use a &lt;a href=\"Bound%20Items%20%28Morrowind%29\"&gt;bound&lt;/a&gt; weapon of any style and switch it back and forth *using the triggers and holding x* and your skill for that weapon will increase permanently no matter how many times you do it.\nIncreasing attributes to very high levels will eventually result in a very negative value. This is probably due to integer overflow.\nMoney at start.\nAt the very beginning, as you choose your Traits, there should be a shelf to your right with a &lt;a href=\"Limeware%20Platter\"&gt;Limeware Platter&lt;/a&gt; to the right, if you pick it up quickly, open inventory before the &lt;a href=\"Guards%20%28Morrowind%29\"&gt;guard&lt;/a&gt; tells you to hand over \"Any stolen goods\" drop it, and then close your inventory, then when he asks you to give any stolen goods to him, do it, then when you exit the window, it should be there to pick it up with no problem. Should at least be 650 Coins. You can do this with any item you get caught with in the beginning buildings, but it will not wield very much profit. One other notable item to do this with is the hidden key in the second building after the courtyard."}
{"id": "27627", "revid": "32045548", "url": "https://elderscrolls.fandom.com/wiki?curid=27627", "title": "Bugs (Oblivion)", "text": "Using the console.\nFor PC users, some of the bugs on this page can be circumvented using the console, specifically the bugs where Item X is needed but doesn't show up. To open the console, simply press the tilde key (~), which is the key to the left of the '1' key and below the 'Esc' key. Some have stated that the at (@) key (the '2' key) can also open the console.\nBugs.\nCannot use container interface correctly.\n Because the loot/sell interface does not work correctly, players cannot interact with containers or shopkeepers correctly. Upon clicking anywhere, the interface exits. This bug has been found in after patch v.1.2.0416\nShopkeepers: Cannot sell or haggle items.\nContainers: Cannot loot items using 'activate' button and cannot use 'take all' button. Also, cannot put items in containers. A partial solution for looting is to use the standard arrow-keys and 'Enter'/'Return' button to individually select and take loot.\nFull Solution: Change the left-mouse button in the 'Controls' section to anything but 'Activate' and the regular mouse functions will work. (assuming any other function works. If not, use\u00a0'Attack')\nGame freezes.\n Upon loading a save game, Oblivion runs fine. Freezing occurs three to four\u00a0minutes into playing (ex; talking to townspeople, etc.). Another instance is a frozen black screen after entering or exiting buildings and fast traveling. During the freeze,\u00a0on Xbox 360; the dashboard doesn't show up and\u00a0the player\u00a0cannot interact with the console at all, the only solution being to turn it off. Unconfirmed on PC and PS3 versions.\nSolution: Holding down the Y button on the loading screen will clear the loading cache, making the game playable again, but may delete the save.\nPC Crash: There is a bug that crashes the game by toggling a NPC's collision then using \"tcl\" while they are selected in\u00a0the console talk to them, open the console while the talk menu is loaded then kill them with the command \"kill.\" Oblivion will crash.\nDisk read errors.\n These seem to occur on the Xbox 360 and PS3 version from time to time even with a clean, unscratched copy of the game. This bug may very well have to do with the console itself rather than the disk, but is notable, as it occurs on many consoles.\nSolution: Save fairly often (this should be done anyway in case\u00a0of death). It helps to make sure that the game itself is set to auto-save frequently. If a disk read error happens, restart the game, and it should play fine. If it continues, the problem seems to go away if\u00a0the player\u00a0removes, cleans, and re-inserts the disk. On Xbox 360, going into\u00a0the memory, having\u00a0the selection over \"Hard Drive,\" push Y for options, and then clear system cache. This will make the game readable. However, some of the\u00a0downloadable content might not work, in which case\u00a0the player will\u00a0have to re-download them, and some save games might not work.\nOther solution:\u00a0The player\u00a0can also try cleaning\u00a0their lens, even with Oblivion's many Disk Read Errors it is most often caused by a dusty lens (as are a few other Xbox titles excessively prone).\u00a0They can try doing a \"thorough\" cleaning with a can of air (YouTube has a few methods geared for the 360). At the least this should lessen the frequency. Even just \"blowing\" inside the disk tray can help.\nSeemingly endless \"enemy nearby\" or \"guards pursuing you\" messages.\nIf when the player tries to wait, they get either of the aforementioned messages, commit a crime and pay the fine (a petty crime, obviously) and they should be able to wait and fast travel again, or they could just use save/load.\nUse the &lt;a href=\"Console%20Commands%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;console&lt;/a&gt;~, and type \"swdp.\" This should list a group of people currently detecting them. Whoever isn't physically present (i.e. Imperial Watch), is who the player will want to find, and talk to. Often they will run up to the player, as if to confront them, but the result will be the same as if the player started a conversation. For this reason, if they commit a crime in, say; the Imperial City, its often a good idea to get rid of the bounty while still there, and talk to a guard afterwards. To test if they still have the issue, try to wait. Usually this fix works.\nSee this thread for more details, including how to extract from the proprietary Installshield .cab files: &lt;a href=\"http%3A//www.elderscrolls.com/forums/index.php%3Fshowtopic%3D368389%26amp%3Bview%3Dfindpost%26amp%3Bp%3D5669613\"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;. However, this may not work due to the issue with the console involving Windows Vista or Windows 7.\nMages Guild - Cheydinhal Recommendation.\nThis has been found on several forums for both PC and Xbox 360 versions.\nIf this quest is not completed within three game days of starting the quest, the item the player is looking for will disappear (probably as part of the normal three-day cell reset routine) from the place where they are supposed to search, and therefore makes the Mages Guild quest impossible to complete.\nAnother bug which has been confirmed happens when the player takes the &lt;a href=\"Ring%20of%20Burden\"&gt;Ring of Burden&lt;/a&gt; off Vidkun's body and drop it before the journal update appears. This results in the quest not being able to be finished. The only way to fix this is to reload from a previous save game.\nSolution: The player can use the cheat player.additem 0002E5AC 1 to fix this (it gives them the ring - then just walk into the building and talk to &lt;a href=\"Deetsan\"&gt;Deetsan&lt;/a&gt;).\nMages Guild - Arcane University - A Mage's Staff.\nBy falling off the island (near the staff) instead of fighting the necromancers,\u00a0the player\u00a0will be forced to return to Wellspring Cave again to regain access to the island. When\u00a0they return, the necromancers will be gone and\u00a0they will be unable to finish the quest. More information can be found on . If the Hero\u00a0has a high Acrobatics skill and a lot of patience,they can jump their way up the side of the island and continue the quest as normal.\nSolution: Either re-load a previous save or use \"setstage 000e4e14 30\" in the console.\nThieves Guild - &lt;a href=\"May%20the%20Best%20Thief%20Win\"&gt;May the Best Thief Win&lt;/a&gt;.\nOn the PC version there is a bug in this quest. Methredhel gets to the diary almost immediately, and although the map indicates that the book is in her chest in her house, it does not appear in the chest when it is opened. It is not possible to &lt;a href=\"pickpocket\"&gt;pickpocket&lt;/a&gt; Methredhel for it since she is not carrying it. Even after\u00a0thirty days Methredhel never takes the diary to Armand, and the secondary method of entering the Guild is never triggered. It is therefore impossible to join the &lt;a href=\"Thieves%20Guild%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;Thieves Guild&lt;/a&gt; should this bug happen. An interesting version of this bug is when Methredhel doesn't get the diary immediately. This could happen if she gets interrupted by another NPC, or when she gets stuck on a \"glitch spot\" - a spot where an NPC will be stuck and unable to move. Another solution is to have a high Athletics skill, and as long as\u00a0the player\u00a0knows where they are going,\u00a0they can beat Methredhel there. It doesn't actually matter if she beats them there or not. Methredhel is always in &lt;a href=\"Sneak%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;sneak&lt;/a&gt; mode in the house, so all\u00a0they have to do is run to the desk that the diary is in and take it (no sneaking is\u00a0needed).\nSolutions:\nUse the cheat \"player.additem 000355ED 1\" or use \"movetoqt 1\" to get the diary and give it to Armand to complete the quest and join the guild.\nAnother way to complete this is for the player\u00a0to talk to the beggar and get the location, then fast-travel there. Run full-tilt for the door, though she will likely beat\u00a0them there. Go in after her (having &lt;a href=\"The%20Tower%20Stone%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;the Tower Stone&lt;/a&gt; active helps open the door, though it is not necessary as long as they\u00a0have enough &lt;a href=\"Lockpick%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;lockpicks&lt;/a&gt; or the &lt;a href=\"Skeleton%20Key%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;Skeleton Key&lt;/a&gt;) and she will still be in sneak mode, in an empty floor of the house. Just leave sneak mode and dash past her to the desk, where the diary is. She never breaks sneak, the house owner is never downstairs to see\u00a0the player\u00a0un-sneaking, and Methredhel doesn't care if\u00a0they are visible to her when\u00a0they get it. The invisibility is not required.\nOne of the easier ways to do this, is to pickpocket Methredhel or her \"partner\" before getting the quest. Steal the house key, start the quest, let her take the book, then just go back to her place and\u00a0take it.\u00a0Or, simply pick the lock on the door with lockpicks, magic, or the Tower Stone birthsign.\nAnother solution is to attack her. She is marked as an essential character and therefore cannot die. When she overtakes the player, attack her and take the diary.\nA simpler solution is to lay an immobilization spell on her and get a good\u00a0ten second head start.\nThe last solution to solve this is the paintbrush glitch. All\u00a0the player\u00a0has to do is gather\u00a0thirty or so paintbrushes and drop them in a circle around her.\u00a0Make sure to do this before speaking to Armand.\u00a0Generally, the player will\u00a0find that the brushes hover over the ground by\u00a0three feet or so, they will also\u00a0notice she won't be able to run through or jump, thus allowing\u00a0them to take their\u00a0time to go steal the book.\nGlitches.\nDuplicating items with a bow.\nTo clone items with a bow, ready an arrow with the bow, and while holding down the button, open\u00a0the inventory and let go of the fire button. When in\u00a0the inventory, drop the desired\u00a0item to duplicate and exit\u00a0the inventory. Once\u00a0the player\u00a0exits,\u00a0their arrow will fire directly at the item and clone the item to how many arrows are in their quiver, this glitch will work with all types of items except for the glowing root, there is no crash caused by the glitch unless\u00a0they create a very copious amount, though it can be done multiple times.\nAn extremely rare glitch may occur when duplicating to many items at once inside of a house, this will result in the game freezing. What sets this apart from other glitches is that if\u00a0the player\u00a0removes the disc while the console is frozen and place it inside again, they\u00a0may get lucky and the game will start again quite some time later. If\u00a0they can succeed in reproducing the glitch,\u00a0they will find that there is a small bag not jammed through the floor and every item that is in that house is not inside of that bag as well as anything that an npc may have been carrying at the time that the glitch occurred and taking from the bag is not considered stealing.\nCopying daggers and staves.\nThis glitch requires\u00a0the player\u00a0having the &lt;a href=\"Staff%20of%20Worms\"&gt;Staff of Worms&lt;/a&gt; acquired from &lt;a href=\"Mannimarco%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;Mannimarco&lt;/a&gt;, and the &lt;a href=\"Skull%20of%20Corruption%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;Skull of Corruption&lt;/a&gt; from the &lt;a href=\"Daedric%20Prince\"&gt;Daedric Prince&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Vaermina\"&gt;Vaermina&lt;/a&gt;.\nTo start this glitch off\u00a0the player will\u00a0need to kill someone or find someone that is already dead. Once\u00a0they have found a dead body, put the desired\u00a0weapon to copy on the dead person's body. After that use the Staff of Worms to reanimate the dead person. Once they are up off the ground shoot the Skull of Corruption at the person\u00a0they reanimated. When the clone appears of that person,\u00a0the player\u00a0will notice that they have the weapon that\u00a0they wanted to copy. Once the clone gets the weapon out as if they are going to attack something, kill them before the originally reanimated person \"dies.\" The desired\u00a0weapon to clone should be on the floor somewhere after\u00a0the player\u00a0kill the clone. Collect the cloned weapon off the floor and then go to the dead body\u00a0they cloned, then\u00a0search their body and take the weapon\u00a0they cloned. After all of this is done\u00a0the player\u00a0should have a duplicate of the weapon\u00a0they wanted to duplicate.\nTo duplicate the Staff of Worms, find a dead body, then remove any weapon it may have. Stand close so\u00a0the player\u00a0can still search the corpse. Begin to shoot the body with the Staff, but quickly (before the animation completes and the bolt fires) open the corpse and place the staff in it. The bolt will still fire, resurrecting it; proceed to clone and kill or disarm the clone.\nBe sure that the corpse does not have any other weapons on its body. It is not possible to clone the Skull of Corruption using this method.\nCrash on exit leading to crash on running/loading.\nSome players find that \"Oblivion\" crashes sometimes on exit. They also find that \"Oblivion\" will crash on startup after one of these crashes. While the cause of the crash on exit is unknown, a cause of the crash on startup has been found.\nSolution:\nApparently corrupts the Oblivion - meshes.bsa file when it crashes on exit, and this causes it to crash on startup. To fix the problem, replace the current meshes.bsa with an original copy from the DVD by copying it out of the Installshield .cab files on the DVD, or by reinstalling the game.\nStretching people.\nWhen people or\u00a0creatures are killed, sometimes their body turns to 'jelly' and they ball up on the floor. When this happens, it continually happens to that person or\u00a0creature until the game is reset. This can be quite fun as now\u00a0the player\u00a0can stretch the body as long as\u00a0they want and it just keeps stretching. This might also happen when\u00a0the player\u00a0shoots them with a paralyze spell.\nThis can also be done to the player if using a custom paralyze self spell.\nEasy inside buildings.\n\"Note: in order to do this glitch\u00a0the player must be able to become the \"Jelly\" that is stated in the above glitch\"\nMake sure that\u00a0the player\u00a0presses A the second\u00a0they go into third person. Most of the time if\u00a0they are\u00a0too slow,\u00a0they will just collapse to the \"Jelly\" form and will have to try again.\nSometimes\u00a0the player\u00a0will just be shot to another door in the town and still be inside the map. This might be caused by running point blank at the door when performing the glitch.\nIf\u00a0the player\u00a0does this and does NOT turn to jelly,\u00a0they will be teleported to some unknown destination either in the town or somewhere in the map.\nShifting staves.\nWhen a staff is placed somewhere by a player it will shift a foot or two towards the direction the head of the staff is facing. This happens when a player reloads into the area after saving in another area. (Has been fixed in patched versions)\nPaintbrushes.\nA miscellaneous item that can be found in many areas in \"Oblivion\". While seeming ordinary, Paintbrushes are not under the effects of the physics engine in \"Oblivion\"; that is,\u00a0the player\u00a0can drop one from their inventory and it will float in the air in front of them. This is very useful for creating a \"bridge\" of paintbrushes to reach areas more easily. Unless\u00a0the player\u00a0hates cheating, it's a good idea to carry several paintbrushes, and pick up any\u00a0they might find.\nPaintbrushes can usually be found in many chests, barrels, and sacks in cities, which prove to be the easiest places to find them.\nThis also seems to work with bricks and bones.\nNote: On the PS3 and 360 version if\u00a0the player\u00a0has the Shivering Isles Expansion the Paintbrushes will be added under the effects of the physics engine. This does not apply for the Game of The Year version.\nJumping the Bruma wall.\nOn the southeast wall of Bruma there are several houses that allow\u00a0the player\u00a0to jump onto the wall with a\u00a0high enough Acrobatics\u00a0skill. While there are multiple areas that allow\u00a0them to jump onto the wall, there is no invisible wall guarding the southeast wall, allowing\u00a0them to jump over.\nWith high enough Agility, Athletics, and Acrobatics,\u00a0the player\u00a0can jump from the ledge around the chapel onto J'Ghasta's House, and then jumping to Helvius Cecia's House. After doing so, stand on top of the roof as high as possible and jump onto the ledge on the wall. Simply jump over the wall in order to enter an unbound map with no detail. If\u00a0the player\u00a0cannot reach the top of the roof, try quickly running downwards for a step or two and then switching directions and running back up (as long as\u00a0they continue running\u00a0they can walk up a roof without problem).\nThe player\u00a0may un-glitch themselves by entering the main gate of Bruma (which will be to the Jerall Mountains) or by using map-travel.\nThis is actually a brilliant way to find map locations without having to worry about enemies.\u00a0The player\u00a0can go all over Cyrodiil with everything unloaded and\u00a0they can find any map location. The only danger is that\u00a0the player\u00a0cannot see the ground\u00a0they are walking on, only the grass (every so often), so\u00a0they have no idea if\u00a0they are going to drop off a mountain. Remember to save often.\nIf\u00a0the player\u00a0travels to the edge of the map\u00a0they will fall for a short period of time and then instantaneously die. (One player, however, did this with a\u00a0high-level character and went far past the edge of the map, yet did not die. It seems to just be a \"mountain\" drop.)\nNote: This is possible to do on every major city in Cyrodiil. There is even a way to exit the Arena in this manner.\nBodyless horseman.\nWhen riding a horse switch to the third person view and look at\u00a0the player's\u00a0shadow to see a man riding a horse, then switch back to first person and watch as a horse's shadow is riding alone.\nLonger chain in the Arena.\nWhen\u00a0the player\u00a0goes into a fight at the arena, use the flare spell, (or something similar) at the chain holding the lamp (that\u00a0they will\u00a0see when\u00a0they walk in). The chain should grow longer but leave gaps between the rings. This also works with almost any ranged destruction spell, it doesn't have to be fire.\nThe walk-throughable wall.\nInside the Cheydinhal Bridge Inn, there is a wall the player can walk through. It is located where the three barrels stand on the first floor. There is also a chest floating about ten meters underneath it, with enough time, the player can click on the chest but it needs a key. It is quite possible that the key was never put into the game and that this chest was moved out of sight to save time. If the player misses the chest, they will appear back up on the first floor. Note: these chests are under many stores, and often hold most of the store owner's inventory. They must be unlocked with the \"unlock\" cheat, and are an easy source of items. The only way to get to them is to go into fly mode and look under the store (while inside it).\nFor example, there is a chest under Red Diamond Jewelry in the Imperial City. Underneath it is a chest with a powerful magic ring. It can be found via toggling clipping. (tcl)\nThere is another wall that the player can walk through. Find &lt;a href=\"Dorian%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;Dorian&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;a href=\"Talos%20Plaza%20District\"&gt;Talos Plaza District&lt;/a&gt;. Go to his basement door, face the wall that is across from it and walk towards it. The player should immediately go through. If they can time it right and go fast enough, they can be teleported upstairs to his bedroom door. It has been done successfully about five times.\nBloodworks wall glitch.\nOnce inside the Bloodworks, go down the stairs. Where the player can see the Blue Team Arena Gladiator infinitely shooting arrows, turn facing the way you came in. They should be looking upstairs. If they can manage to jump on top of the stone Archway at the end of the stairway, they can walk on top of the Bloodworks. To get back to the mapped part of the Bloodworks, just fall off the edge into the black abyss and they will be teleported back.\nBloodworks corner glitch.\n Once inside the Bloodworks, go down the stairs but not actually into the Bloodworks. The player will notice an archway door on the stairs side; if they sneak and walk into the left corner, they can climb the wall and be sitting in midair. This glitch is really just an easter egg. It is possible to use this glitch on most of the corners in the game but this corner works exceptionally well.\nSwimming in the mid-air.\nGo somewhere where there is a guard and a body of water nearby. Attack the guard and run to the water. When the guard talks to the player while in the water, choose to pay the fine. The player can now swim in the mid-air until they touch the ground or open a door.\nExploits.\nInfinite enchantment - Ring of Desiccation.\nDuring the quest \"&lt;a href=\"The%20Coming%20Storm\"&gt;The Coming Storm&lt;/a&gt;\" in &lt;a href=\"Crucible\"&gt;Crucible&lt;/a&gt;, the player is told to find the &lt;a href=\"Ring%20of%20Desiccation\"&gt;Ring of Desiccation&lt;/a&gt; (they can find it in the \"Museum Of Oddities.\" Opt to take the tour and steal the ring when &lt;a href=\"Una%20Armina\"&gt;Una Armina&lt;/a&gt; is not looking.) They can receive both enchantments from the Ring Of Desiccation (Water walking and Water Breathing) permanently on the character. If they get arrested (in Cyrodiil, but not the Shivering Isles), and they opt to go to jail, they can serve their term; when they get out, they will find that they cannot equip the Ring of Desiccation (\"You cannot equip this enchanted item right now\" displays). However, if the player checks their Active Enchantments, they will find out that they have both effects active. The glitch stays active even after the player turns in the ring during the quest. This bug works in similar ways on other rings as well e.g. &lt;a href=\"Ring%20of%20the%20Vipereye\"&gt;Ring of the Vipereye&lt;/a&gt; (though it is done vice-versa with this particular ring since the player obtains it in Cyrodiil, meaning they must receive the sentence at the Shivering Isles); also they won`t be able to remove the ring from their inventory as it becomes a \"quest item\" permanently. The ring must be a quest item that they cannot normally drop out of their inventory once acquired, and it must be stolen. Another such way to permanently enchant the item onto themself is to have it - or a similar object on when they do the Sanguine Shrine Quest. The spell he gives them to cast will affect the player as well, removing all of their items.\nInfinite money \u2013 Dorian glitch.\nThis bug reportedly works for both the PC and Xbox 360 version. In order to achieve infinite money, murder Dorian located in Talos Plaza District. Loot him, and take his money. Instead of being removed from his inventory, the money remains and can be taken as many times as the player wants. When the guards come, simply pay the fine. The player should still have the money, minus the fine, in their inventory. They can also simply use a paralyze spell on him and pickpocket the money without having to kill him.\nIf the player cannot kill Dorian before he runs out the door, then either come back when they can, use the difficulty slider, or use a spell to paralyze him. They could also use the &lt;a href=\"Yield\"&gt;Yield&lt;/a&gt; exploit to drain a lot of health before he actually starts to run away.\n\"Note:\" This bug is somewhat inconsistent. Oftentimes Dorian will only have 10 gold on him (or another very low amount) This happens because the player has just recently begun the game. If they have played the game for at least 30 days or so then he will have somewhere near 200 gold or higher. The NPCs seem to gain money the more days the player has played the game. In this scenario they will not be able to grab infinite money. Use sneak to pickpocket him and it should show how much money he has (they don't want to actually take his gold at this point). If he does not have a reasonable amount, specifically at least 35 gold, use the &lt;a href=\"Speechcraft%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;Speechcraft&lt;/a&gt; (&lt;a href=\"disposition\"&gt;disposition&lt;/a&gt;) system and bribe him. This will put money in his pocket and make the glitch viable. If they keep using the Yield exploit, they will be draining his disposition, making it possible to \"keep\" bribing him over and over - it is possible to shove over 2000g into him before he ran out of health - that's 2000g every single time the player tries to grab the money.\nHis body should stay there for several game days (allowing the player to continue stealing infinite money from his corpse), but it will disappear once the cell resets.\nBe warned: If the player hits the \"Take All\" command when looting his body after the glitch has been activated, their system will freeze.\nExample video: &lt;a href=\"http%3A//www.youtube.com/watch%3Fv%3DKqDxtoaKE-M%26amp%3BNR%3D1\"&gt;see here&lt;/a&gt;\nNotes:\nInfinite money \u2013 Vampire Cure reward glitch.\nAfter completing the &lt;a href=\"Vampire%20Cure%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;Vampire Cure quest&lt;/a&gt; and getting the potion to the count's wife, come back the next day and ask him for a reward. He will give the player level dependent gold (A level 20 should get about 3000). They can keep asking and clicking 'reward' and he will give them the reward each time. If the player is over level 30, the cash reward will be 10,000 Septims.\nThis glitch assumes that the player can give the woman &lt;a href=\"bloodgrass\"&gt;bloodgrass&lt;/a&gt;. It is only for PS3 Game of the Year North American versions. It is activated by completing the Main Quest before they give her bloodgrass. It is easily bypassed by completing the quest before finishing the Main Quest. She might not recognize that the player's inventory has bloodgrass, therefore making them unable to complete the Vampire Cure quest (If they have the PS3 version, they can bypass this glitch by changing the PS3's system language to German, as this will change the in-game language). Think twice about becoming a &lt;a href=\"Vampirism%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;vampire&lt;/a&gt; unless the player has the &lt;a href=\"The%20Vile%20Lair\"&gt;The Vile Lair&lt;/a&gt; official plug-in.\nInfinite money \u2013 &lt;a href=\"Cheydinhal%20Mages%20Guild\"&gt;Cheydinhal Mages Guild&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Containers%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;counter&lt;/a&gt; that &lt;a href=\"Eilonwy\"&gt;Eilonwy&lt;/a&gt; stands behind to sell her goods is capable of respawning two &lt;a href=\"Apparatus%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;Novice Apparatus&lt;/a&gt; (every twenty-four hours or so) after the originals have been removed from inside it and resold to her (and only her). It is a constant source of 75\u2013100 depending on the player's current level of &lt;a href=\"Mercantile%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;Haggling&lt;/a&gt; selected for her, and as long as the player continues to sell them to her they will continue to respawn in the counter.\nGlitch.\nInfinite gold \u2013 female Orc in Kvatch.\nThere is an exploit if the player can find a person that will buy items that is outside a city while on a horse. The best &lt;a href=\"Characters%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;NPC&lt;/a&gt; is an Orc woman who buys and sells weapons in the camp just outside the main gate to &lt;a href=\"Kvatch%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;Kvatch&lt;/a&gt;. Obtain a very high-valued weapon and equip it, go to the camp and while on a horse with the weapon equipped, sell this item to her and the player will receive the gold for the weapon, however as the player is on a horse, the game will not allow them to unequip weapons. The result is that they sell the item however it will not leave their inventory, so they can sell it again and again until they have the desired amount of gold. The upside to this exploit is that it is faster than above and they can raise their mercantile skills as they are trading to receive the gold.\nNotes:\nPermanent bound items.\nFor this, the player may need a Disintegrate armor or weapon spell or just somewhere to wear down their bound armor or weapon and some repair hammers depending on how good at armorer the player is. First of all, summon the bound armor or weapon, then use the Disintegrate Armor or Weapon spell or damage it in some way so that when they return to the inventory its rating is not 100. Then use repair hammers to repair it \"without\" unequipping it, it should let the player drop them. Now the bound armor or weapon should be on the floor in front of the player. All they have to do now is wait. Once the spell has worn off, they will see the familiar yellow mist around them as the weapon or armor supposedly evaporates but it will not disappear off the floor. Pick it up again and they will now have a weightless bound item.\nCloning items.\nAt one point, duplication was simple. There were once four or five ways to do so, but all of them involving arrows have been patched. Even still, new ways have been found to glitch the game, but if people did not get the 2009 edition, it would be patched. (Confirmed)\nScroll cloning\nThe player will need two or more of any one kind of scroll, e.g. Flare, or Dispel. Activate that particular scroll and drop any other single item. The key is that the player must be dropping more items than they have: Two scrolls will drop two items. If they have three of the item they are trying to drop with two scrolls, nothing will be duplicated, the player will just drop two items. Also, they cannot duplicate damaged equipment. The equipment being duplicated must be in perfect quality. It must be only at 100 condition.\nShould the player wish to duplicate items at a larger rate, they must ensure you have at least two scrolls, of the same type, as well as at least one scroll of a different type. (They must have less of these than the first one) Then begin to duplicate scrolls, until they have as many scrolls as they need, e.g. one-hundred scrolls. Then they may duplicate as normal, 100 items coming out each time they duplicate.\nIf the player is trying to clone arrows, they can utilize a shortcut. Start with the arrows unequipped, select the scrolls, then instead of dropping them equip them and it should give the player as many arrows as they have scrolls.\nBe careful when duplicating large numbers of items, as it can lag excessively. It is a good idea to pick up previously cloned objects before making more. Using stacks rather than singular items reduces the lag (if the player is duplicating an item with one-hundred scrolls, one-hundred objects will be rendered and calculated on the screen, if they use a stack of five, it only needs to render twenty objects).\nNo character-specific items, quest items, or rewards will duplicate: the game includes only a certain number of these in one game. This includes Nirnroot, Buma's armor, the Staff of Worms, and all other quest-related items or character-specific items: anything carried by one specific NPC and one only (Buma, Mainnimarco, anyone with a real name). Though if the player has a 2010 version of Game of the Year or the 5th anniversary edition, they will be able to \"scroll clone\" almost every item as long as it has full charge and condition. Also, most items the player must create will not duplicate: Black Soul Gems, player-enchanted armor, etc. (Enchanted armor found on enemies will duplicate, so long as the item is common.) A few common items may not be duplicated:\nHow to scroll clone:\n\"Note: Enchanted items (an Axe of Soul Trap, a Bow of Magicka, etc.), items with unique names (Sir Amiel's Ring), damaged items, and of course quest items cannot be duplicated in the 5th anniversary edition.\"\nHow to scroll clone huge amounts:\nCloning in the 40\u201360 range shows no signs of game lag. Cloning in the one-hundred range begins to lag the game. Approaching the one-thousand range may cause the screen to flicker, shake, or jitter around (confirmed on Xbox360). If there is enough of the cloned item or if the item has enough polygons, the \"loading area\" notification will appear. After approximately ten seconds, the game reloads at the exact moment from when it crashes. All cloned items are conveniently placed in a loot bag directly underneath the player.\nAlternate cloning methods.\n&lt;a href=\"Dawnfang/Duskfang\"&gt;Dawnfang/Duskfang&lt;/a&gt;\nIf the player mounted on a horse at the time that the swords switch (6:00 A.M./P.M.) and they have it equipped, they still retain the original fang but they also get the other fang (i.e. They are mounted at dusk with Dawnfang, they still have Dawnfang but Duskfang is still added to their inventory - this glitch only allows the player to obtain an indefinite amount of swords).\nHas been confirmed for PS3 and Xbox360, as well as PC GOTY edition.\nIt is important to note that the latest patch for PS3 has eliminated this glitch. It has not been fixed on the latest patch for Xbox360.\nPermanent enchantment glitch.\nThis is an interesting way to raise the player's attributes considerably, if they have the time. They will need:\nTo do this, they must:\nNotes: Duplicate Sigil Stones or Grand Soul Gems and Copper Rings (or other items the player is enchanting) so they do not have to re-purchase the items over and over.\nIt is recommended that the player use Sigil Stones, as they come with useful enchantments such as Feather or Fortify Magicka. If they duplicate a Sigil Stone that uses feather over one hundred times and then duplicate a copper ring one-hundred times, They can use this permanent enchantment glitch to make the player able to carry well over ten-thousand pounds.\nIt is possible in-game to clone the player with the reward they get from the &lt;a href=\"Vaermina%20%28Quest%29\"&gt;Vaermina Daedric Quest&lt;/a&gt; the &lt;a href=\"Skull%20of%20Corruption%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;Skull of Corruption&lt;/a&gt;. There are two methods to do this.\nMethod 1 is easier than Method 2 but the player will need a &lt;a href=\"Mysticism%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;Mysticism&lt;/a&gt; skill of at least 75. This is for a reflect spell 100% on target spell for at least 2 seconds. They also need a &lt;a href=\"Followers%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;follower&lt;/a&gt; to do this trick or an NPC who does not move.\nMethod 2 is harder as it requires an NPC to pick it up and fire it at the player which can be tricky without a Disintegrate Weapon spell. However, there is no need for a high level Mysticism skill.\nCloning items with the Skull of Corruption and Staff of Worms.\nIf the player does not want to clone themselves to clone items, they can also do this:\nPermanent 50% resistance to Poison and Disease.\nThe player must have the quest \"&lt;a href=\"Lifting%20the%20Vale\"&gt;Lifting the Vale&lt;/a&gt;\" active, and have recovered the &lt;a href=\"Draconian%20Madstone\"&gt;Draconian Madstone&lt;/a&gt;, but not returned it to the Countess.\nOthers (unsorted, unverified, etc).\nThieves Guild: the stationary Fox.\n\"Verified on Xbox 360\"\nThis bug is triggered by adding the &lt;a href=\"Boots%20of%20Springheel%20Jak%20%28Item%29\"&gt;Boots of Springheel Jak&lt;/a&gt; to the inventory via the console prior to completion of &lt;a href=\"Taking%20Care%20of%20Lex\"&gt;Taking Care of Lex&lt;/a&gt;. Upon adding the boots to the inventory, the player will get a quest pop-up from the &lt;a href=\"Boots%20of%20Springheel%20Jak%20%28Quest%29\"&gt;Boots of Springheel Jak quest&lt;/a&gt;, saying that they must return the boots to the &lt;a href=\"The%20Gray%20Fox%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;Gray Fox&lt;/a&gt; in Ganredhel's house in &lt;a href=\"Cheydinhal%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;Cheydinhal&lt;/a&gt;. However, if they try to talk to him there, his greeting will be, \"I assume you have the boots\" as if they have completed the quest, yet the standard yes/no dialogue options will not appear. They will instead be presented with the regular dialogue options presented when talking to any other guild member, and they will have to complete &lt;a href=\"Taking%20Care%20of%20Lex\"&gt;Taking Care of Lex&lt;/a&gt; to ride out the bug.\nWhen the player gets the quest \"&lt;a href=\"Turning%20a%20Blind%20Eye\"&gt;Turning a Blind Eye&lt;/a&gt;\" from &lt;a href=\"Methredhel\"&gt;Methredhel&lt;/a&gt;, the Gray Fox will not be in &lt;a href=\"Helvius%20Cecia\"&gt;Helvius Cecia&lt;/a&gt;'s house like he is supposed to be. He will remain in Ganredhel's house, saying, \"I assume you have the boots\" only now they can talk to him about their next assignment. This will keep happening until they complete Boots of Springheel Jak quest. Note this also happens on the two consoles, if they loot his corpse or pickpocket him.\n&lt;a href=\"Where%20Spirits%20Have%20Lease\"&gt;Where Spirits Have Lease&lt;/a&gt;.\nIssue: After finding &lt;a href=\"Velwyn%20Benirus\"&gt;Velwyn Benirus&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Imperial%20City%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;Imperial City&lt;/a&gt;, he says to meet him back at &lt;a href=\"The%20Count%27s%20Arms\"&gt;The Count's Arms&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Anvil%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;Anvil&lt;/a&gt;. However,\u00a0the player\u00a0may find that he is not there.\nSolution: He says to meet in a couple of hours, so wait around two hours and he should show up in the inn. Also, try looking in the staircase of the inn.\nAnother problem that occurs is Velwyn getting himself loaded inside a wall or staircase in the Count's Arms. This is related to the bug description just above, and it also happens in the Imperial City. The only solution\u00a0that has been found\u00a0was to leave the quest\u00a0alone for an in-game week or so. When\u00a0the player\u00a0returns to the inn,\u00a0they should hopefully see a reloaded Velwyn standing out in the open where\u00a0they can talk to him.\nNote: This wall glitch occasionally happens to other quest characters. Glarthir has been found inside the cathedral wall when\u00a0the player\u00a0goes to talk to him about those he thinks are spying on him.\nIssue: After finding Velwyn in the Imperial City his disposition toward the Hero is 100, and that's regardless of Personality score or even if the player never tried to raise his disposition before. He will then refuse to help rendering the quest broken.\nSolution: The reason he is refusing to help is because the player did not take the \"&lt;a href=\"Scrap%20from%20Lorgren%27s%20Diary\"&gt;Scrap from Lorgren's Diary&lt;/a&gt;\" from the basement of &lt;a href=\"Benirus%20Manor\"&gt;Benirus Manor&lt;/a&gt;. Without the diary page, Velwyn will refuse to help every time one asks and the quest will not continue.\nThe Siren's Deception.\nIssue: In &lt;a href=\"Anvil%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;Anvil&lt;/a&gt;, for the quest \"&lt;a href=\"The%20Siren%27s%20Deception\"&gt;The Siren's Deception&lt;/a&gt;,\" it is possible that the player will not\u00a0be able to enter the farmhouse. Signy Home-Wrecker and Faustina Cartia may attack\u00a0them at the &lt;a href=\"Flowing%20Bowl\"&gt;Flowing Bowl&lt;/a&gt;. If\u00a0the player\u00a0kills them,\u00a0they get the basement key, but\u00a0is locked out of the farm to finish the mission. This bug can be fixed by removing all infamy before meeting them at the &lt;a href=\"Flowing%20Bowl\"&gt;Flowing Bowl&lt;/a&gt; the first time. Also, the door may be locked from the inside, meaning that\u00a0the player\u00a0cannot get out.\nThis bug can be reproduced by getting caught by the pair while stealing at the inn.\u00a0The player\u00a0can either finish the quest by murdering the pair or trigger a script update by finishing or progressing in another quest. (unverified)\nSolution: Be sure to meet them at the farmhouse at the appropriate time: after 11 pm.\nIf\u00a0the player\u00a0is locked out, use the cheat code codice_1 without quotes and kill the woman in there and then the mission should finish automatically.\nAlso it is possible that after killing the gang, the quest is not updated. In that case type this into console \"player.setstage MS04 60\" this will then bring the two guards into the farm house.\nBruma - &lt;a href=\"Lifting%20the%20Vale\"&gt;Lifting the Vale&lt;/a&gt;.\nIssue: When\u00a0the player\u00a0goes north to find the Akaviri artifact for the Countess of Bruma, and completes the quest and comes back,\u00a0they may still have \"enemies nearby,\" even in towns and inns, no matter where\u00a0they go.\nSolution: To fix this,\u00a0the player\u00a0must go back to Serpent Trail, to the ruin\u00a0they found the artifact in, and search it extensively. There are many skeletons in there, and\u00a0they have to find the one or many that are giving\u00a0the player\u00a0the message and kill them.\nMages Guild - &lt;a href=\"Chorrol%20Recommendation\"&gt;Chorrol Recommendation&lt;/a&gt;.\nIf\u00a0the player\u00a0opts to go with the \"Guild Way\" and returns the item to the guild, the guildmaster will tell\u00a0them that\u00a0they get his recommendation,\u00a0but the green arrow still points to him although\u00a0they actually have in effect received the recommendation, the quest pointer is incorrect and can be ignored.\nNote: If\u00a0the player\u00a0reads\u00a0their journal,\u00a0it says\u00a0they must talk to Earana and tell her\u00a0they gave the book to the guildmaster. Once\u00a0they have spoken to her again the marker arrow will not show in Chorrol.\n&lt;a href=\"Go%20Fish\"&gt;Go Fish&lt;/a&gt;: Slaughterfish.\nIssue: During the quest that involves\u00a0the player\u00a0killing twelve slaughterfish for their scales, the quest markers may be off at times (in locations with no fish).\nSolution: This is a large pain, but if\u00a0the player\u00a0swims around the lake using &lt;a href=\"Detect%20Life%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;Detect Life&lt;/a&gt;,\u00a0they should eventually find the slaughterfish. It will be perfectly still, making no movement at all; once\u00a0they attack it, the map marker will update and it will start to move and attack as normal.\nIssue #2: During the quest, the player\u00a0may not find any fish, even at the green marker.\nSolution: This comes from a clipping problem where the fish spawned directly in a rock under the water. The player\u00a0can use the console command to turn off the clipping and walk under or through the rock. The fish will usually follow\u00a0them out. After that, turn clipping back on and complete the quest.\nIssue #3: A slaughterfish is found at the arrow, but it doesn't have a scale.\nSolution: To fix this issue without the console (for Xbox360 and PS3 users, mainly), simply abandon the quest for around three days, this will allow the slaughterfish to respawn, giving it the scale needed to complete the quest.\nUnfriendly Competition.\nIn the quest\u00a0&lt;a href=\"Unfriendly%20Competition\"&gt;Unfriendly Competition&lt;/a&gt;, sometimes it is difficult to find the required evidence shovel in the Mausoleum. It is\u00a0not the shovel that is at &lt;a href=\"Agarmir\"&gt;Agarmir&lt;/a&gt;'s house. Look around the mausoleum carefully, as things can fly around during battle. Especially check dark corners.\nIt is also possible that if\u00a0the player\u00a0goes into the mausoleum and attacks &lt;a href=\"Agarmir\"&gt;Agarmir&lt;/a&gt; or his partner, then a guard will give\u00a0them the normal \"Jail, Resist, Fine\" options. If\u00a0they choose Jail or Fine, the mausoleum will require a key. If\u00a0they choose to resist,\u00a0they must defeat all three enemies.\nLost Histories.\nIssue: When clicking \"map,\" it shows no arrow for &lt;a href=\"Shum%20gro-Yarug\"&gt;Shum gro-Yarug&lt;/a&gt;. This may apply to both the \"&lt;a href=\"Lost%20Histories\"&gt;Lost Histories&lt;/a&gt;\" quest, and the quest to buy the &lt;a href=\"Houses%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;house&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Skingrad%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;Skingrad&lt;/a&gt;. The quest arrow just points\u00a0the player\u00a0to a road, and upon arriving at the arrow,\u00a0they find nothing. Therefore,\u00a0they cannot finish either quest.\nShum gro-Yarug\u00a0actually falls off of the bridge and dies, and where his body landed is where the arrow is pointing for the house quest.\nSolution: The best way to fix this is to either: 1) use the &lt;a href=\"Console%20Commands%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;console&lt;/a&gt; to summon him with his &lt;a href=\"Characters%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;NPC ID&lt;/a&gt;, or 2) find his NPC HEX ID, point to it, and use the resurrect command. After some time he showed up walking on the road. Enter the console, and type the following:\nAnother way to bypass this bug (for Lost Histories only) is to ignore the chance to fake the job, and instead, go to the Skingrad prison and pickpocket the dungeon key from the jailor, then carry on as if Shum gro-Yarug never died. The reason this works is because the game only recognizes opening a locked door (like the door to the cells) as a crime if a lockpick or the Skeleton Key is used, because the appropriate key is used, unlocking the door is not seen as a crime. (This is useful for Xbox 360 and PS3 users)\nMankar Camoran's Paradise.\nIssue: Mankar Camoran does not appear in the building at the end of the &lt;a href=\"Paradise%20%28Quest%29\"&gt;Paradise&lt;/a&gt; mission. Instead, he seems to be wandering around the inside of Cloud Ruler Temple, and\u00a0the player is\u00a0unable to attack or pickpocket him. He just asks them, without voice acting, to \"enter the hall\" to challenge him.\u00a0The player\u00a0cannot complete the Paradise mission because of this.\nSolution: If\u00a0the player is\u00a0experiencing this glitch it is because Mankar Camoran is stuck either in Lake Arrius Caverns, at the Dagon Shrine, or he sometimes gets stuck at Cloud Ruler Temple. First\u00a0the player\u00a0needs to find him either at Cloud Ruler Temple or at the Dagon Shrine inside Lake Arrius Caverns. If he is at Cloud Ruler Temple he should be in the main room where Martin is. Save before entering Lake Arrius Caverns, and do not attack anyone but Mankar.\u00a0The player\u00a0has to run straight to Mankar without attacking anyone else. Speak to Mankar, and then start attacking, loot his body and grab the Amulet of Kings. After a few seconds the loading window will show up, and\u00a0the player\u00a0will be back at Cloud Ruler Temple with a message saying the\u00a0they defeated Mankar and that the portal to paradise has been\u00a0closed.\n&lt;a href=\"Shrine%20of%20Clavicus%20Vile\"&gt;Shrine of Clavicus Vile&lt;/a&gt; quest bug.\nIssue: When attempting to return the Umbra Sword to Clavicus Vile's shrine for his quest, both PC and Xbox 360 versions of the game crash. The crash has something to do with the statue that &lt;a href=\"Clavicus%20Vile\"&gt;Clavicus Vile&lt;/a&gt; will give\u00a0the player\u00a0to carry with while\u00a0they do his quest. The crash occurs when this statue has to be placed back onto the shrine pedestal from\u00a0the inventory. At the end of the quest when\u00a0they go back and talk to the shrine again, whether\u00a0they give the sword, or keep it, when the statue gets removed from\u00a0the inventory, the game crashes. This is confirmed on the PC version as well.\nSolution: The latest &lt;a href=\"Patches%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;patch&lt;/a&gt; fixes this quest. If it does not fix, keep reading:\nBefore ever talking to the &lt;a href=\"Shrine%20of%20Clavicus%20Vile\"&gt;Shrine of Clavicus Vile&lt;/a&gt;, go to &lt;a href=\"Vindasel\"&gt;Vindasel&lt;/a&gt;, here\u00a0the player\u00a0can find Umbra with her sword. Defeat her and take the sword, then go talk to the Khajiit worshiper by the shrine. This will add the Clavicus Vile quest to\u00a0the journal.\u00a0They can then speak with the shrine, and he will immediately say, \"You've found the sword!\" He will take the sword and\u00a0they will not have to do his quest. Do this and\u00a0they will not have the glitch with the statue having to get removed from\u00a0the inventory.\nIt may also be possible to get around the bug by making sure that the sword Umbra is not currently equipped. This seems to have worked on the PC version of the game. It is recommended\u00a0to try this method first, as another lucrative quest may hinge on the completion of this line.\nFor\u00a0players who do not want to have to reach level 20 this is a good alternative. One simply has to receive the quest and activate the shrine without the loss of gold.\nAnother possibility is to use wait. Immediately after returning the sword to Clavicus but just prior to the Baucus's parting remarks, simply \"wait\" for an hour. This has the effect of \"time-warping\" the character past the final remarks, so they are never given. The game may still lock up later if\u00a0the player\u00a0ever returns to the shrine again, however.\nAdditionally, for the path of keeping the sword,\u00a0the player\u00a0can try and warp to the Waterfront District. The seller's words should interrupt those of Baucus (the dog) and allow\u00a0them to continue (tested only on 360). This doesn't seem to work when\u00a0they accept the Masque.\nAnother solution is to simply have the Umbra sword in\u00a0the inventory before going to the &lt;a href=\"Shrine%20of%20Clavicus%20Vile\"&gt;Shrine of Clavicus Vile&lt;/a&gt;. When\u00a0the player\u00a0travels to the shrine with the Umbra sword, do not\u00a0talk to the shrine. Instead, talk to the &lt;a href=\"Khajiit%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;Khajiit&lt;/a&gt; nearby and tell him\u00a0they have the sword. He will tell\u00a0them to approach the shrine.\u00a0They have the choice to keep the Umbra, or exchange it for the &lt;a href=\"Clavicus%20Vile%27s%20Masque\"&gt;Clavicus Vile's Masque&lt;/a&gt;, this mask somewhat resembles a samurai faceplate and is the only mask in the game. (Note: This solution has been confirmed and is guaranteed to work).\nA final option, if any of the above does not work is to travel to the East gate of Cheydinhal. As soon\u00a0the player\u00a0gives or does not give the blade to Clavicus immediately pause the game to the Journal and travel to the East gate. As soon\u00a0they spawn to Cheydinhal the Dog Statuette will start talking and will head back to the shrine and will leave\u00a0the inventory without freezing the game. (This has been confirmed.) Fast traveling to the Market District can also stop this glitch from happening (Player note: just confirmed on Xbox 360 pre-patch).\nWabbajack glitch.\nIssue: When the player uses the &lt;a href=\"Wabbajack%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;Wabbajack&lt;/a&gt; to transmute their own horse, they are simultaneously kicked out of every guild they have joined. Each message claims that they have stolen from another guild member, except the one for the &lt;a href=\"Dark%20Brotherhood%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;Dark Brotherhood&lt;/a&gt;, which only says they have broken one of the tenets. The suspected reason for this is that since it is the horse, it belongs to all the factions the player is in.\nIssue: If the player used the Wabbajack on something they have summoned, then kill it (before it changes back), it may sometimes return to its original form, but the corpse will remain and be lootable.\nSee the Gray Fox's Face before completing The Ultimate Heist.\nThe player can take the Gray Fox Cowl off of the &lt;a href=\"The%20Gray%20Fox%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;Gray Fox&lt;/a&gt; before they receive it for completing the Thieves Guild. The player needs a mage's hood. Any will do as long as it is zero-weight (they can buy one from Rindir's Staffs).\nAnvil Recommendation.\nSometimes, when the player is battling &lt;a href=\"Caminalda\"&gt;Caminalda&lt;/a&gt;, the rogue mage in the \"Anvil Recommendation\" quest, an Imperial Legion Soldier will walk by on patrol. Due to the fact that, even if Caminalda is attacking, she is considered a civilian (community faction), and the guard will kill anyone attacking her. This includes the two battle mages assisting the player on their quest. If they attack her, the guard will tell them they have violated the law and will give them the arrest prompt.\nSolution: If the player sees a guard near the place where Caminalda attacks them, wait until he leaves the area, and resume the mission like normal.\nCannot select a target while in console.\nIssue: When the console is open, the player is unable to click-on an object or character, the background is the only thing that is selected. It shows up as \"\" &lt;ID&gt; instead of \"[name of object/character]\" &lt;ID&gt;. This problem with selecting a target in console means that certain console commands cannot be used, such as the 'kill' command.\n&lt;solution needed&gt;\nStretchy pull rope.\n When the player embarks upon the Daedric Prince &lt;a href=\"Azura\"&gt;Azura&lt;/a&gt;'s &lt;a href=\"Azura%20%28Quest%29\"&gt;quest&lt;/a&gt;, they will be required to travel to Gutted Mine, southwest of the &lt;a href=\"Shrine%20of%20Azura%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;Shrine of Azura&lt;/a&gt;, and it can only be unlocked by starting Azura's quest. Once they go inside, they will have to fight three &lt;a href=\"Vampire%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;vampires&lt;/a&gt;, all dubbed &lt;a href=\"Afflicted%20Brethren\"&gt;Afflicted Brethren&lt;/a&gt;. After defeating them, the player will encounter a rock wall and a pull rope, which appears as a rock attached to a rope. When they activate it, the wall moves out of the way and the player is free to enter. If they examine the pull rope at this point, it will start slowly spinning, and if they touch it, it violently stretches and flies around the room, bouncing off the walls endlessly.\nNOTE: This may happen with certain roots in various caves.\nThis has only been confirmed on the XBOX version, and there is no way to fix it.\nPermanent familiar.\nIf the player is able to summon a &lt;a href=\"Flesh%20Atronach%20%28Shivering%20Isles%29\"&gt;Flesh Atronach&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Golden%20Saint%20%28Shivering%20Isles%29\"&gt;Golden Saint&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"Dark%20Seducer%20%28Shivering%20Isles%29\"&gt;Dark Seducer&lt;/a&gt;, then immediately after they summon it and walk through a door, then wait for one hour twice. If the player then returns to where they summoned the being, then it will not say\"-name-'s atronach\" and so on.\n&lt;solution needed&gt;"}

In the tradition of Thirsk chieftains before her, she became leader after she slew the great beast of Ilfark and presented its stomach as a battle trophy.\nInteractions.\n&lt;a href=\"Retaking%20Thirsk\"&gt;Retaking Thirsk&lt;/a&gt;.\nBujold and her group of Nords can be found at &lt;a href=\"Bujold%27s%20Retreat\"&gt;Bujold's Retreat&lt;/a&gt; along the eastern shore of &lt;a href=\"Solstheim%20%28Dragonborn%29\"&gt;Solstheim&lt;/a&gt;, a short distance south of &lt;a href=\"Skaal%20Village%20%28Dragonborn%29\"&gt;Skaal Village&lt;/a&gt;. Upon speaking to Bujold, she reveals that her group has been kicked out of &lt;a href=\"Thirsk%20Mead%20Hall%20%28Dragonborn%29\"&gt;Thirsk Mead Hall&lt;/a&gt;, located up on the hill near the &lt;a href=\"Beast%20Stone%20%28Dragonborn%29\"&gt;Beast Stone&lt;/a&gt;, by a group of &lt;a href=\"Riekling%20%28Dragonborn%29\"&gt;Rieklings&lt;/a&gt; led by their &lt;a href=\"Riekling%20Chief\"&gt;chief&lt;/a&gt;. When the &lt;a href=\"Last%20Dragonborn\"&gt;Last Dragonborn&lt;/a&gt; offers to help her group retake the mead hall from the Rieklings, she rallies her fellow Nords to join her and the Dragonborn with taking their mead hall back. Once the Rieklings and their chief have been slain, Bujold asks the Dragonborn to accompany her to &lt;a href=\"Hrothmund%27s%20Barrow%20%28Dragonborn%29\"&gt;Hrothmund's Barrow&lt;/a&gt; to witness her being dubbed leader of the mead hall again. However, once there, the voice of Hrothmund speaks to her and refuses to grant her leadership of the mead hall, disappointed in her and her Nords for letting themselves become soft and losing the mead hall to the Rieklings in the first place. Afterwards, Bujold decides to start a new tradition at the mead hall and go against Hrothmund's wishes. The Dragonborn can either agree to keep what happened at the barrow a secret, thus allowing Bujold to remain leader, or refuse, forcing Bujold to have to fight the Dragonborn to keep them from telling the truth to &lt;a href=\"Kuvar\"&gt;Kuvar&lt;/a&gt; and the others, resulting in her death.\n&lt;a href=\"The%20Chief%20of%20Thirsk%20Hall\"&gt;The Chief of Thirsk Hall&lt;/a&gt;.\nIf the &lt;a href=\"Last%20Dragonborn\"&gt;Last Dragonborn&lt;/a&gt; decides to aid the &lt;a href=\"Riekling%20Chief\"&gt;Riekling Chief&lt;/a&gt; who is in control of Thirsk Mead Hall, the chief will ask the Dragonborn to join his rieklings with traveling down to &lt;a href=\"Bujold%27s%20Retreat\"&gt;Bujold's Retreat&lt;/a&gt; and killing Bujold and her Nords to prove themselves kin to the rieklings.\nDialogue.\n\"I don't really have time for this.\"\n\"Until next time.\"\nBujold: \"Hey, you lazy milk-drinkers, get over here!

It is I, Bujold. You blessed me in the past, and now I've rid the hall of Rieklings and returned it to its rightful owners.\"\nHrothmund's Spirit: \"And well it is that this has happened. But I have always watched, and know that it was your softness that lead to your own exile. You allowed your fellow warriors to grow weak while the dangers around you mounted.\"\nBujold the Unworthy: \"Then... the leadership is not mine?\"\nHrothmund's Spirit: \"No. Nor is there any among you fit to serve. For a band in the wilderness, it is better to have no leader than a poor one.\"\nBujold the Unworthy: \"\"It won't be that easy to get rid of the Rieklings, &lt;a href=\"Kuvar\"&gt;Kuvar&lt;/a&gt;.\"\"\nKuvar: \"I never said it would be.

What are we doing here? We should either get used to staying here, or be preparing to take the hall.

And soon.\"\nKuvar: \"I wish you could just relax a little...\"\nBujold the Unworthy: \"I don't want to get comfortable here. We need to be back up there.\"\nKuvar: \"This is a decent spot. We're right on the water. This could grow into something respectable.\"\nBujold the Unworthy: \"Thirsk was respectable. And we let this happen. No, we'll get respect the way it should come.\"\nKuvar: \"Bujold. Your second claims that Hrothmund did not yield a blessing to you. Is that true?\"\nBujold the Intrepid: \"My second would do well to keep his mouth shut.\"\nKuvar: \"So... you don't deny this?\"\nBujold the Intrepid: \"Kuvar, listen to me. You said yourself that this place had lost sight of its past. We need a new tradition, to move us forward. Instead of listening to a ghost in a tomb, we should steer our own destinies.\"\nKuvar: \"Your words carry some wisdom. But if you truly believed in the spirit of Thirsk, you would have spoken them honestly. Instead you hid your shame.\"\nBujold the Intrepid: \"Kuvar, I...\"\nKuvar: \"Just... I can't even look at you right now. Get out of here. Run to the wilds.\"\nBujold the Intrepid: \"Kuvar, I'm your wife. You can't...\"\nKuvar: \"And so I feel your shame all the more deeply. When it's time, we will seek you out. Until then, go and attempt to earn your honor in the old ways.\"\nBujold the Intrepid: \"I don't want you harassing Hilund anymore.\"\nKuvar: \"I'm not harassing her. She just needs to decide what kind of person she wants to be.\"\nBujold the Intrepid: \"And I don't think she needs any help from you to do that.\"\nKuvar: \"Why so touchy on this?\"\nBujold the Intrepid: \"Just... leave her be.

He leads the &lt;a href=\"City%20Watch\"&gt;city's guard&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;a href=\"Defense%20of%20Bruma%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;Defense of Bruma&lt;/a&gt; during the &lt;a href=\"Oblivion%20Crisis\"&gt;Oblivion Crisis&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"3E%20433\"&gt;3E 433&lt;/a&gt;.\nBiography.\nWhen Burd joined the Bruma guard is unknown. He is notable for being the only Nord guard in a primarily Nordic city. As Captain, Burd instructs his men to respect the local Nords and their customs; the townspeople consider him tough, but fair. He also serves as an advisor to &lt;a href=\"Narina%20Carvain\"&gt;Countess Carvain&lt;/a&gt;.\nOblivion Crisis.\nShortly after the start of the Crisis, &lt;a href=\"Mythic%20Dawn\"&gt;Mythic Dawn&lt;/a&gt; spies began operating in Bruma, probing for weaknesses in nearby &lt;a href=\"Cloud%20Ruler%20Temple%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;Cloud Ruler Temple&lt;/a&gt; in preparation for an assault. Though Burd and his guard fear that spies have infiltrated the city, they have little information to go on. Burd is suspicious of &lt;a href=\"Jearl\"&gt;Jearl&lt;/a&gt;, however, who has recently returned from a trip. Hoping to find evidence of espionage, Burd grants the &lt;a href=\"Hero%20of%20Kvatch\"&gt;Hero&lt;/a&gt; permission to search Jearl's house. Inside is proof that the spies are in the city and that they plan to attack Bruma and Cloud Ruler Temple by opening a &lt;a href=\"Great%20Oblivion%20Gate\"&gt;Great Oblivion Gate&lt;/a&gt;.\nAfter learning of this plot, Burd keeps the town guard on high alert, doing whatever he can to prevent Bruma from becoming another &lt;a href=\"Kvatch%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;Kvatch&lt;/a&gt;. When &lt;a href=\"Oblivion%20Gate%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;Oblivion gates&lt;/a&gt; begin opening near the city, Burd quickly marshals Bruma's forces; he then enters the first gate to see what awaits them.\nWhen Burd learns how to close the gates, he puts the guard on constant alert to prevent &lt;a href=\"Daedra\"&gt;Daedra&lt;/a&gt; from overrunning the city. He also communicates with the &lt;a href=\"Blades%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;Blades&lt;/a&gt; at Cloud Ruler Temple.\nBurd fights alongside the rest of the defenders to protect the town during the Battle of Bruma while the Hero goes inside to close the Great Oblivion Gate.\nPersonality.\nBurd is a tough, determined guardsman, motivated above all else by dedication to his post; his concern for Bruma gives him pause when confronted with &lt;a href=\"Martin%20Septim%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;Martin Septim's&lt;/a&gt; plan. Burd seems to feel a sense of kinship with his fellow Nords in Bruma, whom he instructs his guard to respect as much as possible.\nBurd is a strong man, wielding a large &lt;a href=\"Steel%20Claymore%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;steel claymore&lt;/a&gt; in battle. He also displays prowess in &lt;a href=\"Restoration%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;Restoration&lt;/a&gt; magic, healing himself when necessary.\nDialogue.\n\"What can I do for you?\"\n\"Be seeing you.\"\nConversations.\n&lt;a href=\"Bruma%20Gate\"&gt;Bruma Gate&lt;/a&gt;.\nBruma Guard: \"You did it, Captain! You closed the Oblivion Gate! We didn't think we'd ever see you alive again!\"\nBurd: \"Believe me, it was no picnic. But thanks to our friend here, I now know we can close these hell-gates. We can defend Bruma!\"\nDefending Bruma.\nCountess Narina Carvain: \"Burd! Deploy the troops for battle!\"\nBurd: \"As you command, Countess.\""}

During a failed incursion into &lt;a href=\"Moss%20Mother%20Cavern\"&gt;Moss Mother Cavern&lt;/a&gt;, Ari and their friend &lt;a href=\"Niels%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Niels&lt;/a&gt; were killed by a &lt;a href=\"Spriggan%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;spriggan&lt;/a&gt;, leaving Valdr wounded and unable to return home.\nAcquisition.\nDuring \"&lt;a href=\"Hunter%20and%20Hunted%20%28Quest%29\"&gt;Hunter and Hunted&lt;/a&gt;\" quest, assisting Valdr in killing the remaining spriggans in Moss Mother Cavern so that he may bury his friends will prompt him to bestow the dagger as a reward and a gift of thanks.\nEnchantment.\nThe dagger's inherent properties grants a 25% chance of a critical hit with each strike. The effect itself is not considered to be an enchantment, so the weapon cannot be disenchanted to learn the effect. In addition, it is affected by\u00a0&lt;a href=\"Elemental%20Fury\"&gt;Elemental Fury&lt;/a&gt;.\nCritical hits.\nWhile the 25% chance of a critical hit may appear beneficial, the effect is less impressive at higher levels as critical hits only affects the base damage of the weapon. A critical hit multiplies the damage of an attack by 1.5. This means a critical hit with this dagger will only add 2.5 points of damage to the existing hit. One-Handed skill, &lt;a href=\"Perks%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;perks&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"Smithing%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;smithing&lt;/a&gt; improvements do not increase critical damage:\nUsefulness.\nWhen combined with the\u00a0&lt;a href=\"Assassin%27s%20Blade%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Assassin's Blade&lt;/a&gt; perk and &lt;a href=\"Ancient%20Shrouded%20Gloves\"&gt;Ancient Shrouded Gloves&lt;/a&gt; (or &lt;a href=\"Shrouded%20Hand%20Wraps\"&gt;Shrouded Hand Wraps&lt;/a&gt;), the critical hit triggered by a &lt;a href=\"Sneak%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;sneak&lt;/a&gt; attack combined with a critical hit can be very devastating, along with its light weight and easy smithing, making it a deadly weapon for assassins.\nSmithing.\nIt can be upgraded with a &lt;a href=\"Steel%20Ingot%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;steel ingot&lt;/a&gt; at a &lt;a href=\"grindstone\"&gt;grindstone&lt;/a&gt; and also benefits from the &lt;a href=\"Steel%20Smithing\"&gt;Steel Smithing&lt;/a&gt; perk, which doubles the improvement. The &lt;a href=\"Arcane%20Blacksmith\"&gt;Arcane Blacksmith&lt;/a&gt; perk is not required, as the dagger is not actually enchanted."}

It lies west of &lt;a href=\"Elsweyr\"&gt;Elsweyr&lt;/a&gt;, southwest of &lt;a href=\"Cyrodiil\"&gt;Cyrodiil&lt;/a&gt;, and east of the &lt;a href=\"Abecean%20Sea\"&gt;Abecean Sea&lt;/a&gt;.\nPeople.\nBosmer.\nThe Bosmer are the major species in Valenwood. Their strict \"&lt;a href=\"Green%20Pact\"&gt;Green Pact&lt;/a&gt;\" prohibits the use of wood or other vegetable derivatives as building materials. This pact also has other such rules as that a fallen enemy must be completely consumed before three days pass. They also cannot smoke anything of a vegetable nature. Bone pipes are common, however, and are filled with caterpillars or tree grubs. \nThe Bosmer are one of the smallest races in Tamriel with males being smaller than females. They are born with skin colors ranging from light brown to pale tan to light green. Some Bosmer also may have horns. They are known to be extremely agile and quick. Their nimbleness serves them best in any art involving thievery. Many are well respected &lt;a href=\"Archery\"&gt;archers&lt;/a&gt;, due to their inherent mastery of the bow.\nThey also have a deep-seated fear of &lt;a href=\"Necromancy\"&gt;Necromancy&lt;/a&gt;.\nImga.\nThe Great Apes, or &lt;a href=\"Imga\"&gt;Imga&lt;/a&gt;, are native beastfolk of Valenwood. They see the High Elves as their lords and masters, and as a portrait of an ideal, civilized society. Great Apes go to desperate measures to emulate the High Elves: they wear capes, practice with the dueling sword, and attempt to speak with perfect enunciation and courtly manners despite their gravelly, baritone voices. \nEach Imga bears some kind of title, be it Baron, Duke, Earl, or the like, which they use when addressing the members of the &lt;a href=\"Thalmor\"&gt;Thalmor&lt;/a&gt;. There are no landowning Imga.\nThe Hollow.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Hollow\"&gt;Hollow&lt;/a&gt; are a unique sentient race that serve the &lt;a href=\"Wilderking\"&gt;Wilderking&lt;/a&gt;. They are made from stone and the reanimated bodies from deceased inhabitants of Valenwood. No Hollows are free-willed, save for &lt;a href=\"Sumiril\"&gt;Sumiril&lt;/a&gt;, who was the first Hollow created by the Valenwood and a powerful &lt;a href=\"Altmer\"&gt;Altmer&lt;/a&gt; named Ostion.\nGovernment.\nCamoran Dynasty.\nThe Camoran Dynasty is the ruling royal family of Valenwood, and one of the oldest Empires on Tamriel.\nThe Dynasty itself is split into the treethanes of &lt;a href=\"Falinesti\"&gt;Falinesti&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Silvenar%20%28City%29\"&gt;Silvenar&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Haven\"&gt;Haven&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Archen\"&gt;Archen&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Elden%20Root\"&gt;Eldenroot&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Woodhearth\"&gt;Woodhearth&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Karthdar\"&gt;Karthdar&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Greenhill\"&gt;Greenhill&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Deepwoods\"&gt;Deepwoods&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Tanglehaven\"&gt;Tanglehaven&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Bramblebreach\"&gt;Bramblebreach&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Willowgrove\"&gt;Willowgrove&lt;/a&gt;. The ancient &lt;a href=\"Camoran%20Throne\"&gt;Camoran throne&lt;/a&gt; is somewhere in the highest branches of Falinesti; the walking city of the &lt;a href=\"Bosmer\"&gt;Bosmer&lt;/a&gt; king.\nThe Camoran Dynasty was founded by King &lt;a href=\"Eplear\"&gt;Eplear&lt;/a&gt; of Valenwood on Year Zero of the &lt;a href=\"First%20Era\"&gt;First Era&lt;/a&gt;. Eplear's success in uniting the Bosmer is counted among the greatest military feats in Tamriel's history.\nMilitary.\nDominion Military.\nAlthough Valenwood doesn't appear to have a unified military force of it's own, for much of it's history it has been part of and protected by the Dominion Military.\nThe Dominion Military is a military force made up of soldiers from the three provinces of the Aldmeri Dominion: Summerset Isles, Valenwood and Elsweyr. Each race is also known to use a variety of different tactics in one-on-one combat. The &lt;a href=\"Bosmer\"&gt;Bosmer&lt;/a&gt; are known to attack from different sides or use &lt;a href=\"bows\"&gt;bows&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"arrows\"&gt;arrows&lt;/a&gt; to defeat their opponent.\nGeography.\nValenwood has a largely uninhabited forest wilderness. The coasts of Valenwood are dominated by mangrove swamps and sub-tropical rain forests, while heavy rainfalls nurture the temperate inland rain forests. The Bosmer live in clan-houses at sites scattered along the coast and through the interior, connected only by undeveloped foot trails. The few Imperial roads traverse vast dense woodlands, studded with tiny, widely separated settlements, and carry little trade or traffic of any kind. Furthermore, the nation is home to giant, migratory trees, such as &lt;a href=\"Falinesti\"&gt;Falinesti&lt;/a&gt;, that house their cities.\nMuch of the region is impenetrable mangrove and coastal rain forest, with few grasslands or glade areas until further north near the \"&lt;a href=\"Gold%20Coast\"&gt;Strident Coast&lt;/a&gt;\". It is \"a sea of endless green, a maze of foliage with half-hidden cities growing like blooms from a flower,\" and \"the home of the Bosmer is Tamriel's garden\" &lt;a href=\"Domica%20Redwort\"&gt;Domica Redwort&lt;/a&gt; is an herb grown by many residents of Valenwood for their beautiful and showy flowers. They attain a height of about three feet and have feathery leaves; the flowers are usually bright red. In addition to their beauty, they are said to have magical abilities to enhance the appearance of anyone who carries or wears one of the flowers.\nHistory.\nValenwood was claimed as a wasteland province of the &lt;a href=\"Second%20Empire\"&gt;Second Empire&lt;/a&gt;, and its geography is partially described in several Imperial surveys. Valenwood is noteworthy in that it has no cities or townships built by the &lt;a href=\"Bosmer\"&gt;Wood Elves&lt;/a&gt; themselves. The Wood Elves permitted a few roads to be built by the Second Empire, but neglect their maintenance, as the Bosmer do not need roads to move easily through the thickest forest. These roads would be now overgrown were it not for the &lt;a href=\"Altmer\"&gt;High Elves&lt;/a&gt; of the &lt;a href=\"Thalmor\"&gt;Thalmor&lt;/a&gt;, who have repaired and widened them for rapid passage of their arms to and from the coast.\n&lt;a href=\"First%20Era\"&gt;First Era&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe first Era was founded after King &lt;a href=\"Eplear\"&gt;Eplear&lt;/a&gt;, a Bosmer, and founder of the &lt;a href=\"Camoran%20Dynasty\"&gt;Camoran Dynasty&lt;/a&gt;, began his rule. Soon after this founding, the Bosmeri began to change, to suit the environments of the forest in which they lived. In return for the patronage of &lt;a href=\"Y%27ffre\"&gt;Y'ffre&lt;/a&gt;, the Forest God (either one of the old ancestor spirits or an aspect of the true pantheon), they swore never to kill, injure, or eat any of the vegetation of the new home, which became known as the &lt;a href=\"Green%20Pact\"&gt;Green Pact&lt;/a&gt;. The Bosmeri unity should be considered an important military feat in itself, as Eplear managed to unify the disparate groups into a unified group. In &lt;a href=\"1E%20340\"&gt;1E 340&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"Camoran%20Dynasty\"&gt;Camoran Dynasty&lt;/a&gt; formed a trade pact with the human slave rebels of the &lt;a href=\"Alessian%20Order\"&gt;Alessian Order&lt;/a&gt;. This they then were forced to undo in &lt;a href=\"1E%20369\"&gt;1E 369&lt;/a&gt;, with one of the &lt;a href=\"Wild%20Hunt\"&gt;Wild Hunt&lt;/a&gt;s killing king &lt;a href=\"Borgas\"&gt;Borgas&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"Skyrim\"&gt;Skyrim&lt;/a&gt;, who was planning on declaring war on the Bosmer. Valenwood was able to maintain its independence for the majority of the First Era. It was only in &lt;a href=\"1E%202714\"&gt;1E 2714&lt;/a&gt;, after unrelenting warfare from the Cyrodiil's and Colovia combined, coupled with the devastating effects of the &lt;a href=\"Thrassian%20Plague\"&gt;Thrassian Plague&lt;/a&gt;, that finally brought the Camoran Dynasty into the &lt;a href=\"Reman%20Empire\"&gt;Reman Empire&lt;/a&gt;. Reman then ensured that Valenwood would not be a threat to the &lt;a href=\"Second%20Empire\"&gt;Second Empire&lt;/a&gt; by raising the cities of &lt;a href=\"Falinesti\"&gt;Falinesti&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Silvenar%20%28City%29\"&gt;Silvenar&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Haven\"&gt;Haven&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Archen\"&gt;Archen&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Elden%20Root\"&gt;Elden Root&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Woodhearth\"&gt;Woodhearth&lt;/a&gt; from local trading posts to full-fledged powers in their own right. As well as these, three other cities were granted city-state status, which made Valenwood as a whole easier to govern.\n&lt;a href=\"Second%20Era\"&gt;Second Era&lt;/a&gt;.\nAfter the fall of the &lt;a href=\"Second%20Empire\"&gt;Second Empire&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"2E%20430\"&gt;2E 430&lt;/a&gt;, the Camorans tried to unify themselves once more under the one banner, however, they had drifted too far apart culturally. They then began to war with one another, the Khajiit to the east, and the Colovians to the north. As they were disunified, they offered no resistance to the encroachments made by the &lt;a href=\"Maormer\"&gt;Maormer&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"Pyandonea\"&gt;Pyandonea&lt;/a&gt;.\nDuring the 5th Century, the &lt;a href=\"Camoran%20Dynasty\"&gt;Camoran Dynasty&lt;/a&gt; had reasserted itself, and, with the exception of the &lt;a href=\"Blacksap%20Rebellion\"&gt;Blacksap Rebellion&lt;/a&gt;, managed to assert &lt;a href=\"Elden%20Root\"&gt;Elden Root&lt;/a&gt; as the capital. This would become the capital of the &lt;a href=\"Aldmeri%20Dominion%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Aldmeri Dominion&lt;/a&gt;.\nHuman settlements.\nThe majority of human outposts built during the time of the &lt;a href=\"Second%20Empire\"&gt;Second Empire&lt;/a&gt; have been abandoned during the &lt;a href=\"Interregnum\"&gt;Interregnum&lt;/a&gt;, and have been reclaimed instead by \"&lt;a href=\"beastfolk\"&gt;beastfolk&lt;/a&gt;\" such as &lt;a href=\"Centaur\"&gt;Centaur&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"Orsimer\"&gt;Orcs&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Imga\"&gt;Imga&lt;/a&gt; - that share the forests with the Bosmer tribes. Humans, in general, have learned not to intrude in the forests of Valenwood. While they once depended entirely on the annual &lt;a href=\"Stridmeet\"&gt;Stridmeet&lt;/a&gt; caravans of the &lt;a href=\"Colovian%20West\"&gt;Colovian West&lt;/a&gt;, the Wood Elves now rely entirely on the sea power of the &lt;a href=\"Second%20Aldmeri%20Dominion\"&gt;Aldmeri Dominion&lt;/a&gt; for whatever they require from the outside world (As of &lt;a href=\"2E%20864\"&gt;2E 864&lt;/a&gt;).\nFor a brief period of time, the &lt;a href=\"Colovian\"&gt;Colovian&lt;/a&gt; armies used Bosmer Archers, such as in the &lt;a href=\"War%20of%20Rihad\"&gt;War of Rihad&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"2E%20862\"&gt;2E 862&lt;/a&gt;, however they were highly undisciplined and prone to desertion to be of significant use. They are quite adept at sneaking, and one of their most famous poems, the &lt;a href=\"Meh%20Ayleidion\"&gt;Meh Ayleidion&lt;/a&gt; literally means \"The One Thousand Benefits of Hiding\".\n&lt;a href=\"Second%20Aldmeri%20Dominion\"&gt;Aldmeri Dominion&lt;/a&gt;.\nValenwood also became part of the &lt;a href=\"Second%20Aldmeri%20Dominion\"&gt;Aldmeri Dominion&lt;/a&gt;, a coalition of the &lt;a href=\"Altmer\"&gt;Altmer&lt;/a&gt; and Bosmer that was considered to be the most stable empire in Tamriel, and they ruled until the armies of &lt;a href=\"Tiber%20Septim\"&gt;Tiber Septim&lt;/a&gt; wiped them out.\n&lt;a href=\"Third%20Era\"&gt;Third Era&lt;/a&gt;.\nAfter conquering Valenwood, Tiber Septim wisely decided to let the Bosmeri retain some symbols of its independence, so as to limit dissension. Thus, they allowed the creation of local chiefs and the &lt;a href=\"Camoran%20Dynasty\"&gt;Camoran Kings&lt;/a&gt; to remain.\nThey are recorded as having been involved in the &lt;a href=\"War%20of%20the%20Red%20Diamond\"&gt;War of the Red Diamond&lt;/a&gt;, along with the provinces of &lt;a href=\"Hammerfell\"&gt;Hammerfell&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Summerset%20Isle\"&gt;Summerset Isle&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Elsweyr\"&gt;Elsweyr&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Black%20Marsh\"&gt;Black Marsh&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Skyrim\"&gt;Skyrim&lt;/a&gt;, and although it is not explicitly mentioned which side they fought on, it is likely that they went to the aid of Emperor &lt;a href=\"Cephorus%20Septim\"&gt;Cephorus Septim I&lt;/a&gt;. However, the war itself left Valenwood unscathed.\nCamoran Usurper.\nAlso known as &lt;a href=\"Haymon%20Camoran\"&gt;Haymon Camoran&lt;/a&gt;, Hart-King, and Camoran Hart-King, the Camoran Usurper began his deadly attacks on Valenwood in &lt;a href=\"3E%20249\"&gt;3E 249&lt;/a&gt;. Two years later, in &lt;a href=\"3E%20251\"&gt;3E 251&lt;/a&gt;, the Camoran Usurper had conquered all of Valenwood, and began his fateful march northwards before eventually getting defeated at the &lt;a href=\"Battle%20of%20Firewaves\"&gt;Battle of Firewaves&lt;/a&gt; by Baron &lt;a href=\"Othrok\"&gt;Othrok&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"Dwynnen\"&gt;Dwynnen&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"3E%20267\"&gt;3E 267&lt;/a&gt;.\n&lt;a href=\"Five%20Year%20War\"&gt;Five Year War&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe Five Year War, lasting, as it did, from &lt;a href=\"3E%20395\"&gt;3E 395&lt;/a&gt; until its conclusion in &lt;a href=\"3E%20399\"&gt;3E 399&lt;/a&gt;, was a serious conflict between &lt;a href=\"Elsweyr\"&gt;Elsweyr&lt;/a&gt; and Valenwood. More details are available on the main article of this War.\n&lt;a href=\"War%20of%20the%20Blue%20Divide\"&gt;War of the Blue Divide&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe War of the Blue Divide was a war between the &lt;a href=\"Altmer\"&gt;Altmer&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"Summerset%20Isles\"&gt;Summerset Isles&lt;/a&gt; and those of the Bosmer of Valenwood. More details are available on the main page.\nOther changes.\nAt the close of the Third Era (as at &lt;a href=\"3E%20432\"&gt;3E 432&lt;/a&gt;, anyway), significant changes were occurring in Valenwood. The &lt;a href=\"Wild%20Hunt\"&gt;Wild Hunt&lt;/a&gt; had been sighted again for the first time in \"over 500 years.\" The \"Walking City\" of &lt;a href=\"Falinesti\"&gt;Falinesti&lt;/a&gt; has taken root for the first time in recorded history, and there is a new Bosmer prophet, the &lt;a href=\"Precursor\"&gt;Precursor&lt;/a&gt;, preaching that the old Forest God &lt;a href=\"Y%27ffre\"&gt;Y'ffre&lt;/a&gt; is returning with new gifts for his favored people. Whether these are isolated events, or signs of some great change coming to Valenwood, remains to be seen.\nFourth Era.\nSeeking to recreate the Aldmeri Dominion, the Thalmor expanded their power into the provinces of Valenwood, Elsweyr, and briefly into &lt;a href=\"Cyrodiil\"&gt;Cyrodiil&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Hammerfell\"&gt;Hammerfell&lt;/a&gt;. Summerset became independent shortly after the Oblivion Crisis, with the Thalmor taking credit for ending the crisis. Shortly after, the Thalmor and their sympathizers in Valenwood organized a coup to remove the Imperial rule. However, since not all of Valenwood agreed to Thalmor rule, rebellions occurred. These were funded by the &lt;a href=\"Penitus%20Oculatus\"&gt;Penitus Oculatus&lt;/a&gt;, however, despite the efforts of the Penitus Oculatus, most of these rebellions were taken down harshly. Following the consolidation of Valenwood and the &lt;a href=\"Summerset%20Isles\"&gt;Summerset Isles&lt;/a&gt; into the &lt;a href=\"Third%20Aldmeri%20Dominion\"&gt;Third Aldmeri Dominion&lt;/a&gt;, the Dominion began a policy of expanding Aldmeri influence and power across Tamriel at the expense of the Third Empire of Cyrodiil. By claiming they had returned the Moons following the Void Nights, the Thalmor were seen as the saviors of the Khajiiti people, which resulted in adding the Khajiiti kingdoms of Anequina and Pelletine as client states to the Dominion. However, this expansion caught, even more, the attention of the Third Empire, which began a rivalry between the Dominion and the Empire that would ultimately lead up to the Great War, a devastating war fought between the Dominion and Empire. After 70 years of shutting communications with the Empire, it reestablished diplomatic relations with it.\nFollowing the Great War, the Aldmeri Dominion experienced increased prestige and power that the Mer had not possessed since the &lt;a href=\"Second%20Aldmeri%20Dominion\"&gt;Second Aldmeri Dominion&lt;/a&gt;, which had been defeated by &lt;a href=\"Tiber%20Septim\"&gt;Tiber Septim&lt;/a&gt; in the final years of the Second Era. Confident of its ability to dictate the Empire, the Dominion further expanded its influence into the other provinces of &lt;a href=\"Tamriel\"&gt;Tamriel&lt;/a&gt;. Rumors now hold that the Aldmeri Dominion is \"cleansing\" Valenwood, this has led to Bosmer such as Malborn, a Wood Elf in Skyrim whose family was murdered in such an event, to begin to work against them.\nOreyn Bearclaw.\n&lt;a href=\"Oreyn%20Bearclaw\"&gt;Oreyn Bearclaw&lt;/a&gt; was one of Valenwood's most legendary heroes. He was the son of king &lt;a href=\"Faume%20Toad-Eye\"&gt;Faume Toad-Eye&lt;/a&gt;, and was a respected clan hunter, as well as a future leader. Legend claims that he single-handedly defeated the &lt;a href=\"Glenhwyfaunva\"&gt;Glenhwyfaunva&lt;/a&gt;, the witch-serpent of &lt;a href=\"Elderwood\"&gt;Elderwood&lt;/a&gt;, forever bringing peace to his clan. He would accomplish numerous other deeds, before eventually losing his life to the &lt;a href=\"Knahaten%20Flu\"&gt;Knahaten Flu&lt;/a&gt;.\nReligion.\nThe major deity that the &lt;a href=\"Bosmer\"&gt;Bosmer&lt;/a&gt; worship is &lt;a href=\"Y%27ffre\"&gt;Y'ffre&lt;/a&gt;. The &lt;a href=\"Bosmeri%20pantheon\"&gt;Bosmeri pantheon&lt;/a&gt; is listed by this same book as follows: &lt;a href=\"Auri-El\"&gt;Auri-El&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Y%27ffre\"&gt;Y'ffre&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Arkay\"&gt;Arkay&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Z%27en\"&gt;Z'en&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Xarxes\"&gt;Xarxes&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Baan%20Dar\"&gt;Baan Dar&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Mara\"&gt;Mara&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Stendarr\"&gt;Stendarr&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Lorkhan\"&gt;Lorkhan&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Herma-Mora\"&gt;Herma-Mora&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Jone\"&gt;Jone&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Jode\"&gt;Jode&lt;/a&gt;. The Bosmer also worship a god called &lt;a href=\"Ius\"&gt;Ius&lt;/a&gt;.\nY'ffre.\n&lt;a href=\"Y%27ffre\"&gt;Y'ffre&lt;/a&gt; (God of the Forest and Song, known as &lt;a href=\"Jephre\"&gt;Jephre&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;a href=\"Aldmeri%20Pantheon\"&gt;Aldmeri Pantheon&lt;/a&gt;): Most important deity of the Bosmeri pantheon. While &lt;a href=\"Auri-El\"&gt;Auri-El&lt;/a&gt; Time Dragon might be the king of the gods, the Bosmer revere Y'ffre as the spirit of \"the now.\" According to the Wood Elves, after the creation of the mortal plane everything was in chaos. The first mortals were turning into plants and animals and back again. Then Y'ffre transformed himself into the first of the &lt;a href=\"Ehlnofey\"&gt;Ehlnofey&lt;/a&gt;, or \"Earth Bones.\" After these laws of nature were established, mortals had a semblance of safety in the new world, because they could finally understand it. Y'ffre is sometimes called the Storyteller, for the lessons he taught the first Bosmer. Some Bosmer still possess the knowledge of the chaos times, which they can use to great effect (the &lt;a href=\"Wild%20Hunt\"&gt;Wild Hunt&lt;/a&gt;).\nAuri-El.\n&lt;a href=\"Auri-El\"&gt;Auri-El&lt;/a&gt; (King of the &lt;a href=\"Aldmer\"&gt;Aldmer&lt;/a&gt;): The Elven Akatosh is Auri-El. Auri-El is the soul of &lt;a href=\"Anui-El\"&gt;Anui-El&lt;/a&gt;, who, in turn, is the soul of &lt;a href=\"Anu\"&gt;Anu&lt;/a&gt; the Everything. He is the chief of most Aldmeri pantheons. Most &lt;a href=\"Altmer\"&gt;Altmer&lt;/a&gt;i and Bosmeri claim direct descent from Auri-El. In his only known moment of weakness, he agreed to take his part in the creation of the mortal plane, that act which forever sundered the Elves from the spirit worlds of eternity. To make up for it, Auri-El led the original Aldmer against the armies of &lt;a href=\"Lorkhan\"&gt;Lorkhan&lt;/a&gt; in mythic times, vanquishing that tyrant and establishing the first kingdoms of the Altmer, &lt;a href=\"Atmora\"&gt;Atmora&lt;/a&gt; Old &lt;a href=\"Ehlnofey\"&gt;Ehlnofey&lt;/a&gt;. He then ascended to heaven in full observance of his followers so that they might learn the steps needed to escape the mortal plane.\nZ'en.\n&lt;a href=\"Z%27en\"&gt;Z'en&lt;/a&gt; (God of Toil): Bosmeri god of payment in kind. Studies indicate origins in both &lt;a href=\"Argonian\"&gt;Argonian&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Akaviri\"&gt;Akaviri&lt;/a&gt; mythologies, perhaps introduced into Valenwood by &lt;a href=\"Kothringi\"&gt;Kothringi&lt;/a&gt; sailors. Ostensibly an agriculture deity, Z'en sometimes proves to be an entity of a much higher cosmic order. His worship died out shortly after the &lt;a href=\"Knahaten%20Flu\"&gt;Knahaten Flu&lt;/a&gt;. He is linked to the &lt;a href=\"Aedra\"&gt;Aedra&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Zenithar\"&gt;Zenithar&lt;/a&gt;.\n&lt;a href=\"Wilderking\"&gt;Wilderking&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe Wilderking, also known as the Wilderqueen, is a god worshipped in Valenwood, though more commonly in &lt;a href=\"Greenshade\"&gt;Greenshade&lt;/a&gt;. It is the conjunction of a powerful &lt;a href=\"Mer\"&gt;Mer&lt;/a&gt; and the spirit of the Valenwood, with \"the Green\" mantling the mortal, making them the new Wilderking/queen. The Wilderking's domain is known as the &lt;a href=\"Wilderking%20Court\"&gt;Wilderking Court&lt;/a&gt;, with his physical form residing at the throne of the Wilderking above the city of &lt;a href=\"Greenheart\"&gt;Greenheart&lt;/a&gt;. \n&lt;a href=\"Ius\"&gt;Ius&lt;/a&gt;.\nIus is a god depicted in statues throughout Valenwood, &lt;a href=\"Hammerfell\"&gt;Hammerfell&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Elsweyr\"&gt;Elsweyr&lt;/a&gt;, depicting a misshapen humanoid carrying a rod.\nRegions.\n&lt;a href=\"Grahtwood\"&gt;Grahtwood&lt;/a&gt;.\nGrahtwood is the southeastern portion of Valenwood. It is home to the most &lt;a href=\"Graht-oak\"&gt;Graht-oak&lt;/a&gt;s of any other region, and has a dense humid jungle climate.\n&lt;a href=\"Greenshade\"&gt;Greenshade&lt;/a&gt;.\nGreenshade is the southwestern portion of Valenwood. It is filled with green plains and luscious rivers.\n&lt;a href=\"Malabal%20Tor\"&gt;Malabal Tor&lt;/a&gt;.\nMalabal Tor is the northwestern portion of Valenwood. It borders the &lt;a href=\"Gold%20Coast\"&gt;Gold Coast&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"Cyrodiil\"&gt;Cyrodiil&lt;/a&gt;, having the border run along the &lt;a href=\"Strid%20River\"&gt;Strid River&lt;/a&gt;. The region is filled with tall trees, having much of the forest floor shrouded in shade.\nFalinesti.\nThe walking city of the Bosmer king, Falinesti is south in the summer and north come \"Hearth Fire\". It is the largest of Valenwood \"graht-oaks\", whose magic was invoked at the dawn of recorded history. The Camoran throne is somewhere in the highest branches, as are numerous other natural dwellings. Wood Elves climb about its surface like termites, or carefully swing from level to level by means of thorny vines. Humans have generally been too unsettled by the city to stay there long, though Great Apes (&lt;a href=\"Imga\"&gt;Imga&lt;/a&gt;) and &lt;a href=\"Orsimer\"&gt;Orcs&lt;/a&gt; are common.\n&lt;a href=\"Eric%20of%20Guis\"&gt;Eric of Guis&lt;/a&gt; stayed in this capital city during its summer migration, and had this to say about it: \"No less abhorrent are the Bosmer than their kin at Summerset, but they are far more cooperative. The Wood Elves love the current human activity because it makes them feel important.\"\n&lt;a href=\"Reaper%27s%20March\"&gt;Reaper's March&lt;/a&gt;.\nReaper's March is the northeastern portion of Valenwood, shared in conjunction with Elsweyr. It was once known as \"Northern Valenwood,\" but following the fall of the &lt;a href=\"Reman%20Empire\"&gt;Reman Empire&lt;/a&gt;, the region received so much bloody warfare many the inhabitants even began to call it by said name. It is a dry Savannah-like area, covered in rocky terrain and dry plains."}

The first is Valenwood itself. Wild, untamed, and, some say, quite aware, there are entire regions of this wood which remain unexplored and house the most astonishing creatures. Only the most proficient trackers can hunt their prey in this strange forest without getting utterly lost.\nThe second reason is that many of these hunters are &lt;a href=\"Bosmer%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Wood Elves&lt;/a&gt;, born stalkers of prey, with a gifted sense for tracking.\nBut the biggest reason for the lofty reputation of the Valenwood Hounds is the hunter called &lt;a href=\"Haras\"&gt;Haras&lt;/a&gt;. A legend in his own right, some dispute that he even exists, but there's not a Hound that hasn't heard tell of his exploits.\nSaid to be unmatched in his devotion to Hircine and his skill at tracking, Haras was last heard from over a hundred years ago, when he set out to hunt the fabled Pale &lt;a href=\"Senche-Tiger%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Senche-Tiger&lt;/a&gt;. Others, hunting in Valenwood, have claimed to have seen him from time to time, still hunting that elusive beast. Although if these claims were true, Haras would have to have lived long beyond the normal life span of an &lt;a href=\"Elf\"&gt;Elf&lt;/a&gt;.\nStill, every one of the Hounds of Valenwood can trace his training to Haras and aspires to best him in fame and skill. That alone makes the Valenwood Hounds the greatest hunters in &lt;a href=\"Tamriel\"&gt;Tamriel&lt;/a&gt;."}

They have a daughter named &lt;a href=\"Serana\"&gt;Serana&lt;/a&gt;, whom Valerica kept hidden in a tomb for centuries to protect her from her father. Lord Harkon plots to end the &lt;a href=\"Tyranny%20of%20the%20Sun\"&gt;Tyranny of the Sun&lt;/a&gt;, but to do so he requires &lt;a href=\"Auriel%27s%20Bow%20%28Dawnguard%29\"&gt;Auriel's Bow&lt;/a&gt; and Serana's blood\u00a0for a ritual sacrifice.\nBackground.\nShe, along with Harkon and Serana, were once devout followers of &lt;a href=\"Molag%20Bal\"&gt;Molag Bal&lt;/a&gt;. Tradition of their cult dictated that the females be offered to Molag Bal on his summoning day. Being selected as an offering was considered to be an honor that was not rejected lightly. Few survived the ordeal, and those who did emerged as pure-blooded &lt;a href=\"Vampire%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;vampires&lt;/a&gt;. Such confluences were known as the \"&lt;a href=\"Daughters%20of%20Coldharbour\"&gt;Daughters of Coldharbour&lt;/a&gt;.\" As such, both Valerica and Serana underwent this horrific and degrading ritual.\nProphecy.\nSometime before the events of , Valerica fled her home of &lt;a href=\"Castle%20Volkihar\"&gt;Castle Volkihar&lt;/a&gt; with two &lt;a href=\"Elder%20Scroll%20%28Lore%29\"&gt;Elder Scrolls&lt;/a&gt; after Harkon became obsessed with the &lt;a href=\"Tyranny%20of%20the%20Sun\"&gt;Tyranny of the Sun&lt;/a&gt; prophecy. She believed that vampires should stay in the shadows, otherwise it would bring too much attention and ultimately lead to their extinction. She locked Serana and one &lt;a href=\"Elder%20Scroll%20%28Sun%29\"&gt;Elder Scroll&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Dimhollow%20Crypt\"&gt;Dimhollow Crypt&lt;/a&gt; for her protection and escaped to the &lt;a href=\"Soul%20Cairn%20%28Dawnguard%29\"&gt;Soul Cairn&lt;/a&gt; with &lt;a href=\"Elder%20Scroll%20%28Blood%29\"&gt;the other&lt;/a&gt;. Outraged by this betrayal, Lord Harkon immediately ordered everyone within his court to find her, but they unfortunately failed, and centuries later, he eventually gave up looking for her. He did, however, say that if she returns on her own, or if someone within his court finds her, she will have to answer for her actions.\nIdeal Masters.\nWhen she entered the Soul Cairn, she intended to strike a bargain with the rulers of the realm, the &lt;a href=\"Ideal%20Masters\"&gt;Ideal Masters&lt;/a&gt;. She requested refuge, and in return, Valerica would provide them with the souls that they craved. The Ideal Masters had other plans, as they valued Valerica's soul much more. They sent their &lt;a href=\"Keeper\"&gt;Keeper&lt;/a&gt;s to kill her, but she was able to retreat into a fortress and keep them at bay. This, however, turned into a stalemate as neither side had the upper hand. The Ideal Masters constructed a barrier around the fortress that could not be breached in order to contain Valerica and decided to wait. As the passage of time has little meaning in the Soul Cairn, the waiting game continued for thousands of years.\nInteractions.\n&lt;a href=\"Beyond%20Death\"&gt;Beyond Death&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe Dragonborn may travel with Serana to the\u00a0&lt;a href=\"Soul%20Cairn%20%28Dawnguard%29\"&gt;Soul Cairn&lt;/a&gt; to confront Valerica and obtain an Elder Scroll. She explains that the Elder Scrolls are merely a means to an end, and that Serana is the key to the Tyranny of the Sun prophecy. It's revealed that Serana's scroll tells of Auriel's Bow, and the scroll in Valerica's possession declares that \"The Blood of Coldharbor's Daughter will blind the eye of the Dragon.\"\nShe offers her scroll to the Dragonborn if they defeat the three &lt;a href=\"Keeper\"&gt;Keeper&lt;/a&gt;s maintain the barrier. She also warns that a fearsome Dragon named &lt;a href=\"Durnehviir\"&gt;Durnehviir&lt;/a&gt; is roaming this plane and is charged with overseeing the Keepers.\nOnce Durnehviir is slain she will remark about how she thought she would never see the death of that dragon, but realizes that his physical form is just displaced.\nThough Serana spent a lot of time with her mother before her exile, Serana comes to realize, in the Soul Cairn, that Valerica is as bad as her husband in the sense that she uses her daughter to further her plans.\n&lt;a href=\"Kindred%20Judgment\"&gt;Kindred Judgment&lt;/a&gt;.\nAfter the Dragonborn kills Harkon, it is possible to travel back to the Soul Cairn and tell her Harkon is dead. She will return to her study about a day later. After Valerica returns to the castle, she will plant new herbs in the garden in the courtyard, provided &lt;a href=\"Garan%20Marethi\"&gt;Garan Marethi&lt;/a&gt; is asked to repair the corridor that leads there. The Corridor cannot be repaired if the Dragonborn sides with the &lt;a href=\"Dawnguard%20%28Faction%29\"&gt;Dawnguard&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe Dragonborn can ask her to make &lt;a href=\"Bloodcursed%20Elven%20Arrow\"&gt;Bloodcursed Elven Arrow&lt;/a&gt;s, but she replies that even though Harkon is dead, she wants to stay as far away as possible from completing the prophecy that Harkon envisioned.\nConversations.\nSerana: \"Mother? Mother!\"\nValerica: \"Maker... it can't be. Serana?\"\nSerana: \"Is it really you? I can't believe it! How do we get inside? We have to talk.\"\nValerica: \"Serana? What are you doing here? Where's your father?\"\nSerana: \"He doesn't know we're here. I don't have time to explain.\"\nValerica: \"I must have failed. Harkon's found a way to decipher the prophecy, hasn't he.\"\nSerana: \"No, you've got it all wrong. We're here to complete the prophecy our way, not his.\"\nValerica: \"Wait a moment... you've brought a stranger here? Have you lost your mind?\"\nSerana: \"No, you don't...\"\nValerica: \"\"You. Come forward. I would speak with you.\"\n[After talking with Valerica]\nValerica: \"This stranger may call\" \"vampire, but\" \"knows nothing of our struggle. Why should I entrust you to\" \"?\"\nSerana: \"\"This \"stranger\" has done more for me in the brief time I've known\" \"than you've done in centuries!\"\"\nValerica: \"How dare you! I gave up everything I cared about to protect you from that fanatic you call a father!\"\nSerana: \"Yes, he's a fanatic... he's changed. But he's still my father. Why can't you understand how that makes me feel?\"\nValerica: \"Oh, Serana. If you'd only open your eyes. The moment your father discovers your role in the prophecy, that he needs your blood, you'd be in terrible danger.\"\nSerana: \"So to protect me you decided to shut me away from everything I cared about? You never asked me if hiding me in that tomb was the best course of action, you just expected me to follow you blindly. Both of you were obsessed with your own paths. Your motivations might have been different, but in the end, I'm still just a pawn to you, too. I want us to be a family again. But I don't know if we can ever have that. Maybe we don't deserve that kind of happiness. Maybe it isn't for us. But we have to stop him. Before he goes too far. And to do that, we need the Elder Scroll.\"\nValerica: \"I'm sorry, Serana. I didn't know... I didn't see. I've allowed my hatred of your father to enstrange us for too long. Forgive me. If you want the Elder Scroll, it's yours.\"\nSerana: \"Wait... I hear something!\"\nValerica: \"It's Durnehviir... he's here! Defend yourselves!\""}

I was able to attune the portal vessel to the &lt;a href=\"Soul%20Cairn%20%28Dawnguard%29\"&gt;Soul Cairn&lt;/a&gt; properly by using a small sample of &lt;a href=\"Ingredients%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;ingredients&lt;/a&gt;.\nAlthough the portal opened only for a few seconds, I'm confident that with the proper formula, it can be sustained indefinitely.

I'm listing the components below without the proper amounts for my own protection. As a secondary precaution, I am combining my own blood into the formula which should prevent anyone from being able to duplicate it and following me into the Soul Cairn.\nThe formula consists of:\n&lt;a href=\"Finely%20Ground%20Bone%20Meal\"&gt;Finely Ground Bone Meal&lt;/a&gt;\n&lt;a href=\"Purified%20Void%20Salt\"&gt;Purified Void Salt&lt;/a&gt;\n&lt;a href=\"Soul%20gem%20shards\"&gt;Soul gem shards&lt;/a&gt;\nUsing the proper measurements, place above in the silver-lined portal vessel and add blood as a reactive agent.\nI will make my way into the Soul Cairn tomorrow after I gather my things and prepare for a potentially lengthy exile. More importantly, I must enact my plans with &lt;a href=\"Serana\"&gt;Serana&lt;/a&gt;, and get her to &lt;a href=\"Dimhollow%20Crypt\"&gt;Dimhollow Crypt&lt;/a&gt; as soon as possible."}

Valsirenn, who has also been investigating the monastery, offers to team up with the Vestige and look for the newcomers in the Monastery Undercroft together. Within the Undercroft, she reveals herself to be a member of the &lt;a href=\"Psijic%20Order%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Psijic Order&lt;/a&gt;. After later attending &lt;a href=\"Kinlady%20Avinisse\"&gt;Kinlady Avinisse&lt;/a&gt;'s meeting in her &lt;a href=\"Kinlady%20Avinisse%27s%20Mansion\"&gt;mansion&lt;/a&gt;, Valsirenn offers to meet the Vestige and &lt;a href=\"Razum-dar%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Razum-dar&lt;/a&gt; at the &lt;a href=\"Coral%20Forest\"&gt;Coral Forest&lt;/a&gt;, where Kinlady Avinisse and Aldarch Tilcalar are meeting.\nDialogue.\nThe Queen's Decree.\nUpon examining the &lt;a href=\"Abyssal%20Pearl\"&gt;Abyssal Pearl&lt;/a&gt; in the Aldarch's office, Valsirenn will enter the room and say to the Vestige, \"Unusual knick-knack for an Aldarch's office, wouldn't you agree?\" If she is spoken to, the following conversation will begin:\n\"I noticed you skulking around while I was engaged in some skulking of my own. I suppose we both came to the monastery with a similar purpose in mind.\"\nIn the Monastery Undercroft, Valsirenn will say, \"Something's wrong down here. I sense magic. Vile magic.\" Upon sighting the cages full of newcomers, she will comment, \"Cages? These people did nothing to deserve such treatment. There's someone alive over there. See if you can help her.\" Then, if she is spoken to, she will say, \"Something is amiss in Summerset, but I can't quite put my finger on the cause. No matter. I'm sure my investigation will turn up something. I just need to be patient.\"\nAfter speaking with one of the caged prisoners, Valsirenn will remark, \"Is that a ... Skaafin?\" and run over to it. Speaking to her results in the following conversation:\n\"A Daedra? Here? And that's a Skaafin, if I remember my Daedric recitations correctly. Very curious.\"\nAfter continuing to the Undercroft Great Hall and seeing the &lt;a href=\"Earl%20of%20Clavicus%20Vile\"&gt;Earl of Clavicus Vile&lt;/a&gt;, Valsirenn will say in surprise, \"Daedric cultists? The pearl's draining these people!\" After running down to attack the cultists, she will say, \"I'll deal with the pearl, you hold off these creatures!\" and then \"The pearl's magic attracts these creatures. Hold them off while I complete my spell!\" After the enemies are killed, Valsirenn will say, \"Come on, let's talk outside.\"\nWhen spoken to in the Undercroft Labyrinth, Valsirenn will have the following dialogue:\n\"Those poor people. This wasn't just about newcomers and opposing the Queen's decree. That was Daedric magic back there! I just wish we had arrived a few moments earlier.\"\nAfter escaping the Undercroft Labyrinth, Valsirenn will say, \"Living on Artaeum for a few centuries doesn't prepare you for physical activity. Let the Eye of the Queen know what we discovered and I'll catch up with you later.\" If spoken to directly, she will have the following dialogue:\n\"We were warned that Daedric Princes had their eyes on Summerset, but I didn't expect that level of danger from what was supposed to be a simple investigation. I suggest you tell the Eye of the Queen what we discovered. I'll catch up with you later.\"\nAfter telling Razum-dar what was discovered by speaking with &lt;a href=\"Kinlady%20Avinisse\"&gt;Kinlady Avinisse&lt;/a&gt;, Valsirenn will appear and begin speaking to Razum-dar:\nValsirenn: \"I'm glad I found you. While watching the Kinlady's mansion, I saw her ladyship sneak out the back and leave the city.\"\nRazum-dar: \"The Kinlady is meeting the Aldarch in the Coral Forest. Raz smells something and it isn't moon-sugar biscuits!\"\nValsirenn: \"Your reputation precedes you, Eye of the Queen. I am Valsirenn of the Psijic Order. And I agree that the Aldarch is more than a simple monk.\"\nRazum-dar: \"We should work together, yes? But let's travel separately to avoid attracting unwanted attention. Raz will find you both at the Coral Forest.\"\nWhen initially speaking to her in the Coral Forest:\n\"One of Summerset's more unique environments, the Coral Forest. I used to love coming here when I was growing up. We need to find out why the Aldarch asked Kinlady Avinisse to meet him out here.\"\n\"You take the lead. My combat spells are extremely limited. Just stay alert. We don't know what the Aldarch and the Kinlady are doing out here.\"\nAfter nearing Kinlady Avinisse and Aldarch Tilcalar, Valsirenn will say, \"The Aldarch! We'd better hurry!\" and then \"I'll go after the Kinlady! You deal with the Aldarch!\"\nAfter defeating the Aldarch:\n\"Razum-dar apprehended the Kinlady. They're at the west edge of the Coral Forest. What happened to Aldarch Tilcalar?

The location consists of two towers connected by a bridge at the top of the first tower, which leads across the river to the base of the second tower. Seven &lt;a href=\"Bandits%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;bandits&lt;/a&gt; and a &lt;a href=\"bandit%20chief\"&gt;bandit chief&lt;/a&gt; can be encountered here.\nInteractions.\nFirst visit.\nWhen passing on the road for the first time, a leveled bandit, such as a &lt;a href=\"Bandit%20Marauder\"&gt;Bandit Marauder&lt;/a&gt; or a &lt;a href=\"Bandit%20Highwayman\"&gt;Bandit Highwayman&lt;/a&gt;, will demand a toll of 200 . If the &lt;a href=\"Last%20Dragonborn\"&gt;Dragonborn&lt;/a&gt; passes a &lt;a href=\"Speech\"&gt;Speech&lt;/a&gt; check, the amount can be brought down to 50 . Interestingly, passing through on a &lt;a href=\"Horse%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;horse&lt;/a&gt; allows one to avoid paying the toll altogether, since dialogue cannot be initiated while riding a mount. Paying the toll or using &lt;a href=\"Persuasion\"&gt;Persuasion&lt;/a&gt; to pass the toll renders all of the bandits non-hostile, allowing safe exploration of the towers without conflict, and a chance to stealth kill the bandit chief without alerting the rest. It will also mark the location as being cleared. After passing the toll, the Dragonborn may freely take any items within the towers.\nTreasure hunting.\nThe treasure chest from \"&lt;a href=\"Treasure%20Map%20II\"&gt;Treasure Map II&lt;/a&gt;\" is found near here. Before one can get the treasure, one must have the map. To find the chest, go to the towers and head east by the side of the river. Upon nearing the waterfall, there will be a small cut into the path with the chest inside it.\nTips and notes.\nA chest is rigged to drop a &lt;a href=\"Traps%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;spiked ball&lt;/a&gt; in the first tower. Open it, then jump to the left to avoid being hit, or unlock the trigger mechanism next to the chest to stop the mace from falling.\nOne must practice caution when on a horse; if the bandits become hostile, there is a high possibility that horse will attempt to climb the towers in order to fight the bandits. This may lead to the horse accidentally falling off and dying.\nThere are two &lt;a href=\"Corundum%20Ore\"&gt;corundum ore veins&lt;/a&gt; along the left of the path outside the second tower, one &lt;a href=\"Iron%20Ore%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;iron ore vein&lt;/a&gt; located just outside the second tower, and, with installed, two &lt;a href=\"clay\"&gt;clay&lt;/a&gt; deposits: one under the bridge on the opposite side of the river, and the second a little upstream on the same side. There is a random &lt;a href=\"leveled\"&gt;leveled&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Bows%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;bow&lt;/a&gt; in the lookout's post of the northern tower.\nThere is a lower grass section beside &lt;a href=\"Guldun%20Rock\"&gt;Guldun Rock&lt;/a&gt; that the Dragonborn can use to take out the lookout on the lower tower without danger of detection. The bandit can be killed stealthily by &lt;a href=\"Sneak%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;sneaking&lt;/a&gt; in the rocky edges on the left side of the lower grass section, while using a &lt;a href=\"Bows%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;bow&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"Crossbows%20%28Dawnguard%29\"&gt;crossbow&lt;/a&gt;, if is installed."}

The weather is often snowy and visibility is poor. The region is lightly forested with evergreen trees, and hardscrabble brown grass grows year-round. As the range slopes south, however, it becomes more mild and green grasses and deciduous trees can be found in the foothills leading to the &lt;a href=\"Nibenay%20Basin\"&gt;Nibenay Basin&lt;/a&gt;.\nLook for wide fields of scattered grey boulders. They are both indicative of the region's geology and excellent tactical cover.\nThe region's remoteness lends to its lawlessness, and &lt;a href=\"Camonna%20Tong%20Thug\"&gt;Camonna Tong Thug&lt;/a&gt;s can be found in high camps of the mountains. The region is also one of the few in Cyrodiil with neither an official &lt;a href=\"road\"&gt;road&lt;/a&gt; nor river.\nFauna and Flora.\nBy far the most abundant &lt;a href=\"plant\"&gt;plant&lt;/a&gt; in the mountains is the &lt;a href=\"Clouded%20Funnel%20Cap\"&gt;Clouded Funnel Cap&lt;/a&gt;. In lower, more temperate regions, plants such as &lt;a href=\"Milk%20Thistle\"&gt;Milk Thistle&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Monkshood\"&gt;Monkshood&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Motherwort%20Sprig\"&gt;Motherwort Sprig&lt;/a&gt; and the rare tree-based mushroom &lt;a href=\"Tinder%20Polypore%20Cap\"&gt;Tinder Polypore Cap&lt;/a&gt; grow.\nThese mountains are mainly home to &lt;a href=\"Deer%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;deer&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Wolf%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;wolves&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Bear%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;bears&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Mountain%20Lion%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;mountain lions&lt;/a&gt;.\nLocations.\nThe Valus Mountains had no serious urban development during the &lt;a href=\"Third%20Era\"&gt;Third Era&lt;/a&gt;.\nOther areas of interest.\nDespite the region's relatively small size, cold temperatures, and extreme elevations, it is a surprisingly lively section of the world. A tragic story of revenge as well as a charming view can be found at &lt;a href=\"Dive%20Rock\"&gt;Dive Rock&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href=\"Boethiah\"&gt;Boethiah&lt;/a&gt;, bestower of the powerful &lt;a href=\"Goldbrand\"&gt;Goldbrand&lt;/a&gt;, has a &lt;a href=\"Boethia%27s%20Shrine\"&gt;shrine&lt;/a&gt; high up in these mountains.\nThere is no clearly marked path to the shrine, and it can be difficult to reach. &lt;a href=\"Hero%20Hill\"&gt;Hero Hill&lt;/a&gt; lies in the foothills of the Valus, up a number of poorly maintained stairs from the head of the &lt;a href=\"Corbolo%20River\"&gt;Corbolo River&lt;/a&gt;. Finally, &lt;a href=\"Lord%20Rugdumph%27s%20Estate\"&gt;Lord Rugdumph's Estate&lt;/a&gt; lies in the far northwest of the range, square on the border with the &lt;a href=\"Jerall%20Mountains\"&gt;Jerall Mountains&lt;/a&gt;, as is the unmarked location, the &lt;a href=\"Dark%20Grove\"&gt;Dark Grove&lt;/a&gt;.\nThere are several small places of note that do not show up on the map. Look for an inactive &lt;a href=\"Wayshrines%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;Wayshrine&lt;/a&gt; with a treasure chest west of &lt;a href=\"Collapsed%20Mine\"&gt;Collapsed Mine&lt;/a&gt;. There is also a very remote clearing west and a bit north of &lt;a href=\"Hame\"&gt;Hame&lt;/a&gt; that shows evidence of &lt;a href=\"necromancy\"&gt;necromancy&lt;/a&gt;. A chest sits in the midst of a blackened group of trees, and large spiderwebs hang from the trees. Human skulls adorn wooden spikes next to the chest, and there is nothing else around."}

{"id": "796261", "revid": "17401442", "url": "https://elderscrolls.fandom.com/wiki?curid=796261", "title": "Vampire", "text": "Vampires, also spelled Vampyres, are those affected by the condition of &lt;a href=\"Vampirism\"&gt;Vampirism&lt;/a&gt; (Also known as Sanguinare Vampiris in Skyrim and Porphyric Hemophilia in Oblivion and Morrowind). They can feed on the blood of any warm-blooded creatures, but are infamous for targeting &lt;a href=\"mortal\"&gt;mortal&lt;/a&gt;s.\nThe types of vampire present in Tamriel are said to number over a hundred, with nine variations in the &lt;a href=\"Iliac%20Bay\"&gt;Iliac Bay&lt;/a&gt; alone, each with its own powers and abilities. Possessing various strengths relative to their age, and typically associated with &lt;a href=\"Undead\"&gt;undeath&lt;/a&gt;, vampires are related by legend to the &lt;a href=\"Daedric%20Prince\"&gt;Daedric Prince&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Molag%20Bal\"&gt;Molag Bal&lt;/a&gt;, who is referred to as the \"Kin-father\" of vampires. As the legend states, Bal is the father of the first vampire, which leads to all of vampirekind being considered his offspring.\nConsidered to be a \"blight of the world,\" Vampires are recognized as the strongest type of undead found in Tamriel, and are plagued by uncontrollable thirst for blood. That causes a vampire's first kill to commonly be a friend or otherwise acquaintance of their mortal selves. Along with &lt;a href=\"lich\"&gt;lich&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"wraith\"&gt;wraith&lt;/a&gt;s, vampires are among the few undead types that are recognized as sentient (as opposed to being bound by a &lt;a href=\"necromancer\"&gt;necromancer&lt;/a&gt;'s will) and capable of understandable speech.\nVampires are often recognizable by the exceptional paleness of their skin and alert eyes, as well as visible signs of restlessness. They are also weak to the light of the sun, as exposure burns their skin and makes the recovery of wounds impossible. Another debilitating condition is hunger, which also prevents healing, and causes the infamous, signature lust for blood that affects all vampires.\nOne strain of vampirism especially prevalent during the &lt;a href=\"Second%20Era\"&gt;Second Era&lt;/a&gt;\u2014&lt;a href=\"Noxiphilic%20Sanguivoria%20%28Disease%29\"&gt;Noxiphilic Sanguivoria&lt;/a&gt;\u2014however, is known to give special abilities during the night to those whom it afflicts, such as resistance to pain and courage. Those infected with this particular strain are not burned or otherwise negatively affected by sunlight.\nBehavior and distribution.\nVampires behave differently according to the individual, but certain habits are shared by most. One of the most widespread of such habits is the tendency to sleep during the day, that comes with their nocturnal habits. Feeding behavior varies, and vampires claim victims in their own way, whether by attacking conscious people, silently feeding during their sleep. or using a spell to make them their &lt;a href=\"Vampire%27s%20Thrall\"&gt;Vampire's Thrall&lt;/a&gt;.\nSkyrim.\nThe most powerful vampire tribe of eastern &lt;a href=\"Skyrim\"&gt;Skyrim&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"Volkihar%20Clan\"&gt;Volkihar&lt;/a&gt;, are known as paranoid and cruel, never venturing out of the ice-coated lakes of which they live under except to feed, which they tend to do whilst the target sleeps. Other remarkable groups within the province include Movarth's Coven, led by the ex-vampire hunter and ancient vampire &lt;a href=\"Movarth%20Piquine\"&gt;Movarth Piquine&lt;/a&gt;. They inhabit &lt;a href=\"Movarth%27s%20Lair\"&gt;Movarth's Lair&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Hjaalmarch\"&gt;Hjaalmarch&lt;/a&gt;, and plan to take over the city of &lt;a href=\"Morthal\"&gt;Morthal&lt;/a&gt; by having the local &lt;a href=\"Nord\"&gt;Nord&lt;/a&gt; vampire &lt;a href=\"Alva\"&gt;Alva&lt;/a&gt; seduce the guards and turn them one by one into vampires; then wrangling up the townsfolk and exploiting them as &lt;a href=\"Vampire%20Cattle%20%28Dawnguard%29\"&gt;cattle&lt;/a&gt;. The plan is stopped in the &lt;a href=\"4E%20201\"&gt;3rd Century&lt;/a&gt; of the &lt;a href=\"Fourth%20Era\"&gt;Fourth Era&lt;/a&gt;, when the &lt;a href=\"Last%20Dragonborn\"&gt;Last Dragonborn&lt;/a&gt; destroys the coven. In &lt;a href=\"Falkreath%20Hold\"&gt;Falkreath Hold&lt;/a&gt;, the Nord vampire &lt;a href=\"Vighar\"&gt;Vighar&lt;/a&gt; (an ancestor of &lt;a href=\"Jarl\"&gt;Jarl&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Dengeir%20of%20Stuhn\"&gt;Dengeir&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"Falkreath\"&gt;Falkreath&lt;/a&gt;), leads a coven in &lt;a href=\"Bloodlet%20Throne\"&gt;Bloodlet Throne&lt;/a&gt; that is destroyed upon his descendant's request; and the couple of vampires &lt;a href=\"Hern\"&gt;Hern&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Hert\"&gt;Hert&lt;/a&gt; run &lt;a href=\"Half-Moon%20Mill\"&gt;Half-Moon Mill&lt;/a&gt;, where they use local animals and travelers as food source. The &lt;a href=\"Dark%20Brotherhood%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Dark Brotherhood&lt;/a&gt; is given a contract to kill the male, Hern, but the fate of the female, Hert, depends on the player.\nCyrodiil.\nA single group exists in &lt;a href=\"Cyrodiil\"&gt;Cyrodiil&lt;/a&gt;, a &lt;a href=\"Cyrodiil%20Vampyrum%20Order\"&gt;powerful clan&lt;/a&gt; of vampires which ousted all competition, and are remarked as much more civilized and organized than most tribes; they are able to pass themselves off as mortal, so long as they remain well-fed (and thus, very hard to find). Much like the Volkihar of Skyrim, they feed during their victims' sleep and consider discretion to be the greatest of their virtues. They focus most of their time on the pursuit of influence, political and otherwise, and are skillful in their manipulation of Cyrodilic society.\nValenwood.\nIn northern &lt;a href=\"Valenwood\"&gt;Valenwood&lt;/a&gt;, four tribes are known, the &lt;a href=\"Telboth\"&gt;Telboth&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Yekef\"&gt;Yekef&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Keerilth\"&gt;Keerilth&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Bonsamu\"&gt;Bonsamu&lt;/a&gt;. The Telboth first prey upon children, eventually taking their place in the family and waiting for years before claiming all of them as victims; while the Yekef are said to swallow &lt;a href=\"men\"&gt;men&lt;/a&gt; whole. The Keerilth have a signature ability of temporarily disintegrating into mist (whether on land or underwater); and &lt;a href=\"Bonsamu\"&gt;Bonsamu&lt;/a&gt; are said to be indistinguishable from ordinary &lt;a href=\"Bosmer\"&gt;Bosmer&lt;/a&gt; except when seen by candlelight.\nMorrowind.\nIn &lt;a href=\"Morrowind\"&gt;Morrowind&lt;/a&gt;, which has a violent antipathy for &lt;a href=\"necromancy\"&gt;necromancy&lt;/a&gt; and vampires as part of local culture, they were believed to be extinct for centuries. There are three known bloodlines in the island of &lt;a href=\"Vvardenfell\"&gt;Vvardenfell&lt;/a&gt;: the &lt;a href=\"Clan%20Quarra\"&gt;Quarra&lt;/a&gt;, dubbed the most savage of vampire bloodlines, who are known for their exceptional strength and endurance, and attack in a state of ecstatic frenzy; the &lt;a href=\"Clan%20Aundae\"&gt;Aundae&lt;/a&gt;, who are potent &lt;a href=\"Spells\"&gt;spellcasters&lt;/a&gt; and seek to &lt;a href=\"Illusion\"&gt;hypnotize&lt;/a&gt; victims before feeding; and the swift and agile &lt;a href=\"Clan%20Berne\"&gt;Clan Berne&lt;/a&gt; who prefer &lt;a href=\"stealth\"&gt;stealth&lt;/a&gt; and ambush, first poisoning the victim with a bite, then withdrawing to a safe distance and returning to feed only when the prey is weakened. It is also noted that the \"&lt;a href=\"Ash%20Vampire\"&gt;Ash Vampire&lt;/a&gt;\" of &lt;a href=\"Ashlander\"&gt;Ashlander&lt;/a&gt; legend is not undead, and has never been linked to any of the known clans of Tamrielic vampires. It is unknown whether the vampires begun to sneak back into the province or if long-dormant ones have been awakened, but by &lt;a href=\"3E%20427\"&gt;3E 427&lt;/a&gt;, they had already made a significant return.\nIliac Bay.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Montalion\"&gt;Montalion&lt;/a&gt; of the mouth of the &lt;a href=\"Bjoulsae%20River\"&gt;Bjoulsae River&lt;/a&gt; contact new \"family members\" by letter, and alone have the power of inherent teleportation and curing of &lt;a href=\"paralysis\"&gt;paralysis&lt;/a&gt;; they dominate the regions of &lt;a href=\"Wayrest\"&gt;Wayrest&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Bhoriane\"&gt;Bhoriane&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Gavaudon\"&gt;Gavaudon&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Satakalaam\"&gt;Satakalaam&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Lainlyn\"&gt;Lainlyn&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Mournoth\"&gt;Mournoth&lt;/a&gt;. Their mentors are known to be very patient with new vampires.\nHigh Rock.\nIn &lt;a href=\"High%20Rock\"&gt;High Rock&lt;/a&gt;, a group called the &lt;a href=\"Glenmoril%20Coven\"&gt;Glenmoril Wyrd&lt;/a&gt; inhabits &lt;a href=\"Breton\"&gt;Breton&lt;/a&gt; cities; and the &lt;a href=\"Vraseth%20Clan\"&gt;Vraseth Clan&lt;/a&gt;, who are gifted with &lt;a href=\"Nimbleness%20%28Daggerfall%29\"&gt;nimbleness&lt;/a&gt;, dominate the regions of &lt;a href=\"Daggerfall\"&gt;Daggerfall&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Betony\"&gt;Betony&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Glenpoint\"&gt;Glenpoint&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Kambria\"&gt;Kambria&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Tulune\"&gt;Tulune&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Glenumbra\"&gt;Glenumbra&lt;/a&gt;.

Both the Glenmoril Wyrd and the Whet-Fang are recognized as possible rivals by the Cyrodilic vampires.\nOther.\nVampire groups exist in &lt;a href=\"Elsweyr\"&gt;Elsweyr&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Summerset%20Isles\"&gt;Summerset Isles&lt;/a&gt;, but not much is known about them.\nThe bloodline of &lt;a href=\"Lamae%20Beolfag\"&gt;Lamae Beolfag&lt;/a&gt; is afflicted by the disease &lt;a href=\"Noxiphilic%20Sanguivoria%20%28Disease%29\"&gt;Noxiphilic Sanguivoria&lt;/a&gt; (rather than the more common &lt;a href=\"Porphyric%20Hemophilia\"&gt;Porphyric Hemophilia&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Sanguinare%20Vampiris\"&gt;Sanguinare Vampiris&lt;/a&gt;). As a consequence, the vampires of this group neither burn nor weaken in the sunlight, but rather become more powerful once night falls. Their abilities include invisibility. A particular way of acquiring this strand of vampirism is through the \"Rite of Scion\", in which a mortal's blood is fully replaced by that of Lamae herself. This rite turns one afflicted by vampirism into a &lt;a href=\"Scion\"&gt;Scion&lt;/a&gt;, a stronger variety of vampire. These vampires don't worship Molag Bal, but rather hate him in accordance with Lamae's will. Having new recruits profane symbols of Bal is part of the ritual. The exact name of this bloodline is unknown but they were extremely common in the &lt;a href=\"Second%20Era\"&gt;Second Era&lt;/a&gt;, and were not limited to any particular area of Tamriel.\nOrigins.\nMost vampires trace their lineage to a distant common ancestor, an unwilling &lt;a href=\"Nedic\"&gt;Nedic&lt;/a&gt; virgin called Lamae Beolfag (commonly referred to as Bloodmatron Lamae, Lamae Bal and Blood-matron), who was defiled by Molag Bal. With her, he spawned the race of monsters known as vampires, who then set upon nomads, spreading his corruption further. Other species of vampires are said to be the result of other pacts and bargains with Molag Bal, who promises immortality and power, but gives the afflicted \"an eternity of damnation.\"\nThe Tribunal Temple's doctrine teaches a different version of the origin of vampires, but still sees Bal as their progenitor. In the legend, Molag Bal (called the \"Father of Monsters\") spawned the first vampire upon the corpse of a defeated foe, whose nature varies by account. In some versions, the foe is a &lt;a href=\"Daedra\"&gt;Daedra&lt;/a&gt; Lord, in others a Temple &lt;a href=\"Saint\"&gt;Saint&lt;/a&gt; or a powerful beast. It is noted that such legend only appears in Morrowind's &lt;a href=\"lore\"&gt;lore&lt;/a&gt;.\nVampirism.\nFor Vampirism in specific games:"}

These clans are named after their respective progenitor.\nUnnamed vampires belong to one of the three bloodlines and transmit that specific variant of vampirism, but they are not part of the actual clans.\nEffects.\nVampires receive a multitude of bonuses to various attributes and &lt;a href=\"Skills%20%28Morrowind%29\"&gt;skills&lt;/a&gt;, including: &lt;a href=\"Acrobatics%20%28Morrowind%29\"&gt;Acrobatics&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Athletics%20%28Morrowind%29\"&gt;Athletics&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Destruction%20%28Morrowind%29\"&gt;Destruction&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Hand-to-Hand%20%28Morrowind%29\"&gt;Hand-to-Hand&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Illusion%20%28Morrowind%29\"&gt;Illusion&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Mysticism%20%28Morrowind%29\"&gt;Mysticism&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Speed%20%28Morrowind%29\"&gt;Speed&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Strength%20%28Morrowind%29\"&gt;Strength&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Unarmored\"&gt;Unarmored&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Willpower%20%28Morrowind%29\"&gt;Willpower&lt;/a&gt;.

{"id": "2628", "revid": "31606937", "url": "https://elderscrolls.fandom.com/wiki?curid=2628", "title": "Vampire (Oblivion)", "text": "Vampires are spread out all across &lt;a href=\"Cyrodiil\"&gt;Cyrodiil&lt;/a&gt;. While individual vampires are known to be created through infection by the disease &lt;a href=\"Porphyric%20Hemophilia%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;Porphyric Hemophilia&lt;/a&gt;, the origin of the species as a whole is largely unknown. According to a tome in &lt;a href=\"The%20Vile%20Lair\"&gt;The Vile Lair&lt;/a&gt;, vampires are the indirect creation of the &lt;a href=\"Daedric%20Prince\"&gt;Daedric Prince&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Molag%20Bal\"&gt;Molag Bal&lt;/a&gt;.\nCharacteristics.\n&lt;a href=\"Vampirism%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;Vampirism&lt;/a&gt; is the result of Porphyric Hemophilia, which can infect humans, &lt;a href=\"Mer\"&gt;Mer&lt;/a&gt; and even &lt;a href=\"Beastfolk\"&gt;Beastfolk&lt;/a&gt;. Thus, vampires are not strictly a race themselves, but rather are vampiric forms of nearly all other sentient races. As a result of their transformation, a vampire's skin becomes pale or gray-tinted, their eyes turn red (or white in the case of Khajiit and Argonians), and their canines sharpen into fangs. Most vampires, however, can suppress this transformation through the consumption of blood, which allows them to coexist with the mortal races.\nVampires are physically superior to humans, having improved &lt;a href=\"Strength%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;strength&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Speed%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;speed&lt;/a&gt;, and inherent &lt;a href=\"Invisibility%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;invisibility&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Charm%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;charm&lt;/a&gt; powers. They are also immortal, and cannot be killed through starvation or old age. They are greatly affected by the former, however, which the &lt;a href=\"Hero%20of%20Kvatch\"&gt;Hero&lt;/a&gt; can see at a few points throughout Cyrodiil; decades of starvation will drive vampires mad, and they will go feral and attack on sight. Most notably to the Hero, all vampires can transmit Porphyric Hemophilia in &lt;a href=\"Combat%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;combat&lt;/a&gt;, which causes vampirism after three days if left uncured.\nThey also exhibit many of the weaknesses assigned to their kind in oral traditions; they are all weak to fire, and advanced vampirism leads to weakness to sunlight, hence many vampires choosing to live in dark areas such as caves. However, vampires in &lt;a href=\"Tamriel\"&gt;Tamriel&lt;/a&gt; aren't affected by &lt;a href=\"Garlic%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;garlic&lt;/a&gt; (with the exception of &lt;a href=\"Vicente%20Valtieri\"&gt;Vicente Valtieri&lt;/a&gt;, who was allergic to it even as a human).\nVariations.\nThe bulk of the vampires that are encountered across Cyrodiil are vampiric forms of some other character class. Vampires conform strictly to their class, as can be seen by their choices of &lt;a href=\"Weapons%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;weapons&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"magic\"&gt;magic&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Armor%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;armor&lt;/a&gt; in combat. This is particularly handy during the Daedric Quest \"&lt;a href=\"Hermaeus%20Mora%20%28Quest%29\"&gt;Hermaeus Mora&lt;/a&gt;\" which requires the player to soul trap all 10 races.\n&lt;a href=\"Vampire%20Matriarch\"&gt;Vampire Matriarch&lt;/a&gt;s and &lt;a href=\"Vampire%20Patriarch\"&gt;Vampire Patriarch&lt;/a&gt;s are powerful vampires. As their names imply, they are the \"mothers\" and \"fathers\" of a band of vampires, similar to a &lt;a href=\"Marauder%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;Marauder&lt;/a&gt;. Having a high position, they are very well equipped with the highest quality armor and weapons of their level. Use caution, as they defend themselves well, and attack viciously. Like all vampires, they have a &lt;a href=\"Weakness%20to%20Fire%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;weakness to fire&lt;/a&gt;.\nMatriarchs and Patriarchs can usually be found in &lt;a href=\"Caves%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;caves&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Ayleid%20Ruins%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;Ayleid Ruins&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Mines%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;mine&lt;/a&gt;, or &lt;a href=\"Forts%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;fort&lt;/a&gt; that contain nests of vampires, but not until the higher levels.

They are individuals afflicted with the disease \"&lt;a href=\"Sanguinare%20Vampiris\"&gt;Sanguinare Vampiris&lt;/a&gt;\". The disease causes drastic physical and biological changes that are permanent if not cured within three &lt;a href=\"day\"&gt;day&lt;/a&gt;s. Among these changes include a heightened &lt;a href=\"Weakness%20to%20Sunlight\"&gt;vulnerability to sunlight&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Weakness%20to%20Fire%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;fire&lt;/a&gt; and an increased &lt;a href=\"Resist%20Frost%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;resistance to frost&lt;/a&gt;. All benefits and inhibitions are sustained by the consumption of blood.\nOrigins.\nVampires can be traced back to the &lt;a href=\"Daedric%20Prince\"&gt;Daedric Prince&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Molag%20Bal\"&gt;Molag Bal&lt;/a&gt;, the Lord of Domination, who created the first vampire sometime around the &lt;a href=\"First%20Era\"&gt;First Era&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href=\"Lamae%20Beolfag\"&gt;Lamae Beolfag&lt;/a&gt; was a &lt;a href=\"Nedic\"&gt;Nedic&lt;/a&gt; virgin who was raped by Molag Bal. It is recorded that after the ordeal, Molag Bal shed a droplet of blood on her brow and left her to die. During the night she died, but as her funeral pyre was still burning she emerged as the first pure-blood vampire.\nPure blood.\nMolag Bal has since been known to confer Pure Vampirism to other individuals directly via a ritual that granted them &lt;a href=\"Vampire%20Lord\"&gt;great power&lt;/a&gt; over \"lesser\" vampires. One such case was &lt;a href=\"Lord%20Harkon\"&gt;Lord Harkon&lt;/a&gt;, who claims to have slaughtered a thousand innocents in order to gain this power, though this might be an exaggeration due to contradictory evidence.\nDaughters of Coldharbour.\nFemales seeking to gain the pure-blood vampirism are required to undergo a ritual with Molag Bal. Such confluences are called &lt;a href=\"Daughters%20of%20Coldharbour\"&gt;Daughters of Coldharbour&lt;/a&gt;. A tradition developed among Molag Bal worshiping cults which dictated that females be offered to him on his summoning day. Few survive the ordeal and those who do emerge as &lt;a href=\"Vampire%20Lord\"&gt;pure-blooded vampires&lt;/a&gt;. Being selected as an offering was considered to be an honor that is not rejected lightly.\nStigma.\nDue to their predatory nature, vampires are widely viewed as evil and violent creatures. &lt;a href=\"Citizen\"&gt;Citizen&lt;/a&gt;s and &lt;a href=\"Hold%20Guard\"&gt;Hold Guard&lt;/a&gt;s consider vampires open threats and attack anyone who reveals themselves to be a vampire (or if it can obviously be seen). In some cases, vampires are actively hunted down and destroyed by certain people, namely the &lt;a href=\"Vigilants%20of%20Stendarr\"&gt;Vigilants of Stendarr&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Dawnguard%20%28Faction%29\"&gt;Dawnguard&lt;/a&gt;.\nVolkihar Clan.\nThe vampires who inhabit the wilds of Skyrim are largely considered to stem from the powerful &lt;a href=\"Volkihar%20Clan%20%28Dawnguard%29\"&gt;Volkihar Clan&lt;/a&gt; that began with Harkon. These vampires are not considered to be of pure blood like Harkon and his family, as their vampirism was contracted from other lesser vampires. As such they are often looked down upon by members of Harkon's court.\nThey are said to live under haunted, frozen lakes and only leave their dens to feed, however more often than not they are encountered in remote &lt;a href=\"Caves%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;caves&lt;/a&gt; and ruins. It's unknown if any Volkihar Vampires possess the ability to reach through the ice of frozen lakes as described in books, or if it's just folklore.\nIn addition, the Volkihar share many of the same traits as their &lt;a href=\"Vampire%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;Cyrodilic counterparts&lt;/a&gt;. A few are known to be more cultured and civilized than the vampires of other provinces and as such can seamlessly blend into society. Many also prefer to feed on victims while they are asleep and unaware. One difference, however, is they do not burn in direct sunlight, rather they are just weakened by it.\nIn the &lt;a href=\"Official%20Plug-ins%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;plug-in&lt;/a&gt;, the Volkihar Clan becomes a joinable &lt;a href=\"Factions%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;faction&lt;/a&gt;.\nPhysical appearance.\nVampires can be of any &lt;a href=\"Races%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;race&lt;/a&gt; but the majority of them are easily distinguishable from uninfected persons. As a result of the hemophiliac virus, &lt;a href=\"Sanguinare%20Vampiris\"&gt;Sanguinare Vampiris&lt;/a&gt;, the infected slowly grow a pallid complexion. Fangs protrude from their gums, allowing for easier feeding and eye color changes from the spectrum of average hues to red. &lt;a href=\"Bosmer%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Bosmer&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Dunmer%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Dunmer&lt;/a&gt;, which typically already possess red eyes, may pass unnoticed as vampires.\nWhen infected, the fur of the Khajiit alters as the skin of a human or elf would. Long-toothed by nature, the incisors of the Khajiit grow exceptionally long, so that they protrude below the lip. However, their pupils become thinner and more blade-like. The scales of Argonians grow grayer as the infection worsens.\n\"Dawnguard\".\nWith the addition of , the facial features for some &lt;a href=\"human\"&gt;human&lt;/a&gt; vampires was slightly re-designed to be noticeably more twisted.\nThe most apparent is the eyes which have changed from red to a golden-orange hue. The cheeks are prominently narrowed and folds of skin that run from the nose to the corners of the mouth are also significantly deeper. The bridge of the nose features several ridges and is shortened, much like a bat. Prominent ridges also appear around the forehead and eyes, and a deep crimson line runs down from the bottom of the nose to the chin. The only exceptions to most of these drastic physical changes seem to be &lt;a href=\"Serana\"&gt;Serana&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Valerica\"&gt;Valerica&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Hert\"&gt;Hert&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Sybille%20Stentor\"&gt;Sybille Stentor&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Harkon\"&gt;Lord Harkon&lt;/a&gt;.\nTypes.\nVampires come in two variants: regular and master. The specific type that is encountered is typically level-dependent, however lower leveled vampires can still be encountered at higher levels. The race and gender is radiant.\nThe combat style of both types doesn't vary much. Both are primarily spellcasters and one-handed melee fighters and wear either assorted pieces of armor or standard &lt;a href=\"Mage%20Robes\"&gt;Mage Robes&lt;/a&gt;. They also have a unique version of &lt;a href=\"Vampiric%20Drain%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Vampiric Drain&lt;/a&gt; spell that is much more powerful than the version available to the &lt;a href=\"Last%20Dragonborn\"&gt;Dragonborn&lt;/a&gt;. At higher levels it can drain &lt;a href=\"Health%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;health&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Stamina%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;stamina&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Magicka%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;magicka&lt;/a&gt;. All vampires past level 6 also gain a bonus to &lt;a href=\"Fortify%20Unarmed\"&gt;Unarmed Damage&lt;/a&gt;.\nBoth types also exhibit the symptoms of stage two of &lt;a href=\"Vampirism%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Vampirism&lt;/a&gt;, namely:\n\"Dawnguard\".\n introduces two new sub-types of vampire. The &lt;a href=\"Nightlord%20Vampire\"&gt;Nightlord Vampire&lt;/a&gt;, the highest standard vampire type and the &lt;a href=\"Nightmaster%20Vampire\"&gt;Nightmaster Vampire&lt;/a&gt;, the highest boss level variety, replacing the &lt;a href=\"Volkihar%20Master%20Vampire\"&gt;Volkihar Master Vampire&lt;/a&gt;.\nIn addition, vampires now wear a selection of vampire specific clothing and armor, rather than generic mage robes. These include &lt;a href=\"Vampire%20Armor%20%28Armor%20Piece%29\"&gt;vampire armor&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Vampire%20Boots%20%28Clothing%29\"&gt;vampire boots&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"vampire%20robes\"&gt;vampire robes&lt;/a&gt;.\nStandard vampires.\nStandard vampires range from &lt;a href=\"Character%20Level\"&gt;level 1\u201348&lt;/a&gt;. With the addition of , the level 60 &lt;a href=\"Nightlord%20Vampire\"&gt;Nightlord Vampire&lt;/a&gt; is added.\nMaster Vampires.\nMaster Vampires are the highest possible level of vampires encountered and typically serve as the boss of a vampire lair.\nThe standard &lt;a href=\"Master%20Vampire\"&gt;Master Vampire&lt;/a&gt;s are level dependant and range from level 14\u201342, whereas the &lt;a href=\"Volkihar%20Master%20Vampire\"&gt;Volkihar Master Vampire&lt;/a&gt; is fixed at level 53 but can be encountered when the Dragonborn is level 39+. Once the Dragonborn reaches level 65 all the low level master vampire bosses of any dungeon will be replaced by the &lt;a href=\"Nightmaster%20Vampire\"&gt;Nightmaster Vampire&lt;/a&gt; .\nDialogue.\n\"You've come far, mortal. No doubt you seek to enter Potema's Sanctum. I can see to that. We'll need plenty of fresh corpses to rebuild her army, you see.\"\nConversations.\nVampire: \"And who is this?\"\nVighar: \"It is no matter, this fool will be the next act of the show.\"\nVampire: \"These Vigilants never know when to give up.

Perhaps another Vigilant will wander in soon.\"\nVampire 2: \"I wish Lokil would hurry it up. I have half a mind to return to the castle and tell Harkon what a fool he's entrusted this mission to.\"\nVampire: \"And I have half a mind to tell Lokil of your disloyalty.\"\nVampire 2: \"You wouldn't dare. Now shut up and keep on watch.\"\nAdalvald: \"I'll never tell you anything, vampire. My oath to Stendarr is stronger than any suffering you can inflict on me.\"\nLokil: \"I believe you, Vigilant. And I don't think you even know what you've found here. So go and meet your beloved Stendarr.\"\nVampire: \"Are you sure that was wise, Lokil? He still might have told us something. We haven't gotten anywhere ourselves with...\"\nLokil: \"He knew nothing. He served his purpose by leading us to this place. Now it is up to us to bring Harkon the prize. And we will not return without it. Vingalmo and Orthjolf will make way for me after this.\"\nVampire: \"Yes, of course Lokil. Do not forget who brought you news of the Vigilants' discovery.\"\nLokil: \"I never forget who my friends are. Or my enemies.\""}

He will refer the Hero to &lt;a href=\"Count\"&gt;Count&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Count%20Hassildor\"&gt;Hassildor&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"Skingrad%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;Skingrad&lt;/a&gt;.\nUpon arrival at &lt;a href=\"Castle%20Skingrad\"&gt;Castle Skingrad&lt;/a&gt;, find Janus Hassildor's &lt;a href=\"Steward\"&gt;steward&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Hal-Liurz\"&gt;Hal-Liurz&lt;/a&gt;, in order to contact Hassildor. Once Hassildor comes, he explains that he and his wife are vampires. He lives with the disease, but his wife, &lt;a href=\"Rona%20Hassildor\"&gt;Rona Hassildor&lt;/a&gt;, could not, slipping into a coma as a result. Hassildor wants the cure, and tells of a witch that lives near the Corbolo river, south of &lt;a href=\"Cheydinhal%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;Cheydinhal&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Drakelowe\"&gt;Drakelowe&lt;/a&gt;.\nTravel to Drakelowe and talk to the witch &lt;a href=\"Melisande\"&gt;Melisande&lt;/a&gt;. She will say that she requires five empty &lt;a href=\"Grand%20Soul%20Gem%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;grand soul gems&lt;/a&gt; before she will help with the cure. Once these are delivered, she asks for a number of ingredients to make the &lt;a href=\"Vampirism%20Cure%20Potion\"&gt;cure&lt;/a&gt;. Most can be purchased, however, it may become difficult to buy items when in the advanced stages of vampirism.\nBlood of an Argonian.\nTo get the blood, use the dagger provided by Melisande to stab any &lt;a href=\"Argonians%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;Argonian&lt;/a&gt; in the game. There are a number of ways to go about this:\nVampire Dust.\nThe Hero must kill the vampire Hindaril, found in &lt;a href=\"Redwater%20Slough\"&gt;Redwater Slough&lt;/a&gt; off of the &lt;a href=\"Panther%20River\"&gt;Panther River&lt;/a&gt;. Hindaril is behind a door with a very hard lock. The key is beyond an underwater passage and in a chest. Once he is found he may be attacked immediately, before he arms himself.\nConclusion.\nReturn to Melisande and talk to her. After a day, she will have a potion ready. She will give the Hero both a consumable version, and a miscellaneous item version for Rona; however, drinking the potion early may bug the quest. Return to Skingrad and talk to the steward again. She will lead the Hero to the Chamber of the Lost, where Melisande will attempt to cure Rona.\nAfter two days, the count will tell the Hero to return in another twenty four hours and talk to the steward. Doing so will reward them with a decent amount of gold\u20141,000 or higher, as the amount is leveled.\nThe cure potion may now be consumed safely.\nAlternative solution.\nWith the official &lt;a href=\"The%20Vile%20Lair\"&gt;Vile Lair&lt;/a&gt; add-on, after upgrading it, it is possible to cure vampirism at any time using the &lt;a href=\"Font%20of%20Renewal\"&gt;Font of Renewal&lt;/a&gt; in the Vile Cloister and the &lt;a href=\"Purgeblood%20Salts\"&gt;Purgeblood Salts&lt;/a&gt; found near it. This can be done as many times as desired. This does not finish the Vampire Cure questline, or remove it from the quest log; it simply cures the Hero's vampirism.\nThe player can also cure Vampirism by entering console command:\nOnce the player has entered the console command, the \"Vampirism Cure Potion\" potion should be added to their inventory. Once they drink it, all effects of vampirism are cured. However, sometimes glitches in the game can prevent the \"Vampirism Cure Potion\" potion to be added to the inventory. The player can enter the following console commands to get rid of the vampirism disease/curse:\nIt should be noted that if the player just enters \"set pcvampire to -1\" they will retain all \"perks\" of being a vampire."}

{"id": "132886", "revid": "17401442", "url": "https://elderscrolls.fandom.com/wiki?curid=132886", "title": "Vampire Lord", "text": "Vampire Lord is a &lt;a href=\"Powers%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;power&lt;/a&gt; available in , that serves as an extension of &lt;a href=\"Vampirism%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;traditional vampirism&lt;/a&gt;. During the &lt;a href=\"Quests%20%28Dawnguard%29\"&gt;quest&lt;/a&gt; \"&lt;a href=\"Bloodline\"&gt;Bloodline&lt;/a&gt;,\" the &lt;a href=\"Last%20Dragonborn\"&gt;Dragonborn&lt;/a&gt; chooses either to continue to assist the Dawnguard or to join &lt;a href=\"Harkon\"&gt;Harkon&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Volkihar%20Clan%20%28Dawnguard%29\"&gt;Volkihar Clan&lt;/a&gt;. Choosing the path of Harkon grants the ability to become a Vampire Lord, although it's still possible to obtain this form if the path of the Dawnguard is chosen.\nVampire Lords have an altered and sinister appearance, one that is more drastically and artfully constructed than that of a regular &lt;a href=\"Vampire%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;vampire&lt;/a&gt;. The Vampire Lord features eleven unique perks and two combat modes\u2014Melee Mode and Blood Magic mode. Of the newly added spells is the ability to use &lt;a href=\"%23Drain%20Life\"&gt;consumed blood&lt;/a&gt; to vitalize the Vampire Lord and the ability to &lt;a href=\"Summon%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;summon&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Gargoyle%20%28Dawnguard%29\"&gt;Gargoyles&lt;/a&gt; the way &lt;a href=\"atronach\"&gt;atronach&lt;/a&gt;s are summoned via the use of &lt;a href=\"Conjuration%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Conjuration magic&lt;/a&gt;. The power bite attack adds a &lt;a href=\"Kill%20Camera\"&gt;unique cinematic&lt;/a&gt; where the Vampire Lord wraps its wings around the victim and bites them on the neck.\nBackground.\nVampire Lords are considered to be the paragon of the species. They are typically pure-blooded vampires who have either received their vampirism through another pure-blooded vampire or &lt;a href=\"Molag%20Bal\"&gt;Molag Bal&lt;/a&gt; himself.\nAcquisition.\nHarkon or Serana can grant this power during the main questline for . Harkon offers this power during \"Bloodline,\" and Serana offers it twice: once during \"&lt;a href=\"Chasing%20Echoes\"&gt;Chasing Echoes&lt;/a&gt;,\" and once more upon completing \"&lt;a href=\"Kindred%20Judgment\"&gt;Kindred Judgment&lt;/a&gt;.\" The latter time, she can be asked to do it indefinetly should the player be cured again.\nTransformation.\nWhen transforming into a Vampire Lord, the body undergoes drastic changes. In addition to wings sprouting from the back and height vastly increasing, the skin will pale, the eyes will change to an orange-gold hue, and the cheeks will narrow prominently.\nThe wings grant the ability for much faster movement speed while sprinting, and the ability to hover allows the Vampire Lord to pass effortlessly over bodies of water. In addition, carry weight is ignored, so an over-encumbered Vampire may utilize this form for faster movement.\nAs a Vampire Lord, the four stages of &lt;a href=\"Vampirism%20%28Skyrim%29%23Stages%20of%20Vampirism%20and%20their%20effects\"&gt;vampirism&lt;/a&gt; still apply, and as time passes without &lt;a href=\"Vampirism%20%28Skyrim%29%23Feeding\"&gt;feeding&lt;/a&gt;, the more severe these changes become. In direct sunlight, Vampire Lords suffer the same limitations, such as stunted and decreased &lt;a href=\"Health%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Health&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Magicka%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Magicka&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Stamina%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Stamina&lt;/a&gt;. However, weaknesses and resistances to fire and frost are significantly altered with the addition of :\nCombat modes.\nThere are two modes of combat for a Vampire Lord:\nBlood Magic mode.\nThis mode allows the Vampire Lord to hover above the ground and cast &lt;a href=\"%23Blood%20Magic\"&gt;Blood Magic spells&lt;/a&gt;. This mode can be augmented with &lt;a href=\"Ring%20of%20the%20Erudite\"&gt;Ring of the Erudite&lt;/a&gt;, which grants 100 extra Magicka, as well as faster Magicka regeneration.\nMelee Mode.\nThis mode allows the Vampire Lord to fight on the ground, but in doing so, all Blood Magic spells cannot be used. Instead, the primary means of combat are claw attacks. Melee mode is the only mode where the &lt;a href=\"%23Power%20attack%20bite\"&gt;Power attack bite&lt;/a&gt; can be performed.\nThis mode can be augmented with the Poison Talons perk, which grants claw attacks 20 points of &lt;a href=\"Poison%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;poison damage&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Ring%20of%20the%20Beast\"&gt;Ring of the Beast&lt;/a&gt;, which grants claw attacks an additional 20 points of damage.\nPerks.\nThe Vampire Lord &lt;a href=\"Skills%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;skill tree&lt;/a&gt; includes eleven perks. The left side of the tree deals with Night Powers, the right side deals with Blood Magic and the central column consists of passive perks that function like &lt;a href=\"Abilities%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;abilities&lt;/a&gt;.\nConsuming life blood through a power attack bite or a Drain Life &lt;a href=\"Spells%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;spell&lt;/a&gt; allows new perks to be gained.\nPerk points allocated to the tree cannot be undone, although the vampirism can be cured through &lt;a href=\"Rising%20at%20Dawn\"&gt;Falion's ritual&lt;/a&gt;. Requiring a filled &lt;a href=\"Black%20Soul%20Gem%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Black Soul Gem&lt;/a&gt;, the affliction is reversed, but all perks remain. &lt;a href=\"Aela%20the%20Huntress%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Aela the Huntress&lt;/a&gt; offers &lt;a href=\"Lycanthropy%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;lycanthropy&lt;/a&gt; as a poultice for the vampirism. Unlocking perks in the &lt;a href=\"Werewolf%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;werewolf&lt;/a&gt; skill tree also remain if the Dragonborn becomes a vampire again.\nFeedings.\nEach new perk requires a few more feedings than the last. A total of 156 people need to be fed upon to complete the entire tree.\nNight Powers.\nNight Powers are activated like &lt;a href=\"Powers%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;powers&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"shouts\"&gt;shouts&lt;/a&gt; and have an associated cooldown period. They all cost magicka to activate.\nBats.\nThis power is unlocked by default. It allows the Dragonborn to turn into a cloud of bats then flies forward several feet before reforming as a Vampire Lord. It can be activated twice in quick succession, but then requires a 20-second cooldown.\nThis power can be augmented with the &lt;a href=\"Amulet%20of%20Bats\"&gt;Amulet of Bats&lt;/a&gt;, which adds a knockback stun when flying in the direction of enemies, but only if the Night Cloak perk has been unlocked.\nVampire Sight.\nThis power is unlocked by default. It works exactly like &lt;a href=\"Vampire%27s%20Sight\"&gt;Vampire's Sight&lt;/a&gt; when reaching stage one of &lt;a href=\"Vampirism%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;vampirism&lt;/a&gt;. The effect grants &lt;a href=\"Night%20Vision\"&gt;Night Vision&lt;/a&gt; for 60 seconds.\nDetect All Creatures.\nThis works similar to the &lt;a href=\"Aura%20Whisper\"&gt;Aura Whisper&lt;/a&gt; shout and a combination of &lt;a href=\"Detect%20Life%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Detect Life&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Detect%20Dead\"&gt;Detect Dead&lt;/a&gt; spells. It sends out a sonar-like pulse that reveals all forms of life, living or undead, in a white aura for a few seconds. It also reveals the location of corpses. Cooldown takes 3 seconds.\nMist Form.\nThis power simply transforms the Dragonborn into an invulnerable cloud of mist for 23 seconds. During this time, health, magicka, and stamina regenerate. The invulnerability effect is similar to the &lt;a href=\"Become%20Ethereal\"&gt;Become Ethereal&lt;/a&gt; shout in that even fall damage is negated. Cooldown takes 33 seconds.\nSupernatural Reflexes.\nThis power works somewhat similar to the &lt;a href=\"Slow%20Time\"&gt;Slow Time&lt;/a&gt; shout. When activated, time grinds to a near halt for 23 seconds, but the Dragonborn won't be affected as much by the disparity. Cooldown takes 45 seconds.\nBlood Magic.\nBlood Magic deals with &lt;a href=\"Spells%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;spells&lt;/a&gt; that are typically wielded in the left hand and can only be used in &lt;a href=\"%23Blood%20Magic%20mode\"&gt;Blood Magic mode&lt;/a&gt;.\nDrain Life.\nThis spell is unlocked by default. It is the core offensive spell in the Vampire Lord's arsenal and is permanently equipped in the right hand when in Blood Magic mode. It works similar to the original &lt;a href=\"Vampiric%20Drain%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Vampiric Drain&lt;/a&gt; in that it &lt;a href=\"Absorb%20Health%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;absorbs health&lt;/a&gt;, but rather than a stream of energy, it is an &lt;a href=\"Area%20of%20Effect\"&gt;area-of-effect&lt;/a&gt; projectile similar to the &lt;a href=\"Fireball%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;fireball&lt;/a&gt; spell. Killing creatures or people with this spell allows new perks to be gained.\nThis spell can be augmented with the &lt;a href=\"Blood%20of%20the%20Ancients\"&gt;Blood of the Ancients&lt;/a&gt; ability, which temporarily upgrades the spell to drain magicka and stamina in addition to health. The ability can be accessed upon completion of \"&lt;a href=\"The%20Bloodstone%20Chalice\"&gt;The Bloodstone Chalice&lt;/a&gt;.\"\nRaise Dead.\nThis spell is unlocked by default. It's essentially a very powerful version of the &lt;a href=\"Raise%20Zombie\"&gt;Raise Zombie&lt;/a&gt; spell because it can raise almost any creature or person for 120 seconds. Anything reanimated with this spell collapses into ash piles after being killed again, or when the spell duration ends. It is not affected by the &lt;a href=\"Twin%20Souls\"&gt;Twin Souls&lt;/a&gt; perk in the &lt;a href=\"Conjuration%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Conjuration&lt;/a&gt; skill tree.\nVampiric Grip.\nVampiric Grip is similar to the &lt;a href=\"Telekinesis%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Telekinesis&lt;/a&gt; spell, except it affects almost any creature or character instead of an item, which can be lifted off the ground and held in the air at the cost of Magicka upkeep. The target can then be flung into the air by releasing the spell. The only creatures that are not affected are &lt;a href=\"Dragons%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Dragons&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Mammoth%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;mammoths&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Dragon%20Priests%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Dragon Priests&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Mistmen\"&gt;Mistmen&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Boneman%20%28Dawnguard%29\"&gt;Bonemen&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Wrathman%20%28Dawnguard%29\"&gt;Wrathmen&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Skeleton%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Skeletons&lt;/a&gt;.\nSummon Gargoyle.\nThis spell works much like any other &lt;a href=\"Conjuration%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;conjuration&lt;/a&gt; spell. Casting the spell at the ground will summon a &lt;a href=\"Gargoyle%20%28Dawnguard%29\"&gt;Gargoyle&lt;/a&gt; for 120 seconds. This spell can be augmented with the &lt;a href=\"Amulet%20of%20the%20Gargoyle\"&gt;Amulet of the Gargoyle&lt;/a&gt;, which summons an additional Gargoyle for 30 seconds.\nCorpse Curse.\nThis spell works exactly like the &lt;a href=\"Paralyze%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Paralyze&lt;/a&gt; spell.

Nonetheless, interviews with Temple officials persuade me that the &lt;a href=\"Dunmer\"&gt;Dunmer&lt;/a&gt; of Morrowind are experienced and knowledgeable in the handling of these menaces. On the other hand, they freely admit that even a large community of vampires might easily escape detection in the remote wastelands, or in the subterranean labyrinths of abandoned strongholds and wizard towers...\n...The \"&lt;a href=\"ash%20vampire\"&gt;ash vampire&lt;/a&gt;\" of &lt;a href=\"Ashlanders%20%28Morrowind%29\"&gt;Ashlanders&lt;/a&gt; legend is not &lt;a href=\"Undead%20%28Morrowind%29\"&gt;undead&lt;/a&gt;.

The &lt;a href=\"Quarra\"&gt;Quarra&lt;/a&gt; bloodline features exceptional strength and endurance, and attacks in a state of ecstatic frenzy. &lt;a href=\"Aundae\"&gt;Aundae&lt;/a&gt; vampires are potent spellcasters, seeking to hypnotize victims before feeding, while the swift and agile &lt;a href=\"Clan%20Berne%20%28Morrowind%29\"&gt;Clan Berne&lt;/a&gt; vampires prefer stealth and ambush, first poisoning the victim with a bite, then withdrawing to a safe distance, returning to feed only when the prey has weakened...\n...It is supposed that vampirism is contracted from wounds received from a vampire. Since few victims survive vampiric attacks or feedings, the process of contracting the disease is little understood. Some have suggested that victims may willingly submit themselves to the will of a vampire, but no real evidence of this exists...\n...During the incubation phase, lasting up to 72 hours, the vampirism disease exhibits no symptoms, and may be cured by general spellcraft or &lt;a href=\"Imperial%20Cult\"&gt;cult&lt;/a&gt; blessings. However, during incubation, some victims have reported sleep disturbances and troubling dreams. After symptoms are exhibited, however, the disease is incurable and irreversible..."}

In the West, a shadowy fraternity of &lt;a href=\"Vampire%20%28Morrowind%29\"&gt;vampire&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Vampire%20Hunters\"&gt;hunters&lt;/a&gt; is believed to be primarily composed of formerly afflicted vampires who have been cured of the disease. According to legend, the Vampire Hunters refuse to reveal the cure to the disease for fear that it may encourage depraved thrill seekers from deliberately infecting themselves.\nIn the East, the Western tradition of Vampire Hunters is unknown. &lt;a href=\"Vampirism%20%28Morrowind%29\"&gt;Vampirism&lt;/a&gt; is known to be incurable, and even if it were curable, a cured vampire would be an abomination to be destroyed. Since the disease is infallibly cured if treated within three days, failure to treat oneself after an encounter with a vampire would be considered a deliberate attempt to contract the disease, and a mark of monstrous depravity...\n... In &lt;a href=\"Tribunal%20Temple\"&gt;Temple&lt;/a&gt; doctrine, one ancient tradition holds that, among his many other crimes, &lt;a href=\"Molag%20Bal\"&gt;Molag Bal&lt;/a&gt;, the Father of Monsters, spawned the first vampire upon the corpse of a defeated foe. Several different versions of this story exist, with the foe variously identified as a &lt;a href=\"Daedra\"&gt;Daedra&lt;/a&gt; Lord, a Temple Saint, or a powerful beast creature. This account of the origin of vampirism is peculiar to &lt;a href=\"Morrowind\"&gt;Morrowind&lt;/a&gt;, appearing nowhere else in &lt;a href=\"Imperials%20%28Morrowind%29\"&gt;Imperial&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"lore\"&gt;lore&lt;/a&gt;. Unfortunately, scholarly inquiry upon this topic is discouraged by the Temple, which controls access to the only substantial collection of historical and cultural records in Morrowind...\n... Though the &lt;a href=\"Dunmer%20%28Morrowind%29\"&gt;Dunmer&lt;/a&gt; believe the disease is incurable, a &lt;a href=\"Buoyant%20Armigers%20%28Morrowind%29\"&gt;Buoyant Armiger&lt;/a&gt; of former years named &lt;a href=\"Galur%20Rithari\"&gt;Galur Rithari&lt;/a&gt; insisted that he was cured of vampirism. Initially imprisoned by the Temple for heresy, he later recanted, was released, and served his final years as a librarian in the &lt;a href=\"Hall%20of%20Wisdom\"&gt;Hall of Wisdom&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Vivec%20City%20%28Morrowind%29\"&gt;Vivec City&lt;/a&gt;. It is interesting that previous to his imprisonment for heresy, Rithari had been posted to the Buoyant Armiger garrison at &lt;a href=\"Bal%20Ur%20%28Morrowind%29\"&gt;Bal Ur&lt;/a&gt;, a pilgrimage site known as the \"birthplace of Molag Bal.\""}

The &lt;a href=\"Iliac%20Bay\"&gt;Iliac Bay&lt;/a&gt; region alone has nine variations with unique powers and abilities. I have this information not only because I have been researching this blight of the world for the last ten years of my life, but because for the seven years before that, I was one of the creatures.\n&lt;a href=\"Vampirism%20%28Daggerfall%29\"&gt;Vampirism&lt;/a&gt; is a disease, like &lt;a href=\"Brain%20rot\"&gt;Brain rot&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"Cholera\"&gt;Cholera&lt;/a&gt;, but far, far more insidious. One can become a vampire through certain magical items or by the curse of a powerful wizard, but the most common cause is the bite or scratch of a vampire. There are no symptoms of vampirism except this -- if the victim sleeps after the attack but before he becomes a vampire, his sleep will be plagued with nightmares.\nDuring this two to four day period, when the disease has been spread but the victim is still mortal, most any temple healer can remove the curse of vampirism. There will be no further warning.\nI do not remember dying. I had been a scout for an order of knights which shall go nameless for this. A daughter of a local nobleman had been kidnapped by a mysterious character, and my captain had located his hideout. Deep in the dank underground chambers, I searched until I found the girl. Or what remained of her, a corpse the color of snow, drained of every drop of blood. I knew what the mystery man was right then, but he found me before I found the exit out. He took a good sized hunk out of my fighting arm before I managed to outrun him. I figured I was lucky to be alive. Some luck.\nMy trip back to the knightly order was a five day journey. I decided to get some rest early to get my arm in better shape in case I found any more trouble. I can't remember the dreams I had that night -- only that I was doing something horrible and I couldn't stop myself. I woke up screaming. The next night, at an inn a little closer to my destination, my sleep was deep and dreamless. On the third night, I died.\nOf course, I didn't know that I died. I had gone to sleep in a nice warm feathered bed and I woke on a cold wet stone mortuary slab. Dazed, I opened the door to the masoleum I was in, which I think must have been locked. I was in a cemetery not far from a town I knew, so I wandered in. It was late at night, so there were precious few souls in the streets. I paused to read a public notice and noticed the date. The date was two weeks later than I thought it must have been.\nAs I puzzled over that, I saw a girl, a wench at my favorite tavern in that town, wandering toward me. I hailed her. She ignored me. I called her by her name, and she turned to me, smiling, but with an expression that told me she did not know who I was. I had visited her tavern on my way over to the mystery man's hideout, but she didn't know me!\nI told her my name. She angrily told me that it was a very poor joke, that I looked nothing like the brave knight who used to visit the town, and that if I didn't know he was dead. My emotions were a tangled skein. I could tell she was not joking, that I looked nothing like myself. I was touched by her sorrow at my death, and horrified by the idea dawning on me of what I had become. Suddenly, an overriding instinct overcame all my thoughts -- hunger. Without even thinking about what I was doing, I reached out and tore her throat open. I drained her until she looked like the corpse in the mystery man's dungeon.\nThe rest of my story is told in Chapter Two.\nChapter II.\nI told in the first chapter of my story how I became a vampire and of my first kill. While it might (and, indeed, should) horrify the reader that my first victim was a friend of the mortal I used to be, it is my understanding that they are not uncommon first kills.\nI left the snow white corpse in the alley and ran to the only place I felt perversely safe, the . For the first couple days of my undeath, I starved myself while I considered my fate. I relearned what I was capable of doing, and found that I was stronger, faster, tougher, and more agile than before. I had powers that as a knight I had only seen powerful mages wield. Later, I discovered additional abilities, such as a total immunity to &lt;a href=\"Diseases%20%28Daggerfall%29\"&gt;disease&lt;/a&gt;. Helpful when descending on a plague-stricken city like a jackal.\nI also found my weaknesses. I could no longer stand the light of the sun -- exposure to it for longer than a few seconds burned me terribly. It also pained me to enter temples and other places of worship. The worst effect, of course, had to be my blood lust. If I did not kill a warm blooded creature once a night and drink its blood, my hunger would gnaw at me, and any wounds I suffered would not heal no matter how much I rested.\nIs this the moment for me to admit that there was a time I loved being a bloodsucking creature of the night? It is not impossible to live only at night, merely occasionally inconvenient. And I wouldn't have to kill humans every night, merely warm-blooded creatures. &lt;a href=\"Orsimer\"&gt;Orcs&lt;/a&gt; have a delicious, rich brothy blood; rats are a little sweet for the only meal of the night; &lt;a href=\"Werewolf%20%28Daggerfall%29\"&gt;Werewolves&lt;/a&gt; are a real treat, almost decadent the tincture between human and beast. A real gourmet's delight.\nAbout a month after I died, I was having the best time of my life. One night, I received a letter from someone who said he was \"family.\" Curious, I went to visit him at his tavern, and was told about the tribe of vampires to which I belonged -- the &lt;a href=\"Montalion\"&gt;Montalion&lt;/a&gt;. In return for me performing certain duties for the \"family,\" the man at the inn would train me in my vampiric abilities and skills.\nThough I never got very much detail, I surmised that the two main differences between the different vampire clans is geography and powers. Montalion alone have the gift for teleportation, but the other eight have powers of their own.\nMy mentor (that is the title he used) would congratulate me after each mission I performed, and came to trust me more and more. If asked, he would tell me about the Montalion's newest alliances, who they were manipulating, who they were stalking. It was then I started to become frightened at last. They, and all of their rival clans, were draining the blood of &lt;a href=\"Tamriel\"&gt;Tamriel&lt;/a&gt; itself.\nI panicked. I had to find a cure. But nowhere could I find any &lt;a href=\"Books%20%28Daggerfall%29\"&gt;book&lt;/a&gt; or rumor suggesting that vampirism is anything but permanent. So I resolved to kill myself, but I wanted to bring the Montalion down with me. I joined guilds they opposed, and failed any mission given to me spectacularly. I thought my mentor would turn against me, but he only became quieter, less forthcoming with information, never violent. He was not concerned. He had probably seen vampires like me before.\nHere's why he never attacked me: immortals can afford to be eternally patient.\nAt last, he refused to give me any further missions. He wouldn't even talk with me, but he never left his tavern. I could come and go, and he'd watch but never talk. That's when I got another letter.\nThere are several of us, you see, former vampires who know what to look for. We're patient too: we learned it in our unlife. We watch and listen, and anonymously contact the vampires we know wish to end the curse.\nEnding the curse is possible, but only just. It is very dangerous, but when you are cursed, the only real danger is no escape."}

However, Vicente is killed by the &lt;a href=\"Hero%20of%20Kvatch\"&gt;Hero of Kvatch&lt;/a&gt; during the quest &lt;a href=\"The%20Purification\"&gt;The Purification&lt;/a&gt;, so if one wishes to become a vampire, the dark gift should be accepted as soon as possible. This is also the only way to become a vampire if the Hero has already been cured once.\nStages of infection.\nAs the severity of vampirism increases, the vampire's weakness and strengths enhance. Some effects are constant across the infection, while others are dynamic. The vampirism increases one stage each 24 hours gone without feeding, upon the next sleep or &lt;a href=\"wait\"&gt;wait&lt;/a&gt;.\nVampire nightmares.\nEach change from one stage to the next triggers a nightmare after sleeping or waiting. The effects are applied, and a message appears, describing one of the Vampire nightmares, chosen randomly.\nFeeding.\nTo feed, approach a sleeping &lt;a href=\"Character%20Classes%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;NPC&lt;/a&gt; and interact with them. The choice to feed then appears. Feeding reverts the vampire back to the first stage of vampirism. Feeding on a &lt;a href=\"City%20Guard%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;guard&lt;/a&gt; sleeping in a barrack nets a 40 &lt;a href=\"Crime%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;bounty&lt;/a&gt; and immediately wakes them up. &lt;a href=\"Sneak%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;Sneaking&lt;/a&gt; decreases the chances of being caught while feeding. If the vampire is witnessed feeding on a victim, the witness sounds the guard.\nCuring vampirism.\nAside from the &lt;a href=\"Vampire%20Cure%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;Vampire Cure&lt;/a&gt;, initiated by &lt;a href=\"Raminus%20Polus\"&gt;Raminus Polus&lt;/a&gt; of the &lt;a href=\"Arcane%20University%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;Arcane University&lt;/a&gt;, the only method for curing vampirism that does not involve the use of &lt;a href=\"Console%20Commands%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;console commands&lt;/a&gt; is the &lt;a href=\"Font%20of%20Renewal\"&gt;Font of Renewal&lt;/a&gt;. Added through the DLC, &lt;a href=\"The%20Vile%20Lair\"&gt;The Vile Lair&lt;/a&gt;, this &lt;a href=\"magic\"&gt;magic&lt;/a&gt; fountain cures vampirism instantly upon activation. The Font is located in &lt;a href=\"Deepscorn%20Hollow%20%28Oblivion%20Location%29\"&gt;Deepscorn Hollow&lt;/a&gt;.\nOnce vampirism has been cured, the only way the Hero can contract it again without console commands is with the Dark Brotherhood Quest \"Darkness Eternal\"."}

Vampirism has various effects on the character's appearance, &lt;a href=\"resistance\"&gt;resistance&lt;/a&gt;s and even adds a new &lt;a href=\"Skills%20%28Online%29\"&gt;skill&lt;/a&gt; tree. It has four stages of severity, with every stage making the negative effects stronger but also reducing the cost of vampiric abilities. Stage one is the least severe one and four the most severe. Over time vampirism progresses to higher levels, and &lt;a href=\"Feed%20%28Online%29\"&gt;feeding&lt;/a&gt; on NPCs or other players resets vampirism to stage one.\nThe strain of vampirism that exists in \"The Elder Scrolls Online\" is known as &lt;a href=\"Noxiphilic%20Sanguivoria%20%28Disease%29\"&gt;Noxiphilic Sanguivoria&lt;/a&gt;. Vampirism was revamped with the update; power increases as one feeds, and new abilities and animations were introduced.\nGetting infected.\nThe player can get infected with vampirism by getting attacked by a special kind of &lt;a href=\"Bloodfiend\"&gt;Bloodfiend&lt;/a&gt; character. The ones that can infect the player can be found (albeit rarely) in the &lt;a href=\"zones\"&gt;zones&lt;/a&gt; where each alliance's last questline takes place: &lt;a href=\"Reaper%27s%20March\"&gt;Reaper's March&lt;/a&gt; for the &lt;a href=\"Aldmeri%20Dominion%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Aldmeri Dominion&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"The%20Rift%20%28Online%29\"&gt;The Rift&lt;/a&gt; for the &lt;a href=\"Ebonheart%20Pact\"&gt;Ebonheart Pact&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Bangkorai\"&gt;Bangkorai&lt;/a&gt; for the &lt;a href=\"Daggerfall%20Covenant\"&gt;Daggerfall Covenant&lt;/a&gt;, but only on a New Moon. Another way of obtaining the disease is by being fed on by another player who is afflicted with vampirism. Lastly it can be bought from the &lt;a href=\"Crown%20Store\"&gt;Crown Store&lt;/a&gt; for 1,500 &lt;a href=\"Crowns\"&gt;Crowns&lt;/a&gt;. Any player with\u00a0&lt;a href=\"Lycanthropy%20%28Online%29\"&gt;lycanthropy&lt;/a&gt;\u00a0is immune to vampirism and vice versa. After being infected the player will have to travel to the ritual site which can be found in the zones mentioned above.\nNegative effects.\nEvery vampire has a weakness to &lt;a href=\"Fire%20Damage%20%28Online%29\"&gt;fire damage&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Health%20Recovery\"&gt;regenerates health&lt;/a&gt; more slowly than as a humanoid. Their regular (non-vampire) &lt;a href=\"Abilities%20%28Online%29\"&gt;abilities&lt;/a&gt; cost more as well, with vampire abilities costing less. These effects increase with each stage. &lt;a href=\"Feeding\"&gt;Feeding&lt;/a&gt; increase your stage; every 4 hours that pass without feeding will reduce a stage. Note that having the &lt;a href=\"Blade%20of%20Woe%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Blade of Woe&lt;/a&gt; may require you to step farther back behind a humanoid NPC to feed. Using vampire abilities no longer advance your stage. Three items can affect stages: &lt;a href=\"Corrupting%20Bloody%20Mara\"&gt;Corrupting Bloody Mara&lt;/a&gt; increases stage to 4 by drinking, while drinking &lt;a href=\"Purifying%20Bloody%20Mara\"&gt;Purifying Bloody Mara&lt;/a&gt; or activating &lt;a href=\"Basin%20of%20Loss\"&gt;Basin of Loss&lt;/a&gt; decreases by 1.\nVampire skill tree.\nUltimate ability:\nActive abilities:\nPassive abilities:"}
{"id": "41730", "revid": "26213507", "url": "https://elderscrolls.fandom.com/wiki?curid=41730", "title": "Vampirism (Skyrim)", "text": "Vampirism is a syndrome that is acquired after the &lt;a href=\"Diseases%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;disease&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Sanguinare%20Vampiris\"&gt;Sanguinare Vampiris&lt;/a&gt; has infected the body longer than three in-game &lt;a href=\"day\"&gt;day&lt;/a&gt;s. &lt;a href=\"Sun%20Damage%20%28Dawnguard%29\"&gt;Harmed by sunlight&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Vampire%20%28Skyrim%29%23Stigma\"&gt;stigmatized&lt;/a&gt; by &lt;a href=\"mortal\"&gt;mortal&lt;/a&gt;s, and infamous for their unquenchable thirst for blood, vampires go to extreme lengths to hide their ailment or even their entire presence from mortals. In , Vampires acquire special &lt;a href=\"Magic%20%28Dawnguard%29\"&gt;magical&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Spells%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;spells&lt;/a&gt; as their level of infection increases. To offset this advantage, vulnerabilities to &lt;a href=\"Fire%20Damage%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;fire&lt;/a&gt; and sunlight are also conferred. Vampirism can be contracted and cured an unlimited number of times. If the infection has rooted before three days have passed, a &lt;a href=\"Potions%20%28Skyrim%29%23Cure%20Condition\"&gt;Potion of Cure Disease&lt;/a&gt; can be ingested to cure Sanguinare Vampiris, which, as previously mentioned, is the disease that eventually leads to Vampirism. Alternatively, praying at a &lt;a href=\"Shrines%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;shrine&lt;/a&gt; cures it. Otherwise, the only method for removing the disease is to speak to &lt;a href=\"Falion%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Falion&lt;/a&gt;, the thaumaturge of &lt;a href=\"Morthal%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Morthal&lt;/a&gt;. He requires a filled &lt;a href=\"Black%20Soul%20Gem%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Black Soul Gem&lt;/a&gt; to &lt;a href=\"%23Curing%20vampirism\"&gt;cure vampirism&lt;/a&gt;.\nVampirism comes in four stages of severity. The severity of the infection increases the longer the vampire goes without drinking blood. Sleeping humans can be fed on to keep the curse at bay. Spectators of a feeding become hostile and report the crime to &lt;a href=\"Hold%20Guard\"&gt;Hold Guard&lt;/a&gt;s. Feeding accrues a &lt;a href=\"Bounty%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;bounty&lt;/a&gt; of 40 in the corresponding &lt;a href=\"Hold\"&gt;Hold&lt;/a&gt;. The crime cannot be paid off with or &lt;a href=\"Prison%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;jail time&lt;/a&gt;. Upon reaching stage four of vampirism, mortals can detect the vampire more easily, attacking or fleeing almost upon sight.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Official%20Add-ons%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;add-on&lt;/a&gt; adds a &lt;a href=\"Vampire%20Lord\"&gt;Vampire Lord&lt;/a&gt; ability with eleven perks to unlock through &lt;a href=\"leveling%20up\"&gt;leveling up&lt;/a&gt;. The &lt;a href=\"Last%20Dragonborn\"&gt;Dragonborn&lt;/a&gt; opens up the skill tree by siding with &lt;a href=\"Lord%20Harkon\"&gt;Lord Harkon&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Volkihar%20Clan%20%28Dawnguard%29\"&gt;Volkihar Clan&lt;/a&gt; to help actuate the &lt;a href=\"Tyranny%20of%20the%20Sun\"&gt;Tyranny of the Sun&lt;/a&gt; prophecy foretold in the &lt;a href=\"Elder%20Scroll%20%28Lore%29\"&gt;Elder Scrolls&lt;/a&gt;. Unlocking all eleven perks garners players an &lt;a href=\"Achievements%20%28Dawnguard%29\"&gt;achievement&lt;/a&gt;. In addition, &lt;a href=\"Characters%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;characters&lt;/a&gt; no longer turn hostile when the Dragonborn is at stage four vampirism, but they will if they are in Vampire Lord form.\nContracting Vampirism.\nSanguinare Vampiris.\n&lt;a href=\"Sanguinare%20Vampiris\"&gt;Sanguinare Vampiris&lt;/a&gt; is the disease that eventually culminates in vampirism and is typically contracted when attacked by a vampire, either with physical attacks or being subject to their Vampiric Drain spell. If one is attacked by Vampiric Drain, there is a 10% chance of infection.\nIf the disease has not been cured (via a &lt;a href=\"Cure%20Disease%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Cure Disease&lt;/a&gt; potion or praying at a &lt;a href=\"Shrines%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;shrine&lt;/a&gt;) within three days, the infection mutates into full vampirism, causing a series of maladaptive and beneficial traits to emerge in the subject. Drinking blood can stay the infection and lessen the deficits of the disease.\nIn \"Dawnguard\", drinking from the bloodspring in &lt;a href=\"Redwater%20Den\"&gt;Redwater Den&lt;/a&gt; also allows the disease to be contracted.\nHarkon and Serana.\nVampirism can be directly contracted without contracting Sanguinare Vampiris by getting bitten by Harkon or Serana, which at the same time gives the Dragonborn the ability to become a Vampire Lord (&lt;a href=\"%23Vampire%20Lord\"&gt;see below&lt;/a&gt;).\nUsing console commands.\nIn PC versions of \"Skyrim\", the &lt;a href=\"Console%20Commands%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;console&lt;/a&gt; can be used to contract Vampirism without being bitten or waiting for the &lt;a href=\"%23Effects%20across%20all%20stages\"&gt;stages of the infection&lt;/a&gt; to progress. It can be done with the codice_1 command; for example, to change into a &lt;a href=\"Bosmer%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Bosmer&lt;/a&gt; vampire, codice_2 must be entered. If a race other than the one that was selected at &lt;a href=\"Character%20Creation%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;character creation&lt;/a&gt; is chosen, the rendered Dragonborn will become bald. However, this method can lead to acquiring \"broken\" vampirism with most abilities and active effects missing. This can be fixed by feeding.\nAn alternative method of doing so is to type in the command codice_3. This will infect the player with the vanilla version of Sanguinare Vampiris. If one wants to be infected with the same disease, but wants the version, they should instead type in the command, codice_4. Obviously, this will only work if the \"Dawnguard\" add-on has been installed.\nImmunity to vampirism.\nWhile infected with &lt;a href=\"Lycanthropy%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Lycanthropy&lt;/a&gt; as a result of getting involved in &lt;a href=\"the%20Companions\"&gt;the Companions&lt;/a&gt; questline, or when otherwise engaged in &lt;a href=\"Beast%20Form%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Beast Form&lt;/a&gt; as a result of a bug related to &lt;a href=\"Hircine%27s%20Ring%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Hircine's Ring&lt;/a&gt;, player characters effectively become fully immune to vampirism, as they cannot contract the pre-requisite &lt;a href=\"Sanguinare%20Vampiris\"&gt;Sanguinare Vampiris&lt;/a&gt; disease. &lt;a href=\"Argonians%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Argonians&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Bosmer%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Bosmer&lt;/a&gt; are naturally &lt;a href=\"Resist%20Disease%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;resistant to disease&lt;/a&gt;, being 50% less likely than other races to contract vampirism, while the rest may additionally equip &lt;a href=\"Enchanting%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;enchantments&lt;/a&gt; or drink &lt;a href=\"Resist%20Disease%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;resist disease&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Potions%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;potions&lt;/a&gt; to avoid infection. &lt;a href=\"Hevnoraak\"&gt;Hevnoraak's&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Hevnoraak%20%28Mask%29\"&gt;mask&lt;/a&gt; will grant resistance against diseases and infections.\nNote that, regardless of any other preventative measures taken, opting to become a &lt;a href=\"Vampire%20Lord\"&gt;Vampire Lord&lt;/a&gt; will inflict the status instantly, removing &lt;a href=\"Lycanthropy%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Lycanthropy&lt;/a&gt; if already present. It's also possible to become a vampire while retaining Lycanthropy via console commands.\nPhysical appearance.\nVampires are easily distinguishable from a non-infected individual. As a result of the , the infected slowly grow paler. Fangs protrude from their gums, allowing for easier feeding of blood. Eye color changes from the spectrum of average hues to red.\nWhen infected, the fur of the &lt;a href=\"Khajiit%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Khajiit&lt;/a&gt; alters as the skin of a human or elf would. Long-toothed by nature, the incisors of the Khajiit grow exceptionally long, so that they protrude below the lip. Their pupils also become slit-like. Similarly with the Argonians; they grow pairs of double fangs which protrude from the upper jaw at the front of the mouth, the eyes (if not already slit) will become pale and slit-like, and the color of the scales grow grayer as the infection worsens.\nStages of vampirism and their effects.\nAfter approximately twenty-four hours without feeding, a vampire progresses a stage. &lt;a href=\"%23Feeding\"&gt;Feeding&lt;/a&gt; always brings the vampire back to stage one. Without \"Dawnguard\" installed, characters become hostile toward the vampire as the infection deteriorates, attacking them on sight. \"Dawnguard\" removes this penalty and people will treat a blood-starved vampire like any other person.\nEffects across all stages.\nThese effects exist across all stages of infection and are perpetually active:\nNecromage.\nSince becoming a Vampire classifies the Dragonborn as &lt;a href=\"Undead%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;undead&lt;/a&gt;, they will gain the effect of the &lt;a href=\"Necromage%20%28Perk%29\"&gt;Necromage&lt;/a&gt; perk (if chosen as a &lt;a href=\"Restoration%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Restoration&lt;/a&gt; skill). Necromage enhances all buffs and debuffs by 25%. A basic Vampire character at stage four raises its Resist Frost to 62.5%; likewise with its Weakness to Fire to 62.5%.\nThe interesting feature of this perk is that all &lt;a href=\"Enchanting%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Enchantments&lt;/a&gt; count as buffs and will be increased by 25%. Essentially, everything in &lt;a href=\"Active%20Effect\"&gt;Active Effect&lt;/a&gt;s is enhanced by this perk.\nHostility.\nIf the Dragonborn is at stage four of vampirism without the \"Dawnguard\" add-on, to avoid hostile characters, they must travel by night and avoid places where a vampiric infection would be noticed.\nBecause vampirism bolsters &lt;a href=\"Illusion%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Illusion&lt;/a&gt; spells, casting spells such as &lt;a href=\"Pacify\"&gt;Pacify&lt;/a&gt; on characters can prevent them from attacking a vampire. Perks such as \"Kindred Mage\" and \"Hypnotic Gaze\" may need to be unlocked first for higher-leveled people to be affected by the spell.\nFeeding.\nDrinking the blood of the uninfected stays the vampiric infection. Levels of vampirism can be reversed simply by drinking blood.\nFeeding accrues a bounty of 40 in the corresponding holds, if caught. &lt;a href=\"Sneak%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Sneak&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Muffle\"&gt;Muffle&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Invisibility%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;invisibility&lt;/a&gt; are powerless to decrease the chances of detection. There are two methods for feeding available to vampires:\nTypes of feeding.\nSleeping.\nTo feed, one must approach a sleeping humanoid and press the &lt;a href=\"Controls%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;interaction button&lt;/a&gt;. If successful, a black message box pops up with the options of \"Feed\" or \"Talk to &lt;character's name&gt;\". One must select feed to execute the feeding command. During the session, the vampire bends over the slumbering victim and the screen flashes a light magenta color. A message reading \"Your vampiric powers recede as you feed.\" is also displayed. The same person can be fed from multiple times in one night, or across nights, and they are never killed as a result of the feeding unless the Vampire Lord power is active at the time. As with &lt;a href=\"pickpocket\"&gt;pickpocket&lt;/a&gt;ing, incessant interaction with a target increases the chances that they will awaken.\nConscious.\nWith the addition of , conscious humanoids can be fed upon. It works similarly to the sleeping method, but requires the Dragonborn to cast the &lt;a href=\"Vampire%27s%20Seduction%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Vampire's Seduction&lt;/a&gt; spell on a person first. This spell is only available at stage two of vampirism and can only be used once per day. It only affects characters up to a certain level, so the target must be chosen carefully before casting the spell.\nThe dungeon in &lt;a href=\"Castle%20Volkihar\"&gt;Castle Volkihar&lt;/a&gt; has some &lt;a href=\"Vampire%20Cattle%20%28Dawnguard%29\"&gt;cattle&lt;/a&gt; that appear to be permanently affected by Vampire's Seduction and can be fed on while conscious.\nVampire Lord.\n, the first &lt;a href=\"Official%20Add-ons%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;official add-on&lt;/a&gt; for redesigned the vampire game mechanic, adding a perk &lt;a href=\"Skills%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;skill tree&lt;/a&gt; and revamping the physical appearance. During the &lt;a href=\"Quests%20%28Dawnguard%29\"&gt;quest&lt;/a&gt; called \"&lt;a href=\"Bloodline\"&gt;Bloodline&lt;/a&gt;\", the Dragonborn must decide whether to continue assisting the &lt;a href=\"Dawnguard%20%28Faction%29\"&gt;Dawnguard&lt;/a&gt; or join &lt;a href=\"Harkon\"&gt;Harkon&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Volkihar%20Clan%20%28Dawnguard%29\"&gt;Volkihar Clan&lt;/a&gt;. Choosing the path of Harkon grants the ability to become a Vampire Lord, unlocking the potential to utilize eleven unique perk abilities. It should be noted that siding with Dawnguard does not cancel the possibility of becoming Vampire Lord. Unless cured, &lt;a href=\"Serana\"&gt;Serana&lt;/a&gt; can make one both after \"&lt;a href=\"Chasing%20Echoes\"&gt;Chasing Echoes&lt;/a&gt;\" and \"&lt;a href=\"Kindred%20Judgment\"&gt;Kindred Judgment&lt;/a&gt;.\"\nAmong the newly added spells is the ability to &lt;a href=\"Drain%20Life\"&gt;drain life&lt;/a&gt; to vitalize the Vampire Lord and the ability to &lt;a href=\"Summon%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;summon&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Gargoyle%20%28Dawnguard%29\"&gt;Gargoyles&lt;/a&gt; the way &lt;a href=\"atronach\"&gt;atronach&lt;/a&gt;s are summoned via the use of &lt;a href=\"Conjuration%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Conjuration magic&lt;/a&gt;. The power bite attack adds &lt;a href=\"Kill%20Camera\"&gt;unique cinematics&lt;/a&gt; in which the Vampire Lord wraps its wings around the victim and bites them on the neck.\nCuring vampirism.\nLycanthropy.\nBecoming a Werewolf automatically cures vampirism. &lt;a href=\"Aela%20the%20Huntress%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Aela the Huntress&lt;/a&gt; turns the Dragonborn into a werewolf should they decide to join the Companions and become a member of the circle.\nConsole Commands.\nAnother way of curing vampirism is via Console Commands; one must open the console and type codice_6. By using the Console Command code codice_7 to change the Dragonborn's race, vampirism is immediately removed. This is also true of the codice_8 command.\nIf one is having trouble curing one's vampirism, or having trouble getting &lt;a href=\"Rising%20at%20Dawn\"&gt;Rising at Dawn&lt;/a&gt; quest to start (to clear it), a fix is to type in codice_9 instead. It is important to note that this will clear complete the Rising at Dawn quest.\nComparisons with other games.\nVampire factions.\nSociologically, vampires in &lt;a href=\"The%20Elder%20Scrolls\"&gt;previous games&lt;/a&gt; have a stronger presence, both in regards to how they are interacted with and the niche their demographic plays in the microcosms of the setting.\nSimilar to the Volkihar Clan in \"Dawnguard\", there are vampire factions and that can be joined. In \"Morrowind\", joining a Vampire Clan allocates additional &lt;a href=\"Attributes%20%28Morrowind%29\"&gt;attributes&lt;/a&gt; bonuses and &lt;a href=\"Fortify%20Skill%20%28Morrowind%29\"&gt;fortifications for skills&lt;/a&gt;. \"Skyrim\" excludes this feature, as does . A re-invented version of this game mechanic returned with \"Dawnguard\", but it was more closely integrated with the &lt;a href=\"Main%20Quest\"&gt;main storyline&lt;/a&gt; and the bonuses granted are based on perks given upon leveling up.\nVampires grouped together in clans in \"Daggerfall\" and \"Morrowind\"; members consisting solely of vampires from the same bloodline. This translates to \"Skyrim\" in form of &lt;a href=\"Laelette%20the%20Vampire\"&gt;Laelette&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Alva\"&gt;Alva&lt;/a&gt;'s interactions with &lt;a href=\"Movarth%20Piquine\"&gt;Movarth&lt;/a&gt; and his coven. Otherwise, most vampires encountered in \"Skyrim\" are uncivilized, wild, and virtually solitary, minus their thralls and slaves.\nBonuses and unique spells.\nIn both \"Morrowind\" and \"Oblivion\", vampires gained bonuses to attributes and skills simply upon becoming vampires. The eradication of the attribute system in \"Skyrim\" made garnering such bonuses obsolete. Vampire-specific spells and abilities such as Vampiric Drain and Embrace of Shadows replaced these attribute bonuses. In \"Oblivion\", a &lt;a href=\"Night-Eye%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;Night-Eye&lt;/a&gt;-based spell similar to Vampire's Sight did appear; however, the unique &lt;a href=\"Charm%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;Charm&lt;/a&gt; spell, &lt;a href=\"Enthralling%20Presence\"&gt;Enthralling Presence&lt;/a&gt;, was given at stage three vampirism. Again, \"Skyrim\"'s omission of Charm, as a castable spell, lends explanation to its exclusion.\nDisadvantages.\nIn regards to the disadvantages of vampirism, \"Oblivion\" has more differences from those in the vampires of \"Skyrim\". Instead of increasing Weakness to Fire by 25% at each stage of infection, \"Oblivion\" added 10%, with a minimum weakness of 20% and a maximum of 50%. Both \"Oblivion\" and \"Morrowind\" were without automatic health, magicka, and stamina regeneration, so being in sunlight did not stunt it.

He is the inspiration of magistrates and rulers, the patron of the &lt;a href=\"Imperial%20Legion\"&gt;Imperial Legion&lt;/a&gt;s and the comfort of the law-abiding citizen. Stendarr has evolved from his &lt;a href=\"Nord\"&gt;Nord&lt;/a&gt;ic origins into a deity of compassion or sometimes, righteous rule. He is said to have accompanied &lt;a href=\"Tiber%20Septim\"&gt;Tiber Septim&lt;/a&gt; in his later years. In early &lt;a href=\"Altmer\"&gt;Altmer&lt;/a&gt;i legends, Stendarr is the apologist of Men.\nChapels.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Chapel%20of%20Stendarr\"&gt;Chapel of Stendarr&lt;/a&gt; is located in &lt;a href=\"Chorrol\"&gt;Chorrol&lt;/a&gt;, and, according to legend, the &lt;a href=\"Gauntlets%20of%20the%20Divine%20Crusader\"&gt;Gauntlets of the Divine Crusader&lt;/a&gt; are located there.\nCults and followers.\n&lt;a href=\"Vigilants%20of%20Stendarr\"&gt;Vigilants of Stendarr&lt;/a&gt;.\nIn &lt;a href=\"Skyrim\"&gt;Skyrim&lt;/a&gt;, the fanatical Vigilants of Stendarr wander the countryside, looking to distribute justice. On being questioned, Vigilants say that they formed their order after the &lt;a href=\"Oblivion%20Crisis\"&gt;Oblivion Crisis&lt;/a&gt;. Their objective is to eradicate certain undesirables from &lt;a href=\"Nirn\"&gt;Nirn&lt;/a&gt;, namely &lt;a href=\"Necromancer%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;necromancers&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Conjurer%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;conjurers&lt;/a&gt;, and especially &lt;a href=\"Daedra\"&gt;Daedra&lt;/a&gt;. They are also involved in trying to expunge Daedric worshippers from houses. When the &lt;a href=\"Volkihar%20Vampire\"&gt;Volkihar Vampire&lt;/a&gt;s attacked, the Vigilants lost their main base of operations within Skyrim, known as the &lt;a href=\"Hall%20of%20the%20Vigilant\"&gt;Hall of the Vigilant&lt;/a&gt;, as well as the head of their Order, &lt;a href=\"Keeper%20Carcette\"&gt;Keeper Carcette&lt;/a&gt;. The Vigilants as a whole were under attack by the vampires, with only their bastion at &lt;a href=\"Stendarr%27s%20Beacon\"&gt;Stendarr's Beacon&lt;/a&gt; near the &lt;a href=\"Morrowind\"&gt;Morrowind&lt;/a&gt; border remaining as a safe location within Skyrim. It is unknown how many Vigilants of Stendarr remained after the attack, due to most Vigilants living as nomads and the ones with the knowledge of their numbers having been killed. Still, the Vigilants did engage with the vampires in the wilderness, though on occassion the vampires beat them and took on their garments in attempts to lure unsuspecting travelers.\n&lt;a href=\"Crusaders\"&gt;Crusaders&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe knightly Order dedicated to the Temple of Stendarr, the Crusaders are tasked with protecting His Temples and acting as his blade when the situation demands it. Much like the other knightly orders of the Divines, the Crusaders are involved in a variety of tasks. These include exorcisms of both homes and children, purging heretics aiming to weaken the faith, finding missing scholars, pacifying mad priests, delivering of items, finding holy relics, destroying cursed items of evil, cleansing locations plagued by undead, and safeguarding relics. In times where Stendarr is mad with the Temple, the Crusaders also perform rites of atonement. The Crusaders are also involved in healing the sick.\nArtifacts.\n&lt;a href=\"Gauntlets%20of%20the%20Crusader\"&gt;Gauntlets of the Crusader&lt;/a&gt;.\nStendarr gifted the Gauntlets of the Crusader to &lt;a href=\"Pelinal%20Whitestrake\"&gt;Pelinal Whitestrake&lt;/a&gt;. They were deemed lost for some time, but were eventually recovered by the &lt;a href=\"Knights%20of%20the%20Nine%20%28Faction%29\"&gt;Knights of the Nine&lt;/a&gt;. They were subsequently used by &lt;a href=\"Sir%20Casimir\"&gt;Sir Casimir&lt;/a&gt; when he fought in the &lt;a href=\"War%20of%20the%20Red%20Diamond\"&gt;War of the Red Diamond&lt;/a&gt;. Some time after Sir Casimir returned from war, he struck down a beggar in the Chapel of Stendarr in Chorrol, and the gauntlets slipped from his hands and lay immovable on the floor. They would eventually be picked up by the &lt;a href=\"Hero%20of%20Kvatch\"&gt;Hero of Kvatch&lt;/a&gt; after the hero displayed mercy by taking the curse put on Casimir's heir onto themselves.\n&lt;a href=\"Stendarr%27s%20Hammer\"&gt;Stendarr's Hammer&lt;/a&gt;.\nAccording to rumor, Stendarr was said to have wielded his eponymous hammer himself, and the weight of it was so immense as to require four men to lift. In &lt;a href=\"3E%20427\"&gt;3E 427&lt;/a&gt;, the hammer was displayed under guard at &lt;a href=\"Mournhold\"&gt;Mournhold&lt;/a&gt;'s &lt;a href=\"Museum%20of%20Artifacts\"&gt;Museum of Artifacts&lt;/a&gt; in Morrowind, having been acquired through unknown means by the museum's curator, &lt;a href=\"Torasa%20Aram\"&gt;Torasa Aram&lt;/a&gt;.

He believes that Areldur is hiding something and wants to know what and why.\nConfronting Areldur.\nConfronting Areldur causes him to confess (he is usually in the Chapel). Areldur has always known how to lift the curse and has had the ability to do it, but has been to unwilling to do what it takes. In order to lift Kellen's family curse, somebody else must take the curse on themselves.\nThe Hero can tell Areldur they will take on the curse. The shocked priest will explain that praying at the altar gives the Hero the means to lift the curse. Pray at the altar and the Hero will be granted the lesser power &lt;a href=\"Lay%20Hands\"&gt;Lay Hands&lt;/a&gt;. Cast this on Kellen, and the curse is lifted, but the Hero's fatigue is damaged. Kellen will become energetic the moment the spell is cast and will leap up from his bed and run around the Chapel Hall.

He can be found in &lt;a href=\"Candlehearth%20Hall\"&gt;Candlehearth Hall&lt;/a&gt; on the second floor. After hiring him as a &lt;a href=\"Followers%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;follower&lt;/a&gt; and wearing an &lt;a href=\"Amulet%20of%20Mara%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Amulet of Mara&lt;/a&gt;, Stenvar becomes a candidate for &lt;a href=\"Marriage%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;marriage&lt;/a&gt;. Stenvar can also be recruited to the\u00a0&lt;a href=\"Blades%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Blades&lt;/a&gt;.\nInteractions.\nMarriage.\nSimilar to all other marriage candidates, Stenvar opens a store if the &lt;a href=\"Last%20Dragonborn\"&gt;Dragonborn&lt;/a&gt; becomes his spouse. The Dragonborn can collect a minimum of 100 \u00a0daily, or choose to let the profits accumulate. Likewise, the Dragonborn can buy and sell goods with Stenvar.\nWhen the Dragonborn puts on the amulet of Mara and speaks to Stenvar, the following dialogue will ensue:\n\"An Amulet of Mara, you're looking for marriage, then?\"\nInterested in me, are you? \"Won't lie, I am. And you?\"\nIf the Dragonborn speaks to Stenvar after accepting his proposal, he will say \"You should tell the priest we're getting married. They'll take things from there.\" After arranging the wedding with Maramal at the Temple of Mara in Riften, Stenvar will say \"The wedding is soon. It'll be a good day,\" and, later, \"Who would have thought I'd be getting married?\" Once Stenvar and the Dragonborn begin courting (after he comments on the Amulet of Mara), his voice takes on a softer, more affectionate tone.\nFollower.\nStenvar's &lt;a href=\"Skills%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;skill&lt;/a&gt; specialties are\u00a0&lt;a href=\"Heavy%20Armor%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Heavy Armor&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Block%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Block&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Two-Handed%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Two-Handed&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Archery%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Archery&lt;/a&gt;.\nHe is quite skilled with two-handed weapons, which he mentions when the Dragonborn first meets him. His default equipment is &lt;a href=\"Steel%20Armor%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Steel Armor&lt;/a&gt;, a &lt;a href=\"Hunting%20Bow%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Hunting Bow&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Iron%20Arrow%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Iron Arrows&lt;/a&gt;, and an &lt;a href=\"Iron%20Greatsword%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Iron Greatsword&lt;/a&gt;. He is an excellent warrior, who is ideal to use due to his resiliency. He is also somewhat talkative, making a variety of remarks when visiting numerous locations throughout Skyrim.\nBecause Stenvar attacks aggressively, he is vulnerable to attacks from the Dragonborn, such as\u00a0&lt;a href=\"Arrows%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;arrows&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Spells%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;spells&lt;/a&gt;. Keeping the enemies attention focused on the Dragonborn is key for Stenvar to attack more effectively without losing as much &lt;a href=\"Health%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;health&lt;/a&gt;."}

On the &lt;a href=\"Calendar%20%28Daggerfall%29\"&gt;9th of Second Seed&lt;/a&gt; the Prince of Hunger Namira may be summoned, if the Agent agrees to pay a summoner of either a &lt;a href=\"Witch%20Coven\"&gt;Witch Coven&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Mages%20Guild%20%28Daggerfall%29\"&gt;Mages Guild&lt;/a&gt;, or a &lt;a href=\"Temples%20%28Daggerfall%29\"&gt;Temple&lt;/a&gt;.\nWalkthrough.\nThe Agent may approach a summoner at either the Mages Guild, a Temple, or a Witch Coven to summon one of the Daedric Princes. If the summoning occurs on the 2nd of Sun's Dawn, the Agent may receive a vision of Namira, whom immediately offers them a quest. Indeed, the Prince of Hunger recognises the need for power as it \"gnaws at the gut,\" and offers to \"fill\" the Agent's \"belly.\"\nA Hunger for Power.\nUpon accepting Namira's task the Agent will be informed that a \"&lt;a href=\"Vampire%20Ancient\"&gt;vampiric ancient&lt;/a&gt;\" will act as their \"stepping stone to power.\" Namira instructs the Agent to destroy the vampire in its lair, an act that will feed \"Namira's hunger,\" before meeting one of the Prince's apostles residing in another town. The apostle will then hand the Agent their reward, the &lt;a href=\"Ring%20of%20Namira%20%28Daggerfall%29\"&gt;Ring of Namira&lt;/a&gt;.\nWith that Namira disappears and the Agent should head to the vampire ancient's lair, a &lt;a href=\"Dungeons%20%28Daggerfall%29\"&gt;dungeon&lt;/a&gt; located in the same &lt;a href=\"Regions%20%28Daggerfall%29\"&gt;region&lt;/a&gt; that Namira was summoned. Inside, the Agent may come across a number of vampire ancients wandering the halls, meaning they will have to keep slaying the undead until they receive the following notification:\n\"[Vampire ancient's name] is dead. Namira's hunger is sated -- now to satisfy your own desires by reporting to [Apostle's name].\"\nWith that, the Agent should escape the dungeon and meet with Namira's apostle, residing in a building in another town. Should the Agent arrive before the time limit expires, the apostle will reward the Agent with Namira's boon, to \"learn the meaning of hunger and fulfilment.\"\nRewards.\nCompleting the quest successfully within the time limit will see the Agent rewarded with the &lt;a href=\"Ring%20of%20Namira%20%28Daggerfall%29\"&gt;Ring of Namira&lt;/a&gt; by the Prince's apostle. The Agent will also receive a boost in reputation with the faction whom summoned the Prince for them, as well as the faction's associates. Conversely, failing the quest will result in the Agent losing reputation with the summoner's faction.\nThe changes made to reputation, either by successfully completing or failing the quest are shown below:"}

Over time, its casting becomes almost a matter of reflex: one is HERE, and then, by an act of will, one is THERE.\nIn fact, to the experienced practitioner, translocation becomes so routine that one almost forgets how difficult it was at first to learn. It is traditional to refer to this magical art as \"stepping through shadows,\" and indeed, the key to its mastery is the ability to \"peer sidewise\" and perceive the shadows cast by each entity and object in the &lt;a href=\"Aurbis\"&gt;Aurbis&lt;/a&gt;.\nThese are not, of course, the literal shadows cast by the blockage of light by an opaque object, but the emanation of the limen each object possesses\u2014the depth-impression its existence makes in the local reality of the &lt;a href=\"Mundus\"&gt;Mundus&lt;/a&gt;.

If a steward is moved to a new homestead, the Dragonborn will be unable to hire a different steward in the homestead where they originally held that position.\nSeveral &lt;a href=\"Followers%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;followers&lt;/a&gt; are available to serve as steward. They can only be appointed to three homesteads in Skyrim:\nStewards can also be recruited as followers again at any time, and this will not interrupt their stewarding duties. If a trainer or a quest-giver is hired as a steward, they do not lose these roles. If the steward chosen is a sellsword, the Dragonborn will still have to pay to recruit them as a follower.\nFollowers who can become Stewards.\nIf a follower is in close proximity to the homestead and they qualify for stewardship, they will initiate dialogue and remark that such a fine homestead needs a steward and will offer their services. Alternatively, a new dialogue option will appear for the follower while on the property if the follower qualifies for stewardship. Followers who qualify are listed below:\nInteractions.\nOnce a steward has been chosen, they can perform several tasks that can be considered too trivial or time consuming for the master of a homestead.\nHousing improvements.\nStewards can arrange for several additions to be added to the homestead. These include:\nBuying supplies.\nStewards will arrange for building supplies to be delivered to the main chest located next to the &lt;a href=\"Carpenter%27s%20Workbench\"&gt;Carpenter's Workbench&lt;/a&gt;. These include:\nFurnishing the homestead.\nRather than buying materials and crafting all the furnishings in a homestead, the Dragonborn can request that the Steward of the homestead deal with the whole process for a flat rate. If this option is chosen, the furnishings will not appear instantly as they do when crafted, rather, each piece of furniture will appear over a period, depending on the number of times the property's cell is loaded.\nThe cellar is the only part of the homestead that is required to be personally furnished, as the Steward considers it to be the Dragonborn's private room, thus is not obliged to have anything to do with its furnishment.\nThe decision to have the Steward attend to all the furnishing matters is one to be considered. Having the Steward do it is more expensive, but takes a lot less time which can then be devoted to adventuring. Conversely, buying all of the materials and crafting the furnishings costs only a fraction of what the Steward will charge; additionally, crafting the nails, hinges, locks and iron fittings raises the &lt;a href=\"Smithing%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Smithing&lt;/a&gt; skill.\nDismiss by console.\nA steward can be dismissed using the console.\nIf these commands are put into a bat file, then the EmptyRefAlias will fail. However, the other two will work, allowing the Dragonborn to appoint a new steward at that holding. The previous steward will still have steward dialogue.\nAppoint by console.\nA steward can be appointed using the console. Note that this only works for valid stewards.\nIf these commands are put into a bat file, then the EmptyRefAlias will fail. However, the other two will work, allowing the Dragonborn to appoint a new steward at that holding. The previous steward will still have steward dialogue."}

No blade will pierce their skin, no element will harm them - only by using bashing weapons can I hope to defeat them.\"\nWalkthrough.\nThe event takes place in an &lt;a href=\"Ayleid\"&gt;Ayleid&lt;/a&gt; Ruin, where the &lt;a href=\"Fugitive%20%28Blades%29\"&gt;Hero&lt;/a&gt; must face off against various enemies. At the start, there are two Skeleton Sentinels blocking the way. The room after the hallway is guarded by a &lt;a href=\"Spriggan%20%28Blades%29\"&gt;Spriggan Forest Speaker&lt;/a&gt; and another Skeleton Sentinel. Proceeding up the stairs, another Spriggan Forest Speaker and &lt;a href=\"Skeleton%20%28Blades%29\"&gt;Skeleton Sentinel&lt;/a&gt; are found.\nProceeding further up the stairs, the Hero will find a large, partially caved-in, room. Here, two Skeleton Sentinels and three Spriggan Forest Speakers will have to be fought to continue. Following up the stairs, the boss is found, a unique and more deadly Skeleton Sentinel guarding a Golden Chest.\nRewards.\nThe rewards for the quest vary depending on the difficulty it is completed on:\nStage 1: Easiest.\n3 Sigils, 8 &lt;a href=\"Miscellaneous%20Items%20%28Blades%29\"&gt;Dragon Bones&lt;/a&gt;\nStage 2: Easy.\n6 Sigils, 16 Dragon Bones\nStage 3: Medium.\n12 Sigils, 32 Dragon Bones\nStage 4: Hard.\n19 Sigils, 56 Dragon Bones\nStage 5: Hardest.\n27 Sigils, 96 Dragon Bones, 36 \nSigil Shop.\nFrom the Sigils obtained for completing the event, items can be purchased in the Sigil Shop.

We find great honor in this work, but great danger also. Never forget that &lt;a href=\"Namiira\"&gt;Namiira&lt;/a&gt; craves the hunter's heart above all others. An adept must find the seed of peace that hides within the bitter fruit of war."}
