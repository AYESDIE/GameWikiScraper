Walk over and talk to her.\nShe is surprised that a stranger had the strength to do what no one else could and free her from the dark shade. Tell her Leon sent them to do it. She loved him once, maybe still do but there is still one thing to deal with first and that is Molag Bal's deal with Leon. There are also the innocent spirits of Westtry and the angry spirits of the invaders to deal with.\nHere the Vestige must make a choice: Either choose the sword to make the town safe for mortals or use the gem to set the innocent spirits free.\nWhatever choice made, finish the task and then return to Leon and Rosalind's home and talk to Leon.

Muuu uhh, I wonder if this will really work?\n\"That mage took me for 25,000 gold crowns if it doesn't. Imagine? This stone will record my thoughts? What did they say? Just unwrap it from the silver foil and leather bag and as soon as it touches my flesh it will begin to record.\n\"Ahhhh, the pain, I must block it out, no one would want to hold my stone and hear my thoughts if I let it record my pain. Thank the training I received in &lt;a href=\"The%20Hall%20of%20the%20Virtues%20of%20War\"&gt;The Hall of the Virtues of War&lt;/a&gt;. I CAN block out this pain. Ummm just, ah, there, it's walled off.\n\"Yes, I can still see it there just beyond my consciousness lurking like a hungry wolf\u2014a wolf that will soon consume me. I see also my inevitable death from these damned wounds. No potions left, the healing crystal and ring are used up, and me, with not even magic enough to light a candle. Oh, but the gods did give me other gifts, the gift of &lt;a href=\"Sword-Singers\"&gt;sword singing&lt;/a&gt;, the thrill of battle, &lt;a href=\"Frandar%20Hunding%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Frandar Hunding&lt;/a&gt;'s &lt;a href=\"Book%20of%20Circles\"&gt;Book of Circles&lt;/a&gt;, THE WAY OF THE SWORD. Ah, but then, that is my story, I get ahead of myself.\n\"I am Makela Leki: a warrior, a sword-singer, a second level &lt;a href=\"Ansei\"&gt;Ansei&lt;/a&gt;. In my cradle I could form the &lt;a href=\"Shehai\"&gt;Shehai&lt;/a&gt;, the spirit sword\u2014the mystical blade, mine formed of pure thought serpents intertwined with vines of roses to form the blade, as beautiful as \u2026.\n\"Ah, but I'm about to tell you all about that, to tell you my story, a story of valiant battle, of my loves, of my wars, of betrayal and of this last glorious victory. To tell you of how I came to this distant lonely pass, me and five companions, to fight these men and monsters, to defeat the army that would fall on my people like cowards in the night \u2014 but again, I get ahead of myself.\n\"I am a simple warrior. I grew up as a Maiden of the Spirit Blade. As early as I can remember I wanted to be a &lt;a href=\"Sword-Singers\"&gt;Singer&lt;/a&gt;, to feel the hunger of the blade in my hands, to feel it come alive and take my enemies. I am told our people were artisans and poets long ago in our desert homes. Here in the new home now known as &lt;a href=\"Hammerfell%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Hammerfell&lt;/a&gt;, many of us have returned to those ancient ways, but to me there is but ONE WAY. THE WAY of the SWORD.\n\"Ah, this is hard to tell. I grew up in my noble family, the only one of three brothers and two sisters that felt the calling, the Song of the Sword. Father understood, for he too had felt the call. He had become a master and Ansei long before settling down at our estate to raise a family. At eleven, I entered the Hall of the Virtues of War and joined the &lt;a href=\"Maidens%20of%20the%20Spirit%20Sword\"&gt;Maidens of the Spirit Sword&lt;/a&gt;. In my band there were six of us. Daring Julia, solid Patia, big Kati, svelte Cegila, wise Zell, and me\u2014all are gone now, save me, and soon I will join them \u2026 join them in the halls of the unknown gods of war.\n\"We drank together, we fought, we wept, we grew in the way of the sword. We joined in our learnings in the Hall with our Brothers of the Blade. Learning from each other, we all sat at the feet of the Hall Master striving to learn the depths of the Shehai\u2014making the spirit blade into a real weapon as Frandar Hunding had. Only a few have the purity of heart and virtue to be able to take the step and learn the mysteries of Ansei. Sword Sainthood.\n\"Somehow, of all the Brothers and the Maidens, I only possessed the unique qualities, the faint but strong enough flicker of magicka to call forth the Shehai. Many times I called it, seldom would it become substantial enough to be a weapon. To be an Ansei of the first level you just need to be able to call it, and that I could, so I became the first Ansei from our local hall in two generations.\n\"Oh I have so much to tell, so many memories, so many treasures to share with you, my unknown companion. How do I start?\n\"Umhhh, the pain is still out there lurking hungrily, slowly consuming what's left of me. I guess I had better tell of the final battle, the one that has left me here, and then if I have the will left tell you of my life, of my love Raliph. Oh, what a lad he was. What times we shared \u2026 forgive me, my mind wanders \u2026 let me go to the Final Battle.\n\"Umm to start, in the middle humm. Yes. We Maidens grew, learned, and mastered the Way upon completing the Walkabout. To you who are not Singers, this is a wilderness trek emulating the times of Frandar Hunding\u2014where we each wander the countryside righting wrongs, defeating monsters, performing quests in the name of virtue. Some of us in our Hall took years to finish. Always there is danger\u2014we six Maidens each returned in our own good time, but many are they who do not live to return from the &lt;a href=\"Walkabout\"&gt;Walkabout&lt;/a&gt;.\n\"We returned, each to our own lives, to meet in the hall once a week to tell our stories to the new Maidens and Brothers, and to perform as instructors in the Way of the sword. All was well till the night of the &lt;a href=\"Midyear%20Festival\"&gt;Midyear Festival&lt;/a&gt;.\""}

It happened that the festival day fell on our day of meeting in the hall, our day of prayer and fasting and honor to the Way of the Sword.\n\"As we met, late into the night, a knocking rang on our door. When I opened it, there was a guardian from the &lt;a href=\"Bangkorai%20Pass\"&gt;Bangkorai Pass&lt;/a&gt;, wounded and near death \u2026 He told us of betrayal from the north, an invasion sponsored by High Rock, led by King &lt;a href=\"Joile\"&gt;Joile&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"Daggerfall%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Daggerfall&lt;/a&gt;\u2014our ally in the war with &lt;a href=\"Orsinium%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Orsinium&lt;/a&gt;!\n\"Quickly we used up a &lt;a href=\"Healing%20Crystal\"&gt;crystal of healing&lt;/a&gt; in restoring him to vitality. We sent him on to the king, while we six grabbed our weapons and armor of power, and as many potions, marks, and crystals and rings as we could carry.\n\"We flew to the pass hoping upon hope that we would not be too late. Our journey was not in vain, for we arrived just at the very point where the last three guardians were overwhelmed by the horde. Into the pass we ran forming the old battle line, six abreast.\n\"OH did we FIGHT.\n\"The Song of the Sword was a joyous noise slicing through the ranks of evil. We fought for hours. Julia was the first to fall, a cowardly poisoned dagger finding a rent in her armor. Then one by one all fell, save me.\n\"\u2026 Oh cruel fate \u2026 Then my beloved sword, the sword of my father, the one with the serpent's crest, fashioned by the master swordsmith Singer &lt;a href=\"Tansal\"&gt;Tansal&lt;/a&gt; broke in my hands. All was lost, our six lives spent in vain. Now, many many of them would pour through the pass. I would be easy prey for them, like a newborn child. I wept in frustration.\n\"Then I remembered the hearth in our home\u2014the book. &lt;a href=\"Frandar%20Hunding%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Frandar Hunding&lt;/a&gt;'s &lt;a href=\"Book%20of%20Circles\"&gt;Book of Circles&lt;/a&gt;, the Way of Strategy. I reached for &lt;a href=\"Shehai\"&gt;Shehai&lt;/a&gt;, the spirit sword, that which I could never reliably form when I needed it, and behold ... it was alive. Alive with fire. It formed in my hand. Ablaze with power\u2014oh, I slew mightily, right and left, like a scythe through wheat. All the way to the Lord of Daggerfall I fought. With one blow I cut his magical armor asunder, one more took his head.\n\"But to do that deed cost me dearly, wounds by the dozen, for although I had magical armor, it was not formed of spirit like my blade, it was not as invincible as my blade or my own spirit, and I was sorely wounded.\n\"With the felling of King Joile, his army crumbled. They fled before my wrath. All ran back through the pass not even pausing to collect their dead and wounded. All who could stand ran for their lives, and I slew all I could reach, but my breath was coming short, and the pain ...\n\"Finally I rested, on this rock where you find me now. I don't know why I chanced to bring this stone along. I bought it on a whim really, with the loot from \u2026 ah, well, I guess I need to really stop and tell my story in order. I feel able to go on to tell you more \u2026 the eternal night is descending more slowly than I thought.\n\"Not just yet am I ready to compose my death poem. A little sip of water and ... well, I think I will go back and tell you of my life, maybe some details about the battle. And, oh, yes. About Raliph and our children, humm where will I start.\n\"\u2026 Oh \u2026 rrr \u2026.\n\"I am \u2026 a simple warrior \u2026 I grew up as a, a Maiden of the Spirit Blade \u2026 As early \u2026 as early as I can \u2026 remember \u2026\""}

Because they are able to have children together, sometimes the races of men and &lt;a href=\"mer\"&gt;mer&lt;/a&gt; are both considered to be members of the human species, but at other times only men are considered human.\nMen are different culturally and physiologically from mer and &lt;a href=\"beastfolk\"&gt;beastfolk&lt;/a&gt;, yet they are genetically capable of interbreeding with the former, while rumors of interbreeding with the latter exist but are unproven.\nMen come in an array of skin tones and pigments depending upon their ancestry, with &lt;a href=\"Nords\"&gt;Nords&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Bretons\"&gt;Bretons&lt;/a&gt; being the palest and &lt;a href=\"Redguards\"&gt;Redguards&lt;/a&gt; being the darkest. There exist four dominant subraces of Men in Tamriel. These include, &lt;a href=\"Imperials\"&gt;Imperials&lt;/a&gt;, Nords, Bretons, and Redguards. The &lt;a href=\"Nede\"&gt;Nede&lt;/a&gt;s are an extinct race of Men from which the Imperials and Bretons arose.\nSeveral Men came from &lt;a href=\"Akavir\"&gt;Akavir&lt;/a&gt; during the reign of &lt;a href=\"Reman%20Cyrodiil\"&gt;Reman Cyrodiil&lt;/a&gt;. These Men formed The &lt;a href=\"Blades\"&gt;Blades&lt;/a&gt;. It is unknown whether Men still exist on the Akaviri continent.\nEtymology and usage.\nThe term \"Men\" originated from mannish language. It is used to mean \"them\" or \"us\" - group of people. The term is analogous to the word \"&lt;a href=\"Mer\"&gt;Mer&lt;/a&gt;\" in ancient &lt;a href=\"Aldmer\"&gt;Aldmer&lt;/a&gt;i tongue. Both of the racial groups have come to calling each other by the names and do not find it offensive in any way. They have been seen to be referring to their own kind by the term as well. This is probably due to the fact that both groups share certain distrust for each other and arrogance to consider themselves better. The words men and mer are often not capitalized when used together in the same context.\nMembers of this race who are of the masculine gender are referred to as \"men\", or a \"man\" when referring to an individual. As with mer, but more commonly as the words originate in &lt;a href=\"Tamrielic\"&gt;Tamrielic&lt;/a&gt;, those of the feminine gender are known as \"women\" collectively or a \"woman\" individually; when grouped together as a race irrespective of gender they are all called \"men\". \"Mankind\" is also a word used in the context of referring to the entire race.\nOrigins.\nMen are usually considered to have come from Atmora. The exception are Redguards or Yoku people, who came from &lt;a href=\"Yokuda\"&gt;Yokuda&lt;/a&gt;.\nEarliest records mentioning the races of Men date mid-&lt;a href=\"Merethic%20Era\"&gt;Merethic Era&lt;/a&gt; when &lt;a href=\"Atmorans\"&gt;Atmorans&lt;/a&gt;, a human race native to now frozen &lt;a href=\"Atmora\"&gt;Atmora&lt;/a&gt;, began migrating to northern Tamriel, a region later named &lt;a href=\"Skyrim\"&gt;Skyrim&lt;/a&gt;. Many Men now inhabiting Tamriel are known to be their descendants.\nHowever, when Atmorans began conquering Tamriel in Skyrim, they found Nedes and Bretons, the mannish races well assimilated in cultures dominated by elves. During the conquest of Tamriel by the people from Atmora, they came across other humans already inhabiting the whole continent, and it was a continent of mer ruling over men. \nThe early Tamrielic tribes of men may have been even earlier immigrants from at least Atmora if not other continents, looking for a new, better life.\nPhysiology.\nThe most significant difference among men and Mer is their lifespan. Unlike the centuries-old elves, Men usually live no more than one hundred years. The oldest (naturally) to be recorded was the Imperial &lt;a href=\"Sirollus%20Saccus\"&gt;Sirollus Saccus&lt;/a&gt;, who was over 274 years old during the events of . The oldest known living man however is &lt;a href=\"Miraak\"&gt;Miraak&lt;/a&gt;, who lived during the &lt;a href=\"Merethic%20Era\"&gt;Merethic Era&lt;/a&gt;, putting his lifespan well over 4500 years. His prolonged life can be attributed to &lt;a href=\"Hermaeus%20Mora\"&gt;Hermaeus Mora&lt;/a&gt; and/or him spending the majority of his life in &lt;a href=\"Apocrypha\"&gt;Apocrypha&lt;/a&gt;.\nMen and Mer also have various physical differences, as men are more muscular than most elves and have fewer shades of skin color. Another easily noticeable feature of elven kind is their pointy ears, which Men do not have. Most elves, including women, stand at twelve inches or more over most Men. Some exceptions to this rule are the &lt;a href=\"Orsimer\"&gt;Orsimer&lt;/a&gt;, who are very different from other elven races as they resemble other beast-like races such as &lt;a href=\"Goblin\"&gt;Goblin&lt;/a&gt;s, and the Bosmer (Wood Elves), who are shorter than most humans.\nBoth Men and Mer vary in terms of magical potency and attitude to magic. Among Men, Bretons have particular reputation as mages, while modern Nords usually dislike magic.\nModern Tamrielic races.\nNords.\nThe Nords are a tall and fair-haired people from Skyrim who are known for their incredible resistance to cold and even magical frost. They are enthusiastic warriors, and act as soldiers and mercenaries all over Tamriel. Eager to augment their martial skills beyond the traditional methods of Skyrim, they excel in all manner of warfare. They are direct descendants of Atmorans, who migrated to Tamriel in the time period known as &lt;a href=\"the%20Return\"&gt;the Return&lt;/a&gt;. They lead and crew the merchant fleets of many regions, and may be found all along Tamriel's coasts.\nImperials.\nNatives of the civilized, cosmopolitan province of Cyrodiil, the Imperials are well-educated and well-spoken. Imperials are also known for the discipline and training of their citizen armies. With this they were able to fight off the Redguard and control most of Tamriel. Imperials have proven to be shrewd diplomats and traders, and these traits, along with their remarkable skill and training as light infantry, have enabled them to subdue all the other nations and races, and to have erected the monument to peace and prosperity that comprises the glorious &lt;a href=\"Empires\"&gt;Empire&lt;/a&gt;. The Imperials control most ports in Tamriel.\nRedguards.\nRedguards hail from the province of &lt;a href=\"Hammerfell\"&gt;Hammerfell&lt;/a&gt;. They are a race that is known to be extremely quick and agile. They are excellent in all arts concerning blade and shield. They are descended from a long line of warriors and mystic seers.\nThe most naturally talented warriors in Tamriel, the dark-skinned, wiry haired Redguards of Hammerfell seem born to battle, though their pride and fierce independence of spirit makes them more suitable as scouts or skirmishers, or as free ranging heroes and adventurers, than as rank and file soldiers. In addition to their cultural affinities for many weapon and armor styles, Redguards are also blessed with hardy constitutions and quickness of foot.\nRedguards view use of magic unfavorably, particularly &lt;a href=\"Conjuration\"&gt;Conjuration&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Illusion\"&gt;Illusion&lt;/a&gt;, because of the ability to &lt;a href=\"Soul%20Trap\"&gt;Soul Trap&lt;/a&gt; and tamper with the minds of others. Generally, they consider wizards weak or cowardly. However, it is known that Redguards were fond of &lt;a href=\"Destruction\"&gt;Destruction&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"spells\"&gt;spells&lt;/a&gt; - suiting their warlike culture well.\nAlthough Redguards are Men, they do not share the same blood as Nords, Bretons, and Imperials because of their origin in &lt;a href=\"Yokuda\"&gt;Yokuda&lt;/a&gt;.\nBretons.\nBretons are Men with elven ancestry who hail from the province of &lt;a href=\"High%20Rock\"&gt;High Rock&lt;/a&gt;. Specifically, the Bretons have descended from the mannish people known as the Nedes and the ancient merish people known as the Aldmer. The Aldmer thought of making a superior race with their own \"Elder,\" or \"Superior,\" blood by mating with other races. The Bretons are sometimes called \"Manmeri\" because of this.\nThey are pure spell weavers and are advanced in all the arcane arts. While lacking in physical skill, they make up for it in their ability to resist and cast spells that overwhelm most people. They are united in culture and language, but are divided politically. Their origins can be traced to the &lt;a href=\"First%20Era\"&gt;First Era&lt;/a&gt; of Tamriel's history, when the Aldmer intermingled extensively with the Nedic people. This mostly happened during the period in the first Era when Mer held Men as slaves, which lead to masters impregnating their female captives. Bretons are of average height, and have either light or dark hair. They are highly intelligent, willful, and have an outgoing personality. It is said that Bretons are weaned on magic, for it seems to infuse their very being. Intermingling with Elven blood has given Bretons an affinity for magic, though hardiness is also part of their heritage. Breton culture operates under the feudal system, and their society is agrarian and hierarchical.\nAncient races.\nAtmorans.\nAtmorans, together with various Nedic tribes, were Humans native to the continent of Atmora far north of Tamriel. It is known that they resembled modern Nords, but were physically larger. \nEarly Atmorans had not developed a system of writing, and, as a result, little is known about their history. Earliest records of Atmorans date to the mid-Merethic Era when they first started migrating to Tamriel. Thier migration from Atmora was a process that lasted centuries and was taken by various malcontents, dissidents, rebels and landless younger sons. Skyrim was one of the lands, undergoing Human colonization.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Snow%20Elves\"&gt;Snow Elves&lt;/a&gt; in the area were concerned about the rapid population increase of humans and organized a slaughter in the event which had came to be known as the &lt;a href=\"Night%20of%20Tears\"&gt;Night of Tears&lt;/a&gt;. In retaliation, &lt;a href=\"Ysgramor\"&gt;Ysgramor&lt;/a&gt; gathered an army of &lt;a href=\"Five%20Hundred%20Companions\"&gt;Five Hundred Companions&lt;/a&gt; and mounted an assault against the Snow Elves. This event is known as &lt;a href=\"The%20Return\"&gt;The Return&lt;/a&gt;. After the Return, the last recorded \"invasion\" from Atmora was in the &lt;a href=\"1E%2068\"&gt;1E 68&lt;/a&gt; in the form of two ships begging to make port. Those who stayed are believed to have died when Atmora froze and changed beyond recognition. The Atmorans that left became modern Nords and Giants.\nNedes.\nThe Nedes were various tribes of Men originating in Atmora that were the ancient ancestors of the modern Bretons, Imperials and Reachfolk. They lived throughout Hammerfell, Skyrim, Morrowind and Cyrodiil.\nThe Nedes in Cyrodiil were slaves of the &lt;a href=\"Ayleid\"&gt;Ayleid&lt;/a&gt;s until &lt;a href=\"1E%20243\"&gt;1E 243&lt;/a&gt; when &lt;a href=\"Alessia\"&gt;St. Alessia&lt;/a&gt; created an uprising and freed them, creating the first Empire.\nThe Nedes were known to have had a race with the &lt;a href=\"Chimer\"&gt;Chimer&lt;/a&gt; and had eventually been confined to Hammerfell as they had died out everywhere else. Upon the arrival of the Redguards \u2013 the Ra Gada \u2013 they had been slaughtered and made extinct.\nOther races.\nKeptu.\nThe Keptu were one of the many breeds of men back in the First and Merethic Era. Very little is known about them.\nAkaviri.\nThe Akaviri were a race of men native to the mysterious continent of Akavir. Despite their involvement in many historical events, very little is known about them. They are believed to have had a distinct Oriental culture.\nSome stories tell that the Akaviri are now extinct, that they had been \"eaten\" by the native vampiric race of serpent-men known as &lt;a href=\"Tsaesci\"&gt;Tsaesci&lt;/a&gt;. Others believe that the Akaviri are actually Tsaesci and stories of serpent-men were simply fictional, the result of corruption over the years.\nThe last records of Akaviri/Tsaesci date back to the early First Era when they had tried to invade Tamriel, but were stopped by the army of Reman Cyrodiil.\nKothringi.\nA few books in the game spoke of the Kothringi, a race of men hailing from Black Marsh. They were said to look like men only with metallic silver-skin and had been quite common in the region during the &lt;a href=\"Second%20Era\"&gt;Second Era&lt;/a&gt;. They were eventually wiped out by the &lt;a href=\"Knahaten%20Flu\"&gt;Knahaten Flu&lt;/a&gt; before the start of the &lt;a href=\"Third%20Era\"&gt;Third Era&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe origin of the Kothringi is unknown. Some archeological discoveries suggest that the Kothringi were native to Tamriel, living as far as the early Merethic Era or earlier. However, other sources postulate that the Kothringi simply migrated to Black Marsh, willingly or not, and adapted to its environment, indicating a common origin with other Human tribes.\nOrma.\nThe Orma are a tribe native to Black Marsh dating back to the First Era. There exists an elevated occurrence of congenital blindness in the tribe, more specifically as a result of tribe members completely lacking eyes. Such individuals are said to be masters of their other senses. It is unknown how the Orma died out."}

The Covenant used a mysterious warrior known as the &lt;a href=\"Vestige\"&gt;Vestige&lt;/a&gt; to end the Supernal Dreamers and to carry out their sworn mission of uniting the provinces under a new empire. The Vestige traveled westwards to &lt;a href=\"Pariah%20Abbey\"&gt;Pariah Abbey&lt;/a&gt; to learn how to rebel against Vaermina's touch.\nA group of mercenaries known as the &lt;a href=\"Midnight%20Union\"&gt;Midnight Union&lt;/a&gt; raided the Abbey for an artifact known as the &lt;a href=\"Dream%20Shard\"&gt;Dream Shard&lt;/a&gt;. The Union pillaged the abbey and burned the fields surrounding it. Many monks perished in the flames while some died by Union's blade. The Vestige petered out the flames and fought the Union throughout the countryside. &lt;a href=\"Abbot%20Durak\"&gt;Abbot Durak&lt;/a&gt; was trying to find a way to defeat the Union and left himself in a deep sleep. The Vestige entered the &lt;a href=\"Dreamstride\"&gt;Dreamstride&lt;/a&gt; and drove the Union away. &lt;a href=\"High%20King%20Emeric%20%28Online%29\"&gt;High King Emeric of Cumberland&lt;/a&gt; took notice and had the &lt;a href=\"Lion%20Guard\"&gt;Lion Guard&lt;/a&gt; involved in the matter. Emeric went to the conclusion that &lt;a href=\"Count%20Hosni%20at-Tura\"&gt;Count Hosni at-Tura&lt;/a&gt; had something to do with.\nThe Omen of Blood; The Crime of Hosni At-Tura.\nCount Hosni at-Tura is a nobleman originally from the city of &lt;a href=\"Rihad\"&gt;Rihad&lt;/a&gt; that lives in Stormhaven to be a part of the Wayrest Court under Emeric. At-Tura is also the leader of his private militia known as the Midnight Union which has risen throughout Menevia. The Vestige traveled to his &lt;a href=\"At-Tura%20Estate\"&gt;estate&lt;/a&gt; on the southern shores to confront Hosni about the situation. It was revealed the Supernal Dreamers used the &lt;a href=\"Omen%20of%20Blood\"&gt;Omen of Blood&lt;/a&gt; to control Hosni and have him use the Union to attack Menevia. The Vestige defeated the Omen and saved Hosni. The traveler returned the Dream Shard and was sent to &lt;a href=\"Shinji%27s%20Scarp\"&gt;Shinji's Scarp&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Gavaudon\"&gt;Gavaudon&lt;/a&gt; to help the &lt;a href=\"Murtag%20Clan\"&gt;Murtag Clan&lt;/a&gt; fight the &lt;a href=\"Ironhand%20Ogres\"&gt;Ironhand Ogres&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe Lion's Endless Nightmare; Vaermina's Gambit.\nThe Supernal Dreamers had been eliminated on the peaks of the &lt;a href=\"Weeping%20Giant\"&gt;Weeping Giant&lt;/a&gt; in Gavaudon. &lt;a href=\"Azura\"&gt;Azura&lt;/a&gt; had answered the Abbey's as well as the Vestige's prayers and revealed Vaermina's plot. She planned to enter the dreams of &lt;a href=\"High%20King%20Emeric%20%28Online%29\"&gt;High King Emeric&lt;/a&gt; and to dismantle the Covenant for within his psyche. The Vestige entered the Dreamstride inside Castle Wayrest and traversed Emeric's twisted dreams resembling &lt;a href=\"Quagmire\"&gt;Quagmire&lt;/a&gt;. The Vestige defeated Vaermina and Emeric was saved. But a growing threat in &lt;a href=\"Rivenspire\"&gt;Rivenspire&lt;/a&gt; emerged, resulting in a civil war resembling &lt;a href=\"King%20Ranser%27s%20War\"&gt;King Ranser's War&lt;/a&gt;.\n&lt;a href=\"Third%20Era\"&gt;Third Era&lt;/a&gt;.\nMenevia in the Warp in the West.\nDuring the &lt;a href=\"Warp%20in%20the%20West\"&gt;Warp in the West&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"3E%20405\"&gt;3E 405&lt;/a&gt;, the Menevia county was independent of the other 23 kingdoms in the Iliac Bay. The city of &lt;a href=\"Wayrest\"&gt;Wayrest&lt;/a&gt; seceded from the Menevia county and formed the &lt;a href=\"Wayrest%20%28Daggerfall%29\"&gt;Wayrest&lt;/a&gt; Kingdom with the city being its capital. Later in the same year, Menevia annexed into the Wayrest Kingdom."}

She is known by the names Webspinner, Spinner, Spider, Androgyne, and Plot-Weaver, and her sphere is sometimes claimed to be lies, sex, murder, and secrets, but others claim her true sphere is obscure to mortals. She is worshiped by the Dunmer as one of the &lt;a href=\"New%20Temple\"&gt;Three Good Daedra&lt;/a&gt; in their pantheon. She enjoys seducing and interfering in mortal affairs, presumably for her own amusement, though others suspect her manipulations are for a greater purpose. Mephala is the ruler of the &lt;a href=\"Spiral%20Skein\"&gt;Spiral Skein&lt;/a&gt; and more obfuscated &lt;a href=\"Planes%20of%20Oblivion\"&gt;domains in Oblivion&lt;/a&gt; tied together by magical ghostweb. Mephala's minions are known as &lt;a href=\"Spider%20Daedra\"&gt;Spider Daedra&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Morag%20Tong\"&gt;Morag Tong&lt;/a&gt;, an assassins' guild in &lt;a href=\"Morrowind\"&gt;Morrowind&lt;/a&gt;, worship Mephala as their divine patron and founder. Some scholars have identified the &lt;a href=\"Night%20Mother\"&gt;Night Mother&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"the%20Dark%20Brotherhood\"&gt;the Dark Brotherhood&lt;/a&gt;, a rival cult of assassins, as a manifestation of Mephala, while other scholars dispute this assertion, or believe the connection is indirect.\nInvocation.\nThe summoning date of Mephala is the 13th of &lt;a href=\"Frostfall\"&gt;Frostfall&lt;/a&gt;. In , Mephala can also be summoned if the summoner offers &lt;a href=\"Nightshade\"&gt;Nightshade&lt;/a&gt; at &lt;a href=\"Mephala%27s%20Shrine\"&gt;her shrine&lt;/a&gt; between midnight and dawn.\nAndrogyny.\nLike all Daedric Princes, Mephala possesses no fixed gender. Unlike other princes however, she is called the \"Androgyne\" and as such is often perceived as having both male and female characteristics. In the \"Elder Scrolls\" games Mephala's sex is not obvious during game-play, though superficially speaking Mephala seems more womanlike in contrast to &lt;a href=\"Vivec\"&gt;Vivec&lt;/a&gt;, a being associated with Mephala but who seems more manlike; however, Vivec is seen by Dunmeri religion as ambiguous but defined in contrast to Mephala who is said to be \"manifold and androgynous.\"\nHistory.\nMephala is one of the three \"good\" &lt;a href=\"Daedra\"&gt;Daedra&lt;/a&gt; of the &lt;a href=\"Dunmer%20%28Morrowind%29\"&gt;Dunmer&lt;/a&gt;, alongside &lt;a href=\"Azura\"&gt;Azura&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Boethiah\"&gt;Boethiah&lt;/a&gt;. They were mostly worshipped by the Chimer prior to the apotheosis of the &lt;a href=\"Tribunal\"&gt;Tribunal&lt;/a&gt; and the subsequent transformation into the Dunmer. The Dunmeri Temple acknowledges them as the anticipations of the Tribunal. Azura is the anticipation of &lt;a href=\"Sotha%20Sil\"&gt;Sotha Sil&lt;/a&gt;, Boethiah is the anticipation of &lt;a href=\"Almalexia\"&gt;Almalexia&lt;/a&gt; and Mephala is the anticipation of &lt;a href=\"Vivec\"&gt;Vivec&lt;/a&gt;.\nMerethic Era.\nBack in the &lt;a href=\"Merethic%20Era\"&gt;Merethic Era&lt;/a&gt;, Boethiah \"illuminated\" the Prophet &lt;a href=\"Veloth\"&gt;Veloth&lt;/a&gt; and his Chimer followers to renounce all ties to the &lt;a href=\"Aldmer\"&gt;Aldmer&lt;/a&gt; and found a new nation based on Daedric principles, which came to be known as Morrowind. Azura taught the Chimer the mysteries needed to be different than the &lt;a href=\"Altmer\"&gt;Altmer&lt;/a&gt;. Mephala taught the Chimer the skills they would need to evade their enemies or to kill them with secret murder. Enemies were numerous in those days since the Chimer were a small faction. Mephala, along with Boethiah, organized the clan systems that eventually became the basis for the Great Houses of the Dunmer. Mephala created an assassins guild, the Morag Tong.\nThird Era.\nIn , it is revealed that there is a record of Mephala dealing with the Daedric Prince &lt;a href=\"Sanguine\"&gt;Sanguine&lt;/a&gt;. Mephala made a deal with Sanguine for twenty-seven tokens she could give to her devoted followers. The &lt;a href=\"Dark%20Brotherhood%20%28Tribunal%29\"&gt;Dark Brotherhood&lt;/a&gt; stole these tokens from the Morag Tong. According to a Morag Tong member, Mephala eventually arranged for them to return to the guild.\nDuring the quest \"&lt;a href=\"Threads%20of%20the%20Webspinner\"&gt;Threads of the Webspinner&lt;/a&gt;,\" the &lt;a href=\"Nerevarine\"&gt;Nerevarine&lt;/a&gt; systemically killed the members of the Dark Brotherhood one by one, including the Dark Brotherhood Night Mother in the ruin of &lt;a href=\"Ald%20Sotha%20%28Morrowind%29\"&gt;Ald Sotha&lt;/a&gt;, and retrieved the tokens.\nAnother interaction with the Prince in \"Morrowind\" happens during &lt;a href=\"Mephala%27s%20Quest\"&gt;her quest&lt;/a&gt;, in which the Nerevarine learns of and kills a rogue Morag Tong assassin called &lt;a href=\"Balyn%20Omavel\"&gt;Balyn Omavel&lt;/a&gt;, after which Mephala grants the Nerevarine the &lt;a href=\"Ring%20of%20Khajiit%20%28Morrowind%29\"&gt;Ring of Khajiit&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Hero%20of%20Kvatch\"&gt;Hero of Kvatch&lt;/a&gt; is also reported dealing with Mephala during the events of . She asked the Hero to go to the settlement of &lt;a href=\"Bleaker%27s%20Way%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;Bleaker's Way&lt;/a&gt;, which consisted of two families. She then ordered the Hero to kill the leaders of the two families, and leave evidence that the murders were done by the other family. Eventually this brought chaos to the peaceful settlement, and the members of the two families killed each other.

She told him secrets, including that he had a different mother than his siblings, that turned the boy against his father. When the &lt;a href=\"Last%20Dragonborn\"&gt;Last Dragonborn&lt;/a&gt; investigated rumours of trouble with the Jarl's children, Nelkir told them about the door and the \"Whispering Lady\" behind it.\nMephala spoke to the Dragonborn and directly revealed her identity, asking them to open the door to retrieve the blade. If they chose to do so, and used it to kill friendly individuals to restore is power, she would sometimes comment on the kills.\n&lt;a href=\"Elder%20Othreloth\"&gt;Elder Othreloth&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Raven%20Rock%20%28Dragonborn%29\"&gt;Raven Rock&lt;/a&gt; also Identified Mephala as one of &lt;a href=\"the%20Reclamations\"&gt;the Reclamations&lt;/a&gt;, the \"true\" Tribunal, alongside &lt;a href=\"Azura\"&gt;Azura&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Boethiah\"&gt;Boethiah&lt;/a&gt;.\nAffiliations.\nDaedric servants.\nAccording to \"&lt;a href=\"Darkest%20Darkness\"&gt;Darkest Darkness&lt;/a&gt;\", &lt;a href=\"Spider%20Daedra\"&gt;Spider Daedra&lt;/a&gt; are the servants of Mephala, taking the form of spider-humanoid centaurs, with a naked upper head, torso, and arms of human form, mounted on the eight legs and armored carapace of a giant spider. Unfortunately, these Daedra are so fierce and irrational that they cannot be trusted to heed the commands of the Spinner. As a consequence, few sorcerers are willing to either summon or bind such creatures in Morrowind. However, before the &lt;a href=\"Oblivion%20Crisis\"&gt;Oblivion Crisis&lt;/a&gt;, some conjurers had found a way to bind and summon this chaotic Daedra. These Daedra are also found in &lt;a href=\"Mehrunes%20Dagon\"&gt;Mehrunes Dagon&lt;/a&gt;'s &lt;a href=\"Deadlands\"&gt;Deadlands&lt;/a&gt; in .\nMorag Tong.\n&lt;a href=\"Artisa%20Arelas\"&gt;Artisa Arelas&lt;/a&gt;, a &lt;a href=\"Savant%20%28Morrowind%29\"&gt;Savant&lt;/a&gt; in Morrowind, explains: \"\"The Morag Tong is an assassins guild sanctioned by the &lt;a href=\"Septim%20Empire\"&gt;Empire&lt;/a&gt; to provide three varieties of execution: public executions, private executions, and House Wars executions. Constrained by ancient traditions and rigid codes of conduct, the Morag Tong only recruits candidates of proven skill and honor. Morag Tong only accepts legally approved contracts called \"writs,\" but rumor hints at the execution of secret extralegal \"grey writs.\" The Morag Tong is the sworn enemy of the Dark Brotherhood.\"\"\nSome members of the Morag Tong want to do more than religious assassination; they want profit. In an unknown year in the Second Era, another guild of assassins was established, the Dark Brotherhood. Morag Tong regards this new guild as a depraved perversion of the ancient law-abiding order of the Morag Tong. This makes the Dark Brotherhood the sworn enemy of the Morag Tong.\nAlthough it is said that the &lt;a href=\"Dark%20Brotherhood\"&gt;Dark Brotherhood&lt;/a&gt; values gold rather than religion, they religiously worship one primordial state of chaos, &lt;a href=\"Sithis\"&gt;Sithis&lt;/a&gt;. Sithis speaks only to the &lt;a href=\"Night%20Mother\"&gt;Night Mother&lt;/a&gt;, then the Night Mother brings the information (usually the murderous contract) to the &lt;a href=\"Listener\"&gt;Listener&lt;/a&gt;, and then to one of the &lt;a href=\"Speaker\"&gt;Speaker&lt;/a&gt;s, who then order the murderer, the lowest member of the Dark Brotherhood, to perform the killing.\nThere are many controversies about the entity called the Night Mother. &lt;a href=\"Carlovac%20Townway\"&gt;Carlovac Townway&lt;/a&gt; in his famous historical series \"&lt;a href=\"2920%2C%20The%20Last%20Year%20of%20the%20First%20Era\"&gt;2920, The Last Year of the First Era&lt;/a&gt;\", portrays the Night Mother as an attractive dark woman who leads the Morag Tong. This is disputed by Ynir Gorming in his book, \"&lt;a href=\"Fire%20and%20Darkness\"&gt;Fire and Darkness: The Brotherhoods of Death&lt;/a&gt;\". Gorming speculates that Night Mother is Mephala herself. There is another account by Enric Milnes titled \"&lt;a href=\"Sacred%20Witness\"&gt;Sacred Witness: A True History of the Night Mother&lt;/a&gt;\", which says that Night Mother is just an elder female mortal. This amount of contradictions leads to the conclusion that no one really knows who or what Mephala is, a fact that alludes to her sphere, being the Daedric Prince of lies and secrecy.\nAside from the &lt;a href=\"Black%20Hand\"&gt;Black Hand&lt;/a&gt;, Mephala is worshiped mostly by Morag Tong, while other worship to the Good Daedra ceased to exist in the Dunmer society.\nBy the &lt;a href=\"Fourth%20Era\"&gt;Fourth Era&lt;/a&gt;, following the eruption of the &lt;a href=\"Red%20Mountain\"&gt;Red Mountain&lt;/a&gt;, a new religious movement of the Dunmer people arose, dubbed the \"Reclamations\". This new doctrine declared the downfall of the &lt;a href=\"Tribunal\"&gt;Tribunal&lt;/a&gt; and the rise of their previously named Anticipations as the objects for worship. These Reclamations included &lt;a href=\"Azura\"&gt;Azura&lt;/a&gt;, Mephala, and &lt;a href=\"Boethiah\"&gt;Boethiah&lt;/a&gt;, who were \"reclaiming their status from the Tribunal.\"\nArtifacts.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Ebony%20Blade\"&gt;Ebony Blade&lt;/a&gt; was also awarded to the &lt;a href=\"Hero%20of%20Daggerfall\"&gt;Hero of Daggerfall&lt;/a&gt; sometime after the &lt;a href=\"War%20of%20Betony\"&gt;War of Betony&lt;/a&gt;. The blade was around since the time of the Eternal Champion. It is also believed that the Eternal Champion himself once wielded the blade.\nThe legend of the blade describes it as follows: \"The Ebony Blade, sometimes called the Vampire or the Leech, resembles an ebony katana, and its power is very dark indeed. Every time the Ebony Blade strikes an opponent, part of the damage inflicted flows into the wielder as raw power. The Blade itself may not be any more evil than those who have used it, but at some point in its history, a charm was cast on it so it would not remain with only one bladesman for too long. The wizard who cast this charm sought to save the souls of any too infatuated by the Blade, and perhaps he was right to do so.\"\nAnother artifact of Mephala was the &lt;a href=\"Ring%20of%20Khajiit\"&gt;Ring of Khajiit&lt;/a&gt;, though it was also associated with &lt;a href=\"Meridia\"&gt;Meridia&lt;/a&gt;. It was a sought after piece of equipment, especially by thieves for the sneaking bonuses it granted."}

Instead the shrine resembles an &lt;a href=\"Imperial%20Cult\"&gt;Imperial Cult&lt;/a&gt; Altar and (rather than being found in a &lt;a href=\"Daedric%20Ruins%20%28Morrowind%29\"&gt;Daedric Ruin&lt;/a&gt;) is hidden within the &lt;a href=\"Morag%20Tong%20%28Morrowind%29\"&gt;Morag Tong&lt;/a&gt; headquarters in the &lt;a href=\"Vivec%2C%20Arena%20Canton\"&gt;Arena Canton&lt;/a&gt; (within the Storage area of the &lt;a href=\"Arena%20Canalworks\"&gt;Canalworks&lt;/a&gt;).

Dral will give the Nerevarine the task of poisoning Omaven, using some &lt;a href=\"Treated%20Bittergreen%20Petals\"&gt;Treated Bittergreen Petals&lt;/a&gt;, to be placed in Omavel's food.\nRemoving a Free Agent.\nOmavel's house can be found in Balmora, just south of the eastern guard tower. Omavel can be seen patrolling the front of his house (he will look towards it frequently). To enter, the Nerevarine may use the trapdoor at the top of the property (without being spotted). Once inside, the Nerevarine must place the Treated Bittergreen Petals into the cauldron on the wall. Again the Nerevarine must remain undetected whilst they exit the house, before returning to Dral.\nDral, upon the Nerevarine's return, will instruct them to speak with Mephala through the Shrine. Mephala will thank the Nerevarine for their work and reward them with the &lt;a href=\"Ring%20of%20Khajiit%20%28Morrowind%29\"&gt;Ring of Khajiit&lt;/a&gt;, an artifact entwined with Mephala's powers. \u00a0"}

They are described as \"long-lived, culturally conservative humanoids\" whose societies feature stable social and cultural institutions.\nMultiple races of mer exist in Tamriel, including &lt;a href=\"Altmer\"&gt;Altmer&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Bosmer\"&gt;Bosmer&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Dunmer\"&gt;Dunmer&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Orsimer\"&gt;Orsimer&lt;/a&gt;, all descended from the &lt;a href=\"Aldmer\"&gt;Aldmer&lt;/a&gt;. There are a few other mer, such as the &lt;a href=\"Maormer\"&gt;Maormer&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Falmer\"&gt;Falmer&lt;/a&gt;, that are believed to be related to these races of mer as well. Some mer, such as the &lt;a href=\"Ayleid\"&gt;Ayleid&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"Chimer\"&gt;Chimer&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Dwemer\"&gt;Dwemer&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Snow%20Elves\"&gt;Snow Elves&lt;/a&gt; are believed to be extinct, or nearly so. The various races of mer have slight physical differences in skin tone, height, and other features, as well as greater differences in culture.\nEtymology and usage.\nThe term \"Mer\" can have one of two meanings:\nMer is the word used in the ancient &lt;a href=\"Aldmeri%20Language\"&gt;Aldmeri tongue&lt;/a&gt; to mean \"person\" or \"us.\" The term is analogous to the way humans use the word man. Speakers of the &lt;a href=\"Tamrielic\"&gt;Common tongue&lt;/a&gt; often substitute \"elf\" for \"mer,\" especially in adjective form. Most mer seem to accept \"elf\" as a suitable synonym, though they still usually refer to each other as \"mer.\"\nWhen referring to individual members of the elven races, \"mer\" can be both singular and plural. When used in combination with other words from the Aldmeri tongue, it simply means \"a type of people,\" and is translated into common as \"elf,\" or sometimes as \"folk\" (e.g., \"Changed Folk\").\nOrigins.\nMer generally believe themselves to be direct descendants of the &lt;a href=\"Aedra\"&gt;Aedra&lt;/a&gt;, having been tricked by &lt;a href=\"Lorkhan\"&gt;Lorkhan&lt;/a&gt; into giving up their immortality to create the world. Their opinions on their mortality differ from race to race, but none, save for the Dunmer, consider it a \"gift\" in the way humans do. Rather, opinions range from lamenting the loss of their birthright to enduring the suffering as a test of character.\nThe first mer came from the continent of &lt;a href=\"Aldmeris\"&gt;Aldmeris&lt;/a&gt;, arriving on Tamriel from the southwest during the Middle &lt;a href=\"Merethic%20Era\"&gt;Merethic Era&lt;/a&gt;. Though all modern-day mer descend from a single proto-race, they have diversified significantly in the thousands of years since the Mythic Era into various mer races.\nLifespan.\nWith the exception of Orcs (whose lifespans are similar to humans), Mer are capable of living for thousands of years, although few ever actually live that long due to disease and violence. The likely lifespan of an average mer is 200\u2013300 years, with 200 years being old and 300 years being very old. Altmer are far more resistant to disease than the other races of Tamriel, due to their sublime physical natures and often being gifted in the arcane arts. The Altmer were also taught how to naturally live another hundred years by &lt;a href=\"Phynaster\"&gt;Phynaster&lt;/a&gt;, the Hero-god of the &lt;a href=\"Summerset%20Isles\"&gt;Summerset Isles&lt;/a&gt;.At the time of the publication of the &lt;a href=\"Pocket%20Guide%20to%20the%20Empire%2C%20Third%20Edition\"&gt;Pocket Guide to the Empire, Third Edition&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"3E%20432\"&gt;3E 432&lt;/a&gt;, many living Altmer still remembered Tiber Septim's conquest of Summerset, thus putting them at an age of over 400 years. According to &lt;a href=\"Uupse%20Fyr%20%28Morrowind%29\"&gt;Uupse Fyr&lt;/a&gt;, there may be some Altmer/Aldmer on Summerset Isles who are over 4000 years old. &lt;a href=\"Nurelion\"&gt;Nurelion&lt;/a&gt;, an Altmer alchemist, was known to have died from old age.\nThe earliest mention of the Aldmer &lt;a href=\"Iachesis\"&gt;Iachesis&lt;/a&gt;, Rite Master of the &lt;a href=\"Psijic%20Order\"&gt;Psijics&lt;/a&gt;, is from &lt;a href=\"1E%2020\"&gt;1E 20&lt;/a&gt;, and the latest exact date with mention of Iachesis is &lt;a href=\"2E%20582\"&gt;2E 582&lt;/a&gt;, when the vestige meets him on &lt;a href=\"Artaeum\"&gt;Artaeum&lt;/a&gt;. This means that Iachesis is over 3500 years old as of the events of .\nAccording to &lt;a href=\"Alfe%20Fyr\"&gt;Alfe Fyr&lt;/a&gt;, the Dunmer &lt;a href=\"Divayth%20Fyr\"&gt;Divayth Fyr&lt;/a&gt; is a \"4000-year-old wizard.\" Uupse Fyr claims that \"he's probably the oldest and most powerful wizard alive. Not counting &lt;a href=\"lich\"&gt;lich&lt;/a&gt;es, or divine sorcerers like &lt;a href=\"Vivec\"&gt;Vivec&lt;/a&gt;.\" Divayth Fyr has likely extended his life for over 4000 years using magic. Similarly, &lt;a href=\"Yagrum%20Bagarn%20%28Morrowind%29\"&gt;Yagrum Bagarn&lt;/a&gt;, the last living &lt;a href=\"Dwemer\"&gt;Dwemer&lt;/a&gt;, is at least 3500 years old, being alive during the events of , and was evidently well into adulthood when the dwarves disappeared circa &lt;a href=\"Battle%20of%20Red%20Mountain\"&gt;1E 700&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe Orsimer mage and librarian, &lt;a href=\"Urag%20gro-Shub\"&gt;Urag gro-Shub&lt;/a&gt;, states that if he didn't take his work seriously, most books in &lt;a href=\"The%20Arcanaeum\"&gt;The Arcanaeum&lt;/a&gt; \"would've been burned to ashes or dissolved to nothing before the Third Era.\" This puts him at an age of over 600 years, if this sentence is not an exaggeration. This is far longer than a normal orc lifespan, which is closer to humans in length.\nThe Dunmeri Councilor of &lt;a href=\"Raven%20Rock%20%28Dragonborn%29\"&gt;Raven Rock&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Lleril%20Morvayn\"&gt;Lleril Morvayn&lt;/a&gt;, succeeded his mother as Councilor of the town in &lt;a href=\"4E%2065\"&gt;4E 65&lt;/a&gt;, and his rule continues to the present. If the Dunmeri aging process is relatable to that of Men, his complexion suggests that he is approximately of late-middle-age. His ascension was over 130 years prior to the events of , so a lower approximation of his age may be placed reasonably at 150\u2013160 years old.\n&lt;a href=\"Queen%20Mother%20Barenziah\"&gt;Queen Mother Barenziah&lt;/a&gt; in is approximately 432 years old, having been born in 2E 893. In comparison to humans, she looks to be in her late 60s, meaning she is in her elder years.\n&lt;a href=\"Knight-Paladin%20Gelebor\"&gt;Knight-Paladin Gelebor&lt;/a&gt; is a Snow Elf who has lived over 4,000 years. Whether this is from the natural lifespan of his subspecies, a direct life extension from Auri-El or a life extension done by his own knowledge is unknown. All other known Snow Elves are deceased so how long they may live cannot be determined.\n&lt;a href=\"Sondas%20Drenim\"&gt;Sondas Drenim&lt;/a&gt; is a miner in &lt;a href=\"Skyrim\"&gt;Skyrim&lt;/a&gt; who says he has been digging up ore for over a century.\nPhysiology.\nIt is very easy to tell mer from men based on appearance, as mer are less muscular than most men, but have a greater variety of skin tones. Another easily noticeable feature of mer is that they have pointy ears that men do not have (apart from the odd &lt;a href=\"Breton\"&gt;Breton&lt;/a&gt;, who only have very slightly pointed ears). Furthermore, most mer\u2014even females\u2014are taller than most men. However, there are exceptions to this, as the &lt;a href=\"Orsimer\"&gt;Orsimer&lt;/a&gt; are around the same size as men, and the &lt;a href=\"Bosmer\"&gt;Bosmer&lt;/a&gt; are shorter.\nMer are genetically capable of interbreeding with &lt;a href=\"men\"&gt;men&lt;/a&gt;. Rumors of interbreeding with &lt;a href=\"beastfolk\"&gt;beastfolk&lt;/a&gt; exist, but are unproven. Mer are also conditionally fertile, which means that they only conceive when population pressure is low, so expanding populations do not force them to explore or war with other neighbors. During the early adult years of &lt;a href=\"Barenziah\"&gt;Barenziah&lt;/a&gt;, the races of Mer were a lot less fertile than man and beastfolk, with female mer usually becoming fertile around 18\u201319 years of age.\nMer rely heavily on magical warfare, as they have a higher affinity for nature and magic, where Men tend to be less potent magically. The only exception to this, of course, are the Bretons, as they are believed to have been a mix of the &lt;a href=\"Aldmer\"&gt;Aldmer&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Nede\"&gt;Nede&lt;/a&gt;s.\nTamrielic elven races.\nMost of the present-day elves live on the continent of Tamriel. For the most part, these elven races have integrated successfully with the &lt;a href=\"Cyrodilic%20Empire\"&gt;Cyrodilic Empire&lt;/a&gt;, though some racial tension still exists in parts of the continent.\nAltmer.\nAltmer, in the ancient Aldmeri tongue, means \"High One\", though the Altmer themselves would say \"Cultured One\". They are a race that hails from the mysterious &lt;a href=\"Summerset%20Isle\"&gt;Summerset Isle&lt;/a&gt;. The Altmer consider themselves the most civilized people on Tamriel, a statement which is difficult to refute outright. Of the modern elven races, Altmer are likely the closest in appearance and behavior to the ancient Aldmer, due to a conscious effort of selective breeding. Of particular interest is the fact that two of the members of the Dunmer &lt;a href=\"Tribunal\"&gt;Tribunal&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Vivec\"&gt;Vivec&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Almalexia\"&gt;Almalexia&lt;/a&gt;, appear much more like Altmer than Dunmer. This likely means the Chimer resembled Altmer before the change, and these two were able to maintain that appearance through their stolen divine power. According to the \"Pocket Guide to the Empire, First Edition\", selective breeding and infanticide was practiced in order to help purify their race, though this information may be biased against Altmer.\nBosmer.\nBosmer translates most directly into &lt;a href=\"Imperial\"&gt;Imperial&lt;/a&gt; speech as Green or Forest Ones, though they are much more commonly called Wood Elves. As the name suggests, the Bosmer inhabit the wooded areas in southwest Tamriel, particularly the &lt;a href=\"Valenwood\"&gt;Valenwood&lt;/a&gt;. The Bosmer, as a group, are less haughty and cultured than Altmer, and more attuned to nature. They are particularly well-suited to hunting and ranging activities in the deep forests.\nDunmer.\nThe Dunmer, or Dark Elves, are a somewhat isolationist race of mer populating the northeast portion of the continent, &lt;a href=\"Morrowind\"&gt;Morrowind&lt;/a&gt;, and in particular the huge volcanic island of &lt;a href=\"Vvardenfell\"&gt;Vvardenfell&lt;/a&gt;. They are ancient enemies of the &lt;a href=\"Nords\"&gt;Nords&lt;/a&gt;, who often try to invade their homeland. Dunmer culture is quite different from that of other mer, most notably in their rejection of the &lt;a href=\"Aedra\"&gt;Aedra&lt;/a&gt; and worship of &lt;a href=\"Daedra\"&gt;Daedra&lt;/a&gt; or their living gods, the &lt;a href=\"Tribunal\"&gt;Tribunal&lt;/a&gt;. The word \"dark\" ostensibly describes the ash-colored skin, but can also be interpreted as gloomy or sinister.\nAccording to legend, the Dunmer are the remnants of the elven race the &lt;a href=\"Chimer\"&gt;Chimer&lt;/a&gt;, changed into Dunmer by the &lt;a href=\"Daedric%20Prince\"&gt;Daedric Prince&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Azura\"&gt;Azura&lt;/a&gt; as punishment for the crimes of their leaders. Dunmer culture is much more cutthroat and aggressive than that of other Tamrielic cultures. Slavery was legal until just a few years prior to the end of the Third Era, and there is still an active, legally-sanctioned assassins guild, the &lt;a href=\"Morag%20Tong\"&gt;Morag Tong&lt;/a&gt;, which is permitted to kill with impunity under certain circumstances.\nOrsimer.\nThe closest translation available for Orsimer is Orc (c.f. &lt;a href=\"Orsinium\"&gt;Orsinium&lt;/a&gt;, \"Orc-Town\"). The Orsimer, like the Dwemer and Chimer, were originally an offshoot of the Aldmer, who chiefly worshiped the Aedra &lt;a href=\"Trinimac\"&gt;Trinimac&lt;/a&gt;. When the Daedric Prince Boethiah was trying to convince the future Chimer to abandon their Aedra worship and follow him, he \"ate\" Trinimac (how figurative this was is up for debate), who had been trying to stop the Velothi from moving to Resdayn, and assumed his form. When he was finished, he left Trinimac behind, who then changed into a Daedric Prince, &lt;a href=\"Malacath\"&gt;Malacath&lt;/a&gt;. Trinimac's Orsimer followers were also changed, into the basic form seen today.\nThe Orcish culture and society revolve around tightly-knit tribes. Every Orc has a specific job and is obligated to perform it. Every man, woman, and child in the fort or &lt;a href=\"Orc%20Strongholds\"&gt;Stronghold&lt;/a&gt; is also trained from birth to defend it. Only the chiefs are allowed to have wives, and due to this, they often have several. This method is to ensure that the strongest Orc becomes chief, contributing his genes to the next generation of orcs who, in theory, should be stronger than the last. Orcs in strongholds follow their own law called \"The Code of Malacath.\" The will of Malacath is clarified by the stronghold's resident wise woman. The rules of the Code are simple: don't kill, don't steal, and don't attack people without reason. They do not have jails; instead, offenders are forced to pay a \"blood price\", in which the criminal bleeds until the victim is satisfied. In cases where the victim was murdered, the chief is consulted to convey an appropriate sentence.\nThe Orsimer, or Orcs, are far larger in size than any other mer ethnicity. Although shorter than the Altmer, the Orsimer have a heavier build and possess great upper-body strength. This results in a quite masculine, or even beast-like appearance. This is likely due to their brutish and savage warrior lifestyle, a result of the conditioning they put upon themselves to follow the ways of Malacath.\nOther Elven races.\nMaormer.\nThe Maormer, or Sea Elves, also known as Tropical Elves, are a race of exotic elves that inhabit the tropical land of &lt;a href=\"Pyandonea\"&gt;Pyandonea&lt;/a&gt;, a group of islands well to the south the Summerset Isles. The most recent ' debunks a commonly-made claim that the Maormer were evicted by the Altmer. Instead, they broke off from the ancient Aldmer when their immortal wizard-king, &lt;a href=\"Orgnum\"&gt;Orgnum&lt;/a&gt;, began a revolt. What little is known about the Maormer includes their strange skin, rumored to have chameleon-like properties, and their practice of a style of snake magic.\nAncient elven races.\nAldmer.\nThe Aldmer, or First Folk, were the ancestral Elven race, and are the direct descendants of the &lt;a href=\"Ehlnofey\"&gt;Ehlnofey&lt;/a&gt; (besides the &lt;a href=\"Hist\"&gt;Hist&lt;/a&gt;, the only ancient race of Nirn to survive its early days). Modern scholars believe that all of the Ehlnofey on Tamriel became the Aldmer, while those on the other three continents became men (&lt;a href=\"Atmorans\"&gt;Atmorans&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Yokuda\"&gt;Yokuda&lt;/a&gt;ns, and &lt;a href=\"Tsaesci\"&gt;Tsaesci&lt;/a&gt;).\nBy the time recorded history begins, the Aldmer had diverged into various other races. The Altmer are believed to be the closest to original Aldmer in look and behavior. The Daedric Princes occasionally interfered in Aldmeri life to create other derivatives (notably the Dunmer and Orcs). The term Aldmeri is sometimes used, incorrectly, to refer to all elves, especially by Imperial speakers who are unaware of the history of the race.\nAyleid.\nThe Ayleid, also known as the Wild Elves, or Heartland High Elves, were an offshoot of the Aldmer that inhabited the highlands of central Tamriel. They lived primarily in what is now northern &lt;a href=\"Cyrodiil\"&gt;Cyrodiil&lt;/a&gt;, during the Mythic and early First Eras. Much like the &lt;a href=\"Dwemer\"&gt;Dwemer&lt;/a&gt; in Morrowind, Ayleid culture is known primarily for the complex and intricate architecture they created, much of which still exists. Underground Ayleid ruins still contain remnants of their magic (including the increasingly rare &lt;a href=\"Varla%20Stone\"&gt;Varla Stone&lt;/a&gt;s), as well as the occasional artifacts. The Ayleid were also responsible for building the White Gold Tower, which today stands at the heart of the Imperial City. After a revolt by their human slaves approximately 200 years into the &lt;a href=\"First%20Era\"&gt;First Era&lt;/a&gt;, the bulk of the Ayleid were eventually driven south, to Valenwood, where they were assimilated into the Bosmer, or west, to High Rock and Hammerfell, where they either assimilated with the &lt;a href=\"Direnni%20Clan\"&gt;Direnni Clan&lt;/a&gt; or died out. While civilized mer claiming to be Ayleid still appear in Tamrielic history until well into the &lt;a href=\"Second%20Era\"&gt;Second Era&lt;/a&gt;, most scholars believe the race has either died out, or at best consists of scattered, primitive tribes hiding deep within the Cyrodilic forests.\nThe exact translation of \"Ayleid\" is not certain, as they spoke a language which has been mostly lost to history. A traditional Bosmer poem, \"&lt;a href=\"Meh%20Ayleidion\"&gt;Meh Ayleidion&lt;/a&gt;,\" means \"One Thousand Benefits of Hiding,\" so \"Ayleid\" may translate into \"Hidden Ones\".\nChimer.\nThe Chimer, or Changed Ones, were a splinter group of Aldmer who rejected almost all of the traditional religious teachings of their parent race. These mer instead chose to worship Daedric Princes, specifically Azura, Boethiah and Mephala, and place a much stronger emphasis on ancestor spirit worship. The three Daedra convinced the Chimer to reject Aedra worship as a lie, and look down on their Aldmeri brothers as weak. The Chimer were led, by a mer prophet named Veloth, from the &lt;a href=\"Summerset%20Isles\"&gt;Summerset Isles&lt;/a&gt; to the large island to the east of mainland Tamriel, which they initially named Veloth, but was soon known as &lt;a href=\"Resdayn\"&gt;Resdayn&lt;/a&gt;. The Chimer lived in Resdayn with another group of elves, the Dwemer, in alternating periods of peace and warfare, with both the Dwemer and the Nords to the north, until the middle of the First Era. At that point, a catastrophic battle between the two elvish races caused the entire Chimer race to change, into the modern day Dunmer, and their homeland became known as &lt;a href=\"Morrowind\"&gt;Morrowind&lt;/a&gt;.\nDwemer.\nThe Dwemer, which translates roughly as Deep Ones, were a scientifically advanced group of mer who rejected much of the traditional Aldmer teachings to emphasize science and mage-craft over god worship.Their name derives from their habit of building vast structures, both as dwellings and as workshops, deep in the mountains of &lt;a href=\"Vvardenfell\"&gt;Vvardenfell&lt;/a&gt;. The Dwemer, along with the Chimer, were traditional enemies of the Nords, and often were at odds with the Chimer themselves. At some point, possibly after their disappearance in &lt;a href=\"1E%20700\"&gt;1E 700&lt;/a&gt;, their name was corrupted in the Imperial speech into \"dwarf,\" although the Dwemer did not appear to resemble traditional dwarves in any meaningful way. They were basically the same size and shape as any other mer of the time, though unlike other mer, were often depicted with full beards. They are believed to be the only race of mer on Tamriel that did not descend from the original Aldmeri inhabitants, but instead branched off from the Aldmer before their arrival and immigrated to Tamriel independently.\nThe only known Dwemer still alive on Tamriel is &lt;a href=\"Yagrum%20Bagarn\"&gt;Yagrum Bagarn&lt;/a&gt;, and due to an infection with the deforming &lt;a href=\"corprus\"&gt;corprus&lt;/a&gt; disease, his current appearance is quite different from that of a healthy adult Dwemer. He did not disappear as he was in the realm of &lt;a href=\"Oblivion%20%28Realm%29\"&gt;Oblivion&lt;/a&gt; at the time.\nSnow Elves.\nThe Snow Elves were a race of Mer who inhabited &lt;a href=\"Skyrim\"&gt;Skyrim&lt;/a&gt; long before the &lt;a href=\"Nords\"&gt;Nords&lt;/a&gt;. It is commonly believed that centuries of underground living and &lt;a href=\"Dwemer\"&gt;Dwemer&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"slavery\"&gt;slavery&lt;/a&gt; twisted the race into the blind and merciless &lt;a href=\"Falmer\"&gt;Falmer&lt;/a&gt;. Amongst the few Snow Elf survivors, they prefer the name Snow Elf over their original name of Falmer, as it tends to refer to their now degenerated brethren, which the survivors call The Betrayed.\nThe surviving Snow Elves escaped the genocide bestowed on them by the &lt;a href=\"Nords\"&gt;Nords&lt;/a&gt; and Dwemer slavery by hiding in religious sanctuaries like the &lt;a href=\"Chantry%20of%20Auri-El\"&gt;Chantry&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"Auri-El\"&gt;Auri-El&lt;/a&gt;. There may be pockets of surviving Snow Elves left, though as of 4E 201 only one, &lt;a href=\"Knight-Paladin%20Gelebor\"&gt;Knight-Paladin Gelebor&lt;/a&gt;, is confirmed to still live.\nCantemiric Velothi.\nThe Cantemiric Velothi were a race of Mer that inhabited &lt;a href=\"Black%20Marsh\"&gt;Black Marsh&lt;/a&gt;. Not much is known about them at all. They are believed to be extinct due to the &lt;a href=\"Knahaten%20Flu\"&gt;Knahaten Flu&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"2E%20560\"&gt;2E 560&lt;/a&gt;.\nSinistral Elves.\nOnly briefly mentioned in a few in-game books, the left-handed mer or Sinistral Elves supposedly lived in the &lt;a href=\"Redguard\"&gt;Redguard&lt;/a&gt; homeland of &lt;a href=\"Yokuda\"&gt;Yokuda&lt;/a&gt;. It is implied they were entirely destroyed by the Redguards in a war between the two. The rest of them died with Yokuda.\nDerivative elven races.\nCertain races of people on Tamriel are indirectly descended from the elves, though they are not considered mer in the strictest sense.\nBreton.\nThe Bretons are a race of humans with elven ancestry, mostly through Nordic or Nedic concubines captured by the Aldmer during their conquest of Skyrim during the First Era. Originally termed Manmer by the Aldmer, they were treated as lower-class citizens until the Nords took control of Skyrim. At this point, the Manmer mingled in with the human population, and eventually migrated en masse to &lt;a href=\"High%20Rock\"&gt;High Rock&lt;/a&gt; to become Bretons. The Bretons are considered primarily human, but inherit the magical affinity of their elvish blood.\nTheir appearance looks mostly of man, but they do appear, on average, to have more angled cheek, jaw, and chin bones, not unlike the Altmer or Dunmer. They are slightly frailer in appearance than other \"men,\" if they can be considered as such, just like the elven races. However, it is unknown which genes are more prominent and dominant in the Breton people, whether it be mer or man, however, given the more man-like appearance of Bretons, with the fact that most of Tamriel's populace consider them men, would lead one to assume that Bretons are more man than mer. Historically, the man/mer hybrids that were the Bretons' ancestors mingled with the human population after the humans regained control of Skyrim, so one would suppose that they have more man than elven blood in them.\nFalmer.\nThe Falmer, known as the Betrayed by the few remaining &lt;a href=\"Snow%20Elves\"&gt;Snow Elves&lt;/a&gt;, are a race of Mer who have devolved into primitive creatures inhabiting the dark underground and remote areas of Skyrim. Centuries of life underground have caused the Falmer to adapt to their harsh environment. While physically similar to other Mer, the Falmer have changed noticeably. Their skin is a pale grayish tone and they move with a hunched posture.\nTheir most notable feature is their blindness; the Falmer have degenerated sight. However, their remaining senses have become extremely sharpened to compensate, and unwary adventurers learn quickly that the Falmer's blindness is no handicap in combat."}

Storm Atronachs are an amalgamation of stones, held together by powerful lightning. They are one of three main Atronachs used by &lt;a href=\"Conjuration\"&gt;Conjurers&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"Tamriel\"&gt;Tamriel&lt;/a&gt;.\nBiology.\nStorm Atronachs are tied to the &lt;a href=\"Realms%20of%20Oblivion\"&gt;Oblivion pocket realm&lt;/a&gt; of Levinace, which is supposedly a \"collective realm,\" one where it is an extension of their inhabitants, which is the case for &lt;a href=\"Infernace\"&gt;Infernace&lt;/a&gt;, the home of the &lt;a href=\"Flame%20Atronach\"&gt;Flame Atronach&lt;/a&gt;s. Storm Atronachs are beings of lightning, a combination of stones that are held together by lightning magic. Throughout the eras, the typical Storm Atronach takes on a hulking-human body, reminiscent of a Golem or a &lt;a href=\"Dwarven%20Centurion\"&gt;Dwarven Centurion&lt;/a&gt;. Storm Atronachs are a prime resource for Storm Elements (i.e., &lt;a href=\"Glint%20Splinter\"&gt;Glint Splinter&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"Shock%20Ball\"&gt;Shock Ball&lt;/a&gt;s, and &lt;a href=\"Skybolt\"&gt;Skybolt&lt;/a&gt;s). They are extracted from their remains, which nothing but a smoldering rubble of stones. Even then, Storm Elements are different depending on the source (i.e. &lt;a href=\"Wamasu\"&gt;Wamasu&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Thunderbug\"&gt;Thunderbug&lt;/a&gt;). But among the Storm Elements, the most well-known substance used from them are &lt;a href=\"Void%20Salts\"&gt;Void Salts&lt;/a&gt;. Gray-powdery salt that is primarily used in &lt;a href=\"Alchemy\"&gt;Alchemy&lt;/a&gt;. When attacked, Storm Atronachs emit electricity, such as when they shoot lightning in various directions or techniques like &lt;a href=\"Chain%20Lightning\"&gt;Chain Lightning&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Lightning%20Cloak\"&gt;Lightning Cloak&lt;/a&gt;. What is not commonly used by Conjurers is that Storm Atronachs, along with the other three main Elementals, can take various forms, such as a &lt;a href=\"Horse\"&gt;Horse&lt;/a&gt;, a &lt;a href=\"Guar\"&gt;Guar&lt;/a&gt;, or even a &lt;a href=\"Senche-Tiger\"&gt;Senche-Tiger&lt;/a&gt;. The person to bring Storm Atronachs into the world of Conjuration was &lt;a href=\"Corvus%20Direnni\"&gt;Corvus Direnni&lt;/a&gt; who applied the rules of &lt;a href=\"Koron%27s%20Peremptory%20Summons\"&gt;Koron's Peremptory Summons&lt;/a&gt; to Levinace and the Storm Atronachs, bringing them into the conventional form they are known for. However, one can alter the smallest detail of the summons to turn them into other forms."}

They can cast shock-based spells, such as a quick bolt of lightning, or a powerful storm blast that radiates from its body, electrocuting anyone nearby. However, they sometimes prefer to crush their foe with a powerful punch.\nStorm Atronachs also seem to reflect melee damage back at the attacker but not ranged spells or attacks, like bows and arrows. This is possibly due to the fact that hitting the atronach in melee would send the electricity in its body, down the length of the weapon, and into the &lt;a href=\"Hero%20of%20Kvatch\"&gt;Hero&lt;/a&gt; - whereas magic &amp; bows do not require direct contact with the atronach.\nLocations.\nThey can be found in the &lt;a href=\"Deadlands\"&gt;Deadlands&lt;/a&gt; (&lt;a href=\"Mehrunes%20Dagon\"&gt;Mehrunes Dagon&lt;/a&gt;'s &lt;a href=\"Plane%20of%20Oblivion\"&gt;Plane of Oblivion&lt;/a&gt;), &lt;a href=\"Coldharbour\"&gt;Coldharbour&lt;/a&gt; and in other Planes.

Summoned Storm Atronachs are brutally efficient against most Daedra, who are both vulnerable to electricity and tend to use it as a weapon themselves.

Although they have much more health than either the Flame or Frost Atronachs, they tend to keep their distance in fights. Their only melee attack is a slow, simple punch with their rocky fists, but they are also permanently surrounded by a &lt;a href=\"Lightning%20Cloak\"&gt;Lightning Cloak&lt;/a&gt; that deals shock damage to anyone nearby.\nStorm Atronachs are, naturally, completely immune to shock damage and have no weaknesses whatsoever.

The Stormcloaks, however, took this name with honor, since they see Ulfric as the rightful High King and exemplar of their Nordic values. They believe wearing his name would show the righteousness of their cause. However, the Legion also denies giving the Stormcloaks their name, the Legionnaires claim that Ulfric named them after himself due to his lust for power.\nBackground.\nThe Stormcloaks started when Ulfric Stormcloak and a militia group took &lt;a href=\"Markarth%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Markarth&lt;/a&gt; back from the native &lt;a href=\"Reachmen\"&gt;Reachmen&lt;/a&gt;, who would later call themselves the &lt;a href=\"Forsworn\"&gt;Forsworn&lt;/a&gt;. In return for their service to Markarth, Jarl &lt;a href=\"Hrolfdir\"&gt;Hrolfdir&lt;/a&gt; promised Ulfric and his men free\u00a0&lt;a href=\"Talos\"&gt;Talos&lt;/a&gt; worship in Markarth. When the &lt;a href=\"Imperial%20Legion%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Imperial Legion&lt;/a&gt; returned from the &lt;a href=\"Great%20War\"&gt;Great War&lt;/a&gt; to restore order, they were supposedly\u00a0refused entry into the\u00a0city until they\u00a0would also allow the free worship of Talos that was agreed upon between Hrolfdir and Ulfric. Due to there supposedly being chaotic violence occurring within Markarth under the militia's reign, an Imperial biased author claimed that the Imperial Legion was coerced to oblige. When the &lt;a href=\"Thalmor%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Thalmor&lt;/a&gt;, the enemies of the Empire in the &lt;a href=\"Great%20War\"&gt;Great War&lt;/a&gt;, found out, they demanded that Ulfric and his militia be incarcerated, or to enter another War with the Dominion. Because Ulfric and his followers were blatantly breaking the terms of the &lt;a href=\"White-Gold%20Concordat\"&gt;White-Gold Concordat&lt;/a&gt;, under the Empire's consent, the choice for the Imperials was clear, to avoid inciting another conflict with the Thalmor, the Imperials arrested Ulfric and his entire militia. This event is referred to as the &lt;a href=\"Markarth%20Incident\"&gt;Markarth Incident&lt;/a&gt; by the Stormcloaks. Ulfric claimed that the Markarth Incident showed the true immorality and weakness of the Empire, and was used to justify the Stormcloak rebellion. Ulfric was since also known as the Bear of Markarth.\nInteractions.\nStormcloak soldiers can be encountered throughout Skyrim. The Dragonborn can join the Stormcloaks and serve alongside them. The bulk of the Stormcloaks'\u00a0major operations involve invading and occupying keeps, towns, and cities that were previously held by the &lt;a href=\"Imperial%20Legion%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Imperial Legion&lt;/a&gt;.\nThey also maintain camps located throughout the Holds. Stormcloak Soldiers move in groups of three, moving between their camps. They may travel the roads if possible but in open terrain such as in the plains of Whiterun, they may instead opt to move across the wilderness. These small bands travel throughout Skyrim, and make an effort to avoid hostile settlements loyal to the Empire. When encountered in friendly holds such as &lt;a href=\"The%20Rift%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;the Rift&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"Eastmarch%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Eastmarch&lt;/a&gt;, they walk at a leisurely pace and offer polite instruction and greetings when approached.\nThey are more irritable when traveling in hostile holds, such as &lt;a href=\"Haafingar\"&gt;Haafingar&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"the%20Reach\"&gt;the Reach&lt;/a&gt;. There, they move at a quicker pace and warn approaching travelers away with weapons drawn.\nA single &lt;a href=\"Stormcloak%20Prisoner\"&gt;prisoner&lt;/a&gt; may be\u00a0&lt;a href=\"Random%20Encounters%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;occasionally seen&lt;/a&gt; being escorted by three Imperial Soldiers. The prisoner may be freed and/or armed. The Imperial captors consider this to be aggressive and respond with lethal force. The prisoner will attempt to make his way to Windhelm, and if he survives, will enter the city but will not appear inside.\nStormcloak Soldiers can be male or female, are always of &lt;a href=\"Nords%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Nordic&lt;/a&gt; ancestry, and are usually members of the &lt;a href=\"Character%20Classes%20%28Skyrim%29%23Soldier\"&gt;soldier&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"Character%20Classes%20%28Skyrim%29%23Warrior\"&gt;warrior&lt;/a&gt; class.\nApparel and weaponry.\nUnlike Imperial soldiers who are armed exclusively with &lt;a href=\"Imperial%20Sword\"&gt;Imperial swords&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Imperial%20Shield%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Imperial shields&lt;/a&gt;, Stormcloaks can be armed with a wide assortment of weapons, both &lt;a href=\"One-Handed%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;one-handed&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Two-Handed%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Two-Handed&lt;/a&gt;, which are typically made of &lt;a href=\"Steel%20Weapons%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;steel&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Iron%20Weapons%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;iron&lt;/a&gt;. Stormcloak Soldiers and Windhelm Guards wear a form of &lt;a href=\"Armor%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;armor&lt;/a&gt; equal in appearance to that of what\u00a0&lt;a href=\"Hold%20Guard\"&gt;Hold Guard&lt;/a&gt;s wear, but weaker, called a &lt;a href=\"Stormcloak%20Cuirass\"&gt;Stormcloak Cuirass&lt;/a&gt;. The shields that the Stormcloaks use may be made of &lt;a href=\"Steel%20Shield%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;steel&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"Hide%20Shield\"&gt;hide&lt;/a&gt;. As such, they are better armed but less armored than their Imperial counterparts who use &lt;a href=\"Imperial%20Light%20Armor\"&gt;Imperial light armor&lt;/a&gt;, which has identical stats to the armor Hold Guards wear, or &lt;a href=\"Imperial%20Armor%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Imperial heavy armor&lt;/a&gt;, which has the same stats as &lt;a href=\"Iron%20Armor%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;iron armor&lt;/a&gt;. The Stormcloaks are an offensive force of rebels, whereas the Imperials are trained to be defensive and coordinated.\nA Stormcloak soldier is the first enemy encountered in \"&lt;a href=\"Unbound\"&gt;Unbound&lt;/a&gt;,\" if &lt;a href=\"Hadvar\"&gt;Hadvar&lt;/a&gt; is sided with.\nDialogue.\n&lt;a href=\"Rescue%20from%20Fort%20Neugrad\"&gt;Rescue from Fort Neugrad&lt;/a&gt;.\n\"Hey!\"\n\"The guard has the key.\"\n\"Hurry!\"\n\"Get me out of here!\"\n\"You're gonna get me out of here?\"\n\"Thanks!

Led by &lt;a href=\"Ulfric%20Stormcloak%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Ulfric Stormcloak&lt;/a&gt; and based in &lt;a href=\"Windhelm%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Windhelm&lt;/a&gt;, they directly oppose the &lt;a href=\"Thalmor%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Thalmor&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Imperial%20Legion%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Imperial Legion&lt;/a&gt;. The &lt;a href=\"Last%20Dragonborn\"&gt;Dragonborn&lt;/a&gt; has the option of joining the Stormcloaks after &lt;a href=\"Alduin%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Alduin&lt;/a&gt;'s assault on &lt;a href=\"Helgen\"&gt;Helgen&lt;/a&gt;, regardless of whom the Dragonborn followed\u2014&lt;a href=\"Ralof\"&gt;Ralof&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"Hadvar\"&gt;Hadvar&lt;/a&gt;.\nName.\nThe name Stormcloak was first used to belittle the Stormcloaks' cause, though it has also been said that the Stormcloaks' name originated from Ulfric's desire for power. Whatever the case, they gladly accepted being named for Ulfric Stormcloak, whom they consider the true High King of Skyrim and an exemplar of their Nordic values.\nPhilosophy.\nThe Stormcloaks believe &lt;a href=\"Skyrim\"&gt;Skyrim&lt;/a&gt; should secede from what they feel is a corrupt crumbling &lt;a href=\"Third%20Empire\"&gt;Empire&lt;/a&gt;. This stance came about due to the aftermath of the &lt;a href=\"Great%20War\"&gt;Great War&lt;/a&gt; and the imposition of the &lt;a href=\"White-Gold%20Concordat\"&gt;White-Gold Concordat&lt;/a&gt; by the &lt;a href=\"Aldmeri%20Dominion%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Aldmeri Dominion&lt;/a&gt;. The Stormcloaks consider the Empire as just a puppet of the &lt;a href=\"Thalmor%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Thalmor&lt;/a&gt; because the Empire surrendered during the Great War and accepted the Dominion's terms of surrender. These terms ban the worship of &lt;a href=\"Talos\"&gt;Talos&lt;/a&gt;, which most Nords do not support. Many are outraged at this Talos ban and point out the &lt;a href=\"Markarth%20Incident\"&gt;Markarth Incident&lt;/a&gt;, as an example of the Empire publicly supporting the Dominion's oppressive influence over Skyrim. Furthermore, their opinion of the Empire is exacerbated with the arrival of the &lt;a href=\"Thalmor%20Justiciar\"&gt;Thalmor Justiciar&lt;/a&gt;s, who were allowed in when the Emperor was forced to crack down on Talos worshippers due to Ulfric and his supporters agitating about the ban.\nThe Stormcloaks believe they should not have to divert Skyrim's resources to rebuild a diminished Empire too weak to provide the functions of a just government and is under the Thalmor's thumb. Some think that the Empire is maintaining power in Skyrim by propping up loyalist &lt;a href=\"Jarl\"&gt;Jarl&lt;/a&gt;s. Many Stormcloaks have also begun to resent the imposition of what they believe are, Imperial-sanctioned &lt;a href=\"High%20King\"&gt;High King&lt;/a&gt;s, who can only act as figurehead puppets and not kings of merit. With so many grievances, the Stormcloaks have concluded that political independence is what's best for Skyrim, since it frees them from the Empire's detrimental policies and allows the natives of Skyrim to determine the fate of their homeland. Though there is much uncertainty that goes hand in hand with their revolutionary aspirations, the Stormcloaks believe that they will remedy Skyrim's wretched state and preserve their Nordic way of life.\nHistory.\nWhite-Gold Concordat.\nAmongst the terms of the Concordat was the outlawing of the worship of Talos, and, after the Markarth Incident, the Thalmor were given permission to enforce the ban. This angered many Nords, as Talos was highly revered among them and was considered to be their greatest leader, and that banning his worship was blasphemous.\nThe Markarth Incident.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Markarth%20Incident\"&gt;Markarth Incident&lt;/a&gt; is considered to be the initial conception of the &lt;a href=\"Stormcloak%20Rebellion\"&gt;Stormcloak Rebellion&lt;/a&gt;. In 4E 176, Ulfric Stormcloak and his army retook the city of &lt;a href=\"Markarth\"&gt;Markarth&lt;/a&gt; from the &lt;a href=\"Forsworn\"&gt;Forsworn&lt;/a&gt; invaders, under the agreement from the Jarl of Markarth that in exchange for Ulfric's military aid, Talos worship would be permitted in his city. However, shortly after retaking Markarth, the &lt;a href=\"Imperial%20Legion%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Imperial Legion&lt;/a&gt; returned to Skyrim in the aftermath of the Great War, but was pressured by Ulfric's militia to permit the free Talos worship in Markarth that was agreed upon by Ulfric and &lt;a href=\"Hrolfdir\"&gt;Markarth's Jarl&lt;/a&gt;. The Legion capitulated to Ulfric's demand initially, though soon after, the agreement was broken due to pressure from the Aldmeri Dominion, which had found out about the White-Gold Concordat violation and threatened to act if the Talos ban was not re-enforced. Thus, Ulfric and his militia were arrested and incarcerated. During Ulfric's imprisonment, his father, the Jarl of Windhelm, died, and Ulfric was forced to deliver the eulogy by a letter he had smuggled out of prison. Upon his release he returned to Windhelm, where he took up the duties of a Jarl.\nRebellion.\nThe event that escalated the unrest across Skyrim was the death of &lt;a href=\"High%20King%20Torygg\"&gt;High King Torygg&lt;/a&gt; at the hands of Ulfric Stormcloak in &lt;a href=\"Fourth%20Era\"&gt;4E 201&lt;/a&gt;. After years of brewing resentment for what he believed was betrayal by the Empire, Ulfric, now Jarl of &lt;a href=\"Eastmarch%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Eastmarch&lt;/a&gt;, challenged Torygg to a duel in order to take the throne.\nUlfric and his supporters claimed it was a formal duel in the \"Old Nord Way.\" Many others in Skyrim, such as &lt;a href=\"General%20Tullius%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;General Tullius&lt;/a&gt;, called it murder due to Ulfric's use of the &lt;a href=\"Thu%27um\"&gt;Thu'um&lt;/a&gt;, which gave Torygg no chance of victory. After Torygg's death, Ulfric fled to Windhelm, and Skyrim's &lt;a href=\"civil%20war\"&gt;civil war&lt;/a&gt; began. Using a combination of the outlawing of Talos worship and the Nords' strong sense of nationalism along with their mistrust of the Empire and the Aldmeri Dominion, Ulfric successfully recruited a great many of Skyrim's populace to the rebellion. All of the hold governments of the four &lt;a href=\"Old%20Holds\"&gt;Old Holds&lt;/a&gt; declared for Ulfric, as well as many wanderers, workers, sellswords, warriors, soldiers and former soldiers.\nWar tactics.\n&lt;a href=\"Stormcloak%20Soldier\"&gt;Stormcloak Soldier&lt;/a&gt;s fight using coordinated assaults, with its infantry members relying on their \"&lt;a href=\"Shield-Siblings\"&gt;Shield-Siblings&lt;/a&gt;\" to defend them as they attack. The Stormcloaks are known to use the shield wall formation, a tactic that has the soldiers stand shoulder to shoulder and form a \"wall of shields,\" holding their shields so that they abut or overlap. Each soldier benefits from the protection of their neighbors' shields as well as their own. The typical Stormcloak soldier uses a bow and arrow for ranged attacks, and a melee weapon with optionally a shield, while fighting in the frontlines. During sieges, they employ flaming catapults to whittle away at a city's ramparts and fortifications, while the infantry storms the gates and tears down the enemy barricades. The Stormcloak soldiers' faith in Talos and the righteousness of their cause motivates them to fight with both ferocity and courage.\nThey are mostly non-regimental, not relying entirely on rank as the Imperial Army does; instead relying on the talent of the Nord warriors in their midst to achieve their goals. The Stormcloaks theoretically have weaker defensive, but stronger offensive capabilities than the Legion; their use of armor is lighter and thus not as tough, but the Stormcloaks use a wider variety of weapons to make up for this. The Stormcloaks consider themselves more covert than Imperial Legionaries since Stormcloaks soldiers commonly say, \"Legion soldiers gleam like fresh fallen snow and clank like a kitchen.\" The Stormcloaks have sometimes employed covert ambushes, where they sneak onto higher ground and unleash a barrage of arrows on unsuspecting Legion soldiers. It is suggested through dialogue with &lt;a href=\"Irileth\"&gt;Irileth&lt;/a&gt;, that the Stormcloaks used assassins in an attempt to kill Jarl &lt;a href=\"Balgruuf%20the%20Greater\"&gt;Balgruuf the Greater&lt;/a&gt;. The Stormcloaks have also been known to plant false information in order to disorganize their enemies.\nArmor.\nStormcloak armor is basic &lt;a href=\"Light%20Armor%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;light armor&lt;/a&gt;. It is the same armor set worn by &lt;a href=\"Hold%20Guard\"&gt;Hold Guard&lt;/a&gt;s, but slightly weaker. There is also an officer version decorated with many unique bear parts and motifs, a nod to Ulfric's banner.\nInitiation.\nInvitation.\nRalof invites the Dragonborn to join the Stormcloaks if he or she followed him through Helgen Keep during Alduin's destruction of the settlement during the quest &lt;a href=\"Unbound\"&gt;Unbound&lt;/a&gt;. Likewise, randomly encountered soldiers might have also attempted to recruit the Dragonborn to their cause. &lt;a href=\"Farmer%20%28Skyrim%20Characters%29\"&gt;Farmers&lt;/a&gt; met on their way to Windhelm to join with Ulfric can also start the process.\nIntroductory mission.\nTo become a Stormcloak, the Dragonborn must venture to Windhelm, seat of Jarl Ulfric Stormcloak. There, his second-in-command\u2014&lt;a href=\"Galmar%20Stone-Fist\"&gt;Galmar Stone-Fist&lt;/a&gt;\u2014tests the Dragonborn to ensure both battle-worthiness and devotion to the Stormcloak cause. He asks the Dragonborn to travel to an island northeast of the &lt;a href=\"College%20of%20Winterhold%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;College of Winterhold&lt;/a&gt;, where &lt;a href=\"The%20Serpent%20Stone%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;The Serpent Stone&lt;/a&gt; is located, and slay an &lt;a href=\"Ice%20Wraith%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Ice Wraith&lt;/a&gt;. After doing so, the Dragonborn returns, where it is revealed that slaying the Wraith was as much a test of prowess in battle as it was a test of loyalty, because finding the island and killing an Ice Wraith residing on it is dangerous and difficult. As a new member, the Dragonborn receives the customary &lt;a href=\"Stormcloak%20Armor\"&gt;Stormcloak Armor&lt;/a&gt;.\nOnce the Dragonborn has joined the Stormcloaks, only one more opportunity remains to &lt;a href=\"The%20Jagged%20Crown%20%28Quest%29%23Optional%20betrayal%20-%20switching%20sides\"&gt;switch sides&lt;/a&gt;, leaving the Stormcloaks for the Legion. When the &lt;a href=\"The%20Jagged%20Crown%20%28Item%29\"&gt;Jagged Crown&lt;/a&gt; has been acquired, the Dragonborn can choose to travel to Solitude where they can give the crown to General Tullius instead. Tullius will then recognize them as an Imperial Soldier and immediately orders them to deliver an important message to Whiterun, while skipping the formalities of making the Dragonborn swear the &lt;a href=\"Imperial%20Legion%20%28Skyrim%29%23Oath\"&gt;Imperial Oath&lt;/a&gt;.\nOath.\nAll new initiates to the Stormcloaks must recite the Oath:\n&lt;poem&gt;\"I do swear my blood and\nhonor to the service of Ulfric Stormcloak\nJarl of Windhelm and true High King of Skyrim.\nAs Talos is my witness, may this oath bind me\nto death and beyond...\n...even to my lord as to my fellow brothers\nand sisters in arms.\nAll hail the Stormcloaks, the true sons\nand daughters of Skyrim!\" &lt;/poem&gt;\nTitles.\nThere are five titles that can be earned if the Stormcloaks are joined during the &lt;a href=\"Skyrim%20Civil%20War\"&gt;Civil War&lt;/a&gt; questline. Progress in rank occurs at the completion of key battles during the war.\nStormcloak camps.\nStormcloak camps serve as outposts for the Stormcloaks and are instrumental in the ongoing civil war. They are located in holds that are controlled by the Empire. If the Stormcloaks take over a hold, its camp in said hold will disappear, and vice versa. The exception is Eastmarch, which will not get a Stormcloak camp even if it falls to the Imperials.\nThey are commanded by a Stormcloak Officer who can be found in his tent, and also have a &lt;a href=\"Stormcloak%20Quartermaster\"&gt;Stormcloak Quartermaster&lt;/a&gt; working at a forge who will also serve as a merchant. The following is a list of every Stormcloak camp in Skyrim:\nPost Civil War.\nAfter the conclusion of the civil war in favor of the Stormcloaks, the player will be told there are still Imperial camps out there to destroy. However, when visiting said camps, the commanders will still be flagged as &lt;a href=\"Essential%20Characters%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;essential&lt;/a&gt; and cannot be killed. Furthermore the Imperial soldiers at these camps will eventually respawn if killed. Additionally, citizens will still mention the war. Although the Stormcloaks have won the war, Thalmor and Imperial soldiers can be still found with Stormcloak prisoners during &lt;a href=\"Random%20Encounters%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;random encounters&lt;/a&gt;.\nA number of notable changes occur after completing the Stormcloak campaign:"}

Stormhaven is essentially the epicenter of the northwestern world, branching all corners of High Rock, the Greater &lt;a href=\"Alik%27r\"&gt;Alik'r&lt;/a&gt; in the south, and even the &lt;a href=\"Western%20Reach\"&gt;Western Reach&lt;/a&gt; in the east.\nDescription.\nGeography.\n&lt;a href=\"Alcaire\"&gt;Alcaire&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe Fiefdom of Alcaire is situated in the western areas of Stormhaven, it is the second-most populated area in Stormhaven. Alcaire is home to various farmers and fishermen in Stormhaven, the lush, rolling hills dot the landscape, as the river runs down from the mountains and into the Iliac Bay. The settlement of Alcaire is situated on the highest hilltop, overlooking the area, as well as, bridging the way to &lt;a href=\"Rivenspire\"&gt;Rivenspire&lt;/a&gt; in the north. &lt;a href=\"Koeglin%20Village\"&gt;Koeglin Village&lt;/a&gt; in the south is a bustling fishing town, with a trademark lighthouse guiding the ships to Wayrest. West of the town is a path leading to &lt;a href=\"Glenumbra\"&gt;Glenumbra&lt;/a&gt;. The ruins of &lt;a href=\"Moravagarlis\"&gt;Moravagarlis&lt;/a&gt; has been occupied by the &lt;a href=\"Bonesnap%20Tribe\"&gt;Bonesnap Tribe&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"Goblin\"&gt;Goblin&lt;/a&gt;s, renaming it into the Bonesnap Ruins.\n&lt;a href=\"Gavaudon\"&gt;Gavaudon&lt;/a&gt;.\nGavaudon is the eastern hills of Stormhaven, with a small population when compared to Alcaire or Menevia. Seasoned farmers live out in Gavaudon because of the rich soil and open area that is located along the &lt;a href=\"Bjoulsae%20River\"&gt;Bjoulsae River&lt;/a&gt;. The township of &lt;a href=\"Wind%20Keep\"&gt;Wind Keep&lt;/a&gt; is situated on the western edge of Gavaudon, at the bottom of the &lt;a href=\"Cumberland%20Falls\"&gt;Cumberland Falls&lt;/a&gt;. Deep in the hills is the &lt;a href=\"Weeping%20Giant\"&gt;Weeping Giant&lt;/a&gt;, which is an ancient and rather large statue that overlooks the valley. During the reign of &lt;a href=\"Aphren%20Gardner\"&gt;Aphren Gardner&lt;/a&gt;, he took over an old fortress in the center of Gavaudon, which eventually fell into disrepair and became known as &lt;a href=\"Aphren%27s%20Hold\"&gt;Aphren's Hold&lt;/a&gt;. The road leads into the &lt;a href=\"Bangkorai\"&gt;Bangkorai&lt;/a&gt; region and &lt;a href=\"Evermore\"&gt;Evermore&lt;/a&gt;.\n&lt;a href=\"Menevia\"&gt;Menevia&lt;/a&gt;.\nMenevia is the heartlands of Stormhaven, housing the city-state of &lt;a href=\"Wayrest\"&gt;Wayrest&lt;/a&gt;, which is located along the southern coast. The lowlands in Menevia are humid, with most of Menevia's settlements resting on the coast near Wayrest. This area of Stormhaven has a large population of &lt;a href=\"Dreugh\"&gt;Dreugh&lt;/a&gt;s, creatures associated with the water. The Wayrest outskirts called &lt;a href=\"Dreughside\"&gt;Dreughside&lt;/a&gt; have been home to several Dreughs and even &lt;a href=\"Bretons\"&gt;Bretons&lt;/a&gt;. In the north is the &lt;a href=\"Pariah%20Abbey\"&gt;Pariah Abbey&lt;/a&gt;, which is a monastery dedicated to &lt;a href=\"Azura\"&gt;Azura&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"Daedric%20Prince\"&gt;Daedric Prince&lt;/a&gt; of Dusk &amp; Dawn. In the central road is &lt;a href=\"Cumberland%27s%20Watch\"&gt;Cumberland's Watch&lt;/a&gt;, named after the &lt;a href=\"Cumberland%20Dynasty\"&gt;Cumberland Dynasty&lt;/a&gt;.\nFauna.\nGoblins.\n&lt;a href=\"Goblin\"&gt;Goblin&lt;/a&gt;s are a common creature found throughout the provinces, and that is no different in Stormhaven. There are two well-known tribes in the region, the &lt;a href=\"Bonesnap%20Tribe\"&gt;Bonesnap Tribe&lt;/a&gt; in Alcaire and the &lt;a href=\"Stonechewer%20Tribe\"&gt;Stonechewer Tribe&lt;/a&gt; in Menevia. The Stonechewers live in the north-central hills of Menevia, near the fort of &lt;a href=\"Cumberland%27s%20Watch\"&gt;Cumberland's Watch&lt;/a&gt;. Unlike most tribes, the Stonechewers are more hospitable and less violent, capable of acknowledging an observer or an innocent bystander. Goblins are scavengers by heart, using crudely made weapons out of every part of an animal. Their clothing utilized feathers and bones. The Stonechewers and likely other Goblin tribes, worship a deity known as &lt;a href=\"Muluk\"&gt;Muluk&lt;/a&gt;, which is considered a variation of Malacath, the &lt;a href=\"Daedric%20Prince\"&gt;Daedric Prince&lt;/a&gt; of the Sworn Oath. They conduct rituals to Muluk every so often. Meanwhile, the Bonesnap Tribe is more of a typical Goblin tribe, though they manage to have a relationship with the &lt;a href=\"Ogre\"&gt;Ogre&lt;/a&gt;s of the land, living alongside them. Ogres do not typically live in the western hills; they are more known to live in areas such as Gavaudon towards the Western Reach. The Bonesnap Tribe are known to inhabit the ruins of &lt;a href=\"Moravagarlis\"&gt;Moravagarlis&lt;/a&gt;, which would become known as the Bonesnap Ruins.\nSpiders.\nThere are many dungeons throughout Stormhaven, and so the typical creatures can be found there, including the &lt;a href=\"Spiders\"&gt;Spiders&lt;/a&gt;. Spiders are found towards the region of &lt;a href=\"Rivenspire\"&gt;Rivenspire&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Wrothgar\"&gt;Wrothgar&lt;/a&gt;, where they are more prevalent in High Rock. Conclaves of Spiders live in Alcaire, in the ruins of Newgate, specifically the Black Widow variation, where they are entirely black with a red pattern throughout their body. While smaller spiders are harmless, larger spiders can spit chunks of webs and feast on dead creatures whenever they are in a rut. The largest of spiders are much taller and wider, capable of eating anyone whole. Their venom is a common type of poison in places such as Skyrim or High Rock since they are such a common creature found in the wild. Their eggs can be used in Alchemy.\nDreughs.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Dreugh\"&gt;Dreugh&lt;/a&gt;s of &lt;a href=\"Tamriel\"&gt;Tamriel&lt;/a&gt; are a peculiar creature with an interesting backstory that goes into the depths of &lt;a href=\"Mundus\"&gt;Mundus&lt;/a&gt;' greater history. Dreughs are aquatic &lt;a href=\"beastfolk\"&gt;beastfolk&lt;/a&gt; found throughout the northern waters of Tamriel, more so in the Iliac Bay and the province of &lt;a href=\"Morrowind\"&gt;Morrowind&lt;/a&gt;. They are large crustaceans that begin as a shrimp in the water, eventually growing into an adult, and undergoing a process where they are turned into land creatures. This process is known as &lt;a href=\"Karvinasim\"&gt;Karvinasim&lt;/a&gt;, and it can be considered a downgrade, considering their sudden decrease in intelligence from their sea form. According to legends in the Iliac Bay, Sea Dreughs were originally from an ancient pre-historic civilization, which is partially true. According to various myths, the Dreughs were a remnant of the previous &lt;a href=\"Kalpa\"&gt;Kalpa&lt;/a&gt;, which is an epoch of time. In this myth, Dreughs controlled the seas of &lt;a href=\"Lyg\"&gt;Lyg&lt;/a&gt;, under the control of &lt;a href=\"Molag%20Bal\"&gt;Molag Bal&lt;/a&gt;, or at least his form at the time. However, that Kalpa was destroyed by &lt;a href=\"Mehrunes%20Dagon\"&gt;Mehrunes Dagon&lt;/a&gt;. The modern-day Dreugh were considered remnants of this, denounced to the mere fauna of &lt;a href=\"Tamriel\"&gt;Tamriel&lt;/a&gt; in the current Kalpa. Dreughs can be very versatile, making them hunted in places such as Morrowind. This chitin can be made into Medium Armor, and their wax can be used to improve the same kind of armor. In Stormhaven, the Dreugh are found throughout the outskirts of Wayrest. The shantytown in Outer Wayrest is referred to as &lt;a href=\"Dreughside\"&gt;Dreughside&lt;/a&gt;, and it is here, the Dreughs of the wild occasionally harass the poorest of Bretons.\nWinged Twilights.\nThe lands of central High Rock, from the Sea of Ghosts to the Iliac Bay has a notable Daedric influence, with Stormhaven having a strong connection with &lt;a href=\"Azura\"&gt;Azura&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"Daedric%20Prince\"&gt;Daedric Prince&lt;/a&gt; of Dusk and Dawn. And so, the so-called \"Messengers of Azura\" are known to inhabit the land. The &lt;a href=\"Winged%20Twilight\"&gt;Winged Twilight&lt;/a&gt; can be seen as the &lt;a href=\"Daedric\"&gt;Daedric&lt;/a&gt; version of a Harpy. They are a female-formed creature with bat-like wings and scaly bodies reminiscent of &lt;a href=\"Oblivion\"&gt;Oblivion&lt;/a&gt;. Winged Twilight are found from Menevia to Gavaudon, more so the latter in the area known as the &lt;a href=\"Weeping%20Giant\"&gt;Weeping Giant&lt;/a&gt;, which contains a shrine of Azura. Winged Twilight have razor-sharp claws and are frankly intelligent enough to speak. These creatures are also known to share a relationship with &lt;a href=\"Molag%20Bal\"&gt;Molag Bal&lt;/a&gt;, with his daughter, &lt;a href=\"Molag%20Grunda\"&gt;Molag Grunda&lt;/a&gt; taking the form of a Winged Twilight.\nStorm Atronachs.\n&lt;a href=\"Atronach\"&gt;Atronach&lt;/a&gt;s, or more appropriately called, the Elemental Daedra, are a group of Daedra that are commonly used as servants for &lt;a href=\"Conjurer\"&gt;Conjurer&lt;/a&gt;s and other sorcerers. There are various types of Atronachs, some of which are artificially made while others are as natural as they come. Of the three main types, the &lt;a href=\"Storm%20Atronach\"&gt;Storm Atronach&lt;/a&gt; is the most prevalent of them to appear in Stormhaven. The name itself, \"Stormhaven\" is just for show. The region has the potential of being stormy and thunderous, with constant rain and such. Storm Atronachs can be found in the Gavaudon hills, but originally, the Storm Atronach hails from a realm of Oblivion called &lt;a href=\"Levinace\"&gt;Levinace&lt;/a&gt;, whose nature is currently unknown but considering its residents, one can assume. Storm Atronachs' forms can vary appear mainly as a large amalgamation of stones and lightning resembling a human; they can assume the form of &lt;a href=\"Camel\"&gt;Camel&lt;/a&gt;s or a &lt;a href=\"Senche\"&gt;Senche&lt;/a&gt;, though it takes a skilled summoner such as &lt;a href=\"Corvus%20Direnni\"&gt;Corvus Direnni&lt;/a&gt; to achieve this. In battle, Storm Atronachs utilize waves and outbursts of lightning to attack, as well as charging concentrated bolts of lightning towards opponents. Of the three main Atronachs, the Storm Atronach is the most powerful and most utilized.\nFlora.\nThe region of Stormhaven is lightly-forested if not at all. Most of the land is open grasslands stretching to the &lt;a href=\"Wrothgarian%20Mountains\"&gt;Wrothgarian Mountains&lt;/a&gt; to the Iliac Bay, this leaves the land open for farming and agriculture, as seen in Alcaire and Gavaudon. The land offers various water sources for the growing flora, such as the riverways of the Alcaire hills to the &lt;a href=\"Bjoulsae%20River\"&gt;Bjoulsae River&lt;/a&gt; along the eastern borders, not to mention the frequent rain that Stormhaven contracts. But overall, the land has sparse woodlands and open plains with trees coming in colors ranging from spring green to the summer yellow. Throughout plainlands grow flowers such as &lt;a href=\"Lavender\"&gt;Lavender&lt;/a&gt; and a &lt;a href=\"Lady%27s%20Smock\"&gt;Lady's Smock&lt;/a&gt;.\nGovernment.\nThe realms of the Iliac Bay are diverse and different, each with their own unique history, such as the province of High Rock itself. For the most part, there are eight separate kingdoms, with one of them being the city-state of Wayrest. Wayrest controls over the entirety of the Stormhaven region, from the mountain pass in the &lt;a href=\"King%27s%20Guard%20Mountains\"&gt;King's Guard Mountains&lt;/a&gt; to the riverbanks of the Bjoulsae. Though unlike the twenty or so nations in the Glenumbran West, Stormhaven has a total of five or six different nations, each with a deep, historical background in the area. Many powerful dynasties have ruled the Kingdom of Wayrest itself, each shifting the tides in the land, from the &lt;a href=\"Gardner%20Dynasty\"&gt;Gardner Dynasty&lt;/a&gt; that founded the city-state to the &lt;a href=\"Cumberland%20Dynasty\"&gt;Cumberland Dynasty&lt;/a&gt; that united ancient enemies to fight for a common goal, and to the &lt;a href=\"Septim%20Dynasty\"&gt;Septim Dynasty&lt;/a&gt;, who has interesting background in the Fiefdom of Alcaire. Other minor nations in Stormhaven include the Fiefdom as mentioned above, Alcaire, the &lt;a href=\"County%20of%20Menevia\"&gt;County of Menevia&lt;/a&gt;, and the &lt;a href=\"County%20of%20Wind%20Keep\"&gt;County of Wind Keep&lt;/a&gt;. Similar to a King, these regions are led by a ruler, with fiefdoms ruled by a Lord and counties ruled by Counts. Noble families have hailed from these lands, such as the mentioned Gardners and Cumberlands, but it includes the Bretons of &lt;a href=\"House%20Manteau\"&gt;House Manteau&lt;/a&gt;, who are expert tailors and ancestral rulers of &lt;a href=\"Wind%20Keep\"&gt;Wind Keep&lt;/a&gt;, and the Bretons of &lt;a href=\"House%20Dumontes\"&gt;House Dumontes&lt;/a&gt;, who has had a strong connection with the &lt;a href=\"High%20Elves\"&gt;High Elves&lt;/a&gt; of the &lt;a href=\"Direnni%20Clan\"&gt;Direnni Clan&lt;/a&gt;.\nReligion.\nThe various regions of the Iliac Bay each have temples dedicated to the &lt;a href=\"Nine%20Divines\"&gt;Nine Divines&lt;/a&gt;, per their association to the Empire of Cyrodiil. Unlike Glenumbra in the west, Stormhaven has a significantly less amount of political nations in the region, and so the religion in the area is not as divided. The Kingdom of Wayrest hosts the &lt;a href=\"Akatosh%20Chantry\"&gt;Akatosh Chantry&lt;/a&gt;, a group devoted to &lt;a href=\"Akatosh\"&gt;Akatosh&lt;/a&gt;, the God of Time and the Chief Deity of the Nine Divines. Akatosh is the leader of the Gods, taking various forms such as &lt;a href=\"Auri-El\"&gt;Auri-El&lt;/a&gt; to the Elves and Bormah to the &lt;a href=\"Dragons%20%28Lore%29\"&gt;Dragons&lt;/a&gt;. Akatosh was the one that had bestowed the gift of &lt;a href=\"Dragonborn\"&gt;Dragonborn&lt;/a&gt; to &lt;a href=\"Saint%20Alessia\"&gt;Saint Alessia&lt;/a&gt;, bringing about the &lt;a href=\"First%20Empire\"&gt;First Empire&lt;/a&gt; of Cyrodiil. The &lt;a href=\"Amulet%20of%20Kings\"&gt;Amulet of Kings&lt;/a&gt; is an Aedric artifact of Akatosh, and its sole purpose is to light the &lt;a href=\"Dragonfires\"&gt;Dragonfires&lt;/a&gt;, which creates the barrier between &lt;a href=\"Nirn\"&gt;Nirn&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Oblivion\"&gt;Oblivion&lt;/a&gt;. Wayrest is the High Rock capital of Akatosh worship, as well as the base of operations for the &lt;a href=\"Order%20of%20the%20Hour\"&gt;Order of the Hour&lt;/a&gt;, the militant arm of the chantry that enforces Akatosh's will. Other nations such as &lt;a href=\"Bergama\"&gt;Bergama&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Kvatch\"&gt;Kvatch&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Alinor\"&gt;Alinor&lt;/a&gt; (With Auri-El) have temples dedicated to Akatosh.\nBeyond Akatosh, the second most worshipped member of the Divines in the Iliac Bay is &lt;a href=\"Dibella\"&gt;Dibella&lt;/a&gt;, the Goddess of Beauty and Passion. She inspires creativity, teaching her followers the ways of beauty and worship. She is quite popular in the human pantheons, being seen as the Bed-Wife of &lt;a href=\"Shor\"&gt;Shor&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;a href=\"Nordic%20Pantheon\"&gt;Nordic Pantheon&lt;/a&gt;, as well as being highly regarded, taking the name of Dibe in the &lt;a href=\"Kothri%20Pantheon\"&gt;Kothri Pantheon&lt;/a&gt;, and subsequently in various settlements in &lt;a href=\"Black%20Marsh\"&gt;Black Marsh&lt;/a&gt;. The lands of Menevia and &lt;a href=\"Koegria\"&gt;Koegria&lt;/a&gt; worship Dibella. Beyond High Rock, the cities of &lt;a href=\"Tigonus\"&gt;Tigonus&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Anvil\"&gt;Anvil&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Markarth\"&gt;Markarth&lt;/a&gt; are known to worship the Goddess of Beauty. The only other divines revered in the Stormhaven area are &lt;a href=\"Kynareth\"&gt;Kynareth&lt;/a&gt; (Alcaire) and &lt;a href=\"Zenithar\"&gt;Zenithar&lt;/a&gt; (Gavaudon).\nHistory.\n&lt;a href=\"Merethic%20Era\"&gt;Merethic Era&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe Dragon Cult &amp; Zaan the Scalecaller.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Dragon%20Cult\"&gt;Dragon Cult&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"Skyrim\"&gt;Skyrim&lt;/a&gt; had been the leaders of their province for many years, having a wide scope of power, from &lt;a href=\"Solstheim\"&gt;Solstheim&lt;/a&gt; to Ancient High Rock. The Deepest into High Rock is &lt;a href=\"Scalecaller%20Peak\"&gt;Scalecaller Peak&lt;/a&gt;, which is a mountaintop in the &lt;a href=\"Wrothgarian%20Mountains\"&gt;Wrothgarian Mountains&lt;/a&gt;, between Stormhaven and Wrothgar. The leader of the Scalecaller temple was &lt;a href=\"Zaan%20the%20Scalecaller\"&gt;Zaan the Scalecaller&lt;/a&gt;, the only female &lt;a href=\"Dragon%20Priest\"&gt;Dragon Priest&lt;/a&gt; known in history, as well as, the youngest. During her time, Zaan led no battles and conquered no one; her life was unremarkable. Her &lt;a href=\"Dragons%20%28Lore%29\"&gt;Dragon Lord&lt;/a&gt; was &lt;a href=\"Thurvokun\"&gt;Thurvokun&lt;/a&gt;, who was neutral amidst the &lt;a href=\"Dragon%20War\"&gt;Dragon War&lt;/a&gt; and had a particularly strong connection with Zaan. But at one point, Thurvokun had left Scalecaller for unknown reasons, taking residents in &lt;a href=\"Arkngthamz-Phng\"&gt;Arkngthamz-Phng&lt;/a&gt;. Because of this, suspicion and doubt were prevalent in Zaan's temple, and depression had taken over Zaan, which eventually led to isolation. Zaan's disciples grew tiresome and eventually revolted. Zaan did not fight back, and she perished. What actually happened was after Thurvokun left, Zaan took to worshipping &lt;a href=\"Peryite\"&gt;Peryite&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"Daedric%20Prince\"&gt;Daedric Prince&lt;/a&gt; of Pestilence. She did not die, she fell into a slumber, gaining access to &lt;a href=\"Spellbreaker\"&gt;Spellbreaker&lt;/a&gt; and waiting to be awakened by her new master and his followers.\n&lt;a href=\"First%20Era\"&gt;First Era&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe Bjoulsae Raids &amp; the Kingdom of Wayrest.\nThroughout the First Era, the province of High Rock was seldom in Breton settlements, with the most prevalent hamlet found along the &lt;a href=\"Sea%20of%20Ghosts\"&gt;Sea of Ghosts&lt;/a&gt; and the western Iliac (i.e. &lt;a href=\"Daggerfall\"&gt;Daggerfall&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Reich%20Gradkeep\"&gt;Reich Gradkeep&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Shornhelm\"&gt;Shornhelm&lt;/a&gt;). Along the &lt;a href=\"Bjoulsae%20River\"&gt;Bjoulsae River&lt;/a&gt; were simple fishing villages and the &lt;a href=\"River%20Horse%20Bretons\"&gt;River Horse Bretons&lt;/a&gt;, tribes of Bretons. One of these sleeping villages was &lt;a href=\"Wayrest\"&gt;Wayrest&lt;/a&gt;, a welcome rest in the eastern Iliac. But through its time, Wayrest would be harassed by the &lt;a href=\"Akaviri\"&gt;Akaviri&lt;/a&gt; pirates or the &lt;a href=\"Orsimer\"&gt;Orsimer&lt;/a&gt; of the Western Reach. One such attack caused by the Orcs of the &lt;a href=\"Bagrakh%20Clan\"&gt;Bagrakh Clan&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Igrun%20Clan\"&gt;Igrun Clan&lt;/a&gt; was considered the last straw for High Rock. These attacks were the &lt;a href=\"Bjoulsae%20Raids\"&gt;Bjoulsae Raids&lt;/a&gt;, and it prompted &lt;a href=\"King%20Joile\"&gt;King Joile&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"Daggerfall\"&gt;Daggerfall&lt;/a&gt; to take action, seeking an allegiance with &lt;a href=\"Gaiden%20Shinji\"&gt;Gaiden Shinji&lt;/a&gt; of the &lt;a href=\"Order%20of%20Diagna\"&gt;Order of Diagna&lt;/a&gt;. In &lt;a href=\"1E%20950\"&gt;1E 950&lt;/a&gt;, the Kingdoms of High Rock and Sentinel invaded the prosperous &lt;a href=\"Kingdom%20of%20Orsinium\"&gt;Kingdom of Orsinium&lt;/a&gt;, beginning the thirty-year long &lt;a href=\"Siege%20of%20Orsinium\"&gt;Siege of Orsinium&lt;/a&gt;. As time went on, Orsinium had fallen in &lt;a href=\"1E%20980\"&gt;1E 980&lt;/a&gt;, with the death of &lt;a href=\"Golkarr%20gro-Igrun\"&gt;Golkarr gro-Igrun&lt;/a&gt;, King of Orsinium. The destruction of Orsinium had paved the way for brighter future in Wayrest. The merchants and builders of Wayrest were instrumental with the founding of the &lt;a href=\"Masconian%20Trade%20Way\"&gt;Masconian Trade Way&lt;/a&gt;, which connected the township to Daggerfall and Sentinel. With the new power, the trading family of &lt;a href=\"House%20Gardner\"&gt;House Gardner&lt;/a&gt; established a walled-off Castle which became &lt;a href=\"Castle%20Wayrest\"&gt;Castle Wayrest&lt;/a&gt;, with Wayrest growing around it. Under the leadership of &lt;a href=\"Farangel%20Gardner\"&gt;Farangel Gardner&lt;/a&gt;, Wayrest was proclaimed a Kingdom by ambassadors of the &lt;a href=\"Camoran%20Dynasty\"&gt;Camoran Dynasty&lt;/a&gt;, with Farangel as their first King. Thus came the &lt;a href=\"Gardner%20Dynasty\"&gt;Gardner Dynasty&lt;/a&gt;.\nAzura's Benevolence; Enter the Spirit Wardens.\nWith the destruction of Orsinium, the &lt;a href=\"Orsimer\"&gt;Orsimer&lt;/a&gt; of Wrothgar have fled to all corners of the Greater Reach, from &lt;a href=\"Western%20Falkreath\"&gt;Western Falkreath&lt;/a&gt; to the mountains of &lt;a href=\"Craglorn\"&gt;Craglorn&lt;/a&gt;. One such refugee of Orsinium was &lt;a href=\"Abbot%20Durak\"&gt;Durak&lt;/a&gt;, who was raised in Orsinium and lived with brothers, who bullied him. Durak was smaller than a typical Orc, subjugated to bullying from his peers. On one fateful day, Durak received whispers from &lt;a href=\"Azura\"&gt;Azura&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"Daedric%20Prince\"&gt;Daedric Prince&lt;/a&gt; of Dusk and Dawn. Azura told him that he would accomplish a great task by founding a priesthood and saving Stormhaven from a threat of nightmares, these \"Spirit Wardens\" would remain in Stormhaven, awaiting such a threat. After the Siege of Orsinium had ended, Durak fled traveled to Stormhaven and the &lt;a href=\"Gavaudon\"&gt;Gavaudon&lt;/a&gt; region, where he took refuge at the &lt;a href=\"Weeping%20Giant\"&gt;Weeping Giant&lt;/a&gt;. It was there, Azura appeared before him with whispers of hills hidden in the &lt;a href=\"Fiefdom%20of%20Menevia\"&gt;Fiefdom of Menevia&lt;/a&gt;. Durak traveled there and found an ancient abbey, which he re-created it and used it as a Temple of Azura. Eventually, Durak had founded the &lt;a href=\"Spirit%20Wardens\"&gt;Spirit Wardens&lt;/a&gt;, remaining in &lt;a href=\"Pariah%20Abbey\"&gt;Pariah Abbey&lt;/a&gt; for many years, awaiting a threat that would plague Stormhaven.\n&lt;a href=\"Second%20Era\"&gt;Second Era&lt;/a&gt;.\nLegend of Sir Byric of the Flame.\nDuring the earliest years of the First Era, the &lt;a href=\"Nords\"&gt;Nords&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"Skyrim\"&gt;Skyrim&lt;/a&gt;, under the reign of &lt;a href=\"Vrage%20the%20Gifted\"&gt;Vrage the Gifted&lt;/a&gt;, had conquered a large portion of northern Tamriel. This territory ranged from modern-day Daggerfall, to as far as &lt;a href=\"Ebonheart\"&gt;Ebonheart&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Morrowind\"&gt;Morrowind&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Nibenay\"&gt;Nibenay&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Cyrodiil\"&gt;Cyrodiil&lt;/a&gt;. But with the &lt;a href=\"War%20of%20Succession\"&gt;War of Succession&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"Direnni%20Hegemony\"&gt;Direnni Hegemony&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"Balfiera\"&gt;Balfiera&lt;/a&gt; had pushed the Nordic forces back into their homeland, and taking control of High Rock for themselves. But as time went on, the Direnni had lost their power, remaining on Balfiera for the rest of their days. What led the forefront against the Direnni was the establishment of Knightly Orders, and one such Knightly Order was the &lt;a href=\"Alcaire%20Knights\"&gt;Alcaire Knights&lt;/a&gt;, a group originating from the Fiefdom of Alcaire. These Knights have protected the land for several years, and eventually, the &lt;a href=\"Fiefdom%20of%20Anticlere\"&gt;Fiefdom of Anticlere&lt;/a&gt;. But the Knights would later become a standing power amidst Stormhaven. In &lt;a href=\"2E%20542\"&gt;2E 542&lt;/a&gt;, invaders of the &lt;a href=\"Western%20Reach\"&gt;Western Reach&lt;/a&gt; had attacked Alcaire Castle, with overwhelming power that prompted &lt;a href=\"Sir%20Byric\"&gt;Sir Byric&lt;/a&gt; to take action. To defeat the &lt;a href=\"Reachmen\"&gt;Reachmen&lt;/a&gt;, Byric sets the entire field on fire, which forced the Reachmen to flee back into the mountains. Alcaire was saved an in his honor, a statue was erected and the Alcaire Knights were renamed to the &lt;a href=\"Knights%20of%20the%20Flame\"&gt;Knights of the Flame&lt;/a&gt;.\nDurcorach the Black Drake &amp; the Daggerfall Covenant.\nEver since Wayrest ascended to the status of Kingdom, the Gardner Dynasty ruled the south-central coast of the Iliac Bay, beginning with Farangel Gardner. As time went on, Farangel passed away, and it went to &lt;a href=\"Aphren%20Gardner\"&gt;Aphren Gardner&lt;/a&gt;, and so on. In &lt;a href=\"2E%20542\"&gt;2E 542&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Durcorach%20the%20Black%20Drake\"&gt;Durcorach the Black Drake&lt;/a&gt; had descended into High Rock, with a horde of &lt;a href=\"Reachmen\"&gt;Reachmen&lt;/a&gt;. Within a week or so, the region of Bangkorai was conquered by Durcorach, leaving Wayrest open. When news of this had reached Stormhaven, people from all over, ranging from Alcaire to Gavaudon fled to Wayrest, taking shelter within the walls. King Gardner led the defense, along with help of the Bretons of &lt;a href=\"House%20Cumberland\"&gt;House Cumberland&lt;/a&gt;. Thus began the &lt;a href=\"Siege%20of%20Wayrest%20%282E%20542%29\"&gt;Siege of Wayrest&lt;/a&gt;, which lasted for fifty-seven days, with the Reachmen attempting to break down the walls. Fortunately, the Reachmen did not have &lt;a href=\"Siege%20Weapons\"&gt;Siege Weapons&lt;/a&gt;, nor any ships to attack the ports, so their assault was not as bad. Eventually, they gave up and traveled south, taking over &lt;a href=\"Camlorn\"&gt;Camlorn&lt;/a&gt; and setting their sights to the &lt;a href=\"Kingdom%20of%20Daggerfall\"&gt;Kingdom of Daggerfall&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href=\"Emeric%20of%20Cumberland\"&gt;Emeric of Cumberland&lt;/a&gt; had followed suit with an armada of Wayrest warriors, including the &lt;a href=\"Menevia%20Heavy%20Dragoons\"&gt;Menevia Heavy Dragoons&lt;/a&gt;. As the Reachmen was breaking down the walls of Daggerfall, Emeric had cornered them from the east, with Daggerfall under &lt;a href=\"Bergamot%20Deleyn\"&gt;Bergamot Deleyn&lt;/a&gt; helping in their counterattack. In the end, Emeric had slain Durcorach, ending his tirade over High Rock. Afterward, the Kings of High Rock gathered together to establish the &lt;a href=\"Daggerfall%20Covenant\"&gt;Daggerfall Covenant&lt;/a&gt;, an alliance consisting of the Kings of High Rock, banding together to attack foreign invaders. Wayrest and Stormhaven had joined the Covenant.\nHigh King Emeric &amp; King Ranser's War.\nWayrest had flourished with the foundation of the Daggerfall Covenant, especially in &lt;a href=\"2E%20561\"&gt;2E 561&lt;/a&gt; when Earl Emeric had discovered the largest deposit of Orichalcum in history, to which he used to improve Wayrest's fleet and trading, to the joy of &lt;a href=\"King%20Gardner\"&gt;King Gardner&lt;/a&gt;. But unfortunately, the &lt;a href=\"Knahaten%20Flu\"&gt;Knahaten Flu&lt;/a&gt; arrives, sweeping over the province of High Rock, ending the Gardner Dynasty for good. Because of this and his famous exploits, Emeric of Cumberland was promoted to the King of High Rock, and by extension, the High King of the province. High Rock was able to overcome the Flu, and so Emeric sought someone's hand in marriage. At first, Emeric went for &lt;a href=\"Rayelle\"&gt;Rayelle&lt;/a&gt;, the princess of &lt;a href=\"Rivenspire\"&gt;Rivenspire&lt;/a&gt; and daughter of &lt;a href=\"King%20Ranser\"&gt;King Ranser&lt;/a&gt;. But he instead went for &lt;a href=\"Maraya\"&gt;Maraya&lt;/a&gt;, the princess of &lt;a href=\"Sentinel\"&gt;Sentinel&lt;/a&gt; and daughter of &lt;a href=\"Fahara%27jad\"&gt;Fahara'jad&lt;/a&gt;, the leader of Hammerfell. On the Spring of &lt;a href=\"2E%20566\"&gt;2E 566&lt;/a&gt;, Emeric and Maraya were married, cementing High Rock and Hammerfell's relationship as the Second Daggerfall Covenant. But as this was going on, King Ranser had amassed an army consisting of the Houses of Rivenspire, and so &lt;a href=\"King%20Ranser%27s%20War\"&gt;King Ranser's War&lt;/a&gt; had begun.\nKing Ranser's War was a civil war between the Kingdom of Rivenspire and the Second Daggerfall Covenant, beginning with the &lt;a href=\"Siege%20of%20Wayrest%20%282E%20566%29\"&gt;Siege of Wayrest&lt;/a&gt; in 2E 566. King Ranser's Army was made from the various Houses of Rivenspire, from the religious zealots of &lt;a href=\"House%20Tamrith\"&gt;House Tamrith&lt;/a&gt;, to the maritime experts of &lt;a href=\"House%20Dorell\"&gt;House Dorell&lt;/a&gt;, and even the wizards of &lt;a href=\"House%20Montclair\"&gt;House Montclair&lt;/a&gt;. Ranser descended down towards the Iliac Bay, bypassing both &lt;a href=\"Alcaire\"&gt;Alcaire&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Menevia\"&gt;Menevia&lt;/a&gt;, entering the outskirts of Wayrest and commencing the siege. Unlike Durcorach's shoddy attack, Ranser's forces and the &lt;a href=\"Oldgate%20Lancers\"&gt;Oldgate Lancers&lt;/a&gt; were giving the Covenant a hard time. High King Emeric, wielding the &lt;a href=\"Orichalc%20Scalpel\"&gt;Orichalc Scalpel&lt;/a&gt;, and his Cumberland Guard led the defense for Wayrest. Wielding the enchanted longsword, the Orichalc Scalpel, Emeric was able to defeat the Oldgate Lancers, breaking the offense and forcing Ranser to flee north. The Bretons and the &lt;a href=\"Redguards\"&gt;Redguards&lt;/a&gt; had followed suit, razing the city of Shornhelm, and cornering them at &lt;a href=\"Markwasten%20Moor\"&gt;Markwasten Moor&lt;/a&gt;. At this point, the two factions were in a stalemate, but a new ally would rain down from the &lt;a href=\"Wrothgarian%20Mountains\"&gt;Wrothgarian Mountains&lt;/a&gt;, in the form of the &lt;a href=\"Orsimer\"&gt;Orsimer&lt;/a&gt;, under &lt;a href=\"Kurog%20gro-Bagrakh\"&gt;Kurog gro-Bagrakh&lt;/a&gt;. Eventually, Ranser and his army were defeated, and the Daggerfall Covenant became the Greater Covenant, with the inclusion of the Orsimer. From then on, the Covenant had prospered, shifting their motives when &lt;a href=\"Varen%20Aquilarios\"&gt;Varen Aquilarios&lt;/a&gt; disappears from the &lt;a href=\"Imperial%20City\"&gt;Imperial City&lt;/a&gt;. With this, the Covenant had joined the fray as one of the three factions of the &lt;a href=\"Alliance%20War\"&gt;Alliance War&lt;/a&gt;, with the intent of bringing back the Empires of old. Initiatives would be made to further establish the Daggerfall Covenant.\nPlot against Duchess Lakana; Flames of Treachery.\nDuring the &lt;a href=\"Interregnum\"&gt;Interregnum&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"2E%20582\"&gt;2E 582&lt;/a&gt;, the group known as the &lt;a href=\"Supernal%20Dreamers\"&gt;Supernal Dreamers&lt;/a&gt; had begun to appear throughout Stormhaven, being seen around &lt;a href=\"Koeglin%20Village\"&gt;Koeglin Village&lt;/a&gt; and the Alcaire fields. They are worshippers of &lt;a href=\"Vaermina\"&gt;Vaermina&lt;/a&gt;, the Daedric Prince of Nightmares, whose influence is not as abrasive as &lt;a href=\"Molag%20Bal\"&gt;Molag Bal&lt;/a&gt;. The Supernal Dreamers were not as threatening until the events in Alcaire Castle. Around this time, Alcaire was ruled by &lt;a href=\"Duke%20Nathaniel\"&gt;Duke Nathaniel&lt;/a&gt;, who decided to marry &lt;a href=\"Lakana\"&gt;Lakana&lt;/a&gt;, the second-daughter of Fahara'jad, to further cement the Covenant's relationship. Because of this Fahara'jad had sent warriors of the &lt;a href=\"Alik%27r%20Desert\"&gt;Alik'r&lt;/a&gt; to protect Lakana, should anything happened, this raised suspicion in the Knights of the Flame, specifically &lt;a href=\"Dame%20Falhut\"&gt;Dame Falhut&lt;/a&gt;, who was entirely suspicious of Lakana. Thus creating a plot against the newly-named Duchess. An &lt;a href=\"Vestige\"&gt;Agent&lt;/a&gt; of the Covenant had traveled to Alcaire Castle, investigating the situation, on whether there was a plot. &lt;a href=\"Sir%20Hughes\"&gt;Sir Hughes&lt;/a&gt; had intercepted a messenger that was going to Lakana, to which the Agent had confronted the Duchess about it. The Duchess had been worried about assassins when several of her servants had died. Through serious sleuthing, it was revealed that Dame Falhut was attempting to poison Lakana, with this news, Sir Hughes took to protecting the Duchess while the Agent had disposed of Falhut. But as that was happening, Sir Hughes had slain Duchess Lakana in her room, fleeing for &lt;a href=\"Firebrand%20Keep\"&gt;Firebrand Keep&lt;/a&gt;. A grieving Duke Nathaniel had ordered the Agent with tracking down Sir Hughes.\nThe Battle of Firebrand Keep &amp; the Omen of Fear.\nSir Hughes had fled to Firebrand Keep, to take arms and attack the Alik'r Camp outside of Alcaire Castle. The Agent of the Covenant had infiltrated Firebrand, garnering help from &lt;a href=\"Sir%20Edmund\"&gt;Sir Edmund&lt;/a&gt;. The Knights are split on whether to attack the Alik'r or not, so the Agent and Edmund traversed the castle, persuading Knights to defect from &lt;a href=\"Sir%20Croix\"&gt;Sir Croix&lt;/a&gt;'s invasion, to prevent such an attack. And so with enough people, both factions attacked each other in Firebrand Keep, Edmund's resistance against Croix's forces. The Firebrand Siege Horn had been sounded, and so the Battle of Firebrand had commenced. The resistance stormed the Keep from the west, taking hold in the central bridge. The Agent infiltrated the garrison, killing Sir Croix and capturing Sir Hughes. In the infirmary, Sir Hughes had been captured and unconscious, the Keep Healer, &lt;a href=\"Odette%20Jerick\"&gt;Odette Jerick&lt;/a&gt;, was tending to the Knight, but an ominous dark cloud had enveloped him. As the Agent checked on him, they were sent to an alternate, dream-state of Alcaire Castle, where he encountered Sir Hughes and the &lt;a href=\"Omen%20of%20Fear\"&gt;Omen of Fear&lt;/a&gt;. The Agent was able to defeat the Omen, and Sir Hughes' fate was decided, though unknown. These dark clouds have peeked the interest of Duke Nathaniel, and so the Agent was sent to the &lt;a href=\"Fiefdom%20of%20Menevia\"&gt;Fiefdom of Menevia&lt;/a&gt;, to convene with the &lt;a href=\"Spirit%20Wardens\"&gt;Spirit Wardens&lt;/a&gt; of the &lt;a href=\"Pariah%20Abbey\"&gt;Pariah Abbey&lt;/a&gt;.\nRaid on the Pariah Abbey &amp; the Midnight Union.\nSeveral years later in &lt;a href=\"2E%20582\"&gt;2E 582&lt;/a&gt;, Abbot Durak is still the leader of the Spirit Wardens, with many priests coming and going in his lifetime. Around this time, the Supernal Dreamers had begun to make their move, beginning with Sir Hughes of the Flame, one way or the other, the &lt;a href=\"Midnight%20Union\"&gt;Midnight Union&lt;/a&gt; had begun to unleash raids throughout Menevia, beginning with the &lt;a href=\"Pariah%20Abbey\"&gt;Pariah Abbey&lt;/a&gt; and burning their fields. The &lt;a href=\"Vestige\"&gt;Agent&lt;/a&gt; of the Covenant had intervened and doused the flames, but the Abbey was still in danger. Durak had rescued several priests and taken them to the &lt;a href=\"Cave%20of%20Dreams\"&gt;Cave of Dreams&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;a href=\"Wrothgarian%20Mountains\"&gt;Wrothgarian Mountains&lt;/a&gt;, where the Agent was given a summoning scroll to quell the largest fires. The Union had cast a nightmare spell onto Durak, which brought him into a great slumber. As the Wardens were fighting the Union, the bandits had stolen the &lt;a href=\"Dream%20Shard\"&gt;Dream Shard&lt;/a&gt;, a powerful artifact of &lt;a href=\"Azura\"&gt;Azura&lt;/a&gt;. With the Midnight Union gone, the Agent was forced to drink the &lt;a href=\"Dreamstride\"&gt;Dreamstride&lt;/a&gt; potion and rescue Durak from the spell. In the end, Abbot Durak was saved, but the Dream Shard was at large. &lt;a href=\"High%20King%20Emeric\"&gt;High King Emeric&lt;/a&gt; believed that &lt;a href=\"Count%20Hosni%20at-Tura\"&gt;Count Hosni at-Tura&lt;/a&gt; has the Dream Shard, since he was the leader of the Midnight Union.\nCount Hosni at-Tura of the Midnight Union.\nThe Agent of the Covenant had arrived on the grounds of the &lt;a href=\"At-Tura%20Estate\"&gt;At-Tura Estate&lt;/a&gt; amidst a party. Count Hosni at-Tura was a member of the Court of Wayrest, who had recently been engaged with a Redguard noble named &lt;a href=\"Lady%20Adima\"&gt;Lady Adima&lt;/a&gt;. Unknown to the events at the Pariah Abbey, Hosni was celebrating the moment, but his mother was against this, being suspicious of Adima and her intentions, seeing as Hosni's behavior has been odd. The Agent had retrieved the signet ring of the At-Tura from &lt;a href=\"Lord%20Rihad%20at-Tura\"&gt;Lord Rihad at-Tura&lt;/a&gt;, which was needed to pass the estate to Hosni. Lady Sirali, Hosni's mother, had tasked the Agent with investigating Adima, by traveling to an encampment along the coast, as well as, the summer home down the hill. The Agent learned that Adima was a member of the Supernal Dreamers, and so the warrior took another dose of the Dreamstride potion, encountering Adima as the &lt;a href=\"Omen%20of%20Blood\"&gt;Omen of Blood&lt;/a&gt;. In the end, the witch was killed, and Hosni at-Tura was brought back to his senses. For saving her son, Lady Sirali had given the Agent the Dream Shard, to which it was delivered to Abbot Durak at the Pariah Abbey. But as this was going on, the &lt;a href=\"Ironhand%20Ogres\"&gt;Ironhand Ogres&lt;/a&gt; were fighting against the &lt;a href=\"Murtag%20Clan\"&gt;Murtag Clan&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Gavaudon\"&gt;Gavaudon&lt;/a&gt;. High King Emeric had sent the Agent to help the Orsimer in their battle at &lt;a href=\"Shinji%27s%20Scarp\"&gt;Shinji's Scarp&lt;/a&gt;.\nBattle for Shinji's Scarp &amp; Godrun gro-Murtag.\nThe Murtag Clan under the command of Godrun gro-Murtag had fought against the &lt;a href=\"Ironhand%20Ogres\"&gt;Ironhand Ogres&lt;/a&gt; of Gavaudon, when they invaded through a mountain pass near Shinji's Scarp. General Godrun's plan was to utilize miners in a caving in the cave that the Ogres used from Wrothgar. The Agent of the Covenant had traveled to the Murtag's closest tower, sounding the war horn and beginning the battle at Shinji's Scarp. The Murtag Clan stormed the Ogre's hideout, securing the northern front. The Agent was able to cave in and destroy the mine, ending their invasion, but &lt;a href=\"Vaermina\"&gt;Vaermina&lt;/a&gt; would step in and take control of General Godrun, similar to Sir Hughes in Alcaire and Count At-Tura in Menevia. The &lt;a href=\"Omen%20of%20Betrayal\"&gt;Omen of Betrayal&lt;/a&gt;, which Vaermina implanted, failed in its mission to persuade Godrun with attacking &lt;a href=\"Wayrest\"&gt;Wayrest&lt;/a&gt;. Abbot Durak arrived onto the Murtag Clanhold with the Dreamstride, to which the Agent drank it and entered &lt;a href=\"Godrun%27s%20Dream%20%28Location%29\"&gt;Godrun's Dream&lt;/a&gt;, which was a pocket of &lt;a href=\"Quagmire\"&gt;Quagmire&lt;/a&gt;. Deep in the valleys of Quagmire, the Agent defeated the Omen, saving the Orcish general. But as this was happening, Vaermina began to make her move, on Wayrest and King Emeric, but &lt;a href=\"Azura\"&gt;Azura&lt;/a&gt; decided to help her apostles, and sought the Agent's help in ridding her cult from her shrine at the &lt;a href=\"Weeping%20Giant\"&gt;Weeping Giant&lt;/a&gt;.\nVaermina's Gambit; Trouble at Wayrest.\nThe Agent traveled to the pinnacle of the Weeping Giant, where they convened with Azura's servant after gathering &lt;a href=\"Azurite\"&gt;Azurite&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Glow%20Dust\"&gt;Glow Dust&lt;/a&gt; throughout Gavaudon. With materials, the Agent had cleansed the shrine, which was tainted by the Supernal Dreamers. With the shrine clean, Abbot Durak took to treating High King Emeric at Castle Wayrest. The &lt;a href=\"Galthis\"&gt;Night Terror&lt;/a&gt;, Vaermina's Consort had taken control of Emeric's mind, placing him in a nightmare, within a demented version of Wayrest. Taking the Dreamstride once more, the Agent delved into Emeric's dream, defeating illusions of Sir Hughes, Count Hosni, and General Godrun, gaining keys needed to enter the fake Castle Wayrest. It was there, the Agent defeated the Night Terror, freeing the King from his dream, but at that point, they were stuck in Quagmire, wondering the dark valleys and encountering an aspect of Vaermina. Eventually, both warriors were able to escape Quagmire, ending Vaermina's reign over Stormhaven. The Spirit Warden's original goal had been fulfilled, continuing their existence by worshipping their patron, Azura. However, Emeric was unable to get his well-deserved rest, as tension in the &lt;a href=\"Rivenspire\"&gt;Rivenspire&lt;/a&gt; region had grown. &lt;a href=\"House%20Montclair\"&gt;House Montclair&lt;/a&gt; had supposedly annexed half of &lt;a href=\"Shornhelm\"&gt;Shornhelm&lt;/a&gt;, the capital of the region.\nThe Rise of Tiber Septim &amp; the Tiber Wars.\nFor a long time, the Fiefdom of Alcaire has a fable circling their seat of power, the Alcaire settlement. One of these days, an influential ruler would be born within the Castle's ramparts, and low and beyond, &lt;a href=\"Hjalti%20Early-Beard\"&gt;Hjalti Early-Beard&lt;/a&gt; was born in Alcaire, out of Nordic heritage. Hjalti traveled east to the city-state of &lt;a href=\"Falkreath\"&gt;Falkreath&lt;/a&gt;, where he would work under the &lt;a href=\"Colovian\"&gt;Colovian&lt;/a&gt; King, &lt;a href=\"Cuhlecain\"&gt;Cuhlecain&lt;/a&gt;. Cuhlecain was one of the petty kings of the &lt;a href=\"Colovian%20Estates\"&gt;Colovian Estates&lt;/a&gt;, an autonomous government separate from the &lt;a href=\"Imperial%20City\"&gt;Imperial City&lt;/a&gt;. After the successful &lt;a href=\"Battle%20of%20Old%20Hroldan\"&gt;Battle of Old Hroldan&lt;/a&gt;, Cuhlecain and his prized general, Hjalti Early-Beard took to uniting the Colovian Estates and assuming the &lt;a href=\"Ruby%20Throne\"&gt;Ruby Throne&lt;/a&gt;. Eventually, Cuhlecain became the new &lt;a href=\"Emperor\"&gt;Emperor&lt;/a&gt; of Cyrodiil, much to the dismay of the Nords and Bretons in the north. The Nord-Breton forces took control of northern strongholds, using the ruins of &lt;a href=\"Sancre%20Tor\"&gt;Sancre Tor&lt;/a&gt; as their base. With what little he had, General Talos, as he was being called, attacked them, beginning the &lt;a href=\"Battle%20of%20Sancre%20Tor\"&gt;Battle of Sancre Tor&lt;/a&gt;. With his powerful &lt;a href=\"Thu%27um\"&gt;Thu'um&lt;/a&gt;, Talos had broken through Sancre Tor's defense. Because of his mastery of the Voice, and their already suspicious feeling towards the Bretons, the Nords allied with Talos and his Cyrodiilic Army. And so Sancre Tor was captured, and their tirade was over. Cuhlecain was killed by a Breton Nightblade, leaving the position to Talos, who became known as &lt;a href=\"Tiber%20Septim\"&gt;Tiber Septim&lt;/a&gt;. This began the &lt;a href=\"Tiber%20Wars\"&gt;Tiber Wars&lt;/a&gt;, beginning with the province of High Rock.\nThe province of High Rock was largely untamed, with the &lt;a href=\"Western%20Reach\"&gt;Western Reach&lt;/a&gt; being an open frontier for the Bretons. When Tiber Septim's forces were moving into High Rock, the Western Reach was claimed by the newly-established &lt;a href=\"Third%20Empire\"&gt;Third Empire&lt;/a&gt;, with &lt;a href=\"Titus%20Alorius\"&gt;Titus Alorius&lt;/a&gt; proclaimed as the Provisional Governor of the Western Reach. The city-state of Wayrest was heavily opposed to the coming Third Empire, waging war with them in the &lt;a href=\"Battle%20of%20Bjoulsae\"&gt;Battle of Bjoulsae&lt;/a&gt;, a maritime battle between Wayrest's navy and the &lt;a href=\"Northwest%20Fleet\"&gt;Northwest Fleet&lt;/a&gt;. This battle was the debut of &lt;a href=\"Amiel%20Richton\"&gt;Amiel Richton&lt;/a&gt;, a Colovian officer that commanded a squadron, which led to the fleet's victory over Wayrest. From then on, the Northwest Fleet surveyed the Iliac Bay, providing a way better job at dealing with pirates than the Kingdoms of the Iliac. With the province of High Rock captured, the &lt;a href=\"Imperial%20Legion\"&gt;Imperial Legion&lt;/a&gt; moved southwards to the &lt;a href=\"Alik%27r%20Desert\"&gt;Alik'r Desert&lt;/a&gt;, taking the city-state of &lt;a href=\"Sentinel\"&gt;Sentinel&lt;/a&gt; and the island &lt;a href=\"Kingdom%20of%20Stros%20M%27Kai\"&gt;Kingdom of Stros M'Kai&lt;/a&gt;.\n&lt;a href=\"Third%20Era\"&gt;Third Era&lt;/a&gt;.\nDuel for Orsinium; Enter Gortwog gro-Nagorm.\nAs time went on, the &lt;a href=\"Second%20Orsinium\"&gt;Second Orsinium&lt;/a&gt; was destroyed, leaving the Orsimer scattered throughout the land. But like Torug gro-Igron and Kurog gro-Bagrakh before, another visionary would rise from the wastes of Wrothgaria to unite the Orcs under the banner of Orsinium. That was &lt;a href=\"Gortwog%20gro-Nagorm\"&gt;Gortwog gro-Nagorm&lt;/a&gt;, a member of the &lt;a href=\"Minat%20Clan\"&gt;Minat Clan&lt;/a&gt; of Orcs. A piece of land between the &lt;a href=\"County%20of%20Menevia\"&gt;County of Menevia&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Kingdom%20of%20Wayrest\"&gt;Kingdom of Wayrest&lt;/a&gt; was sought after between both Gortwog and &lt;a href=\"Lord%20Bowyn\"&gt;Lord Bowyn&lt;/a&gt; of Wayrest, each for their own desires. In &lt;a href=\"3E%20399\"&gt;3E 399&lt;/a&gt;, both people sought claim to the land, but both had equal claim to it. And so the two decided on a duel, on whoever receives this bountiful land. The battle took place within the walls of Wayrest, at the courtyard of &lt;a href=\"Lord%20Berylth\"&gt;Lord Berylth&lt;/a&gt;, Bowyn's cousin. Since Gortwog was the first claimant, he was the one who chose the equipment, all of it being Orcish, while Bowyn, being the second claimant chose the location. Bowyn was unprepared, having no experience in Orcish armor, even being trained by Berylth's Orcish servant, &lt;a href=\"Old%20Tunner\"&gt;Old Tunner&lt;/a&gt;, he was unable to best the King of the Orcs. In the end, Gortwog gro-Nagorm claimed the land as the &lt;a href=\"Orsinium%20Area\"&gt;Orsinium Area&lt;/a&gt;, where it would become the home of the &lt;a href=\"Third%20Orsinium\"&gt;Third Orsinium&lt;/a&gt;, named Nova Orsinium. Orsinium grew to become one of the largest kingdoms in the Iliac Bay, equaling in power to Wayrest and Daggerfall.\nStormhaven and its cities during the Simulacrum.\nDuring the &lt;a href=\"Imperial%20Simulacrum\"&gt;Imperial Simulacrum&lt;/a&gt; from &lt;a href=\"3E%20389\"&gt;3E 389&lt;/a&gt; to &lt;a href=\"3E%20399\"&gt;3E 399&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"Imperial\"&gt;Imperial&lt;/a&gt; Battlemage named &lt;a href=\"Jagar%20Tharn\"&gt;Jagar Tharn&lt;/a&gt; impersonated Emperor &lt;a href=\"Uriel%20Septim%20VII\"&gt;Uriel Septim VII&lt;/a&gt; and cast both him and &lt;a href=\"Talin%20Warhaft\"&gt;Talin Warhaft&lt;/a&gt; into the &lt;a href=\"Deadlands\"&gt;Deadlands&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Mehrunes%20Dagon\"&gt;Mehrunes Dagon&lt;/a&gt;'s plane of &lt;a href=\"Oblivion\"&gt;Oblivion&lt;/a&gt;. Jagar Tharn had a mighty staff called the &lt;a href=\"Staff%20of%20Chaos\"&gt;Staff of Chaos&lt;/a&gt; which was the key to releasing Uriel and Warhaft from the Deadlands. To secure his control, he broke the Staff of Chaos into several pieces and hid them across the provinces in Tamriel. Tharn's apprentice, &lt;a href=\"Ria%20Silmane\"&gt;Ria Silmane&lt;/a&gt; caught wind of this and planned to tell the &lt;a href=\"Elder%20Council\"&gt;Elder Council&lt;/a&gt;, however, Tharn killed her with his vile magic. Ria Silmane's spirit sought the aid of a warrior also kept imprisoned by Tharn. Silmane help the warrior escaped and tasked them with finding the pieces of the Staff of Chaos throughout Tamriel. At one point, this warrior traveled to the city of Wayrest during their quest to gather the pieces. The warrior defeat Jagar Tharn at the &lt;a href=\"Imperial%20Palace\"&gt;Imperial Palace&lt;/a&gt; and freed both Uriel VII and Talin Warhaft, this young warrior was named the &lt;a href=\"Eternal%20Champion\"&gt;Eternal Champion&lt;/a&gt;. The region of Stormhaven was undefined, and many settlements dotted the landscape or at least the general area. Smaller townships such as &lt;a href=\"Norvulk%20Hills\"&gt;Norvulk Hills&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Vermeir%20Wastes\"&gt;Vermeir Wastes&lt;/a&gt; existed in the area.\nThe Royal Family of Wayrest; Eadwyre &amp; Barenziah.\nFor many years, the Kingdom of Wayrest was ruled by &lt;a href=\"King%20Eadwyre\"&gt;King Eadwyre&lt;/a&gt;, along with his wife, &lt;a href=\"Queen%20Carolyna\"&gt;Queen Carolyna&lt;/a&gt;. The two had only one child by the name of &lt;a href=\"Elysana\"&gt;Elysana&lt;/a&gt;, who grew up to be a stubborn and ambitious politician, being dubbed as the New Wolf Queen by her peers. Eadwyre has established himself in the politics of the Empire, befriending various figures such as Uriel Septim VII and &lt;a href=\"Symmachus\"&gt;Symmachus&lt;/a&gt;, the King of &lt;a href=\"Mournhold\"&gt;Mournhold&lt;/a&gt;. During the Imperial Simulacrum, the lower plains of Morrowind had suffered from the &lt;a href=\"Arnesian%20War\"&gt;Arnesian War&lt;/a&gt;, which resulted in the death of Symmachus at the Royal Palace of Mournhold. His wife, &lt;a href=\"Queen%20Barenziah\"&gt;Queen Barenziah&lt;/a&gt; had traveled to the Imperial City to discuss business with \"Uriel VII\", who was in reality Jagar Tharn. At one point in time, Carolyna had passed away, leaving the elder king to rule Wayrest alone. When Barenziah was in mourning, Eadwyre went to her side, confirming her suspicions of \"Uriel VII's\" true identity. With the help of the spirit of Ria Silmane's help, Eadwyre and Barenziah were able to uncover each location of the Staff pieces and help free the Eternal Champion from the Imperial Prisons. From then on, Barenziah married Eadwyre, and her family moved to Wayrest. Elysana was to rule after her father passed away, but with the presence of &lt;a href=\"Helseth%20Hlaalu\"&gt;Helseth Hlaalu&lt;/a&gt;, the position was left up in the air. &lt;a href=\"Morgiah\"&gt;Morgiah&lt;/a&gt;, Barenziah's second child had lived in Wayrest for a few years until she left for &lt;a href=\"Firsthold\"&gt;Firsthold&lt;/a&gt;, where she married King &lt;a href=\"Reman%20Karoodil\"&gt;Reman Karoodil&lt;/a&gt;. Regardless, Eadwyre's family would have a great effect on the Iliac Bay in the coming years.\nThe War of Betony &amp; Lysandus' Plot.\nIn &lt;a href=\"3E%20403\"&gt;3E 403&lt;/a&gt;, the Kingdoms of Daggerfall and Sentinel waged war for the island nation of &lt;a href=\"Betony\"&gt;Betony&lt;/a&gt;, which is located at the mouth of the Iliac Bay. The Kingdom of Wayrest was neutral in the conflict, though it played a part in the schemes of &lt;a href=\"Lord%20Woodborne\"&gt;Lord Woodborne&lt;/a&gt;, a nobleman of Wayrest. Woodborne had sought power over the Kingdom of Wayrest, by betrothing Princess Elysana. However, with the arrival of Barenziah and Helseth, his plans were halted. And so Woodborne sought the help from Daggerfall, specifically from &lt;a href=\"King%20Lysandus\"&gt;King Lysandus&lt;/a&gt;, the leader of Daggerfall. While Lysandus sought to take over Betony, in reality, he wanted to leave his throne to his son, &lt;a href=\"Gothryd\"&gt;Gothryd&lt;/a&gt;, so that he could be with his true love, &lt;a href=\"Medora%20Direnni\"&gt;Medora Direnni&lt;/a&gt; at the &lt;a href=\"Isle%20of%20Balfiera\"&gt;Isle of Balfiera&lt;/a&gt;. And so a convoluted plot was made where Lysandus had faked his death at the &lt;a href=\"Battle%20of%20Cryngaine%20Field\"&gt;Battle of Cryngaine Field&lt;/a&gt; and met with Woodborne, whose accompanied with the &lt;a href=\"Minat%20Clan\"&gt;Minat Clan&lt;/a&gt; of Orcs at &lt;a href=\"Tamarilyn%20Point\"&gt;Tamarilyn Point&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;a href=\"County%20of%20Menevia\"&gt;County of Menevia&lt;/a&gt;. Woodborne pleaded with Lysandus to support him should he usurp Helseth, but the former King denied his request. Because of this, Woodborne tasked his Minat mercenaries with killing Lysandus and burying him in a tomb in Menevia.\nBut this was not the last they have heard of Lysandus. His spirit had returned within the Kingdom of Daggerfall, calling for vengeance on the man who took his life. This had brought the attention of &lt;a href=\"Uriel%20Septim%20VII\"&gt;Uriel Septim VII&lt;/a&gt;, who had sent an &lt;a href=\"Agent\"&gt;Agent&lt;/a&gt; to Daggerfall with the hopes of solving this problem. With the help of Medora Direnni at the &lt;a href=\"Direnni%20Tower\"&gt;Direnni Tower&lt;/a&gt;, Lysandus was able to speak with the Agent, who informed them of his true fate and his killer, Lord Woodborne. Taking the orders of the deceased king, the Agent traveled to the Kingdom of Wayrest, where he confronted and killed Lord Woodborne at his home. With his death, King Lysandus was finally at peace, ascending to &lt;a href=\"Aetherius\"&gt;Aetherius&lt;/a&gt; where he would remain forever.\nThe Warp in the West &amp; Rise of Queen Elysana.\nSometime in &lt;a href=\"3E%20405\"&gt;3E 405&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"Totem%20of%20Tiber%20Septim\"&gt;Totem of Tiber Septim&lt;/a&gt; had appeared throughout the Iliac Bay, prompting a race between the highest nobility with obtaining the powerful artifact. But because of this, the four major kingdoms of the Iliac waged war with each other with the intent of taking complete control of the land. This war lasted for several years, areas throughout the &lt;a href=\"Bjoulsae%20River\"&gt;Bjoulsae River&lt;/a&gt; such as &lt;a href=\"Gavaudon\"&gt;Gavaudon&lt;/a&gt; were razed because of the conflict. Everything would change on the 11th of &lt;a href=\"Frostfall\"&gt;Frostfall&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"3E%20417\"&gt;3E 417&lt;/a&gt;. A magical anomaly called a &lt;a href=\"Dragon%20Break\"&gt;Dragon Break&lt;/a&gt; had occurred all over the Iliac Bay. A Dragon Break is when every possible outcome occurs at the same time. One such outcome included Wayrest taking over all of the Iliac. This particular Dragon Break was known as the &lt;a href=\"Warp%20in%20the%20West\"&gt;Warp in the West&lt;/a&gt;, and it subsequently brought peace to the Iliac, splitting it into four separate kingdoms, as opposed to the forty-four individual nations. The Kingdom of Wayrest expanded to the eastern lands of the &lt;a href=\"Fiefdom%20of%20Anticlere\"&gt;Fiefdom of Anticlere&lt;/a&gt;, all the way to the &lt;a href=\"Fiefdom%20of%20Gavaudon\"&gt;Fiefdom of Gavaudon&lt;/a&gt;. This time of peace would last for many years, though Eadwyre would not experience much of this when he passed away sometime later, leaving the throne between Elysana and Helseth.\nIn the end, Elysana assumed the throne of Wayrest, overpowering the notorious Helseth, who would always get what he wants. Queen Elysana grew to become one of the most feared rulers in the Western World, like her stepbrother, who would become the King of Mournhold after tension in Morrowind had decreased. Elysana was as ruthless, as she was cunning. With her consort, Elysana ruled over Wayrest, making an alliance with &lt;a href=\"Gortwog%20gro-Nagorm\"&gt;Gortwog gro-Nagorm&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Nova%20Orsinium\"&gt;Nova Orsinium&lt;/a&gt;. Elysana would rule over Wayrest, all the way into the &lt;a href=\"Fourth%20Era\"&gt;Fourth Era&lt;/a&gt;.\n&lt;a href=\"Fourth%20Era\"&gt;Fourth Era&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe Invasion of Wayrest; Barynia's Folly.\nIn &lt;a href=\"4E%20188\"&gt;4E 188&lt;/a&gt;, the Kingdom of Wayrest was ruled by &lt;a href=\"King%20Barynia\"&gt;King Barynia&lt;/a&gt;, who was a paranoid and schizophrenic person. His rule was very controversial, bringing contempt to the nobles of Wayrest. Due to his paranoia, Barynia decided that his city needed to suffer, and so he opened the ports to &lt;a href=\"Corsair\"&gt;Corsair&lt;/a&gt;s of the Iliac Bay. Thus began the &lt;a href=\"Invasion%20of%20Wayrest\"&gt;Invasion of Wayrest&lt;/a&gt; on the 7th of &lt;a href=\"Sun%27s%20Height\"&gt;Sun's Height&lt;/a&gt;, where the Corsairs raided Wayrest, killing the populous in numbers. However, Barynia's paranoia was not entirely unwarranted, nobles of Wayrest had contacted the &lt;a href=\"Dark%20Brotherhood\"&gt;Dark Brotherhood&lt;/a&gt; with assassinating the King. Around this time, &lt;a href=\"Princess%20Barynia\"&gt;Princess Barynia&lt;/a&gt; was kidnapped by bandits to blackmail the King, though she was fortunately saved by a passerby in &lt;a href=\"Dreughside\"&gt;Dreughside&lt;/a&gt;. With the King's Guard defeated, Barynia's fate was now at the hands of the Brotherhood Assassin. At that point, the &lt;a href=\"Wayrest%20Sanctuary\"&gt;Wayrest Sanctuary&lt;/a&gt; had already been raided, ending the Brotherhood's presence in High Rock. The king's fate is unknown, either the contract had been completed, or he fled Wayrest, never to be seen again. Wayrest was sacked but was rebuilt sometime later."}

This is thanks to the port-city of Wayrest on the mouth of the &lt;a href=\"Bjoulsae%20River\"&gt;Bjoulsae River&lt;/a&gt; and the head of the &lt;a href=\"Iliac%20Bay\"&gt;Iliac Bay&lt;/a&gt;, which receives many trading ships every day, and houses many &lt;a href=\"Bretons%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Breton&lt;/a&gt; businessmen who practice their trade in Wayrest's Market District. Stormhaven also houses many rich industries, including &lt;a href=\"mining\"&gt;mining&lt;/a&gt;, farming, &lt;a href=\"Fishing%20%28Online%29\"&gt;fishing&lt;/a&gt; and hunting. A ship to and from the city of &lt;a href=\"Sentinel%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Sentinel&lt;/a&gt; can be caught at the docks in both Wayrest and Sentinel.\nStormhaven, being in High Rock, is mostly populated by Bretons, along with a few &lt;a href=\"Redguards%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Redguards&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Orsimer%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Orsimer&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Ogre%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Ogres&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Goblin%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Goblins&lt;/a&gt; and other races. Despite the signing of the &lt;a href=\"Daggerfall%20Covenant\"&gt;Daggerfall Covenant&lt;/a&gt;, most Bretons in the region harbor a deep distrust for the Orsimer.\nBackground.\nThousands of years ago, an &lt;a href=\"Aldmer\"&gt;Aldmer&lt;/a&gt;i clan called the\u00a0&lt;a href=\"Direnni%20Clan\"&gt;Direnni&lt;/a&gt; discovered the\u00a0&lt;a href=\"Adamantine%20Tower\"&gt;Adamantine Tower&lt;/a&gt; on the &lt;a href=\"Isle%20of%20Balfiera%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Isle of Balfiera&lt;/a&gt;\u00a0in the Middle &lt;a href=\"Merethic%20Era\"&gt;Merethic Era&lt;/a&gt;,\u00a0and claimed both the tower and most of the &lt;a href=\"Iliac%20Bay\"&gt;Iliac Bay&lt;/a&gt; region, naming the tower the Direnni Tower in honor of the clan. For a time, they ruled all of High Rock,\u00a0and at least a part of Stormhaven was part of their kingdom for virtually their entire hegemony.\nThe Direnni frequently interbred with\u00a0the local &lt;a href=\"Nede\"&gt;Nede&lt;/a&gt;s, so frequently that the half-elven race which inevitably resulted from these interbreedings were so numerous that it formed an entirely new race, the &lt;a href=\"Bretons\"&gt;Bretons&lt;/a&gt;. The Direnni were very few in number, and established a feudal, hierarchical system to control their vast empire, which now included parts of &lt;a href=\"Hammerfell\"&gt;Hammerfell&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Skyrim\"&gt;Skyrim&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe Bretons became a privileged middle class within Direnni society. The Aldmer ruled High Rock for untold generations, but following their clash with the &lt;a href=\"Alessian%20Order\"&gt;Alessian Order&lt;/a&gt; during the\u00a0&lt;a href=\"Battle%20of%20Glenumbra%20Moors%20%28Event%29\"&gt;Battle of Glenumbra Moors&lt;/a&gt;\u00a0in &lt;a href=\"1E%20482\"&gt;1E 482&lt;/a&gt;, they lost control of their vast domain and retreated back to their Direnni Tower. The Elves were replaced by the Breton noble families and carried on, eventually joining the\u00a0&lt;a href=\"Alessian%20Empire\"&gt;First Empire&lt;/a&gt;\u00a0in\u00a0&lt;a href=\"1E%201029\"&gt;1E 1029&lt;/a&gt; and becoming the dominant race in the province.\u00a0When High Rock decided to secede from the Empire in\u00a0&lt;a href=\"1E%202305\"&gt;1E 2305&lt;/a&gt;, near the Empire's dissolution due to the &lt;a href=\"War%20of%20Righteousness\"&gt;War of Righteousness&lt;/a&gt;.\nTrade.\nThe great cities of &lt;a href=\"Alcaire\"&gt;Alcaire&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Wayrest%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Wayrest&lt;/a&gt;, along with other, smaller settlements, make Stormhaven one of the two most populous regions of High Rock, the other being &lt;a href=\"Glenumbra%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Glenumbra&lt;/a&gt;. While there is significant traffic between these two regions,\u00a0Stormhaven also has strong diplomatic ties with\u00a0&lt;a href=\"Rivenspire\"&gt;Rivenspire&lt;/a&gt; to the north, despite the legacy left by &lt;a href=\"King%20Ranser%27s%20War\"&gt;King Ranser's War&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe Supernal Dreamers.\nIn the year\u00a02E 582, while still recovering from the destruction caused by\u00a0&lt;a href=\"Ranser%27s%20War\"&gt;Ranser's War&lt;/a&gt; fifteen years earlier,\u00a0Stormhaven was blighted by a cult of\u00a0&lt;a href=\"Vaermina\"&gt;Vaermina&lt;/a&gt; worshippers called the &lt;a href=\"Supernal%20Dreamers\"&gt;Supernal Dreamers&lt;/a&gt;. What started as a few isolated incidents in &lt;a href=\"Alcaire%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Alcaire&lt;/a&gt; soon spread across the entirety of Stormhaven: raids, kidnappings, and rumors of &lt;a href=\"Daedra%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Daedric&lt;/a&gt; pacts sent fear sweeping through the populace.\u00a0The Dreamers sought to spread their influence even further and eventually converge their forces on Wayrest itself, and thereby make the &lt;a href=\"Daggerfall%20Covenant\"&gt;Daggerfall Covenant&lt;/a&gt; collapse by sending &lt;a href=\"High%20King%20Emeric%20%28Online%29\"&gt;King Emeric&lt;/a&gt; himself into a waking nightmare. The cult would have succeeded if it weren't for the timely intervention of the &lt;a href=\"Vestige\"&gt;Vestige&lt;/a&gt;.\nStormhaven was also home to the &lt;a href=\"Spirit%20Wardens\"&gt;Spirit Wardens&lt;/a&gt;, an order of\u00a0Azura\u00a0worshippers founded by an Orsimer named Abbot &lt;a href=\"Durak\"&gt;Durak&lt;/a&gt;, who claimed to have received a vision of the\u00a0Azura. The &lt;a href=\"Daedric%20Prince\"&gt;Daedric Prince&lt;/a&gt; had told Durak to prepare for a time when the people of Stormhaven would be plagued with endless nightmares, and to protect Stormhaven from &lt;a href=\"Vaermina\"&gt;Vaermina&lt;/a&gt; and her dark plot.\nLocations.\nThe following are locations accessible in Stormhaven and, with the exception of &lt;a href=\"Unmarked%20Locations%20%28Online%29\"&gt;unmarked locations&lt;/a&gt;, are discoverable on the map. Points of Interest serve as locations with unique side quests, while &lt;a href=\"Cities%20%28Online%29\"&gt;cities&lt;/a&gt; serve as the centralized areas with multiple sublocations and act as a hub for services and &lt;a href=\"Merchants%20%28Online%29\"&gt;merchants&lt;/a&gt;. Explanations of the types of locations are provided in the &lt;a href=\"Locations%20%28Online%29%23Types\"&gt;main locations page&lt;/a&gt;.\nQuests.\nStormhaven features a series of zone story quests and unrelated side quests. The zone story quests tie into the &lt;a href=\"Daggerfall%20Covenant\"&gt;Daggerfall Covenant&lt;/a&gt;'s overarching storyline and carries on from &lt;a href=\"Glenumbra%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Glenumbra&lt;/a&gt; before continuing to &lt;a href=\"Rivenspire\"&gt;Rivenspire&lt;/a&gt;, but it is not necessary to complete the story quests for zones prior to those in Stormhaven. Side quests are non-sequential and can be completed in any order, except where one carries on from another, and &lt;a href=\"repeatable%20quests\"&gt;repeatable quests&lt;/a&gt; can be completed multiple times: weekly for arenas and trials and daily for all others. Pointer quests are optional zone quests that send the Vestige to the tarting location of another zone quest.\nItem Sets.\nItem sets are related armor and weapons that, when worn together, provide unique benefits. Overland sets can be acquired from world bosses, world events, delves, public dungeons and containers and as quest rewards; dungeon sets can be acquired from within group dungeons; monster sets can be acquired from the final boss of veteran group dungeons and Undaunted Enclaves; and crafted sets can be created at specific locations across the zone.\nSkyshards.\nSixteen Skyshards can be found in Stormhaven totaling in five &lt;a href=\"skill%20points\"&gt;skill points&lt;/a&gt; with one left over. The zone guide provides clues as to the location of each Skyshard, but many can be found simply by exploring and watching for the distinctive pillar of light they emit. Skyshards will appear on the map and compass when the Vestige is close to one and will remain discovered on the map even if it was not collected.\nAchievements.\nAchievements can be earned by completing specific tasks such as completing quests and discovering locations. Achievements are separated into categories and their progress is viewable from the journal. Earning achievement provides the Vestige a number of points, and some achievements unlock unique rewards such as &lt;a href=\"Furnishings%20%28Online%29\"&gt;furnishings&lt;/a&gt; that can be bought from Achievement Furnishers or &lt;a href=\"collectibles\"&gt;collectibles&lt;/a&gt;.\nShalidor's Library.\nThirty-two books that are a part of Shalidor's Library can be found in Stormhaven and added to the collection. Books that have already been found in other zones will already be marked as completed in the zone tracker.\nFish.\nFish can be caught from fishing hotspots, ideally with the correct &lt;a href=\"bait\"&gt;bait&lt;/a&gt;. Common fish will be caught most often while rare fish and alternative bait are rare catches. Each zone has unique rare fish than can be caught from hotspots. &lt;a href=\"Slaughterfish%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Slaughterfish&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"trodh\"&gt;trodh&lt;/a&gt; can be caught from foul hotspots, &lt;a href=\"dhufish\"&gt;dhufish&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"longfin\"&gt;longfin&lt;/a&gt; can be caught from saltwater hotspots, &lt;a href=\"silverside%20perch\"&gt;silverside perch&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"spadetail\"&gt;spadetail&lt;/a&gt; can be caught from lake hotspots, and &lt;a href=\"Salmon%20%28Online%29\"&gt;salmon&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"River%20Betty%20%28Online%29\"&gt;river betty&lt;/a&gt; can be caught from river hotspots. &lt;a href=\"Chub\"&gt;Chub&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"minnow\"&gt;minnow&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"shad\"&gt;shad&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"fish%20roe\"&gt;fish roe&lt;/a&gt; can be caught and used as bait from foul, saltwater, lake and river hotspots, respectively."}

{"id": "360206", "revid": "25622775", "url": "https://elderscrolls.fandom.com/wiki?curid=360206", "title": "Stormhold", "text": "Stormhold or Silyanorn (&lt;a href=\"Ayleidoon\"&gt;Ayleidoon&lt;/a&gt;: \"Acorn\") is one of the eight major cities in the province of &lt;a href=\"Black%20Marsh\"&gt;Black Marsh&lt;/a&gt;, being the capital of the &lt;a href=\"Shadowfen\"&gt;Shadowfen&lt;/a&gt; region in the north. Stormhold has had a difficult history with their neighbors, having been targeted and turned into their foothold to the greater province, specifically for the &lt;a href=\"Dark%20Elves\"&gt;Dark Elves&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"Morrowind\"&gt;Morrowind&lt;/a&gt;.\nDescription.\nGeography.\nThe city-state of Stormhold was built atop of the ruins of Silyanorn, which was the original &lt;a href=\"Ayleid\"&gt;Ayleid&lt;/a&gt; settlement that was created during the Merethic Era. The modern-day settlement of Stormhold was built around Silyanorn, which was already enveloped by the regional flora. Stormhold is located along a river, which makes up the northwestern border, and continues along the Shadowfen eastern border. Eastern Stormhold leads towards the region of &lt;a href=\"Deshaan\"&gt;Deshaan&lt;/a&gt;, and the area consists of many Dunmeri homes. Moving westward into the city will show more Argonian-style homes, which are made out of mud and twigs. Stormhold is divided into two distinct areas; Outer Stormhold is the home of the &lt;a href=\"Riverside%20Markets\"&gt;Riverside Markets&lt;/a&gt;, which is the local port that continues into the mires and the greater river. Moving towards Inner Stormhold reveals more Ayleid ruins, with the town square and several market stalls. The main ruins contain the local guildhalls, and the &lt;a href=\"Mortuary\"&gt;Mortuary&lt;/a&gt;. Above the city ruins, overlooking the city is the local &lt;a href=\"Hist%20Tree\"&gt;Hist Tree&lt;/a&gt;, which is worshipped throughout the city.\nHistory.\n&lt;a href=\"Merethic%20Era\"&gt;Merethic Era&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe Ayleid diaspora &amp; the Barsaebic Ayleids.\nIn the late Merethic Era, the &lt;a href=\"Ayleid\"&gt;Ayleid&lt;/a&gt;s of &lt;a href=\"Cyrodiil\"&gt;Cyrodiil&lt;/a&gt; waged war with the &lt;a href=\"Barsaebic%20Ayleids\"&gt;Barsaebic Ayleids&lt;/a&gt;, worshippers of the &lt;a href=\"Aedra\"&gt;Aedra&lt;/a&gt;. This event was known as the &lt;a href=\"Narfinsel%20Schism\"&gt;Narfinsel Schism&lt;/a&gt;, and it resulted in the exile of the Barsaebic Ayleids, who fled to the wastes of Black Marsh, creating many settlements that would become modern-day cities. One of these settlements was the city-state of Silyanorn, which would become Stormhold. As time went on, the &lt;a href=\"Alessian%20Slave%20Rebellion\"&gt;Alessian Slave Rebellion&lt;/a&gt; had occurred, with the Daedraphile Ayleids seeking new refuge in an event known as the &lt;a href=\"Ayleid%20Diaspora\"&gt;Ayleid Diaspora&lt;/a&gt;. Many traveled to Black Marsh and Silyanorn, but the Barsaebics decided not to let them in, especially the Elves of &lt;a href=\"Atatar\"&gt;Atatar&lt;/a&gt;, who were at the forefront of the Schism. Fortunately for the Barsaebics, the Alessian Army had never made it to Black Marsh, leaving Silyanorn to prosper longer than the rest of the Ayleids, but even they perished, leaving their ruins abandoned for the Argonians.\n&lt;a href=\"First%20Era\"&gt;First Era&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe Blackwater War &amp; the Great Burn.\nWith the aftermath of the &lt;a href=\"Battle%20of%20Argonia\"&gt;Battle of Argonia&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"1E%202811\"&gt;1E 2811&lt;/a&gt;, the province of Black Marsh was taken under the control of the &lt;a href=\"Second%20Empire\"&gt;Second Empire&lt;/a&gt;, to which cities such as Stormhold and &lt;a href=\"Soulrest\"&gt;Soulrest&lt;/a&gt; were turned into Imperial Prisons. Some Argonian resistance fled into the deep marshes, and the city-state of &lt;a href=\"Helstrom\"&gt;Helstrom&lt;/a&gt;, where the Empire was unable to go after them. Border and Coastal cities were targeted and captured by the Imperials. What followed after was the &lt;a href=\"Blackwater%20War\"&gt;Blackwater War&lt;/a&gt; was a twenty-six-year-old conflict which resulted in Black Marsh's ultimate capture. Three campaigns had been run throughout the province, each consisting of the &lt;a href=\"Imperial%20Legion\"&gt;Imperial Legion&lt;/a&gt;. One, in particular, led by &lt;a href=\"Regulus%20Sardecus\"&gt;Regulus Sardecus&lt;/a&gt; of the &lt;a href=\"Fourth%20Legion\"&gt;Fourth Legion&lt;/a&gt;. Sardecus' utilized legionnaires on the forefront, raiding bordering villages while support would drain swamps and overall destroy the eco-system. The most notorious example was the &lt;a href=\"Great%20Burn\"&gt;Great Burn&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"1E%202828\"&gt;1E 2828&lt;/a&gt;, where support troops under &lt;a href=\"Elissia%20Mallicius\"&gt;Elissia Mallicius&lt;/a&gt; burned a peat bog outside of Stormhold, which was connected to the greater bog of Black Marsh. When it was burned, flames were seen from as far as &lt;a href=\"Soulrest\"&gt;Soulrest&lt;/a&gt;.\n&lt;a href=\"Second%20Era\"&gt;Second Era&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe Knahaten Flu; origins &amp; impact.\nIn &lt;a href=\"2E%20560\"&gt;2E 560&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"Knahaten%20Flu\"&gt;Knahaten Flu&lt;/a&gt; had begun to spread across the province of Black Marsh, and eventually, the entire Western World. The Flu had originated from within the depths of Stormhold, and it had begun to southwards where it would end up in cities such as &lt;a href=\"Alabaster\"&gt;Alabaster&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Leyawiin\"&gt;Leyawiin&lt;/a&gt;. Because of the diseases' origins, many scholars believed there was more to the situation at hand. Some believe that it was from natural sources, while others believe that an Argonian shaman created it in retaliation to his oppressors. But because of the Knahaten Flu, several cultures such as the &lt;a href=\"Kothringi\"&gt;Kothringi&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Lilmothiit\"&gt;Lilmothiit&lt;/a&gt; were exterminated from Black Marsh, and provinces like &lt;a href=\"Elsweyr\"&gt;Elsweyr&lt;/a&gt; were incredibly vulnerable because of the Flu. Races such as the Argonians and the &lt;a href=\"Naga\"&gt;Naga&lt;/a&gt; were unaffected by the Knahaten Flu.\nThe Second Akaviri Invasion &amp; the Ebonheart Pact.\nIn &lt;a href=\"2E%20572\"&gt;2E 572&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"Second%20Akaviri%20Invasion\"&gt;Second Akaviri Invasion&lt;/a&gt; had reached the shores of &lt;a href=\"Stonefalls\"&gt;Stonefalls&lt;/a&gt;. The &lt;a href=\"Kamal\"&gt;Kamal&lt;/a&gt;i warriors under the command of &lt;a href=\"Ada%27Soom%20Dir-Kamal\"&gt;Ada'Soom Dir-Kamal&lt;/a&gt; were going head to head with the combined forces of the &lt;a href=\"Nords\"&gt;Nords&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"Old%20Holds\"&gt;East Skyrim&lt;/a&gt; and the Dark Elves of Morrowind. &lt;a href=\"Almalexia\"&gt;Almalexia&lt;/a&gt; had called the Dark Elves from all corners of the land to help her in the battle against the Akaviri. Before &lt;a href=\"Glathil%20Dres\"&gt;Glathil Dres&lt;/a&gt; could answer the call from &lt;a href=\"Thorn\"&gt;Thorn&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Heita-Meen\"&gt;Heita-Meen&lt;/a&gt; had rebelled against the tyrannical &lt;a href=\"House%20Dres\"&gt;House Dres&lt;/a&gt; and answered the call from the &lt;a href=\"Hist\"&gt;Hist&lt;/a&gt;. With her Argonian Army, consisting of freed slaves and &lt;a href=\"Archein\"&gt;Archein&lt;/a&gt;s of &lt;a href=\"Thornmarsh\"&gt;Thornmarsh&lt;/a&gt;, Heita-Meen traveled towards the city-state of Stormhold where she recruited &lt;a href=\"Walks-in-Ash\"&gt;Walks-in-Ash&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Shellbacks\"&gt;Shellbacks&lt;/a&gt;, a powerful militia of the city. With this army of Argonians, Heita-Meen joined the Nords and Dunmer in their fight against the Akaviri. In the end, Dir-Kamal's forces were defeated, and a new alliance was founded. The &lt;a href=\"Ebonheart%20Pact\"&gt;Ebonheart Pact&lt;/a&gt; became one of the strongest alliances in history.\nThe Vicecanon triad &amp; the Dominion's plot.\nDuring the &lt;a href=\"Interregnum\"&gt;Interregnum&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"2E%20582\"&gt;2E 582&lt;/a&gt;, the city-state of Stormhold had become the capital of Black Marsh, though most of the province was neutral and not a part of the Ebonheart Pact. The land surrounding the cities of Thorn and Gideon were considered territory of the Pact. Because of the troubled land, Stormhold was governed by three figures, each are Vicecanons of the Pact. Heita-Meen, &lt;a href=\"Hrondar\"&gt;Hrondar&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Servyna\"&gt;Servyna&lt;/a&gt; governed the land until the &lt;a href=\"Alliance%20War\"&gt;Alliance War&lt;/a&gt; had begun to reach the marshes of Shadowfen. The &lt;a href=\"First%20Aldmeri%20Dominion\"&gt;First Aldmeri Dominion&lt;/a&gt; under the command of &lt;a href=\"Ruuvitar\"&gt;Ruuvitar&lt;/a&gt; advanced onto the area with the intent of destroying the &lt;a href=\"Mnemic%20Egg\"&gt;Mnemic Egg&lt;/a&gt;, ending the next generation of Argonian hatchlings. Dominion Agents murdered citizens of Stormhold, causing the racial factions to turn against each other. The Dark Elves believed that the &lt;a href=\"Shadowscales\"&gt;Shadowscales&lt;/a&gt; were responsible for the murders, when in fact it was a different group. With the help of Shadowscales, an &lt;a href=\"Vestige\"&gt;Agent&lt;/a&gt; of the Pact was able to uncover &lt;a href=\"Skin-Stealers\"&gt;Skin-Stealers&lt;/a&gt;, people who use a vile concoction to take the appearance of the victim's heart. With the information in hand, the Shadowscales returned to the Deep Marsh and Vicecanon Hrondar disappeared. The Ebonheart Pact waged war with the Dominion, beginning with their redoubt in &lt;a href=\"Ten-Maur-Wolk\"&gt;Ten-Maur-Wolk&lt;/a&gt;.\n&lt;a href=\"Third%20Era\"&gt;Third Era&lt;/a&gt;.\nStormhold during the Imperial Simulacrum.\nDuring the &lt;a href=\"Imperial%20Simulacrum\"&gt;Imperial Simulacrum&lt;/a&gt; from &lt;a href=\"3E%20389\"&gt;3E 389&lt;/a&gt; to &lt;a href=\"3E%20399\"&gt;3E 399&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Emperor\"&gt;Emperor&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Uriel%20Septim%20VII\"&gt;Uriel Septim VII&lt;/a&gt; was imprisoned along with &lt;a href=\"Talin%20Warhaft\"&gt;Talin Warhaft&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;a href=\"Deadlands\"&gt;Deadlands&lt;/a&gt; by &lt;a href=\"Jagar%20Tharn\"&gt;Jagar Tharn&lt;/a&gt;. Tharn planned for months to capture the throne, and he was able to achieve so in ten years. Tharn had a powerful weapon called the &lt;a href=\"Staff%20of%20Chaos\"&gt;Staff of Chaos&lt;/a&gt;, and he split it into nine pieces and scattered them across Tamriel, the staff was the only thing keeping Uriel Septim and Warhaft in &lt;a href=\"Oblivion\"&gt;Oblivion&lt;/a&gt;. A warrior escaped his clutches and traveled all corners of Tamriel to retrieve the missing pieces. The hero was known as the &lt;a href=\"Eternal%20Champion\"&gt;Eternal Champion&lt;/a&gt;, and he assembled the staff and defeated Jagar Tharn at the &lt;a href=\"Imperial%20Palace\"&gt;Imperial Palace&lt;/a&gt;. The Eternal Champion had at one point visited the city of Stormhold in their quest to recover the pieces. The city of Stormhold was under the rule of &lt;a href=\"Queen%20Aphiana\"&gt;Queen Aphiana&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe Eternal Champion reached the city of Stormhold on their quest to find the seventh piece of the Staff. Through the visions of &lt;a href=\"Ria%20Silmane\"&gt;Ria Silmane&lt;/a&gt; and rumors from the people, the Champion had traveled to the northern borderlands, to the city of Stormhold in the province of Black Marsh. There the traveler ventured to the local &lt;a href=\"Conclave%20of%20Baal\"&gt;Conclave of Baal&lt;/a&gt; where they met &lt;a href=\"Idolan%20Lancaster\"&gt;Idolan Lancaster&lt;/a&gt;, the leader of the cult. Lancaster gives the Eternal Champion a proposition where if they retrieved a stone tablet from the &lt;a href=\"Vaults%20of%20Gemin%20%28Location%29\"&gt;Vaults of Gemin&lt;/a&gt;, then he would reveal the location of the piece. After finding the stone tablet in the ruins, Lancaster showed the way to &lt;a href=\"Murkwood\"&gt;Murkwood&lt;/a&gt;, a deadly forest within the center of the province. It was there that the Eternal Champion had obtained the seventh piece of the staff. The Champion had moved on to find the final piece of the staff somewhere in Northern Tamriel.\nUnknown era.\nVarus' folly &amp; the prison of Stormhold.\nThe Prison of Stormhold has held an infamous reputation throughout the Empire, due to the insanity that was the warden, &lt;a href=\"Quintus%20Varus\"&gt;Quintus Varus&lt;/a&gt;. The caverns of Stormhold Prison holds powerful crystals that Warden Varus wants to use to end the corruption and vileness within the Empire. Rumor has it that the overseers and prisoners had gone mad, killing workers that were digging the caves. This had lasted for quite some time until a prisoner known as the &lt;a href=\"Master%20Tunnel%20Rat\"&gt;Master Tunnel Rat&lt;/a&gt; had begun to rise throughout the prisoner's hierarchy, forming alliances with the fellow prisoners and workers. Eventually, Quintus Varus had uncovered the &lt;a href=\"Stormhold%20Crystal\"&gt;Stormhold Crystal&lt;/a&gt;, which was the ultimate prize, to begin with. Before he could retrieve the Crystal, he was stopped by the Master Tunnel Rat and killed. With the Warden dead, the prisoners escaped the prison and ending the Warden's reign over Stormhold Prison.\nTrivia.\nIn an earlier stage of development, \"Arena\" was going to be a tournament-based game, where each city had their own gladiatorial team. Stormhold's team was known as the Black Shields."}

Indeed, it was these coastal tracts, where Tamriel's delinquents once freely roamed, that were changed into barely habitable prison settlements. It is not surprising, then, that a separate but comparable history of indenture exists elsewhere in this great morass: &lt;a href=\"Stormhold%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Stormhold&lt;/a&gt;.\nFounded by the Barsaebic &lt;a href=\"Ayleid\"&gt;Ayleid&lt;/a&gt;s before parchment records were kept, Stormhold holds the infamous history of the &lt;a href=\"Dunmer%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Dark Elf&lt;/a&gt;.

In this volume, I explore the death rites of the &lt;a href=\"Orsimer%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Orsimer&lt;/a&gt;\u2014otherwise known as the Orcs of &lt;a href=\"Wrothgar%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Wrothgar&lt;/a&gt;.\nPopular lore would have us believe that Orc's remains lay where they fall. While there is grain of truth in this concept, Orcs know as much about disease and decay as any of the other intelligent races. No one wants a rotting corpse attract all kinds of insects and predators. So, while the spot where an Orc dies is marked and considered almost sacred by his brethren, the body is not left in place for more than a few hours. During this time friends and family come to pay their last respects. Then the body is removed\u2014to where, I cannot say.\nOrcs, for all their oral traditions, refuse to provide explanations or specifics to outsiders. I have had to make educated guesses based upon observations and the few conversations I've been able to engage in. But so far, no one will tell me what the Orcs do with the bodies of the dead.\nI discovered an ancient Orcish burial site, the mountain known as &lt;a href=\"Sorrow\"&gt;Sorrow&lt;/a&gt;. This snow-covered peak, full of dangerous creatures and deadly weather, served as a depository for dead Orcs for several generations, though the practice ended abruptly sometime in the past. Apparently, the mountain was reserved for only the bravest and strongest Orcs, who were required to climb as high as they could before death finally overtook them. These Orcs were left where they fell, but stones were piled atop their bodies to form protective claims or unique constructions called wedge tombs.\nThis also appears to have some connection to the practise of marking any location where an Orc dies and falls with a sacred rock. They call the rocks \"tumnors,\" which I believe means \"death stones\" in the Orcish tongue.\nI finally found an old Orc female who was willing to share some of their death rituals with me. Specifically, she was willing to discuss the practice of \"beshkar-nor,\" the death-forge.\nApparently, what happens to the bodies of Orcs of great stature\u2014leaders, heroes, and revered elders\u2014is that they undergo a process known as the death-forge. The old Orc described the process in confusing terms. I'm not sure if the blood is drained from the body and saved for later use or if the entire body is burned and reduced to ash, and then the ash is saved. Either way, the saved remains wind up mixed into molten metal, allowing the revered Orc to become one with a powerful tool or weapon, usually a sword, hammer, or shield.\nSo, my quest to completely understand the complex funerary rites practised by the Orcs of Wrothgar continues. I've learned so much, but I realize I haven't really learned anything at all. I know, as general rule, the Orcs don't bury their dead\u2014except when they do, such as the mountain of Sorrow. I know that they mark the place where a powerful Orc died, but they probably don't actually leave the body there to rot and decay. And I learned that some portion of a dead Orc is saved to mix with a newly forged tool or weapon in process known as the death-forge.\nI'll continue to probe and investigate, for I find these contradictory practises to be fascinating. I just hope I don't anger the wrong Orc and learn about their death rituals first hand. That wouldn't do at all."}

A character's maximum &lt;a href=\"Encumbrance\"&gt;Encumbrance&lt;/a&gt; (weight that can be carried) is calculated by multiplying Strength by five.

Strength is also one of four factors that are summed to determine maximum &lt;a href=\"Fatigue\"&gt;Fatigue&lt;/a&gt;. Increasing maximum Fatigue allows a character to engage in strenuous activities such as &lt;a href=\"running\"&gt;running&lt;/a&gt; or fighting for longer periods of time.\nCombat.\nStrength is taken into account when calculating the amount of &lt;a href=\"Damage%20%28Morrowind%29\"&gt;damage&lt;/a&gt; inflicted upon others with both &lt;a href=\"melee\"&gt;melee&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Marksman%20%28Morrowind%29\"&gt;ranged&lt;/a&gt; weapons.

Fifty Strength is the break-even point for the damage multiplier used during armed combat calculations; a character with less than fifty Strength will experience a reduction in the amount of damage inflicted per hit, while a character with more than fifty Strength will experience an increase in the amount of damage dealt.\nA character with high Strength experiences two side-effects during armed combat due to the increased damage output: A higher chance of staggering opponents, and an increased rate of weapon deterioration.\nSkills.\nThe following &lt;a href=\"Skills%20%28Morrowind%29\"&gt;skills&lt;/a&gt; are governed by Strength.

You will have to face off against some corrupted &lt;a href=\"Imp%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Imps&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Lurcher%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Lurchers&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Spriggan%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Spriggans&lt;/a&gt; though. Once you have made it through to the other side, enter the Grotto and begin your search for Naemon's Shade. \nApproaching the door across from the entraance will cause Indaenir to realise that it has been blocked with magic, but that the pedestals in the room are still active. Talk to him and he will tell you that this is the door to the Valenheart, the heart of Valenwood. Naemon sealed it with ancient Ayleid magic, but if you retrieve the keystones that go along with the pedestals, you will be able to unseal the door. \nThe Armory Keystone is through the hallway to the north, in the armory. It is at the end of the furthest hallway. Take it, and you will be taken out of the Shadow Wood and back into the regular Hectahame; the spirits you have been seeing so far that were non-hostile will become hostile &lt;a href=\"Veiled%20Heritance\"&gt;Veiled Heritance&lt;/a&gt; members. Fight your way through, back to Indaenir, and place the keystone on its pedestal. You can now talk to Indaenir to return to the Shadow Realm so that you can look for the other keystones there. The Ritual Keystone is in the Ritual Chambers to the east, and the Arboretum Keystone is in the Arboretum to the south. Both are all the way at the end of the hallways, and both of them will cast you back out of the Shadow Realm; Indaenir will pull you back in. \nOnce you have placed all three keystones, Indaenir will unseal the door. Head in and you will find the Shade of Naemon in there, ready for battle. He is quite powerful, and will summon Lurchers and Skeletons to his aid, so be prepared. Once he is dead, take the Staff of Magnus from his body and then speak with Indaenir. He will say that while the Shade is gone, the corruption in the Heart still remains, and may well infect parts of Valenwood. He will try to cure it by drawing the corruption out of the Heart and into himself. This will work, but Indaenir will die in the process. \nAfter Indaenir's death, Mane Akkuz-ri and &lt;a href=\"Cariel\"&gt;Cariel&lt;/a&gt; will show up. Speak with the Mane and explain what has happened. As you are doing so, something strange will happen to Indaenir's body; the Green is bringing him back to life. Cariel will exclaim that this means Indaenir has been chosen; he is to be the new &lt;a href=\"Silvenar%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Silvenar&lt;/a&gt;. Talk to Indaenir about all this and he will accept his new role. You should now go outside and inform the Queen of this. You can also talk to &lt;a href=\"Razum-dar%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Razum-dar&lt;/a&gt; in the Grotto, as well as to the Mane, who has headed to the Queen's side. Once you talk to the Queen, she will take the staff or magnus from you. Indaenir will show up just as you tell her of this new role; a conversation will follow where Ayrenn bows down to Indaenir and recognises him as the new leader of the Bosmer people. \nSpeak with Ayrenn again to finish the quest and start the next one, \"&lt;a href=\"To%20Velyn%20Harbor\"&gt;To Velyn Harbor&lt;/a&gt;.\""}

I can think of no other reason for this particular layout. Perhaps this group oversaw this particular portion of the city?

{"id": "2464", "revid": "55168199", "url": "https://elderscrolls.fandom.com/wiki?curid=2464", "title": "Stros M'Kai", "text": "Stros M'Kai (&lt;a href=\"Yoku\"&gt;Yoku&lt;/a&gt;: Sanloa M'Kai/Sister of Thought) is an island territory located on the eastern &lt;a href=\"Abecean%20Sea\"&gt;Abecean Sea&lt;/a&gt; near the mainland regions of &lt;a href=\"Khefrem\"&gt;Khefrem&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Hew%27s%20Bane\"&gt;Hew's Bane&lt;/a&gt;. The island has been important to the Kingdoms of &lt;a href=\"Hammerfell\"&gt;Hammerfell&lt;/a&gt; as well as the &lt;a href=\"Empire\"&gt;Empire&lt;/a&gt;s of &lt;a href=\"Cyrodiil\"&gt;Cyrodiil&lt;/a&gt;.\nDescription.\nGeography.\nStros M'Kai is one of the smallest islands owned by Hammerfell, and it is behind other territories such as &lt;a href=\"Herne%20%28Island%29\"&gt;Herne&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Cespar\"&gt;Cespar&lt;/a&gt; in size. But what Stros M'Kai has an advantage on is its proximity to the mainland and the former capital of Hammerfell, &lt;a href=\"Hegathe\"&gt;Hegathe&lt;/a&gt;, which is located north of the island on Khefrem. Stros M'Kai is heavily shrouded in sandy dunes and the rugged &lt;a href=\"Ogres%20Tooth%20Mountains\"&gt;Ogres Tooth Mountains&lt;/a&gt; which are on the western end of the Isle. The capital of &lt;a href=\"Port%20Hunding\"&gt;Port Hunding&lt;/a&gt; is the located on large ravines that divide the city from the Palace. The river flows through Stros M'Kai and splits the main island into two. &lt;a href=\"Hunding%20Bay\"&gt;Hunding Bay&lt;/a&gt; refers to the large opening in central Stros M'Kai that has the &lt;a href=\"Island%20of%20Iron%20Faces\"&gt;Island of Iron Faces&lt;/a&gt; and the Statue to &lt;a href=\"Frandar%20Hunding\"&gt;Frandar Hunding&lt;/a&gt; on it. Northwest of Stros M'Kai is &lt;a href=\"the%20Spine\"&gt;the Spine&lt;/a&gt;, a small archipelago of small jagged islands that are largely uninhabitable. Off the coast of the main island and the Spine is an island colloquially known as the &lt;a href=\"Isle%20of%20N%27Gasta\"&gt;Isle of N'Gasta&lt;/a&gt;. It was the home of the elusive &lt;a href=\"Sload\"&gt;Sload&lt;/a&gt; race of &lt;a href=\"Beastfolk\"&gt;Beastfolk&lt;/a&gt; that haunt the &lt;a href=\"Abecean%20Sea\"&gt;Abecean Sea&lt;/a&gt;.\nFauna.\nAssassin Beetle.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Assassin%20Beetle\"&gt;Assassin Beetle&lt;/a&gt; or the Samara Scarabs back in &lt;a href=\"Yokuda\"&gt;Yokuda&lt;/a&gt;, are a dangerous type of insectoid found in the deserts of Stros M'Kai and the &lt;a href=\"Alik%27r%20Desert\"&gt;Alik'r Desert&lt;/a&gt;. These beetles are more commonly found in the Ogres Tooth Mountains and the outer ruins of Bthzark on the island. The Assassin Beetle shares a striking resemblance to its electrifying &lt;a href=\"Thunderbug\"&gt;cousins&lt;/a&gt; of the southern Tamriel Coast and their fiery &lt;a href=\"Shalk\"&gt;brethren&lt;/a&gt; of the &lt;a href=\"Morrowind\"&gt;Morrowind&lt;/a&gt; Ashlands. They have a black endoskeleton that helps them blend into the shadows; this is likely the reason why they tend to live near the mountains. Killing an Assassin Beetle can be tricky since their blood is laced with acid, which can burn the skin quickly.\nWolves.\n&lt;a href=\"Wolves\"&gt;Wolves&lt;/a&gt; are found more in Stros M'Kai then in places such as the &lt;a href=\"Alik%27r%20Desert\"&gt;Alik'r Desert&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"Craglorn\"&gt;Craglorn&lt;/a&gt;. Wolves tend to live on the central coasts of Stros M'Kai, on the Hunding Bay. Wolves travel in packs and attack all at once. Sometimes they will move in different directions to confuse their prey and catch them off guard. Despite their substantial numbers, a wolf is not hard to take down.\nDwarven Animunculi.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Dwemer\"&gt;Dwemer&lt;/a&gt; have ancient cities located all across northern Tamriel in places such as &lt;a href=\"Red%20Mountain\"&gt;Red Mountain&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"The%20Reach\"&gt;eastern Reach&lt;/a&gt;, and the &lt;a href=\"Wrothgarian%20Mountains\"&gt;Wrothgarian Mountains&lt;/a&gt;. The Dwarves hold secrets that are sought out by the spheres of influence in Tamriel, and they must protect their secrets by any means necessary. They built giant contraptions that roam the halls of Bthzark such as the &lt;a href=\"Dwarven%20Spider\"&gt;Dwarven Spider&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"Dwarven%20Sphere\"&gt;Dwarven Sphere&lt;/a&gt;, and the &lt;a href=\"Dwarven%20Centurion\"&gt;Dwarven Centurion&lt;/a&gt;. Many people do not make it out of Bthzark because the machinations fight valiantly for their long gone creators. The Dwarven Spider is a spider-like machine that conducts electricity that can be passed onto other robots. The Dwarven Sphere is a large machine that uses a sphere to move around, and they have arms resembling Swords and Crossbows. The Dwarven Centurion is a giant machine that blows incredibly hot steam and can demolish a building in a single swing.\nDurzogs.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Durzog\"&gt;Durzog&lt;/a&gt; is a strange creature that resembles a combination of a feral &lt;a href=\"Argonian\"&gt;Argonian&lt;/a&gt; and a rabid dog. Durzogs are lizard dogs that have long spiked spines and pale green skin that gives them a wild look to them. They have a large jaw with immense teeth that can bite off the head of anyone. Their hides are riddled with barbs and such that make them hard to fight actually. Durzogs are commonly used as battle pets for Goblins since they tend to live in the same area. Durzogs can be found in the northern mountains of Stros M'Kai near Goblin Camps or by the coast of the island or the rivers.\nGoblins.\n&lt;a href=\"Goblin\"&gt;Goblin&lt;/a&gt;s are a barbaric folk that lives practically everywhere, from &lt;a href=\"Morrowind\"&gt;Morrowind&lt;/a&gt; to the &lt;a href=\"Summerset%20Isles\"&gt;Summerset Isles&lt;/a&gt;. Goblins live in tribes, but there is only one tribe to exist on Stros M'Kai, the &lt;a href=\"Dogeater%20Tribe\"&gt;Dogeater Tribe&lt;/a&gt;. The Tribe has lived all through the second era in the northern mountains of the island and have the northern region under their grasp. The Dogeaters have built large caves that extend throughout the hills. The Dogeaters use Durzogs as reliable battle pets for taking out travelers from Port Hunding to &lt;a href=\"Saintsport\"&gt;Saintsport&lt;/a&gt;. Goblins make makeshift weapons and can easily outnumber unaware passersby.\nFlora.\nStros M'Kai is largely a desert biome with some levels of vegetation found throughout the island. Thin patches of grass can be found throughout the Hunding Bay as well as in Port Hunding. Desert plants such as , desert shrubs, and small cactuses can be found in small pockets in the desert and decent quantities on the coast. Stros M'Kai tends to have imported goods from the mainland, so the people do not tend to any plant farms. The Ogres Tooth Mountains have small areas of plants that grow along the base. Plants such as the &lt;a href=\"Mountain%20Flower\"&gt;Mountain Flower&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"Wormwood\"&gt;Wormwood&lt;/a&gt; grow in this area while plants such as the &lt;a href=\"Water%20Hyacinth\"&gt;Water Hyacinth&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"Nirnroot\"&gt;Nirnroot&lt;/a&gt;, and the &lt;a href=\"Columbine\"&gt;Columbine&lt;/a&gt; grow on the sea and waterways. One of the rarest roots found in Western Tamriel is the &lt;a href=\"Jarrin%20Root\"&gt;Jarrin Root&lt;/a&gt;, these roots are found in the shadows of Stros M'Kai and can be made into a deadly poison. They are rare to come across and can be mixed into any food without anyone suspecting a thing. According to some archives, the &lt;a href=\"Dark%20Brotherhood\"&gt;Dark Brotherhood&lt;/a&gt; of Skyrim planned on using Jarrin Root to poison &lt;a href=\"Emperor\"&gt;Emperor&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Titus%20Mede%20II\"&gt;Titus Mede II&lt;/a&gt;. It has been shown that Stros M'Kai produces Rum that is exported to places such as &lt;a href=\"Solitude\"&gt;Solitude&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Wayrest\"&gt;Wayrest&lt;/a&gt;. This means that Stros M'Kai must grow an abundant amount of to produce a lot of Rum and to receive critical acclaim.\nGovernment.\nThe isle of Stros M'Kai is referred to as a kingdom along with the cities of &lt;a href=\"Hegathe\"&gt;Hegathe&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Elinhir\"&gt;Elinhir&lt;/a&gt;, and it is the property of &lt;a href=\"the%20Crowns\"&gt;the Crowns&lt;/a&gt;, one of the two political parties that exist in Hammerfell. The Crowns, compared to &lt;a href=\"the%20Forebears\"&gt;the Forebears&lt;/a&gt;, kept the traditions that the &lt;a href=\"Na-Totambu\"&gt;Na-Totambu&lt;/a&gt; have preserved from the continent of &lt;a href=\"Yokuda\"&gt;Yokuda&lt;/a&gt;. During the &lt;a href=\"Tiber%20Wars\"&gt;Tiber Wars&lt;/a&gt;, the ruler of the island was &lt;a href=\"Prince%20A%27Tor\"&gt;Prince A'Tor&lt;/a&gt;, the son of &lt;a href=\"High%20King\"&gt;High King&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Thassad%20II\"&gt;Thassad II&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"Sentinel\"&gt;Sentinel&lt;/a&gt;. A'Tor was a valiant warrior during the &lt;a href=\"Conquest%20of%20Hammerfell\"&gt;Conquest of Hammerfell&lt;/a&gt; and passed during the &lt;a href=\"Battle%20of%20Hunding%20Bay\"&gt;Battle of Hunding Bay&lt;/a&gt;. A'Tor could have been considered the king of Stros M'Kai, but at the time, he was referred to as a prince. After the battle, the &lt;a href=\"Septim%20Empire\"&gt;Septim Empire&lt;/a&gt; issued a provisional government to re-establish order on the island. &lt;a href=\"Admiral%20Amiel%20Richton\"&gt;Admiral Amiel Richton&lt;/a&gt; was named Provisional Governor of the island and ruled the island with an iron fist up until &lt;a href=\"2E%20864\"&gt;2E 864&lt;/a&gt; where he was assassinated. The &lt;a href=\"First%20Treaty%20of%20Stros%20M%27Kai\"&gt;First Treaty of Stros M'Kai&lt;/a&gt; created an agreement between the Crowns and the Empire, Stros M'Kai was a Kingdom of the Third Empire. The Imperial Legion guarded the island and had a garrison stationed in Port Hunding. Saintsport is independent of the city, but they still have a substantial relationship.\nReligion.\nBecause of Hammerfell's integration into the Septim Empire, Port Hunding is required to have a temple dedicated to the &lt;a href=\"Nine%20Divines\"&gt;Nine Divines&lt;/a&gt;. Through some unknown method, Port Hunding and the Kingdom of Stros M'Kai was given &lt;a href=\"Arkay\"&gt;Arkay&lt;/a&gt; to worship over. The &lt;a href=\"Temple%20of%20Arkay%20%28Redguard%29\"&gt;Temple of Arkay&lt;/a&gt; is located on the south-central end of the city near the town square. Arkay is the God and Governor of the Circle Life, meaning he represents life and death in Tamriel. Arkay has Temples all across Tamriel in places such as &lt;a href=\"County%20Cheydinhal\"&gt;County Cheydinhal&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Falkreath\"&gt;Kingdom of Falkreath&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Sentinel\"&gt;Kingdom of Sentinel&lt;/a&gt;, and the &lt;a href=\"Barony%20of%20the%20Ilessan%20Hills\"&gt;Barony of the Ilessan Hills&lt;/a&gt;.\nWhile the city-folk worship Arkay of the Nine Divines, many Redguards worship &lt;a href=\"Morwha\"&gt;Morwha&lt;/a&gt; of the &lt;a href=\"Redguard%20Pantheon\"&gt;Redguard Pantheon&lt;/a&gt;. Morwha is described as the God of Fertility and is commonly associated with &lt;a href=\"Mara\"&gt;Mara&lt;/a&gt; of the Nine Divines.\nHistory.\n&lt;a href=\"Second%20Era\"&gt;Second Era&lt;/a&gt;.\nMarooned on Stros M'Kai; Assembling the Spearhead.\nBefore becoming the hero of the &lt;a href=\"Daggerfall%20Covenant\"&gt;Daggerfall Covenant&lt;/a&gt; and the liberator of the &lt;a href=\"Bangkorai%20Garrison\"&gt;Bangkorai Garrison&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"Vestige\"&gt;Vestige&lt;/a&gt; was marooned on the Isle of Stros M'Kai after escaping &lt;a href=\"Coldharbour\"&gt;Coldharbour&lt;/a&gt; and falling into the &lt;a href=\"Abecean%20Sea\"&gt;Abecean Sea&lt;/a&gt;. The Vestige met with &lt;a href=\"Captain%20Kaleen\"&gt;Captain Kaleen&lt;/a&gt; of \"&lt;a href=\"The%20Spearhead\"&gt;The Spearhead&lt;/a&gt;\" who planned on leaving for &lt;a href=\"Betnikh\"&gt;Betnikh&lt;/a&gt; to bring the &lt;a href=\"Seamount%20Clan\"&gt;Seamount Clan&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"Orsimer\"&gt;Orsimer&lt;/a&gt; into the &lt;a href=\"Daggerfall%20Covenant\"&gt;Daggerfall Covenant&lt;/a&gt;. She needed experienced crew members situated on Stros M'Kai to make the journey and to have a sustainable team to keep around in here travels. She sent the Vestige to find &lt;a href=\"Jakarn\"&gt;Jakarn&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Crafty%20Lerisa\"&gt;Crafty Lerisa&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Neramo\"&gt;Neramo&lt;/a&gt; all of whom are located in different parts of Stros M'Kai. Jakarn was in &lt;a href=\"The%20Goblin%20Caves%20%28Location%29\"&gt;The Goblin Caves&lt;/a&gt; on the northern island, Crafty Lerisa was in &lt;a href=\"Saintsport\"&gt;Saintsport&lt;/a&gt;, and Neramo was in &lt;a href=\"Bthzark\"&gt;Bthzark&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;a href=\"Ogres%20Tooth%20Mountains\"&gt;Ogres Tooth Mountains&lt;/a&gt;. After gathering the team, Kaleen needed &lt;a href=\"Headman%20Bhosek\"&gt;Headman Bhosek&lt;/a&gt; to be killed leave Stros M'Kai safety. With everyone's combined skills, Bhosek was assassinated and the people of Stros M'Kai was freed from Bhosek's reign. The crew of \"The Spearhead\" set sailed for Betnikh.\nThe Battle of Hunding Bay; The Rise of Tiber Septim.\nIn &lt;a href=\"2E%20854\"&gt;2E 854&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"King%20Cuhlecain\"&gt;King Cuhlecain&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"Falkreath\"&gt;Falkreath&lt;/a&gt; was assassinated by a &lt;a href=\"Breton\"&gt;Breton&lt;/a&gt;\n&lt;a href=\"Nightblade\"&gt;Nightblade&lt;/a&gt; from the &lt;a href=\"Western%20Reach\"&gt;Western Reach&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Cyrodiil\"&gt;Seat of Sundered Kings&lt;/a&gt; needed a new emperor to rule over the &lt;a href=\"Colovian%20West\"&gt;Colovian West&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Nibenay\"&gt;Nibenese East&lt;/a&gt;. Cuhlecain's prized general assumed the throne and began a conquest throughout &lt;a href=\"Tamriel\"&gt;Tamriel&lt;/a&gt;, his name was &lt;a href=\"Tiber%20Septim\"&gt;Tiber Septim&lt;/a&gt;. Hammerfell at the time was ruled by &lt;a href=\"Thassad%20II\"&gt;High King Thassad II&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"the%20Crowns\"&gt;the Crowns&lt;/a&gt; who passed away in &lt;a href=\"2E%20862\"&gt;2E 862&lt;/a&gt;. The city of &lt;a href=\"Sentinel\"&gt;Sentinel&lt;/a&gt; was under the rule of the Crowns until Thassad's death when &lt;a href=\"the%20Forebears\"&gt;the Forebears&lt;/a&gt; led by &lt;a href=\"Baron%20Volag\"&gt;Baron Volag&lt;/a&gt; retook Sentinel by force and prevented &lt;a href=\"Crown%20Prince%20A%27Tor\"&gt;Crown Prince A'Tor&lt;/a&gt; from assuming the throne. A'Tor would travel from Stros M'Kai to Sentinel and committed one of the bloodiest massacres in Tamrielic History.\nThis conflict caused a &lt;a href=\"Tiber%20Wars\"&gt;civil war&lt;/a&gt; between the two political factions in Hammerfell, and it slowly fell into the Crowns' favor. The Forebear took serious measures in this war by asking Tiber Septim for his aid in the battle in exchange for Hammerfell's allegiance into the &lt;a href=\"Third%20Empire\"&gt;Third Empire&lt;/a&gt;. Stros M'Kai and &lt;a href=\"Port%20Hunding\"&gt;Port Hunding&lt;/a&gt; became the Crowns' headquarters in the Civil War while the Forebears had the city of Sentinel and the &lt;a href=\"Alik%27r%20Desert\"&gt;Alik'r Desert&lt;/a&gt;. Many Crowns loyalists deserted A'Tor and joined the Forebears when they realized what the Septim Empire would give to Hammerfell. This caused a sudden flux in Crowns numbers and the battlefront being pushed into the &lt;a href=\"Abecean%20Sea\"&gt;Abecean Sea&lt;/a&gt; and eventually into Stros M'Kai waters. The final battle in the Civil War was the &lt;a href=\"Battle%20of%20Hunding%20Bay\"&gt;Battle of Hunding Bay&lt;/a&gt; and it left Stros M'Kai in a state of woe. The Septim Navy was led by &lt;a href=\"Admiral%20Amiel%20Richton\"&gt;Admiral Amiel Richton&lt;/a&gt; while the Crowns were led by Prince A'Tor. Richton utilized the dragon known as &lt;a href=\"Nafaalilargus\"&gt;Nafaalilargus&lt;/a&gt; to burn down the Crown fleets, A'Tor died honorable in combat and Stros M'Kai was captured, by Richton. Hammerfell fell to the Imperials of Cyrodiil.\nThe Restless Revolution; Enter Cyrus the Restless.\nIn the aftermath of the battle, Hammerfell was heavily oppressed by the Third Empire, and Stros M'Kai was no exception. Admiral Richton was named Provisional Governor of Stros M'Kai, and Imperial Garrisons were built in every city found throughout Hammerfell. In &lt;a href=\"2E%20864\"&gt;2E 864&lt;/a&gt;, a pirate that was known as &lt;a href=\"Cyrus%20%28Redguard%29\"&gt;Cyrus&lt;/a&gt; arrived into Stros M'Kai to find his sister, &lt;a href=\"Iszara\"&gt;Iszara&lt;/a&gt;, who disappeared sometime after the Battle of Hunding Bay. Cyrus did a couple of odd jobs here and there until he accepted a position to retrieve the Amulet of N'Gasta on an &lt;a href=\"Isle%20of%20N%27Gasta\"&gt;island&lt;/a&gt; off the coast of Stros M'Kai. After bringing the Amulet to Amiel Richton, he was double-crossed and put into &lt;a href=\"The%20Grave\"&gt;The Grave&lt;/a&gt; to be imprisoned.\nCyrus escaped the Grave sometime afterward with the knowledge on how to contact the &lt;a href=\"Restless%20League\"&gt;Restless League&lt;/a&gt; of Pirates and the key to &lt;a href=\"Saintsport%27s%20Lighthouse\"&gt;Saintsport's Lighthouse&lt;/a&gt;. Cyrus returned to Port Hunding to learn more about how to contact the Restless League. He met &lt;a href=\"Urik\"&gt;Urik&lt;/a&gt;, who gave Cyrus the League's Insignia while &lt;a href=\"Erasmo\"&gt;Erasmo&lt;/a&gt; gave him a code that is also required to attend the League. Cyrus traveled to Saintsport and signaled the Restless League, he was eventually taken to the League's headquarters and met the leader of the group, &lt;a href=\"Basil%20%28Character%29\"&gt;Basil&lt;/a&gt;. With Basil's help, Cyrus unlocked Iszara's Lodge and found out her plan to revive Prince A'Tor to continue the fight. Cyrus returns to the Isle of N'Gasta to see if he knew anything. Cyrus discovered N'Gasta with Iszara's body and defeated him using the &lt;a href=\"Flask%20of%20Lillandril\"&gt;Flask of Lillandril&lt;/a&gt;. Cyrus entered &lt;a href=\"Oblivion\"&gt;Oblivion&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"The%20Fields%20of%20Regret\"&gt;The Fields of Regret&lt;/a&gt; to follow Iszara. Cyrus met &lt;a href=\"Clavicus%20Vile\"&gt;Clavicus Vile&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Barbas\"&gt;Barbas&lt;/a&gt; in the Oblivion Plane and wagered his soul for Iszara's Soul. Cyrus was able to outsmart Vile and saved his sister. Their next objective was to retrieve the &lt;a href=\"Soul%20Gem\"&gt;Soul Gem&lt;/a&gt; with Prince A'Tor's soul.\nPrince A'Tor's Soul Gem is kept in the Palace Treasury in Port Hunding. Entering from the outside would be a death sentence, so Cyrus entered the Palace via the Grave. After defeating several guards, he finally arrived into the Treasury, but it was guarded by a giant red dragon known as &lt;a href=\"Nafaalilargus\"&gt;Nafaalilargus&lt;/a&gt;. In a heated battle, Cyrus defeated the Dragon and retrieved the Soul Gem. Afterward, Cyrus met with Iszara and a Yokudan Gypsy named &lt;a href=\"Saban\"&gt;Saban&lt;/a&gt; at a camp outside of the city. The three traveled to A'Tor's sarcophagus and infused his soul with a steel longsword now known as the &lt;a href=\"Soul%20Sword\"&gt;Soul Sword&lt;/a&gt;. With this great blade, Cyrus confronted Amiel Richton and his assassin, &lt;a href=\"Dram\"&gt;Dram&lt;/a&gt; at the Port Hunding Palace. Cyrus killed Dram and defeated Richton, who was on a &lt;a href=\"Dwemer\"&gt;Dwemer&lt;/a&gt; Airship. Stros M'Kai was liberated from the oppressive Amiel Richton and through A'Tor's advice, the &lt;a href=\"Treaty%20of%20Stros%20M%27kai\"&gt;First Treaty of Stros M'Kai&lt;/a&gt; was created between Iszara and &lt;a href=\"Tiber%20Septim\"&gt;Tiber Septim&lt;/a&gt;. Hammerfell's rights were not so restricted, and the province fully accepted its integration into the Third Empire. Cyrus left Stros M'Kai to further explore the lands of Tamriel, some say he traveled to &lt;a href=\"Black%20Marsh\"&gt;Black Marsh&lt;/a&gt; to find the legendary &lt;a href=\"Eye%20of%20Argonia%20%28Artifact%29\"&gt;Eye of Argonia&lt;/a&gt;.\n&lt;a href=\"Fourth%20Era\"&gt;Fourth Era&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe Epilogue &amp; The Second Treaty of Stros M'Kai.\nOn the 30th of &lt;a href=\"Frostfall\"&gt;Frostfall&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"4E%20171\"&gt;4E 171&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"Third%20Aldmeri%20Dominion\"&gt;Third Aldmeri Dominion&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"Alinor\"&gt;Alinor&lt;/a&gt; gave &lt;a href=\"Emperor\"&gt;Emperor&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Titus%20Mede%20II\"&gt;Titus Mede II&lt;/a&gt; an ultimatum that demanded tributes, the banning of &lt;a href=\"Talos\"&gt;Talos&lt;/a&gt; worship throughout the &lt;a href=\"Mede%20Empire\"&gt;Mede Empire&lt;/a&gt;, and large sections of southern &lt;a href=\"Hammerfell\"&gt;Hammerfell&lt;/a&gt;. Mede naturally rejected these terms and the &lt;a href=\"Great%20War\"&gt;Great War&lt;/a&gt; commenced. The Dominion invaded the shores of the south of Hammerfell and the borders of the south of &lt;a href=\"Cyrodiil\"&gt;Cyrodiil&lt;/a&gt;, entering the regions of &lt;a href=\"Khefrem\"&gt;Khefrem&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Blackwood\"&gt;Blackwood&lt;/a&gt;. The War left the Imperial Province in shambles, and multiple cities were sacked by the Dominion led by both &lt;a href=\"Lord%20Naarifin\"&gt;Lord Naarifin&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Lady%20Arannelya\"&gt;Lady Arannelya&lt;/a&gt;. In &lt;a href=\"4E%20175\"&gt;4E 175&lt;/a&gt;, the Dominion armies moved to the &lt;a href=\"Heartlands\"&gt;Heartlands&lt;/a&gt; of Cyrodiil to capture the &lt;a href=\"Imperial%20City\"&gt;Imperial City&lt;/a&gt;. After the gruesome &lt;a href=\"Battle%20of%20the%20Red%20Ring\"&gt;Battle of the Red Ring&lt;/a&gt;, the Dominion marched past &lt;a href=\"Weye\"&gt;Weye&lt;/a&gt; and the gates of the Imperial City, this battle was known as &lt;a href=\"Sack%20of%20the%20Imperial%20City\"&gt;Sack of the Imperial City&lt;/a&gt;. The War ended when Titus Mede II was forced to sign the &lt;a href=\"White-Gold%20Concordat\"&gt;White-Gold Concordat&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Redguards\"&gt;Redguards&lt;/a&gt; of Hammerfell were furious with the signing of the White-Gold Concordat, they seceded from the Mede Empire, and they continued the fight throughout Hammerfell. The war continued for another five years while Cyrodiil tries their hardest to rebuild from the destruction. Southern Hammerfell was completely decimated, although the total amount of damage is known, it can be assumed that cities such as &lt;a href=\"Abah%27s%20Landing\"&gt;Abah's Landing&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Hegathe\"&gt;Hegathe&lt;/a&gt; were severely damage and repairing them would take a lot of time. The War ended with the &lt;a href=\"Second%20Treaty%20of%20Stros%20M%27kai\"&gt;Second Treaty of Stros M'kai&lt;/a&gt; that was signed in &lt;a href=\"4E%20180\"&gt;4E 180&lt;/a&gt;."}

The zone guide provides clues as to the location of each Skyshard, but many can be found simply by exploring and watching for the distinctive pillar of light they emit. Skyshards will appear on the map and compass when the Vestige is close to one and will remain discovered on the map even if it was not collected.\nAchievements.\nAchievements can be earned by completing specific tasks such as completing quests and discovering locations. Achievements are separated into categories and their progress is viewable from the journal. Earning achievement provides the Vestige a number of points, and some achievements unlock unique rewards such as &lt;a href=\"Furnishings%20%28Online%29\"&gt;furnishings&lt;/a&gt; that can be bought from Achievement Furnishers or &lt;a href=\"collectibles\"&gt;collectibles&lt;/a&gt;.\nShalidor's Library.\nOne book that is a part of Shalidor's Library can be found in Stros M'Kai and added to the collection.

I was stationed at the Sphinxmoth Legion Fort on the border near &lt;a href=\"Dune\"&gt;Dune&lt;/a&gt;\u00a0and witnessed many of the northern skirmishes firsthand.\nThe war started with the so-called \"&lt;a href=\"Slaughter%20of%20Torval\"&gt;Slaughter of Torval&lt;/a&gt;.\" The Khajiit claim that the Bosmer invaded the city without provocation and killed over a thousand citizens before being driven off by reinforcements from a nearby jungle tribe. The &lt;a href=\"Bosmer\"&gt;Bosmer&lt;/a&gt; claim that the attack was in retaliation for &lt;a href=\"A%20Dance%20in%20Fire%2C%20Book%20I\"&gt;Khajiti bandits who were attacking wood caravans headed for Valenwood&lt;/a&gt;.\nIn the spring of &lt;a href=\"3E%20396\"&gt;3E 396&lt;/a&gt; the war moved closer to &lt;a href=\"Fort%20Sphinxmoth\"&gt;Fort Sphinxmoth&lt;/a&gt;. I was posted on lookout and saw parts of the conflict. I later spoke with both Khajiit and Bosmer who fought in the battle, and it will serve as an excellent example of how the Khajiit used a mixture of ground and tree units to win the war.\nThe Khajiit began the fight in an unusual way by sending tree-cutting teams of &lt;a href=\"Cathay-raht\"&gt;Cathay-raht&lt;/a&gt; and the fearsome &lt;a href=\"Senche-raht\"&gt;Senche-raht&lt;/a&gt; or \"Battlecats\" into the outskirts of Valenwood's forests. When word reached the Bosmer that trees were being felled (allegedly a &lt;a href=\"Green%20Pact\"&gt;crime&lt;/a&gt; in the strange Bosmeri religion), a unit of archers were dispatched from larger conflicts in the south. The Bosmer were thus goaded into splitting their forces into smaller groups.\nThe Bosmer archers took up positions in the remaining trees whose branches were now twenty or more feet apart, allowing some light into the forest floor. The Bosmer bent the remaining trees with their magics into small fortifications from which to fire their bows.\nWhen the tree-cutters arrived the next morning, a half dozen Khajiit fell to the Bosmer arrows in the first volley. After that the Khajiit took large wooden shields from the backs of the Senche-raht and made a crude shelter. The Khajiit, even the enormous Senche-raht, were able to hide between this shelter and one of the larger trees. When it became apparent that the Khajiit would not leave their shelter, some Bosmer choose to descend and engage the Khajiit sword-to-claw.\nWhen the Bosmer were nearly upon the shelter, one of the Khajiit began playing on a native instrument of plucked metal bars. This was a signal of some kind, and a small group of the man-like &lt;a href=\"Ohmes\"&gt;Ohmes&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Ohmes-raht\"&gt;Ohmes-raht&lt;/a&gt; emerged from covered holes on the forest floor. Although outnumbered, they were attacking from behind by surprise and won the ground quickly.\nThe Bosmer archers in the trees would have still won the battle were they not having troubles of their own. A group of &lt;a href=\"Dagi\"&gt;Dagi&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Dagi-raht\"&gt;Dagi-raht&lt;/a&gt;, two of the less common forms of Khajiit who live in the trees of the &lt;a href=\"Tenmar%20Forest\"&gt;Tenmar forest&lt;/a&gt;, jumped from one tree to another under a magical cover of silence. They took up positions in the higher branches that could not hold a Bosmer's weight. When the signal came, they used their claws and either torches or spells of fire (accounts from the two survivors I spoke with vary on this point) to distract the archers while the battle on the ground took place. A few of the archers were able to flee, but most were killed.\nApparently the Dagi and Dagi-raht have more magical ability than is widely believed if they were able to keep themselves magically silenced for so long. One of the surviving Bosmer told me that he saw a few ordinary cats among the Dagi and even claimed that these ordinary cats are known as '&lt;a href=\"Alfiq\"&gt;Alfiq&lt;/a&gt;' and that they were the spellcasters, but Bosmer are almost as unreliable as the Khajiit when it comes to the truth, and I cannot believe that a housecat can cast spells.\nAt the end of the day the Khajiit lost perhaps a half-dozen fighters out a force of no more than four dozen, while the Bosmer lost nearly an entire company of archers. The survivors were unable to report back before a second company of archers arrived and this strategy was repeated again, with similar results. Finally, a much larger force was sent and the Bosmer won that battle with the help of the native animals of &lt;a href=\"Valenwood\"&gt;Valenwood&lt;/a&gt;. That third skirmish and the Khajiiti response I will discuss in the second volume of this series.\nVolume Three.\nBy Codus Callonus&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt; The primary field of battle near Dune was a long stretch of grassland between the trees of Valenwood and the sands of Elsweyr. After the chaotic back-and-forth of the first year, the Khajiit held this stretch of land for months at a time and expanded it by cutting more trees across the old border. Many of the trees were carried off by the great Senche-raht. A few were taken into the city of Dune and their use became apparent during the siege.&lt;BR&gt; &lt;BR&gt; During the war, this process was rapid and easily seen, but the Khajiit and Bosmer in the Legion informed me that it had been going on long before the Third Era. This is how the unofficial border between Elsweyr and Valenwood is marked. The Khajiit cut down the trees, the Bosmer replant them, the Khajiit dig tunnels to undermine them, the Bosmer flood the tunnels to kill the Khajiit and make the desert bloom, and so on for centuries.&lt;BR&gt; &lt;BR&gt; The rapid shift from desert to grassland to forest is unique in all of Tamriel and may be the result of this constant cutting and re-planting. I asked Ja'Dhuzar, the only Khajiit I trusted and a fellow Legionnaire, about this the next day. At first he just repeated the common saying in Elsweyr that \"wide deserts make good neighbors.\" Eventually he said, and I believe I wrote this down exactly, even if it makes little sense, \"Do not weep for trees. Valenwood is a sholath (a kind of sand-burrowing crab). The trees are the fingers of Y'ffre who stretches, then grasps. If the forest grows too wide, it is another moon-dance of suffering, the shaper could finish her sculptures, and Ja'Dhuzar is clever enough already, don't you think?\"&lt;BR&gt; &lt;BR&gt; It seemed as if the Bosmer began to realize the Khajiit in the north were not as serious a threat as they first appeared and began moving troops south. The Khajiit likewise gave up the tree-cutting, fires, and raids into northern areas when the Bosmer stopped responding with larger forces. The Khajiit soon tired of the sport and broke up their largest camps and left only a minor defensive and scouting force in the area along with the usual \"peacetime\" (if this province has ever known it) garrison in the city proper.&lt;BR&gt; &lt;BR&gt; A few months after the main Khajiti force left, the Bosmer led an enormous attack and took all the Khajiti camps around Dune. The Khajiit sent scouts into the forest regularly, but even so the Khajiti camp was taken by surprise. I heard rumors later that the Bosmer caught the scouts, flayed them alive, wore their skins, and, with the aid of illusions, fooled the Khajiit into thinking the scouts continued patrolling and reporting. I heard also that the Bosmer led scouts into ambushes and used forbidden arts to re-animate them long enough to make a report. Either way, this proves beyond any doubt that the Empire must continue its effort to civilize the Bosmer.&lt;BR&gt; &lt;BR&gt; The commander of Fort Sphinxmoth, Gaius Apinius, wanted to send his own patrols and scouts into the surrounding areas, but we were under strict orders not to leave the fort, except to patrol the road from Dune to Riverhold and protect the few Imperial interests in the area. Of course, we all learned later those orders were those of the usurper.&lt;BR&gt; &lt;BR&gt; As a result, neither the Legions nor the Khajiit expected hundreds of naked Bosmer to run screaming out of the trees, covered with symbols drawn in blood, and followed by a howling menagerie of every wicked forest beast. The battle took place too far from the fort to see without a spyglass, and the dim light of a gibbous Masser was not enough to make out the full battle, but the unholy racket woke the whole fort. We stood on alert, sharing a half dozen spyglasses, and tried to follow the battle as best we could. I am no expert on Valenwood's fauna, and the view as I said was very poor, but we all agreed there were beasts out there unlike anything we had seen. The Bosmer attack looked wild and unplanned, but they used clever, if strange and dishonorable, tactics.&lt;BR&gt; &lt;BR&gt; Roughly one cohort of Bosmer archers and wizards, much more in control than the rest, climbed the remaining trees for range and defense before the attack. The blood-painted Bosmer had spells or enchantments upon them. They could do something, perhaps upon their death, which lit up the symbols painted upon them, making the Khajiit nearby easy targets for the archers that remained in the trees. The Bosmer spread out and ran towards the largest camps and groups of Khajiit, glowing as bright as dawn for a short while, and that whole area was soon covered with arrows. Their wizards aided in the battle by enchanting some of the arrows to burn or explode, which enflamed the Khajiti tents. The fire in turn maddened the forest creatures further and led to multiple stampedes back and forth across each camp until all the fires were stamped out along with most of the Khajiit. Dawn showed the city of Dune surrounded and no surviving Khajiit outside the city.&lt;BR&gt; &lt;BR&gt; The Bosmer celebrated their victory with primitive music and a great feast that lasted four or five days. There followed a period of calm for a few weeks as the Bosmer surrounding Dune constructed large trebuchets and other siege equipment. In spite of the Bosmers' ridiculous superstitions, there was an ample supply of lumber from the trees the Khajiit felled along the border. We joked in our fort that Dune might be captured with the wood of the trees the Khajiit cut down. I could not see anything in the city of Dune itself, except for archers who periodically fired volleys from the walls.&lt;BR&gt; &lt;BR&gt; As disturbing as the tactics of the Bosmer were, what the Khajiit did in return is almost too despicable to relate. There were few surviving Khajiit outside the walls and they used no tactics at all. When they returned from hiding in the desert, they charged straight into the Bosmer and were quickly slaughtered.&lt;BR&gt; &lt;BR&gt; But what seemed like a wasteful move was a trick so deplorable to all right-thinking men that I hesitate to describe it. As everyone knows, the Bosmer often eat the flesh of their enemies. As a veteran of the Imperial Legions I have seen this first-hand. Indeed, I have heard more than one Bosmer claim during the war that Khajiit are a great delicacy, prized for being both fatty and sweet. Almost as soon as the battle was over, cooking fires were built and the sounds of bone flutes and shell-drums heralded a great celebration in the Bosmer camps. And by the next morning, many of the Bosmer were dead and many more were ill.&lt;BR&gt; &lt;BR&gt; Before their suicidal charge the Khajiit drank a slow-acting poison made from the stingers of giant scorpions, poppies, and Quaestro Vil. There are many lessons the Legions could learn from the Five Years War, but this is one I hope the Empire will never employ.&lt;BR&gt; &lt;BR&gt; This foul trick didn't end the siege, however, for many Bosmer were still alive, even if their force was greatly weakened. The end of the siege of Dune is related in volume four.&lt;BR&gt;\nVolume Four.\nBy Codus Callonus&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt; The siege of Dune continued with a weakened Bosmer force surrounding the city. Neither side had the numbers to make much progress on the other. The Bosmer work on siege engines, mostly trebuchets and scaling towers, continued at a much slower pace.&lt;BR&gt; &lt;BR&gt; Minor skirmishes occurred throughout the siege, but none of them were significant, much less decisive. When the siege engines were finally being moved into place and loaded, it seemed the city of Dune was defenseless and would fall within the week, or perhaps even by that evening. The Bosmer engines were huge and imposing, much larger than those used by the Empire, and they appeared capable of throwing boulders weighing five hundred pounds or more. As much as the Bosmer claim to preserve trees, many of them are masters of carpentry and related crafts. Some of the engines were manned by Imga (who have no love for the Bosmer, but allegedly entered the war on the Bosmer side after the Khajiit, accidentally or otherwise, attacked one of their camps).&lt;BR&gt; &lt;BR&gt; The first rocks were thrown from the trebuchets and landed a little short of the city walls. As the Imga and the Bosmer adjusted their weights, small fire pots began flying towards the trebuchets from inside Dune. A few minutes after the battle started, one of the trebuchets was already on fire.&lt;BR&gt; &lt;BR&gt; But the next two volleys of the trebuchets hit their mark, and the walls of Dune soon had two breaches on the western wall. The Bosmer began to gather their forces for a charge into the city. The fire pots flying from inside the city slackened, and their accuracy was so poor only the one trebuchet was aflame. The Bosmer clearly believed the city was theirs for the taking.&lt;BR&gt; &lt;BR&gt; Just as the Bosmer began charging to the larger breach, the gates of Dune (located roughly north and south) opened and Khajiit poured forth from both sides. There were clearly few Khajiit able to do battle, but with clever tactics, they managed to defeat the larger Bosmer forces.&lt;BR&gt; &lt;BR&gt; The breaches were defended by heavily armored ground troops, mainly composed of the larger man-like Khajiit, such as the Cathay-raht and Suthay-raht. They were slow and seemed to be easy targets. The Bosmer forces rushed to engage them and enter Dune via the breach in the walls. The Khajiit took heavy losses at the first charge, but they were just there to break the charge and keep the Bosmer outside the walls. At this point, the Bosmer might have won the day if they focused on one breach and overran it.&lt;BR&gt; &lt;BR&gt; When the Bosmer were fully engaged, the gates of the city opened and three kinds of units ran out and quickly surrounded the Bosmer formed up at the breaches.&lt;BR&gt; &lt;BR&gt; The first were Senche-raht in harness pulling carts with small onagers, manned by the smaller Khajiit. Each cart had two onagers cleverly mounted on some kind of pivot so that one could be wound while the other was aiming and firing. The pivot let them fire in all directions except directly in front or back. They threw fire-pots in great quantity, but with little accuracy at range. However, their maneuverability allowed them to approach a siege engine or mass of Bosmer, fire a few shots, and flee before the Bosmer could retaliate.&lt;BR&gt; &lt;BR&gt; Along with them were small groups of archers and wizards, including the dreaded Alfiq, mounted on Senche and Pahmar-raht who used similar tactics, charging into range, releasing their arrows or spells, and then fleeing.&lt;BR&gt; &lt;BR&gt; Finally, there were small groups of ground units, mostly the smaller man-like Khajiit, armed with sling-spears. While a Bosmer unit was engaged with the heavy armored forces or distracted by the fire-pots, these would approach and sling stones at the Bosmer. If the Bosmer turned to engage them, they'd flee or charge with their spears and another similar sling-spear unit would attack the Bosmer from the rear.&lt;BR&gt; &lt;BR&gt; The units individually could not have won the battle, but they combined their forces brilliantly. The smaller, more maneuverable units were vulnerable, but kept attacking the Bosmer from the rear or the side, and they wore down the larger Bosmer forces with steady losses. The Legions fight in large formations wherever possible, and I fear the Khajiti tactics here might be effective against an unprepared Legion. The Legions are trained to use the dreugh or mudcrab formations where we can defend from attacks on all sides, but the fire pots and hit-and-run tactics might still disrupt a Legion cohort. The Bosmer had greater numbers, siege engines, and their famous archers, but they did not have the training or equipment to form up into something like the mudcrab, and they were routed. I have shared information privately with my superiors on how the Legion's use of javelins, shield formations, and our cavalry could defend against similar tactics, but my efforts to show how small, fast units can win against larger, less mobile units has not yet been incorporated into the Legions' drills and training.&lt;BR&gt; &lt;BR&gt; During the Bosmer rout, one of the trebuchets turned towards the fort. To our horror, the trebuchet fired twice with the second shot damaging a section of the fort's outer wall.&lt;BR&gt; &lt;BR&gt; A few good Legionnaires could have ended the war within its first year, but we had been ordered not to interfere unless the fort itself was attacked. I am a loyal citizen of the Empire, but I must admit that the orders we received from the Imperial City made little sense. Either the commanders did not understand the situation on the border, or the Simulacrum wanted to maximize chaos and weaken the Empire he ruled. Madness. I recommend giving only general standing orders to commanders in the field, with wide leeway on how to accomplish the Empire's goals. Even the best and fastest reports describe only a portion of what the local commanders know and even minutes of delay, when teleportation is used to transport critical orders, can decide a battle.&lt;BR&gt; &lt;BR&gt; First Spear Apinius took advantage of this invitation to form up the Legions and attack the Bosmer from the fort. When the Bosmer saw the Legions approach, they abandoned their trebuchets, four of which were on fire by this time, and fled back across the border. We pursued them only to the edge of the trees and then returned to the fort.&lt;BR&gt; &lt;BR&gt; As it turns out, we had been tricked again by the treacherous Khajiit. One of the small Khajiit groups that came out of the city overpowered the Bosmer and Imga manning that trebuchet and turned it on the fort. They anticipated we would leave the fort in response. While we were outside the walls, another group of Khajiit levitated over the walls and captured the fort. There was a perpetual camp of Khajiit merchants near the fort who sold treats and trinkets (and, in a sign of the decline in moral character of the Legion, other services -- even an Ohmes is still a Khajiit, and consorting with them should be punished with branding and expulsion, the same as horse-lovers) to the soldiers and staff. The camp was only a few tents, but elite Khajiti forces had been arriving for weeks and each tent hid a dozen armed Khajiit and at least one wizard.&lt;BR&gt; &lt;BR&gt; The Legions have many Khajiit and Bosmer members. Due to concerns about the loyalty of these members in a serious battle, the Commander assigned most of the Khajiit and Bosmer stationed at Fort Sphinxmoth to defense while the rest of us marched out. This turned out to be another mistake. We later learned that the Khajiit, almost without exception, turned on their fellow soldiers, causing chaos inside the fort and opening the gates. All the Bosmer in the fort were slain by the time we surrendered, including the young son of one of the cooks.&lt;BR&gt; &lt;BR&gt; Our situation was dire as we returned to Fort Sphinxmoth. We could not easily enter the Fort, now manned by Khajiit, and we were quickly being surrounded by the same fast-moving onager carts that had so effectively turned back the Bosmer forces. First Spear Apinius decided it was better to surrender to the Khajiit than risk our lives and those of the soldiers and staff who remained inside the fort.&lt;BR&gt; &lt;BR&gt; Note that I do not blame the First Spear for this decision. It was one he was forced to make due to the large number of Khajiit and Bosmer that had been unwisely assigned to Fort Sphinxmoth. Given the unreliable nature of the elves and beast races, I strongly recommend that these races not be assigned to any fort in or bordering their traditional lands. Even the Khajiit can serve honorably in the Legions, but they should be assigned to forts in Morrowind, High Rock, Skyrim, or the very heart of the Empire where the temptation for betrayal is not too strong for their weak character.&lt;BR&gt; &lt;BR&gt; This is the true story of the fall of Fort Sphinxmoth. It was not conquered in a pitched battle that every Khajiit these days claims to have led. The Legions were not defeated. We were betrayed &lt;BR&gt;\nVolume Five.\nBy Codus Callonus&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt; I spent the next two years of the war in Dune where the captured Legion was forced to forge weapons, repair the city walls, build a sewage system (a better one than the Khajiit could have managed on their own, I daresay), and work on other civic improvements. In truth, we were not treated as poorly as you might imagine. We were well fed and only beaten when one of us tried to escape, attacked a Khajiit, or refused to work. The Khajiit even provided healing (from a half dozen of the most pompous, self-important Alfiq I have ever met) when the red death ran through our camp. The most galling experience was the behavior of the former Legionnaire, Ja'Dhuzar, now calling himself Dro'Dhuzar, who strutted around the prison when he was in town, usually with a female of his race on each arm.&lt;BR&gt; &lt;BR&gt; Our captors claimed that they sent word to the Imperial City and were asking for a very modest ransom, but that they never heard any response. This may even be true. The Khajiit seemed to be more pleased in their \"victory\" over the invulnerable Legions than in a reward. Indeed, the story of how they captured Fort Sphinxmoth grew and grew in the telling until it became the story you're familiar with today. And the Imperial City under the Simulacrum was rumored to be corrupt and incapable of any governance, so the news of our capture may have been ignored or the ransom may have been stolen by one of the many new Offices of the time. I do not know the truth of it, and I was told that much of the Legions' records during these years were lost in a fire near the end of the Simulacrum's reign.&lt;BR&gt; &lt;BR&gt; As a prisoner, I did not witness the next phase of the battle near Dune. I only heard about it, and what I heard is difficult to believe. We were told by the Khajiit that the Bosmer had been growing hollow tree roots from Valenwood all the way under the city and were trying to invade from below. It is more likely that the Bosmer were digging much shorter tunnels from outside the city walls under the sands and reinforcing them with wood. In any case, the Khajiit mocked these efforts and often played pranks, such as filling the tunnel exits with stink bulbs, rotten eggs, sholath, stinging insects, and so on. Sometimes we'd hear muffled screams while working on the sewers or rebuilding the walls. The Khajiit nearby would all burst into laughter at this and plan what to do next. Why they never tried to seal the tunnels or took them seriously as a threat, I cannot understand.&lt;BR&gt; &lt;BR&gt; The Bosmer had the last laugh. We heard the war in the south was going poorly for Valenwood and the Bosmer did not have the forces to take Dune. They couldn't even hold their own territory. This was due in large part to the positions the Khajiit took and held all along the Xylo early in the war. The Bosmer snuck a very small force, no more than twenty, into the city. Instead of an attack, they simply stood near the exit of one of their tunnels and presented a challenge.&lt;BR&gt; &lt;BR&gt; I was able to see this challenge personally. Dro'Dhuzar came to get me early that morning. \"Rag-man,\" he said to me (I was taking notes on rags and sackcloth, and thought I had hidden them effectively), \"a challenger comes. You should witness a Knight of the Sandy Mane defeat a Knight of the Spider-Wood. See the fate of your Empire.\" He spat on the ground, and used the word knight in mockery of the Legion. But he led me to where the Bosmer were standing, just the same. One of them was very short and dressed in odd, ceremonial armor of wooden slats, obviously enchanted.&lt;BR&gt; &lt;BR&gt; There was some negotiation, mostly in Ta'agra, and I could not understand it. Soon a large Khajiit approached, a Pahmar-raht in ceremonial armor of his own. The Khajiit called him Dro'Zaksa, and clearly held him in high regard. There was a celebratory feel to the crowd and the Khajiit thought they were about to witness an easy victory. I was more apprehensive. The Bosmer knight was very brave or foolish and showed no fear of the upcoming duel.&lt;BR&gt; &lt;BR&gt; The negotiations were completed. I gathered that the Bosmer would take Dune and Fort Sphinxmoth if they won, and the Khajiit would take a \"living hill\" if they won. A space was made for the combatants. Dro'Zaksa was armed only with ebony claw-tips and wore heavy, for lack of a better word, barding. He was well protected from the front and the front half of his sides, but he was unarmored on his paws, head, and hind legs. The Knight of the Spider-Wood drew a very thin blade, barely even a rapier, and was covered head-to-toe with light armor made of wooden slats and some kind of fabric.&lt;BR&gt; &lt;BR&gt; They circled each other, measuring each other up. Dro'Zaksa attacked first, knocking the Bosmer across the field. He then pounced, but the Bosmer rolled away from it and stood again. The Bosmer made several attacks on Dro'Zaksa, but they could not pierce his armor. Dro'Zaksa grew more and more confident, and I must say I could not see how the Bosmer could win this fight. He took a huge swipe at the thin blade and it broke in two. He immediately followed with an aggressive series of blows, most of which the Bosmer managed to evade.&lt;BR&gt; &lt;BR&gt; The next minute of battle was the Pahmar leaping and swiping at the Bosmer while the Bosmer retreated in a circle, dodging the blows with rolls, leaps, and contortions. Dro'Zaksa seemed to be slowing a bit, and there were specks of blood all over the arena floor. At one point he looked at his paw, and saw that the blade had cut deeply when he broke it. This enraged him, and he attacked even more wildly and ferociously.&lt;BR&gt; &lt;BR&gt; The Khajiit at this point were growing nervous. They did not get the quick, easy victory they expected. The Bosmer focused on dodging and managed to evade almost all the blows, although it clearly took a toll when Dro'Zaksa landed one. The Bosmer's wooden armor was scarred from claw marks and whatever enchantments it held were beginning to fade.&lt;BR&gt; &lt;BR&gt; Soon the Bosmer was almost strolling around the arena as Dro'Zaksa stumbled and slipped in his own blood. Treacherous to the end, the Khajiit almost managed to swipe at the Bosmer by pretending to be weaker than he actually was, but after that the outcome was certain. \"The bleeding poison,\" Dro'Dhuzar said next to me. \"Clever.\"&lt;BR&gt; &lt;BR&gt; The Bosmer \"knight\" removed her helmet and gave the crowd a creepy, wolfish smile and began, to put it bluntly, butchering the Pahmar with her broken sword. The few Bosmer who accompanied her cheered. &lt;BR&gt; &lt;BR&gt; I expected the Khajiit to attack the Bosmer regardless of any agreement, but they packed up peacefully, if untidily, and left the city.&lt;BR&gt; &lt;BR&gt; The Bosmer took Dune and Fort Sphinxmoth. They did not hold us as prisoners, but let us go along with the Khajiit. We marched back to Skingrad to report and reorganize. We later heard that Valenwood surrendered. They returned Dune to the Khajiit in exchange for some territory in the south. When the Simulacrum was defeated, the rebellious provinces, finally under the threat of the punishment they should have faced from the start, returned to the Empire and Fort Sphinxmoth was likewise reinstated. I was stationed in Narsis and Stormhold for the remainder of my years of service and saw only small, easy battles with disorganized bandits and rebels.&lt;BR&gt;"}

I was stationed at the Sphinxmoth Legion Fort on the border near &lt;a href=\"Dune\"&gt;Dune&lt;/a&gt;\u00a0and witnessed many of the northern skirmishes firsthand.\nThe war started with the so-called \"&lt;a href=\"Slaughter%20of%20Torval\"&gt;Slaughter of Torval&lt;/a&gt;.\" The Khajiit claim that the Bosmer invaded the city without provocation and killed over a thousand citizens before being driven off by reinforcements from a nearby jungle tribe. The &lt;a href=\"Bosmer\"&gt;Bosmer&lt;/a&gt; claim that the attack was in retaliation for &lt;a href=\"A%20Dance%20in%20Fire%2C%20Book%20I\"&gt;Khajiti bandits who were attacking wood caravans headed for Valenwood&lt;/a&gt;.\nIn the spring of &lt;a href=\"3E%20396\"&gt;3E 396&lt;/a&gt; the war moved closer to &lt;a href=\"Fort%20Sphinxmoth\"&gt;Fort Sphinxmoth&lt;/a&gt;. I was posted on lookout and saw parts of the conflict. I later spoke with both Khajiit and Bosmer who fought in the battle, and it will serve as an excellent example of how the Khajiit used a mixture of ground and tree units to win the war.\nThe Khajiit began the fight in an unusual way by sending tree-cutting teams of &lt;a href=\"Cathay-raht\"&gt;Cathay-raht&lt;/a&gt; and the fearsome &lt;a href=\"Senche-raht\"&gt;Senche-raht&lt;/a&gt; or \"Battlecats\" into the outskirts of Valenwood's forests. When word reached the Bosmer that trees were being felled (allegedly a &lt;a href=\"Green%20Pact\"&gt;crime&lt;/a&gt; in the strange Bosmeri religion), a unit of archers were dispatched from larger conflicts in the south. The Bosmer were thus goaded into splitting their forces into smaller groups.\nThe Bosmer archers took up positions in the remaining trees whose branches were now twenty or more feet apart, allowing some light into the forest floor. The Bosmer bent the remaining trees with their magics into small fortifications from which to fire their bows.\nWhen the tree-cutters arrived the next morning, a half dozen Khajiit fell to the Bosmer arrows in the first volley. After that the Khajiit took large wooden shields from the backs of the Senche-raht and made a crude shelter. The Khajiit, even the enormous Senche-raht, were able to hide between this shelter and one of the larger trees. When it became apparent that the Khajiit would not leave their shelter, some Bosmer choose to descend and engage the Khajiit sword-to-claw.\nWhen the Bosmer were nearly upon the shelter, one of the Khajiit began playing on a native instrument of plucked metal bars. This was a signal of some kind, and a small group of the man-like &lt;a href=\"Ohmes\"&gt;Ohmes&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Ohmes-raht\"&gt;Ohmes-raht&lt;/a&gt; emerged from covered holes on the forest floor. Although outnumbered, they were attacking from behind by surprise and won the ground quickly.\nThe Bosmer archers in the trees would have still won the battle were they not having troubles of their own. A group of &lt;a href=\"Dagi\"&gt;Dagi&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Dagi-raht\"&gt;Dagi-raht&lt;/a&gt;, two of the less common forms of Khajiit who live in the trees of the &lt;a href=\"Tenmar%20Forest\"&gt;Tenmar forest&lt;/a&gt;, jumped from one tree to another under a magical cover of silence. They took up positions in the higher branches that could not hold a Bosmer's weight. When the signal came, they used their claws and either torches or spells of fire (accounts from the two survivors I spoke with vary on this point) to distract the archers while the battle on the ground took place. A few of the archers were able to flee, but most were killed.\nApparently the Dagi and Dagi-raht have more magical ability than is widely believed if they were able to keep themselves magically silenced for so long. One of the surviving Bosmer told me that he saw a few ordinary cats among the Dagi and even claimed that these ordinary cats are known as '&lt;a href=\"Alfiq\"&gt;Alfiq&lt;/a&gt;' and that they were the spellcasters, but Bosmer are almost as unreliable as the Khajiit when it comes to the truth, and I cannot believe that a housecat can cast spells.\nAt the end of the day the Khajiit lost perhaps a half-dozen fighters out a force of no more than four dozen, while the Bosmer lost nearly an entire company of archers. The survivors were unable to report back before a second company of archers arrived and this strategy was repeated again, with similar results. Finally, a much larger force was sent and the Bosmer won that battle with the help of the native animals of &lt;a href=\"Valenwood\"&gt;Valenwood&lt;/a&gt;. That third skirmish and the Khajiiti response I will discuss in the second volume of this series."}

She gains the most pleasure simply by doing the right thing and earning people's trust rather than by earning any material reward. She strongly dislikes the &lt;a href=\"Thieves%20Guild%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Thieves Guild&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Black-Briar%20family\"&gt;Black-Briar family&lt;/a&gt;, as she feels they contribute to a large part of Riften's corruption.\u00a0\nWhen traveling with Mjoll as a follower, she tells stories about her past as an adventurer, saying:\n\"When I was a child, my village was burned to the ground by bandits. Do you know I actually saw one laugh as he ran my brother through... my father wanted me to follow in his footsteps as a hunter, but I set my aspirations a bit higher. He never complained... I miss him. I've never been a sellsword... never traded my skills for pay. I've always adventured on my own terms.\"\nBackground.\nEarly life.\nWhen speaking about her past, Mjoll mentions that her mother taught her how to use a sword, and that her father was a hunter. She grew up in a village that was at one point burned to the ground by bandits, and her brother was killed during the raid; it is because of this that she harbors much resentment towards bandits.\nShe and her parents were very close, her mother often taking her to Solitude to gaze at the ships at the docks. She and her father occasionally journeyed east to &lt;a href=\"Morrowind\"&gt;Morrowind&lt;/a&gt; on hunting expeditions, &lt;a href=\"cliff%20racer\"&gt;cliff racer&lt;/a&gt;s being among the things they stalked. Her father wanted her to become a hunter as well, however her life took a different path when she became an adventurer.\nRiften.\nIn one of her most recent endeavors, she was nearly killed by a &lt;a href=\"Dwarven%20Centurion%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Dwarven Centurion&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;a href=\"Dwemer%20Ruins%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;ruins&lt;/a&gt;\u00a0of\u00a0&lt;a href=\"Mzinchaleft\"&gt;Mzinchaleft&lt;/a&gt;. It was only by her skill and persistence that she was able to escape. Barely alive, she was saved by &lt;a href=\"Aerin%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Aerin&lt;/a&gt;, who then brought her back to his home in &lt;a href=\"Riften%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Riften&lt;/a&gt; and nursed her back to health. While she recovered, Aerin revealed to her the corruption that plagued Riften. To return the favor, she has sworn to do whatever it takes to rid Riften of criminals and misers. To her disappointment, progress in that regard is slow. In her words, \"the city has to want to save itself before [she] can save it.\"\nInteractions.\n&lt;a href=\"Grimsever%27s%20Return\"&gt;Grimsever's Return&lt;/a&gt;.\nWhen the &lt;a href=\"Last%20Dragonborn\"&gt;Dragonborn&lt;/a&gt; first meets her in Riften, she speaks about losing her &lt;a href=\"Swords%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;sword&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Grimsever\"&gt;Grimsever&lt;/a&gt;. The Dragonborn may offer to retrieve it for her; if this objective is completed, Mjoll becomes a\u00a0&lt;a href=\"Marriage%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;potential spouse&lt;/a&gt;. She can also be recruited as a &lt;a href=\"Followers%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;follower&lt;/a&gt;, and if is installed, can be made a &lt;a href=\"Steward%20%28Hearthfire%29\"&gt;steward&lt;/a&gt; at one of the Dragonborn's &lt;a href=\"Homestead%20%28Hearthfire%29\"&gt;properties&lt;/a&gt;.\nTo receive Mjoll's quest, the &lt;a href=\"Last%20Dragonborn\"&gt;Dragonborn&lt;/a&gt; must be at least level 14 and Mjoll must like them. The easiest way to gain her favor is to simply agree with her in that the &lt;a href=\"Thieves%20Guild%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Thieves Guild&lt;/a&gt; in Riften is evil. Alternatively, Mjoll's favor can be gained by performing favors for the citizens of Riften. You must level up once after gaining her favor to receive the quest.\n&lt;a href=\"Marriage%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Marriage&lt;/a&gt;.\nIf the Dragonborn marries her with an &lt;a href=\"Amulet%20of%20Mara%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Amulet of Mara&lt;/a&gt;, beyond the quest's completion, she has the option of moving in with her spouse. Regardless of the home chosen, she opens a &lt;a href=\"Merchants%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;shop&lt;/a&gt; where goods can be sold and purchased. She will share daily profits with the Dragonborn, which start at 100 and increase by 100 daily. Uncollected profits stack and can be collected at any time. Mjoll's default residence is &lt;a href=\"Aerin%27s%20House\"&gt;Aerin's House&lt;/a&gt;. She continues to live there unless instructed otherwise. Should she move with her spouse to another house, Aerin follows her.\n&lt;a href=\"Rebuilding%20the%20Blades\"&gt;Rebuilding the Blades&lt;/a&gt;.\nMjoll may be recruited into the &lt;a href=\"Blades%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Blades&lt;/a&gt;, although Aerin will follow her to &lt;a href=\"Sky%20Haven%20Temple\"&gt;Sky Haven Temple&lt;/a&gt;. When she is engaging in a battle with a &lt;a href=\"Dragons%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;dragon&lt;/a&gt; alongside the Blades, Aerin follows and attempts to slay the dragon with his &lt;a href=\"Daggers%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;dagger&lt;/a&gt;. This usually results in his death. If Mjoll is married to the Dragonborn when recruited into the Blades, she can be told to go back to their designated home; she will say that she is going back to Riften but will actually go to Sky Haven Temple.\nEquipment.\nBy default, Mjoll uses a &lt;a href=\"Hunting%20Bow%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Hunting Bow&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Leveled%20Items%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;leveled battleaxe&lt;/a&gt; to fight. If Mjoll is given magic &lt;a href=\"Staves%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;staves&lt;/a&gt;, she will use them as her preferred weapons for striking at a distance. She can double-wield staves and is very quick and accurate both against targets on the ground and against flying dragons. However, she cannot recharge the staves herself; the Dragonborn must take them back, &lt;a href=\"Soul%20Gem%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;recharge&lt;/a&gt; them, and give them back to her.\nHer default armor is &lt;a href=\"banded%20iron%20armor\"&gt;banded iron armor&lt;/a&gt;, with &lt;a href=\"Iron%20Gauntlets%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;iron gauntlets&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Iron%20Boots%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;iron boots&lt;/a&gt;.\nDialogue.\n\"You're a stranger here too, eh?\"\n\"Visitors like us are rare in this part of Skyrim.\"\n\"Please be careful. I don't wish to be the reason for your death.\"\nUpon recovering the sword:\n\"Ah, you're back. What have you discovered?\"\n\"I see I still have much to learn. Lead on.\"\nConversations.\nMjoll: \"I had another run-in with the Thieves Guild.\"\n&lt;a href=\"Aerin%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Aerin&lt;/a&gt;: \"Be careful, Mjoll. The Thieves Guild has Maven Black-Briar at her back. One snap of her fingers, and you could end up in Riften Jail... or worse.\"\nMjoll: \"They represent the reason I'm here. I can't just ignore them, Aerin.\"\nAerin: \"I know. I just don't want you to leave; you're the only good thing that's happened to this city in a long time.\"\nAerin: \"Well, you were right. These so called 'Gutter Saints' live in the sewers beneath.\"\nMjoll: \"I suspected as much. The real question now is do we do something about it ourselves or do we speak to the Jarl?\"\nAerin: \"I say we go down there and clear the place out, just like old times.\"\nMjoll: \"No, my friend. That would be reckless. We have to help, but help in a way that doesn't directly place anyone in harm's way. For now, give this 'Ratway' a wide berth.\"\nMjoll: \"Sometimes I'm not certain that the people of Riften want to be helped.\"\nAerin: \"I think some of them do, Lady Mjoll. They're just too frightened to step up and do something about it like you are.\"\nMjoll: \"Aerin, you never cease to amaze me. You always see the good in everything.\"\nAerin: \"It's only because I've had an excellent teacher.\"\nAerin: \"You've been in Riften for quite some time now, Lady Mjoll. I fear that you soon may leave us.\"\nMjoll: \"Riften has problems of its own. Now is not the time for exploration and discovery.\"\nAerin: \"I'm relieved to hear you say that. If you were to leave, I'd miss you terribly.\"\nMjoll: \"Aerin, I owe you my life. It would take a threat to all of Skyrim for me to depart.\"\nMjoll: \"Aerin, have you seen my ring? The one with the inscription?\"\nAerin: \"No, I haven't. Don't tell me you've lost it.\"\nMjoll: \"I hope not. That ring is irreplaceable.\"\nAerin: \"I'll look around the house and if I find it, I'll bring it to you right away.\"\nMjoll: \"\"Well met, &lt;a href=\"Brand-Shei\"&gt;Brand-Shei&lt;/a&gt;. I've come by to browse your wares today.\"\"\nBrand-Shei: \"Is it true you chased a thief from your home? I overheard Aerin mentioning it.\"\nMjoll: \"\"It's true. Wasn't much of a thief though. Made enough noise to wake the &lt;a href=\"Red%20Mountain\"&gt;Red Mountain&lt;/a&gt;.\"\"\nBrand-Shei: \"Good. Maybe that will teach them to leave honest citizens alone.\"\nMjoll: \"\"I was hoping you could help me. It seems I've lost a ring that also means quite a bit to me. It's made of gold with an inscription on the inside that says \"sand elske.\"\"\"\nBrand-Shei: \"I'm afraid not. I don't deal in stolen goods.\"\nMjoll: \"Stolen? How can you be certain? I may have just misplaced it somewhere in the city.\"\nBrand-Shei: \"Lady Mjoll, if you lost a gold ring anywhere in this city I'm afraid it's likely never to be seen again. I'm sorry.\"\n&lt;a href=\"Drifa\"&gt;Drifa&lt;/a&gt;: \"Mjoll! I'm glad I found you.\"\nMjoll: \"What is it, Drifa? What's the matter?\"\nDrifa: \"It's Bersi. He's getting so angry about the corruption in Riften, he said he's going to walk right up to Maven and give her a piece of his mind.\"\nMjoll: \"If I see him, I'll make sure he doesn't do anything brash. Don't worry.\"\nMjoll: \"Aerin tells me you might be dealing arms to the Thieves Guild. Is this true?\"\n&lt;a href=\"Grelka\"&gt;Grelka&lt;/a&gt;: \"I don't know what he's talking about. He must be seeing things.\"\nMjoll: \"I'm watching you, Grelka. One slip up and I report you to the guards. You got that?\"\nGrelka: \"Whatever you say.\"\n&lt;a href=\"Madesi\"&gt;Madesi&lt;/a&gt;: \"Hello, Lady Mjoll.\"\nMjoll: \"Madesi, my friend. How have things been since last week's incident?\"\nMadesi: \"Ever since you scared off that thug from the Thieves Guild, not one of them's bothered me. We're lucky to have you here.\"\nMjoll: \"It's my pleasure. If you see the Thieves Guild harassing anyone else, you be sure and let me know.\"\nMjoll: \"\"&lt;a href=\"Maven%20Black-Briar\"&gt;Maven&lt;/a&gt;. How's the criminal underworld treating you this fine day?\"\"\nMaven: \"You may have everyone else impressed around here, but you don't impress me. You couldn't touch me if you wanted to.\"\nMjoll: \"You're a cold, unfeeling bitch.\"\nMaven: \"My dear, you have no idea who you're trifling with. Now I suggest you turn around and rattle someone else's cage before you get hurt.\"\nMjoll: \"I'm watching you, Maven Black-Briar. One day, you'll slip up and your Imperial friends won't be there to catch your fall.\"\nMjoll: \"\"Have you prepared the stables like I suggested, &lt;a href=\"Shadr\"&gt;Shadr&lt;/a&gt;?\"\"\nShadr: \"Yes, Lady Mjoll. If Riften gets attacked, we'll retreat inside the city gates and bar the door just like you said.\"\nMjoll: \"Good. You could be our first line of defense since you live outside the city walls, so we're depending on you.\""}

When the &lt;a href=\"Aldmeri%20Dominion%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Aldmeri Dominion&lt;/a&gt; invaded &lt;a href=\"Black%20Marsh\"&gt;Black Marsh&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"2E%20582\"&gt;2E 582&lt;/a&gt;, they sought out the egg to use against the &lt;a href=\"Ebonheart%20Pact\"&gt;Ebonheart Pact&lt;/a&gt;.

The Vestige then entered the dreams of the Hist through the egg and destroyed the corruption within."}

During this time a blue star appears in the sky, marking them as both similar and different to the other Magna-Ge. The Mnemoli have been called both a single entity and a group of entities.\nThe Mnemoli's association with Dragon Breaks mean that they can be used to perform specific acts during a Dragon Break, which have been implied to be part of how the &lt;a href=\"Marukhati%20Selective\"&gt;Selectives&lt;/a&gt; split &lt;a href=\"Akatosh\"&gt;Akatosh&lt;/a&gt; from &lt;a href=\"Auri-El\"&gt;Auri-El&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe Mnemoli are acknowledged by few cultures on &lt;a href=\"Tamriel\"&gt;Tamriel&lt;/a&gt;, with only the &lt;a href=\"Psijic%20Order\"&gt;Psijic Order&lt;/a&gt; giving them much regard; they are noted to be the cause of a pilgrimage to &lt;a href=\"Morrowind\"&gt;Veloth&lt;/a&gt; for them during Dragon Breaks. However, they may be held in reverence by the Magna-Ge themselves, who potentially consider their state of being outside of time one of \"harmony.\" They are referred to as the \"keepers of the &lt;a href=\"Elder%20Scrolls\"&gt;Elder Scrolls&lt;/a&gt;.\"\nFunction.\nThe Mnemoli function as the writers of the Elder Scrolls. They do this by collecting the \"songs\" produced by the music of &lt;a href=\"Nirn\"&gt;Nirn&lt;/a&gt;. They shape these songs into realities that can be written into the Elder Scrolls. The Mnemoli then distribute these in the Elder Scrolls as possible realities. However, as not all of the possible realities work together without contradicting, they must be validated by the Hero-Event function described by Zurin Arctus. However, this theory is in direct contradiction with the contents of the book \"&lt;a href=\"Pension%20of%20the%20Ancestor%20Moth\"&gt;Pension of the Ancestor Moth&lt;/a&gt;\". By partaking in the creation of Nirn, the Mnemoli became Aedra. And as the aforementioned book reads, the Elder Scrolls \"exceed both &lt;a href=\"Aedra\"&gt;Aedra&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Daedra\"&gt;Daedra&lt;/a&gt;\", making it impossible for the Mnemoli to have written the Elder Scrolls."}

Primarily this is a result of the Imperial Charter granted the &lt;a href=\"Mages%20Guild\"&gt;Mages Guild&lt;/a&gt; permitting the summoning of Daedra. Nonetheless, chapel and public opinion is so strongly against Daedra worship that those who practice Daedric rituals do so in secret.\nHowever, opinions about Daedra worship differ widely in other provinces. Even in Cyrodiil, traditional opinions have changed greatly over the years, and some communities survive which worship Daedra. Some more traditional Daedra-worshippers are motivated by piety and personal conviction; many modern Daedra-worshippers are motivated by a lust for arcane power. In particular, questing heroes of all stripes seek after the fabled Daedric artifacts for their potent combat and magical benefits.\nI personally have discovered one community worshipping the Daedra Lord &lt;a href=\"Azura\"&gt;Azura&lt;/a&gt;, Queen of Dawn and Dusk. A researcher curious about Daedra worship might research in several ways: through a study of the literature, through exploration and discovery of ancient daedric shrines, through questioning local informants, and through questioning worshippers themselves. I used all these means to discover the shrine of Azura.\nFirst I read books. References like this one may provide a helpful general background concerning Daedric shrines. For example, my researches led me to understand that, in Cyrodiil, Daedric shrines are generally represented by statues of Daedra Lords, are generally situated in wilderness locations far from settlements, that each shrine generally has associated with it a community of worshippers, often referred to as a 'coven', that shrines have associated with them a particular time -- often a day of the week -- when a Daedra lord might be solicited, that Daedra Lord often will not deign to respond unless they regard a petitioner of sufficient prowess or strength of character, that they will only respond if given the proper offering [the secret of which offering often known only to the community of worshippers], and that, in return for the completion of some task or service, the Daedra Lords will often undertake to offer an artifact of power to a successful quester.\nThen I questioned locals with an intimate knowledge of the wilderness. Two classes of informants I found especially useful -- well-traveled hunters and adventurers [who might come across shrines in their travels], and scholars of the Mages Guild. In the case of the Shrine of Azura, both sources were profitable. I discovered a &lt;a href=\"Cheydinhal\"&gt;Cheydinhal&lt;/a&gt; hunter who had chanced across a strange epic statue in his travels. The statue was of a woman with outstretched arms; in one hand she held a star; in the other hand, she held a crescent moon. He had shunned the statue out of superstitious fear, but had marked the location in memory --far north of Cheydinhal, northwest of &lt;a href=\"Lake%20Arrius\"&gt;Lake Arrius&lt;/a&gt;, high in the &lt;a href=\"Jerall%20Mountains\"&gt;Jerall Mountains&lt;/a&gt;. Then, proceeding to the local Mages Guild with a description of the statue, I was able to confirm from its description the identity of the Daedra Lord worshipped.\nHaving discovered the location of the shrine, I visited it, and discovered there the community of worshippers. Because of the strength of opinion against Daedra worship, the worshippers were, at first, reluctant to admit their identity. But once I had won their trust, they were willing to divulge to me the secrets of the times when Azura would hear petitions [from dusk to dawn], and that the offering required by Azura was glow dust, a substance obtained from the will-o-the-wisp.\nI am, of course, nothing more than a chapelman and scholar, so it did not lie within my power to find a will-o-the-wisp to obtain &lt;a href=\"glow%20dust\"&gt;glow dust&lt;/a&gt;; nor am I certain that Azura would have found me worthy to make such an offering, even had I proffered it. But I was assured that if I had been able to make such an offering, and if it had been accepted, Azura would have given me some sort of quest, which, if completed, might have earned me the reward of &lt;a href=\"Azura%27s%20Star\"&gt;Azura's Star&lt;/a&gt;, a Daedric artifact of legendary magical powers.\nI have since heard rumors of the existence in Cyrodiil of several other Daedric shrines, of the Daedric Lords to which they are dedicated, and the Daedric artifacts that might be won by questing heroes. &lt;a href=\"Hircine\"&gt;Hircine&lt;/a&gt; the Huntsman, for example, is linked in legend to the &lt;a href=\"Cuirass%20of%20the%20Savior%27s%20Hide\"&gt;Cuirass of the Savior's Hide&lt;/a&gt;, a powerful enchanted armor. The sword &lt;a href=\"Volendrung\"&gt;Volendrung&lt;/a&gt; is associated with &lt;a href=\"Malacath\"&gt;Malacath&lt;/a&gt;, Lord of Monsters, and the eponymously named &lt;a href=\"Mace%20of%20Molag%20Bal\"&gt;Mace of Molag Bal&lt;/a&gt; is also thought to be the object of Daedra worship. Other Daedra Lords, their shrines and worshippers, remain to be discovered in Cyrodiil by earnest and persistent researchers."}

He is a rather sharp speaker, quick to irritate and anger, but fiercely loyal to the Fighters Guild, and proud of the members that show skill and competence. He has little tolerance for members who would tarnish its reputation, or those he deems as a threat to the guild, whether it is a single member or an entire chapter, as one worth looking over carefully.\nBackground.\nOreyn's part in the Fighters Guild questline begins with a mission: a wizard named Argoth arranges for the retrieval of an artifact from a warrior named &lt;a href=\"Azani%20Blackheart%20%28Character%29\"&gt;Azani Blackheart&lt;/a&gt;. The mission goes awry, with only five of the twenty men returning. In the escape, &lt;a href=\"Vitellus%20Donton\"&gt;Vitellus Donton&lt;/a&gt;, one of the Fighters Guild head &lt;a href=\"Vilena%20Donton\"&gt;Vilena Donton&lt;/a&gt;'s two sons, is slain, trying to defend the group as they flee.\nOreyn tries to investigate the matter, discovering later that the &lt;a href=\"Blackwood%20Company\"&gt;Blackwood Company&lt;/a&gt; managed to complete the mission. He finds this hard to believe, as he is unconvinced of any particular skill on the part of the Blackwood Company, and surmises that something is amiss.\nHe keeps a vigil over Vilena's remaining son, &lt;a href=\"Viranus%20Donton\"&gt;Viranus Donton&lt;/a&gt;, providing the young warrior with obscure contracts to keep the boy sharp, skilled and confident, while keeping it secret from his mother, at one point &lt;a href=\"The%20Master%27s%20Son\"&gt;pairing him up&lt;/a&gt; with the &lt;a href=\"Hero%20of%20Kvatch\"&gt;Hero&lt;/a&gt;. At the same time, Oreyn finds that the Blackwood Company seems to be taking over many jobs, leaving some Fighters Guild members to lounge while waiting for some form of money, and even losing members, who favour the growing business of Blackwood.\nWhen it becomes too suspicious, and apparent that the Hero is a little more than just skilled, he investigates further into the Blackwood Company. The wizard Argoth turns up dead, and the artifact missing, leading Oreyn to believe that the mission may well have been a setup. To expose Blackwood as frauds, he and the Hero go to &lt;a href=\"Azani%20Blackheart%20%28Quest%29\"&gt;find and slay&lt;/a&gt; Azani Blackheart, who is rumoured to be holed up at the &lt;a href=\"Ayleid\"&gt;Ayleid&lt;/a&gt; ruins of &lt;a href=\"Arpenia%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;Arpenia&lt;/a&gt;. Upon arrival, there is no sign of anyone, save for a few &lt;a href=\"Rat%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;rats&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"mudcrab%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;mudcrabs&lt;/a&gt;, confirming Oreyn's suspicions that Blackheart and Blackwood struck a deal, with the latter weaving a story at the expense of the Fighters Guild to build their reputation, while Blackheart keeps his artifact and simultaneously thins the ranks of the guild. After slaying Blackheart with the Hero's aid, he returns to the Fighters Guild.\nLater, Oreyn sends Viranus on yet &lt;a href=\"Trolls%20of%20Forsaken%20Mine\"&gt;another contract&lt;/a&gt;, with a group of guild members, but loses contact with them. The Hero reveals that all of them died, though it is apparent that the Blackwood Company is responsible. Oreyn is expelled from the guild due to Viranus' death, but remains loyal, conducting investigations on Blackwood on his own in order to bring them down.\nOnce the Hero manages to reclaim their rank, Oreyn speaks with them. When the Hero &lt;a href=\"Information%20Gathering\"&gt;manages to capture&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Ajum-Kajin\"&gt;Ajum-Kajin&lt;/a&gt;, one of the Blackwood's leaders, and interrogate him the two find that Blackwood is over 100 men strong, and that its leader is &lt;a href=\"Ri%27Zakar\"&gt;Ri'Zakar&lt;/a&gt;, but Ajum kills himself with an enchanted ring before he can reveal the secret behind Blackwood's strength.\nAs a result, Oreyn sends the Hero to &lt;a href=\"Infiltration%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;infiltrate&lt;/a&gt; Blackwood. He later finds the Hero unconscious in &lt;a href=\"Leyawiin%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;Leyawiin&lt;/a&gt;. The Hero informs Oreyn that &lt;a href=\"Hist%20Sap%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;Hist Sap&lt;/a&gt;, a powerful narcotic, is being produced and is responsible for the berserker-like characteristic of the Blackwood Company fighters. As a dangerous side effect, the hist sap causes delusions, which explains the Blackwood Company's &lt;a href=\"Water%27s%20Edge\"&gt;indiscriminate killing&lt;/a&gt;. After the\u00a0&lt;a href=\"Hist%20Trees\"&gt;Hist Tree&lt;/a&gt; is destroyed, Vilena Donton steps down as Guildmaster, and Oreyn becomes assistant to the Hero, who takes Vilena's place.\nWhen asked to become the guild's second in command, Oreyn at first appears hesitant, and says that he is getting into retirement and that his art is becoming quite good. The Hero can look behind Oreyn to see his picture depicting the interrogation of Ajum Kajin, which looks like it was painted by a very small child. However, after a few moments thought, he reconsiders, sarcastically (though perhaps good-naturedly) remarking that the guild might well fall around the Hero's ears without Oreyn to keep them in line.

Molag Amur is a treacherous region to cross as the volcanic ashlands can be damaging to a commoner. Regardless, the many pilgrims travel along the main road located along the rim of the region. The town of &lt;a href=\"Molag%20Mar\"&gt;Molag Mar&lt;/a&gt; serves as a resting stop for pilgrims partaking in the &lt;a href=\"Pilgrimages%20of%20the%20Seven%20Graces\"&gt;Pilgrimage of the Seven Graces&lt;/a&gt;. A test to show dedication to Vivec of the Tribunal. Large lava rivers referred to as &lt;a href=\"Foyada\"&gt;Foyada&lt;/a&gt;s are found throughout Molag Amur such as &lt;a href=\"Foyada%20Nadanat\"&gt;Foyada Nadanat&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Foyada%20Zabirbael\"&gt;Foyada Zabirbael&lt;/a&gt;, the two largest foyadas in Molag Amur. The local &lt;a href=\"Ashlander\"&gt;Ashlander&lt;/a&gt;s thrive in the region, and the most growing tribe in Molag Amur is the &lt;a href=\"Erabenimsun%20Tribe\"&gt;Erabenimsun Tribe&lt;/a&gt;, their camp is located in a canyon north of &lt;a href=\"Mount%20Assarnibibi\"&gt;Mount Assarnibibi&lt;/a&gt;. According to legends, there is a race of super monster that lives in Molag Amur. They are the result of Vivec's seduction on &lt;a href=\"Molag%20Bal\"&gt;Molag Bal&lt;/a&gt;.\nHistory.\n&lt;a href=\"Second%20Era\"&gt;Second Era&lt;/a&gt;.\nDuring the &lt;a href=\"Interregnum\"&gt;Interregnum&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"2E%20583\"&gt;2E 583&lt;/a&gt;, the town of &lt;a href=\"Molag%20Mar\"&gt;Molag Mar&lt;/a&gt; was recently built, at least during the construction of &lt;a href=\"Vivec%20City\"&gt;Vivec City&lt;/a&gt; which had been going on for quite some time. The settlement was given to the &lt;a href=\"Buoyant%20Armigers\"&gt;Buoyant Armigers&lt;/a&gt;, the personal guard of Vivec, as their headquarters in &lt;a href=\"Vvardenfell\"&gt;Vvardenfell&lt;/a&gt;. Many pilgrims traveled to Molag Mar on their way to shrines in Molag Amur; the town was built to benefit them as well. Pilgrims coming to Molag Mar were disappearing on the road, resulting in the Buoyant Armigers to investigate the situation. &lt;a href=\"Captain%20Naros\"&gt;Captain Naros&lt;/a&gt; tasked an Outlander called the &lt;a href=\"Vestige\"&gt;Vestige&lt;/a&gt; to investigate the nearby &lt;a href=\"Ashlander\"&gt;Ashlander&lt;/a&gt; tribe in &lt;a href=\"Almurbalarammi\"&gt;Almurbalarammi&lt;/a&gt; and to see if there is a link to the disappearances. &lt;a href=\"Ibaal\"&gt;Ibaal&lt;/a&gt; of the Ashlanders think that the &lt;a href=\"Ruddy%20Man\"&gt;Ruddy Man&lt;/a&gt; is responsible and is located in the &lt;a href=\"Dreudurai%20Glass%20Mine\"&gt;Dreudurai Glass Mine&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Mount%20Kand\"&gt;Mount Kand&lt;/a&gt;. After traversing the mine, it was revealed that the &lt;a href=\"Dreugh\"&gt;Dreugh&lt;/a&gt; in Dreudurai was responsible but the Ruddy Man himself was not involved. Pilgrims continued to come in Molag Mar and peace returned in the region.\nAround the same time, a group of explorers led by an &lt;a href=\"Altmer\"&gt;Altmer&lt;/a&gt; Mage named &lt;a href=\"Neramo\"&gt;Neramo&lt;/a&gt; funded an expedition into &lt;a href=\"Nchuleftingth\"&gt;Nchuleftingth&lt;/a&gt;, to uncover the &lt;a href=\"Heart%20of%20Lorkhan\"&gt;Heart of Lorkhan&lt;/a&gt; from the inner sanctum. Neramo's rival, an Altmer Battlemage named &lt;a href=\"Artisan%20Lenarmen\"&gt;Artisan Lenarmen&lt;/a&gt; sought the Bthark Prism along with his private militia known as the &lt;a href=\"Bronzefists\"&gt;Bronzefists&lt;/a&gt;. Neramo and his assistant, &lt;a href=\"Vimy%20Lacroix\"&gt;Vimy Lacroix&lt;/a&gt;, sought the aid of the Vestige to defeat Lenarmen and to recover the Heart of Lorkhan from the center of Nchuleftingth. In the end, the Vestige defeated Lenarmen and the Bronzefists. The Heart of Lorkhan was not located in Nchuleftingth but instead, the &lt;a href=\"Bthark%20Prism\"&gt;Bthark Prism&lt;/a&gt; was recovered instead.\n&lt;a href=\"Third%20Era\"&gt;Third Era&lt;/a&gt;.\nBy &lt;a href=\"3E%20427\"&gt;3E 427&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"Dunmer\"&gt;Dunmer&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"House%20Telvanni\"&gt;House Telvanni&lt;/a&gt; began to move from the nearby &lt;a href=\"Azura%27s%20Coast\"&gt;Azura's Coast&lt;/a&gt; and created the settlement called &lt;a href=\"Tel%20Uvirith\"&gt;Tel Uvirith&lt;/a&gt;.

The &lt;a href=\"Blight\"&gt;Blight&lt;/a&gt; was released onto Vvardenfell in the same year, and this disease has affected various settlements including the few on the Bitter Coast.

He is also known by the titles King of Rape, King of Strife, Schemer Prince, Harvester of Souls, Father of &lt;a href=\"Coldharbour\"&gt;Coldharbour&lt;/a&gt; and Lord of Lies. He is the creator of &lt;a href=\"Vampire\"&gt;Vampire&lt;/a&gt;s and &lt;a href=\"Xivkyn\"&gt;Xivkyn&lt;/a&gt; as well.\nHis main desire is to harvest and consume the souls of mortals and to bring mortals' souls under his sway by spreading seeds of strife and discord in the mortal realms, and has even attempted to merge &lt;a href=\"Nirn\"&gt;Nirn&lt;/a&gt; with his own freezing realm of Coldharbour. He holds much importance in &lt;a href=\"Morrowind\"&gt;Morrowind&lt;/a&gt; where he is one of the &lt;a href=\"House%20of%20Troubles\"&gt;Four Corners of the House of Troubles&lt;/a&gt;, seen as the arch-enemy of &lt;a href=\"Boethiah\"&gt;Boethiah&lt;/a&gt;, the Daedric Prince of Plots. He is the primary antagonist of .\nAppearance and personality.\nMolag Bal resembles a large, bipedal hybrid of a bull and a reptile, and usually appears in a form adorned with horns, fangs, claws and a long tail. His scaly appearance is matched by his demeanor: Molag Bal is the master of corruption, and his freezing realm of Coldharbour in &lt;a href=\"Oblivion%20%28Realm%29\"&gt;Oblivion&lt;/a&gt; is a twisted reflection of Nirn, consisting of nothing but desolation and suffering.\nGender.\nLike all the Daedric Princes, Molag Bal has no definite gender. Most often, however, he appears to his followers as male. &lt;a href=\"Sigillah%20Parate\"&gt;Sigillah Parate&lt;/a&gt; mentions in her spiritual commentary that she belonged to a cult known as the \"Witches of Molag Bal,\" where Molag Bal often appeared to its members in the guise of a mortal female.\nShrine.\nA shrine of Molag Bal is in &lt;a href=\"Markarth%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Markarth&lt;/a&gt;, in a tunnel underneath the &lt;a href=\"Abandoned%20House%20%28Markarth%29\"&gt;Abandoned House&lt;/a&gt;. For a Daedric shrine, it is extremely small, consisting only of a sort of stone basin decorated with a stylized head of Molag Bal. A panel on the floor in front of it can extend spikes in order to trap sacrificial victims. The &lt;a href=\"Rusty%20Mace\"&gt;Rusty Mace&lt;/a&gt; \u2014 in reality the &lt;a href=\"Mace%20of%20Molag%20Bal\"&gt;Mace of Molag Bal&lt;/a&gt; \u2014 is found &lt;a href=\"The%20House%20of%20Horrors\"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt; by the Dragonborn. If is installed there will be a shrine inside &lt;a href=\"Castle%20Volkihar\"&gt;Castle Volkihar&lt;/a&gt;.\nPlane of Oblivion.\nMolag Bal's plane of &lt;a href=\"Oblivion%20%28Realm%29\"&gt;Oblivion&lt;/a&gt; is &lt;a href=\"Coldharbour\"&gt;Coldharbour&lt;/a&gt;. The book \"&lt;a href=\"The%20Doors%20of%20Oblivion\"&gt;The Doors of Oblivion&lt;/a&gt;\" says that his plane resembles a copy of &lt;a href=\"Nirn\"&gt;Nirn&lt;/a&gt;, including the &lt;a href=\"Imperial%20Palace\"&gt;Imperial Palace&lt;/a&gt;, but desecrated and ruined. The ground is sludge, the sky is on fire, and the air is freezing.\nColdharbour is featured in , being the final region of the &lt;a href=\"Main%20Quest%20%28Online%29\"&gt;main questline&lt;/a&gt; leading up to the assault on Molag Bal.\nHistory and legend.\nMorrowind.\nMolag Bal is the main source of the obstacles faced by the &lt;a href=\"Dunmer\"&gt;Dunmer&lt;/a&gt; (and preceding &lt;a href=\"Chimer\"&gt;Chimer&lt;/a&gt;) people. In the legends, Molag Bal always tries to upset the bloodlines of &lt;a href=\"Great%20Houses\"&gt;Great Houses&lt;/a&gt; or otherwise ruin Dunmeri 'purity,' befitting his title as the King of Rape. He is said to have seduced &lt;a href=\"Vivec\"&gt;Vivec&lt;/a&gt; and fathered a population of monsters that ran amok across Morrowind, that Vivec later had to slay to extinction. This race may have been the first vampires, a corruption of Vivec's ties to the &lt;a href=\"Heart%20of%20Lorkhan\"&gt;Heart of Lorkhan&lt;/a&gt; transmitted to mortals. It is possible he assisted &lt;a href=\"Jagar%20Tharn\"&gt;Jagar Tharn&lt;/a&gt; in his temporary ascendance to the Imperial throne. He was also responsible for the destruction of a city, &lt;a href=\"Gilverdale\"&gt;Gilverdale&lt;/a&gt;, at the end of the First Era.\nFirst Era.\nIn &lt;a href=\"1E%202920\"&gt;1E 2920&lt;/a&gt;, Molag Bal, under the summon of King Dro'Zel of &lt;a href=\"Senchal\"&gt;Senchal&lt;/a&gt;, destroyed the city of &lt;a href=\"Gilverdale\"&gt;Gilverdale&lt;/a&gt;. All the inhabitants were killed in a bright red mist. This Daedric massacre forced &lt;a href=\"Sotha%20Sil\"&gt;Sotha Sil&lt;/a&gt; to make a &lt;a href=\"Coldharbour%20Compact\"&gt;journey&lt;/a&gt; to Coldharbour, dealing with some of the prominent Daedric Princes in order to avoid the fate of Gilverdale happening to other cities in &lt;a href=\"Tamriel\"&gt;Tamriel&lt;/a&gt;, as Morrowind was still fighting a war against &lt;a href=\"Cyrodiil\"&gt;Cyrodiil&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Interregnum\"&gt;Interregnum&lt;/a&gt;.\nMolag Bal appears as the main antagonist in . He takes advantage of the destruction and war going on in Tamriel and attempts to merge Nirn and Coldharbour into one nightmarish hellscape by using Daedric machines called &lt;a href=\"Dark%20Anchors\"&gt;Dark Anchors&lt;/a&gt;, in an event known as the &lt;a href=\"Planemeld\"&gt;Planemeld&lt;/a&gt;.\nBattle of Coldharbour.\nThe Soulless One, also known as &lt;a href=\"Vestige\"&gt;Vestige&lt;/a&gt;, along with &lt;a href=\"Vanus%20Galerion\"&gt;Vanus Galerion&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"Fighters%20Guild\"&gt;Fighters Guild&lt;/a&gt;, and the &lt;a href=\"Mages%20Guild\"&gt;Mages Guild&lt;/a&gt; lead an attack on Coldharbour to confront Molag Bal and put an end to his treachery. A city controlled by &lt;a href=\"Meridia\"&gt;Meridia&lt;/a&gt; was transported into Coldharbour by Meridia herself, and since Molag Bal had no power over it, the Soulless One and the attack force were able to use the city as a safe haven while in Coldharbour and save many mortals who were \"stuck\" in Coldharbour. With the help of the &lt;a href=\"Ayleid\"&gt;Ayleid&lt;/a&gt; king &lt;a href=\"Laloriaran%20Dynar\"&gt;Laloriaran Dynar&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Vanus%20Galerion\"&gt;Vanus Galerion&lt;/a&gt; the &lt;a href=\"Altmer\"&gt;Altmer&lt;/a&gt;i founder of the Mages Guild, they pushed further into Coldharbour's citadel to Molag Bal's lair. Later on, &lt;a href=\"the%20Groundskeeper\"&gt;the Groundskeeper&lt;/a&gt; revealed her true nature as the Daedric Prince Meridia and the Soulless One and &lt;a href=\"Five%20Companions\"&gt;Five Companions&lt;/a&gt; went through a portal to an area that was under complete domination of Molag Bal's forces. Meridia and Molag Bal met face to face and began dueling, allowing the Soulless One to proceed to destroy the Dark Anchors. Upon confrontation the Soulless One used the &lt;a href=\"Amulet%20of%20Kings\"&gt;Amulet of Kings&lt;/a&gt; on the &lt;a href=\"Daedric%20Prince\"&gt;Daedric Prince&lt;/a&gt; before they could be defeated. The two began to battle, both equal in power with divinity, but in the end, Molag Bal fell for the first time and was \"dominated\" by the Soulless One, allowing every &lt;a href=\"Soul%20Shriven\"&gt;Soul Shriven&lt;/a&gt; enslaved by Molag Bal to return to &lt;a href=\"Nirn\"&gt;Nirn&lt;/a&gt;. \nHero of Daggerfall.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Hero%20of%20Daggerfall\"&gt;Hero of Daggerfall&lt;/a&gt; received the &lt;a href=\"Mace%20of%20Molag%20Bal%20%28Daggerfall%29\"&gt;Mace of Molag Bal&lt;/a&gt; in exchange for eliminating a heretic mage or priest, respectively.\nHero of Kvatch.\nMolag Bal was &lt;a href=\"summon\"&gt;summon&lt;/a&gt;ed by the &lt;a href=\"Hero%20of%20Kvatch\"&gt;Hero&lt;/a&gt;. He wanted the Champion to corrupt &lt;a href=\"Melus%20Petilius\"&gt;Melus Petilius&lt;/a&gt; by forcing him to kill with the &lt;a href=\"Cursed%20Mace\"&gt;Cursed Mace&lt;/a&gt;. The Champion was able to enrage Petilius causing him to grab the Cursed Mace and use it to kill the Champion. Right before the final blow, Molag Bal transported the Champion back to his shrine and, pleased with a job well done, gave him the &lt;a href=\"Mace%20of%20Molag%20Bal%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;Mace of Molag Bal&lt;/a&gt;.\nDragonborn.\nDuring the Fourth Era, the &lt;a href=\"Last%20Dragonborn\"&gt;Dragonborn&lt;/a&gt; helped a &lt;a href=\"Vigilant%20of%20Stendarr\"&gt;Vigilant of Stendarr&lt;/a&gt; named &lt;a href=\"Tyranus\"&gt;Tyranus&lt;/a&gt; to investigate suspicious activity at an abandoned house in &lt;a href=\"Markarth%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Markarth&lt;/a&gt;. After arriving in the house, Molag Bal forced them to fight each other resulting in Tyranus's death. Upon speaking with the Daedric Prince, he promised the Dragonborn his &lt;a href=\"Mace%20of%20Molag%20Bal%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;mace&lt;/a&gt; if they returned Logrolf the Willful, a priest of &lt;a href=\"Boethiah\"&gt;Boethiah&lt;/a&gt; to the abandoned house and made him pledge his soul to Molag Bal. The Dragonborn then killed the priest with Molag Bal's mace on his altar.\nVampirism.\nCreator and patron deity.\nThe Dunmeri Temple's doctrine, \"&lt;a href=\"Vampires%20of%20Vvardenfell%2C%20v%20II\"&gt;Vampires of Vvardenfell, v II&lt;/a&gt;\", states that the Daedric Prince Molag Bal is the father of vampires. It is recorded in his \"&lt;a href=\"Private%20Papers%20of%20Galur%20Rithari%2C%20Buoyant%20Armiger\"&gt;Private Papers of Galur Rithari, Buoyant Armiger&lt;/a&gt;.\" Somehow, the Dunmeri Temple keeps this record from the world, for no clear reason.\nMolag Bal as the father of Vampirism is also recorded in the book called \"&lt;a href=\"Opusculus%20Lamae%20Bal%20ta%20Mezzamortie\"&gt;Opusculus Lamae Bal ta Mezzamortie&lt;/a&gt;.\" The book tells a story of Molag Bal, who, in his hatred towards &lt;a href=\"Arkay\"&gt;Arkay&lt;/a&gt;, profaned the body of a virgin &lt;a href=\"Nedic\"&gt;Nedic&lt;/a&gt; woman, &lt;a href=\"Lamae%20Beolfag\"&gt;Lamae Beolfag&lt;/a&gt;. Lamae was killed by the ordeal, but rose from the dead as Lamae Bal, as well as the Blood Matron and the First Vampire.\nPure-blooded vampires are those who were granted vampirism directly from Molag Bal, the creator and patron deity of Vampires. The process is somewhat similar to the creation of the first vampire, &lt;a href=\"Lamae%20Beolfag\"&gt;Lamae Beolfag&lt;/a&gt;\u2014mortals gain their vampirism through a ritual in which members of a family pledge themselves to Molag Bal. Women who survive the horrific ordeal, such as Serana and her mother &lt;a href=\"Valerica\"&gt;Valerica&lt;/a&gt;, are dubbed \"Daughters of Coldharbour.\"\n&lt;a href=\"Galur%20Rithari\"&gt;Galur Rithari&lt;/a&gt;, one of the &lt;a href=\"Buoyant%20Armigers%20%28Morrowind%29\"&gt;Buoyant Armigers&lt;/a&gt;, was cured of vampirism by Molag Bal.\nEvolution.\nThe Vampires of &lt;a href=\"Iliac%20Bay\"&gt;Iliac Bay&lt;/a&gt; and Vvardenfell are easily recognized by the average person, but this is not entirely true for &lt;a href=\"Cyrodiil\"&gt;Cyrodilic&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"vampires\"&gt;vampires&lt;/a&gt;\u2014obviously due to different blood. The Cyrodilic vampires have three states of vampire form, dependent on the time since feeding. When well fed, Cyrodilic vampires are rarely recognized by ordinary people and can even walk in daylight.\nWhen they are starving, however, all of a Cyrodilic vampire's vampiric traits are apparent and cannot be disguised. This unique trait of Cyrodilic vampires, according to \"&lt;a href=\"Manifesto%20Cyrodiil%20Vampyrum\"&gt;Manifesto Cyrodiil Vampyrum&lt;/a&gt;\", was a gift from &lt;a href=\"Clavicus%20Vile\"&gt;Clavicus Vile&lt;/a&gt;. As a result, the Cyrodilic vampires worship Molag Bal and Clavicus Vile.\nQuotes.\n&lt;a href=\"Dark%20Anchors\"&gt;Dark Anchors&lt;/a&gt;:.\nWhen a boss is summoned:\nWhen an anchor is destroyed:"}

After reaching the &lt;a href=\"White-Gold%20Tower%20Pinnacle\"&gt;White-Gold Tower Pinnacle&lt;/a&gt;, she reveals herself as Molag Kena, and will fight the Vestige. After she is killed, the Elder Scroll she stole is picked up by Terran, and a portal opens up back to &lt;a href=\"Tamriel\"&gt;Tamriel&lt;/a&gt;.\nCombat.\nAfter transforming, Kena can be found within an orb of lightning, powered by three &lt;a href=\"Lightning%20Aspect\"&gt;Lightning Aspect&lt;/a&gt;s.

She will later summon the Lightning Aspects once again and release waves of lightning. Powerful waves will knock the Vestige backwards, and can push them into the boundary surrounding the pinnacle that can turn them to ash. Once she is killed, a portal is opened back to &lt;a href=\"Green%20Emperor%20Way%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Green Emperor Way&lt;/a&gt;.\nEach time shockwave she releases in the middle of the arena will push the group back somewhat more than the previous one. This means that players must defeat her within a certain amount of time. "}

Whereas the Monk seems like a peaceful and - truly - difficult class to play, it has the ideal advantages of being a hybrid class, specializing in melee, ranged combat and spellcasting. Most notably, they can fulfill the role of a Thief, Warrior or Archer, all in one. Leveling a Monk is somewhat difficult due to the different kinds of major skills, but if one switches the use of weapons and spells frequently, playing as a Monk can be quite entertaining.\nA Monk fights either at close range with his or her fists or afar with their bows. Learning to switch between the two is what it takes to be a good Monk. On the downside, in melee Monks have no armor mastery and must rely on Alteration for protection and using fists needs a good speed to cope with, so if they manage to dodge successfully whilst hitting the opponent enough times, the target also loses Fatigue. At times, this and quick reflexes can be a key factor, since a Monk will not have much health to go along. Thanks to mastery in sneaking, Monks can also dispatch their foes from a crouching position with a well-aimed bow shot.\nAll in all, the Monk is a character for those who are good at dodging and like to vary their combat techniques. Paired with the &lt;a href=\"Thief%20%28Birthsign%29\"&gt;Thief&lt;/a&gt; Birthsign, this class excels in a profession less holier-than-thou than the title of the class pertains. The Monk is not burdened by most weapons and all armor-which will leave your inventory ripe for the picking of &lt;a href=\"stolen\"&gt;stolen&lt;/a&gt; loot and merchandise. This will come in handy for side quests involving the &lt;a href=\"Thieves%20Guild%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;Thieves Guild&lt;/a&gt;.\n&lt;a href=\"Khajiit%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;Khajiit&lt;/a&gt; make the perfect Monks, as they have a bonus to Hand-to-Hand, Athletics, and Acrobatics. It can also be proven as a viable class for other, although less gifted races, such as &lt;a href=\"Nords%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;Nords&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Dunmer%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;Dunmer&lt;/a&gt;, for their &lt;a href=\"Strength%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;Strength&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Speed%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;Speed&lt;/a&gt; attributes, respectively. &lt;a href=\"Bosmer%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;Bosmer&lt;/a&gt; character's could technically also be considered, though their skills in Marksman leave much better pre-made classes to be desired."}

Also known as the Crystal-Like-Law, the tower, contrary to the beliefs of those who live beyond our cherished borders is not made of crystal. No, the tower is named for the crystal that resides at the utmost level, &lt;a href=\"Transparent%20Law\"&gt;Transparent Law&lt;/a&gt;.\nTransparent Law lends power and energy to the Crystal Tower, which allows the mystical structure to offer its protections to all of Summerset. The energy radiates from the tower, spreading across the land like an invisible awning to keep the island safe and secure.\nNow, these protections are ancient and were set in place long ago when the crystal was within the tower by the &lt;a href=\"Aldmer\"&gt;Aldmer&lt;/a&gt; who erected it. In truth, for all our knowledge, the Sapiarchs do not fully understand the exact workings of the tower of the crystal. We know that the Aldmer constructed the Crystal Tower to preserve the graves of the early Aldmeri settlers and forever remember the spirit of the Elven people and mark that brief moment in history when we were fully unified.\nAs for the significance of Transparent Law, I should think that to be self evident. One only has to break down the meaning of the name and all becomes clear. To be transparent is to be easily recognized or detected, to be made manifest, to be open, obvious, and candid. Law, meanwhile, refers to the principles and regulations that govern some specific portion of reality. In this case, the crystal manifests the clear and unequivocal fundamental principles of our Aldmer heritage. Indeed, we suspect that the crystal may even be a fragment of divinity given physical substance.\nObviously, theories concerning the Transparent Law and its significant to the Crystal Tower abound within the &lt;a href=\"College%20of%20Sapiarchs\"&gt;College of Sapiarchs&lt;/a&gt;. I like to believe that the crystal absorbs the drive for perfection that marks the Altmer and reflects it back, driving away any imperfections that would weaken or endanger the island. Not everyone agrees with me, but I see a correlation between the pride and admiration our people feel for the Crystal Tower and the feeling of security and safety that it, in turn, projects across the land. It is a symbiotic relationship.\nOr, it could just be ancient Aldmer magic. Who can really say?"}

After letting Astrid know of the findings, the Dragonborn is instructed to kill Cicero. She provides the horse, Shadowmere, as a means of getting to him. Despite the fact that Shadowmere is unique in appearance, choosing to obtain it is not essential to completing the quest.\nWhile in the Sanctuary, talking with &lt;a href=\"Nazir\"&gt;Nazir&lt;/a&gt; can also provide additional available side contracts.\nTracking Cicero.\nOutside the Sanctuary is a black pool that resolves itself into Shadowmere. He can be ridden to Dawnstar or else the Dragonborn can &lt;a href=\"Fast%20Travel%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;fast travel&lt;/a&gt; there. Once there, Arnbjorn is sitting injured on the ground just outside of the Dawnstar Sanctuary. He tells of his injuries, saying they were from a fight with Cicero, but that he injured Cicero equally as seriously, so the Dragonborn should just \"follow the blood\" to find him. After suggesting that he return to the home Sanctuary, Dawnstar Sanctuary should be entered.\nOnce inside, Cicero can be heard asking whether the &lt;a href=\"Listener\"&gt;Listener&lt;/a&gt; has come, and then saying that Astrid has sent her best. There is a full set of the &lt;a href=\"Jester%27s%20Outfit\"&gt;Jester's Outfit&lt;/a&gt; on a table to the left as you enter the first room. As the Dragonborn continues, you will come to a bridge with a spear trap. As the trap is triggered, Cicero taunts the Dragonborn. It is possible to lure the Sanctuary Guardian to the other side of the bridge into the spike trap. Continuing on, at the bottom of a circular set of stairs is a table with the &lt;a href=\"Archery%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Archery&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Skill%20Books%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;skill book&lt;/a&gt; \"&lt;a href=\"The%20Marksmanship%20Lesson\"&gt;The Marksmanship Lesson&lt;/a&gt;\" and the &lt;a href=\"One-Handed%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;one-handed&lt;/a&gt; skill book \"&lt;a href=\"Fire%20and%20Darkness\"&gt;Fire and Darkness&lt;/a&gt;\", as well as a set of &lt;a href=\"Worn%20Shrouded%20Armor\"&gt;Worn Shrouded Armor&lt;/a&gt; on a cupboard to the right. In the very next room, along with the &lt;a href=\"Sanctuary%20Guardian\"&gt;Sanctuary Guardian&lt;/a&gt;s, is a fire trap. Cicero continues his commentary as the Dragonborn proceeds.\nThe next room contains a set of steps in the southwest corner leading up to a gate of metal poles that can be opened by pulling a chain near the bottom of the stairs. This opens a large round opening in the northeast wall, and a door in the southeast corner. The stairs lead back to an earlier part of the path, so they should be ignored for now. The southeast door is barred from the other side. The round opening leads to an ice cave (which Cicero calls a \"forced addition\").\nDeeper into the cave you will find the unique troll &lt;a href=\"Udefrykte%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Udefrykte&lt;/a&gt;, along with numerous dead animals and bear traps. There is a ledge on the left side with a ramp leading to a chest containing a meager amount of coins. Continuing on through the bottom level of the cave, you will come to a room with a wooden door that leads to a retracting pole gate (the chain to open it is on the wall to the right). At the bottom of the stairs is a hallway with coffins on either side. The coffins are mostly empty - a few have bloody rags or skulls, though some may have &lt;a href=\"Bone%20Meal\"&gt;Bone Meal&lt;/a&gt;. There is a master-locked chest in a dead end passageway to the left (south) with leveled loot. At the end, another set of stairs leads up to the right (north) to another retracting pole gate opened by a chain to the right. At the end of this hall is the barred door to the left (that can now be opened) and another door to the right that leads to Cicero. As the Dragonborn approaches, they sheath their weapon(s).\nConfronting Cicero.\nCicero is found lying on the ground injured. He asks that his life be spared and that the Dragonborn lie to Astrid about killing him. Should the Dragonborn decide to let him live, there is no effect on the outcome of the quest nor the attitudes of the other Brotherhood members. It should be noted that if Cicero is spared in this quest he will become an available follower for the Dragonborn. If he is killed, his body can be looted for his &lt;a href=\"Cicero%27s%20Outfit\"&gt;outfit&lt;/a&gt; (the Jester's Outfit on the table at the entrance is less powerful), some gold and a leveled dagger. If he is attacked, he will get up and fight back, revealing that he isn't actually injured.\nConclusion.\nReturn to Astrid and inform (or lie to) her about Cicero's death. She will then thank the Dragonborn and suggest they hold on to Shadowmere \"a while longer,\" in addition to starting the next quest, \"&lt;a href=\"Recipe%20for%20Disaster\"&gt;Recipe for Disaster&lt;/a&gt;.\""}

He called himself &lt;a href=\"Beela-Kaar\"&gt;Beela-Kaar&lt;/a&gt;, and he was both admired and feared for the arcane energy he wielded.\nAccording to the oral stories the elders tell, Beela-Kaar served as a trusted advisor to the &lt;a href=\"Saxhleel\"&gt;Saxhleel&lt;/a&gt; leaders, using his magic to help the people of &lt;a href=\"Murkmire\"&gt;Murkmire&lt;/a&gt;. However, when his beloved mate succumbed to a terrible wasting disease, Beela-Kaar secluded himself to search for an alchemical cure or a spell that would reverse the illness. After exhausting every possibility that utilized conventional magic, Beela-Kaar turned to the darker aspects of the arcane arts, including foul necromancy to save his mate.\nAlthough the sorcerer was unable to eliminate the disease, he used the dark arts to reanimate his mate's corporeal form, and his beloved companion remained at his side as a mindless zombie. The Argonians saw this as an abomination and pleaded with Beela-Kaar to let his mate rest in peace. The sorcerer ignored them and took control of one of the xanmeers, using it as a laboratory to conduct increasingly darker experiments with &lt;a href=\"Necromancy\"&gt;necromantic&lt;/a&gt; spells and rituals. It was during this period that Beela-Kaar came to be known as \"the mad sorcerer.\"\nWhen a few of the mad sorcerer's vile creations escaped from the xanmeer and ravaged through the region, the elders of Murkmire finally took action. They sent a band of warriors to confront Beela-Kaar and put an end to his dark rituals. The sorcerer's xanmeer was defended, however, and a siege began that lasted for thirty-three days and thirty-three nights. Many Saxhleel warriors fell to Beela-Kaar's dark spells, only to rise again as undead abominations to attack their comrades. The Murkmire warriors never faltered, however, and called upon mages of their own to assault the xanmeer. It was a long and costly battle.\nAs the tide turned, the mad sorcerer realized that his xanmeer would soon fall. In anticipation, he conducted one last ritual. He directed all of his considerable power inward, turning his remains into an artifact. The ritual consumed his body, leaving nothing behind but his skull, which had become solid gold. In addition to his power and possibly his sentience, the skull was imbued with a terrible curse. If unleashed, the curse would destroy Murkmire, giving Beela-Kaar revenge for the various indignities he believed were heaped upon him.\nTo protect themselves, the Murkmire elders took the &lt;a href=\"Golden%20Skull%20of%20Beela-Kaar\"&gt;Golden Skull of Beela-Kaar&lt;/a&gt; and locked it away in a hidden xanmeer on a &lt;a href=\"Norg-Tzel\"&gt;forbidden island&lt;/a&gt;. The legend of the mad sorcerer and the threat of the curse remain to the current day."}

Atub, the wise woman of the tribe, has asked me to find her a bowl of Troll Fat and a Daedra Heart so that she may contact the Daedric Lord Malacath for guidance.\"\nWalkthrough.\n&lt;a href=\"Largashbur\"&gt;Largashbur&lt;/a&gt; is an Orcish stronghold found near the &lt;a href=\"Jerall%20Mountains\"&gt;Jerall Mountains&lt;/a&gt; in the south of &lt;a href=\"The%20Rift%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;The Rift&lt;/a&gt; region. As the stronghold is approached, the tribe of orcs will be engaged in battle with a giant. If &lt;a href=\"Ugor\"&gt;Ugor&lt;/a&gt;, one of the orcs fighting the giant, dies when entering the stronghold, then starting the quest will be more difficult. However, if she is rescued, the quest will be much easier depending on how quickly the giant is slain. If it is not possible to save Ugor, one of the following tactics will allow access to the stronghold:\nWith the general exception of other Orcs, Orc tribes will initially be mistrustful of outsiders. Chief Yamarz, the tribe's chief, has become weak and cursed. The giants have taken advantage of this, assailing the stronghold regularly, as well as overtaking the shrine of the Daedric Prince Malacath. Atub asks for Troll Fat and a Daedra Heart to use as an offering to Malacath, the patron Daedra of the &lt;a href=\"Orsimer%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Orsimer&lt;/a&gt;, in hopes that he might respond to the wise woman's prayers and guide the tribe in their time of need.\nIf the Dragonborn fast travels back to Lagashbur after receiving the quest from Atub, two dragons may spawn. If this happens before \"&lt;a href=\"Dragon%20Rising\"&gt;Dragon Rising&lt;/a&gt;\" has completed, the giant will respawn instead.\nRetrieving the ingredients.\nAtub will accept stolen ingredients.\nFallowstone Cave.\nChief Yamarz must be protected while traveling through Fallowstone Cave, located northeast of &lt;a href=\"Riften%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Riften&lt;/a&gt;, to the &lt;a href=\"Giant%27s%20Grove\"&gt;Giant's Grove&lt;/a&gt; on the other side. Cave bears and trolls could be encountered in addition to giants. While Yamarz is well-equipped with full Orcish Armor and an Orcish weapon and can handle himself well in battle, he will still find himself outmatched when fighting giants by himself. Yamarz prefers melee attacks, so it may be best to hang back and pelt the gigantic enemies with arrows or magic while being careful not to attack the Orc Chief; it is easy to accidentally hit Yamarz taking on the giants. It is possible to run ahead of Chief Yamarz, clear the cave out before he even gets there, and leave the cave. Then after fast traveling back to Lagashbur, the whole tribe will attack him, killing him, and Malacath's voice will be heard saying that giants killed him. Also, even though Atub was part of the attackers, she will still ask what happened to him.\nGiant's Grove.\nAt the Giant's Grove, Yamarz will ask the Dragonborn to retrieve the giant chieftain's hammer for him. He promises gold in return for the Dragonborn's discretion; the tribe never has to know that their chief was not the one to return the giant's club, Shagrol's Warhammer.\nIf the Dragonborn refuses, Yamarz will attack the giant himself and die quickly\u2014\"This should only take a second,\" are Yamarz's prophetic last words\u2014and it is up to the Dragonborn to defeat the giant. If the Dragonborn takes the bribe and defeats the giant for Chief Yamarz, he will then attack the Dragonborn to ensure his tribe never learns of his cowardice.\nDefeat the giant.\nRegardless of which option is chosen, the quest log will only show the text for the option to kill the giant instead of letting Yamarz kill it."}

They hired a group of mercenaries called the &lt;a href=\"The%20Daggers\"&gt;Daggers&lt;/a&gt; to help them with their research, but the Daggers never returned from the &lt;a href=\"Shrieking%20Scar\"&gt;Shrieking Scar&lt;/a&gt;.\nWalkthrough.\nLord Diel explains one of the Daggers did in fact make it back to camp, and he suggests to talk to him to get more information. Head over to Bumnog who is waiting nearby. He tells the\u00a0&lt;a href=\"Vestige\"&gt;Vestige&lt;/a&gt; this is the first job they got and now the rest of them are missing. They need to be found so the mission will be a success. We need to collect harpy eggs to help Gelvin, our leader, and the Remly brothers to finish their jobs. We also need to locate Foulwing, the harpy queen, and kill her.\nFollow the marker to find Gelvin, who has by accident got himself trapped in one of the traps set by &lt;a href=\"Armel%20Remly\"&gt;Armel Remly&lt;/a&gt;. He first won't accept they need help, but then says they haven't a clue what they are doing and will appreciate any help they can get. He has one unhatched harpy egg but Lord Diel needs a few more.\nEggs can be found in the nests above, follow the marker to find them. The area is full with harpies who attack on sight, and some will drop eggs when killed. Gelvin said he would head back to camp after a rest and that they should meet there when the job is finished.\nOn top of the Shrieking Scar, the harpy queen Foulwing is waiting. Defeat her with the help of Bumnog then follow the marker to find the Remly brothers who are setting out traps. Although &lt;a href=\"Balin%20Remly\"&gt;Balin&lt;/a&gt; says he has nothing to report to the Lord except his brother is an idiot. Armel has set dozens of traps but just now realized harpies fly and don't walk. He explains they are trying to capture a few harpies so the Lord can observe them and find out why they behave as they do.\nThey also have throwing snares but the harpies need to be weakened before using them, and they are no fighters. He hands over some snares to the Vestige so they can do the job. Find some more harpies, and fight them and use the snares to capture them.\nAfter a number of harpies have been captured, return to camp. Halfway there, it turns out Bumnog wants to have a talk. He is concerned they won't get payed for the job as he is suspicious of Lord Diel. Head back to camp after he has finished talking.\nAt the camp the captured harpies lie screaming on a line and Lord Diel is watching over them. He at once see that Gelvin isn't back with them and when he gets the eggs he is a bit annoyed. One egg is missing, it's the one Gelvin was to bring back. He gets very angry and points the Vestige to Granette, Gelvin's sister. \"Tell her if he doesn't get back he will cut his right hand off from stealing from a noble.\"\nGranette says she had her doubts about the Lord from the start and hopes for more help from the Vestige. She thinks she knows where her brother has gone, and mentions a fishing cabin where they first met Lord Diel.\nFollow the marker to the fishing cabin and enter to find Gelvin. He says he was on his way back to camp when he decided to investigate the cabin. He hasn't found anything yet but searching around the room, some clues are found. Finally a &lt;a href=\"Contract%20with%20House%20Diel\"&gt;contract&lt;/a&gt; is found that explains the Lord has orchestrated the entire harpy threat to increase his own profits and reputation.\nAfter either telling Gelvin to finish the job or confront Lord Diel, go outside to talk to the Lord if they agree to deal with him. He is very angry and depending what was done earlier, either give him the last egg or not and determine the fate of the Lord and the end of the quest. The reward will be a large sum of and a pair of &lt;a href=\"Dagger%27s%20Combat%20Stompers\"&gt;Dagger's Combat Stompers&lt;/a&gt;."}

It was founded and lead by &lt;a href=\"Gelvin%20Feldrin\"&gt;Gelvin Feldrin&lt;/a&gt;. Unlike many other bands of mercenaries, the Daggers kept themselves on the right side of the law at all times.\nAlthough at a later date the group stopped using the name for themselves as they received strange messages and threats by somebody else who had suppository used the name for themselves before the mercenaries even united.\n\u200bHistory.\nThe Daggers were formed from peddlers and drunkards of Daggerfall during the &lt;a href=\"Three%20Banners%20War\"&gt;Three Banners War&lt;/a&gt;. Those who were not accepted by the &lt;a href=\"Fighters%20Guild%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Fighters Guild&lt;/a&gt; or the &lt;a href=\"City%20Guard\"&gt;City Guard&lt;/a&gt;, decided to join their forces and prove themselves to be worth something. They were united by a &lt;a href=\"Bretons%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Breton&lt;/a&gt; by the name of Galvin Feldrin.\nShortly after the formation of the band, the mercenaries were celebrating in &lt;a href=\"The%20Rosy%20Lion\"&gt;The Rosy Lion&lt;/a&gt;. People from the &lt;a href=\"House%20Diel\"&gt;House Diel&lt;/a&gt; approached them to offer them their first contract. The Daggers were tasked to help &lt;a href=\"Lord%20Alain%20Diel\"&gt;Lord Alain Diel&lt;/a&gt; with an investigation into &lt;a href=\"Harpy%20%28Online%29\"&gt;harpies&lt;/a&gt; infesting the &lt;a href=\"Shrieking%20Scar\"&gt;Shrieking Scar&lt;/a&gt;, who had become more aggressive than usual.\nThe first job didn't go as smoothly as expected as the members of the group were not experienced. Lord Diel became impatient and hired &lt;a href=\"Vestige\"&gt;Vestige&lt;/a&gt;. Some members of the Daggers began to doubt Lord Diel's motives and eventually uncovered that the House Diel had caused the chaos themselves for personal profit. Lord Diel threatened the mercenaries, but could not overpower them.\nThe Daggers exposed Diel plan to the city of Daggerfall gaining some renown in the city and becoming known as experts on harpies. The Daggers later traveled in search of employment and found that the Fighters Guild had stopped doing minor jobs and started to focus on the &lt;a href=\"Daedra%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Daedra&lt;/a&gt; infestations. This allowed the Daggers to find some jobs here and there gaining more and more renown.\nEventually the Daggers found themselves in the &lt;a href=\"Rivenspire\"&gt;Rivenspire&lt;/a&gt;, Gelvin and &lt;a href=\"Granette%20Feldrin\"&gt;Granette&lt;/a&gt; went to &lt;a href=\"Shornhelm%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Shornhelm&lt;/a&gt; in search of more jobs, while &lt;a href=\"Bumnog\"&gt;Bumnog&lt;/a&gt; and the Remly brothers were hired by the &lt;a href=\"Horsemen\"&gt;Horsemen&lt;/a&gt; to help with their own harpy infestation.\nAn invention of the Remly brothers - a scent that lured the harpies into traps accidentally caused a harpy invasion of the Horsemen village.

In order to frame Volf for a crime he didn't commit, Erikur is requesting that a substance called Balmora Blue be stashed on board in the captain's footlocker.\"\nWalkthrough.\nAfter completing at least five &lt;a href=\"Thieves%20Guild%20%28Skyrim%29%23Small%20Jobs\"&gt;small jobs&lt;/a&gt; for the &lt;a href=\"Thieves%20Guild%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Thieves Guild&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Solitude%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Solitude&lt;/a&gt;, speak to &lt;a href=\"Delvin%20Mallory%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Delvin Mallory&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"The%20Ragged%20Flagon\"&gt;The Ragged Flagon&lt;/a&gt;. There, he will inform the &lt;a href=\"Last%20Dragonborn\"&gt;Dragonborn&lt;/a&gt; of a \"special job\" in Solitude. The Dragonborn is directed to speak with &lt;a href=\"Erikur\"&gt;Erikur&lt;/a&gt;, a wealthy thane and businessman who lives in the city.\nErikur.\nTravel to the &lt;a href=\"Blue%20Palace%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Blue Palace&lt;/a&gt; in Solitude and speak with Erikur. He may be at his home if it is late at night. It is not advisable to &lt;a href=\"Lockpicking%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;break into&lt;/a&gt; his house, which may lower the relationship rank. It is better to wait until morning, where he can be found in the Blue Palace with Jarl Elisif and her other thane, Bryling.\nHe is not particularly polite, and seems to doubt the Dragonborn's skills, saying that he demanded Delvin's best man for this job. By speaking further with him, Erikur will eventually tell the Dragonborn that a ship captain called &lt;a href=\"Volf\"&gt;Volf&lt;/a&gt; cheated him over a business transaction. Volf is in charge of a ship called the &lt;a href=\"Dainty%20Sload\"&gt;Dainty Sload&lt;/a&gt;, and Erikur asks the Dragonborn to frame him for a crime.\nHe then directs the Dragonborn to plant an illegal drug known as &lt;a href=\"Balmora%20Blue\"&gt;Balmora Blue&lt;/a&gt; in the captain's footlocker inside the ship. The duo conspire to frame Volf for possession of an illicit substance, so Volf will be promptly sent off to, and rot in, the Castle Dour dungeons as punishment.\nSabine Nytte.\nThe next stop is the &lt;a href=\"Red%20Wave\"&gt;Red Wave&lt;/a&gt;, docked in Solitude's harbor outside the &lt;a href=\"East%20Empire%20Company%20Warehouse\"&gt;East Empire Company Warehouse&lt;/a&gt;. On the deck or somewhere inside the ship is Sabine Nytte, who claims to be the only one who can obtain Balmora Blue, who is easily identified by her &lt;a href=\"Steel%20Plate%20Armor\"&gt;Steel Plate Armor&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Battleaxes%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;battleaxe&lt;/a&gt;. She will sell its location and the key for 1500 . The location and key can be purchased or stolen. By choosing the purchase option, skip the rest of this section and see the Acquire Balmora Blue section below.\nIf the Balmora Blue is to be stolen, Sabine Nytte has two keys that can be used in the quest. Pickpocket her for either or both the keys, or &lt;a href=\"Lockpicking%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;pick the locks&lt;/a&gt; instead.\nA safe containing a note about the Balmora Blue is in the bottom-most deck of the Red Wave. Pick the Master lock or use Sabine's key to open it. The note reads, \"I stashed the Balmora Blue in a chest under the Wave. I put the best lock on it that money can buy.\"\nAcquiring the Balmora Blue.\nThe chest is in the water directly beneath the dock running parallel to the Red Wave. It can be lockpicked (&lt;a href=\"Lock%20Level\"&gt;Expert&lt;/a&gt;) or opened with another key pickpocketed from Sabine, unless she gives it willingly by payment. Once the Balmora Blue is acquired, the next stop is the Dainty Sload. Erikur may try to speak to the Dragonborn after leaving the docks. It is not necessary to speak to him if he does not.\nPlanting the Balmora Blue.\nHead for the Dainty Sload, anchored out towards open water near the &lt;a href=\"Solitude%20Lighthouse\"&gt;Solitude Lighthouse&lt;/a&gt;. There are two &lt;a href=\"Corsair%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;corsairs&lt;/a&gt; guarding the entrance to the interior of the ship. Either defeat them or sneak past them. To remain undetected, wait until the patrolling corsair disappears behind the cabin and slip through the unlocked door. Inside, there are more corsairs to deal with. With a high enough &lt;a href=\"Sneak%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Sneak&lt;/a&gt;, it is fairly easy to sneak past the guards, and the first two can be avoided by removing the nearby torch from its scone to darken the area. Go down the stairs into the bottom of the ship, then back up the other side.\nThe ship's &lt;a href=\"First%20Mate\"&gt;First Mate&lt;/a&gt; stands near the objective, the Captain's Footlocker. Pick the Adept lock on the footlocker, or defeat or pickpocket the First Mate for the key. Plant the Balmora Blue and go back to the entrance. Note that there is a &lt;a href=\"Stone%20of%20Barenziah\"&gt;Stone of Barenziah&lt;/a&gt; on the table near the First Mate, and an Adept-level chest opposite the top of the stairs. There is also an unlocked chest by the door to the outside.\nConclusion.\nTravel back to Erikur at the Blue Palace. He will reward the Dragonborn with a random leveled &lt;a href=\"Spell%20Tomes%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Spell Tome&lt;/a&gt;, and the assurance that he will \"re-open any doors the Guild needs for its return\". Return to the Ragged Flagon, where Delvin is waiting for the news. Speak to him to end the quest.\nWhen the quest is completed, Delvin will mention that the Thieves Guild is making progress. As a result, there will be a new merchant or service in one of the alcoves of the Flagon. Part of the Cistern will also be renovated."}

When the scene has faded out there is a &lt;a href=\"Curano%27s%20Journal\"&gt;discarded journal&lt;/a&gt; left on the ground.\nOne by one of the ancient ones suffers and dies, shown in more ghostly scenes, and journals are left behind. &lt;a href=\"Lanath%27s%20Journal\"&gt;Lanath's Journal&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Valasha%27s%20Journal\"&gt;Valasha's Journal&lt;/a&gt;. After reading them, find Sees-All-Colors and update her with the journals. There where two cities, one worshipped &lt;a href=\"Meridia\"&gt;Meridia&lt;/a&gt;, the other &lt;a href=\"Molag%20Bal\"&gt;Molag Bal&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href=\"Abagarlas\"&gt;Abagarlas&lt;/a&gt;, the city of dead, creates a relic to strike at the Meridians, &lt;a href=\"Delodiil\"&gt;Delodiil&lt;/a&gt;, city of light, creates their own weapon, forged around a heart of crystal.\nThe journals describes the ancient ones stole into the heart of the enemy with this crystal weapon, stopped the ritual and their king ends the dark rule of Abagarlas. They felt hunted and hid the crystal heart and a tome with instructions on how to make the weapon, spoken about in the journal, here in Mzeneldt. The priestess of Meridia gave her life and relit the crystal so the weapon could one day be forged.\nContinue searching the ruin and in the next room another scene appears with the last two of the explorers fighting Dwemer spiders and a Dwemer sphere. There is only one survivor and on the ground &lt;a href=\"Endarre%27s%20Log\"&gt;Endarre's Log&lt;/a&gt; will appear after the scene fades away. Reading the log will give the Vestige the hint in how to open the large doors. Collecting five Dwarven crystals, held by the nearby guardian constructs and place them in the special sockets near the doors. When all crystals are placed in the sockets, a light will go from each up to the doors and this will open them.\nWhen inside a final ghostly scene is appearing with the ancient one fighting a &lt;a href=\"Dwarven%20Centurion%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Dwarven Centurion&lt;/a&gt;. The scene fades and leaves a last journal on the ground. After reading it, the crystal heart, the prismatic core, and the tome can be found in the chest nearby. After retrieving the artifacts a Dwarven Centurion activates and the Vestige must defeat it before returning to the guildmaster. She instructs them to give the items to &lt;a href=\"Merric%20at-Aswala%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Merric&lt;/a&gt;, creates a portal back and tells them she has urgent business to take care of.\nBefore the Vestige can walk through the portal, &lt;a href=\"Jofnir%20Iceblade\"&gt;Jofnir Iceblade&lt;/a&gt; appears and he has something important to tell. He tells the Vestige they are in danger, he can't fully comprehend them, even in death. He implies someone near them will betray them and warns them to be careful before fading away.\nAfter walking through the portal back to the Fighters Guildhall, Merric is waiting for the artifacts. Hand them over and he will start with his research on them at once. He also hands a reward over to the Vestige with an excuse from the guildmaster, she had urgent matters to attend to and regrets she couldn't stay."}

The Moon Beast. Born of the &lt;a href=\"Heart%20of%20Lorkhan\"&gt;dark heart&lt;/a&gt; of Lorkhaj, which overcame him after he suffered a great betrayal. In his wisdom, Lorkhaj sought his sister &lt;a href=\"Azurah\"&gt;Azurah&lt;/a&gt;, who tore the darkness from him before it consumed him and cast it into the Void. We know this shade of Lorkhaj as the first of the &lt;a href=\"Dro-m%27Athra\"&gt;Dro-m'Athra&lt;/a&gt;, who serve the &lt;a href=\"Ur-Dra\"&gt;Ur-Dra&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Namiira\"&gt;Namiira&lt;/a&gt;, our enemy.

Know that on nights of the &lt;a href=\"Ghost%20Moon\"&gt;Ghost Moon&lt;/a&gt;, Azurah has opened the &lt;a href=\"Void%20Gate\"&gt;Void Gate&lt;/a&gt; and the Moon Beast will challenge mortals until banished. We accept this burden as part of the Path, and for the sake of our Lost Kin.\n&lt;a href=\"Namiira\"&gt;Namiira&lt;/a&gt;. The Eldest Spirit. The &lt;a href=\"Great%20Darkness\"&gt;Great Darkness&lt;/a&gt;. The Void. All creatures who feed on rotten flesh are her spies and the prey of Cats. The Lunar Lattice protects us from her hunger, but not our own. Know that to name her aloud is to invite the Dark, so you must never do so, as Namiira is the sound of her true name. She is a spirit of infinite realms, of which only Azurah knows all. Mortals who become ensnared by this spirit are tortured until they forget who they were and know only Namiira. This is eternal suffering for all souls but the &lt;a href=\"ja-Kha%27jay\"&gt;ja-Kha'jay&lt;/a&gt;, whom Azurah will not abandon to the Dark.\n&lt;a href=\"Noctra\"&gt;Noctra&lt;/a&gt;. The Shadow Thief. Daughter of Twilight. Born from the black blood of Lorkhaj at the steps of the Void Gate. In the songs, &lt;a href=\"Boethra\"&gt;Boethra&lt;/a&gt; battled this spirit until it knew it was not Namiira. When this was done, Noctra was brought before Azurah to be judged. Azurah showed mercy and allowed Noctra to live, so long as she served Azurah and the ja-Kha'jay. But Noctra is rebellious by nature, so she stole &lt;a href=\"Skeleton%20Key\"&gt;one of Azurah's keys&lt;/a&gt; and fled back into the Void. It is written that Azurah sent the true spirit of Lorkhaj to find her, and ever since Noctra has aided the Khajiit when called. Tribes may whisper to Noctra for silence, shade, and luck. Do not summon her to perform vile deeds, for this will bring the Dark with her.\n&lt;a href=\"Varmiina\"&gt;Varmiina&lt;/a&gt;. Queen of Nightmares. The Lost Daughter. This spirit was not of any litter, but was born from &lt;a href=\"Fadomai\"&gt;Fadomai&lt;/a&gt;'s fear of losing her children. Azurah killed this dark spirit in the &lt;a href=\"Underworld\"&gt;Underworld&lt;/a&gt;, and now Varmiina only haunts Khajiit when they dream. Know she will test you and make you want to turn from the Path in fear, but she cannot truly harm the ja-Kha'jay in dreams.\n[?????] A spirit of vengeance. It has no will of its own, as it was born from Azurah's grief after the death of Fadomai and Lorkhaj. None can summon this spirit save Azurah, Boethra, and &lt;a href=\"Mafala\"&gt;Mafala&lt;/a&gt;, for only they know its true name. It sometimes appears in songs as a black panther, a warrior in ebony armor, or as a hidden sword."}

It is &lt;a href=\"Mehrunes%20Dagon%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Mehrunes Dagon&lt;/a&gt;'s realm of &lt;a href=\"Oblivion\"&gt;Oblivion&lt;/a&gt; and is directly connected to the adjacent realm of &lt;a href=\"Fargrave\"&gt;Fargrave&lt;/a&gt; that serves as the region's centralized civilian population center. The Deadlands is a realm of fire and desolation, with servants of Dagon, both &lt;a href=\"Daedra%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Daedra&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Order%20of%20the%20Waking%20Flame\"&gt;cultists&lt;/a&gt;, occupying virtually every area of the region.\nBackground.\nThe Deadlands, serving as the domain of Mehrunes Dagon, hosts the legions of the Prince of Destruction who prepares to invade his self-proclaimed birth right of &lt;a href=\"Tamriel\"&gt;Tamriel&lt;/a&gt;. During the reign of the &lt;a href=\"Longhouse%20Emperors\"&gt;Longhouse Emperors&lt;/a&gt;, Dagon struck a deal to imbue his essence of four \"Ambitions\" that would grow in power. In &lt;a href=\"2E%20582\"&gt;2E 582&lt;/a&gt;, he began executing his plan to reabsorb the power from the Ambitions and give himself the power to invade Tamriel with little opposition.\nWith the &lt;a href=\"Order%20of%20the%20Waking%20Flame\"&gt;Order of the Waking Flame&lt;/a&gt; and legions of Daedra preparing to enact the final phase of Dagon's plan, the adjacent realm of Fargrave is under constant threat, as the realm's universal proximity to all other places, including &lt;a href=\"Nirn\"&gt;Nirn&lt;/a&gt;, has made it a target of the Prince of Destruction that would give him unprecedented reach throughout the &lt;a href=\"Aurbis\"&gt;Aurbis&lt;/a&gt; if it were to come under his control.\nLocations.\nThe following are locations accessible in the Deadlands and, with the exception of &lt;a href=\"Unmarked%20Locations%20%28Online%29\"&gt;unmarked locations&lt;/a&gt;, are discoverable on the map. Points of Interest serve as locations with unique side quests, while &lt;a href=\"Cities%20%28Online%29\"&gt;cities&lt;/a&gt; serve as the centralised areas with multiple sublocations and act as a hub for services and &lt;a href=\"Merchants%20%28Online%29\"&gt;merchants&lt;/a&gt;. Explanations of the types of locations are provided in the &lt;a href=\"Locations%20%28Online%29%23Types\"&gt;main locations page&lt;/a&gt;.\nQuests.\nThe Deadlands features a series of zone story quests and unrelated side quests. The zone story quests tie into the &lt;a href=\"Gates%20of%20Oblivion\"&gt;Gates of Oblivion&lt;/a&gt; overarching storyline and carries on from &lt;a href=\"Blackwood%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Blackwood&lt;/a&gt;, but it is not necessary to complete the story quests for zones prior to those in the Deadlands. Side quests are non-sequential and can be completed in any order, except where one carries on from another, and &lt;a href=\"repeatable%20quests\"&gt;repeatable quests&lt;/a&gt; can be completed multiple times: weekly for arenas and trials and daily for all others. Note that the Epilogue for the Gates of Oblivion requires the zone quests of both Blackwood and the Deadlands to have been completed before it can be started.\nItem Sets.\nItem sets are related armor and weapons that, when worn together, provide unique benefits. Overland sets can be acquired from world bosses, world events, delves, public dungeons and containers and as quest rewards; dungeon sets can be acquired from within group dungeons; monster sets can be acquired from the final boss of veteran group dungeons and Undaunted Enclaves; and crafted sets can be created at specific locations across the zone.\nSkyshards.\nFive Skyshards can be found in the Deadlands totaling in one &lt;a href=\"skill%20point\"&gt;skill point&lt;/a&gt; with two left over. The zone guide provides clues as to the location of each Skyshard, but many can be found simply by exploring and watching for the distinctive pillar of light they emit. Skyshards will appear on the map and compass when the Vestige is close to one and will remain discovered on the map even if it was not collected.\nAchievements.\nAchievements can be earned by completing specific tasks such as completing quests and discovering locations. Achievements are separated into categories and their progress is viewable from the journal. Earning achievement provides the Vestige a number of points, and some achievements unlock unique rewards such as &lt;a href=\"Furnishings%20%28Online%29\"&gt;furnishings&lt;/a&gt; that can be bought from Achievement Furnishers or &lt;a href=\"collectibles\"&gt;collectibles&lt;/a&gt;.\nShalidor's Library.\nTen books that are a part of Shalidor's Library can be found in the Deadlands and added to the collection. Books that have already been found in other zones will already be marked as completed in the zone tracker.\nFish.\nFish can be caught from fishing hotspots, ideally with the correct &lt;a href=\"bait\"&gt;bait&lt;/a&gt;. Common fish will be caught most often while rare fish and alternative bait are rare catches. Each zone has unique rare fish than can be caught from hotspots. &lt;a href=\"Slaughterfish%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Slaughterfish&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"trodh\"&gt;trodh&lt;/a&gt; can be caught from foul hotspots, &lt;a href=\"dhufish\"&gt;dhufish&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"longfin\"&gt;longfin&lt;/a&gt; can be caught from saltwater hotspots, &lt;a href=\"silverside%20perch\"&gt;silverside perch&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"spadetail\"&gt;spadetail&lt;/a&gt; can be caught from lake hotspots, and &lt;a href=\"Salmon%20%28Online%29\"&gt;salmon&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"River%20Betty%20%28Online%29\"&gt;river betty&lt;/a&gt; can be caught from river hotspots. &lt;a href=\"Chub\"&gt;Chub&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"minnow\"&gt;minnow&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"shad\"&gt;shad&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"fish%20roe\"&gt;fish roe&lt;/a&gt; can be caught and used as bait from foul, saltwater, lake and river hotspots, respectively. There are only foulwater sources in the Deadlands."}

If you fail to follow these steps as listed, I cannot guarantee your safety or return. Remember, you came to me, and you insisted.\nBefore you leave on the night you plan to set out, write your plea upon any scroll made from lamb hide and only lamb hide. If you value your sanity, keep your plea short and make sure there is no room for clever reinterpretation. He draws great pleasure from using your written words against you.\nNote: To write your plea, you must use the piece of charcoal I lent you. It was retrieved from a fire which was used by a one-legged lizardman to cook an albino deer. Good Luck finding another one.\nWith your plea written and the scroll and sacrifice in hand, approach the ring of stones on the third night of any month under the sign of the Lord, the Ritual, or the Tower. Any word spoken aloud will ensure your plea will not be heard, so come alone and stay silent.\nWait for any point where the clouds cover the moon and look for the pertinent creststone, which will vary based on the sign. You will know the creststone by the way it glows without the moonlight. Place the sacrifice we discussed before the stone, atop the scroll on which you've written your plea.\nThe next part is important and tricky, so rehearse ahead of time. Once the sacrifice is placed atop the scroll before the stone, you must draw the sigil on the stone (remember, only pig's blood is an acceptable medium) and finish drawing it before the moon shines again. Draw the sigil, stand, and wait.\nIf your plea will be heard, he'll come looking for you soon enough. If he doesn't come galloping out of a rock, before the moonlight returns, your attempt was a failure and you must wait until the next third day to try again, with a new sacrifice.\nAlso, since I know you're already thinking it, do not reuse your sacrifice! He will know, and there are few things that make him crankier. You do not want him to be cranky.\nFinally, on the night you go to petition him, do not wear anything purple. He finds the color alternately offensive and beguiling, depending on the day, and there's no telling how he might react to it. Trust me when I say neither reaction is one you're going to enjoy.\nThat's it. If worst comes to worst and you end up as a couch cushion or rolling around in a giant wheel of cheese for the next five hundred years, don't say I didn't warn you. I hope I never see you again."}

Alternatively, this quest can be acquired during the &lt;a href=\"Thieves%20Guild%20%28Morrowind%29\"&gt;Thieves Guild&lt;/a&gt; quest \"&lt;a href=\"The%20Vintage%20Brandy\"&gt;The Vintage Brandy&lt;/a&gt;\" and turned in if one is a member of House Hlaalu, even if that point in the Hlaalu questline has not been reached yet.\nWalkthrough.\nOnce the Nerevarine has returned from delivering &lt;a href=\"Orders%20for%20Bivale%20Teneran\"&gt;Teneran's orders&lt;/a&gt;, Nileno Dorvayn will give the Nerevarine the task of investigating the murder of a &lt;a href=\"House%20Hlaalu\"&gt;Hlaalu Noble&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href=\"Ralen%20Hlaalo\"&gt;Ralen Hlaalo&lt;/a&gt;, the Noble in question, was killed in his &lt;a href=\"Hlaalo%20Manor\"&gt;Manor&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Balmora%20%28Morrowind%29\"&gt;Balmora&lt;/a&gt; by an unknown assailant. The Nerevarine is tasked with finding the murderer and bringing them to justice.\nGeneral Suspicions.\nThis is an optional part of the quest and only available before the Nerevarine begins the investigation of the Hlaalo Manor. Asking around Balmora will reveal that general consensus believes that the &lt;a href=\"Argonians%20%28Morrowind%29\"&gt;Argonian&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Nine-Toes\"&gt;Nine-Toes&lt;/a&gt; was the murderer. Nine-Toes, unsurprisingly, will deny that he killed Hlaalo, and, as the Nerevarine lacks any evidence, the Nerevarine must accept this denial for the time being.\nInvestigating Hlaalo Manor.\nThe Nerevarine may enter the Manor at any time, as Dorvayn will give them a key to the Manor. Inside the Nerevarine can speak to &lt;a href=\"Uryne%20Nirith\"&gt;Uryne Nirith&lt;/a&gt;, Hlaalo's servant. She will reveal that she witnessed the murder and will proceed to give the Nerevarine a description of the assailant (&lt;a href=\"Dunmer%20%28Morrowind%29\"&gt;Dunmer&lt;/a&gt;, young, redhair, &lt;a href=\"Bonemold%20Armor%20%28Morrowind%29\"&gt;Bonemold Armor&lt;/a&gt; with a &lt;a href=\"Dwarven%20War%20Axe%20%28Morrowind%29\"&gt;Dwarven War Axe&lt;/a&gt;).\nJustice for Hlaalo.\nArmed with this description, the Nerevarine may question various people with this Nirith's description. The answer given will lead to &lt;a href=\"Thanelen%20Velas\"&gt;Thanelen Velas&lt;/a&gt; (a &lt;a href=\"Camonna%20Tong%20%28Morrowind%29\"&gt;Camonna Tong&lt;/a&gt; member) in the &lt;a href=\"Balmora%20Council%20Club\"&gt;Balmora Council Club&lt;/a&gt;. At this point the Nerevarine is faced with a choice, they can either kill Nine-Toes (if they spoke to him earlier) or Velas (as Nirith's description suggests that he did it) or, kill both suspects.\nHaving killed one, or both, of the suspects for Hlaalo's murder, the Nerevarine may return to Dorvayn. She will thank the Nerevarine for bringing justice to Hlaalo's murderer (no matter what option was chosen) and will reward them with 1,000 ."}

He owes money to his boss and needs help getting the gold together as fast as possible.\"\nWalkthrough.\n&lt;a href=\"M%27jaddha\"&gt;M'jaddha&lt;/a&gt; is in front of the &lt;a href=\"Cloudy%20Dregs%20Inn\"&gt;Cloudy Dregs Inn&lt;/a&gt; and wants you to help his brother, &lt;a href=\"S%27rashi\"&gt;S'rashi&lt;/a&gt;. S'rashi works for the &lt;a href=\"Midnight%20Union\"&gt;Midnight Union&lt;/a&gt; and runs other enterprises to aid civic order in &lt;a href=\"Wayrest%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Wayrest&lt;/a&gt;, He needs some help with uncollected debts.\nS'rashi's owes the Midnight Union money, and it is due now. S'rashi is also owed money from a gambler, a noble and a smuggler. Together, their payments will cover what he needs to pay the Midnight Union. It is unfortunate that S'rashi's own brother, M'jaddha, was not willing to do it, but if the &lt;a href=\"Vestige\"&gt;Vestige&lt;/a&gt; collects from the deadbeats, a fair percentage of the profits will be payment for the effort.\nThe gambler owes the largest sum, so the Vestige is directed to collect from him first. The Gambler, &lt;a href=\"Louis%20Ervine\"&gt;Louis Ervine&lt;/a&gt;, can be found laying on a bench beside the markets. Disturbing the resting gambler reveals that he doesn't have the money, but has won the money from &lt;a href=\"Ugurz\"&gt;Ugurz&lt;/a&gt;, who refuses to pay. Ugurz has a gang that he runs with hanging out near the docks. Ugurz is visibly opposed to making any kind of payment, but a brief conversation stating that the Vestige is collecting for S'rashi will yield immediate payment.\nThe Noble, &lt;a href=\"Padier%20Nytte\"&gt;Padier Nytte&lt;/a&gt;, is the next on the list. He can be found in the Treasury courtyard. Nytte also claims to have no money left after the last of S'rashi's investment deals, but his grandfather was buried with a valuable gem that can be had by digging it up at the Temple. There is then an intimidate option the will cause Nytte to suddenly remember that he has a valuable object with him right there.\nThe Smuggler, &lt;a href=\"Captain%20Albert%20Marck\"&gt;Captain Albert Marck&lt;/a&gt;, is already known to the Vestige, from rescuing his crew from the slavers near &lt;a href=\"Koeglin%20Village\"&gt;Koeglin Village&lt;/a&gt;. It seems he is still recovering from hard times. A trip down to the docks to meet the Captain will take you to the First Mate, &lt;a href=\"First%20Mate%20Elvira%20Derre\"&gt;Elvira Derre&lt;/a&gt;. She is the worse for drink, and will direct you back to the Inn where the Captain is. Captain Marck is also somewhat in his cups, but he is resolute about meeting S'rashi. He thinks he will be killed, but there is likely no place to hide. The Vestige then reports to S'rashi. S'rashi is sympathetic to the Captain's plight, but the debt is due, and it must be paid. There is an option to persuade S'rashi, the can pay the debt directly, or head out to a house near the markets to kill the assassin &lt;a href=\"Ramziq\"&gt;Ramziq&lt;/a&gt; who is hiding there. The price in coin or blood must be paid.\nThe very upstanding citizen, S'rashi, will then pay the Vestige his percentage and declare them a better member of the family than his brother, who called in help and hid. S'rashi declares the Vestige part of his family and promises help when needed. Given S'rashi's contributions to Wayrest, that seems like the kind of favor it is never really favorable to cash in."}

But again, where is the evidence for this? No mage or historian\u2014that I've spoken to, at least\u2014has been able to reference a specific text for this information.\nMany a historical fiction piece has attempted to dramatize what occurred there, but none of those stories can be confirmed, except to say that a catastrophic event struck the town. Perhaps the residents were killed, perhaps they fled. None were ever heard from again, but for all anyone knows, a large fire could have been the culprit. I can't imagine anything more catastrophic than that to a Wood Elf dwelling.\nToday, Gil-Var-Delle is a maligned place, and there are not many who dare to venture near. But not because of any tangible foes\u2014save cowardice and superstition."}

I write this for the benefit of all my descendants, then, who will inherit the Direfrost Flame and the Torch of Heirs in ages to come. I write this because I have seen our resolve weaken as our people expand across &lt;a href=\"Skyrim%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Skyrim&lt;/a&gt;. I write this to serve as a reminder for what the Torch and Flame truly stand for.\nTo start at the beginning, &lt;a href=\"Direfrost%20Keep\"&gt;Direfrost Keep&lt;/a&gt; has long protected our family's Flame, which allows us to contact our ancestors in &lt;a href=\"Sovngarde%20%28Location%29\"&gt;Sovngarde&lt;/a&gt;. We need only to light it with the Torch of Heirs.\nMany legends speak of the origin of these relics: that they were created by &lt;a href=\"Meridia%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Meridia&lt;/a&gt; to distress the &lt;a href=\"Daedra%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Daedra&lt;/a&gt;; or by &lt;a href=\"Shor\"&gt;Shor&lt;/a&gt; as a way for the dead god to communicate with the &lt;a href=\"Nords%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Nords&lt;/a&gt; of Nirn from Sovngarde (though no Direfrost has ever heard him through the Flame).\nThe truth has been lost to time, but the one commonality that all the legends share is that the Flame and the Torch were given to the &lt;a href=\"Direfrost%20Family\"&gt;Direfrost family&lt;/a&gt; to protect because of our absolute efficiency in battling witches and their Daedric masters. Even should the Flame go out forever, or the Torch be lost or rent in twain by &lt;a href=\"Hagraven%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Hagraven&lt;/a&gt; servants of &lt;a href=\"Oblivion%20%28Realm%29\"&gt;Oblivion&lt;/a&gt;, this fact must remain:\nThe Direfrosts must never falter in their task to halt and destroy the worshipers of Daedra wherever they may be found. So long as a Direfrost lives, witches, and all who would commune with Daedra, will have an enemy. Witch-hunting is not the profession of the Direfrosts\u2014it is our sacred calling.

The letter directs the Agent to a building within a town, in which their fellow 'tribesman' is awaiting their arrival. The letter scribe reveals that a 'local warlord' has been harassing the Clan, and that while this would ordinarily result in the death of the warlord, their influence is too significant to simply eradicate.\nA Warlord Worrier.\nThe Agent's 'tribesman' requests that the Agent simply 'rough [the warlord] up a bit' in their base, a dungeon in the &lt;a href=\"Regions%20%28Daggerfall%29\"&gt;region&lt;/a&gt;. The Agent must then journey to and delve into the aforementioned dungeon and find the warlord, whom will spawn as a knight within. The Agent will then have to deliver a series of non-fatal blows, with the successful hit resulting in one of the following responses:\n\"Sweet [random God], tell [Bloodline] that I'll do anything! Just don't kill me!\"\n\"[Oath], I surrender! I'll do anything they want, just please, in the name of [random God], don't kill me!\"\nWith that the Agent must escape the dungeon and return to their vampiric contact before the time limit expires to complete the quest successfully.\nIt must be noted, however, that it is possible to kill the warrior, thereby failing the quest. Furthermore, despite the fact that the warlord has been pacified, the randomly spawned &lt;a href=\"Creatures%20%28Daggerfall%29\"&gt;creatures&lt;/a&gt; within the dungeon will not stop attacking, meaning the Agent may have to fight their way out of the dungeon. This may lead to the Agent landing another blow on the warlord, which will cause them to become hostile to the Agent once again.\nRewards.\nThe Agent will receive a single piece of &lt;a href=\"Clothing%20%28Daggerfall%29\"&gt;jewelry&lt;/a&gt; for successfully completing the quest, as well as a minor change to their reputation with other factions. Interestingly, there will be no change in reputation with the Agent's vampiric bloodline, regardless of success or failure.\nThe changes in reputation, based on success or failure, are shown below:"}

I visited all of the lands associated with my beloved &lt;a href=\"Ebonheart%20Pact\"&gt;Ebonheart Pact&lt;/a&gt;, including &lt;a href=\"Morrowind%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Morrowind&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Black%20Marsh%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Black Marsh&lt;/a&gt;. I explored &lt;a href=\"Wrothgar\"&gt;Wrothgar&lt;/a&gt;, the land of the &lt;a href=\"Orsimer%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Orcs&lt;/a&gt;. But the place that has made my head hurt most of all is the island of the snooty &lt;a href=\"Altmer%20%28Online%29\"&gt;High Elves&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Summerset%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Summerset&lt;/a&gt;. Even &lt;a href=\"Rigurt%20the%20Brash\"&gt;Rigurt&lt;/a&gt; dislikes the smug, pointy-eared milk-drinkers, and he likes everybody! &lt;a href=\"Kyne\"&gt;Kyne&lt;/a&gt; knows I endeavor to be nice and struggle not to hit a few of them with my axe, no matter how much they test my patience.\nMy first task upon arriving in this land that smells of salt water and pretension was to gather whatever information I could concerning law and order. Even though we arrived under a banner of peace and diplomacy, we are still Nords. While I can't determine if the High Elves dislike us because of our association with the Pact or because we don't look like they do, I must make sure that the members of our delegation don't inadvertently break a rule and cause an international incident. The island has more than its share of &lt;a href=\"Guards%20%28Online%29\"&gt;guards&lt;/a&gt; and town constables, but the real power seems to lie in the oddly named &lt;a href=\"Divine%20Prosecution\"&gt;Divine Prosecution&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe Divine Prosecution consists of duly authorized agents loyal to &lt;a href=\"Queen%20Ayrenn%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Queen Ayrenn&lt;/a&gt; and her &lt;a href=\"Thalmor%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Thalmor&lt;/a&gt;, the paramilitary enforcers of the &lt;a href=\"Aldmeri%20Dominion%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Dominion&lt;/a&gt;. On Summerset, the Divine Prosecution represents law and order, responsible for enforcing both secular and religious law. They seem to be similar to the &lt;a href=\"Ordinator%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Ordinators&lt;/a&gt; of the &lt;a href=\"Tribunal%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Tribunal&lt;/a&gt;, but without all the creepy face masks and fancy armor. I was able to interview one of their number, a somber but otherwise accommodating justiciar named &lt;a href=\"Justiciar%20Rullion\"&gt;Rullion&lt;/a&gt;.\nJusticiar Rullion explained that the primary function of the Divine Prosecution was to act as investigators of crimes and minor offenses, and adjudicators of disputes and legal disagreements. I got the sense that they had a much broader mandate than he let on, serving as not only secular lawkeepers but as the protectors of religious and social mores. When I pressed, he admitted that he and his fellow justiciars were called in when situations developed beyond the skills of the local constabulary. \"We go where our investigations take us,\" he added before leaving me to my mid-day meal of rabbit meatballs and a few bottles of mead.\nAs I wandered around the city of &lt;a href=\"Alinor%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Alinor&lt;/a&gt; I noticed that Rullion seemed to be going about the business of the Divine Prosecution while remaining always in my field of vision. I watched him settle an argument between a merchant and her customer, hearing both sides before rendering a binding decision that each accepted before he moved on. Then he apprehended a pickpocket in the act of stealing a noble's purse and handed the criminal to one of the city guards. Through it all, I had the feeling that all the while he was actually keeping an eye on me. I supposed observing foreign visitors also falls under the purview of the agents of the Divine Prosecution. I didn't really mind. Besides, his constant presence would make it easier to find him at supper time.\nI wonder if Justiciar Rullion has a taste for mead?"}

You have heard of him as the author of the book '&lt;a href=\"On%20Oblivion\"&gt;On Oblivion&lt;/a&gt;,' the standard text for all on matters Daedric. Despite many entreaties over the years, he refused to update his classic book with his new discoveries and theories because he found that the more one delves into these realms, the less certain one is. He did not want conjecture, he wanted facts.\nFor decades before and after the publication of 'On Oblivion,' Zenas compiled a vast personal library on the subject of Oblivion, the home of the &lt;a href=\"Daedra\"&gt;Daedra&lt;/a&gt;. He divided his time between this research and personal magickal growth, on the assumption that should he succeed in finding a way into the dangerous world beyond and behind ours, he would need much power to wander its dark paths.\nTwelve years before Zenas began the journey he had prepared his life to make, he hired me as his assistant. I possessed the three attributes he required for the position: I was young and eager to help without question; I could read any book once and memorize its contents; and, despite my youth, I was already a Master of &lt;a href=\"Conjuration\"&gt;Conjuration&lt;/a&gt;.\nZenas too was a Master of Conjuration - indeed, a Master at all the known and unknown &lt;a href=\"Schools%20of%20Magicka\"&gt;Schools&lt;/a&gt; - but he did not want to rely on his ability alone in the most perilous of his research. In an underground vault, he summoned Daedra to interview them on their native land, and for that he needed another Conjurer to make certain they came, were bound, and were sent away again without incident.\nI will never forget that vault, not for its look which was plain and unadorned, but for what you couldn't see. There were scents that lingered long after the summoned creatures had left, flowers and sulfur, sex and decay, power and madness. They haunt me still to this very day.\nConjuration, for the layman unacquainted with its workings, connects the caster's mind with that of the summoned. It is a tenuous link, meant only to lure, hold, and dismiss, but in the hands of a Master, it can be much stronger. The &lt;a href=\"Psijics\"&gt;Psijics&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Dwemer\"&gt;Dwemer&lt;/a&gt; can (in the Dwemer's case, perhaps I should say, could) connect with the minds of others, and converse miles apart - a skill that is sometimes called telepathy.\nOver the course of my employment, Zenas and I developed such a link between one another. It was accidental, a result of two powerful Conjurers working closely together, but we decided that it would be invaluable should he succeed in traveling to Oblivion. Since the denizens of that land could be touched even by the skills of an amateur Conjurer, it was possible we could continue to communicate while he was there, so I could record his discoveries.\nThe 'Doors to Oblivion,' to use Morian Zenas's phrase, are not easily found, and we exhausted many possibilities before we found one where we held the key.\nThe Psijics of Artaeum have a place they call &lt;a href=\"The%20Dreaming%20Cave\"&gt;The Dreaming Cave&lt;/a&gt;, where it is said one can enter into the &lt;a href=\"Daedric\"&gt;Daedric&lt;/a&gt; realms and return. &lt;a href=\"Iachesis\"&gt;Iachesis&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Sotha%20Sil\"&gt;Sotha Sil&lt;/a&gt;, Nematigh, and many others have been recorded as using this means, but despite many entreaties to the Order, we were denied its use. &lt;a href=\"Loremaster%20Celarus\"&gt;Celarus&lt;/a&gt;, the leader of the Order, has told us it has been sealed off for the safety of all.\nWe had hopes of using the ruins of the &lt;a href=\"Battlespire\"&gt;Battlespire&lt;/a&gt; to access Oblivion. The &lt;a href=\"Weir%20Gate\"&gt;Weir Gate&lt;/a&gt; still stands, though the old proving grounds of the &lt;a href=\"Imperial%20Battlemage\"&gt;Imperial Battlemage&lt;/a&gt;s itself was shattered some years ago in &lt;a href=\"Jagar%20Tharn\"&gt;Jagar Tharn&lt;/a&gt;'s time. Sadly, after an exhaustive search through the detritus, we had to conclude that when it was destroyed, all access to the realms beyond, the &lt;a href=\"Soul%20Cairn\"&gt;Soul Cairn&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"Shade%20Perilous\"&gt;Shade Perilous&lt;/a&gt;, and the &lt;a href=\"Havoc%20Wellhead\"&gt;Havoc Wellhead&lt;/a&gt;, had been broken. It was probably for the good, but it frustrated our goal.\nThe reader may have heard of other Doors, and he may be assured we attempted to find them all.\nSome are pure legend, or at any rate, not traceable based on the information left behind. There are references in lore to Marukh's Abyss, the Corryngton Mirror, the &lt;a href=\"Mantellan%20Crux\"&gt;Mantellan Crux&lt;/a&gt;, the Crossroads, the Mouth, a riddle of an alchemical formula called Jacinth and Rising Sun, and many other places and objects that are said to be Doors, but we could not find.\nSome exist, but cannot be entered safely. The whirlpool in the Abecean called the &lt;a href=\"Maelstrom%20of%20Bal\"&gt;Maelstrom of Bal&lt;/a&gt; can make ships disappear, and may be a portal into Oblivion, but the trauma of riding its waters would surely slay any who tried. Likewise, we did not consider it worth the risk to leap from the &lt;a href=\"Pillar%20of%20Thras\"&gt;Pillar of Thras&lt;/a&gt;, a thousand foot tall spiral of coral, though we witnessed the sacrifices the sloads made there. Some victims were killed by the fall, but some, indeed, seemed to vanish before being dashed on the rocks. Since the &lt;a href=\"Sload\"&gt;sload&lt;/a&gt; did not seem certain why some were taken and some died, we did not favor the odds of the plunge.\nThe simplest and most maddeningly complex way to go to Oblivion was simply to cease to be here, and begin to be there. Throughout history, there are examples of mages who seemed to travel to the realms beyond ours seemingly at will. Many of these voyagers are long dead, if they ever existed, but we were able to find one still living. In a tower off &lt;a href=\"Zafirbel%20Bay\"&gt;Zafirbel Bay&lt;/a&gt; on the island of &lt;a href=\"Vvardenfell\"&gt;Vvardenfell&lt;/a&gt; in the province of Morrowind there exists a very old, very reclusive wizard named &lt;a href=\"Divayth%20Fyr\"&gt;Divayth Fyr&lt;/a&gt;.\nHe was not easy to reach, and he was reluctant to share with Morian Zenas the secret Door to Oblivion. Fortunately, my master's knowledge of lore impressed Fyr, and he taught him the way. I would be breaking my promise to Zenas and Fyr to explain the procedure here, and I would not divulge it even if I could. If there is dangerous knowledge to be had, that is it. But I do not reveal too much to say that Fyr's scheme relied on exploiting a series of portals to various realms created by a &lt;a href=\"House%20Telvanni\"&gt;Telvanni&lt;/a&gt; wizard long missing and presumed dead. Against the disadvantage of this limited number of access points, we weighed the relative reliability and security of passage, and considered ourselves fortunate in our informant.\nMorian Zenas then left this world to begin his exploration. I stayed at the library to transcribe his information and help him with any research he needed.\n'Dust,' he whispered to me on the first day of his voyage. Despite the inherent dreariness of the word, I could hear his excitement in his voice, echoing in my mind. 'I can see from one end of the world to the other in a million shades of gray. There is no sky or ground or air, only particles, floating, falling, whirling about me. I must levitate and breathe by magickal means ...'\n\"Zenas explored the nebulous land for some time, encountering vaporous creatures and palaces of smoke. Though he never met the Prince, we concluded that he was in &lt;a href=\"Ashpit\"&gt;Ashpit&lt;/a&gt;, said to be the home of &lt;a href=\"Malacath\"&gt;Malacath&lt;/a&gt;, where anguish, betrayal, and broken promises like ash filled the bitter air.\"\n'The sky is on fire,' I heard him say as he moved on to the next realm. 'The ground is sludge, but traversable. I see blackened ruins all around me, like a war was fought here in the distant past. The air is freezing. I cast blooms of warmth all around me, but it still feels like daggers of ice stabbing me in all directions.'\nThis was &lt;a href=\"Coldharbour\"&gt;Coldharbour&lt;/a&gt;, where &lt;a href=\"Molag%20Bal\"&gt;Molag Bal&lt;/a&gt; was Prince. It appeared to Zenas as if it were a future &lt;a href=\"Nirn\"&gt;Nirn&lt;/a&gt;, under the King of Rape, desolate and barren, filled with suffering. I could hear Morian Zenas weep at the images he saw, and shiver at the sight of the Imperial Palace, spattered with blood and excrement.\n'Too much beauty,' Zenas gasped when he went to the next realm. 'I am half blind. I see flowers and waterfalls, majestic trees, a city of silver, but it is all a blur. The colors run like water. It's raining now, and the wind smells like perfume. This surely is &lt;a href=\"Moonshadow%20%28Location%29\"&gt;Moonshadow&lt;/a&gt;, where &lt;a href=\"Azura\"&gt;Azura&lt;/a&gt; dwells.'\nZenas was right, and astonishingly, he even had audience with the Queen of Dusk and Dawn in her rose palace. She listened to his tale with a smile, and told him of the coming of the &lt;a href=\"Nerevarine\"&gt;Nerevarine&lt;/a&gt;. My master found Moonshadow so lovely, he wished to stay there, half-blind, forever, but he knew he must move on and complete his journey of discovery.\n'I am in a storm,' he told me as he entered the next realm. He described the landscape of dark twisted trees, howling spirits, and billowing mist, and I thought he might have entered the &lt;a href=\"Deadlands\"&gt;Deadlands&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"Mehrunes%20Dagon\"&gt;Mehrunes Dagon&lt;/a&gt;. But then he said quickly, 'No, I am no longer in a forest. There was a flash of lightning, and now I am on a ship. The mast is tattered. The crew is slaughtered. Something is coming through the waves ... oh, gods ... Wait, now, I am in a dank dungeon, in a cell ...'\nHe was not in the Deadlands, but &lt;a href=\"Quagmire\"&gt;Quagmire&lt;/a&gt;, the nightmare realm of &lt;a href=\"Vaernima\"&gt;Vaermina&lt;/a&gt;. Every few minutes, there was a flash of lightning and reality shifted, always to something more horrible and horrifying. A dark castle one moment, a den of ravening beasts the next, a moonlit swamp, a coffin where he was buried alive. Fear got the better of my master, and he quickly passed to the next realm.\nI heard him laugh, 'I feel like I'm home now.'\nMorian Zenas described to me an endless library, shelves stretching on in every direction, stacks on top of stacks. Pages floated on a mystical wind that he could not feel. Every book had a black cover with no title. He could see no one, but felt the presence of ghosts moving through the stacks, rifling through books, ever searching.\nIt was &lt;a href=\"Apocrypha\"&gt;Apocrypha&lt;/a&gt;. The home of &lt;a href=\"Hermaeus%20Mora\"&gt;Hermaeus-Mora&lt;/a&gt;, where all forbidden knowledge can be found. I felt a shudder in my mind, but I could not tell if it was my master's or mine.\nMorian Zenas never traveled to another realm that I know of.\nThroughout his visits to the first four realms, my master spoke to me constantly. Upon entering the Apocrypha, he became quieter, as he was lured into the world of research and study, the passions that had controlled his heart while on Nirn. I would frantically try to call to him, but he closed his mind to me.\nThen he would whisper, 'This cannot be ...'\n'No one would ever guess the truth ...'\n'I must learn more ...'\n'I see the world, a last illusion's shimmer, it is crumbling all around us ...'\nI would cry back to him, begging him to tell me what was happening, what he was seeing, what he was learning. I even tried using Conjuration to summon him as if he were a Daedra himself, but he refused to leave. Morian Zenas was lost.\nI last received a whisper from him six months ago. Before then, it had been five years, and three before that. His thoughts are no longer intelligible in any language. Perhaps he is still in Apocrypha, lost but happy, in a trap he refuses to escape.\nPerhaps he slipped between the stacks and passed into the Madhouse of &lt;a href=\"Sheogorath\"&gt;Sheogorath&lt;/a&gt;, losing his sanity forever.\nI would save him if I could.\nI would silence his whispers if I could."}

I even tried using Conjuration to summon him as if he were a Daedra himself, but he refused to leave. Morian Zenas was lost.\nI last received a whisper from him six months ago. Before then, it had been five years, and three before that. His thoughts are no longer intelligible in any language. Perhaps he is still in Apocrypha, lost but happy, in a trap he refuses to escape.\nPerhaps he slipped between the stacks and passed into the Madhouse of &lt;a href=\"Sheogorath\"&gt;Sheogorath&lt;/a&gt;, losing his sanity forever.\nI would save him if I could.\nI would silence his whispers if I could."}

When she reached the age of consent, he locked the gold away for safe-keeping, and announced his intention to have her marry. She was a comely lass, a scholar, a great athlete, but dour and brooding in aspect. This personality defect did not bother her potential suitors any more than her positive traits impressed them. Every man knew the tremendous wealth that would be his as the husband of Genefra and son-in-law of Ynaleigh. That alone was enough for hundreds to come to Gunal to pay court.\n\u201cThe man who will marry my daughter,\u201d said Ynaleigh to the assembled. \u201cMust not be doing so purely out of avarice. He must demonstrate his own wealth to my satisfaction.\u201d\nThis simple pronouncement removed a vast majority of the suitors, who knew they could not impress the landowner with their meager fortunes. A few dozen did come forward within a few days, clad in fine killarc cloth of spun silver, accompanied by exotic servants, traveling in magnificent carriages. Of all who came who met with Ynaleigh's approval, none arrived in a more resplendent fashion that Welyn Naerillic. The young man, who no one had ever heard of, arrived in a shining ebon coach drawn by a team of dragons, his clothing of rarest manufacture, and accompanied by an army of the most fantastical servants any of Gunal had ever seen. Valets with eyes on all sides of their heads, maidservants that seemed cast in gemstones.\nBut such was not enough with Ynaleigh.\n\u201cThe man who marries my daughter must prove himself a intelligent fellow, for I would not have an ignoramus as a son-in-law and business partner,\u201d he declared.\nThis eliminated a large part of the wealthy suitors, who, through their lives of luxury, had never needed to think very much if at all. Still some came forward over the next few days, demonstrating their wit and learning, quoting the great sages of the past and offering their philosophies of metaphysics and alchemy. Welyn Naerillic too came and asked Ynaleigh to dine at the villa he had rented outside of Gunal. There the landowner saw scores of scribes working on translations of &lt;a href=\"Aldmer\"&gt;Aldmer&lt;/a&gt;i tracts, and enjoyed the young man's somewhat irreverent but intriguing intelligence.\nNevertheless, though he was much impressed with Welyn Naerillic, Ynaleigh had another challenge.\n\u201cI love my daughter very much,\u201d said Ynaleigh. \u201cAnd I hope that the man who marries her will make her happy as well. Should any of you make her smile, she and the great dowry are yours.\u201d\nThe suitors lined up for days, singing her songs, proclaiming their devotion, describing her beauty in the most poetic of terms. Genefra merely glared at all with hatred and melancholia. Ynaleigh who stood by her side began to despair at last. His daughter's suitors were failing to a man at this task. Finally Welyn Naerillic came to the chamber.\n\u201cI will make your daughter smile,\u201d he said. \u201cI dare say, I'll make her laugh, but only after you've agreed to marry us. If she is not delighted within one hour of our engagement, the wedding can be called off.\u201d\nYnaleigh turned to his daughter. She was not smiling, but her eyes had sparked with some morbid curiosity in this young man. As no other suitor had even registered that for her, he agreed.\n\u201cThe dowry is naturally not to be paid 'til after you've wed,\u201d said Ynaleigh. \u201cBeing engaged is not enough.\u201d\n\u201cMight I see the dowry still?\u201d asked Welyn.\nKnowing how fabled the treasure was and understanding that this would likely be the closest the young man would come to possessing it, Ynaleigh agreed. He had grown quite found of Welyn. On his orders, Welyn, Ynaleigh, glum Genefra, and the castellan delved deep into the stronghold of Gunal. The first vault had to be opened by touching a series of runic symbols: should one of the marks be mispressed, a volley of poisoned arrows would have struck the thief. Ynaleigh was particularly proud of the next level of security -- a lock composed of blades with eighteen tumblers required three keys to be turned simultaneously to allow entry. The blades were designed to eviscerate any who merely picked one of the locks. Finally, they reached the storeroom.\nIt was entirely empty.\n\u201cBy &lt;a href=\"Lorkhan\"&gt;Lorkhan&lt;/a&gt;, we've been burgled!\u201d cried Ynaleigh. \u201cBut how? Who could have done this?\u201d\n\u201cA humble but, if I may say so, rather talented burglar,\u201d said Welyn. \u201cA man who has loved your daughter from afar for many years, but did not possess the glamour or the learning to impress. That is, until the gold from her dowry afforded me the opportunity.\u201d\n\u201cYou?\u201d bellowed Ynaleigh, scarcely able to believe it. Then something even more unbelievable happened.\nGenefra began to laugh. She had never even dreamed of meeting anyone like this thief. She threw herself into his arms before her father's outraged eyes. After a moment, Ynaleigh too began to laugh.\nGenefra and Welyn were married in a month's time. Though he was in fact quite poor and had little scholarship, Ynaleigh was amazed how much his wealth increased with such a son-in-law and business partner. He only made certain never to ask from whence came the excess gold.\nPublisher's Note\nThe tale of a man trying to win the hand of a maiden whose father (usually a wealthy man or a king) tests each suitor is quite common. See, for instance, the more recent \"&lt;a href=\"The%20Four%20Suitors%20of%20Benitah\"&gt;The Four Suitors of Benitah&lt;/a&gt;\" by &lt;a href=\"Jole%20Yolivess\"&gt;Jole Yolivess&lt;/a&gt;. The behavior of the characters is quite out of character for the &lt;a href=\"Dwemer\"&gt;Dwemer&lt;/a&gt;. No one today knows their marriage customs, or even if they had marriage at all.\nOne rather odd theory of the Disappearance of the Dwarves came from this and a few other tales of \"&lt;a href=\"Marobar%20Sul\"&gt;Marobar Sul&lt;/a&gt;.\" It was proposed that the Dwemer never, in fact, left. They did not depart Nirn, much less the continent of Tamriel, and they are still among us, disguised. These scholars use the story of \"&lt;a href=\"Azura%20and%20the%20Box\"&gt;Azura and the Box&lt;/a&gt;\" to suggest that the Dwemer feared &lt;a href=\"Azura\"&gt;Azura&lt;/a&gt;, a being they could neither understand nor control, and they adopted the dress and manner of &lt;a href=\"Chimer\"&gt;Chimer&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Altmer\"&gt;Altmer&lt;/a&gt; in order to hide from Azura's gaze."}

The upheavals of the reign of &lt;a href=\"Uriel%20VII\"&gt;Uriel VII&lt;/a&gt; were only the outward signs of the historical forces that would eventually lead to the fall of the &lt;a href=\"Septim%20Empire\"&gt;Septim Dynasty&lt;/a&gt;. The so called \"&lt;a href=\"Dragon%20Break\"&gt;Dragon Break&lt;/a&gt;\" was first proposed at this time, by a wide variety of cults and fringe sects across the Empire, connected only by a common obsession with the events surrounding &lt;a href=\"Tiber%20Septim\"&gt;Tiber Septim&lt;/a&gt;'s rise to power -- the \"founding myth,\" if you will, of the Septim Dynasty.\nThe basis of the Dragon Break doctrine is now known to be a rather prosaic error in the timeline printed in the otherwise authoritative \"&lt;a href=\"Encyclopedia%20Tamrielica\"&gt;Encyclopedia Tamrielica&lt;/a&gt;,\" first published in &lt;a href=\"3E%2012\"&gt;3E 12&lt;/a&gt;, during the early years of Tiber Septim's reign. At that time, the archives of &lt;a href=\"Alinor\"&gt;Alinor&lt;/a&gt; were still inaccessible to human scholars, and the extant records from the &lt;a href=\"Alessia\"&gt;Alessia&lt;/a&gt;n period were extremely fragmentary. The &lt;a href=\"Alessian%20Order\"&gt;Alessians&lt;/a&gt; had systematically burned all the libraries they could find, and their own records were largely destroyed during the &lt;a href=\"War%20of%20Righteousness\"&gt;War of Righteousness&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe &lt;a href=\"author\"&gt;author&lt;/a&gt; of the Encyclopedia Tamrielica was apparently unfamiliar with the Alessian \"year,\" which their priesthood used to record all dates. We now know this refers to the length of the long vision-trances undertaken by the High Priestess, which might last anywhere from a few weeks to several months. Based on analysis of the surviving trance scrolls, as well as murals and friezes from Alessian temples, I estimate that the Alessian Order actually lasted only about 150 years, rather than the famous \"one thousand and eight years\" given by the Encyclopedia Tamrielica. The \"mystery\" of the millennial-plus rule of the Alessians was accepted but unexplained until the spread of the &lt;a href=\"Lorkhan\"&gt;Lorkhan&lt;/a&gt; cults in the late 3rd era, when the doctrine of the Dragon Break took hold. Because this dating (and explanation) was so widely held at the time, and then repeated by historians down through today, it has come to have the force of tradition. Recall, however, that the 3rd era historians were already separated from the Alessians by a gulf of more than 2,000 years. And history was still in its infancy, relying on the few archives from those early days.\nToday, modern archaeology and paleonumerology have confirmed what my own research in Alessian dating first suggested: that the Dragon Break was invented in the late 3rd era, based on a scholarly error, fueled by obsession with eschatology and Numidiumism, and perpetuated by scholarly inertia."}

Certain scholars believe these primitive people actually worshipped &lt;a href=\"Nine%20Divines\"&gt;the divines&lt;/a&gt; as we know them, just in the form of these totem animals. They deified the hawk, wolf, snake, moth, owl, whale, bear, fox, and the dragon. Every now and then you can stumble across the broken stone totems in the farther reaches of Skyrim.\nForemost among all animals was the &lt;a href=\"Dragons%20%28Lore%29\"&gt;dragon&lt;/a&gt;. In the ancient Nordic tongue it was drah-gkon. Occasionally the term dov-rha is used, but the language or derivation of that is not known. Using either name was forbidden to all except the &lt;a href=\"Dragon%20Priests%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;dragon priests&lt;/a&gt;. Grand temples were built to honor the dragons and appease them. Many of them survive today as ancient ruins haunted by &lt;a href=\"Draugr%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;draugr&lt;/a&gt; and undead dragon priests.\nDragons, being dragons, embraced their role as god-kings over men. After all, were they not fashioned in &lt;a href=\"Akatosh\"&gt;Akatosh&lt;/a&gt;'s own image? Were they not superior in every way to the hordes of small, soft creatures that worshipped them? For dragons, power equals truth. They had the power, so therefore it must be truth. Dragons granted small amounts of power to the dragon priests in exchange for absolute obedience. In turn, the dragon priests ruled men as equals to the kings. Dragons, of course, could not be bothered with actually ruling.\nIn &lt;a href=\"Atmora\"&gt;Atmora&lt;/a&gt;, where Ysgramor and his people came from, the dragon priests demanded tribute and set down laws and codes of living that kept peace between dragons and men. In Tamriel, they were not nearly as benevolent. It's unclear if this was due to an ambitious dragon priest, or a particular dragon, or a series of weak kings. Whatever the cause, the dragon priests began to rule with an iron fist, making virtual slaves of the rest of the population.\nWhen the populace rebelled, the dragon priests retaliated. When the dragon priests could not collect the tribute or control the masses, the dragons' response was swift and brutal. So it was the &lt;a href=\"Dragon%20War\"&gt;Dragon War&lt;/a&gt; began.\nAt first, men died by the thousands. The ancient texts reveal that a few dragons took the side of men. Why they did this is not known. The priests of the &lt;a href=\"Nine%20Divines\"&gt;Nine Divines&lt;/a&gt; claim it was Akatosh himself that intervened. From these dragons men learned magics to use against dragons. The tide began to turn and dragons began to die too.\nThe war was long and bloody. The dragon priests were overthrown and dragons were slaughtered in large numbers. The surviving dragons scattered, choosing to live in remote places away from men. The &lt;a href=\"Dragon%20Cult\"&gt;dragon cult&lt;/a&gt; itself adapted and survived. They built the &lt;a href=\"Dragon%20Burial%20Mounds\"&gt;dragon mounds&lt;/a&gt;, entombing the remains of dragons that fell in the war. They believed that one day the dragons would rise again and reward the faithful."}

He is the student Kasura was speaking of; talk to him and he will tell you that Kasura has found a weapon used by the ancient Dragonguard against the dragons. He will direct you to speak with her again; she will be by the entrance. Speak with her and she will tell you that the &lt;a href=\"Grappling%20Bow\"&gt;Grappling Bow&lt;/a&gt; she found is behind the statue to the east. The ancient Dragonguard used it to reach high places, but none of her students have mastered its use. Go get it, then talk to Kasura again to begin training with it. Your objective will be to use the grappling bow to get to the roof of the traiing hall and light the brazier there. The first point you can grapple onto is on the roof to your left; point your cursor at the pole and you will get a prompt to use the grappling bow. Use the grapple points to navigate your way to the brazier and light it, then head back down and talk to Sai Sahan.\nSai has deciphered one of the maps you and Kasura gave him; &lt;a href=\"Wind%20Scour%20Temple\"&gt;Wind Scour Temple&lt;/a&gt; is located in the &lt;a href=\"Alik%27r%20Desert%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Alik'r&lt;/a&gt;, near &lt;a href=\"HoonDing%27s%20Watch\"&gt;HoonDing's Watch&lt;/a&gt;. You can take a horse from here to the &lt;a href=\"HoonDing%27s%20Watch%20Wayshrine\"&gt;HoonDing's Watch Wayshrine&lt;/a&gt;; from there, head to the southeast. You will run into many hostile &lt;a href=\"Nedic\"&gt;Nedic&lt;/a&gt; ghosts around the ruins, so take care. Once you reach the trap door to Wind Scour Temple, head inside and Sai will appear behind you. Head through the passageway and to the big room, then speak with Sai Sahan there. He will suspect that the way to reach the archives here has something to do with the statues to the four ancient Blades grandmasters here. If you read the plaques, you will find that &lt;a href=\"Ghelin-Brol\"&gt;Ghelin-Brol&lt;/a&gt; was the first Dragonguard grandmaster, &lt;a href=\"Vashu-Pir\"&gt;Vashu-Pir&lt;/a&gt; the second, &lt;a href=\"Jaiv-yora\"&gt;Jaiv-yora&lt;/a&gt; the third and &lt;a href=\"Ettiene%20Volusus\"&gt;Ettiene Volusus&lt;/a&gt; the fourth. Light the braziers next to their statues in that order and a grapple point will appear on the platform above, allowing you to reach the higher floor and search the archives. \n&lt;a href=\"Searching%20for%20the%20Horn%20of%20Ja%27darri%2C%20Part%201\"&gt;The book&lt;/a&gt; you are looking for is in the north, in the bookcase on the left. It will describe something called the &lt;a href=\"Horn%20of%20Ja%27darri\"&gt;Horn of Ja'darri&lt;/a&gt;, which was a very powerful Dragonguard relic. The author was looking for said horn here, but did not find it and decided to instead search &lt;a href=\"Storm%20Talon%20Temple\"&gt;Storm Talon Temple&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Stormhaven%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Stormhaven&lt;/a&gt;. Take this information back to Sai and he will tell you that the map Kasura found details the location of said temple. It is in &lt;a href=\"Aphren%27s%20Hold\"&gt;Aphren's Hold&lt;/a&gt;; you can either head with Sai to &lt;a href=\"Dro-Dara%20Plantation%20Wayshrine\"&gt;Dro-Dara Plantation Wayshrine&lt;/a&gt; or you can head there yourself. Either way, you will find a trap door in the eastern tower leading to the temple. Speak with Sai once you are inside and he will remark that because the sanctuary has fallen into disrepair, it will be difficult to navigate. You can use your grappling bow to make your way through though. The ruins can be tricky to navigate, but there are no consequences for taking a wrong turn, so just proceed until you reach the archives. The answer you are looking for will be in the lone bookcase in the south room. &lt;a href=\"Searching%20for%20the%20Horn%20of%20Ja%27darri%2C%20Part%202\"&gt;The book&lt;/a&gt; there will mention that the Horn of Ja'darri is in &lt;a href=\"Dark%20Water%20Temple\"&gt;Dark Water Temple&lt;/a&gt;, just south of &lt;a href=\"Windhelm%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Windhelm&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Eastmarch%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Eastmarch&lt;/a&gt;. Head back to Sai and give him this information; you can then either travel with him or head for Eastmarch by yourself.\nEither way, your destination will be near &lt;a href=\"Icehammer%27s%20Vault\"&gt;Icehammer's Vault&lt;/a&gt;. You will find the trap door just north of the entrance of said vault; head in and start looking for Sai Sahan there. You will need to head through the passageway to the big room; there is a gap in the hallway that you will need your grappling bow to cross. In the central room, you will find Sai along with some shelves of archives. To progress, you should search the easternmost shelf; there, you will find &lt;a href=\"Letter%20to%20Marillan\"&gt;a note&lt;/a&gt; containing a riddle to cross the chasm here in this room.\n\"Take the dust of our fallen foe and offer it to the altar. As you walk the path of the Dragonguard, may your steps never falter.\"\nOnce you find this, Sai will notice a grapple point with an urn beside it. Head up there and search the urn; you will find Dragonbone Powder in there. Use said powder on the Altar and a path will appear across the chasm. If you fall off, do not worry; you can simply head back to the start and use the powder again. You will find another archive on the other side; &lt;a href=\"Searching%20for%20the%20Horn%20of%20Ja%27darri%2C%20Part%203\"&gt;the book&lt;/a&gt; you are looking for will be in the rightmost bookshelf. It will mention that the Horn was stolen from here by a dragon named &lt;a href=\"Vahlokzin\"&gt;Vahlokzin&lt;/a&gt;, whose &lt;a href=\"Vahlokzin%27s%20Lair\"&gt;lair&lt;/a&gt; is located in &lt;a href=\"Southern%20Elsweyr\"&gt;Southern Elsweyr&lt;/a&gt;. Bring this information to Sai and he will take you back to the Valley of Blades to plan your next move. Speak with Kasura there and inform her of what's been happening, then speak with Sai Sahan to finish the quest and start the next one, \"&lt;a href=\"The%20Horn%20of%20Ja%27darri\"&gt;The Horn of Ja'darri&lt;/a&gt;.\""}

Very nervous this Breton. As Jobasha said, the Breton sells Jobasha the &lt;a href=\"Minutes%20of%20the%20Lusty%20Argonian%20Historical%20Society\"&gt;minutes to a historical society&lt;/a&gt;. But this Breton also sells much fiction. Most of it very sadly autobiographical. Maybe this one is a good example.\n\"It was late last night that the dreadful theft occurred,\" Foroch said. \"They took it all. Every drop of it.\"\nThat's how he greeted me. I said nothing at first. Foroch's brewery was high in the trees, and I had just climbed the Great Spiral all the way around from the dirt below. \"I just. Stopped. To say. Goodbye. Because.\"\n\"I know it. You're off to &lt;a href=\"Cyrodiil\"&gt;Cyrodiil&lt;/a&gt; to get your education. You just dropped in for a bit of ale before leaving, is that it? Well, they took every drop of it, so there's no use begging a mug from me.\"\nI didn't contradict him. I was still panting, and he was right. I came to see him for one last taste of his fine summer ale.\n\"But if you want to take a keg to that fancy studium of yours, I might have a deal for you.\"\n\"Didn't you say it was stolen?\" I asked.\n\"I did say that, because it was stolen,\" said Foroch. \"But if you can get it back, I'll let you take a keg of it. They didn't take my regular ale. They took the Sun's Dusk ale.\"\n\"I don't believe I've ever had the pleasure of that one,\" I said.\n\"Few have, for the brewing of it is a trying task. It takes years for all the meat and bugs to fall in. And--\"\n\"Bugs?\" I asked.\n\"You can't just go dumping them in, you know,\" Foroch said, \"they have to fall naturally. Crosswings have a fierce bitterness when they die afraid. First, you must stretch seventeen strings of Alfiq-gut over each barrel. Then you must press fresh boar meat onto the strings, being careful not to let any fall before it has properly rotted. Then you must dust the meat with the finely chopped skins of the red-striped frog to make sure the crosswings are drunk and happy when they fall. You do this every month for three or more years, until you have enough meat and bugs to fill the barrel. And that's not even counting the enchantments. You have spells to attract the crosswings and mimics. And spells to keep out the flipbacks, tree-hoppers, and hoarvor young. There are spells to encourage the green mold and prevent the brown and white molds. Then you have to seal the barrel for nine or more years until the last of the green mold turns--\"\n\"It sounds very difficult,\" I said, preferring ignorance when it came to Green Pact brewing. \"Do you know who took it?\"\n\"It was those filthy, miserable &lt;a href=\"Imga\"&gt;Imga&lt;/a&gt;,\" spat Foroch. \"Six kegs I had. They're the only ones who could carry a keg over each shoulder. And the brewery stinks of them.\"\nI knew which Imga he was talking about. Boff's band. \"Aren't they in their clearing? Why don't you round up a few &lt;a href=\"mer\"&gt;mer&lt;/a&gt; and take it back?\"\n\"I can see you've no proper understanding of the matter. I can't talk with them. I'm the proper owner, so seeing them would acknowledge the theft. You Bretons are half elven, or so they say. Imga will listen to you.\"\n\"Why me? I've lived here a few years, but I'll always be an outsider,\" I said.\n\"Perfect.\"\n\"I only know what you just told me,\" I said.\n\"Perfect.\"\n\"And as you just pointed out, I don't fully understand the situation,\" I said, desperately.\n\"Perfect.\"\nThat's how I got the job.\nI walked the Great Spiral all the way back down and set out towards the Imga's clearing. As a Breton living in &lt;a href=\"Valenwood\"&gt;Valenwood&lt;/a&gt;, I often saw things from an unusual perspective. Namely, the forest floor. The &lt;a href=\"Bosmer\"&gt;Bosmer&lt;/a&gt; around &lt;a href=\"Greenheart\"&gt;Greenheart&lt;/a&gt; rarely went all the way to the ground, unless they planned on leaving the city. This had a few unfortunate consequences, I thought, when I tripped over a deer antler jutting out above the other garbage. Since the Bosmer rarely visited the ground, they had no qualms about throwing their trash down from the treetops and forgetting about it.\nI knew I was getting close to the Imga's clearing when I heard the drumming. This was a bad sign. They usually only got out the drums when they'd been drinking. I hoped they still had some of Foroch's ale left.\nWhen I got in sight of the clearing, I waited patiently for the end of their impromptu concert. I'd never be an admirer, but there was something to be said for their music. What the Imga lacked in rhythm, they made up for in enthusiasm. Pickler saw me first and stopped beating the hollow log he'd almost mashed down to pulp. \"What is that terrible smell?\"\n\"I do believe it's a man, Pickler,\" said Boff.\n\"Indeed. It has that spoiled milk odor,\" said Noggin, the last member of Boff's clan.\n\"Boff,\" I said. \"It's been a long time.\"\n\"Duke Boff to you, nemer,\" he said, as he adjusted his cloak and pulled himself up to this full height.\n\"Of course, Duke Boff,\" I said quickly. \"Forgive me. The long journey has left me without any graces.\"\n\"You're lucky I'm in such a forgiving mood today,\" said the Duke. \"What brings you to my lands?\"\n\"My Lord, I heard that you acquired some of Foroch's ale.\"\n\"Oh?\" Boff asked. \"Do you want it? I might be looking for a buyer.\"\n\"I take it there's still some left, then?\" Perhaps this journey wasn't wasted after all.\n\"Yes,\" said Duke Boff, slowly. \"We haven't finished it yet.\"\n\"Why don't we give him a taste?\" Pickler asked, with a grin.\n\"That sounds like a fine idea, Pickler. Fetch one of the kegs.\"\nI watched as Pickler lumbered off into the forest, but he passed out of sight before I could see where the kegs were hidden. He returned carrying a keg so effortlessly that I flinched when he slammed it on the ground. Obviously, the keg was still nearly full. He produced a wooden bowl and worked the tap just enough for a few swallows of ale, crinkling his wide nose as he poured.\nI took the bowl and sniffed it. I've heard that some connoisseurs judge ales and wines by their aroma, but with Bosmer drinks, this is simply a wise precaution. The &lt;a href=\"Sun%27s%20Dusk%20Ale\"&gt;Sun's Dusk Ale&lt;/a&gt; smelled nothing like Foroch's summer ale. Nor did it resemble the less palatable Bosmer drinks, such as &lt;a href=\"Jagga\"&gt;Jagga&lt;/a&gt;, which has a truly unique odor. It smelled, if anything, like a juicy steak marinated with plum wine and coriander. I took a sip and gently closed my eyes. It was dreams of flying. It was the breathless moment of my first kiss. It was a gentle fire that brought a deep smile to my face. It was happiness, distilled.\nWhen I recovered my senses I said, \"Frostfire! What is this?\"\n\"That's what I said,\" said Pickler.\n\"No, Pickler, you said, 'By the rotted and flaking third claw of &lt;a href=\"Herma-Mora\"&gt;Herma Mora&lt;/a&gt;, what is this putrid filth?'\"\nPutrid filth? I couldn't believe my ears. This ale was surely a gift from the gods!\n\"As bad as it is,\" said Noggin, \"I can't see why Foroch won't let us have a taste.\"\n\"He did it just to spite us, Noggin,\" said Duke Boff. \"He never gives us the respect we deserve. He always has some excuse to ignore the old deal.\"\n\"What does this taste like to you?\" I asked.\n\"Bitter,\" said Boff.\n\"Rotten,\" said Pickler.\n\"It's like that stuff that comes out when you squash a crosswing between your fingers,\" said Noggin.\n\"Indeed,\" said Boff. \"I hope the winds pick up tonight and carry the stench away from my lands.\"\n\"Hm,\" I said. \"Boff? Would you return the ale if Foroch says you're allowed to have some?\"\n\"Duke Boff to you,\" said the Duke automatically. \"I wouldn't want my subjects in Greenheart to think that I am a harsh ruler. If Foroch says we can have some of the ale, he can have all the kegs back.\"\n\"It's the principle of the thing,\" said Noggin.\n\"Duke Boff,\" I asked, \"can you have these back at Foroch's by midnight?\"\n\"Sure, we can do that,\" said the Duke. \"And then we can listen to Foroch say we can have the Sun's Dusk Ale anytime we want.\"\n\"It's a deal,\" I said. \"I need to hurry back to Foroch. I fear he may take some convincing.\"\nForoch was waiting for me at the entrance of the brewery. His crossed arms and scowl didn't bode well. \"I see you're back,\" he said, \"and without my Sun's Dusk ale. Well, I'm not giving you any of the summer ale. Not when--\"\n\"The Imga,\" I panted.\n\"I send you out on a simple job--\"\n\"Should be.\"\n\"And you dare to come here--\"\n\"Bringing it back.\"\n\"Empty handed--\"\n\"By midnight.\"\n\"Without even an apology! No, the first words out of your mouth were... Did you say the Imga are bringing it tonight?\"\n\"Yes,\" I said.\n\"How much is left?\" asked Foroch.\n\"Almost all of it, I believe. I think they only tapped one of the kegs.\"\n\"Excellent,\" said Foroch, getting out a couple of mugs. \"This calls for a celebration.\"\n\"Wait,\" I said. \"Wait. Please. I need to explain the terms.\"\n\"Terms? Your words fill me with dread,\" said Foroch as he swiftly put the mugs away. \"What did you promise the filthy Imga?\"\n\"That you would let them have as much of the Sun's Dusk as they wanted, once they--\"\n\"Wha... You... Why... If I... How could...\" For once, Foroch was speechless.\n\"Wait,\" I said. \"Let me explain.\"\nI had no chance to explain until nearly midnight. Foroch, who soon regained the gift of speech, ranted and raved about me, the Imga, and our common ancestors until he nearly lost his voice. When Foroch finally wound down, I tried to explain again. \"The Imga won't ask for much ale,\" I said.\n\"Won't! Won't! Have you never drunk with an Imga? Their thirst is legendary. The &lt;a href=\"Abecean%20Sea\"&gt;Abecean Sea&lt;/a&gt; wouldn't sate them.\"\n\"They don't like the ale,\" I said.\n\"Insult to injury! Now they criticize my ale after stealing it.\"\n\"Listen,\" I said. \"They won't drink much of the ale because they hate the stuff. That's why they didn't tap any of the other kegs.\"\n\"Maybe there is some sense in your plan after all,\" Foroch rasped. \"But, still, to give the Sun's Dusk to the Imga...\"\n\"You'll have to if you want any of it back,\" I said. \"If you think it's bad for them to steal it, imagine them dumping the barrels in the river while they pinch their noses.\"\n\"There are precedent and principles, you see. We've lived together since the days of &lt;a href=\"Aldmeris\"&gt;Aldmeris&lt;/a&gt;. And now, having lost our empire, our honor, our rights and dignities, now a man asks me to break traditions older than the arrival of men. To break traditions the filthy Imga half remember and rarely obeyed. There are times, Rascien, when I must say that I hate you men nearly as much as I hate the Imga and the &lt;a href=\"Khajiit\"&gt;Khajiit&lt;/a&gt;.\"\nI was shocked. Not at the sentiment, for it was common in Valenwood, but that it was spoken so plainly. \"In all the years I've lived here,\" I said, \"I've never heard--\"\n\"I said it, and I meant it,\" said Foroch, staring into his mug. \"And we'll not speak of it again.\"\nOur silence was broken by the arrival of the Imga and the ale.\nForoch stood unsteadily. \"So you've brought me a gift, have you?\"\n\"No gift, Foroch,\" said Boff. \"This is the ale we rightfully stole and--\"\n\"Rightfully?! Rightfully?!\" spat Foroch.\nThe Imga interrupted Foroch's fast-approaching rant by slamming the kegs on the floor, shaking the entire brewery and knocking a few mugs off the shelves.\nBoff placed his elbows on a keg and leaned forward. \"I want to hear it, Foroch. I want to hear the whole formal thing.\"\n\"Not on your life,\" said Foroch, backing away. \"You ask too much, Boff.\"\n\"Duke Boff to you, Bosmer.\" Boff's mouth hung open, as if he was surprised by his own words.\nForoch went speechless again. He grinded his teeth together and glared at me. I whispered, \"Think of the ale, Foroch. Think of the ale.\"\n\"I, Foroch,\" he spat, \"acknowledge that you fil... you lyi... chea... mis... That you, Duke Boff, R-Rightfully stole these barrels and that...\"\n\"And from now on we can have as much of this ale as we want, having rightfully stolen it.\"\n\"And from now on,\" said Foroch through clenched teeth. \"You may have. As much. Ale. As you want.\"\nBoff held out his hand. Foroch stared at it a full minute before shaking it hastily.\n\"How about a mug all around to close the deal?\" I asked. I couldn't resist.\n\"Maybe just a swallow,\" said Boff. I could almost see him turning green beneath his fur.\nForoch scowled the whole time he poured. Boff scowled the whole time he drank. And me? I sipped the best brew in all &lt;a href=\"Tamriel\"&gt;Tamriel&lt;/a&gt; and smiled.\nMy smile didn't fade until halfway to &lt;a href=\"Silvenar%20%28City%29\"&gt;Silvenar&lt;/a&gt; when I discovered that the keg Foroch gave me was the tapped one and already half empty."}

This letter demands that the Agent meet with another member of their Clan immediately, simply giving a town, building and name. With that, the Agent must head to the town specified and speak with their blood-kin.\nThe Cowardly Clan?\nThe bloodline vampire whom contacted the Agent reveals that the Bloodfather of the Clan has received a letter, 'found wrapped around a knife in his sanctuary'. The bloodline vampire outlines its content, stating that the Agent must meet with the author of the letter and prove that their bloodline 'are no cluster of mollycoddles'. With that, the Agent is handed a copy of the &lt;a href=\"Letter%20to%20the%20Bloodfather\"&gt;Letter to the Bloodfather&lt;/a&gt;, and the name and location of &lt;a href=\"Dungeons%20%28Daggerfall%29\"&gt;dungeon&lt;/a&gt; specified in said letter.\nReading the letter reveals more information about the challenge, most notably that the origin of the call comes from a member of one of the Covens of the &lt;a href=\"Daedric%20Princes%20%28Daggerfall%29\"&gt;Daedric Princes&lt;/a&gt;. The letter states that the Coven which to challenge the Clan over their 'monopoly on the terror business in [the &lt;a href=\"Regions%20%28Daggerfall%29\"&gt;region&lt;/a&gt;]', and that the Clan must prove their worth. The Bloodfather must therefore 'consider the gauntlet dropped', hence why the Agent is sent to 'investigate' the matter urgently.\nA Coven's Challenge.\nThe Agent must delve into the dungeon specified by both the bloodline vampire and the letter to the Bloodfather. Inside, lurking among the usual &lt;a href=\"Creatures%20%28Daggerfall%29\"&gt;dungeon creatures&lt;/a&gt;, will be an daedric apostle, whom appears as an aspect of their Prince. The Agent must speak with the aspect, whom will respond:\nThe Agent is therefore given a choice of whether to submit to the Daedric Prince, answering 'yes', or take up the Prince's challenge, answering 'no'.\nDaedric Destroyer.\nAnswering 'no' to the Prince's statement will result in the apostle responding thus:\nWith that, the apostle vanishes and is replaced by a &lt;a href=\"Daedroth%20%28Daggerfall%29\"&gt;daedroth&lt;/a&gt;, which the Agent must slay. Upon its death the Agent will receive a mental message from the Daedric Prince, whom accepts that the Clan are 'worthy of respect' and that they 'will meet [the Agent] again'. From there, the Agent simply has to return to the bloodline vampire whom originally summoned them before the time limit expires to complete the quest.\nA Coward's Call.\nIn contrast, answering yes to the apostle's welcoming statement will result in the following response:\nThat effectively ensures that the Agent fails the quest, although they still have to return to the bloodline vampire whom originally contacted them before the time limit expires.\nRewards.\nSuccessfully answering the challenge and slaying the daedroth will see the Agent rewarded with a random &lt;a href=\"Items%20%28Daggerfall%29\"&gt;gem&lt;/a&gt;, handed over by the bloodline vampire who gave them the quest. Furthermore, the Agent will receive a significant boost in their reputation, not just with the Clan, but with the Prince whom they defied and the &lt;a href=\"Dark%20Brotherhood%20%28Daggerfall%29\"&gt;Dark Brotherhood&lt;/a&gt;. Conversely, submitting to the Prince will result in the Agent losing a significant amount of reputation with Clan, Prince and Brotherhood.\nThe changes in reputation, based on success or failure, are shown below:\nSuccessfully rebelling against the Daedric Prince and slaughtering their aspect will result in the additional reputation changes outlined below:\nConversely, failing the quest by submitting to the Daedric Prince will result in following loss in reputation:"}

He suspects it to be \"Hajeckius\", \"Hajesheeus\" or \"Haj-Ei\".\nWith this information, the Nerevarine has multiple possibilities on how to proceed. He could return to Daric Bielle and tell him that his guide Hides His Eyes is Haj-Ei, the very slave he was looking for.

He will tell you that he is looking for someone called Nikolvara, so that he can take her flute that she uses to control &lt;a href=\"Durzog%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Durzogs&lt;/a&gt;. He hopes to use these Durzogs to make a fortune in Orsinium, selling the beasts to the Orcs. \nNikolvara has made her home in Nikolvara's Kennel, nearby. You will find the flute in a backpack in the west of the dungeon, south of the creek. Once you have it, test it on one of the durzogs found north of the bridge. You will find that it does not work. After this, head out of the dungeon and bring the flute to Fedar. He will be on the northern outskirts of Orsinium, northwest of &lt;a href=\"Skalar%27s%20Hostel\"&gt;Skalar's Hostel&lt;/a&gt;. You can either lie to him and tell him that the flute is magical, or you can tell him the truth and tell him that Nikolvara trained the durzogs through skill. Either way, the quest ends here. "}
