An elevated walkway runs along the western and northern parts of the camp. There are mammoth bones and firewood scattered around as well as a &lt;a href=\"woodchopping%20block\"&gt;woodchopping block&lt;/a&gt;, complete with &lt;a href=\"woodcutter%27s%20axe\"&gt;woodcutter's axe&lt;/a&gt;s.

There is a wooden pole shed in the center of the camp with a table and a &lt;a href=\"tanning%20rack\"&gt;tanning rack&lt;/a&gt;. A &lt;a href=\"grindstone\"&gt;grindstone&lt;/a&gt; is at the north end of the walkway, above the entrance of the mine.\nHalted Stream Camp mine.\nThe camp is built next to the cliff wall with an entrance into a mine. The mine has many &lt;a href=\"Iron%20Ore%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;iron ore&lt;/a&gt; veins (and &lt;a href=\"Pickaxe%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;pickaxes&lt;/a&gt; to mine them with), and is the main living quarters of the bandits. It can be entered either through the entrance or by finding the spike pit outside and carefully falling down into it.\nEntering through the main entrance, there is a trap on the ground that drops boulders. Several types of fungi can be collected in this area. There is a novice-locked gate and a bandit outlaw, who is carrying the key. If entering the mine through the spike pit, there is another key on a table next to the &lt;a href=\"forge\"&gt;forge&lt;/a&gt;.\nIn the main room there are two bandits and a bandit chief. There are also bear traps on the ground, several fire lamps above, and a swinging trap by the spike pit. Shooting down the fire lamps, or using flame spells on the oil pool, can be helpful when clearing out the mine at lower levels. This main chamber has a forge, &lt;a href=\"grindstone\"&gt;grindstone&lt;/a&gt;, and tanning rack. Various potions are on the tables and bookshelf, with a chest next to the bed. There is also a hidden, novice-locked chest under the main stairs through a wooden hallway.\nSpike pit.\nThe exit at the back of the mine leads to a pit trap the bandits have been using to kill mammoths. There are spikes in the bottom that may wound or kill anyone trying to use the pit as an entrance. A dead &lt;a href=\"Altmer%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Altmer&lt;/a&gt; lies in the middle of the spikes, alongside several animals in the trapped pit.\nMining.\nHalted Stream Camp is a good place for mining iron. There are sixteen iron ore veins and one &lt;a href=\"corundum%20ore\"&gt;corundum ore&lt;/a&gt; vein to be mined. There are at least three pickaxes in the first part of the mine.\nIron ore vein locations.\nThese are the locations of the iron ore deposits in the mineshaft:\nTrivia.\nBandit 1 \"Gotta have a sharp axe to cut through all that fat...\"\"\nBandit 2 \"Hurry up with it. We've got a merchant in the pit to take care of after we carve this thing up.\"\""}

I saw so many strange and wonderful things out there - pine trees as tall as mountains, old Nord tombs, I once even stumbled across a wandering spirit made of pure ice!\nEven ran across a few folks trying their hand at taming different types of creatures. Don't know why they'd want anything but a loyal dog or trusty goat like my Hilda though - some of them beasts out in the wild just aren't meant to be tamed.\nRan across an alchemist with a &lt;a href=\"Thistle\"&gt;pet rabbit&lt;/a&gt;, and almost got robbed by a thief with a &lt;a href=\"Sweet%20Roll%20%28Skyrim%20Creation%20Club%20Creature%29\"&gt;tamed fox&lt;/a&gt;, but I suppose a rabbit or fox could be docile enough.

In the past, Hamelyn was an apprentice alchemist in the &lt;a href=\"College%20of%20Winterhold%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;College of Winterhold&lt;/a&gt;, but his \"irresponsibility\" caused him to be kicked out of the institution, and he was even arrested in Whiterun due to his obsessive and dangerous experiments involving skeevers. Such experiments likely resulted in the &lt;a href=\"Venomfang%20Skeever\"&gt;Venomfang Skeever&lt;/a&gt;s found in his lair, and his background can be read in &lt;a href=\"Hamelyn%27s%20Journal\"&gt;his journal&lt;/a&gt;, which can be looted off his body during the &lt;a href=\"Thieves%20Guild%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Thieves Guild&lt;/a&gt; quest \"&lt;a href=\"Dampened%20Spirits\"&gt;Dampened Spirits&lt;/a&gt;.\"\nInteractions.\n&lt;a href=\"Dampened%20Spirits\"&gt;Dampened Spirits&lt;/a&gt;.\nAfter completing the quest \"&lt;a href=\"Loud%20and%20Clear\"&gt;Loud and Clear&lt;/a&gt;,\" &lt;a href=\"Brynjolf%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Brynjolf&lt;/a&gt; will say that &lt;a href=\"Maven%20Black-Briar\"&gt;Maven Black-Briar&lt;/a&gt; wishes to speak to the &lt;a href=\"Last%20Dragonborn\"&gt;Dragonborn&lt;/a&gt;.

Their ignorance of impending annihilation amuses me. I will bury Whiterun and watch Winterhold burn. And when they experience the fury I've unleashed upon them, when my progeny are gnawing the flesh from their bones, they will come begging and groveling at my feet. But there will be no mercy, no quarter and no leniency. And I will laugh and I will dance and I will rejoice over their mangled, broken corpses. The time for recompense has arrived.\nTen years of pain. Ten years of misery. Ten years of death."}

It is the homeland of the &lt;a href=\"Redguards\"&gt;Redguards&lt;/a&gt;, and has been traditionally ruled by a High King or Queen, such as &lt;a href=\"Thassad%20II\"&gt;Thassad II&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"Iszara\"&gt;Iszara&lt;/a&gt;. Once a province of the &lt;a href=\"Third%20Empire\"&gt;Empire&lt;/a&gt;\u00a0of Tamriel until the\u00a0&lt;a href=\"Great%20War\"&gt;Great War&lt;/a&gt;, Hammerfell became a sovereign nation in &lt;a href=\"4E%20175\"&gt;4E 175&lt;/a&gt; after its rejection of the &lt;a href=\"White-Gold%20Concordat\"&gt;White-Gold Concordat&lt;/a&gt;.\nHammerfell is a massive region, covered by vast jungles, wooded mountain ranges, subtropical grasslands, humid swamps, and arid deserts. The desolate\u00a0&lt;a href=\"Alik%27r%20Desert\"&gt;Alik'r Desert&lt;/a&gt;\u00a0is one of Hammerfell's most well-known regions, taking up the northwest corner of the province. There are various rivers in Hammerfell, including the &lt;a href=\"Irk%20River\"&gt;Irk&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Nilata%20River\"&gt;Nilata&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Tark%20River\"&gt;Tark&lt;/a&gt;, which are characterized by &lt;a href=\"Ginkgo\"&gt;Ginkgo&lt;/a&gt; trees.\nThe province is especially notable for being the home of the\u00a0Redguards, a race of men known for being cunning warriors and skilled swordsmen. Though many skirmishes followed the invasion of &lt;a href=\"Yokuda\"&gt;Yokuda&lt;/a&gt;, the land stayed under the ownership of the Redguards. Before the Redguards, however, the &lt;a href=\"Dwemer\"&gt;Dwemer&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Nedes\"&gt;Nedes&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Keptu\"&gt;Keptu&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Goblin\"&gt;Giant Goblins&lt;/a&gt; once occupied Hammerfell, and the &lt;a href=\"Orsimer\"&gt;Orsimer&lt;/a&gt; have lived there since the &lt;a href=\"Merethic%20Era\"&gt;Merethic Era&lt;/a&gt;.\nPeople.\nThe Redguards.\nThe Redguards are a race of humans who hail from the lost continent of &lt;a href=\"Yokuda\"&gt;Yokuda&lt;/a&gt; and now call Hammerfell their home. Due to their swift and decisive conquest of Hammerfell, the Redguards are renowned as some of the most naturally gifted &lt;a href=\"Warrior%20%28Class%29\"&gt;warriors&lt;/a&gt; in Tamriel. Their ferocity and versatility is also manifested in their personality, which lends itself to why they are most effective as &lt;a href=\"scout\"&gt;scout&lt;/a&gt;s and in small units as opposed to being deployed as rank and file soldiers.\nThe Redguards' innate agility and high level of endurance allows them to excel in any activity that demands sustained effort. Most notably in &lt;a href=\"combat\"&gt;combat&lt;/a&gt;. They are largely average in height, with a well muscled and sturdy physique. Also, they are blessed with a very hardy constitution that allows them to resist &lt;a href=\"poison\"&gt;poison&lt;/a&gt;. In appearance, the Redguards' skin tone can range from light brown to black and their hair texture ranges from thick and wavy to tightly curled and wiry.\nHistory.\nFirst Era.\nThe history of Hammerfell began long before the arrival of the Redguards upon its shores. The land between the &lt;a href=\"Iliac%20Bay\"&gt;Iliac Bay&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Gold%20Coast\"&gt;Gold Coast&lt;/a&gt; of Cyrodiil was called Hegathe, roughly meaning \"Death Lands,\" in the tongue of the &lt;a href=\"Aldmer\"&gt;Aldmer&lt;/a&gt; peoples. The &lt;a href=\"Ayleid\"&gt;Ayleid&lt;/a&gt; elves set up coastal settlements in the southern portion of what is now Hammerfell, though none survived into the &lt;a href=\"Third%20Era\"&gt;Third Era&lt;/a&gt;. The northern Elves and their &lt;a href=\"Breton\"&gt;Breton&lt;/a&gt; descendants also set up coastal settlements, which became, after the Ra Gada conquest, the cities of &lt;a href=\"Sentinel\"&gt;Sentinel&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Lainlyn\"&gt;Lainlyn&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Dwemer\"&gt;Dwemer&lt;/a&gt; became the first to fully settle Hammerfell in the year &lt;a href=\"1E%20420\"&gt;1E 420&lt;/a&gt;. The &lt;a href=\"Rourken%20Clan\"&gt;Rourken Clan&lt;/a&gt; of Dwemer left their &lt;a href=\"Morrowind\"&gt;Morrowind&lt;/a&gt; brethren after the formation of the &lt;a href=\"First%20Council\"&gt;First Council&lt;/a&gt; alliance between the Dwemer and the &lt;a href=\"Chimer\"&gt;Chimer&lt;/a&gt;. Legend has it that the leader of the Rourken threw his hammer, &lt;a href=\"Volendrung\"&gt;Volendrung&lt;/a&gt;, and built &lt;a href=\"Volenfell\"&gt;Volenfell&lt;/a&gt;, the capital of the Western Dwemer, where it landed. Other famous Dwemer cities include the citadel on the island of &lt;a href=\"Stros%20M%27kai\"&gt;Stros M'kai&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Fang%20Lair\"&gt;Fang Lair&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;a href=\"Dragontail%20Mountains\"&gt;Dragontail Mountains&lt;/a&gt;. After the &lt;a href=\"Battle%20of%20Red%20Mountain\"&gt;Battle of Red Mountain&lt;/a&gt; and the disappearance of the Dwemer in the year &lt;a href=\"1E%20700\"&gt;1E 700&lt;/a&gt;, their fantastical cities were lost to looters, professional expedition groups, the &lt;a href=\"Falmer\"&gt;Falmer&lt;/a&gt;,\u00a0and the elements of nature. Savage beasts that had once been kept at bay by the Dwemer returned to Hammerfell following their disappearance.\nThe arrival of the Ra Gada (Warrior Wave) in the year &lt;a href=\"1E%20808\"&gt;1E 808&lt;/a&gt; marked the beginning of a modern era for Hammerfell.\nLeaving their homeland of &lt;a href=\"Yokuda\"&gt;Yokuda&lt;/a&gt; following its decimation in the early eight hundreds, the Ra Gada first landed on the isles of &lt;a href=\"Herne%20%28Lore%29\"&gt;Herne&lt;/a&gt;, and then continued onto the other eastern isles and to the mainland by way of the Hew's Bane peninsula. The Redguards\u2014as the Ra Gada came to be called\u2014were a fierce and warlike people, and easily conquered the Breton and &lt;a href=\"Imperial\"&gt;Imperial&lt;/a&gt; peoples along with the savage beasts and beast-folk of the province.\nThe Redguards, due to their warrior prowess, managed to capture all of Hammerfell in a few battles. They quickly built cities atop the ruins of newly conquered cities and ancient ones alike, and within a matter of years the province was theirs. The Imperial, &lt;a href=\"Nord\"&gt;Nord&lt;/a&gt;, and Breton peoples did not forgive the Redguards after the conquest of their lands, and skirmishes continued along the borders for the rest of the century.\nOnly when the &lt;a href=\"Orsimer\"&gt;Orsimer&lt;/a&gt; nation of &lt;a href=\"Orsinium\"&gt;Orsinium&lt;/a&gt; appeared to challenge their dominance did the Redguards join forces with the Bretons. An alliance of the &lt;a href=\"Sword%20Singer\"&gt;Sword Singer&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Order%20of%20Diagna\"&gt;Order of Diagna&lt;/a&gt;, led by &lt;a href=\"Gaiden%20Shinji\"&gt;Gaiden Shinji&lt;/a&gt;; the &lt;a href=\"kingdom%20of%20Daggerfall\"&gt;kingdom of Daggerfall&lt;/a&gt;, led by King &lt;a href=\"Joile\"&gt;Joile&lt;/a&gt;; and the armies of Sentinel, began an epic siege of Orsinium in the year 950. After thirty years of constant warfare, the Orc kingdom proved to be too much for the alliance. This shared battle led to improved diplomacy between the Redguards and their neighbors. The Redguards opened their borders for trade and to assist other nations in their own wars\u2014such as the alliance with &lt;a href=\"Bendu%20Olo\"&gt;Bendu Olo&lt;/a&gt; of the Cyrodilic kingdom of &lt;a href=\"Anvil\"&gt;Anvil&lt;/a&gt; against the &lt;a href=\"Sload\"&gt;Sload&lt;/a&gt;.\nBringing in experience from their native Yokuda, the Redguards were able to tame the harsh land and thrive where others perished. Their culture, religion, and even government were transplanted whole to the new land and their civilization flourished. The new environment did however bring about change. The &lt;a href=\"Yoku\"&gt;Yoku&lt;/a&gt; language was replaced with the common tongue of &lt;a href=\"Tamriel\"&gt;Tamriel&lt;/a&gt; to better trade with their neighbors, and some of the Ra Gada gods, minor deities in particular, began to take on more Tamrielic aspects. Many of the lower class Yoku and the Ra Gada wanted to adapt and assimilate to the ways of their new land, while the upper class and the &lt;a href=\"Na-Totambu\"&gt;Na-Totambu&lt;/a&gt;, or ruling class, wanted to keep their traditional ways.\nCities along the border, such as Sentinel in the north and &lt;a href=\"Rihad\"&gt;Rihad&lt;/a&gt; in the south, adapted particularly fast to the new Tamrielic culture. Trade and cultural interaction encouraged assimilation, and the peoples in those areas became increasingly Imperial. Over time, their views and customs differed enough from that of the traditional Redguards for them to separate into a wholly new sociopolitical faction: The &lt;a href=\"Forebears\"&gt;Forebears&lt;/a&gt;. Tension between the factions continued to build for the next two thousand years.\nSecond Era.\nIn the year 862 of the &lt;a href=\"Second%20Era\"&gt;Second Era&lt;/a&gt;, High King &lt;a href=\"Thassad%20II\"&gt;Thassad II&lt;/a&gt; died of natural causes and the province plunged into a bloody civil war between the &lt;a href=\"The%20Crowns\"&gt;Crowns&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Forebears\"&gt;Forebears&lt;/a&gt;. Prince &lt;a href=\"A%27Tor\"&gt;A'Tor&lt;/a&gt;, heir to the throne of Hammerfell, led the Crown forces against the Forebears. Just as the Crown victory appeared certain, the Forebears made a pact with &lt;a href=\"Tiber%20Septim\"&gt;Tiber Septim&lt;/a&gt;, who agreed to send his forces into Hammerfell to defeat A'Tor in exchange for Hammerfell's allegiance to the &lt;a href=\"Septim%20Empire\"&gt;Septim Empire&lt;/a&gt;.\nTiber crushed the weakened Crown forces and took mainland Hammerfell. A'Tor and the loyal Crown forces were forced to flee to Stros M'kai, an island fortress in the south of Hammerfell. At the &lt;a href=\"Battle%20of%20Hunding%20Bay\"&gt;Battle of Hunding Bay&lt;/a&gt;, A'Tor met the forces of Tiber Septim in a magnificent naval battle. Just as the Crown forces were about to defeat the &lt;a href=\"Imperial%20Navy\"&gt;Imperial Navy&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Dram\"&gt;Dram&lt;/a&gt;, a famous &lt;a href=\"Dunmer\"&gt;Dunmer&lt;/a&gt; assassin, shot Prince A'Tor with a poisoned arrow. The &lt;a href=\"Dragons%20%28Lore%29\"&gt;Dragon&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Nafaalilargus\"&gt;Nafaalilagus&lt;/a&gt;, thrall of the Empire, burned down the remaining Redguard forces\u2014and with them, the hopes of Hammerfell's sovereignty. Tiber Septim garrisoned Imperial forces in each of Hammerfell's cities and installed Imperial governors to rule the province.\nShortly after, in the year &lt;a href=\"2E%20864\"&gt;2E 864&lt;/a&gt;, rebellion again arose on Stros M'kai. &lt;a href=\"Cyrus%20%28Redguard%29\"&gt;Cyrus&lt;/a&gt;, a Redguard mercenary, defeated first Nafaalilagus and then Governor &lt;a href=\"Amiel%20Richton\"&gt;Amiel Richton&lt;/a&gt;, forcing Tiber Septim to sue for peace with Hammerfell. The Empire conceded to let Hammerfell keep many of their traditions and government, and removed the Imperial garrisons and governors from the provinces.\nCyrus, Sura in the Yoku tongue, was the center of many legends. Many Redguard considered him an incarnation of the &lt;a href=\"HoonDing\"&gt;HoonDing&lt;/a&gt;\u2014the Yokudan god of Make Way and Perseverance over Infidels\u2014due to his defeat of the Empire at Stros M'kai. Additionally, there were legends of him battling the Dunmer god &lt;a href=\"Vivec\"&gt;Vivec&lt;/a&gt; among the wreckage of Yokuda.\nThird Era.\nThe coming of the Empire only widened the rift between the Crowns and Forebears however. When the &lt;a href=\"Camoran%20Usurper\"&gt;Camoran Usurper&lt;/a&gt; marched on Hammerfell, the Crowns refused assistance to their Forebear brethren in Rihad and &lt;a href=\"Taneth\"&gt;Taneth&lt;/a&gt;, leading to their defeat and the fall of southern Hammerfell in the &lt;a href=\"Battle%20of%20Dragontooth\"&gt;Battle of Dragontooth&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"3E%20253\"&gt;3E 253&lt;/a&gt;. The Camoran Usurper decimated much of western Hammerfell until he was finally defeated by the navy of High Rock.\nNeither did the Forebears come to the assistance of the Crowns in &lt;a href=\"3E%20396\"&gt;3E 396&lt;/a&gt;, when the Nords attacked Hammerfell in what was known in the Third Era as the &lt;a href=\"War%20of%20Bend%27r-Mahk\"&gt;War of Bend'r-Mahk&lt;/a&gt;. That division left Hammerfell weakened, allowing the Nords to capture significant parts of eastern Hammerfell, including the cities of &lt;a href=\"Elinhir\"&gt;Elinhir&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Dragonstar\"&gt;Dragonstar&lt;/a&gt;. Dragonstar became divided into two distinct cities, its eastern half controlled by Skyrim and its western half controlled by Hammerfell. That division remained into the Fourth Era.\nWar came again to Hammerfell in the year &lt;a href=\"3E%20402\"&gt;3E 402&lt;/a&gt;, when the kingdoms of Sentinel and Daggerfall went to war over who was to control &lt;a href=\"Betony\"&gt;Betony Island&lt;/a&gt; in the Iliac Bay. Priest &lt;a href=\"Vanech\"&gt;Vanech&lt;/a&gt; of Daggerfall considered the island a holy realm of &lt;a href=\"Kynareth\"&gt;Kynareth&lt;/a&gt; and refused to cede it to Hammerfell. The High Rock city-state &lt;a href=\"Reich%20Gradkeep\"&gt;Reich Gradkeep&lt;/a&gt; agreed to meditate between &lt;a href=\"Lysandus\"&gt;Lysandus&lt;/a&gt; of Daggerfall and &lt;a href=\"Camaron\"&gt;Camaron&lt;/a&gt; of Sentinel. At those negotiations, Vanech submitted a fake treaty which upset Camaron and eventually plunged the city-state into chaos. Total war erupted between Daggerfall and Sentinel. The war reached its climax at the &lt;a href=\"Battle%20of%20Cryngaine%20Field\"&gt;Battle of Cryngaine Field&lt;/a&gt;. King Lysandus was slain on the field of battle, and his son, &lt;a href=\"Gothryd\"&gt;Gothryd&lt;/a&gt;, was crowned King of Daggerfall. King Camaron was likewise slain, and Lord &lt;a href=\"Oresme\"&gt;Oresme&lt;/a&gt; surrendered to High Rock.\nIn an attempt to cement peace between the rival states of Sentinel and Daggerfall, King Gothryd of Daggerfall was married to Princess &lt;a href=\"Aubk%27i\"&gt;Aubk-I&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"Sentinel\"&gt;Sentinel&lt;/a&gt;.\nIn the year &lt;a href=\"3E%20417\"&gt;3E 417&lt;/a&gt; conflict again plagued the Iliac Bay region as the kingdoms of Sentinel, Daggerfall, &lt;a href=\"Wayrest\"&gt;Wayrest&lt;/a&gt;, and Orsinium, as well as the &lt;a href=\"Blades\"&gt;Blades&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"Underking\"&gt;Underking&lt;/a&gt;, and the &lt;a href=\"Order%20of%20the%20Black%20Worm\"&gt;Order of the Black Worm&lt;/a&gt;, vied over the control of the &lt;a href=\"Numidium\"&gt;Numidium&lt;/a&gt;, a powerful Dwemer golem used by Tiber Septim to conquer the continent. The &lt;a href=\"Mantella\"&gt;Mantella&lt;/a&gt;, a device needed to power the Numidium, was in the hands of the &lt;a href=\"Hero%20of%20Daggerfall\"&gt;Hero of Daggerfall&lt;/a&gt;.\nIn the end, it was not known who received control of the Numidium. It was said that the various squabbling factions destroyed each other, bringing about the mysterious event known as the &lt;a href=\"Dragonbreak\"&gt;Dragonbreak&lt;/a&gt;, or, in that case, the &lt;a href=\"Miracle%20of%20Peace\"&gt;Miracle of Peace&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe Miracle of Peace redefined politics in the Iliac Bay. High Rock, once a realm of over a hundred squabbling city-states, consisted of only three after the Miracle of Peace: Daggerfall, Wayrest, and &lt;a href=\"Nova%20Orsinium\"&gt;Nova Orsinium&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href=\"Mannimarco\"&gt;Mannimarco&lt;/a&gt;, the King of Worms and the leader of the Order of the Black Worm, ascended into godhood and the Underking was able to die a mortal death after the Mantella, which was made from his life-force, was returned to him. Finally, there was peace between High Rock, Hammerfell, and Orsinium. Following the Miracle of Peace, the Forebear kingdom of Sentinel grew to encompass the entirety of the northern coast of Hammerfell, for Abibon-Gora in the west to Satakalaam in the east, at the mouth of the Bjoulsae River. As most of the formerly independent lands in this northern area were Crown in sympathy, King Lhotun was continually involved in military, diplomatic, and even religious missions to keep them under his wing. Lhotun was forced to create what some considered a third party, one with reverence for the Yokudan past but respect for the Imperial ways which, appropriately enough, came to be called the Lhotunic.\nUnsurprisingly, the moderate Lhotunics attracted nothing but contempt from the Crown and Forebear kingdoms alike. Clavilla, the Queen of Taneth, tried without success to have the charters of the independent guilds revoked from all sentinel lands, saying that the accepted worship of Satakal was grounds enough for heresy against the Empire. Ayaan-si, High Prophet of Elinhir, called upon the True Crowns of the north to rebel against Lhotun, and financed a number of forays against the borders in Bergama and Dak'fron. His one success was significant. The land of Totambu, named in ancient days after the Na-Totambu of Yokuda, the progenitors of the Crowns, returned to his fold and declared independence from Sentinel. As Lhotun's kingdom surrounded Totambu on all four sides, it was questionable how much longer it could have afforded to assert itself, but nonetheless, its people held their resistance.\nEastern Hammerfell, less concerned with Sentinel, continued its efforts to take back the lands conquered by Skyrim in the War of Bend'r-Mahk. There was no question that Redguards, while lacking the cohesiveness as a society to form effective armies, were once and still remain, excellent warriors and unmatched in guerrilla warfare. Still, little ground was regained, for the Nords too were renowned warriors.\nFourth Era.\nThe Fourth Era\u00a0made the Empire\u00a0even more of\u00a0a shadow of its former glory. &lt;a href=\"Valenwood\"&gt;Valenwood&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Elsweyr\"&gt;Elsweyr&lt;/a&gt; had been ceded to the &lt;a href=\"Thalmor\"&gt;Thalmor&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Black%20Marsh\"&gt;Black Marsh&lt;/a&gt; had been lost to Imperial rule since the &lt;a href=\"Oblivion%20Crisis\"&gt;Oblivion Crisis&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Morrowind\"&gt;Morrowind&lt;/a&gt; had yet to fully recover from the eruption of Red Mountain,\u00a0and Hammerfell was plagued by infighting between the &lt;a href=\"The%20Crowns\"&gt;Crowns&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Forebears\"&gt;Forebears&lt;/a&gt; factions. Only &lt;a href=\"Skyrim\"&gt;Skyrim&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"High%20Rock\"&gt;High Rock&lt;/a&gt;\u00a0and &lt;a href=\"Cyrodiil\"&gt;Cyrodiil&lt;/a&gt; remained prosperous.\n&lt;a href=\"4E%20171\"&gt;4E 171&lt;/a&gt; \u2014 The &lt;a href=\"Great%20War\"&gt;Great War&lt;/a&gt; begins with armies from the &lt;a href=\"Aldmeri%20Dominion%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Aldmeri Dominion&lt;/a&gt; invading the Imperial provinces of Hammerfell and Cyrodiil.\nAfter Titus II rejects an ultimatum to make massive concessions to the Thalmor, Aldmeri armies invade. An army led by Thalmor general Lord Naarifin emerges from hidden camps in northern Elsweyr and assaults southern Cyrodiil, flanking Imperial defenses along the Valenwood border. Leyawiin falls to the invaders, and Bravil is surrounded and besieged. Simultaneously, an army under Lady Arannelya crosses western Cyrodiil, bypassing Anvil and Kvatch and entering Hammerfell. This army is joined by smaller forces landing on Hammerfell's coast. Imperial troops are overrun and forced into retreat across the &lt;a href=\"Alik%27r%20Desert\"&gt;Alik'r Desert&lt;/a&gt; in what is known as the &lt;a href=\"March%20of%20Thirst\"&gt;March of Thirst&lt;/a&gt;.\n&lt;a href=\"4E%20172\"&gt;4E 172&lt;/a&gt; \u2014 In Hammerfell, the Thalmor consolidated their gains as they took control of the whole southern coastline. Of the southern cities, only &lt;a href=\"Hegathe\"&gt;Hegathe&lt;/a&gt; still held out. The survivors of the March of Thirst regrouped in northern Hammerfell, joined by reinforcements from High Rock.\n&lt;a href=\"4E%20173\"&gt;4E 173&lt;/a&gt; \u2014 A &lt;a href=\"Forebear\"&gt;Forebear&lt;/a&gt; army from &lt;a href=\"Sentinel\"&gt;Sentinel&lt;/a&gt; broke the siege of Hegathe (a &lt;a href=\"The%20Crowns\"&gt;Crown&lt;/a&gt; city), leading to the reconciliation of the two factions. Despite this, Lady Arannelya's main army succeeded in crossing the Alik'r Desert. The Imperial Legions under General Decianus met them outside &lt;a href=\"Skaven\"&gt;Skaven&lt;/a&gt; in a bloody and indecisive clash. Decianus withdrew and left Arannelya in possession of Skaven, but the Aldmeri were too weakened to continue their advance.\n&lt;a href=\"4E%20174\"&gt;4E 174&lt;/a&gt; \u2014 The &lt;a href=\"Imperial%20City\"&gt;Imperial City&lt;/a&gt; is sacked by Aldmeri forces.\nTitus II flees north from the city, smashing through the surrounding Aldmeri forces with his main army and linking up with reinforcements heading south from Skyrim under General Jonna. The &lt;a href=\"Imperial%20City\"&gt;Imperial City&lt;/a&gt; falls to the invaders. The Imperial Palace is burned, &lt;a href=\"White-Gold%20Tower\"&gt;White-Gold Tower&lt;/a&gt; is looted, and the Aldmeri commit many atrocities against the defenseless populace.\nIn Hammerfell, General Decianus was preparing to drive the Aldmeri back from Skaven when he was ordered to march for Cyrodiil. Unwilling to abandon Hammerfell completely, he allowed a great number of \"invalids\" to be discharged from the Legions before they marched east. These veterans formed the core of the army that eventually drove Lady Arannelya's forces back across the Alik'r late in 174, taking heavy losses on their retreat from harassing attacks by the Alik'r warriors.\n&lt;a href=\"4E%20175\"&gt;4E 175&lt;/a&gt; \u2014 The &lt;a href=\"Battle%20of%20the%20Red%20Ring\"&gt;Battle of the Red Ring&lt;/a&gt; results in the complete destruction of the Aldmeri army in Cyrodiil, a victory for the Empire precipitating the end of the Great War.\nThe Imperial City is retaken and Titus II's decision to withdraw from it the previous year is vindicated. Despite this resounding victory, however, the Empire is exhausted and unable to continue the war. Realizing this, Titus II seeks to negotiate with the Aldmeri Dominion to end the war.\nThe Great War ends with the &lt;a href=\"White-Gold%20Concordat\"&gt;White-Gold Concordat&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe Concordat is a peace treaty between the Empire and the Aldmeri Dominion. The terms of treaty gave the Thalmor free rein to stamp out the worship of Talos throughout the Empire, and ceded a large section of southern Hammerfell. Critics note that these terms are almost identical to the ultimatum that &lt;a href=\"Titus%20Mede%20II\"&gt;Titus Mede II&lt;/a&gt; rejected at the start of the war.\nHammerfell leaves the Empire after rejecting the White-Gold Concordat.\nTitus II renounces Hammerfell as a province of the Empire to preserve the treaty after the Redguards oppose ceding their lands. The Redguards see this as a betrayal, and a lasting bitterness between Hammerfell and the Empire is sown to the delight of the Thalmor. Hammerfell continues to war with the Aldmeri Dominion for the next five years and southern Hammerfell is left devastated.\n&lt;a href=\"4E%20180\"&gt;4E 180&lt;/a&gt; \u2014 The &lt;a href=\"Second%20Treaty%20of%20Stros%20M%27kai\"&gt;Second Treaty of Stros M'kai&lt;/a&gt; is signed.\nHaving been fought to a standstill by the Redguards, the Aldmeri Dominion completely withdraws from Hammerfell. Also, through the cooperation between Forebearers and Crowns, the civil war in Hammerfell ends. Despite the signing of the Treaty of Stros M'kai, &lt;a href=\"Kematu\"&gt;Kematu&lt;/a&gt; claims that the resistance against the Aldmeri Dominion is alive and well in Hammerfell.\nReligion.\nThe main religion of Hammerfell is a combination of the traditional Yokudan pantheon and ancestor worship.\nGeography.\nHammerfell is a tropical-arid land consisting of a variety of climates such as jungles, deserts, mountains, grasslands and more. The few forests of Hammerfell are found mainly along the coasts and along the borders between Hammerfell, High Rock, and Skyrim. The rugged &lt;a href=\"Dragontail%20Mountains\"&gt;Dragontail Mountains&lt;/a&gt; line northern Hammerfell's border with Skyrim. The &lt;a href=\"Colovian%20Highlands\"&gt;Colovian Highlands&lt;/a&gt; make up part of Hammerfell's southern border with Cyrodiil. The southeastern region of Hammerfell is occupied by grasslands similar to those found in the &lt;a href=\"Gold%20Coast\"&gt;Gold Coast&lt;/a&gt; region of Cyrodiil. &lt;a href=\"Dak%27fron\"&gt;Dak'fron&lt;/a&gt;, a rocky region in the northwestern parts of Hammerfell, borders the Dragontail Mountains and perhaps the most prominent geographical feature of Hammerfell\u2014the &lt;a href=\"Alik%27r%20Desert\"&gt;Alik'r Desert&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe Alik'r Desert takes up all of the western region of Hammerfell, and is widely regarded as the most inhospitable region in all of &lt;a href=\"Tamriel\"&gt;Tamriel&lt;/a&gt;. Until the coming of the Ra Gada in the eight hundreds of the &lt;a href=\"First%20Era\"&gt;First Era&lt;/a&gt;, the deserts were populated only by monstrous beasts, including giant scorpions. While the fauna of the Alik'r Desert remained deadly into the &lt;a href=\"Third%20Era\"&gt;Third Era&lt;/a&gt;, the Redguards have managed to significantly reduce the presence and threat of those creatures. The Alik'r Desert also is home to the ruins of countless civilizations that had perished beneath its sands. Its blazing heat, ferocious sandstorms, and lack of water, makes it nearly impossible to survive in the Alik'r Desert. The Desert is inhabited only by the nomadic Dune Dweller Redguards.\nMajor cities.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Alik%27r%20Desert\"&gt;Alik'r Desert&lt;/a&gt; is a region of northern Hammerfell within the &lt;a href=\"Iliac%20Bay\"&gt;Iliac Bay&lt;/a&gt; region. The Alik'r Desert also completely surrounds the province of &lt;a href=\"Bergama\"&gt;Bergama&lt;/a&gt;. The provincial seat is the city of &lt;a href=\"Alik%27r\"&gt;Alik'r&lt;/a&gt;. During the &lt;a href=\"Warp%20in%20the%20West\"&gt;Warp in the West&lt;/a&gt;, the Alik'r Desert region became a part of the city-state of &lt;a href=\"Sentinel\"&gt;Sentinel&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href=\"Dragonstar\"&gt;Dragonstar&lt;/a&gt; is a city just south of the border with &lt;a href=\"High%20Rock\"&gt;High Rock&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Skyrim\"&gt;Skyrim&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href=\"Elinhir\"&gt;Elinhir&lt;/a&gt; is a city in eastern Hammerfell, close to the border with both Skyrim and &lt;a href=\"Cyrodiil\"&gt;Cyrodiil&lt;/a&gt;. It is close to the Skyrim city of &lt;a href=\"Falkreath\"&gt;Falkreath&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href=\"Gilane\"&gt;Gilane&lt;/a&gt; is a city in southern Hammerfell lying west of &lt;a href=\"Taneth\"&gt;Taneth&lt;/a&gt; and southeast of Sentinel. The ruins of the capital city of the &lt;a href=\"Rourken%20Clan\"&gt;Rourken Clan&lt;/a&gt; can be found nearby. &lt;a href=\"Hegathe\"&gt;Hegathe&lt;/a&gt; is a large city in southwestern Hammerfell, to the south of Sentinel. In the &lt;a href=\"Merethic%20Era\"&gt;Merethic Era&lt;/a&gt;, 'Hegathe' was the name given to Hammerfell by the &lt;a href=\"Aldmer\"&gt;Aldmer&lt;/a&gt;.\n&lt;a href=\"Rihad\"&gt;Rihad&lt;/a&gt; is a port city at the southern edge of Hammerfell, just north of its border with Cyrodiil. Rihad is located on the coast of the &lt;a href=\"Abecean%20Sea\"&gt;Abecean Sea&lt;/a&gt;, on the main road between &lt;a href=\"Anvil\"&gt;Anvil&lt;/a&gt; and Taneth. The &lt;a href=\"Brena%20River\"&gt;Brena River&lt;/a&gt; flows into the Abecean Sea just south of the city. The city is an eclectic mix of &lt;a href=\"Redguard\"&gt;Redguard&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Forebears\"&gt;Forebears&lt;/a&gt;, survivors of the &lt;a href=\"Yokuda\"&gt;Yokuda&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Ra%20Gada\"&gt;Ra Gada&lt;/a&gt;, followers of &lt;a href=\"Satakal\"&gt;Satakal&lt;/a&gt;, a few &lt;a href=\"Bretons\"&gt;Bretons&lt;/a&gt;, and warriors-in-training from all over &lt;a href=\"Tamriel\"&gt;Tamriel&lt;/a&gt;. Buildings in the city with their flying domes, flying dew sails, and the mosaic colophons were constructed over the ruins of past civilizations. In &lt;a href=\"3E%20253\"&gt;3E 253&lt;/a&gt;, armies of Taneth and Rihad were defeated in the &lt;a href=\"Battle%20of%20Dragontooth\"&gt;Battle of Dragontooth&lt;/a&gt; by the &lt;a href=\"Camoran%20Usurper\"&gt;Camoran Usurper&lt;/a&gt;, which led to the fall of southern Hammerfell. The city was the birthplace of the well-known historian &lt;a href=\"Destri%20Melarg\"&gt;Destri Melarg&lt;/a&gt;.\nJudging by its location, the Kingdom of Sentinel is nothing other than a merchant power: it is situated on the rocky, infertile northern hills of Hammerfell overlooking the Iliac Bay. It is bordered by &lt;a href=\"Myrkwasa\"&gt;Myrkwasa&lt;/a&gt; and the Alik'r Desert to the south, and by &lt;a href=\"Antiphyllos\"&gt;Antiphyllos&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Ayasofya\"&gt;Ayasofya&lt;/a&gt; to the east. The uninhabited isle of &lt;a href=\"Cybiades\"&gt;Cybiades&lt;/a&gt; lies off the coast to the north. It was built in the time of the first Redguard colonization of Hammerfell, to serve as a base for their battles against the Bretons, but has since been expanded by the Third Era. The main city streets of Sentinel are a great market leading from the docks to the front gates. Sentinel is an exotic retreat for the nobility of &lt;a href=\"Daggerfall\"&gt;Daggerfall&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Wayrest\"&gt;Wayrest&lt;/a&gt;, who take delight in the exotic cooking, craftsmanship, and bizarre plays.\n&lt;a href=\"Skaven\"&gt;Skaven&lt;/a&gt; is a city in north-central Hammerfell. Once the home of &lt;a href=\"The%20Crowns\"&gt;Crown Prince&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"A%27Tor\"&gt;A'Tor&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Stros%20M%27kai\"&gt;Stros M'kai&lt;/a&gt; is an important mountainous island off the southern coast of Hammerfell near the &lt;a href=\"Cape%20of%20the%20Blue%20Divide\"&gt;Cape of the Blue Divide&lt;/a&gt;. Stros M'kai is renown for its completely steam-powered &lt;a href=\"Dwemer\"&gt;Dwemer&lt;/a&gt; ruins, including the marvelous observatory known as the &lt;a href=\"Orrery\"&gt;Orrery&lt;/a&gt;. Taneth is a city in southern Hammerfell on the Abecean Sea lying northwest of Rihad and east of Gilane."}

The Crowns wanted Hammerfell to remain sovereign, while the Forebears had accepted Tiber Septim's rule.\nHistory.\nThe civil war erupted when the &lt;a href=\"High%20King\"&gt;High King&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Thassad%20II\"&gt;Thassad II&lt;/a&gt;, died from natural causes. Following his death, the Forebears took over &lt;a href=\"Sentinel\"&gt;Sentinel&lt;/a&gt; in a &lt;a href=\"Volag%27s%20Purge\"&gt;massacre&lt;/a&gt; of the Crowns, which resulted in Crown prince A'Tor sailing to mainland Hammerfell from &lt;a href=\"Stros%20M%27kai\"&gt;Stros M'kai&lt;/a&gt;. When he arrived at Sentinel one of the bloodiest massacres in &lt;a href=\"Tamriel\"&gt;Tamrielic&lt;/a&gt; history took place. Following this, the Crowns were starting to win the war, pushing the Forebears back across Hammerfell's sands. However, the Forebears saw that defeat would come without outside intervention, so they made a &lt;a href=\"Forebear%20Truce\"&gt;pact&lt;/a&gt; with the &lt;a href=\"Emperor\"&gt;Emperor&lt;/a&gt; allowing his Legions in, crush the Crowns and claim parts of Hammerfell as his own. The Imperial Legions proved too strong for the proud Redguard crowns. The final &lt;a href=\"Battle%20of%20Hunding%20Bay\"&gt;battle&lt;/a&gt; was at Stros M'Kai, where the &lt;a href=\"New%20West%20Navy\"&gt;New West Navy&lt;/a&gt; fought against the &lt;a href=\"Crown%20Navy\"&gt;Crown Navy&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"A%27Tor\"&gt;A'Tor&lt;/a&gt;. Knowing that Hammerfell's independence is at stake, the &lt;a href=\"The%20Crowns\"&gt;Crown&lt;/a&gt; forces match the might of the Empire. When &lt;a href=\"Dram\"&gt;Dram&lt;/a&gt; shot the Price and &lt;a href=\"Nafalilargus\"&gt;Nafalilargus&lt;/a&gt; burned down the Crown forces, the Civil War was over. However, when Baron Volag disappeared, the terms between the Forebears and the Empire were changed. Instead of assisting the Forebears, the Imperial Legions invaded Hammerfell, set up garrisons and appointed governors to rule over the cities of Hammerfell, making Hammerfell subject to the Empire."}

I'm hoping this primer can help you make your home a relaxing place to return to after a hard day (or night) of adventuring!\nFirst off, you'll notice that you have a blank slate in terms of furnishings. So, where do you acquire furniture? This handy list can help!\n- Shop at Home Goods and Achievement Furnisher vendors in major towns throughout Tamriel. You can also look for Zanil Theran if you have gold to burn.\n- Craft your own using plans! You can find plans in all sorts of places while adventuring and via guild traders, plus some merchants keep stock on hand.\n- Guilds also often have furnishings for sale on their traders.\n- Dig up antiquities. Visit Verita Numida in Solitude and join the Antiquarian Circle. Sometimes you can uncover thrones, music boxes, valuable display pieces, and more to add to your home.\n- Treasure chests may contain paintings you can add to your walls.\n- Harvesting and fishing provide plant- and fish-based decorations\u2014if you're lucky!\n- You can hang trophies and show off busts of your Undaunted victories in your home.\n- Take part in Tamriel's festivals! You may just end up with keepsakes you can showcase.\n- Your guildmates and fellow adventurers may also point you to other places to acquire furnishings\u2014I've listed only a few here for you.\nAfter you have a furnishing to add to your home, you can place it in the perfect spot. Bear in mind that you have limited space in this home, so everything you buy or otherwise acquire may not fit.\nIf that happens, you can store items in the bank. If you've coin, you can spend it to acquire more houses, too. Only your budget limits you in terms of how many homes you can buy!\nSome of the furnishings you can add to your home assist you in any hobbies or crafts you may have taken up to help you on your adventures. For instance, you can add a Target Skeleton or a Blacksmithing Station. Or both! Or several! As with other furnishings, though, you may run out of space in your household, so choose wisely and consider acquiring some special storage chests. I know I'm hoping to upgrade to a few Grand Master Crafting Stations soon myself.\nAs you're adding furniture to your home, you may wish to make comfortable nooks for others and host other people as house guests. I don't know about you, but seeing my guests and pets moving around my own home gives me a warm feeling. One even became my assistant and does my banking for me, which is handy. Just remember to keep an eye on how many folks and creatures you take in\u2014the space holds only so many.\nNow, you may have some adventuring comrades and guildmates out there you'd like to share your home with. If you give them permission to visit your home, they can visit whenever they wish, provided you don't already have too many people visiting. If you need help moving around furniture, you can also have them help you out. And, of course, don't worry about thieves or other uninvited guests.\nOnce you've set up your home to your liking, you may want to show it off to others. All you need to do is add it to the list of homes available for touring and you're set. If you change your mind, you can always remove it from the touring list. I love seeing what others do with their homes, and you might find it fun and inspirational to peek at what other homeowners have designed, too.\nI could share so much more with you, but this should get you started. And remember: If you're looking for a nice home in an inn, please come find me. I'm often inside the inn in major towns, looking for good tenants. You're always welcome to chat with me there.\nYour friend in all things home-worthy,\n&lt;a href=\"Felande%20Demarie\"&gt;Felande Demarie&lt;/a&gt;"}

They can only be used one-handed, so a &lt;a href=\"Shields%20%28Blades%29\"&gt;shield&lt;/a&gt; in the off-hand is recommended. The &lt;a href=\"Scout%20%28Blades%29\"&gt;Scout&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Perks%20%28Blades%29\"&gt;perk&lt;/a&gt; improves the damage output.\nAn &lt;a href=\"Enchanting%20%28Blades%29\"&gt;enchanted&lt;/a&gt; light weapon can deal as much damage as a normal versatile weapon while having a higher attack speed, making them more advantageous to use. Using light weapons, one can bait the enemy to raise their shield prematurely, turning a high block into a low block and stopping all damage barring shield &lt;a href=\"bash\"&gt;bash&lt;/a&gt;es. Because they deal low damage compared to other weapons, they can prove difficult to use efficiently without practice and quick enough responses.\nThe following is a list of light weapons:\nVersatile Weapons.\nVersatile weapons can be used both one-handed, to carry a shield, and two-handed, to deal extra damage. The &lt;a href=\"Armsman%20%28Blades%29\"&gt;Armsman&lt;/a&gt; perk improves the damage output. They neither benefit nor suffer greatly from combos or crits.\nSince versatile weapons have both better damage and better enhancements than light weapons, their damage easily surpasses the latter, making them easier to use. For enemies with predictable moves, one can wield a versatile weapon with both hands, without suffering much of the penalty. By using versatile weapons, one does not have to rely as much on combos to deal damage compared to light weapons, meaning the player is less affected by the blocking action of enemies that interrupt such movements.\nThe following is a list of versatile weapons:\nHeavy Weapons.\nAlthough a heavy weapon's attack is slow and gets little benefit from combo attacks, they can deal the highest damage out of all the weapons types, with devastating critical hits. They can only be used two-handed. The &lt;a href=\"Barbarian%20%28Blades%29\"&gt;Barbarian&lt;/a&gt; perk improves the damage output, as well as the &lt;a href=\"Puncture\"&gt;Puncture&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Enchanting%20%28Blades%29\"&gt;enchantment&lt;/a&gt;.\nThese weapons are best for ending a fight quickly. A heavy weapon is especially effective when striking an enemy that has missed their blow and has become staggered. Since they have the most powerful enchantments, even with small combos, they do great damage. Since they swing slow, they can be the easiest to use, while their critical damage window is the also longest.\nThe following is a list of heavy weapons:"}

He claims he can improve the town's &lt;a href=\"Lurcher%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Lurcher&lt;/a&gt; guardians with elemental abilities. For this, he requires Dew Bugs, &lt;a href=\"Thunderbug\"&gt;Thunderbug&lt;/a&gt; Bellies and Hive Seeds, which he will ask you to collect. \nThe Dew Bugs can be found around your current area; there are also plenty of beehives for you to harvest.

He will tell you how to create your own elemental guardian; simply interact with the guardian in front of Benduin and insert two of the ingredients; Dew Bugs and Hive Seeds will make a Wooden Guardian, Dew Bugs and Thunderbug Bellies will make a Water Guardian and Hive Seeds and Thunderbug Bellies will make a Fire Guardian. \n\"&lt;You can reach your hand through the opening in the head to deposit your choice of reagents.&gt;\"\nNext, you must have your guardian defeat two other guardians. You will find three guardian opponents in the area, one for each element. The guardian types interact in a rock-paper-scissors-esque manner, in that fire beats wood, wood beats water and water beats fire. Your best bet therefore is to have your guardian fight the guardian it is strong against and the guardian it is neutral to. If your guardian is struggling, you can heal it with the glowing roots Benduin gave you. Once your guardian has beaten two other guardians, return to Benduin to finish the quest."}

Given his dark hood you might think it was a dangerous spell. But so long as no one's hair caught on fire or found imps in their cupboards, the words were harmless. Just the mad ramblings of a drunk.\nOf the inn patrons, only I bothered to humor him. We bonded over a bottle of &lt;a href=\"Honningbrew%20Mead\"&gt;Honningbrew&lt;/a&gt; and the bucket with which we had history.\nSo when the Elf bit the dust, it was only natural he left his things to me. Among them were countless pieces of junk, including full ownership of the bucket and a spell tome written in some long ancient language.\nBut as soon as I started cursing the old fool for willing me his trash, out slipped two items of value, a map and &lt;a href=\"Sindnar%27s%20Tower%20Notes\"&gt;notes&lt;/a&gt; to a tower deep in the swamps. It was only after reading it that I realized his drunken words weren't part of any limerick. They were instructions. A way in.\nNow that I'm here, things are getting even more clear. The hair part still doesn't make a lick of sense, but the eye is the stone seal, that much I'm sure. Yet nothing I do seems to work. I've doused it in the fire from my torch. I've chopped kindling for hours and built a bonfire high enough to scorch the bloody moon. Still, nothing.\nMaybe the seal can only be broken with magic. Well, if that drunken fool can learn to cast spells, so can I. I've got the bastard's tome, I just need to make sense of the words.\nBut I better be quick. The fire seems to be attracting all sorts of creatures from the belly of this unholy marsh. Hopefully I can manage to survive long enough to discover whatever treasure lies within."}

After a reign of 78 years, he died in &lt;a href=\"1E%20221\"&gt;1E 221&lt;/a&gt; at the exceptional age of 108 years. He outlived all but three of his sons.\nHe was the thirteenth of the line of &lt;a href=\"Ysgramor\"&gt;Ysgramor&lt;/a&gt;, and is remembered as being the first King to relinquish all holdings in &lt;a href=\"Atmora\"&gt;Atmora&lt;/a&gt;. Thus it was he that truly made the Nords a separate people, whose faces were turned firmly toward their destiny, the conquest of the vast new land of &lt;a href=\"Tamriel\"&gt;Tamriel&lt;/a&gt;.Indeed, the history of the Nords is the history of &lt;a href=\"Men\"&gt;humans&lt;/a&gt; in Tamriel; all the human races, with the exception of the &lt;a href=\"Redguards\"&gt;Redguards&lt;/a&gt;, are descended from Nordic stock, although in some the ancient blood admittedly runs thin.\nRandagulf.\n&lt;a href=\"Randagulf\"&gt;Randagulf&lt;/a&gt; of the Begalin Clan, is recorded as being one of the mightiest warriors from &lt;a href=\"Skyrim\"&gt;Skyrim&lt;/a&gt;. He was known for his courage and ferocity in battle, and on many occasions, his participation was a major contributor to their victory. When Harald conquered Skyrim, Randagulf was defeated. So respectful of this great hero was Harald, that he took his &lt;a href=\"Fists%20of%20Randagulf\"&gt;gauntlets&lt;/a&gt; as his own. These gauntlets, worn by both mighty warriors, are believed to give the wearer additional strength.\nSnow Elves.\nIn &lt;a href=\"1E%20139\"&gt;1E 139&lt;/a&gt; he ordered a campaign against the remaining &lt;a href=\"Snow%20Elves\"&gt;Snow Elves&lt;/a&gt; in the region near &lt;a href=\"Lake%20Honrich\"&gt;Lake Honrich&lt;/a&gt;.\nTimeline conflicts.\nAccording to the plaque in Windhelm and several other sources, the rule of King Harald is recorded as starting in 1E 143 and lasting for 78 years until his death in &lt;a href=\"1E%20221\"&gt;1E 221&lt;/a&gt;, however the \"\" mentions Skyrim was under his rule in 1E 113, which was also the year of his birth: \"In the 113th year of the First Era, the entirety of modern Skyrim was under the reign of King Harald\". This makes it unclear if Harald was crowned High King at birth in 1E 113 or if the pocket guide is simply incorrect/retconned."}

Unfortunately, the journal is written in some sort of code that need to be deciphered. Our only hope is Enthir, one of Karliah and Gallus' former acquaintances who is a wizard at the College of Winterhold.\"\nWalkthrough.\nFirst, the Dragonborn must speak to Enthir, who can usually be found at &lt;a href=\"The%20Frozen%20Hearth\"&gt;The Frozen Hearth&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Winterhold%20%28Skyrim%20City%29\"&gt;Winterhold&lt;/a&gt; or in the &lt;a href=\"College%20of%20Winterhold%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;College of Winterhold&lt;/a&gt;. After the conversation with him, they must travel to Markarth and speak to Calcelmo at Understone Keep \u2014 he will not grant them access to his research unless persuaded, bribed, intimidated or if they have helped him out by completing the temple quest \"&lt;a href=\"The%20Book%20of%20Love\"&gt;The Book of Love&lt;/a&gt;,\" the Dragonborn has completed the side quest to kill the spider &lt;a href=\"Nimhe\"&gt;Nimhe&lt;/a&gt; in the excavation site, or just simply sold him any piece of &lt;a href=\"Dwemer\"&gt;Dwemer&lt;/a&gt; equipment that he requested. It can also be &lt;a href=\"pickpocket\"&gt;pickpocket&lt;/a&gt;ed from him.\nCalcelmo's Museum.\nOnce the key to Calcelmo's Museum is obtained, head to the North wing of Understone Keep and enter the museum. If Nimhe\u00a0has not been killed, the &lt;a href=\"Hold%20Guard\"&gt;guard&lt;/a&gt; at the door will tell the Dragonborn that they are not allowed to go in, but after the dialogue the guard will allow entrance into the museum. After entering the museum, the guards will not be hostile if Calcelmo's quest is completed, or if he was bribed, intimidated, or persuaded. However, if the &lt;a href=\"Keys%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;key&lt;/a&gt; was obtained by &lt;a href=\"stealing\"&gt;stealing&lt;/a&gt;, the guards will be hostile.\nThe first area contains many common Dwemer artifacts that are directly on display or are in display cases. There are also display cases with &lt;a href=\"Lock%20Level\"&gt;expert&lt;/a&gt; difficulty &lt;a href=\"lock\"&gt;lock&lt;/a&gt;s further into the room that contain &lt;a href=\"Weapons%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;weapons&lt;/a&gt;, and there are a couple of bookcases with adept difficulty locks with &lt;a href=\"Books%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;books&lt;/a&gt;. A &lt;a href=\"Stone%20of%20Barenziah\"&gt;Stone of Barenziah&lt;/a&gt; is in the room behind the gate to the\u00a0left as the Dragonborn enters. In this same room is a &lt;a href=\"Containers%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;chest&lt;/a&gt; with an expert level lock with valuable items.\nCalcelmo's Laboratory.\nAfter getting past the guards, head up to &lt;a href=\"Calcelmo%27s%20Laboratory\"&gt;Calcelmo's Laboratory&lt;/a&gt;, a restricted area protected by Calcelmo's personal mercenaries called Wizard's Guards, who will attack on sight. In the laboratory, in an area to the left, there is a journal and the\u00a0&lt;a href=\"Spider%20Control%20Rod\"&gt;Spider Control Rod&lt;/a&gt;. After a few moments there will be a guard that will walk through the other two doorways, opening them up. These guards can be killed with no bounty, a task that can be aided with &lt;a href=\"Aicantar%27s%20Spider\"&gt;Aicantar's Spider&lt;/a&gt; by using the control rod. The doorway on the left is barred so the right path is the only path available. In order to proceed they must pick the master lock or use Calcelmo's key, making the lock open effortlessly. Two guards will be talking and eventually travel down a hallway. Either follow the guards and sneak by to get to the staircase to the next area, or go to the opposite path and get to the stairway.\nGoing the opposite way of the guards will lead to a hallway filled with a gas that is highly lethal and quickly drains health. Opposite to the hallway there is a button that if stepped on will clear the path, however one needs to run through before the gas fills the room again. An object (such as the nearby Markarth guard's body) can be left on top of the button to remove the gas. There are also gas disabling buttons on the sides of the passage, those may be utilized to get \"safe spots\" for healing. Note that the guards above would probably notice this.\nNote: &lt;a href=\"Potions%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Poison&lt;/a&gt; resistance does not grant immunity to the damage from the gas. However the &lt;a href=\"Argonians%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Argonian&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Histskin\"&gt;Histskin&lt;/a&gt; power can completely negate it. &lt;a href=\"Vampire%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Vampires&lt;/a&gt;, too, are immune to the gas. One can also use &lt;a href=\"Healing\"&gt;Healing&lt;/a&gt; while walking through the gas.\nAlternatively, there is valve on a column near where the two guards walk. Turning the valve activates a spinning blade trap which can be used to kill the guards, while going completely unnoticed (it is on the side of a stone pillar facing away from the patrolling guards a little above a lit lantern). Alongside the mercenaries, the final section will contain Calcelmo's nephew, &lt;a href=\"Aicantar\"&gt;Aicantar&lt;/a&gt; sitting on a chair in front of a table. At the end of the floor is a valve that can be activated. An explosion will happen that will make Aicantar flee and make it possible to pass through and head up to the tower. The explosion can be timed so that the patrolling guard does not die. If guards in the previous room are still alive, they will also run through this room. Continue along through the next couple of doorways to the door leading to the wizard's balcony. In the room before the balcony there is a &lt;a href=\"The%20Litany%20of%20Larceny%23Larceny%20trophies\"&gt;larceny target&lt;/a&gt; called the &lt;a href=\"Dwemer%20Puzzle%20Cube\"&gt;Dwemer Puzzle Cube&lt;/a&gt;, which may be taken to &lt;a href=\"Delvin%20Mallory%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Delvin Mallory&lt;/a&gt; for leveled gold. On another table there is a chest with valuable loot, plus the Enchanting skill book\u00a0\"&lt;a href=\"Twin%20Secrets\"&gt;Twin Secrets&lt;/a&gt;\".\nCalcelmo's Tower.\nIn order to proceed, follow the balcony up and to the right and enter &lt;a href=\"Calcelmo%27s%20Tower\"&gt;Calcelmo's Tower&lt;/a&gt;, and head up to Calcelmo's Stone. To copy Calcelmo's research on Falmer, one needs to get a roll of paper and a charcoal, which are found in abundance if you proceed through the door directly behind the tablet, before activating the stone. There is also a copy of \"&lt;a href=\"Chimarvamidium\"&gt;Chimarvamidium&lt;/a&gt;\" (&lt;a href=\"Heavy%20Armor%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Heavy Armor&lt;/a&gt; skill book) on one of the tables. Once the Dragonborn makes the rubbing, Aicantar, two wizard guards (or three wizards without Aicantar) and &lt;a href=\"Captain%20Aquilius\"&gt;Captain Aquilius&lt;/a&gt; will enter the tower. Aicantar insists that somebody is trying to steal his uncle's research, and demands that the merceneries search the tower from top to bottom. If Aicantar is missing (killed by the Dragonborn) then Captain Aquilius will start dialogue suggesting that he and the other guards are just relaxing and taking a break.\nWith a high enough &lt;a href=\"Magicka%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;magicka&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Illusion%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;illusion&lt;/a&gt;, it is possible for the Dragonborn to neutralize all four hostiles using one or two pacify area spells. Alternatively, it is possible to just sneak past the guards and reach the door to the balcony. Once the guards are dealt with, they can either walk out the door and slide down the waterfall (directly to the right after the stairs) or retrace their steps back to the room previous to the balcony, then take a right (the door to the room needs to be unbarred). This room will lead to the starting chamber of Calcelmo's Laboratory, allowing them to return to the museum. Killing the guards and Calcelmo's nephew seems to only occasionally incur a bounty.\nFrozen Hearth.\nOnce the Dragonborn has left the Understone Keep, the objective marker will automatically update to the Frozen Hearth's cellar in Winterhold. Returning and speaking to Enthir and Karliah at the Frozen Hearth's cellar in Winterhold will complete the quest. As a reward, the Dragonborn will receive the &lt;a href=\"Nightingale%20Blade\"&gt;Nightingale Blade&lt;/a&gt; from Karliah, previously owned by &lt;a href=\"Gallus%20Desidenius\"&gt;Gallus Desidenius&lt;/a&gt;.\nTrivia.\nWizard's Guard: \"Are you serious?\"\nAicantar: \"You heard me. Kill any intruders on sight. We cannot have our work interfered with.\"\nWizard's Guard 1: \"What do you think this is?\"\nWizard's Guard 2: \"Another trap, most likely. Things are dangerous...three guards died when the lower hall flooded with steam last week.\"\nAnd after getting the rubbing, if one set off the trap near Aicantar:\nAicantar: \"Accidents like this just don't happen. Someone is trying to sabotage my uncle's research.\"\nAquilius: \"I...all right. If there is a thief, he won't leave this tower alive. But shouldn't we inform Master Calcelmo?\"\nAicantar: \"I'll deal with my uncle. Just...go! Scour this place from top to bottom!\""}

Mavos's spirit can't remember how he bound Balreth in the original ceremony. To help me, he's going to perform a ritual and show me a vision of the past.\"\nWalkthrough.\nSpeak to &lt;a href=\"Mavos%20Siloreth\"&gt;Mavos Siloreth&lt;/a&gt;, located on the top of the stairway of the biggest tomb in &lt;a href=\"Othrenis\"&gt;Othrenis&lt;/a&gt;. He says that he does not remember how to bind the &lt;a href=\"Balreth\"&gt;Balreth&lt;/a&gt; again, but he will show you a vision of the time he performed the ceremony. For that he will need a skull and a kwama-grease candle.\n\"I knew skeletons weren't enough. I should have summoned Daedra to protect this place. Or a fire atronach. That would have been good.\"\nThe two items needed are locked inside containers on opposite sides of the necropolis. To unlock them you must solve the puzzle for each one of them. The puzzle is fairly simple, to open the chest, the colors on the three interactable pillars on the front must match the colors of the pillars on the back. Activate the pillar to cycle through the three colors, until you get the one that matches the pillar behind. The color for the skull is Yellow-Blue-Yellow, and for the candle Red-Yellow-Blue.\nAfter getting both the items, return to Mavos. As soon as he receives them, he will perform the ritual, sending you to the past.\n\"Ah. You have the skull and candle. You want me to be impressed? You can gather small objects. Good for you. Now stand back while I perform the ritual.\"\nYou will be transported inside the vision, in the &lt;a href=\"Charred%20Ridge\"&gt;Charred Ridge&lt;/a&gt;, an area at the slopes of &lt;a href=\"Ash%20Mountain\"&gt;Ash Mountain&lt;/a&gt;. In the place there are &lt;a href=\"Scamp%20%28Online%29\"&gt;scamps&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Clannfear%20%28Online%29\"&gt;clannfear&lt;/a&gt; roaming, an obstacle for the player. Lying wounded near the portal is an acolyte, &lt;a href=\"Hedyn\"&gt;Hedyn&lt;/a&gt;. He will ask of the &lt;a href=\"Vestige\"&gt;Vestige&lt;/a&gt; to close the Daedric portals that have opened using a pouch that he gives you.\n\"Balreth is too powerful. Portals everywhere. We're doomed. Who are you? Where did you come from?\"\nTo close the portals, simply activate them. After all three are closed, talk to &lt;a href=\"Magister%20Enuse\"&gt;Magister Enuse&lt;/a&gt; further down the area. She will say that in order to bind the Balreth, Mavos needs the help of two &lt;a href=\"Flame%20Atronach%20%28Online%29\"&gt;flame atronachs&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Ragebinder\"&gt;Ragebinder&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Blaze%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Blaze&lt;/a&gt;.\n\"You're not my acolyte. Where did you come from?\"\nActivate the two wells to summon the guardians. The two will head to Mavos to help him out. After they have been positioned, talk to Mavos. He will command you to touch the altar where the Balreth stands in order to complete the ritual.\n\"Excellent. The guardians are here. Time to bind this creature.\"\nActivate the altar. Just as you touch it, a surge of light appears and you are transported back to the present. Talk to Mavos to figure out what to do next.\n\"So that's what happened! I remember many mages dying, and there was something about a shield spell. I grew weak holding him in place. Then there was a bright light. Everything fades after that.\"\nIn order to bind Balreth again, the two guardians that were destroyed the first time must be rebuilt. After he finished talking, the quest is complete and &lt;a href=\"Onuja\"&gt;Onuja&lt;/a&gt; can be seen at the base of the staircase in order to give you the next one, \"&lt;a href=\"To%20Ash%20Mountain\"&gt;To Ash Mountain&lt;/a&gt;.\""}

When the tide shifts, I will be at sea once more, pursuing those dastardly &lt;a href=\"Renrijra%20Maor\"&gt;Renrijra Pirates&lt;/a&gt;.\nPerfidious &lt;a href=\"Khajiit%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Khajiit&lt;/a&gt;! I will pursue those pirates to the world's edge, if need be!\nYou embarrass me with your constant need for declarations of undying love, but rest assured that I echo your sentiments in return.\nLately, I have been preoccupied. The Renrijra raid our shores, trying to claim our lands as their own. I always knew cats were territorial, but those Khajiiti raiders pursue this as an obsession. Those pirates are relentless!\nOn the rare occasions when we capture one, it is always the same frustrating dialogue. They are quick to speak of territorial rights and political reform, and so on and so forth. But really, I know the truth. They are little more than smugglers and sea-raiders propping up their criminal activities behind a facade of ideals. They lie! And they shall pay!\nThey scowl, these pirates. They sneer, even when held in bonds. They take pride in their contemptuous nature. In fact, it is reflected in their very name: \"&lt;a href=\"Renrijra%20Krin\"&gt;Renrijra Krin&lt;/a&gt;.\" I have heard it translated as \"the Mercenary's Grin\" or \"the Smiling Scum.\" The scum! It suits them well, but I prefer to call a knave a knave. They are smugglers and pirates and thieves to the last filthy cat.\nThe Renrijra are swaggering fools. Do you know what the so-called \"code\" of their order is called? \"The Foolish Concepts.\" Fools! I have intercepted their logs and records, and I know their ways. They kill without hesitation. They espouse bravery, yet run away when confronted with justice. They curry favor by giving trinkets to the poor. Then they claim to be benefactors when stealing from those of privilege. A thief is still a thief!\nSuch insolence! They remind me of that servant we used to employ, the one who deigned to teach you how to dance. Do you remember him? The swarthy fellow who kept trying to meet with you privately? What cheek! Or the gardener who lurked by your bedroom window while I was away? Or the mason who would linger in our salon pretending to work while surreptitiously staring at you? Knaves! The world is full of knaves.\nKnow that I do this for more than my need to protect you and yours. I do this to protect our kingdom! I do this to secure our &lt;a href=\"High%20King%20Emeric%20%28Online%29\"&gt;High King's&lt;/a&gt; domain by sea! Those knavish cats will never prevail.\nForgive me for my digression. My need for justice consumes me. I fear I will be at sea pursuing the Renrijra for several more months, along with the crew of the Wrath of &lt;a href=\"Glenumbra%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Glenumbra&lt;/a&gt;, yet I await the day I shall return to you.\nIn answer to your last query: yes, we can afford to hire those workers you requested to build an extension on the house. Make sure they aren't shirking their duties. You'll have to watch them closely!\nI've nearly drained my teapot and worn out my welcome with these spiritual lizard-folk, so I must be away. Rest assured, those Renrijra Pirates won't escape the relentless efforts of the Breton Navy.\nI remain, as always, your affectionate and loving,\n\u2014Captain Augustus Relippe, Commander, &lt;a href=\"The%20Wrath%20of%20Glenumbra\"&gt;The Wrath of Glenumbra&lt;/a&gt;"}

Being overcome by sickness, he is bedridden and dying.\nA few days after completing the quests \"&lt;a href=\"The%20White%20Phial%20%28Quest%29\"&gt;The White Phial&lt;/a&gt;\" and \"&lt;a href=\"The%20Throat%20of%20the%20World\"&gt;The Throat of the World&lt;/a&gt;,\" a courier will deliver a letter from Nurelion's assistant, Quintus Navale. The letter explains that his master is still alive and Quintus asks the Dragonborn to come and talk about the possibility of repairing the Phial. Upon repairing the phial, he gives it to the Dragonborn as a reward.\nIn order to repair the Phial, Quintus asks for three ingredients to be found:\nOnce all three have been obtained, the\u00a0Dragonborn\u00a0can return to Quintus Navale and watch him repair the Phial. When complete, he takes the Phial upstairs to show it to his dying master, Nurelion. Upon seeing the Phial whole again, Nurelion remarks, \"Marvelous...\" and soon after perishes. Quintus comments that his master died happy, realizing his life's work was not in vain. Quintus, however, cannot stand to have the Phial around anymore because it reminds him of Nurelion's obsession. Instead, he gives it to the Dragonborn. However, since he is not as skilled as &lt;a href=\"Curalmil\"&gt;Curalmil&lt;/a&gt;, its creator, the Phial will only regenerate a single kind of magical liquid. What it will produce can be chosen based upon how Quintus is responded to:\nAfter drinking from the Phial it will be listed as \"\"(Empty)\" and the item will appear in inventory as a special Miscellaneous item and will not disappear. This allows multiple \"White Phial (Empty)'s\"\" in inventory at one time. These weigh 0.5 each and can be dropped. After 24 hours the liquid inside the Phial will regenerate and the potion will be drinkable again."}

She was supposed to obtain a sacrifice for her mother to perform an evil ritual, but rebelled. Illia wants me to help her get to the top of the tower so she can stop her mother.\"\nWalkthrough.\nThe quest begins upon entering Darklight Tower. The Dragonborn will be approached by an &lt;a href=\"Imperials%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Imperial&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Mage%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Mage&lt;/a&gt;, Illia, who has just killed a fellow witch. She says that the tower is evil and she can no longer be a part of its dark order. She asks the Dragonborn to help her travel to the top and kill the leader of the order, her mother Silvia. Accept, and she will set off up the stairs.\nIllia is a powerful ally, and casts strong ice spikes that deal heavy damage to the many &lt;a href=\"Frostbite%20Spider%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;spiders&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Hagraven%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Hagravens&lt;/a&gt; that inhabit the dungeon. Stay in range and back her up to avoid most of the damage.\nAt some point the Dragonborn will reach a master level locked door. If the Dragonborn cannot pick the lock, they will need to venture alone down a side hallway into an inner chamber, where they will be confronted by a witch and a Hagraven. The witch also has the key, and will need to be defeated before returning to Illia. Unlock the door with the key and continue until the top of the tower is reached.\nUpon exiting the tower onto the courtyard, Illia will tell the Dragonborn her plan to deceive Silvia into thinking they are her sacrifice. The event begins when the Dragonborn sits in the chair. The Dragonborn need not remain seated and may find it advantageous to immediately stand and unsheath before combat begins. Illia will attempt to backstab her mother but will fail, so the Dragonborn will have to quickly overwhelm and help defeat the witch. She has powerful spells, but will focus on her daughter before she targets the Dragonborn. However, the plan can be ignored and Silvia can be immediately killed.\nWhen she is dead, Illia will thank the Dragonborn and suggest taking her mother's staff, the &lt;a href=\"Staff%20of%20Hag%27s%20Wrath\"&gt;Staff of Hag's Wrath&lt;/a&gt;, as payment. Loot the staff, as well as anything of value from the table. Be sure to check the chest in her tent for further reward."}

Its government is not recognized by any under &lt;a href=\"Septim%20Empire\"&gt;Imperial&lt;/a&gt; authority. As its people, also called &lt;a href=\"Hahd\"&gt;Hahd&lt;/a&gt;, have made no trouble whatsoever for anyone in history (save once), this same government has never been contested, either. That Hahd is documented here at all is because of the singular time the Republic had an effect on &lt;a href=\"Tamriel\"&gt;Tamriel&lt;/a&gt;ic affairs (which also marks the first time any of the known peoples had heard of it), and by some kind and enabling words of a mapmaker.\nIn the early &lt;a href=\"third%20era\"&gt;third era&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"Altmer\"&gt;Altmer&lt;/a&gt;i Keepers of the &lt;a href=\"Great%20Orrery\"&gt;Orrery of Firsthold&lt;/a&gt; suddenly paid tariffs to the &lt;a href=\"Septim%20Empire\"&gt;Empire&lt;/a&gt; on behalf of the Republic of Hahd for \"submersible exports of &lt;a href=\"mnemolichite\"&gt;mnemolichite&lt;/a&gt; to the Emirates of &lt;a href=\"Nahd\"&gt;Nahd&lt;/a&gt;\". While the &lt;a href=\"Septim%20Dynasty\"&gt;Septim&lt;/a&gt; Regime was glad to receive the not un-trivial amount of the tariff expense, it did demand to know three things: one, what and where was Hahd, two, what exactly was mnemolichite, and three, what and where was Nahd.\nWhen the Altmer had no answers to any of this, the &lt;a href=\"Ruby%20Throne\"&gt;Ruby Throne&lt;/a&gt; grew suspicious and mustered its Armada to make sail. An offended &lt;a href=\"Alinor\"&gt;Alinor&lt;/a&gt; responded by withdrawing all of its &lt;a href=\"Sun%20Birds\"&gt;sunbirds&lt;/a&gt; from the &lt;a href=\"Pyandonea\"&gt;Pyandonea&lt;/a&gt;n line to meet the Empire. Just before emissaries from both sides of the imminent battle were about to give up disentangling the mounting myriad of accusations, a book from Hahd arrived by an undisclosed courier to \"explain everything whereby these hostilities may cease.\"\nThis book was studied by a joint committee of Altmeri and &lt;a href=\"Imperial\"&gt;Cyrodilic&lt;/a&gt; officials and watched over by an impartial &lt;a href=\"Psijic%20Order\"&gt;Psijiic&lt;/a&gt; of the recently-returned &lt;a href=\"Artaeum\"&gt;Artaeum&lt;/a&gt;. It described the Republic in little detail, only enough to give its supposed location far below the waters of &lt;a href=\"Dellesia\"&gt;Dellesia&lt;/a&gt;. The committee agreed that such a habitat as depicted in the book was impossible (for one, the Hahd described themselves as air-breathers that never needed to break the surface of the sea). This unlikelihood was eventually cemented as an outright falsehood by civilized &lt;a href=\"dreugh\"&gt;dreugh&lt;/a&gt;s living near that region. They had never heard of the Republic of Hahd, and no intellectual of Tamriel ever argued with the cepholomer at that time.\nOn the separate cases of the Emirates of Nahd and the mineral called mnemolichite, the Republic's explanations for both were the same: they were figments of imagination, a kingdom and a treasure made popular in the Republic by their recurrence in its many fables, underwater campfire stories, and stageplays.\n\"We are not a very creative folk,\" the Hahd admitted, \"But we always enjoy hearing about the fantastical heroes of sandy Nahd and the wondrous powers of mnemolichite because of the delight that their impossibilities bring to our hearts.\"\nObviously, what the book failed to properly explain was the impetus for the payment of &lt;a href=\"Firsthold\"&gt;Firsthold&lt;/a&gt; tariffs in the first place. After a fifty-year study of the book and its Republic, the committee went back to analyzing the only thing that might shed light on this matter: the financial logs of Firsthold and those payments sent from the Orrery Keepers to the Imperial Treasury. By this time, however, both the pertinent parties\u2014 the Altmeri paymaster and the Cyrodilic Clerk of Tithes Submersible\u2014 had long since been replaced, leaving only their records of the by-now bewildering transactions behind. Another fifty-year investigation of these materials ensued. In the end, unraveling anything more about the Republic of Hahd and its mysterious manipulation of Firsthold was deemed futile by both &lt;a href=\"Cyrodiil\"&gt;Cyrodiil&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Summerset%20Isles\"&gt;Summerset&lt;/a&gt;; the surviving members of the joint committee were finally dismissed and sent home in &lt;a href=\"3E%20230\"&gt;3E230&lt;/a&gt;.\nThat same year, the Isle of Artaeum disappeared again. Reluctant rescue operations in and about the &lt;a href=\"Blue%20Divide\"&gt;Blue Divide&lt;/a&gt; discovered no survivors of this new version of the phenomenon and no signs of misdeed mundane or magical; all agreed that the Psijics were up to their own tricks again, and the advent of the &lt;a href=\"Mages%20Guild\"&gt;Mages Guild&lt;/a&gt; made this an unworthy endeavor to pursue further. A few days later, however, sailors aboard the NWN frigate &lt;a href=\"Colleen\"&gt;Colleen&lt;/a&gt;, on its way back to the &lt;a href=\"Illiac%20Bay\"&gt;Iliac&lt;/a&gt; to put down more &lt;a href=\"Haymonic\"&gt;Haymonic&lt;/a&gt; insurgency, discovered a book in its dragging nets. It was entitled, \"The Dervish of Dellesia and the Mnemolichite Maid.\" Quite by chance, the captain of the Colleen, &lt;a href=\"Davidius%20Eel\"&gt;Davidius Eel&lt;/a&gt;, was a great-nephew of one of the members of the joint committee that had obsessed over the Republic of Hahd for a hundred years.\nCaptain Eel began to read the manuscript immediately, if only out of a blood-guilt to restore the unsatisfied honor of his ancestor. He was only a few paragraphs in when he realized, to his astonishment, the book's true nature. It was not, as its title might suggest, a fable about Nahd from the denizens of Hahd, but rather a fable about Hahd from some unknown writer of Nahd. The eponymous dervish was some kind of \"air-breathing sea-soldier, formerly of the Republican Guard\", who was either protecting or wooing \"that maiden to first hold the star-minerals of heaven\". Perhaps most troubling was the author (\"a humble Nahd of Nahd\") and his nearly rote-written preface, which clearly, if uncreatively, indicated that the book was part of a large series or maybe even a shared universe, whose twin anchor points were always the same: an obsession with Hahd and the \"powers\" of mnemolichite. The latter was never adequately explained in the manuscript, nor has it ever been.\nIt is the belief of this Survey Agent that any description of the true nature of mnemolichite was as unneeded for the story's intended audience as an explanation of the sun's true nature would be for a citizen of Tamriel. It was also the belief of this Survey Agent that the regions of Hahd and Nahd not be written of here at all, since no real answers of their disparate (?) peoples, lands, or cultural make will likely surface, and that that futility is not befitting of our society. It is to my great friend and colleague, Senior Cartographer &lt;a href=\"Rinmaut\"&gt;Rinmaut&lt;/a&gt;, that I dedicate this lengthy passage to him and his words of convincing, \"Those places that cannot be mapped, they should never cry avast to our pens to stop and try.\""}

Darius tasks the Nerevarine with her rescue.\nIt is likely that the kidnapping is related to the Ashlanders's custom of taking away villagers to us them as slaves. Like other Dunmers, the Ashlander practice slavery, but unlike their cousins, they consider Khajiit and Argonians unfit for slave labor. So instead, they use exponents of other races for their purpose.\nDetailed Walkthrough.\nAfter the Nerevarine has finished the Imperial Legion quest \"&lt;a href=\"Gnisis%20Eggmine%20%28Quest%29\"&gt;Gnisis Eggmine&lt;/a&gt;,\" chatting with General Darius about \"orders\" will start the quest. He tells the Nerevarine about reports of a kidnapped pilgrim named Madura Seran. A group of outcast &lt;a href=\"Ashlanders%20%28Morrowind%29\"&gt;Ashlanders&lt;/a&gt; are suspected to be responsible. If the Nerevarine decides to visit Ald Velothi before saving the pilgrim, the villagers are worried about the kidnapping and hope for someone to put a stop to this activities. Madura Seran is held captive at Aidanat Camp. When spoken to about Madura Seran, the two Ashlanders outside the only tent direct the Nerevarine inside to Abassel Asserbassalit Here, the Nerevarine has a choice. He can either free Madura Seran without the consent of Abassel Asserbassalit, thus provoking him and his clan members to attack. If the Nerevarine chooses to fight, Madura Seran will assist him. Alternatively, he can raise Abassel Asserbassalit's disposition until he is willing to let the pilgrim go for a ransom of 500 . Either way, the Nerevarine must then escort Madura Seran back to Ald Velothi Outpost. Once savely back there, Madura Seran leaves the Nerevarine's company and he is free to return to General Darius and report his success."}

She says their lair is near &lt;a href=\"Ghast%27s%20Pass\"&gt;Ghast's Pass&lt;/a&gt;.\nTo find the hideout, the Hero must cross the bridge over the river, where they will meet &lt;a href=\"Old%20Trinket\"&gt;Old Trinket&lt;/a&gt;. He will tell the Hero he saw rats heading west, and by following them they will find they head off the road to &lt;a href=\"Delfran%27s%20Hideout\"&gt;Delfran's Hideout&lt;/a&gt;.\nOnce inside, it is necessary to obtain the keys to the cells that the villagers are being held prisoners in. This can be done by speaking to the &lt;a href=\"Chel\"&gt;Chel&lt;/a&gt;, who is partially blind and assumes the Hero is a bandit. He gives the key to the cells and some food, asking them to feed the prisoners. The Hero can now release the prisoners.\nAfter clearing the cells, the Hero can head to the infirmary, where they will release more prisoners. This will direct them to the training rooms, where another prisoner is held. Continuing on to the interrogation room, the Hero will find another prisoner as well as an &lt;a href=\"Orc\"&gt;Orc&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Makor\"&gt;Makor&lt;/a&gt;, who says he will repay them someday for freeing him.\nUpon reaching the center of the hideout, the Hero will find the throne room to be locked behind two doors. They must first kill &lt;a href=\"Lieutenant%20Jolias\"&gt;Lieutenant Jolias&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Lieutenant%20Breser\"&gt;Lieutenant Breser&lt;/a&gt;, who both wander nearby, and take their keys to open the respective doors. Going to the throne room, the Hero will find &lt;a href=\"Delfran\"&gt;Delfran&lt;/a&gt; himself along with some of his guards. After killing them, the first &lt;a href=\"Shadowkeys\"&gt;Shadowkey&lt;/a&gt; is looted from his body, and the Hero meets two other prisoners, &lt;a href=\"Birgitta\"&gt;Birgitta&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Skelos%20Undriel\"&gt;Skelos Undriel&lt;/a&gt;.

Inside, they can find Ragash gra-Shuzgub imprisoned in a cell on the lower floor. They have several options to free her: They can either attempt to &lt;a href=\"Lockpick%20%28Morrowind%29\"&gt;pick the lock&lt;/a&gt; of the celldoor. This might prove difficult however, as the lock is level 65 and is trapped. Another way is to confront Baladas himself. To reach him, the Nerevarine must open another locked door, but there is a key on a ground level room to the right of the entrance. When spoken to about \"Ragash gra-Shuzgub,\" Baladas appears insulted by the idea of paying tribute \"for the Empire of men,\" as he was there before them and will also outlive their Empire. By raising his disposition and chosing the right dialogue options, telling him that Ragash gra-Shuzgub has learnt her lesson, the Nerevarine can obtain the key to free the &lt;a href=\"Orsimer%20%28Morrowind%29\"&gt;Orsimer&lt;/a&gt;. A last option for cutpurses would be to pickpocket the key from Baladas.\nWhen entering the cell, a dialogue with Ragash begins. She asks the Nerevarine to free her. The Nerevarine must escort her safely out of Arvs-Drelen, where she will thank them. To finish the mission, the Nerevarine should now return to Darius."}

The &lt;a href=\"Nerevarine\"&gt;Nerevarine&lt;/a&gt; must rescue Varvur to gain the support of Athyn Sarethi in order to be named as &lt;a href=\"Hortator\"&gt;Hortator&lt;/a&gt; of the House of Redoran.

He will tell the Nerevarine that his son, Varvur, has been imprisoned within the &lt;a href=\"Venim%20Manor\"&gt;Venim Manor&lt;/a&gt; on suspicion of murder.

The Manor itself is heavily guarded, particularly when the Nerevarine gets closer to Varvur's hidden room. The Nerevarine must obtain a key to the door behind which Varvur is held, although the door itself is hidden within the Right Wing of the Manor. The Nerevarine can find the key, as well as a &lt;a href=\"Note%20to%20Malsa%20Ules\"&gt;note&lt;/a&gt; to &lt;a href=\"Malsa%20Ules\"&gt;Malsa Ules&lt;/a&gt; (which tells the Nerevarine that the door is hidden behind a tapestry) on a bench in the Right Wing (if the Nerevarine is witnessed picking up the note or key the guards will attack without hesitation).\nHaving found the door behind a tapestry the Nerevarine must tell Varvur that they are there to rescue him. Varvur will then accompany the Nerevarine through the Venim Manor.\nHaving escorted Varvur through the Venim Manor, the Nerevarine and Varvur are free to return to Sarethi Manor.\nAthyn Sarethi's Reward.\nAthyn Sarethi will be greatly pleased by the Nerevarine's return with his son Varvur.

Then go back inside and tell the freed prisoners to follow and exit to the courtyard and begin the fight (the prisoners will help in the fight). If the fort was not visited previously, three Stormcloak guards will be in the prison, two patrolling, and one sitting down at the table above the cells. Each one carries a key to the cells that can be taken via pickpocket or looted from their corpses. If they are spared, once the prisoners are freed and change back into their armor, the Stormcloaks will become hostile and attack. Kill them before they kill the prisoners, then exit the fort to deal with the rest of the garrison outside in the courtyard.\nWhen done fighting all of the Stormcloaks, talk to Hadvar once more. After discussing the aftermath of the battle, and whether any of the prisoners of war or his own troops survived, he will give orders to report back to &lt;a href=\"General%20Tullius%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;General Tullius&lt;/a&gt; while he sets up a garrison.

The entrance into the prison is at the base of the wall by a sunken boat. A novice locked chest is under the boat. The entrance is straight ahead from the chest and an adept locked chest is sunken at the cavern's eastern wall.\nFreeing the prisoners.\nAn Imperial guard will be sitting at a desk with his back to the prisoners. The key to the cells is on his person and on top of the chest next to him as well. Kill or sneak past the guard and release the prisoners. They will suit up in armor and can either be told to stay behind or to follow.\nTaking the fort.\nCut through the opposition and lead the men up to the courtyard as instructed. There Ralof and his men will arrive to finish off the exterior garrison. Ralof will explain that there are likely more men in the fort that need to be dealt with. Sweep the fort of all remaining men and kill the garrison commander in his quarters to complete the fort's sacking.\nConclusion.\nWith the fort captured, Ralof will need word sent back to Ulfric of their success. Upon returning to Windhelm, Ulfric indicates that Falkreath has now been liberated and bestows the title of Bone-Breaker.

The fact that they almost killed those &lt;a href=\"Khajiit%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Khajiit&lt;/a&gt; brothers in the middle of the night doesn't mean we couldn't have found a way to disable one. We dragged some stuff in front of the pipes they came out of to stop them from coming back.\nThey are simply fascinating! It is just as &lt;a href=\"Calcelmo\"&gt;Calcelmo&lt;/a&gt; described in &lt;a href=\"Dwarves%2C%20v2\"&gt;Dwarves, v2&lt;/a&gt;. Their appearance does, in fact, resemble that of an arachnid. I had thought that to be an embellishment given by his source. The inclusion of the &lt;a href=\"Soul%20Gem%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;soul gem&lt;/a&gt; into the design of the apparatus is quite remarkable. It could explain the focus for the lightning that he describes.\nOddly enough it doesn't appear to be the main power source for the apparatus. Perhaps some sort of harmonic resonance with the energies contained in the soul gem to bring heat to a small boiler? Too early to say conclusively. That does raise the question of where they get the liquid for the boiler however.\nHuh, that was strange. I thought I just saw something moving beyond the barred door. It looked vaguely humanoid. I wonder if it could be an undiscovered automaton? I'm going to move my bedroll down here to see if I can catch another\nglimpse of it. This is all so exciting!"}

For a more comfortable reading, they have been replaced with {...}.\nResearch Papers.\nThe manner by which the diastolic pressure of any two scarce commodities (creating a type of propulsion with no moving parts and virtual silence) has been postulated by thyrionic mathematicians for many years. In conventional thinking, the default parameters of any formula (objectively speaking, it is essential to remember that objectivity is indeed subjective) will always return to what &lt;a href=\"Mornthaur\"&gt;Mornthaur&lt;/a&gt; called the \"back medium.\" However, starting with a grid of complex numbers that more than covers the unit circle and three cube roots of one, we\ncan backtrace, by uptracking the negative \"half numbers,\" and create an infinite basin with dual natures of blackness and whiteness. The rate of adiabatic cooling or warming inunsaturated air can thus be made directly proportional to the fourth power of its absolute temperature.\nWhen white light is passed through a gas under a medium dense gas at a high temperature, a dynamic thermal instability occurs. Since magicka is usually a very faint source of illumination, gases, under much greater pressure, are forced to combine with degenerated matter, creating dual forces, beyond and beneath. The end result is a quasi-horizontal chonolith composed of an astomosing ductoliths, whose distal ends curl like a harpolith, thin like a sphenolith, or bulge discordantly like an akmolith or ethmolith. There are thus five\nelements that must be contributed towards a universal confederation of what &lt;a href=\"Vanus%20Galerion\"&gt;Vanus Galerion&lt;/a&gt; called \"gray matter\" -- perception, evidence, essence, morality, and extraction.\nTrivia.\nThe above papers are described as \"parchments\" in game and are untitled."}

Yes, these colder conditions are positively wondrous for my mixtures. And there's no nasty guards to question us. No eyes that look upon &lt;a href=\"Disease\"&gt;our blessing&lt;/a&gt; with ignorant distaste. Many questioned my decision, but oh, they simply saw what was ahead. Not beyond, not as I do. \nMy research with the &lt;a href=\"Ogre%20%28Online%29\"&gt;ogres&lt;/a&gt; in the caverns has produced \u2026 admittedly mixed results. They were easy enough to infect. Predictable patterns and slow wits make for lovely test subjects. We saw early signs of the physical manifestations of the disease, yes, oh yes. Lovely, absolutely lovely. These disgusting creatures became beautiful under my guidance. Oh, how lucky they were, to be the first embraced by such a loving illness. \nBut then it turned all wrong! They turned out all wrong, all wrong! The way they've begun to act, you wouldn't even think they were sick. Nasty, stupid creatures won't even die! They just became \u2026 angry. Stronger. Downright mean! They started attacking my researchers. I'm afraid we lost quite a few just last night. Hopefully we can still remain on schedule, but I can see quite a delay already. \nThough it pains me to leave such research behind, I simply must conclude that these ogres are too beast like. We'll need more human subjects if we wish to continue our research. We simply have no time for our usual procedures, given how isolated this mountain is. Many have proposed the giants may prove to be useful. Dangerous, dangerous, but what is discovery without a few deaths? \nOn a personal note, my other ear has finally rotted off. There's still a bit more to go, but the current state shows promise. Everyday I become more beautiful, more perfect. More blessed."}

Our lovely &lt;a href=\"Disease\"&gt;plague&lt;/a&gt; has come together nicely, so nicely. Yes, I dare say at this point it's nigh incurable! We had some initial troubles with creating a delay in symptoms. Burn out the subject too quickly, and, well, there's no time for it to spread. No, we want to keep them up and about, spreading our blessing to as many as possible. How \u2026 reverent. \nAnd when the symptoms do come, oh, well\u2014it goes beyond description. I could wax poetic about the succulent pus, those all-spreading rashes. Boils, nearly translucent, they become so overfilled. The mere sight of that lovely, sickening shade of green sends pleasant shivers throughout my body. Have you ever seen something so beautiful? I've always had pride in my work, but this borders on adoration. \nThe &lt;a href=\"Giants%20%28Online%29\"&gt;giants&lt;/a&gt; have proved useful, just as the &lt;a href=\"Ogre%20%28Online%29\"&gt;ogres&lt;/a&gt;, but still their reaction is just \u2026 wrong! They've turned my poor creation into something different, something unexpected. The heathens! Just like the ogres, it's turned them stronger, even more aggressive. They simply aren't human enough. Not right! The majority of them should be dead by now, but here they are, sturdier than ever. It makes me sick, and not in the good way! \nWe've lost a handful of researchers already, and I simply can't afford to lose more. The giant's &lt;a href=\"Matriarch%20Aldis\"&gt;matriarch&lt;/a&gt; has become particularly aggressive. And she just started to look so lovely, too. What a shame. I had hoped to sketch her in my spare time. Well, the path to discovery always tends to be tricky terrain. A few deaths are just unavoidable if we ever hope to reach our goal. \nSpeaking of our goal \u2026 oh, yes, yes, yes! She's begun to wake up. I feel it in my bones. Such a &lt;a href=\"Zaan%20the%20Scalecaller\"&gt;sleepy head&lt;/a&gt;, that one is. I hear her though. Oh, I hear her! She whispers to me of our glorious plans, how we will usher in a new age. I know we will. We must keep her safe, for the time being. And then she will become the shepherd. \nI'm hoping to look my best when we finally meet. My nose has begun to rot, but the progress is slow. I'm half tempted to chop it off myself! But no. No, no, it would just look all wrong. I must be patient, in all things.

He knows I have been loyal. Faithful. I see the vision of his ordered world, and I revel in it. A land filled with corpses, rotting, resplendent. A new age shall come, a new order will come! All under my Lord's banner. Mother will regret the day she spurned me. \nI wish to keep recording, of course, but it's getting a bit trickier to write since my third finger fell off.

In Morrowind, this effect is available in the form of &lt;a href=\"Abilities%20%28Morrowind%29\"&gt;abilities&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Spells%20%28Morrowind%29\"&gt;spells&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Potions%20%28Morrowind%29\"&gt;potions&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Enchant%20%28Morrowind%29\"&gt;enchantments&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe Resist effect has the usual Range (Self, Other, etc.), and the usual Duration, but the operation of the Magnitude varies. In the case of resistance to elemental damage, the magnitude is a percentage of the damage that is prevented. In the case of Disease and other such effects, which are either on or off, then as with &lt;a href=\"Reflect%20%28Morrowind%29\"&gt;Reflect&lt;/a&gt; and some other spells, the magnitude is an alteration to the percentage chance that the player will be affected at all. Resist Magicka allows the player to be protected against any type of magical effects, including Blind; when it is protecting against elemental damage, it works the way the elemental resists work, and when it is preventing on/off effects, it works as a modification of probability.\nWhen an item is &lt;a href=\"Enchant%20%28Morrowind%29\"&gt;Enchanted&lt;/a&gt; with a continuous Resist effect, but the Magnitude is variable, the probability is determined when the item is equipped. It will remain at that value for as long as the item is equipped. So if an item has a Resist Magicka Magnitude of 1\u2013100, it might provide 67% when equipped, or 33%, or 1%, or 100%. Thus a player can substitute additional time taken to re-equip an item, for the cost (and time to acquire money) of a magnitude that would normally require multiple enchantments."}

{"id": "11102", "revid": "32045548", "url": "https://elderscrolls.fandom.com/wiki?curid=11102", "title": "Response to Bero's Speech", "text": "Response to Bero's Speech is a &lt;a href=\"book\"&gt;book&lt;/a&gt; in , , and .\nContents.\nOn the 14th of &lt;a href=\"Last%20Seed\"&gt;Last Seed&lt;/a&gt;, an illusionist by the name of Berevar Bero gave a very ignorant speech at the Chantry of &lt;a href=\"Julianos\"&gt;Julianos&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;a href=\"Imperial%20City\"&gt;Imperial City&lt;/a&gt;. As ignorant speeches are hardly uncommon, there was no reason to respond to it. Unfortunately, he has since had the speech privately printed as \"Bero's Speech to the Battlemages,\" and it's received some small, undeserved attention in academic circles. Let us put his misconceptions to rest.\nBero began his lecture with an occasionally factual account of famous Battlemages from &lt;a href=\"Zurin%20Arctus\"&gt;Zurin Arctus&lt;/a&gt;, Tiber Septim's &lt;a href=\"Imperial%20Battlemage\"&gt;Imperial Battlemage&lt;/a&gt;, to &lt;a href=\"Jagar%20Tharn\"&gt;Jagar Tharn&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Uriel%20Septim%20VII\"&gt;Uriel Septim VII&lt;/a&gt;'s Imperial Battlemage. His intent was to show that where it matters, the Battlemage relies on other &lt;a href=\"Schools%20of%20Magicka\"&gt;Schools of Magicka&lt;/a&gt;, not the School of &lt;a href=\"Destruction\"&gt;Destruction&lt;/a&gt; which is supposedly a Battlemage's particular forte. Allow me first to dispute these so-called historical facts.\nZurin Arctus did not create the golem &lt;a href=\"Numidium\"&gt;Numidium&lt;/a&gt; by spells of &lt;a href=\"Mysticism\"&gt;Mysticism&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Conjuration\"&gt;Conjuration&lt;/a&gt; as Bero alleges. The truth is that we don't know how Numidium was created or if it was a golem or atronach in any traditional sense of those words. &lt;a href=\"Uriel%20V\"&gt;Uriel V&lt;/a&gt;'s Battlemage Hethoth was not an Imperial Battlemage\u2014he was simply a sorcerer in the employ of the Empire, thus which spells he cast in the various battles on &lt;a href=\"Akavir\"&gt;Akavir&lt;/a&gt; are irrelevant, not to mention heresay. Bero calls Empress &lt;a href=\"Morihatha%20Septim\"&gt;Morihatha&lt;/a&gt;'s Battlemage Welloc \"an accomplished diplomat\" but not \"a powerful student of the School of Destruction.\" I congratulate Bero on correctly identifying an Imperial Battlemage, but there are many written examples of Welloc's skill in the School of Destruction. The sage &lt;a href=\"Loremaster%20Celarus\"&gt;Celarus&lt;/a&gt;, for example, wrote extensively about Welloc casting the Vampiric Cloud on the rebellious army of &lt;a href=\"Blackrose\"&gt;Blackrose&lt;/a&gt;, causing their strength and skill to pass on to their opponents. What is this, but an impressive example of the School of Destruction?\nBero rather pathetically includes Jagar Tharn in his list of underachieving Battlemages. To use an insane traitor as example of rational behavior is an untenable position. What would Bero prefer? That Tharn used the School of Destruction to destroy Tamriel by a more traditional means?\nBero uses his misrepresentation of history as the basis for his argument. Even if he had found four excellent examples from history of Battlemages casting spells outside their School\u2014and he didn't -- he would only have anecdotal evidence, which isn't enough to support an argument. I could easily find four examples of illusionists casting healing spells, or &lt;a href=\"nightblade\"&gt;nightblade&lt;/a&gt;s teleporting. There is a time and a place for everything.\nBero's argument, built on this shaky ground, is that the School of Destruction is not a true school. He calls it \"narrow and shallow\" as an avenue of study, and its students impatient, with megalomaniac tendencies. How can one respond to this? Someone who knows nothing about casting a spell of Destruction criticizing the School for being too simple? Summarizing the School of Destruction as learning how to do the \"maximum amount of damage in the minimum amount of time\" is clearly absurd, and he expounds on his ignorance by listing all the complicated factors studied in his own School of Illusion.\nAllow me in response to list the factors studied in the School of Destruction. The means of delivering the spell matters more in the School of Destruction than any other school, whether it is cast at a touch, at a range, in concentric circles, or cast once to be triggered later. What forces must be reigned in to cast the spell: fire, lightning, or frost? And what are the advantages and dangers of each? What are the responses from different targets from the assault of different spells of destruction? What are the possible defenses and how may they be assailed? What environmental factors must be taken into consideration? What are the advantages of a spell of delayed damage? Bero suggests that the School of Destruction cannot be subtle, yet he forgets about all the Curses that fall under the mantle of the school, sometimes affecting generation after generation in subtle yet sublime ways.\nThe School of &lt;a href=\"Alteration\"&gt;Alteration&lt;/a&gt; is a distinct and separate entity from the School of Destruction, and Bero's argument that they should be merged into one is patently ludicrous. He insists\u2014again, a man who knows nothing about the Schools of Alteration and Destruction, is the one insisting this\u2014that \"damage\" is part of the changing of reality dealt with by the spells of Alteration. The implication is that &lt;a href=\"Levitation\"&gt;Levitation&lt;/a&gt;, to list a spell of Alteration, is a close cousin of Shock Bolt, a spell of Destruction. It would make as much sense to say that the School of Alteration, being all about the actuality of change, should absorb the School of &lt;a href=\"Illusion\"&gt;Illusion&lt;/a&gt;, being all about the appearance of change.\nIt certainly isn't a coincidence that a master of the School of Illusion cast this attack on the School of Destruction. Illusion is, after all, all about masking the truth."}

In general, after enemies in a building are defeated, their resting places are not marked as owned; an exception is &lt;a href=\"Calixto%27s%20House%20of%20Curiosities\"&gt;Calixto's House of Curiosities&lt;/a&gt;, as the items and bed will still be considered owned by him and resting is not possible.

The four smugglers, Dudley, Larisus Dergius, Ralos Othrenim and Thervam Drelas, are hiding out in Yasams,i the road south of town. Ralos Othrenim is the one who has Julielle Aumine's amulet.

She gave him a tour of Wayrest and its' Breton cuisine, and then had him meet with &lt;a href=\"High%20King%20Emeric%20%28Online%29\"&gt;King Emeric&lt;/a&gt; in Wayrest Castle. Frey described them to have gotten along smashingly, as they found to have shared similar opinions on politics and warfare, and took great pleasure in making each other laugh. At the end of the evening, Kurog admitted he was returning to Wrothgar to take control of his clan, but decided he would try and rebuild &lt;a href=\"Yashnag%20gro-Yazgu\"&gt;Yashnag gro-Yazgu&lt;/a&gt;'s kingdom in &lt;a href=\"Falkreath\"&gt;Falkreath&lt;/a&gt; before turning to High Rock. Kurog and Emeric then shook hands, and the latter suggested that Kurog take Zephrine Frey with him to Wrothgar. Kurog, admitting to Emeric that he knew Frey was a spy, agreed anyways as he found her amusing.\nDuring the trip to Wrothgar, Kurog spoke about his dream to have the Orcish people change their oppressive and restrictive traditions, build large cosmopolitan cities of learning, and introduce new cuisine. Soon after crossing the border into Wrothgar, Kurog entered his childhood stronghold, where &lt;a href=\"Chief%20Bolazgar\"&gt;Chief Bolazgar&lt;/a&gt; was waiting for him with four honor guards. Bolazgar asked Kurog if he'd come to grovel and beg for his forgiveness. Kurog instead said he'd come to challenge the chief for his leadership of &lt;a href=\"Clan%20Bagrakh\"&gt;Clan Bagrakh&lt;/a&gt;. Bolazgar, shaking with rage, questioned Kurog if he truly believed he could beat him in fair combat. Kurog taunted the chief saying that he'd grown fat in weak in his time away, and that he'd instead been fighting wars in distant lands. Enraged by Kurog's remarks, Bolazgar charged at him with a scream of pure rage. Kurog stood his ground and calmly unsheathed his sword, and countered Bolazgar's clumsy attack with a block, and than decapitated Bolazgar, killing him, and therefore making Kurog the new chief of the clan. Each member dropped to their knees and yelled \"Long live Chief Kurog!,\" to which Kurog proclaimed \"Today begins a new day for the Orsimer! I will lead you to glory! On this, you have my word!\"\nKurog spent a few years consolidating his power, growing his clan, marrying wives, and forming alliances with clan chiefs that supported his ideas. To secure her son's success and future, his mother &lt;a href=\"Forge-Mother%20Alga\"&gt;Alga&lt;/a&gt; became Grand Forge-Mother, and became an advisor and negotiator for her son. For his hunt-wife, Kurog and Alga turned to &lt;a href=\"Shatul%20Clan\"&gt;Shatul Clan&lt;/a&gt;, known for their prized skills in hunting, and Kurog married Hunt-Wife Noroga. For his Forge-Wife, the obvious choice was &lt;a href=\"Ashaka\"&gt;Ashaka&lt;/a&gt; from the prized smiths of &lt;a href=\"Morkul%20Clan\"&gt;Morkul Clan&lt;/a&gt;, but Alga was more interested in &lt;a href=\"Forge-Wife%20Tugha\"&gt;Tugha&lt;/a&gt;. Tugha had studied abroad with the smiths of western Skyrim for two years, with her experience, modern attitudes, and intelligence winning her the place of Kurog's Forge-Wife. Kurog married had many other wives who worked behind the scenes handling a number of different matters, such as his Immigration-Wife Uulitag.\nAlliance with the Daggerfall Covenant.\nHe soon turned his resources to &lt;a href=\"Falkreath%20Hold\"&gt;Falkreath Hold&lt;/a&gt; of Western &lt;a href=\"Skyrim\"&gt;Skyrim&lt;/a&gt;, hoping to rebuild a great city that could rival Wayrest on the site of Yashnag gro-Yazgu's stronghold. In &lt;a href=\"2E%20566\"&gt;2E 566&lt;/a&gt;, despite the &lt;a href=\"Nords\"&gt;Nords&lt;/a&gt;' civil war and &lt;a href=\"Skyrim%20Schism\"&gt;Schism&lt;/a&gt; years prior, they still proved to be resistant fighters, forcing Kurog to be stationed outside &lt;a href=\"Dragonstar\"&gt;Dragonstar&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"Craglorn\"&gt;Craglorn&lt;/a&gt; with his troops. King Emeric was fighting in &lt;a href=\"King%20Ranser%27s%20War\"&gt;King Ranser's War&lt;/a&gt;, and sent Zephrine Frey as an emissary to meet with Kurog. She asked of Kurog's assistance in the war, and while Kurog was willing to participate, he required a number of demands before he could declare war on &lt;a href=\"King%20Ranser\"&gt;King Ranser&lt;/a&gt;. Emeric agreed to the terms, granting Kurog de jure control of Wrothgar, supporting construction of Orsinium, agreeing to prohibit Breton or Redguard armies enter the region due to the prior Sieges, and be recognized as an equal in the Covenant. Kurog and his troops were responsible for setting &lt;a href=\"Shornhelm%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Shornhelm&lt;/a&gt; ablaze when &lt;a href=\"King%20Ranser\"&gt;King Ranser&lt;/a&gt; returned, proving to be a key and final part in defeating him. Ranser then retreated to &lt;a href=\"Traitor%27s%20Tor%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Traitor's Tor&lt;/a&gt;, and met his last stand under Kurog's troops.\nIn &lt;a href=\"2E%20581\"&gt;2E 581&lt;/a&gt;, Kurog visited &lt;a href=\"Evermore%20Castle\"&gt;Evermore Palace&lt;/a&gt; and met with &lt;a href=\"Flaccus%20Terentius\"&gt;Flaccus Terentius&lt;/a&gt;.\nConversations.\nWhen first meeting him:\nKing Kurog: \"I want the soldiers from all the clans to circle the fort. Ice-Heart won't escape me this time.\"\nChief Ruzgrol: \"Our soldiers know what to do, Kurog. You can count on that.\"\nKing Kurog: \"Then maybe this victory will finally convince you and the other chiefs to fully accept my claim to the throne.\"\nUpon entering Ice-Heart's Lair:\n&lt;a href=\"Urfon%20Ice-Heart\"&gt;Urfon Ice-Heart&lt;/a&gt;: \"\"So the king of the &lt;a href=\"Orsimer%20%28Online%29\"&gt;pig children&lt;/a&gt; has come to die. Your soldiers failed, Kurog. And so will you.\"\"\nKing Kurog: \"Hahahaha! I love it when my enemies mock me, helps me work up a good rage.\"\nUrfon Ice-Heart: \"You treat everything like a joke! That's why the Orcs refuse to follow you. You mock the fallen and dishonor their sacrifices!\"\nKing Kurog: \"Dishonor? Ha! I'll honor them, by separating your head, from your body!\"\nIn the throne room:\nKing Kurog: \"Excellent! Everyone's here! The time has come. Swear allegiance to me. Orsinium will prosper once the clans unite under my rule.\"\nChief Bazrag: \"This again, Kurog? Why should we submit to you this time?\"\nKing Kurog: \"Behold! I wield the blade of Ice-Heart! With the help of outsiders, I have vanquished our greatest foe and retrieved the stolen supplies! The chiefs could not stop the Winterborn! Only I have accomplished that!\"\nChief Bazrag: \"You ask much, Kurog. To turn away from Malacath? To abandon our most cherished customs?\"\nKing Kurog: \"Bazrag, my old friend, your outdated ideas will be the death of me.\"\nChief Targak: \"Don't tempt us, Kurog! Our traditions won't bend to the will of an idiot chief who decides to call himself kin\u2014\"\n&lt;King Kurog kills Chief Targak&gt;\nKing Kurog: \"Idiot? Chief? I am your king! You would all do well to remember that! Now get out of my sight.\"\nChief Bazrag: \"You embark upon a dangerous path, Kurog. We won't forget this.\"\nWhen approaching &lt;a href=\"Siege%20Commander%20Dulph\"&gt;Siege Commander Dulph&lt;/a&gt;:\nSiege Commander Dulph: \"If you don't find the alchemist and destroy those nests, we'll never break this siege!\"\nCaptain Gorrath: \"You heard him! For the king!\"\nSiege Commander Dulph: \"Get down!\"\n&lt;A harpy snatches Captain Gorrath&gt;\nCaptain Gorrath: \"No! No! Let me go!\"\nSiege Commander Dulph: \"Damn it! I lose more soldiers that way!\"\nKing Kurog: \"Looks like General Dulph could use a hand.\"\nKing Kurog: \"Damn it, you two always show up and ruin my fun!\"\nShield-Wife Razbela: \"Oh, I have not even begun to ruin your fun, my king. But let's leave the pleasantries for later. We have an urgent situation to report.\"\nKing Kurog: \"I can never tell when you're joking. Fine. What's so important?\"\nShield-Wife Oshgana: \"\"The &lt;a href=\"Temple%20of%20Ire\"&gt;Trinimac temple&lt;/a&gt; has been attacked, my beloved. &lt;a href=\"Malacath\"&gt;Malacath&lt;/a&gt; devotees have barricaded the doors and taken the &lt;a href=\"Priest%20of%20Trinimac\"&gt;priests&lt;/a&gt; as hostages.\"\nKing Kurog: \"These fanatics dare to attack &lt;a href=\"Orsinium%20%28Online%29\"&gt;my city&lt;/a&gt;? My people\u203d I'll deal with them personally!\"\"\nForge-Mother Alga: \"You will do no such thing, my son. After what happened in the throne room, this is undoubtedly a trap.\"\nKing Kurog: \"I won't sit by while they attack my city!\"\nForge-Mother Alga: \"\"This problem requires a personal solution, and I have a perfect idea. &lt;a href=\"Vestige\"&gt;Outsider&lt;/a&gt;, let us talk.\"\"\nForge-Mother Alga: \"Let it be known, the outsider who stands before us has betrayed our great city! For your actions, I condemn you and your allies to death. A sentence you shall execute by your own hand. May Trinimac guide your blade.\"\nKing Kurog: \"I'm sorry it had to come to this. But what I do I do for the good of the Orsimer people.\"\nIn the tunnels, if Eveli came along:\n&lt;a href=\"King%20Kurog\"&gt;King Kurog&lt;/a&gt;: \"Silence, chiefs! Your constant bickering has plagued our people for long enough!\"\nChief Bazrag: \"Kurog's belittling the chiefs. They won't stand for that.\"\nKing Kurog: \"You isolate yourselves in your own strongholds, perpetuating our selfish nature. We must change who and what we are!\"\n&lt;a href=\"Eveli%20Sharp-Arrow\"&gt;Eveli Sharp-Arrow&lt;/a&gt;: \"Kurog's got a point. We're still going to kill the bastard, right.\"\nKing Kurog: \"I tried to appeal to you as equals, but you refused to listen. I grow tired of arguing with you.\"\n&lt;a href=\"Forge-Mother%20Alga\"&gt;Forge-Mother Alga&lt;/a&gt;: \"The king cares for our people and all you do is break his heart.\"\nChief Bazrag: \"Wonderful. The murderous king and his lunatic mother. This will be interesting.\nWe're getting close. Be ready for anything.\"\nEveli Sharp-Arrow: \"\"Sounds like the time I walked in on an &lt;a href=\"Imga\"&gt;Imga&lt;/a&gt; courting ritual!\"\nKing Kurog: \"The choice is simple. Kneel before me as your king and ruler of the united &lt;a href=\"Orsimer%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Orsimer&lt;/a&gt; nation\u2015or die!\"\"\nChief Bazrag: \"\"We need to move faster. Kurog's about to start slaughtering the chiefs!\nOnce we get inside, find Kurog and take him down. We need to save as many chiefs as we can.\nWhen confronting him, if Eveli came along:\nChief Bazrag: \"There's still time if we move fast. We need to open this gate.\"\nEveli Sharp-Arrow: \"There's no lever. They must have shut it from the other side.\"\nChief Bazrag: \"Stand aside and let me work! Get ready to pull those people out of there!\"\nKing Kurog: \"You leave me no choice. I'll unite the clans over your dead bodies!\"\nForge-Mother Alga: \"But don't worry. Trinimac is waiting for you on the other side.\"\nKing Kurog: \"Archers, eliminate the clan chiefs!\"\n&lt;a href=\"Chief%20Ramash\"&gt;Chief Ramash&lt;/a&gt;: \"We've been betrayed! Defend yourselves!\"\nKing Kurog: \"And now the last guest has arrived. I'm going to make you pay for your disloyalty.\"\nChief Bazrag: \"Clan chiefs, over here! Arrgh!

Don't get yourself killed without me!\"\nKing Kurog: \"As impressive as always, but it doesn't matter. My soldiers are already moving to block the tunnels.\nBut even impressive criminals must pay for their crimes. I'm going to deal with you\u2015personally!\nBow before the king of the Orsimer!\"\nIn the tunnels, if Eveli got injured:\n&lt;a href=\"King%20Kurog\"&gt;King Kurog&lt;/a&gt;: \"Silence, chiefs!

{"id": "915485", "revid": "17401442", "url": "https://elderscrolls.fandom.com/wiki?curid=915485", "title": "Kvatch", "text": "Kvatch is one of the nine major counties in the province of &lt;a href=\"Cyrodiil\"&gt;Cyrodiil&lt;/a&gt;, and is situated in the eastern hills of the &lt;a href=\"Gold%20Coast\"&gt;Gold Coast&lt;/a&gt;. Kvatch was the holy city of &lt;a href=\"Akatosh\"&gt;Akatosh&lt;/a&gt;. Worship of Akatosh was prevalent in Kvatch and it was the location of a chapter of the &lt;a href=\"Order%20of%20the%20Hour\"&gt;Order of the Hour&lt;/a&gt;.\nDescription.\nGeography.\nKvatch is situated off the &lt;a href=\"Gold%20Road\"&gt;Gold Road&lt;/a&gt;, between the cities of &lt;a href=\"Anvil\"&gt;Anvil&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Skingrad\"&gt;Skingrad&lt;/a&gt;, and overlooks the entire region. The main street of Kvatch extends north from the city gate and circles around the &lt;a href=\"Chapel%20of%20Akatosh\"&gt;Chapel of Akatosh&lt;/a&gt;, which is in the center of town. North of the Chapel, a street leads to the local marketplace, the &lt;a href=\"Trader%27s%20Circle\"&gt;Trader's Circle&lt;/a&gt;. The Circle extends to the northwest towards &lt;a href=\"Castle%20Kvatch\"&gt;Castle Kvatch&lt;/a&gt;. A small moat separates the castle from the town. East of the castle, along the main street, is the &lt;a href=\"Kvatch%20Arena\"&gt;Kvatch Arena&lt;/a&gt;. The arena is one of the two colosseums in Cyrodiil, with the other one being in the &lt;a href=\"Arena%20District\"&gt;Arena District&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;a href=\"Imperial%20City\"&gt;Imperial City&lt;/a&gt;. Along the southeast wall is a road connecting the Main Gate to the &lt;a href=\"Tower%20of%20Judgement\"&gt;Tower of Judgement&lt;/a&gt; and then back of the Chapel. &lt;a href=\"The%20Eight%20Blessings\"&gt;The Eight Blessings&lt;/a&gt; is the largest inn in Kvatch and it has a bridge connecting to the shop across the street. Another street can be found along the western wall and behind the inn. This area has several homes and a hedge maze. Underneath the city is a passageway that leads into the Castle.\nHistory.\n&lt;a href=\"First%20Era\"&gt;First Era&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe Tale of Lord Nunex Faleria.\nDuring the early years of the &lt;a href=\"Alessian%20Doctrines\"&gt;Alessian Doctrines&lt;/a&gt;, three leaders ruled over Kvatch as a council. The names of two have been lost in history. The third, &lt;a href=\"Lord%20Nunex%20Faleria\"&gt;Lord Nunex Faleria&lt;/a&gt;, was in love with an &lt;a href=\"Ayleid\"&gt;Ayleid&lt;/a&gt; scholar from the city of &lt;a href=\"Nenalata\"&gt;Nenalata&lt;/a&gt;. To protect his love, Nunex established a stronghold deep in the Gold Coast and named it &lt;a href=\"Fort%20Faleria\"&gt;Fort Faleria&lt;/a&gt;. To protect it further, he used magic, hired workers, and a tribe of &lt;a href=\"Minotaur\"&gt;Minotaur&lt;/a&gt;s to guard it. As time went on, Nunex and Lady Faleria had a family, with three children. Eventually, Lady Faleria died and Nunex built a brass tomb for her in Fort Faleria.\nFaleria's Demise.\nDuring his and his family's residency at the fort, Lord Faleria delved into dark magic. One day, the youngest child escaped and met a young woman, whom he fell in love with. When her family discovered his Elven heritage, she was forced to confess and word of this brought the Empire to Fort Faleria. Lord Faleria committed a gruesome ritual, which ended with his family's death and the destruction of Fort Faleria. With his remaining strength, he buried his family on the surface and remained in the ruins of Fort Faleria, where it faded into obscurity as Tribune's Folly.\nRislav the Righteous and the Coup at Skingrad.\nDuring the fifth century, Kvatch was ruled by &lt;a href=\"King%20Justinius\"&gt;King Justinius&lt;/a&gt; and it fought against &lt;a href=\"Skingrad\"&gt;Skingrad&lt;/a&gt; in minor skirmishes over common territory in the &lt;a href=\"Colovian%20West\"&gt;Colovian West&lt;/a&gt;. This would last until &lt;a href=\"1E%20472\"&gt;1E 472&lt;/a&gt;, when the marriage of Princess &lt;a href=\"Belene\"&gt;Belene&lt;/a&gt; of Kvatch and &lt;a href=\"Rislav%20Larich\"&gt;Rislav Larich&lt;/a&gt; of Skingrad ended the fighting. Rislav remained in the Court of Kvatch for six years after that until when in &lt;a href=\"1E%20478\"&gt;1E 478&lt;/a&gt;, an unknown disease spread throughout Cyrodiil. The disease killed most of the Larich family in Skingrad, leaving only Rislav and his older brother, &lt;a href=\"Dorald%20Larich\"&gt;Dorald Larich&lt;/a&gt;. When news of this was received by the brothers, Dorald left for Skingrad where he took control of the town. His first decree was to have Skingrad cede to the &lt;a href=\"Alessian%20Empire\"&gt;Alessian Empire&lt;/a&gt;, which outraged and shocked the Colovian West, and Rislav and the Court of Kvatch even more so. Rislav, his wife, and a militia of Kvatchian Soldiers attacked Skingrad during the &lt;a href=\"Coup%20at%20Skingrad\"&gt;Coup at Skingrad&lt;/a&gt;. Rislav decapitated Dorald and took the position of King of Skingrad. From then on, the Colovian West rebelled against the Alessian Empire, including various acts of rebellion such as the &lt;a href=\"Battle%20of%20Glenumbra%20Moors%20%28Event%29\"&gt;Battle of Glenumbria Moors&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Battle%20of%20Sungard\"&gt;Battle of Sungard&lt;/a&gt;.\n&lt;a href=\"Second%20Era\"&gt;Second Era&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe Founding of the Order of the Hour.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Akatosh%20Chantry\"&gt;Akatosh Chantry&lt;/a&gt; is located in Kvatch. During the &lt;a href=\"Interregnum\"&gt;Interregnum&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"Longhouse%20Emperors\"&gt;Longhouse Emperors&lt;/a&gt; under &lt;a href=\"Durcorach%20the%20Black%20Drake\"&gt;Durcorach the Black Drake&lt;/a&gt; had been formed from &lt;a href=\"Reachmen\"&gt;Reachmen&lt;/a&gt; Emperors. Given the Daedra worship that the Reachmen practiced, many believed that a purge against worship of the Divines would occur. Many took up arms, preparing for such an event. One such person was &lt;a href=\"Cavor%20Merula\"&gt;Cavor Merula&lt;/a&gt;, who had re-established the &lt;a href=\"Order%20of%20the%20Hour\"&gt;Order of the Hour&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"2E%20432\"&gt;2E 432&lt;/a&gt; to protect the Chantry and the treasures stored within the vaults. The Order recruited devoted priests and soldiers of Akatosh and trained every day. The anticipated purge never came and the Order remained as sworn protectors of the Akatosh Cathedral.\nActions of the Order.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Kvatch%20Bread%20Riots\"&gt;Kvatch Bread Riots&lt;/a&gt; occurred in &lt;a href=\"2E%20467\"&gt;2E 467&lt;/a&gt; when Kvatch had suffered from the &lt;a href=\"Red%20Wheat%20Blight\"&gt;Red Wheat Blight&lt;/a&gt; that killed off the crops for the second year in a row. Feeling that the Akatosh Chantry was not doing enough to rectify the situation, &lt;a href=\"Gruff%20Bojour\"&gt;Gruff Bojour&lt;/a&gt; incited a mob riot outside the Cathedral, with the intent of inflicting violence and making their disdain known to the Chantry. But the Order of the Hour had prepared for this and &lt;a href=\"Sister%20Severa\"&gt;Sister Severa&lt;/a&gt; and her squadron slaughtered the rioters before they took action. The Primate at the time decided to pray for the passing of the blight and it disappeared after the next season passed. The Order also saved &lt;a href=\"Primate%20Phrastus\"&gt;Primate Phrastus&lt;/a&gt; from an assassination attempt in &lt;a href=\"2E%20540\"&gt;2E 540&lt;/a&gt; and saved priests from a bandit caravan in &lt;a href=\"2E%20561\"&gt;2E 561&lt;/a&gt;. Anyone who recognized Akatosh as their divine savior was protected by the Order.\nThe Militarized Order and Varen's Rebellion.\nIn &lt;a href=\"2E%20480\"&gt;2E 480&lt;/a&gt;, a writ from the Primate of Akatosh named the Order of the Hour as a militarized faction during times of religious emergencies and they became the protectors of Kvatch. They defended Kvatch several times, including when &lt;a href=\"Baz%20Swordbreaker\"&gt;Baz Swordbreaker&lt;/a&gt; attacked Kvatch with an &lt;a href=\"Orc\"&gt;Orc&lt;/a&gt;ish horde. In response, the Order worked with the Kvatch Guards. After the army disbanded, the Order resumed their original role of protectors of the Cathedral. In &lt;a href=\"2E%20576\"&gt;2E 576&lt;/a&gt;, A son of Kvatch and Duke of &lt;a href=\"Chorrol\"&gt;Chorrol&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Varen%20Aquilarios\"&gt;Varen Aquilarios&lt;/a&gt; waged war against the Emperor, attempting to dethrone him and assume power.\nCount Carolus Aquilarios and Varen's Wall.\nTo protect his original domain, the Gold Coast, Varen Aquilarios commissioned the construction of a stone wall to defend against attacks by Leovic's forces. This wall was designed by &lt;a href=\"Jaros%20Truptor\"&gt;Jaros Truptor&lt;/a&gt; and named &lt;a href=\"Varen%27s%20Wall%20%28Location%29\"&gt;Varen's Wall&lt;/a&gt;. Because of this, the Gold Coast did not fall into ruin like the rest of Cyrodiil. Varen took the &lt;a href=\"Second%20Legion\"&gt;Second Legion&lt;/a&gt; from the Gold Coast and used it in his fight against the Emperor. He left the throne of Kvatch to his nephew, &lt;a href=\"Carolus%20Aquilarios\"&gt;Carolus Aquilarios&lt;/a&gt;, whom he believed was worthy of protecting the county. Shortly after this, &lt;a href=\"Ephrem%20Benirus\"&gt;Ephrem Benirus&lt;/a&gt;, the Count of &lt;a href=\"Anvil\"&gt;Anvil&lt;/a&gt; and Imperial Praefect decided to rally his forces and try to take control of Kvatch. With what little he had, Carolus had defended Kvatch from Count Benirus and he was promoted to Count of Kvatch. Benirus attempted to take Kvatch a total of three times, each time with dwindling forces. He eventually gave up and lost Anvil to &lt;a href=\"Fortunata%20ap%20Dugal\"&gt;Fortunata ap Dugal&lt;/a&gt; of the &lt;a href=\"Red%20Sails\"&gt;Red Sails&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe Wolf of Kvatch.\nDue to his bravery, Carolus was given the name the Wolf of Kvatch and this marked the start of using the wolf as the symbol of the county. Things became much harder for Carolus when &lt;a href=\"Artorius%20Ponticus\"&gt;Artorius Ponticus&lt;/a&gt;, the Primate of the Order, took an interest in expanding the Order's power over Kvatch and attempted and failed to overpower Carolus and his Kvatch Guard. Eventually in &lt;a href=\"2E%20582\"&gt;2E 582&lt;/a&gt;, Varen disappeared from the Imperial City and the &lt;a href=\"Planemeld\"&gt;Planemeld&lt;/a&gt; arrived. With the Ruby Throne empty, the &lt;a href=\"Alliance%20War\"&gt;Alliance War&lt;/a&gt; advanced into Cyrodiil, waging war across the land. Once again, Varen's Wall spared Kvatch from destruction.\nThe Dark Brotherhood and the Order of the Hour.\nIn &lt;a href=\"2E%20583\"&gt;2E 583&lt;/a&gt;, Carolus Aquilarios continued to rule over Kvatch. The &lt;a href=\"Dark%20Brotherhood%20%28Online%20Faction%29\"&gt;Dark Brotherhood's&lt;/a&gt; first notable target that year, &lt;a href=\"Quintus%20Jarol\"&gt;Quintus Jarol&lt;/a&gt;, was an Imperial nobleman living near Anvil. The Dark Brotherhood became known throughout the region, bringing them to the attention of the leaders of both Anvil and Kvatch, as well as making the Order of the Hour take action. &lt;a href=\"Fithia%20at-Himah\"&gt;Fithia at-Himah&lt;/a&gt;, the Grand Sermonizer of the Chantry, started a mission to preach against the Brotherhood in an attempt to bring them out of the shadows. Priests of Akatosh were killed as they started to preach in the streets of Kvatch. Eventually, At-Himah was able to capture &lt;a href=\"Cimbar\"&gt;Cimbar&lt;/a&gt; of the Brotherhood with the help of &lt;a href=\"the%20Black%20Dragon\"&gt;the Black Dragon&lt;/a&gt;, a mysterious warrior of Akatosh. As the Black Dragon was leaving the &lt;a href=\"At-Himah%20Family%20Estate\"&gt;At-Himah Family Estate&lt;/a&gt;, the Brotherhood made their move and killed Fithia. This would lead to an all-out hidden war between the Brotherhood and the Order.\nThe Hidden Alliance of the Wolf and the Brotherhood.\nThe Dark Brotherhood accepted a contract from Fortunata ap Dugal herself to assassinate &lt;a href=\"Marcus%20Scipio\"&gt;Marcus Scipio&lt;/a&gt;, the leader of the Order. The Brotherhood infiltrated &lt;a href=\"Castle%20Kvatch\"&gt;Castle Kvatch&lt;/a&gt; and killed Scipio, but as they were leaving, Count Aquilarios performed the &lt;a href=\"Black%20Sacrament\"&gt;Black Sacrament&lt;/a&gt;. This got the attention of &lt;a href=\"Speaker%20Terenus\"&gt;Speaker Terenus&lt;/a&gt; and eventually lead to the death of Fortunata ap Dugal, who was poisoned and fell from her balcony. This pair of murders produced an alliance between the Brotherhood and Carolus of Kvatch. The Black Dragon continued to kill Brotherhood assassins, as the Brotherhood thwarted members of the Order and Carolus provided information for the Brotherhood on the Order and the Dragon. When the Black Dragon died, the Dark Brotherhood decided to end the Order's war against them by assassinating Primate Artorius inside of the Cathedral of Akatosh. After delving through the Kvatch Catacombs, the Dark Brotherhood ultimately killed Ponticus, ending the Order's reign over the Gold Coast. From then on Carolus continued to rule over Kvatch and most of the Gold Coast.\nThe Sweetroll Killer of the Gold Coast.\nAround the same time, a murderer known as the &lt;a href=\"Louna%20%28Dunmer%29\"&gt;Sweetroll Killer&lt;/a&gt; appeared, killing citizens from Kvatch to Anvil. The Sweetroll Killer murdered regular citizens and advisors of &lt;a href=\"Queen%20Ayrenn\"&gt;Queen Ayrenn&lt;/a&gt; from the &lt;a href=\"Aldmeri%20Dominion\"&gt;Aldmeri Dominion&lt;/a&gt;. This had brought them to the attention of both the &lt;a href=\"Eyes%20of%20the%20Queen\"&gt;Eyes of the Queen&lt;/a&gt; and apparently the &lt;a href=\"Morag%20Tong\"&gt;Morag Tong&lt;/a&gt;. Both &lt;a href=\"Razum-dar\"&gt;Razum-dar&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Naryu%20Virian\"&gt;Naryu Virian&lt;/a&gt; of these respective factions took to investigating these murders with their &lt;a href=\"Vestige\"&gt;mutual friend&lt;/a&gt;. Each of the people that were intended as victims were warned by their receiving a &lt;a href=\"Sweetroll\"&gt;sweetroll&lt;/a&gt;, yet their individual fates are unknown, nor is it clear how many of them were actually killed. The murderer turned out to be a &lt;a href=\"Dunmer\"&gt;Dunmer&lt;/a&gt; farmer named Louna, was a member of the &lt;a href=\"Fate-Bearers\"&gt;Fate-Bearers&lt;/a&gt;. The three were able to defeat the Fate-Bearers and yet Louna's fate is also unknown. Razum-dar preferred to let her leave, since the case was already over, while Naryu preferred to have her dead so that no more murders would be committed.\n&lt;a href=\"Third%20Era\"&gt;Third Era&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe Camoran Usurper.\nSometime around &lt;a href=\"3E%20266\"&gt;3E 266&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Haymon%20Camoran\"&gt;Haymon Camoran&lt;/a&gt; had begun his conquest of Western Tamriel, starting from &lt;a href=\"Arenthia\"&gt;Arenthia&lt;/a&gt; and continuing towards the &lt;a href=\"Abecean%20Sea\"&gt;Abecean Sea&lt;/a&gt;. Because of its proximity, the Colovian West was one of the first places to be attacked. The Camoran Usurper, as Haymon became known as, besieged Kvatch. His army was rumored to consist of undead and &lt;a href=\"Daedra\"&gt;Daedra&lt;/a&gt; when in reality, it was made up of mercenaries of Hammerfell and Valenwood. His invasion was successful until it reached the northern &lt;a href=\"Iliac%20Bay\"&gt;Iliac Bay&lt;/a&gt;, where his armies would be defeated by a combined force led by the &lt;a href=\"Barony%20of%20Dwynnen\"&gt;Barony of Dwynnen&lt;/a&gt; and warriors of the &lt;a href=\"Wrothgarian%20Mountains\"&gt;Wrothgarian Mountains&lt;/a&gt;. Haymon would die in a fire and his son would be born afterward in &lt;a href=\"Castle%20Wightmoor\"&gt;Castle Wightmoor&lt;/a&gt; by his mistress, &lt;a href=\"Kaalys\"&gt;Kaalys&lt;/a&gt;. His son's name was &lt;a href=\"Mankar%20Camoran\"&gt;Mankar Camoran&lt;/a&gt;.\nLate Third Era.\nDuring the waning years of the third era, Kvatch was ruled by &lt;a href=\"Ormellius%20Goldwine\"&gt;Ormellius Goldwine&lt;/a&gt;, whose family had suffered personal strifes. Ormellius' sons were killed, trying to gain their inheritance. But as times became more peaceful, the Count would stay in mourning, remaining as the Count of Kvatch. Around this time, &lt;a href=\"Saint%20Jiub\"&gt;Saint Jiub&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"Morrowind\"&gt;Morrowind&lt;/a&gt; had relocated to Kvatch, with the intent of writing his autobiography, &lt;a href=\"Saint%20Jiub%27s%20Opus\"&gt;Saint Jiub's Opus&lt;/a&gt;. However, a new threat in the form of the &lt;a href=\"Mythic%20Dawn\"&gt;Mythic Dawn&lt;/a&gt; appeared, assassinating the sons of &lt;a href=\"Uriel%20Septim%20VII\"&gt;Uriel Septim VII&lt;/a&gt;, including the heir to the throne, &lt;a href=\"Geldall%20Septim\"&gt;Geldall Septim&lt;/a&gt;. On the 27th of &lt;a href=\"Last%20Seed\"&gt;Last Seed&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"3E%20433\"&gt;3E 433&lt;/a&gt;, Uriel Septim VII would be killed as he was attempting to escape via the Imperial Sewers. The &lt;a href=\"Dragonfires\"&gt;Dragonfires&lt;/a&gt; would not be re-lit and the &lt;a href=\"Oblivion%20Crisis\"&gt;Oblivion Crisis&lt;/a&gt; began with Kvatch as its first target.\nThe Battle of Kvatch.\nThe Crisis took the form of an &lt;a href=\"Oblivion%20Gate%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;Oblivion Gate&lt;/a&gt; that spewed forth &lt;a href=\"Daedra\"&gt;daedra&lt;/a&gt; that ransacked the entire settlement and left very few survivors. The invading daedra killed Count Ormellius Goldwine and the castle was mostly destroyed. &lt;a href=\"Savlian%20Matius\"&gt;Savlian Matius&lt;/a&gt;, the Head of the Kvatch Guard, rescued several citizens and took them to the outskirts of the city. &lt;a href=\"Brother%20Martin\"&gt;Brother Martin&lt;/a&gt; of the Akatosh Chantry was able to safeguard some people within the Chapel of Akatosh. Their efforts at permanently defeating the Daedra were ineffective until the arrival of &lt;a href=\"Hero%20of%20Kvatch\"&gt;Hero of Kvatch&lt;/a&gt;, who was able to enter the &lt;a href=\"Oblivion%20Gate\"&gt;Oblivion Gate&lt;/a&gt; and destroy it. With the Gate destroyed, Matius was able to retake the city, defeating the remaining daedra and retrieving the &lt;a href=\"Colovian%20Signet%20Ring\"&gt;Colovian Signet Ring&lt;/a&gt; from Count Goldwine's body. The events of the &lt;a href=\"Battle%20of%20Kvatch\"&gt;Battle of Kvatch&lt;/a&gt; did show the Hero and the other counties the method for defeating the daedric invasion."}

Before its destruction, Kvatch was the second largest city in &lt;a href=\"Cyrodiil\"&gt;Cyrodiil&lt;/a&gt;, in front of Skingrad and behind the Imperial City.

According to the book \"&lt;a href=\"Rislav%20the%20Righteous\"&gt;Rislav the Righteous&lt;/a&gt;\", peace was declared this year. It can be assumed that the children, &lt;a href=\"Rislav%20Larich\"&gt;Rislav Larich&lt;/a&gt; and Belene, the daughter of King Justinius of Kvatch were married here to make peace.\nThird Era.\nThe first battle of the Oblivion Crisis occurs here, the &lt;a href=\"Battle%20of%20Kvatch\"&gt;Battle of Kvatch&lt;/a&gt;. Daedric forces open an Oblivion portal in an effort to kill &lt;a href=\"Martin%20Septim%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;Martin Septim&lt;/a&gt;. The &lt;a href=\"Kvatch%20Guard\"&gt;Kvatch City Guard&lt;/a&gt; along with the Hero rout the enemy forces and secure victory. Afterwards, a smaller scale attack is lead against the Daedra occupying the castle.\nFourth Era.\nDuring the &lt;a href=\"Great%20War\"&gt;Great War&lt;/a&gt;,\u00a0&lt;a href=\"Aldmeri%20Dominion%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Aldmeri Dominion&lt;/a&gt; forces bypassed Kvatch on their way to &lt;a href=\"Hammerfell\"&gt;Hammerfell&lt;/a&gt;.

{"id": "1555", "revid": "17401442", "url": "https://elderscrolls.fandom.com/wiki?curid=1555", "title": "Kwama (Morrowind)", "text": "The kwama are a group of insect-like creatures in the game . They are a hive organism with a strict hierarchy and are a crucial part of economics in the region of &lt;a href=\"Morrowind\"&gt;Morrowind&lt;/a&gt;.\nImpacts on economy.\nKwama work in an underground colony similar to ant hives. These colonies are called egg mines, due to their size and structure: egg mines are consistently large enough to allow entrance of miners, and some egg mines are obviously man-made or man-maintained due to supports that have been erected. Egg mines are typically labyrinthine and can have several separate chambers depending on their size and importance. There are kwama egg mines scattered throughout &lt;a href=\"Vvardenfell%20%28Morrowind%29\"&gt;Vvardenfell&lt;/a&gt;, including some that would appear to be populated by wild kwama or kwama that have reverted to such a state. In these \"wild\" mines, all kwama, including the normally docile workers, will attack anyone who enters, and occasionally the dead bodies of kwama miners will be found. These mines may be identified by a red haze that pervades through the mine, possibly a sign of the &lt;a href=\"ashblight\"&gt;ashblight&lt;/a&gt;. Care should be taken by beginning players who enter these mines, as the kwama warriors may prove to be too much of a match for them.\nThe ingredients collected from the kwama, including kwama eggs, kwama cuttle, scrib jelly and scrib jerky, are vital to the economy of Vvardenfell, making the egg mining industry extremely important. All great houses of Vvardenfell own several mines as a basic economic foothold, and many Vvardenfell citizens' welfare revolves around the protection and care of kwama. This practice has gone on for long enough for a symbiotic relationship to form between the miners and the kwama. Kwama foragers and warriors, normally aggressive, will not attack miners, knowing through scent that the miners are not a threat. Killing a kwama queen will kill the entire mine and thus doing so jeopardizes the economy of Vvardenfell. This action is thus heavily looked-down upon but is nevertheless legal, some in-game missions include killing egg mines owned by rivals in business. Despite this, most inhabitants of Vvardenfell recognize the importance of every egg mine, and so several other missions, including one given by the &lt;a href=\"Imperial%20Legion%20%28Morrowind%29\"&gt;Imperial Legion&lt;/a&gt;, involve saving the egg mines, usually in the form of curing the queen of the &lt;a href=\"Ashblight\"&gt;blight&lt;/a&gt; and in so doing rendering the mine usable. Due to the importance of egg mines, towns tend to spring up near them, much as they do in real-life mining towns. &lt;a href=\"Gnisis%20%28Morrowind%29\"&gt;Gnisis&lt;/a&gt; is an example of one such town, as its entire economy and well-being depend on the mine in town.\nHierarchy.\nThe kwama family consists of scribs, kwama foragers, kwama workers, kwama warriors and kwama queens. The queens are at the top tier, as is expected, however they are bloated and unable to move, and so are tended by workers and defended by warriors. Foragers search for sources of food and possible locations of new mines, and scrib, as larva, grow into other types of kwama and can defend the mine in minuscule ways if absolutely necessary.\nScrib.\nScribs are the late larval stage of the kwama. They resemble large whitish bugs with eight jointed legs. Scribs are found throughout Vvardenfell, but unlike kwama foragers and most other creatures, they will not attack. They are quite possibly the weakest creatures in the game, with the exception of kwama queens who are unable to defend themselves at all, and so are useful for beginning players to use to improve their skills.\nScrib jelly can be found on dead scribs and may be used in alchemy to create potions that cure blight diseases. Scrib jerky, which is made by drying a sliced scrib, restores fatigue, but players can only find it in containers and shops, not on scribs themselves. Both ingredients are a staple of Vvardenfell cuisine, making Kwama mines all the more valuable. Miners in egg mines discourage players from killing scribs, in part because of the resources that can be gained from them, but also due to the fact that they are larval and can become any other type of kwama.\nKwama forager.\nKwama foragers are the scouts of kwama egg mines. They can be found in many areas of &lt;a href=\"Vvardenfell%20%28Morrowind%29\"&gt;Vvardenfell&lt;/a&gt;, including the Bitter Coast, the Grazelands, Ascadian Isles, the ashlands, and some parts of Azura's Coast and Sheogorad, as well as inside any egg mines players may come across. Their function is essentially to scout out locations for the hive; finding possible locations for new mines, food, water, enemies, and so forth. They are aggressive and will attack players on sight, but are also very weak and simple to dispatch. Kwama foragers will attack in close combat, ramming against players.\nKwama foragers are the lowest tier of the kwama hierarchy, not counting scribs as they are a larval form and still growing. They are brownish tan, cone shaped and wormlike, with a round mouth and several small teeth. Kwama foragers move with a distinctive squishing sound that alerts players to their presence. Kwama foragers, along with kwama warriors, are the only types of kwama that will attack players on sight rather than only in self-defense, however they will not attack egg miners due to their scent.\nKwama worker.\nKwama Workers are the workhorses of kwama egg mines. Their place in the kwama hierarchy is to serve the kwama queen, care for the eggs, and produce food for the mine, although what kwamas eat is uncertain. Kwama workers are generally docile and will not attack passerby, but if attacked they will defend themselves. Kwama workers are situated roughly in the lower middle tier of the kwama hierarchy, directly above kwama foragers and below kwama warriors, both of which are hostile to intruders. Kwama workers are brown, striped with darker and lighter areas of the same color, and quadrupedal.\nIn game, players may choose to attack Kwama workers for training or sport. This is discouraged by &lt;a href=\"Characters%20%28Morrowind%29\"&gt;characters&lt;/a&gt; such as Kwama miners, as kwama workers are one of the more important members of an egg mine. Despite this, killing workers or damaging eggmines in any other way has no effect on in-game economy.\nKwama warrior.\nKwama Warriors are the defenders of kwama egg mines. They defend the passageways of the mine and attack intruders on sight. They are aggressive and highly dangerous to low level players, however most low level characters will not be asked to go to dangerous mines. Kwama warriors will cast lightning based spells on intruders from afar or may rush in and attack in close combat.\nTheir place in kwama hierarchy is the upper middle - directly above kwama workers and below kwama queens. Kwama warriors resemble a bipedal, slightly larger kwama worker, with what appears to be a kwama forager in its mouth, however the mouth is upside down compared to the worker. Kwama warriors are most often seen in or near the queen's lair, protecting her from intruders, so in larger egg mines warriors may not be seen near the entrance, making the mine deceptive at times.\nKwama queen.\nKwama queens are the \"leaders\" of kwama egg mines, found in the deepest chambers of egg mines. These areas are often referred to as \"queen's lairs.\" The queens are bloated and unable to move to defend or even feed themselves, and so are protected by kwama warriors, and tended to mainly by kwama workers. A kwama queen is the most important part of an egg mine, as she is the only egg layer. If a queen is killed, the mine is effectively killed as well. This can devastate the Vvardenfell economy as egg mines are a prime source of income, food, and employment. Though there are many egg mines, shipment of kwama eggs to certain regions can take longer because they are being shipped from a farther source instead of the region's primary source. Shortages of kwama eggs are also likely in the event of the death of a kwama queen. If the queen contracts the &lt;a href=\"ashblight\"&gt;ashblight&lt;/a&gt;, it can cause the entire mine to be shut down temporarily due to the higher probability of attacking kwama, as the ashblight will alter their thoughts, perception and knowledge. Another problem is that eggs from a blighted mine are inedible. The effects of this can be reversed by curing the queen, though it will most likely be a while before the mine could get back up on its feet.\nKwama queens are at the top of kwama hierarchy, above kwama warriors. Kwama queens are quadrupedal, brown and have what looks like a kwama forager in its mouth, similar to a kwama warrior. As stated before, they are extremely large and bloated, with an off-white eggsack on the rear. Kwama queens are the single easiest creature to kill in Vvardenfell as they are incapable of defending themselves, but are often protected by dangerous &lt;a href=\"%23Kwama%20warrior\"&gt;kwama warriors&lt;/a&gt;."}

Kwama mines can also produce tasty scrib jerky, acidic scrib jelly, and kwama cuttle, which is highly valued by alchemists.\nThe Kwama Colony: The road to owning a profitable mining concern starts with a healthy kwama queen and a full complement of &lt;a href=\"Kwama%20Worker%20%28Online%29\"&gt;workers&lt;/a&gt;. The queen produces eggs in the deepest recesses of the mine. Kwama workers care for the eggs, moving them to the various tunnels and chambers within the mine, according to space requirements, environmental conditions, and the development state of the eggs. Kwama workers also produce food for the mine, feed and clean the queen, and expand the mine complex as the colony grows. When not tending to their usual duties, workers can be seen digging new chambers and tunnels within the ever-growing labyrinth of the mine. Workers tend to be docile, but can turn violent if threatened or attacked, or if the queen is in danger.\nKwama &lt;a href=\"Kwama%20Warrior%20%28Online%29\"&gt;warriors&lt;/a&gt; protect the colony, reacting quickly to any perceived danger. They should be treated warily and with respect, for they are aggressive and highly dangerous. While workers are quadrupeds, warriors are bipedal and very powerful.\n&lt;a href=\"Scrib%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Scribs&lt;/a&gt;, as the miners call juvenile kwama, roam freely through a kwama colony. A mine usually splits the scrib herds into two camps: those allowed to grow into workers or warriors, and those harvested while still young for jelly and jerky. Scrib jelly has a variety of uses, including as a food source, but it is prized by alchemists as a key ingredient to create potions and cure diseases. Scrib jerky, made by drying thin slices of scrib meat, has minor restorative properties and is considered to be quite delicious by &lt;a href=\"Dunmer%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Dark Elf&lt;/a&gt; culinary experts.\nStarting a Kwama Mine: Assuming you don't want to pay the exorbitant fees associated with purchasing a queen and kwama from an established mine, you will need to locate and tame a wild colony. This approach isn't without cost, however, as House Hlaalu requires would-be mine owners to purchase a license before hunting for a wild colony in earnest.\nWhen you locate a potential colony, you can't simply walk in and set up shop. The colony's aggressive warriors would make short work of your miners. There is a solution: acclimation. The acclimation process takes time, but injury and loss of life (of both colony members and miners) can be minimized by letting the colony slowly become familiar and comfortable with your presence. Once your miners acquire the smell of the local kwama, the warriors will consider them to be part of the colony.\nEgg Harvesting: The actual \"mining\" of kwama eggs doesn't require a great deal of skill. Miners basically need only patience and common sense to perform their job. Egg harvesting must be done with an eye toward balance. Remove too many eggs and you may agitate the workers and the queen. Remove too few and the queen's egg production may fall. The mine manager must keep a careful eye on production to ensure that the queen does not produce too many or too few eggs. Wide swings in production will affect profits and make planning more difficult, and should be avoided.\nAvoid the queen's chamber at all times. Warriors and workers will view any approach to their queen as a threat and react accordingly. Production can grind to a halt as the colony becomes agitated and miners can't safely enter the mine. You might lose a few miners as the colony rampages, but the most important thing to remember is that the kwama will eventually calm down and once again accept the presence of the miners.\nNote: House Hlaalu egg-mining licenses require mines to provide regular production reports. Failure to comply can result in sanctions, fines, or even closure of the mine. And that's neither fun nor profitable."}

She is the strongest of the Sky spirits and is the deity of the heavens, the winds, the elements, and the unseen spirits of the air. Patron of sailors and travelers, Kynareth is invoked for auspicious stars at birth and for good fortune in daily life. In some legends, she is the first to agree to &lt;a href=\"Lorkhan\"&gt;Lorkhan&lt;/a&gt;'s plan to invent the mortal plane, and provides the space for its creation in the void. She is also associated with rain, a phenomenon said not to occur before the removal of Lorkhan's divine spark. She is often associated with Zenithar, as Zenithar's craftsmen use products provided by Kynareth's natural world. Thus, one cannot worship Zenithar without acknowledging the power of Kynareth.\nKynareth is the only one of the nine divines to not have a chapel dedicated to her in &lt;a href=\"Cyrodiil\"&gt;Cyrodiil&lt;/a&gt;, though she does have an altar to the west of the Imperial City. It should be noted that all of nature can be seen as Kynareth's chapel. Kynareth at one point had a champion by the name of Bourlor, whom she had blessed with arrows that would never miss their mark, though in some cases it would take years before the arrow finally hit the intended target.\nKynareth is the mother of the demigod &lt;a href=\"Morihaus\"&gt;Morihaus&lt;/a&gt;, who helped &lt;a href=\"Alessia\"&gt;Alessia&lt;/a&gt; drive the Ayleids from Cyrodiil and establish Nedic rule. Alessia supposedly communed directly with Kynareth during these events, and received visions from her concerning the coming of &lt;a href=\"Pelinal%20Whitestrake\"&gt;Pelinal Whitestrake&lt;/a&gt;. She later supposedly sent rain to wash away all the blood from Pelinal's campaigns against the elves.\nIn Skyrim, Kynareth is known as Kyne, and she is believed to be the wife of &lt;a href=\"Shor\"&gt;Shor&lt;/a&gt;. The &lt;a href=\"Throat%20of%20the%20World\"&gt;Throat of the World&lt;/a&gt; is considered to be her sacred mountain. She is also cited to have gifted the &lt;a href=\"Thu%27um\"&gt;Thu'um&lt;/a&gt; to the first Nord heroes by sending &lt;a href=\"Paarthurnax\"&gt;Paarthurnax&lt;/a&gt; to teach it to them, and is thus a central object of worship for &lt;a href=\"The%20Greybeards\"&gt;The Greybeards&lt;/a&gt; and their &lt;a href=\"Way%20of%20the%20Voice\"&gt;Way of the Voice&lt;/a&gt;. In the fourth era, many Nords have come to refer to her as Kynareth, and there is a temple of Kynareth in the city of Whiterun. the &lt;a href=\"Gildergreen\"&gt;Gildergreen&lt;/a&gt; is said to be sacred to Kynareth. However, there are still those in the countryside who refer to her by her traditional Nord name, and set others on the path to complete her sacred trials.\nIn &lt;a href=\"Elsweyr\"&gt;Elsweyr&lt;/a&gt;, Kynareth is known as Khenarthi. The Khajiiti creation myth states that she was part of &lt;a href=\"Ahnurr\"&gt;Ahnurr&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Fadomai\"&gt;Fadomai&lt;/a&gt;'s first litter. They gave her the sky, \"for what can fly higher than the wind?\". It is said that when &lt;a href=\"Lorkhaj\"&gt;Lorkhaj&lt;/a&gt; died, she hid herself into a storm until her brother &lt;a href=\"Alkosh\"&gt;Alkosh&lt;/a&gt; came and comforted her. The Khajiit believe that she is a messenger for &lt;a href=\"Azurah\"&gt;Azurah&lt;/a&gt;, and carries the souls of the dead to the &lt;a href=\"Sands%20Behind%20the%20Stars\"&gt;Sands Behind the Stars&lt;/a&gt;. This only applies to True Cats, though; &lt;a href=\"Bent%20Cats\"&gt;Bent Cats&lt;/a&gt; get dragged to the &lt;a href=\"Dark%20Behind%20the%20World\"&gt;Dark Behind the World&lt;/a&gt;. It is said that when Alkosh's body was scattered on the West Wind, Khenarthi found out and flew across the Many Paths to put Alkosh back together. It should be noted that Khenarthi is sometimes referred to as male, even though other &lt;a href=\"Tamriel\"&gt;Tamriel&lt;/a&gt;ic cultures tend to depict her as female.\nThe Yokudan version of Kynareth is known as Tava. She is said to have lead the Yokudans to &lt;a href=\"Herne%20%28Island%29\"&gt;Herne&lt;/a&gt; after the destruction of their home continent of &lt;a href=\"Yokuda\"&gt;Yokuda&lt;/a&gt;. She is worshipped by many sailors, and there are shrines to her in many of Hammerfell's port cities. She was a significant deity to the second wave of &lt;a href=\"Ra%20Gada\"&gt;Ra Gada&lt;/a&gt; settlers from Yokuda, who were named Tavans after her. Goshawks are sacred to Tava.\nArtifacts.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Lord%27s%20Mail\"&gt;Lord's Mail&lt;/a&gt; is said to be associated with Kynareth. It is said that whenever Kynareth deems the wearer unworthy, it will be taken away from them so that it can be found by a new hero. Some time before 3E 427, it was acquired by the Imperial Commission in &lt;a href=\"Ebonheart\"&gt;Ebonheart&lt;/a&gt;. It was stolen from there in 3E 427 by &lt;a href=\"Furius%20Acilius\"&gt;Furius Acilius&lt;/a&gt;, but the &lt;a href=\"Nerevarine\"&gt;Nerevarine&lt;/a&gt; retrieved it and returned it to the commission. \nThe &lt;a href=\"Boots%20of%20the%20Crusader\"&gt;Boots of the Crusader&lt;/a&gt; were Kynareth's gift to &lt;a href=\"Pelinal%20Whitestrake\"&gt;Pelinal Whitestrake&lt;/a&gt; for his fight against &lt;a href=\"Umaril%20the%20Unfeathered\"&gt;Umaril the Unfeathered&lt;/a&gt;. After his death, the Boots were lost to history until they turned up in &lt;a href=\"Kynareth%27s%20Grotto\"&gt;Kynareth's Grotto&lt;/a&gt;, where the &lt;a href=\"Divine%20Crusader\"&gt;Divine Crusader&lt;/a&gt; found them after proving themselves worthy by not fighting back against an attacking bear. Said crusader later used them to gain access to the &lt;a href=\"Mace%20of%20the%20Crusader\"&gt;Mace of the Crusader&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Ring%20of%20the%20Wind\"&gt;Ring of the Wind&lt;/a&gt; is another item that is said to be sacred to Kynareth. It was supposedly owned by an acrobat named Kisimba Spring-Snow, who always landed on her feet, except when she landed on the feet of others. In 3E 427, it was in the posession of a wizard named &lt;a href=\"Galmis%20Dren\"&gt;Galmis Dren&lt;/a&gt;. After receiving an assignment from the &lt;a href=\"Imperial%20Cult\"&gt;Imperial Cult&lt;/a&gt;, the Nerevarine slew Dren and took the ring for themselves.\nVerse.\n\"Come to me, Kynareth, for without you, I might not know the mysteries of the world, and so blind and in terror, I might consume and profane the abundance of your beautiful treasures.\""}

She is considered the widowed warrior-wife of the god &lt;a href=\"Shor\"&gt;Shor&lt;/a&gt; by the &lt;a href=\"Ancient%20Nordic%20Pantheon\"&gt;Ancient Nordic Pantheon&lt;/a&gt;, and is held in the highest esteem by &lt;a href=\"Atmoran\"&gt;Atmoran&lt;/a&gt; and Nord &lt;a href=\"hunter\"&gt;hunter&lt;/a&gt;s. It is believed by Nord tradition that Kyne leads souls to the afterlife of &lt;a href=\"Sovngarde%20%28Location%29\"&gt;Sovngarde&lt;/a&gt;, earning her the moniker of Kiss at the End. She has most commonly been referred to as &lt;a href=\"Kynareth\"&gt;Kynareth&lt;/a&gt;, her name in the &lt;a href=\"Imperial%20Pantheon\"&gt;Imperial Pantheon&lt;/a&gt;, since the end of the &lt;a href=\"Merethic%20Era\"&gt;Merethic Era&lt;/a&gt;.\nAncient lore.\nAccording to ancient &lt;a href=\"Nordic\"&gt;Nordic&lt;/a&gt; legends, the \"&lt;a href=\"Aldmeri%20Pantheon\"&gt;Elven Giants&lt;/a&gt;\", harboring bitterness against the god &lt;a href=\"Shor\"&gt;Shor&lt;/a&gt; for having created the mortal plane of &lt;a href=\"Nirn\"&gt;Nirn&lt;/a&gt;, conspired against Kyne's husband and brought about Shor's demise at the end of the &lt;a href=\"Dawn%20Era\"&gt;Dawn Era&lt;/a&gt;, dooming the god to the underworld. Storms and rainfall, natural phenomena associated with the goddess, are said to have first begun to occur after these legendary events.\nKyne is deemed the Mother of Men, as her breath upon the &lt;a href=\"Throat%20of%20the%20World\"&gt;Throat of the World&lt;/a&gt; is said to have formed the races of &lt;a href=\"Men\"&gt;Men&lt;/a&gt; from the remaining &lt;a href=\"Wandering%20Ehlnofey\"&gt;Wandering Ehlnofey&lt;/a&gt; at the end of the &lt;a href=\"Dawn%20Era\"&gt;Dawn Era&lt;/a&gt;. Together with her daughters, or together with &lt;a href=\"Paarthurnax\"&gt;Paarthurnax&lt;/a&gt;, she is believed to have bestowed upon the first Nords the gift of the &lt;a href=\"Thu%27um\"&gt;Thu'um&lt;/a&gt;, or Storm Voice, granting them the ability to wage &lt;a href=\"Dragon%20War\"&gt;war&lt;/a&gt; against &lt;a href=\"Alduin\"&gt;Alduin&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Dragons%20%28Lore%29\"&gt;Dragons&lt;/a&gt; in ancient times.\nIn Skyrim.\n&lt;a href=\"Kyne%27s%20Sacred%20Trials\"&gt;Kyne's Sacred Trials&lt;/a&gt;.\nAlthough she is uniformly known as &lt;a href=\"Kynareth\"&gt;Kynareth&lt;/a&gt; of the &lt;a href=\"Eight%20Divines\"&gt;Eight Divines&lt;/a&gt; by the &lt;a href=\"Fourth%20Era\"&gt;Fourth Era&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"Last%20Dragonborn\"&gt;Dragonborn&lt;/a&gt; learns that the goddess is still revered by her ancient name of Kyne among traditional &lt;a href=\"Nord\"&gt;Nord&lt;/a&gt;ic hunters, such as &lt;a href=\"Froki%20Whetted-Blade\"&gt;Froki Whetted-Blade&lt;/a&gt;. When questioned about his insistence on referring to his goddess as Kyne, the elderly woodsman states:\n\"Those sycophants in the Temple would call her Kynareth. Just a pale shadow of the truth, like all the Temple Divines. Kyne! Blessed Warrior-Wife. Shor's widow, sacred to any true Nord hunter. She's the mother of men and beasts, and her veil is the storm.\"\nThis dialogue will prompt Froki to offer the \"&lt;a href=\"Kyne%27s%20Sacred%20Trials\"&gt;Kyne's Sacred Trials&lt;/a&gt;\" quest, an ancient Nord hunting ritual:\n\"It's an old Nord Tradition, a test to prove your worth in the eyes of Kyne. Show that you're a hunter and no simple butcher. Kyne teaches us to respect the beasts and blesses the hunter who will face their champions. True Nord hunters are those who survive the Trials.\"\nCompleting the Trials will result in Froki bestowing &lt;a href=\"Kyne%27s%20Token\"&gt;Kyne's Token&lt;/a&gt; unto the Dragonborn.\n&lt;a href=\"The%20Horn%20of%20Jurgen%20Windcaller\"&gt;The Horn of Jurgen Windcaller&lt;/a&gt;.\nAt the conclusion of \"The Horn of Jurgen Windcaller\" quest, the &lt;a href=\"Greybeards\"&gt;Greybeards&lt;/a&gt; formally recognize the &lt;a href=\"Last%20Dragonborn\"&gt;Dovahkiin&lt;/a&gt; as being of the &lt;a href=\"Dragonborn%20%28Lore%29\"&gt;Dragonblood&lt;/a&gt;. In the greeting ceremony, the Greybeards utter the following words in the &lt;a href=\"Dragon%20Language\"&gt;Dragon Language&lt;/a&gt;:\n\"Long has the Storm Crown languished with no worthy brow to sit upon. By our breath we bestow it now to you in the name of Kyne, in the name of Shor, and in the name of Atmora of old. You are Ysmir now, Dragon of the North. Hearken to it.\"\n&lt;a href=\"Kyne%27s%20Peace\"&gt;Kyne's Peace&lt;/a&gt;.\nKyne's Peace is one of the &lt;a href=\"Dragon%20Shouts\"&gt;Dragon Shouts&lt;/a&gt; the Dragonborn can learn while journeying &lt;a href=\"Skyrim\"&gt;Skyrim&lt;/a&gt; and is notable for directly invoking the name of the goddess. The Dovahkiin articulates the full shout as \"Kaan Drem Ov\" (translating to \"Kyne Peace Trust\"). This Thu'um will cause nearby &lt;a href=\"Creatures%20%28Skyrim%29%23Animals\"&gt;wildlife&lt;/a&gt; to neither attack nor flee from the Dragonborn."}

At two words, the animals become less responsive to any attacks, taking another two or three hits before retaliating. At three words, animals become almost completely unresponsive to attacks.\nIt is a useful shout that should not be dismissed or overlooked. Without it, the &lt;a href=\"Last%20Dragonborn\"&gt;Dragonborn&lt;/a&gt; is forced to kill any aggressive wild animals they happen to cross paths within the wilderness unless they have the option of fleeing the scene. Even the first word alone is often enough to stop most attacks, subsequently giving them time to get away from the animal or animals. However, using this shout against, for example, &lt;a href=\"Wolf%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;wolves&lt;/a&gt; attacking the &lt;a href=\"Chicken%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;chickens&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Cow%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;cows&lt;/a&gt;, or people living at any of the homesteads will only temporarily solve the problem. This is so because the wolves (and other carnivores, presumably) will stay in the same general area they were in when they were shouted at, and once the shout wears off, they will resume their attacks on the homestead. This shout is best used against aggressive animals found on the plains or forests to stop their aggression long enough for the Dragonborn to make an escape. It can also be used to calm creatures that have been enthralled by &lt;a href=\"Spriggan%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;spriggans&lt;/a&gt;."}

Kynesgrove has a mine located north of the Inn called the &lt;a href=\"Steamscorch%20Mine\"&gt;Steamscorch Mine&lt;/a&gt; which houses &lt;a href=\"Malachite%20Ore\"&gt;Malachite Ore&lt;/a&gt;, a common ore used to make &lt;a href=\"Glass%20Armor\"&gt;Glass Armor&lt;/a&gt;, which is commonly used by &lt;a href=\"Altmer\"&gt;Altmer&lt;/a&gt; of the &lt;a href=\"Summerset%20Isles\"&gt;Summerset Isles&lt;/a&gt;. Kynesgrove is the home of the &lt;a href=\"Keepers%20of%20the%20Grove\"&gt;Keepers of the Grove&lt;/a&gt;, a group of Nordic priestess that guard the Kynesgrove Forest, seeing it as sacred grounds for Kyne of the &lt;a href=\"Nordic%20Pantheon\"&gt;Nordic Pantheon&lt;/a&gt;. An ancient &lt;a href=\"Dragon%20Mound\"&gt;Dragon Mound&lt;/a&gt; is located just north of the Inn, and it housed &lt;a href=\"Sahloknir\"&gt;Sahloknir&lt;/a&gt;, a &lt;a href=\"Dragons%20%28Lore%29\"&gt;Dragon&lt;/a&gt; from the days of &lt;a href=\"Alduin\"&gt;Alduin&lt;/a&gt;, the World Eater. The closest settlement to Kynesgrove is the city of &lt;a href=\"Windhelm\"&gt;Windhelm&lt;/a&gt; to the north, the town of &lt;a href=\"Lower%20Yorgrim\"&gt;Lower Yorgrim&lt;/a&gt; to the northeast, and the village of &lt;a href=\"Cragwallow\"&gt;Cragwallow&lt;/a&gt; to the southeast.\nHistory.\n&lt;a href=\"First%20Era\"&gt;First Era&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe dragon named &lt;a href=\"Sahloknir\"&gt;Sahloknir&lt;/a&gt; was slain by the legendary Nordic hero named &lt;a href=\"Jorg%20Helmbolg\"&gt;Jorg Helmbolg&lt;/a&gt; near the town of Kyne's Grove. His death was recorded by the &lt;a href=\"Dragonguard\"&gt;Dragonguard&lt;/a&gt;, the ancient Blades that resided in &lt;a href=\"Sky%20Haven%20Temple\"&gt;Sky Haven Temple&lt;/a&gt;, located deep within &lt;a href=\"West%20Skyrim\"&gt;West Skyrim&lt;/a&gt;. Sahloknir's death was among the many &lt;a href=\"Dragons%20%28Lore%29\"&gt;Dragons&lt;/a&gt; that did not die from the Dragonguard,\nbut instead, from a third-party.\n&lt;a href=\"Second%20Era\"&gt;Second Era&lt;/a&gt;.\nDuring the &lt;a href=\"Interregnum\"&gt;Interregnum&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"2E%20582\"&gt;2E 582&lt;/a&gt;, the forest of Kynesgrove was under the protection of the &lt;a href=\"Keepers%20of%20the%20Grove\"&gt;Keepers of the Grove&lt;/a&gt;, until a group of witches called the &lt;a href=\"Muzzled%20Owl%20Witches\"&gt;Muzzled Owl Witches&lt;/a&gt; took control of the forest. &lt;a href=\"Keeper%20Ormi\"&gt;Keeper Ormi&lt;/a&gt; was possessed by the witches and turned into a &lt;a href=\"Hagraven\"&gt;Hagraven&lt;/a&gt; through their foul magic. &lt;a href=\"Captain%20Alhana\"&gt;Captain Alhana&lt;/a&gt; decided to take charge to deal with the witches but was unable to defeat them. A traveler called the &lt;a href=\"Vestige\"&gt;Vestige&lt;/a&gt; intervened into the situation and beat the hagraven form of Ormi. Through her son's prayers, Ormi resorted back to her human form. Ebonheart Pact warriors would continue to come to Kynesgrove, for prayers before entering &lt;a href=\"Cyrodiil\"&gt;Cyrodiil&lt;/a&gt; and the war.\n&lt;a href=\"Fourth%20Era\"&gt;Fourth Era&lt;/a&gt;.\nDuring the &lt;a href=\"Skyrim%20Civil%20War\"&gt;Skyrim Civil War&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"4E%20201\"&gt;4E 201&lt;/a&gt;, the township of Kynesgrove was under the control of the city of &lt;a href=\"Windhelm\"&gt;Windhelm&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Stormcloaks\"&gt;Stormcloak Rebellion&lt;/a&gt;. The town was led by &lt;a href=\"Kjeld\"&gt;Kjeld&lt;/a&gt;, the innkeeper of &lt;a href=\"Braidwood%20Inn\"&gt;Braidwood Inn&lt;/a&gt;, the township was originally founded by the Uriel twins, &lt;a href=\"Gemma%20Uriel\"&gt;Gemma&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Ganna%20Uriel\"&gt;Ganna&lt;/a&gt;, who wanted the place to be lumber mill. This proved to be a failure when the learned that the forest is sacred to the people of &lt;a href=\"Eastmarch\"&gt;Eastmarch&lt;/a&gt;. The &lt;a href=\"Steamscorch%20Mine\"&gt;Steamscorch Mine&lt;/a&gt; was under the administration of &lt;a href=\"Dravynea%20the%20Stoneweaver\"&gt;Dravynea the Stoneweaver&lt;/a&gt;, a &lt;a href=\"Dunmer\"&gt;Dunmer&lt;/a&gt;i mage from &lt;a href=\"Morrowind\"&gt;Morrowind&lt;/a&gt;. The town provided Malachite for Windhelm.\nAround the same time, the &lt;a href=\"Dragon%20Crisis\"&gt;Dragon Crisis&lt;/a&gt; was ravaging the countryside, and the &lt;a href=\"Last%20Dragonborn\"&gt;Last Dragonborn&lt;/a&gt; began to arise, bringing hope across the province of Skyrim. The Dragonborn met a member of the long forgotten, &lt;a href=\"Blades\"&gt;Blades&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href=\"Delphine\"&gt;Delphine&lt;/a&gt; of the Blades wanted to have the Dragonborn prove themselves, to show that there, in fact, the Dragonborn. The dragon known as &lt;a href=\"Sahloknir\"&gt;Sahloknir&lt;/a&gt; was buried at the dragon mound and was revived by &lt;a href=\"Alduin\"&gt;Alduin&lt;/a&gt;, the World-Eater. The Dragonborn defeated Sahloknir and absorbed their soul, proving to Delphine that they were, in fact, the Last Dragonborn."}

There's whole forest down there- found a nice sword all laid out on some kind of monument and everything. But this is just strange. Eerie. What is this place? Not like any tomb I've ever seen.\nFrostmere Crypt, Week 16\nI think the cat's gone crazy. All of a sudden, he can't focus, keeps muttering to himself. He's gone from out best raider to our worst-botched two jobs just today. Eisa's trying to cover for him, but she's not fooling anyone.\nLately, he keeps asking to see my sword, begging to borrow it.

As a result, the Labyrinthian is perhaps the largest Nordic ruin in &lt;a href=\"Tamriel\"&gt;Tamriel&lt;/a&gt;. The ruins are enclosed within a mountain pass in the Nordic &lt;a href=\"Hold\"&gt;Hold&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"Hjaalmarch\"&gt;Hjaalmarch&lt;/a&gt;. The northern wall overlooks the rest of Hjaalmarch, with a view of the town of &lt;a href=\"Morthal\"&gt;Morthal&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Drajkmyr%20Marsh\"&gt;Drajkmyr Marsh&lt;/a&gt;. The southern end is an isolated road leading to the grasslands in &lt;a href=\"Whiterun%20Hold\"&gt;Whiterun Hold&lt;/a&gt;. The Labyrinthian holds various elements of the past, as well as memorabilia of the Dragon Cult. The center of Labyrinthian is a traditional circular ruin called the &lt;a href=\"Bromjunaar%20Sanctuary\"&gt;Bromjunaar Sanctuary&lt;/a&gt;, which has a statue that can hold &lt;a href=\"Dragon%20Priest%20Masks\"&gt;Dragon Priest Masks&lt;/a&gt; on display. The western portion of the ruins holds the inner ruins, which house much of the ruin's infrastructure and natural caverns. The only way into the inner ruins is with the &lt;a href=\"Torc%20of%20Labyrinthian\"&gt;Torc of Labyrinthian&lt;/a&gt;, which is a prized artifact of the &lt;a href=\"College%20of%20Winterhold\"&gt;College of Winterhold&lt;/a&gt;. The Inner Sanctum of the Labyrinthian contains untold numbers of &lt;a href=\"Skeleton\"&gt;skeletal&lt;/a&gt; warriors and even a &lt;a href=\"Skeletal%20Dragon\"&gt;Skeletal Dragon&lt;/a&gt;. Deeper into the ruins are various &lt;a href=\"Draugr\"&gt;Draugr&lt;/a&gt;s, ranging in power. The deepest part of the Labyrinthian is the Tribune, where &lt;a href=\"Morokei%20the%20Deathless\"&gt;Morokei the Deathless&lt;/a&gt; resides, as well as the &lt;a href=\"Staff%20of%20Magnus\"&gt;Staff of Magnus&lt;/a&gt;. Eventually, the inner ruins end, leading to a cave to the outside.\nThe eastern portion of the ruins is called the &lt;a href=\"Lost%20Valkygg\"&gt;Lost Valkygg&lt;/a&gt;, which is not particularly noteworthy. However, it was rumored to be the location of &lt;a href=\"Kahvozein%27s%20Fang\"&gt;Kahvozein's Fang&lt;/a&gt;, a dagger that is sharp enough to carve individual &lt;a href=\"Dragon%20Scales%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;dragon scales&lt;/a&gt;, making it a collectible among &lt;a href=\"Dragon%20Priests\"&gt;Dragon Priests&lt;/a&gt;. South of the Lost Valkygg is &lt;a href=\"Shalidor%27s%20Maze\"&gt;Shalidor's Maze&lt;/a&gt;, an extensive labyrinth that had given the Labyrinthian's namesake, as well as bringing it into modern-day myth. Shalidor's Maze can only be traversed by using the four out of the five schools of &lt;a href=\"magic\"&gt;magic&lt;/a&gt;. Deep into the maze are several secrets such as &lt;a href=\"Glamoril\"&gt;Glamoril&lt;/a&gt;, which supposedly gives the consumer immortality, having belonged to &lt;a href=\"Akatosh\"&gt;Akatosh&lt;/a&gt; before being in the maze. Beyond that, there is nothing else to the Labyrinthian nor the former city-state of Bromjunaar. What is also noteworthy is that trading caravans tend to use the Labyrinthian to move between Morthal and &lt;a href=\"Whiterun\"&gt;Whiterun&lt;/a&gt;, though they tend to avoid being attacked by &lt;a href=\"Frost%20Troll\"&gt;Frost Troll&lt;/a&gt;s.\nHistory.\n&lt;a href=\"Merethic%20Era\"&gt;Merethic Era&lt;/a&gt;.\nBromjunaar was established as a grand temple to the &lt;a href=\"Dragons%20%28Lore%29\"&gt;Dragons&lt;/a&gt; when the &lt;a href=\"Dragon%20Cult\"&gt;Dragon Cult&lt;/a&gt; had reigned across the province, but it was not called Bromjunaar by then. Eventually, the temple settlement grew into a city-state under the command of the Dragon Cult, called Bromjunaar. Bromjunaar became the capital of Skyrim, where the &lt;a href=\"Dragon%20Priests\"&gt;Dragon Priests&lt;/a&gt; would convene over matters throughout the domain. The Dragon Cult had a wide range that grew beyond the traditional borders of Skyrim. But when &lt;a href=\"Men\"&gt;Men&lt;/a&gt; rebelled against the Dragons, commencing the &lt;a href=\"Dragon%20War\"&gt;Dragon War&lt;/a&gt;, the Dragon Cult began to lose power and dissolve. It was here in Bromjunaar, the high-ranking Dragon Priests of the land had stored away &lt;a href=\"Konahrik%20%28Mask%29\"&gt;Konahrik&lt;/a&gt;, a powerful Dragon Priest mask of unknown origins, as of now. Bromjunaar had begun to crumble when the Dragon Cult was destroyed; the city ruins became a reminder of the Dragon Cult's totalitarian rule over Skyrim and the Nords.\n&lt;a href=\"First%20Era\"&gt;First Era&lt;/a&gt;.\nSometime in the first era, the city-state of &lt;a href=\"Whiterun\"&gt;Whiterun&lt;/a&gt; was under the rule of &lt;a href=\"Jarl%20Gjalund\"&gt;Jarl Gjalund&lt;/a&gt;. During his rule, the Whiterun Hold's borders were much larger, encompassing areas of the neighboring holds in &lt;a href=\"West%20Skyrim\"&gt;West Skyrim&lt;/a&gt; (i.e., &lt;a href=\"Falkreath%20Hold\"&gt;Falkreath Hold&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"The%20Pale\"&gt;The Pale&lt;/a&gt;). One of the settlements under Gjalund's control was Bromjunaar, which indicates that it lived out the days after the Dragon War. At this point, Bromjunaar was a humble village amidst the ruins, producing Lumber and Stone for Whiterun. Though soon enough, Bromjunaar was ultimately abandoned, leaving nothing to its original name. Nobody was able to take Konahrik's Mask and the inner ruins of Bromjunaar were left untouched. But the ruins would garner new popularity when &lt;a href=\"Shalidor\"&gt;Shalidor&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"Arch-Mage\"&gt;Arch-Mage&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"Winterhold%20%28City%29\"&gt;Winterhold&lt;/a&gt;, would visit Bromjunaar, using it as his playground.\nShalidor has many legends under his name which include creating Winterhold with a single whisper spell and battling the &lt;a href=\"Rourken%20Clan\"&gt;Rourken Clan&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;a href=\"Battle%20of%20Rourken-Shalidor\"&gt;Battle of Rourken-Shalidor&lt;/a&gt;. In an opening amidst the mountains, Shalidor created &lt;a href=\"Shalidor%27s%20Maze\"&gt;Shalidor's Maze&lt;/a&gt;, which is an extensive labyrinth that is used for training &lt;a href=\"Arch-Mage\"&gt;Arch-Mage&lt;/a&gt;s. Shalidor valued both academic knowledge and practical skills, but many candidates were unable to survive the maze. The maze is modeled after an hourglass and from face value, there is no way to leave the maze, unless you know four of the five schools of magic. As time went on, the Labyrinthian was no longer being used by Shalidor and it was ultimately abandoned. At one point, Shalidor had come across &lt;a href=\"Glamoril\"&gt;Glamoril&lt;/a&gt;, which is supposedly the secret of life. According to myth, he had stolen it from &lt;a href=\"Akatosh\"&gt;Akatosh&lt;/a&gt; and hid it deep in the Labyrinthian. This myth would eventually spread throughout the province, prompting to adventurers to explore it. &lt;a href=\"Kanen%20the%20Elder\"&gt;Kanen the Elder&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Mogrus%20the%20Dim\"&gt;Mogrus the Dim&lt;/a&gt; delved into the Labyrinthian to find Glamoril but died in the process. Both of their spirits were kept to guard Glamoril and have remained since then.\n&lt;a href=\"Third%20Era\"&gt;Third Era&lt;/a&gt;.\nDuring the &lt;a href=\"Imperial%20Simulacrum\"&gt;Imperial Simulacrum&lt;/a&gt; from &lt;a href=\"3E%20389\"&gt;3E 389&lt;/a&gt; to &lt;a href=\"3E%20399\"&gt;3E 399&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Emperor\"&gt;Emperor&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Uriel%20Septim%20VII\"&gt;Uriel Septim VII&lt;/a&gt; was imprisoned along with &lt;a href=\"Talin%20Warhaft\"&gt;Talin Warhaft&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;a href=\"Deadlands\"&gt;Deadlands&lt;/a&gt; by &lt;a href=\"Jagar%20Tharn\"&gt;Jagar Tharn&lt;/a&gt;. Tharn planned for months to capture the throne, and he was able to achieve so in ten years. Tharn had a powerful weapon called the &lt;a href=\"Staff%20of%20Chaos\"&gt;Staff of Chaos&lt;/a&gt;, and he split it into nine pieces and scattered them across Tamriel, the staff was the only thing keeping Uriel Septim and Warhaft in &lt;a href=\"Oblivion%20%28Realm%29\"&gt;Oblivion&lt;/a&gt;. A warrior escaped his clutches and traveled all corners of Tamriel to retrieve the missing pieces. The hero was known as the &lt;a href=\"Eternal%20Champion\"&gt;Eternal Champion&lt;/a&gt;, and he assembled the staff and defeated Jagar Tharn at the &lt;a href=\"Imperial%20Palace\"&gt;Imperial Palace&lt;/a&gt;. The Champion had at one point visited the ruins of the Labyrinthian in their quest to recover the pieces.\nThe Eternal Champion had retrieved the first piece of the staff from the ruins of &lt;a href=\"Fang%20Lair\"&gt;Fang Lair&lt;/a&gt;, continuing their quest throughout Tamriel. In their sleep, &lt;a href=\"Ria%20Silmane\"&gt;Ria Silmane&lt;/a&gt; came to the warrior through a dream, telling them where the next piece is, which was the ruins of the Labyrinthian in Skyrim. The Champion had then traveled to the city-state of &lt;a href=\"Winterhold%20%28City%29\"&gt;Winterhold&lt;/a&gt;, to get an idea of the Labyrinthian's location, and was directed to &lt;a href=\"Thelen%20Kaarn\"&gt;Thelen Kaarn&lt;/a&gt;, a wizard of the &lt;a href=\"Mages%20Guild\"&gt;Mages Guild&lt;/a&gt;. Before they were given the whereabouts of the Labyrinthian, the wizard gave the Champion a proposition: if they retrieved a tablet from defeating the &lt;a href=\"Fortress%20of%20Ice\"&gt;Fortress of Ice&lt;/a&gt;, he will give them what they need. And so, the Champion was able to get the coordinates for the Labyrinthian and retrieve the second piece of the Staff of Chaos. The Champion would then set their sites for the province of &lt;a href=\"Valenwood\"&gt;Valenwood&lt;/a&gt;. Because of the Champion's exploits, the Imperial loyalists would travel to the Labyrinthian, using it as a memorial for the hero and to retrace their steps.\n&lt;a href=\"Fourth%20Era\"&gt;Fourth Era&lt;/a&gt;.\nDuring the &lt;a href=\"Skyrim%20Civil%20War\"&gt;Skyrim Civil War&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"4E%20201\"&gt;4E 201&lt;/a&gt;, the Labyrinthian was said to be the location of the &lt;a href=\"Staff%20of%20Magnus\"&gt;Staff of Magnus&lt;/a&gt;, a powerful staff. At the &lt;a href=\"College%20of%20Winterhold\"&gt;College of Winterhold&lt;/a&gt;, an agent of the &lt;a href=\"Thalmor\"&gt;Thalmor&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Ancano\"&gt;Ancano&lt;/a&gt; had taken control of the &lt;a href=\"Eye%20of%20Magnus\"&gt;Eye of Magnus&lt;/a&gt;, killing &lt;a href=\"Arch-Mage%20Savos%20Aren\"&gt;Arch-Mage Savos Aren&lt;/a&gt; in the process. The Master Wizard of the College, &lt;a href=\"Mirabelle%20Ervine\"&gt;Mirabelle Ervine&lt;/a&gt; had sent an &lt;a href=\"Last%20Dragonborn\"&gt;esteemed student&lt;/a&gt; to find the Staff of Magnus in the Labyrinthian. The student delved into the Labyrinthian, experiencing afterimages of the late Arch-Mage, who had traversed the ruins many years ago. As they continue, &lt;a href=\"Morokei\"&gt;Morokei&lt;/a&gt; himself would commune with the student, draining their magic as they go deeper into the Labyrinthian. The afterimages of Savos' group were eventually dwindling as each of the ghostly students had passed away. At the end of the dungeon, Savos had left the two remaining mages to guard Morokei. The student was able to defeat the two ghostly guardians and Morokei the Deathless, obtaining the Staff of Magnus from the Dragon Priest. Before leaving, the student was encountered by &lt;a href=\"Estormo\"&gt;Estormo&lt;/a&gt;, who was an Agent of the Thalmor for Ancano. He was dealt with, and the student used the Staff to ultimately defeat Ancano."}

The first floor mainly holds &lt;a href=\"Spider%20%28Arena%29\"&gt;Spiders&lt;/a&gt;, along with &lt;a href=\"Wolf%20%28Arena%29\"&gt;Wolves&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Hell%20Hound\"&gt;Hell Hound&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"Snow%20Wolf%20%28Arena%29\"&gt;Snow Wolves&lt;/a&gt;, and two &lt;a href=\"Ghost%20%28Arena%29\"&gt;Ghosts&lt;/a&gt; guarding the \"secret of life.\" While the Labyrinthian was Shalidor's testing grounds, there seems to be no dedicated areas on the first floor to magic.\nThe first floor connects to the second by two stairwells on either side of the \"secret of life\"'s chamber. These stairwells lead to two separate rooms on the same floor, the Domains of Mogrus and Kanen.\nThe Domain of Mogrus is the first main section of the second floor, and is the physical and spiritual cage for brother Mogrus the Dim. The second floor appears to be the main \"testing grounds\" for the Labyrinthian, containing various rooms, albeit them empty. The Domain of Mogrus holds many &lt;a href=\"Ghoul\"&gt;Ghoul&lt;/a&gt;s, Ghosts, &lt;a href=\"Goblin%20%28Arena%29\"&gt;Goblins&lt;/a&gt;, Hell Hounds, and the newly introduced &lt;a href=\"Iron%20Golem\"&gt;Iron Golem&lt;/a&gt;s. Mogrus the Dim's cage sits at the far north-eastern corner of the domain, where Mogrus' &lt;a href=\"Keys%20%28Arena%29\"&gt;Diamond Key&lt;/a&gt; to unlock the \"secret of life\" sits.\nThe Domain of Kanen is the final section of the second floor, and is the physical and spiritual cage for brother Kanen the Wise. Kanen's domain holds the same creatures, it's only major differences lie in the various new tunnels and caverns dug into the floors and walls, along with the absence of magma. Kanen's cage sits at the far south-western portion of the domain, where the Sapphire Key sits with Kanen, which unlocks the final door into the \"secret of life.\"\nAt the time of &lt;a href=\"Eternal%20Champion\"&gt;Eternal Champion&lt;/a&gt;'s arrival in the &lt;a href=\"Third%20Era\"&gt;Third Era&lt;/a&gt;, on their journey to &lt;a href=\"Imperial%20Simulacrum\"&gt;rebuild&lt;/a&gt; the &lt;a href=\"Staff%20of%20Chaos\"&gt;Staff of Chaos&lt;/a&gt;, Shalidor's time had already long past. The Labyrinthian was home to various creatures, and still held the bodies of Mogrus the Dim and Kanen the Wise, trapped forever due to failing the riddles to the \"secret of life.\"\nHistory.\nThe Labyrinthian was originally the extensive testing grounds of Archmagus Shalidor, a Nordic mage, which he also used to guard the \"secret of life.\"\nAfter Shalidor's time, the Labyrinthian went largely unknown and forgotten. During a time of warring within Skyrim, two brothers, Mogrus the Dim and Kanen the Wise, went and successfully found the Labyrinthian, searching for the \"secret of life.\" They both failed, and became trapped in their own domains; sentenced to guard the \"secret of life\" for eternity, and according to Kanen, \"borne out of duty and love.\"\nAfter Mogrus and Kanen's time, the Labyrinthian again went forgotten, until it was sought again by the Mages Guild of Winterhold and the Eternal Champion of Tamriel in the &lt;a href=\"Imperial%20Simulacrum\"&gt;Third Era&lt;/a&gt;. The Champion successfully broke Mogrus and Kanen's binds, and broke the seals guarding the \"secret of life.\" Instead, this \"secret of life\" turned out to be the second piece to the Staff of Chaos, placed there by &lt;a href=\"Jagar%20Tharn%20%28Arena%29\"&gt;Jagar Tharn&lt;/a&gt; after his betrayal of the Emperor, &lt;a href=\"Uriel%20Septim%20VII\"&gt;Uriel Septim VII&lt;/a&gt;.\nQuests.\n&lt;a href=\"Labyrinthian%20%28Arena%20Quest%29\"&gt;Labyrinthian&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe second part to the third main quest of \"Arena\".

The Champion now must finish the second part in their ten year journey, and claim the second piece of the Staff of Chaos from the twisted corridors of &lt;a href=\"Archmagus\"&gt;Archmagus&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Shalidor\"&gt;Shalidor&lt;/a&gt;'s Labyrinthian.\nWalkthrough.\nPreparation.\nAfter returning &lt;a href=\"Thelen%20Kaarn\"&gt;Kaarn&lt;/a&gt;'s Tablet, and the celebratory events after, the Eternal Champion should proceed to the Labyrinthian. The Labyrinthian's main hold of difficulty comes from its confusing passageways from the main floor, and the Domains of Mogrus the Dim and Kanen the Elder.\nSimilar to the Champion's preparation with the &lt;a href=\"Fortress%20of%20Ice%20%28Quest%29\"&gt;Fortress of Ice&lt;/a&gt;, the Champion should buy better armor and weapons if possible. Weapons and armor should be repaired at a shop if damage is accumulated, along with more potions from the Mages Guild. The Champion, if they are a spellcaster, is encouraged to play around with spellmaking if they have the &lt;a href=\"Septim%20%28Coin%29\"&gt;Gold&lt;/a&gt;.\nIt is recommended for the Champion to continue buying &lt;a href=\"Potion%20of%20Healing%20%28Arena%29\"&gt;Potions of Healing&lt;/a&gt;/&lt;a href=\"Potion%20of%20Heal%20True\"&gt;Potions of Heal True&lt;/a&gt;, depending on their money situation, and to include a few &lt;a href=\"Potion%20of%20Fire%20Resist%20%28Arena%29\"&gt;Potions of Fire Resist&lt;/a&gt; as well, as there are &lt;a href=\"Hell%20Hound\"&gt;Hell Hound&lt;/a&gt;s and lava tunnels. It is easy to avoid the latter, though. When finished preparing, the Champion should traverse to the Labyrinthian.\nThe Dream Bridge.\nIt is possible, due to the chances of how achieving Jagar Tharn's dream bridge are rolled, that the Champion has not received a dream bridge from Tharn at any point during the escape from the Fang Lair, or the raiding of the Fortress of Ice. This is normal, due to the chances of each Staff of Chaos piece earned.\nDue to a fail-safe inside the game, if the Champion has not received a dream bridge from Tharn at any point in-between two Staff of Chaos dungeons, when traveling to the next dungeon for the first time\u2014in this case, to Labyrinthian from Fang Lair\u2014Tharn will forcibly dream bridge on the journey to the former.\nIt is recommended that the Champion, if they have not received a dream bridge yet from Tharn, prepare for an ambush at the entrance to the Labyrinthian. This also applies to latter dungeons: if the Champion did not achieve a dream bridge from Tharn after completing Labyrinthian, for example, they will be forced to have one on their way to the next Staff of Chaos dungeon, &lt;a href=\"Elden%20Grove%20%28Location%29\"&gt;Elden Grove&lt;/a&gt;.\nIf the Champion is comfortable in their current position, and are wary of Tharn if they had not received a dream bridge, they can proceed to the Labyrinthian.\nTwisted Corridors \u2013 Floor 1.\nThe Labyrinthian is located farther south-west than the &lt;a href=\"Fortress%20of%20Ice%20%28Location%29\"&gt;Fortress of Ice&lt;/a&gt; is, compared to Winterhold's location, the closest settlement being the town of &lt;a href=\"Stonehills%20%28Arena%29\"&gt;Stonehills&lt;/a&gt;.\nIn terms of size, the Labyrinthian is far larger and more complicated than the Fortress of Ice, and in-turn the &lt;a href=\"Fang%20Lair%20%28Arena%29\"&gt;Fang Lair&lt;/a&gt;. The two domains on the second floor, including the first floor, make up a very large and confusing dungeon, hence Labyrinthian being a labyrinth.\nThe Labyrinthian is the abandoned &lt;a href=\"Nord\"&gt;Nord&lt;/a&gt;ic testing grounds of Archmagus Shalidor, which is now home to many creatures, many of which have been already fought by the Eternal Champion, and some new, such as the towering &lt;a href=\"Iron%20Golem\"&gt;Iron Golem&lt;/a&gt;s, and the larger abundance of &lt;a href=\"Troll%20%28Arena%29\"&gt;Trolls&lt;/a&gt;. The main objective is to claim the second Staff of Chaos piece at the far north of the dungeon, in the first floor.\nWhen at the entrance hallway to the Labyrinthian, the Eternal Champion makes note of a message assumed to be carved in the wall:\n\"Proceed along the center path first, for the clues to solving the secrets of the Labyrinthian await there...\"\nAs implied, the Champion should disregard the other doors and continue along the central door's path. Thereso, they will be told the tale of two strife-weary brothers:\n\"This is the tale of two brothers,\"\n\"who sought the secret of life.\"\n\"They ventured into this Labyrinthian,\"\n\"weary from war and strife...\"\n\"The first was Kanen the Elder,\"\n\"a strong and cunning man.\"\n\"He quested for riches and jewels,\"\n\"yet found Fate had other plans...\"\n\"The second was Mogrus the Dim,\"\n\"and few knew what he was worth.\"\n\"They saw only the lumbering giant,\"\n\"not the child who was blessed at birth...\"\n\"The few they told of their plans,\"\n\"begged them to desist at their feet.\"\n\"But the brothers would test this puzzle of the North,\"\n\"for till then they had known no defeat...\"\n\"This is the tale of two brothers,\"\n\"who failed the secret of life.\"\n\"Forever held by two riddles which lead to the prize,\"\n\"and a wit as cunning, and sharp as a knife...\"\nThe tale talks of two brothers whom are still trapped inside the Labyrinthian for failing the riddle unlocking the \"secret of life,\" which is conveniently what the Champion must unlock to reach the second piece of the Staff of Chaos.\nFurther ahead, the Champion will enter a hallway with a locked door at the end. When approached, the Champion will make note of another carving:\n\"Mogrus the Dim, though he's a bore,\"\n\"Holds the only key that unlocks this door.\"\n\"To find the riddle, you must first find the son,\"\n\"Start your fateful search behind door number one...\"\nThe Champion should now head back to the entrance of the Labyrinthian, and head to the door on the left. When approaching, the Champion makes note of a message cut into the ground:\n\"Scratched in the ground here is the word,\"\n\"Door 2\"\nThis is where the Champion should not go. \"Door 2\" leads to the Domain of Kanen, with the Sapphire Key, and not Mogrus with the Diamond Key.\nThe Champion should proceed to the adjacent door, and enter the one where the Champion makes a note about the markings being \"Door 1.\" Once entered, the Champion should follow the provided map of the first floor. This will lead them on the right path to the second floor of the Domain of Mogrus.\nDomain of Mogrus \u2013 Floor 2.\nThe Domain of Mogrus is the first section of the second floor that the Champion should enter. The map adjacent has been modified to mark both the Diamond Key, and Mogrus the Dim. Mogrus' domain has magma embedded into the floor, in the western region. It is heavily advised to make use of the provided underground and above-ground passages.\nMogrus' domain also has various creatures, much tougher than was previewed in the Fortress of Ice. Those being Trolls, more Ghouls and Iron Golems, &lt;a href=\"Ghost%20%28Arena%29\"&gt;Ghosts&lt;/a&gt;, along with other random creatures that may spawn. The objective of being in Mogrus' domain is to get to the north-west portion, where the &lt;a href=\"Wraith%20%28Arena%29\"&gt;Spirit&lt;/a&gt; of Mogrus lies, whom is actually just a magical Wraith, locked in a cage for eternity.\nMogrus' Riddle.\nMogrus' chamber contains two doors, one being Mogrus' cage, where his red eyes glow and where he constantly moans, and one being the cage for the Diamond Key. While the Champion could simply bash open the door to the key, it is easier and less costly on the used weapon just to talk to Mogrus, especially considering how strong the door is, as it is a magically held lock.\nWhen approached, Mogrus will speak to the Champion, and present them a riddle that once halted him from acquiring the \"secret of life\":\n\"I am brother Mogrus, the shade of this hall,\"\n\"Cursed to its lengths, from beginning to end.\"\n\"Find me the answer, and a door will I call\"\n\"Fail me but once, and your heart will I rend...\"\n\"More beautiful than the face of your God,\"\n\"Yet more wicked than a Daemon's forked tongue?\"\n\"Dead men eat it all the time,\"\n\"Live men who eat it die slow...\"\n\"What is the answer, mortal?\"\nUnlike many of the other puzzles encountered thus far, Mogrus' puzzle only has one answer:\nAs Mogrus said, if the Champion fails, Mogrus will burst from his cage and try to kill the Champion for failing the question. If the puzzle is solved correctly, Mogrus' spirit is freed from the Labyrinthian's cage. He will proceed to talk to the Champion after:\n\"I have been a fool,\"\n\"Perhaps a mad wizard's tool.\"\n\"Yet after untold ages,\"\n\"I am at last free.\"\n\"In the cell next to this\"\n\"lies your reward, the Diamond Key...\"\nThe Champion should make their way back to the first floor now, and use the key to enter the first part of the uppermost chamber.\nAncient Puzzle.\nUsing the key on the first floor's main chamber door, the door will open and lead the way to a second door. When entering, the Champion will be attacked be two &lt;a href=\"Spider%20%28Arena%29\"&gt;Spiders&lt;/a&gt; at either ends of the doorway. The same is with the other side of the dungeon.\nWhen approaching the next door, the Champion makes note of another carving:\n\"Kanen the wise, holds more to be seen,\"\n\"a key and a riddle, and a test in between.\"\n\"To get past this portal, a feat done by few,\"\n\"search for the brother behind door number two...\"\nThe Champion should now head back to the Labyrinthian's entrance, and head through the left-most doorway marked \"Door 2.\"\nDomain of Kanen \u2013 Floor 2.\nThe Domain of Kanen is the second part to the Labyrinthian that the Champion should conquer. It is a step down in difficulty, and does not include magma, which makes it an easy task to best Kanen the Wise and escape. It is still heavily advised to make use of the provided underground and above-ground passages.\nIn this domain, the Spirit of Kanen is bound to the south-east most chamber. The objective is to get there, claim the Sapphire Key, and free Kanen just as Mogrus was.\nKanen's Riddle.\nKanen's chamber is very much similar to Mogrus', this chamber containing two doors, one cage holding the Sapphire Key and one binding Kanen the Wise to the Labyrinthian.\nWhen approached, Kanen will speak to the Champion as Mogrus did. Kanen will test the Champion with the riddle that prevented him from acquiring the \"secret of life\":\n\"I am the brother Kanen, who holds the secret of life.\"\n\"Not a more cunning riddler, 'twixt ocean and fief.\"\n\"Answer me this question, o' foolish mortal from above,\"\n\"or join my eternal task, borne of duty and love...\"\n\"Two bodies have I,\"\n\"Though both joined in one.\"\n\"The more still I stand,\"\n\"The quicker I run...\"\n\"What is thy answer?\"\nThis puzzle has two answers, though they are generally the same:\nWhen successfully answered, Kanen's spirit will be freed and he will open the cell door to the Sapphire Key, making one last remark:\n\"I am free to fly the wind,\"\n\"after an eternity of sickness and sin!\"\n\"As a reward for setting me free,\"\n\"The cell next to this holds your Sapphire Key...\"\nThe Champion should make their way back to the first floor, and use the key to enter the second and final part of the uppermost chamber.\nSecret of Life \u2013 Staff of Chaos.\nObtaining the Sapphire Key, the Champion should make their way back to the uppermost chamber, and use the key on the second door of the puzzle. Unlocking the door, the Champion should make their way to a third and final door in the puzzle.\nAfter approaching the third door, they will encounter a final puzzle:\n\"Here lies the final portal, the doorway to life...\"\n\"What force and strength\"\n\"cannot get through,\"\n\"I, with a gentle touch, can do;\"\n\"And many in these twisted halls would stand,\"\n\"Were I not, as a friend, at hand...\"\n\"Answer?\"\nJust like Kanen's riddle, while there are multiple answers, they are generally the same:\nIf failed, the door will give an indefinite amount of tries to complete the puzzle. When completed successfully, the door will speak to the Champion, and will open to two &lt;a href=\"Ghost%20%28Arena%29\"&gt;Ghosts&lt;/a&gt; guarding the Staff piece:\n\"Thou art truly worthy of Shalidor's prize, the second piece of the Staff of Chaos awaits...\"\nKilling the Ghosts, the second Staff Piece awaits: the first part of the base of the staff, floating over a pool of blood. Collecting it, the Eternal Champion notes the melding of the first and second piece of the staff:\n\"The second piece of the Staff of Chaos burns brightly with cold fire as it touches the first piece. They meld together perfectly...\"\nAfter this, the Champion should leave the Labyrinthian at once and sleep at an inn, to receive the congratulations from Ria Silmane..."}

The temple then grew to become the city of &lt;a href=\"Bromjunaar\"&gt;Bromjunaar&lt;/a&gt;, and it is theorized that the city may have been the capital of\u00a0&lt;a href=\"Skyrim\"&gt;Skyrim&lt;/a&gt;\u00a0during the height of the Dragon Cult's power and influence, though few historical records exist to verify this. There are, however, some historical records that prove that Bromjunaar was a center for the\u00a0&lt;a href=\"Dragon%20Priests%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Dragon Priests&lt;/a&gt;, and many of the highest ranking Dragon Priests met here to discuss important matters.\nDuring the &lt;a href=\"Dragon%20War\"&gt;Dragon War&lt;/a&gt;, the city went through drastic changes as the forces of the\u00a0&lt;a href=\"Dragons%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;dragons&lt;/a&gt; mobilized to fight against the people of &lt;a href=\"Tamriel\"&gt;Tamriel&lt;/a&gt; who were rebelling against them. After the war ended, the city was abandoned and it fell into ruin.\nFirst Era.\nThe name \"Labyrinthian\" comes from the &lt;a href=\"Shalidor%27s%20Maze\"&gt;labyrinth&lt;/a&gt; which Arch-Mage &lt;a href=\"Shalidor\"&gt;Shalidor&lt;/a&gt; constructed inside the ruins of Bromjunaar during the &lt;a href=\"First%20Era\"&gt;First Era&lt;/a&gt; to test new Archmages, as he stood at the forefront of a movement to enact higher standards among mages and to discourage magicka usage among the common castes. The name Labyrinthian eventually became synonymous with Bromjunaar and, after some time, the ruins were known as such.\nThird Era.\nAt some point between &lt;a href=\"3E%20389\"&gt;3E 389&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"3E%20399\"&gt;3E 399&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"Eternal%20Champion\"&gt;Eternal Champion&lt;/a&gt; retrieved a piece of the &lt;a href=\"Staff%20of%20Chaos\"&gt;Staff of Chaos&lt;/a&gt; from the Labyrinthian to defeat &lt;a href=\"Imperial%20Battlemage\"&gt;Imperial Battlemage&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Jagar%20Tharn\"&gt;Jagar Tharn&lt;/a&gt;.\nFourth Era.\nIn the &lt;a href=\"Fourth%20Era\"&gt;Fourth Era&lt;/a&gt;, the city of Labyrinthian was but a memory. Like most ancient Atmoran cities in &lt;a href=\"Skyrim\"&gt;Skyrim&lt;/a&gt;, it had been abandoned and fell into ruin as people migrated and spread across the country. Occasionally, trading caravans will pass through Labyrinthian, but will usually take safer, longer routes due to the freezing cold, snow, wind, and frost trolls in Labyrinthian and across the mountains.\nBefore becoming &lt;a href=\"Arch-Mage\"&gt;Arch-Mage&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Savos%20Aren\"&gt;Savos Aren&lt;/a&gt; joined an expedition to Labyrinthian. Led by the Arch-Mage's favorite student, &lt;a href=\"Atmah\"&gt;Atmah&lt;/a&gt;, a group of mages ventured into the ruins, searching for the &lt;a href=\"Staff%20of%20Magnus%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Staff of Magnus&lt;/a&gt; and various other items believed to be within. &lt;a href=\"Shalidor%27s%20Insights%20%28Book%29\"&gt;Shalidor's writings&lt;/a&gt; are specifically mentioned as a hoped-for find by Savos, although they are not found in the passages. Accompanying Savos and Atmah were their fellow mages &lt;a href=\"Takes-In-Light\"&gt;Takes-In-Light&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Hafnar%20Ice-Fist\"&gt;Hafnar Ice-Fist&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Girduin\"&gt;Girduin&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Elvali%20Veren\"&gt;Elvali Veren&lt;/a&gt;. Half of the group perished in the ruins. The other three reached the final chamber, where they encountered the ancient Dragon Priest &lt;a href=\"Morokei%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Morokei&lt;/a&gt;. Desperate to contain the evil power of the Dragon Priest, Savos killed his two remaining companions and raised them as ghostly thralls, who remained in the chamber to maintain a magical containment ward to prevent Morokei from ever escaping.\nMany years later, the &lt;a href=\"Last%20Dragonborn\"&gt;Dragonborn&lt;/a&gt; visits Labyrinthian and follows in this group's footsteps in order to obtain the Staff of Magnus, needed to stop the machinations of &lt;a href=\"Ancano%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Ancano&lt;/a&gt; back at the College of Winterhold. The Dragonborn kills the two ghostly thralls in order to destroy Morokei and obtain the staff.\nDesign and features.\nThis is a very large area composed of many sub-levels, all of which are worth exploring. Upon entering this area, the Dragonborn is greeted by several frost trolls.\nLabyrinthian Chasm.\nWhile going through the Labyrinthian Chasm, several elemental doors are found; ice and fire. While going through this part of the ruin, a voice speaks to the Dragonborn.\nIce door.\nThe first elemental door is the ice door, which is guarded by a Frost Spirit. Upon defeating the spirit, a spell involving fire is required to continue.\nFire door.\nThe second elemental door is the fire door, which is guarded by a Fire Spirit. A frost spell is required to open the door.\nBromjunaar Sanctuary.\nIn the center, there is a large, raised circular area, similar in appearance to the many &lt;a href=\"Dragon%20Burial%20Mounds\"&gt;Dragon Burial Mounds&lt;/a&gt; found throughout Skyrim. Beneath this is a strange ruined altar, where can be found a skeleton, the &lt;a href=\"Wooden%20Mask\"&gt;Wooden Mask&lt;/a&gt;, and a &lt;a href=\"Hired%20Thug%27s%20Missive\"&gt;thug's missive&lt;/a&gt;. Equipping the Wooden Mask will transport the Dragonborn back to a time when they will find a series of busts in the place of the strange altar. In this time and place, the Dragonborn can place each of the &lt;a href=\"Dragon%20Priest%20Masks%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Dragon Priests' masks&lt;/a&gt; found throughout Skyrim on the altar. When all eight masks are in place, the dragon's mouth opens, and a ninth mask is revealed: &lt;a href=\"Konahrik\"&gt;Konahrik&lt;/a&gt;.\nShalidor's Maze.\nThere is also a door named &lt;a href=\"Shalidor%27s%20Maze\"&gt;Shalidor's Maze&lt;/a&gt;, just behind the location. This leads to the maze of the same name, which is home to one &lt;a href=\"daedra\"&gt;daedra&lt;/a&gt;.\nUpon passing through the door, the next area is a courtyard with a corpse in a circle and the maze just beyond. Approach the corpse, and four &lt;a href=\"Staves%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;staves&lt;/a&gt; rise from the ground; one for &lt;a href=\"Destruction%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Destruction&lt;/a&gt;, one for &lt;a href=\"Alteration%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Alteration&lt;/a&gt;, one for &lt;a href=\"Illusion%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Illusion&lt;/a&gt;, and one for &lt;a href=\"Restoration%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Restoration&lt;/a&gt;. Taking the staves is optional, because if the Dragonborn already knows the staves' corresponding spells, the maze can be completed without having to take the staves.\nContinuing straight, a Sigil of Alteration is on the wall at the very entrance. Using the &lt;a href=\"Staff%20of%20Magelight\"&gt;Staff of Magelight&lt;/a&gt; on the sigil will cause the gate to the right to open. Continuing through the maze, there are &lt;a href=\"Skeever%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;skeevers&lt;/a&gt; along the way. Many corners of the maze feature \"shutters\" which contain random loot, one containing a &lt;a href=\"Spell%20Tomes%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;spell tome&lt;/a&gt; for &lt;a href=\"Heal%20Other\"&gt;Heal Other&lt;/a&gt;. Next will be a similar Sigil of Destruction. Using the &lt;a href=\"Staff%20of%20Fireballs\"&gt;Staff of Fireballs&lt;/a&gt; will open the trapdoor below. Right and up a staircase, to the left side of the maze, then north, (right, if at the top of the staircase), is a word wall for the dragon shout &lt;a href=\"Dismay\"&gt;Dismay&lt;/a&gt;.\nFrom here, turning around and looking south reveals another side of the maze, which is sealed with a Sigil of Illusion. The &lt;a href=\"Staff%20of%20Fear\"&gt;Staff of Fear&lt;/a&gt; will open it. Continuing on as last time, this time killing off an &lt;a href=\"Ice%20Wraith%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;ice wraith&lt;/a&gt;, at the end, the Sigil of Restoration is displayed. The &lt;a href=\"Staff%20of%20Repulsion\"&gt;Staff of Repulsion&lt;/a&gt; will open another trap door.\nAfter falling, there will be a large blue globe shimmering in the passageway. This is the portal to fight a &lt;a href=\"Dremora%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;dremora&lt;/a&gt; of leveled rank and name. He will conjure two &lt;a href=\"atronach\"&gt;atronach&lt;/a&gt;s. If he is killed before everyone teleports back to Labyrinthian, the Dragonborn and the atronachs will be teleported out, but not the body of the dremora. The dremora carries the &lt;a href=\"Diadem%20of%20the%20Savant\"&gt;Diadem of the Savant&lt;/a&gt;, a &lt;a href=\"circlet\"&gt;circlet&lt;/a&gt; which reduces &lt;a href=\"Magicka%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;magicka&lt;/a&gt; cost for all classes of &lt;a href=\"Spells%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;spells&lt;/a&gt;.\nLost Valkygg.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Lost%20Valkygg\"&gt;Lost Valkygg&lt;/a&gt; is a tunnel based dungeon. It is heavily guarded by &lt;a href=\"Draugr%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;draugr&lt;/a&gt;. They pop out of coffins in most places, but some roam freely. This area has many &lt;a href=\"Precious%20Gems%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;gemstones&lt;/a&gt;, but other than that, there is little loot except what the draugr have on them.\nEnter through the door which is at the base of the in-ground stairs, as opposed to the door set into the wall face; that is the exit. The area just beyond the entrance door is not overly dangerous, although several draugr may be encountered. Two draugr are lying on a stone slab, which can be killed before they have a chance to rise and attack. Go through the door activated by pressure pads and follow the hallway to a larger room. Fight the four draugr here, then pass through a wooden door. To the left is an apprentice-level locked door to &lt;a href=\"Lockpick%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;pick&lt;/a&gt;; avoid the pressure pad just before the door, as it activates a poison dart trap. Beyond the locked door is a &lt;a href=\"steel%20horned%20helmet\"&gt;steel horned helmet&lt;/a&gt; and two &lt;a href=\"Containers%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;burial urns&lt;/a&gt; to loot. Exit this small room and proceed in the opposite direction.\nA &lt;a href=\"Draugr%20Deathlord%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Draugr Deathlord&lt;/a&gt; guards a chest in the next room, near a fairly deep hole. It may use &lt;a href=\"Unrelenting%20Force%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Unrelenting Force&lt;/a&gt; to knock the Dragonborn into this hole. Once the Deathlord is defeated, enter the room behind it to find a chest. Drop down the hole, landing on the beams partway down to avoid injury, and at the bottom do battle with another Draugr Deathlord. These two Deathlords carry randomized &lt;a href=\"Ebony%20Weapons%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;ebony weapons&lt;/a&gt;, making it possible to obtain powerful weapons, including the &lt;a href=\"Ebony%20Bow%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;ebony bow&lt;/a&gt; at relatively low levels.\nCeremonial Door.\nThis door is only opened during the College of Winterhold's quest to find the &lt;a href=\"Staff%20of%20Magnus%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Staff of Magnus&lt;/a&gt;. The &lt;a href=\"Torc%20of%20Labyrinthian\"&gt;Torc of Labyrinthian&lt;/a&gt; must first be received from &lt;a href=\"Mirabelle%20Ervine\"&gt;Mirabelle Ervine&lt;/a&gt;. Upon arrival, activate the Ceremonial Door and the Torc will be applied, opening the lock and allowing entry.\nA &lt;a href=\"Skeletal%20Dragon%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Skeletal Dragon&lt;/a&gt; rests just inside here, along with many skeletons. These may be fought, or the Dragonborn may sneak or sprint past them to get to the next room. The skeletal dragon is only a reanimated skeleton, so the Dragonborn is unable to absorb its &lt;a href=\"Dragon%20Soul\"&gt;soul&lt;/a&gt;; however, once it has been defeated, it may be looted for five &lt;a href=\"Dragon%20Bone%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;dragon bones&lt;/a&gt;. The Dragonborn must continue to make their way through the lost city from here, occasionally seeing the ghosts of Savos Aren and his companions, as they work to complete the quest \"&lt;a href=\"The%20Staff%20of%20Magnus%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;The Staff of Magnus&lt;/a&gt;.\"\nNotable items.\n&lt;a href=\"Shalidor%27s%20Maze\"&gt;Shalidor's Maze&lt;/a&gt;.\nWhile fighting the Dremora, the combatants will be transported back to the entrance of the area, where two &lt;a href=\"atronach\"&gt;atronach&lt;/a&gt;s spawn. Each one drops its respective salt (&lt;a href=\"Frost%20Salts%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Frost Salts&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Void%20Salts%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Void Salts&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"Fire%20Salts%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Fire Salts&lt;/a&gt;)."}

However, his inventory never resets or regenerates, so he keeps every item sold to him.\nDeath.\nEarly in the &lt;a href=\"Fourth%20Era\"&gt;Fourth Era&lt;/a&gt;, Sinderion met a traveler who sold him his first sample of &lt;a href=\"Crimson%20Nirnroot%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;crimson nirnroot&lt;/a&gt;, and he learned from the traveler of the location where more could be found; the &lt;a href=\"Dwemer\"&gt;Dwemer&lt;/a&gt; city of &lt;a href=\"Blackreach\"&gt;Blackreach&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Skyrim\"&gt;Skyrim&lt;/a&gt;. Packing up his belongings, he traveled there and established a starting base at a farm of one of his old apprentices, &lt;a href=\"Avrusa%20Sarethi\"&gt;Avrusa Sarethi&lt;/a&gt;. After some time, he traveled to Blackreach to collect the crimson nirnroot, &lt;a href=\"Sinderion%27s%20Field%20Laboratory\"&gt;staying&lt;/a&gt; in a Dwarven house in Blackreach, but was killed by the denizens there, after only obtaining one sample for his research.

The trilling sound this strange herb emits seems to taunt me, to push me even harder to discover its secrets. Even after a generous and indomitable traveler became a field collector in my stead, and provided me with five score of the nirnroot, I was only able to muster what I consider a mediocre alchemical creation at best. This only served to strengthen my hunger and whet my appetite for the solution.\nIt wasn't until over fifty years later that the answer to my prayers was carried into my basement workshop at the &lt;a href=\"West%20Weald%20Inn\"&gt;West Weald Inn&lt;/a&gt;. The first thing I heard was the familiar tone - that unmistakable warble unique to the nirnroot. But when I turned around, my heart leapt and a chill ran down my spine. This was indeed a nirnroot, but of a variety the likes of which I have never seen. The herb was awash in a spectacular array of red hues, each leaf seemingly emblazoned with innumerable variations of crimson. I couldn't move - I was completely transfixed. Never in my wildest dreams could I have imagined a species of nirnroot with such a unique property.\nAfter an awkward silence, I finally managed to stammer out a few questions to the traveler who'd brought me this treasure. He told me his name was &lt;a href=\"Obeth%20Arnesian\"&gt;Obeth Arnesian&lt;/a&gt;, a treasure-seeker from Skyrim. Apparently, he'd been exploring a vast subterranean network of grand caverns called &lt;a href=\"Blackreach%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Blackreach&lt;/a&gt; and had stumbled across what he dismissed as \"a noisy red weed.\" His expedition was largely unsuccessful and he didn't want to leave the caves empty-handed, so Obeth picked one of the crimson nirnroot to bring home. He said that it took some time, but eventually he was pointed my way and that perhaps I'd pay a fair price for it.\nBefore I could gather my wits and ask anything else, Obeth offered to sell me the crimson nirnroot sample, a map showing me how to find Blackreach and the strange &lt;a href=\"Attunement%20Sphere\"&gt;key&lt;/a&gt; needed to breach its outer defenses. It took me mere moments to decide. Obeth left &lt;a href=\"Skingrad%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;Skingrad&lt;/a&gt; a thousand septims richer, but I would have easily paid ten times that amount to obtain the sample alone.\nIt took a year of planning, but I was able to pack up and sell my workshop and make my way into Skyrim. Before delving headfirst into Blackreach, I knew I needed to set up a new laboratory, but wished to do so in seclusion. After making inquiries at the College of Winterhold, of which I was an honorary member, I was directed to speak to Avrusa Sarethi, a student of botanical alchemy who had a small farm near the city of Riften. By bartering my knowledge of nirnroot cultivation, I was able to secure Sarethi Farm as a launching point for my field research. I kept the knowledge of the crimson nirnroot a secret from Avrusa, but imparted everything else I knew to her in exchange for her hospitality.\nA few months passed, but I was finally ready to enter Blackreach. I used the &lt;a href=\"Attunement%20Sphere\"&gt;Attunement Sphere&lt;/a&gt; that Obeth had provided and descended into the depths. My goal was to gather enough crimson nirnroot to produce my greatest alchemical creation to date - I was certain it would take at least thirty of them to provide the necessary catalyst.\nThis brings me to the present. My initial research seems to indicate that the crimson nirnroot has a similar affinity for moisture as the garden variety, but also maintains some sort of symbiotic relationship with the enormous fungi that inhabits Blackreach. It's my guess that the fungi itself is a source of water, absorbing it from the moist subterranean air like a sponge. This provides the ideal environment for the nirnroot to grow. Unfortunately, the crimson nirnroot appears to have a vastly shortened lifespan, and they are in no way plentiful down here. Gathering thirty of them will be quite the challenge, but hopefully the &lt;a href=\"Falmer%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;denizens&lt;/a&gt; of Blackreach will allow me to gather my samples unhindered."}

Sinding was in Falkreath because he was looking for a giant beast roaming the wilds around the village. If he killed this beast, the &lt;a href=\"Daedric%20Princes\"&gt;Daedric Lord&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Hircine\"&gt;Hircine&lt;/a&gt; would lift his curse.\n&lt;a href=\"Ill%20Met%20by%20Moonlight\"&gt;Ill Met by Moonlight&lt;/a&gt;.\nDuring the quest, the &lt;a href=\"Last%20Dragonborn\"&gt;Dragonborn&lt;/a&gt; receives the &lt;a href=\"Hircine%27s%20Ring%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Ring of Hircine&lt;/a&gt; from Sinding, which causes the wearer to sporadically transform into a werewolf. When walking away from his cell, a glance backwards will show a werewolf ripping off the bars from the roof, and &lt;a href=\"Hold%20Guard\"&gt;guards&lt;/a&gt; will ask the Dragonborn about him escaping upon leaving the barracks. Killing the transformed Sinding and taking his skin is necessary to obtain the &lt;a href=\"Savior%27s%20Hide%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Savior's Hide&lt;/a&gt; from Hircine and to remove the Ring of Hircine. Alternatively, Sinding can be spared and the hunters killed, which removes the curse from the Ring of Hircine and allows &lt;a href=\"lycanthropes\"&gt;lycanthropes&lt;/a&gt; to use it to transform as many times as desired.\nIf spared, it seems Sinding is ultimately unable to control his beast blood. If the option to spare Sinding is taken, even if the Dragonborn turned around and killed him as well to complete the quest both ways, he can appear later in a random encounter as a hostile werewolf fighting a guard from the local hold.

Guilbert will actually be angry with them for trying to call his father a thief.\nKeeping the blade for themselves.\nOne also have the option to keep the blade for themselves, which may be useful for lower leveled Heroes due to the fact that it does not weigh anything, and it is not enchanted, meaning it can be repaired by themselves without being a Journeyman armorer."}

He is a well known customer of the local &lt;a href=\"Sadrith%20Mora%20Mages%20Guild\"&gt;Mages Guild&lt;/a&gt; where he has &lt;a href=\"Sinyaramen%27s%20Potion\"&gt;custom potions&lt;/a&gt; made. He dons extravagant &lt;a href=\"Clothing%20%28Morrowind%29\"&gt;clothing&lt;/a&gt; and wears a recognizable crested ring. Sometimes people such as &lt;a href=\"Iniel\"&gt;Iniel&lt;/a&gt; recall seeing the ring rather than the man himself. Sinyaramen occasionally has information that can be useful to the &lt;a href=\"Nerevarine\"&gt;Nerevarine&lt;/a&gt;, but he may need incentives to share what he knows. He does not offer any wares for sale.\nPersonality.\nSinyaramen enjoys fraternizing with his fellow Altmers, who are rarely seen in Sadrith Mora. He will take the time to introduce himself to any High Elves who he sees passing through town. He has a strong distaste for &lt;a href=\"Vampire%20%28Morrowind%29\"&gt;vampires&lt;/a&gt;, stemming from his grandfather's death at the hands of &lt;a href=\"Kjeld%20%28Morrowind%29\"&gt;Kjeld&lt;/a&gt; and the mistaken belief that his great grandparents were killed by vampires as well.\nInteractions.\n&lt;a href=\"Blood%20Ties\"&gt;Blood Ties&lt;/a&gt;.\nWhile attempting to determine the fate of vampire &lt;a href=\"Dhaunayne%20Aundae\"&gt;Dhaunayne Aundae's&lt;/a&gt; son, the Nerevarine speaks with &lt;a href=\"Tusamircil\"&gt;Tusamircil&lt;/a&gt; at the Sadrith Mora Mages Guild, who recognizes Aundae's signet ring as being identical to Sinyaramen's. Tusamircil gives the Nerevarine an order of potions to deliver as an incentive to get Sinyaramen talking. After some coaxing, he reveals that the ring belonged to his grandfather.\nThe Nerevarine discovers that Sinyaramen's grandfather and Dhaunayne's son are one and the same. The son of the &lt;a href=\"Clan%20Aundae\"&gt;Aundae Clan's&lt;/a&gt; leader had grown up to become a vampire hunter, under the mistaken belief that his mother was killed by a vampire rather than had become one. He later died while performing his duties, slaughtered by a vampire by the name of Kjeld. The Nerevarine does not reveal to Sinyaramen that his great grandmother is alive and is in fact a vampire herself, however his words ultimately result in Dhaunayne ordering Kjeld's death.\n&lt;a href=\"Pledge%20from%20Canctunian%20Ponius\"&gt;Pledge from Canctunian Ponius&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe Nerevarine encounters Sinyaramen while in pursuit of a High Elf trader who embezzled a few thousand gold from the &lt;a href=\"East%20Empire%20Company\"&gt;East Empire Company&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Ebonheart%20%28Morrowind%29\"&gt;Ebonheart&lt;/a&gt;. Members of the Sadrith Mora Mages Guild suggest inquiring with Sinyaramen, since both men are Altmer traders, a rarity in the region. Although he doesn't know exactly where to look, Sinyaramen has a useful idea about how to locate &lt;a href=\"Mossanon\"&gt;Mossanon&lt;/a&gt;. He suggests questioning the locals about a female &lt;a href=\"House%20Telvanni\"&gt;Telvanni&lt;/a&gt; who has been seen accompanying a male High Elf around town.\nAttributes.\nSinyaramen is skilled in a variety of fields, but is not particularly adept at any of them. His strongest skills include &lt;a href=\"Mercantile%20%28Morrowind%29\"&gt;mercantile&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Speechcraft%20%28Morrowind%29\"&gt;speechcraft&lt;/a&gt;, as is common among traders, however he is merely a novice at both. He is schooled in the magical art of &lt;a href=\"Mysticism%20%28Morrowind%29\"&gt;mysticism&lt;/a&gt;, as well as being proficient in &lt;a href=\"Sneak%20%28Morrowind%29\"&gt;sneak&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Security%20%28Morrowind%29\"&gt;security&lt;/a&gt;. Sinyaramen is equally skilled in all five of his primary skills, and is 28 in his preferred weapon type, &lt;a href=\"Blunt%20Weapon%20%28Morrowind%29\"&gt;Blunt Weapon&lt;/a&gt;.\nCombat.\nSinyaramen is a coward when confronted in battle. He initially draws his &lt;a href=\"Iron%20Mace%20%28Morrowind%29\"&gt;iron mace&lt;/a&gt; to muster a defense, but quickly flees as he cries for help. It is only when his fellow tavern patrons come to his aid and the Nerevarine is severely outnumbered that he will tempt his fate in battle. He may call upon his repertoire of &lt;a href=\"Dispel%20%28Morrowind%29\"&gt;dispel&lt;/a&gt; spells to remove negative magical effects from himself, or positive effects from his opponents.\nDialogue.\n\"I will not speak with your kind, vampire.\"\nAfter being sent to track down the trader accused of embezzling gold:\nMossanon \"A High Elf named Mossanon? Yes. I saw a High Elf in the market and introduced myself. He was with a local Telvanni woman -- I don't recall her name. I have seen them around several times since, but they both seemed a bit shy and quiet -- and quite taken with one another -- so I didn't intrude. Perhaps you might ask the ladies of the town. A Dark Elven woman with a High Elven friend might excite comment.\""}

My failure.\nIn the immediate sense, this is no doubt obvious. If you are reading this, you are probably standing over my body, slain in the depths of the Shrine of the Crusader. Perhaps the gods granted me the gift of at least glimpsing the holy Helm before I died, undeserving though I am. I must believe that you are indeed a holy knight, following in my footsteps in quest of the &lt;a href=\"Crusader%27s%20Relics\"&gt;Crusader's Relics&lt;/a&gt;. It is to you, Sir Knight of my hopes, that I direct these words. May the account of my failures help you avoid my fate.\nKnow that my failures encompass far more than my own death (which is of little account, at the end of a long life). The high ideals of the &lt;a href=\"Knights%20of%20the%20Nine%20%28Faction%29\"&gt;Knights of the Nine&lt;/a&gt;, of service to the gods rather than men, of dedication to a higher purpose -- these are my failures, as I shall record here.\nAs I write this, the scratching of my pen the only sound in the empty &lt;a href=\"Priory%20of%20the%20Nine%20%28Location%29\"&gt;Priory&lt;/a&gt;, I am preparing to embark on my last quest for the Helm of the Crusader. I know that my chance of success is small. I am too old for such a task. This quest should have been taken up by the next generation of Knights of the Nine, while &lt;a href=\"Sir%20Caius\"&gt;Sir Caius&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Sir%20Berich\"&gt;Sir Berich&lt;/a&gt; and the rest of us stayed behind and spun tales of our days of glory. Alas, there is no next generation. Sir Berich is my embittered enemy, the rest of my old companions are all dead. There is only me, the last stubborn Knight of a Failed Order.\nFor many years I blamed Sir Berich for the dissolution of the Order, but in my old age I have finally come to recognize my own part in those tragic events. I now believe that the seeds of our destruction were sown early, although the fruit did not ripen until late. Even in the first heady days, questing for the Cuirass with Sir Caius and &lt;a href=\"Sir%20Torolf\"&gt;Sir Torolf&lt;/a&gt;, I set the pattern of personal glory. The Cuirass was mine, and although it resided in the Priory, I wore it into battle and accepted the acclaim of my fellows and the people for its recovery. And so it went. The Sword and Greaves recovered of Sir Berich, became his personal arms, and the Gauntlets of &lt;a href=\"Sir%20Casimir\"&gt;Sir Casimir&lt;/a&gt;. Why not? Should the holy weapons lie idle while there was evil to be vanquished? And who more fitting to carry them than the knight who had proved himself worthy by their recovery? So we told ourselves -- so I told myself -- but all that followed flowed from this.\nWhen Sir Berich wanted to take his Relics with him to the war, who was I to forbid him? I, who had jealously considered the Cuirass my own and none other's? Sir Berich was wrong, but I was wrong first, and the blame for the dispute over the Relics falls first on me, the leader and founder of the Knights, who should have set a higher example, but was instead first to claim a Relic for my own.\nSir Berich's later actions I will leave for others to judge. But let it be known that I do not blame him for the dissolution of the Knights. If he would speak to me, I would tell him so myself. He and I are now all that are left of the original Knights. The others are all dead, and I have dedicated myself to recovering their bodies and interring them in the Priory Undercroft, as is fitting for such holy warriors. Alas that they did not have the leader they deserved.\nNow it is time for me to depart on my quest for the &lt;a href=\"Helm%20of%20the%20Crusader\"&gt;Helm&lt;/a&gt;. If you would follow in my footsteps, Sir Knight, know that the Priory basement, at least, will remain inviolate, I have sealed the stairs and only my ring will now open it. My brother knights will sleep in peace, in company with the Cuirass, the only Relic that remains in the Order's keeping. I say that, although the Order is officially dissolved, hoping and believing that the Knights of the Nine will one day be reborn.\nPerhaps you are the one to restore the Order. If so, go to the Priory in the &lt;a href=\"West%20Weald%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;West Weald&lt;/a&gt;. Use my ring to enter the vaults beneath the Priory House. There you will find the Cuirass, and claim it for your own if you are a true knight.\nMay the Nine guard and guide you. Farewell.\nSir Amiel\nPriory of the Nine\n&lt;a href=\"The%20West%20Weald\"&gt;The West Weald&lt;/a&gt;\nCounty Skingrad\nYear &lt;a href=\"3E%20153\"&gt;153&lt;/a&gt; of the Septim Era"}

While leaving he was stopped by &lt;a href=\"Sir%20Caius\"&gt;Sir Caius&lt;/a&gt; who argued with Amiel about not taking the sword into battle. Berich then baited Caius knowing he would draw his weapon, when he did Berich cut him down on the &lt;a href=\"Priory%20of%20the%20Nine%20%28Location%29\"&gt;Priory&lt;/a&gt; steps. He then left for the war and became a darker person.\nAfter the war.\nIn &lt;a href=\"3E%20127\"&gt;3E 127&lt;/a&gt;, Berich returned a war hero, becoming an important figure in the empire. At this point he had little love for his own comrades, most of who by this point either died in the war or in search of relics, or had left the dying order.\nIt is unclear what happened afterwards, what is known is that he grew into a dark and angry person, full of hatred and spite, this anger held him even after death and bound him to this world.\nFate.\nAs a &lt;a href=\"Lord%20Berich%20Vlindrel\"&gt;wraith&lt;/a&gt;, he not only became evil, but he corrupted the holy sword while the greaves simply became a reminder of his old life. His name itself was forgotten and replaced by the rumors and legends of him haunting the &lt;a href=\"Orange%20Road\"&gt;Orange Road&lt;/a&gt;.\nThese rumors brought &lt;a href=\"Sir%20Roderic\"&gt;Sir Roderic&lt;/a&gt; and his squire &lt;a href=\"Lathon\"&gt;Lathon&lt;/a&gt; to his hideout in &lt;a href=\"Underpall%20Cave%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;Underpall Cave&lt;/a&gt; in the hopes of freeing the relics and the soul of the lost knight. Berich killed Sir Roderic who held him off while Lathon escaped with the greaves.\nLathon returned later with the new &lt;a href=\"Knight%20Commander\"&gt;Knight Commander&lt;/a&gt; to again attempt to get the sword. After a great battle the Knight Commander struck a killing blow on Berich.\nBerich is seen by the commander later in the undercroft of the &lt;a href=\"Priory%20of%20the%20Nine%20%28Location%29\"&gt;Priory of the Nine&lt;/a&gt;, freed from his anger and spite.

{"id": "1583", "revid": "26213507", "url": "https://elderscrolls.fandom.com/wiki?curid=1583", "title": "Sithis", "text": "Sithis, also known as SITHISIT, Psijii, the Dread-Father, the Original Creator, and sometimes &lt;a href=\"Padomay\"&gt;Padomay&lt;/a&gt;, is a deity representative of emptiness and the &lt;a href=\"Void\"&gt;Void&lt;/a&gt;. Other sources say that he is also a representation of utter misanthropy. He is worshipped by the &lt;a href=\"Dark%20Brotherhood\"&gt;Dark Brotherhood&lt;/a&gt; and many other cults. \nBackground.\nSithis is neither an &lt;a href=\"Aedra\"&gt;Aedra&lt;/a&gt; nor a &lt;a href=\"Daedra\"&gt;Daedra&lt;/a&gt;. Sithis is the birthed soul incarnate of &lt;a href=\"Padomay\"&gt;Padomay&lt;/a&gt; and the equal yet opposite force to &lt;a href=\"Anui-El\"&gt;Anui-El&lt;/a&gt;, who is the birthed soul incarnate of Padomay's opposite force, &lt;a href=\"Anu\"&gt;Anu&lt;/a&gt;. The conditions Sithis and Anui-El placed on each other in their interplay would bring about the creation of what is known as the &lt;a href=\"Aurbis\"&gt;Aurbis&lt;/a&gt;, in which the realms of &lt;a href=\"Aetherius\"&gt;Aetherius&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Oblivion%20%28Realm%29\"&gt;Oblivion&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Mundus\"&gt;Mundus&lt;/a&gt; would form. Sithis is regarded as the one who initiated his interplay with Anui-El, and for that he is held in high esteem. When Anui-El birthed his soul, &lt;a href=\"Auri-El\"&gt;Auri-El&lt;/a&gt;, to stabilize the then confusing and turbulent Aurbis by creating time, Sithis birthed his own soul, &lt;a href=\"Lorkhan\"&gt;Lorkhan&lt;/a&gt;, as well. Sithis is believed to have created &lt;a href=\"Lorkhan\"&gt;Lorkhan&lt;/a&gt; to destroy the universe through trickery and deceit, and return the universe to the Void.\nPopular opinion and worship.\nAccording to some sources, the name \"Sithis\" is actually a corruption of the term \"Psijii\" which is derived from the prevailing concept of PSJJJJ, that being Padomay. Some believe that Sithis was actually born when a cult of nihilistic, &lt;a href=\"Mephala\"&gt;Mephala&lt;/a&gt; worshiping, &lt;a href=\"Chimer\"&gt;Chimer&lt;/a&gt; merged Daedric influences with the essence of Padomay. This concept of Sithis eventually evolved into a cult that wished to \"murder the world.\"\nThe worship of Sithis is rejected by most cultures, most likely because of his association with death. During the &lt;a href=\"First%20Era\"&gt;First&lt;/a&gt; and early &lt;a href=\"Second%20Era\"&gt;Second Era&lt;/a&gt;s, little is known about the worship of Sithis. However, the Dark Brotherhood, which formed sometime during the Second Era by the Night Mother, became the main known cult dedicated to the worship of Sithis. The &lt;a href=\"Crimson%20Scars\"&gt;Crimson Scars&lt;/a&gt;, an all-vampire group of assassins, worships Sithis as well. Additionally, some of the &lt;a href=\"Argonian\"&gt;Argonian&lt;/a&gt; culture revolves around Sithis. Though the main religious figure within the Argonian Pantheon is the &lt;a href=\"Hist\"&gt;Hist&lt;/a&gt;, the Hist as well as the Argonians accept Sithis as the original creator. In fact, Argonians born under the sign of &lt;a href=\"The%20Shadow\"&gt;The Shadow&lt;/a&gt; are given to the Dark Brotherhood at birth, where they are trained as assassins and spies such that one day they may earn the rank of &lt;a href=\"Shadowscale\"&gt;Shadowscale&lt;/a&gt; and serve Argonia and Sithis. &lt;a href=\"Vampires\"&gt;Vampires&lt;/a&gt; have been known to worship Sithis as well, with many claiming allegiance to the Crimson Scars or the Dark Brotherhood. Vampires that are not a part of these organizations will often worship either &lt;a href=\"Molag%20Bal\"&gt;Molag Bal&lt;/a&gt;, one of the &lt;a href=\"Daedric%20Princes\"&gt;Daedric Princes&lt;/a&gt;, or Sithis instead of the &lt;a href=\"Nine%20Divines\"&gt;Nine Divines&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href=\"Mortal\"&gt;Mortal&lt;/a&gt;s often represent Sithis as a skeletal being, to signify His relationship to death. In truth, the Dread Lord is formless, and infinite as the Void.\nSithis, in the eyes of the &lt;a href=\"Altmer\"&gt;Altmer&lt;/a&gt;, is nothing but an embodiment of all the limitations Anui-El used to ponder himself after his creation. But according to Sithis worshipers, Anuiel was actually one of many ideas created by Sithis that refused to die and enslaved the universe. Sithis is described as the embodiment of everything evil, but at the same time, he is described as being nothing at all: a Void. He is appeased through death (although he himself is not a god of death) and other acts of suffering and strife.\nIn the belief of the Dark Brotherhood, Sithis visited a &lt;a href=\"Dunmer\"&gt;Dunmer&lt;/a&gt; woman who gave birth to five children of Sithis. The Dunmer woman then claimed to hear the voice of Sithis in her head, telling her to send their children to him. However this could not be achieved easily, so she sacrificed her five children, thus sending them to the Void to reunite with their father. Following this, many angry citizens killed the Dunmer lady for her actions and burnt down her house. It is said that this action created the &lt;a href=\"Night%20Mother\"&gt;Night Mother&lt;/a&gt;. At least 30 years after this, a man heard voices in his head, much like the Night Mother heard Sithis. He followed the voices to her tomb and it was there the first &lt;a href=\"Listener\"&gt;Listener&lt;/a&gt; of the Dark Brotherhood was created. Following this and the establishment of the Dark Brotherhood that worships Sithis, he became much more publicly worshiped throughout all of &lt;a href=\"Tamriel\"&gt;Tamriel&lt;/a&gt; than he was before. The Dark Brotherhood believe that Sithis is \"married\" to The Night Mother, and the Dark Brotherhood are their metaphorical children. According to some sources, the Night Mother may actually be the Daedric Prince &lt;a href=\"Mephala\"&gt;Mephala&lt;/a&gt;.\nTheories.\nAccording to the book \"&lt;a href=\"Sithis%20%28Book%29\"&gt;Sithis&lt;/a&gt;\", Anu is described as not being a deity of any kind, but is rather a static force without consciousness, personality, or intent or will, being depicted as immutable static light that does not change. It is Sithis, according to this book, that created all things. Sithis is said to have sundered the Eternal Anu to create new ideas. However, Sithis unintentionally created &lt;a href=\"Anui-El\"&gt;Anui-El&lt;/a&gt; who became &lt;a href=\"Aetherius\"&gt;Aetherius&lt;/a&gt; and the Aedra. Sithis then created &lt;a href=\"Lorkhan\"&gt;Lorkhan&lt;/a&gt; (which the book describes as neither Aedra nor Daedra) to destroy these \"false\" creations. The book greatly downplays any involvement by Anu and differs from the other known documentation detailing the origins of the worlds, as such its validity is questionable considering that the book was written by worshipers of Sithis.\nInteractions with mortals.\n&lt;a href=\"Second%20Era\"&gt;Second Era&lt;/a&gt;.\nSometime after the assassination of Potentate &lt;a href=\"Versidue%20Shaie\"&gt;Versidue Shaie&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"2E%20324\"&gt;2E 324&lt;/a&gt;, Sithis came to the &lt;a href=\"Night%20Mother\"&gt;Night Mother&lt;/a&gt; in a village on the future site of &lt;a href=\"Bravil\"&gt;Bravil&lt;/a&gt;. He visited her in her bed chamber, and begat to her five children. After two years passed, the Night Mother killed her children and sent them to the Void to be with their father.\nIn &lt;a href=\"2E%20582\"&gt;2E 582&lt;/a&gt;, a being claiming to be an &lt;a href=\"aspect%20of%20Sithis\"&gt;aspect of Sithis&lt;/a&gt; appeared to the &lt;a href=\"Vestige\"&gt;Vestige&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Shadowfen\"&gt;Shadowfen&lt;/a&gt; during the Three Banners War. After reclaiming the Fangs of Sithis from Khajiiti pirates, if the Vestige refuses to hand them over to a group of &lt;a href=\"Shadowscale\"&gt;Shadowscale&lt;/a&gt; assassins, a being in the shape of a large red serpent will appear. It claimed to be a \"minuscule piece of Sithis, a jolt of intellect and will, contained within this shadowed form.\" The Vestige must then hand over a Fang, but the \"Aspect of Sithis\" allowed them to keep the other, believing the relics had been too long hidden away from the world.\nLater on during the war, a defected Dark Brotherhood member known as &lt;a href=\"The%20Black%20Dragon%20%28Online%29\"&gt;The Black Dragon&lt;/a&gt; retreated to &lt;a href=\"Knightsgrave\"&gt;Knightsgrave&lt;/a&gt;, awaiting the Vestige and Shadowscale &lt;a href=\"Green-Venom-Tongue\"&gt;Green-Venom-Tongue&lt;/a&gt;. Sithis assisted the two assassins by sending out a &lt;a href=\"Wrath%20of%20Sithis\"&gt;Wrath of Sithis&lt;/a&gt;, and in his dying moments after being struck by the Black Dragon's blade, Green-Venom-Tongue believed that Sithis too was hunting the Dragon. Once the Black Dragon was killed, the Wrath of Sithis shackled her soul and brought her to the Void."}

Before him was nothing, but the foolish &lt;a href=\"Altmer\"&gt;Altmer&lt;/a&gt; have names for and revere this nothing. That is because they are lazy slaves. Indeed, from the &lt;a href=\"36%20Lessons%20of%20Vivec%2C%20Sermon%2010\"&gt;Sermons&lt;/a&gt;, 'stasis asks merely for itself, which is nothing.'\nSithis sundered the nothing and mutated the parts, fashioning from them a myriad of possibilities. These ideas ebbed and flowed and faded away and this is how it should have been.\nOne idea, however, became jealous and did not want to die; like the stasis, he wanted to last. This was the demon &lt;a href=\"Anui-El\"&gt;Anui-El&lt;/a&gt;, who made friends, and they called themselves the &lt;a href=\"Aedra\"&gt;Aedra&lt;/a&gt;.

Unstable mutant! \nLorkhan had found the Aedric weakness. While each rebel was, by their nature, immeasurable, they were, through jealously and vanity, also separate from each other. They were also unwilling to go back to the nothing of before. So while they ruled their false dominions, Lorkhan filled the void with a myriad of new ideas. These ideas were legion. Soon it seemed that Lorkhan had a dominion of his own, with slaves and everlasting imperfections, and he seemed, for all the world, like an Aedra. Thus did he present himself as such to the demon Anui-El and the &lt;a href=\"Eight%20Divines\"&gt;Eight Givers&lt;/a&gt;: as a friend.\nGo unto the Sharmat &lt;a href=\"Dagoth%20Ur%20%28Character%29\"&gt;Dagoth Ur&lt;/a&gt; as a friend.\n&lt;a href=\"AE\"&gt;AE&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Herma%20Mora\"&gt;HERMA MORA&lt;/a&gt; ALTADOON &lt;a href=\"Padomay\"&gt;PADHOME&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Lorkhan\"&gt;LKHAN&lt;/a&gt; AE AI."}
