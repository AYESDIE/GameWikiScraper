The lack of racial variation in skeletons may be explained by time restraints or a simple oversight by &lt;a href=\"Bethesda%20Softworks\"&gt;Bethesda Softworks&lt;/a&gt;. The tails of &lt;a href=\"Argonians%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;Argonians&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Khajiit%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;Khajiit&lt;/a&gt;, or the massive physical structure of &lt;a href=\"Orsimer%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;Orc&lt;/a&gt; does not appear in undead.\nMarksman training.\nSkeletons make excellent targets for &lt;a href=\"Marksman%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;Marksman&lt;/a&gt; due to their lack of fleshy parts; all &lt;a href=\"Arrows%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;arrows&lt;/a&gt; fired at them still do normal &lt;a href=\"Damage%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;damage&lt;/a&gt;, but will ricochet off of the skeleton's &lt;a href=\"Bone%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;bones&lt;/a&gt;, falling to the ground. Once the skeleton is defeated, every arrow that fired can be retrieved from the ground. The only chance of losing an arrow is if it falls to an unreachable place or fades out normally.\nSpecial abilities.\nOne type of skeleton, Skeleton Champion, has the power to &lt;a href=\"summon%20Skeleton\"&gt;summon Skeleton&lt;/a&gt; Guardian. The Champion only appears to be able to summon once though, so once his minion skeleton is defeated the Champion will not summon another minion."}

They wear little to no armor, and wield &lt;a href=\"Ancient%20Nord%20weapons\"&gt;Ancient Nord weapons&lt;/a&gt;. Skeletons have no apparent will of their own, and are mainly employed by warlocks as bodyguards and sentinels to protect ancient ruins, temples, and other places of magic worship. When defeated, they immediately fall apart in a heap of bones, and the lights in their eye sockets go out.\nWith the add-on, a few new variants of skeleton appear, and sometimes take the place of other skeletons found in the dungeons of Skyrim, such as &lt;a href=\"Volkihar%20Dungeons\"&gt;Volkihar Dungeons&lt;/a&gt;. These new skeletons wear varied amounts of &lt;a href=\"Ancient%20Nord%20Armor\"&gt;Ancient Nord Armor&lt;/a&gt;, ranging from simply boots and cuirass to a full set, and can take more damage than their more fragile counterparts. Others wear black hoods and cast ice-based &lt;a href=\"Destruction%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;destruction&lt;/a&gt; spells in one hand while wielding a sword or war axe in the other. Some of these new variants don't fall apart when slain, simply falling over when killed. While they carry slightly more loot, including gold and jewelry, their armor cannot be looted.\nTactics.\nBy themselves, skeletons are quite weak even at lower levels, having a low health pool and wielding low-tier weapons. They can be taken out with a few quick hits by any weapon or spells, with &lt;a href=\"Fire%20Damage%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;fire&lt;/a&gt;-based magic doing the most damage, just like most other undead creatures. They have little tactical skill, either running straight towards the nearest known enemy to attack them head-on or firing arrows and spells from a distance. However, they are almost never found alone\u2014skeletons are mostly found in groups, typically no less than three. Outside of Nordic ruins, &lt;a href=\"Necromancer%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;necromancers&lt;/a&gt; are often found with a few skeleton minions, who will fight alongside their master. If a skeleton is slain before the necromancer is, the necromancer can sometimes re-summon them via magic.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Bloodskal%20Blade\"&gt;Bloodskal Blade&lt;/a&gt; is a highly effective weapon against skeletons. One energy blast from the blade's special power attack is often enough to defeat multiple skeletons, especially the standard varieties. A good tactic against multiple skeletons is to lure them into a narrow corridor and then do a power attack. The energy blast should hit all of them and destroy them almost instantly."}

(e.g. To fortify Alchemy,\u00a0Conjuration, and Mysticism, they will need to fortify Intelligence.\u00a0This will increase the amount of Magicka the Hero has at their\u00a0disposal).\u00a0One way to help level-up in this area is to\u00a0cast a Drain \"skill\" spell (such as Drain: Block), because armor exp is determined by how many times the armor/shield is hit, therefore lower level with stronger armor (&lt;a href=\"Daedric%20Armor%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;Daedric&lt;/a&gt; is best)\u00a0they get\u00a0more experience, but costs loads of hammers to fix the armor.\u00a0With Heavy/Light Armor/Block skills experience\u00a0is determined on the amount of damage\u00a0The Hero\u00a0takes and endures, just make sure\u00a0to have a decent heal spell\u00a0that can be cast almost constantly.\u00a0One option\u00a0is to\u00a0head into a goblin cave and find a\u00a0pen of rats\u00a0and let them attack you. If\u00a0they are\u00a0wearing half Heavy Armor and half Light Armor\u00a0they will\u00a0gain good experience from both.\u00a0Also, if\u00a0they can be hit by multiple enemies at the same time, more experience will be gained from\u00a0each group\u00a0of hits.\u00a0\nAlteration and Security are both also better if\u00a0they use a\u00a0Drain: Skill spell.\u00a0For security it is better to get the &lt;a href=\"Skeleton%20Key%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;Skeleton Key&lt;/a&gt; as it never breaks, drain Security to\u00a00 and\u00a0it will take many attempts to open the lock.\u00a0They will raise experience quicker for illusion by\u00a0finding a high leveled lock, (such as a very hard lock),\u00a0use a Drain: Alteration spell then cast Open Very Easy Lock' spell on it. The bigger the difference in the spell and lock, the more experience that will be received\u00a0and the\u00a0lock will never open.\u00a0This process can be repeated\u00a0constantly until level 100.\nTo quickly boost\u00a0skills\u00a0train with a trainer for 5 levels in a skill, (granted you have the money), sleep and repeat. After waking up, fortify the Attribute that governs the skill(s)\u00a0that\u00a0need to be boosted, and try leveling a few more times in another major skill with the tips below. When\u00a0the Hero reaches the maximum amount that can be trained at the current level (e.g. Bosmer level 5), simply fall asleep and repeat. This can be easier when leveling with magic skills by\u00a0without a trainer\u00a0while having lots of Potions of Sorcery or\u00a0&lt;a href=\"Welkynd%20Stone%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;Welkynd Stone&lt;/a&gt;.\nMagic Arts.\nAs experience is not based on the level or cost of the spell cast, one should cast the cheapest spell in the school possible as rapidly as possible if they want to level the skill as quickly as possible. Holding block increases casting speed considerably. Access to the &lt;a href=\"Arcane%20University%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;Arcane University&lt;/a&gt; or having the spellmaking altar activated at the &lt;a href=\"Wizard%27s%20Tower\"&gt;Wizard's Tower&lt;/a&gt; will allow you to create the cheapest possible spells, reducing or eliminating your need to cease casting to regenerate magicka.\n&lt;a href=\"Restoration%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;Restoration&lt;/a&gt;.\n\"Note: using multiple colleges in one spell will only level the dominant effect. E.g., if your spell has a Turn Undead icon, the school that will level up will be Conjuration.\""}

Because the forces being manipulated by Mysticism are dangerous and unknown, the spell effects are purposefully specific. They include &lt;a href=\"Far%20Silence%20%28Daggerfall%29\"&gt;Far Silence&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Soul%20Trap%20%28Daggerfall%29\"&gt;Soul Trap&lt;/a&gt; among many others. Buying, creating, and casting spells of mysticism are less expensive for mages skilled in this experimental path.\nThe School of Restoration.\nRestoration is devoted to the salubrious and soothing powers of Magicka, evident in spells like &lt;a href=\"Cure%20Poison%20%28Daggerfall%29\"&gt;cure poison&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Troll%27s%20Blood%20%28Daggerfall%29\"&gt;Troll's Blood&lt;/a&gt;. Buying, creating, and casting &lt;a href=\"Spells%20%28Daggerfall%29\"&gt;Spell&lt;/a&gt; devised to heal a target are less expensive for mages of this path.\nThe School of Thaumaturgy.\nThaumaturgy concentrates on exposing or manipulating known forces and objects within their natural laws. It is evident in Spells like Levitation and Detection. No Thaumaturgical spell can permanently change the appearance or structure of a force or object. Buying, creating, and casting spells of thaumaturgy are less expensive for mages skilled in this path. This skill also exists in .\nThe School of Illusion.\nIllusion works with magicka in its capacity to camouflage, illuminate, or obscure without changing an object's structure. &lt;a href=\"Invisibility%20%28Daggerfall%29\"&gt;Invisibility&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Light%20%28Daggerfall%29\"&gt;Light&lt;/a&gt; are two of the School's most basic spells. Buying, creating, and casting a spell of illumination are less expensive for mages skilled in this path.\nThe School of Destruction.\nThe School is concerned with the purely destructive capabilities of Magicka evident in spells like &lt;a href=\"Fireball%20%28Daggerfall%29\"&gt;Fireball&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Acidic%20Field\"&gt;Acidic Field&lt;/a&gt;. Buying, creating, and casting &lt;a href=\"Spells%20%28Daggerfall%29\"&gt;spell&lt;/a&gt; devised to harm or destroy a target is less expensive for mages skilled in this path.\nThe School of Alteration.\nThe School concerns itself with magicka's ability to change, often radically, the structure and composition of any object. Unlike the School of Illusion, Alteration deals with actual change, not the appearance of it. &lt;a href=\"Slowfalling\"&gt;Slowfalling&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Shield%20%28Daggerfall%29\"&gt;Shield&lt;/a&gt; are two classic spells of the School of Alteration.

Each skill is placed in one of three specializations: Combat, Magic, or Stealth. And each skill is paired with a &lt;a href=\"Attributes%20%28Morrowind%29\"&gt;primary attribute&lt;/a&gt; that affects the chance of successfully using the skill. Increasing skill in \"Morrowind\" increases the effectiveness in using the skill itself (i.e. points in Armorer lead to improved ability to repair armor), or in using spells associated with that skill (i.e. points in Conjuration improves effectiveness of Conjuration spells).\nThere are a total of twenty-seven skills available in Morrowind. Each character class has five major skills, five minor skills, and the remainder seventeen count as miscellaneous skills. Raising a skill will allow for an increase in the paired attribute as each level is obtained.\nSkills are divided into three specializations: Combat, Magic, and Stealth.\nSpecialization.\nDuring the character creation process, it is possible to choose one of the three categories of specialization: combat, magic, or stealth. Characters receive +5 to all skills of their specialization, which is applied to the starting skill level. All skills which fall under the specialization will also be easier to increase.\nMajor vs. minor vs. \"misc\".\nIn Morrowind, if a skill is listed as major, minor, or miscellaneous, they will play a role in how fast a character level is gained and how much an attribute can increase. Only by raising skills in the major and minor section can a level be gained. Each time 10 skill points are gained, in any of the major and minor skills, a message to rest will appear. Once the player rests, a level up menu will appear with the ability to select which attributes to raise. Only three attributes per level may be raised. If a skill is designated \"misc\" then its advancement will not count towards level progression.\nDuring character creation, which section a skill is placed in will also partly determine the starting skill level. Major skills start at 30, minor skills start at 15 and \"misc\" skills start at 5, not including racial bonuses and specialization. Major skills increase faster than minor skills, and minor skills increase faster than \"misc.\"\nIncreasing skills.\nSkills can be raised to a maximum level of 100. It is possible to temporarily exceed this cap through the use of enchanted items and potions. The higher the level, the greater the effect the skill has.\nIn Morrowind, skill progression involves the active use of a particular skill. Each time a skill is used successfully, the skill's progression will raise a percentage. Once that reaches 100%, the skill will increase 1 point. The percentage increased is dependent on two factors; the skills specialization, and if it is a major or minor skill.\nPermanent increase.\nThere are three ways to increase skills permanently*:\nTemporary increase.\nSkills may be temporarily raised above 100 with the use of:\nSkill bonuses.\nEach race may grant bonuses to the starting value of certain skills (5\u20137 total bonuses for the vanilla races). In addition, each class will increase the starting value of certain skills (classes also affect the rate at which skills are increased). Racial/Class bonuses will not increase a skill above 100; They only serve as starting values."}

There are 18 skills in total and the development of each is tracked separately. Skill points are a measure of how proficient the &lt;a href=\"Last%20Dragonborn\"&gt;Dragonborn&lt;/a&gt; (or any other character in the world) is at these skills. Increasing them not only improves the actions performed (e.g., more points in the One-Handed skill increase the damage done in attack actions using such weapons, and a higher Lockpicking skill makes the lockpicking minigame easier) but also grants access to &lt;a href=\"Perks%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;perks&lt;/a&gt; that may be learned upon leveling up. Also, when a certain level is reached in some skills, &lt;a href=\"Hold%20Guard\"&gt;guards&lt;/a&gt; and other NPCs will comment on it.\nBy class archetype.\nAll 18 skills can be grouped into 3 distinct categories based on the three &lt;a href=\"Guardian%20Stones\"&gt;guardian signs&lt;/a&gt; (shown in order, 3 of them are located ambiguously between the signs):\nRaising skill level.\nThe level of a given skill is increased as the skill is used successfully - Archery is increased when an &lt;a href=\"Arrows%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;arrow&lt;/a&gt; hits its target; Destruction is increased when a &lt;a href=\"Spell%20Tomes%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;spell&lt;/a&gt; causes damage to the target; Sneak increases when the Dragonborn remains undetected in Sneak mode while in range of NPCs who otherwise could detect them, etc. Conjuration increases a little bit each time the Dragonborn summons a &lt;a href=\"Bound%20Weapons%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Bound Weapon&lt;/a&gt; or creature, for example an &lt;a href=\"Atronach\"&gt;Atronach&lt;/a&gt;. However, most skills must be used in combat in order to gain the increase.\nSome skills, specifically Lockpicking, can increase when an attempt to pick a lock is unsuccessful (when a &lt;a href=\"Lockpick%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;lockpick&lt;/a&gt; breaks). Crafting skills (Alchemy, Enchanting and Smithing), of course, increase mostly by crafting items.\nWhen taken from an in-character context, the idea is that \"practice makes the master.\" Each release of a bow, swing of a sword, spell cast successfully, lock picked, etc. makes the character more \"skilled\" (experienced). While the impact of learning is always more visible at the beginning (i.e., less experience is needed for a skill increase when your skill level is still low), difficult actions require experts or even masters to perform them.\nAnother way to raise a skill is picking up and reading &lt;a href=\"Skill%20Books%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;skill books&lt;/a&gt; located in the game. This can be done once per book.\nSkill experience points and character level up.\nIncreasing skills is key to the character development. When the Dragonborn reaches a pre-specified value of skill increases, they level up. However, most of the opponents in the game are tied to the Dragonborn's experience level (in other words, they also level up when you do), therefore it is advisable to employ a bit of strategy (forward-thinking) when selecting which skills to improve.\nThe effort required to level up a given skill increases with the current level of that skill. Generally, using a more advanced feature of a skill, such as an adept spell, advances the skill more than a novice feature or spell.\nContrary to , it is not possible to have very skilled low level characters. Every skill increase counts for the level-ups, and the increases of skills of already high level count even more.\nTemporary skill increases.\nThe use of &lt;a href=\"Potions%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;potions&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"enchanted%20item\"&gt;enchanted item&lt;/a&gt;s and some &lt;a href=\"active%20effect\"&gt;active effect&lt;/a&gt;s can temporarily increase the level of a skill, in the sense that the enhanced skill level is used when calculating the impact. Even though the enhancements are visible in the impact (e.g., a potion is better if created while the Alchemy skill is fortified), they are disregarded when the skill requirement for learning a new perk is checked (i.e., a base skill score of 30 is needed to learn &lt;a href=\"Dwarven%20Smithing\"&gt;Dwarven Smithing&lt;/a&gt;.\nSee &lt;a href=\"Enchanting%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Enchanting&lt;/a&gt; for further information on skill and ability bonuses provided by enchanted gear.\nLearning perks.\nPerks are cornerstones of character development, enabling some new actions (e.g., crafting a type of armors and weapons such as Dwarven), providing significant boosts to some actions (e.g., +20% damage with a type of weapons) or negating restrictions or penalties (e.g., equipped armor is considered weightless). Of course, there are more perks to choose from than points available (at least until very high levels), so which perks to pick is also a question of strategy.\nLeveling skills without perks.\nPerks are very useful but not necessary. One example is the Lockpicking skill tree, where all perks can be avoided - the lockpicking minigame is harder without them but it is still possible to open any lock that does not require a key. In general, tactical creativity, potions, smithing and enchantments can also greatly improve effectiveness, so it is not impossible to play with very few perks - or none at all.\nSkill Trainers.\nAs in previous \"Elder Scrolls\" titles, the Dragonborn can pay certain characters for training. Each training session provides a single level up for a particular skill and the Dragonborn can train at most five times per character level. Unlike , master trainers in Skyrim cannot advance a Dragonborn's skills beyond level 90. The cost of training grows as the Dragonborn's current skill level increases.\nLegendary Skills.\nLegendary skills is a mechanic introduced in with &lt;a href=\"Patches%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;patch 1.9&lt;/a&gt;. Prior to this patch, the maximum level of a character was 81 without console commands (cheats). The patch allows the player to reset one or more skills, thereby the character can gain additional skill increases leading to level ups and more points that can be spent on perks.\nOnce a skill has reached 100, it can be made \"Legendary.\" This resets the skill back to level 15, and refunds any Perk points that were spent in that skill tree. The dragon symbol, commonly associated with the &lt;a href=\"Imperial%20Legion%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Imperial Legion&lt;/a&gt;, will be displayed under the skill's name, indicating that it has been made Legendary, and a number appears beside it to track how many times this has occurred.\nLegendary skills level up normally, and have no added benefits compared with non-Legendary skills. When a Legendary skill is mastered, it can be made Legendary again. This effectively removes any level cap, since the player can continue to maximize then reset skills an infinite number of times. It also allows them to level using only a small number of skills, so they can level while ignoring unwanted skills or focus on easily leveled skills for faster level gain.\nCons.\nIt is generally inadvisable to make core &lt;a href=\"Combat%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;combat&lt;/a&gt; skills Legendary. For instance, a character whose primary means of attack is with &lt;a href=\"Bows%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;bows&lt;/a&gt; will find themselves severely handicapped by making Archery legendary, although this can be mitigated by having the very best available weapons and armor (which of course were not available when the skill was originally low level), possibly including tempering and enchantments. One should also take into account the ease of leveling various skills.\nNote that when levelling weapon skills (one handed, two handed and archery), the gain is based off the weapon's base damage only, not including tempering or enchantments. A heavily tempered weapon may kill enemies faster even if your skill is low level, but at the cost of actually raising the skill slower, or requiring you to find more enemies to actually fight: so if you decide to legendary a weapon skill, you may want to keep around (for example) something like an untempered, unenchanted Dragonbone version of that weapon, for use against weaker monsters. Armor (both light and heavy, and shields for blocking) is a different matter: the skill gain is based on the amount of base damage taken, before the armor reduces it, so highly tempered and enchanted gear is most beneficial. Also, you will have the benefit of being higher level, and having more health, and better-quality items, than you did when the armor skill was originally low, so fighting an enemy such as a &lt;a href=\"Giant%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;giant&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"Mammoth%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;mammoth&lt;/a&gt; is not necessarily guaranteed to result in death with low-level legendary armor skills, but can be a practical way to re-level them.\nAs for crafting skills (smithing, alchemy and enchanting), the rate of leveling is based on the base gold value of the item being made. Thus, if you legendary these skills, using equipment and potions to fortify these skills speeds up the process of regaining them. Note that you still have to go far enough to re-unlock the perks; you do not get to keep them, and cannot, for instance, re-level smithing quickly by making ebony or dragonbone items at a low smithing level. Keep a lot of gold, silver and gems around instead, since these are universal. Speech also depends on the value of items bought and sold, and merchants have a cap on their wealth. They do not, however, lose investment they have previously received, nor their Master Trader bonus, if you make speech legendary; thus, you do not have to re-unlock the Investor and Master Trader perks, although you will need Investor (Speech 70) anyway to re-unlock Fence (Speech 90).\nPickpocketing and Lockpicking both have a practical limit. Any given lock only provides experience once when picked, not a second time after it resets. There are a finite number of locks, after which the only ways to raise lockpicking is to break lockpicks or use a trainer. Note that master trainers max at level 90. Meanwhile, inventories in picked pockets also do not reset, although Thieves Guild \"&lt;a href=\"The%20Fishing%20Job\"&gt;The Fishing Job&lt;/a&gt;\" radiant quests will slowly supply extra gems to be pickpocketed, and there is the option of pickpocketing trainers for gold after training. Sneak is unchanged when re-levelling after legendary, compared to leveling it the first time.\nHigh-level spells can be cast at low levels, if you have the magicka, including the use of items which reduce the magicka cost of certain schools. This often provides a good way of quick-leveling a legendary magical skill once it has hit level 100 for the first time, especially if you make a full set of enchanted gear for training that skill.\nMaximum level.\nIn order to gain all 251 perks available, a skill must be made Legendary a total of 146 times, or between 8\u20139 times for each skill, if starting at level 81. While there is no maximum level cap, reaching level 252 is sufficient to gain all perks. The math used to reach this answer can be seen below:\nNote: DLC not accounted for\nHold Guard quotes.\nIf these following skills are at a certain level, Hold Guards will respond accordingly:"}

These pox care little for economic or social standing. Poor or rich, young or old, skin pestilences can affect anyone and seem to have a preference for the &lt;a href=\"Dunmer%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Dunmer&lt;/a&gt; complexion. They range from mild annoyances to destructive infestations that leave disfigurement and even death in their wake. The Council of Dunmer Healers, where healing masters from each House gather to exchange information and work together to deal with plagues and diseases at the behest of the &lt;a href=\"Tribunal%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Tribunal&lt;/a&gt;, have dubbed all skin-related illnesses as \"&lt;a href=\"corprus\"&gt;corprus&lt;/a&gt;,\" using the ancient &lt;a href=\"Velothi\"&gt;Velothi&lt;/a&gt; word for \"skin blight.\"\nLike other plagues that ravage the land, corprus maladies have both natural and unnatural origins. Sometimes an &lt;a href=\"Alchemy%20%28Online%29\"&gt;alchemical&lt;/a&gt; or even &lt;a href=\"magic\"&gt;magic&lt;/a&gt;al version of a blight gets loose to devastate the public. Take, for example, the Flay Blight of &lt;a href=\"2E%20565\"&gt;2E 565&lt;/a&gt;. Throughout that long and scorching summer, a terrible affliction ravaged the western shore of &lt;a href=\"Vvardenfell%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Vvardenfell&lt;/a&gt;. Hundreds upon hundreds of Dark Elves contracted rashes that irritated the flesh and blotched the skin. After an extensive investigation by the Council of Healers, it was categorically concluded that the Flay Blight was the direct result of a change to the alchemical formula of Mystic's Majestic Face Cream.\nAs to why the Dunmer integument seems to be notoriously susceptible to corprus maladies, well, the best I can offer is theory and conjecture. Some believe that the Dunmer people are \"ill-favored by fate,\" which makes us particularly predisposed to skin blights and other irritations. Others claim that our ruthless and distrustful nature makes our blood run hot, allowing all manner of disease to breed and take root in our bodies. As a healer, I have found no clear proof of such thermal differences between a Dark Elf or, say, an &lt;a href=\"Orsimer%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Orc&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"Nords%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Nord&lt;/a&gt;. (Although we do appear to run warmer than &lt;a href=\"Argonians%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Argonians&lt;/a&gt;, but that's a subject for another report.) There are also those who hold to the \"old religions\" and see corprus and other blights as direct evidence of &lt;a href=\"Malacath%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Malacath's&lt;/a&gt; fury against the Dunmer. The God of Curses, they believe, tests us by sending affliction after affliction that pushes our physical prowess and overall health to its limits.\nAs a healer and alchemist, I try to leave myth and religion outside when I enter the realm of methodical theorizing. My studies, which include treating afflicted Dunmer and reviewing the work of reputable healers throughout &lt;a href=\"Morrowind%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Morrowind&lt;/a&gt; and the neighboring lands, lead me to conclude that most natural corprus outbreaks\u2014including inflammation and discoloration, as well as flaking and sloughing of corrupted flesh, or an outbreak of blisters or ulcerations\u2014appear to be the result of unsanitary conditions, unbalanced humors, or creatures of foul and ill-tempered disposition. Of course, many of my colleagues scoff at such theories, preferring to believe that every action results from either the interplay of &lt;a href=\"Magicka%20%28Online%29\"&gt;magicka&lt;/a&gt; or the movement of celestial bodies or other more traditional views of healing and sickness.\nIn conclusion, the best method for avoiding corprus blights of all varieties is to bathe often, wear clean garments, and eat and drink only the purest of foods and liquors. If it makes you feel any better, you can also mutter a protective prayer to ward off Malacath's unwanted attentions. The Tribunal knows such arcane rituals probably won't make your chances of contracting a blight any worse, and they'll probably make you feel more comfortable."}

On the other side of the gate, another path leads to &lt;a href=\"Castle%20Skingrad\"&gt;Castle Skingrad&lt;/a&gt;. Past the gate, Skingrad's physical geography is unique among Cyrodilic cities for the &lt;a href=\"Gold%20Road\"&gt;Gold Road&lt;/a&gt; does not merely go through Skingrad, but it is at the bottom of a canyon between the two districts of the city that divides it into a northern half and a southern half. There are no entrances to the city from the canyon and the two halves are connected by a bridge at the west and east ends. \nNorthern Skingrad is where the merchants and tradesmen are located. The &lt;a href=\"guild\"&gt;guild&lt;/a&gt;s are located on the western side toward the entrance, and the merchants are located more inward. Southern Skingrad is the residential district and the home of the &lt;a href=\"Great%20Chapel%20of%20Julianos\"&gt;Great Chapel of Julianos&lt;/a&gt;.\nHistory.\n&lt;a href=\"First%20Era\"&gt;First Era&lt;/a&gt;.\n&lt;a href=\"Rislav%20Larich\"&gt;Rislav Larich&lt;/a&gt;, otherwise known as Rislav the Righteous, was born in &lt;a href=\"1E%20448\"&gt;1E 448&lt;/a&gt; to &lt;a href=\"King%20Mhorus\"&gt;King Mhorus&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Queen%20Lynada\"&gt;Queen Lynada&lt;/a&gt; of Skingrad. In &lt;a href=\"1E%20472\"&gt;1E 472&lt;/a&gt;, the Kingdoms of Skingrad and &lt;a href=\"Kvatch\"&gt;Kvatch&lt;/a&gt; fought over common territories in Colovia. After hostilities ceased, Rislav was married to &lt;a href=\"Belene\"&gt;Belene&lt;/a&gt;, the daughter of &lt;a href=\"King%20Justinius\"&gt;King Justinius&lt;/a&gt; of Kvatch, possibly as a gesture of peace between the two nations. In &lt;a href=\"1E%20478\"&gt;1E 478&lt;/a&gt;, a plague swept into Cyrodiil, killing off many people throughout the Colovian West. Mhorus and all of Rislav's siblings died out, except for &lt;a href=\"Dorald%20Larich\"&gt;Dorald Larich&lt;/a&gt;, who was in the &lt;a href=\"Imperial%20City\"&gt;Imperial City&lt;/a&gt; as a &lt;a href=\"Marukh\"&gt;Marukh&lt;/a&gt;. Dorald traveled to Skingrad to reclaim the throne and bring the worship of the &lt;a href=\"Alessian%20Order\"&gt;Alessian Order&lt;/a&gt; into the city. Dorald's first act was to have Skingrad annexed by the &lt;a href=\"Alessian%20Empire\"&gt;Alessian Empire&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe reaction to this decree was shock and outrage, especially in the Kvatch court where Rislav was. Rislav went to Skingrad with his wife and several calvaries from his father-in-law to fight his brother. Rislav eventually won Skingrad back and seceded from the Alessian Empire. &lt;a href=\"Gorieus\"&gt;Gorieus&lt;/a&gt; caught wind of this and led the Alessian Army to Skingrad to fight Rislav's army. As Rislav had no military experience and Colovian West had just suffered a plague, the battle was expected to be an easy victory for Gorieus. Rislav, however, was able to outsmart Gorieus' army, and the kingdoms of Colovian West banded together to fight the dwindling Alessian Empire. This was the start of the fall of the Alessian Empire. Rislav is remembered as a valiant hero in Skingrad.\n&lt;a href=\"Second%20Era\"&gt;Second Era&lt;/a&gt;.\nBefore the fall of the &lt;a href=\"Reman%20Empire\"&gt;Reman Empire&lt;/a&gt;, each &lt;a href=\"Emperor\"&gt;Emperor&lt;/a&gt; had an &lt;a href=\"Akaviri\"&gt;Akaviri&lt;/a&gt; advisor known as a &lt;a href=\"Potentate\"&gt;Potentate&lt;/a&gt;. Emperor &lt;a href=\"Brazollus%20Dor\"&gt;Brazollus Dor&lt;/a&gt;, who lived on his estate in Skingrad, was seen by some as an uninvolved and unqualified leader. Dor's Potentate, &lt;a href=\"Sidri-Ashak\"&gt;Sidri-Ashak&lt;/a&gt;, was more involved in politics, but his political history was overshadowed by &lt;a href=\"Versidue%20Shaie\"&gt;Versidue Shaie&lt;/a&gt;.\nDuring the &lt;a href=\"Colovian%20Revolt\"&gt;Colovian Revolt&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"2E%20576\"&gt;2E 576&lt;/a&gt;, Count &lt;a href=\"Varen%20Aquilarios\"&gt;Varen Aquilarios&lt;/a&gt; of Chorrol drew support from Colovian regions, including Skingrad. In &lt;a href=\"2E%20582\"&gt;2E 582&lt;/a&gt;, Count &lt;a href=\"Calantius\"&gt;Calantius&lt;/a&gt; of Skingrad and the &lt;a href=\"Elder%20Council\"&gt;Elder Council&lt;/a&gt; started an initiative to take control of the &lt;a href=\"Northern%20Woods\"&gt;Arenthia Vale&lt;/a&gt; and make it the &lt;a href=\"South%20Weald\"&gt;South Weald&lt;/a&gt;, while still managing to keep the city out of the &lt;a href=\"Alliance%20War\"&gt;Alliance War&lt;/a&gt;.\n&lt;a href=\"Third%20Era\"&gt;Third Era&lt;/a&gt;.\nIn &lt;a href=\"3E%20433\"&gt;3E 433&lt;/a&gt;, Skingrad prospered, along with the other eight cities in Cyrodiil. The city was under the leadership of a &lt;a href=\"Vampire%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;vampire&lt;/a&gt; named &lt;a href=\"Count%20Janus%20Hassildor\"&gt;Count Janus Hassildor&lt;/a&gt;, a private yet powerful man in both politics and magic.\nIn the very late third era, &lt;a href=\"Mehrunes%20Dagon\"&gt;Mehrunes Dagon&lt;/a&gt; launched the &lt;a href=\"Oblivion%20Crisis\"&gt;Oblivion Crisis&lt;/a&gt;. An &lt;a href=\"Oblivion%20Gate\"&gt;Oblivion Gate&lt;/a&gt; opened up outside of Skingrad, which when closed by the &lt;a href=\"Hero%20of%20Kvatch\"&gt;Hero of Kvatch&lt;/a&gt;, allowed them to recruit troops from Skingrad to aid in repulsing the attack on Bruma later on.\n&lt;a href=\"Fourth%20Era\"&gt;Fourth Era&lt;/a&gt;.\nIn &lt;a href=\"4E%20174\"&gt;4E 174&lt;/a&gt;, the city of Skingrad, along with the town of &lt;a href=\"Bravil\"&gt;Bravil&lt;/a&gt;, was captured by the &lt;a href=\"Third%20Aldmeri%20Dominion\"&gt;Third Aldmeri Dominion&lt;/a&gt; during the &lt;a href=\"Great%20War\"&gt;Great War&lt;/a&gt;. At the &lt;a href=\"Battle%20of%20the%20Red%20Ring\"&gt;Battle of the Red Ring&lt;/a&gt;, the Imperial Legion was surrounded on all fronts and showed bitter resistance toward the invading Altmer. &lt;a href=\"General%20Jonna\"&gt;General Jonna&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"General%20Decianus\"&gt;General Decianus&lt;/a&gt; fought &lt;a href=\"Lord%20Naarifin\"&gt;Lord Naarifin&lt;/a&gt;'s army and the Dominion counterattack coming from Bravil. The battle was won by the &lt;a href=\"Mede%20Empire\"&gt;Mede Empire&lt;/a&gt;, but many felt that the Dominion were the true victors after the signing of the &lt;a href=\"White-Gold%20Concordat\"&gt;White-Gold Concordat&lt;/a&gt;."}

The city is divided into two sections: North and South. It is separated by a huge trench running through the city. The city is noted for its wealth and prosperity, making it one of the nicest in &lt;a href=\"Cyrodiil\"&gt;Cyrodiil&lt;/a&gt;. The surrounding land is lush and flat, with lots of vegetation, which make it ideal for farms and vineyards.\nBackground.\nBefore &lt;a href=\"Kvatch%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;Kvatch&lt;/a&gt; was destroyed, Skingrad was likely the third largest city in Cyrodiil. Afterward, it seems to be the second. In addition to its size, most of the people of Skingrad appear to be very wealthy, many with large houses. However, on the chapel side, a number of people live in run down homes. The &lt;a href=\"Castle%20Skingrad\"&gt;city castle&lt;/a&gt; rests on a hill above the rest of the city. Skingrad and &lt;a href=\"Anvil%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;Anvil&lt;/a&gt; are the only two cities in &lt;a href=\"Cyrodiil\"&gt;Cyrodiil&lt;/a&gt; with the castle outside of the cities walls.\nMost of the city can be viewed from the bridge. Skingrad has a number of &lt;a href=\"Vampire%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;vampires&lt;/a&gt; in the vicinity. This would likely explain the &lt;a href=\"Garlic%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;garlic clusters&lt;/a&gt; (which are present in nearly every building). Unknown to the citizens, the &lt;a href=\"Janus%20Hassildor\"&gt;Count&lt;/a&gt; is a vampire himself.\nQuests.\nQuests which start in Skingrad:\nDescription.\nSkingrad County is famous for its wines, tomatoes, and cheeses. Skingrad is one of the cleanest, safest, and most prosperous towns in &lt;a href=\"Cyrodiil\"&gt;Cyrodiil&lt;/a&gt;. Located in the heart of the &lt;a href=\"West%20Weald%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;West Weald&lt;/a&gt; highlands, Skingrad is the gem of Old &lt;a href=\"Colovia\"&gt;Colovia&lt;/a&gt;, and a model of the Colovian virtues of independence, hard work, and tough-mindedness. Skingrad is a model of a well run, orderly county. Crime, gambling, and public drunkenness are almost unknown, and its wines and cheeses command high prices all over &lt;a href=\"Tamriel\"&gt;Tamriel&lt;/a&gt;. The city reportedly has a vampire problem and has garlic clusters to ward off the vampires.\nCount and Countess.\n&lt;a href=\"Janus%20Hassildor\"&gt;Janus Hassildor&lt;/a&gt;, the Count of Skingrad, resides in the Castle of Skingrad, but unlike the other Counts and Countesses, he is a vampire, which would explain why citizens \"do not see him during the day or in the morning.\" He and his wife were accidentally infected with the disease. The &lt;a href=\"Hero%20of%20Kvatch\"&gt;Hero&lt;/a&gt;, then a &lt;a href=\"Vampire%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;vampire&lt;/a&gt;, found a cure for &lt;a href=\"Vampirism%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;vampirism&lt;/a&gt; and as a reward for discovering it the Count gave them a bottle of the cure.\nJanus Hassildor, Count Skingrad, has ruled Skingrad for many years, and is known by reputation to be a powerful wizard. He is a very private man, and neglects his chapel devotions to the &lt;a href=\"Nine%20Divines\"&gt;Nine Divines&lt;/a&gt;. He is widely honored and respected by his people, and under his rule, Skingrad is a considered of a well run, orderly county.\nSkingrad is the only city in Cyrodiil without a\u00a0&lt;a href=\"Court%20Wizard\"&gt;Court Wizard&lt;/a&gt;.\nLayout.\nSkingrad has three districts: the Castle, Hightown, and Chapel. A low road runs east-west under the wall and bridges of the upper town. The Guilds and &lt;a href=\"West%20Weald%20Inn\"&gt;West Weald Inn&lt;/a&gt; are in the west of Hightown, while many shops and upper class residences are arranged along a street in the north. The southern half of the town includes the chapel at its east end, with Skingrad's other lodgings, &lt;a href=\"Two%20Sisters%20Lodge\"&gt;The Two Sisters Lordge&lt;/a&gt;, on a street in the center, with other residences, modest and mean, scattered through the rest of the district. Gates and bridges cross the low road to connect Hightown and Chapel in several places. &lt;a href=\"Castle%20Skingrad\"&gt;Castle Skingrad&lt;/a&gt; is completely separate from the town, standing on a high prominence to the southeast. A road from the town's east gate leads from town to castle.\nLodging and dining.\nThere are two inns in Skingrad. One, The Two Sisters Lodge, is owned by two &lt;a href=\"Orsimer%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;Orcs&lt;/a&gt;. The inn is clean and well-ordered, and is troubled by neither riot or public drunkenness. The other inn is run by a pleasant &lt;a href=\"Imperials%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;Imperial&lt;/a&gt; woman. Neither of these proprietors are to be seen in the Great Chapel of Julianos. To purchase a batch of Skingrad's famous sweet rolls go to the Chapel District to &lt;a href=\"Salmo%20the%20Baker%27s%20House\"&gt;Salmo the Baker's House&lt;/a&gt;.

Since then, the drug has been used across the continent.\nUses.\nWhen used, skooma increases the user's strength, speed, and restores stamina. Some of the more addictive effects of the drug are bouts of euphoria, protracted lethargy, loss of voice, minor fits, and possibly death.\nAddiction.\nOnce someone has become addicted to skooma, it is said there is no &lt;a href=\"potion\"&gt;potion&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"blessing\"&gt;blessing&lt;/a&gt;, or &lt;a href=\"spells\"&gt;magical incantation&lt;/a&gt; that can cure them. In fact, there is a common truism amongst the &lt;a href=\"Khajiit\"&gt;Khajiit&lt;/a&gt; that no such cure exists; that one who has become dependent upon it is forever made a hopeless &lt;a href=\"slave\"&gt;slave&lt;/a&gt; to its allure. This, however, is false, and one may free themselves and regain control through knowledge, understanding, and self-acceptance. Only once the addict overcomes the burden of their own self-despising is there the possibility of redemption. Despite this, an &lt;a href=\"Argonian\"&gt;Argonian&lt;/a&gt; addict of the drug named &lt;a href=\"Wujeeta\"&gt;Wujeeta&lt;/a&gt; was able to cure her addiction by drinking a healing potion.\nSkooma trade.\nSince skooma is a narcotic, the &lt;a href=\"Mede%20Empire\"&gt;Empire&lt;/a&gt; has banned it in many provinces. Despite this, many criminals and dealers will sell this to anyone that is interested in buying their product. The primary source of income in &lt;a href=\"Elsweyr\"&gt;Elsweyr&lt;/a&gt; is the exportation of moon sugar, which is used to make Skooma. In fact, half of the southern population of Elsweyr are known as \"sugar tooths,\" a slang word for a skooma addict. Some criminals have formed large operations out of making and selling skooma, as some criminals sell them in large cities such as &lt;a href=\"Riften%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Riften&lt;/a&gt; and other places. There are also secret dens where people can buy or use the drug such as the &lt;a href=\"Bravil%20Skooma%20Den\"&gt;Bravil Skooma Den&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Cyrodiil\"&gt;Cyrodiil&lt;/a&gt;, or the &lt;a href=\"Redwater%20Den\"&gt;Redwater Den&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Skyrim\"&gt;Skyrim&lt;/a&gt;. Some people in places such as &lt;a href=\"Morrowind\"&gt;Morrowind&lt;/a&gt; will refuse to do business with people carrying the drug, however some people in &lt;a href=\"Cyrodiil\"&gt;Cyrodiil&lt;/a&gt; are willing to sell or purchase it. Skooma in &lt;a href=\"Skyrim\"&gt;Skyrim&lt;/a&gt; is \"watered down\" and not as strong as in other provinces. The Khajiit have a tolerance to skooma and moon sugar, as they consume it in some form every day.\nUsage.\nSkooma can be used by vaporizing the liquid and smoked through a pipe or by drinking it in its liquid form."}

Around this time he was leading a campaign in the region near &lt;a href=\"Lake%20Honrich\"&gt;Lake Honrich&lt;/a&gt;, to drive the &lt;a href=\"Snow%20Elves\"&gt;Snow Elves&lt;/a&gt; north to the main host of his forces.\nDuring his campaign, he inadvertently discovered a hidden stronghold of &lt;a href=\"Dragon%20Cult\"&gt;Dragon Cult&lt;/a&gt;ists in the secluded monastery of &lt;a href=\"Forelhost\"&gt;Forelhost&lt;/a&gt; high in the &lt;a href=\"Jerall%20Mountains\"&gt;Jerall Mountains&lt;/a&gt;. This surprised Skorm, as it was believed that they were all wiped out during the &lt;a href=\"Dragon%20War\"&gt;Dragon War&lt;/a&gt;. Deciding it was too big a threat to ignore, Skorm and his men attempted a preemptive strike to deal with the cult quickly, but it failed and a siege ensued for several weeks. To make matters worse, a blizzard struck, massively slowing down their advance.\nWith the help of a &lt;a href=\"Tongues\"&gt;voice master&lt;/a&gt;, the main gate was breached, though the voice master was killed in the process. The cultists retreated into the interior of the monastery and collapsed the main stairway to block access to the refectory. Eventually, Skorm and his men took the fortress, but discovered the cultists had committed mass suicide, either by poison or slitting their wrists.\nWithin the catacombs they discovered a well, with several buckets already filled. Several thirsty soldiers drank the water, not knowing that it had been poisoned by the cultists, and died. Demoralized and now at half their original strength, Skorm abandoned the search for any cultist survivors and left the monastery to push his forces north the next day. He did, however, leave his \"&lt;a href=\"Skorm%20Snow-Strider%27s%20Journal\"&gt;journal&lt;/a&gt;\" behind in the hopes that eventually, &lt;a href=\"Last%20Dragonborn\"&gt;someone&lt;/a&gt; would make sure that the cultists were eliminated for good."}

The first few days met with heavy resistance, but as we approached the eastern edge of we have seen little and less of them.\n21st of &lt;a href=\"Sun%27s%20Dusk\"&gt;Sun's Dusk&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"1E%20139\"&gt;1E139&lt;/a&gt;\nWe've begun to receive reports of attacks back around Lake Honnith and word has come from the front that we should pull back to be sure we are not leaving our rear exposed. If there is a stronghold of Elves here, we will surely root them out.\n27th of Sun's Dusk 1E139\nIt sounds impossible, but we appeared to have stumbled upon a massive hold out of the &lt;a href=\"Dragon%20Cult\"&gt;Dragon Cult&lt;/a&gt;ists, who were believed to be wiped out during the &lt;a href=\"Dragon%20War\"&gt;Dragon War&lt;/a&gt;. The Elves must wait, as this is a threat we cannot ignore. If we are quick, we may be able to catch them unaware and avoid a lengthy siege.\n21st of Evening Star 1E139\nThird week of the siege. The men grow restless with the cold and all miss their families. If that blasted storm hadn't caught us off guard and slowed our ascent we might have taken the Monastery, but as it stands we may be in for several more weeks of pounding on their walls. I've sent word to Harald to send one of the &lt;a href=\"Tongues\"&gt;Voice masters&lt;/a&gt; to help bring down the wall.\n4th of Morning Star &lt;a href=\"1E%20140\"&gt;1E140&lt;/a&gt;\nWe've brought down their main gate thanks to the young Voice master, but the brash lad took an arrow in the neck in the process. It seems he will be joining the &lt;a href=\"Eight%20Divines\"&gt;Eight&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Sovngarde%20%28Location%29\"&gt;Sovngarde&lt;/a&gt; soon. The cultists have fallen back to the interior of the Monastery but soon enough we will breach those defenses. The sooner the better - it's too blasted cold on this mountain.\n5th of Morning Star 1E140\nWe entered the Monastery today only to find all inside dead. It appears they purposely caved in the stairway to the refectory and then took their own lives. Some appear to have slit their own wrists, others we found with empty vials. Most appear to be poisoned, but oddly there are not as many empty bottles as one would expect by the number of dead. We shall hold up here over night rather than face the cold and explore the catacombs in the morning to see if we can find another passage to the upper areas.\n6th of Morning Star 1E140\nMay the Eight protect us from &lt;a href=\"Dragons%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Dragons&lt;/a&gt; and madmen. We lost half our remaining men today. We discovered a well in the catacombs, locked but with several buckets already filled, and in their excitement for a drink that didn't risk frostbite on their tongue, two score drank before we could stop them. Gods only know how these cultists could use that horrible poison in their own water supply. We've lost more men to this catastrophe than we did taking the courtyard.\nThe Well was locked from this side, and the key must be somewhere in the catacombs, but with the ghosts of the dead cultists and the men demoralized, it just isn't worth the search. Let those gods-forsaken cultists drink their way to &lt;a href=\"Oblivion%20%28Realm%29\"&gt;Oblivion&lt;/a&gt; and be done with it. The upper door in the courtyard has some sort of barrier over it and our mages believe that the sacrifice made here will sustain it for decades at the least.\nWe leave this accursed place tomorrow to regroup and push up north, but I will leave this journal, so that in an age or so when the poison has faded, someone may find a way in to be sure the cultists met their due fate."}

She and her husband, &lt;a href=\"Camaron%20of%20Sentinel\"&gt;Camaron of Sentinel&lt;/a&gt;, ruled a large swathe of land in northern Hammerfell. However, her husband was killed at the &lt;a href=\"Battle%20of%20Cryngaine%20Field\"&gt;Battle of Cryngaine Field&lt;/a&gt; during the &lt;a href=\"War%20for%20Betony\"&gt;War for Betony&lt;/a&gt;, and she was forced to step down from her position as Queen of Sentinel. She produced two male heirs for Camaron, &lt;a href=\"Greklith\"&gt;Greklith&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Lhotun\"&gt;Lhotun&lt;/a&gt;, and gave birth to their eldest child and daughter &lt;a href=\"Aubk%27i\"&gt;Aubk'i&lt;/a&gt;.\nSometime after the agent of &lt;a href=\"Uriel%20Septim%20VII\"&gt;Uriel Septim VII&lt;/a&gt; helped Prince Lhotun gain information about the eldest son of the royal family of Sentinel, he received a summons from Queen Akorithi. The Queen asked the agent to retrieve a painting from somewhere in &lt;a href=\"Wayrest%20%28Daggerfall%29\"&gt;Wayrest&lt;/a&gt; Castle. She claimed the painting was an heirloom of the now-deceased King &lt;a href=\"Lysandus%20of%20Daggerfall\"&gt;Lysandus of Daggerfall&lt;/a&gt;. The painting was somehow magical, the scene in the painting shifted and twisted. The agent clearly could see the inside of a tent. Several men in the livery of Wayrest were intensely arguing with a man bearing the coat of arms of Daggerfall. One of the Wayrest men slipped behind the Daggerfall man, drew a dagger, and casually slid it between his ribs. The image then disappeared as soon as the life ebbed from his body, and then started over again.\nQueen Akorithi was one of the wielders of the &lt;a href=\"Numidium\"&gt;Numidium&lt;/a&gt;. She was one of the seven retrievers of the &lt;a href=\"Totem%20of%20Tiber%20Septim\"&gt;Totem of Tiber Septim&lt;/a&gt;, a tool for controlling the &lt;a href=\"Dwemer\"&gt;Dwemer&lt;/a&gt; construct. Originally, there was only one Totem of Tiber Septim, but a strange time-warping effect known as the &lt;a href=\"Warp%20in%20the%20West\"&gt;Warp in the West&lt;/a&gt; made all seven parties of the &lt;a href=\"Iliac%20Bay\"&gt;Iliac Bay&lt;/a&gt; receive the Totem.\nSeveral years after the Warp of the West, a plague struck Sentinel. The plague took the Queen's life as well as Crown Prince Greklith's life, leaving the throne to Prince Lhotun.\nInteractions.\n&lt;a href=\"The%20Missing%20Prince\"&gt;The Missing Prince&lt;/a&gt;.\n&lt;a href=\"The%20Agent\"&gt;The Agent&lt;/a&gt; can deliver the \"&lt;a href=\"Death%20Certificate\"&gt;Death Certificate&lt;/a&gt;\" to Akorithi, instead of Prince Lhotun.

Here is an enchanted for your service to Sentinel.\"\nIf K'avar escaped:\n\"By the Sands of Elsweyr! Lord K'avar is a slippery one, indeed. Well, I will track him down eventually, never fear.

His associates have all been arrested or fled the realm, so Lord K'avar no longer poses any threat, at least. , please accept this enchanted for your service to Sentinel.\"\n\"Ah, . I was hoping you would come. My spies have located the elusive Lord K'avar. He has turned up at the court of Wayrest, of all places, apparently trying to obtain support for his pathetic claim to my throne. Wayrest would not be so rash as to openly give refuge to a convicted traitor to Sentinel, but he is hiding somewhere in Castle Wayrest, and I want you to find him and bring him back. Alive if possible, but kill him if necessary. Do not let him escape again.\"\nIf K'avar is captured:\n\"Well, well, if it isn't my loyal Lord K'avar, come back to me. Did you really believe you could escape my wrath? Guards, take him downstairs and execute him immediately., I knew I could count on you. The friendship of the Queen of Sentinel is reward enough, but I have prepared some more tangible gifts as well.\"\nIf K'avar is killed:\n\"Lord K'avar deserved death.

The &lt;a href=\"Muiri%27s%20Ring\"&gt;bonus&lt;/a&gt; for killing Nilsine cannot be obtained.\nStrategy.\nFound deep within Raldbthar, Alain is flanked by numerous &lt;a href=\"Bandits%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;bandits&lt;/a&gt;. He wields &lt;a href=\"Aegisbane\"&gt;Aegisbane&lt;/a&gt;, a unique enchanted &lt;a href=\"Warhammers%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;warhammer&lt;/a&gt;. Having resist-frost potions may help. If the Dragonborn succeeds at &lt;a href=\"Lockpicking%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;picking&lt;/a&gt; a Master&lt;a href=\"Lock%20Level\"&gt;-level lock&lt;/a&gt;, they can gain access to an elevated level behind Dufont, where lever-activated ballistae sit. He can be killed in one hit and covertly using this method. Also, there is a puddle of oil lying around Alain and his friends. Ignite it with a fire spell or shout, and a few of his guards will most likely be killed."}

Azah will ask for your help in stopping him. \nYour first order of business is to destroy the focus points Alasan's minions have set up around &lt;a href=\"Tava%27s%20Blessing%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Tava's Blessing&lt;/a&gt;. The East Focus will be just out the door, to the left. From there, head to the west and you will find the West Focus by the fountain. Further west, you will find a man named &lt;a href=\"Jeromec%20Lemal\"&gt;Jeromec Lemal&lt;/a&gt; who will give you the quest &lt;a href=\"Warship%20Designs\"&gt;Warship Designs&lt;/a&gt;; that quest also takes place in Tava's Blessing so it is efficient to do both quests simultaneously. Either way, head to the north of town; you will find the north focus on a ship there. \nOnce all three focuses are destroyed, head for the lighthouse in the north of town. At the top of the lighthouse, you will find Alasan engaged in the ritual to become a Lich. Speak with him and he will say that he is already bound to the Ansei Ward, and that if you strike him down now, you will break the ward. Kill him anyway; the ward will break, but Alasan's ghost will appear and tell you that he is not finished. Pick up the broken Ansei Ward and the spirit of &lt;a href=\"Ansei%20Maja\"&gt;Ansei Maja&lt;/a&gt; will appear. She will tell you that her strength is fading because her ward is broken, but that you can reforge the blade. For this, you will need to capture the desert wind, the milk of a goat and earth from a fallen warrior's grave. \nHead outside and start looking for these things. The dead in Tava's Blessing will have risen though, so watch out for all the &lt;a href=\"Ra-Netu\"&gt;Ra-Netu&lt;/a&gt;. Head south and you will find a goat just across the bridge; milk it for the goat's milk. For the desert wind, head south out of town. You will see several sandstorms; capture one of them, then head to the northeast of town for the final ingredient. You will find multiple graves here; collect some dirt from one of them.\n\"&lt;The coals are burning hot.&gt;\"\nOnce you have all the materials, head to the south end of town and use the blacksmith's forge to reforge the Ansei Ward. Once you are done, take the Ward from the fire and place it on the shrine next to the statues in the center of town. Once you do so, the spirits of Alasan and Ansei Maja will appear; take the ward and use it on Alasan to trap him. Talk to Ansei Maja after this and she will say that Alasan will forever be imprisoned in the ward and will never pose a threat again. When asked about the last Ward, she will tell you that it is in the possession of Alasan and &lt;a href=\"Uwafa\"&gt;Uwafa&lt;/a&gt;'s sibling, but she cannot tell you who this is or where they are. \nHead southeast of town and speak with Prince Azah there. He will promise to keep the ward safe, but will not know the identity of the last sibling. This will end the quest and start the next one, \"&lt;a href=\"Shiri%27s%20Research\"&gt;Shiri's Research&lt;/a&gt;.\""}

The regional deity is &lt;a href=\"Kynareth\"&gt;Kynareth&lt;/a&gt;. Alcaire is well-known for being the supposed birthplace of &lt;a href=\"Tiber%20Septim\"&gt;Tiber Septim&lt;/a&gt;, founder of the &lt;a href=\"Third%20Empire\"&gt;Third Empire&lt;/a&gt;. The fiefdom is riddled with farming communities and fishing villages with constant harvest flowing through the market.\nDescription.\nGeography.\nThe city-state of Alcaire is located north of the coast, towards the &lt;a href=\"Wrothgarian%20Mountains\"&gt;Wrothgarian Mountains&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Rivenspire\"&gt;Rivenspire&lt;/a&gt; region in the north. The Fiefdom of Alcaire has a large blotch of land in the west, but as it goes towards the &lt;a href=\"Kingdom%20of%20Wayrest\"&gt;Kingdom of Wayrest&lt;/a&gt;, the fiefdom becomes thinner, until it reaches the &lt;a href=\"County%20of%20Menevia\"&gt;County of Menevia&lt;/a&gt;. The Alcaire West is bountiful, a large river starting from Alcaire flows through the region, eventually landing onto the Iliac Bay, farms and other settlements tend to inhabit around this riverway. South of this land is several islands, where the &lt;a href=\"Koeglin%20Lighthouse\"&gt;Koeglin Lighthouse&lt;/a&gt; shines brightly, guiding ships to &lt;a href=\"Koeglin%20Village\"&gt;Koeglin Village&lt;/a&gt;. Bordering the fiefdom are several other nations, including &lt;a href=\"Koegria\"&gt;Koegria&lt;/a&gt; and the earlier mentioned Menevia. After the &lt;a href=\"Warp%20in%20the%20West\"&gt;Warp in the West&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"3E%20417\"&gt;3E 417&lt;/a&gt;, the Fiefdom of Alcaire was annexed into the Kingdom of Wayrest, which extends all the way to the &lt;a href=\"Fiefdom%20of%20Anticlere\"&gt;Fiefdom of Anticlere&lt;/a&gt;. The religious temple in the area is the &lt;a href=\"Temple%20of%20Kynareth\"&gt;Temple of Kynareth&lt;/a&gt;, which has chapters in &lt;a href=\"Daggerfall\"&gt;Daggerfall&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Kozanset\"&gt;Kozanset&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Whiterun\"&gt;Whiterun&lt;/a&gt;. The knightly order is the &lt;a href=\"Knights%20of%20the%20Flame\"&gt;Knights of the Flame&lt;/a&gt; and the local vampire clan is the &lt;a href=\"Lyrezi%20Clan\"&gt;Lyrezi Clan&lt;/a&gt;.\nHistory.\n&lt;a href=\"Second%20Era\"&gt;Second Era&lt;/a&gt;.\nSir Byric of the Flame &amp; the Alcaire Knights.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Alcaire%20Knights\"&gt;Alcaire Knights&lt;/a&gt; served the Fiefdom of Alcaire for many generations, ever since the various knightly orders had driven the &lt;a href=\"Direnni%20Hegemony\"&gt;Direnni Hegemony&lt;/a&gt; back to the &lt;a href=\"Isle%20of%20Balfiera\"&gt;Isle of Balfiera&lt;/a&gt;. Ushering in the rule of the Bretons over High Rock and the &lt;a href=\"Western%20Reach\"&gt;Western Reach&lt;/a&gt; that we know. &lt;a href=\"Sir%20Byric%20of%20the%20Flame\"&gt;Sir Byric of the Flame&lt;/a&gt; served the Alcaire Knights and the Fiefdom in their weakest time. In &lt;a href=\"2E%20542\"&gt;2E 542&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"Reachmen\"&gt;Reachmen&lt;/a&gt; had invaded Alcaire with unknown intent, overpowering the Bretons of Alcaire. To repel the invading force, Sir Byric had burnt the vast fields of the region, demolishing the Reachmen Horde and protecting Alcaire Castle. In honor of his bold actions and determination, the Alcaire Knights were renamed into the Knights of the Flame, becoming a well-known group throughout &lt;a href=\"Greater%20Bretony\"&gt;Greater Bretony&lt;/a&gt; and the province of High Rock, eventually spreading to &lt;a href=\"Anticlere\"&gt;Anticlere&lt;/a&gt;.\nRise of the Black Drake; Siege of Wayrest.\nIn &lt;a href=\"2E%20541\"&gt;2E 541&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Durcorach%20the%20Black%20Drake\"&gt;Durcorach the Black Drake&lt;/a&gt; and his &lt;a href=\"Reachmen\"&gt;Reachmen Horde&lt;/a&gt; had invaded the province of High Rock from the &lt;a href=\"Western%20Reach\"&gt;Western Reach&lt;/a&gt;. In its wake, they took control of the nearby city-states of &lt;a href=\"Evermore\"&gt;Evermore&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Hallin%27s%20Stand\"&gt;Hallin's Stand&lt;/a&gt;. As time went on, the Black Drake Invasion had reached the region of &lt;a href=\"Stormhaven%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Stormhaven&lt;/a&gt;, causing the Bretons of the area to go into a state of panic. All over Stormhaven, including Alcaire, people would evacuate to the city-state of &lt;a href=\"Wayrest\"&gt;Wayrest&lt;/a&gt;, hoping for protection from the Reachmen Horde. Eventually, the &lt;a href=\"Siege%20of%20Wayrest%20%282E%20542%29\"&gt;Siege of Wayrest&lt;/a&gt; had begun, ongoing for fifty-seven days. The crowded conditions in Wayrest were but a small price to pay for the protection of Wayrest. Because the Reachmen lacked siege weapons or battleships, the Siege of Wayrest ended in a stalemate, forcing the Horde to advance westward to the region of &lt;a href=\"Glenumbra\"&gt;Glenumbra&lt;/a&gt; and the city-state of &lt;a href=\"Daggerfall\"&gt;Daggerfall&lt;/a&gt;. Wayrest was saved, and the Reachmen Horde was defeated at the city gates of Daggerfall. Out of the battle came the &lt;a href=\"Daggerfall%20Covenant\"&gt;Daggerfall Covenant&lt;/a&gt;, one of the strongest alliances in the continent.\nDaedric Influence in Koeglin; the Supernal Dreamers.\nDuring the &lt;a href=\"Interregnum\"&gt;Interregnum&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"2E%20582\"&gt;2E 582&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Dame%20Dabienne\"&gt;Dame Dabienne&lt;/a&gt; was a member of the Knights of the Flame that was wrongfully accused of a crime in the township of &lt;a href=\"Koeglin%20Village\"&gt;Koeglin Village&lt;/a&gt;. At the time, a Daedric Cult known as the &lt;a href=\"Supernal%20Dreamers\"&gt;Supernal Dreamers&lt;/a&gt; were active in the area, and so there was a daedric presence throughout Stormhaven, even in Alcaire. Lucky for Dabienne, an &lt;a href=\"Vestige\"&gt;estranged warrior&lt;/a&gt; had arrived on the scene and was tasked by the Knight to uncover this mystery. The traveler spoke with &lt;a href=\"Constable%20Pascal\"&gt;Constable Pascal&lt;/a&gt;, who felt that Dame Dabienne was an imposter, sent to enslave the town. &lt;a href=\"Messenger%20Cordier\"&gt;Messenger Cordier&lt;/a&gt; was supposed to give the Constable a message saying that Dame Dabienne was arriving onto Koeglin Village. When the warrior rescued Cordier from a nearby slaver's ship, he told the message to Pascal, but despite this, the Constable would not let Dabienne free.\nConstable Pascal still does not believe in Dame Dabienne, citing too many coincidences. The warrior continues around town, to deal with situations to free the Knight. Eventually, Pascal suspected the warrior as well, who would then continue to investigate Koeglin for Pascal's paranoid behavior, through conversing with his former lover, &lt;a href=\"Sabyssa%20the%20Blacksmith\"&gt;Sabyssa the Blacksmith&lt;/a&gt;, it was revealed that a Supernal Dreamer had left Pascal's home one night. The traveler leaves to enter Pascal's home, discovering a &lt;a href=\"Dremora%20Churl\"&gt;Dremora Churl&lt;/a&gt; and a daedric idol underneath his bed. Constable Pascal was apprehended and Dame Dabienne was freed. She continued to watch over the Koeglin township and told the traveler, an Agent of the &lt;a href=\"Daggerfall%20Covenant\"&gt;Daggerfall Covenant&lt;/a&gt;, to head northwards to Alcaire Castle, where the warriors of the &lt;a href=\"Alik%27r%20Desert\"&gt;Alik'r Desert&lt;/a&gt; have stationed outside the premises.\nTension at Alcaire; Enter Duchess Lakana of the Alik'r.\nDuring the &lt;a href=\"Interregnum\"&gt;Interregnum&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"2E%20582\"&gt;2E 582&lt;/a&gt;, the Duchy of Alcaire was under the leadership of &lt;a href=\"Duke%20Nathaniel\"&gt;Duke Nathaniel&lt;/a&gt;, who had just married &lt;a href=\"Lakana\"&gt;Lakana&lt;/a&gt;, the daughter of &lt;a href=\"King%20Fahara%27jad\"&gt;King Fahara'jad&lt;/a&gt;. To further establish the bond between High Rock and &lt;a href=\"Hammerfell\"&gt;Hammerfell&lt;/a&gt;, Nathaniel had married Lakana. This newly-established relationship prompted King Fahara'jad to send a group of Alik'r Warriors to safeguard the area. However, this brought controversy to the people of Alcaire and even the Knights of the Flame. &lt;a href=\"Dame%20Falhut\"&gt;Dame Falhut&lt;/a&gt; believed that the Alik'r Army was sent to attack the Bretons. The traveler was directed by Falhut to &lt;a href=\"Sir%20Hughes\"&gt;Sir Hughes&lt;/a&gt;, who was safeguarding the Duke and Duchess in Castle Alcaire, who was annoyed by Falhut's accusations and orders to the Alik'r, but another problem had arrived, someone was sending messages to King Fahara'jad from within the Castle, using the codename, Almadine. It was revealed that Duchess Lakana was the one sending the letters to her father. Her reason was that she could not trust anyone in Alcaire, not even the Duke, there have been several assassination attempts on her life, prompting her to get worried.\nTreachery at Alcaire; Plot against the Duchess.\nThe Duchess had tasked the estranged champion with investigating the several assassination attempts, to see if they are connected in some ways. The Duchess believes that rival to the Alik'r is responsible for the attempts, so she sends the warrior to &lt;a href=\"General%20Thoda\"&gt;General Thoda&lt;/a&gt;, whose located on the outskirts of Alcaire Castle. The traveler explained themselves to Thoda until he was poisoned by the assassin, Dame Falhut, she fled back to Castletown in Alcaire where the warrior would kill her. Duchess Lakana mourned the loss of General Thoda, but she believes that Dame Falhut did not work alone. Both the warrior and Sir Hughes worked together to uncover the accomplices. Sir Hughes had sent the traveler to his home, to meet with him after speaking with the Duchess. Upon arriving at his home, the traveler discovered &lt;a href=\"Envoy%20Darima\"&gt;Envoy Darima&lt;/a&gt;, Lakana's messenger tied up, fearing for Lakana's safety. The traveler hurried to Castle Alcaire to find Lakana dead by Sir Hughes' hands. Sir Hughes fled to &lt;a href=\"Firebrand%20Keep\"&gt;Firebrand Keep&lt;/a&gt;, home to the Knights of the Flame.\nBattle of Firebrand Keep; the Omen of Fear.\nAfter escaping Alcaire Castle, Sir Hughes had ordered an attack on the Alik'ran Army, but this had left the Knights of the Flame divided. Warriors including &lt;a href=\"Sir%20Edmund\"&gt;Sir Edmund&lt;/a&gt; were against the attack on the Alik'r, and so he and the warrior traveled throughout Firebrand Keep, convincing Knights to join their cause to prevent an attack on the Redguards. With an abundant amount of supporters, the champion sounded the Great Hall's siege horn, starting the Battle of Firebrand Keep, between two factions of the Knights of the Flame. &lt;a href=\"Sir%20Croix\"&gt;Sir Croix&lt;/a&gt;, a member of the Knights of the Flame led the faction that was against the Alik'r, he was ultimately defeated by the estranged warrior. In the Great Hall, the traveler confronted Sir Hughes who was surrounded by an ominous mist, which transports the champion into the dreams of Sir Hughes. The champion traversed the dream, witnessing Sir Hughes murdering Duchess Lakana in Alcaire. Deeper into the dream, the traveler defeated the &lt;a href=\"Omen%20of%20Fear\"&gt;Omen of Fear&lt;/a&gt;, a daedric entity that controlled Sir Hughes. The Knight was freed, and his fate is left unknown, largely left to the hands of the warrior. Sir Hughes was tormented by the Supernal Dreamers, a Daedric Cult to &lt;a href=\"Vaermina\"&gt;Vaermina&lt;/a&gt;. A new threat had revealed itself to Stormhaven.\nThe Man of Legend; Enter Hjalti Early-Beard.\nAlcaire has been the center of several myths; one such myth explains that a future leader would be born out of the Fiefdom of Alcaire, at one point or the other. During the waning years of the Interregnum, &lt;a href=\"King%20Cuhlecain\"&gt;King Cuhlecain&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"Falkreath\"&gt;Falkreath&lt;/a&gt; sought to unite the Kings of the &lt;a href=\"Colovian%20Estates\"&gt;Colovian Estates&lt;/a&gt;. But to do this, he needed to secure the northern borders near &lt;a href=\"the%20Reach\"&gt;the Reach&lt;/a&gt;, where the fortress of &lt;a href=\"Old%20Hroldan\"&gt;Old Hroldan&lt;/a&gt; was situated. Cuhlecain amassed a force consisting of Colovian Warriors and Nordic Berserkers under the leadership of &lt;a href=\"Hjalti%20Early-Beard\"&gt;Hjalti Early-Beard&lt;/a&gt;, a warrior from Alcaire. The &lt;a href=\"Battle%20of%20Old%20Hroldan\"&gt;Battle of Old Hroldan&lt;/a&gt; ended with Hjalti gaining victory when the warrior was able to destroy the gates of Hroldan with the power of the &lt;a href=\"Thu%27um\"&gt;Thu'um&lt;/a&gt;. The Nordic warriors were in awe and began to call Hjalti, &lt;a href=\"Talos\"&gt;Talos&lt;/a&gt;, which translates to Stormcrown. Hjalti changed his name to Tiber Septim and eventually started the &lt;a href=\"Third%20Empire\"&gt;Third Empire&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"Cyrodiil\"&gt;Cyrodiil&lt;/a&gt;, conquering the provinces of Tamriel and ushering in the &lt;a href=\"Third%20Era\"&gt;Third Era&lt;/a&gt;.\n&lt;a href=\"Third%20Era\"&gt;Third Era&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe Warp in the West; the Fiefdom of Alcaire.\nDuring the &lt;a href=\"Warp%20in%20the%20West\"&gt;Warp in the West&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"3E%20417\"&gt;3E 417&lt;/a&gt;, the Fiefdom of Alcaire was under the reign of an unknown Lord, whose name was lost in the history books. Alcaire existed among the forty-four different nations of the &lt;a href=\"Iliac%20Bay\"&gt;Iliac Bay&lt;/a&gt;. Alcaire itself is a coastal fiefdom not far from the &lt;a href=\"Kingdom%20of%20Wayrest\"&gt;Kingdom of Wayrest&lt;/a&gt;, one of the three major kingdoms of the Iliac Bay. Later in the same year, the Warp in the West had occurred, resulting in the Kingdoms expanding their territories, absorbing the smaller nations of the Iliac. The Fiefdom of Alcaire was annexed into the Kingdom of Wayrest along with other nations throughout the eastern Iliac Coast. Because of its location, the Fiefdom of Alcaire was the site of various battles between Wayrest and the nearby &lt;a href=\"Orsinium\"&gt;Orsinium&lt;/a&gt;, in the end, Wayrest prevailed and claimed Alcaire."}

I'm not sure I have the skill and experience to totally counteract its properties, but I have an idea for how to suppress and slow the pace of the disease. It will require a number of rare and exotic ingredients to pull this off, though.\nAn alchemical concoction such as I'm imagining doesn't like to be subjected to high heat. It's too volatile. It needs to be allowed to seep and brew. Therefore, an adjustment of one-quarter flame should suffice to get the mortar to the proper temperature.\nFirst, I'll need a good amount of &lt;a href=\"Kyne%27s%20Heart\"&gt;Kyne's Heart&lt;/a&gt;. These healing herbs are prized for their powerful medicinal properties, which makes them hard to come by and extremely expensive. I'm certain the &lt;a href=\"Lluther%20Serethran\"&gt;innkeeper&lt;/a&gt; at the &lt;a href=\"Brooding%20Elf%20Inn\"&gt;Brooding Elf&lt;/a&gt; keeps an emergency supply to sell for profit when business gets slow.\nThen, I need something to bind it all together and hide the foul taste of the bitter herbs. Something like sour milk tea. &lt;a href=\"Grell%20Flan\"&gt;Grell Flan&lt;/a&gt; was known to imbibe the stuff from time to time. I must admit that I have a fondess for the beverage myself. Usually with a splash of &lt;a href=\"Greef%20%28Online%29\"&gt;greef&lt;/a&gt; to give it a bit of a kick, if you must know.\nFinally, I'll need something that adds a touch of magic. Dragon scale mushrooms would fit the bill nicely. If I recall correctly, Old &lt;a href=\"Sorel%20Tedas\"&gt;Sorel Tedas&lt;/a&gt; had a taste for exotic mushrooms. There might still be some hidden in &lt;a href=\"Tedas%20House%20%28Quarantine%20Serk%29\"&gt;his house&lt;/a&gt; unless those Argonian ruffians ransacked his place after he entered the quarantine."}

Also, the number of properties identified per ingredient increases. Ingredients can be collected from creatures' body and plants, found in various containers in towns and buildings, and bought from individuals throughout the world. The simplest use, of the Alchemy skill, is to eat ingredients in order to experience the benefits (or harmful effect) of that ingredient, thereby learning its properties.\nThe skill level is increased upon successfully crafting a potion. When the progression of the current skill level reaches 100%, the skill level increases by 1.\nRacial bonuses.\nCertain &lt;a href=\"Races%20%28Morrowind%29\"&gt;races&lt;/a&gt; gain a one-time skill bonus during character creation;\nBooks.\nThe following books give you bonuses to your Alchemy Skill:\nMixing potions.\nAt a minimum, two ingredients with the one property in common are required to create a potion.

The effects of products produced by alchemy are varied in nature and potency, and depend on the ingredients used as well as the skill of the alchemist and the quality of the apparatus used.\nAdvancing the skill.\nThere are several ways to level up in alchemy, primarily by creating potions or poisons. Like and unlike , the increase in skill is not dependent on the the value or strength of the potions created. This mechanic lends itself to a strategy of creating many cheap potions. It takes twenty potion creations to raise alchemy one skill level. Since &lt;a href=\"Mercantile%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;Mercantile&lt;/a&gt; also only depends on the count of items sold and not their value, the Hero can efficiently level both by creating large numbers of cheap potions, selling them and repeating. Sampling raw ingredients and successfully combining ingredients raise the alchemy skill. &lt;a href=\"Skill%20Books%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;Skill Books&lt;/a&gt; can raise the Alchemy skill one time only, when read.\nAs with any other skill, alchemy &lt;a href=\"Trainers%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;training&lt;/a&gt; may be purchased.\nAlchemy menu.\nThe menu for creating potions or poisons in Oblivion is fairly simple. There are four boxes along the top of the menu. These display the &lt;a href=\"Apparatus%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;Alchemy Apparatuses&lt;/a&gt; currently held in the &lt;a href=\"inventory\"&gt;inventory&lt;/a&gt;. From right to left: &lt;a href=\"Mortar%20and%20Pestle\"&gt;Mortar and Pestle&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Retort\"&gt;Retort&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Alembic\"&gt;Alembic&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Calcinator\"&gt;Calcinator&lt;/a&gt;. These tools level from Novice to Master, coherent with the Hero's Alchemy &lt;a href=\"Leveling\"&gt;Mastery Level&lt;/a&gt;.\nThere are four slots for adding &lt;a href=\"Ingredients%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;ingredients&lt;/a&gt; from the inventory along the lower left side. Once one has been filled, ingredients with the same effects can only be added to the remaining slots. The Hero needs to be able to see an effect to make a potion with that effect. Potions cannot be made just by looking up effects on the ingredients page.\nFinally, the large box on the lower right shows the effects and level of the potion or poison to be created. Potion strength augments with each piece of apparatus used.\nClasses and races.\nClasses.\n&lt;a href=\"Classes%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;Classes&lt;/a&gt; utilizing the Alchemy skill include:\nRaces.\n&lt;a href=\"Races%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;Races&lt;/a&gt; given bonuses in Alchemy:"}

A skilled alchemist learns to experiment to find the combinations that will give the best results.\nMixing certain ingredients together can produce either beneficial, harmful, or a combination of both, effects in potions that imbue a temporary boost or loss to the drinker's statistics. An example is &lt;a href=\"Alchemy%20Recipes\"&gt;armor&lt;/a&gt; potion, which raises the &lt;a href=\"Vestige\"&gt;Vestige&lt;/a&gt;'s armor rating while lowering the Vestige's weapon damage.\n&lt;a href=\"Solvents\"&gt;Solvents&lt;/a&gt;.\nPotion solvents can be collected from small water springs labeled as &lt;a href=\"Pure%20Water%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Pure Water&lt;/a&gt; found in water reservoir edgings.

Each ingredient has four set effects. Each effect is labeled \"unknown\" until the &lt;a href=\"Last%20Dragonborn\"&gt;Dragonborn&lt;/a&gt; uses an Alchemy Lab to combine ingredients that share one or more effects. Those shared effects will then be revealed permanently for those ingredients in the future, and one or more relevant potions will be available in the Alchemy Lab menu screen for convenience. The first effect can also be revealed by 'eating' the ingredient, which immediately causes the effect on the Dragonborn after consumption. All ingredient effects are temporary, and only &lt;a href=\"Jarrin%20Root\"&gt;Jarrin Root&lt;/a&gt; is potentially fatal if eaten, making experimenting quite safe. With perks, all four effects can be found by eating a single ingredient.\nRecipes.\nAll alchemy &lt;a href=\"Merchants%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;merchants&lt;/a&gt; have recipes for sale in their shops. Recipes can also be found as loot. Recipes list ingredients that share a given effect which helps limit the experimentation required to find the effects of each ingredient. However, some of these recipes are inaccurate.\nAlchemy Labs.\nBrewing potions requires an &lt;a href=\"Alchemy%20Lab%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Alchemy Lab&lt;/a&gt;, which can be found in various locations throughout Skyrim, such as alchemy supply shops, private studies, some inns, court wizards' quarters, and can be purchased for owned homes. When interacting with an Alchemy Lab, the Dragonborn will see a menu. At the top is 'Ingredients', which opens a sub-menu which lists all the ingredients currently in the inventory. Below that is a list of all known effects on all ingredients in the inventory. Each of those open a sub-menu which lists only ingredients that share that effect. When all or part of the chosen ingredients fail to create an effect, attempting to combine the same ingredients again will darken the names of ingredients which were previously proven to produce nothing with the first ingredient selected.\nPotions and poisons.\nPotions and &lt;a href=\"Poison%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;poisons&lt;/a&gt; are &lt;a href=\"Items%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;items&lt;/a&gt; produced as a result of brewing at an Alchemy Lab. In typical parlance, potions affect the Dragonborn. Examples include those that increase the maximum of (\"&lt;a href=\"Fortify%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Fortify&lt;/a&gt;\"), &lt;a href=\"Regenerate%20Health%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;regenerate&lt;/a&gt; over time, or instantly replenish stats like &lt;a href=\"Stamina%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Stamina&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Magicka%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Magicka&lt;/a&gt;, or &lt;a href=\"Health%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Health&lt;/a&gt;. Potions can also increase the magnitude of spells cast and skills like &lt;a href=\"One-Handed%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;One-Handed&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"Smithing%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Smithing&lt;/a&gt;, or alter the Dragonborn with &lt;a href=\"Invisibility%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Invisibility&lt;/a&gt;.\nPoisons affect others. &lt;a href=\"Damage%20Health%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Damage Health&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Slow\"&gt;Slow&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Paralyze%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Paralyze&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Weakness%20to%20Fire%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Weakness to Fire&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Lingering%20Damage%20Magicka\"&gt;Lingering Damage Magicka&lt;/a&gt; are common examples of a poison's effects.\nA brewed potion always has a name describing its dominant effect. Unlike found potions, which can have alternate names and usually only one effect, brewed potions always have one consistent name, regardless of the number of effects contained. This can lead to some confusion when finding a potion to consume from the inventory. The value of a potion is derived from the number of effects and their magnitude, regardless of the utility of the potion. In fact, some craftable poisons can benefit the enemy, and some craftable potions can harm the Dragonborn. The Alchemy perk &lt;a href=\"%23Purity\"&gt;Purity&lt;/a&gt; removes this possibility for potions crafted in the future. Using a potion involves simply selecting it from the inventory, while poisons are applied to weapons such as a sword or a bow by equipping the weapon to be poisoned and then selecting a poison to apply to it.\nMixing effects will reduce the effectiveness of individual potions and poisons, depending on whether the beneficial effect or poison is dominant. (A poison in a pink bottle will be 20% less effective, while a beneficial potion in a green bottle will be 20% less effective.)\nThe most valuable potion known to date requires , and can be brewed at an Alchemy Lab by mixing &lt;a href=\"Garlic%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;garlic&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Nordic%20Barnacle\"&gt;nordic barnacle&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Salmon%20Roe\"&gt;salmon roe&lt;/a&gt;. The resulting potion regenerates health and magicka faster. It also allows the Dragonborn to breathe underwater.\nLeveling.\nThe following actions raise the Alchemy skill:\nBooks.\nThe following books provide a permanent one-time increase to the Dragonborn's Alchemy skill. See each book's page for a list of possible locations.\nQuests.\nThe following quests increase or help to increase the Alchemy skill:\nPerks.\nThe following are &lt;a href=\"Perks%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;perks&lt;/a&gt; that become available to select as the skill is leveled up:\n&lt;onlyinclude&gt;\n&lt;/onlyinclude&gt;"}

My own master would never abide such abject incompetence! \"Can't take instruction,\" she'd say. \"Nose in a book,\" she'd say. Luckily for your prospects, it is far less costly to write this simple manual than replace yet another cask of rare solvent.\nIf you lose this manual, as I know you will, don't despair. I have invested your annual stipend toward printing multiple copies of this book and distributing them far and wide. In time, every alchemy station in &lt;a href=\"Tamriel\"&gt;Tamriel&lt;/a&gt; shall have one.\nStep One: Acquire &lt;a href=\"Solvents\"&gt;Solvents&lt;/a&gt;\nYou already know that every potion requires a solvent to serve as the potion's base. If you ever paid attention to my lessons, you'd know the best solvent is clean water from a natural source. The purity of the water determines the quality of the potion, so the best sources are natural springs.\nI must once again emphasize the need for fresh sources of water. Remember that incident with the healing draught? You cannot simply dip a flask into a stagnant pond, an ocean cove, or downstream from a tannery. I suppose you could find bottles of clean water about town, but it is best to do the work yourself.\nIncidentally, your \"rain barrel solvent\" will never work. You are to cease your experiments immediately.\nStep Two: Acquire &lt;a href=\"Reagents\"&gt;Reagents&lt;/a&gt;\nAlchemy is a study of combinations. Where solvents are a potion's base, reagents are the active &lt;a href=\"Ingredients%20%28Online%29\"&gt;ingredients&lt;/a&gt;. Each reagent bears four unique traits. I'm disinclined to explain the principles of quadratic amalgamation to you\u2014again\u2014but do try to remember the basics: match like with like.\nHenceforth, you are to find all reagents in the wilds\u2014not in my laboratory! Remember to look for plants and mushrooms. Plants and mushrooms, only! Under no circumstances should you deviate from this. \"Squirrel powder\" was an abomination against the Eight.\nFurthermore, I must remind you to thoroughly clean both &lt;a href=\"Mortar%20and%20Pestle\"&gt;Mortar &amp; Pestle&lt;/a&gt; after their use.\nStep Three: Craft Potions\nBring a solvent and two reagents to any alchemy station. Different reagents are required, a fact I must stress once again. Combining &lt;a href=\"Bugloss\"&gt;Bugloss&lt;/a&gt; with Bugloss gets you nothing but foul-tasting water.\nWhen you have what you need, put them together and craft your potion. Reagents with positive trait combinations will produce helpful potions, while those with negative trait combinations can cause harm to whoever is foolish enough to imbibe them. If none of your reagents' traits match, you lose both solvent and reagents.\nExperiment with different reagents to see what you can produce. I leave it to you to determine their traits, but will remind you that ingesting a reagent can teach you its most basic trait. Just one\u2014don't gorge yourself!\nWhile I recall of it, did you expect I wouldn't know you'd finished off the &lt;a href=\"Nirnroot%20%28Online%29\"&gt;nirnroot&lt;/a&gt;? I could hear your teeth singing, and there's no way to hide a glowing chamberpot.\nAdvanced Alchemical Principles\nOnly when you master the basics of alchemy should you think to complicate the process. Through careful study you can learn to suppress negative traits when crafting potions, craft multiple potions from the simple set of reagents, or even combine additional reagents to produce more powerful potions!\nBut for now, \"not poisoning yourself\" is the goal I'd most like you to achieve."}

These include:\nGiant's Toe.\nGiant's Toes cause any potion with a duration to have its duration increased to 300 seconds, greatly increasing the potion's value. Additionally, when used in a &lt;a href=\"Fortify%20Health%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Fortify Health&lt;/a&gt; potion, Giant's Toes provide a much greater increase to health than other ingredients with that effect. With a high enough Alchemy skill, Giant's Toes can produce Fortify Health potions worth more than 4,000 .\nRiver Betty &amp; Deathbell.\nRiver Betty increases poison damage on Damage Health potions by a large margin, more than doubling the regular damage at higher levels. While not as significant of a boost, Deathbells add roughly 50% the poison damage, and are far more common. \nSalmon Roe.\nSalmon Roe has extremely powerful Fortify Magicka and Waterbreathing effects that are several times stronger than other ingredients. The potion's powerful magical effects make its line of potions the most expensive of all potions.\nLess Effective Combinations.\nSome ingredient mixtures produce weaker effects than normal, despite having no mixed effects. The exact cause of this is unknown. \nProcess for leveling.\nMaking many potions at a time is an effective method for leveling.\nNote: While &lt;a href=\"Fortify%20Barter\"&gt;fortify barter&lt;/a&gt; modifies the selling price of your potions, it does not modify their base value. Thus, fortify barter enchantments and potions will not affect your leveling speed.\nMaking money.\nOverview.\nAlchemy is arguably the most time and cost efficient way to make money in Skyrim. Profit gained is determined by:\nTo reach level 100 Alchemy, approximately 200,000 septims worth of potions needs to be brewed. As early as level 10, potions worth over 1,000 can be crafted. For example: &lt;a href=\"Falmer%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Falmer&lt;/a&gt; infested dungeons contain many &lt;a href=\"Chaurus%20Eggs\"&gt;Chaurus Eggs&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Luna%20Moth%20Wing\"&gt;Luna Moth Wing&lt;/a&gt;s can be obtained outside throughtout Skyrim at night. These result in valuable &lt;a href=\"Invisibility%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Invisibility&lt;/a&gt; potions. Additionally, the combination of &lt;a href=\"Salmon%20roe\"&gt;Salmon roe&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Garlic\"&gt;Garlic&lt;/a&gt;, and a &lt;a href=\"Nordic%20Barnacle\"&gt;Nordic Barnacle&lt;/a&gt; make the most expensive base potion, but this requires .\nExpenses.\nPurchasing raw materials from vendors is generally efficient, because it avoids much of the time cost of finding raw materials in the wild. However, for rare ingredients, a lot of time can be lost traveling to specific merchants.\nBuying all ingredients less than 60 septims from vendors creates an astronomically high return ratio for even the weakest of potion types. There is almost no correlation between ingredient cost or rarity and the value of potions crafted with them.\nAnother way to cover beginning expenses, along with slightly increasing the player's alchemy level, is to take all the the &lt;a href=\"Spider%20Egg%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Spider Eggs&lt;/a&gt; during the tutorial, and to catch all the &lt;a href=\"Blue%20Butterfly\"&gt;Blue Butterflies&lt;/a&gt; outside between &lt;a href=\"Riverwood%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Riverwood&lt;/a&gt; and Whiterun. The brewing stand at Arcadia's Cauldron can be used to brew them together. The gold made there can pay for additional ingredients for more valuable potions.\n&lt;a href=\"Houses%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Houses (Skyrim)&lt;/a&gt;, especially an inexpensive one like &lt;a href=\"Breezehome\"&gt;Breezehome&lt;/a&gt;, provide a convenient storage location for potions, ingredients, and buff equipment.\nHomestead gardening.\nWith the DLC, &lt;a href=\"Homestead%20%28Hearthfire%29\"&gt;Homestead&lt;/a&gt;s can be built with a &lt;a href=\"Homestead%20%28Hearthfire%29%23Garden\"&gt;garden&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Homestead%20%28Hearthfire%29%23Greenhouse\"&gt;greenhouse&lt;/a&gt;. Ingredients planted there can be harvested every 3 days. For 5000 septims and respect from the &lt;a href=\"Jarl\"&gt;Jarl&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Morthal\"&gt;Morthal&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Falkreath\"&gt;Falkreath&lt;/a&gt;, or &lt;a href=\"Dawnstar\"&gt;Dawnstar&lt;/a&gt;, a &lt;a href=\"Small%20House\"&gt;Small House&lt;/a&gt; and a garden with 11 patches of fertile soil can be built. Owning all 3 Homesteads, for 33 total patches of soil, is enough to make more potions than can be sold without additional &lt;a href=\"Speech\"&gt;Speech&lt;/a&gt; perks.\nBy using the most efficient configuration (8 plots &lt;a href=\"Creep%20Cluster\"&gt;Creep Cluster&lt;/a&gt;, 8 plots of &lt;a href=\"Mora%20Tapinella\"&gt;Mora Tapinella&lt;/a&gt;, and 13 plots of &lt;a href=\"Scaly%20Pholiota\"&gt;Scaly Pholiota&lt;/a&gt;), the Dragonborn can expect to create 39 potions per harvest.\nWith four \"peerless\" (25%) &lt;a href=\"Fortify%20Alchemy\"&gt;fortify alchemy&lt;/a&gt; items of clothing and jewelry, the Dragonborn can level Alchemy from 15 to 100 with 221 Fortify Health potions created from this combination of plants.\nBrewing process.\nThe same general tips used for leveling are applicable for improving the profitability of potions, as Alchemy leveling is determined by potion value.\nSales and trade routes.\nEach vendor has a limited amount of gold, and it is possible to empty a vendor's till with a single potion. The Thieves' Guild fences have deeper pockets (up to 4,000 septims), but very valuable potions will drain even those quite quickly. A merchant's gold and inventory replenishes after 48 in-game hours. A long, cyclic trade route will allow every vendor to have time to replenish.\nAlternatively, there is an exploit that involves buying out a merchant, saving, attacking them, and reloading the save to reset their gold and inventory as needed. This saves considerable time versus fast traveling between vendors."}

Ald'ruhn is a unique settlement in the Dark Elven province, built from the foundation of the carcass of &lt;a href=\"Skar\"&gt;Skar&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"Emperor%20Crab\"&gt;Emperor Crab&lt;/a&gt; of legend. The crab was defeated by the combined forces of &lt;a href=\"House%20Hleran\"&gt;House Hleran&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Ashlanders\"&gt;Ashlanders&lt;/a&gt;.\nGeography.\nThe original Ashlander camp called Ald'ruhn was vast, occupying the hills in between the Ashlands of &lt;a href=\"Red%20Mountain\"&gt;Red Mountain&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"West%20Gash\"&gt;West Gash&lt;/a&gt;. The area around Skar served as the meeting grounds, with a large campfire in the center of the camp. West from the campsite were fewer yurts and open areas for the herders of Vvardenfell. Dirt paths surrounded the main campsite which lead into shrines of the four Great Ashlander Tribes of the sub-continent. A road south of Ald'ruhn leads into the Daedric ruins of &lt;a href=\"Ramimilk\"&gt;Ramimilk&lt;/a&gt;. Several landmarks surround the camp including the &lt;a href=\"Foyada%20Drura\"&gt;Foyada Drura&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Hleran%20Ancestral%20Tomb\"&gt;Hleran Ancestral Tomb&lt;/a&gt;. As time went on, the Dark Elves of &lt;a href=\"House%20Redoran\"&gt;House Redoran&lt;/a&gt; had begun to inhabit the area, establishing the Great City of Ald'ruhn. Skar was refurbished as the Manor District of the town, and the yurts were replaced with the traditional Redoran homes. The new residents of Ald'ruhn created walls surrounding the city, protecting the city from the ash storms of the region.\nThe former campsite was remade as the town square of the Ald'ruhn city, and the rest of the city revolves around this area. The road leading into the Ald'ruhn Manor District has several artisan services ranging from the libraries or the blacksmiths of House Redoran. The entrance of Ald'ruhn has twin watchtowers overlooking the area, and it leads to the southern town square, with the local &lt;a href=\"Mages%20Guild\"&gt;Mages Guild&lt;/a&gt; chapter and &lt;a href=\"the%20Rat%20in%20the%20Pot\"&gt;the Rat in the Pot&lt;/a&gt; Tavern occupying the area. Northwestern Ald'ruhn is the home to several societal businesses including the &lt;a href=\"Ald%20Skar%20Inn\"&gt;Ald Skar Inn&lt;/a&gt; and the Council Club for House Redoran in Vvardenfell. Eastern Ald'ruhn has various residential buildings lacking walls to protect it. The center of the area is the &lt;a href=\"Ald%27ruhn%20Temple\"&gt;Ald'ruhn Temple&lt;/a&gt;, the local place of worship for the &lt;a href=\"Tribunal%20Temple\"&gt;Tribunal Temple&lt;/a&gt;. North of the temple is a private estate to the nobles of House Redoran.\nHistory.\n&lt;a href=\"First%20Era\"&gt;First Era&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe Battle against Skar; the Ashlander's Ald'ruhn.\nThe sub-continent of Vvardenfell and overall Morrowind has housed all sorts of alien creatures, varying in sizes. The &lt;a href=\"Silt%20Strider\"&gt;Silt Strider&lt;/a&gt; has remained throughout the eras but the bugs that House Redoran have used no longer exists and so on. A large species of crab called the &lt;a href=\"Emperor%20Crab\"&gt;Emperor Crab&lt;/a&gt; had lived on Vvardenfell during the time of the &lt;a href=\"Chimer\"&gt;Chimer&lt;/a&gt;, and the most dangerous one was &lt;a href=\"Skar\"&gt;Skar&lt;/a&gt;. Skar terrorized the residents of Vvardenfell, which was mainly the Ashlanders. It took the combined forces of all the Ashlanders and a champion of &lt;a href=\"House%20Hleran\"&gt;House Hleran&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Dranoth%20Hleran\"&gt;Dranoth Hleran&lt;/a&gt;, to take out the large beast. Dranoth had utilized a powerful spear called the &lt;a href=\"Calderas\"&gt;Calderas&lt;/a&gt;, which became a legend afterward. The carcass of Skar was refurbished as a meeting place for the Ashlanders of Vvardenfell, should anything affect their home, they can convene in the newly-established settlement named Ald'ruhn.\n&lt;a href=\"Second%20Era\"&gt;Second Era&lt;/a&gt;.\nAncestral Ties to Ald'ruhn; Enter Drelyth Hleran.\nDuring the &lt;a href=\"Interregnum\"&gt;Interregnum&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"2E%20583\"&gt;2E 583&lt;/a&gt;, the meeting grounds of Ald'ruhn was visited by &lt;a href=\"Drelyth%20Hleran\"&gt;Drelyth Hleran&lt;/a&gt;, a member of House Hleran whose ancestry had ties to the settlement. Drelyth attempted to commune with the Ashlanders inhabiting the camp, but they would not talk to him, believing he was untrustworthy. The Dark Elf had asked another adventurer known as the &lt;a href=\"Vestige\"&gt;Vestige&lt;/a&gt; to help him negotiate with the Ashlanders and to uncover the truth. The Vestige spoke with &lt;a href=\"Farseer%20Kuamta\"&gt;Farseer Kuamta&lt;/a&gt;, who gave the warrior a blessing and directed them to the four shrines of the Ashlander tribes. With the blessings, the Vestige talked with &lt;a href=\"Wise%20Woman%20Asani\"&gt;Wise Woman Asani&lt;/a&gt; and was shown the way to the &lt;a href=\"Hleran%20Ancestral%20Tomb\"&gt;Hleran Ancestral Tomb&lt;/a&gt;, where they communed with the spirit of Dranoth Hleran. After proving their pure intent, Dranoth bestowed the Vestige with the legendary spear named Calderas. The traveler than gave Drelyth the spear and with the weapon, the Ashlanders trusted the Hleran Elf, and other Dark Elves of Vvardenfell began to commune with the local Ashlanders. This event was the beginning of the Great City of Ald'ruhn.\nThe False Nerevarine; Conoon Chodala of Urshilaku.\nAround the same time, &lt;a href=\"Conoon%20Chodala\"&gt;Conoon Chodala&lt;/a&gt; was the Ashkhan of the &lt;a href=\"Urshilaku%20Tribe\"&gt;Urshilaku Tribe&lt;/a&gt; in Vvardenfell. He claimed that he was, in fact, the &lt;a href=\"Nerevarine\"&gt;Nerevarine&lt;/a&gt;, and in his hubris he allied with the &lt;a href=\"Red%20Exiles\"&gt;Red Exiles&lt;/a&gt;, an exiled group of Ashlanders to harass the tribes of Vvardenfell, so that they can accept Chodala as the Nerevarine of Morrowind. Chodala's sister, &lt;a href=\"Seryn%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Seryna&lt;/a&gt; attempted to convince Chodala to stop his wrath, but was ignored by her brother. Seryn work along with the Vestige to convince Chodala to end his masquerade, and so they traveled to the &lt;a href=\"Cavern%20of%20the%20Incarnate\"&gt;Cavern of the Incarnate&lt;/a&gt;, where they would commune with the &lt;a href=\"Failed%20Incarnate\"&gt;Failed Incarnate&lt;/a&gt;s, to create a convincing argument against Chodala. At a meeting in Ald'ruhn, the claims were put against Chodala but he dismissed them, attacking the Ashlanders in Ald'ruhn in retaliation. Chodala had been absorbing &lt;a href=\"Vivec\"&gt;Vivec's&lt;/a&gt; powers, causing much distress in Vvardenfell. It was revealed later that Chodala was under the influence of &lt;a href=\"Barbas\"&gt;Barbas&lt;/a&gt;, who attempted to find the entrance to the &lt;a href=\"Clockwork%20City\"&gt;Clockwork City&lt;/a&gt;. They were both stopped by the Vestige, Seryn and &lt;a href=\"Barilzar\"&gt;Barilzar&lt;/a&gt;.\n&lt;a href=\"Third%20Era\"&gt;Third Era&lt;/a&gt;.\nOld Run during the Imperial Simulacrum.\nDuring the &lt;a href=\"Imperial%20Simulacrum\"&gt;Imperial Simulacrum&lt;/a&gt; from &lt;a href=\"3E%20389\"&gt;3E 389&lt;/a&gt; to &lt;a href=\"3E%20399\"&gt;3E 399&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Emperor\"&gt;Emperor&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Uriel%20Septim%20VII\"&gt;Uriel Septim VII&lt;/a&gt; was imprisoned along with &lt;a href=\"Talin%20Warhaft\"&gt;Talin Warhaft&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;a href=\"Deadlands\"&gt;Deadlands&lt;/a&gt; by &lt;a href=\"Jagar%20Tharn\"&gt;Jagar Tharn&lt;/a&gt;. Tharn planned for months to capture the throne, and he was able to achieve so in the span of ten years. Tharn had a powerful weapon called the &lt;a href=\"Staff%20of%20Chaos\"&gt;Staff of Chaos&lt;/a&gt;, and he split it into nine pieces and scattered them across Tamriel, the staff was the only thing keeping Uriel Septim and Warhaft in &lt;a href=\"Oblivion\"&gt;Oblivion&lt;/a&gt;. A warrior escaped his clutches and traveled all corners of Tamriel to retrieve the missing pieces. The hero was known as the &lt;a href=\"Eternal%20Champion\"&gt;Eternal Champion&lt;/a&gt;, and he assembled the staff and defeated Jagar Tharn at the &lt;a href=\"Imperial%20Palace\"&gt;Imperial Palace&lt;/a&gt;. The Eternal Champion had at one point visited the town of Old Run in their quest to recover the pieces.\nThe True Nerevarine; Duel against Bolvyn Venim.\nDuring the &lt;a href=\"Vvardenfell%20Crisis\"&gt;Vvardenfell Crisis&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"3E%20427\"&gt;3E 427&lt;/a&gt;, the actual &lt;a href=\"Nerevarine\"&gt;Nerevarine&lt;/a&gt; had revealed themselves and had begun their quest to fulfill the &lt;a href=\"Nerevarine%20Prophecy\"&gt;Nerevarine Prophecy&lt;/a&gt;. Parts of the prophecy must have the Nerevarine attempt the Great Houses of Vvardenfell and made their attempt to persuade the Councilors of House Redoran to name them the &lt;a href=\"Hortator\"&gt;Hortator&lt;/a&gt; of the Great House Redoran. The warrior traveled to the city of Ald'ruhn, the House Redoran capital of Vvardenfell to speak with &lt;a href=\"Bolvyn%20Venim\"&gt;Bolvyn Venim&lt;/a&gt;, the Archmaster of House Redoran. Despite their proof, Venim refused to name the Nerevarine the Hortator and so the only way it can be dissolved was for the champion to duel Bolvyn Venim. And so, both warriors traveled to the city of &lt;a href=\"Vivec%20City\"&gt;Vivec&lt;/a&gt; and dueled each other, with the Nerevarine claiming victory. After convincing the other Councilors, the warrior was named the Hortator of the Great House Redoran, being one step closer to fulfilling the prophecy.\nRemember Redoran; the Fall of Ald'ruhn.\nDuring the &lt;a href=\"Oblivion%20Crisis\"&gt;Oblivion Crisis&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"3E%20433\"&gt;3E 433&lt;/a&gt;, the city-state of Ald'ruhn was besieged by the &lt;a href=\"Daedric\"&gt;Daedric&lt;/a&gt; forces of &lt;a href=\"Oblivion\"&gt;Oblivion&lt;/a&gt;. The Fall of Ald'ruhn is one of the most well-known battles of the conflict. The battle was in favor of the Daedra, House Redoran was in a losing fight, and so, the conjurers of Ald'ruhn had resurrected the great Emperor Crab, &lt;a href=\"Skar\"&gt;Skar&lt;/a&gt;. However, even the mighty crustacean of Skar was unable to defeat the invading force. The city of Ald'ruhn was lost, and the Daedric Armies advanced deep into the Ashlands to &lt;a href=\"Ghostgate\"&gt;Ghostgate&lt;/a&gt;, attempting to break the gate. It is unknown whether the Daedric Forces broke the gate, but in the end, the Oblivion Crisis was adverted when &lt;a href=\"Martin%20Septim\"&gt;Martin Septim&lt;/a&gt; had sacrificed himself to defeat &lt;a href=\"Mehrunes%20Dagon\"&gt;Mehrunes Dagon&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;a href=\"Imperial%20City\"&gt;Imperial City&lt;/a&gt;.\n&lt;a href=\"Fourth%20Era\"&gt;Fourth Era&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe Red Year &amp; Raven Rock.\nIn &lt;a href=\"4E%205\"&gt;4E 5&lt;/a&gt;, the province of Morrowind had undergone a very severe disaster where the &lt;a href=\"Ministry%20of%20Truth\"&gt;Ministry of Truth&lt;/a&gt; had crashed onto the city of Vivec and &lt;a href=\"Red%20Mountain\"&gt;Red Mountain&lt;/a&gt; had erupted, destroying the sub-continent of Vvardenfell and the settlements inhabiting the region. Ald'ruhn was destroyed amidst the conflict. Before this, after the Oblivion Crisis, the Great Houses had sent small groups to spread throughout the province. One of the House Redoran groups was led by &lt;a href=\"Brara%20Morvayn\"&gt;Brara Morvayn&lt;/a&gt;, who lived in Ald'ruhn and was a member of the Redoran Council. Morvayn had immediately traveled to the island of &lt;a href=\"Solstheim\"&gt;Solstheim&lt;/a&gt; and took refuge in the &lt;a href=\"Imperial\"&gt;Imperial&lt;/a&gt; township of &lt;a href=\"Raven%20Rock\"&gt;Raven Rock&lt;/a&gt;. After several negotiations, Raven Rock had integrated the Great House Redoran into their society, making the mining town flourish even more than before. Brara eventually became the leader of Raven Rock, and House Redoran had claimed full ownership of the town, after passing away from old age. Her son, &lt;a href=\"Lleril%20Morvayn\"&gt;Lleril Morvayn&lt;/a&gt; took up the position of the Councilor of Raven Rock. Meanwhile, in &lt;a href=\"Mournhold\"&gt;Mournhold&lt;/a&gt;, a House Redoran had undergone a relief effort to rebuild the settlements of Vvardenfell including Ald'ruhn. It is unknown if it was completely rebuilt."}

It is the district seat of &lt;a href=\"House%20Redoran%20%28Morrowind%29\"&gt;House Redoran&lt;/a&gt;, one of the Dunmer great houses. The &lt;a href=\"Redoran%20Council%20Hall\"&gt;Redoran Council Hall&lt;/a&gt; is located inside &lt;a href=\"Ald%27ruhn-under-Skar\"&gt;Ald'ruhn-under-Skar&lt;/a&gt;, the shell of an ancient giant dead &lt;a href=\"Emperor%20Crab\"&gt;crab&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href=\"Imperials%20%28Morrowind%29\"&gt;Imperial&lt;/a&gt;-constructed roads lead north to the villages of &lt;a href=\"Maar%20Gan\"&gt;Maar Gan&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Gnisis%20%28Morrowind%29\"&gt;Gnisis&lt;/a&gt;, and south to the major city known as &lt;a href=\"Balmora%20%28Morrowind%29\"&gt;Balmora&lt;/a&gt;, the district seat of &lt;a href=\"House%20Hlaalu%20%28Morrowind%29\"&gt;House Hlaalu&lt;/a&gt;. Ald'ruhn is one of the largest settlements in &lt;a href=\"Vvardenfell%20%28Morrowind%29\"&gt;Vvardenfell&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe three principal districts were Ald'ruhn town, Ald'ruhn-under-Skar, and &lt;a href=\"Buckmoth%20Legion%20Fort\"&gt;Fort Buckmoth&lt;/a&gt;. Ald'ruhn town was a large settlement in the Redoran village style, built of local materials, with organic curves and undecorated exteriors inspired by the landscape and by the shells of giant, native insects. Most guildhalls, cornerclubs, and merchants were sited in the southwest corner of the city, conveniently close to the West Gate and the &lt;a href=\"Silt%20Strider%20%28Morrowind%29\"&gt;Silt Strider&lt;/a&gt; port, while the Temple was located on high ground to the east, and was surrounded by a residential section. Ald'ruhn-under-Skar was the most distinctive architectural feature of Ald'ruhn, a manor and council district sheltered beneath the shell of an ancient, extinct giant crab. The large carapace enclosed a central dome, from which radiated the entrances to the &lt;a href=\"Redoran%20Council%20Chamber\"&gt;Redoran Council Chamber&lt;/a&gt;s, the manors of the Redoran Councillors, and the shops of a few upscale merchants. Buckmoth Fort was the &lt;a href=\"Imperial%20Legion%20%28Morrowind%29\"&gt;Imperial Legion&lt;/a&gt; garrison for the district. The strong walls and towers of this Imperial fortress were located a short distance to the south of the Ald'ruhn town, through the South Gate and behind the &lt;a href=\"Mages%20Guild%20%28Morrowind%29\"&gt;Mage Guild&lt;/a&gt;.\nAld'ruhn was the site of a massive battle between the Dunmer forces of &lt;a href=\"House%20Redoran%20%28Morrowind%29\"&gt;House Redoran&lt;/a&gt;, assisted by the Imperial Legion and the other great houses, and the &lt;a href=\"Daedric%20Forces%20of%20Destruction\"&gt;Daedric Forces of Destruction&lt;/a&gt;. The Dunmer were defeated as the majority of their forces were away fighting against the &lt;a href=\"Nords%20%28Morrowind%29\"&gt;Nords&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"Skyrim\"&gt;Skyrim&lt;/a&gt;. The great siege crawler destroyed Ald'ruhn, but the fate of the Redoran Councilors and Fort Buckmoth remains unknown.\nSublocations and districts.\nAld'ruhn Town.\nAld'ruhn town was the largest residential section of Ald'ruhn, and was a large settlement in the Redoran village style, built of local materials, with organic curves and undecorated exteriors inspired by the landscape and by the shells of giant native insects. Most guildhalls, cornerclubs, and merchants were sited in the southwest corner of the town, conveniently located next to the West Gate and the Silt Strider port, while the Temple was located on high ground to the east, and surrounded by the main part of the residential section.\nIn the northern section of Ald'ruhn town, clustered around the giant dread emperor crab shell that contained the Ald'ruhn-under-Skar district, were a few traders, a bookseller, and a rugged outdoor smithy. To the west lied the council club of the &lt;a href=\"Camonna%20Tong%20%28Morrowind%29\"&gt;Camonna Tong&lt;/a&gt;, an infamous criminal syndicate native to Morrowind, and the &lt;a href=\"Ald%20Skar%20Inn\"&gt;Ald Skar Inn&lt;/a&gt;. Inside the Ald Skar Inn, more traders, including the &lt;a href=\"Ashlanders%20%28Morrowind%29\"&gt;Ashlander&lt;/a&gt; merchant &lt;a href=\"Hassour%20Zainsubani\"&gt;Hassour Zainsubani&lt;/a&gt;, have set up shop and hawk their wares to the residents of the inn. On the eastern-most side of Ald'ruhn town was a large &lt;a href=\"Tribunal\"&gt;Tribunal&lt;/a&gt; temple with shrines to &lt;a href=\"Vivec%20%28Morrowind%29\"&gt;Vivec&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Almalexia%20%28Tribunal%29\"&gt;Almalexia&lt;/a&gt;, and Sotha Sil within. Tribunal priests would bless parishioners and pilgrims who visited the temple. Surrounding the temple, was a large residential section that contained many of the residential houses of the middle and lower classes, as well as the &lt;a href=\"Morvayn%20Manor%20%28Morrowind%29\"&gt;Morvayn Manor&lt;/a&gt;.\nJust within the West Gate, and centered around a dust-swept plaza, were the &lt;a href=\"Fighters%20Guild%20%28Morrowind%29\"&gt;Fighters Guild&lt;/a&gt;, and the &lt;a href=\"Mages%20Guild%20%28Morrowind%29\"&gt;Mages Guild&lt;/a&gt;. Also facing guild square was the &lt;a href=\"The%20Rat%20in%20the%20Pot\"&gt;The Rat in the Pot&lt;/a&gt; Inn, a local &lt;a href=\"Thieves%20Guild%20%28Morrowind%29\"&gt;Thieves Guild&lt;/a&gt; hangout, and the site of their dealings in Ald'ruhn. Many high-ranking representatives of the Morrowind branch of the Thieves Guild could be found here. The Silt Strider port was located just along the wall that protected the city from &lt;a href=\"Ashlanders%20%28Morrowind%29\"&gt;Ashlander&lt;/a&gt; and beast incursions, as well as shielding the city from the frequent Ash Storms that descended upon the city from &lt;a href=\"Red%20Mountain\"&gt;Red Mountain&lt;/a&gt;. Ald'ruhn suffered a brief scare when the Morvayn Manor was assaulted and occupied by &lt;a href=\"Ash%20Vampire\"&gt;Ash Vampire&lt;/a&gt;s, but was saved by the timely intervention of the &lt;a href=\"Nerevarine\"&gt;Nerevarine&lt;/a&gt;.\nAld'ruhn-under-Skar.\nAld'ruhn-under-Skar, also known as the Manor District or just Under-Skar, was the most distinctive architectural feature of Ald'ruhn, and was a manor and council district sheltered beneath the shell of an ancient, extinct giant dead emperor crab. The crab's large carapace enclosed a central dome, from which radiated the entrances to the Redoran Council chambers, the manors of the House Redoran councilors, and the shops of a few upscale merchants who offer their services to the &lt;a href=\"House%20Redoran%20%28Morrowind%29\"&gt;House Redoran&lt;/a&gt; Councilors and their families and servants. Most of the services provided by the &lt;a href=\"Dunmer%20%28Morrowind%29\"&gt;Dunmer&lt;/a&gt; Great House Redoran were located in the Council House and Councilors' manors of Ald'ruhn-under-Skar. All six Redoran councilors, including &lt;a href=\"Brara%20Morvayn\"&gt;Brara Morvayn&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Hlaren%20Ramoran\"&gt;Hlaren Ramoran&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Athyn%20Sarethi\"&gt;Athyn Sarethi&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Garisa%20Llethri\"&gt;Garisa Llethri&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Miner%20Arobar\"&gt;Miner Arobar&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Bolvyn%20Venim%20%28Morrowind%29\"&gt;Bolvyn Venim&lt;/a&gt;, have manor residences in Ald'ruhn-under-Skar.\nThe mansions of most Redoran councilors could be found on the upper portion of the Manor District. On the bottom portion of the giant dread emperor crab shell, several upscale merchants including a clothier, an alchemist, and an enchanter, had set up shop and sold their goods and services to the members of the Great House Redoran. The enchanter located here was one of the most renowned in &lt;a href=\"Vvardenfell%20%28Morrowind%29\"&gt;Vvardenfell&lt;/a&gt;, a region in &lt;a href=\"Morrowind\"&gt;Morrowind&lt;/a&gt;, and provided the Redoran mages with a wide array of spells and incantations, as well as useful &lt;a href=\"magicka\"&gt;magicka&lt;/a&gt;l items. The Redoran Council chamber held training facilities where their warriors were trained before being sent off to fight against the &lt;a href=\"Nords%20%28Morrowind%29\"&gt;Nordic&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Ashlanders%20%28Morrowind%29\"&gt;Ashlander&lt;/a&gt;, and Sixth House incursions that became normal during the &lt;a href=\"Third%20Era\"&gt;Third Era&lt;/a&gt;. The Council chambers also provided guest rooms and services for traveling members of House Redoran, and was the temporary home of the Redoran Councilor, Brara Morvayn.\nAlso in Ald'ruhn-under-Skar, the &lt;a href=\"Morag%20Tong%20%28Morrowind%29\"&gt;Morag Tong&lt;/a&gt;, an infamous assassination guild responsible for the murders of the Akaviri Potentates of the Reman Empire, had set up a base of operations from which to serve House Redoran. &lt;a href=\"Goren%20Andarys\"&gt;Goren Andarys&lt;/a&gt; headed up this section of the guild, and actively recruited members from the local Dunmer population in and around Ald'ruhn-under-Skar. Even though Ald'ruhn-under-Skar was the most actively patrolled region of Ald'ruhn by the House Redoran warriors, the Manor District experienced the most crime as the wealthy manors of the Redoran councilors attracted many thieves interested in the money, jewelry, and extravagant clothing held within the manors.\nFort Buckmoth.\nBuckmoth Fort, also known as &lt;a href=\"Buckmoth%20Legion%20Fort\"&gt;Fort Buckmoth&lt;/a&gt;, was the Imperial Legion garrison for the district under the control of the &lt;a href=\"Dunmer%20%28Morrowind%29\"&gt;Dunmer&lt;/a&gt; Great &lt;a href=\"House%20Redoran%20%28Morrowind%29\"&gt;House Redoran&lt;/a&gt;. The strong walls and towers of this &lt;a href=\"Imperials%20%28Morrowind%29\"&gt;Imperial&lt;/a&gt;-constructed fortress lay a short distance to the south of the main district of Ald'ruhn, Ald'ruhn Town, through the South Gate behind the &lt;a href=\"Mages%20Guild%20%28Morrowind%29\"&gt;Mages Guild&lt;/a&gt;. Located due south of the main sections of Ald'ruhn and west of the &lt;a href=\"Ramimilk%20Shrine\"&gt;Ramimilk Shrine&lt;/a&gt;, a Daedric shrine devoted to the Daedric Prince &lt;a href=\"Molag%20Bal\"&gt;Molag Bal&lt;/a&gt;, and on the road to the &lt;a href=\"Ghostgate\"&gt;Ghostgate&lt;/a&gt;, Fort Buckmoth served as the first line of defense of Ald'ruhn if it were to come under attack, and guarded it from any attacks coming from &lt;a href=\"Dagoth%20Ur%20%28Character%29\"&gt;Dagoth Ur&lt;/a&gt;'s forces based around &lt;a href=\"Red%20Mountain\"&gt;Red Mountain&lt;/a&gt;.\nMany Imperial sponsored merchants had taken up offices within Fort Buckmoth, making their services and goods available to the Imperial Legion for reasonable prices. These merchants included an enchanter, general goods merchant, apothecary, healer, drillmaster, battlemage, and smith. Fort Buckmoth was also home to an &lt;a href=\"Imperial%20Cult\"&gt;Imperial Cult&lt;/a&gt; shrine which contained an altar where the &lt;a href=\"Nine%20Divines\"&gt;Nine Divines&lt;/a&gt; could be worshiped. &lt;a href=\"Imsin%20the%20Dreamer\"&gt;Imsin the Dreamer&lt;/a&gt;, a &lt;a href=\"Nords%20%28Morrowind%29\"&gt;Nord&lt;/a&gt; Knight-Protector and commander of the Imperial occupation of House Redoran's district, commanded the Imperial Legion forces in the area from here. &lt;a href=\"Shardie\"&gt;Shardie&lt;/a&gt;, a &lt;a href=\"Redguards%20%28Morrowind%29\"&gt;Redguard&lt;/a&gt; Crusader who had mastered the skill of blocking, could also be found here, and trained Imperial recruits and legionaries at Fort Buckmoth.\nThe Imperial Legion protected the Redoran-controlled districts of Morrowind from Fort Buckmoth, and led the fight against injustice, banditry, and theft from here. Imperial Legion forces, under the command of Imsin the Dreamer, assaulted the caverns of Ilunibi searching for smugglers, but instead discovered a Sixth House Cult base. The survival of one of the Imperial legionaries allowed the Nerevarine to assault the &lt;a href=\"Ilunibi\"&gt;Ilunibi&lt;/a&gt; and wipe out the Sixth House cultists. Imperial Legion soldiers from Fort Buckmoth also arrested a citizen of Ald'ruhn for smuggling Dwemer artifacts, rescued a soldier from &lt;a href=\"Moonmoth%20Legion%20Fort\"&gt;Fort Moonmoth&lt;/a&gt; from &lt;a href=\"Ashurnibibi%20%28Morrowind%29\"&gt;Ashurnibibi&lt;/a&gt;, and defeated a rogue &lt;a href=\"House%20Telvanni%20%28Morrowind%29\"&gt;House Telvanni&lt;/a&gt; wizard in &lt;a href=\"Assumanu\"&gt;Assumanu&lt;/a&gt; and restored an embroidered gauntlet to a lady in Ald'ruhn.\nServices.\n&lt;a href=\"House%20Redoran%20%28Morrowind%29\"&gt;House Redoran&lt;/a&gt; services were in the Council House and Councilor's Manors of &lt;a href=\"Ald%27ruhn-under-Skar\"&gt;Ald'ruhn-under-Skar&lt;/a&gt;. The Ald'ruhn &lt;a href=\"Tribunal\"&gt;Tribunal&lt;/a&gt; Temple on the eastern side of the city provided services for Tribunal Temple worshippers and pilgrims. The Buckmoth Legion Fort offered services to the &lt;a href=\"Imperial%20Legion%20%28Morrowind%29\"&gt;Imperial Legion&lt;/a&gt; and devotees of the &lt;a href=\"Imperial%20Cult\"&gt;Imperial Cult&lt;/a&gt;, the official religious cult of the &lt;a href=\"Cyrodiil\"&gt;Cyrodiil&lt;/a&gt;ic Empires, including an Imperial cult altar dedicated to the worship of the &lt;a href=\"Nine%20Divines\"&gt;Nine Divines&lt;/a&gt;. The guildhalls of the &lt;a href=\"Fighters%20Guild%20%28Morrowind%29\"&gt;Fighters Guild&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Mages%20Guild%20%28Morrowind%29\"&gt;Mages Guild&lt;/a&gt; were located near the South Gate, and also provided many services to their members. Pricey, but high-quality clothier, alchemist, and enchanter shops could also be found in Ald'ruhn-under-Skar. Commodities at reasonable prices, but with smaller selections, were available from the smith, clothier, trader, pawnbroker, and bookseller in Ald'ruhn's upper district, surrounding the shell of the extinct emperor crab that housed Ald'ruhn-under-Skar.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Ald%20Skar%20Inn\"&gt;Ald Skar Inn&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Ald%27ruhn%20Council%20Club\"&gt;Council Club&lt;/a&gt; cornerclub were found in the western regions of Ald'ruhn, near the West Gate and the &lt;a href=\"Silt%20Strider%20%28Morrowind%29\"&gt;silt strider&lt;/a&gt; port. The Rat in the Pot cornerclub was found in the southern area of Ald'ruhn, near the guildhalls of the Mages Guild and Fighters Guild, and faced the guild square. The Tribunal Temple in Ald'ruhn, which was located in the northern section of Ald'ruhn, offered a wide range of services, though most were restricted to the higher members of the hierarchy of the Tribunal Temple. The Tribunal priests blessed parishioners and pilgrims to the temple for a small price, though pilgrims were allowed to pray at the shrines to &lt;a href=\"Vivec%20%28Morrowind%29\"&gt;Vivec&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Almalexia%20%28Tribunal%29\"&gt;Almalexia&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Sotha%20Sil%20%28Tribunal%29\"&gt;Sotha Sil&lt;/a&gt;, as well as the shrines to &lt;a href=\"Roris\"&gt;St. Roris&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"St.%20Meris\"&gt;St. Meris&lt;/a&gt;, free of charge.\nThe Ald Skar Inn, Council Club cornerclub, and Rat in the Pot cornerclub were well-stocked with local and foreign drinks to serve to their patrons. Rooms could also be rented for use by travelers at the Ald Skar Inn. The &lt;a href=\"Thieves%20Guild%20%28Morrowind%29\"&gt;Thieves Guild&lt;/a&gt; also provided services through their representatives and members who could be found in the local Thieves Guild hangout on the guild square, the Rat in the Pot cornerclub. The local Mages Guild could teleport people willing to pay the price to any other Mages Guild guildhall in Vvardenfell as well as sell useful spells and items to its members and prospective members.\nNotable characters.\nThe following is a list of notable, and high-profile people who resided in or around the &lt;a href=\"Great%20House\"&gt;Great House&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"House%20Redoran%20%28Morrowind%29\"&gt;Redoran&lt;/a&gt; district capital of Ald'ruhn during the &lt;a href=\"Vvardenfell%20Crisis\"&gt;Vvardenfell Crisis&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Oblivion%20Crisis\"&gt;Oblivion Crisis&lt;/a&gt;:\nTravel and transportation.\n&lt;a href=\"Imperial\"&gt;Imperial&lt;/a&gt;-constructed roads led northwest to the villages of &lt;a href=\"Maar%20Gan\"&gt;Maar Gan&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Gnisis%20%28Morrowind%29\"&gt;Gnisis&lt;/a&gt;, and by a circuitous western route to &lt;a href=\"Caldera%20%28Morrowind%29\"&gt;Caldera&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Balmora%20%28Morrowind%29\"&gt;Balmora&lt;/a&gt;, and other cities in the south of &lt;a href=\"Vvardenfell%20%28Morrowind%29\"&gt;Vvardenfell&lt;/a&gt;. The road to Balmora swung northwest to avoid passing through the barren wastes inhabited by the &lt;a href=\"Ashlanders%20%28Morrowind%29\"&gt;Ashlanders&lt;/a&gt;, and curved around towards the west until it headed south again towards Caldera. Between Ald'ruhn and Caldera were many side roads and paths. The &lt;a href=\"Imperial%20Legion%20%28Morrowind%29\"&gt;Imperial Legion&lt;/a&gt; planted fenceposts along the roads to help keep travelers and pilgrims from getting lost during their journeys. The silt strider port was located along the western town wall, north of the West Gate. The Silt Strider service went from Ald'ruhn to Balmora, Gnisis, &lt;a href=\"Khuul\"&gt;Khuul&lt;/a&gt;, and Maar Gan.\n&lt;a href=\"Mages%20Guild%20%28Morrowind%29\"&gt;Mages Guild&lt;/a&gt; guides at the local Ald'ruhn guildhall along guild square teleported travelers who did not want to travel long distances using the Imperial road system or the Silt Strider service to the Mages Guild guildhall in Balmora, &lt;a href=\"Vivec%20City%20%28Morrowind%29\"&gt;Vivec City&lt;/a&gt;, Caldera, and &lt;a href=\"Sadrith%20Mora%20%28Morrowind%29\"&gt;Sadrith Mora&lt;/a&gt; for a modest fee. &lt;a href=\"Gnaar%20Mok\"&gt;Gnaar Mok&lt;/a&gt; was a long and exceptionally unpleasant walk west to the coast and then south which was complicated by the fact that there were no roads, trails, or marked routes leading there from Ald'ruhn. Casual travelers ill-equipped for the attacks of wild beasts, brigands, bandits, and Ashlanders were warned by the Imperial Legion and the government of &lt;a href=\"Morrowind\"&gt;Morrowind&lt;/a&gt; that they should keep to the roads and travel services instead of attempting to eke their way through the wilderness in an attempt to discover a shortcut to their destination."}

As luck would have it, the young Chimer would be rescued by &lt;a href=\"Vivec\"&gt;Vivec&lt;/a&gt;, who would become his close-friend along with &lt;a href=\"Almalexia\"&gt;Almalexia&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Indoril%20Nerevar\"&gt;Indoril Nerevar&lt;/a&gt;. As time went on, Sotha Sil would attain godhood and become a member of the Tribunal, along with Vivec and Almalexia. He would establish the Clockwork City, a world incredibly advanced, filled with machines and factotums.\n&lt;a href=\"Second%20Era\"&gt;Second Era&lt;/a&gt;.\nDuring the &lt;a href=\"Interregnum\"&gt;Interregnum&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"2E%20583\"&gt;2E 583&lt;/a&gt;, Ald Sotha devolved into decaying ruins, abandoned after Mehrunes Dagon destroyed it. But with Sotha Sil's rise to power, the ruined settlement began to hold significance to the &lt;a href=\"Tribunal%20Temple\"&gt;Tribunal Temple&lt;/a&gt;, making it a stop for pilgrims. A Daedric Cult to Mehrunes Dagon established a statue of their lord at the lower levels of the ruins, where the Tribunal Pilgrims go to fulfill the tasks in the Pilgrimage of the Four Corners. &lt;a href=\"Daedra\"&gt;Daedra&lt;/a&gt; had begun to inhabit the area, including &lt;a href=\"Scamp\"&gt;Scamp&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"Clannfear\"&gt;Clannfear&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"Fiendroth\"&gt;Fiendroth&lt;/a&gt;s, and &lt;a href=\"Hunger\"&gt;Hunger&lt;/a&gt;s. But regardless, Ald Sotha was able to stand the test of time amidst the Interregnum and the construction of the nearby &lt;a href=\"Vivec%20City\"&gt;Vivec City&lt;/a&gt;.\n&lt;a href=\"Third%20Era\"&gt;Third Era&lt;/a&gt;.\nDuring the &lt;a href=\"Vvardenfell%20Crisis\"&gt;Vvardenfell Crisis&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"3E%20427\"&gt;3E 427&lt;/a&gt;, the ruins of Ald Sotha were reoccupied by the &lt;a href=\"Dark%20Brotherhood\"&gt;Dark Brotherhood&lt;/a&gt; of Vvardenfell, rivals of the &lt;a href=\"Morag%20Tong\"&gt;Morag Tong&lt;/a&gt;. The &lt;a href=\"Night%20Mother\"&gt;Night Mother&lt;/a&gt; of the Brotherhood, &lt;a href=\"Severa%20Magia\"&gt;Severa Magia&lt;/a&gt; came into possession of three items of &lt;a href=\"Sanguine\"&gt;Sanguine&lt;/a&gt;, each item was sought out by the Morag Tong, making her a target of the assassin group. &lt;a href=\"Eno%20Hlaalu\"&gt;Eno Hlaalu&lt;/a&gt; of the Morag Tong had sent an &lt;a href=\"Nerevarine\"&gt;assassin&lt;/a&gt; to the ruins of Ald Sotha, to assassinate Severa Magia honorably and to retrieve the Sanguine artifacts, although these tasks were separate. It is unknown what happened to the Dark Brotherhood afterward, but the Morag Tong continued to expand their influence all throughout Vvardenfell, and all of Sanguine's artifacts were obtained. It was also around this time, the &lt;a href=\"Shoes%20of%20St.%20Rilms%20%28Item%29\"&gt;Shoes of St. Rilms&lt;/a&gt; were located here, near the statue to Mehrunes Dagon."}

The room on the northeast-side contains one enemy, but little else of note.

I recognized the trinket at once as the sigil of the &lt;a href=\"Order%20of%20the%20Black%20Worm%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Cult of the Black Worm&lt;/a&gt;. While I considered this, I heard the dull thwack of a blunt object hitting flesh and bone, and my world went black.\nI awoke in a cave, bound to a chair, my head throbbing with bittersweet pain. A number of hooded cultists surrounded me, each with the unmistakable gleam of murder in his eyes. I quite liked them.\nOne of the cultists seemed different than the others, and I recognized him as their leader almost immediately. He had a cold, yet calm demeanor and seemed completely unafraid of me.\nHe introduced himself as &lt;a href=\"Abnur%20Tharn%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Abnur Tharn&lt;/a&gt;. He was somewhat displeased that I had made my evening meal on one of his most loyal guards. Normally, he explained, I would have been discorporated for such an infraction, but he said he liked my style and my \u2026 violent proclivities. He said he saw a lot of promise in me, and would like to propose a mutually beneficial arrangement.\nIf I agreed to join the Worm Cult, I could replace this agent. I would reside in a conveniently placed underground lair within the city limits, which would assure me a continued stream of meals, along with a virtually unlimited supply of &lt;a href=\"black%20soul%20gem\"&gt;black soul gem&lt;/a&gt;s.\nThe agreement did sound promising, but just to play &lt;a href=\"Daedra%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Daedra's&lt;/a&gt; advocate, I asked what my alternative might be. In answer, Tharn opened a portal to &lt;a href=\"Coldharbour%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Coldharbour&lt;/a&gt; right at my feet. My chair began to teeter, and the screams of the damned filled my ears. Lovely to listen to, but not something I wished to experience firsthand.\nNeedless to say, I chose servitude. Now, I while away my days guarding this wretched cavern while prowling the city streets after dusk. It's not a bad existence. In fact, I've even begun to take up the study of &lt;a href=\"necromancy\"&gt;necromancy&lt;/a&gt;. At some point, perhaps Tharn will consent to teaching me the finer points himself. Time will tell. And I have all the time in the world, don't I?"}

Her plan is to get herself captured and learn what the prisoners know while you search the forsworn camp for clues. She will give you a disguise so that you can explore the camp undisturbed. \nThe first piece of information you will find is a book in the east of camp, in the building with the smelter, &lt;a href=\"A%20Diet%20of%20Eyes\"&gt;A Diet of Eyes&lt;/a&gt;. it is a book about &lt;a href=\"Hagraven%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Hagravens&lt;/a&gt; and their diet; they eat human eyes. this building also contains another book that might interest you; the lorebook &lt;a href=\"Songs%20of%20the%20Return%2C%20Vol%2049\"&gt;Songs of the Return, Vol 49&lt;/a&gt;. Your next target is in the northern part of the camp, behind a building. There, you will find a cart full of corpses, all missing their eyes. Finally, head to the western part of the camp and you will find a hagraven totem. \n\"&lt;This cart is piled high with the bodies of dead miners. All the corpses are missing their eyes.&gt;\"\n\"&lt;This totem bears the distinctive markings of Hagraven worship.&gt;\"\nHead to the prisoner camp east of where you found the cart and speak with Tovisa about what you found.

Continue to follow my plan.\"\n\"Send more bodies as you finish with them. We need all you can supply.\"\n\"The Pact draws closer; remain strong. If we succeed, all these lands will belong to the Reach!\"\nThe key will be in a chest on the ground, but the moment you try taking it, Alona will see through your disguise and attack, so be careful. Once you have the key, head back outside and speak with prisoner &lt;a href=\"Gnarled-Root\"&gt;Gnarled-Root&lt;/a&gt;. She will tell you that the reachmen have taken Tovisa and the rest into the mine. Gnarled-Root can be intimidated to give you a ward against the hagravens. \nHead into the mine to the west and look for Tovisa. You will find her in the west of the central room. She has been blinded by the hagravens; you are too late. Speaking with her will finish the quest and start the next one, &lt;a href=\"Breaking%20the%20Coven\"&gt;Breaking the Coven&lt;/a&gt;."}

Asking him about why he is able to offer these special prices on scrolls reveals that he is not so inclined to give out details and seems offended that folks would just assume his offers were not legitimate.

The entrance is in the southeast corner of the district.\nOnce inside the sewers turn to the west and travel up a short slope to find Ahnia standing near a note on the ground. Attempting to read this note prior to speaking with her will cause her to attack. Speaking with her about 'Ten-Tongues' Weerhat prompts her to hostilities as well. Once she is dealt with, which may be a challenge since she's a level 30 &lt;a href=\"Assassin\"&gt;Assassin&lt;/a&gt;, take the note and return to 'Ten-Tongues'. The note reveals that Ahnia had given a book to 'Ten-Tongues' Weerhat which he was having a hard time selling due to being indecipherable. This is likely why there was such a discount. Return to the Pawnbroker.\nConfronting 'Ten-Tongues' with news of Ahnia's death causes him to admit to the whole fiasco and to hand over the stolen book. Attempting to read the book reveals little more than the name of author, &lt;a href=\"Elbert%20Nermarc\"&gt;Elbert Nermarc&lt;/a&gt;. He is an enchanter living in &lt;a href=\"Craftsmen%27s%20Hall\"&gt;Craftsmen's Hall&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Godsreach\"&gt;Godsreach&lt;/a&gt;. He can be found in his room upstairs.

I am glad you are not here for the onslaught. We are outnumbered, five undead to a man. I don't know how they got in! We swept the halls of this house of the dead, then we locked up. We were alone. Just myself, Pegasai, Jonis, and Luven. As soon as we saw the first wave, it appeared from behind! I have no idea how they were able to surprise us. It's as if they were appearing out of nowhere. Summoned to this position somehow. We fought long and hard, until we could barely hold our weapons up anymore. &lt;a href=\"Jonis\"&gt;Jonis&lt;/a&gt; was the first one to get cut down. Brother, our longtime friend Jonis, died in front of me in the most horrible way. But do know, he died with the honor of a fighting man. This battle will not be won. Pegasai urged me deeper into the tomb. I saw not Luven, but heard his dying scream come from somewhere within the tomb. I am taking refuge in this main burial chamber. I am here with our due payment from &lt;a href=\"Goris%20the%20Maggot%20King\"&gt;Goris&lt;/a&gt;. He will not get it from my living hands. I will hold up until &lt;a href=\"Pegasai\"&gt;Pegasai&lt;/a&gt; comes for me, or until those cursed &lt;a href=\"Bonewalker%20%28Morrowind%29\"&gt;bonewalkers&lt;/a&gt; come to finish me off.\nWe committed ourselves to aiding Goris in a task, putting our butts on the line, and he promised payment. I'll be damned if he is going to take it back! Brother, if you make it here and find nothing more than my corpse, I hope you can make some sense out of my final letter to you. Avenge your Brother, and your trusting colleagues so that our souls may lay in peace. Goris can be found in a tomb in &lt;a href=\"Tel%20Mora%20%28Morrowind%29\"&gt;Tel Mora&lt;/a&gt;. We loot and hideout in the occasional tomb, but that sick fool lives in a tomb with his deader companions. Without his knowledge, I forged a key that fits his tomb entry. Use it to gain entry to his lair. Goris should not, and cannot, get the last action. He betrayed us and used us. Avenge my Brother. Avenge!\nLive long and may you always be in good health,\n&lt;a href=\"Tyronius\"&gt;Tyronius&lt;/a&gt;"}

These items typically have an enchant value of 50 or 100. &lt;a href=\"Honorable%20Writ%20of%20Execution\"&gt;Writs of execution&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Books%20%28Morrowind%29\"&gt;books&lt;/a&gt;, and items that are already enchanted cannot be used for this purpose.\nInscriptions.\nEvery scroll in \"Morrowind\" has an inscription written in the &lt;a href=\"Daedric%20alphabet\"&gt;Daedric alphabet&lt;/a&gt; that can be displayed by selecting the item in the &lt;a href=\"Nerevarine\"&gt;Nerevarine&lt;/a&gt;'s inventory. Most of the English translations appear written in caps in the game's \".\"\nSome scroll inscriptions are unique, for instance, the Scroll of the Ninth Barrier's inscription reads, \"The ninth barrier cannot exist!\" (In reference to the fact that the barrier scrolls apparently end at six; there are no seventh or eighth barrier scrolls, making a ninth barrier unlikely.) Many inscriptions are generic and repeated for multiple scrolls, most notably \"Woe upon you.\" The text from a &lt;a href=\"Morag%20Tong%20%28Morrowind%29\"&gt;Morag Tong&lt;/a&gt; Honorable Writ of Execution is inexplicably used as the inscription for a scroll.\nA &lt;a href=\"%23List%20of%20inscriptions\"&gt;list of inscriptions&lt;/a&gt; is provided below.\nWeight.\nScrolls have a weight of 0.20, other than five exceptions that weigh 1.00:\nList of scrolls.\nThe following is a list of all the scrolls available in \"Morrowind\" and the expansion packs:\nList of inscriptions.\nThe following is a list of the &lt;a href=\"Scrolls_%28Morrowind%29%23Inscriptions\"&gt;inscriptions&lt;/a&gt; written on \"Morrowind\" scrolls:"}

{"id": "859965", "revid": "5064773", "url": "https://elderscrolls.fandom.com/wiki?curid=859965", "title": "Tel Var Stones", "text": "Tel Var Stones are a currency used in . They can be used as currency for legendary items at the sewer alliance bases.\nBackground.\nTel Var stones are parts of the &lt;a href=\"White-Gold%20Tower%20%28Online%29\"&gt;White-Gold Tower&lt;/a&gt;, and were created by the &lt;a href=\"Ayleid\"&gt;Ayleid&lt;/a&gt;s during their construction of the tower. During the time of the &lt;a href=\"Planemeld\"&gt;Planemeld&lt;/a&gt;, the power of the stones was discovered. Scholars could sense the power within the stones, and some wanted to use them against the Daedric invasion as a weapon. According to this idea, the magical knowledge of the Ayleids, and the construction methods of the White-Gold Tower could be uncovered by using the stones for research. Others state that the Tel Var Stones are the Ayleid's version of a &lt;a href=\"Zero%20Stone\"&gt;Zero Stone&lt;/a&gt;, as they could not create their own Zero Stone, they settled for Tel Var. According to this idea, if the Tel Var Stones were weakened enough, the &lt;a href=\"Mundus\"&gt;Mundus&lt;/a&gt; would cease to exist. The people who believe in this idea wanted the Tel Var Stones to be collected and kept until after the Planemeld was over, to then use them to repair the damages dealt to the Imperial City.\nResearch on the Tel Var Stones.\nThe Imperial Academy of Alchemists followed experiments on the stones.\nBy putting a quantity of Tel Var Stones in a mortar and pestle and grinding it, the first part of the experiment took place. Following which, filtered water was added to the mixture, and was set in an alembic of expert and scholarly make, as this would seperate the vapor of the Stone. The next step was to let the liquid Tel Var mixture drip into a calcinator of inferior quality, as the natural vugginess of the ramekin made from simple materials would prevent the entire mixture from turning to ash. Then an iron ladle was to be used to stir and clear the mixture, gathering together whitish curds which swum at the top.\nAfter the water ceased to be clear, and obtained a glow, an auripigmentum powder, equivalent to the initial quantity of the Tel Var Stone powder, was to be added, alongside realgar in somewhat equal proportions as would lie upon half a Dwemer coin piece of eighteen or twenty pebble weight. After both ingredients had wed, a capsule of powdered crimson nirnroot was to be added, following which the powder would flash and glow. After the powder ceased to glow, the curds in the mixture were to be removed with a ladle, having a lip or notch in the brim for regimented measurement. Half of the mixture would then be released into a master alchemist retort, following which a few small drops of what remained of the remaining liquid were to be extracted and be added to a phial of purified water. If the drops were round and tailless, it meant not enough Tel Var was present in the drop, in which case, the magicke within was lost.\nThe mixture itself, was a warm paste, and provided pure light from each granular crystal within, which suggested connections to both the &lt;a href=\"Illusion\"&gt;Illusion&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Restoration\"&gt;Restoration&lt;/a&gt; schools of magic. Were the water filtered from the thick suspension, the nature of its power could be seen by placing Orichalcum on its surface. The mineral would appear to levitate, which suggested a connection to the &lt;a href=\"Alteration\"&gt;Alteration&lt;/a&gt; school of magic. Upon close examination, the water would appear to consist of white crystals, which would often clump together in clots which vibrated the same way conjuring stones do. If the mixture were to be combined with another alchemical ingredient, it could cause slowness and weakness to all elements, suggesting connections to the &lt;a href=\"Destruction\"&gt;Destruction&lt;/a&gt; school of magic. If the Tel Var vapor removed from the alembic in the preceding recipe is hit with a destruction spell, the vapor will reflect the spell, suggesting a connection to the mysticism school of magic.\nFollowing the research, several conclusions were made. The first is that the Tel Var Stones held many unique applications to magic. The second was that, physically, the stones show magical radiance, a sign that the stones were somehow imbued with more magical power than any other similar object that had been studied prior.\nAcquisition.\nTel Var Stones can be acquired through multiple means:\nMultipliers.\nHaving a certain amount of stones will cause the stone multiplier to go up. With a multiplier, stones obtained from killing creatures will be multiplied. The more stones you have, the higher the multiplier. However, with more stones in the inventory, there is more risk of losing them when being killed by a creature, and especially an enemy player.\nWith 5 pieces of &lt;a href=\"Imperial%20Physique\"&gt;Imperial Physique&lt;/a&gt; worn, the 4x multiplier also grants a large bonus to &lt;a href=\"Health%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Health&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Magicka%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Magicka&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Stamina%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Stamina&lt;/a&gt; (base 1032 increased by 600%). However, this also causes the player to glow, making them quite noticeable to other players and signaling they have a large amount of Tel Var."}

Very well\". One day, they cleared out a ruined fort near &lt;a href=\"Whiterun%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Whiterun&lt;/a&gt; and when they got outside, they saw a bandit galloping away on horseback. Teldryn continues on to say that they tracked and chased the bandit for three days, eventually arriving at what Teldryn called the \"largest bandit encampment I'd ever seen.\" He says his Nord boss took one look at Teldryn and had the most menacing grin he had ever seen.

If kept at range, he is capable of dual-casting to improve the damage of his spells. Furthermore, he may also utilize a ward spell if he becomes targeted by more than one enemy. If he loses a significant portion of his health, he may cast &lt;a href=\"Fast%20Healing\"&gt;Fast Healing&lt;/a&gt; to sustain himself.\nIn close combat, Teldryn will begin using the &lt;a href=\"Flames%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Flames&lt;/a&gt; spell interspersed with power attacks.

One of them would be to kill members of the &lt;a href=\"Veiled%20Heritance\"&gt;Veiled Heritance&lt;/a&gt; stationed in the path leading up to the mansion, and looting their bodies for the key to the entrance. For those that wish to avoid conflict, the second way of finding from the hidden entrance would be best. The entrance is located behind the manor, on the beach. The beach is patrolled by Veiled Heritance members, however, it is easier to sneak by them.\nAfter finding your way into the Manor, you must locate Teldur. He will be hidden behind a screen decoration, directly opposite to the main entrance. He explains that Cannonreeve betrayed them, dying shortly after.\n\"The Canonreeve ... betrayed us. Betrayed us all ...\"\nAfter talking to Teldur, head up the stairs in the manor. Canonreeve Valano can be found on the upper floor, along with four other Veiled Heritance members. Since the Auridon Marine will also fight alongside the Vestige, the fight with Valano can be considered relatively easier.\nAfter killing him, the Vestige must report back to Elenwen. She will be waiting in front of the main entrance inside the manor along with two Auridon Marines. After telling her that Teldur was not the traitor as she initially thought, but the Cannonreeve, her father, she is in disbelief.\n\"Your valiant rescue of the First Auridon Marines was well-timed.

Note that using Telekinesis to manipulate owned items will be considered theft unless the player is undetected.\nOther uses include:\nControlling the Telekinesis spell.\nTo use the spell, is must actually be 'cast' twice: once to activate the ability, and once more on the intended target. The first cast puts the player in \"grab mode.\" While looking around, names of grabbable items will appear in the lower right-hand corner of the screen as they would when targeting them normally, except from a greater range. Any item outside the default Grab range but within Telekinesis' range will appear in orange text, indicating that they can be manipulated. Casting Telekinesis a second time while targeting one of these items will \"grab\" it. Successfully grabbed items are indicated with a faint glow.\nAt this point, the grabbed item will behave like any item manipulated using the default Grab function, but at longer range. It can be moved for the duration of the spell by moving the mouse or joystick (no further button presses or holding down of buttons is required). It will float (if raised off the ground or other surface) at a fixed distance. If the item is on the ground, it can be dragged or rolled.\nOnce an item has been \"grabbed\", the following options are available for manipulating the object:\nOnce the spell duration has expired, floating items will drop to the ground. Items in motion will continue in motion using standard game physics.\nNote that the player will generally remain in \"grab mode\" (item names still appear in orange text) after the first item manipulation.\nTips, exploits and bugs.\nUsing Telekinesis for decoration.\nBecause of its longer range and push/pull functions, Telekinesis is often more helpful than the default Grab in manipulating and placing objects for decoration, such as in the player's house.\nTelekinesis 'magicka recharge' exploit.\nBecause Telekinesis is a target-based spell, but it affects \"self\" (meaning, it first applies a \"Telekinesis\" effect to the player, then is cast at an object), a &lt;a href=\"Spell%20Absorption%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;Spell Absorption&lt;/a&gt; effect will absorb the player's own spell, restoring their &lt;a href=\"Magicka%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;Magicka&lt;/a&gt;. Because the amount of Magicka absorbed is determined by the original cost of the spell, but the \"actual\" cost is reduced by the player's Mysticism skill, more Magicka will be absorbed than is spent casting the spell.\nFor example, the spell &lt;a href=\"Remote%20Manipulation\"&gt;Remote Manipulation&lt;/a&gt; has a base cost of 28 magicka. With high Mysticism, the casting cost can be reduced to 5. This will result in a net gain of 23 Magicka when cast with spell absorption. Note that Magicka cannot be restored to full using this method; it will cap at (Max Magicka - casting cost). For example, a character with 450 Magicka using Remote Manipulation at a casting cost of 5 would only be able to restore themselves to 445 Magicka (450 Max - 5 casting cost=445). This means that a high-cost spell may restore Magicka faster, but a low-cost spell will restore it closer to its max value.\nThis exploit is especially useful to characters that have chosen &lt;a href=\"The%20Atronach\"&gt;The Atronach&lt;/a&gt; as their birthsign, as they will be able to regenerate their Magicka even faster than other characters, and no longer require enemies to do it."}

If the Nerevarine is male, obtaining her vote will require her disposition towards the Nerevarine to be above 80, this can be done by bribing her. Then the choice to \"Hurl yourself at her feet and plead for a hearing\" will become available. She will then listen to the Hero's tale and grant her vote, as well as offering a single &lt;a href=\"Summon%20Golden%20Saint%20%28Morrowind%29\"&gt;Summon Golden Saint scroll&lt;/a&gt;.\nIf the Nerevarine is female, Dratha will grant her vote with little to no trouble and will award four &lt;a href=\"Summon%20Golden%20Saint%20%28Morrowind%29\"&gt;Summon Golden Saint scrolls&lt;/a&gt;.\nMaster Neloth.\nThe vote of &lt;a href=\"Neloth%20%28Morrowind%29\"&gt;Master Neloth&lt;/a&gt; requires the Nerevarine to levitate to his chambers in &lt;a href=\"Tel%20Naga%20%28Morrowind%29\"&gt;Tel Naga&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Sadrith%20Mora%20%28Morrowind%29\"&gt;Sadrith Mora&lt;/a&gt;. Once there, Neloth will grant his vote to the Nerevarine if his disposition is above 70, which can be achieved by &lt;a href=\"Bribery\"&gt;bribing&lt;/a&gt; him.\nMistress Therana.\nTherana, who was described by Master Aryon as losing her mind, can be found in the Upper Tower of &lt;a href=\"Tel%20Branora%20%28Morrowind%29\"&gt;Tel Branora&lt;/a&gt;. To gain her vote, the Nerevarine must interrupt her unending tale by either amusing her (if the Hero has a &lt;a href=\"Speechcraft%20%28Morrowind%29\"&gt;speechcraft&lt;/a&gt; skill above 30) or by telling her the Hero's story. This is only successful if her disposition is above 80, which can be achieved by bribery.\u00a0\nMaster Baladas (Telvanni members only).\nObtaining the vote of &lt;a href=\"Master%20Baladas\"&gt;Master Baladas&lt;/a&gt; is only required if the Nerevarine has joined the House of Telvanni and completed the quest \"&lt;a href=\"Baladas%20Demnevanni%20%28Quest%29\"&gt;Baladas Demnevanni&lt;/a&gt;.\" He can be found in &lt;a href=\"Gnisis%20%28Morrowind%29\"&gt;Gnisis&lt;/a&gt; and will grant his vote if his disposition towards the Nerevarine is above 40.\nGothren.\n&lt;a href=\"Archmagister%20Gothren\"&gt;Archmagister Gothren&lt;/a&gt; is located in &lt;a href=\"Tel%20Aruhn%20%28Morrowind%29\"&gt;Tel Aruhn&lt;/a&gt; and as Master Aryon explained, will prevent the Nerevarine from gaining his vote by constantly delaying his decision or, if his disposition is above 90, will simply refuse. The only alternative, therefore, is to defeat him in a battle. Gothren is flanked by two &lt;a href=\"Dremora%20%28Morrowind%29\"&gt;Dremora&lt;/a&gt; who can be attacked first without placing a &lt;a href=\"Crime%20%28Morrowind%29\"&gt;bounty&lt;/a&gt; on the Nerevarine. This step will be skipped if the Nerevarine is already the Telvanni Archmagister since Gothren will already be dead.\nOnce all the votes have been acquired, the Nerevarine must return to Aryon to be granted the title of Hortator of Telvanni and receive the &lt;a href=\"Robe%20of%20the%20Hortator\"&gt;Robe of the Hortator&lt;/a&gt; as a token of the position."}

The Peninsula is the territory of the &lt;a href=\"Dunmer%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Dunmer&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"House%20Telvanni%20%28Online%29\"&gt;House Telvanni&lt;/a&gt;, which, despite being in &lt;a href=\"Morrowind%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Morrowind&lt;/a&gt;, is not a part of the &lt;a href=\"Ebonheart%20Pact\"&gt;Ebonheart Pact&lt;/a&gt;. It sits on the central east coast of Morrowind against the &lt;a href=\"Padomaic%20Ocean\"&gt;Padomaic Ocean&lt;/a&gt; with &lt;a href=\"Bal%20Foyen\"&gt;Bal Foyen&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Stonefalls%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Stonefalls&lt;/a&gt; to the east, &lt;a href=\"Deshaan%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Deshaan&lt;/a&gt; to the southeast, and &lt;a href=\"Vvardenfell%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Vvardenfell&lt;/a&gt; is to its northwest across the &lt;a href=\"Inner%20Sea\"&gt;Inner Sea&lt;/a&gt;. The city of &lt;a href=\"Necrom%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Necrom&lt;/a&gt; is the region's major metropolitan area on the northeast coast and there are several smaller settlements and Telvanni &lt;a href=\"House%20Telvanni%23Mushroom%20towers\"&gt;mushroom towers&lt;/a&gt; across the landscape.\nBackground.\nThe Telvanni Peninsula is governed by the magisters of House Telvanni. Despite being one of the Dunmer &lt;a href=\"Great%20Houses\"&gt;Great Houses&lt;/a&gt;, they refused to join the Ebonheart Pact at its founding, instead deciding to expel every trooper of the other houses from the Peninsula. By &lt;a href=\"2E%20582\"&gt;2E 582&lt;/a&gt;, the coast from Bal Foyen to Necrom on both sides was under the complete authority of the Telvanni, as well as the lands further north and the &lt;a href=\"Northeast%20Archipelago\"&gt;Northeast Archipelago&lt;/a&gt;, with the notable exception of Necrom itself. During the formation of the Ebonheart Pact, barristers from both the Pact and Telvanni met to discuss the status of the city given its cultural and religious significance to all Dunmer beyond just Telvanni. It was decided to allow Necrom to have nominal independence from House Telvanni under the administration of the &lt;a href=\"Keepers%20of%20the%20Dead\"&gt;Keepers of the Dead&lt;/a&gt;, a holy order supported by the &lt;a href=\"Tribunal%20Temple\"&gt;Tribunal Temple&lt;/a&gt;. As such, House Telvanni guarantees safe passage to those traveling to and from Necrom. The island of Gorne off the northeast coast of the Peninsula is also not owned by House Telvanni, instead being used by &lt;a href=\"House%20Indoril%20%28Online%29\"&gt;House Indoril&lt;/a&gt; as an asylum for insane mages. House Telvanni's control over the Peninsula is said to be absolute and its rule within its borders undisputed.\nThe settlement of &lt;a href=\"Ald%20Isra\"&gt;Ald Isra&lt;/a&gt; on the west coast provides a location for the Assembly of Mouths to convene, where the mouths of Telvanni magisters meet and represent their masters. For severe and consequential matters, a conclave of the magisters may be held wherein the magisters themselves are compelled to attend at &lt;a href=\"Tel%20Hluulen\"&gt;Tel Hluulen&lt;/a&gt; in Ald Isra. Several other mushroom towers also occupy the landscape. On the northwest coast of the Peninsula lies the &lt;a href=\"Dwemer%20Ruins%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Dwemer ruins&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"Kemel-Ze%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Kemel-Ze&lt;/a&gt;. In the &lt;a href=\"First%20Era\"&gt;First Era&lt;/a&gt; before the &lt;a href=\"Battle%20of%20Red%20Mountain\"&gt;Battle of Red Mountain&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"disappearance%20of%20the%20Dwarves\"&gt;disappearance of the Dwarves&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Dumac%20Dwarfking\"&gt;Dumac Dwarfking&lt;/a&gt; gifted &lt;a href=\"Sotha%20Sil%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Sotha Sil&lt;/a&gt; a wing of Kemel-Ze to use as a laboratory following the brokering of an alliance with &lt;a href=\"Indoril%20Nerevar\"&gt;Indoril Nerevar&lt;/a&gt;. Although he no longer uses the laboratory, the &lt;a href=\"Factotum%20%28Online%29\"&gt;factotum&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Protus\"&gt;Protus&lt;/a&gt; continues to administer to the facility and ensure its security from Telvanni mages wishing to learn its secrets.\nLocations.\nThe following are locations accessible in the Telvanni Peninsula and, with the exception of &lt;a href=\"Unmarked%20Locations%20%28Online%29\"&gt;unmarked locations&lt;/a&gt;, are discoverable on the map. Points of Interest serve as locations with unique side quests, while &lt;a href=\"Cities%20%28Online%29\"&gt;cities&lt;/a&gt; serve as the centralized areas with multiple sublocations and act as a hub for services and &lt;a href=\"Merchants%20%28Online%29\"&gt;merchants&lt;/a&gt;. Explanations of the types of locations are provided in the &lt;a href=\"Locations%20%28Online%29%23Types\"&gt;main locations page&lt;/a&gt;.\nQuests.\nThe Telvanni Peninsula features a series of zone story quests and unrelated side quests. The zone story quests make up the core of the &lt;a href=\"Shadow%20Over%20Morrowind\"&gt;Shadow Over Morrowind&lt;/a&gt; story. Side quests are non-sequential and can be completed in any order, except where one carries on from another, and &lt;a href=\"repeatable%20quests\"&gt;repeatable quests&lt;/a&gt; can be completed multiple times: weekly for arenas and trials and daily for all others. Note that the zone quest for the Telvanni Peninsula is shared with Apocrypha.\nItem Sets.\nItem sets are related armor and weapons that, when worn together, provide unique benefits. Overland sets can be acquired from world bosses, world events, delves, public dungeons and containers and as quest rewards; dungeon sets can be acquired from within group dungeons; monster sets can be acquired from the final boss of veteran group dungeons and Undaunted Enclaves; and crafted sets can be created at specific locations across the zone.\nSkyshards.\nSeven Skyshards can be found in the Telvanni Peninsula totaling in two &lt;a href=\"skill%20points\"&gt;skill points&lt;/a&gt; and one left over. The rest of the Skyshards shown in the zone guide can be found in Apocrypha. The zone guide provides clues as to the location of each Skyshard, but many can be found simply by exploring and watching for the distinctive pillar of light they emit. Skyshards will appear on the map and compass when the Vestige is close to one and will remain discovered on the map even if it was not collected. Note that the number of the Skyshard is preserved according to its order in the &lt;a href=\"Necrom%20Skyshard%20Hunter\"&gt;Necrom Skyshard Hunter&lt;/a&gt; achievement.\nAchievements.\nAchievements can be earned by completing specific tasks such as completing quests and discovering locations. Achievements are separated into categories and their progress is viewable from the journal. Earning achievement provides the Vestige a number of points, and some achievements unlock unique rewards such as &lt;a href=\"Furnishings%20%28Online%29\"&gt;furnishings&lt;/a&gt; that can be bought from Achievement Furnishers or &lt;a href=\"collectibles\"&gt;collectibles&lt;/a&gt;.\nShalidor's Library.\nTen books that are a part of Shalidor's Library can be found in the Telvanni Peninsula and added to the collection. Books that have already been found in other zones will already be marked as completed in the zone tracker.\nFish.\nFish can be caught from fishing hotspots, ideally with the correct &lt;a href=\"bait\"&gt;bait&lt;/a&gt;. Common fish will be caught most often while rare fish and alternative bait are rare catches. Each zone has unique rare fish than can be caught from hotspots. &lt;a href=\"Slaughterfish%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Slaughterfish&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"trodh\"&gt;trodh&lt;/a&gt; can be caught from foul hotspots, &lt;a href=\"dhufish\"&gt;dhufish&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"longfin\"&gt;longfin&lt;/a&gt; can be caught from saltwater hotspots, &lt;a href=\"silverside%20perch\"&gt;silverside perch&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"spadetail\"&gt;spadetail&lt;/a&gt; can be caught from lake hotspots, and &lt;a href=\"Salmon%20%28Online%29\"&gt;salmon&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"River%20Betty%20%28Online%29\"&gt;river betty&lt;/a&gt; can be caught from river hotspots. &lt;a href=\"Chub\"&gt;Chub&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"minnow\"&gt;minnow&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"shad\"&gt;shad&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"fish%20roe\"&gt;fish roe&lt;/a&gt; can be caught and used as bait from foul, saltwater, lake and river hotspots, respectively.\nTrivia.\nThe text surrounding the map of the Telvanni Peninsula when viewing the map of Apocrypha reads \"Telvanni lands cradle of the ancient dead\" in the &lt;a href=\"Daedric%20alphabet\"&gt;Daedric alphabet&lt;/a&gt;: ."}

In order to do this, they must first speak to &lt;a href=\"Llunela%20Hleran\"&gt;Llunela Hleran&lt;/a&gt; in the Hermitage in the basement of the &lt;a href=\"Telvanni%20Council%20House\"&gt;Council House&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Sadrith%20Mora%20%28Morrowind%29\"&gt;Sadrith Mora&lt;/a&gt;.\nPhase I.\nThe Nerevarine may begin Phase I by obtaining a \"&lt;a href=\"Construction%20Contract\"&gt;Construction Contract&lt;/a&gt;\" from &lt;a href=\"Duke%20Vedam%20Dren%20%28Morrowind%29\"&gt;Duke Vedam Dren&lt;/a&gt;. Duke Dren will ask that the Nerevarine act in the best interests of &lt;a href=\"Morrowind\"&gt;Morrowind&lt;/a&gt; before giving them the contract (if the Nerevarine has already completed the &lt;a href=\"Main%20Quest%20%28Morrowind%29\"&gt;main quest&lt;/a&gt;, he will give the contract over as thanks). The Nerevarine will have also been told by Hleran to obtain a pair of &lt;a href=\"Soul%20Gem%20%28Morrowind%29\"&gt;strong souls&lt;/a&gt;, which can be obtained by killing &lt;a href=\"Golden%20Saint%20%28Morrowind%29\"&gt;Golden Saints&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Storm%20Atronach%20%28Morrowind%29\"&gt;Storm Atronachs&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"Winged%20Twilight%20%28Morrowind%29\"&gt;Winged Twilights&lt;/a&gt;. Once all objects have been obtained, the Nerevarine may return to Hleran, whom will order the first Phase to begin.\nAfter five days, Hlaren will be ready for the next phase. She will ask that the Nerevarine head to the site of construction, &lt;a href=\"Uvirith%27s%20Grave\"&gt;Uvirith's Grave&lt;/a&gt; (in the &lt;a href=\"Molag%20Amur%20%28Morrowind%29\"&gt;Molag Amur&lt;/a&gt; region, northwest of the &lt;a href=\"Erabenimsun%20Camp%20%28Morrowind%29\"&gt;Erabenimsun Camp&lt;/a&gt;). The foreman, Gashnakh gra-Moghul, will tell the Nerevarine that the construction is going well. They must then relay this information to Hlaren in Sadrith Mora. After five days, the Nerevarine will receive a journal update, informing them that the first phase has been completed.\nPhase II.\nThe second phase will begin once the Nerevarine has obtained two more things for Hleran. The first is 5,000, paid to her directly while the second is a set of Dwemer Plans, held within the ruins of &lt;a href=\"Mzanchend%20%28Morrowind%29\"&gt;Mzanchend&lt;/a&gt;\u00a0which are northwest of Tel Uvirith. Once the money and the plans have been handed to Hleran, the second phase will begin. The Nerevarine will receive a note of its completion five days later.\nPhase III.\nThe third phase of Tel Uvirith will only be available to the Nerevarine once they have ascended to the rank of Master in House Telvanni. Hleran will inform the Nerevarine that they will need guards in order to protect the stronghold. Helpfully she has a solution to this problem, however the key to this solution is the book \"&lt;a href=\"Secrets%20of%20Dwemer%20Animunculi\"&gt;Secrets of Dwemer Animunculi&lt;/a&gt;\" which is within the &lt;a href=\"Vampire%20%28Morrowind%29\"&gt;vampire&lt;/a&gt; cave of &lt;a href=\"Galom%20Daeus%20%28Morrowind%29\"&gt;Galom Daeus&lt;/a&gt; to the southwest of Tel Uvirith.\nThe Nerevarine must take the book to Hleran, whom will order the final phase of construction and the construction of the Stronghold's guards. After five days, the Nerevarine will receive a note of the completion of Tel Uvirith."}

My scouts estimated their force is small, not a full-scale invasion fleet, but the coast of &lt;a href=\"Malabal%20Tor\"&gt;Malabal Tor&lt;/a&gt; will be entirely at their mercy when they decide to attack.\nHad the Canonreeves taken just a moment from their maps tracking the movements of Orcs and Men, they'd see that a dire threat was growing under their noses. Every week my scouts reported an increase in Maormer strength, a few ships every few days, appearing under the cover of some kind of weather magic. Months too late, the Canonreeves agree with me, now.\nI know we ask much from you and your soldiers, but if you don't stop them, Alduril, the &lt;a href=\"Aldmeri%20Dominion%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Dominion&lt;/a&gt; will have yet another front to fight in this war.

By this time, some rumors have been spreading in the &lt;a href=\"Septim%20Empire\"&gt;Empire&lt;/a&gt; about the actions of the Eternal Champion's efforts.\nCorinth.\nAsking citizens about the Halls of Colossus will eventually direct the Eternal Champion to the &lt;a href=\"Mages%20Guild%20%28Arena%29\"&gt;Mages Guild&lt;/a&gt; in the city of &lt;a href=\"Corinth\"&gt;Corinth&lt;/a&gt;, in the province of &lt;a href=\"Elsweyr%20%28Arena%29\"&gt;Elsweyr&lt;/a&gt;. Upon entering the Guild and talking to the Mage, he will present himself as Loremaster Turamane ap'Kolthis. Already knowing of Eternal Champion's search for Halls of Colossus, he will make a proposal: a group of warrior-priests led by Sir Galandir from the &lt;a href=\"Temple%20of%20Agamanus%20%28Location%29\"&gt;Temple of Agamanus&lt;/a&gt; recently attacked the guild and stole a sacred tablet which can decipher a part of the &lt;a href=\"Elder%20Scroll\"&gt;Elder Scroll&lt;/a&gt;s. In exchange for recovering the tablet from the Temple, the Loremaster will give the location of the Halls of Colossus to the Eternal Champion.\nTemple of Agamanus.\nThe Temple of Agamanus will be marked on the map after the deal is accepted; it is located south of Corinth. Three levels compose the Temple, and while not having particularly complex corridors, these three areas are inhabited by &lt;a href=\"Ghost%20%28Arena%29\"&gt;Ghosts&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Skeleton%20%28Arena%29\"&gt;Skeletons&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Wraith%20%28Arena%29\"&gt;Wraiths&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Spider%20%28Arena%29\"&gt;Spiders&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Hell%20Hound\"&gt;Hell Hound&lt;/a&gt;s.\nUpon entering the Fortress, some Knights will attack. The door to the Second Level is located on the extreme southwest of the room, and Spiders and Hell Hounds guard the passage. It is possible to use the map (\"on the right\") to locate hidden doors and use a faster way to reach the door.\nIn the Second Level the door to the Third Level is located north of the room. The way there is lengthy, however, the spell &lt;a href=\"Passwall%20%28Arena%29\"&gt;Passwall&lt;/a&gt; can be greatly useful in this area. Without a map, the Second Level can be confusing and much more dangerous. The map (on the right) shows the correct way to reach the door.\nThe Third Level is the most dangerous and complex from the three areas and the Eternal Champion will need to swim on two occasions to reach the tablet, with the exception of again using Passwall to break the way to the artifact. In this level, more dangerous enemies will be guarding the way\u2014Skeletons and Wraiths. The area where the tablet remains cannot be reached using Passwall, for its walls are unbreakable. The confrontation with Wraiths is unavoidable in order to obtain the tablet.\nThe password to the door is \"sun.\" Once the tablet is taken, make the way back to Corinth and give it back to Turamane. Fulfilling its part of the deal, the Loremaster will inscribe the location of the Halls of Colossus on the map\u2014south of Elsweyr, in the coastline.\nBefore traveling to the Halls of Colossus, some observations must be taken:"}

Members of the Cult stay here with the Ancestor Moths in reclusion.\nDescription.\nGeography.\nThe Temple is located in the highest alps of the Jerall Mountains, within the Cyrodiil side, just before the &lt;a href=\"Skyrim\"&gt;Skyrim&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Morrowind\"&gt;Morrowind&lt;/a&gt; border. The Temple is meant to be secluded; it is a monastery with merely two buildings, a lodge for the &lt;a href=\"Moth%20Priests\"&gt;Moth Priests&lt;/a&gt; and the cathedral where they worship the Elder Scrolls. The area is sparsely wooded, considering that the area is high in the Jeralls. The Cult, and by extension, the temple, was named after &lt;a href=\"Ancestor%20Moth\"&gt;Ancestor Moth&lt;/a&gt;s, creatures that live in the area, whose silk is used to make &lt;a href=\"Nibenese\"&gt;Nibenese&lt;/a&gt;-style cloth that the priests normally wear. The &lt;a href=\"Ancestor%20Silk\"&gt;Ancestor Silk&lt;/a&gt; is a powerful substance that creates the strongest &lt;a href=\"Light%20Armor\"&gt;Light Armor&lt;/a&gt;.\nHistory.\n&lt;a href=\"Second%20Era\"&gt;Second Era&lt;/a&gt;.\nDuring the &lt;a href=\"Interregnum\"&gt;Interregnum&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"2E%20582\"&gt;2E 582&lt;/a&gt;, the Temple was administrated by &lt;a href=\"Crassius%20Viria\"&gt;Crassius Viria&lt;/a&gt; and what was left of the cult in the outbreak of the &lt;a href=\"Alliance%20War\"&gt;Alliance War&lt;/a&gt;, which ravaged the province of Cyrodiil. The Elder Scrolls stored within the Temple were stolen by warriors of the respective alliances, taking to their footholds in the province, such as the &lt;a href=\"Elder%20Scroll%20of%20Alma%20Ruma\"&gt;Alma Ruma&lt;/a&gt; taking by the &lt;a href=\"Daggerfall%20Covenant\"&gt;Daggerfall Covenant&lt;/a&gt;, and the &lt;a href=\"Elder%20Scroll%20of%20Ghartok\"&gt;Ghartok&lt;/a&gt; taking by the &lt;a href=\"Ebonheart%20Pact\"&gt;Ebonheart Pact&lt;/a&gt;. The Temple was situated in what was considered Pact Territory, rather close to their northern stronghold. The Cult was defenseless, only able to watch as their Scrolls were being taken back forward by the warring alliances. An Elder Scroll was taken to the &lt;a href=\"Imperial%20City\"&gt;Imperial City&lt;/a&gt;, where &lt;a href=\"Sister%20Terran%20Arminus\"&gt;Sister Terran Arminus&lt;/a&gt; was sent to retrieve it. The events that transpired were miraculously predicted in the exact Elder Scroll she was sent to obtain. With the help of the &lt;a href=\"Undaunted\"&gt;Undaunted&lt;/a&gt;, Arminus was able to retrieve the Scroll as the group of adventurers defeated &lt;a href=\"Molag%20Kena\"&gt;Molag Kena&lt;/a&gt;, who had impersonated the Empress Regent, &lt;a href=\"Clivia%20Tharn\"&gt;Clivia Tharn&lt;/a&gt;.

In exchange of recovering the jewel from the Temple of the Mad God, Corim Ashlen promises to give the location of the Tower to the Eternal Champion.\nTemple of Mad God.\nThe Temple of Mad God is located south of Lillandril. It is composed of two levels which are roughly complex, however taking the correct path will make the quest much easier.\nThe First Level has a long river flooding its borders. The door to the Second Level is located south, and &lt;a href=\"Hell%20Hound\"&gt;Hell Hound&lt;/a&gt;s and &lt;a href=\"Skeleton%20%28Arena%29\"&gt;Skeletons&lt;/a&gt; will be roaming the way. Using the water to reach the door will make the quest take longer, besides being making the Champion somewhat vulnerable.\nOn the Second Level, the diamond remains on a room in the northeast area. On this floor, Priests will be guarding the corridors. There is no need to enter the greater corridors to reach the jewel.\nThe door to the room where the diamond remains will only open when the following riddle is answered:\n\"The area above the door is inscribed with the following:\"\n\"What flares up\"\n\"And does a lot of good,\"\n\"And when it dies\"\n\"Is just a piece of wood\"\nThe answer is \"Match\" or \"Torch.\"\nOnce the Diamond was taken, the Eternal Champion must give it back to Corim Ashlen at Lillandril. With the jewel in his hands, the Loremaster will fulfil his part of the exchange and inscribe the location of Crystal Tower on the map.\nNotes:"}

It is currently infested by enemy &lt;a href=\"Skeleton%20%28Online%29\"&gt;skeletons&lt;/a&gt;, and is one of the locations that &lt;a href=\"Razum-dar%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Razum-dar&lt;/a&gt; wants the &lt;a href=\"Vestige\"&gt;Vestige&lt;/a&gt; to investigate after arriving on the island.\nHistory.\nThe Temple of the Mourning Springs was created to house the &lt;a href=\"Mourning%20Stone\"&gt;Mourning Stone&lt;/a&gt;, which powers the fountain in the courtyard with its unending reserves. Unbeknownst to all, however, is that the temple also serves as a prison for the &lt;a href=\"Maormer\"&gt;Maormer&lt;/a&gt; wizard, &lt;a href=\"Uldor\"&gt;Uldor&lt;/a&gt;, and that the Mourning Stone serves to keep him trapped.\nJust prior to the Vestige's arrival on Khenarthi's Roost, &lt;a href=\"Ealcil\"&gt;Ealcil&lt;/a&gt;, an &lt;a href=\"Aldmeri%20Dominion%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Aldmeri Dominion&lt;/a&gt; scholar, &lt;a href=\"Rurelion\"&gt;Rurelion&lt;/a&gt;, a Dominion mage, and &lt;a href=\"Gathwen\"&gt;Gathwen&lt;/a&gt;, Rurelion's apprentice, embarked on an expedition into the Temple of the Mourning Springs. After removing the Mourning stone, the group was attacked by &lt;a href=\"Undead%20%28Online%29\"&gt;undead&lt;/a&gt;, who, unbeknownst to them, were controlled by Uldor. As the undead captured Rurelion, Ealcil successfully retreated with the Mourning Stone to &lt;a href=\"Eagle%27s%20Strand\"&gt;Eagle's Strand&lt;/a&gt;, while Gathwen remained outside the temple, looking for someone to help get her master back.\nSublocations.\nThe Temple of the Mourning Springs possesses both an elaborate exterior and a multi-roomed interior. Both are patrolled by enemies prior to completing \"Tears of the Two Moons.\" \nExterior.\nOn the path toward the front gate, a campsite can be found, set up by the expedition group. There will be several leveled &lt;a href=\"Weapons%20%28Online%29\"&gt;weapons&lt;/a&gt; next to the tent on a rack. On the table in the tent closest to the temple is another weapon, as well as some supplies, &lt;a href=\"Food%20%28Online%29\"&gt;food&lt;/a&gt;, and a &lt;a href=\"Rat%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Rat&lt;/a&gt;. Behind the table is a &lt;a href=\"Thieves%20Trove\"&gt;Thieves Trove&lt;/a&gt;; on the ground inside this tent as well is \"&lt;a href=\"Wind-Ripped%20Page\"&gt;Wind-Ripped Page&lt;/a&gt;\". Near one of the smaller tents is \"&lt;a href=\"Bolga%27s%20Guide%20to%20Island%20Beasts\"&gt;Bolga's Guide to Island Beasts&lt;/a&gt;\" and more supplies. An &lt;a href=\"Alit%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Alit&lt;/a&gt; will be in the area from time to time, so anyone staying in the area will have to kill it or flee.\nA similar camp with several dead &lt;a href=\"Crosstree%20Bandits\"&gt;Crosstree Bandits&lt;/a&gt; lies near the southernmost entrance. In addition to several more rats and a leveled weapon or two, \"\" can be found on the table.\nTo get to the back of the temple, follow the path toward the north, which goes near another bandit camp; it will be occupied by Crosstree Bandits. Behind the temple on an altar is a simply locked chest, which must be &lt;a href=\"Lockpicking%20%28Online%29\"&gt;lock-picked&lt;/a&gt;, although dispatching the numerous &lt;a href=\"Harpy%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Harpies&lt;/a&gt; in the area will have to be done first. Down away from the ruins near the mountainside is another simply chest.\nCourtyard.\nThe outside courtyard, which is located between the walls, can be entered in any of three locations. &lt;a href=\"Skeletal%20Archer%20%28Creature%29\"&gt;Skeletal Archers&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Skeletal%20Warrior%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Skeletal Warriors&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Skeletal%20Cryomancer\"&gt;Skeletal Cryomancer&lt;/a&gt;s will patrol this area in great numbers. At the top of two opposing sets of stairs are where the two wards seal the temple entrance in \"Tears of the Two Moons,\" which are marked by either a spider or a scorpion sigil; each will have a &lt;a href=\"Revenant%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Revenant&lt;/a&gt; nearby. Once the wards are down, there are multiple ways to enter the temple catacombs; each room will have a nightstand, which can be looted to find a recipe or book. After Uldor has been defeated, the courtyard will be filled with friendly ghosts. Although some can be interacted with, none give any additional rewards or services.\nCatacombs.\nThe catacombs are the only place in the temple where enemies do not spawn. The room is quite large, and is filled with the remains of numerous non-&lt;a href=\"Khajiit%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Khajiit&lt;/a&gt;, which appear to have been placed with care. \"&lt;a href=\"Rurelion%27s%20Observation%20No.%201\"&gt;Rurelion's Observation No. 1&lt;/a&gt;\" can be found in this room, near the stairway, on the side closest to the combination puzzle. Near one of the entombed bodies as well is \"&lt;a href=\"Mourning%20Springs%20Burial%20Rites\"&gt;Mourning Springs Burial Rites&lt;/a&gt;\".\nThe puzzle can be solved by following the phases of the two moons. First, activate the farthest one to the left, which shows two new moons with the larger one, &lt;a href=\"Masser\"&gt;Masser&lt;/a&gt;, on top. Next, hit the second farthest to the right, which shows the same setup but with two crescents; then, the farthest right, which is two full moons; and finally, the second farthest to the left, which is two crescents, but with the smaller moon\u2014&lt;a href=\"Secunda\"&gt;Secunda&lt;/a&gt;\u2014on top. Entering this code will lower the barrier to the ritual room.\nCentral ruins.\nThe ritual room is where the Mourning Stone was originally located prior to its removal. The center of the room is paved, but the outer edges are filled with water, presumably from the Mourning Stone; four bone piles sit in them as well. &lt;a href=\"Frog\"&gt;Frog&lt;/a&gt;s will hop in the water, and can be looted for &lt;a href=\"Guts\"&gt;Guts&lt;/a&gt;. \"&lt;a href=\"Rurelion%27s%20Observation%20No.%202\"&gt;Rurelion's Observation No. 2&lt;/a&gt;\" and \"&lt;a href=\"Ealcil%27s%20Journal\"&gt;Ealcil's Journal&lt;/a&gt;\" can be found in the room, near the entrance on top of some crates.\nOnce Uldor reveals himself to be controlling Rurelion's body, he will summon more skeletons to attack anyone else inside. These enemies are only temporary, for once Gathwen dispels the bone piles, they will stop appearing.\nGreat hall.\nStill more water from the Mourning Stone appears in the Great hall, which is filled with hazards: &lt;a href=\"Giant%20Bat%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Giant Bats&lt;/a&gt; patrol the area, and spike traps protrude from the ground. One must \"step lightly\" in order to get through the entire room, which can be done by either going to the left or to the right.\nBoth corners near the stairs to the ritual room have some loot-able urns, although the area to the right also has an extra Giant Bat to deal with; also near the entryway stairs is \"&lt;a href=\"Rurelion%27s%20Observation%20No.%203\"&gt;Rurelion's Observation No. 3&lt;/a&gt;\". Both sides have a side room, with nightstands in each; they can provide respite from the enemies and traps if needed. To the right of the stairwell to Uldor's tomb lies the \"&lt;a href=\"Lost%20and%20Dusty%20Journal\"&gt;Lost and Dusty Journal&lt;/a&gt;\".\nUldor's tomb.\nThe opening to Uldor's tomb is simply a square hallway, which goes around a center wall. Uldor will be waiting for whoever the Vestige chose to sacrifice, and so looting the area near the door may not be as easy until after his defeat, for Uldor will blast the area with shock spells. In the larger of the two areas, four pedestals sit in each corner, and the Moarmer's body can be found in the center of the room, surrounded by candles and a rut filled with water.\nQuests.\n&lt;a href=\"Tears%20of%20the%20Two%20Moons\"&gt;Tears of the Two Moons&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe entirety of the quest takes place in or around the Temple of the Mourning Springs. Gathwen will lead the Vestige to the temple; the pair is halted by Uldor, but only briefly, making their way through the courtyard. The wards guard the entrance, and are taken down by the two before progressing through. Uldor will attempt to attack with more of his undead minions, but is fought off by Rurelion. Once the Vestige finds him, he or she must decide whether to lock him with the Moarmer wizard or to use Gathwen instead. The Mourning Stone is retrieved by whoever was not chosen, and put back where it belongs, turning on the fountain again, and freeing the souls under Uldor's control."}

Look closer, in case these are effigies to animal gods, worshiped by &lt;a href=\"Ysgramor%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Ysgramor&lt;/a&gt;'s primitives. The deification of the bear, dragon, fox, moth, owl, snake, whale, and wolf have all been recorded by our field agents, and many believe these totems stand as sentinels over lost ruins. These tumbledown temples, guarded by half-woken &lt;a href=\"Draugr%20%28Online%29\"&gt;draugr&lt;/a&gt; and worse, are from a time when the &lt;a href=\"Dragon%20Cult\"&gt;Dragon Cult&lt;/a&gt; supposedly ruled this province.\nWhile no modern &lt;a href=\"Tamriel\"&gt;Tamriel&lt;/a&gt;an need believe these hopelessly fanciful fables, the Nords' simple-minded veneration for these places betokens their fear of the return of the &lt;a href=\"Dragon%20Priests%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Dragon Priests&lt;/a&gt;. During the worship of &lt;a href=\"Akatosh\"&gt;Akatosh&lt;/a&gt; (the dragon) as god-kings over men, these priests were the conduit through which &lt;a href=\"Dragons%20%28Lore%29\"&gt;dragons&lt;/a&gt; spoke, made laws, and were honored with grand and elaborate temples. When &lt;a href=\"Alduin\"&gt;Alduin&lt;/a&gt;, Akatosh's firstborn, was defeated atop the &lt;a href=\"Throat%20of%20the%20World%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Throat of the World&lt;/a&gt; during the mythical &lt;a href=\"Dragon%20War\"&gt;Dragon War&lt;/a&gt;, the cult that sprang up around these dragon guardians soon receded into the soil, buried among &lt;a href=\"Dragon%20Mound%20%28Online%29\"&gt;dragon mounds&lt;/a&gt; with the remains of these beasts. They were finally vanquished in &lt;a href=\"The%20Rift%20%28Online%29\"&gt;the Rift&lt;/a&gt; mountains by &lt;a href=\"Harald\"&gt;High King Harald&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"1E%20140\"&gt;1E 140&lt;/a&gt;.

As part of the Application, Headmaster Viarmo wants me to find and bring to him King Olaf's Verse.\"\nWalkthrough.\nThe quest begins inside the Bards College with Viarmo, the headmaster of the college, who approaches the Dragonborn as soon as they first enter the college to speak with them. Upon speaking to him, the Dragonborn is given a dialogue option to ask for admission. He then tells the story of King Olaf's Verse, which was thought to be lost when the king ordered the copies destroyed. However, one copy is suspected to be with the bard at Dead Men's Respite. Viarmo then asks the Dragonborn to retrieve the book from the dungeon. The marker for the dungeon shows up on the map, south of &lt;a href=\"Solitude%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Solitude&lt;/a&gt;.\nKing Olaf's Verse.\nThe ancient barrow is located in the mountains southwest of &lt;a href=\"Morthal%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Morthal&lt;/a&gt; and the Dragonborn will, immediately upon entering, notice a strange ghost wave at them, then disappear through the sealed entrance to the north. Pick up the &lt;a href=\"Ruby%20Dragon%20Claw\"&gt;Ruby Dragon Claw&lt;/a&gt; from the table, which will cause four of the previously dead &lt;a href=\"Draugr%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;draugr&lt;/a&gt; enemies to reanimate and attack, but will also raise the gate and allow them to follow the ghost. It soon becomes clear that the ghost shows the correct path, so follow it and pull the chain at the dead end.\nThe next area is a maze-like tomb where the Dragonborn will have to pull several chains to open up different areas. Use the map to make sure to access the easternmost room for a copy of the &lt;a href=\"Speech\"&gt;Speech&lt;/a&gt; skill book \"&lt;a href=\"The%20Buying%20Game\"&gt;The Buying Game&lt;/a&gt;\", guarded by a well-placed battering ram. Watch out for several draugr and &lt;a href=\"Frostbite%20Spider%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;frostbite spiders&lt;/a&gt; and continue north. Beware of the pressure plate at the foot of the stairs, which will release a flame trap.\nFight the spiders in the next room, loot the shelves for some potions and soul gems then pull the chain, which will open the grating in the floor and reveal a watery pit. Take the plunge and proceed forward to a chamber with several enemies, including an archer on the ledge above.\nProceed to the level above and disarm the tripwire on the gate before opening it, or it will trigger several swinging blade traps. Pull the chain at the far side of the bridge to make them stop. Go up another level and open the huge door.\nAt the end of the next tunnel, use the Arcane Enchanter if necessary, then turn around and watch the ghostly guide disappear through yet another door; due to a magical seal they are not allowed to follow, so continue through another set of catacombs and fight draugr or a &lt;a href=\"Draugr%20Deathlord%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Draugr Deathlord&lt;/a&gt;, depending on level, with two sleeping draugr in alcoves. The expert locked door hides a master locked treasure chest, with a boss-leveled amount of gold.\nIn the next chamber, the gate will shut behind the Dragonborn and five draugr will attack. After the battle, explore the southeastern room for a chest, but beware of the dart trap protecting it. Pull the chain and head down the stairs in the center of the room. Activate the handle to the left and watch the rock wall lower and behold the sight of the ghost sitting next to the decaying corpse of &lt;a href=\"Svaknir\"&gt;Svaknir&lt;/a&gt;, the Bard executed for questioning the King in ancient times. The Dragonborn cannot interact with the ghost, but the corpse still holds the forbidden Verse, so claim it and learn the truth behind the annual Festival in Solitude. As soon as the Verse is taken, the ghost disappears and the Dragonborn\u00a0will have no choice but to backtrack through the catacombs. Svaknir's corpse can be looted for some gold as well before or after claiming the book held in its hand.\nOn the way back, the ghost of Svaknir is near the magically sealed door. He will turn towards the door and break the barrier and run headfirst into the chamber. Follow him to a Nordic puzzle door; it is finally time to investigate the ruby dragon claw found when the Dragonborn\u00a0initially entered the barrow, so take an extra look to find the symbols Wolf, Hawk, Wolf. Proceed forward and prepare for a lengthy battle.\nIn the final chamber, the ghost of Svaknir will stand in the middle of a small pond, surrounded by draugr all seated on thrones. There are eight on the ground floor, and an additional four on the ledge in the other end of the room. Everything seems quiet, until getting close to the ghost. With sufficient &lt;a href=\"Sneak%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;sneak&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Archery%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Archery&lt;/a&gt;, it is possible to take out all of the sleeping draugr before getting close to Svaknir's ghost. This will make the latter fight easier. When the Dragonborn does get close to him, he will then shout out:\n\"Olaf! It is time!\"\nHis words will make the entire room tremble and the first wave of draugr enemies will rise from their thrones and attack. As a ghost, Svaknir is immortal and will pick up the fight, so help him out to defeat them. When all eight enemies are slain, Svaknir will shout:\n\"Arise, Olaf! My vengeance is at hand!\"\nThis will make the four draugr on the ledge rise and attack, so once again help Svaknir get his revenge. These draugr are all higher level than the first ones, but Svaknir will once again prove his skills and help to defeat them. When they are dead, he again\u00a0shouts out:\n\"Olaf!\"\nThis will finally cause &lt;a href=\"Olaf%20One-Eye\"&gt;Olaf One-Eye&lt;/a&gt; himself, a leveled draugr boss, to burst out of his coffin screaming:\n\"Insolent Bard. Die!\"\nHe will then attack both Svaknir and the Dragonborn. He can be a tough opponent, as he will almost always be armed with an ebony sword or war axe, or if fought at a lower level, an Ancient Nord weapon, and also can use the &lt;a href=\"Thu%27um\"&gt;Thu'um&lt;/a&gt;, such as &lt;a href=\"Frost%20Breath\"&gt;Frost Breath&lt;/a&gt;, but will eventually fall to the ground and die. The tormented soul of Svaknir will finally be set free; he will head to the nearby door, pull out his lute and disappear in a ray of light, ascending to &lt;a href=\"Sovngarde%20%28Location%29\"&gt;Sovngarde&lt;/a&gt;. Loot Olaf's corpse for the key to his treasury, then examine the Word Wall behind his coffin for a word of the Whirlwind &lt;a href=\"Dragon%20Shout\"&gt;Dragon Shout&lt;/a&gt;. Examine the area for considerable loot \u2013 each draugr has at least some gold. Unlock the treasury door and examine the chest and surroundings for loot, then pull the lever and leave the barrow.\nReturn to Viarmo.\nReturn with the verse and bring it to Viarmo, who begins to read it. He mentions that the verses are incomplete.\nAsk him about recreating the verses, and he gives it a shot. The first verse talks about King Olaf's capture of the dragon &lt;a href=\"Numinex\"&gt;Numinex&lt;/a&gt; being a con. The three options to select are:\nThe second verse talks about his conquest of &lt;a href=\"Skyrim\"&gt;Skyrim&lt;/a&gt;, and the Siege of Solitude. The three options to select are:\nPerformance of the Verse.\nOnce the Dragonborn meets Viarmo in the palace, he will approach the &lt;a href=\"Elisif%20the%20Fair\"&gt;Jarl&lt;/a&gt; and begin to read the verse:\nNo matter the lines chosen, Elisif will be impressed enough to reinstate the festival and provides to the college a reward of varying significance - \"moderate\", \"generous\", or \"very generous\" - depending on the reconstructed verse. Viarmo thanks the Dragonborn, then tells them to talk to &lt;a href=\"Jorn\"&gt;Jorn&lt;/a&gt; inside the college. Talk to Jorn, then wait until after 8:00 PM to talk to him again if necessary.\nThe Burning of King Olaf.\nOnce outside, head to the right and into the overlook. Speaking with Evette and Sorex will earn some free items from them, and the treats Bendt provided along with some extra bottles of Evette's spiced wine can be taken without repercussions. Viarmo will set an effigy of King Olaf on fire, and announces to the crowd that the Dragonborn is now officially a bard. He then personally congratulates them on their work, informs them of several other quests offered by the college professors, and provides their share of the reward from the Jarl, a sum depending on their level and the reconstructed verse; at max effective level, the latter range is between 750 (1.2&gt;2.2) and 1800 (1.3&gt;2.3P) gold.\nFestival Participants.\nThe following Bards College members and Solitude residents will be present at the Festival and their reactions are listed in the table below:"}

In my father's hall of business in Wayrest I learned of the tracking of shipments, the balancing of accounts, and the fluctuation of currencies, but &lt;a href=\"Pierric\"&gt;Pierric&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"Cumberland%20Dynasty\"&gt;Cumberland&lt;/a&gt; knew the nature of the world, and he was not content to have his son learn only of the ways of peace and trade. Every morning I sparred with the Cumberland Master of Arms, and every afternoon the weather permitted I rode a warhorse, exercising with the &lt;a href=\"Menevia%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Menevia&lt;/a&gt; Heavy Dragoons. It wasn't just practice: for two months every summer, I traveled as lieutenant of the mounted escort of the Evermore Caravan, and a half-dozen times we fought off hill &lt;a href=\"Bandits%20%28Online%29\"&gt;bandits&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Goblin%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Goblin&lt;/a&gt; raiders, and &lt;a href=\"Reachmen%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Reachmen&lt;/a&gt; war bands.\nI was fortunate to have spent so much time with a hilt in my hand, for in 2E 541, when I was but twenty, &lt;a href=\"Durcorach%20the%20Black%20Drake\"&gt;Durcorach the Black Drake&lt;/a&gt; spread his wings in &lt;a href=\"the%20Reach\"&gt;the Reach&lt;/a&gt; and mustered his feral tribesmen to war. Erupting from their mountain lairs like ants from a kicked anthill, the Reachmen howled down into &lt;a href=\"Bangkorai\"&gt;Bangkorai&lt;/a&gt;, burning and looting. After only three days' siege, &lt;a href=\"Evermore%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Evermore&lt;/a&gt; fell to this horde. The land was pillaged and its people massacred. &lt;a href=\"Hallin%27s%20Stand\"&gt;Hallin's Stand&lt;/a&gt; held out longer, but eventually it was also overrun by the heathen swarm. Within days, they were across the &lt;a href=\"Bjoulsae%20River\"&gt;Bjoulsae&lt;/a&gt; and bearing down upon Wayrest.\nThen all were grateful that King &lt;a href=\"Gardner%20Dynasty\"&gt;Gardner&lt;/a&gt; had built new walls and battlements around Wayrest, for the town had grown so that it had burst the bounds of the old walls. Throngs of people swarmed in from the countryside, and soon it seemed that all Menevia &lt;a href=\"Gavaudon%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Gavaudon&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Alcaire%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Alcaire&lt;/a&gt; were within the city walls. But when the Reachman storm burst upon Wayrest, the crowded conditions seemed a small price to pay for protection from the fury of those &lt;a href=\"Daedra%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Daedra&lt;/a&gt;-loving heathens.\nThus began the epic Siege of Wayrest, when for fifty-seven days and nights the &lt;a href=\"Bretons%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Bretons&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"Stormhaven%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Stormhaven&lt;/a&gt; manned the walls and repulsed the savage assaults of our terrible opponents. The Reachmen, lacking siege engines, were unable to breach our new walls and take the city by storm, and lacking ships they were unable to blockade our harbor and reduce the city by starvation. Stalemate: was Durcorach's invasion of High Rock at an end?\nIndeed, no: your Reachman warrior, though fearless and fierce, is not as a rule very patient. The Black Drake left enough troops in the revetments around our walls to keep us bottled up inside and simply marched off west into &lt;a href=\"Glenumbra%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Glenumbra&lt;/a&gt;. Taken by surprise, the newly-independent city-state of &lt;a href=\"Camlorn%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Camlorn&lt;/a&gt; fell and was sacked. And then Durcorach turned his eyes south, toward Daggerfall.\nFortunately, King Gardner heeded my advice to use our merchant ships as transports for the Heavy Dragoons. That was how I found myself at the head of the lances of Wayrest's finest as we charged into the rear of the Reachmen massed before Daggerfall's city gates. All Bretons know how the Black Drake's warriors were caught completely by surprise, how I smote Durcorach and tore down his Unholy Banner. They know of the sortie of the Knights of Daggerfall in which King Bergamot finished the work we'd begun, scattering the broken army of heathens like autumn leaves before a gale.\nOnly one fortnight after that I watched, head bowed, as the kings of Daggerfall, Camlorn, &lt;a href=\"Shornhelm%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Shornhelm&lt;/a&gt;, Evermore, and Wayrest signed the first &lt;a href=\"Daggerfall%20Covenant\"&gt;Daggerfall Covenant&lt;/a&gt;."}

King Ranser of &lt;a href=\"Shornhelm%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Shornhelm&lt;/a&gt; had a goodly daughter, Princess Rayelle, and her hand was offered to me by my brother of Shornhelm both early and often.

From that moment, I swore that Wayrest would have no queen but Maraya. Of course, there was another unexpected benefit: as her dowry, she brought a trade agreement between our two states that resulted in great prosperity for all.\nKing Ranser, alas, was wroth that I had not accepted the hand of his daughter, and he withdrew his ambassador from the court of Wayrest. Although Ranser was invited to my wedding to Maraya in the spring of 566, like the other kings of the &lt;a href=\"Daggerfall%20Covenant\"&gt;Covenant&lt;/a&gt;, he stayed, seething, in Shornhelm.\nI should perhaps have paid more attention to Ranser's choler, but I was so taken with my new bride and trade issues around the &lt;a href=\"Iliac%20Bay\"&gt;Iliac Bay&lt;/a&gt; that mountainous Shornhelm seemed distant and irrelevant. That mistake almost cost me my throne.\nFor over a year, Ranser had been quietly mustering his troops and emptying his treasury to hire mercenaries. In Last Seed of 2E 566, he led his army out of Shornhelm in a lightning strike to the south. Ranser had marched through Alcaire and Menevia almost before we were aware of his approach. The Shornhelm advance guard reached the gates of Wayrest while the local militias we had quickly mustered were still filing through them. This was a moment when history trembled upon a cusp: if the attacking Oldgate Lancers scattered our militia and took the gate, Wayrest could fall to her attackers within the hour.\nFortunately, I was personally present at the gate, along with my Cumberland Guard. Recognizing the gravity of the situation, I had my bannerman sound the charge. I led the gate guards and my household troops out against the Oldgate Lancers. My men wore full armor, and I, though unarmored, bore at my side the mighty Orichalc Scalpel, an enchanted broadsword of many virtues. The Scalpel, drawn for the first time in anger, flashed and hummed like a blade in a sawmill as we hurled ourselves upon the Lancers. Our enemies, who suddenly found themselves opposed by armored veterans rather than panicky irregulars, were further confounded by the sudden onset of a thunderstorm. Lashed by hail, their horses terrified by lightning, faced with the &lt;a href=\"Orichalcum%20Ore%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Orichalc&lt;/a&gt; Scalpel scything through their necks and limbs, the vaunted Oldgate Lancers hesitated, then broke and ran, pell-mell, from the gate.\nBy the time Ranser's main forces arrived on the scene, our troops were all within the walls. The gates were shut up tight, but the King of Shornhelm was undeterred. The city of Wayrest found itself once more under siege, and Ranser, with more craft and foresight than the Reachman Durcorach, had come with siege engines in his train."}

These &lt;a href=\"Creatures%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;creatures&lt;/a&gt; have three beady black eyes, their &lt;a href=\"Troll%20Skull%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;skulls&lt;/a&gt; being easily recognized by their three eye sockets. Commonly found in forests, such as &lt;a href=\"The%20Rift%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;the Rift&lt;/a&gt;, trolls also inhabit &lt;a href=\"Caves%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;caves&lt;/a&gt;, ruins, and mountains. While they are not\u00a0very intelligent, Trolls compensate with tough physical prowess and the ability to &lt;a href=\"Regenerate%20Health%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;regenerate health&lt;/a&gt;, which makes them very hard to kill at lower levels. Many trolls may\u00a0display a &lt;a href=\"Weakness%20to%20Fire%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;weakness to fire damage&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Spells%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;spells&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Enchanting%20%28Skyrim%29%23Weapon%20enchantments\"&gt;weapon enchantments&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Poison%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;poisons&lt;/a&gt; that deal &lt;a href=\"Fire%20Damage%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;fire damage&lt;/a&gt; or raise susceptibility to fire damage.\nVariants.\nArmored Trolls.\nThe large armored trolls are fierce animal companions.

An armored troll will leave the &lt;a href=\"last%20Dragonborn\"&gt;Dragonborn's&lt;/a&gt; services if told to wait somewhere for too long. The armored troll counts as an animal companion, so the Dragonborn cannot have an armored troll and another animal companion at the same time. There are two types of armored trolls: normal trolls and frost trolls. To get an armored frost troll, the Dragonborn must be at least level 20.\nFrost Trolls.\nFrost trolls are larger in size than those found in &lt;a href=\"Cyrodiil\"&gt;Cyrodiil&lt;/a&gt;, but are much slower as well. Frost Trolls are considerably stronger than regular Trolls, and are tough adversaries.\nTrolls are weak to &lt;a href=\"Fire%20Damage%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;fire damage&lt;/a&gt; and resistant to &lt;a href=\"Frost%20Damage%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;frost damage&lt;/a&gt;.

I'll even share with you my tried-and-true secret for killing trolls. Intrigued? I hope so! &lt;a href=\"Troll%20Fat%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Troll Fat&lt;/a&gt; is a valuable commodity and there's a fortune and glory to be made for the ambitious troll hunter.\nOnward, then!\nChapter I: I Just Saw A &lt;a href=\"Troll%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Troll&lt;/a&gt;!\nIf you think you've seen a troll, remain calm and slowly back away. The wise hunter knows that preparation is the key to success, and you certainly don't want to hunt any trolls unprepared!\nAh, but is it really a troll that you've spotted?\nThe first step in your hunt is the proper identification of your quarry. Trolls are roughly man-shaped, with lengthy, muscular arms that end in claw-tipped fingers. The creature's large mouth is filled with jagged teeth, all the better to crunch the bones of foolish hunters who didn't purchase my book.\nWithout a doubt, the troll's most distinctive and unusual feature is the third eye nestled in the center of its forehead.\nA troll's hide is covered in thick, shaggy fur. The coloration of this fur varies by region. Cave troll fur is brownish in color, while a frost or snow troll will have a white coat.\nChapter II: Stop Healing Yourself.\nSo, you've properly identified a troll and now you're stalking the beast, ready to strike. You're in for a challenging battle, but a profitable one, assuming you survive.\nThe first thing you'll notice is that trolls are incredibly fast and strong for their size. A troll likes to pummel its prey into submission with powerful arm strikes and claw attacks. For this reason, I strongly recommend a shield.\nIf you're brave enough\u2014or foolish enough\u2014to fight without using a shield, then you'd better be an expert at parrying with whatever weapon you've got.\nTrolls also have the ability to rapidly heal from their wounds. As such, you do not want to get into a prolonged fight with one. Speed and aggression are the key to beating a troll, because there is no creature in Tamriel that can outlast one.\nOf course, speed and aggression will only take you so far against an angry troll. This is where my secret weapon comes in.\nChapter III: Finn's Secret Weapon.\nFire, my friend. Say the word and commit it to memory, for fire is the troll-hunter's ultimate weapon.\nI can not overstate the importance of fire in battling a troll. Even trolls that don't dwell in cold climates are vulnerable to fire. If you're unable to use fire magic, carry a weapon enchanted with arcane flames.\nWhy is the troll vulnerable to fire? Rumor holds that troll's regenerative abilities are less effective at healing burns. I don't really know the answer, but I can promise you this - fire works against trolls. This has been proven time and again.\nChapter IV: Trimming The Fat.\nThe troll might be dead, but your job isn't finished just yet.\nLet the flames die down and then examine the troll's corpse. If you're lucky you'll find some &lt;a href=\"Troll%20Fat%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;fat deposits&lt;/a&gt; that will fetch a good price in an apothecary's shop. In fact, if you've got a knack for alchemy yourself, you can boil the fat down for use in all manner of potions and tonics.\nIf you can find it, be sure to check the troll's den as well. Perhaps you'll find the remains of some foolish adventurer who was too cheap-minded to purchase this book.\nNo doubt you can put his coin to wiser use.\nNow you know everything that you need to make a living as a wealthy and reputable troll hunter. Go on, then! Get out there and find yourself some trolls!"}

After speaking to Destane, the Fugitive must find the ruins. \nOn their way to the ruins, the Hero comes across a Spriggan Earth Mother. Shortly after defeating the creature, the first secret area can be found on the right of the ruined pillars. Here, a Great Wispmother protects the treasures.\nAdvancing further among the main trail, another Spriggan Earth Mother is encountered, until a cave is reached. In front of the cave is an Ancient Troll, which has to be killed to advance further. Inside the cave, a Dremora Raider is found near the first large opening, with another Dremora Warlock being close by. Beyond the Warlock is a locked wooden door.\nDeeper into the cave, a small campsite is found, housing another Dremora Warlock and Raider. Advancing further results in the Hero exiting the cave, encountering three Mercenaries at another campsite in the forest. The first of which carries a key to the locked door encountered prior. This opens the area leading to the second secret, which can be unlocked by pulling a lever. Within this room, another Ancient Troll is encountered.\nOnly a little further, Destane is encountered. Fully armored, he summons a Dremora Raider, who attacks the Hero. Approaching Destane triggers a dialogue, where he makes his true intentions clear. He aims to kill the Hero for the death of his sister. Upon slaying Destane, the quest is completed."}

He will tell you that there is a problem with giant beetles plaguing the water supply, and that you should speak with &lt;a href=\"Overseer%20Jahi\"&gt;Overseer Jahi&lt;/a&gt; if you wish to help. \nJahi will be in the north of the fields. Speak with her and she will tell you that the johads, the water collecting devices, are contaminated with some kind of poison that is also attracting these beetles. She will also suspect that her brother is involved somehow. Jahi will then ask you to investigate the resting camps of the workers, to see if someone brought in the poison. The camps will be to your southwest. In one of the camps, you will indeed find a suspicious vial. The moment you pick it up, Jahi's brother &lt;a href=\"Almur\"&gt;Almur&lt;/a&gt; will show up; speak with him and he will tell you that he wants to solve this crisis as much as his sister does, but that he does not know anything more than you do. He will ask you to do a taste test to confirm that the contents of the vial are indeed the same as what is in the johads. \n\"&lt;There's a visible tint of sickly green in the water, and the bitter taste is very strong.&gt;\"\n\"&lt;The water tastes sweet, but still has the distinct smell that matches the contents of the bottle.&gt;\"\n\"&lt;The water has a bitter flavor, not at all like what rainwater should taste like.&gt;\"\nHead over to the three johads and sample the water. You will find that the water tastes very bitter, like the contents of the vial. With this information, head back to Jahi. She will tell you that this is the kind of vial used by Almur's wife &lt;a href=\"Ohama\"&gt;Ohama&lt;/a&gt; in her alchemy practice. Ohama will be in the house to the east, tending to Almur and Jahi's father &lt;a href=\"Naseiran\"&gt;Naseiran&lt;/a&gt;. Speak with her and she will tell you she thought she had misplaced this bottle; she had no idea it was stolen and used to contaminate the water. She does have an idea for how to track down the thief though. There is a lizard peddler outside, &lt;a href=\"Vena\"&gt;Vena&lt;/a&gt;. Her lizards might be able to track the scent on the vial and point out which of the workers handled it.\nHead outside and talk to Vena. You can either buy a lizard from her or intimidate her into giving you one. Either way, take the lizard to the workers' camps. Search around for a bit, and you will find the lizard approaching various workers. Eventually, a man called &lt;a href=\"Fermouzh\"&gt;Fermouzh&lt;/a&gt; will say that this has gone on long enough; he will tell you and Jahi what's going on. Follow him to Jahi's location and speak to him there. He will tell you that some of the workers may have been bribed by someone to poison the johads; he cannot tell you who because the man that offered the bribes was obscured by shadows when they spoke. He will tell you the dropoff point was inside Jadi's home, where you spoke with Ohama. \n\"&lt;The leftover food smells of the same musk used in the johads.&gt;\"\n\"&lt;Jahi's father slept here just a little while ago. He's no longer in bed, but there's no signs of a struggle.&gt;\"\n\"&lt;Ohama keeps her potions in this dresser. There are several broken bottles inside, as if someone was searching for something quickly and carelessly.&gt;\"\nHead into the home and investigate. You will find that Naseiran has left with no signs of struggle, and that there are several broken vials in Ohama's alchemy cabinet as if someone was looking for something hastily. Once your search is done, Almur will come in; speak with him and he will tell you to use the lizard to track whoever was in here. Head outside and follow the beetle; it will lead you to Naseiran, who has been gravely injured by one of the beetles. You will witness a scene where Jahi and Almur confront their father before he dies of his wounds. \nIt turns out that Naseiran poisoned the johads as part of a scheme to prevent his children from selling them. Speak to Jahi and Almur and you will find out that neither of them ever wanted the johads, but that their father wanted Jahi to have them. The decision for who gets the Johads will now fall to you. The quest will finish once you make your choice."}

Even the once-promising Emperor Varen fell victim to Daedric corruption, his reforms swept away by the puppet-masters of the Daedric Cabal.\nThe Daggerfall Covenant is the only true heir to the principles of the Second Empire. In the name of the Divines, we must conquer &lt;a href=\"Cyrodiil%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Cyrodiil&lt;/a&gt; and restore the glory of Reman's legacy. The cancerous Daedra worship that has corrupted Cyrodiil and threatens all Nirn shall be cleansed from Tamriel.

Talk to him, and he'll tell you that he and his fighters guild companions were ambushed by the Daedra, and that his friends were taken prisoner in the Tower, which is actually a deep pit rather than a tower. He will tell you that the only way into the \"tower\" is to jump down into the water below you. \nJump in. There is a skyshard on the southern end of the pool where you land, so be sure to pick that up. once you're down there, talk with &lt;a href=\"Skordo%20the%20Knife\"&gt;Skordo the Knife&lt;/a&gt;. He will tell you that a dremora called &lt;a href=\"Ifriz%20the%20Unraveler\"&gt;Ifriz the Unraveler&lt;/a&gt; runs this place through tricks and illusions, and that not everyone down here is Fighters Guild; there's even a dremora down here. His captains &lt;a href=\"Captain%20Eilram\"&gt;Eilram&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Captain%20Arakh\"&gt;Arakh&lt;/a&gt; are on the level above; the daedra keep them separated. He will ask you to rescue his friends from the Ogrims here while he goes to deal with the Overseer. \nThe dremora here is &lt;a href=\"Lyranth\"&gt;Lyranth&lt;/a&gt;; you can find her around the ground floor. If you talk to her however, she will reveal no information to you. As for the fighters guild members you were told to rescue, you will find the body of &lt;a href=\"Borgath%20the%20Axe\"&gt;Borgath the Axe&lt;/a&gt; in a cave to the south; he has been recently killed. Sinfay can be found in the northern cave and &lt;a href=\"Vikord%20Skullcleaver\"&gt;Vikord Skullcleaver&lt;/a&gt; is in the east; both are still alive. Once you've rescued them, meet Skordo outside the Overseer's Chamber, in the south of the area. Talk to him to inform him of what happened to his friends. He will tell you that the Overseer is currently in his quarters, and that you'll need to get a key from him to head up to the next level of the tower. \nHead into the Overseer's chamber. Combat should begin immediately. Once the Overseer is dead, grab the key from the chest in the corner, then head out of the room and to the east of the area, to the Liar's Passage where your allies will be waiting. They won't be joining you ahead though. Head through the passage to the other side; beware the many ogrims that guard this place. Once you're on the other side, you'll run into Lyranth again. She will again tell you very little of use, though she will inform you that this place currently has no exit. Either way, head on and speak with &lt;a href=\"Captain%20Eilram\"&gt;Captain Eilram&lt;/a&gt;, to the north. He will suspect that you're either a spy or an illusion, and will ask you to retrieve his sword from the Ogrims to prove that you're neither. The sword will be in the ogrim camp to the east. It will be under the tent on the eastern side f the camp. Take it, then head for Arakh's camp in the north of the area. and return the sword to Eilram there.\nA situation has developed here where Captain Arakh can barely restrain herself from attacking the other fighters guild members. She says she cannot stop the voices without her helmet, and that the &lt;a href=\"Watcher\"&gt;Watcher&lt;/a&gt;s have it. The watchers are to your south; the helmet can be found hanging from a crane over the abyss. Retrieve it and return to Arakh. This act and the following conversation she has with Eilram will break her free from the hold this place had on her. Lyranth will then appear and offer to help you take down Ifriz the Unraveler. Speak with her and she will tell you that Ifriz has created a barrier that prevents you from getting out of this place; you have to kill him before you can escape. Lyranth has taken down the illusions protecting Ifriz, so you can find him. \nIfriz is under the dome to the north. He will not be hostile until you approach him, so kill the watcher in the area first. Once he's dead, return to Captain Arakh. She will inform you that the portal out of here is working again, and that they found something that may be one of the fabled &lt;a href=\"Lights%20of%20Meridia\"&gt;Lights of Meridia&lt;/a&gt;. Head up to the portal; the light of Meridia will be right beside it. Take it and head through, then talk to Skordo on the other side to finish the quest."}
