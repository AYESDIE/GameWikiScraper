The Great Gear represents nature's primal engine, the source of life and power and that makes &lt;a href=\"Nirn\"&gt;Nirn&lt;/a&gt; thrive. It isn't a literal engine. The father of mysteries used the metaphorical idea of a primal engine to expound upon his teachings and philosophy. The apostles that learned from Lord Seht followed his example and built upon the metaphor to create a rich and expressive manner of speaking that sets them apart from other followers of the Tribunal.\nBy employing a variety of metaphors that utilize the working of gears and pistons to express emotions, thoughts, and intentions, the apostles have developed a distinct dialect that draws upon their vocation and beliefs. Here are some of their more cherished idioms, along with the meaning for those not fluent in the movements of the Great Gear.\n\"By the Great Gear!\" An exclamation of wonder and surprise, although it can also be used to proclaim shock or even horror in the appropriate circumstance.\n\"Never in a million clicks of the Great Gear.\" An idiom for emphasizing the impossibility of a given event or describing something that is unlikely to happen.\n\"The gears just have to align in my favor.\" An expression of hopeful intent, favorable conditions, or the desire for everything to come together in a positive way.\n\"When the gear slips.\" A phrase used to express something isn't quite right or a situation has become off kilter.\n\"Clogging up the gears.\" An expression that means something was spoiled, usually through blundering or stupidity.\n\"Before three gears click into place.\" A phrase used to hurry things along or to indicate that very little time has or will have passed.\n\"Caught in the gears.\" A statement of concern usually related to a difficult situation, a troublesome predicament, or a problem that doesn't have an easy solution.\n\"May your gears spin freely.\" A friendly farewell, wishing the recipient good wishes and continued success.\n\"May your pistons never clog.\" A phrase used to wish another person well as you send them on their way.\n\"May the Great Gear always spin in your direction.\" A way to wish good fortune upon a Clockwork Apostle or a close friend or associated not related to the order.\n\"Tighten the cogs.\" To shore up, reinforce, or make better.\n\"The clockwork is only as strong as its weakest cog.\" A phrase with a literal meaning, though the \"weakest cog\" also figuratively refers to a person or other flawed feature and not an actual cog.\n\"The Great Gear\" never pauses in its rotation.\" A phrase that assures us that time passes and that world moves on, whether we want it to or not.\n\"Spare a few more clicks of the Great Gear.\" A request to give someone or something your attention for a time.\n\"The Great Gear turns, so be quick, be quick.\" Time passes, so don't dawdle.\n\"Sometimes the Great Gear turns from frustration to opportunity.\" Any of several similar sayings that indicate that situations can change from favorable to unfavorable, or vice versa, usually by the whims of fate.\nAnd that is the sequence of the words."}

The Venerable &lt;a href=\"Ancirinque\"&gt;Ancirinque&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Sapiarch\"&gt;Sapiarch&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"Mythohistory\"&gt;Mythohistory&lt;/a&gt;, holds that certain difficult passages in &lt;a href=\"High%20Lord%20Torinaan\"&gt;Torinaan&lt;/a&gt;'s Journal indicate that runestones were already here when the Foresailor arrived from &lt;a href=\"Old%20Aldmeris\"&gt;Old Aldmeris&lt;/a&gt;. However, &lt;a href=\"Nolin%20the%20Many-Hued\"&gt;Nolin the Many-Hued&lt;/a&gt;, Sapiarch of Enchantment, contends that they date from the early &lt;a href=\"Merethic%20Era\"&gt;Merethic Era&lt;/a&gt;, and are the unintended consequence of an &lt;a href=\"Ayleid\"&gt;Ayleid&lt;/a&gt; wizard's experiment gone awry.\nWhatever the truth of their origin, after generations of study by the finest magical minds in the &lt;a href=\"Summerset%20Isles%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Summerset Isles&lt;/a&gt;, their various properties have nearly all been identified, and their uses in the enchantment of arms, armor, and ornaments are well understood. For general classification they fall into three categories, which we latter-day mages have dubbed Potency, Aspect, and Essence.\nFor enchantment purposes these three types of runestones can be understood as mystically complementary, for only by combining one of each category can the enchanter create a \"&lt;a href=\"glyph\"&gt;glyph&lt;/a&gt;,\" our term for the magical substance we use to endow an item with sorcerous power.\nHowever, though we know how to use runestones to create magical items, the enigma remains: what are they? We have named their tree standard categories &lt;a href=\"Potency\"&gt;Potency&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Aspect\"&gt;Aspect&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Essence\"&gt;Essence&lt;/a&gt;- but what does that mean? Even the great &lt;a href=\"Pharliz%20the%20Antic\"&gt;Pharliz the Antic&lt;/a&gt;, who gave them these names, even he, when asked what they meant, merely shrugged and replied, \"Those are the named that feel right to me.\"\nEven the fact that there are three kinds of runestones generates debate, as it seems to contradict the &lt;a href=\"Anu\"&gt;Anu&lt;/a&gt;-&lt;a href=\"Padomay\"&gt;Padu&lt;/a&gt; Theorem, which posits that duality is the foundation of the &lt;a href=\"Aurbis\"&gt;Aurbis&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href=\"Camilonwe\"&gt;Camilonwe&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"Lillandril%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Lillandril&lt;/a&gt; asserted that it was impossible that there were only three types of runestones, and spent the last two hundred years of his life searching for fourth, convinced that proper classification called for such entities to appear in dual pairs. He never found this \"quartonic runestone,\" which he dubbed &lt;a href=\"Celerity\"&gt;Celerity&lt;/a&gt;, but he insisted until the end that his theory was sound.\nWas Camilonwe right? Do Celerity runestones exist, but in some state of reality that makes them imperceptible to normal mortals? That is a question that is, so far, unanswerable."}

Well, I bet you didn't know Olmgerd the Outlaw, Harald's bastard, was buried as befits a Nord lord's son, in his ship, in a tomb deep in the mother rock.\nAnd of course they buried Stormkiss with him. Stormkiss was Olmgerd's enchanted battle-axe. And you see this old key? See what it says it on it? 'Stormkiss.' Here. Take it. Healer says the mazte is killing me. I'm going home to Skyrim to die. You, you got your life ahead of you. Go ahead. Take it.\nThey say they buried Olmgerd in the bottom of an ancient Dunmer tomb. From the skald's telling, the burial was on a long finger of land on the southeast coast of Vvardenfell, on a little island close to shore on the west coast of the peninsula. Figure it's somewhere on the stretch between the Daedric ruins at Zaintiraris and Tel Branora. Gods be with you. And thank you for the mazte."}

He can usually be found either in the &lt;a href=\"Hall%20of%20Attainment\"&gt;Hall of Attainment&lt;/a&gt; on the second floor toward the northwest in his room or at &lt;a href=\"The%20Frozen%20Hearth\"&gt;The Frozen Hearth&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Winterhold%20%28Skyrim%20City%29\"&gt;Winterhold&lt;/a&gt;.\nHe was close friends with &lt;a href=\"Gallus%20Desidenius\"&gt;Gallus Desidenius&lt;/a&gt;, the former &lt;a href=\"guildmaster\"&gt;guildmaster&lt;/a&gt; of the &lt;a href=\"Thieves%20Guild%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Thieves Guild&lt;/a&gt;. He describes their first meeting as an amusing anecdote, as Gallus broke into his laboratory and, rather than flee from Enthir or fight him, made an interesting comment on his notes. It ended up with them having a long discussion and the two of them becoming friends.\nInteractions.\n&lt;a href=\"Arniel%27s%20Endeavor\"&gt;Arniel's Endeavor&lt;/a&gt;.\nEnthir is involved with two parts of this questline: Firstly he sends the &lt;a href=\"Last%20Dragonborn\"&gt;Dragonborn&lt;/a&gt; to recover the &lt;a href=\"Staff%20of%20Tandil\"&gt;Staff of Tandil&lt;/a&gt; in exchange for the &lt;a href=\"Warped%20Soul%20Gem\"&gt;Warped Soul Gem&lt;/a&gt; ordered by &lt;a href=\"Arniel%20Gane\"&gt;Arniel Gane&lt;/a&gt;. Later, after a package goes missing (the unique dagger &lt;a href=\"Keening%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Keening&lt;/a&gt;), a delivery that Enthir insists was organized by Arniel, he directs the Dragonborn to the location where the courier was last seen.\n&lt;a href=\"Onmund%27s%20Request\"&gt;Onmund's Request&lt;/a&gt;.\n&lt;a href=\"Onmund\"&gt;Onmund&lt;/a&gt; requests that the Dragonborn ask Enthir to return his Amulet, and should they be unable to persuade him to do so, Enthir will offer to return the item if the Dragonborn recovers a staff (the &lt;a href=\"Grand%20Staff%20of%20Charming\"&gt;Grand Staff of Charming&lt;/a&gt;) from a radiant location. Upon the successful recovery of the staff, Enthir will return the amulet.\n&lt;a href=\"Hard%20Answers\"&gt;Hard Answers&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe Dragonborn is sent by &lt;a href=\"Karliah\"&gt;Karliah&lt;/a&gt; to speak with Enthir in order to translate Gallus's journal. Enthir identifies that the text within it was written in the &lt;a href=\"Falmer%20language\"&gt;Falmer language&lt;/a&gt;, but as he is unable to translate it, he sends the Dragonborn to &lt;a href=\"Calcelmo\"&gt;Calcelmo&lt;/a&gt;, self-defined expert on the &lt;a href=\"Dwemer\"&gt;Dwemer&lt;/a&gt; and court-mage of &lt;a href=\"Markarth%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Markarth&lt;/a&gt; to have it deciphered. After the Dragonborn collects a &lt;a href=\"Calcelmo%27s%20Stone%20Rubbing\"&gt;rubbing&lt;/a&gt; of a Falmer deciphering tool located within &lt;a href=\"Calcelmo%27s%20Tower\"&gt;Calcelmo's Tower&lt;/a&gt;, Enthir successfully translates the journal, offering his services as a &lt;a href=\"Fence%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;fence&lt;/a&gt; in return.\nServices.\nEnthir sells &lt;a href=\"Black%20Soul%20Gem%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Black Soul Gems&lt;/a&gt; for around 800\u20131,000 . He sells other mage equipment, such as &lt;a href=\"Spell%20Tomes%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;spell tomes&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Staves%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;staves&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Robes%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;robes&lt;/a&gt;, at much higher prices than other &lt;a href=\"Merchants%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;merchants&lt;/a&gt;. He also sells &lt;a href=\"Daedra%20Heart%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Daedra Hearts&lt;/a&gt;, which are useful for &lt;a href=\"Alchemy%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Alchemy&lt;/a&gt; and creating &lt;a href=\"Daedric%20Armor%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Daedric armor&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Daedric%20Weapons%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;weapons&lt;/a&gt;. He restocks his items every two days.\nAfter \"Hard Answers\" has been completed, he will sell his wares at regular prices. He will only act as a fence when outside the College's buildings or in the town of Winterhold. Be warned: if the &lt;a href=\"Last%20Dragonborn\"&gt;Dragonborn&lt;/a&gt; attacks him, the &lt;a href=\"Thieves%20Guild%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Thieves Guild&lt;/a&gt; will require a compensation.\nDialogue.\n\"Let me give you a bit of advice. You want to work on something that's not officially allowed? Don't tell anyone you're doing it. You need something you're not officially supposed to have, you come see me. You tell anyone that I told you, and I'll fry you from the inside out. Got it? Good.\"\nConversations.\nEnthir: \"\"Hmm. This is intriguing, but highly disturbing. It appears that Gallus had suspicions about Mercer Frey's allegiance to the Guild for months. Gallus had begun to uncover what he calls an \"... unduly lavish lifestyle replete with spending vast amounts of gold on personal pleasures.\"\"\"\nKarliah: \"Does the journal say where this wealth came from?\"\nEnthir: \"Yes. Gallus seems certain that Mercer had been removing funds from the Guild's treasury without anyone's knowledge.\"\nKarliah: \"Anything else, Enthir? Anything about... the Nightingales?\"\nEnthir: \"\"Hmm. Yes, here it is. The last few pages seem to describe \"the failure of the Nightingales\" although it doesn't go into great detail. Gallus also repeatedly mentions his strong belief that Mercer desecrated something known as the Twilight Sepulcher.\"\"\nKarliah: \"Shadows preserve us. So it's true...\"\nEnthir: \"I'm not familiar with the Twilight Sepulcher. What is it? What's Mercer Frey done?\"\nKarliah: \"I'm sorry Enthir, I can't say. All that matters is we deliver your translation to the Guild immediately. Farewell, Enthir... words can't express...\"\nEnthir: \"It's alright Karliah. You don't have to say a word.\""}

Eola is effective at a distance or close range and can sneak without attracting attention. When well equipped she can hold her own and is a great follower due to her versatility.\nCombat behavior.\nEola usually begins by summoning a &lt;a href=\"Flame%20Atronach%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;flame atronach&lt;/a&gt; to her aid, casting &lt;a href=\"Fireball%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Fireballs&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"Lightning%20Bolt%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Lightning&lt;/a&gt;, then re-animating the bodies of slain enemies.

It was my older brother, &lt;a href=\"Gadof\"&gt;Gadof&lt;/a&gt;, who first met the prince. Gadof had been set upon by bandits on the road to &lt;a href=\"Whiterun%20Hold\"&gt;Whiterun Hold&lt;/a&gt;, and he was outnumbered seven to one. A Stormfist through and through, Gadof made a good showing, but his hammer couldn't be everywhere at once. He had taken down two of the bandits, but he had been wounded in the process and his blood was flowing freely.\nThat's when &lt;a href=\"Fildgor%20Orcthane\"&gt;Fildgor Strong-Prince&lt;/a&gt; appeared. He leaped into the middle of the remaining bandits, scattering them with a series of powerful blows. He fought his way to Gadof's side and set his broad back against my brother's. They defeated the bandits, and Fildgor carried my brother home. Our younger brother, Braxek, rushed to help. When they learned who Fildgor was, they both pledged their lives and their honor to the strong and charismatic prince.\nI was only a girl at the time, but from the moment I saw him, I knew that I was in love with the stranger from the east. Fildgor stayed at our house, helping out while Gadof recovered from his wounds. They talked often, and that's where the idea for the Stormfist Brigade was first born. Fildgor imagined a group of boon companions, traveling the land and righting wrongs. He was so idealistic! And he talked about Queen Mabjaarn with such love and admiration.\nWhen the group of twelve finally came together, drawn from the strongest and bravest of the Stormfist clan, a great feast was thrown to send them off in style. The party lasted for three days, and on the morning of the forth day, the Stormfist Brigade rode out. Determined to be a part of that special group, I took up my hammer and followed them. When they were in the thick of their first battle, pitted against a Goblin raiding party, I jumped in to help. Just as Fildgor Strong-Prince had done when my brother needed him.\nIt was a wonderful battle and a grand victory! The first of many for the Brigade. But my brothers were furious with me. They said I was too young to be on the road with them. Fildgor, however, simply smiled. \"She fought well,\" he said. \"And she loves me. What other requirement is there for membership in our band? Besides, thirteen is a much better number than twelve.\"\nI stayed at Fildgor's side through the battles of the &lt;a href=\"Akaviri\"&gt;Akaviri&lt;/a&gt; war. I was there to comfort him when he lost the throne to his &lt;a href=\"Skeever%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Skeever&lt;/a&gt; of a brother, &lt;a href=\"Jorunn\"&gt;Jorunn&lt;/a&gt;. And I followed him into exile, where I watched him build an army out of thin air and rally the &lt;a href=\"Orsimer%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Orcs&lt;/a&gt; of the far reaches. Now we're back, and this time I'll be there to watch my beloved Fildgor finally claim the throne that is rightfully his. Even if it does mean hiding in caves until the time is right to make our move.\nAnd as far as caves go, &lt;a href=\"Old%20Sord%27s%20Cave\"&gt;this one&lt;/a&gt; isn't half bad."}

If the Stormcloaks capture Whiterun, Eorlund's brother, &lt;a href=\"Vignar%20Gray-Mane\"&gt;Vignar Gray-Mane&lt;/a&gt;, becomes &lt;a href=\"Jarl\"&gt;Jarl&lt;/a&gt;. Eorlund's children are &lt;a href=\"Avulstein%20Gray-Mane\"&gt;Avulstein&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Thorald%20Gray-Mane\"&gt;Thorald&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Olfina%20Gray-Mane\"&gt;Olfina&lt;/a&gt;.\nEorlund is &lt;a href=\"Marriage%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;married&lt;/a&gt; to &lt;a href=\"Fralia%20Gray-Mane\"&gt;Fralia Gray-Mane&lt;/a&gt;, who can be found at her market stall in the Plains District of &lt;a href=\"Whiterun%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Whiterun&lt;/a&gt; selling any &lt;a href=\"Jewelry%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;jewelry&lt;/a&gt; Eorlund crafts. According to Fralia, the only topic Eorlund will talk about is the &lt;a href=\"Skyforge%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Skyforge&lt;/a&gt;, though she mentions that the Dragonborn might be able to get him to talk about \"those dung-sniffing Battle-Borns.\"\nInteractions.\nSkyforge Steel.\nAfter passing the trial and joining The Companions, Eorlund crafts a special &lt;a href=\"Skyforge%20Steel\"&gt;Skyforge weapon&lt;/a&gt; of the Dragonborn's choice.\nTraining.\nHe is the master &lt;a href=\"Trainers%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;trainer&lt;/a&gt; of Smithing in the base game, and can train up to level 90. The Dragonborn must complete the first \"&lt;a href=\"Take%20Up%20Arms\"&gt;Take Up Arms&lt;/a&gt;\" quest for the Companions to receive training.\nCompanions Main Questline.\n&lt;a href=\"Take%20Up%20Arms\"&gt;Take Up Arms&lt;/a&gt;.\nAfter Vilkas tests the Dragonborn's arm in the training area behind &lt;a href=\"Jorrvaskr\"&gt;Jorrvaskr&lt;/a&gt;, he sends\u00a0the Dragonborn to Eorlund Gray-Mane in the &lt;a href=\"Skyforge%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Skyforge&lt;/a&gt;\u00a0to get his sword sharpened. Eorlund mentions that his wife is in grieving (probably a reference to his missing son Thorald; see &lt;a href=\"Missing%20in%20Action\"&gt;Missing in Action&lt;/a&gt;) and that he needs to get back to her, he asks a favor of the Dragonborn: to bring Aela back her shield. Completion of this task makes the Dragonborn part of the Jorrvaskr faction, and enables Eorlund Gray-Mane as a trainer.\n&lt;a href=\"Purity%20of%20Revenge\"&gt;Purity of Revenge&lt;/a&gt;.\nEorlund informs the Dragonborn that the Skyforge has become \"young\" once again. This specifically alludes to the option to craft &lt;a href=\"Nord%20Hero%20Weapons\"&gt;Nord Hero Weapons&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Ancient%20Nord%20Armor\"&gt;Ancient Nord Armor&lt;/a&gt; at the Skyforge.\n&lt;a href=\"Glory%20of%20the%20Dead\"&gt;Glory of the Dead&lt;/a&gt;.\nAfter Kodlak's funeral, Eorlund\u00a0will ask the Dragonborn to give him the collected fragments of\u00a0&lt;a href=\"Wuuthrad%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Wuuthrad&lt;/a&gt;\u00a0so he can prepare them for mounting. Then, after tasking the Dragonborn with retrieving the final piece of Wuuthrad in Kodlak's personal chambers, Eorlund will thank the Dragonborn and tell him/her that the Circle is waiting for them in &lt;a href=\"The%20Underforge\"&gt;The Underforge&lt;/a&gt;.\u00a0After the\u00a0conversation in\u00a0the Underforge, Eorlund will appear with Wuuthrad, fully reforged, which he passes to the player.\nDialogue.\nIntroduction.\n\"Got a lot of steel to shape.\"\n\"What brings you here?\"\n\"Wait, before you go...

And he didn't get it. It's as simple as that.\"\nAela: \"Being moon-born is not so much of a curse as you might think, Vilkas.\"\nVilkas: \"That's fine for you. But he wanted to be clean. He wanted to meet Ysgramor and know the glories of Sovngarde. But all that was taken from him.\"\nAela: \"And you avenged him.\"\nFarkas: \"Kodlak did not care for vengeance.\"\nVilkas: \"No, Farkas, he didn't. And that's not what this is about. We should be honoring Kodlak, no matter our own thoughts on the blood.\"\nAela: \"You're right. It's what he wanted, and he deserved to have it.\"\nVilkas: \"Kodlak used to speak of a way to cleanse his soul, even in death. You know the legends of the Tomb of Ysgramor.\"\nAela: \"There the souls of Harbingers will heed the call of northern steel. We can't even enter the tomb without Wuuthrad, and it's in pieces, like it has been for a thousand years.\"\nEorlund: \"And dragons were just stories. And the elves once ruled Skyrim. Just because something is, doesn't mean it must be. The blade is a weapon. A tool. Tools are meant to be broken. And repaired.\"\nVilkas: \"Is that? Did you repair the blade?\"\nEorlund: \"\"This is the first time I've had all the pieces, thanks to our Shield-Brother here. \"The flames of a hero can reforge the shattered.\" The flames of Kodlak shall fuel the rebirth of Wuuthrad. And now it will take you to meet him once more. As the one who bore the fragments, I think should be the one to carry Wuuthrad into battle. The rest of you, prepare to journey to the Tomb of Ysgramor. For Kodlak.\"\"\nFralia Gray-Mane.\nFralia: \"Eorlund, dearest, are you hungry?

The regional deity is &lt;a href=\"Mara\"&gt;Mara&lt;/a&gt;.\nDescription.\nGeography.\nThe city of Ephesus is located on the southern edge of the &lt;a href=\"March%20of%20Ephesus\"&gt;March of Ephesus&lt;/a&gt;, which is a landlocked March surrounded by the unclaimed territories of the &lt;a href=\"Dragontail%20Mountains\"&gt;Dragontail Mountains&lt;/a&gt;, being one the most isolated nations of the Iliac Bay. The region of Ephesus is located on the southernmost end of the &lt;a href=\"Bangkorai\"&gt;Bangkorai&lt;/a&gt; region, from the High Rock side. Ephesus is closer to &lt;a href=\"the%20Reach\"&gt;the Reach&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"Skyrim\"&gt;Skyrim&lt;/a&gt; and even the &lt;a href=\"Craglorn\"&gt;Craglorn&lt;/a&gt; region of &lt;a href=\"Hammerfell\"&gt;Hammerfell&lt;/a&gt;. North of Ephesus is &lt;a href=\"Mournoth\"&gt;Mournoth&lt;/a&gt;, while south of Ephesus is the &lt;a href=\"Fallen%20Wastes\"&gt;Fallen Wastes&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href=\"Lake%20Viridian\"&gt;Lake Viridian&lt;/a&gt; is a large lake located on eastern Ephesus and is one of the biggest landmarks of the region, including the famous &lt;a href=\"Bangkorai%20Garrison\"&gt;Bangkorai Garrison&lt;/a&gt;, the large bulwark separating the Ephesus grasslands from the Hammerfell wastes. Ephesus is the least populated area in Bangkorai, not including the Garrison.\nHistory.\n&lt;a href=\"Second%20Era\"&gt;Second Era&lt;/a&gt;.\nDuring the &lt;a href=\"Alliance%20War\"&gt;Alliance War&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"2E%20582\"&gt;2E 582&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"Seventh%20Legion\"&gt;Seventh Legion&lt;/a&gt; under &lt;a href=\"Septima%20Tharn\"&gt;Septima Tharn&lt;/a&gt; had planned a conquest over the &lt;a href=\"Bangkorai\"&gt;Bangkorai&lt;/a&gt; region and failed in an attempt to take the city of &lt;a href=\"Evermore\"&gt;Evermore&lt;/a&gt;. With the &lt;a href=\"Daggerfall%20Covenant\"&gt;Daggerfall Covenant&lt;/a&gt; on high alert, the Seventh Legion prepared for conflict, and after meeting &lt;a href=\"High%20King%20Emeric\"&gt;High King Emeric&lt;/a&gt; at the &lt;a href=\"Nchu%20Duabthar%20Threshold\"&gt;Nchu Duabthar Threshold&lt;/a&gt;, a war occurred between the Seventh Legion and the Covenant. The Legion had taken the Bangkorai Garrison with her battlemage, &lt;a href=\"Battlemage%20Papus\"&gt;Papus&lt;/a&gt; orchestrating the battle. The Covenant's prized agent known as the &lt;a href=\"Vestige\"&gt;Vestige&lt;/a&gt;, infiltrated the Garrison through the sewers and taken out Papus from within. The Legion had created a &lt;a href=\"Dark%20Anchor\"&gt;Dark Anchor&lt;/a&gt; in the middle of the Garrison, unleashing a Daedric Army into the Garrison, holding the Covenant from the northern gate. The Vestige defeated Papus and &lt;a href=\"Xivilai%20Moath\"&gt;Xivilai Moath&lt;/a&gt; at the Dolmen and saved the Garrison, securing it for the Covenant. Afterwards, the Covenant advanced into the &lt;a href=\"Fallen%20Wastes\"&gt;Fallen Wastes&lt;/a&gt; to defeat Septima Tharn and to secure the city of &lt;a href=\"Hallin%27s%20Stand\"&gt;Hallin's Stand&lt;/a&gt;.\n&lt;a href=\"Third%20Era\"&gt;Third Era&lt;/a&gt;.\nDuring the &lt;a href=\"Warp%20in%20the%20West\"&gt;Warp in the West&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"3E%20405\"&gt;3E 405&lt;/a&gt;, the March of Ephesus was under the reign of an unknown Marquis, whose name was not recorded in the history books. Ephesus existed among the twenty-three other nations of the &lt;a href=\"Iliac%20Bay\"&gt;Iliac Bay&lt;/a&gt;. Ephesus, itself is in a mainland march that is far from the nearest kingdom, that being Orsinium, one of the three great kingdoms of the &lt;a href=\"Iliac%20Bay\"&gt;Iliac Bay&lt;/a&gt;. Later in the same year, the Warp in the West resulted in the Kingdoms expanding their territories, absorbing the smaller nations. The March of Ephesus was annexed into the Kingdom of Orsinium along with other regions on the northern coast of the Iliac."}

Ephrem, who was still loyal to the Longhouse Emperors, decided to seize this opportunity and sent forces of Anvil to capture Varen's holdings and take control of Kvatch. Carolus rallied the &lt;a href=\"Kvatch%20Warders\"&gt;Kvatch Warders&lt;/a&gt; and the part of the Second Legion he commanded, commanding them at the plains below the city.

After word had reached that Varen seized the &lt;a href=\"Ruby%20Throne\"&gt;Ruby Throne&lt;/a&gt; and killed Leovic, Carolus officially inherited the title of count. With Anvil's forces severely weakened, the city was left vulnerable.

Within a day, Ephrem lost his title as count of Anvil and was succeeded by Fortunata.\nAfter his defeat at the hands of the Pirate Queen, Fortunata ordered ivory cameos of Ephrem to be destroyed. Some tax collectors were still charging those who embarked on the docks one-tenth of all gold exchanged, and were ordered by &lt;a href=\"Dockmaster%20Qamar\"&gt;Dockmaster Qamar&lt;/a&gt; to increase it to Fortunata's one-fifth rate."}

Paarthurnax sits atop the Throat's &lt;a href=\"Word%20Walls%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Word Wall&lt;/a&gt;, greeting the Dragonborn with grief.\n\"So, it is done. . The Eldest is no more, he who came before all others, and has always been.\"\n\"Perhaps now you have some insight into the forces that shape the vennesetiid... the currents of Time. Perhaps you begin to see the world as a dovah. But I forget myself. . . Melancholy is an easy trap for a dovah to fall into. You have won a mighty victory. - one that will echo through all the ages of this world for those who have eyes to see. Savor your triumph, Dovahkiin. This is not the last of what you will write upon the currents of Time.\"\nThe conversation ends as Paarthurnax leaps off the wall and ascends to the skies.\nPaarthurnax: \"Goraan! I feel younger than I have in many an age. Many of the are now scattered across . Without Alduin's lordship, they may yet bow to the ... rightness of my Thu'um.\"\nPaarthurnax pauses in mid-air, and will face the Dragonborn.\nPaarthurnax: But willing or no, they will hear it! Fare thee well, Dovahkiin!\"\"\nPaarthurnax, along with the other dragons, continues to circle around the Throat of the World. Eventually, he and the other dragons leave one by one. Next, &lt;a href=\"Odahviing%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Odahviing&lt;/a&gt; lands, greeting the Dragonborn.\nOdahviing: \"\". I wish the old one luck in his... quest. But I doubt many will wish to exchange Alduin's lordship for the tyranny of Paarthurnax's \"Way of the Voice\". As for myself, you've proven your mastery twice over. . I gladly acknowledge the power of your Thu'um. . Call me when you have need, and I will come if I can.\"\"\nOdahviing then ascends high into the sky, and circles the Throat of the World alone. This marks the end of the main questline.\nReturn to High Hrothgar.\nIf the Dragonborn returns to &lt;a href=\"High%20Hrothgar%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;High Hrothgar&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"the%20Greybeards\"&gt;the Greybeards&lt;/a&gt; will all be gathered at the conference table waiting for them. &lt;a href=\"Arngeir\"&gt;Arngeir&lt;/a&gt; will rise and address the Dragonborn.\n\"I can see it in your eyes. You've seen the land of the Gods and returned.\"\nUpon completion of this passage, if the Dragonborn speaks to Arngeir again, there will be a new dialogue option.\nIs Alduin really dead? I didn't absorb his soul when he died. \"Perhaps, perhaps not. Dragons are not like normal mortal creatures, and Alduin is unique even among dragonkind. He may be permitted to return at the end of time to fulfill his destiny as the World-Eater. But that is for the gods to decide. You have done your part.\"\nIf Paarthurnax was killed, it is possible the Greybeards will be inhospitable and will not speak to the Dragonborn.\nThe Blades.\nRegardless of whether Paarthurnax has been killed or not, the Dragonborn can return to the Blades, where Esbern tells them Delphine has been worried about them since the rumors that they flew out of Whiterun on a dragon. The two are happy to hear that Alduin is dead and that the Dragonborn's destiny has been fulfilled. If the Dragonborn speaks to Delphine she will have the following to say.\n\"We heard the news from Whiterun - that you left the city on the back of a dragon! That's a little... showy, even for you. Since you're still alive, I assume you have good news to report?\"\nIf Paarthurnax has not been killed, the two insist they are not ungrateful for all that has been done, but repeat that they must stay true to their oath as Blades, and so cannot aid the Dragonborn further until they kill Paarthurnax and close the pages on a dark chapter in history with the death of both brothers.\nAlterations.\nKilling Paarthurnax.\nIf Paarthurnax is killed before &lt;a href=\"Dragonslayer\"&gt;Dragonslayer&lt;/a&gt; is completed, the epilogue's script will not appear in-game. Upon returning to the Throat of the World, several dragons will fly overhead but Paarthurnax will not be there.\nCalling Odahviing.\nIf the shout \"&lt;a href=\"Call%20Dragon%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Call Dragon&lt;/a&gt;\" is used, and Odahviing is summoned, talking to him will result in him admitting that he is no longer ashamed of his defeat, as not even &lt;a href=\"Alduin%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Alduin&lt;/a&gt; himself could stand against the Dragonborn's Thu'um, and that Alduin's lordship has been passed to the Dovahkiin."}

Let its sweetest truth rest upon Thava-ko's tongue.\nHear Thava-ko's voice, children of the &lt;a href=\"Two-Moons%20Dance\"&gt;Two-Moons Dance&lt;/a&gt;. Word reaches us in the &lt;a href=\"Torval%20Curiata\"&gt;Torval Curiata&lt;/a&gt; that an ancient book\u2014a pre-ri'Datta catalog of &lt;a href=\"Et%27Ada\"&gt;spirits&lt;/a&gt;, assembled by an ancient priest named &lt;a href=\"Amun-dro\"&gt;Amun-dro&lt;/a&gt;\u2014has captured the imaginations of &lt;a href=\"Khajiit%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Khajiit&lt;/a&gt; throughout &lt;a href=\"Pellitine\"&gt;Pellitine&lt;/a&gt;. Our people seem taken with its colorful and otherworldly descriptions of powerful spirits, both good and evil. Adepts from far and wide have come to Thava-ko with curious hearts and twitching tails, asking why they were not taught these old scriptures. We Khajiit are a curious and playful people, but some subjects carry great risk. We cannot, in good conscience, allow this heretical document to fester in the minds of light-minded ja'Khajiit. For that reason, Thava-ko and her fellow priests publish this refutation. Spread this far and wide, faithful litter of &lt;a href=\"Rid-Thar-ri%27Datta\"&gt;Rid-Thar-ri'Datta&lt;/a&gt;.\nIn the dark times before the &lt;a href=\"First%20Mane\"&gt;First Mane&lt;/a&gt;'s revelation, our forebears held scattered beliefs\u2014sixteen faiths that tumbled and scratched their way through history, competing for the &lt;a href=\"souls\"&gt;souls&lt;/a&gt; of all Khajiit. This spiritual chaos led us down many paths, all of which carried great risk. You need only look upon our bent kin, the &lt;a href=\"dro-m%27Athra\"&gt;dro-m'Athra&lt;/a&gt;, to find the proof of these perils. This book of profanities is the product of those dark times. Shall we return to the era of sixteen wars, and hunter-fiefs, and pitiless famine? No, and no, and no again! In the truth of Riddle'Thar, we find more than spiritual fulfillment. We find a rock to build upon\u2014an end to the shifting sands of old. We find a better path through peace and order.\nThis old text carries greater danger because it hides its blasphemies under a shroud of truth. Many of its attestations walk paw-in-paw with Riddle'Thar, such as its praise for the Moons, and its deference to the blessed spirits: &lt;a href=\"Khenarthi\"&gt;Khenarthi&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"S%27rendarr\"&gt;S'rendarr&lt;/a&gt;, and others. But its darker fables lay hidden like snares. Take, for instance, its account of the Moon Beast, &lt;a href=\"Lorkhaj\"&gt;Lorkhaj&lt;/a&gt;.\nWho knows noisy Lorkhaj's darkness better than the Khajiit? We all suffer the call to the Dark at some point in our lives. Who among us has not heard the beating drum of the Dark Heart in our moments of deepest sorrow or most anguished regret? To lift up the first dro-m'Athra as a hero of our people defies both faith and reason. How many adepts shall fall to &lt;a href=\"Namiira\"&gt;Namiira&lt;/a&gt; on account of this document? How many ja'khajiit will call on the Moon Beast, intent on reviving his true spirit, only to be swallowed by his eternal curse? Any thief can tell you that the surest path to a victim's purse starts with a smile. A smiling Lorkhaj is too dangerous to contemplate."}

Let its sweetest truth rest upon Thava-ko's tongue.\nOne of our people's greatest strengths lies in our flexibility. We do not jail free-thinkers as &lt;a href=\"Dunmer%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Dark Elves&lt;/a&gt; do. We do not decry &lt;a href=\"Green%20Pact\"&gt;salads as a blasphemy&lt;/a&gt; like the &lt;a href=\"Bosmer%20%28Online%29\"&gt;stubby acorn-worshipers&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"Valenwood%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Valenwood&lt;/a&gt;. We do not pledge our souls only to &lt;a href=\"Eight%20Divines\"&gt;eight dusty myths&lt;/a&gt; like the &lt;a href=\"Imperials%20%28Online%29\"&gt;furless litters&lt;/a&gt; of long-dead &lt;a href=\"Alessia\"&gt;Alessia&lt;/a&gt;. To be a &lt;a href=\"Khajiit%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Khajiit&lt;/a&gt; is to be free\u2014free of cruel dogma, and free of bitter self-denial. Riddle'Thar does not kneel and mumble, it dances and sings! Ours is a faith rooted in joy, and faithful indulgence, and grinning charity. Alas, this strength often slides into shrugging disregard. We let our claws slip from the truth and wonder if \"truth\" even matters. Worship and transaction fall into eclipse. Well-earned relaxation gives way to a kitten's indolence. Our spirits grow poor. And a spirit so afflicted makes itself the perfect prey for the &lt;a href=\"dro-m%27Athra\"&gt;dro-m'Athra&lt;/a&gt;.\nAmun-dro's catalogue of spirits preys on the worst aspects of our carefree natures. Take the inclusion of &lt;a href=\"Mafala\"&gt;Mafala&lt;/a&gt;, the Eight-Clawed. Were the bloody horrors of the Sinner Suicides not proof enough of her dark nature? Consider also the Tide-King, &lt;a href=\"Hermorah\"&gt;Hermorah&lt;/a&gt;. This document would have us believe that &lt;a href=\"Azurah\"&gt;Azurah&lt;/a&gt; walks the dampened halls of his &lt;a href=\"Apocrypha\"&gt;dark library&lt;/a&gt; as friend. If our distant mother does this, should we not do the same? No! For Khajiit who call on Hermorah's counsel risk a fate worse than death. Mumbles from the sea will tear a mind asunder as surely as the most potent &lt;a href=\"skooma\"&gt;skooma&lt;/a&gt;. His briny \"truths\" shred our sense of reality and set us adrift\u2014far from &lt;a href=\"ja-Kha%27jay\"&gt;ja-Kha'jay&lt;/a&gt;.\nWe must also consider who this catalog of spirits excludes. These books offer the rosiest descriptions of malevolent beings, but what of loving &lt;a href=\"Mara\"&gt;Mara&lt;/a&gt; and noble &lt;a href=\"S%27rendarr\"&gt;S'rendarr&lt;/a&gt;? This ancient zealot, Amun-dro, fails even to mention their names. And why? Because his aged theology offers no refuge for simple virtues like charity, humility, and love. Our beloved &lt;a href=\"Rid-Thar-ri%27Datta\"&gt;Rid-Thar-ri'Datta&lt;/a&gt; offered us more than Clan Mother tales\u2014he offered us grace. In a world so crowded by great spirits and grand cosmic plans, where does the simple Khajiit rest his weary paws? The &lt;a href=\"Two-Moons%20Dance\"&gt;Two-Moons Dance&lt;/a&gt; speaks plainly. It has no need for ancient conflicts\u2014only simple precepts that lead to a life well-lived. In the end, a joyful life is the greatest gift of the Riddle'Thar."}

This comes as no surprise. In truth, the &lt;a href=\"First%20Mane\"&gt;First Mane&lt;/a&gt;'s epiphany had little to do with the aged stories of kingdoms past. Before Riddle'Thar, priests and adepts busied themselves deciphering the arcane ramblings of ancient prophets\u2014gleaning precious little from vast and crumbling archives. How like pearl divers they were! Prying open countless ugly shells in the vain hope of finding some tiny treasure within.\nYou must ask yourselves, what profits a &lt;a href=\"Khajiit%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Khajiit&lt;/a&gt; to puzzle over such a text? You who wield the scythe. You who drive the wagons. You who work the forge. Do these tales of cosmic import bring you solace in your darkest moments? When you turn to thievery to feed a sick child, or watch your father whip your brother for a sin you committed, or struggle under the heel of a foreign oppressor, what guidance can you find in these old myths? They speak of \"paths\" and \"laws,\" but Amun-dro's path is little more than this: obedience. Slavish devotion to our distant mother, &lt;a href=\"Azurah\"&gt;Azurah&lt;/a&gt;. Deference and respect for &lt;a href=\"Daedric%20Princes\"&gt;darkest spirits&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"Oblivion%20%28Realm%29\"&gt;Oblivion&lt;/a&gt;. Tangled, contradictory virtues that threaten to send one tumbling whisker-first into the gaping maw of &lt;a href=\"Lorkhaj\"&gt;Lorkhaj&lt;/a&gt;. Amun-dro's world is a world of woe\u2014a swirling gyre of fate and darkness where the Khajiit have no voice beyond hymns of worship or screams of terror.\nWhat of &lt;a href=\"Llesw%27er\"&gt;Llesw'er&lt;/a&gt;? What of joy, and good food, and honest labor? Riddle'Thar, as described by our blessed , offers a true path. Better yet, it is a path you already know. The &lt;a href=\"Two-Moons%20Dance\"&gt;Two-Moons Dance&lt;/a&gt; whirls and reels in your heart, just as it always has since the moment of your birth. You needn't look to the distant past. Look to the now, and the road ahead\u2014tread clean by the paws of faithful pilgrims. &lt;a href=\"Nirni\"&gt;Nirni&lt;/a&gt;'s bounty and the Sands of paradise are your birthright, Moon-child. Cast aside Amun-dro's morbid tales and live a joyful life worthy of the Sugar God!"}

After the day Anna\u00efg supposedly stole the savor, Phmer and her assistants went to &lt;a href=\"Toel\"&gt;Toel&lt;/a&gt;'s kitchen to accuse her. &lt;a href=\"Intovar\"&gt;Intovar&lt;/a&gt; and Yeum were present when Anna\u00efg entered Toel's balcony. Phmer used an insect-like creature to detect the ninth savor's scent, but instead of pointing at Anna\u00efg, he flew to &lt;a href=\"Slyr\"&gt;Slyr&lt;/a&gt;'s dress. &lt;a href=\"Anna%C3%AFg\"&gt;Anna\u00efg&lt;/a&gt; had synthesized the ninth savor on her own, and she had hidden a vial filled with it in Slyr's dress. Everyone blamed Slyr, and Phmer took possession of her.\nAfter Toel's death, &lt;a href=\"Lord%20Irrel\"&gt;Lord Irrel&lt;/a&gt; met Intovar and Yeum to discuss their possibilities to win &lt;a href=\"Lord%20Rhel\"&gt;Lord Rhel&lt;/a&gt;'s contest. As Toel's second in command, Intovar answered Lord Rhel's question,\nbut he killed Intovar for not giving a straight answer. Yeum told Irrel that they couldn't win the contest without Toel. However, Anna\u00efg stepped forward and told Lord Irrel that they could win. After Irrel was gone, Yeum accused Anna\u00efg of sentencing them to death. Anna\u00efg told her that if they followed her orders, they would win, and she would be named the new chef of the kitchen. Yeum protested arguing she was the most senior cook, but she finally agreed to follow her lead.\nYeum advised Anna\u00efg to delegate duties on other cookers. She was a good chef, but she couldn't do it all by herself. Yeum proposed Anna\u00efg to help her with her task in exchange of keeping her as her underchef. She also asked Anna\u00efg if she had killed Toel, but Anna\u00efg didn't admit it had been her. Yeum revealed that she would have nothing but her admiration if she had done so. After winning the contest, Yeum followed working for Anna\u00efg. She helped her prepare the meal for &lt;a href=\"Lord%20Umbriel\"&gt;Lord Umbriel&lt;/a&gt;. Yeum informed Anna\u00efg that &lt;a href=\"Fhena\"&gt;Fhena&lt;/a&gt; had sneaked into the kitchens with a knife to kill her.\nWhen Anna\u00efg poisoned the trees of &lt;a href=\"Umbriel\"&gt;Umbriel&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Mere-Glim\"&gt;Mere-Glim&lt;/a&gt; entered Anna\u00efg's kitchen to ask her to stop the poison. Yeum and other armed cookers tried to stop him, but Anna\u00efg threw a vial that poured a yellow gas that made Yeum and the other cookers collapse."}

Ylgar, as well as his brother and father, sailed to &lt;a href=\"Tamriel\"&gt;Tamriel&lt;/a&gt; fleeing civil war on &lt;a href=\"Atmora\"&gt;Atmora&lt;/a&gt;.

Ylgar, along with Ysgramor and his brother, fled back to Atmora. They are said to be the only survivors.\nReturn.\nYlgar was renowned in Atmora as a warrior possessing an unwavering spirit that drove his singular prowess to overwhelming feats in war.\nYlgar sought to avenge to his fallen brothers and sisters\u00a0and joined the &lt;a href=\"Five%20Hundred%20Companions\"&gt;Five Hundred Companions&lt;/a&gt;, led by his father. He commissioned two ships for himself and his brother and became the &lt;a href=\"Captain%20%28Lore%29\"&gt;captain&lt;/a&gt; of \"&lt;a href=\"Darumzu\"&gt;Darumzu&lt;/a&gt;\". Yngol and Ylgar sailed out of the massive shipyards of &lt;a href=\"Jylkurfyk\"&gt;Jylkurfyk&lt;/a&gt;, not knowing that this was the last time they would meet.\nDuring the voyage to Tamriel, the fleet of the Five Hundred was hit by the &lt;a href=\"Storm%20of%20Separation\"&gt;Storm of Separation&lt;/a&gt;. Both of the brothers were separated from the rest of the crew. It was Ylgar and his crew who luckily avoided the hazards of the great storm and sailed out alive.\nYlgar led a crew consisting of the wise war-teacher &lt;a href=\"Adrimk\"&gt;Adrimk&lt;/a&gt;\u00a0and her students, most of whom hadn't earned their names yet. Few records are found on what happened with Ylgar and his crew after they landed on the Hsaarik Head, but it is known that he fought alongside his father during the war over Skyrim.\u00a0Judging on how the bloodline still lives on, it can be said that Ylgar survived the war with his father and ruled Skyrim after his father's death. The only other thing known about Ylgar was that he\u00a0was \"extremely handsome\", and his skill with a blade was unmatched by any of Tamriel's warriors. He also assisted his father in defeating the &lt;a href=\"giant\"&gt;giant&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Sinmur\"&gt;Sinmur&lt;/a&gt;."}

His body is found at the crypt of &lt;a href=\"Yngol%20Barrow\"&gt;Yngol Barrow&lt;/a&gt;, which is named after him.\nBackground.\nFamily and early life.\nYngol was the eldest son of the legendary &lt;a href=\"Ysgramor\"&gt;Ysgramor&lt;/a&gt;, and also had a younger brother, &lt;a href=\"Ylgar\"&gt;Ylgar&lt;/a&gt;. Yngol and Ylgar were said to have been part of Ysgramor's army, which conquered Tamriel as he tried to flee from the civil war on &lt;a href=\"Atmora\"&gt;Atmora&lt;/a&gt;.\nAlong with other settlers, Yngol and his family were inhabitants of &lt;a href=\"Saarthal\"&gt;Saarthal&lt;/a&gt; until the &lt;a href=\"Night%20of%20Tears\"&gt;Night of Tears&lt;/a&gt;, as the sacking of the city by &lt;a href=\"Snow%20Elves\"&gt;Snow Elves&lt;/a&gt; was later known. Yngol is said to be among the three survivors. He, along with Ysgramor and Ylgar, fled back to Atmora. Yngol was also a skilled weapon smith, having forged the famous Axe &lt;a href=\"Wuuthrad\"&gt;Wuuthrad&lt;/a&gt;.\nReturn.\nAfter returning to Atmora, Yngol was already known as a bold strategist, his knowledge of war so complete that his enemies were often defeated before they realized the battle had begun.\nYngol joined his father's cause to avenge the fallen brothers and sisters and joined the &lt;a href=\"Five%20Hundred%20Companions\"&gt;Five Hundred Companions&lt;/a&gt;. Ysgramor made sure both brothers had ships under their command, and thus Yngol became the &lt;a href=\"Captain%20%28Lore%29\"&gt;captain&lt;/a&gt; of \"&lt;a href=\"Harakk\"&gt;Harakk&lt;/a&gt;\". Along with everyone else, Yngol and Ylgar sailed out of the massive shipyards of &lt;a href=\"Jylkurfyk\"&gt;Jylkurfyk&lt;/a&gt;, not knowing that this was the last time they would meet.\nDeath.\nDuring the voyage to Mereth, the fleet of the Five Hundred was hit by the &lt;a href=\"Storm%20of%20Separation\"&gt;Storm of Separation&lt;/a&gt;. Both of the brothers were separated from the rest of the crew but only the youngest brother, Ylgar, sailed out of it alive. Yngol never landed at &lt;a href=\"Hsaarik%20Head\"&gt;Hsaarik Head&lt;/a&gt; along with the rest of the fleet.\nYsgramor was said to be enraged by this event. He shouted at the sea, demanding for them to return his son to him. Ysgramor set sail into the storm alone, but failed to save Yngol. By the time Ysgramor found the shipwreck of \"Harakk\", Yngol and his crewmen had already been slain by the &lt;a href=\"Sea-Ghost\"&gt;sea-ghosts&lt;/a&gt;. Yngol was first among the many brothers to fall during &lt;a href=\"the%20Return\"&gt;the Return&lt;/a&gt;.\nYsgramor is said to have hunted the beasts down and burned their corpses in honor of his fallen son. Yngol was buried in Atmoran fashion, where &lt;a href=\"Yngol%20Barrow\"&gt;a barrow&lt;/a&gt; was made for him.\nAfter reclaiming Saarthal, Ysgramor returned to Yngol's barrow and built the great city \u2013 &lt;a href=\"Windhelm\"&gt;Windhelm&lt;/a&gt;. It was built where the nearby river met the sea, close enough so that Ysgramor may see his son's resting place from the high towers of the palace.\nFourth Era.\nYngol Barrow still stood in &lt;a href=\"Fourth%20Era\"&gt;Fourth Era&lt;/a&gt; during the year &lt;a href=\"4E%20201\"&gt;201&lt;/a&gt;. Upon entering the throne room of the Yngol Barrow, the &lt;a href=\"Last%20Dragonborn\"&gt;Last Dragonborn&lt;/a&gt; is attacked by the ghost of Yngol. Yngol's corpse is wearing the &lt;a href=\"Helm%20of%20Yngol\"&gt;Helm of Yngol&lt;/a&gt;."}

He awakens upon entering the throne room, where he is guarding &lt;a href=\"Helm%20of%20Yngol\"&gt;his helmet&lt;/a&gt;.\nUnlike other &lt;a href=\"Nordic%20Tombs\"&gt;Nordic Tombs&lt;/a&gt;, where the Draugr within are matched to the player character's level, Yngol's Shade is always much more powerful than the player's current level. For example, if the player enters the Barrow at level 22, Yngol's Shade will already be a &lt;a href=\"Draugr%20Death%20Overlord\"&gt;Draugr Death Overlord&lt;/a&gt;, even though such Draugr normally appear when the player is level 40+.\nAt higher levels, Yngol's Shade appears as a &lt;a href=\"Spectral%20Dragon%20Priest\"&gt;spectral&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Dragon%20Priests%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Dragon Priest&lt;/a&gt;.\nCombat.\nYngol's Shade will use the &lt;a href=\"Frost%20Breath\"&gt;Frost Breath&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Disarm\"&gt;Disarm&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Unrelenting%20Force%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Unrelenting Force&lt;/a&gt; shouts to impede the Dragonborn's movement if in a standard Draugr form, then attack directly with his leveled weapon. At higher levels, this can be an Ebony &lt;a href=\"Ebony%20sword\"&gt;sword&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Ebony%20War%20Axe%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;war axe&lt;/a&gt;, or &lt;a href=\"Ebony%20Battleaxe%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;battleaxe&lt;/a&gt;. If Yngol's Shade has appeared as a Dragon Priest, he will instead use magic against the player and any &lt;a href=\"Followers%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;followers&lt;/a&gt;, such as &lt;a href=\"Fireball%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Fireball&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Thunderbolt\"&gt;Thunderbolt&lt;/a&gt;, and can conjure a &lt;a href=\"Storm%20Atronach%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Storm Atronach&lt;/a&gt; to help him.\nDue to his spectral appearance, and the bright greenish light in the room, it can be hard to see him, so the &lt;a href=\"Detect%20Dead\"&gt;Detect Dead&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Alteration%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Alteration&lt;/a&gt; spell or the &lt;a href=\"Aura%20Whisper\"&gt;Aura Whisper&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"dragon%20shout\"&gt;dragon shout&lt;/a&gt; should be used to see him better. As with all &lt;a href=\"Undead%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;undead&lt;/a&gt;, Yngol's Shade is weak to &lt;a href=\"Fire%20Damage%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;fire&lt;/a&gt;, so fire-enchanted weapons, fire spells, and the &lt;a href=\"Fire%20Breath%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Fire Breath&lt;/a&gt; shout can be used to great effect against him. Since his weaponry (if in Draugr form) can deal excessive damage, it is best to deal with him from afar via &lt;a href=\"Archery%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;a bow and arrows&lt;/a&gt; or spellcraft. If needing a respite, or time to run and heal, the Alteration spell &lt;a href=\"Paralyze%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Paralyze&lt;/a&gt; or the &lt;a href=\"Ice%20Form\"&gt;Ice Form&lt;/a&gt; shout can stop him from fighting long enough to deal with any injuries received in the fight."}

It contains &lt;a href=\"Draugr%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;draugr&lt;/a&gt; and adept-level &lt;a href=\"Containers%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;chests&lt;/a&gt;.\nInterior.\nThe area contains a puzzle door that requires the &lt;a href=\"coral%20dragon%20claw\"&gt;coral dragon claw&lt;/a&gt; to open, which can be found either from &lt;a href=\"Birna\"&gt;Birna&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Winterhold%20%28Skyrim%20City%29\"&gt;Winterhold&lt;/a&gt; at her general goods store next to the Jarl's Longhouse, or within the barrow itself, located on a pedestal past a puzzle room. If one obtains the quest to retrieve the Helm of Winterhold from this destination before talking to Birna and obtaining the coral dragon claw from her, and instead obtain the claw from within the barrow, then one can still return to Birna and receive the second claw for a modest price. However, that will not start a second quest, and returning to the barrow at that point shows things are exactly as they were left.\nIf the &lt;a href=\"Last%20Dragonborn\"&gt;Dragonborn&lt;/a&gt; has started the quest for the Helm of Yngol, then the final room contains &lt;a href=\"Yngol%27s%20Shade\"&gt;Yngol's Shade&lt;/a&gt;, an undead wielding a leveled &lt;a href=\"Ancient%20Nord%20Weapons\"&gt;ancient Nord&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"Ebony%20Weapons%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;ebony&lt;/a&gt; weapon; it appears to use &lt;a href=\"Frost%20Breath\"&gt;Frost Breath&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Disarm\"&gt;Disarm&lt;/a&gt; as its choices in the &lt;a href=\"Thu%27um\"&gt;Thu'um&lt;/a&gt;. Upon defeating Yngol, the exit can be unlocked by removing the &lt;a href=\"Helm%20of%20Yngol\"&gt;Helm of Yngol&lt;/a&gt; from the skeleton seated in the chair. Yngol Barrow is used for multiple quests, and the enemies within may vary depending upon which quests, if any, are active. Yngol's Shade may not always appear, instead being replaced by a &lt;a href=\"draugr%20death%20overlord\"&gt;draugr death overlord&lt;/a&gt; or an unmasked dragon priest. The rest of the barrow may also be either filled with draugr or completely empty before the final room.\nWhile exploring the interior of Yngol Barrow, the Dragonborn will encounter several eerie light orbs. They will follow them around, but are completely harmless. They tweet lightly and roll from room to room often bouncing or coming out of holes and cracks in the wall and ceilings, before pouring out of the puzzle door. They will follow after the Dragonborn, even if no draugr are awakened or present. \nIn the room with the bridge over shallow water, there is a chest and a burial urn under the water on the left hand side.\nPillar puzzle.\nThe Dragonborn will come across the corpse of a scholar and a pillar puzzle early in the dungeon. The scholar's corpse contains a book titled \"&lt;a href=\"Notes%20on%20Yngol%20Barrow\"&gt;Notes on Yngol Barrow&lt;/a&gt;\". It appears he had discovered the barrow in his travels and had been transcribing the Nordic carvings in the cave for the &lt;a href=\"College%20of%20Winterhold%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;College of Winterhold&lt;/a&gt;. The notes provide the key to the pillar puzzle:\nDoor puzzle.\nActivating the lever now opens the gate, revealing a Coral Dragon Claw on a pedestal. If one has already obtained the claw from &lt;a href=\"Winterhold%20%28Skyrim%20City%29\"&gt;Winterhold&lt;/a&gt;, it will not be there. The Coral Claw is used to open the puzzle door and contains a clue to the sequence.\nIts order is (top to bottom): Snake, Wolf, Moth.\nEnemies.\nThe following enemies appear depending on one's active quest:"}

The seas thrashed and churned, and a wrathful storm appeared. Ysgramor took up the oars and rowed into the storm alone.\nUpon the &lt;a href=\"Sea%20of%20Ghosts\"&gt;Sea&lt;/a&gt;, Ysgramor wrestled the sea-ghosts, and the storm carried him along the jagged coast. Two fortnights passed without relief, until finally the storm broke. Come the next dawn, Yngol's long-boat was found in the icy surf, but the vengeful sea-ghosts had already taken Yngol and his clansmen.\nIn his terrible grief, Ysgramor slew a dozen dozen &lt;a href=\"Creatures\"&gt;beasts&lt;/a&gt; and burned them in honor of his fallen kinsman. A &lt;a href=\"Yngol%20Barrow\"&gt;barrow-hill&lt;/a&gt; was dug in the Atmoran tradition, and Yngol was laid to rest with rites and honors among his clansmen far below the rocky face of &lt;a href=\"Hsaarik%20Head\"&gt;Hsaarik Head&lt;/a&gt;, the first &lt;a href=\"Children%20of%20the%20Sky\"&gt;Children of the Sky&lt;/a&gt; to perish in &lt;a href=\"Tamriel\"&gt;Tamriel&lt;/a&gt;."}

Through successful experimentation, Arondil now has a formidable (and entirely female) &lt;a href=\"Draugr%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;draugr&lt;/a&gt; force at his command.\nAdditionally, Arondil has perfected a means to reanimate freshly-dispatched mortals as uniquely spectral minions. The Yngvild ghosts, in fact, were once Dawnstar's young milkmaids. They were either stumbled upon or collected by Arondil and summarily reanimated to do his evil, and evidently perverse, biddings.\nOverview.\nScattered throughout the cave are Arondil's journals, which chronicle his endeavours more completely. The journals are a subject of interest to &lt;a href=\"Vekel%20the%20Man\"&gt;Vekel the Man&lt;/a&gt; of the &lt;a href=\"Thieves%20Guild%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Thieves Guild&lt;/a&gt;, and can be retrieved as part of a miscellaneous objective, for a reward. The journals might stay in your inventory permanently if you pick them up, so it is advised to save before you do so and make sure you can return them."}

He deemed it necessary to kill her and decided to incorporate the \"fresher\" subject into his experiments as well.\nMuch to Arondil's delight, he was successful and found the newly reanimated subject to be spectral in nature and invigorating to his very soul upon touching her. He then endeavored to send his Draugr minions forth to Dawnstar to retrieve more young milkmaids, who had been a lustful fixation of his while living in Dawnstar, to bolster his perverse harem. Exploration of Yngvild will eventually lead to a room where the bodies of the slaughtered milkmaids can be found.\nQuests.\n&lt;a href=\"Toying%20With%20The%20Dead\"&gt;Toying With The Dead&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe ghosts will be guarding Arondil, as well as some of his journals.\nCombat.\nYngvild Ghosts can be combated with mortal weapons as well as magic. They have no magic or special abilities of their own and fight only with the daggers they carried in life. Upon dispatching them, they are rendered to ghostly remains that contain the common clothes and inventory the subject had in life.\nNote, however, that the ghosts appear to level with the player character, making them powerful opponents at levels 30+. Alerting a ghost often also alerts any of the nearby Draugr, which can lead to a lengthy fight."}

Yokeda Kai uses an ability in which he disappears in a fire summoned from his staff, clones himself into four identical versions, and begins using a Flame-Shaper ability in which he shapes fire into a spinning circle and flings the fire onto every delver in his vicinity, an ability akin to that of a regular Flame-Shaper, which must be interrupted accordingly. Yokeda Kai uses a meteor strike ability on a random delver, which has a clear area-of-effect to be seen before it is cast, and so must be avoided. Yokeda Kai will use another area-of-effect attack involving flames on the ground, indicated by him charging his staff. This attack is fatal if not avoided in time, and there will not be much time to avoid it.\nThe roles of the delvers here is for each to assign themselves to Yokeda Kai's clones and interrupt and defeat them in time.

In the depths of the earth, beneath the simple structures of our village, I discovered a place of power and knowledge. It's a place where spirits whisper, waiting for someone to hear them.\nI heard their call. I listened to their holy words over and over and over again. \"You are what you eat,\" they whispered to me. \"You are what you eat, you are what you eat, you are what you eat.\"\nThey never stopped.

A solitary creature was roaming the plains beyond the village. A &lt;a href=\"Giant%20%28Online%29\"&gt;giant&lt;/a&gt;! What better meal could grant power and glory? What would be better than the succulent flesh of a giant?\nThe spirits tell me that the flesh is most potent when consumed raw, right off the bone. There are words to say and ceremonial gestures to make, preparing me for the transfer of power. When this power infuses me, nothing can stop me! Not even death. As long as my head remains attached to my body, I shall return!\nHere is what the spirits taught me. Here is the secret to becoming what you eat. Here is the chant:\nTYO UAR EWHA TYO UEA TYO UAR EWHA TYO UEA TYO UAR EWHA TYO UEA "}

He is one of the most legendary heroes of &lt;a href=\"Men\"&gt;Men&lt;/a&gt;, who played a pivotal role in the ascendancy of humans on the continent of &lt;a href=\"Tamriel\"&gt;Tamriel&lt;/a&gt; in the late &lt;a href=\"Merethic%20Era\"&gt;Merethic Era&lt;/a&gt;, during the period known as &lt;a href=\"The%20Return\"&gt;The Return&lt;/a&gt;.\nYsgramor is also considered the first human historian, as he developed a runic transcription of &lt;a href=\"Nord\"&gt;Nord&lt;/a&gt;ic speech based on &lt;a href=\"Mer\"&gt;Elven&lt;/a&gt; principles. Ysgramor's lasting influence on human history across Tamriel earned him such sobriquets as the \"First Man,\" the \"Bringer of Words,\" and \"Harbinger of Us All\" in bardic tradition and the accounts of historians.\nBiography.\nPre-return events.\nYsgramor was fleeing from a civil war that had broken out in his homeland, the continent of &lt;a href=\"Atmora\"&gt;Atmora&lt;/a&gt;. He and his two sons, &lt;a href=\"Yngol\"&gt;Yngol&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Ylgar\"&gt;Ylgar&lt;/a&gt;, arrived at &lt;a href=\"Hsaarik%20Head\"&gt;Hsaarik Head&lt;/a&gt;, located on the &lt;a href=\"Broken%20Cape\"&gt;Broken Cape&lt;/a&gt;. Ysgramor sought no violence; he was a peaceful settler and wanted to explore these new lands. The newfound continent of &lt;a href=\"Tamriel\"&gt;Tamriel&lt;/a&gt; was named &lt;a href=\"Skyrim\"&gt;Mereth&lt;/a&gt; by the &lt;a href=\"Atmorans\"&gt;Atmorans&lt;/a&gt;, after the strange inhabitants who called themselves \"&lt;a href=\"Mer\"&gt;Mer&lt;/a&gt;\".\nMany &lt;a href=\"Atmoran\"&gt;Atmoran&lt;/a&gt; settlers followed Ysgramor's example and came to Mereth to escape the civil war. Soon, the human population of Tamriel was large enough that they began to build cities, and thus &lt;a href=\"Saarthal\"&gt;Saarthal&lt;/a&gt; was made. However, due to this population boom, the Mer felt endangered and decided to raid human settlements. Almost all of the men were slain in a single night; only Ysgramor and his sons were known to have escaped. They took the last longboat and sailed back to Atmora. This night later became known as the &lt;a href=\"Night%20of%20Tears\"&gt;Night of Tears&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe Return.\nAfter Ysgramor reached Atmora, he found out that the civil war had ended. He told stories of the treacherous elves and all the brothers and sisters who were slain in their raid upon Saarthal. Soon enough, there was a whole army ready to fight and avenge the victims of the elves. This army became known as the &lt;a href=\"Five%20Hundred%20Companions\"&gt;Five Hundred Companions&lt;/a&gt;. Thus began a period known as &lt;a href=\"The%20Return\"&gt;The Return&lt;/a&gt;.\nOn the day known as the &lt;a href=\"Day%20of%20Final%20Passage\"&gt;Day of Final Passage&lt;/a&gt;, Ysgramor and his Five Hundred Companions set sail for &lt;a href=\"Skyrim\"&gt;Mereth&lt;/a&gt; from the massive shipyards of &lt;a href=\"Jylkurfyk\"&gt;Jylkurfyk&lt;/a&gt;. Ysgramor himself commanded a longboat by the name of &lt;a href=\"Ylgermet\"&gt;Ylgermet&lt;/a&gt;. Both of his sons had earned their places as renowned warriors and had taken two longboats under their command as well, &lt;a href=\"Harakk\"&gt;Harakk&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Darumzu\"&gt;Darumzu&lt;/a&gt;.\nHowever, during their voyage to Hsaarik, the fleet was hit by the &lt;a href=\"Storm%20of%20Separation\"&gt;Storm of Separation&lt;/a&gt;. Both of his sons were separated from the rest of the fleet, and only the youngest, &lt;a href=\"Ylgar\"&gt;Ylgar&lt;/a&gt;, sailed out of it alive. It is said that Ysgramor was enraged by this. He went out in the storm alone to seek Yngol but failed. By the time Ysgramor found the shipwreck of Harakk, Yngol and his crew were already slain by the &lt;a href=\"sea-ghost\"&gt;sea-ghost&lt;/a&gt;s. Ysgramor is said to have hunted and burned the ghosts in their honor afterwards. Ysgramor buried his son by the Atmoran traditions within a barrow. The barrow became known by the name of &lt;a href=\"Yngol%20Barrow\"&gt;Yngol Barrow&lt;/a&gt; and played a role in later events.\nAfter the Five Hundred had reached Hsaarik Head, they sought to reclaim &lt;a href=\"Saarthal\"&gt;Saarthal&lt;/a&gt; from elvenkind. Shortly after landing, Ysgramor and his companions started marching towards the city, but before they reached it, a man skilled in the ways of magic approached them. The man, calling himself &lt;a href=\"Ahzidal\"&gt;Ahzidal&lt;/a&gt;, was a fellow survivor of the fall of Saarthal, who had heard of Ysgramor and his companions' goal. Ahzidal himself was bent on revenge upon the Elves, as he had himself lost his family in the attack on the city, and had since wandered Tamriel and studied many kinds of powerful magic knowledge to find a way to get an edge over them. Finding that their goals overlapped, Ahzidal offered to share the gifts of his learnings with Ysgramor and his army to help them against the Elves, and Ysgramor accepted the offer. Ahzidal then went to work, bestowing powerful enchantments on all of the warrior's steel weapons.\nEmpowered by Ahzidal's enchantments, Ysgramor and his companions started their fight with the elves in earnest. During their battle, many of their &lt;a href=\"shield-brothers\"&gt;shield-brothers&lt;/a&gt; fell, but the army kept the name in honor of the fallen warriors. After reclaiming Saarthal, the &lt;a href=\"Circle%20of%20Captains\"&gt;Circle of Captains&lt;/a&gt; was assembled, where it was decided that every &lt;a href=\"Captain%20%28Lore%29\"&gt;captain&lt;/a&gt; and his crew should make their own paths and separate. Thus began the great expansion of &lt;a href=\"Men\"&gt;Men&lt;/a&gt; on &lt;a href=\"Tamriel\"&gt;Tamriel&lt;/a&gt; and the genocidal slaughter of the elves. The Five Hundred were known to have spread from mountainous &lt;a href=\"Skyrim\"&gt;Skyrim&lt;/a&gt; to far southern marshes of &lt;a href=\"Black%20Marsh\"&gt;Black Marsh&lt;/a&gt; and even to the isle of &lt;a href=\"Solstheim\"&gt;Solstheim&lt;/a&gt;.\nYsgramor and his crew, with the help of &lt;a href=\"Kaal%20Kaaz\"&gt;Kaal Kaaz&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Sadon%20Reyth\"&gt;Sadon Reyth&lt;/a&gt;, fought the elves in the area later named &lt;a href=\"Eastmarch\"&gt;Eastmarch&lt;/a&gt;. Ysgramor stumbled upon his recently dead son's grave once more, and, in grief, decided to build a great city where the nearby river met the sea. It was to serve as a monument for mankind. The city was built by elven slaves in Atmoran fashion. It was made as an impenetrable fortress. Ysgramor commanded that a great bridge be built over the &lt;a href=\"White%20River\"&gt;White River&lt;/a&gt;, so no elf could attempt to sneak over and avenge his kin. A great palace was built that served as the seat of kings for many generations after Ysgramor himself. It is said that deep underneath &lt;a href=\"Windhelm\"&gt;Windhelm&lt;/a&gt;, a huge crypt was built to be worthy for legendary Ysgramor himself.\nSometime later Ysgramor and his companions went to war with the giants. In the end, their most challenging enemy was &lt;a href=\"Sinmur\"&gt;Sinmur&lt;/a&gt;, a giant who had already killed some of the companions such as &lt;a href=\"Hakra\"&gt;Hakra&lt;/a&gt;. After going to his barrow, Ysgramor destroyed the giant's club with &lt;a href=\"Wuuthrad\"&gt;Wuuthrad&lt;/a&gt; and killed the giant.\nDeath.\nNews of Ysgramor's final breath went over Tamriel like a huge dark cloud. It is said that even the fiercest of warriors put down their mighty axes, and in grief swore never to pick them up again. The death of Ysgramor ended the period of the Return. Most of the Five Hundred had settled. It is from them, that most modern Tamrielic human races had evolved.\nDespite the crypt that had been already built for him in Windhelm, Ysgramor chose to be buried on the coast of the &lt;a href=\"Sea%20of%20Ghosts\"&gt;Sea of Ghosts&lt;/a&gt;, looking in the direction of his birthplace, Atmora. &lt;a href=\"Ysgramor%27s%20Tomb\"&gt;Ysgramor's Tomb&lt;/a&gt; is located north-west of &lt;a href=\"Winterhold%20%28City%29\"&gt;Winterhold&lt;/a&gt;.\nLegacy.\nYsgramor was the founder of great factions, such as &lt;a href=\"the%20Companions\"&gt;the Companions&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Nordic%20Empire\"&gt;First Empire&lt;/a&gt;, beginning the &lt;a href=\"Ysgramor%20Dynasty\"&gt;Ysgramor Dynasty&lt;/a&gt;. It would last until the death of &lt;a href=\"King%20Borgas\"&gt;King Borgas&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"1E%20369\"&gt;1E 369&lt;/a&gt;.\nDue to the actions of Ysgramor, the race of &lt;a href=\"Snow%20Elves\"&gt;Snow Elves&lt;/a&gt; was banished underground, only to emerge some thousands of years later as &lt;a href=\"beastfolk\"&gt;beastfolk&lt;/a&gt; known as the &lt;a href=\"Falmer\"&gt;Falmer&lt;/a&gt;. Some believe that the Falmer still hold a grudge against humanity and the day will come when they will attempt to reconquer the land that once belonged to them.\nMany legends exist about Ysgramor avoiding the tricks of the &lt;a href=\"Daedric%20Prince\"&gt;Daedric Prince&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Herma-Mora\"&gt;Herma-Mora&lt;/a&gt;.\nIn &lt;a href=\"2E%20582\"&gt;2E 582&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"Vestige\"&gt;Vestige&lt;/a&gt; was assisted by the spirits of Ysgramor, along with his sons &lt;a href=\"Yngol\"&gt;Yngol&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Ylgar\"&gt;Ylgar&lt;/a&gt;, in banishing the newly resurrected spirit of the giant &lt;a href=\"Sinmur\"&gt;Sinmur&lt;/a&gt;.\nIn &lt;a href=\"4E%20201\"&gt;4E 201&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"Last%20Dragonborn\"&gt;Last Dragonborn&lt;/a&gt; met Ysgramor when they entered the &lt;a href=\"Hall%20of%20Valor\"&gt;Hall of Valor&lt;/a&gt; in search of help in defeating &lt;a href=\"Alduin%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Alduin&lt;/a&gt; as they delved into the realm of &lt;a href=\"Sovngarde%20%28Location%29\"&gt;Sovngarde&lt;/a&gt; in their pursuit of defeating the Dragon.\nBloodline.\nYsgramor had only two sons. His elder son, &lt;a href=\"Yngol\"&gt;Yngol&lt;/a&gt;, was killed by &lt;a href=\"Sea-Ghost\"&gt;Sea-Ghost&lt;/a&gt;s in the &lt;a href=\"Storm%20of%20Separation\"&gt;Storm of Separation&lt;/a&gt; and thus never settled in &lt;a href=\"Skyrim\"&gt;Mereth&lt;/a&gt; to have a family of his own. His youngest son, &lt;a href=\"Ylgar\"&gt;Ylgar&lt;/a&gt;, did survive the &lt;a href=\"Nordic-Falmer%20War\"&gt;Nordic-Falmer War&lt;/a&gt; and had descendants of his own. It is said that all Nordic Kings are descended from Ysgramor as well."}

The tomb itself may only be fully accessed after Ysgramor's Axe, &lt;a href=\"Wuuthrad%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Wuuthrad&lt;/a&gt;, has been reformed at the &lt;a href=\"Skyforge%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Skyforge&lt;/a&gt; by &lt;a href=\"Eorlund%20Gray-Mane\"&gt;Eorlund Gray-Mane&lt;/a&gt; and placed back on its statue at the main entrance.\nThe tomb is made of several large rooms, and tunnels connecting them. It is guarded by many &lt;a href=\"Companion%20Ghost\"&gt;Companion Ghost&lt;/a&gt;s. Certain rooms are inhabited by &lt;a href=\"Frostbite%20Spider%20%28Skyrim%29%23Giant%20Frostbite%20Spider\"&gt;Giant Frostbite Spiders&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Frostbite%20Spider%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Frostbite Spiders&lt;/a&gt;, as well as &lt;a href=\"Skeever%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Skeevers&lt;/a&gt;.\nWord wall.\nThere are two ways to access the word wall:\nQuests.\n&lt;a href=\"Glory%20of%20the%20Dead\"&gt;Glory of the Dead&lt;/a&gt;.\nIn the Companions quest line, the &lt;a href=\"Last%20Dragonborn\"&gt;Last Dragonborn&lt;/a&gt;\u00a0is required to come here with other members of the Circle and purify the soul of &lt;a href=\"Kodlak%20Whitemane\"&gt;Kodlak Whitemane&lt;/a&gt;. They must fight their way through the tomb, defeating the ghosts of past companions as well as some skeevers and frostbite spiders. At the end of the tomb, the Last Dragonborn will speak with the ghost of Kodlak, who will tell them more of the Companions in the afterlife.\nAfter a short dialogue, the Last Dragonborn will be asked to throw a &lt;a href=\"Glenmoril%20Witch%20Head\"&gt;Glenmoril Witch Head&lt;/a&gt; into the fire, thereby releasing &lt;a href=\"Kodlak%27s%20Wolf%20Spirit\"&gt;Kodlak's Wolf Spirit&lt;/a&gt;. After killing the wolf spirit, Kodlak will thank them and tell them that they are to become the new &lt;a href=\"Harbinger%20%28Rank%29\"&gt;Harbinger&lt;/a&gt; of the Companions. The tomb can now be exited through the stairs in the far right corner of the room behind where Kodlak was.

They will either mention their standard radiant quests, or express their desire to be cleansed of &lt;a href=\"Lycanthropy%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;lycanthropy&lt;/a&gt; like Kodlak, which will initiate the quest. After leading the Companion to the tomb, the Last Dragonborn must throw another of the Glenmoril Witches' heads into the fire, summoning Vilkas' or Farkas' wolf spirit, depending on which of the brothers is following the Last Dragonborn. After the spirit is defeated, the Companion will no longer be a &lt;a href=\"Werewolf%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;werewolf&lt;/a&gt;.\nThis quest has two variants, one for Vilkas, and one for Farkas. &lt;a href=\"Aela%20the%20Huntress%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Aela&lt;/a&gt; does not want to cure her lycanthropy, leaving the last witch's head if the Last Dragonborn wants to be cleansed of lycanthropy.\nCuring lycanthropy.\nAfter completing the quest Glory of the Dead, the Last Dragonborn can cure their lycanthropy like they did with Kodlak. Throwing another Glenmoril Witches' Head into the fire while no Companion is around will summon the Last Dragonborn's wolf spirit. After defeating it, the Last Dragonborn is no longer a werewolf."}

The dynasty can be traced back to the late &lt;a href=\"Merethic%20Era\"&gt;Merethic Era&lt;/a&gt; when &lt;a href=\"Ysgramor\"&gt;Ysgramor&lt;/a&gt; first set foot on &lt;a href=\"Skyrim\"&gt;Skyrim&lt;/a&gt; at &lt;a href=\"Hsaarik%20Head\"&gt;Hsaarik Head&lt;/a&gt; and continued until the death of &lt;a href=\"Borgas\"&gt;Borgas&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"1E%20369\"&gt;1E 369&lt;/a&gt;. The capital of the empire was located in &lt;a href=\"Windhelm\"&gt;Windhelm&lt;/a&gt;, where the &lt;a href=\"Palace%20of%20the%20Kings\"&gt;Palace of the Kings&lt;/a&gt; still dominates the center of the ancient city.\nHistory.\nYsgramor's reign.\nThe origins of the Ysgramor dynasty date back to the late &lt;a href=\"Merethic%20Era\"&gt;Merethic Era&lt;/a&gt; when Ysgramor and his sons escaped the slaughter of the first human city of &lt;a href=\"Saarthal\"&gt;Saarthal&lt;/a&gt; by the native elves. He returned to Skyrim with an army known as the &lt;a href=\"Five%20Hundred%20Companions\"&gt;Five Hundred Companions&lt;/a&gt; and lead a reprisal campaign against the elvish population. The city of Saarthal was retaken and eventually rebuilt. Ysgramor then ordered the construction of Windhelm, which would serve as the capital of the Empire.\nIn the following years, Ysgramor and his army hunted the remaining Elves to near extinction. Once Skyrim had been purged of Snow Elves, the ancient Nords turned their attention to &lt;a href=\"Solstheim\"&gt;Solstheim&lt;/a&gt; where a great number of skirmishes were said to have taken place.\nHarald's reign.\n&lt;a href=\"Harald\"&gt;Harald&lt;/a&gt; was born in &lt;a href=\"1E%20113\"&gt;1E 113&lt;/a&gt; and rose to High King in 1E 143. He was the thirteenth of the line of Ysgramor, and is remembered as being the first King to relinquish all holdings in &lt;a href=\"Atmora\"&gt;Atmora&lt;/a&gt;. Thus it was he that truly made the Nords a separate people. He was also the first High King Skyrim ever had.\nIn &lt;a href=\"1E%20139\"&gt;1E 139&lt;/a&gt; he ordered a campaign against the remaining &lt;a href=\"Snow%20Elves\"&gt;Snow Elves&lt;/a&gt; of Skyrim in the region near &lt;a href=\"Lake%20Honrich\"&gt;Lake Honrich&lt;/a&gt;.\nAfter a reign of 78 years, he died in &lt;a href=\"1E%20221\"&gt;1E 221&lt;/a&gt; at the exceptional age of 108 years. He outlived all but three of his sons.\nHjalmer's reign.\n&lt;a href=\"Hjalmer\"&gt;Hjalmer&lt;/a&gt; was the second known ruler of Skyrim. Hjalmer became king of Skyrim in 1E 221, after his father Harald died, when the first ever Moot was called. He didn't stay long as king because he died in &lt;a href=\"1E%20222\"&gt;1E 222&lt;/a&gt;, of unknown reasons. His younger brother Vrage (sometimes said to be his son) became the next High King.\nVrage's reign.\nIn &lt;a href=\"1E%20240\"&gt;1E 240&lt;/a&gt;, King &lt;a href=\"Vrage\"&gt;Vrage&lt;/a&gt; the Gifted began the ruthless military expansion from &lt;a href=\"Skyrim\"&gt;Skyrim&lt;/a&gt; into other provinces. The campaign was later called the &lt;a href=\"Skyrim%20Conquests\"&gt;Skyrim Conquests&lt;/a&gt; and within a span of fifty years, the Empire ruled all of northern Tamriel, including most of present-day &lt;a href=\"High%20Rock\"&gt;High Rock&lt;/a&gt;, a deep stretch of the &lt;a href=\"Nibenay%20Valley\"&gt;Nibenay Valley&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Cyrodiil\"&gt;Cyrodiil&lt;/a&gt;, and the whole of &lt;a href=\"Morrowind\"&gt;Morrowind&lt;/a&gt;.\nGellir's reign.\n&lt;a href=\"Gellir\"&gt;Gellir&lt;/a&gt; continued Vrage's legacy of expansion and conquest. Historians have attributed him as a master tactician in his wars against the &lt;a href=\"Dwemer\"&gt;Dwemer&lt;/a&gt;, where several Dwemer cities all across Skyrim fell to his armies.\nBorgas' reign.\n&lt;a href=\"Borgas\"&gt;Borgas&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"Winterhold%20%28City%29\"&gt;Winterhold&lt;/a&gt; was the last of the Ysgramor Dynasty. He was perhaps best known for outlawing the old Nordic pantheon of deities. He is also believed to be the last monarch to wear the legendary &lt;a href=\"The%20Jagged%20Crown%20%28Item%29\"&gt;Jagged Crown&lt;/a&gt;.\nHe was killed during the &lt;a href=\"Wild%20Hunt\"&gt;Wild Hunt&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"1E%20369\"&gt;1E 369&lt;/a&gt;. His body was secretly returned to Skyrim and buried with the crown in the Nordic tomb of &lt;a href=\"Korvanjund\"&gt;Korvanjund&lt;/a&gt;.\nFollowing his death, Skyrim was plunged into the &lt;a href=\"War%20of%20Succession\"&gt;War of Succession&lt;/a&gt;, during which Skyrim lost control of its territories in &lt;a href=\"High%20Rock\"&gt;High Rock&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Morrowind\"&gt;Morrowind&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Cyrodiil\"&gt;Cyrodiil&lt;/a&gt;, never to regain them.\nPrevious kings.\nThe following is a list of kings from the Ysgramor Dynasty and their respective reigns."}

According to the Greybeards, the name \"Ysmir\" is also a title which means \"Dragon of the North.\" It was given to the Emperor &lt;a href=\"Tiber%20Septim\"&gt;Tiber Septim&lt;/a&gt;, who withstood the power of &lt;a href=\"the%20Greybeards\"&gt;the Greybeards&lt;/a&gt;' &lt;a href=\"Thu%27um\"&gt;Thu'um&lt;/a&gt;; they recognized him as a &lt;a href=\"Dragonborn%20%28Lore%29\"&gt;Dragonborn&lt;/a&gt; and gave him the title.\nDeity.\nYsmir the deity is the Nordic aspect of the Imperial God known as &lt;a href=\"Talos\"&gt;Talos&lt;/a&gt;, after he had been called to High Hrothgar by the Greybeards to conquer Tamriel. On his death, he became Talos in the Imperial Pantheon, and Ysmir in the Nordic one.\nTitle.\nYsmir is also a name that was attributed to &lt;a href=\"Wulfharth\"&gt;Wulfharth&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Pelinal%20Whitestrake\"&gt;Pelinal Whitestrake&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Tiber%20Septim\"&gt;Tiber Septim&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Last%20Dragonborn\"&gt;Last Dragonborn&lt;/a&gt;.\nYsmir Wulfharth.\nYsmir Wulfharth was an Atmoran born Nordic King during the First Era. His Thu'um was said to have been greatly powerful. Originally, Wulfharth thought he was called by the Greybeards when they were calling for Talos. But when he arrived, he was destroyed by their voices, as he was not the one destined to unite Tamriel.\nPelinal Whitestrake.\nPelinal Whitestrake was a Nedic or Imperial knight who fought against the Ayleids during Alessia's slave uprising. He would later be known as the Divine Crusader, but also as Ysmir.\nTiber Septim.\nTiber Septim was a Dragonborn who was granted the title by the Greybeards. He was also the first Emperor of the &lt;a href=\"Third%20Era\"&gt;Third Era&lt;/a&gt; and the first member of the &lt;a href=\"Septim%20Dynasty\"&gt;Septim dynasty&lt;/a&gt;, as well as the first Emperor to rule over the entirety of Tamriel after using the &lt;a href=\"Numidium\"&gt;Numidium&lt;/a&gt; to defeat the &lt;a href=\"Second%20Aldmeri%20Dominion\"&gt;Second Aldmeri Dominion&lt;/a&gt;. He is widely believed to have ascended to Godhood and having become Talos, though his worship has been legally banned in the empire by the &lt;a href=\"White-Gold%20Concordat\"&gt;White-Gold Concordat&lt;/a&gt;. The most common belief is that he was born in Atmora under the name of Talos, which means \"Stormcrown\", that he grew up in Skyrim and became General of the Colovian Estates under King (and later Emperor) Cuhlecain. That he met the combined army of Skyrim and High Rock, who were hostile to Cuhlecain, on the cliffs of Sancre Tor and that the former joined him when they saw him use the Thu'um and saw he was Dragonborn. Another less common belief is that he was born in Alcaire, High Rock, under the name of Hjalti Early Beard and that, instead of only using his own Thu'um against the reachmen, was aided by none other than Wulfharth (then known as the Ash-King, Ysmir the Grey Wind, Storm of &lt;a href=\"Kyne\"&gt;Kyne&lt;/a&gt;), who he later betrayed in order to power the &lt;a href=\"Mantella\"&gt;Mantella&lt;/a&gt; and be able to use the Numidium. Either way, in both versions he adopts the name of Tiber Septim and is arguably the most influential and known of the individuals who were granted the title of Ysmir by 4th Era 201.\nThe Last Dragonborn.\nDuring the events that unfold in , after completing \"&lt;a href=\"The%20Horn%20of%20Jurgen%20Windcaller\"&gt;The Horn of Jurgen Windcaller&lt;/a&gt;,\" the Greybeards greet the &lt;a href=\"Last%20Dragonborn\"&gt;Last Dragonborn&lt;/a&gt; in the dragon tongue with the words: \"Lingrah krosis saraan Strundu'ul, voth nid balaan klov praan nau. Naal Thu'umu, mu ofan nii nu, Dovahkiin, naal suleyk do Kaan, naal suleyk do Shor, ahrk naal suleyk do Atmorasewuth. Meyz nu Ysmir, Dovahsebrom. Dahmaan daar rok.\". This can be translated by: \"Long has the Stormcrown languished, with no worthy brow to sit upon. By our breath, we bestow it now to you, in the name of Kyne, in the name of Shor, and in the name of Atmora of Old. You are Ysmir now, the Dragon of the North, hearken to it.\""}

If I rest to the East or the West or the North or the South, it will only cause division.\n\"The local peoples will claim my tomb as their own. They will say, 'Ysmir is our king, for he rests among us.' And my children will fight amongst themselves and divide my body among them, sending my head one way, my hands another, and my feet, and my mighty heart.\"\nFrom among his thanes and housecarls, a young man, not more than a boy, whom none of them had seen before, then dared to speak. Bowing low, he said \"Then do not go anywhere on Nirn, but go to the sky, where you can watch over all your peoples.\"\nYsmir king of men and dragons liked this idea. He said, \"But boy, how would I reach the sky? Is there a mountain, or a ladder built by men that can reach so high?\"\nAnd the boy said \"There is no such thing, neither mountain nor ladder nor staircase. But I know of a place, a single stone. This is the path to &lt;a href=\"Aetherius\"&gt;Aetherius&lt;/a&gt;.\"\n\"Where can I find this stone?\" cried the king of men and dragons, intent on ascending to the sky.\n\"Follow me,\" the boy beckoned.\nAnd Ysmir summoned all of his champions and housecarls and told them how he was intent to end his life by ascending to the sky. And all of them, every one, agreed to follow him to the place where the boy led.\nAnd when they reached the place, they found as the boy promised, a single stone. And Ysmir, who was by now very old, laid at the foot of the stone and was taken up into the stars.\nThe champions and housecarls looked up into the heavens and saw their king, the great &lt;a href=\"The%20Warrior\"&gt;Warrior&lt;/a&gt;, riding across the sky. And he was accompanied by three servants, &lt;a href=\"The%20Lord\"&gt;a Lord&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"The%20Lady\"&gt;his Lady&lt;/a&gt;, and his &lt;a href=\"The%20Steed\"&gt;mighty Steed&lt;/a&gt;.\nAnd the champions and housecarls all pledged to guard the valley and the way to Aetherius.

After the Dragonborn has given Ysolda a mammoth tusk for \"Rare Gifts,\" she becomes a candidate for marriage.\nPersonality.\nYsolda comes across as a bargain hunter and keen tradeswoman, yet her personality seems quite friendly if a bit nosy. Most of her interactions with other characters are friendly, while at other times she will exchange a few hostile words.\nInteractions.\n&lt;a href=\"Rare%20Gifts\"&gt;Rare Gifts&lt;/a&gt;.\nYsolda asks the &lt;a href=\"Last%20Dragonborn\"&gt;Dragonborn&lt;/a&gt; to find her a &lt;a href=\"Mammoth%20Tusk\"&gt;Mammoth Tusk&lt;/a&gt;, which she needs to give to a &lt;a href=\"Khajiit%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Khajiit&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Khajiit%20Caravan%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;caravaneer&lt;/a&gt;.

Though the tusk is supposed to be given to a Khajiit caravaneer, she does not appear to ever relinquish it, and it can be reacquired later in the game. She will even accept a stolen tusk, such as one from &lt;a href=\"Jorrvaskr\"&gt;Jorrvaskr&lt;/a&gt;.\n&lt;a href=\"A%20Night%20to%20Remember%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;A Night to Remember&lt;/a&gt;.\nYsolda can be involved in the quest \"A Night to Remember,\" and is one of the possible characters that gives the Dragonborn the wedding ring.

Due to &lt;a href=\"Radiant%20A.I.\"&gt;Radiant A.I.&lt;/a&gt;, this will not always be the case. After completing the quest, it may be difficult to find Ysolda.

If the Dragonborn chooses to help Ehlhiel, she will be alive and hostile. On her person is a full set of &lt;a href=\"Leather%20Scout%20Armor\"&gt;Leather Scout Armor&lt;/a&gt;.\nHistory.\nPrior to &lt;a href=\"4E%20201\"&gt;4E 201&lt;/a&gt;, a &lt;a href=\"Bosmer\"&gt;Bosmer&lt;/a&gt; member of the Dirks and a hopeless romantic, &lt;a href=\"Fathrys\"&gt;Fathrys&lt;/a&gt;, attempted to court Zaharia. Zaharia told jokingly told Fathrys that she would wed him if he brought her a &lt;a href=\"Dragon%20Scales\"&gt;dragon's scale&lt;/a&gt;. Taking the request seriously, Fathrys attempted to recover the &lt;a href=\"Studded%20Dragonscale%20Armor\"&gt;armor&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"Ulfnir%20Bone-Skin\"&gt;Ulfnir Bone-Skin&lt;/a&gt; made from the scales of the dragon &lt;a href=\"Vithrelnaak\"&gt;Vithrelnaak&lt;/a&gt;, and wrote her an undelivered poem. Fathrys would later be killed by the undead skeleton of Ulfnir in the attempt.\nFollowing the dissolution of the Crimson Dirks, Zaharia identified and located &lt;a href=\"Urgnok\"&gt;Urgnok&lt;/a&gt;, another former member, who had concealed his identity and was performing as an arena gladiator. She had killed the bearer of a letter intended to be handed to the guards identifying Urgnok. Zaharia directed Urgnok to head north to the &lt;a href=\"Orc%20Strongholds\"&gt;strongholds&lt;/a&gt; or fight in the pits if he wanted to stay out of jail. Zaharia was also a member of the &lt;a href=\"Blades%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Blades&lt;/a&gt;, though it is unknown if she was a member before joining the Crimson Dirks or became one after the Dirks disbanded."}

To do so the Nerevarine must visit and complete a number of tasks for each Tribe.\nKaushad and Sonummu Zabamat.\nAfter receiving councel from &lt;a href=\"Nibani%20Maesa\"&gt;Nibani Maesa&lt;/a&gt;, the Nerevarine begins the quest by traveling to the &lt;a href=\"Zainab%20Camp%20%28Morrowind%29\"&gt;Zainab Camp&lt;/a&gt; that Nibani marked on the map. The camp can be found on the western edge of the &lt;a href=\"Grazelands%20%28Morrowind%29\"&gt;Grazelands&lt;/a&gt;, between &lt;a href=\"Venim%20Ancestral%20Tomb%20%28Morrowind%29\"&gt;Venim Ancestral Tomb&lt;/a&gt;\u00a0and\u00a0&lt;a href=\"Sethan%20Ancestral%20Tomb%20%28Morrowind%29\"&gt;Sethan Ancestral Tomb&lt;/a&gt;. The Nerevarine finds &lt;a href=\"Sonummu%20Zabamat\"&gt;Sonummu Zabamat&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Wise%20Woman%27s%20Yurt%20%28Zainab%29\"&gt;Wise Woman&lt;/a&gt; of the Zainab Tribe, whom tells the Nerevarine that in order to be declared as such they must speak to &lt;a href=\"Kaushad\"&gt;Kaushad&lt;/a&gt;, Ashkhan of the Zainab.\nKaushad, however, needs to receive a gift before accepting to talk to the Nerevarine. Sonummu advises to offer some &lt;a href=\"Exquisite%20Shoes\"&gt;Exquisite Shoes&lt;/a&gt; to Kaushad. Once, the gift is offered to Kaushad, he requires the Hero to complete a task for him. This task is to kill the vampire, &lt;a href=\"Calvario\"&gt;Calvario&lt;/a&gt;, living in &lt;a href=\"Nerano%20Ancestral%20Tomb%20%28Morrowind%29\"&gt;Nerano Ancestral Tomb&lt;/a&gt;.\nNerano Ancestral Tomb.\nIf questioned, Kaushad, will give directions to the tomb. Which can be found not far north of the camp, and north east of &lt;a href=\"Nchuleft%20%28Morrowind%29\"&gt;Nchuleft&lt;/a&gt;, between two trees. The Tomb itself contains a small of corridor and two chambers with a few &lt;a href=\"Leveled%20Creatures%20%28Morrowind%29\"&gt;leveled creatures&lt;/a&gt;. In the final room of the Tomb, waits Calvario. Once he has been killed, the Nerevarine must return to Kaushad.\nKaushad's Bride.\nUpon returning to Kaushad, he tells the Nerevarine that they must bring a bride for him. He further requires that this bride should be a &lt;a href=\"House%20Telvanni%20%28Morrowind%29\"&gt;Telvanni&lt;/a&gt; high-born, who is \"pretty, plump, with big hips\". Then, Kaushad tells the Hero to speak to Sonummu. When questioned about Kaushad's request, Sonummu, devises a plan, the Nerevarine should buy a &lt;a href=\"Slave%20%28Morrowind%29\"&gt;Slave&lt;/a&gt; and disguise her, then, present her to Kaushad. Sonummu suggests speaking to &lt;a href=\"Savile%20Imayn\"&gt;Savile Imayn&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Tel%20Aruhn%20%28Morrowind%29\"&gt;Tel Aruhn&lt;/a&gt; to buy a slave.\nAfter travelling to Tel Aruhn, and finding Savile Imayn. The Nerevarine may question her about \"something special\". Imayn suggests buying an\u00a0&lt;a href=\"Exquisite%20Shirt\"&gt;Exquisite Shirt&lt;/a&gt;, an &lt;a href=\"Exquisite%20Skirt\"&gt;Exquisite Skirt&lt;/a&gt;, some &lt;a href=\"Exquisite%20Shoes\"&gt;Exquisite Shoes&lt;/a&gt; and a flask of &lt;a href=\"Telvanni%20Bug%20Musk\"&gt;Telvanni Bug Musk&lt;/a&gt; perfume, to prepare the disguise of the slave. She indicates for the exquisite clothes, and for the Telvanni Bug Musk. And, also explains that both merchants can be found in Tel Mora.\nOnce all is acquired, and the Nerevarine has returned to Imayn, she will sell the slave, &lt;a href=\"Falura%20Llervu\"&gt;Falura Llervu&lt;/a&gt;, for 1,200 gold, and suggests to give the perfume and the exquisite clothes to the slave, so that she may dress up.\nThe Nerevarine must, then, escort Falura to the Zainab Camp from Tel Aruhn.\nZainab Nerevarine.\nUpon the Nerevarine's return to the Zainab Camp, inside &lt;a href=\"Ashkhan%27s%20Yurt%20%28Zainab%29\"&gt;Kaushad's yurt&lt;/a&gt;, Kaushad expresses his pleasure in Falura Llervu and grants the Nerevarine the &lt;a href=\"Thong%20of%20Zainab\"&gt;Thong of Zainab&lt;/a&gt; as a token for becoming the Zainab Nerevarine.\nFurther conversation with Kaushad reveals that he is fully aware that Falura Llervu is not a Telvanni high-born, a point which does not anger him, but he is rather impressed with the Nerevarine's cunningness. And gives the Nerevarine &lt;a href=\"Ashkhan%27s%20Wedding%20Gift\"&gt;a wedding gift&lt;/a&gt;."}

The Ashlanders retain the modest nomadic life and simple ancestor worship of their forebears, and despise the soft lives and decadent worships of the settled &lt;a href=\"Great%20House\"&gt;Great House&lt;/a&gt;\u00a0&lt;a href=\"Dunmer\"&gt;Dunmer&lt;/a&gt; cultures. The Wastes are harsh and unforgiving, and we are a hard people. But there is a beauty and honor in our simple lives, and the snobs of the &lt;a href=\"Tribunal%20Temple\"&gt;Temple&lt;/a&gt; and Great Houses are fools to dismiss us as crude savages.\nAshlanders and foreigners.\nMost Ashlanders wish all foreigners and their false gods could be driven from Morrowind. At very least, Ashlanders wish the foreign devils would leave them in peace. Ashlanders think it shameful to attack unarmed persons, but they will kill without hesitation an armed person who offends them or their clan laws. No Ashlander is fool enough to make war against the Empire. However, if such a war might be won, many Ashlanders might cheerfully give their lives to win such a war.\nAshlander courtesy.\nAshlanders may challenge a stranger who enters a yurt without invitation. Customs differ with different tribes, but leave when requested, and you may be forgiven. Be particularly careful about &lt;a href=\"ashkhan\"&gt;ashkhan&lt;/a&gt;s\u2014tribal chiefs\u2014and &lt;a href=\"wise%20women\"&gt;wise women&lt;/a&gt;\u2014tribal seers and counselors. Some are welcoming, some are hostile. Be courteous, and leave if requested. If offended, they may attack.\nAshlander challenges.\nWhen challenged for sport, it is acceptable to decline. When challenged for honor, it is shameful to decline. Honor challenges come from offense given in speech or action, or may represent customary formal challenges of status or ritual.\nAshlander worship.\nAll Ashlanders in a tribe, young and small, are born into the Ancestor cult of their clan. The Nerevarine cult is different, though; it is a very small cult, with only a few wise women with the gift of prophecy, and a few holy warrior-heroes who guard and protect the seers. &lt;a href=\"Sul-Matuul\"&gt;Sul-Matuul&lt;/a&gt;, Ashkhan of the &lt;a href=\"Urshilaku%20Tribe%20%28Morrowind%29\"&gt;Urshilaku&lt;/a&gt;, is the Warrior-Protector of the cult, and &lt;a href=\"Nibani%20Maesa\"&gt;Nibani Maesa&lt;/a&gt;, also of the Urshilaku, is the Oracle-Seer of the cult.\nNerevarine cult.\nThey worship the Great Ashkhan and Hortator, Nerevar Moon-and-Star, who in ages past destroyed the evil, godless dwarves and banished the treacherous Dagoth Ur and his foul hosts beneath Red Mountain. The cult is of small consequence in Ashlander worship, and only among the Urshilaku do its followers have any influence. Others Ashlanders tribes share the sentiments of the cult, but regard the Nerevarine prophecies with suspicion and skepticism.\nNerevarine prophecies.\nIt is said that prophecies foretell the return of a reincarnated Nerevar, who shall drive the foreigners from the Ashlands and who shall cast down the false gods of the Temple, and restore the true worships of the Ancestors. It is a dream that would appeal to every Ashlander, but many Ashlanders think it is a silly ancient legend, and little more.\nThe Urshilaku Ashlanders.\nThe Urshilaku are the Ashlanders of the northern Ashlands and the &lt;a href=\"West%20Gash%20%28Morrowind%29\"&gt;West Gash&lt;/a&gt;, in the northwest of &lt;a href=\"Vvardenfell%20%28Morrowind%29\"&gt;Vvardenfell&lt;/a&gt;. Ashkhan Sul-Matuul is their chief, a brave and respected war leader, and Warrior-Protector of the Nerevarine cult. Nibani Maesa is their wise woman, a deep and shrewd counselor, and seer of the Nerevarine cult. The Urshilaku camp moves with the herds, but usually lies close to the &lt;a href=\"Sea%20of%20Ghosts\"&gt;Sea of Ghosts&lt;/a&gt;, north of the village of &lt;a href=\"Maar%20Gan\"&gt;Maar Gan&lt;/a&gt;, on the northern coast of the northern Ashlands."}

The Nerevarine has several options; if the Nerevarine has sufficient\u00a0&lt;a href=\"Speechcraft%20%28Morrowind%29\"&gt;Speechcraft&lt;/a&gt;, it is possible to raise his &lt;a href=\"Personality%20%28Morrowind%29\"&gt;disposition&lt;/a&gt;. He will, then gratefully answer questions about the Nerevarine Cult and his prophecy. Or, the Nerevarine will need to talk about the Ashlander's \"thoughtful gift\" tradition, Hassour will then say that he likes poetry. There are three books that he will accept:\u00a0\"&lt;a href=\"Words%20of%20the%20Wind\"&gt;Words of the Wind&lt;/a&gt;\",\u00a0\"&lt;a href=\"Ashland%20Hymns\"&gt;Ashland Hymns&lt;/a&gt;\",\u00a0or\u00a0\"&lt;a href=\"The%20Five%20Far%20Stars\"&gt;The Five Far Stars&lt;/a&gt;\". These books can be bought in . It is only necessary to buy one. After receiving the gift, Hassour will gladly accept the book and will answer your questions. This also makes his &lt;a href=\"Hannat%20Zainsubani%20%28Quest%29\"&gt;personal quest&lt;/a&gt; available.\nHassour says that the Ashlanders believe that the long dead\u00a0&lt;a href=\"Chimer\"&gt;Chimer&lt;/a&gt;\u00a0general,\u00a0&lt;a href=\"Indoril%20Nerevar\"&gt;Lord Indoril Nerevar&lt;/a&gt;, will resurrect as the Nerevarine and will cast down the false gods of the\u00a0&lt;a href=\"Tribunal\"&gt;Tribunal&lt;/a&gt;\u00a0and make\u00a0&lt;a href=\"Morrowind\"&gt;Morrowind&lt;/a&gt;\u00a0worship the ancient\u00a0&lt;a href=\"Daedra\"&gt;Daedra&lt;/a&gt;,\u00a0&lt;a href=\"Boethiah\"&gt;Boethiah&lt;/a&gt;,\u00a0&lt;a href=\"Azura\"&gt;Azura&lt;/a&gt;,\u00a0and\u00a0&lt;a href=\"Mephala\"&gt;Mephala&lt;/a&gt;\u00a0once again.\nHe says that the\u00a0&lt;a href=\"Urshilaku%20Tribe%20%28Morrowind%29\"&gt;Urshilaku Tribe&lt;/a&gt;\u00a0are the most devout worshippers of the Nerevarine Cult, and that they can provide the needed information about the subject. Hassour says that the other tribes do not believe in the Nerevarine Prophecy and view it as mere superstition.\nFollowing the answers, Zainsubani will give you\u00a0&lt;a href=\"Zainsubani%27s%20Notes\"&gt;Zainsubani's Notes&lt;/a&gt;, which contains all the information that the Spymaster asked for.\nThe Nerevarine must now go to\u00a0&lt;a href=\"Balmora%20%28Morrowind%29\"&gt;Balmora&lt;/a&gt; and report to Caius.\nThe Spymaster's Revelations.\nHead\u00a0back to Caius Cosades and deliver Hassour's notes to him.

He did not shout or profess a new hero, but came in from the heat and sat wordless upon his favorite cushion, looking at his mother the whole time. \"Well,\" she questioned, \"who will you be today?\" She hardly finished before he pounced to answer. \"I will be a new hero, and they will tell of my deeds to the little children during drills!\"\nOnly then did she shed a tear."}

It is also a shrine to the Daedric Prince &lt;a href=\"Azura\"&gt;Azura&lt;/a&gt;.\nDescription.\nGeography.\nThe Cavern of the Incarnate is located on the inner end of the &lt;a href=\"Valley%20of%20the%20Wind\"&gt;Valley of the Wind&lt;/a&gt;, a dried up &lt;a href=\"foyada\"&gt;foyada&lt;/a&gt; that extends along the eastern end of the Vvardenfell Ashlands, more specifically, on the northeastern end of the Ashlands near the &lt;a href=\"Grazelands\"&gt;Grazelands&lt;/a&gt;. The cave itself is rather small, containing a small room that fits a decently-sized statue of Azura. The seawater was flowing from the &lt;a href=\"Sea%20of%20Ghosts\"&gt;Sheogorad Strait&lt;/a&gt; had leaked into the Cavern of the Incarnate, creating pools of water around the shrine. Stalactites and stalagmites jut throughout the cavern which makes sense considering its proximity to Red Mountain. The cave is well hidden in the area and is seldom visited by pilgrims.\nHistory.\n&lt;a href=\"Second%20Era\"&gt;Second Era&lt;/a&gt;.\nDuring the &lt;a href=\"Interregnum\"&gt;Interregnum&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"2E%20583\"&gt;2E 583&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"Ashkhan\"&gt;Ashkhan&lt;/a&gt; of the &lt;a href=\"Urshilaku%20Tribe\"&gt;Urshilaku Tribe&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Conoon%20Chodala\"&gt;Conoon Chodala&lt;/a&gt;, believed that he was in fact the &lt;a href=\"Nerevarine\"&gt;Nerevarine&lt;/a&gt;. Conoon Chodala's belief in this was very dangerous, not only for all the Ashlanders in Vvardenfell but it can take a toll on his health. The Gulakhan of the Urshilaku, &lt;a href=\"Seryn%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Seryn&lt;/a&gt; along with &lt;a href=\"Wise%20Woman%20Dovrosi\"&gt;Wise Woman Dovrosi&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"Ald%27ruhn\"&gt;Ald'ruhn&lt;/a&gt; and an adventurer known as the &lt;a href=\"Vestige\"&gt;Vestige&lt;/a&gt;, traveled to the Cavern of the Incarnate. This was to commune with the Failed Incarnates and &lt;a href=\"Azura\"&gt;Azura&lt;/a&gt; to convince Chodala otherwise. The Failed Incarnates spoke with the Vestige, telling them their stories and what made them perish in the first place. With the knowledge in hand, the three returned to Ald'ruhn and convened with Chodala in the meeting room. Their endeavor had failed, resulting in Chodala attacking the settlement with the help of the &lt;a href=\"Red%20Exiles\"&gt;Red Exiles&lt;/a&gt;. Chodala was eventually killed by the Vestige after he escaped into &lt;a href=\"Azura%27s%20Coast\"&gt;Azura's Coast&lt;/a&gt;.\n&lt;a href=\"Third%20Era\"&gt;Third Era&lt;/a&gt;.\nDuring the &lt;a href=\"Vvardenfell%20Crisis\"&gt;Vvardenfell Crisis&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"3E%20427\"&gt;3E 427&lt;/a&gt;, the true &lt;a href=\"Nerevarine\"&gt;Nerevarine&lt;/a&gt; had risen from the shadows, on their quest to fulfill the &lt;a href=\"Nerevarine%20Prophecy\"&gt;Nerevarine Prophecy&lt;/a&gt;. The Nerevarine convened with the Urshilaku Tribe and the Ashkhan of Urshilaku, &lt;a href=\"Sul-Matuul\"&gt;Sul-Matuul&lt;/a&gt;. The Ashkhan had given the Nerevarine a riddle that needed to be deciphered so that the hero can find the Cavern of the Incarnate. Through some investigation, the Nerevarine had discovered the location of the Cavern and traveled to the area, to converse with Azura. It was there the traveler obtained the &lt;a href=\"Moon-and-Star\"&gt;Moon-and-Star&lt;/a&gt; and they were officially named the Nerevarine of Prophecy. In the cavern, the Nerevarine had talked with the different Failed Incarnates including Conoon Chodala and &lt;a href=\"Peakstar\"&gt;Peakstar&lt;/a&gt;.

He was elected by popular consensus following the death of &lt;a href=\"Uriel%20Septim%20III\"&gt;Uriel Septim III&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"3E%20127\"&gt;3E 127&lt;/a&gt;.

Prior to his becoming Emperor, he lived in &lt;a href=\"Gilane\"&gt;Gilane&lt;/a&gt; with his bride, the &lt;a href=\"Redguard\"&gt;Redguard&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Queen%20Bianki\"&gt;Queen Bianki&lt;/a&gt;. Together they had multiple children who perished during the &lt;a href=\"War%20of%20the%20Red%20Diamond\"&gt;War of the Red Diamond&lt;/a&gt;.\nKing of Gilane.\nCephorus married &lt;a href=\"Bianki\"&gt;Bianki&lt;/a&gt;, Queen of &lt;a href=\"Gilane\"&gt;Gilane&lt;/a&gt;, at some point prior to 3E 98, making him King of Gilane. The pair were stalwart supporters of &lt;a href=\"Kintyra%20Septim%20II\"&gt;Kintyra Septim II&lt;/a&gt; and opposed her rival &lt;a href=\"Uriel%20Septim%20III\"&gt;Uriel Septim III&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;a href=\"War%20of%20the%20Red%20Diamond\"&gt;War of the Red Diamond&lt;/a&gt;. In the year 3E 125, Cephorus conquered western High Rock which resulted in Uriel marching to meet him before being defeated by Cephorus in the &lt;a href=\"Battle%20of%20Ichidag\"&gt;Battle of Ichidag&lt;/a&gt;. Uriel was captured and sent to the city of Gilane to be tried. On the way, however, Uriel was killed by vigilantes, and Cephorus rode to the &lt;a href=\"Imperial%20City\"&gt;Imperial City&lt;/a&gt; where he was coronated.\nEmperor.\nCephorus' reign was marked by war as Potema Septim, his sister and Uriel's mother, was still alive and opposed his rule. It took him nearly ten years to defeat the so-called Wolf Queen of &lt;a href=\"Solitude\"&gt;Solitude&lt;/a&gt;, former-Queen Potema, who died during the siege of her city-state in &lt;a href=\"3E%20137\"&gt;3E 137&lt;/a&gt;. Cephorus died only three years later at the age of 63 when he fell from the horse he was riding. Because all of his children with Queen Bianki died during the War of the Red Diamond, the throne passed instead to his brother, the fourth child of &lt;a href=\"Pelagius%20Septim\"&gt;Pelagius Septim&lt;/a&gt;, Magnus Septim."}

Eventually, Cephorus conceded the &lt;a href=\"High%20Rock\"&gt;High Rock&lt;/a&gt; kingdom of &lt;a href=\"Shornhelm\"&gt;Shornhelm&lt;/a&gt; to Andorak, and the conflict was concluded, although Sage Eraintine described it by stating that \"&lt;a href=\"Tiber%20Septim\"&gt;Tiber Septim&lt;/a&gt;'s heart is beating no more.\"\nCamoran Usurper.\nThe second significant event of Cephorus' reign was the invasion and skirmishes of the &lt;a href=\"Camoran%20Usurper\"&gt;Camoran Usurper&lt;/a&gt;. Camoran was supposedly an &lt;a href=\"undead\"&gt;undead&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"lich\"&gt;lich&lt;/a&gt; who gathered a huge army of combined undead and &lt;a href=\"Daedric\"&gt;Daedric&lt;/a&gt; forces, and launched an assault across all of Tamriel, beginning in &lt;a href=\"Valenwood\"&gt;Valenwood&lt;/a&gt;. His armies tore across cities and countryside\u2014seemingly undefeatable. At first, the offense was merely a rebuke to what seemed an indestructible Empire. Cephorus' initial reaction was to send a group of mercenaries to meet Camoran's forces in &lt;a href=\"Hammerfell\"&gt;Hammerfell&lt;/a&gt;, however they were bribed, turned into undead, or slaughtered.\nLater life and death.\nSoon, Camoran had taken the region of &lt;a href=\"Dwynnen\"&gt;Dwynnen&lt;/a&gt; with a composite army of &lt;a href=\"ghost\"&gt;ghost&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"zombie\"&gt;zombie&lt;/a&gt;s and &lt;a href=\"vampires\"&gt;vampires&lt;/a&gt;, as well as parts of Hammerfell. He eventually met a naval force in the region of &lt;a href=\"Iliac%20Bay\"&gt;Iliac Bay&lt;/a&gt; near High Rock province. With an almost endless army of mighty Daedra and undead, Camoran still managed to lose the battle. The reports of the event are vague, making some simply speculate it was divine intervention. However it was established that the weather played a large part in Camoran's seemingly impossible defeat. Cephorus Septim died in 3E 268. He was succeeded by his son &lt;a href=\"Uriel%20Septim%20V\"&gt;Uriel Septim V&lt;/a&gt;."}

The more I translate, the less sure I am. Note the use of the word I translated as \"(&lt;a href=\"Skills%20%28Online%29\"&gt;skill&lt;/a&gt;)\" in the second excerpt. The word could also be used to reference a physical edge, like that of a &lt;a href=\"Swords%20%28Online%29\"&gt;sword&lt;/a&gt;. That, combined with the talk about cutting and severing, and the whole mention of the bond-brother, has led me to think that this might be referring to an actual &lt;a href=\"Weapons%20%28Online%29\"&gt;weapon&lt;/a&gt;.\nMuch of the context is missing, and the unusual style and structure has made translation even more challenging than usual. I must be overlooking something, but most of the text in this chamber is severely damaged, and I fear I may never attain a complete understanding.\n\"... eight-times-gifted and heavy with the weight of justice. The first blood you found flowed from the Jumping Wolf. You severed his hand, and then his other, issuing him rewards for murder and making him to crawl along the ground as a common slave.

You were aloft over them with your two mighty hands in prayer, and they cowered and begged as you fed them to darkness bone by bone. Your bond-brother (exalted) you and you pulled the stars down at his command to burn their tents, and together you laughed as you drove them before you.\"\n\"Oh! Glory and (unknown)! Your story of violence rings through three worlds, cuts the glittering path between. You are name-stealer, destroying the legend of what stood before you. You are forged from starlight and honed with &lt;a href=\"Man\"&gt;Man&lt;/a&gt;'s bone. You are only for the worthy.\"\nI'm running out of coin to pay my guards, so I'll need to move on soon. I never managed to discover how to open the door to the innermost chamber; I shall have to return. I'm taking rubbings of all the fragments I can find. There's no way they can deny me further funding with this discovery -- what if some untouched artifact waits inside?"}

In its prime, Ceyatatar was a flourishing trading city that benefitted from the &lt;a href=\"White-Gold%20Tower\"&gt;White-Gold Tower&lt;/a&gt; of the Ayleids.\nDescription.\nGeography.\nCeyatatar is situated alongside the &lt;a href=\"Gold%20Road\"&gt;Gold Road&lt;/a&gt;, between the city-states of &lt;a href=\"Skingrad\"&gt;Skingrad&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Red%20Ring%20Road\"&gt;Red Ring Road&lt;/a&gt;. In fact, it is right off the trail and overlooking the area. The ruins sport the typical exterior layout, with long bridges exceeding out and an &lt;a href=\"Ayleid%20Well\"&gt;Ayleid Well&lt;/a&gt; in the middle of a foundation. Around the center are walls that circle around the ruins. The entrance to the Ceyatatar ruins is located on the western bridge, on the other side. Because the Ayleids revere the traditional &lt;a href=\"High%20Elven\"&gt;High Elven&lt;/a&gt; religion, which consists of water, earth, air and light, the entire ruin is enlightened by globes and pools of magic. Like other Ayleid ruins, these cities were used for torturing their imprisoned slaves, the &lt;a href=\"Nede\"&gt;Nede&lt;/a&gt;. And so, the ruins of Ceyatatar hold various traps. In the inner sanctum called Ceyatatar Gorihame, there lies the &lt;a href=\"Welkynd%20Stone\"&gt;Welkynd Stone&lt;/a&gt;s, crystals created out of &lt;a href=\"Meteoric%20Glass\"&gt;Meteoric Glass&lt;/a&gt;, which is a rare form of &lt;a href=\"Aetherial%20Fragments\"&gt;Aetherial Fragments&lt;/a&gt;. Every Ayleid ruin contains a Welkynd Stone and each holds immense power.\nHistory.\n&lt;a href=\"First%20Era\"&gt;First Era&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe city-state of Ceyatatar was ruled by &lt;a href=\"Fire%20King%20Hadhuul\"&gt;Fire King Hadhuul&lt;/a&gt;, who was well-known for his master in using &lt;a href=\"Spear\"&gt;Spear&lt;/a&gt;s. Nobody was able to withstand the might of Hadhuul's spears. Like many Ayleid cities, the Nedes were tortured, but Hadhuul's methods were considered the worst throughout the land. Hadhuul would drug his slaves from an admixture of Daedrons, which bring about horrible visions. The children were set ablaze and hunted for sport by the Ayleid pet tigers. During Hadhuul's reign, Ceyatatar was a bustling trading city, rivaling the likes of &lt;a href=\"Ancient%20Bravil\"&gt;Ancient Bravil&lt;/a&gt; and nearby &lt;a href=\"Silvenar%20%28City%29\"&gt;Silvenar&lt;/a&gt;. It was because of the establishment of the &lt;a href=\"White-Gold%20Tower\"&gt;White-Gold Tower&lt;/a&gt;, cities like Ceyatatar were able to prosper, but that would come to an end. With the &lt;a href=\"Alessian%20Slave%20Rebellion\"&gt;Alessian Slave Rebellion&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Pelinal%20Whitestrake\"&gt;Pelinal Whitestrake&lt;/a&gt; roamed the land, slaying the various Ayleid kings and freeing his people, being under the command of &lt;a href=\"Saint%20Alessia\"&gt;Saint Alessia&lt;/a&gt;. After defeating &lt;a href=\"Gordhaur%20the%20Shaper\"&gt;Gordhaur the Shaper&lt;/a&gt; at &lt;a href=\"Ninendava\"&gt;Ninendava&lt;/a&gt;, Pelinal challenged Fire King Hadhuul and defeated him on the granite steps of Ceya-Tar. It was the first time Hadhuul's spears were unable to kill the opponent. Ceyatatar was sacked and ruined for the rest of the eras.\n&lt;a href=\"Second%20Era\"&gt;Second Era&lt;/a&gt;.\nDuring the &lt;a href=\"Interregnum\"&gt;Interregnum&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"2E%20582\"&gt;2E 582&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"Alliance%20War\"&gt;Alliance War&lt;/a&gt; had ravaged the entirety of the province of &lt;a href=\"Cyrodiil\"&gt;Cyrodiil&lt;/a&gt;, with only the &lt;a href=\"Gold%20Coast\"&gt;Gold Coast&lt;/a&gt; remaining in relative peace. The township of &lt;a href=\"Vlastarus\"&gt;Vlastarus&lt;/a&gt; was one of the few settlements within Cyrodiil that managed itself without an Empire, having to deal with problems of their own. During the war, Vlastarus and Ceyatatar were in what was considered territory of the &lt;a href=\"First%20Aldmeri%20Dominion\"&gt;First Aldmeri Dominion&lt;/a&gt;, so soldiers of the Dominion would frequent the area. Fire King Hadhuul's spirit remained in Ceyatatar, with &lt;a href=\"Flame%20Atronach\"&gt;Flame Atronach&lt;/a&gt;s serving as his bodyguards. The townsfolk of Vlastarus would occasionally be terrorized by the Atronachs and so they sent travelers to deal with them, along with collecting flame essence. Hadhuul's spirit was quelled and the town was left in peace. From that point on, the ruins would be used the local bandits and conjurers of the land, utilizing it as a redoubt for whatever purpose."}

Chain Lightning has the unique ability to bounce or \"arc\" off of surfaces or characters to hit a target behind or around an obstacle. This spell may arc to &lt;a href=\"Followers%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;followers&lt;/a&gt; if they are too close to the impact location.\nDamage capacity.\nChain lightning delivers a minimum of 40 points of damage to the target, or 60 points if the &lt;a href=\"Last%20Dragonborn\"&gt;Dragonborn&lt;/a&gt; has Augmented Shock x 2. Chain lightning deals damage to a target's &lt;a href=\"Magicka%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Magicka&lt;/a&gt; equal to half the damage done to health, so 20 to 30 points is done to magicka.\nUsefulness.\nThis spell is effective against multiple low &lt;a href=\"level\"&gt;level&lt;/a&gt; and low &lt;a href=\"Health%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;health&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Creatures%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;enemies&lt;/a&gt; such as &lt;a href=\"Skeever%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;skeevers&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Skeleton%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;skeletons&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Mage%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;novice mages&lt;/a&gt;. It almost always kills the group of enemies in one cast under this condition. Because this spell strikes multiple clustered targets, followers can be struck and killed by Chain Lightning.\nAlso, Chain lightning continues to arc even if the initial cast misses. This allows it to hit targets around corners that the caster does not have a direct line of sight to. It can also bypass the ward of a mage if it is shot behind the mage and arcs to hit the mage from behind."}

Up to 30% can be achieved by using a &lt;a href=\"Sigil%20Stone%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;Sigil Stone&lt;/a&gt; obtained from an Oblivion Gate.\nAt high levels, rings can be found with chameleon enchantments of up to 30%.\nUsefulness.\nChameleon's spell effect decreases the chance that the user will be detected. Even with very high magnitudes, the user will easily be detected if not &lt;a href=\"Sneak%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;sneaking&lt;/a&gt;, so it is primarily useful to enhance sneaking beyond what the Hero's skill level provides. Getting a total chameleon effect of 100% or greater will grant total invisibility, which works even when not sneaking (with limited exceptions; see below).\n100% Chameleon.\nA powerful exploit is to enchant several pieces of equipment to provide a cumulative 100% chameleon effect. When equipped, this will make the Hero undetectable to nearly everything. Stealing or trespassing can be done almost with impunity.\nWhen attacked by an invisible foe, most NPCs will either run to the nearest guard or ignore it and stand still. On occasion, they will draw their weapons or move towards the attacker, but they won't attack. Likewise, attacking people in public will no longer draw attention from guards. However, attacking a guard will earn an automatic bounty. When in a &lt;a href=\"Oblivion%20%28Realm%29\"&gt;Plane of Oblivion&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Dremora%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;Dremora&lt;/a&gt; soldiers can be &lt;a href=\"pickpocket\"&gt;pickpocket&lt;/a&gt;ed without being detected. Even if the Dremora \"catches\" the Hero, they will ignore them, and can be repeatedly pickpocketed for all of their items. 100% Chameleon will not prevent the\u00a0Hero from talking to characters normally, and characters who are scripted to walk up to the\u00a0Hero\u00a0and initiate conversation will still do so. However, they will remain unaware of the\u00a0Hero both before and after the conversation (for example, &lt;a href=\"Highwayman%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;Highwaymen&lt;/a&gt; may still try to shake the\u00a0Hero\u00a0down on the road, but will not initiate combat afterward).\nThere are some circumstances where the\u00a0Hero\u00a0can be detected. Although pickpocketing ability is greatly enhanced, failure is still possible. If a non-Dremora character catches the\u00a0Hero pickpocketing, they will detect them despite chameleon, and the\u00a0Hero\u00a0will remain detected until they leave the area, remove the armor, wait a few hours, and replace it. Talking to the guards with an outstanding bounty will prompt them to attack, and they will also be able to see through the chameleon until the\u00a0Hero\u00a0hides, and removes and replaces the armor. When trespassing, some characters can still detect the\u00a0Hero\u00a0and request them to leave. After a time, the trespass will become a crime and a bounty will be added, followed by a guard initiating conversation to collect the fine. However, refusing to pay will not make the guard aggressive as he cannot see through the disguise and the\u00a0Hero will be free to leave (though the bounty will remain).\nUsing this exploit is not the same as invisibility. Traps will still affect the\u00a0Hero; most notably, the fire shooting traps in a Plane of Oblivion will still track them and fire at them. However, since traps don't move, and can usually be avoided or disarmed, an observant\u00a0Hero\u00a0should have no difficulty defeating most challenges, and should be able to do so much more quickly than without the chameleon effect."}

It is unlocked once the player character achieves level 50. A champion point is awarded every 400,000 XP gained and can be used to unlock and improve passive skills from 3 constellations. Note that champion points can be spent differently for each character on any one account. However, only level 50 characters may earn points. If at any point you should want to change the way your points are distributed you can have all of them refunded for a flat rate of 3,000 gold.\nAs of &lt;a href=\"Update%2016\"&gt;Update 16&lt;/a&gt;, the maximum total Champion Points was raised from 660\u2013690.

Enlightenment will eventually run out but it can be restored when you're not logged on.\nThe Constellations.\nThe champion system involves three constellations: The Mage, The Warrior, and The Thief. These constellations each represent aspects of power. Each champion point earned is earned in a rotating fashion. This means that the first one earned will be for The Warrior, the next one will be for The Thief, the next for The Mage, and so on in that order. After a certain number of points have been spent in each minor constellation a unique passive will be unlocked; however, these passives cannot be upgraded. Unique passives are unlocked every 10, 30, 75, and 120 points spent in a constellation. In addition, a max of 100 points can be put into each passive skill, or star, of each minor constellation.\nThe Warrior.\nThe Warrior constellations focus on improving a player's defensive and healing capabilities. One point is earned for The Warrior every three champion points earned.\nThe Lord.\n\"Under The Warrior's influence, The Lord grants you health and improves your vitality.\"\nThe Lord is a minor constellation located within The Warrior.

Killing Astrid instead of the three captives will fail \"With Friends Like These...\" and begin this quest in its place. \nReport Astrid's death.\nAfter killing Astrid, the Dragonborn will be directed to report to any guard with the information that they have killed a Dark Brotherhood assassin (the closest guards may be found in &lt;a href=\"Morthal%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Morthal&lt;/a&gt;, south of the shack). The guard will tell them to report to Commander Maro, who resides at the &lt;a href=\"Penitus%20Oculatus%20Outpost\"&gt;Penitus Oculatus Outpost&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Dragon%20Bridge%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Dragon Bridge&lt;/a&gt;.\nMaro says that he has been tracking the Dark Brotherhood and waiting for an opportunity to attack. On hearing news of the death of their leader, he tasks the Dragonborn with infiltrating the &lt;a href=\"Dark%20Brotherhood%20Sanctuary%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Dark Brotherhood Sanctuary&lt;/a&gt;, using the password his agents recently acquired, and slaying every assassin inside.\nKill everyone in the Sanctuary.\nTravel to the Sanctuary, southwest of &lt;a href=\"Falkreath%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Falkreath&lt;/a&gt;. To complete the quest, the Dragonborn must kill &lt;a href=\"Nazir\"&gt;Nazir&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Gabriella\"&gt;Gabriella&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Arnbjorn\"&gt;Arnbjorn&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Festus%20Krex\"&gt;Festus Krex&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Veezara\"&gt;Veezara&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe pet of the sanctuary, the &lt;a href=\"Frostbite%20Spider%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;frostbite spider&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Lis\"&gt;Lis&lt;/a&gt;, does not have to be killed, but it will become hostile if it spots the Dragonborn.\nThe assassins can be powerful, and collectively possess a range of attacks that make fighting several of them together in the cramped space fairly difficult. The use of &lt;a href=\"Bows%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;bows&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Invisibility%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;invisibility&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Poison%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;poisons&lt;/a&gt; are effective ways to take care of them.\u00a0\nReport back to Commander Maro.\nWhen the job is done, the Dragonborn must report back to Commander Maro to complete the quest and collect the reward of 3,000 . Once the quest is complete, the Dark Brotherhood Sanctuary will remain accessible and undamaged, in contrast to finishing the Dark Brotherhood questline when most of it is destroyed."}

Many creatures in \"Oblivion\" are weak to either Shock or Fire damage. Destruction is the best way to take out multiple opponents. Spells can be made to affect a wide area hitting several opponents per spell.\nOne of the most useful spells in the game (although many consider it a form of \"cheating\") is to create a 100-point, 1-second Touch &lt;a href=\"Drain%20Health%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;Drain Health&lt;/a&gt; spell. It costs very little to actually cast, and, until the character is around level 25, will instantly kill almost every enemy you encounter. Carry a back-up plan if using this, though, as some enemies are immune."}

The Destruction skill is increased by damaging enemies with Destruction spells. Destruction spells serve as the main offensive for &lt;a href=\"Magic\"&gt;mages&lt;/a&gt;, as the majority of the spells in this school cause direct damage.\nDestruction spells can be acquired by reading spell tomes bought from vendors or looted from chests and corpses. The &lt;a href=\"Spell%20Tomes%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;tomes&lt;/a&gt; of these spells depict an open palm, circled in fire. In the &lt;a href=\"College%20of%20Winterhold%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;College of Winterhold&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Faralda%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Faralda&lt;/a&gt; is the Destruction Teacher and has a wide selection of Destruction spell tomes for sale.\nBranches.\nDestruction is divided in three types of elements: Fire, Frost and Shock. Each has its own characteristics, costs and effects, as listed below.\nFire.\n&lt;a href=\"Fire%20Damage%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Fire spells&lt;/a&gt; consume the least amount of magicka of the three types of Destruction spells. Fire spells travel at an average velocity and inflict damage on contact as well as over time. Most fire spells inflict a \"burn\" effect on enemies, which boosts damage from other weapons. &lt;a href=\"Dunmer%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Dark Elves&lt;/a&gt; are 50% &lt;a href=\"Resist%20Fire%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;resistant to this kind of spell&lt;/a&gt;, which can be helpful in fighting fire-breathing dragons. Fire spells also boil small amounts of water when cast at them. Fire spells can also ignite oil that is sometimes found spilled on the floor of dungeons, crypts, etc. Creatures (including the &lt;a href=\"Last%20Dragonborn\"&gt;Dragonborn&lt;/a&gt; and their companions) standing in or passing through burning oil will take fire damage.\nFrost.\n&lt;a href=\"Frost%20Damage%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Frost spells&lt;/a&gt; consume an average amount of Magicka, but they travel at a slower velocity than shock spells. Frost spells slow the target's movement, while dealing damage to health and stamina. &lt;a href=\"Nords%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Nords&lt;/a&gt; are 50% &lt;a href=\"Resist%20Frost%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;resistant to this kind of spell&lt;/a&gt;, which can be an advantage when fighting frost-breathing dragons. Also, &lt;a href=\"Vampirism%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;vampires&lt;/a&gt; resist between 25% and 100% (20% and 50% in ) of frost damage, depending on the stage of vampirism.\nShock.\n&lt;a href=\"Shock%20Damage%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Shock spells&lt;/a&gt; consume the most Magicka of the three types of Destruction spells, but its spell velocity is instant. Shock spell damage drains health and magicka, making it an ideal choice against mages. Only &lt;a href=\"Bretons%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Bretons&lt;/a&gt;, with a 25% resistance to all magic, have an innate resistance to shock spell damage. Shock damage is not conducted by water.\nSkill Books.\nThe following is a list of books that raise the Destruction skill.\nQuests.\nThe following miscellaneous quests increases the Destruction Skill:\nSpells.\nThe following is a complete list of Destruction spells:\nMaster (skill level 100).\nMaster spells cannot be purchased initially. To unlock Master Destruction spells, the quest \"&lt;a href=\"Destruction%20Ritual%20Spell\"&gt;Destruction Ritual Spell&lt;/a&gt;\" must be completed upon reaching level 100 Destruction.\nStarting spells.\nThe following are Destruction spells that the Dragonborn can start with if the correct race is selected:\nPerks.\nThe following are the perks that become available to select as the skill is leveled up. 17 Perk points are required to max out the tree.\n&lt;onlyinclude&gt;\n&lt;/onlyinclude&gt;\nEnhancing destruction damage.\nLeveling up destruction does not increase damage and mages may find that destruction is less useful against high level enemies. There are four ways to increase destruction damage."}

In the ruins is a pedestal that, when activated, places the book onto itself. Casting a fire spell at the pedestal or attacking it with a bow with a fire enchantment (\"at this stand wield mage's craft so fierce the sea will \"boil\"\") will trigger another page of text to appear, this time giving slightly less vague directions to ruins in the south of Skyrim near the &lt;a href=\"Throat%20of%20the%20World%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Throat of the World&lt;/a&gt;.\n&lt;poem&gt;Under Greybeards' morning shadow\nAt this northern watch, long lost\n&lt;a href=\"Nirn\"&gt;Nirn&lt;/a&gt;'s hoary Throat does scrape the sky.\nHere unleash a chilling cry \nAnd gild this stand with frost.&lt;/poem&gt;\nNorth Skybound Watch.\nGo to &lt;a href=\"North%20Skybound%20Watch\"&gt;North Skybound Watch&lt;/a&gt;, on the southwestern edge of the Throat of the World, due southeast of &lt;a href=\"Riverwood%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Riverwood&lt;/a&gt;. If not already discovered, start at &lt;a href=\"Helgen\"&gt;Helgen&lt;/a&gt; and head east. North Skybound Watch is located north of the road running between Helgen and &lt;a href=\"Ivarstead%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Ivarstead&lt;/a&gt;. On the way from Helgen, there is a path on the left side of the road before the &lt;a href=\"Falkreath%20Stormcloak%20Camp\"&gt;Falkreath Stormcloak Camp&lt;/a&gt;. This path leads to &lt;a href=\"Orphan%20Rock\"&gt;Orphan Rock&lt;/a&gt;; while North Skybound Watch is past it and to the northwest. After walking through the door and placing the book, cast a frost spell at the pedestal, which reads, \"here unleash a \"chilling\" cry and gild this stand with \"frost\",\" before picking the book back up. The next page directs the Dragonborn to a location around &lt;a href=\"Karthspire\"&gt;Karthspire&lt;/a&gt;:\n&lt;poem&gt;Over western river waters,\nBy Karth bounded, south and north\nOn mountains sits a humble crown.\nSky's wrath on this stand bring forth\nTo shake these snowcaps down.&lt;/poem&gt;\nFour Skull Lookout.\nTravel to &lt;a href=\"Four%20Skull%20Lookout%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Four Skull Lookout&lt;/a&gt;, directly south of &lt;a href=\"Karthwasten%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Karthwasten&lt;/a&gt; (if you have not discovered it yet). Place the book and cast a shock spell at the pedestal (\"\"sky's wrath\" on this stand bring forth to shake the snowcaps down\").\nFinally, take the book back and read it. This awards the Destruction spell &lt;a href=\"Fire%20Storm%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Fire Storm&lt;/a&gt; and more text in the book, this time a grim-sounding message from &lt;a href=\"Shalidor\"&gt;Shalidor&lt;/a&gt;.\n&lt;poem&gt;Elemental magic wielded,\nElemental thoughts displayed.\nHavoc wrought as if for sport,\nEfforts to impress fall short.\nI'll merely use a blade.\nSeeking study, wanting learning,\nRecklessly aroused my rage!\nMy pupil you would be, or more?\nPresume not of Shalidor,\nYou feeble, foolish mage!\nQuickly dispatched, worthless weakling,\nThough this tome I gladly claim.\nA diamond in the rough, I find,\nShining gem from feeble mind.\nNow die, and curse my name!&lt;/poem&gt;"}

Those who embrace this argument prefer to spend time researching obscure theoretical topics instead of the more practical applications of magic.\nIn truth, these pedants accomplish little beyond writing tomes of their own to refute the postulations of their contempories, wasting their time arguing hypotheticals with no basis in practical magical study. They are so distracted trying to outwit one another in their imaginary field that they never produce substantial advancements. It is my conviction that this self-indulgent behaviour obstructs progress (concrete gains such as spell discovery) in arcane studies.\nI do not deny that magic is deep and complex, and our understanding is far from complete.\nHowever, I question the value of arguments over theories with very little basis in observable phenomena before we fully grasp less complicated subjects. In my years of practice, I have found that studying manifestations of magicka that seem the simplest often provides the clearest look at the nature of magic. Without a complete understanding of what seems to be basic, how can anyone advance magic and bring benefit to practitioners and &lt;a href=\"Tamriel\"&gt;Tamriel&lt;/a&gt; at large? I implore you, reader, to take care that you do not fall into the category of the fruitless intellectual."}

With having a development team of roughly seventy people, it's the largest development team for any game.\nWhile being similar in size to Oblivion's setting, &lt;a href=\"Cyrodiil\"&gt;Cyrodiil&lt;/a&gt;, the team opted for a different approach to \"Skyrim\". As said by Skyrim's Art Director, Matt Carofano:\"In Skyrim we've come up with something we internally call 'epic reality.' And what that means to us is; dramatic views wherever you go.\"\nAccording to &lt;a href=\"Todd%20Howard\"&gt;Todd Howard&lt;/a&gt;, contrary to 's setting; &lt;a href=\"Morrowind\"&gt;Morrowind&lt;/a&gt;, Skyrim shouldn't feel like an isolated, alien place. There were, however, similarities between \"Morrowind\" and \"Skyrim\". Much like the differences in treatment between two of the &lt;a href=\"Great%20Houses\"&gt;Great Houses&lt;/a&gt; of Morrowind; &lt;a href=\"House%20Redoran\"&gt;House Redoran&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"House%20Telvanni\"&gt;House Telvanni&lt;/a&gt;, this is also seen between the various &lt;a href=\"Holds\"&gt;Holds&lt;/a&gt; in Skyrim.\nThe music for \"Skyrim\" was composed by &lt;a href=\"Jeremy%20Soule\"&gt;Jeremy Soule&lt;/a&gt;, who had composed the music for both \"Morrowind\" and \"Oblivion\". Skyrim's main theme, , was recorded with a choir consisting of thirty men. To fit the Nordic atmosphere of Skyrim, Todd Howard had the idea that the music for Skyrim would be the Elder Scrolls theme, but sung by a barbarian choir. He had asked Emil Pagliarulo, a Senior Game Designer for Bethesda Softworks, the following: \"\"Can you write a song that works in the &lt;a href=\"Dragon%20language\"&gt;Dragon language&lt;/a&gt;, that rhymes with the Elder Scrolls theme, when translated into English also makes sense and rhymes?\"\" According to Audio Director Mark Lampert, the main theme set the tone for the rest of the game.\nWhile in earlier Bethesda games such as , , but also \"Oblivion\" the team had used generated landscape, this wasn't done in \"The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim\". The dungeons in \"Oblivion\", for example, were all designed by one person. While \"Skyrim\"'s &lt;a href=\"dungeons\"&gt;dungeons&lt;/a&gt; were designed by a team of eight."}
{"id": "1032078", "revid": "7075644", "url": "https://elderscrolls.fandom.com/wiki?curid=1032078", "title": "Development of the Hollow", "text": "Development of the Hollow is a &lt;a href=\"Books%20%28Murkmire%29\"&gt;book&lt;/a&gt; in .\nContents.\nOur &lt;a href=\"Hist\"&gt;Hist&lt;/a&gt; recognizes the waste, the selfishness of the other tribes. They enjoy a plentiful existence in their sun-kissed lands. Their Hist want for nothing and neither do they. Even their eggs are in such excess supply that their Hist has no use for them. Whole nests cast aside. Forgotten. They've never known the pain of having entire clutches swallowed by the leviathans of the deep mire. They forget that withered roots swell with life given the right care. I will find a purpose for these hollow shells and our Hist will again wind its roots around a bountiful clutch.\nFailures. Many failures. It was to be expected. Breathing true life into these hollow eggs will not be so simple as coaxing discarded flesh to remember the act of living.\nThe Black-Tongue elixirs goad the eggs' growth, but it is a wild, uncontrolled thing. Tumorous lumps of primordial flesh are a far cry from what I seek, but they are life. What it needs is a guide. I know what must be done.\nI see the beginnings of what could have been Saxhleel. At first a tooth, or a scale, or a spine among the formless masses that hatch from the eggs. The sap knows what to do, but elements are still missing. In time I will know the answer to this puzzle.\nI have created life. Short-lived, but life all the same. The Saxhleel that hatched are malformed and few survived beyond a matter of hours, but I am on the correct path.\nAs I hatch more and more of these eggs, I now understand just how far I am from what I seek. Every peak I overcome reveals a mountain taller than the last. Advancing the growth of the hatchlings has given them the constitution to endure, but even as I eliminate many of their physical deformities, it becomes clear that they are hollow. Saxhleel only in form. I must remind myself that each one brings me one step closer to the goal.\nWe have had to cage the Hollow that survive their hatching. Some possess an instinct, if not an intellect. They seem drawn to something we can't see and respond with hostility to any interference. Even the lame ones require far too much diligence to adequately watch. I suspect I've lost more than one already, but I can hardly keep track of so many failures.\nI will count today a triumph, if not a victory. Combining Veeskhleel rituals with my alchemy has produced a healthy Saxhleel. It is docile compared to the Hollow, but there is little recognition in its eyes. I can sense its soul, but I cannot tell if the possession was flawed or the body remains unfit for inhabitation.\nI have a stable formula, but I've made no progress adapting my rituals and my previous success has not developed any improved awareness. I have sunken too deep in the mire along this path. It's time to step back and explore other paths.\nI lost quite a few eggs testing the limits of my elixirs, but more are coming and the cost was worth it. Two have produced Saxhleel, the likes of which I've never seen. Unlike the other Hollow, they are far from pale. Their markings are brilliantly colored, and their skin exudes elements of my mixtures that are quite fatal, even to us. I've had them sequestered for safe study.\nI have high hopes for this new formula. The egg's growth is beyond all expectations. I can only hope that the soul binding rituals bore similar results."}

I'm eager to see this new temple for myself. I hear they built it on the water. Perhaps it floats! Once one has glimpsed &lt;a href=\"Baar%20Dau%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Baar Dau&lt;/a&gt;, the idea hardly seems farfetched.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Buoyant%20Armigers%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Buoyant Armigers&lt;/a&gt; are a sight to see. Their numbers patrol many of the paths of pilgrimage and they always seem to have something of a spring in their step. Their songs and swords are a comfort for any otherwise inhospitable road.\nIt doesn't float, but that doesn't make Molag Mar any less marvelous! This will be a wonderful place to recuperate and prepare for the journey to &lt;a href=\"Mount%20Kand\"&gt;Mount Kand&lt;/a&gt;. But first, I must offer my devotions to the &lt;a href=\"Tribunal%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Three&lt;/a&gt; at the temple.\nI've seen fewer of the Buoyant Armigers around in the last day or so. Gone off to mind the roads, I suppose. When I asked their senior here when I might find an escort on my journey, she frowned. Some incident at the glass mine has them busy. She claims no one can be spared.\nI've waited long enough. The Armigers may be busy, but I'm sure their presence here has made the wilderness a little tamer. Tomorrow morning I'll continue my journey!"}

Alternatively, one does not actually need to steal a diamond, as any diamond obtained in any way, including found or bought, will work.\nOnce the diamond is obtained, return to Sugar-Lips Habasi to complete the quest, and receive the reward."}

I dare not write where we stay for fear of endangering the good people of this house should this diary be discovered. We have been shown a kindness by this family once known to the &lt;a href=\"Snow%20Prince\"&gt;Snow Prince&lt;/a&gt;. Even in death his great influence has ensured our safety. We were separated from many of our kin along the road when it became increasingly difficult to travel discreetly in our numbers. We were forced to go our separate ways and travel only at night. I have heard no news of where the others may have gone and fear I never shall. Our lives are forever changed.\n\"Seventh Marking\" Tenth Kulniir\"\" In the night I find it difficult not to focus on times past. There are moments in my rest when I still hear the laughing of young ones at play in the valley. Other times I see the pale fleckes of happy moments which were once so common in the land of the &lt;a href=\"Snow%20Elves\"&gt;Snow Elves&lt;/a&gt;. I try not to dwell on these memories too long. Often the surroundings make it impossible to dwell on any happiness. We have been locked together in such close quarters for so long. We grow tired of each other's company. Even the strongest of us have faltered, with nothing to do but think on what is lost. I wake each day to forlorn faces and am reminded of where we are and all we have left behind. We are all yearning for a day when we can emerge from hiding and walk freely in the light once more, but I fear we are losing all hope that such a day will even come.\n\"Tenth Marking\" Tenth Kulniir\"\" I tire of the tears of women and children. My own have run dry. The men have begun to look upon us as if we are all weak, yet we have survived the same trials as they. I cannot bring myself to think on the numbers we lost in battle, yet I cannot force the images of my own losses from my mind and now, in a time when our people should be banding together in feels, we are drifting apart. The Nords have truly won. Our once great pride and unity are shattered. If we lose hope now we will never survive. Today many, myself included, have tried to speak out in voices of reason. There can be no hope without talk of our future. We can make no difference if our spirits remain broken.\n\"Eighteenth Marking\" Tenth Kulniir\"\" We know that we can never again be the Snow Elves and live freely. In that world we will forever be in hiding in one form or another, but there is no reason we cannot live life with the sun and the wind against our skin. There are those here who are friends to us and plan to help us once the threat has ended. We know now to survive, we must be born anew outside. We will appear. We belong here inside. We will carry our truth and our scars."}

Tonight is the first night of the rest of eternity.\nI rediscovered this diary today. It has been 13 years since I last wrote in it. With an eternity before, and the blood hunger ever pulsing in my veins, there is little urgency for diaries, or much of anything. Amiela is calling to me. I must go.\nHas it really been 89 years since I last wrote? The pages are getting fragile. I have rediscovered purpose, though it took nearly a century. I have finally gained some measure of control over the blood frenzy. I think I will try to establish a life among the living in one of their great cities.\nI had forgotten about this diary. I won't bother to calculate how many decades it has been since I last wrote in it. The cattle of this city know me as Jakben, Earl of Imbel. Centuries ago I knew myself as Springheel Jak, the famous thief. I seem to recall having a famous partner, but his name escapes me. No matter. I have grown beyond friends and partners. I rule the night here in the city."}

I have, once again, been misled. After entering the town, I came across a man who offered to help. Weak from hunger and exhaustion I believed him, and followed him underground to his home. They have a massive underground system of tunnels and old sewers here. It's really quite amazing. Unfortunately I seem to have made a rude comment about his sister being smoldering and he beat me senseless. When I awoke I was in this pit with no way out in sight. I can see up to the floor above, but no one responds to my cries for help. I fear I will end my days here. Oh, why did I ever leave my crew! They must be giving up hope now, as am I.\nDay Twenty-five:\nWoke up to hear noises of construction from the floor above. Ran to the opening and cried out. It was to no avail, however. Instead they tossed down the most horrible creature. It is rank and ugly and eyes me in the most vicious way. I have retreated to this corner and await my doom. It will get hungry soon, and I fear it sees me as its only source of food. I am too weak to defend myself. This will be my last entry.

He founded the Syffim, an organization of former Akaviri warriors. This would later become known as the &lt;a href=\"Fighters%20Guild\"&gt;Fighters Guild&lt;/a&gt;, after the introduction of the &lt;a href=\"Guilds%20Act\"&gt;Guilds Act&lt;/a&gt;.\nBackground.\nIn &lt;a href=\"2E%20320\"&gt;2E 320&lt;/a&gt;, Dinieras-Ves presented himself along with a host of companions to his &lt;a href=\"Tsaesci\"&gt;Tsaesci&lt;/a&gt; kinsman, &lt;a href=\"Versidue%20Shaie\"&gt;Versidue Shaie&lt;/a&gt;. Versidue-Shaie was at the time Potentate of &lt;a href=\"Cyrodiil\"&gt;Cyrodiil&lt;/a&gt; who was faced with a crumbling empire and constant revolts, which had led the treasury empty and the army all but disintegrated. Dinieras-Ves suggested to the Potentate that he would form a mercantile army, to be rented by the nobility, the Potentate would receive a fraction of the profits as well as be spared the necessity of a standing army. This was, however, a temporary solution.\nDinieras-Ves \"the Iron\" initially believed that the entirety of the order should be composed of Akaviri. This belief of his is not disputed by any historian, though his motivation is often debated. The traditional, simple explanation is that he knew his countrymen well, trusted them, and felt that their tradition of fighting for profit would be of use. Others believe, with reason, that he and the Potentate sought to use the order to effectively complete the conquest of Tamriel begun over five hundred years earlier. When Akavir attacked Tamriel in the\u00a02703rd\u00a0year of the\u00a01st era, they had been beaten back by the\u00a0Reman Dynasty. Now they had a Potentate on the throne, and with Dinieras-Ves's machinations, the local armies would also be Akaviri.\nAfter only a year in existence, the Syffim had been largely successful in dealing with the widespread chaos and brigands across the empire. As a result, Dinieras-Ves expanded the order and opened it up to new, local members to join. By 321, the Syffim had largely been effective in restoring order to the empire. Following the &lt;a href=\"Guilds%20Act\"&gt;Guilds Act&lt;/a&gt;, the Syffim was renamed to the &lt;a href=\"Fighters%20Guild\"&gt;Fighters Guild&lt;/a&gt;, as it had already popularly been known as. Following Versidue-Shaie's death by assassination by the &lt;a href=\"Morag%20Tong\"&gt;Morag Tong&lt;/a&gt; in the year 2E 324, his successor, &lt;a href=\"Savirien%20Chorak\"&gt;Savirien Chorak&lt;/a&gt; reformed the empire's army, thus the necessity of Dinieras-Ves' only 4-year-old guild was no longer prevalent to the empire.\nIt is unknown what specifically happened to Dinieras-Ves following the Guild Act, presumably heading the guild for the rest of his life. The Fighters Guild had already established themselves well within &lt;a href=\"Tamriel\"&gt;Tamriel&lt;/a&gt;, embodying the value of seeking your own fortune, it is due to this legendary reputation, of both the guild and himself, Dinieras-Ves is believed to be the ancestor in spirit of the modern phenomenon of the Adventurer, those men and women who dedicate their lives to questing for fame and fortune."}

Wishing to become more civilized, they made a bargain with &lt;a href=\"Y%27ffre\"&gt;Y'ffre&lt;/a&gt;, giving up shapeshifting in exchange for (what they think is) a more civilized demeanor.\nThis &lt;a href=\"Green%20Pact\"&gt;Green Pact&lt;/a&gt; affected every aspect of their lives. They became very ritualistic and, while these rituals may seem odd to \u2026 differently civilized \u2026 peoples, they do keep the Wood Elves from becoming fully savage again.One of their most important rituals is the &lt;a href=\"Handfasting\"&gt;Handfasting&lt;/a&gt;. It happens once a generation and is responsible for both anointing and marrying two of their three most important leaders (the third being the Camoran King or Queen of the Wood Elves).\nNo one but the Bosmer know how these two leaders are chosen, but they are, and the Handfast is the ritual that binds the Green Lady and the Silvenar together.\nThe Silvenar is the spiritual leader of the Bosmer, and a truly civilizing force on the entire race. Some say he is the embodiment of the Green Pact, others that he's simply a powerful mystic.\nWhen a Bosmer becomes the Silvenar, he or she gains a great understanding of the land they inhabit as well as its people.\nThe Green Lady, on the other hand, is a pure force of nature. She is the physicality of the Bosmer: a hunter, warrior, and nearly-unstoppable fist of her people.\nDo not confuse her passion for savagery, however! The Green Lady inherits the tactical poise of all those who've gone before her. The only thing that can turn her into a true beast is the death of her Silvenar \u2026 an occurrence some of us had the misfortune to witness on &lt;a href=\"Khenarthi%27s%20Roost\"&gt;Khenarthi Island&lt;/a&gt;. It is a wonder anyone survived.Take the Handfast as seriously as the Bosmer do and you should be fine. Eat what is offered (don't ask what it is), but drink sparingly\u2014their ritual drink \"&lt;a href=\"rotmeth\"&gt;rotmeth&lt;/a&gt;\" will sicken the most powerful non-Bosmer stomach if consumed with abandon.\nAvoid conflict when you can, but participating in a few non-lethal brawls during the celebration may not be avoidable. Indeed, it may be expected."}

Dragons aren't just coming back to life, they're being resurrected by other dragons. Delphine suspects that the Thalmor might be bringing dragons back for some sinister purpose. She's going to talk to her contacts about how we can infiltrate the Thalmor Embassy.\"\nWalkthrough.\nDelphine thinks that the Thalmor know something about, or are even responsible for, the dragons' return to &lt;a href=\"Skyrim\"&gt;Skyrim&lt;/a&gt;.

She will acquire a legitimate invitation to a reception being held by the Thalmor ambassador, &lt;a href=\"Elenwen%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Elenwen&lt;/a&gt;. Find the &lt;a href=\"Bosmer%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Bosmer&lt;/a&gt; servant who spies for the &lt;a href=\"Blades%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Blades&lt;/a&gt;, Malborn, at the Winking Skeever tavern in Solitude.\nWhen arriving, Malborn will agree to smuggle some equipment into the back-rooms. Malborn can bring an unlimited amount of gear with him, while the only gear the Dragonborn will have during the beginning of the mission will be what has been given to Malborn.\nThere is only one chance to give him gear. Nothing else can be given to him once the trade dialogue closes, and remember nothing else can be taken inside; give it to Malborn. Give him some &lt;a href=\"Lockpick%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;lockpicks&lt;/a&gt;, since there will be locks to pick.\nAfterwards, the Dragonborn will meet with Delphine at the &lt;a href=\"Katla%27s%20Farm\"&gt;Solitude Stables&lt;/a&gt; at Katla's Farm to pick up the invitation and party disguise, and then drop off everything else on hand with Delphine; everything given to her will be stored safely until reclaimed after the mission. Delphine will store the inventory in a chest in her hidden office in the &lt;a href=\"Sleeping%20Giant%20Inn\"&gt;Sleeping Giant Inn&lt;/a&gt; back in Riverwood.\nOnce at the party, the Dragonborn will be approached by ambassador Elenwen and will become engaged in conversation. Malborn interrupts the conversation, causing the ambassador to walk off. The Dragonborn then has the opportunity to speak with Malborn and ask him for a drink.\nDistracting the party guests.\nAmbassador Elenwen greets the Dragonborn upon entering the Thalmor Embassy. After speaking with her, the Dragonborn will need to create an opening to slip out of the party; tell Malborn when ready, and he will wait by the door behind the bar for the Dragonborn's next move:\nOnce there is an opening, go to the door behind the bar and follow Malborn. Go through the kitchen to a pantry, where Malborn will blackmail the Khajit cook to pretend she never saw them, retrieve the smuggled equipment from a chest, and go through a door into the next hallway. Malborn will lock the door behind the Dragonborn, completing this phase of the mission, while he heads back to the party before Elenwen grows suspicious of his disappearance.\nThalmor espionage.\nAs Malborn locks the door, two &lt;a href=\"Thalmor%20Soldier%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Thalmor Soldiers&lt;/a&gt; can be heard in the room past the door on the left:\nThalmor Soldier 1: \"Did you see those robes march in this morning? Who're they with? More of the Emissary's treaty enforcers?\"\nThalmor Soldier 2: \"No. They're high mages, just in from Alinor. I guess Herself is finally getting worried about all the dragon attacks.\"\nThalmor Soldier 1: \"Ah, good. I was wondering how we were supposed to defend this place from a dragon.\"\nThalmor Soldier 2: \"If a dragon does show up, maybe we'll get lucky and it will eat the mages first. Might give us enough time to kill it.\"\nThalmor Soldier 1: \"Ha! I'd like to see those arrogant bastards taken down a notch. Always looking down their noses at us lowly footsloggers.\"\nThalmor Soldier 1 and 2: \"[hearty laughter]\"\nThalmor Soldier 1: \"Well, I guess we should get back to our rounds.\"\nAfter talking, both will return to their duties in the room the Dragonborn will have to pass through to continue. Behind the bar are stairs leading up to a &lt;a href=\"Thalmor%20Wizard\"&gt;Thalmor Wizard&lt;/a&gt;. Kill them (or wait for them to move out of the way and sneak past them), and then either go through the ground floor exit or turn left at the top of the stairs. Kill or sneak around the mage, and then turn left again to enter a room with access to a second floor exit. This will open to an exterior area with more enemies to kill or avoid. The two guards can be avoided, but a mage guards the door and will alert the guards if he is attacked. It is, however, possible to go through the door with a sufficiently high &lt;a href=\"Sneak%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Sneak&lt;/a&gt; level without alerting the wizard, by sneaking as close to them as possible (within &lt;a href=\"Pickpocket\"&gt;Pickpocket&lt;/a&gt; range), targeting the door and activating it. If a general alarm is raised, additional guards will come from the barracks. Once clear, enter the only door into the ambassador's offices (Elenwen's Solar).\nIf the Dragonborn is an &lt;a href=\"Altmer%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Altmer&lt;/a&gt; and is wearing &lt;a href=\"hooded%20Thalmor%20Robes\"&gt;hooded Thalmor Robes&lt;/a&gt;, they may walk past all the guards without incident. Walking is essential, as running, even as an Altmer and wearing Thalmor robes, will cause the guards to become hostile. Even if the Dragonborn is an Altmer, the Thalmor wizard at the door to the Solar will ask why they are not at their post. At this point, the option to persuade the wizard that Elenwen wants to see them inside becomes available. If this persuasion is successful, the wizard will say to \"take his post\" and say not to let anyone in, at which point he should leave the area, but appears to stay where he is. Either way, once inside the Solar, any disguise will no longer work and everyone inside will become hostile on sight.\nInside, either kill everyone or sneak over to the chest the quest arrow is pointing to, and grab the needed items. Read the documents taken to activate the next arrow. If &lt;a href=\"Rulindil\"&gt;Rulindil&lt;/a&gt; and/or &lt;a href=\"Gissur\"&gt;Gissur&lt;/a&gt; are not killed, they will have to be fought later (when exiting the Embassy, and in a follow-up quest in &lt;a href=\"the%20Ratway\"&gt;the Ratway&lt;/a&gt;, respectively).\nThere is a locked display case in Rulindil's office, containing two &lt;a href=\"Elven%20Dagger%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;elven daggers&lt;/a&gt;, a gold and ruby circlet, and a gold and emerald circlet. There is also a &lt;a href=\"gold%20ingot\"&gt;gold ingot&lt;/a&gt; in one of the upper rooms, along with more loot, but one will have to slip by the lone Thalmor soldier that patrols the stairs or kill them to be able to loot the upper floor.\nAfter recovering the quest items from the office, the quest arrow will lead down into the dungeon, where &lt;a href=\"Etienne%20Rarnis\"&gt;Etienne Rarnis&lt;/a&gt; is being kept captive. If Rulindil was killed in his office, the only other person in the dungeon will be a guard patrolling outside the cells. If Rulindil was allowed to walk down the stairs, he will also be there, sitting at a desk (taking notes) while the guard tortures the prisoner to get him to confess the information the Thalmor are seeking regarding someone they are looking for of great interest.\nEtienne: \"Stop. Please. I don't know anything else. Don't you think I'd have told you already?\"\nSoldier: \"Silence. You know the rules. Do not speak unless spoken to. Master Rulindil will ask the questions.\"\nRulindil: \"Let's begin again.\"\nEtienne: \"No... for pity's sake... I've already told you everything...\"\nRulindil: \"You know the rules.\"\nEtienne: \"Noooooo!!!\"\nRulindil: \"Start at the beginning, as usual. If you persist in this stubbornness I'll have...\"\nEtienne: \"No, wait! I was just... catching my breath... why wouldn't I tell you again? I don't even know anything... There's an old man. He lives in Riften. He could be this Esbern you're looking for, but I don't know. He's old and seemed kind of crazy. That's all I know.\"\nRulindil: \"And his name is...?\"\nEtienne: \"I don't know his name. Like I've told already a hundred- Ahhhh!\"\nRulindil: \"You know the rules. Just answer the questions. And where can we find this nameless old man?\"\nEtienne: \"Like I said, I don't know! I've seen him down in the Ratway. Maybe he lives down there, but I don't know for sure.\"\nRulindil: \"That will be all for now. I must say I continue to be disappointed in your lack of cooperation. I hope next time you will do better.\"\nEtienne: \"What else do you want from me? I've already told you everything. Listen, if you let me go I can take you to Riften, show you where- Gaaaaah!!!\"\nSoldier: \"Silence, prisoner!\"\nInformation about &lt;a href=\"Esbern%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Esbern&lt;/a&gt; is needed to proceed. This can be done in three ways:\nWhichever method is used, learning about Esbern triggers a scripted event leading to the next stage of the quest.\nEscaping.\nAfter the Dragonborn learns about Esbern, two Thalmor guards will enter the dungeon with Malborn in custody, his cover blown. The guards hold the key to the trapdoor, so they have to be killed. If the Dragonborn is an Altmer dressed in full &lt;a href=\"Elven%20Armor%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Elven Armor&lt;/a&gt; the guards will not be hostile, allowing them to get within the range of melee weapons. If they are not dead yet, Rulindil and the guard that had been torturing Etienne will assist with attacking Malborn and the Dragonborn, so they will all have to be killed before escaping into the &lt;a href=\"Reeking%20Cave\"&gt;Reeking Cave&lt;/a&gt; through the trapdoor with the key looted from the guards' bodies. Note that at this time, if Brelas was imprisoned, would be the time to free her.\nOnce through the trapdoor, a &lt;a href=\"Frost%20Troll%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;frost troll&lt;/a&gt; will be waiting, as well as any followers that might have been left before entering the party. Under the stone ledge is a &lt;a href=\"Necromancer%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;necromancer's&lt;/a&gt; body, an &lt;a href=\"Illusion%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Illusion&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Skill%20Books%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Skill Book&lt;/a&gt; called \"&lt;a href=\"Before%20the%20Ages%20of%20Man\"&gt;Before the Ages of Man&lt;/a&gt;\", a &lt;a href=\"Stone%20of%20Barenziah\"&gt;Stone of Barenziah&lt;/a&gt;, and some loot. The Stone should be best seized now, for there is no other method of accessing this place upon quest completion.\nExiting the cave will allow seeing off anyone that was saved. Return to Riverwood to reclaim any gear from Delphine's chest. If Etienne survived, he can later be found in Riften among the &lt;a href=\"Thieves%20Guild%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Thieves Guild&lt;/a&gt;. If Malborn survived, he can be found in the &lt;a href=\"New%20Gnisis%20Cornerclub\"&gt;New Gnisis Cornerclub&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Windhelm%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Windhelm&lt;/a&gt;, and he will give the Dragonborn another quest to &lt;a href=\"Find%20the%20Thalmor%20Assassin\"&gt;find and kill a Thalmor assassin&lt;/a&gt; who is keeping him from leaving Windhelm and Skyrim. If the distraction done at the party led to Brelas being incarcerated and she is rescued with Malborn and Etienne, if she survived, she will flee with Malborn to Windhelm, and then flee with him back across the Skyrim-Morrowind border once Malborn's quest is completed.\nPotential guests.\nThe following is a list of all the potential guests who may be found during the party.\nConversations.\nDuring the quest, the present Jarls can have a variety of conversations:\nJarl 1: \"We've got our hands full dealing with the Stormcloaks. What about you?\"\nJarl 2: \"We've had the same troubles.\"\nJarl 1: \"With any luck, a worthy hero will step forward and solve our problems, just like in the tales of old.\"\nJarl 1: \"Are the dragons frightening your people as much as they're frightening mine?\"\nJarl 2: \"I've spent many hours in council meetings lately grappling with that problem.\"\nJarl 1: \"We must keep faith in ourselves and the Divines.\"\nJarl 1: \"Have you found it difficult to get provisions lately? I can scarcely feed the staff in my palace.\"\nJarl 2: \"I've spent many hours in council meetings lately grappling with that problem.\"\nJarl 1: \"These are troubling times, indeed.\"\nJarl 1: \"Between the dragons and the Stormcloaks, my coffers are running dry.\"\nJarl 2: \"I've spent many hours in council meetings lately grappling with that problem.\"\nJarl 1: \"These are troubling times, indeed.\"\nThere's also a variety of generic topics which can be overheard.\nFirst line:\n\"I heard Elenwen say she's going open a bottle of her best Firebrand Wine later. I can hardly wait.\"\n\"These Stormcloaks are nothing more than an armed mob. This war won't last much longer.\"\n\"I hope they'll serve the roast venison with bittergreen sauce that we had at the last party. That was delicious.\"\n\"This war has taken a toll on the merchants of Skyrim. Let's hope that it ends soon, for their sake.\"\n\"I look forward to the day when this rebellion is put down, and we once again have peace.\"\n\"The Gray Quarter in Windhelm is little better than a slum. It's shameful that the dark elves are made to live that way.\"\n\"With the soldiers all fighting in the war, there's nobody to hunt down the bandits. Travel has become dangerous of late.\"\n\"It's been a brutal winter. I can't remember the last time it was this cold, and for this long.\"\nResponding line:\n\"Yes, I agree with you. Have you heard any news from the other parts of Skyrim?\"\n\"You speak truly. Have you heard any interesting rumors of late?\"\n\"I'll not argue that. Heard any interesting gossip lately?\"\n\"I couldn't agree more. By the way, have you heard any interesting rumors lately?\"\n\"I couldn't have said it better myself. It's been some time since I've had news from elsewhere in Skyrim. What have you heard?\"\n\"I know just what you mean. Heard anything interesting lately? Any news or gossip?\"\nClosing line:\n\"Well, I did hear that the Argonians have been banned from living inside the walls of Windhelm. They're only allowed on the city docks now. Most of them sleep together in one building, and they're as poor as wretches.\"\n\"Have you visited Rorikstead lately? No matter how harsh the winter, the crops that grow there never falter. Even when every other farm in the hold is barely scraping by, the harvest at Rorikstead is always bountiful. Is it good fortune? The blessings of the Divines? Who knows?\"\n\"Now that I think on it, I did hear something rather interesting the other day. Apparently, the Red Wave has been docked in Solitude for well over a month, and with no sign of shipping out any time soon. Some say the ship suffered damage to her hull when she struck an iceberg, and Captain Safia can't afford the repairs. Of course, she would never admit such a thing. Captain Safia is far too proud a woman for that.\"\n\"Well, there might be nothing to it, but I've heard that the feud between the Gray-Manes and the Battle-Borns in Whiterun has grown ugly. Fralia Gray-Mane is convinced that the Battle-Borns have abducted one of her sons.\"\n\"I'm not sure that it's news, but lately it seems like every blacksmith in Skyrim is out to prove that he's the equal of Eorlund Gray-Mane. It's not really a fair comparison, if you ask me. After all, Eorlund works the Skyforge. How is any smith going to compete with that?\"\n\"Well, I did see something interesting not long ago. There were several Khajiit camped outside the walls of Whiterun. Seems they've been traveling around the whole of Skyrim peddling their wares. You've got to admire their courage, doing something like that with dragons on the loose and a war going on.\"\n\"I heard those mages up in Winterhold have been trying to figure out how many dragons there are in Skyrim. They seem to think it's at least a dozen, but I'm sure they're exaggerating. They're probably trying to scare us into giving them more money and influence, so they can save us from the dragons threat.\"\n\"Well, I did hear that Ulfric Stormcloak was slain while defending Windhelm against a dragon, but it sounds too good to be true. I'll wager it was Ulfric himself that started the rumor. Maybe he thought it would bolster recruitment.\""}

{"id": "809576", "revid": "7075644", "url": "https://elderscrolls.fandom.com/wiki?curid=809576", "title": "Dire Legends of the Doomcrag", "text": "Dire Legends of the Doomcrag is a &lt;a href=\"Books%20%28Online%29\"&gt;book&lt;/a&gt; in .\nContents.\nIn the distant past, the dark and foreboding pinnacle of stone known as the &lt;a href=\"The%20Doomcrag\"&gt;Doomcrag&lt;/a&gt; was a place of learning and worship for the &lt;a href=\"Ayleid\"&gt;Ayleid&lt;/a&gt; people. But in recent memory, the place has been known as a haunted peak beyond a treacherous pass of fog and shadow.\nDue to the current interest in the often ignored location, &lt;a href=\"Countess%20Tamrith\"&gt;Countess Tamrith&lt;/a&gt; has asked me to chronicle a few of the legends concerning this forbidden place.\nOne dark tale concerns the hero of &lt;a href=\"House%20Dorell\"&gt;House Dorell&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Brianna%20the%20Bold\"&gt;Brianna the Bold&lt;/a&gt;, who traveled to the &lt;a href=\"Shrouded%20Pass\"&gt;Shrouded Pass&lt;/a&gt; to chase down the bandit lord, &lt;a href=\"Red%20Rob\"&gt;Red Rob&lt;/a&gt;. Brianna and her troop of knights chased Red Rob all along the northern shore, intent on capturing him and bringing him to justice for his many crimes\u2014including his most recent exploit, the pillaging of a Dorell cargo ship. Unfortunately for Red Rob, the House Baron of the period's daughter was traveling on the ship when Red Rob and his cohorts attacked it. For injuries and insults, she demanded the head of the brigand and dispatched Brianna the Bold to hunt him down.\nBy the time Brianna reached the entrance to the Shrouded Pass, all of her knights had been killed or wounded. She was on her own. Luckily for her, Red Rob had not fared any better. He was alone when he plunged into the dense fog to avoid her. Not to be deterred, Brianna was true to her name and boldly charged in after him. It was the last time either Brianna or Red Rob were ever seen again.\nBut locals claim that on clear, cold nights, when a thin, red mist decorates the jutting shard of rock, you can hear the clash of steel on steel as Brianna and Red Rob continue their epic struggle into eternity.\nAnother popular, if somewhat disturbing, legend concerning the Doomcrag tells the tale of the spurned Ayleid lover who pines away at the very apex of the mountain. Rejected by a handsome butler in the service of a noble house, the spurned lover climbed to the top of the Doomcrag and refused to come down. Her friends and family tried everything to cheer her up and make her leave the tower. Distraught and sick at heart, she ignored every plea and word of comfort. And when her pain became unbearable, she leaped from the Doomcrag and crashed into the sea far below.\nThat, however, was not the end of her sad story, People believe that to this very day, handsome travelers who wander too close to the Doomcrag risk attracting the attention of the spurned Ayleid. They say that her restless spirit swoops down and\u2014pardon the wordplay\u2014spirits away the hapless traveler, carrying him to the top of the mountain to keep him as a pet and plaything. Ultimately, however, even the most-patient captive does something to reject and spurn the Ayleid spirit. On lonely nights, or so the story goes, you can hear the intermingled screams as the Ayleid spirit once again hurls herself into the sea, carrying her latest lover with her to a watery grave.\nBut perhaps the most common tale told about the Doomcrag describes the Death That Walks. This particular legend is more a cautionary tale than a scary story with a beginning, a middle, and an end. It says that any who attempt to climb the Shrouded Pass inevitably climb to their deaths. With every step, a year of life is lost. Depending on your age and relative level of health, death might overtake you after only a few steps up into the dense fog. Or, if you're particularly lucky, you might ascend all the way to the very top\u2014into the rumored relic chamber\u2014before the Death That Walks catches up with you.\nWhichever the case, every step brings with it a measure of pain and weakness as you march to your inevitable demise. This legend, more than any other, has kept the Doomcrag shrouded in mystery, for few have been brave enough to test the veracity of this story.\nReveiwing my notes, I can see why Countess Tamrith was frightened of the Doomcrag when she was a young girl. If truth be told, even at my advanced age, these legends frighten me."}

From this point onwards, those carrying the gift (or curse, depending on whom one is talking to), will be able to change into a Werewolf once a day, which causes people nearby to retreat and yield or attack. The Dragonborn will also receive a bounty if the transformation is witnessed by a citizen.\nMembers of any &lt;a href=\"Factions%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;faction&lt;/a&gt; will not attack the Dragonborn in either humanoid or Werewolf form after joining, nor will a &lt;a href=\"Hero%20of%20Sovngarde\"&gt;Hero of Sovngarde&lt;/a&gt; assault them.\nAbilities.\nAdvantages.\nSkills, perks, spells and abilities as apply (or do not apply) to the Werewolf:\nBecoming a Werewolf.\nIn , the only way to become a Werewolf is to complete the quest line for the Companions of &lt;a href=\"Jorrvaskr\"&gt;Jorrvaskr&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Whiterun%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Whiterun&lt;/a&gt;, up until the quest \"The Silver Hand.\" Within the Companions exists &lt;a href=\"the%20Circle\"&gt;the Circle&lt;/a&gt;, an inner sub-faction.

There he will offer the opportunity to drink the blood of Aela the Huntress when she is in Werewolf form, and become a Werewolf.\nBeast Form lasts approximately two and a half minutes, with only one use per day. Unlike in \"Morrowind\", one does not change into a Werewolf at a fixed time, as it is a power. To be able to stay in Werewolf mode for a prolonged period of time, one must \"Feed\" off fallen human characters, which adds 30 seconds to the current time per feeding, and also heal the Dragonborn. With \"Dawnguard\" installed, the Dragonborn can choose a perk that allows them to feed on almost any fallen opponent, although it only prolongs the duration for half of what feeding off of humanoid opponents gives. Once returned to normal form, all items will have been unequipped and the Dragonborn will have to wait twenty-four hours to be able to use Beast Form again.\nIf the Dragonborn has obtained the &lt;a href=\"Hircine%27s%20Ring%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Ring of Hircine&lt;/a&gt;, equipping it will allow the use of a separate power, \"Ring of Hircine,\" which is identical to Beast Form and offers all the same benefits. The only difference is that it is not limited to once-a-day use, it is made available any time the Dragonborn equips the ring. Followers will not react to the Dragonborn's transformation. Due to the restrictions placed on Werewolves interacting with objects and characters, one will not be able to interact with a follower while transformed (on Xbox 360, one can bypass this by using Kinect commands). A follower will become hostile if hit while the character is in Beast Form, even if they are a companion.\n&lt;a href=\"Eorlund%20Gray-Mane\"&gt;Eorlund Gray-Mane&lt;/a&gt; will defend the Dragonborn if they transform publicly in Whiterun.\nWild wolves become non-hostile when one is in Beast Form, but wild Werewolves, added on by \"Dawnguard\", will still attack.\nThe Dragonborn can be killed while transforming, if facing a powerful enough foe. \nSkill tree.\nWerewolf.\nThe Werewolf skill tree includes eight perks.

He was responsible to teach the &lt;a href=\"Argonian\"&gt;Argonian&lt;/a&gt;\u00a0how they worked in the sump, taking care of growing Umbrielians.

Wert was severely wounded, and Glim had to pull him out of the water to save his life.\nWert explained to Glim that taking the vapors severely damaged their health. When Glim stood up to their overseer, the skraws were convinced that he could change their lifestyle. Glim organised a secret rebellion with the skraws in order to sabotage Umbriel, convincing them that the lords would then hear their petitions. The skraws made maps of the pipelines that connected the different parts of Umbriel. Wert was caught red handed sabotaging &lt;a href=\"Toel\"&gt;Toel&lt;/a&gt;'s kitchen. Fortunately, Mere-Glim was around to killing Toel and his assistants.\nWhen the lords discovered the skraws were the responsibles for Umbriel's malfunctioning, they sent guards to kill Mere-Glim.

It is a massive grazeland created in a battle between &lt;a href=\"Vivec\"&gt;Vivec&lt;/a&gt;, the Warrior-Poet and the &lt;a href=\"Ruddy%20Man\"&gt;Ruddy Man&lt;/a&gt;. The region gets their name from the fact that it cuts or gashes deep into the area in between the &lt;a href=\"Bitter%20Coast\"&gt;Bitter Coast&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Molag%20Amur\"&gt;Molag Amur&lt;/a&gt;.\nDescription.\nGeography.\nWest Gash makes up a large portion of the western side of Vvardenfell, reaching from as far as the northern coast to the &lt;a href=\"Odai%20River\"&gt;Odai River&lt;/a&gt; basin. As mentioned before, the West Gash was the result of the battle between Vivec and the Ruddy Man, which caused the land to gash into southwestern Vvardenfell, creating the modern-day West Gash. The region is very fertile, north towards the &lt;a href=\"Samsi%20River\"&gt;Samsi River&lt;/a&gt; are large fungal trees with open areas of fresh grazelands, several creatures such as the &lt;a href=\"Nix-Ox\"&gt;Nix-Ox&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Bull%20Netch\"&gt;Bull Netch&lt;/a&gt; thrive in the area. The southern area has the potential of being volcanic since it is not far from the volcanic &lt;a href=\"Molag%20Amur\"&gt;Molag Amur&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Foyada%20Mamaea\"&gt;Foyada Mamaea&lt;/a&gt;. The northern area has the same issue, being very close to the local &lt;a href=\"Ashlands\"&gt;Ashlands&lt;/a&gt; and as a result, closer to &lt;a href=\"Red%20Mountain\"&gt;Red Mountain&lt;/a&gt;. Regardless, there are more settlements in the north than in the south. What makes the region valuable to investors from the Empire is the large deposits of &lt;a href=\"Ebony%20Ore\"&gt;Ebony Ore&lt;/a&gt; in the southern reaches and the abundance of northern fish, as well as the trading town of &lt;a href=\"Gnisis\"&gt;Gnisis&lt;/a&gt;. Travelers coming from places such as &lt;a href=\"Blacklight\"&gt;Blacklight&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"Windhelm\"&gt;Windhelm&lt;/a&gt; are prone to enter the West Gash due to its proximity. The West Gash is primarily &lt;a href=\"House%20Redoran\"&gt;House Redoran&lt;/a&gt; territory.\nHistory.\n&lt;a href=\"Second%20Era\"&gt;Second Era&lt;/a&gt;.\nDuring the &lt;a href=\"Interregnum\"&gt;Interregnum&lt;/a&gt;, the western portion of Vvardenfell was under the occupation of the Great &lt;a href=\"House%20Redoran\"&gt;House Redoran&lt;/a&gt;, from as far as the Sheogoard Strait to the Balmora Pass on the northern end of the &lt;a href=\"Odai%20River\"&gt;Odai River&lt;/a&gt;. Redoran virtually controlled the West Gash, as well as the frontier known as the &lt;a href=\"Bitter%20Coast\"&gt;Bitter Coast&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href=\"House%20Hlaalu\"&gt;House Hlaalu&lt;/a&gt; had operations throughout this area, most notably from the port town of &lt;a href=\"Seyda%20Neen\"&gt;Seyda Neen&lt;/a&gt;, in cooperation with the &lt;a href=\"Gold%20Coast%20Trading%20Company%20%28Faction%29\"&gt;Gold Coast Trading Company&lt;/a&gt; from the &lt;a href=\"Colovian%20West\"&gt;Colovian West&lt;/a&gt;. The two most notable Redoran strongholds are the towns of &lt;a href=\"Balmora\"&gt;Balmora&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Gnisis\"&gt;Gnisis&lt;/a&gt;. What was interesting about Balmora was that the city was built in the Hlaalu style with Imperial-esque architecture, without the roof and made out of clay, rather than bug shells like with the Redoran-folk or large mushroom towers like the &lt;a href=\"Telvanni\"&gt;Telvanni&lt;/a&gt;. Balmora became the center of economy in western Vvardenfell, due to its convenient location, in a pass between Seyda Neen and &lt;a href=\"Ald%27ruhn\"&gt;Ald'ruhn&lt;/a&gt;. The Redoran in Balmora had vast control over the west and would have constant conflicts with the local &lt;a href=\"Ashlander\"&gt;Ashlander&lt;/a&gt;s, at this point, the &lt;a href=\"Ahemmusa%20Tribe\"&gt;Ahemmusa Tribe&lt;/a&gt; lived in southern Bitter Coast, before moving to the &lt;a href=\"Grazelands\"&gt;Grazelands&lt;/a&gt;. Because the elves of Redoran and Hlaalu were a part of the &lt;a href=\"Ebonheart%20Pact\"&gt;Ebonheart Pact&lt;/a&gt;, the alliance would have substantial control over Balmora, Gnisis, Seyda Neen, and other cities.\nThe city of Balmora was ruled by &lt;a href=\"Councilor%20Eris\"&gt;Councilor Eris Releth&lt;/a&gt;, a high-ranking member of the Great House Redoran. Eris had two children, both named &lt;a href=\"Veya%20Releth\"&gt;Veya Releth&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Ulvan%20Releth\"&gt;Ulvan Releth&lt;/a&gt;. Eris was devoted to the well-being of House Redoran, to the point where he had grown astray from his children, this would prove to be his downfall. Ulvan was a high-ranking member of the Redoran Guard and was well-respected for his forgiving and kindly personality. Ulvan was known to be friendly with the local Ashlanders, much to the dismay of the Redoran Council. Eris wanted to test Ulvan's loyalty to House Redoran by employing &lt;a href=\"Captain%20Brivan\"&gt;Captain Brivan&lt;/a&gt; to have one of his guards kill an Ashlander merchant and to see if Ulvan would intervene. When Ulvan saw this abuse, he would hastily kill the Redoran Guard in front of the other guardsmen. Ulvan was exiled from Vvardenfell by order of his father but would instead travel to the Ashlander camp located in the entrance to &lt;a href=\"Kudanat\"&gt;Kudanat&lt;/a&gt;. When news of this had reached Brivan, he hired the &lt;a href=\"Khajiit\"&gt;Khajiit&lt;/a&gt; mercenary group known as &lt;a href=\"Ferhara%27s%20Warclaws%20%28Faction%29\"&gt;Ferhara's Warclaws&lt;/a&gt; to raid the camp and to kill everyone in it, including Ulvan.\nWhen Ulvan disappeared for several months with no signs. Veya became concerned and ran away from home to find her brother. This caused Eris and the other councilman to worry and to hire anyone who could find Veya. Veya would join the &lt;a href=\"Morag%20Tong\"&gt;Morag Tong&lt;/a&gt; under the teachings of &lt;a href=\"Naryu%20Virian\"&gt;Naryu Virian&lt;/a&gt;, a veteran assassin who was present in &lt;a href=\"Deshaan%20Plain\"&gt;Deshaan&lt;/a&gt; to fight against the &lt;a href=\"Llodos%20Plague\"&gt;Llodos Plague&lt;/a&gt;. Veya, Naryu, and a &lt;a href=\"Vestige\"&gt;third traveler&lt;/a&gt; were able to uncover the massacre at Kudanat and Eris' plot against Ulvan. With this information, Veya traveled to the &lt;a href=\"Redoran%20Garrison\"&gt;Redoran Garrison&lt;/a&gt; located north of Balmora to confront her father about it. In her fit of rage, she murdered her father and was unfortunately defeated by the third warrior. Her fate was left to Virian and the warrior, some say she had died in there as well, while others have said she retreated to the &lt;a href=\"Summerset%20Isles\"&gt;Summerset Isles&lt;/a&gt; since Morag Tong agents are meant to kill someone under a contract.\n&lt;a href=\"Third%20Era\"&gt;Third Era&lt;/a&gt;.\nBy &lt;a href=\"3E%20427\"&gt;3E 427&lt;/a&gt;, the southern portion of the West Gash was eventually taken by the merchant lords of House Hlaalu, much to the dismay to the nobles of House Redoran. The city of Balmora was occupied by the Hlaalu under the administration of &lt;a href=\"Nileno%20Dorvayn\"&gt;Nileno Dorvayn&lt;/a&gt; and eventually, &lt;a href=\"Imperials\"&gt;Imperials&lt;/a&gt; of the &lt;a href=\"Septim%20Empire\"&gt;Septim Empire&lt;/a&gt; migrated into the West Gash. This new expansion was the result of the repeal of the &lt;a href=\"Treaty%20of%20the%20Armistice\"&gt;Treaty of the Armistice&lt;/a&gt; which allowed foreigners to inhabit the Island of &lt;a href=\"Vvardenfell\"&gt;Vvardenfell&lt;/a&gt;. The &lt;a href=\"Imperial%20Legion\"&gt;Imperial Legion&lt;/a&gt; established the &lt;a href=\"Moonmoth%20Legion%20Fort\"&gt;Moonmoth Legion Fort&lt;/a&gt; outside of the city of Balmora and investors created the township of &lt;a href=\"Caldera\"&gt;Caldera&lt;/a&gt;, located on the road in between Balmora and Ald'ruhn. With the abundance of ebony inside the Caldera Crater, the &lt;a href=\"Caldera%20Mining%20Company\"&gt;Caldera Mining Company&lt;/a&gt; established an outpost with the area."}

While the Old Holds are more conservative and keep to the old ways, Western Skyrim is more progressive and has close ties to the Empire of &lt;a href=\"Cyrodiil\"&gt;Cyrodiil&lt;/a&gt;.\nDescription.\nGeography.\nWest Skyrim consists of the western holds of Skyrim, which include &lt;a href=\"Falkreath%20Hold\"&gt;Falkreath&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Haafingar\"&gt;Haafingar&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Hjaalmarch\"&gt;Hjaalmarch&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"The%20Reach\"&gt;The Reach&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Whiterun%20Hold\"&gt;Whiterun&lt;/a&gt;. The capital of the nation is the city of &lt;a href=\"Solitude\"&gt;Solitude&lt;/a&gt;, located on a natural arch in the mountains of Haafingar. West Skyrim takes up a larger portion than the Old Holds since it consists of five different holds, as opposed to the four in the east. Large landmarks in the area include the &lt;a href=\"Karth%20River\"&gt;Karth River&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Lake%20Ilinalta\"&gt;Lake Ilinalta&lt;/a&gt;, and the &lt;a href=\"Labyrinthian\"&gt;Labyrinthian&lt;/a&gt;.\nHistory.\n&lt;a href=\"Second%20Era\"&gt;Second Era&lt;/a&gt;.\nDuring the &lt;a href=\"Interregnum\"&gt;Interregnum&lt;/a&gt;, the province of Skyrim was ruled by &lt;a href=\"High%20King%20Logrolf\"&gt;High King Logrolf&lt;/a&gt; and was a close ally to the &lt;a href=\"Second%20Empire\"&gt;Second Empire&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"Reman%20Cyrodiil%20III\"&gt;Reman Cyrodiil III&lt;/a&gt;. When Reman was assassinated by the &lt;a href=\"Morag%20Tong\"&gt;Morag Tong&lt;/a&gt; in his chambers, many leaders of the Empire were killed as well; this included Logrolf. Logrolf's daughter, &lt;a href=\"Freydis\"&gt;Freydis&lt;/a&gt;, was to assume the throne after him. The &lt;a href=\"Crown%20of%20Verity\"&gt;Crown of Verity&lt;/a&gt; chose her to lead her people in the coming years. A &lt;a href=\"Moot\"&gt;Moot&lt;/a&gt; was made in the city of Solitude, and the Jarls of Skyrim chose &lt;a href=\"Svartr\"&gt;Jarl Svartr&lt;/a&gt; of Solitude to become the next &lt;a href=\"High%20King\"&gt;High King&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"2E%20431\"&gt;2E 431&lt;/a&gt;. Svartr had also claimed that Freydis was an illegitimate daughter to Logrolf, and that she did not deserve the throne. This conflict resulted in the province of Skyrim to split into two separate kingdoms, one with Freydis being High Queen, and one with Svartr being High King. Svartr's Skyrim would become known as the Kingdom of Western Skyrim.\nIn &lt;a href=\"1E%20980\"&gt;1E 980&lt;/a&gt;, the city of &lt;a href=\"Orsinium\"&gt;Orsinium&lt;/a&gt; was besieged by the combined forces of &lt;a href=\"Daggerfall\"&gt;Daggerfall&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Sentinel\"&gt;Sentinel&lt;/a&gt;. As a result, the many &lt;a href=\"Orc\"&gt;Orc&lt;/a&gt;ish tribes living in &lt;a href=\"Wrothgar\"&gt;Wrothgar&lt;/a&gt; were scattered throughout the Reach and beyond. They settled in places such as &lt;a href=\"Upper%20Craglorn\"&gt;Upper Craglorn&lt;/a&gt; and Western Falkreath, which brought trouble onto the city of &lt;a href=\"Falkreath\"&gt;Falkreath&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href=\"Yashnag%20gro-Yazgu\"&gt;Yashnag gro-Yazgu&lt;/a&gt; established an Orcish Kingdom in Western Falkreath to reclaim the territory lost from the &lt;a href=\"Nords\"&gt;Nords&lt;/a&gt; of ye old. Yashnag killed the Jarl of Falkreath in his conquest, leaving the Jarl's son, &lt;a href=\"Hakkvild%20Yashnag-Slayer\"&gt;Hakkvild&lt;/a&gt;, to take revenge and assume the throne of Falkreath. The Orcish Berserkers gave West Skyrim and Svartr trouble by defeating squadrons sent from the capital. Hakkvild challenged Yashnag to a duel, resulting in Yashnag's defeat and the end of the Kingdom. Yashnag's endeavors would inspire &lt;a href=\"Kurog%20gro-Bagrakh\"&gt;Kurog gro-Bagrakh&lt;/a&gt; to build the second iteration of &lt;a href=\"Orsinium\"&gt;Orsinium&lt;/a&gt;.\nDuring the &lt;a href=\"Alliance%20War\"&gt;Alliance War&lt;/a&gt;, the Kingdom of Western Skyrim was ruled by &lt;a href=\"High%20King%20Svargrim\"&gt;High King Svargrim&lt;/a&gt;, a descendant of Svartr. He had ruled the region since &lt;a href=\"2E%20561\"&gt;2E 561&lt;/a&gt;. Svargrim was of old age by the time the Alliance War came to fruition. Despite this, he had no intent of leaving the throne until his death in &lt;a href=\"2E%20582\"&gt;2E 582&lt;/a&gt;. West Skyrim was not involved in the Alliance War, unlike the Nords of East Skyrim, who make up a third of the &lt;a href=\"Ebonheart%20Pact\"&gt;Ebonheart Pact&lt;/a&gt;. Markarth became independent from West Skyrim and was ruled by &lt;a href=\"Reachmen\"&gt;Reachmen&lt;/a&gt;. The &lt;a href=\"Despot%20of%20Markarth\"&gt;Despot of Markarth&lt;/a&gt; was known to conspire with the &lt;a href=\"Order%20of%20the%20Black%20Worm\"&gt;Order of the Black Worm&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Mannimarco\"&gt;Mannimarco&lt;/a&gt;, the King of Worms.\n&lt;a href=\"Fourth%20Era\"&gt;Fourth Era&lt;/a&gt;.\nWest Skyrim dissolved sometime before the &lt;a href=\"Third%20Era\"&gt;Third Era&lt;/a&gt;, when &lt;a href=\"Tiber%20Septim\"&gt;Tiber Septim&lt;/a&gt; first became the new &lt;a href=\"Emperor\"&gt;Emperor&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"Tamriel\"&gt;Tamriel&lt;/a&gt;. Despite the Kingdom dissolving, remnants of this ideology still existed in Skyrim. The denizens of Western Skyrim were firm believers of the &lt;a href=\"Third%20Empire\"&gt;Third Empire&lt;/a&gt;, and felt that Skyrim was in better hands with the Empire. Skyrim would not be split this way again at the beginning of &lt;a href=\"4E%20201\"&gt;4E 201&lt;/a&gt;. The Jarl of &lt;a href=\"Windhelm\"&gt;Windhelm&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Ulfric%20Stormcloak%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Ulfric Stormcloak&lt;/a&gt; defeated &lt;a href=\"High%20King%20Torygg\"&gt;High King Torygg&lt;/a&gt; in a duel that ultimately killed him in the process. Ulfric utilized the &lt;a href=\"Thu%27um\"&gt;Thu'um&lt;/a&gt; to subsequently kill Torygg, which branded Ulfric a murderer throughout the cities in Skyrim. Solitude, &lt;a href=\"Markarth%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Markarth&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Morthal\"&gt;Morthal&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Falkreath\"&gt;Falkreath&lt;/a&gt; banded together to fight against the Old Holds and Ulfric's army, the &lt;a href=\"Stormcloaks\"&gt;Stormcloaks&lt;/a&gt;. The city of &lt;a href=\"Whiterun\"&gt;Whiterun&lt;/a&gt; was in a gray area of the war, but it still saw support in the Empire. West Skyrim and East Skyrim would fight against each other in an event called the &lt;a href=\"Skyrim%20Civil%20War\"&gt;Skyrim Civil War&lt;/a&gt;."}

The zone was added with &lt;a href=\"Update%2042\"&gt;Update 42&lt;/a&gt; along with the release of the \"Gold Road\" chapter and is part of the &lt;a href=\"Recollection%20of%20Ithelia\"&gt;Recollection of Ithelia&lt;/a&gt; storyline, the second and final part of the &lt;a href=\"Secrets%20of%20Apocrypha\"&gt;Secrets of Apocrypha&lt;/a&gt; story arc.\nLocations.\nThe following are locations accessible in the West Weald and, with the exception of &lt;a href=\"Unmarked%20Locations%20%28Online%29\"&gt;unmarked locations&lt;/a&gt;, are discoverable on the map. Points of Interest serve as locations with unique side quests, while &lt;a href=\"Cities%20%28Online%29\"&gt;cities&lt;/a&gt; serve as the centralized areas with multiple sublocations and act as a hub for services and &lt;a href=\"Merchants%20%28Online%29\"&gt;merchants&lt;/a&gt;. Explanations of the types of locations are provided in the &lt;a href=\"Locations%20%28Online%29%23Types\"&gt;main locations page&lt;/a&gt;.\nQuests.\nThe West Weald features a series of zone story quests and unrelated side quests. The zone story quests tie into the Shadow Over Morrowind overarching storyline, but it is not necessary to complete the story quests for the &lt;a href=\"Telvanni%20Peninsula%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Telvanni Peninsula&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Apocrypha%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Apocrypha&lt;/a&gt;. Side quests are non-sequential and can be completed in any order, except where one carries on from another, and &lt;a href=\"repeatable%20quests\"&gt;repeatable quests&lt;/a&gt; can be completed multiple times: weekly for arenas and trials and daily for all others.\nItem sets.\nItem sets are related armor and weapons that, when worn together, provide unique benefits. Overland sets can be acquired from world bosses, world events, delves, public dungeons and containers and as quest rewards; dungeon sets can be acquired from within group dungeons; monster sets can be acquired from the final boss of veteran group dungeons and Undaunted Enclaves; and crafted sets can be created at specific locations across the zone.\nSkyshards.\nEighteen Skyshards can be found in the West Weald totaling in six &lt;a href=\"skill%20points\"&gt;skill points&lt;/a&gt;. The zone guide provides clues as to the location of each Skyshard, but many can be found simply by exploring and watching for the distinctive pillar of light they emit. Skyshards will appear on the map and compass when the Vestige is close to one and will remain discovered on the map even if it was not collected.\nAchievements.\nAchievements can be earned by completing specific tasks such as completing quests and discovering locations. Achievements are separated into categories and their progress is viewable from the journal. Earning achievement provides the Vestige a number of points, and some achievements unlock unique rewards such as &lt;a href=\"Furnishings%20%28Online%29\"&gt;furnishings&lt;/a&gt; that can be bought from Achievement Furnishers or &lt;a href=\"collectibles\"&gt;collectibles&lt;/a&gt;.\nShalidor's Library.\nNine books that are a part of Shalidor's Library can be found in the West Weald and added to the collection. Books that have already been found in other zones will already be marked as completed in the zone tracker.\nFish.\nFish can be caught from fishing hotspots, ideally with the correct &lt;a href=\"bait\"&gt;bait&lt;/a&gt;. Common fish will be caught most often while rare fish and alternative bait are rare catches. Each zone has unique rare fish than can be caught from hotspots. &lt;a href=\"Slaughterfish%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Slaughterfish&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"trodh\"&gt;trodh&lt;/a&gt; can be caught from foul hotspots, &lt;a href=\"dhufish\"&gt;dhufish&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"longfin\"&gt;longfin&lt;/a&gt; can be caught from saltwater hotspots, &lt;a href=\"silverside%20perch\"&gt;silverside perch&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"spadetail\"&gt;spadetail&lt;/a&gt; can be caught from lake hotspots, and &lt;a href=\"Salmon%20%28Online%29\"&gt;salmon&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"River%20Betty%20%28Online%29\"&gt;river betty&lt;/a&gt; can be caught from river hotspots. &lt;a href=\"Chub\"&gt;Chub&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"minnow\"&gt;minnow&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"shad\"&gt;shad&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"fish%20roe\"&gt;fish roe&lt;/a&gt; can be caught and used as bait from foul, saltwater, lake and river hotspots, respectively."}

Their commander is &lt;a href=\"General%20Lavinia\"&gt;General Lavinia&lt;/a&gt;.\nAbout the Legion.\nThe West Weald Legion was tasked by the &lt;a href=\"Elder%20Council\"&gt;Elder Council&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Count\"&gt;Count&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"Skingrad\"&gt;Skingrad&lt;/a&gt; to conqeur the territory known as the &lt;a href=\"Arenthia%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Arenthian Vale&lt;/a&gt;, which is located south of the &lt;a href=\"Strid%20River\"&gt;River Strid&lt;/a&gt;. However, not all of the soldiers saw the conquest as worthy, or possible, under the General's leadership. They thought that the Legion would be unable to hold the territory they had won, so they deserted and were planning to pillage the land when things would quiet down. One of their armies got sent to &lt;a href=\"Fort%20Grimwatch\"&gt;Fort Grimwatch&lt;/a&gt;, however, this army is not seen.\n&lt;a href=\"The%20Colovian%20Occupation\"&gt;In Arenthia&lt;/a&gt;.\nWith the use of magic, General Lavinia spread the message around Arenthia that they weren't there to harm them. Some of the town's population had no issue with the Legion taking over the town, as they just wanted peace, regardless of who ruled over the city, though some found the use of projections strange. After the fall of the city, the Legion started taking stock of what they managed to recover from the city in terms of materials. However, spy work done by &lt;a href=\"Cariel\"&gt;Cariel&lt;/a&gt; showed that the Elder Council never ordered an invasion, and that the invasion was prompted by the &lt;a href=\"Stonefire%20Cult\"&gt;Stonefire Cult&lt;/a&gt;, who followed the words of &lt;a href=\"Javad%20Tharn\"&gt;Javad Tharn&lt;/a&gt;. The &lt;a href=\"Arenthian%20Resistance\"&gt;Arenthian Resistance&lt;/a&gt; used this information to inform the Colovians that their leader was in league with a &lt;a href=\"Daedric%20Prince\"&gt;Daedric Prince&lt;/a&gt;, because of the Colovian's high faith in the &lt;a href=\"Divines\"&gt;Divines&lt;/a&gt;. Shortly after the truth was leaked through the use of Centurion Gavo, the majority of the Colovians went back to &lt;a href=\"Cyrodiil%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Cyrodiil&lt;/a&gt;, with only the General's loyalist core remaining, the Arenthian Resistane fought back and reclaimed Arenthia.\n&lt;a href=\"Oath%20of%20Excision\"&gt;In Vinedusk Village&lt;/a&gt;.\nVinedusk Village was being invaded by elite Colovian forces, specifically, the Vlastarus Cohort, which split off from the main army assaulting Arenthia to attack Vinedusk Village. This was possible due to the &lt;a href=\"Vinedusk%20Ranger\"&gt;Vinedusk Ranger&lt;/a&gt;s being spread thin across the Dominion and into Cyrodiil. The Rangers were using two methods of counterattacks, burning the Colovians away from the Village, and then taking them by surprise in their camp. The burning of the village took out a significant portion of the Colovian forces, and bought the Rangers some time to plan their next attack.\n&lt;a href=\"Down%20the%20Skeever%20Hole\"&gt;At the Colovian Camp&lt;/a&gt;.\nIn the &lt;a href=\"Ayleid\"&gt;Ayleid&lt;/a&gt; tunnels beneath Vinedusk Village, the Colovian Force which had been attacking Vinedusk Village stored their supplies. However, they did not know about the secret tunnels of the Vinedusk Rangers, which got used to attack the Colovians from the middle of the camp. Upon leaving the ruins, the Rangers caused chaos in the camp. Following this, the Colovian Command, consisting of &lt;a href=\"Colonel%20Festius\"&gt;Colonel Festius&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Crispus\"&gt;Crispus&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Sabina\"&gt;Sabina&lt;/a&gt; was killed and the Colovians at Senalana were defeated.\n&lt;a href=\"Gates%20of%20Fire\"&gt;In Senalana&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe forces stationed at Arenthia dispatched a Legion force to go to the Ayleid ruins of &lt;a href=\"Senalana\"&gt;Senalana&lt;/a&gt;. They were sent there to obtain the &lt;a href=\"Grand%20Circlet%20of%20Elven%20Authority\"&gt;Grand Circlet of Elven Authority&lt;/a&gt;, which would have allowed them to take down the Dominion, piece by piece. However, Dominion scouts were spread throughout the Northern Wood and the Dominion was able to respond right away. The Colovians used ancient defense systems of the Ayleids, by pulling out &lt;a href=\"Welkynd%20Stone%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Welkynd Stones&lt;/a&gt; from their pedestals, a natural &lt;a href=\"ward\"&gt;ward&lt;/a&gt; appeared in front of the back entrance, which made it impossible for Dominion troops to enter and for &lt;a href=\"Razum-dar%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Razum-dar&lt;/a&gt; to leave. Upon taking the Circlet, the ruins started to collapse and the Colovians lost their goal of achieving the circlet."}

The name of the hold is derived from the proximity of its western location in relation to &lt;a href=\"Skyrim\"&gt;Skyrim&lt;/a&gt; and in particular, &lt;a href=\"The%20Reach\"&gt;The Reach&lt;/a&gt;.\nLocation.\nThe Western Reach is located in the farthest east side of High Rock, alongside the border of &lt;a href=\"Skyrim\"&gt;Skyrim&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Hammerfell\"&gt;Hammerfell&lt;/a&gt;. The area is rather cut off from other holds and provinces, being separated by the &lt;a href=\"Wrothgarian%20Mountains\"&gt;Wrothgarian Mountains&lt;/a&gt; to the west, the &lt;a href=\"Sea%20of%20Ghosts\"&gt;Sea of Ghosts&lt;/a&gt; to the north, the &lt;a href=\"Druadach%20Mountains\"&gt;Druadach Mountains&lt;/a&gt; to the East, and the &lt;a href=\"Dragontail%20Mountains\"&gt;Dragontail Mountains&lt;/a&gt; to the south, this has let the area develop its own unique culture.\n&lt;a href=\"Ephesus\"&gt;Ephesus&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Mournoth\"&gt;Mournoth&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Wrothgar\"&gt;Wrothgar&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Skyreach\"&gt;Skyreach&lt;/a&gt; together make up the region.\nHistory.\nThe Western Reach was first established as a hold by the Nords during the &lt;a href=\"Skyrim%20Conquests\"&gt;Skyrim Conquests&lt;/a&gt; after the land had been annexed into the &lt;a href=\"Ysgramor%20Dynasty\"&gt;First Empire of the Nords&lt;/a&gt;. After the &lt;a href=\"War%20of%20Succession\"&gt;War of Succession&lt;/a&gt; and the collapse of the Nordic Empire, the &lt;a href=\"Direnni%20Bloodline\"&gt;Direnni Elves&lt;/a&gt; reconquered the Western Reach and slaughtered the Nords that remained in the hold. The Direnni Elves turned the Western Reach into an impregnable barrier to keep out all who wished to invade the &lt;a href=\"Direnni%20Hegemony\"&gt;Direnni Hegemony&lt;/a&gt;, because of this the Western Reach remained as one of the longest elven controlled holds in High Rock. During the later years of the &lt;a href=\"Interregnum\"&gt;Interregnum&lt;/a&gt;, the Western Reach was one of &lt;a href=\"Tiber%20Septim\"&gt;Tiber Septim&lt;/a&gt;'s most notable opponents during his conquests. After the end of the Interregnum and the reformation of the Empire, the Western Reach was still plagued with large amounts of banditry and lawlessness, as well as attempted resistance to the Empire by the native Reachmen. The region was eventually calmed by the Provisional Governor, Titus Alorius.\nInhabitants.\nThe Western Reach was one of the first places where Nords and Elves bred. After years of inter-breeding between the Nords, Elves, and proto-Bretons a new race known as the &lt;a href=\"Reachmen\"&gt;Reachmen&lt;/a&gt; were born and eventually became the dominant race in the Western Reach. At some unspecified point in history large numbers of Reachmen began to immigrate into The Reach and eventually became the majority of the population within that region as well."}

Over the course of Svargrim's reign, the kingdom has seen attacks from &lt;a href=\"sea%20giant\"&gt;sea giant&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"Troll%20%28Online%29\"&gt;trolls&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Reachmen%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Reachmen&lt;/a&gt;, all of whom have failed to take territory from any of the holds. It is also alleged that the &lt;a href=\"Kamal\"&gt;Kamal&lt;/a&gt; chose not to attack Western Skyrim in favour of \"easier prey\" during the &lt;a href=\"Second%20Akaviri%20Invasion\"&gt;Second Akaviri Invasion&lt;/a&gt;.\nFollowing the reappearance of the &lt;a href=\"Gray%20Host\"&gt;Gray Host&lt;/a&gt;, Western Skyrim has been subject to attacks from &lt;a href=\"Vampire%20%28Online%29\"&gt;vampires&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Werewolf%20%28Online%29\"&gt;werewolves&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Icereach%20Coven\"&gt;witches&lt;/a&gt; who all conspire together to bring about the kingdom's fall, creating devastating &lt;a href=\"Harrowstorms\"&gt;Harrowstorms&lt;/a&gt; across the kingdom's surface and underground.\nLocations.\nThe following are locations accessible in Western Skyrim and, with the exception of &lt;a href=\"Unmarked%20Locations%20%28Online%29\"&gt;unmarked locations&lt;/a&gt;, are discoverable on the map. Points of Interest serve as locations with unique side quests, while &lt;a href=\"Cities%20%28Online%29\"&gt;cities&lt;/a&gt; serve as the centralised areas with multiple sublocations and act as a hub for services and &lt;a href=\"Merchants%20%28Online%29\"&gt;merchants&lt;/a&gt;. Explanations of the types of locations are provided in the &lt;a href=\"Locations%20%28Online%29%23Types\"&gt;main locations page&lt;/a&gt;.\nQuests.\nWestern Skyrim features a series of zone story quests and unrelated side quests. The zone story quests tie into the &lt;a href=\"Dark%20Heart%20of%20Skyrim\"&gt;Dark Heart of Skyrim&lt;/a&gt; overarching storyline and continues on to the &lt;a href=\"The%20Reach%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Reach&lt;/a&gt;, but it is not necessary to complete the story quests for zones prior to those in Western Skyrim. Side quests are non-sequential and can be completed in any order, except where one carries on from another, and &lt;a href=\"repeatable%20quests\"&gt;repeatable quests&lt;/a&gt; can be completed multiple times: weekly for arenas and trials and daily for all others.\nItem Sets.\nItem sets are related armor and weapons that, when worn together, provide unique benefits. Overland sets can be acquired from world bosses, world events, delves, public dungeons and containers and as quest rewards; dungeon sets can be acquired from within group dungeons; monster sets can be acquired from the final boss of veteran group dungeons and Undaunted Enclaves; and crafted sets can be created at specific locations across the zone.\nSkyshards.\nEleven Skyshards can be found in Western Skyrim totaling in three &lt;a href=\"skill%20points\"&gt;skill points&lt;/a&gt; with two left over. The zone guide provides clues as to the location of each Skyshard, but many can be found simply by exploring and watching for the distinctive pillar of light they emit. Skyshards will appear on the map and compass when the Vestige is close to one and will remain discovered on the map even if it was not collected.\nAchievements.\nAchievements can be earned by completing specific tasks such as completing quests and discovering locations. Achievements are separated into categories and their progress is viewable from the journal. Earning achievement provides the Vestige a number of points, and some achievements unlock unique rewards such as &lt;a href=\"Furnishings%20%28Online%29\"&gt;furnishings&lt;/a&gt; that can be bought from Achievement Furnishers or &lt;a href=\"collectibles\"&gt;collectibles&lt;/a&gt;.\nShalidor's Library.\nTen books that are a part of Shalidor's Library can be found in Western Skyrim and added to the collection. Books that have already been found in other zones will already be marked as completed in the zone tracker.\nFish.\nFish can be caught from fishing hotspots, ideally with the correct &lt;a href=\"bait\"&gt;bait&lt;/a&gt;. Common fish will be caught most often while rare fish and alternative bait are rare catches. Each zone has unique rare fish than can be caught from hotspots. &lt;a href=\"Slaughterfish%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Slaughterfish&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"trodh\"&gt;trodh&lt;/a&gt; can be caught from foul hotspots, &lt;a href=\"dhufish\"&gt;dhufish&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"longfin\"&gt;longfin&lt;/a&gt; can be caught from saltwater hotspots, &lt;a href=\"silverside%20perch\"&gt;silverside perch&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"spadetail\"&gt;spadetail&lt;/a&gt; can be caught from lake hotspots, and &lt;a href=\"Salmon%20%28Online%29\"&gt;salmon&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"River%20Betty%20%28Online%29\"&gt;river betty&lt;/a&gt; can be caught from river hotspots. &lt;a href=\"Chub\"&gt;Chub&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"minnow\"&gt;minnow&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"shad\"&gt;shad&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"fish%20roe\"&gt;fish roe&lt;/a&gt; can be caught and used as bait from foul, saltwater, lake and river hotspots, respectively."}

Continuing south from there would lead to the &lt;a href=\"Crypt%20of%20Hearts\"&gt;Crypt of Hearts&lt;/a&gt;, a long-forgotten school of Destruction Magic and other forms of combat, turned the source of the region's wickedness.\nHistory.\n&lt;a href=\"Second%20Era\"&gt;Second Era&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe people of Markwasten Moor and the &lt;a href=\"Shornhelm\"&gt;Shornhelm&lt;/a&gt; heights have a long history together, and with the coming of &lt;a href=\"King%20Ranser%27s%20War\"&gt;King Ranser's War&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"2E%20566\"&gt;2E 566&lt;/a&gt;, the Bretons of the Moor rallied against the Daggerfall Covenant. After the failed &lt;a href=\"Siege%20of%20Wayrest%20%282E%20566%29\"&gt;Siege of Wayrest&lt;/a&gt;, King Ranser's army retreated into Rivenspire, attempting to return into Shornhelm, but only found it razed by the Covenant. With no place left, the Army fled to Markwasten Moor, where they would be cornered by the Covenant and the &lt;a href=\"Orsimer\"&gt;Orsimer&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"Wrothgar\"&gt;Wrothgar&lt;/a&gt;, led by &lt;a href=\"Kurog%20gro-Bagrakh\"&gt;Kurog gro-Bagrakh&lt;/a&gt;. A large chunk of Ranser's Army was defeated, forcing Ranser's remaining few soldiers to flee a &lt;a href=\"Traitor%27s%20Tor\"&gt;nameless tor&lt;/a&gt;, which he would be killed by the treacherous &lt;a href=\"General%20Dathieu\"&gt;General Dathieu&lt;/a&gt;. That area became known as the Traitor's Tor after the conflict.\nDuring the &lt;a href=\"Interregnum\"&gt;Interregnum&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"2E%20582\"&gt;2E 582&lt;/a&gt;, the Bretons of &lt;a href=\"House%20Montclair\"&gt;House Montclair&lt;/a&gt; waged a civil war with the &lt;a href=\"Daggerfall%20Covenant\"&gt;Daggerfall Covenant&lt;/a&gt; and the Kingdom of Rivenspire. With powerful magic, &lt;a href=\"Count%20Verandis%20Ravenwatch\"&gt;Count Verandis Ravenwatch&lt;/a&gt; had sought ways to deal with the threat that &lt;a href=\"Wylon%20Montclair\"&gt;Wylon Montclair&lt;/a&gt; had posed. Ravenwatch's memories were stripped from him by Montclair, should the time come when he would be dealt with. Eventually, Verandis remembered something about &lt;a href=\"Lorkrata%20Hills\"&gt;Lorkrata Hills&lt;/a&gt; and traveled there, deep in the Westmark Moor. In the Hills, Verandis learned about the &lt;a href=\"Remnant%20of%20Light\"&gt;Remnant of Light&lt;/a&gt;, which was a powerful artifact created by the &lt;a href=\"Ayleid\"&gt;Ayleid&lt;/a&gt;s. House Montclair was used as a vassal by the object, corrupting it and making Wylon Montclair a dangerous threat. With the information, Verandis seeks to destroy the Lightless Remnant and saving Rivenspire for the better good.\n&lt;a href=\"Third%20Era\"&gt;Third Era&lt;/a&gt;.\nDuring the &lt;a href=\"Imperial%20Simulacrum\"&gt;Imperial Simulacrum&lt;/a&gt; from &lt;a href=\"3E%20389\"&gt;3E 389&lt;/a&gt; to &lt;a href=\"3E%20399\"&gt;3E 399&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Emperor\"&gt;Emperor&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Uriel%20Septim%20VII\"&gt;Uriel Septim VII&lt;/a&gt; was imprisoned along with &lt;a href=\"Talin%20Warhaft\"&gt;Talin Warhaft&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;a href=\"Deadlands\"&gt;Deadlands&lt;/a&gt; by &lt;a href=\"Jagar%20Tharn\"&gt;Jagar Tharn&lt;/a&gt;. Tharn planned for months to capture the throne, and he was able to achieve so in the span of ten years. Tharn had a powerful weapon called the &lt;a href=\"Staff%20of%20Chaos\"&gt;Staff of Chaos&lt;/a&gt;, and he split it into nine pieces and scattered them across Tamriel, the staff was the only thing keeping Uriel Septim and Warhaft in &lt;a href=\"Oblivion\"&gt;Oblivion&lt;/a&gt;. A warrior escaped his clutches and traveled all corners of Tamriel to retrieve the missing pieces. The hero was known as the &lt;a href=\"Eternal%20Champion\"&gt;Eternal Champion&lt;/a&gt;, and he assembled the staff and defeated Jagar Tharn at the &lt;a href=\"Imperial%20Palace\"&gt;Imperial Palace&lt;/a&gt;. The Eternal Champion had at one point visited the town of Markwasten Moor in their quest to recover the pieces."}
