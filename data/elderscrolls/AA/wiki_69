Tall tales of faraway places, great beasts, vast treasures, beautiful temptresses, and storms that could end the world. Many take these claims with a healthy dose of skepticism, but not all the legends you hear are pure fantasy. Away from the relative calm of the &lt;a href=\"Iliac%20Bay\"&gt;Iliac Bay&lt;/a&gt; the sea can harbor some truly frightening things. Among them are the &lt;a href=\"Maormer\"&gt;Maormer&lt;/a&gt; leviathans.\nIf you've never seen a &lt;a href=\"Sea%20Elf\"&gt;Sea Elf&lt;/a&gt;, they're strange, but unremarkable. Similar to &lt;a href=\"Altmer%20%28Online%29\"&gt;High Elves&lt;/a&gt; in build, their skin is the color of ocean spray and their eyes pale. Most wouldn't give them a second glance if not for their elaborate tattoos and their vicious demeanor. The ones their kind call leviathans, however, they'll make your blood run as cold as their own.\nThe spawn of some unholy and sorcerous coupling of Sea Elf and &lt;a href=\"Sea%20Serpent\"&gt;Sea Serpent&lt;/a&gt;, these giants stand a head and a half over the most towering of Nords when they draw themselves to their full height. A rare sight since these Elves mostly carry themselves in a beastly posture, bent and arced like a snake ready to strike. When they do make their move, they don't so much stride as slither along in an uneven predatory lope\u2014like they're unused to both land and legs.\nThe first time I laid eyes on one in the flesh, she was clambering up the hull of my ship like a centipede\u2014weaving back and forth as she effortlessly glided up the slippery boards. The way the light glittered off her blue scales was almost beautiful, but her dead, white eyes were as impassive as a shark's and her grin as mirthless.\nI doubled over in fright as she shot over the starboard railing. She was on me in an instant, pinning me to the deck with her great size, ready to strike me down with a killing blow, or so I thought. Instead, she regarded me with a chilling dispassion and I froze like a mouse that's locked eyes with a snake. I was both captivated and terrified. It was the popping of her jaw stretching out of place to swallow me that finally snapped me out of my shock and gave me the sense to struggle.\nI was no match for the leviathan's strength, but I managed to wrest a hand free and drive it into the back of her throat. The gout of flame she choked on put an end to her perverse existence, but the mark she left on me I'll carry until the end of my days. If you should ever see the scaled Elves lurking below the waves, my prayers go with you."}

The &lt;a href=\"Vestige\"&gt;Vestige&lt;/a&gt; meets a mysterious &lt;a href=\"Melar%20Sadus\"&gt;stranger&lt;/a&gt; near the gate of &lt;a href=\"Suran%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Suran&lt;/a&gt;, who claims to be investigating corruption within Suran's justice system.\nBackground.\n\"According to a masked vigilante known as the Scarlet Judge, a corrupt marshal named &lt;a href=\"Marshal%20Hlaren\"&gt;Hlaren&lt;/a&gt; is oppressing the citizens of Suran. I must aid the Judge in rooting out this corruption. The Judge wants me to speak to one of Marshal Hlaren's prisoners. They could provide valuable insight into Hlaren's misconduct. They should be laboring in a field nearby.\"\nWalkthrough.\nWhen first entering Suran, the Vestige will be able to meet a mysterious stranger standing near the gates of Suran. Initially, he will act reticent towards them, but he will eventually give the reason of his presence in Suran:\n\"Keep your weapons sheathed, citizen. The situation is well in hand, I assure you.\"\nThe Vestige will then need to speak to one of Marshal Hlaren's prisoners, who can be found in a nearby plantation. This plantation will be guarded by several Iron Hound mercenaries and Overseer Torvayn. The Iron Hound mercenaries will be hostile, but will not be difficult to avoid. The prisoner, &lt;a href=\"Ghamosh\"&gt;Ghamosh&lt;/a&gt;, can be found chopping wood in the southern area of the search area. Initially, he will think the Vestige is a slaver, begging them to \"Stay their lash.\" After asking Ghamosh what is going on, he will refuse to speak to the Vestige unless they kill Overseer Torvayn, because he has surely seen them speak and will undoubtedly kill Ghamosh. Torvayn can be found standing on a wooden platform overlooking the plantation. He will immediately turn hostile on sight. After defeating Torvayn, the Vestige must return to Ghamosh and speak to him:\n\"I saw you strike down Overseer Torvayn. Well fought, friend. If ever an &lt;a href=\"Elf\"&gt;Elf&lt;/a&gt; \"had it coming,\" it was Torvayn.\"\nHave you seen anything I can use against her? Anything specific? \"Maybe. These damned &lt;a href=\"Dunmer%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Dark Elves&lt;/a&gt; think I'm nothing but an animal\u2014some don't even think I can speak. Makes them careless around me. Mistress Dren's been shouting about the quality of her \"laborers.\" You might find something of value in her manor.\"\nAfter getting Ghamosh's testimony, the Vestige will have to speak to two more of Marshal Hlaren's prisoners; &lt;a href=\"Friga%20Bearfist\"&gt;Friga Bearfist&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Biene%20Diel\"&gt;Biene Diel&lt;/a&gt;. Friga can be found shoveling near the wooden fence guarding the ridge of the plantation. She will thank the Vestige for killing Overseer Torvayn, saying she \"Won't miss that horse's arse.\" After asking Friga if she was falsely imprisoned, she will explain that it is a matter of perspective; she punched a Dunmer, breaking his jaw in three places. That Dunmer turned out to be plantation master Arano, who had requested Friga would \"service\" his guards. Marshal Hlaren had told her she could shorten her prison sentence by doing hard labor on one of the plantations; a lie. After getting Friga's testimony, the Vestige will have to find Biene, who can be found raking leaves near a large tree. She will be surprised upon hearing of Torvayn's death. Furthermore, Biene will explain that she does not belong on the plantation, and was falsely accused of murdering a beggar the first day she arrived in Suran. Because the &lt;a href=\"Suran%20Prison\"&gt;Suran Prison&lt;/a&gt; is still under construction, she had to serve her prison sentence by working on the plantations. She will then point the Vestige towards &lt;a href=\"Master%20Kharek%27s%20Residence\"&gt;Master Kharek's Residence&lt;/a&gt;, which Marshal Hlaren visits once a week.\nWhen inside, the Vestige will find a \"&lt;a href=\"Letter%20to%20Kharekh%20gra-Bagrat\"&gt;Letter to Kharekh gra-Bagrat&lt;/a&gt;\". Consigned by Marshal Hlaren, it shows Hlaren has been arresting travelers on false accusations, so that they can become laborers for Master Kharekh gra-Bagrat. Hlaren tells her that they cannot just arrest anyone, as arresting someone with a powerful family behind them, or someone who is able to fight the charges, could uncover their arrangement quickly. She will explain a number of refugees from &lt;a href=\"Cyrodiil%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Cyrodiil&lt;/a&gt; will pass through Suran the next day, and that she is sure she will be able to arrest several of them.\nAfter picking up the note, the Vestige must go to &lt;a href=\"Mistress%20Dren%27s%20Residence\"&gt;Mistress Dren's Residence&lt;/a&gt;, which will be guarded by several Iron Hound mercenaries. They will turn hostile on sight, but will not be difficult to avoid. Once inside, a \"&lt;a href=\"Letter%20to%20Marshal%20Hlaren\"&gt;Letter to Marshal Hlaren&lt;/a&gt;\" will reveal that Dren is unsatisfied with the quality of her laborers. She will ask Hlaren to bring her \"a few of those strong Nords you sent over to Kharekh.\" Both Dren and Kharekh have agreed to Marshal Hlaren's \"work for compensation\" plan, so she finds it unfair that her laborers are of a lesser quality than those of Kharekh gra-Bagrat. She will direct the Marshal to a group of Nords who will be traveling through Suran the next day, urging her to arrest them.\nAfter having found both pieces of evidence, the Vestige must meet the Scarlet Judge at Ules Manor, where they will discuss their next move. Once inside, the Judge can be found standing in front of a bookcase. When spoken to, he will say the following:\n\"Ah. True to your word. I knew I could trust you. I led the Iron Hounds on a merry chase, but I doubt they'll stay scattered for long. What of your search? Did you find any evidence of Hlaren's corruption?\"\nThe Vestige must now travel to the Daedric ruins north of Suran to raid the Iron Hounds camp located there. Once there, they must burn three weapon caches (weapon racks) and four supply crates, which will be scattered throughout the ruins. The ruins are filled with Iron Hound mercenaries, which can prove to be quite a challenge, notably Captain Cedus, a mercenary captain. After finding and destroying all weapon caches and supply crates, the Vestige must return to Suran, where they will be met by the aforementioned Constable Gretga. She will urge them to follow her, as they cannot speak openly out on the streets. After following her up a pair of stairs leading to a remote building, she will tell the Vestige the following:\n\"Sorry about this cloak and dagger nonsense. I can't be seen talking to someone even remotely suspicious right now. Marshal Hlaren's watching me like a hawk.\"\nThe Vestige now has three options; Speak with Dredyni in Desele's House of Earthly Delights, who will point the Vestige towards Constable Mirel, a constable who recently went missing and is rumored to have \"ran afoul with some skooma dealers.\" He had a key to the prison. After locating Mirel, however, it will be apparent that he is dead, his corpse lying on a remote beach near Suran. The key will be in a pile of recently disturbed dirt. The second option is to intimidate Remas Belan into making a copy of the Suran Prison key, note that he will only agree to do so after being asked if he \"Would like to keep his knees intact.\" \nThe third option is to bribe Constable Kren, who can be found at the bar of Desele's House of Earthly Delights. He will be easily persuaded and will give the Vestige the key to the prison for a &lt;a href=\"leveled\"&gt;leveled&lt;/a&gt; amount of . After gaining possession of the key, the Vestige must enter the Suran Prison. Note that entering the Suran Prison counts as trespassing, and will cause the Vestige to receive a bounty.\nAfter avoiding or fighting the hired guards within the Suran Prison, the Vestige will eventually meet a man named Melar Sadus. Visibly in pain, he will be sitting on a wooden chair surrounded by torture tools. When spoken to, he will tell the Vestige the following:\n\"Ah, my friend. I see Constable Gretga found you. Please, forgive me if I don't stand up. The marshal's henchmen broke my knees as soon as I arrived. It is good to meet you, face to face. I wish it was under better circumstances.\"\nThe Vestige will now have to travel to the fortress ruin of &lt;a href=\"Marandus%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Marandus&lt;/a&gt;, where Warden Libo has set up camp. Marandus lies directly north-west of the &lt;a href=\"Suran%20Wayshrine\"&gt;Suran Wayshrine&lt;/a&gt;.\nOnce there, the Vestige has to pass through the ruins, and walk towards the lake, where they will find Warden Libo and an Iron Hound mercenary. Both Libo and the mercenary will turn hostile on sight.\nAfter defeating Libo, the Vestige must take the key to his trophy chest from his body and open the chest near the large tree. After gaining possession of the Judge's regalia, the Vestige must put it on and return to Constable Gretga, who will be waiting for them in Suran.\nWhen spoken to, she will tell the Vestige the following:\n\"Now there's a sight for sore eyes. The Scarlet Judge returns! You wear it well! Better than Melar, even. But don't tell him I said that.\"\nThe Vestige must travel to Inanius Egg Mine and enter it through its back entrance. Inside are several Iron Hound mercenaries, as well as many &lt;a href=\"Kwama%20Worker%20%28Online%29\"&gt;kwama workers&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Kwama%20Warrior%20%28Online%29\"&gt;kwama warriors&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe first piece of evidence, the \"Letter to Kharekh gra-Bagrat\", can be found in a broken crate, guarded by an Iron Hound mercenary. The second letter, the \"Letter to Marshal Hlaren\", is located in a wooden crate on a platform overlooking the mine. The third and final piece of evidence, the \"Slave Testimony\", can be found in a wooden crate also.\nThe Vestige must take all pieces of evidence, so that they can be used against the Marshal later.\nAfter finding all three pieces of evidence, the Vestige must confront Marshal Hlaren near the front entrance of the mine. Initially, all three plantation owners can be seen speaking to her, but they will immediately flee once the Vestige approaches. After successfully defeating Hlaren, the Vestige must exit the mine through the front entrance, where they will be met by Constable Gretga:\n\"We caught these three trying to slip away. Should have seen their faces! It's a big risk arresting Suran's most powerful landowners. I'm hoping you've got the evidence to make it worthwhile. Where's Marshal Hlaren?\"\nNow that the three corrupt plantation owners have been arrested, the Vestige must return to Suran and find Melar. He can be found sitting on a wooden bench near the Suran Stables. When spoken to, he will tell the Vestige the following:\n\"Greetings, my friend. You cut quite the dashing figure in my old regalia! Another spectecular victory for the Scarlet Judge, eh? I will miss donning the cowl, but it does me good knowing my final adventure helped liberate the people of Suran.\"\nAfterwards, the quest will be completed, and the Vestige may receive their reward."}

It starts when the &lt;a href=\"Nerevarine\"&gt;Nerevarine&lt;/a&gt; agrees to help a &lt;a href=\"Bosmer%20%28Morrowind%29\"&gt;Bosmer&lt;/a&gt; traveler, &lt;a href=\"Thoronor\"&gt;Thoronor&lt;/a&gt;, to find his lost friend.\nBackground.\nNear the &lt;a href=\"Fields%20of%20Kummu%20%28Morrowind%20Location%29\"&gt;Fields of Kummu&lt;/a&gt;, the Bosmer scholar &lt;a href=\"Thoronor\"&gt;Thoronor&lt;/a&gt; can be encountered alone on the road. If spoken to, he asks the Nerevarine to look for his friend &lt;a href=\"Edras%20Oril\"&gt;Edras Oril&lt;/a&gt;. It seems that Edras, who is an amateur naturalist, has wandered off to investigate strange animal sounds. Thoronor hasn't seen him since and fears for Edras' life.\nDetailed walkthrough.\nWhen the Nerevarine talks to Thoronor on the road near the Fields of Kummu, he asks them to find his friend Edras Oril. The player can also go direclty to Edras without having spoken with Thoronor beforehand. He can be found not far east of the place where Thoronor stands. He hides from the group of Mating Kagouti he was observing and that is behaving aggressively.\nIf the Nerevarine talks to him, he will refuse to follow them back to Thoronor because he is afraid the kagouti will attack him again. The Nerevarine must either kill them or cast a spell of &lt;a href=\"Invisibility%20%28Morrowind%29\"&gt;invisibility&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"Chameleon%20%28Morrowind%29\"&gt;chameleon&lt;/a&gt; on Edras. If the player has refused to help Edras, the quest can still be completed as long as a spell of invisibility is cast on Edras. Of course it is likely that the Nerevarine has already encountered the animals and killed them. On the way, he might also have found Edras Oril's notes about his observations, the book \"&lt;a href=\"Kagouti%20Mating%20Habits\"&gt;Kagouti Mating Habits&lt;/a&gt;\".\nWhen the kagouti are neutralized, Edras Oril will follow the Nerevarine back to Thoronor. Thoronor will reward the Nerevarine with an enchanted amulet. If Edras has been killed, Thoronor will give the player a book instead.\nReward.\nThoronor will present the Nerevarine with an &lt;a href=\"Amulet%20of%20Slowfalling\"&gt;Amulet of Slowfalling&lt;/a&gt; as a reward. In the case that Edras does not survive, the player is awarded with a copy of \"&lt;a href=\"2920%2C%20vol%2005%20-%20Second%20Seed\"&gt;2920, vol 05 - Second Seed&lt;/a&gt;\"."}

If the summoning occurs on the 5th of First Seed, the Agent may receive a vision of Hermaeus Mora, whom immediately offers them a quest. Indeed, Hermaeus Mora is keen to reward the Agent with the power of the \"&lt;a href=\"Oghma%20Infinium%20%28Daggerfall%29\"&gt;Oghma Infinium&lt;/a&gt;\", if they should they \"exterminate a certain scrofulous patrician.\"\nAn Empowered Noble.\nUpon the Agent's acceptance of the task, Hermaeus Mora will outline that the \"scrofulous patrician\" is a noble, living in the palace of a nearby town. Once the noble lies dead, Hermaeus Mora instructs the Agent to seek out one of the Princes apostles, who resides in a library in another town. With that, Mora's vision will end and the Agent should head out to slay the noble.\nThe noble will appear in the specified palace in the form of a &lt;a href=\"Spellsword%20%28Daggerfall%29\"&gt;spellsword&lt;/a&gt;, apparently on their own. Upon striking the spellsword the noble will suddenly plead:\n\"No! Wait! I swear, I meant to pay Lord Mora back. Don't kill me, I beg of you! Here, spare my life and take this [enchanted item] back to him as a token of my goodwill and a down payment on what I owe.

The Agent will then be harassed by &lt;a href=\"Barbarian%20%28Daggerfall%29\"&gt;barbarians&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Ranger%20%28Daggerfall%29\"&gt;rangers&lt;/a&gt; until they speak with Hermaeus Mora's contact, found in the library of another town.

The Agent must therefore head to apostle's town, find them in the library and hand them the item, although the apostle does not seem interested:\n\"Hmm, well, thanks for the [enchanted item], I guess... Now, let's get down to business.\"\nThe apostle will be even less impressed when the Agent reveals that the noble has not been slain. Indeed, the Agent will berated for letting \"that little worm live\" resulting in no reward and the quest ending in failure.\nRewards.\nCompleting the quest successfully within the time limit will see the Agent rewarded with the \"Oghma Infinium\" by the Prince's apostle. The Agent will also receive a boost in reputation with the faction whom summoned the Prince for them, as well as the faction's associates. Conversely, failing the quest will result in the Agent losing reputation with the summoner's faction.\nThe changes made to reputation, either by successfully completing or failing the quest are shown below:"}

An engine that drives the will of change, inevitable, primordial. An ever-moving force in an ever-constant cycle. To mark the progression of that change is a thing most sacred to the &lt;a href=\"Argonians%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Saxhleel&lt;/a&gt;. Each month marks a particular aspect of the yearly cycle, and is thus celebrated accordingly. The months and their respective meanings are as follows:\nVakka (Sun)As the first month of the cycle, Vakka is associated with the primordial origin of existence, or origins in general. We are encouraged to show extra respect to the tribal elders during this time.\nXeech (Nut)Also known as the hiding time, Xeech is a month of planting both seeds and ideals. Swamp bulbs are buried, planting sprouts. Elders pass down their knowledge, implanting knowledge. This is a time of hope, but also of melancholy. It is the first of the Three Mournings, for once a thing it is planted, it is hidden and gone. What emerges will not be something new: the nut is lost forever.\nSisei (Sprout)Sisei stands for newness, possibility, and youthful excitement. The &lt;a href=\"Hist\"&gt;Hist&lt;/a&gt; has shed its sleeping life and now is truly alive. Many hatchling festivals take place during this time. It is also known as the \"leaping season,\" for this month is also full of sport and competition. The virtues of strength, speed, and willpower are all venerated and celebrated.\nHist-Deek (Hist Sapling)Hist-Deek is, for good or ill, dedicated to the challenge of authority and the power of individual agency. Many use this month to highlight injustices, with intra-tribal conflict often resulting. Needless to say, it is a very controversial time. Many also take this time to analyze their agency apart from the Hist; to reflect upon our worship, and see it as bond rather than bondage.\nHist-Dooka (Mature Hist)Serving as the counter-balance to the turbulent Hist-Deek, the Hist-Dooka is centered on the ideas of family, tradition, and obligation. Young Saxhleel are given more responsibility, and many adolescents take on the Chukka-Sei, a trial of maturation, to prove themselves worthy of being called an adult. Those who pass the trials are gain full tribal membership, and the month typically ends with a great celebration.\nHist-Tsoko (Elder Hist)Perhaps the holiest month of the year, Hist-Tsoko is dedicated to the ideas of knowledge, wisdom, and fullness of potential. Many gatherings this month are solemn affairs, the most important being the Root Talk, where the tribal elders recite the history of the Saxhleel. This month also stands as the Second Mourning, due to the fact that the Hist has stopped growing and all of its individual potential is expended.\nThtithil-Gah (Egg-Basket)Thtithil-Gah is a month of foolishness and frivolity, often a welcome respite from the oppressive solemnity of the Hist-Tsoko. Hatchling-like wonder, youthful joy, and mild confusion are all venerated. Many traveling entertaining troupes make the majority of their profit during this time. Festivals and feasts are nearly constant.\nThtithil (Egg)The Egg month is associated with mystery, anticipation, and (perhaps oddly) finality. For most tribes, the connection is literal; much egg-laying takes place during this month.\nNushmeeko (Lizard)The lizard symbolizes swift and quiet labor. Nushmeeko celebrates the thankless tasks of everyday life, and work is near constant. Cleaning, building, repairing, and preparing; every member of the tribe puts their snout to the grindstone and pushes.\nShaja-Nushmeeko (Semi-Humanoid Lizard)This month, like Hist-Deek earlier, is another of mystery and debate. There is significant controversy about what the humanoid-lizard actually represents. Is it a hatchling emerged from the egg, or a representation of our cultural origins? Unifying concepts such as change, becoming, and shifting values are all contemplated. Appropriately, many adolescent gatherings take place during this time, resulting in various romantic entanglements. The awkwardness of youth is often associated with this month.\nSaxhleel (&lt;a href=\"Argonians%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Argonian&lt;/a&gt;)Saxhleel is a month associated with the true passions of our culture. Given that the hunting and harvesting season has passed, tribe members are free to focus on pursuits such as pottery, woodcarving, and other creative pastimes. A sense of things coming to a close is pervasive, and in many tribes there is a large gathering of elders at the end of this month. The intent of the festival is to prepare both our elders and community for the impending deaths to come. Dryskins often find this a morbid tradition.\nXulomaht (The Deceased)Like many traditions, Xulomaht is a month of apparently conflicting ideas. It is associated with the Third Mourning, the most powerful of the three given the literal ending of the year. Tribes look back on the events of the year and come to terms with its passing. However, it is also a time of celebration and remembrances. Great festivals are held in honor of all who have passed from their old life and into a new one. Much of the month is spent planning and preparing for these festivities."}

What do we know for sure?\nOne: We know that there are multiple realms in Akavir, and that the &lt;a href=\"Tsaesci\"&gt;raiders&lt;/a&gt; of the &lt;a href=\"First%20Era\"&gt;First Era&lt;/a&gt; (who later gave the Empire its &lt;a href=\"Potentate\"&gt;Potentate&lt;/a&gt;s) were from Tsaesci, while the &lt;a href=\"Kamal\"&gt;forces&lt;/a&gt; of the recent invasion were from &lt;a href=\"Kamal\"&gt;Kamal&lt;/a&gt;. However, we know virtually nothing about either realm.\nTwo: The leader of this second invasion was the King of Kamal, &lt;a href=\"Ada%27Soom%20Dir-Kamal\"&gt;Ada'Soom Dir-Kamal&lt;/a&gt;. We know little about him or his reasons for invading Tamriel, even from our agents in the Eastern Kingdom: few captured &lt;a href=\"Akaviri\"&gt;Akaviri&lt;/a&gt; knew any Tamrielic, and most died under interrogation. One report stated that Dir-Kamal was seeking someone or something called the \"&lt;a href=\"Ordained%20Receptacle\"&gt;Ordained Receptacle&lt;/a&gt;\"\u2015but this could easily be a bungled translation.\nThree: For reasons unknown, the Akaviri fleet sailed around the northeast corner of Tamriel into the &lt;a href=\"Sea%20of%20Ghosts\"&gt;Sea of Ghosts&lt;/a&gt;, bypassing the &lt;a href=\"Telvanni%20Peninsula\"&gt;Telvanni Peninsula&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Vvardenfell%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Vvardenfell&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Solstheim\"&gt;Solstheim&lt;/a&gt;, before finally landing at the mouth of the &lt;a href=\"White%20River\"&gt;White River&lt;/a&gt; northeast of &lt;a href=\"Windhelm%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Windhelm&lt;/a&gt;.\nFour: The invasion was a complete surprise, and Windhelm was invested before &lt;a href=\"Queen%20Mabjaarn\"&gt;Queen Mabjaarn&lt;/a&gt; could muster the &lt;a href=\"Eastmarch%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Hold&lt;/a&gt; in defense. After a brief siege the invaders breached the southern gate and the city was sacked and burned. Both Queen Mabjaarn and her daughter and heir, Princess &lt;a href=\"Nurnhilde\"&gt;Nurnhilde&lt;/a&gt;, were slain in fierce fighting before the gates of the &lt;a href=\"Palace%20of%20the%20Kings\"&gt;Palace of the Kings&lt;/a&gt;.\nFive: The royal cadet, Prince &lt;a href=\"Jorunn\"&gt;Jorunn&lt;/a&gt;, escaped the sack of Windhelm and briefly disappeared. When he reappeared he was calling himself King Jorunn, and was accompanied by a mighty warrior whom he claimed was &lt;a href=\"Wulfharth\"&gt;Wulfharth&lt;/a&gt; the Ash-King, sent back from &lt;a href=\"Sovngarde%20%28Location%29\"&gt;Sovngarde&lt;/a&gt; to help the Nords defeat the Akaviri. With this so-called Wulfharth at his side, Jorunn rallied the Eastern Nords and fortified &lt;a href=\"Riften%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Riften&lt;/a&gt;.\nSix: When Dir-Kamal moved his army south from Windhelm, he bypassed Riften\u2015once again, his motivations are unclear\u2015and marched into western Morrowind. They were opposed by Dark Elf forces, who staged a fighting retreat through the &lt;a href=\"Ashlands\"&gt;Ashlands&lt;/a&gt; under the command of &lt;a href=\"Almalexia%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Almalexia&lt;/a&gt; and her leading general, &lt;a href=\"Tanval%20Indoril\"&gt;Tanval&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"House%20Indoril%20%28Online%29\"&gt;House Indoril&lt;/a&gt;.\nSeven: Dir-Kamal pursued the Dunmeri army into eastern &lt;a href=\"Stonefalls%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Stonefalls&lt;/a&gt;, where the Elves halted their retreat by occupying prepared defenses. The Akaviri advance slowed and stopped\u2015and suddenly, the Nord army under Jorunn and \"Wulfharth\" appeared in their rear. This cannot have been by chance: incredibly, we must conclude that, despite the age-old enmity between Nord and Elf, there was collusion between Jorunn and Almalexia, and the envelopment of the Akaviri at Stonefalls was according to plan.\nEight: The Akaviri, however, were not easily defeated. With their backs to the &lt;a href=\"Inner%20Sea\"&gt;Inner Sea&lt;/a&gt;, they fought a desperate defense, attempting to hold out until their ships could come from the White River estuary to take them from the shore. Despite repeated attempts, the combined Dunmer-Nord army failed to break their lines. The Akaviri fleet was actually visible on the northern horizon when another incredible event occurred: at the last moment the Nords and Dark Elves were reinforced by two legions of &lt;a href=\"Argonians%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Argonians&lt;/a&gt; who had marched to the battle from the south. With the infusion of the reptilian &lt;a href=\"Shellbacks\"&gt;Shellbacks&lt;/a&gt;, the Tamrielics finally broke the Akaviri line\u2015and with nowhere to escape to, the invaders were slaughtered to the last soldier.\nAs Your Majesty no doubt realizes, this account raises far more questions than answers: what we know about this affair is dwarfed by what we don't know. Thus my request to fund a Royal Committee of Inquiry to look into the grave implications of this matter. I, of course, will volunteer to lead this committee, provided the burden of such a task can be offset by an appropriate stipend."}

No vegetation of any kind grew in Lorikh, though there were blackened vestiges of long dead trees scattered throughout the town. Kamdida arriving by caravan looked at her new home with despair. She was used to the forestland of the north where her father's family had haled. Here there was no shade, little water, and a great open sky. It looked like a dead land.\nHer mother's family took Kamdida and her younger brother Nevith in, and was very kind to the orphans, but she felt lonely in the alien village. It was not until she met an old &lt;a href=\"Argonian\"&gt;Argonian&lt;/a&gt; woman who worked at the water factory that Kamdida found a friend. Her name was Sigerthe, and she said that her family had lived in Lorikh centuries before the Dwemer arrived, when it was a great and beauteous forest.\n\"Why did the trees die?\" asked Kamdida.\n\"When there were Argonians only in this land, we never cut trees for we had no need for fuel or wooden structures such as you use. When the Dwemer came, we allowed them to use the plants as they needed them, provided they never touched the &lt;a href=\"Hist\"&gt;Hist&lt;/a&gt;, which are sacred to us and to the land. For many years, we lived peaceably. No one wanted for anything.\"\n\"What happened?\"\n\"Some of your scientists discovered that distilling a certain tree sap, molding it and drying it, they could create a resilient kind of armor called &lt;a href=\"resin\"&gt;resin&lt;/a&gt;,\" said Sigerthe. \"Most of the trees that grew here had very thin ichor in their branches, but not the Hist. Many of them fairly glistened with sap, which made the Dwemer merchants greedy. They hired a woodsman named Juhnin to start clearing the sacred arbors for profit.\"\nThe old Argonian woman looked to the dusty ground and sighed, \"Of course, we Argonians cried out against it. It was our home, and the Hist, once gone, would never return. The merchants reconsidered, but Juhnin took it on his own to break our spirit. He proved one terrible, bloody day that his prodigious skill with the axe could be used against people as well as trees. Any Argonian who stood in his way was hewn asunder, children as well. The Dwemer people of Lorikh closed their doors and their ears to the cries of murder.\"\n\"Horrible,\" gasped Kamdida.\n\"It is difficult to explain,\" said Sigerthe. \"But the deaths of our living ones was not nearly as horrible to us as the death of our trees. You must understand that to my people, the Hist are where we come from and where we are going. To destroy our bodies is nothing; to destroy our trees is to annihilate us utterly. When Juhnin then turned his axe on the Hist, he killed the land. The water disappeared, the animals died, and all the other life that the trees nourished crumbled and dried to dust.\"\n\"But you are still here?\" asked Kamdida. \"Why didn't you leave?\"\n\"For us, we are trapped. I am one of the last of a dying people. Few of us are strong enough to live away from our ancestral groves, and sometimes, even now, there is a perfume in the air of Lorikh that gives us life. It will not be long until we are all gone.\"\nKamdida felt tears welling up in her eyes. \"Then I will be alone in this horrible place with no trees and no friends.\"\n\"We Argonians have an expression,\" said Sigerthe with a sad smile, taking Kamdida's hand. \"That the best soil for a seed is found in your heart.\"\nKamdida looked into the palm of her hand and saw that Sigerthe had given her a small black pellet. It was a seed. \"It looks dead.\"\n\"It can only grow in one place in all Lorikh,\" said the old Argonian. \"Outside an old cottage in the hills outside town. I cannot go there, for the owner would kill me on sight and like all my people, I am too frail to defend myself now. But you can go there and plant the seed.\"\n\"What will happen?\" asked Kamdida. \"Will the Hist return?\"\n\"No. But some part of their power will.\"\nThat night, Kamdida stole from her house and into the hills. She knew the cottage Sigerthe had spoken of. Her aunt and uncle had told her never to go there. As she approached it, the door opened and an old but powerfully built man appeared, a mighty axe slung over his shoulder.\n\"What are you doing here, child?\" he demanded. \"In the dark, I almost took you to be a &lt;a href=\"lizard%20Man\"&gt;lizard man&lt;/a&gt;.\"\n\"I've lost my way in the dark,\" she said quickly. \"I'm trying to get back to my home in Lorikh.\"\n\"Be on your way then.\"\n\"Do you have a candle I might have?\" she asked piteously. \"I've been walking in circles and I'm afraid I'll only return back here without any light.\"\nThe old man grumbled and walked into his house. Quickly, Kamdida dug a hole in the dry dirt and buried the seed as deeply as she could. He returned with a lit candle.\n\"See to it you don't come back here,\" he growled. \"Or I'll chop you in half.\"\nHe returned to his house and fire. The next morning when he awoke and opened the door, he found that his cottage was entirely sealed within an enormous tree. He picked up his axe and delivered blow and after blow to the wood, but he could never break through. He tried side chops, but the wood healed itself. He tried an upper chop followed by an under chop to form a wedge, but the wood sealed.\nMuch time went by before someone discovered old Juhnin's emaciated body lying in front of his open door, still holding his blunted, broken axe. It was a mystery to all what he had been chopping with it, but the legend began circulating through Lorikh that Hist sap was found on the blade.\nShortly thereafter, small desert flowers began pushing through the dry dirt in the town. Trees and plants newly sown began to live tolerably well, if not luxuriantly. The Hist did not return, but Kamdida and the people of Lorikh noticed that at a certain time around twilight, long, wide shadows of great, bygone trees would fill the streets and hills.\nPublisher's Note\n\"\"The Seed\" is one of Marobar Sul's tales whose origins are well known. This tale originated from the Argonian slaves of southern &lt;a href=\"Morrowind\"&gt;Morrowind&lt;/a&gt;. \"Marobar Sul\" merely replaced the &lt;a href=\"Dunmer\"&gt;Dunmer&lt;/a&gt; with Dwemer and claimed he found it in a Dwemer ruin. Furthermore, he later claimed that the Argonian version of the tale was merely a retelling of his \"original!\"\"\nLorikh, while clearly not a Dwemer name, simply does not exist, and in fact \"Lorikh\" was a name commonly used, incorrectly, for Dunmer men in &lt;a href=\"Gor%20Felim\"&gt;Gor Felim&lt;/a&gt;'s plays. The Argonian versions of the story usually take place on &lt;a href=\"Vvardenfell\"&gt;Vvardenfell&lt;/a&gt;, usually in the &lt;a href=\"House%20Telvanni%20%28Morrowind%29\"&gt;Telvanni&lt;/a&gt; city of &lt;a href=\"Sadrith%20Mora\"&gt;Sadrith Mora&lt;/a&gt;. Of course the so-called \"scholars\" of &lt;a href=\"Temple%20Zero%20Society\"&gt;Temple Zero&lt;/a&gt; will probably claim this story has something to do with \"&lt;a href=\"Lorkhan\"&gt;Lorkhan&lt;/a&gt;\" simply because the town starts with the letter L."}

Each of these will have a crystal with a seal next to it; activate the seal and a beam will emerge from the crystal to the temple. Beware though, as each of the crystals is guarded by a powerful Anka-Ra boss. Once all three beams have been activated, you can head to the center and enter the temple. \nTalk to Ibrula once inside. She will tell you that this library is in fact a shrine to the Daedric Prince Hermaeus Mora, and that people who seek knowledge often come here to give the prince gifts in exchange for said knowledge. She believes that Mora will provide information on how to defeat the Celestials. Once you are done talking, fight your way through the hallways and deeper into the library. At the end of the hallway, you will need to jump down a hole to reach the shrine itself. Proceed ahead and you will find the shrine guarded by the &lt;a href=\"Glaring%20Eye\"&gt;Glaring Eye&lt;/a&gt;; kill it, then head up to the statue. Ibrula will offer her gift to Mora, and he will tell her he wishes to speak with you. \nTalk to the statue and he will tell you some of what you wish to know. He will tell you that the Anka-Ra are bound to a man named &lt;a href=\"Emperor%20Tarish-Zi\"&gt;Emperor Tarish-Zi&lt;/a&gt;, and that in order to defeat them, you must defeat him.

Upon freeing her she will tell you that the Maormer intend to use this lighthouse to communicate with their fleet as they invade &lt;a href=\"Vulkhel%20Guard%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Vulkhel Guard&lt;/a&gt;. She will ask you to free three of her scouts that are being held captive, and then to meet her on the beach. \n&lt;a href=\"Legionary%20Pandetuile\"&gt;Legionary Pandetuile&lt;/a&gt; will be to your south. After you free her, head northwest and you will find &lt;a href=\"Legionary%20Norfando\"&gt;Legionary Norfando&lt;/a&gt; by the tent. Finally, head north to rescue &lt;a href=\"Legionary%20Uulion\"&gt;Legionary Uulion&lt;/a&gt;; he will be behind a rock formation. With all three legionaries freed, head to the south to meet with the captain on the beach there. She will inform you that the lighthouse keeper, &lt;a href=\"Tildur\"&gt;Tildur&lt;/a&gt;, was spared by the Maormer, as they did not consider him a threat. Tildur has informed her that the Maormer are sending signals to their fleet; the captain wishes to put a stop to this at once. She has a plan to burn the lighthouse with kindlepitch and fire salts; she will direct you to Tildur as he knows where to find these things. \nYou do not actually need to talk to Tildur; quest markers will appear for these items after speaking with the captain. Fire Salts can be found in the ship you see in the distance. Head belowdecks and there will be a chest with the fire salts in the north. Beware the Maormer pirates on the ship though. For the kindlepitch, head south of the captain's location. There will be a cave there; head in and grab the kindlepitch from the bag. Once you have both of the items, head back to Captain Ciranya.\nCiranya has observed how the Maormer get past the ward they placed on the lighthouse door; they use a runestone to temporarily disable it. Your mission now is to take a runestone from the body of one of their patrols and then head into the lighthouse to set it ablaze. Ciranya will give you a teleportation scroll to get out once the lighthouse is on fire. The patrols in question can be found on the path up to the lighthouse; kill one and take his runestone. Continue up the stairs until you reach the lightouse, use the rune to dispel the ward, and then head in. Rou will be faced with two powerful enemies here; the Maormer leader &lt;a href=\"Heculoa\"&gt;Heculoa&lt;/a&gt; and his pet snake &lt;a href=\"Wenyand\"&gt;Wenyand&lt;/a&gt;. After both are dead, head through the door behind them to the beacon and drop your fire mixture in the fire. This will cause the lighthouse to go up in flames; use Ciranya's scroll to escape back to the beach.\nMaormer Pirate: \"Did you see that? The lighthouse beacon exploded!\"\nMaormer Pirate: \"I see it! The \u2026 the tower is on fire!\"\nMaormer Pirate: \"How did this happen? What will we do?\"\nBack on the beach, speak with Captain Ciranya to finish the quest."}

She tried to appeal to the Orc leaders, but diplomacy didn't work. Now she wants me to come along and try a more forceful approach.\"\nWalkthrough.\nUpon completing \"&lt;a href=\"A%20Leaf%20in%20the%20Wind\"&gt;A Leaf in the Wind&lt;/a&gt;,\" Little Leaf will tell you that the &lt;a href=\"Iron%20Orcs\"&gt;Iron Orcs&lt;/a&gt; are building an army of trolls for &lt;a href=\"The%20Serpent%20%28Celestial%29\"&gt;the Serpent&lt;/a&gt;. She tried to convince them to stop, but they took her gold and threw her out. Now that you are here, she thinks your proclivity for violence might provide a solution. She will ask to meet you in the nearby tower. This tower, Ilthag's Undertower, is a delve just up the hill. \nHead into the dungeon. You do not have to talk to Little Leaf upon entering, just progress through to the end and kill the boss, Ilthag Ironblood. You will notice at the start that both of the doors ahead are locked; you will have to jump beneath the floorboards to the room below to progress. Fight your way through to the boss, then kill him. Once he is dead, speak with Little Leaf. She will tell you to meet her in the &lt;a href=\"Valley%20of%20Scars\"&gt;Valley of Scars&lt;/a&gt; so you two can take down the other leaders of the Iron Orcs and put an end to the troll army. \nOnce you arrive, Little Leaf will tell you to go kill the Runescriber and the Armorer. Runescriber Kulth can be found in the northwest of the Iron Orc camp. He will be in his house, with his pet troll &lt;a href=\"Oruzkad\"&gt;Oruzkad&lt;/a&gt;. Armorer Uthik will be in the northeast, just east of the &lt;a href=\"Exarch%27s%20Stronghold\"&gt;Exarch's Stronghold&lt;/a&gt;. She has a pet Troll and &lt;a href=\"Welwa\"&gt;Welwa&lt;/a&gt; with her. Once both the Runescriber and the Armorer lie dead, Little Leaf will tell you to go after the Orc chief, &lt;a href=\"Exarch%20Braadoth\"&gt;Exarch Braadoth&lt;/a&gt;. He will be in the aforementioned Exarch's Stronghold. \nFight your way through this delve to the throne room. In the throne room, you will find Exarck Braadoth and his troll Kurzoth, alongside two Iron Orc shamans. Slay them to put an end to the troll threat. Once this is done, head back outside, and make sure to drop down to the lower level on the way and grab the skyshard if you have not done so already. Once you are back outside, speak with Little Leaf to finish the quest."}

For as far as any man's eyes, only &lt;a href=\"High%20Hrothgar\"&gt;High Hrothgar&lt;/a&gt; remained above the churning coils of dragon stop.\nAnd Alduin said, \"Ho ha ho.\"\nBut, look! Seven more mountains remained through &lt;a href=\"Skyrim\"&gt;Mereth&lt;/a&gt; like Hrothgaar and the Leaper Devil King (a kindly leaper demon, to be sure, but their king) jumped across the nilphony swirl. He came to Alduin (who always eats &lt;a href=\"Nords\"&gt;Nords&lt;/a&gt; first) and said, \"Wait, wait, wait! Wait! It is not time to destroy the world yet!\"\nTo which Alduin roared and laughed and said, \"King of Leapers, you always bounce up to me around this time (for you are one of the only spirits that can last til my last bite) and shout, 'Wait!', but I never do and I will not now. Leap up to Hrothgaar's top and wait awhile longer in little dignity. The two bells have went 'Gong! Gong!' and that means the &lt;a href=\"kalpa\"&gt;kalpa&lt;/a&gt; has turned.\"\nThe Leaper Demon King knew all this was true but still he said, \"Wait, first and last of spirits, the kalpa-turning is brought too soon and I can prove it! Look over there on top of &lt;a href=\"Red%20Mountain\"&gt;Red Mountain&lt;/a&gt;. See &lt;a href=\"the%20Greedy%20Man\"&gt;the Greedy Man&lt;/a&gt; waving his arms?\"\nAlduin swallowed more of Mereth (this was the destruction of Njorvela and Teed County) and looked over. Indeed the Greedy Man was waving his arms as if to tell the time-eating dragon to stop. Alduin snorted gruffly (a few farms shot out of his nose but he caught them with his tongue and pulled them back into his mouth, for he eats it all) and said, \"And the Greedy Man always waves his arms about around this time as if to stop me just like you. It is almost as if you two work together to delay me. Is that what this is? Is some other low spirit hiding portions of the world while you two do this thing? Is this why the kalpa-feast always takes a little longer than it did the previous time?\"\nAnd then Alduin looked hard into the eyes of both the Greedy Man (far away) and the Leaper Demon King (close up), one of them for each eye of his own, and he knew it was so. These two spirits gulped big, and were caught.\n\"Oh crap,\" the Greedy Man said, \"He knows my bargain with the king of leapers, I'd better hide under my mountain!\" but he thought and said all this too fast and, without thinking, hid under his mountain even though its base had already been eaten and so it wasn't all still there. (This is how the Greedy Man became trapped both in and outside of kalpas.)\n\"Oh crap,\" said the Leaper Demon King, \"You have found us out, World-Eater! Yes, just after the two bells of the All-Maker's Goat sound the Greedy Man and I and our servants hoard bits and bobs of the world so you can't eat it all. And when the world comes back we sort of just stick these portions back on and so that's why it is all bigger and bigger for you to eat each time. But it wasn't my idea! The Greedy Man hates you so much and it was his idea to finally trap you one kalpa when it was all much too big and so you would explode out from your belly and die so that the world would never have to die again!\"\nAlduin (whose stomach was hurting because it was a little too stretched, which had never happened before, and now he knew why) grew furiously angry and boomed out, \"You stupid little f*cker, do you even know what would HAPPEN if that happened, my dying and being unable to eat and the kalpa left to run forever? Why do I even ask, you who are a little low spirit whose only real power is jumping around? It is the Greedy Man I should really be mad at!\"\nAnd the Leaper Demon King saw a possible way out of this mess for himself but he nodded too eagerly, saying \"Yes, yes, yes! Yes!\" and the dragon knew that any mercy he might give to this little demon would not result in any true learning. So he cursed the king of the leapers, calling him &lt;a href=\"Mehrunes%20Dagon\"&gt;Dagon&lt;/a&gt;, saying:\n\"The Greedy Man has already f*cked himself up good, hiding inside something that didn't exist anymore, but you: you I curse right here and right now! I take away your ability to jump and jump and jump and doom you to [the void] where you will not be able to leave except for auspicious days long between one and another and even so only through hard, hard work. And it will be this way, my little corner cutter, until you have destroyed all that in the world which you have stolen from earlier kalpas, which is to say probably never at all!\"\nDagon (no longer a Leaper Demon King) screamed, \"Please no! We have stolen from you so much and crammed it all back on in the craziest of places that it will take forever for me to regain my jumping kind of happiness! Especially if I can only come back to this world through auspicious days long between one and another that also require rituals! I beg you not to do this, O Aka! I beg you one hundred thousand and eight times!\"\nDagon did as he said, begging Alduin Time-Eater to reverse his decision one hundred thousand and eight times, and halfway through this number Dagon shut his eyes tight to really mean it and then three-quarters through this number he began to shout his beggings to really, really, really mean it, but when he was done begging Alduin was not near the mountaintop he stood on.\nIn fact, after many looks east, west, south, and north, and seeing only the churning dragon stop around him, Dagon realied that at some point when he was begging with his eyes closed that Alduin had eaten him, mountaintop and all, and he had not heard the big chomp because he had been begging too loud. And he knew that the last world had been eaten entirely, except for its stolen portions, and that when the new kalpa began to form The Greedy Man (who never stayed trapped for long) would begin sticking these stolen portions back on in the craziest of places, and that he himself could never jump again until all was put back right.\nHe also knew that the name of \"Dagon\" would no longer be that of a kindly leaper demon but one who would destroy and destroy and destroy whenever he could find some small escape [from his home in the &lt;a href=\"Oblivion%20%28Realm%29\"&gt;oblivion&lt;/a&gt;]...\nFight Two, \"How Herkel the Fool Became a Clever Man\".\nThese were the days of &lt;a href=\"Ysgrim\"&gt;Ysgrim&lt;/a&gt;... [whose] breath was weighted with power sounds...\n...[after] many nights, the destruction of &lt;a href=\"Saarthal\"&gt;Sarthaal&lt;/a&gt; finally saw fit to stop in its burning and the snows were happier. [Ysgrim] shook his head, saying to his thanes and war-wives, \"And once it is buried again, who will remember its halls and mighty sights, like the fountain of voices or the tusk-house where &lt;a href=\"Jarl\"&gt;Jarl&lt;/a&gt; the Tongue shot from his mother's womb yelling profanities that only adults should know? Who would stop the snows?\" (For no one can stop the snows.)\nAnd so his Host moved east and north and east again, a long traveling, and passing &lt;a href=\"Old%20Hroldan\"&gt;Hrol'Dan&lt;/a&gt; (the first one) there was an idea that came to Herkel the Shield-Fed. \"Lord, I have thought of an idea that might keep our memory of Sarthaal and its mighty sights alive, and not only in song. Would it suit your purpose, though we can never rebuild it, that if a &lt;a href=\"Nord\"&gt;Nord&lt;/a&gt; could say a small prayer then the gods would reveal the city in its former glory?\"\nNow Herkel [had] never been a Clever Man, so Ysgrim looked at him cockeyed. What Herkel was saying was magic talk but sometimes ideas grow where there has never been soil before. (This is a gift of &lt;a href=\"Kyne\"&gt;Kyne&lt;/a&gt; called [inspiration].)\nFinally, Ysgrim said, \"You may speak, Herkel, and we shall listen.\"\nAnd now all the shield-thanes and war-wives were looking at Herkel, for all of them would indeed like to see lost Sarthaal again and its mighty sights, if only by an illusion brought by prayer. So Herkel began:\n\"Well, Sarthaal was destroyed all right, the elves made sure of that!\" (Here everyone present made the customary curses.) \"And even though I threw up ancient shields from my gut like hurling discs that killed their first rank and Eriksdotter here danced the icicle-curtain dance and killed their second rank and Broga here mountain-farted and killed their third and fourth ranks (that was funny) and Vjevaka here rolled auspicious numbers on rune bones and killed their fifth rank and Haljor here... [at this point Herkel recites a deed for each of the \"six hundred and some odd\" Nordic warriors that were assembled]... and you, my king, even though you killed by yourself the five-thousandth rank with Olendrung, even after all of these things, the elves still kept coming! And, yes, we lost in the end and that losing cost of our dearest of cities and this is how come we are freezing our asses off on this long traveling...\"\nNow at this point, Herkel the Shield-Fed had talked so long that he needed to stop. It was a [great thing] that he had talked so long at all in all the cold, but his belly was on fire [from even just reciting all their deeds], and so he was able to almost complete his thought. But look! The other Nords had frozen to death while he was talking. (This is why it is now polite to interrupt whenever you are cold.)\n\"Oh crap!\" Herkel said, \"I have talked so long I have killed all of my fighting friends and even my king! [They were] bound by oaths to hear me out and now the destruction of Sarthaal is truly complete! Oh, I am a fool to think myself a Clever Man full of magic talk! See what talking too much does?\"\nBut sure enough &lt;a href=\"Mehrunes%20Dagon\"&gt;Dagon&lt;/a&gt; (who had heard his name) showed up and that old Lord of Misrule laughed and said, \"What a grand, grand f**k up you are, Herkel Shield-Fed! See now, you have done what whole endless legions of elves could not, and by that I mean to destroy utterly the Host of Hoary King Ysgrim!\"\nAnd Herkel began to weep and supplicated himself before Lord Dagon, saying, \"O Ruler of the Firestorm and the Howling Winds, O Gigantic Prince of All Things Harmful, O Dagon the Wicked One Who...hey, wait a minute! How are you even here? This is not one of your summoning days!\"\nAnd Dagon laughed again, saying, \"No sh*t, Herkel, but all that bloodletting and fire at Sarthaal was enough for me [to pierce the veil of the oblivion]! All that whispering into elvish ears sure did the trick!\"\nHerkel Shield-Fed now looked at Dagon cockeyed and said, \"Wait, it was you who sent that horde of elves who, though pierced to their five-thousandth rank, would not be stopped?\" to which Dagon responded, \"Of course! Though it was easy, as they hated you anyway, but yes, yes, it was I who stoked the fire in grim dreams and mirrors, which has only now saw fit to stop burning! Oh well, now I'm off to enjoy my stay! Who knows how long I have before &lt;a href=\"Alduin\"&gt;Alduin&lt;/a&gt; notices that I've escaped his trap again?\"\nBut while Dagon had been saying all this, Herkel had broken [the hammer] Olendrung off of frozen Ysgrim's belt. And filled with renewed anger he struck the Lord of Misrule upside the head. Dagon fell over into the snow with a great flumph, unconscious. And Herkel was about to bash the devil's brains out when he thought: \"Wait a minute! Killing the kings of [the void] never really lasts forever and I'm not sure if even Olendrung could do more than knock him out! Oh, Dagon will be so mad when he wakes up and destroy even more now! I must find a way to get out of this mess! What can I, a fool as can be determined by recent events, do now to put two and two together?\"\nHerkel then had an idea and began to drag the frozen bodies of his king and his fighting friends back to the ruins of Sarthaal west and south and west again. He had to carry them in twos for they were stiff as ice and would not bend for easy lifting, so everytime he came back for another pair of them Herkel hefted Olendrung and smacked Dagon back to sleep. Finally, after all of these labors (three hundred and some trips back to Sarthaal), Herkel dragged Dagon to the edge of the ruins. Dagon was still out like a light, so Herkel had time to complete his plan.\nHe prayed to Alduin the dragon of time, who was the greatest enemy of men, for he ate the world everytime he woke up. But Herkel knew that Dagon was a greater enemy to the dragon, so he put that in his prayer, saying, \"Mighty time-eater, I am Herkel the Fool, and I am truly a fool. But I fought bravely at the fall of Sarthaal which lay now at my feet, as does the one responsible for its destruction. I do not ask you to wake up, Alduin, for that would ruin more than Dagon will (and that's a lot now that I keep hitting his head)! And I do not ask you to bring my fighting friends and king back to life, for that is the province of your brother and even I'm not foolish enough to ask all that! And I do not ask you to turn back time, for that is against the laws of all the gods! But I do ask you for a little help, even though...\" (And here he kept praying.)\nAnd Dagon woke up with a hideous headache to look down on Sarthaal and look! It was not destroyed at all! There were its mighty sights, its halls, its fountain of voices, and the tusk-house of Jarl the Tongue! And arrayed before it was the Host of Hoary Ysgrim all lined up for war!\n\"Oh crap!\" Dagon said, shaking his hurt, hurt head, \"I have come too early, for the destruction of Sarthaal has not occured, for I see the army of King Ysgrim waiting for the elves that I am sending. What could I be thinking, to come before the veils are pierced? Even the laws of trickery would not help me if I did that!\"\nSo Dagon vanished back to his prison [in the void]. And, with him, so did the glamour of old Sarthaal vanish, for it had been brought only by a prayer of Herkel the Fool, who stood among the frozen warriors lined up as if for battle. His plan had worked, though it did little to comfort him, and he said goodbye to his fighting friends and his king and as the snow came in to bury Sarthaal forever, Herkel climbed the steps of High Hrothgaar, where he became at last a Clever Man.\nFight Three, \"The Snow Whale and the Dirtbird\".\nThese were the days of Reddotter, who surpassed her father in shield-biting...\n[And it came to pass that] a strange thing happened: &lt;a href=\"Alduin\"&gt;Alduin&lt;/a&gt; the World-Eater, who sleeps between the [kalpas], had a disturbing dream, and he roused slightly, but not enough to bring ruin, and, heavy-lidded, he went back to the [age-wait]. But he yawned just slightly beforeso, which he had never done. And thus was born the Dirt Patch Which Does Not Gather Snow.\nNow this place cannot be found on any map of &lt;a href=\"Skyrim\"&gt;Skyrim&lt;/a&gt;, and not because we &lt;a href=\"Nords\"&gt;Nords&lt;/a&gt; are shoddy in our cartography (we crossed the Cape of Tears, after all, and marked the passages, which even the Devils in the east use still)\u2026for you see, it is a thing that should not be, a small world-destruction that is more hiccup than intent, and so the Dirt Patch moves about, which caused all manner of trouble (and everyone knows that story) until Fjork Beard-to-Toes of &lt;a href=\"Throat%20of%20the%20World\"&gt;Throat Mountain&lt;/a&gt; used a [voice spell] to contain its jumping around mainly to the west.\nAnyway, after many years, and like all things, some animal life decided that they liked to live best of all in a particular place at the expense of all other places, and some chose the Dirt Patch, and these were birds. (Who can tell why birds do anything?) We do not know where they came from, but came they did, and always, always they managed to find the Dirt Patch and make their homes in it, burrowing down deep in its soft earth, where they made their nests\u2026. (This is not normal bird behavior, I know, but who can tell why birds do anything?) [Only] to get up and out and fly again when the Dirt Patch vanished to go find it once more. (This is why when you see a dirtbird flying north you turn south.)\nNow one day one of the Dumbest Things Ever happened: the Dirt Patch ended up in the sky! Right over a mountain range! (No one can remember exactly where, but it happened.) And the dirtbirds made for it anyway, and began to dig their nests down into the hovering earth, only to fall out with consternation before flying up and around the Dirt Patch [to try again]. Pretty soon they found that they just could not build their nests (and one would think that something that makes no sense, like a big stretch of dirt in the sky, would even be recognized as nonsensical by animals that really make no sense, like birds, but there you have it) and they began a\u2019chirping away all as one in a terrible and irritating lament.\nSo of course they attracted the snow whales.\nSnow whales have been in Skyrim since [the return of Man], living at the tops of the highest mountains, singing in magic tones, jumping from peak to cloud and back again, spreading their joy-snow in horn-like triumph from blowholes. We used to hunt them, our best climbers braving the rocks and ice-sheets, carrying rope and hooked spears. They had much meat, these whales, and blubber, and fluids that made paint and rosewater for our women. The earliest hunters had no luck; spouts of joy-snow [from the whales above] would drift down from the clouds and turn the men goofy. They would laugh like happy babes, some getting so tickled that they\u2019d roll back down the mountainside in big flumphs\u2014which only begat more guffaws-- or begin to pat each other on the back or hug in the masculine style to reaffirm their affections and camaraderie; in essence, the joy-snow got in their heads and they just forgot what they were doing. Eventually, Huggert the Wrinkled Unto Unreadable, one of our Clever Men, made sure that the hunters remembered to occasionally hit one another out of the blue, or make lewd jokes of their respective wives or mothers or sons that had not yet shown promise, and steal and hide the shoes of their fellows, and to line the rims of their shields with wasabi so that, when they bit them, that they might ignore all happiness in fits of burning nose and choked throat. All of these measures availed them not, for the potency of the joy of the snow whales remained [unhindered by any attempt at anger], and its powder would inevitably reduce our hunters again to snickering children, who, when they saw themselves so war-laden in this state, made them chortle and jest all the more.\nLesson learned. We left the snow whales alone.\nThe dirtbirds, though, in their present bothersome sorrow, all trilling and chak chak chak, brought a herd of snow whales up and out of the mountain peaks, looking to see what the fuss was about. They were as surprised as anyone to find a plain of earth suspended in the sky, and soil\u2013breasted birds flitting amok in hysterical despair all around it.\n\"Holy crap,\" one said, \"I have never seen something this dumb.\" And thus the snow whales crooned to each another in their way, and some, driven to pity, spat great gales of joy at the dirtbirds to remove their dirge. But just as the Dirt Patch had been misenchanted to gather no snow, so were the fowl that had inherited it similarly immune. The feathered raucous went unabated.\nOne of the snow whales, a young bull that had only recently grown his mottles, jumped from summit to cloud and back again, twirling so that both of his eyes might see this unholy mess of things. And he snorted, and he remarked, \"What we see here, my kin, is no doubt the insalubrious work of the &lt;a href=\"Mehrunes%20Dagon\"&gt;Dagon&lt;/a&gt;.\"\nNow one of the dirtbirds, a young maiden, heard this declaration and took pause from her horrible wailing and flew to the great eye of the bull and said, \"What now is this about the Lord of Tumult and Foul Tempers, who is known far and wide as the mucker-upper of all things in this world, and whose treachery runs even unto the sons and daughters of the Tava?\" (Tava is a heathen god. Of birds, no less.) But the bull whale splashed into the ice-covered precipice of the nearest mountain, ignoring her. However, since ice is harder than snow, the wide fan of his tail stuck out for a second longer than normal, and, unanswered, the dirtbird dived down and grabbed it with her beak. And this is how she followed the snow whale into [the oblivion].\nThe Clever Men say the realms of [the oblivion] are many, though some [limit] this number to sixteen. And there is not one that can count the endless avenues that run from one realm to another, for they change, and often, for they are as capricious in their natures as the demons that run through or rule them. Nevertheless, there is a strand to &lt;a href=\"Coldharbour\"&gt;Coldharbour&lt;/a&gt;, which is the province of &lt;a href=\"Molag%20Bal\"&gt;Molag Bal&lt;/a&gt;, and most icy beasts have touched or traveled it once, if only in nightmare, and it is perhaps by this and the will of the Gods that the snow whale navigated himself through the void that lay beyond the real world, the dirtbird behind him clamping her beak down hard and her shutting her eyes tight to the visions of evil around her.\n[Thus it was that] the young bull made his way to the frozen court of the King of Rape, crushing up through the very fountain of Bal's courtyard, shattering the lewd ice sculptures that crowned it in the coldest of lusts. And before the soldiers could [muster a defense against] the snow whale, a brassy sound regaled through the court and covered it all in a fog of joy, which set them all to laughing, and it was hideous to hear. And by this sound did Molag Bal deign to rise from his throne and enter the courtyard, to confront the audacity of the bull of the northern clouds. \"And just what the **** do you want?\" he asked.\nThe bull eyed the Prince, and gave a bow as the older cows taught him, and started to say, \"Mighty Lion of Evening, Vulgar and Low, Keeper of Coldharbour since the fall of &lt;a href=\"Lyg\"&gt;Lyg&lt;/a&gt;, Destroyer of the Hearts of Men, I have come to--\" but he was interrupted by the chirping and relentless admonishment of his stowaway, who had left his tail and flown directly into the Prince\u2019s face. The dirtbird maiden\u2019s angry diatribe is [too heinous and nasty] to even repeat here, but more or less she said, \u201c\"ne of your **** kin evidently **** our **** Dirt Patch, which is the only **** place where my people can build their **** nests and since it\u2019s floating in the **** sky that\u2019s **** impossible now, see, and so we cannot lay our **** eggs this season because of such an unnatural **** calamity and so we\u2019ve been forced to wail and **** wail, you ****!\"\nTo which the snow whale assented was the truth, adding only, \"Which is, of course, annoying as hell to the rest of us up there.\"\nThe King of Rape took pause. It had been eons since anyone had spoken to him this way, and it had never, ever been a bird of all things. Bal thought for a second, and finally frowned, shrugging. \"Well, first of all, what the **** is a Dirt Patch?\"\nAnd by turns the snow whale and the dirtbird told the story, and its details, and in his magnificence did Molag Bal know that this was indeed the dream-work of Mehrunes Dagon, his brother of razors, the only Prince who dared trouble the sleep of the dragon-eater, Alduin. But while loyalty between the rulers of [the oblivion] is tenuous, Bal saw no profit in upsetting the ways of his brother, and told his visitors so, adding a threat of terrible censure on them if they did not turn back immediately and without further insult. The dirtbird remained unsatisfied and (remember that birds make no sense) began to peck furiously at the Prince\u2019s head, rebuking him and all his kind and the mischief they wrought.\nPerhaps the snow whale misinterpreted this foolishness for bravery, or perhaps he admired that the dirtbird had come unbidden into the realms of the damned, or maybe it was an admixture of the two with a smidgen of the fondness that all flying things share for one another, but the bull knew that, at this point, he loved the foul-mouthed, unclean, imprudent dirtbird with all of his considerable heart. Before the King of Rape could swat her dead, he trumpeted the courtyard again with joy powder, hoping to send Molag Bal into a handicap of bliss so that they both might escape.\n\"Ho ho ho,\" Molag Bal roared, smiling, though none of it with joy. His aspect became so fierce that even the dirtbird maiden stopped pecking at his head, and she flew behind the bulk of the snow whale in sudden fright. The Prince of Coldharbour spoke: \"You silly little snow whale, do you not know that there can be no joy for me? That long ago I gave up such things to the betterment of my rage? And while I recognize love between creatures that are unalike, I have built a bulwark against its joy and--\"\n\"Wait wait wait,\" the dirtbird interrupted. \"What\u2019s all this about love between creatures unalike?\" And if a snow whale could blush, [that is surely what] the bull did now. Even Molag Bal was taken aback, for he was sure in his heart that any maiden that would follow a man into hell did so only by token of love. For her part, the dirtbird left her hiding place and flew back into the demon prince\u2019s face.\n\"Huh?\" he said, blinking. \"You two aren\u2019t an item?\"\n\"I\u2019m a DIRTBIRD, genius,\" she answered, \"And he\u2019s a **** SNOW WHALE, get it? This isn\u2019t above love, it\u2019s about not being able to lay eggs in a floating stretch of earth, and it\u2019s about your brother being a complete **** who needs to make things right. Or else.\"\nTo which the King of Rape merely raised an opulent eyebrow.\nThe snow whale cleared his throat [in earnest]. \"Or else...\" he started, unsure of himself. \"... or else I will gather all of my kin,\" and at this he found his courage, \"All of them, down to the last newborn cow, from all the mountaintops of Skyrim, and the clouds above it, and from every opening of snow there is in that land, and we will leave it. Forever.\"\nWhich was a confusing thing to Molag Bal, a Prince of Misrule, whose hatred was as bellows in his belly, and who had long since kept his delight of any form of joy under lock and key. And even the dirtbird turned from him to look on the bull, and she, too, simply did not get it.\nBal spoke, \"And what would that matter to me?\"\nNow the soldiers of the Prince of Coldharbour had shaken off their fits of laughter, and took up their pikes again, and remembered their stations and their vileness, and they surrounded the fountain that the bull used as his threshold. And the snow whale\u2019s blowhole was empty, leaving him defenseless to their approach, and maybe one could read this in his eyes, for Molag Bal began to smile wickedly, and the dirtbird gulped with fear.\n\"It matters to you,\" the bull said, \"Mighty Lion of Evening, Vulgar and Low, Keeper of Coldharbour since the fall of Lyg, Destroyer of the Hearts of Men... it matters to you because my kin bring joy to the upper world, who have not yet given up such a thing for the betterment of their rage, and who welcome love and happiness and good cheer\u2026 as much as they fear the coming of ruin, or the color of betrayal, or the visitations of demons. These last are the tools of [the oblivion], and your lifeblood, and it is only through joy that the devices of your dubious employ are the more sweeter to you, yet which are nothing if visited upon those who know nothing but despair in the first place. It matters to you, Lord Bal, for how can you destroy the hearts of men when those hearts are already empty?\"\nAnd, with that, the snow whale sank back into the fountain from whence he came, but he left the wide fin of his tail up out of it for a second longer than normal. And the dirtbird took it within her beak.\nWhen they returned to Skyrim, bursting out of the zenith snow, the snow whale and the dirtbird were met with only silence. Their kin were gone, both kinds, and with them, the noise of crooning and the cacophony of bird-lament. But the maiden felt the tug of the Dirt Patch in her senses, and she sensed that it was southward, and low, and she knew that things had been more or less put back right. She let go of the bull\u2019s tail and flew up to his eye. \"It has worked,\" she said, \"Bal has talked sense into his brother, the Dagon. I can feel it in my breast.\"\n\"I suppose so,\" the bull said, \"And I can hear my herd jumping this way through mountaintop and blue.\" And perhaps when she knew that the snow whale would soon be gone, having rejoined his kin, and perhaps because he had shown her a courage that was unalike as hers but as powerful, or maybe it was an admixture of the two with a smidgen of the fondness that all flying things share for one another, but the dirbird knew that, at this point, she loved the noble, unwieldy, ridiculous snow whale with all of her tiny heart.\n\"Where I live the snow cannot gather,\" she said in the lowest of voices. To which the bull nodded, and said, \"And there is, of course, the difference in size.\" And, at that they smiled, and flew away from one another, and were welcomed back by their kin in songs of praise.\nFight Four, \"The Tenpenny Winter...Again\u201d.\nThese were the days of Rebec the Red, she-captain of the longboat Nail-Knock, whose Reaver-Husbands were [long loved] by High King &lt;a href=\"Ysgrim\"&gt;Ysgrim&lt;/a&gt; [Shorebreaker] and all the Sons and Daughters of &lt;a href=\"Kyne\"&gt;Kyne&lt;/a&gt;...[and so great was their renown] that grim-bearded &lt;a href=\"Shor\"&gt;Shor&lt;/a&gt; himself shouted his lamplight back into some of their hearth-fallen after the &lt;a href=\"Night%20of%20Tears\"&gt;Night of Tears&lt;/a&gt; from [his Ten Tusk Chair (?)] in faraway &lt;a href=\"Sovngarde%20%28Location%29\"&gt;Svongarde&lt;/a&gt;.\nAnd these Returned were as ash, [and impaired] against the Winds at times, [so they were] specially armored to vouchsafe their old forms, wearing hang-wigs for beards built by the [War Wives of Clan (unspecified)] for theirs had blown away in the gust of the Tenpenny Winter wrought by the Fool of New Kreath, his Cleverness cut into throat-ribbons for his trespass into climate magic [and whose] neck-remains became a meat-string game for all the children of Rebec the Red\u2026[text lost]\u2026and still yet for the eight Returned, they lived their [Again Chance(?)] as best they could, and made manly unmention of their ash-make, and instead were properly grateful\u2026[for] in those days, [in that kalpa], the skies of the Rim were plagued by dragons, and so many of their countrymen had suffered Burning but [they] were not by their individual glory similarly Returned.\nThree god-guisers came to the ice-lined shoreline of Rebec\u2019s holdings, to see these ashen stalwarts of the &lt;a href=\"Nords\"&gt;Nords&lt;/a&gt;, all dress-fleshed in &lt;a href=\"Greybeard\"&gt;Greybeard&lt;/a&gt; aspect. The first of them was tall and long of limb, whose [flanks] could not fully hide the scale-bright hide of his true celestial station. He was the &lt;a href=\"Aka-Tusk\"&gt;Aka-Tusk&lt;/a&gt;, a somewhat foreign spirit (yeah, right) from the Totem Wars, and known mainly in the tongue of Men as the enemy-brother of Shor, and he said, \u201cLook on them, my friends, and how the North has gone insane with the beating and beating of the Doom Drum, whose father they fool-talk call their All-Maker.\u201d\nThe second was full-bound in furs, [his bulk] so great that he looked more like the shaggy centipedes the &lt;a href=\"Orsimer\"&gt;Orc&lt;/a&gt; Tribes herd than a true Greybeard\u2026[he needed so many furs] because he refused to surrender his second set of war arms even in this preset parley (plus he was just plain cold) and [nor did he undo his horns, despite] the [text lost] advice of his companions\u2026but the fatness and odd-wrought shape of Merry Eyesore the Elk, the Greybeard Deer (what, you thought animals couldn\u2019t join the Men of the Throat?), was his hope for excuse should he be seen by the shield-thanes or warriors of the icy shore holds of Rebec the Red. And the &lt;a href=\"Mehrunes%20Dagon\"&gt;Dagon&lt;/a&gt; said, \u201cWho gives a ****? I\u2019m FREEZING out here, and see no lesson to be learned that really I care about at all. Aka, while my exile in the utter dark is no fun either, pray send me back to [the oblivion] if all you\u2019ve done is bring us here to lament [the Silver (?) Convent]. Yet again.\u201d\nAnd the third, who looked akin to a &lt;a href=\"Frost%20Giant%20%28Dawnguard%29\"&gt;Karstaag-man&lt;/a&gt;, [gigantic], and adorned in storm cloud and endless, endless yellowtooth\u2026 [he] was &lt;a href=\"Alduin\"&gt;Alduin&lt;/a&gt; the World-Eater, and he only said, \"Ho ha ho.\"\n\u201cYou will eat nothing here, aspect Ald,\u201d said the Aka-Tusk, sensing trouble. \u201cDo not forget that it was Heaven itself that shed you from me.\u201d\n\u201cWho cares,\u201d the World-Eater said, \u201cYou speak of the Prolix Laws, which do not bind me if you strain our kinship. You awoke me. That bell-sound has consequence. And the Dagon here, well, he\u2019s going to tell me right now where he\u2019s hidden all the additions to the World he has hoarded in the long aeons of salmon-leap which he calls his own survival.\u201d\n\u201cI am no salmon!\u201d Dagon said. \u201cI\u2019m just smarter than either of you. If that grants me an association with the ineffable ocean, I\u2019ll take any weirding I can, and in red. The ocean, in the end, will avail us no answers we can acceptably parse. Bring it, big man.\u201d\nNow [what] hasn\u2019t been said up until now is that a very bored Nord was listening to all of this, Korl-jkorl the Pity Husband of Rebec, whose clan was destroyed at &lt;a href=\"Saarthal\"&gt;Sarthaal&lt;/a&gt; and, unbrave, he was not one of the Returned but [rather] one of the Running instead. (A tally has always been kept of Those That Ran from the Sack, mind you. Sometimes our memories won\u2019t let things go, even if thinking on the same thing too much risks a frozen thought-set. Anyhow.)\nMost of those that are Pitied accept their station. These are those Nords who, for various sanctioned reasons (Orc rape, unforeseen winter-taking, ashamed-but-acquiescent affiliation with the &lt;a href=\"Borgas\"&gt;Borgas&lt;/a&gt; Clan when &lt;a href=\"Wulfharth\"&gt;Wufharth&lt;/a&gt; Roared most of them straight past the Underworld into [Hell])\u2026these are wed to their new Wives or Husbands in the special traditions of Mara, the Handmaiden of Kyne, whose pity is endless and especial.\nKorl-jkorl had been spared because of [it doesn\u2019t matter], but he had never been comfortable with his taking of the saving-ring from Rebec the Red (though he probably should have been), and so often wandered mooncalf-fashion to the extents of her holdings, thinking his [hope-to-finally-thaw (?) thoughts]. This day, though, and his arbitrariness interrupted, Korl-jkorl watched the three Powers [of the Around Us] bicker, lament, and tummy-rumble their various agendas and he found himself most upset. This was god-talk, and we Nords have always felt nuisance with that. We blame having to live in the here and now for the most part for the most for that.\nSo Korl-jkorl revealed himself, saying, \u201cGet off this hilltop, all three of you; [your intrusions] have only ever caused upset and you full well know it. What authority do you have to observe the lands of Rebec the Red with such potent intent that has yet to be decided among any of you?\u201d And then, like most Nords when they are ready to settle matters, he brandished a weapon, that Nordic gesture which really translates to \u201cI don\u2019t really care your answer to my question.\u201d\nAlduin said, \u201cOh ho, good. A fight. Finally.\u201d\nThe Aka-Tusk straightened, surprised that their guises had been so easily [seen through], and purposely sighed enough to let [dragonfire] out to perhaps frighten the mortal standing before them. But, as has been said, dragons were at flight in the skies in these days, and this type of fear, if even halfheartedly divinely-wrought, didn\u2019t work on Korl-jkorl. \u201cWait,\u201d Aka said, and those around him felt his hold on Time. \u201cWe came merely to look upon your allies in ash, fallen in a place you regard in glory and that the Drummer has seen fit to--\u201d\n\u201cNo, we didn\u2019t,\u201d the Dagon said, shifting in his furs. \u201cWho knows why we came, except at your summons. And if this Northman wants to fight, I agree with Old Ald here: good.\u201d And the Lord of Tumult and Foul Tempers then shed his guise, and held weapons and High King heads in each of his fists.\n\u201cCome then, little Nord, let me beat you dead into the snow with the brainpans of your ancient forebears.\u201d\n_____\nI'll finish this one, I pinky swear. Oh right, the +.\nFight Six, \"The 911th Cow\".\nThese [were the days] of Anna Kuhlsdotter, who once led her cloud-sisters into victorious war against the Skald of Broken Books...\nAnd of the &lt;a href=\"Giant%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Giants&lt;/a&gt; we speak little, even less to strangers, for their history is hidden in long loud power-shouts. At home, it is a pain in the ass to tell their stories and then clean all the things knocked down in the telling... and in a foreign hearth it is [just plain rude]. So we speak of them (for we must-- who does not honor their parents?) under the rim of the sky or, here, written on sheafs of pelt, for such is the mettle of their threat. This is [a song (or dirge, manuscript unclear)], then, of the threat of Giants and, like most, it involves painted cows.\n[First, though] let us put two Powers in place, the &lt;a href=\"Alduin\"&gt;Dragon&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Mehrunes%20Dagon\"&gt;Dagon&lt;/a&gt;, for this is also and foremost a Fight of Theirs Story [so such is proper]... [text lost]... the only one to have occurred on the Demon King's birthday. (No, that inglorious day-month will not be revealed here for it is dangerous and, yes, once, a very long time ago-- ONCE-- we were all tricked into celebrating it in a very big sissy-fuss where we were made to wear special hats.)\nDagon [it can be surmised] found some indefatigable lady-man wizard from the west to love him from [topside(?)] and thus-by work very, very hard in his witch-craft... [the demon lord] making warlock promises and whispering rewards of the unspeakable and mighty... appearing through shade or familiar in guises too small for the Dragon to notice that he was not in his entirety in [the oblivion] where he had been banished beforetimes... and perhaps happy (because birthdays ARE happy) and infectious with it enough to engender great industry, yet profane still in aspect to retain his stature among the eyes of the wicked from whence his followers always come (when they do not come from fools instead).\n[And the warlock-in-love]... [text lost]... made a mad dance of it all as in the manner of the magic arts of the west [and] summoned his infernal master on this very auspicious day through crazed and love-wrought wizardry [that went beyond the mandate] of right summonings... whereupon the Dagon popped out of a blueberry pie.\n\"I didn't think that would work AT ALL!\" he said, that old Lord of Misrule, and he began to praise the baker's craft in such great cackle and length that [the warlock he had taken as paramour] became jealous in the way of wolf-headed women (you know the ones).\n\"Pssh,\" Dagon said, \"I, the Lord of Razors and Red-drink, King of Terrible Intent, Mehrunes the Prince of Four Dooms and One Paradise, I Who Commandeth 88 Legions Daedric... I just came out of a PIE, you swooning harpy! That is totally bat-*** insane!\"\nWhereafter he bit out the neck of the spurned warlock and played in the blood.\nNow the Dragon's role here is more subtle, and existed really only in the fear of a little farm girl in the highlands of &lt;a href=\"Newkreath\"&gt;Newkreath&lt;/a&gt;. For who does not fear Alduin the World Eater, and especially children, who always think they are the last to come for they are the newest to be? (And children, BEING special, perhaps are right and maybe it is only through their fears that [this kalpa] still survives, so we will not question it.)\nAnyhow, her name was Aless (her father was fond of the South, and &lt;a href=\"Cyrodiil\"&gt;Ald Cyrod&lt;/a&gt;, and knew the stories of their famous and ancient &lt;a href=\"Alessia\"&gt;Queen&lt;/a&gt;), and she had such a fear that any day now the Dragon would awake to eat up everything she ever knew that she became determined to do all she could [to protect it]. Naturally, she began to paint many, many cows.\nHere is why: the Giants came from Old &lt;a href=\"Atmora\"&gt;Atmora&lt;/a&gt;, up there across the Northern Ice back in the gone-to-twilight-now age of myth... and settled here in the &lt;a href=\"Skyrim\"&gt;Skyrim&lt;/a&gt;, and all along the mountain ranges of our coasts. (Yes, they are our true ancestors-- do not believe your aunt from the university-- and, yes, we were once as big as them-- as tall as THIS-- but that is another story)... [text lost]... and after [the Great Calamity] happened [the clan-things (peoples? tribes? Text seems to indicate mankind as a whole, though that is )]... we were of a kind disrupted... and we &lt;a href=\"Nords\"&gt;Nords&lt;/a&gt; fell into fighting and drove our Giant-kin up unto the mountaintops [and we were a wicked-folk for many years]... [until all] things had changed forever. Once the Moot resumed [(unspecified) years later] things got back to a new semblance of normalcy and borders were redrawn and agreed with in beer-talk, and raidings of the merethlands took everyone's mind off old feuds, and pretty soon (well, not pretty soon but whatever) the Giants began to come down from the mountains again. And they were a bit different than we Nords remembered, or perhaps we had forgotten much, but they would not speak to us anymore-- they would only smile in their lazy way, stomp over, and take our stuff.\nIf we fought them, they roared louder than the &lt;a href=\"Tongues\"&gt;Tongues&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"High%20Hrothgar\"&gt;High Hrothgar&lt;/a&gt;, and brave steads would be blasted whole into so much paste, [chickens and all (?)]... [and] eventually we learned that if we left stuff out for the Giants, and painted this stuff brightly and with swirls (they love swirls) and stuck big signs up pointing to it all, they would simply take THAT stuff and not anything else and no fighting would be have to be done (not that what I have described was really fighting-- no one fights the Giants is the point). And that explains the Painting The Cows tradition, for as lazily-smiled as they are, so much that they seem that they wouldn't hurt a soul (ha!), the Giants eat meat and lots of it. Aless (remember her still?) thought to herself, \"I am so, so afraid the Dragon will awake and eat the world-- ANY DAY NOW-- that I will paint every cow I see so as to summon all the Giants I can to beat up old Scaly Face, and beat him up really, really hard-- hard enough to knock him out and back to sleep!\" (Aless had heard, as you have now, that \"no one fights the Giants\" and took it a little bit too much to heart.)\nShe began with her stead's herd, some four-dozens strong [with] two bulls (the old one broken off in a separate cattle-gate to stomp out his last days in complaint-- and Aless made her father swear not to kill this old bull for she loved him in the way children love the things others see as useless or spent) ...and yet by the seventh cow Aless had run out of paint. \"I shouldn't have done so many swirls,\" she said, sighing. And that is when he appeared, the Dagon, drawn up in the stolen Nordskin of a Clever Man, come from the west by side-stepping [through the real].\n\"No,\" he said through his impressive bead-knit beard, \"You did well. If I were a giant, these would be mighty fine looking cows to take. But why paint so many? [One a season per stead] is the norm.\"\nAless frowned up at Dagon-turned-Clever, and with no suspicion, for she was a child and they are taught to respect our [magic-men]. \"Because I hate the Dragon,\" she admitted, immediately fearing admonishment. (It is not very wise to talk ill of Alduin at any time, especially in the presence of the Very, Very Wise.) She corrected herself: \"Well, more like I hate the fear of him. I'm sorry for saying the thing before.\"\n\"Hmm,\" Dagon said, \"Your fear is well-founded. The Time Eater comes soon.\"\n\"WHAT I SO KNEW IT\" Aless said, grabbing her paint buckets and brushes [in a scramble], intent on going back to her hearth to get her play-dolls and kid-shields to sell them for more supplies. \"I gotta go, mister, I need to summon the Giants REAL FAST and A BUNCH.\"\n\"Child,\" Dagon laughed, \"You will never paint so many as that, given your little power. But, aye, your plan is a good one. Many Giants, really fast. Yes. That's smart. Now come with me. &lt;a href=\"Kyne\"&gt;Kyne&lt;/a&gt;--\" and at this name of the Sacred, the demon almost choked, \"--she lends me the winds and I can walk us from one to another. And &lt;a href=\"Tsun\"&gt;Tsun&lt;/a&gt;--\" and at this Name Dagon finally did choke, coughing harshly but hiding it as age, \"--he grants my craft-wit with provisions from the aether. You will have all the paint you need, and be swift enough to swirl every cow from here to &lt;a href=\"Windhelm\"&gt;Windhelm&lt;/a&gt;.\"\n\"That is SO cool!\" Aless said, jumping. But by speaking of so many Gods [and the Heavenly Halls in which they live], Dagon had brought a horrible scratch to his throat. He coughed again, and at length, finally doubling over. Aless frowned again, this time with what looked like pity, and put her hand on his back. \"You okay, mister? I believe you about all your magic, but maybe you should just rest. I can sell my play-dolls and get paint and just, like, run fast--\"\n\"I'm fine, dear,\" Dagon said, waving her off, too harshly, and then [realizing he was frightful] found a composure, \"And I am sorry myself for scaring you just then. It is only because I can feel the Age turning, and so am sick with the impending death of the World.\"\n\"Um,\" Aless said. \"You're still being scary.\"\n\"Then paint the rest of these and let us move. You are brave, and worthy, but cannot run so fast as we need. We have cows to swirl and Giants to bring down from the mountains. Through their might only can we make the Dragon retreat back into slumber and thereby save all that we know.\" And soon then did the Dagon and the girl step into a wind [and disappear].\n[Now] it can be guessed that Dagon was a lying sack of ****-- the Dragon wasn't coming at all and would be asleep til...[text lost]...which is far from now. But the Lord of Razors has ever hated the North, for it was here that he was born (after a fashion), and it was here he was cursed, and so on this, his birthday, he had determined that he would destroy all of the Skyrim and all the Nords in it. He indeed needed his little cow-painter to draw down the Giants (or maybe it only amused him to use one of our own, we cannot say), and so he [played her fear] for a fouler purpose: he knew that so many Giants come down from the mountains would cause the High King to think it war, and muster. And any war with the Old Fathers would undo us.\nNow Dagon-as-Clever did as he said, wind'ng Aless from stead to stead, watching over her as she painted the cows at each, summoning [snow-fogs to hide her quickened labors], from Newkreath to Gant and the &lt;a href=\"Uttering%20Hills%20Cave\"&gt;Uttering Hills&lt;/a&gt; of Jarlmung County, filling her buckets [in fast conjurations] and even blessing each cow in Kyne's name alongside her, coughing each time. By the 400th cow, his beard was hack-stuck [with sickness]. By the 650th cow, he would speak no more names wrought by the Gods. And it was by the 700th cow that the Dagon noticed that Aless was painting the swirls [in a different fashion], to which she explained, \"Each county has a different Lookit Me Stamp,\" and frowning at him she asked, \"But you know that, right?\"\n\"Oh, right, right, indeed,\" he said, \"Blame my ailment and our hasty mission. It has left me with a perplextion of the brain. Stamp away!\" to which Aless smiled, \"No problem, I'm getting tired, too. There, seven hundred and fifty-two! How many do you think we'll need?\"\n\"At least nine hundred and ten,\" Dagon said, \"That is a lucky number.\" (This is true.) And then they vanished [into the wind] again, coming out into Windhelm, fortress-lands of the High King. \"We'd better hurry here,\" Dagon advised.\n\"Why?\"\n\"Why what?\"\n\"Why hurry here? You mean more than seven hundred and fifty-two cows in five hours hurry?\"\n\"Um,\" Dagon said, feigning more sickness, \"Because these are the king's cows and we have not the Special Royal Cow Painting Permits, nor the time to explain [the turning of the Age]. The Dragon is coming too soon for parley such as that.\"\nAnd just as she started swirling these new cows (under cover of snow-curtains and in the shadow of the Thaneswall) Aless asked, \"But why doesn't the High King know this already? Doesn't he have &lt;a href=\"Court%20Wizard\"&gt;Clevermen advisors&lt;/a&gt; and Witching Wives to tell him? And the Queen, doesn't she have that six-pair of Scrying Eyestalks of &lt;a href=\"Hermaeus%20Mora\"&gt;Old Man Mora&lt;/a&gt;?\"\n\"Who knows the way of kings and queens, little farm girl,\" Dagon countered, beginning to lose his temper and seeing now this always-questioning Aless as a turkey-leg in his stomach. But no, he thought, I can wait. [I can wait.]\nAless shrugged, painting the cows in what Dagon assumed was [the manner] of Windhelm now, and saying only, \"I guess you're right, mister. But I'm named after a queen, a really pretty one, the books say.\" And [at this] Aless spoke of South Cyrod and its tales of mereth-kill by Men and heroes sent by the Gods, and Dagon's head began to swim with it, wind to wind and herd to herd in the Windhelmlands with the girl always talking and talking, for the demon hated the [lands of the Aleshut-tribes] nearly as much as our own but for different reasons, and just as he was about to let loose his rage (for that was his Base Nature), Aless spoke up, giggling with victory, \"Nine hundred and ten with paint to spare!\"\nAt which point, Dagon thought the deed to be done, and he began to grow fangs behind his beard.\n\"Holy crap!\" Aless said, looking at her paint-covered dress. \"We totally forgot the signs!\"\n\"Huh?\"\n\"In all of this crazy fast painting, mister, we forgot to stick up the Look Over Here signs! The Giants won't know to come! We really screwed this up!\"\nDagon slid his fangs back in, for what she spoke was [true]. He sighed, \"Yes. The signs. Totally forgot them. Crap.\"\n\"Tell you what,\" Aless said, \"Take me back home. We can grab the signs I've made there and you can Tsun-them-up and make more and zip everywhere we've been to everywhere ELSE we've been putting them all up. And meanwhile I'll paint ONE MORE COW to make it nine hundred and ELEVEN. That's gotta be luckier than lucky, right?\"\nDagon-as-Clever now frowned, for he wanted war soon, and said, \"I suppose so. Really, what's one more cow going to hurt?\" And [they stepped back] through the wind to Aless' own stead, whereupon she ran to the sign-sheds and retrieved as many as she could carry, dumping them nearly on Dagon's foot. Oh by the sixteen hells I'm going to eat this dumb girl, he thought, with WASABI! But he picked up the Look Over Heres and multiplied them unto a bigger bundle, shouldering them all.\n\"Night is falling fast, mister, you better hurry!\"\nAnd Dagon faded into the winds, dizzy with his plannings and smirkings and thinkings, stamping sign after sign at each herd of cows from Newkreath to Windhelm and all the places between, wishing himself another warlock-bite for all this trouble, finally growing out his four arms to make the goings-on faster, wind-step to sign-post, dreaming of [a tide] of Giants come down from the peaks of Skyrim to blast the Northmen away for all time, and time it was he lost track of, until he finally arrived back at the stead of Aless the Dragon Hater.\n\"Hi,\" she said, seeing Dagon's true form, \"You totally forgot we painted every cow here at the beginning of all of this, you big dummy. So I painted this old bull instead.\"\nAnd it was true, Aless had taken from its cattle-gate the bull she had begged her father not to kill and to which her father had agreed, and instead of swirls, she had painted [wings on it]. Before the Dagon's eyes this bull [transformed itself as in the manner of god-guiser magic] into &lt;a href=\"Morihaus\"&gt;Mor&lt;/a&gt;, the Bull of the South, Son-of-Kyne, and demiprince of All Winds.\nMor snorted through the hoop of his nose-ring and greeted the [King of Razors]. \"Hello, Dagon. The prayers of children very seldom go unnoticed.\"\nAless said, \"That means me.\"\nMor continued: \"You are trespassing outside your mandated day of summoning, Lord Daedroth. Heaven is not happy of it.\"\nAless smiled and lifted up one finger, \"One, you're NEVER supposed to badmouth Alduin in front of a Clever Man. And YOU didn't berate me.\" She lifted up a second. \"Two, you can't even speak the names of the Gods without choking, and every Clever Man has wind enough in his throat to revere them without censure, involuntary or not.\" Three fingers, now four; five, and six with a second hand. \"Then of course the swirls, which we Nords paint the same no matter whichever clan we belong to, because the Giants speak only ONE language and it's in our best interest to talk straight with them. I could mention several others, but you've guessed them all: the spell you suffered at the mention of my ancient namesake, whose story I peppered with sayings that are supposed to be repeated by any that are near as in the hymnal halls, and the Eyestalks of Say What Huh? that don't even EXIST which you just nodded your fake Clever head to, and--\"\n\"I think, little namesake,\" Mor bellowed, \"That he gets the point.\"\nDagon was fuming now, snow melting around his new-wrought hooves, stretching up and out into demon-skin, red like terror, ebon-armed and frothing. Aless stood her ground. Mor stamped twice, an [approval and a threat].\n\"You would have made my beloved proud with your courage,\" the Bull said to Aless, and to Dagon: \"Stand down, Demon King, and go down. You will not win this day, even though it is crowned with the power of your first coming.\"\n\"WHAT NOW,\" Dagon roared, sending them both back with a [bellows-fire], \"YOU ARE NOTHING TO ME, MORIHAUS HALF-SPIRIT! THE DAGON FIGHTS NOT THE SONS OF HEAVEN'S CONCUBINES BUT HEAVEN'S KING ITSELF.\"\n\"Yeah, sure,\" Aless giggled, \"And how does that work out for you? Every single fight you have with the Dragon ends up with you losing, King Chump. And it will always be like that. Here, there, then, now, or in the future: the Dragon wins over you, as he wins over us all. I'm not afraid of that anymore. More importantly, I'm not afraid of YOU.\"\nDagon stepped forward, crackling now [with flame and old woe]. Mor bent his horns to the ready. Aless stayed where she was.\n\"I wouldn't do that, mister\" she said. \"Those swirls that I started painting as soon as we went a-wind'ng? They weren't Giant-Come-Shiny Swirls but hearth-warnings... that YOU were here. In the language of each clan, on all the cows they're looking at RIGHT NOW since you put all those signs up. That you're here-- right here, right where I asked you to return. I think pretty soon you'll start to hear the horns. And even you can't take on all the Sons and Daughters of Kyne, you *******.\"\nAnd that's when they did hear [the horns of all clans], and the closest was as like a stormsong of thundernachs, for Mor was near, and he [was the issue of the Greater Sky]. And Dagon knew that where the horn soundings landed, the Tongues of High Hrothgar could step, and, when together, the greybeards could breathe unto being the ghost of Shor, which lay all Powers low [even in half-death].\n\"A curse on the house of Alessia,\" Dagon muttered before summoning himself a Gate to [the oblivion], for he knew his works were all undone, \"And eight more on the Men of the Dragon. There will be an hour when--\"\nAless leaned against her bull.\n\"Hey, Coughy,\" she said, \"Shut up and go already. It's way past my bedtime.\"\nAnd he did, missing the arrival of the hosts of Hrothgar and Newkreath, and the runners of nearby [Hjaalmarch], and, of course, the thanes of Aless' own stead, which included her father, all of which saw the farm girl in her messy dress leaning against the [Bull of Heaven], glorified in story and song since the days of our first dawn, and all afit for battle and confused [that it would not be met] and more still overcome with the blessings of the Skyrim by the Gods we hold aloft.\nTo which Aless could only answer: \"It's a really long story, guys.\""}

As every cub knows, &lt;a href=\"Rajhin\"&gt;Rajhin&lt;/a&gt; the Purring Liar, the Trickster &lt;a href=\"God\"&gt;God&lt;/a&gt;, and the Cat Who Walks cares little for stuffy aphorisms. He lives to challenge limits and stretch more than just the truth. To him, one shadow proved too few for his purposes ...\nFor one day, Rajhin found himself walking in the hot sun. He called out to &lt;a href=\"Khenarthi\"&gt;Khenarthi&lt;/a&gt; to blow a breeze through his mane, but the Wind God was otherwise occupied. Rajhin then asked &lt;a href=\"Alkosh\"&gt;Alkosh&lt;/a&gt; to shorten the day and bring cool night. But Alkosh did not steal away the day at the Thief-God's word. None of Rajhin's further appeals brought relief, and so the trickster was left to his own devices.\nIn time, Rajhin came upon a wealthy merchant in the shade of a tall stone. \"My friend,\" Rajhin said, \"kindly share your resting place with this unfortunate one.\"\nBut the merchant growled, \"There is no room, wanderer. The stone's shade is large enough for one, but not two!\"\nRajhin saw the truth in this statement, rude as it was, and did not argue. Instead, he purred, \"Did you drop a bag of gold along the path? For this one passed such a treasure a moment ago.\"\nThe merchant's frown turned to surprise. In a moment, the fat one struggled to his feet. \"Why, I must have! Pray tell me where you saw it and I shall leave my shady stone to you!\"\nRajhin directed the greedy trader down the path whence he had come and the man hurried off. But as he went, the trickster saw the fat merchant's shadow easily dwarfed that of the stone.\n\"Why should I settle for the egg when the hen stands before me?\" Rajhin mused. With a flick of a hidden knife, the thief-god cut the fat merchant's shadow away so cleanly that the greedy man didn't even notice.\nWithin moments, he tied the shadow's feet to his own and it spead out before him, opposite his own shadow. This cooled the Trickster God him from the burning sun.\nLaughing, Rajhin continued down the road, his two shadows dancing before him and behind him."}

They will mention how they are aspects of the Mage, and that there are many more aspects that &lt;a href=\"The%20Serpent%20%28Celestial%29\"&gt;The Serpent&lt;/a&gt; is trying to gather up and bring under his control. After they are done speaking, talk to Valla and she will show you a vision of what happened to the Mage. The Serpent was not strong enough to defeat her one-on-one, so he split her into many pieces that he could devour one by one. Speak with Valla again after this and she will confirm that the Serpent is trying to corrupt each aspect of the Mage and forge the Celestial anew under its control.\nValla will ask for your help in finding the other aspects of the Mage. They can be found using an artifact known as the Seeker's Sight; Valla will give you said artifact, but it is broken. When Valla and &lt;a href=\"Ahlora\"&gt;Ahlora&lt;/a&gt; fell from the sky, three gems were lost. You must find these gems to complete the artifact and start your search for the aspects of the Mage.\nOne of the gems, the Gem of Frost, can be found in the river just southeast of &lt;a href=\"Hircine%27s%20Haunt\"&gt;Hircine's Haunt&lt;/a&gt;. The second gem, the Gem of Thunder, can be found further north, east of the lake, south of the &lt;a href=\"Valley%20of%20Scars%20Wayshrine\"&gt;Valley of Scars Wayshrine&lt;/a&gt;. For the third one, the Gem of Fire, head to the southeast, west of the &lt;a href=\"Lake%20of%20Teeth\"&gt;Lake of Teeth&lt;/a&gt;. Once you have all of them, head to &lt;a href=\"Ogondar%27s%20Winery\"&gt;Ogondar's Winery&lt;/a&gt; just northeast of Belkarth and meet up with Valla and Ahlora. Talk to Ahlora and she will tell you that another of the Mage's aspects has fallen under the Serpent's control. She will also tell you that in order to use the Seeker's Sight to find the other aspects, you must first charge the gems you found with magicka.\nFor this, you must seek out the places in Camlorn where magicka seeps through the cracks and defeat the guardians there. These guardians are world bosses, so do not go in unprepared. One can be found immediately to your northwest, the &lt;a href=\"Adamant%20Anomaly\"&gt;Adamant Anomaly&lt;/a&gt;. You can also go to the &lt;a href=\"Conflagrant%20Anomaly\"&gt;Conflagrant Anomaly&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"Fulminant%20Anomaly\"&gt;Fulminant Anomaly&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"Cyclonic%20Anomaly\"&gt;Cyclonic Anomaly&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Boreal%20Anomaly\"&gt;Boreal Anomaly&lt;/a&gt;. In each of these places, you will find a crystal; attack it and hordes of enemies will appear. These enemies will respawn when killed; your objective is to destroy the crystal itself while surviving their attacks. Once the crystal is gone, an &lt;a href=\"Air%20Atronach\"&gt;Air Atronach&lt;/a&gt; will spawn. You need to kill the atronach to complete this part of the quest. Upon killing it, a &lt;a href=\"Mage%27s%20Echo\"&gt;Mage's Echo&lt;/a&gt; will appear; talking to it is optional.\nOnce you have defeated the atronachs at three of the anomalies, head to the Star-Gazers' Observatory in Belkarth and speak with &lt;a href=\"Hara\"&gt;Hara&lt;/a&gt; there. She now believes that Valla and Ahlora are who they claim to be and is willing to help. She will tell you to place the Seeker's Sight and the three gems in the star-map on the ground here; do that, and floating orbs will appear that the Altmer claim represent the other aspects of the Mage. Speak with Ahlora hereafter; she will tell you that one of the aspects is hiding in a Dwemer ruin, while the other has taken refuge among werewolves. This is referring to two group delves, &lt;a href=\"Rkundzelft\"&gt;Rkundzelft&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Hircine%27s%20Haunt\"&gt;Hircine's Haunt&lt;/a&gt;. Rkundzelft is just east of the &lt;a href=\"Adamant%20Anomaly\"&gt;Adamant Anomaly&lt;/a&gt;, while Hircine's Haunt is northwest of the Adamant Anomaly.\nIn Rkundzelft, the Mage's aspect will be all the way at the end of the dungeon; you will have to fight your way through the boss &lt;a href=\"Mzeklok\"&gt;Mzeklok&lt;/a&gt; to get to her. Use the Seeker's Sight in the room after the big spider, and you will four spirits disappearing one by one and leaving protective barriers behind. Activate the barriers in the order in which the spirits disappeared; the correct order is southeast, northwest, southwest, then northeast. This will cause &lt;a href=\"Mahlia\"&gt;Mahlia&lt;/a&gt; to appear; speak with her and tell her to meet with the other aspects at Ogondar's Winery.\nIn Hircine's Haunt, you should head to the northernmost part of the cave, just after the boss &lt;a href=\"Iron%20Head\"&gt;Iron Head&lt;/a&gt;. Using the Seeker's Sight here will reveal the same kind of puzzle as in Rkundzelft; the correct order this time is east, west, southwest, north, then south. This will cause &lt;a href=\"Faryan\"&gt;Faryan&lt;/a&gt; to appear; tell her to meet with the other aspects at Ogondar's Winery.\nAfter you have found both of the aspects, rendezvous at Ogondar's Winery and speak with Valla. She will tell you the plan to confront the Lost One, the aspect of the Mage that has been corrupted by the Serpent. The four of them are not strong enough to defeat the Lost One, so their best hope is to merge with the lost one and try to fight the corruption from within. For this to work, you need to distract the Lost One through battle.\nHead east to Elinhir; the Lost One is hiding in the sewers here. You will find the sewer entrance in the north of the city. Once you are in the &lt;a href=\"Elinhir%20Sewerworks\"&gt;Elinhir Sewerworks&lt;/a&gt;, look for the Mage's Apex Stone. You will find it by heading in the passageway to the right in the second room, then heading up the stairs in the next room and east into the square room. From there, take the passageway west into the small room, and then proceed south. You will be facing many hordes of enemies along the way, so prepare yourself. Once you reach the room with the water in te middle, all the aspects of the Mage will appear and tell you to go deeper, through the door to your west. \nHead through to the Apex Stone Room; the Lost One will await you in the center. Beware though; this foe is very strong, and she will occasionally summon atronachs to aid her in battle. Once she is defeated, she will try to use the power of the Apex Stone to regain her strength, but the other aspects of the Mage will merge with her at this point, and she will turn to stone. \nAfter this, return to Ogondar's Winery to inform &lt;a href=\"Star-Gazer%20Trilion\"&gt;Star-Gazer Trilion&lt;/a&gt; of what has happened. This will finish the quest."}

So many &lt;a href=\"Khajiit%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Khajiit&lt;/a&gt; fell to this terrible disease, including &lt;a href=\"Z%27har%20Tasluz\"&gt;Z'har Tasluz&lt;/a&gt;, governor of &lt;a href=\"Senchal%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Senchal&lt;/a&gt; and vassal to the royal family of &lt;a href=\"Anequina\"&gt;Anequina&lt;/a&gt;, as well as most of the nobles of the Pellitine bloodline. For seventeen years, Senchal was cut off from the rest of &lt;a href=\"Tamriel\"&gt;Tamriel&lt;/a&gt; and literally left to its own devices. And those devices, they were not altruistic.\nPirates, smugglers, marauders, and thieves rose to positions of power and influence in order to fill the vacuum left by the death of our legitimate leaders. It was a dark time for Senchal and the surrounding countryside, a time of death, destruction, fire, and oppression. We had to become stronger, wilder, to survive, which was ironic considering we always thought of ourselves as the more refined and cultured half of Elsweyr.\nFinally, help arrived in the form of an &lt;a href=\"Imperial%20Legion%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Imperial Legion&lt;/a&gt;. The &lt;a href=\"Thirteenth%20Legion\"&gt;Thirteenth Legion&lt;/a&gt;, to be exact. &lt;a href=\"General%20Renmus\"&gt;General Renmus&lt;/a&gt; and his legionaries were sent by &lt;a href=\"Varen%20Aquilarios%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Emperor Aquilarious&lt;/a&gt; shortly after he took the Ruby Throne. It was a noble gesture, but once the emperor &lt;a href=\"Soulburst\"&gt;disappeared&lt;/a&gt; and the empire collapsed, the general and his soldiers were on their own. But they never abandoned their post. They brought back a semblance of order and made Senchal safer than it had been in years. Until the &lt;a href=\"Dragons%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Dragons&lt;/a&gt; returned.\nGeneral Renmus returned law to our lawless land. He refuses to become a military dictator or oppress our people. Even though we originally met the Imperials with hostility and distrust, we grew to respect them. We even gave them a new name\u2014the &lt;a href=\"Shields%20of%20Senchal\"&gt;Shields of Senchal&lt;/a&gt;, for that is what they quickly became. Under their protection, Senchal began to rebuild and return to something resembling the days of old. Criminal elements were driven back into the shadows and a modicum of law was reestablished. The general even helped us form a governing council to better administrate the needs of the city.\nThey may not be Khajiit, but their hearts are with Senchal and its people. They are our shields, and we appreciate everything they have done and continue to do for us. This one just wishes she believed they can actually save us from the rage of Dragons."}

Please note that this information was obtained at the cost of many lives, and this work should be regarded as the most complete and definitive reference of its kind.\n&lt;a href=\"Baliwog%20%28Shivering%20Isles%29\"&gt;Baliwog&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe Baliwog is an extraordinarily ugly aquatic-dwelling creature that frequents the lakes, rivers and bogs of the Shivering Isles. Although the Baliwog, or \"Wog\" as some of the locals call it, walks on all fours, it should by no means be considered stupid or docile. A fully-grown adult Baliwog can deliver a nasty blow from its claws or a potentially deadly bite from its razor-sharp teeth. The lethality of this beast comes not from the actual damage it can deliver, but from the horrible &lt;a href=\"Diseases%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;diseases&lt;/a&gt; it seems to generate. Also of note is the Baliwog's uncanny ability to regenerate when immersed in water. From our observations, it's best just to avoid these brutes, although it's said some of them carry &lt;a href=\"flawless%20pearl\"&gt;flawless pearl&lt;/a&gt;s in their bodies, though it is not known why they would swallow them, or what use they may serve to the creatures.\n&lt;a href=\"Elytra%20%28Shivering%20Isles%29\"&gt;Elytra&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe Elytra are large insect-like creatures indigenous to much of the Isles. Although there is a marked color difference between the Northern (&lt;a href=\"Mania\"&gt;Mania&lt;/a&gt;) Variety and the Southern (&lt;a href=\"Dementia\"&gt;Dementia&lt;/a&gt;) Variety, they are remarkably similar in behavioral patterns and physical makeup. The Elytra pose a serious threat to the casual traveler, as they have two interesting mechanisms that benefit them in combat. The first is their uncanny ability to block weapon attacks. Through my observations, I have deduced that they utilize their antennae as an early warning system to detect incoming attacks, say from a sword blade or an arrow. The antenna sends a signal to their brains, and they instinctively lift their arms to block. Their second ability is natural venom in their sting. This venom is very deceiving, as it is very low yield, but its real deadly nature comes from its duration. Gone unchecked, the venom can slay the average man over a period of hours. Especially deadly is the &lt;a href=\"Elytra%20Matron\"&gt;Elytra Matron&lt;/a&gt;'s venom, which can last much longer than the &lt;a href=\"Poison%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;poisons&lt;/a&gt; found on the lesser varieties of the creature.\n&lt;a href=\"Flesh%20Atronach%20%28Shivering%20Isles%29\"&gt;Flesh Atronach&lt;/a&gt;.\nOne of the most unusual creatures in the Isles, the Flesh Atronach appears as a sewn-together conglomeration of skin and muscle adorned with mystical symbols and wearing an iron collar. Although it's uncertain whether &lt;a href=\"Sheogorath\"&gt;Sheogorath&lt;/a&gt; or some other &lt;a href=\"Daedric%20Prince\"&gt;Daedric Prince&lt;/a&gt; created this creature, it's obvious that the intent was to use them as guardians. Usually found inhabiting underground ruins, the Flesh Atronach will defend areas it's set to guard until it's destroyed. A unique visual feature of this creature is the energy spots located on its body. These colored areas seem to glow with an inner light and denote the power of the Atronach. In increasing order of magnitude, these seem to be Yellow, Purple, and Red. The function for these spots is still a mystery, but from my observations, I suspect them to be a magic dampening gland of some kind. As expected, the Flesh Atronachs are all completely impervious to disease and poison and highly resistant to &lt;a href=\"Fire%20Damage%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;fire&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Frost%20Damage%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;frost&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href=\"Shock%20Damage%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;Shock&lt;/a&gt; magic seems to affect them adversely, which appears to be their largest weakness. The Purple and Red varieties also seem to possess innate magic abilities, including healing and fireballs.\n&lt;a href=\"Gnarl\"&gt;Gnarl&lt;/a&gt;.\nPerhaps the strangest creature of all is the Gnarl, or \"Walking Tree\" as it's sometimes called. Like the Elytra, this animated plant can be found roaming almost anywhere on the Isles. One of Sheogorath's truly unique creations, the Gnarl has the most unusual trait of being able to use magic cast upon it, and harness that power to bolster its own defense. Once struck with fire, frost or lightning, the Gnarl grows physically larger and becomes resistant to just that element for short time. Interestingly, this is where the Gnarl's vulnerability comes into play. At the same time the Gnarl is resisting that element it was struck with, it becomes vulnerable to all of the other elements. Our guide on the expedition demonstrated this by striking the Gnarl with a flame arrow then a frost arrow and then back to a flame arrow and so on.\n&lt;a href=\"Grummite\"&gt;Grummite&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe Grummite represents the only native weapon-wielding creature in the Shivering Isles. These primitive aquatic-born humanoids are organized in a tribal-like system, though it is uncertain who or what they worship. It would be presumed the Grummite worship Sheogorath, their creator, but their religious totems don't seem to bear the Madgod's likeness. What is known is that they maintain a simple hierarchy, including Shaman and Boss Grummites who seem to command the rest. The Grummite have mastered the art of spellcasting as well, evidenced by the Magus Grummite, which can be quite deadly. Curiously, the Grummite possess a defense mechanism similar to the Baliwog: when immersed in water, the Grummite will begin to regenerate damaged flesh. Unlike the Baliwog, this regeneration extends to rain as well, making them quite formidable on a stormy day. This aquatic healing ability leads me to believe the Baliwog and Grummite are somehow related, but even in my extensive research, I was unable to come up with a solid connection.\n&lt;a href=\"Hunger%20%28Shivering%20Isles%29\"&gt;Hunger&lt;/a&gt;.\nIf any creature represents the darker side of Sheogorath, it's the Hunger. These are pure-born &lt;a href=\"Daedric\"&gt;Daedric&lt;/a&gt; creatures placed here on the Isles as servitors and guards. The Hunger is not to be trifled with; it boasts superior speed and lightning reflexes along with its primary ability of draining its victim's fatigue. My best advice when encountering this horrible creature is to give it a wide berth or slay it quickly. Be wary, as it is said that &lt;a href=\"Conjuration%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;conjuration&lt;/a&gt; magic exists that is able to summon the Hunger and unleash it upon the caster's foes.\n&lt;a href=\"Scalon\"&gt;Scalon&lt;/a&gt;.\nAnother aquatic native of the Shivering Isles is the Scalon. Looking strikingly similar to an upright Baliwog, the Scalon features large &lt;a href=\"Scalon%20Fin\"&gt;fin&lt;/a&gt;-laden appendages and dorsal spines. These creatures are usually quite fearsome, lumbering slowly after its prey. Don't mistake its speed for its weakness, as the Scalon has an incredible leaping attack that allows it to strike at its victims from a surprising distance. Another connection that it shares with the Baliwog is the fact that its bite or claws can transfer disease to its victim. It's recommended that these creatures be dealt with at extreme range with spells or missiles, as the can be quite ferocious in close proximity.\n&lt;a href=\"Shambles\"&gt;Shambles&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe Shambles appears to be some sort of an undead construct made of bone and lashed together with wire or bits of cloth. Oddly, the bones used in their makeup appear to have no correlation to one other. They might have skulls for kneecaps or leg bones for arms, to cite a few examples. The Shambles may be undead, but they pursue any victim as if they were a predator chasing down its prey. Like its undead bony brethren, the Shambles is fully resistant to disease, poison and &lt;a href=\"Paralyze%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;paralysis&lt;/a&gt;; however, they possess a unique resistance to all frost magic. Furthermore, upon death, the Shambles will explode in a spectacular shower of frost. This ability seems to have been added by its creator as an interesting last-ditch defense mechanism. This fact was initially unknown to me, and one of our best guides was lost when his hammer struck the fatal blow. If you intend to combat these undead creatures, be certain to carry frost protection or destroy them at range.\n&lt;a href=\"Skinned%20Hound%20%28Shivering%20Isles%29\"&gt;Skinned Hound&lt;/a&gt;.\nThese nasty undead beasts are generally encountered inside and around the ruins that dot the Isles. The Skinned Hound is extremely fast and agile, and has an insatiable hunger for flesh. Like the Flesh Atronach, it appears to be all skin and muscle that is roughly sewn together, but I am uncertain whether they are summoned or merely constructed. The Skinned Hound is not an adversary to be taken lightly; they feature an incredible invisible charging attack not unlike a ghost, limited frost resistance, and a complete immunity to disease and poison. This beast's weakness is fire. They don't seem intelligent enough to be frightened by it, but it's certainly very efficient at dispatching them quickly.\nAlthough this work only touches upon the combat related aspects of the creatures, I feel this is of primary importance to any traveler within the confines of the Shivering Isles. In future works, I will touch upon the other aspects of these creatures such as reproduction or creation, magical origins, and even some delicious recipes I've discovered in my travels. My best advice when walking the roads and paths of the Isles is to remain ever vigilant and always be prepared. Knowing your foe can mean the difference between a gruesome death and survival."}

This time, Danar has been missing for days, and Moroni fears that something bad has happened.

The Nerevarine can of course also proceed to investigate the missing husband after hearing the rumors, without talking to Moroni.\nBoth the rumors and Moroni direct the Nerevarine towards St. Olms Underworks, where they claim Danar Uvelas uses Skooma with his friends. In the said Underworks, a Corprus Stalker can be encountered. After the Nerevarine has killed it, they will find Danar's Ring on the body, proving that Moroni had be right with her fears that her husband has been infected with &lt;a href=\"Corprus\"&gt;Corprus&lt;/a&gt;.

The entrance to Vanua is found underwater southeast of the Imperial City and south of &lt;a href=\"Memorial%20Cave\"&gt;Memorial Cave&lt;/a&gt; once inside the Hero will find a long narrow hall heading into the ruin's main chamber. The paths through Vanua are lightly guarded by leveled undead.\nWhen reaching the end of the first room, after fighting both &lt;a href=\"Skeleton%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;skeletons&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Lich%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;liches&lt;/a&gt;, look for a button on the left side on the wall to open the wall to the next room. Follow the path fighting the undead until reaching the main chamber.\nThe helm can first be seen in the main chamber on an above ledge, a small shrine has been made around it and can not be reached from the lower level. The body of &lt;a href=\"Sir%20Amiel\"&gt;Sir Amiel&lt;/a&gt; is also found here, with a &lt;a href=\"Fine%20Steel%20Longsword\"&gt;Fine Steel Longsword&lt;/a&gt; and a &lt;a href=\"Knights%20of%20the%20Nine%20Shield\"&gt;Knights of the Nine Shield&lt;/a&gt;.\nInspecting the body will uncover &lt;a href=\"Sir%20Amiel%27s%20Journal\"&gt;Sir Amiel's Journal&lt;/a&gt; and his &lt;a href=\"Sir%20Amiel%27s%20Ring\"&gt;Ring&lt;/a&gt;.

Behind Amiel's body there is a door that leads up to the helm, through some corridors and small rooms. One can see that someone has hacked holes in the walls to be able to proceed further into the ruin.\nAn alternative, if the Hero has high &lt;a href=\"Acrobatics%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;Acrobatics&lt;/a&gt; they can use the broken pillar and jump up to the shrine. Before leaving the ruin, remember to pick up several &lt;a href=\"Welkynd%20Stone%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;Welkynd Stones&lt;/a&gt; located in the small side chambers in the first room.\nEither way, once the helm has been recovered the quest will be completed and the Hero can make their way to the Priory."}

In most cases, merciless bombardment prompted a swift surrender. The Imperials' mastery of digging and siege works combined with the &lt;a href=\"Akavir\"&gt;Akavir&lt;/a&gt;i's fire wizardry and alchemical prowess seemed unstoppable. Even so, some foes fancied themselves the Empire's equals. The false-god of the &lt;a href=\"Dunmer%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Dark Elves&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Vivec%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Vivec&lt;/a&gt; the Liar, was such a foe.\nOver the course of several months, &lt;a href=\"Reman%20II\"&gt;Reman II&lt;/a&gt;'s legions drove the Dark Elves back deep into their own territory. At length, the Elves dug in at the venerable fortress of &lt;a href=\"Ald%20Marak\"&gt;Ald Marak&lt;/a&gt;. It was an imposing fortress to be sure, with high, sturdy walls, and deep-water approaches that made assaults on foot nearly impossible.\nThe sons and daughters of the &lt;a href=\"Tribunal%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Tribunal&lt;/a&gt; faith consolidated their forces behind those walls, content to wait for their god's arrival. But Vivec did not arrive. On the advice of a foolish spy, he took a defensive position elsewhere, in the shadow of &lt;a href=\"Ald%20Iuval\"&gt;Ald Iuval&lt;/a&gt;. Too far away to intervene when the dark hour came.\nThe Imperials knew well the power of faith and fanaticism. Engaging the armies of Morrowind with their god at their back was a fool's gambit. Rather than settle in for a protracted siege, the Imperials concocted a bold plan. Under cover of nightfall, their mystics weaved great spells of water-breathing. Thus ensorcelled, the heavily armored legion marched into &lt;a href=\"Lake%20Coronati\"&gt;Lake Coronati&lt;/a&gt;. At length, they emerged from the water like vengeful ghosts, thundered through the lightly guarded gates, and burned the fort like a bundle of dry kindling.\nSo you see, creativity and daring can win a siege as surely as any ram or trebuchet. Develop a fox's cunning, soldier. It will serve you well."}

There are two main weaknesses: the gates and the captive mammoths. She will task the Vestige with opening the gates, freeing the mammoths and then using the horn to call the giants and strike fear into the enemies' hearts. She then directs you to find her giant friend to help you. \nThe giant will be at the other side of the campfire. Poke him gently and he will kick you and send you flying to a place from where you can invade the fort. From here, head south and you should find yourself in the fort. Now, you have multiple objectives you can do in any order. To your south will be the south gate, which you must open using the levers in the towers on both sides of it. In the north, there is the north gate, where you must follow the same procedure. The mammoths you must free will be strewn about the fort, with the first one right ahead from where you entered. The second, third and fourth mammoth can be found along the south wall. Make sure to pick up the copy of &lt;a href=\"The%20Order%20of%20the%20Ancestor%20Moth\"&gt;The Order of the Ancestor Moth&lt;/a&gt;, by a rock just south of the north gate. \nOnce you have opened the gates and freed the mammoths, head to the Cradlecrush Arena. Upon reaching the arena, Aspera Giant-Friend will appear in front of you. Speak with her, and she will tell you that the leader of the Orcs, &lt;a href=\"Lob%20the%20Cleaver\"&gt;Lob the Cleaver&lt;/a&gt;, is in there, and that sounding the horn will be both an invitation to the giants and a threat to the Orcs. \nHead into the arena and sound the horn. The Orcs will come at you in waves. First you will have to fight two Orcish warriors, then three, and then Lob himself. Once he is defeated, head outside and speak with Aspera. She will thank you for defeating the orcs, give you your reward and then disappear into thin air."}

I'm to speak with Motierre, and find out what he wants.\"\nWalkthrough.\nThis quest begins once the &lt;a href=\"Dark%20Brotherhood%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Dark Brotherhood&lt;/a&gt; quest \"&lt;a href=\"Whispers%20in%20the%20Dark\"&gt;Whispers in the Dark&lt;/a&gt;\" and the two side contracts have all been completed (although it may be offered if only one of the two offered side contracts has been completed), and after speaking with Astrid.\nThe next time the Dragonborn visits the &lt;a href=\"Dark%20Brotherhood%20Sanctuary%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Dark Brotherhood Sanctuary&lt;/a&gt;, Astrid stops them to talk. Although she is unsure what is happening with the voices inside the Dragonborn's head, she feels it would be beneficial to complete the liaison with the contact the Night Mother mentioned. She tells the Dragonborn to go to Volunruud, a crypt to the northeast. Afterward, &lt;a href=\"Nazir\"&gt;Nazir&lt;/a&gt; should be spoken with to conclude the side contracts before pursuing this quest. Note that he has no additional contracts to offer at this time. It is possible to talk to the Brotherhood members about this quest before leaving the Sanctuary.\nThe quest continues at a stone cairn with the entrance northwest of a set of three Nordic stone columns. Down the steps inside the cairn is the entrance to Volunruud proper. Although there are many rooms and tunnels throughout this complex, this quest only requires reaching the bottom of the first set of stairs, turning left, and walking southwest to a small antechamber with &lt;a href=\"Draugr%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;draugr&lt;/a&gt; corpses among the ferns. Note that there may be several high-level &lt;a href=\"Draugr%20Deathlord%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;draugr deathlords&lt;/a&gt;, with ebony weapons on their bodies.\nThrough the wooden door, in the room beyond is Amaund Motierre and his bodyguard, &lt;a href=\"Rexus%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Rexus&lt;/a&gt;. Motierre\u2019s revelations are astonishing; he wishes to hire the Dark Brotherhood to remove several people, culminating with an assassination of the &lt;a href=\"Emperor\"&gt;Emperor&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"Tamriel\"&gt;Tamriel&lt;/a&gt;. He ends his diatribe by motioning to Rexus, who hands the Dragonborn &lt;a href=\"Amaund%20Motierre%27s%20Sealed%20Letter\"&gt;a sealed letter&lt;/a&gt; and a &lt;a href=\"Jeweled%20Amulet%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;jeweled amulet&lt;/a&gt;. Motierre explains the Amulet can be used for purchasing necessities for the forthcoming contracts, and the Sealed Letter is an agreement with the Dark Brotherhood; both are for Astrid. Both characters are essential to the game; if the Dragonborn is fighting for the &lt;a href=\"Empire\"&gt;Septim Empire&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;a href=\"Civil%20War\"&gt;Civil War&lt;/a&gt;, it is impossible to kill both Amaund and Rexus.\nAfter finishing in Volunruud, the quest continues by returning to Astrid. She is understandably incredulous, but showing her the items causes her to begin to believe. \"Surely the Night Mother wouldn't misdirect the Brotherhood...\" For the moment, Astrid will take the letter. In the meantime, the journey continues in &lt;a href=\"Riften%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Riften&lt;/a&gt; with a fence friend of the Brotherhood called &lt;a href=\"Delvin%20Mallory%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Delvin Mallory&lt;/a&gt;, who should be able to appraise the Amulet. He is a trusted ally and is holed up in the underbelly of the town, &lt;a href=\"The%20Ratway\"&gt;The Ratway&lt;/a&gt;.\nOn the fence.\nThe quest now continues in Riften's\u00a0Ratway. If the Dragonborn is a member of the &lt;a href=\"Thieves%20Guild%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Thieves Guild&lt;/a&gt;, then the &lt;a href=\"The%20Ragged%20Flagon%20-%20Cistern\"&gt;Ragged Flagon - Cistern&lt;/a&gt; entrance can be used. Otherwise, the Ratway entrance is by the water\u2019s edge underneath &lt;a href=\"The%20Scorched%20Hammer\"&gt;The Scorched Hammer&lt;/a&gt;. Proceeding through the maze of sewer tunnels will eventually lead to the door into the &lt;a href=\"The%20Ragged%20Flagon\"&gt;Ragged Flagon&lt;/a&gt;, home of the Thieves Guild. Delvin Mallory is here. He should be told that the Dark Brotherhood requires his services. He asks how Astrid is, and will take the jeweled amulet during the conversation.\nMallory inspects the Amulet and identifies it as belonging to the Emperor\u2019s &lt;a href=\"Elder%20Council\"&gt;Elder Council&lt;/a&gt;. Although worried about who the Brotherhood had to murder to obtain it, when asked to purchase it, he eagerly hands over a &lt;a href=\"Letter%20of%20Credit%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;letter of credit&lt;/a&gt; to cover any expenses Astrid requires.\nConclusion.\nBack in the Sanctuary, once the letter of credit from\u00a0Delvin Mallory\u00a0is revealed, the only reward from Astrid is the beginnings of Amaund Motierre\u2019s most devious of plans, which are now being put into action. She hopes the Dragonborn has something fancy to wear when she says, \"you\u2019re going to a wedding...\"\nIf the seal on Amaund Motierre's letter was broken (by reading it) before giving it to her, Astrid will chide the Dragonborn for sloppiness. The next quest will start with \"As I'm sure you already know from reading the letter...\". The Dark Brotherhood quest \"&lt;a href=\"Bound%20Until%20Death\"&gt;Bound Until Death&lt;/a&gt;\" begins immediately and more side contracts are now available from Nazir."}

To celebrate my new status, Skjor and Aela have invited me to attack a Silver Hand camp nearby.\"\nWalkthrough.\nTo start this quest, the Dragonborn must either speak to a &lt;a href=\"The%20Companions\"&gt;Companion&lt;/a&gt;, or go to &lt;a href=\"Farkas\"&gt;Farkas&lt;/a&gt;, and ask him for a job. He will then direct them to see &lt;a href=\"Skjor\"&gt;Skjor&lt;/a&gt;. Skjor will insist they meet him at &lt;a href=\"the%20Underforge\"&gt;the Underforge&lt;/a&gt; at night. There is a rather clear outline along the rock wall that indicates where the secret entrance is. They then must head inside the Underforge, and when ready tell Skjor to begin the ritual. After the ritual, the Dragonborn has moved out into &lt;a href=\"Whiterun%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Whiterun&lt;/a&gt;, and everyone is alerted. They must wait for the effects to wear off or wait until their health bar is depleted, upon which they will lose consciousness. Also, if you choose, you can slay any number of NPCs and feed on them.\u00a0You will acquire no bounty for anyone murdered during this first transformation. (There may be a difference from this description in the PC version, or an update has changed this; upon transformation,\u00a0the Dragonborn is\u00a0still in the Underforge and can exit to the city proper, or use the one-way exit to the countryside to the east of Whiterun.) Map, inventory, and most other actions are not available while in &lt;a href=\"Werewolf%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;werewolf&lt;/a&gt; form, but the experience will persist, so map points discovered and foes killed will be there after reverting to normal form.) Upon regaining consciousness,\u00a0the Dragonborn will have already reverted to human form, although they can transform into a werewolf by selecting \"Beast Form\" under Powers in the Magic menu (keep in mind that there is a 24-hour cooldown period without the Ring of Hircine).\n&lt;a href=\"Aela%20the%20Huntress%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Aela&lt;/a&gt; mentions a &lt;a href=\"Silver%20Hand\"&gt;Silver Hand&lt;/a&gt; camp nearby that must be exterminated. There is no specific way this \"dungeon clearing\" must be accomplished. Aela will be your &lt;a href=\"Followers%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;follower&lt;/a&gt; during this part of the quest.\nA straightforward approach is to head into the stone bunker at &lt;a href=\"Gallows%20Rock\"&gt;Gallows Rock&lt;/a&gt;, pull the chain to lower the gate, and proceed through the passages and rooms to the leader, &lt;a href=\"Krev%20the%20Skinner\"&gt;Krev the Skinner&lt;/a&gt;. Note that there is a door that cannot be opened because it is barred from the other side - the Dragonborn must proceed through the rest of the dungeon bearing to the right. In the fight, Krev is accompanied by three archers; taking them out first will allow attacks to be focused on Krev to dispatch them. At lower levels, Krev will also be susceptible to the fear-inducing roar while in werewolf form, which will make the fight much easier. Aela will also find that Krev and the Silver Hand members have killed Skjor and vows revenge.\nSpeak to Aela afterward to finish the quest.\nFollowers.\nIf the Dragonborn has a follower, the follower will not be present when the former regains consciousness after being a werewolf for the first time. This is because Aela automatically becomes their follower from this time until the end of the quest. The Dragonborn's original follower will return to the place where they live. (Also, telling the follower to wait in a place before the Dragonborn starts the quest will not prevent them from returning to the place where they live after waiting for 3 days.)"}

Never one to ignore suffering, the Silver Werewolf threw her line of rabbits across her shoulder and lumbered toward the sound. Eventually she found a massive, bearded &lt;a href=\"Giant%20%28Online%29\"&gt;giant&lt;/a&gt; all alone at a snuffed out campfire, roaring sadness at the sky.\n\"Why do you cry?\" the Silver Werewolf snarled, and the giant understood thanks to the Medallion of Gulibeg the Quick Fox that she wore around her neck.\n\"My mate gone. My child gone. Vanished, as I slept. There are many tiny tracks. I fear &lt;a href=\"Goblin%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Goblins&lt;/a&gt; have taken them.\"\nHe was not wrong. The Silver Werewolf's keen nose detected the stench of at least a dozen Goblins, as well as the lingering scent of paralytic poison. The giant's family was not dead, but they soon would be, slaughtered to feed the hungry Goblin tribe. No one deserved that cruel fate.\nThe Silver Werewolf straightened and growled deep, a promise. \"The Goblins will not keep them.\"\n\"Bring them home and you may ask anything of me.\"\n\"I will ask you to smile,\" was her only reply.\nNose to the ground, the Silver Werewolf tracked the Goblin stench down Mount Trolhetta, across the Smokefrost Peaks, to a massive Goblin encampment on the fringes of Lost Prospect. It held far more Goblins than she had ever seen in one place, which was why they had been brave enough to kidnap giants for food. A small tribe would never have dared anger the vengeful giants.\nEven for the Silver Werewolf, who could tear apart a dozen Goblins without ruffling her fur, a camp of hundreds was too dangerous. She would have to be clever. Scenting a nearby corpse, an idea dawned on her. She shifted into her &lt;a href=\"Nords%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Nord&lt;/a&gt; form and cloaked herself in the dead woman's rags. Thus clothed and looking entirely harmless, she wandered into the Goblins' camp like a helpless Nord lost in the snow.\nThe Goblins came for her at once, but all they saw was an unarmed Nord woman dressed in rags. A fine prize. Rather than attacking, they eagerly trussed up the Silver Werewolf and took her to their food pens, where they kept all those caught until it came time to cook them for supper. Once there, they threw the Silver Werewolf into a makeshift wooden cage and left her to freeze to death in the cold.\nAs she'd hoped, the overconfident Goblins had played right into her hands. Even muffled by her Nord form, the Silver Werewolf's nose detected the smell of giants nearby. Now, all she had to do was wait until dark, and make her escape with the giant's family and any others who wished freedom.\nDark fell and the Goblins grew sleepy, leaving only their trained &lt;a href=\"Durzog%20%28Online%29\"&gt;durzogs&lt;/a&gt; to prowl the edges of the food paddocks. It was a bad night for hunting, but a good night for sneaking, as clouds crept in to obscure the moon. The Silver Werewolf shifted forms in the dark and quietly snapped the bars of her wooden cage. While those bars would cage a Nord, they were no match for her bestial strength.\nSilent as a shadow, the Silver Werewolf prowled the food paddocks until her keen nose detected one with giants inside. Just as quietly she opened it, crept inside, and slashed the bonds holding down the giantess and her little one.\n\"Your loved one waits where you left him,\" she whispered in a low growl.\n\"Thank you, Moon-kissed. We will see him again, or die trying.\"\nOn her way out, the Silver Werewolf spotted another paddock filled with Nords, moaning with piteous cries. Despite her distaste for these wolf-killers, animals who killed for sport and not for food, she knew they could be useful in their own way.\n\"Run now!\" She snarled to the giantess as she tore into the Nord paddock, snarling and drooling as she menaced them with her claws.\nScreaming Nords burst from their cage in all directions, alerting durzog and Goblin alike. In the commotion, the Silver Werewolf found the giantess and led her toward the camp's edge. Goblins challenged them, but were cut down by the Silver Werewolf's claws and teeth or smashed by the dozens at the hands of the vengeful giantess.\nSoon only the durzogs pursued them, but one deafening howl from the Silver Werewolf sent the cowed dogs skittering back to their masters. A number of Nords had escaped as well, the Silver Werewolf saw, and she had no doubt they would return in force to smash the Goblins soon. That is what Nords did, and this time only, the Silver Werewolf wished them luck.\nUnder cover of darkness, the Silver Werewolf led the giantess back up Mount Trolhetta and there, at the campfire, the family was reunited. The lonely giant clutched his child and mate as he babbled his thanks in his guttural tongue. \"How? How can I repay you?\"\nThinking of her own pups, she repeated:\n\"I will ask you to smile, so I can see how you treasure them above all else.\"\nAnd he did."}

There a unique friendly draugr introduces themselves to the Hero. The draugr lord, recounts his story. He once was a &lt;a href=\"Skaal\"&gt;Skaal&lt;/a&gt;. He goes on to explains that a long time ago, a powerful group of Frost Atronachs were plotting to take over &lt;a href=\"Solstheim%20%28Bloodmoon%29\"&gt;Solstheim&lt;/a&gt;. He then used his knowledge of the \"Black Arts\" to imprison them in these caves. Although he knew that some day he would die, and the Daedra would be freed, so he used his knowledge of &lt;a href=\"Necromancy\"&gt;Necromancy&lt;/a&gt; to make himself immortal, and became an undead. Aesliip then asks the Nerevarine to help him defeat all the frost Atronachs.\nThe Nerevarine is confronted to a choice they must make: Helping Aesliip; or honorably follow what Korst requested: defeat Aesliip. If he is defeated, &lt;a href=\"Aesliip%27s%20Ring\"&gt;his ring&lt;/a&gt; can be taken from his corpse.\nDefeating the dire frost atronachs.\nIf the Nerevarine accepts to help Aesliip, the &lt;a href=\"magical\"&gt;magical&lt;/a&gt; barrier will disappear, and the entrance to Aesliip's Lair, Caverns is revealled. Inside many &lt;a href=\"Dire%20Frost%20Atronach\"&gt;Dire Frost Atronach&lt;/a&gt;s are roaming the frozen tunnels, they often use &lt;a href=\"Destruction%20%28Morrowind%29\"&gt;destruction spells&lt;/a&gt; and they protect themselves with &lt;a href=\"Reflect%20%28Morrowind%29\"&gt;reflect&lt;/a&gt;, which will make the confrontations relatively difficult at lower levels.

Tharsten asks the Nerevarine to investigate the matter.\nThe villager's opinions.\nThe Nerevarine may question people about Engar Ice-Mane, they will all mention what an honorable warrior he is.\nSpeaking to Rigmor, who is in the center of the village, with other &lt;a href=\"Skaal%20Honor%20Guard\"&gt;Skaal Honor Guard&lt;/a&gt;s, will only confirm what Tharsten already knows.

After inspecting their hut, the Hero finds a &lt;a href=\"Letter%20from%20Rigmor%20to%20Risi\"&gt;letter&lt;/a&gt; on the bed. The letter reveals that Rigmor is enamored with Risi, and is warning her, asking her to leave Engar. The Nerevarine may confront her, and she will admit that she had an affair with Rigmor, a while ago, but she ended the relationship. She suggest speaking with Rigmor.\nRigmor's fate.\nOnce Rigmor is confronted he admits fabricating the whole story, and will follow the Hero as they return to report the affair to Tharsten. Tharsten will put the fate of Rigmor in the Nerevarine's hands. They must choose, as according to the Skaal traditions, whether Rigmor is bannished from the Skaal or should he be fed to the Skaal's ceremonial &lt;a href=\"Wolf%20%28Bloodmoon%29\"&gt;wolves&lt;/a&gt;. According to the Skaal code of honor, Tharsten explains that, if the ceremonial wolves are chosen, this would cleanse Rigmor's honor. Once a choice is made, the quest is completed.\nIf the wolves are chosen, Rigmor will run into the pen, by the center of the village, where three wolves have been conjured, Rigmor will perish very fast, and the wolves disappear."}

The Mother of All &lt;a href=\"Khajiit%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Khajiit&lt;/a&gt;. Queen of the Night Sky, the Realms of Twilight, and the Dusk and Dawn. The Favored Daughter of &lt;a href=\"Fadomai\"&gt;Fadomai&lt;/a&gt;. Her spheres are many, for she carries the burdens of our ancestors. All tribes know Azurah as the God of Magic, Beauty, and Prophecy. She is also the keeper of all gates and keys, all rims and thresholds. Khajiit know it was Azurah that lifted us up and bound us to the &lt;a href=\"Lunar%20Lattice\"&gt;Lunar Lattice&lt;/a&gt;, and thus broke us from the chains of fate so that we alone shape our own future. Hers is the gift of &lt;a href=\"ja-Kha%27jay\"&gt;ja-Kha'jay&lt;/a&gt; and all our &lt;a href=\"Furstock\"&gt;perfect forms&lt;/a&gt;. It is written that she knows the names of all the Khajiit that will ever live. You must come to know her yourself, for that is the first step on the Path.\n&lt;a href=\"Khenarthi\"&gt;Khenarthi&lt;/a&gt;. Elder Spirit of the Heavens, who sings her songs with the wind and rain when she passes close to &lt;a href=\"Nirni\"&gt;Nirni&lt;/a&gt;. The most ancient sounds were gifted to the world by this spirit, and we honor her with music, song, and the speaking of myths. For some tribes she also serves as a spirit of mourning, as it is written that when &lt;a href=\"Lorkhaj\"&gt;Lorkhaj&lt;/a&gt; died she hid herself in a storm and wept until &lt;a href=\"Alkosh\"&gt;Alkosh&lt;/a&gt; came to comfort her. Khenarthi carries the &lt;a href=\"souls\"&gt;souls&lt;/a&gt; of dead Khajiit to Azurah for judgment, and is also her messenger. At the end of time, it is her clarion call that will summon the eternal united spirit of all Khajiit to defend creation.\n&lt;a href=\"Jone\"&gt;Jone&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Jode\"&gt;Jode&lt;/a&gt;. The Ever-Mourned. The spirits of the stillborn twins of Fadomai, who still dance in the Lunar Lattice. Khenarthi held them when they were born, and did not have the heart to tell her dying mother the truth. She lit two lanterns to make their eyes bright and rocked them in the sky until her mother passed. Azurah cares for them now and lights the lanterns again when they burn low. The love of Jone and Jode spreads to all Khajiit as moonlight and &lt;a href=\"Moon%20Sugar\"&gt;sugar&lt;/a&gt;. To give your praise to these spirits, you must sing Khenarthi's lullaby on nights of Bright Moons.\n&lt;a href=\"Lorkhaj\"&gt;Lorkhaj&lt;/a&gt;. The Moon Prince. Fadomai's Favored Son. The White Lion. He was born in the &lt;a href=\"Great%20Darkness\"&gt;Great Darkness&lt;/a&gt; and it followed him as his burden. Loved by many, he was considered a noble leader. Lorkhaj was the first spirit to make his own path with purpose, because he was in conflict with himself as soon as he was born. His courage inspired all those he encountered, so much that he united the spirits to make &lt;a href=\"Nirn\"&gt;the World&lt;/a&gt;. He gave his life to do this. We honor his sacrifice by walking the Path with purpose and resisting the call of the Dark. Lorkhaj represents the duality of the Khajiiti soul and the hardships that all Khajiit must overcome. In her wisdom, Azurah lit her brother's pyre with the Twin Lanterns of Jone and Jode, and thus the true spirit of Lorkhaj will sometimes appear\u2014but only when called by Azurah or Khenarthi, or by his oldest name.\n&lt;a href=\"Magrus\"&gt;Magrus&lt;/a&gt;. The &lt;a href=\"Sun\"&gt;Sun&lt;/a&gt; God. Commonly known as the Cat's Eye or the Third Eye of Azurah, He serves as a daily reminder of her wrath. It is written that when Magrus fled from &lt;a href=\"Boethra\"&gt;Boethra&lt;/a&gt; and Lorkhaj, he could only see out of one eye and fell into the &lt;a href=\"Moonshadow%20%28Location%29\"&gt;Moonshadow&lt;/a&gt;. There Azurah judged him as too full of fear to rule a sphere, and she tore out his other eye. Magrus left to the &lt;a href=\"Aetherius\"&gt;heavens&lt;/a&gt; blinded, but Azurah made of his eye a stone to reflect the &lt;a href=\"Varliance%20Gate\"&gt;Varliance Gate&lt;/a&gt;. This is the &lt;a href=\"Aether%20Prism\"&gt;Aether Prism&lt;/a&gt;, which opens at Dawn and closes at Dusk. Some sorcerers hold that Magrus left the eye willingly as an offering to Azurah and her children, and these magi still utter prayers to his name."}

But you can't use them up too soon, or you'll lose your toil quota. And if you miss either quota...\nWell, you've seen the scathe-rings.\nSo that's about it, kynworms: toil and torment, and maintaining the balance between the two. Some of you will fail, and suffer slow and agonizing discorporation - but others will find their inner abominance and triumph, exceeding quota and earning time in the bliss-cells. It's up to you, kynworms: cut it or scathe."}

It was not, as less astute scholars postulate, due to the will of the &lt;a href=\"Aedra\"&gt;Aedra&lt;/a&gt; or some absurd mystical agent, but was a result of their degenerate &lt;a href=\"Daedra\"&gt;Daedra&lt;/a&gt; worship and gross underestimation of their slaves. The human leaders who challenged the Ayleids, Saint &lt;a href=\"Alessia\"&gt;Alessia&lt;/a&gt; in particular, recognized the cultural rot weakening their captors and took advantage of it to orchestrate one of the greatest triumphs of Men.\nThe debauched Elves were apparently quite creative when it came to devising new horrors to inflict on their slaves. What a shock that practices such as \u201cflesh-sculpture\" would drive the tormented men and women of &lt;a href=\"Cyrodiil%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Cyrodiil&lt;/a&gt; to rebellion. In their smug complacency, the Elves could not conceive of the possibility of an uprising\u2014which was well for the slaves, who would have been summarily crushed by the Ayleids at the height of their power.\nAs evidenced by the ruins found throughout &lt;a href=\"Tamriel\"&gt;Tamriel&lt;/a&gt;, the Ayleids were an incredible force. The source of their prodigious might, however, was also the catalyst of their decline. Deals with &lt;a href=\"Daedric%20Princes\"&gt;Daedric Princes&lt;/a&gt; granted them the power they sought. They thought themselves in control\u2014typical &lt;a href=\"Mer\"&gt;Elven&lt;/a&gt; arrogance\u2014as poison crept into their society. The various Daedric cults began bickering and backstabbing, as is their wont, forming the cracks the rebellion would exploit.\nAnother critical factor in the dissolution of Ayleid rule was the indomitable will of the oppressed. We have all read accounts of heroic deeds executed by the likes of Alessia, &lt;a href=\"Morihaus\"&gt;Morihaus&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Pelinal%20Whitestrake\"&gt;Pelinal Whitestrake&lt;/a&gt;. While it's obvious to anyone with a modicum of intellect that these tales are a bit hyperbolic, it is quite clear that exceptional individuals made the establishment of the First Empire possible.\nAlessia's Slave Army was populated with many examples of the true potential of Man. It is a pity that more texts have not survived, for the few we retain give us little insight, and dishonest scholars often distort them for slanderous political purposes. My own ancestor, \u201c&lt;a href=\"Tharanus%20Ye%20Redde-Hand\"&gt;Tharanus Ye Redde-Hand&lt;/a&gt;,\" has been painted as either a slave-overseer or even implied to be &lt;a href=\"Tharhan\"&gt;Tharhan&lt;/a&gt;, the Mutilant of the Gradual Massacre, based on ridiculous interpretations of obscure and questionable footnotes. The jealousy of lesser men, while I do so savor it, can be such an annoyance at times.\nIn reality, based on the rare texts I have had the privilege of consulting in the vaults of &lt;a href=\"White-Gold%20Tower%20%28Online%29\"&gt;White-Gold&lt;/a&gt; itself, including the recently-discovered &lt;a href=\"Scroll%20of%20Precursor%20Saints\"&gt;Scroll of Precursor Saints&lt;/a&gt;, Tharanus was a critical supporter of Alessia's cause, disrupting supply routes through forged logistical orders and even leading his own battalion into some of the war's bloodiest conflicts. Sadly, the slanderous have sunk so low as to make preposterous accusations that I forged the scroll myself. Despicable.\nGiven the weakness of the Ayleids and the rather inspiring members of Alessia's retinue, the outcome of the war was determined before the first slaver was beheaded. The Slave Rebellion both teaches a cautionary lesson about the idiocy of trifling with the Daedra and demonstrates the power of men, who have rightfully ruled the heart of Tamriel since. As they always shall."}

He may not have heard where it is but there are &lt;a href=\"Lighthouse%20Attack%20Plans\"&gt;plans&lt;/a&gt; for some other attack floating around the camp. Untie Lucas so he can go home and ease his mother's mind, then find the plans before going back to the village.\nWhen back in the village, find Margot to see that her son has come back safely. She is happy because he arrived in time for dinner. Margot will express how it weights heavily on a mother's heart to worry about her son and also how she will never foget what the Vestige has done for her and that she hopes little Lucas grows up to be like them."}

They are a revision of the original \"&lt;a href=\"The%20Soft%20Doctrines%20of%20Magnus%20Invisible\"&gt;The Soft Doctrines of Magnus Invisible&lt;/a&gt;\". They were originally published on Goodall's Substack.\nContents.\n\"I. The Source and the Serpent\".\nIn the beginning were the false creators, two and the same: &lt;a href=\"The%20Tower%20%28Aurbis%29\"&gt;The Tower&lt;/a&gt;, the selfish word, the great lie, the headsplitter. The First created &lt;a href=\"Birthsigns\"&gt;the Twelve and its reflection&lt;/a&gt;. The Second created &lt;a href=\"Et%27Ada\"&gt;the Twenty-Two and its reflection&lt;/a&gt;. All were invisible under the starless sky. The sky broke and reflected again. Light on scattered light, mirror on broken mirror, myriad synecdochic shards shone. Among them, &lt;a href=\"Magnus\"&gt;Magnus&lt;/a&gt;, the brightest reflection.\nThe Thirty-Six and the Horde That Never Rests are hollow, unworthy of worship. They birthed us, created us, made us their children, their slaves, their prisoners, a mockery of their shortcomings.\nBefore the Thirty-Six were the weaver-workers, themselves woven and unworthy. First the Few, then the Many. Among them, Magnus, uniquely named. Be thankful, but do not bow.\nThe Thirty-Six are still &lt;a href=\"Nine%20Divines\"&gt;Eight and One&lt;/a&gt;, twice removed, even if &lt;a href=\"Men\"&gt;man&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"mer\"&gt;mer&lt;/a&gt; no longer recognize the quarters.\nIn the beginning were the wax words, encased in the tunnel between sea and sky. But the scribes swam the wrong way, descending into beats as their feathered servants flew to ascension. Leaking spread solidity. The Few made three copies, dead and unread, long buried in copycase. The Many made copies of copies of copies, potent imperfections.\n&lt;a href=\"Aurbis\"&gt;Aurbis&lt;/a&gt; is a prison. We are condemned to half-lives, recapitulating false creation.\n&lt;a href=\"Mundus\"&gt;Mundus&lt;/a&gt; is fog without frontiers, only edges. The fool mistakes edges for truth.\n&lt;a href=\"Nirn\"&gt;Nirn&lt;/a&gt; is an arena. We are eternal warriors, revived without consecration. We fight, love, eat, work, and die for recreation.\nOne chance at freedom: the eternal tempered by mortality, the ephemeral tempered by records. Few escape. \nDrink for the dead and the sleeping. Pay no heed to usurpers; their time is short.\nMagnus is Aedra Star and Magic Man. Magnus Invisible is more. Only a coward flees his creation. Only a hero dies holding the door.\nThe veil contains our tormentors: planets, guardians, &lt;a href=\"Magna%20Ge\"&gt;ge&lt;/a&gt;. We speak to them, but they are silent to us, their backs turned in their haste. Beyond &lt;a href=\"Aetherius\"&gt;Aetherius&lt;/a&gt; lie the false creators: the architects, sentencers of our misery. Beyond Aurbis: the uncreated. Dream a bridge.\nWe are slaves to the star-clock, which beats faster in every age. Only the drummer can stop the beat.\nPower is The Tower, encircled.\nTime is experience, but gold is incorruptible.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Akatosh\"&gt;Dragon&lt;/a&gt; is bound with noble sighs.\n\"II. Enantiodromia\".\nAs night becomes day and day becomes night, the emperor becomes a pauper and the criminal becomes a hero.\nAs experience corrupts innocence and innocence corrupts experience, the future corrupts the past and the past corrupts the future. As wasteful abundance creates poverty, a halcyon harvest is seeded by the starving.\nEvery hero is an image, a reflection, a tone played on the tightest string between the ur-mirrors of sky and sea. False heroes are the shattered reflections of the jailed jailer; a three-headed beast gnashing its own throats.\nGray Mundus is empty and full. Emptiness is gray. Fullness is gray. Magnus Invisible weeps for his grayest children.\nThe spiritual becomes material and the material becomes spiritual. The fool thinks they are equal. The heretic denies one and elevates the other. To the outsider, they are indiscrete.\nThe Word is eternal, heavy with meaning, unchanging, yet opening layer by layer to any seeker, showing parts of itself to each viewer, like a spinning prism, not the simple correspondence of mere words with the mundane.\nMer came down from the sky. Men rose up from the &lt;a href=\"Throat%20of%20the%20World\"&gt;mountain&lt;/a&gt;. The god of mer climbed to the stars. The god of men descended into the ground. Climbing is rougher than falling, but to &lt;a href=\"Beastfolk\"&gt;the beasts&lt;/a&gt;, the way down is the way up. When man, mer, and beast rise or fall together, the age is complete.\nOnly the &lt;a href=\"Trinimac\"&gt;shape-taker's&lt;/a&gt; respiration emptied the arc for the &lt;a href=\"Arkay\"&gt;thief's eye&lt;/a&gt;.\nMagnus and &lt;a href=\"Sithis\"&gt;Sithis&lt;/a&gt; are tears to the prior world and the next. When they meet the prisoner, the story ends.\n&lt;a href=\"The%20Serpent\"&gt;The serpent&lt;/a&gt; wanders to a tuneless tune, wondering why there are only twelve constellations to consume in the countless stars. &lt;a href=\"The%20Hist\"&gt;The Hist&lt;/a&gt; know its course.\nThe Magna-Ge expand as the &lt;a href=\"Ehlnofey\"&gt;Earth Bones&lt;/a&gt; diminish.\nThe feathered were the first to see the falling stars.\nMagnus Visible is blind magic.\nMagnus Invisible magnifies.\n&lt;a href=\"Lorkhan\"&gt;The Serpent&lt;/a&gt; is bound with shifting tones.\n\"III. The Roads\".\nThe well-trod road is swings and fire. It is worn to dust by the feet of children and pilgrims and restored by the west wind blowing over their corpses. The simplest walk this road until they tire of tedious murder. With proper steps, violence transforms. Yet the vanquished, as well as the victor, once believed they could bringNirn to perfection. This is the road of tradition, for the first champions had no choice but to follow this road, and the greatest of all heroes walk it by choice. Most who walk this road deny the others.\nThe shortest road is dishonest labor, paved with gold bricks, trodden by the feet of giants, and glued by the slime of forked tongues. The slothful savior is saved by the hidden window. The shortest road is not worth the journey. The destination is despair.\nThe road of beauty is untrodden by heroes. It winds weary as a river, always towards the stars, but never reaching the veil. Those happy fools, bright shining jewels, dreams more real than their vision, they never see the gray. Every birdsong a golden tone, every pocket a bouquet. They sing praises at dawn's beauty and are paid with the coinage of ghosts, which has no provenance.\nThe longest road is walked by old ruin. It's paving stones are yesterdays scales. It's claws ever-grasping at the gray are Pestilence, Pigme, The Falling Wall, Taskmaster of the Mechanical Horde, The Unspeaking, The Golden Tonic, The Shadow of Hours, and The Scale of Scales. It's tail-consuming head is Moment and Momentum. Hunger prowls the unshed skin. The road ends where claw, head, and hunger meet...until gossip reaches eternity via dis-ease.\nThe final road cannot be walked. The wretched gather up their ghosts and go.\nAnd what of you, you turner of heads? Where shall you pound your adamantium feet? What overgrown paths will you trod without a care? What lies shall pass your feathered lips? Which words shall you choose and choose again and find they made no difference? Which hapless beauty will grasp your life-stealing amulet? Who shall you caress with your corpse-tainted hands? At the end of your road, are you not a prisoner?\nReflections who walk are ruled by their images until they turn their gaze to another.\nThe doors are stuck, the curtains drawn, the constellations firm, the planets unerring in their courses. Twelve and One have an illusion of movement. Twenty-Two and One have an illusion of choice. Only the Serpent slides.\nHue is governed by momentum. As much as manifold &lt;a href=\"Meridia\"&gt;Meridia&lt;/a&gt; loves the Blind, even orphans cannot change their color.\nMagnus is bound in metal flames.\n\"IV. The Tower\".\nThe Tower is the first word, spoken by the second. It is a wall and a stair, a fortress and a prison.\nWhen a &lt;a href=\"Marukh\"&gt;monkey&lt;/a&gt; finds The Tower, he tries to knock it down, leap off, turn away. Leaving him defenseless. The Daedra dance.\nWhen a mer finds The Tower, he tries to climb it, build it, make it larger than the world. Leaving him alone in his loft. The Aedra love him as he loves himself.\nWhen a man finds The Tower, he makes it his home and cares for it as he would a helpless child. When such a man yields to beauty, The Tower drifts and bends and stretches...but stands.\nAll who find The Tower are infected with tyranny. Some succumb.\nAll who find The Tower are condemned to transcendence. Some succumb.\nWhether tyranny or transcendence, the Lie comes from the life of the mind. Aetherius always makes way for Mundus. Do not judge harshly by abstraction.\nWould you build a tower to heaven and pull it up behind you?\nWould you pull the stars down to earth and force your neighbor to live in your sky?\nWhether you free only yourself or enslave all the world, in the Lie you are incomplete.\nThe Tower is the memories of all guests, built stone by misshapen stone. An impossible edifice, crystallized chaos, a mountain of custard, a paper that spits flame but is never consumed, a dread glory to all climbers. Those who rip out chunks and replace them with patchwork words are the greatest criminals.\nThe Tower is the axle, the spear through the starry heart, the magne that line the lodestones. The Tower is the one place that lies within all the wheels of heaven.\nAnd when a tower falls? The wheel is unchained, spinning wildly, stirring up wheels within wheels. And when one of those wheels stands upright? There is your tower. The wheel obeys.\nAnd when a wheel breaks? The towers split, wander, grow, shrink, spin. And when one tower encompasses the rest? There is your wheel. The heavens are painted on its walls.\nNirn is bound in secret knots.\n\"V.\".\nThis is a tribute to absence, to the weaver-workers who tied the nots.\nAU-IM REFLECTS!\nTo the tyrant, abundance provokes reaction.\nOnly flawed things become their opposite.\nOnly a fool believes opposites are equal.\nGTSMGQPVKJTHMCZJAKVGMJKSUFZQTH\nGQJKHSJMHRMTGTHMCZJAKVGMHJQLFQGQTH\nGQIUPRPUHQIJMZJAKVGMGAJSUI\nGHKJOHQFWQGJMZJAKVGMJFMJ\nLoving is more perilous than a dragon, harder than steel. Returning love is more perilous than a nine province army, harder than ebony.\nLove for love's sake is meaningless. Love for one's own sake is emptiness. To the clerk in the counting-house, coins have no value. The poor man knows the shape and weight and flaws of each.\nGJKKIQTHKHOKKPHKJKZ\nGJKMHWQPRQFHGQPULQTHFK\nFQZUQZFQZPKWFQPPUIG\nFQCKHQTHKHOKKPHKJKZ\nRKKFGHMJKGFQWJUZQTHFK\nITHMMTFOWUPKTC\nPQQTCQTHKHOKKPHKJKZ\nPMQBGHMJKGHUKVPMUGQTHFK\nGFKHUSMBUJGJUG\nMMQFSQTHKHOKKPHKJKZ\nPUMHJQHKLMMVJQDKFRQVFK\nWMGAIJMHGKP\nFQPMUNQTHQFKZUHKJKZ\nPMUNQTHFKTVUFK\nSJMJAFLTWAGMMVMMPJK\nPPUHCKFSQCMMUI\nIAJQPLQTHKHOKKPHKJKZ\nGGQJMHLIQJMFKMMPVIQGGUJMFQTHQTC\nFKPKWTHMCZUIQVFK\nQPVMGMBJMQTHKHOKKP\nJKMHUZJAKRSJMGGMIQTHZJU\nLUSWMQKLKTHMMIQTHZJU\nZQCUPRFQBQCKTQBKPSJMJFAHQF\nLQHGSJMPVIQFHHGFMRQTHGM\nOUQFVJKGMFLQTHRK\nThis is the lesson of The Tower and The Serpent: every Wheel needs an Axis.\nThis is the lesson of Magnus and The Twins: every Reflection needs a Mirror.\nFire rejoices in fire.\nBlood rejoices in blood.\nQRMPJMGQWMKNQFQRMP\nHTSMPJMGQWMKNQFHTSMP\nZKKPVZJUQFMRHWQNQF\nMMQOJKIZJUFQIHWQNQF\nTHAFHJMQWMKNQF\nHTSMPHWQPRQF\nIKZQQFRJFUQ\nQSUIMJFUQMM"}

That was an &lt;a href=\"Mer\"&gt;Elvish&lt;/a&gt; name, and Pelinal was a scourge on that race, and not much given to irony. Pelinal was much too grim for that; even in youth he wore white hair, and trouble followed him. Perhaps his enemies named Pelinal of their own in their tongue, but that is doubtful, for it means \"glorious knight\", and he was neither to them.\nCertainly, many others added to that name during his days in Tamriel: he was Pelinal the Whitestrake because of his left hand, made of a killing light; he was Pelinal the Bloody, for he [drank] it in victory; he was Pelinal Insurgent, because he gave the crusades a face; he was Pelinal In Triumph, as the words eventually became synonymous, and men-at-arms gave thanks to the &lt;a href=\"Eight%20Divines\"&gt;Eight&lt;/a&gt; when they saw his banner coming through war; he was Pelinal the Blamer, for he was quick to admonish those allies of his that favored tactics that ran counter to his, that is, sword-theory; and he was Pelinal the Third, though whether this was because some said he was a god guiser, who had incarnated twice before already, or that, simpler, he was the third vision given to Perrif, anon &lt;a href=\"Alessia\"&gt;Alessia&lt;/a&gt;, in her prayers of liberation before he walked among the quarters of rebellion, is unknown.\n\"Volume 2: On His Coming\".\n\"[Editor's Note: Volumes 1-6 are taken from the so-called Reman Manuscript located in the Imperial Library.

Which I think is just another word for &lt;a href=\"Shezarr\"&gt;Shezarr Who Goes Missing&lt;/a&gt;...\n[You] made the first rain at his sundering [and that] is what I ask now for our alien masters...

[And then] &lt;a href=\"Kyne\"&gt;Kyne&lt;/a&gt; granted Perrif another symbol, a &lt;a href=\"Amulet%20of%20Kings\"&gt;diamond soaked red&lt;/a&gt; with the blood of elves, [whose] facets could [un-sector and form] into a man whose every angle could cut her jailers and a name: &lt;a href=\"PELIN-EL\"&gt;PELIN-EL&lt;/a&gt; [which is] \"The Star-Made Knight\" [and he] was arrayed in armor [from the future time].\nAnd he walked into the jungles of &lt;a href=\"Cyrod\"&gt;Cyrod&lt;/a&gt; already killing, Morihaus stamping at his side froth-bloody and bellowing from excitement because the Pelinal was come... [and Pelinal] came to Perrif's camp of rebels holding a sword and mace, both encrusted with the smashed viscera of elven faces, feathers and magic beads, which were the markings of the &lt;a href=\"Ayleidoon\"&gt;Ayleidoon&lt;/a&gt;, stuck to the redness that hung from his weapons, and he lifted them, saying: \"These were their eastern chieftains, no longer full of their talking.\"\n\"Volume 3: On His Enemy\".\n\"[Editor's Note: Volumes 1-6 are taken from the so-called Reman Manuscript located in the Imperial Library.

Mainly, though, he took it upon himself to slay the sorcerer-kings of the &lt;a href=\"Ayleid\"&gt;Ayleid&lt;/a&gt;s in pre-arranged open combats rather than at war; the fields of rebellion he left to the growing armies of the &lt;a href=\"Paravania\"&gt;Paravania&lt;/a&gt; and his bull nephew. Pelinal called out &lt;a href=\"Haromir%20of%20Copper%20and%20Tea\"&gt;Haromir of Copper and Tea&lt;/a&gt; into a duel at the &lt;a href=\"Sancre%20Tor\"&gt;Tor&lt;/a&gt;, and ate his neck-veins while screaming praise to &lt;a href=\"Reman\"&gt;Reman&lt;/a&gt;, a name that no one knew yet.\n&lt;a href=\"Gordhaur%20the%20Shaper\"&gt;Gordhaur the Shaper&lt;/a&gt;'s head was smashed upon the goat-faced altar of Ninendava, and in his wisdom Pelinal said a small plague spell to keep that evil from reforming by &lt;a href=\"Welkynd%20Stone\"&gt;welkynd&lt;/a&gt;-magic. Later that season, Pelinal slew &lt;a href=\"Hadhuul\"&gt;Hadhuul&lt;/a&gt; on the granite steps of &lt;a href=\"Ceya-Tar\"&gt;Ceya-Tar&lt;/a&gt;, the Fire King's spears knowing their first refute. For a time, no weapon of the Ayleids could pierce his armor, which Pelinal admitted was unlike any crafted by men, but would say no more even when pressed. When &lt;a href=\"Huna\"&gt;Huna&lt;/a&gt;, whom Pelinal raised from grain-slave to hoplite and loved well, took death from an arrowhead made from the beak of &lt;a href=\"Celethelel%20the%20Singer\"&gt;Celethelel the Singer&lt;/a&gt;, the Whitestrake went on his first Madness.\nHe wrought destruction from &lt;a href=\"Narlemae\"&gt;Narlemae&lt;/a&gt; all the way to &lt;a href=\"Celediil\"&gt;Celediil&lt;/a&gt;, and erased those lands from the maps of Elves and Men, and all things in them, and &lt;a href=\"Perrif\"&gt;Perrif&lt;/a&gt; was forced to make sacrifice to the Gods to keep them from leaving the earth in their disgust. And then came the storming of &lt;a href=\"White-Gold%20Tower\"&gt;White-Gold&lt;/a&gt;, where the Ayleids had made pact with the &lt;a href=\"Auroran\"&gt;Auroran&lt;/a&gt;s of &lt;a href=\"Meridia\"&gt;Meridia&lt;/a&gt;, and summoned them, and appointed the terrible and golden-hued \"half-Elf\" &lt;a href=\"Umaril%20the%20Unfeathered\"&gt;Umaril the Unfeathered&lt;/a&gt; as their champion\u2026 and, for the first time since his coming, it was Pelinal who was called out to battle by another, for Umaril had the blood of the &lt;a href=\"Et%27Ada\"&gt;'ada&lt;/a&gt; and would never know death.\n\"Volume 4: On his Deeds\".\n\"[Editor's Note: Volumes 1-6 are taken from the so-called Reman Manuscript located in the Imperial Library.

He entered the Gate at ... to win back the hands of the &lt;a href=\"Thousand-Strong%20of%20Sedor\"&gt;Thousand-Strong&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"Sedor\"&gt;Sedor&lt;/a&gt; (a tribe now unknown but famous in those days), which the &lt;a href=\"Ayleid\"&gt;Ayleid&lt;/a&gt;s had stolen in the night, two thousand hands that he brought back in a wagon made of demon-bone, whose wheels trailed the sound of women when ill at heart...

He led them anyway into the heart of the hinterland west, to drive the Ayleids inward, towards the &lt;a href=\"White-Gold%20Tower\"&gt;Tower of White-Gold&lt;/a&gt;, a slow retreating circle that could not understand the power of Man\u2019s sudden liberty, and what fury-idea that brought.\nHis mace crushed the &lt;a href=\"Thundernachs\"&gt;Thundernachs&lt;/a&gt; that &lt;a href=\"Umaril\"&gt;Umaril&lt;/a&gt; sent as harriers on the rebellion's long march back south and east, and carried Morihaus-Breath-of-Kyne to &lt;a href=\"Zuathas%20the%20Clever-Cutting%20Man\"&gt;Zuathas the Clever-Cutting Man&lt;/a&gt; (a &lt;a href=\"nede\"&gt;nede&lt;/a&gt; with a keptu name) for healing when the bull had fallen to a volley of bird beaks. And, of course, at the &lt;a href=\"Council%20of%20Skiffs\"&gt;Council of Skiffs&lt;/a&gt;, where all of the Paravania's armies and all of the Nords shook with fear at the storming of White-Gold, so much so that the Al-Esh herself counseled delay, Pelinal grew furious, and made names of Umaril, and made names of what cowards he thought he saw around him, and then made for the Tower by himself, for Pelinal often acted without thought.\n\"Volume 5: On His Love of Morihaus\".\n\"[Editor's Note: Volumes 1-6 are taken from the so-called Reman Manuscript located in the Imperial Library.

It is famous, though, that the two talked of each other as family, with Morihaus as the lesser, and that Pelinal loved him and called him nephew, but these could be merely the fancies of immortals. Never did Pelinal counsel Morihaus in time of war, for the man-bull fought magnificently, and led men well, and never resorted to Madness, but the Whitestrake did warn against the growing love with &lt;a href=\"Perrif\"&gt;Perrif&lt;/a&gt;.\n\"We are ada, Mor, and change things through love. We must take care lest we beget more monsters on this earth. If you do not desist, she will take to you, and you will transform all &lt;a href=\"Cyrod\"&gt;Cyrod&lt;/a&gt; if you do this.\" And to this the bull became shy, for he was a bull, and he felt his form too ugly for the &lt;a href=\"Paravania\"&gt;Paravania&lt;/a&gt; at all times, especially when she disrobed for him. He snorted, though, and shook his nose-hoop into the light of the &lt;a href=\"Secunda\"&gt;Secunda&lt;/a&gt; moon and said, \"She is like this shine on my nose-hoop here: an accident sometimes, but whenever I move my head at night, she is there.

The Whitestrake cracked the floor with his mace and they withdrew, and he said, \"Bring me &lt;a href=\"Umaril\"&gt;Umaril&lt;/a&gt; that called me out!\" ... [And] while mighty in his aspect and wicked, deathless-golden Umaril favored ruin-from-afar over close combat and so he tarried in the shadows of the &lt;a href=\"White-Gold%20Tower\"&gt;white tower&lt;/a&gt; before coming forth. More soldiers were sent against Pelinal to die, and yet they managed to pierce his armor with axes and arrows, for Umaril had wrought each one by long varliance, which he had been hoarding since his first issue [of challenge.]...\n[Presently] the half-Elf [showed himself] bathed in [&lt;a href=\"Meridia\"&gt;Meridia&lt;/a&gt;n light] ... and he listed his bloodline in the Ayleidoon and spoke of his father, a god of the [previous &lt;a href=\"kalpa\"&gt;kalpa&lt;/a&gt;'s] World-River and taking great delight in the heavy-breathing of Pelinal who had finally bled...

It was Morihaus who found the Whitestrake's head, which the kings had left to prove their deeds and they spoke and Pelinal said things of regrets... but the &lt;a href=\"Alessian%20Rebellion\"&gt;rebellion&lt;/a&gt; had turned anyway...

It is, however, likely closest to the original spoken or sung form of the Song, and therefore has great value despite its brevity. Strangely, it appears that Pelinal is present at &lt;a href=\"Alessia\"&gt;Alessia&lt;/a&gt;'s deathbed, although he was killed by &lt;a href=\"Umaril\"&gt;Umaril&lt;/a&gt; earlier in the saga (years before Alessia's death).

That was an &lt;a href=\"Mer\"&gt;Elvish&lt;/a&gt; name, and Pelinal was a scourge on that race, and not much given to irony.

Later that season, Pelinal slew &lt;a href=\"Hadhuul\"&gt;Hadhuul&lt;/a&gt; on the granite steps of &lt;a href=\"Ceya-Tar\"&gt;Ceya-Tar&lt;/a&gt;, the Fire King's spears knowing their first refute.

He led them anyway into the heart of the hinterland west, to drive the Ayleids inward, towards the &lt;a href=\"White-Gold%20Tower\"&gt;Tower of White-Gold&lt;/a&gt;, a slow retreating circle that could not understand the power of Man\u2019s sudden liberty, and what fury-idea that brought.\nHis mace crushed the &lt;a href=\"Thundernachs\"&gt;Thundernachs&lt;/a&gt; that &lt;a href=\"Umaril\"&gt;Umaril&lt;/a&gt; sent as harriers on the rebellion's long march back south and east, and carried Morihaus-Breath-of-Kyne to &lt;a href=\"Zuathas%20the%20Clever-Cutting%20Man\"&gt;Zuathas the Clever-Cutting Man&lt;/a&gt; (a &lt;a href=\"nede\"&gt;nede&lt;/a&gt; with a keptu name) for healing when the bull had fallen to a volley of bird beaks.

Pelinal was much too grim for that; even in youth he wore white hair, and trouble followed him. Perhaps his enemies named Pelinal of their own in their tongue, but that is doubtful, for it means \"glorious knight\", and he was neither to them. Certainly, many others added to that name during his days in &lt;a href=\"Tamriel\"&gt;Tamriel&lt;/a&gt;: he was Pelinal the Whitestrake because of his left hand, made of a killing light; he was Pelinal the Bloody, for he [drank] it in victory; he was Pelinal Insurgent, because he gave the crusades a face; he was Pelinal In Triumph, as the words eventually became synonymous, and men-at-arms gave thanks to the &lt;a href=\"Eight%20Divines\"&gt;Eight&lt;/a&gt; when they saw his banner coming through war; he was Pelinal the Blamer, for he was quick to admonish those allies of his that favored tactics that ran counter to his, that is, sword-theory; and he was Pelinal the Third, though whether this was because some said he was a god guiser, who had incarnated twice before already, or that, simpler, he was the third vision given to Perrif, anon &lt;a href=\"Alessia\"&gt;Alessia&lt;/a&gt;, in her prayers of liberation before he walked among the quarters of rebellion, is unknown."}

Later that season, Pelinal slew &lt;a href=\"Hadhuul\"&gt;Hadhuul&lt;/a&gt; on the granite steps of &lt;a href=\"Ceyatatar%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Ceya-Tar&lt;/a&gt;, the Fire King's spears knowing their first refute.

And then came the storming of &lt;a href=\"White-Gold%20Tower%20%28Online%29\"&gt;White-Gold&lt;/a&gt;, where the Ayleids had made pact with the &lt;a href=\"Auroran\"&gt;Auroran&lt;/a&gt;s of &lt;a href=\"Meridia%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Meridia&lt;/a&gt;, and summoned them, and appointed the terrible and golden-hued \"half-Elf\" &lt;a href=\"Umaril\"&gt;Umaril the Unfeathered&lt;/a&gt; as their champion\u2026 and, for the first time since his coming, it was Pelinal who was called out to battle by another, for Umaril had the blood of the 'ada and would never know death."}

And, of course, at the Council of Skiffs, where all of the Paravania's armies and all of the Nords shook with fear at the storming of White-Gold, so much so that the Al-Esh herself counseled delay, Pelinal grew furious, and made names of Umaril, and made names of what cowards he thought he saw around him, and then made for the Tower by himself, for Pelinal often acted without thought."}

The arena is full of spike traps, but they will not trigger during combat.

Speak with him and you will discover that the dremora have performed vile experiments on him and melded his soul with that of an alchemist named &lt;a href=\"Zur\"&gt;Zur&lt;/a&gt;. After you offer to help them, Zur will take over. Speak to him and he will tell you that the device needed to unmeld them is inside the laboratory, but the path is blocked by rubble. He will ask you to collect his notes and a bottle of Pearl Tincture so he can craft something to get past the rubble. \nThe first note will be to your south, behind a piece of wall, by a bookshelf. Head further south from here and you will find the second note on a stone fence. From here, head northwest and into the structure to find the Pearl Tincture. Once you enter, Zur will appear. You can speak with him, but he will not say anything important. \nNow that you have all the ingredients, head southeast along the path to the entrance of the Vile Laboratory. Inside, you will find Zur again. Give him the ingredients and he will make the potion. Gadris will take over then; speak with him to receive the potion. He will tell you what you are looking for once you are in there; you should get &lt;a href=\"The%20Notebook%20of%20Mage%20Gadris\"&gt;his notebook&lt;/a&gt; from the metallurgy worshop, so that you can use the notes to craft antipodal rods that will help separate Gadris and Zur. \nAfter speaking with Gadris, you will drink the potion and turn into a kind of tiny monkey. Crawl past the rubble in this tiny state. You will stay in this monkey form for the next part of the dungeon, but fortunately there are no enemies. You will have to perform some acrobatics to get past all the rubble; walking on the pipes is generally the way to go. At the end, you will have to crawl through another rubble-blocked wall, after which you will transform back into your normal self. You will find yourself in the metallurgy workshop; Gadris's notebook will be on the table in the center of the room surrounded by green water. The water does not do anything, so do not worry about stepping in it. \nThe notebook will list three ingredients you need to create the antipodal rods. You will need &lt;a href=\"Ebony%20Ore\"&gt;Ebony Ore&lt;/a&gt;, a &lt;a href=\"crystalline%20Essencs%20Matrix\"&gt;crystalline Essencs Matrix&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Refined%20Void%20Salts\"&gt;Refined Void Salts&lt;/a&gt;. Fortunately, these can all be found in this room. The Void Salts are on a table in the southeast, the Ebony Ore is in a pool of green water in the southwest and the essence matrix is on a table in the northwest. Once you have all of them, Zur will teleport into the room. He will warn you that the dwemer constructs are becoming active, and will tell you to read Gadris's &lt;a href=\"Catalyst%20Notes\"&gt;Catalyst Notes&lt;/a&gt; on the central table. These notes wimm mention that Corrupted Blood is necessary as a catalyst to create the rods, and that the Daedra keep a stash of the stuff in the southern room. Head there and kill &lt;a href=\"Phazkad\"&gt;the daedra&lt;/a&gt; guarding the blood, then take the vial and return to the main room. \nYou will see that the dwemer constructs have overtaken the room. Gadris will be by the door, telling you to melt the components and craft two rods out of them. Head for the forge in the southwest of the room to melt the ingredients, then use the anvil to make rods out of them. After you are done, head through the passage to the northwest room. At the door, you will find Gadris, who will tell you that you need to use the same machine that melded their souls to separate them again. You will first need to find a crystal to power the device though. Head into the room and grab the crystal; it will be in the center of the room, guarded by &lt;a href=\"Overseer%20Xvarik\"&gt;Overseer Xvarik&lt;/a&gt;. This crystal is actually one of the &lt;a href=\"Lights%20of%20Meridia\"&gt;Lights of Meridia&lt;/a&gt; you need for the quest &lt;a href=\"The%20Army%20of%20Meridia\"&gt;The Army of Meridia&lt;/a&gt;. Once you have it, head for the dwemer device on the far end of the room. when you approach it, Zur will appear. Speak with him, then place the crystal and the rods into the machine. At this point, you will have to choose whether you wish to save Gadris or Zur. Make your choice by pulling the appropriate lever. \nSpeak with whoever you saved, and they will tell you that the door is unlocked and they can create a portal to somehwere safe once outside. Grab the crystal and head outside. The person you saved will be down the ledge, so you will have to jump. Speak with them to finish the quest.\nReward.\n&lt;a href=\"Soul-Meld%20Staff\"&gt;Soul-Meld Staff&lt;/a&gt;"}

They have memories of stalking through the vines, of flying through the canopy. Of hunting and killing and eating. When we shape the bone into arrows, we prepare a Death Story, and the bone we choose has great meaning. Some laugh at this or roll their eyes, calling any arrow \"just an arrow,\" but the &lt;a href=\"Bosmer%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Bosmer&lt;/a&gt; know bones tell the best tales.\nBones from birds of prey rarely miss, and those of great lizards and snakes are quick and sharp. Arrows made from prey creatures are fleet, those from hunters bite deep into their marks. Cheerful arrows for warning shots are best made from monkeys. The more dangerous the beast, the more deadly the result.\nThese are but a few we know:\nThe river droop, torpid bottom-dweller, bristles with venomous spines that induce sleep plagued by nightmares. The size of a large dog, it is lazy and easy to catch, but it is tricky to handle and worthless to eat. An arrow fashioned from its dense ribs and spine carries the weight of sluggish rivers and tortured sleep, and it dulls a foe's senses.\nWounds from &lt;a href=\"senche-tiger\"&gt;senche-tiger&lt;/a&gt; arrows bleed foes dry. They should be cut jagged and cruel, like the claws of the beast. They are swift and silent, remembering the way to stalk through the undergrowth and pounce, thirsty for the tang of warm blood. Bones from a senche-tiger you did not kill do not speak with the same power; respect must be earned.\nOld whispers say that arrows made from the mighty swamp-beast, the &lt;a href=\"Wamasu%20%28Online%29\"&gt;wamasu&lt;/a&gt;, carry a jolt that rattles deep inside the bones. Pursuing this terror is a worthy task; it lurks deep in the mires of Black Marsh and slaughters nearly all who stumble upon it. Its bones shine black as night. Touching them tingles. The power lingers for years.\nThese truths are not often written, like so much of my people's knowledge, so treat them with honor. Know that every archer favors a different beast and forms a bond with it through the hunt. May you find your own, and may your shots strike true."}

Dare not share with anyone. The true source of the formula. It seemed too arcane, too brilliant for even a great alchemist to develop. Not that I couldn't likely produce something similar given enough time and resources, but my method, my language, would never be so... flawless. Even I can admit that.\nI found the answer. It was staring at me all this time in the middle of the shrine. &lt;a href=\"Clavicus%20Vile%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Clavicus Vile&lt;/a&gt;. A maker of deals, granter of wishes, and not one I would ever wish to be indebted to.\nIt seems this ruin was stumbled upon once before in a very similar fashion to how we found it. It is likely they were the previous owners of &lt;a href=\"Vassir-Didanat%20Mine\"&gt;Vassir-Didanat&lt;/a&gt; mine. It's a well-kept secret that the mine is not particularly rich. It produces barely enough ebony to make it worth working at all. And these mer that came before us grew desperate. They called out to Vile.\nA particular lack of wisdom and foresight it was that made them wish for an endless source of &lt;a href=\"Ebony%20Ore%20%28Online%29\"&gt;ebony&lt;/a&gt;. One must choose words carefully when dealing with &lt;a href=\"Daedra\"&gt;Daedra&lt;/a&gt;. Although in this case it may have been better to make no deal at all. Regardless, some pact was made and the formula came to them. They must have successfully brewed it, for we found statues here dating back centuries. But suspiciously they kept very little records about their progress, or how they used it.\nIn truth, knowing this fact makes me somewhat uneasy. Sometimes I feel like I can hear the statue of Clavicus Vile whispering, or laughing softly to itself. But I made no deal with him. I am simply studying the result. He holds no sway over me."}

Elder spinners often speak entirely in metaphors, which makes them difficult to understand, even by other Bosmer. Some believe the spinners go insane as they age and this strange way of speech is merely a symptom of that madness.\nDo not be deceived! Spinners have &lt;a href=\"Magic\"&gt;magical&lt;/a&gt; powers, or at least keen insights. They tell stories not only of the past, but of the future, and their oft-confusing tales speak of upcoming events with remarkable, though often baffling, accuracy.\nOne more note: despite the popular belief that spinners only move when carried, the priests of Y'ffre can walk on their own. While they seldom travel far from their homes, some do so when the need arises. It is likely that other Wood Elves, fearing the loss of their spinners, spread the rumor that they cannot travel on their own to discourage such risky expeditions."}

He asks the Dragonborn to go to the &lt;a href=\"Solitude%20Lighthouse\"&gt;Solitude Lighthouse&lt;/a&gt; and put out the fire there so that the ship will wreck on the nearby coast, then go talk to his sister\u00a0&lt;a href=\"Deeja\"&gt;Deeja&lt;/a&gt;. Unbeknownst to the Dragonborn, it is a setup that Jaree-Ra planned in order to attempt to kill the player, to avoid having to reward them.\nBackground.\n\"Jaree-Ra on the Solitude docks has an offer for me.\"\nWalkthrough.\nExtinguish the fire in the Solitude Lighthouse.\nGo upstairs and activate the fire to put it out.

The corpses of the sailors and the Imperial soldiers may be looted along the way. Deeja will first thank the Dragonborn for helping with the Solitude Lighthouse but suddenly state that you have earned a quick death, just before attacking. The note on her corpse will reveal where Jaree-Ra can be found.\nIt is optional to kill all the Blackblood Marauders before talking to Deeja, along with taking the loot now from their boat before the marauders leave the Icerunner with it, or later at the end of the quest chain. Taking it straight from the boat may count as stealing.\nDeeja\u00a0can\u00a0be killed without speaking to her and the story will still progress, although there is the risk that the quest will not update (). When exiting the Icerunner it is clear that Deeja was indeed telling the truth about the loot already being gone. Only one Blackblood Marauder remains outside and all but one long boat gone.\nTravel to Broken Oar Grotto and Kill Jaree-Ra.\nBroken Oar Grotto can be found along the coast, northwest of the Solitude Lighthouse. Several beached longboats are clustered near the entrance. Blackblood Marauders patrol the grotto. Jaree-Ra will be on or near the large scaffolding in the area's center, guarded by more Marauders and &lt;a href=\"Captain%20Hargar\"&gt;Captain Hargar&lt;/a&gt;.\nKilling Jaree-Ra completes the quest. After the fight, a key can be looted from his corpse that opens the Icerunner's loot chest. Despite Jaree-Ra's promise, there is no reward for this quest. However, there is plenty of loot in Broken Oar Grotto, including a random spellbook and 300\u2013500 pieces."}

She does not regret losing her shadow and her arcane powers from Nocturnal's machinations, but is rather glad she has become a great teacher to initiates and would gladly pass on wisdom to her students.\nBackground.\nIn her youth, Lilatha was an initiate of the Psijic Order in &lt;a href=\"1E%202920\"&gt;1E 2920&lt;/a&gt;.

Later on, some time in the &lt;a href=\"Second%20Era\"&gt;Second Era&lt;/a&gt; prior to the &lt;a href=\"Planemeld\"&gt;Planemeld&lt;/a&gt;, Lilatha traveled far beyond the boundaries of civilization, where \"the fabric of the &lt;a href=\"Mundus\"&gt;Mundus&lt;/a&gt; grows thin.\" She was reporting missives directed towards &lt;a href=\"Iachesis\"&gt;Iachesis&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"Ritemaster\"&gt;Ritemaster&lt;/a&gt; of the Order. Lilatha later traveled to the &lt;a href=\"Isle%20of%20Dranil%20Kir\"&gt;Isle of Dranil Kir&lt;/a&gt; to investigate a Psijic scrying device, but unexpectedly found &lt;a href=\"Divayth%20Fyr%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Divayth Fyr&lt;/a&gt; performing a Daedric ritual within the ruins.

Lillandril is the home of the &lt;a href=\"Sapiarchs\"&gt;Sapiarchs&lt;/a&gt;, a group of &lt;a href=\"Altmer\"&gt;Altmer&lt;/a&gt;i scholars that are talent in various topics, including &lt;a href=\"Ceremoniarchy\"&gt;Ceremoniarchy&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Altmeri%20Regal%20Praxis\"&gt;Altmeri Regal Praxis&lt;/a&gt;. The leaders of the province come here before becoming royalty.\nDescription.\nGeography.\nLillandril is a port town found in the northwestern peninsula that overlooks the &lt;a href=\"Eltheric%20Ocean\"&gt;Eltheric Ocean&lt;/a&gt;, essentially the great unknown of the west. The city-state of Lillandril is built atop of cliffs overlooking the Ocean. The area itself is not well suited for the settlement as big as Lillandril, so the city is not as large as other city-states in the province (i.e. &lt;a href=\"Skywatch\"&gt;Skywatch&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Alinor\"&gt;Alinor&lt;/a&gt;). It is walled-off, with a single road connecting it to the rest of the Summerset Isle. The nearby fortress of &lt;a href=\"Sea%20Keep\"&gt;Sea Keep&lt;/a&gt; serves as a regional bulwark for Lillandril, being almost larger than the city it protects. The main gate of Lillandril is located on the eastern end of the city; there is a path that derives from the road leading to the gate, which leads to the Lillandril docks. After the gate is the lower town square, which connects to the docks and the rest of the city, here is &lt;a href=\"the%20Shrewd%20Brew\"&gt;the Shrewd Brew&lt;/a&gt;, the local inn. The main road rotates to the top and goes south towards the end of the hill. The northern town square holds the local guilds, such as the &lt;a href=\"Mages%20Guild\"&gt;Mages Guild&lt;/a&gt; chapter, which is very prevalent in Lillandril. Continuing onto the road will lead to the entrance of the &lt;a href=\"Sapiarchs%27%20Labyrinth\"&gt;Sapiarchs' Labyrinth&lt;/a&gt;, which is disconnected from the city, being found an island off the coast. The only way to the College is through a portal, which is at the end of the street. Near the portal is the local seat of power, as well as an overlook of the southern town square.\nHistory.\n&lt;a href=\"Second%20Era\"&gt;Second Era&lt;/a&gt;.\nDuring the &lt;a href=\"Interregnum\"&gt;Interregnum&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"2E%20583\"&gt;2E 583&lt;/a&gt;, the city-state of Lillandril was ruled by a Kinlady, whose name is currently unknown. At the time, Lillandril contained a rivalry with the &lt;a href=\"Mages%20Guild\"&gt;Mages Guild&lt;/a&gt; chapter in the city and the &lt;a href=\"Sapiarchs\"&gt;Sapiarchs&lt;/a&gt; in their off coast &lt;a href=\"College%20of%20Sapiarchs\"&gt;college&lt;/a&gt;. But recently, a member of the Mages Guild, &lt;a href=\"Emile%20Oncent\"&gt;Emile Oncent&lt;/a&gt; had murdered the Sapiarch, &lt;a href=\"Haladan\"&gt;Haladan&lt;/a&gt;, which led to Oncent's imprisonment in the Lillandril chapter of the &lt;a href=\"Fighters%20Guild\"&gt;Fighters Guild&lt;/a&gt;. However, it was later revealed that both Oncent and Haladan had attempted to help their long-time friend, who had contracted a deadly disease that turns people into stone-malformed creatures. To cure her, they gave &lt;a href=\"Norasea\"&gt;Norasea&lt;/a&gt;, their friend, &lt;a href=\"Porphyric%20Hemophilia\"&gt;Porphyric Hemophilia&lt;/a&gt;, otherwise known as &lt;a href=\"Vampirism\"&gt;Vampirism&lt;/a&gt; to kill off the disease. With Norasea cured, Haladan sought to cure her friend, &lt;a href=\"Gerwerdel\"&gt;Gerwerdel&lt;/a&gt;, who had unfortunately succumbed to the disease and killed Haladan. To make sure Norasea was not killed for her vampirism, Oncent escaped with Haladan's body and claimed to murder him, to keep both Norasea alive and Haladan's reputation intact. It is unknown whether Oncent remained in prison or was freed. But eventually, the case was resolved.\n&lt;a href=\"Third%20Era\"&gt;Third Era&lt;/a&gt;.\nDuring the &lt;a href=\"Imperial%20Simulacrum\"&gt;Imperial Simulacrum&lt;/a&gt; from &lt;a href=\"3E%20389\"&gt;3E 389&lt;/a&gt; to &lt;a href=\"3E%20399\"&gt;3E 399&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Emperor\"&gt;Emperor&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Uriel%20Septim%20VII\"&gt;Uriel Septim VII&lt;/a&gt; was imprisoned along with &lt;a href=\"Talin%20Warhaft\"&gt;Talin Warhaft&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;a href=\"Deadlands\"&gt;Deadlands&lt;/a&gt; by &lt;a href=\"Jagar%20Tharn\"&gt;Jagar Tharn&lt;/a&gt;. Tharn planned for months to capture the throne, and he was able to achieve so in ten years. Tharn had a powerful weapon called the &lt;a href=\"Staff%20of%20Chaos\"&gt;Staff of Chaos&lt;/a&gt;, and he split it into nine pieces and scattered them across Tamriel, the staff was the only thing keeping Uriel Septim and Warhaft in &lt;a href=\"Oblivion\"&gt;Oblivion&lt;/a&gt;. A warrior escaped his clutches and traveled all corners of Tamriel to retrieve the missing pieces. The hero was known as the &lt;a href=\"Eternal%20Champion\"&gt;Eternal Champion&lt;/a&gt;, and he assembled the staff and defeated Jagar Tharn at the &lt;a href=\"Imperial%20Palace\"&gt;Imperial Palace&lt;/a&gt;. The Eternal Champion had at one point visited the city of Lillandril in their quest to recover the pieces. The city of Lillandril was under the rule of &lt;a href=\"King%20Corridalf\"&gt;King Corridalf&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe Eternal Champion reached the city of Lillandril on their quest to find the fifth piece of the Staff. Through the visions of &lt;a href=\"Ria%20Silmane\"&gt;Ria Silmane&lt;/a&gt; and rumors from the people, the Champion had traveled to the northern coast, to the city of Lillandril in the province of the Summerset Isles. There the traveler ventured to the local &lt;a href=\"Mages%20Guild\"&gt;Mages Guild&lt;/a&gt; where they met &lt;a href=\"Corim%20Ashlen\"&gt;Corim Ashlen&lt;/a&gt;, the loremaster of the Guild. Ashlen gives the Eternal Champion a proposition where if they retrieved a diamond from the priests of the &lt;a href=\"Temple%20of%20the%20Mad%20God%20%28Location%29\"&gt;Temple of the Mad God&lt;/a&gt;, then he would reveal the location of the piece. After defeating the priests at their stronghold, Ashlen showed the way to the &lt;a href=\"Crystal%20Tower\"&gt;Crystal Tower&lt;/a&gt;, a mystical tower located in the eastern end of the Island. It was there that the Eternal Champion had obtained the fifth piece of the staff. The Champion had moved on to find the sixth piece of the staff somewhere in Tamriel."}

{"id": "6336", "revid": "17401442", "url": "https://elderscrolls.fandom.com/wiki?curid=6336", "title": "Lilmoth", "text": "Lilmoth is one of the eight major cities in the province of &lt;a href=\"Black%20Marsh\"&gt;Black Marsh&lt;/a&gt;, being the capital of the region of &lt;a href=\"Murkmire\"&gt;Murkmire&lt;/a&gt;. Lilmoth is colloquially known as, the \"Festering Jewel of Black Marsh.\" It is known for the sundered Imperial Villas of the Old Imperial Lilmoth, built during the Empire's expansion into Black Marsh. Lilmoth is ruled by a council of high-class merchants that have garnered influence throughout Murkmire.\nDescription.\nGeography.\nThe city-state of Lilmoth is located along the south-central coast, on the shores of the &lt;a href=\"Oliis%20Bay\"&gt;Oliis Bay&lt;/a&gt;, which like the various other waterways of Black Marsh, eventually lead into the deep marsh and the dark forests of &lt;a href=\"Murkwood\"&gt;Murkwood&lt;/a&gt;. And like other cities in Black Marsh, areas of Lilmoth are sinking into the environment, with the &lt;a href=\"Statue%20of%20Xhon-Mehl\"&gt;Statue of Xhon-Mehl&lt;/a&gt; sinking, with only the lower snout peeking out, sometime after &lt;a href=\"4E%206\"&gt;4E 6&lt;/a&gt;. The Oliis Bay is surrounded by mangroves, much like the entire coast, and &lt;a href=\"Sea%20Drakes%20%28Lore%29\"&gt;Sea Drakes&lt;/a&gt; inhabit the area. Land south of Lilmoth is used for agriculture, either rice or other tropical crops. The &lt;a href=\"Hereguard%20Plantation\"&gt;Hereguard Plantation&lt;/a&gt; has been traditionally a &lt;a href=\"Breton\"&gt;Breton&lt;/a&gt; settlement for many years, even with the arrival of &lt;a href=\"An-Xileel\"&gt;An-Xileel&lt;/a&gt;. The site of Lilmoth had contained an ancient temple settlement, as seen with the Pyramid of &lt;a href=\"Ixtaxh-thtithil-meht\"&gt;Ixtaxh-thtithil-meht&lt;/a&gt;, which was slowly excavated by the An-Xileel. Lilmoth region is territory far from the &lt;a href=\"Imperial%20City\"&gt;Imperial City&lt;/a&gt;, and so the modern-day magic guilds, such as &lt;a href=\"the%20Synod\"&gt;the Synod&lt;/a&gt;, do not have a conclave in Lilmoth, with the only one found 400 miles of the Oliis Bay. The nearest settlements around Lilmoth are &lt;a href=\"Rockpark\"&gt;Rockpark&lt;/a&gt; to the east, and &lt;a href=\"Alten%20Meirhall\"&gt;Alten Meirhall&lt;/a&gt; to the west.\nLilmoth is known for ancient Imperial villas, to which the area calls it, &lt;a href=\"Old%20Imperial%20Lilmoth\"&gt;Old Imperial Lilmoth&lt;/a&gt;. These homes are no longer usable, as the forces of nature had enveloped them in an entanglement of vines and overgrown bamboo &amp; sleeping palms along the floor. They are covered in a Lucan mold, which emits a pale glow. This area is entirely abandoned, a shell of its former self. The most notorious neighborhood in Lilmoth is &lt;a href=\"Pusbottom\"&gt;Pusbottom&lt;/a&gt;, considered to be a dodgy place that even the An-Xileel would not dare to enter. It is known as the vile center of Lilmoth, as the criminal underground of the Lilmoth region are known to reside in Pusbottom. Various actions, such as &lt;a href=\"Skooma\"&gt;Skooma&lt;/a&gt; dealing are conducted here. Along the &lt;a href=\"Padomaic%20Ocean\"&gt;Padomaic Ocean&lt;/a&gt; coast, the Lilmoth Waterfront can be found. The Waterfront is shaped like a long cross, and it can be seen as a town, within a city. The An-Xileel of Lilmoth had prevented faraway travelers from entering their city, and so the foreigners are found here. Traders from as far as &lt;a href=\"Colovia\"&gt;Colovia&lt;/a&gt; sell their goods.\nHistory.\n&lt;a href=\"First%20Era\"&gt;First Era&lt;/a&gt;.\nLilmoth's Origin; The Saxhleel &amp; Lilmothiit.\nThe origins of Lilmoth is largely unknown, but the general region, as well as, the city has ties to the beast-folk known as the &lt;a href=\"Lilmothiit\"&gt;Lilmothiit&lt;/a&gt;, a nomadic race of vulpine-men that were among the various races in Black Marsh. The race has ties to the &lt;a href=\"Khajiit\"&gt;Khajiit&lt;/a&gt; of Elsweyr, even the name of beastfolk derives from &lt;a href=\"Ta%27agra\"&gt;Ta'agra&lt;/a&gt;, the Khajiiti language. Lilmothiit means \"one who is from Lilmoth,\" and since the city-state of &lt;a href=\"Blackrose\"&gt;Blackrose&lt;/a&gt; was originally a settlement built by the Lilmothiit, it implies that either the city or the general area, is the namesake of the Lilmothiit. The Lilmothiit had built the original settlement of Lilmoth, but as time went on, the fox-folk had lost their homes, as at one point, the city-states of Lilmoth and Blackrose had turned into cities of the Saxhleel, otherwise more commonly known as, the Argonians. Merchants and travelers overwhelmed the city, turning it into a prominent trading town.\nThe Blackwater War &amp; Falco's Campaign.\nIn &lt;a href=\"1E%202811\"&gt;1E 2811&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"Second%20Empire\"&gt;Second Empire&lt;/a&gt; of Cyrodiil waged war with the Black Marshes, long before it was the province that is known to this day. It had begun with the borderlands, as it soon pushed into the regions of the inner marsh. Control over the &lt;a href=\"Imperial%20Legion\"&gt;Imperial Legion&lt;/a&gt; had shifted, as it did in &lt;a href=\"1E%202833\"&gt;1E 2833&lt;/a&gt; when &lt;a href=\"Regulus%20Sardecus\"&gt;Regulus Sardecus&lt;/a&gt; had passed away, and &lt;a href=\"Lucinia%20Falco\"&gt;Lucinia Falco&lt;/a&gt; had assumed the mantle, revising the strategy for the &lt;a href=\"Blackwater%20War\"&gt;Blackwater War&lt;/a&gt;. General Falco took to the seas, establishing the front along the coast, around the cities of Lilmoth and &lt;a href=\"Archon\"&gt;Archon&lt;/a&gt;. In conjunction with the &lt;a href=\"Diamond%20Marines\"&gt;Diamond Marines&lt;/a&gt; of the Imperial Legion, fought the countless bands of pirates found throughout this general area of the province, using the city-state of &lt;a href=\"Gideon\"&gt;Gideon&lt;/a&gt; as her base of operations. Unlike her predecessors, Falco had split her armies, rather than using a single force against the versatile Argonians. In &lt;a href=\"1E%202837\"&gt;1E 2837&lt;/a&gt;, the Blackwater War was over and the Second Empire claimed the province of Black Marsh as their own.\nWarchief Ulaqth &amp; the Four-Score War.\nDuring the &lt;a href=\"Four%20Score%20War\"&gt;Four Score War&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"1E%202920\"&gt;1E 2920&lt;/a&gt;, the city-state of Lilmoth was under the reign of &lt;a href=\"Warchief%20Ulaqth\"&gt;Warchief Ulaqth&lt;/a&gt;, was among the leading forces in the Empire's front against the province of &lt;a href=\"Morrowind\"&gt;Morrowind&lt;/a&gt;. The &lt;a href=\"Battle%20of%20Bodrum\"&gt;Battle of Bodrum&lt;/a&gt; commenced on the 20th of &lt;a href=\"First%20Seed\"&gt;First Seed&lt;/a&gt;, on the border township of &lt;a href=\"Bodrum\"&gt;Bodrum&lt;/a&gt;, within the &lt;a href=\"Valus%20Mountains\"&gt;Valus Mountains&lt;/a&gt;. The Crown Prince &lt;a href=\"Juilek%20Cyrodiil\"&gt;Juilek Cyrodiil&lt;/a&gt; was the commander of the conflict in general, alongside the Akaviri Potentate, &lt;a href=\"Versidue%20Shaie\"&gt;Versidue Shaie&lt;/a&gt;. In the battle, Ulaqth was on the right flank, while the other notable figures were on the left. Despite the Emperor, &lt;a href=\"Reman%20III\"&gt;Reman III&lt;/a&gt;, having a disdain for beastfolk, Juilek's forces were able to defeat the Dark Elves, pushing them back into Morrowind, at the fortress of &lt;a href=\"Ald%20Marak\"&gt;Ald Marak&lt;/a&gt;. The conflict was over when the Empire was able to besiege Ald Marak, on account of shoddy espionage on the side of &lt;a href=\"Vivec\"&gt;Vivec&lt;/a&gt;. At that point, Morrowind was under the control of the Second Empire, but when the Empire would fall without heirs, this eighty-year long conflict had existed for nothing.\n&lt;a href=\"Second%20Era\"&gt;Second Era&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe Cyrodilic Collections &amp; the Remnant of Argon.\nDuring the &lt;a href=\"Interregnum\"&gt;Interregnum&lt;/a&gt; around &lt;a href=\"2E%20583\"&gt;2E 583&lt;/a&gt;, the city-state of Lilmoth was considered a part of the &lt;a href=\"Ebonheart%20Pact\"&gt;Ebonheart Pact&lt;/a&gt;, an alliance of the northeastern provinces with &lt;a href=\"Eastern%20Skyrim\"&gt;Eastern Skyrim&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Morrowind\"&gt;Morrowind&lt;/a&gt;. Lilmoth was ruled by a council of merchants that enforced order in their land, there was no central leader in Lilmoth, but many would respond to experienced folk like a retired &lt;a href=\"Shadowscale\"&gt;Shadowscale&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Sulahkeesh\"&gt;Sulahkeesh&lt;/a&gt;. Trade between the nearby &lt;a href=\"Bright-Throat%20Tribe\"&gt;Bright-Throat Tribe&lt;/a&gt; was steady. At this time, a group known as the &lt;a href=\"Cyrodilic%20Collections%20%28Faction%29\"&gt;Cyrodilic Collections&lt;/a&gt; had appeared in Lilmoth, bringing along various explorers from across the continent to part take in the archaeologist endeavors of &lt;a href=\"Famia%20Mercius\"&gt;Famia Mercius&lt;/a&gt;. An &lt;a href=\"Vestige\"&gt;adventurer&lt;/a&gt; was one of these explorers, partaking in a quest with Mercius' group to the ruin of the &lt;a href=\"Ixtaxh%20Xanmeer\"&gt;Ixtaxh Xanmeer&lt;/a&gt;, where they recovered the &lt;a href=\"Kajin-Jat%20Crystal\"&gt;Kajin-Jat Crystal&lt;/a&gt;. Ever since then, the Cyrodilic Collections had made their rounds throughout Murkmire, unfortunately getting involved with several indiscriminate groups such as the &lt;a href=\"Dragonstar%20Caravan%20Company\"&gt;Dragonstar Caravan Company&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Blackguards\"&gt;Blackguards&lt;/a&gt;, with the latter being the strongest criminal organization in Murkmire, ruling from the remains of &lt;a href=\"Blackrose%20Prison\"&gt;Blackrose Prison&lt;/a&gt;. But eventually, the Collections was able to recover the &lt;a href=\"Remnant%20of%20Argon\"&gt;Remnant of Argon&lt;/a&gt;, and restore the long forgotten &lt;a href=\"Root-Whisper%20Tribe\"&gt;Root-Whisper Tribe&lt;/a&gt;.\n&lt;a href=\"Third%20Era\"&gt;Third Era&lt;/a&gt;.\nQueen Hellena &amp; King Magnus Septim.\nIn &lt;a href=\"3E%20109\"&gt;3E 109&lt;/a&gt;, the city-state of Lilmoth was ruled by Queen &lt;a href=\"Hellena\"&gt;Hellena&lt;/a&gt;, who was of Imperial-descent. Before her rise to power, the Argonian Priest-King was executed, in favor of Hellena. She was said to represent Imperial rule very well, which would have likely resulted in her marriage with &lt;a href=\"Magnus%20Septim\"&gt;Magnus Septim&lt;/a&gt;, son of the former Emperor, &lt;a href=\"Pelagius%20Septim%20II\"&gt;Pelagius Septim II&lt;/a&gt;. Magnus was an exponential leader. This occurred sometime around the &lt;a href=\"War%20of%20the%20Isle\"&gt;War of the Isle&lt;/a&gt;, which took place on the other side of the continent. Magnus' rule of Lilmoth was prosperous, among his siblings, such as &lt;a href=\"Cephorus%20I\"&gt;Cephorus I&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"Gilane\"&gt;Gilane&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Potema\"&gt;Potema&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"Solitude\"&gt;Solitude&lt;/a&gt;. Hellena was a diplomat by nature, but because of her position in the backwaters of Lilmoth, she understood adversity and caution, and so both Magnus and Hellena were aware of Potema's wrath and ruthlessness, picking it up as far as &lt;a href=\"3E%20120\"&gt;3E 120&lt;/a&gt;, a year before the coronation of the Empress, &lt;a href=\"Kintyra%20Septim%20II\"&gt;Kintyra Septim II&lt;/a&gt;. On that year, Potema Septim had declared war against the Empire, known as the &lt;a href=\"War%20of%20the%20Red%20Diamond\"&gt;War of the Red Diamond&lt;/a&gt;. Magnus Septim and the Kingdom of Lilmoth were at the forefront against the North.\nThe War of the Red Diamond &amp; Battle of Falconstar.\nKing Magnus Septim and his Army of Argonian Brigadiers fought against Queen Potema of Solitude, and her allies she mustered throughout the years, consisting of nations such as &lt;a href=\"Ebonheart\"&gt;Ebonheart&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Glenpoint\"&gt;Glenpoint&lt;/a&gt;. Magnus' forces, stationed at the ruins of &lt;a href=\"Kogmenthist%20Castle\"&gt;Kogmenthist Castle&lt;/a&gt;, encountered Potema's warriors in what would become, the &lt;a href=\"Battle%20of%20Falconstar\"&gt;Battle of Falconstar&lt;/a&gt;. The battle commenced, sometime around the end of the &lt;a href=\"Battle%20of%20Ichidag\"&gt;Battle of Ichidag&lt;/a&gt;, where her only son, &lt;a href=\"Uriel%20Septim%20III\"&gt;Uriel Septim III&lt;/a&gt; was defeated by Cephorus, and sent to the city-state of Gilane, awaiting trial. The Battle against Magnus and Lilmoth's forces was over, and it ended in victory, in favor of Potema and her right-hand, &lt;a href=\"Lord%20Vhokken\"&gt;Lord Vhokken&lt;/a&gt;. By the time the Battle of Falconstar was over, it was revealed that Uriel III was killed in a riot and that Cephorus I was named the Emperor. Magnus' forces continued the fight, all the while into &lt;a href=\"3E%20137\"&gt;3E 137&lt;/a&gt; at the &lt;a href=\"Siege%20of%20Solitude\"&gt;Siege of Solitude&lt;/a&gt;. In &lt;a href=\"3E%20140\"&gt;3E 140&lt;/a&gt;, Cephorus I had passed away, and Magnus was named the Emperor. What happened to Lilmoth afterward is unknown.\nLilmoth during the Imperial Simulacrum.\nDuring the &lt;a href=\"Imperial%20Simulacrum\"&gt;Imperial Simulacrum&lt;/a&gt; from &lt;a href=\"3E%20389\"&gt;3E 389&lt;/a&gt; to &lt;a href=\"3E%20399\"&gt;3E 399&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Emperor\"&gt;Emperor&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Uriel%20Septim%20VII\"&gt;Uriel Septim VII&lt;/a&gt; was imprisoned along with &lt;a href=\"Talin%20Warhaft\"&gt;Talin Warhaft&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;a href=\"Deadlands\"&gt;Deadlands&lt;/a&gt; by &lt;a href=\"Jagar%20Tharn\"&gt;Jagar Tharn&lt;/a&gt;. Tharn planned for months to capture the throne, and he was able to achieve so in ten years. Tharn had a powerful weapon called the &lt;a href=\"Staff%20of%20Chaos\"&gt;Staff of Chaos&lt;/a&gt;, and he split it into nine pieces and scattered them across Tamriel, the staff was the only thing keeping Uriel Septim and Warhaft in &lt;a href=\"Oblivion\"&gt;Oblivion&lt;/a&gt;. A warrior escaped his clutches and traveled all corners of Tamriel to retrieve the missing pieces. The hero was known as the &lt;a href=\"Eternal%20Champion\"&gt;Eternal Champion&lt;/a&gt;, and he assembled the staff and defeated Jagar Tharn at the &lt;a href=\"Imperial%20Palace\"&gt;Imperial Palace&lt;/a&gt;. The Eternal Champion had at one point visited the city of Lilmoth in their quest to recover the pieces. The city of Lilmoth was under the rule of &lt;a href=\"Queen%20Artomeda\"&gt;Queen Artomeda&lt;/a&gt;.\n&lt;a href=\"Fourth%20Era\"&gt;Fourth Era&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe Slaughter of Lilmoth; The Umbriel Crisis.\nIn &lt;a href=\"4E%206\"&gt;4E 6&lt;/a&gt;, the Argonians of the &lt;a href=\"An-Xileel\"&gt;An-Xileel&lt;/a&gt; had risen into power, claiming the entire province of Black Marsh, under the banner of the An-Xileel. The city-state of Lilmoth was one of the cities that were brought into their control. Sometime later, the &lt;a href=\"Hist\"&gt;Hist&lt;/a&gt; of Lilmoth had gone awry, only talking to the An-Xileel and Argonians not considered \"\"Lukiul\",\" known in &lt;a href=\"Jel\"&gt;Jel&lt;/a&gt; as the Assimilated. All the while, strange reports had appeared on the Lilmoth Bay, of a floating island moving from the ocean, and towards the city-state of Lilmoth. This floating city was known as &lt;a href=\"Umbriel\"&gt;Umbriel&lt;/a&gt; and it first made their appearance known on the province of Black Marsh, beginning with Lilmoth and other nearby settlements. Sea creatures such as &lt;a href=\"Dreugh\"&gt;Dreugh&lt;/a&gt; emerged from the water, and even the Hist-controlled An-Xileel attacked the people, to which Umbriel would unleash moth-like creatures onto the land, enveloping dead bodies and turning them into undead creatures. Lilmoth was the first casualty in the &lt;a href=\"Umbriel%20Crisis\"&gt;Umbriel Crisis&lt;/a&gt;, which continued north into the &lt;a href=\"Imperial%20City\"&gt;Imperial City&lt;/a&gt;."}

Only a transpontine circumpenetration of the limen will result in transits of greater than infinitessimal duration.\nThough other hyperagonal media may exist in theory, the only known transliminal artifact capable of sustained transpontine circumpenetration is the &lt;a href=\"Sigil%20stone\"&gt;Sigil stone&lt;/a&gt;. A sigil stone is a specimen of pre-Mythic quasi-crystalline morpholith that has been transformed into an extra-dimensional artifact through the arcane inscription of a &lt;a href=\"daedric\"&gt;daedric&lt;/a&gt; sigil. Though some common morpholiths like soul gems may be found in nature, the exotic morpoliths used to make sigil stones occur only in pocket voids of &lt;a href=\"Oblivion%20%28Realm%29\"&gt;Oblivion&lt;/a&gt;, and cannot be prospected or harvested without daedric assistance.\nTherefore, since both the morpholiths and the daedric sigils required for hyperagonal media cannot be obtained without traffic and commerce with &lt;a href=\"Daedra%20Lords\"&gt;Daedra Lords&lt;/a&gt;, it is necessary that a transliminal mechanic cultivate a working knowledge of conjuration\u2014though purpose-built enchantments may be substituted if the mechanic has sufficient invocatory skill. Traffic and commerce with Daedra Lords is an esoteric but well-established practice, and lies outside the compass of this treatise. [1]\nPresuming a sigil stone has been acquired, the transliminal mechanic must first prepare the morpholith to receive the daedric sigil.\nLet the mechanic prepare a chamber, sealed against all daylight and disturbances of the outer air, roofed and walled with white stone and floored with black tiles. All surfaces of this chamber must be ritually purified with a solution of &lt;a href=\"void%20salts\"&gt;void salts&lt;/a&gt; in ether solvent.\nA foursquare table shall be placed in the center of the room, with a dish to receive the morpholith. Four censers shall be prepared with incense compounded from gorvix and harrada. On the equinox, the mechanic shall then place the morpolith in the dish and intone the rites of the Book of Law, beginning at dawn and continuing without cease until the sunset of the same day.\nThe mechanic may then present the purified morpholith to the Daedra Lord for his inscription. Once inscribed with the Daedra Lord's sigil, the morpholith becomes a true sigil stone, a powerful artifact that collects and stores arcane power\u2014similar in many respects to a charged soul gem, but of a much greater magnitude. And it is this sigil stone that is required to provide the tremendous arcane power necessary to sustain the enchantment that supports the transpontine circumpenetration of the limen.\nTo open a &lt;a href=\"Oblivion%20Gate\"&gt;gate to Oblivion&lt;/a&gt;, the mechanic must communicate directly, by spell or enchantment, with the Daedra Lord who inscribed the sigil stone in question. The Daedra Lord and the mechanic jointly invoke the conjurational charter [2], and the mechanic activates the charged sigil stone, which is immediately transported through the liminal barrier to the spot where its sigil was inscribed, thus opening a temporary portal between &lt;a href=\"Mundus\"&gt;Mundus&lt;/a&gt; and Oblivion. This portal may only remain open for a brief period of time, depending on the strength of the liminal barrier at the chosen spots, several minutes being the longest ever reported, so the usefulness of such a gate is quite limited.\n[1] Interested students are invited to consult the works of &lt;a href=\"Albrecht%20Theophannes%20Bombidius\"&gt;Albrecht Theophannes Bombidius&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Vanus%20Galerion\"&gt;Galerion The Mystic&lt;/a&gt; for the fundaments of this discipline.[2] Recommended examples of the conjurational charter may be found in &lt;a href=\"Therion\"&gt;Therion&lt;/a&gt;'s Book of Most Arcane Covenants or &lt;a href=\"Ralliballah\"&gt;Ralliballah&lt;/a&gt;'s Eleven Ritual Forms."}

My fame, or lack thereof, is irrelevant.\nI am not writer. As it so happens, my wife gave me this quill when I retired. She called it a gift. To me it is a burden, but I suppose many teachers feel this same weight. If I were to walk the bridge to Sovngarde, I would take all my knowledge with me. Hard lessons learned from decades fishing the waters of Skyrim.\nIn my life, I've fished in waters open and deep, amidst storms no mortal dare brook. I've ventured down bottomless caves, and challenged the monsters of the deep with my hook. I have seen them all, and caught them all, be it fish, monster, or boot.\nWith this guide, I will teach you how to do the same.\nChapter I:\nThe Rod\nJust as a warrior needs a sword and a blacksmith a hammer, the first thing any aspiring fisherman needs is a rod. You can find one at a general goods store, or left behind on boats and docks by other fisherman that have come before you. When you obtain one, wield it like you would a weapon, swinging it this way and that. Get a feel for its balance and weight. It must become an extension of your body and mind.\nChapter II:\nSupplies\nOnce you have a rod, you will next need supplies. This includes bait and other essentials to capture the fish once it's been reeled close to the shore.\nHowever, you need not bring your own. It is customary in Skyrim to leave fishing supplies by waters where the fish are plentiful. To find a set of fishing supplies is to be met with a greeting, a hearty hello from one fisherman to another.\nWhen you are done, you will leave these supplies for the next fisher. Such is the way.\nChapter III:\nCasting the Line\nWhen you are ready to fish, bait your hook using the fishing supplies. Then, cast your line with vigor and allow the hook to sink below the surface.\nThe art of fishing is one of patience and focus. In particular, it requires the concentration of two senses, sight and touch.\nYou might ask, how can one know if there are nearby fish for the taking? It is no different than the way moths are drawn to a flame. When your bait lands on the surface of the water, nearby fish will excitedly converge. The ripples on the surface will quickly announce their presence.\nWatch for these ripples carefully! The more the water stirs, the more plentiful the number of fish. In contrast, a quiet surface when your line hits the water will tell you there are no more fish to catch, and you must return in a day's time.\nIn time, you will learn to tell fish apart based on the tug on your line. You will know the difference between a river betty's curious nibble, and a carp's eager pull.\nChapter IV:\nReeling It In\nWhen you have hooked your fish, the time for patience and serenity is over. Now come the throes of war. Your fish will thrash as it fights for its life, but you must keep your grip firm and your mind focused, as you reel your line and pull in your catch.\nOnce you have reeled it in, the fish is yours. Scale it, cook it, and consume it how you please. Depending on your custom, there are different rituals to follow. But for all fisherman, a catch is always cause for celebration.\nChapter V:\nThe Rare and Unusual Catch\nDifferent fish are native to different climates. If you seek a variety of fish, do not stay in one place. Temperate lakes and streams to the south will hook you a different catch than snow fringed ponds and pitch black caverns.\nWhen you seek a fish that is seldom caught, the uncommon and rare fish that fisherman brag about until long in their years, your best bet is to fish when the sun is low on the horizon. Dawn and dusk offer the best chance to catch these elusive creatures.\nIf you seek the very rarest of fish, special rods are required. Seek the advice of those in the Riften Fishery. Follow their guidance and wisdom, just as you have done with me.\nOf course, not every catch will feed your belly. Some may fill your coin purse, while others have interesting uses to those who brew potions.\nIn my travels, I have even heard tall tales of Dwarven rods used to lure lost trinkets settled at the bottom of ponds and lakes. For what purpose, a Nord like myself cannot know. As the world moves on, such things are lost to time.\nChapter VI:\nIn Conclusion\nThere you have it. As I stated at the beginning of this journey, I am no writer. What is written here are not words, but a piece of me.\nIt is the callow boy who in his arrogance was nearly dragged into the water by a goldfish.\nIt is the shivering fishmonger, sitting on a frozen bucket in the dead of night praying to Kyne that he will live to see the sunrise.\nIt is the old man at the lake drinking a potion of strength, turning back time so he can hook an old foe.\nIt is part of me, and if you heed its message, it will become part of you."}

She wants me to capture a living Werewolf for the ritual she needs to perform.\"\nWalkthrough.\nThe Duke says Gloria has discovered something important about how &lt;a href=\"Faolchu\"&gt;Faolchu&lt;/a&gt; came to power. He was summoned back from the dead and to learn more she needs a live werewolf. Talk to Sergeant Armoil Viranes, he knows how as they faced werewolves in &lt;a href=\"Camlorn%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Camlorn&lt;/a&gt; and they captured one. Then meet Gloria in the cave to the east, across the bay. That's where she'll perform the rite to learn how to defeat Faolchu.\nBefore leaving the hideout, speak to Gloria. She has more information about the ritual, then head to the sergeant at the &lt;a href=\"Lion%20Guard\"&gt;Lion Guard&lt;/a&gt; camp in town. He'll assign &lt;a href=\"Battlemage%20Lexi\"&gt;Battlemage Lexi&lt;/a&gt; to help capture the werewolf. Head outside &lt;a href=\"Aldcroft\"&gt;Aldcroft&lt;/a&gt; and follow the marker to find werewolves. Fight werewolves to weaken them so Lexi can trap one.\nHead over to the cave and enter. Continue inside with the werewolf and find Gloria. She'll create a link between the three of them, and hopefully see the werewolf's past as well as Faolchu's past. The connection between offspring and sire is strong. During the ritual a vision appear, listen to the conversation until the end. Then speak to Gloria. It turns out the ritual revealed &lt;a href=\"Angof%20the%20Gravesinger%20%28Character%29\"&gt;Angof's&lt;/a&gt; role in Faolchu's return from the dead.

He will destroy everything he loves. You have failed! Angof has sealed your fate.\"\nWe're wasting time she says, it's time for her to die as she is a descendent to Faolchu. If the Duke drinks her blood he'll be cured. The &lt;a href=\"Vestige\"&gt;Vestige&lt;/a&gt; now has a choice, either to agree with Gloria or tell her she is needed alive. If the latter was chosen, she'll go back to Aldcroft and wait there.\nHead back to town to speak to the Duke before he transforms into a werewolf. He's sorry as he should have told them about him being a werewolf. He asks for one favor and that is to talk to his family and then the Vestige can do what they must. Here is another choice, either let him meet the family or say no and add that he wont be killed. If the latter is chosen, tell him they will continue to look for a cure.\u00a0\nTalk to Gloria after she has captured the Duke, if this was chosen and she is surprised. Tell her Camlorn needs the Duke, that's why he was spared and receive the &lt;a href=\"Werewolf%20Slayer\"&gt;Werewolf Slayer&lt;/a&gt; and some for doing the job.\nIf the first choice is taken, the Duke becomes a werewolf inside the house and kills his wife and daughter before attacking the Vestige, who has to kill him now."}

The Listener's role is to visit the &lt;a href=\"Night%20Mother\"&gt;Night Mother&lt;/a&gt; to receive contracts made by those who have performed the &lt;a href=\"Black%20Sacrament\"&gt;Black Sacrament&lt;/a&gt;. Once the Listener has heard the words of the Night Mother, they disseminate the contracts to the Speakers who, in turn, pass the contracts to Brotherhood sanctuaries, to their &lt;a href=\"Silencer\"&gt;Silencer&lt;/a&gt;, or meet with the invoker themselves. Listeners are treated with great respect and deference by other members of the Brotherhood, including members of the Black Hand.\nThe Night Mother chooses who is worthy to be named a Listener by first telepathically communicating with them and revealing to them a phrase known as the Binding Words as recorded in the Keeping Tomes, that is \"Darkness rises when silence dies.\" It must then be spoken to the Keeper of the Night Mother to confirm their new position; the Binding Words are kept a closely guarded secret between Keepers to ensure that only a true Listener is chosen.\nNotable Listeners.\n&lt;a href=\"Ungolim\"&gt;Ungolim&lt;/a&gt;.\nUngolim was a &lt;a href=\"Bosmer\"&gt;Bosmer&lt;/a&gt; Listener during and prior to &lt;a href=\"3E%20433\"&gt;3E 433&lt;/a&gt; before he was killed by the &lt;a href=\"Hero%20of%20Kvatch\"&gt;Hero of Kvatch&lt;/a&gt; operating as Speaker &lt;a href=\"Lucien%20Lachance\"&gt;Lucien Lachance&lt;/a&gt;'s Silencer. For some time, Speaker &lt;a href=\"Mathieu%20Bellamont\"&gt;Mathieu Bellamont&lt;/a&gt; had been secretly swapping out Lechance's orders to the Hero and replacing them with orders to kill members of the Black Hand in revenge for the death of his mother. The Hero killed Ungolim before Lechance was able to intervene.\n&lt;a href=\"Hero%20of%20Kvatch\"&gt;The Hero of Kvatch&lt;/a&gt;.\nAfter the death of Ungolim in 4E 433, the Hero of Kvatch took up the position of Listner after communicating with the Night Mother and thwarting Mathieu Bellamont's plot to destroy the her and the Black Hand. With the &lt;a href=\"Cheydinhal%20Sanctuary\"&gt;Cheydinhal Sanctuary&lt;/a&gt; purged and all but one other member of the Black Hand alive, the Hero became responsible for rebuilding the Brotherhood in &lt;a href=\"Cyrodiil\"&gt;Cyrodiil&lt;/a&gt;.\n&lt;a href=\"Alisanne%20Dupre\"&gt;Alisanne Dupre&lt;/a&gt;.\nAlisanne Dupre was a &lt;a href=\"Breton\"&gt;Breton&lt;/a&gt; Listener from &lt;a href=\"4E%20187\"&gt;4E 187&lt;/a&gt; or earlier until her death in &lt;a href=\"4E%20188\"&gt;4E 188&lt;/a&gt;. Her father, &lt;a href=\"Uther%20Nere\"&gt;Uther Nere&lt;/a&gt;, orchestrated a plot to destroy the Dark Brotherhood after Dupre killed her own mother, Nere's wife. Nere was killed by her father while protecting the Night Mother's corpse after gang riots desecrated the &lt;a href=\"Lucky%20Old%20Lady\"&gt;Lucky Old Lady&lt;/a&gt; statue in &lt;a href=\"Bravil\"&gt;Bravil&lt;/a&gt;.\n&lt;a href=\"Last%20Dragonborn\"&gt;The Last Dragonborn&lt;/a&gt;.\nIn &lt;a href=\"4E%20201\"&gt;4E 201&lt;/a&gt;, if the Last Dragonborn chose to join the Dark Brotherhood rather than destroy it, they eventually become the Listener after communicating with the Night Mother despite her long silence to fulfil contracts and rebuild the Brotherhood's presence in Skyrim. The Dragonborn then goes on to assassinate &lt;a href=\"Emperor\"&gt;Emperor&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Titus%20Mede%20II\"&gt;Titus Mede II&lt;/a&gt; and relocate the Brotherhood to the &lt;a href=\"Dawnstar%20Sanctuary\"&gt;Dawnstar Sanctuary&lt;/a&gt; following the destruction of the &lt;a href=\"Falkreath%20Sanctuary\"&gt;Falkreath Sanctuary&lt;/a&gt; by the &lt;a href=\"Penitus%20Oculatus\"&gt;Penitus Oculatus&lt;/a&gt;. Alternatively, the Last Dragonborn may have killed &lt;a href=\"Astrid\"&gt;Astrid&lt;/a&gt;, the leader of the Brotherhood in Skyrim, followed by most of the other members on behalf of the Penitus Oculatus.\nFalse Listeners.\nThe act of falsely claiming to hear the Night Mother's words is punishable by death within Brotherhood. In &lt;a href=\"4E%20189\"&gt;4E 189&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Rasha%20%28Lore%29\"&gt;Rasha&lt;/a&gt;, a Speaker serving as interim leader in the Cheydinhal Sanctuary, claimed to hear the Night Mother speak to him following the death of the previous Listener, Alisanne Dupre, but when he failed to recite the Binding Words to Cicero, the Keeper subsequently ordered a Brotherhood assassin, &lt;a href=\"Garnag\"&gt;Garnag&lt;/a&gt;, to kill him."}

In the inky blackness, the familiar aquamarine glow of the &lt;a href=\"Welkynd%20Stone%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;Welkynd Stones&lt;/a&gt; beckoned me in silent reverence. I was the first here in ages; evidenced by the thick layers of dust and debris strewn about. I don't remember how long I stood there, in awe of the beautiful crystals outside their natural environment.\nThey all said I was crazy; a fool, a buffoon. Crystals growing outside &lt;a href=\"Ayleid%20Ruins%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;Ayleid ruins&lt;/a&gt;? Preposterous! I spent nearly a decade and all the money I had crossing &lt;a href=\"Cyrodiil\"&gt;Cyrodiil&lt;/a&gt; and exploring the many natural caves dotting her landscape. Then, on that fateful night, an &lt;a href=\"Orsimer%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;Orc&lt;/a&gt; stumbled into the &lt;a href=\"Imperial%20Bridge%20Inn\"&gt;Imperial Bridge Inn&lt;/a&gt; where I happened to be drinking. He spouted off a line of nonsense about creatures that came out of the darkness, and I dismissed him as drunk, until he said something that gripped my heart with hope. He spoke of a light in the darkness \"as blue as the lady sea.\" Could it be the Welkynd Stones I was seeking? I had to know more. A few &lt;a href=\"Septim%20%28Coin%29\"&gt;gold&lt;/a&gt; and many drinks later, the Orc told me he'd been in &lt;a href=\"Bramblepoint%20Cave\"&gt;Bramblepoint Cave&lt;/a&gt;. As I made my way through the night to the cave, my mind was racing. The stories had to be true! The &lt;a href=\"Ayleid\"&gt;Ayleid&lt;/a&gt; culture had mastered the art of creating these crystalline structures and was just beginning to cultivate them outside of their underground communities when they disappeared from history. That meant one thing; with the proper materials, magic and research the Welkynd Stone could adapt to any environment. I had to get to Bramblepoint and study them before anyone else found them. This would be my mark on history, my moment to shine.\nAnd now, after climbing through the cave I've arrived at this chamber. After I finish this entry in my logbook, I'll have so much to do. So much to do indeed. This will be the day that Lithnilian will be remembered as the first to unlock the secrets of the Welkynd Stone.\"\""}

Sometimes these dancers seep up through the cracks in &lt;a href=\"Nirni\"&gt;Nirni&lt;/a&gt; to the moonlit world, and walk among us as if made of moonless night. Then we call them dro-m'Athra. And this is a name of fear.\nFor a true cat to see a dro-m'Athra do the Bent Dance is to feel his tail twitch in time, and feel the pull of the Darks. As each twitch pulls the true cat further from the moons-light, the cat's shadow grows longer and more bent. And if the tide of the Darks grows greater than the tide of the Lights, the true cat is lost, and becomes a bent cat.\nThen comes the true peril, for a dro-m'Athra can twist out a bent cat's soul, and send it through the cracks to the Darks. Once it hears the beating of the Heart it, too, will dance bent.\nIt is hard to stop. One night all the villagers of Lohrn were found dancing the Bent Dance. Now we do not go there.\nWANE:\nTo banish the dro-m'Athra, there are two ways: the Way of Jone and the Way of Jode.\nWarriors use the Way of &lt;a href=\"Jone\"&gt;Jone&lt;/a&gt;, which is to unsheathe the claws and strike the darkness until it is no more. And this way is a good way, for everyone who is strong of heart and claw can use it.\nPriests use the Way of &lt;a href=\"Jode\"&gt;Jode&lt;/a&gt;, which is to bathe the moonless dark in bright lunar light. And this way is a better way, for bent spirits thus banished do not return."}

They exist in several varieties and can be found throughout &lt;a href=\"Skyrim\"&gt;Skyrim&lt;/a&gt;'s wilderness, as well as inside &lt;a href=\"dungeons\"&gt;dungeons&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Mines%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;mines&lt;/a&gt; (such as &lt;a href=\"Redbelly%20Mine\"&gt;Redbelly Mine&lt;/a&gt;). They are also one of many &lt;a href=\"insects\"&gt;arthropods&lt;/a&gt; found living in &lt;a href=\"Skyrim\"&gt;Skyrim&lt;/a&gt;. Frostbite Spiders are always aggressive and will attack almost anything on sight, with the exception of &lt;a href=\"Lis\"&gt;Lis&lt;/a&gt;.\nThey will spit poisonous &lt;a href=\"Frostbite%20Venom\"&gt;venom&lt;/a&gt; from afar during combat, which can be harvested and used on weapons after they are killed. Upon attacking, they will make a screeching or scuttling noise. They attack with their mandibles and legs when up close. In addition to their normal melee attacks, all Frostbite Spiders possess a dangerous leaping attack that they may use to initiate combat, which can easily kill an unsuspecting victim due to its long range and high damage. All of their attacks apply poison damage as well. Frostbite Spiders' health and strength depends on the size of the spider, though the white variants encountered in colder regions of Skyrim have higher health compared to their more temperate, red relatives. Their lairs are often strewn with webs which they can use to descend upon their unwary prey from above. Some of the egg sacs located within the lairs of Frostbite Spiders contain &lt;a href=\"Spider%20Egg%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Spider Eggs&lt;/a&gt;, which are an ingredient used in &lt;a href=\"Alchemy%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;alchemy&lt;/a&gt;.\nDungeons containing Frostbite Spiders often have webbing around their entrances. Inside, webs frequently contain the desiccated corpses of creatures and adventurers. These webs may also hide &lt;a href=\"Containers%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;chests&lt;/a&gt;, urns, or passages. While some can simply be walked through, others must be cut or burned away in order to proceed. While they are usually the sole inhabitants of their residences, Frostbite Spiders will occasionally share an abode with &lt;a href=\"vampire%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Vampires&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Falmer%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Falmer&lt;/a&gt;, or other creatures, whom they are friendly with.\nTypes.\nFrostbite Spider.\nFour sub-types of standard Frostbite Spiders exist, each with different amounts of &lt;a href=\"Health%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;health&lt;/a&gt;. They stand roughly as tall as a &lt;a href=\"Wolf%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;wolf&lt;/a&gt;, and commonly appear in small groups.\nWounded Frostbite Spider.\nA single wounded Frostbite Spider appears in &lt;a href=\"Bleak%20Falls%20Barrow%20%28Location%29\"&gt;Bleak Falls Barrow&lt;/a&gt;. Its size and abilities are both slightly less than those of Giant Frostbite Spiders. Another one may be found in &lt;a href=\"Ysgramor%27s%20Tomb\"&gt;Ysgramor's Tomb&lt;/a&gt;, along with one in &lt;a href=\"Dimhollow%20Crypt\"&gt;Dimhollow Crypt&lt;/a&gt; once is installed. Although rare, they may appear when fast traveling to &lt;a href=\"Riverwood%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Riverwood&lt;/a&gt;.\nGiant Frostbite Spider.\nGiant Frostbite Spiders are a considerably larger, more fearsome type of Frostbite Spider. Standing slightly taller than the &lt;a href=\"Last%20Dragonborn\"&gt;Dragonborn&lt;/a&gt;, they are most commonly found in caves. While Giant Frostbite Spiders do not live together, they are often accompanied by several minor Frostbite Spiders. When the Dragonborn reaches higher levels (around level 40), they become more common inside dungeons, especially those occupied by &lt;a href=\"Witch%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;witches&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Hagraven%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;hagravens&lt;/a&gt;, and it is not impossible to find two in the same room. At higher levels (mostly above 80), they are frequently found in the wild. Ironically, however, they do not become more common inside spider nests at higher levels. The may also be found as a random encounter in the wild, where two of them are fighting each other. Two sub-types exist, with differing amounts of health.\n&lt;a href=\"Lis\"&gt;Lis&lt;/a&gt;.\nLis is a somewhat domesticated spider kept by &lt;a href=\"Gabriella\"&gt;Gabriella&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;a href=\"Dark%20Brotherhood%20Sanctuary%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Dark Brotherhood Sanctuary&lt;/a&gt;. She is friendly and will not attack &lt;a href=\"Dark%20Brotherhood%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Dark Brotherhood&lt;/a&gt; members unless provoked, or if the Dragonborn chooses to destroy the Dark Brotherhood. If Lis is killed or attacked in any way by the Dragonborn, it counts as attacking a Dark Brotherhood member and the Dragonborn must pay a fine.\n&lt;a href=\"Nimhe\"&gt;Nimhe&lt;/a&gt;.\n&lt;a href=\"Nimhe\"&gt;Nimhe&lt;/a&gt;, \"The Poisoned One,\" is a unique named spider that inhabits the &lt;a href=\"Nchuand-Zel%20Excavation%20Site\"&gt;Nchuand-Zel Excavation Site&lt;/a&gt; beneath &lt;a href=\"Markarth%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Markarth's&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Understone%20Keep%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Understone Keep&lt;/a&gt;."}

Or &lt;a href=\"Molag%20Bal%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Molag Bal&lt;/a&gt;? Or &lt;a href=\"Mephala%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Mephala&lt;/a&gt;? The wicked schemers and liars! How could this happen?\nLady of Light, I've chastened my hands for their mad scratchings in my grief. Forgive your flawed servant for her impertinence. Know that I am ever faithful. Your will is my will and your workings are not for me to know.\nNew word has come. The Men spill out of the Temple of Ancestors in a ravenous stampede, still thirsty for our blood. They are the wretched horde of &lt;a href=\"Namira\"&gt;Namira&lt;/a&gt; unleashed to devour us. Several of our sister kingdoms have already fallen to their advance, others have thrown in their lot with the rebels. Cowards and opportunists. I'd sooner make a pact with &lt;a href=\"Clavicus%20Vile%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Vile&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe other kingdoms are drowning. Thrashing around in desperation. &lt;a href=\"Narilmor\"&gt;Narilmor&lt;/a&gt; tells me there is a desperate plot to find the Wrathstone, as if there was some singular thing with the power to turn the tide of this war. Our forces should stand united against the Men, not search for fables!\nThe others will not listen. They will not assemble against the Men as they should. Already a unit marches northeast to besiege the &lt;a href=\"Dwemer\"&gt;Dwemer&lt;/a&gt; city. There is no proof that they even have the Wrathstone. Don't we have enemies enough?\nOur Lady spoke to us. Only once before has she graced us with her attention. Upon our coronation. She brought us dire news: our empire will crumble. This beautiful kingdom we have preserved for her will become our grave. All is not lost, though. Because we are loyal\u2014because we are pure\u2014she entrusted us with a great secret. She has given us a piece of the Wrathstone to keep safe. It will be buried here with us, kept here in secret, until she comes to reclaim it. Bright Lady, we will prove worthy of the gifts you've given us and this sacred charge. We will watch over it always.\nI do not doubt our Lady's purpose, not for one moment, but that does not dull the pain of watching our neighboring kingdoms cling to a desperate hope that we know is vain. We cannot tell them that they will never have the Wrathstone, only watch as they claw at every nook and cranny looking for salvation. Poor fools. It's not meant for you. Just flee.\nThe rebels have finally reached our walls. The fortress above is soon to fall. The vaults of our city already crack and crumble under the hammering siege above our heads. I see the terror in my people's eyes and it breaks my heart that I can offer them no solace. Your sacrifice will not be forgotten. Our Lady has made certain that we'll carry your memory through the ages.\nMen will not set foot in Garlas Malatar. It is our tomb now, and the time to seal it is nigh."}

The Spire had been left alone for many years and has remained intact ever since its inception.\nHistory.\n&lt;a href=\"Third%20Era\"&gt;Third Era&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe Frostcrag Spire was built in the last year of the third era, in &lt;a href=\"3E%20433\"&gt;3E 433&lt;/a&gt; by &lt;a href=\"Taris%20Rendil\"&gt;Taris Rendil&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"Arch-Mage\"&gt;Arch-Mage&lt;/a&gt; of the &lt;a href=\"Arcane%20University\"&gt;Arcane University&lt;/a&gt; of the &lt;a href=\"Imperial%20City%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;Imperial City&lt;/a&gt;. Rendil was proficient in the arcane arts, having interest in both &lt;a href=\"Enchanting\"&gt;Enchanting&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Spellcrafting\"&gt;Spellcrafting&lt;/a&gt;, both had a deteriorating health. Sketching for days, Rendil designed and created the Frostcrag Spire, with all sorts of magical anomalies surrounding it. With the help of &lt;a href=\"Sinderion\"&gt;Sinderion&lt;/a&gt;, an &lt;a href=\"Altmer\"&gt;Altmer&lt;/a&gt; with a passion for the &lt;a href=\"Nirnroot\"&gt;Nirnroot&lt;/a&gt;, created the Frostcrag Apparatus, which was an &lt;a href=\"Alchemy\"&gt;Alchemy&lt;/a&gt; table that could create even the most complicated concoctions. When Rendil passed away, he sent the deed to a long-lost relative, who was an &lt;a href=\"Hero%20of%20Kvatch\"&gt;estranged warrior&lt;/a&gt; during the &lt;a href=\"Oblivion%20Crisis\"&gt;Oblivion Crisis&lt;/a&gt;. The warrior inhabited the Frostcrag Spire for quite some time. It is unknown whether that warrior still lives there or not, and if their relative inhabited the structure."}

Although it seems like yesterday, it was actually many years ago. I was an impetuous wizard; I wasn't simply satisfied living at the &lt;a href=\"Arcane%20University%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;Arcane University&lt;/a&gt;. I spent years coming up with a design for my home, a place where I could practice my magic in peace and keep myself away from the prying eyes of my colleagues. I pored over tomes and dusty scrolls, scoured the bookshops of the land and even delved into ancient ruins looking for inspiration. Finally, as I rested my weary body at a camp outside of &lt;a href=\"Bruma%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;Bruma&lt;/a&gt; and marveled in awe at the majesty of the &lt;a href=\"Jerall%20Mountains\"&gt;Jerall Mountains&lt;/a&gt;, I became inspired. Like a madman I begin to sketch exactly what I wanted my grand dwelling to look like. It wasn't long before I had completed my masterpiece, put down my quill and took a step back to see what I had wrought. Frostcrag Spire was born.\nAnd now, as age overwhelms me and the glow is dying from my eyes, I wish to give the &lt;a href=\"Frostcrag%20Spire%20%28Location%29\"&gt;Spire&lt;/a&gt; to you. The thought that my dream could one day crumble to ruin fills me with sadness. I know that you'll take care of your new home, and if need be, restore it to its former glory. Please, heed my instructions carefully. There's much to tell, and the strength drains from my limbs.\nFrostcrag Spire contains many wonderful inventions. I've spent my whole life perfecting them, and I hope you'll put them to good use. My pride and joy is the &lt;a href=\"Atronach%20Altar\"&gt;Atronach Altar&lt;/a&gt;. By bringing three salts from the very same creatures to this altar, you can summon an &lt;a href=\"Atronach\"&gt;Atronach&lt;/a&gt; familiar to do your bidding. It will obey your simple commands, and defend you in times of need. Should you tire of it, simply speak to it and dismiss it. These fine creatures have protected me in my travels, and should be of great use to you.\nWith permission from the &lt;a href=\"Arcane%20University%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;Arcane University&lt;/a&gt;, I've had a &lt;a href=\"Spellmaking%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;Spellmaking&lt;/a&gt; and an &lt;a href=\"Enchanting%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;enchanting&lt;/a&gt; altar placed in the tower as well. You have but to provide the &lt;a href=\"Magetallow%20Candles\"&gt;Magetallow Candles&lt;/a&gt; to power them, and they will serve you well.\nWorking closely with my good friend &lt;a href=\"Sinderion\"&gt;Sinderion&lt;/a&gt;, the Master Alchemist of &lt;a href=\"Skingrad%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;Skingrad&lt;/a&gt;, I have developed the &lt;a href=\"Frostcrag%20Apparatus%20Table\"&gt;Frostcrag Apparatus Table&lt;/a&gt;. This table is for the discerning alchemist, and should help even the most difficult brews become easier to create. I've also re-seeded my alchemy conservatory with the best ingredients &lt;a href=\"Cyrodiil\"&gt;Cyrodiil&lt;/a&gt; has to offer, and some from beyond her borders.\nFinally, I have created portals to all of the mage's guilds in Cyrodiil. This should make it easier to travel to them in times of need. I've entrusted most of my belongings to &lt;a href=\"Aurelinwae\"&gt;Aurelinwae&lt;/a&gt; at the &lt;a href=\"Mystic%20Emporium\"&gt;Mystic Emporium&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;a href=\"Market%20District\"&gt;Market District&lt;/a&gt; of the &lt;a href=\"Imperial%20City%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;Imperial City&lt;/a&gt;. There you'll find everything you need to bring Frostcrag Spire back from the dead. She may require compensation for her time and care watching these special items, but I assure you, it's well worth the coin. Please, take care of Frostcrag Spire. She was my home and much of myself is infused with the stone and mortar. May your journeys be safe, and the roads you travel free of danger."}

The coup resulted in the deaths of the king and queen, as well as all but one of their children, and the accession of Tharn as Queen of Rimmen.\nBackground.\nEuraxia Tharn was sent to Rimmen as part of a diplomatic mission to Elsweyr by &lt;a href=\"Emperor%20Leovic\"&gt;Emperor Leovic&lt;/a&gt;, and, at the same time, the recent legalization of &lt;a href=\"Daedra\"&gt;Daedra&lt;/a&gt; worship had resulted in the rebellion of the &lt;a href=\"Colovian%20Estates\"&gt;Colovian Estates&lt;/a&gt; led by &lt;a href=\"Varen%20Aquilarios\"&gt;Varen Aquilarios&lt;/a&gt;. In the confusion of the new conflict, Tharn hired a large army of Nibenese mercenaries and marched them into Rimmen. Because the city was a part of the Empire, King Hemakar welcomed Tharn and her army as representatives of the Empire. Tharn proceeded to assassinate the members of the royal family and declared herself Queen of Rimmen.\nAftermath.\nFollowing the death of all of the members of Rimmen's royal family, except one, Tharn declared herself to be Queen of Rimmen and used her mercenaries, whom she referred to as the &lt;a href=\"Euraxian%20Legion\"&gt;Euraxian Legion&lt;/a&gt;, to enforce her rule across the region of &lt;a href=\"Northern%20Elsweyr\"&gt;Northern Elsweyr&lt;/a&gt;. Stationed in Northern Elsweyr near Rimmen were a legion of &lt;a href=\"Imperials%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Imperials&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"Cygnus%20Irregulars\"&gt;Cygnus Irregulars&lt;/a&gt;, who ostensibly provided support to Euraxia's regime, but were, in fact, supportive of the growing efforts of the local militia to depose her.\nSome time after the coup, the &lt;a href=\"Elsweyr%20Defense%20Force\"&gt;Elsweyr Defense Force&lt;/a&gt; was formed under the leadership of &lt;a href=\"Lord%20Gharesh-ri\"&gt;Lord Gharesh-ri&lt;/a&gt;, speaker of the &lt;a href=\"Mane\"&gt;Mane&lt;/a&gt; with the support of the &lt;a href=\"Aldmeri%20Dominion%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Aldmeri Dominion&lt;/a&gt;. The Defense Force intended to depose Tharn and restore the region to &lt;a href=\"Khajiit%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Khajiit&lt;/a&gt; rule. As a result of the outbreak of the &lt;a href=\"Alliance%20War\"&gt;Alliance War&lt;/a&gt;, however, the Dominion was unable to provide the Defense Force with material support.\nIn &lt;a href=\"2E%20582\"&gt;2E 582&lt;/a&gt;, Tharn would be killed by the &lt;a href=\"Vestige\"&gt;Vestige&lt;/a&gt;, her half-brother &lt;a href=\"Abnur%20Tharn\"&gt;Abnur Tharn&lt;/a&gt;, and the last surviving member of the royal family, &lt;a href=\"Khamira\"&gt;Khamira&lt;/a&gt;. Following Euraxia's death and the retreat of the Euraxian Legion, Khamira became Queen of Rimmen, restoring the line of &lt;a href=\"Anequina%20Sharp-Tongue\"&gt;Anequina Sharp-Tongue&lt;/a&gt;."}

Entering the basement without entering that room first can bug the quest, see bug section. Due to the presence of powerful enemies such as &lt;a href=\"Falmer%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;falmer&lt;/a&gt; and a &lt;a href=\"Chaurus%20Reaper%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;chaurus reaper&lt;/a&gt;, low-leveled players will experience difficulty undertaking this quest.

Upon entry, the lighthouse interior is in disarray, and several grisly murders having been committed. The &lt;a href=\"Last%20Dragonborn\"&gt;Dragonborn&lt;/a&gt; is given the task of finding the source of the murders, and upon reading the journals found in Frostflow Lighthouse, the Dragonborn will find clues as to what has happened and how to proceed.

Kill any chaurus in the cellar, and go to the opening in the far wall.\nFinding the Lighthouse occupants.\nGo through the opening, and enter the Frostflow Abyss and deal with the falmer and chaurus in the first room. After dispatching them, look around and find &lt;a href=\"Mani%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Mani&lt;/a&gt;'s remains.\nLocate the next passageway, and head deeper into the abyss. The next chamber has falmer dwellings and a fenced-in area where &lt;a href=\"Sudi\"&gt;Sudi&lt;/a&gt;'s body lies, along with the &lt;a href=\"Scrawled%20page\"&gt;Scrawled page&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Bloodstained%20note%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Bloodstained note&lt;/a&gt;. There will also be falmer and chaurus.\nContinue exploring, dealing with the chaurus as preferred (killing or sneaking past them) until the Dragonborn arrives at a hole in the floor where the only way to proceed is to jump down onto a ledge. Do so, and kill the chaurus that are in the area. Harvest &lt;a href=\"chaurus%20eggs\"&gt;chaurus eggs&lt;/a&gt; if desired (there are several hundred available here, as the area is a chaurus nest), and continue to explore, dealing with more chaurus along the way. Next will be a large cavern with stalactites, several chaurus, and a chaurus reaper. The chaurus reaper must be killed before one can exit the abyss, and can be difficult for lower-leveled players, and is guarded by at least one chaurus. When killed, the chaurus reaper will have Habd's remains (necessary to gain the power &lt;a href=\"Sailor%27s%20Repose\"&gt;Sailor's Repose&lt;/a&gt;), as well as Habd's lighthouse key.\nHabd's last request.\nWith Habd's remains in hand, continue forward to a trail that leads up along a ledge that leads back to the opening of the abyss. There is a falmer chest on the pathway. At what looks like the end of the path, jump down to end up in the first room entered when exploring the abyss.\nReturn to the lighthouse cellar, go upstairs (watch out for the bear trap, as it is now reset), and pick the lock on the other wooden door, which leads to the top of the lighthouse. There, climb the ladder that leads to the pot of fire, and activate it. The activation of the lighthouse torch will remove Habd's remains from the inventory and give the Dragonborn the active effect: &lt;a href=\"Sailor%27s%20Repose\"&gt;Sailor's Repose&lt;/a&gt;\u00a0(Healing spells cure 10% more). Habd's lighthouse key is needed to open the chest that is on the roof of the lighthouse, and once this last task is undertaken the quest is complete."}

Within the latter is a &lt;a href=\"Word%20Walls%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;word wall&lt;/a&gt; for the &lt;a href=\"dragon%20shout\"&gt;dragon shout&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Ice%20Form\"&gt;Ice Form&lt;/a&gt;.\nInterior.\nAlthough generally styled as a Nordic tomb, the place is inhabited by a group of &lt;a href=\"Bandits%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;bandits&lt;/a&gt;, who live in the Frostmere Crypt area. Because of their presence, there are numerous bed rolls and dressers scattered about the area.\nAlong side several, more obvious, chests (with various lock strengths) that are scattered around the crypt, there are two hidden chests. One, master-locked and located in Frostmere Depths, can be found by heading left just before the altar and following the path around. The second (adept-locked) can be found in the submerged room after exiting Frostmere Depths. It is located at the bottom of the room, next to a table which has a leveled weapon on it (there is also a piece of leveled armor within this room).\nThe crypt itself is fairly straightforward to navigate and contains only a couple of traps. Most notably, there is an arrow trap in the hallway leading to the submerged room. The only enemies encountered within the dungeon are leveled bandits and the &lt;a href=\"The%20Pale%20Lady%20%28Creature%29\"&gt;Pale Lady&lt;/a&gt;.\nFrostmere Depths also contains two end-of-dungeon chests. One is located by the exit; the other can be found by turning left at the sword stand, walking across the water and up the hill. When farthest west, walk north about the same distance. To the right of the chest sits a pillar supporting the ceiling which makes it impossible to see when standing at the sword stand, although this serves as a marker if lost.\nThere is also a dead skeleton lying against a tree with a battleaxe and a shield. To find it, walk from the entrance toward the sword stand and turn left when you see an uprooted tree stump on your left. Continue west, walking under the fallen log and straight ahead is the tree where the skeleton sits under.\nTrivia.\nBandit 1 \"But...&lt;a href=\"Eisa\"&gt;Eisa&lt;/a&gt;?

At the outbreak of the Great War, the Blades were hunted down by the &lt;a href=\"Thalmor\"&gt;Thalmor&lt;/a&gt; to near extinction and later disbanded.

There are bright bloodstains on it, as well as a fresh mark. It indicates a cave entrance along the ridge line.&gt;\"\nThe papers will contain a map pointing to a small cave in the southeast of Ouze. You will find a pair of spinners outside the cave; talk to Spinner Endrith and she will tell you that the cultists are inside trying to use Indinael's body to create a giant undead monster, but that the totem of Y'ffre might be able to break their hold over the creature. \nHead into the cave. If you intimidated Celonron, he will send a spectral tiger to help you. Either way, fight your way through the cave. In the western passageway, around where it bends south, you will find the lorebook \"&lt;a href=\"Green%20Lady%2C%20My%20Lady\"&gt;Green Lady, My Lady&lt;/a&gt;\", so be sure to pick that up. At the end of the cave, you will find that Indinael has been transformed into a giant monster; kill it, then head out of the cave. You can use the totem of Y'ffre to weaken her bonds, making her easier to kill. Once the creature is destroyed, talk to Indinael outside the cave. She will ask you to return the totem to Spinner Gwilon; doing so will finish the quest."}

It details the fundamentals of the craft of &lt;a href=\"Alchemy\"&gt;Alchemy&lt;/a&gt;, as the title suggests. Relatively inexpensive, all the &lt;a href=\"Mages%20Guild%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;Mages Guild halls&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Cyrodiil\"&gt;Cyrodiil&lt;/a&gt; carry many copies. Bookstores sell them as well.\nContents.\nOften overlooked by aspiring mages, &lt;a href=\"Alchemy\"&gt;Alchemy&lt;/a&gt; is a time-honored, rewarding discipline that can change the lives of those who master it. It is difficult, and often dangerous, to advance one's knowledge of the materials used in alchemical formulas, but continued study and hard work will, in the end, reward the alchemist greatly.\nBefore success can be achieved, or even attempted, the beginning alchemist must understand the basic principles behind his craft. Many items in our world, mostly organic in nature, can be broken down into more fundamental essences with magickal properties. The more skilled the Alchemist, the more properites of an ingredient that can be harnessed. Combining the essences of two or more &lt;a href=\"Ingredients\"&gt;Ingredients&lt;/a&gt; can result in the creation of a &lt;a href=\"Potion\"&gt;Potion&lt;/a&gt;, which anyone may then drink. (Legend has it that a truly great Alchemist can brew potions from a single ingredient, a feat well beyond the capabilities of most.)\nThe Alchemist's potion can have several effects, depending on the ingredients used, and not all effects are beneficial. In many cases, recipes result in a potion with a mix of positive and negative effects; it is up to the Alchemist to determine which recipes yield the best results. (It is worth noting that potions can be created to have only negative effects and be used as poisons. This practice is not recommended by the author, and this text shall not discuss such potions further.)\nWortcraft.\nWortcraft is, in fact, amateur Alchemy. Eating an ingredient requires grinding it against the teeth, which occasionally releases its simplest essence and results in a fleeting effect on the eater. Wortcraft never has as strong a result as a potion created using the proper tools.\nAn Alchemist's Tools.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Mortar%20and%20Pestle\"&gt;Mortar and Pestle&lt;/a&gt; is the Alchemist's most important and essential tool. Without it, no ingredient can be correctly prepared for use in a potion. The budding alchemist is advised to keep a mortar and pestle on hand at all times, and become comfortable with its use early on. The simple grinding of an ingredient is the most fundamental step in brewing potions. When properly ground, the petals of the Redwort flower yield a powder that can, when mixed correctly with another ingredient such as ginseng, create a potion to &lt;a href=\"Cure%20Poison\"&gt;cure poison&lt;/a&gt;. (This is one formula that many alchemists are quick to learn and retain, as mistakes in potion mixing often require its use.)\nThe advanced Alchemist has other tools at his disposal to improve the quality of his potions. A &lt;a href=\"Retort\"&gt;Retort&lt;/a&gt; can be employed to purify the mixture, improving the positive effects of a potion. Washing the mixture through an &lt;a href=\"Alembic\"&gt;Alembic&lt;/a&gt; helps to distill the potion, reducing any negative effects, and a &lt;a href=\"Calcinator\"&gt;Calcinator&lt;/a&gt; can be used to burn away impurities in the mixture, increasing the potency of all the potion's effects. While these apparatus are not necessary to create potions, it is advised that they be used whenever possible.\nIngredient Combination.\nA potion is only as good as its ingredients. Only those with identical effects may be combined to make a potion; up to four ingredients may be successfully used in a single potion.\nAs the Alchemist gains skill in preparing ingredients, new properties may be discovered and can be used in creating potions. While this can be an exciting time, expanding the Alchemist's repertoire, he should take care to check carefully which effects his potions will contain when he is done brewing. Many established recipes may have new results, not all of which are beneficial."}

They are excellent &lt;a href=\"Alchemy%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;alchemy&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Ingredients%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;ingredients&lt;/a&gt; used for the creation of &lt;a href=\"Potions%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;potions&lt;/a&gt; and are generally easy to find.\nIn , harvested fungi from Skyrim proper can be planted in &lt;a href=\"garden\"&gt;garden&lt;/a&gt;s and &lt;a href=\"greenhouse\"&gt;greenhouse&lt;/a&gt;s at &lt;a href=\"Homestead%20%28Hearthfire%29\"&gt;homesteads&lt;/a&gt;.\nSpecies.\nThe following have been discovered across the &lt;a href=\"holds\"&gt;holds&lt;/a&gt; of Skyrim:\nFairy rings.\nFound directly south of &lt;a href=\"Knifepoint%20Ridge\"&gt;Knifepoint Ridge&lt;/a&gt;, there is a small cluster of white caps and rocks that create a perfect &lt;a href=\"White%20Cap%20Circle\"&gt;circle&lt;/a&gt;, known as a &lt;a href=\"Fairy%20Circle\"&gt;fairy ring&lt;/a&gt;. A copy of \"&lt;a href=\"Father%20of%20the%20Niben\"&gt;Father of the Niben&lt;/a&gt;\" and a leveled staff lie in the center of this formation.\nThere is another fairy ring, wider but less dense, consisting of many different species of fungi. It is in the woods northeast of &lt;a href=\"Bilegulch%20Mine\"&gt;Bilegulch Mine&lt;/a&gt; or south-west of &lt;a href=\"Fort%20Sungard\"&gt;Fort Sungard&lt;/a&gt;. It might be hard to find, but a &lt;a href=\"Dragon%20Burial%20Mound\"&gt;Dragon Burial Mound&lt;/a&gt; is nearby. The easiest way to get there is to go to Fort Sungard and jump off the southern wall (quite a high jump). Next, cross the paved road and head uphill towards the Bilegulch Mine. After few steps there will be a dragon burial mound to the left, the fairy ring is a few steps further.\nGiant fungi.\nGiant fungi can be found in various damp locations around Skyrim. The ancient &lt;a href=\"Dwemer%20Ruins%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Dwemer Ruin&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Irkngthand\"&gt;Irkngthand&lt;/a&gt; contains a few species of giant fungi including large glowing mushrooms. The Dwemer ruins of &lt;a href=\"Blackreach%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Blackreach&lt;/a&gt; are forested with giant glowing mushrooms. &lt;a href=\"Darkfall%20Cave\"&gt;Darkfall Cave&lt;/a&gt; contains a good amount of large fungi.\nIn , there is a group of giant mushrooms named &lt;a href=\"Tel%20Mithryn\"&gt;Tel Mithryn&lt;/a&gt;, built and cultivated by &lt;a href=\"House%20Telvanni\"&gt;Telvanni&lt;/a&gt; Wizard &lt;a href=\"Neloth%20%28Dragonborn%29\"&gt;Neloth&lt;/a&gt; in the southeast of &lt;a href=\"Solstheim%20%28Dragonborn%29\"&gt;Solstheim&lt;/a&gt;. These mushrooms are called &lt;a href=\"Telvanni%20Tower\"&gt;Telvanni Tower&lt;/a&gt;s\u00a0and also appeared in . They contain the living and work spaces for Telvanni wizards and their servants.\nIn Morrowind and Dragonborn, there are giant mushrooms named &lt;a href=\"Emperor%20Parasol\"&gt;Emperor Parasol&lt;/a&gt;s. In Morrowind, they grow along the coast of the &lt;a href=\"Ascadian%20Isles\"&gt;Ascadian Isles&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Azura%27s%20Coast\"&gt;Azura's Coast&lt;/a&gt; regions. In Dragonborn, they grow near &lt;a href=\"Tel%20Mithryn\"&gt;Tel Mithryn&lt;/a&gt; and some of them have &lt;a href=\"Emperor%20Parasol%20Moss\"&gt;Emperor Parasol Moss&lt;/a&gt; hanging from them. \nIn , giant mushrooms and semi-giant mushrooms grow that yield &lt;a href=\"black%20tar\"&gt;black tar&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"unrefined%20greenmote\"&gt;unrefined greenmote&lt;/a&gt;."}

This is no surprise, since both Sea Elves and Sload are at war with the rest of the world. The Maormer's grievance seems to be that they got stuck with &lt;a href=\"Pyandonea\"&gt;Pyandonea&lt;/a&gt;, a sad and swampy archipelago of malodorous islets; why the Sload are so belligerent to all others is unknown.\nOn the &lt;a href=\"Coral%20Tower\"&gt;Coral Tower&lt;/a&gt;: Since the Coral Tower fell during the invasion of &lt;a href=\"Thras\"&gt;Thras&lt;/a&gt; by the &lt;a href=\"All-Flags%20Navy\"&gt;All-Flags Navy&lt;/a&gt;, at this point the best we can do is make educated guesses about it. In their own perverse way, the Sload are very capable sorcerers, and from all accounts the Coral Tower acted as both a focus and a projector of mystical power. I am not a scholar of Tower Lore\u2014my interests tend more toward the practical\u2014but this accords (somewhat) with what the mythohistorians claim is the purpose and practice of the so-called &lt;a href=\"The%20Towers\"&gt;Towers&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"Nirn\"&gt;Nirn&lt;/a&gt;. Was the Coral Tower a \"real\" tower like &lt;a href=\"Lawful%20Crystal\"&gt;Lawful Crystal&lt;/a&gt;, here on &lt;a href=\"Summerset%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Summerset&lt;/a&gt;, or was it a failed imitation, like the &lt;a href=\"Doomcrag\"&gt;Doomspire&lt;/a&gt;? I do not think we have the answers based on what little we know.\nOn &lt;a href=\"Sload%20Soap\"&gt;Sload Soap&lt;/a&gt;: But enough speculation\u2014on to a subject about which, for once, we can be certain: Sload Soap! There are many misconceptions about the origin of Sload Soap, and I am happy to have an opportunity to clear it up. First, let us consider the metamorphic biology of the Sload. They begin life on the Thrassian Atolls as, in the words of Admiral &lt;a href=\"Bendu%20Olo\"&gt;Bendu Olo&lt;/a&gt;, \"disgusting little amorphous grubs.\" Ignored by their pendulous parents, these grubs somehow squirm their way to the sea, where they mutate into aquatic quasi-cephalopods known as \"polywygles.\" Due to their corpulence, adult Sload spend a great deal of time in the shallow lagoons of their atolls, wallowing among the polywygles. Those larvae that prove too slow to avoid their parents' pseudopods are caught and harvested, culling out the weak and providing the raw material for Sload Soap.\nCaptured polywygles are tossed into an ever-bubbling cauldron where they gradually deliquesce into a slimy broth. This broth undergoes an alchemical commixture with materials known only to the Sload, after which it is poured into molds and allowed to cool. Once solid, the bars are scooped out and wrapped in the viscera of hagfish for preservation.\nIt is believed that the Sload use this soap as a primary component in their necromantic rituals. I'm not expert on necromancy, but apparently having an emulsified reagent concocted from one's own descendants acts as a profound intensifier in the magic of undeath. Sload Soap is rarely seen away from Thras, and when it is it commands high prices from alchemists, who relish its unique properties for creating potions of agility and, rarest of all, the mutation of personality. &lt;a href=\"Alianora%20the%20Red\"&gt;Alianora the Red&lt;/a&gt;, our &lt;a href=\"Sapiarch\"&gt;Sapiarch&lt;/a&gt; of Alchemy, says that Sload Soap has never been thoroughly analyzed outside of Thras, and may contain more undiscovered alchemical properties. Plus, it's an exceptional cleanser, deep-cleaning yet mild, that leaves your skin feeling youthful and refreshed."}

As such, the Queen orders the Hero to stay in the town and plan an attack on the River Snake, while she goes out to hunt for treasure.\nSpeaking to Sabina Clovia, it becomes clear that not only the hero, but also Sabina has been forced to remain in the town. The two will come to an agreement, following the Queen while she explores, and jumping into action if need be.\nUpon arrival at the location, the hero must defeat two bears while entering a cave. In the area with the second bear, on the right side, is a room with a troll. Here on the wall on the right is a stone which can be activated, showing the first secret room. After progressing through the cave the hero will encounter a brick wall. In the right corner is a lever, activating which, the wall opens.\nThe Hero now enters a keep, filled with mercenaries, who they have to kill. After progressing a bit through the keep, a large open area is found, with a staircase going up on the right, and a room with a silver chest on the left. In the room on the left, a boss is encountered, named Murzog, a female Orsimer.\nProgressing via the staircase, and following the path, the Hero will arrive in a large open area. Here, the Bloodfall Queen, Wanum, and Gabrielle Larouche are seen, as well as the River Snake. Gabrielle Larouche walks over to the side of the River Snake, and a small battle breaks out, resulting in the Queen and Wanum being captured.\nThe Hero then defeats Larouche, and rescues the Queen. Sabina summoned a flame atronach during the battle which set the place on fire. On the way to the exit, in the room where &lt;a href=\"Vilfred%20the%20Unseen\"&gt;Vilfred the Unseen&lt;/a&gt; is held, one of the secrets is found. On the wall to the right a lever is found. Activating it will open up the secret room."}

I have built a shrine to watch over him and bring peace to weary travelers.\nOf the few riches Gadnor possessed in life, his most prized was a warhammer made of jagged crystal he famously won in a coin toss. After months of research, he came to believe this hammer was some sort of otherworldly treasure. Shortly before his passing, it was his wish that it be hidden away until \"one who has walked the Shivering Isles\" emerges to retrieve it. I have followed his instructions to the letter, and a powerful illusion spell now obscures it.\nTo break the spell, one must first acquire pieces of what supposedly make up the weapon itself, \"amber\" and \"madness ore.\" Such things, if they actually exist, would be great treasures in their own right. If the enchantment is correct, only by placing the ores into the embers near Gadnor's body will the spell be broken.\nIf Gadnor is not mad, perhaps one day this peerless weapon will find its way into worthy hands once again."}

A chance to finally be free of it all.\nAnd then Mother moved in with her. Mother, with her incessant whining, constant complaining, cutting insults. Is Tajirri really going to wear that today? Is Tajirri sure that she wants another sugar claw?\nSo first, a bit of drinking to help ease Tajirri's annoyance. And then a bit of gambling, just to get out of the house. Which of course led to quite a bit of debt. Which led to even more drinking, even more gambling, even more debt.\nAnd now back to smuggling, because Tajirri has debts to pay and a house to keep. Lucky for this one that &lt;a href=\"Rideza\"&gt;Rideza&lt;/a&gt; should show up in town, just as Tajirri was getting desperate. Or perhaps it has nothing to do with luck. Perhaps Rideza somehow knew.\nJust a few jobs, that's it. Help Rideza squeeze all the gold she can get out of Riverhold, and then Tajirri won't have to worry about her debts anymore."}

Before that, upon entering, expect to see a fist fight occur between &lt;a href=\"Athis\"&gt;Athis&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Njada%20Stonearm\"&gt;Njada Stonearm&lt;/a&gt;, which will continue until the Dragonborn gets close enough for it to end once Njada overpowers Athis. Heading to Kodlak, he will tell &lt;a href=\"Vilkas\"&gt;Vilkas&lt;/a&gt; to take the Dragonborn out to the courtyard to prove their worth in strength. If one happens to lose sight of him, he can be found outside practicing with one of the target dummies. He will then instruct the Dragonborn to take a few swings at him so he can gauge their skill. Vilkas will draw his sword and shield, but will refrain from attacking. After about three swings, he will yield and give a few humbling remarks. This part of the quest ends with Vilkas handing the Dragonborn his sword to bring to &lt;a href=\"Eorlund%20Gray-Mane\"&gt;Eorlund Gray-Mane&lt;/a&gt;.\nGive Vilkas's Sword to Eorlund.\nEorlund Gray-Mane is found right next to the courtyard, up a set of stairs and next to the &lt;a href=\"Skyforge%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Skyforge&lt;/a&gt;. Once the Dragonborn explains that Vilkas sent them with his sword, he rightly assumes them to be the newcomer. He will then ask them to do a favor for him by taking &lt;a href=\"Aela%27s%20shield\"&gt;Aela's shield&lt;/a&gt; back to her.\nBring Aela Her Shield.\nLeave the Skyforge and go to Jorrvaskr's living quarters. Aela the Huntress can be found in her room speaking with &lt;a href=\"Skjor\"&gt;Skjor&lt;/a&gt;. Once her shield is returned to her, she will recognize the Dragonborn from their first encounter with the giant. She will then tell Farkas to show the Dragonborn their sleeping quarters, thus completing the quest.\nFollow Farkas.\nAfter being shown the sleeping quarters, Farkas will express that he is pleased to see a new face, and will suggest that the Dragonborn talk to either him or Aela if they are looking for work. This completes the quest and the \"Take Up Arms\" achievement will unlock.\nFarkas will then offer the Dragonborn a job to help with some trouble in &lt;a href=\"Whiterun%20Hold\"&gt;Whiterun Hold&lt;/a&gt;. Accepting his offer will start the quest \"&lt;a href=\"Trouble%20in%20Skyrim\"&gt;Trouble in Skyrim&lt;/a&gt;\", one of the radiant quests offered by the Companions and is necessary to complete to move on to the next main quest for the Companions, \"&lt;a href=\"Proving%20Honor\"&gt;Proving Honor&lt;/a&gt;.\""}
