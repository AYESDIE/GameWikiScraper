Her voice was silk, coiled thick and made into a noose.\nHistory.\n&lt;a href=\"Umbriel%20Crisis\"&gt;Umbriel Crisis&lt;/a&gt;.\nPhmer was one of the four chefs that was invited to present a tasting for &lt;a href=\"Lord%20Rhel\"&gt;Lord Rhel&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href=\"Toel\"&gt;Toel&lt;/a&gt; warned &lt;a href=\"Anna%C3%AFg\"&gt;Anna\u00efg&lt;/a&gt; that Phmer would be their main rival in the competition. In order to achieve victory, Toel entrusted Anna\u00efg to find the ninth savor for him. Anna\u00efg eventually realised Toel wanted her to steal the recipe of the ninth savor from Phmer. She told &lt;a href=\"Slyr\"&gt;Slyr&lt;/a&gt; about her intention to steal the recipe. Slyr warned her that if she was caught, Phmer could demand Toel give Anna\u00efg to her by law. However, Anna\u00efg was decided to carry out her plan.\nThe day after Anna\u00efg supposedly stole the recipe, she was called upon Toel's balcony. Phmer and her assistants, Jolha and Egren, were waiting for her. Phmer accused her of stealing the ninth savor: Slyr had betrayed Anna\u00efg to Phmer. Phmer took an insect-like creature that could detect the ninth savor, and brought it near Anna\u00efg. Yet, the creature pointed at Slyr. Anna\u00efg had synthesized the ninth savor on her own. She knew Slyr was going to betray her, so she loaned Slyr her dress impregnated with the ninth savor and with a small vial filled with the ninth savor in the pocket. Phmer believed that it was Slyr who stole the ninth savor, and she demanded Toel to capture her. Phmer also demanded to interrogate Anna\u00efg, but Toel refused to do so.\nPhmer and her kitchen later took part in &lt;a href=\"Lord%20Rhel\"&gt;Lord Rhel&lt;/a&gt;'s competition. Despite being the favored to win, Anna\u00efg beat her. Phmer congratulated Anna\u00efg and she told her that she knew that Anna\u00efg had killed Toel."}

Combos and &lt;a href=\"Critical%20%28Blades%29\"&gt;critical&lt;/a&gt; hits increase the base amount of physical damage. Abilities, while also allowing shields to deal physical damage, can increase the power of a wielded weapon. &lt;a href=\"Enchanting%20%28Blades%29\"&gt;Enchantments&lt;/a&gt; are able to boost the amount of damage dealt by weapons or abilities.

The higher the armor rating, the lower the amount of damage dealt will be. The quality of the armor is also a factor that determines its effectiveness at reducing damage. &lt;a href=\"Tempering%20%28Blades%29\"&gt;Tempering&lt;/a&gt; armor with the appropriate materials at the &lt;a href=\"Smithy%20%28Blades%29\"&gt;smithy&lt;/a&gt; can increase the base armor rating of the piece. Similarly to weapons, armor can also be more effective in guarding against specific types of physical damage depending on the material they are made out of.\nUnlike worn armor, shields and weapons do not provide constant defense against physical damage, but will only guard against it while &lt;a href=\"Block%20%28Blades%29\"&gt;blocking&lt;/a&gt;. There are two types of blocks; high blocking and low blocking. High blocks are able to block more damage than a low block, as well as stagger the opponent, leaving them open to be countered. While weapons can also be used for blocking, if the player character needs to guard often, they will wear down at a quicker pace compared to when using a shield."}

Some reason for study is concocted, in the hopes that the writer's obsession will be seen in a more noble light. I make no such pretensions. No &lt;a href=\"Werewolf%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;werewolf&lt;/a&gt; killed my family, none ever threatened me personally, nor even an acquaintance of mine. My obsession is borne out of simple curiosity, with a strong dose of hatred for the unnatural. Is it possible to hate something without having been done harm by it? I am no philosopher, and thus here ends my introduction. On with my studies.\nI have endeavored, over the course of several decades, to perform a complete study of the physical nature of the creatures we call werewolves. I overlook entirely the origins of this plague, whether it is acquired voluntarily or inflicted, and how one might be cured. Such matters are filled with too much guesswork and rambling second-hand inanities from farmhands.\nSubject A\n\"Captured\": in &lt;a href=\"Morrowind\"&gt;Morrowind&lt;/a&gt;, while in beast form\n\"Makeup\": Male, &lt;a href=\"Bretons%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Breton&lt;/a&gt; in his true form\n\"Notes\": Subject shows an unusually high degree of control over his transformations.\nExperiment 1 -- Subject's bodily proportions were thoroughly measured before, during, and after the transformation. As expected, the proportions were identical while in true form, but some minor swelling of the head was observed immediately after the return. Changes observed during transformation:23% increase in shoulder width17% narrowing of hips47% lengthening of arms7% increase in finger length (not accounting for claws)As for the legs -- the lengthening of the foot to several times its normal length seems to account for the otherwise negligible changes in the thigh region.Experiment 2-- Subject was coerced into changing as rapidly and as frequently as possible, at various times and at various levels of duress. Transformation times and effects were not viewed to change notably. Subject expired, concluding tests.\nSubject B\n\"Captured\": in &lt;a href=\"Cyrodiil\"&gt;Cyrodiil&lt;/a&gt;, already imprisoned by local authorities, in true form\n\"Makeup\": Female, &lt;a href=\"Nords%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Nord&lt;/a&gt; in her true form\n\"Notes\": Subject's large size in both true and transformed forms makes an excellent fit for vivisection\nI believe I may have been the first to witness a werewolf transformation ply its effects on the internal workings of a creature. The heart is the first thing to swell, long before the lungs or bones shift to accommodate it. This may account for the intense chest pains that some of the afflicted report directly before their changes.\nMore interesting were the changes observed in the muscles of the legs. I had expected a strengthening, as the beasts are known for great power and speed, but they also seemed to change color into a dusky brown. This could also be attributed to blood loss from the procedures.\nBefore the subject expired, I worked applying some known \"remedies\" for the disease directly to internal organs. &lt;a href=\"Wolfsbane%20petals\"&gt;Wolfsbane petals&lt;/a&gt; applied to the bones seemed to render them brittle, and the ribcage nearly collapsed at the touch. The juice of ripened belladonna berries was pressed directly into the veins, and they could be seen to shrivel behind the flow as it moved through the system. Upon reaching the heart, the major vessels pulled away completely, and subject expired within minutes."}

The &lt;a href=\"Last%20Dragonborn\"&gt;Dragonborn&lt;/a&gt; is free to peruse their target's inventory, without breaking the law. Unsuccessfully removing or adding an object will raise the Dragonborn's &lt;a href=\"Bounty%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;bounty&lt;/a&gt;, often causing the intended victim to become hostile. &lt;a href=\"Children\"&gt;Children&lt;/a&gt; cannot be pickpocketed, regardless of skill level or perks chosen.\nThere are many opportunities for lucrative pickpocketing to offset the significant costs of investing perks in the skill. Many characters will carry large amounts of gold or valuable jewelry that is frequently enchanted. Gold from training or bribes will also be in the characters' inventory which can then be stolen with the Pickpocket skill.\nThere is an unknown formula for maximum gold value that can be pickpocketed based on the level of the character's Pickpocket skill and which perks they have. This can result in situations where even a small change in gold value can result in huge swings in percentage chance of success. This problem can be avoided altogether by paralyzing the victim first, as it is possible to pickpocket anything from them without detection as they are getting back up.\nThe amount and weight of an item determines the difficulty of pickpocketing it. However, the item's value determines how much the skill is leveled by after being successfully pickpocketed.\nPerks.\nThe following are the perks that become available to select as the skill is leveled up:\n&lt;onlyinclude&gt;\n&lt;/onlyinclude&gt;\nLeveling.\nBooks.\nThe following books provide a permanent one-time increase to the Dragonborn's Pickpocket skill.

I felt cold stones at my own back and realized I'd done the same.\nThe translucent blue phantasm, clad in armor of antique design, drifted between us, halted at the entrance, and turned. \"This is the day, isn't it?\" she demanded in hollow tones. \"The day of the attack!\"\n\"Y-yes, Countess,\" I said, surprised at my ability to speak. \"Right d-day, but wrong century.\"\n\"What?\" She flew at me, spectral hands raised like claws. Somehow, I shrank even further into the wall. \"What? Not \u2026 again.\"\n\"That's right!\" Falinne piped up. \"Wrong century, wrong year! Go back to sleep, Grandmother.\"\n\"Wrong \u2026 year,\" the spectre said slowly. \"Back \u2026 to sleep.\"\nAnd to our immense relief, the Countess' ghost began drifting back down the stairs, fading as it went.\n\"Gales of &lt;a href=\"Kynareth\"&gt;Kynareth&lt;/a&gt;!\" Falinne said, sinking to the floor. \"I need a drink. You?\"\n\"Oh, yes. At least one,\" I said, as she poured the syllabub. \"What's taking so long?\"\n\"My hands are shaking. Here.\"\nI drained the milk-and-cider to the dregs and passed the mug back for more. Then I took a deep breath and began, \"Falinne, I'm really, really sorry. I never thought\u2026.\"\n\"Don't worry about it,\" she said. \"Here, have some more. Think what a great story it'll make back at the Anchor's Point.\"\n\"You're not angry? Really?\"\n\"No, Jacques. Not angry.\"\n\"Well then, let me carve the \u2026 huh, that's funny.\" As I reached for the plate of pigeons, I felt a wave of cold pass over my body, and my hand fell short. \"By &lt;a href=\"Arkay\"&gt;Arkay&lt;/a&gt;, what \u2026?\" I tried to stand, got as far as my knees and then fell over onto the blanket. \"Falinne, something's \u2026 something's wrong.\"\n\"It's nothing, dearest,\" she said, smiling sweetly. \"I just drugged your syllabub with a paralyzing potion.\"\n\"D-drugged?\" I mumbled. \"Why?\"\n\"Because there's this really exclusive club I want to join. &lt;a href=\"Namira\"&gt;Namira&lt;/a&gt;'s Forgotten? But to be admitted, you have to consume human flesh. It's quite thrilling, Jacques!\" She drew a slender, razor-sharp blade from her bodice.\n\"Now, let's see\u2014where shall I begin?\""}

He'll give me the details inside his house in Dawnstar.\"\nWalkthrough.\n&lt;a href=\"Silus%20Vesuius\"&gt;Silus Vesuius&lt;/a&gt;, a devotee of &lt;a href=\"Mythic%20Dawn%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;The Mythic Dawn&lt;/a&gt; cult, asks the &lt;a href=\"Last%20Dragonborn\"&gt;Dragonborn&lt;/a&gt; to retrieve the separated pieces of a &lt;a href=\"Daggers%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;dagger&lt;/a&gt; named &lt;a href=\"Mehrunes%27%20Razor%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Mehrunes' Razor&lt;/a&gt; that once belonged to his family.\nTo start the quest, the Dragonborn must be at least level 20 and get an &lt;a href=\"Museum%20Pamphlet\"&gt;invitation&lt;/a&gt; to Silus' &lt;a href=\"Silus%20Vesuius%27s%20House\"&gt;Mythic Dawn Museum&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Dawnstar%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Dawnstar&lt;/a&gt;. The invitation can be received by either waiting until he appears, or &lt;a href=\"Fast%20Travel%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;fast traveling&lt;/a&gt; to any major area (village, town, city, etc.) where eventually a &lt;a href=\"Courier%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Courier&lt;/a&gt; will approach to deliver the invitation personally. Another way to begin this quest is to walk around Dawnstar until overhearing someone mentioning the museum. The quest also begins by hearing a rumor about the museum from any barkeep. There will be a &lt;a href=\"Miscellaneous%20Quests%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;miscellaneous quest&lt;/a&gt;, \"Visit the museum in Dawnstar,\" in the quest log.\nMuseum of the Mythic Dawn.\nAfter receiving the invitation, head to Dawnstar and approach the museum. The Dragonborn can speak to Silus inside his house in Dawnstar, shortly after witnessing a conversation between him and Skald's court mage, voicing her concern about what Silus is doing. As soon as it is entered, the miscellaneous quest will be completed. He will tell of his ancestors who were members of Mythic Dawn, the cult from responsible for the assassination of &lt;a href=\"Emperor%20Uriel%20Septim%20VII\"&gt;Emperor Uriel Septim VII&lt;/a&gt; and the resulting &lt;a href=\"Oblivion%20Crisis\"&gt;Oblivion Crisis&lt;/a&gt;. Silus wants the Dragonborn to find the three pieces of Mehrunes' Razor. He will say the parts of the razor are with an &lt;a href=\"Orsimer%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Orc&lt;/a&gt; named &lt;a href=\"Ghunzul\"&gt;Ghunzul&lt;/a&gt;, a &lt;a href=\"Hagraven%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Hagraven&lt;/a&gt; named &lt;a href=\"Drascua\"&gt;Drascua&lt;/a&gt;, and the last with &lt;a href=\"Jorgen\"&gt;Jorgen&lt;/a&gt;, who lives in &lt;a href=\"Morthal%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Morthal&lt;/a&gt;.\nAs each piece is returned to Silus, he gladly accepts them and rewards the Dragonborn with a leveled amount of gold.\nThe Hilt of Mehrunes' Razor.\nJorgen is one of the keepers of a part of Mehrunes' Razor, in Morthal. He will (usually) be near his house across the bridge. The hilt is in an adept-locked chest in Jorgen's house. His house can be entered by picking the novice-level lock to open it, pickpocketing the key off of him, or killing him and taking the key from his body.\nAn alternative is to speak to him and either pay him off, persuade him, intimidate him or brawl him for it. Brawling with him may be the easiest way, as he can be defeated relatively quickly.\nThe Pommel of Mehrunes' Razor.\nDrascua is holed up in a keep south-west of &lt;a href=\"Markarth%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Markarth&lt;/a&gt; called &lt;a href=\"Dead%20Crone%20Rock\"&gt;Dead Crone Rock&lt;/a&gt;. She will be surrounded and guarded by &lt;a href=\"Forsworn\"&gt;Forsworn&lt;/a&gt; and three fire traps. She has the Pommel on her person, so it can be taken from her corpse after she is dead. There is a &lt;a href=\"Word%20Walls%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Word Wall&lt;/a&gt; where part of the &lt;a href=\"Dismay\"&gt;Dismay&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"shout\"&gt;shout&lt;/a&gt; can be learned. On the sacrificial altar here there is a &lt;a href=\"Stone%20of%20Barenziah\"&gt;Stone of Barenziah&lt;/a&gt;. Note that while the quest marker points to the lower ruin entrance, one can skip much of the interior and work one's way up the exterior stairs to the Dead Crone Rock entrance door and proceed from there.\nThe Shards of Mehrunes' Razor.\nThere are three methods to get the last piece found in &lt;a href=\"Cracked%20Tusk%20Keep\"&gt;Cracked Tusk Keep&lt;/a&gt;, a &lt;a href=\"Bandits%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;bandit&lt;/a&gt; stronghold west of &lt;a href=\"Falkreath%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Falkreath&lt;/a&gt; full of Orsimer:\nOnce the gate is opened, the vaults can be entered. Down the narrow path, the room with the shards on a pedestal will be reached. Activating the two levers on either side of the door will allow progress towards the shards. There are numerous tripwires and arrows that barrage from the ceiling when the shards are lifted from the pressure plate on the pedestal.\nIf the Dragonborn has the &lt;a href=\"Telekinesis%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Telekinesis&lt;/a&gt; spell, they can retrieve the shards of the dagger from its pedestal by using the spell and standing in the doorway, avoiding all harm. But in doing so, it is possible to miss the chest that is in the right side of the room with the shards.\nAlternatively, a bucket to the right of the pedestal can be picked up and used to slide the shards off the pedestal, replacing the shards. This allows you to obtain the shards without the use of a Telekinesis spell or being damaged by the traps. You can jump over the trip wires to bypass them.\nThe Shrine of Mehrunes Dagon.\n\"You. Mortal. You are worthy of speaking to. You have claimed the pieces of my Razor. It has been an amusing game to witness. But Dagon does not declare a winner while there is a pawn on the board. Kill Silus. He and his family have served their purpose.\"\nAfter delivering all three pieces to Silus, the quest continues at the &lt;a href=\"Shrine%20of%20Mehrunes%20Dagon\"&gt;Shrine of Mehrunes Dagon&lt;/a&gt;, where the Razor can be repaired. Be wary that there will almost always be at least one frost dragon there due to the very close word wall/burial ground of &lt;a href=\"Skyborn%20Altar\"&gt;Skyborn Altar&lt;/a&gt;. Regardless, Silus will next try to perform the task of speaking with &lt;a href=\"Mehrunes%20Dagon\"&gt;Mehrunes Dagon&lt;/a&gt;. Receiving no answer from Dagon, Silus will ask the Dragonborn to try. Dagon will respond, and he will then explain that in order for him to repair the Razor, Silus must be killed. There are two choices: kill Silus and receive the restored dagger or spare him and receive 500.\nSilus will approach the Dragonborn to plead for his life:\n\"Wait. Wait. Don't kill me. There's another way. I can take the pieces back to my museum. Seal them in a display case. You get a generous amount of gold, I get to complete my collection, and nobody has to die.\"\nIf Silus was killed, Dagon will speak with the Dragonborn:\n\"I am pleased, mortal. I will give you my Razor. Use it to wreak havoc on Tamriel.\"\n\"Before you go, mortal. One final challenge. Ha ha ha.\"\nIf Silus is spared:\n\"You think to betray Mehrunes Dagon? Suffer!\"\nRegardless of the choice, two &lt;a href=\"Dremora%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Dremora&lt;/a&gt; appear; they can be killed and looted for the Key to Mehrunes' Shrine and &lt;a href=\"Daedra%20Heart%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Daedra hearts&lt;/a&gt;. Inside the shrine, there are two more Dremora, three chests, some random ingredients, and many ingots of varying metals.\nShould Silus survive, he will return to his home with the fragments and place them into a sealed display case that cannot be further interacted with."}

The correct answer is lead, and the atronach will allow the Nerevarine to continue.\nRiddle of the Frost Daedra.\nFurther into the cavern, the Nerevarine will find the Frost Atronach, standing on a frozen pool. It will also give the Nerevarine a riddle to solve:\nThere are then two options available to the Nerevarine: The first is to say that it will indeed slay the Nerevarine with a spell, or that the Atronach will kill them by sword. The correct answer is \"Slay with a sword.\" The Atronach will, then, explain the reasoning behind the riddle, and allow the Nerevarine to pass.\nRiddle of the Storm Daedra.\nThe final Atronach, can be found a little deeper in the Cavern.

The quest can be obtained simply by reading a copy of \"&lt;a href=\"The%20Pilgrim%27s%20Path%20%28Book%29\"&gt;The Pilgrim's Path&lt;/a&gt;\", which can be found across &lt;a href=\"Vvardenfell%20%28Morrowind%29\"&gt;Vvardenfell&lt;/a&gt; or from any Tribunal Temple quest giver. Once started, the Nerevarine may visit the shrines in any order, which will be marked on the Nerevarine's map.\nOne strategy is to note that the shrine blessings have a very long duration of 48 minutes and that several of the shrines are clustered together (see location map to the right) with three of the seven in Vivec City and two more in or near Gnisis. Doing the Shrine of Daring and then the Shrine of Courtesy will give the Nerevarine enough time to complete the Shrine of Generosity, fly to the Shrine of Humility, then to the Shrine of Pride, then over to the Shrine of Justice in Gnisis and south to the Shrine of Valor with enough time left on both levitation and water breathing to fully explore Koal Cave. On the map, this ordering is 7,6,5,1,2,3,4.\n&lt;a href=\"Fields%20of%20Kummu%20%28Morrowind%20Location%29\"&gt;Shrine of Humility&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe Shrine of Humility can be found within the &lt;a href=\"Fields%20of%20Kummu%20%28Morrowind%20Location%29\"&gt;Fields of Kummu&lt;/a&gt;, between two trees to the north of &lt;a href=\"Lake%20Amaya%20%28Morrowind%29\"&gt;Lake Amaya&lt;/a&gt; and just west of &lt;a href=\"Alof%27s%20Farmhouse\"&gt;Alof's Farmhouse&lt;/a&gt;.

There is a little island, just south-west of the shrine, where muck can be easily harvested.\n&lt;a href=\"Ghostgate%23Shrine%20of%20Pride\"&gt;Shrine of Pride&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe Shrine of Pride is just northeast of &lt;a href=\"Ghostgate\"&gt;Ghostgate&lt;/a&gt;, which is found along the &lt;a href=\"Foyada%20Mamaea\"&gt;Foyada Mamaea&lt;/a&gt;. The Shrine is located down a track, off of the &lt;a href=\"Foyada\"&gt;Foyada&lt;/a&gt; to the northeast, leading from the main track to the right, beyond the Ghostgate. The Nerevarine must donate a &lt;a href=\"Soul%20Gem%20%28Morrowind%29\"&gt;soul gem&lt;/a&gt; of any size, with or without a soul, to the Shrine to receive the &lt;a href=\"Ghostgate%20Shrine%20Blessing\"&gt;Ghostgate Shrine Blessing&lt;/a&gt;: &lt;a href=\"Fortify%20Magicka%20%28Morrowind%29\"&gt;Fortify Magicka&lt;/a&gt; for 50 points and &lt;a href=\"Shield%20%28Morrowind%20Spell%29\"&gt;Shield&lt;/a&gt; for 25 points during 48 minutes. Note that passing through the Ghostgate airlock is not required if the Nerevarine can fly over the &lt;a href=\"Ghostfence\"&gt;Ghostfence&lt;/a&gt;.\n&lt;a href=\"Gnisis%20Temple%20%28Morrowind%29%23Vivec%27s%20ashmask\"&gt;Shrine of Justice&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe Temple of Gnisis holds the Shrine of Justice, which can be found on the top floor of the temple, guarded by an &lt;a href=\"Ordinator%20%28Morrowind%29\"&gt;Ordinator&lt;/a&gt;. The Shrine's &lt;a href=\"Gnisis%20Shrine%20Blessing\"&gt;blessing&lt;/a&gt; can only be obtained through a donation of a &lt;a href=\"Potion%20of%20Cure%20Common%20Disease\"&gt;Potion of Cure Common Disease&lt;/a&gt;. If the Nerevarine interacts with the shrine again, the genuine version of\u00a0&lt;a href=\"Vivec%27s%20Ashmask\"&gt;Vivec's Ashmask&lt;/a&gt;\u00a0will be revealed. Interacting with the Mask will cause the Nerevarine to learn the spell &lt;a href=\"Vivec%27s%20Touch\"&gt;Vivec's Touch&lt;/a&gt;, a 100% effective &lt;a href=\"Cure%20Common%20Disease\"&gt;Cure Common Disease Spell&lt;/a&gt;.\n&lt;a href=\"The%20Shrine%20of%20Valor\"&gt;Shrine of Valor&lt;/a&gt;.\nKoal Cave is due south of &lt;a href=\"Gnisis%20%28Morrowind%29\"&gt;Gnisis&lt;/a&gt; and northwest of &lt;a href=\"Berandas\"&gt;Berandas&lt;/a&gt;, on the north shoreline. The Shrine of Valor is immediately inside the cave on the left. If the Nerevarine did not bring &lt;a href=\"Dreugh%20Wax\"&gt;Dreugh Wax&lt;/a&gt; with them, there are &lt;a href=\"Dreugh%20%28Morrowind%29\"&gt;Dreughs&lt;/a&gt; inhabiting the waterways of the filled cave which can be hunted for their wax. The Nerevarine must offer the sample of Dreugh Wax to the Shrine to receive the following &lt;a href=\"Koal%20Cave%20Blessing\"&gt;blessings&lt;/a&gt;: &lt;a href=\"Fortify%20%28Morrowind%29\"&gt;Fortify&lt;/a&gt; Unarmored, Fortify Light Armor, Fortify Medium Armor and &lt;a href=\"Fortify%20Heavy%20Armor\"&gt;Fortify Heavy Armor&lt;/a&gt; 10 points each, for 48 minutes. If the Nerevarine also kills the &lt;a href=\"Dreugh%20Warlord\"&gt;Dreugh Warlord&lt;/a&gt;, found deeper in the cave, then they will also receive a set of &lt;a href=\"Dreugh%20Cuirass\"&gt;Dreugh Cuirass&lt;/a&gt;.\n&lt;a href=\"Palace%20of%20Vivec%20%28Morrowind%29%23Shrine%20of%20Generosity\"&gt;Shrine of Generosity&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe Shrine of Generosity can be found outside the front doors at the top of the &lt;a href=\"Palace%20of%20Vivec\"&gt;Palace of Vivec&lt;/a&gt;, in &lt;a href=\"Vivec%20City%20%28Morrowind%29\"&gt;Vivec City&lt;/a&gt;.

Levitate (perhaps by having visited the Shrine of Daring first) to the third water gate on either side. The canal is H-shaped and the entrance to the center area is on the south side of the middle bar of the 'H'. The Nerevarine must read the riddle \"Breathe the Waters of His Glory and the Way is Made Clear\" by interacting with the Shrine. Once the Nerevarine has drowned by running out of breath and then taking damage until they are under ten hit points, they will be healed and must go across the bridge to hand a &lt;a href=\"Silver%20Longsword\"&gt;Silver Longsword&lt;/a&gt; to the &lt;a href=\"Dremora%20%28Morrowind%29\"&gt;Dremora&lt;/a&gt; named &lt;a href=\"Krazzt%20%28Morrowind%29\"&gt;Krazzt&lt;/a&gt;. There is a chest with five silver longswords next to Krazzt. The Shrine will then give the Nerevarine the &lt;a href=\"Puzzle%20Canal%20Blessings\"&gt;blessings&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"Water%20Breathing%20%28Morrowind%29\"&gt;Water Breathing&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Swift%20Swim\"&gt;Swift Swim&lt;/a&gt; with 25 points of speed, both for 48 minutes.\n&lt;a href=\"Temple%20Canton%20%28Morrowind%29%23The%20Shrine%20of%20Daring\"&gt;Shrine of Daring&lt;/a&gt;.\nOn the terrace of the &lt;a href=\"Temple%20Canton%20%28Morrowind%29\"&gt;Temple Canton&lt;/a&gt;, in the south-west corner, the Nerevarine will find the Shrine of Daring, to which the they must donate a &lt;a href=\"Potions%20%28Morrowind%29%23Rising%20Force\"&gt;Potion of Rising Force&lt;/a&gt; of any quality to the Shrine.

Pinepeak may appear to be a simple cavern along &lt;a href=\"Lake%20Geir\"&gt;Lake Geir&lt;/a&gt;, but in actuality, it is the ancient burial tomb of &lt;a href=\"Hakra\"&gt;Hakra&lt;/a&gt;, a member of the &lt;a href=\"Five%20Hundred%20Companions\"&gt;Five Hundred Companions&lt;/a&gt; and one of the slayers of &lt;a href=\"Sinmur\"&gt;Sinmur&lt;/a&gt;.\nDescription.\nGeography.\nPinepeak Cavern is an isolated cave located along the riverways descending down into the &lt;a href=\"Darkwater%20River\"&gt;Darkwater River&lt;/a&gt;. It is north of the bridge that leads into the &lt;a href=\"Seven%20Thousand%20Steps\"&gt;Seven Thousand Steps&lt;/a&gt; of the &lt;a href=\"Throat%20of%20the%20World\"&gt;Throat of the World&lt;/a&gt;, which is a part of the nearby township of &lt;a href=\"Ivarstead\"&gt;Ivarstead&lt;/a&gt;. The first area inside of Pinepeak is rather small, serving mainly as Bear den for any of the local wildlife. But the cave extends deeper, where there is an Ancient Nordic tomb. The cavern deeper into Pinepeak is vast, reminiscent of other natural caves, with natural stone bridges hovering the ground. Continuing into Pinepeak will reveal an Ancient Nordic tomb, which contains a simple room and a coffin in the middle. Other than that, Pinepeak is a rather insignificant cave.\nHistory.\n&lt;a href=\"Second%20Era\"&gt;Second Era&lt;/a&gt;.\nDuring the &lt;a href=\"Interregnum\"&gt;Interregnum&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"2E%20582\"&gt;2E 582&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"Order%20of%20the%20Black%20Worm\"&gt;Order of the Black Worm&lt;/a&gt; raged war against the &lt;a href=\"Ebonheart%20Pact\"&gt;Ebonheart Pact&lt;/a&gt; in the attempt to revive Sinmur, the Leader of the Giants. To strengthen Sinmur's ethereal body, the Worm Cult had traveled to Pinepeak Cavern to enslave Hakra's soul. Knowing that the Worm Cult would resurrect Sinmur, Jorunn sent an entourage of scholars to the sight, only to be attacked by the Worm Cult and forced to retreat outside the cavern. Luckily, &lt;a href=\"Netapatuu\"&gt;Netapatuu&lt;/a&gt; had acquired a shard that contained a little bit of Hakra's soul. With this shard, an &lt;a href=\"Vestige\"&gt;Elite Agent&lt;/a&gt; of the Pact was able to thwart the Worm Cult within Pinepeak Cavern and recover the spirit of Hakra. Hakra would aid the Ebonheart Pact in their battle against Sinmur and &lt;a href=\"Thallik%20Wormfather\"&gt;Thallik Wormfather&lt;/a&gt;.\n&lt;a href=\"Fourth%20Era\"&gt;Fourth Era&lt;/a&gt;.\nAs time went on, Hakra and the Ebonheart Pact was able to defeat Sinmur, ascending into &lt;a href=\"Sovngarde%20%28Location%29\"&gt;Sovngarde&lt;/a&gt; with &lt;a href=\"Valdur\"&gt;Valdur&lt;/a&gt; and the rest of the &lt;a href=\"Five%20Hundred%20Companions\"&gt;Five Hundred Companions&lt;/a&gt;, leaving the tomb at Pinepeak Cavern empty, without a soul entombed. The only beings inhabiting Pinepeak Cavern would be the creatures of the Rift. Eventually, the caves collapsed on themselves, sealing a large majority of the cave, save for the den at the entrance. Various animals have taken refuge in the cave such as the &lt;a href=\"Bear\"&gt;Bear&lt;/a&gt;, using it as their home. Occasionally, the bears of Pinepeak would terrorize nearby settlements, prompting &lt;a href=\"the%20Companions\"&gt;the Companions&lt;/a&gt; to take action and eliminate the threat."}

An easy way to get to Pinewatch is to head directly west from &lt;a href=\"Helgen\"&gt;Helgen&lt;/a&gt;. There is a &lt;a href=\"Bandits%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;bandit&lt;/a&gt; watchtower with a double rock fall trap just to the south of the house.\nIt is also near &lt;a href=\"Lakeview%20Manor\"&gt;Lakeview Manor&lt;/a&gt;.\nPinewatch.\nOn first inspection, Pinewatch appears to be an ordinary farmhouse with crops growing out back. The door is locked and, surprisingly, it is untouched by all the bandit activity in the area. The house itself is typical Nordic style, with a single large room and stairs leading to the basement. There is a secret passage in the basement that is opened by pressing a button to the right of the empty bookshelf on the lower level of the building. If the &lt;a href=\"Last%20Dragonborn\"&gt;Dragonborn&lt;/a&gt; bribes &lt;a href=\"Rhorlak%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Rhorlak&lt;/a&gt; in this farmhouse during the \"&lt;a href=\"Silver%20Lining\"&gt;Silver Lining&lt;/a&gt;\" quest, he will reveal the location of the button.\nSecret passage.\nThe secret passageway opens into a tunnel leading to a series of connected caverns. The cave system is comprised of ancient Nordic tombs and what appears to be an excavation site. Close to a dozen bandits inhabit this area in a series of chambers. It seems that a crew of bandits have slain a family of woodcutters and are using their home to ambush &lt;a href=\"Khajiit%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Khajiit&lt;/a&gt; caravans (their corpses can be found in a corner on the bottom level of the first cavern laying atop a trap door/disposal chute). The first few chambers are piled high with crates, barrels and boxes from the caravans the bandits have robbed.\nThere are several locked doors with &lt;a href=\"Potions%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;potions&lt;/a&gt; and other items behind them and chests (some locked) to open. The first is on the upper level of the first cavern. The Dragonborn will find several &lt;a href=\"Roras%27s%20Letter\"&gt;notes&lt;/a&gt; mentioning \"&lt;a href=\"Rigel%20Strong-Arm\"&gt;Rigel's&lt;/a&gt;\" well-protected treasure room.\nPinewatch Bandit's Sanctuary.\nThe sanctuary is the living quarters of the bandits. There are more tombs and caverns that have been converted into a sleeping area, kitchen/dining area and the bandit leader's room. The bandits have cleared this portion of the tomb by killing the &lt;a href=\"draugr%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;draugr&lt;/a&gt;, the remains of which litter the area. One of the locked doors here guards an &lt;a href=\"Unusual%20Gem\"&gt;Unusual Gem&lt;/a&gt; and a trapped chest (novice).\nIn the hall leading to the dining area, a &lt;a href=\"Warning\"&gt;warning note&lt;/a&gt; is stuck to the wall. The note warns the bandits to not try to sneak into the treasure room and is signed Rigel Strong-Arm.\nRigel's room.\nAfter clearing the area of more bandits the Dragonborn will make their way into Rigel's room. There are multiple bone alarms hanging around the room to alert the leader of any intrusion. The bandit leader will come out to attack, the infamous Rigel Strong-Arm. Be sure to loot her for the &lt;a href=\"Keys%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Pinewatch Key&lt;/a&gt; and Pinewatch Treasure Room Key. There is also a workbench here.\nOne can also sneak past her entirely and pick the master-level lock to the treasure room.\nTreasure room.\nThe treasure room is guarded by a master-locked door (which can be opened using Rigel's key). The next few areas are filled with multiple &lt;a href=\"Traps%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;traps&lt;/a&gt; prepared for an unwary thief. The \"bridge\" has a dart trap, followed by a hallway with a swinging blades trap, then a battering ram trap to catch anyone running through the swing blades. Further down the hall is the treasure room door which is protected by a flail trap. In front of the treasure is a less-than-subtle pressure plate, which will trigger a spear trap for those not careful. The treasure room contains an altar loaded with jewels, ingots, valuable ore, coins, two silver candlesticks and the silver mold. There is also a chest with random leveled loot nearby.\nTrivia.\nBandit 1 \"I tried to tell him that he wouldn't get past the traps, but he wouldn't listen...\"\"\nBandit 2 \"It was a stupid plan, and now Rigel's so mad she won't even let us cut him down from there!\"\"\nBandit 3 \"Aye, and she's added more traps as well...

It is encountered in the &lt;a href=\"Halls%20of%20Fabrication\"&gt;Halls of Fabrication&lt;/a&gt; after &lt;a href=\"Hunter-Killer%20Positrox\"&gt;Hunter-Killer Positrox&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Hunter-Killer%20Negatrix\"&gt;Hunter-Killer Negatrix&lt;/a&gt; have been defeated. \nSummary.\nAt the beginning of the battle, there will be three &lt;a href=\"Dwarven%20Centurion%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Dwarven Centurion&lt;/a&gt; husks found around the arena. Throughout the fight, the Pinnacle Factotum will slowly reanimate these husks with an electric charge. The centurions spawned here will have slightly different attacks than the centurions found in the rest of the game. Once the Pinnacle Factotum's health drops below 40%, another centurion will spawn. This enemy only uses spin attacks, and the player will take magicka and stamina damage from this as well. \nWhen the Pinnacle Factotum's health drops below 60%, &lt;a href=\"Sharpened%20Conduit\"&gt;Sharpened Conduit&lt;/a&gt;s will begin to spawn. These factotums use the Resource Drain ability, but this attack cannot be interrupted.\nDuring the fight, the four pedestals near the sides of the room will transform into levitation sigils. A player must use each one to get up to the balcony and defeat the &lt;a href=\"Refabricated%20Arquebus\"&gt;Refabricated Arquebus&lt;/a&gt;es located there. The arquebuses will not fight back, but each has a surrounding static charge which drains a moderate amount of health. The button in front of each arquebus must be used after it has been defeated, then the player must rejoin the main battle downstairs. Staying upstairs for too long is very likely to kill the player."}

The cult is known to get violent with heretics, so Lerisa will ask you to spread some heresy around town, so that her sister will see how her cult treats you. Lerisa will suggest spreading the word of Boethiah until you get arrested.\nThere are four initiates who need to be spoken to. &lt;a href=\"Initiate%20Ranius\"&gt;Initiate Ranius&lt;/a&gt;, in front of the &lt;a href=\"Chapel%20of%20Akatosh\"&gt;Great Chapel of Akatosh&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href=\"Initiate%20Blatta\"&gt;Initiate Blatta&lt;/a&gt;, who is located just before the maze in Kvatch. &lt;a href=\"Initiate%20Perien\"&gt;Initiate Perien&lt;/a&gt;, in the square next to the maze and in front of the Chapel, next to the fountain. &lt;a href=\"Initiate%20Genele\"&gt;Initiate Genele&lt;/a&gt;, who is located in Kvatch's main square, in front of the &lt;a href=\"Tower%20of%20Judgement\"&gt;Tower of Judgement&lt;/a&gt;.\nAfter speaking to the last initiate, Lieutenant Mervial comes out of the Tower of Judgement and heads for the Vestige, upon accepting arrest, they go into the Tower of Judgement where the sentence would be decided. When the sentence is made clear, Josseline objects and Lerisa escapes with the Vestige.\nUpon being safe, speak to Lerisa. She will tell you that Josseline left before Lerisa could talk to her. Lerisa thinks she is off to one of the four shrines to Akatosh along &lt;a href=\"Varen%27s%20Wall%20%28Location%29\"&gt;Varen's Wall&lt;/a&gt;, and will ask you to search there. \nAt the first two shrines, you will find people who tell you they have not seen Josseline. At the third shrine, Lieutenant Mervial ambushes the Vestige. The Vestige can choose to kill Mervial or not.\nJosseline will be found at the fourth shrine you visit. She will at first think you are out to kill her because you are a Boethiah worshipper, but she will lower her guard after talking to her. Lerisa will then show up and talk to Josseline; talk to Lerisa to finish the quest.\nJournal.\nThe pirate captain Crafty Lerisa has come to Kvatch to convince her sister, Josseline, to abandon the &lt;a href=\"Society%20of%20the%20Dragon\"&gt;Society of the Dragon&lt;/a&gt;, a cult headed by the Grand Chanter of the Akatosh Cathedral for believers not ready to commit to the priesthood.\nCrafty Lerisa wants me to spread the word of Boethiah in front of initiates of the Society of the Dragon. She thinks if I spout enough heresy, I'll get arrested and show her sister just how bad this Akatosh cult really is.\nI guess my efforts have been successful. An officer from the &lt;a href=\"Order%20of%20the%20Hour%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Order of the Hour&lt;/a&gt; has come to scold me for blasphemy. I suppose I should talk to her.\nI arrived in Grand Chanter Surus's private chamber. I need to see what the Grand Chanter decides to do to determine if this Society of the Dragon is as bad as Crafty Lerisa claims.\nJosseline and I got to see just how bloodthirsty the Grand Chanter really is. But before I could deal with him, Crafty Lerisa revealed herself and spirited us out of the chamber. I should talk to her.\nCrafty Lerisa suspects that her sister Josseline fled to one of the old Akatosh shrines along Varen's Wall. We decided to split up and search for her among the shrines.\nI found Josseline at one of the old Akatosh shrines. Now to convince her to wait until Crafty Lerisa arrives.\nJosseline and Crafty Lerisa have a lot to talk about. I should ask Crafty Lerisa if she needs anything else from me before I leave them to it."}

First, the region's inhabitants banded together to build &lt;a href=\"Varen%27s%20Wall%20%28Location%29\"&gt;Varen's Wall&lt;/a&gt;, as discussed in greater detail in my treatise of the same name. The protective boundary basically separated the Gold Coast from the &lt;a href=\"Colovian%20Highlands\"&gt;Colovian Highlands&lt;/a&gt; and served to keep the area safe from Imperial retaliation and other external threats. Second, the region took advantage of the rebellion to declare its independence from &lt;a href=\"Cyrodiil%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Cyrodiil&lt;/a&gt;. These two events established the Gold Coast as an isolated haven from the troubles that plague the rest of the continent - but not without setting up challenges of a different sort.\nIn &lt;a href=\"2E%20577\"&gt;2E 577&lt;/a&gt;, just as the last stones were being places to complete Varen's Wall and the &lt;a href=\"Imperial%20Navy\"&gt;Imperial Navy&lt;/a&gt; was away dealing with the rebellion taking place to the north and east, a fleet of merchant warships and pirate vessels sailed into &lt;a href=\"Anvil%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Anvil&lt;/a&gt; harbor. A white flag adorned with a red saber flew over each ship. Led by &lt;a href=\"Fortunata%20ap%20Dugal\"&gt;Fortunata ap Dugal&lt;/a&gt;, a shipping magnate in the &lt;a href=\"Gold%20Coast%20Trading%20Company%20%28Faction%29\"&gt;Gold Coast Trading Company&lt;/a&gt;, the fleet took control of the docks and disembarked a company of sailors and pirate warriors that quickly overpowered the remaining troops loyal to the &lt;a href=\"Ephrem%20Benirus\"&gt;Imperial Prefect&lt;/a&gt;. In less than a day, Fortunata had taken control of Anvil, named herself Provincial Governor, and declared that the Gold Coast was now a free and independent state - from the &lt;a href=\"Abecean%20Sea\"&gt;Abecean Sea&lt;/a&gt; to Varen's Wall.\nThe self-proclaimed Provincial Governor, better known as the Pirate Queen to friends and enemies alike, used her connections as a high-ranking merchant lord of the Gold Coast Trading Company to build her base of power. She promised the pirates a safe haven and a share of wealth pouring though the region in exchange for their backing and support. The pirates, along with the merchant marines that had always been more loyal to Fortunata than to the company that employed them, gave the Pirate Queen the weapons she needed to take and maintain control of Anvil and the surrounding countryside.\nIn many ways, the truth is almost more unbelievable than the risque and outlandish adventure tales now appearing as broadsheets on the streets of Anvil. These bawdy stories follow the exploits of the barely fictitious Pirate Empress Thusa ap Lagud, and they've become quite popular. The actual Pirate Queen tolerates the tales, if now actively encouraging their publication on a regular basis.\nNow the blood-red sabers on fields of white fly above &lt;a href=\"Anvil%20%28Online%29%23Anvil%20Castle\"&gt;Castle Anvil&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Anvil%20Lighthouse%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Anvil Lighthouse&lt;/a&gt;, and the Pirate Queen has turned Anvil into a \"Free City.\" No military vessels from any alliance are allowed to approach the Anvil Docks. Instead, merchant ships from across &lt;a href=\"Tamriel\"&gt;Tamriel&lt;/a&gt; fill the wharf, happy to buy and sell cargo at bargain prices. Even the once-proud and influential Gold Coast Trading Company has acquiesced to the Pirate Queen's demands, deciding that profit is more important that arguing over respectability and who's in charge. In effect, the company does what the Pirate Queen tells it to.\nIt doesn't take a prophet to predict that the Pirate Queen has her sights set on Anvil's neighbor to the northeast, &lt;a href=\"Kvatch%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Kvatch&lt;/a&gt;. She said as much in her much-publicized declaration of Independence. With more pirates and buccaneers rallying to her flag every day, and with gold flowing from frightened nobles as protection money disguised as taxes, it's clear to see that Fortunata will soon have the resources to deal with &lt;a href=\"Count%20Carolus\"&gt;Count Carolus&lt;/a&gt; and even &lt;a href=\"Primate%20Artorius\"&gt;Primate Artorius&lt;/a&gt;. It's just a matter of time. And the Pirate Queen has demonstrated over and over again that she can be very patient when it comes to letting her plans develop.\nBy all accounts, Fortunata rules Anvil with an iron fist. The Red Sails pirates serve as her private army, raiding, rampaging, and performing the duties of enforcers whenever and wherever she directs them. She may be a cruel and merciless dictator, but she keeps the region under control and prevents anarchy from running rampart. Can we really expect more than that from our rulers?"}

She eyed the pirate sloop's torn sails and broken mast. Not only had their most recent haul washed overboard, but now they'd be becalmed until they could afford repairs.\n\"We're as good as grounded,\" First Mate Huruz said grimly.\n\"If we see another ship, I'm sure we can talk them out of it,\" the captain replied with a throaty chuckle. \"We're disabled, but still afloat. You're always thinking about disasters.\"\n\"Better safe than \u2026 is that another ship?\"\nSaraja turned and grinned. \"Our future ship, you mean.\"\nHuruz eyed the distance and said thoughtfully, \"It's not that far. Let's lower the dinghy.\"\nWithin moments, the &lt;a href=\"Khajiit%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Khajiiti&lt;/a&gt; crew prepared themselves to row to the other vessel. It was anchored near a sandbar and appeared undamaged. As they approached, Saraja scanned the line between the ship and sky, looking for movement. All quiet. Ripe for the plunder.\nHuruz climbed up, slowly digging into the ship's dark hull. He had to overpower any guard on this side, enabling the rest of the crew to secure lines and board. Landing softly on the deck, Huruz glanced quickly fore and aft. No guards. He leaned over the rail and signaled the crew.\nOne by one, the pirates boarded, padding along the deck silently with weapons drawn until they were all aboard the silent ship. \"Too big a ship to be on a pleasure cruise,\" Huruz murmured to the captain. \"And too quiet to be well-armed.\"\nSaraja nodded, gesturing toward the cabin's door. \"They're hiding in there,\" she whispered. \"Time for them to get off my ship.\"\nWith a loud battle cry, Huruz kicked open the cabin door. The pirates, claws unsheathed and weapons high, pushed in after him before coming to a stop not ten paces into the quiet, dark space.\n\"What's amiss?\"\n\"Quick! Get me a light!\"\nOne of the pirates slammed tinder and flint together. He raised the torch slowly, its warm glow reflecting across dozens of mirrors strewn throughout the cabin.\n\"By &lt;a href=\"Jone\"&gt;Jone&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Jode\"&gt;Jode&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Kothringi\"&gt;Kothringi&lt;/a&gt;!\"\n\"Dead Kothringi!\"\nSaraja ordered everyone back to their crippled ship, though it was already too late. No one who'd seen the &lt;a href=\"Crimson%20Ship\"&gt;Crimson Ship&lt;/a&gt; ever lived to tell the tale, and her crew had done more than see it."}

Solitude has been known as a flourishing metropolis within the blessed arms of the Empires of &lt;a href=\"Cyrodiil\"&gt;Cyrodiil&lt;/a&gt;, having ties with the &lt;a href=\"Septim%20Empire\"&gt;Septim Empire&lt;/a&gt; especially.\nDescription.\nGeography.\nComparatively, Solitude is one of the biggest cities in the province of Skyrim and is built on a very peculiar landscape. Solitude was built on a rather large arch on top of the &lt;a href=\"Karth%20River\"&gt;Karth River Estuary&lt;/a&gt;, where the river meets the &lt;a href=\"Sea%20of%20Ghosts\"&gt;Sea of Ghosts&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Drajkmyr%20Marsh\"&gt;Drajkmyr Marsh&lt;/a&gt; located in &lt;a href=\"Hjaalmarch\"&gt;Hjaalmarch&lt;/a&gt;. The area where Solitude is not flat, rather on the edge of the &lt;a href=\"Mount%20Kilkreath\"&gt;Kilkreath Highlands&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;a href=\"Druadach%20Mountains\"&gt;Druadach Mountains&lt;/a&gt;. Lower Solitude consists of the port and the main headquarters of the &lt;a href=\"East%20Empire%20Company\"&gt;East Empire Company&lt;/a&gt;, the Third Empire's major trading company. The central warehouse is vast and can house several trading ships. The road to the northernmost point of Haafingar goes directly over the warehouse water entrance and underneath the grand arch of Solitude. The &lt;a href=\"Katla%27s%20Farm\"&gt;local stables&lt;/a&gt; of Solitude is located in between the ports and the road leading into the central city. Solitude's outer gate is heavily fortified with the &lt;a href=\"Sky%20Tower\"&gt;Sky Tower&lt;/a&gt; being the first line of defense for the city.\nUpper Solitude is divided into three separate districts, each with unique distinctions and serving different purposes. The Merchant's District, or the Well District, in West Solitude is home to several local businesses as well as the main gate of Solitude. &lt;a href=\"The%20Winking%20Skeever\"&gt;The Winking Skeever&lt;/a&gt; is one of the more successful inns located in Solitude, due to its convenient location being near the main gate and the town square. Southeast of the inn is the town square, where various smaller businesses gather to sell their daily catch of fish or their signature wines. The &lt;a href=\"Radiant%20Raiment%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Radiant Raiment&lt;/a&gt; specializes in selling the most exquisite clothing for nobles of the &lt;a href=\"Third%20Empire\"&gt;Third Empire&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Kingdom%20of%20Solitude\"&gt;Kingdom of Solitude&lt;/a&gt;. The area called &lt;a href=\"Castle%20Dour\"&gt;Castle Dour&lt;/a&gt; is where the military forces of Solitude reside as well as the &lt;a href=\"Temple%20of%20the%20Divines%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Temple of the Divines&lt;/a&gt;. The &lt;a href=\"Imperial%20Legion\"&gt;Imperial Legion&lt;/a&gt; of Skyrim is currently stationed in Castle Dour. The Temple of the Divines in Solitude is perhaps the biggest temple of the divines in Skyrim, with shrines dedicated to each of the &lt;a href=\"Nine%20Divines\"&gt;Nine Divines&lt;/a&gt;. The Blue Palace and a number of homes occupy the Avenues District.\nHistory.\n&lt;a href=\"First%20Era\"&gt;First Era&lt;/a&gt;.\nOlaf the Betrayer &amp; Svaknir's Vendetta.\nSometime during the &lt;a href=\"War%20of%20Succession\"&gt;War of Succession&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Olaf%20One-Eye\"&gt;Olaf One-Eye&lt;/a&gt; fought the dragon named &lt;a href=\"Numinex\"&gt;Numinex&lt;/a&gt; and defeated him on the summit of &lt;a href=\"Mount%20Anthor\"&gt;Mount Anthor&lt;/a&gt;. Olaf was able to end the War by becoming the &lt;a href=\"High%20King\"&gt;High King&lt;/a&gt; and conquering the other cities to quell the conflict and establish his reign. Solitude was the last city to fall to Olaf's Armada. Details of the siege of Solitude are currently unknown, but it left a terrible taste for the &lt;a href=\"Bards%20College\"&gt;Bards College&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Kingdom%20of%20Solitude\"&gt;Kingdom of Solitude&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href=\"Svaknir\"&gt;Svaknir&lt;/a&gt; was a notable bard from Solitude who wrote a rather scathing poem about the rise of Olaf One-Eye, which caused a vendetta with the High King and ultimately lead to his. The aftermath of the battle created a tradition in Solitude called the &lt;a href=\"Burning%20of%20King%20Olaf\"&gt;Burning of King Olaf&lt;/a&gt;, which occurs on every 14th of &lt;a href=\"Calendar\"&gt;Hearthfire&lt;/a&gt;. The tradition has been going on for years and into the fourth era.\n&lt;a href=\"Second%20Era\"&gt;Second Era&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe Kingdom of Western Skyrim &amp; King Svartr.\nDuring the reign of the &lt;a href=\"Versidue%20Shaie\"&gt;Akaviri Potentate&lt;/a&gt;, the city of Solitude was under the rule of &lt;a href=\"Svartr\"&gt;Jarl Svartr&lt;/a&gt; who was well-respected among the other Jarls of Skyrim. When &lt;a href=\"High%20King\"&gt;High King&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Logrolf\"&gt;Logrolf&lt;/a&gt; was assassinated, many people felt that &lt;a href=\"Freydis\"&gt;Freydis&lt;/a&gt;, the daughter of Logrolf should become the &lt;a href=\"High%20Queen\"&gt;High Queen&lt;/a&gt; of Skyrim and the &lt;a href=\"Crown%20of%20Verity\"&gt;Crown of Verity&lt;/a&gt; chose her. However, Svartr claimed that Freydis was an illegitimate heir to the throne and that a &lt;a href=\"Moot\"&gt;Moot&lt;/a&gt; was needed to choose the proper leader. The Crown of Verity has always been the deciding factor for the High King, ever since the reign of &lt;a href=\"Olaf%20One-Eye\"&gt;Olaf One-Eye&lt;/a&gt; and the aftermath of the &lt;a href=\"War%20of%20Succession\"&gt;War of Succession&lt;/a&gt;. The Moot chose Svartr to be the next High King, which led to Skyrim becoming divided into two separate kingdoms under the two chosen leaders. The Nords of &lt;a href=\"West%20Skyrim\"&gt;West Skyrim&lt;/a&gt; followed Svartr and formed the Western Kingdom of Skyrim. Svartr's rule would bring about trouble; one such instance was with the rising power of &lt;a href=\"Yashnag%27s%20Chiefdom\"&gt;Yashnag's Chiefdom&lt;/a&gt;, found in &lt;a href=\"Western%20Falkreath\"&gt;Western Falkreath&lt;/a&gt;. It was quelled by &lt;a href=\"Hakkvild%20Yashnag-Slayer\"&gt;Hakkvild Yashnag-Slayer&lt;/a&gt;, who drove them back into &lt;a href=\"Wrothgar\"&gt;Wrothgar&lt;/a&gt;. Svartr's dynasty ruled from the city of Solitude, which is considered the Capital of Western Skyrim.\n&lt;a href=\"Third%20Era\"&gt;Third Era&lt;/a&gt;.\nEnter Potema Septim; the Wolf-Queen.\nDuring the reign of &lt;a href=\"Uriel%20Septim%20II\"&gt;Uriel Septim II&lt;/a&gt;, the city of Solitude was under the rule of &lt;a href=\"King%20Mantiarco\"&gt;King Mantiarco&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Queen%20Amodetha\"&gt;Queen Amodetha&lt;/a&gt;, who had a child named &lt;a href=\"Prince%20Bathorgh\"&gt;Prince Bathorgh&lt;/a&gt;. When Amodetha passed away relations between the &lt;a href=\"Kingdom%20of%20Solitude\"&gt;Kingdom of Solitude&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Septim%20Empire\"&gt;Septim Empire&lt;/a&gt; began to wane, especially after Uriel II took a loan from Mantiarco to quell a rebellion in the city of &lt;a href=\"Torval\"&gt;Torval&lt;/a&gt;. To compensate, Uriel II forced &lt;a href=\"Potema%20Septim\"&gt;Potema Septim&lt;/a&gt;, a young Septim at the age of fourteen, to wed to Mantiarco, much to her dismay. When Potema became the Queen of Solitude, she faced opposition from the Old Nordic Houses and had a strained relation with Prince Bathorgh. Regardless, Potema made valuable allies including &lt;a href=\"Lord%20Vhokken\"&gt;Lord Vhokken&lt;/a&gt; and further instated her rule over Solitude.\nAt the age of fourteen, Potema gave birth to &lt;a href=\"Uriel%20Septim%20III\"&gt;Uriel Septim III&lt;/a&gt;, who was named after her late grandfather. Shortly after Uriel's birth, Bathorgh had completed the &lt;a href=\"Tournament%20of%20Stamina\"&gt;Tournament of Stamina&lt;/a&gt; and was awaiting the ceremony to crown him the victor. However, it was revealed that Bathorgh was not a descendant of Mantiarco. Amodetha had an affair with &lt;a href=\"Lord%20Thone\"&gt;Lord Thone&lt;/a&gt;, an affair which ultimately led to his death and Bathorgh's banishment from Solitude. Uriel II had passed away sometime after Potema's wedding, bringing Potema's father, &lt;a href=\"Pelagius%20Septim%20II\"&gt;Pelagius Septim II&lt;/a&gt; into power as the Emperor of Tamriel. He would pass away, possibly via poison, and &lt;a href=\"Antiochus%20Septim\"&gt;Antiochus Septim&lt;/a&gt;, Potema's brother, ascended to the throne. Mantiarco would eventually pass away from old age.\nPotema's feud with Antiochus &amp; War of the Isle.\nPotema was given an amulet from her mother, &lt;a href=\"Quintilla\"&gt;Queen Quintilla&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"Camlorn\"&gt;Camlorn&lt;/a&gt; which has a &lt;a href=\"soul%20gem\"&gt;soul gem&lt;/a&gt; infused with the spirit of a demon &lt;a href=\"werewolf\"&gt;werewolf&lt;/a&gt;. Wearing it gave Potema the ability to charm those she spoke to. Potema entered Antiochus' bedchamber in the &lt;a href=\"Blue%20Palace\"&gt;Blue Palace&lt;/a&gt; where he had just fornicated with an &lt;a href=\"Argonian\"&gt;Argonian&lt;/a&gt; wench. Potema planned to blackmail Antiochus with a letter saying that Antiochus knew his father was not Pelagius II, but a steward, making him a false heir to the throne. Potema would make the letter public if Antiochus did not step down as the Emperor. However, Antiochus was more clever than Potema anticipated and instead showed a practice sheet where Potema tried to mimic Antiochus' handwriting. Potema's attempt in blackmailing Antiochus had failed, but she was determined in becoming the Empress of the Empire.\nWith the death of Mantiarco, Uriel III assumed the throne of Solitude. For nine years Potema ruled as Uriel's regent and guided him through his reign as the King of Solitude. Potema's influence spread beyond the &lt;a href=\"Kingdom%20of%20Solitude\"&gt;Kingdom of Solitude&lt;/a&gt;, by befriending the Kings of Skyrim as well as the Kingdoms of &lt;a href=\"High%20Rock\"&gt;High Rock&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Morrowind\"&gt;Morrowind&lt;/a&gt;, with essential friendships with &lt;a href=\"Ebonheart\"&gt;Ebonheart&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Farrun\"&gt;Farrun&lt;/a&gt;. With the power of her amulet, she was able to start a war between &lt;a href=\"King%20Orgnum\"&gt;King Orgnum&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"Pyandonea\"&gt;Pyandonea&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Psijic%20Order\"&gt;Psijic Order&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"Artaeum\"&gt;Artaeum&lt;/a&gt; under &lt;a href=\"Loremaster%20Celarus\"&gt;Loremaster Celarus&lt;/a&gt;. This conflict was known as the &lt;a href=\"War%20of%20the%20Isle\"&gt;War of the Isle&lt;/a&gt; and it crippled the Pyandonean Armada. In &lt;a href=\"3E%20112\"&gt;3E 112&lt;/a&gt;, Emperor Antiochus passed away through unknown circumstances, coincidentally, when Potema and Uriel III visited the &lt;a href=\"Imperial%20City%20Palace\"&gt;Imperial City Palace&lt;/a&gt; and Emperor Antiochus.\nWar of the Red Diamond; Kintyra Septim II.\nWith Emperor Antiochus' demise, &lt;a href=\"Kintyra%20Septim%20II\"&gt;Kintyra Septim II&lt;/a&gt;, Antiochus' daughter, would rise to power and become the Empress of Tamriel, much to the dismay of Potema. Potema traveled to Kintyra's Coronation and gave a very infamous speech. In her speech, she praised the late emperor but denounced the &lt;a href=\"Elder%20Council\"&gt;Elder Council&lt;/a&gt; and named Kintyra II a bastard and an illegitimate heir to the throne. She was later banned from the &lt;a href=\"Imperial%20City\"&gt;Imperial City&lt;/a&gt; and mustered a rebellion from the Kingdom of Solitude with the support of the kingdoms she had allied with throughout the years. This conflict would be called the &lt;a href=\"War%20of%20the%20Red%20Diamond\"&gt;War of the Red Diamond&lt;/a&gt;, the early stages of the war were fought throughout Skyrim, High Rock,\nand Northern &lt;a href=\"Cyrodiil\"&gt;Cyrodiil&lt;/a&gt;.\nKintyra II received a distress signal from &lt;a href=\"Mentin\"&gt;Mentin&lt;/a&gt;, the Duke of &lt;a href=\"Glenpoint\"&gt;Glenpoint&lt;/a&gt;, and went there personally to discuss the issue. She traveled into the &lt;a href=\"Dragontail%20Mountains\"&gt;Dragontail Mountains&lt;/a&gt; and eventually the &lt;a href=\"Barony%20of%20Dwynnen\"&gt;Barony of Dwynnen&lt;/a&gt;, to reach the &lt;a href=\"March%20of%20Glenpoint\"&gt;March of Glenpoint&lt;/a&gt;, located northeast of &lt;a href=\"Daggerfall\"&gt;Daggerfall&lt;/a&gt; and north of &lt;a href=\"Reich%20Gradkeep\"&gt;Reich Gradkeep&lt;/a&gt;. Through the perilous blizzards of the north, Kintyra II reached Castle Glenpoint on the 23rd of &lt;a href=\"Frostfall\"&gt;Frostfall&lt;/a&gt;. Unfortunately, her militia was ambushed by Potema's supporters, and she was imprisoned inside Castle Glenpoint. Duke Mentin was working with Potema and used the distress call to bait Kintyra into a trap. Kintyra II would be executed within Castle Glenpoint, causing &lt;a href=\"Cephorus%20Septim\"&gt;Cephorus Septim&lt;/a&gt; to be crowned the next emperor. The war continued and soon the tides turned, and the battlefront pushed towards the Kingdom of Solitude and Skyrim. Each and ever ally that Potema had mustered began to leave this dying cause, leaving Potema's forces to dwindle.\nThe Fall of Potema; Enter Pelagius the Mad.\nThe final battles during the War of the Red Diamond were the start of Potema's demise. The &lt;a href=\"Battle%20of%20Falconstar\"&gt;Battle of Falconstar&lt;/a&gt; was one of the few battles that Potema won. Potema and Lord Vhokken were able to subdue &lt;a href=\"Magnus%20Septim\"&gt;Magnus Septim&lt;/a&gt;'s army, who were positioned in &lt;a href=\"Kogmenthist%20Castle\"&gt;Kogmenthist Castle&lt;/a&gt; and secure that area of the war. However, the &lt;a href=\"Battle%20of%20Ichidag\"&gt;Battle of Ichidag&lt;/a&gt; was a failure for Solitude, Uriel III's forces were defeated in the &lt;a href=\"Hammerfell\"&gt;Hammerfell&lt;/a&gt; countryside and was taken to the city of &lt;a href=\"Gilane\"&gt;Gilane&lt;/a&gt;, to be put on trial by the Court of Gilane. However, a riot manifested in Gilane, where the main objective was to kill Uriel III. Uriel was killed amidst the mob, in a burning fire. After the victory over Falconstar, Potema received the news prior and did not think of it. Retreating into Solitude, Potema had practically lost all of her allies, resorting to using &lt;a href=\"Necromancy\"&gt;Necromancy&lt;/a&gt; to have warriors on her side. She had become an old withered witch who had nothing but a ruined keep, and the amulet her mother Quintilla gave her.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Siege%20of%20Solitude\"&gt;Siege of Solitude&lt;/a&gt; had left the Kingdom of Solitude ransacked and desolate. Cephorus and Magnus' armies were besieging the city, and the War of the Red Diamond was soon coming to an end. Inner Solitude, towards &lt;a href=\"Castle%20Solitude\"&gt;Castle Solitude&lt;/a&gt; has become a battlefield while the Well's District of Solitude is slowly redeveloping. &lt;a href=\"Pelagius%20Septim%20III\"&gt;Pelagius Septim III&lt;/a&gt; was wandering the streets of Solitude and arrived into the Solitude Mages Guild. There, an old lady approaches Pelagius III, complementing his young looks and giving him a strange amulet. Pelagius III gladly took the amulet and wore around his neck, while the old lady vanished into the alley. The old lady was Potema Septim, and she returned to her quarters where she died with a toothless grin on her face. Solitude was captured, and the War had finally ended. Pelagius III would assume the throne as the King of Solitude.\nThe Story of Pelagius Septim III.\nBorn in the city of &lt;a href=\"Wayrest\"&gt;Wayrest&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"3E%20119\"&gt;3E 119&lt;/a&gt;, Thoriz Pelagius Septim was pampered by his family, being the son of Magnus Septim, who was considered Antiochus Septim's favorite brother. His first ten years of his life has been chaos since Antiochus had passed, Kintyra II assumed the throne and the War of the Red Diamond ravaged the Empire. His first battle was the Siege of Solitude, and it was there he acquired an estranged amulet from an old woman. After the siege, Pelagius III assumed the throne as the King of Solitude. Magnus and Cephorus I fought Uriel III and Potema at Wayrest, having his family be relocated to the &lt;a href=\"Isle%20of%20Balfiera\"&gt;Isle of Balfiera&lt;/a&gt; where his mother, &lt;a href=\"Utheilla%20Direnni\"&gt;Utheilla Direnni&lt;/a&gt; was from. Pelagius III's earliest reign as the King of Solitude, was when his mind began to deteriorate, revealing forms of madness. He would have visitors from as far as &lt;a href=\"Ebonheart\"&gt;Ebonheart&lt;/a&gt; to even &lt;a href=\"Firsthold\"&gt;Firsthold&lt;/a&gt;. Diplomats commented on his personality and his general being by mentioning his \"a hale and hearty soul,\" and \"a hand grip like a skeleton.\"\nStories of Pelagius the Mad &amp; his downfall.\nAs time went on, Pelagius III's madness began to show indeed when he would lock the princes and princesses of &lt;a href=\"Silvenar%20%28City%29\"&gt;Silvenar&lt;/a&gt; in their rooms and shove a declaration of war under their door. He would also tear off his clothes in public gatherings like festivals and say jarring speeches. By order of Magnus Septim, Pelagius III married &lt;a href=\"Katariah%20Ra%27athim\"&gt;Katariah Ra'athim&lt;/a&gt;, a beautiful &lt;a href=\"Dark%20Elf\"&gt;Dark Elf&lt;/a&gt; from the city of Ebonheart. The reason for this marriage was to establish relationships with Ebonheart, who had a very well-known allegiance with Potema Septim during the War. Katariah was a shrewd politician and governed Pelagius III's kingdom while her husband was going insane. When Cephorus died, Magnus Septim became the Emperor, but was very old and eventually passed away, leaving the throne to Pelagius III and Katariah. Pelagius' sister, &lt;a href=\"Jolethe%20Direnni\"&gt;Jolethe Direnni&lt;/a&gt; became the Queen of Solitude and managed to keep a healthy kingdom within Skyrim. By the time Pelagius III was Emperor for a couple of years, he had a wide variety of stories describing his madness. One such example is that when Pelagius III gained the crown, he fainted on throne, and Katariah had to hold him up, so people did not know he fainted.\nPelagius III's madness, made him infamous throughout the Septim Empire, giving him the name, \"Pelagius the Mad.\" He was taken to several different asylums throughout the Empire, ranging from one in &lt;a href=\"Valenwood\"&gt;Valenwood&lt;/a&gt; to another one in &lt;a href=\"Torval\"&gt;Torval&lt;/a&gt;. While in the Imperial Palace, Pelagius III would sometimes attack visitors and he would have a crazed-obsession with cleanliness. Katariah ruled in his place and proved to be an exceptional leader, easily one of the greatest ones to grace the Empire. Rumor has it that Katariah had an affair with her consort, &lt;a href=\"Gallivere%20Lariat\"&gt;Gallivere Lariat&lt;/a&gt;, who hailed from the city of &lt;a href=\"Shornhelm\"&gt;Shornhelm&lt;/a&gt;. But alas, &lt;a href=\"Cassynder%20Septim\"&gt;Cassynder Septim&lt;/a&gt;, the child of Pelagius III and Katariah assumed the Ruby Throne. Pelagius III passed away in a &lt;a href=\"Temple%20of%20Kynareth\"&gt;Temple of Kynareth&lt;/a&gt; on the Isle of &lt;a href=\"Betony\"&gt;Betony&lt;/a&gt;.\nSolitude during the Imperial Simulacrum.\nSometime during the Imperial Simulacrum, the provinces of &lt;a href=\"Valenwood\"&gt;Valenwood&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Elsweyr\"&gt;Elsweyr&lt;/a&gt; waged war against each other and it was called the &lt;a href=\"Five%20Year%20War\"&gt;Five Year War&lt;/a&gt;, which started when the &lt;a href=\"Khajiit\"&gt;Khajiit&lt;/a&gt; traders being ambushed by several &lt;a href=\"Bosmer\"&gt;Bosmer&lt;/a&gt;i warriors. The war was fought in between the regions of &lt;a href=\"Reaper%27s%20March\"&gt;Reaper's March&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Malabal%20Tor\"&gt;Malabal Tor&lt;/a&gt;, more specifically in the &lt;a href=\"Xylo%20River\"&gt;Xylo River&lt;/a&gt;. At the &lt;a href=\"Battle%20of%20Zelinin\"&gt;Battle of Zelinin&lt;/a&gt;, the Khajiit utilized Nords from Solitude to give them authentic Heavy Armor from Skyrim, which proved to be useless. The Khajiit were unable to move as much as Medium Armor, and the Bosmeri Army massacred them. After that tragedy, the Solitude diplomats were forced out of Elsweyr, and the Khajiit went back to Medium Armor, which led to their victory in the war.\nDuring the &lt;a href=\"Imperial%20Simulacrum\"&gt;Imperial Simulacrum&lt;/a&gt; from &lt;a href=\"3E%20389\"&gt;3E 389&lt;/a&gt; to &lt;a href=\"3E%20399\"&gt;3E 399&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Emperor\"&gt;Emperor&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Uriel%20Septim%20VII\"&gt;Uriel Septim VII&lt;/a&gt; was imprisoned along with &lt;a href=\"Talin%20Warhaft\"&gt;Talin Warhaft&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;a href=\"Deadlands\"&gt;Deadlands&lt;/a&gt; by &lt;a href=\"Jagar%20Tharn\"&gt;Jagar Tharn&lt;/a&gt;. Tharn planned for months to capture the throne, and he was able to achieve so in the span of ten years. Tharn had a powerful weapon called the &lt;a href=\"Staff%20of%20Chaos\"&gt;Staff of Chaos&lt;/a&gt;, and he split it into nine pieces and scattered them across Tamriel, the staff was the only thing keeping Uriel Septim and Warhaft in &lt;a href=\"Oblivion\"&gt;Oblivion&lt;/a&gt;. A warrior escaped his clutches and traveled all corners of Tamriel to retrieve the missing pieces. The hero was known as the &lt;a href=\"Eternal%20Champion\"&gt;Eternal Champion&lt;/a&gt;, and he assembled the staff and defeated Jagar Tharn at the &lt;a href=\"Imperial%20Palace\"&gt;Imperial Palace&lt;/a&gt;. The Eternal Champion had at one point visited the city of Solitude in their quest to recover the pieces. The city of Solitude was under the rule of &lt;a href=\"Queen%20Hania\"&gt;Queen Hania&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe Rise of the Horme.\nEven after the Siege of Solitude, Potema Septim influenced the Skyrim underground, in the form of a faction known as the &lt;a href=\"Horme\"&gt;Horme&lt;/a&gt;. The Horme is a terrorist organization that believed that Potema and Uriel III were the direct descendants of &lt;a href=\"Tiber%20Septim\"&gt;Tiber Septim&lt;/a&gt;. Because of what they considered an atrocity, the death of Potema, the Horme committed acts that have an Imperial interest. The cities of Southern Skyrim such as &lt;a href=\"Whiterun\"&gt;Whiterun&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Hrothgar\"&gt;Hrothgar&lt;/a&gt;, have suffered terrorist attacks by the Horme, among other things like blizzards and ravaging &lt;a href=\"Frost%20Troll\"&gt;Frost Troll&lt;/a&gt;s. This was the last time; the Horme has been mention, the only similar faction was the Witches Coven of &lt;a href=\"Wolfskull%20Cave\"&gt;Wolfskull Cave&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;a href=\"fourth%20era\"&gt;fourth era&lt;/a&gt; who tried to resurrect Potema through powerful magic.\nThe Reign of King Thian; A New Alliance.\nIn the waning years of the third era, near the &lt;a href=\"Oblivion%20Crisis\"&gt;Oblivion Crisis&lt;/a&gt;, the city of Solitude was under the control of &lt;a href=\"King%20Thian\"&gt;King Thian&lt;/a&gt; and through his reign, Solitude became an incredibly powerful kingdom, way more than it was before. Thian had the ambition to control the northern coast of Skyrim and to expand his territory to the island fiefdoms of the &lt;a href=\"Sea%20of%20Ghosts\"&gt;Sea of Ghosts&lt;/a&gt;. Thian would marry &lt;a href=\"Queen%20Macalla\"&gt;Queen Macalla&lt;/a&gt;, from the &lt;a href=\"Kingdom%20of%20Dawnstar\"&gt;Kingdom of Dawnstar&lt;/a&gt;, to further establish the relations on Northern Skyrim. Through the Thian and Macalla Alliance, Solitude garnered control over the Imperial fiefs like the Isle of &lt;a href=\"Roscrea\"&gt;Roscrea&lt;/a&gt; and other territories that &lt;a href=\"Uriel%20Septim%20V\"&gt;Uriel Septim V&lt;/a&gt; captured, before his conquest of &lt;a href=\"Akavir\"&gt;Akavir&lt;/a&gt;. Thian would fund expeditionary journeys throughout the Sea of Ghosts to find more islands and to finding more settlements.\n&lt;a href=\"Fourth%20Era\"&gt;Fourth Era&lt;/a&gt;.\nTorygg of Solitude &amp; the Ulfric Situation.\nDuring the &lt;a href=\"Great%20War\"&gt;Great War&lt;/a&gt; from &lt;a href=\"4E%20171\"&gt;4E 171&lt;/a&gt; to &lt;a href=\"4E%20175\"&gt;4E 175&lt;/a&gt;, the High King of Skyrim was &lt;a href=\"Istlod\"&gt;Istlod&lt;/a&gt;, who ruled from the city of Solitude rather than the city of &lt;a href=\"Winterhold%20%28City%29\"&gt;Winterhold&lt;/a&gt;, which is where the High King commonly resides. With the &lt;a href=\"Great%20Collapse\"&gt;Great Collapse&lt;/a&gt;, the capital of Skyrim was moved to Solitude, and the High King has ruled there ever since. Istlod managed to keep the province thriving when the &lt;a href=\"Third%20Empire\"&gt;Third Empire&lt;/a&gt; suffered from the &lt;a href=\"Third%20Aldmeri%20Dominion\"&gt;Third Aldmeri Dominion&lt;/a&gt;. Istlod eventually passed away, causing a Moot to choose the next successor, that successor came in the form of his son, &lt;a href=\"Torygg\"&gt;Torygg&lt;/a&gt;. Torygg married &lt;a href=\"Elisif%20the%20Fair\"&gt;Elisif the Fair&lt;/a&gt; and ruled the province for several years until &lt;a href=\"4E%20201\"&gt;4E 201&lt;/a&gt;.\nDespite the declining power the Empire had after the Great War, Torygg was a supporter of the Empire and served them well in their time of rebuilding, but many Nords of Skyrim would soon stray from the Empire, planning to create something of their own. &lt;a href=\"Jarl\"&gt;Jarl&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Ulfric%20Stormcloak\"&gt;Ulfric Stormcloak&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"Windhelm\"&gt;Windhelm&lt;/a&gt; was heavily against the &lt;a href=\"White-Gold%20Concordat\"&gt;White-Gold Concordat&lt;/a&gt;, which banned the worship of &lt;a href=\"Talos\"&gt;Talos&lt;/a&gt;, who is considered a hero among the Nords of Skyrim. In the Moot that made Torygg the High King, Ulfric spoke about Skyrim's independence, in terms just shy of treason. Regardless of this, Torygg had high-respect towards Ulfric but feared taking on the Dominion on their own. In &lt;a href=\"4E%20201\"&gt;4E 201&lt;/a&gt;, Ulfric traveled to Solitude to gain an audience with Torygg. There is an old Nordic tradition called the &lt;a href=\"Traditional%20Nordic%20Duel\"&gt;Traditional Nordic Duel&lt;/a&gt;, where a duel is fought to determine the High King. It is never specified wether these duels are lethal or not, though in a previous duel, the bested survived. Whatever the case, Ulfric challenged Torygg to this duel and as high king, Torygg could not refuse, as it would cause for a new Moot to meet. The duel ended swiftly as Ulfric killed Torygg, by some accounts with the &lt;a href=\"Thu%27um\"&gt;Thu'um&lt;/a&gt;, by Ulfric's account, with his sword after he had shouted Torygg to the ground. Following the death of Torygg, Ulfric fled to Windhelm, and the &lt;a href=\"Skyrim%20Civil%20War\"&gt;Skyrim Civil War&lt;/a&gt; worsened.\nEchoes of the Wolf; Potema's Awakening.\nDuring the Skyrim Civil War in 4E 201, several shady figures have begun to spring up in the city of Solitude, and one such group was a &lt;a href=\"Necromancy\"&gt;Necromancy&lt;/a&gt; coven located out in &lt;a href=\"Wolfskull%20Cave\"&gt;Wolfskull Cave&lt;/a&gt;, near the township of &lt;a href=\"Dragon%20Bridge\"&gt;Dragon Bridge&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href=\"Varnius%20Junius\"&gt;Varnius Junius&lt;/a&gt; was a member of the Dragon Bridge community and traveled to gain an audience with Jarl Elisif the Fair and her &lt;a href=\"Thane%20%28Title%29\"&gt;Thane&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Falk%20Firebeard\"&gt;Falk Firebeard&lt;/a&gt;. Firebeard sent an &lt;a href=\"Last%20Dragonborn\"&gt;estranged warrior&lt;/a&gt; to investigate the weird occurrences out of the cave. It was there the warrior defeated the witches coven and banished the soul of &lt;a href=\"Potema%20Septim\"&gt;Potema Septim&lt;/a&gt; into the &lt;a href=\"Void\"&gt;Void&lt;/a&gt;, or so it would seem. Sometime later, Firebeard sent a letter to the warrior, to investigate the &lt;a href=\"Solitude%20Catacombs\"&gt;Solitude Catacombs&lt;/a&gt; about the appearance of Potema Septim. Deep in the chambers, the warrior encountered the apparition of Potema Septim, defeating her and officially sending her back to the Void, completely obliterating the threat. The warrior was said to be named the Thane of Solitude, under Elisif the Fair."}

Set upon a great stone arch that towers above the mouth of the &lt;a href=\"Karth%20River\"&gt;Karth River&lt;/a&gt;, the city is surrounded by the soaring peaks of the nearby mountains. Solitude is both a reinforced and breathtaking stronghold. It is also protected from attack from the west by the still-largely intact &lt;a href=\"Fort%20Hraggstad\"&gt;Fort Hraggstad&lt;/a&gt; overlooking the &lt;a href=\"Sea%20of%20Ghosts\"&gt;Sea of Ghosts&lt;/a&gt;.\nSolitude is also a major shipping port and important Imperial supply line. Solitude sits on a natural arch, giving its port much needed shelter from the strong winds of the &lt;a href=\"Sea%20of%20Ghosts\"&gt;Ghost Sea&lt;/a&gt;. Most of the shipping in Solitude is run by the Imperial-financed &lt;a href=\"East%20Empire%20Company\"&gt;East Empire Company&lt;/a&gt;, who have a large storage &lt;a href=\"East%20Empire%20Company%20Warehouse\"&gt;warehouse&lt;/a&gt; built into the rock beneath Solitude.\nCivil War.\nDuring &lt;a href=\"4E%20201\"&gt;4E 201&lt;/a&gt;, as the &lt;a href=\"Skyrim%20Civil%20War\"&gt;Skyrim Civil War&lt;/a&gt; rages on, Skyrim becomes a nation divided, with three of its nine holds, &lt;a href=\"The%20Pale\"&gt;The Pale&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Winterhold%20%28Skyrim%20Hold%29\"&gt;Winterhold&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"The%20Rift%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;The Rift&lt;/a&gt;, allying with &lt;a href=\"Ulfric%20Stormcloak%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Ulfric Stormcloak&lt;/a&gt;, Jarl of &lt;a href=\"Eastmarch%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Eastmarch&lt;/a&gt; Hold and &lt;a href=\"Windhelm%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Windhelm&lt;/a&gt;, and his &lt;a href=\"Stormcloaks\"&gt;Stormcloak rebels&lt;/a&gt;, while &lt;a href=\"The%20Reach%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;The Reach&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Falkreath%20Hold%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Falkreath&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Hjaalmarch\"&gt;Hjaalmarch&lt;/a&gt; remain a part of the &lt;a href=\"Third%20Empire\"&gt;Empire&lt;/a&gt;, leaving &lt;a href=\"Whiterun%20Hold\"&gt;Whiterun Hold&lt;/a&gt; neutral and middle ground between the two sides until the &lt;a href=\"Battle%20for%20Whiterun\"&gt;Battle for Whiterun&lt;/a&gt; to decide its allegiance, and Solitude serves as the center of &lt;a href=\"Imperial%20Legion%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Imperial&lt;/a&gt; power in Skyrim. Much of Solitude's coffers and supplies have been diminished and its security is becoming increasingly vulnerable with many of its &lt;a href=\"Hold%20Guard\"&gt;Hold Guard&lt;/a&gt;s conscripted to serve in the Legion's army, leaving very few to patrol the settlements within Haafingar Hold to keep them safe from threats. Jarl Elisif considers these sacrifices necessary in order to quell the rebellion and defeat Ulfric and is resigned in her belief that General Tullius will do what is best since they are so dependent on him.\nGeography.\nSolitude is located on the eastern coast of a peninsula in Haafingar, in the far northwest of Skyrim. The city is built on a cape on the mouth of the Karth River and has a port on the river itself. A large percent of Haafingar's population lives within Solitude's walls. It is also one of the northernmost cities on the mainland of &lt;a href=\"Tamriel\"&gt;Tamriel&lt;/a&gt;, second only to &lt;a href=\"Dawnstar\"&gt;Dawnstar&lt;/a&gt;.\nBards College.\nFounded during Skyrim's long &lt;a href=\"Alessia\"&gt;Alessia&lt;/a&gt;n flirtation, the &lt;a href=\"Bards%20College%20%28Skyrim%20Faction%29\"&gt;Bards College&lt;/a&gt; continues to flaunt a heretical streak, and its students are famous carousers, fittingly enough given their chosen trade.

Graduates have no trouble finding employment in noble households across Tamriel, including the restored Imperial Court in &lt;a href=\"Cyrodiil\"&gt;Cyrodiil&lt;/a&gt;, but many still choose to follow in the wandering footsteps of illustrious alumni such as &lt;a href=\"Callisos\"&gt;Callisos&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Morachellis\"&gt;Morachellis&lt;/a&gt;.

He walked very far and as he walked, a storm blew up around him. Soon, the snow was falling too heavily for Nyklas to see. He decided to wait out the blizzard in a nearby cave.\nWhile he waited, he heard a deep growl, and a snowy sabre cat emerged from the white fog of the storm! It gave a mighty roar and entered the cave. Nylkas was terrified. He had no &lt;a href=\"Weapons%20%28Online%29\"&gt;weapons&lt;/a&gt; capable of fighting such a mighty beast. He braced himself for an attack as the cat roared and growled. Then, Nylkas noticed the snowy sabre cat was limping.\nWhen he looked closer, he saw a large thorn in the cat's paw. Gathering all of his courage, instead of running from the beast, he moved closer and extracted the thorn. The snowy sabre cat roared in pain, but then relief swept through it as the agony receded.\nThe thankful cat licked Nylkas's face and hands, then curled up beside him. Later, when the storm was still too dangerous for Nylkas to venture out, the cat left and brought back game for the two to share in the warmth and safety of the cave.\nWhen the storm cleared, Nylkas and the cat emerged from the cave. From then on, they traveled together and remained lifelong friends.\nNever Talk to Strangers\nNever talk to &lt;a href=\"Reachmen\"&gt;Reachmen&lt;/a&gt;, they'll eat you in the night.\nNever talk to &lt;a href=\"Old%20Holds\"&gt;Easterners&lt;/a&gt;, they only want to fight.\nDon't say hello to &lt;a href=\"Orsimer%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Orcs&lt;/a&gt;, they always seem to smell.\nDon't say hello to &lt;a href=\"Redguards%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Redguards&lt;/a&gt;, all they do is curse and yell.\nNever speak with &lt;a href=\"Elves\"&gt;Elves&lt;/a&gt;, they are aloof, and brusk, and very rude.\nNever speak with &lt;a href=\"Imperials%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Imperials&lt;/a&gt;, they only want to share their foul mood.\nDon't make friends with &lt;a href=\"Argonians%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Argonians&lt;/a&gt;, they're cold and wet and slimy.\nDon't make friends with &lt;a href=\"Khajiit%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Khajiit&lt;/a&gt;, they'll take anything that's shiny.\nNever talk to &lt;a href=\"Bretons%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Bretons&lt;/a&gt;, they're just as bad as Elves.\nNever talk to strangers, we &lt;a href=\"Nords%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Nords&lt;/a&gt; must keep to ourselves!\nThe &lt;a href=\"Jarl\"&gt;Jarl&lt;/a&gt;'s New Robes\nThere once was a jarl who was incredibly vain. He loved his fine clothes more than anything in the world, and often neglected his duties in favor of finding and purchasing new outfits.\nOne day, two skeeving criminals calling themselves tailors made their way to the hold. They told the jarl that they could weave him exquisite clothes in the most beautiful colors and designs. The clothes they made were so spectacular, in fact, that they would be invisible to both fools and anyone unfit for the position they held.\nThe jarl insisted the tailors make him a fine outfit as quickly as possible, one fit for a jarl! He paid them handsomely and the two of them set to work. In reality, the tailors did no work at all! They asked for splendid materials like silverweave and spidersilk, but merely took them for themselves and continued to pretend they were hard at work. They asked for &lt;a href=\"Sweetroll%20%28Online%29\"&gt;sweetrolls&lt;/a&gt; and pies, and slept in lavish beds in the jarl's longhouse while they pretended to toil away.\nEventually, the jarl asked how his clothes were coming along. He sent his housecarl to check on the tailors. When the housecarl arrived, the tailors were working at empty tables! She wondered how this could be possible. The tailors asked if she liked the clothes, and if she thought the colors were beautiful. The housecarl remembered that only fools and those unfit for their post could not see the clothes. She did not think herself either, so she lied and told the tailors the clothes were the most beautiful she'd ever seen. She reported back to the jarl and assured him the clothes were fine indeed. The jarl sent the court mage and his steward to check as well, and the two of them saw nothing either, but pretended they did. They assured the jarl the outfit was spectacular.\nSoon, the tailors announced their work was complete. The jarl went to see for himself. When he arrived, he was shocked to find he saw nothing at all! The tailors displayed the empty table and asked him if he was pleased with the result. Did he like the design? The breathtaking colors? The jarl, too afraid to admit the truth, told the tailors he adored the clothes and would wear them straight away.\nHe undressed and let the tailors pantomime the act of putting his new clothes on him. They were meticulous and even secured the imaginary robe around his neck before they finished. Then, he called in his retinue to admire his new clothes. Each of them were surprised to see the jarl standing as naked as a &lt;a href=\"Horker%20%28Online%29\"&gt;horker&lt;/a&gt; before them, but all of them were too ashamed to admit this. Instead, they fawned over his clothes and all agreed they were exquisite.\nThe tailors insisted the jarl go out into the hold and display his new clothes for his people. So, he did just that. He proudly marched down the road as his people gathered. They all saw he was naked, but were too afraid to admit it, lest they be called fools or worse.\nIt wasn't until a child stepped out of the crowd and boldly exclaimed, \"The jarl is naked!\" did the crowd stop pretending. They began to laugh and point. The jarl, mortified, ran back to his longhouse \u2026 but the two so-called tailors were already gone!\nSo the jarl instead punished his housecarl, court mage, and steward for their failure to stop the jarl from making a fool of himself. He chopped off their heads personally\u2014and with a very real and solid axe."}

The main caves lead through to the final boss chamber. The final boss is level dependent, either a high level draugr or a &lt;a href=\"Dragon%20Priests%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;dragon priest&lt;/a&gt;. Beware of the two statues behind the altar, the statue on the left shoots &lt;a href=\"Fire%20Damage%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;fireballs&lt;/a&gt; while the statue on the right heals the boss.\nOnce the boss is dead, the passageway on the left leads out. Along the way, there is a leveled &lt;a href=\"Swords%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;sword&lt;/a&gt; on the right. Head back outside the cave and talk to Perth, who gives a &lt;a href=\"leveled\"&gt;leveled&lt;/a&gt; reward of ."}

{"id": "5896", "revid": "26213507", "url": "https://elderscrolls.fandom.com/wiki?curid=5896", "title": "Solstheim", "text": "Solstheim (also spelled, Soulstheim) is an island region located on the &lt;a href=\"Sea%20of%20Ghosts\"&gt;Sea of Ghosts&lt;/a&gt;, between the provinces of &lt;a href=\"Skyrim\"&gt;Skyrim&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Morrowind\"&gt;Morrowind&lt;/a&gt;. For the longest time, Solstheim held little significance until around &lt;a href=\"3E%20427\"&gt;3E 427&lt;/a&gt;, when the &lt;a href=\"East%20Empire%20Company\"&gt;East Empire Company&lt;/a&gt; began to set foot onto the land and build their colony. It has evolved since the disaster in &lt;a href=\"4E%205\"&gt;4E 5&lt;/a&gt;, when the &lt;a href=\"High%20King\"&gt;High King&lt;/a&gt; of Skyrim gave Solstheim to &lt;a href=\"Dark%20Elven\"&gt;Dark Elven&lt;/a&gt; refugees. The &lt;a href=\"Skaal\"&gt;Skaal&lt;/a&gt; Tribe of &lt;a href=\"Nords\"&gt;Nords&lt;/a&gt; have lived on Solstheim since the &lt;a href=\"Merethic%20Era\"&gt;Merethic Era&lt;/a&gt;. It is known as the \"Jewel of Absolutely Nothing.\"\nDescription.\nGeography.\n&lt;a href=\"Felsaad%20Coast\"&gt;Felsaad Coast&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe Felsaad Coast consists of the northeast of Solstheim, and it is the home of the native &lt;a href=\"Nord\"&gt;Nord&lt;/a&gt;ic population, as the &lt;a href=\"Skaal%20Village\"&gt;Skaal Village&lt;/a&gt; is located on the northeast bluffs. Much of the region has been used by the Skaal Tribe, from not only the village but the subsidiary settlement of the &lt;a href=\"Thirsk%20Mead%20Hall\"&gt;Thirsk Mead Hall&lt;/a&gt;, which was founded by a sub-group of the Skaal. The mead hall is found on the other side of the region, on the shores of &lt;a href=\"Lake%20Fjalding\"&gt;Lake Fjalding&lt;/a&gt;. Minor islands are found on the water, a notable one is the &lt;a href=\"Gyldenhul%20Barrow\"&gt;Gyldenhul Barrow&lt;/a&gt;, the ancient burial tomb of the infamous Nordic pirate, &lt;a href=\"Haknir%20Death-Brand\"&gt;Haknir Death-Brand&lt;/a&gt;. It is found on &lt;a href=\"Horker%20Island\"&gt;Horker Island&lt;/a&gt;.\n&lt;a href=\"Hirstaang%20Forest\"&gt;Hirstaang Forest&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe Hirstaang Forest consists of the southern half of Solstheim, and it is the center of the region's commerce, as the settlements of &lt;a href=\"Raven%20Rock\"&gt;Raven Rock&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Fort%20Frostmoth\"&gt;Fort Frostmoth&lt;/a&gt; are found here. Compared to the north, Hirstaang is tame, containing some minor farmlands, outside the Raven Rock walls. Fort Frostmoth was the first settlement in the land, until in &lt;a href=\"3E%20427\"&gt;3E 427&lt;/a&gt;, the township of Raven Rock was founded. When the &lt;a href=\"Red%20Year\"&gt;Red Year&lt;/a&gt; occurred, the sudden ashstorms had practically destroyed the Hirstaang Forest. Fort Frostmoth was swallowed by the ash, and thanks to &lt;a href=\"House%20Redoran\"&gt;House Redoran&lt;/a&gt;, Raven Rock was able to survive, barely. Dead trees currently riddle the landscape, a shell of its former self.\n&lt;a href=\"Isinfier%20Plains\"&gt;Isinfier Plains&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe Isinfier Plains of Solstheim takes the central east of the island, found between the Hirstaang Forest and the Felsaad Coast. The plains are largely barren, as no known settlements can be found here. Only Witches and Reavers live in this region. A small fraction of the &lt;a href=\"Glenmoril%20Witches\"&gt;Glenmoril Witches&lt;/a&gt; live in Isinfier, utilizing the &lt;a href=\"Altar%20of%20Thrond\"&gt;Altar of Thrond&lt;/a&gt; as their base of operation. Many natural caverns are found here, such as the &lt;a href=\"Cave%20of%20Hidden%20Music\"&gt;Cave of Hidden Music&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Solvjord\"&gt;Solvjord&lt;/a&gt;. In the deep forest lies &lt;a href=\"Vahlok%27s%20Tomb\"&gt;Vahlok's Tomb&lt;/a&gt;, the burial place of the ancient &lt;a href=\"Dragon%20Priest\"&gt;Dragon Priest&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Vahlok%20the%20Jailor\"&gt;Vahlok the Jailor&lt;/a&gt;, who faced the Traitor, &lt;a href=\"Miraak\"&gt;Miraak&lt;/a&gt; in the Merethic Era. Vahlok lives in Skaal culture as \"the Guardian.\"\n&lt;a href=\"Moesring%20Mountains\"&gt;Moesring Mountains&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe Moesring Mountains are the frozen wastes of Solstheim, being found in the northwest, separated by the mountain range by the same name. It is nothing but cold seas of snow, with the occasional cave system, such as &lt;a href=\"Benkongerike\"&gt;Benkongerike&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Domme\"&gt;Domme&lt;/a&gt;. The only \"settlement\" in the region is &lt;a href=\"Castle%20Karstaag\"&gt;Castle Karstaag&lt;/a&gt;, a glacier fashioned into a castle, with dining rooms and long hallways. The &lt;a href=\"Frost%20Giant\"&gt;Frost Giant&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Karstaag\"&gt;Karstaag&lt;/a&gt; lives in the castle. On the northwest, lies the &lt;a href=\"Mortrag%20Glacier\"&gt;Mortrag Glacier&lt;/a&gt;, which engulfs the entire northwest coast. By &lt;a href=\"4E%205\"&gt;4E 5&lt;/a&gt;, it was gone and more natural caves were discovered. The Dragon Lair known as &lt;a href=\"Saering%27s%20Watch\"&gt;Saering's Watch&lt;/a&gt; is found overlooking the north.\nFauna.\nRieklings &amp; Bristlebacks.\nIn Tamriel, the &lt;a href=\"Goblin\"&gt;Goblin&lt;/a&gt; is a common creature. However, areas such as &lt;a href=\"Skyrim\"&gt;Skyrim&lt;/a&gt; do not have any known Goblin tribes in their land. Solstheim has a unique variant of Goblins known as the &lt;a href=\"Riekling\"&gt;Riekling&lt;/a&gt;s, or more appropriately, Ice Goblins. Rieklings are more or less similar to their mainland counterpart, but they are much smaller and utilize makeshift spears and shields, with the former being small enough to be used as arrows by regular-sized people. According to Skaal myth, the Rieklings are descendants of the &lt;a href=\"Snow%20Elves\"&gt;Snow Elves&lt;/a&gt;, who once ruled over Skyrim. The construct redoubts throughout Northern Solstheim built out of sticks and leather. They are a constant threat of the Skaal, having at one point conquered Thirsk Mead Hall. Ruins and Caves such as &lt;a href=\"Fahlbtharz\"&gt;Fahlbtharz&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"Benkongerike\"&gt;Benkongerike&lt;/a&gt; are used by the Rieklings. While the Rieklings are known for being from Solstheim, they have roots in the mainland, and not just from the primary Goblin race. Rieklings are often seen taming the &lt;a href=\"Bristleback\"&gt;Bristleback&lt;/a&gt;, a variant of Boar that lives on Solstheim. They are known for being vicious, even to the Nords of Thirsk. They are commonly hunted for their meat, but the Rieklings use them as battle mounts.\nGrahl &amp; Udyrfrykte.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Troll\"&gt;Troll&lt;/a&gt;s of Solstheim have a distinction between them and their mainland cousins, but this more so in their appearance, or in some cases, their reputation. In the frozen north of the Moesrings lies the &lt;a href=\"Grahl\"&gt;Grahl&lt;/a&gt;, a hulking Ice Troll that has frozen spikes on their back, as well as, long white hair. They are vicious but not different than the common Troll. Like other Trolls, the Grahl has a weakness to Fire. This is due to their regenerative healing, which does not work well with burns. The Skaal have their own speculations on the Grahl, wondering whether they are evil spirits, or just simply a great beast. Their claws are said to rend armor and tear into flesh and are known to attack either alone or in a pack. By the year &lt;a href=\"4E%20201\"&gt;4E 201&lt;/a&gt; however, they no longer appear to live on the island.\nWhile the Grahl were feared by the Skaal, the &lt;a href=\"Udyrfrykte\"&gt;Udyrfrykte&lt;/a&gt; holds a much worse reputation, dating back to the original founding of the Thirsk Tribe of Nords. An Udyrfrkyte is not limited to Solstheim, but they are associated with the island. An Udyrfrykte is known to be spotted as far as the &lt;a href=\"Jerall%20Mountains\"&gt;Jerall Mountains&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Cyrodiil\"&gt;Cyrodiil&lt;/a&gt;, or &lt;a href=\"the%20Pale\"&gt;the Pale&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Skyrim\"&gt;Skyrim&lt;/a&gt;. They are formidable creatures that live in isolation. The first known Udyrfrykte was found in the early third era when the Thirsk Mead Hall was constructed. Awakened from the &lt;a href=\"Caves%20of%20Fjalding\"&gt;Caves of Fjalding&lt;/a&gt;, the Udyrfrykte wreaked havoc on the Mead Hall. In terms of appearance, the Udyrfrykte looks similar to most Trolls. The legendary beast that destroyed Thirsk was sealed back into its prison by the Nordic Wizard, &lt;a href=\"Eldrid%20Ice-Light\"&gt;Eldrid Ice-Light&lt;/a&gt;. This beast, in particular, originates from Cyrodiil, where the mother was last located.\nAsh Creatures.\n&lt;a href=\"Red%20Mountain\"&gt;Red Mountain&lt;/a&gt; on the sub-continent of &lt;a href=\"Vvardenfell\"&gt;Vvardenfell&lt;/a&gt; is the largest volcano in &lt;a href=\"Tamriel\"&gt;Tamriel&lt;/a&gt;, taking a massive portion of Vvardenfell. Even deep in the Dwarven Mines, Ash Creatures exist in the area, such as the &lt;a href=\"Ash%20Zombie\"&gt;Ash Zombie&lt;/a&gt; or the &lt;a href=\"Ash%20Vampire\"&gt;Ash Vampire&lt;/a&gt;, but when the eruption of Red Mountain, colloquially known as the &lt;a href=\"Red%20Year\"&gt;Red Year&lt;/a&gt; occurred, the district of Vvardenfell was obliterated, and surrounding areas such as Solstheim and &lt;a href=\"Stonefalls\"&gt;Stonefalls&lt;/a&gt; were heavily affected. The Hirstaang Forest of Solstheim was wrecked, leaving open ash plains where the stalwart trees once stood. With this came &lt;a href=\"Heart%20Stone\"&gt;Heart Stone&lt;/a&gt;s, which originate from Red Mountain itself, and contains traces of the power from the &lt;a href=\"Heart%20of%20Lorkhan\"&gt;Heart of Lorkhan&lt;/a&gt;. Regardless, the Heart Stones brought the inception of a creature known as the &lt;a href=\"Ash%20Spawn\"&gt;Ash Spawn&lt;/a&gt;, hulking creatures made from the bones of those that died in the Red Year, covered in layers of ash. The resurrected &lt;a href=\"Falx%20Carius\"&gt;Falx Carius&lt;/a&gt; utilized Ash Spawn as his servants, while he protected the burial stronghold of Fort Frostmoth. &lt;a href=\"Neloth\"&gt;Neloth&lt;/a&gt;, a Magister of &lt;a href=\"House%20Telvanni\"&gt;House Telvanni&lt;/a&gt; had researched the Heart Stones, coming to the conclusion we know today. With Heart Stones, Neloth was able to tame &lt;a href=\"Ash%20Guardian\"&gt;Ash Guardian&lt;/a&gt;s, who work similarly to the &lt;a href=\"Atronach\"&gt;Atronach&lt;/a&gt;s. Like with Falx Carius and &lt;a href=\"Ildari%20Sarothril\"&gt;Ildari Sarothril&lt;/a&gt;, the Heart Stones are able to resurrect people.\nLurker.\nSolstheim has held influence from the &lt;a href=\"Daedric%20Prince\"&gt;Daedric Prince&lt;/a&gt;s throughout history, considering the island's very isolated and nowhere nature. In recent years, the Daedric Prince of the Forbidden Knowledge, &lt;a href=\"Hermaeus%20Mora\"&gt;Hermaeus Mora&lt;/a&gt; has his influence featured in Solstheim through his champion, &lt;a href=\"Miraak\"&gt;Miraak&lt;/a&gt;. When the latter attempted to claim the island, his brain-washed followers built small pools around the &lt;a href=\"All-Maker%20Stones\"&gt;All-Maker Stones&lt;/a&gt;, reminiscent of the ones seen throughout the islands of &lt;a href=\"Apocrypha\"&gt;Apocrypha&lt;/a&gt;. Out of these pools appear &lt;a href=\"Lurker\"&gt;Lurker&lt;/a&gt;s, large amphibious-esque creatures that serve as guardians of the forbidden knowledge. In their home, they skulk around the winding and stretching halls, amidst the endless green sea. They spew large woads of tentacles from their mouths, spit hunks of acid, and sweep enemies with their long arms. They are quite formidable enemies and make useful bodyguards. When Miraak was defeated, the Lurkers were no longer present on Solstheim, but they are among the creatures brought forth onto the island from the planes of &lt;a href=\"Oblivion\"&gt;Oblivion&lt;/a&gt;. The &lt;a href=\"Black%20Books\"&gt;Black Books&lt;/a&gt; of Herma-Mora are still in circulation, primarily in the region of Solstheim.\nFrost Giant.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Giants\"&gt;Giants&lt;/a&gt; of Tamriel have a unique culture, and even an undiscussed history that has largely been forgotten, such as considered a sect of the original &lt;a href=\"Atmorans\"&gt;Atmorans&lt;/a&gt;, and the history surrounding &lt;a href=\"Sinmur\"&gt;Sinmur&lt;/a&gt;, the Chieftain of the Giants. Some of the most obscure creatures of Tamriel are variations of the Giants, such as the &lt;a href=\"Giantess\"&gt;Giantess&lt;/a&gt;, and the &lt;a href=\"Frost%20Giant\"&gt;Frost Giant&lt;/a&gt;s. Frost Giants are a rare group of Giants that live in the deep mountains of Tamriel, in the deep Reach, and the Moesring Mountains or Ensleth Valley of Solstheim. Frost Giants resemble a regular Giant, except for their head, which has four eyes, and large horns. They live in complete and utter isolation in the &lt;a href=\"Druadach%20Mountains\"&gt;Druadach Mountains&lt;/a&gt; or the Moesrings. Of the Frost Giants, the Giant known as &lt;a href=\"Karstaag\"&gt;Karstaag&lt;/a&gt; is the most well-known, residing in the frozen &lt;a href=\"Castle%20Karstaag\"&gt;Castle Karstaag&lt;/a&gt;, where he has several Riekling servants. Karstaag was among the greatest warriors of Solstheim that partook in the Bloodmoon Prophecy.\nFlora.\nWhile Solstheim's fauna seems unique, the flora is not so much, mirroring that seen in &lt;a href=\"Cyrodiil\"&gt;Cyrodiil&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Skyrim\"&gt;Skyrim&lt;/a&gt;, which makes sense considering its location. Southern Solstheim served as the home of both the Hirstaang Forest and the Isinfier Plains. The former is an expansive forest, filled with thickets of pine trees. Many creatures live these woods, and all Imperial-based settlements live in this area. &lt;a href=\"Belladonna%20Berries\"&gt;Belladonna Berries&lt;/a&gt; are grown here as well, and have an affinity in &lt;a href=\"Magic\"&gt;Magic&lt;/a&gt;. The Isinfier Plains is when conditions in Solstheim change between the Hirstaang, and the frozen north. All throughout the plains and even areas of Hirstaang are &lt;a href=\"Holly%20Berries\"&gt;Holly Berries&lt;/a&gt;, a widespread shrub that is used in Alchemy for their frost resistance. However, among these plants is an extremely rare plant known as the &lt;a href=\"Wolfsbane\"&gt;Wolfsbane&lt;/a&gt;, a flower that is known for its strength against &lt;a href=\"Werewolves\"&gt;Werewolves&lt;/a&gt;. Wolfsbane is used as a cure for &lt;a href=\"Lycanthropy\"&gt;Lycanthropy&lt;/a&gt;, more than just a Werewolf. Some groups such as the &lt;a href=\"Order%20of%20the%20Silver%20Dawn\"&gt;Order of the Silver Dawn&lt;/a&gt; grown them, but most people seek these plants out. The only flower grows in Solstheim, and that is on the summit of &lt;a href=\"Hvitkald%20Peak\"&gt;Hvitkald Peak&lt;/a&gt;. Wolfsbane is even made into incense, which is then used into making of Armor, one that worshippers of &lt;a href=\"Hircine\"&gt;Hircine&lt;/a&gt; typically wear. In Solstheim's south contain various landmarks, such as &lt;a href=\"Brodir%20Grove\"&gt;Brodir Grove&lt;/a&gt;, or even &lt;a href=\"Thormoor%27s%20Watch\"&gt;Thormoor's Watch&lt;/a&gt;.\nWhen the Red Year had occurred, the geography of southern Solstheim had changed drastically, one that resembles the volcanic wastes of Morrowind. All throughout the landscape, there are sights of ruined trees, even a much rarer occurrence of a &lt;a href=\"Burnt%20Spriggan\"&gt;Burnt Spriggan&lt;/a&gt;, which is self-explanatory. Instead of mighty pines, &lt;a href=\"Emperor%20Parasol\"&gt;Emperor Parasol&lt;/a&gt;s dot the landscape, along with the illustrious, &lt;a href=\"House%20Telvanni\"&gt;House Telvanni&lt;/a&gt; tower, &lt;a href=\"Tel%20Mithryn\"&gt;Tel Mithryn&lt;/a&gt;, which is made of the typical Telvanni mushroom. &lt;a href=\"Scathecraw\"&gt;Scathecraw&lt;/a&gt; had begun to grow in patches, throughout Raven Rock and the remaining forest between Isinfier and Tel Mithryn. &lt;a href=\"Ashen%20Grass%20Pod\"&gt;Ashen Grass Pod&lt;/a&gt;s are developed throughout the coast, and &lt;a href=\"Ash%20Yam\"&gt;Ash Yam&lt;/a&gt; had become minor produce in the House Redoran occupied, Raven Rock. While Southern Solstheim's climate changed, Northern Solstheim's had remained intact, sharing much of the similarities it had in 3E 427. The Isinfier Plains were only minorly affected, as it resembles a more temperate climate as seen in &lt;a href=\"Falkreath%20Hold\"&gt;Falkreath Hold&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"Wrothgar\"&gt;Wrothgar&lt;/a&gt;.\nGovernment.\nPolitical power in Solstheim has wavered throughout the years, originally a territory of Skyrim's High Kingship. This was the case throughout most of the time, except when the &lt;a href=\"Dragon%20Cult\"&gt;Dragon Cult&lt;/a&gt;, under the command of &lt;a href=\"Miraak\"&gt;Miraak&lt;/a&gt;, the first known Dragonborn. Miraak's regime was separate from the main Dragon Cult that is based in &lt;a href=\"Bromjunaar\"&gt;Bromjunaar&lt;/a&gt;. Because of the first Dragonborn's power over the Dragons, &lt;a href=\"Vahlok\"&gt;Vahlok the Guardian&lt;/a&gt; was able to subdue the Dragon Priest. The Dragon Cult that existed on Solstheim are ancestors of the &lt;a href=\"Skaal\"&gt;Skaal&lt;/a&gt;, who are the prime civilization of Solstheim. The Skaal, and later, the Thirsk Tribe are led by a Chieftain, who claim the position one way or the other. It has been this way for various years, as no other group lived in Solstheim. This changed when the &lt;a href=\"Third%20Empire\"&gt;Third Empire&lt;/a&gt; established the &lt;a href=\"East%20Empire%20Company\"&gt;East Empire Company&lt;/a&gt; and their base, &lt;a href=\"Fort%20Frostmoth\"&gt;Fort Frostmoth&lt;/a&gt; on the island. At this point, the leading figure in the EEC colony was a Factor, someone who operates trade between two points (i.e., Raven Rock and the EEC). The Imperial Legion served as a prime military force on Solstheim at this time.\nAs time went on, Raven Rock's political control shifted completely into &lt;a href=\"House%20Redoran\"&gt;House Redoran&lt;/a&gt;, one of the five &lt;a href=\"Great%20Houses\"&gt;Great Houses&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"Morrowind\"&gt;Morrowind&lt;/a&gt;. House Redoran's sphere of influence involves duty, honor, and warfare. Their focus is to maintain the traditional Dunmeri culture and the honor of oneself. House Redoran is based in the city-state of &lt;a href=\"Blacklight\"&gt;Blacklight&lt;/a&gt;, which is located in the northwest of Morrowind, near the borders that make up the &lt;a href=\"Velothi%20Mountains\"&gt;Velothi Mountains&lt;/a&gt;. Their territory expands as far as &lt;a href=\"Ald%27ruhn\"&gt;Ald'ruhn&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Silgrad%20Tower\"&gt;Silgrad Tower&lt;/a&gt;. When both the &lt;a href=\"Red%20Year\"&gt;Red Year&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Accession%20War\"&gt;Accession War&lt;/a&gt; occurred, within the span of two years, House Redoran had elevated themselves in times of need, becoming a major factor in Morrowind's political sphere. The Redoran Guard operated in Raven Rock, exclusively, while &lt;a href=\"House%20Telvanni\"&gt;House Telvanni&lt;/a&gt; has a small presence in Solstheim, via the tower of &lt;a href=\"Tel%20Mithryn\"&gt;Tel Mithryn&lt;/a&gt;. Beyond the Redoran and Telvanni, minor houses such as &lt;a href=\"House%20Sathil\"&gt;House Sathil&lt;/a&gt; (a minor house of the &lt;a href=\"Indoril\"&gt;Indoril&lt;/a&gt;) lived in the north, somewhere around the Ensleth Valley. During the Redoran's reign over Solstheim, there have been two Councilors, &lt;a href=\"Brara%20Morvayn\"&gt;Brara Morvayn&lt;/a&gt; and her son, &lt;a href=\"Lleril%20Morvayn\"&gt;Lleril Morvayn&lt;/a&gt;.\nReligion.\nThe Skaal Tribe of Nords do not follow their typical &lt;a href=\"Nordic%20Pantheon\"&gt;Nordic Pantheon&lt;/a&gt;, nor their Totemic religion as seen with the &lt;a href=\"Ancient%20Nordic%20Pantheon\"&gt;Ancient Nordic Pantheon&lt;/a&gt;. Rather, the Skaal revere a monotheistic religion surrounding the &lt;a href=\"All-Maker\"&gt;All-Maker&lt;/a&gt;. To the Skaal, the All-Maker is the source of all life and creation, the harbinger of the afterlife as all spirits eventually return to the All-Maker, who in turns, reshapes them back into the living world. The Skaal see death as another beginning. In some context, the All-Maker has parallels with &lt;a href=\"Anu\"&gt;Anu&lt;/a&gt;, who personifies these similar concepts. The antithesis to the All-Maker is &lt;a href=\"the%20Adversary\"&gt;the Adversary&lt;/a&gt;, who enjoys the tormenting the spirits, with similarities with &lt;a href=\"Padomay\"&gt;Padomay&lt;/a&gt;. In the end seasons, the Adversary would appear as &lt;a href=\"Alduin\"&gt;Thartaag the World-Devourer&lt;/a&gt;. Regardless, the All-Maker has shaped the Skaalic culture. An important Skaal belief, \"one-ness with the land,\" is an excellent summary on the Skaal, they live in harmony with nature, and only utilize the land when it is deemed fit. Skaal Tribesmen gather dead wood as firewood. They only hunt out of necessity, never for sport. There six landmarks throughout Solstheim, all known as the &lt;a href=\"All-Maker%20Stones\"&gt;All-Maker Stones&lt;/a&gt;. Each of these stones are six representations of nature (Beast, Earth, Sun, Tree, Water, Wind). In Skaalic myth, the young warrior, &lt;a href=\"Aevar%20Stone-Singer\"&gt;Aevar Stone-Singer&lt;/a&gt;, traveled to all the stones and returned their aspects to the land from the Adversary.\nEarly colonial Solstheim had little religious influence, like many Imperial strongholds in Morrowind (i.e. &lt;a href=\"Fort%20Moonmoth\"&gt;Fort Moonmoth&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Ebonheart%20%28Morrowind%29\"&gt;Castle Ebonheart&lt;/a&gt;), shrines of the &lt;a href=\"Imperial%20Cult\"&gt;Imperial Cult&lt;/a&gt; can be found in Solstheim's regional bulwark, &lt;a href=\"Fort%20Frostmoth\"&gt;Fort Frostmoth&lt;/a&gt;. The Imperial Cult are missions from the Empire to expand the teachings of the &lt;a href=\"Nine%20Divines\"&gt;Nine Divines&lt;/a&gt; in the Empire's most remote provinces. Raven Rock started off as a Mining town, meant to distribute Ebony to the Empire. Throughout the East Empire Company's control, this did not change, but when House Redoran appeared, and Raven Rock became a council seat, religion was properly integrated into Solstheim's colony. However, at this time, the worship of the &lt;a href=\"Tribunal\"&gt;Tribunal&lt;/a&gt; had diminished, and so the &lt;a href=\"House%20of%20Reclamations\"&gt;House of Reclamations&lt;/a&gt; made their rounds in Solstheim, with the establishment of the Raven Rock Temple. The House of Reclamations returns to the original Tribunal, the one before the &lt;a href=\"Battle%20of%20Red%20Mountain\"&gt;Battle of Red Mountain&lt;/a&gt;. The Good Daedra (&lt;a href=\"Azura\"&gt;Azura&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Boethiah\"&gt;Boethiah&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Mephala\"&gt;Mephala&lt;/a&gt;) were worshipped throughout the province, and the \"False\" Tribunal were made into Saints. This religion came forth when the &lt;a href=\"Dissident%20Priests\"&gt;Dissident Priests&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"Holamayan\"&gt;Holamayan&lt;/a&gt; took control over &lt;a href=\"House%20Indoril\"&gt;House Indoril&lt;/a&gt;. This has been the religion of both Morrowind, and Raven Rock ever since.\nHistory.\n&lt;a href=\"Merethic%20Era\"&gt;Merethic Era&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe Battle of the Moesring &amp; the Fall of the Snow Prince.\nIn the late Merethic Era, the &lt;a href=\"Atmorans\"&gt;Atmorans&lt;/a&gt; under &lt;a href=\"Ysgramor\"&gt;Ysgramor&lt;/a&gt; had traveled south to the modern-day lands of &lt;a href=\"Skyrim\"&gt;Skyrim&lt;/a&gt;, building their first city of &lt;a href=\"Saarthal\"&gt;Saarthal&lt;/a&gt;. However, the &lt;a href=\"Snow%20Elves\"&gt;Snow Elves&lt;/a&gt; had besieged the city and drove out the Atmorans in the event known as the &lt;a href=\"Night%20of%20Tears\"&gt;Night of Tears&lt;/a&gt;. Sometime later, Ysgramor returned to Skyrim and had begun his purge against the Snow Elves in the &lt;a href=\"Nordic-Falmer%20War\"&gt;Nordic-Falmer War&lt;/a&gt;, spanning for quite some time. The last known battle was on the region of Solstheim, in the &lt;a href=\"Battle%20of%20the%20Moesring\"&gt;Battle of the Moesring&lt;/a&gt;, the last stand of the Falmer. Leading the remaining Falmer is the &lt;a href=\"Snow%20Prince\"&gt;Snow Prince&lt;/a&gt;, the last of the Snow Elven hierarchy. Ysgramor had traveled for Solstheim after devastating the Falmer on the mainland, encountering the remnants of the Snow Elven Army at the &lt;a href=\"Moesring%20Mountains\"&gt;Moesring Mountains&lt;/a&gt; in the northwest.\nIn the beginning, the Atmorans were overwhelming the Snow Elves, cutting through them with ease until the arrival of the Snow Prince, who singlehandedly crushed the Atmorans greatly. The &lt;a href=\"Spear%20of%20the%20Snow%20Prince\"&gt;Spear of the Snow Prince&lt;/a&gt; was legendary for the battle, as it killed various figures, such as &lt;a href=\"Freida%20Oaken-Wand\"&gt;Freida Oaken-Wand&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Heimdall%20the%20Frenzied\"&gt;Heimdall the Frenzied&lt;/a&gt;. Amidst the slaughter, the Snow Prince had killed the mother of a lowly twelve-year-old girl, &lt;a href=\"Finna%20%28Lore%29\"&gt;Finna&lt;/a&gt;, a squire to her mother. Enraged, Finna grabbed her mother's sword and pierced it into the Snow Prince's breast. This gave the Atmorans the leeway to ultimately defeat the Snow Elves in Solstheim. This was the end of the elven race's illustrious history, although small remnants took to isolation, never to be heard from again. Ysgramor and his chieftain gave the Snow Prince a proper burial, with the exception of &lt;a href=\"Stalhrim\"&gt;Stalhrim&lt;/a&gt;, which was reserved for Nords. His burial ground became &lt;a href=\"Jolgeirr%20Barrow\"&gt;Jolgeirr Barrow&lt;/a&gt;. From then on, the Nords had conquered Solstheim, and eventually, the &lt;a href=\"Dwemer\"&gt;Dwemer&lt;/a&gt; settled in lands far from Nordic cities, resulting in &lt;a href=\"Nchardak\"&gt;Nchardak&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Fahlbtharz\"&gt;Fahlbtharz&lt;/a&gt;.\nSolstheim's Creation Myth; The Guardian &amp; the Traitor.\nThe modern-day &lt;a href=\"Skaal\"&gt;Skaal&lt;/a&gt; of Solstheim are the descendants of the &lt;a href=\"Dragon%20Cult\"&gt;Dragon Cult&lt;/a&gt; that ruled over Solstheim, sometime after Ysgramor's reign, as the Dragon Cult was prominent. One such priest, &lt;a href=\"Miraak\"&gt;Miraak&lt;/a&gt;, who was the first known &lt;a href=\"Dragonborn%20%28Lore%29\"&gt;Dragonborn&lt;/a&gt;, long before the appearance of &lt;a href=\"St.%20Alessia\"&gt;St. Alessia&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Cyrodiil\"&gt;Cyrodiil&lt;/a&gt;. Miraak had come into contact with &lt;a href=\"Hermaeus%20Mora\"&gt;Hermaeus Mora&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"Daedric%20Prince\"&gt;Daedric Prince&lt;/a&gt; of Forbidden Knowledge. The Wretched Abyss had lured Miraak with great knowledge, and the ability to Bend the Will of &lt;a href=\"Dragons%20%28Lore%29\"&gt;Dragons&lt;/a&gt;, and so he plotted against his Dragon Overlords, killing them in numbers outside his grand temple. Miraak could absorb the Dragon Souls, giving them unbeknownst power that would eventually lead to their downfall. Three Dragon Priests, known as the &lt;a href=\"Acolyte%20Priests\"&gt;Acolyte Priests&lt;/a&gt;, would follow Miraak and disown the Dragon Cult.\nThe leaders of &lt;a href=\"Bromjunaar\"&gt;Bromjunaar&lt;/a&gt; had sent the Warrior-Priest, &lt;a href=\"Vahlok\"&gt;Vahlok&lt;/a&gt; to defeat Miraak. The battle between these two forces resulted in the mainland splitting, and that broken piece of land became modern-day Solstheim. In an epic battle between good and evil, the two priests had battled until Vahlok had emerged victorious. The Acolyte Priests were defeated, from &lt;a href=\"Ahzidal\"&gt;Ahzidal&lt;/a&gt; to &lt;a href=\"Zahkriisos\"&gt;Zahkriisos&lt;/a&gt;. While other tales would end it here, the truth is different. Before Vahlok would kill him, Miraak withdrew into &lt;a href=\"Apocrypha\"&gt;Apocrypha&lt;/a&gt;, while Vahlok the Guardian stays vigilant for his return. The tale of the Guardian and the Traitor became a cautionary tale to the Skaal Tribe, as a warning for the inevitable return. Vahlok became the ruler of Solstheim, and the Dragon Cult of Solstheim remained isolated from the rest, resulting in their transformation into the modern-day Skaal. Contrary to the Dragon Priest's rule in Skyrim, Vahlok was seen as a wise and just ruler, bringing an age of prosperity and peace to Solstheim and its people.\n&lt;a href=\"Second%20Era\"&gt;Second Era&lt;/a&gt;.\nRecords of Solstheim throughout the Years.\nSolstheim's history since the Dragon Cult is largely unknown, but it has appeared in history since the Merethic Era, and before even &lt;a href=\"Tiber%20Septim\"&gt;Tiber Septim&lt;/a&gt;'s rise to power. Despite the Skaal's isolation, they are acknowledged by the government of Skyrim, as &lt;a href=\"High%20King%20Logrolf\"&gt;High King Logrolf&lt;/a&gt;, who was alive during the reign of &lt;a href=\"Versidue%20Shaie\"&gt;Versidue Shaie&lt;/a&gt;, had a set of &lt;a href=\"Stalhrim\"&gt;Stalhrim&lt;/a&gt; Armor on display, courtesy of the Skaal. The island of Solstheim was considered a territory of Skyrim, ever since the Battle of the Moesring, and so it has been used by the province, but it did not have a known centralized settlement like the &lt;a href=\"East%20Empire%20Company\"&gt;East Empire Company&lt;/a&gt; had with &lt;a href=\"Fort%20Frostmoth\"&gt;Fort Frostmoth&lt;/a&gt;. Because of how unpopulated Solstheim is, many people took to the island for a private retreat, where one scholar lived in &lt;a href=\"White%20Ridge%20Barrow\"&gt;White Ridge Barrow&lt;/a&gt; to conduct experiments on explosive, elemental spiders. With the schism that had befallen onto Skyrim, it is unknown which kingdom claimed Solstheim but considering its location; it was likely claimed by the &lt;a href=\"Eastern%20Kingdom\"&gt;Eastern Kingdom&lt;/a&gt;. It was unharmed, nor utilized by the invading &lt;a href=\"Kamal\"&gt;Kamal&lt;/a&gt;i Army in the &lt;a href=\"Second%20Akaviri%20Invasion\"&gt;Second Akaviri Invasion&lt;/a&gt;, as they bypassed the island and headed straight for &lt;a href=\"Windhelm\"&gt;Windhelm&lt;/a&gt;. Second Era cartography has depicted Solstheim among other the other provinces, in the seas shared by Skyrim and Morrowind, but as the time went on, the island of Solstheim had become forgotten until in the late Third Era.\n&lt;a href=\"Third%20Era\"&gt;Third Era&lt;/a&gt;.\nHrothmund the Red &amp; Thirsk Mead Hall.\nThe Skaal are a spiritual-folk, one that has deviated from the Nordic culture that the race is known for. A group of Skaal decided to leave the Skaal and their strict religious culture, seeking the thrill of fighting by his own free will. Leading the helm was &lt;a href=\"Hrothmund%20the%20Red\"&gt;Hrothmund the Red&lt;/a&gt;, who took his group of warriors across the Felsaad Coast, until he spotted a plot of land along &lt;a href=\"Lake%20Fjalding\"&gt;Lake Fjalding&lt;/a&gt;. Within the span of several months, the &lt;a href=\"Thirsk%20Mead%20Hall\"&gt;Thirsk Mead Hall&lt;/a&gt; was constructed. However, the construction of Thirsk had caused the creature, the &lt;a href=\"Udyrfrykte\"&gt;Udyrfrykte&lt;/a&gt; had awoken from the &lt;a href=\"Caves%20of%20Fjalding\"&gt;Caves of Fjalding&lt;/a&gt;. Wreaking havoc on Thirsk. The Thirsk Nords dwindled half in numbers, but fortunately, the wizard named &lt;a href=\"Eldrid%20Ice-Light\"&gt;Eldrid Ice-Light&lt;/a&gt; sealed the creature back into the cave. Two months later, Thirsk was rebuilt. But with the Udyrfrykte dealt with, another problem arose when &lt;a href=\"Drengr%20Bronze-Helm\"&gt;Drengr Bronze-Helm&lt;/a&gt; had questioned Hrothmund's leadership, and sought to become Chieftain. In response, Hrothmund had cleaved Drengr's head off and placed it onto his mantle. It became the symbol of his leadership, and that he was indeed worthy of being the Chieftain of Thirsk. And so the ancient tradition was born. Any race or sex could attempt to claim the throne, as long as, they presented an honorable trophy and Hrothmund's spirit consents. Thirsk was peaceful for a time until Hrothmund yearned for battle, and so he took to the &lt;a href=\"Moesring%20Mountains\"&gt;Moesring Mountains&lt;/a&gt; to kill the White Wolf, &lt;a href=\"Ondjage\"&gt;Ondjage the Fell Wolf&lt;/a&gt;. But in the end, Hrothmund was defeated. The sight would become &lt;a href=\"Hrothmund%27s%20Barrow\"&gt;Hrothmund's Barrow&lt;/a&gt;, and it was here, the Thirsk Warriors slew the beast together, in honor of their Chieftain. Thirsk had thrived since.\nThe East Empire Company &amp; Raven Rock.\nBy the late Third Era, Solstheim was practically forgotten, despite its location (between &lt;a href=\"Windhelm\"&gt;Windhelm&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Blacklight\"&gt;Blacklight&lt;/a&gt;), it was untouched, until in &lt;a href=\"3E%20427\"&gt;3E 427&lt;/a&gt; when the &lt;a href=\"Imperials\"&gt;Imperials&lt;/a&gt; of the &lt;a href=\"East%20Empire%20Company\"&gt;East Empire Company&lt;/a&gt; had re-discovered Solstheim. The Company soon took to establishing their ground with the construction of &lt;a href=\"Fort%20Frostmoth\"&gt;Fort Frostmoth&lt;/a&gt;. The &lt;a href=\"Imperial%20Legion\"&gt;Imperial Legion&lt;/a&gt; was soon stationed in Frostmoth, with Captain &lt;a href=\"Falx%20Carius\"&gt;Falx Carius&lt;/a&gt; named the de-facto leader. In time, citizens of the Empire, coming from either Windhelm in Skyrim, or &lt;a href=\"Khuul\"&gt;Khuul&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Vvardenfell\"&gt;Vvardenfell&lt;/a&gt;. These colonies would go on to create the township of &lt;a href=\"Raven%20Rock\"&gt;Raven Rock&lt;/a&gt;, as a large vein of &lt;a href=\"Ebony\"&gt;Ebony&lt;/a&gt; was discovered on the bay. Within the span of several months, Raven Rock was created, as an Imperial charter town that produced Ebony to Windhelm. However, with the port-town established, a power struggle had occurred between &lt;a href=\"Falco%20Galenus\"&gt;Falco Galenus&lt;/a&gt;, an Imperial prospector of the EEC, and &lt;a href=\"Carnius%20Magius\"&gt;Carnius Magius&lt;/a&gt;, the corrupt benefactor of Raven Rock. While the former wanted Raven Rock to thrive for the better good, the latter ruled over the town like a dictator, silencing those he deed no longer useful. After discovering raw veins of &lt;a href=\"Stalhrim\"&gt;Stalhrim&lt;/a&gt; in the Raven Rock Mine, and an attack orchestrated by Carnius, Raven Rock was able to thrive, and a &lt;a href=\"Nerevarine\"&gt;new person&lt;/a&gt; was named the Factor of Raven Rock, governing the town in its early years.\nThe Bloodmoon Prophecy &amp; the Will of Hircine.\nThroughout the eras, the &lt;a href=\"Daedric%20Prince\"&gt;Daedric Prince&lt;/a&gt; of the Hunt &amp; the Great Game, &lt;a href=\"Hircine\"&gt;Hircine&lt;/a&gt; has called upon warriors throughout the continent, to partake in a game, such as the &lt;a href=\"Ritual%20of%20the%20Innocent%20Quarry\"&gt;Ritual of the Innocent Quarry&lt;/a&gt; (or the Wild Hunt), to hunt a figure such as an &lt;a href=\"Indrik\"&gt;Indrik&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"Herne%20Egahirn\"&gt;Herne Egahirn&lt;/a&gt; throughout the &lt;a href=\"March%20of%20Sacrifices\"&gt;March of Sacrifices&lt;/a&gt; or the remnants of &lt;a href=\"Caecilly%20Island\"&gt;Caecilly Island&lt;/a&gt;, or pit various warriors together, to the death, such as this example. Hircine is not exempt from attempting to enter &lt;a href=\"Tamriel\"&gt;Tamriel&lt;/a&gt;, as in &lt;a href=\"3E%20427\"&gt;3E 427&lt;/a&gt;, Hircine and his forces arrive on the plains of Solstheim, to initiate a Hunt, that is known to the Skaal, as the &lt;a href=\"Bloodmoon%20Prophecy\"&gt;Bloodmoon Prophecy&lt;/a&gt;. Hircine descends onto Tamriel once every era, to pit the greatest warriors of Solstheim against each other, releasing his hounds. 3E 427 is an auspicious time, as it was when Imperial colonies moved onto Solstheim, bringing new potential candidates. There are several signs of the prophecy. It begins when &lt;a href=\"Werewolves\"&gt;Werewolves&lt;/a&gt; appear throughout Solstheim, who would remain on the island as the &lt;a href=\"Frostmoon%20Pack\"&gt;Frostmoon Pack&lt;/a&gt;. Then, \"Fire from the Eye of Glass,\" where a pillar of fire sprouts from the middle of Lake Fjalding. The third sign is the \"Tide of Woe,\" when bodies of dead &lt;a href=\"Horker\"&gt;Horker&lt;/a&gt; wash onto shore throughout the northern coast. Finally, the eponymous Bloodmoon of &lt;a href=\"Secunda\"&gt;Secunda&lt;/a&gt; blots the sky. Hircine's Hunt took place within &lt;a href=\"Mortrag%20Glacier\"&gt;Mortrag Glacier&lt;/a&gt;. A &lt;a href=\"Nerevarine\"&gt;traveler&lt;/a&gt; had participated in the hunt, along with, Falx Carius, &lt;a href=\"Tharsten%20Heart-Fang\"&gt;Tharsten Heart-Fang&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Karstaag\"&gt;Karstaag&lt;/a&gt;. In the end, the mysterious traveler had emerged victorious from Hircine's Hunt, defeating Hircine's Guile of Aspect. While Tharsten &amp; Karstaag were unable to survive, Falx Carius returned to Fort Frostmoth.\n&lt;a href=\"Fourth%20Era\"&gt;Fourth Era&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe Red Year &amp; Morrowind's Expansion.\nBy the time the 3rd Pocket Guide was published in &lt;a href=\"3E%20432\"&gt;3E 432&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Raven%20Rock\"&gt;Raven Rock&lt;/a&gt; was a flourishing town, between Windhelm and Blacklight, with a population consisting of Imperials and Nords. And by the time the &lt;a href=\"Oblivion%20Crisis\"&gt;Oblivion Crisis&lt;/a&gt;, Raven Rock was unaffected by the forces of &lt;a href=\"Mehrunes%20Dagon\"&gt;Mehrunes Dagon&lt;/a&gt;, although, it was unknown whether Oblivion Gates opened in Solstheim, or whether it had affected Fort Frostmoth and the Skaal settlements. With the &lt;a href=\"Fall%20of%20Ald%27ruhn\"&gt;Fall of Ald'ruhn&lt;/a&gt; in the Crisis, &lt;a href=\"House%20Redoran\"&gt;House Redoran&lt;/a&gt; had sent groups led by Councilors to various territories, to re-established themselves. The city-state of &lt;a href=\"Ald%27ruhn\"&gt;Ald'ruhn&lt;/a&gt; was the seat of Redoran's council at the time, but with &lt;a href=\"Skar\"&gt;Skar&lt;/a&gt;'s destruction, many were forced to relocate. &lt;a href=\"Brara%20Morvayn\"&gt;Brara Morvayn&lt;/a&gt;, Lady of &lt;a href=\"Maar%20Gan\"&gt;Maar Gan&lt;/a&gt; and Councilor of Ald'ruhn traveled for Raven Rock, and with negotiations with the East Empire Company, the Dark Elves were properly initiated into Solstheim. Although, figures such as Falx Carius were opposed to this, seeing them as a threat. But when the &lt;a href=\"Red%20Year\"&gt;Red Year&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"4E%205\"&gt;4E 5&lt;/a&gt; had occurred, Solstheim had drastically changed forever. The ensuing ash storm that hit the south had obliterated the Hirstaang Forest, and Raven Rock's wall was severely damaged, barely saving the town. The main province of Morrowind was in a much worse condition, and so minor groups such as &lt;a href=\"House%20Sathil\"&gt;House Sathil&lt;/a&gt; of the &lt;a href=\"Indoril\"&gt;Indoril&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"House%20Ulen\"&gt;House Ulen&lt;/a&gt; of the &lt;a href=\"Hlaalu\"&gt;Hlaalu&lt;/a&gt; migrated onto Solstheim. The ash swallowed Fort Frostmoth and General Falx Carius. Raven Rock was defenseless, but with the EEC's permission, Brara Morvayn had brought Redoran Guards to protect the city. As more and more refugees arrived onto Solstheim, the then &lt;a href=\"High%20King\"&gt;High King&lt;/a&gt; of Skyrim had given the region of Solstheim to Morrowind in &lt;a href=\"4E%2016\"&gt;4E 16&lt;/a&gt;. The East Empire Company had relinquished all holdings of Solstheim to the Great House Redoran, to which it remained so ever since.\nElhul Sathil &amp; the Cursed Blade, Umbra.\nAmidst the rubble of Vivec City, now known as the &lt;a href=\"Scathing%20Bay\"&gt;Scathing Bay&lt;/a&gt;, was the accursed sword, &lt;a href=\"Umbra\"&gt;Umbra&lt;/a&gt;, to which the Sathil noblemen, &lt;a href=\"Elhul%20Sathil\"&gt;Elhul Sathil&lt;/a&gt; took for his own, and immediately going mad from the blade. Without the soul of Umbra, the sword had become unstable and so Elhul was affected because of this. His madness caused his family to chain him, and take away the Umbra Sword. As time went on, Elhul had recovered but came into possession of the Umbra Sword, leading to his father, &lt;a href=\"Hleryn%20Sathil\"&gt;Hleryn Sathil&lt;/a&gt;, to seal him in a dungeon underneath Castle Sathil, in the Solstheim village of &lt;a href=\"Sathil%20%28Village%29\"&gt;Sathil&lt;/a&gt;. The young Dark Elf remained in his cell for years, until the arrival of two travelers. The Crown Prince of the &lt;a href=\"Mede%20Dynasty\"&gt;Mede Dynasty&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Attrebus%20Mede\"&gt;Attrebus Mede&lt;/a&gt;, and his aged Dunmeri companions, &lt;a href=\"Ezhmaar%20Sul\"&gt;Ezhmaar Sul&lt;/a&gt; had arrived onto Solstheim, seeking the blade of Umbra. Elhul's sister, &lt;a href=\"Nirai%20Sathil\"&gt;Nirai Sathil&lt;/a&gt; had escorted them to her brother's prison, and trapped them there, hoping that they would kill Elhul and free him from his torment. In the end, Attrebus had unsheathed his trusted-sword, &lt;a href=\"Flashing\"&gt;Flashing&lt;/a&gt;, and killed Elhul. He wrapped Umbra, so that he would not be affected, and began to part. But Nirai, and &lt;a href=\"House%20Sathil\"&gt;House Sathil&lt;/a&gt; prevented them from leaving, imprisoning in Elhul's former cell so that Umbra would not go into circulation. This proved to be in vain as both Attrebus &amp; Sul teleported to &lt;a href=\"the%20Fields%20of%20Regret\"&gt;the Fields of Regret&lt;/a&gt;, the Daedric Plane of &lt;a href=\"Clavicus%20Vile\"&gt;Clavicus Vile&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe Colony of Raven Rock; the Dark Elves of Redoran.\nBrara Morvayn's influence over Raven Rock began with the introduction of House Redoran Guard, and in the aftermath of the Red Year, when Brara commissioned the construction of &lt;a href=\"the%20Bulwark\"&gt;the Bulwark&lt;/a&gt;, to protect Raven Rock from the common ash-storms. Almost a year later, the Bulwark was constructed, and it proved to be a valued asset. The EEC relinquished Raven Rock to House Redoran, and so Brara had complete control over Raven Rock. With the EEC gone, the Imperial population moved back to &lt;a href=\"Cyrodiil\"&gt;Cyrodiil&lt;/a&gt;, which would have been reigned over by &lt;a href=\"Thules%20the%20Gibbering\"&gt;Thules the Gibbering&lt;/a&gt;, a year before &lt;a href=\"Titus%20Mede%20I\"&gt;Titus Mede I&lt;/a&gt; took over the Imperial Province. What followed after was Raven Rock's golden years, when peace was prominent, and the Ebony Mine was bringing abundant sums of money. When Councilor Brara Morvayn passed away in &lt;a href=\"4E%2065\"&gt;4E 65&lt;/a&gt;, her son, &lt;a href=\"Lleril%20Morvayn\"&gt;Lleril Morvayn&lt;/a&gt; took over Raven Rock, and it was well-received by the people, as he was very reminiscent of his mother.\nThings went smoothly until in &lt;a href=\"4E%2095\"&gt;4E 95&lt;/a&gt;, when &lt;a href=\"Vilur%20Ulen\"&gt;Vilur Ulen&lt;/a&gt; made an assassination attempt on Councilor Lleril. He was saved by the Redoran Guard, under the command of &lt;a href=\"Modyn%20Veleth\"&gt;Modyn Veleth&lt;/a&gt;. It was revealed to be part of a revenge plot against House Redoran, for they had played a significant role in &lt;a href=\"House%20Hlaalu\"&gt;House Hlaalu&lt;/a&gt;'s demotion as a Great House. The purpose of the assassination was to send a message to the &lt;a href=\"Grand%20Council\"&gt;Grand Council&lt;/a&gt;, to demonstrate the Redoran's weakness. Further information showed that Vilur Ulen had attempted to organize a coup d'etat against the Councilor, but he and his conspirators were executed. His descendants remained in hiding on Raven Rock as members of &lt;a href=\"House%20Severin\"&gt;House Severin&lt;/a&gt;. As time went on, Raven Rock's prosperity dwindled as in &lt;a href=\"4E%20130\"&gt;4E 130&lt;/a&gt;, the Bulwark was showing its age, in &lt;a href=\"4E%20150\"&gt;4E 150&lt;/a&gt;, a group of &lt;a href=\"Argonians\"&gt;Argonians&lt;/a&gt; attempted to conquer Solstheim, until they were defeated by Councilor Morvayn personally, and in &lt;a href=\"4E%20170\"&gt;4E 170&lt;/a&gt;, the Raven Rock Ebony Mine had dried out. Councilor Morvayn's attempt to feed his people came out from his pocket, leaving him broke. As a result, some families left Solstheim for the mainland. Raven Rock had been in somewhat of a decline, but people remained regardless of their situation.\nThe Temple of Miraak &amp; the Corrupted Stones.\nDuring the &lt;a href=\"Skyrim%20Civil%20War\"&gt;Skyrim Civil War&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"4E%20201\"&gt;4E 201&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"Last%20Dragonborn\"&gt;Last Dragonborn&lt;/a&gt; had made their appearance known in the great plains of &lt;a href=\"Whiterun%20Hold\"&gt;Whiterun Hold&lt;/a&gt;, when they had slain the &lt;a href=\"Dragons%20%28Lore%29\"&gt;Dragon&lt;/a&gt; known as &lt;a href=\"Mirmulnir\"&gt;Mirmulnir&lt;/a&gt;. News of this battle had spread across the north, and even as far as Solstheim. At the same time, cultist of the long-dead Miraak had appeared, and the &lt;a href=\"All-Maker%20Stones\"&gt;All-Maker Stones&lt;/a&gt; became corrupted by his magic. People from as far as Raven Rock, to Thirsk, and in the deep Moesrings were affected. Miraak's cultist traveled for Skyrim to kill the Dragonborn, only to fail, bringing them to Solstheim. Miraak's cultist and his mind-controlled followers constructed the &lt;a href=\"Temple%20of%20Miraak\"&gt;Temple of Miraak&lt;/a&gt; around the &lt;a href=\"Tree%20Stone\"&gt;Tree Stone&lt;/a&gt;. Both the Dragonborn and a Skaal, &lt;a href=\"Frea\"&gt;Frea&lt;/a&gt; enter the temple, to discover one of the &lt;a href=\"Black%20Books\"&gt;Black Books&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"Hermaeus%20Mora\"&gt;Hermaeus Mora&lt;/a&gt;. The situation had become clear, Miraak was attempting to re-enter Tamriel, and conquer Solstheim. The Skaal utilized a ward to prevent Miraak's influence from getting to them. &lt;a href=\"Storn%20Crag-Strider\"&gt;Storn Crag-Strider&lt;/a&gt;, the village chieftain tasked the Last Dragonborn to travel for &lt;a href=\"Saering%27s%20Watch\"&gt;Saering's Watch&lt;/a&gt;, a Dragon Aerie in the Moesring Mountains, where they acquired the shout of &lt;a href=\"Bend%20Will\"&gt;Bend Will&lt;/a&gt;, a long-forgotten &lt;a href=\"Thu%27um\"&gt;Thu'um&lt;/a&gt; that was used by Miraak during his time as &lt;a href=\"Dragon%20Priest\"&gt;Dragon Priest&lt;/a&gt;. With this powerful shout, the Last Dragonborn traveled to all of the All-Makers Stones, freeing everyone from Miraak's power.\nMiraak's Downfall; At the Summit of Apocrypha.\nAs the Dragonborn cleansed the All-Maker Stones throughout Solstheim, they were investigating the Black Books of Hermaeus Mora, with help from the &lt;a href=\"House%20Telvanni\"&gt;House Telvanni&lt;/a&gt; Magister, &lt;a href=\"Neloth\"&gt;Neloth&lt;/a&gt;. Who remained on Solstheim sometime after the Red Year, creating &lt;a href=\"Tel%20Mithryn\"&gt;Tel Mithryn&lt;/a&gt; on the site of &lt;a href=\"Himmelhost%20Barrow\"&gt;Himmelhost Barrow&lt;/a&gt;. The two delved deep into the sunken ruins of &lt;a href=\"Nchardak\"&gt;Nchardak&lt;/a&gt;, where they reactivated the city's steam system and recovered the Black Book stowed away. The Book in Nchardak was , where the Dragonborn learned off the second word of Bend Will. With everything set in motion, the warrior only needed the final word, which only Hermaeus Mora had himself. In exchange for the final word, Storn Crag-Strider offered his life and the secret knowledge of the Skaal to the Daedric Prince, for the word. In the end, Storn was killed, and the Dragonborn earned the final word. The Dragonborn entered Apocrypha once again, where he would control the Dragon, &lt;a href=\"Sahrotaar\"&gt;Sahrotaar&lt;/a&gt; and defeated Miraak thrice over. Ultimately, Miraak's fate was sealed by Herma-Mora, and the Last Dragonborn was named his new Champion. Miraak's influence over Solstheim was broken and peace was restored, for a time.\nThe Revival of Raven Rock; the Second Golden Age.\nDespite Miraak's downfall, the situation in Raven Rock did not change. Beyond a &lt;a href=\"Declaration%20of%20War\"&gt;Declaration of War&lt;/a&gt; from the revived &lt;a href=\"Falx%20Carius\"&gt;Falx Carius&lt;/a&gt;, bustle in the mining town was low, and business was practically non-existent. In the very early Fourth Era, the Imperial archaeologist, and one of the original builders of Raven Rock, &lt;a href=\"Gratian%20Caerellius\"&gt;Gratian Caerellius&lt;/a&gt; had returned to the town to investigate a Nordic ruin uncovered in the ebony mine. However, he had disappeared without a trace, and his family remained on Solstheim. The East Empire Company covered up the story by declaring that he was killed in the mine from a cave-in. Eventually, the mine was closed by the Councilor. Gratian's descendent, &lt;a href=\"Crescius%20Caerellius\"&gt;Crescius Caerellius&lt;/a&gt; became the Foreman, despite its closure, and had a gut feeling that ebony was still in the mine. A &lt;a href=\"Last%20Dragonborn\"&gt;mysterious traveler&lt;/a&gt; had encountered an old Crescius and was asked by him to investigate the ebony mine. It was revealed to be a closed-off section of the &lt;a href=\"Bloodskal%20Barrow\"&gt;Bloodskal Barrow&lt;/a&gt;, the burial tomb of the Acolyte Priest, &lt;a href=\"Zahkriisos\"&gt;Zahkriisos&lt;/a&gt;. With the mine cleared and the story illuminated, the ebony mine had re-opened, and business was booming. The steady flow of ebony ore from Raven Rock had increased. While it proved to be fortunate for Raven Rock, some saw it as an opportunity for another attempt of change.\nAnother plot from House Ulen was conducted on Lleril Morvayn, just as things were changing for the better. Modyn Veleth of the Town Guard had hired the mysterious traveler to investigate this suspicion that the Councilor had, by sleuthing through the &lt;a href=\"Ulen%20Ancestral%20Tomb\"&gt;Ulen Ancestral Tomb&lt;/a&gt; at the Temple. They learned of House Severin's involvement in Ulen matters, and so a private investigation of the Severin Manor was made. Through hidden documents, it was revealed that the Dark Elves of the Severin Family were a cover for the Ulen, each one of them were members of &lt;a href=\"House%20Hlaalu\"&gt;House Hlaalu&lt;/a&gt;, relatives of Vilur Ulen, the one that attempted to take Morvayn's life several years prior. The patriarch and son of Vilur, &lt;a href=\"Vendil%20Ulen\"&gt;Vendil Ulen&lt;/a&gt; had contacted the &lt;a href=\"Morag%20Tong\"&gt;Morag Tong&lt;/a&gt; in his plot against the Redoran noble. They took refuge in &lt;a href=\"Ashfallow%20Citadel\"&gt;Ashfallow Citadel&lt;/a&gt;, in which the mysterious traveler had dealt with them swiftly. The Ulen Family had ultimately failed in their mission, and the Colony of Raven Rock continued to thrive throughout the Fourth Era."}

Green plains and small hills are scattered throughout the central region, known as the &lt;a href=\"Isinfier%20Plains\"&gt;Isinfier Plains&lt;/a&gt;. The northwestern region is made of the &lt;a href=\"Moesring%20Mountains\"&gt;Moesring Mountains&lt;/a&gt;, the tallest peak of the island, it is covered in snow and inhospitable. A large &lt;a href=\"Mortrag%20Glacier\"&gt;glacier&lt;/a&gt; covers the northwestern shore of the island. The northeastern region is known as &lt;a href=\"Felsaad%20Coast\"&gt;Felsaad Coast&lt;/a&gt;, there the &lt;a href=\"Skaal\"&gt;native&lt;/a&gt;'s &lt;a href=\"Skaal%20Village%20%28Bloodmoon%29\"&gt;village&lt;/a&gt; can be found, bordered in the south by the &lt;a href=\"Lake%20Fjalding%20%28Bloodmoon%29\"&gt;Lake Fjalding&lt;/a&gt;.\nThere are three rivers that flow through Solstheim, the\u00a0&lt;a href=\"Iggnir%20River\"&gt;Iggnir River&lt;/a&gt;, the\u00a0&lt;a href=\"Harstrad%20River\"&gt;Harstrad River&lt;/a&gt;, and the\u00a0&lt;a href=\"Isild%20River\"&gt;Isild River&lt;/a&gt;.\nSimilarly to\u00a0&lt;a href=\"Bruma%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;Bruma&lt;/a&gt;\u00a0in\u00a0&lt;a href=\"Cyrodiil\"&gt;Cyrodiil&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Whiterun%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Whiterun&lt;/a&gt; in Skyrim, Solstheim's\u00a0native Nords, known as the &lt;a href=\"Skaal\"&gt;Skaal&lt;/a&gt;,\u00a0have the same type of architecture, houses and huts are made of timber, decorated with ornate carvings.

He will tell you that someone has fed their tame mammoths &lt;a href=\"Rotmeth\"&gt;Rotmeth&lt;/a&gt;, causing them to escape their pens and rampage through the city. They are currently asleep in a drunken stupour; Galithor will ask you to wake them and beat them up a bit so that they will return to their pens. \nYou will find the mammoths throughout the area. Throw the water Galithor gave you at them to wake them, then rough them up a bit as they attack you. Once you have defeated four mammoths, head back to Galithor. The moment you get back, someone named Alphrost will appear and tell Galithor that someone has broken into the brewery. Speak with him and he will tell you that someone knocked him out while he was at the brewery; said person is probably still in the top floor. Alphrost will send you to go check on the Rotmeth supply there. \nThe brewery is on the top floor of the &lt;a href=\"Tall%20Trunk%20Tavern\"&gt;Tall Trunk Tavern&lt;/a&gt;.

There, take the ladder to the brewery; you will find a woman named &lt;a href=\"Firuin%20%28Malabal%20Tor%29\"&gt;Firuin&lt;/a&gt; as well as a bunch of &lt;a href=\"Scamp%20%28Online%29\"&gt;scamps&lt;/a&gt;. Kill them, then read the Note from Firuin on the desk. It appears that Firuin used to be with Galithor, but has left him because he did not appreciate her talents. She is now stealing the rotmeth out of vengeance towards him. \nTake this infomation to Galithor, who will be just outside the brewery. He will mention that Firuin likely took the rotmeth to a place called Balding Hill, northeast of town. This location will not be marked on your map, but it is northwest of the &lt;a href=\"Chancel%20of%20Divine%20Entreaty\"&gt;Chancel of Divine Entreaty&lt;/a&gt;.

Head further east onto the docks and you will find &lt;a href=\"Raevild%20Snowraven\"&gt;Raevild Snowraven&lt;/a&gt;, who will teach you the third lyric. Finally, the second lyric can be found in the library on the northwestern side of the island, by speaking to &lt;a href=\"Knudikur\"&gt;Knudikur&lt;/a&gt;. Alternatively, the lyrics and tune can be gathered in any other order.\nAfter you have collected all the parts of the song, head to the Skald Manor in the north of the island and speak with Sage Odana. She will ask you to convince the only other waking person on the island, a drunk named &lt;a href=\"Maraamur\"&gt;Maraamur&lt;/a&gt;, to help you. He will be upstairs. While heading over to him, make sure to pick up the copy of &lt;a href=\"The%20Wandering%20Skald\"&gt;The Wandering Skald&lt;/a&gt; lying on the table. Speak with Maraamur and he will agree to help you if you teach him the tune. Teach it to him by playing the lutes on the wall. You will want to start with the regular strung lute, then the low strung one and finally the high strung one. After teaching Maraamur the tune, speak with him again to teach him the lyrics. Now that he knows the song, he will tell you that he will need Engling's lute to break the spell. \nHead back to where you first met Sage Odana. The lute should be there, on the platform by Engling's sleeping body. After you have it, head to the southwest of the island and deliver the lute to Maraamur. Along the way, Vearmina herself will issue a threat to you. Once you have given him the lute, Maraamur will start performing the song. Vaermina will send some of her nightmares to interrupt him, so you will have to defend him. After he is done, a newly awakened Engling will tell you that it worked, then head off to the stage where you found her lute. Speak with her there to finish the quest."}

Note the simple rhyming scheme of AA/BB/CC, the sing-song but purposefully clumsy meter, and the jokes at the obviously absurd names, Umphatic Faer and Lanthippus Minthurk. The final joke that the stupid alchemist invents a potion to make himself smarter by pure accident would have appealed to the anti-intellectualism of audiences in the &lt;a href=\"Interregnum\"&gt;Interregnum&lt;/a&gt; period, but would certainly be rejected by the Dwemer. Note that even \"&lt;a href=\"Marobar%20Sul\"&gt;Marobar Sul&lt;/a&gt;\" refused to name any Dwemer Gods. The Dwemer religion, if it can even be called that, is one of the most complex and difficult puzzles of their culture. Over the millennia, the song became a popular tavern song in &lt;a href=\"High%20Rock\"&gt;High Rock&lt;/a&gt; before eventually disappearing from everything but scholarly books. Much like the Dwemer themselves."}

Despite the grim final image, the song is generally regarded as light and rollicking and a favorite in inns across &lt;a href=\"Skyrim\"&gt;Skyrim&lt;/a&gt;.\nRagnar The Red\n&lt;poem&gt;There once was a hero named Ragnar the Red,\nWho came riding to Whiterun from ole &lt;a href=\"Rorikstead\"&gt;Rorikstead&lt;/a&gt;!\nAnd the braggart did swagger and brandish his &lt;a href=\"Swords%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;blade&lt;/a&gt;,\nAs he told of bold battles and gold he had made!\nBut then he went quiet, did Ragnar the Red,\nWhen he met the shieldmaiden Matilda who said...\n\"Oh, you talk and you lie and you drink all our &lt;a href=\"mead\"&gt;mead&lt;/a&gt;!\nNow I think it's high time that you lie down and bleed!\"\nAnd so then came the clashing and slashing of steel,\nAs the brave lass Matilda charged in full of zeal!\nAnd the braggart named Ragnar was boastful no moooooree...\nWhen his ugly red head rolled around on the floor!&lt;/poem&gt;\n&lt;a href=\"The%20Dragonborn%20Comes\"&gt;The Dragonborn Comes&lt;/a&gt; has been handed down from generation to generation of bards. The Dragonborn in &lt;a href=\"Nords%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Nord&lt;/a&gt; culture is the archetype of what a Nord should be. The song itself has been used to rally soldiers and to bring hope.\nThe Dragonborn Comes\n&lt;poem&gt;Our hero, our hero, claims a warrior's heart.\nI tell you, I tell you, the &lt;a href=\"Last%20Dragonborn\"&gt;Dragonborn&lt;/a&gt; comes.\nWith a &lt;a href=\"Dragon%20Shouts\"&gt;Voice wielding power&lt;/a&gt; of the ancient Nord art.\nBelieve, believe, the Dragonborn comes.\nIt's an end to the evil, of all Skyrim's foes.\nBeware, beware, the Dragonborn comes.\nFor the darkness has passed, and the legend yet grows.\nYou'll know, you'll know the Dragonborn's come.&lt;/poem&gt;\n&lt;a href=\"The%20Age%20of%20Oppression\"&gt;The Age of Oppression&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"The%20Age%20of%20Aggression\"&gt;The Age of Aggression&lt;/a&gt; are variants of one song. It isn't known which of the two was written first but the tune, with loyalty appropriate lyrics, is quite popular on both sides of the war.\nThe Age of Oppression\n&lt;poem&gt;We drink to our youth, and to days come and gone.\nFor the age of oppression is now nearly done.\nWe'll drive out the Empire from this land that we own.\nWith our blood and our steel we will take back our home.\nAll hail to &lt;a href=\"Ulfric%20Stormcloak%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Ulfric&lt;/a&gt;!

Without a tune or a sure pronunciation the song is lost to time. It's included here to show the deep history of song here in Skyrim.

The revision is written by the same author. In the revision, the above song that could not be fully translated has been titled. The &lt;a href=\"Tale%20of%20the%20Tongues\"&gt;Tale of the Tongues&lt;/a&gt; has also been included.\nTale of the tongues is a newer song. One that has come in to favor since the Dragonborn put down Alduin. It actually describes the events of the first battle against the dragons.\n&lt;a href=\"Alduin%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Alduin&lt;/a&gt;'s wings, they did darken the sky. His roar fury's fire, and his scales sharpened scythes.\nMen ran and they cowered, and they fought and they died. They burned and they bled as they issued their cries.\nWe need saviors to free us from Alduin's rage. Heroes on the field of this new war to wage.\nAnd if Alduin wins, man is gone from this world. Lost in the shadow of the black wings unfurled.\nBut then came the &lt;a href=\"Tongues\"&gt;Tongues&lt;/a&gt; on that terrible day. Steadfast as winter, they entered the fray.\nAnd all heard the music of Alduin's doom. The sweet song of Skyrim, sky-shattering Thu'um.\nAnd so the Tongues freed us from Alduin's rage. Gave the gift of the Voice, ushered in a new Age.\nIf Alduin is eternal, then eternity's done. For his story is over and the dragons are gone."}

To defeat Fildgor, I must follow him there.\"\nWalkthrough.\nUpon finishing &lt;a href=\"Snow%20and%20Flame\"&gt;Snow and Flame&lt;/a&gt;, Queen &lt;a href=\"Nurnhilde\"&gt;Nurnhilde&lt;/a&gt; will tell the Vestige that &lt;a href=\"Fildgor%20Orcthane\"&gt;Fildgor Orcthane&lt;/a&gt; has entered &lt;a href=\"Sovngarde%20%28Location%29\"&gt;Sovngarde&lt;/a&gt; and is siphoning her soul. She will ask you to go after him by proceeding on through Skuldafn and reaching the peak, where you must step into the column of light. The Watcher at the Bridge guards the entrance to Sovngarde, but Nurnhilde says she will tell him to let you through. \nProceed through Skuldafn to the Peak. Along the way, you will face hordes of Fildgor's troops. Make sure to pick up the copy of \"&lt;a href=\"On%20Stepping%20Lightly\"&gt;On Stepping Lightly&lt;/a&gt;\" that is hidden in one of their tents, to the right of the staircase that will lead to the column of light. Once you've collected it, head up the stairs and into the column of light to reach Sovngarde.\nIn Sovngarde, you will find yourself in a giant room, with Fildgor on the other side. He will attack on sight and he has an attack that will temporarily stun you, so take care; he is not an easy opponent. After roughing him up a bit, speak to him and he will surrender. You have the choice to kill him here and now, or hand him over to king Jorunn. \nAfter you make your choice, the ghost of Nurnhilde will appear again. If you chose to spare Fildgor, she will tell you that you should have just killed him. Either way, she says that she hopes she will see her brother Jorunn in Sovngarde in due time. \nHead back to Tamriel. Jorunn will be standing outside the portal. Speak with him, and he will tell you that the fires worked, and that he will now execute Fildgor for treason. You can persuade him not to kill his brother, or you can let him carry on with it. \nDepending on your choice, Jorunn will now execute his brother. Either way, the pact leaders will now hold their moot at Skuldafn, where they pledge their continued allegiance to the Pact, and recognise Jorunn Skald-King as the leader of all three nations. Jorunn will then tell you to go tell his son about what transpired here. \nHead back to &lt;a href=\"Jorunn%27s%20Stand\"&gt;Jorunn's Stand&lt;/a&gt; and talk to &lt;a href=\"Prince%20Irnskar\"&gt;Prince Irnskar&lt;/a&gt;. he names you the King's Arrow and congratulates you on the victory."}

It is located in various places of .\nSeries.\nThis book is part of the \"&lt;a href=\"Songs%20of%20the%20Return\"&gt;Songs of the Return&lt;/a&gt;\" series:\nContents.\nWhen that final battle at the barren pass was completed, the melting snow carried elf-blood back to the sea, the crew of the &lt;a href=\"Kaal%20Kaaz\"&gt;Kaal Kaaz&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"Sadon%20Reyth\"&gt;Sadon Reyth&lt;/a&gt;, and the most exalted crew of our lord's ship, the &lt;a href=\"Ylgermet\"&gt;Ylgermet&lt;/a&gt;, at last parted ways, never to join shields again. They drew apart in that form which is not a loss, but a gain in knowing one's heart can be carried in the chests of others. So great the love that those first of the &lt;a href=\"Five%20Hundred%20Companions\"&gt;Five Hundred&lt;/a&gt; had for each other, and most especially for the great &lt;a href=\"Ysgramor\"&gt;Ysgramor&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Harbinger%20%28Rank%29\"&gt;harbinger&lt;/a&gt; of us all.\nThey pressed eastwards, seeking the sea, when they came upon the &lt;a href=\"Yngol%20Barrow\"&gt;barrow&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"Yngol\"&gt;Yngol&lt;/a&gt;, the mighty Ysgramor's son who had fallen to the whims of &lt;a href=\"Kyne\"&gt;Kyne&lt;/a&gt; rather than the treachery of the &lt;a href=\"Mer\"&gt;elves&lt;/a&gt;. Our lord had not expected to lay eyes upon it again so soon, and his grief flowed anew at the sight of it, as a reopened wound will bleed as it did when first received.\nHis eyes turned to the south, where &lt;a href=\"White%20River\"&gt;a river&lt;/a&gt; met &lt;a href=\"Sea%20of%20Ghosts\"&gt;the sea&lt;/a&gt;, and decreed that there would he and the crew of Ylgermet create a great city, in monument to the glories of &lt;a href=\"Men\"&gt;mankind&lt;/a&gt;, that from his &lt;a href=\"Palace%20of%20the%20Kings\"&gt;palace&lt;/a&gt; he might always look upon the hill of his dear son's resting place and feel that his line would know peace in this new home that was never known in &lt;a href=\"Atmora\"&gt;Atmora&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe elven captives were set to work, bringing forth stone to build in their conqueror's fashion. As many elves died in the building of the city as had the crew of the Ylgermet slain while on way to its site, and Ysgramor drove the wretches ever more, to build higher, to lay a claim to the river so that non might pass into the interior of this land without first showing due respect to its rightful claimant.\nThus was the great bridge constructed, Forever striding the river that no elf might sneak through to avenge his devious cousins. As the bridge was built long, so too was the palace built high, spires reaching the sky to show dominion even over the very winds that had brought forth such grief.\nIn the deep hallows beneath the city, a great tomb was prepared for the day when lord Ysgramor, harbinger to us all, would be called home to glory in &lt;a href=\"Sovngarde%20%28Location%29\"&gt;Sovngarde&lt;/a&gt;. But as we know, he chose instead to be buried on the &lt;a href=\"Ysgramor%27s%20Tomb\"&gt;shore&lt;/a&gt;, facing towards Atmora, that though his heart lived and died in this new land, it would forever yearn for the beauties of still-green Atmora, before the freezing took it.\nThus was founding of &lt;a href=\"Windhelm%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Windhelm&lt;/a&gt;, the city of kings though her history is long and her glories did not end with her founder."}

Yngol, the Elder, was the brave strategist, bringing his learnings to bear on the battlefield that his enemies would be defeated before they even know the battle had begun. Ylgar, the younger, was possessed of an unwavering spirit that drove his singular prowess to overwhelming feats in war. Together, the mind and the arm, they were capable of sowing a destruction most thorough and glorious to any for who stood before them.\nBefore they parted ways to gather their crews, the two clasped arms and necks in the old fashion and laughed at the heavens for their stories to come.\nYoung Ylgar than took the massive shipyards of &lt;a href=\"Jylkurfyk\"&gt;Jylkurfyk&lt;/a&gt; at the southern point and commissioned two ships for himself and his brother. He would command the &lt;a href=\"Darumzu\"&gt;Darumzu&lt;/a&gt;, and his brother the &lt;a href=\"Harakk\"&gt;Harakk&lt;/a&gt;, thus carrying the names of the two favored stars of their heavens. The shipmakers spirits had been suitable filled by Ysgramor's tales of the savage &lt;a href=\"Mer\"&gt;elves&lt;/a&gt;, and they set about to birth ships that befit their noble homeland.\nArrangements having been made, Ylgar set forth to the academies of honored soldiers, seeking out his most trusted friends and advisors to join him on the venture of the &lt;a href=\"Return\"&gt;Return&lt;/a&gt;. By now the stories of the new land to the south were spreading before him, and the mere emergence of his presence was enough to cause the finest warriors to lay down their present undertakings and follow him.\nSo was he able to call to his side the great &lt;a href=\"Shield-Siblings\"&gt;Shield-sisters&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Froa\"&gt;Froa&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Grosta%20%28Lore%29\"&gt;Grosta&lt;/a&gt; (who thought and spoke as one), and they brought with them the wise war-teacher &lt;a href=\"Adrimk\"&gt;Adrimk&lt;/a&gt;, who first taught them to dance among the blades. She in turn mustered all the students at her command, whose names were not yet made, but some of whom would one day be known:\n&lt;a href=\"Hermeskr\"&gt;Hermeskr&lt;/a&gt; (Who Threw His Shield), &lt;a href=\"Urlach\"&gt;Urlach&lt;/a&gt; (Who Breathed Fire), &lt;a href=\"Ramth%20the%20Greater\"&gt;Ramth the Greater&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Merkyllian%20Ramth\"&gt;Merkyllian Ramth&lt;/a&gt;, and the &lt;a href=\"Far-Sighted%20Uche\"&gt;Far-Sighted Uche&lt;/a&gt;, who would see the first of many dawns.\nOn the &lt;a href=\"Day%20of%20Final%20Passage\"&gt;Day of Final Passage&lt;/a&gt;, when the many-oared fleet would last see the distant green summers of Atmora, the brothers were near in their father's wake as the freshly joined &lt;a href=\"Five%20Hundred%20Companions\"&gt;Five Hundred&lt;/a&gt; would eagerly press onwards toward &lt;a href=\"Tamriel\"&gt;Tamriel&lt;/a&gt;. Ylgar would see his well-minded brother smiling from afar across the waves, and they shouted war-cries to each other, longer for the soon-day when their assembled crews would draw the treacherous elf blood into the ground which they would now claim for their own rights.\nBut &lt;a href=\"Kyne\"&gt;Kyne's&lt;/a&gt; ministrations are not to be taken lightly, and though her blessings gave wind to drive those brave sailors to their destiny, so too did her mighty tears fall to drive them apart. When the &lt;a href=\"Storm%20of%20Separation\"&gt;Storm of Separation&lt;/a&gt; first arose, young Ylgar had no fear, for his crew was strong and able, and their ship drove true through the forest of swells as though pulled by the rope of fate.\nWhen the skies cleared and Ylgar glimpsed again, with new eyes, the land of his past and future home, he knew his brother's vessel was not with his horizon. The Darumzu, arriving late, drew forth onto the sands and Ylgar rushed to his father to seek word of his brother. The great Ysgramor, harbinger of us all, wept for his lost son, and sought comfort in the arms of his only remaining joy. The crew of the Harakk became the first deaths among the Five Hundred and Ylgar, so enraged with love for his brother that his crew would soon be counted as the first among the many noble and honored names in &lt;a href=\"The%20Companions\"&gt;The Companions&lt;/a&gt;."}

Some turned with quick eyes back to their ships, for their hearts were bounded to the waves as sure as they were bounded to each other as allied &lt;a href=\"Five%20Hundred%20Companions\"&gt;Companions&lt;/a&gt;.\nOne such crew was that of the &lt;a href=\"Krilot%20Lok\"&gt;Krilot Lok&lt;/a&gt;, sinewy long folk from the eastern edge of &lt;a href=\"Atmora\"&gt;Atmora&lt;/a&gt;. Their ruddy skin matched the dawn and it was often said that morning herself learned [her glorious colors from] the first faces to meet her at the break of day. The great &lt;a href=\"Kyne\"&gt;Kyne&lt;/a&gt; lifted their souls and their winds, propelling them westwards with the new lands of &lt;a href=\"Tamriel\"&gt;Tamriel&lt;/a&gt; ever beckoning to the south.\nIn time, these perpetual wanderers came upon sights fearsome and terrible. Entire kingdoms of &lt;a href=\"Redguard\"&gt;men beyond their recognition&lt;/a&gt;, skin charred like overcooked meat. &lt;a href=\"Mer\"&gt;Elves&lt;/a&gt; even more devious than the northern betrayers disgraced their horizons, until they learned the sheltered ways between. &lt;a href=\"Elsweyr\"&gt;Great deserts&lt;/a&gt; the likes of which were never known in the homeland, peopled by &lt;a href=\"Khajiit\"&gt;beasts that spoke like men&lt;/a&gt;, with the savagery of elves. Many a notable and well-sung Companion met his end at the spears of the &lt;a href=\"Argonian\"&gt;legged snakes&lt;/a&gt; of the &lt;a href=\"Black%20Marsh\"&gt;southern marsh&lt;/a&gt;.\nAmong the brave crew of the Krilot Lok were of &lt;a href=\"Roeth\"&gt;Roeth&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Breff%20the%20Elder\"&gt;Breff the Elder&lt;/a&gt;, the great &lt;a href=\"Shield-Siblings\"&gt;Shield-brothers&lt;/a&gt; who often swapped spears, and their war-wives, &lt;a href=\"Britte%20%28Lore%29\"&gt;Britte&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Greyf\"&gt;Greyf&lt;/a&gt;, the fair child, &lt;a href=\"Shield-Siblings\"&gt;Shield-sisters&lt;/a&gt; in their own right who could bring the face of terror across the ice-chilled seas. Together these four stared into the abyss of trees that formed the foul-smelling homeland of the snake-men. And as they were blessed &lt;a href=\"Nede\"&gt;Atmorans&lt;/a&gt; who feared no shore of Tamriel, they ventured forth to seek out their glories in the most dangerous of these new lands.\nOnward they flew, ravaging the swamplands, beating a trail between themselves and their ship such that they would never lose sight of the shore. In the far-off day when at last Roeth would fall, when Britte screamed her famed war-cry so that all the marshes were emptied, this trail would fill once more with the treacherous snake men. So began the burning march of these great &lt;a href=\"captain\"&gt;captain&lt;/a&gt;s of us all."}

Many a brave Companion had already fallen to the &lt;a href=\"Giant%20%28Online%29\"&gt;giants&lt;/a&gt;. Stalwart &lt;a href=\"Valdur\"&gt;Valdur&lt;/a&gt; and Sly &lt;a href=\"Hakra\"&gt;Hakra&lt;/a&gt;, long may their spirits be honored, fell assaulting the wily half-giant.

His massive, iron-bound club swung forward to crush. Our Lord Ysgramor stepped aside and the club shattered the stone a pace from his side. Wuuthrad sang a blood song as it chopped into the club, breaking it asunder as if made from straw.\nSinmur howled his rage and hurled the stub of his once-fearsome weapon at Our Lord Ysgramor's head. He grappled Ysgramor, seeking to squeeze life away. A roar of laughter was the answer the monster received. Ysgramor's forehead and knee delivered two mighty blows. Sinmur screeched and fell to his knees before our lord.\nA song of death and delight keened from Wuuthrad as Ysgramor buried it deep in the giant-kin's skull. A splatter of gore and a death rattle came from Sinmur as Ysgramor gave a victory yell. The Companions cheered mightily as Wuuthrad waved overhead. The depredations of the giant and his vile kin were at last ended. And the legend of Ysgramor, Harbinger of us all, grew mightily that day."}

They yearned to bring the fear of &lt;a href=\"Men\"&gt;Men&lt;/a&gt; to new lands of the &lt;a href=\"Mer\"&gt;Mer&lt;/a&gt; that had not yet been put to the sword. They took to heart their Lord &lt;a href=\"Ysgramor%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Ysgramor&lt;/a&gt;'s words to \"Give no quarter. Show no kindness.\"\nA pyre upon the shore was raised for the Fallowfire. The ashes of their beloved vessel fell upon the waters and drifted toward &lt;a href=\"Atmora\"&gt;Atmora&lt;/a&gt;, cutting all ties with their homeland. Led by Captain &lt;a href=\"Gurilda%20Sharktooth\"&gt;Gurilda Sharktooth&lt;/a&gt;, the crew of the Fallowfire turned their backs to the sea and strode inland.\nSouth they traveled, seeking lands untrammeled by others of Ysgramor's crews. South and south they went, sowing the blood vengeance demanded by Ysgramor. No Mer escaped their axes once seen, no settlement remained unburnt in their path. Truly the Fallowfires brought their lord's wrath to bear upon the treacherous &lt;a href=\"Snow%20Elf\"&gt;Elves&lt;/a&gt;. As they journeyed, so the terror of them grew among the Mer.\nGurilda led her crew to the foothills of a lofty range of mountains. These they named &lt;a href=\"Ysgramor%27s%20Teeth\"&gt;Ysgramor's Teeth&lt;/a&gt; and long they sought a pass through them. When finally a way was found, the crew crossed over and into a new land. \"&lt;a href=\"The%20Rift%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;The Rift&lt;/a&gt;\" they called this region, for it was riven by deep canyons and swift-flowing rivers. In the name of Fallowfire, their lost Companions, and &lt;a href=\"Yngol\"&gt;Yngol&lt;/a&gt;, they scoured the land, burning Mer villages and putting all they encountered to the axe.\nFinally, the Mer offered battle. The cowardly Elves gathered in great numbers high atop a rocky hill, daring Gurilda's Companions to attack. And so they did. Challenges were offered, brave deeds were done, and heroes made. Battle raged through the day and as the sun touched the peaks of the western mountains, the Mer broke and fled. Gurilda lay dying, pierced by a multitude of weapons, but lived until sunset. Her spirit ascended to &lt;a href=\"Sovngarde%20%28Location%29\"&gt;Sovngarde&lt;/a&gt; knowing her crew was victorious.\nThat day, the dominion of Elves over the Rift was ended. The Companions claimed the land in the name of Ysgramor, Harbinger of us all, and made it free to all &lt;a href=\"Nords%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Nords&lt;/a&gt;. To honor their dead, the Companions labored long, delving into the hillside to craft a tomb. Gurilda was buried there, with all her weapons and armor. There too were placed the remains of &lt;a href=\"Bergitte%20the%20Toothless\"&gt;Bergitte the Toothless&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Kajord%20Eagle-Eye\"&gt;Kajord Eagle-Eye&lt;/a&gt;, laid alongside Gurilda as they had fallen in battle, defending their captain. Others of the honored dead were entombed as well. A mighty cairn of stone was erected around the tomb entrance, to forever mark the grave.\n&lt;a href=\"Vikord%20One-Ear\"&gt;Vikord One-Ear&lt;/a&gt;, long Gurilda's first mate but now captain, gazed long upon the hills rising about them and the valleys at their feet. This was a land he could love, where his people could prosper and grow. He decreed the crew's wandering at an end and caused a great hall to be built on the battle site. Thus was &lt;a href=\"Fallowstone%20Hall\"&gt;Fallowstone Hall&lt;/a&gt; created, in homage to the ship that carried them to these shores. From this time, the days of the Companions of the Rift are counted. Never may their glory fade!"}

The crews of the &lt;a href=\"Jorrvaskr\"&gt;Jorrvaskr&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"Fallowfire\"&gt;Fallowfire&lt;/a&gt;, and the &lt;a href=\"Kaal%20Kaaz\"&gt;Kaal Kaaz&lt;/a&gt; bade him eat, and boast, and drink. For the boon members of the &lt;a href=\"Five%20Hundred%20Companions\"&gt;Five Hundred Companions&lt;/a&gt; were abroad in the land. Stories were told, hearts won and lost, and always the smell of roasting meat hung in the air. The greatest of us all beckoned every warrior to his side, and spoke the tale of &lt;a href=\"Wuuthrad%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Wuuthrad's&lt;/a&gt; forging.\nEvery &lt;a href=\"Snow%20Elf\"&gt;Mer&lt;/a&gt; the Harbinger slew died at Wuuthrad's bite. All through the long campaign, the only weapon that would fit in the Harbinger's hand was the mighty Wuuthrad. As he told it, the most legendary of axes was forged in the darkest of nights.\nIt was the &lt;a href=\"Night%20of%20Tears\"&gt;Night of Tears&lt;/a&gt;. Ysgramor sat staring out across the waters. He rode upon the last ship in his fleet, fleeing &lt;a href=\"Tamriel\"&gt;Tamriel&lt;/a&gt; for the shores of &lt;a href=\"Atmora\"&gt;Atmora&lt;/a&gt;. From that vantage point, he watched as &lt;a href=\"Saarthal\"&gt;Saarthal&lt;/a&gt;\u2014the first city\u2014burned. A swollen sky poured rain upon the flames and upon the sea. And the greatest of us all wept bitter tears.\nSo great was the grief of the Harbinger that, instead of salty sorrow, Ysgramor wept tears of purest ebony. His eldest, &lt;a href=\"Yngol\"&gt;Yngol&lt;/a&gt;, collected the tears in a stein and held his father in a warm embrace. He poured mead down the Harbinger's great throat, wrapped furs around the Harbinger's great shoulders, and slung the Harbinger into a great hammock below decks.\nThen he set to work. For Yngol, eldest son to the Harbinger of us all, was the greatest smith our people have ever known. There, on the sea, Yngol set to work with his tools. He used lightning to heat the Night's Tears, the ocean's swell to cool them, and always his hammer-blows rang in concert with the rising wind.\nWhen Ysgramor awoke the next morning, Yngol presented him with a mighty axe, hewn from the sorrow that had laid him low just the night before. And the Harbinger of us all embraced his son. He cried out in joy, sadness, and rage. And there on the deck of the last ship from Saarthal, Ysgramor named his axe Wuuthrad, which means \"Storm's Tears\" in the language of Atmora.\nIt was then, in telling the tale, that Ysgramor paused. The Harbinger of us all called out to lost Yngol, who had been with the crew of the &lt;a href=\"Harakk\"&gt;Harakk&lt;/a&gt; in the . For his son, his eldest and greatest joy, was with him always. He who had bound the storm's tears, he said, rode with him always in the days of the noble and honored Five Hundred."}

Each ship carried a crew that performed legendary feats that could feed the pride of any nation for a thousand years. And during this time of broadening, scores of Companions wandered the land, bringing the light of the proper gods to the heathen land of &lt;a href=\"Mer\"&gt;elves&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Beastfolk\"&gt;beasts&lt;/a&gt;.\nThey were but mortal, though, and in time, all would taste the glories of &lt;a href=\"Sovngarde%20%28Location%29\"&gt;Sovngarde&lt;/a&gt;.\nIt was in one of the uncounted years after the retaking of &lt;a href=\"Saarthal\"&gt;Saarthal&lt;/a&gt; that the crew of the &lt;a href=\"Chrion\"&gt;Chrion&lt;/a&gt; was declaring their fortunes in the eastern lands near the &lt;a href=\"Red%20Mountain\"&gt;Red Mountain&lt;/a&gt;. They were encamped, surrounded by bodies of murderous elves who had attempted to make believe they held peace in their hearts. The shrewd &lt;a href=\"Rhorlak%20%28Lore%29\"&gt;Rhorlak&lt;/a&gt; was the Chrion's captain, though, and would show no quarter to the liars of the southlands, as had been commanded by his lord Ysgramor, &lt;a href=\"Harbinger%20%28Rank%29\"&gt;harbinger&lt;/a&gt; of us all.\nIt was in this state of carousing that they were approached by a young and breathless messenger of their sister crew from the &lt;a href=\"Kaal%20Kaaz\"&gt;Kaal Kaaz&lt;/a&gt;. The boy &lt;a href=\"Asgeir\"&gt;Asgeir&lt;/a&gt;, as his name is now sung, had ran unimaginable distance at breakneck speed from the blood-stained &lt;a href=\"Morrowind\"&gt;Fields of the Clouded Sun&lt;/a&gt;, to deliver the news to all who would hear. When he reached their camp, he bellowed a great sob before relieving his heart with the news that the mighty Ysgramor had breathed his last.\nAsgeir continued his swift run, to inform the other crews as quickly as they could be found, for there were many now crawling the land, rendering our legacy from their deeds, and the camp of Chrion descended into a mourning of the most forlorn sort. Among these fires sat the bravest men and fiercest women who have ever graced the dirt of this land, and they were brought low by such a notion. While we in the day-shine know only Ysgramor's glory as it gleams through history, these Companions knew his might with their own eyes, and such a loss hangs so heavily on the heart that mere words cannot express the altering of their world.\nFor indeed the stories tell that Rhorlak, the most battle-hardened and unflinching of all captains, did collapse with grief, and never lifted again his mighty axe. And all around &lt;a href=\"Tamriel\"&gt;Tamriel&lt;/a&gt;, as the news spread as a dark cloud washed from horizon to horizon, did brilliant lights go out in silent honor of their fallen general and war-leader.\nSo ended the period of the &lt;a href=\"Return\"&gt;Return&lt;/a&gt;, and the original glories of the Five Hundred Companions of Ysgramor harbinger of us all."}

The &lt;a href=\"Five%20Hundred%20Companions\"&gt;Five Hundred&lt;/a&gt; who yet stood joined in the ovation for the victory and the lament for their fallen peers. It was said to be heard on the distant and chilling green shores of &lt;a href=\"Atmora\"&gt;Atmora&lt;/a&gt; and the ancestors knew their time had come to cross the seas.\nAs the reverberations echoed out and drowned to silence, all looked to Ysgramor, who bore the blessed &lt;a href=\"Wuuthrad\"&gt;Wuuthrad&lt;/a&gt;, for his next commandment. With his lungs that bellow forth the fury of &lt;a href=\"Men\"&gt;humanity&lt;/a&gt;, he bade them to continue their march, that the devious &lt;a href=\"Mer\"&gt;Mer&lt;/a&gt; might know the terror they had brought on themselves with their trickery.\n\"Go forth,\" he roared. \"Into the belly of this new land. Drive the wretched from their palaces of idleness.\" Oblige them to squalor and foil, that they would see their betrayals as the all-sin against our kind. Give no quarter. Show no kindness. For they would not give nor show you the same.\" (Our great forebear gave this order as he did not yet understand the prophecy of the &lt;a href=\"Twin%20Snakes\"&gt;Twin Snakes&lt;/a&gt;, that he would be fated to die before seeing the true destiny of his line.)\nHearing this, the &lt;a href=\"Circle%20of%20Captains\"&gt;Circle of Captains&lt;/a&gt; gathered each their crews unto themselves. From here, they decreed, we will go forth. Let each ship's band make its own way, seeking their fates to the open sun. A night spent in feasting, the &lt;a href=\"Oath%20of%20the%20Companions\"&gt;Oath of the Companions&lt;/a&gt; was sworn anew, with each of the &lt;a href=\"Five%20Hundred%20Companions\"&gt;Five Hundred&lt;/a&gt; (so they still names their count, in honor of the shields that were broken at Saarthal) swearing to act as &lt;a href=\"Shield-Siblings\"&gt;Shield-brother&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Shield-Siblings\"&gt;Shield-sister&lt;/a&gt; to any of the &lt;a href=\"Atmora\"&gt;Atmora&lt;/a&gt;n line were their fates to ever again entwine.\nAs the red hands of dawn stretched from the east, so broke the Five Hundred Companions of Ysgramor, setting about their journeys, sailing now across the land with waves of stone and crests of trees flowing under their footed hulls.\nThe first to break from the grounded fleet was the crew of the &lt;a href=\"Jorrvaskr\"&gt;Jorrvaskr&lt;/a&gt;, who had been formed of Ysgramor's closest friends. Their &lt;a href=\"Captain%20%28Lore%29\"&gt;captain&lt;/a&gt; was known as &lt;a href=\"Jeek%20of%20the%20River\"&gt;Jeek of the River&lt;/a&gt;, so called by the &lt;a href=\"Harbinger%20%28Rank%29\"&gt;harbinger&lt;/a&gt; himself from their youths passed in glory. When assembling their glistening hull, he sought out the labors of &lt;a href=\"Menro\"&gt;Menro&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Manwe\"&gt;Manwe&lt;/a&gt;, who now bore the native timbers across this new land of &lt;a href=\"Tamriel\"&gt;Tamriel&lt;/a&gt;. Among their fiercest were &lt;a href=\"Tysnal\"&gt;Tysnal&lt;/a&gt; (Who Was Twice-Named), and &lt;a href=\"Terr\"&gt;Terr&lt;/a&gt;, his twin and Shield-Brother whose girth was never spoken of to his face. There were others, too, in their band -- &lt;a href=\"Meksim%20the%20Walker\"&gt;Meksim the Walker&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Brunl\"&gt;Brunl&lt;/a&gt; (Who Fought with his Off-Hand), and &lt;a href=\"Vust%20the%20Smiler\"&gt;Vust the Smiler&lt;/a&gt;. Those and others were sworn to Jeek, and they pushed forth into the shadows where yet the sun had not reached.\nSouthwards they went, by beast and by foot. Elves they found, though none remain to tell what those battles entailed. The numbers of the Jorrvaskr never faltered, so shrewd were they in battle, with minds as sharp as their blade.\nOnce, as the sun beat from its high-home, &lt;a href=\"Jonder%20the%20Tiny\"&gt;Jonder the Tiny&lt;/a&gt;, the one who ran ahead, came over the hill to tell what was seen. Amidst a vast plain his eyes had met a &lt;a href=\"Skyforge\"&gt;monument of a bird&lt;/a&gt;, whose eyes and beak were opened in flame. When his brothers and sisters crested the hill, they too saw its glory, but they were afraid for no elven settlement could be seen to the horizon.\n\"But this is not seemly,\" said &lt;a href=\"Kluwe\"&gt;Kluwe&lt;/a&gt;, who went by Loate when hiding his face. \"Is not &lt;a href=\"Whiterun%20Hold\"&gt;this wide land&lt;/a&gt; fit for harvest? Why have not the elves, vile to their cote, seen to exploit and tame it?\" They asked of their elven captives (for they had many) what they found unfit about these plains. Yet even the captives who still bore their tongues could say nothing of the valley. They looked with fear at the winged colossus, and from their babblings did the warriors of the Jorrvaskr learn that it was older than even the elves themselves. Of those who wrought it solid from its mother-stone, nothing could be said, but it was known to drive a magic almost as old as the &lt;a href=\"Nirn\"&gt;Nirn&lt;/a&gt; itself, some remnant of the god's efforts to render a paradise in &lt;a href=\"Mundus\"&gt;Mundus&lt;/a&gt; before the shattering of &lt;a href=\"Lorkhan\"&gt;Lorkhan&lt;/a&gt;.\nThis first of many, this crew of the Jorrvaskr, heathens and ancestors to us all, feared no stories or gods. Indeed, if there was something the elves feared, they would have it for their own. Thus began the labors, once more, of Menro and Manwe, whose eager hands again laid to the Atmoran wood which had born them all across the sea, and what was their ship became their shelter as this valley became their purview until the end of all their days.\nThus began the building of the &lt;a href=\"Whiterun\"&gt;Great City&lt;/a&gt;, circled by the running of the &lt;a href=\"White%20River\"&gt;White River&lt;/a&gt;, as brought forth by these beloved of Ysgramor, yet but twenty-two of the glamorous Five Hundred Companions."}

{"id": "877737", "revid": "32045548", "url": "https://elderscrolls.fandom.com/wiki?curid=877737", "title": "Songs of the Stars", "text": "Songs of the Stars is a &lt;a href=\"Books%20%28Online%29\"&gt;book&lt;/a&gt; in .\nContents.\nMere months ago, we were the subject of ridicule to those scant few who even recognized the name \"&lt;a href=\"Star-Gazer\"&gt;Star-Gazer&lt;/a&gt;.\" The barely concealed chuckles and eye-rolls of the inhabitants of &lt;a href=\"Belkarth%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Belkarth&lt;/a&gt; still sting. But, oh, now they flock to us, scholars and mages alike, seeking the notes and wisdom we have amassed on the topic of the stars. I should be pleased, should be eager to share our studies and invite new perspectives, but I find it hard to set aside the bitterness and scorn the years of derision have incised into my heart.\nI am one of the most experienced members of our order now. I have visited the great observatory in &lt;a href=\"Stros%20M%27Kai%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Stros M'Kai&lt;/a&gt;. I have charted the movements of the constellations every night without fail. I have seen our mighty Guardians fall from the sky\u2014and still I live, when many of my colleagues do not. Now that we have gained some degree of legitimacy within the scholarly establishment, now that I am High Astrologer, I should be at the forefront of our efforts to educate.\nBut instead, I find myself more and more withdrawn. I spend my days and nights within our archive, deep in study. If the very stars can fall from the skies and manifest physically on &lt;a href=\"Nirn\"&gt;Nirn&lt;/a&gt;, much of what we once theorized about the nature of the stars\u2014and, yes, even of the &lt;a href=\"Mundus\"&gt;Mundus&lt;/a&gt; itself\u2014is wrong, or at least far more incomplete than we could have guessed. And if it can happen once, what is stopping it from happening again? What keeps &lt;a href=\"the%20Serpent\"&gt;the Serpent&lt;/a&gt; from eclipsing every star in the sky, severing us from &lt;a href=\"Aetherius\"&gt;Aetherius&lt;/a&gt;? While the others seek mundane recognition and status, I find my soul drawn to the sky as ever, still vigilant against the dangers that prowl the emptiness.\nI must admit: there is something else. If the constellations can be realized in physical form, are our assumptions about their impact on the mortals of Nirn as shallow as I suspect? Perhaps each individual is influenced in some way by the ascendant sign during their birth, but does it work the other way around? Can one, with the right understanding and rituals, draw power from constellations that goes beyond normal magic? And what impact might this have on the Aetherial plane?\nIn my sleepless nights spent hunched over our rarest tomes (a perk of being High Astrologer), I have uncovered references, again and again, to an ancient &lt;a href=\"Dwemer\"&gt;Dwemer&lt;/a&gt; text, \"&lt;a href=\"Harmonic%20Astronymics\"&gt;Harmonic Astronymics&lt;/a&gt;.\" It may have the answers to my questions\u2014or, more likely, it may lead me to ask better-informed questions. We know the Dwemer had a greater understanding of the &lt;a href=\"Mundus\"&gt;Mundus&lt;/a&gt; than we do even now, and I cannot help but wonder if they could harness the power of the constellations in ways we cannot even imagine. If a copy of this text still exists, I must find it. But where to start\u2014and how to leave my fellow Star-Gazers in this tumultuous time?"}

It is said that long ago the very last of its kind was sacrificed to Hircine. However, rumors of sightings in Tamriel have surfaced in recent times.\nIndeed, while these claims echo mostly from taverns in the late hours, one can wonder at the validity of such claims.\nI've chronicled the habits of Mudcrabs and Rabbits long enough. This old man is quite ready for something a little more interesting.\n3rd of Second Seed, 4E 201&lt;br&gt;\nI have spoken with several hunters who swear by the Divines that they have seen a Unicorn during their travels. All have tried to approach it for a closer look, or to take it as a prize, but it has evaded them all.\nI continue my research for skepticism. If this is indeed true, how could this be? Was the last unicorn not truly the last or some other force at work?\n18th of Second Seed, 4E 201&lt;br&gt;\nWhile studying the mating habits of Salmon is certainly enlightening, I have become quite obsessed with my pursuit of the elusive Unicorn.\nI spoke with a hostler who said that during one of his horse taming expeditions he too saw something that closely resembled the fabled Unicorn, though he was unsure. He is a man of great integrity, so I took his word in good faith.\nI decided then to speak with &lt;a href=\"Tolfdir%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Tolfdir&lt;/a&gt; at the &lt;a href=\"College%20of%20Winterhold%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;College of Winterhold&lt;/a&gt;. Being a wise man with deep knowledge of such things, I hoped he might have some insight. I was correct in my assumption.\nAccording to Tolfdir, the &lt;a href=\"Psijic%20Order%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Psijic Order&lt;/a&gt; have appeared from time-to-time throughout history to assist with situations they believe are extremely important. While he cannot personally say for certain, he believes they may have intervened after the last Unicorn was sacrificed, transporting another through time in order to set right what they believed was a wrongdoing.\nI am now more motivated than ever to see this creature with my own two eyes.\n24th of Second Seed, 4E 201&lt;br&gt;\nThe last lighting of the Unicorn was rumored to be in a dense forest area near Riften. As old as I am, an energy filled my bones that I haven't felt since I was a young man.\nI hiked up the ridge of the mountains there, and set up a very small camp. I was cautious to not set any fires or make much noise, lest I scare it away.\nAfter waiting two nights, through this morning's early fog, I finally saw the majestic creature for the first time. I still cannot believe my own two eyes. It lingered long enough for me to see it clearly, its brilliant coat and distinct horn shimmering in the morning light.\nI watched this movements for nearly thirty minutes, enough time to draw a rough depiction for my library. This is absolutely the crowning achievement of my scholarly life.\nI've decided to turn this information over to the College of Winterhold rather than publish it to the general population. I would like to ensure this creature remain protected, and I believe they are the most capable of such a task."}

This can be used to gain an extra &lt;a href=\"Fortify%20Magicka%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;Fortify Magicka&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Enchanting%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;enchantment&lt;/a&gt;, or a shield enchantment to maximize armor ratings.

Players should still make use of the defensive techniques employed by mages to keep alive, rarely relying on armor."}

They do not regenerate &lt;a href=\"Magicka%20%28Daggerfall%29\"&gt;magicka&lt;/a&gt; naturally within their bodies, but absorb it from the spells of others. Their total magicka \"pool\" is much greater than the mage's - indeed they have the greatest magical potential of any of the standard character classes. Like their brother mages, sorcerors must have high &lt;a href=\"intelligence%20%28Daggerfall%29\"&gt;intelligence&lt;/a&gt; and high &lt;a href=\"Willpower%20%28Daggerfall%29\"&gt;willpower&lt;/a&gt;.\nDescription and use.\nSorcerors are more of a risky bet than other magic-based classes, due to the fact that they can not naturally regenerate magicka. However, they also have the potential to be one of the most powerful classes in the game.\nWhen they are hit by a spell, they may absorb the magicka from the spell and take no damage. This depends on whether or not the sorceror can absorb the amount of magicka or not. If, for example, they were hit by a &lt;a href=\"Fireball%20%28Daggerfall%29\"&gt;fireball&lt;/a&gt;, then if they have lost enough magicka so that absorbing the spell would not give them more magicka than their maximum pool, then they would likely absorb the spell. If, however, they cannot absorb the spell without increasing their maximum magicka, then they will be hit by the spell.\nThis means that when a sorceror is fighting other spellcasters, then they can use all of their magicka up quickly, and then easily regain it without taking very much, if any, damage.\nMagicka can still be regained by other means, such as potions and visiting the &lt;a href=\"Mages%20Guild%20%28Daggerfall%29\"&gt;Mages Guild&lt;/a&gt;."}

Thus I can tell you with the authority of personal experience that petty local officials, regardless of race or culture, are universally suspicious and ill-informed. \"A Sorcerer, eh?\" they say, \"Well, we'll have none of your raising the dead in this jurisdiction, is that understood?\"\nI cannot tell you how many times I have been subjected to some variation of the above conversation. These ignorant and self-important functionaries have no conception whatsoever of distinctions within the arcane arts. As far as they are concerned, every manipulator of &lt;a href=\"Magic\"&gt;Magic&lt;/a&gt;ka is just waiting for midnight before skulking off to the cemetery to animate the corpses of their neighbors and ancestors.\nImbeciles. Fools. BUREAUCRATS.\nNow, it is true, of course, that &lt;a href=\"conjuration\"&gt;conjuration&lt;/a&gt; is a common tool of sorcery, and we sorcerers often resort to summoning aid from &lt;a href=\"Oblivion%20%28Realm%29\"&gt;Oblivion&lt;/a&gt; when a problem is best solved by judicious application of vicious brute force. It is also true that summoning &lt;a href=\"Daedra%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Daedric&lt;/a&gt; spirits to posses and animate corpses, or calling up the souls of the dead for information or other services-in short, necromancy- is a subset of the art of conjuration, albeit inherently distasteful and degrading. However, to infer from this that all sorcerers are de facto necromancers as well is false, misleading and libelous.\nThat said, everyone was young once, and it's typical of youth to experiment with things dangerous and forbidden. It is long since I was a lad in &lt;a href=\"Tel%20Aruhn\"&gt;Tel Aruhn&lt;/a&gt;, and my memory of the early &lt;a href=\"First%20Era\"&gt;First Era&lt;/a&gt; is inexact, but it's just possible that as an apprentice I may have tried out and animation spell or two\u2013never on corpses of anyone I knew, of course (or at least, nobody I knew well), and never for long. To my recollection.\nSo, at any rate, I know whereof I speak when I say to you: sorcery and necromancy-there IS a difference."}

She becomes the &lt;a href=\"Weapons%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;weapons&lt;/a&gt; specialist in the &lt;a href=\"Dawnguard%20%28Faction%29\"&gt;Dawnguard&lt;/a&gt;, mainly in &lt;a href=\"Crossbows%20%28Dawnguard%29\"&gt;crossbows&lt;/a&gt;. She uses her knowledge on Dwemer technology to aid in upgrading the Dawnguard's crossbows and bolts.\nBackground.\nShe was an old associate of &lt;a href=\"Isran\"&gt;Isran&lt;/a&gt; many years ago, but left on bad terms when he made it clear he didn't need her help any longer. After she left, she pursued her interest in Dwemer technology and was last reported to being somewhere in &lt;a href=\"The%20Reach\"&gt;The Reach&lt;/a&gt;, attempting to uncover a large &lt;a href=\"Dwemer%20Ruins%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Dwemer ruin&lt;/a&gt;.\nInteractions.\n&lt;a href=\"A%20New%20Order\"&gt;A New Order&lt;/a&gt;.\nIsran tasks the &lt;a href=\"Last%20Dragonborn\"&gt;Dragonborn&lt;/a&gt; to recruit Sorine into the Dawnguard. She can be found west of &lt;a href=\"Druadach%20Redoubt%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Druadach Redoubt&lt;/a&gt; and south of &lt;a href=\"Darkfall%20Cave\"&gt;Darkfall Cave&lt;/a&gt;, at the unmarked location . When first met she complains that she cannot find her satchel of Dwarven gyros and suspects that &lt;a href=\"Mudcrab%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;mudcrabs&lt;/a&gt; may have stolen them. She asks the Dragonborn to retrieve either the stolen sack or find a single gyro for her. Upon completion of the quest, she can be found at &lt;a href=\"Fort%20Dawnguard\"&gt;Fort Dawnguard&lt;/a&gt;, having traded her &lt;a href=\"Leather%20Armor%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;leather armor&lt;/a&gt; in for &lt;a href=\"Dawnguard%20Armor\"&gt;Dawnguard Armor&lt;/a&gt;.\n&lt;a href=\"Ancient%20Technology\"&gt;Ancient Technology&lt;/a&gt;.\nSorine will explain that she has located a schematic that can provide a new upgrade or ammunition type for the &lt;a href=\"Crossbows%20%28Dawnguard%29\"&gt;crossbow&lt;/a&gt;. She asks the Dragonborn to retrieve it from a radiant location, typically a &lt;a href=\"Dwemer%20Ruins\"&gt;Dwarven Ruin&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"Bandits%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Bandit&lt;/a&gt; stronghold. Once the schematic has been delivered, she will teach the Dragonborn how to craft the item, provided the corresponding &lt;a href=\"Smithing%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Smithing&lt;/a&gt; perk has been unlocked. Access to additional weaponry and ammunition will be granted for the Dragonborn, though none of the Dawnguard will be seen taking advantage of this as well.\nFort Dawnguard.\nAt Fort Dawnguard, she serves as a &lt;a href=\"General%20Goods%20Merchants%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;general goods merchant&lt;/a&gt;, and notably sells around 200 &lt;a href=\"Steel%20Bolt%20%28Dawnguard%29\"&gt;steel bolts&lt;/a&gt; at a time. She can also provide &lt;a href=\"Trainers%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;training&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Archery%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Archery&lt;/a&gt; to the master level. Once her \"&lt;a href=\"Ancient%20Technology\"&gt;Ancient Technology&lt;/a&gt;\" quests are completed, she will start selling the new weapons and ammunition in her inventory.\nVampire exploit.\nIt is possible for the Dragonborn to acquire a large number of steel bolts from her even if they sided with the &lt;a href=\"Volkihar%20Clan%20%28Dawnguard%29\"&gt;vampires&lt;/a&gt; by using the following exploit. First, the quest \"&lt;a href=\"Destroying%20the%20Dawnguard\"&gt;Destroying the Dawnguard&lt;/a&gt;\" must be active. Before going to the fort, however, create a &lt;a href=\"Potions%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;potion&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"Fortify%20Illusion\"&gt;Fortify Illusion&lt;/a&gt;. Now go inside the fort, drink the potion, and cast the Master-level spell &lt;a href=\"Harmony%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Harmony&lt;/a&gt;. If the potion is powerful enough, the Dawnguard will not fight the Dragonborn and will, moreover, allow them to talk and shop with them. This exploit can be used to buy an &lt;a href=\"Armored%20Troll\"&gt;Armored Troll&lt;/a&gt;, a crossbow, bolts, and &lt;a href=\"Spell%20Tomes%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Spell Tomes&lt;/a&gt; that are otherwise exclusive to the Dawnguard.\nConversations.\nGunmar: \"All right Isran, you've got us all here. Now what do you want?\"\nIsran: \"Hold it right there.\"\nSorine: \"What are you doing?\"\nIsran: \"Making sure you're not vampires. Can't be too careful. So, welcome to Fort Dawnguard. I'm sure you've heard a bit of what we're up against. Powerful vampires, unlike anything we've seen before. And they have an Elder Scroll. If anyone is going to stand in their way, it's going to be us.\"\nSorine: \"This is all well and good, but do we actually know anything about what they're doing? What do we do now?\"\nIsran: \"We'll get to that. For now, get acquainted with the space. Sorine, you'll find room to start your tinkering on that crossbow design you've been working on. Gunmar, there's an area large enough for you to pen up some trolls, get them armored up and ready for use. In the meantime, we're going to get to the bottom of why a vampire showed up here looking for . Let's go have a little chat with it, shall we?\"\nIsran: \"Everyone! Gather 'round! Come on then, we haven't got all day! For too long we've allowed these vampires to poison the night and kill our people! Now, we finally have the means to strike back! We now have Auriel's Bow. The gods themselves have favored us and we must answer with action! The time has come to finally put an end to Harkon and his unholy prophecy! We will march on their lair and destroy those wretched abominations so they can no longer corrupt our world! This is our fight and this is our fate! This is the time of the Dawnguard!\"\nFlorentius: \"Burn them all!\"\nCelann: \"Kill the abominations!\"\nAgmaer: \"Victory to the Dawnguard!\"\nSorine: \"Give him a crossbow bolt between the eyes for me!\"\nBeleval: \"Send the troll after them!\"\nGunmar: \"Send them to Oblivion!\"\nFlorentius: \"Praise Arkay!\"\nDurak: \"The prophecy is no more!\""}

He will tell you that he and Lady Laurent have been hired by the &lt;a href=\"House%20of%20Orsimer%20Glories\"&gt;House of Orsimer Glories&lt;/a&gt; to find an ancient relic at the mountain's peak, the armlet of &lt;a href=\"Torug%20gro-Igron\"&gt;Torug gro-Igron&lt;/a&gt;, but there have been problems reaching it. He will direct you to go speak to Lady Laurent yourself. \nLady Laurent will be up the path to the south. She will tell you tat all her expeditions up the mountain have ended in failure so far, and will direct you to speak to a man named Kharsthun, further up the mountain. Climb further up the path; you will be set upon by harpies along the way, so dispose of those. Eventually, you will reach the gates to the &lt;a href=\"Path%20to%20Sorrow\"&gt;Path to Sorrow&lt;/a&gt;; head through and meet Kharsthun at the far side of the hall. \nKharsthun is a representative of the House of Orsimer Glories. He will warn you of the dangers ahead, including freezing cold and avalanches. He lost contact with most of his crew on the mountain, so he will ask you to check whether they are still alive while you are up there. Once you are done talking, head through the door to Sorrow proper. Proceed up the path, but watch out for avalanches. The places where avalanches can occur are marked with flags; these avalanches can easily push you off the mountain and kill you. At the bend of the road, head off the beaten path to the south and you will find a survivor, &lt;a href=\"Kuhlon\"&gt;Kuhlon&lt;/a&gt;. Her legs are broken and she is dying; there is nothing you can do for her. \nContinue further up the path until you have crossed the bridge, then head into the cave to your left. When the cave splits into two paths, take the left path to find the expedition team. They are all dead, but one of the bodies is carrying a rubbing of an inscription they found a bit further ahead. The moment you examine this, Kharsthun will show up; speak with him and he will tell you that this is one of three stanzas of Torug's epitaph. If you can find the other two, you might be able to use them to find the Armlet. \nProceed through the cave and further up the mountain. At the top of the big stairs, you will find Torug's shrine, alongside the inscription you just found. Head inside and on to the big room, where you will find the second stanza. Kharsthun, Lady Laurent and Stibbons will be right behind you. Continue up the path to reach the third inscription. Kharsthun will translate all of the text; Torug disapproved of the construction of this shrine and instead climbed all the way to the summit of the mountain to die there, taking the armlet with him. Stibbons will express his doubts about part of the translation, but Lady Laurent will dismiss his concerns. Speak with Lady Laurent about this and she will task you with climbing to the top of the mountain to retrieve the armlet. \nHead out the door to Sorrow's Peak, but watch out for avalanches there. You will find three frozen orcs there, one of which will be wearing the Armlet of Torug. The moment you take it, you will collapse; when you wake up, you will find that Kharsthun, Lady Laurent and Stibbons have saved you. Kharsthun seems to disapprove of something Lady Laurent has planned; speak with Stibbons and he will tell you that Laurent and Kharsthun disagree on what should be done with the armlet. Kharsthun thinks it belongs in the shrine, while Lady Laurent wants to take it to the museum. Stibbons will now take the armlet off you while you talk to the others.\nIt is up to you to choose what happens to the relic. Talk to the person you agree with, and promise them the relic. Afterward, Stibbons will try out what happens if you put the armlet on, and he will promptly freeze. Talk to Lady Laurent hereafter and she will assure you that she will get someone from the Mages Guild to warm Stibbons up again. This will finish the quest. Afterward, Lady Laurent will open a portal to allow you to get back down the mountain."}

{"id": "1553", "revid": "29845234", "url": "https://elderscrolls.fandom.com/wiki?curid=1553", "title": "Sotha Sil", "text": "Sotha Sil, also called Lord Seht, was one of the members of the &lt;a href=\"Tribunal\"&gt;Tribunal&lt;/a&gt;, the divine rulers of &lt;a href=\"Morrowind\"&gt;Morrowind&lt;/a&gt;. For his feats, Sotha Sil was called an architect of time, a binder of &lt;a href=\"Oblivion%20%28Realm%29\"&gt;Oblivion&lt;/a&gt;, and the \"Mystery of Morrowind.\" He is known by many other titles, such as the Clockwork God, Father of Mysteries, the Inspiration of Craft and Sorcery, the Light of Knowledge, Magus, Magician, Sorcerer, Tinkerer, the \"si\" in &lt;a href=\"ALMSIVI\"&gt;ALMSIVI&lt;/a&gt;, and later a Saint of the &lt;a href=\"New%20Temple\"&gt;New Temple&lt;/a&gt;.\nHe was said to be reshaping the world from his hidden &lt;a href=\"Clockwork%20City\"&gt;Clockwork City&lt;/a&gt;. Sotha Sil the Magus was one of the three God-like Kings of Morrowind, a Pillar of the &lt;a href=\"Tribunal%20Temple\"&gt;Tribunal Temple&lt;/a&gt;, and the patron of &lt;a href=\"Imperfect\"&gt;artificers&lt;/a&gt; and wizards. Sotha Sil was the mightiest wizard and the wisest councilor of the &lt;a href=\"First%20Council\"&gt;First Council&lt;/a&gt;, and also spent time training the &lt;a href=\"Psijic%20Order\"&gt;Psijic Order&lt;/a&gt; on &lt;a href=\"Artaeum\"&gt;Artaeum&lt;/a&gt;. He was the companion and teacher of &lt;a href=\"Vivec\"&gt;Vivec&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Nerevar\"&gt;Nerevar&lt;/a&gt;. According to the Tribunal Temple Cult, Sotha Sil was the Light of Knowledge and the Inspiration of Craft and Sorcery, and &lt;a href=\"Azura\"&gt;Azura&lt;/a&gt; was the Anticipation of Sotha Sil.\nHistory.\nEarly life.\nSotha Sil was born a &lt;a href=\"Chimer\"&gt;Chimer&lt;/a&gt; to the small house of &lt;a href=\"House%20Sotha\"&gt;Sotha&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Ald%20Sotha\"&gt;Ald Sotha&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Resdayn\"&gt;Resdayn&lt;/a&gt;, now known as &lt;a href=\"Morrowind\"&gt;Morrowind&lt;/a&gt;. He was known to have had a mother, whose name is unknown, and a sister, &lt;a href=\"Sotha%20Nall%20%28Character%29\"&gt;Sotha Nall&lt;/a&gt;. From one of his memories, Sotha Sil's mother comforted the young boy after he had sustained a minor injury, using the childhood nursery tale of the \"&lt;a href=\"Brave%20Little%20Scrib\"&gt;Brave Little Scrib&lt;/a&gt;\" to inspire courage in him. Another memory involved his sister, Nall, trying to convince Sil to enter an off-limits area, an idea that Sil was hesitant towards.\nAccording to one of Almalexia's homilies, a young Sotha Sil was playing in a &lt;a href=\"Kwama\"&gt;Kwama&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Mines%20%28Morrowind%29\"&gt;Egg Mine&lt;/a&gt; as a child, throwing stones at small &lt;a href=\"scrib\"&gt;scrib&lt;/a&gt;s for amusement. One scrib lifted its head up and begged Sotha Sil to stop, telling him that for them, it was suffering and death when they were hit by the stones. This taught the young Chimer that what are idle amusements of one can be solemn tortures for another. Another homily tells of young Sotha laying down and gazing at the &lt;a href=\"Magna%20Ge\"&gt;stars&lt;/a&gt; at night. In his passion for maths, Sil decided to count every star and give each of them a name, eventually falling asleep. When he awoke, he saw that the stars had vanished, and began to weep, learning the lesson that time cages all tasks.\nFor unknown reasons, the Daedric Prince &lt;a href=\"Mehrunes%20Dagon\"&gt;Mehrunes Dagon&lt;/a&gt; arrived in Ald Sotha during Sotha Sil's youth and destroyed it, killing everyone in it including Sil's family. Sotha Sil was the only survivor of the attack, as &lt;a href=\"Vivec\"&gt;Vivec&lt;/a&gt; was said to have rescued him.\nAdvisorship.\nAt some point he became an advisor to &lt;a href=\"Nerevar\"&gt;Nerevar&lt;/a&gt;, his wife &lt;a href=\"Almalexia\"&gt;Almalexia&lt;/a&gt;, and his generals. He had a number of students and companions studying under him, such as &lt;a href=\"Farena%20Andrano\"&gt;Farena Andrano&lt;/a&gt;. During the first Battle of the Red Mountain, Sotha Sil helped drive the &lt;a href=\"Nord\"&gt;Nord&lt;/a&gt; people from Morrowind using his skills in sorcery, accompanied by Nerevar's forces and King Dumac's Dwemer army. After this, the First Council was formed. During this time Sotha Sil was praised for his diplomatic skill and was known as the greatest wizard of his time. Tensions soon grew between the two races after High Tonal Architect &lt;a href=\"Kagrenac\"&gt;Kagrenac&lt;/a&gt; secretly attempted to transcend the Dwemer race to godhood. Due to this Nerevar declared war on the entire Dwemer and the War of the First Council began. During the war, Sotha Sil was named a general of the chimer army and alongside Vivec, Nerevar and Almalexia battled king Dumac and Kagrenac in the bowels of the Red Mountain. During this battle, Dumac was killed. Kagrenac used &lt;a href=\"Keening\"&gt;Keening&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Sunder\"&gt;Sunder&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Wraithguard\"&gt;Wraithguard&lt;/a&gt; on the Heart of Lorkhan, making the entire Dwemer race vanish off the face of &lt;a href=\"Nirn\"&gt;Nirn&lt;/a&gt;. \nWar of the First Council.\nAfter the &lt;a href=\"Battle%20of%20Red%20Mountain\"&gt;Battle of Red Mountain&lt;/a&gt;, Sotha Sil learned how to use &lt;a href=\"Kagrenac%27s%20Tools\"&gt;Kagrenac's Tools&lt;/a&gt; so that a mortal could tap the divine power within the &lt;a href=\"Heart%20of%20Lorkhan\"&gt;Heart&lt;/a&gt; and turn themselves into a god. Nerevar forbade this divine manipulation and forced the Tribunal to make an oath not to use it. Nerevar then entrusted Kagrenac's tools to Voryn Dagoth (who would later become &lt;a href=\"Dagoth%20Ur%20%28Character%29\"&gt;Dagoth Ur&lt;/a&gt;) while he and his advisors convened on what to do with the Heart of Lorkhan. When Sotha Sil, Vivec and Almalexia returned to lock the tools away from the world, Voryn, who had been corrupted by the Heart, refused to give Kagrenac's Tools to Nerevar. He believed that he was entrusted to hold them and, in his madness, attacked Nerevar and his companions. During this battle, Nerevar was killed and Dagoth Ur retreated into the bowels of the Red Mountain.\nThe death of Nerevar caused the Tribunal to make use of the Heart for the good of their people, the &lt;a href=\"Chimer\"&gt;Chimer&lt;/a&gt;. They went to &lt;a href=\"Red%20Mountain\"&gt;Red Mountain&lt;/a&gt; and used the tools to transform themselves into gods. &lt;a href=\"Azura\"&gt;Azura&lt;/a&gt; cursed them for breaking their oath to &lt;a href=\"Nerevar\"&gt;Nerevar&lt;/a&gt; and establishing a new religion by forsaking any connection with the &lt;a href=\"Daedra\"&gt;Daedra&lt;/a&gt;. During this confrontation Sotha Sil taunted Azura, telling her that the Chimer did not need the Daedra anymore. Enraged by the Tribunal's betrayal, Azura cursed almost the entire Chimer race. From that moment on, the Chimer were known as the &lt;a href=\"Dunmer\"&gt;Dunmer&lt;/a&gt;, their skin turned ashen, and their eyes turned red.\nFour Score War.\nDuring the &lt;a href=\"Four%20Score%20War\"&gt;Four Score War&lt;/a&gt; with the &lt;a href=\"Reman%20Empire\"&gt;Reman Empire&lt;/a&gt;, the Tribunal used many tactics previously used in the war between the Chimer and the Dwemer, which seemed to work in the beginning. The war was brought to a conclusion by the &lt;a href=\"Morag%20Tong\"&gt;Morag Tong&lt;/a&gt; who assassinated &lt;a href=\"Reman%20Cyrodiil%20III\"&gt;King Reman Cyrodiil III&lt;/a&gt; in 1E 2920.\nTime in the Isles and Coldharbour Compact.\nDuring the end of the First Era, at &lt;a href=\"1E%202920\"&gt;1E 2920&lt;/a&gt;, Sotha Sil spent some time on the &lt;a href=\"Artaeum\"&gt;Isle of Artaeum&lt;/a&gt; and as a member of the &lt;a href=\"Psijic%20Order\"&gt;Psijic Order&lt;/a&gt;, taught some of the new mages in sorcery and all forms of magic.\nAfter a daedric disaster at the village of &lt;a href=\"Gil-Var-Delle\"&gt;Gil-Var-Delle&lt;/a&gt; (caused by Molag Bal), Sotha Sil at the urging of Almalexia journeyed into &lt;a href=\"Oblivion%20%28Realm%29\"&gt;Oblivion&lt;/a&gt; via &lt;a href=\"The%20Dreaming%20Cave\"&gt;The Dreaming Cave&lt;/a&gt;, and issued a meeting in &lt;a href=\"Coldharbour\"&gt;Coldharbour&lt;/a&gt; with the eight most prominent Daedric Princes: &lt;a href=\"Molag%20Bal\"&gt;Molag Bal&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Boethiah\"&gt;Boethiah&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Azura\"&gt;Azura&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Hircine\"&gt;Hircine&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Hermaeus%20Mora\"&gt;Hermaeus Mora&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Malacath\"&gt;Malacath&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Sheogorath\"&gt;Sheogorath&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Mehrunes%20Dagon\"&gt;Mehrunes Dagon&lt;/a&gt;. Although the exact terms of the pact are unknown to most of the inhabitants of &lt;a href=\"Tamriel\"&gt;Tamriel&lt;/a&gt;, what is known is that the Princes had agreed not to answer any summoning by any amateurs until the war between Morrowind and the &lt;a href=\"Reman%20Empire\"&gt;Reman Empire&lt;/a&gt; ended. Only the &lt;a href=\"Psijic%20Order\"&gt;Psijics&lt;/a&gt; could counsel with the daedra, along with a few nomadic sorcerers and witches.\nSack of Mournhold.\nSotha Sil's pact with the Daedric Princes failed to prevent the destruction of &lt;a href=\"Mournhold\"&gt;Mournhold&lt;/a&gt;, as a Dunmer witch named Turala managed to summon &lt;a href=\"Mehrunes%20Dagon\"&gt;Mehrunes Dagon&lt;/a&gt;, and asked for its destruction. Sotha Sil and &lt;a href=\"Almalexia\"&gt;Almalexia&lt;/a&gt; were too late to prevent the destruction, but after fighting countless hordes of &lt;a href=\"Dremora\"&gt;Dremora&lt;/a&gt;, they managed to banish the prince of destruction back to Oblivion. Although Mehrunes Dagon had been defeated, Mournhold had all but been destroyed.\nThe Three Banners War.\nSotha Sil had a few assistants in the Second Era, the most notable being &lt;a href=\"Barilzar\"&gt;Barilzar&lt;/a&gt;, who later retired from his service. During the &lt;a href=\"Three%20Banners%20War\"&gt;Three Banners War&lt;/a&gt; and Molag Bal's &lt;a href=\"Planemeld\"&gt;invasion&lt;/a&gt; of Tamriel, Sotha Sil was often travelling, with not even Vivec knowing where he was. In the city of &lt;a href=\"Ebonheart\"&gt;Ebonheart&lt;/a&gt;, the populace turned to &lt;a href=\"Disciple%20Sildras\"&gt;Disciple Sildras&lt;/a&gt; for comfort due to an expected attack by the &lt;a href=\"Daggerfall%20Covenant\"&gt;Daggerfall Covenant&lt;/a&gt;. Sildras, however, had begun to lose faith in the Tribunal's protection of the city. This was not until the &lt;a href=\"Vestige\"&gt;Vestige&lt;/a&gt; came and at Sildras's urging prayed at the shrines to the three gods. During this time, the Vestige encountered the &lt;a href=\"Servant%20of%20Sotha%20Sil\"&gt;Servant of Sotha Sil&lt;/a&gt;, an apparition sent by the god to communicate with his worshippers.\n&lt;a href=\"Varen%20Aquilarios\"&gt;Varen Aquilarios&lt;/a&gt; also warned the Vestige that a war involving the Daedric Princes would occur when Sotha Sil opened the gates to his &lt;a href=\"Clockwork%20City\"&gt;Clockwork City&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href=\"Clavicus%20Vile\"&gt;Clavicus Vile&lt;/a&gt;, one of the princes not bound by the Coldharbour Compact, made a deal to give Sotha Sil's staff &lt;a href=\"Sunna%27rah\"&gt;Sunna'rah&lt;/a&gt; to the later &lt;a href=\"Failed%20Incarnate\"&gt;Failed Incarnate&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Conoon%20Chodala\"&gt;Conoon Chodala&lt;/a&gt;, who used it to steal Vivec's divine energy. &lt;a href=\"Barbas\"&gt;Barbas&lt;/a&gt; later took the staff and used Vivec's stolen power to travel to the Clockwork City, but was successfully stopped by the Vestige and &lt;a href=\"Barilzar\"&gt;Barilzar&lt;/a&gt;.\nTroubles of the Tribunal and return of Dagoth Ur.\nIn &lt;a href=\"3E%20417\"&gt;3E 417&lt;/a&gt;, Almalexia and Sotha Sil visited the Red Mountain for their annual divine bath. The reawakened leaders of the Sixth House and Dagoth Ur ambushed them and stole two of Kagrenac's Tools, &lt;a href=\"Keening\"&gt;Keening&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Sunder\"&gt;Sunder&lt;/a&gt;.\nVivec rescued Almalexia and Sotha Sil, but failing to recover Keening and Sunder, and the Tribunal retreated from Red Mountain in disorder. The Tribunal grew weaker without access to the Heart. During this time a citizen of the empire bearing the signs of Nerevar reincarnated appeared. This citizen continued to exhibit more and more of the specific criteria of the Nerevarine, and eventually rallied the three great houses &lt;a href=\"House%20Hlaalu\"&gt;House Hlaalu&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"House%20Redoran\"&gt;House Redoran&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"House%20Telvanni\"&gt;House Telvanni&lt;/a&gt; and defeated Dagoth Ur while severing the Heart from the mortal plane.\nLater Life and Death.\nLater in life, it is believed that Sotha Sil grew weary of mortal imperfections, and retired to his &lt;a href=\"Clockwork%20City\"&gt;Clockwork City&lt;/a&gt;. It is here where he reshaped life\u2014some say the world\u2014into an image he found pleasing.\nSotha Sil died at the hands of his long-time friend and fellow Tribunal member, Almalexia. In madness, she, after losing her godhood due to the releasing of the &lt;a href=\"Heart%20of%20Lorkhan\"&gt;Heart of Lorkhan&lt;/a&gt; by the &lt;a href=\"Nerevarine\"&gt;Nerevarine&lt;/a&gt;, transported herself to the &lt;a href=\"Clockwork%20City\"&gt;Clockwork City&lt;/a&gt; by using &lt;a href=\"Barilzar\"&gt;Barilzar&lt;/a&gt;'s &lt;a href=\"Mazed%20Band\"&gt;Mazed Band&lt;/a&gt; and slew him. Even as he died, he kept his silence, much to the chagrin and further provocation of Almalexia. His charred, limbless corpse can be found in . Following the Red Year, Sotha Sil, alongside the rest of the Tribunal, were relegated to the status of Saints in the new Dunmeri Pantheon.\nLegacy.\nInitially, no one believed the Nerevarine when they told them about Sotha Sil and Almalexia's death, other than &lt;a href=\"Helseth%20Hlaalu\"&gt;Helseth Hlaalu&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Barenziah\"&gt;Barenziah&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Vivec\"&gt;Vivec&lt;/a&gt;. In &lt;a href=\"3E%20433\"&gt;3E 433&lt;/a&gt;, most of the &lt;a href=\"Redoran\"&gt;Redoran&lt;/a&gt; and the Temple believed that Sotha Sil still lived and considered it heretical to suggest otherwise. After the collapse of the Tribunal temple, Sotha Sil was renamed a saint, alongside Vivec and Almalexia in the &lt;a href=\"New%20Temple\"&gt;New Temple&lt;/a&gt; religion, and was believed to be either dead or have disappeared by the citizens of Morrowind. His body was retrieved by Vivec, who interred him and Almalexia in the proper Velothi fashion. He was succeeded by his cosmic daughter, named Memory.\nPersonality.\nIn life, Sotha Sil, spent time counseling, guiding, and protecting mortals, and was known to love them perhaps more than either Vivec or Almalexia. Sotha Sil was said to have felt the stress of each of his people, but gave them no more load than he knew they could bear. He was close to Almalexia and Vivec as Vivec called him a \"brother\" during his conversations with the Nerevarine and when Almalexia arrived in Artaeum, she embraced Sotha Sil when she saw him. Eventually, He became almost completely detached from the real world after the loss of Sunder and Keening. He slowly lost touch with the affairs of the Dunmer, the rest of his fellow Tribunal, and eventually all of Tamriel. Almalexia had falsely proclaimed that Sotha Sil had gone mad after killing him, as to attribute the Fabricant attacks on Mournhold to him.\nSotha Sil shows strong signs of determinism, believing that his actions are already set in time, no matter the morals of his actions, since they are inevitable. Because of this, he feels almost trapped, but does not consider himself a prisoner since he cannot see a way out of this logic. While differently from Vivec and Almalexia he does not see himself as a god, he gazes upon existence with admiration and puts effort into perfecting everything he can no matter what role he must take, being watchful of every detail reality can offer and its implications in the past and future.\nPhysical appearance.\nIn &lt;a href=\"1E%202920\"&gt;1E 2920&lt;/a&gt;, Sotha Sil had the appearance of a Dunmer in a white cloak, and was known to have maintained this apparel in &lt;a href=\"2E%20583\"&gt;2E 583&lt;/a&gt;. Sil was rather tall for the average Dunmer, towering above even most Altmer. He wore a mask with three large spikes protruding from its top that covered most of the left side of his face, yet left the rest of it exposed. His left arm was replaced by an advanced robotic limb, and he wore light metallic pauldrons on his shoulders, yet often walked around barefoot.\nBy &lt;a href=\"3E%20427\"&gt;3E 427&lt;/a&gt;, Sil had his lower body replaced by machinery, with multiple wires and cords keeping him held up."}

Trust not the words of a poet, as he is born to seduce. Yet for poetry to the heart, it must ring with the chimes of truth.\nIs the Lady Almalexia a god? As surely as is Lord Vivec.\nAlmalexia is a warrior. Beware the warrior, as her steel may not distinguish friend from foe. But in a true hand, a sharp blade may carve history.\nAgain you ask, am I a god?\nI am Sotha Sil. I am the Mage. I am the Clockmaker.\nYou ask where my Clockwork City is? Some say in the swamps of Black Marsh. Others claim it is deep in the ground beneath Ebonheart. I have even heard it told that my city is contained within a jar on the Lady Almalexia's mantle. These are all true, and false. My city is where I live, and I live in my city. Its location is unimportant, as I am its only citizen.\nThe Dwemer were the Dwemer. The Chimer were the Chimer. Now the Dwemer are gone and the Chimer are changed. Azura's words weigh heavy, but we have discussed the words of gods already, have we not?\nI am Sotha Sil.\nI watch. I wonder. I build. I tear down.\nSotha Sil: 2002-09-19.\nThieves? An interesting concept. Did we steal the essence of the Divine, or was it given to us freely, that we might lead our people into a new age?\nFew called us thieves when by words and by rite the Princes of Oblivion were bound to a truce. Fewer still when Mehrunes Dagon broke that truce and himself was broken on the soil of Mournhold.\nThe events of Red Mountain happened so long ago. What has Lord Vivec told you about that day? Did he wrap it in riddles, give you an array of possible pasts all leading to the same inevitable future? That is his way.\nDo not curse him for this, as this is what he is. A puzzle. The opposition to his own viewpoint.\nAlmalexia would tell the story best, I think. She of us all was the closest to Nerevar. Lover. Counsel. General.

Even gods dislike the absolute, for it stinks of something larger than themselves.\nStill I watch.\nDivayth Fyr the Psijic: 2002-09-19.\nUpon arriving at my tower, I was informed by one of my wives that a discussion has taken place without my . Bear with me, for my long journey has left me weary.\nAnd so, the debate over the Tribunal, Kagrenac's tools, and the Dwemer has arisen once again! My dear up-and-coming scholars, the facts are there! Can you not see the truth? Allow me to prod a bit on your senses in order to bring some light into this topic.\nThe Tribunal...Vivec, Almalexia, and Sotha Sil are God heroes, are they not? Self made upon using Kagrenac's tools (which I will discuss in a bit) upon Lorkhan's Heart. Azura punished them, and their peoples (yes, including me!). The dark skin and fiery eyes is a visible and alarming reminder. Is this coincidence that the change happened upon the breaking of the oath? Azura is indeed the culprit. Had the \"Tribunal\" not undergone this deed, Azura would have taken no action. Did Azura take the lives of the Dwemer for use of the Heart? A question that only the Goddess can answer, but I do not believe so. Nobody knows what plans Kagrenac had for the Heart. Perhaps Kagrenac's use of the Heart was the undoing of the Dwemer. Either by plan or by mistake. This is of little concern to the Tribunal. They got what they came for. To walk in the \"Shadows of Gods\". To send their general off to a Battle and recover their prize. Nerevar was, in my opinion, expendable, to them. Nerevar would know the truth behind the Dwemer and the Tribunal hunger for Power. This brings me to another matter... did Nerevar indeed die of his wounds, or did the Tribunal fear his of the truth, and silence him, forever? Surely the Tribunal and Azura would know. Azura was quite fond of Nerevar, and it is possible that *IF* the Tribunal did exterminate Nerevar, Azura cursed the Tribunal and the chimer for this. The Dissident Priests seem to believe this aspect, as do I.\nKagrenac's Tools...Keening, Sunder, and Wraithguard. The very same tools that Kagrenac designed and constructed to harness the Power of the Heart. Can these tools also be used to destroy the Heart? Are they intended to send the Heart back to origin? Or are they simply used as tools to draw forth Power for individual consumption? Well, we know how the Tribunal used them. The mystery is, what were Kagrenac's plans for them? Sotha Sil was able to decipher their use for tapping into the Power. The Tribunal paid a visit to Red mountain with the Tools and did just that, thus, becoming \"God-Men\".\nThe Dwemer...First and foremost, one must ask themselves, were the dwemer a carefree or a careless race? Were they tolerable or were they tyrants? Did they create machines of offensive or defensive? What *IS* known is, they were great inventors of machine and construct. Magic was not favored by them, but it is rumored that there was some practice within their numbers. Did the Tribunal fear them? We know that in order for the Tribunal to gain their \"God-Men\" Power, they had to defeat the Dwemer to recover what they had in their possession. It is not very likely that the Tribunal feared the Dwemer, they simply feared what the dwemer could become. , an entire race that was as poswerful as the small Tribunal would be quite a power to be with.\nTheir disappearance is still a mystery that grows deeper and deeper with every step taken forward. We know that *ALL* Dwemer (with the exception of my good friend Yagrum) vanished when Kagrenac struck the Heart with his tools. Where they went is the true mystery. Many theories say they were transported to Oblivion. Quite a harsh place to *want* to go, if that was their plan. It is possible they went somewhere by accident. It is even possible they just ceased to exist at all. The idea that they are lost in time is quite new to me. I highly doubt that since the laws behind time would govern us to not even recall they even existed. something supernatural, indeed. I *DO* know what happened, but in all reality, I do NOT know where they have gone or is they are in all truth, dead.\nPerhaps, with the meeting of our minds and studies, we can find more meaning and resolve to these matters at hand. I have dedicated much of my time and work to this subject and expect to find some sense in it.\nAnd beware the Tribunal. For years, they have known what we do not. They speak in odd Tongues and bite like snakes in tall wickwheat. Their secret is their true Power. For, the return of the Nerevarine Prophecy will bring them into the light and their true identities shall be known. Their words should be taken with a grain of skooma.\nDivayth Fyr the Psijic: 2002-09-20.\nAh, B, my good friend, you overestimate my intentions. I am but a student. A student of the mysteries that engulf the land entire. It is not my way to tackle obstacles. It is my way to solve them. One may know how to climb a mountain, yet one may never climb it. I do not seek the Power of the Heart. I yearn to understand it. Just as the Dwemer may have. We do not know for sure that they wished to such power. Perhaps they simply wished to understand it's uses. Not necessarily use them. One can only speculate.\nI had the opportunity of gaining audience with Sotha Sil some time ago. Indeed, it was long ago. He has since then gone into complete seclusion. He had little to say but would listen with an ever alert sense. I tried to persuade him into working with me on some theories involving the fluxuation of power that the Dwemer seemed to have mastered in their steam driven machina. Although he appeared quite interested, he was pressed for another duty. One which he did not, and would not mention. I bid him farewell and took my leave. He was nil seen after that meeting. I do agree, that Sotha Sil shares an interest as I do, but we are very much different. As I wish to understand, he wishes to utilise. He is the farthest thing from Psijic. I believe Sotha Sil cared not for Psijic Ways. There is order in the Ways, and Sotha Sil tends to follow only HIS order.\nIn the past, it would appear that the Tribunal have lost much communication with one another. With the reversing of Sotha Sil's Clockwork and his silence and seclusion, Vivec straining all power to hold aloft the mighty Blight, and Mournhold on the horizon of becoming a major Capital, the Man-Gods have their hands full. And with the Nerevarine Prophecy knocking on their doors, I would imagine there is nil cheer, but fear, in their hearts. What does the Prophecy have in store for them.\nDivayth Fyr the Psijic: 2002-09-24.\nVery interesting theories indeed, Raptor. Quite a bit of insight for a young up-and-coming scholar. Surely, the word \"betrayal\" rings out far and wide in this Tribunal circle. It is my belief, that there is a conspiracy that is still hidden in the depths of the Tribunal . Azura surely knows of it. Nerevar would too. I cannot say for sure if Nerevar betrayed Dagoth Ur, but we know that Dagoth is one that cannot be trusted, by writings. The Dissident Priests believe tell that Dagoth had a plan of his own.\nThe Raised King &lt;a href=\"Wulfarth\"&gt;Wulfarth&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"Nords\"&gt;Nords&lt;/a&gt;, and the &lt;a href=\"Orcs\"&gt;Orcs&lt;/a&gt; all played parts in this enormous plot. With all these players in their prospective positions, none may know of the Dwemer disappearance though. To know the answer to this mystery, one must understand the Powers that the heart held, Kagrenac's Tools, and Kagrenac's Plans. With an understanding of these issues, one may be able to unlock the demise of the Dwemer. Even speaking with Yagrum, he cannot be sure of what exactly happened and what the plans for the tools were. As of where my research currently stands, the only excuse for Yagrum's existence is the fact that he contracted Corprus, possibly rendering him immune to the disappearance. This, however, has a major loophole. Corprus and the Blight did not appear until AFTER the disappearance of the Dwemer. Is it possible that Corprus existed before? There is no record of it in all of Tamrielic history prior to the event. Much more is still hidden that we have yet to see, I am afraid. The Dwemer may still play a part in Tamrielic history I imagine. I do not think we have seen the end of them yet. Are they buying time in an out of reach location? It would appear that they left behind Centurions and Sentrys to keep guard of their strongholds. Did the Dwemer REALLY lose at Red Mountain? Perhaps that is what they wish us to think.\nWhat is true?\nWhat is false?\nWho is right?\nWho is wrong?\nSurely, all of our words are false, and we are all wrong? The Tribunal would make it so.\nDivayth Fyr the Psijic: 2002-09-25.\nMy dear lad, Striker... you appear to write as though I take all truth from scriptures and words. Alas, that is quite the contrary. Allow me to build on what I was attempting to say.\nThere is no solid proof that the Dwemer ever even HAD a \"link\" to the Heart. All we know is, they had the Heart in their possession and somehow, upon striking the Heart with the tools, they disappeared. I can so no more of this considering it is all that is known. As for the Tribunal, considering the Heart is their Power source, who knows just how their Powers would react to a severed link. Would they lose them? The only sure fire way of knowing would be in attempting such a feat.\nMy love for the Tribunal is no more than for a stranger passing on the road. It is quite passive, entering with little trust until proven. The Dissident Priests are a shady lot, yet they are true to the Ashlander belief, and stern believers in Nerevar. Now you, as an individual, neither of the Priests nor the Tribunal, must ask yourself, are the three \"False Gods\". In the context that the Dissident Priests paint, possibly so. In \"MY\" context, they are. Had they ascended by another means, suitable to comfort the Gods, I do believe they would be True enough Gods. However, they are no REAL Gods. What IS a REAL one would believe Azura a REAL God [Goddess] if one were inclined to believe in her. Without the ramblings of an old Dunmer who must get back to his studies sometime today, I personally consider them \"Powerful Dunmer\". No more, no less. Mind you, these are MY words. They are real enough to bleed and they walk with fellow Dunmer. In the sense of \"Gods\", they do not fit the description.\nSurely you must be mistaken if you think I believe what I read in scriptures and myths. I simply bring up The Five Songs of King Wulfarth for those who hunger for some insight to the Red Mountain situation of past. They are to be taken, my no means, as truth. Just as I, should be not taken for truth. They are quite , because there is no proof. They certainly contain many holes which only lead to more puzzlement, and that is where the reading gets interesting. So, certainly, the writing can be used, simply because, that is all we have, and to draw questions from that is the only way to put the true puzzle together. As many of my fellow scholars know, I know quite a bit of what happened through my researches and studies. However, I am sworn to my secrecy outside of my council.\nA trip to would be quite a step towards your researches. I have done so on many occasion. Such a wonderous city and named for the ever beautiful and deadly member of the Tribunal. Her audience will not be so easily accomplished though it would be a step in the right direction. Good luck in your ventures.\nDivayth Fyr the Psijic: 2002-09-26.\nI shall attempt to follow suit with as many questions as I can in my pressing time. For, I am due for a great feast with the council in short due time.\nAll very good assumptions and theories from this gathering. Quite intuitive. But, if you will allow me to add a small trinket of that has been completely overlooked, then I shall. If you have heard recently, the reincarnate, Lord Nerevar, did indeed confront the Heart, and it's loyal servant, Dagoth Ur. Nerevar had these great tools of Kagrenac, did he not? Think now, did he use just any ONE tool? Was there a particular way he had to use them? Think about these and I shall check with this gathering after my council feast.\nDivayth Fyr the Psijic: 2002-09-26.\nAllow me to what i was building on earlier.\nThe tools that the \"reincarnate\" of Nerevar used on the Heart (a correction in identity of this lone hero) were as follows...\nKeening\nSunder\nThe very same tools that Kagrenac built to tap into the Hearts power, and the same tools the Tribunal used to gain their \"Power\".\nThese tools may have to be used in some sort of combination. I have have heard tell of the combination that the \"reincarnate\" used, but have yet to speak with this \"Hortator\" that defeated Dagoth Ur. Perhaps the combination was NOT known by Kagrenac upon his tools upon the Heart, there was some that he did not expect, thus, causing the disappearance. Sotha Sil may have learned of the enchantments on the tools and deciphered the combination, allowing the Tribunal to correctly use the tools. Is it possible that Kagrenac did NOT know this combination that the Tribunal and the \"reincarnate\" used? Maybe there was another combination that Kagrenac used that Sotha Sil did not find. Speculation is all. I plan to meet with this \"Hortator\" and question him of his use of the tools. This may aid me in my understanding of the tools and perhaps, gain some more clues as to the Dwemer disappearance. If any of my fellow here has any information on the use or combination of these tools, feel free to share your . It may give us some deeper insight.\nDivayth Fyr the Psijic: 2002-09-30.\nThe Tribunal always respected my work and research to the point of tolerance. They do not always agree with my purpose and opinions, but they also realise my contributions. I do not wish to stand about and wave a flag in my honor, but I have been around for some time and have become one of the more \"powerful\" and \"\" mortals of this plane. I *DO* house a Dwemer and Yagrum is not a trophy. Vivec and the other Tribunal members may or may not know of his , this I do not know, but I also do not keep him secret from the Tribunal. If Vivec were to ask, I surely would inform him. I would not release Yagrum to Vivec's hold without a very good reason, of which I am sure the Tribunal could not consider one worthy enough. I hold no enchantments Yagrum from being seen as I am not his protector. Yagrum is a friend and his host. I work closely with him and we research many articles together. For, in Yagrum's prime, he was quite a himself. Corprus has taken quite a lot out of him and controlling the madness has become much of his internal battle. His memory and wisdom have failed him much since his people's disappearance and Corprus. Perhaps, if the Tribunal know this, they realise there is little threat from him. I recognise the Tribunal and offer much advice and play role as advisor on many an occasion, although I remain one of their largest skeptics. It is an built on respect more-so than friendship.\nAlso, do remember, with the coming of the named \"Hortator\" and reincarnate, the defeat of the Heart has altered the Tribunal. Still powerful, yet, I am quite sure much of their power has left them when the Heart took it's absence. just what they are capable of at this point is quite beyond my .\nDivayth Fyr the Psijic: 2002-09-30.\nMy Heart!? Surely my friend, you flatter me, however, my Heart would merely bring one a wet, blood-laden hand. My is quite mortal. My flesh is of the earth. My magics are of the mind. My mind is within the winds whence life leaves my body. Any material form of me will be quite useless when I am \"returned\". The most I have to offer the Tribunal will come in my living years. This they know, and this they follow by. To slaughter me for power would be quite a senseless act with nothing to gain. I will admit, numerous writs have come down bearing my namesake, and no Tong taking the challenge has ever left my Tower with his skin. Within my Halls, I live by the Law of Fyr. Many would believe that taking claim to my possessions will make them mighty indeed, but that is simply their fear of the mystery that surrounds me. I am quite mortal. Power gained was power earned. But mine, is most assuredly, power of .\nDivayth Fyr the Psijic: 2002-10-01.\nI am not, Divayth Fyr.\nThe words of many who I allow court. What exactly defines the \"proper\" Divayth Fyr?\nHe is not Divayth Fyr, and Divayth Fyr simply is not he.\n\"He\" is not the man, but he asked you, \"Who was he?\"\nI am, Divayth Fyr.\nHad I better relations with the Tong, a lawful writ might be sought out. And do know this... the words of the \"one\", Divayth Fyr, are never to be taken as, what you prefer to as, \"official\". Being but a scholar and student/teacher of lore, to be something of \"official\" is furthest from truth. Had my words been \"official\", I would hardly take audience with students, such as yourself. So I ask this of you, the one called bigdog60960, show respect until the respect is spent and absorbed by ignorance. Whence I lose your respect, your accounts shall press my shadow towards the sun until it is no more.\nI am, Divayth Fyr. of the Old. Scholar of the New.\nDivayth Fyr the Psijic: 2002-10-01.\nGood day to you and may you enjoy your travels in Morrowind. Let not my words offend you.\nDivayth Fyr the Psijic: 2002-10-02.\nI spoke with the Elders of the council, and a debate broke out concerning the public release of the Dwemer language. I shall continue on with my persuasion and will eventually win, but please remain patient. I am quite sure such a release will aid the lot of you in your researches.\nIt is, however, quite a risk on my behalf. The Tribunal may not appreciate my sharing of such a thing. I could not tell you why, but it is a .\nDivayth Fyr the Psijic: 2002-10-03.\nI have news on the council hearings regarding the Dwemer . The council seems all too afraid of the Tribunal at this point. The recent events surrounding Vvardenfell have everyone looking for answers and keeping tight on their observations. The council is more concerned with understanding this \"outlander\" than releasing any sort of documentation. BUT, what was discussed was a missing volume of a Dwemer translation of a popular book. This translation's whereabouts are unknown but it is possible that it is in this province. It has long been sought after by members of the council and lore masters alike, but no recovery has been claimed. I too shall begin a search for it and relay any clues as to it's location as I come across them. This indeed, be a wonderful find and quite a prize.\nDivayth Fyr the Psijic: 2002-10-10.\nOperation of the Dwemer constructs too hard to figure out actually. Yagrum here builds them out of pure fun, and many folk across the continent with the mechanical know-how have even succeeded at building these creations. Given they have the correct materials, they are quite simple. An old theory that they used a combination of steam power and magicka was questioned when a fellow in southern Morrowind built one successfully without an understanding of the magical arts. The Dwemer used a power source of which is long lost to our and you can still find a many of these power containers around. They go for a pretty drake. As for the fellow in the south, he was able to concoct a power source out of various ingredients, including an elixir, from which he would not reveal the specifics. I imagine it came from an illegal market and was not cheap in the slightest bit. His creations resemble the Dwemer constructs given he uses spare parts from them. He is quite an open fellow regarding them, and seeks to market them in some manner. Now, these being powered by a fluid source, can only mean that they will cease to operate once the drain this fuel or power. Clearly, not what the Dwemer used.\nNow, my idea for the Dwemer power source would still lean towards a combination of magicka and steam. Not all magicka was ignored by the Dwemer. It was simply not a widely used and taught art. If there were some way of knowing what exactly was in the containers that still lie about, I might be able to decipher such a thing and solve this riddle. Quite simply though, it is unlikely. Yagrum would know, but alas, he has lost much of his sanity and mind to the sickness. Perhaps one day, it will come back to him.\nYagrum Bagarn: 2002-10-11.\nIt makes me happy to see that so many are devoted to unlocking the truth of the Dwemer! I was quite intrigued to pay a visit to this gathering of minds once Master Fyr informed me of such an event. I have read through the gathered notes in hopes that something would possiblt spark a glint of my long lost knowlege. Some seems quite possible, but none can bring forth my past memory.\nI can, however, delve on the topic of the constructs. Given I have the right parts, I can create and repair several different variations. Master Fyr thinks it may aid me in my sickness to keep my mind on something that I know and appreciate doing. The idea of these canisters powering the constructs is quite true. The contents of the canisters still blanks in my mind however. How I long to remember! Powering my personal constructs, Master Fyr has concocted a fluid to fill the canisters. The fluid may only last up to a few days, depending on the construct and their consumption. I am quite sure this is not what these canisters held at one time though. The idea of spirits of the Dwemer filling these canisters is somewhat . That rings out necromancy of sorts and we Dwemer were all too uncaring for that art. I also find it difficult believing that this Heart could power such devices. It is not impossible, but I do not think Kagrenac's Plan involved the constructs, given the Dwemer had constructs long before the Heart was taken in.\nThere must be a fuel source, given the use of steam, perhaps accompanied by some sort of lasting enchantment. For the life of me, if I could only recall! It would be ever so helpful knowing. I would no longer have to have Uupse refilling my machina centurion chair.\nI shall return again to see how this progresses. I must return to my quarters to have some of my sores tended to. This blasted sickness is for the Daedra!\nDivayth Fyr the Psijic: 2002-10-17.\nMy studies and researches have delved even deeper into the disappearance. I believe I have come up with some staggering evidence that proves many of our theories wrong. Thinking more about the ghostly Dwemer spectres that still walk this plane, and constructs that remain operable after all these years, I have opened myself to more possibilities. Many of which are quite grand and may be conclusive. In proving my , I shall have to take council with the prophesized Nerevarine and research the Tools of Kagrenac even further. I believe that Sotha Sil may hold the secret to their disappearance since he was able to study the Tools. If I were to pry into them, I may be able to unlock what I believe to be the \"Truth\". This may be the very reason why Sotha Sil has chosen isolation. What he knows may present a great danger. Of course, getting answers from the Heart is quite impossible at this point, since it is believed that the Nerevarine has sent it to an outer plane, or perhaps destroyed it altogether.\nMy theory has been relayed to the council, where they are in total agreement that this should be looked into deeper.\nMy friends, these are rich times we are living! The truth is just around the corner.\nSotha Sil: 2002-10-18.\nI have in my possession, the Tools of Kagrenac. My Tower has been teleported to the Outer Planes so I may be quite secluded and without . So far, my findings are quite . The enchantments surrounding these devices are quite simple and easily conjured. I do not believe the enchantments alone to be the key I am looking for. It appears that any mortal man can such devices, given he knows the order of use.\nThere is something very peculiar here. I just can not put my finger on it. Under all the enchantments, they simply appear to be Dwemer devices of ornate design. Nothing new as a matter of fact. There must be more behind this. Perhaps the Heart played an even larger part than I have imagined. Kagrenac was quite the genius with invention and ambition, but the Tools just do not match up with many theories. How could these simple, enchanted Tools be used against the Heart and vanish an entire race? I am afraid there is more than meets the eye.\nSotha Sil: 2002-10-19.\nFriend Divayth, it is too long since we have spoken. And it is too often recently I have seen your words.\nYou toy with the minds of these curious mortals. The Tools of Kagrenac in your possession? I think not. Were you to have them, I would fear for your life. They are not tools for mortals, Fyr, as you well know.\nAnd what of your own mortality? How does that stand? If you live longer than a god, are you any less sublime? There has always been something different in you, though, I think. I believe you find a certain joy in your own mortality, thin stretched though it may be. It is a good quality in you.\nYour curiosity is troublesome. You are a wizard, a scholar, a delver into pasts and futures. This I understand, as I have been all these things and more.\nCuriosity is an odd thing. It is a bright path surrounded by brambles.\nYou are an interesting creature, my friend, and I would not wish you ill. I implore you take greater care with your words. The mortal mind is easily fractured by the divine.\nFor now, I will watch you entertain yourself as you toy with so much talk of the How and the Where. These are the questions most easily answered, but they will be the least satisfying.\nYagrum Bagarn: 2002-10-23.\nI do not feel that it was Master Sil's intention to harm Master Fyr (fear). My belief is that he indeed wished only to remind Master Fyr of the dangers involved in such research, given that Master Sotha knows a considerable amount more of these Tools and the Heart. Although Master Fyr journeyed to the Outer Realms, it is unlikely that the Heart has also ventured there. I do not think Master Sotha stubborn enough to attempt such a folly act as to these Tools upon the Heart even if it were there. Remember, he is a gatherer of information, not a pioneer to physical discovery.\nIn my heart and soul, I know Master Fyr to be quite unscathed and well being. He is far too wise to try anything absurd or to even be harmed by petty obstacles in the way of his research. Azura forbid something comes in the way of Master Divayth's work. May Dagon have mercy on your lost soul.\nI shall keep you all posted of Master Divayth's disappearance. Worry not though, for he is more of a man than any mortal can wish to be.\nYagrum Bagarn: 2002-10-25.\nAH, please, do excuse my wording. I still recall little of the Dwemer ways. I can only take Master Fyr's word for most of the Dwemer culture. This blasted corprus has drained me of much of my physical and my mental abilities. Memory is but a distant realisation for me.\nAs in speaking of Azura, my memory of my beliefs fails me. I have adopted many of Master Divayth's thoughts and theories over time. I do not worship the Daedra, but I do recognise them. Master Divayth's worship in the Daedra is quite unclear to me. I do not believe him to worship them but he realises their uses. On many occasion, Master Divayth may summon forth a Dremora Lord to to his bidding. Many times as his watch dogs or even protection. I have personally never been witness to Azura's presence, but Master Divayth assures me she is indeed existent. I can only take his word for it.\nI only wish Master Divayth were here to better cover this subject. I am but a sickly Dwemer with a failing mind.\nYagrum Bagarn: 2002-10-28.\nMaster Divayth has returned!\nUupse informed me that he had strangely appeared sometime overnight and that he spoke nil a word before locking himself into his study. He appears quite weary from his journey she says and a strange paleness has stricken his skin. I do hope Master Fyr is well. I wish to speak with him soon, given he will take audience. I am quite happy that he has returned, but concern for him and wonderment fill me with fear.\nWhy did he take refuge in his study?\nWhat could he have witnessed that drove him into his current state?\nWhen and will he be ready to join us with his discovery?\nDivayth Fyr the Psijic: 2002-11-04.\nFriends and collegues,\nThis is indeed a time of troubles. My recent discoveries have me pinned in a state of confusion. My dear friend Yagrum tells me he has told you of my journey. Though, I instructed him not to speak of my exploration, my extended stay left him quite alarmed, and he thought best to take council with you in search for help. Needless to say, I did find myself in a position to where I was to return for some time, and any help in returning would have been appreciated. I appreciate Yagrum's disobedience and his care for me has been noted immensely.\nI have been in deep thought and meditation for many days now. My comprehension of what I had witnessed is still quite out of reach. I do not know if I was witness to was a vision or reality. Paranoia and fear have stricken me and my meditations are still flooded with mind bending dreams. Or are they reality? Am I going mad?\nI have been called forth to appear in front of the council for my \"unlawful\" research into the outer plane. Though, I am quite the rogue, according to the council, they still wish to maintain a balance in the magicka and research tiers. I understand their motives and attempt to comply whenever possible. This, many already know however. I am a member of the council, but not a loyal subject by their Laws and Ways.\nUntil I brief the council, I shall share my vision, as I believe it only to have been...\nI was born unto the timeless land.\nWitness to blood of past.\nTime stood, towers still strong and new.\nAlone I stood, of flesh and eye.\nBut, not alone. For my brothers too, stood.\nI am merely a ghost, but the hate is still deep.\nThe Heart. The timeless shell. The living gear.\nTheir guardian? Their home? Their slave? Their tomb?\nOne holds the key. He will not tell. He can not tell.\nBegone. For they have only just been born. The time is coming.\nYou shall be witness. Time is aligning with time.\nThe truth is known. The blood shall run again.\nThis vision is all I am willing to share at this point. What it means holds more meaning than imaginable, and I hold much fear. These words haunt my thoughts endlessly. What I actually witnessed with my eyes haunts my very soul. Please, bear with me and in time, this shall all be brought into more light.\nI have been to the outer plane many times... I do not recall this...\nDivayth Fyr the Psijic: 2002-11-07.\nI have made sense of the vision. It WAS a vision . During my travels to other planes, I meditate to pass the time. Travel between planes is quite disorienting and one who is not used to the action may succumb to a sensation of his body being ripped apart. Meditation eases the sensation. My journey back took longer than usual. The \"vision\", or what could also be considered a nightmare, strayed me from my original path. I was unable to abandon the vision as it held me physically and mentally. Once the vision had ceased, I found myself lying nude, in some brush just outside of Tel Vos. Weakened from this extraordinary incident, I was able to still find my way back to my stronghold, where I slept for days, to regain my strength.\nIn speaking with the council on the matter, they too believe it to be a mere vision. Not one that holds any meaning, but perhaps merely a sign that I have been straining myself too hard on the matter of the Dwemer. This is very possible, although it seems a bit more to me. Rest is indeed what I lack, and I believe I shall take leave of such journeys for some time to regain my self being.\nYagrum, on the other hand, seems to have regained much in the past. He still shows signs of corprus, but his memory seems to slowly be coming back from time to time. He spends quite a bit of time on his own now and wishes to remain alone. I am sure that glimpses of his past, coming freshly back to him, give him much to ponder over. I feel for my old friend. I only wish there was more I could do. A temper seems to rattle him every now and then and I have instructed my sister-wives to leave him be. In time, he will come to and understand what fate holds for him.\nAnd interesting thing... Yagrum confronted me after my arrival from the council, and wished to know if I still had the Tools in my possession. Upon hearing that the Hortator had taken leave and carried the items off with him, Yagrum seemed quite upset. What is going in that mind of my old friend's. I shall keep a close eye on him, for I worry about his well being.\nDivayth Fyr the Psijic: 2002-11-08.\nConsidering the Tools and the outer Planes, nothing was accomplished. Bearing many of Kagrenac's journals and the correct materials, I was able to build exact replicas that worked exactly like the originals. The Tools are not the key whatsoever. This leads me to believe that the Heart was the major ingredient in this case. No doubt, the Tools acted as a sort of \"tuning fork and dial\" for the Heart. But tuning to what and dialing to what?\nMy thoughts carry more on the idea of whether the Heart was actually living. Or does Lorkhan speak through this heart? Or, is it simply a powerful gem of sorts? Is the Power simply leeched? Is a deal struck with the \"mind\" of the Heart for the Power? Does the owner (Lorkhan) of the heart grant the Power? Is it possible that the Tools are simply used to \"awaken\" the Heart?\nAlas, I must rest once again.\nDivayth Fyr the Psijic: Unknown date.\nJust a note on Sotha Sil my friends...\nThat was not the entire City. No indeed. It was Master Sil's main hall within his hidden city of Clockwork madness. Just as, outside of the pearly gates in Mournhold, exists a crawling area of numerous homes, citizens, and vendors. Sotha Sil is quite expanse and houses many more inhabitants. I have seen them in person, and my, what a sight! In the case of the Nerevarine, I hear tale that when he was teleported in by Almalexia, the machina lift door behind him was caved in. For whatever reason (did Almalexia do it or did Sotha Sil?), this barred him from venturing further. Where the Nerevarine actually was, is Sotha Sil's workshop/lair.\nThink about it though... if this were a city, who could possibly call this place home? More intelligent fabricant type inventions? I dare not tell, although I have seen it with mine own eyes. Perhaps one day, the location will be openly known, and visitors can venture forth into the Clockwork City entire.\nDivayth Fyr the Psijic: Unknown date.\nAlas!\n\"This is the truth of Sermon Zero, which is neither one.\"\nFrom these \"so called\" hidden messages, which I applaud you on, do you see truth? The first line, through strange misconception, leads one to believe that this message can be taken as false word also. Much of what I already know is quite alarming, and the truth is just around the corner from all unknowing citizens of the Empire. I do hope, for the sake of Tamriel, that we are prepared for any upcoming revelations or long tucked away truths. If the \"ghost\" is indeed walking among us, the times we are all witnessing, may be in for quite a shock.\nDivayth Fyr the Psijic: Unknown date.\nBump indeed! My studies and research has had me so preoccupied recently that I have been careless about these discussions. The Psijic Endeavor. Why, were I not a Psijic myself, I may have had the time to discuss this subject more promptly.\nMan becoming Godly? Perhaps a mere shadow of a God is more appropriate? And to \"surpass\" a God, well, now we are speaking of a grand gift. One really must be thoughtful of the \"Gods\" before one can even imagine gaining such a high power/command. Who and what are the Gods? Are they true beings of power? Are they merely Man with incredible ability? Are they figments of our frightened imaginations; something that comforts us in our time of loss and fright? IF, indeed, these \"Gods\" are beings that scripture and ink bring us to believe, then any Man could fathom the idea of being One.\nThis brings up many other interesting revelations. The Dwemer apparently had the Gods on the virge of fear with their new and amazing power (thus, the term, \"technology\" could be used). Did the Dwemer seek out such Godly power and attempt to achieve a sort of Nirvana? Not much different than the Psijic Endeavor one would imagine, BUT, were the Dwemer Psijics, or of the sort? Did they get close enough to frighten even the Gods, and find a heavy punishment awaiting? The Heart of Lorkhan was, by Legend, cast into Vvardenfell, creating Red Mountain. The Dwemer were native to this region, and had they uncovered this Heart, it seems likely that they would have the ability to gain something from it. Why else would Lorkhan and Dagoth Ur storm the Mountain? Surely, Lorkhan would dearly love to retrieve his Heart, but Dagoth Ur was also intent on the unknown power of the Heart. The Dwemer were merely an obstacle, no? Expendable. Dagoth Ur had no love for the Dwemer. Surely, the Endeavor is an idea to all mortals, but is possible? One is led to believe that, had the Dwemer or Dagoth Ur succeeded in controlling this Heart, would it perhaps be The Key to opening the door? The Heart of a \"God\" in possession of a mortal. The idea is very exciting yet horrifying.\nAs a Psijic of the New Ways, the Dwemer appear to have been most successful in the Endeavor than any mortal. Their Endeavor is not the shared Endeavor of the Old Way. The New Way, so I speak with no REAL title, is the Way in which I have devoted my research to. I find this New Way to be most delightful a study. The Dwemer have taught me more about the \"ideals\" of the Endeavor than any Psijic could have in 1,000 years. So many questions, so little time.

Sotha Sil was the mightiest wizard and most wise counselor of the First Council. One of the original companions of Nerevar as well as the teacher of Nerevar and Vivec, he is the Light of Knowledge and the Inspiration of Craft and Sorcery. He lives in his Clockwork City with mechanical devices of his making, and is rarely seen in Morrowind. While Vivec and Almalexia have traditionally been fairly visible to their followers, the scholar Sotha Sil has been more reclusive. Little else is known about this reclusive god. Vivec has not heard from him since their defeat at Red Mountain, scarcely ever hearing from him before. Vivec notes that he is completely self-absorbed like himself, and doubts he will notice his divine powers diminish without the Heart, just as he barely notices others most of the time. He is fascinated by the hidden world and its mysteries, he lives in his own way, as he always has. King &lt;a href=\"Helseth\"&gt;Helseth&lt;/a&gt; says no one has seen the Tinkerer in centuries.\nIn &lt;a href=\"3E%20417\"&gt;3E 417&lt;/a&gt;, Sotha Sil, along with his fellow &lt;a href=\"Tribunal\"&gt;Tribunal&lt;/a&gt; Almalexia and &lt;a href=\"Vivec\"&gt;Vivec&lt;/a&gt;, traveled to &lt;a href=\"Red%20Mountain\"&gt;Red Mountain&lt;/a&gt; to enact their annual godhood ritual on the &lt;a href=\"Heart%20of%20Lorkhan\"&gt;Heart of Lorkhan&lt;/a&gt;; however, &lt;a href=\"Dagoth%20Ur%20%28Character%29\"&gt;Dagoth Ur&lt;/a&gt; and his &lt;a href=\"Ash%20Vampire\"&gt;Ash Vampire&lt;/a&gt;s attacked the Tribunal, stealing &lt;a href=\"Keening%20%28Morrowind%29\"&gt;Keening&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Sunder\"&gt;Sunder&lt;/a&gt; from them.\nSotha Sil later retired to his Clockwork City, and cut off what little interaction with the outside world he had left. When the &lt;a href=\"Nerevarine\"&gt;Nerevarine&lt;/a&gt; destroyed the heart in &lt;a href=\"3E%20427\"&gt;3E 427&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Vivec\"&gt;Vivec&lt;/a&gt; noted that he doubted Sotha Sil even noticed the loss of his godhood due to his obsession with his city.\nLater, Almalexia sent the Nerevarine to Clockwork City to kill Sotha Sil. However, Sotha Sil was already found dead, and Almalexia traveled to them revealing her true plan to have the Nerevarine killed by Clockwork City's defenses on their way to Sil, and that she killed Sotha Sil out of her insanity.\nInteractions.\n&lt;a href=\"The%20Mad%20God\"&gt;The Mad God&lt;/a&gt;.\nFollowing the release of the &lt;a href=\"Fabricant%20%28Tribunal%29\"&gt;Fabricants&lt;/a&gt; and other creatures on Mournhold, Almalexia sends you to kill Sotha Sil in Clockwork City, out of the belief he is behind the attack. After defeating his &lt;a href=\"Imperfect%20%28Tribunal%29\"&gt;Imperfect&lt;/a&gt; bodyguards, Sotha Sil can be found in his dome. However, after interacting with him, the following message appears:\n\"You have found the body of Sotha Sil, his lifeless husk dangling from a contraption of his own making. Someone has obviously been here before you.\"\nAfter walking back to the entrance, Almalexia will appear, informing you of her true plans. She will say that she wanted the Nerevarine to become a martyr in her name, who died trying to defeat the mad god Sotha Sil. She reveals that she was the one who killed Sotha Sil, and needs to kill you in order to keep her dark plan a secret."}

Clever.\"\n\"Manipulative,\" the Scribe said distastefully.\nSotha Sil spread his arms. He had chosen to portray them both as flesh this time. \"Is that not the role of the Scribe?\"\n\"I wanted them to know you as I do, but the words wouldn't come. I had to pass the task on to another.\"\n\"You mean you trusted another with a task so dear to your heart that you could not put quill to parchment.\" Seht's tone bore a rare hint of playful amusement. \"That is no bad thing for people like us.\"\nThe Scribe shook his head. \"I was afraid of being wrong.\"\n\"No, you were afraid of being imperfect.\" Sotha Sil conjured an old tome and flipped through the pages. \"You always are. Do you really love them so much?\"\nThe Scribe stood slowly, turning to gaze at a map of Nirn pinned to the wall of his chambers. \"No,\" he spoke the truth quietly. \"But I love her. And she belongs to them.\"\n\"If it helps, the words I spoke were true.\"\n\"I know,\" said the Scribe. \"I have read them many times.\"\n\"You like them,\" said Seht.\n\"I do.\"\nSotha Sil made a chair for himself and sat. The Scribe turned to his friend, his mentor, his child shared with many fathers. \"Did you come to say goodbye, Seht?\"\n\"In a way,\" Seht replied, and there was no sadness in his voice. \"Perhaps another form will appear that looks much like me and plays the role he is needed to play in yet another tale. I will be gone by then.\"\nThe Scribe nodded as he returned to his chair. He looked across the writing desk at Sotha Sil's face and Seht's eyes.\n\"Will what we tried to do be enough?\" The Scribe saw understanding as he spoke. The Light of Knowledge could give courage to Prisoners, but never to the Scribe.\n\"This world cannot know peace,\" said Sotha Sil the God. \"Just as its caretakers cannot. It will never be enough, but we persevere for the beauty of dawn in spite of long nights.\"\nIt was Seht that leaned forward then. \"Every parent believes they have not done enough.\"\nThe Scribe reflected then on his many regrets, but spoke only one. \"I tried to save you,\" he said. \"To give some weight to the myths. But I cannot stop what is.\"\n\"You chose not to because you love me.\" Once again, the words of a god rang true.\n\"You are the Father of Mysteries,\" said the Scribe.\n\"And I must leave, whether I wish to or not,\" said Seht. \"If only so Sotha Sil can remain.\"\nThe Scribe nodded again. \"Will you leave any instruction for us?\"\nThe Clockwork God pursed his lips, then spoke. \"Beware the leap to certainty. The Named Daedra have many aspects. Many faces. Do not let one aspect overpower another, for they are agents of chaos. To let their nature calcify will lead to complacency and ruin. This era of strife cannot end until you scatter the lie of their simplicity.\"\nThe Scribe bowed his head in silent assent, then opened his eyes again. \"And you, Seht?\"\n\"I saw the imperfections in everything I ever attempted,\" said Seht, glancing at the map of Nirn. \"Even imperfections in my pursuit to rid myself of them. Yet I could never stop tinkering. I could never stop creating. I loved her too much. I will give no instruction to you who have already come to know love.\"\nSotha Sil's body dematerialized into a thousand tiny lights. They danced around the room, illuminating books, and scrolls, and maps with a divine golden glow. It was Seht that spoke the last.\n\"I leave it to you.\"\nA heady silence settled in the Scribe's chamber\u2014filling the dimly-lit room with renewed and solemn purpose. At length, the Scribe's mouth turned to a smile, and once again he took up his quill."}

It is a place devoid of (faunal) life\u2014the only beings that exist there are souls, undead, and the rulers of the realm, the &lt;a href=\"Ideal%20Masters\"&gt;Ideal Masters&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe Ideal Masters are enigmatic entities that lord over the Soul Cairn, controlling every aspect of its being. It is believed that the Soul Cairn exists so that the Ideal Masters can collect souls and feed on them; some hypotheses even suggest they use the souls as a form of currency to an even higher power.\nThe Soul Cairn is also home to powerful undead beings, which are highly sought after by necromancers. Souls are sent to the Soul Cairn by necromancers who wish to summon these undead, but in order to do so they must travel to the realm in person to finalize the deal with the Ideal Masters. They are often tricked, and many become trapped as harvested souls.\nGeography.\nThe landscape of the Soul Cairn is barren and dry, with only dead trees and bushes scattered throughout the realm, as well as plant-like growths known as &lt;a href=\"Soul%20Husk\"&gt;Soul Husk&lt;/a&gt;s.\nThe sky is perpetually bleak and cloudy, and lightning strikes constantly throughout the realm. There is no sun in the sky, but instead a single moon and a huge black circular void.\nNumerous buildings and altars can be found throughout the land, alongside mysterious upright stones and circular crystalline structures. The crystal circles will replenish the health of any being that stands in them, although they will quickly dim and become inert after use. In the tallest towers, the uppermost sections are composed of blocks suspended in midair, rotating around the tower and emitting a purple light.\nThe realm is partitioned by an enormous fortified wall that divides the landscape, though it is unknown why. Magical barriers also block off certain areas.\nSoul Fissures.\nThere are numerous luminescent cracks in the ground throughout the Cairn. Interacting with one will fill the largest empty &lt;a href=\"Soul%20Gem%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;soul gem&lt;/a&gt; on hand, although soul fissures will not fill the &lt;a href=\"Black%20Star\"&gt;Black Star&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"Azura%27s%20Star%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Azura's Star&lt;/a&gt;.\nCrystalline structures.\nScattered across the Cairn are a number of floating purple crystals that resemble giant soul gems. Approaching these will drain the health of any living being that gets too close. Eating a Soul Husk or &lt;a href=\"Soul%20Husk%20Extract\"&gt;Soul Husk Extract&lt;/a&gt;, however, will counter the drain for a short time.\nLightning Attractor.\nThere are four lightning attractors located in the Soul Cairn. Activate these by using &lt;a href=\"Grand%20Soul%20Gem%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;grand soul gems&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"Greater%20Soul%20Gem%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;greater soul gems&lt;/a&gt;. Lightning will strike the rod, and &lt;a href=\"mistmen\"&gt;mistmen&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Boneman%20%28Dawnguard%29\"&gt;bonemen&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Wrathman%20%28Dawnguard%29\"&gt;wrathmen&lt;/a&gt; will appear. Also, the soul gem will be replaced by a black soul gem. After being struck, the rod will slide into the orifice and the lightning attractor cannot be activated a second time.\nLocked rooms.\nThere are rooms scattered about the Soul Cairn that have metal poles blocking their entrances. These can be unlocked by shooting both of the glowing blue orbs in the obelisks nearby with &lt;a href=\"shouts\"&gt;shouts&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Spells%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;spells&lt;/a&gt;, or &lt;a href=\"Arrows%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;arrows&lt;/a&gt;.\nSublocations.\nReaper's Lair.\nWhile inside the Soul Cairn, if the &lt;a href=\"Last%20Dragonborn\"&gt;Dragonborn&lt;/a&gt; turns right after going through the stone wall and follows the barrier, the Reaper's Lair will be found just past one of the large towers with floating blocks and swirling energies at the top (It is not the structure where there is a lantern on the ground in the alcove; rather the next building to the east of this one).\nInside lies the Reaper Shard Receptacle, which is activated by placing three &lt;a href=\"reaper%20gem%20fragment\"&gt;reaper gem fragment&lt;/a&gt;s in the receptacle. These fragments are located in chests beneath three of the giant floating soul gems which drain health. Lightning frequently strikes the center of the room. Putting three shards in the receptacle summons &lt;a href=\"Reaper%20%28Dawnguard%29\"&gt;The Reaper&lt;/a&gt;, who attacks. If one goes into no-clip while inside the lair, they may notice three rowboats side-by-side floating over nothing.\nNote: If one of the alternate methods to spawn the Reaper is used, it will not show if the three Reaper Gem Fragments are used (confirmed on PS3).\nBoneyard.\nThe Boneyard is accessible after killing the three keepers. &lt;a href=\"Valerica\"&gt;Valerica&lt;/a&gt; is trapped here along with one of the three &lt;a href=\"Elder%20Scroll%20%28Blood%29\"&gt;Elder Scrolls&lt;/a&gt;. Shortly after the Dragonborn enters the Boneyard, &lt;a href=\"Durnehviir\"&gt;Durnehviir&lt;/a&gt; will attack.\nQuests.\n&lt;a href=\"Beyond%20Death\"&gt;Beyond Death&lt;/a&gt;.\n&lt;a href=\"Serana\"&gt;Serana's&lt;/a&gt; mother, Valerica, is found here. She offers an Elder Scroll to the Dragonborn if the keepers located at the tallest spires in the Soul Cairn are defeated. She warns that a fearsome dragon named Durnehviir may take notice of the keepers' demise. Once all of the keepers have been killed, the wall that blocks access to the castle disappears. After entering the Boneyard, Durnehviir will appear and attempt to kill the Dragonborn. Defeat him and speak with Valerica, who will lead the Dragonborn to the Elder Scroll. After acquiring the Elder Scroll and exiting the Boneyard, Durnehviir will be found waiting on a broken structure. After conversing with him, he teaches the Dragonborn &lt;a href=\"Summon%20Durnehviir\"&gt;a shout&lt;/a&gt; to call him from the Soul Cairn.\n&lt;a href=\"Impatience%20of%20a%20Saint\"&gt;Impatience of a Saint&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe Dragonborn can interact with the soul of &lt;a href=\"Jiub%20%28Dawnguard%29\"&gt;Jiub&lt;/a&gt; in the northeast section of the Soul Cairn. Jiub explains that he wants to write the second volume of his opus, but he has lost the pages to his first volume and requires them to continue writing. There are ten pages in total, scattered across the barren landscape of the Soul Cairn.\n&lt;a href=\"Find%20Arvak%27s%20Skull\"&gt;Find Arvak's Skull&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe Dragonborn can also complete a side quest to free an undead skeletal horse named &lt;a href=\"Arvak\"&gt;Arvak&lt;/a&gt;. This mount can then be summoned at will in either &lt;a href=\"Nirn\"&gt;Nirn&lt;/a&gt; or the Soul Cairn. &lt;a href=\"Arvak%27s%20Skull\"&gt;Arvak's Skull&lt;/a&gt; can be found under a glowing pavilion near the big castle. Returning the Skull to its owner will reward the Dragonborn with the &lt;a href=\"Summon%20Arvak\"&gt;Summon Arvak&lt;/a&gt; spell.\nSoul Husk Hunt.\nThere is a &lt;a href=\"soul\"&gt;soul&lt;/a&gt;, named Morven Stroud, in the northern section, directly east of the dividing wall. Speak to him and he will ask for twenty-five soul husks in return for the opportunity to \"see his wares.\" For every twenty-five soul husks the Dragonborn brings to him, they receive the opportunity to trade for a random sword, battleaxe, light armor, heavy armor, or spell tome. This quest is repeatable as soul husks respawn. All of the items he has to offer are enchanted.\nA glowing pit portal to the right of Morven Stroud will teleport the Dragonborn to the top of a building. Look to the building with the obelisks with glowing orbs, there is a spot to jump down to get a hidden chest."}

Few wizards who have dared to research the subject more deeply often just disappear.\nProperties.\nAppearance.\nCommon categorization of black and white soul gems have little to do with their appearance. Usually the color of a soul gem is purple and creation of a black soul gem does not make it black, but darkens it significantly. Rarely exceptional soul gems can be found that are colored differently.\nAnother way to tell a soul gem apart from other precious gems is their crystalline form. Soul gems are rarely cut as they are not commonly used in jewelry. Moreover, changing the form of a soul gem will influence its mystic properties, suggesting that a successful attempt can only be performed by a skillful mage.\nLastly, soul gems can be found in various sizes, scaling from the size of a precious gem to a size of a fist.\nMystic.\nAs the name suggests, soul gems can be used to imprison souls. These imprisoned souls can be used as a power source for several magical activities and in bargains with various powerful entities.\nSoul gems can be found in different qualities. The most obvious indicator of the quality is the size of the gem, the bigger the better. Higher quality gems can be used to hold souls of stronger creatures. Quality of regular soul gems are categorized as &lt;a href=\"Petty%20Soul%20Gem\"&gt;petty&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Lesser%20Soul%20Gem\"&gt;lesser&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Common%20Soul%20Gem\"&gt;common&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Greater%20Soul%20Gem\"&gt;greater&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Grand%20Soul%20Gem\"&gt;grand&lt;/a&gt;, but rarely gems with even higher capacity can be found.\nThere are two known categories of souls: white and black.\u00a0White souls are had by lesser creatures of &lt;a href=\"Nirn\"&gt;Nirn&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Oblivion\"&gt;Oblivion&lt;/a&gt;. These can be held by natural soul gems. Souls of &lt;a href=\"men\"&gt;men&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"mer\"&gt;mer&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"beastfolk\"&gt;beastfolk&lt;/a&gt; are considered black. According to Arkay's Law their souls are protected by the &lt;a href=\"Arkay\"&gt;Arkay&lt;/a&gt; himself, but black soul gems can be used to bypass this protection and trap souls of sentient beings.\nThe act of imprisonment occurs using the &lt;a href=\"Soul%20Trap\"&gt;Soul Trap&lt;/a&gt; spell or a similar soul trap &lt;a href=\"Enchanting%20%28Skyrim%29%23Enchantments\"&gt;enchantment&lt;/a&gt;. Those few capable of using\u00a0&lt;a href=\"Thu%27um\"&gt;Thu'um&lt;/a&gt;\u00a0can also use a &lt;a href=\"Soul%20Tear%20%28Dawnguard%29\"&gt;Soul Tear&lt;/a&gt; shout to extract the soul and is raise the corpse from the dead.\u00a0However, the gem also behaves as a soul vacuum and an improperly filled gem will slowly drain casters soul into it.\nIt is known that the being trapped inside the gem remains fully aware and sentient.\u00a0But a sudden death may confuse the soul making it lose the sense of time and place.\nIn most cases, if a filled soul gem is damaged it will release the soul. The trapped being will not, however, regain its physical form. &lt;a href=\"Daedric%20Princes\"&gt;Daedric Princes&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Ideal%20Masters\"&gt;Ideal Masters&lt;/a&gt; are known to posses ability to extract and alter the souls trapped inside the gems. Only known sorcerer to be able to restore a gem trapped being is the &lt;a href=\"Sload\"&gt;Sload&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"necromancer\"&gt;necromancer&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"N%27Gasta\"&gt;N'Gasta&lt;/a&gt;.\nAcquisition.\nWhite soul gems occur naturally and can be found in underground deposits just as any other gem. One of the places rich with &lt;a href=\"Geode%20Vein\"&gt;soul gem geodes&lt;/a&gt; is a vast underground cavern in &lt;a href=\"Skyrim\"&gt;Skyrim&lt;/a&gt; named &lt;a href=\"Blackreach%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Blackreach&lt;/a&gt;.\nBlack Soul Gems.\nUnlike the white soul gems, black soul gems do not occur naturally and must be created using great or grand white soul gems. Little is known about what exactly happens during the alteration of the soul gem. At least two ways of creating a black soul gem are known.\nFirst and, likely, most common way of creating a black soul gem is by the &lt;a href=\"Shade%20of%20the%20Revenant\"&gt;Shade of the Revenant&lt;/a&gt;,\u00a0a necromantic ritual performed by the\u00a0&lt;a href=\"Order%20of%20the%20Black%20Worm\"&gt;Order of the Black Worm&lt;/a&gt;. The ritual can only be performed on certain dates and in certain locations. During the ritual grand soul gems are placed as offerings to the infamous &lt;a href=\"Altmer\"&gt;Altmer&lt;/a&gt; necromancer &lt;a href=\"Mannimarco\"&gt;Mannimarco&lt;/a&gt;, who is believed to darken the gems afterward.\nThe second way of creating a black soul gem is by going directly to the &lt;a href=\"Soul%20Cairn\"&gt;Soul Cairn&lt;/a&gt;, the realm of the Ideal Masters. &lt;a href=\"Lightning%20Attractor\"&gt;Lightning attractors&lt;/a&gt; found throughout the barren landscape can transform white soul gems into black soul gems when lightning strikes them. What makes this method particularly difficult is the fact that, in order to enter the Soul Cairn, a person must be undead or partially soul trapped.\nThe knowledge of creating a black soul gem has not always been had by the men, mer and beastfolk. The first known use of a black soul gem dates &lt;a href=\"2E%20864\"&gt;2E 864&lt;/a&gt;, when a &lt;a href=\"Redguard\"&gt;Redguard&lt;/a&gt; prince &lt;a href=\"A%27Tor\"&gt;A'Tor&lt;/a&gt; was trapped inside one.\nUtilization.\nSchools of Magic.\nIt is believed, that the art of Enchanting was first developed and prized by the lost &lt;a href=\"Ayleid\"&gt;Ayleid&lt;/a&gt;. Among the modern Tamrielic races, however, skill of binding a soul to a gem and the art of Enchantment was first developed by the witch &lt;a href=\"Raven%20Direnni\"&gt;Raven Direnni&lt;/a&gt; sometime in the early\u00a0&lt;a href=\"First%20Era\"&gt;First Era&lt;/a&gt;.\nSince then dealing with souls and their power has been a part of the school of &lt;a href=\"Mysticism\"&gt;Mysticism&lt;/a&gt;, that was developed by the &lt;a href=\"Psijic%20Order\"&gt;Psijic Order&lt;/a&gt;. Soul Trap used to be considered an apprentice level spell under the school of Mysticism. In the &lt;a href=\"Fourth%20Era\"&gt;Fourth Era&lt;/a&gt;, however, the spells and dealings with souls merged with the school of &lt;a href=\"Conjuration\"&gt;Conjuration&lt;/a&gt; as the school of Mysticism no longer existed.\nEnchanting.\nAmong modern races Enchanting was first only practiced by solitary mages.\u00a0Enchanting was first popularized by the famous &lt;a href=\"Vanus%20Galerion\"&gt;Vanus Galerion&lt;/a&gt;\u00a0in the &lt;a href=\"Second%20Era\"&gt;Second Era&lt;/a&gt;. The Archmagister also invented automatized enchanting tools, that could enchant items upon a request of any unskilled individual. In &lt;a href=\"Third%20Era\"&gt;Third&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Fourth%20Era\"&gt;Fourth Era&lt;/a&gt;s\u00a0Enchanting became, probably, the most known and universally accepted use of soul gems. The fine art was kept and studied at the &lt;a href=\"Arcane%20University%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;Arcane University&lt;/a&gt;. In &lt;a href=\"4E%20174\"&gt;4E 174&lt;/a&gt; during the sack of &lt;a href=\"Imperial%20City\"&gt;Imperial City&lt;/a&gt;, much of the established knowledge in the field was lost.\nEnchanting uses the mystic power of a soul to grant items magical properties. Most commonly enchantments are made to improve personal gear, such as armor, weapons or jewelery, but improvements of other items and tools, such as quills, is also possible.\nTo enchant an item it must be melded with a filled soul gem. Usually to accomplish this an &lt;a href=\"Altar%20of%20Enchanting\"&gt;Altar of Enchanting&lt;/a&gt; or an &lt;a href=\"Arcane%20Enchanter%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Arcane Enchanter&lt;/a&gt; is used. After enchanting the improved item becomes the new prison for the soul. An unwilling soul will often go mad, however the time a soul can keep its sanity is dependent on the strength of the soul and skill of the enchanter.\nThe magical abilities of an enchanted weapon will decay on use. Thus to regain the power of the weapon quickly it is often refueled by molding in another soul gem. Sometimes enchantment may recharge over time like a persons magicka would. It is theorized, that it is the destructive nature of the weapon, that depletes the soul, or, perhaps, soul is slowly absorbed by the victims.\nArmor and jewelery enchantments behave differently. Recharge of an enchanted armor is never necessary. It is once again theorized, that this is possible due to the wearer himself contributing small amounts of energy or just by the will of the &lt;a href=\"Magnus\"&gt;Magnus&lt;/a&gt; himself.\nConjuration.\nSchool of Conjuration includes summoning of creatures and other vital resources from &lt;a href=\"Oblivion%20%28Realm%29\"&gt;Oblivion&lt;/a&gt;. After the disbandment of the school of Mysticism in the Fourth Era, school of Conjuration has also taken over the Soul Trap spell.\nUnlike the Enchanting, that completely relies of the power of the soul gems, Conjuration spells and rituals can be performed independently without any additional power sources.\nSoul can be used as currency in bargains with the daedric creatures of the Outer Realms. Exotic alchemical ingredients, daedric gear and wide range of different daedric creatures can be summoned by exchanging soul gems at an &lt;a href=\"Atronach%20Forge\"&gt;Atronach Forge&lt;/a&gt; or an &lt;a href=\"Atronach%20Altar\"&gt;Atronach Altar&lt;/a&gt;.\nSoul gems and similar magical containers can be used as a remote power outlet to maintain portals between the Nirn and Oblivion.\nNecromancy.\nNecromancy is a sub-school of Conjuration, that deals precisely with capture and utilization of black souls. It is considered to be the origin school of black soul gems.\nAny creature captured in a black soul gem is thought to be eventually sent to the Soul Cairn. The lords of the realm, &lt;a href=\"Ideal%20Masters\"&gt;Ideal Masters&lt;/a&gt;, are often communicated and bargained with by many necromancers. In exchange of souls Ideal Masters often offer great rewards, but are known to trick their followers into slavery.\n&lt;a href=\"Soul%20gem%20shards\"&gt;Soul gem shards&lt;/a&gt; are also among the ingredients necessary to open a portal to the Soul Cairn.\nTechnology.\nSoul gems are known to be included into the complex\u00a0&lt;a href=\"Dwemer\"&gt;Dwemer&lt;/a&gt;\u00a0&lt;a href=\"animunculi\"&gt;animunculi&lt;/a&gt;. Although the purpose of the gems is unknown, amateur expeditions confirm, that the soul gem is not used as the main source of power. Several different hypotheses have been made including the soul gem being the source of heat for the boilers or the soul gem being the source of Destruction magic capable of shocking transgressors. Large quantities of soul gems have been found in the Dwemer Arcanex, small structures believed to house their research in magic.\nDwemer, however, are not the only lost race to use this form of power. Ayleid are known to have used different enchantments to protect their cities and outposts. Their enchantments were, however, not powered by regular soul gems, but &lt;a href=\"Welkynd%20Stone\"&gt;Welkynd&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Varla%20Stone\"&gt;Varla stones&lt;/a&gt;.\nSoul gems can also be found powering traps and defenses in ancient Nord burial grounds and now buried fortresses and cities.\nAn interesting and still applied use of soul gems is the growth of &lt;a href=\"House%20Telvanni\"&gt;House Telvanni&lt;/a&gt; towers and towns. Mages of Telvanni use soul gems to rapidly grow the &lt;a href=\"Morrowind\"&gt;Morrowind&lt;/a&gt; native &lt;a href=\"Emperor%20Parasol\"&gt;Emperor Parasol&lt;/a&gt; to gigantic proportions. This results in the unique and organic architecture that House Telvanni possess. Strangely enough, this appliance of soul gems also seem to grow the gems themselves.\nCulture.\nWorship.\nDue to the high value of souls to all magic-users, soul gems have gained a role of appropriate offerings in many traditional and religious practices.\nProbably the most powerful entities to value the souls of mortals are the Daedric Princes. Outside the magical bargains, Princes will often demand soul gem offerings from their worshipers. Combined with knowledge in magic, offerings to the Daedra may even cure the normally incurable &lt;a href=\"Vampirism%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Vampirism&lt;/a&gt;.\nMore traditional use of soul gems, that is not a direct offering, is seen in &lt;a href=\"Morrowind\"&gt;Morrowind&lt;/a&gt;, where it is customary for the &lt;a href=\"Pilgrimages%20of%20the%20Seven%20Graces\"&gt;Pilgrims of the Seven Graces&lt;/a&gt; to leave a soul gem in remembrance of their ancestors who were bound to the &lt;a href=\"Tribunal\"&gt;Tribunal's&lt;/a&gt; service.\nYet another cult to use soul gems as offerings is the previously mentioned Order of the Worm. During their ritual in which the soul gems are offered to the Mannimarco, they recognize their once mortal idol as a deity capable of hiding his worshipers from Arkay.\nPublic opinion.\nTrade and use of white soul gems is not an uncommon sight throughout the &lt;a href=\"Tamriel\"&gt;Tamriel&lt;/a&gt;. Schools of Enchanting and Conjuration are commonly practiced. Black soul gems, with its school of origin, Necromancy, however are universally looked down upon by the general public. Immorality and heretical nature of Necromancy has been known to mages since before the recorded history. Even the legendary\u00a0&lt;a href=\"Psijic%20Order\"&gt;Psijic Order&lt;/a&gt; had forbidden the use of Black Arts.\nIn the &lt;a href=\"Septim%20Empire\"&gt;Empire&lt;/a&gt; Necromancy was first forbidden by the founder of &lt;a href=\"Mages%20Guild\"&gt;Mages Guild&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Vanus%20Galerion\"&gt;Vanus Galerion&lt;/a&gt;. The law has been questioned and even ignored by many mages since, resulting in a heavier enforcement by the Arch Mage &lt;a href=\"Hannibal%20Traven%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;Hannibal Traven&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"3E%20433\"&gt;3E 433&lt;/a&gt;. Since then any Necromantic research had to be heavily monitored by the Mages Guild, and anyone who practice the school outside was considered an enemy of the guild, making him a target for the &lt;a href=\"Order%20of%20the%20Lamp\"&gt;Order of the Lamp&lt;/a&gt;.\nIn &lt;a href=\"Skyrim\"&gt;Skyrim&lt;/a&gt; the &lt;a href=\"College%20of%20Winterhold%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;College of Winterhold&lt;/a&gt; had allowed the Necromancy to some degree. Those, who ventured too far with their research were, however, expelled from the college.\nDespite the common belief in the Empire school of Necromancy is especially disliked in the ancestor-worshiping &lt;a href=\"Morrowind\"&gt;Morrowind&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href=\"House%20Telvanni\"&gt;House Telvanni&lt;/a&gt; allow necromancers to be among them, but only perform non-ritual spells with the souls of, in their opinion, lesser races - men, &lt;a href=\"Argonian\"&gt;Argonian&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Orsimer\"&gt;Orc&lt;/a&gt;.\nSee also.\nFor information about the soul gems in specific Elder Scrolls games, please see the following:"}

Those few capable of using\u00a0&lt;a href=\"Thu%27um\"&gt;Thu'um&lt;/a&gt;\u00a0can also use a &lt;a href=\"Soul%20Tear%20%28Dawnguard%29\"&gt;Soul Tear&lt;/a&gt; shout to extract the soul and is raise the corpse from the dead.\u00a0However, the gem also behaves as a soul vacuum and an improperly filled gem will slowly drain casters soul into it.\nIt is known that the being trapped inside the gem remains fully aware and sentient.\u00a0But a sudden death may confuse the soul making it lose the sense of time and place.\nIn most cases, if a filled soul gem is damaged it will release the soul. The trapped being will not, however, regain its physical form. &lt;a href=\"Daedric%20Princes\"&gt;Daedric Princes&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Ideal%20Masters\"&gt;Ideal Masters&lt;/a&gt; are known to posses ability to extract and alter the souls trapped inside the gems. Only known sorcerer to be able to restore a gem trapped being is the &lt;a href=\"Sload\"&gt;Sload&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"necromancer\"&gt;necromancer&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"N%27Gasta\"&gt;N'Gasta&lt;/a&gt;.\nAcquisition.\nWhite soul gems occur naturally and can be found in underground deposits just as any other gem. One of the places rich with &lt;a href=\"Geode%20Vein\"&gt;soul gem geodes&lt;/a&gt; is a vast underground cavern in &lt;a href=\"Skyrim\"&gt;Skyrim&lt;/a&gt; named &lt;a href=\"Blackreach%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Blackreach&lt;/a&gt;.\nBlack Soul Gems.\nUnlike the white soul gems, black soul gems do not occur naturally and must be created using great or grand white soul gems. Little is known about what exactly happens during the alteration of the soul gem. At least two ways of creating a black soul gem are known.\nFirst and, likely, most common way of creating a black soul gem is by the &lt;a href=\"Shade%20of%20the%20Revenant\"&gt;Shade of the Revenant&lt;/a&gt;,\u00a0a necromantic ritual performed by the\u00a0&lt;a href=\"Order%20of%20the%20Black%20Worm\"&gt;Order of the Black Worm&lt;/a&gt;. The ritual can only be performed on certain dates and in certain locations. During the ritual grand soul gems are placed as offerings to the infamous &lt;a href=\"Altmer\"&gt;Altmer&lt;/a&gt; necromancer &lt;a href=\"Mannimarco\"&gt;Mannimarco&lt;/a&gt;, who is believed to darken the gems afterward.\nThe second way of creating a black soul gem is by going directly to the &lt;a href=\"Soul%20Cairn\"&gt;Soul Cairn&lt;/a&gt;, the realm of the Ideal Masters. &lt;a href=\"Lightning%20Attractor\"&gt;Lightning attractors&lt;/a&gt; found throughout the barren landscape can transform white soul gems into black soul gems when lightning strikes them. What makes this method particularly difficult is the fact that, in order to enter the Soul Cairn, a person must be undead or partially soul trapped.\nThe knowledge of creating a black soul gem has not always been had by the men, mer and beastfolk. The first known use of a black soul gem dates &lt;a href=\"2E%20864\"&gt;2E 864&lt;/a&gt;, when a &lt;a href=\"Redguard\"&gt;Redguard&lt;/a&gt; prince &lt;a href=\"A%27Tor\"&gt;A'Tor&lt;/a&gt; was trapped inside one.\nUtilization.\nSchools of Magic.\nIt is believed, that the art of Enchanting was first developed and prized by the lost &lt;a href=\"Ayleid\"&gt;Ayleid&lt;/a&gt;. Among the modern Tamrielic races, however, skill of binding a soul to a gem and the art of Enchantment was first developed by the witch &lt;a href=\"Raven%20Direnni\"&gt;Raven Direnni&lt;/a&gt; sometime in the early\u00a0&lt;a href=\"First%20Era\"&gt;First Era&lt;/a&gt;.\nSince then dealing with souls and their power has been a part of the school of &lt;a href=\"Mysticism\"&gt;Mysticism&lt;/a&gt;, that was developed by the &lt;a href=\"Psijic%20Order\"&gt;Psijic Order&lt;/a&gt;. Soul Trap used to be considered an apprentice level spell under the school of Mysticism. In the &lt;a href=\"Fourth%20Era\"&gt;Fourth Era&lt;/a&gt;, however, the spells and dealings with souls merged with the school of &lt;a href=\"Conjuration\"&gt;Conjuration&lt;/a&gt; as the school of Mysticism no longer existed.\nEnchanting.\nAmong modern races Enchanting was first only practiced by solitary mages.\u00a0Enchanting was first popularized by the famous &lt;a href=\"Vanus%20Galerion\"&gt;Vanus Galerion&lt;/a&gt;\u00a0in the &lt;a href=\"Second%20Era\"&gt;Second Era&lt;/a&gt;. The Archmagister also invented automatized enchanting tools, that could enchant items upon a request of any unskilled individual. In &lt;a href=\"Third%20Era\"&gt;Third&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Fourth%20Era\"&gt;Fourth Era&lt;/a&gt;s\u00a0Enchanting became, probably, the most known and universally accepted use of soul gems. The fine art was kept and studied at the &lt;a href=\"Arcane%20University%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;Arcane University&lt;/a&gt;. In &lt;a href=\"4E%20174\"&gt;4E 174&lt;/a&gt; during the sack of &lt;a href=\"Imperial%20City\"&gt;Imperial City&lt;/a&gt;, much of the established knowledge in the field was lost.\nEnchanting uses the mystic power of a soul to grant items magical properties. Most commonly enchantments are made to improve personal gear, such as armor, weapons or jewelery, but improvements of other items and tools, such as quills, is also possible.\nTo enchant an item it must be melded with a filled soul gem. Usually to accomplish this an &lt;a href=\"Altar%20of%20Enchanting\"&gt;Altar of Enchanting&lt;/a&gt; or an &lt;a href=\"Arcane%20Enchanter%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Arcane Enchanter&lt;/a&gt; is used. After enchanting the improved item becomes the new prison for the soul. An unwilling soul will often go mad, however the time a soul can keep its sanity is dependent on the strength of the soul and skill of the enchanter.\nThe magical abilities of an enchanted weapon will decay on use. Thus to regain the power of the weapon quickly it is often refueled by molding in another soul gem. Sometimes enchantment may recharge over time like a persons magicka would. It is theorized, that it is the destructive nature of the weapon, that depletes the soul, or, perhaps, soul is slowly absorbed by the victims.\nArmor and jewelery enchantments behave differently. Recharge of an enchanted armor is never necessary. It is once again theorized, that this is possible due to the wearer himself contributing small amounts of energy or just by the will of the &lt;a href=\"Magnus\"&gt;Magnus&lt;/a&gt; himself.\nConjuration.\nSchool of Conjuration includes summoning of creatures and other vital resources from &lt;a href=\"Oblivion%20%28Realm%29\"&gt;Oblivion&lt;/a&gt;. After the disbandment of the school of Mysticism in the Fourth Era, school of Conjuration has also taken over the Soul Trap spell.\nUnlike the Enchanting, that completely relies of the power of the soul gems, Conjuration spells and rituals can be performed independently without any additional power sources.\nSoul can be used as currency in bargains with the daedric creatures of the Outer Realms. Exotic alchemical ingredients, daedric gear and wide range of different daedric creatures can be summoned by exchanging soul gems at an &lt;a href=\"Atronach%20Forge\"&gt;Atronach Forge&lt;/a&gt; or an &lt;a href=\"Atronach%20Altar\"&gt;Atronach Altar&lt;/a&gt;.\nSoul gems and similar magical containers can be used as a remote power outlet to maintain portals between the Nirn and Oblivion.\nNecromancy.\nNecromancy is a sub-school of Conjuration, that deals precisely with capture and utilization of black souls. It is considered to be the origin school of black soul gems.\nAny creature captured in a black soul gem is thought to be eventually sent to the Soul Cairn. The lords of the realm, &lt;a href=\"Ideal%20Masters\"&gt;Ideal Masters&lt;/a&gt;, are often communicated and bargained with by many necromancers. In exchange of souls Ideal Masters often offer great rewards, but are known to trick their followers into slavery.\n&lt;a href=\"Soul%20gem%20shards\"&gt;Soul gem shards&lt;/a&gt; are also among the ingredients necessary to open a portal to the Soul Cairn.\nTechnology.\nSoul gems are known to be included into the complex\u00a0&lt;a href=\"Dwemer\"&gt;Dwemer&lt;/a&gt;\u00a0&lt;a href=\"animunculi\"&gt;animunculi&lt;/a&gt;. Although the purpose of the gems is unknown, amateur expeditions confirm, that the soul gem is not used as the main source of power. Several different hypotheses have been made including the soul gem being the source of heat for the boilers or the soul gem being the source of Destruction magic capable of shocking transgressors. Large quantities of soul gems have been found in the Dwemer Arcanex, small structures believed to house their research in magic.\nDwemer, however, are not the only lost race to use this form of power. Ayleid are known to have used different enchantments to protect their cities and outposts. Their enchantments were, however, not powered by regular soul gems, but &lt;a href=\"Welkynd%20Stone\"&gt;Welkynd&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Varla%20Stone\"&gt;Varla stones&lt;/a&gt;.\nSoul gems can also be found powering traps and defenses in ancient Nord burial grounds and now buried fortresses and cities.\nAn interesting and still applied use of soul gems is the growth of &lt;a href=\"House%20Telvanni\"&gt;House Telvanni&lt;/a&gt; towers and towns. Mages of Telvanni use soul gems to rapidly grow the &lt;a href=\"Morrowind\"&gt;Morrowind&lt;/a&gt; native &lt;a href=\"Emperor%20Parasol\"&gt;Emperor Parasol&lt;/a&gt; to gigantic proportions. This results in the unique and organic architecture that House Telvanni possess. Strangely enough, this appliance of soul gems also seem to grow the gems themselves.\nCulture.\nWorship.\nDue to the high value of souls to all magic-users, soul gems have gained a role of appropriate offerings in many traditional and religious practices.\nProbably the most powerful entities to value the souls of mortals are the Daedric Princes. Outside the magical bargains, Princes will often demand soul gem offerings from their worshipers. Combined with knowledge in magic, offerings to the Daedra may even cure the normally incurable &lt;a href=\"Vampirism%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Vampirism&lt;/a&gt;.\nMore traditional use of soul gems, that is not a direct offering, is seen in &lt;a href=\"Morrowind\"&gt;Morrowind&lt;/a&gt;, where it is customary for the &lt;a href=\"Pilgrimages%20of%20the%20Seven%20Graces\"&gt;Pilgrims of the Seven Graces&lt;/a&gt; to leave a soul gem in remembrance of their ancestors who were bound to the &lt;a href=\"Tribunal\"&gt;Tribunal's&lt;/a&gt; service.\nYet another cult to use soul gems as offerings is the previously mentioned Order of the Worm. During their ritual in which the soul gems are offered to the Mannimarco, they recognize their once mortal idol as a deity capable of hiding his worshipers from Arkay.\nPublic opinion.\nTrade and use of white soul gems is not an uncommon sight throughout the &lt;a href=\"Tamriel\"&gt;Tamriel&lt;/a&gt;. Schools of Enchanting and Conjuration are commonly practiced. Black soul gems, with its school of origin, Necromancy, however are universally looked down upon by the general public. Immorality and heretical nature of Necromancy has been known to mages since before the recorded history. Even the legendary\u00a0&lt;a href=\"Psijic%20Order\"&gt;Psijic Order&lt;/a&gt; had forbidden the use of Black Arts.\nIn the &lt;a href=\"Septim%20Empire\"&gt;Empire&lt;/a&gt; Necromancy was first forbidden by the founder of &lt;a href=\"Mages%20Guild\"&gt;Mages Guild&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Vanus%20Galerion\"&gt;Vanus Galerion&lt;/a&gt;. The law has been questioned and even ignored by many mages since, resulting in a heavier enforcement by the Arch Mage &lt;a href=\"Hannibal%20Traven%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;Hannibal Traven&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"3E%20433\"&gt;3E 433&lt;/a&gt;. Since then any Necromantic research had to be heavily monitored by the Mages Guild, and anyone who practice the school outside was considered an enemy of the guild, making him a target for the &lt;a href=\"Order%20of%20the%20Lamp\"&gt;Order of the Lamp&lt;/a&gt;.\nIn &lt;a href=\"Skyrim\"&gt;Skyrim&lt;/a&gt; the &lt;a href=\"College%20of%20Winterhold%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;College of Winterhold&lt;/a&gt; had allowed the Necromancy to some degree. Those, who ventured too far with their research were, however, expelled from the college.\nDespite the common belief in the Empire school of Necromancy is especially disliked in the ancestor-worshiping &lt;a href=\"Morrowind\"&gt;Morrowind&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href=\"House%20Telvanni\"&gt;House Telvanni&lt;/a&gt; allow necromancers to be among them, but only perform non-ritual spells with the souls of, in their opinion, lesser races - men, &lt;a href=\"Argonian\"&gt;Argonian&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Orsimer\"&gt;Orc&lt;/a&gt;.\nSee also.\nFor information about the soul gems in specific Elder Scrolls games, please see the following:"}

It is a magic stone capable of storing the \"&lt;a href=\"soul\"&gt;soul&lt;/a&gt;\" of a &lt;a href=\"Creatures%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;creature&lt;/a&gt;. The gems are used to &lt;a href=\"recharge\"&gt;recharge&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Enchanted%20Weapons%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;magical weapons&lt;/a&gt;, or to create new &lt;a href=\"Enchanting%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;enchantments&lt;/a&gt;.\nLocations.\nSoul gems are available for purchase from most &lt;a href=\"Alchemy%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;alchemical&lt;/a&gt; and magical &lt;a href=\"Merchants%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;merchants&lt;/a&gt;. They can also be looted from &lt;a href=\"Mage%20%28Class%29\"&gt;mages&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Necromancer%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;necromancers&lt;/a&gt;.\nValue.\nEmpty soul gems, whether looted or bought, have a value based on the grade of the gem, which does not change if filled later. Merchant gems sold or found filled with a soul have a value based on the level of the soul, regardless of the grade of gem.\nCharging.\nThere are a few ways to charge soul gems:\nTypes.\nSoul gems come in various sizes. The bigger the gem, the greater the \"soul\" that can be stored in it. The charge level is used for both enchanting and recharging:\nRecharging costs.\nThe base prices for filled soul gems, other than Azura's Star and black soul gems, range from 40 for a filled petty soul gem to 500 for a filled grand gem, and these prices can be reduced using &lt;a href=\"Mercantile%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;Mercantile&lt;/a&gt;. Conversely, recharging a weapon from a character is at a fixed 1 per charge point that cannot be haggled down. Since the prices for filled gems are generally an order of magnitude less than the charge they provide, it is always cheaper to buy soul gems than to pay for recharging.\nAzura's Star.\nAzura's Star is a reusable Soul Gem, obtained by completing &lt;a href=\"Azura\"&gt;Azura&lt;/a&gt;'s &lt;a href=\"Quests%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;quest&lt;/a&gt; at the &lt;a href=\"Shrine%20of%20Azura%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;Shrine of Azura&lt;/a&gt;.\nBlack Soul Gem.\nBlack Soul Gems hold humanoid souls (&lt;a href=\"Imperials%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;Imperial&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Argonians%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;Argonian&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Khajiit%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;Khajiit&lt;/a&gt;, etc., as well as &lt;a href=\"Daedric\"&gt;Daedric&lt;/a&gt; Kyn). All others, including Azura's Star, hold only the souls of creatures.\nAll humanoid souls have a \"grand\" value, making the value of a humanoid soul equal to that of a Gloom Wraith. Since the power level of an enchantment from Grand and Black Soul Gems are identical, this equality of soul value makes the creation of Black Soul Gems a basically unnecessary process once you start encountering more creatures possessing a Grand soul.\nCreation.\nBlack Soul Gems are created by placing a Grand Soul Gem in one of four &lt;a href=\"necromancer%20altar\"&gt;necromancer altar&lt;/a&gt;s in &lt;a href=\"Cyrodiil\"&gt;Cyrodiil&lt;/a&gt;, then casting Soul Trap on the altar at the appropriate time. They can also occasionally be found on necromancers.\nColossal Black Soul Gem.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Colossal%20Black%20Soul%20Gem\"&gt;Colossal Black Soul Gem&lt;/a&gt; is a special black soul gem with a larger capacity created by &lt;a href=\"Falcar\"&gt;Falcar&lt;/a&gt; that was meant to hold the soul of &lt;a href=\"Hannibal%20Traven%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;Hannibal Traven&lt;/a&gt;.\nUnique soul gems.\nOn the first floor of the &lt;a href=\"Leyawiin%20Mages%20Guild\"&gt;Leyawiin Mages Guild&lt;/a&gt; resides a &lt;a href=\"Containers%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;display case&lt;/a&gt;, containing uniquely sized and colored soul gems. The cabinet requires a &lt;a href=\"Keys%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;key&lt;/a&gt; to open, but the key is nowhere to be found. &lt;a href=\"Console%20Commands%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;Console commands&lt;/a&gt; can be used to unlock the case, but the gems cannot be added to the &lt;a href=\"inventory\"&gt;inventory&lt;/a&gt; or moved.\nTrapping a soul.\nTo use &lt;a href=\"Soul%20Trap%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;Soul Trap&lt;/a&gt; without having to cast the actual spell, it is possible to &lt;a href=\"Enchanting%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;enchant&lt;/a&gt; a &lt;a href=\"Weapons%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;weapon&lt;/a&gt; with the \"Soul Trap\" spell for a one-second duration. This second is sufficient in case the enchanted weapon is used to give the killing blow. If the weapon has a damaging enchantment of more than 1 second, the soul trap effect has to last longer. For example, a sword dealing five seconds of fire damage would need a soul trap effect of at least 6 seconds. An alternative method that can be used by spellcasters would be to create a spell that deals damage and to supplement this spell with a soul trap spell. Again,\u00a0the soul trap duration would need to exceed that of the other spell by at least one second. Lastly, it is also possible to soul trap creatures that the player has conjured. Actively killing the creature is required however; simply letting the spell expire is not sufficient to trap the soul.\nAnother easy way to fill soul gems is to get a &lt;a href=\"Black%20Soul%20Gem%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;Black Soul Gem&lt;/a&gt; and duplicate it with a duplicate items glitch. If you have the &lt;a href=\"Staff%20of%20Worms\"&gt;Staff of Worms&lt;/a&gt; (dropped by &lt;a href=\"Mannimarco%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;Mannimarco&lt;/a&gt; during the \"&lt;a href=\"Confront%20the%20King\"&gt;Confront the King&lt;/a&gt;\" quest), go to one of the &lt;a href=\"Bandits%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;Bandit&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"Marauder%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;Marauder&lt;/a&gt; camps around Cyrodiil. Kill all of the Bandits/Marauders except for one. &lt;a href=\"Soul%20Trap%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;Soul Trap&lt;/a&gt; this one, and kill it. Then, use the Staff of Worms to reanimate a dead bandit. Wait a few seconds, then Soul Trap it and kill it. It will count as a humanoid soul. Continue this process for as long as you like.\nLocations in the Wizard's Tower plug-in.\nAn easy place to pick up soul gems are the vault guards in &lt;a href=\"Frostcrag%20Spire%20%28Location%29\"&gt;Frostcrag Spire&lt;/a&gt; if the Wizard's Tower plug-in is installed. All guards have a soul value of Greater and respawn in three in-game days."}

Filled gems are three to four times the price of empty ones.\nMechanics.\nSoul trapping.\nTrapping souls in soul gems requires the conjuration spell Soul Trap or a soul trap enchanted weapon. Killing an enemy with the spell cast upon them or using the enchantment draws their soul into one gem of the appropriate size. If no gem of the appropriate size exists in the &lt;a href=\"inventory\"&gt;inventory&lt;/a&gt;, the soul is captured by a higher-capacity gem. If there is no empty gem large enough, the soul is lost.\nAn example of a weapon enchanted with the ability to capture souls is the &lt;a href=\"Mace%20of%20Molag%20Bal%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Mace of Molag Bal&lt;/a&gt;. In , souls can be captured by activating a &lt;a href=\"soul%20fissure\"&gt;soul fissure&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;a href=\"Soul%20Cairn%20%28Dawnguard%29\"&gt;Soul Cairn&lt;/a&gt;, so long as an empty soul gem is in the inventory. Activating a soul fissure will fill the highest level blank soul gem available.\nBound weapons.\nBound weapons such as the &lt;a href=\"Bound%20Sword%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;bound sword&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"Bound%20Bow%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;bow&lt;/a&gt; can automatically soul trap attacked enemies if the &lt;a href=\"Conjuration%20%28Skyrim%29%23Perks\"&gt;Conjuration perk&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Soul%20Stealer\"&gt;Soul Stealer&lt;/a&gt; has been taken.\nSoul size.\nSoul size is determined by enemy type. Generally, smaller or lower-leveled creatures possess lesser, petty, or common souls, such as &lt;a href=\"Fox%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;foxes&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Falmer%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Falmer&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"Chaurus%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Chaurus&lt;/a&gt;. Larger or higher-leveled creatures possess greater or grand souls, such as &lt;a href=\"Mammoth%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;mammoths&lt;/a&gt; (grand) or &lt;a href=\"Giant%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;giants&lt;/a&gt; (greater).\nHumanoid races possess grand souls, but can only be trapped in a black soul gem or the &lt;a href=\"Daedric%20Artifacts%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Daedric artifact&lt;/a&gt; the Black Star, which is obtained through the &lt;a href=\"The%20Black%20Star%20%28Quest%29\"&gt;quest&lt;/a&gt; of the same name. Falmer, draugr and &lt;a href=\"Riekling%20%28Dragonborn%29\"&gt;Rieklings&lt;/a&gt; are an exception, as their souls may be captured in standard gems.\nTypes.\nSoul gems are separated into types based on the capacity they can carry. The soul gem types are petty, lesser, common, greater, grand and black.\nSouls.\nThe following are creatures that give souls:\nBlack Soul Gems.\nIn addition to the creatures above, black soul gems can be used for gathering souls from:\nAfter a black soul gem is used, the soul used is sent to the Soul Cairn, a &lt;a href=\"Oblivion%20%28Realm%29\"&gt;plane of Oblivion&lt;/a&gt; where only the dead and the undead can exist, under normal circumstances."}

And I, in turn, must rescue you.\"\nSpeak to Lyris; she explains the situation as best she can and answers a few of your questions.\n\"The Prophet! He's a prisoner here too. It was very dangerous for him to speak to you, even for a moment. He must think you can help me.\"\nThe Bleeding Forge.\nFollow Lyris through the door into the Bleeding Forge and battle &lt;a href=\"Vaekar%20the%20Forgemaster\"&gt;Vaekar the Forgemaster&lt;/a&gt;, who must be defeated in order to proceed further. Continue through the forge to the Towers of Eyes.\nThe Towers of Eyes.\nMake your way to either of the two indicated gateways and up the slope, fighting any Dremora, &lt;a href=\"Clannfear%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Clannfear&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Feral%20Shriven\"&gt;Feral Soul Shriven&lt;/a&gt; that get in your way. At the top you'll find the &lt;a href=\"Coldharbour%20Sentinel\"&gt;Coldharbour Sentinel&lt;/a&gt; \u2014 a giant eyeball. Wait for it to look the other way, sneak up behind it, and attack it.\nAfter destroying the Sentinel, retrace your steps and head to the Prophet's cell in the south. You find that it's warded, and so another way must be found. Lyris mentions that &lt;a href=\"Cadwell\"&gt;Cadwell&lt;/a&gt;, the oldest non-feral Soul Shriven, probably knows a way around.\n\"Damn it! Destroying the Sentinel must have triggered these wards. We'll need to find another way in. Hmm. Maybe Cadwell can help us.\"\nCadwell can be found in a camp to the southwest. After expressing skepticism over the Vestige's odds, Cadwell tells of a passage known as the Undercroft, which is filled with traps and enemies.\n\"Hello, what's this? Out for a stroll, then? Lovely day for it.\"\nThe Undercroft.\nFollow the river southeast to a locked door. You can &lt;a href=\"Lockpicking%20%28Online%29\"&gt;pick the lock&lt;/a&gt;, but since its difficulty is \"Trivial\" the odds of forcing it successfully are 100%.\nInside the cavern, several skeletons and Feral Soul Shriven will be guarding the way; although they can be killed, they can also be completely avoided without a penalty. Several fire traps also stand in the way, which must be waited-out in order to avoid taking damage.\nThe Prophet's Cell.\nFollow Lyris down the tunnel into the main part of the cell, where you find the Prophet suspended in magic. Lyris informs the Vestige that someone living must take his place, and so she volunteers herself, warning that guards are sure to appear.\n\"There's a trick to opening the cell. The only way for a prisoner to leave is for another living soul to take their place. I need to swap places with the Prophet.\"\nAs Lyris begins the ritual, several Dremora appear. Defeat them, then activate the two Dark Pinions and wait for the exchange to be completed.\nThe Prophet will appear in her place, freed from his bonds. He notes that the Soul-Shriven player is the Vestige, and, therefore, is too important to leave in Coldharbour. He mentions that the only way to return to Tamriel is to get to the Dark Anchor.\n\"Thank the Divines, you are safe! There is that, at least. Lyris sacrificed everything, that we might go free. Her sacrifice must not be in vain.\"\nHead to the cell's other door, which leads to the Dark Anchor Mooring.\nThe Dark Anchor Mooring.\nAs you approach the center of the room, the &lt;a href=\"Child%20of%20Bones\"&gt;Child of Bones&lt;/a&gt; appears to stop you., which also must be defeated to escape. It is the final boss of The Wailing Prison, and will use several different attacks, including grabbing you. After defeating it you can loot its corpse for the &lt;a href=\"Collar%20of%20Bones\"&gt;Collar of Bones&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe Prophet notes that you will need a Skyshard to restore your physical form, and uses his magic to summon one.\n\"The Dark Anchor's portal is high above us. I will prepare a spell to lift us to it. But first, you must re-attune yourself to Nirn in order to regain your physical form. To do this, you will need a skyshard.\"\nAfter you absorb the Skyshard, the Prophet casts a levitation spell to lift both of you to the portal. Wait for him to finish, then jump into the rift to escape Coldharbour.\nBack in Tamriel.\nYou find yourself back at the starting island for your alliance: &lt;a href=\"Khenarthi%27s%20Roost\"&gt;Khenarthi's Roost&lt;/a&gt; for the &lt;a href=\"Aldmeri%20Dominion%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Aldmeri Dominion&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Bleakrock%20Isle\"&gt;Bleakrock Isle&lt;/a&gt; for the &lt;a href=\"Ebonheart%20Pact\"&gt;Ebonheart Pact&lt;/a&gt;, or &lt;a href=\"Stros%20M%27Kai%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Stros M'Kai&lt;/a&gt; for the &lt;a href=\"Daggerfall%20Covenant\"&gt;Daggerfall Covenant&lt;/a&gt;. The Prophet arrives in a different location and speaks to you as a vision. He describes his location, which depends on your alliance.\n\"As I feared, we arrived in different locations.\"\nDominion: \"I am in a city near the sea, in a land of eternal spring. The air smells of the ocean, and of markets, and gardens.\"\nCovenant: \"I am in a city of industry, where men speak of intrigues and plots beneath layers of innuendo and pleasantry.\"\"\nPact: \"I am in a place with the smell of burning ash on a hot wind, and the sounds of a distant battle.\"\"\n\"It matters not. You have awakened once again and we must set you on your path.\""}

If the shout kills the opponent, it fills a &lt;a href=\"Soul%20Gem%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;soul gem&lt;/a&gt;, and the opponent is raised from the dead as an ally. The shout cannot be used too close to the &lt;a href=\"Last%20Dragonborn\"&gt;Dragonborn&lt;/a&gt;, so be sure to aim the crosshair away from the body. The soul trapping effect of Soul Tear only works when an empty soul gem is in the Dragonborn's possession. Furthermore, the shout only works when all three Words of Power are used.\nThe full shout deals 300 &lt;a href=\"Damage%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;damage&lt;/a&gt;. Enemies killed with the full shout and below level 100 are &lt;a href=\"Soul%20Trap%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Soul Trapped&lt;/a&gt; and then reanimated for 60 seconds. After that time or when killed, the reanimated corpse becomes an Ash Pile.\nWord locations.\nSoul Tear is obtainable from the &lt;a href=\"Undead%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;undead&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Dragons%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;dragon&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Durnehviir\"&gt;Durnehviir&lt;/a&gt;. During the Dragonborn's adventure in &lt;a href=\"Soul%20Cairn%20%28Dawnguard%29\"&gt;Soul Cairn&lt;/a&gt;, they defeat the dragon, Durnehviir. Later, he is encountered again and teaches the shout called &lt;a href=\"Summon%20Durnehviir\"&gt;Summon Durnehviir&lt;/a&gt; to the Dragonborn. The first three times Durnehviir is summoned, he teaches the Dragonborn the words of Soul Tear, one at a time, though &lt;a href=\"dragon%20soul\"&gt;dragon soul&lt;/a&gt;s still must be spent to unlock the shout.\nSummon Durnehviir must also be unlocked using souls, which essentially makes the full cost of unlocking Soul Tear 6 dragon souls instead of 3.\nUsefulness.\nSoul Tear has the ability to place opponents under the Dragonborn's control who would otherwise be too powerful to raise by normal means, such as &lt;a href=\"Giant%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;giants&lt;/a&gt;, making this an incredibly powerful shout if used correctly. Note that some warrior-type enemies will have their &lt;a href=\"Weapons%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;weapons&lt;/a&gt; knocked out of their hands when attacked with Soul Tear, and this will render them much less effective without them.\nBecause Soul Tear regenerates very quickly when the first two tiers of the Shout are used, it can be used to knock back opponents more frequently than when using, for example, &lt;a href=\"Unrelenting%20Force%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Unrelenting Force&lt;/a&gt;, which has a longer cooldown for the first two tiers.\nThough &lt;a href=\"Dragons%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;dragons&lt;/a&gt; are immune to the Soul Trap and &lt;a href=\"Reanimate\"&gt;Reanimate&lt;/a&gt; aspects of Soul Tear, they will still sustain the 300 points of damage, making it a surprisingly effective attack against them (particularly at lower levels)."}

She is located in &lt;a href=\"Garlas%20Agea%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Garlas Agea&lt;/a&gt;, with a small squad of her Legion soldiers.\nBackground.\nCaptain Jena Apinia was originally stationed in the &lt;a href=\"Imperial%20City%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Imperial City&lt;/a&gt;, after she had given her Legion a break from the fighting in Cyrodiil. But when the &lt;a href=\"Dark%20Anchors\"&gt;Dark Anchors&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Planemeld\"&gt;dropped&lt;/a&gt; she ordered her Legion to retreat instead of fighting the invading &lt;a href=\"Daedra%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Daedra&lt;/a&gt;. Her idea was to live to fight another day, to wait until a time when victory was more assured.\nDue to the rush in which she and her Legion left the Imperial City, they were ill-prepared for survival in the wilderness. They had to regroup, resupply, and determine a course of action. So they headed south, away from the now-invaded capital of the shattered Empire. When they arrived at Bravil, the Captain asked Bravil's mayor for food, but were denied these resources, because the food stores that Bravil had were much-needed for the survival of its own population.\nJena's solution for this problem was to eliminate half the population of Bravil, since that would give the other half a chance to scrounge up enough food to make it though the winter, while also giving her Legion the food it needed to survive. Jena thought that the people would be grateful, but instead, they were furious, and rose up against the Captain and her Legion, forcing her to kill a good deal more than half the population, including its mayor. After their butchery of Bravil, they took off with many of Bravil's supplies and numerous valuables to finance their efforts.\nAfter this, rumors were spreading, calling the Captain the \"Butcher of Bravil\", according to the rumors she went out of her way to kill the innocent population of Bravil. After this, she got to know that an &lt;a href=\"Razum-dar%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Eye of the Queen&lt;/a&gt; was sent by &lt;a href=\"Queen%20Ayrenn%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Queen Ayrenn&lt;/a&gt;, and she sent the bulk of her Legion back to the Imperial City. She took a small squad and made for the Gold Coast, where she would face the Eye in &lt;a href=\"Garlas%20Agea%20%28Online%29\"&gt;a place of her own choosing&lt;/a&gt;.\nInteractions.\n&lt;a href=\"Debts%20of%20War\"&gt;Debts of War&lt;/a&gt;.\nHelp &lt;a href=\"Razum-dar%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Razum-dar&lt;/a&gt; in retrieving the stolen items of Bravil and in killing Captain Jena Apinia.\nConversations.\nRazum-dar: \"Butcher of Bravil!

{"id": "935419", "revid": "17401442", "url": "https://elderscrolls.fandom.com/wiki?curid=935419", "title": "Cards", "text": "Cards are the primary gameplay mechanic in . They are used to attack, defend, destroy, or kill other cards or the player. Cards usually have one of six attributes: &lt;a href=\"Strength%20%28Legends%29\"&gt;Strength&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Willpower%20%28Legends%29\"&gt;Willpower&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Agility%20%28Legends%29\"&gt;Agility&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Intelligence%20%28Legends%29\"&gt;Intelligence&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Endurance%20%28Legends%29\"&gt;Endurance&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Neutral\"&gt;Neutral&lt;/a&gt;. However, some cards have more than one attribute, such as &lt;a href=\"Tyr\"&gt;Tyr&lt;/a&gt; which has Strength and Willpower, and are considered &lt;a href=\"Classes%20%28Legends%29\"&gt;Dual Attribute&lt;/a&gt;.\nDescription.\nDecks.\nDecks can have up to three attributes. Triple attribute cards are compulsory in a deck with three attributes, though this does not apply to decks with two attributes. Multi-attribute cards are stronger and usually cost more. Decks are made up of fifty to seventy-five cards, and can be made up of four card types.\nRarity.\nCards have different rarity, which reflects the chance of getting a card in a pack. For example, players are more likely to receive a common card such as &lt;a href=\"Fiery%20Imp\"&gt;Fiery Imp&lt;/a&gt; faster than a legendary card such as &lt;a href=\"Blood%20Magic%20Lord\"&gt;Blood Magic Lord&lt;/a&gt;. There are four rarities in the game:\nLegendary cards have a special border around them. Those with an orange gem at the top are unique cards and limited to one per deck.\nCards also have a &lt;a href=\"Magicka\"&gt;Magicka&lt;/a&gt; Cost. The player receives +1 Magicka every turn, starting with 1 Magicka. Some cards can increase your Magickaa when in play. The &lt;a href=\"Black%20Marsh%20Smugglers\"&gt;Black Marsh Smugglers&lt;/a&gt; deck relies on this. The stronger the card, the more Magicka it costs. Some cards can increase your Magicka upon summon or as long as it is in play.\nAcquisition and upgrades.\n&lt;a href=\"Soul%20Gem%20%28Legends%29\"&gt;Soul Gems&lt;/a&gt; are used to create cards, as an alternative to receiving cards through &lt;a href=\"Card%20Pack\"&gt;Card Pack&lt;/a&gt;s. Each card belongs to a certain type of set: Core, &lt;a href=\"Fall%20of%20the%20Dark%20Brotherhood\"&gt;Fall of the Dark Brotherhood&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Heroes%20of%20Skyrim\"&gt;Heroes of Skyrim&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Houses%20of%20Morrowind\"&gt;Houses of Morrowind&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Isle%20of%20Madness\"&gt;Isle of Madness&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Alliance%20War%20%28Legends%29\"&gt;Alliance War&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Moons%20of%20Elsweyr\"&gt;Moons of Elsweyr&lt;/a&gt; or Promotional. The stronger the card, the more Soul Gems are needed. However, cards such as Tyr are obtained through playing story expansions. \nKeywords.\n&lt;a href=\"Keywords\"&gt;Keywords&lt;/a&gt; grant creature cards certain effects. Keywords are used commonly and most cards have keywords. Some cards can give Keywords such as &lt;a href=\"Royal%20Sage\"&gt;Royal Sage&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Mundus%20Stone%20%28Legends%29\"&gt;Mundus Stone&lt;/a&gt;. The 7 Keywords are &lt;a href=\"Drain%20%28Legends%29\"&gt;Drain&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Regenerate%20%28Legends%29\"&gt;Regenerate&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Ward%20%28Legends%29\"&gt;Ward&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Guard%20%28Legends%29\"&gt;Guard&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Charge%20%28Legends%29\"&gt;Charge&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Breakthrough\"&gt;Breakthrough&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Lethal\"&gt;Lethal&lt;/a&gt;.\nCards.\nThe following is a list of every card in the game by an attribute or a class, the combination of two and three attributes.\nStrength.\n\"Strength overpowers its enemies with brute force. Its creatures often have higher power than health, and many can attack on the turn they're played. Strength has many powerful items for your creatures, and damage from Strength attacks can sometimes spill over to your opponent.\"\nIntelligence.\n\"Intelligence relies on trickery and magic to defeat its foes. Its creatures can deflect damage and give you advantages even when they die. Intelligence inflicts damage outside of battle, prevents enemies from attacking, and extracts added benefits from spells.\"\nWillpower.\n\"Willpower runs over its foes with strength of numbers. It can quickly field a swarm of smaller creatures, then build their power and health into a greater threat. Willpower can protect you not only with its many guards, but with powerful spells to obliterate your opponent's forces.\"\nAgility.\n\"Agility outmaneuvers its foes with nimbleness and speed. It can move creatures between lanes and into cover, prey upon wounded enemies, and make extra attacks. Agility also uses curses and poison to kill creatures with a single hit, and some of its creatures benefit from direct attacks on your opponent.\"\nEndurance.\n\"Endurance overwhelms the enemy with sheer size and staying power. Its creatures often have high health, and it has many ways to heal them. Creatures with Endurance can also drain life from others, or add to your maximum magicka.\"\nNeutral.\n\"Cards without attributes are Neutral, and they can be played in any deck.\"\nArcher.\n\"The Archer controls aggressive hordes with the guile of the forests.\"\nAssassin.\n\"The Assassin has mastered elemental magicka and deadly poisons.\"\nBattlemage.\n\"The Battlemage vanquishes foes with both great magics and strength of arms.\"\nCrusader.\n\"The Crusader crushes enemies with powerful minions and destructive magicka.\"\nMage.\n\"The Mage has mastery over the elements and arcane destruction.\"\nMonk.\n\"The Monk balances strength of mind with swiftness of foot.\"\nScout.\n\"The Scout summons lethal assassins and great beasts to battle.\"\nSorcerer.\n\"The Sorcerer holds sway over the elements and mighty beasts.\"\nSpellsword.\n\"The Spellsword leads great armies while wielding destructive magicka.\"\nWarrior.\n\"The Warrior humbles enemies with aggressive fighters and hearty beasts.\"\nHouses of Morrowind.\n\"The followers of Dagoth Ur employ massive physical power to crush their opponents.\"\n\"The Hlaalu create plots to achieve their goals and consolidate their power.\"\n\"The Redoran soldiers are inspired by their leaders to win victory in battle.\"\n\"The Telvanni are master wizards who succeed with the betrayal of others.\"\n\"The Tribunal are three living gods who gain strength from the exaltations of their worshippers.\"\nAlliance War.\n\"Aldmeri Dominion, who empower their abilities through relentless attacks.\"\n\"Daggerfall Covenant, capable of mobilizing heavily armed recruits at a moment's notice.\"\n\"The Ebonheart Pact\"\n\"The Guildsworn\"\n\"The Empire of Cyrodiil\""}
{"id": "1031876", "revid": "7075644", "url": "https://elderscrolls.fandom.com/wiki?curid=1031876", "title": "Care and Feeding of Swamp Jellies", "text": "Care and Feeding of Swamp Jellies is a &lt;a href=\"Books%20%28Murkmire%29\"&gt;book&lt;/a&gt; in .\nContents.\nHi ho! If you've recently come into the possession of a &lt;a href=\"swamp%20jelly\"&gt;swamp jelly&lt;/a&gt;, or are considering owning them, then you've come to the right place! These little tooters are some of the best companions a swamp traveler could ask for and they're easy to herd if you're looking to keep livestock.\nChances are you know a bit about swamp jellies already, but how about I go over the basics to round out the gaps, yeah?\nHabitat:\nSwamp jellies are a form of wildlife native to &lt;a href=\"Black%20Marsh%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Black Marsh&lt;/a&gt;. They favor wetlands close to the coasts\u2014quite possibly they're distant relatives of the jellies found out in the ocean\u2014but swamp jellies thrive in any wet environment. Even a sweaty boot, if you're in a pinch.\nAnatomy:\nLike any other jelly, they have no bones or solid bits, just an elastic, gelatinous body and limbs. Beyond that, their size, shape, and color vary wildly between breeds. The most common type of jelly found in &lt;a href=\"Murkmire\"&gt;Murkmire&lt;/a&gt; has a frilled, bulbous body from which four tentacles hang. Those tentacles help the jelly navigate crowded spaces and capture prey, but most of the jelly's movement is controlled by tiny orifices that suck in and expel swamp gas from several bladders. I'm not really certain how the swamp jellies became airborne, but my theory is that sea jellies got washed inland by storms and survived in the swamp pools. Eventually their bladders accumulated enough swamp gas to lift them clear out of the water!\nBehavior:\nSwamp jellies are incredibly docile by nature, spending most of their time gently floating on the breeze and catching unsuspecting bugs to eat. Swamp jellies tend to lead solitary lives, really only coming together in any number to spawn, but they are social animals. These little tooters make complex calls to each other using their gas bladders. You'll find them no less talkative to you if you take one into your care and if you learn a few of these calls you can even teach swamp jellies simple obedience! It's a useful skill whether you're an enthusiast or a herder.\nDiet:\nAirborne swamp jellies subsist entirely on bugs, mostly of the flying variety, but any teeny critter that brushes against their sticky tentacles is fair game. I've seen a single swamp jelly eat as many as a thousand bugs in a day. That alone is reason enough to make one your travel companion in a place like Black Marsh. I recommend taking your herd out to graze in different locations at least three times a week. Jellies kept to one location for too long will wipe out the local insect population in a few days! If you happen to be short on bugs, a hearty spoonful of scrib jelly makes a suitable substitute.\nCare:\nSwamp jellies need humidity to survive. If your clothes aren't sticking to you, it's probably too dry for a jelly to stay for more than a couple of hours without help. Swamp jellies don't need to drink, but they can suck up water from a bowl or wide-mouthed vessel if they can't get the moisture they need from the air. Brackish water is best, but fresh or salt water is safe.\nProvide a steady supply of bugs throughout the day when you can, rather than feeding only at certain times. Hungry swamp jellies tend to binge, weighing them down and making them sluggish.\nTry not to worry if your swamp jelly suffers injury. They will heal cuts and even regrow limbs given time. You should only be concerned if your jelly is struggling to keep afloat. You may need to feed the poor little tooter by hand until its bladders can hold gas again.\nEven if you take my advice to heart, sooner or later, we've all got to say goodbye to our little tooters. Wild swamp jellies tend to live between two and three years, but domesticated swamp jellies can live as long as five years with good care.\nMeal Preparation:\nWhether you're keeping a swamp jelly as a pet or rearing them for slaughter, careful butchery is key to making sure their little gelatinous bodies don't go to waste. You'll want to grease your hands with cooking oil before handling swamp jellies, otherwise they'll stick to your fingers and you might end up pulling them apart trying to free yourself. Most of the time you'll want to remove any tentacles from the body and put them aside for later use. Just lay them out straight across your cutting board and slice across. Once you've removed the limbs, you're ready to spit the body straight down the middle. I recommend using a cleaver and some firm pressure, but anything sharp will do. Oily jellies, hands, and knives are a recipe for finger sandwiches if you aren't careful!\nAfter you wash out the body cavities, your jelly is ready for roasting over open fire or in an oven. Over red coals you'll get a firmer jelly with a bit of crisp on the outside. I usually cook the tentacles in the body and slurp them down with eel broth, but you can roast them on skewers in about ten minutes for a salty treat. Swamp jelly makes a good substitute for brain or &lt;a href=\"Reagents\"&gt;scrib jelly&lt;/a&gt; in your recipes, if you're watching your weight.\nCatching Jellies:\nIf you're looking to tame your own wild jellies, get yourself a fine net\u2014bug nets work best. Scoop the jellies gently into your net and you're done. Most swamp jellies are so harmless they won't even protest. There are a few breeds in the deepmire that are so poisonous they'll kill you if you even brush their tentacles, but no need to worry about them.\nThat's really all there is to know about catching and caring for your swamp jellies, anything else is just jam on the jelly-cakes!"}
{"id": "634473", "revid": "7075644", "url": "https://elderscrolls.fandom.com/wiki?curid=634473", "title": "Care of Kwama", "text": "Care of Kwama is a &lt;a href=\"Books%20%28Online%29\"&gt;book&lt;/a&gt; in .\nContents.\nWhile the insectoid creatures known as \"&lt;a href=\"Kwama%20%28Online%29\"&gt;kwama&lt;/a&gt;\" originated in &lt;a href=\"Morrowind%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Morrowind&lt;/a&gt;, do not be surprised to find them elsewhere in &lt;a href=\"Tamriel\"&gt;Tamriel&lt;/a&gt;. The creatures have been transported, intentionally or otherwise, to many different parts of the world.\nThe barbarous &lt;a href=\"Dunmer%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Dunmer&lt;/a&gt;, for example, keep the creatures in \"&lt;a href=\"Egg%20Mine\"&gt;egg mines&lt;/a&gt;\" because they find them a delicacy. \"Good eating!\" as one toothless old sot told me. I cannot imagine what passes for good food among the Dark Elves that they would eat insect &lt;a href=\"Kwama%20Egg\"&gt;eggs&lt;/a&gt;.\nBut the Dunmer may be on to something, in their own backward way. Kwama are, indeed, excellent miners. They prefer to live underground, creating elaborate tunnel systems as they build their warrans. The creatures consume organic material from the earth and appear to actually excrete minerals they cannot digest, such as gemstones, &lt;a href=\"gold\"&gt;gold&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"iron\"&gt;iron&lt;/a&gt;.\nAs an experiment, the &lt;a href=\"Aldmeri%20Dominion%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Aldmeri Dominion&lt;/a&gt; is transporting kwama eggs to various outer territories. There, small kwama mines can be established. The kwama can dig to their hearts' content--if they have hearts--and our kwama keepers can pull the minerals from their refuse. Much more efficient than using &lt;a href=\"Argonians%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Argonian&lt;/a&gt; captives. The bugs, at least, feed themselves.\nThere are several different kwama types within the species, and each must be dealt with in a different way.\nKwama &lt;a href=\"Scrib%20%28Online%29\"&gt;scribs&lt;/a&gt; are the kwama young and are easily managed. They're voracious but strongly influenced by food. Scribs hatch from long eggs and grown from the size of a large man's foot to the length of a large dog. The scrib may evolve into one of the other types, or it may die.\n&lt;a href=\"Kwama%20forager\"&gt;Kwama forager&lt;/a&gt;s explore the outer mine areas and are known to search the surface of the world for new territory. Kwama keepers have learned to \"steer\" foragers toward potential mine sites and away from Dominion settlements for kwama undermining can cause sinkholes. It is important for a kwama keeper to know when a forager can't be managed, as the forager must be dispatched before it can return to the mines.\n&lt;a href=\"Kwama%20Worker%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Workers&lt;/a&gt; are the most useful of the kwama and will tirelessly dig away, expanding their warrens and searching for food. It is possible for a kwama keeper to use a goad to push workers toward or away from specific sites, but risky. Workers will fight back, and an uprising in a kwama mine is a violent and dangerous event.\nA few scribs grow up to become &lt;a href=\"Kwama%20Warrior%20%28Online%29\"&gt;warriors&lt;/a&gt;. While some uneducated souls think that killing the warriors keeps the rest in line, this expert disagrees. Killing the warriors causes more scribs to evolve into the mine's protectors and soon you have nothing but the violent creatures to deal with! What's more, the warriors can command lesser kwama, which means an uprising is almost certain. If a warrior must be killed, do it quickly, and away from the rest of the nest!\nFinally, the &lt;a href=\"Kwama%20Queen\"&gt;kwama queen&lt;/a&gt;. She is a huge, bloated creature, nearly immobile and very rare. Not all hives have queens. Many are just offshoots of greater hives. But all eggs are born of a kwama queen. If one encounters a queen, move away quickly! They are not pleasant creatures and cannot be influenced. Every kwama in a hive will throw itself at a perceived \"invader\" to protect the majestic corpulence of their queen."}

She will tell you that her supplies were shipped to Haven, but due to the recent pirate attack, they have not been shipped to her location. She will ask you to retrieve them for her. \nNow that you have heard the troubles of the performers, it is your job to resolve these issues. For the magician's supplies, head to Haven. You can find them on the western pier in the south of the city, in a mystical trunk. For the mudcrab eyes, head northeast of the city, and start hunting mudcrabs on the beach. You need twelve eyes in total, so killing six mudcrabs will be enough. You can also hunt mudcrabs in on the beach in western &lt;a href=\"Grahtwood\"&gt;Grahtwood&lt;/a&gt;, but hunting them here is more efficient due to its proximity to your objective in Haven. Finally, head to the Mages Guild in Elden Root and speak to Scholar Glaurion to pick up a book for the storyteller. He has one text from an &lt;a href=\"Akaviri\"&gt;Akaviri&lt;/a&gt; spy, written in the Akaviri language. Take it, then return to the carnival. \nOnce you have obtained all the items the performers need, return to the carnival and give them the items, then speak with Sarandel again to finish the quest. If you wish, you can stay for a while and witness some of the performances."}

She secretly worked as an spy for &lt;a href=\"Emperor\"&gt;Emperor&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Titus%20Mede%20I\"&gt;Titus Mede I&lt;/a&gt;.\nPhysical appearance.\nArese was a petite blond woman of thirty-one years. She had a small frame, turned-up nose, and short blond hair that made her seem almost like a little girl. Her blue eyes held a cold intensity that was quite unchildlike. She had a black tattoo of a wolf's head, the Emperor's personal brand, on her hip.\nHistory.\n&lt;a href=\"Umbriel%20Crisis\"&gt;Umbriel Crisis&lt;/a&gt;.\nEvery time prince &lt;a href=\"Attrebus%20Mede\"&gt;Attrebus&lt;/a&gt; decided to embark in a dangerous adventure, &lt;a href=\"Gulan\"&gt;Gulan&lt;/a&gt; reported to Arese and she informed the Emperor to avoid bringing risk to the prince's life. Hierem had plotted to become Emperor, and he needed Attrebus dead. Despite Arese's refusal to use criminals to ambush and kill the prince, Hierem hired &lt;a href=\"Calvur\"&gt;Calvur&lt;/a&gt; and his men to do the job. When Attrebus planned to secretly march on &lt;a href=\"Umbriel\"&gt;Umbriel&lt;/a&gt;, Arese informed Hierem instead of the Emperor. She could not have warned Titus without revealing herself to Hierem.\n&lt;a href=\"Colin\"&gt;Colin&lt;/a&gt; discovered that Arese was responsible for not warning the Emperor about Attrebus' plans. Colin had sent some letters blackmailing Arese saying that he knew what she had done. Arese thought that the author of the letters could be one of Calvur's men, so she met them in their hideout. Colin followed Arese, who after walking through the alleyways of the &lt;a href=\"Imperial%20City\"&gt;Imperial City&lt;/a&gt; knocked the door of a house. Someone opened the door, and she entered the building. Colin discovered a window, so he climbed and casted a spell to open it.\nColin hid in the shadows and overheard the conversation between Arese and Calvur. Arese accused Calvur or one of his men of being the blackmailer. Calvur offered to deal with the blackmailer at no extra charge. Arese summoned a &lt;a href=\"daedra\"&gt;daedra&lt;/a&gt; who killed all the thugs. Arese felt that someone else was in the building, but the daedra could not find Colin. The house caught fire, and Colin scaped the building.\nArese's men discovered Colin spying on her, so she sent her thugs to kidnape him. The thugs covered Colin's head and brought her to Arese. Arese killed her men and unbound Colin. She explained Colin that she had been put in the minister's office ten years ago by the Emperor to spy on Hierem. Arese offered Colin to work with her to gather proof of Hierem's involvement in Attrebus' attack. The inspector agreed to help Arese.\nColin contacted Arese to inform her that some documents dealing with &lt;a href=\"Black%20Marsh\"&gt;Black Marsh&lt;/a&gt; had been censored in Hierem's office. Arese knew that Hierem had done a secret trip to Black Marsh. &lt;a href=\"Delia%20Huerc\"&gt;Delia Huerc&lt;/a&gt; had accompanied Hierem in the trip, but she died of an illness a few days after her return. Colin offered to inspect Delia's old home for clues.\nColin waited Arese outside her home to report his discovery. Colin realised that an assassin had infiltrated Arese's house. Arese entered the building, and Colin broke in breaking a window. Arese realised that she was being attacked, so she summoned a daedra. Colin killed the assassin, but a second assassin approached him from behind. The daedra killed the last assassin. Arese tried to heal Colin, but the tension of the situation led them to give free rein to pasion.\nColin informed Arese about his discovery, and asked her to contact the Emperor. However, the Emperor needed solid evidence. Arese ended up revealing Colin the password to contact the Emperor. Titus could not risk confronting Hierem without solid evindence so he provided Colin a key to Hierem's chambers.\nUmbriel approached the Imperial City, and Letine needed a safehouse. Colin guided her through the sewers to a secret room where she could stay. In addition, it led to the ministry. Colin intended to infiltrate in the minister's chambers to search for proof, but Arese thought that the Emperor wanted Colin to kill Hierem. Colin refused to kill the minister unless he was explicitly ordered to do so by the Emperor.\nColin came back with some sort of a map. Letine said that she knew of someone who might be able to tell her what the drawing meant. Colin was afraid that the &lt;a href=\"Dark%20Brotherhood\"&gt;Dark Brotherhood&lt;/a&gt; might still be searching for Letine, but he allowed her to leave the basement. In the meantime, Colin discovered Attrebus might be captive in Hierem's chambers.\nArese came back a few days later, but she told Colin that she could not find out anything about the diagram. Colin informed her about his discovery, so they headed to Hierem's chambers. They discovered &lt;a href=\"Attrebus%20Mede\"&gt;Attrebus&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Sul\"&gt;Sul&lt;/a&gt; locked in cells. Colin managed to open the locks. Once the prince was free, they designed a plan. Hierem was in Umbriel, when he was teleported back the his chambers, Sul and Attrebus would in turn be sent to Umbriel. Colin and Letine would attack Hierem as soon as the saw him.\nWhen Hierem appeared, Colin thrusted his knife toward the base of his skull. Yet, he did not intend to kill the minister, he wanted to interrogate him. Colin felt a sob heave up from his chest, then he slumped down to the floor. Arese summoned a daedra who attacked Hierem. The daedra wounded him severly, but he managed to defeat it. Hierem asked Letine whether she had discovered what he was up to. Letine told him what she knew. When he was about to kill Arese, Colin threw a knife at Hierem. Hierem noticed Colin's attack, and he dodged the knife. While Hierem was distracted with Colin another daedra butchered Hierem ending with his life.\nColin was confused about Letine, he asked her why she had told him she did not know what the diagram meant. Before ending the sentence, Letine slipped her knife under his ribs and left the room. Colin managed to rise. He found a secret door open, so he walked up the stairs that he encountered. He discovered Letine performing a ritual at the very axis of the &lt;a href=\"White-Gold%20Tower\"&gt;White-Gold Tower&lt;/a&gt;. She had discovered from Hierem's diagram how to steal the tower's power. She could now have enough power never to be afraid again. Letine loved Colin, and she offered him to join her, but Colin could not leave her perform the ritual. Letine started to summon a daedra, but Colin yanked the knife from his chest and aimed it at Letine. The knife hit Letine in the eye, instantly killing her."}

My only comfort is knowing that the wages I'm earning now will ensure our comfort when I return. I couldn't believe the pay this lunatic was offering, and I doubt we would have followed him all the way to &lt;a href=\"Cyrodiil\"&gt;Cyrodiil&lt;/a&gt; otherwise. The fool thinks he'll overthrow the &lt;a href=\"Septim%20Empire\"&gt;Empire&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Vaermina\"&gt;Vaermina&lt;/a&gt; take him! I figure we'll end up deserting soon, just as soon as we've gotten as much pay as we can without actually following this addled madman into battle.\nWe've hardly crossed the border, but already I can tell you: Cyrodiil is an awful place. We have nothing but iron to work with. There's no art to &lt;a href=\"Iron%20Armor%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;iron armor&lt;/a&gt;. I tried using the bones of beasts killed in the local forest, but they are brittle and won't bear the force of the hammer. \nEven with decent materials, this would be a dull post. We must be a mile underground and a league from civilization. I don't envy the courier who carries this letter! I pass the time in conversation with the other apprentice. We always seem to have a good laugh at the expense of &lt;a href=\"the%20Forgemaster\"&gt;the Forgemaster&lt;/a&gt;; in private, of course.\nI can't wait to see your family home in Suran. I've never actually been to &lt;a href=\"Vvardenfell\"&gt;Vvardenfell&lt;/a&gt;; I've heard much of it's charm. I'm pleased and suprised to hear that you've begun saving for our own home already. You say you're working for somebody named &lt;a href=\"Desele%27s%20House%20of%20Earthly%20Delights%20%28Morrowind%29\"&gt;Desele&lt;/a&gt;? The pay must be very good, but when I return you won't need to keep it up. You never mentioned, by the way, what sort of work you're doing.\nI'm still not sure how this crazy wizard is paying wages for us and his army of mercenaries and laborers. We don't use half the ore mined here for smithing, so I figure he must sell the surplus iron, but I see no evidence of it, nor do I think it would produce such a fortune. I think he's &lt;a href=\"House%20Telvanni%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;Telvanni&lt;/a&gt;, perhaps folk in the area near you have heard if he's from wealthy stock?\nI fear I must conclude, my love; the forgemaster is demanding another parcel of iron-shod boots. How many more pairs could we possibly need?"}

While searching for the whereabouts of your brother Ernanthil, I discovered that your bodyguard, Inimoro, has been stealing from your coffers.\nI know you trust him with your life, so it must wound you dearly to hear this news. Still, as heir to your father's business and fortune, you must learn that even the staunchest of allies can be bewitched by the allure of &lt;a href=\"Septim%20%28Coin%29\"&gt;coin&lt;/a&gt;.\nThat unpleasant news aside, I hope you are well. Please remember to write your mother, she misses you dearly.\nYour faithful charge, Alrano"}

Please read this privately, and I beg you to exercise discretion in discussing its contents with your advisors.\nOf utmost importance are matters related to security here in &lt;a href=\"Alcaire%20Castle\"&gt;Alcaire&lt;/a&gt;, and unfortunately, though I have strong concerns, I do not have the convenience of a simple or even a consistent element to which I might ascribe Alcaire's troubles of late.\nAt the time of my last communication, there were only a few reports of these &lt;a href=\"Vaermina\"&gt;Vaermina&lt;/a&gt; cultists, the Supernal Dreamers. Our shared hopes of this being a short-lived problem were not realized. It seems the cultists have grown even bolder\u2014raiding outlying farms and even recruiting citizens to join their mad ranks. The Knights of the Flame have orders to arrest cult members on sight, but we await further instruction from you on how to deal with a threat that has now spread to other regions of &lt;a href=\"Stormhaven%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Stormhaven&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe Knights of the Flame continue to prove invaluable allies and staunch defenders of the realm. They have been instrumental in helping me address the cultist problem and in reacting to an attempt made on the duchess' life by an &lt;a href=\"Alik%27r\"&gt;Alik'r&lt;/a&gt; assassin. The leader of the Knights of the Flame, one Sir Hughes, suggested that the order assume responsibility for security here at the castle, and I was relieved to agree. It has been a weight lifted off my shoulders.\nLastly, and most personally, I wish to express my most sincere gratitude for the arrangement of my marriage to &lt;a href=\"Duchess%20Lakana\"&gt;Princess Lakana&lt;/a&gt;. Though I feared our union of political necessity would be formal and awkward, nothing could be further from the truth. Her warmth and kindness have created an intimacy between us that I never dreamt possible.\nWe both owe you our gratitude and our undying loyalty.\nYours truly,\nNathaniel\nP.S.: The tricks these Redguard women employ in the bedchamber\u2026! Why didn't you warn me, you old dog?"}

I am indeed alive, and no, I haven't forgotten my promise to you, which I remind you again was never literal.\nYou see, when someone says \"You'll be the death of me\", it's not an invitation to murder. It's more of a loving expression of one's exasperation, but I know your nuance has never been your strong suit.\nI must warn you, however, that correspondence like this endangers us both. So if you truly wish to keep this promise, it's best you don't respond. When the time is right, I will come to you.\nOh, and be kind to our merchant friend Gunther, will you? Consider him my gift to you, along with this book on our past life.\nI'm sure you know by now, but it seems one of us has taken to writing about our adventures. I assure you, this isn't me. But I'm glad his depiction of you is as honest as you are incorrigible.\n--Edward"}
