The patron deity of the Imperial Legion is &lt;a href=\"Stendarr\"&gt;Stendarr&lt;/a&gt;, god of Justice and Mercy, though many among the Legions are also followers of the Talos cult. The Legions meet annually in the Legionary's Council, in which decisions made by the &lt;a href=\"Elder%20Council\"&gt;Elder Council&lt;/a&gt; are discussed among the Legions.\nBackground.\nThe Imperial Legion proclaims itself to be the most disciplined and effective military and police force in history, and that it preserves the peace and rule of &lt;a href=\"Imperial%20Law\"&gt;law&lt;/a&gt; in the Empire. In , the &lt;a href=\"Nerevarine\"&gt;Nerevarine&lt;/a&gt; may join the Legion, perform tasks for them, and eventually rise in rank up to the highest one, the \"Knight of the Imperial Dragon.\" While playing heavily into the previous installment of the series, \"Morrowind's\" sequel, , featured the Legion, yet gave the Hero of Kvatch no opportunity to sign up as a legionnaire. In , the &lt;a href=\"Last%20Dragonborn\"&gt;Dragonborn&lt;/a&gt; can &lt;a href=\"Joining%20the%20Legion\"&gt;join the Legion&lt;/a&gt; and aid them in fighting against the Stormcloaks in the Skyrim Civil War. The Legion also captured and attempted to behead the Dragonborn upon entering &lt;a href=\"Skyrim\"&gt;Skyrim&lt;/a&gt;, beginning the game, because they believe that they are affiliated with the &lt;a href=\"Stormcloaks\"&gt;Stormcloaks&lt;/a&gt;, along with &lt;a href=\"Lokir\"&gt;Lokir&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Ralof\"&gt;Ralof&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Ulfric%20Stormcloak\"&gt;Ulfric Stormcloak&lt;/a&gt;.\nHistory.\n&lt;a href=\"First%20Era\"&gt;First Era&lt;/a&gt;.\nAlessian Empire.\nThe predecessor to the Imperial Legions were the Alessian Legions. These Legions were led by &lt;a href=\"Morihaus\"&gt;Morihaus&lt;/a&gt; during their siege of the &lt;a href=\"White-Gold%20Tower\"&gt;White-Gold Tower&lt;/a&gt; against the &lt;a href=\"Ayleid\"&gt;Ayleid&lt;/a&gt;s. Under the command of Empress &lt;a href=\"Hestra\"&gt;Hestra&lt;/a&gt;, the Alessian Legions would invade the city of &lt;a href=\"Verkarth\"&gt;Verkarth&lt;/a&gt;, conqeuring it, and causing its former king, the Vampire &lt;a href=\"Styriche\"&gt;Styriche&lt;/a&gt;, to assemble a large army known as the Gray Host to invade the Bangkorai Garrison. This invasion was halted, however, through Saint Pelin's sacrifice and the defense of the garrison. The Gray Host, following their defeat, scattered and were cut down by the Legionnaires. Empress Hestra was impressed with the defense of the Garrison, and honored High Rock with admission into the First Empire.\nAfter a thousand years had passed, the &lt;a href=\"Alessian%20Order\"&gt;Alessian Order&lt;/a&gt; had obtained a tight grip on the Imperial Throne, and due to their policies, High Rock sought to secede. The Order was unwilling to let High Rock go peacefully, and sent the Legions of Piety and Grace into the province, under the command of the Abbot-General Priscus Mactator. The Legion filled the &lt;a href=\"Fallen%20Wastes\"&gt;Fallen Wastes&lt;/a&gt; with Legionnaires, but his army could not advance past the Bangkorai Garrison, and after five months of siege, the General admitted defeat and fell back to Cyrodiil. The Alessian Empire at this time also had slave camps, where people who had to serve as slaves were brought to. During one of the cohort patrols in &lt;a href=\"High%20Rock\"&gt;High Rock&lt;/a&gt;, some Legionnaires were killed by a band of mercenaries. The mercenaries had little success, as their attacks were parried and blocked, while getting cut down. In Skyrim, the Legions fought against &lt;a href=\"Kjoric%20the%20White\"&gt;Kjoric the White&lt;/a&gt;, and successfully killed the King during the &lt;a href=\"Battle%20of%20Sungard\"&gt;Battle of Sungard&lt;/a&gt;. While the &lt;a href=\"Pact%20of%20Chieftains\"&gt;Pact of Chieftains&lt;/a&gt; was electing his successor, the Legions were also reclaiming the southern lands of Skyrim that it had lost. One of the key elements marking the end of the Alessian Empire was the failed invasion of the Colovian Estates. The Emperor &lt;a href=\"Gorieus\"&gt;Gorieus&lt;/a&gt;, following years of disease and the king of Skingrad being new, thought to unify Cyrodiil through the use of the Legions. He marched to Skingrad with overwhelming numbers but was ambushed. When King Rislav of Skingrad spoke to the Emperor, he let his hawk fly, a signal his archers had been waiting for. While the Legions were in the pass, they had nowhere to go and were easy targets for the Colovian archers. After a long chase by the Legions in an attempt to slay Rislav, they met the army of Kvatch, the Legions likely still outnumbered their foe, but they were exhausted and morale was low. After an hour of fighting, they fled to what is now the &lt;a href=\"Imperial%20Reserve\"&gt;Imperial Reserve&lt;/a&gt;, and went further north and east from there. Another noteworthy battle in High Rock is the &lt;a href=\"Battle%20of%20Glenumbra%20Moors%20%28Event%29\"&gt;Battle of Glenumbra Moors&lt;/a&gt;, where the Direnni and the Bretons fought against the Alessian forces. Hoag Merkiller, High King of the Nords, was also slain in this battle.\n&lt;a href=\"Blackwater%20War\"&gt;Blackwater War&lt;/a&gt;.\nDuring the First Era, the Imperial Legion existed as part of the Reman Empire. A notable war in the First Era called the &lt;a href=\"Blackwater%20War\"&gt;Blackwater War&lt;/a&gt; erupted around &lt;a href=\"1E%202811\"&gt;1E 2811&lt;/a&gt;, during which the &lt;a href=\"Fourth%20Legion\"&gt;Fourth Legion&lt;/a&gt; attempted to take and maintain control over &lt;a href=\"Black%20Marsh\"&gt;Black Marsh&lt;/a&gt;. Their Argonian opponents, however, were easily able to use the Legion's ineffective equipment and tactics in the swamps to their advantage.\nBy &lt;a href=\"1E%202820\"&gt;1E 2820&lt;/a&gt;, the forces in Black Marsh had been destroyed. By &lt;a href=\"1E%202823\"&gt;1E 2823&lt;/a&gt;, the Legion had adapted to Black Marsh's climate with more fitting equipment and tactics. In &lt;a href=\"1E%202828\"&gt;1E 2828&lt;/a&gt;, the Legion accidentally started a massive fire known as the \"&lt;a href=\"Great%20Burn\"&gt;Great Burn&lt;/a&gt;,\" which destroyed a significant portion of the province during its three-year rampage, again forcing the Legion to retreat. However, by &lt;a href=\"1E%202837\"&gt;1E 2837&lt;/a&gt; the Legion had won the war and officially claimed Black Marsh for the Empire.\n&lt;a href=\"Second%20Era\"&gt;Second Era&lt;/a&gt;.\n&lt;a href=\"Three%20Banners%20War\"&gt;Three Banners War&lt;/a&gt;.\nDuring the &lt;a href=\"Alliance%20War\"&gt;Alliance War&lt;/a&gt;, the Imperial Legion was mostly fighting the Daedra invading the Imperial City. Despite this, the Legions were also fighting the &lt;a href=\"Ebonheart%20Pact\"&gt;other&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Aldmeri%20Dominion%20%28Online%29\"&gt;alliances&lt;/a&gt;, mainly the &lt;a href=\"Daggerfall%20Covenant\"&gt;Daggerfall Covenant&lt;/a&gt;.\nDaggerfall Covenant.\nIn the lands of &lt;a href=\"High%20Rock\"&gt;High Rock&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"Seventh%20Legion\"&gt;Seventh Legion&lt;/a&gt; held the &lt;a href=\"Bangkorai%20Garrison\"&gt;Bangkorai Garrison&lt;/a&gt;, effectively blocking off half of the &lt;a href=\"Bangkorai\"&gt;Bangkorai&lt;/a&gt; region from Covenant reinforcements. The Legion was also making headway to capturing the city of &lt;a href=\"Evermore\"&gt;Evermore&lt;/a&gt;, largely through the aid of spies and its duke, &lt;a href=\"Duke%20Renchant\"&gt;Duke Renchant&lt;/a&gt;, being cooperative. However, this attempt failed, and in a supposed parley, &lt;a href=\"Septima%20Tharn\"&gt;Septima Tharn&lt;/a&gt; demanded the unconditional surrender of Evermore. &lt;a href=\"Queen%20Arzhela\"&gt;Queen Arzhela&lt;/a&gt; tried to stab Septima in her rage, but Septima was using an illusion, after this the Seventh Legion tried to kill the Queen. In this same region, they raided the &lt;a href=\"Knights%20of%20Saint%20Pelin\"&gt;Knights of Saint Pelin&lt;/a&gt; at &lt;a href=\"Martyr%27s%20Crossing\"&gt;Martyr's Crossing&lt;/a&gt;, and stole their supplies. They did this due to Martyr's Crossing being an important trade route between north and south Bangkorai. The last of the Legion's known successes is the capturing of &lt;a href=\"Hallin%27s%20Stand\"&gt;Hallin's Stand&lt;/a&gt;, also in Bangkorai, due to the &lt;a href=\"Hall%20of%20Heroes\"&gt;Hall of Heroes&lt;/a&gt; being located close to it. Their success is attributed due to them attacking at night and due to working with a spy. High Rock wasn't the only province plagued by the Legion, in the province of Hammerfell, the Legion held Satakalaam, due to them being in league with the &lt;a href=\"Withered%20Hand\"&gt;Withered Hand&lt;/a&gt;. The &lt;a href=\"Seventh%20Legion\"&gt;Seventh Legion&lt;/a&gt; would eventually be destroyed at the &lt;a href=\"Hall%20of%20Heroes\"&gt;Hall of Heroes&lt;/a&gt;.\nAldmeri Dominion.\nWhile nowhere near as significant as its victories against the Covenant, the Legion also held a bit of territory in Aldmeri lands. The Legion held the city of &lt;a href=\"Arenthia\"&gt;Arenthia&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Vile%20Manse\"&gt;Vile Manse&lt;/a&gt; with &lt;a href=\"Colovian\"&gt;Colovian&lt;/a&gt; Legions and were making headway to conquering &lt;a href=\"Vinedusk%20Village\"&gt;Vinedusk Village&lt;/a&gt;. Their forces used in their assault of the village were stationed in an encampment located just outside the city. The Legion also held some minor territory in &lt;a href=\"Malabal%20Tor\"&gt;Malabal Tor&lt;/a&gt;, in the &lt;a href=\"Crimson%20Cove\"&gt;Crimson Cove&lt;/a&gt;. These soldiers were known as &lt;a href=\"Crimson%20Raider\"&gt;Crimson Raider&lt;/a&gt;s, and were originally suspected to be pirates. They had been raiding ships of the Dominion, sometimes up to a dozen a month.\nCyrodiil.\nIn the province of Cyrodiil, a lot of the Legion was in active duty, being recalled from their normal postions, including Imperial forces at forst. Legion forces were scattered across the wilds, and set up outposts, to keep an eye out for Pact, Covenant and Dominion movement. The Legions also engaged in combat with Covenant, Pact and Dominion units. Specifically, the Legion under the command of &lt;a href=\"Captain%20Jena%20Apinia\"&gt;Captain Jena Apinia&lt;/a&gt;, who eventually fled the Imperial City when her Legion was on a break, due to the &lt;a href=\"Planemeld\"&gt;Planemeld&lt;/a&gt; starting. In their retreat they exterminated over half of Bravil's population, due to what they considered was the only way possible to prevent the people (and soldiers) from starving, while others, including &lt;a href=\"Queen%20Ayrenn\"&gt;Queen Ayrenn&lt;/a&gt;, took to calling it a massacre and labeled the Captain as a war criminal. The bulk of this Legion was eventually sent to retake the city, adding more Legion soldiers to the fight on the Imperial Bridges, who were trying to kill Molag Bal's &lt;a href=\"Daedra\"&gt;Daedra&lt;/a&gt; despite being unable to get over to the island through normal means. In the Imperial City itself, the vast majority of &lt;a href=\"Legion%20Zero\"&gt;Legion Zero&lt;/a&gt; had already betrayed the Empire, and sworn loyalty to &lt;a href=\"Mannimarco\"&gt;Mannimarco&lt;/a&gt; and his &lt;a href=\"Worm%20Cult\"&gt;Worm Cult&lt;/a&gt;, as well as &lt;a href=\"Molag%20Bal\"&gt;Molag Bal&lt;/a&gt;, except for a handful of Legion soldiers, who made an improvised garrison in the &lt;a href=\"Nobles%20District\"&gt;Nobles District&lt;/a&gt;. In the city of &lt;a href=\"Cheydinhal\"&gt;Cheydinhal&lt;/a&gt;, a rebellion broke out as a result of the Legionnaires stationed there going rogue after the Empire's collapse. The reason as to why the rebellion broke out is not clear. One of the rebel leaders claims it is for domination over Cheydinhal and nothing else, the other claims it was because the soldiers forced the townsfolk to keep them fed, and because of forceful enlistment.\nTiber Wars.\nAfter the Alliance War had ended, Tamriel was at relative peace. Tiber Septim, who had been a General of Cuhlecain in the past, became Emperor after the death of his lord. The Tiber Wars were a result of Tiber Septim being set on his path to conqeur Tamriel by the Greybeards. It started in &lt;a href=\"2E%20854\"&gt;2E 854&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"2E%20855\"&gt;2E 855&lt;/a&gt; and lasted until &lt;a href=\"3E%200\"&gt;3E 0&lt;/a&gt;.\nAfter Tiber Septim beat the Nord-Breton alliance at &lt;a href=\"Sancre%20Tor\"&gt;Sancre Tor&lt;/a&gt;, he had the troops needed to conquer the Heartlands from the Imperial Battlemages. After Cyrodiil had been unified, Cuhlecain died. Talos was then crowned Emperor by &lt;a href=\"Zurin%20Arctus\"&gt;Zurin Arctus&lt;/a&gt;, his battlemage. Septim found the initial administration of a fully united Cyrodiil a time-consuming task, as such, he sent the Underking to deal with the Imperial expansion into the provinces of High Rock and Skyrim.\nDuring the Tiber Wars, the Colovians held on to their frontier spirit, still being known for being uncomplicated, self-sufficient, hearty, and extremely loyal to one another. When Cyrodiil crumbled, the Colovians split from the rest of Cyrodiil, in the idea that they would keep the national spirit safe. Colovians accepted that the Nibenese are the heart of the Empire and its cultural center of civilization, but they are aware that only a strong Emperor can hold it together. As such, Tiber Septim was considered a strong Emperor, and many Colovians were glad to aid their Emperor, forming his legions. During the Tiber Wars, the Colovians made up the majority of the soldiers in the Imperial Legions. The entire Colovian nobility became officers in the legions or the navy, and were considered humble, not caring for the great expenditure of court life as seen in the Imperial City, but instead caring more for their uniforms and standards hanging from the Imperial forts. Colovian Officers are traditionally also appointed as provincial governors to the human regions of the Empire, due to their loyalty to the Emperor.\nHigh Rock was easily conquered by the Empire, and the Bretons were largely welcoming of the new Empire. The governor of High Rock, &lt;a href=\"Titus%20Alorius\"&gt;Titus Alorius&lt;/a&gt;, put down most rebels in the land, and resolved the feuding between kings with tact and skill, which resulted in the Empire being seen positively. By &lt;a href=\"2E%20864\"&gt;2E 864&lt;/a&gt;, High Rock was solidified by the Empire.\nSkyrim's conquest is largely unknown. What is known is that Skyrim's occupation seems like a ballet in comparison to Hammerfell's invasion. It is also known that the warchiefs of &lt;a href=\"Danstrar\"&gt;Danstrar&lt;/a&gt; fought against Septim's forces. After Skyrim was conquered, the Nord Kings expected to outlast Septim's Empire, just as they had done with the previous ones. Following the successful conqeuring of Skyrim, the city of &lt;a href=\"Windhelm\"&gt;Windhelm&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Eastmarch\"&gt;Eastmarch&lt;/a&gt; would serve as a base for Imperial troops who guarded the &lt;a href=\"Dunmeth%20Pass\"&gt;Dunmeth Pass&lt;/a&gt; into Morrowind.\nBlack Marsh was the third nation to be invaded and conqeured by Tiber Septim. Combat between the Legions and Argonians was recorded in &lt;a href=\"2E%20861\"&gt;2E 861&lt;/a&gt;. Tiber Septim invaded the coastlines of Black Marsh, but avoided the unimportant inner swamps. Most of Black Marsh eventually joined through a treaty.\nHammerfell was the next nation to fall to Talosian conquest. The High King of Hammerfell, &lt;a href=\"Thassad%20II\"&gt;Thassad II&lt;/a&gt;, feared Imperial invasion. In order to prevent the Empire from invading Hammerfell, he signed a pact with the Forebears to ensure unity. After the death of Thassad, this pact turned void, as the Crowns and Forebears both tried to claim ownership over Hammerfell. The Forebears were losing the war, and when defeat was certain, they signed a pact with the Emperor, to allow his Legions to claim parts of Hammerfell in return for his aid during their Civil War. When Baron Volag disappeared at the end of the war, these terms were rendered void, and all of Hammerfell was claimed by the Empire. After a civil war on Stros M'Kai proved successful, Sentinel followed in its steps. Tiber Septim, not wanting Hammerfell to rebel against him, came to Stros M'Kai to negotiate the terms of the &lt;a href=\"Treaty%20of%20Stros%20M%27kai\"&gt;Treaty of Stros M'kai&lt;/a&gt; with &lt;a href=\"Baron%20Volag\"&gt;Baron Volag&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Iszara\"&gt;Iszara&lt;/a&gt;.\nWith Morrowind surrounded by Imperial territory, Septim decided to launch an invasion on Morrowind. The Legions assembled at the border between Cyrodiil and Morrowind, and invasion fleets prepared in Skyrim. The Dunmer were not united in their ideas of how to act. The &lt;a href=\"Telvanni\"&gt;Telvanni&lt;/a&gt; remained neutral, &lt;a href=\"Hlaalu\"&gt;Hlaalu&lt;/a&gt; proposed accommodation, while the &lt;a href=\"Dres\"&gt;Dres&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Redoran\"&gt;Redoran&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Indoril\"&gt;Indoril&lt;/a&gt; wanted to fight until the death. Small border skirmishes took place between the Legions and Dunmer in Black Marsh, but the swampy terrain did not suit either for warfare. To combat the Legions near &lt;a href=\"Blacklight\"&gt;Blacklight&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Kragenmoor\"&gt;Kragenmoor&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Cormar%20View\"&gt;Cormar View&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Silgrad%20Tower\"&gt;Silgrad Tower&lt;/a&gt;, the Dunmer only had small militias aided by Redoran Mercenaries and House nobles, alongside &lt;a href=\"Buoyant%20Armigers\"&gt;Buoyant Armigers&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Ordinator\"&gt;Ordinator&lt;/a&gt;s. This became even more troubling for the Dunmer when only the Redoran wanted to defend the western border, as the Indoril and Dres wanted to wage a guerrilla war against the Empire. One of the battles that took place during these wars was the battle of &lt;a href=\"Mournhold\"&gt;Mournhold&lt;/a&gt;, which laid waste to the city. When &lt;a href=\"Vivec\"&gt;Vivec&lt;/a&gt; himself appeared to announce that Morrowind would join the Empire under gracious circumstances to the native people, he was met with an awkward silence. The Dres and Indoril still stood strong in wishing to resist to the death, while the Redoran, who now had an excuse to not lose most of their territory, joined the side of House Hlaalu in supporting accommodation. The Telvanni, seeing which way the situation was going, also joined the Hlaalu in supporting accommodation. Many of the Indoril, after being forced into joining the Empire, committed suicide, resulting in the Hlaalu gaining a lot of power in Morrowind.\nThe next province to fall was either Elsweyr or Valenwood.\n&lt;a href=\"Elsweyr\"&gt;Elsweyr&lt;/a&gt; had a pact with the &lt;a href=\"Second%20Aldmeri%20Dominion\"&gt;Second Aldmeri Dominion&lt;/a&gt;, a military alliance. The city of &lt;a href=\"Senchal\"&gt;Senchal&lt;/a&gt; was raided by the &lt;a href=\"Third%20Legion\"&gt;Third Legion&lt;/a&gt; after the city had refused to surrender. When Elsweyr fell exactly is unknown.\n&lt;a href=\"Valenwood\"&gt;Valenwood&lt;/a&gt; had joined the Dominion as a result of the &lt;a href=\"Thalmor\"&gt;Thalmor&lt;/a&gt; gaining power in Valenwood with the support of &lt;a href=\"Camoran%20Anaxemes\"&gt;Camoran Anaxemes&lt;/a&gt;. When the Third Empire started to take shape, the Dominion tightened its grip on Valenwood, Bosmer tribes fought against Colovian forces along the &lt;a href=\"Strid%20River\"&gt;Strid River&lt;/a&gt;, until the Empire became unified. Both sides then made up camp at their sides of the border, both waiting for the decisive battle. When the Dominion tried to fight the Empire's forces they lost a great many times, with the Colovians calling them the \"Old Mary Dominion,\" as a reference to the weak offense the Dominion offered on the land. Contrary to the land battles, at sea the Aldmeri Navy crushed the Imperial Navy, and ruled the seas from the &lt;a href=\"Cape%20of%20the%20Blue%20Divide\"&gt;Cape of the Blue Divide&lt;/a&gt; until the &lt;a href=\"Topal%20Bay\"&gt;Topal Bay&lt;/a&gt;. Both Valenwood and the &lt;a href=\"Summerset%20Isles\"&gt;Summerset Isles&lt;/a&gt; fell to Tiber Septim when he used the Numidium to conquer the remaining provinces of Tamriel.\n&lt;a href=\"Third%20Era\"&gt;Third Era&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe Legion fought in several wars and conflicts during the &lt;a href=\"Third%20Era\"&gt;Third Era&lt;/a&gt;, among them the &lt;a href=\"War%20of%20the%20Red%20Diamond\"&gt;War of the Red Diamond&lt;/a&gt;, and they also fought in the conflict of the &lt;a href=\"Camoran%20Usurper\"&gt;Camoran Usurper&lt;/a&gt;.\nWar of the Red Diamond.\nThe War of the Red Diamond was a war fought between the loyal forces of &lt;a href=\"Kintyra%20Septim%20II\"&gt;Kintyra Septim II&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Potema%20Septim\"&gt;Potema Septim&lt;/a&gt; as a result over a throne dispute, and started in &lt;a href=\"3E%20121\"&gt;3E 121&lt;/a&gt;. While the forces of Kintyra were loyalists to the Empire, those of Potema were the nobility that had become disgruntled by the Empire. As most of Potema's allies were located in High Rock and Skyrim, the rebels were initially successful, and slaughtered the Legions stationed there. They also incited riots and insurrections everywhere they went. Six years later, Potema saw her last victory, in the battle of Falconstar. In this fight, Potema and Lord Vhokken attacked the Argonian forces of Magnus Septim, eventually resulting in Magnus retreating. In the same year the son of Potema, &lt;a href=\"Uriel%20Septim%20III\"&gt;Uriel Septim III&lt;/a&gt;, fought in the battle of ichidag. However, the prince was outnumbered and outmatched, resulting in his army losing and the prince getting captured by Cephorus Septim. While being transported to Gilane, the prince's carriage got attacked by an angry mob, resulting in his death and Cephorus proclaiming himself Emperor. As a result of the death of the prince, many of Potema's allies decided to switch sides and support Cephorus' claim for the throne. With Potema losing allies, she started making pacts with the Daedra and necromancers, which resulted in her losing even more allies. In &lt;a href=\"3E%20127\"&gt;3E 127&lt;/a&gt; Potema's army had been pushed back to Solitude, and ten years later, this army was pushed back to the Blue Palace itself, where they were beaten.\nInvasion of Akavir.\nIn &lt;a href=\"3E%20270\"&gt;3E 270&lt;/a&gt;, Emperor &lt;a href=\"Uriel%20Septim%20V\"&gt;Uriel Septim V&lt;/a&gt; created plans of conquering &lt;a href=\"Akavir\"&gt;Akavir&lt;/a&gt;. Shortly after these plans were made, the Emperor would begin his conquest of the small island kingdoms between Tamriel and Akavir. The first island to be conquered was &lt;a href=\"Roscrea\"&gt;Roscrea&lt;/a&gt;, which was claimed in &lt;a href=\"3E%20271\"&gt;3E 271&lt;/a&gt;, followed by &lt;a href=\"Cathnoquey\"&gt;Cathnoquey&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"3E%20276\"&gt;3E 276&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Yneslea\"&gt;Yneslea&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"3E%20279\"&gt;3E 279&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Esroniet\"&gt;Esroniet&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"3E%20284\"&gt;3E 284&lt;/a&gt;. Esroniet itself was not conquered in one go, &lt;a href=\"Black%20Harbor\"&gt;Black Harbor&lt;/a&gt;, a port of the island, was conquered in &lt;a href=\"3E%20282\"&gt;3E 282&lt;/a&gt; and immediately renovated for the Emperor's invasion plans, at the same time, he ordered the building of the ships that would carry his Legions over to Akavir. When Prince &lt;a href=\"Bashomon\"&gt;Bashomon&lt;/a&gt; of Esroniet yielded Esroniet to the Emperor in &lt;a href=\"3E%20284\"&gt;3E 284&lt;/a&gt;, the Emperor's full attention was focused on the invasion of Akavir. In &lt;a href=\"3E%20285\"&gt;3E 285&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"3E%20286\"&gt;3E 286&lt;/a&gt;, ships were sent out to Akavir to scout the lands, with &lt;a href=\"Blades\"&gt;Blades&lt;/a&gt; on board to find information about the land. The &lt;a href=\"Tsaesci\"&gt;Tsaesci&lt;/a&gt;, whose kingdom lies to the southwest of Akavir, was based on the scouting forces, chosen for the initial landing of the Emperor's forces. At the same time, the Emperor was gathering his Legions and navy which was called the \"Expeditionary Force.\" A new &lt;a href=\"Far%20East%20Fleet\"&gt;Far East Fleet&lt;/a&gt; created for the invasion, which dwarfed the rest of the &lt;a href=\"Imperial%20Navy\"&gt;Imperial Navy&lt;/a&gt;. Four Legions, the &lt;a href=\"Fifth%20Legion\"&gt;Fifth&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Seventh%20Legion\"&gt;Seventh&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Tenth%20Legion\"&gt;Tenth&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Fourteenth%20Legion\"&gt;Fourteenth Legion&lt;/a&gt; were chosen for the initial landing, with the &lt;a href=\"Ninth%20Legion\"&gt;Ninth&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Seventeenth%20Legion\"&gt;Seventeenth Legion&lt;/a&gt;s being chosen as reinforcements when the coastline was conquered. The reasoning for this decision was the idea that there would be little resistance, supply lines would be difficult to manage, and, most importantly, the Fleet could only transport four Legions at once.\nThe invasion itself started on 23rd &lt;a href=\"Rain%27s%20Hand\"&gt;Rain's Hand&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"3E%20288\"&gt;3E 288&lt;/a&gt;, with the Expeditionary Force leaving Black Harbor. Only 6 weeks later, due to fair weather, the invasion force arrived on Akavir and claimed a Tsaesci port due to its proximity to Tamriel, as well as its location being near a fertile river, which provided easy access to the interior as well as easy foraging. When the Legions settled the town, they named it &lt;a href=\"Septimia\"&gt;Septimia&lt;/a&gt;, created fortifications surrounding it, and built a port suitable for the Far East Fleet. Meanwhile, the Emperor, alongside two other Legions, advanced through Akavir, discovering rich well-watered fields in the area, as well as another abandoned settlement, which the Legions took over, and renamed to &lt;a href=\"Ionith\"&gt;Ionith&lt;/a&gt;, where the Emperor put his headquarters due to its location being better suited for domination of the surrounding lands. Though no fighting had taken place, enemy forces were spotted by the Legions, who were chased away by Imperial scouts. One of the things the Emperor's army lacked was cavalry due to the limited room for transport on the Fleet, at the time, the &lt;a href=\"Imperial%20Legion%20Battlemage%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;Imperial Legion Battlemages&lt;/a&gt; made up for this with magical reconnaissance. Instead of the Emperor pushing onward into Akavir, he sent &lt;a href=\"Imperial%20Legion%20Messenger\"&gt;Imperial Legion Messenger&lt;/a&gt;s to find out who ruled the lands in an attempt to make them yield by the mere sight of the Legions. While the messengers were being sent, the remaining forces of the four Legions started with building a road between Septimia and Ionith, including fortified guard posts along the river. Despite this, communications between the two cities was slow, as messengers were constantly attacked on the road.\nThe two Legions that had remained on Tamriel were originally meant to travel to Akavir after the port of Septimia was fitting for the navy, but this plan was changed to instead transport colonists. This was decided to ensure that the Legions did not have to rely on the fleet for supplies, but instead create their own. Additionally unrest came to Yneslea, and the two reinforcement Legions would be better used there, due to securing the supply lines of the fleet. When the colonists arrived some cavalry was brought along as well, which resulted in the small Akaviri raids coming to an end. Additionally, Tsaesci emissaries arrived in Ionith to talk about peace negotiations. In the winter season the Expeditionary Force had limited supplies due to heavy storms on the seas to Tamriel, and any foraging or scouting unit got killed by Tsaesci raiders, who also took over some forts during blizzards, while other forts were just abandoned by the Legions.\nOn the 5th of &lt;a href=\"Sun%27s%20Dawn\"&gt;Sun's Dawn&lt;/a&gt;, a Tsaesci force marched to Ionith, claiming to offer peace from their king. This proved to be a trick, as the Tsaesci killed the Imperial guards watching over one of the city gates, allowing a great number of their allies to march in. The soldiers of the Tenth Legion spotted the Tsaesci, and sounded the alarm, after which the remaining Tsaesci inside the city were hunted down. This was also the end of the negotiations between the Tsaesci and the Empire.\nSince spring, the weather had turned increasingly worse, and would stay that way for months, resulting in supply fleets getting greatly weakened by storms. The Emperor decided to send his Battlemages with the fleet in order to combat the weather, as the storm had caused the fleet to shrink in size, no longer being able to transport the four Legions already on Akavir. The Elder Council urged the Emperor to sail back to Tamriel, but due to the decrease of fleet capacity, the Emperor decided not to. From this point onward, disaster became inevitable. Communications between Imperial Battlemages were bad, as the mages on Akavir stated their power was weaker than normal. Even communications between master and pupil of years of training were bad. It is unknown if Akaviri wizards played a part in this, but the Commission of the invasion did order the Imperial War college to study the magical abilities of the Tsaesci, in the event that the Empire would cross with them again.\nIn mid-Sun's Height, the Emperor marched out of Ionith with his Legions, save for small garrisons left behind in Septimia and Ionith, as he had learned of a Tsaesci force assembling to the north of the city past a mountain. The Emperor wanted to smash this force before they could invade, and take their supplies, as the Imperial supplies were running low. Though the Emperor and his Legions successfully defeated the Tsaesci and captured one of their nobles, they were forced to retreat by Tsaesci warriors, who made the Emperor lose a large amount of forces on his way back to Ionith. When he had returned to the city, the Tsaesci besieged Ionith, as well as Septimia. The Imperial Battlemages had to use their magical powers to create water to sustain the armies, instead of harming the enemies, which was a skill that the War College, normally, did not focus on. Though the Far East Fleet arrived safely in Black Harbor, thanks to the Imperial Battlemages aboard the ship, it had gotten no chance to return due to great storms that damaged Esroniet in 289.\nIn Frostfall, the Fleet was sent out to Akavir again, and, after a long silence between Akavir and Tamriel, communications were made between the Emperor's battlemage and the battlemages of Tamriel. The Emperor's battlemage reported that the city of Ionith still held out, and the Fleet alongside the Emperor's forces quickly made a plan to fall back from Akavir. The Emperor and his Legions would break out of Ionith and fall back to Septimia, where the fleet would meet them and sail them back to Tamriel. However, only a small force of the Emperor's army arrived at Septimia. Two days before the fleet arrived, the Emperor decided to break out of Ionith, successfully fighting through the Tsaesci's armies at first, until being surrounded by an overwhelming army on the road to Septimia. The Emperor and the Tenth Legion fought a heroic last stand to give a remnant of the Fourteenth Legion a chance to reach Septimia. Two soldiers of the Tenth Legion also managed to escape during the victory celebrations of the Tsaesci, who reported that they had seen the Emperor die by arrows as he rallied the Shield Wall of their Legion. When the Fleet arrived, Septimia's garrison was under heavy assault by the Tsaesci, and through the aid of the Imperial Battlemages aboard the Fleet, the Tsaesci were pushed back for long enough to get the survivors of the failed invasion on the ships, after which they returned to Tamriel. The Imperial Commission and Elder Council realized that the Empire, in its state at the time, had no chance against the Akaviri, and would not have a chance in the foreseeable future.\n&lt;a href=\"3E%20427\"&gt;3E 427&lt;/a&gt;, the Legions of Vvardenfell.\nDuring &lt;a href=\"3E%20427\"&gt;3E 427&lt;/a&gt;, the Legion held a presence in the major settlements of Vvardenfell, namely Ebonheart, Pelagiad, Balmora, Ald'Ruhn, and Gnisis. Consisting of several Legions, including the &lt;a href=\"Deathshead%20Legion\"&gt;Deathshead&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Hawkmoth%20Legion\"&gt;Hawkmoth Legion&lt;/a&gt;. The entire Legion force in Morrowind was led by &lt;a href=\"Varus%20Vantinius\"&gt;Varus Vantinius&lt;/a&gt;, Knight of the Imperial Dragon and member of the Order of Ebonheart. Many Orcs came to Vvardenfell as Legion veterans after serving in the Legions, due to their Imperial service ensuring their citizenship while other legion veterans constructed the town of &lt;a href=\"Pelagiad\"&gt;Pelagiad&lt;/a&gt;. Within Vvardenfell, cultural conflicts were not uncommon, and only the Duke of the District and the assistance of the Legions prevented the District from erupting into unrest or warfare. Despite this, bandits, necromancers and witches still plagued the land in sparsely populated districts, due to the lack of time and forces the Legion troops had, they could not clear out the wilderness. It had been stated that the Legion garrisons in Morrowind were insufficient to protect its settlements, and that there was no hope for Imperial reinforcements to be sent to the province.\nThe Legion attempted to obtain territory on Gnisis to construct another port for the town, following the death of &lt;a href=\"Mansilamat%20Vabdas\"&gt;Mansilamat Vabdas&lt;/a&gt;. It would later be found out that Vabdas had been murdered by &lt;a href=\"Lugrub%20gro-Ogdum\"&gt;Lugrub gro-Ogdum&lt;/a&gt;, a good soldier with a reputation of being easy to anger. Upon discovery, General Darius ordered the man killed. The Legion further secured the Gnisis Eggmine after its Kwama Queen had contracted the &lt;a href=\"Blight\"&gt;Blight&lt;/a&gt;, ensuring the local miners could continue their work. A conspiracy had also started forming among some members of the Deathshead Legion, specifically the ones following the Talos Cult. These soldiers considered Emperor Uriel Septim a weak Emperor, and wanted him replaced by a strong ruler. Their plans were ultimately stopped by the order of General Darius after he found out about the plot.\nIn Ald'ruhn the Legion worked against the illegal trading of Dwemer artifacts, as Dwemer artifacts were protected by Imperial Decree, and considered part of the Emperor's property. Ald'ruhn's garrison was also tasked with saving &lt;a href=\"Joncis%20Dalomax\"&gt;Joncis Dalomax&lt;/a&gt;, a knight of the Order of Ebonheart, from his captors. The garrison also prevented a Buoyant Armiger from being blackmailed, by recovering the object used for the blackmail.\nThe Hawkmoth Legion in Ebonheart concerned itself with different matters, often related to the Tribunal. As the Legion was called out for having no courtesy by a Buoyant Armiger, &lt;a href=\"Frald%20the%20White\"&gt;Frald the White&lt;/a&gt; sent out a Legionnaire to prove the opposite, in order to keep favor with the Dunmer people. But the Legion also had to face a traitor, deal with slanders, and allow a murderer to be given a fair trial.\nThe Legion on Vvardenfell had a bad reputation among the local &lt;a href=\"Ashlanders\"&gt;Ashlanders&lt;/a&gt; and some of the more traditional Dunmer. The Ashlanders stated that the Imperials would come and burn their yurts and kill their children. The Legion also barely acted on the abolitionist movements, which were trying to end slavery, resulting in most Dunmer viewing them as hypocritical because of the Empire's proclamations regarding protection of property and preserving law and order. In attempts to gain favor with the Dunmer, the Legion, despite Necromancy being legal, also dealt with &lt;a href=\"Sorkvild%20the%20Raven\"&gt;Sorkvild the Raven&lt;/a&gt;, a Necromancer near &lt;a href=\"Dagon%20Fel\"&gt;Dagon Fel&lt;/a&gt;, as the Dunmer despised Necromancers. The Ashlanders acknowledged that in open fields, the Legions were undefeatable, but in the ashlands they had the upper hand. At the same time, Ashlanders captured and enslaved innocent civilians, resulting in the Legion being sent out to rescue the civilians, sometimes resulting in the death of Ashlanders. The Ashlanders also attacked caravans and pilgrims, raided villages, and fought with the Legions. However, despite this, no heavy Legion action was taken against the Ashlanders. The &lt;a href=\"Nerevarine\"&gt;Nerevarine&lt;/a&gt; was tasked with dealing with a Sixth House Base after a Legion patrol unit had been effectively wiped out by its members.\n&lt;a href=\"Larrius%20Varro\"&gt;Larrius Varro&lt;/a&gt;, the Legion Champion at Fort Moonmoth, also had business to deal with on Vvardenfell. Larrius had found out that corruption took place in the city of Balmora, where the Camonna Tong paid off magistrates to allow criminals to walk freely. Varro tasked a Legionnaire with killing the Camonna Tong members, as the magistrate would have too powerful allies. He further sent the Legionnaire to deal with an outlaw who had been robbing travelers near Hla Oad.\nVarus Vantinius the Knight of the Imperial Dragon on Vvardenfell, and head of all the Legions in Morrowind, had lost the &lt;a href=\"Lord%27s%20Mail%20%28Morrowind%29\"&gt;Lord's Mail&lt;/a&gt;, a powerful artifact owned by his order. He tasked a high ranking Legionnaire with finding the cuirass and bringing it back to him. The cuirass had been stolen by &lt;a href=\"Furius%20Acilius\"&gt;Furius Acilius&lt;/a&gt;, a Legionnaire who had been kicked out of the Legion and desired revenge. Likewise, &lt;a href=\"Chrysamere\"&gt;Chrysamere&lt;/a&gt;, another artifact owned by the Legion, had also been stolen and was kept by &lt;a href=\"Draramu%20Hloran\"&gt;Draramu Hloran&lt;/a&gt; until being returned to Varus Vantinius. If questioned over his position, Varus would rather die than give it up. As such, people who desired his position had to face him in a duel to the death.\nLegion action in the Empire.\nWithin Cyrodiil, unrest had started to sparkle due to the Emperor, Uriel Septim VII, being sick and his heirs being presumed as doppelgangers put in place by &lt;a href=\"Jagar%20Tharn\"&gt;Jagar Tharn&lt;/a&gt;. Because of this, many people demanded the deaths of the heirs, and the Legion within the province charged the mob, resulting in many casualties. Because of this unrest, there was a common fear that the Legions might be recalled to defend the Emperor, though it is never stated this took place. At the same time, rumors began to sparkle regarding the lifting of the War Tax at the command of the Emperor, due to the last war having taken place over ten years prior to &lt;a href=\"3E%20427\"&gt;3E 427&lt;/a&gt;.\nSome criticism was made on the Legion forces in the eastern provinces of Black Marsh and Morrowind. It was said that the recruiting of new Legion forces, alongside maintaining the garrisons was too costly considering the low threat the provinces could pose if they sought to attack the Empire. Because of this, some suspicions were made regarding the Imperial Generals of these Legions, as they did not face opposition or enemies some feared they could set their eyes upon the western part of the Empire. A combination of veteran troops and monopolist influences gave these Legions some political potential.\nWithin Skyrim, there was record of one Nord village which was attacked by bandits three years prior to the Oblivion Crisis. Despite the requests made at the local Legion outpost, no aid was sent out by the Legionnaire in charge of the outpost. The reasons for this refusal are unknown.\nSolstheim.\nWhen the East Empire Company found a source of ebony on the island of Solstheim, the Legion created &lt;a href=\"Fort%20Frostmoth\"&gt;Fort Frostmoth&lt;/a&gt; to defend the Company's settlement of &lt;a href=\"Raven%20Rock\"&gt;Raven Rock&lt;/a&gt;. This fort was under the command of Captain Falx Carius. The majority of the troops garrisoned at the fort were sent to the island due to past offenses, and these troops were not the best soldiers. The troops had performed their duties properly for a long time, but they did eventually turn restless, and complained a lot. The performance of their duties had decreased, and their morale was low. The &lt;a href=\"Nerevarine\"&gt;Nerevarine&lt;/a&gt; would discover that the cause of the lower morale was a lack of alcohol in the fort. Where as in the past the garrison was allowed to drink alcoholic beverages, the supply had stopped, resulting in the soldiers becoming upset. In reality, alcohol did continue to come into the fort, but the priest of the fort, &lt;a href=\"Antonius%20Nuncius\"&gt;Antonius Nuncius&lt;/a&gt;, hid it in his room in hopes of being discharged from the island following a revolt by the troops. Whether Antonius was punished for his deeds is unknown, but it is known that after the news arrived to the Captain, the alcohol in the fort returned to the troops.\nThe Captain would task the Nerevarine with another task afterwards. Many of the Legionnaires at the fort as a means of replacing their prison sentences in Ebonheart. As such, some smuggling started to take place at the fort, as the weapons in the armory started to decrease. The smuggling was considered dangerous, as the fort had limited supplies, and the lack of equipment could result in the troops becoming restless. &lt;a href=\"Zeno%20Faustus\"&gt;Zeno Faustus&lt;/a&gt;, the Imperial blacksmith at the fort, would inform the Nerevarine and his companion of some weapons being stashed in the &lt;a href=\"Gandrung%20Caverns\"&gt;Gandrung Caverns&lt;/a&gt;, which were located just northeast of the fort. Within the caverns, a number of Legionnaires attempted to kill the Nerevarine and his companion, only to fail. If &lt;a href=\"Saenus%20Lusius\"&gt;Saenus Lusius&lt;/a&gt; was the companion of the Nerevarine, one of the smugglers, named &lt;a href=\"Gualtierus%20Spurius\"&gt;Gualtierus Spurius&lt;/a&gt;, attempted to make a deal in order to be let go. Wether this deal was accepted or not is unknown.\nWhen the Nerevarine returned to the fort, it had been attacked by werewolves. The Legionnaires were caught by surprise, and there was a terrible battle. In the aftermath, the Legionnaires discovered that Captain Carius had gone missing, and as such, the Skaal were suspected to have been involved due to their connections to nature.\nThe Captain would eventually return to Tamriel following the completion of the Bloodmoon Prophecy.\nThe Legion at the fort would see other action, however. For several months, someone had been poisoning people across Solstheim with moon sugar. At first the Legion did not get involved, but when &lt;a href=\"Jeleen\"&gt;Jeleen&lt;/a&gt;, an Imperial Cult Priest was poisoned, it turned into an Imperial matter. It would turn out that the criminal was &lt;a href=\"Uncle%20Sweetshare\"&gt;Uncle Sweetshare&lt;/a&gt;, and to prove his death, his &lt;a href=\"White%20Colovian%20Fur%20Helm\"&gt;White Colovian Fur Helm&lt;/a&gt; was demanded. Whether Uncle Sweetshare was killed, or if his helm was just taken, is unknown.\nA few years after Raven Rock was built, the &lt;a href=\"Nords\"&gt;Nords&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"Solstheim\"&gt;Solstheim&lt;/a&gt; tried to conquer the island from the Legion and the &lt;a href=\"East%20Empire%20Company\"&gt;East Empire Company&lt;/a&gt;. Though unsuccessful, the Nords did kill a lot of Imperial Soldiers on the island. Later, during the Oblivion Crisis, the Nords made another attempt, which ended up being equally unsuccessful, with the garrison remaining intact until being wiped out by the eruption of Red Mountain in &lt;a href=\"4E%205\"&gt;4E 5&lt;/a&gt;.\nOblivion Crisis.\nA noteworthy event for the Legions was the Oblivion Crisis. As a result of the murder of &lt;a href=\"Emperor%20Uriel%20Septim%20VII\"&gt;Emperor Uriel Septim VII&lt;/a&gt; and his three heirs, &lt;a href=\"Geldall%20Septim\"&gt;Geldall&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Enman%20Septim\"&gt;Enman&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Ebel%20Septim\"&gt;Ebel&lt;/a&gt;, no new Emperor of the Dragonblood was crowned in time to relight the &lt;a href=\"Dragonfires\"&gt;Dragonfires&lt;/a&gt;, resulting in the creation of &lt;a href=\"Oblivion%20Gate\"&gt;Oblivion Gate&lt;/a&gt;s by the &lt;a href=\"Mythic%20Dawn\"&gt;Mythic Dawn&lt;/a&gt;. The Oblivion Crisis was devastating for the Imperial provinces, originally starting at the Colovian city of &lt;a href=\"Kvatch\"&gt;Kvatch&lt;/a&gt; in an attempt to find &lt;a href=\"Martin%20Septim\"&gt;Martin Septim&lt;/a&gt;, gates to Oblivion started to appear all across Tamriel.\nThe Legions in &lt;a href=\"Cyrodiil\"&gt;Cyrodiil&lt;/a&gt; were greatly outnumbered, with soldiers only being sent to Kvatch and &lt;a href=\"Fort%20Sutch\"&gt;Sutch&lt;/a&gt;. Some soldiers from southern Cyrodiil were called up north to defend the capital, but in the midst of this unit, near &lt;a href=\"Pell%27s%20Gate\"&gt;Pell's Gate&lt;/a&gt;, a Gate to Oblivion appeared, which killed off around half of its forces, including its commander. After this, the Imperial Captain &lt;a href=\"Tertius%20Ione\"&gt;Tertius Ione&lt;/a&gt;, mustered farmers and hunters from the countryside and sacrificed himself, alongside half of his men, to close the gate. Following his death and the destruction of the gate, the town called &lt;a href=\"Ione\"&gt;Ione&lt;/a&gt; was built, named in his honor. The Legions from &lt;a href=\"Fort%20Swampmoth\"&gt;Fort Swampmoth&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Black%20Marsh\"&gt;Black Marsh&lt;/a&gt; were recalled due to the &lt;a href=\"An-Xileel\"&gt;An-Xileel&lt;/a&gt; and other &lt;a href=\"Argonians\"&gt;Argonians&lt;/a&gt; successfully beating the Daedra back, the &lt;a href=\"Redoran\"&gt;Redoran&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Dunmer\"&gt;Dunmer&lt;/a&gt; claim that the Legions were recalled from &lt;a href=\"Morrowind\"&gt;Morrowind&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Solstheim\"&gt;Solstheim&lt;/a&gt;, however the Legions in the provinces, besides Black Marsh, were not recalled according to High Chancellor &lt;a href=\"Ocato\"&gt;Ocato&lt;/a&gt;. According to Ocato, this was because of a mixture of the Legions already being fully committed, and the political situation of the Empire. The count of &lt;a href=\"Leyawiin\"&gt;Leyawiin&lt;/a&gt; also pointed out how the Empire focused more on the provinces rather than Cyrodiil itself, and how the Empire never provided Legion soldiers in County Leyawiin, despite heavy need for them. Indeed, almost as soon as the crisis broke out, the people in Cyrodiil spoke of the Legions being stretched to the limit across the Empire to deal with the crisis.\nWhatever the case, the lack of troops in Cyrodiil resulted in the Cyrodiilic counties having to fend for themselves during the Crisis. If the &lt;a href=\"Hero%20of%20Kvatch\"&gt;Hero of Kvatch&lt;/a&gt; aided the cities of Cyrodiil, they would send aid to &lt;a href=\"Bruma\"&gt;Bruma&lt;/a&gt;, which would become subject to a plan of the &lt;a href=\"Blades\"&gt;Blades&lt;/a&gt; to retrieve the &lt;a href=\"Amulet%20of%20Kings\"&gt;Amulet of Kings&lt;/a&gt;. If the Hero did not aid the other cities, Bruma would send their own, weaker, militia instead. After the Amulet was retrieved from Paradise, &lt;a href=\"Martin%20Septim\"&gt;Martin Septim&lt;/a&gt;, a bastard child of Uriel VII, made his way to the &lt;a href=\"Imperial%20City\"&gt;Imperial City&lt;/a&gt; and was crowned Emperor. His plan was to light the Dragonfires as soon as he was crowned, but only a moment after he became Emperor, an &lt;a href=\"Imperial%20Legion%20Messenger\"&gt;Imperial Legion Messenger&lt;/a&gt; arrived with the news that Oblivion Gates were created all across the city.\nLegion soldiers from the &lt;a href=\"Imperial%20Legion%20Offices\"&gt;Imperial Legion Offices&lt;/a&gt; arrived at the &lt;a href=\"Imperial%20Palace\"&gt;Imperial Palace&lt;/a&gt; to defend the new Emperor and Ocato while they made their way to the &lt;a href=\"Temple%20of%20the%20One\"&gt;Temple of the One&lt;/a&gt;. At the &lt;a href=\"Temple%20District\"&gt;Temple District&lt;/a&gt;, three Oblivion Gates had opened, and &lt;a href=\"Mehrunes%20Dagon\"&gt;Mehrunes Dagon&lt;/a&gt; himself had crossed over to Tamriel in an attempt to come out as the victor. While Legion soldiers were trying to defeat the Daedra as they came out of the gates, and tried to distract the Daedric Prince of Destruction, Martin and the Hero of Kvatch rushed into the Temple of the One. Martin had realized that Dagon had destroyed the Covenant with &lt;a href=\"Akatosh\"&gt;Akatosh&lt;/a&gt; by entering Tamriel, when the Hero mentioned the Amulet of Kings, which gave Martin an idea. By smashing the Amulet of Kings, Martin became an Avatar of Akatosh, and battled Dagon. Upon being victorious, the Dragon turned into stone, and the Gates from Oblivion were sealed forever.\nThe Legions had also largely stopped with their attempts to stop the skooma trade. The skooma trade had become rather great in the city of Bravil, with a number of citizens dedicating entire days consuming the drug. Some action was taken to stopping a skooma dealer, named &lt;a href=\"Kylius%20Lonavo\"&gt;Kylius Lonavo&lt;/a&gt;, near &lt;a href=\"Leyawiin\"&gt;Leyawiin&lt;/a&gt;, though aside from this not much action was taken against the skooma trade.\nOther deeds of the Legions within Cyrodiil were also recorded. The Legionnaires of the Imperial City arrested the leader of a band of brigands who had captured &lt;a href=\"The%20Bloated%20Float\"&gt;The Bloated Float&lt;/a&gt; and set it out to sea. They also arrested one of the criminals responsible for the raiding of a tax shipment, and got rid of two of the Imperial City guard Captains. Captain Lex, who had led a personal vendetta against the &lt;a href=\"The%20Gray%20Fox%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;Gray Fox&lt;/a&gt; was reassigned to Anvil. Prior to being reassigned, the Captain ordered Legion forces to collect taxes from the Imperial City Waterfront, a district normally not taxed by the Empire. Due to this, the Thieves Guild stole back the taxes and the tax records to give the gold back to the people of the Waterfront. The Guard Captain blamed the Gray Fox, and demanded a bounty be put on his head, but his request was refused by the Legion Commander. Lex also attempted to arrest a member of the Thieves Guild by staging a theft through an informant, only to end up discovering that the Guild discovered who the informant was. Because of this, the stolen item was planted on the informant, resulting in her arrest. One of the final deeds of Lex was calling upon the majority of the guard force within the capital to find and arrest the Gray Fox, resulting in the Waterfront district of the Imperial City being on lockdown. Because of this, other parts of the city were left poorly defended. The Thieves Guild used this opportunity to steal from various locations in the city, including the Arcane University, resulting in Lex having to return the Legion forces he had summoned. Another of the Watch Captains was replaced due to his corruption. Watch Captain &lt;a href=\"Audens%20Avidius\"&gt;Audens Avidius&lt;/a&gt; had been accusing citizens of crimes they did not commit, and demanded fines be paid for them. Two of the people who had to endure the corruption of Avidius testified against his crime, as such, he was arrested by another Guard Captain, named &lt;a href=\"Itius%20Hayn\"&gt;Itius Hayn&lt;/a&gt;. Within the Imperial City, unrest had also broken out between the Attius and Sintav clans, resulting in bloodshed and fighting between the two families. The fighting had gotten so bad that the Watch Captain, alongside the City Watch, had to put a stop to the fighting. The Sintavs accepted, but only because their patriarch, &lt;a href=\"Iniel%20Sintav\"&gt;Iniel Sintav&lt;/a&gt;, told them so.\nWith the Oblivion Crisis ended, the Septim dynasty was gone, but this was only the start of the Empire crumbling. Many of the provinces had become uneasy with the Empire, and after the latest crisis, most decided to abandon it. The counties of &lt;a href=\"Bravil\"&gt;Bravil&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Leyawiin\"&gt;Leyawiin&lt;/a&gt; also seceded.\n&lt;a href=\"Fourth%20Era\"&gt;Fourth Era&lt;/a&gt;.\nAfter the Oblivion Crisis, the Legions were in a rough shape, and the Empire had to deal with the aftermath of the Crisis. These troubles would worsen following the &lt;a href=\"Red%20Year\"&gt;Red Year&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"4E%205\"&gt;4E 5&lt;/a&gt;, during which the &lt;a href=\"Red%20Mountain\"&gt;Red Mountain&lt;/a&gt; erupted in Morrowind and threw Morrowind into chaos. Even within Black Marsh the effects were felt, with the destruction of roads and Imperial garrisons being cut off. In the shock of the Imperial forces of Morrowind and Black Marsh, the Thalmor incited an uprising in Black Marsh. These would push out the Imperials from Argonia, and result in southern Morrowind being conquered by the &lt;a href=\"An-Xileel\"&gt;An-Xileel&lt;/a&gt;.\nFollowing the death of &lt;a href=\"Potentate%20Ocato\"&gt;Potentate Ocato&lt;/a&gt;, the Empire was thrown into shambles, and the &lt;a href=\"Stormcrown%20Interregnum\"&gt;Stormcrown Interregnum&lt;/a&gt; began. During the interregnum years of in-fighting, plots and backstabbing took place, with many people attempting to take the Imperial Throne. In this chaos, the Legions were greatly weakened, an event of which the &lt;a href=\"Thalmor\"&gt;Thalmor&lt;/a&gt; took advantage.\nAfter years of gaining support from the local &lt;a href=\"Altmer\"&gt;Altmer&lt;/a&gt; of the &lt;a href=\"Summerset%20Isles\"&gt;Summerset Isles&lt;/a&gt;, the Thalmor now had chance to take over complete control. With the Empire in chaos, they overthrew the rightful Kings and Queens of the Altmer, following which they purged any who were not \"of the blood of the Aldmer\", which in turn was used as an excuse to kill dissidents.\nThe Interregnum would end in &lt;a href=\"4E%2017\"&gt;4E 17&lt;/a&gt;, at the hands of &lt;a href=\"Titus%20Mede\"&gt;Titus Mede&lt;/a&gt;, a warlord from &lt;a href=\"Colovia\"&gt;Colovia&lt;/a&gt;. The weakness of the Imperial army was apparent at this time, as Mede conquered the Imperial City with under a thousand men. Under the rule of Titus, the Empire was slowly stabilizing, but the Legions were far from ready for battle. Before Titus could respond to warnings of the Thalmor threat, the Thalmor had organized a coup in &lt;a href=\"Valenwood\"&gt;Valenwood&lt;/a&gt;, with Bosmeri allies which they had obtained since before the Oblivion Crisis. The Legion forces within the province outnumbered the Thalmor, but the combined Altmer and Bosmer forces had used grand subterfuge and stratagem, as they waited and watched their enemy, and chose both the location and time of battle. Because of this, their small contingent of Altmer and Bosmer forces were able to take over all the Imperial strongholds in the land. Imperial Generals claimed the Thalmor forces outnumbered their own, but this was incorrect. The Thalmor commanded better spies and their forces had greater mobility, and knew how to best use them. In this the Thalmor showed that they were devious and subtle, as well as patient. With the successful conquering of Valenwood, the Thalmor prevented any potential attempt the Empire could have made at reclaiming the Summerset Isles at the time. Later, during the &lt;a href=\"Night%20of%20Green%20Fire\"&gt;Night of Green Fire&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"4E%2042\"&gt;4E 42&lt;/a&gt;, the Thalmor would hunt down refugees in &lt;a href=\"Sentinel\"&gt;Sentinel&lt;/a&gt;. The Thalmor infiltrated the refugee quarter and attacked the dissidents with magic, while the dissidents themselves resisted with magic of their own. By the time the local Legion forces arrived, the battle was already over, with the quarter in ruins, and the Altmer dissidents being killed.\nFollowing the &lt;a href=\"Void%20Nights\"&gt;Void Nights&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"4E%2098\"&gt;4E 98&lt;/a&gt;, Elsweyr was struck with chaos, as the Moons hold a significant meaning to the Khajiit. After two years, the Moons had returned, and the Thalmor took credit for this, stating they had used previously unknown Dawn Magicks. Years later, Imperial influence had so diminished within Elsweyr, that the Legion could not stop a coup in &lt;a href=\"4E%20115\"&gt;4E 115&lt;/a&gt;, which resulted in the dissolving of the &lt;a href=\"Elsweyr%20Confederacy\"&gt;Elsweyr Confederacy&lt;/a&gt;, and the recreation of the ancient kingdoms of &lt;a href=\"Anequina\"&gt;Anequina&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Pelletine\"&gt;Pelletine&lt;/a&gt; as client states to the Dominion.\n&lt;a href=\"Umbriel%20Crisis\"&gt;Umbriel Crisis&lt;/a&gt;.\nOne of the noteworthy events is the &lt;a href=\"Umbriel%20Crisis\"&gt;Umbriel Crisis&lt;/a&gt;. The Flying City of &lt;a href=\"Umbriel\"&gt;Umbriel&lt;/a&gt; appeared on Tamriel and caused havoc on Tamriel.\nDespite the Emperor's original refusal to admit to &lt;a href=\"Umbriel\"&gt;Umbriel&lt;/a&gt;'s threat to the Empire, he later did send out a research unit of thirty strong to discover the flying city, which had flown towards Morrowind. It was here that one of the researchers, a Nibenese named &lt;a href=\"Brennus\"&gt;Brennus&lt;/a&gt;, discovered that Umbriel was a pocket realm of Oblivion. Shortly after this discovery, the research party was attacked by an army of undead, largely consisting of undead Argonians. The Legionnaires, under the command of Captain Falcus, tried to defend the party by forming a phalanx in a hurry. The undead were organized and said to have been marching, some were also armed with various weapons, spears, swords, maces, clubs, though the majority was unarmed. To avoid the undead army, which was larger than the research unit, the phalanx slowly made their way towards the south.\nThe unit eventually managed to escape from the undead horde, though they did lose around half their men. They had also discovered that the undead army that attacked them was not the only undead army, as more undead were entering &lt;a href=\"County%20Cheydinhal\"&gt;County Cheydinhal&lt;/a&gt; from Morrowind. The Legionnaires arrived at &lt;a href=\"Mountain%20Watch\"&gt;Mountain Watch&lt;/a&gt;, where they searched the homes of the people. Shortly afterwards, Captain Falcus commanded the townsfolk to pack items which were needed for survival, such as food, drink, weapons and horses, and regroup for a march towards &lt;a href=\"Cheydinhal\"&gt;Cheydinhal&lt;/a&gt;. The villagers gathered their most needed belongings, including six horses, one of which was given to Kuur, the Legion Battlemage, and another was given to Falcus.\nAfter a day of travel, Cheydinhal's &lt;a href=\"The%20Great%20Chapel%20of%20Arkay\"&gt;Chapel of Arkay&lt;/a&gt; became visible, but the scouts of the escort discovered the undead force had been advancing and was threatening to stop their journey towards the city. In order to make it to the city in time, Captain Falcus ordered the refugees and his troops to drop anything they did not need in order to reach the city in time. The two wagons were also left behind, and the elderly were put on the four horses that used to carry the wagons forward. Though the refugees were now advancing faster, the undead army also approached them in a rough phalanx from their left flank. As the undead came closer, many of the refugees started to flee and cry, five soldiers cut off from their run to encircle the escort in order to defend it, including the Legion Battlemage, who defended their rear end. Cheydinhal had managed to prepare for the undead, and the gate the refugees were approaching, while open, was guarded by fifty of Cheydinhal's guardsmen.\nAfter safely entering the city, Captain Falcus ordered his men and refugees to eat and rest, to which his Legionnaires gladly agreed, and within an hour of arrival in the city, an encampment had been created near &lt;a href=\"Castle%20Cheydinhal\"&gt;Castle Cheydinhal&lt;/a&gt;. The undead had no siege equipment, and Cheydinhal itself had its own soldiers, alongside a mixed company of Legion units, but the undead army was still a threat. It had assembled itself outside the city gates, just outside of ballista and catapult range. Meanwhile, within the city, people who had recently died came back to life and had to be put down by the City Watch.\nNot long afterwards, a battle would take place. The Cheydinhal Guard and Legion forces together charged the undead army, successfully breaking through their line. Unfortunately, on either side of the outer gate leading out of the city the undead had also set up lines. Breaking through the lines took hours, and the undead did not rest, waver, or regroup, instead only advancing wave after wave. When their line had been broken through, Falcus ordered his troops to regroup on the &lt;a href=\"Blue%20Road\"&gt;Blue Road&lt;/a&gt;, before being killed by a spear through the throat. Brennus and &lt;a href=\"Mazgar%20gra%20Yagash\"&gt;Mazgar gra Yagash&lt;/a&gt; got separated from the group in the chaos, though they did manage to give the refugees a head start. The following day, the two were spotted by an undead force and hid inside a building, where they got aid from the &lt;a href=\"Knights%20of%20the%20Thorn\"&gt;Knights of the Thorn&lt;/a&gt;.\nSome time later, the refugees were reunited with Brennus and Mazgar, the Legionnaires now being led by Captain Arges. The refugee force was now split in two in order to lessen the casualties in the event the undead were to attack. The Knights of the Thorn had also concluded that Cheydinhal was secure again, and a number of refugees thought it wiser to return to the city rather than continue their march to the Imperial City. However, Captain Arges insisted the Legionnaires continued on to the capital, and the refugees were unwilling to return without protection, so they stuck with the Legion soldiers. While on the road, another Legion force was encountered, commanded by Commander Prossos, who took command over the refugees and gave Mazgar a field promotion to captain. Prossos made clear that &lt;a href=\"General%20Takar\"&gt;General Takar&lt;/a&gt; was aiming to attack the undead west of the Blue Road, and tasked Mazgar with getting the refugees out of the combat area.\nThe General had around 5000 men with him, a proper Legion. His forces primarily consisted of mounted infantry and mages, and were formed up on a large field. There were also eight wagons, which were presumed siege engines. After an hour of waiting Umbriel came close to the legion, and unlike with the previous attacks, the undead were now walking directly underneath the flying city. Part of the Legionnaires charged the undead army, while over half of the legion alongside the wagons were cast levitation magic on by members of &lt;a href=\"Synod\"&gt;Synod&lt;/a&gt; to reach the flying city. These levitating units were met with forces of Umbriel in the sky, which killed them all before they could set foot on the flying island. Only one of the wagons came close to the rim of the island, but never made it to the top. The Synod tried other kinds of magic, according to some over a hundred, though to no avail, and after less than an hour of fighting General Takar's men used a war horn to signal a retreat, what remained of his forces fell back. Umbriel moved on as if nothing had happened.\nThe following two days, the refugees kept marching out of harm's way, though many retreated to Cheydinhal. Commander Prossos officially gave Mazgar the authority over the refugee group, as he intended to go to the Imperial City to reinforce it. Mazgar originally pleaded for the Commander to also take her with him, and Prossos originally agreed. However, Brennus insisted Mazgar remained with him, as the Imperial war office had assigned her as his bodyguard. Prossos acknowledged that these orders could not be countered in the field, to which Brennus insisted he had to come along too.\nThese forces would eventually reach &lt;a href=\"Lake%20Rumare\"&gt;Lake Rumare&lt;/a&gt;, where they would use rowboats to row to the &lt;a href=\"City%20Isle\"&gt;City Isle&lt;/a&gt; from the north, where they would meet a large force and push towards the northwest part of the capital, as the enemy had put most of its forces there and attempted to break through the gate to the Imperial Prison. It was also the direction from which Umbriel approached. Five hundred troops were assigned to this task. While rowing, the Legionnaires were shot at by archers, and underwater the undead tried to capsize the boats. The soldiers on Brennus' and Mazgar's boat quickly recovered and formed a Diamond Formation around Brennus while pushing toward the shore. By the time the soldiers had made it to the shore, the survivors of the first two waves of boats had formed a double line on the shore, one facing the enemy from the sea, while the other looked landward. Of the five hundred, only around two to three hundred survived the landing and had to fight against an undead army two to three times their size, though the Legionnaires did advance successfully. During the advance, the soldiers formed a wedge formation to prevent the undead from outflanking them. They then advanced in a bloody pace, and the entire cohort eventually started singing a song called \"General Slaughter's Comely Daughter.\"\nThe cohort was followed by a unit in a phalanx formation. The Legion forces in the Imperial City had also attempted two assaults on the flying city through levitation magic, though both were just as unsuccessful as General Takar's attempt. Some faith was put into the &lt;a href=\"College%20of%20Whispers\"&gt;College of Whispers&lt;/a&gt; and the Synod, however, which had manned the city walls and would give the assault all they had. They had also been given plenty of time to set up defenses.\nA few hours from sundown, Commander Prossos' men had met up with what remained of the &lt;a href=\"Twelfth%20Legion\"&gt;Twelfth Legion&lt;/a&gt;, after which they together pushed the undead army against the wall. They also cleared the gate and set up defenses to protect it from another siege. The western flank was originally quiet, but this would change when a large undead force rose from the west, which pushed what remained of the Legion cavalry before them. Other undead came from the east and from Lake Rumare, and all of them aimed for the Prison district, as that was where Umbriel was flying towards. In order to halt the advance, the Imperial Cavalry cut them back a small distance, but the Legion truly needed their spearmen, which were still located at the city gate where the main offense had been mere moments prior. The left flank of the Legion forces was taken down, but rather than attempt to overwhelm the remaining Legionnaires, the undead rushed towards the wall in an attempt to make a ladder from their own bodies. The undead kept doing so until Umbriel was destroyed, and the undead became dead again.\nThe credit for stopping the flying city was granted to the Synod and the College of Whispers by &lt;a href=\"Attrebus%20Mede\"&gt;Attrebus Mede&lt;/a&gt;, who told his father, &lt;a href=\"Titus%20Mede%20I\"&gt;Titus Mede I&lt;/a&gt; that he needed the support of the Elder Council, and that for that support he needed the support of the Synod and the College of Whispers. He also said that, where there typically was rivalry between the two factions, here they had claimed to work together. Attrebus consider it the best for the Empire, and so his father agreed to give credit to the Synod and the College of Whispers.\nPorcia Loran and the Reachmen of Bthardamz.\nSometime during the Fourth Era, the Breton Spymaster &lt;a href=\"Porcia%20Loran\"&gt;Porcia Loran&lt;/a&gt;, was working with Legion forces in Skyrim to halt a clan of Reachmen invaders. She was directly commanding a Breton phalanx. Her past apprentice, Talym Rend, would however be forced to sabotage her attempts at the command of &lt;a href=\"Sheogorath\"&gt;Sheogorath&lt;/a&gt;. Talym would ambush a Reachmen courier, and gather their intelligence. The intelligence carried by the courier turned out to be the news of a new deadly poison gas developed by the Reachmen, and the Reachmen were planning to attach the gas to Dwemer &lt;a href=\"Animunculi\"&gt;Animunculi&lt;/a&gt; and send them into battle. &lt;a href=\"Cyriel\"&gt;Cyriel&lt;/a&gt;, Talym's Companion, informed Talym of this, and insisted Talym should inform the Legion of this information, but Talym refused, resulting in Cyriel abandoning Talym.\nTalym would instead plant fake intel to trick Porcia, however, while doing so, Talym had activated a number of traps, which put the Reachmen on high alert. This resulted in Porcia being captured by the Reachmen force. As such, Talym had to save her from the Reachmen. Porcia would still find the fake intel, however, which directed her towards a Shrine of Mara due to the sacred flowers which grew there.\nAt the grove, however, the local priests refused to grant the flowers to the Legion, resulting in Porcia assaulting the shrine and taking the flowers by force.\nAfter successfully obtaining the flowers, the Legion alchemists refined them into a gas which would negate the poison according to the intel. However, due to the limited supply the Legion had, the situation had to be contained. As such, it was decided to use a passage into Bthardamz, of which the Reachmen were aware. The plan was to march the bulk of the Imperial forces inside the passage, and wait until the poison would be released before the antidote would be used. The antidote was, however, not an antidote for the poison. Rather than cure its effects, the antidote caused large explosions, killing most of the Reachmen along with the Breton Legionnaires. While technically the assault was a success, the massacre and the murder of the priests resulted in Porcia retiring from the Legion, being too afraid to ever give another command, or share another secret which could hurt someone.\n&lt;a href=\"Great%20War\"&gt;Great War&lt;/a&gt;.\nIn &lt;a href=\"4E%20171\"&gt;4E 171&lt;/a&gt;, the Legion was greatly weakened as a result of the many wars it had to endure in a recent timeframe, the &lt;a href=\"Aldmeri%20Dominion%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Aldmeri Dominion&lt;/a&gt; used this opportunity, and attacked the Empire in what is known as the &lt;a href=\"Great%20War\"&gt;Great War&lt;/a&gt;. With the Legions in a weak state, and the Empire unprepared for the vicious Aldmeri assault, the Legion suffered heavy casualties.\nThe Aldmeri armies would be commanded by &lt;a href=\"Lord%20Naarifin\"&gt;Lord Naarifin&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Lady%20Arannelya\"&gt;Lady Arannelya&lt;/a&gt;, with the former focusing his forces on the Cyrodiil front, while the latter focused hers on the Hammerfell front. Naarifin would advance from southern Cyrodiil, and defeat the Imperial defenses along the Valenwood border, allowing Lady Arannelya to advance into western Cyrodiil. At the same time, other parts Naarifin's army conquered Leyawiin and cut off Bravil. Lady Arranelya would cross through western Cyrodiil and into Hammerfell. Combined with smaller Aldmeri landings in southern Hammerfell, most of its coastline was quickly overrun by the Dominion, and the local Imperial Legion, alongside scattered Redguard forces, had to fall back to the &lt;a href=\"Alik%27r%20Desert\"&gt;Alik'r Desert&lt;/a&gt; in the north in the &lt;a href=\"March%20of%20Thirst\"&gt;March of Thirst&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe following year, Lord Naarifin advanced deeper into Cyrodiil, conquering both Bravil and Anvil and eventually coming to the walls of the Imperial City at the end of the year. The Imperial Legion and Imperial Navy tried their best to fight against Dominion forces in &lt;a href=\"Lake%20Rumare\"&gt;Lake Rumare&lt;/a&gt; and along the &lt;a href=\"Niben\"&gt;Niben&lt;/a&gt; as they attempted to hold on to the eastern bank of the capital. In Hammerfell, Lady Arranelya conquered the entire southern coastline, excluding the city of &lt;a href=\"Hegathe\"&gt;Hegathe&lt;/a&gt;. This effectively provided the Dominion with the territory of Hammerfell they had originally demanded in the ultimatum they had provided to the Emperor. The Legion would gain some positive news, as the March of Thirst had come to an end as the Legion forces had regrouped in northern Hammerfell, joined by Legions from High Rock.\nIn 4E 173, the Legions in Cyrodiil were starting to be more effective at fighting the Aldmeri troops, but the relentless advance of the Dominion continued. Fresh Legion reinforcements came from Skyrim to bolster the main army of the Legion in the Imperial City, but the Dominion continued their advance, and crossed the Niben and advancing on the eastern bank of the Imperial City. Within Hammerfell, the Dominion suffered a defeat, as their siege on the Crown city of Hegathe was broken by a Forebear army from Sentinel. Despite this, the Dominion army within the province still crossed the Alik'r Desert, until meeting the Imperial Legions under &lt;a href=\"General%20Decianus\"&gt;General Decianus&lt;/a&gt; outside &lt;a href=\"Skaven\"&gt;Skaven&lt;/a&gt; where a bloody and indecisive clash took place. Decianus would eventually withdraw his forces, providing the Dominion with a pyrrhic victory. Skaven had fallen to Aldmeri rule, but at such a cost of Aldmeri forces, that the army of Lady Arranelya was too weak to continue their advance. At the end of the year the Imperial City was surrounded, with only the northern supply route to &lt;a href=\"Bruma\"&gt;Bruma&lt;/a&gt; remaining intact.\n4E 174 marked the year of the Aldmeri campaign for the White-Gold Tower, and is the same year in which &lt;a href=\"Ulfric%20Stormcloak\"&gt;Ulfric Stormcloak&lt;/a&gt; was captured by Thalmor forces and interrogated. The Thalmor ordered all their available forces to make way to the Imperial City, in hopes of ending the Great War once and for all. Aldmeri reinforcements gathered in southern Cyrodiil, and on the 12th of &lt;a href=\"Second%20Seed\"&gt;Second Seed&lt;/a&gt;, the Dominion launched an assault on the Imperial City. One of the Aldmeri armies advanced to the north of the city, while the main army was commanded by Lord Naarifin himself, and would surround the rest of the Imperial capital. Titus Mede II would break out of the city with part of his army, and cut through the Aldmeri forces advancing from the north, following which he linked up with the Legions from Skyrim under &lt;a href=\"General%20Jonna\"&gt;General Jonna&lt;/a&gt;, which had started moving south. The Imperial City itself would be defended by the &lt;a href=\"Eighth%20Legion\"&gt;Eighth Legion&lt;/a&gt;, which fought a desperate rearguard action on the city walls. The Dominion would end up victorious, and started with an event known as the Sack of the Imperial City. The Imperial Palace was burned, the White-Gold Tower was looted, and the High Elves mistreated the local population. Lord Naarifin had started with his plans sacrifice the entire population of the Imperial City, as part of a prophecy known as &lt;a href=\"The%20Culling\"&gt;The Culling&lt;/a&gt;, which would result in the unleashing of hordes of Daedra.\nThe Legions in Hammerfell were preparing to take back Skaven, when General Decianus was recalled to Cyrodiil. Decianus, however, refused to abandon Hammerfell completely, and allowed a great number of Legionnaires to be discharged from the army. As a result, the Thalmor were unaware that Decianus had left Hammerfell, due to the large number of Legion veterans that remained in the province. These veterans would form up with the Alik'r Warriors, and their combined forces would push the Aldmeri army out of Skaven and back across the Alik'r Desert in late-4E 174, resulting in many losses for the Aldmeri army under Lady Arranelya.\nIn the winter season, the Thalmor believed that the war in Cyrodiil was over, and several attempts were made to contact the Emperor. The Emperor convinced the Thalmor he was preparing to surrender, while at the same time gathering his forces to prepare to retake the capital. At the time, however, morale in the Legions was so low that when the Emperor regrouped in Skyrim, groups of Nordic deserters abandoned the Legion, thinking it was doomed. When the Emperor learned of Lord Naarifin's plans regarding the Culling, the Emperor was terrified, but knew a direct attack on the Imperial City was doomed to fail, as the Dominion could predict his every move. &lt;a href=\"The%20Forgotten%20Hero\"&gt;The Forgotten Hero&lt;/a&gt; volunteered to infiltrate the Imperial City to find out the source of Naarifin's power. While the city was heavily guarded, Lord Naarifin had reopened the Arena, and the Hero, alongside his companions, posed as a gladiator to gain entry. The Hero eventually infiltrated the White-Gold Tower through a secret tunnel system, and entered Lord Naarifin's library, where &lt;a href=\"Laaneth\"&gt;Laaneth&lt;/a&gt; discovered the source of Naarifin's power, the &lt;a href=\"Orb%20of%20Vaermina\"&gt;Orb of Vaermina&lt;/a&gt;.\nUpon return at the Emperor's camp, the &lt;a href=\"Imperial%20Guard%20Division\"&gt;Imperial Guard Division&lt;/a&gt;, tasked with defending the Emperor had been assassinated by &lt;a href=\"Bosmer\"&gt;Bosmer&lt;/a&gt; assassins under employ by the Thalmor. While the assassins were defeated before they could kill the Emperor, they did injure the Emperor. Because of this, the Emperor was in no shape to lead the assault, but the Emperor, aware of the low morale in the Legion, knew that the Legions needed to believe the Emperor was strong. As such, he trusted the Forgotten Hero to lead the assault in his stead, leaving the fate of the Empire in their hands. Some Nords were convinced that the Imperial losses would be severe, and were proven right at the end of the war. Through prayer to Talos and a vision, some men became encouraged, and were more willing to fight.\nWithout the Orb to spy on the Imperial forces, a counterattack was planned, known as the &lt;a href=\"Battle%20of%20the%20Red%20Ring\"&gt;Battle of the Red Ring&lt;/a&gt;. The Imperial forces were split into three, General Decianus and his Legions from Hammerfell hid in the Colovian Highlands near Chorrol, General Jonna and her, primarily Nord, Legions from Skyrim took position near Cheydinhal, while the main army would advance from the north, leading the main assault. General Decianus caught the Dominion off guard due to the many veterans he had left behind in Hammerfell, which had convinced Lady Arranelya she still faced the Imperial army there. On the 30th of &lt;a href=\"Rain%27s%20Hand\"&gt;Rain's Hand&lt;/a&gt;, Decianus attacked with a surprise attack from the west, while General Jonna attacked from Cheydinhal. In an assault lasting two days, Jonna's Legions crossed the Niben and advanced to the west in an attempt to link up with the forces commanded by General Decianus, and effectively surround the Imperial City. The forces of General Decianus advanced with ease due to the element of surprise, but the Legions commanded by General Jonna faced bitter resistance from a Dominion counterattack from Skingrad and Bravil. The Nord Legions fought off the piecemeal Aldmeri attacks, and after five days, the main Aldmeri army in Cyrodiil was completely surrounded in the Imperial City.\nDespite the best attempts of the Altmer soldiers within the city, the Imperial assault from the north broke through the city gates, and the Legion forces advanced as quickly as they could in search of Naarifin to prevent the completion of the Culling. The success of the Imperial, Redguard, and Breton Legionnaires caused what remained of the Aldmeri army to attempt to break out of the city to the south, only to be met by the shieldwall of the Nord Legions of General Jonna. Naarifin had gotten very close to completion of the prophecy, but was eventually beaten by the Forgotten Hero. Following the victory, the people of Cyrodiil saw Titus Mede II as their hero, not knowing it really was the Forgotten Hero who had lead the assault. The Hero quietly left the city afterwards, while the Emperor kept Naarifin alive for thirty-three days in a cage hanging from the White-Gold Tower. Whether his body was buried or not, and where, is unknown. One source claims his body was carried off by winged daedra on the thirty-fourth day.\nAt the end of the war, every Legion was gathered in Cyrodiil. Despite being victorious, they were in no shape to keep the war going, being too exhausted and decimated after the Battle of the Red Ring. Not one Legion had more than half of its forces left fit for duty, with three entire Legions being entirely destroyed. The Emperor knew that there was no better time to negotiate for peace, and so agreed to the terms of the &lt;a href=\"White-Gold%20Concordat\"&gt;White-Gold Concordat&lt;/a&gt;, believing it was necessary to secure peace and provide the Empire a chance to rebuild its strength. Where as the terms were similar to the original ultimatum, most of the Empire welcomed peace at any price at the end of the war. Hammerfell refused to accept the Concordat, and was renounced as an Imperial province, which was seen by the Redguards as a betrayal. After five additional years of fighting, the Redguards fought the Dominion to a standstill, and signed the &lt;a href=\"Second%20Treaty%20of%20Stros%20M%27kai\"&gt;Second Treaty of Stros M'kai&lt;/a&gt;, following which the Dominion chose to withdraw from Hammerfell. The Redguards claim this proves that the Dominion could have been defeated by the combined forces of the Empire and Hammerfell. A similar claim is recognized, as Hammerfell and the Empire need one another to stand against the Thalmor threat, as otherwise Tamriel is doomed to the Dominion. \nHad Great War continued, however, the Empire would have been slaughtered. The Concordat was the only way for the Empire to survive, a claim supported by members of the Legion and Blades alike. The Concordat was meant to buy the Empire time to recover before the next war with the Dominion takes place.\n&lt;a href=\"Skyrim%20Civil%20War\"&gt;Skyrim Civil War&lt;/a&gt;.\nSeveral years after the Great War, the Legions had garrisons throughout all the provinces of the Empire. The garrison stationed in Skyrim would be used in an attempt to stop the &lt;a href=\"Stormcloak%20Rebellion\"&gt;Stormcloak Rebellion&lt;/a&gt; and end the Civil War. Most of the officers serving in the Legion of Skyrim are from Cyrodiil, as such, they had been provided with a Field Officer's guide to the Holds within the land. These officers were advised to always keep a secure supply line back to Haafingar, from where General Tullius commands all the Legions within the province. Within Castle Dour, the Legion kept ample supplies for their campaigns. The Legion forces within the province consists of various people of Skyrim. Many Nords, Redguards, Bretons, and Imperials make up its ranks. Some Dunmer are also part of the ranks of the Legion, with numerous Dunmer farmers signing on with the Legion due to how they have been treated by the Nords. A combination of fresh recruits and Hold Guards make up the Imperial army within Skyrim, trained at Castle Dour by &lt;a href=\"Captain%20Aldis\"&gt;Captain Aldis&lt;/a&gt;, who is Haafingar's Guard Captain. &lt;a href=\"Legate%20Fasendil\"&gt;Legate Fasendil&lt;/a&gt;, the Imperial Legate of &lt;a href=\"The%20Rift%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;the Rift&lt;/a&gt; was put in Skyrim due to his knowledge of the Thalmor, as he was present during the &lt;a href=\"Night%20of%20Green%20Fire\"&gt;Night of Green Fire&lt;/a&gt;. The Legate assumes the Thalmor are behind the unrest in Skyrim, and is proven right by the . Why people sign on with the Legion in Skyrim varies. Some join the Legion to see the world, others due to relatives having served in the Legion, or because they could not stand watching Ulfric tear everything apart and not do something, though often times their families disagree with their choice.\nThe Imperial Army within the province consists of various forces. Soldiers include phalanx pikemen, troopers, but the majority of the Imperial army consists of locally recruited militia consisting of, scouts and skirmishers. Only few reinforcements have been provided to the Legion in Skyrim, forcing them to recruit locally. This was because the Empire focused the majority of its forces on the border with the Aldmeri Dominion. Within Cyrodiil, the Civil War in Skyrim was seen as a sideshow, an interlude before the main event with the Dominion resumes.\nEven so, some Imperial reinforcements are being recruited within Cyrodiil, awaiting an opportunity for &lt;a href=\"Pale%20Pass\"&gt;Pale Pass&lt;/a&gt; to clear from avalanches, to aid the Imperial army within Skyrim. Another Imperial Legion could be called from Cyrodiil at the command of &lt;a href=\"Maven%20Black-Briar\"&gt;Maven Black-Briar&lt;/a&gt; due to her influence in the Empire, which would arrive in the Rift within a fortnight.\nAs of 4E 201, the Legion holds 4 Holds (&lt;a href=\"Haafingar\"&gt;Haafingar&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Hjaalmarch\"&gt;Hjaalmarch&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Falkreath%20Hold\"&gt;Falkreath Hold&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"The%20Reach\"&gt;The Reach&lt;/a&gt;) under full Imperial control, with Whiterun being marked as \"Imperial\" but being neutral. When General Tullius was sent to Skyrim in &lt;a href=\"4E%20201\"&gt;4E 201&lt;/a&gt;, he turned things around for the Empire. Under his leadership the Legion started massacring the Stormcloaks and slowly pushing them back. Tullius managed to capture Ulfric Stormcloak at &lt;a href=\"Darkwater%20Crossing\"&gt;Darkwater Crossing&lt;/a&gt; in an ambush, after which Ulfric was scheduled for execution at Helgen. However, due to Alduin returning, Ulfric managed to escape. The Legion is currently stationing soldiers in the Rift, threatening Ulfric's southern flank, and attempting to conquer Winterhold, so that Ulfric's forces have to stay at Windhelm.\nThe Legion lost certain forts they had occupied. &lt;a href=\"Fort%20Dunstad\"&gt;Fort Dunstad&lt;/a&gt; was taken from Imperial control by bandits, &lt;a href=\"Fort%20Neugrad\"&gt;Fort Neugrad&lt;/a&gt; was lost following the attack on Helgen, and &lt;a href=\"Fort%20Greymoor\"&gt;Fort Greymoor&lt;/a&gt; swept hands between Imperial, Stormcloak, and brigand rule throughout the war. The Legion did, however, successfully take over &lt;a href=\"Fort%20Hraggstad\"&gt;Fort Hraggstad&lt;/a&gt;.\nAs the war continued, Ulfric had established plans of invading Whiterun, which were discovered by Legion Scouts, while Ulfric himself was willing to give Jarl Balgruuf one last chance to join his cause, or be considered an enemy of the Stormcloaks. Even so, Stormcloak Assassins were sent out in attempts to assassinate the Jarl. With Ulfric and Balgruuf being at odds for years, Ulfric's plans for invading, and mutual advantage of siding with the Empire, Balgruuf ends up accepting Imperial aid, and their combined forces fought against the Stormcloaks during the &lt;a href=\"Battle%20for%20Whiterun\"&gt;Battle for Whiterun&lt;/a&gt;.\nDuties.\nIntended as the sole militaristic force behind Cyrodiil's seat of power, the Legion operates in conjunction with the &lt;a href=\"Imperial%20City\"&gt;Imperial City&lt;/a&gt;'s police-force, the &lt;a href=\"Imperial%20Watch\"&gt;Imperial Watch&lt;/a&gt;. Their headquarters are situated in the Imperial City. The duties of a Legionnaire are first to the Empire, and then to their commanding officers. Legionnaires are expected to behave with dignity and uphold the law, as they are the face of the Empire. Theft and assault are considered treason among the Legion, and result in the Legionnaire having to speak to their recruiting officer regarding their status. If a Legionnaire accuses a superior officer of murder without sufficient evidence, their recruiting officer has the right to press charges of insubordination. If evidence is presented, the recruiting officer provides it to his superiors in Cyrodiil. The primary duties of the Legion are to serve the Emperor, uphold the law, and protect the citizenry.\nThe Legion is the primary fighting force of the &lt;a href=\"Empires\"&gt;Cyrodilic Empires&lt;/a&gt;, Cyrodilic &lt;a href=\"cities\"&gt;cities&lt;/a&gt; and towns most often have City Guards, while Nordic cities and towns have &lt;a href=\"Hold%20Guard\"&gt;Hold Guard&lt;/a&gt;s, which are Legion soldiers serving the counties and Holds for police duties and law enforcement in the Imperial provinces. Imperial Soldiers also patrol the roads of the Imperial provinces, protect nobles and researchers, collect taxes, and are allowed to seize property of arrested criminals. Legionnaires are normally not authorized to search homes, only being allowed to do so during wartime or at the order of the Emperor. Under normal circumstances the Imperial City has at least one Legion stationed within.\nTraining.\nThe Legion looks for upstanding citizens who show superior endurance, soldierly virtue, and a trustworthy personality. A Legion soldier is supposed to be a model of the duties of Imperial citizenship.\nTo be able to join the Legion each soldier must be trained and become proficient in the skills of &lt;a href=\"Long%20Blade\"&gt;Long Blade&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Spear\"&gt;Spear&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Blunt%20Weapon\"&gt;Blunt Weapon&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Block\"&gt;Block&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Heavy%20armor\"&gt;Heavy armor&lt;/a&gt;. Imperial soldiers must be able to block quickly and move quickly while in heavy armor. Soldiers are also trained to be able to march long distances with heavy packs and to perform the complex maneuvers that soldiers will perform in real battle. Furthermore, knights are trained to be able to block blows with just their heavy armor, no shield. Imperial Smiths often rely on books to master their trade.\nIf the &lt;a href=\"Nerevarine\"&gt;Nerevarine&lt;/a&gt; or the &lt;a href=\"Last%20Dragonborn\"&gt;Last Dragonborn&lt;/a&gt; join the Legion neither of them have to undergo any type of training. Although, in both cases, the Legion was in desperate need of new soldiers.\nOath.\nNew recruits must take the oath binding them to the service of the &lt;a href=\"Emperor\"&gt;Emperor&lt;/a&gt; and the Legion:\n\"Upon my honor I do swear undying loyalty to the Emperor...\nand unwavering obedience to the officers of his great Empire.\nMay those above judge me, and those below take me, if I fail in my duty.\nLong live the Emperor! Long live the Empire!\"\nBattle organization and ranking.\nDuring the time of the Reman Empire, the Legions became restructured as a result of Akaviri influences. The Akaviri slaves, following their failed invasion, played a major role in the training of the Imperial Army. Under Akaviri guidance, the Legions learned an unparalleled measure of coherence, logistics, and discipline, with which they easily overwhelmed the other armies of Tamriel. Daikatanas and Dragonscale Armor were high crafts from Akavir, much like the banners and military gear of the Third Empire's shock troops, the Blades. The Red Dragons which represent the Empire and the Imperial City were inspired by the Red Dragons which the Akaviri used as war mounts.\nThe Legion fights only on land. Maritime operations are carried out by the &lt;a href=\"Imperial%20Navy\"&gt;Imperial Navy&lt;/a&gt;. To better defend against &lt;a href=\"magic\"&gt;magic&lt;/a&gt;-using foes, the Empire employed the use of Imperial Battlemages, these battlemages form the Shadow Legion. The Legion also makes use of the Phalanx formation, Diamond Formation, Wedge Formation and Shield Walls. The Legions also make use of wardogs, known as Mastiffs. They further are mighty warriors, no one can defeat them when they march in rows in open fields, however, in the &lt;a href=\"Ashlands\"&gt;Ashlands&lt;/a&gt; and the wilderness, the &lt;a href=\"Dunmer\"&gt;Dunmer&lt;/a&gt; are able to defeat them. While at war, the Legions do not listen to politicians in regards to battle tactics, instead listening to their own council to win wars.\nSome sources suggest the fighting strength of the Imperial Legion: \"The Infernal City\" mentions that a Legion numbers 5,000 Legionnaires, and given the highest Legion mentioned is the 18th Legion, then the Imperial Legion has at least 115,000 troops when at full strength. Each Legion is further subdivided into cohorts, which are given orders by centurions, and maniples, which are given orders by legates. Since the Second Era, every cohort includes a cadre of Imperial Battlemages.\nDue to the Legion's limited supplies in the field, legion soldiers are tasked to requisition anything they can find. Imperial soldiers have the right to search containers for provisioning items or equipment, but are advised to use discretion and limit what they take, as taking too much would be able to leave a mark on the people who have their food items taken. Soldiers are also advised to pick up on local recipes, so long as they are simple, while gathering supplies. The needs of the Legionnaires differs on their duty, scouts and skirmishers being best fed with roast goat, mages being best fed capon noodle soup, and infantry being best fed with trotter pie. Legion soldiers are also advised to never keep more than one flask of a fine brew with them. Often before a battle or a parade review, Legion soldiers need a bit of courage, which is often provided through alcohol.\nThe Legions are made up of most of the races of Tamriel. The majority of the Legion is made up of Imperials, who, while individually weak, are one of the strongest peoples when united due to their discipline and training. The majority of the Imperials serving in the Legions are Colovians, who are eager to fight for the Empire if a strong Emperor is in place. The Colovians often take positions of officers in the Legion and Navy, and are often put in place as governors due to their loyalty to the Emperor. Most Colovians serve the Legion as normal soldiers.\nFollowing the &lt;a href=\"Warp%20in%20the%20West\"&gt;Warp in the West&lt;/a&gt;, many Orcs signed on with the Legion at the request of the Emperor. Because of their service within the Legions, the Orcs gained Imperial citizenship. Due to orc warriors in heavy armor being some of the best front-line troops of Tamriel the Legion often employs them in their armies. Many Orcs leave the Orcish Strongholds to join the Legion and see the world. The Legions, likewise, welcome the Orcs due to their skill in battle and smithing. Within the Legions themselves, Orcs master their trade for smithing through practice.\nMany Nords also sign up to join the Legion, due to promises of wealth and glory. Many Nords also sign on due to the protection and prosperity that the Empire offers, feeling the need to compensate by ensuring the people of Cyrodiil that their northern border is protected by some of the fiercest warriors of Tamriel.\nDespite being the most naturally talented warriors of Tamriel, only few Redguards are part of the Legion. This is due to their lack of discipline and a lack of respect for authority. Bosmer likewise see little action within the Legion, as their numbers are low. This is a result of their lack of discipline and because the Bosmer were prone to desertion.\nSoldiers.\nThe Legion uses a variety of soldiers, which consist of the following units, light and heavy cavalry, heavily armored knights, berserkers, skirmishers, archers, scouts, pikemen, troopers and foot knights. The Legion also uses Battlemages, artillery, and levies. As well as rams. During the Third Era, Imperial Battlemages also used Dragons, but it is unknown if the Legion still has any Dragons remaining.\nOfficers.\nCommander.\nThe highest achievable rank, appointed by the Emperor/Empress. This rank commands every officer and legionnaire in the Imperial legion. There can only be one Commander at a time.\nGeneral.\nOne of the highest achievable ranks in the legion. Generals carry out the duties assigned to them by stated ranks. Under normal circumstances, a General commands one Legion, however, a General is also able to command several Legions at a time. They take orders directly from the Emperor but they can also defy these orders. A general can attend elder council meetings.\nAide-de-camp.\nAids to generals \nCaptain.\nCaptains are the commanding officers of town garrisons, and train recruits. They are superiors to Legion Lieutenants, and answer to Legion Centurions.\nLegate.\nHigh-ranking legates serve as the right hand to the generals and fort commanders of the Imperial Legion, directly carrying out tasks and duties presented by these superiors. Although acting as an extra set of hands in some cases, they primarily command maniples of a Legion, allowing for battlefield versatility and more efficient command of lower-ranking soldiers and officers. Legates can also command whole legions. \nTribune.\nOfficers below legates and above praefects.\nPraefect.\nThey serve below tribunes.\nLieutenant.\nLieutenants are tasked with commanding larger groups of soldiers and answer to Legion captains.\nField Officers.\nCenturion.\nImperial Centurions are in charge of the Palace Guard in the Imperial City. They also command Imperial cohorts in a Legion.\nOptio.\nOptios reports to a legion high command.\nPalace Guards.\nPalace Guards are an honor guard and an elite unit of the Imperial Legion. They are tasked with defending the &lt;a href=\"Imperial%20Palace\"&gt;Imperial Palace&lt;/a&gt;.\nSergeant.\nSergeants command small legion units.\nOther ranks.\nPay master.\nPay masters are responsible for sending monthly severance to families of dead legion members.\nSurgeon.\nSurgeons serve as doctors and field medics in the legion \nPrison guard.\nThey serve as guards in imperial prisons. they can be used as additional support when in need.\nArmor.\nThe Legion uses a variety of materials. Light armor is used for scouts, skirmishers, archers and light cavalry. The most common materials for light armor are fur, leather and chainmail armor, which are readily available throughout the Empire. Mithril, elven and glass are considered rare. Iron armor and weapons are produced in bulk for usage for the Legion, much like Imperial steel and silver.\nHeavy armor is used for the frontline infantry, heavy cavalry, foot knights, pikemen, troopers and officers. The most common materials for heavy armor are iron and steel, with dwarven, orcish, ebony and daedric being rare. The Legion uses many materials for their arms, which are listed from cheapest and least desirable, to most expensive and most desirable: iron, steel, silver, dwarven, elven, glass and daedric. Enchanted weapons and armor are also used by the Legion, but since the &lt;a href=\"Mages%20Guild\"&gt;Mages Guild&lt;/a&gt; was used to enchant armor, it is unknown if the Legion still uses enchanted armor. In the event of a crisis behind enemy lines, Legion Soldiers may sell excess materials to noncombatants. These materials must not have a significant military application. The gold required in this manner must be used to secure swift passage back to the Legion that the soldier belongs to.\nUniforms.\nThe Imperial Legion makes use of various different uniforms. Imperial steel consists of plate armor with chainmail underneath, providing two layers of protection. Imperial iron largely consists of chainmail, though plate is used around the torso. The Legion also makes use of Imperial Orichalc armor, which is a sturdy armor which offers more protection than Imperial steel. For most light armor, the Legion makes use of leather armor, which can also be reinforced with chain. For medium armor, the Legion makes use of chainmail. Imperial Knight Bachelors are provided with &lt;a href=\"Imperial%20Templar%20Armor\"&gt;Imperial Templar Armor&lt;/a&gt;, which is a golden armor. Imperial Legion Officers have two uniforms. One is worn while on the field, while the other is worn during other occasions.\nSince the days of Reman, the Legion also makes use of Dragonscale armor. During the late-Third Era on Vvardenfell, three pieces of armor in this style could be found. The &lt;a href=\"Imperial%20Dragonscale%20Cuirass\"&gt;Imperial Dragonscale Cuirass&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Imperial%20Dragonscale%20Helm\"&gt;Imperial Dragonscale Helm&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Dragonscale%20Tower%20Shield\"&gt;Dragonscale Tower Shield&lt;/a&gt;.\nDuring the Second Era, Imperial armor always had an elegant undercloth for the soldier to use. Silks were also used, but these were preferred by mages due to their cost. The leather and steel used by the Legion was often reworked by the citizens of the Empire, resulting in an improvement of quality. Some pieces of these Imperial armors are still seen on Tamriel, namely the horsehair helms with their cheek guards, deep red cloth, and gold clasps, as well as their leather sandals.\nThe armor used by the Legion is different in various of \"The Elder Scrolls\" games:\nUpon retiring from the Imperial Legion, soldiers are allowed to keep their Legion armor.\nWeapons.\nThe Imperial Legion mainly uses the &lt;a href=\"Imperial%20Sword\"&gt;Imperial Sword&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"Steel%20Sword\"&gt;steel swords&lt;/a&gt; for its army, however the Legion also makes use of some other weapons, such as pikes, the commonly used &lt;a href=\"Imperial%20Broadsword\"&gt;Imperial Broadsword&lt;/a&gt;, the standard &lt;a href=\"Imperial%20Shortsword\"&gt;Imperial Shortsword&lt;/a&gt;, spears, claymores and the &lt;a href=\"Imperial%20Bow\"&gt;Imperial Bow&lt;/a&gt;. In , another Imperial styled weapon is wielded by &lt;a href=\"General%20Falx%20Carius\"&gt;General Falx Carius&lt;/a&gt;. This weapon is &lt;a href=\"Champion%27s%20Cudgel\"&gt;Champion's Cudgel&lt;/a&gt;, a warhammer which has the symbol of the Empire engraved onto its side. Other Imperial styled weapons also exist in . These weapons are axes, maces, great swords, battle axes, mauls, daggers, and staffs. Imperial light cavalry makes use of sabers, while longswords is the standard weapon of Imperial officers.\nThe wooden short bow is the standard issue bow for the Legions, while the long bow is also used. While the Legion did mass-produce crossbows, they were less popular among its soldiers than the short and long bows.\nImperial weaponry of the second Era consisted of a combination of the colors red, silver, and gold. Imperial Shields often bore an Imperial crest or a ruby in a case of bronze or gold, alongside the wood from Cyrodiil's forests. Legionnaires would use red leather as much as possible on their grips to match their armor and their weaponry. Imperial axe heads had designs of red and copper, as well as carved pommels. This carving sometimes extended to the surface of the Imperial maces and axes. Some Legionnaires use the symbol of one of the major cities of Cyrodiil as carvings.\nSiege engines.\nThe Imperial Legion is known to use four siege machines, the catapult, battering ram, trebuchet and ballista.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Imperial%20Siege%20Engine\"&gt;Imperial Siege Engine&lt;/a&gt; is a card in \"Legends\" that has the image of a battering ram. It is manned by an unknown amount of Imperial soldiers, but it has two heavily armored soldiers manning the front of it. Furthermore, it appears to have an armored roof, and its ram consists of a log with a metal spike attached to the end of it.\nDuring the events of the Skyrim Civil War, the Legion made use of simple wooden catapults. The catapults appeared at the Battle of Windhelm, and were at the Imperial camp to the east of the city. The catapult could be manned by one person. When the catapult is activated, it will fire a projectile. Upon activating it again, a small crank will begin to move and the catapult will be brought back to the firing position to be loaded. The Legion generally uses firepots for their catapults, as well as their trebuchets, though normal boulders are also used as ammunition for catapults.\nDivisions.\nAs of the Fourth Era, average fighting strength of each Legion is comprised of 5,000 Legionnaires.\nForts and bases.\nThe Imperial Legion has secured many strategic locations for their forts to control the vast amounts of land in the Empire. During the events of \"Online\" the Legion made use of many different kinds of bases. In \"Morrowind\", the Legion made us of many large forts that were in prime condition. Oddly, the Imperial Legion in \"Oblivion\" makes no use of any forts. In the &lt;a href=\"Skyrim%20Civil%20War\"&gt;Skyrim Civil War&lt;/a&gt; during the events of \"Skyrim\" the Legion occupied old forts, many of which were falling apart and had to be repaired using wood defenses.\nThe Elder Scrolls Online.\nThe Legion also had a strong presence in the following cities, &lt;a href=\"Arenthia\"&gt;Arenthia&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Cheydinhal\"&gt;Cheydinhal&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Dune\"&gt;Dune&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Elden%20Root\"&gt;Elden Root&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Imperial%20City\"&gt;Imperial City&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Rawl%27kha\"&gt;Rawl'kha&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Satakalaam\"&gt;Satakalaam&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Vinedusk%20Village\"&gt;Vinedusk Village&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Wayrest\"&gt;Wayrest&lt;/a&gt;.\nMorrowind.\nThe Legion in &lt;a href=\"Morrowind\"&gt;Morrowind&lt;/a&gt; also had a strong presence in the cities of &lt;a href=\"Pelagiad\"&gt;Pelagiad&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Gnisis\"&gt;Gnisis&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Mournhold\"&gt;Mournhold&lt;/a&gt;.\nOblivion.\nThe Legion in &lt;a href=\"Cyrodiil\"&gt;Cyrodiil&lt;/a&gt; had only one base during the events of Oblivion, the &lt;a href=\"Prison%20District\"&gt;Prison District&lt;/a&gt; of the Imperial City. The old forts that dot Cyrodiil seem to have no value to the Imperial Legion and they are instead occupied by various bandits and necromancers.\nSkyrim.\nThe following forts are only under Imperial control if the &lt;a href=\"Last%20Dragonborn\"&gt;Last Dragonborn&lt;/a&gt; sides with the Legion during the Skyrim Civil War.\nArtifacts.\nThe Imperial Legion has several artifacts, this is a list of the known artifacts.\nCommanding ranks.\nThe Imperial Legion has had multiple different ranks commanding a Legion, the most common one being a General.\nSources.\nThe following books are related to the Imperial Legion:"}

A small garrison is maintained in the Legion Depot in the &lt;a href=\"Royal%20Palace\"&gt;Royal Palace&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Mournhold\"&gt;Mournhold&lt;/a&gt; as well. \nIn Ebonheart, a special Imperial Legion &lt;a href=\"Duke%27s%20Guard\"&gt;Guard&lt;/a&gt; garrison is entrusted with the protection of the &lt;a href=\"Duke%20Vedam%20Dren%20%28Morrowind%29\"&gt;Duke&lt;/a&gt; of Vvardenfell. There is a traditional rivalry between the Imperial Guard and their counterparts in the regular Legions.\nStructure.\nThe Legion is a strictly hierarchical organization. Each fort is usually commanded by a Champion (smaller forts) or any higher-ranking &lt;a href=\"Knight\"&gt;Knight&lt;/a&gt; (larger ones). The commander of a fort is usually called \"Captain\" or \"General.\" Only knights may serve as generals. A Knight of the Imperial Dragon is the highest-ranking Legion officer in any district. The Knight of the Imperial Dragon on Vvardenfell is &lt;a href=\"Varus%20Vantinius\"&gt;Varus Vantinius&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe Imperial Legion itself is sub-divided into armies, also called \"Legions,\" with numerals added for identification (for instance, the 10th Legion which fought on &lt;a href=\"Akavir\"&gt;Akavir&lt;/a&gt;).\nSkills required.\nThe Imperial Legion selects candidates on the basis of superior &lt;a href=\"Endurance%20%28Morrowind%29\"&gt;endurance&lt;/a&gt;, the soldierly virtue, and trustworthy &lt;a href=\"Personality%20%28Morrowind%29\"&gt;personality&lt;/a&gt;, the citizen's virtue, for service in the Legion is the model for the duties of Imperial citizenship. Troopers are expected to demonstrate mastery of the &lt;a href=\"Long%20Blade%20%28Morrowind%29\"&gt;long blade&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"spear\"&gt;spear&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Blunt%20Weapon%20%28Morrowind%29\"&gt;blunt weapons&lt;/a&gt;. Legion troops train with shield and &lt;a href=\"Heavy%20Armor%20%28Morrowind%29\"&gt;heavy armor&lt;/a&gt;, and so must be skilled at &lt;a href=\"Block%20%28Morrowind%29\"&gt;blocking&lt;/a&gt; and moving in heavy armor.\nAs a trooper or knight, you must master the long blade, spear, and blunt weapons. You must block whatever blows you can, and take unblocked blows upon your heavy armor. Recruit must also be proficient at &lt;a href=\"Athletics%20%28Morrowind%29\"&gt;athletics&lt;/a&gt;, both to march long distances with heavy packs, and to advance and maneuver, charge and retreat on the field of battle.\nArtifacts.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Lord%27s%20Mail%20%28Morrowind%29\"&gt;Lord's Mail&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Chrysamere%20%28Morrowind%29\"&gt;Chrysamere&lt;/a&gt; (a.k.a. the Paladin's Blade) are &lt;a href=\"Artifacts%20%28Morrowind%29\"&gt;artifacts&lt;/a&gt; of great importance to the Imperial Legion. \nPrior to the theft by a former Legion member, the Mail was on display in the Imperial Commission in Ebonheart, Morrowind. After having been retrieved from the traitorous legionnaire, they are kept by the Knight of the Imperial Dragon &lt;a href=\"Varus%20Vantinius\"&gt;Varus Vantinius&lt;/a&gt;.\nUniforms.\nThere are four different uniforms used by the Legion: &lt;a href=\"Imperial%20Steel%20Armor\"&gt;Imperial Steel&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Imperial%20Chain%20Armor\"&gt;Imperial Chain&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Imperial%20Templar%20Armor\"&gt;Imperial Templar&lt;/a&gt; for high-ranking knights and &lt;a href=\"Duke%27s%20Guard%20Silver%20Cuirass\"&gt;Duke's Guard Silver&lt;/a&gt; for the Imperial Guard and members of the Order of Ebonheart.\nUniforms are nessesary to talk to higher-ranking Legion members once the player joins the legion. Upon joining the Deathshed Legion in Gnisis, the player is given an Imperial Chain cuirass as their uniform. \nUpon promotion, the player will be given parts of the Imperial steel uniform, and upon promotion to Knight Errant parts of the Imperial Templar uniform.\nThe Lord's Mail can also be used as a Legion uniform once the player gets it in its &lt;a href=\"Lord%27s%20Mail%20%28Quest%29\"&gt;quest&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Imperial%20Studded%20Leather%20Cuirass\"&gt;Imperial studded leather cuirass&lt;/a&gt; is worn by Legion archers, but is not marked as a uniform and thus cannot be used as such by the player."}

(Note that this is the makeup of the Legion in Morrowind \u2014 in Oblivion, the Legion consists predominantly of Imperials, with a few notable exceptions in the ranks of the town guards.)\nThere are five Legion towns in the &lt;a href=\"Vvardenfell\"&gt;Vvardenfell&lt;/a&gt; district. Three of these are town garrisons: &lt;a href=\"Moonmoth%20Legion%20Fort\"&gt;Moonmoth Legion Fort&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Balmora\"&gt;Balmora&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Buckmoth%20Legion%20Fort\"&gt;Buckmoth Legion Fort&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Ald%27ruhn\"&gt;Ald'ruhn&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Fort%20Pelagiad\"&gt;Fort Pelagiad&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Pelagiad\"&gt;Pelagiad&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe Legion works for the Imperial government, with support from the Emperor. In peacetime, the legionnaires serve as guards; in war, they have also been used as an invasion force.\nIn war, the Imperial Legion is a feared and unstoppable force. Their huge numbers and strict discipline cause even the most battle-hardened army to question their tactics. With wide ranks of hundreds of disciplined soldiers, the Imperial Legion is a force not to be trifled with.\nHowever powerful their unstoppable numbers may make them appear, Imperials (who make up the majority of the legion) are not a natural warrior race. To counter this, they are a balanced and prolific race and the average trooper can be trained to hold their own against any foe. Still, they opt to attack with massive amounts of well-equipped and well-trained troops, to minimize the chance of failure and lower the morale of the opposition. Using diverse unit types -- including &lt;a href=\"archer\"&gt;archer&lt;/a&gt;s to cause damage, cavalry to run enemies down, officers to lead with their experience, and most importantly, their infantry platoons to crush the enemy infantry, as well as companies of &lt;a href=\"battlemage\"&gt;battlemage&lt;/a&gt;s to rain fire, ice, and lightning to the enemies and protect their allies with defensive spells -- the Imperial Legion is an unstoppable war machine, capable of crushing any opposing army in their tracks.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Lord%27s%20Mail\"&gt;Lord's Mail&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Chrysamere\"&gt;Chrysamere&lt;/a&gt;, also known as The Paladin's Blade, is an &lt;a href=\"Unique%20Items%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;artifacts&lt;/a&gt; of special importance to the Imperial Legion. Prior to the theft by a former legion member, the Mail was on display in the Imperial Commission in Ebonheart, Morrowind. After having been retrieved from the traitorous legionnaire, it is kept at an undisclosed location along with Chrysamere, presumably for security reasons.\nIn &lt;a href=\"Skyrim\"&gt;Skyrim&lt;/a&gt;, the Imperial Legion, led by &lt;a href=\"General%20Tullius%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;General Tullius&lt;/a&gt;, has a large foothold due to the civil war with the &lt;a href=\"Stormcloaks\"&gt;Stormcloaks&lt;/a&gt;. Their numbers and strength have dwindled since the Oblivion Crisis, which has prompted various assaults on &lt;a href=\"Tamriel\"&gt;Tamriel&lt;/a&gt; at large and, more specifically, &lt;a href=\"Cyrodiil\"&gt;Cyrodiil&lt;/a&gt;.\nSkills required.\nThe Imperial Legion selects candidates on the basis of superior &lt;a href=\"Endurance%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;Endurance&lt;/a&gt;, the soldierly virtue, and trustworthy &lt;a href=\"Personality%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;personality&lt;/a&gt;, the citizen's virtue, for service in the Legion is the model for the duties of Imperial citizenship. Troopers are expected to demonstrate mastery of the &lt;a href=\"Swords%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;Blade&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"spear\"&gt;spear&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Blunt%20Weapon%20%28Morrowind%29\"&gt;blunt weapons&lt;/a&gt;. Legion troops train with shield and &lt;a href=\"Heavy%20Armor%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;heavy armor&lt;/a&gt;, and so must be skilled at &lt;a href=\"Block%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;blocking&lt;/a&gt; and moving in heavy armor.\nAs a trooper or knight, you must master the long blade, spear, and blunt weapons. You must block whatever blows you can, and take unblocked blows upon your heavy armor. Recruits must also be proficient at &lt;a href=\"athletics%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;athletics&lt;/a&gt;, both to march long distances with heavy packs, and to advance and maneuver, charge and retreat on the field of battle.\nSpecial duties.\nThere are a number of special duties that Imperial Legion soldiers fulfill. Normally, the Legion is responsible for the projection of Imperial power in the provinces and the security of the Tamrielic roads. However, there are special companies of Legion soldiers that have different duties.\n&lt;a href=\"Imperial%20Forester\"&gt;Imperial Forester&lt;/a&gt;s.\nThe Imperial Foresters are rangers who patrol the dense forests of &lt;a href=\"Cyrodiil\"&gt;Cyrodiil&lt;/a&gt; and some other provinces. They are quick and nimble, lightly armored in comparison to their regular counterparts and equipped with bows and swords. They are usually seen prowling the forests and attacking &lt;a href=\"bandits%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;bandits&lt;/a&gt;, highwaymen, wolves etc. Also on rare occasion, possibly due to a glitch or mistaken 'friendly fire', they can be seen fighting each other and mounted legion soldiers that patrol Cyrodiil's roads.\nDuke's Guard and Palace Guard.\nA special Imperial Legion platoon comprises the guard of any duke in the province of &lt;a href=\"Morrowind\"&gt;Morrowind&lt;/a&gt;, the Duke of Vvardenfell, for instance. These soldiers are among the best the Legion has to offer; the most accomplished soldiers of the Duke's Guard have the honor of serving as personal Palace Guard to the King of Morrowind.\n&lt;a href=\"City%20Watch\"&gt;Imperial Watch&lt;/a&gt; and Imperial Palace Guard.\nThe Imperial Watch serves as city guard for the &lt;a href=\"Imperial%20City%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;Imperial City&lt;/a&gt;. It has guard towers in every district of the city, as well as the &lt;a href=\"Arcane%20University%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;Arcane University&lt;/a&gt;. The Watch is commanded by four Watch Captains, each with his own city district to protect. In the official version, the best soldiers of the Imperial Legion and the Imperial Watch serve as Imperial Palace Guard. However, it is suspected that most of the Imperial Palace Guard is made up of Blades, the special bodyguards and spies of the Emperor.\nGuaranteed Imperial Watch Loot:\nCounty Guards.\nWhen the need arises, the Counts of Cyrodiil may ask for a list of candidates of the Imperial Legion to serve as their city guards. Every Count has the authority to summon Legion soldiers to serve under their flag after the candidate list has been submitted. They are identified by their colors and coats of arms they wear belonging to the cities of Cyrodiil. In the end, though, their ultimate allegiance still resides with the Empire and they are still Legionnaires.\nImperial Legion Battlemage.\nMembers of both the Legion and &lt;a href=\"Mages%20Guild%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;Mages Guild&lt;/a&gt;, Imperial Legion Battlemages are soldiers trained in the use of magic and sword. They can mainly be seen on patrol within the &lt;a href=\"Arcane%20University%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;Arcane University&lt;/a&gt; in the Imperial City and also at Legion Forts located on Vvardenfell. They are outfitted in standard Imperial Legion armor, however, they wear a blue hood instead of a helm and rarely utilize a shield. In battle, they act as support to the main Imperial assault forces. Most recognize High Chancellor &lt;a href=\"Ocato\"&gt;Ocato&lt;/a&gt;, head of the &lt;a href=\"Elder%20Council\"&gt;Elder Council&lt;/a&gt;, as either their leader or their strongest ally.\nImperial Horsemen.\nSoldiers trained to fight on horseback, they act as a heavy cavalry force in wartime, delivering thunderous and unstoppable charges. However, in peacetime, they guard the Empire's roadways from bandits and &lt;a href=\"Goblin%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;goblins&lt;/a&gt;. They wear helmets similar to those of the Greek hoplites. In , however, they can't fight from horseback, so they must dismount to engage in combat.\nPrison Guards.\nLegion soldiers charged with defending the sewer entrance to the Imperial Prison in Imperial City. These men, under the command of Captain Gepard Montrose, are among the few legionnaires in the game who are in fact not Imperials. The section is made up of \"Captain &lt;a href=\"Gepard%20Montrose\"&gt;Gepard Montrose&lt;/a&gt;\" (&lt;a href=\"Bretons%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;Breton&lt;/a&gt;), \"Prison Guard\" (&lt;a href=\"Nords%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;Nord&lt;/a&gt;), \"Prison Guard\" (&lt;a href=\"Redguards%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;Redguard&lt;/a&gt;) and \"Prison Guard\" (&lt;a href=\"Altmer%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;Altmer&lt;/a&gt;).\nJailors.\nLegionnaires or county Guardsmen who hold the entrance to each City's Penitentiary. They are the only key holders to the cell blocks and must accompany prison visitors at all times. These men wear their respective count's crest and uniform (or in the case of the imperial city, the standard legion uniform) but refrain from carrying shields and choose to use maces as opposed to the standard issue silver long swords. There are generally two jailors to each city, one sleeps whilst the other is on duty and vice versa.\nStructure.\nThe Legion is a strictly hierarchic organization. Each fort is usually commanded by a Champion (smaller forts) or any higher-ranking &lt;a href=\"Knight\"&gt;Knight&lt;/a&gt; (larger ones). The commander of a fort is usually called \"Captain\" or \"General.\" Only knights may serve as generals. A Knight of the Imperial Dragon is the highest-ranking Legion officer in any district.\nThe Imperial Legion itself is sub-divided into armies, also called \"Legions,\" with numericals added for identification (for instance, the 10th Legion, which fought on &lt;a href=\"Akavir\"&gt;Akavir&lt;/a&gt;)."}

{"id": "16579", "revid": "17401442", "url": "https://elderscrolls.fandom.com/wiki?curid=16579", "title": "Imperial Legion (Skyrim)", "text": "The Imperial Legion is a joinable &lt;a href=\"Factions%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;faction&lt;/a&gt; in . Led by &lt;a href=\"General%20Tullius%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;General Tullius&lt;/a&gt;, they oppose the &lt;a href=\"Stormcloaks\"&gt;Stormcloak&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Skyrim%20Civil%20War\"&gt;rebellion&lt;/a&gt; and their attempt to secede &lt;a href=\"Skyrim\"&gt;Skyrim&lt;/a&gt; from the &lt;a href=\"Third%20Empire\"&gt;Third Empire&lt;/a&gt;. The &lt;a href=\"Last%20Dragonborn\"&gt;Dragonborn&lt;/a&gt; has the option of joining the Imperial Legion after &lt;a href=\"Alduin%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Alduin&lt;/a&gt;'s assault on &lt;a href=\"Helgen\"&gt;Helgen&lt;/a&gt;, regardless of whom the Dragonborn followed\u2014&lt;a href=\"Ralof\"&gt;Ralof&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"Hadvar\"&gt;Hadvar&lt;/a&gt;.\nPhilosophy.\nThe Imperial Legion believes that as a province of the Empire, Skyrim must abide by its laws and customs. Though most do not approve of the &lt;a href=\"White-Gold%20Concordat\"&gt;White-Gold Concordat&lt;/a&gt;, they nevertheless allow Thalmor Justiciars to enforce the ban in order to preserve the peace between the Empire and the &lt;a href=\"Aldmeri%20Dominion%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Aldmeri Dominion&lt;/a&gt;. If any legionaries are believers of &lt;a href=\"Talos\"&gt;Talos&lt;/a&gt;, such as &lt;a href=\"Legate%20Rikke%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Legate Rikke&lt;/a&gt; who is implied to be a believer, they keep their religion to themselves and pray to Talos discreetly and out of earshot.\nThough the Empire has appeased the Aldmeri Dominion's demands, the Imperial Legions in Skyrim claim that the Empire has little love for the Dominion. Most Imperial supporters believe that Skyrim and the Empire must remain united in order to fend off the Aldmeri Dominion if a second war with them erupts. Some accuse &lt;a href=\"Ulfric%20Stormcloak%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Ulfric Stormcloak&lt;/a&gt; of orchestrating the &lt;a href=\"Stormcloaks\"&gt;Stormcloaks&lt;/a&gt;' rebellion as a selfish ploy to set himself up as Skyrim's next &lt;a href=\"High%20King\"&gt;High King&lt;/a&gt;. The Imperial Legion believes that they can only restore peace to Skyrim and the Empire by killing Ulfric and quelling his rebellion.\nDescription.\nThe Imperial Legion in Skyrim consists of local militia and Imperial Legionnaires and is based in &lt;a href=\"Solitude%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Solitude&lt;/a&gt;. The Dragonborn may join and fight to keep Skyrim in the Empire. The Legion is comprised mostly of &lt;a href=\"Nords%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Nord&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Imperials%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Imperial&lt;/a&gt; legionnaires and &lt;a href=\"Legate\"&gt;Legate&lt;/a&gt;s, though there are &lt;a href=\"Bretons%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Breton&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Redguards%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Redguard&lt;/a&gt; legionnaires, along with &lt;a href=\"Altmer%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Altmer&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Dunmer%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Dunmer&lt;/a&gt;, and Breton &lt;a href=\"Legate\"&gt;Legate&lt;/a&gt;s.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Stormcloaks\"&gt;Stormcloaks&lt;/a&gt; are at odds with the Imperial Legion, as self-proclaimed liberators of the &lt;a href=\"Nords%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Nordic&lt;/a&gt; people. Because of this, the Legion is also at odds with the influential &lt;a href=\"Gray-Mane\"&gt;Gray-Mane&lt;/a&gt; family, an old and renowned &lt;a href=\"Whiterun%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Whiterun&lt;/a&gt; clan, whose views oppose those of the &lt;a href=\"Empire%20of%20Tamriel\"&gt;Empire of Tamriel&lt;/a&gt;. However, they have the support of the influential &lt;a href=\"Battle-Born\"&gt;Battle-Born&lt;/a&gt; clan, also in Whiterun. This has led to tensions between the clans in neutral Whiterun. Similarly, they are in good relations with the &lt;a href=\"Black-Briars\"&gt;Black-Briars&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"Riften\"&gt;Riften&lt;/a&gt; while the &lt;a href=\"Silver-Bloods\"&gt;Silver-Bloods&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"Markarth%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Markarth&lt;/a&gt; support the Stormcloaks.\nJoining the Legion.\nHadvar suggests that the Dragonborn join the Legion at the end of &lt;a href=\"Unbound\"&gt;Unbound&lt;/a&gt; if he is followed during the escape from &lt;a href=\"Helgen\"&gt;Helgen&lt;/a&gt;. Imperial Soldiers and Legates will also suggest joining the Legion if encountered. To join the Imperial Legion, the Dragonborn must travel to Solitude and find General Tullius in &lt;a href=\"Castle%20Dour%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Castle Dour&lt;/a&gt;, which is found by following the path up the ramps. Castle Dour will be to the left, guarded by Imperial soldiers. Tullius will say to speak with Legate Rikke. After talking to Rikke, the quest &lt;a href=\"Joining%20the%20Legion\"&gt;Joining the Legion&lt;/a&gt; will start and, when finished, the Dragonborn will take an oath and be officially inducted into the Imperial Army. The Dragonborn will also be rewarded with a set of &lt;a href=\"Imperial%20Armor\"&gt;Imperial Armor&lt;/a&gt; from the &lt;a href=\"Blacksmiths%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;blacksmith&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Beirand\"&gt;Beirand&lt;/a&gt;. Once the Dragonborn has joined the Imperial Legion, only one more opportunity remains to &lt;a href=\"The%20Jagged%20Crown%20%28Quest%29%23Optional%20betrayal%20-%20switching%20sides\"&gt;switch sides&lt;/a&gt;, leaving the Legion for the Stormcloaks. When the &lt;a href=\"The%20Jagged%20Crown%20%28Item%29\"&gt;Jagged Crown&lt;/a&gt; has been acquired, the Dragonborn can choose to travel to &lt;a href=\"Windhelm%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Windhelm&lt;/a&gt; where they can give the crown to &lt;a href=\"Ulfric%20Stormcloak%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Ulfric Stormcloak&lt;/a&gt; instead. &lt;a href=\"Jarl\"&gt;Jarl&lt;/a&gt; Ulfric will then recognize them as a Stormcloak soldier and immediately orders them to deliver an important &lt;a href=\"message%20to%20Whiterun\"&gt;message to Whiterun&lt;/a&gt; while skipping the formalities of making the Dragonborn swear the &lt;a href=\"Stormcloaks%23Oath\"&gt;Stormcloak oath&lt;/a&gt;.\nOath.\nAll new initiates to the Imperial Legion must recite the following oath:\n\"Upon my honor I do swear undying loyalty to the Emperor,\u00a0, and unwavering obedience to the officers of his great Empire. May those above judge me, and those below take me, if I fail in my duty. Long live the Emperor! Long live the Empire!\"\nTactics.\nImperial Soldiers in Skyrim largely make use of light armor and swords for their troops, which are typically used for scouting detail or small combat. The Legion utilizes ambushes, such as the ambush at Darkwater Crossing where they captured Ulfric, the ambush at &lt;a href=\"Giant%27s%20Gap\"&gt;Giant's Gap&lt;/a&gt;, or the ambush on a Stormcloak caravan. They are also said to be massacring the Stormcloaks in the field.\nArmor.\nThe Imperial Legion almost always uses full sets of &lt;a href=\"Imperial%20Light%20Armor\"&gt;Imperial Light Armor&lt;/a&gt;, often also making use of &lt;a href=\"Studded%20Imperial%20Armor\"&gt;Studded Imperial Armor&lt;/a&gt;. These are roughly equal to the light armor worn by Stormcloak soldiers.\nHigh-ranking legionnaires generally use &lt;a href=\"Imperial%20Armor%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Imperial Heavy Armor&lt;/a&gt;, making them considerably tougher opponents. By default, when joining the faction, three different armor sets can be chosen (light, medium, or heavy). The Legion's armor generally has a greater defense when compared to the Stormcloaks.\nPost-Civil War.\nAfter the conclusion of the civil war in favor of the Imperial Legion, the Dragonborn will be told there are still &lt;a href=\"Stormcloak%20camps\"&gt;Stormcloak camps&lt;/a&gt; out there to destroy. However, when visiting said camps, the commanders will still be flagged as &lt;a href=\"Essential%20Characters%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;essential&lt;/a&gt; and cannot be killed. Furthermore, the Stormcloak soldiers at these camps will eventually respawn. Additionally, citizens still mention the war.\nA number of notable changes occur after completing the Imperial Legion campaign:\nImperial camps.\nImperial camps serve as outposts for the Legion and are instrumental in the ongoing civil war. They are located in &lt;a href=\"Holds\"&gt;Holds&lt;/a&gt; that are controlled by the Stormcloaks. If the Legion takes over a hold, its camp in said hold disappears; and vice versa. The exception is &lt;a href=\"Haafingar\"&gt;Haafingar&lt;/a&gt;, which will not get an Imperial camp even if it falls to the Stormcloaks.\nThey are normally commanded by a &lt;a href=\"Legate\"&gt;Legate&lt;/a&gt; who can be found in their tent, and also have an &lt;a href=\"Imperial%20Quartermaster\"&gt;Imperial Quartermaster&lt;/a&gt; working at a &lt;a href=\"forge\"&gt;forge&lt;/a&gt; who will also serve as a &lt;a href=\"Merchants%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;merchant&lt;/a&gt;.\nRanks.\nThere are five ranks that can be earned by the Dragonborn if the Legion is joined during the Civil War questline. Progress in rank occurs at the completion of key battles during the war.\nUnobtainable ranks.\nThese ranks cannot be earned by the Dragonborn, but are still encountered in the game."}

Along with other branches of the Imperial Legion, the Foresters were expected to delay the spread of the daedra in any way possible. This naturally led to a high number of casualties within the Forester Legion, unlike other branches of the Legion, Foresters tend to work alone.\nCombat.\nIn combat, the Foresters will use their bows and not engage in sword combat (as they have no melee weapons) they have high Athletics skill and run very fast (to the extent they can catch up with a sprinting deer with ease) and use this to maneuver around enemies to flank them with volleys of levelled arrows from their silver bows."}

The navy has been tasked with anything from hunting down pirates to fighting wars and even invading the continent of &lt;a href=\"Akavir\"&gt;Akavir&lt;/a&gt;. They are known to have existed from the &lt;a href=\"First%20Era\"&gt;First Era&lt;/a&gt; through to the &lt;a href=\"Third%20Era\"&gt;Third&lt;/a&gt; and later &lt;a href=\"Fourth%20Era\"&gt;Fourth Era&lt;/a&gt;.\nHistory.\nThe Imperial Navy has seen many conflicts over the thousand years it has been around. It is charged with keeping peace throughout Tamriel by stopping pirates and even going to war with other nations if necessary.\n&lt;a href=\"First%20Era\"&gt;First Era&lt;/a&gt;.\nBramman incident.\nIn &lt;a href=\"1E%201033\"&gt;1E 1033&lt;/a&gt;, following many reports of piracy in the &lt;a href=\"Topal%20Bay\"&gt;Topal Bay&lt;/a&gt;, Empress &lt;a href=\"Hestra\"&gt;Hestra&lt;/a&gt; ordered the Imperial Navy to find and behead &lt;a href=\"Red%20Bramman\"&gt;Red Bramman&lt;/a&gt;, the most infamous of the pirates. The Imperial Navy fought many naval clashes against the pirates, each being as unsuccessful as the previous one. Following these battles, however, the Imperial Navy discovered Bramman's means of escaping capture. By sailing through a river hidden behind dense thickets of mangroves. Upon this discovery, the Imperial Navy followed the pirate crew, sailing deeper into Black Marsh than any non-Argonian had ever done before. Near &lt;a href=\"Blackrose\"&gt;Blackrose&lt;/a&gt;, they would eventually capture Bramman in his pirate kingdom, killing the pirate by taking his head for the Empress.\n&lt;a href=\"Second%20Era\"&gt;Second Era&lt;/a&gt;.\nRed Sails.\nIn &lt;a href=\"2E%20566\"&gt;2E 566&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Emperor%20Leovic\"&gt;Emperor Leovic&lt;/a&gt; had tasked the Imperial Navy with patrolling the &lt;a href=\"Abecean%20Sea\"&gt;Abecean Sea&lt;/a&gt; and secure safety and security around the Gold Coast region. The Navy, at the time, was feared, well-armed and had accomplished soldiers to secure safety. Prior to the Navy getting fathered in Anvil, the &lt;a href=\"Brena%20River\"&gt;Brena&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Strid%20River\"&gt;Strid River&lt;/a&gt; were both plagued by pirates. But when the Navy was sent to Anvil, these rivers were liberated.\nIn &lt;a href=\"2E%20577\"&gt;2E 577&lt;/a&gt; the Imperial Navy fought during the rebellion of &lt;a href=\"Varen%20Aquilarios\"&gt;Varen Aquilarios&lt;/a&gt;. As such, they left Anvil, to fight in the north and east, resulting in a pirate invasion of Anvil, led by &lt;a href=\"Governor%20Fortunata%20ap%20Dugal\"&gt;Fortunata ap Dugal&lt;/a&gt;, who is likely an ancestor of &lt;a href=\"Torradan%20ap%20Dugal\"&gt;Torradan ap Dugal&lt;/a&gt;. Fortunata was a shipping magnate of the &lt;a href=\"Gold%20Coast%20Trading%20Company%20%28Faction%29\"&gt;Gold Coast Trading Company&lt;/a&gt; and decided took over the docks and release her pirates to the docks of Anvil. These men quickly overpowered the troops loyal to the local Legion Prefect, after which Fortunata named herself governor of the Gold Coast, from the Abecean Sea to &lt;a href=\"Varen%27s%20Wall%20%28Location%29\"&gt;Varen's Wall&lt;/a&gt;. It was said that, due to the lack of an Imperial Navy to oppose Fortunata, the people near the Abecean Sea had to be careful of the pirate queen.\nTiber Wars.\nWhen &lt;a href=\"Tiber%20Septim\"&gt;Tiber Septim&lt;/a&gt; was still trying to conquer all of Tamriel the Imperial Navy undoubtedly saw combat all across Tamriel. However, the main fighting it did was that of the &lt;a href=\"New%20West%20Navy\"&gt;New West Navy&lt;/a&gt; in Hammerfell.\nThis faction of the navy had two known leaders, the first being &lt;a href=\"Vasi%20Hadrach\"&gt;Vasi Hadrach&lt;/a&gt; until sometime in the 9th century of the second era when he was assassinated. The second was one of Septims potentates, &lt;a href=\"Amiel%20Richton\"&gt;Amiel Richton&lt;/a&gt;. Under Amiel the navy went on to win the &lt;a href=\"Battle%20of%20Hunding%20Bay\"&gt;Battle of Hunding Bay&lt;/a&gt; where he defeated the heir of the last High King of Hammerfell, Prince &lt;a href=\"A%27Tor\"&gt;A'Tor&lt;/a&gt;. After this battle &lt;a href=\"Stros%20M%27Kai\"&gt;Stros M'Kai&lt;/a&gt; was conquered, which was the last place in Hammerfell unconquered by the Empire.\nThe New West Navy navy consisted of mostly &lt;a href=\"Colovian\"&gt;Colovian&lt;/a&gt; Nobility, and was widely considered unbeatable, and was also used during the invasion of Morrowind, where they fought in badly coordinated battles near Black Marsh's border swamps.\n&lt;a href=\"Third%20Era\"&gt;Third Era&lt;/a&gt;.\n&lt;a href=\"War%20of%20the%20Isle\"&gt;War of the Isle&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe War of the Isle was a war waged by the &lt;a href=\"Maormer\"&gt;Maormer&lt;/a&gt; against the &lt;a href=\"Summerset%20Isles\"&gt;Summerset Isles&lt;/a&gt; in an attempt to conqeur the land. Due to the pride of the &lt;a href=\"Altmer\"&gt;Altmer&lt;/a&gt;, this war was nearly succcesfull, but despite their pride, they did eventually call upon the &lt;a href=\"Psijics\"&gt;Psijics&lt;/a&gt; and the Empire. Some sources suggest that the Altmer themselves did not call upon the Psijics, but the Empire did. The main support that the Empire provided was, however, through its navy. The combined forces of the Altmer navy, Imperial navy, and Psijic Order managed to push back the Maormer, through a powerful storm created by the Psijics.\nAkaviri Invasion.\nThe navy played a major role in the Empire's assault on &lt;a href=\"Akavir\"&gt;Akavir&lt;/a&gt; from around &lt;a href=\"3E%20271\"&gt;3E 271&lt;/a&gt; to &lt;a href=\"3E%20290\"&gt;3E 290&lt;/a&gt;. In the year 270 of the Third Era, the Emperor, &lt;a href=\"Uriel%20Septim%20V\"&gt;Uriel Septim V&lt;/a&gt;, began planning an invasion of Akavir and several islands in-between Tamriel and the continent. It was decided that the current size of the Imperial Navy was not large enough to carry out this invasion, so the Emperor ordered that new ships be built. Thus the &lt;a href=\"Far%20East%20Fleet\"&gt;Far East Fleet&lt;/a&gt; was created. It was said to be so large that the new fleet dwarfed the remaining fleets of the navy. The fleet is known to have been able to carry at least two Legions with large amounts of supplies for a long voyage.\nThe fleet was originally made to invade Akavir, but it had other objectives as well. Before it could sail to Akavir the fleet needed to conquer the islands of &lt;a href=\"Roscrea\"&gt;Roscrea&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Esroniet\"&gt;Esroniet&lt;/a&gt;. These islands would be used by the Imperial Navy as military ports to sail to Akavir. Once the islands had been taken, the fleet was loaded up with &lt;a href=\"Imperial%20Legion\"&gt;Imperial Legion&lt;/a&gt; soldiers and sent off to Akavir.\nWhen the fleet arrived they did no fighting. The &lt;a href=\"Tsaesci\"&gt;Tsaesci&lt;/a&gt; had no navy for the Imperial Navy to face, so they simply delivered off their troops. Many sailed off to perform supply runs across the ocean and bring more legions and settlers over for the invasion. However constant storms slowed and eventually halted all sailing across the ocean until the Emperor authorized the use of battlemages to accompany the fleet to stop the storms. Eventually disaster struck the legions in Akavir and almost every soldier was killed, along with the Emperor. Much of the fleet was also destroyed in this failed conquest.\nCamoran Usurper.\nWhen the &lt;a href=\"Camoran%20Usurper\"&gt;Camoran Usurper&lt;/a&gt; began to damage the Empire, the Imperial Navy took every ship, including pirate ships, to fight in the war. As a result of the war, the Navy did not respond to various smugglers around the &lt;a href=\"Gold%20Coast\"&gt;Gold Coast&lt;/a&gt;, and because the Navy needed supplies in &lt;a href=\"High%20Rock\"&gt;High Rock&lt;/a&gt;, and had no forces to guard them, pirates took a profit. With the Navy too occupied fighting the Camoran Usurper, eastern Tamriel became fearful of a pirate gang known as the &lt;a href=\"Red%20Sabre\"&gt;Red Sabre&lt;/a&gt;s. As a result, the captain of these pirates, Torradan ap Dugal, got a bounty on his head worth 40.000.\nWhen the Camoran Usurper was eventually beaten Commodore &lt;a href=\"Fasil%20Umbranox\"&gt;Fasil Umbranox&lt;/a&gt; turned his attention on the Red Sabres. He sent out many ships and men in his search for the pirates, and after four years, found them. Captain Dugal had tricked Umbranox's main force with a fake trail, and tried to catch the Commodore off guard, but Umbranox had left men behind just in case the pirates came back. The pirates fought the Navy in the bay, as the Imperials had set fire to the town to prevent the pirates from escaping on land. Most Imperials didn't really care, as at the time Anvil was mainly settled by thieves. When the battle ended, only two ships were left standing; the pirates' &lt;a href=\"Black%20Flag\"&gt;Black Flag&lt;/a&gt;, and Umbranox's Flagship. This was largely due to Umbranox having &lt;a href=\"Imperial%20Legion%20Battlemage%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;Imperial Mages&lt;/a&gt; aboard his ships.\nCaptain Dugal, who knew defeat was coming, tried to flee from Umbranox. However, in his retreat, Umbranox's battlemages cast spells at the Black Flag, causing the nearby cliff to slowly collapse and seal the pirate and his crew in.

In this quest, the &lt;a href=\"Eternal%20Champion\"&gt;Champion&lt;/a&gt; uses the &lt;a href=\"Staff%20of%20Chaos\"&gt;Staff of Chaos&lt;/a&gt; to defeat &lt;a href=\"Jagar%20Tharn%20%28Arena%29\"&gt;Jagar Tharn&lt;/a&gt; and free &lt;a href=\"Emperor\"&gt;Emperor&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Uriel%20Septim%20VII\"&gt;Uriel Septim VII&lt;/a&gt;.\nWalkthrough.\nRia Silmane.\nOnce the &lt;a href=\"Eternal%20Champion\"&gt;Eternal Champion&lt;/a&gt; obtained the last piece of the &lt;a href=\"Staff%20of%20Chaos\"&gt;Staff of Chaos&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Dagoth-Ur%20%28Arena%20Location%29\"&gt;Dagoth-Ur&lt;/a&gt;, the ethereal Ria Silmane will contact them again and explain why the completed artifact is not working. She thought that repairing the Staff of Chaos would be sufficient to save the &lt;a href=\"Uriel%20Septim%20VII\"&gt;Emperor&lt;/a&gt; from the dimension where he was sent by &lt;a href=\"Jagar%20Tharn%20%28Arena%29\"&gt;Jagar Tharn&lt;/a&gt;, however the Imperial Wizard retained the magical potential of the Staff inside a rare gem before splitting it. This gem, called the Jewel of Fire, is said to be a star fallen from the sky. Ria Silmane says the only way to defeat her treacherous old master is to rejoin the Staff of Chaos with its power inside the Jewel of Fire. This would not only open the portal to the dimension where the Emperor remains, but also destroy Jagar Tharn once his life force is also stored inside that gem.\nThe deceased mage explains that the Eternal Champion will have to face Jagar Tharn in person to finish his quest; this means traveling to the &lt;a href=\"Imperial%20City\"&gt;Imperial City&lt;/a&gt; and defeating Tharn inside the &lt;a href=\"Imperial%20Palace\"&gt;Imperial Palace&lt;/a&gt;. However, the usurper, in his fear, ordered the guards to prevent anyone from entering the Palace. Ria Silmane will sacrifice her last amount of energy holding her in ethereal form to cast a spell on the guards, making them let the Eternal Champion enter the place.\nRia Silmane remembers the Eternal Champion that he achieved extraordinary accomplishments during his journey, which is about to end very soon. She gives her long-time companion a last goodbye and thanks them for all they have done.\nImperial City.\nThe Imperial City is the capital of the &lt;a href=\"Empire\"&gt;Empire&lt;/a&gt;. It has a different design from all the other cities and settlements, and seems to be handmade, and not randomly generated like cities in the rest of the provinces.\nBefore entering the Imperial Palace, the Eternal Champion can obtain equipment in the various shops of the city. In order to calmly explore the Palace, it is imperative to be well prepared (\"some recommended items can be verified in the next section\").\nImperial Palace.\nRecommended effects:\nAs the Eternal Champion enters the Imperial Palace, the usurper Jagar Tharn appears as the Emperor, quickly transforming himself into his true identity. He gives a last warning to his opponent\u2014to not be fooled by their achievements, for they had never faced a being as powerful as him. The Imperial Wizard awaits in the depths of the dungeon.\nThe Imperial Palace is the last dungeon in the main quest of , and probably the hardest. The four levels which compose the Palace are medium-sized, however some of the most dangerous creatures in the game are encountered in these areas, specially the Third and Fourth Levels, where legions of &lt;a href=\"Lich%20%28Arena%29\"&gt;Liches&lt;/a&gt; are clashed.\nInside the Imperial Palace it is possible to encounter &lt;a href=\"Wraith%20%28Arena%29\"&gt;Wraiths&lt;/a&gt;, Knights (who are not creatures), &lt;a href=\"Fire%20Daemon\"&gt;Fire Daemon&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"Iron%20Golem\"&gt;Iron Golem&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Homonculi\"&gt;Homonculi&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Vampire%20%28Arena%29\"&gt;Vampires&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Lich\"&gt;Lich&lt;/a&gt;es.\nFirst Level.\nThe First Level is mainly composed by the entrance to the Palace, the Main Room where the &lt;a href=\"Ruby%20Throne\"&gt;Ruby Throne&lt;/a&gt; is encountered and sleep rooms. This zone should not be dangerous at this point of the &lt;a href=\"Main%20Quest%20%28Arena%29\"&gt;Main Quest&lt;/a&gt;, considering that only average opponents are encountered,\u2014such as Wraiths and Knights\u2014with the exception of Fire Daemons, who should still be dangerous.\nThere are three entrances to the Second Level: two of them are encountered in the northern corridors, one in the northwest, and another in the northeast. There is also an entrance located in the east, after some sleep rooms. A hidden passage on the left side of the Ruby Throne can be used to reach the northern corridor faster.\nUsing the third entrance described will reveal a much shorter way to reach the Third and Fourth Levels.\nSecond Level.\nThe Second Level is also a medium-sized area, however it is a bit more complex than the First. In this level there will be Vampires and Iron Golems, so caution is recommended, especially with the first one.\nThere are two entrances to the Third Level: one is very close to the center of the area, another is right into the southeast. The entrance located close to the center of the area is without doubt the most useful, it will take the Eternal Champion much closer to the entrances of the Fourth Level.\nThird Level.\nAt this level the situation becomes harder, with Homonculi being constantly encountered in the corridors. This level is, however, less complex than the Second because both entrances to the Fourth Level are located close to each other.\nThe two doors to the Fourth Level are located in the east, the northern entrance is easier to be reached however the southern will provide a more safe place inside the Fourth Level.\nFourth Level.\nThe Fourth Level is the final zone of the Imperial Palace, and it is indeed the most dangerous place in . Legions of Liches will be encountered in the way to Jagar Tharn. Without being cautious, the Eternal Champion will be easily defeated by these undead.\nThe northern door directs the Eternal Champion to a seemingly blocked corridor, however the two walls blocking the way are \"false,\" which means they can be walked through. In this little corridor there will be a Lich behind the fake wall which can surprise the unwary. The southern door will direct the Eternal Champion to a safer position inside the last zone, however Liches still will be encountered.\nJagar Tharn is inside a platform surrounded by lava on the center of the dungeon. To reach the platform it is necessary to walk around the unbreakable walls surrounding the lava and open the door in the end of the corridor. However, if the Eternal Champion makes use of the effect &lt;a href=\"Passwall%20%28Arena%29\"&gt;Passwall&lt;/a&gt;, they can break the way located in the southern zone, which is not blocked by unbreakable walls.\nThe central platform is surrounded by a lava lake and Liches will be above minor platforms connected to the walls. The Eternal Champion must use the effect Levitation to reach the main platform where the Imperial Wizard will be standing together with the Jewel of Fire.\nThe central platform has four cells, each one located in the corners of the ground. The Jewel of Fire is located inside the locked northeastern cell. Fortunately, the Mithril Key can be found remaining inside the northwestern cell, which is also locked but can be opened by simply attacking its door (\"the Mithril Key is represented by a white marker and the Jewel of Fire is represented by a yellow marker in the map on the right\").\nFighting Jagar Tharn is actually completely optional, but doing so will give a great amount of experience points. The Imperial Wizard disposes of powerful spells such as &lt;a href=\"Wizard%27s%20Fire%20%28Arena%29\"&gt;Wizard's Fire&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Ice%20Bolt%20%28Arena%29\"&gt;Ice Bolt&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Wyvern%27s%20Sting\"&gt;Wyvern's Sting&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Lightning%20%28Arena%29\"&gt;Lightning&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Far%20Silence%20%28Arena%29\"&gt;Far Silence&lt;/a&gt;. He has 500 points of &lt;a href=\"Health%20%28Arena%29\"&gt;Health&lt;/a&gt; and 300 Spellpoints. He can deal a moderate damage of 10\u201325 points in \"melee\" and can see invisible characters. Tharn also seems to be immune to any weapon - the only realiable way to hurt him is with your bare fists. After having his Health depleted, the Imperial Wizard will protect himself inside a magical shield, making him invulnerable to almost any attack \u2014 but it will not save him from the Staff of Chaos.\nThe Eternal Champion must open the cell where the Jewel of Fire remains and touch the gem. This will active the final scene of the game.\nEnd.\nAs the Eternal Champion throws the Staff of Chaos in the Jewel of Fire, a great light consumes the room, opening a portal to the dimension where the Jagar Tharn imprisoned the Emperor.\nThe Imperial Wizard shouts, desperate and in vain, telling the Eternal Champion to not do that. In seconds, the usurper is consumed by fire and becomes ash. The true Emperor Uriel Septim VII emerges from the portal and talks with his savior, finally rewarding them with the title of Eternal Champion.\nThe game then congratulates the Eternal Champion for finishing the Main Quest."}

While this work will no double bring great glory and benefit to the &lt;a href=\"Empire\"&gt;Empire&lt;/a&gt;, it is clear that my limited expertise is of no use to this effort.\nI have instead been using my considerable free time to investigate a particular avenue of study, namely that of the Fall of &lt;a href=\"Saarthal\"&gt;Saarthal&lt;/a&gt;. Every child of the Empire knows what happened here; that the first city of Man on &lt;a href=\"Tamriel\"&gt;Tamriel&lt;/a&gt; was sacked by the &lt;a href=\"Snow%20Elf\"&gt;elves&lt;/a&gt;, jealous and fearful of the threat men posed to them. Relations have obviously improved considerably since then, but to be able to see the results of the destruction first-hand, it is quite striking to note the degree of effort that went into the venture.\nThe first task before me was differentiating between areas of original architecture and those that were rebuilt after &lt;a href=\"Ysgramor%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Ysgramor&lt;/a&gt; retook the city with his five hundred companions. Initially relying heavily on the expertise of archaeologist Floronius, my ability to discern the difference for myself improved over time. Indeed, I was surprised to find that many areas of the city, far more than I would have believed, retained much of the original stonework. Work was clearly done to remedy the effects of the city being burned after the elves' assault, but I suspect they underestimated the durability of Nordic craftsmanship.\nOr rather, that is what I initially thought. Perhaps it was a mistaken sense of pride in the accomplishments of these early men, or perhaps it was just my inexperience that led me to this conclusion. Something was amiss, though. Repeated attempted to consult the exceedingly perceptive archaeologist were unfruitful, often digressing into lectures on the bathing habits of Saarthal residents, or the average number of potted plants in homes. I was again forced to rely on my limited powers of observation and deduction.\nAnd so I have no conclusive results to report at this time. I can say with certainty that the initial attack on Saarthal seems to have been very focused, and does not appear to correlate to any locations that have been established as points of defense or importance. While the eminent scholar Sentius has yet to examine my findings, or indeed show any interest in them, my inclination is to suggest that not only did the elves know the apparent layout of the city, but that their assault was based on a specific directive and perhaps a singular goal.\nMy humble investigations shall continue as time persists."}

He then stole the staff and disappeared.\nLater, he managed to become the Imperial Battlemage of &lt;a href=\"Uriel%20Septim%20VII\"&gt;Uriel Septim VII&lt;/a&gt;. In 3E 389, he captured Uriel VII and banished him into\u00a0&lt;a href=\"Oblivion%20%28Realm%29\"&gt;Oblivion&lt;/a&gt;\u00a0with the Staff of Chaos. Normally when the Emperor of Tamriel dies, the Elder Council is magically informed by the &lt;a href=\"Amulet%20of%20Kings\"&gt;Amulet of Kings&lt;/a&gt; and meets to select a successor. By sequestering Uriel Septim VII in another dimension, where time ran slower, Tharn prevented this from happening. He then broke the staff into eight pieces and hid them in the other provinces of Tamriel. Using his powerful, and skillful knack for &lt;a href=\"Illusion\"&gt;Illusion&lt;/a&gt;, he took on the visage of Uriel VII, and ruled the Empire, replacing the Emperor's guard and servants with &lt;a href=\"Daedra\"&gt;Daedra&lt;/a&gt;.\nSeveral years later, he made a bargain with &lt;a href=\"Mehrunes%20Dagon\"&gt;Mehrunes Dagon&lt;/a&gt; to invade &lt;a href=\"Battlespire\"&gt;Battlespire&lt;/a&gt;, the Imperial training facility and bastion of the Imperial Battlemages. This move was essential to secure his position and to eliminate a possible threat to his reign. Mehrunes Dagon was destroyed and cast back into Oblivion by a mysterious hero, but the Battlespire was destroyed. The Imperial Battlemages, a potential threat to Tharn, were no longer capable of thwarting Tharn's reign.\nIn &lt;a href=\"3E%20397\"&gt;3E 397&lt;/a&gt;, Tharn and &lt;a href=\"Pergan%20Asuul\"&gt;Pergan Asuul&lt;/a&gt; tried to manipulate the &lt;a href=\"War%20of%20Bend%27r%20Mahk\"&gt;War of Bend'r Mahk&lt;/a&gt; to create the Shadow of War, the powerful creature known as &lt;a href=\"Umbra%27Keth\"&gt;Umbra'Keth&lt;/a&gt;. However, another mysterious hero with the help of &lt;a href=\"Skelos%20Undriel\"&gt;Skelos Undriel&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Azra%20Nightwielder\"&gt;Azra Nightwielder&lt;/a&gt;, thwarted his plan.\nHis reign is ended in &lt;a href=\"3E%20399\"&gt;3E 399&lt;/a&gt;. The &lt;a href=\"Eternal%20Champion\"&gt;Eternal Champion&lt;/a&gt;, with the help of &lt;a href=\"Ria%20Silmane\"&gt;Ria Silmane&lt;/a&gt; and Lady Barenziah, managed to gather the hidden pieces of the Staff of Chaos. During the final battle, in the depths of the Imperial Palace Dungeon, the champion managed to grab the &lt;a href=\"Jewel%20of%20Fire\"&gt;Jewel of Fire&lt;/a&gt;, a jewel that held Tharn's power and the whole energy of the Staff of Chaos. Jagar Tharn was slain, Uriel Septim VII was rescued, and the hero was declared as the Eternal Champion."}

While part of the Imperial forces within the province was not born in Skyrim, a considerable portion of them are local recruits, as the Legion in Skyrim gets few reinforcements from the rest of the &lt;a href=\"Mede%20Empire\"&gt;Empire&lt;/a&gt;. Legionnaires join the Legion forces in Skyrim for a variety of reasons. Some join out of tradition, as their parents were Legionnaires before them and they never considered doing anything else. Others joined out of a desire to see the world, while there were also those who joined the Legion to actively put a halt to the &lt;a href=\"Stormcloaks\"&gt;Stormcloaks&lt;/a&gt;, despite their families often disagreeing with the notion.\nLegionnaires within Skyrim are largely considered to be militia, a feat reflected in their armor, which is often light and not meant for full-on combat. While their forces are commanded by &lt;a href=\"General%20Tullius%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;General Tullius&lt;/a&gt;, the local recruitment process is performed by Legate Rikke. The most common races making up the Imperial forces in Skyrim are &lt;a href=\"Imperials%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Imperials&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Nords%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Nords&lt;/a&gt;, though &lt;a href=\"Redguards%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Redguards&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Bretons%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Bretons&lt;/a&gt; also make up its forces. Among the officers, even a &lt;a href=\"Dunmer%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Dunmer&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Altmer%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Altmer&lt;/a&gt; Legate can be found. Dunmer farmers within Skyrim are occassionally seen making their way to Solitude to join up with the Legion, as they see their treatment at the hands of the Nords as injust. These Dunmer are, however, never seen as Imperial soldiers.\nBattle and interactions.\nUnlike &lt;a href=\"Stormcloak%20Soldier\"&gt;Stormcloak Soldier&lt;/a&gt;s, whose ranks are relatively equal in terms of gender, Legion soldiers are all males, with only four female soldiers found at the beginning of the game; one Imperial Soldier at the tower in Helgen, one &lt;a href=\"Imperial%20Captain\"&gt;Imperial Captain&lt;/a&gt;, one &lt;a href=\"Imperial%20Mage%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Imperial Mage&lt;/a&gt; fighting &lt;a href=\"Alduin%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Alduin&lt;/a&gt;, and one Legate, &lt;a href=\"Legate%20Rikke%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Legate Rikke&lt;/a&gt;. However, it is possible for the Legionnaire's corpse at &lt;a href=\"Dragontooth%20Crater\"&gt;Dragontooth Crater&lt;/a&gt; to be female, as well as an Imperial corpse at &lt;a href=\"Shor%27s%20Watchtower\"&gt;Shor's Watchtower&lt;/a&gt;.\nSiding with the Imperial Legion during the Civil War prompts soldiers to greet the &lt;a href=\"Last%20Dragonborn\"&gt;Dragonborn&lt;/a&gt; with their &lt;a href=\"Imperial%20Legion%20%28Skyrim%29%23Rank\"&gt;rank&lt;/a&gt;.\nApparel.\nImperial Legion Soldiers wear a full set of &lt;a href=\"Imperial%20Light%20Armor\"&gt;Imperial Light Armor&lt;/a&gt;, wearing either &lt;a href=\"Studded%20Imperial%20Armor\"&gt;Studded Imperial Armor&lt;/a&gt; or normal &lt;a href=\"Imperial%20Light%20Armor%20%28Armor%20Piece%29\"&gt;Imperial Light Armor&lt;/a&gt;.

Members of the Imperial race are some of the most well-educated, wealthy, and well-spoken people in Tamriel. Natives of the civilized cosmopolitan province of Cyrodiil, they have proved to be shrewd diplomats, traders, and tacticians.\nCyrodiil.\nCyrodiil is the cosmopolitan heartland of Tamriel. It has served as the seat of power for several major empires, such as the &lt;a href=\"Alessian%20Empire\"&gt;Alessian Empire&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"Reman%20Empire\"&gt;Reman Empire&lt;/a&gt;, and the &lt;a href=\"Third%20Empire\"&gt;Third Empire&lt;/a&gt;, and as such is commonly known as simply, \"The Imperial Province.\" It is home to the &lt;a href=\"Imperial%20City\"&gt;Imperial City&lt;/a&gt; where the\u00a0&lt;a href=\"Emperor\"&gt;Emperor&lt;/a&gt; and his &lt;a href=\"Elder%20Council\"&gt;Elder Council&lt;/a&gt; live and rule.\nPhysiology.\nImperials can be differentiated from &lt;a href=\"Bretons\"&gt;Bretons&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Nords\"&gt;Nords&lt;/a&gt; by their fair to swarthy skin, as opposed to the typically fairer complexion of Bretons and Nords. However, Imperial skin tone is not as dark as that of &lt;a href=\"Redguards\"&gt;Redguards&lt;/a&gt;. Imperials also have slightly sharper faces than other races of &lt;a href=\"men\"&gt;men&lt;/a&gt;. They are descendants of the native &lt;a href=\"Nedic\"&gt;Nedic&lt;/a&gt; and other Proto-Cyrod peoples that were enslaved by the &lt;a href=\"Ayleid\"&gt;Ayleid&lt;/a&gt;s.\nHistory.\nImperials, like any race, have had their share of both internal and external conflicts in their native homeland. Due to relatively frequent invasions from various Elven civilizations and simply Cyrodiil's sheer size, unification of the region as a whole was proven a difficult task.\nThe earliest known Empire in Cyrodiil was the Empire of the &lt;a href=\"Ayleid\"&gt;Ayleid&lt;/a&gt;s, which had ruled since before recorded history. The &lt;a href=\"Fall%20of%20White-Gold%20Tower\"&gt;Fall of White-Gold Tower&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"1E%20243\"&gt;1E 243&lt;/a&gt; is the year generally associated with the end of Ayleid rule over humans in Cyrodiil. In the same year of &lt;a href=\"Alessian%20Rebellion\"&gt;Alessia's rebellion&lt;/a&gt; came the &lt;a href=\"Alessian%20Empire\"&gt;Alessian Empire&lt;/a&gt;, created by the former human slaves of the Ayleids, including &lt;a href=\"Alessia\"&gt;Alessia&lt;/a&gt;. The Empire, alongside the monotheistic religion that had grown to prominence during the same time, the &lt;a href=\"Alessian%20Order\"&gt;Alessian Order&lt;/a&gt;, eventually collapsed in a war known as the &lt;a href=\"War%20of%20Righteousness\"&gt;War of Righteousness&lt;/a&gt;.\nCulture.\nThe Imperials are considered clever and industrious, as well as educated and well-spoken. Placing faith in hard work, education, and discipline, they are known for their enlightened rule of law and government. Imperials also make for shrewd diplomats and traders. In general, Imperials prefer free trade and diplomacy over most other things, but are not afraid to use force if necessary. The Imperials accept freedom of religion alongside different cultures, and their Empires are held together by a strong Emperor, the bureacracy, the rule of law, and the Legions. Throughout the social classes where Imperial culture has flourished, education and wealth is broadly distributed, allowing many citizens to become literate. Imperial culture also enables free trade within the lands of the Empire. Slavery is commonly shunned by Imperial ways, and is illegal within Imperial land. Due to the size of the Empire during the &lt;a href=\"Third%20Era\"&gt;Third Era&lt;/a&gt;, Imperial culture has become a combination of various cultures of their subjects. As such, any of any race can advance in wealth and status in commerce, the bureaucracy, and the military. Near the end of the Third Era, moral and political corruption at the highest levels of Imperial society, and the cost of military occupations in hostile provinces, made people suspect the Empire was approaching a decline. Imperial taxes are handled by the &lt;a href=\"Census%20and%20Excise\"&gt;Census and Excise&lt;/a&gt;, and are based on the head count of the taxed region. The Census and Excise also deals with Imperial licenses, such as imports and mercenary company incorporation. Imperial buildings are often of timbered, half-timbered, or stone construction, with peaked roofs, right angles and flat planes, and plain, undecorated exteriors.\nWithin Imperial culture, blood vampires are considered monsters to be hunted and destroyed. Despite this, however, notions of noble and virtuous vampires exist in Imperial tradition, and are believed to also take part in the Mages Guild and Imperial aristocracy. The latter being proven right by Count &lt;a href=\"Janus%20Hassildor\"&gt;Janus Hassildor&lt;/a&gt;, the vampiric count of &lt;a href=\"Skingrad\"&gt;Skingrad&lt;/a&gt;.\nColovia.\nColovia is the western portion of Cyrodiil. The natives of the land are the Cyro-Nords who had left the fertile lands of Nibenay. Their culture developed different from their eastern counterparts, with a dislike for magic and industry, instead preferring warfare and plundering. Upon conquering the entirety of western Cyrodiil, these Colovians also became masters of seafaring, creating fleets whose earliest voyages allowed them to raid the Illiac Bay and the Cape of the Blue Divide annually, until the arrival of the Yokudan Navies, which were superior. When the East of Cyrodiil fell to the Alessian Reformation, the west stood strong, and continued to venerate the Eight Divines, following which Colovia isolated itself by forming the &lt;a href=\"Colovian%20Estates\"&gt;Colovian Estates&lt;/a&gt;. In &lt;a href=\"1E%202200\"&gt;1E 2200&lt;/a&gt;, the All Flags Navy under the command of &lt;a href=\"Bendu%20Olo\"&gt;Bendu Olo&lt;/a&gt;, the Colovian King of Anvil, successfully invaded Thras. Because of this Colovia grew in wealth, resulting in the &lt;a href=\"War%20of%20Righteousness\"&gt;War of Righteousness&lt;/a&gt;, in which the Alessian Legions attempted to conquer the Colovians, ultimately failing and resulting in the fall of the Alessian rule.\nFor over four hundreds year, the West enjoyed relative peace and quiet, until the rise of &lt;a href=\"Reman%20Cyrodiil\"&gt;Reman Cyrodiil&lt;/a&gt;. This son of the west unified the Colovians and the Nibenese to fight against the Akaviri in &lt;a href=\"1E%202703\"&gt;1E 2703&lt;/a&gt;, succesfully fighting them in the northern reaches of Cyrodiil. At the end of the war, the people of Cyrodiil felt united, and felt a responsibility to protect the northern human kingdoms.\nFollowing the death of the last Reman Emperor, the East and West split from another and became independent once more. One of the kings of the Colovian Estates, &lt;a href=\"Cuhlecain\"&gt;Cuhlecain&lt;/a&gt; eventually rose up. In but a year's time, Cuhlecain's army had unified more than half of Cyrodiil, and aimed his eyes on Nibenany and the Imperial City. The Nords and Bretons, fearing another Empire forming, attempted an invasion of the Colovian West, only to fail at the &lt;a href=\"Battle%20of%20Sancre%20Tor\"&gt;Battle of Sancre Tor&lt;/a&gt;.\nSince the days of Tiber Septim, the Colovians still posses most of their frontier spirit. Being self-sufficient, hearty, extremely loyal, hard working, tough-minded, and uncomplicated. They also pride themselves in their reputation for being independent, rough, and rebellious, with much of their income coming from the export of wood. When the Empire suffers a weak ruler, the Colovians withdraw onto their own land and take care of their own, believing they kept the national spirit alive. At the same time, when a mighty Emperor has the throne, the Colovians gladly serve in his ranks. Many Colovians take up positions in the Imperial Legions and Navy, proud for their role within the army, not caring for courtly life. Even so, despite the Colovians feeling superior as a people to their Nibenean cousins, they are often neglected in Cyrodiil due to the Nibenese forming the heart of the Empire.\nNibenay.\nImperial society truly started in the Nibenay Valley, a large grassland with &lt;a href=\"Lake%20Rumare\"&gt;Lake Rumare&lt;/a&gt; at its heart. Rice and textile were its main exports, though the people of Nibenay also traded in hide armor, moon sugar, and ancestor-silk. Following the decline of the Alessian Empire, the Colovian West and Nibenean East were seperated. The Heartlands and Nibenean Valley are considered the breadbasket of Cyrodiil. Colovia being largely unimportant, excluding Skingrad, which is famous for its wines and tomatoes. Poor farming is done in Colovia, with isolated farms and settlements dotting the land, as most of the population lives near the coast.\nThe people of Nibenay are seen as the soul of Cyrodiil, being famous for their kindness towards defeated enemies, tolerance, and administrative capabilities. Within the Nibenay Valley the Cyro-Nordic tribes learned a self-reliance which managed to seperate them both culturally and economically from Skyrim. The Nibenese around this time also formed a support troop for their armies, the Battlemage. When the Alessian Doctrines had come to pass, these Battlemages became the ruling body of the Nibenese, but were quickly replaced by the Alessian Priesthood. The Eight Divines were put aside in favor of ancestor spirits and animal gods, which were encouraged by the Alessian faith. Nibenean culture would adapt to this religious reform greatly, resulting in restrictions on certain kinds of meat, alongside the increasing sentiment for animal cults, made agriculture and husbandry nearly impossible in the east. As such, many of eastern Cyrodiil became merchants, over time allowing their lands to become the wealthiest of Cyrodiil. Even so, the merchants were reminded the priesthood held the real power, being forced to pay many coins to the priesthood.\nThe people of Nibenay form the heart of the Empire, as well as its cultural center; but it is one that is fragile, and only held together by a strong Emperor. Nibeneans relish in costumes, tapestries, tattoos, brandings, and elaborate ceremony. They are more inclined to philosophy and the evolution of ancient traditions. They follow a number of cults; most famous are the &lt;a href=\"Cult%20of%20the%20Ancestor%20Moth\"&gt;Cult of the Ancestor Moth&lt;/a&gt;, the Cult of Heries, the Cult of Tiber Septim, and the &lt;a href=\"Cult%20of%20Emperor%20Zero\"&gt;Cult of Emperor Zero&lt;/a&gt;. Where as the Colovians shun these ways, the Nibeneans embrace them. Eastern Cyrodiil also prides itself in its Akaviri heritage, shown in various Akaviri dragon-motifs in their territory, from the Imperial City to remote villages. For their agriculture, the Nibenese use thousands of workers to ply the rice fields. Above the farmers are the merchant-nobility, then the temple priests and cult leaders, and yet above those is the aristocracy of the Battlemages. The highest power of Nibenean culture is granted to the Emperor.\nReligion.\nThe Imperial Pantheon is based upon the original &lt;a href=\"Eight%20Divines\"&gt;Eight Divines&lt;/a&gt; that later became the Nine Divines following the &lt;a href=\"Apotheosis%20%28Term%29\"&gt;apotheosis&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"Talos\"&gt;Talos&lt;/a&gt;. After the &lt;a href=\"Great%20War\"&gt;Great War&lt;/a&gt;, when Talos worship was outlawed, Imperial society largely returned to worship of the Eight Divines. Within the &lt;a href=\"Imperial%20Cult\"&gt;Imperial Cult&lt;/a&gt;, people looked to the Divines for the proper way of living a good life, with each Divine representing a different aspect of life. The Cult follows many doctrines, but their simplest is to help and protect one another. The Cult considers it the duty of the strong and wealthy to bear responsibility for helping and protecting others. The first duty is to look after members of the Cult, but after that, one is tasked with helping and protecting any needy person. While there once were differences between Colovians and Nibeneans in religious aspects, by the late-Third Era, all of Cyrodiil followed the Nine Divines. Foreign religions are tolerated within Imperial territory, even within the province of Cyrodiil itself. However, the priesthood within Cyrodiil considers the other gods to be heathen-gods.\nFollowing the Great War, the Empire was forced to outlaw the worship of Talos as part of the terms of the &lt;a href=\"White-Gold%20Concordat\"&gt;White-Gold Concordat&lt;/a&gt;. After the &lt;a href=\"Markarth%20Incident\"&gt;Markarth Incident&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"Thalmor\"&gt;Thalmor&lt;/a&gt; demanded access to &lt;a href=\"Skyrim\"&gt;Skyrim&lt;/a&gt; to enforce the Concordat, as the Empire had broken treaty terms by accepting free Talos worship during said Incident. &lt;a href=\"Ulfric%20Stormcloak\"&gt;Ulfric Stormcloak&lt;/a&gt;, who had collaborated with the Thalmor during the Incident, was also imprisoned by them during this event. When Ulfric was released and became the Jarl of &lt;a href=\"Windhelm\"&gt;Windhelm&lt;/a&gt;, he started his &lt;a href=\"Stormcloaks\"&gt;rebellion&lt;/a&gt;. Ulfric would use the ban on Talos worship as his rallying cry, and gain a number of supporters by doing so.\nMilitary.\nImperials on their own are less physically imposing than some of the other races of Tamriel. Despite this, their Legions are considered mighty, having enabled the Imperials to subdue multiple societies of Tamriel throughout history and create an their own empires of peace and prosperity. Most of the Imperial army consists of Colovians, who pride themselves in service of the Legions if a strong Emperor sits on the throne. Many Colovians take up positions in the army and navy, being posted as officers and soldiers, and even governors due to their loyalty to the Emperor. The Imperial Battlemages were dominated by the Nibeneans due to the cultural split between east and west Cyrodiil.\nThe Legions have been involved in many wars, such as the &lt;a href=\"War%20of%20the%20Red%20Diamond\"&gt;War of the Red Diamond&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"War%20of%20the%20Isle\"&gt;War of the Isle&lt;/a&gt;, and the Imperial Invasion of Akavir. After many wars were waged closely together, the Legion became greatly weakened. The Dominion took advantage of this and attacked the Empire, effectively conquering most of Colovia and southern Hammerfell. The Legion was tested to their limits during the Great War. The Emperor at the time, &lt;a href=\"Titus%20Mede%20II\"&gt;Titus Mede II&lt;/a&gt;, eventually signed the &lt;a href=\"White-Gold%20Concordat\"&gt;White-Gold Concordat&lt;/a&gt;, ending the conflict. After years of fighting, it was meant to provide him with the time needed to rebuild his armies, since a continuation of the war would have resulted in the Empire being completely destroyed. Since then, the Empire has been rebuilding its armies, and has put up garrisons on the border with the Dominion."}

In , if they are not part of the &lt;a href=\"Imperial%20Legion%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Imperial Legion&lt;/a&gt;, they typically serve as diplomats, &lt;a href=\"Merchants%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;traders&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"steward\"&gt;steward&lt;/a&gt;s, and craftsmen \u2014 which is well-suited, since Imperials are renowned for their diplomatic skills and cosmopolitan ideology.\nThe phrase \"Imperial Race\" is a bit of a misnomer. The people of &lt;a href=\"Cyrodiil\"&gt;Cyrodiil&lt;/a&gt; are divided into two ethno-cultural groups: &lt;a href=\"Nibenean\"&gt;Nibenean&lt;/a&gt;s and &lt;a href=\"Colovian\"&gt;Colovian&lt;/a&gt;s. Both descend from the native &lt;a href=\"Nedic\"&gt;Nedic&lt;/a&gt; and Cyro-Nordic peoples that were enslaved by the &lt;a href=\"Ayleid\"&gt;Ayleid&lt;/a&gt;s, but diverged a bit after consecutive invasions and interactions with other races. Colovian Imperials in Western Cyrodiil are more Nordic, sharing similar beliefs such as a heavy martial and seafaring tradition. Nibeneans have an &lt;a href=\"Akaviri\"&gt;Akaviri&lt;/a&gt; and, to a lesser degree, &lt;a href=\"Mer\"&gt;elven&lt;/a&gt; heritage. They have a greater appreciation for magic, art, commerce, and spirituality, in spite of being staunchly loyal to &lt;a href=\"Alessian%20Empire\"&gt;Alessian&lt;/a&gt; traditions. Both groups reflect the Empire's culture \u2014 a hybrid of Nordic, &lt;a href=\"Aldmer\"&gt;Aldmer&lt;/a&gt;i, and Akaviri culture.\nCharacter creation.\nStarting spells.\nThe starting spells in \"Skyrim\" are more important than they were in previous games, as the only way to learn additional &lt;a href=\"Spells%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;spells&lt;/a&gt; is to find &lt;a href=\"Spell%20Tomes%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;spell tomes&lt;/a&gt; or buy them from &lt;a href=\"Merchants%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;merchants&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"Court%20Wizard\"&gt;court mages&lt;/a&gt;. The Flames spell, which produces a continuous stream of fire when cast, is a starting spell for all races, as is Healing.\nPopular usage.\nDue to their broad &lt;a href=\"Skills%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;skill set&lt;/a&gt;, Imperials are ideal for custom classes. Their versatility leaves them highly customizable and efficient at &lt;a href=\"Classes%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;cross-classes&lt;/a&gt;, such as &lt;a href=\"battlemage\"&gt;battlemage&lt;/a&gt;s and &lt;a href=\"Crusader%20%28Class%29\"&gt;crusaders&lt;/a&gt;. In particular, they excel when playing as a paladin/templar due to their high base restoration skill and bonuses in heavy armor and one-handed. Their Voice of the Emperor ability allows them to calm a humanoid target, giving them the opportunity to retreat and recover. This time can be used to prepare for when the spell eventually wears off and the hostilities resume. Those skilled in the Sneak skill can take advantage of pacified targets in order to stealthily attack and kill their foes. They also find more gold coins than any other race, making them efficient thieves.\nNaming conventions.\nImperial characters often have Latin names. Examples include, Sorex Vinius, Tullius, Camilla Valerius, Cicero, etc., keeping with the overall Roman characteristics. However, starting with \"Skyrim\", some Imperial names start to sound more Italian than Latin such as Viola Giordano, Severio Pelagia, Marcurio or Vittoria Vici, reflecting the change in language over time."}

We know \u201cPrince Hew\" as a comic figure, share tales of his thick-headed approach to impossible problems, and jest about his aggressive opulence. A shrine to &lt;a href=\"Zeht\"&gt;Zeht&lt;/a&gt; floods as a sign of the god's displeasure? Build a more extravagant one further downstream! An oft-repeated &lt;a href=\"Taneth\"&gt;Taneth&lt;/a&gt; expression for wasting money is \u201claying foundation with Hubalajad's coin.\"\nYet, what is truly known of the Luckless Prince? The only references available are third-hand documents, at best. The many apocryphal tales muddy the issue, drawing us further and further away from the actual man. Therefore, we must look to the land of &lt;a href=\"Hew%27s%20Bane\"&gt;Hew's Bane&lt;/a&gt; itself to draw our own conclusions. What if, for only a moment, we approach what are commonly accepted as his many failures on their own terms?\nWe know Hubalajad must have arrived in the barren land of what was then called \u201cKhefrem's Boot\" with a sizable amount of soldiers and artisans. Without local quarries, and with no reliable overland route from the north, they needed to import a mass amount of cut stone by sea. The natural protected harbor in what would become &lt;a href=\"Abah%27s%20Landing\"&gt;Abah's Landing&lt;/a&gt; was undoubtedly their first stop. A steady flow of laden barges would prove tempting to pirates, so Hubalajad's first necessity was to construct No Shira Citadel, an imposing fortress overlooking the Abecean.\nIt is true No Shira was soon undermined by seasonal flooding. But in response, Hubalajad appealed to Zeht with a shrine. When subsequent flooding washed out the first shrine, he did order the construction of another, yet more elaborate shrine\u2014but from an examination of the stonework, the new one was upstream of the last. Seen in this light, \u201cPrince Hew's thick-headedness\" was in fact persistent resolve. Appealing to the Yokudan god of agriculture is not the act of an arrogant or thoughtless man.\nAll the while, Abah's Landing grew from a soldier's camp and shantytown to a sprawling city. Despite the many hardships of this frontier life, Hubalajad constructed a great palace\u2014a symbol that this land was his home, and that he was just as committed as the locals to thriving. Stone went to the great walls of Abah's Landing, showing that its contents deserved as much protection as the Yokudan ships.\nFor a moment I ask you to set aside the multiple tombs, the impressive Princes Gate that opened a northern passage to Ra Gada territory, and the Yokudan statue just south of the Abah's Landing harbor that most erroneously believe was an idealized image of Hubalajad himself. The very act of constructing a citadel and a walled city at the same time, with the same pool of resources, would require a sharp mind for logistical matters. If it was not Hubalajad himself, he knew enough to surround himself with someone who could. This is hardly the style of a witless buffoon.\nThe scale of Hubalajad's setbacks do not, in this author's opinion, justify the tales of endless folly. Was it a whispering campaign from jealous rivals who decried the resources he poured into an inhospitable land? A blemished reputation for not recognizing his half-uncle was a &lt;a href=\"necromancer\"&gt;necromancer&lt;/a&gt;? Did he invoke the ire of a Yokudan god, or perhaps a &lt;a href=\"Daedric%20Prince\"&gt;Daedric Prince&lt;/a&gt;? Though we may never truly know, we should keep one thing in mind about Hubalajad: before his arrival, no &lt;a href=\"Men\"&gt;Man&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"Mer\"&gt;Mer&lt;/a&gt; left a mark on this land. Today, the only structures surviving two millennia were those constructed by \u201cPrince Hew.\""}

The &lt;a href=\"Last%20Dragonborn\"&gt;Dragonborn&lt;/a&gt; encounters some &lt;a href=\"Alik%27r\"&gt;Alik'r&lt;/a&gt; warriors in search of a &lt;a href=\"Saadia\"&gt;Redguard woman&lt;/a&gt;. They must choose whether to believe the warriors, and return the woman to custody, or trust the fugitive, and kill her pursuers. Either option offers a decent monetary reward.\nBackground.\n\"A group of men calling themselves the Alik'r are looking for a Redguard woman in Whiterun.\"\nWalkthrough.\nAt any time after starting the main quest \"&lt;a href=\"Dragon%20Rising\"&gt;Dragon Rising&lt;/a&gt;,\" the Dragonborn will encounter &lt;a href=\"Alik%27r%20Warrior\"&gt;Alik'r Warrior&lt;/a&gt;s on the roads of &lt;a href=\"Skyrim\"&gt;Skyrim&lt;/a&gt; or at the entrance to Whiterun, arguing with the town guard for entry to the city. When asked, they will explain that they are searching for a &lt;a href=\"Saadia\"&gt;Redguard woman&lt;/a&gt;, who is a refugee from &lt;a href=\"Hammerfell\"&gt;Hammerfell&lt;/a&gt;. When asked why they are searching for her, they will refuse to answer. Since they are not welcome in Whiterun due to a prior incident with the guards, they will tell the Dragonborn to bring any news of their quarry to &lt;a href=\"Rorikstead\"&gt;Rorikstead&lt;/a&gt;.\nThere is no marker that leads to the Redguard woman that the Alik'r are looking for. If the Dragonborn searches Whiterun, they will eventually find her, a woman named &lt;a href=\"Saadia\"&gt;Saadia&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"The%20Bannered%20Mare\"&gt;The Bannered Mare&lt;/a&gt;.\nIf the Dragonborn tells Saadia about the two Alik'r Warriors looking for her, she becomes agitated and asks to speak privately. At this point, the Dragonborn can follow Saadia and speak with her privately or head back to the Alik'r at Rorikstead and inform them of her location. Speaking to the Alik'r ends the quests and earns the 500 reward.\nSaadia's Story.\nOnce Saadia is alone with the Dragonborn, she will explain her side of the situation. She currently works for &lt;a href=\"Hulda\"&gt;Hulda&lt;/a&gt; at the Bannered Mare, but claims she is a noblewoman of the province of Hammerfell, &lt;a href=\"House%20Suda\"&gt;House Suda&lt;/a&gt;, and her real name is Iman. According to claims, Saadia was forced to flee the province to &lt;a href=\"Skyrim\"&gt;Skyrim&lt;/a&gt; after speaking out against the &lt;a href=\"Aldmeri%20Dominion%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Aldmeri Dominion&lt;/a&gt;, who then hired the Alik'r to hunt her down and assassinate her. She denies Kematu's accusations of her selling out her people to the Thalmor and of her being a traitor to the empire. She says that if &lt;a href=\"Kematu\"&gt;Kematu&lt;/a&gt; were killed the rest of the assassins would scatter. If the Dragonborn promises to help her, she also mentions an &lt;a href=\"Alik%27r%20Prisoner\"&gt;Alik'r Prisoner&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;a href=\"Dragonsreach%20Dungeon\"&gt;Dragonsreach Dungeon&lt;/a&gt; who could help in locating Kematu. If Swindler's Den has been cleared prior to the quest, a dialogue option with Saadia will come up stating that Kematu's location is already known, thus avoiding the conversation with the Alik'r prisoner.\nOnce inside the Dungeon (one entrance is on the eastern wall of Dragonsreach), the Dragonborn can speak to the prisoner through the bars. He agrees to help if his bail of 100 is paid. This can be done by talking to one of the &lt;a href=\"Hold%20Guard\"&gt;guards&lt;/a&gt;. Talk to the prisoner again, and tell him his fine has been paid, and he will reveal that Kematu is in a cave called Swindler's Den. The guard then takes his time releasing him.\nSwindler's Den.\nSwindler's Den can be found due west of Whiterun at the base of a rocky hill in the middle of the plains. Kematu is guarded by several bandits, who must be defeated regardless of whose side is chosen (Saadia's or Kematu's).\nWhen the Dragonborn reaches Kematu, he does not attack on sight, allowing the Dragonborn to speak to him. &lt;a href=\"Kematu\"&gt;Kematu&lt;/a&gt; gives his side of the story, claiming that Saadia betrayed Hammerfell, and that as a result, the Redguard city of &lt;a href=\"Taneth\"&gt;Taneth&lt;/a&gt; fell during the war against the &lt;a href=\"Third%20Aldmeri%20Dominion\"&gt;Aldmeri Dominion&lt;/a&gt;. He explains that the Redguard houses wish to bring her back alive to face justice.\nSiding with Saadia.\nTo save &lt;a href=\"Saadia\"&gt;Saadia&lt;/a&gt; from capture, simply kill Kematu. After the battle, return to the Bannered Mare in Whiterun and inform Saadia. She will offer a reward of 500 .\nSiding with the Alik'r.\nWhen asked what he wants the Dragonborn to do, Kematu requests that they return to Saadia and convince her to meet at the stables, where she will be ambushed and brought to justice.\nHead back to the Bannered Mare and lie to Saadia by telling her that the attempt to defeat all the Alik'r forces failed, that they are coming for her, and that there is a horse ready for her to escape on. Exit Whiterun with Saadia following, and head to the &lt;a href=\"Whiterun%20Stables\"&gt;Whiterun Stables&lt;/a&gt;. Kematu will appear and immobilize Saadia. Speak with him one final time to collect the reward of 500 .\nAlternatively, after talking to Saadia for the first time, you can skip most of the quest by simply finding the Alik'r warriors anywhere throughout Skyrim and telling them you know Saadia's whereabouts. By doing so, they will tell you to take her to the stables. Talk to Saadia and tell you will help her (lie), and she will start following you. You can either finish the quest by bringing Saadia to Kematu or by killing him, which is easier than in other locations as he will be by himself without any other Alik'r warriors nearby.\nDouble Agent.\nBefore collecting the reward from Kematu, the Dragonborn can attack and kill him instead. In doing so, the Dragonborn may avoid fighting Kematu's men. Saadia will be enraged about being led into a trap and comment that she should have been warned first, but she will then be thankful for being rid of her pursuers and offer a reward of 500 . Kematu's corpse can also be looted for an additional 100\u2013250 . Killing Kematu after collecting the reward from him will cause Saadia to wake up and attack with her dagger, forfeiting her reward.\nPlaying both sides.\nIt is possible to earn 1000 by collecting the reward from both Saadia and Kematu."}

To others, they will be nothing short of blasphemy. But I can't hold these thoughts to myself any longer. If I try, I fear my head will explode into a thousand pieces! And that, dear reader, is not something I wish to experience.\nFirst, I should tell you who I am and why I'm qualified to write about the virtues of the beautiful &lt;a href=\"Regent%20Cassipia\"&gt;Cassipia&lt;/a&gt;\u2014she who is called the Regent of Serpentine Stratagems and leader of the Scaled Court's forces in &lt;a href=\"Upper%20Craglorn\"&gt;Upper Craglorn&lt;/a&gt;.\nMy name is Little Leaf, and I have served my mistress since before we joined the &lt;a href=\"Scaled%20Court\"&gt;Scaled Court&lt;/a&gt;. I met Cassipia in &lt;a href=\"Auridon\"&gt;Auridon&lt;/a&gt;, where she was a high-ranking member of the &lt;a href=\"Mages%20Guild%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Mages Guild&lt;/a&gt;. She noticed me admiring her power and grace from afar, and she personally selected me to wait upon her every need. Since then, I have become her confidant and confessor, giving her a sounding board for her most intimate thoughts and musings. No one knows Cassipia better than I do, or believes in her the way I do\u2014with all my heart and soul.\nHow can I say such things when the Serpent is our lord and master? Oh, I believe in and revere the Serpent. I really do! He's the reason we joined the Scaled Court in the first place. But the Serpent doesn't command the Scaled Court from moment to moment. He isn't right beside me day and night. And, if I may be so bold, he isn't anywhere near as fair of face and fine of form as my beloved Cassipia.\nWho did as the Serpent asked and brought the &lt;a href=\"Iron%20Orcs\"&gt;Iron Orcs&lt;/a&gt; into our fold? Cassipia, of course. She follows the Serpent's orders, but always looks for ways to create opportunities and good fortune for herself and her followers.\nBut before you think me just an infatuated fool with her head in the clouds, let me tell you why Cassipia has risen so high within our ranks. Cassipia is ruthless. She's powerful and charismatic. And she knows what's best for the Scaled Court\u2014not like those bumbling fools that brought us the unfortunate setbacks we've suffered in &lt;a href=\"Lower%20Craglorn\"&gt;Lower Craglorn&lt;/a&gt;! Regent Cassipia was busy in Upper Craglorn while the Serpent's \"select\" were losing their hold on the lower portion of the region.\nSo, all praise &lt;a href=\"Regent%20Cassipia\"&gt;Regent Cassipia&lt;/a&gt;!

{"id": "890963", "revid": "32911304", "url": "https://elderscrolls.fandom.com/wiki?curid=890963", "title": "Elinhir", "text": "Elinhir is one of the nine major kingdoms located in &lt;a href=\"Hammerfell\"&gt;Hammerfell&lt;/a&gt; and is the capital of both the &lt;a href=\"Craglorn\"&gt;Craglorn&lt;/a&gt; region and the &lt;a href=\"Elinhir%20Region\"&gt;Proving Grounds&lt;/a&gt; region of Craglorn. Elinhir is the City of Mages that is the home of the &lt;a href=\"Blackcaster%20Mages%20Guild\"&gt;Blackcaster Mages Guild&lt;/a&gt;, one of the most powerful magic covens located in &lt;a href=\"Tamriel\"&gt;Tamriel&lt;/a&gt;, rivaling the likes of &lt;a href=\"the%20Synod\"&gt;the Synod&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"College%20of%20Winterhold\"&gt;College of Winterhold&lt;/a&gt;. Elinhir is noted as being part of Hammerfell's &lt;a href=\"The%20Crowns\"&gt;Crown&lt;/a&gt; faction.\nDescription.\nGeography.\nDespite being the capital of Craglorn, the city of Elinhir is located on the eastern edge of the region, just before the &lt;a href=\"Jerall%20Mountains\"&gt;Jerall Mountains&lt;/a&gt; in northern &lt;a href=\"Cyrodiil\"&gt;Cyrodiil&lt;/a&gt;. Since before its foundation, Elinhir has had an affinity with &lt;a href=\"Magicka\"&gt;Magicka&lt;/a&gt; and this has affected the city throughout the years, both good and bad. The city was built on the eastern river of Craglorn; other notable locations exist the river such as the border gate to Cyrodiil and the &lt;a href=\"Nedic\"&gt;Nedic&lt;/a&gt; tower called the &lt;a href=\"Aetherian%20Archive\"&gt;Aetherian Archive&lt;/a&gt;. Another river flows in Elinhir's southern district, which leads to a lake hidden in the &lt;a href=\"Dragontail%20Mountains\"&gt;Dragontail Mountains&lt;/a&gt;. Elinhir is perhaps one of the biggest cities in northern Hammerfell, that includes the &lt;a href=\"Kingdom%20of%20Sentinel\"&gt;Kingdom of Sentinel&lt;/a&gt; to the west and the northern borders of &lt;a href=\"Bangkorai\"&gt;Bangkorai&lt;/a&gt;.\nUnlike the other cities in Hammerfell, Elinhir was originally built by the &lt;a href=\"Nede\"&gt;Nede&lt;/a&gt;s, and it was one of the very few remnants of their culture that still exist to this day. The Nedes eventually faded away into obscurity by integrating with the other human &lt;a href=\"races\"&gt;races&lt;/a&gt; of Tamriel. The seat of power in Elinhir is the &lt;a href=\"Apex%20Tower\"&gt;Apex Tower&lt;/a&gt;, a large Nedic structure nestled in the southern cliffs in Elinhir. The tower is the biggest structure in Elinhir and can easily be spotted from a distance.\nHistory.\n&lt;a href=\"First%20Era\"&gt;First Era&lt;/a&gt;.\nDuring the &lt;a href=\"Alessian%20Reforms\"&gt;Alessian Reforms&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Ryain%20Direnni\"&gt;Ryain Direnni&lt;/a&gt; rebelled against the Alessians after &lt;a href=\"Rislav%20Larich\"&gt;Rislav Larich&lt;/a&gt; defeated &lt;a href=\"Emperor\"&gt;Emperor&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Gorieus\"&gt;Gorieus&lt;/a&gt; near the city of &lt;a href=\"Skingrad\"&gt;Skingrad&lt;/a&gt;. After the &lt;a href=\"Battle%20of%20Glenumbra%20Moors%20%28Event%29\"&gt;Battle of Glenumbra Moors&lt;/a&gt;, Ryain advanced through the &lt;a href=\"Iliac%20Bay\"&gt;Iliac Bay&lt;/a&gt; and eventually the &lt;a href=\"Dragontail%20Mountains\"&gt;Dragontail Mountains&lt;/a&gt; in Craglorn. Ryain was able to capture land from the westernmost point of &lt;a href=\"Greater%20Bretony\"&gt;Greater Bretony&lt;/a&gt; to the Kingdom of Elinhir and the Kingdom of Markarth. The city of &lt;a href=\"Orsinium\"&gt;Orsinium&lt;/a&gt; had been besieged by the &lt;a href=\"Direnni\"&gt;Direnni&lt;/a&gt; Elves around the same time as well.\n&lt;a href=\"Second%20Era\"&gt;Second Era&lt;/a&gt;.\nElinhir during the early years of the Second Era, was similar to the other settlements in Craglorn such as &lt;a href=\"Belkarth%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Belkarth&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Dragonstar\"&gt;Dragonstar&lt;/a&gt;. These towns were considered the wild and lawless backwater nations of Hammerfell, and it was settled by those unbefitting of the &lt;a href=\"Reman%20Empire\"&gt;Reman Empire&lt;/a&gt; and the kingdoms of Hammerfell. It was not until a man named &lt;a href=\"Felix%20Augustus\"&gt;Felix Augustus&lt;/a&gt; the Blackcaster and his group of mages arrived into Elinhir where the city actually flourished amidst the lawless reaches of Craglorn. According to folklore, the Blackcasters was a rebellious group of mages from the &lt;a href=\"Mages%20Guild\"&gt;Mages Guild&lt;/a&gt; that were almost as equal as the bandits in Craglorn.\nIn reality, Felix Augustus left the Mages Guild to expand the borders beyond the &lt;a href=\"Imperial%20Province\"&gt;Imperial Province&lt;/a&gt;, to expand the guild's reach into Craglorn. He would write letters to his guild mates in Cyrodiil to provide insight into his recent exploits. He eventually signed the &lt;a href=\"Apex%20Accord\"&gt;Apex Accord&lt;/a&gt; with the leaders of Elinhir, the purpose of the Apex Accord was to have the Blackcasters study the Nedic Apex Tower of Elinhir all the while they protect the city from invaders such as the &lt;a href=\"Iron%20Orcs\"&gt;Iron Orcs&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"Upper%20Craglorn\"&gt;Upper Craglorn&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Greycloak%20Bandits\"&gt;Greycloak Bandits&lt;/a&gt; of the &lt;a href=\"Belkarth%20Region\"&gt;Belkarth Region&lt;/a&gt;. The then mayor of Elinhir refused the proposal initially until the city was besieged by the Iron Orcs. The Blackcasters were able to drive them off with ease, and Augustus was named the new Mayor of Elinhir. The Apex Accord was signed, and the Blackcasters remained Elinhir's protectors for years.\nIn his youth, the future head of the &lt;a href=\"Ebonheart%20Pact\"&gt;Ebonheart Pact&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Jorunn%20the%20Skald-King\"&gt;Jorunn the Skald-King&lt;/a&gt;, traveled to many cities located in Tamriel to study the arts in his pursuit for his artistic and philosophical interests. The cities he has traveled to are Elinhir, &lt;a href=\"Mournhold\"&gt;Mournhold&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Sutch\"&gt;Sutch&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Stormhold\"&gt;Stormhold&lt;/a&gt;, and even &lt;a href=\"Solitude\"&gt;Solitude&lt;/a&gt; in the Kingdom of Western Skyrim. It was likely that Prince Jorunn went to the Blackcaster Academy to study the Elinhiran arts and practice in magic.\nDuring the &lt;a href=\"Interregnum\"&gt;Interregnum&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"2E%20582\"&gt;2E 582&lt;/a&gt;, the region of Craglorn was seeing an influx of Magicka that caused the people of Craglorn to spiral into a rage. The then leader of the &lt;a href=\"Blackcaster%20Mages%20Guild\"&gt;Blackcasters&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Yamanu-ko\"&gt;Yamanu-ko&lt;/a&gt; was being corrupted by the foul entity called &lt;a href=\"The%20Serpent%20%28Celestial%29\"&gt;the Serpent&lt;/a&gt;. Through her, the Serpent was able to corrupt the Blackcasters and use them to control his army of &lt;a href=\"Atronach\"&gt;Atronach&lt;/a&gt;s. The Blackcasters destroyed the city of Elinhir using the strongest form of &lt;a href=\"Shadow%20Magic\"&gt;Shadow Magic&lt;/a&gt; and raining it down upon the city's denizens. The remaining few fled the city and settled on the outskirts, looking up their once beautiful city, now a war zone unlike any other.\nA group of adventurers traveled to the city of Elinhir on their quest to defeat the Serpent and to bring peace in Craglorn. A citizen of Elinhir told the adventures of a resistance group located deep within the &lt;a href=\"Elinhir%20Sewerworks\"&gt;Elinhir Sewerworks&lt;/a&gt; and a planned assassination attempt on Yamanu-ko at the central Apex tower. The Sewers were infested with thralls to the Serpent called the &lt;a href=\"Spellfiend\"&gt;Spellfiend&lt;/a&gt;. The leader of the resistance, &lt;a href=\"Minerva%20Lauzon\"&gt;Minerva Lauzon&lt;/a&gt; traveled with the adventures to the twin apex towers to the east and west to disable the barrier protecting the central Apex tower. The two towers were guarded by Yamanu-ko's two apprentices, &lt;a href=\"Leta%20Doniticus\"&gt;Leta Doniticus&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Avys%20Areleth\"&gt;Avys Areleth&lt;/a&gt;. Both were defeated by the adventurers, and the soon traveled to the central Apex Tower. Yamanu-ko fought the heroes to the death, and she ultimately lost her life in the process. Elinhir was ravaged, and it took many months for it to rebuild.\n&lt;a href=\"Third%20Era\"&gt;Third Era&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe &lt;a href=\"War%20of%20Bend%27r-Mahk\"&gt;War of Bend'r-Mahk&lt;/a&gt; ravaged &lt;a href=\"the%20Reach\"&gt;the Reach&lt;/a&gt; from as far as northern &lt;a href=\"Wrothgar\"&gt;Wrothgar&lt;/a&gt; near the city of &lt;a href=\"Jehanna\"&gt;Jehanna&lt;/a&gt; to eastern Craglorn near the city of Elinhir. Resistance against the &lt;a href=\"Nord\"&gt;Nord&lt;/a&gt;ic invaders was slowly diminishing, and the fronts on both cities soon gave way. The war ended when a mysterious warrior called the &lt;a href=\"Soul%20of%20Conflict\"&gt;Soul of Conflict&lt;/a&gt; defeated a strange creature made of &lt;a href=\"Shadow%20Magic\"&gt;Shadow Magic&lt;/a&gt; called the &lt;a href=\"Umbra%27%20Keth\"&gt;Umbra' Keth&lt;/a&gt; at the &lt;a href=\"Crypt%20of%20Hearts\"&gt;Crypt of Hearts&lt;/a&gt;. The war was used by &lt;a href=\"Pergan%20Asuul\"&gt;Pergan Asuul&lt;/a&gt; to test the power of the Umbra' Keth and to use it for their own malicious purposes.\nDuring the &lt;a href=\"Imperial%20Simulacrum\"&gt;Imperial Simulacrum&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"3E%20399\"&gt;3E 399&lt;/a&gt;, the city of Elinhir was one of the eight kingdoms of Hammerfell, and it was under the rule of &lt;a href=\"Queen%20Fhimke-i\"&gt;Queen Fhimke-i&lt;/a&gt;. Elinhir was connected to several townships such as the towns of &lt;a href=\"Nimbel%20Moor\"&gt;Nimbel Moor&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Stonedale\"&gt;Stonedale&lt;/a&gt;, and the city of &lt;a href=\"Falcrenth\"&gt;Falcrenth&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Skyrim\"&gt;Skyrim&lt;/a&gt;. At one point, the &lt;a href=\"Eternal%20Champion\"&gt;Eternal Champion&lt;/a&gt; had visited the city in their quest for a piece of the &lt;a href=\"Staff%20of%20Chaos\"&gt;Staff of Chaos&lt;/a&gt; to defeat &lt;a href=\"Jagar%20Tharn\"&gt;Jagar Tharn&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;a href=\"Imperial%20Palace\"&gt;Imperial Palace&lt;/a&gt;.\nAround the time of the &lt;a href=\"Oblivion%20Crisis\"&gt;Oblivion Crisis&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"3E%20433\"&gt;3E 433&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"King%20Lhotun\"&gt;King Lhotun&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"Sentinel\"&gt;Sentinel&lt;/a&gt; underwent different political, militaristic, and religious mission to keep the regions across the &lt;a href=\"Alik%27r%20Desert\"&gt;Alik'r Desert&lt;/a&gt; under his wing. Many opposed his tyranny, and small forms of rebellion occurred throughout Hammerfell. The biggest revolution originated from the city of Elinhir when High Prophet &lt;a href=\"Ayaan-si\"&gt;Ayaan-si&lt;/a&gt; gathered high-ranking members of the True &lt;a href=\"the%20Crowns\"&gt;Crowns&lt;/a&gt; to fight against Lhotun's government called &lt;a href=\"Lhotunic\"&gt;Lhotunic&lt;/a&gt;. Ayaan-si's rebellion was able to free the &lt;a href=\"Fiefdom%20of%20Totambu\"&gt;Fiefdom of Totambu&lt;/a&gt; from Sentinel, and he established forays across the borders of &lt;a href=\"Bergama\"&gt;Bergama&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Dak%27fron%20Desert\"&gt;Dak'fron Desert&lt;/a&gt;. By the time the Oblivion Crisis officially occurred, the rebellion had reached the Totambu Fiefdom. The outcome is unknown, but it was likely halted by the invasion."}

As a reward, she will allow the Dragonborn to purchase property in &lt;a href=\"Solitude%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Solitude&lt;/a&gt; and advises them to assist the citizens of &lt;a href=\"Haafingar\"&gt;Haafingar&lt;/a&gt; so as to become the &lt;a href=\"Thane%20%28Title%29\"&gt;Thane&lt;/a&gt; of the hold."}

While Elisif is the head of court at her palace in &lt;a href=\"Solitude%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Solitude&lt;/a&gt;, the provincial capital of Skyrim as a whole alongside being the hold capital of Haafingar, the majority of her courtly duties are handled by her &lt;a href=\"steward\"&gt;steward&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Falk%20Firebeard\"&gt;Falk Firebeard&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href=\"Bolgeir%20Bearclaw\"&gt;Bolgeir Bearclaw&lt;/a&gt; serves as her &lt;a href=\"Housecarl\"&gt;Housecarl&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Sybille%20Stentor\"&gt;Sybille Stentor&lt;/a&gt; is her &lt;a href=\"Court%20Wizard\"&gt;Court Wizard&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Bryling\"&gt;Bryling&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Erikur\"&gt;Erikur&lt;/a&gt; serve as her &lt;a href=\"Thane%20%28Title%29\"&gt;Thanes&lt;/a&gt;.\nLocation.\nElisif can be found in the &lt;a href=\"Blue%20Palace%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Blue Palace&lt;/a&gt; located in the southeast of Solitude. The palace stands directly across and down the street from &lt;a href=\"Castle%20Dour%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Castle Dour&lt;/a&gt;, the headquarters of the &lt;a href=\"Imperial%20Legion%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Imperial military forces&lt;/a&gt; in Skyrim. Elisif rarely leaves the palace for fears she will be attacked by a Stormcloak Assassin, doing so only for rare occasions such as the wedding between &lt;a href=\"Vittoria%20Vici\"&gt;Vittoria Vici&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Asgeir%20Snow-Shod\"&gt;Asgeir Snow-Shod&lt;/a&gt;.\nBackground.\nElisif was the wife of Torygg, the High King of Skyrim prior to the &lt;a href=\"Skyrim%20Civil%20War\"&gt;Skyrim Civil War&lt;/a&gt;. Elisif and Torygg were in a happy marriage, wanting to enjoy themselves at parties such as the one at the &lt;a href=\"Thalmor%20Embassy%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Thalmor Embassy&lt;/a&gt; and were affectionate to each other. Torygg was loyal to the Empire, agreeing to the &lt;a href=\"White-Gold%20Concordat\"&gt;White-Gold Concordat&lt;/a&gt; and enforcing it, though this caused issue amongst some of his subjects. It is unknown how Elisif felt about such matters, although since she does not worship Talos\u2014unlike her husband\u2014she was likely unaffected by the treaty.\nWidowed.\nFollowing the killing of Torygg at the hand of &lt;a href=\"Ulfric%20Stormcloak%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Ulfric Stormcloak&lt;/a&gt;, Elisif was left grieving for her husband as she became the Jarl of Haafingar Hold. Following her assumption to power in Solitude, Elisif began to work in close cooperation with the &lt;a href=\"Third%20Empire\"&gt;Third Empire&lt;/a&gt; against Ulfric Stormcloak and the &lt;a href=\"Stormcloak\"&gt;Stormcloak&lt;/a&gt; Rebellion. Elisif's support of the Empire can be traced to several factors, with the largest being her anger at Ulfric for the killing of Torygg; like many in Solitude, she believed this was murder. In addition to this, her husband willingly served under &lt;a href=\"Titus%20Mede%20II\"&gt;the Emperor&lt;/a&gt;, and although he might have considered an independent Skyrim, he was still subservient to the Empire until he died. The Empire also supports her to be the High Queen of Skyrim, seeing her as the successor to her husband.\nSkyrim Civil War.\nDue to her support, Solitude serves as the base of Imperial military power in Skyrim during the Civil War; &lt;a href=\"General%20Tullius%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;General Tullius&lt;/a&gt; works closely with Jarl Elisif in his attempts to squash the Stormcloak Rebellion. Elisif has faith in Tullius and trusts him a great deal, to the joy of some in court and to the dismay of others. She also wants to be in the loop more often and commonly asks Falk to set up meetings between them. This Imperial support, along with Elisif's marriage to the last High King, makes Elisif the most likely candidate for the position of monarch should the Empire succeed in ending the Stormcloak Rebellion. Elisif herself supports such a decision, going so far as to call it her \"rightful place\" while also not rushing to claim such a title until the war is over. However, Elisif's lack of experience and total dependence on Imperial support\u2014specifically with regards to &lt;a href=\"General%20Tullius%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;General Tullius&lt;/a&gt;\u2014implies that Elisif will be greatly under the control of the Empire as High Queen of Skyrim, similarly to her husband under the Emperor.\nPersonality.\nElisif is sensitive to the death of her husband and is still mourning his loss. His death overshadows much of what she does, with her banning festivals such as the Burning of King Olaf by the Bards College as a result of this. Even in happy occasions, such as the wedding between Vittoria and Asgeir, she is a bit tense; when Vittoria dies, Elisif can only think of Torygg. When not overshadowed by Torygg's demise, Elisif's demeanor is rather positive to those around her, and she has decent patience for disagreement and for what people say about her.\nReign as Jarl.\nElisif is young and inexperienced, relying on Falk Firebeard to see to many of her duties. She is very receptive to the advice of her court, commonly asking her thanes for their opinion and usually listening to them. Elisif has little confidence in her abilities, and as a result, she is very impressionable. Elisif also still mourns for her husband, and thanks to this, her lack of confidence, and her rather amateur ruling skills, some in Solitude see her as an ineffectual ruler. Ulfric merely refers to her as \"Torygg's woman\" and goes so far to say she is a \"pet jarl,\" clearly seeing her as nothing more than a pawn for the Empire. Despite all this, she does retain some respect, such as from Tullius, Falk, and Beirand. Falk Firebeard has even gone so far as to attempt to teach Elisif in the ways of statecraft, giving advice on politics as a whole. \nStormcloak Rebellion.\nAn outspoken supporter of the Empire, Elisif is a Jarl whose court views are to keep Skyrim as a province of the Empire of Tamriel. Viewing the Stormcloak Rebellion as a blight upon the face of Skyrim, Elisif gives no explicit indication of any dissatisfaction with the Empire outside of wanting to speak with General Tullius more often. Elisif sees the war as a top priority, following Tullius's directives and submitting all resources she has to in order to defeat the Stormcloaks.\nTalos worship.\nWith regard to religious views, Elisif states that she does not worship &lt;a href=\"Talos\"&gt;Talos&lt;/a&gt;, thus it is unknown how she feels about the White-Gold Concordat. However, she nonetheless asks the &lt;a href=\"Last%20Dragonborn\"&gt;Dragonborn&lt;/a&gt; to deliver &lt;a href=\"Torygg%27s%20War%20Horn\"&gt;Torygg's War Horn&lt;/a&gt; to a &lt;a href=\"Shrine%20of%20Talos\"&gt;Shrine of Talos&lt;/a&gt; near &lt;a href=\"Whiterun%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Whiterun&lt;/a&gt; so that her late husband might have the funerary rites which he would have wanted, for High King Torygg was a worshipper of Talos even if she wasn't.\nStormcloak victory.\nIf the Dragonborn sides with the Stormcloaks during the &lt;a href=\"Civil%20War\"&gt;Civil War&lt;/a&gt; and captures Solitude, killing General Tullius and &lt;a href=\"Legate%20Rikke%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Legate Rikke&lt;/a&gt;, Elisif agrees to swear fealty to Ulfric Stormcloak with little resistance, but whether she does so out of personal interest or militaristic coercion is not entirely clear. In any case, tension persists in Solitude under Stormcloak rule, and Ulfric's choice to garrison a number of his Stormcloaks in Solitude, following a Stormcloak victory, seems to imply that Elisif will only act as the Jarl of Solitude as far as Ulfric allows. She also holds no anger against the Dragonborn personally, rather regret that she has lost her claim to the throne.\nInteractions.\n&lt;a href=\"Diplomatic%20Immunity\"&gt;Diplomatic Immunity&lt;/a&gt;.\nElisif is present at the Thalmor Embassy and can be asked to create a distraction if \"&lt;a href=\"The%20Man%20Who%20Cried%20Wolf\"&gt;The Man Who Cried Wolf&lt;/a&gt;\" was already completed. In doing so, she will accuse &lt;a href=\"Razelan\"&gt;Razelan&lt;/a&gt; of defying her authority, believing that the Dragonborn asked for the distraction as a joke to someone else.\n&lt;a href=\"Season%20Unending\"&gt;Season Unending&lt;/a&gt;.\nElisif joins the Imperial side during the negotiations, representing herself as the claimant for the throne of Skyrim. Elisif is quick to call out Ulfric's demands despite this being a peace council, though Tullius quiets her as negotiations officially begin. Elisif is largely quite otherwise until the end, where Ulfric taunts her about being an Imperial pawn. Elisif ignores him and reaffirms her devotion to The Empire.\n&lt;a href=\"The%20Jagged%20Crown%20%28Quest%29\"&gt;The Jagged Crown&lt;/a&gt;.\nGeneral Tullius and Legate Rikke decide to fetch the &lt;a href=\"The%20Jagged%20Crown%20%28Item%29\"&gt;The Jagged Crown&lt;/a&gt; from &lt;a href=\"Korvanjund\"&gt;Korvanjund&lt;/a&gt; in order to further legitimize Elisif's claim to being High Queen. Depending on the Dragonborn's chosen faction in the Civil War, the efforts will either succeed (if the Dragonborn is a legionnaire) or fail (if the Dragonborn is a Stormcloak). \n&lt;a href=\"Battle%20for%20Solitude\"&gt;Battle for Solitude&lt;/a&gt;.\nSolitude is assaulted by the Stormcloaks, led personally by Ulfric Stormcloak and &lt;a href=\"Galmar%20Stone-Fist\"&gt;Galmar Stone-Fist&lt;/a&gt;, although their target is Castle Dour rather than the Blue Palace. After the death of Tullius and Rikke, Galmar sends his best men to bring her to Ulfric's speech, where the soldiers question what is to be done with her. Ulfric demands that she swear loyalty to him, and after she does, he declares that he will let her remain as Jarl of Haafingar, though he will also garrison Stormcloaks there to prevent Imperial insurrection. Elisif then witnesses the rest of the speech alongside the other soldiers, eventually returning to the Blue Palace and admitting that she will have to support Ulfric at the &lt;a href=\"Moot\"&gt;Moot&lt;/a&gt;.\n&lt;a href=\"Bound%20Until%20Death\"&gt;Bound Until Death&lt;/a&gt;.\nElisif can be found attending the public reception of the wedding of &lt;a href=\"Vittoria%20Vici\"&gt;Vittoria Vici&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Asgeir%20Snow-Shod\"&gt;Asgeir Snow-Shod&lt;/a&gt; at the &lt;a href=\"Temple%20of%20the%20Divines%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Temple of the Divines&lt;/a&gt; in Solitude. Like the others, she will be horrified when Vittoria is murdered, but won't retaliate like the &lt;a href=\"Snow-Shod\"&gt;Snow-Shod&lt;/a&gt;s if the &lt;a href=\"Last%20Dragonborn\"&gt;Dragonborn&lt;/a&gt; is discovered or &lt;a href=\"Veezara\"&gt;Veezara&lt;/a&gt; appears to deal with Vittoria's &lt;a href=\"Penitus%20Oculatus%20Agent%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Penitus Oculatus&lt;/a&gt; bodyguard, opting to flee instead. Asgeir's death only reminds her of the recent murder of her own husband by Ulfric.\n&lt;a href=\"Elisif%27s%20Tribute\"&gt;Elisif's Tribute&lt;/a&gt;.\nIn order to pay her final respects to the gods, Elisif entrusts the Dragonborn with Torygg's War Horn and tasks them to take it to a &lt;a href=\"White%20River%20Valley\"&gt;remote shrine of Talos&lt;/a&gt;.\n&lt;a href=\"Thane%20of%20Haafingar\"&gt;Thane of Haafingar&lt;/a&gt;.\nThere is room for another Thane in the court, but before Elisif can give the Dragonborn this title they must be known throughout the hold. Once known among the people of Haafingar and purchasing &lt;a href=\"Proudspire%20Manor%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Proudspire Manor&lt;/a&gt; as their new home in Solitude from Falk, Elisif will be able to proclaim the Dragonborn Thane of Solitude, awarding them the &lt;a href=\"Blade%20of%20Haafingar\"&gt;Blade of Haafingar&lt;/a&gt;.\n&lt;a href=\"Tending%20the%20Flames\"&gt;Tending the Flames&lt;/a&gt;.\nElisif forbids the Burning of King Olaf, a locally celebrated festival which involves the burning of an effigy, because the death of her husband has left her sensitive to this type of public defamation. &lt;a href=\"Viarmo\"&gt;Viarmo&lt;/a&gt; desires the festival to be reinstated and has The Dragonborn retrieve \"&lt;a href=\"King%20Olaf%27s%20Verse\"&gt;King Olaf's Verse&lt;/a&gt;\". After finding that the verse is heavily degraded, the two craft a completed version of the verse and attend an audience with Elisif. After hearing the \"truth\" about &lt;a href=\"Olaf%20One-Eye\"&gt;King Olaf&lt;/a&gt;, Elisif is impressed, reinstating the festival and rewarding the &lt;a href=\"Bards%20College%20%28Skyrim%20Faction%29\"&gt;Bards College&lt;/a&gt; with a sum of money determinant on how convincing the verse was.\n&lt;a href=\"Fit%20for%20a%20Jarl\"&gt;Fit for a Jarl&lt;/a&gt;.\n&lt;a href=\"Taarie%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Taarie&lt;/a&gt;, a tailor at &lt;a href=\"Radiant%20Raiment%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Radiant Raiment&lt;/a&gt; in Solitude, sends the Dragonborn to Elisif, sporting one of their many outfits. The Dragonborn is tasked with receiving Elisif's opinion on the clothes. She receives the garments well, ordering the Dragonborn to return with promises of purchasing several gowns from the tailors in the future.\nDialogue.\n\"If you have business, please see Falk Firebeard, my steward.\"\n\"There's something... personal... I was hoping you would do for me.\"\nAfter placing the horn:\nI've placed the horn at the shrine. \"Falk said I could count on you. You have more than earned the right to purchase property and take the next step to becoming a Thane. Speak to Falk when you have the funds. And thank you.\"\n\"May the blessings of the Nine be with you.\"\n\"A marriage of both love and political advantage. A rare thing indeed.\"\n\"Isn't this something? Elenwen really knows how to host a party!\"\n\"It was a pleasure, thank you.\"\nCut dialogue.\nIf the Dragonborn approaches Elisif's room prior to speaking with Falk Firebeard, spoken through the door:\nIf the Dragonborn has spoken to Falk Firebeard, they will then be taken to Elisif's chambers with him, where the following scene will take place outside her room:\nFalk Firebeard: \"Elisif...\"\nElisif the Fair: \"Go. Away. Please!\"\nFalk: \"I've brought a friend. Someone who can help. A bodyguard. To protect you.\"\nElisif: \"I thought you didn't believe I was in danger!\"\nFalk: \"It doesn't really matter what I believe, now does it? I've brought you someone who can protect you. That's what you want, isn't it?\"\nElisif: \"(Sounds of unlocking and unbarring a door) Well, what are you waiting for?!\"\nAfter opening the door, Elisif will hurriedly shout, \"Come in, come in! Shut the door behind you!\" When the Dragonborn approaches her, she will say the following:\n\"I'm glad they finally believed me. About the assassin I mean. It's been so hard since my Torygg passed. No one takes me seriously. So how's this work exactly? Do you just kind of stand there on the look out? That's what Bolgeir does. Well, he sort of looms more than stands. Bolgeir's loyal, but even he doesn't do what I ask. Case in point, this whole assassin thing. Well at least I have you now. Look at me ramble... Well, I guess I'll go about my business sulking in here. You can stand over there in the corner watching for assassins.\"\nAfter attacking Elisif, she will scream, \"Help! Assassin!\"\nConversations.\nElisif: \"Steward, I have an idea that might help to bolster the morale of our people in this difficult time. I think we shall have a grand parade, and let General Tullius march his troops from the Blue Palace to Castle Dour in all their finery.\"\nFalk: \"What a... fine idea, my Jarl. However, I would suggest we wait until the war has ended. After all, the General needs his soldiers out in the field, fighting battles against the Stormcloaks.\"\nBolgeir: \"I must protest, my Jarl. A parade would make you an easy target for a Stormcloak assassin. You're safer here in the palace.\"\nElisif: \"Oh, very well. I can see there's no changing your stubborn Nord minds. But when this war is won, I will have my parade!\"\nFalk: \"Yes, my Jarl.\"\nBolgeir: \"We lost another five guardsmen, my Jarl. If General Tullius continues to conscript our men and send them off to battle, we'll have none left to protect the city.\"\nElisif: \"Yes, I know. The general acted with my blessing. It is vital that we bring Ulfric to justice, but that cannot happen until his army of Stormcloaks is defeated utterly.\"\nBolgeir: \"Told you that, did he? I'm sworn to protect you, my Jarl, but I'm the last line of defense. The first line is the walls around this city and the men who patrol them. Men whom, I might add, we're precious short on.\"\nElisif: \"I'm aware of that, Bolgeir, and I appreciate your dedication. However, if we lose the war, the guardsmen of Solitude will make little difference in the end.\"\nBolgeir: \"No disrespect toward the general, but sometimes I wonder if he's got your best interests at heart. In any case he won't be turnin' me into no Imperial soldier. I know my place, and it's at your side.\"\nElisif: \"It comforts me to know that, Bolgeir.\"\nElisif: \"As you know, Solitude's coffers are much depleted by the war efforts. Thane Erikur, you have a strong head for business. What do you suggest?\"\nErikur: \"This is an unfortunate but unavoidable ebb in revenue. But as long as we continue to support the Empire, our sacrifices will be well rewarded.\"\nBryling: \"Listen to you, speaking of sacrifice. You've never gone hungry a day in your life, Erikur!\"\nElisif: \"And what would my impetuous Thane Bryling suggest, instead?\"\nBryling: \"Simple. Let the Empire fight its own war, with its own funds, and without hijacking our supplies and soldiers. Let Haafingar rebuild.\"\nErikur: \"My lady... Surely you're not that na\u00efve. Such foolishness would only leave us defenseless. The rebels would storm the palace in an afternoon.\"\nBryling: \"\"The Stormcloaks only rebel because the Empire uses Skyrim as its personal larder. The more they take, the more support the rebels gain!\nElisif: \"That is quite enough. Perhaps I will raise these issues when I have an audience with General Tullius.\"\nElisif: \"Thane Bryling, what do you have to report about the state of Haafingar's defenses?\"\nBryling: \"The news is the same as it's been for the rest of the war, your grace. Our borders are secure, but at the cost of the guards for our towns and roads.\"\nErikur: \"I don't see any reason why we'd need them. As long as those dogs stay outside of our borders, we're fine.\"\nBryling: \"\"The Stormcloaks are far from the only threat to the hold. The roads are beset by bandits and beasts... and now there's even talk of bloody &lt;a href=\"Dragons%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;dragons&lt;/a&gt;.\"\"\nErikur: \"My dear Bryling. Barring any... fancy and folly... the good people of Haafingar are surely capable of dealing with the odd highwayman or stray dog.\"\nBryling: \"Trouble on the roads and cities means less commerce. Less commerce means less money and more starving people. And that means more crime.\"\nErikur: \"\"Humph. That's only a problem for people who can't afford to hire their own security.\nElisif: \"That may well be our only answer. I will empower my Steward to seek out capable individuals to secure Haafingar. Thank you, my Thanes.\"\nElisif: \"Steward Falk, I have a task for you. I want to begin stockpiling food and water in the event we come under siege, and I would like you to oversee this work personally.\"\nFalk: \"A wise course of action, my Jarl. However, we have little food or water to spare.\"\nErikur: \"General Tullius will never allow that. He's ordered all surplus food to be given over for the war effort.\"\nFalk: \"General Tullius does not run this city, Thane Erikur. Or have you forgotten your oaths of fealty?\"\nErikur: \"My apologies, Jarl Elisif. I was thinking only of the importance of the war effort.\"\nElisif: \"There's no need for an apology, and you're right about the war. Perhaps this is a matter best discussed with the general in person.\"\nFalk: \"I will make the arrangements, my Jarl.\"\nElisif: \"Steward, when is my appointment to meet with General Tullius? There are some issues we must speak about.\"\nFalk: \"I'm afraid he's had to reschedule, my grace. By all accounts, waging war takes his every moment.\"\nElisif: \"Again? He can't simply cancel an appointment with the Jarl! He serves in my capital city!\"\nFalk: \"I'm afraid he can. His authority comes from the emperor, whom you also serve, technically.\"\nElisif: \"He uses all of Haafingar's resources, and doesn't answer to me in the slightest? This hardly seems fair.\"\nFalk: \"\"\"Fair\" is a word rarely applied to politics, my grace. I'm afraid you must learn to accept this.\"\"\n&lt;a href=\"Varnius%20Junius\"&gt;Varnius&lt;/a&gt;: \"\"I swear to you, unnatural magics are coming from &lt;a href=\"Wolfskull%20Cave\"&gt;that cave&lt;/a&gt;! There are strange noises and lights! We need someone to investigate!\"\"\nElisif: \"Then we will immediately send out a legion to scour the cave and secure the town. Haafingar's people will always be safe under my rule.\"\nVarnius: \"Th... thank you, my Jarl. Thank you.\"\nSybille: \"\"Your eminence, my scrying has suggested nothing in the area. &lt;a href=\"Dragon%20Bridge%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Dragon Bridge&lt;/a&gt; is under imperial control. This is likely superstitious nonsense.\"\"\nFalk: \"Perhaps a more... tempered reaction... might be called for?\"\nElisif: \"\"Oh. Yes, of course you are right. Falk, tell &lt;a href=\"Captain%20Aldis\"&gt;Captain Aldis&lt;/a&gt; I said to assign a few extra soldiers to Dragon Bridge.\"\"\nVarnius: \"Thank you, Jarl Elisif. But about the cave...\"\nFalk: \"I will have someone take care of the cave as well, Varnius, you can rest easy. You're dismissed.\""}

It is home to the &lt;a href=\"Khajiit\"&gt;Khajiit&lt;/a&gt;, a playable bestial\u00a0and feline race in all of the main games of The Elder Scrolls so far. As of the events of (&lt;a href=\"4E%20201\"&gt;4E 201&lt;/a&gt;) the province is separated into two nations, both of which are client states of the &lt;a href=\"Aldmeri%20Dominion%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Aldmeri Dominion&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href=\"Anequina\"&gt;Anequina&lt;/a&gt; to the North incorporates a desert like badlands fairly similar to that of &lt;a href=\"Hammerfell\"&gt;Hammerfell&lt;/a&gt;, whilst to the South lies &lt;a href=\"Pelletine\"&gt;Pelletine&lt;/a&gt;, its geography consisting of a variety of dense jungles and woodland comparable to that of &lt;a href=\"Valenwood\"&gt;Valenwood&lt;/a&gt;. The province is bordered by Valenwood to the west, &lt;a href=\"Cyrodiil\"&gt;Cyrodiil&lt;/a&gt; to the north and east and &lt;a href=\"Black%20Marsh\"&gt;Black Marsh&lt;/a&gt; to the east, across the &lt;a href=\"Topal%20Sea\"&gt;Topal Sea&lt;/a&gt;.\nPeople.\nThe Khajiit.\nThe Khajiit are the native race of Elsweyr. Both a Khajiit's appearance and physiology depend on the Lunar Lattice of &lt;a href=\"Masser\"&gt;Masser&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Secunda\"&gt;Secunda&lt;/a&gt; during the time of its birth. These appearances can vary drastically from one breed to another, with some Khajiit resembling the common house cat, other Khajiit resembling huge bipedal jaguars, and others being almost indistinguishable from &lt;a href=\"Men\"&gt;Men&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"Mer\"&gt;Mer&lt;/a&gt;.\nMany Khajiit disdain weapons in favor of their natural claws. They make excellent thieves due to their natural agility and unmatched acrobatic abilities. Many Khajiit are also warriors, although this is mainly true of the &lt;a href=\"Cathay\"&gt;Cathay&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Cathay-raht\"&gt;Cathay-raht&lt;/a&gt;, while the other breeds are quadrupedal - either muscular and extremely hardy or lithe and very agile. In addition to their native quickness, Khajiit have developed a natural proficiency in stealth, and have the added benefit of native night vision.\nGovernment.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Khajiit\"&gt;Khajiit&lt;/a&gt; are ruled by the &lt;a href=\"Mane\"&gt;Mane&lt;/a&gt;, a spiritual leader of the Khajiit, who, in ancient times, remained neutral in conflicts. The Mane is different from other Khajiit, although he is not of a different breed. The Mane is born during the alignment of &lt;a href=\"Masser\"&gt;Masser&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Secunda\"&gt;Secunda&lt;/a&gt; (the two moons), and when another rarely seen moon is visible. It is said that there can only be one Mane at any given time, although whether this is magical, or the result of the Mane eliminating competition is unknown. Alternatively, it could be due to the very specific lunar conditions that are present at his birth. The manifestation of such a scenario may only occur once in a lifetime; however, there is no lore regarding its frequency.\nHistory.\nAccording to Khajiiti version of \"&lt;a href=\"the%20Monomyth\"&gt;the Monomyth&lt;/a&gt;\", Khajiit were first envisioned by the ancestral mother, the first cat &lt;a href=\"Fadomai\"&gt;Fadomai&lt;/a&gt;. Fadomai selected her favored daughter &lt;a href=\"Azurah\"&gt;Azurah&lt;/a&gt; to take one of the already existing races, and refashion them, that they might be the \"fastest, cleverest, most beautiful people,\" and that they should be called Khajiit. Azurah came down to &lt;a href=\"Nirn\"&gt;Nirn&lt;/a&gt;, took a forest people torn between man and beast, called them Khajiit, and placed them in the best deserts and forests on Nirn. There she made them of many shapes, and taught them the value of secrets. This account would seem to imply that the Khajiit arose from another race through divine intervention. This race has been linked in other sources to the ancestral Altmeri stock. However, some early Aldmeri accounts record the ancient Khajiit existing in Tamriel since the early &lt;a href=\"Merethic%20Era\"&gt;Merethic Era&lt;/a&gt;.\nNothing much is known of the Khajiit in between their settlement of the deserts and forests of Elsweyr and their foundation of a common confederacy. Prior to &lt;a href=\"2E%20309\"&gt;2E 309&lt;/a&gt;, Elsweyr was almost continuously mired in internal conflict and strife between its tribal factions. Due to its tribal strife, it was incapable of presenting a common force to external enemies, and, in the words of the Pocket Guide to The Empire, \"the nearly constant insurrection and tribal warfare among the catmen rarely troubled the stage of history.\" What is known is that Khajiit have some knowledge of the events at &lt;a href=\"Red%20Mountain\"&gt;Red Mountain&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"War%20of%20the%20First%20Council\"&gt;War of the First Council&lt;/a&gt;, as they have their own name for the eruption at &lt;a href=\"Vvardenfell\"&gt;Vvardenfell&lt;/a&gt; Mountain, \"Sun's Death.\" Some sources even state that the Khajiit fought alongside &lt;a href=\"Wulfharth\"&gt;Wulfharth&lt;/a&gt; at the Battle of Red Mountain.\nSecond Era.\nElsweyr established central government in &lt;a href=\"2E%20309\"&gt;2E 309&lt;/a&gt;, under the guidance of Keirgo of &lt;a href=\"Anequina\"&gt;Anequina&lt;/a&gt; and Eshita of &lt;a href=\"Pellitine\"&gt;Pellitine&lt;/a&gt;. The agreement between the two Khajiit leaders, combined their holdings into one kingdom. The name \"Elsweyr\" arose from an old Khajiiti proverb that went along the lines of \"perfect society is always elsewhere.\" The resultant state caused a great deal of discord amongst the members of the former feudal aristocracy, who, feeling betrayed, chose to rise up in arms against the united state. Keirgo fruitlessly petitioned the &lt;a href=\"Cyrodiil\"&gt;Empire of Cyrodiil&lt;/a&gt; for aid and was met with failure, for the Cyrodiilic Empire was experiencing its own internal issues. The former capital of Anequia, Ne Quin-al, fell to the rebels. A ceasefire was achieved when the normally nonpartisan spiritual leader Mane Rid-T'har-ri'Datta stepped in to broker talks. A lasting peace ensued, as the tribes and the urbanized elite established terms whereby control of Elsweyr shifted according to the phases of the moons Masser and Secunda. The two parties to the deal experience only nominal control of Elsweyr, and that true power lies in the Mane, whose government is \"secretive.\"\nPotentate Versidue-Shaie, a &lt;a href=\"Tsaesci\"&gt;Tsaesci&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"Akavir\"&gt;Akavir&lt;/a&gt;, who began the Second Era of Tamrielic history by assassinating the last of the Reman dynasty of Emperors and took up the throne of Cyrodiil, established his palace in the Elsweyr kingdom of Senechal. He was murdered there in &lt;a href=\"2E%20324\"&gt;2E 324&lt;/a&gt; by assassins, members of the &lt;a href=\"Morag%20Tong\"&gt;Morag Tong&lt;/a&gt;, a religious order from &lt;a href=\"Morrowind\"&gt;Morrowind&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Knahaten%20Flu\"&gt;Knahaten Flu&lt;/a&gt; spread to &lt;a href=\"Senchal\"&gt;Senchal&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"2E%20560\"&gt;2E 560&lt;/a&gt;, and quickly plagued most of Elsweyr. The Khajiit joined the &lt;a href=\"First%20Aldmeri%20Dominion\"&gt;First Aldmeri Dominion&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"2E%20580\"&gt;2E 580&lt;/a&gt; with the signing of the &lt;a href=\"Elden%20Accord\"&gt;Elden Accord&lt;/a&gt;, overseen by Mane &lt;a href=\"Akkhuz-ri\"&gt;Akkhuz-ri&lt;/a&gt;. In &lt;a href=\"2E%20582\"&gt;2E 582&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"Maormer\"&gt;Maormer&lt;/a&gt; attempted to tighten their grip on &lt;a href=\"Khenarthi%27s%20Roost\"&gt;Khenarthi's Roost&lt;/a&gt; and assassinated &lt;a href=\"the%20Silvenar\"&gt;the Silvenar&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Edhelorn\"&gt;Edhelorn&lt;/a&gt;, but were defeated by the Dominion. &lt;a href=\"Javad%20Tharn\"&gt;Javad Tharn&lt;/a&gt; corrupted the Mane Akkhuz-ri with the &lt;a href=\"Dark%20Mane\"&gt;Dark Mane&lt;/a&gt;, forcing him to step down. After &lt;a href=\"Shazah\"&gt;Shazah&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"Khali\"&gt;Khali&lt;/a&gt; completed the Lunar Trials and became the next Mane, they defeated Javad Tharn and brought peace to Reaper's March.\nJavad Tharn's mother and Abnur Tharn's half-sister, Euraxia, took over the city of Rimmen in 2E 576 in an event known as the Frostfall Coup with the support of her own miitia known as the Euraxians, her reign is known to be strict and full of strife. \nBetween &lt;a href=\"2E%20861\"&gt;2E 861&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"2E%20864\"&gt;864&lt;/a&gt;, the city of &lt;a href=\"Senchal\"&gt;Senchal&lt;/a&gt; refused to surrender to &lt;a href=\"General%20Pottreid\"&gt;General Pottreid&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Third%20Legion\"&gt;Third Legion&lt;/a&gt; of the &lt;a href=\"Septim%20Empire\"&gt;Septim Empire&lt;/a&gt;. As a result, they invaded the city and killed dozens of men, women, and children.\nThird Era.\nA seized portion of Elsweyr, an area near &lt;a href=\"Rimmen\"&gt;Rimmen&lt;/a&gt;, was the chosen assemblage site of the &lt;a href=\"Dwemer\"&gt;Dwemer&lt;/a&gt; artifact known as the &lt;a href=\"Numidium\"&gt;Numidium&lt;/a&gt;. The land was taken by a contingent of the Emperor's elite guard, the &lt;a href=\"Blades\"&gt;Blades&lt;/a&gt;, and forcibly cleared of its native Khajiit population. Upon that land &lt;a href=\"the%20Halls%20of%20Colossus\"&gt;the Halls of Colossus&lt;/a&gt; were built. Imperial Engineers under the &lt;a href=\"Imperial%20Battlemage\"&gt;Battlemage&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Zurin%20Arctus\"&gt;Zurin Arctus&lt;/a&gt; then assembled the machine. Native Khajiiti inhabitants record that a &lt;a href=\"Dragon%20Break\"&gt;Dragon Break&lt;/a&gt; occurred during the assemblage process, which led to continuing health issues for generations onward. After the Numidium was destroyed, The Empire seemingly had obfuscated the story surrounding the Numidium, creating an alternate history for the halls, wherein they were built by giants. Despite this, some inhabitants of Elsweyr know the truth of the Halls of Colossus, as the area is still uninhabitable due to Numidium's construction poisoning the area. Many Khajiit still loathe the Empire for their actions at Rimmen.\nFollowing the tumultuous history of the Numidium, which only touches on Elsweyr briefly, surviving literature records no event in Elsweyr until 3E 394, when the Five Year War began. The war began following an event the Khajiit call the \"Slaughter of Torval.\" The Khajiit claim that over a thousand Khajiti citizens were killed by an invading &lt;a href=\"Bosmer\"&gt;Bosmer&lt;/a&gt;i force from &lt;a href=\"Valenwood\"&gt;Valenwood&lt;/a&gt; without provocation, while the Bosmer claim that the attack was in retaliation for the disruption in trade resultant from Khajiti raids on Valenwood's wood caravans. The war ended in &lt;a href=\"3E%20399\"&gt;3E 399&lt;/a&gt;, with a Khajiti victory, following tactical and strategic moves by Khajiit tribesmen that were seen as impressive both by foreign commentators and the tribesmen themselves.\nFourth Era.\nIn the wake of the &lt;a href=\"Oblivion%20Crisis\"&gt;Oblivion Crisis&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"3E%20433\"&gt;3E 433&lt;/a&gt;, which ended the Third Era, the city of Rimmen declared its independence from the Elsweyr confederacy, becoming a sovereign state of its own once again. The Mane of Elsweyr was assassinated in the early Fourth Era, sometime prior to &lt;a href=\"4E%2049\"&gt;4E 49&lt;/a&gt;. Elsweyr was also independent of the Empire during this time. When it rejoined the Empire is unknown. The effects of the Great War of the Fourth Era on Elsweyr are unrecorded, though it is known that the Elsweyr confederacy joined the &lt;a href=\"Aldmeri%20Dominion%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Aldmeri Dominion&lt;/a&gt; as a vassal state after they claimed the credit for stopping an event known as the &lt;a href=\"Void%20Nights\"&gt;Void Nights&lt;/a&gt;, when the moons &lt;a href=\"Masser\"&gt;Masser&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Secunda\"&gt;Secunda&lt;/a&gt; disappeared between &lt;a href=\"4E%2098\"&gt;4E 98&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"4E%20100\"&gt;4E 100&lt;/a&gt;. Following a coup in &lt;a href=\"4E%20115\"&gt;4E 115&lt;/a&gt;, the Elsweyr Confederacy was dissolved into the ancient client states of &lt;a href=\"Anequina\"&gt;Anequina&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Pelletine\"&gt;Pelletine&lt;/a&gt;.\nReligion.\nThe Khajiit religion, while quite different from that of the men or mer, is still clearly derived from the old &lt;a href=\"Aldmer\"&gt;Aldmer&lt;/a&gt;i pantheon. The Khajiit creation myth includes references to powerful ancestor cats with strikingly familiar names. Their legends start with the original litter mates, Ahnurr and Fadomai (Anu and Padomay). These two gave birth to all of the great spiritual children, including Alkosh the first cat (&lt;a href=\"Akatosh\"&gt;Akatosh&lt;/a&gt;), Khenarthi (&lt;a href=\"Kynareth\"&gt;Kynareth&lt;/a&gt;), Magrus (&lt;a href=\"Magnus\"&gt;Magnus&lt;/a&gt;), &lt;a href=\"Mara\"&gt;Mara&lt;/a&gt;, and S'rendarr (&lt;a href=\"Stendarr\"&gt;Stendarr&lt;/a&gt;). A second litter of children soon followed, including Merrunz (&lt;a href=\"Mehrunes%20Dagon\"&gt;Mehrunes Dagon&lt;/a&gt;), Mafala (&lt;a href=\"Mephala\"&gt;Mephala&lt;/a&gt;), and Sangiin (&lt;a href=\"Sanguine\"&gt;Sanguine&lt;/a&gt;), among others. Ahnurr did not want further children, but Fadomai was persuaded by her elder children to birth one more litter, this final group containing &lt;a href=\"Azura\"&gt;Azura&lt;/a&gt;h, Nirni, and the moons. At this, Ahnurr became angry at Fadomai, who fled to the void, and birthed one last child, &lt;a href=\"Lorkhan\"&gt;Lorkhaj&lt;/a&gt;. Fadomai knew she was dying, her life having been drained by her birth, but she gave to Nirni a gift, that she would birth children of her own.\nNirni went to Lorkhaj, asking him to form a dwelling place for her children. This he did, but he tricked his siblings, forming the mortal plane and trapping many of them there with him. Most of Fadomai's first litter were trapped, while her second litter saw the danger and fled. Into this dwelling, Nirni birthed many children, the various human and mer races of Tamriel. However, one of Fadomai's children, Azurah, had also been given a gift by their mother. She was given permission to take one of Nirni's children, and reshape them to her own liking, so long as she made them the fastest, cleverest, and most beautiful of all creatures. Azurah chose a group of forest dwellers among Nirni's children, and from them, she formed the Khajiit. Nirni was furious at this, and asked her sibling Y'ffer to punish the Khajiit. He did this by turning their grasslands into a dry desert, and their forests into poisonous marshes. The Khajiit, however, were protected by Azurah, who taught them the secret of the moons (the Lunar Lattice in Khajiiti terms), and how to change their shapes to survive. Those forest dwellers who stayed true to their mother, Nirni, were turned into the &lt;a href=\"Bosmer\"&gt;Bosmer&lt;/a&gt;, and given the lush forests of Valenwood as their home.\nThe Khajiit pantheon is similar to that of the Ayleids, who worshipped both Aedra and Daedra.\nGeography.\nElsweyr's location has been fixed since the first entry in the series, , where it was found in the southern half of the continent, bordering &lt;a href=\"Cyrodiil\"&gt;Cyrodiil&lt;/a&gt; to the north and northeast, &lt;a href=\"Valenwood\"&gt;Valenwood&lt;/a&gt; to the west, and the Topal Sea to the southeast. Elsweyr is primarily a province of \"harsh badlands and dry plains,\" with fertile growing regions covered in jungle and rainforest to the south. Elsweyr's society is divided along these lines, with a stratified plantation &lt;a href=\"aristocracy\"&gt;aristocracy&lt;/a&gt; centered on production of the hallucinogenic &lt;a href=\"Moon%20Sugar\"&gt;Moon Sugar&lt;/a&gt; occupying the southern groves, and a society of nomadic desert tribesmen occupying the badlands and desert. Elsweyr was explorable in \"Arena\", but has not been accessible since until . Small elements of Khajiit culture recur in each game. &lt;a href=\"Skooma\"&gt;Skooma&lt;/a&gt;, a drug processed from Moon Sugar, figures in various plotlines and accompanying lore.\nNative life.\nFlora.\nThe herb and alchemical ingredient Nightshade is native to Elsweyr, and is reputed to be quite poisonous. Despite that, the Khajiit cherish the Nightshade, attributing magical powers to it and hiding it in \"their armor to increase their abilities to skulk, hide and become invisible.\" The plant is also to be found in Western Cyrodiil, surrounding Skingrad, but also in lesser quantities around &lt;a href=\"Bravil\"&gt;Bravil&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;a href=\"Nibenay%20Basin\"&gt;Nibenay Basin&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Cheydinhal\"&gt;Cheydinhal&lt;/a&gt; in the northeast. In , Nightshade, properly processed, damages health and luck, burdens, and fortifies magicka. As no further effects are registered, it could be presumed that the Khajiit habit remains a bit of superstition.\nMoon sugar grows here, which the Khajiit process in order to create skooma, which is a popular drug amongst the Khajiit. Skooma is addictive and illegal in most provinces. It is smuggled at sea by pirates to all shores and can be found in skooma dens.\nFauna.\nThe Treatise on Lycanthropy records that cursed Khajiits called &lt;a href=\"Werelion\"&gt;Werelion&lt;/a&gt;s, a \"vile presence,\" inhabit Elsweyr, as well Black Marsh and southern Cyrodiil.\nLarge felines known collectively as &lt;a href=\"Senche-Cats\"&gt;Senche-Cats&lt;/a&gt; are native to Elsweyr. They are distant relatives of the Khajiit, sharing their namesake with the Senche breeds of Khajiit. Unlike the Khajiit however, Senche-Cats lack the ability to to speak. There are various forms of Senche-Cats such as &lt;a href=\"Senche-Tiger\"&gt;Senche-Tiger&lt;/a&gt;s and &lt;a href=\"Senche-Lioness\"&gt;Senche-Lions&lt;/a&gt;.\nA species of wolf known as the &lt;a href=\"Rimmen%20Ringtailed%20Wolf\"&gt;Rimmen Ringtailed Wolf&lt;/a&gt; is native to Rimmen. &lt;a href=\"Akaviri\"&gt;Akaviri&lt;/a&gt; settlers in Rimmen took a liking to these wolves and decided to domesticate and breed them for use as mounts."}

The Defense Force is officially supported by the &lt;a href=\"Aldmeri%20Dominion%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Aldmeri Dominion&lt;/a&gt;, but the &lt;a href=\"Alliance%20War\"&gt;Alliance War&lt;/a&gt; has prevented them from providing material aid.\nBackground.\nSometime after the Frostfall Coup, the Elsweyr Defense Force was founded and was able to capture the city of &lt;a href=\"Riverhold%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Riverhold&lt;/a&gt; from the Euraxians. They were prepared to attack the regional capital of Rimmen and depose Euraxia before the sudden appearance of dragons across Elsweyr disrupted their plans. The Defense Force used the city of Riverhold as their base of operations well as an &lt;a href=\"Defense%20Force%20Outpost\"&gt;outpost&lt;/a&gt; directly south from it to project throughout the near area. The outpost was later destroyed in a coordinated attack by Euraxian necromancers and dragons. Following the destruction of the outpost, Riverhold also came under direct attack, but the dragons and Euraxians were successfully repelled following the death of the dragon.\nWith the help of the &lt;a href=\"Vestige\"&gt;Vestige&lt;/a&gt;, the Defense Force attacked Rimmen, first disabling the siege weapons aimed at the city's own population from inside before entering. The battle resulted in the death of Euraxia and the ascension of &lt;a href=\"Khamira%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Khamira&lt;/a&gt; to the throne. With the city taken, the Defense Force established a permanent presence in Rimmen. Assisting the Defense Force throughout the conflict were the &lt;a href=\"Cygnus%20Irregulars\"&gt;Cygnus Irregulars&lt;/a&gt;, a former &lt;a href=\"Imperial%20Legion%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Imperial Legion&lt;/a&gt; that had subtly worked to disrupt Euraxia while ostensibly being aligned with her. Under the command of &lt;a href=\"Prefect%20Calo\"&gt;Prefect Calo&lt;/a&gt;, the Cygnus Irregulars were pardoned by Gharesh-ri and formed an alliance with the Defense Force.\nPost-Euraxia.\nDespite Euraxia having died and the control of Rimmen passing to the Defense Force, the Euraxians and, more significantly, the dragons, continued to pose a threat to the region's safety and stability. Now under the command of Euraxia's chief necromancer, &lt;a href=\"Zumog%20Phoom%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Zumog Phoom&lt;/a&gt;, the Euraxians continued their alliance with the dragons, forwarding &lt;a href=\"Kaalgrontiid%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Kaalgrontiid&lt;/a&gt; plan to absorb the power from &lt;a href=\"Jode%27s%20Core%20%28Location%29\"&gt;Jode's Core&lt;/a&gt;. The Defense Force and the Cygnus Irregulars fortified the ruins among the &lt;a href=\"Moon%20Gate%20of%20Anequina\"&gt;Moon Gate of Anequina&lt;/a&gt; against the remaining Euraxians to slow the dragons ingress into the Core. While the Vestige defeated the dragons in Jode's Core, the remaining Euraxians were routed by the Defense Force and Cygnus Irregulars.\nElsweyr Dragon Defense Force.\nThe Elsweyr Dragon Defense Force is a subunit of the Defense Force focused on combating dragons in Elsweyr. Administratively, the Force only consists of &lt;a href=\"Captain%20Samara\"&gt;Captain Samara&lt;/a&gt; and her second-in-command &lt;a href=\"Apprentice%20Taz\"&gt;Apprentice Taz&lt;/a&gt;, who train prospective dragon slayers in the best methods of combat and survival. Militia members, adventurers and mercenaries are all eligable to recieve training by undergoing the three trials: knowledge, endurance, and bravery. Trainees must recover ancient lore on dragon slaying techniques, recover standards left in dangerous dungeons, and, finally, slay a dragon and return with its heart."}

Ayleid and Dwemer ruins are the most common to find.\nAldmeri ruins were largely constructed in the Merethic Era by elven explorers from the continent of Aldmeris. Most of their settlements were built in the Summerset Isles, utilizing colosseum-like stonework and containing malondo stones. The ones on Auridon were constructed by the Ancients, using an alternate style and containing culanda stones. Most of them fell into ruin due to the decreasing population of the province, or events such as the &lt;a href=\"Hyperagonal%20Collapse%20Incident\"&gt;Hyperagonal Collapse Incident&lt;/a&gt; in Eldbur Ruins causing them to be abandoned. The Aldmer also constructed various towers in Morrowind.\nChimer and Dunmer ruins vary in architectural style. Many of them are Daedric Ruins built as places of worship and later abandoned, and strongholds made by House Dagoth before their dissolution. Ancestral tombs and Velothi towers are also sometimes considered Chimer ruins, though the latter were built by the Aldmer.\nOrcish ruins were largely constructed by various clans in the Wrothgarian Mountains area during the Classical Period. They are often carved into mountains and are almost entirely made out of stone and built with a triangular style, containing large forges and reanimated statues.\nSnow Elf ruins were built in the Merethic Era before the race's decline from the Nordic-Falmer War. Many are often seen in isolated areas and were incredibly hardy, able to stand for millennia with no wear. They had a very elegant architectural style, building their edifices with white stone and gold lining."}

Filled with wild creatures both fantastic and mundane in addition to monstrous &lt;a href=\"Lycanthropy%20%28Online%29\"&gt;lycanthropes&lt;/a&gt;, it is a mystical wilderness as beautiful as it is dangerous.\nFather to all of &lt;a href=\"Tamriel\"&gt;Tamriel&lt;/a&gt;'s lycanthropes, the souls of those who accept Hircine's \u201cblessing\" spend eternity stalking the Hunting Grounds. However, on occasion, the Daedric Prince hosts a Great Hunt, giving mortals a rare opportunity to enter the March of Sacrifices and stalk a powerful creature of his choosing. In this case, it is the Great &lt;a href=\"Indrik\"&gt;Indrik&lt;/a&gt; called &lt;a href=\"Tarcyr\"&gt;Tarcyr&lt;/a&gt;.

These include Hanu's Compassion light set that gives players and anybody they resurrect a powerful buff, helping them both get back into the fight.\nFinally, should players complete March of Sacrifices on Veteran difficulty, they will earn the Balorgh monster mask. When coupled with its shoulders, this set buffs weapon damage each time players trigger their Ultimate ability, opening up enemies for some burst damage.\nThe book \"&lt;a href=\"The%20Huntsman%20Prince\"&gt;The Huntsman Prince&lt;/a&gt;\" may also be found next to &lt;a href=\"Hanu\"&gt;Hanu&lt;/a&gt;, near the beginning of the dungeon.\nThe Great Indrik Hunt.\nBoons:\nCreatures.\nWithin Hircine's realm, players will encounter many beasts roaming the wilderness, as well as other teams competing in the event, and they can be just as dangerous as any of the Hunting Ground's native creatures.\nIn addition to the area's beasts and competitors, five challenging bosses guard the paths of the March of Sacrifices, including wild witches, spriggans, and more. One of the bosses players must face is the target of the hunt: the Great Indrik, Tarcyr.\nOf all the fellow hunters participating in the event, none are more dangerous than &lt;a href=\"Balorgh\"&gt;Balorgh&lt;/a&gt;.

He appears outnumbered, and he's requested I lend him a helping hand.\"\nWalkthrough.\nThis quest starts south of &lt;a href=\"the%20Bulwark\"&gt;the Bulwark&lt;/a&gt; in Raven Rock. Near &lt;a href=\"Old%20Attius%20Farm\"&gt;Old Attius Farm&lt;/a&gt;, a dark elf, Captain Veleth, head of the &lt;a href=\"Redoran%20Guard%20%28Dragonborn%29\"&gt;Redoran Guard&lt;/a&gt;, is found fighting several ash spawn.\nAfter helping him defeat the creatures, he will say that the ash spawn have been attacking more frequently and, peculiarly, seem to be becoming organized. With an offer of help, he will ask the &lt;a href=\"Last%20Dragonborn\"&gt;Dragonborn&lt;/a&gt; to look for clues as to why the ash spawn are attacking Raven Rock. \n\"Thanks... I wasn't sure I'd make it out alive. I wish I could have said the same for my man here.\"\nWhat were those things? \"\"Some of the Redoran Guard have taken to calling them \"ash spawn.\" Me? I don't care what they're called... all I know is they're a danger to Raven Rock and they need to be stopped.\"\"\nHow did that bring you to this old farm? \"I was going to search for clues that might mead me to wherever they're coming from. I know it isn't the best place to start, but we know they've been coming from this direction.\"\nIn one of the ash piles left by the dead ash spawn will be a note called \"&lt;a href=\"Declaration%20of%20War\"&gt;Declaration of War&lt;/a&gt;\". Giving it to Veleth continues the quest. \nI discovered this note on one of the ash spawn. \"This is stange. The note nays it's from General Falx Carius, but that's impossible.\"\nThe note appears to be from &lt;a href=\"General%20Falx%20Carius\"&gt;General Falx Carius&lt;/a&gt;, however this cannot be true, since he died over 200 years ago due to the eruption of &lt;a href=\"Red%20Mountain\"&gt;Red Mountain&lt;/a&gt;. Veleth suspects foul play at work, and asks the Dragonborn to find the general at &lt;a href=\"Fort%20Frostmoth%20%28Dragonborn%29\"&gt;Fort Frostmoth&lt;/a&gt; and kill him. Fort Frostmoth is located directly east of Old Attius Farm. On the map it appears as five white circles (those are the ash-topped towers) on the south coast of &lt;a href=\"Solstheim%20%28Dragonborn%29\"&gt;Solstheim&lt;/a&gt;. The main entrance is from the south, and there are several ash spawn inside.\nWhen the courtyard is entered, an alarm will be raised that there is an intruder in the fort. General Carius will appear on the far building's rooftop, declaring \"Fort Frostmoth will not fall! Long live the Empire!\" before retreating back inside to leave the ash spawn to deal with the threat. This raises some ash spawn from the ground. Carius is located downstairs in a locked room in the western building (on the left as the courtyard is entered).\nUpon entering the building, there are two ash spawn. To the left (south) are several shelves, one of which holds an &lt;a href=\"East%20Empire%20Company%20strongbox\"&gt;East Empire Company strongbox&lt;/a&gt;. Further to the south, a ramp leads up to a ladder to the roof.\nBack at the entrance, directly ahead (west) is an adept-locked chest. To the right (north) are stairs leading down. Directly forward from their bottom is a master-locked gate. To the left (west) is an opening blocked by a spider web that an be cut through. Beyond is a short corridor that leads down to a room with two &lt;a href=\"Heart%20Stone\"&gt;Heart Stone&lt;/a&gt; deposits, three &lt;a href=\"Ruby%20Geode\"&gt;Ruby Geode&lt;/a&gt;s, and a passage to the north that comes to a dead end.\nTo the right (east) of the gate is the corpse of &lt;a href=\"Maximian%20Axius\"&gt;Maximian Axius&lt;/a&gt;, plus his knapsack and several &lt;a href=\"A%20Letter%20to%20Selina%20I\"&gt;letters&lt;/a&gt;. In the east wall is a wooden door that requires a key. Another passage continues north, then comes to a T intersection where an ash spawn lies in wait. To the right (east) are two coffins with little loot. The path left eventually leads to a large room with many coffins. Two coffins are stacked on top of each other with a knapsack in front of them and \"&lt;a href=\"Ildari%27s%20Journal\"&gt;Ildari's Journal&lt;/a&gt;\" resting atop them. In the knapsack is the \"Fort Frostmoth Key,\" which will open the locked door as well as the gate.\nPast the gate is a room with several bottles of &lt;a href=\"Cyrodilic%20Brandy%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Cyrodiilic Brandy&lt;/a&gt;, and a chest. The locked door leads to stairs up to a large room with the general. Open the door with the key and defeat him and his attendant ash spawn. Search his corpse for the &lt;a href=\"Champion%27s%20Cudgel\"&gt;Champion's Cudgel&lt;/a&gt; and possibly a \"&lt;a href=\"Letter%20to%20Imperial%20City\"&gt;Letter to Imperial City&lt;/a&gt;\". Returning to Captain Veleth, with or without a note, will cause him to give a reward. It turns out that a necromancer named &lt;a href=\"Ildari%20Sarothril\"&gt;Ildari&lt;/a&gt; had found a way to animate the General's body from death; this is learned from reading the journal left in the crypt underneath Fort Frostmoth.\nIt's done. \"What news do you bring from Fort Frostmoth?\"\nIf the Dragonborn killed General Carius before speaking with Captain Veleth, they can speak to a &lt;a href=\"Redoran%20Guard\"&gt;Redoran Guard&lt;/a&gt;, saying: \"\"I have some information about Fort Frostmoth.\" to which he will reply: \"You should bring this information to Captain Veleth as soon as possible.\"\" Doing so will allow the Dragonborn to turn in the quest and receive the reward.\nI think I've solved your ash spawn problem. \"Excuse me? How can you be so certain?\""}

After hiring him, and wearing an &lt;a href=\"Amulet%20of%20Mara%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Amulet of Mara&lt;/a&gt;, Marcurio becomes a candidate for &lt;a href=\"marriage%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;marriage&lt;/a&gt;.\nPersonality.\nMarcurio is a &lt;a href=\"Mage%20%28Class%29\"&gt;mage&lt;/a&gt; who is feisty and sassy, saying things such as \"\"Try not to walk into any spike-filled pits or filthy skeever dens.\" \"\nHe is very interested in &lt;a href=\"Dwemer\"&gt;Dwemer&lt;/a&gt; culture and technology, though he admits he would like them more were they not constantly trying to kill him. When in &lt;a href=\"Nordic%20Tombs\"&gt;ancient Nordic tombs&lt;/a&gt;, he reflects on his seemingly extensive knowledge of Nordic culture and history.\nFollower.\nMarcurio specializes in &lt;a href=\"Destruction%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Destruction&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Spells%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;spells&lt;/a&gt;. He also prefers to use his default &lt;a href=\"Robes%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;robes&lt;/a&gt;, refusing to equip any other type of robe given to him, though he equips any &lt;a href=\"Armor%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;armor&lt;/a&gt; given to him. Like many other followers, he has a &lt;a href=\"Hunting%20Bow%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;hunting bow&lt;/a&gt; with 12 &lt;a href=\"Iron%20Arrow%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;iron arrows&lt;/a&gt;, which he will use when out of magicka. He will equip any weapon, as long as it is stronger than his (leveled) dagger. However, he prefers to use spells over weapons, which he will use only rarely.\nSpells.\n&lt;a href=\"Restoration%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Restoration&lt;/a&gt;.\nHis favored spells are shock-based, and will use fire as a back-up, though he often has a shock spell in one hand and firebolt in the other. When fighting undead (such as &lt;a href=\"Draugr%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;draugr&lt;/a&gt;), he utilizes the Turn Undead spell. In addition, Marcurio can use any &lt;a href=\"Staves%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;staves&lt;/a&gt; placed in his inventory.\nInteractions.\nInheritance.\nMarcurio leaves a sum of money to the Dragonborn if he dies while in their service. The amount is 300 by default, but increases the longer he is a follower.\nSpouse.\n As with every spouse, Marcurio opens a &lt;a href=\"Merchants%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;shop&lt;/a&gt;, in which items can be bought and sold. Daily, he can give his spouse a share of the profits, in the amount of 100 . This amount stacks if uncollected. He can also be asked to make a &lt;a href=\"Homecooked%20Meal\"&gt;meal&lt;/a&gt;. \nIf is installed, he may be hired as a &lt;a href=\"Steward%20%28Hearthfire%29\"&gt;steward&lt;/a&gt;, and if the Dragonborn has &lt;a href=\"Adoption\"&gt;children&lt;/a&gt;, he is one of the few male spouses who have a dialog option in which the Dragonborn may ask how the children are.

The pirates around it will attack if an attempt to board is made, \"&lt;a href=\"stealing\"&gt;stealing&lt;/a&gt;\" or simply looking within the containers near the ship, or if they catch anyone on the floor or in the 'Captain's Chest' if the three aggressive pirates are dead. Either pick the lock or kill the captain in the quest \"&lt;a href=\"A%20Watery%20Grave\"&gt;A Watery Grave&lt;/a&gt;\" and take the captain's key.\nTheft.\nThe crates on the dock next to the pirate ship, and next to the gangplank, have a special status \u2014 as do the pirates. Because they are pirates, taking their goods, or even (in most cases) attacking them, is not considered a crime in the Imperial City.\nFor this reason, the 'theft' icon will not appear when one points at the crates; be warned, however, that the pirates will consider it stealing! Unlike the vast majority of item thefts in the game, one can sell any items looted from the pirates' crates to merchants. However, be aware that the count of \"Items Stolen\" in the &lt;a href=\"Journal\"&gt;Journal&lt;/a&gt; may go up.\nTrespassing.\nIf the &lt;a href=\"Hero%20of%20Kvatch\"&gt;Hero&lt;/a&gt; approaches the ship (but does not board it), &lt;a href=\"First%20Mate%20Malvulis\"&gt;First Mate Malvulis&lt;/a&gt; will engage the player in a conversation, warning to not enter the ship. True to her word, even touching the planks to board it will make the three pirates hostile. Despite her threat, characters can be seen walking on the ship with no consequences.\nIn the quest \"A Watery\u00a0Grave,\" the Hero must trespass to kill the captain. Killing (or provoking) the pirates\u00a0or hiding in an open crate are methods to board the ship. If the option to hide in the crate was chosen, the Hero must start from the very bottom of the ship and avoid the occupants to reach the captain.\nBattles.\nIf attacked by the pirates, one can legally defend oneself, and any nearby city watch guards that see the assault come to the Hero's aid. So, wait until a guard is nearby before approaching the ship.\u00a0After killing the Captain in his cabin, there will be two pirates coming into the cabin afterwards.\nThe pirates may do nothing and only utter snide comments if items are taken from the crates."}

Markarth has held vast significance in the Reach, being claimed from the &lt;a href=\"Reachmen\"&gt;Reachmen&lt;/a&gt; to the &lt;a href=\"Nords\"&gt;Nords&lt;/a&gt;. Markarth was built from the ruins of &lt;a href=\"Nchuand-Zel\"&gt;Nchuand-Zel&lt;/a&gt;, which has been re-purposed into the modern city-state.\nDescription.\nGeography.\nThe city-state of Markarth is situated deep within the Reach, along the &lt;a href=\"Druadach%20Mountains\"&gt;Druadach Mountains&lt;/a&gt; that make up the border between Skyrim and &lt;a href=\"High%20Rock\"&gt;High Rock&lt;/a&gt;. Markarth, or the original settlement, Nchuand-Zel was built around a large rock formation with twin rivers flowing between the lower valley and the upper path. Walking beyond the gates of Markarth will take the traveler to the base of &lt;a href=\"Karthspire\"&gt;Karthspire&lt;/a&gt;, a large mountain in the center of the &lt;a href=\"Karth%20Valley\"&gt;Karth Valley&lt;/a&gt;. Beyond this point is unsafe territory, filled to the brim with the local &lt;a href=\"Reachmen\"&gt;Reachmen&lt;/a&gt;, both civil and hostile. Reaching the &lt;a href=\"Karth%20River\"&gt;Karth River&lt;/a&gt; from Markarth will reveal a fork in the road, leading to the township of &lt;a href=\"Karthwasten\"&gt;Karthwasten&lt;/a&gt; in the north and the stronghold of &lt;a href=\"Sungard\"&gt;Fort Sungard&lt;/a&gt; in the south. The land that Markarth inhabits has large deposits of &lt;a href=\"silver\"&gt;silver&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"iron\"&gt;iron&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"granite\"&gt;granite&lt;/a&gt;, with the latter being used in the construction of the palace in &lt;a href=\"Evermore\"&gt;Evermore&lt;/a&gt;. The seat of power in Markarth is the &lt;a href=\"Understone%20Keep\"&gt;Understone Keep&lt;/a&gt;, which contains an entrance to Nchuand-Zel, which is still underneath the city-state.\nMarkarth City is divided into two distinct districts, each separated by the large crag in the middle of the city. To the north is Dryside, which contains the market square, as well as, residential homes, which were initially part of the &lt;a href=\"Dwarven%20Ruin\"&gt;Dwarven Ruin&lt;/a&gt;, before being re-purposed by the locals. Dryside in itself is divided, with both an upper and lower level. The lower level is more or less a path to Understone Keep and the &lt;a href=\"Temple%20of%20Dibella\"&gt;Temple of Dibella&lt;/a&gt;, while the upper level contains more homes and even the local treasury. To the south is the Riverside, which is a vast basin, essentially the industrial district of Markarth. Streets descend downwards towards the smelter and the infamous &lt;a href=\"Cidhna%20Mine\"&gt;Cidhna Mine&lt;/a&gt;, which serves as the local prison. The poor and working class of Markarth live here, in an underground slum known as &lt;a href=\"the%20Warrens\"&gt;the Warrens&lt;/a&gt;. Ascending upwards to Understone Keep are several businesses, as well as, an entrance to both the &lt;a href=\"Hall%20of%20the%20Dead%20%28Markarth%29\"&gt;Hall of the Dead&lt;/a&gt; and a sub-section of the Markarth Ruins. Waterfalls flowing above Understone Keep, flowing into each district of the city and eventually the Karth River around the mountain.\nHistory.\n&lt;a href=\"First%20Era\"&gt;First Era&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe Kragen Clan &amp; the city of Nchuand-Zel.\nWith the formation of the &lt;a href=\"First%20Council\"&gt;First Council&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"1E%20420\"&gt;1E 420&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"Dwarves\"&gt;Dwarves&lt;/a&gt; of the &lt;a href=\"Rourken%20Clan\"&gt;Rourken Clan&lt;/a&gt; had self-exiled themselves, eventually settling in the modern-day province of &lt;a href=\"Hammerfell\"&gt;Hammerfell&lt;/a&gt;. But the Rourken were not the only ones to leave &lt;a href=\"Resdayn\"&gt;Resdayn&lt;/a&gt;, the Dwarves of the &lt;a href=\"Kragen%20Clan\"&gt;Kragen Clan&lt;/a&gt; had followed in their footsteps, embarking into the frozen wastes of Skyrim, where they established their first holding, the city-state of &lt;a href=\"Arkngthamz\"&gt;Arkngthamz&lt;/a&gt;. From then on, the Kragen spread across Skyrim, building cities including Nchuand-Zel, the modern-day Markarth. House Kragen had reached a breakthrough when discovering &lt;a href=\"Aetherium\"&gt;Aetherium&lt;/a&gt;, establishing a four-way kingdom in Skyrim. But like the other Dwemer, the Kragen had disappeared, never to be seen again. Nchuand-Zel was abandoned like the other Dwarven settlements in Tamriel. The Dwarven &lt;a href=\"animunculi\"&gt;animunculi&lt;/a&gt; in Nchuand-Zel had laid dormant, waiting to be activated. The ruins were eventually inhabited by the cavernous critters and the outer ruins were taken over by the locals, creating the earliest form of Markarth.\nEmpress Hestra &amp; the first Imperial Invasion.\nIn &lt;a href=\"1E%201033\"&gt;1E 1033&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Empress%20Hestra\"&gt;Empress Hestra&lt;/a&gt; of the &lt;a href=\"Alessian%20Empire\"&gt;Alessian Empire&lt;/a&gt; ordered her legions to conquer the Reach and add it to one of her many dominions. Markarth was her first target and the legions used their force to overthrow the Ard of Markarth due to the disorganized armies of Reachfolk defending the city-ruins. Despite their success in invading Markarth, the Imperial legions were often stuck within the city due to the masses of &lt;a href=\"Red%20Eagle\"&gt;Red Eagle's&lt;/a&gt; rebels waiting outside its walls. Red Eagle's attempts of taking back Markarth were short-lived as he was never able to retake Markarth. When Red Eagle's rebellion ended, Markarth had begun to grow from an occupied ruin into a city with the help of its Imperial settlers. Markarth remained under Imperial rule until the dissolution of the Alessian Empire in &lt;a href=\"1E%202331\"&gt;1E 2331&lt;/a&gt;.\nKastav the Hasty; the Reman's Endeavors in Skyrim.\nIn &lt;a href=\"1E%202801\"&gt;1E 2801&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Emperor%20Kastav\"&gt;Emperor Kastav&lt;/a&gt; of the &lt;a href=\"Reman%20Empire\"&gt;Reman Empire&lt;/a&gt; had seized hostages from the city-state of Markarth, and the settlement of &lt;a href=\"H%27roldan\"&gt;H'roldan&lt;/a&gt;, to ensure the &lt;a href=\"Jarl\"&gt;Jarl&lt;/a&gt;s of the area would bend to his whim and meet the conscripted quotas he had issued. Kastav was known for being an incompetent leader, and his exploits in Skyrim are a prime example of this, especially with his abuse of the &lt;a href=\"Dragonguard\"&gt;Dragonguard&lt;/a&gt; and the events that transpired in &lt;a href=\"Winterhold%20%28City%29\"&gt;Winterhold&lt;/a&gt;. The Dragonguard themselves were used by Kastav to seize the hostages from Markarth and H'roldan. When Kastav was deposed from the throne and succeeded by &lt;a href=\"Reman%20Cyrodiil%20II\"&gt;Reman Cyrodiil II&lt;/a&gt;, the problems that Kastav had already set forth was resolved by Reman II.\n&lt;a href=\"Second%20Era\"&gt;Second Era&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe Despot of Markarth &amp; the King of Worms.\nDuring the &lt;a href=\"Interregnum\"&gt;Interregnum&lt;/a&gt;, the city-state of Markarth was captured by the local &lt;a href=\"Reachmen\"&gt;Reachmen&lt;/a&gt;, led by &lt;a href=\"Caddach\"&gt;Caddach&lt;/a&gt; otherwise known as the &lt;a href=\"Despot%20of%20Markarth\"&gt;Despot of Markarth&lt;/a&gt;. Markarth became the seat of power for an independent kingdom of Skyrim, amidst the Schism between &lt;a href=\"West%20Skyrim\"&gt;West Skyrim&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Old%20Holds\"&gt;Old Holds&lt;/a&gt;. The Despot had issued a dictatorship all across the Reach, even communing with the &lt;a href=\"Daedra\"&gt;Daedra&lt;/a&gt; and even powerful figures such as &lt;a href=\"Mannimarco\"&gt;Mannimarco&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"House%20Tharn\"&gt;House Tharn&lt;/a&gt;. The Despot and the people of Markarth worshipped &lt;a href=\"Hircine\"&gt;Hircine&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"Daedric%20Prince\"&gt;Daedric Prince&lt;/a&gt; of the Hunt. Circa &lt;a href=\"2E%20581\"&gt;2E 581&lt;/a&gt;, an &lt;a href=\"Imperial\"&gt;Imperial&lt;/a&gt; Envoy-Escort named &lt;a href=\"Flaccus%20Terentius\"&gt;Flaccus Terentius&lt;/a&gt; was commissioned by &lt;a href=\"Abnur%20Tharn\"&gt;Abnur Tharn&lt;/a&gt; to document the provinces of Tamriel, and he stumbled onto Markarth, where he was imprisoned in Nchuand-Zel. Before he was sacrificed by Mannimarco, &lt;a href=\"Vanus%20Galerion\"&gt;Vanus Galerion&lt;/a&gt; had appeared before them, battling the King of Worms and escaping with Terentius to Eastern Skyrim. Markarth continued to be ruled by the Despot for an unknown time. The Despot, along with the King of Worms and House Tharn played a large part in the &lt;a href=\"Planemeld\"&gt;Planemeld&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"2E%20582\"&gt;2E 582&lt;/a&gt;.\n&lt;a href=\"Third%20Era\"&gt;Third Era&lt;/a&gt;.\nMarkarth Side during the Imperial Simulacrum.\nDuring the &lt;a href=\"Imperial%20Simulacrum\"&gt;Imperial Simulacrum&lt;/a&gt; from &lt;a href=\"3E%20389\"&gt;3E 389&lt;/a&gt; to &lt;a href=\"3E%20399\"&gt;3E 399&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Emperor\"&gt;Emperor&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Uriel%20Septim%20VII\"&gt;Uriel Septim VII&lt;/a&gt; was imprisoned along with &lt;a href=\"Talin%20Warhaft\"&gt;Talin Warhaft&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;a href=\"Deadlands\"&gt;Deadlands&lt;/a&gt; by &lt;a href=\"Jagar%20Tharn\"&gt;Jagar Tharn&lt;/a&gt;. Tharn planned for months to capture the throne, and he was able to achieve so in the span of ten years. Tharn had a powerful weapon called the &lt;a href=\"Staff%20of%20Chaos\"&gt;Staff of Chaos&lt;/a&gt;, and he split it into nine pieces and scattered them across Tamriel, the staff was the only thing keeping Uriel Septim and Warhaft in &lt;a href=\"Oblivion\"&gt;Oblivion&lt;/a&gt;. A warrior escaped his clutches and traveled all corners of Tamriel to retrieve the missing pieces. The hero was known as the &lt;a href=\"Eternal%20Champion\"&gt;Eternal Champion&lt;/a&gt;, and he assembled the staff and defeated Jagar Tharn at the &lt;a href=\"Imperial%20Palace\"&gt;Imperial Palace&lt;/a&gt;. The Eternal Champion had at one point visited the town of Markarth Side in their quest to recover the pieces.\n&lt;a href=\"Fourth%20Era\"&gt;Fourth Era&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe Markarth Incident &amp; the Forsworn Uprising.\nDuring the &lt;a href=\"Great%20War\"&gt;Great War&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"4E%20174\"&gt;4E 174&lt;/a&gt;, the city-state of Markarth was ruled by &lt;a href=\"Jarl%20Hrolfdir\"&gt;Jarl Hrolfdir&lt;/a&gt;. With the arrival of the Great War, the &lt;a href=\"Imperial%20Legion\"&gt;Imperial Legion&lt;/a&gt; in Markarth had left for &lt;a href=\"Cyrodiil\"&gt;Cyrodiil&lt;/a&gt;, to fight against the &lt;a href=\"Third%20Aldmeri%20Dominion\"&gt;Third Aldmeri Dominion&lt;/a&gt;, leaving Markarth vulnerable to the &lt;a href=\"Reachmen\"&gt;Reachmen&lt;/a&gt;. Under the command of &lt;a href=\"Madanach\"&gt;Madanach&lt;/a&gt;, the King of Rags, the Reachmen overtook Markarth and established an independent kingdom, from 4E 174 to &lt;a href=\"4E%20176\"&gt;4E 176&lt;/a&gt;. Jarl Hrolfdir had escaped Markarth, seeking help to reclaim his domain. Jarl Hrolfdir sought help from &lt;a href=\"Ulfric%20Stormcloak\"&gt;Ulfric Stormcloak&lt;/a&gt;, the newly-proclaimed Jarl of &lt;a href=\"Windhelm\"&gt;Windhelm&lt;/a&gt;. In 4E 176, Ulfric, and his militia of warriors had stormed the walls of Markarth, deposing Madanach and reclaiming the city-state. Unfortunately, Hrolfdir had perished after the battle, failing to negotiate with the Reachmen. This had left the throne to his son, &lt;a href=\"Igmund\"&gt;Igmund&lt;/a&gt;. However, problems arose after what was known as the &lt;a href=\"Markarth%20Incident\"&gt;Markarth Incident&lt;/a&gt;, Ulfric agreed to help Hrolfdir if he allowed worship of &lt;a href=\"Talos\"&gt;Talos&lt;/a&gt;, despite the words set forth by the &lt;a href=\"White-Gold%20Concordat\"&gt;White-Gold Concordat&lt;/a&gt;. This part of the agreement did not last when the Thalmor returned and abolished the worship. Afterward, Ulfric and his militia were imprisoned for attempting to bring about Talos worship and enforcing law onto Markarth. This was a major driving point towards the &lt;a href=\"Skyrim%20Civil%20War\"&gt;Skyrim Civil War&lt;/a&gt;.\nMarkarth during the Skyrim Civil War.\nDuring the &lt;a href=\"Skyrim%20Civil%20War\"&gt;Skyrim Civil War&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"4E%20201\"&gt;4E 201&lt;/a&gt;, the city-state of Markarth was ruled by &lt;a href=\"Jarl%20Igmund\"&gt;Jarl Igmund&lt;/a&gt;, who inherited the throne from his late father, who perished sometime around the Markarth Incident. At this time, turmoil between the newly-founded &lt;a href=\"Forsworn\"&gt;Forsworn&lt;/a&gt; and Markarth had slowly decreased, but with Madanach imprisoned, relations between the Reachmen and the Nords are uneasy. With the Stormcloak Rebellion raging throughout Skyrim, Jarl Igmund sided with the &lt;a href=\"Mede%20Empire\"&gt;Mede Empire&lt;/a&gt;, despite Ulfric's actions at the Markarth Incident. The &lt;a href=\"Imperial%20Legion\"&gt;Imperial Legion&lt;/a&gt;, under the command of &lt;a href=\"General%20Tullius\"&gt;General Tullius&lt;/a&gt;, was stationed at the city-state of &lt;a href=\"Solitude\"&gt;Solitude&lt;/a&gt;, with the Legion in the Reach took hold at &lt;a href=\"Fort%20Sungard\"&gt;Fort Sungard&lt;/a&gt;, located in the Upper Karth. The Imperial Legion of the Reach was under the command of &lt;a href=\"Legate%20Emmanuel%20Admand\"&gt;Legate Emmanuel Admand&lt;/a&gt;, who operated out of Understone Keep, as a member of the Court of Markarth.\nThe Forsworn Conspiracy &amp; Madanach's Grand Plan.\nAt the same time, Madanach, the King of Rags, was imprisoned at Cidhna Mine, by order of &lt;a href=\"Thongvor%20Silver-Blood\"&gt;Thongvor Silver-Blood&lt;/a&gt;. With their leader in jail, the Forsworn had gone undercover throughout Markarth, most notably, attempted murder at the Markarth marketplace. While the City Guard tried to cover the situation, a &lt;a href=\"Reachmen\"&gt;Reachmen&lt;/a&gt; citizen, &lt;a href=\"Eltrys\"&gt;Eltrys&lt;/a&gt; and a &lt;a href=\"Last%20Dragonborn\"&gt;traveler&lt;/a&gt; had investigated the scene and interviewing people throughout Markarth. As time went on, noble elites from the &lt;a href=\"Silver-Bloods\"&gt;Silver-Blood Clan&lt;/a&gt; had begun to intervene, until it was revealed that Madanach had orchestrated events throughout town, having a deal with the Silver-Bloods. Eventually, Eltrys was disposed of, and the traveler was given a life sentence at Cidhna Mine. There they meet the Forsworn and converse with Madanach, who planned a prison outbreak. It is unknown what happened to Madanach, or if the traveler sided with him. Reports say that Madanach and his people had fled to &lt;a href=\"Druadach%20Redoubt\"&gt;Druadach Redoubt&lt;/a&gt;, while others say that &lt;a href=\"Thonar%20Silver-Blood\"&gt;Thonar Silver-Blood&lt;/a&gt; made a deal with the traveler, and sweeping all of this under the rug forever."}

It is known for its rich silver mines that use convict labour, which are mostly owned by the influential &lt;a href=\"Silver-Bloods\"&gt;Silver-Bloods&lt;/a&gt; family. The cutthroat intrigue surrounding Markarth's silver producing industry popularized the local saying, \"Blood and silver are what flows through Markarth...\" The city is located in the far west of Skyrim, in the mountains of &lt;a href=\"The%20Reach\"&gt;The Reach&lt;/a&gt;, west of the &lt;a href=\"Karth%20River\"&gt;Karth River&lt;/a&gt;. As a result, the city has a good natural defense, even from the skies. Being a long distance from any other major city and with both main roads cutting through mountains, valleys and rugged terrain, venturing to and from Markarth is one of the most treacherous trips for travelers.\nThe city is split by a large running river and comprises two parts: Riverside, where the native Reachmen and the working district are found; and the Dryside, housing all the houses of Nord nobles and Silver-Blood ownership. The Jarl's palace, &lt;a href=\"Understone%20Keep%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Understone Keep&lt;/a&gt;, is located at the top of the city and contains the &lt;a href=\"Hall%20of%20the%20Dead\"&gt;Hall of the Dead&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"Dwemer%20Museum\"&gt;Dwemer Museum&lt;/a&gt;, and the &lt;a href=\"Nchuand-Zel%20Excavation%20Site\"&gt;Nchuand-Zel Excavation Site&lt;/a&gt;\u00a0where the internal part of the old &lt;a href=\"Dwemer\"&gt;Dwemer&lt;/a&gt; city remains in ruins. Most of the city's residents tend to be quite unfriendly to outsiders.\nHistory.\nOrigins.\nMarkarth was the former city of &lt;a href=\"Nchuand-Zel%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Nchuand-Zel&lt;/a&gt;, belonging to the ancient &lt;a href=\"Dwemer\"&gt;Dwemer&lt;/a&gt; (also known as the Dwarves) who resided in &lt;a href=\"Morrowind\"&gt;Morrowind&lt;/a&gt;, Skyrim,\u00a0&lt;a href=\"Hammerfell\"&gt;Hammerfell&lt;/a&gt;\u00a0and\u00a0&lt;a href=\"High%20Rock\"&gt;High Rock&lt;/a&gt; during the &lt;a href=\"Merethic%20Era\"&gt;Merethic Era&lt;/a&gt;\u00a0and\u00a0&lt;a href=\"First%20Era\"&gt;First Era&lt;/a&gt;. Following the disappearance of the Dwemer from the face of &lt;a href=\"Nirn\"&gt;Nirn&lt;/a&gt; after they attempted to control the power of the &lt;a href=\"Numidium\"&gt;Numidium&lt;/a&gt;, Markarth was abandoned until the natives of the Reach known as &lt;a href=\"Reachmen\"&gt;Reachmen&lt;/a&gt;, moved into the city. The rise of &lt;a href=\"High%20King\"&gt;High King&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Olaf%20One-Eye\"&gt;Olaf One-Eye&lt;/a&gt;, who expanded &lt;a href=\"Skyrim\"&gt;Skyrim&lt;/a&gt;'s boundaries when he conquered &lt;a href=\"the%20Reach\"&gt;the Reach&lt;/a&gt;, saw that the city be turned over to &lt;a href=\"Nord\"&gt;Nord&lt;/a&gt; control.\nEstablishment.\nIn gratitude for the service of the &lt;a href=\"Tongues\"&gt;Tongues&lt;/a&gt; in Tamriel's long and complex history, Emperor &lt;a href=\"Tiber%20Septim\"&gt;Tiber Septim&lt;/a&gt; established the &lt;a href=\"Imperial%20College%20of%20the%20Voice\"&gt;Imperial College of the Voice&lt;/a&gt; in Markarth, which was dedicated to returning the Way of the Voice to the ancient and honorable art of war. So it may be that the mighty deeds of the Nord heroes of old will soon be equalled or surpassed on the battlefields of the present day. Unlike the other Dwemer cities and strongholds located in Morrowind, Hammerfell,High Rock and Skyrim, the city of Markarth was not constructed out of metal, but instead was primarily built out of stone. According to &lt;a href=\"Amanda%20Alleia\"&gt;Amanda Alleia&lt;/a&gt;, a mercenary in Markarth, Dwemer miners had cut out the city from the mountains, which probably means that the external part of the city that's outside of the mountains was built by the Dwemer themselves.\nThe Forsworn Uprising.\nIn &lt;a href=\"4E%20174\"&gt;4E 174&lt;/a&gt;, Markarth, and the Reach as a whole, were subjected to what is known today as the \"Forsworn Uprising.\" While the &lt;a href=\"Mede%20Empire\"&gt;Empire&lt;/a&gt; was beset by the &lt;a href=\"Third%20Aldmeri%20Dominion\"&gt;Third Aldmeri Dominion&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;a href=\"Great%20War\"&gt;Great War&lt;/a&gt;, the native people of the Reach, called the Reachmen, took this opportunity to seize control of the city. This was only possible as the &lt;a href=\"Imperial%20Legion%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Imperial Legionnaires&lt;/a&gt; stationed in Markarth were recalled to fight the forces of the Dominion, leaving the city highly vulnerable to conquest.\n&lt;a href=\"Jarl\"&gt;Jarl&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Igmund\"&gt;Igmund&lt;/a&gt;'s father, &lt;a href=\"Hrolfdir\"&gt;Hrolfdir&lt;/a&gt;, was Jarl at the time, but could not quell the uprising and was driven out of the city. The rebellion was successful and the Reachmen ruled over Markarth and The Reach as an independent kingdom from Skyrim from 4E 174\u2013176. According to one Imperial source, the kingdom was relatively peaceful during this time; the Reachmen allegedly ruled their lands fairly, and even made overtures to be recognized by the Empire as a legitimate kingdom. Others claimed that it was a chaotic uprising and that Markarth's nobles grew desperate when the Reachmen refused their offers of peace.\n&lt;a href=\"Markarth%20Incident\"&gt;Markarth Incident&lt;/a&gt;.\nDesperate to reclaim the Reach, Hrolfdir and his family enlisted the aid of &lt;a href=\"Ulfric%20Stormcloak%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Ulfric Stormcloak&lt;/a&gt; and his militia, promising them free worship of &lt;a href=\"Talos\"&gt;Talos&lt;/a&gt; in exchange for their assistance. Ulfric accepted, and his troops reconquered Markarth from the Reachmen soon after. The\u00a0returning Legion, coming back to restore order in Skyrim after the Great War, was refused entry into Markarth until they granted free Talos worship. The Empire accepted,\u00a0however, agents of the Aldmeri Dominion discovered the Empire was violating the terms of the &lt;a href=\"White-Gold%20Concordat\"&gt;White-Gold Concordat&lt;/a&gt;, and demanded the arrest of Ulfric and his men, or face another Great War between the Empire and the Dominion. The disillusionment of Ulfric and his men over what became known as the &lt;a href=\"Markarth%20Incident\"&gt;Markarth Incident&lt;/a&gt; would prove to become one of the direct causes of the &lt;a href=\"Skyrim%20Civil%20War\"&gt;Skyrim Civil War&lt;/a&gt; and be the foundation for the creation of the &lt;a href=\"Stormcloaks\"&gt;Stormcloaks&lt;/a&gt;.\nIn the aftermath of the Markarth Incident, the Reachmen took on the name of the &lt;a href=\"Forsworn\"&gt;Forsworn&lt;/a&gt; and fled to the highlands to continue their insurrection against the Nord nobles' control over the Reach and Markarth.\nResidence.\nWhen the Jarl approves the &lt;a href=\"Last%20Dragonborn\"&gt;Dragonborn&lt;/a&gt; after helping the people of Markarth, they become eligible to buy &lt;a href=\"Vlindrel%20Hall%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Vlindrel Hall&lt;/a&gt; for 8000 from his steward, &lt;a href=\"Raerek\"&gt;Raerek&lt;/a&gt;. Vlindrel, like the rest of the houses of Markarth, is built in the &lt;a href=\"Dwemer\"&gt;Dwemer&lt;/a&gt; architectural style with a large golden door leading into the cliffside. The house is the highest of every residences of Markarth and gives a great view of the city's buildings, waterfalls, and mountains of &lt;a href=\"The%20Reach\"&gt;The Reach&lt;/a&gt;.\nNearby points of interest.\nThe following is a list of some surrounding points of interest:"}

{"id": "58431", "revid": "17401442", "url": "https://elderscrolls.fandom.com/wiki?curid=58431", "title": "Markarth Incident", "text": "The Markarth Incident was a battle that took place after the &lt;a href=\"Great%20War\"&gt;Great War&lt;/a&gt; and before the &lt;a href=\"Civil%20War\"&gt;Civil War&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Skyrim\"&gt;Skyrim&lt;/a&gt;. Events in the city of &lt;a href=\"Markarth\"&gt;Markarth&lt;/a&gt; sparked the latter and later became known as the Markarth Incident.\nBackground.\nIn &lt;a href=\"4E%20174\"&gt;4E 174&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Markarth\"&gt;Markarth&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"the%20Reach\"&gt;the Reach&lt;/a&gt; was subjected to what is known today as the Forsworn Uprising. When the &lt;a href=\"Third%20Aldmeri%20Dominion\"&gt;Third Aldmeri Dominion&lt;/a&gt; invaded the &lt;a href=\"Imperial%20City\"&gt;Imperial City&lt;/a&gt; during the &lt;a href=\"Great%20War\"&gt;Great War&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"Imperial%20Legion%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Imperial Legion&lt;/a&gt; all but turned a blind eye to the other provinces. The native &lt;a href=\"Breton\"&gt;Breton&lt;/a&gt; people of the Reach, called the &lt;a href=\"Reachmen\"&gt;Reachmen&lt;/a&gt;, took this opportunity to seize control of the city. This was only possible as the &lt;a href=\"Imperial%20Legion\"&gt;Imperial Legion&lt;/a&gt;naires stationed in Markarth were recalled to fight, leaving the city very vulnerable.\nThe Jarl of the Reach, &lt;a href=\"Hrolfdir\"&gt;Hrolfdir&lt;/a&gt;, could not quell the uprising and was driven out of the city. The rebellion was successful, and the Reachmen ruled over Markarth and The Reach as an independent kingdom from Skyrim from 4E 174 - 4E 176. Allegedly during this time, the Kingdom was relatively peaceful, and the Reachmen ruled their lands more or less fairly and were making overtures to be recognized by the Empire as a legitimate kingdom. Others claimed that it was a chaotic uprising and that Markarth's nobles grew desperate when the Reachmen refused their offers of peace.\nRetaliation.\nIn &lt;a href=\"4E%20175\"&gt;4E 175&lt;/a&gt;, the Great War ended with the Empire signing the &lt;a href=\"White-Gold%20Concordat\"&gt;White-Gold Concordat&lt;/a&gt;. During this time, Hrolfdir and his son &lt;a href=\"Igmund\"&gt;Igmund&lt;/a&gt; sought help from &lt;a href=\"Ulfric%20Stormcloak%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Ulfric Stormcloak&lt;/a&gt; in ousting the Reachmen invaders. They promised Ulfric that if he re-took the Reach, then Hrolfdir as Jarl would allow free worship of &lt;a href=\"Talos\"&gt;Talos&lt;/a&gt; - an act that was recently outlawed at the end of the war. Ulfric agreed and marched his militia to the gates of Markarth and retook the city using the power of his &lt;a href=\"Thu%27um\"&gt;Thu'um&lt;/a&gt;.\nReports vary, but \"&lt;a href=\"The%20Bear%20of%20Markarth\"&gt;The Bear of Markarth&lt;/a&gt;\" claims every official who worked for the Reachmen was killed, even after they had surrendered, native women were tortured to give up names of Reachmen fighters who had fled the city and anyone who lived in the city, Reachmen and Nord alike, were executed if they had not fought with Ulfric and his men when they breached the gates. Ulfric supposedly even ordered the deaths of shopkeepers, farmers, the elderly, and any child old enough to lift a sword that had failed in the call to fight with him.\nIt is difficult to tell how accurate these reports are, as while the dialogue of &lt;a href=\"Braig\"&gt;Braig&lt;/a&gt; and many of the other Forsworn imprisoned in &lt;a href=\"Cidhna%20Mine\"&gt;Cidhna Mine&lt;/a&gt; shows that there were many false and unjust imprisonments, the number of these are unknown. Although the Empire accuses Ulfric of being responsible for the heinous atrocities, Braig's story seems to confirm that it was Jarl Hrolfdir who carried out the unjust incarcerations and executions on those accused of colluding with the Forsworn. This is however, partially, contradicted by &lt;a href=\"Nepos%20the%20Nose\"&gt;Nepos the Nose&lt;/a&gt;, who claims that all the Forsworn who did not flee were executed, excluding himself, his king and a handful of others.\nThe leader of the Reachmen, &lt;a href=\"Madanach\"&gt;Madanach&lt;/a&gt;, was captured but was spared by &lt;a href=\"Thonar%20Silver-Blood\"&gt;Thonar Silver-Blood&lt;/a&gt;, as he was more valuable as alive than dead. The surviving Reachmen fled to the hills of the Reach and became known as the &lt;a href=\"Forsworn\"&gt;Forsworn&lt;/a&gt;.\nAftermath.\nIn Markarth, Jarl Hrolfdir kept his promise to Ulfric for a time and allowed free worship of Talos. When the Imperial Legion arrived to restore the rule of law, Ulfric allegedly refused them entry into the city until they also agreed that free worship of Talos would be allowed. With supposed chaos running through the streets of Markarth and the reports of deaths rising every day, the Empire had no choice but to grant Ulfric and his men their worship, thus jeopardizing the peace agreement with the Aldmeri Dominion. Igmund and &lt;a href=\"Cedran\"&gt;Cedran&lt;/a&gt; however, implies that the Empire promised Ulfric free Talos worship from the very beginning and simply hoped that the Dominion would not find out about the free Talos worship. When they eventually did, they scapegoated Ulfric and his militia in order to avoid incrimination and to prevent a war.\nEventually, the Empire rescinded upon the agreement due to pressure from the Aldmeri Dominion. Hrolfdir turned on Ulfric and his men and aided the Empire in arresting them. Ulfric and his militia were expelled from the city and imprisoned shortly after. This betrayal left Ulfric bitter towards the Empire and is considered to be the initial conception of the &lt;a href=\"Stormcloak\"&gt;Stormcloak&lt;/a&gt; rebellion."}

Marriage is practiced by almost all of the cultures of &lt;a href=\"Tamriel\"&gt;Tamriel&lt;/a&gt; with the teachings of the goddess &lt;a href=\"Mara\"&gt;Mara&lt;/a&gt;, and her different identities throughout various societies, being the most prevalent among &lt;a href=\"Men\"&gt;Men&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Mer\"&gt;Mer&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Beastfolk\"&gt;Beastfolk&lt;/a&gt;.\nAs well as Mara, whose marriages are centered around the religious institutions of the &lt;a href=\"Nine%20Divines\"&gt;Eight and Nine Divines&lt;/a&gt;, marriage serves as a component of other cultures including &lt;a href=\"Argonian\"&gt;Argonian&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Dunmer\"&gt;Dunmer&lt;/a&gt;i, and &lt;a href=\"Orsimer\"&gt;Orsimer&lt;/a&gt;i societies centered around various deities with different practices and for different purposes.\nEight and Nine Divines traditions.\nMost of the &lt;a href=\"races\"&gt;races&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"Tamriel\"&gt;Tamriel&lt;/a&gt; practice marriage according to the teachings and traditions of the Eight and Nine Divines, specifically according to Mara, the goddess of maternity and love and patron of marriages, known also as &lt;a href=\"Morwha\"&gt;Morwha&lt;/a&gt; by the &lt;a href=\"Yokudan\"&gt;Yokudan&lt;/a&gt;s. Marriages of this kind are officiated and overseen by priests and priestesses of Mara, often in a temple of Mara where others gather to witness the vows of marriage. Priests and priestesses may also provide the &lt;a href=\"Pledge%20of%20Mara\"&gt;Pledge of Mara&lt;/a&gt; to couples for them to perform the &lt;a href=\"Ritual%20of%20Mara\"&gt;Ritual of Mara&lt;/a&gt;. It has also been reported that clans of &lt;a href=\"Ayleid\"&gt;Ayleids&lt;/a&gt; not affiliated with any &lt;a href=\"Daedra\"&gt;Daedra&lt;/a&gt;, some Falmer before their exile from the surface and subsequent corruption, and &lt;a href=\"Kothringi\"&gt;Kothringi&lt;/a&gt; practiced marriages according to the traditions of Mara worship.\nAltmeri culture.\nMarriage in Altmeri culture, mainly on the &lt;a href=\"Summerset%20Isles\"&gt;Summerset Isles&lt;/a&gt;, is often subject to strict social observation and traditionalism compared to external practice, as the prime focus of an Altmeri marriage is the continuation of a strong and pure lineage with a proud sense of heritage. As such, Altmeri marriages are often arranged and lack any sense of passion or love. The 'highborn' of Altmer society are expected to seek spiritual guidance from the stars and the gods so as to divine anything from the suitability of a future union to the very date of the wedding. This practice of religious communion to ensure the success of a marriage often lasts for years and sometimes decades.\nThe massive importance placed on marriages in Altmer society creates both extreme pressure for those expected to marry as well as a social stigma for those who avoid marriage or terminate an existing matrimonial relationship to the point where one may be completely ostracised from their family and community. Although they are generally frowned upon by society, interclass marriages are allowed. Because pureness of blood and lineage is the most important factor considered in Altmeri marriages, &lt;a href=\"werewolf\"&gt;werewolves&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"vampire\"&gt;vampire&lt;/a&gt;s are not allowed to marry, either each other or a non-werewolf or vampire and such married individuals have been reported to have committed suicide or murder to preserve the integrity of their family's name."}

After obtaining the &lt;a href=\"Amulet%20of%20Mara%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Amulet of Mara&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"Last%20Dragonborn\"&gt;Dragonborn&lt;/a&gt; has the option to engage in marriage with an eligible character. There are no eligible &lt;a href=\"Khajiit%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Khajiit&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Bosmer%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Bosmer&lt;/a&gt;, male &lt;a href=\"Redguards%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Redguard&lt;/a&gt;, or male &lt;a href=\"Altmer%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Altmer&lt;/a&gt; candidates. Those that can be married generally require that a specific task be completed beforehand. Whether the partner is a &lt;a href=\"Merchants%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;merchant&lt;/a&gt; or not, after marriage, they are able to purchase and sell general goods, also allowing the Dragonborn to collect a daily portion of their profits from their \"work.\" Every 24 hours, the Dragonborn can ask their spouse how business is faring to receive a share of 100 . If the share is not collected, the gold accumulates.\nMarrying.\nProposing.\nMaramal must be asked about marriage in Skyrim before any dialogue related to the Amulet of Mara shows up.\nThe new dialogue is unlocked with certain characters if the Dragonborn is both wearing the amulet and has met the requirement relating to the individual, usually a quest. The Dragonborn can then express their wish to marry the person. Once that is done, they can speak to Maramal at the Temple of Mara about arranging the wedding.\nWedding ceremony.\nThe ceremony will start no sooner than approximately 24 hours. one of the easiest ways to make time move faster is to rent a room at the bee and the barb and sleep there for 24 hours. Maramal alludes to the ceremony time being constrained between dawn and dusk; however, the ceremony can happen at any given hour of the day. During the ceremony, the Dragonborn has one last chance to affirm the marriage before the ceremony proceeds. Upon accepting the marriage, Maramal makes the marriage official and gives the Dragonborn &lt;a href=\"The%20Bond%20of%20Matrimony\"&gt;The Bond of Matrimony&lt;/a&gt;.\nCharacters for whom quests have previously been completed or other characters who disposition is positive may appear at the wedding ceremony as guests. If the Dragonborn already owns any houses, then the corresponding &lt;a href=\"housecarl\"&gt;housecarl&lt;/a&gt;(s) may also be present. In the case of a few potential spouses, characters who are important to that character may appear as well.\nIf the Dragonborn misses their wedding ceremony, they can approach the intended partner and ask for another chance. Maramal will then agree to host another ceremony, the next day.\nMarried life.\nOnce the marriage ceremony is complete and the Dragonborn addresses their new spouse, the spouse will inquire where the Dragonborn wants to live. If the spouse owns property, that will be presented as an option; the Dragonborn may also select any of the &lt;a href=\"Houses%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;house&lt;/a&gt;(s) they currently own. The selection need not be permanent; relocation to any of the available homes is available at any time by initiating the appropriate dialogue with the spouse.\nIf the spouse is the Dragonborn's housecarl, \"their house\" is the applicable house of the Dragonborn that they are responsible for.\nOnce married, the behavior of the spouse changes. Most notably, the tone of voice and behavior changes and they will often refer to the Dragonborn as \"love\" or \"dear\" from that point on. However, if the Dragonborn marries one of their housecarls, the Dragonborn will still be referred to as \"my &lt;a href=\"Thane%20%28Title%29\"&gt;Thane&lt;/a&gt;\" using subordinate dialogue.\nIf the Dragonborn's spouse relocates to a different city from where they originated to live in one of the Dragonborn's houses, they may indicate that they wish to become a shop owner to keep occupied while the Dragonborn is out adventuring.\nOnce a day, the Dragonborn can ask their spouse to cook something. The spouse will make a &lt;a href=\"Homecooked%20Meal\"&gt;homemade meal&lt;/a&gt;, which increases the regeneration of &lt;a href=\"Magicka%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Magicka&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Health%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Health&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Stamina%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Stamina&lt;/a&gt;.\nIf the Dragonborn sleeps in the house with the spouse, the Dragonborn will receive a temporary bonus called \"&lt;a href=\"Lover%27s%20Comfort\"&gt;Lover's Comfort&lt;/a&gt;\" that boosts the rate of skill-learning by 15% for 8 hours. However, this bonus cannot be obtained if &lt;a href=\"the%20Lover%20Stone%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;the Lover Stone&lt;/a&gt; is activated (a workaround can be used with the &lt;a href=\"Aetherial%20Crown\"&gt;Aetherial Crown&lt;/a&gt;), or if the Blood Ritual has been taken to become a &lt;a href=\"Lycanthropy%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Werewolf&lt;/a&gt;.\nIf the &lt;a href=\"Official%20Add-ons%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Official Plug-in&lt;/a&gt; is installed, marriage can also include children. The Dragonborn's &lt;a href=\"adopt\"&gt;adopt&lt;/a&gt;ed child will also be adopted by the spouse, as well as instantly move into the house where the Dragonborn's new son or daughter is living. This adds another dialogue option with the spouse allowing the Dragonborn to ask how the children are; it also adds generic dialogue to the child, where an activity will be mentioned that they both did together.\n\"Note:\" Because spouses act as vendors, the Dragonborn can buy and sell items from them. However, if the spouse is a &lt;a href=\"Followers%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;follower&lt;/a&gt; and asked to follow the Dragonborn, the spouse will only sell items from their inventory until they part ways. Spouses only act as merchants in the marital home, meaning items cannot be sold to them while they are following (to reduce the carry weight, for instance).\nForcing marriage.\nThe marriage dialog option can be forced to appear on characters by opening the console, targeting the desired character, and typing the &lt;a href=\"Console%20Commands%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;command&lt;/a&gt; \"codice_1.\" This could possibly cause issues with characters who were not originally intended to have this option.\nA friendship must have been started with the character in the form of a quest, as their disposition (which is a hidden stat) needs to be of a certain level in order for them to recognize the Amulet of Mara. Alternatively the command \"codice_2\" can be used after adding the person to the marriage faction. It is not possible to marry several of the people in the game, such as &lt;a href=\"Ulfric%20Stormcloak%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Ulfric Stormcloak&lt;/a&gt;.\nDivorce.\nTrying to breakup with partners is impossible without the &lt;a href=\"Console%20Commands%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;console commands&lt;/a&gt;. Searching for codice_4 will bring up dialogue and quests that show reference to what most likely was the original intention of breaking up with a spouse.\nOption one.\nThe relationshipbreakup quest can be used. Use the console to enter these commands:\nThe above will prevent the Dragonborn from having to kill their spouse, although they will comment on how much even the thought of them makes their blood boil. Untested, but possibly codice_2 can fix this."}

The 22nd and last heir of the &lt;a href=\"Septim%20Dynasty\"&gt;Septim Dynasty&lt;/a&gt;, Septim plays a major role in the events of . After &lt;a href=\"Mythic%20Dawn\"&gt;multiple targeted attacks on the Septim royal bloodline&lt;/a&gt;, leading to the assassination of Uriel Septim VII and all other royal heirs, Septim was found and coronated too late to rekindle the Imperial &lt;a href=\"Dragonfires\"&gt;Dragonfires&lt;/a&gt;. All barriers between &lt;a href=\"Oblivion\"&gt;Oblivion&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Mundus\"&gt;Mundus&lt;/a&gt; were destroyed, &lt;a href=\"Mehrunes%20Dagon\"&gt;Mehrunes Dagon&lt;/a&gt; leading the invasion with a massive army of &lt;a href=\"Daedra\"&gt;Daedra&lt;/a&gt;. As a last-ditch effort to stop the invasion, Septim shattered the ancient &lt;a href=\"Amulet%20of%20Kings\"&gt;Amulet of Kings&lt;/a&gt; and became an &lt;a href=\"Avatar%20of%20Akatosh%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;Avatar&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"Akatosh\"&gt;Akatosh&lt;/a&gt;. Defeating Dagon in combat and banishing his Daedra, Septim was immortalized as a statue of Akatosh in the remains of the &lt;a href=\"Temple%20of%20the%20One\"&gt;Temple of the One&lt;/a&gt;, replacing the original Dragonfires and representing a new barrier against Oblivion.\nHistory.\nEarly life.\nSeptim was born an illegitimate child to Uriel Septim VII and an unknown mistress. Uriel could not raise the child and trusted Jauffre with spiriting him away as an infant. Uriel still asked Jauffre for updates on Septim's whereabouts but never met with the boy anytime after he was given up. Septim was unaware of this for most of his life.\nIn his youth, he grew up believing that his father was a farmer and his mother had died giving birth to him. Early in his life, he discovered the seductiveness of Daedric magic and practiced it daily. Septim joined the &lt;a href=\"Daedric%20Cult\"&gt;Daedric Cult&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"Sanguine\"&gt;Sanguine&lt;/a&gt;. Septim briefly possessed the &lt;a href=\"Sanguine%20Rose\"&gt;Sanguine Rose&lt;/a&gt; during that time and noted that he and his friends got in over their heads, with some of his friends dying in a disastrous accident. Later, a priest converted Septim to worship the &lt;a href=\"Nine%20Divines\"&gt;Nine Divines&lt;/a&gt; and he became a priest at the Chapel of Akatosh in &lt;a href=\"Kvatch\"&gt;Kvatch&lt;/a&gt;.\nOblivion Crisis.\nFollowing the death of his father and half-brothers by the Mythic Dawn's assassins, Septim was the only remaining heir of the Septim Dynasty. Unaware that he was an heir, Septim was sought out by the &lt;a href=\"Hero%20of%20Kvatch\"&gt;Hero of Kvatch&lt;/a&gt; on orders of &lt;a href=\"Jauffre%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;Jauffre&lt;/a&gt;, Grandmaster of the Blades. Found and informed of his true heritage, he agreed to flee to safety and help prevent the oncoming daedric invasion of the mortal world.\nSoon after Septim's discovery, the Amulet of Kings was stolen by members of the Mythic Dawn, a daedric cult based within &lt;a href=\"Cyrodiil\"&gt;Cyrodiil&lt;/a&gt;. To safeguard Septim, Jauffre relocates him to the fortress of the Blades, known as &lt;a href=\"Cloud%20Ruler%20Temple\"&gt;Cloud Ruler Temple&lt;/a&gt;, where he also offers to make the Hero of Kvatch a member of the Blades.\nA failed attempt by the Hero to recover the Amulet of Kings from Mankar Camoran yields the \"&lt;a href=\"Mysterium%20Xarxes\"&gt;Mysterium Xarxes&lt;/a&gt;\", the holy book of the Mythic Dawn cult and a tome of massive dark power. However, it was slow, painstaking work, and it took much research to deduce Mythic Dawn's plans.\nEventually, Septim determined that the book could be used to open a portal to Camoran's &lt;a href=\"Paradise%20%28Location%29\"&gt;Paradise&lt;/a&gt; and that four other items were required. Any Daedric artifact, the blood of one of the &lt;a href=\"Nine%20Divines\"&gt;Nine Divines&lt;/a&gt; (obtained from the armor of &lt;a href=\"Tiber%20Septim\"&gt;Tiber Septim&lt;/a&gt;, in which he fought and bled before his &lt;a href=\"Apotheosis%20%28Term%29\"&gt;Apotheosis&lt;/a&gt;), a great welkynd stone, and a &lt;a href=\"Great%20Sigil%20Stone%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;great sigil stone&lt;/a&gt;. The Hero obtained the first three objects on their own, but the last could only be obtained by allowing the Mythic Dawn to open a &lt;a href=\"Great%20Gate\"&gt;Great Gate&lt;/a&gt; (which requires three minor Oblivion gates to open) outside of &lt;a href=\"Bruma\"&gt;Bruma&lt;/a&gt;. This could potentially destroy Bruma. Septim donned the armor of Tiber Septim and led a &lt;a href=\"Defense%20of%20Bruma%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;Defense of Bruma&lt;/a&gt;, deliberately allowing the opening of the gate and buying the Hero time to secure the stone.\nWith the four objects in hand, Septim bound himself temporarily to the \"Mysterium Xarxes\" and opened a portal to Paradise. The Hero of Kvatch entered, killed Camoran, and returned with the Amulet of Kings, presenting it to Septim. During this raid, Septim sent the Blade &lt;a href=\"Baurus\"&gt;Baurus&lt;/a&gt; to the Imperial Palace to formally present his claim to the throne to Chancellor &lt;a href=\"Ocato%20of%20Firsthold\"&gt;Ocato of Firsthold&lt;/a&gt;, who, with the &lt;a href=\"Elder%20Council\"&gt;Elder Council&lt;/a&gt;, accepted the claim.\nArriving at the Imperial Palace with the Hero and Jauffre, Septim was about to be formally recognized as Emperor by Ocato when a massive daedric invasion erupts within the &lt;a href=\"Imperial%20City\"&gt;Imperial City&lt;/a&gt;. Septim, Ocato, the Hero, the Blades, and numerous &lt;a href=\"Imperial%20Guard\"&gt;Imperial Guard&lt;/a&gt;s fought their way to the Temple of the One to relight the Dragonfires. However, they were too late; Mehrunes Dagon himself has entered Tamriel. Lighting the Dragonfires is pointless, as they merely maintained the barriers between Mundus and Oblivion.\nA despaired Septim turns to the Hero and a brief conversation ensues, during which the Hero asks, \"What about the Amulet of Kings?\" Septim was inspired by the question, and ordered the Hero to lead him to the Temple. Upon their arrival, the Hero and Septim bid each other farewell. Septim destroyed the Amulet of Kings, binding his blood with that of the gods held within the central gem, and became an Avatar of Akatosh. He became the form of an enormous dragon wreathed in flame, as Dagon smashed the Temple Dome. Septim then destroys Mehrunes Dagon's physical body, banishing him back to the &lt;a href=\"Planes%20of%20Oblivion\"&gt;Wastes of Oblivion&lt;/a&gt;, but not without sustaining a mortal wound himself. The Dragon landed, arched its neck, roared into the sky, and was immortalized as a statue in the Temple.\nSoon after this event, Ocato of Firsthold stated that Septim would be remembered as the last and greatest Septim, and claimed that he would have been a great Emperor. As he died childless, like all of his brothers, the Line of the Septims was completely defunct, with Ocato becoming &lt;a href=\"Potentate\"&gt;Potentate&lt;/a&gt; of the Empire. The nature of Septim's sacrifice ensures that an Emperor is no longer necessary to maintain the barriers between the worlds.\nWith Septim dead and the Septim line ended, the &lt;a href=\"Third%20Era\"&gt;Third Era&lt;/a&gt; ended. As the Septims were the &lt;a href=\"Dragonborn\"&gt;Dragonborn&lt;/a&gt; line of Emperors, the ending of this bloodline fulfills the prophecy of the &lt;a href=\"Elder%20Scrolls\"&gt;Elder Scrolls&lt;/a&gt; that foretells the return of &lt;a href=\"Alduin\"&gt;Alduin&lt;/a&gt;, and the coming of the &lt;a href=\"Last%20Dragonborn\"&gt;Last Dragonborn&lt;/a&gt; which continues in the events of .\nPersonality and characteristics.\nSeptim was humble, softly spoken, and compassionate. Although he appeared meek, or at least not someone one would usually pay attention to, Septim possessed a strong will and steely resolve. Untrusting of the Hero at first, he soon proves himself to be warm and courteous, making an effort to treat everyone equally, even as his claim as Emperor becomes stronger and his position more stable throughout the events of the story.\nSeptim possessed a strong mind, and was exceptionally intelligent; he almost constantly was in study, and managed to open a portal to Paradise where others could not. Furthermore, he is exceedingly brave; he does not hesitate to bind himself to the portal to Paradise, and leads the Defense of Bruma with little to no hesitation, despite the fact he has never fought in battle before.\nPerhaps Septim's greatest weakness is his insecurity. It plagues him during the game, the idea that he might not be good enough, undermining his work, and his past haunts him, adding to the slightly cold, reserved air he occasionally keeps around himself as protection. However, Septim possessed the wisdom to learn from his mistakes and ensure they do not happen again. Finally, Septim has superb combat abilities. He can wield impressive magic, and on several occasions demonstrates a natural proficiency with a dagger and a sword, no doubt a trait passed down from Tiber Septim himself, and somewhat prominent in the Septim bloodline."}

After the &lt;a href=\"Oblivion%20Gate%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;Oblivion Gates&lt;/a&gt; open, make sure to keep Martin alive until the Hero can enter the Great Gate. If Martin dies, the main questline cannot be completed.\n&lt;a href=\"Great%20Gate\"&gt;Great Gate&lt;/a&gt;.\nMehrunes Dagon has opened three lesser gates outside Bruma and is opening a Great Gate, like the one that destroyed Kvatch. The Hero must stop the &lt;a href=\"Daedric%20siege%20crawler\"&gt;Daedric siege crawler&lt;/a&gt; from exiting the gate.\n&lt;a href=\"Paradise%20%28Quest%29\"&gt;Paradise&lt;/a&gt;.\nAll four of the necessary items have been collected, and Martin opens the gate to &lt;a href=\"Mankar%20Camoran%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;Mankar Camoran&lt;/a&gt;'s Paradise, &lt;a href=\"Gaiar%20Alata\"&gt;Gaiar Alata&lt;/a&gt;.\n&lt;a href=\"Light%20the%20Dragonfires\"&gt;Light the Dragonfires&lt;/a&gt;.\nAfter escorting Martin to the &lt;a href=\"Temple%20of%20the%20One\"&gt;Temple of the One&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Mehrunes%20Dagon\"&gt;Mehrunes Dagon&lt;/a&gt; will invade the &lt;a href=\"Imperial%20City%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;Imperial City&lt;/a&gt;. Due to the crisis threatening all of &lt;a href=\"Tamriel\"&gt;Tamriel&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Nirn\"&gt;Nirn&lt;/a&gt;, Martin bids the Hero farewell before smashing the &lt;a href=\"Amulet%20of%20Kings%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;Amulet of Kings&lt;/a&gt;. An &lt;a href=\"Avatar%20of%20Akatosh%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;avatar&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"Akatosh\"&gt;Akatosh&lt;/a&gt; appears and fuses with Martin, which then battles Mehrunes Dagon firsthand.\nHistory.\nEarly life.\nMartin was born an illegitimate child to Uriel Septim VII and an unknown mistress. Uriel could not raise the child, and trusted Jauffre with spiriting him away as an infant. Uriel still asked Jauffre for updates on Martin's whereabouts, but never met with the boy anytime after he was given up. Martin was unaware of any of this for most of his life.\nIn his youth, he grew up believing that his father was a farmer and his mother had died giving birth to him. Early on in his life, he discovered the seductiveness of Daedric magic, practicing it and using it on a daily basis. Martin joined the &lt;a href=\"Daedric%20Cult\"&gt;Daedric Cult&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"Sanguine\"&gt;Sanguine&lt;/a&gt;. During that time, Martin briefly came into possession of the &lt;a href=\"Sanguine%20Rose\"&gt;Sanguine Rose&lt;/a&gt;.\nMartin notes that he and his friends got in over their heads and some of his friends died in a disastrous accident. Later, a priest managed to convert Martin to the worship of the &lt;a href=\"Nine%20Divines\"&gt;Nine Divines&lt;/a&gt;. He became a priest at the Chapel of Akatosh in Kvatch.\nOblivion Crisis.\nFollowing the death of his father and half-brothers by Mythic Dawn assassins, Martin is the only remaining &lt;a href=\"Septim%20Dynasty\"&gt;Septim&lt;/a&gt;. Unaware that he is the sole remaining heir to the Septim throne, Martin is sought out by the &lt;a href=\"Hero%20of%20Kvatch\"&gt;Hero of Kvatch&lt;/a&gt;. Upon being found and informed of his true heritage, he helps to end the &lt;a href=\"Daedra\"&gt;Daedra&lt;/a&gt; invasion of the mortal world.\nSoon after Martin's discovery, the Amulet of Kings\u00a0is stolen by members of the Mythic Dawn, a Daedra cult based within &lt;a href=\"Cyrodiil\"&gt;Cyrodiil&lt;/a&gt;, who were also responsible for the invasion. To safeguard Martin, Jauffre, grandmaster of the &lt;a href=\"Blades%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;Blades&lt;/a&gt;, takes him to the fortress of the Blades, known as Cloud Ruler Temple, where he also offers to make the Hero of Kvatch a member of the Blades.\nA failed attempt by the Hero to recover the Amulet of Kings from Mankar Camoran\u00a0yields the \"Mysterium Xarxes\", the holy book of the Mythic Dawn cult and a tome of massive dark power. However, it is slow, painstaking work, taking much research.\nEventually, Martin determines that the book could be used to open a portal to Camoran's Paradise and that four other items are needed to do this. These include any Daedric artifact, the blood of one of the Nine Divines (obtained from the armor of &lt;a href=\"Tiber%20Septim\"&gt;Tiber Septim&lt;/a&gt;, in which he had fought and bled before his &lt;a href=\"Apotheosis%20%28Term%29\"&gt;Apotheosis&lt;/a&gt;), a great welkynd stone, and a &lt;a href=\"Great%20Sigil%20Stone%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;great sigil stone&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe Hero obtains the first three objects on his own but the last may be obtained only by allowing the Mythic Dawn to open a Great Gate (which requires three minor Oblivion gates to open) outside of &lt;a href=\"Bruma%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;Bruma&lt;/a&gt;. This could potentially cause the destruction of Bruma. Martin dons the armor of Tiber Septim and leads a &lt;a href=\"Defense%20of%20Bruma%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;Defense of Bruma&lt;/a&gt;, deliberately allowing the opening of the gate and buying the Hero time to secure the stone.\nThe four objects in hand, Martin binds himself temporarily to the \"Xarxes\"\u00a0and opens a portal to Paradise. The Hero of Kvatch enters, kills Camoran, and returns with the Amulet of Kings, presenting it to Martin.\nDuring this raid, Martin sends the Blade &lt;a href=\"Baurus\"&gt;Baurus&lt;/a&gt; to the Imperial Palace to formally present his claim to the throne to Chancellor &lt;a href=\"Ocato%20of%20Firsthold\"&gt;Ocato of Firsthold&lt;/a&gt;, who, with the &lt;a href=\"Elder%20Council\"&gt;Elder Council&lt;/a&gt;, considers and accepts the claim.\nArriving at the Imperial Palace with the Hero and Jauffre, Martin is about to be formally recognized as Emperor by Ocato when a massive Daedric invasion erupts within the &lt;a href=\"Imperial%20City%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;Imperial City&lt;/a&gt;. Martin, Ocato, the Hero, the Blades, and numerous Imperial Guards fight their way to the &lt;a href=\"Temple%20of%20the%20One\"&gt;Temple of the One&lt;/a&gt; District to relight the &lt;a href=\"Dragonfires\"&gt;Dragonfires&lt;/a&gt;.\nHowever, they are too late;\u00a0&lt;a href=\"Mehrunes%20Dagon\"&gt;Mehrunes Dagon&lt;/a&gt; himself has entered Tamriel. Lighting the Dragonfires is pointless, as they had merely maintained the barriers between Mundus and Oblivion.\nA despairing Martin turns to the Hero and a brief conversation ensues, during which the Hero asks, \"What about the Amulet of Kings?\" Martin is inspired by the question and orders the champion to lead him to the Temple.\nUpon their arrival, the Hero and Martin bid each other farewell. Martin then shatters the Amulet of Kings, binding his blood with that of the kings and gods held within the central gem of the amulet, in order to become the avatar of\u00a0Akatosh; he takes the form of a giant dragon wreathed in flame. Dagon smashes the Temple Dome as Martin transforms. The Dragon then destroys Mehrunes Dagon's physical body, banishing him back to the Wastes of Oblivion, but not without sustaining a mortal wound itself. After the fight ends, the Dragon arches its neck, roars into the sky and is petrified, becoming a statue.\nSoon after this event, Ocato of Firsthold states that Martin would be remembered as the last and greatest Septim, and goes on to say that Martin would have been a great Emperor. As Martin died childless, like all of his brothers, the Line of the Septims is completely defunct. The nature of Martin's sacrifice ensures that an Emperor is no longer necessary to maintain the barriers between the worlds; however, the fate of Martin himself remains unknown.\nWith Martin dead and the Septim line ended, the Third Era ends but a new one dawns. As the Septims were the Dragonborn line of Emperors, the ending of this bloodline fulfills the prophecy of the Elder Scrolls that foretells the return of &lt;a href=\"Alduin\"&gt;Alduin&lt;/a&gt;, and the coming of the &lt;a href=\"Last%20Dragonborn\"&gt;Last Dragonborn&lt;/a&gt; which continues in the events of .\nPersonality and characteristics.\nMartin was humble, softly spoken and compassionate. Although at first he appeared to be somewhat slightly meek, or at least not someone one would usually pay attention to, Martin possessed a strong will and steely resolve. Although (understandably) untrusting of the Hero at first, he soon warms up, and\u00a0proves\u00a0to be warm and courteous,\u00a0while making an effort to treat everyone equally, even as\u00a0his claim as Emperor becomes stronger and his position more stable throughout the events of the story.\nMartin also possesses a very strong mind, and is exceptionally intelligent; he reads almost constantly when he can, and manages to open a portal to Paradise where others could not. Furthermore, Martin is extremely brave; he does not hesitate to bind himself to the portal to Paradise, and leads the Defense of Bruma with little to no hesitation, despite the\u00a0fact he has never fought a battle before.\nPerhaps Martin's greatest weakness is his insecurity. It plagues him during the game, the idea that he might not be good\u00a0enough, undermining his\u00a0work, and his past haunts him,\u00a0adding to the slightly cold, reserved air he occasionally keeps around himself as protection.\u00a0But Martin also possesses\u00a0wisdom to learn from his mistakes, and ensure they do not happen again. Finally, Martin has\u00a0superb combat abilities. He can wield impressive magic, and on several occasions demonstrates a natural proficiency with a dagger and a sword, no doubt a trait passed down from Tiber Septim himself, and somewhat prominent in the Septim bloodline.\nConversations.\n&lt;a href=\"Cloud%20Ruler%20Temple%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;Cloud Ruler Temple&lt;/a&gt;.\nCyrus: \"Grandmaster, is this ... ?\"\nJauffre: \"Yes, Cyrus. This is the Emperor's son. Martin Septim.\"\nCyrus: \"My lord! Welcome to Cloud Ruler Temple! We have not had the honor of an Emperor's visit in in many years!\"\nMartin: \"Ah, well, thank you! The honor is mine.\"\nJauffre: \"Come. Your Blades are waiting to greet you.\"\nHailing Martin Septim.\nJauffre: \"Blades! Dark times are upon us. The Emperor and his sons were slain on our watch.

You will be safe here until you can take up your throne.\"\nMartin: \"Jauffre. All of you. I know you all expect me to be Emperor. I'll do my best. But this is all new to me. I'm not used to giving speeches. But I wanted you to know that I appreciate your welcome here. I hope I prove myself worthy of your loyalty in the coming days. That's it. Thank you.\"\nJauffre: \"Well, then. Thank you, Martin. We'd all best get back to our duties, eh, Captain?\"\nDefense of Bruma.\nJauffre: \"With all due respect, sire, there must be another way. The risk is too great!\"\nMartin Septim: \"I know the risk. I was at Kvatch. But there is no other way. We have no choice.\"\nJauffre: \"The Countess will never agree to it...\"\nMartin Septim: \"She will. She must.\"\nJauffre: \"Very well. The Blades are, as always, at your disposal.\"\nThe Great Sigil Stone.\nCountess Narina Carvain: \"Your Highness? I am Narina Carvain, Countess of Bruma, at your service.\"\nMartin Septim: \"There is no need for any formality at this time. I am not Emperor yet. And I am quite new to this notion of being heir to the throne. Thank you for coming. I know I am asking for a great deal of trust. But this is the only way. I would not suggest it otherwise.\"\nCountess Narina Carvain: \"Your champion has already explained the situation to me. I have agreed to it. We will not win this war through caution.\"\nMartin Septim: \"You have a rare gift, to know when desperation is the path of wisdom. I will do everything in my power to defend your city, my Lady.\"\nCountess Narina Carvain: \"If Bruma falls, the Empire falls with us. So be it.\"\nThe Great Gate.\nMartin Septim: \"Soldiers of Cyrodiil! The Empire will stand or fall by what we do here today! Will we let the daedra do to Bruma what they did to Kvatch? Will we let them burn our homes? We will let them kill our families? No! We make our stand here, today, for the whole of Cyrodiil! We must hold fast until the Hero of Kvatch can destroy their Great Gate. We must kill whatever comes out of that gate! Soldiers of Cyrodiil! Do you stand with me?\"\nChorrol Soldier: \"For Chorrol!\"\nCheydinhal Soldier: \"For Cheydinhal!\"\nAnvil Soldier: \"For Anvil!\"\nSkingrad Soldier: \"Skingrad!\"\nBruma Soldier: \"For Bruma!\"\nKvatch Soldier: \"Remember Kvatch!\"\nLeyawiin Soldier: \"Leyawiin!\"\nArrival in the Capital.\nBaurus: \"Sire, Chancellor Ocato is expecting you. He had word of your arrival in the capital.\"\nMartin Septim: \"Very well. Let's finish this.\"\nBattle of the Imperial City.\nOcato: \"Martin Septim, on behalf of the Elder Council, I accept your claim to the Imperial Throne. We should arrange the coronation ceremony as soon as ...\"\nImperial Legion Messenger: \"Chancellor Ocato! Chancellor Ocato!\"\nImperial Legion Messenger: \"Chancellor Ocato! The city is under attack! Oblivion Gates have opened, and daedra are inside the walls! The guard is overwhelmed!\"\nOcato: \"Courage, soldier. We have an Emperor again. Your Highness, what are your orders? Shall the Guard fall back to the Palace?\"\nMartin Septim: \"No. If we let ourselves get besieged in the Palace we're doomed. We must get to the Temple of the One immediately.\"\nOcato: \"As you command, sire. Guards! Form up and protect the Emperor! To the Temple of the One!\"\nImperial Legion Compound.\nImperial Legion Captain: \"The Palace is cut off, sire. We were the last to make it through from the Legion Compound. My men and I are at your disposal. What are your orders?\"\nMartin Septim: \"I need to get to the Temple of the One. It's our only chance to stop Mehrunes Dagon.\"\nImperial Legion Captain: \"Yes sir! Let's move out!\"\nOutro of Oblivion.\nUpon completion of 's main questline, Martin will say the following in its outro:\n\"The Amulet is shattered. Dagon is defeated.\"\n\"With the Dragon's blood, and the Amulet of Kings, we have sealed the Gates of Oblivion, forever.\"\n\"The last of the Septims passes now into history. I go gladly, for I know my sacrifice is not in vain.\"\n\"I take my place with my father, and my father's fathers. The Third Age has ended and a new age dawns.\"\n\"When the next Elder Scroll is written, you shall be its scribe.\"\n\"The shape of the future, the fate of the Empire, these things now belong to you.\""}

He wears full &lt;a href=\"Ebony%20Armor%20%28Blades%29\"&gt;Ebony Armor&lt;/a&gt;, excluding the helmet, and carries a unique sword. At the end of the final tournament match, both his unique helm and sword are awarded.\nBackground.\nIn &lt;a href=\"4E%20170\"&gt;4E 170&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"4E%20171\"&gt;4E 171&lt;/a&gt;, Martius Silius was a Legion Captain. He and his men were ambushed by &lt;a href=\"Goblin%20%28Blades%29\"&gt;goblins&lt;/a&gt; in the proximity of the town of &lt;a href=\"Blackridge\"&gt;Blackridge&lt;/a&gt;. Being injured, hungry, and thirsty, Martius requested aid from the town in order to get his men to recover. The previous harvest of Blackridge had been poor, and as a result, the town elder of Blackridge refused to provide the Legionnaires with the needed supplies. Martius asked once more, and was met with the same answer. In response, Martius slew the town elder, and ordered his men to &lt;a href=\"Blackridge%20Massacre\"&gt;kill the remaining civilian population&lt;/a&gt;. Martius later stated that he had to think of his men first, and that he would do the same thing in &lt;a href=\"4E%20180\"&gt;4E 180&lt;/a&gt; as he did back then.\nFor the incident, Martius and his men had to be judged by a military tribunal. A trial was held, with the judges being close to making a verdict when the Great War broke out, as a result of which the trial was ignored, and the verdict never came.\nDuring the War, Martius Silius continued to serve as a captain in the Legions. He and the men under him were seperated from their Legion, and found themselves deep in the territory controlled by the &lt;a href=\"Aldmeri%20Dominion\"&gt;Aldmeri Dominion&lt;/a&gt;. Due to being cut off from the rest of the Legion forces, Martius and his men raided military camps of the Dominion in the winter, as well as supply caravans for the Dominion forces. Weeks later, only being a dozen left in total, they managed to re-join the Legion forces just in time to participate in the &lt;a href=\"Battle%20of%20the%20Red%20Ring\"&gt;Battle of the Red Ring&lt;/a&gt;. While they were low in numbers, they helped retake the Imperial City, with Silius himself being decorated by &lt;a href=\"Titus%20Mede%20II\"&gt;Emperor Titus Mede II&lt;/a&gt; before being honorably discharged from the Legion.\nAfter his retirement from the Legion, Martius Silius became the Grand Champion, with the rest of his team consisting of &lt;a href=\"Metundus\"&gt;Metundus&lt;/a&gt;, Volusianus, and &lt;a href=\"Campanus%20Tetius\"&gt;Campanus Tetius&lt;/a&gt;. By &lt;a href=\"4E%20180\"&gt;4E 180&lt;/a&gt;, Martius had been Grand Champion for a total of eight times. He and his team would agree to participate in the grand Invitational Tournament organized by &lt;a href=\"Noura\"&gt;Noura&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"Town%20%28Blades%29\"&gt;Rivercrest&lt;/a&gt;.\nDuring the tournament, members of his team were slowly being killed off, the first being Volusianus, followed up by Metundus being assassinated in the infirmary after an arena match with &lt;a href=\"Dalan%20Silver-Skin\"&gt;Dalan Silver-Skin&lt;/a&gt;. The murderer would turn out to be &lt;a href=\"Boregis\"&gt;Boregis&lt;/a&gt;, the sole survivor of the incident at Blackridge, who had been killing the Legion veterans due to them having escaped their judgement from the military tribunal.\nRather than have the story of Blackridge spill out into the public, Martius and the &lt;a href=\"Fugitive%20%28Blades%29\"&gt;Fugitive&lt;/a&gt; agreed to settle the matter in the Imperial Arena. If Martius would win, the trial would be forgotten, and if the Fugitive won, justice would be served. Martius would eventually be slain by the Fugitive in the final battle of the Invitational Tournament.\nInteractions.\n&lt;a href=\"The%20Long%20Shadow%20of%20the%20Past\"&gt;The Long Shadow of the Past&lt;/a&gt;.\nConfront Martius with the claims of &lt;a href=\"Boregis\"&gt;Boregis&lt;/a&gt;.\n&lt;a href=\"Tournament%20-%20Championship%20Fight\"&gt;Tournament - Championship Fight&lt;/a&gt;.\nDefeat Martius Silius in the final arena match."}

He is commemorated every 9th of &lt;a href=\"Second%20Seed\"&gt;Second Seed&lt;/a&gt; on &lt;a href=\"Marukh%27s%20Day\"&gt;Marukh's Day&lt;/a&gt;, in which people remember his solemnity. Perhaps his most influential credo is seen in a famous quote of his \"All are guilty until they have proven themselves innocent,\" a concept still based heavily in the legal system of modern &lt;a href=\"Tamriel\"&gt;Tamriel&lt;/a&gt;. Despite being an Imga, Marukh did not look up to elves the way his fellow Imga did; in fact Marukh and his Alessian Order despised elves to an extremity. While Marukh did play an important part in organizing the modern &lt;a href=\"Imperial%20Pantheon\"&gt;Cyrodiilic Pantheon&lt;/a&gt;, he is often criticized for the severity of some of his principles. Marukh's teachings were sometimes referred to as the \"Monkey Truth.\" After Marukh's death a fanatical sect of the Alessian Order, known as the &lt;a href=\"Marukhati%20Selective\"&gt;Marukhati Selective&lt;/a&gt;, revived Marukh's teachings sometime in the Middle-First Era in response to perceived heresies of Aldmeri origin.\nBackground.\nMarukh was an Imga native to the then-jungled western &lt;a href=\"Colovia\"&gt;Colovia&lt;/a&gt;n coast, an area that is now known as the &lt;a href=\"Gold%20Coast\"&gt;Gold Coast&lt;/a&gt;. After looking at the stars that made &lt;a href=\"The%20Tower%20%28Constellation%29\"&gt;the Tower&lt;/a&gt; constellation in a state of near-death, Marukh was supposedly visited by the ghost of the Empress &lt;a href=\"Alessia\"&gt;Alessia&lt;/a&gt; who spoke to him and questioned the validity of &lt;a href=\"Mer\"&gt;Elven&lt;/a&gt; rule in Tamriel. Marukh recorded Alessia's words and out of them, formulated the Seventy-Seven Inflexible Doctrines on a scarp with his own blood. These doctrines would later be evolved into the &lt;a href=\"Alessian%20Doctrines\"&gt;Alessian Doctrines&lt;/a&gt;, a code of laws many saw to be cruel. After his conversation with Alessia, it became apparent to Marukh that death was an illusion, and that through \"Proper-Life and Ehlnofic Annulment,\" one can conquer death itself.\nMarukh's Seventy-Seven doctrines eventually gathered a following, thus the Alessian Order was born, which may have originally been known as the Brothers of Marukh. In order to gain more supporters the Alessian Order incorporated many polytheistic elements into their monotheistic religion, adding aspects of various cultures' gods into the Alessian canon as &lt;a href=\"saints\"&gt;saints&lt;/a&gt; and spirits. The Alessian Order quickly spread across Tamriel, and would eventually orchestrate a successful coup in &lt;a href=\"1E%20361\"&gt;1E 361&lt;/a&gt; in which they seized control of the &lt;a href=\"Alessian%20Empire\"&gt;Alessian Empire&lt;/a&gt; and established a theocracy as the ruling government in which they saw no difference between spiritual and political matters. Whether or not Marukh lived to see his religion flourish is not known; it is implied in \"&lt;a href=\"The%20Illusion%20of%20Death\"&gt;The Illusion of Death&lt;/a&gt;\" that he may have died while writing his doctrines."}

The Selective was formed during a widespread schism of the Alessian faith, their zealotry and power being great enough to be considered a significant internal threat to the Alessian Order. It is implied that the Arch-Prelate, Fervidius Tharn, secretly led both opposing ideologies during the schism.\nBeliefs.\nThe Marukhati Selective was heavily devoted to the teachings of the Monkey-Prophet Marukh, which is why the order bears his namesake. The original guidelines of the group were seven dictations each considered to be equal in importance and were thus all listed with the number \"1\"; they were referred to as \"&lt;a href=\"The%20Exclusionary%20Mandates\"&gt;The Exclusionary Mandates&lt;/a&gt;\".\nSome of the Marukhati Selectives' early doctrines and teachings were inspired by the &lt;a href=\"Psijic%20Order\"&gt;Psijic Order&lt;/a&gt;, though the Selectives would deny this.\nHistory.\nThe Middle Dawn.\nThe Marukhati Selective performed many rituals to prove that Auri-El and Akatosh were not one in the same to no avail. With this known, the goal of the Selectives changed to altering Akatosh to support their own beliefs. The secret master of the Marukhati Selective, &lt;a href=\"Fervidius%20Tharn\"&gt;Fervidius Tharn&lt;/a&gt;, channeled the &lt;a href=\"Aurbis\"&gt;Aurbis&lt;/a&gt; itself to remove the essence of the Elvish &lt;a href=\"Auriel\"&gt;Auriel&lt;/a&gt; from the Imperial &lt;a href=\"Akatosh\"&gt;Akatosh&lt;/a&gt;. Each Selective began initiating chants of proper-life to achieve a state of monothought until a staff/tower appeared in front of them that the secret master proceeded to dance upon until it withered, breaking into eight parts and spoke its protonymic. This action created the Dragon Break known as the &lt;a href=\"Dragon%20Break%23The%20Middle%20Dawn\"&gt;Middle Dawn&lt;/a&gt; which would last for 1008 years (&lt;a href=\"1E%201200\"&gt;1E 1200&lt;/a&gt;\u2013&lt;a href=\"1E%202208\"&gt;1E 2208&lt;/a&gt;), and with the Dragon Break ensuing, the Selectives utilized a technique called Right Reaching to manipulate the universe. The precise details of Right Reaching are unknown, but they involve the &lt;a href=\"Dragon%20Break%23The%20Hurling%20Disk\"&gt;Hurling Disk&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Mnemoli\"&gt;Mnemoli&lt;/a&gt;.\nDuring these years very few texts survive, though just about all of them conflict with each other when regarding people, and regions; some wars are mentioned that never happened in other sources, and the sun changed color according to certain accounts. It is even said that the gods may have walked among the mortals at this time. Whether or not the Marukhati selective had achieved their goal is not known as all records of the group were erased during the &lt;a href=\"War%20of%20Righteousness\"&gt;War of Righteousness&lt;/a&gt;.\nContemporary.\nCertain sources seem to imply that the Marukhati Selectives may still, secretly, exist, possibly making their home in &lt;a href=\"Port%20Telvannis\"&gt;Port Telvannis&lt;/a&gt;. It is known that at least one individual who refers to them self as a Selective still exists, and that this person, known as Xal, has shown interest in the metaphysical concepts behind the &lt;a href=\"Psijic%20Endeavor\"&gt;Psijic Endeavor&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Numidium\"&gt;Numidium&lt;/a&gt;. Whether or not these Selectives are truly what remains of the original order, or rather a newly reformed group taking on their name, is not known."}

All that remains is application to recently deceased tissue, and a few days of diligent observation. The rabbit I found should serve as a perfect test subject.\nWhile Marzula-jo feels great pride and excitement, he must proceed deliberately. This stage in the process presents tremendous risk.\n2E 342, Midyear 28\nThe reanimated rabbit exhibited unsettling behaviors\u2014attacking the bars of its enclosure and frothing at the mouth. It seems this one has more work to do.\n2E 342, Last Seed 8\nDark Moons! I must report with a heavy heart that Marzula-jo's dearest friend, &lt;a href=\"Sugarsnout\"&gt;Sugarsnout&lt;/a&gt;, expired last night. He was very young, as &lt;a href=\"senche-tiger\"&gt;senche-tiger&lt;/a&gt;s go\u2014only four years old. A wasting disease took hold of him just a few weeks ago, and despite my best efforts, his condition deteriorated rapidly. This one is heartbroken. I have nothing more to write on the subject.\n2E 342, Last Seed 11\nAfter long consideration, I have decided to test the most recent version my reanimation solution on Sugarsnout. I know I should conduct more trials on lesser beasts, but I would never forgive myself if I let this opportunity pass. &lt;a href=\"Magrus\"&gt;Magrus&lt;/a&gt;, look kindly on these works!\n2E 342, Hearthfire 2\nSuccess. Of a sort. My alchemical treatment reanimated Sugarsnout as expected, but he shows signs of aggression, and fails to recognize me when I call him. Mazula-jo is already regretting his decision, but the deed is done. At this point, all this one can do is hope for the best. In the meantime, I continue to perfect my alchemical recipe. Hopefully my next subject will fair better than dear Sugarsnout."}

He's arranged a meeting with a buyer after midnight, at an unknown location.\nHis greed angers the Goddess. Track the guard's movements, dispose of them both and return the artifact to her rightful hands.\nIn addition, the Goddess' temple is in need of new servants, both to restore this temple and to provide valuable services. Speak to Priest Drureth. He will hand you a letter to be delivered to the banished priestess, Aphia Velothi in Raven Rock. She is a friend to the Tribunal, and will translate it so that it can be passed to the common folk.\nWhen you meet her, be sure to also inquire about the whereabouts of our apothecary, &lt;a href=\"Curate%20Melita\"&gt;Curate Melita&lt;/a&gt;. She had been in search of the &lt;a href=\"Mask%20of%20Sotha%20Sil\"&gt;Mask of Sotha Sil&lt;/a&gt;.\nSucceed and you will gain access to the Goddess' armory. Fail and you will incur her wrath.

As a young girl, she was grossly disfigured by a spiteful servant. Avalea made a dark deal with Clavicus Vile and received the Masque in return. Though the Masque did not change her looks, suddenly she had the respect and admiration of everyone. A year and a day after her marriage to a well connected baron, Clavicus Vile reclaimed the Masque. Although pregnant with his child, Avalea was banished from the Baron's household. Twenty one years and one day later, Avalea's daughter claimed her vengeance by slaying the Baron.\nAcquisition.\nIt is a potential reward from the &lt;a href=\"Daedric%20Quests%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Daedric Quest&lt;/a&gt; \"&lt;a href=\"A%20Daedra%27s%20Best%20Friend\"&gt;A Daedra's Best Friend&lt;/a&gt;.\" The quest is completed by returning the &lt;a href=\"Rueful%20Axe\"&gt;Rueful Axe&lt;/a&gt; to the shrine of &lt;a href=\"Clavicus%20Vile\"&gt;Clavicus Vile&lt;/a&gt; and not killing &lt;a href=\"Barbas%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Barbas&lt;/a&gt;.

It is also one of the few headpieces that has a fortify Barter enchantment on it. It is, however, a &lt;a href=\"Heavy%20Armor%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;heavy armor&lt;/a&gt; piece that can be helpful for lower level players.\nTo receive the best possible prices, one should combine the Masque with an &lt;a href=\"Amulet%20of%20Dibella\"&gt;Amulet of Dibella&lt;/a&gt;, an &lt;a href=\"Amulet%20of%20Zenithar\"&gt;Amulet of Zenithar&lt;/a&gt; or a player-created necklace with the Fortify Barter enchantment, which is maximised to the possible highest amount."}

This can be very useful when fighting many tough foes. However, note that \"everyone\" is paralyzed, not just enemies. This can also include &lt;a href=\"Followers%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;followers&lt;/a&gt;, Thralls, and Atronachs, who will also be stunned for 15 seconds along with any land-based enemies present.

She has always been a long-time companion of &lt;a href=\"Ulthorn\"&gt;Ulthorn&lt;/a&gt;, a childhood friend, hunting companion and her romantic interest. One of her most prominent deeds was to save him from &lt;a href=\"Senche-Tiger%20%28Online%29\"&gt;senche-tigers&lt;/a&gt; in an area where they used to play when children.\nGwaering was also known as a very skilled archer. One of her most famous mythos depicts an archery training with Ulthorn and her sister &lt;a href=\"Lanwaen\"&gt;Lanwaen&lt;/a&gt;, was when Gwaering shot an arrow that split Ulthorn's in two, just like the next one. It is said that she never missed a shot.\nUnfortunately for Ulthorn, the courage, strength and skills of Gwearing led to her indication as The Green Lady by &lt;a href=\"Y%27ffre\"&gt;Y'ffre&lt;/a&gt; herself, when her aunt, Finoriell, died following her Silvenar's death.\nGwearing saw herself obligated to end her relationship with Ulthorn, since her natural mate would be The Silvenar, soon to be chosen as Indaenir. She finally cut all binds with him. Ulthorn, unhappy that destiny would not keep them together, then attempted to change this and made a pact with the &lt;a href=\"Daedric%20Prince\"&gt;Daedric Prince&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Hircine%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Hircine&lt;/a&gt;.\nHowever, unknown to her, that was not the last time she would see her former lover, as he would torment and threaten her, Indaenir's, and even the whole Bosmer races' life in order to obsessively change their destiny.\nInteractions.\n&lt;a href=\"The%20Drublog%20of%20Dra%27bul\"&gt;The Drublog of Dra'bul&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe Green Lady will ask the Vestige to meet up with her at &lt;a href=\"Dra%27bul\"&gt;Dra'bul&lt;/a&gt;.\n&lt;a href=\"Reap%20What%20is%20Sown\"&gt;Reap What is Sown&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe Vestige and the Green Lady investigate why the &lt;a href=\"Drublog%20Clan\"&gt;Drublog Clan&lt;/a&gt; invaded &lt;a href=\"Velyn%20Harbor\"&gt;Velyn Harbor&lt;/a&gt;.\n&lt;a href=\"Restore%20the%20Silvenar\"&gt;Restore the Silvenar&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe Green Lady has been enthralled by &lt;a href=\"The%20Hound\"&gt;The Hound&lt;/a&gt;.

The Silvenar himself will fall victim to it and transform into a werewolf. The Vestige and the Green Lady must put him down.\nConversations.\nRoku: \"Are you hurt, Elf?\"\nShaman Glazulg: \"Roku! Stay back!\"\nThe Hound: \"Though I am in Silvenar's city, I have power. Chieftain, cut them down!\"\nChieftain Agrakh: \"I warned you, Roku!

We belong together!\"\nAfter the first barrier:\nGwaering: \"Of course, Ulthorn! It's a beautiful first kill!\"\nUlthorn: \"Then you'll \u2026.\"\nGwaering: \"How could I not? But \u2026 the spinners have summoned me. I must go to Silvenar.\"\nAfter the second barrier:\nUlthorn: \"The Green Lady? But that's impossible!\"\nGwaering: \"If the spinners say I am, then I must be. We \u2026 we weren't meant to be.\"\nUlthorn: \"No! You must refuse. Gwaering, we will not be torn apart like this!\"\nGwaering: \"Ulthorn, please. My part in this story is \u2026 over.\"\nUlthorn: \"Then the story is wrong!\"\nAfter the third barrier:\nGwaering: \"\"You shouldn't have come, Ulthorn.\"\nUlthorn: \"\"They fear him, Gwaering! With Hircine's aid, we could \u00e2\u20ac\u00a6.\"\nGwaering: \"\"The Daedric Prince? I won't hear any more. If you think I'd turn against my people, you're mad.\"\nUlthorn: \"\"I don't care what it takes. Gwaering, I won't let this die. I'll do anything for you!\"\nGwaering: \"\"Anything? Then stop! My duty is to my people. I will protect them from any threat. Even you!\"\nUlthorn: \"\"Gwaering \u2026.\"\nGwaering: \"\"Take back the amulet, Ulthorn. Take it, and remember what we once were.\"\nUlthorn: \"\"This isn't over. This is not the end!\"\nIn the vision, while fighting off the feral Bosmer:\nThe Silvenar: \"Why? Why my love? Why is this happening?\"\nThe Green Lady: \"The Hunt \u2026 it's turned them. This never would have happened if the Dominion had stayed intact! Damn the eagle banner!\"\nThe Silvenar: \"I'm glad you two showed up. You can help us find \u2026 nng.\"\nwhile fending off the feral Bosmer:\nThe Silvenar: \"Nng! The pain! I can't go on much longer like this.\"\nThe Green Lady: \"What's wrong, my heart? Are you wounded?\"\nThe Silvenar: \"I don't know. I feel weak. I don't know what's happening.\"\nThe Green Lady: \"Hold on a little longer, my love \u00e2\u20ac\u00a6 damn it. Yet more coming. Help us!\"\nAfter fending off the feral Bosmer:\nThe Green Lady: \"We can't hold this place. Got to get out of here. Follow, if you would live.\"\nThe Silvenar: \"Leave me here, my love. Find safety.

Gyldenhul is an ancient burial tomb of &lt;a href=\"Haknir%20Death-Brand\"&gt;Haknir Death-Brand&lt;/a&gt;, an infamous pirate throughout the Sea of Ghosts.\nDescription.\nGeography.\nGyldenhul Barrow is situated on &lt;a href=\"Horker%20Island\"&gt;Horker Island&lt;/a&gt;, an insignificant island located along the Felsaad Coast of Solstheim. Most of the ruin is encased by &lt;a href=\"Stalhrim\"&gt;Stalhrim&lt;/a&gt;, a unique material found exclusively on the Solstheim Sea-Complex. The outside of the barrow is very visible, sporting the traditional Ancient Nordic Arches that tower over the entrance. The steel door is exposed, but it is impenetrable. The inner ruins have been swallowed into the ground, and it is buried in Stalhrim. Through the layers of Stalhrim is a long hallway leading to Haknir Death-Brand's tomb, where his immense wealth and powerful weapons are located. It is only a matter of time until Gyldenhul Barrow is completely buried and forgotten.\nHistory.\n&lt;a href=\"Timeline\"&gt;Early Years&lt;/a&gt;.\n&lt;a href=\"Haknir%20Death-Brand\"&gt;Haknir Death-Brand&lt;/a&gt; was perhaps one of the most notorious pirates throughout the &lt;a href=\"Sea%20of%20Ghosts\"&gt;Sea of Ghosts&lt;/a&gt;, being active for several thousand years, living much longer than most humans would live. In his lifetime, he was considered a legend by the pirates of Northern Tamriel, being referred as the King of Ghosts. He wore a full-set of Stalhrim Armor called &lt;a href=\"Deathbrand%20Armor\"&gt;Deathbrand Armor&lt;/a&gt; with twin &lt;a href=\"scimitar\"&gt;scimitar&lt;/a&gt;s made out of glass, both of which are called &lt;a href=\"Bloodscythe\"&gt;Bloodscythe&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Soulrender\"&gt;Soulrender&lt;/a&gt;. Upon near-death, Haknir declared that none of his crewmates would inherit his fortune and in the name of &lt;a href=\"Mehrunes%20Dagon\"&gt;Mehrunes Dagon&lt;/a&gt;, no one would ever earn Haknir's legacy until someone would best him in combat. Several thousand years later, Haknir would never be defeated, even after death. Haknir had sent his ship's quartermaster, &lt;a href=\"Garuk%20Windrime\"&gt;Garuk Windrime&lt;/a&gt; to bury the Deathbrand Armor throughout Solstheim. Haknir and his crew would be buried in Gyldenhul Barrow, remaining there until someone would defeat Haknir.\n&lt;a href=\"Third%20Era\"&gt;Third Era&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe Gyldenhul Barrow was discovered in &lt;a href=\"3E%20427\"&gt;3E 427&lt;/a&gt; by &lt;a href=\"Thormoor%20Gray-Wave\"&gt;Thormoor Gray-Wave&lt;/a&gt;, who caused his ship to crash land on the western coast of Solstheim, causing many of his crewmates and passengers to die amidst the wreckage. &lt;a href=\"Geilir%20the%20Mumbling\"&gt;Geilir the Mumbling&lt;/a&gt; was a seer who was riding Thormoor's ship at the time and he had survived the crash. In retaliation against Thormoor, Geilir placed a curse to the Sea Captain, giving him eternal wakefulness. With the help of an &lt;a href=\"Nerevarine\"&gt;estranged warrior&lt;/a&gt;, the curse was lifted from Thormoor and to show his appreciation to the traveler, he gave them the key to Gyldenhul Barrow, revealing to them a large bounty of gold, roughly around ten-thousand gold. Unbeknownst to the traveler, there was more to the ruins, encased by layers of Stalhrim. Sometime later, the key to Gyldenhul would be lost to time; the ruins would continue to be locked.\n&lt;a href=\"Fourth%20Era\"&gt;Fourth Era&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe key to Gyldenhul Barrow circulated throughout Solstheim, several pirates held the key until in &lt;a href=\"4E%20201\"&gt;4E 201&lt;/a&gt; when another &lt;a href=\"Last%20Dragonborn\"&gt;estranged warrior&lt;/a&gt; obtained the key. With the key and Garuk's map, they sought the location of all the pieces to the Deathbrand Armor throughout Solstheim, beginning with &lt;a href=\"Haknir%27s%20Shoal\"&gt;Haknir's Shoal&lt;/a&gt; in the Felsaad Coast. The traveler was able to bypass the Stalhrim barrier with an &lt;a href=\"Ancient%20Nordic%20Pickaxe\"&gt;Ancient Nordic Pickaxe&lt;/a&gt;, entering the Inner Gyldenhul Ruins. Deep in ruins, the estranged warrior was able to defeat Haknir's pirate crew, along with the ghost of both Garuk Windrime and &lt;a href=\"Thalin%20Ebonhand\"&gt;Thalin Ebonhand&lt;/a&gt;, and eventually Haknir Death-Brand's spirit. The traveler left Gyldenhul with Haknir's legacy and prized weaponry, leaving the ruins as simply Haknir's tomb."}

It is located on a peninsula on the far northwest coast. It was an ancient &lt;a href=\"Nords%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Nordic&lt;/a&gt; kingdom. The hold encompasses the area surrounding its capital city, &lt;a href=\"Solitude%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Solitude&lt;/a&gt;. The coat of arms is the wolf's head.\nDescription.\nHaafingar is the smallest Hold in area. Since the &lt;a href=\"Fourth%20Era\"&gt;Fourth Era&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"High%20King\"&gt;High King&lt;/a&gt; of Skyrim reigns from Solitude. The hold is separated from &lt;a href=\"Hjaalmarch\"&gt;Hjaalmarch&lt;/a&gt; by the &lt;a href=\"Karth%20River\"&gt;Karth River&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"The%20Reach\"&gt;The Reach&lt;/a&gt; by mountains. &lt;a href=\"Dragon%20Bridge%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Dragon Bridge&lt;/a&gt; is the only access to the hold by road, crossing the Karth River. Much of the hold is rocky and mountainous with soaring snowy mountains surrounding the north and west of Solitude, though the lower lying areas including Dragon Bridge are mostly comprised of forests and hills.\nSolitude is the jewel of &lt;a href=\"Empire\"&gt;Imperial&lt;/a&gt; Skyrim. Ruled by &lt;a href=\"Jarl\"&gt;Jarl&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Elisif%20the%20Fair\"&gt;Elisif the Fair&lt;/a&gt;, widow of the late High King, it is home to the headquarters of both the Legion and the &lt;a href=\"Thalmor%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Thalmor&lt;/a&gt;. Part of the reason for this is the eminently defensible nature of Solitude itself. Set upon a great stone arch that towers above the mouth of the Karth River, and surrounded by the soaring peaks of the Haafingar Mountains, Solitude is both a reinforced and breathtaking stronghold. Given the city's name, it is ironic that over 80 percent of the Hold's population lies within Solitude's walls, but this is testament to the city's political importance, formidable defenses and diverse population. The &lt;a href=\"Bards%20College\"&gt;Bards College&lt;/a&gt; is located here, as well as the sumptuous &lt;a href=\"Blue%20Palace%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Blue Palace&lt;/a&gt;, the residence of the Jarl. Both are constructed atop the huge, natural arch that the city rests on, affording spectacular views over the Sea of Ghosts and &lt;a href=\"Hjaalmarch\"&gt;Hjaalmarch&lt;/a&gt; to the east. Solitude's accessible docks and wharfs are in the relatively calm waters, making the trade one of the many reasons why the wealthiest of Nords hail from this capital city. Solitude is the one true cosmopolitan city of Skyrim."}

Several days after they moved in, noises began coming from the cellar, so he went to the nearest town to buy some traps for what he assumed to be &lt;a href=\"Skeever%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Skeever&lt;/a&gt;. Returning, he found Ramati's corpse and a &lt;a href=\"Chaurus%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Chaurus&lt;/a&gt;, which he killed.\nDesperate, he hoped to rescue his children, locking himself in the cellar so that the remaining Chaurus could not get past him to the surface again, but was captured by the &lt;a href=\"Falmer%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Falmer&lt;/a&gt;, who had built a den for themselves and their Chaurus in the abyss below the cellar. By this time Mani had been killed and Sudi had also been captured. His rescue attempt was a failure, and he contracted a fever through Chaurus poison.

All of the residents of this town are rude and distrustful of outsiders. They will menace visitors with vague threats.\nDescription.\nOutsiders are not welcome in Hackdirt. The citizens of Hackdirt become extremely agitated and hostile towards visitors who linger in the village for more than a few days.\nMost of the buildings, including homes, have a trap door on the ground floor or basement. The trap doors lead to a series of underground &lt;a href=\"Hackdirt%20Caverns\"&gt;tunnels&lt;/a&gt;.\nHistory.\nHackdirt was once a much larger settlement, sized between town and city. A long time ago, miners in the tunnels beneath the town discovered creatures, vaguely referred to as the &lt;a href=\"Deep%20Ones\"&gt;Deep Ones&lt;/a&gt;. The citizens of Hackdirt, awed by the Deep Ones and their powers, began worshipping them, rededicating their chapel from one of the &lt;a href=\"Nine%20Divines\"&gt;Nine Divines&lt;/a&gt; to the Deep Ones.\nIn time, the residents of Hackdirt became overtly hostile to anyone in or around the town and started to commit crimes. After several murders in and around the town, the &lt;a href=\"Emperor\"&gt;Emperor&lt;/a&gt; got tired of the constant fight to keep Hackdirt's citizens in line, and sent in the &lt;a href=\"Imperial%20Legion\"&gt;Imperial Legion&lt;/a&gt;, who subsequently burned the town to the ground and massacred most of its citizens. Some of the buildings of the town were later rebuilt by the few citizens who survived.\nThe inhabitants started to refer to anyone from outside the village as \"outsiders\" and acted very unfriendly to any visitors, but the town would never again rise to its former preeminence, and the Deep Ones disappeared.\nQuests.\n&lt;a href=\"A%20Shadow%20over%20Hackdirt\"&gt;A Shadow over Hackdirt&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Hero%20of%20Kvatch\"&gt;Hero&lt;/a&gt; is asked to go to the small hamlet of Hackdirt to discover what happened to &lt;a href=\"Dar-Ma\"&gt;Dar-Ma&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"Argonians%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;Argonian&lt;/a&gt; daughter of &lt;a href=\"Seed-Neeus\"&gt;Seed-Neeus&lt;/a&gt;, a &lt;a href=\"Chorrol%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;Chorrol&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Merchants%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;merchant&lt;/a&gt;.\n&lt;a href=\"Seeking%20Your%20Roots\"&gt;Seeking Your Roots&lt;/a&gt;.\nCollect a number of Nirnroots for &lt;a href=\"Sinderion\"&gt;Sinderion&lt;/a&gt; so he can make the &lt;a href=\"Elixir%20of%20Exploration\"&gt;Elixir of Exploration&lt;/a&gt;."}

A good girl.\nBut she too fell into evil of the cult. I had to take matters into hand again. So I did what was necessary, and I wept and wept into the night. Nothing before this had ever been so hard.\nThe third-born, &lt;a href=\"Valdia%20Lastblood\"&gt;Valdia&lt;/a&gt;. My little girl. My darling.

She was holding it, still pumping blood, in her hand and grinning maniacally.\nI never asked for this. I never wanted this. But I felt responsible. As if it was my fault. As if I had failed them all somehow.\nI did unspeakable things, but for the greater good. I never killed any innocents. But I killed my family. Perhaps this makes me more of a monster than they were, but I did what I thought was right. Sonya spoke of sacrificing the girls. Using them to gain ultimate power from Molag Bal. I couldn't let that happen to my little girls. I just couldn't!\nI hope they can forgive me one day.

If they choose to go with Hadvar when escaping Helgen, Hadvar's uncle &lt;a href=\"Alvor\"&gt;Alvor&lt;/a&gt; gives them some free materials.\nPersonality.\nHadvar thoroughly supports the &lt;a href=\"Third%20Empire\"&gt;Empire&lt;/a&gt; in regards to the civil war. He thus holds a strong resentment for the &lt;a href=\"Stormcloaks\"&gt;Stormcloaks&lt;/a&gt;, whom he sees as traitors, and often engages in combat with them.\nHadvar is shown to be a generally kind-hearted person, and shows sympathy for the &lt;a href=\"Last%20Dragonborn\"&gt;Dragonborn&lt;/a&gt; during the execution. He reflects on the war and killing of Stormcloaks if the Dragonborn sides with the Empire expressing that he is haunted by the memory of the men he killed in war. Hadvar is one of the many &lt;a href=\"Nords%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Nords&lt;/a&gt; in Skyrim who have voluntarily joined the Imperial Legion, which even further proclaims his loyalty and fealty towards the Empire. It is shown that Hadvar fights for what he believes is good for Skyrim, and firmly believes that it is part of the Empire. In addition, he has a very calm voice, and speaks in a respectful manner.\nInteractions.\n&lt;a href=\"Unbound\"&gt;Unbound&lt;/a&gt;.\nHadvar is first seen calling the names of the captives alongside the &lt;a href=\"Imperial%20Captain\"&gt;Imperial Captain&lt;/a&gt;, lining them up to be beheaded. Among those he calls include &lt;a href=\"Ulfric%20Stormcloak%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Ulfric&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Ralof\"&gt;Ralof&lt;/a&gt;, one of Ulfric's soldiers from &lt;a href=\"Riverwood%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Riverwood&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Lokir\"&gt;Lokir&lt;/a&gt;, a horse thief from &lt;a href=\"Rorikstead\"&gt;Rorikstead&lt;/a&gt;. In the confusion ensuing from &lt;a href=\"Alduin%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Alduin&lt;/a&gt;'s attack on Helgen, he spots the Dragonborn trying to find cover and tells them to follow him if they want to survive. If Hadvar is chosen instead of Ralof, after escaping Helgen he will take the Dragonborn to his uncle's house in Riverwood, where he will stay afterwards.\n&lt;a href=\"Joining%20the%20Legion\"&gt;Joining the Legion&lt;/a&gt;.\nIf Hadvar was followed when escaping Helgen, an option to let General Tullius know Hadvar is safe can be chosen. Though the General is glad to hear that Hadvar is alright, he can't simply let the Dragonborn join the Legion on Hadvar's vouch without verifying his survival, and thus redirects them to Legate Rikke for how to join instead.\n&lt;a href=\"The%20Jagged%20Crown%20%28Quest%29\"&gt;The Jagged Crown&lt;/a&gt;.\nIf the Dragonborn sides with the Imperial Legion, during this quest to retrieve the Jagged Crown from &lt;a href=\"Korvanjund\"&gt;Korvanjund&lt;/a&gt;, Hadvar will be with &lt;a href=\"Legate%20Rikke%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Legate Rikke&lt;/a&gt; and her troops that are about to enter the tomb to retrieve the crown before the Stormcloaks can for &lt;a href=\"Galmar%20Stone-Fist\"&gt;Galmar Stone-Fist&lt;/a&gt;, having been promoted as he now wears &lt;a href=\"Imperial%20Armor%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Imperial Heavy Armor&lt;/a&gt; in place of the &lt;a href=\"Studded%20Imperial%20Armor\"&gt;Studded Imperial Armor&lt;/a&gt; he was wearing back in Helgen. After the quest is done, Hadvar will be found back in Riverwood, this time staying at the &lt;a href=\"Sleeping%20Giant%20Inn\"&gt;Sleeping Giant Inn&lt;/a&gt;, still wearing his Imperial Heavy Armor he was seen in during the quest.\n&lt;a href=\"Battle%20for%20Whiterun%20%28Imperial%29\"&gt;Battle for Whiterun&lt;/a&gt;.\nHadvar will be among the Imperial Legionnaires and &lt;a href=\"Hold%20Guard\"&gt;Whiterun Hold Guards&lt;/a&gt; under Legate Rikke as they protect Whiterun from Stormcloak Soldiers and Generals until the Stormcloaks are routed and the city is saved from being taken. Hadvar will listen to &lt;a href=\"Balgruuf%20the%20Greater\"&gt;Jarl Balgruuf&lt;/a&gt;'s victory speech before heading back inside with Rikke, and the surviving Legionnaires and Hold Guards.\n&lt;a href=\"Compelling%20Tribute%20%28Imperials%29\"&gt;Compelling Tribute&lt;/a&gt;.\nIn the Imperial Civil War quest-line the Dragonborn will meet Hadvar, who was recently promoted, and two Imperial Soldiers who are scouting a Stormcloak caravan carrying a shipment of coin and weapons. The group was sent by Legate Rikke in order to cut off the supplies of the Stormcloaks.\n&lt;a href=\"Rescue%20from%20Fort%20Kastav\"&gt;Rescue from Fort Kastav&lt;/a&gt;.\nHadvar will be leading the Imperial Legionnaires sent to attack &lt;a href=\"Fort%20Kastav\"&gt;Fort Kastav&lt;/a&gt;, the main fort in &lt;a href=\"Winterhold%20%28Skyrim%20Hold%29\"&gt;Winterhold&lt;/a&gt;, which also is holding several Legionnaires inside its prison as Stormcloak prisoners-of-war (POWs). After the fort is cleared of rebel forces, Hadvar will remain behind with any surviving Legionnaires to secure the fort until a garrison arrives to place it under Imperial control, allowing the Legion to claim the hold.\nSound Quotes.\nUnique interpersonal dialogue.\nIf Hadvar and Ralof are near each other, they will engage in some dialogue. However, this dialogue is glitched, as it is random dialogue that occurs between two Stormcloak soldiers, followed by dialogue between two Imperial Soldiers.\nHadvar: \"How'd you end up here?\"\nRalof: \"My cousin disappeared one night. Some say the Thalmor grabbed him. It wasn't long before I found myself under Ulfric's banner.\"\nHadvar: \"So why did you join the Stormcloaks?\"\nRalof: \"I'm a true Nord. Simple as that.\"\nRalof: \"So why'd you join the Legion?\"\nHadvar: \"My father was a Legionnaire, and his before him. I guess I never considered doing anything else.\"\nIf the &lt;a href=\"Last%20Dragonborn\"&gt;Dragonborn&lt;/a&gt; followed Hadvar during the mission Unbound and did not start the Imperial Legion quests, he will have the same dialogue as other Imperials:\nCivil War.\nIf Hadvar survives Helgen and the Dragonborn later joins the Imperial Legion, then Hadvar can be encountered multiple times in the civil war questline. He first appears in the quest \"&lt;a href=\"The%20Jagged%20Crown%20%28Quest%29\"&gt;The Jagged Crown&lt;/a&gt;\", where he, along with &lt;a href=\"Legate%20Rikke%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Legate Rikke&lt;/a&gt; and other Legion soldiers, meet the &lt;a href=\"Last%20Dragonborn\"&gt;Dragonborn&lt;/a&gt; outside &lt;a href=\"Korvanjund\"&gt;Korvanjund&lt;/a&gt; where they then initiate an attack; eventually, they get past the &lt;a href=\"Stormcloaks\"&gt;Stormcloaks&lt;/a&gt; inside and retrieve the &lt;a href=\"The%20Jagged%20Crown%20%28Item%29\"&gt;The Jagged Crown&lt;/a&gt;.\nHe then appears again at the &lt;a href=\"Battle%20for%20Whiterun%20%28Imperial%29\"&gt;Battle for Whiterun&lt;/a&gt;, where he is among those who fight out the rebels and save &lt;a href=\"Whiterun%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Whiterun&lt;/a&gt;. After the battle, Hadvar is promoted to the rank of Captain. In the quest \"&lt;a href=\"Compelling%20Tribute%20%28Imperials%29\"&gt;Compelling Tribute&lt;/a&gt;,\" the Dragonborn must meet Hadvar, along with two other imperials, and they then must attack a small wagon of gold and weapons which is heavily guarded by Stormcloaks, after defeating the men Hadvar and the other two legionaries stay with the wagon while the Dragonborn reports back to &lt;a href=\"Legate%20Rikke%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Legate Rikke&lt;/a&gt;.\nLater, in &lt;a href=\"Rescue%20from%20Fort%20Kastav\"&gt;Rescue from Fort Kastav&lt;/a&gt;, Hadvar sends the Dragonborn into &lt;a href=\"Fort%20Kastav\"&gt;Fort Kastav&lt;/a&gt; through a drain leading into the prison, where they will need to rescue the imperial prisoners before coming out into the courtyard and attacking the &lt;a href=\"Stormcloaks\"&gt;Stormcloaks&lt;/a&gt; within. Afterwards, Hadvar sets up camp while the Dragonborn reports back to &lt;a href=\"General%20Tullius%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;General Tullius&lt;/a&gt;.\nAlthough Hadvar is not present at the &lt;a href=\"Battle%20for%20Windhelm\"&gt;Battle for Windhelm&lt;/a&gt;, he can be found back in &lt;a href=\"Riverwood%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Riverwood&lt;/a&gt; with the rest of his family."}

The room straight ahead holds several well-hidden rune traps and is otherwise a dead end. Up the stairs is a table with a swinging log trap directly in front, and more stairs up to the right (southwest).\nAt the top of those stairs is a wooden door, leading to a room with several witches and/or hags. To the left is a table with the skill book \"&lt;a href=\"Mystery%20of%20Talara%2C%20Book%20IV\"&gt;Mystery of Talara, Book IV&lt;/a&gt;\". Straight ahead is a throne with a hidden door behind it, which can be opened by activating the handle on the wall to the left of the throne (only visible once the appropriate quest has been started). A corpse for the quest \"&lt;a href=\"Locate%20the%20Assassin%20of%20Old\"&gt;Locate the Assassin of Old&lt;/a&gt;\" is behind that door.\nTo the right (northwest) is a drawbridge that can be dropped using the lever to its right. This leads up a few stairs to an open iron door to the left (southwest), which leads to another throne room with a &lt;a href=\"Frostbite%20Spider%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Frostbite Spider&lt;/a&gt; (that drops from the middle of the roof), and a key (\"Hag's End Key\") on a shelf, to the right of the fireplace. On a table against the west wall is the book \"&lt;a href=\"The%20Legend%20of%20Red%20Eagle%20%28Book%29\"&gt;The Legend of Red Eagle&lt;/a&gt;\".\nBack outside the room, a short set of stairs leads further up to the northwest. This leads to a master locked gate to the west, which can be opened with the key just obtained, and a series of three gates up stairs to the northeast, one after another. Through the locked gate is a crypt with a fire-trapped chest containing leveled loot. The northeast gates can be opened by activating a handle to the left, but caution is advised as spears come out from the walls as soon as the gates open.\nAt the top of the stairs is a room with a circular depression and candles all around. The room holds a hag, a witch, and a hagraven. See below for details on the battle with the hagraven. From this room, a master locked door to the northwest (which can be opened with the key), contains minor loot plus a leveled weapon. A master locked gate to the southwest, leads to a small room with nothing in it. To the southeast is a gate, which can be opened by pulling the chain that overhangs the depression.\nThrough that last gate is a path leading up to a large room with a word wall for the &lt;a href=\"Slow%20Time\"&gt;Slow Time&lt;/a&gt; shout (to the south southeast), and an &lt;a href=\"Arcane%20Enchanter%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Arcane Enchanter&lt;/a&gt; against the east wall. A door out to a parapet high above Deepwood Vale is on the southeast wall. This is where the hagraven makes her last stand.\u00a0On the platform with the altar (where &lt;a href=\"Bloodthorn\"&gt;Bloodthorn&lt;/a&gt; is found), is a chest with random loot, found by turning right when leaving the door.\nBattle with Hagraven.\nThe battle will take four rounds, with the hagraven retreating further into the redoubt after losing roughly a quarter health each encounter. In the last round, she will summon two leveled creatures to aid her \u2013 &lt;a href=\"Frost%20Troll%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;frost trolls&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Ice%20Wraith%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Ice Wraiths&lt;/a&gt; \u2013 plus Frostbite Spiders and Skeevers. Combinations of these creatures are also possible.\nThe last round can be made very easy if the shout &lt;a href=\"Unrelenting%20Force%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Unrelenting Force&lt;/a&gt; has been mastered. With patience and a high sneak skill, the hagraven can potentially be bypassed, avoiding the summoned creatures completely. Summoned creatures will not spawn while the Dragonborn is sneaking. However, if she sees them, she will summon her allies immediately. A well-timed Unrelenting Force shout will knock her off the platform and (due to her depleted health from the previous rounds) kill her. It can also be made very easy by using a &lt;a href=\"Paralysis%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;paralysis poison&lt;/a&gt; since she cannot summon her allies when paralyzed and can be killed before recovering. \nIt is possible to kill the hagraven in the third round if the Dragonborn gets an &lt;a href=\"Kill%20Camera\"&gt;animation kill&lt;/a&gt;. If this happens, the hagraven's corpse will warp out, the same way it does for the other two rounds upon exiting the room towards the word wall. The hagraven's corpse will appear at the place where the fourth round normally occurs, if it was not looted before leaving the room where the third round took place.\nWith very high &lt;a href=\"Sneak%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;sneak&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Destruction%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;destruction&lt;/a&gt;\u00a0skills, there is another way to kill the hagraven in the third round. While sneaking, a trap can be set in the area of her third appearance\u00a0by casting\u00a0&lt;a href=\"Magic%20Rune\"&gt;fire rune&lt;/a&gt;\u00a0on\u00a0the oil in the circular depression, then the\u00a0&lt;a href=\"Silent%20Roll\"&gt;Silent Roll&lt;/a&gt;\u00a0skill can be used to leave the area without attracting attention. The hag and the witch are likely to step in the rune as they search, igniting the oil. If the hagraven steps in the fire (not the rune \u2013 if she steps in the rune she simply disappears again) and the destruction skill was high enough, she will die instantly, instead of disappearing.\nIf the \"&lt;a href=\"Innocence%20Lost\"&gt;Innocence Lost&lt;/a&gt;\" quest has been completed and the Dragonborn sleeps after the first room and is kidnapped by &lt;a href=\"Astrid%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Astrid&lt;/a&gt;, (\"&lt;a href=\"With%20Friends%20Like%20These...\"&gt;With Friends Like These...&lt;/a&gt;\"), upon return to Hag's End, the hagraven will be back in the first room, apparently a lot weaker, and she can be killed right there.\nWith high sneak and &lt;a href=\"Archery%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;archery&lt;/a&gt; skills, it is possible to sneak up on her at each stage and hit her with an arrow, causing her to immediately disappear since she has received more than 1/4 damage. In the final confrontation, back out at the parapet above Deepwood Vale, she can be killed with one shot, thus never having a chance to summon any help.\nUpon returning to this dungeon after it was previously cleared, as long as enough time has passed, most of the dungeon contents and enemies will respawn. In particular, the final hagraven will respawn with only a quarter of her original health, in the final area overlooking Deepwood Vale.\nBypassing the dungeon.\nThe Slow Time word can be obtained without going through the dungeon. To the left of the proper entrance to Hag's End, there are some rocks next to the waterfall that are easily scaled. Once on top, it is easy to then scale and hug up against the rocks leading to the top, exit area of Hag's End. The door up there leads to the room containing the word of power, effectively allowing one to skip the entire dungeon; however, it will not be possible to go back through the dungeon in reverse."}

It is west northwest of &lt;a href=\"Purewater%20Run\"&gt;Purewater Run&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Dushnikh%20Yal\"&gt;Dushnikh Yal&lt;/a&gt;, and there is a path that crosses a bridge which leads up to it from Purewater Rock.\nOverview.\nA group of &lt;a href=\"Forsworn\"&gt;Forsworn&lt;/a&gt; have claimed this location as their home. This fortress has many levels from which the Forsworn can attack intruders with arrows and ranged magic.\nWalkthrough.\nThere are two ways into this camp along the road. One to the right leads to the base of an old tower which can be used to reach the very top. The other is to the left and leads directly to one of the entrances to Hag Rock Redoubt Ruins. There is a rock shelter here with an &lt;a href=\"Alchemy%20Lab%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;alchemy lab&lt;/a&gt;, leveled potions, and two &lt;a href=\"Containers%20%28Skyrim%29%23Apothecary%27s%20Satchel\"&gt;apothecary satchels&lt;/a&gt;, and an adept-locked chest with minor loot.\nUp the first set of stairs from the shelter is another set of tents and campfires. To the left (south) are an &lt;a href=\"Anvil%20%28Smithing%29\"&gt;anvil&lt;/a&gt;, two &lt;a href=\"Tanning%20Rack\"&gt;tanning racks&lt;/a&gt; and a &lt;a href=\"workbench\"&gt;workbench&lt;/a&gt;, along with several potions.\nThere are two more sets of stairs up to a broad landing. At this level, there are several more Forsworn, along with a &lt;a href=\"Forsworn%20Briarheart\"&gt;Forsworn Briarheart&lt;/a&gt;\u00a0and a leveled creature.\u00a0These are very difficult to defeat, even on the easiest difficulty, so great care is suggested. In the shelter to the right is a set of spiral steps leading down to an entrance to Hag Rock Redoubt Ruins (see below).\nBack on the landing, up one more flight of stairs is another tent with a chest with leveled loot, plus a dead\u00a0&lt;a href=\"Bosmer%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Wood Elf&lt;/a&gt;. A path up to the left (southeast) leads to another set of stairs. At the top of those stairs is the entrance to\u00a0&lt;a href=\"Dead%20Crone%20Rock\"&gt;Dead Crone Rock&lt;/a&gt;. The only way to Dead Crone Rock before discovery is through Hag Rock Redoubt, making the dungeon mandatory in order to get there for the first time.\nSublocations.\nHag Rock Redoubt Ruins.\nThis is a small dungeon that has three different entrances and contains three level based Forsworn and another Forsworn Briarheart. In one small section there are two, (apprentice), locked cells, one contains the dead body of a &lt;a href=\"Bandits%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;bandit&lt;/a&gt;. The key to the empty cell is on the cupboard to the right when entering the cell area. Another alchemy lab is in the room with the Briarheart along with a &lt;a href=\"Containers%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;chest&lt;/a&gt;. The hallway next to the room with the Briarheart has a trap rigged chest on a table, below the chest are two &lt;a href=\"Quicksilver%20Ore%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;quicksilver ores&lt;/a&gt; hidden under a &lt;a href=\"goat%20hide\"&gt;goat hide&lt;/a&gt;."}
