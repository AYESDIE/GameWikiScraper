Instead of using this to our advantage and bringing wealth and power to our people, we use it in the service of the &lt;a href=\"Thalmor%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Thalmor&lt;/a&gt;.

Either the &lt;a href=\"Sea%20Viper\"&gt;Sea Viper&lt;/a&gt;s will kill the stormwardens and I'll take control, or they'll show the stormwardens we cannot rely on the Altmer to protect us.\nOthers may see me as a traitor, but I commit my sins for the greater good of the &lt;a href=\"Bosmer%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Bosmeri&lt;/a&gt; people!"}

Prior to this agreement, there was frequent conflict between the two races: the &lt;a href=\"Daedra\"&gt;Daedra&lt;/a&gt; \u2013loving Chimer and the agnostic Dwemer.\nHistory.\nFormation.\nIn 1E 416, the First Council and the nation of &lt;a href=\"Resdayn\"&gt;Resdayn&lt;/a&gt; was formed by the Dwemer and the Chimer to handle the &lt;a href=\"Nord\"&gt;Nord&lt;/a&gt;ic invasions of &lt;a href=\"Morrowind\"&gt;Morrowind&lt;/a&gt; and to unite the two races as a single political entity, under the rule of Hortator &lt;a href=\"Indoril%20Nerevar\"&gt;Indoril Nerevar&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Dumac%20Dwarfking\"&gt;Dumac Dwarfking&lt;/a&gt;. After the formation, the Dwemer and the Chimer military forces battled against the advancing Nordic armies. The Dwemer and Chimer armies quickly destroyed the Nordic armies, and forced them out of Morrowind.\nWar of the First Council.\nAccounts of the events of this war varies, possibly due to a Dragon Break.\nAt an unknown time, Dwemer miners discovered a magical stone deep beneath &lt;a href=\"Red%20Mountain\"&gt;Red Mountain&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href=\"Kagrenac\"&gt;Kagrenac&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"High%20Priest\"&gt;High Priest&lt;/a&gt; and Chief &lt;a href=\"Tonal%20Architect\"&gt;Tonal Architect&lt;/a&gt; of the Dwemer, identified the magical stone as the &lt;a href=\"Heart%20of%20Lorkhan\"&gt;Heart of Lorkhan&lt;/a&gt;. Kagrenac and the Tonal Architects started to research and work on the Heart of Lorkhan. Kagrenac forged three tools, &lt;a href=\"Sunder\"&gt;Sunder&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Keening\"&gt;Keening&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Wraithguard\"&gt;Wraithguard&lt;/a&gt;, which he would use on the Heart of Lorkhan. The Dwemer were also trying building a new god, the &lt;a href=\"Numidium\"&gt;Numidium&lt;/a&gt;, using the power of the Heart of Lorkhan.\nThis was then discovered and Nerevar was informed of the threat. Nerevar was troubled and sought out &lt;a href=\"King%20Dumac\"&gt;King Dumac&lt;/a&gt; of the Dwemer to confirm the legitimacy of the threat, but Dumac was oblivious of that and quarelled with Nerevar. Following that, Nerevar sought out Azura and was told that the threat truly exists, and a war broke out between the Chimer and the Dwemer, fragmenting the First Council.\nSome accounts state that Nords and Orcs, along with House Dagoth, were on the side of the Dwemer while others do not mention the appearance of Nords and Orcs, and/or that House Dagoth was on the side of the Chimer.\nThe war eventually led to the &lt;a href=\"Battle%20of%20Red%20Mountain\"&gt;Battle of Red Mountain&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"1E%20700\"&gt;1E 700&lt;/a&gt;, where King Dumac of the Dwemer, Hortator Nerevar of the Chimer and &lt;a href=\"King%20Wulfharth\"&gt;King Wulfharth&lt;/a&gt; of the Nords were slain by different people according to different accounts."}

It is the first quest in the College of Winterhold's questline.\nBackground.\n\"I've found the College of Winterhold, where mages study the arcane arts in Skyrim. If I want to learn more about magic, I'll need to join their ranks.\"\nWalkthrough.\nWhen approaching the bridge to the College, the guardian of the bridge and the head of the &lt;a href=\"Destruction%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Destruction&lt;/a&gt; school at the College, the &lt;a href=\"Altmer%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;high elf&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Faralda%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Faralda&lt;/a&gt;, will ask the &lt;a href=\"Last%20Dragonborn\"&gt;Dragonborn&lt;/a&gt; to prove their ability to enter the College by casting a particular spell, selected randomly. The spell's level will depend on one's level and perks. If the Dragonborn does not know the spell, they can buy its &lt;a href=\"Spell%20Tomes%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;spell tome&lt;/a&gt; from her for cheap (30 ). They must, however, possess enough &lt;a href=\"Magicka\"&gt;Magicka&lt;/a&gt; to cast the spell that she asks them to demonstrate. The Dragonborn may try to circumvent this test by &lt;a href=\"Persuasion\"&gt;Persuasion&lt;/a&gt;; however, it requires a very difficult &lt;a href=\"Speech\"&gt;Speech&lt;/a&gt; check.\nAlternatively, the option to say they are the Dragonborn can be chosen, and instead of a spell, they will be asked to demonstrate the &lt;a href=\"Voice\"&gt;Voice&lt;/a&gt;. (This is only an option during the quest \"&lt;a href=\"Elder%20Knowledge\"&gt;Elder Knowledge&lt;/a&gt;.\")\nShe will then lead the Dragonborn to the College and give them a quest to speak with the College leader &lt;a href=\"Mirabelle%20Ervine\"&gt;Mirabelle Ervine&lt;/a&gt; (Master Wizard), a mage in the courtyard. This allows the Dragonborn access to the &lt;a href=\"College%20of%20Winterhold%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;College of Winterhold&lt;/a&gt;. She will give some &lt;a href=\"Novice%20Robes\"&gt;Novice Robes&lt;/a&gt; and a &lt;a href=\"Novice%20Hood\"&gt;Novice Hood&lt;/a&gt; to wear if one chooses so. These robes will have an enchantment to make certain spells cost less from one of the five schools of magic. The set is basically the same as the first robe and hood they came across when escaping from &lt;a href=\"Helgen%20Keep\"&gt;Helgen Keep&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe Dragonborn will then be taken on a short tour of the &lt;a href=\"Hall%20of%20Attainment\"&gt;Hall of Attainment&lt;/a&gt; and be told to see &lt;a href=\"Tolfdir%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Tolfdir&lt;/a&gt;, head of the &lt;a href=\"Alteration%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Alteration&lt;/a&gt; school, in the &lt;a href=\"Hall%20of%20the%20Elements\"&gt;Hall of the Elements&lt;/a&gt; where he is giving a lecture on Magic safety while the students want to skip over it. After a brief exchange with everyone, he decides to ask for the Dragonborn's help in a practical demonstration of ward spells. If one does not have a ward spell learned, he will teach them the &lt;a href=\"Lesser%20Ward%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Lesser Ward&lt;/a&gt; spell for free. Then they will be asked to defend themselves with a ward spell while he casts a long-range fire spell at them (either always a weakened version of firebolt, OR, it is possible the type and power of which is determined by one's level and one's ward spell's level). Once the Dragonborn has defended themselves successfully, Tolfdir will ask the class to travel to the nearby Nordic burial tomb of &lt;a href=\"Saarthal\"&gt;Saarthal&lt;/a&gt; to take part in an expedition. This finishes First Lessons, and if working to become &lt;a href=\"Thane%20of%20Winterhold\"&gt;Thane of Winterhold&lt;/a&gt;, this will count towards helping the people of Winterhold as well. The next quest, &lt;a href=\"Under%20Saarthal\"&gt;Under Saarthal&lt;/a&gt;, begins shortly thereafter."}

The colony of &lt;a href=\"Raven%20Rock%20%28Dragonborn%29\"&gt;Raven Rock&lt;/a&gt; belongs to the latter I'm afraid, and therefore we see no financial advantage in re-establishing any sort of business venture on Solstheim at this time.\n&lt;a href=\"Vittoria%20Vici\"&gt;Vittoria Vici&lt;/a&gt;\nEast Empire Company Warehouse, &lt;a href=\"Solitude%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Solitude&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Skyrim\"&gt;Skyrim&lt;/a&gt;"}

Mastermind of Nefarious Plots. All these things and more describe the legendary Baan Dar, he who is called the Bandit God. The Exile. The Pariah. But what is the truth?\nBaan Dar is a much more simple and complex being. I pen this tale as I slowly die of old age and a mortifying arrow wound. I cannot decide if the truth will add to or subtract from the legend that is Baan Dar, nor if the original Baan Dar would want the truth to be known. Therefore, I will leave this tale hidden when I am done and gone, and let Fate (which was ever Baan Dar's true master and motivator) decide.\nI was a child of twelve seasons when I first met Baan Dar. Orphan of a slaver raid during one of the many inter-provincial border wars. Living by my quick wits, nimble fingers, and the grace of Lady Luck in the back alleys and byways of my birth city. I had just \"liberated\" a loaf of bread and a few small apples from a local street vendor in the bazaar on the edge of the city, near the tumbled outer wall. I had withdrawn down an ill-lit alley to feast on my bounty when I was beset upon by an older band of my ilk. The older and lazier variety which were wont to engage in the easier and less dangerous art of stealing from the stealers.\nThere were five of the bullies who had decided they were more deserving of my bounty than I, and they were beating me half to death with staves, laughing the whole time. Lying on the ground, curled up into as tight a ball as I could manage, trying to protect my head and groin, I heard a quiet voice ask if they were not \"more suited to go down to the wharf and take food from your brother rats, or would you care to try your tricks on game a bit more your size and number?\"\nSince my \"companions\" had become otherwise engaged with the newcomer and had for the nonce ceased thumping, kicking, and cuffing at me, I looked up to see a dark shadow of boots, cloak, and chainmail hood leaning against the wall at the end of the alley.\nThe others, being what they were, took this as a challenge to their manhood\u2014and easy prey to their superior number with a promise of gold as added reward (else the first part would have been overlooked). The leader of my band of playmates suggested that the stranger take a leap off the aforementioned wharf unless he wished to join me there when they were done with their evening meal.\nHaving drawn chuckles and courage from his underlings, he then proceeded forward with staff at high port. I'm not quite sure exactly what followed, but within a short space of time, Lead bully was lying in the dirt with a thrown dagger in his chest, number two bully had lost three teeth to a boot (I still carry them in a leather pouch as a keepsake), and number three bully was brought short by his own staff applied forcefully up between his toes (the two big ones!). Bullies four and five thought better of the entertainment and departed rapidly for parts unknown.\nBaan Dar picked me up, dusted me off, and dragged me round to a nearby tavern, where we shared a meal and a mug. I attempted to thank him for saving my life. How can I ever repay this favor, I asked? His reply was short, to the point, and has driven my actions in life ever since.\nHe said, \"Never repay a favor, kid. Pass it on to someone else.\""}

A light strikes a rock, and the shadow is a record of their clash, past, present and future. Other conflicting forces produced less obvious shadows, fire and water, wind and rock, or nations at war. With skill and patience the shadows of all could be read, and patterns teased out, emphasized or eradicated. Manipulating a shadow could, through contagion, manipulate the object or force which cast it. Azra was eminent master of this nearly imperceptible magic."}

{"id": "876126", "revid": "17401442", "url": "https://elderscrolls.fandom.com/wiki?curid=876126", "title": "Firsthold", "text": "Firsthold or First Hold is one of the eight major cities located in the province of the &lt;a href=\"Summerset%20Isles\"&gt;Summerset Isles&lt;/a&gt;, being the capital of the region of &lt;a href=\"Auridon\"&gt;Auridon&lt;/a&gt;. As its name describes, Firsthold is the first settlement on the Summerset Isles and is perhaps the very first modern settlement on Tamriel, predating the cities of the human races and the beast races.\nDescription.\nGeography.\nFirsthold is located on the northernmost point of &lt;a href=\"Auridon\"&gt;Auridon&lt;/a&gt;, the second largest island of the &lt;a href=\"Summerset%20Isles\"&gt;Summerset Isles&lt;/a&gt; and the eastern bulwark of the province. Firsthold was founded by &lt;a href=\"High%20Lord%20Torinaan\"&gt;High Lord Torinaan&lt;/a&gt;, who originated from &lt;a href=\"Aldmeris\"&gt;Aldmeris&lt;/a&gt;, the ancestral home of the Elves. Torinaan landed on the northern coast in modern-day Vafe and eventually created Firsthold, on the highest cliffs overlooking the &lt;a href=\"Abecean%20Sea\"&gt;Abecean Sea&lt;/a&gt;. The cliffs of Firsthold are large, and the hidden coves underneath Firsthold are vast, seemingly endless. Firsthold is a heavily secured city-state with nigh impenetrable walls and water canals built around the &lt;a href=\"Diceto%20River\"&gt;Diceto River&lt;/a&gt;, which eventually falls into the Rilis Basin. Firsthold has beautiful parks, and gorgeous gardens with a wide variety of flora ranging from &lt;a href=\"Kanthleaf\"&gt;Kanthleaf&lt;/a&gt; and trimmed hedges. &lt;a href=\"Castle%20Firsthold\"&gt;Castle Firsthold&lt;/a&gt; is situated on the northern edge of Firsthold, separated by the Diceto River and large walls. The &lt;a href=\"Great%20Orrery\"&gt;Great Orrery&lt;/a&gt; is a structure built by &lt;a href=\"Vanus%20Galerion\"&gt;Vanus Galerion&lt;/a&gt; that looks into the cosmos and gives an interesting look of Tamriel. Because of how much of a thriving metropolis Firsthold represents, many settlements have inhabited the area including &lt;a href=\"Greenwater%20Cove\"&gt;Greenwater Cove&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"West%20Guard\"&gt;West Guard&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"North%20Beacon\"&gt;North Beacon&lt;/a&gt;.\nHistory.\n&lt;a href=\"Merethic%20Era\"&gt;Merethic Era&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe Lay of Firsthold &amp; Torinaan the Foresailor.\nDuring the Merethic Era, the &lt;a href=\"Aldmer\"&gt;Aldmer&lt;/a&gt; of the distant land of &lt;a href=\"Aldmeris\"&gt;Aldmeris&lt;/a&gt; had left their ancestral home for unknown and vague reasons. &lt;a href=\"High%20Lord%20Torinaan\"&gt;High Lord Torinaan&lt;/a&gt; was one of the first pioneers from the Elven homeland to venture into &lt;a href=\"Tamriel\"&gt;Tamriel&lt;/a&gt; and inhabit the continent. Aboard his ship, Torinaan landed on an alcove called the &lt;a href=\"Nine-Prow%20Landing\"&gt;Nine-Prow Landing&lt;/a&gt;, located north of the ruins of &lt;a href=\"Castle%20Rilis\"&gt;Castle Rilis&lt;/a&gt;. From there, Torinaan named himself the first Kinlord of Auridon and made an oath, never to leave his new home and to protect it at all costs. After this, he established a Kinhouse which became the famous Firsthold Castle that still exists in the city-state to this day. His home was then invaded by the long forgotten denizens of Auridon. The &lt;a href=\"Gheateus\"&gt;Gheateus&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Welwa\"&gt;Welwa&lt;/a&gt; had invaded his home, but his swift action defeated the monsters with the power of the stars and his &lt;a href=\"Varla%20Stone\"&gt;Varla Stone&lt;/a&gt;s. Torinaan and his people began a large exodus against the forest creatures of the Blessed Isles until they were smitten from the face of &lt;a href=\"Nirn\"&gt;Nirn&lt;/a&gt;. After Torinaan's accomplishments on Auridon, many other Elves from Aldmeris began to migrate into the Summerset Isles and spread out into the rest of the Summerset Isles. They establishing more Kinhouses and Kinlords from as far as &lt;a href=\"Sunhold\"&gt;Sunhold&lt;/a&gt; to &lt;a href=\"Lillandril\"&gt;Lillandril&lt;/a&gt;.\n&lt;a href=\"Second%20Era\"&gt;Second Era&lt;/a&gt;.\nVanus the Ambitious; Enter the Mages Guild.\nDuring the early years of the second era, &lt;a href=\"Vanus%20Galerion\"&gt;Vanus Galerion&lt;/a&gt; was a student of the well-known &lt;a href=\"Iachesis\"&gt;Iachesis&lt;/a&gt;, a member of the &lt;a href=\"Psijic%20Order\"&gt;Psijic Order&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"Artaeum\"&gt;Artaeum&lt;/a&gt;. Galerion had a passion for the arcane arts and wanted to share his knowledge to the denizens of Tamriel, so he sought out a way to spread this knowledge, and he began his pursuit out of the city of Firsthold. His actions were met with great opposition by the public when they realized that he would give the world, the ability to use fire, lightning, and concoctions to manipulate being's body. Galerion was forced to meet with Iachesis and &lt;a href=\"Rilis%20XII\"&gt;Rilis XII&lt;/a&gt;, the Kinlord of Firsthold to talk about the group he was created. What the Psijic Student said to the Kinlord and Master Psijic has tragically not been recorded but has been pondered by the modern scholars of the world. After that meeting, the &lt;a href=\"Mages%20Guild\"&gt;Mages Guild&lt;/a&gt; was formed and was forced to have guards. Because earning loyalty doesn't just require money, Galerion created the &lt;a href=\"Order%20of%20the%20Lamp\"&gt;Order of the Lamp&lt;/a&gt;, a knightly order operating throughout Tamriel like the &lt;a href=\"Phrygias\"&gt;County of Phrygias&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;a href=\"Iliac%20Bay\"&gt;Iliac Bay&lt;/a&gt;. The Guild brought many people together as friends like Rilis towards Iachesis and Galerion of the Psijic. As time went on, the Mages Guild spread throughout all corners of Tamriel, teaching the people the ways of &lt;a href=\"Magic\"&gt;Magic&lt;/a&gt; from the rich, to the poor.\nThe Queen and the Eagle; the Tale of Ayrenn.\nIn &lt;a href=\"2E%20563\"&gt;2E 563&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Ayrenn\"&gt;Ayrenn&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"Alinor\"&gt;Alinor&lt;/a&gt; was to be named the next Queen of the Summerset Isles after her father, &lt;a href=\"Hidellith\"&gt;Hidellith&lt;/a&gt;. Her family gathered at the &lt;a href=\"Crystal%20Tower%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Crystal Tower&lt;/a&gt; to celebrate her enrollment into the &lt;a href=\"Sapiarchs%27%20Labyrinth\"&gt;Sapiarchs' Labyrinth&lt;/a&gt; where she would study there for about three-thousand five-hundred and fifty-five days, and then become the next leader. However, Ayrenn had disappeared and left the province to get a glimpse of the life outside of her domain. &lt;a href=\"The%20Sapiarchs\"&gt;The Sapiarchs&lt;/a&gt; had noticed strange occurrences implying something important is bound to happen. One such event was that the &lt;a href=\"Great%20Orrery\"&gt;Great Orrery&lt;/a&gt; of Firsthold had spun around backward and a young eaglet sat atop the statue of &lt;a href=\"Topal%20the%20Pilot\"&gt;Topal the Pilot&lt;/a&gt;. Because of her disappearance, her younger brother, &lt;a href=\"Prince%20Naemon\"&gt;Prince Naemon&lt;/a&gt; was to inherit the throne in Ayrenn's absence and study at the Sapiarchs' Labyrinth. In her travels, Ayrenn drank with &lt;a href=\"Mabjaarn%20Flame-Hair\"&gt;Mabjaarn Flame-Hair&lt;/a&gt;, the High Queen of Skyrim from &lt;a href=\"Windhelm\"&gt;Windhelm&lt;/a&gt; and stole the &lt;a href=\"Indigo%20Scrolls\"&gt;Indigo Scrolls&lt;/a&gt; from the city of &lt;a href=\"Necrom\"&gt;Necrom&lt;/a&gt;. Years later, Ayrenn would assume the throne of Alinor and established the &lt;a href=\"First%20Aldmeri%20Dominion\"&gt;First Aldmeri Dominion&lt;/a&gt;.\nEstre's Gambit; Battle of Firsthold.\nDuring the &lt;a href=\"Alliance%20War\"&gt;Alliance War&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"2E%20582\"&gt;2E 582&lt;/a&gt;, the city of Firsthold was ruled by &lt;a href=\"High%20Kinlord%20Rilis%20XIII\"&gt;High Kinlord Rilis XIII&lt;/a&gt;, who was the leader of the &lt;a href=\"First%20Auridon%20Marines\"&gt;First Auridon Marines&lt;/a&gt; and was a staunch supporter of the First Aldmeri Dominion under Queen Ayrenn. At this time, a radical group known as the &lt;a href=\"Veiled%20Heritance\"&gt;Veiled Heritance&lt;/a&gt; began to rise throughout Auridon in response to the formation of the Dominion. The Heritance committed terrorist attacks throughout Auridon and the Blue Divide ranging from burning the township of &lt;a href=\"Silsailen\"&gt;Silsailen&lt;/a&gt; and conspiring with the &lt;a href=\"Ebonheart%20Pact\"&gt;Ebonheart Pact&lt;/a&gt;. When &lt;a href=\"High%20Kinlady%20Estre\"&gt;High Kinlady Estre&lt;/a&gt; was exposed as the leader of the Veiled Heritance, she had begun the next stage of her plan and unleashed a &lt;a href=\"Daedric\"&gt;Daedric&lt;/a&gt; army from the depths of the &lt;a href=\"Deadlands\"&gt;Deadlands&lt;/a&gt;, the Oblivion Plane of &lt;a href=\"Mehrunes%20Dagon\"&gt;Mehrunes Dagon&lt;/a&gt;. Through her magic, she was able to take control of the city of Firsthold, operating out of the Castle. The Aldmeri Dominion had to step in and seize control over Firsthold, but the process was dwindling. With the help of the &lt;a href=\"Vestige\"&gt;Vestige&lt;/a&gt;, the Dominion was able to withstand the Daedric Forces and reach the castle. Trying to contact Dagon, Estre chanted in the depths of the Deadlands while the attack was continuing. The Vestige entered deep into the Deadlands and encountered Estre in the center of the lava basin. In an epic battle, the two fought until Estre was ultimately defeated. Even though their leader perished, the Veiled Heritance continued to torment the Dominion, especially after the events in &lt;a href=\"Grahtwood\"&gt;Grahtwood&lt;/a&gt;.\n&lt;a href=\"Third%20Era\"&gt;Third Era&lt;/a&gt;.\nFirsthold during the Imperial Simulacrum.\nDuring the &lt;a href=\"Imperial%20Simulacrum\"&gt;Imperial Simulacrum&lt;/a&gt; from &lt;a href=\"3E%20389\"&gt;3E 389&lt;/a&gt; to &lt;a href=\"3E%20399\"&gt;3E 399&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Emperor\"&gt;Emperor&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Uriel%20Septim%20VII\"&gt;Uriel Septim VII&lt;/a&gt; was imprisoned along with &lt;a href=\"Talin%20Warhaft\"&gt;Talin Warhaft&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;a href=\"Deadlands\"&gt;Deadlands&lt;/a&gt; by &lt;a href=\"Jagar%20Tharn\"&gt;Jagar Tharn&lt;/a&gt;. Tharn planned for months to capture the throne, and he was able to achieve so in the span of ten years. Tharn had a powerful weapon called the &lt;a href=\"Staff%20of%20Chaos\"&gt;Staff of Chaos&lt;/a&gt;, and he split it into nine pieces and scattered them across Tamriel, the staff was the only thing keeping Uriel Septim and Warhaft in &lt;a href=\"Oblivion\"&gt;Oblivion&lt;/a&gt;. A warrior escaped his clutches and traveled all corners of Tamriel to retrieve the missing pieces. The hero was known as the &lt;a href=\"Eternal%20Champion\"&gt;Eternal Champion&lt;/a&gt;, and he assembled the staff and defeated Jagar Tharn at the &lt;a href=\"Imperial%20Palace\"&gt;Imperial Palace&lt;/a&gt;. The Eternal Champion had at one point visited the city of Firsthold in their quest to recover the pieces. The city of Firsthold was under the rule of &lt;a href=\"King%20Kalalian%20%28Firsthold%29\"&gt;King Kalalian&lt;/a&gt;.\nEnter Morgiah of Wayrest; the Firsthold Revolt.\nDuring the &lt;a href=\"Warp%20in%20the%20West\"&gt;Warp in the West&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"3E%20405\"&gt;3E 405&lt;/a&gt;, the city of Firsthold was under the leadership of &lt;a href=\"Reman%20Karoodil\"&gt;Reman Karoodil&lt;/a&gt;, who had lost his son around this time. When news of this reached &lt;a href=\"Wayrest\"&gt;Wayrest&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Lady%20Morgiah\"&gt;Lady Morgiah&lt;/a&gt;, the daughter of &lt;a href=\"Queen%20Barenziah\"&gt;Queen Barenziah&lt;/a&gt; met with &lt;a href=\"Mannimarco\"&gt;Mannimarco&lt;/a&gt;, the King of Worms to bring back his son from the dead, so that she can become the Queen of Firsthold. Later on in the year, Morgiah had married Reman Karoodil from the city of Firsthold, but this had brought about controversy throughout the two kingdoms of Wayrest and Firsthold. Many people would conspire against the holy matrimony to prevent foreign influence within Auridon and Firsthold. &lt;a href=\"Lady%20Gialene\"&gt;Lady Gialene&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"Skywatch\"&gt;Skywatch&lt;/a&gt; had sought a way to expel the Black Queen from Firsthold and had planned to do so with the help of the &lt;a href=\"Trebbite%20Monks\"&gt;Trebbite Monks&lt;/a&gt;, who have valued pure Altmeri bloodlines as their leaders.\nWhile King Karoodil was dealing with pirates off the coast of &lt;a href=\"Calluis%20Lar\"&gt;Calluis Lar&lt;/a&gt;, Gialene planned the &lt;a href=\"Firsthold%20Revolt\"&gt;Firsthold Revolt&lt;/a&gt; and had &lt;a href=\"Friar%20Lylim\"&gt;Friar Lylim&lt;/a&gt; orchestrate the attack in secret. The court of Firsthold gathered in the war room where Morgiah planned out the defense for Firsthold. Somehow, Morgiah knew Gialene was responsible and exclaimed that she would use Battlemages to attack the revolutionaries. Gialene had given the order to Lylim to use a reflection spell of &lt;a href=\"Mysticism\"&gt;Mysticism&lt;/a&gt; to counterattack the firebolts. However, upon breaching the Firsthold Gates, the opposition was met with the City Archers, who fired into the army, demolishing the group. Before King Karoodil returned, Morgiah executed Gialene's conspirators and exiled her back to Skywatch. Morgiah and Karoodil remained married and had two children, &lt;a href=\"Goranthir\"&gt;Goranthir&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Rinnala\"&gt;Rinnala&lt;/a&gt;. The two led Firsthold into the fourth era."}

The battle was in response to &lt;a href=\"Morgiah\"&gt;Morgiah&lt;/a&gt; assuming the throne of Firsthold as the Queen, the conflict is in made in the attempt to have her leave the Kingdom, considering the xenophobia the High Elves have against the mainland races. The attack was orchestrated by &lt;a href=\"Lady%20Gialene\"&gt;Lady Gialene&lt;/a&gt;, the Princess of &lt;a href=\"Skywatch\"&gt;Skywatch&lt;/a&gt; who was sent to Firsthold to become the next Queen of Firsthold. Morgiah had become the Queen of Firsthold by resurrecting King &lt;a href=\"Reman%20Karoodil\"&gt;Reman Karoodil&lt;/a&gt;'s son, so that the King of Firsthold can witness his son once more. Gialene had convened with &lt;a href=\"Friar%20Lylim\"&gt;Friar Lylim&lt;/a&gt; in secret, the leader of the &lt;a href=\"Trebbite%20Monks\"&gt;Trebbite Monks&lt;/a&gt;, to create a plan to force Morgiah out of the throne.\nKing Reman Karoodil was not present in Firsthold at the time; he had traveled to the &lt;a href=\"Abecean%20Sea\"&gt;Abecean Sea&lt;/a&gt; north of Firsthold where he had to deal with the pirates of &lt;a href=\"Calluis%20Lar\"&gt;Calluis Lar&lt;/a&gt;. The Firsthold Revolt had begun several days after King Karoodil had left the capital, the Trebbite Monks and the residents of &lt;a href=\"Auridon\"&gt;Auridon&lt;/a&gt; had rallied against the city-state of Firsthold. The revolutionaries were more significant in numbers than the Firsthold Royal Army, and so Morgiah gathered the Court of Firsthold to plan the defense against the Trebbite Monks. Lady Gialene and her servant, &lt;a href=\"Kael\"&gt;Kael&lt;/a&gt; were present at the meeting. Morgiah had told her court that she would utilize fire magic against the offense. Gialene would send the message to Friar Lylim that the Firsthold Guard would use fireballs in their attack, and so the Monks had used the powers of &lt;a href=\"Mysticism\"&gt;Mysticism&lt;/a&gt; to repel the attack. However, Morgiah had instead used an arrow storm in the attack, quickly defeating the Trebbite Monks and Friar Lylim. Firsthold had been saved due to the cunning Morgiah. In the end, Kael was executed for treason, and Lady Gialene was forced back to Skywatch. Morgiah continued to rule as the Queen of Firsthold."}

This opens a menu that shows a list of suitable fish. Any &lt;a href=\"Fish%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Fish&lt;/a&gt; native to &lt;a href=\"Skyrim\"&gt;Skyrim&lt;/a&gt; can be added to the hatchery, as well as clam. Once all species, which are listed below, have been inserted there is no need to ever interact with the hatchery unit on the platform again.\nTrying to add more than one of the same species of fish will result in the message \"You only need to add one of each item to the hatchery.\", and any surplus fish added to the hatchery will be returned to the inventory upon exiting the menu.\nSix fish of every species, except Slaughterfish, inserted will begin to spawn in the hatchery about every two days of in-game time. In addition to the fish themselves, raising any fish other than Salmon, Clam or Slaughterfish in the hatchery will also attract blue and orange dartwings, which can also be harvested. Inserting more different species simply yields more fish, restricting the biodiversity will not yield more fish of the desired species. Once added, a fish species cannot be removed from the hatchery.\nHarvesting.\nFish can be harvested manually by entering the water and activating the live fish, much like harvesting wild fish throughout &lt;a href=\"Skyrim\"&gt;Skyrim&lt;/a&gt;.\nIn order to get Salmon Roe from Salmon, the fish must be killed first. This can be done with &lt;a href=\"Unrelenting%20Force%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Unrelenting Force&lt;/a&gt;, a melee weapon or a bow. &lt;a href=\"Flames%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Flames&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"Frostbite%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Frostbite&lt;/a&gt; will not work. The dead Salmon will not I.D. when looked at but if activated they will yield both Salmon Meat and Salmon Roe.\nThe current will carry any dead fish to the right hand side of the Fishery. They will group together there for easy pickup.\nIf the spell &lt;a href=\"Ice%20Storm%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Ice Storm&lt;/a&gt; is used and aimed so that the field of effect is half in and half out of the water not only will the fish be killed but all of the \"Dartwings\" hovering above the water that get caught in the effect also die. The dead \"Dartwings\" do not float and can be found for easy harvesting directly below where they died.\nSlaughterfish Scales can only be harvested by killing the Slaughterfish first. If this is done, the Slaughterfish Eggs on the bottom will stop spawning until the Slaughterfish themselves respawn. Unlike the other fish which respawn in about two days, the Slaughterfish will take about as long as animals in the wild to respawn.\nShouting &lt;a href=\"Clear%20Skies\"&gt;Clear Skies&lt;/a&gt; will kill all fish within its range without making slaughterfish hostile.\nFish.\nThe following fish can be bred in the fish hatchery:\n&lt;a href=\"Creation%20Club\"&gt;Creation Club&lt;/a&gt;.\n The &lt;a href=\"Fishing%20%28Skyrim%20Creation%20Club%29\"&gt;Fishing&lt;/a&gt; content gives more fish options for the hatchery:\nIngredients.\nThe following ingredients begin to spawn in or around the hatchery after fish have been added:"}

Without a good spot soon, I don't thinks we'll survive the next winter, so I'm traveling further south towards Lake Ilinalta. Folks say it's cursed. Whole Imperial Fort just sank into the water one day, and they say the ruins have been haunted since.\nWhen I asked, I got ghost stories. Tales of people who went out near the lake and never came back. They say spirits haunt the hallways of the sunken fort and steal little children from their mothers' cribs. No amount of coin could convince any of the nearby villagers to guide me there, so I'm following the .\nDivines protect me.

Riches surely lie in wait, and we can hang our fishing rods up for good. I'll bet we'll find it here, amongst the rest of the scrap. We just need to keep doing what we know how to do best. Fishing.\nSometimes I see a glint, a faint glow at the bottom. But when I cast my line in or try to swim to the bottom to retrieve it, it eludes me.\n11th of Last Seed, 4E 201\nNo luck. We still haven't managed to fish up whatever it is that might power these machines. Jorid jokes we'll need a Dwarven fishing rod to solve this decidedly Dwarven mystery. Schematics are said to lie in a ruined tower at Alftand, in the mountains up north.\nWhen people speak of me tomorrow, they won't say, \"here comes Faldrin, the fisherman.\" They'll say, \"here comes Faldrin, the treasure hunter!\" We leave for Alftand at first light."}

Players only have to find the fishing holes and bait. When next to a fishing hole, activating it will start the fishing animation, which will end when the player has caught something. While fishing, the player cannot participate in other activities\u2014such as chat or inventory management\u2014without canceling the attempt.\nFishing holes.\n&lt;a href=\"Fishing%20Hole\"&gt;Fishing Hole&lt;/a&gt;s\u00a0can be found in most water sources across Tamriel. They appear as a small area of rippling water with fish jumping around in it. A fishing hole will only provide a small number of fish or other items before it drys up and disappears. Currently, it is unknown how many fish a fishing hole can hold, whether all fishing holes hold similar amounts, whether fishing holes respawn in the same locations, or how long it takes for a fishing hole to respawn. While the player can use any bait at a fishing hole, the chances for catching a fish, or rare fish for the achievement, are increased significantly by using the appropriate bait for the water type.\nWater types.\nThere are currently four types of water in Tamriel: Lake, River, Ocean, and Foul Water. Each type has its own type of fish, its own rare fish, and requires certain baits to be most effective.\nBait.\nBaits are items required to fish. They can be acquired by looting containers, harvesting &lt;a href=\"Resource%20Node\"&gt;Resource Node&lt;/a&gt;s, killing various &lt;a href=\"Creatures%20%28Online%29\"&gt;creatures&lt;/a&gt;, and fishing.\nRewards.\nEach fishing attempt can yield any of the following:\nRare fish.\nEach region of Tamriel has twelve rare fish. Catching all the rare fish in a region will reward an achievement, and doing so in every region of Tamriel will reward another, as well as the title, \"&lt;a href=\"Master%20Angler\"&gt;Master Angler&lt;/a&gt;.\" Each water type in the zone will have three rare fish associated with it. For instance, you will find &lt;a href=\"Muskie\"&gt;Muskie&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Blackspotted%20Pike\"&gt;Blackspotted Pike&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Shimmerpike\"&gt;Shimmerpike&lt;/a&gt; by fishing in rivers in &lt;a href=\"Auridon\"&gt;Auridon&lt;/a&gt;, but not oceans or lakes. It has been stated that multiple people fishing at the same hole will increase the chances of finding a rare fish; however, it will also cause the fishing hole to dry up faster. In a previous version, there was a bug where a player was unable to loot the rare fish, but this has now been patched.\nUses for fish.\nFish were originally included immediately upon retrieval as provisioning and alchemy ingredients; however, that use was removed early in the Beta. Currently, they are listed as trophies, and provide a small amount of gold when sold to vendors. They can still be used to create a provisioning ingredient\u2014\"&lt;a href=\"Fish%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Fish&lt;/a&gt;\"\u2014by selecting the \"Use\" option in the inventory, but this is no longer automatic. Doing this also gives a chance to find &lt;a href=\"Perfect%20Roe\"&gt;Perfect Roe&lt;/a&gt;.\n\"Common\" fish sell for 3 each."}

In the original game, fishing equipment is available, though cannot be used, meaning fish can only be caught bare-handed. This usually involves wading or swimming into a body of water, but fish can also sometimes be caught from the shoreline. Alternatively, &lt;a href=\"Unrelenting%20Force%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Unrelenting Force&lt;/a&gt; can be used to launch the fish out of the water.\nFish.\nThe following fish can be caught around &lt;a href=\"Skyrim\"&gt;Skyrim&lt;/a&gt;, and can be used as &lt;a href=\"Ingredients%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;alchemical ingredients&lt;/a&gt;:\n&lt;a href=\"Slaughterfish%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Slaughterfish&lt;/a&gt; also inhabit many waterways, but unlike other species of fish, they must be killed before they can be harvested. They provide &lt;a href=\"slaughterfish%20scales\"&gt;slaughterfish scales&lt;/a&gt;, another Alchemy ingredient. &lt;a href=\"Slaughterfish%20egg\"&gt;Slaughterfish egg&lt;/a&gt;s can also be found in and around many bodies of water, and can also be used in Alchemy.\nLocations.\n&lt;a href=\"Salmon\"&gt;Salmon&lt;/a&gt; can be found in streams, and around turbulent bodies of water (such as the waterfalls around &lt;a href=\"Whiterun%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Whiterun&lt;/a&gt;). The moat encircling &lt;a href=\"Dragonsreach\"&gt;Dragonsreach&lt;/a&gt; holds &lt;a href=\"salmon\"&gt;salmon&lt;/a&gt;, as well.\nA good way to spot the location of fish without diving is to sit on the shoreline and watch for &lt;a href=\"orange%20dartwing\"&gt;orange dartwing&lt;/a&gt;s and &lt;a href=\"blue%20dartwing\"&gt;blue dartwing&lt;/a&gt;s hovering over the water. The locations they hover over are where fish are present under the surface.\nAn excellent spot to find a mixture of all the fish listed here is outside of &lt;a href=\"Riften%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Riften&lt;/a&gt;. From the front entrance, outside, follow the walls around past the stables and keep circling until you hit the lake. The commonality of the fish seems to change over time, but if you are specifically seeking out only salmon, you are better off looking in the docks in front of &lt;a href=\"Solitude%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Solitude&lt;/a&gt;. You can also kill salmon by shooting them with your bow.\nUsing the Unrelenting Force shout on fish in the water kills them, causing them to float to the surface making them easier to catch. Another way of catching fish is to shoot them with a bow. This is a lot harder than shouting or grabbing them from the water but a lot more fun. The perks eagle eye and steady hand make this a lot easier.\nBreeding fish.\nIn , a &lt;a href=\"fish%20hatchery\"&gt;fish hatchery&lt;/a&gt; can be built on the grounds of &lt;a href=\"Windstad%20Manor\"&gt;Windstad Manor&lt;/a&gt; if the property is purchased.

Good for you! It's a noble endeavor, and with plenty of practice, it can be profitable one. \nKeep in mind that every journey begins with a single step, one that is usually clumsy and will end with you falling on your face. That is why, for your first lesson, it's recommended that you stick to calmer skies and fairer climates, where the fish will happily bite on even the most unattractive of hooks.\nThis guidebook details four types of fish that are ideal for beginners. They are most common on a clear day near streams and lakes in the fairer parts of Skyrim away from snow and ice.\nThe places one can catch these fish are too numerous to mention here, but an excellent way to begin one's fishing journey is to start by casting your line right off the docks near the Riften Fishery into Lake Honrich.\nOnce you've had your fill of lake fish, head west to try your hand at fishing from the river that runs alongside Ivarstead. End your journey at Vilemyr Inn with aching arms and a full belly.\n&lt;poem&gt;\nCarp\nCaught in Temperate Lakes and Streams\nLarge in Size\nUncommonly Caught\nSeen in Fair Weather\n&lt;/poem&gt;\nThey say the carp is the Jarl of the Karth River. Royal, stately, and austere. This sounds like it would taste very tough and chewy, but that is not the case! Eat until your scales swell!\nCarp are very popular for many reasons. Some even keep them as pets. But they are too big for most fish tanks. Better to eat them.\n&lt;poem&gt;\nGlassfish\nCaught in Temperate Lakes\nSmall in Size\nCommonly Caught\nSeen in Fair Weather\n&lt;/poem&gt;\nGlassfish are a common fish one can see through like a window! They are not so different than us on the inside. The best time to catch them is on a clear day, but if you are lucky, you can catch them on a rainy day as well.\nWhile their natural habitats are deep subterranian waterways, glassfish can be caught in the open waters of warm, clear lakes when they swim above ground for spawning.\nThey say that if you eat a glassfish, you'll become clear as glass yourself.\n&lt;poem&gt;\nGoldfish\nCaught in Temperate Lakes\nSmall in Size\nUncommonly Caught\nSeen in Fair Weather\n&lt;/poem&gt;\nGoldfish are known for being kind. They would much rather talk things out than get into a fight. This doesn't mean they will be friends with your hook. You will need to woo them, like any fish.\nLike glassfish, you won't find them in a river. The next time you think you've spotted a septim glistening at the bottom of a small pond, there's a chance it might be a friendly goldfish staring back instead.\n&lt;poem&gt;\nPogfish\nCaught in Temperate Streams\nLarge in Size\nCommonly Caught\nSeen in Fair and Rainy Weather\n&lt;/poem&gt;\nA long, bright fish with silver scales and a claw-shaped mouth. I should ask Viriya what she thinks of pogfish. Perhaps she might like them just as much as mudcrab.\nYou can also find a pogfish on a rainy day. Sometimes they are just in a gloomy mood.\nPogfish use their powerful fins to swim up and down the rivers of Skyrim, most commonly in the Reach. Spend some time fishing along a stream and your lure will catch the clawed face of a pogfish before you know it.\nIf you manage to obtain all these fish, congratulations! You have graduated from novice to apprentice. If you are so inclined, feel free to bring proof of your catches to the Fishery in Riften. We are always looking for new friends to add to our collection!"}

Well, some fish come when it shines, others when it rains. For our next lesson, we will focus on the latter. \nThe fish in this guide come to the surface more often in the rain in the temperate parts of Skyrim. Some say they like the rain, or that they are gloomy fish who hate the sun.\nIn truth, they enjoy watching the ripples dance along the surface above them and want to join in on the festivities. Even fish want to enjoy themselves from time to time.\nFor advice on where to fish, refer to the first volume of this illustrious series of guides. The places are the same, the only difference is... rain! For a change of pace, try fishing along the White River east of Whiterun, and follow it south to Lake Ilinalta.\n&lt;poem&gt;\nCatfish\nCaught in Temperate Lakes\nLarge in Size\nCommonly Caught\nSeen in Rainy Weather\n&lt;/poem&gt;\nCatfish are very large, nosy fish, and it will know them by their whiskers. They can be found in any warm lake in Skyrim large enough to swim freely in.\nKeep in mind catfish do not meow like cats, nor will they pick your pocket, so feel free to let your coin purse dangle.\n&lt;poem&gt;\nPearlfish\nCaught in Temperate Lakes and Streams\nSmall in Size\nUncommonly Caught\nSeen in Rainy Weather\n&lt;/poem&gt;\nThe pearlfish comes next on the list. They are less common than catfish, and smaller too, but they are adorable little fish all the same.\nAs a side note, a pearlfish has no pearls. Their name comes from the way they gather near clams along the northern shore. Strange, then, that it is not called a clamfish.\n&lt;poem&gt;\nPygmy Sunfish\nCaught in Temperate Lakes\nSmall in Size\nCommonly Caught\nSeen in Rainy Weather\n&lt;/poem&gt;\nA small lake fish named after the sun but seen most often in the rain. I am not saying the fish is a liar, but if you ever meet the person who named it, they are not to be trusted. They can also be found on a sunny day, but it is as rare as the sun in a storm.\nPygmy sunfish are often seen by travelers who stop to enjoy the hot springs of Eastmarch. If you aren't paying attention while you relax, you may be in for a surprise!\n&lt;poem&gt;\nSpadefish\nCaught in Temperate Streams\nSmall in Size\nUncommonly Caught\nSeen in Rainy Weather\n&lt;/poem&gt;\nThe spadefish is shaped like a disc, with brush-like teeth. Maybe it will give your hook a good cleaning while it bites.\nIt's best to stick to rivers to catch them. I've heard rumors that they love to splash about beneath waterfalls in the Reach.\nThat concludes our guide to fishing in the rain. Keep in mind that these are but four of many species you can catch on a rainy day, so be sure to keep at it until you reel in what you desire.\nIf you feel your skill is lacking, do not lose confidence! Fish can tell when you have cast a nervous line. They will tell their entire school what a bad fisher you are and how your bait shakes like a bone trap. Do not give them the satisfaction.\nOnce you have managed to catch the fish in this guide, you have risen to the rank of adept!"}

Just say the word to an outlander and a shiver will run up their spine before biting them in the neck. But for an aspiring fisher, this miserable frozen snowscape is more bark than bite, and an opportunity to discover new, deep water fish.\nIn this guidebook you will find tips for catching fish in arctic, snow-fringed waters. The most important tip being to keep yourself warm, your cast true, and your line steady. Let the shivers crawl up the fish instead.\nAny place with freezing water will do, but if you're looking for a few places to get started, try fishing the Yorgrim River off the docks of Windhelm. Fishing from the sea near the ships in Dawnstar should also lead to a few bites. Finally, Nightgate Inn has a small lake that visitors have been known to enjoy casting their lines into during their stays.\n&lt;poem&gt;\nAngler Larvae\nCaught in Freezing Waters\nSmall in Size\nCommonly Caught\nSeen in Any Weather\n&lt;/poem&gt;\nTo catch an angler is a feat best reserved for master fishermen, but their hatchlings are a different story. Angler larvae thrive along the sea floor, but often come to the surface and become enticed by the gleam of a fisherman's shiny hook. \nSize does not matter here. The Fishery will not judge you for trying to catch a baby fish. The fully grown angler will be yours in due time.\n&lt;poem&gt;\nArctic Char\nCaught in Freezing Waters\nLarge in Size\nUncommonly Caught\nSeen in Any Weather\n&lt;/poem&gt;\nThe char is a cold-water, spotted fish, native to the coastal shores of Skyrim. It is less common than the grayling, so patience must be had when fishing for it. When I need to be patient, I like to count fish in my head, but you must come up with your own method. If you copy mine, you must pay royalties.\nSome have taken to calling it \"Captain's Bane\" as they are known to gather near shipwrecks. For that reason, having an arctic char swim alongside your vessel is an ill omen indeed.\n&lt;poem&gt;\nArctic Grayling\nCaught in Freezing Waters\nLarge in Size\nCommonly Caught\nSeen in Any Weather\n&lt;/poem&gt;\nA long, tapered fish that is a cousin of the salmon. Ours is to wonder if they have family gatherings, but this is unlikely, given how the grayling prefers the cold.\nSome say the grayling is the \"Lady of the Ice.\" True to its name, it is an elegant fish, and dances in the water beneath the ice floes in the Sea of Ghosts. I have seen it.\n&lt;poem&gt;\nCod\nCaught in Freezing Waters\nLarge in Size\nUncommonly Caught\nSeen in Any Weather\n&lt;/poem&gt;\nThe cod is at home in any frozen river, such as the coldest parts of the White River as it winds its way past Windhelm.\nThe cod is a remarkable fish, which you can identify by its three dorsal fins. They say all the best things come in threes. A good play has three acts. A sandwich has three parts. The Dunmer worship three gods. Triangles.\nSpeaking of threes, this concludes the third volume on our guide to fishing mastery. Once you have caught all of the fish in this book, you have risen to the enviable rank of expert. Well done!"}

It is likely not the void of death that is standing before you, but rather, one of Skyrim's many caverns, mines, and other dark places. It is a darkness that, if you're lucky, will be full of water and teeming with fish.\nBut be forewarned, while you may be a seasoned adventurer, only an expert fisherman should attempt to fish these uncharted waters. While they won't kill you, if you fail to catch one you may just die of embarrasment, and that is a fate far worse. Fortunately, this guidebook will help you avoid having to hear the mocking laughter of fish echoing in your skull.\nBefore we get to the fish, we should first discuss the places one can go that are suitable for fishing in the dark.\nBrood Cavern, in the mountains south of Morthal, is well known by hunters as a place of shelter and hungry fish eager to bite your hook. You may have to contend with wild animals that sometimes reside in its cool depths, so pack something sharp to go along with your fishing rod.\nEmbershard Mine near the sleepy town of Riverwood is said to be flooded deep within, and may be a hidden gem for subterranean fish seekers. It is too bad that bandits and thugs have been seen by many coming and going from its entrance. It may be best to fish elsewhere for now.\nFor the truly brave, Chillwind Depths south of the Dragon Bridge is rumored to have dark waters that ripple with life. Take care not to venture far from the entrance, as this cave is known to be infested with frostbite spiders.\nThese are only a few of the many deep places one may find a good fishing spot. Those that fancy themselves as explorers will no doubt turn up numerous places to cast their lines underground.\n&lt;poem&gt;\nDirefish\nCaught Underground\nLarge in Size\nCommonly Caught\n&lt;/poem&gt;\nLegend has it that the direfish has a bit of dragon blood coursing through its fish veins. It would be a dire situation indeed if you pulled your rod up and a dragon was on the other side.\nDirefish have been known to enjoy giving underground explorers a fright by splashing the waters of the underground lakes they inhabit when anyone passes by.\n&lt;poem&gt;\nGlass Catfish\nCaught Underground\nLarge in Size\nCommonly Caught\n&lt;/poem&gt;\nThe glass catfish is also known as the ghost catfish, or the phantom catfish. Those names might be too frightening for timid fisherman, so we call it the glass catfish to help soothe your nerves.\nTo me, cutting my scales on glass is a scarier thought than a ghostly catfish. Perhaps I am alone in thinking this way.\nLike the glassfish, the glass catfish is native to deep subterranean waters where the sun is a distant memory.\n&lt;poem&gt;\nTripod Spiderfish\nCaught Underground\nLarge in Size\nUncommonly Caught\n&lt;/poem&gt;\nI will let you in on a secret. I have a fear, one that is quite common in Skyrim. I am terrified of... things with three legs. Why use three, instead of four? It seems like an accident waiting to happen. What, you thought I was terrified of spiders? They are good for pest control. \nI know I said good things come in threes, but the tripod spiderfish is an exception. It is a long, terrifying creature, found stalking the bottom of underground lakes. It does not use its eyes to find food, but rather it perches on its fins and senses the movement of its prey. \n&lt;poem&gt;\nVampire Fish\nCaught Underground\nLarge in Size\nUncommonly Caught\n&lt;/poem&gt;\nCaves are dark, and creatures of the night are drawn to their shadowy splendor. The vampire fish is much like its namesake, swimming in dark pools, baring sharp fangs. Ours is to wonder if they also have tiny coffins to sleep in. If you manage to catch such a fish, let me know.\nWe have completed our dark and treacherous journey into the world of underground fish. If you have the determination to catch all of the fish within these pages, you are a true fishing master. Fine work!"}

You have dipped your rods in half-frozen lakes, and in waters tucked away in bottomless caves. You have fished the breadth of Skyrim, from Winterhold to Falkreath, and become an expert of the craft. However, you still have more to learn.\nThe rarest fish cannot be lured with technique alone. One must center themselves, and be in tune with the water mentally and spiritually. You also need more specialized rods, not the cheap ones you find at the general goods store. \nThe Nords are excellent craftsmen, but for the rarest, most exquisite, most delectable, most vaingloriously spectacular fish, you must use rods of Alik'ri and Argonian make.\nIf you have managed to obtain such rods, then you are ready to embark on your final test. Good luck.\n&lt;poem&gt;\nAngelfish\nCaught in Temperate Lakes\nSmall in Size\nRarely Caught\nSeen in Any Weather\nCaught with Alik'ri Fishing Rod\n&lt;/poem&gt;\nThe angelfish is a rare jewel of a fish. They prefer freshwater lakes in mild climates, but they are far from delicate. While they are small, angelfish can be quite aggressive towards other fish.\nTheir natural habitat is a mystery, but stories of angelfish swimming in glades untouched by man or mer have sparked many fisherman's imaginations.\n&lt;poem&gt;\nAngler\nCaught in Freezing Waters\nLarge in Size\nRarely Caught\nSeen in Any Weather\nCaught with Argonian Fishing Rod\n&lt;/poem&gt;\nThe angler is an ugly brute of a fish that swims in the deepest trenches of the Sea of Ghosts. It fancies itself a fisherman by wearing a lure on its head to attract other fish. However, in this world there is always a bigger fish, and a bigger lure. You are the angler that will catch the angler, if your rod is up to it.\n&lt;poem&gt;\nLyretail Anthias\nCaught in Temperate Streams\nSmall in Size\nRarely Caught\nSeen in Any Weather\nCaught with Alik'ri Fishing Rod\n&lt;/poem&gt;\nIt is said that the lyretail anthias is a social butterfly. One look at its color and you can see why. Its vibrant scales make even an Argonian jealous. \nA local legend is one of a fisherman who became lost in the woods and was lured into a beautiful grove by the sound of the wind through the evergreen trees. There, he saw lyretail swimming in a pool that was clear as glass. Of course, the spriggan that dwelled there made his legend a short one.\n&lt;poem&gt;\nScorpion Fish\nCaught Underground\nLarge in Size\nRarely Caught\nCaught with Argonian Fishing Rod\n&lt;/poem&gt;\nThey say there exists a cavern so dark that it drives any who delve it to madness. It is in these untouched depths that the scorpion fish finds its home. They also say that fishermen have plenty of time to concoct the most outlandish of tales.\nWhen I think about the scorpion fish, I am reminded of the old tale about the frog and the scorpion. The scorpion wanted to cross the water, and the frog said \"Why don't we fish in the water instead?\" So that's what they did, and they became the best of friends.\nYou have made the fishing hero's journey, legendary fisherman. In conclusion, I will leave you with the words my master told me. \nThink back to the tripod spiderfish. In many ways, it is a lot like you. A fisherman can feel the movements of a fish underwater as they swim curiously around their hook. They make their lure an invitation rather than a threat. And when they sense the subtle tug on their line, they know the moment they must strike. It is an unexplainable oneness with nature, the lure, and their prey.\nNo matter your techniques or peculiar habits, the truth is on the hook. For when you catch the rarest of fish, you will have proven once and for all that you are a fishing legend, one who bows to no one."}

And five-fold felicitations on your glorious Aednavorith attestation! Your mother could barely contain her excitement on her last visit. How wonderful that your results surpassed even her wildest imaginings. As for me, I never had any doubt. We come from a prestigious line, and despite your father's ancestral deficiencies, I knew you would take on the finest aspects of our noble kin. I hear that your skin color and ear-shape reports were particularly favorable. What a relief! As we all know, ear-related flaws run deep in your father's line. How fortunate that you danced around that snare!\nNow, to business! In reference to your question, yes, our estate sponsors several fine young &lt;a href=\"Mer\"&gt;Mer&lt;/a&gt; of impeccable breeding. I will describe them here in detail, and attach their various attestations for you to peruse. I'm confident you'll find a worthy mate among them.\nThe first is Talanor\u2014a truly handsome Mer with ties to the prestigious Enruneldinion line. He enjoys the benefits of exceptional height, and the amber eyes characteristic of his father's descent. He suffers only minor flaws in skin color and jaw width, but these are easily overlooked, and likely recessive in nature. He knows his letters very well and excels in all schools of arcane practice. You won't find a more skillful mage at this age. A fine and dignified match, I assure you.\nNext is Hiruyon, son of Helebrim. You no doubt recognize the name. Helebrim is one of &lt;a href=\"Summerset%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Summerset&lt;/a&gt;'s foremost composers\u2014the kind of musical genius that arrives only once in a generation. Hiruyon, to his great credit, possesses many of his father's finer qualities. His singing voice is the envy of &lt;a href=\"Mara\"&gt;Mara&lt;/a&gt; herself, and he plays no than twelve instruments. Alas, his physical qualities fall short of stellar. His facial symmetry leaves something to be desired, due in large part to his smallish eyes. He also suffers from a slight enlargement at the bridge of the nose\u2014a trait indicative of cross-breeding with Men. I leave it to you to decide if such physical deficiencies overwhelm his ample talents and charming disposition. At the very least, his paternal accolades will serve you well at court.\nWe come at last to my favorite of the bunch: Pelanrel. Call me shallow if you wish! This fiery youth rivals &lt;a href=\"Trinimac\"&gt;Trinimac&lt;/a&gt; himself in terms of appearance and temperament. His countenance bears an uncanny resemblance to our &lt;a href=\"Aldmer\"&gt;Aldmer&lt;/a&gt;i forebears. Truly, he could have walked off a &lt;a href=\"kinlord\"&gt;kinlord&lt;/a&gt;'s tapestry. Wide almond eyes, ears as sharp as daggers, and the narrow, hawk-like aspect of our ancient kin. Marvelous! He displays great strength and speed on the sparring ground and the gaming field, and took to smithing like a lark to the wind. His only shortcomings lie in his magical and scholarly aptitude. But I have confidence that our shared ancestry would easily overcome such a weakness.\nWrite me back without delay, dearest niece! I'm anxious to find out which of these fine stallions you find most intriguing. If we move quickly, we may have a new child to spoil within the year!\nYour Loving Aunt,\n&lt;a href=\"Ambarre\"&gt;Ambarre&lt;/a&gt;"}

They are now forcing their way through Greenheart towards the Wilderking's throne.\"\nWalkthrough.\nContinue talking to &lt;a href=\"Maruin\"&gt;the Spinner&lt;/a&gt; after completing \"&lt;a href=\"The%20Witch%20of%20Silatar\"&gt;The Witch of Silatar&lt;/a&gt;.\" He says the Vestige needs to go to &lt;a href=\"Greenheart%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Greenheart&lt;/a&gt; and help the Wilderking as Aranias and Andur are getting closer to him.\nGreenheart is south of &lt;a href=\"Spinner%27s%20Cottage\"&gt;Spinner's Cottage&lt;/a&gt;. There is a &lt;a href=\"Wayshrines%20%28Online%29\"&gt;wayshrine&lt;/a&gt; near the quest marker. Once getting close enough to Greenheart, the quest objective will change to \"Speak to the Wilderking\" and he will appear near a bridge outside the town.\nThe Wilderking has lost control of his guardians and will die soon. Someone new must become guardian of &lt;a href=\"Valenwood%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Valenwood&lt;/a&gt;, and Aranias was guided to Greenheart for that purpose. The Vestige needs to stop Andur's influence over her, so she will accept it. She will need the Vestige's help to defeat him. They must follow the trail of fire to them.\nThe trail of fire is several small fires, each burning some distance away from the others. The quest marker is pointing to the cliffs above the waterfall, which might have been seen if they approach from the north.\nThe trail of fire leads into a destroyed building at the top of the cliff. Inside, the Wilderking appears from the rubble. Aranias knows that she is supposed to guide the Valenwood not destroy it, but she is unsure. She is afraid to stand up to Andur. Now is the time to act. Her powers grow as she approaches the throne. The Vestige needs to be there when she gets there. If they have the persuasion perk, they can ask the Wilderking to stop the forest animals from attacking them.\nThe Vestige enters the Throne Tunnels and finds them at the end. The Wilderking's spell will wear off as they go back outside, and the imps will start to attack. Continuing up the path, the Vestige sees an injured Aranias. She recognizes them as her friend from Silatar. She knows she has to stop Andur. She gives them a way to get past Andur's fires, and they hurry to stop Andur from killing the Wilderking.\nOnce Andur is dead, they make their way to the Throne Room where the Wilderking is sitting in his throne. He tells the Vestige that Aranias will become the Wilderqueen. She is upstairs about to be transformed. She needs the Vestige to put the Wilderking's crown in the garden upstairs. Place the crown on the dirt mound in the middle of the garden.\nAranias is now the Wilderqueen. She gives them &lt;a href=\"Ashenblade\"&gt;Ashenblade&lt;/a&gt; and gold as they wait for her to adjust to being Wilderqueen."}

If they agree, they are led to Henantier's house, where Henantier is asleep.\nWalkthrough.\nKud-Ei explains that Henantier created a \"&lt;a href=\"Dreamworld%20Amulet\"&gt;Dreamworld Amulet&lt;/a&gt;\" that would allow him to enter his &lt;a href=\"Dreamworld\"&gt;Dreamworld&lt;/a&gt;; he believed that he would be able to train himself by doing so, as he would control the content of this world.\nHowever, he has not awoken for three days. The Hero must wear the Dreamworld Amulet and sleep in the bed next to Henantier's in order to enter the Dreamworld and free him.\nInside the dreamworld, they have no inventory (although there are items scattered about which can be picked up and used). In addition, they are also &lt;a href=\"Silence%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;silenced&lt;/a&gt; and cannot use &lt;a href=\"magic\"&gt;magic&lt;/a&gt;. The dreamworld takes the form of a disheveled version of Henantier's house, in which Henantier is standing in a confused state.\nThere are four exits to the house, each leading to a test. There is no specific order in which the tests must be completed. However, if the player wants armor to protect against the traps in the other tests, they may want to complete the Test of Resolve first.\nTest of Patience.\nThe Test of Patience requires the Hero to figure out the same route across some trapped pressure plates.\nUpon entering the test, they are transported to a walkway suspended in darkness. In front of them is a reader which contains a \"Mysterious Scroll\". On this scroll are three patterns of &lt;a href=\"Daedric\"&gt;Daedric&lt;/a&gt; letters. Continuing along the walkway, they find a grid of stone pressure plates. Using the scroll as a guide, they must find the proper path across the plates.\nThe top of the scroll displays the solution to the first set of pressure plates, the middle displays the second, and finally the third solution. The first plate where they enter will be signified on the scroll by a certain character.\nThe Hero can only step onto one plate at first. Counting the plates on the ground will reveal which symbol represents that plate on the scroll. They must cross the grid by stepping on each of the plates represented by this symbol, or they take damage from several traps around the grid. The process is the same for the next two grids.\nNote that with high &lt;a href=\"Acrobatics%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;Acrobatics&lt;/a&gt;, it is possible to jump across the majority of each grid. It is also quite possible to simply sprint across each grid and \"wait out\" the damage afterward. The traps do far more damage than their real world counterparts, so be sure to grab the healing potions from the container downstairs before beginning the quest if attempting this method.\nAfter solving the puzzles, retrieve the Element of Patience at the end of the walkway. This will teleport the Hero back to Henantier.\nTest of Perception.\nThe Test of Perception tests the Hero's ability to recognize the presence of &lt;a href=\"Traps%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;traps&lt;/a&gt;. They are teleported to another floating walkway. The reader in front of them contains a torch, equip it.\nTravel along the walkway, using the torch's light to detect and avoid the pressure plates that trigger various traps. Note that stepping on a plate will not actually fail the test. The Hero can simply activate a pressure plate trap and back up; falling rock traps will be avoided altogether by doing this, while dropping blades will swing in a sequence and can be easily avoided by careful timing. On the last part of the walkway, simply avoid the pressure traps by jumping to the smooth stones.\nAt the end of the walkway, retrieve the Element of Perception.\nTest of Courage.\nThe Test of Courage tests the Hero's willingness to swim underwater for long periods of time. Grab the &lt;a href=\"Weak%20Potion%20of%20the%20Sea\"&gt;Weak Potion of the Sea&lt;/a&gt; in the reader. Then, swim through a long underwater tunnel, using the potion to avoid drowning. It is best to use the potion while swimming, once the air meter starts to get low. The potion will refill the meter and prevent it from dropping, maximizing the time the Hero can spend underwater. There is another water-breathing potion around halfway through the tunnel, though using the first potion in the manner described above should render it unnecessary. Note that wearing the armor acquired during the Test of Resolve will slow the Hero's swimming speed, increasing their reliance on the potions.\nIf the Hero is Argonian, they are still able to breathe water and this test will pose no challenge.\nAt the end of the tunnel is Grotto of Courage, which holds the Element of Courage.\nTest of Resolve.\nBefore entering this test, be sure to take the healing potions in a cupboard to the left of the doorway.\nThe Test of Resolve tests the Hero's strength and power. It takes place inside what looks like the &lt;a href=\"Imperial%20City%2C%20Arena%20District\"&gt;Imperial City Arena&lt;/a&gt; (although the yellow team's gate has been blocked). The reader contains a &lt;a href=\"Staves%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;staff&lt;/a&gt;, a &lt;a href=\"blade\"&gt;blade&lt;/a&gt; weapon, and &lt;a href=\"blunt\"&gt;blunt&lt;/a&gt; weapon (all of which vary depending on the Hero's level), and full sets of &lt;a href=\"Light%20Armor%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;light&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Heavy%20Armor%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;heavy&lt;/a&gt; armor (also level-dependent).\nIt is recommended to save the game at this point. Once equipped, enter the Arena. The gate shuts and two &lt;a href=\"Dreamworld%20Minotaur\"&gt;Dreamworld Minotaur&lt;/a&gt;s spawn, and must be killed. This can be an extremely difficult fight without the Hero's normal inventory. Disarming both of them helps. If the fight still proves difficult, the staff is recommended as the weapon of choice. Since the Minotaurs only have melee attacks, the Hero can run backwards around the arena while blasting them with the staff from outside their range. An alternative method is to allow the Minotaurs to spawn, then quickly retreat back toward the door before the gate closes. The Minotaurs are too big to fit in this hallway, and can be easily killed with the staff. Be careful though, as if one get too close to them, they can sometimes push their way into the hall. Is may also be possible to jump onto the sidelines of the Arena, and fire at the Minotaurs from outside their reach.\nOnce both Minotaurs have been defeated, stairs raise up from the ground and it is possible to complete the Test.\nCompletion.\nAfter collecting all four Elements, return to Henantier. He will transport the Hero and himself out of the Dreamworld, and the Hero's inventory will be returned. Their reward will be a few scrolls, such as &lt;a href=\"Rally%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;Heroic Touch&lt;/a&gt;, or &lt;a href=\"Fortify%20Magicka%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;Fortify Magicka&lt;/a&gt;."}

Speak with him and he will tell you that he wishes to speak with you about a disturbing message he got from an oracle, and will tell you to head to the mages guild in either &lt;a href=\"Davon%27s%20Watch%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Davon's Watch&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Daggerfall%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Daggerfall&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"Vulkhel%20Guard%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Vulkhel Guard&lt;/a&gt;, depending on your alliance. Head there and speak with him; he will tell you that the oracle in question is one of the wyresses of &lt;a href=\"Bangkorai\"&gt;Bangkorai&lt;/a&gt;, and that she might be in danger. He will ask you to go to her location and save her; he has prepared a magic boat that will bring you to her location. He will also give you a medalion of summoning, should there be a need for you to contact him.\nHead to the docks and board the enchanted boat. It will bring you to northern Bangkorai, near &lt;a href=\"Troll%27s%20Toothpick%20Wayshrine\"&gt;Troll's Toothpick Wayshrine&lt;/a&gt;. Head west from there to find the Oracle's dwelling. The house is under attack by Daedra; fight your way through, then speak with &lt;a href=\"Wyress%20Aelynn\"&gt;Wyress Aelynn&lt;/a&gt; once you are inside. She will tell you that the Oracle is not here; she probably fled to safety in the &lt;a href=\"Mines%20of%20Khuras%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Mines of Khunas&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Glenumbra%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Glenumbra&lt;/a&gt;. You can take your magic boat there or you can travel by yourself. Either way, head into the mines. The mines will be filled with &lt;a href=\"Bloodthorn%20Cultist\"&gt;Bloodthorn Cultist&lt;/a&gt;s, so you will have to fight your way through. In the watery room in the northwest, search the southeast of the room for a door to the Old Wyrd Site; it will be well hidden by moss and rocks so look carefully. In the passage way here, an enemy called the &lt;a href=\"Wraith-of-Crows\"&gt;Wraith-of-Crows&lt;/a&gt; will appear; he is very strong so be prepared. After he is defeated, head on and you will find a &lt;a href=\"Note%20to%20Vanus\"&gt;Note to Vanus&lt;/a&gt; from the oracle; this is the moment to use the Medalion of Summoning Vanus gave you. \nSpeak with Vanus and he will remark that there is a secret message in the letter. To disover the location of the Oracle, you must perform a ritual involving the elements. Look around for items that represent the elements of Air, Earth and Water. You will find an Uncut Gemstone in the north of the room, a hollowed gourd filled with water in the puddle and a feather in the south of the room. After you have all the items, speak with Vanus and he will tell you to place the items in the correct bowls, indicated by pictograms. The leftmost bowl is for the gemstone, the middle one is for the feather, and the one on the right is for the gourd. \nOnce you have succesfully performed the ritual, an apparition of &lt;a href=\"Oracle%20Marieve\"&gt;Oracle Marieve&lt;/a&gt; will appear. Speak with her and she will say that her visions show that &lt;a href=\"Summerset%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Summerset&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Artaeum%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Artaeum&lt;/a&gt; will soon be spun into a dark web by the &lt;a href=\"Daedric%20Princes\"&gt;Daedric Princes&lt;/a&gt;. She will say that they are taking her to an Aldmeri Ruin named &lt;a href=\"Bewan\"&gt;Bewan&lt;/a&gt;, then she will disappear. If you talk to Vanus Galerion about this, he will tell you that he cannot get involved in matters involving the Psijics of Artaeum, so you must go on without him. Either way, Bewan is in western &lt;a href=\"Auridon\"&gt;Auridon&lt;/a&gt;. You can take your magic boat there or travel there yourself. Head into the ruins and to the southernmost chamber. There, you will find the Daedra dragging Marieve through a portal; follow them through and you will find yourself in the &lt;a href=\"Spiral%20Skein\"&gt;Spiral Skein&lt;/a&gt;, the realm of the Daedric Prince &lt;a href=\"Mephala\"&gt;Mephala&lt;/a&gt;. You will be assaulted by several waves of spiders as you make your way through this realm, followed by a duel with &lt;a href=\"Viscount%20Lelorion\"&gt;Viscount Lelorion&lt;/a&gt; towards the end of the path. \nAt the end of the path, you will find Oracle Marieve trapped in spider silk. Speak with her and she will tell you that Mephala is trying to reach Artaeum through her; to free her, you must destroy the pinions that keep the web in place. Defeat the &lt;a href=\"Spider%20Daedra%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Spider Daedra&lt;/a&gt; guarding the pinions and destroy them, then head back to Marieve and destroy the Center Fulcrum, the construct to which she is attached. Once she is free, Marieve will open a portal to &lt;a href=\"Skywatch%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Skywatch&lt;/a&gt;; head through and talk to Marieve there. She will thank you for saving her and tell you that you were in time to stop the evil forces from finding Artaeum. After you are done talking with her, Vanus Galerion will appear; speak with him to finish the quest."}

The ritual to bind the spirits also needs to be completed in the nearby Daedric tower. After placing the skulls in the braziers, General Radrathren will appear and the fight will start. After defeating him, talk to Furon. He will say that the plan was a success, but also express his heavy regret in choosing such a torturous method. This will lead you to the quest \"&lt;a href=\"Wayward%20Son\"&gt;Wayward Son&lt;/a&gt;.\""}

In response, First Auridon Marines have arrived to aid the town.\"\nWalkthrough.\nTo start the quest, the &lt;a href=\"Vestige\"&gt;Vestige&lt;/a&gt; should speak to &lt;a href=\"Captain%20Landare\"&gt;Captain Landare&lt;/a&gt; before the bridge to city of &lt;a href=\"Dawnbreak\"&gt;Dawnbreak&lt;/a&gt;. She will say that they are under siege by the &lt;a href=\"Daedra\"&gt;Daedra&lt;/a&gt; and that whole city has been devastated. If the Vestige decides to help them out, Captain Landare will give them a list of citizens they need to find and round up at the manor in the middle of the city.\nThe nearest one to the bridge is &lt;a href=\"Elannie\"&gt;Elannie&lt;/a&gt;. If unable to persuade, the Vestige has to find her father &lt;a href=\"Almion\"&gt;Almion&lt;/a&gt; who told her to wait for him. Elannie tells them that he went to check on &lt;a href=\"Pirtar\"&gt;Pirtar&lt;/a&gt;. Pirtar will be found in a destroyed house near the fountain. Her father Almion however, is dead. The Vestige can take the pendant from him and give it back to Elannie.\nThe next one is &lt;a href=\"Fasaran\"&gt;Fasaran&lt;/a&gt; who lives just up the road. If unable to intimidate, the Vestige must find her wife's ring which he \"misplaced.\" The ring will be in a basket near a fireplace and, after giving him the ring, he will run to the manor house.\nThe next one is &lt;a href=\"Mirkalinde\"&gt;Mirkalinde&lt;/a&gt; whose house is just behind the fountain. She will ask the Vestige if the Marines are here and feel relieved after learning that they are. The Vestige will sent her south of town.\nAfter all people have been found, the Vestige it to report to Captain Landare at the Manor house. While speaking to the Captain, &lt;a href=\"Sergeant%20Artinaire\"&gt;Sergeant Artinaire&lt;/a&gt; will run in with a report. She will say that the Daedra have returned in force and have overrun them. The Captain now sends the Vestige to find and rescue marine patrols.\nIn order to do that, the Vestige must find 5 groups of marines who are fighting the Daedra on the outskirts of town or in nearby woods. After rescuing the marines, the Vestige has to speak with Sergeant Artinaire. She will find the Vestige on her own. She will tell them that Captain Landare has learned of a cave nearby said to be the cause of the Daedra and ran off to it. The Vestige has to find that cave and help her. The cave is located to the northeast of Dawnbreak, near a wayshrine.\nThe cave will be overflowing with Daedra so the Vestige has to find their way to the Captain. She will be in the first larger chamber looking over &lt;a href=\"Qoramir\"&gt;Qoramir&lt;/a&gt;, her patrol leader who is injured badly. The Captain will ask the Vestige to find a pair of Dremora who are preparing next mass summoning further up in the cave. The Vestige has to go alone, Captain Landare could not leave Qoramir in his current shape alone.\nArriving at the summoning ritual, the Vestige will encounter two &lt;a href=\"Dremora\"&gt;Dremora&lt;/a&gt;, named &lt;a href=\"Demis\"&gt;Demis&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Vintev\"&gt;Vintev&lt;/a&gt;. Both are bosses so fighting them might be a challenge. After defeating them both, the Vestige has to close the portal and report back to Captain Landare at the Manor house. After finding the Captain, she will say her thanks to the Vestige and reward them."}

{"id": "11331", "revid": "26213507", "url": "https://elderscrolls.fandom.com/wiki?curid=11331", "title": "Thu'um", "text": "The Thu'um, also referred to as Storm Voice or simply the Voice, is a form of magic which utilizes the &lt;a href=\"Dragon%20Language\"&gt;Dragon Language&lt;/a&gt; to form &lt;a href=\"Dragon%20Shouts\"&gt;Dragon Shouts&lt;/a&gt; of immense power. The word itself directly translates to the word \"shout\" in the Dragon language. Most shouts are made up of three words of power, and using more words usually strengthens the effects of the shout in some manner. In addition to the ability to project one's voice into a shout, the Thu'um can also be used to share the knowledge and meaning of a word of power with another practitioner of the Thu'um and carve the &lt;a href=\"Dragon%20Alphabet\"&gt;written form&lt;/a&gt; of the word into a nearby surface usually by using the shout or by whispering the word of power. Mortal practitioners of the Thu'um may lose the ability to speak without causing devastation and put people who are not trained in the &lt;a href=\"Way%20of%20the%20Voice\"&gt;Way of the Voice&lt;/a&gt; in danger due to the strength of their voices, though others may not suffer from such a condition.\nHistory.\nBeginning.\nIn the early ages of &lt;a href=\"Nirn\"&gt;Nirn&lt;/a&gt;, the only beings capable of using the Thu'um were the &lt;a href=\"Dragons%20%28Lore%29\"&gt;dragons&lt;/a&gt;, the children of &lt;a href=\"Akatosh\"&gt;Akatosh&lt;/a&gt;. The Thu'um was part of their natural language and could be utilized as a weapon. They abused this power to bring havoc upon the races of man during the late &lt;a href=\"Merethic%20Era\"&gt;Merethic Era&lt;/a&gt;. Among the leader of the dragons was &lt;a href=\"Alduin\"&gt;Alduin&lt;/a&gt;, the World-Eater, who claimed his father Akatosh's lordship. Humans who worshiped the dragons were part of the &lt;a href=\"Dragon%20Cult\"&gt;Dragon Cult&lt;/a&gt;.\nHuman rebellion.\n&lt;a href=\"Kyne\"&gt;Kyne&lt;/a&gt; had pitied man and tasked &lt;a href=\"Paarthurnax%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Paarthurnax&lt;/a&gt;, Alduin's younger brother and second-in-command, to betray the Dragons and teach man to use the Voice. The humans then used the voice to fight the dragons in what came to be known as the &lt;a href=\"Dragon%20War\"&gt;Dragon War&lt;/a&gt;. The ancient Nords created their own shout, &lt;a href=\"Dragonrend\"&gt;Dragonrend&lt;/a&gt;. They then used this shout, along with an &lt;a href=\"Elder%20Scroll%20%28Lore%29\"&gt;Elder Scroll&lt;/a&gt;, to send Alduin through time and end the age of the dragons.\nMiraak and Hermaeus Mora.\n&lt;a href=\"Miraak\"&gt;Miraak&lt;/a&gt;, a &lt;a href=\"Dragon%20Priests%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Dragon Priest&lt;/a&gt;, discovered he was the first &lt;a href=\"Dragonborn%20%28Lore%29\"&gt;Dragonborn&lt;/a&gt;. He betrayed his order and sought knowledge from &lt;a href=\"Hermaeus%20Mora\"&gt;Hermaeus Mora&lt;/a&gt;, a &lt;a href=\"Daedric%20Prince\"&gt;Daedric Prince&lt;/a&gt;. Mora taught him the shout &lt;a href=\"Bend%20Will\"&gt;Bend Will&lt;/a&gt;, a unique shout which could force people and dragons to do his bidding. Miraak was asked to help defeat Alduin, but refused. Because of his decision, the ancient Nords were unable to defeat Alduin and were forced to use an Elder Scroll to banish Alduin. Miraak instead used his shout to create an army, but in his foolishness, he believed he could depose all dragons. The dragons fought him, and tore &lt;a href=\"Solstheim\"&gt;Solstheim&lt;/a&gt; from &lt;a href=\"Skyrim\"&gt;Skyrim&lt;/a&gt; in battle. Miraak was defeated by his fellow priest &lt;a href=\"Vahlok%20the%20Jailor\"&gt;Vahlok&lt;/a&gt;, but was saved by Hermaeus Mora before the killing blow. His temple was then destroyed, and the dragons freed from his rule.\nMiraak's knowledge had grown so much that he managed to learn a shout with four words, an unusual phenomenon.\nKing Wulfharth.\nKing &lt;a href=\"Wulfharth\"&gt;Wulfharth&lt;/a&gt; was a Dragonborn and had mastery over the Thu'um. It is said his Thu'um was so powerful that he could not verbally swear into the office, and scribes were used to draw up his oaths. He learnt it when watching battles of using the Thu'um.\nCreation of the Greybeards.\nIn time man too had abused the voice. Instead of using it as a form of prayer or use of self-defense, they instead used it as a mere weapon. &lt;a href=\"Jurgen%20Windcaller\"&gt;Jurgen Windcaller&lt;/a&gt; founded &lt;a href=\"the%20Greybeards\"&gt;the Greybeards&lt;/a&gt; on the &lt;a href=\"Throat%20of%20the%20World\"&gt;Throat of the World&lt;/a&gt; and taught man to instead use the Thu'um as a force of peace and enlightenment, a teaching which now remains in the Greybeard code. Many greybeards have such a powerful Thu'um they could cause major destruction with a simple sentence.\nDuring the &lt;a href=\"Alliance%20War\"&gt;Alliance War&lt;/a&gt; the Nords of Skyrim made use of &lt;a href=\"Trebuchet\"&gt;Trebuchet&lt;/a&gt;s and &lt;a href=\"Ballista\"&gt;Ballista&lt;/a&gt;e, which also confirms that as of the Second Era the Nords stopped using the Voice for warfare.\nTiber Septim.\nThe future Emperor of the &lt;a href=\"Septim%20Empire\"&gt;Septim Empire&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Tiber%20Septim\"&gt;Tiber Septim&lt;/a&gt;, also known as General &lt;a href=\"Talos\"&gt;Talos&lt;/a&gt; was a Dragonborn taught by Wulfharth and the Greybeards how to use the voice. He made his way up the Throat of the World and entered &lt;a href=\"High%20Hrothgar%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;High Hrothgar&lt;/a&gt;. The Greybeards told Talos that he would become the chosen one who would defeat the Elves and become Emperor of a united Tamriel.\nUlfric Stormcloak.\n&lt;a href=\"Ulfric%20Stormcloak%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Ulfric Stormcloak&lt;/a&gt; was the &lt;a href=\"Jarl\"&gt;Jarl&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"Windhelm%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Windhelm&lt;/a&gt; who was taught under the Greybeards on how to use the voice. He then grew up to abandon the pacifist philosophy of the Greybeards and used it in combat during the &lt;a href=\"Markarth%20Incident\"&gt;Markarth Incident&lt;/a&gt; and against &lt;a href=\"High%20King%20Torygg\"&gt;High King Torygg&lt;/a&gt;.\nHowever, Ulfric mentions to the Dragonborn that he still doesn\u2019t take the Thu'um lightly even though he can\u2019t completely take to its philosophy.\nLast Dragonborn and Alduin.\nA hero called the &lt;a href=\"Last%20Dragonborn\"&gt;Last Dragonborn&lt;/a&gt; was a prisoner, about to be executed at &lt;a href=\"Helgen\"&gt;Helgen&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"4E%20201\"&gt;4E 201&lt;/a&gt;. Before their execution could happen, Alduin, the World-Eater, showed up after his travel through time and destroyed the town. This granted the hero with an escape.\nThe Last Dragonborn slew the dragon &lt;a href=\"Mirmulnir\"&gt;Mirmulnir&lt;/a&gt; and discovered they could absorb &lt;a href=\"Dragon%20Soul\"&gt;Dragon Soul&lt;/a&gt;s. They then used the Thu'um and were called upon by the Greybeards, who shouted \"Dovahkiin.\"\nThe Dragonborn journeyed up High Hrothgar and trained with the Greybeards. They then went on a mission to find out how to defeat Alduin and put an end to the &lt;a href=\"Dragon%20Crisis\"&gt;dragon threat&lt;/a&gt;.\nAfter discovering how to defeat Alduin, the Dragonborn then went on to defeat Alduin using the Thu'um in &lt;a href=\"Sovngarde%20%28Location%29\"&gt;Sovngarde&lt;/a&gt;.\nLast Dragonborn and Miraak.\nAt some point the Last Dragonborn was ambushed by a group of &lt;a href=\"cultist\"&gt;cultist&lt;/a&gt;s sent by Miraak. Upon investigating and arriving on Solstheim, the Dragonborn then discovered who Miraak was and how his history tied in with theirs.\nUpon completing multiple tasks for the &lt;a href=\"Skaal\"&gt;Skaal&lt;/a&gt; and Hermaeus Mora, the Last Dragonborn then learned the &lt;a href=\"Bend%20Will\"&gt;Bend Will&lt;/a&gt; shout, freed the All-Maker stones and Solstheim from Miraak's grasp and traveled to &lt;a href=\"Apocrypha\"&gt;Apocrypha&lt;/a&gt; to defeat Miraak. During this the Thu'um was used extensively, and was even known to have had a four word shout involved.\nLearning.\nThe Thu'um can be taught through many means to men, mer and beastfolk alike. Individuals who are Dragonborn can learn the Thu'um faster.\nTraining.\nWhile the Thu'um can easily be learnt by Dragonborn, it takes a much longer time to learn for regular people. Ulfric Stormcloak spent around ten years training with the Greybeards to learn the Thu'um.\nWord Walls.\nIn , words of power can be learnt from &lt;a href=\"Word%20Walls%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Word Walls&lt;/a&gt; found throughout &lt;a href=\"Tamriel\"&gt;Tamriel&lt;/a&gt;. Each wall often contains one word, and can only be used by those with the knowledge of the Thu'um.\nPassing of knowledge.\nShouts and words of power can be passed on from one another. This is demonstrated by the Greybeards."}

Their carapace is commonly purple and gold colored. Thunderbugs, while known to keep to themselves, can become very territorial when involving their young. They lay their eggs in dirt mounds near trees and rock outcroppings, then remain nearby to guard and protect the unhatched young from predators. If a predator is lucky enough to sneak up close and get an egg, the thunderbug is very cautious so as not to harm its young. They will not attack if it could end up endangering its eggs, but once the eggs are safe they will retaliate with deadly force.\nThunderbugs attack using electrical energy that they create. They can attack its enemies with an electrical bite, or fire a ranged electrical shock burst towards its target. It is said that some thunderbugs are large enough that they can cause a small weather phenomenon, creating lighting and thunder.\u00a0The electrical shock that the beetles release is quite powerful, and has been known to kill small creatures, such as &lt;a href=\"Rat%20%28Online%29\"&gt;rats&lt;/a&gt;, on contact. This feature has led some on rare occasion to employ Thunderbugs as a means of controlling pests, such as on &lt;a href=\"Moon%20Sugar%20%28Online%29\"&gt;moon sugar&lt;/a&gt; plantations.\nQuests.\n&lt;a href=\"A%20Pinch%20of%20Sugar\"&gt;A Pinch of Sugar&lt;/a&gt;.\nTo get rid of the rat infestation at &lt;a href=\"Laughing%20Moons%20Plantation\"&gt;Laughing Moons Plantation&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Cinder-Tail\"&gt;Cinder-Tail&lt;/a&gt; suggests that the &lt;a href=\"Vestige\"&gt;Vestige&lt;/a&gt; grab Thunderbug eggs and smash them on the rat nests.

A group of adventurers eventually found the ruins of the city and fought Thurvokun and successfully killed him but at the cost of their own lives.\nIn the &lt;a href=\"Second%20Era\"&gt;Second Era&lt;/a&gt;, a group of &lt;a href=\"necromancer\"&gt;necromancer&lt;/a&gt;s called the &lt;a href=\"Blackmarrow%20Cult\"&gt;Blackmarrow Cult&lt;/a&gt; led by a &lt;a href=\"Nords%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Nord&lt;/a&gt; named Orryn the Black found the city and the dragon's bones and decided to make a powerful weapon out of them. The &lt;a href=\"Vestige\"&gt;Vestige&lt;/a&gt; was sent to stop this from happening and was able to kill Orryn and Thurvokun's reanimated bones."}

I've agreed to help her close the portal.\"\nWalkthrough.\nNear &lt;a href=\"Salas%20En\"&gt;Salas En&lt;/a&gt;, you will run into &lt;a href=\"Lady%20Clarisse%20Laurent\"&gt;Lady Clarisse Laurent&lt;/a&gt;. She will tell you that she found a portal in the Ayleid Ruins, and that she sent &lt;a href=\"Stibbons\"&gt;Stibbons&lt;/a&gt; through to investigate. However, it turned out to be a portal to &lt;a href=\"Grahtwood\"&gt;Grahtwood&lt;/a&gt;, and the &lt;a href=\"Aldmeri%20Dominion%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Aldmeri Dominion&lt;/a&gt; is now looking to use it to launch an invasion into &lt;a href=\"Hammerfell%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Hammerfell&lt;/a&gt;. She will ask for your help in closing the portal. She found a tome that explains how, but she had to leave it behind when fleeing from the dominion troops.\nYour first order of business is recovering the book. It should be to the northwest of your location; in Lady Laurent's camp. You will also fond the lorebook \"&lt;a href=\"The%20Salas%20En%20Expedition\"&gt;The Salas En Expedition&lt;/a&gt;\" here, as well as Stibbons, who will give you the quest \"&lt;a href=\"Lady%20Laurent%27s%20Favor\"&gt;Lady Laurent's Favor&lt;/a&gt;.\" That quest takes place in the same areas as this one, so it is efficient to do both simultaneously. Either way, once you have the book, you should use it to activate the pillars around Salas En to open the ruin's back entrance; the elves have sealed the main entrance. The pillars are in each of the four cardinal directions from the ruins; near the south pillar, you will find a Skyshard, so be sure to pick that up.\nOnce all of the pillars have been activated, head into the lower ruins and speak with Lady Laurent there. She will tell you that the room with the portal is just past the door, but that the door is locked. Lady Laurent suspects that there will be a switch deeper in the ruins that will allow you to open the door; he will task you with finding it. Head through the passageway to the big room on the other side of the ruins; the switch you are looking for will be on the side of the stairs. In this room, you will also find an orc named &lt;a href=\"Gurlak\"&gt;Gurlak&lt;/a&gt; who has been trapped by Ayleid magic; speaking with him will start the quest \"&lt;a href=\"The%20Oldest%20Orc\"&gt;The Oldest Orc&lt;/a&gt;.\" This quest takes place entirely in this room, so it can be a good idea to do it while you are here. Either way, press the button and head to the portal chamber.\nOnce you have entered the portal chamber, talk to Lady Laurent. She will tell you that she can close the portal, but that once she starts, they will notice it on the other side and send troops through to stop her. She will ask you to protect her while she closes the portal. After you are done talking, Lady Laurent will start the ritual and you will have to fend off several waves of elves before Lady Laurent successfully closes the portal. After it is closed, talk to Lady Laurent to finish the quest."}

{"id": "1548", "revid": "50714989", "url": "https://elderscrolls.fandom.com/wiki?curid=1548", "title": "Tiber Septim", "text": "Emperor Tiber Septim, also called Hjalti Early-Beard, General Talos Stormcrown, the Red King, and &lt;a href=\"Ysmir\"&gt;Ysmir&lt;/a&gt;, was a &lt;a href=\"Dragonborn%20%28Lore%29\"&gt;Dragonborn&lt;/a&gt; and the first &lt;a href=\"Emperor\"&gt;Emperor&lt;/a&gt; of the &lt;a href=\"Septim%20Empire\"&gt;Septim Empire&lt;/a&gt;. He is regarded as one of &lt;a href=\"Tamriel\"&gt;Tamriel&lt;/a&gt;'s most famous figures, having been the only one in history to unite the continent. Starting with his service under the Cyrodilic emperor &lt;a href=\"Cuhlecain\"&gt;Cuhlecain&lt;/a&gt;, Tiber Septim fought under the name \"General Talos\" to unify &lt;a href=\"Cyrodiil\"&gt;Cyrodiil&lt;/a&gt;, eventually succeeding or usurping Cuchlecain and becoming emperor. After his unification of Tamriel, an effort that culminated in the birth of the Third Empire, he ended the lengthy &lt;a href=\"Interregnum\"&gt;Interregnum&lt;/a&gt; and began the &lt;a href=\"Third%20Era\"&gt;Third Era&lt;/a&gt;. Tiber Septim gave his name to the lineage of Cyrodiil Emperors, the &lt;a href=\"Septim%20Dynasty\"&gt;Septims&lt;/a&gt;. Upon his death he became the deity &lt;a href=\"Talos\"&gt;Talos&lt;/a&gt; and took his place in the pantheon of the &lt;a href=\"Nine%20Divines\"&gt;Nine Divines&lt;/a&gt;.\nBiography.\nAccounts differ on Tiber Septim's biography. There are two commonly accepted theories, with the first usually taking precedence over the latter.\nOrthodoxy.\nThe most commonly accepted story within the Empire is that Tiber Septim was born in Atmora as Talos, meaning Stormcrown in Ehlnofex, hence Talos Stormcrown. He had a brother named &lt;a href=\"Agnorith%20Septim\"&gt;Agnorith&lt;/a&gt;. He grew up in Skyrim and learned the ways of war there. Talos became General of the Colovian Estates under King (and later Emperor) Cuhlecain. General Talos met the combined army of Skyrim and High Rock,\u00a0who were hostile to Cuhlecain, on the cliffs of Sancre Tor. The Skyrim army joined him when they saw him use the thu'um and knew him to be blood of the Dragon and heir to the Empires of Men. However, there are also records that state that the Nords joined Tiber Septim after he had caught them off guard.\nCuhlecain and Talos conquered West Cyrodiil in one year. No one could stand before Talos' storms. They marched east and the enemy's &lt;a href=\"battlemage\"&gt;battlemage&lt;/a&gt;s surrendered before their armies. In &lt;a href=\"2E%20854\"&gt;2E 854&lt;/a&gt; they conquered the &lt;a href=\"Imperial%20City\"&gt;Imperial City&lt;/a&gt; and thus gained the full control over Cyrodiil. That year, a High Rock nightblade managed to assassinate Cuhlecain and slit Talos's throat, burning the palace in the process. Talos survived, but he could no longer shout, instead leading armies with a whisper. At one point, Talos had an affair with &lt;a href=\"Barenziah\"&gt;Barenziah&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"Morrowind\"&gt;Morrowind&lt;/a&gt;, who became pregnant. Talos quickly had the unborn child aborted to prevent conflict with his legitimate heir.\nThe human kingdoms were conquered, even &lt;a href=\"Hammerfell\"&gt;Hammerfell&lt;/a&gt;, which was predicted to be an arduous task. After sending the commander of the &lt;a href=\"New%20West%20Navy\"&gt;New West Navy&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Amiel%20Richton\"&gt;Amiel Richton&lt;/a&gt; to &lt;a href=\"Stros%20M%27kai\"&gt;Stros M'kai&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"Battle%20of%20Stros%20M%27kai\"&gt;Battle of Stros M'kai&lt;/a&gt; had begun. Richton's assassin &lt;a href=\"Dram\"&gt;Dram&lt;/a&gt; shot a poisoned arrow at Hammerfell's Prince &lt;a href=\"A%27Tor\"&gt;A'Tor&lt;/a&gt;, killing him and defeating the last of the Crown resistance. After this Tiber Septim appointed Amiel Richton as provisional governor of the island.\nAfter the conquest of Hammerfell, Tiber turned to &lt;a href=\"Morrowind\"&gt;Morrowind&lt;/a&gt;. Following some initial skirmishes and after increasing internal friction between Morrowind's &lt;a href=\"Great%20Houses\"&gt;Great Houses&lt;/a&gt;, a treaty was signed by either Tiber or Zurin Arctus. This included &lt;a href=\"Vivec\"&gt;Vivec&lt;/a&gt; giving the &lt;a href=\"Numidium\"&gt;Numidium&lt;/a&gt; to Tiber in exchange for a higher degree of autonomy and self-rule for Morrowind.\nThe acquisition of the Numidium allowed Tiber to conquer the Summerset Isles, completing the conquest of Tamriel in 2E 896. Upon conquering all of Tamriel, Tiber declared that the following year a new era should begin, and thus the &lt;a href=\"Third%20Era\"&gt;Third Era&lt;/a&gt; began. Tiber Septim's thirty-eight year reign is described as \"lawful, pious, and glorious age.\" Tiber Septim is known for reviving the Cult of the One, and erecting &lt;a href=\"Temple%20of%20the%20One\"&gt;a Temple&lt;/a&gt; dedicated to it within the &lt;a href=\"Imperial%20City\"&gt;Imperial City&lt;/a&gt;. Tiber also published the &lt;a href=\"Pocket%20Guide%20to%20the%20Empire%2C%20First%20Edition\"&gt;Pocket Guide to the Empire, First Edition&lt;/a&gt; in an attempt to make his newly found empire feel more united. Tiber Septim died in &lt;a href=\"3E%2038\"&gt;3E 38&lt;/a&gt;, and was succeeded by his grandson, &lt;a href=\"Pelagius%20Septim\"&gt;Pelagius&lt;/a&gt;.\nHeresy.\nTiber Septim was born on the island kingdom &lt;a href=\"Alcaire\"&gt;Alcaire&lt;/a&gt;, as Hjalti Early-Beard, in &lt;a href=\"2E%20828\"&gt;2E 828&lt;/a&gt;, where he learned to use a sword. &lt;a href=\"Nords\"&gt;Nords&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Bretons\"&gt;Bretons&lt;/a&gt; had been fighting for centuries at the northern border of Falkreath, a kingdom in the &lt;a href=\"Colovian%20Estates\"&gt;Colovian Estates&lt;/a&gt;. At the age of twenty, Hjalti led the forces of Skyrim against the Reachmen of High Rock. During those days he met &lt;a href=\"Cuhlecain\"&gt;Cuhlecain&lt;/a&gt;, the king of Falkreath, who came to secure his northern border. They became allies and Hjalti was named general of the joined forces. Hjalti was a shrewd tactician, and his small band of Colovian troops and Nord berserkers broke the Reachmen's line, forcing them back beyond the gates of Old Hrol'dan. A siege seemed impossible, as Hjalti could expect no reinforcements from Falkreath. That night a storm came and visited Hjalti's camp. Hidden in the storm was &lt;a href=\"Wulfharth\"&gt;Wulfharth&lt;/a&gt;, a long-dead Nordic king, who spoke with him in his tent and taught him the &lt;a href=\"Way%20of%20the%20Voice\"&gt;Way of the Voice&lt;/a&gt;. At dawn, Hjalti went up to the gates, and the storm followed just above his head. He shouted down the walls of Old Hrol'dan, and his men poured in. After their victory, the Nords called Hjalti \"&lt;a href=\"Talos\"&gt;Talos&lt;/a&gt;\", meaning \"Stormcrown\".\nCuhlecain's intent was to crown himself emperor. But Talos was still haunted by the prophecy given him by the Greybeards. Before Cuhlecain could be crowned, Talos secretly murdered him. The &lt;a href=\"Imperial%20Palace\"&gt;Imperial Palace&lt;/a&gt; was burned to the ground in the action, and Talos slit his own throat to take the suspicion off of him. Though he lived, his Voice failed him. To prevent Cyrodiil from falling apart again, &lt;a href=\"Zurin%20Arctus\"&gt;Zurin Arctus&lt;/a&gt;, the Grand &lt;a href=\"Battlemage\"&gt;Battlemage&lt;/a&gt;, crowned Talos as Tiber Septim, new Emperor of Cyrodiil. In order to hide his involvement in the assassination, a lie was made that Tiber's own throat was cut.\nFollowing the assassination, Hjalti enlisted the help of both Ysmir Wulfharth and Zurin Arctus to help administer the empire. Ysmir was consistently pushing for further invasions of Hammerfell and Morrowind, but Tiber resisted his urgings. Wulfharth ultimately left Tiber in disgust at his inaction. Hammerfell and Morrowind were ultimately brought into the empire by a combination of peaceful accommodation and support of various warring factions, rather than unilateral conquest.\nIn that time, the great\u00a0&lt;a href=\"Dunmer\"&gt;Dunmer&lt;/a&gt; general &lt;a href=\"Symmachus\"&gt;Symmachus&lt;/a&gt;, a friend of Tiber Septim's, brought &lt;a href=\"Barenziah\"&gt;Barenziah&lt;/a&gt; to the Imperial City where she met the Emperor and they fell in love. The Emperor and Barenziah engaged in an affair but it was soon discovered that Barenziah was pregnant. Septim determined that he could not allow such a threat to his son's dominion and so ordered a healer to force Barenziah to miscarry. Barenziah was dispatched from the Imperial City very soon after this.\nAfter receiving the Numidium from the Tribunal, Tiber Septim summoned Wulfharth back to his court, saying that he had been right all along. On his return, Tiber seized him and had his soul ripped out to power the &lt;a href=\"Mantella\"&gt;Mantella&lt;/a&gt;, a soul gem that functioned as the power source for Numidium. This allowed the device to be activated and complete Tiber's conquest of the Summerset Isles. He would rule over a united Tamriel for thirty-eight years until his death in &lt;a href=\"3E%2038\"&gt;3E 38&lt;/a&gt;.\nRace.\nThe exact race of Tiber Septim is unknown, but what is known is that he was not a &lt;a href=\"Mer\"&gt;Mer&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"Beastfolk\"&gt;Beastfolk&lt;/a&gt;, but a subspecies of &lt;a href=\"Men\"&gt;Men&lt;/a&gt;.\nIf the statement that he is from &lt;a href=\"Alcaire\"&gt;Alcaire&lt;/a&gt; is true, then he was most likely a &lt;a href=\"Breton\"&gt;Breton&lt;/a&gt;. It is said that Emperor &lt;a href=\"Cephorus%20Septim%20II\"&gt;Cephorus Septim II&lt;/a&gt; was the first Emperor of the Septim Dynasty to have been neither a Breton nor having spent any childhood in High Rock, which would mean that Tiber Septim could have been a Breton. According to Kier-jo, General Stormcrown was a Breton, not a &lt;a href=\"Nord\"&gt;Nord&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href=\"Kyne\"&gt;Kyne&lt;/a&gt; also refers to him as a \"manmer\" in &lt;a href=\"Michael%20Kirkbride\"&gt;Michael Kirkbride&lt;/a&gt;'s C0DA, and Bretons are both man and mer.\nIf the statement that he is from &lt;a href=\"Atmora\"&gt;Atmora&lt;/a&gt; is true, then he was most likely an &lt;a href=\"Atmoran\"&gt;Atmoran&lt;/a&gt; or Nord. Some sources say that Septim was an Atmoran, but not a Nord. &lt;a href=\"Heimskr\"&gt;Heimskr&lt;/a&gt; says that Tiber Septim was a Nord.\nTalos' avatar, &lt;a href=\"Wulf\"&gt;Wulf&lt;/a&gt;, was an Imperial, and was stated to look like the figure on the &lt;a href=\"Septim%20%28Coin%29\"&gt;Septim coins&lt;/a&gt;, which would imply that Tiber Septim might have been an Imperial.\nPhysical appearance.\nTiber Septim was described by Queen Barenziah. He was of average height, half a head shorter than &lt;a href=\"Symmachus\"&gt;Symmachus&lt;/a&gt;, well-knit of figure and flexible of movement. He had a winning smile, bright blue eyes, and his hair was stark white, while his face was lined and weathered. Barenziah presumed his age ranged from forty to sixty years old at the time. Other features of Tiber Septim were a ruthless brow and powerful chin.\nGodhood.\nTalos died in &lt;a href=\"3E%2038\"&gt;3E 38&lt;/a&gt;, and was succeeded by his grandson, Pelagius. After his death Septim is believed by most to have ascended to godhood. He became Talos again, the God of War and Governance, for after a lifetime of war, he had united Tamriel for the first time in history. Upon his ascension the &lt;a href=\"Eight%20Divines\"&gt;Eight Divines&lt;/a&gt;\u00a0became the &lt;a href=\"Nine%20Divines\"&gt;Nine&lt;/a&gt;.\nDuring the &lt;a href=\"Great%20War\"&gt;Great War&lt;/a&gt; between the Empire and the Aldmeri Dominion however, peace was agreed upon with one of the conditions being that the Empire cease to recognize Talos as one of the Divines. After word got out that the Empire wasn't enforcing the Talos ban, the Thalmor had all shrines to him removed from the temples in towns loyal to the Empire. The &lt;a href=\"Stormcloaks\"&gt;Stormcloaks&lt;/a&gt;\u00a0in the province of\u00a0&lt;a href=\"Skyrim\"&gt;Skyrim&lt;/a&gt; reject the &lt;a href=\"White-Gold%20Concordat\"&gt;White-Gold Concordat&lt;/a&gt; that instates this law.\nLegacy.\nUpon the death of &lt;a href=\"Pelagius%20Septim\"&gt;Pelagius Septim&lt;/a&gt;, Tiber Septim's line switched to Pelagius' cousin &lt;a href=\"Kintyra%20Septim\"&gt;Kintyra&lt;/a&gt; and her heirs, who were the descendants of Tiber Septim's brother, &lt;a href=\"Agnorith%20Septim\"&gt;Agnorith&lt;/a&gt;. Tiber Septim was the founder of the &lt;a href=\"Septim%20Dynasty\"&gt;Septim Dynasty&lt;/a&gt;, which ruled Tamriel for the entire &lt;a href=\"Third%20Era\"&gt;Third Era&lt;/a&gt; until the bloodline died out with &lt;a href=\"Martin%20Septim\"&gt;Martin Septim&lt;/a&gt;.\n&lt;a href=\"Tribunal\"&gt;Tribunal&lt;/a&gt; goddess &lt;a href=\"Almalexia\"&gt;Almalexia&lt;/a&gt; commissioned &lt;a href=\"Almalexia%20%28City%29\"&gt;an expansion&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"Mournhold\"&gt;Mournhold&lt;/a&gt; as a reaction to Septim's rising greatness, returning the city to its former glory since its destruction in &lt;a href=\"1E%202920\"&gt;1E 2920&lt;/a&gt;. The expansion was finished in the early Third Era. An aspect of Tiber Septim appeared in &lt;a href=\"3E%20427\"&gt;3E 427&lt;/a&gt;, as a retired Imperial Legionnaire named &lt;a href=\"Wulf\"&gt;Wulf&lt;/a&gt;. He aids the &lt;a href=\"Nerevarine\"&gt;Nerevarine&lt;/a&gt; by asking him to keep his &lt;a href=\"Old%20Man%27s%20Lucky%20Coin\"&gt;lucky coin&lt;/a&gt; while they journey to Red Mountain on their &lt;a href=\"The%20Citadels%20of%20the%20Sixth%20House\"&gt;quest&lt;/a&gt; to defeat &lt;a href=\"Dagoth%20Ur%20%28Character%29\"&gt;Dagoth Ur&lt;/a&gt;. Later, an Imperial &lt;a href=\"Lalatia%20Varian\"&gt;priest&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Ebonheart\"&gt;Ebonheart&lt;/a&gt; tells the Nerevarine that Wulf may have actually been a divine manifestation of Tiber Septim and that this visitation may be \"a sign of great doom\" for the Hero. Wulf's dialogue regarding the weakening empire and &lt;a href=\"Uriel%20Septim%20VII\"&gt;old emperor&lt;/a&gt; later occurred during the &lt;a href=\"Oblivion%20Crisis\"&gt;Oblivion Crisis&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"3E%20433\"&gt;3E 433&lt;/a&gt;, with the Septim bloodline ending with Martin Septim's sacrifice.\nConflicting reports.\nThere are still conflicting reports about Tiber's life due to many aspects of his early reign being rewritten, and this is why there is such confusion over his origins.

You left plenty on the stairwells, in my hall here, and all over the courtyard. And then there\u2019s the matter of a &lt;a href=\"Battlespire\"&gt;Battlespire&lt;/a&gt; stuck into the southern side of the moon, as if &lt;a href=\"Masser\"&gt;Masser&lt;/a&gt; were about to play the flute. But that\u2019s not the real question, &lt;a href=\"Redguard\"&gt;Redguard&lt;/a&gt;. The question is: why are you here in the first place?\u201d\n\u201cOh, it\u2019s you. Took long enough.\u201d\n\u201cYou made sure it was loud enough again. And this time you didn\u2019t run.\u201d\n\u201cNo, I ran. You just have too many guards.\u201d\n\u201cCan I really have too many? Get back to the question, please.\u201d\n\u201cYou know the answer. You got pretty loud yourself.\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019m sorry about your friend. I am. Tell me that\u2019s not why you\u2019re really here. He hated you, he said.\u201d\n\u201cHe did. Things got bad. Doesn\u2019t change anything.\u201d\n\u201cAh. Your famous honor. And here I figured you were going to steal something.\u201d\n\u201cYeah, that\u2019s still part of the plan. Now unlock me. And a sword would be nice.\u201d\n\u201cMaybe in a little while, just let me have a word. The way you handled the Altmer was impressive. I could always use a good general these days. Or an admiral, even, if you\u2019re better at sea. According to this, you know all about my admirals.\u201d\n\u201cYou\u2019ve got to be kidding me.\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019m not. I would give your honor a better place and this I swear. Mine is the Voice of the &lt;a href=\"Emperor\"&gt;Emperor&lt;/a&gt;.\u201d\n\u201cThat\u2019s exactly what I came to steal.\u201d\nTiber Septim\u2019s Sword-Meeting with Cyrus the Restless.\nPhynayesteryear 4558 SIY, 3E_____ CIY, all reckonings/refractions in sorted order, en masse obliged in hope, re: the Incident of the Sura-hoon Maneuver in the Masser, and of the treaties broken there and the treaties thereafter having needs to be reinstated with new addenda, namely: the Get Out of His Way lash-tag v.2.4245, recognized now both in ThirdEmpireMen (hereafter TEM) and ThalmorEmissariesMasser (hereafter TEM), unless should there be Opportunity by One or the Other Power to capture/ kill/ interrogate-from-crew (presently, the \u201cCarrick\u201d) without breaking those measures now writ in the aforementioned reworked accords, on threat of annulment from the TEM, and taken from that first voidship present at Incident, these the annals-at-panel of the Alinor Sunbird SMIS Longbow, may they not rest in peace, 187 souls aboard in sum.\nThe mirror-make of the SMIS Longbow started up, spinning in glass collectors set to catch the sun\u2019s warnings of threat. Its bridge unfolded, and the high elves of its helm folded out from their collective to panel stations, lathered in micro-seconds by their protocolinachs in the filaments of emergency varliance to protect their skins and uniforms from immediate death by aetherfire.\nThe First of First Mates slotted into his harvester and barked the obvious. \u201cLower the sun song fifty, or we\u2019ll feel the singe. Rotate our prayers and bring her up. What have we got?\u201d\nThe Master of Lillandrils-at-Void went to rote, his teeth a cricket quick-click sound, \u201cHelm crew unfolded none have perished give utmost thanks to the filaments solar wings sectored out and pulling towards starboard their \u2018ractals math\u2019d and working the bridge is stage set safe for the Aldmerality talk-box if need with the mirror-make uncracked keeping luck where it should be our sunbird is a go.\u201d\n\u201cAll hands, all hands, this is the First of First Mates, Terror Thought, and we are now at full sail. Salute me and begin. Turn the Mirror and show us.\u201d\nThe mirror-make\u2019s nymic was pronounced by the helm in unison, going Logician. The Mirror, nautical once more, became pleased with itself, purring. It zoom shunted monocles on to the fifty-plus bridge crew members with its blowgun-like pneumatic brass-glass branches. Those that weren\u2019t ready or properly trained fell screaming or in silence from shards to face or mouth. Terror Thought shook his head. \u201cI will have to fill out forms for that! Ancestry for the fallen, though it does us no favor! Mirror on the deck.\u201d\nThe Mirror blurred, warbling the Longbow for a moment. A few more were lost to nausea and the filaments ate their glands for restoration. Sectoring out further toward the upper and outer bulkheads, the Mirror made windows. \u201cWe are awake and knowing. Void-eyes on. Stare between &lt;a href=\"Oblivion%20%28Realm%29\"&gt;Oblivion&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Aetherius\"&gt;Aetherius&lt;/a&gt; with a purpose. An unknown vessel is detected on the changewinds of our charter.\u201d\n\u201cThat\u2019s not possible,\u201d typed the Scribe, young by &lt;a href=\"Alinor\"&gt;Alinor&lt;/a&gt; standards, never-year\u2019d now in this, her first protector ticket across the moons. \u201cSeptim promised us no tricks.\u201d\n\u201cIt\u2019s not Septim. Let the Lillandris bring it up on Mirror.\u201d\nAnother warbling and it was spotted, the vessel that woke the sun threats at the start. Terror Thought looked, thought, and then said aloud: \u201cWhat the hell is that? It looks like... Scribe, describe it for the record and then suggest.\u201d\n\u201cPermission to talk without sense for the moment, but the vessel is mundrial, sir, wood with canvas sails, no void stones to engine it out here at all. It\u2019s only seaworthy by every account and yet their course seems set for Masser.\u201d\nThe Mirror shunted again, retracting off the monocles of those that needed to say a prayer to keep their belief-of-self intact. \u201cWhat should really trouble you, Terror Thought, is that they are waving at us.\u201d\n\u201cExplain.\u201d\nThe Scribe lightly coughed for effect and cocked her head. \u201cI don\u2019t understand how they\u2019re doing it, sir, but they\u2019re sailing through the void and flying their colors on a wind that they seem to have brought from &lt;a href=\"Mundus\"&gt;Mundus&lt;/a&gt;. And by waving at us, the Mirror means their flag. It bears a strange mark, seemingly scribbled in a language I can\u2019t translate, but I infer it\u2019s intended for Longbow. In short, they want to be seen by us, sir.\u201d\nThe First of First Mates then cocked his own head, his eyes flitting bird-like from one window to another, scanning them, moving inside his own known senses.\n\u201cHold! I see its reflection now. Give me another salute, for we are about to make history.\u201d\n\u201cThat\u2019s a wonderful thought, sir,\u201d the Scribe typed. \u201cI never thought I would live to see a chapter mark. Priming the cannon; our sunbeam is already up. I will footnote now my request: your consideration for breeding with me after our triumph.\u201d\nThe bridge moved across plates so that all still alive could witness the answer to the engagement. The talk-box erupted with excited chatter and the placement of bets in the engine room. Terror Thought sighed and pressed his heel, moving the plates back to their proper panels. Monocles socketed back in.\n\u201cI recognize the language of their rags, everyone. It\u2019s a Yoku dare: \u2018May the Devil Take the Hindmost.\u2019 Very well, all other Thalmoric prism mandates go into crystal for the moment. Hit the solar twelvewind and give chase. We have ourselves some pirates!\u201d\n\u201cThat wasn\u2019t funny, Coyle,\u201d Cyrus said, folding his telescope. The rest of the Carrickers were at their stations, ready to scramble at moment\u2019s notice. The young Yokudan glanced over at his captain, smiling.\n\u201cFornower\u2019s idea, really,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd we had spare paint. I wonder if they notice that our flag is an Imga cape.\u201d\nCyrus stared at him hard. \u201cYou see their sunbeam? You can\u2019t miss it, Coyle, spyglass or not. I\u2019m still seeing double. That thing can--\u201d\n\u201cGood. Then you won\u2019t know which Coyle to punch. C\u2019mon, cap, it\u2019s Old Mary. They\u2019re no better at catching us here than they were in the Divide.\u201d\nCyrus grabbed his vest from the rail, shaking his head while buttoning it. He laughed a little.\n\u201cYou\u2019re an idiot, boy\u201d he said. \u201cBut you\u2019re probably right. And it was smart to have them follow us.\u201d\n\u201cI know.\u201d\n\u201cDon\u2019t get cocky. Go on and have the men beat the sloadbags. We need the speed. You\u2019ve given me an idea.\u201d\n\u201cAye-aye, sir.\u201d\nCoyle made motion and joined the scramble himself, taking up the cattle-prods that Gar had reworked with enchantments. The crew carefully speared the fleshy spores attached to the sides of the Carrick and hissing sounds followed.\nThras gas steered them into a new wake, and Cyrus watched his men with something akin to pride on his face. It lasted but a moment, when the sunbeam of Longbow fired, a length of fire splitting the void behind him. Thorpe moved to look for scorches.\n\u201cM\u2019sorry, Cy, the lads were just having their fun. It\u2019s your own fault, you know, getting them all riled up and fearless, their eyes on a prize you challenged them to be impossible.\u201d\nThere\u2019s a fine line between madhouse and mutiny, Cyrus thought, but this isn\u2019t one of them. The old scrub was right. I wonder if I\u2019ve been with them too long now, changing their heads like this over and over again.\n\u201cTobias,\u201d he said. Thorpe heard him, thinking it a call for order, realizing it wasn\u2019t. The captain was acting right weird these days, but some might just argue it was the void. It had a tendency to drive men to questioning.\nAch, get out from there, laddie. You\u2019re under the cat\u2019s clamdesk again. Thorpe\u2019s just near the same out in the alley. Chamberpotted him to wake up, so I\u2019ve got none for you. We need to move. Dunmereth\u2019s a long way from here and I\u2019ve decided not to use the Pass. We\u2019re going through it up the gut instead. I\u2019m not taking any chances, even if it means lizards.\n\u201cI remember Tobias when he made a mistake in front of all of us,\u201d Cyrus said to Thorpe, \u201cI left him then, thinking him old, and, worse, over. What am I talking about?\u201d\n\u201cNothing, sir, you was just askin\u2019 if the timbers were blackened and none are so no worry.\u201d\n\u201cRight. Thank you, Thorpe.\u201d\nCyrus then undid the buttons again, noting how most of his vest\u2019s velvet filigree had long gone into the way of leathered smudge.\n\u201cCy, find your head. Look at them, the apes you\u2019ve made that love you. Now, look at that beast that follows, its crew o\u2019 wrong-eyed alien murderthirst that we\u2019ll never understand.\u201d\nCyrus looked up, tongued the tooth that was still since he and Borden disagreed on this journey and its end heist. \u201cNord had knuckles, I\u2019ll give him that,\u201d he said.\nThorpe tossed his sponge and Cyrus caught it without thinking. The scrub was angry. \u201cLookee now, I remember Tobias, too, but which set of knuckles are ye talkin\u2019 yer teeth about here?\u201d\n\u201cMy whole life is a fight--\u201d\n\u201cSome of them didn\u2019t stay, some of \u2018em looked on ya like ye were gone too mad, but yet-so get over it. If ye start to forget why we\u2019re here, beatin\u2019 mast to make the moon, we\u2019ll shipwreck on a whim of yours made under blue an\u2019 proper skies.\u201d\nAll right, people, some of them didn\u2019t stay. It\u2019s &lt;a href=\"Morrowind\"&gt;Morrowind&lt;/a&gt;, after all. But eyes to the sand. Look. Best as I can make, this is their layout. It\u2019s a bug-camp, though, so expect it to be wrong when we get in. Timbalt, you and your boys are shoot duty. Itu, Naddock, Mal, Thorpe? You\u2019re with me. Frigar, you\u2019re watching those hornet-riders; memorize their patterns if they got one, shout \u2018em down if you figure we\u2019re in there fighting, it\u2019ll be obvious. Cyrus, the cats are held captive here, here, there, and most likely there, too. They look thin, but they\u2019re jits, so they\u2019ll come out fighting if this all comes to trouble. And that would be a mistake.\n\u201cI\u2019m sorry, Thorpe, you mistake me. We\u2019re not being chased like you think. I was trying to say--\u201d\n\u201cHell we\u2019re not, and now yer actin\u2019 nostalgic, an\u2019 getting\u2019 yer brawls past and present all mixed up. Making peace with your old captain is yer own lug-weight, Cy, and now\u2019s not really the proper clock.\u201d\n\u201cShut up, Thorpe, that\u2019s not you talking. It\u2019s this sail. And call it a whim one more time and I\u2019ll have you. Now watch if you won\u2019t listen. See our chaser\u2019s cannon all moved out and forward? They\u2019re about to fire and I haven\u2019t set to order our move to change course.\u201d\nI told you, Frigar had the hornets! Ach, look, cat, I appreciate the help but I\u2019ve got this. Cyrus, stop staring at the sky and look at me. At which point did you decide to change course? Change course? That hornet had you pinned. Is that your view from the top, now, laddie? I was staying my head down and waiting for our shooters. No, this was a fight and I just won it for you. When I\u2019m down, you get to make that call. Looked plenty down to me. That jaw just won\u2019t stop now, will it? We\u2019ll collect our drake and be done with it. I\u2019m through protecting you. You never did, Tobias. You just had the boat and a face I remembered.\nCyrus looked to Thorpe. \u201cWait for it.\u201d\nAnd the cricket-click went: \u201cSunbeam charge reroute to main engine move to intercept the remains of our prey they are glass\u2019d for cannon fire what was that eruption report\u201d\nThe Carrickers hit the deck when the SMIS Longbow exploded, a small warp of the Lords of Misrule clamoring for the creatia they might claim for their own. Daedric servitorslips blinked into view around the Alinor Sunbird\u2019s last moment. A small Oblivion war happened in the space that was not.\nCyrus looked at Thorpe, who was on the floor in brave panic. \u201cThere. Is everyone\u2019s head on straight yet? Should be, because look at that.\u201d\nA massive shape moved across the silver disc of Masser on the fore. Gar started to shake some magic from his hands, but Fornower put them down. \u201cIt won\u2019t help. That\u2019s the Imperials.\u201d\nCyrus heard this from high up and nodded. \u201cYes,\u201d he called to the crew. \u201cYes, it is. Now I\u2019ve only seen these on blueprints and in books, but it\u2019s one of their void-castles. It\u2019s them that fired. That\u2019s why we\u2019re still sailing. Stay good.\u201d\nThorpe, eyeing the shape, a collection of towers on upturned crag of rock, immense in its entire, red loops shining like earrings along its flanks, cooling from the blast they sent towards the Altmer \u2018bird, and said, \u201cA Battlespire. Godsblood, Cy, I see now why Borden set to knock you on yer head.\u201d\nCyrus was smiling. \u201cBorden was short-sighted. So are you. The prize we seek is just behind that beast, on those lunar breaks you can make out just there. See?\u201d\n\u201cYou just started a war, dummy. That\u2019s all I see.\u201d\n\u201cNo, I just made sure the elves chased us too far. There\u2019s a treaty out here on the edge of nothing between men and mer, just like back home. The Carrick, she\u2019s a Wayrest boat, easy on their eyes and less threatening to boot. We were just the bait. And now we switched.\u201d\nThorpe made a sound through his lips. \u201cWe\u2019ve got bleedin\u2019 sload bumps for gas and a sphere o\u2019 anti-madness that\u2019s barely held, cap. What exactly did we switch up to?\u201d\n\u201cOffense.\u201d\nTo Provisional Governor of &lt;a href=\"the%20Reach\"&gt;the Reach&lt;/a&gt;, Contested &lt;a href=\"High%20Rock\"&gt;High Rock&lt;/a&gt;, Titus Alorius, Knight-Commander of the Estates, Duke of Esteem in unified &lt;a href=\"Colovia\"&gt;Colovia&lt;/a&gt;, Blade-Seneschal of the Emperor &lt;a href=\"Tiber%20Septim\"&gt;Tiber Septim&lt;/a&gt;, etc., etc., etc.\nWhereas the Master of the TEM Battlespire Honor Before Glory, Celeus Fallbright, Knight-Commander of the Ruby Armada, Admiral of the Dragon Banner at Void and Commander in Chief of His Majesty's Ships and Vessels employed and to be employed in the Lanes Aetherial &amp; Mnemolic, etc., etc., etc.,\n--is now dead without recourse to doctrined revivication, set out by the Elder Council, the Congress of the Eight, and the Chamberlains of the College of Imperial Magic--\nYou are now appointed as the new commander of the TEM Battlespire Utmost Triumph to secure in irons real and unreal, the vagrant Redguard terror Sura-do-Hega, 'Cyrus' in the Cyrodilic, 'The Maverick King of the &lt;a href=\"Alik%27r\"&gt;Alk'r&lt;/a&gt;' in quarters vulgar, base, and tavern-fanciful--\n--and all hands of his vessel the Carrick, for questioning by an appointed emissary of &lt;a href=\"White-Gold%20Tower\"&gt;White-Gold&lt;/a&gt;, and to do so without delay.\nBe advised, if reports are true, the Carrick and its captain have destroyed both the TEM Honor Before Glory and TEM Longbow, Sunbird of Alinor. While vox-enabled memospores seem to indicate that the TEM Longbow was taken unawares and easily bested, defeat of the TEM Honor Before Glory appears to have been the work of subterfuge. Proof-transmission follows:\nArchimandrite-at-Ready: \u201cHailing the captain of the vessel flying the Imga cape. We can\u2019t hear you. We see you cupping your hands. Please try to yell louder.\u201d\nCyrus: \u201cGet out of my way!\u201d\nArchimandrite-at-Ready: \u201cHalt and present yourselves for inspection. We apologize for the Altmeri transgression. This is friendly void.\u201d\nCyrus: \u201cLast chance!\u201d\nArchimandrite-at-Ready: \u201cLanes to Imperial Masser are closed to the citizenry. Turn back or we will fire upon you in majestic ways.\u201d\nCyrus (muffled): \u201cCoyle, pull her up and over eight degrees moon-by-moon-north. Haekele, cut the lashes and launch our slug. Thorpe? On my mark, full spin to stop, and drop cargo. This is why I paid a ransom in salt.\u201d\nVisuals can verify that the Carrick was somehow sailing via sload-clusters, barnacled to its sides, but this is common for Abecean liners at mundrial sea. What is most asuredly not common is a fully-grown specimen of Thras held by ropes beneath the beam, and launched like some ad-hoc torpedo.\nWith the application of salt, the crew initiated hitherto unforeseen peristaltic vibrations within said specimen, propelling it forwards and into a landing bay of the TEM Honor Before Glory. Considerable Thrassian flatulence resulted, sending the incapacitated vessel spiraling towards the side of the moon.\nIts impact into the Colony proper was ameliorated by orbital moth-mirage and screening flak, yet its bulk cratered itself nearby, no souls surviving.\nP-G Titus Alorius, report to the nearest &lt;a href=\"Weir%20Gate\"&gt;Weir Gate&lt;/a&gt;, show arms, take teleport, and make haste for Masser.\nGiven on board the TEM Warspore Tiberia,at aetherial anchor, 26th Last Seed, 3E____Praeceptor Superior Erramanwe\nFornower was in the ropes, using a trumpet from &lt;a href=\"Pyandonea\"&gt;Pyandonea&lt;/a&gt; to sound the moonfall.\n\u201cPrepare for landing! Everyone in their suits and everyone watching the others. If one of us can\u2019t remember how, another of us grabs their straps and buckles \u2018em tight. We\u2019re the Carrickers and none forget.\u201d\nDust washed across the eyelets of their helmets and the keel made a sound that Cyrus frowned at, but his ship set even well enough, its crew pushing the sloadbags down by pole-struts to serve as landing bladders. Haekele grabbed at the glimmerwelts that rose up, and the captain had no heart to tell him that these things were a compost of a sort and nothing to make one rich.\n\u201cOn my lead,\u201d Cyrus said, jumping over the side, \u201cI\u2019ve been here before.\u201d\nThose in the reaving party jumped, too, no nations now in their tatter-suits, leaping in arcs for the youngest or the wild, or careful hops into the silver dust for those between both, and all of them looking around through the eyelets of their helmets which were bulging out now with breath, like speckled, half-dumb tubers taking the measure, and fat-fingered gloves pointing up from the south towards the Imperial walls of the Colony.\nCyrus started running. Coyle hit beside him already at full gait, saying \u201cFor you, cap! For Hayle!\u201d before leaping again off a lip of a crater to disappear behind the small dust plume of his own making. The boy let go the flag-cape of the Imga which he had re-stolen just for this moment and it raised up to hang in the air and his shipmates saw the dare.\nAnd Chemli remembered her nation then, shouting, \u201cSPRINT!\u201d and blowing off the front of her helmet off with power. She panicked for a second, but Fornower landed beside her, his hair tangled in glimmerwelt (he couldn\u2019t figure out the pockets of his suit) and he had left his helmet long behind.\n\u201cIt\u2019s okay, we can breathe here! Just learn how!\u201d Evidently, for some, it was by licorice straw; Fornower was using one as a reed. His hair, what was left of it, it still was left, and she could imagine it combed, but stop thinking about that and run.\n\u201cQuit being stupid,\u201d Cyrus grunted, nearing the crater\u2019s edge.\n\u201cRight,\u201d barked a voice, which issued from the suit that was marked as Haekele\u2019s, and was prancing, \u201cHearken to your captain! Here be dragons! Let no Devil--\u201d\nA tuber floated slow, then hit the surface with certitude. Cyrus sheathed his saber, having none of the strain the others did with the tatter bulk. When Haekele\u2019s suit fell, it leaked gems. Then the scamp showed itself, its mouth sewn shut so that the voice just heard became a wonder, and Cyrus shook his head. An arrow found the scamp\u2019s eye, and Jill, one of the cautious, refolded her bone bow eighteen paces back.\n\u201cWhat was that, Sura?\u201d someone asked. Not many were running now.\nThe gems were Haekele\u2019s favorite prize from Cold Harbour. The scamp was just a letter sent by its master. Cyrus wouldn\u2019t take his helmet off to answer Jill. She just might see Borden in his eye. Hell, she might even see S\u2019rathra.\n\u201cWe\u2019re being chased,\u201d he said by way of explanation. \u201cEnemies front and behind now. Don\u2019t despair.\u201d\n\u201cThat\u2019s no answer, Cap.\u201d\n\u201cWhat did I miss?\u201d This yelled from Coyle, on the other edge of the crater, the Colony barely framed behind him, its description changing as the moths remade it according to some Imperial command.\n---Dumb to let him keep those, if you don\u2019t mind me saying. My boat, Borden, and they make him happy. Well, yeah, all shiny from the dwimmerdark makes ye happy, sir, but that\u2019s the point. Just tell the boy to sell \u2018em when next we make port. Let a merchant deal with, y\u2019know, Him. No. They\u2019re Haekele\u2019s spoils, and he won them fair. He won them fair from &lt;a href=\"Molag%20Bal\"&gt;Molag Bal&lt;/a&gt;! Shh. They can hear their names, Borden. Wait, yer lettin\u2019 on to him that this is a raga thing, aren\u2019t you? No. Not really. But you are! You are! And what a raga wins, a raga deals with, am I right? Just... just grab the maps, Borden, and plan with me the job. Hell no, yer makin\u2019 us all bait! I\u2019ll have none for it! Put the sword down and get serious. Not a chance. Put. The. Sword. Everybody get down here, they\u2019re killing each other!\n---\u201cWhat would you do with it, if you had it?\u201d\n\u201cWhat you won\u2019t.\u201d\n\u201cThat\u2019s too broad a view, Cyrus. And it smacks of desperation.\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019m chained to a wall. Thought the tone might fit.\u201d\n\u201cAh, then tones it is. Hear mine: WULDVOKEIN!\u201d\n\u201cStop.\u201d\n\u201cHOON!\u201d\n\u201cQuit... talking in hurricane.\u201d\n\u201cYour ears are bleeding. And I swore to us both no torture. You\u2019ve made me change my mind. I do that.\u201d\n\u201cHow long did Tobias last against this?\u201d\n\u201cI am the future, Redguard. And you\u2019re still blaming me for it.\u201d\n\u201cYeah, well, probably. I do that. But you\u2019re forgetting something. You always do.\u201d\n\u201cAnd what would that be? I really am listening.\u201d\n\u201cYour past. Our past. You shout so far forward that your own history has to be rewritten.\u201d\n\u201cIn my mind, this conversation wasn\u2019t so tiresome. In the end, you are nothing more than a terrorist. I should not have to walk you through your dead. Your ransack of the Colossus Halls. The whole of the Renewed All Flags Navy in the Set only three years past. The mock-duel with your wife that ended the Rift and gave her a grave of snow. Proud yet? Pride is something I can admire and have done, but I don\u2019t let boys paint it for me and then run under guns they don\u2019t understand.\u201d\n\u201cKeep talking. It works. They said it would. Was hoping it did.\u201d\n\u201cDragging the Lame Cat of &lt;a href=\"Wayrest\"&gt;Wayrest&lt;/a&gt; to the docks while he was still on fire, one of your own make when you found he had finally sold your name? \u2018Come at the Alik\u2019r, you best not miss, boys.\u2019 Those were your words, then, yes?\u201d\n\u201cMore or less. Yeah.\u201d\nThere was a shiver, from one the veterans. Cyrus shifted, making the chains clank to cover more noise, and glanced sideways. I swore I taught them better. They\u2019d kept hidden in the three-flu marshes for days, and with less threat than now. Remember your cover, people, or he shouts for real. The Emperor kept to his admonishments, though, and gave no glance.\n\u201cAnd the Hist now twice shamed, though I suppose I should thank you for that, at least. The one version of this place where you did cut the atomos to make my friend look foolish? You don\u2019t even remember that because I had to make it right again. I am tired of always standing against breakers of worlds with a grudge to fulfill. You are not a myth. You are not a story.\u201d\n\u201cTrue. And that\u2019s what needs a good rewrite. Everyone ready? Go.\u201d\nThe chains fell. Cyrus caught his saber with his left hand. Jill\u2019s stomach made a sound; she\u2019d been eating the dead again as in the way of the Green-Sap. Those Carrickers that had survived, they had the Emperor already in ropes and gagged with glimmerwelt. Fornower shook the rest of the compost from his hair. Tiber Septim remained stoic.\nThorpe, straightened to a tallness he hadn\u2019t possessed since Tear, and said, \u201cFine, so it worked.\u201d\nGar was saying, \u201cWho always appears as a great bearded king, had powers innumerable and echoing.\u201d\nJill said, \u201cWhat now? Mind if I find His Majesty\u2019s other throne? Swallowed a jaw, I think.\u201d\nCyrus tongued his tooth again. \u201cGo ahead, there\u2019s no one else here. Just stop eating everyone. Give us some room.\u201d\nThe Carrickers moved back, and Cyrus sabered the ropes. He let its edge linger a bit too long on the Emperor\u2019s left eye. It had always been a good sword, this one.\n\u201cCy, stop,\u201d Thorpe reminded him. \u201cFair fight or we don\u2019t win.\u201d\n\u201cWinning is relative.\u201d\n\u201cWhen did you decide to change course, Cy, am I right? No more time for that. Here, boy, hand it over.\u201d\n\u201cNo more time. Take it.\u201d\n\u201cGood, thanks. Now everyone get a bit better back.\u201d\n\u201cWhat, no one\u2019s gonna mention that, for once, his mouth is actually full of--\u201d\nGar was saying, \u201cHe was grim and dark and the most silent of the invading chieftains, though when he spoke villages were uplifted and thrown into the sea.\u201d\n\u201cFornower, we get the joke. Go ahead and spit, Tiber, we\u2019re almost done.\u201d The Emperor coughed the compost from his mouth. Three windows were blasted into the courtyard as he rose. Someone heard a thunderclap just before Cyrus elbowed him in the throat.\nGar was saying, \u201cThe &lt;a href=\"HoonDing\"&gt;Hoon Ding&lt;/a&gt; fought him unarmed, grabbing the Dragon's roars by hand until Ysmir's power throat bled.\u201d\n\u201cNo more time,\u201d he said again. \u201cFight\u2019s on. And quit calling me that.\u201d\nGar was saying, \u201cThese roars were given to Gar to bind into an ebony listening frame, which the warrior-poet placed on Ysmir's face and ears to drive him mad and drive him away.\u201d\nChemli said, \u201cListening frame. Did we forget that bit?\u201d\nGar put his book away and took Haekele\u2019s helmet out, tossing it to the captain.\n\u201cNope. We\u2019re the Carrickers and none forget.\u201d\n---You\u2019re letting him actually beat you. I have a bag around my head with your enchantments still swirling about, Bal. No, I get that, but I mean he\u2019s actually beating on you while you\u2019re talking to me. I\u2019m wearing the Word, it doesn\u2019t hurt all that much, but I need you out of my eyes, you already have the boy. I had the boy the moment the Sura-Hoon made his bargain. You have nothing to really offer, until you do. Until I do. Until you do. You took his shape? Yes. And you did nothing but make a joke? Slow day. He\u2019s not big time like you are. Granted, he\u2019s whipping you across the jail bars, case you didn\u2019t notice. What do you want? Doesn\u2019t work that way. I always want. I\u2019ll give you ten years under my name, but not this skin. Deal. That skin is looking pretty haggard, anyway. Now get up and fight, dummy, we\u2019re all counting on you. Thank you, Bal, I won\u2019t forget this.\n---Tiber Septim looked to Cyrus. \u201cReady now, Redguard.\u201d\n---Bounding towards the Colony, in that mad rush he can name now if he would let himself:\n\u201cYou know, cap, this\u2019ll sound funny, but I could swear this crater looks fresher than the rest.\u201d\n\u201cYou\u2019re a sailor, Coyle, and as far as they go you were always pretty level-headed. Don\u2019t go superstitious on me now. Everything here is dead. Nothing fresh ab--\u201d\nThe ground tore open before them. A wave of pressurized phlogiston washed over the reaver party, making the air crackle with potential it hadn\u2019t known in ages.\n\u201cGunnery fire!\u201d\nPretty soon there was no space between the rounds. Sky and floor were the same thing: a bloomfire spread of insect wings and math-flak. \u201cIncoming numer-nomials now!\u201d Gar warned.\n\u201cCHEMLI YOU HAD ORDERS!\u201d Cyrus roared, looking for her through possipoints. He had to blink between blinks to get rid of the snapshots.\nChemli was already shouting the warheads down from the firmament whenever she could. The crew couldn\u2019t hear her above the clamor, and every new shelling took a different shape. She almost fell to another sleeved-manticore scream-angling in on some kind of delight-death trajectory with names of its summoners written in cursive. Chemli thought, it\u2019s getting personal to them, and sprint-shouted blind, caught by her captain.\n\u201cGood girl,\u201d Cyrus said, nodding, \u201cYou\u2019re good now.\u201d Good crew. Stupid, but good. Trench warfare. Been awhile. \u201cRegroup!\u201d\nThorpe landed. \u201cMORE SHELLING, MOVE \u2018EM TO A CRATER.\u201d\n\u201cWhat happened?\u201d From Chemli, taking the scrub\u2019s shoulder.\n\u201cIt\u2019s just him being loud,\u201d Cyrus said, sliding down the crater\u2019s rim. \u201cThe Emperor. He\u2019s scared. He can't bend this place to his will. Death doesn\u2019t work right here. Coyle, how is everyone doing?\u201d\n\u201cAll heads counted, cap, and the Imps, they\u2019re finally reloading. Get a breath and start moving again.\u201d\n\u201cGood plan, but where are you?\u201d\nGar pointed to Coyle\u2019s suit up on the further rim above them. It had no midsection.\n\u201cDon\u2019t go superstitious on me now,\u201d Coyle said.\n\u201cIf he talks again, burn him.\u201d Please stay quiet, Coyle. Just this once.\nThey climbed past the body and moved north.\n---All right, people, some of them didn\u2019t stay. It\u2019s Masser, after all. But eyes to the dust. Look. Best as I can make, this is their layout. It\u2019s an Imperial Reclaim, though, so expect it to be wrong when we get in. Jill, you\u2019re the only shooter we really have, do the boat proud like. Coyle, Fornower, Gar? You\u2019re with me. Chemli, you\u2019re watching those gun batteries; memorize their patterns if they got one, shout \u2018em down as we charge. Thorpe, the Emperor is either here, here, there, and or even there, even if that altitude makes no sense. He looks good on the drake, and the stories are true, so he\u2019ll come out fighting if this all comes to trouble. And that\u2019s no mistake.\n---Scene: The Womb of the TEM Warspore Tiberia, 30th Last Seed, 3E____ . P-G Titus Alorius, recently ported from Weir Gate fv.4.5, addresses the Morb\u00e2d Obesse as they study gel screens held aloft by red silk ribbons. Praeceptor Superior Erramanwe remains silent in sleep throughout the proceedings.\nTitus Alorius: No fully supplied ground stations, you say?\nThe Morb\u00e2d Obesse: One way to put it.\nTitus Alorius: Put it another way.\nThe Morb\u00e2d Obesse: Well, as far as numbers 'n' statistics go, we're looking at the set of halfway functional Imperial garrisons on that big rock and the set of things that absolutely don't exist. You'll find the two have quite the overlap.\nTitus Alorius: Improvise then. Optimize troop distribution. Set course for the surface and drain all available hands from this vessel. Cover as much... ground as possible with as few 'nauts as possible. I don't know where this rover could be headed, but we will make sure he doesn't get there\nThe Morb\u00e2d Obesse: Eh, listen, son. Sir. I don't think you understand. See that little dot down there? Or up there, who knows. That is the Imperial Reclaim of The Greater whatever they call it these days. That is our turf. We got one docking station and the good fortune none of it seems to rust. Seven men, sir. Seven men. Hrolbedamned, we still send the relief in some threadbare hiatopod. There's no provisions for 'spores this size to touch ground there. In one piece, anyway.\nTitus Alorius: Poor humor. Still, I'll grant, the logistic status of the Demalion is not exactly as advanced as I was led to believe. I did not expect this.\nThe Morb\u00e2d Obesse: Think I'd have come if I had been properly informed? You'll understand I'm a bit out of the loop here, but allow me to do some guesswork. Postulate one: name's Alorius, right? Big name. Moving up in the world, no doubt. Postulate two: You've been posted about as far from fair Niben as they could throw you, with a big situation on your hands to boot. Ergo: You were in someone's way. Who put your name in? Was it Cormades? All those years and that ruthless bastard is still playing chess with the Empire's finest? It was Cormades, wasn't it?\nTitus Alorius: Enough. You are speaking far above your station. I have been thinking. What you are saying does not make sense. The crown nigh emptied the coffers of reunited Cyrodiil to reclaim our holdings here. The pinnacle of the orbital fleet patrols this sector, until recently with unerring efficiency. Why would the Emperor apply all these resources to a domain he shows no interest in?\nThe Morb\u00e2d Obesse: Now you're asking a different question. The Empire has little relevance here. Doesn't have the means to. But the Emperor, well, I think he is rather fond of the place. On a personal sort of level, I mean. As if it's more his than ours. The boys at the station, they joke they see him out there sometimes, you know. Just out and about, strolling. That's the drink talking, of course. That, and staring into the dark too long. The big black puts funny ideas in a man's head. Take no notice.\nTitus Alorius: I didn't. Regardless of Septim's opinion of this province, I will have this gaffe dealt with, Cormades be damned. If our own troops do not suffice, then we find help elsewhere. I have been given a lavish budget to stop Sura-hoon and I will not hesitate to use it. Bend time and get to a possipoint close enough to when it happened. Send out a message on all aetherial frequencies, even the deprecated ones. Someone will listen; everything can be negotiated. If you catch a void-fibril, tell the Hist Cyrus is on the loose again. They don't need more convincing. If some cat floats by, tell them we can make their sugar invisible in return for a favor to the Empire. Establish a corridor to Misrule if you must, but mind who you're dealing with. Report to me. Dismissed.\nHist super-liner slip seed stalkstrum builtgrown wash branched out in snapthorn belly bass crawler phloematic thornplex virsliclk-ix-that\u2019ls its thatls riggered out scale calyx critical sepals critical corolla critical stemens engage floodbogmud lignicore pasted drowned thing. It made a sound.\n\u201cThat what I think it is?\u201d Jill asked, looking up at it, sitting eastward watch between them and the last lunar break to the Colony proper.\n\u201cMost like,\u201d Thorpe said. The scrub had been there, had held the Eye for a week as they ran through the stone-stalks, lathered from the flu in skooma.\nCyrus stared. \u201cI think so. But we were all out of our minds then, though. Can\u2019t be them. They never leave the Marsh.\u201d\n\u201cLots of running with you lot,\u201d Chemli said. Her voice was sore.\nThorpe was showing signs of fibril now, throwing off a glove and seeing the roots take twine.\n\u201cOutta our minds just about now, boss. It\u2019s them. Give the word and we\u2019ll shake this all.\u201d\n\u201cNot yet.\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019m sproutin\u2019 flowers here, make it soon.\u201d\nFornower was glad now he had his glimmerwelt. \u201cI\u2019m fine. Lizards don\u2019t seem to want to lace around my head at all. Now who\u2019s laughing?\u201d\nWhy aren\u2019t we remembering our dead, Chemli wondered, and then petals. \u201cPetals,\u201d she said.\n\u201cIt\u2019s all in our heads,\u201d Cyrus said. \u201cStay good.\u201d\n\u201cOh,\u201d Thorpe smirked, licking a mushroom knuckle, \u201cForgot about that. Treaties and all. The Hist just broke it, right? Easy enough. Petals.\u201d\nThey were losing it. Commands were needed.\n\u201cYou\u2019re losing it, Thorpe,\u201d Cyrus said, \u201cTrees aren\u2019t dumb enough to fall into a sunbird\u2019s wake sitting on the edge of the Accord. Unless.\u201d\n\u201cUnless there\u2019s no more Accord,\u201d Gar finished. \u201cYessir, look, the stars are moving, meaning the constellations went wet again.\u201d\nCyrus started jogging towards the Colony, westward in berth, hoping the others would know best to follow. They did, Thorpe trailing a visible lily scent.\n\u201cWent wet? How do you mean?\u201d Jill asked. She ran fast even as she studied the new plant life above her.\n\u201cSorry, I forget you\u2019re young to the Carrick. By \u2018wet\u2019 I mean they slid off our maps. Only the Emperor can do that, change which stars mean what. What it really means is that the birth signs are even getting out the way.\u201d\n\u201cPetals.\u201d\n\u201cYeah, that\u2019s the short version.\u201d\nDuadeen wondered if the pirate could give any kind of version at all now. Every time the Emperor shouted, things went violent and awkward. One shout after another. Even the snow looked a different color, gone a bit brown from the dirt stirred up underneath, or the sweat which all of them contributed to, the animals as well, as the horses had never liked it, this shouting and those Imperial aurochs, snorting their bellows-hearted move to go, but all including the moons made to look by the red diamond men and small militia, even Duadeen\u2019s own small contribution, professional scofflaws and hard men of worth; their retainers were exceeding high to the robber-baron of the Way Rest, but probably nothing in contrast, not even worth a spoken well-done, to this new and two-headed crown in at least many ways reborn. I have no idea what this person naming himself the Septim is anymore, Duadeen thought. All my records were roach in their wrong.\nHe was not stupid, Duadeen. No one this far west could be to get this ahead. He had gambled with gold and bought a gelding enchanted for this night, the catching night, where Tobias Hold-None would be riding with a small but fierce bodyguard that Duadeen had already studied and found battle faults for weakness to the Emperor\u2019s ease; this horse, which had on its ledger a fancy name, and the promissory note that read it would know no fear in violence. It wasn\u2019t a lie, it was just facing, like him, a new, small frantic now with the frame of night gone a bit pink from all the blood. Or maybe it was just the echo in everything\u2019s ears, thundercracked by thoom.\nHe said he wouldn\u2019t resort to this, Duadeen would never remember later. Grammar itself was turning into a landslide.\nIt was a strange color now, the floor of the earth under this corner of the world, under these trees in the woods of New Falkreath, a mixed color ones of station had only ever seen in the pigments of the more modern painters of Tamriel, proud in their new Era, a real color, they proposed, one that\u2019s antique but avoided for perhaps it was too easy not to think about how hard: the true color of men when they are determined to uncover mysteries at any cost.\n\u201cCaptain Tobias,\u201d the Emperor said, sitting his bat-horse on a branch of oak jutting from a nearby hill. \u201cI pray thee stop again, this unwillingness on your part, this bleak and farrow insolence. I call you Nord now whatever your mixed ancestry, for I have as like. I call you a man, too, because I\u2019ve seen so little of them. Don\u2019t make me shout again. Not in front of these others.\u201d\nWhen did I think meat-eating bulls would be part of my resume, Duadeen asked himself. No one could ever answer that.\n\u201cHey right, I\u2019ll do that,\u201d the pirate said, crawling to lean with his back turned on a mound of what might be horse meat and toppled tree, with roared metal broken and thrown by voice into shards into all of it. The ambush had been a terrible thing and so utterly sudden that it was hard to remember that all of this had once been a normal woodside pass because it stank now. It stank of gods when as boys, stank of the idea of gangs. Was the tilt of the crown really so endangered as this?\n\u201cI\u2019ll do just that once I catch my breath.\u201d\n\u201cI need to catch mine, too,\u201d the Emperor said. There were legionnaires that sighed then, Duadeen knowing them each now to have been hand-picked from times in battle where they had already seen the likes as this. Which must mean they knew how these things went. And by sighing, it was clear enough that they were never still with it in heart. No one moves through such a landscape without hoping never to do again.\nThe pirate put his knees up, using a helmet to prop his broken one, yelling pain with the effort, a caught proud creature against ruin, a caught proud creature knowing ash was come. Like most in these moments, he laughed after yelling, but sunk his head to his chest. \u201cI hate him, too, milord Hjalti,\u201d he snorted, \u201cBut you fear him. He would\u2019ve liked that. He will like that. No, no, no.\u201d:\n\u201cHe\u2019s gone ill-brained,\u201d Duadeen said, glancing at the bat. \u201cI can purchase us another way. I will use my own gold.\u201d\nThe Emperor looked over and frowned. \u201cOne\u2019s illusions are usually more discreet.\u201d Tiber Septim dismounted but no one saw. The next moment he was simply crawling up in the new, cold colors to his prey, a strange beast movement now, and an auroch ate a man. \u201cIt\u2019s simple to step aside all of that. Just don\u2019t have any illusions. We don\u2019t, do we, Captain Tobias?\u201d\nThe pirate took his face from his knees and looked, lips and eyes gone mongrel, his lower left jaw just showing bone and burnt, black attachments. \u201cNo, no,\u201d Tobias\u2019 skull tried to say, forcing it finally out, \u201cNo. He won\u2019t like it one godsbitten bit, and your monster thought revels in this already. You\u2019re just making us all words to him, you\u2019re thinking. You\u2019ve gone different now, milord, you\u2019ve gone proper insane.\u201d\nThe Emperor was gutting him with a broken but serviceable dagger, up, left, and to the sternum, but the pirate still talked. \u201cProper insane in proper redwork. You\u2019ve gone Hircine. You\u2019ve gone and got my belly out. You\u2019ve gone and kept me alive through this all with that devil\u2019s wind of yours in my own lungs, just to anger him.\u201d\n\u201cYes. I prayed you to stop. You wouldn\u2019t. Now I\u2019m working.\u201d\n\u201cHe set the cat on fire, milord. He was telling you right then that he doesn\u2019t fear you. I\u2019ve hated that bit of him, the cocksure until it kills the rest. But look who\u2019s winning now? Who\u2019s so cocksure that they\u2019re bent like a hagraven at a beggar\u2019s last delight?\u201d\nThe Emperor stopped the talking, stabbing up until the pirate\u2019s whole dead half-skull was his on a hilt. Duadeen vomited when he saw Septim continue the conversation in two voices.\n\u201cYou\u2019ve won this one,\u201d the Emperor said as himself.\n\u201cI\u2019m a puppet head,\u201d the Emperor said in the imitation of the dead pirate\u2019s voice.\n\u201cI\u2019m a puppeteer.\u201d\n\u201cYou move my head back and forth on this metal stick and talk to yourself as someone you remember.\u201d\n\u201cLook, I can make you nod with your own head. You\u2019re starting to rot too fast.\u201d\nIt was the giggling that made most everyone perish. Torches dropped as the legionnaires stopped in their lives. Snow if it could be called that pounded up when horses hit. The aurochs belched out all of their eating and their gorge made pea-green steam of the world around, buckling down in death, while the Emperor on all fours except for his right hand holding up the pirate\u2019s head to his own giggling out some theatrics that made sense to him alone, saying, \u201cI\u2019ll leave you in ash, sweet Captain, and they\u2019re all dead now save for us.\u201d\nTiber Septim stood up, dropping everything he held. Tobias\u2019 head fell back to his chest, propped up now for a slight by the dagger hilt before lolling to this way and that, for all the mad moving to and fro had broken all his neck bones.\n\u201cIt looks now like you\u2019ve had a right good fight, maybe even near the victor, as it\u2019s only me now that escaped, an ambush that went nearly wrong, and again my enemies will think me possible to take down, if dangerous to try. And that\u2019s how I will win.\u201d\nThe Emperor shouted and the whole of the wood forgot what was said."}

The Wars started in &lt;a href=\"2E%20854\"&gt;2E 854&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"2E%20855\"&gt;2E 855&lt;/a&gt; and lasted for 42 years, with the end of the Tiber Wars marking the start of &lt;a href=\"Third%20Era\"&gt;Third Era&lt;/a&gt; and Tamriel standing united under the &lt;a href=\"Imperial\"&gt;Imperial&lt;/a&gt; banner.\nBackground.\nThe Tiber Wars were inspired when the &lt;a href=\"Greybeards\"&gt;Greybeards&lt;/a&gt; told &lt;a href=\"Tiber%20Septim\"&gt;Tiber Septim&lt;/a&gt; that he was destined to become the Emperor of Tamriel. After the death of &lt;a href=\"Cuhlecain\"&gt;Cuhlecain&lt;/a&gt;, Tiber Septim took his role, and started his conquest of Tamriel in the &lt;a href=\"2E%20855\"&gt;855th year of the Second Era&lt;/a&gt; or in the &lt;a href=\"2E%20854\"&gt;854th year of the Second Era&lt;/a&gt;. Tiber himself, however, found the initial administration of a fully united &lt;a href=\"Cyrodiil\"&gt;Cyrodiil&lt;/a&gt; a time-consuming task, and, because of this, &lt;a href=\"the%20Underking\"&gt;the Underking&lt;/a&gt; dealt with the Imperial expansion into Skyrim and High Rock.\nCampaigns.\nHuman kingdoms.\nSkyrim.\nDespite &lt;a href=\"Skyrim\"&gt;Skyrim's&lt;/a&gt; armies swearing loyalty to Tiber Septim after their defeat at &lt;a href=\"Sancre%20Tor\"&gt;Sancre Tor&lt;/a&gt;, Skyrim itself had not joined the Empire during Cuhlecain's rule. Tiber Septim invaded Skyrim with his Legions, one of his commanders was known as &lt;a href=\"Beatia%20of%20Ylliolos\"&gt;Beatia of Ylliolos&lt;/a&gt;, and had been ambushed by the &lt;a href=\"Nords\"&gt;Nords&lt;/a&gt; after a meeting with the &lt;a href=\"Emperor\"&gt;Emperor&lt;/a&gt;. The exact date as to when Skyrim fell to the Empire is unknown, but it is known that it was prior to &lt;a href=\"2E%20864\"&gt;2E 864&lt;/a&gt;. Compared to the conquest of Hammerfell, Skyrim's occupation was done with relatively little bloodshed. The Kings of Skyrim had outlasted Empires before, and expected this one to be no different. In contrast to its rulers, the Legion managed to persuade many of the young locals living in mountain villages to abandon their life and sign on with the Imperial army on promises of wealth and glory.\nHigh Rock.\n&lt;a href=\"High%20Rock\"&gt;High Rock&lt;/a&gt; had lived on pretty well after the fall of the &lt;a href=\"Reman%20Empire\"&gt;Reman Empire&lt;/a&gt;, but due to it existing of multiple kingdoms, it was easily conqeured by Tiber's armies. The official date on which High Rock was conquered by the Empire is also unknown, though it was before 2E 864, by which point the Bretons were considered to be \"solidified\" by the Empire. The Emperor's governor in High Rock, &lt;a href=\"Titus%20Alorius\"&gt;Titus Alorius&lt;/a&gt;, was liked by the Breton population, as Alorius ended the feuding between the Bretons kings with tact and skill.\nHammerfell.\n&lt;a href=\"Hammerfell\"&gt;Hammerfell&lt;/a&gt; was the last of the human kingdoms to fall to the Empire. Hammerfell's &lt;a href=\"High%20King\"&gt;High King&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Thassad%20II\"&gt;Thassad II&lt;/a&gt;, the leader of &lt;a href=\"the%20Crowns\"&gt;the Crowns&lt;/a&gt;, signed a truce with the &lt;a href=\"Forebear\"&gt;Forebear&lt;/a&gt; leader &lt;a href=\"Baron%20Volag\"&gt;Baron Volag&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"2E%20854\"&gt;2E 854&lt;/a&gt;. Done in response to the growing tensions between the province and the Empire, the treaty sought to strengthen Hammerfell's defenses and armies so that Septim would not invade the province. Over time, the relations between the Crowns and Forebears would deteriorate, and with the death of &lt;a href=\"High%20King\"&gt;High King&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Thassad%20II\"&gt;Thassad II&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"2E%20862\"&gt;2E 862&lt;/a&gt;, Hammerfell had been plunged into a &lt;a href=\"Hammerfell%20Civil%20War\"&gt;civil war&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe civil war was fought between the major political factions of Hammerfell: &lt;a href=\"the%20Crowns\"&gt;the Crowns&lt;/a&gt;, led by Thassad's son &lt;a href=\"A%27Tor\"&gt;A'Tor&lt;/a&gt;, and the &lt;a href=\"Forebears\"&gt;Forebears&lt;/a&gt;, led by &lt;a href=\"Sentinel\"&gt;Sentinel&lt;/a&gt; ruler Baron Volag. When the civil war was slowly being won by the Crowns, the desperate Forebears signed a pact with Septim, allowing his armies to march into Hammerfell, crush the Crowns, and claim Hammerfell as part of the Empire. The Imperials conqeured Hammerfell with ease, though began to treat the province as their own property, causing Volag to disappear from Sentinel.\nThe fateful &lt;a href=\"Battle%20of%20Hunding%20Bay\"&gt;Battle of Hunding Bay&lt;/a&gt; at &lt;a href=\"Stros%20M%27kai\"&gt;Stros M'kai&lt;/a&gt; was the only event where the Crown forces matched the might of the Empire, resulting in &lt;a href=\"New%20West%20Navy\"&gt;New West Navy&lt;/a&gt; Commander &lt;a href=\"Amiel%20Richton\"&gt;Amiel Richton&lt;/a&gt; to send &lt;a href=\"Nafalilargus\"&gt;Nafalilargus&lt;/a&gt; to obliterate the Crown forces during the battle, killing Prince &lt;a href=\"A%27Tor\"&gt;A'Tor&lt;/a&gt; in the process. After the Imperial victory there, Richton became provisional governor of Stros M'Kai. The Redguard deity &lt;a href=\"HoonDing\"&gt;HoonDing&lt;/a&gt; arrived in the form of &lt;a href=\"Cyrus%20%28Redguard%29\"&gt;Cyrus&lt;/a&gt;, a Redguard mercenary, and the &lt;a href=\"Soul%20Sword\"&gt;Soul Sword&lt;/a&gt;, an artifact imbued with A'Tor's life force. Under Cyrus' and &lt;a href=\"Restless%20League\"&gt;Restless League&lt;/a&gt; leader &lt;a href=\"Basil%20%28Character%29\"&gt;Basil&lt;/a&gt;'s guidance, a successful rebellion was launched on &lt;a href=\"Stros%20M%27kai\"&gt;Stros M'kai&lt;/a&gt;, overthrowing Richton's government. Another rebellion followed in &lt;a href=\"Sentinel\"&gt;Sentinel&lt;/a&gt;, led by the forces of Baron Volag. As a result of the rebellions, Tiber Septim came to Stros M'kai and negotiated the terms of the &lt;a href=\"Treaty%20of%20Stros%20M%27kai\"&gt;Treaty of Stros M'kai&lt;/a&gt; with the rebel leader of Stros M'kai, &lt;a href=\"Iszara\"&gt;Iszara&lt;/a&gt; and the rebel leader of Sentinel, Baron Volag.\nEastern Provinces.\nBlack Marsh.\nWhen the invasion of &lt;a href=\"Black%20Marsh\"&gt;Black Marsh&lt;/a&gt; occurred is not known, but it is known that there was fighting between the &lt;a href=\"Imperial%20Legion\"&gt;Legions&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Argonians\"&gt;Argonians&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"2E%20861\"&gt;2E 861&lt;/a&gt;, it is also known that Black Marsh fell prior to Hammerfell, though some sources state Black Marsh was yet to be conqeured when Hammerfell fell. However, it could be that Hammerfell wasn't recorded as \"fallen\" yet due to the rebellions in the land. It was said that Tiber Septim himself thought twice before conqeuring Black Marsh, the border regions fell easily to his Empire, but he wisely decided to avoid strategically unimportant inner swamps, and thus met with little resistance. Even under Imperial rule, the inner swamps were still controlled by the Argonians while the Empire controlled the coasts and borders of the province. Eventually, Black Marsh joined the Empire, mainly through a treaty.\nMorrowind.\n&lt;a href=\"Morrowind\"&gt;Morrowind&lt;/a&gt; became an Imperial province after Hammerfell had fallen. Initially, &lt;a href=\"Tribunal%20Temple\"&gt;the Temple&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Great%20Houses\"&gt;Great Houses&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"Redoran\"&gt;Redoran&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Dres\"&gt;Dres&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"House%20Indoril\"&gt;Indoril&lt;/a&gt; wanted to fight until the death, &lt;a href=\"Telvanni\"&gt;Telvanni&lt;/a&gt; remained neutral and &lt;a href=\"House%20Hlaalu\"&gt;House Hlaalu&lt;/a&gt; proposed accommodation. There were several battles between Morrowind and the Empire, one of which laid waste to &lt;a href=\"Mournhold\"&gt;Mournhold&lt;/a&gt;, now called &lt;a href=\"Almalexia%20%28City%29\"&gt;Almalexia&lt;/a&gt;. Other battles were fought on the border of Black Marsh and in western Morrowind, such as at &lt;a href=\"Silgrad%20Tower\"&gt;Silgrad Tower&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Kragenmoor\"&gt;Kragenmoor&lt;/a&gt;, and west of &lt;a href=\"Cormar%20View\"&gt;Cormar View&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Blacklight\"&gt;Blacklight&lt;/a&gt;. The situation changed, when &lt;a href=\"Vivec\"&gt;Vivec&lt;/a&gt; appeared and announced his negotiation of a treaty with the Emperor, which allowed the &lt;a href=\"Dunmer\"&gt;Dunmer&lt;/a&gt; to keep most of their traditions while joining the Empire. The Temple greeted the announcement with an awkward silence, Indoril and Dres still said they would resist to the death, while Redoran gladly took the opportunity to not have to fight the Legion unsupported. Redoran then switched sides, and backed House Hlaalu's proposal of accommodation. Telvanni, seeing which way the wind blew, joined Redoran and Hlaalu in their accommodation. Despite this, the &lt;a href=\"Lord%20High%20Councillor\"&gt;Lord High Councillor&lt;/a&gt; of Morrowind, an Indoril, refused the &lt;a href=\"Treaty%20of%20the%20Armistice\"&gt;treaty&lt;/a&gt; and refused to step down. Because of this, he was assassinated and replaced by a Hlaalu.\nSecond Aldmeri Dominion.\nValenwood and the Summerset Isles.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Thalmor\"&gt;Thalmor&lt;/a&gt; increased its hold on &lt;a href=\"Valenwood\"&gt;Valenwood&lt;/a&gt; during the founding of the Third Empire. Savage &lt;a href=\"Bosmer\"&gt;Bosmer&lt;/a&gt; tribes fought with the &lt;a href=\"Colovian%20Estates\"&gt;Estates&lt;/a&gt; along the &lt;a href=\"Strid%20River\"&gt;Strid River&lt;/a&gt;. However, when the Empire stood united these skirmishes stopped. After the attacks stopped both sides waited on either side of the Valenwood border for the decisive battle. On the occasions that the &lt;a href=\"Dominion\"&gt;Dominion&lt;/a&gt; probed the Empire's defenses, the Legion sent them back in tatters. The &lt;a href=\"Colovians\"&gt;Colovians&lt;/a&gt; even took to calling them the \"Old Mary Dominion\" due to the womanly offensives of its &lt;a href=\"Mer\"&gt;Elven&lt;/a&gt; soldiers. The situation at sea, however, was another story, as the Dominion terrorized the southern waters from the &lt;a href=\"Cape%20of%20the%20Blue%20Divide\"&gt;Cape of the Blue Divide&lt;/a&gt; to the &lt;a href=\"Topal%20Bay\"&gt;Topal Bay&lt;/a&gt;. Tiber Septim later used the &lt;a href=\"Numidium\"&gt;Numidium&lt;/a&gt; to conquer the Aldmeri Dominion.\nElsweyr.\nNot much is known about how &lt;a href=\"Elsweyr\"&gt;Elsweyr&lt;/a&gt; fared during the Tiber Wars, however, it is known, that Elsweyr had an agreement with the &lt;a href=\"Aldmeri%20Dominion\"&gt;Aldmeri Dominion&lt;/a&gt;, like the &lt;a href=\"Maormer\"&gt;Maormer&lt;/a&gt; and a few &lt;a href=\"Reachmen\"&gt;Reachmen&lt;/a&gt;. It is also known that the Third Legion sacked &lt;a href=\"Senchal\"&gt;Senchal&lt;/a&gt;, a city in the far south of Elsweyr, after they'd refused to surrender. Smuggling businesses ran from Elsweyr into the Empire, though they were later cracked down on after the Empire had strengthened their grip on the area.\nImperial force used.\nThe recorded Imperial forces during the Tiber Wars are as follows:"}

At HoonDing's Watch, the Vestige underwent trails that manifested into different points in &lt;a href=\"Redguard\"&gt;Redguard&lt;/a&gt; history such as the &lt;a href=\"Siege%20of%20Orsinium\"&gt;Siege of Orsinium&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Battle%20of%20Bangkorai%20Pass\"&gt;Battle of Bangkorai Pass&lt;/a&gt;.

The Legion marched towards &lt;a href=\"Satakalaam\"&gt;Satakalaam&lt;/a&gt; and took the city in a day. The &lt;a href=\"Sentinel\"&gt;Sentinel&lt;/a&gt; Army was stationed outside the southern gates and prepared to breach the inner city to defeat the Legion. The Vestige along with Prince Azah and &lt;a href=\"Talia%20at-Marimah\"&gt;Talia at-Marimah&lt;/a&gt; of the &lt;a href=\"Ash%27abah\"&gt;Ash'abah&lt;/a&gt; had arrived into town and aided the Alik'r Warriors in the battle. The Vestige was sent into the city to destroy the Legion from within and to find the man that brought them in the first place. It was revealed that &lt;a href=\"Magnifico%20Khorshad\"&gt;Magnifico Khorshad&lt;/a&gt; was the one responsible and he was put on trial in Sentinel. The Vestige continued to the Necropolis.\nResurrection of Suturah &amp; the Necropolis.\n&lt;a href=\"Shiri\"&gt;Shiri&lt;/a&gt; of the Withered Hand had resurrected an army of &lt;a href=\"Ra-Netu\"&gt;Ra-Netu&lt;/a&gt; from the Motalion Necropolis to defend her from the &lt;a href=\"Daggerfall%20Covenant\"&gt;Daggerfall Covenant&lt;/a&gt;. The Vestige advanced through the Necropolis and defeated a series of undead warriors and &lt;a href=\"Mummy\"&gt;Mummies&lt;/a&gt; to reach the inner sanctum where Shiri is keeping the third Ansei Ward. Shiri uses the ward to bring back her deceased father, &lt;a href=\"Suturah\"&gt;Suturah&lt;/a&gt;, former advisor of &lt;a href=\"King%20Fahara%27jad\"&gt;King Fahara'jad&lt;/a&gt;, the then King of Hammerfell. Suturah fled to Tigonus to join the &lt;a href=\"Order%20of%20the%20Black%20Worm\"&gt;Order of the Black Worm&lt;/a&gt; but was later killed for his secret practice of &lt;a href=\"Necromancy\"&gt;Necromancy&lt;/a&gt; and betrayal to the Court of Sentinel. He was buried in Motalion. The Vestige was able to defeat Shiri and Suturah and save the Alik'r Desert.\n&lt;a href=\"Third%20Era\"&gt;Third Era&lt;/a&gt;.\nTigonus in the Warp in the West.\nDuring the &lt;a href=\"Warp%20in%20the%20West\"&gt;Warp in the West&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"3E%20405\"&gt;3E 405&lt;/a&gt;, the Tigonus fiefdom was independent among the other 23 kingdoms in the Iliac Bay. The cities of &lt;a href=\"Kozanset\"&gt;Kozanset&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Satakalaam\"&gt;Satakalaam&lt;/a&gt; seceded from the Tigonus Fiefdom and formed the Kozanset Barony and the Satakalaam County. Later in the same year, Tigonus was annexed into to the Sentinel Kingdom."}

He will ask you to track it down and use the rod to drain its energy, but he will warn against attacking it. \nUse the prod to track down the sphere, then drain some of its energy. The sphere will head off, and Raynor and Kireth will arrive. Talk to Kireth; she wants the construct destroyed rather than repaired.

Eventually, you will track it down on the road southwest of &lt;a href=\"Argent%20Mine\"&gt;Argent Mine&lt;/a&gt;, where it has fallen into the hands of the Winterborn.

The goal is to break into &lt;a href=\"Headman%20Bhosek\"&gt;Headman Bhosek&lt;/a&gt;'s palace and steal the shipping logs from his lockbox.\nWalkthrough.\nAfter recruiting Lerisa, Neramo and Jakarn, meet Kaleen at her hideout in Saintsport. \"Time to make some money,\" she says and reveals the big plan and the target. The target is Headman Bhosek, and they are stealing his shipping logs. They are the key to the fortune, records of every ship's stolen cargo and every illicit payment made to Bhosek. He has violated &lt;a href=\"King%20Fahara%27jad\"&gt;King Fahara'jad'&lt;/a&gt;s orders to stop raiding &lt;a href=\"Bretons%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Breton&lt;/a&gt; ships and these papers will prove this to the king. The king is willing to pay for those papers.\nThe Vestige's job will be to get into Bhosek's palace, steal the logs and get out of there without being detected. For this they will need a disguise. Maybe Lerisa, Jakarn or Neramo can help.\nTalk to all three and ask for assistance and Lerisa will find a disguise. Jakarn will help obtaining the key and Neramo will help disable the guard if they are willing to test this new &lt;a href=\"Dwemer\"&gt;Dwemer&lt;/a&gt; rod on him. With both Jakarn and Neramo there are two options to choose from. Either they help or the Soulless One declines their help.\nHead over to the palace to meet Lerisa and get the disguise. After equipping the robes, enter the palace and ask one of the &lt;a href=\"Hulya\"&gt;servants&lt;/a&gt; about the whereabouts of Bhosek. She points them to the court yard where he entertaining the latest settlers from the mainland.\nHead out to the courtyard and you will find Jakarn with two girls, &lt;a href=\"Agrash\"&gt;Agrash&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Firneril\"&gt;Firneril&lt;/a&gt;. Bhosak is not to be found. Talk to Jakarn and he'll hand over the key. Bhosek has gone back inside to sleep of the attention of the two lovely ladies. Enter the palace again and go upstairs to find the lockbox guarded by &lt;a href=\"Helthar\"&gt;Helthar&lt;/a&gt;. Use the Dwemer device from Neramo on him to disable him and he'll fall to the floor in a second. Open the lockbox and get the shipping logs.\nHead to the docks to find Kaleen and talk to her. She is waiting with King Fahara'jad's envoy beside the ship. Hand over the records and she'll handle things from here. When ready, follow Kaleen on the ship and talk to her. Either learn to know the crew better or leave at once. The ship leaves for &lt;a href=\"Betnikh\"&gt;Betnikh&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"Orsimer%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Orc&lt;/a&gt; island that hasn't yet joined the &lt;a href=\"Daggerfall%20Covenant\"&gt;covenant&lt;/a&gt;, but Kaleen hopes to change that.\nAfter arriving at Betnikh talk to Kaleen again and she will reward them with the &lt;a href=\"Gallant%20Chain\"&gt;Gallant Chain&lt;/a&gt; and some ."}

Their eyes always seem to hold a look of disgust, as if we are a flea upon their bottom. Normally quick words and quicker claws answer such insults, but we have come upon their land now. Walker, we are outnumbered and overpowered here upon the shores of Summerset. It's time to adapt.\nA clever tongue will not do you as much good here as it did in our homeland. These High Elves, well, they hold no laughter in their belly. They ignore their guts and think only with their heads. Foolish, of course, but you can no more change the mind of a High Elf than the turn of the tide. Let us then be the cunning ones, as we always have.\nWe shall start with history. A High Elf expects that a Khajiit know nothing, and this one has found no greater delight than proving those jekosiits wrong. They will think us ignorant of even the most basic knowledge. We shall disappoint them then, yes?\nThe &lt;a href=\"Thrassian%20Plague\"&gt;Thrassian Plague&lt;/a&gt; seems but a faded scar next to the still bleeding cut of the &lt;a href=\"Knahaten%20Flu\"&gt;Knahaten Flu&lt;/a&gt;, but it holds a deep importance to the mer of Summerset. Bezumi thinks this has much to do with the involvement of their god-ancestor &lt;a href=\"Syrabane\"&gt;Syrabane&lt;/a&gt;, also known as the Warlock's God. A mage so powerful that he ascended into godhood, well, is that not the High Elf ideal?\nThe Thrassian Plague was not a natural illness, but rather the work of a vile race known as the Sload. Fat, slow, repugnant, the Sload worked dark magic upon the sea to push this sickness upon much of Tamriel. It spread quickly and fiercely, destroying towns, cities, entire civilizations. But as with most great tragedies, heroes began to emerge. Syrabane is just the one most honored by the High Elves.\nThough Syrabane was known to be an archmage of great power, he did not work his magic alone, for he possessed a most powerful enchanted ring. With this, he was able to save countless lives from the plague. Many say that it was he alone who stopped this devastating illness from engulfing all of Tamriel. Often Bezumi feels that the archmage is more revered for the power of such a feat, rather than his compassion for those he saved, but she holds her tongue with that one.\nArchmage Syrabane did not stop there, of course. He joined forces with the Colovian King of Anvil, Baron-Admiral Bendu Olo, and went to stop the plague at its source. Together they banded together the All Flags Navy, composed of ships filled with not only mer but also Colovians, Redguards, Bretons, and even Argonians. These races put aside their differences and sacrificed many in their assault of Thras, the homeland of the Sload. And amazingly, despite heavy losses, they won. They sank the Coral Kingdoms, and put the Sload into their rightful place deep beneath the waves.\nI find this story particularly useful for a few reasons. I have mentioned before, we must put a swift end to the misconception that we Khajiit are a race ignorant of our allies. Indeed, I hope to publish several more journals on the history and culture of the High Elves. But that is not the only reason. Bezumi chose to start her collection with this particular history because it shows the importance of allies. Of us.\nWithout the military might each race brought to that battle, the victory of the All Flags Navy would have been impossible. Yes, Syrabane was a powerful mage with a useful ring, but he could not have won that fight alone. He had to rely on many others to accomplish such a victory.\nWhen a High Elf turns up his nose as you start to speak? When a mother pulls her child close as you walk by? Remember what Bezumi has told you, walker. Remind them that this is not the first time that the all-mighty Summerset was in need of friends. Remind them that they need us, just as much as we need them."}

We have all seen it, no? The disdain in their eyes, shining as bright as a counterfeit coin. You have heard the condescension that drips from their tongue like honeyed venom. Our tall allies think so little of us &lt;a href=\"Khajiit%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Khajiit&lt;/a&gt;. Time to prove them wrong, walker. Let us beat them at their own game.\nIf you have read my first volume of this series, you'll already have a good idea of the importance that High Elves place on their history. We know this, yes, but even this pride tends to pale next to the vanity the mer hold for their familial past. Most know the name, occupation, and supposed greatness of their ancestors dating back centuries. And they will be most keen to tell you of them, this one assures you of that.\nFamily is everything to the High Elves, but do not take that to be sentiment. It is chains that they bind themselves with, a title that is set in stone. Only great feats can elevate them, and so they crave each day for that moment of their apotheosis. Many choose to prove themselves through arcane feats, as magic runs strong and often within their veins. Others throw themselves within their art, hoping to paint a masterpiece of produce a melody glorious enough to rise their status.\nYes, the High Elves create great walls before themselves. Climb, they say! But the way is often hard. Never have I seen such malice as that between fellow artists here in &lt;a href=\"Summerset%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Summerset&lt;/a&gt;. I've met thieves and assassins with more curtesy towards their rivals! The mages look down upon all, but quickly grow envious of their peers' power. Even among each other, the High Elves seek to look from above.\nThey care not for you, walker, nor your family. To them, we have but one title. Khajiit. And thus we are lower, and thus we are useful only to be used. This we know. To elevate yourself in the eyes of a High Elf, well, it is not an easy feat. You must prove your worth, again and again. Exhausting work for even the most diligent, but still, we must try.\nBezumi has found many High Elves to be irresistible to challenges of skill. Dangle a chance to prove themselves better, and always they will bite. We know though, the honor that a cunning win still brings. Always make sure to stock the odds within your favor, yes?\nWinning a challenge against a High Elf has always proven to have ... mixed results. Some will demand a rematch, so wounded is their pride. Others will throw a most vivid tantrum and storm off, declaring you a cheat. But there will be an honorable few who shall bow their head and concede defeat. Within them will alight a small flame of respect. Let us fan those flames.\nDespite this one's advice and encouragement, she knows that not every High Elf can be won over. Many have become blind and deaf to all but their own opinion. Do not let them dishearten you, walker. Do not let them win. Let them come at us with their venom, with their ignorance. We must be the ones to change, yes, but into something better. Into something greater."}

He lead the &lt;a href=\"Third%20Empire\"&gt;Third Empire&lt;/a&gt; during the events of and . His personal brand was a wolf's head, his most trusted men had a tattoo painted into their body. Titus had a lean face, strong chin, and green eyes.\nHistory.\nEarly life.\nTitus Mede came to power after the &lt;a href=\"Oblivion%20Crisis\"&gt;Oblivion Crisis&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Martin%20Septim\"&gt;Martin Septim&lt;/a&gt;'s sacrifice, which ended the &lt;a href=\"Septim%20Dynasty\"&gt;Septim Dynasty&lt;/a&gt;. He came from humble origins, but he elevated his status over the years. He was at first soldier in an outlaw army, then rose to be a warlord in &lt;a href=\"Colovia\"&gt;Colovia&lt;/a&gt;, in which he learned many rules of warfare. After that he became a king in &lt;a href=\"Cyrodiil\"&gt;Cyrodiil&lt;/a&gt;. Some time after becoming a king, he saw the weakened state the Empire was in after the Oblivion Crisis and how weak the current emperor was. He started to develop a plan to overthrow the current emperor, take the &lt;a href=\"Ruby%20Throne\"&gt;Ruby Throne&lt;/a&gt;, and become &lt;a href=\"Emperor\"&gt;Emperor&lt;/a&gt;.\nBecoming Emperor.\nUsing the Empire's weakened state to his advantage he invaded and took the &lt;a href=\"Imperial%20City\"&gt;Imperial City&lt;/a&gt; with less than a thousand men, usurping the throne from &lt;a href=\"Thules%20the%20Gibbering\"&gt;Thules the Gibbering&lt;/a&gt; and finally becoming Emperor of &lt;a href=\"Tamriel\"&gt;Tamriel&lt;/a&gt;. However, another warlord by the name of &lt;a href=\"Eddar%20Olin\"&gt;Eddar Olin&lt;/a&gt; also wanted to become Emperor and he gathered an army and invaded northward into Cyrodiil. Due to the Empire's weakened state, he was forced to use what little army he had to stop this. He ended up successfully repelling the invasion with barely twice the number he had invaded with.\nMost people saw him as a conqueror, unworthy to be the Emperor. Most members of the &lt;a href=\"Elder%20Council\"&gt;Elder Council&lt;/a&gt; were in favor of Thules but Titus's close associate &lt;a href=\"Hierem\"&gt;Hierem&lt;/a&gt; convinced them to see Titus more as liberator than conqueror. He kept Hierem around because he didn't have a choice. Hierem was the most important man in the empire besides him, so Titus put &lt;a href=\"Letine%20Arese\"&gt;Letine Arese&lt;/a&gt; in the minister's office to spy on him and warn the Emperor about any threat.\nBuilding a better Empire.\nThe Empire was weak, and Titus knew that. Any opposition against the Empire could bring it down. There was a General, known as &lt;a href=\"General%20Takar\"&gt;General Takar&lt;/a&gt;, from &lt;a href=\"Hammerfell\"&gt;Hammerfell&lt;/a&gt; that was fighting against the Empire at the time. Titus personally confronted the General and won him over, supposedly through personal combat. Afterwards, Takar became one of Mede's most trusted generals.\nDue to a number of events, alongside the Stormcrown Interregnum, many imperial provinces left the Empire, now only consisting of seven of the nine counties of &lt;a href=\"Cyrodiil\"&gt;Cyrodiil&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Skyrim\"&gt;Skyrim&lt;/a&gt;. Titus Mede went out to reclaim Leyawiin, Bravil, &lt;a href=\"Hammerfell\"&gt;Hammerfell&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"High%20Rock\"&gt;High Rock&lt;/a&gt;. Titus himself described this as \"...and I hammered this empire back together with a handful of rivets\".\nIn his personal life, Titus found and married an unknown woman and together they had a son whom they named &lt;a href=\"Attrebus%20Mede\"&gt;Attrebus Mede&lt;/a&gt;. When his son Attrebus was born, Hierem proposed an idea to make him look like a hero. He was raised being told that he was a great warrior and a hero. Titus didn't stop this behavior even when Attrebus grew up. &lt;a href=\"Gulan\"&gt;Gulan&lt;/a&gt; used to report to the Emperor every time Attrebus went to be a hero in the wrong place and he would do something to stop it.\nUmbriel Crisis.\nAttrebus tried to convince Titus to allow him go to &lt;a href=\"Black%20Marsh\"&gt;Black Marsh&lt;/a&gt; to stop &lt;a href=\"Umbriel\"&gt;Umbriel&lt;/a&gt;. Titus did not see any threat in Umbriel, so he forbade Attrebus to embark on such adventure. However, he sent scouts and mages to investigate the flying city.\nAttrebus disobeyed his father's orders and marched into Umbriel. However, he was betrayed by &lt;a href=\"Radhasa\"&gt;Radhasa&lt;/a&gt;, and his men were ambushed. Radhasa made it look as if they had killed the prince.\nShe beheaded a body and dressed it with Attrebus' clothes. Titus had to identify the body, but he identified that it was not his son.. His suspicion was further corroborated by Inspector &lt;a href=\"Colin\"&gt;Colin&lt;/a&gt;, who explained that it looked like someone wanted to make them think that the prince was dead.\nColin contacted the &lt;a href=\"Emperor\"&gt;Emperor&lt;/a&gt; again when he discovered that &lt;a href=\"Hierem\"&gt;Hierem&lt;/a&gt; could be behind the Umbriel Crisis and his son's kidnapping. Titus could not risk confronting Hierem without solid evidence, so he ordered Colin to continue investigating. He offered Colin a key to Hierem's ministry and rooms.\nTitus received a letter from &lt;a href=\"Vuhon\"&gt;Vuhon&lt;/a&gt; demanding him to evacuate the &lt;a href=\"Imperial%20City\"&gt;Imperial City&lt;/a&gt;. Titus refused to abandon the heart of the Empire, so he sent the legions to stop &lt;a href=\"Umbriel\"&gt;Umbriel&lt;/a&gt;. The attack on the flying city failed, but Attrebus and &lt;a href=\"Sul\"&gt;Sul&lt;/a&gt; destroyed the &lt;a href=\"Ingenium\"&gt;Ingenium&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Mere-Glim\"&gt;Mere-Glim&lt;/a&gt; guided Umbriel into the &lt;a href=\"Realm%20of%20the%20Hist\"&gt;Realm of the Hist&lt;/a&gt;. Titus was proud of his son, and he planned to tell everyone about his feat. However, Attrebus thought that it would be better to give credit to &lt;a href=\"The%20College%20of%20Whispers\"&gt;The College of Whispers&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"The%20Synod\"&gt;The Synod&lt;/a&gt;. They had worked together and it could be a start to their reconciliation.\nSuccession.\nWhen Titus eventually died at an unknown date, it is presumed that his only heir, &lt;a href=\"Attrebus%20Mede\"&gt;Attrebus&lt;/a&gt; ruled after his death and he continued the &lt;a href=\"Mede%20Dynasty\"&gt;Mede Dynasty&lt;/a&gt;. Titus also was the ancestor of &lt;a href=\"Titus%20Mede%20II\"&gt;Titus Mede II&lt;/a&gt; although how distant they are is unknown. Titus also had a brother who built a Longhouse in the settlement of &lt;a href=\"Ione\"&gt;Ione&lt;/a&gt;."}

Only the latter three remained peaceful and prosperous, as Hammerfell was in civil war during this time. The Imperial military was also greatly weakened from many wars that the Empire had been involved in, and what remained of the Legion forces was scattered across the provinces.\n&lt;a href=\"Great%20War\"&gt;Great War&lt;/a&gt;.\nAfter three years of being Emperor, members of the &lt;a href=\"Thalmor\"&gt;Thalmor&lt;/a&gt;, the governmental body of the &lt;a href=\"Third%20Aldmeri%20Dominion\"&gt;Third Aldmeri Dominion&lt;/a&gt;, visited the &lt;a href=\"Imperial%20City\"&gt;Imperial City&lt;/a&gt;. On the 30th of &lt;a href=\"Frostfall\"&gt;Frostfall&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"4E%20171\"&gt;4E 171&lt;/a&gt;, an ambassador arrived at the Imperial City with an ultimatum for the new Emperor and a gift in a covered cart. This ultimatum demanded tributes, the disbandment of the &lt;a href=\"Blades\"&gt;Blades&lt;/a&gt;, outlawing of &lt;a href=\"Talos\"&gt;Talos&lt;/a&gt; worship, and the ceding a large portion of southern Hammerfell to the Dominion. Despite the weakness of the Imperial military, as warned by his generals, Titus Mede refused the ultimatum. As a result, the ambassador showed the Emperor the gift, the heads of all the Blades agents from within the Aldmeri Dominion, marking the start of the Great War.\nThe Sack of the Imperial City.\nThe Dominion had been sending in numerous forces into Imperial lands leading up to &lt;a href=\"4E%20173\"&gt;4E 173&lt;/a&gt;, making advances on the eastern bank near the Imperial City, despite Imperial reinforcements from Skyrim bolstering the Emperor's main army. By the end of &lt;a href=\"4E%20173\"&gt;4E 173&lt;/a&gt;, the Imperial capital was surrounded, with only the supply route to &lt;a href=\"Bruma\"&gt;Bruma&lt;/a&gt; in the north remaining open.\nThe next year, in &lt;a href=\"4E%20174\"&gt;4E 174&lt;/a&gt;, the Dominion committed all available forces to the Cyrodiil front. During the spring of that year, Aldmeri reinforcements were gathering in southern Cyrodiil, and launched an assault on the Imperial City itself on the 12th of &lt;a href=\"Second%20Seed\"&gt;Second Seed&lt;/a&gt;. One of the Aldmeri armies drove north to fully surround the Imperial City, while the main army of &lt;a href=\"Lord%20Naarifin\"&gt;Lord Naarifin&lt;/a&gt; attacked the City from the south, east, and west. Titus Mede decided to fight out of the capital instead of remaining within it during the siege, once more ignoring the advice of his generals.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Eighth%20Legion\"&gt;Eighth Legion&lt;/a&gt; covered the Emperor's retreat in a desperate rearguard action on the walls of the capital. The Emperor's main army forced their way through the Aldmeri army in the north, meeting the Legions of &lt;a href=\"General%20Jonna\"&gt;General Jonna&lt;/a&gt; who came marching from Skyrim. In the meantime, the Imperial Capital fell, resulting in the Imperial City being sacked by the Dominion. The Imperial Palace was burned, White-Gold Tower was looted, and many atrocities were carried out against the civilians living in the city.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Battle%20of%20the%20Red%20Ring\"&gt;Battle of the Red Ring&lt;/a&gt;.\nIn the winter of 4E 174 to &lt;a href=\"4E%20175\"&gt;4E 175&lt;/a&gt;, the Thalmor were convinced that the fighting in Cyrodiil was all but over. They made several attempts to negotiate with the Emperor, and Titus Mede encouraged the Thalmor in their belief that he was planning to surrender. In reality, he gathered his forces to retake the Imperial Capital. Imperial desertion did occur, as numbers of Legionnaires believed the Empire was doomed. The Forgotten Hero, alongside their companions, informed the Emperor of Lord Naarifin's plan to unleash &lt;a href=\"The%20Culling\"&gt;The Culling&lt;/a&gt; prophecy. However, the Emperor knew an attack on the Imperial City was doomed to fail, as the Dominion was able to somehow predict the Empire's every move. The Hero volunteered to infiltrate the city, and discover the source of this power. It would later turn out that the Dominion held the &lt;a href=\"Orb%20of%20Vaermina\"&gt;Orb of Vaermina&lt;/a&gt;, and used this as a means to spy on the Legion. When it was destroyed, the Legions started their advance on the Capital.\nWhile the Emperor himself was wounded by Aldmeri Assassins just before the battle of the Red Ring would take place, and thus could not lead the charge himself, the battle was still planned by the Emperor. &lt;a href=\"The%20Forgotten%20Hero\"&gt;The Forgotten Hero&lt;/a&gt; would wear the Emperor's armor, and take his stead to boost morale among the Legions and convince them that the Emperor was strong. The Imperial City would be surrounded on all sides by the Imperial forces. The main army was commanded by the Forgotten Hero, and would advance from the north. Two other armies, commanded by General Jonna and &lt;a href=\"General%20Decianus\"&gt;General Decianus&lt;/a&gt;, surrounded the southern, western, and eastern sides of the city. Lord Naarifin, despite his attempts to unleash hordes of Daedra, was defeated by the Forgotten Hero. The Emperor captured Lord Naarifin, and kept him alive for thirty-three days, hanging from the White-Gold Tower.\nThe &lt;a href=\"White-Gold%20Concordat\"&gt;White-Gold Concordat&lt;/a&gt;.\nWhile the Battle of the Red Ring resulted in an Imperial victory, the Legions were too weakened to continue their advance. The entire Imperial military didn't have more than half its soldiers fit for duty, not counting the annihilations of three Legions in their entirety. Titus Mede knew there would be no better time for peace, and thus signed the White-Gold Concordat, marking the end of the Great War. The terms of the Concordat were largely unchanged to the original ultimatum, but Titus Mede believed the peace was necessary to give the Empire a chance to regain its strength. By 4E 175, most of the Empire welcomed peace at almost any price. Hammerfell refused to sign the Concordat, however, and as such, Titus Mede was forced to renounce Hammerfell as an Imperial province, leaving Hammerfell to fight the Dominion until &lt;a href=\"4E%20180\"&gt;4E 180&lt;/a&gt;, until the signing of the &lt;a href=\"Second%20Treaty%20of%20Stros%20M%27kai\"&gt;Second Treaty of Stros M'kai&lt;/a&gt;. In response for the signing of the White-Gold Concordat, the Jarls of Skyrim were given chests of gold by the Empire.\nPost-Great War.\nOriginally, the Imperial Legion did not enforce the outlawing of Talos worship, as dictated by the Concordat. However, when &lt;a href=\"Ulfric%20Stormcloak\"&gt;Ulfric Stormcloak&lt;/a&gt; made the Legion openly accept free Talos worship, the Emperor was forced to crack down on Talos worship, and allow the &lt;a href=\"Thalmor%20Justiciar\"&gt;Thalmor Justiciar&lt;/a&gt;s into Imperial land.\nAs a result of the enforcement of the Talos ban, the &lt;a href=\"Stormcloaks\"&gt;Stormcloaks&lt;/a&gt; would be founded. Local support in &lt;a href=\"Skyrim\"&gt;Skyrim&lt;/a&gt; for the Emperor varied. There were those who considered the Emperor to have renounced both humanity and honor when the Concordat was signed. Others considered that the Emperor didn't have any choice in signing the Concordat, as without it the Dominion would have destroyed the Empire. In response to the rebellion in Skyrim, the Emperor sent &lt;a href=\"General%20Tullius%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;General Tullius&lt;/a&gt; to quell the rebellion.\nDespite the signing of the &lt;a href=\"White-Gold%20Concordat\"&gt;White-Gold Concordat&lt;/a&gt;, the Empire was rebuilding its forces for the next conflict with the Aldmeri Dominion and stationing the bulk of them on the Cyrodiilic-Aldmeri border. The Emperor refused to send Tullius any reinforcements in fear of weakening the border with the Dominion.\nPossible Assassination.\nAssuming certain conditions were met, Titus Mede II may have fallen victim to a plot on his life. &lt;a href=\"Amaund%20Motierre\"&gt;Amaund Motierre&lt;/a&gt;, a &lt;a href=\"Breton\"&gt;Breton&lt;/a&gt; noble from Cyrodiil, contacted the Dark Brotherhood in Skyrim in &lt;a href=\"4E%20201\"&gt;4E 201&lt;/a&gt;. He ordered a string of assassinations, beginning with the slaying of the Emperor's cousin, &lt;a href=\"Vittoria%20Vici\"&gt;Vittoria Vici&lt;/a&gt; to draw the Emperor to Skyrim, followed up by the assassination of the &lt;a href=\"Balagog%20gro-Nolob\"&gt;Gourmet&lt;/a&gt;, who would cook for the Emperor.\nA decoy of the Emperor was first sent out to &lt;a href=\"Solitude\"&gt;Solitude&lt;/a&gt;, in an attempt to kill the assassin ordered to murder the Emperor. While they were in Solitude, attempting to murder the decoy, the &lt;a href=\"Penitus%20Oculatus\"&gt;Penitus Oculatus&lt;/a&gt; raided the &lt;a href=\"Dark%20Brotherhood%20Sanctuary%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Dark Brotherhood Sanctuary&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Falkreath%20Hold\"&gt;Falkreath Hold&lt;/a&gt;, having learned its passphrase shortly before the assassination would take place.\nThe assassin would survive, however, and through Amaund Motierre, discover that the real Emperor was on the ship \"&lt;a href=\"The%20Katariah\"&gt;The Katariah&lt;/a&gt;\". The Emperor would be assassinated by the Dark Brotherhood on board his ship. Motierre would claim that the death of Titus Mede would bring about a necessary change in Imperial policy, and that his death served both the Empire and all of Tamriel. It is unknown if Amaund Motierre was later also killed by the assassin, as the Emperor had requested as his last wish from the assassin."}

According to &lt;a href=\"The%20Talos%20Mistake\"&gt;The Talos Mistake&lt;/a&gt;, Emperor Titus II had always believed the worshiping of Talos as a deity was morally wrong and that the ban on Talos worship was in no way coerced by the Aldmeri Dominion. Though considering Titus rejected the outlawing of Talos worship demanded by the &lt;a href=\"Thalmor\"&gt;Thalmor&lt;/a&gt; at the start of the Great War, the publication may be an effort to save face after the Empire was terribly diminished by the Great War.\nThis event led to the &lt;a href=\"Markarth%20Incident\"&gt;Markarth Incident&lt;/a&gt;, which itself sparked the &lt;a href=\"Civil%20War\"&gt;Civil War&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Skyrim\"&gt;Skyrim&lt;/a&gt; between the &lt;a href=\"Stormcloaks\"&gt;Stormcloaks&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Imperial%20Legion%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Imperial Legion&lt;/a&gt;.

However, in reality it was not Titus Mede leading the charge as he had been wounded, but the &lt;a href=\"Forgotten%20Hero\"&gt;Forgotten Hero&lt;/a&gt; wearing the &lt;a href=\"Imperial%20Dragon%20Armor\"&gt;Emperor's armor&lt;/a&gt; at his request.\nInteractions.\nIf the &lt;a href=\"Last%20Dragonborn\"&gt;Dragonborn&lt;/a&gt; was appointed &lt;a href=\"Listener\"&gt;Listener&lt;/a&gt; of the &lt;a href=\"Dark%20Brotherhood%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Dark Brotherhood&lt;/a&gt; during the &lt;a href=\"Fourth%20Era\"&gt;Fourth Era&lt;/a&gt;, they might have infiltrated &lt;a href=\"The%20Katariah\"&gt;The Katariah&lt;/a&gt; to assassinate Emperor Titus Mede II on a contract, set up by &lt;a href=\"Amaund%20Motierre\"&gt;Amaund Motierre&lt;/a&gt; of the &lt;a href=\"Elder%20Council\"&gt;Elder Council&lt;/a&gt;.\n&lt;a href=\"To%20Kill%20an%20Empire\"&gt;To Kill an Empire&lt;/a&gt;.\nTo finally execute the &lt;a href=\"Dark%20Brotherhood%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Dark Brotherhood&lt;/a&gt;'s master plan of killing the Emperor, the &lt;a href=\"Last%20Dragonborn\"&gt;Dragonborn&lt;/a&gt; impersonates &lt;a href=\"Balagog%20gro-Nolob\"&gt;The Gourmet&lt;/a&gt;, Titus Mede's personal chef, to try to add &lt;a href=\"Jarrin%20Root\"&gt;Jarrin Root&lt;/a&gt;, a &lt;a href=\"Poison%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;poisonous&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"plant\"&gt;plant&lt;/a&gt; capable of instantly killing anyone who ingests it, into the Emperor's meal. If the root was added, the Emperor dies after tasting the &lt;a href=\"Food%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;food&lt;/a&gt;, and, if it wasn't, the Dragonborn must silently kill him. While the Dragonborn escapes, they are stopped by three &lt;a href=\"Penitus%20Oculatus\"&gt;Penitus Oculatus&lt;/a&gt; Agents who inform that the Emperor was simply a decoy, and &lt;a href=\"Astrid%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;someone&lt;/a&gt; in the Brotherhood leaked the assassination plot and told the &lt;a href=\"Penitus%20Oculatus\"&gt;Penitus Oculatus&lt;/a&gt; to capture the Dragonborn.\n&lt;a href=\"Hail%20Sithis%21\"&gt;Hail Sithis!&lt;/a&gt;.\nWhen the Dragonborn spoke with the Emperor, he did not resist and embraced his death, stating that there is no escape from the Dark Brotherhood. However, he asked for one final favor before he was assassinated: for the Dark Brotherhood's contractor, &lt;a href=\"Amaund%20Motierre\"&gt;Amaund Motierre&lt;/a&gt;, to be killed because of his contract.\nNo extra reward is gained for doing so, aside from some extra loot on Amaund Motierre's corpse, which consists of a few &lt;a href=\"Precious%20Gems%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;valuable gems&lt;/a&gt;.

There are 5 versions of this letter.\nContents.\nThe opening and closing paragraphs are the same for all versions, but the ones in between will reflect on which decision the Dragonborn made with the beggar.\nWine.\nFirst of all, I'm sorry about the tests. I wanted to see how you'd treat the beggar. My hope was that it'd give me a window into your mind, and bring comfort to mine.\nYou gave the beggar &lt;a href=\"Wine%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;wine&lt;/a&gt;. It'll help him forget his troubles; give him a reprieve. But such gifts can quickly sour. Come morning, the beggar may regret your choice, or worse yet, he might repeat it. \nSo my advice to you is to view every action in its entirety. Only then can you make your choices with clear eyes.\nLastly, to the ones I knew in life, don't mourn my death. As one of you once told me, when all you do is look to the past, it's time to close the book on one's future. I do so on my own terms. Goodbye.\n1 Septim.\nFirst of all, I'm sorry about the tests. I wanted to see how you'd treat the beggar. My hope was that it'd give me a window into your mind, and bring comfort to mine.\nYou gave the beggar a single &lt;a href=\"Septim%20%28Coin%29\"&gt;septim&lt;/a&gt;. I like the amount. You did what you could without placing a burden on yourself. And yet, on its own a single piece does nothing for him. It's only when the entire town does its part, each one placing a septim, that the beggar has enough to eat.\nSo my advice to you is to remember the value of company. Whether you're a bandit or a hero, no one can do it alone. You have to work together, one gold piece at a time, to do what needs to be done.\nLastly, to the ones I knew in life, don't mourn my death. As one of you once told me, when all you do is look to the past, it's time to close the book on one's future. I do so on my own terms. Goodbye.\n100 Septims.\nFirst of all, I'm sorry about the tests. I wanted to see how you'd treat the beggar. My hope was that it'd give me a window into your mind, and bring comfort to mine.\nYou gave the beggar a full purse of gold. You're someone who goes above and beyond, putting the lives of others above your own. But not even a thousand septims can save the life of every man, woman, and child.\nSo my advice to you is to not fall victim to your kindness. There are people like me who will take advantage of it. And there are times when you'll have to make a hard decision for the greater gain. Save who you can, but do what you must.\nLastly, to the ones I knew in life, don't mourn my death. As one of you once told me, when all you do is look to the past, it's time to close the book on one's future. I do so on my own terms. Goodbye.\nPrayer.\nFirst of all, I'm sorry about the tests. I wanted to see how you'd treat the beggar. My hope was that it'd give me a window into your mind, and bring comfort to mine.\nYou chose to pray for the beggar, putting your faith in the &lt;a href=\"Divines\"&gt;Divines&lt;/a&gt;. After all, maybe it isn't food or water people need, but hope in something greater than themselves. But the world is not a place where hope alone will save you.\nMy advice to you is to seize your destiny. Don't wait for an idle God. Then you'll be a worthy judge and executioner for your enemies, just as you were for me.\nLastly, to the ones I knew in life, don't mourn my death. As one of you once told me, when all you do is look to the past, it's time to close the book on one's future. I do so on my own terms. Goodbye.\nBread.\nFirst of all, I'm sorry about the tests. I wanted to see how you'd treat the beggar. My hope was that it'd give me a window into your mind, and bring comfort to mine.\nYou gave the beggar &lt;a href=\"Bread%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;bread&lt;/a&gt;, a choice I agree with. Gold can be wasted. Wine can be a poison. But a meal can never be squandered. Perhaps if I had been given a similar gift, my life would have been different.\nAs such, I deem you a worthy judge. Hopefully you will be a swift executioner. Either way, I thank you.\nLastly, to the ones I knew in life, don't mourn my death. As one of you once told me, when all you do is look to the past, it's time to close the book on one's future. I do so on my own terms. Goodbye."}

They ruined my career as the preeminent architect in the West.\nSuch was my rage that I sought the &lt;a href=\"Daedra%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Daedra&lt;/a&gt;, who came to me, offering a pact for my talents. They would capture my tormentors and imprison them here. In return, I would build for them. I accepted gladly.\nIn Wayrest, I designed inescapable prisons for law enforcement, opaline palaces for the nobles of the Gardens District. My works were heralded as a crossing of artistic perfection and architectural function. But what I've built for the planes of Oblivion are so much more. Black spires for the &lt;a href=\"Molag%20Bal%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Scheming Lord&lt;/a&gt; of Coldharbour are instruments of torture as much as they are monuments to his greatness. The razor pits of &lt;a href=\"Deadlands\"&gt;Deadlands&lt;/a&gt; never dull, and cut flesh, bone, and spirit essence for the &lt;a href=\"Mehrunes%20Dagon\"&gt;Prince of Destruction&lt;/a&gt;\u2014in ways that even the most powerful healers can never mend.\nEven so, all of these creations\u2014from the gestating cyst-towers of Molag Bal to the sparkling &lt;a href=\"Pellingare%20Manor\"&gt;Pellingare Manor&lt;/a&gt; in Wayrest\u2014are but baubles compared to the Vaults. They are my &lt;a href=\"Daedric%20Crescent\"&gt;Daedric Crescent&lt;/a&gt;, my &lt;a href=\"Akaviri%20Warblade\"&gt;Akaviri Warblade&lt;/a&gt;, the culmination of my skill, my greatest creation.\nAnd they grow only more extraordinary with time. What was once a place of eternal anguish for the three charlatans who ruined my mortal life has grown to become a nexus of torture for all manner of &lt;a href=\"Tamriel\"&gt;Tamriel&lt;/a&gt;ic &lt;a href=\"souls\"&gt;souls&lt;/a&gt;. So exquisite is the work I do in these Vaults that even the &lt;a href=\"Daedric%20Princes\"&gt;Daedric Princes&lt;/a&gt; send souls to me to oversee.\nAnd as for you, dear guest\u2014know that the pain you experience here is the result of lifetimes of refinement and iteration. Embrace it, and writhe, and be awed."}

Falco will mention that there is a thief who is stealing ore from the mine, and that he strongly suspects it is Uryn Maren. He will task the Nerevarine to search Maren's chest in his house to find evidence of the theft.\nThe Nerevarine should search Maren's home for a chest. The chest will be in the bedroom but will be empty. There is no one in the house, so the Nerevarine has the opportunity to steal anything they want. After leaving the house, the Nerevarine should return to Falco and he will express his disappointment that there is no evidence against Maren. Falco, however, continues to suspect Maren and tasks the Nerevarine with discretely following him through the mine to observe his activities.\nThe Nerevarine should immediately head to the Raven Rock Mine where Maren should be not too far from the entrance. Once the Nerevarine has found him, he will start walking. The Nerevarine must then pursue him whilst remaining undetected. Maren will make his way to the supply room, presumably to steal some of the ore, at which point the Nerevarine should contront him. Maren will tell the Nerevarine that it was Carnius Magius who told him to steal the ore.\nThe Nerevarine should return to Falco with the information. He will tell the them that he already suspected Carnius was involved, and will ask them to go to &lt;a href=\"Fort%20Frostmoth%20%28Bloodmoon%29\"&gt;Fort Frostmoth&lt;/a&gt; and confront Carnius. When confronted, Carnius will deny everything, and will call Maren a liar as well as a thief, saying that he will be dealt with shortly.\nUpon returning to Falco, he will inform the Nerevarine that Maren died in captivity, but that there were no witnesses and so he is unable to accuse anyone of murder. He will then give the Nerevarine their reward and the quest will be complete."}

{"id": "1683", "revid": "34165109", "url": "https://elderscrolls.fandom.com/wiki?curid=1683", "title": "Bethesda Softworks", "text": "Bethesda Softworks, LLC, a subsidiary of &lt;a href=\"ZeniMax%20Media\"&gt;ZeniMax Media&lt;/a&gt;, is a video game developer and publisher. Bethesda Softworks is notable for developing the game series.\nHistory.\nBethesda Softworks has been a developer and publisher of interactive entertainment content for over two- and a half decades. Founded in 1985 by Christopher Weaver in Bethesda, Maryland; they moved to Rockville, Maryland in 1990, and have a long history of PC and console games. Weaver, company President Vlatko Andonov recalls, had originally wanted to call the company \"Softworks,\" but found the name taken. \"So, our founder, sitting at his kitchen table in Bethesda decided after laborious thought to add Bethesda to Softworks and there you have it!\" Bethesda was acquired by ZeniMax Media, Inc., co-founded by Weaver, in 1999.\nThe company's founder, Chris Weaver, had, by 's release, transformed the company from a committee-run organization to one run which had to follow \"a single person's vision\": his. \"For 18 years,\" Weaver stated, \"from 1981 through 1999, all the money that was invested in the company was my own.\" Prior to creating Bethesda, Weaver had worked at MIT on \"speech parsers, graphic interface and synthesized worlds - what people now call virtual reality...bleeding edge stuff.\" He had worked in news broadcast directing at NBC and as the Director of Technology Forecasting for ABC, eventually becoming Chief Engineer to the House Subcommittee on Communications. He had created Bethesda \"to see if the PC market was a viable place to develop games.\" The executive command and personal investment allotted to himself allowed the company to become, in Weaver's words, \"a boutique house,\" a house which \"kept rewriting rules and inventing new things.\" Weaver, in the opinion of journalist Joe Blancato, was a man \"used to having good ideas.\" The first employee after Weaver, Edward Fletcher, was trained as an electrical engineer, had worked as a debugger, computer equipment designer and programmer. Fletcher's vision for the company was humbler than Weaver's, hoping only to design a game for the Amiga at a low cost.\nThe rewritten rules of Bethesda's first title, \"Gridiron!\", were essentially produced by happenstance. Fletcher wanted to produce a football game that relied on what most sports games of the 1980s had before it: lookup tables of player statistics. Weaver, though he knew little of the sport, found lookup tables boring, and believed that there must be a better way to make a football game. Electronic Arts was so impressed with \"Gridiron!\" that they hired Bethesda to develop the first \"John Madden Football\". Bethesda eventually decided to sue EA in 1987 for USD$7.3 million, claiming that the company halted cross-console release of \"Gridiron!\" after incorporating many of its elements into their own \"John Madden Football\". Bethesda's early games scored respectably in the gaming press, earning such accolades as \"the most accurate and enjoyable simulation of a sport I have ever had the pleasure to play,\" \"the best ice hockey sim yet,\" for Wayne Gretzky Hockey, and a note that \"Gridiron!\" \"demands a look.\"\nWith a broad panoply of games in role-playing, racing, simulation, and sports, Bethesda Softworks major franchises are distributed worldwide.\nBethesda is credited with the creation of the first physics-based sports simulation (\"Gridiron!\"') in 1986 for the Atari ST, Commodore Amiga and Commodore 64/128, which led to Bethesda's creation of the first \"John Madden Football\" game for Electronic Arts. Despite their long history of development in many genres, they are perhaps best known for creating \"The Elder Scrolls\" RPG series which Weaver initiated in 1992, based upon the original programming of Julian Lefay. The first chapter of the series, entitled \"The Elder Scrolls: Arena\", was released in 1994. Since that time, numerous other chapters have been released. The previous chapter, , was released in November 2011. is the latest in the series, having been released on April 4, 2014.\nBethesda is also the publisher for three \"Star Trek\" games, \"Star Trek - Legacy\" (For PC/Xbox 360), \"Star Trek - Tactical Assault\" (for Nintendo DS/PlayStation Portable), and \"Star Trek - Encounters\" (PS2).\nIn 2004, Bethesda acquired the \"Fallout\" franchise from Interplay Entertainment. Todd Howard said in January 2007 that \"We started work [on \"Fallout 3\"] in late 2004 with a few people. We only had about 10 people on it until wrapped, but most of our staff is on it now.\"\nBethesda Software is also becoming well known for their work on Xbox 360s, with them being the \"first company to ever release an expansion pack on the Xbox 360, back with \"Oblivion\", and also the \"guinea pigs\" for introducing Downloadable Content to the Xbox, presumably with the \"Fallout\" series.\nThe Elder Scrolls series.\nThe following is a complete list of publications made by Bethesda in series."}

Upon attempting to activate the relic, Renwic realized that souls would be necessary to power it \u2013 a sacrifice he was unwilling to make.\nIn &lt;a href=\"2E%20582\"&gt;2E 582&lt;/a&gt;, the necromantic &lt;a href=\"Bloodthorn%20Cult\"&gt;Bloodthorn Cult&lt;/a&gt; invaded the island, determined to find the relic and use its power. With the aid of the &lt;a href=\"Vestige\"&gt;Vestige&lt;/a&gt;, the Seamount Clan was able to end the plot against the island, killing the Cult's leadership on Betnikh and finding the Ayleid relic. The relic would either be saved for use by the Daggerfall Covenant or destroyed. Regardless of the relic's fate, Chief Tazgol and the Seamount Clan join the Daggerfall Covenant.\nLocations.\nThe following are locations accessible in Betnikh and, with the exception of &lt;a href=\"Unmarked%20Locations%20%28Online%29\"&gt;unmarked locations&lt;/a&gt;, are discoverable on the map. Points of Interest serve as locations with unique side quests, while &lt;a href=\"Cities%20%28Online%29\"&gt;cities&lt;/a&gt; serve as the centralised areas with multiple sublocations and act as a hub for services and &lt;a href=\"Merchants%20%28Online%29\"&gt;merchants&lt;/a&gt;. Explanations of the types of locations are provided in the &lt;a href=\"Locations%20%28Online%29%23Types\"&gt;main locations page&lt;/a&gt;.\nQuests.\nBetnikh features a series of zone story quests and unrelated side quests. The zone story quests tie into the &lt;a href=\"Daggerfall%20Covenant\"&gt;Daggerfall Covenant&lt;/a&gt;'s overarching storyline and carries on from &lt;a href=\"Stros%20M%27Kai%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Stros M'Kai&lt;/a&gt; before continuing to &lt;a href=\"Glenumbra%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Glenumbra&lt;/a&gt;. It is not necessary to complete the story quests for zones prior to those in Betnikh. Side quests are non-sequential and can be completed in any order, except where one carries on from another. &lt;a href=\"Repeatable%20quests\"&gt;Repeatable quests&lt;/a&gt; can be completed multiple times: weekly for arenas and trials and daily for all others.\nItem Sets.\nItem sets are related armor and weapons that, when worn together, provide unique benefits. Overland sets can be acquired from world bosses, world events, delves, public dungeons and containers and as quest rewards; dungeon sets can be acquired from within group dungeons; monster sets can be acquired from the final boss of veteran group dungeons and Undaunted Enclaves; and crafted sets can be created at specific locations across the zone.\nSkyshards.\nThree Skyshards can be found in Betnikh totaling in one &lt;a href=\"skill%20point\"&gt;skill point&lt;/a&gt;. The zone guide provides clues as to the location of each Skyshard, but many can be found simply by exploring and watching for the distinctive pillar of light they emit. Skyshards will appear on the map and compass when the Vestige is close to one and will remain discovered on the map even if it was not collected.\nAchievements.\nAchievements can be earned by completing specific tasks such as completing quests and discovering locations. Achievements are separated into categories and their progress is viewable from the journal. Earning achievement provides the Vestige a number of points, and some achievements unlock unique rewards such as &lt;a href=\"Furnishings%20%28Online%29\"&gt;furnishings&lt;/a&gt; that can be bought from Achievement Furnishers or &lt;a href=\"collectibles\"&gt;collectibles&lt;/a&gt;.\nFish.\nFish can be caught from fishing hotspots, ideally with the correct &lt;a href=\"bait\"&gt;bait&lt;/a&gt;. Common fish will be caught most often while rare fish and alternative bait are rare catches. Each zone has unique rare fish than can be caught from hotspots. &lt;a href=\"Slaughterfish%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Slaughterfish&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"trodh\"&gt;trodh&lt;/a&gt; can be caught from foul hotspots, &lt;a href=\"dhufish\"&gt;dhufish&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"longfin\"&gt;longfin&lt;/a&gt; can be caught from saltwater hotspots, &lt;a href=\"silverside%20perch\"&gt;silverside perch&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"spadetail\"&gt;spadetail&lt;/a&gt; can be caught from lake hotspots, and &lt;a href=\"Salmon%20%28Online%29\"&gt;salmon&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"River%20Betty%20%28Online%29\"&gt;river betty&lt;/a&gt; can be caught from river hotspots. &lt;a href=\"Chub\"&gt;Chub&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"minnow\"&gt;minnow&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"shad\"&gt;shad&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"fish%20roe\"&gt;fish roe&lt;/a&gt; can be caught and used as bait from foul, saltwater, lake and river hotspots, respectively."}

The &lt;a href=\"War%20of%20Betony\"&gt;War of Betony&lt;/a&gt; (&lt;a href=\"3E%20403\"&gt;3E 403&lt;/a&gt;) was fought over the isle, between the city-states of Daggerfall and &lt;a href=\"Sentinel%20%28Daggerfall%29\"&gt;Sentinel&lt;/a&gt;. Betony is a prosperous fishing isle and is strategically well-placed. It is vulnerable to attacks from the sea, which became a problem in the late &lt;a href=\"Third%20Era\"&gt;Third Era&lt;/a&gt; as piracy grew more and more of a problem in the Illiac Bay. The largest settlement on the isle is &lt;a href=\"Betony%20%28City%29\"&gt;Betony City&lt;/a&gt;. The regional deity is &lt;a href=\"Mara\"&gt;Mara&lt;/a&gt; and the dominant vampire clan is &lt;a href=\"Vraseth%20%28Daggerfall%29\"&gt;Vraseth&lt;/a&gt;.\nPolitical situation.\nPrior to the war, the island was, although officially independent, loosely controlled by the Kingdom of Sentinel. After the war and the defeat of Sentinel the isle became a protectorate of the Kingdom of Daggerfall.\nAt the time of its independence, Betony was ruled over by a Lord or a Lady. The Lord of Betony at the time of the War of Betony was &lt;a href=\"Mogref\"&gt;Mogref&lt;/a&gt;.\nPelagius the Mad.\nA &lt;a href=\"Temple%20of%20Kynareth%20%28Daggerfall%29\"&gt;Temple of Kynareth&lt;/a&gt; on the Isle of Betony was a personal asylum to the Emperor &lt;a href=\"Pelagius%20Septim%20III\"&gt;Pelagius Septim III&lt;/a&gt;\u00a0at the time of his death. He died in his cell at the Temple on his 34th year of ruling after a brief fever.\nAfter Pelagius' death, the Temple he was contained in was destroyed. However, a group known as the &lt;a href=\"Apostles%20of%20Light\"&gt;Apostles of Light&lt;/a&gt; transported each original stone to the\u00a0&lt;a href=\"Shivering%20Isles\"&gt;Shivering Isles&lt;/a&gt;\u00a0where it was reconstructed and renamed\u00a0&lt;a href=\"The%20Howling%20Halls\"&gt;The Howling Halls&lt;/a&gt;. Pelagius' ghost still haunts the Isles to this day.\nFactions.\nOnly the &lt;a href=\"Fighters%20Guild%20%28Daggerfall%29\"&gt;Fighters Guild&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Dark%20Brotherhood%20%28Daggerfall%29\"&gt;Dark Brotherhood&lt;/a&gt; are present on the isle, both of which are located in the city of &lt;a href=\"Whitefort\"&gt;Whitefort&lt;/a&gt;."}

Ulfgar slew the mage, but not before three of his comrades had been turned to stone. They are now the standing stones of Brodir's Grove.

When reading the book, you will learn that Sovngarde is in fact not a physical location, but is where Nords go in the afterlife.\nReturn to Ulfgar with the book. Upon reading it, he will realise he was looking in all the wrong places, and that the answer is so obvious now. He will request that you battle him so that he may die valiantly in battle. If you accept, he will give you some time to prepare. Speak to him again and the battle will begin. With his dying breath, he will tell you to go to Brodir's Grove. Do not forget to loot his corpse. His sword, especially, is worth taking.\nOnce he is dead, head outside to Brodir's Grove. You will notice an extra standing stone has appeared. Ulfgar's ghost will be standing in the middle of the standing stones. Speak to him and he will tell you that he has informed his comrades of your bravery. You can now pray at the each of the standing stones to receive a temporary boost in your attributes."}

When the &lt;a href=\"Vestige\"&gt;Vestige&lt;/a&gt; is done talking to her, an &lt;a href=\"Argonian%20Skeleton\"&gt;Argonian Skeleton&lt;/a&gt; will appear and warn the Vestige that they have come to a very bad place. The Vestige can speak to the skeleton and it will reveal that the skeletons here are slaves to the Admiral, who is building a Coral Tower to reach a portal in the sky. He controls the skeletons using the &lt;a href=\"Crown%20of%20Bones\"&gt;Crown of Bones&lt;/a&gt;, a cursed relic he received from Molag Bal himself. He will mention that the key to reaching the Admiral is in the &lt;a href=\"Journal%20of%20Tsona-Ei%2C%20Part%20Four\"&gt;final part of his journal&lt;/a&gt;, which is hidden in a ship called \"&lt;a href=\"The%20Golden%20Era\"&gt;The Golden Era&lt;/a&gt;\". When the Vestige is done talking to him, a projection of the Admiral will appear and order the skeleton to attack; One-Eye will leap forward and slay the skeleton. \nThe Vestige can speak with One-Eye. She will tell them to meet her at the \"The Golden Era\" located south, just southeast of the map marker. It is the only ship in the area that is still fully intact. In the wharf west of the ship, the Vestige will find the lorebook \"\". East of the ship, is a talking skull called &lt;a href=\"Bosun%20Bones\"&gt;Bosun Bones&lt;/a&gt; that will provide the quest \"&lt;a href=\"Old%20Bones\"&gt;Old Bones&lt;/a&gt;.\" That quest takes place in the same area as this one, so it is efficient to do both simultaneously. Either way, the Vestige can head onto the ship and below deck, and start looking for the journal. The door to the journal's room is on the west side of the room where the Vestige enters. The journal will explain that that many of the skeletons here were sailors from &lt;a href=\"Alten%20Corimont\"&gt;Alten Corimont&lt;/a&gt; and that an old captain of the &lt;a href=\"All%20Flags%20Navy\"&gt;All Flags Navy&lt;/a&gt; is now the Admiral enslaving all the skeletons. There is also a key to the Admiral's quarters hidden within the pages of the journal. \nOnce the Vestige is done reading, One-Eye will enter the room; she will reveal that she has a plan for how to proceed, but that it does not involve the Vestige. The Vestige can either choose to give her the journal or insist that they join her. If the Vestige just gives her the journal, . If the Vestige insists on helping her, she will task them with getting the Crown of Bones that the Admiral uses to control the skeletons while she uses her connections to Alten Corimont to try and break the skeletons free. The key that was found will open the way into a tunnel east of the ship that leads to the Coral Tower. While progressing through this tunnel, a projection of the Admiral will appear and send skeletons to attack the Vestige. At the other end of the cave, the Vestige will find themselves on a path to the Coral Tower. There is a &lt;a href=\"Skyshards%20%28Online%29\"&gt;skyshard&lt;/a&gt; on the side path north of the cave's exit. At the entrance to the tower, the Admiral will taunt the Vestige to come in and be killed. \nThe Vestige can enter the tower, then proceed up the stairs and fight the skeletons. They will find the Crown of Bones on one of their bodies. With it, the Vestige can head back outside and speak with One-Eye. She will suggest that the Vestige either destroy the crown or give it to her. If the Crown is destroyed, it might set the skeletons free, or it might kill them. If the Crown is given to One-Eye, she will try to use it to set the sailors free, but the crown might be cursed and affect her. If the Crown is given to One-Eye, she will transform into a skeleton, but be able to free the others of Molag Bal's influence, becoming their new leader. If the Crown is destroyed, the skeletons will remain under Molag Bal's influence and One-Eye will remain to find another way to free them, saying something about having to use an old shaman's tricks to get a new crew. Either way, the quest will now be complete."}

You want to know about the &lt;a href=\"Glenumbra%20Banks\"&gt;Glenumbra Banks&lt;/a&gt;? I thought everyone knew about those shifting sand bars off the northwest coast of &lt;a href=\"High%20Rock%20%28Online%29\"&gt;High Rock&lt;/a&gt;, the narrow islets that make seafaring there so dangerous close to shore. I myself have made a living for almost thirty years as a &lt;a href=\"Daggerfall%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Daggerfall&lt;/a&gt; pilot, guiding merchant ships through the Banks in and out of the city's &lt;a href=\"Daggerfall%20Docks\"&gt;North Docks&lt;/a&gt;. And I'm well paid for the job, but the merchants don't complain \u2014 they see the rotting spars and twisted planks of the shipwrecks we pass as we wend our way through the channels.\nThose channels are treacherous and ever-changing. When we go out in early &lt;a href=\"Sun%27s%20Dawn\"&gt;Sun's Dawn&lt;/a&gt; to meet the first ship coming in to port after the winter storms, there are always numerous visible changes to the waterways\u2014as well as invisible changes to their depths, which we must take care to map out by frequent use of the plumb-line.\nBut the fact is we must be ever on the lookout for changes in the Banks even in &lt;a href=\"Mid%20Year\"&gt;Mid Year&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Sun%27s%20Height\"&gt;Sun's Height&lt;/a&gt;. Now, how is it that the sands shift the way they do, sometimes changing overnight even when there has been no storm? The &lt;a href=\"Herne%20%28Island%29\"&gt;Herne&lt;/a&gt; Current runs far offshore, and in summer the breeze the mariners call the &lt;a href=\"Yokuda\"&gt;Yokuda&lt;/a&gt;n Zephyr blows steadily but gently from the west.\nAnd yet, the sands shift, and the Banks change.\nWell, stranger, I'll tell you the secret, so long as you're buying the drinks tonight in &lt;a href=\"the%20Rosy%20Lion\"&gt;the Rosy Lion&lt;/a&gt;. It's &lt;a href=\"Ithguleoir\"&gt;Ithguleoir&lt;/a&gt;. Yes, you heard me right\u2014the immortal leviathan of the &lt;a href=\"Eltheric%20Ocean\"&gt;Eltheric Ocean&lt;/a&gt; is no mere fable. Ithguleoir lives, and haunts the far depths of the sea \u2026 and sometimes the near shallows of the shore. He fills old channels in the Banks and dredges new ones. And when a ship runs aground on the sands, he rises from the waters and dines on its sailors, one by one.\nI suppose you're entitled to look skeptical about that\u2014so long as you buy another round, that is. But listen, I'm not just spinning an old salt's yarn. I've seen the thing. On nights when the moons are full and the sea is calm, you can sometimes glimpse the leviathan's oily back heaving above the surface as the old monstrosity digs his devious traps. Occasionally there's a geyser of sea-mist, like when a whale blows, but then the breeze wafts ashore a demonic stench that smells like it's blown from &lt;a href=\"Oblivion%20%28Realm%29\"&gt;Oblivion&lt;/a&gt;.\nSo there: now you know. But let's just keep this between you, me, and the tavernkeeper's cat, shall we? The south harbor's too shallow for the big merchantmen, and Daggerfall depends on her sea-trade continuing to find its way in to the North Docks. As do I. And sailors are such a superstitious lot\u2014no point in scaring them away. Eh?"}

See the lizard who stands on his hindquarters, laboring in the tavern, the field, or the &lt;a href=\"Shadowfen\"&gt;fen&lt;/a&gt; of his homeland? Spot the meek and lowly &lt;a href=\"Argonians%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Argonian&lt;/a&gt; with a simpering guise and a lilting tone of appeasement? He may not be as he seems, friend! After recent incursions close to &lt;a href=\"Black%20Marsh%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Black Marsh&lt;/a&gt;, and the death of &lt;a href=\"Captain%20Turpilinus%20Baibius\"&gt;Captain Turpilinus Baibius&lt;/a&gt; under circumstances most vexing, we have reason to believe &lt;a href=\"Shadowscale\"&gt;Shadowscale&lt;/a&gt;s are active in this region. But what of this clandestine group and its dark purpose?\nShadowscales are reptilian kith born under the sign of &lt;a href=\"the%20Shadow\"&gt;the Shadow&lt;/a&gt;. Plucked at birth and offered to the detestable &lt;a href=\"Dark%20Brotherhood%20%28Online%20Faction%29\"&gt;Dark Brotherhood&lt;/a&gt;, these hatchlings are a boon to their cause and are expertly trained in the arts of furtiveness and subtle bloodshed. When fully formed, they are embraced by these &lt;a href=\"Sithis\"&gt;Sithis&lt;/a&gt; cultists and accept warrants for assassinations, just as their higher race kin have infamously done. Now that Shadowscales are incorporated into Argonian society, their targets benefit only the lizard-folk. How such targets are determined is still unclear.\nIt is believed the Shadowscales follow the identical five tenets of the hated Brotherhood (your Lore Master has the necessary texts to further your education on these matters). Through capture and torture of suspected members, we know that an order is never disobeyed or refused if given by a superior. A fellow Shadowscale is never a target of these cutthroats, and Shadowscales deserting the Brotherhood are hunted and slain. As our dealings with the &lt;a href=\"Morag%20Tong%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Morag Tong&lt;/a&gt; have taught us, an assassin's guild functioning as an adjunct to an official government is a powerful threat: now the Argonians have organized such a force, which must be watched, infiltrated, and utterly confounded until broken."}

Along the way the &lt;a href=\"Last%20Dragonborn\"&gt;Dragonborn&lt;/a&gt; will pass &lt;a href=\"souls\"&gt;souls&lt;/a&gt; sitting or walking about and one of them will begin a dialogue with the Dragonborn and the quest \"&lt;a href=\"Find%20Arvak%27s%20Skull\"&gt;Find Arvak's Skull&lt;/a&gt;\" begins. &lt;a href=\"Boneman%20%28Dawnguard%29\"&gt;Bonemen&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Wrathman%20%28Dawnguard%29\"&gt;Wrathmen&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Mistman\"&gt;Mistmen&lt;/a&gt; might also appear when passing stacks of bones or other structures. When arriving at the ruin, &lt;a href=\"Serana\"&gt;Serana&lt;/a&gt; calls out her mother's name and she walks towards her daughter, behind a barrier that keeps her imprisoned.\nSpeak to Valerica.\nAfter speaking to her daughter, Valerica turns to the Dragonborn and through the dialogue she tells the story about what happened. She also reveals that she has the &lt;a href=\"Elder%20Scroll%20%28Blood%29\"&gt;Elder Scroll&lt;/a&gt; in safe keeping and what needs to be done. To free her the Dragonborn needs to eliminate the &lt;a href=\"Keeper\"&gt;Keeper&lt;/a&gt;s located around the Soul Cairn. Her dialogue also varies based on the Dragonborn's allegiance chosen back during \"&lt;a href=\"Bloodline\"&gt;Bloodline&lt;/a&gt;.\"\nAlternatively, if the Dragonborn has already killed all of the Keepers while exploring the Soul Cairn, Valerica explains what their purpose was and thanks the Dragonborn for lifting the barrier.\nKill the Boneyard Keepers.\nIf the Keepers have not been killed prior to meeting Valerica, follow the markers to the three destinations and kill the three Boneyard Keepers. If the Boneyard Keeper is on top of the structure, the Dragonborn is guided to jump into a soulwell and be transported to the top of the ruin. Once you have killed the keeper on the structure, stand on the soulwell at the top of the stairs to get back down. After all three are killed, return to Valerica to find that the barrier is gone and she is free. She explains what must be done in order to get the Elder Scroll. The Dragonborn must defeat &lt;a href=\"Durnehviir\"&gt;Durnehviir&lt;/a&gt;, a &lt;a href=\"Dragons%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;dragon&lt;/a&gt;.\nDefeat Durnehviir.\nFollow Valerica through the door to the Boneyard. Soon Durnehviir appears and with the help of both Valerica and Serana, defeat the dragon. He will put up a fight and summon help from Bonemen with his unique &lt;a href=\"shout\"&gt;shout&lt;/a&gt;.\nRetrieve Elder Scroll (Blood).\nAfter the dragon is defeated, Valerica shows the Dragonborn where the Elder Scroll is hidden. Exit the Boneyard with Serana and outside Durnehviir is waiting and initiates a conversation where he teaches the &lt;a href=\"Summon%20Durnehviir\"&gt;Summon Durnehviir&lt;/a&gt; shout. He requests the Dragonborn summon him while in &lt;a href=\"Tamriel\"&gt;Tamriel&lt;/a&gt; so that he may see his home once again.\nAt this juncture, if the Dragonborn chose the partially soul-trapped method of entering the Soul Cairn, Valerica will give them instructions on how to find the &lt;a href=\"Soul%20Essence%20Gem\"&gt;Soul Essence Gem&lt;/a&gt; in order to lift the negative effect of missing part of their soul. If the Dragonborn has already found the gem, the effect is dispelled immediately without comment from Valerica or a journal update.\nReturn to Tamriel.\nOnce the Dragonborn and Serana return to Valerica's Study, through the portal, the quest is complete. If one does not want to take the long way again, going to the &lt;a href=\"Castle%20Volkihar%23Castle%20Volkihar%20Balcony\"&gt;Castle Volkihar Balcony&lt;/a&gt; through Valerica's study will allow &lt;a href=\"Fast%20Travel%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;fast travel&lt;/a&gt;."}

Speak with him and he will tell you that the reachmen have attacked &lt;a href=\"Northglen\"&gt;Northglen&lt;/a&gt;. He has sent scouts out to look for any surviving civilians, but only two of them have returned. The soldier he sent out to look for the missing scouts, &lt;a href=\"Isabeth%20Gaercroft\"&gt;Isabeth&lt;/a&gt;, has also not returned; she was last seen entering the chapel. Captain Gaercroft will send you to go look for her. He will give you a potion that both heals and turns the drinker temporarily invisible, so as to help the lost scouts return to the camp.\nHead into town and toward the chapel, but beware of the many Reachmen and zombies you will have to face along the way. On the top floor, you will find an injured &lt;a href=\"Hatmi\"&gt;Hatmi&lt;/a&gt;; talk to her and she will mention she last saw Isabeth rescue a villager and a &lt;a href=\"Wyress\"&gt;Wyress&lt;/a&gt;; she was taking them to the wyress camp in the Ayleid ruins nearby, hoping to form an alliance against the Reachmen. \nYou will find the Ayleid ruin to the northeast; once there, speak with &lt;a href=\"Wyress%20Asteria\"&gt;Wyress Asteria&lt;/a&gt;. She will tell you that they owe Isabeth for saving a wyress, but that the villager they brought along had some sort of disease. Asteria will direct you to speak with &lt;a href=\"Wyress%20Delphique\"&gt;Wyress Delphique&lt;/a&gt; inside the ruins for more information. Head in and speak to Delphique; she will tell you that the villager will go nowhere until she is cured. She has one last rite she can think of to cure her, which she will perform the moment you are done talking. It will kill the villager though; speak with Delphique afterwards and she will tell you the nature of the sickness the villager got; the reachmen were turning her into a zombie. \nWhen asked to form an alliance with the soldiers of Evermore, Delphique will refuse as she does not trust them. In order to win her trust, you must prove that you are on her side by using her runes to wither the Reachmen's markers in the fields, and then cut off the head of their leader &lt;a href=\"Duraeg\"&gt;Duraeg&lt;/a&gt;. Head out of the ruins and south past the town. In the field there, you will see strange root-like things with a green aura about them. These are the markers; use the runes to destroy them. Once the markers are gone, look for Duraeg. He will be in the house in the southeast, in the basement. Kill him, and Isabeth will appear. Follow her outside and talk to her there; she will tell you that Duraeg was trying to turn her into a zombie like the others. She will also tell you that Duraeg has several stashes of the seeds they use for this; you should search the area and destroy them. \nThe seed stores are in the big wooden crates in the fields west of the house. There are four in total; destroy all of them, then head back to the Evermore Camp. You can use the poultice now if you want, to turn invisible so the Reachmen will not attack you. Either way, when you arrive back in camp, you will witness the reunion between Isabeth, Captain Gaercroft and Wyress Delphique. Delphique will use her magic to see whether Isabeth is infected; when it turns out she is, Delphique will demand that the captain kills her or there will be no alliance, but he will refuse to kill his daughter. Speak with Isabeth and she will tell you that she is willing to die for this alliance; after the conversation is over, she will tell Delphique to kill her. Speak with Captain Gaercroft afterwards and he will reluctantly agree to an alliance. This will finish the quest."}

She was reared in all the luxury and security befitting a royal &lt;a href=\"Dunmer\"&gt;Dark Elven&lt;/a&gt; child until she reached five years of age. At that time, His Excellency &lt;a href=\"Tiber%20Septim\"&gt;Tiber Septim&lt;/a&gt;, the first Emperor of &lt;a href=\"Tamriel\"&gt;Tamriel&lt;/a&gt;, demanded that the decadent rulers of Morrowind yield to him and institute imperial reforms. Trusting to their vaunted magic, the Dark Elves impudently refused until Tiber Septim's army was on the borders. An Armistice was hastily signed by the now-eager Dunmer, but not before there were several battles, one of which laid waste to Mournhold, now called &lt;a href=\"Almalexia%20%28City%29\"&gt;Almalexia&lt;/a&gt;.\nLittle Princess Barenziah and her nurse were found among the wreckage. The Imperial &lt;a href=\"General%20Symmachus\"&gt;General Symmachus&lt;/a&gt;, himself a Dark Elf, suggested to Tiber Septim that the child might someday be valuable, and she was therefore placed with a loyal supporter who had recently retired from the Imperial Army.\n&lt;a href=\"Sven%20Advensen\"&gt;Sven Advensen&lt;/a&gt; had been granted the title of Count upon his retirement; his fiefdom, &lt;a href=\"Darkmoor\"&gt;Darkmoor&lt;/a&gt;, was a small town in central &lt;a href=\"Skyrim\"&gt;Skyrim&lt;/a&gt;. Count Sven and his wife reared the princess as their own daughter, seeing to it that she was educated appropriately-and more importantly, that the imperial virtues of obedience, discretion, loyalty, and piety were instilled in the child. In short, she was made fit to take her place as a member of the new ruling class of Morrowind.\nThe girl Barenziah grew in beauty, grace, and intelligence. She was sweet-tempered, a joy to her adoptive parents and their five young sons, who loved her as their elder sister. Other than her appearance, she differed from young girls of her class only in that she had a strong empathy for the woods and fields, and was wont to escape her household duties to wander there at times.\nBarenziah was happy and content until her sixteenth year, when a wicked orphan stable-boy, whom she had befriended out of pity, told her he had overheard a conspiracy between her guardian, Count Sven, and a &lt;a href=\"Redguard\"&gt;Redguard&lt;/a&gt; visitor to sell her as a concubine in &lt;a href=\"Rihad\"&gt;Rihad&lt;/a&gt;, as no &lt;a href=\"Nord\"&gt;Nord&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"Breton\"&gt;Breton&lt;/a&gt; would marry her on account of her black skin, and no Dark Elf would have her because of her foreign upbringing.\n\"Whatever shall I do?\" the poor girl said, weeping and trembling, for she had been brought up in innocence and trust, and it never occurred to her that her friend the stable-boy would lie to her.\nThe wicked boy, who was called &lt;a href=\"Straw%20%28Lore%29\"&gt;Straw&lt;/a&gt;, said that she must run away if she valued her virtue, but that he would come with her as her protector. Sorrowfully, Barenziah agreed to this plan; and that very night, she disguised herself as a boy and the pair escaped to the nearby city of &lt;a href=\"Whiterun\"&gt;Whiterun&lt;/a&gt;. After a few days there, they managed to get jobs as guards for a disreputable &lt;a href=\"merchant\"&gt;merchant&lt;/a&gt; caravan. The caravan was heading east by side roads in a mendacious attempt to elude the lawful tolls charged on the imperial highways. Thus the pair eluded pursuit until they reached the city of &lt;a href=\"Riften\"&gt;Riften&lt;/a&gt;, where they ceased their travels for a time. They felt safe in Riften, close as it was to the Morrowind border so that Dark Elves were enough of a common sight."}

Thanks largely to the benevolence of the Emperor, the child Barenziah was not destroyed with her parents, but reared by Count Sven of &lt;a href=\"Darkmoor\"&gt;Darkmoor&lt;/a&gt;, a loyal &lt;a href=\"Imperial\"&gt;Imperial&lt;/a&gt; trustee. She grew up into a beautiful and pious child, trustful of her guardian's care. This trust, however, was exploited by a wicked orphan stable boy at &lt;a href=\"Sven%20Advensen\"&gt;Count Sven's&lt;/a&gt; estate, who with lies and fabrications tricked her into fleeing Darkmoor with him when she turned sixteen. After many adventures on the road, they settled in &lt;a href=\"Riften\"&gt;Riften&lt;/a&gt;, a &lt;a href=\"Skyrim\"&gt;Skyrim&lt;/a&gt; city near the Morrowind borders.\nThe stable boy, &lt;a href=\"Straw%20%28Lore%29\"&gt;Straw&lt;/a&gt;, was not altogether evil. He loved Barenziah in his own selfish fashion, and deception was the only way he could think of that would cement possession of her. She, of course, felt only friendship toward him, but he was hopeful that she would gradually change her mind. He wanted to buy a small farm and settle down into a comfortable &lt;a href=\"marriage\"&gt;marriage&lt;/a&gt;, but at the time his earnings were barely enough to feed and shelter them.\nAfter only a short time in Riften, Straw fell in with a bold, villainous &lt;a href=\"Khajiit\"&gt;Khajiit&lt;/a&gt; thief named &lt;a href=\"Therris\"&gt;Therris&lt;/a&gt;, who proposed that they rob the Imperial Commandant's house in the central part of the city. Therris said that he had a client, a traitor to the &lt;a href=\"Empire%20of%20Tamriel\"&gt;Empire&lt;/a&gt;, who would pay well for any information they could gather there. Barenziah happened to overhear this plan and was appalled. She stole away from their rooms and walked the streets of Riften in desperation, torn between her loyalty to the Empire and her love for her friends.\nIn the end, loyalty to the Empire prevailed over personal friendship, and she approached the Commandant's house, revealed her true identity, and warned him of her friends' plan. The Commandant listened to her tale, praised her courage, and assured her that no harm would come to her. He was none other than &lt;a href=\"General%20Symmachus\"&gt;General Symmachus&lt;/a&gt;, who had been scouring the countryside in search of her since her disappearance, and had just arrived in Riften, hot in pursuit. He took her into his custody, and informed her that, far from being sent away to be sold, she was to be reinstated as the Queen of Mournhold as soon as she turned eighteen. Until that time, she was to live with the Septim family in the newly built &lt;a href=\"Imperial%20City\"&gt;Imperial City&lt;/a&gt;, where she would learn something of government and be presented at the Imperial Court.\nAt the Imperial City, Barenziah befriended the Emperor Tiber Septim during the middle years of his reign. Tiber's children, particularly his eldest son and heir &lt;a href=\"Pelagius%20Septim\"&gt;Pelagius&lt;/a&gt;, came to love her as a sister. The ballads of the day praised her beauty, chastity, wit, and learning. On her eighteenth birthday, the entire Imperial City turned out to watch her farewell procession preliminary to her return to her native land. Sorrowful as they were at her departure, all knew that she was ready for her glorious destiny as sovereign of the kingdom of Mournhold."}

After several happy months there learning her duties as vassal queen under the Empire, the Imperial &lt;a href=\"General%20Symmachus\"&gt;General Symmachus&lt;/a&gt; escorted her to &lt;a href=\"Mournhold\"&gt;Mournhold&lt;/a&gt; where she took up her duties as Queen of her people under his wise guidance. Gradually they came to love one another and were married and crowned in a splendid ceremony at which the Emperor himself officiated.\nAfter several hundred years of marriage, a son, &lt;a href=\"Helseth%20Hlaalu\"&gt;Helseth&lt;/a&gt;, was born to the royal couple amid celebration and joyous prayer. Although it was not publicly known at the time, it was shortly before this blessed event that the &lt;a href=\"Staff%20of%20Chaos\"&gt;Staff of Chaos&lt;/a&gt; had been stolen from its hiding place deep in the Mournhold mines by a clever, enigmatic bard known only as the &lt;a href=\"Nightingale\"&gt;Nightingale&lt;/a&gt;.\nEight years after Helseth's birth, Barenziah bore a daughter, &lt;a href=\"Morgiah\"&gt;Morgiah&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"Firsthold\"&gt;Firsthold&lt;/a&gt;, named after General &lt;a href=\"Symmachus\"&gt;Symmachus&lt;/a&gt;' mother, and the royal couple's joy seemed complete. Alas, shortly after that, relations with the Empire mysteriously deteriorated, leading to much civil unrest in Mournhold. After fruitless investigations and attempts at reconciliation, in despair Barenziah took her young children and travelled to the Imperial City herself to seek the ear of then Emperor &lt;a href=\"Uriel%20Septim%20VII\"&gt;Uriel Septim VII&lt;/a&gt;. General Symmachus remained in Mournhold to deal with the grumbling peasants and annoyed &lt;a href=\"nobility\"&gt;nobility&lt;/a&gt;, and do what he could to stave off an impending insurrection.\nDuring her audience with the Emperor, Barenziah, through her magical arts, came to realize to her horror and dismay that the so-called Emperor was an impostor, none other than the bard &lt;a href=\"Nightingale\"&gt;Nightingale&lt;/a&gt; who had stolen the &lt;a href=\"Staff%20of%20Chaos\"&gt;Staff of Chaos&lt;/a&gt;. Exercising great self-control she concealed this realization from him. That evening, news came that General Symmachus had fallen in battle with the revolting peasants of Mournhold, and that the kingdom had been taken over by the rebels. Barenziah, at this point, did not know where to seek help, or from whom.\nThe gods, that fateful night, were evidently looking out for her as if in redress of her loss. &lt;a href=\"King%20Eadwyre\"&gt;King Eadwyre&lt;/a&gt;, of &lt;a href=\"High%20Rock\"&gt;High Rock&lt;/a&gt;, an old friend of &lt;a href=\"Uriel%20Septim\"&gt;Uriel Septim&lt;/a&gt; and Symmachus, came by on a social call. He comforted her, pledged his friendship-and furthermore, confirmed her suspicions that the Emperor was indeed a fraud, and none other than &lt;a href=\"Jagar%20Tharn\"&gt;Jagar Tharn&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"Imperial%20Battlemage\"&gt;Imperial Battlemage&lt;/a&gt;, and one of the Nightingale's many alter egos. Tharn had supposedly retired into seclusion from public work and installed his assistant, &lt;a href=\"Ria%20Silmane\"&gt;Ria Silmane&lt;/a&gt;, in his stead. The hapless assistant was later put to death under mysterious circumstances-supposedly a plot implicating her had been uncovered, and she had been summarily executed. However, her ghost had appeared to &lt;a href=\"Eadwyre\"&gt;Eadwyre&lt;/a&gt; in a dream and revealed to him that the true Emperor had been kidnapped by Tharn and imprisoned in an alternate dimension. Tharn had then used the &lt;a href=\"Staff%20of%20Chaos\"&gt;Staff of Chaos&lt;/a&gt; to kill her when she attempted to warn the &lt;a href=\"Elder%20Council\"&gt;Elder Council&lt;/a&gt; of his nefarious plot.\nTogether, Eadwyre and Barenziah plotted to gain the false Emperor's confidence. Meanwhile, another friend of Ria's, known only as the &lt;a href=\"Eternal%20Champion\"&gt;Champion&lt;/a&gt;, who apparently possessed great, albeit then untapped, potential, was incarcerated at the &lt;a href=\"Imperial%20Prison\"&gt;Imperial Dungeons&lt;/a&gt;. However, she had access to his dreams, and she told him to bide his time until she could devise a plan that would effect his escape. Then he could begin on his mission to unmask the impostor.\nBarenziah continued to charm, and eventually befriended, the ersatz Emperor. By contriving to read his secret diary, she learned that he had broken the Staff of Chaos into eight pieces and hidden them in far-flung locations scattered across &lt;a href=\"Tamriel\"&gt;Tamriel&lt;/a&gt;. She managed to obtain a copy of the key to Ria's friend's cell and bribed a guard to leave it there as if by accident. Their Champion, whose name was unknown even to Barenziah and Eadwyre, made his escape through a shift gate Ria had opened in an obscure corner of the Imperial Dungeons using her already failing powers. The Champion was free at last, and almost immediately went to work.\nIt took Barenziah several more months to learn the hiding places of all eight Staff pieces through snatches of overheard conversation and rare glances at Tharn's diary. Once she had the vital information, however -- which she communicated to Ria forthwith, who in turn passed it on to the Champion- she and Eadwyre lost no time. They fled to &lt;a href=\"Wayrest\"&gt;Wayrest&lt;/a&gt;, his ancestral kingdom in the province of &lt;a href=\"High%20Rock\"&gt;High Rock&lt;/a&gt;, where they managed to fend off the sporadic efforts of Tharn's henchmen to haul them back to the &lt;a href=\"Imperial%20City\"&gt;Imperial City&lt;/a&gt;, or at the very least obtain revenge. Tharn, whatever else might be said of him, was no one's fool-save perhaps Barenziah's -- and he concentrated most of his efforts toward tracking down and destroying the Champion.\nAs all now know, the courageous, indefatigable, and forever nameless Champion was successful in reuniting the eight sundered pieces of the Staff of Chaos. With it, he destroyed Tharn and rescued the true Emperor, Uriel Septim VII. Following what has come to be known as the &lt;a href=\"Restoration\"&gt;Restoration&lt;/a&gt;, a grand state memorial service was held for Symmachus at the Imperial City, befitting the man who had served the Septim Dynasty for so long and so well.\nBarenziah and good King Eadwyre had come to care deeply for one another during their trials and adventures, and were married in the same year shortly after their flight from the Imperial City. Her two children from her previous marriage with Symmachus remained with her, and a regent was appointed to rule Mournhold in her absence.\nUp to the present time, Queen Barenziah has been in Wayrest with Prince &lt;a href=\"Helseth%20Hlaalu\"&gt;Helseth&lt;/a&gt; and Princess &lt;a href=\"Morgiah\"&gt;Morgiah&lt;/a&gt;. She plans to return to Mournhold after Eadwyre's death. Since he was already elderly when they wed, she knows that that event, alas, could not be far off as the Elves reckon time. Until then, she shares in the government of the kingdom of Wayrest with her husband, and seems glad and content with her finally quiet, and happily unremarkable, life."}

Born to the &lt;a href=\"Imperial\"&gt;Imperial&lt;/a&gt; Family in the &lt;a href=\"3E%2066\"&gt;sixty-seventh year&lt;/a&gt; of the &lt;a href=\"Third%20Era\"&gt;third era&lt;/a&gt;, Potema was immediately presented to her grandfather, the &lt;a href=\"Emperor\"&gt;Emperor&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Uriel%20Septim%20II\"&gt;Uriel Septim II&lt;/a&gt;, a famously kindhearted man, who viewed the solemn, intense babe and whispered, \u201cShe looks like a she-wolf about ready to pounce.\u201d\nPotema's childhood in the &lt;a href=\"Imperial%20City\"&gt;Imperial City&lt;/a&gt; was certainly difficult from the start. Her father, Prince &lt;a href=\"Pelagius%20Septim%20II\"&gt;Pelagius Septim&lt;/a&gt;, and her mother, &lt;a href=\"Qizara\"&gt;Qizara&lt;/a&gt;, showed little affection for their brood. Her eldest brother Antiochus, sixteen at Potema's birth, was already a drunkard and womanizer, infamous in the empire. Her younger brothers &lt;a href=\"Cephorus%20Septim\"&gt;Cephorus&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Magnus%20Septim\"&gt;Magnus&lt;/a&gt; were born much later, so for years she was the only child in the Imperial Court.\nBy the age of 14, Potema was a famous beauty with many suitors, but she was married to cement relations with King &lt;a href=\"Mantiarco\"&gt;Mantiarco&lt;/a&gt; of the &lt;a href=\"Nord\"&gt;Nord&lt;/a&gt;ic kingdom of Solitude. She entered the court, it was said, as a pawn, but she quickly became a queen. The elderly King Mantiarco loved her and allowed her all the power she wished, which was total.\nWhen Uriel Septim II died the following year, her father was made emperor, and he faced a greatly depleted treasury, thanks to his father's poor management. Pelagius Septim dismissed the &lt;a href=\"Elder%20Council\"&gt;Elder Council&lt;/a&gt;, forcing them to buy back their positions. In &lt;a href=\"3E%2097\"&gt;3E 97&lt;/a&gt;, after many miscarriages, the Queen of Solitude gave birth to a son, who she named Uriel after her grandfather. Mantiarco quickly made Uriel his heir, but the Queen had much larger ambitions for her child.\nTwo years later, Pelagius Septim died \u2014 many say poisoned by a vengeful former Council member \u2014 and his son, Potema's brother Antiochus took the throne. At age forty-eight, it could be said that &lt;a href=\"Antiochus%20Septim\"&gt;Antiochus's&lt;/a&gt; wild seeds had yet to be sown, and the history books are nearly pornographic in their depictions of life at the Imperial court during the years of his reign. Potema, whose passion was for power not fornication, was scandalized every time she visited the Imperial City.\nMantiarco, King of Solitude, died the springtide after Pelagius Septim. Uriel ascended to the throne, ruling jointly with his mother. Doubtless, Uriel had the right and would have preferred to rule alone, but Potema convinced him that his position was only temporary. He would have the Empire, not merely the kingdom. In &lt;a href=\"Castle%20Solitude\"&gt;Castle Solitude&lt;/a&gt;, she entertained dozens of diplomats from other kingdoms of Skyrim, sowing seeds of discontent. Her guest list over the years expanded to include kings and queens of &lt;a href=\"High%20Rock\"&gt;High Rock&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Morrowind\"&gt;Morrowind&lt;/a&gt; as well.\nFor thirteen years, Antiochus ruled &lt;a href=\"Tamriel\"&gt;Tamriel&lt;/a&gt;, and proved an able leader despite his moral laxity. Several historians point to proof that Potema cast the spell that ended her brother's life, but evidence one way or another is lost in the sands of time. In any event, both she and her son Uriel were visiting the Imperial court in &lt;a href=\"3E%20112\"&gt;3E 112&lt;/a&gt; when Antiochus died, and immediately challenged the rule of his daughter and heir, &lt;a href=\"Kintyra%20II\"&gt;Kintyra&lt;/a&gt;.\nPotema's speech to the Elder Council is perhaps helpful to students of public speaking.\nShe began with flattery and self-abasement: \u201cMy most august and wise friends, members of the Elder Council, I am but a provincial queen, and I can only assume to bring to issue what you yourselves must have already pondered.\u201d\nShe continued on to praise the late Emperor, who was a popular ruler in spite of his flaws: \u201cHe was a true Septim and a great warrior, destroying \u2014 with your counsel \u2014 the near invincible armada of &lt;a href=\"Pyandonea\"&gt;Pyandonea&lt;/a&gt;.\u201d\nBut little time was wasted, before she came to her point: \u201cThe Empress Magna unfortunately did nothing to temper my brother's lustful spirits. In point of fact, no whore in the slums of the city spread out on more beds than she. Had she attended to her duties in the Imperial bedchamber more faithfully, we would have a true heir to the Empire, not the halfwit, milksop bastards who call themselves the Emperor's children. The girl called Kintyra is popularly believed to be the daughter of Magna and the Captain of the Guard. It may be that she is the daughter of Magna and the boy who cleans the cistern. We can never know for certain. Not as certainly as we can know the lineage of my son, Uriel. The last of the Septim Dynasty.\u201d\nDespite Potema's eloquence, the Elder Council allowed Kintyra to assume the throne as the Empress Kintyra II. Potema and Uriel angrily returned to Skyrim and began assembling the rebellion.\nDetails of the &lt;a href=\"War%20of%20the%20Red%20Diamond\"&gt;War of the Red Diamond&lt;/a&gt; are included in other histories: we need not recount the Empress Kintyra II's capture and eventual execution in High Rock in the year &lt;a href=\"3E%20114\"&gt;3E 114&lt;/a&gt;, nor the ascension of Potema's son, &lt;a href=\"Uriel%20III\"&gt;Uriel III&lt;/a&gt;, seven years later. Her surviving brothers, Cephorus and Magnus, fought the Emperor and his mother for years, tearing the Empire apart in a civil war.\nWhen Uriel III fought his uncle Cephorus in Hammerfell at the &lt;a href=\"Battle%20of%20Ichidag\"&gt;Battle of Ichidag&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"3E%20127\"&gt;3E 127&lt;/a&gt;, Potema was fighting her other brother, Uriel's uncle Magnus in Skyrim at the &lt;a href=\"Battle%20of%20Falconstar\"&gt;Battle of Falconstar&lt;/a&gt;. She received word of her son's defeat and capture just as she was preparing to mount an attack on Magnus's weakest flank. The sixty-one-year-old Wolf Queen flew into a rage and led the assault herself. It was a success, and Magnus and his army fled. In the midst of the victory celebration, Potema heard the news that her son the Emperor had been killed by an angry mob before he had even made it for trial in the Imperial City. He had been burned to death within his carriage.\nWhen Cephorus was proclaimed Emperor, Potema's fury was terrible to behold. She summoned daedra to fight for her, had her necromancers resurrect her fallen enemies as undead warriors, and mounted attack after attack on the forces of the Emperor Cephorus I. Her allies began leaving her as her madness grew, and her only companions were the zombies and skeletons she had amassed over the years. The kingdom of Solitude became a land of death. Stories of the ancient Wolf Queen being waited on by rotting skeletal chambermaids and holding war plans with vampiric generals terrified her subjects.\nPotema died after a month long siege on her castle in the year &lt;a href=\"3E%20137\"&gt;3E 137&lt;/a&gt; at the age of . While she lived, she had been the Wolf Queen of Solitude, Daughter of the Emperor Pelagius Septim, Wife of King Mantiarco, Aunt of the Empress Kintyra II, Mother of Emperor Uriel III, and Sister of the Emperors Antiochus and Cephorus. Three years after her death, died, and his \u2014 and Potema's \u2014 brother Magnus took the throne.\nHer death has hardly diminished her notoriety. Though there is little direct evidence of this, some theologians maintain that her spirit was so strong, she became a daedra after her death, inspiring mortals to mad ambition and treason. It is also said that her madness so infused Castle Solitude that it infected the next king to rule there. Ironically, that was her 18-year-old nephew &lt;a href=\"Pelagius%20Septim%20III\"&gt;Pelagius&lt;/a&gt;, the son of Magnus. Whatever the truth of the legend, it is undeniable that when Pelagius left Solitude in &lt;a href=\"3E%20145\"&gt;3E 145&lt;/a&gt; to assume the title of the Emperor Pelagius Septim III, he quickly became known as Pelagius The Mad. It is even widely rumored that he murdered his father Magnus.\nThe Wolf Queen must surely have had the last laugh."}

Just when I had given up all hope, I found what may be the greatest discovery in the history of our society.\nYesterday, I was traversing a particularly remote area of the Wrothgarian mountains when I heard the distant chirping of a blue bunting. I thought I must be imagining things, but I decided I had no choice but to investigate.\nAs I followed the bunting's call, I began to hear other varieties of bird calls, and soon I traced the sounds to a &lt;a href=\"Coldperch%20Cavern\"&gt;desolate cave&lt;/a&gt;. Just looking into the mouth of the cave, I can already see blue buntings, canaries, cardinals, and even a green jay. Never before have I seen so many different birds living in the same habitat.\nTomorrow I will venture deeper into the cave. Who knows what I might find? I think this might be the most excited I've been in my entire life."}

At this point, the &lt;a href=\"Gold%20Coast%20Trading%20Company%20%28Faction%29\"&gt;Gold Coast Trading Company&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"Anvil\"&gt;Anvil&lt;/a&gt; made an agreement with &lt;a href=\"House%20Hlaalu\"&gt;House Hlaalu&lt;/a&gt; to build a settlement in Vvardenfell to keep the business going on in the Bitter Coast. This settlement later became known as &lt;a href=\"Seyda%20Neen\"&gt;Seyda Neen&lt;/a&gt; and it garnered traction throughout the Bitter Coast and the nearby &lt;a href=\"Ascadian%20Isles\"&gt;Ascadian Isles&lt;/a&gt;.\nSlavers had appeared throughout the Bitter Coast and had taken the island of &lt;a href=\"Firemoth\"&gt;Firemoth&lt;/a&gt; as their base of operations. A slave ship crashed on the shores of the Bitter Coast, and someone put out the fire at the &lt;a href=\"Seyda%20Neen%20Lighthouse\"&gt;Grand Pharos Lighthouse&lt;/a&gt;, prompting a search by the Seyda Neen coastguard and &lt;a href=\"Deminah%20Salvi\"&gt;Deminah Salvi&lt;/a&gt;, Deputy Governor of Seyda Neen. It was revealed that &lt;a href=\"Governor%20Omellian\"&gt;Governor Omellian&lt;/a&gt; was in league with the slavers and after a botched job, he ordered a &lt;a href=\"Morag%20Tong\"&gt;Morag Tong&lt;/a&gt; agent to assassinate the leader of the slavers, &lt;a href=\"Captain%20Svadstar\"&gt;Captain Svadstar&lt;/a&gt;. Svadstar was murdered in &lt;a href=\"Firemoth\"&gt;Firemoth&lt;/a&gt;, but Omellian was arrested and taken to &lt;a href=\"Vivec%20City\"&gt;Vivec City&lt;/a&gt; for trial.\nAround this time, the &lt;a href=\"Alliance%20War\"&gt;Alliance War&lt;/a&gt; ravaged &lt;a href=\"Tamriel\"&gt;Tamriel&lt;/a&gt; and hit locations from Stonefalls to &lt;a href=\"Auridon\"&gt;Auridon&lt;/a&gt;. In the early years of &lt;a href=\"2E%20582\"&gt;2E 582&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"Daggerfall%20Covenant\"&gt;Daggerfall Covenant&lt;/a&gt; launched a campaign throughout Stonefalls and destroyed many settlements such as &lt;a href=\"Davon%27s%20Watch\"&gt;Davon's Watch&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Fort%20Virak\"&gt;Fort Virak&lt;/a&gt;. The Covenant committed atrocities in Stonefalls by attacking innocent and neutral territories, one of the Covenant's most pristine warriors, &lt;a href=\"Khartag\"&gt;General Khartag&lt;/a&gt; went AWOL from the Covenant and fled to the northern Bitter Coast to form a group of Orcish Smugglers called the &lt;a href=\"Ropefish%20%28Faction%29\"&gt;Ropefish&lt;/a&gt;. The Ropefish was infamous in Vvardenfell because they freed slaves from all across the region. The &lt;a href=\"Camonna%20Tong\"&gt;Camonna Tong&lt;/a&gt; syndicate began to take notice and offered Khartag a deal where Slave Smuggling would become a cruel business rather than helping the less fortunate. Khartag went against the contract and disrespected the Camonna Tong. This caused the Camonna Tong to raid their &lt;a href=\"Khartag%20Point\"&gt;hideout&lt;/a&gt; and subsequently killed Khartag. Khartag's operation did not die with him. However, the Ropefish continued to smuggle slaves out of &lt;a href=\"Morrowind\"&gt;Morrowind&lt;/a&gt;.\nVvardenfell's Bitter Coast is known for their unfertile land that makes it relatively hard to live. Tropical flora such as &lt;a href=\"Moon%20Sugar\"&gt;Moon Sugar&lt;/a&gt; cannot be grown in places such as the Vvardenfell &lt;a href=\"Grazelands\"&gt;Grazelands&lt;/a&gt; or the &lt;a href=\"Deshaan%20Plain\"&gt;Deshaan Grazelands&lt;/a&gt; but rather in places such as the &lt;a href=\"Tenmar%20Forest\"&gt;Tenmar Forest&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"Khenarthi%27s%20Roost\"&gt;Khenarthi's Roost&lt;/a&gt;. A &lt;a href=\"Khajiit\"&gt;Khajiit&lt;/a&gt; known as &lt;a href=\"Halinjirr\"&gt;Halinjirr&lt;/a&gt; discovered a cave in the Bitter Coast called &lt;a href=\"Zainsipilu\"&gt;Zainsipilu&lt;/a&gt; had the perfect climate to grow Moon Sugarcane and was under the Hlaalu radar. Halinjirr's exploits were soon heard from local bandits and eventually House Hlaalu themselves. Whether his Moon-Sugar crops were destroyed or not is unknown.\n&lt;a href=\"Third%20Era\"&gt;Third Era&lt;/a&gt;.\nBy &lt;a href=\"3E%20427\"&gt;3E 427&lt;/a&gt;, more settlements began to spring up on the Bitter Coast such as &lt;a href=\"Gnaar%20Mok\"&gt;Gnaar Mok&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Hla%20Oad\"&gt;Hla Oad&lt;/a&gt;. These settlements, however, were struggling to stay afloat due to consistently paying high taxes to the smugglers and due to the swamps slowly swallowing these ransacked towns to the ground. The Camonna Tong has prominent power in the region and is seen on the western edge of the Bitter Coast near the villages of Gnaar Mok and Hla Oad. The &lt;a href=\"Blight\"&gt;Blight&lt;/a&gt; was released onto Vvardenfell in the same year, and this disease has affected various settlements including the three on the Bitter Coast."}

The poor and witless cannot survive long. Luckily, this one is not witless. Many days I scouted the city, searching for means to rebuild my fortunes. An inattentive, overconfident merchant would serve nicely. I, Zabia-ko, found one at the Spotless Goods Shipping Concern.\nThrough hard work, soon this one could afford a cart, a &lt;a href=\"Guar%20%28Online%29\"&gt;guar&lt;/a&gt; (named Little Bazrag, for his stubbornness), passage to the &lt;a href=\"Gold%20Coast%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Gold Coast&lt;/a&gt;, and some crates of exotics to trade. Zabia-ko's promise to her father would be met! She would return to her childhood village, pockets fat with gold, sacks of coffee, and bags of Mistral moon-sugar, prized for its fruity aftertaste.\nBut tragedy befell Zabia-ko on the road from &lt;a href=\"Anvil%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Anvil&lt;/a&gt; to &lt;a href=\"Kvatch%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Kvatch&lt;/a&gt;. After selling a sleeve of &lt;a href=\"Horker%20%28Online%29\"&gt;horker&lt;/a&gt; summer sausage to workers at a dig site, they invited her to rest for the night at the edge of their camp.\nSleep could not have held this one long when the ground shook, followed by much shouting. The workers scattered, running every direction like field mice during a game of This One Caught Many. Little Bazrag refused to wake, so Zabia-ko hid.\nThat's when we saw them. Tiny creatures, no taller than the lip of this one's boot, with buzzing wings. As they chased one of the workers from his bedroll, he shrieked \"&lt;a href=\"nixad\"&gt;nixad&lt;/a&gt;!\" before plummeting over the lip and breaking his leg. The little beasts giggled and taunted him as he moaned in pain.\nNearby, Zabia-ko heard high-pitched grunting. She spotted one with a pouch of gold hanging from its sharp claws. It did not seem that it should fly under such weight, but its wings flapped furiously, successfully fleeing with its prize. The other raised its arms over its head, ready to strike at a bag of the &lt;a href=\"Mistral\"&gt;Mistral&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"moon-sugar\"&gt;moon-sugar&lt;/a&gt;. It dove in headfirst, legs and wings protruding from the bag, as it happily ate its weight.\nThis one grabbed the thief by the legs and pulled it from the sack. It thumped my head and giggled wickedly. As it buzzed away, it left a trail of sugar in its wake. This one gave chase, but lost it in the darkness. During the struggle, Zabia-ko failed to notice the other nixad plunge face-first in the moon-sugar bags.\nBy the time she returned, Zabia-ko found empty sacks. All that remained were three dead nixad inside, overstuffed with moon-sugar. Even Little Bazrag had wandered off.\nOnce more I lost my goods! Prized Mistral moon-sugar\u2014such a loss, wasted on filthy, wicked creatures. As for the coffee? Completely untouched.\nZabia-ko learned much that night. First: should you lose your Mistral moon-sugar to nixad, roast them afterward. Their sweetened meat leaves a tingling, fruity aftertaste on the tongue.\nSecond: When traveling through nixad-infested lands, surround your moon-sugar with bags of coffee. The bitter scent should drive them away, making your journey all the sweeter."}

His reign ended in &lt;a href=\"1E%20980\"&gt;1E 980&lt;/a&gt;, when he was slain at the hands of his enemies, marking the end of the 30-year &lt;a href=\"Siege%20of%20Orsinium\"&gt;Siege of Orsinium&lt;/a&gt;. He was often described as being a zealot over the &lt;a href=\"Daedric%20Prince\"&gt;Daedric Prince&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Malacath\"&gt;Malacath&lt;/a&gt;.\nHistory.\nGolkarr belonged to &lt;a href=\"Clan%20Igrun\"&gt;Clan Igrun&lt;/a&gt;, and was crowned the King of &lt;a href=\"Orsinium\"&gt;Orsinium&lt;/a&gt; after &lt;a href=\"Torug%20gro-Igron\"&gt;Torug gro-Igron&lt;/a&gt;'s reign ended. Golkarr publicly praised the &lt;a href=\"Bjoulsae%20Raids\"&gt;raids&lt;/a&gt; that occurred along the &lt;a href=\"Bjoulsae%20River\"&gt;Bjoulsae River&lt;/a&gt;, committed by &lt;a href=\"Clan%20Bagrakh\"&gt;Clan Bagrakh&lt;/a&gt;. It is said the raids where done in the name of Clan Igrun, and some sources claim he made demands from the &lt;a href=\"Bretons\"&gt;Bretons&lt;/a&gt; living there. In &lt;a href=\"1E%20948\"&gt;1E 948&lt;/a&gt;, King &lt;a href=\"Joile\"&gt;Joile&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"Daggerfall\"&gt;Daggerfall&lt;/a&gt; sent a letter to &lt;a href=\"Gaiden%20Shinji\"&gt;Gaiden Shinji&lt;/a&gt; regarding the effects of the raids on &lt;a href=\"Wayrest\"&gt;Wayrest&lt;/a&gt;.\n&lt;a href=\"Siege%20of%20Orsinium\"&gt;Siege of Orsinium&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe Siege of Orsinium began in &lt;a href=\"1E%20950\"&gt;1E 950&lt;/a&gt;, with the armies of Daggerfall and &lt;a href=\"Sentinel\"&gt;Sentinel&lt;/a&gt;, as well as the &lt;a href=\"Order%20of%20Diagna\"&gt;Order of Diagna&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Knights%20of%20the%20Dragon\"&gt;Knights of the Dragon&lt;/a&gt;, allied against Orsinium. Golkarr was allied with the Orcish clans of Igrun, Bagrakh, &lt;a href=\"Clan%20Morkul\"&gt;Morkul&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Clan%20Tumnosh\"&gt;Tumnosh&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Clan%20Shatul\"&gt;Shatul&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Clan%20Fharun\"&gt;Fharun&lt;/a&gt;, and later the &lt;a href=\"Savage%20Sons\"&gt;Savage Sons&lt;/a&gt;, who defended Orsinium.\nThe Siege lasted for thirty years, with the three gates designed by Torug to defend the city proving to be very effective, as it took Orsinium's enemies 10 years to break each one. Golkarr resided in &lt;a href=\"High%20Scarp%20Keep\"&gt;High Scarp Keep&lt;/a&gt;, the castle of Orsinium. The shaman &lt;a href=\"Zbulgat%20the%20Wild-Walker\"&gt;Zbulgat the Wild-Walker&lt;/a&gt; gifted Golkarr the artifact known as the &lt;a href=\"Horn%20of%20Beasts%20%28Item%29\"&gt;Horn of Beasts&lt;/a&gt;, instructing him to never use it more than once per cycle of the moons. Golkarr used the horn to summon hundreds of wild creatures to defend the city, which had a significant impact during the early years of the siege. The horn later cracked when he used thrice during a single moon cycle, rendering it unusable.\nDeath.\nWhen the opposing armies finally broke through the last gate in &lt;a href=\"1E%20980\"&gt;1E 980&lt;/a&gt;, Golkarr prayed to &lt;a href=\"Mauloch\"&gt;Mauloch&lt;/a&gt; for strength in &lt;a href=\"Grudgement%20Hall\"&gt;Grudgement Hall&lt;/a&gt;, shortly before being killed. It is claimed that King Joile and Gaiden Shinji slew him, however, both Shinji and Joile died before or during &lt;a href=\"1E%20973\"&gt;1E 973&lt;/a&gt;."}

He asks the &lt;a href=\"Last%20Dragonborn\"&gt;Dragonborn&lt;/a&gt; to find his aunt, &lt;a href=\"Agna\"&gt;Agna&lt;/a&gt;, who ventured further into the tomb in Golldir's stead.\nAs the Dragonborn and Golldir make their way through the tomb, Agna is discovered, deceased. He will become slightly annoyed if the Dragonborn takes treasures from the tomb, but allows it, as the Dragonborn is helping him stop Vals Veran.\nAfter clearing the tomb, the Dragonborn ends up in a chamber with Vals Veran, and his &lt;a href=\"Draugr%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;draugr&lt;/a&gt; army. If the Dragonborn is successful in protecting Golldir, he rewards them with coins and the key to the Hillgrund chest. Golldir returns to his aunt and will be ready to aid the Dragonborn as a &lt;a href=\"Followers%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;follower&lt;/a&gt;, as long as he survives the quest with the Dragonborn.\nDialogue.\n&lt;a href=\"Ancestral%20Worship\"&gt;Ancestral Worship&lt;/a&gt;.\n\"Ah! Oh, by Kyne you startled me. There's a necromancer around here so watch yourself.\"\n\"Can you help me?

Talos, why didn't I go in with her? He's barred the door. Gods only know how he's... defiling the bodies of my ancestors in there! Agna once told me there is a secret room deeper in where they buried disgraced members of the family. Maybe that will get us into the main chamber...\"\nNear the pressure plate:\n\"Careful, there's a pressure plate around here. I've triggered it before and got pelted with darts.\"\nNear the secret passage:\n\"This looks like the area Agna told me about. She said that the bear would show the way...\"\n\"You've found it! The passage goes through the sarcophagus... I don't like this... but we'd better keep going.\"\nNear the main burial chamber:\n\"Okay, I think this door should lead to the main burial chamber where Vals is holed up. Let's get in there and put an end to this.\"\nAfter defeating Vals:\n\"Thank you for your help with Vals. Please, take this and leave me to see to Aunt Agna and my other family members.\"\n\"I have things I should see to, but go ahead.\"\nConversations.\nVals \"The dead should be made to serve the living, not the other way around!\"\"\nGolldir \"I'll return my ancestors to Sovngarde, and you with them!\"\"\nVals \"Sovngarde is a myth, you s'wit! And now you can join your ancestors in service to me.\"\"\nFollower.\nGolldir is a warrior who specializes in heavy armor, block, and one-handed weapons (seemingly so since he starts off with a one handed axe when one first recruits him). He will use two-handed weapons as well, although his skill level is lower than his one-handed. He can also be recruited into the Blades.\nIf he can't be asked to follow, the Dragonborn should leave the tomb and he will be standing outside. The Dragonborn can then ask him to join.\nBy default, Golldir wears a full set of &lt;a href=\"Iron%20Armor%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;iron armor&lt;/a&gt;, excluding the helm.\nIf the Dragonborn steals a &lt;a href=\"Horse%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;horse&lt;/a&gt;, Golldir will be dismissed due to his morality being set to \"no stealing,\" however the Dragonborn can still steal objects without this happening."}

Once asked, she will respond by saying that the rumors of the disappearances have been exaggerated, and that the administration has a handle on the situation. She will then tell the Vestige to speak to Justice Istah if they wish to work. Istah can be found across the entrance to the Hall of Judgement.\nOnce spoken to, he will explain that he had overheard the conversation with Sulma, and will disagree on the situation being under the administration's control. He will then ask the Vestige to assist him. In order to help, the Vestige must spy on the Crowns and the Forebears in order to find out what the situation is. They will be required to wear disguises corresponding to each faction in order to remain undetected. Istah will direct the Vestige specifically to &lt;a href=\"Ra%20Gada%27s%20Respite\"&gt;Ra Gada's Respite&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"A%27tor%27s%20Oasis\"&gt;A'tor's Oasis&lt;/a&gt; in the investigations.\nCouncilman: \"Regardless of what he's told you, Magistrate, Istah and his bailiffs have made no progress in their investigation.\"\nMagistrate Sulma: \"Honestly, I'm more worried about the Withered Hand than these disappearances, Councilman. We just have to give Istah more time.\"\nCouncilman: \"I don't know. Bailiff Fakimal\u2014the one who lives at the northwest edge of town\u2014I heard he was ignoring evidence in the case.\"\nMagistrate Sulma: \"We can't believe everything we hear. You have my word though, if necessary, I will deal with Istah.\"\nZarala: \"The person behind the disappearances is definitely a Crown. No doubt about it.\"\nHifa: \"Now that's low, even for you. How could you possibly know that?\"\nZarala: \"Because there were shreds of a Crown dishdasha left at one of the crime scenes.\"\nHifa: \"Are the bailiffs covering that up? This is the first I've heard of it.\"\nAmahnin: \"Our brother Istah has not visited the fellowship house much of late.\"\nInila: \"No, but one of the bailiffs was here. Believe it or not, the guards almost didn't let him in.\"\nAmahnin: \"Truly? What possible reason would the guards have for keeping out a bailiff?\"\nInila: \"His Crown dishdasha was all shredded up. I suppose it happened when he arrested someone. I just gave him a new one.\"\nAfter listening to each rumor, the Vestige will need to investigate Bailiff Fakimal's house. Upon entering, he will be found dead. Around the house are multiple clues; these consist of a key, a weapon, and a &lt;a href=\"Fakimal%27s%20Letter\"&gt;letter&lt;/a&gt; containing orders. Once all of the clues are collected, Istah will need to be spoken to again. However, he has also been put into the stocks by Sulma for obstructing investigation and conspiring against the citizens of Bergama.\nIstah will tell the Vestige that he has found evidence of Sulma meeting secretly with Fakimal. Once he inquired her of it, he was put into the stocks. After telling him about the clues found, he will say that the only people who have power to give orders to him and Fakimal is the Magistrate, and that the key must belong to Sulma. The Vestige will then be asked to investigate her house, southwest of the Hall of Judgement, for clues.\nUpon searching the basement, one will find that it is littered with skeletons. A &lt;a href=\"Note%20from%20Alasan\"&gt;Note from Alasan&lt;/a&gt; will reveal that Sulma was dealing with the &lt;a href=\"Withered%20Hand\"&gt;Withered Hand&lt;/a&gt;, who's currency is in corpses. Without this deal, the Withered Hand would take and kill citizens from the town instead.\nAfterwards, &lt;a href=\"Withered%20Hand%20Cultist\"&gt;Withered Hand Cultist&lt;/a&gt;s will appear and attack the Vestige. After they have been defeated, one must return with the evidence and confront Sulma of her actions. The Vestige can then chose to turn her in for her crimes or keep her secret.\nIf she is turned in, Istah can be found released from the stocks after he had convinced the other Bailiffs to free him. He will reward the Vestige with a &lt;a href=\"leveled\"&gt;leveled&lt;/a&gt; amount of and a Justice Longbow."}

In &lt;a href=\"2E%20566\"&gt;2E 566&lt;/a&gt;, House Mornard lost their holdings on High Isle as a result of their house's support of &lt;a href=\"King%20Ranser\"&gt;King Ranser&lt;/a&gt; in his &lt;a href=\"King%20Ranser%27s%20War\"&gt;eponymous war&lt;/a&gt; against &lt;a href=\"High%20King%20Emeric%20%28Online%29\"&gt;High King Emeric&lt;/a&gt;.

The monk, named Quaranir, has informed me that the \"Eye of Magnus\" is dangerous and that to learn how to deal with it, I need to speak with The Augur of Dunlain within the College. I should ask my fellow members where to find him.\"\nWalkthrough.\nTolfdir has returned from Saarthal, and with the help of the &lt;a href=\"Savos%20Aren\"&gt;Arch-Mage&lt;/a&gt;, has moved the giant floating orb of crackling energy into the &lt;a href=\"Hall%20of%20the%20Elements\"&gt;Hall of the Elements&lt;/a&gt;. Tolfdir can be found nearby, studying it. He can be asked if he has any lower-priority tasks to be completed (beginning any of the College's additional quests). The &lt;a href=\"Last%20Dragonborn\"&gt;Dragonborn&lt;/a&gt; can also tell him that &lt;a href=\"Urag%20gro-Shub\"&gt;Urag gro-Shub&lt;/a&gt; suggested coming to see him and that a book was found entitled \"&lt;a href=\"Night%20of%20Tears%20%28Book%29\"&gt;Night of Tears&lt;/a&gt;\". He says that he will have to read it, but that he is having difficulty tearing himself away from the beauty of the orb, called the &lt;a href=\"Eye%20of%20Magnus\"&gt;Eye of Magnus&lt;/a&gt;. If permitted, he will make a few observations. He observes that the markings are quite unlike anything he has seen before; not even &lt;a href=\"Falmer%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Falmer&lt;/a&gt; runes are a match. The object is also radiating &lt;a href=\"Magicka%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Magicka&lt;/a&gt;, and this has caused the Arch-Mage to fully commit to researching the orb.\nTolfdir is about to continue when he is interrupted by &lt;a href=\"Ancano%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Ancano&lt;/a&gt;. Tolfdir reluctantly agrees to let the Dragonborn leave with Ancano, who has important information to impart. Ancano says that someone from the &lt;a href=\"Psijic%20Order\"&gt;Psijic Order&lt;/a&gt; has appeared at the College and is asking for the Dragonborn by name. He can be questioned further.\nThe quest continues by following him out of the Hall of the Elements and into the &lt;a href=\"Arch-Mage%27s%20Quarters%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Arch-Mage's Quarters&lt;/a&gt;. There, a cloaked figure resembling the Psijic Monk, that was encountered during the quest \"&lt;a href=\"Under%20Saarthal\"&gt;Under Saarthal&lt;/a&gt;,\" appears again as time pauses for everyone around. He introduces himself as &lt;a href=\"Quaranir\"&gt;Quaranir&lt;/a&gt;.\nAccording to Quaranir, the longer the Eye remains in the College, the more dangerous the situation becomes. They expect dire consequences if the Eye is not banished, but the future is obscure, and the Psijic Order is unsure how the Dragonborn must act. Seeking out the &lt;a href=\"Augur%20of%20Dunlain\"&gt;Augur of Dunlain&lt;/a&gt; is the next logical step. The monk disappears as the effect of his presence dissipates, Ancano and Savos Aren return to normal.\nAugur of Dunlain.\nAncano is furious at the Psijic Order's interruption and vows to get to the bottom of this matter.\nLooking for answers.\nBefore searching for the Augur, it is possible to gain a little more information about the Augur by asking the College's inhabitants about it:\nThe Midden.\nWhen Tolfdir is asked about the Augur of Dunlain, he will say it has been years since he has spoken with him. The Augur is down in &lt;a href=\"The%20Midden\"&gt;The Midden&lt;/a&gt;. The Midden may be accessed by a trap door on the floor of the &lt;a href=\"Hall%20of%20Countenance\"&gt;Hall of Countenance&lt;/a&gt;, hidden under the stairs, or through another trapdoor on the north-west side of the College's main courtyard, near the entrance to the Hall of Elements.\nThe underground system of ancient tunnels known as the Midden runs beneath the College. It consists of a series of passages, stairs and small rooms. The remains of several experiments or rituals are scattered around. A &lt;a href=\"Draugr%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Draugr&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Skeleton%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Skeletons&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Frostbite%20Spider%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Frostbite Spiders&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Ice%20Wraith%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Ice Wraiths&lt;/a&gt; roam these gloomy corridors.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Atronach%20Forge\"&gt;Atronach Forge&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Forgotten%20Names\"&gt;Daedric Relic&lt;/a&gt; can be found while searching The Midden. Near the Forge is an entrance to The Midden Dark, where the quest continues.\nThe Midden Dark.\nAs the frozen bridge is crossed, the Dragonborn begins to hear the voice of the Augur, echoing through the tunnels. He says that there is nothing for the Dragonborn here and that perseverance will only lead to disappointment. The sealed door to the Augur's chamber is locked. Trying it will cause the Augur to let the Dragonborn into his oubliette.\nThe Augur explains it is too late to change. It also says that the Dragonborn is not the only one who has visited the Augur recently, and that the Thalmor, Ancano, has been here too.\nThinking that Ancano was simply here to strengthen his own hand, the Augur neglected to tell him that the Eye of Magnus is extremely dangerous, and a staff of great power is required to mitigate this threat. The &lt;a href=\"Staff%20of%20Magnus%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Staff of Magnus&lt;/a&gt; needs to be found.\nThe Dragonborn must now return to Savos Aren, who is probably near the Eye of Magnus. Upon telling him that there is important information which he needs to hear, he initially scoffs at the request to find the Staff of Magnus, but after the Dragonborn mentions who gave this information, he is impressed by the Dragonborn's initiative and requests that they should locate the staff. He then adds that Mirabelle Ervine mentioned something about the staff, but it was a while ago. The Dragonborn is given the &lt;a href=\"Mage%27s%20Circlet\"&gt;Mage's Circlet&lt;/a&gt; as a reward and the quest ends and the next quest,\u00a0\"&lt;a href=\"Revealing%20the%20Unseen%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Revealing the Unseen&lt;/a&gt;,\" begins."}

I have made my decision. The other night I had a terrible dream. I had lived my whole life working as a stablehand here at &lt;a href=\"Aswala%20Stables\"&gt;Aswala Stables&lt;/a&gt;, and as I lay on my deathbed, I realized my mistake. &lt;a href=\"Tamriel\"&gt;Tamriel&lt;/a&gt; is enormous, filled with exciting people and exciting places, all of which, in the dream, I had missed.\nAs you know, mother, my friend Najan disappeared several months ago. I did not wish to worry you, so I did not tell you the truth. Najan joined the cult known as the &lt;a href=\"Withered%20Hand\"&gt;Withered Hand&lt;/a&gt;. At the time, I thought him a madman, but he recently returned in the night and told me of his experience. Though there is much grisly work involved, and I know that grandfather, and even you may condemn me for dishonoring myself, a career of raising the dead seems to be very exciting.\nNajan says he was taken to &lt;a href=\"Satakalaam%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Satakalaam&lt;/a&gt; for training. They taught him the arts of war, the arts of &lt;a href=\"Necromancy\"&gt;Necromancy&lt;/a&gt;, and the many other valuable skills. They have given him a wardrobe full of silken robes, and he says that they have even promised to take him to the city of &lt;a href=\"Wayrest%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Wayrest&lt;/a&gt; someday. Najan has invited me to join the Hand, and I have decided I cannot pass up this opportunity.\nI will always love you mother. I hope you will forgive me.

Gorne is a natural paradise with lush flora and an abundant harvest that &lt;a href=\"House%20Indoril\"&gt;House Indoril&lt;/a&gt; has utilized for centuries. It is dominated by the &lt;a href=\"Diodata\"&gt;Diodata&lt;/a&gt; clan in remote areas, who have the ability to see through the eyes of others.\nGeography.\nGorne is located on the eastern coast of Morrowind, in the &lt;a href=\"Indoril%20District\"&gt;Indoril District&lt;/a&gt; of Morrowind and near the city of &lt;a href=\"Necrom\"&gt;Necrom&lt;/a&gt;, though its exact location is unknown. The island itself is unique when compared to the rest of Eastern Morrowind. There is a unique race of animals referred to as \"bat lizards,\" which may be a distant cousin to the &lt;a href=\"Cliff%20Racer\"&gt;Cliff Racer&lt;/a&gt; or the &lt;a href=\"Cliff%20Strider\"&gt;Cliff Strider&lt;/a&gt;. The flora of Gorne resembles the foliage in places such as &lt;a href=\"Stonefalls\"&gt;Stonefalls&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Bal%20Foyen\"&gt;Bal Foyen&lt;/a&gt;, the flora came in shades of blue, purple, pink, and ash green. The only known settlement in the island is the township of &lt;a href=\"Gorne%20%28Village%29\"&gt;Gorne&lt;/a&gt;.

Gorne was one of the many landmarks discovered by Topal when he traveled all over Morrowind, having found the Modern-Day &lt;a href=\"Fiefdom%20of%20Anticlere\"&gt;Fiefdom of Anticlere&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;a href=\"Iliac%20Bay\"&gt;Iliac Bay&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Niben%20River\"&gt;Niben River&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;a href=\"Nibenay\"&gt;Nibenay&lt;/a&gt; region of &lt;a href=\"Cyrodiil\"&gt;Cyrodiil&lt;/a&gt;.

The two were stuck in a deadlock, and as such, by Imperial custom, it was decided that a duel had to be held. Gortwog was granted the right to decide the arms and armor, whereas Lord Bowyn had the right to choose the location. While both also had the right to choose a Champion to fight in their stead, both chose to fight themselves. Despite some training in the armor, Lord Bowyn stood no chance against Gortwog, and was beaten in combat, providing Gortwog with the legal rights to the land.\n&lt;a href=\"War%20of%20Betony\"&gt;War of Betony&lt;/a&gt;.\nWhile the Orsimer were originally not involved in the War of Betony in &lt;a href=\"3E%20402\"&gt;3E 402&lt;/a&gt;, they were involved in clashes with Wayrest over access to the Bjoulsae River.\nLater on during the War of Betony, the Orcs of King Gortwog were said to have been sent out to block a group of Wayrest Scouts from reaching the encamptment of &lt;a href=\"King%20Lysandus\"&gt;King Lysandus&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"Daggerfall\"&gt;Daggerfall&lt;/a&gt;. While most of the scouts were blocked by the Orcs, some made it through, and are implied to have murdered the King in his tent. Specifically &lt;a href=\"Lord%20Woodborne\"&gt;Lord Woodborne&lt;/a&gt; was stated to have murdered King Lysandus. Likewise, Gortwog's forces were slain by the Wayrest assassins. Other reports attribute the Orsimer for the death of Lysandus, however.\nThe Emperor also sent out a letter to Queen &lt;a href=\"Mynisera\"&gt;Mynisera&lt;/a&gt; of Daggerfall during the conflict, but due to the passing of King Lysandus during the war, the letter was delivered to &lt;a href=\"Aubk%27i\"&gt;Aubk'i&lt;/a&gt; instead. The letter detailed the fact that Lord Woodborne had gained possession of the Totem of Tiber Septim, which would later find its way to the treasury of Castle Daggerfall.\n&lt;a href=\"The%20Warp%20in%20the%20West\"&gt;The Warp in the West&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Thieves%20Guild\"&gt;Thieves Guild&lt;/a&gt; later stole the Emepror's letter, and fenced it to King Gortwog. When Mynisera discovered this, she desired the letter from Gortwog, and as such, offered to put in a good word with the Empire should Gortwog help her get the letter. Gortwog, however, no longer cared for the letter, and allowed the &lt;a href=\"The%20Agent\"&gt;Agent&lt;/a&gt; to retrieve it from Orsinium if he could do so without finding death.\nGortwog would later contact the Agent once more, upon learning of his possession of the &lt;a href=\"Totem%20of%20Tiber%20Septim\"&gt;Totem of Tiber Septim&lt;/a&gt;. In a letter addressed to the Agent, Gortwog detailed how his people were treated like barbarians and slaughtered on sight, to which the Orcs only respond in kind. Gortwog explained how he desired to raise the status of the Orsimer to that of the other races of Tamriel, providing them with a homeland, and that to do so he needed the Totem. When Gortwog was provided the Totem, he was grateful as it provided his people with a chance at freedom. Gortwog also promised a far greater reward to the Agent should they find and bring the &lt;a href=\"Mantella\"&gt;Mantella&lt;/a&gt; to him.\nWhen the &lt;a href=\"Numidium\"&gt;Numidium&lt;/a&gt; was activated, in &lt;a href=\"3E%20417\"&gt;3E 417&lt;/a&gt; the Kingdoms of &lt;a href=\"Daggerfall\"&gt;Daggerfall&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Wayrest\"&gt;Wayrest&lt;/a&gt; and Orsinium had been involved in a three-way clash, causing a great fire to occur in the forests of &lt;a href=\"Daenia\"&gt;Daenia&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Illessan%20Hills\"&gt;Illessan Hills&lt;/a&gt;, which would spread north into &lt;a href=\"Ykalon\"&gt;Ykalon&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Phygias\"&gt;Phygias&lt;/a&gt;. Orsinium's forces were likewise actively engaging the forces of Wayrest in the territory of what had once been &lt;a href=\"Gauvadon\"&gt;Gauvadon&lt;/a&gt;. By the end of the conflict, 20 years after the Warp in the West had occurred, Gortwog had managed to claim much of the Wrothgarian Mountains, while also claiming the coast of the &lt;a href=\"Bjoulsae%20River\"&gt;Bjoulsae River&lt;/a&gt;. With Orsinium's solidified power, Gortwog requested the Elder Council recognize Orsinium as an Imperial province seperate from High Rock. While the Elder Council did treat Gortwog as a sovereign king, and collected taxes directly from Orsinium directly, formally the land was still considered a county of High Rock, despite spanning both High Rock and Hammerfell.\nThe Kingdom of Wayrest, after the conflict, created an alliance between itself and Orsinium after the miracle of peace, under the rule of Queen &lt;a href=\"Elysana\"&gt;Elysana&lt;/a&gt;. Gortwog also sent out adventurers into the other provinces to seek riches and treasures to have Orsinium gain the respect of all of &lt;a href=\"Tamriel\"&gt;Tamriel&lt;/a&gt;. Many Orcs also signed on with the &lt;a href=\"Imperial%20Legion\"&gt;Imperial Legion&lt;/a&gt;, earning themselves Imperial citizenship.\nFollowing Orsinium's official formation, Necromancers had a keen eye on the corpses of &lt;a href=\"Orc\"&gt;Orc&lt;/a&gt;s, due to the durability of their skin and the strength in their bones. King Gortwog, despite offerings of defense against hostiles, was unwilling to answer requests to use said corpses in necromancy.\n&lt;a href=\"Fourth%20Era\"&gt;Fourth Era&lt;/a&gt;.\nDuring the Fourth Era, Orsinium was sacked once again, with the survivors being largely brought to Skyrim by the aid of the &lt;a href=\"Seventh%20Legion\"&gt;Seventh&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Fifteenth%20Legion\"&gt;Fifteenth Legion&lt;/a&gt;. Orsinium was later rebuilt in the mountains between Hammerfell and Skyrim. It is unknown if Gortwog survived the sack of Orsinium."}

Since his ascension to the throne, he has worked hard to make his people be accepted as citizens of the &lt;a href=\"Empire\"&gt;Empire&lt;/a&gt;. He is also strongly against &lt;a href=\"Necromancy\"&gt;Necromancy&lt;/a&gt;.\nBiography.\nIn &lt;a href=\"3E%20399\"&gt;3E 399&lt;/a&gt;, he managed to win the &lt;a href=\"Orsinium%20Area\"&gt;Orsinium Area&lt;/a&gt; after a duel with Lord &lt;a href=\"Bowyn\"&gt;Bowyn&lt;/a&gt;, with the help of an Orc named &lt;a href=\"Tunner\"&gt;Tunner&lt;/a&gt;. After he gained the area, slowly but surely he learned how to play the game of politics cleverly. He managed to retrieve a copy of the Real Barenziah, a book that was critical of the royal family of &lt;a href=\"Wayrest%20%28Daggerfall%29\"&gt;Daggerfall&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Septim%20bloodline\"&gt;Septim bloodline&lt;/a&gt;.\nDuring the &lt;a href=\"War%20for%20Betony\"&gt;War for Betony&lt;/a&gt;, through his spies, he found out that Wayrest was sending assassins to assassinate King &lt;a href=\"Lysandus\"&gt;Lysandus&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"Daggerfall%20%28City%29\"&gt;Daggerfall&lt;/a&gt;. He thought that by preventing this he could gain the friendship of the most powerful kingdom in the &lt;a href=\"Iliac%20Bay\"&gt;Iliac Bay&lt;/a&gt; region and also the &lt;a href=\"Direnni%20Clan\"&gt;Direnni Clan&lt;/a&gt; on the &lt;a href=\"Isle%20of%20Balfiera%20%28Daggerfall%29\"&gt;Isle of Balfiera&lt;/a&gt;. Unfortunately, his warriors could not stop the assassins and King Lysandus was slain.\nHe also gained the letter that &lt;a href=\"Uriel%20Septim%20VII\"&gt;Uriel Septim VII&lt;/a&gt; sent to the Queen of Daggerfall. The letter was critical, as it stated the resurfacing of the &lt;a href=\"Numidium\"&gt;Numidium&lt;/a&gt;, a &lt;a href=\"Dwemer\"&gt;Dwemer&lt;/a&gt; construct. The letter was finally retrieved from Gortwog by an agent of Uriel Septim VII in the depths of the dungeon of Orsinium, but the contents of the letter had already been spreading among the rulers of the Iliac Bay region and the underground factions as well. It was obvious that Gortwog had traded this information.\nNumidium.\nGortwog is one of the wielders of the Dwemer weapon Numidium. He is one of the seven retrievers of the &lt;a href=\"Totem%20of%20Tiber%20Septim\"&gt;Totem of Tiber Septim&lt;/a&gt;, a tool for controlling the Dwemer construct. Originally there was only one Totem, but a strange time-warping effect known as the &lt;a href=\"Warp%20in%20the%20West\"&gt;Warp in the West&lt;/a&gt; made all seven parties of the Iliac Bay receive the Totem.\nThrough the use of the Totem, Gortwog eventually got the Empire to accept the Orcs as equally as other races. Because of Gortwog, Orcs now enjoy all the privileges of normal &lt;a href=\"Imperial\"&gt;Imperial&lt;/a&gt; citizens, and some have been accepted as guards in the City Watches and soldiers in the &lt;a href=\"Imperial%20Legion\"&gt;Imperial Legion&lt;/a&gt;.\nInteractions.\n&lt;a href=\"Orcish%20Emancipation\"&gt;Orcish Emancipation&lt;/a&gt;.\nGortwog sieges the &lt;a href=\"Uriel%20Septim%20VII\"&gt;Emperor's&lt;/a&gt; letter, which was meant for &lt;a href=\"Mynisera\"&gt;Queen Mynisera&lt;/a&gt;. Hence, &lt;a href=\"the%20Agent\"&gt;the Agent&lt;/a&gt; is sent to retrieve the letter from Gortwog.\n&lt;a href=\"The%20Mantella%20Revealed\"&gt;The Mantella Revealed&lt;/a&gt;.\nIf the Hero has enough reputation with Gortwog, they will receive an anonymous letter from him, which provides information on the &lt;a href=\"Numidium\"&gt;Numidium&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"Totem%20of%20Tiber%20Septim\"&gt;Totem of Tiber Septim&lt;/a&gt;, and the &lt;a href=\"Mantellan%20Crux\"&gt;Mantellan Crux&lt;/a&gt;.\n&lt;a href=\"Barenziah%27s%20Book\"&gt;Barenziah's Book&lt;/a&gt;.\nGortwog will ask &lt;a href=\"the%20Agent\"&gt;the Agent&lt;/a&gt; to bring the lost chapter of Barenziah's book to him, instead of taking it back to &lt;a href=\"Barenziah%20%28Daggerfall%29\"&gt;Barenziah&lt;/a&gt;.

His father, &lt;a href=\"Lysandus%20of%20Daggerfall\"&gt;Lysandus of Daggerfall&lt;/a&gt;, was killed at the end of the &lt;a href=\"War%20for%20Betony\"&gt;War for Betony&lt;/a&gt;. His wife is &lt;a href=\"Aubk%27i\"&gt;Aubk'i&lt;/a&gt;, former princess of Sentinel. His mother is &lt;a href=\"Mynisera\"&gt;Mynisera&lt;/a&gt; and his grandmother is &lt;a href=\"Nulfaga\"&gt;Nulfaga&lt;/a&gt;.\nHistory.\nDuring the War for Betony, right after the death of Lysandus, he took over command of the Daggerfall army. He managed to slay the King of &lt;a href=\"Sentinel%20%28Daggerfall%29\"&gt;Sentinel&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Camaron%20of%20Sentinel\"&gt;Camaron of Sentinel&lt;/a&gt;, forcing the army of Sentinel to retreat and subsequently surrender. After some negotiation, he asked for the hand of Aubk'i in marriage, obviously a hostage of war.\nKing Gothryd is one of the wielders of the &lt;a href=\"Numidium\"&gt;Numidium&lt;/a&gt;. He was one of the seven retrievers of the Totem of &lt;a href=\"Tiber%20Septim\"&gt;Tiber Septim&lt;/a&gt;, a tool for controlling the &lt;a href=\"Dwemer\"&gt;Dwemer&lt;/a&gt;i construct. Originally there was only one Totem, but a strange time warping effect known as the &lt;a href=\"Warp%20in%20the%20West\"&gt;Warp in the West&lt;/a&gt; made all seven parties in the &lt;a href=\"Iliac%20Bay\"&gt;Iliac Bay&lt;/a&gt; region receive the Totem.\nInteractions.\n&lt;a href=\"Lysandus%27%20Revenge\"&gt;Lysandus' Revenge&lt;/a&gt;.\nGothryd can be handed over \"&lt;a href=\"Lord%20Woodborne%27s%20Private%20Journal%20VII\"&gt;Lord Woodborne's Private Journal VII&lt;/a&gt;\". Doing so, however, does not result in quest completion, and grants no rewards. As Gothryd happens to be an ally to &lt;a href=\"Lord%20Woodborne\"&gt;Lord Woodborne&lt;/a&gt;, he will instead order his minions to kill the &lt;a href=\"The%20Agent\"&gt;Hero&lt;/a&gt;, if the journal is delivered to him.\n&lt;a href=\"Totem%2C%20Totem%2C%20Who%20Gets%20the%20Totem%3F\"&gt;Totem, Totem, Who Gets the Totem?&lt;/a&gt;.\nGothryd is one of the potential buyers for the &lt;a href=\"Totem%20of%20Tiber%20Septim\"&gt;Totem of Tiber Septim&lt;/a&gt;. He will reward the player with 10,000 gold if the Totem is brought to him directly, instead of given to his mercenaries.\n&lt;a href=\"Journey%20to%20Aetherius\"&gt;Journey to Aetherius&lt;/a&gt;.\nIf the Totem of Tiber Septim was given to Gothryd, he uses the power of the Numidium to help the kingdom of &lt;a href=\"Daggerfall%20%28Region%29\"&gt;Daggerfall&lt;/a&gt; secure full control over the &lt;a href=\"Illiac%20Bay\"&gt;Illiac Bay&lt;/a&gt;.\nDialogue.\n\"You were completely correct to bring this to me.

Located atop a hill north of the town center, its design is typical of western &lt;a href=\"Imperials%20%28Morrowind%29\"&gt;Imperial&lt;/a&gt; architecture and resembles a small fort, complete with five towers. It serves as a gathering place for local members of &lt;a href=\"House%20Hlaalu\"&gt;House Hlaalu&lt;/a&gt; and it is home to a number of service providers.\nDescription.\nThrough an archway at the top of the exterior stairs there are three doors leading inside. A desk greets visitors who enter through the main door and &lt;a href=\"Cunius%20Pelelius\"&gt;Cunius Pelelius&lt;/a&gt;, a charter-holder and principal of the &lt;a href=\"Caldera%20Mine\"&gt;Caldera Mine&lt;/a&gt;, is standing nearby. To the right of the entry is a shelving unit containing decorative silverware and three small chests on the bottom shelf. The unlocked chest to the left contains a variety of &lt;a href=\"Alchemy%20%28Morrowind%29\"&gt;alchemy&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Ingredients%20%28Morrowind%29\"&gt;ingredients&lt;/a&gt;. The remaining two are both locked (&lt;a href=\"Lock%20Level\"&gt;level&lt;/a&gt; 35) and contain fifty &lt;a href=\"Septim%20%28Coin%29\"&gt;gold&lt;/a&gt; each. An &lt;a href=\"Assassin%20%28Morrowind%29\"&gt;assassin&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Foves%20Arenim\"&gt;Foves Arenim&lt;/a&gt;, and a &lt;a href=\"Nightblade%20%28Morrowind%29\"&gt;nightblade&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Llaros%20Uvayn\"&gt;Llaros Uvayn&lt;/a&gt;, wander the ground floor offering their services for a fee.\nThe two spiral staircases nearest the entrance on the east and west sides of the building lead to a second-floor hallway connecting two towers. &lt;a href=\"Olumba%20gro-Boglar\"&gt;Olumba gro-Boglar&lt;/a&gt; wanders the hall, otherwise there is nothing of interest here. The staircases continue up to the tower summits, but are void of people, items, and doors.\nThe two spiral staircases furthest from the entrance lead to a private area of the second floor, consisting of two rooms that serve as &lt;a href=\"Odral%20Helvi\"&gt;Odral Helvi&lt;/a&gt;'s living quarters. Odral is found in the eastern room, a long and narrow space with a bed, table, and an unlocked closet containing expensive &lt;a href=\"Clothing%20%28Morrowind%29\"&gt;clothing&lt;/a&gt;. Other than Odral himself, there is little of interest here.\nThe western room contains another bed, Odral's closet and his chest. The closet is locked (level 65) and contains an &lt;a href=\"Amulet%20of%20Mighty%20Blows\"&gt;Amulet of Mighty Blows&lt;/a&gt; along with common clothing. On top of the closet is a small chest that may be difficult to see without jumping. It contains a random quantity of gold and is locked (level 35) and trapped with a &lt;a href=\"Hand%20of%20Sleep%20%28Morrowind%29\"&gt;Hand of Sleep&lt;/a&gt; trap. Next to the closet is Odral's chest. It is locked (level 40) and trapped with a &lt;a href=\"Misfortunate%20Touch\"&gt;Misfortunate Touch&lt;/a&gt; trap, but can also be opened with Odral's key. It contains a unique set of the \"&lt;a href=\"Brief%20History%20of%20the%20Empire\"&gt;Brief History of the Empire&lt;/a&gt;\" books, family heirlooms bound in gold. A &lt;a href=\"Secret%20Caldera%20Ledger\"&gt;ledger&lt;/a&gt; revealing details of underhanded activities at the mines is also found within.\nThe central staircase is not connected to the building's second floor. At the summit there are a number of barrels, baskets, and crates containing a variety of items, including a couple of &lt;a href=\"Leveled%20Items%20%28Morrowind%29\"&gt;leveled&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Weapons%20%28Morrowind%29\"&gt;weapons&lt;/a&gt; and several pieces of &lt;a href=\"Steel%20Armor%20%28Morrowind%29\"&gt;steel armor&lt;/a&gt;.\nQuests.\n&lt;a href=\"Books%20for%20Vala\"&gt;Books for Vala&lt;/a&gt;.\n&lt;a href=\"Gentleman%20Jim%20Stacey%20%28Morrowind%29\"&gt;Gentleman Jim Stacey&lt;/a&gt; of the &lt;a href=\"Thieves%20Guild%20%28Morrowind%29\"&gt;Thieves Guild&lt;/a&gt; requests that the &lt;a href=\"Nerevarine\"&gt;Nerevarine&lt;/a&gt; relieve Odral Helvi of his prized unique editions of \"A Brief History of the Empire\". He states, \"It is not just the charity that is important, but stealing from the unjust.\" The books are to be donated in the name of &lt;a href=\"Bal%20Molagmer\"&gt;Bal Molagmer&lt;/a&gt; to a school operated by &lt;a href=\"Vala%20Catraso\"&gt;Vala Catraso&lt;/a&gt;.\n&lt;a href=\"Donation%20from%20Cunius%20Pelelius\"&gt;Donation from Cunius Pelelius&lt;/a&gt;.\n&lt;a href=\"Iulus%20Truptor\"&gt;Iulus Truptor&lt;/a&gt; of the &lt;a href=\"Imperial%20Cult\"&gt;Imperial Cult&lt;/a&gt; is having trouble collecting a donation of five-hundred gold pledged to the \"Widows and Orphans Fund\". Cunius refuses to fulfill his obligation, but can be blackmailed to do it with &lt;a href=\"Secret%20Caldera%20Ledger\"&gt;evidence of corruption&lt;/a&gt; found at Governor's Hall.\n&lt;a href=\"Erroneous%20Documents\"&gt;Erroneous Documents&lt;/a&gt;.\nOdral Helvi would like the Nerevarine to travel to the &lt;a href=\"Hlaalu%20Records\"&gt;Hlaalu Records&lt;/a&gt; building in &lt;a href=\"Vivec%20City%20%28Morrowind%29\"&gt;Vivec City&lt;/a&gt; with a \"corrected\" land deed, and quietly swap it with the original.\n&lt;a href=\"Rent%20and%20Taxes\"&gt;Rent and Taxes&lt;/a&gt;.\nOdral instructs Nerevarine to collect fifty drakes owed by two farmers in the &lt;a href=\"Ascadian%20Isles%20%28Morrowind%29\"&gt;Ascadian Isles&lt;/a&gt; region, or kill them if they refuse to pay. His true motives become clear upon return, collecting the gold results in a loss of &lt;a href=\"disposition\"&gt;disposition&lt;/a&gt; while slaying the farmers results in an increase.\n&lt;a href=\"Sealed%20Orders%20%28Morrowind%29\"&gt;Sealed Orders&lt;/a&gt;.\nOdral has some &lt;a href=\"Treasury%20Orders\"&gt;orders&lt;/a&gt; to be delivered to the &lt;a href=\"Hlaalu%20Treasury\"&gt;Hlaalu Treasury&lt;/a&gt; in Vivec. His instructions specify that they are not to be read, and must be handed over to an &lt;a href=\"Tenisi%20Lladri\"&gt;assistant clerk&lt;/a&gt; rather than the &lt;a href=\"Baren%20Alen\"&gt;head of the treasury&lt;/a&gt;.\n&lt;a href=\"Shipment%20of%20Ebony\"&gt;Shipment of Ebony&lt;/a&gt;.\nOdral instructs the Nerevarine to deliver five pieces of &lt;a href=\"Raw%20Ebony\"&gt;raw ebony&lt;/a&gt; to &lt;a href=\"Drinar%20Varyon\"&gt;Drinar Varyon&lt;/a&gt;, a known smuggler. Odral says that, \"He will deliver them to... friends of mine on the mainland.\"\n&lt;a href=\"Shut%20the%20Mines%20Down\"&gt;Shut the Mines Down&lt;/a&gt;.\n&lt;a href=\"Garisa%20Llethri\"&gt;Garisa Llethri&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"House%20Redoran\"&gt;House Redoran&lt;/a&gt; wants the Caldera mine shut down due to growing concerns over corruption. Although he prefers that the &lt;a href=\"Slavery\"&gt;slaves&lt;/a&gt; be organized for a revolt, or simply freed, this can also be performed by slaughtering Odral Helvi at Governor's Hall, and &lt;a href=\"Stlennius%20Vibato\"&gt;Stlennius Vibato&lt;/a&gt; at the &lt;a href=\"Mining%20Company%20Office\"&gt;Mining Company Office&lt;/a&gt;.\n&lt;a href=\"The%20Caldera%20Spy\"&gt;The Caldera Spy&lt;/a&gt;.\nOdral requests that the Nerevarine recover contracts stolen from the Caldera mine, and kill whoever is responsible for the theft. Once discovering the thief's &lt;a href=\"Elmussa%20Damori\"&gt;identity&lt;/a&gt;, the Nerevarine can convince her to hand over the documents peacefully, or execute her."}

Your people deserve so much greater than you.\"\nQuintus Jarol: \"My lord and lady, please! We have a more pressing concern and it affects us all!\"\nFortunata ap Dugal: \"Careful, Quintus. I won't be spoken to in such a manner. But you're right. The Dark Brotherhood grows stronger and threatens everything we've built here.\"\nQuintus Jarol: \"I forgot to mention. Primate Artorius sends his regrets, but Cathedral business forced him to remain in Kvatch. He indicates that he will support whatever we decide.\"\nFortunata ap Dugal: \"I rule Anvil with an iron glove, but you let that glorified priest walk all over Kvatch, Count Carolus.\"\nCarolus Aquilarios: \"I govern while Artorius handles spiritual matters and the Cathedral's defenders, the Order of the Hour. I've allowed them to patrol Kvatch until the murderer is apprehended.\"\nQuintus Jarol: \"Haven't the last few murder victims been suspected members of the Dark Brotherhood? Perhaps if we do nothing, this murderer will solve our problem for us.\"\nCarolus Aquilarios: \"I refuse to allow a vigilante to freely stalk the streets of my city. That's why I allowed Artorius to expand the Order of the Hour's authority.\"\nFortunata ap Dugal: \"If I didn't know any better, I'd think you and Artorius were building an army. Should I be worried, my dear Count?\"\nQuintus Jarol: \"Count Carolus, can we at least get your assurance that the Order will return to the Cathedral once this threat is resolved?\"\nCarolus Aquilarios: \"Primate Artorius gave me his word, and I give you mine.\"\nFortunata ap Dugal: \"And why should I trust either of them, Quintus? What good is their word when I find the Order at Anvil's walls.\"\nCarolus Aquilarios: \"That won't happen, Fortunata.

We'll find the intruders.\"\nFortunata will later escape out of the estate with Carolus.\n&lt;a href=\"A%20Special%20Request\"&gt;A Special Request&lt;/a&gt;.\nFortunata is later met at &lt;a href=\"Anvil%20Castle%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Anvil Castle&lt;/a&gt;, as she has contacted the &lt;a href=\"Dark%20Brotherhood%20%28Online%20Faction%29\"&gt;Dark Brotherhood&lt;/a&gt; for a contract. She tasks you with assassinating &lt;a href=\"Commander%20Marcus%20Scipio\"&gt;Commander Marcus Scipio&lt;/a&gt;, and to inform Count Carolus of your accomplishment. In a twist of events, Carolus is unexpectedly performing the &lt;a href=\"Black%20Sacrament\"&gt;Black Sacrament&lt;/a&gt;. He mistakes you for the assassin sent to answer his deal, and tells you to assassinate Fortunata. &lt;a href=\"Speaker%20Terenus%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Speaker Terenus&lt;/a&gt; enters the room, being the actual assassin who is answering to Carolus, and sends you to kill Fortunata while he negotiates with Carolus.\nBack at Anvil Castle, fellow assassin &lt;a href=\"Mirabelle%20Motierre\"&gt;Mirabelle Motierre&lt;/a&gt; is in character for her disguise as one of Fortunata's hand-maidens. She recommends poisoning Fortunata's favorite wine decanter, as the governor is known to make a toast for celebratory occasions. After going to Fortunata's suite, she says \"\"How in &lt;a href=\"Oblivion%20%28Realm%29\"&gt;Oblivion&lt;/a&gt;'s bleakness did &lt;a href=\"Vestige\"&gt;you&lt;/a&gt; get in here? No, don't tell me. I don't really want to know your trade secrets.\" Once you have told her of Scipio's death, she says \"Fetch my wine, &lt;a href=\"Edwina%20%28Gold%20Coast%29\"&gt;girl&lt;/a&gt;. You know the one. And bring something \u2026 less expensive for my friend here.\"\" She then goes to the balcony, where she requests to meet you. At the balcony, &lt;a href=\"Mirabelle%20Motierre\"&gt;Mirabelle Motierre&lt;/a&gt; appears and has the follow exchange with Fortunata:\nGovernor Fortunata ap Dugal: \"Ah, I miss sailing the open sea. Things were more clear out there. Kill or be killed. Take whatever you can carry. Fight to keep what's yours.It's the same here, I suppose. We're just less honest about it.\"\n&lt;a href=\"Mirabelle%20Motierre\"&gt;Mirabelle Motierre&lt;/a&gt;: \"Your wine, Governor.\"\nFortunata ap Dugal: \"Mirabelle? What are you doing here?\"\nMirabelle Motierre: \"You know how clumsy Edwina can be, Governor. While she cleans up her mess, I brought your wine so you wouldn't be kept waiting.\"\nFortunata ap Dugal: \"Initiative. I like that in a serving girl.Very well, then. A toast! To taking what you can and fighting to keep what's yours.The wine... what did you do?\"\nMirabelle Motierre: \"\"We'll drink to your memory, Governor. And to the glory of the &lt;a href=\"Night%20Mother\"&gt;Night Mother&lt;/a&gt;.\"\"\nFortunata ap Dugal: \"Mirabelle? She's one of \u2026 you?\"\nMirabelle Motierre: \"\"Life is fleeting, Fortunata. An illusion. And in the end, everything belongs to &lt;a href=\"Sithis\"&gt;Sithis&lt;/a&gt;. Tell him I said hello.\"\"\nFortunata ap Dugal: \"&lt;Falls off the ledge to her death&gt;\"\nMirabelle Motierre: \"I'll see you back at the Sanctuary, darling.

It is a sublocation of the &lt;a href=\"Forgotten%20Vale\"&gt;Forgotten Vale&lt;/a&gt;, and is part of the &lt;a href=\"Chantry%20of%20Auri-El\"&gt;Chantry of Auri-El&lt;/a&gt;.\nExterior.\nThe Inner Sanctum is located just past the &lt;a href=\"Wayshrine%20of%20Radiance\"&gt;Wayshrine of Radiance&lt;/a&gt;. It is a large, Elven inspired building that appears to be made out of a white marble or similar stone, with large ornate gold windows.\nTo the west of the main entrance is an arch. Hopping over the railing and going through the arch leads to a prominence. Here there is a skeleton half-buried in the rock wearing an unremovable circlet that has three gems precariously placed on it and an elven sword below that. Further on, there is a large golden statue of &lt;a href=\"Auri-El\"&gt;Auri-El&lt;/a&gt; in the courtyard.\nTo gain access to the interior, the Dragonborn must have visited all of the &lt;a href=\"Wayshrines%20%28Dawnguard%29\"&gt;wayshrines&lt;/a&gt; and filled the &lt;a href=\"initiate%27s%20ewer\"&gt;initiate's ewer&lt;/a&gt; during &lt;a href=\"Touching%20the%20Sky%20%28Quest%29\"&gt;Touching the Sky&lt;/a&gt;. Upon doing so, the Ewer is then emptied into a basin near the door which then flows towards the main door and unlocks the seal.\nInterior.\nInner Sanctum.\nThe interior is a large chamber with several &lt;a href=\"frozen%20Falmer\"&gt;frozen Falmer&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Frozen%20Chaurus\"&gt;chaurus&lt;/a&gt; inside. In the center of the main room is a &lt;a href=\"Shrine%20of%20Auriel\"&gt;Shrine of Auriel&lt;/a&gt;.\nOn the left wall, there is an altar where the initiate's ewer can be placed that grants access to a hidden room with a &lt;a href=\"frost%20giant\"&gt;frost giant&lt;/a&gt; inside. This giant holds the &lt;a href=\"ruby%20paragon\"&gt;ruby paragon&lt;/a&gt; that may be looted from its corpse if killed. There is also a second altar on the far right of the hidden room that, when activated with the Initiate's Ewer, reveals more hidden treasure.\nIf the &lt;a href=\"sapphire%20paragon\"&gt;sapphire paragon&lt;/a&gt; is used at the &lt;a href=\"paragon%20platform\"&gt;paragon platform&lt;/a&gt;, it will grant access to an otherwise inaccessible portion of the Inner Sanctum that contains some &lt;a href=\"Elven%20Arrow%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Elven arrows&lt;/a&gt; and other minor loot.\nThe rear of the sanctum connects to a glacial tunnel that leads to Auriel's Chapel.\nAuriel's Chapel.\nThe chapel is mostly in ruins and has been overwhelmed by the elements. The initial collapsed hallway opens up into a small cavern housing several frozen Falmer and &lt;a href=\"Arch-Curate%20Vyrthur\"&gt;Arch-Curate Vyrthur&lt;/a&gt; seated on a throne, behind which is a large balcony.\nInner Sanctum Balcony.\nThe grand balcony overlooks the Forgotten Vale. In the center is another Wayshrine of Auri-El that can be used to travel to other parts of the valley. Here is where the Dragonborn finally beats Arch-Curate Vyrthur, after a firefight of frozen falmer and charus, before he collapses the chapel and escapes to the said balcony."}
