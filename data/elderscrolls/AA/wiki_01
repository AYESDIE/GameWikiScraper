Their servants, the &lt;a href=\"Dragon%20Priests%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Dragon Priests&lt;/a&gt; established a ruling body known as the &lt;a href=\"Dragon%20Cult\"&gt;Dragon Cult&lt;/a&gt; and held power equals to kings.\nPart of the cult's beliefs was a faith focused on the worship of animal gods. The deified animals were the hawk, wolf, snake, moth, owl, whale, bear, fox, and the dragon. Low reliefs found in ancient Nordic ruins have led scholars to believe that these deified animals were actually totemic representations of several &lt;a href=\"Et%27Ada\"&gt;Et'Ada&lt;/a&gt;, some of which are present in the pantheon of the &lt;a href=\"Eight%20Divines\"&gt;Eight Divines&lt;/a&gt;. Of these reliefs; six are depicted as male and three as female.\nInfluence in Skyrim.\nThe Ancient Nordic Pantheon was brought to the shores of &lt;a href=\"Skyrim\"&gt;Skyrim&lt;/a&gt; during the mass Atmoran migration that took place over the next several centuries. It served as the predominant Nordic faith during the early First Era, however over the centuries the Nords eventually discarded the notion of animal worship and moved towards the worship of the &lt;a href=\"Et%27Ada\"&gt;Et'Ada&lt;/a&gt; themselves. This culminated in the formation of the &lt;a href=\"Nordic%20Pantheon\"&gt;Nordic Pantheon&lt;/a&gt; which served as the predominant religion in Skyrim until the rule of &lt;a href=\"Alessia\"&gt;Alessia&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"1E%20243\"&gt;1E 243&lt;/a&gt;, who melded &lt;a href=\"Aldmeri%20Pantheon\"&gt;Aldmeri&lt;/a&gt; and Nordic pantheons to create the pantheon of the &lt;a href=\"Eight%20Divines\"&gt;Eight Divines&lt;/a&gt;.\nAnimal gods.\nThe Dead Gods.\nFox.\nThe fox depicted as a male and is believed to be the representation of &lt;a href=\"Shor\"&gt;Shor&lt;/a&gt;, the fallen god-hero of mankind. Allusion to the characteristics of the fox include his successful attempt at persuading his fellow &lt;a href=\"Et%27ada\"&gt;Et'ada&lt;/a&gt; to create &lt;a href=\"Mundus\"&gt;Mundus&lt;/a&gt;.\nBear.\nThe bear depicted as a male and is believed to be the representation of &lt;a href=\"Tsun\"&gt;Tsun&lt;/a&gt;, Nordic god of trials against adversity. He served as shield-thane to &lt;a href=\"Shor\"&gt;Shor&lt;/a&gt; and died defending him from foreign gods during the &lt;a href=\"Ehlnofey\"&gt;Ehlnofey&lt;/a&gt; wars of the &lt;a href=\"Dawn%20Era\"&gt;Dawn Era&lt;/a&gt;.\nIn the Nordic afterlife of &lt;a href=\"Sovngarde%20%28Location%29\"&gt;Sovngarde&lt;/a&gt; he guards the Whalebone bridge.\nThe Hearth Gods.\nHawk.\nThe hawk depicted as a female and is believed to be the representation of &lt;a href=\"Kyne\"&gt;Kyne&lt;/a&gt;, warrior-widow of &lt;a href=\"Shor\"&gt;Shor&lt;/a&gt;, also known as the Goddess of the storm and the Mother of Men. Nords believe she was instrumental in both their creation and for giving them the gift of the &lt;a href=\"Thu%27um\"&gt;Thu'um&lt;/a&gt;.\nWolf.\nThe wolf depicted as a female and is believed to be the representation of &lt;a href=\"Mara\"&gt;Mara&lt;/a&gt;, the Goddess of love and handmaiden of Kyne.\nMoth.\nThe moth depicted as a female and is believed to be the representation of &lt;a href=\"Dibella\"&gt;Dibella&lt;/a&gt;, the Goddess of beauty.\nWhale.\nThe whale is depicted as a male and is believed to be the representation of &lt;a href=\"Stuhn\"&gt;Stuhn&lt;/a&gt;, the Nordic precursor to &lt;a href=\"Stendarr\"&gt;Stendarr&lt;/a&gt; and brother of &lt;a href=\"Tsun\"&gt;Tsun&lt;/a&gt;. Like his brother, he served as shield-thane to &lt;a href=\"Shor\"&gt;Shor&lt;/a&gt;, and fought against the &lt;a href=\"Aldmeri%20Pantheon\"&gt;Aldmeri Pantheon&lt;/a&gt; during the &lt;a href=\"War%20of%20Manifest%20Metaphors\"&gt;War of Manifest Metaphors&lt;/a&gt;.\nOwl.\nThe owl is depicted as a male and is believed to be the representation of &lt;a href=\"Jhunal\"&gt;Jhunal&lt;/a&gt;, the Nordic god of runes, hermetic orders, wisdom and knowledge. He is also known as the father of language and mathematics.\nThe Testing Gods.\nSnake.\nThe snake depicted as a male and is believed to be the representation of &lt;a href=\"Orkey\"&gt;Orkey&lt;/a&gt;, who tricked the Nords into giving up their long lifespans, and \"bound them to the count of winters.\"\nThe Twilight Gods.\nDragon.\nThe Dragon was the chief deity in the ancient Nordic pantheon as is widely accepted as being a representation of &lt;a href=\"Alduin\"&gt;Alduin&lt;/a&gt;, the god of time, as well as the \"World Eater.\" Low reliefs in ancient Nordic tombs don't depict them directly, rather their servants; the Dragon Priests are shown."}

She is a member of the &lt;a href=\"Mages%20Guild%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Mages Guild&lt;/a&gt; and wants to stop Canonreeve Oraneth. The canonreeve, an &lt;a href=\"Altmer%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Altmer&lt;/a&gt; politician, hired &lt;a href=\"Wood%20Orc\"&gt;Wood Orc&lt;/a&gt; mercenaries to dig up bones in &lt;a href=\"Elden%20Hollow\"&gt;Elden Hollow&lt;/a&gt;. From the unearthed bones, the Wood Orc made a ritual altar. Bakkhara asks them to disable, then she will pursue Oraneth. They can continue talking to her to learn more about the situation, if they want. Oraneth used to be a Guild Mage. She believes the Altmer are superior to all in &lt;a href=\"magic\"&gt;magic&lt;/a&gt;, and therefore better at other pursuits as well. Oraneth was very vocal about the Altmer leaving the Dominion, but after the Thalmor opposed her plan, she swore to save the Dominion herself. She picked up tomes on Conjuration and &lt;a href=\"Daedra\"&gt;Daedra&lt;/a&gt; from the Guild before she disappeared into the Hollow.\nIn the next room, defeat the Thalmor Justiciar and the &lt;a href=\"Darkfern%20Digger\"&gt;Darkfern Digger&lt;/a&gt;s. In front of the first altar is &lt;a href=\"Akash%20gra-Mal\"&gt;Akash gra-Mal&lt;/a&gt;. Once he is defeated, Bakkhara and her two mages, &lt;a href=\"Speaks-With-Lights\"&gt;Speaks-With-Lights&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Dracien\"&gt;Dracien&lt;/a&gt;, appear to disable the altar.\nContinue into the Hollow.

Defeat it, then continue to a larger room and defeat the &lt;a href=\"Darkfern%20Clan\"&gt;Darkferns&lt;/a&gt; there. After they have been defeated, Bakkhara will appear and disable the second altar. If they talk to her this time, she will say that Dracien thinks the altars are &lt;a href=\"necromantic\"&gt;necromantic&lt;/a&gt; and Oraneth might be a member of the &lt;a href=\"Worm%20Cult%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Worm Cult&lt;/a&gt;.\nIn the next large area, defeat &lt;a href=\"Nenesh%20gro-Mal\"&gt;Nenesh gro-Mal&lt;/a&gt; and the Darkferns. Further along, they come across a giant &lt;a href=\"Alit%20%28Online%29\"&gt;alit&lt;/a&gt; named &lt;a href=\"Leafseether\"&gt;Leafseether&lt;/a&gt;. In the final room, the canonreeve is standing in front of another dark altar. This one appears to have some kind of portal active in it.\nOnce they have defeated the canonreeve, the three mages try to disable the altar. However, it does not work, and they are thrown back. Talk to Bakkhara.\n\"Oraneth is dead, the ritual broken, yet evil still stirs here. There is a darkness growing from the earth below, sprouting from a seed of death. We have failed. The darkness is coming, with no one to control it\u2026\"\nWhen they try to ask her what they should do, the conversation ends, and she orders everyone out, claiming Oraneth will be the undoing of their group, as she runs into the darkness. She tells Speaks-With-Lights to warn the guild and &lt;a href=\"Tamriel\"&gt;Tamriel&lt;/a&gt;.\nUse the portal to escape, then talk to Speaks-With-Lights.

The bouquet of roses in her hand fell to the ground. For a moment it was as if all birds had ceased to sing and a cloud had passed over the sky. Her carefully cultivated haven seemed to flood over with darkness.\n\"We have thy son,\" it read. \"We will be in touch with thee shortly with our ransom demands.\"\nZarek had never made it as far as Akgun after all. One of the brigands on the road, &lt;a href=\"Orsimer%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Orcs&lt;/a&gt; probably, or accursed &lt;a href=\"Dunmer%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Dunmer&lt;/a&gt;, must have seen his well-appointed carriage and taken him hostage. Jalemmil clutched at a post for support, wondering if her boy had been hurt. He was but a student, not the sort to fight against well-armed men, but had they beaten him? It was more than a mother's heart could bear.\n\"Don't tell me they sent the ransom note so quickly,\" called a familiar voice, and a familiar face appeared through the hedge. It was Zarek. Jalemmil hurried to embrace her boy, tears running down her face.\n\"What happened?\" she cried. \"I thought thou hadst been kidnapped.\"\n\"I was,\" said Zarek. \"Three huge soaring &lt;a href=\"Nords%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Nords&lt;/a&gt; attacked my carriage on the Frimvorn Pass. Brothers, as I learned, named Mathais, Ulin, and Koorg. Thou shouldst have seen these men, mother. Each one of them would have had trouble fitting through the front door, I can tell thee.\"\n\"What happened?\" Jalemmil repeated. \"Wert thou rescued?\"\n\"I thought about waiting for that, but I knew they'd send off a ransom note and I know how thou does worry. So I remembered what my mentor at Akgun always said about remaining calm, observing thy surroundings, and looking for thy opponent's weakness,\" Zarek grinned. \"It took a while, though, because these fellows were truly monsters. And then, when I listened to them bragging to one another, I realized that vanity was their weakness.\"\n\"What didst thou do?\"\n\"They had me chained at their camp in the woods not far from Cael on a high knoll overlooking a wide river. I heard one of them, Koorg, telling the others that it would take the better part of an hour to swim across the river and back. They were nodding in agreement when I spoke up.\n\"'I could swim that river and back in thirty minutes,' I said.\n\"'Impossible,' said Koorg. 'I can swim faster than a little whelp like thee.'\n\"So it was agreed that we would dive off the cliff, swim to the center island, and return. As we went to our respective rocks, Koorg took it upon himself to lecture me about all the fine points of swimming: the importance of synchronized movements of the arms and legs for maximum speed, and how essential it was to breathe after only the third or fourth stroke, not too often to slow thyself down, but not too little to lose one's air. I nodded and agreed to all his fine points. Then we dove off the cliffs. I made it to the island and back in a little over an hour, but Koorg never returned. He had dashed his brains at the rocks at the base of the cliff. I had noticed the telltale signs of underwater rocks and had taken the diving rock on the right.\"\n\"But thou returned?\" asked Jalemmil, astounded. \"Was that not when thou escaped?\"\n\"It was too risky to escape then,\" said Zarek. \"They could have easily caught me again, and I wasn't keen to be blamed for Koorg's disappearance. I said I did not know what happened to him, and after some searching, they decided he had forgotten about the race and had swum ashore to hunt for food. They could not see how I could have had anything to do with his disappearance, as fully visible as I was throughout my swim. The two brothers began making camp along the rocky cliff-edge, picking an ideal location so that I would not be able to escape.\n\"One of the brothers, Mathais, began commenting on the quality of the soil and the gradual incline of the rock that circled around the bay below. It was ideal, he said, for a foot race. I expressed my ignorance of the sport, and he was keen to give me details of the proper technique for running a race. He made absurd faces, showing how one must breathe in through the nose and out through the mouth; how to bend one's knees to the proper angle on the rise, and the importance of sure foot placement. Most important, he explained, was that one must keep an aggressive but not too strenuous pace if one intends to win. It is fine to run in second place through the race, he said, provided one has the willpower and strength to pull out in the end.\n\"I was an enthusiastic student, and Mathais decided that we ought to run a quick race around the edge of the bay before night fell. Ulin told us to bring some firewood when we came back. We began at once down the path, skirting the cliff below. I followed his advice about breath, gait, and foot placement, but I ran with all my power right from the start. Despite his much longer legs, I was a few paces ahead as we rounded the first corner.\n\"With his eyes on my back, Mathais did not see the gap in the rock that I jumped over. He plummeted over the cliff before he had a chance to cry out. I spent a few minutes gathering some twigs before I returned to Ulin at camp.\""}

Ulin would have noticed my absence and caught up with me in no time, and I would have had a hard time explaining Mathais's absence. However, the brief forage around the area allowed me to observe some of the trees close up, and I could formulate my final plan.\n\"When I got back to camp with a few twigs, I told Ulin that Mathais was slow coming along, dragging a large dead tree behind him. Ulin scoffed at his brother's strength, saying it would take him time to pull up a live tree by the roots and drop it on the bonfire. I expressed reasonable doubt.\n\"'I'll show thee,' he said, ripping up a ten-foot-tall specimen effortlessly.\n\"'But that's scarcely a sapling,' I objected. 'I thought thou couldst rip up a tree.' His eyes followed mine to a magnificent, heavy-looking one at the edge of the clearing. Ulin grabbed it and began to shake it with a tremendous force to loosen its roots from the dirt. With that, he loosened the hive from the uppermost branches, dropping it down onto his head.\n\"That was when I made my escape, mother,\" said Zarek in conclusion, showing a little schoolboy pride. \"While Mathais and Koorg were at the base of the cliff, and Ulin was flailing about, engulfed by a swarm.\"\nJalemmil embraced her son once again.\nPublisher's Note:\nI was reluctant to publish Marobar Sul's \"Ancient Scrolls of the Dwemer,\" but when the University of Gwylim Press asked me to edit this edition, I decided to use this as an opportunity to set the record straight once and for all.\nScholars do not agree on the exact date of Marobar Sul's work, but it is generally agreed that they were written by the playwright \"Gor Felim,\" famous for popular comedies and romances during the &lt;a href=\"Second%20Era\"&gt;Second Era&lt;/a&gt; after the fall of the &lt;a href=\"Reman%20Empire\"&gt;Reman Empire&lt;/a&gt;. The current theory holds that Felim heard a few genuine Dwemer tales and adapted them to the stage in order to make money, along with rewritten versions of many of his own plays.\nGor Felim created the persona of \"Marobar Sul\" who could translate the Dwemer language in order to add some sort of validity to the work and make it even more valuable to the gullible. Note that while \"Marobar Sul\" and his works became the subject of heated controversy, there are no reliable records of anyone actually meeting \"Marobar Sul,\" nor was there anyone of that name employed by the &lt;a href=\"Mages%20Guild%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Mages Guild&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"School%20of%20Julianos\"&gt;School of Julianos&lt;/a&gt;, or any other intellectual institution.\nIn any case, the Dwemer in most of the tales of \"Marobar Sul\" bear little resemblance to the fearsome, unfathomable race that frightened even the &lt;a href=\"Dunmer%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Dunmer&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Nords%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Nords&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Redguards%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Redguards&lt;/a&gt; into submission and built ruins that even now have yet to be understood."}

No vegetation of any kind grew in Lorikh, though there were blackened vestiges of long-dead trees scattered throughout the town. Arriving by caravan, Kamdida looked at her new home with despair. She was used to the forestland of the north, where her father's family had hailed from. Here there was no shade, little water, and a great open sky. The land looked dead.\nHer mother's family took Kamdida and her younger brother Nevith in, and they were very kind to the orphans, but she felt lonely in the alien village. It was not until she met an old &lt;a href=\"Argonians%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Argonian&lt;/a&gt; woman who worked at the water factory that Kamdida found a friend. Her name was Sigerthe, and she said that her family had lived in Lorikh centuries before the Dwemer arrived, when it was a great and beauteous forest.\n\"Why did the trees die?\" asked Kamdida.\n\"When there were Argonians only in this land, we never cut trees, for we had no need for fuel or wooden structures such as you possess. When the Dwemer came, we allowed them to use the plants as they needed them, provided they never touched the &lt;a href=\"Hist\"&gt;Hist&lt;/a&gt;, which were sacred to us and to the land. For many years, we lived peaceably. No one wanted for anything.\"\n\"What happened?\"\n\"Some of your scientists discovered that by distilling a certain tree sap, molding it, and drying it, they could create a resilient kind of armor called &lt;a href=\"Resin%20%28Online%29\"&gt;resin&lt;/a&gt;,\" said Sigerthe. \"Most of the trees that grew here had very thin ichor in their branches, but not the Hist. Many of them fairly glistened with sap, which made the Dwemer merchants greedy. They hired a woodsman named Juhnin to start clearing the sacred arbors for profit.\"\nThe old Argonian woman looked to the dusty ground and sighed, \"Of course, the Argonians cried out against it. It was our home, and the Hist, once gone, would never return. The merchants reconsidered, but Juhnin took it on his own to break our spirit. He proved one terrible, bloody day that his prodigious skill with the axe could be used against people as well as trees. Any Argonian who stood in his way was hewn asunder. The Dwemer people of Lorikh closed their doors and their ears to the cries of murder.\"\n\"Horrible,\" gasped Kamdida.\n\"It is difficult to explain,\" said Sigerthe, \"but the deaths of our living ones was not nearly as horrible to us as the death of our trees. You must understand that to my people, the Hist are where we come from and where we are going. Destroying our bodies is nothing. Destroying our trees annihilates us utterly. When Juhnin turned his axe on the Hist, he killed the land. The water disappeared, the animals died, and all the other life that the trees nourished crumbled and dried to dust.\"\n\"Then why are you still here?\" asked Kamdida. \"Why didn't you leave?\"\n\"We are trapped. I am one of the last of a dying people. Few of us are strong enough to live away from our ancestral groves, and sometimes, even now, there is a perfume in the air of Lorikh that gives us life. It will not be long until we are all gone.\"\nKamdida felt tears welling up in her eyes. \"Then I will be alone in this horrible place with no trees and no friends.\"\n\"We Argonians have an expression,\" said Sigerthe with a sad smile, taking Kamdida\u2019s hand. \"The best soil for a seed is found in your heart.\"\nKamdida looked into the palm of her hand and saw that Sigerthe had given her a small black pellet. It was a seed. \"It looks dead.\"\n\"It can only grow in one place in all Lorikh,\" said the old Argonian. \"Outside an old cottage in the hills outside town. I cannot go there, for the owner would kill me on sight. Like all my people, I am too frail to defend myself now, but you can go there and plant the seed.\"\n\"What will happen?\" asked Kamdida. \"Will the Hist return?\"\n\"No, but some part of their power will.\"\nThat night, Kamdida stole from her house and into the hills. She knew the cottage Sigerthe had mentioned. As she approached it, the door opened and an old but powerfully built man appeared with a mighty axe slung over his shoulder.\n\"What are you doing here, child?\" he demanded. \"In the dark, I almost took you to be a lizard-man.\"\n\"I've lost my way in the dark. I'm trying to get back to Lorikh.\"\n\"Be on your way then.\"\n\"Do you have a candle I might have?\" she asked piteously. \"I've been walking in circles, and I\u2019m afraid I'll only return back here without light.\"\nThe old man grumbled and walked into his house. Quickly, Kamdida dug a hole in the dry dirt and buried the seed as deeply as she could. He returned with a lit candle.\n\"See to it you don't come back here,\" he growled, \"or I'll chop you in half.\"\nHe returned to his house. The next morning, when he awoke and opened the door, he found that his cottage was entirely sealed within an enormous tree. He picked up his axe and delivered blow and after blow to the wood, but he could never break through. He tried side chops, but the wood healed itself. He tried an upper chop, but the wood sealed.\nMuch time went by before someone discovered old Juhnin's emaciated body lying in front of his open door, still holding his blunted, broken axe. What he'd been chopping with it was a mystery, but the rumor spread that Hist sap was found on the blade.\nShortly thereafter, small flowers began pushing up through the town's dry dirt. The Hist did not return, but at twilight the shadows of great trees would fill the streets."}

There he met two monsters. One, bloodied with the flesh of the chieftain of Othrobar's flock, fought him while its mate fled. Fangbith remembered what his master had taught him, that \"where\" was all that was important.\nHe struck the monster on each of its five vital points: head, groin, throat, back, and chest. With five blows to the five points, the monster was slain. It was too heavy to carry with him, but still triumphant, Fangbith returned to Othrobar.\n\"I say I have slain the monster that ate your flock,\" he cried.\n\"What proof have you that you have slain a monster?\" asked the chieftain.\n\"I say I have saved the flock with my medicine,\" said Ghorick the Healer.\n\"I say the Goddess has saved the flock by my sacrifices,\" said Beran the Priest.\nTwo mornings went by and the flocks were safe, but on the morning of the third day, another tenfold of the chieftain's flock was found butchered. Ghorick the Healer went to his study to find a new medicine. Beran the Priest prepared more sacrifices. Fangbith took his Zolic cudgel in hand again, and he walked far through the dark forest until he came to the base of the Great Mountain. There he met the other monster, bloodied with the flesh of the chieftain of Othrobar's flock. They did battle, and again Fangbith remembered what his master had taught him, that \"where\" was all that was important.\nHe struck the monster five times on the head and it fled. Chasing it along the mountain, he struck it five times in the groin and it fled. Running through the forest, Fangbith overtook the monster and struck it five times in the throat and it fled. Entering into the fields of Othrobar, Fangbith overtook the monster and struck it five times in the back and it fled. At the foot of the stronghold, the chieftain and his wise men emerged to the sound of the monster wailing. There they beheld the monster that had slain the chieftain's flock. Fangbith struck the monster five times in the chest and it was slain.\nA great feast was held in Fangbith's honor, and the flock of Othrobar was never again slain. Joltereg embraced his student and said, \"You have at last learned the importance of where you strike your blows.\""}

The little milk-drinker's going to play pick-up-sticks, but he can handle only one stick!\"\n\"At least I don't swear by a god who is not only imaginary, but dead,\" said the Dwemer, as the barkeep placed his items on the counter.\n\"Hey! What?\" the Nord blustered. \"Why, I ought to\u2026!\"\n\"He's got you there, by &lt;a href=\"Azura%27s%20Star\"&gt;Azura's Star&lt;/a&gt;,\" said the Chimer, sipping at his shein. \"A point for you, Dwarf.\"\n\"On the other hand, at least the Nord doesn't think it's clever to worship &lt;a href=\"Daedric%20Princes\"&gt;demons&lt;/a&gt; from &lt;a href=\"Oblivion%20%28Realm%29\"&gt;other planes&lt;/a&gt;,\" said the Dwemer, swirling his chal.\n\"&lt;a href=\"Boethiah\"&gt;Boethiah&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Mephala\"&gt;Mephala&lt;/a&gt;!

It landed on the floor just where the Chimer was putting down his foot for his thrust. He slipped, lurched left, and buried his dagger to the hilt in the surprised Nord's chest. Meanwhile the Dwemer gave the big needle a precise flick of the finger; it spun down and lodged in a crack between the floor-planks, point up. As the Chimer back-pedaled from the dying Nord, he lost his balance and fell headfirst to the floor, where the needle pierced one of his golden eyes all the way into his brain. It took several minutes of flailing, but eventually the Chimer was as dead as the Nord.\nThe Dwemer pulled a coin-purse from the Chimer's belt and gave it to the barkeep, swallowed the Nord's mead in one prolonged chug, picked up the snifter of shein and took a sip, then nodded to the barkeep and left the cornerclub, snifter in hand. \"Off to the market,\" they heard him say. \"I must get a bone-tweezer, a &lt;a href=\"Guar%20Eggs\"&gt;guar egg&lt;/a&gt;, and a boot-jack.\""}

The Chimer had great skills in magic and swordplay, but against the armored battalions of the Dwemer clad in the finest shielding wrought by Jnaggo, there was little hope of their ever winning. In the interests of keeping some measure of peace in the Land, Sthovin the Warlord agreed to a truce with Karenithil Barif the Beast. In exchange for the Disputed Lands, Sthovin gave Barif a mighty golem that would protect the Chimer's territory from the excursions of the Northern Barbarians.\nBarif was delighted with his gift and brought it back to his camp, where all his warriors gaped in awe at it. Sparkling gold in hue, it resembled a Dwemer cavalier with a proud aspect. To test its strength, they placed the golem in the center of an arena and flung magical bolts of lightning at it. Its agility was such that few of the bolts struck it. It had the wherewithal to pivot on its hips to avoid the brunt of the attacks without losing its balance, feet firmly planted on the ground. A volley of fireballs followed, which the golem ably dodged, bending its knees and its legs to spin around the blasts. The few times it was struck, it made certain to be hit in the chest and waist, the strongest parts of its body.\nThe troops cheered at the sight of such an agile and powerful creation. With it leading the defense, the Barbarians of Skyrim would never again successfully raid their villages. They named it Chimarvamidium, the Hope of the Chimer.\nBarif had the golem brought to his chambers with all his housethanes. There they tested Chimarvamidium further, its strength, its speed, its resiliency. They could find no flaw with its design.\n\"Imagine when the naked barbarians first meet this on one of their raids,\" laughed one of the housethanes.\n\"It is only unfortunate that it resembles a Dwemer instead of one of our own,\" mused Karenithil Barif. \"It is revolting to think that they will have a greater respect for our other enemies than us.\"\n\"I think we should never accepted the peace terms that we did,\" said another, one of the most aggressive of the housethanes. \"Is it too late to surprise the warlord Sthovin with an attack?\"\n\"It is never too late to attack,\" said Barif, \"but what of his great armored warriors?\u201d\n\"I understand,\" said Barif's spymaster, \"that his soldiers always wake at dawn. If we strike an hour before, we can catch them defenseless before they've had a chance to bathe, let alone don their armor.\"\n\"If we capture their armorer Jnaggo, then we too would know the secrets of blacksmith,\" said Barif. \"Let it be done. We will attack tomorrow, an hour before dawn.\"\nSo it was settled. The Chimer army marched at night and swarmed into the Dwemer camp. They were relying on Chimarvamidium to lead the first wave, but it malfunctioned and began attacking the Chimer's own troops. Added to that, the Dwemer were fully armored, well-rested, and eager for battle. The surprise was turned, and most of the high-ranking Chimer, including Karenithil Barif the Beast, were captured.\nThough they were too proud to ask, Sthovin explained to them that he had been warned of their attack by a Calling from one of his men.\n\"What man of yours is in our camp?\" sneered Barif.\nChimarvamidium, standing erect by the side of the captured, removed its head. Within its metal body was Jnaggo, the armorer.\n\"A Dwemer child of eight can create a golem,\" he explained, \"but only a truly great warrior and armorer can pretend to be one.\""}

The geode's vibratory affinities continued to elude him, however, so one day he threw down his attenuators, left his workshop and went to the kitchens for an infusion of chal.\nAs he approached the kitchen portal he heard sibilant music that cut off abruptly as he stepped over the threshold. His house-assistant, a &lt;a href=\"Snow%20Elf\"&gt;Snow Elf&lt;/a&gt; maiden named Lilyarel, withdrew her hands from behind the steam-grill and looked up guiltily.\n\"I heard music, Lilyarel,\" Mzulchond said. \"What did you just put behind the calorefactor?\"\n\"It's nothing, Sir Dwarf,\" the maiden replied. \"Just something I cobbled together to pass the time.\"\n\"What? Have you been in my device-closet again? Show me what you have there.\"\nReluctantly, the Snow Elf reached behind the steam-grill and drew out a fist-sized object of golden metal, crystal knobs glinting on its flange-hood. Mzulchond held out his hand, open, and Lilyarel carefully placed the object in it. \"Don't drop it,\" she said. \"It'll get de-tuned.\"\n\"Well, well,\" the engineer said. \"So you've built yourself a crude tonal variation-lens. Is this what was playing the music I heard?\"\n\"Yes, Sir Dwarf,\" the maiden said, gazing at the floor. \"I hope I didn't do anything wrong.\"\n\"What, with this device? There's nothing dangerous in a melodic repeater bauble, so long as it doesn't leak bthun-waves from its volumizer. Can't have that\u2014might interfere with the static condensers.\"\n\"Oh, don't worry, I used arkoid shielding\u2014not very much!\" she said anxiously. \"But it's not a melodic repeater, Sir, it harmonizes with my mental melodies.\"\n\"Nonsense,\" Mzulchond scoffed. \"No one knows how to synchronize a variation-lens with mental concept-cycles. It's never been done.\"\n\"I wouldn't know anything about that, Sir Dwarf,\" Lilyarel said, wringing her hands nervously. \"I just flipped the duum-emitter so it canceled the demi-ektar-waves, and it worked just fine. Can I have it back now?\"\n\"Hold on a dzum,\" the engineer said, raising a hand while he looked more closely at the gleaming device. \"Flipping the duum-emitter cancels the demi-ektars? Yes \u2026 yes, I can see how that might work. This may be just the thing I need to attune my animus geode to the Nirnpith Essence!\"\nAs Mzulchond turned in excitement to take the variation-lens back to his workshop, the Elf maiden picked up a flipper-strut with both hands and struck him across the back of the head. The tonal architect fell dead to the ground, as Lilyarel picked up her shiny device. \"Never liked him,\" she hissed to herself. \"Always smelled like Dwemer oil.\"\nThen she opened the brazen louvers of a vent-tube, crawled in, and began lowering herself down through the inwards of the Dwarven city. \"Guess I'm going down to join the undermer, and not coming back.\" And with that, she turned on her variation-lens, which immediately began harmonizing with her mental melodies."}

When she reached the age of consent, he locked the gold away for safe-keeping and announced his intention to have her marry. She was a comely lass, a scholar, a great athlete, but dour and brooding in aspect. This personality defect did not bother her potential suitors any more than her positive traits impressed them. Every man knew the tremendous wealth that would be his as the husband of Genefra and son-in-law of Ynaleigh. That alone was enough for hundreds to come to Gunal to pay court.\n\"The man who will marry my daughter,\" said Ynaleigh to the assembled, \"must not be doing so purely out of avarice. He must demonstrate his own wealth to my satisfaction.\"\nThis simple pronouncement removed a vast majority of the suitors, since they knew they could not impress the landowner with their meager fortunes. A few dozen did come forward within a few days, clad in fine killarc cloth of spun silver, accompanied by exotic servants, traveling in magnificent carriages. All who came who met with Ynaleigh's approval, but none arrived in a more resplendent fashion than Welyn Naerillic. The young man, whom no one had ever heard of, arrived in a shining ebon coach drawn by a team of &lt;a href=\"Dragons%20%28Lore%29\"&gt;dragons&lt;/a&gt;, his clothing of rarest manufacture. He was accompanied by an army of the most fantastical servants any of Gunal had ever seen. His valets had eyes on all sides of their heads, and his maidservants seemed cast in gemstones.\nSuch was not enough for Ynaleigh.\n\"The man who marries my daughter must prove himself an intelligent fellow, for I would not have an ignoramus as a son-in-law and business partner,\" he declared.\nThis eliminated a large part of the wealthy suitors. Through their lives of luxury, they had never needed to think very much, if at all. Still, some came forward over the next few days, demonstrating their wit and learning, quoting the great sages of the past and offering their philosophies of metaphysics and alchemy. Welyn Naerillic also came and asked Ynaleigh to dine at the villa he had rented outside of Gunal. There, the landowner saw scores of scribes working on translations of Aldmeri tracts and enjoyed the young man's somewhat irreverent but intriguing intelligence.\nNevertheless, though he was much impressed with Welyn Naerillic, Ynaleigh had another challenge.\n\"I love my daughter very much,\" said Ynaleigh, \"and I hope that the man who marries her will make her happy as well. Should any of you make her smile, she and the great dowry are yours.\"\nThe suitors lined up for days, singing her songs, proclaiming their devotion, describing her beauty in the most poetic of terms. Genefra merely glared at all with hatred and melancholia. Ynaleigh stood by her side and began to despair. His daughter's suitors were failing to a man. Finally Welyn Naerillic came to the chamber.\n\"I will make your daughter smile,\" he said. \"I dare say, I'll make her laugh, but only after you've agreed to marry us. If she is not delighted within one hour of our engagement, the wedding can be called off.\"\nYnaleigh turned to his daughter. She was not smiling, but her eyes had sparked with some morbid curiosity in this young man. As no other suitor had even registered that for her, he agreed.\n\"The dowry is naturally not to be paid 'til after you've wed,\" said Ynaleigh. \"Being engaged is not enough.\"\n\"Might I see the dowry still?\" asked Welyn.\nKnowing how fabled the treasure was and understanding that this would likely be the closest the young man would come to possessing it, Ynaleigh agreed. He had grown quite found of Welyn. On his orders, Welyn, Ynaleigh, glum Genefra, and the castellan delved deeply into the stronghold of Gunal. The first vault had to be opened by touching a series of runic symbols. Should one of the marks be activated incorrectly, a volley of poisoned arrows would have struck the thief. Ynaleigh was particularly proud of the next level of security: a lock composed of blades with eighteen tumblers that required three keys to be turned simultaneously. The blades were designed to eviscerate any who merely picked one of the locks. Finally, they reached the storeroom.\nIt was entirely empty.\n\"By Lorkhan, we've been burgled!\" cried Ynaleigh. \"But how? Who could have done this?\"\n\"A humble but, if I may say so, rather talented burglar,\" said Welyn. \"A man who has loved your daughter from afar for many years, but did not possess the glamor or the learning to impress. That is, until the gold from her dowry afforded me the opportunity.\"\n\"You?\" bellowed Ynaleigh, scarcely able to believe it. Then something even more unbelievable happened.\nGenefra began to laugh. She had never even dreamed of meeting anyone like this thief. She threw herself into his arms before her father's outraged eyes. After a moment, Ynaleigh began to laugh as well.\nGenefra and Welyn were married in a month's time. Though he was in fact quite poor and had little scholarship, Ynaleigh was amazed how much his wealth increased with such a son-in-law and business partner.\nHe made certain never to ask from whence the excess gold came."}

He invented much and created many theorems and logic structures that bore his name. But much of the world still puzzled him, and nothing was a greater enigma to him than the nature of the &lt;a href=\"Aedra\"&gt;Aedra&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Daedra\"&gt;Daedra&lt;/a&gt;. Over the course of his research, he came to the conclusion that many of the Gods were entirely fabricated by man and mer.\nNothing, however, was a greater question to Nchylbar than the limits of divine power. Were the Greater Beings the masters of the entire world, or did the humbler creatures have the strength to forge their own destinies? As Nchylbar found himself nearing the end of his life, he felt he must understand this last basic truth.\nAmong the sage's acquaintances was a holy &lt;a href=\"Chimer\"&gt;Chimer&lt;/a&gt; priest named Athynic. When the priest was visiting Bthalag-Zturamz, Nchylbar told him what he intended to do to find the nature of divine power. Athynic was terrified and pleaded with his friend not to break this great mystery, but Nchylbar was resolute. Finally, the priest agreed to assist out of love for his friend, though he feared the results of this blasphemy.\nAthynic summoned &lt;a href=\"Azura\"&gt;Azura&lt;/a&gt;. After the usual rituals by which the priest declared his faith in her powers and Azura agreed to do no harm to him, Nchylbar and a dozen of his students entered the summoning chamber, carrying with them a large box.\n\"As we see you in our land, Azura, you are the Goddess of the Dusk and Dawn and all the mysteries therein,\" said Nchylbar, trying to appear as kindly and obsequious as he could be. \"It is said that your knowledge is absolute.\"\n\"So it is,\" smiled the Daedra.\n\"You would know, for example, what is in this wooden box,\" said Nchylbar.\nAzura turned to Athynic, her brow furrowed. The priest was quick to explain, \"Goddess, this Dwemer is a very wise and respected man. Believe me, please, the intention is not to mock your greatness, but to demonstrate it to this scientist and to the rest of his skeptical race. I have tried to explain your power to him, but his philosophy is such that he must see it demonstrated.\"\n\"If I am to demonstrate my might in a way to bring the Dwemer race to understanding, it might have been a more impressive feat you would have me do,\" growled Azura, and turned to look Nchylbar in the eyes. \"There is a red-petalled flower in the box.\"\nNchylbar did not smile or frown. He simply opened the box and revealed to all that it was empty.\nWhen the students turned to look to Azura, she was gone. Only Athynic had seen the Goddess's expression before she vanished, and he could not speak, he was trembling so. A curse had fallen, he knew that truly, but even crueler was the knowledge of divine power that had been demonstrated. Nchylbar also looked pale, uncertain on his feet, but his face shone with not fear, but bliss. The smile of a Dwemer finding evidence for a truth only suspected.\nTwo of his students supported him, and two more supported the priest as they left the chamber.\n\"I have studied very much over the years, performed countless experiments, taught myself a thousand languages, and yet the skill that has taught me the finally truth is the one that I learned when I was but a poor, young man, trying only to have enough gold to eat,\" whispered the sage.\nAs he was escorted up the stairs to his bed, a red flower petal fell from the sleeve of his voluminous robe. Nchylbar died that night, a portrait of peace that comes from contented knowledge."}

I expect that there will be difficult days ahead, but if I succeed, my place among the great mages of history will be assured.\n23rd Rains Hand: Still not able to even reproduce Empedocles's results with maggots. I'm beginning to think his reputation is overblown.\n3rd &lt;a href=\"Second%20Seed\"&gt;Second Seed&lt;/a&gt;, Tirdas: Empedocles was right! The mistranslation of \"sunlit\" to \"scorching heat\" explains my earlier problems. From now on I will work only in the original &lt;a href=\"Daedric%20Alphabet\"&gt;daedric&lt;/a&gt;, despite the risks.\nFredas (mid Second Seed?): Local peasants came by to complain about the noise. I promised them that all that was behind me. A pleasant if dull-witted crew.\nMorndas (I think): The experiment today went better than expected. Although the number of rats produced was surprising, they were all remarkably docile, just as Malham predicted (although only I have ever proven it empirically!).\nMiddas: Villagers again. More complaints. You would think they'd never seen a rat before! They are starting to become a real nuisance.\nI've run into a terrible snag. &lt;a href=\"Galerion%27s%20Ninth%20Law\"&gt;Galerion's Ninth Law&lt;/a&gt; appears immutable! If the total life generated cannot exceed the cube of the source, this line of research may prove a dead end. I must reread Empedocles for any hint that he was able to circumvent this barrier.\nNext day: The locals are becoming insufferable! While I was walking in the woods, some of them broke into my laboratory and spilled the solution I was preparing -- nearly a full quart of purified imp gall wasted! They did not seem to grasp the absurdity of a crowd of unwashed peasants with dung on their boots complaining about the smell. It is well past time I did something about this problem.\nTwo days later: I dug up the notes from my permanent invisibility thesis. No time like the present to put theory into practice!\nToday: The spell worked! Not perfect invisibility, of course (&lt;a href=\"Vanto%27s%20Third%20Law\"&gt;Vanto's Third Law&lt;/a&gt;), but it was more powerful than I expected. And there were none of the side effects that &lt;a href=\"Hannibal%20Traven%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;Professor Traven&lt;/a&gt; had predicted. Ha ha, even in my youth I was already outstripping my elders. Now I can get back to my real work in peace."}

He eventually decided to cease working for the &lt;a href=\"Daedric%20Prince\"&gt;Daedric Prince&lt;/a&gt;, which prompted Peryite to seek the &lt;a href=\"Last%20Dragonborn\"&gt;Dragonborn&lt;/a&gt; and solicit them in ridding &lt;a href=\"Nirn\"&gt;Nirn&lt;/a&gt; of the unfaithful priest.\nCombat.\nIn combat, Orchendor is unique in that unlike other mages, he will teleport to a nearby place or to a different floor of the same room after taking a few hits. He becomes temporarily invulnerable at the time of performing the teleportation. Due to his ability to teleport, Orchendor has 100% magic resistance, making him immune to &lt;a href=\"Fire%20Damage%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;fire&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Frost%20Damage%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;frost damage&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Shock%20Damage%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;shock&lt;/a&gt; spells, as well as absorption effects. He is also immune to paralysis effects, such as &lt;a href=\"Ice%20Form\"&gt;Ice Form&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Paralyze%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Paralyze&lt;/a&gt;, as well as all shouts except &lt;a href=\"Drain%20Vitality%20%28Dawnguard%29\"&gt;Drain Vitality&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Soul%20Tear%20%28Dawnguard%29\"&gt;Soul Tear&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Bend%20Will\"&gt;Bend Will&lt;/a&gt;. As such, it is best to completely forgo directly offensive spells. \nOrchendor's arsenal includes standard &lt;a href=\"Destruction%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Destruction&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Spells%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;spells&lt;/a&gt;, particularly favoring frost. If the Dragonborn tries to fight him at a low level, it may be very difficult to beat him due to him being a unique and powerful destruction mage. Orchendor can be best defeated by:\nOrchendor's unique ability to teleport can be prevented by making him leave his living quarters and luring him to the area with dwarven spiders. When he attempts to teleport, he will still benefit from temporary invulnerability but will have remained in the same location. Also, when Orchendor teleports, he will no longer be aware of the Dragonborn's location, allowing them to capitalize on sneak attacks."}

Forty years ago, my grandfather fought in a raid on &lt;a href=\"Orsinium%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Orsinium&lt;/a&gt;. Those Orcs are relentless, he said. When an Orc's bleeding, and you've broken one of his bones, and he's getting back on his feet after you've knocked him down in the mud, that's the worst, because that's when he's even more dangerous.\nThat's why we worked with the &lt;a href=\"Redguards%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Redguard&lt;/a&gt;s to raze Orsinium to the ground. That's why we burned down every Orc stronghold we could find and stamped on the ashes\u2014because we knew the Orcs would get back up again. We knew the best we could do was just delay them.\nNowadays Orsinium is stronger than ever\u2014but we all know that we've got worse problems than Orcs.\nI would expect the Orcs to hold a grudge about us keeping them down, but that's one of the strange things about dealing with an Orc. I've actually seen one punch another in the face. The guy who got a broken nose just stood there and grinned. They might fight, or one of them might die, but Orcs make sure that whatever's going on, it's going to get settled real quick. And then it's over.\nWhen we burned down Orsinium, it was a bit more than a punch in the face, but the Orcs made sure a treaty settled all that real quick.\nI've never met an Orc who wasn't good in a fight, but I get the feeling some of them really want more to their lives than fighting. I guess when you live or die by the swords and armor you've made, you learn to make them right the first time. I'm still stunned by how good their craftsmanship is. Everything's built to last.\nI think both of us\u2014the &lt;a href=\"Bretons%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Breton&lt;/a&gt;s and the Orcs\u2014realized we could make a lot more money trading with each other than fighting with each other. And if there's one thing Bretons know how to do, it's make money. Well, it's not the only thing we do, but you get the idea.\nI know where I stand with an Orc. I also know where I stand with the &lt;a href=\"Nords%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Nord&lt;/a&gt;s: and if they think they can still send raiding parties into &lt;a href=\"High%20Rock%20%28Online%29\"&gt;High Rock&lt;/a&gt;, well, now we've got an army of Orcs on our side ready to kick their arses all the way back to &lt;a href=\"Skyrim%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Skyrim&lt;/a&gt;.\nAnd that's why I always say: I'm sure glad those Orcs are on our side."}

I swear, if they aren't constantly polishing or sharpening the damn things, they're studying them in whatever reflective surface is at hand or looking longingly at the tusks of their neighbors. And when they're not doing these things, they're talking about their tusks like they were royal heirlooms or ancient relics that were almost magical in nature. Let me tell you, it's enough to drive this &lt;a href=\"Dunmer%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Dark Elf&lt;/a&gt; a bit mad!\nWhile I supposed it would be rude to just come right out and ask an Orc about this obsession with all things tusk related, I decided that making a study of how the word and concept of the tusk was used in every Orc speech cound help me reach some level of understanding. The first Orc I approached about the subject, a young female who I'll call \"Orcah,\" made an angry face - at least, I think it was angry, I find it difficult to tell the difference when it comes to the countenance of average Orc - and told me in an angry voice to \"tusk off!\nWhat an odd expression, I thought. \"Tusk off.\" Simple, declarative. It means almost nothing, but as it emerged from Orcah's mouth, I knew exactly what she wanted me to do. I departed quickly, making my apologies in great haste even as she was reaching for the axe hanging at her side.\nThis got me to thinking about other Orcish expressions that contained the ubiquitous word. For example, \"By &lt;a href=\"Malacath\"&gt;Malacath's&lt;/a&gt; tusk!\" This seems to be an all-purpose exclamation that substitutes the proper noun with any of a multitude of famous or infamous Orcs. I've heard Orcs swear by the tusks of Malacath, &lt;a href=\"Trinimac\"&gt;Trinimac&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Kurog%20gro-Orsinium\"&gt;Kurog&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Bazrag\"&gt;Bazrag&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Alga\"&gt;Forge-Mother Alga&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Urtho%20the%20Flatulent\"&gt;Urtho the Flatulent&lt;/a&gt;, and even heath-mothers and ancient ancestors that no one but the Orc making the exclamation even remembers. And for variety, the forsworn tusks might be chipped, cracked, broken, missing, pierced, or any of myriad of shades and colors.\nAnother expression I hear over and over in the &lt;a href=\"Orsinium%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Orsinium&lt;/a&gt; taverns, \"Better than a kick in the tusks,\" seems to imply that one unpleasant experience to somewhat less agreeable than another unpleasant experience. When one Orc says to another, \"I heard you fell into a pond full of leeches,\" her companion exclaims, \"Yeah, but it was better than a kick in the tusks,\" I can only conclude that no matter how horrible an ordeal and Orc suffers, there could always be something worse, I suppose that Orc's tusks are extremely sensitive and a kick must instill in them unbearable pain. Or, it's just something to say and you can't really infer anything deeper from the conversation. Orcs can be so confusing.\nBut this is just the tip of the tusk, as it were. Spend a few hours in an Orc tavern and you'll hear all kinds of expressions involving tusks. \"Tusk you!\" \"Who gives a tusk?\" \"You tusking idiot!\" \"What the tusk?\" \"Stop tusking around!\" \"Tusk me!\" And perhaps my favorite, \"Go tusk yourself,\" which at first glance seems to be an impossible request, but I've seen what an Orc tuck can do to flesh and blood. An Orc must really dislike the person he or she offers this fierce suggestion to.\nI decided to make one more attempt to get an Orc to discuss the topic of tusks with me. This time I chose a striking young female who was seated by herself in a dark corner, making her way to the bottom of a bottle of Orsinium pink zinfandel. I asked if she'd be willing to talk about the many used for the word \"tusk\" in the Orcish vocabulary.\nTusk no!\" she told me in uncertain terms. Nevertheless, I pressed the issue.\nAre you tusking kidding me?\" she asked, When I assured her I wasn't \"tusking kidding her,\" she balled up her fist and knocked me on my arse.\n\"Tusk!\" I exclaimed. And I finally understood the true meaning of the word."}

The tusked people claim occupancy of our fair realm, stretching back before the time &lt;a href=\"Ysgramor%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Ysgramor&lt;/a&gt; crossed the &lt;a href=\"Sea%20of%20Ghosts\"&gt;Sea of Ghosts&lt;/a&gt;. Though few written accounts still exist of that time, there is mention in the histories of the &lt;a href=\"Five%20Hundred%20Companions\"&gt;Companions&lt;/a&gt; uprooting &lt;a href=\"Orc%20Strongholds\"&gt;Orc strongholds&lt;/a&gt; even as they burned the &lt;a href=\"Snow%20Elf\"&gt;Snow Elves&lt;/a&gt; from the land.\nOrc strongholds are well defended outposts often situated around deposits of &lt;a href=\"Mining\"&gt;mineral wealth&lt;/a&gt;. Each contains the infrastructure to support a dozen or more families, surrounded by walls designed to repel anything but the strongest martial force. Many &lt;a href=\"jarl\"&gt;jarl&lt;/a&gt;s are remembered in song for dying vainly while attempting to root a stronghold from their lands. Worse, destroyed strongholds often return within a generation of their destruction if not countered by a Nord fort that needs a constant supply of troops and provisions.\nFew jarls can afford to defend piles of rock for more than a few years, and thus the Orc strongholds remain a pox upon our land. Some strongholds have persisted in this way for hundreds, if not thousands, of years. It's said that the ancient Orc stronghold of &lt;a href=\"Cradlecrush\"&gt;Cradlecrush&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Eastmarch%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Eastmarch&lt;/a&gt; has never been taken by force or abandoned, despite the complete exhaustion of the mineral vein it sits upon.\nThe height of Orcish power in Skyrim came with the establishment of Yashnag's Chiefdom in the early &lt;a href=\"Second%20Era\"&gt;Second Era&lt;/a&gt;. With the destruction of &lt;a href=\"Orsinium%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Orsinium&lt;/a&gt; by the combined &lt;a href=\"Bretons%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Breton&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Redguards%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Redguard&lt;/a&gt; forces, the Orcs were scattered across the North in a great exodus. Yashnag and his people, exiled from High Roc, fled east to reclaim lands in Skyrim they felt were theirs by ancient right. The King of &lt;a href=\"West%20Skyrim\"&gt;West Skyrim&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Svartr\"&gt;Svartr&lt;/a&gt;, was ineffective in holding back the Orcs and the &lt;a href=\"Reachmen%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Reachmen&lt;/a&gt; that plagued the &lt;a href=\"West%20Kingdom\"&gt;West Kingdom&lt;/a&gt; during his rule. The chiefdom was a bane upon &lt;a href=\"Western%20Falkreath\"&gt;Western Falkreath&lt;/a&gt; for more than thirty years, until it was burned out by &lt;a href=\"Hakkvild%20Yashnag-Slayer\"&gt;Hakkvild Yashnag-Slayer&lt;/a&gt; in the year 467 of the Second Era.\nHakkvild became Jarl of &lt;a href=\"Falkreath%20Hold%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Falkreath&lt;/a&gt; when Yashnag killed his father on the field of battle. The young jarl inherited little more than a crumbling hold largely occupied by Orcish invaders from the west. It is said that Hakkvild challenged Yashnag and a host of Yashnag's Orc champions to a ritual trial by combat. He defeated each in turn. How Hakkvild learned of this obscure Orcish ritual is not known, but with their leader's defeat, Yashnag's followers abandoned the chiefdom.\nWith the destruction of the chiefdom, the Orcs scattered further into Skyrim or back into the mountains of &lt;a href=\"Wrothgar%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Wrothgar&lt;/a&gt;. Orc clans descended from Yashnag's people have an intense hatred of the Kings of Skyrim. It's ironic that this enmity for the Nords has grown, even as the Orcs themselves have re-established ties with the peoples of western &lt;a href=\"Tamriel\"&gt;Tamriel&lt;/a&gt; that burned their first home hundreds of years ago."}

I was shocked to find that almost no scholarly work on the subject exists. It did not take me long to find out why.\nStudying the Iron Orcs proved to be a difficult endeavor given that they are uniformly hostile toward anyone perceived to be an outsider. \"Hostile\" is an understatement in this case: during my time in Craglorn I routinely found bodies hacked and cleaved, then pinned to trees with crude iron nails. This was unsettling, but informative. What could drive such brutality, I wondered. As with most things, the answer lay in the past.\nStudy of ancient &lt;a href=\"Orsimer%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Orcish&lt;/a&gt; cave paintings and &lt;a href=\"Nede%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Nedic&lt;/a&gt; ruins revealed a surprising number of stylistic similarities. These shared motifs clearly indicate a rich cultural exchange between primitive Orcs and Nedes. Abandonment of this shared symbology appears to have been gradual, indicating a prolonged period of estrangement. Conflicts became more common and intense during periods of rapid Nedic advancement in metal and stonecraft. Numerous Nedic frescos depict armored warriors in conflict with unarmored Orcs. We can only assume that these paintings depicted actual military victories against their less developed neighbors.\nAt some point in the late &lt;a href=\"Merethic%20Era\"&gt;Merethic Era&lt;/a&gt;, a fundamental rearrangement of Iron Orc civilization occurred. What had been a largely peaceful, shamanistic society rapidly transformed into a community of miners, smiths, and warriors\u2014much more in keeping with the conventional Orsimeric narrative. There were some notable differences, however. The Iron Orcs adopted a warfare methodology that was almost bestial in nature. My associates and I discovered a series of mass graves filled with corpses in every state of disrepair\u2014broken spines, shattered skulls, cracked ribcages. Most of these injuries were sustained after the killing blow, and many of the corpses bore no weapons or armor of any kind.\nI believe the evidence we uncovered in Craglorn paints a compelling narrative. The Iron Orcs (whose reverence for stone persists to this day) were driven to mining and war by a desperate need to defend themselves and the pristine stones they worshipped. In taking up the pick and spade, they were committing a dreadful blasphemy. Anger eventually gave way to hatred\u2014specifically for the Nedes who drove them to this sacrilege. If this interpretation is accurate, we can conclude that Iron Orc anger is anger of the most dangerous kind: anger driven by self-loathing. In order to protect their culture and the stone they worship, they had to twist both into something dark and horrifying. I fear that it is an anger and quiet sadness too dark and deep to ever truly recover from. We can only hope for a cultural shift from within their own ranks. I suspect we will be waiting a long time."}

He was said to have slain hundreds of &lt;a href=\"Orcs\"&gt;Orcs&lt;/a&gt; by that time, and nonetheless, many fighters of the Order still live by his Credo, \"the best techniques are passed on by the survivors...\" Any Initiate wishing to join the Order must play the role of the Orsimer in the annual reenactment of the Siege of Orsinium."}

{"id": "2980", "revid": "3246801", "url": "https://elderscrolls.fandom.com/wiki?curid=2980", "title": "Order of the Black Worm", "text": "The Order of the Black Worm, also known as the Cult of the Black Worm, the Worm Cult, or the Fellowship of Anchorites, is a magical organization consisting largely of &lt;a href=\"necromancers\"&gt;necromancers&lt;/a&gt;. They follow the teachings of &lt;a href=\"Mannimarco\"&gt;Mannimarco&lt;/a&gt;, their \"King of Worms\". They are traditionally rivals of the Mages Guild, as well as &lt;a href=\"Arkay\"&gt;Arkay&lt;/a&gt; and his priesthood. The latter are usually humiliated by members of the Worm Cult, who are given guidance by followers of the Cult in Cyrodiil.\nEquipment.\nThe Worm Cult has had various kinds of gear. During the &lt;a href=\"Alliance%20War\"&gt;Alliance War&lt;/a&gt;, the cult had styles for armor and weapons in order to defend themselves while advancing the goals of &lt;a href=\"Molag%20Bal\"&gt;Molag Bal&lt;/a&gt;. In later time periods, their equipment became more basic, until eventually being replaced by simple robes during the Oblivion Crisis. The robes worn by members of the cult are typically black.\nMagic.\nThe necromancers of the Worm Cult use both regular magic, as well as spells to summon beings such as skeletons, ghosts, or zombies. In rituals, the necromancers mark their undead, or living, minions. Other magic used by the worm cult is the ability to reanimate the dead, a feature which they sometimes use at graveyards. Rumors also exist that the Worm Cult knows rituals which enable sacrificed souls to go to a Daedric Prince, rather than Aetherius. Magic for binding spirits is also known by the Worm Cult, and requires a ritual, where as Animus Geodes are used to hold the souls of multiple people. The Geodes are fragile, meaning they can easily be smashed and the souls kept in them be set free. During the Alliance War, the members of the Worm Cult also knew how to summon &lt;a href=\"Dark%20Anchor\"&gt;Dark Anchor&lt;/a&gt;s.\nAnother art of the necromancers is the creation of black soul gems, which became possible following the Warp in the West. This art enabled them to capture the souls of the sentient races of Tamriel; man, elf, and beast. In order to make the soul gems, a grand soul gem had to be placed in an altar, after which the necromancer had to pray for Mannimarco's blessing, while striking the altar with soul trap magic. This allowed Mannimarco's power to change the soul gem from grand to black.\nRanking.\nLocations where the members of the Order are located are informally known as \"Worm Nests\", and are led by Worm Anchorites, who are the highest ranking members below Mannimarco. Sometimes, these Anchorites are undead. When they are undead, they are known as Worm Eremites. These Anchorites report directly to the King of Worms through an unknown means of communication. Beneath the Ancorites are the Necromancer Adepts, Worm Warriors, and Worm Thralls. New members of the Order are attracted by its promises of power, and are sworn to secrecy under the threat of undeath. Those who join have to cut ties with their former lives, as distractions are not permitted within the cult.\nHistory.\n&lt;a href=\"Second%20Era\"&gt;Second Era&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe Worm Cult would find its origins around the same time the Mages Guild was founded. Mannimarco, upon being discovered as a necromancer by the &lt;a href=\"Psijic%20Order\"&gt;Psijic Order&lt;/a&gt; was exiled to mainland &lt;a href=\"Tamriel\"&gt;Tamriel&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Vanus%20Galerion\"&gt;Vanus Galerion&lt;/a&gt; saw this punishment as too light. He left the Psijics to form the Mages Guild. While Galerion was establishing the Mages Guild, Mannimarco was spreading the art of &lt;a href=\"necromancy\"&gt;necromancy&lt;/a&gt; across Tamriel, and recruiting necromancers to gather artifacts to increase his power, and would eventually use this power to turn himself into a Lich. In doing this, he learned the ways the Dragon Priests used to enthrall their draugr, as well as the Ayleid magics regarding the summoning of their spirits. He also obtained the Crimson Book of Skulls, a book which Arch-Mage &lt;a href=\"Shalidor\"&gt;Shalidor&lt;/a&gt; himself thought was destroyed.\nIn &lt;a href=\"2E%20437\"&gt;2E 437&lt;/a&gt;, the presence of the Order of the Black Worm in &lt;a href=\"Kvatch\"&gt;Kvatch&lt;/a&gt; was discovered, and beaten by the &lt;a href=\"Order%20of%20the%20Hour\"&gt;Order of the Hour&lt;/a&gt;. Rusio Olo defeated eight of the cultists single-handedly, including their leader.\n&lt;a href=\"Alliance%20War\"&gt;Alliance War&lt;/a&gt;.\nDuring the Alliance War, the Mages Guild lost the &lt;a href=\"Arcane%20University\"&gt;Arcane University&lt;/a&gt; in Cyrodiil to the Worm Cult, who made it their home. The &lt;a href=\"Soulburst\"&gt;Soulburst&lt;/a&gt; had also enable the Necromancers to summon undead on a scale which was previously impossible. The Worm Cult was in general active throughout Tamriel, as they were responsible for calling down the Dark Anchors.\nHammerfell.\nWithin Hammerfell, the Worm Cult used their arts to create armies of undead, as the Redguards are culturally not permitted to slay the undead. However, their attempts were foiled by the &lt;a href=\"Ash%27abah\"&gt;Ash'abah&lt;/a&gt;. Within &lt;a href=\"Elinhir\"&gt;Elinhir&lt;/a&gt;, the Mages Guild provided continued resistance against the Worm Cult, preventing Molag Bal from gaining a hold there, though the city would later be lost to the &lt;a href=\"Scaled%20Court\"&gt;Scaled Court&lt;/a&gt;.\nMorrowind.\nWithin the ruins of &lt;a href=\"Ashalmawia\"&gt;Ashalmawia&lt;/a&gt; on &lt;a href=\"Vvardenfell\"&gt;Vvardenfell&lt;/a&gt;, the Worm Cult was practicing rituals, which were disrupted by the &lt;a href=\"Vestige\"&gt;Vestige&lt;/a&gt;.\nValenwood.\nWithin Valenwood's region of &lt;a href=\"Malabal%20Tor\"&gt;Malabal Tor&lt;/a&gt;, the Worm Cult was resurrecting mammoths to do their bidding, and took over the &lt;a href=\"Treehenge\"&gt;Treehenge&lt;/a&gt; from the Bosmer, resulting in the local &lt;a href=\"spriggan\"&gt;spriggan&lt;/a&gt;s becoming aggressive to their keepers. The Worm Cult was attempting to gain the soul of &lt;a href=\"Finoriell\"&gt;Finoriell&lt;/a&gt;, the Green Lady, seeking to use it in order to create an abomination. Through tormenting the spriggans, the Worm Cult hoped to prevent the soul of Finoriell from becoming one with the treehenge. In a desperate attempt, a Worm Cult Warlock tried to absorb her soul, but was stopped by the Vestige. They also aided Molag Bal in keeping a hold over &lt;a href=\"Gil-Var-Delle\"&gt;Gil-Var-Delle&lt;/a&gt;, until being beaten back by the Vestige.\nAt the ruins of &lt;a href=\"Abamath\"&gt;Abamath&lt;/a&gt;, the Worm Cult intended to sacrifice a number of Bosmer to Molag Bal. The ruins were said to house the \"blood of Mauloch\", which the Cult aimed to use in order to summon Mauloch onto Tamriel, which would devastate Valenwood. Mauloch would serve as an unwitting puppet of Molag Bal in doing so, as the Worm Cult could resurrect the Bosmer killed by Mauloch. They were also trying to resurrect a long-dead Ayleid Lord known as Ceyran from his resting place in &lt;a href=\"Rulanyil%27s%20Fall\"&gt;Rulanyil's Fall&lt;/a&gt;, in order to use his power to wreak havoc in Greenshade.\nAt the &lt;a href=\"Bone%20Orchard\"&gt;Bone Orchard&lt;/a&gt; the necromancers were assembling new skeletons to do their bidding. Using these skeletons, the worm cult started digging at the orchard, trying to dig up the bigger bones of dragons, mammoths, and other large creatures deep underneath the soil and roots. While their progress was going well, the Vestige stopped their attempts by defeating the cultists.\nWrothgar.\nIn Wrothgar, the Worm Cult sought to unleash the Daedra Zandadunoz the Reborn, which would provide them with the means to sweep over Wrothgar. Their plans were stopped, however, when Zandadunoz was defeated by the Vestige.\nBlack Marsh.\nWhile less active in &lt;a href=\"Black%20Marsh\"&gt;Black Marsh&lt;/a&gt; than in the other provinces, in &lt;a href=\"Stillrise%20Village\"&gt;Stillrise Village&lt;/a&gt; the Worm Cult had learned of the secrets of its inhabitants, as they were undead. The Vestige had to aid the local &lt;a href=\"Kothringi\"&gt;Kothringi&lt;/a&gt; undead in stopping the Worm Cult from taking over their bodies.\nCyrodiil.\nThe most activity of the Worm Cult in Cyrodiil was found in the Imperial City, where they thought they would be in charge of the city. In reality, their duties largely consisted of doing tasks for the &lt;a href=\"Dremora\"&gt;Dremora&lt;/a&gt; under the command of Molag Bal. The undead in the Imperial Capital would be used by the &lt;a href=\"Drake%20of%20Blades\"&gt;Drake of Blades&lt;/a&gt; and the Vestige to uncover the secrets of the Worm Cult, which was centered in the Memorial district of the city. Through using the undead minions of the Worm Cult, information was also slowly gathered regarding their plans.\nSkyrim.\nInside &lt;a href=\"Skyrim\"&gt;Skyrim&lt;/a&gt;'s Hold of &lt;a href=\"the%20Rift\"&gt;the Rift&lt;/a&gt;, the Worm Cult held an active presence. At the ruins of &lt;a href=\"Taarengrav\"&gt;Taarengrav&lt;/a&gt;, the Worm Cult tried to obtain a powerful ally through binding the souls of the 500 Companions to the giant &lt;a href=\"Sinmur\"&gt;Sinmur&lt;/a&gt;, with similar attempts being made at Pinepeak Cavern, but their plans were stopped by the Vestige. The necromancers also killed giants so they could resurrect them to fight on their side, to provide Sinmur with an army. Within the rest of the Rift, members of the Worm Cult were frequently spotted, doing rituals, capturing travelers, attacking farms for souls, or making gateways for the Daedra to cross over to Tamriel. At Forelhost, the Worm Cult held a piece of Wuuthrad and was trying to obtain powerful artifacts, but the group which was tasked to do so was killed by Sabre Cats. Pact Soldiers would also be ambushed by the Worm Cult at &lt;a href=\"Lost%20Prospect\"&gt;Lost Prospect&lt;/a&gt;, with their souls being taken by the leader of the group, who wielded a shard of Wuuthrad. In &lt;a href=\"Nimalten\"&gt;Nimalten&lt;/a&gt;, the Worm Cult was trying to establish an outpost to help in the search for spirits to power Sinmur. These spirits would turn out to be spirits of the Companions, and were hidden in a crypt beneath Nimalten, but these plans would be thwarted by the Vestige.\nThrough collaboration with the Reachmen, the giant Sinmur was set free on the land, with the Worm Cult channeling the power of Molag Bal to the Reachmen in return, the remaining members of the Cult and the Reachmen at the Vaults of Vernim would be beaten by the Vestige before they could do more damage than they had already done. At the ruins of &lt;a href=\"Trolhetta\"&gt;Trolhetta&lt;/a&gt;, the Worm Cult was gathered and defended Sinmur with the help of giants, but Sinmur was eventually slain.\n&lt;a href=\"Third%20Era\"&gt;Third Era&lt;/a&gt;.\n&lt;a href=\"Warp%20in%20the%20West\"&gt;Warp in the West&lt;/a&gt;.\nPrincess &lt;a href=\"Morgiah\"&gt;Morgiah&lt;/a&gt; would make a deal with Mannimarco and his Worm Cult in &lt;a href=\"3E%20405\"&gt;3E 405&lt;/a&gt;. Hidden in &lt;a href=\"Scourg%20Barrow\"&gt;Scourg Barrow&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"the%20Agent\"&gt;the Agent&lt;/a&gt; was tasked with delivering the message. With the deal being made, Mannimarco was able to expand his influence in &lt;a href=\"Firsthold\"&gt;Firsthold&lt;/a&gt; on &lt;a href=\"Summerset\"&gt;Summerset&lt;/a&gt;. Mannimarco would later again ask the Agent for help, this time in learning the magical skills of the ghost of Prince Karolis of &lt;a href=\"Sentinel\"&gt;Sentinel&lt;/a&gt;. After doing so, the necromancer provided the Agent with some information regarding the identity of the &lt;a href=\"Underking\"&gt;Underking&lt;/a&gt;. As part of the Warp in the West, Mannimarco uses the &lt;a href=\"Mantella\"&gt;Mantella&lt;/a&gt; to turn himself into a God of &lt;a href=\"Oblivion\"&gt;Oblivion&lt;/a&gt;. Following this, the God of Worms used his new power to create the Revenant, also known as the Necromancer's Moon. During this time, Grand Soul Gems were able to be turned into Black Soul Gems, as Mannimarco held power over during the Revenant.\n&lt;a href=\"Oblivion%20Crisis\"&gt;Oblivion Crisis&lt;/a&gt;.\nJust before the Oblivion Crisis, the practice of necromancy was officially outlawed in the Mages Guild. &lt;a href=\"Hannibal%20Traven%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;Hannibal Traven&lt;/a&gt; was considered the first to take such a hard stance on necromancy, refusing to even do business with those involved with the art, and made many enemies in doing so. With the ban in place, many people chose to leave the Mages Guild, alongside half the council of mages.\nDuring the crisis itself, the ban would see the Mages Guild suffer to the Worm Cult. The head of the &lt;a href=\"Cheydinhal\"&gt;Cheydinhal&lt;/a&gt; chapter of the Mages Guild, known as &lt;a href=\"Falcar\"&gt;Falcar&lt;/a&gt;, was a member of the Worm Cult, and tried to sabotage the guild by sending new members on a near-impossible task. Within the province of Cyrodiil, the necromancers had many hidden outposts, with some having Necromancer Altars, which they used for the creation of Black Soul Gems. The Cult also killed the Mages at the grove where the Mages Staves were created, near &lt;a href=\"Wellspring%20Cave\"&gt;Wellspring Cave&lt;/a&gt;, and held a presence in the city of &lt;a href=\"Skingrad\"&gt;Skingrad&lt;/a&gt; until its agents there were killed. Not long after, Mannimarco himself had come to Cyrodiil, making his base in Echo Cave. The news of Mannimarco's return shook the Council of Mages, and while they were in disarray on how to continue, the Worm Cult had attack the Bruma Guild Hall, destroying it and setting it on fire. With the news of the destruction of the Bruma Guild Hall, the Council of Mages shattered and dissolved. A member of the Council, known as &lt;a href=\"Irlav%20Jarol\"&gt;Irlav Jarol&lt;/a&gt;, took the Bloodworm Helm with him to study it in order to use its power against Mannimarco, but was killed while doing so. Another member of the Council, &lt;a href=\"Caranya\"&gt;Caranya&lt;/a&gt;, took the &lt;a href=\"Necromancer%27s%20Amulet\"&gt;Necromancer's Amulet&lt;/a&gt; with her. But rather than study it to fight Mannimarco, she wanted to give the Amulet to the King of Worms. After these artifacts were returned to the Guild, the Worm Cult was already working on creating another powerful item. The &lt;a href=\"Colossal%20Black%20Soul%20Gem\"&gt;Colossal Black Soul Gem&lt;/a&gt; was being crafted in &lt;a href=\"Silorn\"&gt;Silorn&lt;/a&gt;, which had to be taken from the cult. The soul gem was designed to house the soul of Hannibal Traven, and was meant to give Mannimarco his power. Traven would sacrifice himself so the new Arch-Mage could face Mannimarco in battle without being enthralled. Fighting their way through Echo Cave's necromancers, Traven's pupil faced Mannimarco and killed him, destroying the Worm Cult in the process.\n&lt;a href=\"Fourth%20Era\"&gt;Fourth Era&lt;/a&gt;.\nBy the time of the Fourth Era the Order was practically extinct. Because of this, a coven of necromancers in &lt;a href=\"Hob%27s%20Fall%20Cave\"&gt;Hob's Fall Cave&lt;/a&gt; pleaded to the Revenant in an attempt to restore the Order in &lt;a href=\"4E%20201\"&gt;4E 201&lt;/a&gt;.\nArtifacts.\n&lt;a href=\"Necromancer%27s%20Amulet\"&gt;Necromancer's Amulet&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe Necromancer's Amulet is an artifact said to have been created by Mannimarco himself. Its wearer is able to regenerate from injuries, as well as absorb magicka. Another power of the artifact is making the bearer incredibly wise. However, the Amulet is unstable, as it constantly fades in and out of existence.\n&lt;a href=\"Bloodworm%20Helm\"&gt;Bloodworm Helm&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe Bloodworm Helm is, much like the Necromancer's Amulet, an artifact which used to belong to Mannimarco himself. It is constructed of magically formed bone, and allows the user to summon skeletons and control the undead.\n&lt;a href=\"Staff%20of%20Worms\"&gt;Staff of Worms&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe personal Staff of Mannimarco, which was lost to him after he was killed during the Oblivion Crisis."}

The Order enforces the will of Akatosh and the Chantry, having influence from &lt;a href=\"Kvatch\"&gt;Kvatch&lt;/a&gt; to &lt;a href=\"Wayrest\"&gt;Wayrest&lt;/a&gt;.\nHistory.\nFirst Era.\nFounding.\nThe Order of the Hour is originally a knightly order of Cyrodiil, created in the First Era by Ennon Descan as an order dedicated to Akatosh. Originally the order drew members from the priesthood and military alike. It fell into obscurity during the Second Era, until it was reformed in 2E 432.\nSecond Era.\nIn the year 432 of the Second Era, the Order was reformed by a warrior-priest of Akatosh, known as Cavor Merula. This happened as a result of the collapse of the &lt;a href=\"Second%20Empire\"&gt;Second Empire&lt;/a&gt; and the rise of the &lt;a href=\"Longhouse%20Emperors\"&gt;Longhouse Emperors&lt;/a&gt;, the Order feared that Akatosh's priesthood would be under threat. Alongside some devoted and trusted fellow priests, Merula came to the Cathedral in Kvatch, to protect the Cathedral itself, alongside its historic and religious treasures. Soon after, soldiers and warrior-priests dedicated to Akatosh began joining the Order, ironically, despite all the preparation, the Longhouse Emperors never tried to harm the order of Akatosh. As a result, the Order turned into an elite bodyguard devoted to the Chapel of Akatosh and its primate, who is the leader of Akatosh's faith. After this point, the Order turned into more of a ceremonial than military organisation, though it did continue following its training for the event of someone trying to harm the faith.\nIn 2E 437, the Order had its first assault against heretics, as they fought the &lt;a href=\"Order%20of%20the%20Black%20Worm\"&gt;Order of the Black Worm&lt;/a&gt;. Led by Rusio Olo, one of the first warrior-priests to join the order, the Knights took down the Black Worm's cultists in Kvatch, with Rusio himself killing eight cultists and their leader.\nWhen in &lt;a href=\"2E%20467\"&gt;2E 467&lt;/a&gt; the &lt;a href=\"Kvatch%20Bread%20Riots\"&gt;Kvatch Bread Riots&lt;/a&gt; broke out due to the failure of the harvest of wheat due to a blight for the second year in a row. The people blamed the chapel, as they thought the priesthood was not doing enough to compensate for the damage. Gruff Bojour, the leader of the rabble, led a mob wielding axes and torches to the Cathedral, with the intention of causing damage to the Cathedral and making their situation known. However, the Order was prepared for this would-be assault, and the warrior-priests of Order, under command of Sister Severa, slaughtered half of Bojour's men before the first torch had been thrown. The riots did have a positive result for the common folk, as the Primate promised to pray for the blight to stop, which worked, as the next season the blight was gone.\nThroughout the Second Era, the Order has performed numerous similar acts, most of which are related to religious figures. They saved Primate Phrastus from an assassin, rescued a caravan of pilgrims and priests from bandits. They did this due to their vow to serve and protect the Chapel of Akatosh, with the priests and pilgrims being considered part of that. In 2E 480, the Primate of Akatosh wrote a writ which declared that the Order of the Hour, while normally not being very militaristic, would be allowed to form an army in the event that religious emergencies were to take place. This army was able to stop a horde of bandits led by an Orc named Baz Swordbreaker. After beating the bandits, the army was disbanded and the priests returned to their normal duties.\nWhen the Gold Coast seperated itself from Cyrodiil after the collapse of the Empire and the start of the &lt;a href=\"Three%20Banners%20War\"&gt;Three Banners War&lt;/a&gt;, Primate Artorius Ponticus set out to increase the power and size of the Order. During the Alliance War, threats against Kvatch and its Catherdral became a dangerous thing, resulting in the Count of Kvatch granting the Order the right to turn into an army again. As of &lt;a href=\"2E%20582\"&gt;2E 582&lt;/a&gt;, the Order had the largest force since the day of its founding, consisting of a mixed group of Akatosh warrior-priests and dedicated soldiers of faith filling its ranks, as a result, the Order took on most of the guard duties in the City of Kvatch.\n&lt;a href=\"Kvatch\"&gt;Kvatch&lt;/a&gt; Chapter of the Order of the Hour gained significant power in Kvatch. The leader at the time, &lt;a href=\"Primate%20Artorius\"&gt;Primate Artorius&lt;/a&gt;, gathered many new warriors to the Order of the Hour, and waged war on the &lt;a href=\"Dark%20Brotherhood\"&gt;Dark Brotherhood&lt;/a&gt; in the area, culminating in the deaths of Brotherhood members, Order warriors, and Primate Artorius himself. The Knights also fought in the Arena of Kvatch, in the show known as \"The Circle of Penance.\" Heretics were given one last chance to repent for their sins, by beating the Knights in the Arena their sins were forgiven.\nThird Era.\nAround &lt;a href=\"3E%20405\"&gt;3E 405&lt;/a&gt;, the regions of &lt;a href=\"Wayrest\"&gt;Wayrest&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Isle%20of%20Balfiera\"&gt;Isle of Balfiera&lt;/a&gt; in High Rock and &lt;a href=\"Bergama\"&gt;Bergama&lt;/a&gt; in Hammerfell had Akatosh as their head deity, and had a number of Order of the Hour temples. Other smaller temples were likewise scattered across the Iliac Bay. The Order of the Hour, like most of the Templar Orders in the Bay, concerned itself with exorcisms, curing the ill, slaying the undead, finding holy relics, destroying or securing cursed artifacts, working against hauntings and investigating heretical tales.\nDragons were also defended by the Akatosh Chantry and the Order of the Hour in sacred groves in the Iliac Bay. On the occassions where members of the Order of the Hour would slay these Dragons, another member would be sent out to defeat the Dragonslayer for murdering the Dragons.\nFourth Era.\nThe Order had a Temple of Akatosh in &lt;a href=\"Wayrest\"&gt;Wayrest&lt;/a&gt; around &lt;a href=\"4E%20188\"&gt;4E 188&lt;/a&gt;. One of the members, Brother &lt;a href=\"Markam%20Hawksmire\"&gt;Markam Hawksmire&lt;/a&gt;, was an assassination target of the Dark Brotherhood, as he was said to be corrupt. His assassination was planned by Kastus Thorn.\nLocations.\n&lt;a href=\"Knightsgrave\"&gt;Knightsgrave&lt;/a&gt;.\nOne of the locations that the Order of the Hour has a close connection to is the ruin of &lt;a href=\"Knightsgrave\"&gt;Knightsgrave&lt;/a&gt;. In the days of the founding of the Order, Knightsgrave was the headquarters of the Order of the Hour. The loction would continue to be the headquarters for 100 years after the death of Ennon Decan. In this time period, the location increased in size, with more rooms getting carved out of the rock. When the Order first disbanded, Knightsgrave was given to the Catherdral of Akatosh for safekeeping, the Catherdral, however, did not know how what to do with Knightsgrave, and decided to turn the location into a crypt, with every honored dead of the Order of the Hour being burried within. At the very end of the ruin, a huge carved out rock representing Akatosh can be seen.\n&lt;a href=\"Enclave%20of%20the%20Hourglass\"&gt;Enclave of the Hourglass&lt;/a&gt;.\nWhen Cavor Merula reformed the Order he wanted to dedicate Knightsgrave to the memory of the Order's founding members, through blessings and rituals. However, due to this disturbing the dead, Cavor instead build the Enclave of the Hourglass as a new headquarter for the Order.\nJoining the Order.\nPeople who wish to join the Order of the Hour have to be devout followers of Akatosh and unmarried. Originally only priests could join the order, but as time passed non-clergy were allowed to join. If one is allowed to join the Order, they go through enhanced training in combat and skills required to keep the Cathedral of Akatosh safe. After joining the order, and completing the training, members have to choose how they will spread the faith. Either they become a Chanter or a Sermonizer. Chanters aid through prayer and guidance, hearing the pleas of the people who visit Akatosh's Cathedral, teaching the ways of Akatosh, and aiding worshipers with their offerings and rituals so they grow closer to Akatosh. The Sermonizers go to the street to spread the word of Akatosh, following the Grand Sermonizer. The Sermonizers purge heretics, and are the more inquisitive one of two. New chanters of sermonizers answer to grand chanters and grand sermonizers, who in turn, answer to the Primate. Those who truly join the Order itself are more militaristic. While Chanters and Sermonizers are part of the Order, the true Order of the Hour is the one of its knights."}

It was born early in the life of the Empire, during the &lt;a href=\"First%20Era\"&gt;First Era&lt;/a&gt;, and eventually faded into obscurity during the &lt;a href=\"Second%20Era\"&gt;Second Era&lt;/a&gt;. It was founded by &lt;a href=\"Ennon%20Decan\"&gt;Ennon Decan&lt;/a&gt; as an order of knights dedicated to Akatosh, though originally it drew its members from the priesthood and military alike.\nThe most recent incarnation of the Order of the Hour was established in &lt;a href=\"2E%20432\"&gt;2E 432&lt;/a&gt; by the warrior-priest of Akatosh, &lt;a href=\"Cavor%20Merula\"&gt;Cavor Merula&lt;/a&gt;, in response to the collapse of the &lt;a href=\"Second%20Empire\"&gt;Second Empire&lt;/a&gt; and the coming of the &lt;a href=\"Longhouse%20Emperors\"&gt;Longhouse Emperors&lt;/a&gt;. Fearing for the safety of the Dragon God priesthood and wanting to protect the &lt;a href=\"Cathedral%20of%20Akatosh\"&gt;Cathedral of Akatosh&lt;/a&gt; and its many historic and religiously significant treasures, Cavor gathered a few devoted and trusted fellow priests and dedicated himself and his brothers to the defense of the Cathedral. On that day, the Order of the Hour was reborn.\nSoon, devout soldiers and warrior-priests in service to Akatosh began to flock to the Order's banner. The feared retribution against the Divines by the Longhouse Emperors never materialized, however, and the Order of the Hour transformed into a small but elite unit of bodyguards devoted to the Cathedral and its resident Primate, the leader of the Akatosh faith. In many ways, the Order of the Hour developed into a mostly ceremonial organization, although they maintained their training and combat readiness. When the occasional threat did strike from the shadows, the Order was prepared.\nTake, for example, the &lt;a href=\"Kvatch%20Bread%20Riots\"&gt;Kvatch Bread Riots&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"2E%20467\"&gt;2E 467&lt;/a&gt;. The common folk, fearful and angry due to the &lt;a href=\"Red%20Wheat\"&gt;Red Wheat&lt;/a&gt; blight that devastated crops for the second year in a row, decided that Akatosh and his priests weren't doing enough to rectify the situation. &lt;a href=\"Gruff%20Bojour\"&gt;Gruff Bojour&lt;/a&gt; led an ax- and torch-bearing mob to the very steps of the Cathedral, intent on inflicting violence and making their displeasure known. But the Order of the Hour was ready for the assault, and Sister Severa and her warrior-priests slaughtered half the crowd before even a single torch had been thrown. The Primate promised to pray to end the tribulation, and by the next season the blight had run its course.\nOther examples of the bravery and dedication of the Order of the Hour exist, including saving &lt;a href=\"Primate%20Phrastus\"&gt;Primate Phrastus&lt;/a&gt; from an assassin's blade in &lt;a href=\"2E%20540\"&gt;2E 540&lt;/a&gt; and rescuing a caravan of priests and pilgrims from bandits in &lt;a href=\"2E%20561\"&gt;2E 561&lt;/a&gt;. The Order has never wavered from its vow to serve and protect the Cathedral, and by extension, the priests and worshipers who occupy the holy place.\nIn &lt;a href=\"2E%20480\"&gt;2E 480&lt;/a&gt;, a writ from the Primate of Akatosh authorized the Order to form into an army during times of religious emergencies. Answering only to religious authority, the militarized Order took to the walls of Kvatch to protect the city from a horde of brigands led by the charismatic Orc marauder, &lt;a href=\"Baz%20Swordbreaker\"&gt;Baz Swordbreaker&lt;/a&gt;. Thanks to the efforts of the Order, the brigands were defeated and the city saved. Immediately thereafter, the army disbanded and the Order returned to its regular duties at the Cathedral.\nRecruits to the Order must be devout followers of Akatosh, unmarried so that they may devote themselves fully to the Order and its intense regimens. While the Order began as a small group of warrior-priests, the organization has recently broadened its acceptance criteria so that non-clergy can undertake the vows. Once indoctrinated into the Order, members undergo enhanced training in combat and skills related to keeping the Cathedral safe.\nWhen the &lt;a href=\"Gold%20Coast\"&gt;Gold Coast&lt;/a&gt; isolated itself from Cyrodiil after the Empire collapsed and the &lt;a href=\"Three%20Banners%20War\"&gt;Three Banners War&lt;/a&gt; began, &lt;a href=\"Artorius%20Ponticus\"&gt;Artorius Ponticus&lt;/a&gt;, Primate of Kvatch, immediately set out to bolster the power and scope of the Order of the Hour. He instructed &lt;a href=\"Commander%20Marcus%20Scipio\"&gt;Commander Marcus Scipio&lt;/a&gt; to increase the size of the Order and set about expanding the Order's responsibilities beyond the boundaries of the Cathedral and into the rest of the city of Kvatch. This was done, as the Primate has said on numerous occasions, \"To reinforce the capabilities of the Kvatch Guard in these dangerous and troubling times.\" As anyone can plainly see, the Primate has only the best interests of Kvatch and its people in mind.\nWith recent threats against the city and the Cathedral, the &lt;a href=\"Count%20Carolus%20Aquilarios\"&gt;Count of Kvatch&lt;/a&gt; has granted the Primate of Akatosh emergency powers to once again convert the Order into an army. Today, the Order of the Hour boasts the largest force in the history of the organization. With a mix of devoted warrior-priests and dedicated soldiers of faith filling its growing ranks, the Order now maintains the safety and keeps the peace of not only the Cathedral of Akatosh's grounds, but of all of Kvatch as well. No matter how chaotic things get on the other side of &lt;a href=\"Varen%27s%20Wall%20%28Location%29\"&gt;Varen's Wall&lt;/a&gt;, on the Kvatch side, the Order has things well in hand."}

Originally, the order was created when Galerion realized that money does not bring loyalty for the Guild, so the Order of the Lamp was created to instate this. The Palatinus of the Order is one of the six types of leaders that govern over the Mages Guild. Years later, &lt;a href=\"Mannimarco\"&gt;Mannimarco&lt;/a&gt;, the King of Worms began to spread his teachings of &lt;a href=\"Necromancy\"&gt;Necromancy&lt;/a&gt; to the populace of Tamriel, much to the dismay of Vanus Galerion. Vanus Galerion confronted Mannimarco, and a great battle ensued between Galerion's Mages and Mannimarco's undead army. The Order of the Lamp partook in the conflict against Mannimarco. In the end, Galerion had defeated Mannimarco, but unfortunately, Mannimarco had already transcended into a &lt;a href=\"Lich\"&gt;Lich&lt;/a&gt; and escaped.\n&lt;a href=\"Third%20Era\"&gt;Third Era&lt;/a&gt;.\nDuring the &lt;a href=\"Warp%20in%20the%20West\"&gt;Warp in the West&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"3E%20405\"&gt;3E 405&lt;/a&gt;, the Order of the Lamp had operated out of the &lt;a href=\"Phrygias\"&gt;Barony of Phrygias&lt;/a&gt;, located in the northernmost point of the &lt;a href=\"Iliac%20Bay\"&gt;Iliac Bay&lt;/a&gt;. The Archmagisters of the Mages Guild had utilized them to apprehend Mages who have committed acts of crime in the Magician community. In &lt;a href=\"3E%20433\"&gt;3E 433&lt;/a&gt;, there were large debates on whether Necromancy is an issue or not and one person of the Guild who supported the act was &lt;a href=\"Ulliceta%20gra-Kogg\"&gt;Ulliceta gra-Kogg&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"Orsinium\"&gt;Orsinium&lt;/a&gt;. It was later revealed that she was a Necromancer herself and the Order of the Lamp apprehended her by order of &lt;a href=\"Hannibal%20Traven%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;Hannibal Traven&lt;/a&gt;. Traven was someone who can be considered the bane of Necromancy, actively hunting down the Necromantic Cells throughout Tamriel, from the Iliac Bay to the desolate island of &lt;a href=\"Olenveld\"&gt;Olenveld&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;a href=\"Sea%20of%20Ghosts\"&gt;Sea of Ghosts&lt;/a&gt;."}

Basically, they kill vampires to cleanse &lt;a href=\"Cyrodiil\"&gt;Cyrodiil&lt;/a&gt;. Their first target is Roland Jenseric, whom Seridur claims to have witnessed bite and kill his own girlfriend, Relfina. He explains that Roland has escaped to an unknown location, but that the Hero could search his house to find out more.\nGo to Roland's house and pick the locked door. When inside, look for a &lt;a href=\"Love%20Letter%20from%20Relfina\"&gt;letter&lt;/a&gt; sitting on a table on the left and read it.

Enter and confront Roland. One can either kill him outright for 250 , or listen to his story.\nIf given the chance, he will explain that Seridur is in fact the vampire. He saw his lover attacked by Seridur while she was out on a walk. Roland further refers them to &lt;a href=\"Phintias\"&gt;Phintias&lt;/a&gt; at &lt;a href=\"First%20Edition%20%28Location%29\"&gt;First Edition&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;a href=\"Imperial%20City%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;Imperial City&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Market%20District\"&gt;Market District&lt;/a&gt; if they want further proof of Seridur's outings. Talking to Phintias reveals that Seridur had mentioned a cave, &lt;a href=\"Memorial%20Cave\"&gt;Memorial Cave&lt;/a&gt;, located southeast of the Imperial City.\nMemorial Cave.\nGo to Memorial Cave to begin the search for Seridur. Inside, there are several vampires and their &lt;a href=\"Undead%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;undead&lt;/a&gt; minions blocking the way (it is recommended to collect all &lt;a href=\"Vampire%20Dust%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;Vampire Dust&lt;/a&gt; when killing these vampires, as it can later be sold to Roland for 250 per unit).\nSeridur can be found deeper in the cave. Kill him and take his dust, and return to Roland in his cabin with the news. He will be very happy to hear that Seridur is dead and will tell the player to meet him back in the basement of Seridur's house.\nSeridur's basement.\nMeet him back in &lt;a href=\"Seridur%27s%20basement\"&gt;Seridur's basement&lt;/a&gt;, where he will reward the player with the &lt;a href=\"Ring%20of%20Sunfire\"&gt;Ring of Sunfire&lt;/a&gt;, which &lt;a href=\"Resist%20Disease%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;resists disease&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Reflect%20Spell\"&gt;reflects spells&lt;/a&gt;. Furthermore, Roland promises to give 250 per unit of Vampire Dust the player gives him (although he'll only accept it if it's from a vampire they killed) from that point on.\nThe Hero is now a \"\"Brother\" or \"Sister\"\" member of the faction."}

They are featured prominently in and play a large role in the events that unfold in the game. All Ordinators are equipped with an &lt;a href=\"Ebony%20Mace%20%28Morrowind%29\"&gt;Ebony Mace&lt;/a&gt;, a full set of &lt;a href=\"Indoril%20Armor\"&gt;Indoril Armor&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Expensive%20Pants\"&gt;expensive pants&lt;/a&gt;, an Indoril belt, and a torch.\nHistory.\nIt is known that at one point, the head of the Ordinators was &lt;a href=\"Rangidil%20Ketil\"&gt;Rangidil Ketil&lt;/a&gt;. Rangidil was born in &lt;a href=\"2E%20803\"&gt;2E 803&lt;/a&gt;, and died in &lt;a href=\"3E%20195\"&gt;3E 195&lt;/a&gt;, during the &lt;a href=\"Siege%20of%20Abernanit\"&gt;Siege of Abernanit&lt;/a&gt;.\nOrganization.\nThere are four orders of Ordinators. These are the Order of the Watch, the Order of War, the Order of the Inquisition, and the Order of Doctrine and Ordination. The Order of the Watch provides guard for temples and shrines. &lt;a href=\"Elam%20Andas\"&gt;Elam Andas&lt;/a&gt; is their chief. The Order of War fights the enemies of the Temple; most War Ordinators are stationed near Red Mountain. The Order of Doctrine and Ordination are militant scholars. The Order of the Inquisition identifies and suppresses heresy among priests and laymen. The chief Ordinator of Vvardenfell is Grandmaster &lt;a href=\"Berel%20Sala\"&gt;Berel Sala&lt;/a&gt; who has an office in the Hall of Justice. The four orders report to the Alma Rula in &lt;a href=\"Almalexia%20%28Tribunal%29\"&gt;Almalexia&lt;/a&gt;.\nLocations.\nOrdinators can be found in two main areas of &lt;a href=\"Vvardenfell%20%28Morrowind%29\"&gt;Vvardenfell&lt;/a&gt;, in the &lt;a href=\"Ghostgate\"&gt;Ghostgate&lt;/a&gt;, guarding the only entrance through the &lt;a href=\"Ghostfence\"&gt;Ghostfence&lt;/a&gt; into the &lt;a href=\"Red%20Mountain%20Region\"&gt;Red Mountain Region&lt;/a&gt;, and also in &lt;a href=\"Vivec%20City%20%28Morrowind%29\"&gt;Vivec City&lt;/a&gt;, Vvardenfell's largest city. It is in Vivec that they are most numerous, patrolling all of the cantons, inside as well as outside. They also have their own barracks inside &lt;a href=\"Vivec%2C%20Temple%20Canton\"&gt;temple canton&lt;/a&gt; near the &lt;a href=\"Palace%20of%20Vivec%20%28Morrowind%29\"&gt;Palace of Vivec&lt;/a&gt;. They can also be seen guarding the Shrine of &lt;a href=\"Vivec%27s%20Ashmask\"&gt;Vivec's Ashmask&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Gnisis%20%28Morrowind%29\"&gt;Gnisis&lt;/a&gt;, and few guarding the city of &lt;a href=\"Molag%20Mar%20%28Morrowind%29\"&gt;Molag Mar&lt;/a&gt;.\nArmor.\nOrdinator ranks are strictly limited to &lt;a href=\"Dunmer\"&gt;Dunmer&lt;/a&gt;, and only those Dunmer who hail from within the province of Morrowind. Ordinators are easily recognizable by their unique &lt;a href=\"Indoril%20Armor\"&gt;Indoril Armor&lt;/a&gt;\u00a0which are golden and heavily polished. The shoulder pieces possess large outward flourishes. Their masks are another unique trait, like the armor the Ordinator mask is gold in color and of a refined shape to resemble elven facial features. The mask is heavily plumed from the top of the skull to the back of the neck, the plume is also colored gold and seemingly also metallic. Ordinators will not hesitate to attack anyone else wearing it, as a crime of dishonor towards the &lt;a href=\"Tribunal\"&gt;Tribunal&lt;/a&gt;.\nBattle.\nOrdinators prove a difficult challenge on the battlefield, as their training and experience ensure their status as formidable foes. Despite this, a high-leveled &lt;a href=\"Nerevarine\"&gt;Nerevarine&lt;/a&gt; is quite able to dispatch one or more Ordinators at a time. Once an ordinator has been attacked, they will all relentlessly become hostile towards the Nerevarine. This also goes for their &lt;a href=\"High%20Ordinators\"&gt;high&lt;/a&gt; counterparts in &lt;a href=\"Mournhold%20%28Tribunal%29\"&gt;Mournhold&lt;/a&gt; as well.\nOrdinators are typically at Level 20. However, some can be found at other levels as well.\nSub-branches of Ordinators.\nHigh Ordinators.\nHigh Ordinators are the senior ranking Ordinators that guard Morrowind's capital &lt;a href=\"Mournhold%20%28Tribunal%29\"&gt;Mournhold&lt;/a&gt;. Their armor, shield and masks are very similar to their more common brethren, except for one characteristic; theirs is a mixture of purple and silver. They retain the same haughty nature of the ordinators, and are more lethal in battle.\nHands of Almalexia.\nThe Hands of Almalexia are the personal guard of &lt;a href=\"Almalexia%20%28Tribunal%29\"&gt;Almalexia&lt;/a&gt; herself. They are deemed among the best and very loyal, and are equipped with enchanted weapons and armor. When asked about this topic, Almalexia states that they are the most terrible mortal warriors in the world and should not be reckoned with. They are part of the high ordinators, and are similar in most aspects, except that their whole armor is enchanted.\nOrdinator Orders.\nThere are four orders that the Ordinators belong to, five including the &lt;a href=\"Hands%20of%20Almalexia%20%28Morrowind%29\"&gt;Hands of Almalexia&lt;/a&gt;.\nDialogue.\nBackground \"I am an Ordinator.\"\n\"We know your plan, Outlander...\"\nAfter talking to the archcanon:\n\"Faith, law, and justice.

The unemployed mercenaries roamed the Craglorn wilderness for a time as One-Sword struggled to come up with another plan to keep his band together. While camped in the wasteland southeast of &lt;a href=\"Dragonstar%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Dragonstar&lt;/a&gt;, a lone figure wandered into view of the disheartened group.\nShe had the regal bearing of an &lt;a href=\"Imperials%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Imperial&lt;/a&gt; and a confidence that allowed for no opposition. \"I bring a message from He Who Has No Season,\" she proclaimed in a loud, commanding voice. \"You are aimless wanderers in who the Serpent sees kindred spirits. Join me and the Serpent will reward you a thousandfold!\"\nOf course, Milvern One-Sword took umbrage with this stranger trying to turn his band against him. As he drew his blade and approached her, she smiled calmly and whispered, \"Serpent, protect your servant.\" Suddenly, the ghostly visage of a great snake surrounded the woman. She pointed, and the ghostly snake uncoiled and struck like lightning, piercing Milvern's armor with two sharp, venom-dripping fangs. He was dead before his body hit the ground. \"\nThe &lt;a href=\"The%20Serpent%20%28Celestial%29\"&gt;Celestial Serpent&lt;/a&gt; has sent me to gather you,\" the woman proclaimed, \"to give you purpose and glory and power beyond your imagining! I am the Regent of Serpentine Stratagems, and together we are the Scaled Court!\"\nAnd that, as far as I can determine, is how the Scaled Court came to Craglorn."}

The burning of &lt;a href=\"Corinthe\"&gt;Corinthe&lt;/a&gt;'s Grand Archive by Merrunz cultists in &lt;a href=\"1E%20463\"&gt;1E 463&lt;/a&gt; destroyed most of the region's &lt;a href=\"Merethic%20Era\"&gt;Merethic&lt;/a&gt; records, making the work of cultural historians like myself very difficult indeed. Luckily, Darloc Brae, the famed conqueror and so-called Golden Beast of &lt;a href=\"Anequina\"&gt;Anequina&lt;/a&gt;, took great pains to secure what histories remained, placing them in vaults and smaller archives throughout Elsweyr. Gaining access to these archives is no small feat for a &lt;a href=\"Altmer%20%28Online%29\"&gt;High Elf&lt;/a&gt;, I can tell you. But years of dogged persistence have borne some meager fruits.\nFrom what I can ascertain, life in Merethic Era Elsweyr was a toilsome affair. At that time, the famed sixteen kingdoms of the Khajiit were little more than competing fiefdoms, ruled by a cruel hunter-aristocracy. Severe droughts and periods of famine struck Anequina with pitiless regularity, and the constant feuding of the hunter-nobles resulted in widespread communities of youthful labor and prompting still greater famine across the region. The only check placed on the hunt-lords resided in the Temples of Two-Moons Dance. Khajiiti adepts and other Torval clergy wielded significant cultural influence, and occasionally used it to vex or even overthrow particularly vicious hunt-lords. The aristocracy chafed at these intrusions, but knew better than to challenge the adepts directly.\nAt some point in the high days of the Merethic Era. a particularly ruthless hunt-lord named Takanzin the Striped Death paid a flock of criminals to set fire to the &lt;a href=\"Rawl%27kha%20Temple\"&gt;Rawl'kha Temple&lt;/a&gt;. The clergy displaced by the blaze immediately fielded a small army of warrior-adepts to punish those responsible. The details of the conflict are lost to the ages, but the resolution was quite clear: Takanzin's forces quashed the priestly uprising and drove the remaining adepts out of the Kingdom of &lt;a href=\"Dune%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Dune&lt;/a&gt; altogether.\nSeizing the opportunity to be done with the adepts' meddling once and for all, the other hunt-lords across the northern tier of what is now Elsweyr instituted a policy of weapon confiscation. They cited the violence in Rawl'kha as evidence of the clergy's treasonous intentions and brutally suppressed any religious order that refused to comply.\nAfter an extended period of deep despondency and contemplation, the adepts turned inward\u2014cutting ties with the politics of the age and focusing entirely on self-perfection. Religious meditation was an essential part of that journey.\nIn many cultures, meditation is a quiet and motionless activity. Not so for Khajiit. Their nervous energy and focus on raw physicality drove them to adopt a lyrical, dance-like form of meditation. It couldn't have taken long for the adepts' dancing to transform into something akin to a martial art. Smooth. meditative dance gave way to swift claw-strikes and daring leaps. This should come as no surprise, given the Khajiits' predatory instincts. People possessing claws and fangs cannot be expected to remain peaceful forever!\nAfter centuries of isolation, the adepts emerged from their cloisters, bristling with martial skill and wisdom. By this point, the hunter-aristocracy was nearing its end. Disparities in wealth and influence had reached a tipping point, paving the way for a long-overdue public uprising. The adepts wasted no time sharing their hard-earned skills with the beleaguered peasantry. Within the span of a few generations, the adepts' martial arts were completely ubiquitous. All the people needed was a spark.\nIn the latter days of the Merethic Era, feuding hunt-lords from &lt;a href=\"Meirvale\"&gt;Meirvale&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Helkam\"&gt;Helkam&lt;/a&gt; drafted thousands of peasants into military service, bringing about one of the worst famines in Elsweyr's history. After three years of futile conflict, the armies of both lords turned on their masters, toppling the aristocracy in a rain of slashing claws, wind-kicks, and bone-breaking punches.\nBefore long, peasant uprisings broke out in nearby &lt;a href=\"Riverhold%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Riverhold&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Orcrest%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Orcrest&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Verkarth\"&gt;Verkarth&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Bruk%27ra\"&gt;Bruk'ra&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Ne%20Quin-al\"&gt;Ne Quin-al&lt;/a&gt;. Within a century, the regal hunter caste that had reigned over Elsweyr for thousands of years fell from power.\nWe know that the glorious dream of a farming utopia never took hold in Elsweyr. Within a few hundred years, a new brand of landed nobility ascended to the thrones of the sixteen kingdoms. But the people have never forgotten the power they wield. Despite the lack of written records, the rich oral traditions of the Khajiiti clan mothers ensure that the Cat-Folk never forget their struggles and triumphs.\nI remain an outsider here, but I cannot help but think that we approach a new tipping point in Elsweyr. The Imperial, &lt;a href=\"Euraxia%20Tharn%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Euraxia Tharn&lt;/a&gt;. is not so very different from the hunt-lords of millennia past. And if she does not learn from her missteps, she may well share their fate."}

If you'll recall my tale from last month, the young lady -- who I assure you is based on a real person -- only recognized her one true love after she had slept with practically everyone in Northpoint.\"\n\"I put it to you that neither is the case,\" said &lt;a href=\"Hallgerd\"&gt;Hallgerd&lt;/a&gt;, pouring a topper on his mug of &lt;a href=\"greef\"&gt;greef&lt;/a&gt;. \"The greatest inventions are created by extraordinary need. Must I remind you of the story I told some time ago about Arslic Oan and the invention of &lt;a href=\"Bonemold%20Armor\"&gt;bonemold&lt;/a&gt;?\"\n\"The problem with your theory is that your example is entirely fictional,\" sniffed Xiomara.\n\"I don't believe I remember the story of Arslic Oan and the invention of bonemold,\" frowned Garaz. \"Are you sure you told us?\"\n\"Well, this happened many, many, many years ago, when &lt;a href=\"Vvardenfell\"&gt;Vvardenfell&lt;/a&gt; was a beauteous green land, when &lt;a href=\"Dunmer\"&gt;Dunmer&lt;/a&gt; were &lt;a href=\"Chimer\"&gt;Chimer&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Dwemer\"&gt;Dwemer&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Nord\"&gt;Nord&lt;/a&gt; lived together in relative peace when they weren't trying to kill one another,\" Hallgerd relaxed in his chair, warming to his theme. \"When the sun and moons all hung in the sky together--\"\n\"&lt;a href=\"Tribunal\"&gt;Lord, Mother, and Wizard&lt;/a&gt;!\" grumbled Xiomara. \"If I'm going to be forced to hear your ridiculous story again, pray don't embellish and make it any longer than it has to be.\"\nThis all happened in Vvardenfell quite some time ago (said Hallgerd, ignoring Xiomara's interruption with admirable restraint) during an era of a king you would never have heard of. Arslic Oan was one of this king's nobles and very, very disagreeable fellow. Because of his allegiance to the crown, the king had felt the need to grant him a castle and land, but he didn't necessarily want him as a neighbor so the land he granted was far from civilization. Right in an area of Vvardenfell that is, even today, not quite civilized to this day. Arslic Oan built a walled stronghold and settled down with his unhappy slaves to enjoy a quiet if somewhat grim life.\nIt was not long before his stronghold's integrity was tested. A tribe of cannibalistic Nords had been living in the valley for some time, mostly dining on one another, but occasionally foraging what they liked to call dark meat, the Dunmer.\nXiomara laughed with appreciation. \"Marvelous! I don't remember that from before. It's funny how you don't hear much about the Nords' rampant cannibalism nowadays.\"\nThis was obviously, as I've said, quite some time ago (said Hallgerd, glaring at part of his audience with civil malevolence) and things were in many ways quite different. These cannibalistic Nords began attacking Arslic Oan's slaves in the fields, and then slowly grew bolder, until they held the very stronghold itself under siege. They were quite a fearsome sight you can imagine: a horde of wild-eyed men and women with dagger-like teeth filed to tear flesh, wielding massive clubs, cloaked only in the skins of their victims.\nArslic Oan assumed that if he ignored them, they'd go away.\nUnfortunately, the first thing that the Nords did was to poison the stream that carried water into the walled stronghold. All the livestock and most of the slaves died very quickly before this was discovered. There was no hope of rescue, at least for several months when the king's emissaries would come reluctantly to visit the disagreeable vassal. The next closest source of water was on the other side of the hill, so Arslic Oan sent three of his slaves with empty jugs to bring some back.\nThey were beaten with clubs and eaten before they were a few feet outside the stronghold gates. The next group he sent through he gave sticks to defend themselves. They made it a few feet farther, but were also overwhelmed, beaten, and devoured. It was obvious that better personal defensive was required. Arslic Oan went to talk to his armorer, one of his few slaves with specific talents and duties.\n\"The slaves need armor if they're going to make it to the river and back,\" he said. \"Collect every scrap of steel and iron you can find, every hinge, knife, ring, cup, everything that isn't needed to keep the walls sturdy, smelt it, and give me the most and the best armor you can, very, very quickly.\"\nThe armorer, whose name was Gorkith, was used to Arslic Oan's demands, and knew that there could be no compromise on the quality and quantity of the armor, or the speed at which he worked. He labored for thirty hours without a break - and, recall, without any water to slake his thirst as he struggled with the kiln and anvil - until finally, he had six suits of mixed-metal armor.\nSix slaves were chosen, clad in the armor, and sent with jars to collect river water. At first, the mission progressed well. The Nord attacked the armored slaves with their clubs, but they continued their march forward, warding off the blows. Gradually, however, the slaves seemed to be walking uncertainly, dazed by the endless barrage. Eventually, one by one, they fell, the armor was peeled from their bodies, and they were eaten.\n\"The slaves couldn't move quickly enough in that heavy armor you made,\" said Arslic Oan to Gorkith. \"I need you to collect all the cadavers of the poisoned livestock, strip their skin, and give me the most and the best &lt;a href=\"Leather%20Armor\"&gt;Leather Armor&lt;/a&gt; you can, very, very quickly.\"\nGorklith did as he was told, though it was a particularly repulsive task given the rancid state of the livestock. Normally it takes quite a time to treat and cure leather, so I understand, but Gorklith worked at it tirelessly, and in a half a day he had twelve suits of leather armor.\nTwelve slaves were chosen, clad in the armor, and sent with jars to collect river water. They progressed, at first, much better than the earlier expedition. Two fell almost immediately, but the others had some luck out-maneuvering their assailants while deflecting an occasional blow of the club. Several got to the river, three were able to fill up their jars, and one fellow very nearly made it back to the stronghold gates. Alas, he fell and was eaten. The Nords possessed a remarkably healthy appetite.\n\"What we need before I completely run out of slaves,\" said Arslic Oan thoughtfully to Gorkith. \"Is an armor sturdier than leather but lighter than metal.\"\nThe armorer had already considered that and taken stock of the materials available. He had thought about doing something with stone or wood, but there were practical problems with demolishing more of the stronghold. The next most prevalent stuff present in the stronghold was skinned dead bodies, hunks of muscle, fat, blood, and bone. For six hours, he toiled relentlessly until he produced eighteen suits of bonemold, the first ones ever created. Arslic Oan was somewhat dubious at the sight (and smell) but he was very thirsty, and willing to sacrifice another eighteen slaves if necessary.\n\"Might I suggest,\" Gorklith queried tremulously, \"Having the slaves practice moving about in the armor, here in the courtyard, before sending them to face the Nords?\"\nArslic Oan coolly allowed it, and for a few hours, the slaves wandered about the stronghold courtyard in their suits of bonemold. They grew used to the give of the joints, the rigidity of the backplate, the weight pushed onto their shoulders and hips. They discovered how to plant their feet slightly askew to keep their balance steady; how to quickly turn, pivoting without falling down; how to break into a run and stop quickly. By the time they were sent out of the castle gates, they were easily very nearly almost amateurs in the use of their &lt;a href=\"Medium%20Armor%20%28Morrowind%29\"&gt;medium weight armor&lt;/a&gt;.\nSeventeen of them were killed and eaten, but one made it back with a jar of water.\n\"It's perfect nonsense,\" said Xiomara. \"But my point is still valid even so. Like all great inventors, even in fiction, the armorer worked diligently to create the bonemold.\"\n\"I think there was a good deal of happenstance as well,\" frowned Garaz. \"But it is an appalling story. I wish you hadn't told me.\"\n\"If you think that's appalling,\" grinned Hallgerd. \"You should hear what happened next.\""}

One of them finally makes it back with some water.\"\nIt was only one jarful of water (said Hallgerd, pulling back in his chair and continuing the tale), and Arslic Oan drank most of it, passing the remains to his dear armorer Gorkith and the last dribbles to the few dozen slaves who still lived. It was hardly enough to sustain health and well-being. Another expedition was necessary, but they had only one suit of bonemold left, as there was only one survivor of the trip.\n\"One out of eighteen slaves made it through the gauntlet of Nords wearing that marvelous bonemold armor of yours,\" said Arslic Oan to Gorkith. \"And one can only carry back enough water for one. Therefore, mathematically, as we have, counting you and me, fifty-six remaining people at the stronghold, we need armor for fifty-four. Since we already have one, you only need to make fifty-three to make the total. That way, three will make it back, with enough water for you and me and whoever's in the best condition to partake. I don't know what we'll do after that, but if we wait, we won't have enough slaves to fetch even a couple days' worth of water.\"\n\"I understand,\" whimpered Gorkith. \"But how am I going to make the armor? I used all the livestock bones to make the first batch of bonemold.\"\nArslic Oan gave an order which Gorkith fearfully complied with. In eighteen hours -\n\"What do you mean 'Arslic Oan gave an order which Gorkith fearfully complied with'?\" asked Xiomara. \"What was the order?\"\n\"All will be clear,\" smiled Hallgerd. \"I have to choose what to reveal and what to conceal. Such is the way of the tale teller.\"\nIn eighteen hours, Gorkith had fifty-three suits of bonemail (said Hallgerd, continuing, not really minding the interruption) prepared for the slaves. Without prompting, he ordered the slaves to practice using the armor, and even allowed them more training time than their predecessors. They not only learned how to move and stop quickly in bonemold, but how to adjust their peripheral vision to see a blow before it came, and to sway to dodge, and where the sturdiest reinforcement points on the arm were -- the center of the chest and the abdomen -- and how to position themselves to take blows there, against their natural instincts. The slaves even had time for a mock battle before being sent out among the cannibals.\nThe slaves handled themselves admirably. Very few, just fifteen slaves, were killed and eaten out right. Only ten were killed and eaten when they reached the river. That was when things did not go according to Arslic Oan's plans. Twenty-one slaves with jars of water took off for the hills. Only eight returned to the castle, largely because they were blocked by the cannibal Nords. It was a larger percentage than he had anticipated surviving, but Arslic Oan felt righteous indignation at the paucity of loyalty.\n\"Are you absolutely certain you wouldn't rather flee?\" he hollered from the battlements.\nFinally, he allowed the survivors in. Three had been killed waiting for the gate to open. Two more died almost upon stepping into the courtyard. One was delirious, walking around in circles, laughing and dancing before suddenly collapsing. That meant five jars of water for four people, the two surviving slaves, Arslic Oan, and Gorkith. As the lord of the manor, Arslic Oan took the extra jar, but he was democratic with the others.\n\"You're quite correct,\" frowned Garaz. \"This story is getting more and more appalling.\"\n\"Just wait,\" smiled Hallgerd.\nThe next morning (Hallgerd continued) Arslic Oan awoke to a perfectly still and quiet stronghold. There was no murmuring in the corridors, no sound of hard labor in the courtyard. He dressed and surveyed the scene. It appeared that the fortress was utterly deserted. Arslic Oan walked down to the armorer's quarters, but the door was locked.\n\"Open up,\" said Arslic Oan, patiently. \"We need to speak. Thirty out of fifty-four slaves successfully made it to the river and gathered water. Admittedly, some then fled, and a couple didn't survive because I needed to correct their fickleness, but mathematically, that's a fifty-five percent survival rate. If you and I and the two remaining slaves made the next run to the river, we two should survive.\"\n\"Zilian and Gelo left last night with their armor,\" cried Gorklith through the door.\n\"Who are Zilian and Gelo?\"\n\"The two remaining slaves! They don't remain anymore!\"\n\"Well, that's vexing,\" said Arslic Oan. \"Still we must continue on. Mathematically--\"\n\"I heard something last night,\" whimpered Gorklith in a funny voice. \"Like footsteps, only different, and they were moving through the walls. And there were voices too. They sounded strange, like they couldn't move their jaws very well, but I knew one.\"\nArslic Oan sighed, humoring his poor armorer: \"And who was it?\"\n\"Ponik.\"\n\"And who is Ponik?\"\n\"One of the slaves that died when the Nords poisoned our water. One of the many, many slaves that died, and we made use of. He was always a nice, uncomplaining fellow, that's why I noticed his voice above all the others,\" Gorklith began to sob. \"I understood what he was saying.\"\n\"Which was what?\" asked Arslic Oan with a sigh.\n\"'Give me back my bones!'\" Gorklith's voice shrieked. There was silence for a moment, and then more hysterical sobbing.\n\"I saw that coming,\" laughed Xiomara.\nThere was nothing more to be done with the armorer for the time being (said Hallgerd, a trifle annoyed at the regular interruptions), so Arslic Oan stripped one of the dead slaves of his suit of bonemold and put it on. He practiced in the courtyard, impressing himself with his natural comfortably with &lt;a href=\"Medium%20Armor%20%28Morrowind%29\"&gt;medium weight armor&lt;/a&gt;. For hours, he boxed, feinted, dodged, sprinted, skipped, jumped, and generally cavorted about. When he felt tired, he retired to the shade and took a nap.\nThe sound of the king's trumpet woke him with a start. Night had fallen, and for a moment, he thought he had been dreaming. Then the alarm sounded again, far in the distance, but clear. Arslic Oan leapt to his feet and ran to the ramparts. Several miles away, he could see the emissaries and their vast and well-armed escort approach. They were there early! The cannibal Nords below looked at one another with consternation. Savages they might be, but they knew when a superior force was approaching.\nArslic Oan joyously dashed down the stairs to Gorklith's chamber. The door was still locked. He beat on it, cajoling, demanding, threatening. Finally, he found a key, one of the few scraps of metal that had not been smelted days before.\nGorklith appeared to be sleeping, but as Arslic Oan approached, he noticed that the armorer's mouth and eyes were wide open and his arms were folded unnaturally behind his back. On closer inspection, the armorer was obviously dead. What was more, his face and whole body were sunken, like an empty pig's bladder.\nSomething moved through the walls, like a footfall only... squishy. Arslic Oan expertly and gracefully turned to face it, completely in balance.\nAt first, it seemed like nothing more than a bubble expanding through one of the cracks in the stone. As more of the flesh-colored gelatinous matter emerged, it more clearly resembled part of a face. A flaccid, almost shapeless face with a low brow and a slack, toothless jaw. The rest of the body oozed out of the crack, a soft bag of muscle and blood. Behind Arslic Oan and to the side, there was more movement, more slaves welling up through the cracks in the stone. They were all around him, reaching out.\n\"Give us,\" moaned Ponik, his tongue rolling about his hanging jaw. \"Give us back our bones.\"\nArslic Oan began to rip off his bonemold, throwing it to the floor. A hundred figures, more, pooled into the small chamber.\n\"That's not enough.\"\nThe cannibals had cleared away by the time the king's emissaries arrived at Arslic Oan's gates. They had not been looking forward to this visit. It was best, they though philosophically, to begin with the worst of the king's noblemen, so to end their trip well. They sounded the alarm once again, but the gates did not open. There was no sound from Arslic Oan's stronghold.\nIt took a few hours to gain access.

Legend tells of a noble lord by the name of Arslic Oan. As a servant to the king, he was granted a castle and land for his service. Arslic built himself a walled stronghold and settled down with his slaves to enjoy a quiet life.\nSoon after, a tribe of cannibalistic &lt;a href=\"Nords\"&gt;Nords&lt;/a&gt; began attacking Arslic's slaves in the fields, and then slowly grew bolder, until they held the very stronghold itself under siege. After several failed attempts at sending his slaves to fetch water from a river, Arslic asked his armorer, Gorkith, to forge an armor sturdier than leather but lighter than metal. Bonemold armor was his answer and although seventeen of his slaves were killed and eaten in the subsequent attempt, one made it back with a jar of water.\nLocations.\nThis armor piece can only be found on the island of &lt;a href=\"Solstheim%20%28Dragonborn%29\"&gt;Solstheim&lt;/a&gt;.

We are happy to report that an actual vampire (who will remain anonymous) helped us clear up the distinction! Here are some signs that you're dealing with a vampire instead of a bloodfiend:1. A &lt;a href=\"Vampire%20%28Online%29\"&gt;vampire&lt;/a&gt; will usually attempt some form of conversation before he or she attacks you. A bloodfiend will simply go straight for your throat.2. Vampires may look under the weather, but they usually keep their condition hidden. A &lt;a href=\"bloodfiend\"&gt;bloodfiend&lt;/a&gt; is obviously stricken, with patchy hair, extremely pale skin, wrinkled features, and bloodshot eyes.3. Vampires will not feed on corpses. They liken it to us eating trash. Bloodfiends make no such distinction."}

Do not, however, return the boots to the &lt;a href=\"The%20Gray%20Fox%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;Gray Fox&lt;/a&gt;.\nUpon obtaining the boots, equip them to get a +50 Acrobatics bonus, then travel to the &lt;a href=\"Shrine%20of%20Sanguine\"&gt;Shrine of Sanguine&lt;/a&gt; and begin the Daedric quest there. Follow through that quest, and get arrested by Leyawiin guards. All possessions will be taken except for key items (which include the Boots).\nServe the sentence, and upon exiting, check the inventory. The &lt;a href=\"Hero%20of%20Kvatch\"&gt;Hero&lt;/a&gt; should still possess the boots, but when they try to equip them the notice \"You cannot equip this item at this time\" will appear. However, if the active &lt;a href=\"Enchanting%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;enchantments&lt;/a&gt; are checked, the +50 to Acrobatics will still be there. Other footwear can be worn, but the enchantment from the Boots of Springheel Jak will remain.\nThis is even simpler with a &lt;a href=\"Ring%20of%20Disrobing%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;Ring of Disrobing&lt;/a&gt; from the expansion. Put the boots on, exit and re-enter the journal and put on the ring, exit the menus and allow the ring to remove the boots (and anything else the Hero may be wearing), and the permanent +50 to Acrobatics should remain. In some cases, a somewhat less than the full 50+ increase will occur, but it is a significant permanent increase in acrobatics nonetheless."}

He knows that a descendant of Springheel Jak, &lt;a href=\"Jakben%2C%20Earl%20of%20Imbel\"&gt;Jakben, Earl of Imbel&lt;/a&gt;, lives in &lt;a href=\"Imperial%20City%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;Imperial City&lt;/a&gt;.\nWalkthrough.\nTravel to the Imperial City and question any of the &lt;a href=\"Beggars%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;beggars&lt;/a&gt; about Jakben and where his house can be found. They will direct the Hero to the main courtyard of the &lt;a href=\"Talos%20Plaza%20District\"&gt;Talos Plaza District&lt;/a&gt;, where &lt;a href=\"Jakben%20Imbel%27s%20House\"&gt;his house&lt;/a&gt; is located. Jakben stays inside of his home during the day, and leaves it only during the night, starting at 10pm. He has one servant, &lt;a href=\"Gemellus%20Axius\"&gt;Gemellus Axius&lt;/a&gt;.\nIn order to find more information, the Hero must reach Jakben's private quarters. Enter through the wooden door at the far end of the hall, then take the staircase leading up to the trap door to find his room. The &lt;a href=\"Lockpicking%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;hard locked&lt;/a&gt; door nearby leads to the servant's room, while the average locked door leads to a miscellaneous office. A book of the &lt;a href=\"Imbel%20genealogy\"&gt;Imbel genealogy&lt;/a&gt; can be found on his desk within his quarters.\nWhile this book does not provide any useful information regarding the location of the boots, a message will be prompted after reading the book that directs the Hero to ask Jakben himself about his ancestor and the boots. Upon seeing the Hero, he will be frightened, claiming he will do anything asked of him so long as he can remain unharmed. After questioning, he will inform the Hero that the boots are within the family crypts below the house. He will then give them a key that unlocks the basement, and remain cowering out of fear in his room.\nAfter entering the basement and the crypt, one will find five &lt;a href=\"Leveled%20Creatures%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;leveled&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Vampire%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;vampires&lt;/a&gt;. A &lt;a href=\"Vampire%20Patriarch\"&gt;vampire patriarch&lt;/a&gt; will be guarding the last room, located in the eastern area, that contains Springheel Jak's coffin. Upon searching this room, the Hero will come across the &lt;a href=\"Diary%20of%20Springheel%20Jak\"&gt;Diary of Springheel Jak&lt;/a&gt;.\nAfter reading the diary, it becomes apparent that Jakben is the Springheel Jack himself, having escaped death through the immortality of being a vampire. He will become hostile towards the Hero and attack them in the crypts. After killing Jakben, retrieve the Boots of Springheel Jak off of his corpse, and then return to the Gray Fox in Cheydinhal for the reward.\nAlternative strategy.\nInstead of going through the family crypts to find his diary, one may also simply kill Jakben. His armor and boots can then be looted from his corpse after. Note that attacking Jakben outright without reading his diary first will likely incur a bounty, unless no one witnesses the assault. A stealth attack in his attic is a good choice here. Witnessed or not, this will attract the attention of the &lt;a href=\"Dark%20Brotherhood%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;Dark Brotherhood&lt;/a&gt; if this is the Hero's first murder."}

This can serve to make hostile creatures less effective by mitigating their ability to deal damage as well as making them easier to destroy. If a creature affected by this ability only has 1 point of power initially, it will be unable to attack unless it is later given an item that increases its power.

At first, I didn't understand it. We were already making good coin sacking the carriages. What was the point of digging holes underground like vermin? It didn't help that the tunnel smelled like a troll's armpit.\nWe reached the warehouse, and walked by crates stacked upon crates like mountains of wood. M'Sharra led me to the back, where a dozen Legionnaires were unloading cargo too big for any box. And &lt;a href=\"Shor\"&gt;Shor&lt;/a&gt;'s Breath, I couldn't believe my eyes when I saw it! It was a skull the size of a carriage, with fangs that touched the floor! \nFor someone who winces at the sight of cliff racers, the idea of this monstrosity soaring through the sky made my heart tremble. And yet, for the first time, I felt alive.\nFor what better way to live than to fight a &lt;a href=\"Dragon%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;dragon&lt;/a&gt;! What better way to die! Now that would be a story even &lt;a href=\"Tsun\"&gt;Tsun&lt;/a&gt; would lend an ear to!\n\"You think the bones are special, you should see what this one found yesterday,\" M'Sharra said to me. Her grin was as wide as the Halls of &lt;a href=\"Jorrvaskr\"&gt;Jorrvaskr&lt;/a&gt; as she beckoned me further into the warehouse. Inside a crate, set apart from the others, was a cuirass of Dragonbone Mail! M'Sharra bade me to put it on, and I couldn't help but notice it was a perfect fit.\nIn that moment, I thought of my Da. People called him a pirate, a murderer and a thief. But he told me the Wind-Striders descended from the &lt;a href=\"Dragonguard\"&gt;Dragonguard&lt;/a&gt;, ancient warriors who fashioned armor from the bones of the dragons they slew. \nStill, my pride as a Nord wouldn't allow it. How could I face Tsun wearing the armor of another's triumph? I could have the Orc forge gauntlets and boots from the skull, but the cuirass - that which held one's heart, must be earned in battle. \nMy mind drifted then to stories I heard as a youngling, of my great ancestor who strode through fire like it was the wind, wearing an ancient cuirass made of dragonbone. It was then that I knew my destiny. In his honor I would claim it, and fight until the day I reached &lt;a href=\"Sovngarde%20%28Location%29\"&gt;Sovngarde&lt;/a&gt;. \nIt's that same spirit that resides in me now. The others may be fine living in hiding, but a Nord is at war so long as he holds breath."}

The Dragonborn will interact with several members consistently throughout a variety of quests within .\nBackground.\nThe Black-Briars have always been a powerful and affluent family in Riften, and have been in careful and ultimate jurisdiction over the city's cultural and ethical affairs, decisions, and industries with the purpose of controlling as much as they see fit to their own gain. Of all the members, Maven Black-Briar is the family matriarch who uses everything within her grasp to all of its possible efficiency and usefulness to further herself, her family and her successful business, &lt;a href=\"Black-Briar%20Meadery\"&gt;Black-Briar Meadery&lt;/a&gt;.

She cares for none, and has faith in just as many, believing in nothing but the rule of cause and effect. She uses this as her weapon, and will not hesitate to have anyone that stands in her way taught a lesson either by the Thieves Guild, or even the Dark Brotherhood.\nHemming Black-Briar.\nHemming Black-Briar has a pompous personality, obeying his mother's every wish and whim while proclaiming himself to be among the most skilled of both swordsmen and merchants alike. He has great ambition and wishes to bring Black-Briar Meadery to the whole of Tamriel one day.\nSibbi Black-Briar.\nSibbi Black-Briar is arguably the most infamous member of the family, bringing much dishonour and shame to the name of Black-Briar, and is known for using Maven's wealth for his dark indulgences. He is currently imprisoned within Mistveil Watch, in what some would call an extravagant cell, after killing the brother of his ex-fianc\u00e9e, &lt;a href=\"%20Lynly%20Star-Sung\"&gt;Svidi&lt;/a&gt;, and has also been known to frequent adultery.\nIngun Black-Briar.\nEccentric and rather morbid, she is the member who is least interested with the family business. She works with &lt;a href=\"Elgrim\"&gt;Elgrim&lt;/a&gt; at his shop, &lt;a href=\"Elgrim%27s%20Elixirs\"&gt;Elgrim's Elixirs&lt;/a&gt;, and hopes to be a skilled alchemist someday. She will talk to the Dragonborn about what exactly she finds so fascinating about alchemy, stating that she finds an excitement within seeing toxins shut down a person's body and that there is a beautiful irony in how the world around her provides the means for both life and death.\nMembers (Online).\n&lt;a href=\"Leidela%20Black-Briar\"&gt;Leidela Black-Briar&lt;/a&gt;.\nLeidela Black-Briar is an influential member of &lt;a href=\"Riften%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Riften&lt;/a&gt;'s society.

Eventually this resulted in him learning how to &lt;a href=\"Bend%20Will\"&gt;bend the will&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"Dragons%20%28Lore%29\"&gt;Dov&lt;/a&gt;. The &lt;a href=\"Dwemer\"&gt;Dwemer&lt;/a&gt; discovered another in the &lt;a href=\"First%20Era\"&gt;First Era&lt;/a&gt;. Since the acquisition and usage of hidden knowledge was somewhat a specialty of the Dwemer, they began to study it to reveal its secrets.\nReading.\nOpening a Black Book transports the reader into a region in the realm of Apocrypha. Once the region has been traversed, a book awaits on a pedestal. Reading the book grants a unique &lt;a href=\"Powers%20%28Dragonborn%29\"&gt;power&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"Powers%20%28Dragonborn%29%23Abilities\"&gt;ability&lt;/a&gt;. When a reader enters the realm of the Apocrypha by opening a Black Book, a spectral, transparent form of themselves remains anchored in Mundus, maintaining a connection to their life force.\nHowever, when opening a Black Book inside Apocrypha, the corresponding region of Apocrypha does not open. Instead the &lt;a href=\"Last%20Dragonborn\"&gt;Dragonborn&lt;/a&gt; is transported back to Solstheim. This can be used to exit Apocrypha at any time without using (reaching) the hidden knowledge book typically set at the end of each Apocrypha scenario. This is especially important in the case of reading \"\" without activating the final main quest \"&lt;a href=\"At%20the%20Summit%20of%20Apocrypha\"&gt;At the Summit of Apocrypha&lt;/a&gt;,\" because after reaching the &lt;a href=\"Word%20Walls%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Word Wall&lt;/a&gt; for &lt;a href=\"Dragon%20Aspect%20%28Dragonborn%29\"&gt;Dragon Aspect&lt;/a&gt;, there is no visible exit in the form of an interactive item while the door behind the Dragonborn is locked.\nBlack Books can only be read while in Solstheim. Attempting to read a Black Book in Skyrim will result in the message: \"A vision of Solstheim swims before your eyes and then is gone.\" When the message is acknowledged, the inventory closes and the surroundings shake briefly. Additionally, if used during an activity like wood chopping, &lt;a href=\"dragon%20riding\"&gt;dragon riding&lt;/a&gt;, or while sitting down, a message will appear saying: \"You are unable to concentrate on what you're reading.\" Trying to read a Black Book while doing one of these activities not on Solstheim will bring up the latter message.\nHidden Knowledge.\nThe area covered by each Black Book other than \"Waking Dreams\" ends with a fixed book (on a pedestal) containing three items of Hidden Knowledge. Each is represented by a green glowing sphere floating above the book. When activated, the corresponding power or active effect is granted. Only one from each area can be active at a time, but the Dragonborn can return at any time to activate a different effect. The edge of the book on the pedestal can be activated to return to Solstheim. Learning the secrets of five Black Books will award the &lt;a href=\"Achievements%20%28Dragonborn%29\"&gt;achievement&lt;/a&gt; \"Hidden Knowledge.\""}

Black Gate's exterior is unknown, but the interior of Black Gate has two floors, with waterways flowing through it, likely from the &lt;a href=\"Thir%20River\"&gt;Thir River&lt;/a&gt; nearby. Bridges hover over the water canals, connecting several areas in the fortress. The Second Level is more abundant with water.\nHistory.\n&lt;a href=\"First%20Era\"&gt;First Era&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe fortress of Black Gate was besieged by the &lt;a href=\"Second%20Empire\"&gt;Second Empire&lt;/a&gt; under the command of &lt;a href=\"Juilek%20Cyrodiil\"&gt;Juilek Cyrodiil&lt;/a&gt;, the heir to the &lt;a href=\"Ruby%20Throne\"&gt;Ruby Throne&lt;/a&gt;. Although technically, Juilek was not responsible for the assault, despite leading the helm for the invasion over Morrowind in the Four Score War. The command was brought about by &lt;a href=\"Reman%20Cyrodiil%20III\"&gt;Reman Cyrodiil III&lt;/a&gt;, the then Emperor of Cyrodiil. The Sacking of Black Gate was brought about after the Four Score War, when Juilek negotiated a deal with &lt;a href=\"Vivec\"&gt;Vivec&lt;/a&gt; of the &lt;a href=\"Tribunal\"&gt;Tribunal&lt;/a&gt;. When the prince met with Vivec at &lt;a href=\"Fervinthil\"&gt;Fervinthil&lt;/a&gt;, he agreed to return Black Gate to the province of Morrowind. Because of this unsuspected attack on Black Gate, the alliance between the two provinces would have withered, as &lt;a href=\"Sotha%20Sil\"&gt;Sotha Sil&lt;/a&gt; stated, it must be considered a break in a truce. Luckily, no conflict ensued afterward, but Juilek Cyrodiil would be assassinated at &lt;a href=\"Dorsza%20Pass\"&gt;Dorsza Pass&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Black%20Marsh\"&gt;Black Marsh&lt;/a&gt;, though it was not connected to the Tribunal. The treaty between the Empire and Morrowind was destroyed by Juilek's assassin.\n&lt;a href=\"Third%20Era\"&gt;Third Era&lt;/a&gt;.\nDuring the &lt;a href=\"Imperial%20Simulacrum\"&gt;Imperial Simulacrum&lt;/a&gt; from &lt;a href=\"3E%20389\"&gt;3E 389&lt;/a&gt; to &lt;a href=\"3E%20399\"&gt;3E 399&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Emperor\"&gt;Emperor&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Uriel%20Septim%20VII\"&gt;Uriel Septim VII&lt;/a&gt; was imprisoned along with &lt;a href=\"Talin%20Warhaft\"&gt;Talin Warhaft&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;a href=\"Deadlands\"&gt;Deadlands&lt;/a&gt; by &lt;a href=\"Jagar%20Tharn\"&gt;Jagar Tharn&lt;/a&gt;. Tharn planned for months to capture the throne, and he was able to achieve so in the span of ten years. Tharn had a powerful weapon called the &lt;a href=\"Staff%20of%20Chaos\"&gt;Staff of Chaos&lt;/a&gt;, and he split it into nine pieces and scattered them across &lt;a href=\"Tamriel\"&gt;Tamriel&lt;/a&gt;, the staff was the only thing keeping Uriel Septim and Warhaft in &lt;a href=\"Oblivion%20%28Realm%29\"&gt;Oblivion&lt;/a&gt;. A warrior escaped his clutches and traveled all corners of Tamriel to retrieve the missing pieces. The hero was known as the &lt;a href=\"Eternal%20Champion\"&gt;Eternal Champion&lt;/a&gt;, and he assembled the staff and defeated Jagar Tharn at the &lt;a href=\"Imperial%20Palace\"&gt;Imperial Palace&lt;/a&gt;.\nAfter obtaining the seventh piece of the Staff of Chaos, the last province to explore was the province of Morrowind, and so the Eternal Champion had traveled to the city-state of &lt;a href=\"Ebonheart\"&gt;Ebonheart&lt;/a&gt; and gained an audience with &lt;a href=\"King%20Casik\"&gt;King Casik&lt;/a&gt;. King Casik had come into possession of the &lt;a href=\"Anvil%20of%20Mithas\"&gt;Anvil of Mithas&lt;/a&gt;, an ancient &lt;a href=\"Dwarven\"&gt;Dwarven&lt;/a&gt; artifact that was able to craft the most refined weapons and armor in all of Tamriel. The only thing that will not be shattered by the Anvil was the &lt;a href=\"Hammer%20of%20Gharen\"&gt;Hammer of Gharen&lt;/a&gt;, another Dwarven artifact; it was said to be lost in the depths of Black Gate. If the Champion brought the Hammer to the King, they would reveal the location of the last piece, which was in &lt;a href=\"Red%20Mountain\"&gt;Dagoth Ur&lt;/a&gt;. And so the Champion traveled to the central plains and encountered the ruins of Black Gate, where they were able to find the Hammer of Gharen. The Champion would then set forth to Dagoth Ur and retrieve the final piece of the Staff of Chaos."}

The King proposes a deal to the Eternal Champion: if they recover the Hammer of Gharen from the depths of the dungeon known as &lt;a href=\"Black%20Gate%20%28Location%29\"&gt;Black Gate&lt;/a&gt;, he will reveal and mark the location of the volano's entrance on their map.\nAfter accepting the Casik's quest, the King mark the location of Black Gate on the map.\nBlack Gate.\nRecommended effects:\nBlack Gate is located southeast of Ebonheart. Inside of this bi-level dungeon the Eternal Champion may encounters a great variety of creatures: &lt;a href=\"Rat%20%28Arena%29\"&gt;Rats&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Stone%20Golem\"&gt;Stone Golem&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"Hell%20Hound\"&gt;Hell Hound&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"Homonculi\"&gt;Homonculi&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Ghost%20%28Arena%29\"&gt;Ghosts&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Ghoul\"&gt;Ghoul&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"Iron%20Golem\"&gt;Iron Golem&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"Fire%20Daemon\"&gt;Fire Daemon&lt;/a&gt;s, and, rarely, &lt;a href=\"Medusa%20%28Creature%29\"&gt;Medusas&lt;/a&gt;.\nFirst Level.\nThe First Level of the Black Gate is a zone of moderate size which is split by water channels. The door to the Second Level is located west of area's central position (\"as seen marked with a blue square on the map\"). It is possible to use the effect Levitation to fly above the water and reach a safe place near the door to the Second Level, avoiding many creatures and longer paths.\nIf a terrestrial path is taken, it should be noted that there is nothing unusual on the First Level of the Black Gate. There are mainly abysses on the south and lava on the northwest.\nThe entrance to the Second Level will provide a riddle to be opened.\n\"This door is sealed tight. A question is carved above it.\"\n\"What answer do you give?\"\n\"What is the thing\"\n\"which comes in sheets,\"\n\"yet cannot be folded or\"\n\"gathered again?\"\nThe answer is \"Rain.\"\nSecond Level.\nThe Second Level contains considerably more water than the First. The Hammer of Gharen remains south of the entrance, surrounded by unbreakable walls. This room can be accessed by through three locked entrances; each one has a correspondent key found in various parts of the Second Level. Fortunately, only one is necessary to open the room. These keys are the Ruby Key, the Sapphire Key, and the Emerald Key in this case. The map on the right marks the Ruby Key (on the northwest) with a red square, the Emerald Key (on the northeast) with a green square, and the Sapphire Key (on the southwest) with a light-blue square. Note, the Sapphire Key is on the inventory of an &lt;a href=\"Iron%20Golem\"&gt;Iron Golem&lt;/a&gt;, who must be defeated to obtain it.\nOnce one of the Keys has been found, the Eternal Champion must find the corresponding door and open it. A Fire Daemon and an Iron Golem will be protecting the Hammer of Gharen; after their defeat, the Eternal Champion can conquest the ancient weapon and exit the dungeon, preferably using Levitation again.\nEbonheart II.\nUpon being given the Hammer of Gharen, King Casik will fulfill his part of the deal and mark the entrance of Dagoth-Ur in the map."}

{"id": "1488", "revid": "5292016", "url": "https://elderscrolls.fandom.com/wiki?curid=1488", "title": "Black Marsh", "text": "Black Marsh, also known as Argonia, is one of the nine &lt;a href=\"provinces\"&gt;provinces&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"Tamriel\"&gt;Tamriel&lt;/a&gt;. It is the home of the &lt;a href=\"Argonians\"&gt;Argonians&lt;/a&gt;, the reptilian natives of this swampland rainforest. The province is filled with \"great inland waterways and impenetrable swamps.\" &lt;a href=\"Dunmer\"&gt;Dunmer&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"House%20Dres\"&gt;House Dres&lt;/a&gt; have long raided the province for slaves, until slavery was outlawed in &lt;a href=\"Morrowind\"&gt;Morrowind&lt;/a&gt; in the late &lt;a href=\"Third%20Era\"&gt;Third Era&lt;/a&gt;. Following the &lt;a href=\"Oblivion%20Crisis\"&gt;Oblivion Crisis&lt;/a&gt;, Black Marsh was one of the first provinces to successfully secede from the &lt;a href=\"Third%20Empire\"&gt;Empire&lt;/a&gt;.\n&lt;a href=\"Topal%20the%20Pilot\"&gt;Topal the Pilot&lt;/a&gt; is known to have referred to the land as the \"fetid, evil swamp lands and their human lizards.\" The name \"Argonia\" allegedly refers to an ancient battle that &lt;a href=\"Mer\"&gt;Mer&lt;/a&gt; fought there, although this is disputed.\nPeople.\nArgonians.\nThe Argonians are a race of reptilian people and the most famous of Black Marsh's natives. Argonians are one of the few races completely unrelated to men and mer, being descended directly from the &lt;a href=\"Hist\"&gt;Hist&lt;/a&gt;. \nEnigmatic and intelligent, the Argonians are experts of guerrilla tactics, and their natural abilities suit their swampy homeland. They have developed immunities to the diseases that have doomed many would-be explorers in the region, and they are capable of easily exploring underwater locations due to their ability to breathe underwater.\nA tall, black-scaled, puff adder-like sub-race of Argonian, the &lt;a href=\"Naga\"&gt;Naga&lt;/a&gt; are typically labeled violent thugs and drug smugglers, and they almost never leave Black Marsh, rarely coming into contact with non-Argonians.\nHist.\nThe Hist are thought to share a mind or have a hive mind ability. Though they share a mind, it is possible for one to \"go rogue\" and \"escape itself.\" In such instances, the Hist purge the rogue tree. This last happened to a tree in Lilmoth over 300 years ago. The current Lilmoth Hist grows from part of its root.\nThe Hist possesses hallucinogenic properties when used by non-&lt;a href=\"Argonian\"&gt;Argonian&lt;/a&gt; species, causing them to perceive civilians and actual enemies alike as hostile to them. Only Argonians may ingest the Hist sap to feel its full effects without negative reaction.The Hist also seem to have the ability to communicate telepathically with people who ingest their tree sap.\nLilmothiit.\nThe Limothiit are a mysterious, long-unseen &lt;a href=\"Beastfolk\"&gt;beast race&lt;/a&gt; that are thought to be extinct. Their fate is unknown, and the only information on them is stated in the &lt;a href=\"Pocket%20Guide%20to%20the%20Empire\"&gt;Pocket Guide to the Empire&lt;/a&gt;.\nLike the &lt;a href=\"Khajiit\"&gt;Khajiit&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Argonians\"&gt;Argonians&lt;/a&gt;, they are humanoid in form, and vulpine in appearance.\nGovernment.\nThere are several possibilities that could be the ruling body on Black Marsh. One of the possibilities is the &lt;a href=\"An-Xileel\"&gt;An-Xileel&lt;/a&gt; who seemed to be in charge of Black Marsh after the Oblivion Crisis. Possibly a political faction in Black Marsh that was part of the invasion of Morrowind.\nSince there are references to the Argonian King and an Argonian Royal Court, this might be the central governing body.\nAnother possibility is that the &lt;a href=\"Hist\"&gt;Hist&lt;/a&gt; are in control of the government in some way, or at least have an influence in it. Otherwise, its role is unknown.\nDuring the &lt;a href=\"Septim%20Dynasty\"&gt;Septim Dynasty&lt;/a&gt;, a socio-political position known as the &lt;a href=\"Archein\"&gt;Archein&lt;/a&gt; arose, consisting of native Argonians who had assimilated into &lt;a href=\"Imperial\"&gt;Imperial&lt;/a&gt; culture. They served as advisors and governors to more rural areas, some even owning slave-plantations.\nMilitary.\nThe &lt;a href=\"An-Xileel\"&gt;An-Xileel&lt;/a&gt; may be a military faction in Black Marsh.\nDuring the Second Era, two legions of phalanx units known as &lt;a href=\"Shellbacks\"&gt;Shellbacks&lt;/a&gt; assisted the &lt;a href=\"Nord\"&gt;Nord&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Dunmer\"&gt;Dunmer&lt;/a&gt; forces in turning the tide of the &lt;a href=\"Akaviri%20Invasions\"&gt;Akaviri Invasion&lt;/a&gt;. It is unknown if they continued to exist into the &lt;a href=\"Fourth%20Era\"&gt;Fourth Era&lt;/a&gt;.\n&lt;a href=\"Shadowscale\"&gt;Shadowscale&lt;/a&gt;s are Argonians, born under the sign of &lt;a href=\"The%20Shadow\"&gt;The Shadow&lt;/a&gt; in Black Marsh. They are trained from childhood in the art of stealth and combat. Shadowscales serve their country as assassins. They have historically been used by the King of Argonia as a means to end conflicts and wars without major bloodshed.\nThe city of &lt;a href=\"Lilmoth\"&gt;Lilmoth&lt;/a&gt; was known to employ a guard unit of non-Argonians called &lt;a href=\"Thtachalxan\"&gt;Thtachalxan&lt;/a&gt; or \"Drykillers\" in native &lt;a href=\"Jel\"&gt;Jel&lt;/a&gt;.\nWhile it was under &lt;a href=\"Imperial\"&gt;Imperial&lt;/a&gt; rule, Black Marsh was under the protection of the &lt;a href=\"Imperial%20Legion\"&gt;Imperial Legion&lt;/a&gt;. The Legion works for the Imperial government, with support from the &lt;a href=\"Emperor\"&gt;Emperor&lt;/a&gt;. In peacetime, the legionnaires serve as guards; in war, they have been used as an invasion force. In battle, the Imperial Legion is a feared and unstoppable force. Their huge numbers and strict discipline cause even the most battle-hardened army to question their tactics. With wide ranks of hundreds of disciplined soldiers, the Imperial Legion is a force not to be trifled with. However, the thick forests and dangerous swamps of the province typically stave off any invasion attempt. In addition, the Argonians natural adaptiveness to their homeland has caused many invasion attempts to fail.\nHistory.\n&lt;a href=\"First%20Era\"&gt;First Era&lt;/a&gt;.\nLittle is known about what occurred in Argonia, nor Argonians in general during much of the First Era, as the few Argonians that left the province were very rare and they themselves didn't talk about their history and preferred to integrate themselves into the larger Tamrielic cultures. The region and, by extension Argonians themselves, stayed independent of the Tamrielic Empire until the twenty-ninth century of the First Era.\nIt is known that there was a very successful enterprise of bandits and thieves that had long been exploiting the swampland of southeastern Tamriel, which was lead by most infamous of the brigadiers, \"Red\" &lt;a href=\"Red%20Bramman\"&gt;Bramman&lt;/a&gt;. The coastline along the east of Topal Bay had become notorious for acts of piracy because of these Bandits and thieves, and in 1E 1033, the Empress &lt;a href=\"Hestra\"&gt;Hestra&lt;/a&gt; demanded the head of Bramman.\nAfter many unsuccessful battles in the Bay, the &lt;a href=\"Imperial%20Navy\"&gt;Imperial Navy&lt;/a&gt; discovered the pirate-king's means of escaping capture; a narrow, winding river which emptied into the Bay near Soulrest, its mouth was screened by dense thickets of mangroves. The Imperial Fleet followed the course deeper into the heart of Black Marsh than any non-Argonian had ever been before. They eventually caught Bramman in his bandit kingdom not far from what is now called Blackrose, and took his head for the Empress.\nThe Argonians were defeated by the &lt;a href=\"Reman%20Empire\"&gt;Reman Empire&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"1E%202811\"&gt;1E 2811&lt;/a&gt; at the &lt;a href=\"Battle%20of%20Argonia\"&gt;Battle of Argonia&lt;/a&gt;. Following this defeat, the Argonians retreated to &lt;a href=\"Helstrom\"&gt;Helstrom&lt;/a&gt;, where the Imperials would not follow them. Slave traders exploited the Argonians, and \"entire tribes of Argonians were dragged in chains\" to the Dunmer land. Warlord dynasties were formed by former Imperial officers, who \"earned a reputation for tyranny even in those dark times.\"\nThe land that had once been a haven for Tamriel's criminals became its greatest prison state. Anyone considered too dangerous to hold in \"civilized\" dungeons in other Provinces was sent to Black Marsh.\n&lt;a href=\"Second%20Era\"&gt;Second Era&lt;/a&gt;.\nEven less is known about Argonian history in the Second Era. The only known recorded event occurred in &lt;a href=\"2E%20560\"&gt;2E 560&lt;/a&gt;, when the Argonians responded against their tyrannical oppressors with the &lt;a href=\"Knahaten%20Flu\"&gt;Knahaten Flu&lt;/a&gt;. Whether the terrible Knahaten Flu arose from natural causes, or was created by an Argonian shaman in retaliation for his people's oppression is still a matter of debate, but its result is clear. The plague began in &lt;a href=\"Stormhold\"&gt;Stormhold&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"2E%20560\"&gt;2E 560&lt;/a&gt;, and quickly spread to every corner of Black Marsh, killing all those not of reptilian stock. For over forty years, it held the Province in its grip, destroying entire cultures (notably, the &lt;a href=\"Kothringi\"&gt;Kothringi&lt;/a&gt;), and driving outsiders from the land.\nEven when the land became habitable again, fear of the disease kept most outsiders away. &lt;a href=\"House%20Dres\"&gt;House Dres&lt;/a&gt; of Morrowind continued to send slavers into the north, but few others saw any reason to trouble themselves with the land. Even &lt;a href=\"Tiber%20Septim\"&gt;Tiber Septim&lt;/a&gt;, it was said, thought twice before conquering Black Marsh for his new Empire. The borders of the province fell easily to his forces, but he wisely decided to avoid strategically unimportant inner swamps, and thus met with little resistance.\n&lt;a href=\"Third%20Era\"&gt;Third Era&lt;/a&gt;.\nBy the Third Era most of Argonia had been assimilated into the Empire with the exception of Helstrom. Helstrom is in the center of &lt;a href=\"Murkwood\"&gt;Murkwood&lt;/a&gt;, an area of marsh in the center of Argonia where it is almost impossible for non-Argonians to travel, so is the center of non-Imperial Black Marsh. This is also where the &lt;a href=\"Arnesian%20War\"&gt;Arnesian War&lt;/a&gt; uprising (which took place during the &lt;a href=\"Imperial%20Simulacrum\"&gt;Imperial Simulacrum&lt;/a&gt;), saw the Argonians exact revenge for the slavery that they suffered from &lt;a href=\"House%20Dres\"&gt;House Dres&lt;/a&gt;.\nIn approximately 3E 200th year, during the reign of &lt;a href=\"Katariah\"&gt;Katariah&lt;/a&gt;, there was a massacre at the village of &lt;a href=\"Armanias\"&gt;Armanias&lt;/a&gt;, due to a lack of sufficient armor.\nIn the &lt;a href=\"3E%20398\"&gt;398th year&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Decumus%20Scotti\"&gt;Decumus Scotti&lt;/a&gt; was a senior clerk at Lord Vanech's Building Commission. He was tasked with improving trade in the region of Black Marsh.\n&lt;a href=\"Oblivion%20Crisis\"&gt;Oblivion Crisis&lt;/a&gt;.\nIn the &lt;a href=\"Oblivion%20Crisis\"&gt;Oblivion Crisis&lt;/a&gt; the Argonians were ready for the &lt;a href=\"Daedra\"&gt;Daedra&lt;/a&gt; invaders thanks to the Hist. The An-Xileel led them and they successfully drove back the Daedra, following them back into the &lt;a href=\"Oblivion%20Gate\"&gt;Oblivion Gate&lt;/a&gt;s. Afterwards, Argonia seceded from the &lt;a href=\"Mede%20Dynasty\"&gt;Empire&lt;/a&gt;, making Black Marsh into an independent province.\n&lt;a href=\"Fourth%20Era\"&gt;Fourth Era&lt;/a&gt;.\nIn the aftermath of the &lt;a href=\"Red%20Year\"&gt;Red Year&lt;/a&gt; (&lt;a href=\"4E%205\"&gt;4E 5&lt;/a&gt;) the Argonians, now led by the An-Xileel, invaded Morrowind and conquered parts of the province's southern region in an event known as the &lt;a href=\"Accession%20War\"&gt;Accession War&lt;/a&gt;. They were only driven back by House Redoran after devastating much of the south including the former capital of Morrowind, &lt;a href=\"Mournhold\"&gt;Mournhold&lt;/a&gt;. They appear to be neutral to the ongoing hostilities between the Empire and the &lt;a href=\"Aldmeri%20Dominion%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Aldmeri Dominion&lt;/a&gt;.\nGeography.\nThe name \"Black Marsh\" was given to the portion of Argonia that was conquered by the &lt;a href=\"Second%20Empire\"&gt;Second Empire&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;a href=\"First%20Era\"&gt;First Era&lt;/a&gt;, even though Argonia had included the southern lands of Morrowind. Like &lt;a href=\"Morrowind\"&gt;Morrowind&lt;/a&gt;, it was \"never successfully invaded, but instead, peacefully incorporated.\" The majority of this province is a swampy marshland, with the southern half resembling a network of small islands, broken up by intersecting rivers. Little is known about the actual size of Argonia, except that Lilmoth is located fifteen miles from the &lt;a href=\"Topal%20Bay\"&gt;Topal Bay&lt;/a&gt;. The province of Black Marsh encompasses the south-easternmost lands of the continent.\nBlack Marsh is also subjected to a unique type of rain that is sometimes referred to by the region's inhabitants as \"Hist Piss.\" Often accompanied by heavy thunder and fog, it has been described as \"an inferno of foul-smelling, yellow-brown rain.\"\nMajor cities of Black Marsh.\n&lt;a href=\"Archon\"&gt;Archon&lt;/a&gt;.\nA city located in the south east of Black Marsh. In 4E 187, the &lt;a href=\"Listener\"&gt;Listener&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Alisanne%20Dupre\"&gt;Alisanne Dupre&lt;/a&gt; mentioned to &lt;a href=\"Rasha%20%28Lore%29\"&gt;Rasha&lt;/a&gt;, a &lt;a href=\"Speaker\"&gt;Speaker&lt;/a&gt;, about reinstating training for &lt;a href=\"Shadowscale\"&gt;Shadowscale&lt;/a&gt;s in Archon. The proposal was dismissed due to a lack of resources.\n&lt;a href=\"Blackrose\"&gt;Blackrose&lt;/a&gt;.\nA major Argonian city located in the southern reaches of Black Marsh. Notably &lt;a href=\"Nienolas%20Ulwarth\"&gt;Nienolas Ulwarth&lt;/a&gt;, known as \"the mighty,\" hailed from this city. Murkwood is near this city, which is a forest the Eternal Champion visits to get a part of the Staff of Chaos.\n&lt;a href=\"Gideon\"&gt;Gideon&lt;/a&gt;.\nA major city in Argonia, this city was first founded by the Ayleids, and is in the westernmost section of Argonia, close to the border of &lt;a href=\"Cyrodiil\"&gt;Cyrodiil&lt;/a&gt;.\n&lt;a href=\"Helstrom\"&gt;Helstrom&lt;/a&gt;.\nThis city is in the center of Argonia. The city has never been reached by the Cyrodilic Empire and therefore is the capital of non-Imperial Black Marsh.\n&lt;a href=\"Lilmoth\"&gt;Lilmoth&lt;/a&gt;.\nLilmoth is the most southern city in Black Marsh and has been described as the \"festering jewel\" of &lt;a href=\"Black%20Marsh\"&gt;Black Marsh&lt;/a&gt;.\n&lt;a href=\"Soulrest\"&gt;Soulrest&lt;/a&gt;.\nSoulrest is a large city located in the south of Black Marsh where many go for their burial.\n&lt;a href=\"Stormhold\"&gt;Stormhold&lt;/a&gt;.\nOne of the major cities in Argonia. It was originally founded by the &lt;a href=\"Ayleid\"&gt;Ayleid&lt;/a&gt;s, and it is located in the northern part of Argonia.\n&lt;a href=\"Thorn\"&gt;Thorn&lt;/a&gt;.\nThorn is a city in Black Marsh close to the Border of &lt;a href=\"Morrowind\"&gt;Morrowind&lt;/a&gt;. It is the most north-easterly city in Black Marsh.\nEconomy.\nBlack Marsh continues to be a \"backward\" land economically by Imperial standards. Most of the agriculture is grown by subsistence farmers, though recently more has been shipped abroad.\nThe trade however is not very successful as the produce normally arrives to the &lt;a href=\"Cyrodiil\"&gt;Cyrodiil&lt;/a&gt; markets rotten, for it takes a tremendously long time for the goods to get to the market. Enormous investments attempting to improve the trade routes of Black Marsh have yielded very little success. Lord Xellicles Pinos-Revina, a wealthy trader, was the first to invest. At that time, it took three weeks for the rice and root he was importing to arrive, half-rotten, in the Imperial Province. Now, decades later and despite millions of gold invested, the time to get to market has increased. It now takes two and a half months for goods, now thoroughly rotten, to arrive.\nReligion.\nLittle information is known about the Argonian religion. However, some knowledge about these unique beliefs is known to non-Argonians. The most important thing to understand about their religion is the close bond between the odd &lt;a href=\"Hist\"&gt;Hist&lt;/a&gt; tree and the Argonians. The Hist is a unique type of tree that grows all around Black Marsh and is looked highly upon by the inhabitants. This tree, according to the Argonians, is intelligent and fully conscious. It produces a special sap that gives Argonians visions and enlightenment to their souls. In fact, Argonian hatchlings drink the sap of the Hist at birth and infancy. According to them, the sap of the hist tree, when drunk, gives a hatchling its soul. When that Argonian dies, his soul travels back to its Hist tree and is stored until another hatchling drinks that hist. Thus, the Hist is giving it a soul, and so the cycle repeats. The Hist tree can telepathically talk to the Argonian that has drunk the sap.\nIt also should be noted that the Hist and Argonians acknowledge &lt;a href=\"Sithis\"&gt;Sithis&lt;/a&gt; as their master. Along with worship of the Hist, the Argonians believe that Sithis is the original, the creator, and the father. The Hist, in their eyes, is much like the &lt;a href=\"Night%20Mother\"&gt;Night Mother&lt;/a&gt; is to the &lt;a href=\"Dark%20Brotherhood\"&gt;Dark Brotherhood&lt;/a&gt;. To show respect and full loyalty to Sithis, since they worship the Hist as their god, every Argonian born under the sign of &lt;a href=\"The%20Shadow\"&gt;The Shadow&lt;/a&gt; is given to the Dark Brotherhood at birth and trained under the art of stealth and assassination. Therefore, one day, that Argonian can earn the rank of &lt;a href=\"Shadowscale\"&gt;Shadowscale&lt;/a&gt; who serve Argonia as spies and assassins.\nCulture.\nVery little is known about the Argonian culture as of the Fourth Era. The difficult terrain within the Black Marsh, coupled with the apparent isolationist policies of the Argonians, renders this largely a mystery. It is known that great emphasis is placed upon the &lt;a href=\"Hist\"&gt;Hist&lt;/a&gt;, the strange trees that are abundant in the Marsh. Even what little is known about the Hist is the subject of much rumor and speculation. It is believed that the Argonians are somehow co-dependent upon the trees, and that the Hist forms some sort of hive-mind.\n&lt;a href=\"Marital\"&gt;Marital&lt;/a&gt; customs among the Argonians is one of the few widely-known aspects of Argonian life. Unlike the citizens of &lt;a href=\"Skyrim\"&gt;Skyrim&lt;/a&gt; who prefer to marry using an &lt;a href=\"Amulet%20of%20Mara\"&gt;Amulet of Mara&lt;/a&gt;, some Argonians adhere to their native marriage traditions. In &lt;a href=\"Black%20Marsh\"&gt;Black Marsh&lt;/a&gt;, it is customary to present a lover with an Argonian wedding band, which is crafted by the courting member. Each ring is unique and has personal meaning to the creator and the recipient. The actual ceremony of marriage is very long and complex, and involves unique rituals, spoken in the native language of the Argonians.\nArgonian culture in Black Marsh is not fully understood. Some evidence suggests that, like the Khajiit, the Argonian lifestyle is tribal. However, considering references to the Royal court of Argonia and the existence of the Shadowscales, the presence of some form of organized Argonian government is indeed possible. In the &lt;a href=\"Merethic%20Era\"&gt;Merethic Era&lt;/a&gt;, Argonians built stone stepped pyramids called Xanmeers. The artistic carvings adorned on the ancient &lt;a href=\"xanmeer\"&gt;xanmeer&lt;/a&gt;s depict reptilian heads, stylized with right angles. Many present-day Argonian settlements are built on the site of Xanmeers, utilizing the structures as palaces and plazas.\nDemographics.\nIn addition to the reptilian Argonians, who are today Black Marsh's most visible denizen, there were once tribes of men, the &lt;a href=\"Kothringi\"&gt;Kothringi&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Orma\"&gt;Orma&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Yespest\"&gt;Yespest&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Horwalli\"&gt;Horwalli&lt;/a&gt;\u2014and tribes of mer\u2014the &lt;a href=\"Barsaebic%20Ayleid\"&gt;Barsaebic Ayleid&lt;/a&gt;s and the &lt;a href=\"Cantemiric%20Velothi\"&gt;Cantemiric Velothi&lt;/a&gt;\u2014and even a tribe who may have been related to the Khajiit of Elsweyr, the vulpine &lt;a href=\"Lilmothiit\"&gt;Lilmothiit&lt;/a&gt;, living in Black Marsh.

More specifically, it hides behind some rocks against the southeast wall, near the south corner of the large room. Once it is turned, a rock surfaces, preventing you from leaving the same way you entered. The newly revealed exit leads back to the first level of the cave.\nUpon re-entering, there will be two new enemies patrolling the area. They are &lt;a href=\"Pirate%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;Black Rock Pirates&lt;/a&gt;; one is a &lt;a href=\"marksman%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;marksman&lt;/a&gt; and the other a &lt;a href=\"melee\"&gt;melee&lt;/a&gt; fighter, and both &lt;a href=\"Ghost%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;ghosts&lt;/a&gt; are a level above the &lt;a href=\"Hero%20of%20Kvatch\"&gt;Hero&lt;/a&gt;. Once they are dispatched, a quick scan of the area will reveal that another large rock has disappeared. In its place is the second switch. Activating the switch will yield the standard noise, however it seems that nothing has happened.\nBy entering the second level once again, there is an obvious difference. Yet another large rock has disappeared, and a trap door lies in its place. This trap door leads to the Lost Black Rock Chasm. Upon immediately entering, there is a path littered with &lt;a href=\"Skeleton%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;Skeleton&lt;/a&gt; remains, as well as dead &lt;a href=\"Bandits%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;bandits&lt;/a&gt;. Another large rock blocks the trail, however a switch on the right side wall will remove it. Just on the other side lies a &lt;a href=\"Shipwrecks\"&gt;ruined pirate ship&lt;/a&gt;.\nThere are four more Black Rock Pirates in this main area:\nWhen they have been defeated, the rest of the area can be safely explored."}

All black souls are of the grand level. The main benefit of a black soul gem is that it can capture grand leveled souls from humanoids, whereas those souls cannot normally be captured. These sources tend to be plentiful and easier to kill, compared with common grand level white soul sources, such as mammoths. Black soul gems can also absorb souls that are smaller than grand. &lt;a href=\"Nelacar%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Nelacar&lt;/a&gt; can transform the &lt;a href=\"Azura%27s%20Star%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;star&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"Daedric%20Prince\"&gt;Daedric Prince&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Azura\"&gt;Azura&lt;/a&gt; into a black soul gem with unlimited uses.

However, unlike standard soul gems, they can encapsulate the souls of humanoids. There are many methods by which souls are trapped in black soul gems, the most conventional being the &lt;a href=\"Soul%20Trap%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Soul Trap&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Conjuration%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Conjuration spell&lt;/a&gt;. The perk \"&lt;a href=\"Soul%20Stealer\"&gt;Soul Stealer&lt;/a&gt;\" allows &lt;a href=\"Bound%20Weapons%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;bound weapons&lt;/a&gt; to soul trap targets, and an &lt;a href=\"Soul%20Trap%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;enchantment&lt;/a&gt; serving the same function can be added to &lt;a href=\"Weapons%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;ordinary weapons&lt;/a&gt;. Black soul gems can also be used to create items at the &lt;a href=\"Atronach%20Forge\"&gt;Atronach Forge&lt;/a&gt;.\nEthics.\nThe souls of humanoids trapped in these soul gems remain conscious. They are generally regarded as unethical, and their use is prohibited at the &lt;a href=\"College%20of%20Winterhold%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;College of Winterhold&lt;/a&gt;, despite the institution's lenient stance on the practice of &lt;a href=\"Necromancy\"&gt;Necromancy&lt;/a&gt;. Soul Trapping humanoids is considered a &lt;a href=\"Crime%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;crime&lt;/a&gt; in many of &lt;a href=\"Skyrim\"&gt;Skyrim&lt;/a&gt;'s &lt;a href=\"Holds\"&gt;Holds&lt;/a&gt;.\nQuests.\n&lt;a href=\"Rising%20at%20Dawn\"&gt;Rising at Dawn&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Last%20Dragonborn\"&gt;Dragonborn&lt;/a&gt; must bring a filled black soul gem to &lt;a href=\"Falion%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Falion&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Morthal%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Morthal&lt;/a&gt; if they wish to cure themselves of &lt;a href=\"Vampirism%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;vampirism&lt;/a&gt;.\nLocations.\nBlack soul gems in are much more common than they were in ."}

Friend, maybe you could talk to the spirit? They seem \u2026 confused.\"\nAfter talking to Frii:\nDruid Laurel: \"Frii, I'm a druid. I'll take you someplace safe after I talk to my friend.\"\nFrii: \"Like the Druid King? Sunlight on leaves. Yes, Frii will go with you.\"\nWhen returning to the Glenmoril Wyrd Camp:\nDhulef: \"We could bring Frii to the Mages Guild. I'm sure they'd be safe there, Laurel.\"\nDruid Laurel: \"No, Dhulef.

{"id": "7152", "revid": "17401442", "url": "https://elderscrolls.fandom.com/wiki?curid=7152", "title": "Dual Wielding", "text": "Dual Wielding is a gameplay mechanic in that allows to wield a &lt;a href=\"One-Handed%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;one-handed&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Weapons%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;weapon&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Spells%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;spell&lt;/a&gt;, or &lt;a href=\"Staves%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;staff&lt;/a&gt; in each hand. While dual wielding, the equipped items do not have to match.\nEffects.\nDual wielding weapons.\nWhen dual wielding weapons, the &lt;a href=\"Last%20Dragonborn\"&gt;Dragonborn&lt;/a&gt; has four options of attack: attacking either with left or right weapon, attacking with both weapons simultaneously (by pressing both attack buttons at the same time) and performing a dual wielding power attack. All four attack types are affected by the Dual Flurry perk.\nAttacking with both weapons simultaneously does not consume stamina and as such is an easy and effective way of increasing the damage output. The damage, reach, stagger and any enchantments are calculated separately for each weapon. The speed of the attack is based on (but not equal to) weapon speed held in the left hand, so it is advisable to always hold the faster weapon in the left hand. Note that you cannot move when performing the dual attack.\nDual wielding power attacks do 50% extra damage and the stamina cost is half of what is needed for a regular power attack. The dual wielding power attack hits three times however, for a total of 150% extra damage and 150% stamina cost. The stamina used for dual wielding power attack is based on the weight of the weapon in the right hand only.\nDual wielding daggers results in a special power attack animation in which the Dragonborn first flips the dagger held in the right hand before performing the actual attack. While visually appealing, the time it takes to flip the dagger on every power attack decreases overall damage output. This is especially noticeable when attack speed is improved, either by the &lt;a href=\"Dual%20Flurry\"&gt;Dual Flurry&lt;/a&gt; perk or by the &lt;a href=\"Elemental%20Fury\"&gt;Elemental Fury&lt;/a&gt; shout.\nDual wielding spells or staves.\nDual wielding different spells works just as if the spells were cast in any other way. You can cast any combination of spells that require only one hand to cast.\nDual wielding the same spell can be improved if the Dual Casting perk of the appropriate school is unlocked. Dual casting a spell works just like dual attacking weapons - by pressing both left and right hand attack buttons simultaneously. The effect of dual cast depends on school - destruction spells deal more damage, conjuration spells last longer, restoration spells heal more, illusion spells work on higher level creatures and people, and so on. It also has a unique cast animation. Staves cannot be used for dual casting.\nIt should be noted that dual casting is only marginally more effective than casting independently with both hands(10% better spell effect) while at the same time being noticeably more magicka-intensive (40% higher magicka cost than when cast independently with both hands). As such, it should probably be avoided until enough magicka reserves(or casting cost reducing gear) is obtained, with the possible exception of Destruction Dual Casting, which is required to use the &lt;a href=\"Impact\"&gt;Impact&lt;/a&gt; perk.\nCharacter dual wielding.\nOther characters can dual wield, but the conditions under which they will do so are very particular. Some, such as &lt;a href=\"Jenassa\"&gt;Jenassa&lt;/a&gt;, will dual wield any two weapons when in range of an enemy. Most others will only equip certain weapons in their left hand, specifically a &lt;a href=\"Pickaxe%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;pickaxe&lt;/a&gt;, or &lt;a href=\"Forsworn%20Sword%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Forsworn sword&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"Forsworn%20Axe\"&gt;axe&lt;/a&gt;."}

But that isn't all. While we were talking, the Baroness came into the mill and hid something up on the second floor. I don't think she saw us, but we should be more careful from now on.\nThe Baron came to me today and asked what my intentions were toward Arlie. She told her mother about me, and is quite distraught. I told him how I feel and that I would never do anything to hurt her. I even offered to leave! He told me that wouldn't be necessary. I think he understands.\nReceived a shipment from &lt;a href=\"Shornhelm%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Shornhelm&lt;/a&gt;. Unusual stuff. Lots of powders, dried plants, and some kind of shimmery gemstones.

During the history\u00a0&lt;a href=\"First%20Council\"&gt;First Council&lt;/a&gt;, it is noted that the &lt;a href=\"Rourken%20Clan\"&gt;Rourken Clan&lt;/a&gt; refused to join him.\nThe combined armies of the Chimer and Dwemer were successful in stopping the Nordic Invasion. He and Nerevar were known to have been in attendance of the coronation of Emperor &lt;a href=\"Gorieus\"&gt;Gorieus&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"Cyrodiil\"&gt;Cyrodiil&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"1E%20461\"&gt;1E 461&lt;/a&gt;, diplomatically representing Resdayn in relative peace.\nUnbeknownst to him, one of his chief council members, &lt;a href=\"Kagrenac\"&gt;Kagrenac&lt;/a&gt;, was working in secret to create a new Dwemer God. &lt;a href=\"Dagoth%20Ur%20%28Character%29\"&gt;Voryn Dagoth&lt;/a&gt; discovered this, informing Nerevar, who then went to ask Dumac if the statement was true. Kagrenac took great offense, asking Nerevar who he was to question their affairs, and Dumac claimed his people were innocent of any wrongdoings. Nerevar later went to Vvardenfell one last time to negotiate with the Dwemer, quarreling bitterly with Dumac, who was still oblivious to Kagrenac's plans. The First Council broke down, and the &lt;a href=\"War%20of%20the%20First%20Council\"&gt;War of the First Council&lt;/a&gt; began.\nDuring the resulting &lt;a href=\"Battle%20of%20Red%20Mountain\"&gt;Battle of Red Mountain&lt;/a&gt;, Dumac led the Dwarven forces out of their strongholds, having automatons and atronachs at his command. Nerevar drew Dumac's armies into the fields, where they were defeated by his generals, while he travelled to the Heart Chamber. Nerevar killed Dumac with the Ethos Knife, and they both collapsed from the wounds and draining magics.\nAnother account state that Dumac and Nerevar weren't at odds during the Battle of Red Mountain and that they joined forces to stop &lt;a href=\"Wulfharth\"&gt;Wulfharth&lt;/a&gt; from using the power of the &lt;a href=\"Heart%20of%20Lorkhan\"&gt;Heart of Lorkhan&lt;/a&gt;. According to this version of the battle, King &lt;a href=\"Wulfharth\"&gt;Wulfharth&lt;/a&gt; was resurrected as &lt;a href=\"Shor\"&gt;Shor&lt;/a&gt;'s avatar and amassed an army comprising of &lt;a href=\"Nords\"&gt;Nords&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"orc\"&gt;orc&lt;/a&gt;s, and &lt;a href=\"House%20Dagoth\"&gt;House Dagoth&lt;/a&gt; to obtain the Heart of Lorkhan, which to the Nords was considered the Heart of Shor. In the climactic battle at the Battle of Red Mountain, Wulfharth had obtained the Heart but needed time to acclimate to its power. During this time, he and Voryn Dagoth faced Nerevar and his two companions, &lt;a href=\"Alandro%20Sul\"&gt;Alandro Sul&lt;/a&gt; and Dumac Dwarfking. Wulfharth blinded Alandro Sul with a shout and slew Dumac, but was weakened by a blow from Dumac's warhammer, &lt;a href=\"Sunder\"&gt;Sunder&lt;/a&gt;. Sunder had made the Heart solid and enabled Neravar to slay Wulfharth with a surprise side attack with &lt;a href=\"Keening\"&gt;Keening&lt;/a&gt; and cut out Wulfharth's heart."}

Dune is a merchant's metropolis amidst the war-torn grasslands of the March, also known for their tea parlors.\nDescription.\nGeography.\nThe city-state of Dune is situated within the provincial border region of Reaper's March, specifically, in the region of &lt;a href=\"Dawnmead\"&gt;Dawnmead&lt;/a&gt;. Reaper's March and the twin provinces are divided by the &lt;a href=\"Crescent%20River\"&gt;Crescent River&lt;/a&gt;, which starts at the end of the &lt;a href=\"Strid%20River\"&gt;Strid River&lt;/a&gt;. Dune is on the eastern side, towards the border into &lt;a href=\"Cyrodiil\"&gt;Cyrodiil&lt;/a&gt;. Among the land that Dune sits in, there are several settlements with the most notable one being &lt;a href=\"Fort%20Sphinxmoth\"&gt;Fort Sphinxmoth&lt;/a&gt;, the regional bulwark of Reaper's March. The townships of &lt;a href=\"S%27ren-ja\"&gt;S'ren-ja&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Pa%27alat\"&gt;Pa'alat&lt;/a&gt; are found beyond the city limits. The &lt;a href=\"Thizzrini%20Arena\"&gt;Thizzrini Arena&lt;/a&gt; is also found here. Northward are a series of ruins, such as the stronghold mentioned above of Sphinxmoth Legion Fort, and the Ayleid ruins of &lt;a href=\"Fardir%27s%20Folly\"&gt;Fardir's Folly&lt;/a&gt;. The gate into Cyrodiil found north of Dune leads into the &lt;a href=\"West%20Weald\"&gt;West Weald&lt;/a&gt; wilderness, near the &lt;a href=\"Priory%20of%20the%20Nine%20%28Location%29\"&gt;Priory of the Nine&lt;/a&gt;.\nDune itself is the largest settlement in all of Reaper's March, being an impenetrable wall built atop a plateau overlooking the region. Dune is split into four separate districts, each used differently. The Market District is the center of Dune, being built around a town square that is made as the central marketplace, bein referred to as, &lt;a href=\"The%20Stalls%20%28Dune%29\"&gt;the Stalls&lt;/a&gt;. The Northern District contains the local inn, the &lt;a href=\"Walker%27s%20Stay\"&gt;Walker's Stay&lt;/a&gt;, as well as, a Crafting Alley and local chapters of guilds (i.e., the &lt;a href=\"Fighters%20Guild\"&gt;Fighters Guild&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Mages%20Guild\"&gt;Mages Guild&lt;/a&gt;). To the south lies one of the two temple districts, with this one containing monasteries dedicated to &lt;a href=\"Jone\"&gt;Jone&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Jode\"&gt;Jode&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Lorkhaj\"&gt;Lorkhaj&lt;/a&gt;. Disciples often wander around the gardens and meditate. Finally in the center contains the &lt;a href=\"Temple%20of%20Two-Moons%20Dance%20%28Dune%29\"&gt;Temple of Two-Moons Dance&lt;/a&gt;, which is one of two in Reaper's March. This is the largest temple in Reaper's March. Inbetween these districts are alleys containing more merchants.\nHistory.\n&lt;a href=\"First%20Era\"&gt;First Era&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe Looter's Paradise &amp; the Dakarn Cats.\nIn the late First Era, around the &lt;a href=\"Second%20Empire\"&gt;Second Empire&lt;/a&gt;, the Border Scouts at &lt;a href=\"Fort%20Sphinxmoth\"&gt;Fort Sphinxmoth&lt;/a&gt; defended the area from the constant bandits and raiders. But at one point, the Scouts disappeared, leaving the region open for slaughter between rival clans, with the biggest conflict coming between the &lt;a href=\"Vinedusk%20Rangers\"&gt;Vinedusk Tribes&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Dakarn\"&gt;Dakarn Clan&lt;/a&gt;. Passing merchants were slaughtered and raided, and control over Sphinxmoth Legion Fort was shifting between the two factions, inadvertently, a \"\"Looter's Paradise\".\" The situation between the Vinedusk and the Dakarn had grown into high crime as the Dakarn Clan established a criminal empire from both Dune and the &lt;a href=\"Thizzrini%20Arena\"&gt;Thizzrini Arena&lt;/a&gt;. But when these groups reformed, like the Dakarn became the &lt;a href=\"Duneguard%20Outwalkers\"&gt;Duneguard Outwalkers&lt;/a&gt;, bloodshed in Reaper's March dwindled significantly, and Fort Sphinxmoth was ultimately abandoned.\n&lt;a href=\"Second%20Era\"&gt;Second Era&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe First Battle of Dune; the Planemeld.\nDuring the &lt;a href=\"Planemeld\"&gt;Planemeld&lt;/a&gt; on the 2nd of &lt;a href=\"Sun%27s%20Height\"&gt;Sun's Height&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"2E%20581\"&gt;2E 581&lt;/a&gt;, the city-state of Dune was attacked by the &lt;a href=\"Daedra\"&gt;Daedra&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"Coldharbour\"&gt;Coldharbour&lt;/a&gt;, via a &lt;a href=\"Dark%20Anchor\"&gt;Dark Anchor&lt;/a&gt; found on the outskirts, in an undisclosed &lt;a href=\"Dawnmead%20Dolmen\"&gt;village&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href=\"Dro-m%27Athra\"&gt;Dro-m'Athra&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Daedric%20Titan\"&gt;Daedric Titan&lt;/a&gt;s invaded Dune, burning through the defense against the Daedra. Dune would have been lost had a rag-tag group of &lt;a href=\"Fighters%20Guild\"&gt;Fighters Guild&lt;/a&gt; hunters help defeat the Daedric Titan, and by extension, the invasion force. The Titan was slain when a spear was plunged its gullet, and it was cut gravely from the armpit. Lightning had struck Dune's walls and streets, as the storms of Coldharbour had enveloped the skies of Dawnmead. Ultimately, these hunters died in combat, but Dune was saved and rebuilt without a moment's notice.\nThe Second Battle of Dune &amp; the Lunar Champion.\nDuring the &lt;a href=\"Interregnum\"&gt;Interregnum&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"2E%20582\"&gt;2E 582&lt;/a&gt;, the city-state of Dune was once again attacked by the Daedra, from the warlocks of the &lt;a href=\"Stonefire%20Cult\"&gt;Stonefire Cult&lt;/a&gt;. The &lt;a href=\"First%20Aldmeri%20Dominion\"&gt;First Aldmeri Dominion&lt;/a&gt;, under the command of &lt;a href=\"Queen%20Ayrenn\"&gt;Queen Ayrenn&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Lunar%20Champion\"&gt;Lunar Champion&lt;/a&gt;, fought the Daedra at Dune, with the &lt;a href=\"Vestige\"&gt;Moon Hallowed&lt;/a&gt; traversing around the battlefield and closing portals in the city. &lt;a href=\"Javad%20Tharn\"&gt;Javad Tharn&lt;/a&gt; had infiltrated the &lt;a href=\"Two%20Moons%20Path\"&gt;Two Moons Path&lt;/a&gt;, with the newly-named Dark Mane, the Lunar Champion's twin sister. After a grueling battle deep in the &lt;a href=\"Den%20of%20Lorkhaj\"&gt;Den of Lorkhaj&lt;/a&gt;, Tharn and the Dark Mane were killed. The Lunar Champion traveled further the Two Moons Path, where the Lunar Champion continued their journey and was named the &lt;a href=\"Mane\"&gt;Mane&lt;/a&gt; of Elsweyr. From then on, the three provinces of the Dominion were at peace with one another, paving the way for a bright future. But a call to action would arrive when &lt;a href=\"Vanus%20Galerion\"&gt;Vanus Galerion&lt;/a&gt; approached the Moon Hallowed.\n&lt;a href=\"Third%20Era\"&gt;Third Era&lt;/a&gt;.\nDune during the Imperial Simulacrum.\nDuring the &lt;a href=\"Imperial%20Simulacrum\"&gt;Imperial Simulacrum&lt;/a&gt; from &lt;a href=\"3E%20389\"&gt;3E 389&lt;/a&gt; to &lt;a href=\"3E%20399\"&gt;3E 399&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Emperor\"&gt;Emperor&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Uriel%20Septim%20VII\"&gt;Uriel Septim VII&lt;/a&gt; was imprisoned along with &lt;a href=\"Talin%20Warhaft\"&gt;Talin Warhaft&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;a href=\"Deadlands\"&gt;Deadlands&lt;/a&gt; by &lt;a href=\"Jagar%20Tharn\"&gt;Jagar Tharn&lt;/a&gt;. Tharn planned for months to capture the throne, and he was able to achieve so in the span of ten years. Tharn had a powerful weapon called the &lt;a href=\"Staff%20of%20Chaos\"&gt;Staff of Chaos&lt;/a&gt;, and he split it into nine pieces and scattered them across Tamriel, the staff was the only thing keeping Uriel Septim and Warhaft in &lt;a href=\"Oblivion\"&gt;Oblivion&lt;/a&gt;. A warrior escaped his clutches and traveled all corners of Tamriel to retrieve the missing pieces. The hero was known as the &lt;a href=\"Eternal%20Champion\"&gt;Eternal Champion&lt;/a&gt;, and he assembled the staff and defeated Jagar Tharn at the &lt;a href=\"Imperial%20Palace\"&gt;Imperial Palace&lt;/a&gt;. The Eternal Champion had at one point visited the city of Dune in their quest to recover the pieces. The city of Dune was under the rule of &lt;a href=\"King%20Ab%27ir\"&gt;King Ab'ir&lt;/a&gt;."}

These are the dungeons related to the &lt;a href=\"Main%20Quest%20%28Arena%29\"&gt;main quest&lt;/a&gt; of the game:\nRandom dungeons.\nEach province contains fourteen random dungeons that can be unlocked by accepting random &lt;a href=\"Side%20Quests%20%28Arena%29\"&gt;side quests&lt;/a&gt;. These are fixed in number and location, but not in name, which is determined at the time of the quest. Random dungeons are composed of two or four square blocks with two exits on each side; the stair location leading to the next level is always in the same spot in the northeastern part of the block. The stairs leading to the upper and lower floors are almost always situated due east or west of each other.\n&lt;a href=\"Crypts%20%28Arena%29\"&gt;Crypts&lt;/a&gt;.\nCrypts are small, single-level dungeons occasionally found in the wilderness and distinguished by proximity to nearby graveyards.

They always contain one or more &lt;a href=\"Boss%20%28Online%29\"&gt;bosses&lt;/a&gt;, large amounts of enemies and loot. Dungeons may also contain &lt;a href=\"Containers%20%28Online%29\"&gt;chests&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Quests%20%28Online%29\"&gt;quests&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Skyshards%20%28Online%29\"&gt;skyshards&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Ingredients%20%28Online%29\"&gt;ingredients&lt;/a&gt;, collectible &lt;a href=\"Books%20%28Online%29\"&gt;books&lt;/a&gt; and other items.\nWhile Dungeons are usually not actual dungeons, the term has been universally used by many other MMO and RPG players to refer to any kind of indoor or outdoor instance that is separate from the main world.\nGroup Dungeons and &lt;a href=\"Trials\"&gt;Trials&lt;/a&gt; will scale to you or your group leader's level if entered manually, but do not scale below the level they are introduced. For example, &lt;a href=\"Fungal%20Grotto\"&gt;Fungal Grotto&lt;/a&gt; begins scaling to your level from level 12 but does not scale below that. Trials, which are made for 12-man groups, are similar to Group Dungeons. Trials are also called Raids, which is an MMO term used for a large group instance.\nThere are exactly 144 dungeons and Trials in the game's initial version (145 if you include the &lt;a href=\"Dragonstar%20Arena\"&gt;Dragonstar Arena&lt;/a&gt;), and 136 are dungeons, delves and other group instances, the other 3 are Trials. There are 6 delves, 1 public dungeon and 1 group dungeon per zone, with the exception of &lt;a href=\"Khenarthi%27s%20Roost\"&gt;Khenarthi's Roost&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Betnikh\"&gt;Betnikh&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Stros%20M%27kai%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Stros M'kai&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Bleakrock\"&gt;Bleakrock&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Bal%20Foyen\"&gt;Bal Foyen&lt;/a&gt;, which have no dungeons at all, and &lt;a href=\"Craglorn\"&gt;Craglorn&lt;/a&gt;, which has no solo or public dungeons but has 29 group dungeons, 30 if you count the &lt;a href=\"Dragonstar%20Arena\"&gt;Dragonstar Arena&lt;/a&gt;.\nModes.\nGroup Dungeons and Trials have two modes which determine both the difficulty, type of monsters, quests, explorable area and storyline in the dungeon. The first is Normal mode, which is the mode of the dungeon when it is first introduced. The second is Veteran Mode which unlocks a new storyline, a new quest, new explorable areas of the dungeon sometimes and a new difficulty optimized for &lt;a href=\"Veteran%20Levels\"&gt;Veteran Rank&lt;/a&gt; players.\nNot all dungeons have Veteran modes, but more are continuously added through updates. The most recent dungeon to get the Veteran mode treatment is the &lt;a href=\"City%20of%20Ash\"&gt;City of Ash&lt;/a&gt;, which it received in &lt;a href=\"Update%205\"&gt;Update 5&lt;/a&gt; (November 3rd, 2014).\nPledges.\nEvery real-world day, a player above Level 45 has access to Pledges, which are repeatable quests given by the &lt;a href=\"Undaunted\"&gt;Undaunted&lt;/a&gt;. They consist in completing a certain group dungeon to earn special rewards. Pledges are given by &lt;a href=\"Maj%20al-Ragath\"&gt;Maj al-Ragath&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Glirion%20the%20Redbeard\"&gt;Glirion the Redbeard&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;a href=\"Undaunted%20Enclave\"&gt;Undaunted Enclave&lt;/a&gt; of the &lt;a href=\"Vestige\"&gt;Vestige&lt;/a&gt;'s alliance, located outside the cities of (&lt;a href=\"Mournhold%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Mournhold&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Wayrest%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Wayrest&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Elden%20Root%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Elden Root&lt;/a&gt;).\nThere are two types of pledges, a non-veteran pledge and a Veteran pledge, which are unlocked at Level 45 and Champion Point 1, respectively. Non-veteran pledges will send your group into a normal dungeon, while a Veteran pledge will send your group into a Veteran dungeon.\nUpon defeating a boss, each player will receive a special key which is used to unlock special chests in the &lt;a href=\"Undaunted%20Enclave\"&gt;Undaunted Enclave&lt;/a&gt;. There are bronze, silver and gold chests, and to open one requires the corresponding key obtained from the NPC that assigned the pledge upon completion.\nWhile a key is guaranteed to be obtained if your group completes the specific daily pledge for that dungeon, the quality of the key is determined by both the type of pledge and whether optional objectives have been fulfilled. When a chest is opened, you have a chance to receive special rewards such as special armor and weapon sets, among others, and the rewards are better with the higher the quality of the chest opened.\nPledge quests.\n&lt;onlyinclude&gt;&lt;/onlyinclude&gt;"}

This is visible on the map with a diamond-shaped marker underneath the dungeon name, with the word \"Cleared\" beside it.\nThis is for the most part purely visual, but is used as a conditions for the \"&lt;a href=\"Delver\"&gt;Delver&lt;/a&gt;\" &lt;a href=\"Achievements%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;achievement&lt;/a&gt;, as well as for completion criteria for certain &lt;a href=\"radiant%20quests\"&gt;radiant quests&lt;/a&gt;.\nA dungeon being marked as cleared does not affect whether or not its enemies will respawn, contrary to what the name might suggest. A dungeon will usually have it's inhabitants respawn after the normal amount of 30 days. A dungeons status as cleared will remain even after it's inhabitants have respawned.\nClearable dungeons.\nThere is a total of 198 clearable dungeons.\nCamps.\nThere are six clearable camps.\nCaves.\nThere are 62 clearable caves.\nClearings.\nThere are four clearable clearings.\nDragon Lairs.\nThere are 11 clearable dragon lairs.\nDwarven Ruins.\nThere are 10 clearable dwarven ruins.\nForts.\nThere are 16 clearable forts.\nGiant Camps.\nThere are 12 clearable giant camps.\nGroves.\nThere are four clearable groves.\nLandmarks.\nThere are four clearable landmarks.\nLighthouses.\nThere is one clearable lighthouse.\nMines.\nThere are three clearable mines.\nNordic Tombs.\nThere are 41 clearable Nordic tombs.\nNordic Towers.\nThere are six clearable nordic towers.\nShacks.\nThere are five clearable shacks.\nShips and Shipwrecks.\nThere are six clearable ships and shipwrecks.\nWatchtowers.\nThere are seven clearable watchtowers.\nNon-Respawning Dungeons.\nNon-Respawning dungeons will never reset once they are completed. As such, items can safely be stored inside containers within them.\nQuests.\nSome dungeons contains quests that can be started usually by talking to &lt;a href=\"Characters%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;characters&lt;/a&gt;, finding specific &lt;a href=\"Items%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;items&lt;/a&gt;, or reading &lt;a href=\"Books%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;books&lt;/a&gt; inside or outside dungeons.\nDungeon Lock Outs.\nThere are some dungeons that require certain quests to be active before they can be accessed."}

Known to be strong, intelligent, quick, aloof, and reserved, but considered by some to be ill-fated. Dunmer tend to keep to themselves, as most Dunmer natives of Morrowind harbor a bitter distrust and disdain for other &lt;a href=\"races\"&gt;races&lt;/a&gt;, considering themselves superior.\nMorrowind.\nThe province of Morrowind, formerly known as &lt;a href=\"Resdayn\"&gt;Resdayn&lt;/a&gt;, is located in the northeastern corner of &lt;a href=\"Tamriel\"&gt;Tamriel&lt;/a&gt;. It is composed of two main parts: the mainland and the island of &lt;a href=\"Vvardenfell\"&gt;Vvardenfell&lt;/a&gt;, which are separated by the &lt;a href=\"Inner%20Sea\"&gt;Inner Sea&lt;/a&gt;. The mainland has always harbored the capital of Morrowind; it being &lt;a href=\"Mournhold\"&gt;Mournhold&lt;/a&gt; (also called Almalexia) for much of its history, but moved to &lt;a href=\"Blacklight\"&gt;Blacklight&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;a href=\"Fourth%20Era\"&gt;Fourth Era&lt;/a&gt; due to the &lt;a href=\"Argonian\"&gt;Argonian&lt;/a&gt; invasion that destroyed most of the southern region of Morrowind. The mainland also harbors very different climates and types of vegetation; ranging from swamps and forests to the &lt;a href=\"Deshaan%20Plains\"&gt;Deshaan Plains&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Velothi%20Mountains\"&gt;Velothi Mountains&lt;/a&gt;. The island of &lt;a href=\"Vvardenfell\"&gt;Vvardenfell&lt;/a&gt;, on the other hand, is generally comprised of ash wastes due to the presence of the &lt;a href=\"Red%20Mountain\"&gt;Red Mountain&lt;/a&gt;, and until the &lt;a href=\"Red%20Year\"&gt;Red Year&lt;/a&gt; was largely inhabited by the &lt;a href=\"Ashlander\"&gt;Ashlander&lt;/a&gt; tribes, and members of the &lt;a href=\"Tribunal%20Temple\"&gt;Tribunal Temple&lt;/a&gt; and three of Morrowind's five &lt;a href=\"Great%20Houses\"&gt;Great Houses&lt;/a&gt;: &lt;a href=\"House%20Hlaalu\"&gt;Hlaalu&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"House%20Redoran\"&gt;Redoran&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"House%20Telvanni\"&gt;Telvanni&lt;/a&gt;.\nIn the &lt;a href=\"Third%20Era\"&gt;Third Era&lt;/a&gt; the &lt;a href=\"Tribunal\"&gt;Tribunal&lt;/a&gt;'s representatives, the Temple, were the major political force in Morrowind, with the five Great Houses (&lt;a href=\"Dres\"&gt;Dres&lt;/a&gt;, Hlaalu, &lt;a href=\"House%20Indoril\"&gt;Indoril&lt;/a&gt;, Redoran and Telvanni) coming right after. After the events of the &lt;a href=\"Nerevarine\"&gt;Nerevarine&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Red%20Year\"&gt;Red Year&lt;/a&gt; the Tribunal has been killed and overthrown, although the Temple still has a lot of influence over Morrowind's affairs, having reverted to worship of the &lt;a href=\"Daedric%20Princes\"&gt;Daedric Princes&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Mephala\"&gt;Mephala&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Boethiah\"&gt;Boethiah&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Azura\"&gt;Azura&lt;/a&gt;. Until the end of the &lt;a href=\"Third%20Era\"&gt;Third Era&lt;/a&gt; Morrowind was nominally ruled by &lt;a href=\"Helseth%20Hlaalu\"&gt;King Hlaalu Helseth&lt;/a&gt; from the city of Mournhold, with real governance in the hands of the Grand Council. however, given the destruction of Mournhold in the Red Year and House Hlaalu's fall from political favor, it is not likely that this is still the case.\nIts cities (many of which are almost completely destroyed following the eruption of Red Mountain in 4E 5) include: &lt;a href=\"Vivec%20City\"&gt;Vivec&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Mournhold\"&gt;Mournhold&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Balmora\"&gt;Balmora&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Sadrith%20Mora\"&gt;Sadrith Mora&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Ald%27ruhn\"&gt;Ald'ruhn&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Blacklight\"&gt;Blacklight&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Necrom\"&gt;Necrom&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Narsis\"&gt;Narsis&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Tear\"&gt;Tear&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Gnisis\"&gt;Gnisis&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Port%20Telvannis\"&gt;Port Telvannis&lt;/a&gt;.\nPhysiology.\nMost Dunmer have red, glowing eyes with skin tones varying from somewhat greenish and the more common gray to the occasional light blue. They are known to be strong, intelligent, and quick, however, they are also said to be ill favored by fate. Both male and female Dunmer have a height similar to most of the human races. This means that they are generally taller than their &lt;a href=\"Bosmer\"&gt;Bosmer&lt;/a&gt; cousins and shorter than the &lt;a href=\"Altmer\"&gt;Altmer&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe current form the Dunmer take was changed from that of the &lt;a href=\"Chimer\"&gt;Chimer&lt;/a&gt; by Azura, as a curse for the actions of the Tribunal in either using &lt;a href=\"Kagrenac%27s%20Tools\"&gt;Kagrenac's Tools&lt;/a&gt;, or murdering &lt;a href=\"Nerevar\"&gt;Nerevar&lt;/a&gt;. The Chimer were very similar in appearance to the &lt;a href=\"Altmer\"&gt;Altmer&lt;/a&gt;, having golden skin.\n&lt;a href=\"Maramal\"&gt;Maramal&lt;/a&gt;'s conversation with &lt;a href=\"Dinya%20Balu\"&gt;Dinya Balu&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;a href=\"Temple%20of%20Mara%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Temple of Mara&lt;/a&gt; demonstrates that &lt;a href=\"Redguards\"&gt;Redguards&lt;/a&gt; and Dunmer are cross-fertile.\nHistory.\nThe Dunmer were once the Chimer (Changed Folk, or Changed Ones), who were several clans of mer who &lt;a href=\"Boethiah\"&gt;Boethiah&lt;/a&gt; convinced to abandon the customs and laws of the &lt;a href=\"Summerset%20Isles\"&gt;Summerset Isles&lt;/a&gt;, and follow the prophet &lt;a href=\"Veloth\"&gt;Veloth&lt;/a&gt; in a great exodus to Resdayn. At the time of exodus the exiles were also known as the Velothi. The term can be used in a general sense for the Dunmer as well, though after the exodus it generally carried a specific meaning referring to those who maintain the original nomadic lifestyle of Veloth's followers, rather than that of the settled Great Houses.\nThe exiles settled in Resdayn and flourished, developing what is now known as Velothi High Culture, based on worship of the three Good Daedra and respect for the House of Troubles and the new customs. The ruins of &lt;a href=\"Dunmer%20Strongholds\"&gt;Dunmer Strongholds&lt;/a&gt; that dot Morrowind are attributed to this period. On their arrival, they found the Dwemer already settled there, and much of the early history of Resdayn is of Chimer-Dwemer conflict.\nDisunity allowed the &lt;a href=\"Nords\"&gt;Nords&lt;/a&gt; to conquer Morrowind and rule for many years until fighting of their own in an event known as the &lt;a href=\"War%20of%20Succession\"&gt;War of Succession&lt;/a&gt; allowed the Chimer and Dwemer, led by Indoril Nerevar and &lt;a href=\"Dumac%20Dwarfking\"&gt;Dumac Dwarfking&lt;/a&gt;, to form an alliance against the Nords, and oust the occupiers, creating the &lt;a href=\"First%20Council\"&gt;First Council&lt;/a&gt;.\nAzura's curse and the Chimer's transformation.\nWar ultimately erupted between the Dwemer and the Chimer, over religious differences that had their root in the Dwemer's use of the &lt;a href=\"Heart%20of%20Lorkhan\"&gt;Heart of Lorkhan&lt;/a&gt;. This culminated in the &lt;a href=\"Battle%20of%20Red%20Mountain\"&gt;Battle of Red Mountain&lt;/a&gt;, which resulted in the disappearance of the Dwemer and the annihilation of their &lt;a href=\"House%20Dagoth\"&gt;House Dagoth&lt;/a&gt; allies. Nerevar dies soon after the battle, either from wounds sustained in the battle, or was murdered by the &lt;a href=\"Tribunal\"&gt;Tribunal&lt;/a&gt;, three of his closest advisors.\nThe Tribunal's actions, either in using the tools to become gods, or in murdering Nerevar, caused Azura to curse the Tribunal and the Chimer people, turning their skin to ash and their eyes red, making them the Dunmer.\nRed Year.\nAfter the fall of &lt;a href=\"Baar%20Dau\"&gt;Baar Dau&lt;/a&gt; and subsequent eruption of &lt;a href=\"Red%20Mountain\"&gt;Red Mountain&lt;/a&gt; destroyed much of Morrowind, many Dunmer fled to &lt;a href=\"Skyrim\"&gt;Skyrim&lt;/a&gt; as refugees. Many eventually settled on the island of &lt;a href=\"Solstheim\"&gt;Solstheim&lt;/a&gt;, which was given to them by the High King of Skyrim at the time. Many more fled to &lt;a href=\"Windhelm\"&gt;Windhelm&lt;/a&gt;, the seat of the &lt;a href=\"Stormcloaks\"&gt;Stormcloaks&lt;/a&gt; resistance against the &lt;a href=\"Empire%20of%20Tamriel\"&gt;Empire of Tamriel&lt;/a&gt;. They live there in the &lt;a href=\"Gray%20Quarter\"&gt;Gray Quarter&lt;/a&gt;.\nBefore the cataclysm that lead to the mass exodus of Dunmer, several of the faithful of &lt;a href=\"Azura\"&gt;Azura&lt;/a&gt; received visions of the eruption of Red Mountain. Setting out for &lt;a href=\"Winterhold%20%28City%29\"&gt;Winterhold&lt;/a&gt;, these Dunmer built the &lt;a href=\"Shrine%20of%20Azura%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Shrine of Azura&lt;/a&gt; in Skyrim. The only remaining member of this group is &lt;a href=\"Aranea%20Ienith\"&gt;Aranea Ienith&lt;/a&gt;. In the months after the cataclysm, many Dunmer started to return home to rebuild, only to be met by an invading force of Argonians.\nCulture.\nThere are two major cultural groups among the Dunmer: the Great Houses, and the &lt;a href=\"Ashlanders\"&gt;Ashlanders&lt;/a&gt;.\nGreat Houses.\nThe Great Houses have their origins in ancient Velothi tribes, and function effectively as political parties within the Morrowind polity, as well as controlling much of the trade and local administration in the province.\nRepresentatives from each of the Great Houses form the Grand Council, which has ruled Morrowind since the late &lt;a href=\"First%20Era\"&gt;First Era&lt;/a&gt;. The Houses themselves also have ruling councils, which enforce House policy and conduct.\nGreat Houses that have been referenced in the games to date are House Dagoth, House Dres, House Hlaalu, House Indoril, House Redoran, &lt;a href=\"House%20Sadras\"&gt;House Sadras&lt;/a&gt; and House Telvanni. All but House Dagoth and House Sadras had a stake in Morrowind's governance for most of its history. House Dagoth was destroyed following the events at the Battle of Red Mountain, while House Sadras replaced House Hlaalu following the Red Year. During the time of Resdayn in the First Era, the Dwemer were also accorded the status of a House, referred to as \"House Dwemer.\"\nAshlanders.\nAshlanders claim to be the direct descendants of the &lt;a href=\"Aldmer\"&gt;Aldmer&lt;/a&gt;i peoples who followed the prophet Veloth into the lands now called Morrowind. They live in camps of small, mobile huts, herding guar, and hunting wildlife for meat and hides. Ashlanders claim it is their right to raid settlements and other tribes for plunder and slaves. The Ashlanders worship their ancestors and are led by their Ashkhan, or warchiefs, and are counseled by the arcane wisdom and prophecies of their wise women.\nThe Ashlander culture is an anachronistic survival of the ancestor worshiping tribal culture from which the Great Houses emerged. They see the worship of living Dunmer, the practice of the Tribunal Temple, as an abomination. The &lt;a href=\"Nerevarine%20Cult\"&gt;Nerevarine Cult&lt;/a&gt; can be seen as such an ancestor cult.\nReligion.\nAshlander worship.\nThe ancient Velothi acknowledged &lt;a href=\"Boethiah\"&gt;Boethiah&lt;/a&gt;, Mephala and Azura as their primary figures of worship, with ancestor worship also a prominent feature. Sheogorath, Mehrunes Dagon, Malacath and Molag Bal are acknowledged as the \"House of Troubles,\" testing figures to not be worshipped but dealt with caution. Following the Tribunal's apotheosis, the Great House Dunmer began to worship the Tribunal, with only House Dres openly still worshiping the Daedra.\nHowever, the Ashlanders remained worshipers of the Daedric Lords Boethiah, Mephala, and Azura; this has caused many conflicts between the Temple and the Ashlanders. Another core facet of their belief system is the prophecy involving the &lt;a href=\"Nerevarine\"&gt;Nerevarine&lt;/a&gt;, that is meant to save the native Dunmer from outlanders.\nFollowing the fall of the Tribunal and the establishment of the &lt;a href=\"New%20Temple\"&gt;New Temple&lt;/a&gt;, Daedra worship was restored among the House Dunmer, and Ashlanders regarded as guardians of the \"true way.\"\nThe Temple.\nTribunal period.\nThe Tribunal Temple was dedicated to the worship of the three god-kings of Morrowind known as the Tribunal. The Tribunal is composed of the goddess Almalexia, the god-poet Vivec, and Sotha Sil. It was the dominant religion in the province of Morrowind, until after the Red Year.\nAccording to the temple, the three Daedra that recognized the divinity of the Tribunal were Azura, Boethiah, and Mephala. These three Daedra are known as the \"Anticipations\" because they share the same aspects and spheres as each member of the Tribunal. Each Daedra is an anticipation for each of the Tribune; Azura is the anticipation of Sotha Sil, Boethiah is the anticipation of Almalexia, and Mephala is the anticipation of Vivec. The House of Troubles did not acknowledge the divinity of the Tribunal, and therefore continued in their role as testing figures and tricksters, and their worship was forbidden by the Temple.\nAs well as worship of the Tribunal and veneration of the Anticipations, the Temple encouraged a pantheon of saints whose example should be followed in order to live a virtuous life.\nThe New Temple.\nAfter the events of , Sotha Sil and Almalexia were killed, and Vivec disappeared. This caused a crisis of faith among the Dunmer people, and the &lt;a href=\"Dissident%20Priests\"&gt;Dissident Priests&lt;/a&gt;, formerly persecuted, rose to control the Temple. Ultimately, the Temple went back to worshiping the Daedric Lords Boethiah, Mephala, and Azura, styled as \"the Reclamations,\" as they reclaimed their proper place of worship. Almalexia, Sotha Sil and Vivec were relegated to the status of saints within the new pantheon.\nLanguage.\nDunmeri is the common language of the Dunmer. It is descended from Aldmeri, the language of the first elves, and written using the &lt;a href=\"Daedric%20alphabet\"&gt;Daedric alphabet&lt;/a&gt;."}

Adept with &lt;a href=\"Weapons%20%28Morrowind%29\"&gt;sword&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Magicka%20%28Morrowind%29\"&gt;magic&lt;/a&gt;, Dunmer are a versatile &lt;a href=\"Races%20%28Morrowind%29\"&gt;race&lt;/a&gt;.\nHistory.\nAncestry.\nThe Dunmer were once the &lt;a href=\"Chimer\"&gt;Chimer&lt;/a&gt; (Changed Folk, or The Changed Ones), who were a people of the Altmeri who had abandoned the ways, customs and laws of the &lt;a href=\"Summerset%20Isles\"&gt;Summerset Isles&lt;/a&gt;, and embarked on a great exodus to Morrowind. They followed the &lt;a href=\"Veloth\"&gt;Veloth&lt;/a&gt;, who spoke to them on behalf of Boethiah, the &lt;a href=\"Daedric%20Princes\"&gt;Daedric Prince&lt;/a&gt; of Plots. These teachings spawned a new culture on &lt;a href=\"Tamriel\"&gt;Tamriel&lt;/a&gt; and a new people, even though the Chimer were physically indistinguishable from &lt;a href=\"Altmer\"&gt;Altmer&lt;/a&gt;. At the time of exodus and until their change, the exiles were known as the Velothi. The term can be used in a general sense for the Dunmer as well, though it carries a specific meaning referring to ex-Ashlanders who abandoned their nomadic societies.\nAt the time of the Velothi's mass exodus, Morrowind was known as Dwemereth, after the enigmatic &lt;a href=\"Dwemer\"&gt;Dwemer&lt;/a&gt; who already inhabited the region. The exiles settled there and flourished, developing what is now known as Velothi High Culture, based on worship of the three Good Daedra and respect for the House of Troubles and the new customs. The ruins of Velothi Towers that now dot Morrowind are attributed to this period and are only common to tell-tale stories made up of legendary proportion.\nSometime around the rise of the &lt;a href=\"First%20Empire\"&gt;First Empire&lt;/a&gt; of the &lt;a href=\"Nords%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;Nords&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Skyrim\"&gt;Skyrim&lt;/a&gt;, the Velothi civilization broke down into a relatively primitive collection of clans and tribal warfare. Because of the slave revolt, many Strongholds went into opposition to hide and protect &lt;a href=\"Vvardenfell%20%28Morrowind%29\"&gt;Vvardenfell&lt;/a&gt;'s borders from the Early Nord Skirmish squads. The so-called Dunmer Strongholds of Morrowind were most likely built at this time, for defense against Nordic raiders and other Chimer too, who did not seek exile with the rest at the time of exodus. Such disunity allowed Skyrim to conquer Morrowind. The Nords ruled Morrowind, now called &lt;a href=\"Resdayn\"&gt;Resdayn&lt;/a&gt;, under the reign of semi-corrupt Nord Tyrants for many years, until fighting of their own (the War of Succession) allowed the Chimer and Dwemer to form an alliance against the vulnerable and rebellious Nords, and oust the occupiers.\nAzura's Curse and the Chimer's Transformation.\nThis was the &lt;a href=\"First%20Era\"&gt;era&lt;/a&gt; of the &lt;a href=\"First%20Council\"&gt;First Council&lt;/a&gt;, when the modern &lt;a href=\"Great%20House\"&gt;Great House&lt;/a&gt; system was in productions form but already developing, with &lt;a href=\"Indoril%20Nerevar\"&gt;Indoril Nerevar&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Moon-and-Star\"&gt;Moon-and-Star&lt;/a&gt; and his three advisors (the &lt;a href=\"Tribunal\"&gt;Tribunal&lt;/a&gt; ; Almsivi) at the fore. This included &lt;a href=\"Almalexia%20%28Tribunal%29\"&gt;Almalexia&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Vivec\"&gt;Vivec&lt;/a&gt; the warrior-poet, and &lt;a href=\"Sotha%20Sil\"&gt;Sotha Sil&lt;/a&gt;. As every student of eastern history knows, the union did not last long. After a supposed summoning of Azura at &lt;a href=\"Red%20Mountain\"&gt;Red Mountain&lt;/a&gt;, where the Dwemer and Chimer fought the last of the opposing forces, Azura laid her curse upon the already-exiled Chimer. The supposed murder of Indoril Nerevar Moon-and-Star by the summoning ritual made by the Tribunal, Azura appeared, with Indoril dead, and her words hissed: ' May the eyes of the Changed Ones be turned as red as this volcanic ash, and may their skin be as blackened as their hearts. The accursed drawn, blood from the master spilled, and a curse shown in the race of these folk, forever-more'.\nThis led to the hiding of Vivec in the Ministry of Truth and the recession of the cultures of the now accursed Chimer. Azura withdrew from the mountain, and there upon the now-Dunmer lay with ashen souls, and would reflect change in the Eras to come.\nModern Beliefs.\nAfter the Nordic occupation of Morrowind, many Dunmer remained distrustful of outsiders, which is likely where their hatred for 'Outlanders' came from. The native Dunmer especially hate Dunmer who were not born on Morrowind, regarding them with suspicion, and seeing them as 'impure'. If the player chooses to be a Dunmer on , they will still be called an 'outlander', as they were born somewhere else entirely.\nDespite not liking outlanders, the Dunmer will still allow them to join the local guilds, and some even excel in them. For example, the &lt;a href=\"Morag%20Tong%20%28Morrowind%29\"&gt;Morag Tong&lt;/a&gt;, Morrowind's local assassin's guild, will allow outlanders into its ranks. The &lt;a href=\"Great%20Houses\"&gt;Great Houses&lt;/a&gt; will as well; &lt;a href=\"House%20Hlaalu\"&gt;House Hlaalu&lt;/a&gt; is the most sympathetic towards outlanders, but the others will still allow them to join their ranks.\nGods.\nGods worshiped by the Dunmer folk of Morrowind include: \nStrategy.\nDark Elves start off with a very diverse range of skills, so they can be a fighter, archer or mage."}

Offensive Spells seem to prove worthy alongside a &lt;a href=\"Mage%20%28Class%29\"&gt;spellcasting&lt;/a&gt; Dunmer in battle.\nThey are grim, aloof, and reserved, keeping to themselves as much as possible. They are just as distrusting and disdainful of other &lt;a href=\"Races%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;races&lt;/a&gt; as they are to other Dark Elves. The Dunmer and their national character embrace these various connotations with enthusiastic behaviors. In the &lt;a href=\"Empire\"&gt;Empire&lt;/a&gt;, 'Dark Elf' is the common used term used by any &lt;a href=\"human\"&gt;human&lt;/a&gt;oid race, but in their homeland, Morrowind, and among their &lt;a href=\"Aldmer\"&gt;Aldmer&lt;/a&gt;i brethren, they are known as Dunmer.\nReligion.\nIn Morrowind, the main religion is the worship of the &lt;a href=\"Tribunal%20Temple\"&gt;Tribunal Temple&lt;/a&gt; but a large number of Dunmer also worship &lt;a href=\"Daedric\"&gt;Daedric&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"deities\"&gt;deities&lt;/a&gt;.

The &lt;a href=\"Citizen\"&gt;commoners&lt;/a&gt; ban their behaviors with harsh distrust.

Setting out for &lt;a href=\"Winterhold%20%28Skyrim%20City%29\"&gt;Winterhold&lt;/a&gt;, these Dunmer built the &lt;a href=\"Shrine%20of%20Azura%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Shrine of Azura&lt;/a&gt; and remained there as priests and priestesses, though they eventually left over time, driven away by the fear of learning their future through the visions that Azura provided. By &lt;a href=\"4E%20201\"&gt;4E 201&lt;/a&gt;, only one remained, &lt;a href=\"Aranea%20Ienith\"&gt;Aranea Ienith&lt;/a&gt;.\nCharacter creation.\nStarting spells.\nAll races start the game with Flames and Healing, but only Dunmeri characters have immediate access to Sparks.\nPopular usage and unique gameplay.\nThe Dunmer is a versatile race that can fill almost any role, as a result of their racial powers and skill bonuses.\nCombat, Stealth, and Magic.\nThe Dunmer racial power, &lt;a href=\"Ancestor%27s%20Wrath\"&gt;Ancestor's Wrath&lt;/a&gt;, causes &lt;a href=\"Fire%20Damage%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;fire damage&lt;/a&gt; to any foe within melee range, which seems to benefit most from a melee fighter play-style. Their 50% resistance to fire is very useful when fighting against creatures with fire-based attacks, such as &lt;a href=\"Dragons%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;dragons&lt;/a&gt;, mages, and &lt;a href=\"Flame%20Atronach%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;flame atronachs&lt;/a&gt;. It can confer a natural immunity to heat without having to rely on enchanted apparel, such as &lt;a href=\"Ahzidal%20%28Mask%29\"&gt;Ahzidal&lt;/a&gt;'s or &lt;a href=\"Otar%20%28Mask%29\"&gt;Otar&lt;/a&gt;'s masks.\nIn terms of skills, the Dunmer is an advantageous race for &lt;a href=\"The%20Thief%20Stone%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;thieves&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"assassin\"&gt;assassin&lt;/a&gt;s and &lt;a href=\"mage\"&gt;mage&lt;/a&gt;s, as they offer a good balance of stealth and magical talent. This race provides a middle ground between the other &lt;a href=\"Mer\"&gt;Mer&lt;/a&gt; species, as the &lt;a href=\"Bosmer%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Bosmer&lt;/a&gt; are adept at stealth and the &lt;a href=\"Altmer%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Altmer&lt;/a&gt; are experts of magic.\nThe Dunmer are known for their aptitude in magic, especially destruction magic. Dunmer also have increased abilities in other magical classes, including Alteration and Illusion.\nVampires.\nSeeing as they have a natural resistance against fire, Dunmer could also effectively be used when playing as a &lt;a href=\"Vampirism%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Vampire&lt;/a&gt; with the add-on. As Stage IV vampires have 50% &lt;a href=\"Weakness%20to%20Fire%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;weakness to fire&lt;/a&gt;, the Dunmer's resistance counteracts this penalty almost entirely."}

Yet you deny us even this courtesy. You, and the white-skinned, jaundice-haired apes of this godforsaken frozen wilderness. To you &lt;a href=\"Nords%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Nord&lt;/a&gt;s, we are the gray ones, the ashen-skinned, the \"dark elves\" of &lt;a href=\"Morrowind\"&gt;Morrowind&lt;/a&gt; who have as much place in your land as an infection in an open wound.\nOh yes, we have read your great cultural work, \"&lt;a href=\"Nords%20of%20Skyrim\"&gt;Nords of Skyrim&lt;/a&gt;,\" in which you extol the many virtues of your people and province, and invite any visitors to come experience your homeland for themselves. Well come we did, Nords, and the reception was less than was promised - but exactly what we expected.\nSo I, , Dunmer and immigrant to &lt;a href=\"Skyrim\"&gt;Skyrim&lt;/a&gt;, have decided to answer your beloved book with a work of my own. And let all who read it know that Nords are not the only race to reside in this cold and inhospitable realm. For we dark elves have come, and little by little, shall claim Skyrim as our own.\nBut where, you may ask, have we taken up residence? Why none other than the ancient city of &lt;a href=\"Windhelm%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Windhelm&lt;/a&gt;, once the capital of the &lt;a href=\"First%20Empire\"&gt;First Empire&lt;/a&gt;. Yes, Nords, in the shadow of your own &lt;a href=\"Palace%20of%20the%20Kings\"&gt;Palace of the Kings&lt;/a&gt;, where the Nord hero &lt;a href=\"Ysgramor%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Ysgramor&lt;/a&gt; once held court, we now thrive. Oh yes. Your beloved &lt;a href=\"Five%20Hundred%20Companions\"&gt;Five Hundred Companions&lt;/a&gt; may have driven our ancestors from Skyrim, but that was then. This is now.\nIndeed, one might be surprised as to just how well we've settled into Windhelm. The district once known as the Snow Quarter is thus named no more. Now, they call it the &lt;a href=\"Gray%20Quarter\"&gt;Gray Quarter&lt;/a&gt;, for such is the reality of the Dunmer occupation. The district is now populated entirely by my kind, a victory not lost on its residents.\nOh, but the peaceful occupation goes even further. Thirsty? You'll find no Nord mead hall in the Gray Quarter. But the spirits flow well enough in the &lt;a href=\"New%20Gnisis%20Cornerclub\"&gt;New Gnisis Cornerclub&lt;/a&gt;. Seeking a respected family? You'll find no Gray-Manes within these walls. But perhaps you'd like to pay a visit to the home of &lt;a href=\"Belyn%20Hlaalu\"&gt;Belyn Hlaalu&lt;/a&gt;, descendant of one of the most noble &lt;a href=\"House%20Hlaalu\"&gt;houses&lt;/a&gt; in all of Morrowind. Ah, but no. You Nords don't come to the Gray Quarter, do you? You fear our streets as you fear our skin.\nSo now, \"children of Skyrim,\" you have the truth of it. You may call this province home, but you can no sooner claim to own it than a cow can claim to own its master's field. You are just another breed of domestic animal, grazing stupidly while higher beings plot your slaughter."}
