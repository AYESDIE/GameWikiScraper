On the &lt;a href=\"Calendar%20%28Daggerfall%29\"&gt;8th of Frostfall&lt;/a&gt; the Prince of the Ostracised Malacath may be summoned, if the Agent agrees to pay a summoner of either a &lt;a href=\"Witch%20Coven\"&gt;Witch Coven&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Mages%20Guild%20%28Daggerfall%29\"&gt;Mages Guild&lt;/a&gt;, or a &lt;a href=\"Temples%20%28Daggerfall%29\"&gt;Temple&lt;/a&gt;.\nWalkthrough.\nThe Agent may approach a summoner at either the Mages Guild, a Temple, or a Witch Coven to summon one of the Daedric Princes. If the summoning occurs on the 8th of Frostfall, the Agent may receive a vision of Malacath, whom immediately offers them a quest. Indeed, Malacath will offer to make the Agent \"strong and beautiful,\" if they accept the terms of their \"gift.\"\nThe Treacherous Seducer.\nAccepting Malacath's offer will reveal that \"a little panikosa\" or daedra seducer has betrayed him, and must be destroyed. This seducer has hidden herself in a dungeon to escape the Prince's attentions, but this should not cost the Agent too much time. Indeed, Malacath sets a hard deadline for the Agent to complete the quest and speak with their apostle in a regional palace to receive their reward, Malacath's \"prized\" &lt;a href=\"Volendrung%20%28Daggerfall%29\"&gt;Volendrung&lt;/a&gt;.\nWith that the Agent must head to the dungeon mentioned by Malacath and track down the seducer. There may be several other seducers roaming the halls of the dungeon, so the Agent will have to keep slaying the dungeon's inhabitants until they receive this notification:\n\"[Daedra Seducer's name] is dead.\"\"\nWith that, the Agent is free to head to the town mentioned by Malacath and meet with the Prince's apostle before the time limit expires to complete the quest. However, the Agent may find a note on the seducer's corpse, which adds an extra line of intrigue into the machinations of Malacath.\n(Optional) A Noble Informant.\nThe note the Agent may find on the seducer's corpse will reveal that the former seducer was involved in a successful plot to assassinate a noble. To investigate this matter the Agent must head to the palace in the town mentioned in the note and speak with the local ruler. This ruler is investigating the murder, and will gladly take the note stating:\n\"[Oath]! [Apostle's name) was behind [Victim's name]'s death? And involved in a daedra plot as well? We may never have solved this murder without your help, [Agent's name]. Your loyalty to the [region ruler's title] will not be forgotten.\"\"\nHowever, despite effectively turning in Malacath's apostle, the Agent will still be able to meet with them and receive their reward. Furthermore, the Agent will receive a bonus to their reputation within the region for turning in the apostle, as well as the standard boosts for completing a Daedric Prince's quest successfully.\nRewards.\nCompleting the quest successfully within the time limit will see the Agent rewarded with Volendrung by the Prince's apostle. The Agent will also receive a boost in reputation with the faction whom summoned the Prince for them, as well as the faction's associates. There will also be a &lt;a href=\"regions%20%28Daggerfall%29\"&gt;regional&lt;/a&gt; boost in reputation if the Agent turns in the note to the noble.\nConversely, failing the quest will result in the Agent losing reputation with the summoner's faction.\nThe changes made to reputation, either by successfully completing or failing the quest are shown below:\nFurther reputation bonuses are applied if the Agent also hands in the note to the local ruling noble:"}

Why this text was aboard one of the vessels, I cannot guess, but it appears to be the journal of a diplomat to &lt;a href=\"Thras\"&gt;Thras&lt;/a&gt; written before &lt;a href=\"1E%202260\"&gt;1E 2260&lt;/a&gt;. Though it is damaged, the descriptions of the &lt;a href=\"Sload\"&gt;Sload&lt;/a&gt; that remain legible are fascinating\u2014assuming this is not some strange work of fiction or forgery. If it is legitimate, it is a remarkable find, as the Sload were loath to treat with any of the races of &lt;a href=\"Tamriel\"&gt;Tamriel&lt;/a&gt;.\nWe know that the slug-folk of Thras practiced foul &lt;a href=\"necromancy\"&gt;necromancy&lt;/a&gt;, but their involvement with that dread art may have been more prominent than previously thought, if this is an authentic text. The author expresses frequent disgust at interacting with re-animated slaves. It seems the Sload also slaughtered and revived various sea creatures\u2014turtles, crabs, and the like\u2014to keep as pets. His repulsion did not end there, though, as he complained about the repugnant smell of the Sload, the several inches of slime-coated water upon the floors of any land-based building, and the various molds and fungi served as food.\nThere are mentions of elaborate sacrificial rituals, which I find unusual given their general rejection of worship. The Sload certainly entered pacts with the &lt;a href=\"Daedra\"&gt;Daedra&lt;/a&gt; when it suited them, but the ceremonies described here are not indicative of typical Daedric sacrifice. They may have spent years grooming individuals to participate in re-enactments of the deeds of Sload mythological heroes and villains, with the eventual performance (which may have lasted weeks) culminating in the deaths of every actor by the application of \u201cdesiccation crystals\" to the body. Ancestor worship? Unnamed deities? Preservation of ancient magics? It is impossible to tell.\nMore intriguing is a badly-damaged entry that discusses an audience in the submerged tower of an \u201cElder Distended One.\" I can make out little of the discussion between the two, but there are mentions of an \u201cimpressively corpulent body and strangely pulsating head,\" and three eyes that emerged upon its belly that each \u201copened again as a toothless mouth, disgorging [unreadable] that the attendants eagerly consumed.\" This is the first insight I have encountered into potential cultural leadership among the Sload.\nIt has caused me no end of frustration that the entries chronicling a visit to the \u201cMenagerie of Sublime Infection\" are nearly unreadable. Aside from the name, almost nothing of this section can be deciphered aside from several unnerving words implying all manner of affliction, from \u201csuppurating extrusions\" and \u201cblood-rot\" to \u201cfestering myiasis.\" Much about the &lt;a href=\"Thrassian%20Plague\"&gt;Thrassian Plague&lt;/a&gt; remains a mystery\u2014and perhaps one that is best left buried. I cannot, however, deny my interest in the whys and wherefores of the grotesque fascination with disease expressed here.\nNow that I have documented my own immediate reactions to this text, I must send it along to colleagues in &lt;a href=\"Alinor\"&gt;Alinor&lt;/a&gt; to hopefully verify its authenticity. Whether or not there is anything useful to be gained from it, at the very least it may add to our understanding of a terrible enemy to all the races of Tamriel in the unlikely event that such a threat re-emerges. If anything contained herein is factual, let us pray to &lt;a href=\"Auriel\"&gt;Auriel&lt;/a&gt; that it never does."}

My auntie left me a shack on a hill south of the border. Never thought about it much, until I lifted &lt;a href=\"Hrol%27s%20Golden%20Girdle\"&gt;Hrol's Golden Girdle&lt;/a&gt; from the &lt;a href=\"Temple%20of%20the%20One\"&gt;Temple of the One&lt;/a&gt;. Suddenly life got real complicated, and I decided it was time to go claim my inheritance.\nAuntie\u2014let's call her Auntie Alias, no point in telling you too much\u2014was an &lt;a href=\"Imperials%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Imperial&lt;/a&gt; Border Scout, part of the cohort stationed at &lt;a href=\"Fort%20Sphinxmoth%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Fort Sphinxmoth&lt;/a&gt;, in the hills between &lt;a href=\"Elsweyr%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Elsweyr&lt;/a&gt; and northern &lt;a href=\"Valenwood%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Valenwood&lt;/a&gt;. In the late days of the &lt;a href=\"Second%20Empire\"&gt;Second Empire&lt;/a&gt; the job of the Border Scouts was to keep the quarrelsome locals in line so as not to interfere with trade. \"Free trade, by Aless,\" auntie would say, opening another bottle of &lt;a href=\"Surilie%20Brothers%20Wine\"&gt;Surilie Farms&lt;/a&gt; and winking. \"Lifeblood of the Empire!\"\nNow the Scouts couldn't stop every little cross-border vendetta, but they did prevent the Cats and the Runty Elves from engaging in wholesale slaughter, and kept the bandits off the road from &lt;a href=\"Dune%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Dune&lt;/a&gt; to &lt;a href=\"Arenthia%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Arenthia&lt;/a&gt;. Auntie liked the climate, so when she retired she bought this little plot, came down and put up her hut. It's bigger than it looks, by the way\u2014goes way back into the hill, and you can bet auntie dug out a back door, just in case.By the time I got here, one dark night in &lt;a href=\"Sun%27s%20Dusk\"&gt;Sun's Dusk&lt;/a&gt;, with the wound in my thigh leaking blood again after that wild ride on the stolen horse, the Border Scouts were long gone, and the &lt;a href=\"Dawnmead%20Marches\"&gt;Dawnmead Marches&lt;/a&gt; had returned to their natural state: just one law shy of anarchy. And that one law was the Law of Revenge.\nIt was the &lt;a href=\"Vinedusk\"&gt;Vinedusk&lt;/a&gt; Wood Elf tribe versus the &lt;a href=\"Dakarn\"&gt;Dakarn&lt;/a&gt; Khajiiti clan, and it was a near-continual war of cross-border raids and midnight murders. They took turns occupying the ruins of Fort Sphinxmoth, sending out bands to waylay merchant caravans, raid villages and towns, and pay off old scores. Neither side noticed me hiding in the old shack during daylight, and slipping from shadow to shadow around the Marches after dark. The place was a killing ground\u2014I could hardly go five hundred paces without encountering a dead warrior, a half-empty cart, or a slain merchant.\nIt was a looter's paradise.\nAh, those were the good times. Too good to last, I suppose\u2014eventually the Vinedusk bandits overreached and staged a raid on Arenthia itself, right about the time the Dakarn Cats tried to take over organized crime in Dune and the &lt;a href=\"Thizzrini%20Arena\"&gt;Thizzrini Arena&lt;/a&gt;. The respectable citizens on both sides of the border formed militias or hired mercenaries, swept the hills clean, and that was the end of brigandry in the Marches. The Vinedusk tribe actually reformed as a &lt;a href=\"Bosmer%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Bosmeri&lt;/a&gt; irregular unit, the \"&lt;a href=\"Vinedusk%20Rangers\"&gt;Vinedusk Rangers&lt;/a&gt;\" (Ha!), while the surviving Dakarns became the nucleus of the &lt;a href=\"Duneguard%20Outwalkers\"&gt;Duneguard Outwalkers&lt;/a&gt;. The border settled back down, and the Lifeblood of the Empire resumed its flow.\nFortunately, I was there to recognize opportunity when I saw it coming down the road from Dune, laden with trade goods. By the next Fredas I was in &lt;a href=\"Bravil\"&gt;Bravil&lt;/a&gt;, looking up a few of my old contacts. Half a season later it was me and the newly-dubbed &lt;a href=\"Murkwater%20Gang\"&gt;Murkwater Gang&lt;/a&gt; who were occupying good old Fort Sphinxmoth, digging out the barracks, sharpening our blades, and repairing the old traps.\nThe good times are back."}

Depending on whether you speak to Sven or Faendal first, there will be several options to help either of the two men win over Camilla's affection, with each path having 3 possible solutions:\nHelping Faendal.\n\"1st Solution:\" Talking to Faendal before speaking with Sven will cause Faendal to give you a false letter, supposedly written by Sven, and he will request the Dragonborn to deliver this fake letter to Camilla. At this point, you lie to Camilla by saying the letter indeed came from Sven, which will cause her to become angry and ask the Dragonborn to go tell Sven never to speak to her again. Upon returning to Faendal, either at his house or near the lumbermill, he will reward the Dragonborn with 25 .\n\"2nd Solution:\" If you spoke to Sven first, he will be the one giving you the false letter, one supposedly written by Faendal this time instead. The second choice thus is to tell Camilla the truth that the letter was from Sven and not Faendal. She will be shocked and will ask the Dragonborn to speak to Faendal and tell him what just happened. By doing so, Faendal will reward the Dragonborn with 25 .\n\"3rd Solution:\" Lying about Faendal's letter that belittles Sven. The Dragonborn will receive the same reward.\nHelping Sven.\nThe same pattern as above applies here as well.\n\"1st Solution:\" Lie to Camilla by telling her that the letter came from Faendal. Sven will reward the Dragonborn with 25 .\n\"2nd Solution:\" Start the same way as Solution 1 under \"Helping Faendal\", but give Camilla the second letter. Since she doesn't know about the first letter, she will believe that Faendal is at fault. The outcome is the same as above.\n\"3rd Solution:\" Tell Camilla the truth about Faendal's false letter and him trying to incriminate Sven. The Dragonborn will receive the same reward.\nHelping yourself.\nBoth Faendal and Sven can be &lt;a href=\"pickpocket\"&gt;pickpocket&lt;/a&gt;ed for the letters, and both can be given to Camilla either via lying that each is from the other, or by telling the truth. She will offer no unique dialogue in either case. If lied to, she will now hate both men, and if told the truth about the letters, she will simply ask the Dragonborn to go talk to both men for defending their honors.\nEither way, the player will now be tasked with returning to both men.

Part of the &lt;a href=\"Staff%20of%20Chaos\"&gt;Staff of Chaos&lt;/a&gt; was recovered from the Labyrinthian, which became instrumental in the overthrow of &lt;a href=\"Jagar%20Tharn\"&gt;Jagar Tharn&lt;/a&gt;, ending the &lt;a href=\"Imperial%20Simulacrum\"&gt;Imperial Simulacrum&lt;/a&gt;. The site has since become embedded in the minds of all subjects of the &lt;a href=\"Empire\"&gt;Empire&lt;/a&gt;, and the ruins are occasionally visited by Loyalist pilgrims, re-tracing the steps of the &lt;a href=\"Eternal%20Champion\"&gt;Eternal Champion&lt;/a&gt;. The namesake of Labyrinthian is somewhat less commonly known, however.\nThe foreboding ruins were originally built as a temple to the &lt;a href=\"Dragons%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Dragon&lt;/a&gt;. This grew into &lt;a href=\"Bromjunaar\"&gt;Bromjunaar&lt;/a&gt;, a great city of that era. Bromjunaar is believed by some to have been the capital of &lt;a href=\"Skyrim\"&gt;Skyrim&lt;/a&gt; at the height of the &lt;a href=\"Dragon%20Cult\"&gt;Dragon Cult's&lt;/a&gt; influence there. Little historical record exists to verify or refute this, but it is known that the highest ranking Priests of the Cult met at Labyrinthian to discuss matters of ruling.\nBromjunaar crumbled, however, along with the rest of the Dragon Cult, and the site lay abandoned for many years, a deteriorating reminder of those benighted days for the &lt;a href=\"Nords\"&gt;Nords&lt;/a&gt;. Not until the days of &lt;a href=\"Shalidor\"&gt;Shalidor&lt;/a&gt; would the ruins come into use again.\nShalidor the &lt;a href=\"Archmage\"&gt;Archmage&lt;/a&gt; was famous for his exploits in the &lt;a href=\"First%20Era\"&gt;First Era&lt;/a&gt;. Various tales tell of him battling &lt;a href=\"Dwemer\"&gt;Dwemer&lt;/a&gt; legions single-handedly, building the city of &lt;a href=\"Winterhold%20%28Skyrim%20City%29\"&gt;Winterhold&lt;/a&gt; with a whispered spell, stealing the secret of life from &lt;a href=\"Akatosh\"&gt;Akatosh&lt;/a&gt;, or constructing Labyrinthian himself. While many Shalidor legends are hyperbole or outright fabrication, we can discover some truth behind his involvement with Labyrinthian.\nShalidor stood at the forefront of a movement to enact higher standards among mages, and to discourage spell-use among the common castes. This effort is dubiously credited with the original organization and formation of the schools of magic and the foundation of &lt;a href=\"College%20of%20Winterhold%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;College at Winterhold&lt;/a&gt;.\nConsistent with this mentality, Shalidor constructed his Labyrinth deep within the ruins of Bromjunaar to test new Archmages. While navigating the destroyed city itself was not explicitly a part of the test, many candidates did not survive the journey. Shalidor valued both academic knowledge as well as practical skill, and simply getting to the Labyrinth required the latter.\nShalidor's Labyrinthian is actually two intersecting mazes, in an hourglass pattern. One maze could no be competed without exiting the other first, which makes the only existing instruction for the test especially mysterious:\nEnter Twice - Exit Only Once\n&lt;a href=\"Alteration%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Alteration&lt;/a&gt; will lead you to &lt;a href=\"Destruction%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Destruction&lt;/a&gt;\nOnly &lt;a href=\"Illusion%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Illusion&lt;/a&gt; shows the way to &lt;a href=\"Restoration%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Restoration&lt;/a&gt;\n&lt;a href=\"Conjuration%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Conjure&lt;/a&gt; not, but be conjured instead.\nWe can only guess at what the solution to the test may have been as Labyrinthian became notorious not only for the number of potential archmages who died there, but for the intense secrecy of those who succeeded.\nLabyrinthian eventually ceased to be used, and is regarded as a symbol of a more brutal age by modern institutions for magical studies. The ruins lay empty again, overrun with wild animals avoided by travelers. The long history and legacy of this place, however, seems as likely to be erased from our minds as the ruins themselves are likely to sink into the sea."}

But his brothers didn't like that so they bound him in the vault so he couldn't participate, and never returned.\nHe's glad to hear the Alessians lost the war, but can the Vestige release him? They need to destroy three relics that bind him - the Seal of Anchoring, the Animus Needle, and the Sould Prison.\nFollow the markers to find the three relics and destroy them, then return to the ghost and talk to him again. He is happy and can already feel the grip of those accursed anchors releasing him. After all this time he is finally free. He doesn't know what to do now, maybe move on to Aetherius or remain in &lt;a href=\"Tamriel\"&gt;Tamriel&lt;/a&gt;. The Vestige can give him one advice and whatever is chosen, the ghost also gives an advice in return that not everything one meets in an ancient ruin shall be as cordial as he has."}

He owed a money lender named Mogrul 1000 septims. Now Mogrul expects me to pay Drovas' debt. If I don't, he's going to keep sending thugs after me.\"\"\nWalkthrough.\nAfter completing \"&lt;a href=\"Reluctant%20Steward\"&gt;Reluctant Steward&lt;/a&gt;,\" if Mogrul, the loan shark in Raven Rock, is approached, he will\u00a0state that Drovas Relvi was in debt to him. As\u00a0Drovas is now &lt;a href=\"Neloth%20%28Dragonborn%29\"&gt;Neloth's&lt;/a&gt; steward and thus, under Neloth's protection, he is untouchable. Mogrul states that the Dragonborn is responsible for the debt and demands payment. Refuse and Mogrul will keep sending &lt;a href=\"Mogrul%27s%20Thug\"&gt;thugs&lt;/a&gt;\u00a0to collect the payment until the quest is completed. The options are to either pay the debt or kill him. If paying, he may also be intimidated into cutting the debt in half.\n\"It seems you've inherited a problem.\"\nIf choosing to kill Mogrul, it can be easily accomplished by luring him out of Raven Rock (as he will immediately begin approaching upon arrival) and slaying him out of sight of the guards and townsfolk. Alternatively, Mogrul will be relatively isolated in &lt;a href=\"the%20Retching%20Netch\"&gt;the Retching Netch&lt;/a&gt; from approximately 12:00am to 3:00am in-game time. The bartender &lt;a href=\"Geldis%20Sadri\"&gt;Geldis Sadri&lt;/a&gt;'s location prevents him from being counted as a witness. If \"&lt;a href=\"Unearthed%20%28Dragonborn%29\"&gt;Unearthed&lt;/a&gt;\" has been completed and &lt;a href=\"Teldryn%20Sero\"&gt;Teldryn Sero&lt;/a&gt; has been hired as a follower, both Teldryn and &lt;a href=\"Ralis%20Sedarys\"&gt;Ralis Sedarys&lt;/a&gt; will assist the Dragonborn. During this time, he may be found sleeping alone in his room, which is the second door following an immediate right at the bottom of the stairs. Picking the lock in stealth, going in, closing the door and killing him in his sleep incurs neither bounty nor attacks from Slitter.\nHowever, if Mogrul is not found sleeping in his room and it is impossible to assassinate him without incurring a bounty, one can use &lt;a href=\"Nightingale%20Subterfuge\"&gt;Nightingale Subterfuge&lt;/a&gt;, a power obtained during the &lt;a href=\"Thieves%20Guild%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Thieves Guild&lt;/a&gt; questline. Casting it while he, among others, is in its area of effect will result in them fighting, likely leading to Mogrul's death.\nThe Dragonborn can also speak to Relvi and inquire about the debt:\nDo you owe Mogrul money? \"Uh... Well, sort of. I owed him a thousand septims, but not any more. He doesn't dare try to collect now that I'm Neloth's steward.\""}

These brave men and women have, for countless years, always been available to do those jobs that the average citizen is simply not qualified to handle. Whether it be ridding a homeowner of a plague of rats or rescuing a wayward scholar, the Fighters Guild has always been available for anyone with enough coin to pay their modest fees. Now, however, it seems that the Fighters Guild is not the only game in town.\nA new group has recently been making a lot of waves in &lt;a href=\"Cyrodiil\"&gt;Cyrodiil&lt;/a&gt;. They call themselves the &lt;a href=\"Blackwood%20Company\"&gt;Blackwood Company&lt;/a&gt;, and they've let it be known that they'll handle any job that the Fighters Guild will, and many that they won't.\nWhile the Fighters Guild has always maintained the strictest standards on both the quality of their members and the legality of the contracts they accept, the Blackwood Company makes none of the same claims. They have no screening process when accepting new members, and they seem willing to accept any contract, assuming one can afford the price tag.\nSome have questioned the Blackwood Company's methods. They are rumored to be reckless and indiscriminant. Many have spoken of needless damage to person and property during the fulfillment of a contract. None of those we spoke to were willing to go on the record for this article.\nWhat the future holds for this upstart group remains to be seen. Are they the perfect solution for a quickly changing world? Will their methods force the Fighters Guild to adopt more lenient business practices? Only time will tell. Until then, if you need a job done, and the Fighters Guild won't do it, check with your local Blackwood Company!"}

Alternatively, any Dwemer gyro collected prior to meeting her will suffice. With a high enough &lt;a href=\"Speech\"&gt;Speech&lt;/a&gt; level, she can also be persuaded to go immediately to Fort Dawnguard.\nReturn.\nAfter arriving at Fort Dawnguard, Isran tests both newcomers for vampirism by shining a beam of sunlight into the center of the entrance hall.\nGunmar: \"All right Isran, you've got us all here.

I'm sure you've heard a bit of what we're up against. Powerful vampires, unlike anything we've seen before. And they have an Elder Scroll. If anyone is going to stand in their way, it's going to be us.\"\nSorine: \"This is all well and good, but do we actually know anything about what they're doing? What do we do now?\"\nIsran: \"We'll get to that. For now, get acquainted with the space. Sorine, you'll find room to start your tinkering on that crossbow design you've been working on. Gunmar, there's an area large enough for you to pen up some trolls, get them armored up and ready for use. In the meantime, we're going to get to the bottom of why a vampire showed up here looking for you. Let's go have a little chat with it, shall we?\"\nIf the Dragonborn is a vampire, he won't grant membership until the vampirism has been cured and will suggest that &lt;a href=\"Falion%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Falion&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Morthal%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Morthal&lt;/a&gt; is visited.

He will then summon the Dragonborn upstairs. The quest completes and the next quest, \"&lt;a href=\"Prophet%20%28Dawnguard%29\"&gt;Prophet&lt;/a&gt;,\" begins. The next time the interior of Fort Dawnguard is visited, Sorine and Gunmar will have changed into Dawnguard armor and opened up their shops as the general goods and blacksmith merchants, respectively.

In the basement's southeast corner, Baldor Iron-Shaper can be found lying in pain against a wall. He will explain that the Thalmor were trying to force him to reveal the secrets of the art of Stalhrim smithing, and that their leader had &lt;a href=\"Stalhrim%20Source%20Map\"&gt;a map&lt;/a&gt; which shows the location of a hidden source of Stalhrim.

You're the one who freed the Skaal from the dark spell. Thank the All-Maker that you have come.

The first entered upon reaching that level will be where he spawns. He offers the Dragonborn a chance to join a drinking contest and win a staff.\n\"You look like someone who can hold their liquor. How about a friendly contest to win a staff?\"\nAfter three drinks the &lt;a href=\"Last%20Dragonborn\"&gt;Dragonborn&lt;/a&gt; will be rendered unconscious and subsequently awaken in the Temple of Dibella in &lt;a href=\"Markarth%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Markarth&lt;/a&gt;, which is now trashed.\nTemple of Dibella.\nThe priestess &lt;a href=\"Senna\"&gt;Senna&lt;/a&gt; tasks the Dragonborn with picking up several seemingly meaningless items, including a &lt;a href=\"Giant%27s%20Toe\"&gt;giant's toe&lt;/a&gt;, two bottles of &lt;a href=\"alto%20wine\"&gt;alto wine&lt;/a&gt;, a &lt;a href=\"Hagraven%20Feathers\"&gt;Hagraven feather&lt;/a&gt;, and a &lt;a href=\"Repair%20Supplies\"&gt;confusing note&lt;/a&gt; from Sam.

This will be the case at each step of the quest, allowing you to skip any errands in order to win people's favor. After the temple is clean and the Dragonborn apologizes to her, the priestess will mention Rorikstead.\n\"Wake up! That's right, it's time to wake up, you drunken blasphemer!\"\nRorikstead.\nUpon arrival, an angry &lt;a href=\"Redguards%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Redguard&lt;/a&gt; named &lt;a href=\"Ennis%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Ennis&lt;/a&gt; will rebuke the Dragonborn, claiming that the night prior, the Dragonborn had seized his goat &lt;a href=\"Gleda%20the%20Goat\"&gt;Gleda&lt;/a&gt; and sold it to a &lt;a href=\"Giant%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;giant&lt;/a&gt; named &lt;a href=\"Grok\"&gt;Grok&lt;/a&gt;. Retrieving the goat can be skipped if a persuasion, intimidate or bribe challenge is passed.\n\"You! You've got a lot of nerve showing yourself in this town again. What do you have to say for yourself?\"\nIt is also possible to retrieve the goat simply by approaching it and leading it back to the hamlet. If there is a &lt;a href=\"Followers%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;follower&lt;/a&gt; present, they will attack the offended giant and the latter might have to be killed to save the follower, unless the character accompanying the Dragonborn is essential. Once one of these requirements is met, Ennis will point the Dragonborn to Whiterun and Ysolda.\nHere's your goat. Now can you help me retrace my steps? \"\"Gleda! And not a scratch on her! Happy day! I still can't figure out why you stole her. You left a note explaining it, but half of it was gibberish and the rest had mead spilled on it. Only bit I could make out was \"repaying Ysolda in Whiterun,\" and even that's mostly scribbles. Guess you could try there.\"\"\nWhiterun.\nUpon finding Ysolda\u00a0in Whiterun (or in the Dragonborn's house, if they are &lt;a href=\"Marriage%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;married&lt;/a&gt; to her),\u00a0she will mention the price owed to her for a purchase of a &lt;a href=\"Wedding%20Ring\"&gt;wedding ring&lt;/a&gt;. She also mentions that\u00a0the Dragonborn's spouse-to-be was met in\u00a0&lt;a href=\"Witchmist%20Grove\"&gt;Witchmist Grove&lt;/a&gt;, and\u00a0the wedding was called off.\n\"So, you're finally back. Look, I've been patient, but you still owe me.\"\nFinding the ring can again be skipped if the Dragonborn passes a persuasion, intimidate, or bribe challenge. If the Dragonborn elects not to skip this, however, in Witchmist Grove, located just south of &lt;a href=\"Kynesgrove%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Kynesgrove&lt;/a&gt;, the Dragonborn finds a &lt;a href=\"Hagraven%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Hagraven&lt;/a&gt; named &lt;a href=\"Moira\"&gt;Moira&lt;/a&gt;. She will become jealous of an Esmerelda that has \"dark feathers\" and attack.\n\"Darling! I've been waiting for you to return, to consummate our love!\"\nEither way, when talking to Ysolda again, she mentions the Dragonborn getting married to someone in Morvunskar.\nHere's the ring. \"Excellent! Sorry it didn't work out with you and your lady. I know how excited you were for the wedding. You kept saying it would be a huge ceremony at Morvunskar. You said you even had some magic staff that that would handle all the guests.\"\nMorvunskar.\nMorvunskar is a ruined fort, now inhabited by hostile mages. Within the ruin is the entrance to &lt;a href=\"Misty%20Grove\"&gt;Misty Grove&lt;/a&gt;, occupied by Sam and several dinner guests, just labeled \"Commoners.\" When conversation is initiated with Sam Guevenne, he suddenly undergoes a dramatic transformation without warning, revealing that he is, in fact, the &lt;a href=\"Daedric%20prince\"&gt;Daedric prince&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Sanguine\"&gt;Sanguine&lt;/a&gt;, whose sphere is hedonism, debauchery, and drunken revelry. He presents the Dragonborn with his &lt;a href=\"Daedric%20Artifacts%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Daedric Artifact&lt;/a&gt;\u2014the &lt;a href=\"Sanguine%20Rose%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Sanguine Rose&lt;/a&gt;.\n\"You're here! I was beginning to think you might not make it.\"\nThe Dragonborn is then teleported back to the tavern where Sam was first encountered. Any items collected in the temple will no longer be marked as quest items, allowing them to be dropped or used like normal."}

Guildmagisters will therefore begin to offer the Agent more difficult tasks, rewarding them with and a boost to their reputation, meaning they can climb further through the Guild's ranks.\nWalkthrough.\nWhen speaking with one of the Guildmagisters from the Mages Guild, the Agent will be handed a &lt;a href=\"Letter%20from%20the%20Acolyte\"&gt;letter&lt;/a&gt;, addressed directly to them. The letter reveals that an Acolyte requests their assistance in an urgent matter, one which he will elaborate on once the Agent visits them in a temple. There, they reveal that the Noble must be saved for the good of the &lt;a href=\"Regions%20%28Daggerfall%29\"&gt;region&lt;/a&gt;, but needs some persuading to go into hiding.\nThe Fate of a Noble.\nThe Acolyte reveals that her mistress, an Oracle, has promised to come to speak with the Noble about their \"dream,\" but has yet to arrive. The Acolyte also suggests that the Agent speak to the Noble themself, a conversation which will see the Noble reveal that they will \"not abandon [their] love,\" whom has been taken into a dungeon. The Agent therefore has two methods to complete the quest: Escort the Oracle, or save the Noble's lover.\nThe Calm of Wisdom.\nThe simple of the two options is to find the Oracle, whom can be found in a town elsewhere in the region. A brief search of the town and the Oracle can be found in the local Temple, and will instantly recognise the Agent, stating:\nThe Agent must safely escort the Oracle to the Noble, whom will be convinced to go into hiding once the Oracle speaks with them. The Noble will instantly disappear into hiding, meaning the Agent will have forfeited a reward.\nA Lover's Comfort.\nTo rescue the Noble's lover, the Agent will have to enter the dungeon identified by the Noble. Inside, the Agent will have to fight a random assortment of &lt;a href=\"Creatures%20%28Daggerfall%29\"&gt;creatures&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Enemies%20%28Daggerfall%29\"&gt;enemies&lt;/a&gt;, before finding the lover hiding somewhere within. Upon being found the lover will state:\nThe Agent must now escort the lover from the dungeon to the Noble, where the Lover will persuade the Noble to go into exile. Before they disappear, the Agent will receive a random amount of for rescuing his lover, completing the quest.\nRewards.\nThe Agent will receive a random amount of from the Noble if their lover persuaded them to go into hiding, alongside the boost to their &lt;a href=\"reputation%20%28Daggerfall%29\"&gt;reputation&lt;/a&gt; within the Guild. The penalties for failing the quest are relatively high by comparison, but will also see gains among some anti-Mage Guild factions:\nShould the Oracle, rather than the Agent, persuade the Noble to go into hiding then the Agent will receive an additional reputation boost:"}

This creates furrows for our &lt;a href=\"saltrice\"&gt;saltrice&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"marshmerrow\"&gt;marshmerrow&lt;/a&gt;, and other needed crops. Many of our livelihoods depend on the quick growth and trade of these items. But what is the true cost of these goods?\nThe nix-ox is not a beast of steel as the &lt;a href=\"Dwemer\"&gt;Dwarves&lt;/a&gt; once created, but a living, breathing animal. Over years of dedicated service, the nix-ox pedipalps begin to erode. Not only do they lose this important form of protection, they are then deemed useless by our \"good neighbor\" the farmer. They're left to starve in the ash wastes, or butchered for their &lt;a href=\"carapace\"&gt;carapace&lt;/a&gt;s. What a fine way to thank the being who put so many years of dedication into the very soil of &lt;a href=\"Vvardenfell%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Vvardenfell&lt;/a&gt;!\n\"But what can we do?\" you may be asking. \"Is there a better way?\" Fellow Housefolk, of course there is. There's always a better way.\nI believe that the law should require all farmers to retire nix-oxen after a certain amount of years of service. They then should be allowed a peaceful retirement, still given food and care by those who they have peacefully collaborated with throughout the years. They deserve all of the tasty mushrooms they can get their mandibles on, and peace and comfort in their twilight years.\nTo make this vision possible I propose a public mandate, a petition to protect our gentle giant friends. All you need to do is show your support. Will you join me, House Dunmer?"}

Juranda-ra asked me to help deal with the infestation.\"\"\nDetailed walkthrough.\nJuranda-ra, the Clan-Mother of the &lt;a href=\"Laughing%20Moons%20Plantation\"&gt;Laughing Moons Plantation&lt;/a&gt;, expresses dismay at an upcoming inspection by the &lt;a href=\"Second%20Aldmeri%20Dominion\"&gt;Aldmeri Dominion&lt;/a&gt;, requested by &lt;a href=\"Harrani\"&gt;Headwoman Harrani&lt;/a&gt;. After spoken to, she will reveal that rats have infested the plantation; she is worried that the inspector will see the infestation and be skeptical that the workers can protect their crops from thieves:\n\"\"First the hurricane, then &lt;a href=\"Rat%20%28Online%29\"&gt;rats&lt;/a&gt; from the sea. What next, flying &lt;a href=\"Mudcrab%20%28Online%29\"&gt;mudcrabs&lt;/a&gt;? &lt;a href=\"S%27rendarr\"&gt;S'rendarr&lt;/a&gt;'s mercy, we need more time before the inspection!\"\nShe will ask the Vestige to speak to Cinder-Tail to find out why his &lt;a href=\"Senche-Tiger%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Senche-Tigers&lt;/a&gt; are not getting rid of the rat infestation at the plantation. He can be found in the farthest house from Juranda-ra in the row, where he is complaining to his tigers:\n\"Want to buy a carpet? How about three? They aren't good for much else. Yes, Afeh, even you!\"\nBecause the rats that the Senche-Tigers were eating had consumed moon sugar, the senche have become too tired to do anything. Upon further discussion, however, Cinder-Tail comes up with an idea. He asks the Vestige to go find some &lt;a href=\"Thunderbug\"&gt;Thunderbug&lt;/a&gt; eggs and smash them on the rat nests, making the Thunderbugs destroy the nests and kill the rats.\nObtaining the eggs.\nThere are four nests that can be visited nearby: one next to the senche-tiger house and Cinder-Tail, one behind &lt;a href=\"Moonmirth%20House\"&gt;Moonmirth House&lt;/a&gt;, and two near the path to the &lt;a href=\"Temple%20of%20Two-Moons%20Dance\"&gt;Temple of Two-Moons Dance&lt;/a&gt;. It is worthy of note that only one site must be visited; in addition, some nests have more than one Thunderbug, while others do not, so if one wishes to avoid combat, they can find the easiest nest to attack and obtain the eggs. \nAfter getting the eggs, the &lt;a href=\"Vestige\"&gt;Vestige&lt;/a&gt; must throw them on the rat nests to get the Thunderbugs to destroy them. There are five spots in total to address: one next to Moonmirth house and &lt;a href=\"Radusha\"&gt;Radusha&lt;/a&gt;, one close to Juranda-ra and &lt;a href=\"Filadi\"&gt;Filadi&lt;/a&gt;, one just north of &lt;a href=\"Mirani\"&gt;Mirani&lt;/a&gt;, one next to &lt;a href=\"Nulla\"&gt;Nulla&lt;/a&gt;, and one in the field directly in front of &lt;a href=\"Baizad\"&gt;Baizad&lt;/a&gt;. Upon throwing the egg, a Thunderbug will temporarily appear near each area and blast the rat nest with lightning as rats run out of it in a panic. After doing so, the Thunderbug will disappear.\nTarma's arrival.\nDuring this step, &lt;a href=\"Inspector%20Tarma\"&gt;Inspector Tarma&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Haldoril\"&gt;Haldoril&lt;/a&gt; will appear and speak to Juranda-ra. If spoken to, Juranda-ra will refer to the Vestige as a \"specialist,\" and will infer that they continue the quest quickly, although no time limit exists.\nAfter all five nests have been destroyed, the Vesitge then returns to Juranda-ra.\n\"\"Clever, luring &lt;a href=\"thunderbug\"&gt;thunderbug&lt;/a&gt;s out of their mounds like that. A scheme worthy of &lt;a href=\"Baan%20Dar\"&gt;Baan Dar&lt;/a&gt;, himself! They're all gone, then?\"\"\nShe rewards them with the &lt;a href=\"Ratsplatter\"&gt;Ratsplatter&lt;/a&gt; and a leveled amount of gold. "}

I don't know how long the barricade will hold and I want to finish this and hide it before they find me.\nSo, how did this all begin? As with most falls, we were betrayed. It was &lt;a href=\"Jonathan%20Telwin\"&gt;Jonathan Telwin&lt;/a&gt;, my one-time friend and companion, who had sworn himself to the service of &lt;a href=\"Angof%20the%20Gravesinger%20%28Character%29\"&gt;Angof&lt;/a&gt; and the undead monster called Faolchu. Jonathan confided in me. He asked me to join his cause. I dismissed him, thinking this was just another of his many pranks. I was wrong.\nFaolchu made Jonathan a shifter, and the first wolf to breach our gates strolled in as though he belonged here. And we let him in, because he did. Once inside, Jonathan spread &lt;a href=\"Faolchu\"&gt;Faolchu&lt;/a&gt;'s curse (he called it a gift) throughout the city. The cursed would meet at night, while the city slept, and we mistook the howls in the dark for wild dogs.\nAs the numbers of the cursed grew, they opened the gates and let Faolchu and the rest of his mad pack into the city. That was a few hours ago, just after night fell. They ripped apart anyone who tried to oppose them. The blood\u2014there was so much blood! Those they didn't kill they \u2026 changed. I watched as my friends and neighbors transformed into wolves. Their screams were a mix of agony and ecstasy, and some dark part of me longed to join them. But I put such thoughts aside and got my family to safety.\nWe never would have made it if not for the &lt;a href=\"Camlorn%20Guard\"&gt;Camlorn Guard&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href=\"Darien%20Gautier\"&gt;Captain Darien&lt;/a&gt; and a small number of guards attacked the werewolves and defended us as we made our escape. I must say, Captain Darien was magnificent. He seemed immune to each attack, dodging and blocking and laughing as though he was thoroughly enjoying himself. He cleared a path to a house and shouted for a group of civilians to get inside and barricade the doors and windows. We were one of those groups.\nI don't know what happened to the Captain and his guards, but I thank them for helping us. I can smell fires now. I think the wolves intend to burn us out.\nLet me end this letter by saying that Jonathan Telwin is a coward. He took the easy way out and convinced a certain number of people to join him. I can't forgive the massacre that he took part in. If you're reading this, please, avenge Camlorn. Put an end to Faolchu and his foul creatures. Don't let this injustice go unanswered."}

Guildmagisters will therefore begin to offer the Agent more difficult tasks, rewarding them with and a boost to their reputation, meaning they can climb further through the Guild's ranks.\nWalkthrough.\nHaving spent some time working for the Mages Guild, the Agent will be offered the chance to assist some research. The researcher in question is one of the Guildmagister]s, who will ask that the Agent obtain an instrument that has long since disappeared from the Guild. The Guildmagister suggests two methods to find the instrument, one using a catalogue, the other through speaking with a scholar researching the item.\nThe Catalogued Quest.\nShould the Agent choose to use the Catalogue, they will have to enter the dungeon where the Guildmagister originally found a reference to the artefact. The Agent must search through the specified dungeon to find the catalogue, found lying on the floor somewhere inside, although the Agent will face a random assortment of &lt;a href=\"Creatures%20%28Daggerfall%29\"&gt;creatures&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Enemies%20%28Daggerfall%29\"&gt;enemies&lt;/a&gt;. Upon picking up the Catalogue, the Agent will instantly be offered another pair of paths to complete the quest, depending on its contents.\nA Museum Piece.\nThe more preferable of the two potential paths will be seen in the Catalogue, for it identifies where the instrument was originally from. The Agent will therefore have to delve into a second dungeon to retrieve it, fighting another set of dungeon dangers, before finding the item lying on the floor somewhere within. Confirmation that the Agent has found the item comes via a notification.\nWith that, the Agent may return to the Guildmagister, before the time limit expires, to complete the quest.\nDeep Storage.\nThe more hindering revelation from the Catalogue will be the fact that the piece has been catalogued, but its last known location has not been recorded. Without any further information, the Agent has a choice to make: Either give up and fail the quest, or track down the scholar mentioned by the Guildmagister.\nThe Researcher's Path.\nShould the Agent decided to visit the scholar, either from their conversation with the Guildmagister or finding the Catalogue, then they will have to dive into a separate dungeon. Another search is required before the Agent finds the scholar, who will be standing inside and ignored by the many creatures inhabiting the dungeon. When spoken to, the Agent will once again be presented with two paths, one vastly more complicated than the other.\nA Well Researched Artefact.\nSpeaking with the scholar reveals that they have known about the location of the artefact for some time, a fact quickly proved by a quick read through their notes. They will give the Agent the location of the artefact, meaning the Agent will have to head to a second dungeon (or third if they tried the Catalogue option) to retrieve it. There will be a random assortment of creatures and enemies in the artefact dungeon, which will be lying somewhere within.\nOnce the artefact has been recovered, the Agent may return to the Guildmagister, before the time limit expires, to complete the quest.\nThe Shopping List.\nThe alternative scenario will see the scholar state that they simply do not know where the item is, although they will instead offer the Agent a simple task. The rather innoculous errand will see the Agent handed a &lt;a href=\"A%20Scholar%27s%20List\"&gt;list&lt;/a&gt; of ingredients, which are to be obtained by a specific alchemist. All the Agent has to do is head to the alchemist, who will state:\nReturning with the lone ingredient to the scholar will see the Agent rewarded with a random &lt;a href=\"Enchantments%20%28Daggerfall%29\"&gt;magical&lt;/a&gt; item by the scholar. They will also reveal that they know the location of the Catalogue, and will offer to teleport the Agent to it. If the Agent has not gone to the Catalogue dungeon then this is the only way of potentially finding the artefact, otherwise the quest is over.\nIt should be noted that rejecting the offer to pick up ingredients for the scholar means that Agent will have to either find the Catalogue or fail the quest.\nA Dead End.\nThere is a one in four chance that the Agent's search is incompleteable, as neither Catalogue nor scholar know the location of the item. This will not be grounds for failure, however, as the Guildmagister will still reward the Agent for their efforts.\nRewards.\nThe Agent will receive a random amount of for completing the quest successfully, although there will be no major benefits to their &lt;a href=\"Reputation%20%28Daggerfall%29\"&gt;reputation&lt;/a&gt; regardless of which successful outcome occurs. The penalties for failing the quest are relatively high by comparison, but will also see gains among some anti-Mage Guild factions:"}

If you do this, .\nWhen you go looking for Ulghesh in his tent, you will find not Ulghesh but Ushruka there. She will tell you that she disguised herself as Ulghesh so hat she could return to Shatul and become its chief. She will tell you to return to Yazara to inform her of Ushruka's intentions. When you talk to Yazara, you can either tell her the truth or you can tell her that \"Ulghesh\" is on his way to the duel. If you tell her the truth, she will voice her disapproval of both candidates, and will ask you to replace one of their swords with a weakened blade. You cannot refuse to tamper in the duel in this way. The duel will take place in the &lt;a href=\"Bloody%20Knoll\"&gt;Bloody Knoll&lt;/a&gt; northeast of town; the swords will be in the weapon racks on both sides of the first room. After this, hide on the platform overlooking the arena, and the fight will commence. The person whose sword you replaced will lose the duel. \nAfter the duel, return to Yazara to finish the quest."}

In her cellar, there is a starving &lt;a href=\"Mountain%20Lion%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;mountain lion&lt;/a&gt; killing the rats, which got into the house through a hole in the wall. Note that if all the rats in the basement are killed by the mountain lions during either the first or second venture into the basement, the quest fails.\nOnce the lion is dead, Arvena will send the Hero to &lt;a href=\"Pinarus%20Inventius\"&gt;Pinarus Inventius&lt;/a&gt;, a hunter. Pinarus will mention that it is odd for lions to be in this area, and will lead the Hero outside of the city to find and kill all the mountain lions near the city.

Once they are dead the Hero will return to Arvena again, who will berate them and say there is a second lion in the basement attacking her rats.\nAfter killing the second lion, Arvena reveals that she thinks that her neighbor, the &lt;a href=\"Argonians%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;Argonian&lt;/a&gt; named &lt;a href=\"Quill-Weave\"&gt;Quill-Weave&lt;/a&gt;, who never liked her or her rats, is responsible for leading the mountain lions to her basement. Waiting behind Arvena's house or following Quill-Weave will prove that she is placing raw meat near the hole into Arvena's basement.\nConfronting Quill-Weave with proof will cause her to confess. She says she never wanted to harm Arvena, she just wanted the rats to come out of the cellar so the guards would take care of them. She will ask that the Hero not tell anybody, and that she will reward them in return.\nTelling Arvena the truth will cause her to be overjoyed and she will teach the hero one point of &lt;a href=\"Speechcraft%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;Speechcraft&lt;/a&gt; skill for free.

And what right have you to look upon &lt;a href=\"The%20Reach%20%28Online%29\"&gt;the Reach&lt;/a&gt;? It is a land that knows to whom it belongs and devours anyone who lays false claim upon it. But if you wish to see what land molded my uncle into a freeman above all others, then I will give you guidance so you may kneel and give thanks for the mercy he has granted you all in his rightful conquest.\nFirst, you would do well to visit the spirit shrines and make offerings to those whose lands you now tread upon, for you will find no mercy from &lt;a href=\"the%20Divines\"&gt;the Divines&lt;/a&gt; in the Reach. Before that, you will need to beg the forgiveness of its people you have tread upon, lest they cast you down like those who came before. If you appease the clans and spirits to gain fair passage, then you may yet survive this journey.\nTake respite in the village of &lt;a href=\"Karthwasten%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Karthwasten&lt;/a&gt;, where you may find folk who are willing to trade with an interloper rather than take insult at your trespass. Though it be best if you bring goods for barter, the locals will honor our empire's gold in trade, so give your thanks to the Emperor for that mercy as you exchange useless coin for the fruits of &lt;a href=\"Reachfolk\"&gt;Reachfolk&lt;/a&gt; labor.\nFarther west you'll find what remains of the domain of the &lt;a href=\"Dwemer\"&gt;Deep Folk&lt;/a&gt;, who thought to master the wild as they had the stone were instead swallowed up. The City of Stone, &lt;a href=\"Markarth%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Markarth&lt;/a&gt;, stands hollow and lifeless as birds' bones. Many in the Reach chose not to invite the ire of the spirits by dwelling in the enslaved stone, but those who fancy such trinkets will find no shortage of Dwarf baubles there and in the ruins north whose name I will not speak.\nTo the south, you'll find the stone scars that &lt;a href=\"Nords%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Nords&lt;/a&gt; cut into our lands as crumbling reminders of their failure to tame it. The ruins of &lt;a href=\"Briar%20Rock\"&gt;Briar Rock&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Lost%20Valley%20Redoubt%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Lost Valley&lt;/a&gt; now only offer shelter to the rightful rules of the Reach, and you would do well to avoid such places as the clans who claim them will defend their holdings fiercely. While you are there, you may count their foolish dead, piled like cord wood in the barrow, &lt;a href=\"Valthume%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Valthume&lt;/a&gt;, because even Reach dirt would not give Nord bones a home.\nNow, if you've gained an appreciation for the land that will not be tamed and haven't run screaming back to the safety of the Empire, then you will find a hearty land that will make a survivor out of you\u2014or a meal. Walk the untrod paths, feel the land with your bare feet, and keep a keen ear out for what the spirits seek in the rustle of the leaves. When you've spent a month without the comforts you are accustomed to, then, maybe, you'll be worthy of returning to them."}

Her attempts to elevate the other races and put them on equal footing with the &lt;a href=\"Altmer%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Altmer&lt;/a&gt; is simply unnatural. Everyone knows the value of High Elven supremacy, so why try to weaken it with these impure and totally unwarranted decrees? Let it be known that the people of Shimmerene and their Kinlady shall endeavor to do everything in our power to oppose this unreasonable and ultimately dangerous decree.\nWhy do I reject an end to the pristine nature of Summerset? Why, because of logic, of course! It is a well-documented fact that the Altmer are superior in every way to the lesser races that share our world. After all, who else can trace their lineage directly to the &lt;a href=\"Aedra\"&gt;Aedra&lt;/a&gt;? We proudly proclaim our divine heritage. Unlike the other races, we are not the creations of the gods, we are their descendants. Our genetic lineage can be traced to the original &lt;a href=\"Aldmer\"&gt;Aldmer&lt;/a&gt; race, through the &lt;a href=\"Ehlnofey\"&gt;Ehlnofey&lt;/a&gt; to the divine &lt;a href=\"et%27Ada\"&gt;et'Ada&lt;/a&gt; themselves. For this reason and this reason alone, we should be permitted to preserve our pure bloodlines and maintain the sanctity of our perfect island home.\nShould the Adventurous Queen desire more proof, we need only look to our stature, our golden hue, and our natural inclination toward &lt;a href=\"magic\"&gt;magic&lt;/a&gt;. The other races cannot compete with us in intellectual pursuits. They just aren't equipped for such a battle. Ours is the first true culture of &lt;a href=\"Tamriel\"&gt;Tamriel&lt;/a&gt; and we remained the most civilized of all the races. This fact cannot be refuted. We provided the basis for religion, language, and even architecture, and our influence can be seen across the continent. For all that we have provided, we should be allowed to keep a small piece of the world as solely our own.\nBeyond these self-evident truths, we must consider the poor lesser races as well. How cruel it will be to subject them to the rigors and requirements of our exacting culture and societal mores. They simply aren't equipped to handle the &lt;a href=\"Alaxon\"&gt;precision&lt;/a&gt; our customs and traditions demand. Should we embarrass them for these failings? Or worse yet, should amplify their deficiencies by setting a lesser standard for them to adhere to? They would call us cruel, and rightly so. Let us keep the metaphorical gates closed, and then neither side will suffer any sorrow or discomfort. Allowing the lesser races to migrate to &lt;a href=\"Summerset%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Summerset&lt;/a&gt; doesn't do them any favors. Quite the opposite, it will ultimately hurt them in the end.\nKeep Summerset pure. Keep Summerset pristine. Keep Summerset for the Altmer. Anything else makes no sense whatsoever."}

I admit that I am a licensed &lt;a href=\"Enchanting%20%28Online%29\"&gt;enchanter&lt;/a&gt; residing inside the &lt;a href=\"Imperial%20City%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Imperial City&lt;/a&gt;. But circumstances have changed, and now just a drain on my income.\nA few years ago, enchanters would take the physical object to be enchanted and, using various ingredients and tools, imbue the object with the necessary mystical powers. Because of this, enchanters only competed with other enchanters who resided in the same city, since most people did not want to carry a sword hundreds of leagues to another enchanter just to save a few gold drakes. Prices for the city could be set at a friendly meeting of three of four enchanters, and a fine profit could be made. As the right of the crown, a hefty levy for allowing us to operate in the city could be asserted.\nBut now this has all changed. Enchanters now just make a glyph with the desired effect trapped within it. A glyph is just a simple gem that anyone can attach to the pommel of a sword or on a piece of armor. Once attached the magic in the glyph then flows into the item.\nSeems simple, doesn't it? Well, this has caused a collapse of the market. Instead of the price for an enchantment being set on a city-by-city basis, all of the enchanters of &lt;a href=\"Tamriel\"&gt;Tamriel&lt;/a&gt; have to compete with each other. A hedge enchanter in &lt;a href=\"Daggerfall%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Daggerfall&lt;/a&gt; can make ten fire glyphs and sell them to a traveling merchant, who brings them to the Imperial City and sells them in the marketplace, at a price much below the price set by the &lt;a href=\"Cyrodiil%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Cyrodilic&lt;/a&gt; enchanters.\nAll this competition means that I now make just a few gold over the cost my materials. And this profit does not cover the levy your office places on me.\nUnless your office stops the importation of foreign manufactured glyphs, you must reduce the levy to allow me to stay in business. I will be forced to sell my home of twenty years and take up another profession, perhaps tutoring some merchant's son.\nEagerly waiting your response,\nDefessus Magister"}

When the &lt;a href=\"Night%20Mother\"&gt;Night Mother&lt;/a&gt; called &lt;a href=\"Nazala\"&gt;Nazala&lt;/a&gt; to her service, she had left this place full of disease, death, and fetid waste. Now she returns to complete a contract as old as her absence here. It is possible the target is already dead, but the Sacrament must have an end, and so Nazala must find him.\nThis one begins her search at the &lt;a href=\"Ashen%20Scar\"&gt;Ashen Scar&lt;/a&gt;, one of the many mass burial grounds in &lt;a href=\"Elsweyr%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Elsweyr&lt;/a&gt;. When the &lt;a href=\"Knahaten%20Flu\"&gt;flu&lt;/a&gt; hit, this one saw them being filled. What many call the Ashen Scar is the first of those. It is strong in spiritual power, even one so base as Nazala can feel it. Her target came here looking for something, but doubtful it was what he found. Undead lurk behind every crumbling ruin, dangerous even for one who walks in shadow as this one does.\nThis one found no evidence that her target was among those buried here, so she must look further.\nHer trail leads south, to a place of stone spires and rickety wooden bridges locals call the &lt;a href=\"The%20Stitches\"&gt;Stitches&lt;/a&gt;. It was always a place for the less fortunate, the undeserving, and the lawless to find refuge. Nazala first dragged her claws through blood in this place. She remembers a little cub who said he would change things. He would bring hope to this place. Nazala hears that he did for a time, but now he is gone, like the dream he once carried.\nThis one's target was not here, but she has found those who remember him. He traveled south, alone, with a caravan of nomads trying to escape the flu. Nazala follows.\n&lt;a href=\"Cicatrice\"&gt;Cicatrice&lt;/a&gt; was once home to a small town along the road from &lt;a href=\"Orcrest%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Orcrest&lt;/a&gt; to western Elsweyr. Nomads would stop for food and to tell stories. It was a place of rest and warmth and laughter, but the &lt;a href=\"Knahaten%20Flu\"&gt;Knahaten Flu&lt;/a&gt; destroyed all that. This one has heard rumors that the inhabitants of this place followed an &lt;a href=\"Argonians%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Argonian&lt;/a&gt; into an oasis, hoping for help. Nazala found only a cave full of poison and evidence that her quarry left on his own again.\nThis time he was sick and heading north, to where the scars weep. She knows where that is, but is afraid of what she will find there.\nWhen this one's fur was darker and her claws sharper, she heard tales of the &lt;a href=\"Weeping%20Scar\"&gt;Weeping Scar&lt;/a&gt;. There were &lt;a href=\"Khajiit%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Khajiit&lt;/a&gt; who went down into the dark to feed an addiction of pleasure and blood. Most came back, only to descend once more into the dark. Some, however, stayed.\nNazala's target stayed. She followed him into the dark, where her childish fears manifested into those with fangs and a thirst for blood. They did not attack, though things seemed strained, different. There is a feud going on that this one has no interest in joining. She seeks only her target and these phantoms of her youth provided.\nInfected with the flu, he came to the vampires of the Scar and hoped for everlasting life. He wished to destroy one infection with another, and traded the darkness of death for another type of darkness. It did not work, and Nazala's target passed into the Moon's light.\nThis Khajiit once terrorized a mate and her cub. The &lt;a href=\"skooma\"&gt;skooma&lt;/a&gt; and poverty drove him to anger and that anger drove his mate to commit the Sacrament. That cub came here to fulfill her mother's wish, but discovered that her father found his own darkness.\nShe says goodbye now, the Sacrament satisfied and a daughter left without a need to remain. The Night Mother still softly calls and Nazala answers."}

This guide will help prepare you for the day that you inevitably do. Take heed of that as my first lesson: if you spend any amount of time on sea or shore, you will cross paths with &lt;a href=\"Maormer\"&gt;Sea Elves&lt;/a&gt;.\nAs their name suggests, the Sea Elves are at home on the water. They are so able at plying the waves that a Maormer ship can remain at sea indefinitely, so long as it is sea-worthy. The Maormer take full advantage of that fact when raiding our trade vessels, or ambushing our fleets. Never pursue a retreating Sea Elf vessel, even if you think they are hobbled. They will bait you into thinking you can catch them, but make no mistake: Sea Elf cutters are faster than any ship in our fleet. Soon you will find yourself lured out into the open ocean, unable to safely retreat, while they circle you like sharks. Your food stores will dwindle, and once you are finally too weak to put up a fight, the Maormer will swoop in to slaughter you. It is a cowardly, but effective tactic.\nSecondly, never flee a Sea Elf vessel unless you can see land. Even then, do so with great care. It is not a matter of if the Maormer will overtake you, it is when. The best course of action when confronted by Maormer ships is to stand and fight. At least then you have some hope of coming out ahead. Sea Elf fleets are most often composed of small, agile vessels well-suited to quick hit-and-run engagements. Bloody their noses quickly and you may drive them off before they are committed to their attack.\nWhen fighting the Maormer, their ballistae are the least of your troubles. They can turn the seas themselves against you. Any ship larger than a sloop is sure to have at least one of their Sea Mages beneath its sails, conjuring wind and storm to toss you about like a toy boat. Every effort should be made to neutralize Maormer Sea Mages as quickly as possible. If the waves have not yet done you in, the Sea Elves will sic their beasts on you. Maormer breed and train a variety of marine predators to bolster their ranks. From winged &lt;a href=\"Reef%20Viper\"&gt;reef vipers&lt;/a&gt; that can leap high out of the water and onto your deck, to &lt;a href=\"Sea%20Serpent\"&gt;sea serpents&lt;/a&gt; large enough to capsize a warship. In either case, keep moving at a steady clip and the creatures will have difficulty reaching you before they tire.\nAs for the Maormer themselves, do not let their deceptive tactics fool you. Sea Elves are vicious combatants who want nothing more than to spill &lt;a href=\"Altmer%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Altmer&lt;/a&gt; blood. If they manage to board your vessel, you will have a hard fight on your hands. Maormer are exceptionally steady on their feet in even the roughest waters, and nimbler than an acrobat at traversing a ship's rigging. As you might imagine, well-trained and armored marines are the best defense against boarding, but if you find yourself in the melee you will need to assume a formation that will protect your flanks. Sea Elf raiders prefer enveloping tactics that quickly overwhelm a scattered enemy.\nThere is only so much to be learned from a guide alone, but I hope that this knowledge has better prepared you for the day when your life depends on it. &lt;a href=\"Phynaster\"&gt;Phynaster&lt;/a&gt; guide your sails."}

I was a student who never graduated and was never expelled.\nThough I am not defending myself, I should further define myself. I am not what you would call a prude. In fact, I can speak of subjects in a detached way that would make the most debauched strumpet in Skyhawk blush with discovered modesty. I wrote an essay on &lt;a href=\"The%20House%20of%20Dibella\"&gt;the House of&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Dibella\"&gt;Dibella&lt;/a&gt; as a scholar should, analysing the cult of beauty and physical relations as one might study crop rotation or the digestive system of an &lt;a href=\"Orc%20%28Daggerfall%29\"&gt;Orc&lt;/a&gt;. The acquaintances of mine who were inclined to wink and giggle I tolerated, but barely.\nWith all that said, the reader will understand that when I decided to study the language of the nymphs in order to study their character and culture, it was not a decision I made on account of prurience or lust. Scholars have historically neglected the nymph as a subject worthy of research, and this neglect I attribute to prejudice. The sages with whom I have spoken on the subject have eloquently and intelligently formed sentences which, boiled down, can be translated as: \"Nymphs look like beautiful, naked women who skip along tra-la-la and like to have indisciminate sex. What could they have to say that would be of any interest?\"\nSo here I was faced with the most daunting of projects\u2014to study and research a species unstudied is a potentially rewarding challenge. If the subject was unstudied because the scientific community had deemed it beneath interest, a potentially rewarding but decidedly frustrating challenge. If I spent months in serious study of their language and culture and additional time in their company, and discovered nothing more than that the common prejudice is correct, the term \"laughing stock\" would not do me justice.\nSo, excited and nervous for reasons unrelated to the notoriously promiscuous behavior of my subjects, I began my studies. I mastered the language, a melodious tongue that sounds like wild &lt;a href=\"elf\"&gt;elf&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"faerie\"&gt;faerie&lt;/a&gt; but share no vocabulary with them. I studied the &lt;a href=\"lore\"&gt;lore&lt;/a&gt;, and found it to be on the whole, little more than pornography and crude conjecture.\nI next had to find a nymph.\nFrom my centralized location in the &lt;a href=\"Imperial%20City\"&gt;Imperial City&lt;/a&gt;, I found it easy to send word around to several wellknown temples and guilds devoted to study in all the provinces. Not all replies back were serious in nature, but one, from &lt;a href=\"the%20School%20of%20Julianos\"&gt;the School of Julianos&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Sentinel%20%28Daggerfall%29\"&gt;Sentinel&lt;/a&gt; helped me considerably. To Magister &lt;a href=\"Oitos\"&gt;Oitos&lt;/a&gt; and his disciples, I here offer my sincere gratitude.\nNymphs are extremely shy creatures, no matter what the more obscene stories will tell you. No one who I've spoken with has had one seek him or her out. Thus to speak with a nymph requires energy and patience.\nOut of courtesy for her privacy, I will not here give the location of the little grotto off the coast of &lt;a href=\"Hammerfell\"&gt;Hammerfell&lt;/a&gt;, where I found the nymph. It took three months of patient waiting, leaving presents where I knew the nymph would be, before the nymph stood still at my approach.\nI remember I was carrying a bouquet of purple and white &lt;a href=\"tetias\"&gt;tetias&lt;/a&gt;, and she looked at them and then at me, and smiled. The effect of her smile was truly magical, I'm convinced. Her body was, of course, perfect; her face lovely and serene; her hair like silk flame. But until she smiled, she was beautiful in the abstract, a perfect statue by a master. The smile made her approachable and, thus, terrifying.\n\"For you,\" I said, attempting my first utterance of Nymph to a real nymph.\nHer smile grew into a grin which became a giggle and then a laugh. The reader has doubtless heard of the silver laughter of the elves. The nymph's laugh is earthy and spontaneous, and very ... suggestive.\n\"And what do you want from me in return, mortal?\" she asked.\n\"I am,\" There is no, I should say, known word in the Nymph language for scholar, \"I am a man who likes to learn things. I want to learn things about you.\"\nAnd I did.\nNymphs are the wisest, most wonderful &lt;a href=\"Creatures%20%28Daggerfall%29\"&gt;creatures&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Tamriel\"&gt;Tamriel&lt;/a&gt;. My nymph, her name is &lt;a href=\"Ayalea\"&gt;Ayalea&lt;/a&gt; (a poor phonetic transcription of a word that sounds more like a light wind blowing through a small crack in a hollow chamber) and she knows more about the behavior and varieties of the deep woodland creatures than the greatest &lt;a href=\"Bosmer%20%28Daggerfall%29\"&gt;wood elf&lt;/a&gt; scholar I ever met. She taught me of flowers and &lt;a href=\"Ghost%20%28Daggerfall%29\"&gt;ghosts&lt;/a&gt; and creatures too fast and timid to have ever been seen by man.\nAyalea taught me how to learn for the very first time. How to open my mind to all of the possibilities of life and how to use that knowledge, not just to hold in my cramped brain like a &lt;a href=\"Dragons%20%28Lore%29\"&gt;dragon's&lt;/a&gt; horde.\nIf you ever meet a nymph, speak to her.\nEditor's note: the writer &lt;a href=\"Vondham%20Barres\"&gt;Vondham Barres&lt;/a&gt; is no longer a scholar at the &lt;a href=\"Imperial%20University\"&gt;Imperial University&lt;/a&gt;. He deposited this manuscript and disappeared from the civilized world. His current whereabouts are unknown."}

This quest is given to the &lt;a href=\"Last%20Dragonborn\"&gt;Dragonborn&lt;/a&gt; by &lt;a href=\"Anska\"&gt;Anska&lt;/a&gt;, who is located in &lt;a href=\"High%20Gate%20Ruins\"&gt;High Gate Ruins&lt;/a&gt;.\nWalkthrough.\nUpon entering High Gate Ruins, the Dragonborn will encounter Anska just after she finishes off one of the draugr attacking her with her Destruction magic. She states that she has been searching for the tomb of &lt;a href=\"Dragon%20Priests%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Dragon Priest&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Vokun\"&gt;Vokun&lt;/a&gt; for a few years and believes that the &lt;a href=\"Sealed%20Scroll\"&gt;scroll&lt;/a&gt;, which links her bloodline back to &lt;a href=\"Ysgramor\"&gt;Ysgramor&lt;/a&gt; himself, is located in the ruins. She will then request the Dragonborn to retrieve her scroll. If Anska dies, even if the quest has been completed, another entry will be added.\nHigh Gate Ruins.\nAfter accepting the quest, &lt;a href=\"Anska\"&gt;Anska&lt;/a&gt; will begin to follow the Dragonborn. She mostly relies on her spells, so she will tend to keep her distance from enemies throughout the ruin. The ruin is mostly inhabited by &lt;a href=\"Draugr%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Draugr&lt;/a&gt;, and almost all of them are leveled.\nPuzzle solution: Look up and to the south. Note the sequence of Hawk, Whale, Fox, Snake. The northern ceiling has the same sequence, but the third carving has fallen to the ground. Now match up the pedestals (which also contain a specific animal carving), and activate the lever of the Hawk, Whale, Fox, and Snake pedestals to match the ceiling order. If the puzzle is solved successfully, the grating swings open. Descend the spiral stairs, and enter the door to High Gate Ruins Catacombs.\nHigh Gate Ruins Catacombs.\nThere are more traps (and leveled Draugr) as progress into the ruins is made, so beware of pressure plates and trip-wires. Head through the altar room, then down the long hallway to a second altar room, where three levers must be activated.\nPuzzle solution: Pull the lever in the center of the room. The next is in the right alcove. Fight the Draugr guarding it, activate the lever, and face a second foe in the left alcove before activating the lever behind it.\nThe second lever opens the portcullis allowing entry into Vokun's Throne Room. Upon entering, the dragon priest &lt;a href=\"Vokun\"&gt;Vokun&lt;/a&gt; will awaken from his sarcophagus with a screech, and it will be necessary to defeat him. Utilizing the columns in the room to avoid his attacks will be helpful, as he uses a &lt;a href=\"Staff%20of%20Fireballs\"&gt;Staff of Fireballs&lt;/a&gt; alongside &lt;a href=\"Ebonyflesh\"&gt;Ebonyflesh&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Flame%20Cloak\"&gt;Flame Cloak&lt;/a&gt;. After defeating Vokun, it will be possible to acquire his &lt;a href=\"Vokun%20%28Mask%29\"&gt;mask&lt;/a&gt;. The mask must be picked up there, otherwise it will become impossible to fill the dragon priest shrine at &lt;a href=\"Labyrinthian%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Labyrinthian&lt;/a&gt;.

Locate Anska, and hand the scroll to her. She is most grateful and provides a reward of a &lt;a href=\"Conjure%20Flaming%20Familiar\"&gt;Conjure Flaming Familiar&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Spell%20Tomes%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;spell tome&lt;/a&gt;, completing the quest."}

After they are defeated, go through the hallways of the building; this will lead to another chamber containing the Great Seal. Activating this will recharge it.

Upon arrival, the townspeople will act suspicious, and the villager the Hero is sent to says the girl never showed up.\nWalkthrough.\nChorrol.\nAt the Hero's first arrival in Chorrol, Dar-Ma will enter a conversation with them, prompting two options, to send Dar-Ma away, or to be friendly to her. After three days, if the hero leaves town and returns, there will be rumors that she is missing. Wait two more days and then talk to Seed-Neeus, Dar-Ma's mother.\nIf the hero was friendly to Dar-Ma, Seed-Neeus will have a &lt;a href=\"disposition\"&gt;disposition&lt;/a&gt; of over 50 and will plead for help, saying that Dar-Ma went missing while making her delivery to the\u00a0village of Hackdirt. Seed-Neeus also mentions that Dar-Ma was with her horse, Blossom. If the hero was unfriendly to Dar-Ma, raise Seed-Neeus' disposition or go out and hear more rumors, at which point Seed-Neeus will ask for help.\nHackdirt.\nTravel to Hackdirt, a small ruined town outside Chorrol. After locating Blossom, talk to the townspeople. All of them will be hostile, with their dispositions ranging from zero to five. In conversations with the townsfolk, they only give surly responses. The quest target will point to the inn. Renting a room for 30 from the innkeeper will allow the option to sneak into the room Dar-Ma stayed in. Alternatively, the inn will be empty in the evening, making it possible to just enter then and break into the rooms.\nIn the room, there is a ransacked dresser, and \"&lt;a href=\"Dar-Ma%27s%20Diary\"&gt;Dar-Ma's Diary&lt;/a&gt;\". The diary tells about her sudden disappearance, and characterizes the innkeeper as nasty, as well as giving some of Dar-Ma's backstory. The Hero can then choose to go downstairs and confront the innkeeper, who will be angry saying that Dar-Ma left the diary at the inn. If the diary is taken, it will show as stolen and it cannot be given back to her. If the diary was obtained after breaking into the rooms, it will already be marked as stolen and there will not be an option to mention it to the innkeeper. Even though it is possible to say that she left her belongings in the room, it does not appear to affect the story.\nAsk around the town and, eventually, find &lt;a href=\"Jiv%20Hiriel\"&gt;Jiv Hiriel&lt;/a&gt; who will say to meet him in his house after dark. Do so, and he will explain the situation, and provide a key to the &lt;a href=\"Hackdirt%20Caverns\"&gt;caverns&lt;/a&gt; beneath the town. He advises entering the caverns through the trapdoor in the inn.\nGoing this way can avoid all of the enemies, as the girl's cell is right next to the ladder. It is best to do this between 1 AM and 5 AM as all the townsfolk will be occupied in the Gathering. The only people in the caverns are the &lt;a href=\"Hackdirt%20Brethren\"&gt;Hackdirt Brethren&lt;/a&gt;. Then all that has to be done is to get her back to Chorrol unharmed, while the entire town turns hostile. She can be helped to get her horse, Blossom, but this is optional.\nIn the cavern, where Dar-Ma is imprisoned, there are three crates stacked together in the middle of the room. The large crate will contain a random, leveled blunt weapon or bow.\nHeading back to Chorrol.\nEscort Dar-Ma to Chorrol and speak with her mother, but after Dar-Ma retrieves her horse, she will approach to talk. After the conversation, she will head toward home and the Hero is forced to follow her. She tends to walk directly toward any creatures without concern, which makes escorting her difficult. However, if she is never allowed to get close enough to talk, she will continue to walk towards the Hero, allowing her to be lead around enemies. Only let her speak at Chorrol's gates.\nAlternatively, once the Hero has talked to her and agreed to take her back to Chorrol, fast travel to Chorrol and she should be there as well.\nOnce the quest is finished, Dar-Ma's disposition towards the Hero will be 100 and she will give them free &lt;a href=\"Mercantile%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;mercantile&lt;/a&gt; training.\nAlternative.\nWithout knowing anything of the captured girl or her mother in Chorrol, the Hero can &lt;a href=\"lockpick%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;pick&lt;/a&gt; the lock on any of the trap doors in the village and find the imprisoned girl in the caves, who asks to be taken back to her mother, at which point the quest proceeds as above. This method tends to have a higher body count in terms of generic villagers underground."}

When the scattered Dunmer tribes consolidated into the predecessors of the modern Great House clans, they threw out the Nord oppressors and successfully resisted further incursions.\nThe ancient ancestor worship of the tribes was in time superseded by the monolithic &lt;a href=\"Tribunal%20Temple\"&gt;Tribunal Temple&lt;/a&gt; theocracy, and the Dunmer grew into a great nation called &lt;a href=\"Resdayn\"&gt;Resdayn&lt;/a&gt;. Resdayn was the last of the provinces to submit to &lt;a href=\"Tiber%20Septim\"&gt;Tiber Septim&lt;/a&gt;; like &lt;a href=\"Black%20Marsh\"&gt;Black Marsh&lt;/a&gt;, it was never successfully invaded, and was peacefully incorporated by treaty into the &lt;a href=\"Empire\"&gt;Empire&lt;/a&gt; as the Province of &lt;a href=\"Morrowind\"&gt;Morrowind&lt;/a&gt;.\nAlmost four centuries after the coming of the &lt;a href=\"Imperial%20Legion%20%28Morrowind%29\"&gt;Imperial Legions&lt;/a&gt;, Morrowind is still occupied by Imperial legions, with a figurehead Imperial King, though the Empire has reserved most functions of the traditional local government to the Ruling Councils of the Five Great Houses...\nIn &lt;a href=\"3E%20414\"&gt;3E 414&lt;/a&gt;, Vvardenfell Territory, previously a Temple preserved under Imperial protection and Ordinator laws, was reorganized as an Imperial Provincial District. Vvardenfell had been maintained as a preserve administrated by the Temple since the &lt;a href=\"Treaty%20of%20the%20Armistice\"&gt;Treaty of the Armistice&lt;/a&gt;, and except for a few Great House settlements sanctioned by the Temple, Vvardenfell was previously uninhabited and undeveloped. But when the centuries-old Temple ban on trade and settlement of Vvardenfell was revoked by King of Morrowind, a flood of Imperial colonists and Great House Dunmer came to Vvardenfell, expanding old settlements and building new ones.\nThe new District was divided into &lt;a href=\"House%20Redoran%20%28Morrowind%29\"&gt;Redoran&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"House%20Hlaalu%20%28Morrowind%29\"&gt;Hlaalu&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"House%20Telvanni%20%28Morrowind%29\"&gt;Telvanni&lt;/a&gt;, and Temple Districts, each separately administered by local House Councils or Temple Priesthoods, and all under the advice and consent of &lt;a href=\"Duke%20Vedam%20Dren%20%28Morrowind%29\"&gt;Duke Dren&lt;/a&gt; and the District Council in &lt;a href=\"Ebonheart\"&gt;Ebonheart&lt;/a&gt;. Local law became a mixture of House Law and Imperial Law in House Districts, jointly enforced by House guards and Legion guards, with Temple law and Imperial law enforced in the Temple district by &lt;a href=\"Ordinators\"&gt;Ordinators&lt;/a&gt;. The Temple was still recognized as the majority religion, but worship of the &lt;a href=\"Nine%20Divines\"&gt;Nine Divines&lt;/a&gt; was protected by the legions and encouraged by &lt;a href=\"Imperial%20Cult\"&gt;Imperial cult&lt;/a&gt; missions.\nThe Temple District included the city of &lt;a href=\"Vivec%20City%20%28Morrowind%29\"&gt;Vivec City&lt;/a&gt;, the fortress of &lt;a href=\"Ghostgate\"&gt;Ghostgate&lt;/a&gt;, and all sacred and profane sites (including those &lt;a href=\"Blight\"&gt;Blight&lt;/a&gt;ed areas inside the &lt;a href=\"Ghostfence\"&gt;Ghostfence&lt;/a&gt;) and all unsettled and wilderness areas on Vvardenfell. In practice, this district included all parts of Vvardenfell not claimed for Redoran, Hlaalu, or Telvanni Districts. The Temple stubbornly fought all development in their district, and were largely successful.\n&lt;a href=\"House%20Hlaalu\"&gt;House Hlaalu&lt;/a&gt; in combination with Imperial colonists embarked on a vigorous campaign of settlement and development. In the decades after reorganization, &lt;a href=\"Balmora\"&gt;Balmora&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Ascadian%20Isles\"&gt;Ascadian Isles&lt;/a&gt; regions have grown steadily. &lt;a href=\"Caldera%20%28Morrowind%29\"&gt;Caldera&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Pelagiad\"&gt;Pelagiad&lt;/a&gt; are completely new settlements, and all legion forts were expanded to accommodate larger garrisons.\nHouse Telvanni, normally conservative and isolationist, has been surprisingly aggressive in expanding beyond their traditional tower villages. Disregarding the protests of the other Houses, the Temple, the Duke, and the District council, Telvanni pioneers have been encroaching on the wild lands reserved to the Temple. The Telvanni council officially disavows responsibility for these rogue Telvanni settlements, but it is an open secret that they are encouraged and supported by ambitious Telvanni mage-lords.\nUnder pressure from the Temple, conservative House Redoran has steadfastly resisted expansion in their district. As a result, House Redoran and the Temple are in danger of being politically and economically marginalized by the more aggressive and expansionist Hlaalu and Telvanni interests.\nThe Imperial administration faces many challenges in the Vvardenfell district, but the most serious are the Great House rivalries, animosity from the &lt;a href=\"Ashlanders%20%28Morrowind%29\"&gt;Ashlanders&lt;/a&gt; nomads, internal conflicts within the Temple itself, and the &lt;a href=\"Red%20Mountain\"&gt;Red Mountain&lt;/a&gt; blight. Struggles between Great House, Temple, and Imperial interests to control Vvardenfell's resource could at any time erupt into full-scale war. Ashlanders raid settlements, plunder caravans, and kill foreigners on their wild lands. The Temple has unsuccessfully attempted to silence criticism and calls for reform within its ranks.\nBut most serious are the plagues and diseased hosts produced by the blight storms sweeping out from Red Mountain. Vvardenfell and all Morrowind have long been menaced by the legendary evils of &lt;a href=\"Dagoth%20Ur%20%28Character%29\"&gt;Dagoth Ur&lt;/a&gt; and his &lt;a href=\"ash%20vampire\"&gt;ash vampire&lt;/a&gt; kin dwelling beneath Red Mountain. For centuries the Temple has contained this threat within the Ghostfence. But recently the Temple's resources and will have faltered, and the threat from Red Mountain has grown in scale and intensity. If the Ghostfence should fail, and hosts of blighted monsters were to spill out across Vvardenfell's towns and villages, the Empire might have no choice but to evacuate Vvardenfell district and abandon it to disease and corruption."}

Once the &lt;a href=\"Nerevarine\"&gt;Nerevarine&lt;/a&gt; has &lt;a href=\"Investigate%20Bamz-Amschend\"&gt;investigated Bamz-Amschend&lt;/a&gt;, and become &lt;a href=\"Helseth%27s%20Champion\"&gt;Helseth's Champion&lt;/a&gt;, they are tasked by the &lt;a href=\"Almalexia%20%28Tribunal%29\"&gt;Lady Almalexia&lt;/a&gt; to demonstrate her power to an anti-Tribunal cult.\nWalkthrough.\nHaving become the Champion of King Helseth, and witnessed the battle under &lt;a href=\"Bamz-Amschend\"&gt;Bamz-Amschend&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"Nerevarine\"&gt;Nerevarine&lt;/a&gt; is instructed by &lt;a href=\"Fedris%20Hler\"&gt;Fedris Hler&lt;/a&gt; to speak with the &lt;a href=\"Almalexia%20%28Tribunal%29\"&gt;Lady Almalexia&lt;/a&gt;. Almalexia, when spoken to, speaks of her concern about the \"&lt;a href=\"End%20of%20Times%20Cult\"&gt;End of Times Cult&lt;/a&gt;\" which has emerged in &lt;a href=\"Mournhold%20%28Tribunal%29\"&gt;Mournhold&lt;/a&gt;, and its potential threat to the &lt;a href=\"Tribunal\"&gt;Tribunal&lt;/a&gt; and the people of Mournhold. She therefore orders that the Nerevarine speak to &lt;a href=\"Meralyn%20Othan\"&gt;Meralyn Othan&lt;/a&gt; to find the Cult's &lt;a href=\"Eno%20Romari\"&gt;leader&lt;/a&gt;. However, with its members being murdered all over Mournhold, Almalexia requests that Romari not be killed for fear of becoming a martyr.\nEnd Times or \"Enlightenment\".\nThe Nerevarine may speak with Meralyn Othan, she can be found, outside, on the eastern side of the &lt;a href=\"Great%20Bazaar\"&gt;Great Bazaar&lt;/a&gt;, at the top of the steps. She reveals that her brother, Sevil Othan, was among those Cult members murdered with an unusual poison. She also suggests that the Cult have a suicidal approach to their cause, and that their leader Romari can be found in &lt;a href=\"Godsreach\"&gt;Godsreach&lt;/a&gt;, possibly frequenting the &lt;a href=\"The%20Winged%20Guar\"&gt;Winged Guar&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe leader of the cult, Romari, is found outside the tavern in Godsreach, and is also open about his leadership of the Cult, as well as their \"cleansing\" ritual, committing suicide through taking poison. He also states his belief that this is an enlightenment group, and that their cause is founded in the fact that the Tribunal is dying. Both \"End of Times\" and \"The Cleansing\" topics must be discussed for the quest to advance. The Nerevarine must then report this information to Almalexia.\nAlmalexia.\nBack at the &lt;a href=\"Mournhold%20Temple%20%28Tribunal%29\"&gt;Mournhold Temple&lt;/a&gt; Almalexia becomes enraged that Romari is so open about his belief, and demands that the weather device, &lt;a href=\"Karstangz-Bcharn\"&gt;Karstangz-Bcharn&lt;/a&gt;, be activated within &lt;a href=\"Bamz-Amschend\"&gt;Bamz-Amschend&lt;/a&gt;. The device, according to Almalexia, is capable of generating ashstorms over Mournhold, which she believes will serve as a demonstration of her power. The Nerevarine must therefore enter the ruins under Mournhold once again, and power up the device, using the &lt;a href=\"Powered%20Dwemer%20Coherer\"&gt;Powered Dwemer Coherer&lt;/a&gt; she gives them.\nBack to Bamz-Amschend.\nUsing the hole under the broken statue in &lt;a href=\"Plaza%20Brindisi%20Dorom\"&gt;Plaza Brindisi Dorom&lt;/a&gt;, the Nerevarine enters Bamz-Amschend, and into the Hearthfire Hall. From here, the Nerevarine must head to Radac's Forge within the ruin to pick up two important tools for the quest. Within the Forge is a locked door, which can be opened with a key found in the remains of a &lt;a href=\"Dwemer\"&gt;Dwemer&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Animunculi\"&gt;creature&lt;/a&gt; in a nearby room, then the Nerevarine must retrieve two &lt;a href=\"Dwemer%20Satchel%20Pack\"&gt;Dwemer Satchel Pack&lt;/a&gt;s, required to advance through the rest of the ruin.\nThe Nerevarine will come across a pile of rocks that can be interacted with at some point in the Forge, obscuring an area named the Passge of the Walker. Placing one of the Satchels in the rocks, the Nerevarine must run a fair distance away from the rocks before the Satchel explodes, revealing the path. Following the Passage of the Walker will lead the Nerevarine to the next area.\nBreaking the skies.\nThe Nerevarine should emerge in the Skybreak Gallery, with a platform in the centre with three protruding levers. Attempting to pull the levers does little, the Nerevarine needs to place the Powered Dwemer Coherer, given to them by Almalexia, into a junction box within the room. Returning to the levers, the Nerevarine must pull the levers until ashstorms strike Mournhold, which is reported by a Journal entry. Now, the Nerevarine may return to Almalexia.\nThe Nerevarine will witness the effect of the ashstorms on Mournhold as they approach the Temple, with a general sense of fear coming from those spoken to. Almalexia will, however, respond gladly to the events, and send the Nerevarine on their next errand: &lt;a href=\"The%20Missing%20Hand\"&gt;The Missing Hand&lt;/a&gt;."}

Once found, the Agent must enter and find the undead, most likely roaming around in the attic. The creature will attack the Agent on sight, and will state when first hit: \"In life I built this house. What right do the living have to interrupt my deathly dreams?\"\nOnce the undead has been killed, the Agent must return to the Missionary before the time limit to complete the quest and receive the potential reward.\nReward.\nSuccessfully completing the quest will improve the Agent's standing with the specific Temple, potentially raising it high enough to enable them to join as a Novice.

As the Orcs gathered into clans, they developed the concept of \"courage\" ball. It started not as a sport or recreational pastime, but as a way to test the bravery and resilience of clan warriors.\nThe earliest forms of vosh ball utilized a heavy sphere made of wood or metal that was about the size of an Orc's head. The novice warrior to be tested stood on the far end of a paced off court, staring down a battery of veteran warriors, each armed with a vosh ball. The veterans would each toss their vosh ball in turn, hurling it with as much strength as they could muster. If the novice was still standing after the volley of heavy missiles subsided, he proved his courage and was promoted higher into the warrior ranks.\nAs time went on, the test became an organized sport, with teams competing for honor and recognition among the clans. The heavy metal ball was replaced with a heavy leather ball, and rules and regulations were formalized and agreed to among the participating clans.\nToday, no gathering of clans is complete without a rousing, multiple-day vosh ball contest. &lt;a href=\"Fharun%20Clan\"&gt;Fharun Clan&lt;/a&gt; holds the current record for ongoing victories, winning the last seven \"series of the clans\" by wide margins. &lt;a href=\"Chief%20Bazrag\"&gt;Chief Bazrag&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"Fharun%20Stronghold\"&gt;Fharun&lt;/a&gt;, the Fharun's most valuable player, has a particularly nasty and powerful toss he affectionately refers to as \"the bone-breaker.\"\nWhile the rules of vosh ball are constantly changing, the basic structure of the game remains the same. Two teams of six Orcs each, all armed with a sling of three vosh balls, competes to control the enclosed court by rendering their opponents unconscious by hurling the heavy spheres with all of their might. Beyond that, there are dozens of rules and regulations that non-Orcs find confusing and contradictory. No matter. Anyone who has ever witnessed the game played in all its glory comes away excited, breathless, and with a renewed understanding of the definition of courage."}

Only the staff will help me put an end to Ancano's abuse of the Eye of Magnus.\"\nWalkthrough.\nTraversing Labyrinthian, the Dragonborn must search for the fabled Staff of Magnus, which is needed to control the Eye of Magnus. &lt;a href=\"Morokei%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Morokei&lt;/a&gt;, a &lt;a href=\"Dragon%20Priests%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Dragon Priest&lt;/a&gt;, holds the staff and must be battled to obtain it. The battle is difficult and recommended for &lt;a href=\"Character%20Level\"&gt;levels&lt;/a&gt; 20 and above.\nPreparation.\nShock-resistant armor will make this quest easier, as the boss uses high level shock magic and can even summon a &lt;a href=\"Storm%20Atronach%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;storm atronach&lt;/a&gt;. The &lt;a href=\"Arch-Mage%27s%20Quarters%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Arch-Mage's Quarters&lt;/a&gt; at the College of Winterhold has a pair of boots with 40% &lt;a href=\"Resist%20Shock%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;shock resistance&lt;/a&gt; on top of the short &lt;a href=\"Containers%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;wardrobe&lt;/a&gt; to the right of the bed. Also in the quarters is a &lt;a href=\"Potions%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Draught of Resist Shock&lt;/a&gt; on the shelves with the &lt;a href=\"Alchemy%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;alchemical&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Ingredients%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;ingredients&lt;/a&gt;. Approximately four potions of resist shock can be made with the ingredients found here, alleviating some of the difficulty of the boss battle.\nLabyrinthian.\nUpon arriving at Labyrinthian, there are many staircases leading up. Following the quest marker up the steps leads to a large stone door named the ceremonial door. Just before the door is reached, a conversation takes place between the ghosts of six former College mages who undertook an expedition within Labyrinthian. The group is led by &lt;a href=\"Atmah\"&gt;Atmah&lt;/a&gt; and also includes &lt;a href=\"Savos%20Aren\"&gt;Savos Aren&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Takes-In-Light\"&gt;Takes-In-Light&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Elvali%20Veren\"&gt;Elvali Veren&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Girduin\"&gt;Girduin&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Hafnar%20Ice-Fist\"&gt;Hafnar Ice-Fist&lt;/a&gt;.\nOnce the ghosts disappear, the door can be opened. Opening it requires the &lt;a href=\"Torc%20of%20Labyrinthian\"&gt;Torc of Labyrinthian&lt;/a&gt;, which was given to the Dragonborn by &lt;a href=\"Mirabelle%20Ervine\"&gt;Mirabelle Ervine&lt;/a&gt; following Savos Aren's death. Thus, Labyrinthian is entered.\nThe foyer inside the entrance contains numerous &lt;a href=\"Skeleton%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;skeletons&lt;/a&gt;. On the right (east) side, on a table, is a randomly generated &lt;a href=\"Spell%20Tomes%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;spell tome&lt;/a&gt;. Possible tomes found here include &lt;a href=\"Detect%20Life%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Detect Life&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Ironflesh\"&gt;Ironflesh&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Telekinesis%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Telekinesis&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Waterbreathing%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Waterbreathing&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Equilibrium%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Equilibrium&lt;/a&gt;. Upon approaching this table, the six ghosts will appear again, talking about what they expect to find inside. An iron door on the north end leads further in to the ruin.\nA path leads down and curves to the right (east). Just outside a narrow passageway, that leads to a closed iron gate, is a lever that opens them. The gate remains open only for a short time, so sprinting is advisable; &lt;a href=\"Whirlwind%20Sprint\"&gt;Whirlwind Sprint&lt;/a&gt; will almost certainly achieve this. Alternatively, however, ranged attacks which can be fired through the bars may be a wise idea. A third option is to have a follower activate the lever which permits the Dragonborn enough time to enter the room in stealth before the gate closes. The huge room beyond the bars contains several animated skeletons, including a &lt;a href=\"Skeletal%20Dragon%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;skeletal dragon&lt;/a&gt;. All of these can be looted once defeated, although it should be noted that the dragon does not have a &lt;a href=\"Dragon%20Soul\"&gt;soul&lt;/a&gt; to absorb. There are also several urns scattered about the edges of the room, containing gold and a few potions.\nAt the eastern end of the room, steps lead down to a pedestal on which is an etched tablet. Upon approaching the pedestal, the mage ghosts appear again, in which they discuss their encounter with the dragon and other skeletons and the fact that Girduin perished in the battle.\nThe etched tablet reads:\n&lt;poem&gt;\n\"Hail All - Brave City Bromjunaar\nForever These Walls Shall Stand\nMay Enemies See Her Majesty\nMay all Quake to Behold Her\"&lt;/poem&gt;\nThe path turns right (south) down stairs to double wooden doors that enter the next area.\nLabyrinthian Chasm.\nAgainst the right (west) wall is a raised area with a bench. To the right of the bench, behind a pillar, is an urn containing minor loot. The main chamber has two sets of downward steps to the south - the left steps come to a dead end with several urns.\nDown the right-hand stairs is a room that holds a frozen door and two guardians: a restless draugr, which is in an alcove in the right (northwest) wall, and a frost spirit that emerges from the iced-over door. An ethereal voice speaks to the Dragonborn before they enter the room; this experience depletes all of the Dragonborn's &lt;a href=\"Magicka%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;magicka&lt;/a&gt;. A door is covered in ice and impassable, so melt the ice using &lt;a href=\"Flames%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Flames&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Fire%20Breath%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Fire Breath&lt;/a&gt;, or another form of &lt;a href=\"Fire%20Damage%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;fire magic&lt;/a&gt;. After the door opens a \"frost spirit\" appears and will either attack with &lt;a href=\"ancient%20Nord%20sword\"&gt;ancient Nord sword&lt;/a&gt;s or &lt;a href=\"Frost%20Damage%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;frost magic&lt;/a&gt;. A spell tome is in an alcove in the south wall.\nThe door just opened reveals a passage down to the west. Starting down the path will trigger another encounter with the ethereal voice that drains magicka. The passage opens up to a pit with a walkway curving down roughly counter-clockwise. At the landing are two &lt;a href=\"Draugr%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;draugr wights&lt;/a&gt;, a &lt;a href=\"Troll%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;troll&lt;/a&gt;, or a &lt;a href=\"Frost%20Atronach%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;frost atronach&lt;/a&gt;, depending on the Dragonborn's level. An opening to the south lies behind them. It leads down, turns right (west), and heads down another staircase where a draugr awaits. At the bottom, the path turns left (south).\nOn the left (east) side is a door, sealed with a &lt;a href=\"Lightning%20Rune\"&gt;Lightning Rune&lt;/a&gt;. This rune does approximately 100 points of &lt;a href=\"Shock%20Damage%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;lightning damage&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Ward%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;ward&lt;/a&gt;s do not protect against it. However, the draugr in the room can open the door from the other side and set off the rune. Flinging projectiles at the trap may spring it prematurely. In this room, on a table, sits a spell tome for the &lt;a href=\"Alteration%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Alteration&lt;/a&gt; spell &lt;a href=\"Equilibrium%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Equilibrium&lt;/a&gt; which turns 25 points of &lt;a href=\"Health%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;health&lt;/a&gt; into magicka per second. There is also an &lt;a href=\"Alchemy%20Lab%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;alchemy lab&lt;/a&gt; and an &lt;a href=\"Arcane%20Enchanter%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;arcane enchanter&lt;/a&gt;, along with a chest and some supplies. In a chair, in front of the enchanter, sits the skeleton of a novice conjurer with some loot.\nBack out in the original pit, continuing down further triggers a third encounter with the magicka-draining voice, who this time speaks in the common tongue (\"Must I use this guttural language of yours?\"). At one point, it is possible to turn left (south) or go straight (west) across a stone walkway.\nAcross the walkway is an opening leading northwest up a few stairs. After a jog to the right, there is an arched walkway with a draugr standing guard on the other side. Beyond it is another draugr. At the northwestern end of the room are several urns and a piece of &lt;a href=\"gold%20ore\"&gt;gold ore&lt;/a&gt;.\nTurning around, a set of steps leads down back to the southeast (next to the walkway just crossed). There are several shelves and an urn with minor loot. To the left (north northwest), an open wooden door leads to a rough passage down to a river. Against the right wall, a ledge leads to a dead &lt;a href=\"Argonians%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Argonian&lt;/a&gt;, a &lt;a href=\"coin%20purse\"&gt;coin purse&lt;/a&gt;, and a chest.\nThe river flows left (north) to a door to the next section. However, it is also possible to turn right (south) and walk through the rest of the cave that was skipped before. There is a &lt;a href=\"Nirnroot%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;nirnroot&lt;/a&gt; on the right side. Near the end, a set of steps leads up to the left (east) to a dead end. At the very end, a rough ledge leads back up to the right, and eventually back to the place where the voice was heard for the third time.\nBack in the river, now following the current, the magicka-draining voice speaks for a fourth time (\"Have you returned, Aren? My old friend.\"). A door leads to the next section, the Labyrinthian Thoroughfare.\nLabyrinthian Thoroughfare.\nThe path starts out to the west, through a metal gate to where several draugr and/or skeletons lie in wait. A novice-locked gate lies ahead, but an alternate path leads right (north). Through the gate, the path turns left (south) and leads to an iron grate that can't be opened. There is a path to the right (west) just before the grate that leads to an alcove with two chests and two urns. The path turns right, then left and leads to a broken archway from which it is possible to jump down to water.\nHowever, returning to the room with the novice gate and following the path north, it immediately turns back left (west). Upon starting down that path, the magicka-draining voice says, \"Do you seek to finish that which you could not?\" The path turns right again. At the point of the next turn, a small pool of water to the right has a piece of &lt;a href=\"malachite%20ore\"&gt;malachite ore&lt;/a&gt;. It may be necessary to move it to a shallower location to pick it up.\nContinuing forward to the west, there is a stone walkway straight ahead, but it leads to a dead end. It is possible to turn left and walk down the rough area to which it was possible to jump down earlier. At the end with the waterfall, the path turns right, then leads down a free-standing set of steps to the floor of a large room. Behind these steps against the southern wall of the room is a chest. Against the northern wall are three fixed grates that provide a view of a room beyond. Against the eastern wall is a passageway leading north that is protected by a troll. Along this path, the magicka-draining voice speaks again, saying, \"You only face failure once more.\"\nThis path leads to an opening midway up the wall of an even larger room. A staircase along the right-hand (east) wall leads down to a landing. An arched walkway leads left (west), while the stairs continue down to the floor, where several draugr or skeletons lie in wait. Across the walkway, the path leads west past a troll to a room that contains another troll, a chest, an urn, and several bunches of &lt;a href=\"Nightshade%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;nightshade&lt;/a&gt;.\nBack in the main room, halfway down the steps, the voice says, \"You are not Aren, are you? Has he sent you in his place?\" At the southwestern end of the room are two &lt;a href=\"gold%20ore\"&gt;gold ore&lt;/a&gt; veins, although one can not be mined.\nThe northeastern end of the room has another gate, operated by a lever. Beyond the gate is a pathway to the left. At the end, turning left (southwest) leads to a set of steps going up to the left that eventually come out on the area above the battlements of the gateway; a chest and a skull are found here.\nBack down the steps and heading northeast, there are three wisps floating around a fire and what appear to be gravestones. The wisps are non-hostile until the Dragonborn runs past them, or attacks first. The &lt;a href=\"Wispmother%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;wispmother&lt;/a&gt; will appear on the raised platform near the empty coffins.\nIn the northeastern corner of the room, from the raised platform, an opening leads to a door which is on fire. When approaching it, the voice says, \"Did he warn you that your own power would be your undoing? That it would only serve to strengthen me?\" If the door is approached too closely, a fire spirit may attack, as the frost spirit had earlier, though it can cast fire magic as well as use melee attacks.\nThe door can be opened with frost magic, such as &lt;a href=\"Frostbite%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Frostbite&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Frost%20Breath\"&gt;Frost Breath&lt;/a&gt; or other frost-based magic. A Frostbite spell tome and two &lt;a href=\"Scroll%20of%20Ice%20Spike\"&gt;Scroll of Ice Spike&lt;/a&gt;s are found to the left of the door within a small gray circle.\nThe door leads east to a junction. Proceeding straight leads to a dead end with several urns. To the left (north), a metal gate opens to a small room, where another vision of Savos Aren and his expedition is seen. The group has again grown smaller, as Elvali Veren was killed by \"something from behind\" before anyone could save her. The room contains a spiral downward ramp that leads nowhere.\nMoving forward to the east, the voice says \"Come, face your end.\" At the other end is a small room with a waterfall falling on a metal grate in the floor. A skeleton, a draugr wight, and a &lt;a href=\"spectral%20warhound\"&gt;spectral warhound&lt;/a&gt; are all here. The wight may drop a &lt;a href=\"drainheart%20sword\"&gt;drainheart sword&lt;/a&gt; or similar item, as do many of the other spectral foes in this dungeon.\nThe path proceeds southeast, then east, leading down some stairs. It turns left (north), then left again (west). In the next room are two more spectral foes, and a skeletal compatriot below them. A gold ingot and a soul gem can be found on a bookcase in the upper level where the room is first entered. There are two spectral foes beyond the next door. The path then leads right and down steps to a door to the Labyrinthian Tribune.\nLabyrinthian Tribune.\nThe Tribune is a tomb, with more spectral foes to defeat. The path starts out heading west. It turns left (south), and heads down a set of stairs to a pedestal with a spell tome of &lt;a href=\"Steadfast%20Ward%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Steadfast Ward&lt;/a&gt; and a chest. After turning right (west), more stairs lead down to fireball and ice storm &lt;a href=\"Traps%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;traps&lt;/a&gt;. These traps can be deactivated with anything that dislodges the soul gems powering them (e.g., arrows or a &lt;a href=\"Fireball%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Fireball&lt;/a&gt; spell), or one can simply run in and take the gem before it fires. The &lt;a href=\"shout\"&gt;shout&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Become%20Ethereal\"&gt;Become Ethereal&lt;/a&gt;, can be used to gather them one by one without taking damage.\nAt the end of the hallway, steps go up to the right (north). At the top, the path goes left (west) to a large pit. To the left, a wooden walkway leads up into a tower with several spectral foes, two chests and several urns. A ledge along the right wall leads down to more spectral enemies. At the very bottom is a pool.\nBefore reaching the bottom, a path leads west. Walking through it triggers another drain of magicka, although with no voice this time. At the end is a T intersection. To the left is an adept-locked gate. Beyond this is some worthwhile loot, including an &lt;a href=\"Ebony%20Shield%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;ebony shield&lt;/a&gt;, an &lt;a href=\"Enchanted%20Weapons%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;enchanted sword&lt;/a&gt;, and a &lt;a href=\"Ancient%20Helmet%20of%20the%20Unburned\"&gt;unique helmet&lt;/a&gt;.\nBack at the T intersection, to the right, steps lead down to a door where magicka again is drained with no warning. Beyond it, a draugr deathlord sits on a throne facing away from the door; with a high &lt;a href=\"Sneak%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Sneak&lt;/a&gt; skill, the Dragonborn can approach it without detection and do some damage before it has a chance to rise. Once defeated, down the stairs is a &lt;a href=\"Word%20Walls%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;word wall&lt;/a&gt; to learn the &lt;a href=\"Dragon%20Language\"&gt;word of power&lt;/a&gt; for the &lt;a href=\"Slow%20Time\"&gt;Slow Time&lt;/a&gt; shout. There is also a chest hidden on the right (north) side of the room behind a dead tree.\nThe next hallway contains a few foes - two draugr, and two other foes, which the Dragonborn can draw out of hiding by firing an arrow down the hallway. In the alcove on the left side of the hallway are two &lt;a href=\"Ebony%20Ingot%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;ebony ingots&lt;/a&gt;.\nAt the far end, in the next room, another vision of Savos and friends appears, in which they talk about how their number has again decreased; Takes-In-Light was mortally injured and urged the remaining three companions to leave her, but the spirits of Savos, Atmah, and Hafnar pledge to one another that they will see their quest through to its end. This room contains more loot, including a black soul gem.\nTo the left (south), behind a final door, stands the &lt;a href=\"Dragon%20Priests%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Dragon Priest&lt;/a&gt; Morokei, who wields the long-sought &lt;a href=\"Staff%20of%20Magnus%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Staff of Magnus&lt;/a&gt;. He is sealed inside a magical aura, which is being sustained by a pair of &lt;a href=\"enthralled%20wizard\"&gt;enthralled wizard&lt;/a&gt;s; these are all that remain of Atmah and Hafnar, whom Savos sacrificed in order to contain the power of the Dragon Priest.\nFighting Morokei.\nThis fight is not recommended for levels 20 and below. Morokei uses wards, shouts, &lt;a href=\"Mage%20Armor\"&gt;Mage Armor&lt;/a&gt;, and shock spells, but also has a spell which may convert &lt;a href=\"Summon%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;summoned beings&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"zombie\"&gt;zombie&lt;/a&gt;s against their summoner. Creatures conjured by &lt;a href=\"Scrolls%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;scrolls&lt;/a&gt; are not affected by this, however, the same applies to the Flaming Familiar.\nOnce he locks onto his target, he does not move. As he has high-damage spells, attacking him at melee range is difficult; ranged attacks are most effective. If a straight-forward fight proves to be too difficult, there are a number of strategies the player can use to defeat him:\nTo kill Morokei, it is necessary to defeat the enthralled wizards first. At that point, Morokei becomes free. Using long range attacks from above will finish him off. From this position, his spells may not reach the Dragonborn and hurt them.\nLeaving Labyrinthian.\nThere is a chest at the bottom of the pool of water. Be warned that a &lt;a href=\"Slaughterfish%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;slaughterfish&lt;/a&gt; is in the pool. There are &lt;a href=\"Deathbell%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;deathbells&lt;/a&gt; near the pool. Behind the ledge where the lower of the two enthralled wizards was positioned is the staircase leading to the exit. There are two chests in this room; one is right near the exit door, while the other is concealed in a narrow passage on the left (north) side of the stairs (it can be viewed from the chamber where Morokei was slain, through a gated window).\nOne last ghostly vision is encountered upon leaving, in which Savos Aren apologizes to his dead friends for having sacrificed them to seal Morokei, and promising that he will make sure no one is ever able to enter Labyrinthian again.\nFinally, up the path to the east, then turning south and climbing stairs, an opening to the sky can be found. To the left (east) is a gate with a lever beside it. When it is opened, &lt;a href=\"Estormo\"&gt;Estormo&lt;/a&gt;, a &lt;a href=\"Thalmor%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Thalmor&lt;/a&gt; mage, attacks so that he can retrieve the Staff of Magnus for &lt;a href=\"Ancano%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Ancano&lt;/a&gt;. He can be killed, or it is possible to sneak past him. Proceeding south leads to a ladder that allows exiting to Skyrim.\nIt is impossible to return to the College of Winterhold, because it is now completely surrounded by the force of the Eye. &lt;a href=\"Tolfdir%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Tolfdir&lt;/a&gt; is found outside, battling more &lt;a href=\"Magic%20Anomaly\"&gt;magic anomalies&lt;/a&gt;. Talking to him reveals that &lt;a href=\"Mirabelle%20Ervine\"&gt;Mirabelle Ervine&lt;/a&gt; is dead, sacrificing herself to make sure everyone else escaped. This completes the quest and begins the next, \"&lt;a href=\"The%20Eye%20of%20Magnus\"&gt;The Eye of Magnus&lt;/a&gt;.\"\nMorokei dialogue.\nThe following remarks can be heard at intervals throughout the exploration of Labyrinthian. Each time Morokei speaks to the Dragonborn, the Dragonborn's magicka is completely drained by the experience."}

Variously known as standing stones or obelisks, they cannot be avoided in traveling the Shivering Isles, no matter how hard you might try.\nThere are many theories on the origin and purpose of these stones. (Purpose? Can a stone have a purpose? Is it a sentient being, or an inanimate object? Is it listening to you - watching you - whispering to you?). Some claim they are simply interesting geological formations. Not so. Not so. They cannot be chipped or cracked or even scorched. Believe me, I've tried. Nothing harms them. (Although perhaps they still feel the blows. They seemed angry for a while. I sang to them and that seemed to soothe them. I can't say why.) And if you've tried to dig one up, as I have, you know that they go down forever. (Months I spent, digging down. No matter how deep, there it was, still gleaming in the secret darkness beneath the earth. They know the secrets, even those that are buried deep.)\nI have spent many years trying to understand these stones. (Avoiding doesn't work. As I said, they're everywhere. So try for understanding, as I have. What is the humming? What do the whispers mean?) I can't say that I know everything about them, but I have learned many things, some of which I can share with you. (But I don't know what they want. Not yet. Perhaps if I knew what they wanted, I wouldn't be so afraid. They whisper secrets to me, but I promised not to tell. They know many secrets. They're always watching. They never sleep. Not even at night, in the dark of the moon.)\nI know they are old, older perhaps than the world itself. They have seen civilizations rise and fall. And they hate us. They are waiting for their &lt;a href=\"Jyggalag\"&gt;master&lt;/a&gt; to &lt;a href=\"Greymarch\"&gt;return&lt;/a&gt;. (They won't tell me who, or when. If they hate me so, why do they tell me their secrets? Is it because they know my secrets already?)\nYou may not believe me. Most don't, but most have not spent the time that I have in trying to learn about these stones. I have spent days listening to their secret whispers and learning their language. (They talk, you know. To each other, mostly. But now to me.) At first it was just a humming, which you can hear if you lean against a stone and listen very closely. It may take hours, or days, but you will hear them. And once you hear the voice of the standing stones, you will never be able to shut it out."}

She will tell you that the constellations of the Warrior, the Mage and the Thief have disappeared from the sky, and around the same time, Craglorn was attacked by beings calling themselves &lt;a href=\"Celestial\"&gt;Celestial&lt;/a&gt;s. These celestials call themselves &lt;a href=\"The%20Warrior%20%28Celestial%29\"&gt;The Warrior&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"The%20Mage%20%28Celestial%29\"&gt;The Mage&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"The%20Serpent%20%28Celestial%29\"&gt;The Serpent&lt;/a&gt;, after the constellations. The Thief, meanwhile, is nowhere to be found. \nHara will ask you to help out in this matter; to join her order. If you accept, she will ask that you partake in the rituals to formally join. Use the ritual circle in the center of the room; the Star-Gazers will recite the incantations to allow you into the order. Once they are done, you will be teleported to a room with no doors, where you will find &lt;a href=\"The%20Thief%20%28Celestial%29\"&gt;The Thief&lt;/a&gt;. Talk to her and she will tell you what is going on. She came to Tamriel along with the Warrior and the Mage when the Serpent broke free and started causing chaos, but the Warrior and the Mage were corrupted by the Serpent and now serve his will. The Serpent is also looking for her, so she can only indirectly aid you in your quest to stop him. \nAfter you are done talking, a portal will open up that will take you back to Belkarth. Talk to Hara here to finish the quest. She will tell you to ask around Belkarth to find out more about the Celestials and their whereabouts. "}

As a mother, my only wish is that you may help Narlindri recover as soon as possible. I fear he has not slept in days, so he most likely will not be able to answer your questions. I hope my account will be sufficient for your needs.\nUpon further inspection, we still are unsure of who gifted &lt;a href=\"Narlindril\"&gt;Narlindril&lt;/a&gt; the lute. He just turned twelve, and the celebration banquet had a great deal of guests and presents. I fear that we'll never found out, given my son's current state. Now I can see that it was most obviously a trap.\nThe lute was beautiful, and Narlindril took to it right away. That very night he began to attempt the first song which came with the accompanying music book. At first I thought him merely diligent, but as the night wore on I grew tired of the noise. When I told him to cease, he refused to meet my eye and simply kept playing. No matter what I said, I couldn't get him to stop. Finally, I grabbed the lute from his hands, demanding he go to his room for the evening.\nHe didn't say anything at first, but began to tremble. His entire body, shaking all at once. Then he fell to the ground in anguish, his limbs convulsing. He cried out, \"Mother! Please, give me the lute!\" his voice pained, as if he was being tortured.\nOf course I gave him back the lute, fearful for my son's life. He hasn't stopped playing since, and we're reaching our third day. Our family's healers haven't left his side, but it pains me to see his fingers cut and bleed. He hasn't slept, he barely drinks and eats, and always he plays that cursed lute.\nMy husband will accompany Narlindril on his journey, and can answer any further questions you have. Please, if anything can be done, our family will owe you a great debt. No cost is too great for the life of our only son.\nReverently yours,\nKinlady Lairilcilwe"}

At some point one of the locals will reveal that the thief is from another town, although there is a chance that they will lie, a fact proven by their incorrect description. Once the correct town has been named, the Agent must head to the location.\nRelic Retrieval.\nAfter arriving at the thief's home town, the Agent will have to ask around again to find the house that the thief is using. Upon entering the house the Agent must then speak with the thief, who will hand the item back to them, before calling for his associates. The Agent must escape the house once they spawn, although they are free to kill the thief's friends.\nOnce clear, the Agent must return to the Missionary and hand them the relic before the time limit ends to complete the quest.\nRewards.\nAlthough there is no physical reward for completing the quest, the Agent will get either positive or negative reputation gains depending on success or failure:"}

I've been asked to help the stormwardens defend the sphere until reinforcements arrive.\"\nWalkthrough.\nWhen approaching the &lt;a href=\"Ilayas%20Ruins\"&gt;Ilayas Ruins&lt;/a&gt;, you will encounter a woman named Mariel the Ironhand. She will tell you that &lt;a href=\"Sea%20Vipers\"&gt;Sea Vipers&lt;/a&gt; have invaded this place, looking for something called a Sphere of Storms, which the Bosmer use to defend the coast here. They have something called the Sky-Key in their camp, which allows them to enter the ruins. Mariel will ask you to retrieve this key before the vipers do any harm with it. \nHead into the enemy camp; the chest containing the key will be in the biggest tent. Once you have it, head to the ruins' entrance to the north, and meet up with Mariel there. She has been injured by one of the sea vipers and therefore cannot accompany you into the ruins, so she will task you with heading in and bringing the sky-key to the &lt;a href=\"Stormwardens\"&gt;Stormwardens&lt;/a&gt;. You can persuade her to give the solution to one of the puzzles you will have to solve to reach them. Head in and proceed through the ruins until you reach the westernmost of two square rooms in the south. In that room, you will find the bodies of a bunch of Maormer lying on the ground, with strange blue lights above them. The puxxle Mariel mentioned is also here; on the central pillar, you must activate the panels with &lt;a href=\"The%20Tower%20%28Birthsign%29\"&gt;The Tower&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"The%20Shadow\"&gt;The Shadow&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"The%20Lover%20%28Birthsign%29\"&gt;The Lover&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"The%20Thief%20%28Birthsign%29\"&gt;The Thief&lt;/a&gt; birthsigns, in that order. \nSuccesfully completing the puzzle will allow you to open the door to the east, by using the button next to the door. This is where the Stormwardens have fortified themselves. Talk to &lt;a href=\"Stormwarden%20Cirnean\"&gt;Stormwarden Cirnean&lt;/a&gt; and she will tell you that they were betrayed by one of their own; a man named &lt;a href=\"Firras\"&gt;Firras&lt;/a&gt;. She will also tell you that the power of the Sphere of Storms is waning, and that it needs to be recharged using thunderstones harvested from &lt;a href=\"Storm%20Atronach%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Storm Atronachs&lt;/a&gt;. You can find these in the big room in the east of the ruins. Upon entering this room, you will encounter a ghost called &lt;a href=\"Master%20Stormwarden%20Faranwe\"&gt;Master Stormwarden Faranwe&lt;/a&gt;. She was once the leader of the Stormwardens, back when they were of Ayleid stock. the recent draining of the Sphere has reawakened her as well as others of her order. She can be intimidated into protecting you from the other ghosts in the area; this will make the ghosts non-hostile as you seek out the Storm Atronachs. There are storm atronachs all around the room; kill at least two of them and take their thunderstones.\nOnce you have the thunderstones, place them in the receptacles in the west of the room, next to the door. Once you have done this, Master Stormwarden Faranwe will appear in front of the door, and tell you that the traitor Firras must die. Head through the door and you will find Firras with some sea vipers in the next room. Kill him, and Faranwe will appear by the ruins' exit. She will tell you that if you leave through the main exit, you will face an army of Sea Vipers, but there is a secret exit. Around the corner to your left, you will find a stone table; shove it aside to exit the ruins before the stormwardens use the sphere to seal off all entrances. \nOnce outside, talk to Mariel the Ironhand near the &lt;a href=\"Ilayas%20Ruins%20Wayshrine\"&gt;Ilayas Ruins Wayshrine&lt;/a&gt; to finish the quest."}

He made his original pile as a prospector, opening a series of profitable mines throughout the &lt;a href=\"Velothi%20Mountains\"&gt;Velothi Mountains&lt;/a&gt;. As the Stormcrag fortune and holdings grew, Ragnor invested in related businesses, including shipping, armor and weapon crafting, banking, and jewelry making.\nAs his long and successful life neared its end, Ragnor began a project to turn one of his mines into a crypt for his family. He didn't live to see the completion of the grand burial chambers, but he was interred in the deepest vault when the crypt was completed by his son, Agemor.\nThe Stormcrag family has produced business moguls, generals, priests, wizards, thanes, and other prominent individuals in every generation. Most were given a place of honor and reverence within the family crypt when their time came. Some lived long lives and died of natural causes, others fell much too soon, either to illness, accident, or battle. Then there was &lt;a href=\"Sorga%20Stormcrag\"&gt;Sorga Stormcrag&lt;/a&gt;.\nSorga was a wizard, a member of the &lt;a href=\"Mages%20Guild\"&gt;Mages Guild&lt;/a&gt;, who became obsessed with the accumulation of arcane power. When study and training failed to provide the power she sought, Sorga began to turn to more desperate measures. Some of these, the rumors reported, involved &lt;a href=\"Daedra\"&gt;Daedra&lt;/a&gt;.\nWhen the family matriarch of the time, &lt;a href=\"Koralla%20Stormcrag\"&gt;Koralla&lt;/a&gt;, heard about the dark path her niece had started down, she was furious. \"Nords do not deal with Daedra,\" she proclaimed. But Koralla's efforts to change Sorga's plans fell on deaf ears. Worse, the family began to hear tales of dark magic and murder associated with Sorga Stormcrag. That was all Koralla needed to hear.\nKoralla disowned Sorga, casting her out of the family and cutting off her access to the family fortune and her inheritance. She also declared that the family crypt would never hold the body of a Daedra-loving Nord.\n\"If the family crypt is off limits to me, then no Stormcrag will ever rest there again!\" Sorga declared. She placed a curse upon the tomb, making the dead rise and setting a &lt;a href=\"deathknight\"&gt;deathknight&lt;/a&gt; loose within the silent depths.\nTo this day, the curse remains in place, and no Stormcrags have been interred in the crypt since Sorga was disowned."}
{"id": "857863", "revid": "29733383", "url": "https://elderscrolls.fandom.com/wiki?curid=857863", "title": "The Stormfist Clan", "text": "The Stormfist Clan is a &lt;a href=\"Books%20%28Online%29\"&gt;book&lt;/a&gt; in .\nContents.\nThe clans of the &lt;a href=\"Nords%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Nords&lt;/a&gt; spread across &lt;a href=\"Skyrim%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Skyrim&lt;/a&gt; like herds of &lt;a href=\"Mammoth%20%28Online%29\"&gt;mammoths&lt;/a&gt;, though their numbers and influence upon the land are far greater. Each clan, however, makes its mark in a different way. Some clans are known for their hunting skills, or their forestry, or their crafting. Some clans are large, others small. Some take a prominent role in government and community. And then there are the dark clans. The clans no one deals with or even speaks of. One such clan is the infamous &lt;a href=\"Stormfist%20Clan\"&gt;Stormfists&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"Whiterun%20Hold%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Whiterun Tundra&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe clan traces its lineage to Ogra Stormfist, the powerful matriarch who founded the clan and ruled over it for almost fifty years. Highly regarded for their combat skills and armor crafting, the Stormfist clan played pivotal roles in numerous conflicts over the centuries, including the &lt;a href=\"Battle%20of%20Whiterun%20Hold\"&gt;Battle of Whiterun Hold&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"Massacre%20at%20Dialmarch\"&gt;Massacre at Dialmarch&lt;/a&gt;, and the &lt;a href=\"Siege%20of%20Windhelm\"&gt;Siege of Windhelm&lt;/a&gt;. It was the last engagement, however, that led to the clan's fall from favor and marked it as anathema.\nPrior to the &lt;a href=\"Second%20Akaviri%20Invasion\"&gt;Second Akaviri Invasion&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Fildgor%20Strong-Prince\"&gt;Fildgor Strong-Prince&lt;/a&gt;, son of &lt;a href=\"Queen%20Mabjaarn\"&gt;Queen Mabjaarn&lt;/a&gt; of Eastern Skyrim, went on a pilgrimage to the west to see the land and meet the people. He fell in with young men and women from the Stormfist clan and forged friendships and bonds that would serve him well in the coming years. When Fildgor was ready to move on and perform his coming-of-age trials, an entourage of Stormfist clan members decided to go with him. They became known as the Stormfist Brigade, and even though he wasn't a member of the clan by birth, Fildgor became their de facto leader.\nIf the Stormfist clan had a reputation prior to this, it paled in comparison to the legend that grew around the Stormfist Brigade. They were ferocious warriors, setting off for adventure in the most hostile and isolated areas of the kingdom. With Fildgor leading the way, they routed bandits, uncovered treasure, and slew monsters. When the &lt;a href=\"Akaviri\"&gt;Akaviri&lt;/a&gt; invaders arrived in force, Fildgor led the Brigade into the thick of battle. They eventually fought their way to &lt;a href=\"Windhelm%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Windhelm&lt;/a&gt; to join forces with Queen Mabjaarn and the main army.\nAlthough they weren't able to stop the fall of Windhelm or save the queen, the Stormfist Brigade was nonetheless instrumental in helping to route the invading army. They marched as part of the combined Nord forces that eventually joined with the &lt;a href=\"Dunmer%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Dark Elves&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Argonians%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Argonians&lt;/a&gt; to defeat the Akaviri. But then the fateful decision was made. When Fildgor declared his intention to ascend the throne left empty by his sister Nurnhilde's death, the Stormfist clan was among his most vocal backers. You know how that story ends. &lt;a href=\"Jorunn%20the%20Skald-King\"&gt;Jorunn&lt;/a&gt; and Fildgor met in single combat, and Jorunn won the throne. Fildgor was exiled, and he departed Skyrim with a promise to one day return.\nThe Stormfist clan, loyal to Fildgor to the end, refused to bow before Jorunn or acknowledge his authority over them. They returned to their holdings to the west, and King Jorunn, tired of all the fighting, let them go. To this day, the Stormfist clan remains isolated, rarely venturing out of its domain or taking part in the larger Nord community. What will happen if the clan ever decides leave its tundra-lands and reassert its place among the other clans is anyone's guess. Especially if Fildgor ever makes good on his promise."}

He fought the &lt;a href=\"Akaviri\"&gt;Akaviri&lt;/a&gt; slavetraders and single-handedly slew hundreds. Despite his valor, Lyrisius' army was routed and scattered to the four winds. Lyrisius fled into the moors to escape the Akaviri chariots.\nFar from the lands of men, Lyrisius entered the blasted lands. At the heart of this forsaken landscape, he met the wyrm. The great scaly beast mocked the mighty blows of Lyrisius' enchanted spear. It melted the shield &lt;a href=\"Fearstruck\"&gt;Fearstruck&lt;/a&gt;, gift of the &lt;a href=\"Daedra\"&gt;Daedra&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Boethiah\"&gt;Boethiah&lt;/a&gt;, with a single blast of its fiery breath. Lyrisius, seeing that he could not defeat the creature by force of arms, surrendered.\nThe wyrm intended to devour Lyrisius when the hero offered to be its slave and manservant. Ever prideful, the wyrm agreed. Seeing that the wyrm was vulnerable to conceit, Lyrisius spoke, \"Oh great wyrm. For my first service, I beg that you allow me to polish your one tarnished scale.\"\nIndeed, centered between the great wings of the creature was a dull scale, clearly out of reach of its long neck. Its vanity was such that it immediately lowered one wing for Lyrisius to climb upon.\nOnce astride the great lizard, Lyrisius slid his dagger underneath the scale and into the tender flesh of the beast. Though it spun and twisted in all directions, the wyrm could not get at the hero. Finally it took to the air. Lyrisius clung to the neck with all his strength as the wyrm banked, rolled, and dove.\nSeeing that Lyrisius could not be shaken free, the wyrm demanded that he remove the stinging blade. Lyrisius answered, \"Fly straight on until you see a great army. Destroy that army and I will remove my blade.\"\nWith a great roar, the scaled creature set off. The Akavari army had no chance against the fire-breathing beast. They have never plagued Tamriel since.\n\"I have done as you bid. Now sheath your stinger,\" roared the wyrm.\nKnowing that he would be devoured or worse, Lyrisius pulled the blade and then leapt from the back of the flying wyrm. Indeed, the foul monster had intended to slay the hero. The wyrm pursued the plummeting Lyrisius. Boethiah appeared beside the falling hero. Praising him for ultimately destroying the army of Akavir, she turned him into a raven. Lyrisius quickly lost the wyrm in the clouds.\nLegend has it that the wyrm still lives, though this happened in the first era long, long ago. The dragon nurses a grudge against Lyrisius and all of his kind. It has vowed never again to trust two legged bearers of weapons.\n\"Scholar's Note: If this legend has a basis in fact, the artifact Fearstruck was utterly destroyed. No other reference to it has ever been found.\""}

After many years King Rulthrub felt himself getting old, and started to think about what would happen to his realm after he was gone. Now this king was blessed with two sons, which normally would be a happy thing for an aging monarch, but in this case it was a problem. For the younger son who had been born of his queen, Prince Pigeon, was weak-willed and indifferent. In contrast the elder son, Prince Lancer, was bold and self-assured, and though his mother was of House Rithmat, the noblest in Cutcap, still Prince Lancer had undeniably been born out of wedlock.\nNow King Rulthrub was a wise king, and did not try to conceal that he favored his elder son, Prince Lancer, as he was clearly the prince most fit to rule. But nonetheless when the old king finally went to &lt;a href=\"Aetherius\"&gt;Aetherius&lt;/a&gt;, some people felt that the milksop Prince Pigeon should take the throne. I don't know whether these people were merely misguided, or had some other reason why they thought the rulership of Cutcap should be undermined. Fortunately wiser heads prevailed and Prince Lancer was elected King of Cutcap by the Council of Nobles.\nShortly after Lancer's accession to the throne he met a demoiselle named Lady Vespire at a ball and fell in love. The lovely and clever Vespire was a daughter of House Rithmat, and after a brief courtship King Lancer told his Council of Nobles that she would be his queen. However, Count Pigeon (the former prince) objected that this would not be proper as King Lancer's mother had been a Rithmat, and by the &lt;a href=\"Law%20of%20Consanguinity\"&gt;Law of Consanguinity&lt;/a&gt; the Lady Vespire was too close a relation for marriage. On this the rest of the council agreed, and King Lancer was persuaded to set the young lady aside. Upon hearing this news, Lady Vespire disappeared, said to have been carried off into the forests by a coterie of nixads, and though the king sent out search parties, his lost love was never found.\nIn due course the council recommended, for the sake of the dynasty, that King Lancer marry the young and healthy Lady Ignort of House Dull, and this, heartbroken, he agreed to. Lancer and Ignort were married, and King Lancer settled down to do his kingly duty by his new queen. Within a few months it was announced that Queen Ignort had borne King Lancer a child. A Naming-Day festival was declared for the infant princess, and everyone important in the realm was invited.\nOn the day of the celebration all the goodly and great of Cutcap came and laid presents at the foot of the cradle of Princess Arayelle, for thus she had been named. But at the end of the line came someone no one recognized: a dire Wyrd-&lt;a href=\"Hag%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Hag&lt;/a&gt;, hooded and cloaked, and bearing a darksome flower. Now, no Wyrd-Hags had been seen in Cutcap since the &lt;a href=\"1E%20668\"&gt;Year of Sun's-Death&lt;/a&gt;, but all feared her and none dared bar her passage.\nThe Wyrd-Hag advanced to the princess' cradle, and when she came to its foot she threw back her hood and cried, \"Behold, King Lancer! It is I, Lady Vespire, now a Wyress of the Wyrd!\" The gaily-clad crowd fell back in horror, for the formerly pretty Lady Vespire now sported a large nose disfigured by unsightly warts. \"By some oversight you failed to invite me to your daughter's Naming Day, but I have come nonetheless. And look\u2014I have brought the infant princess a present!\"\n\"What present is this?\" said King Lancer, all a-tremble. \"A darksome flower? I like not its look!\"\n\"That's no surprise, Your Majesty,\" said the Wyrd-Hag mockingly, \"for this is a &lt;a href=\"Forsaken%20Rose\"&gt;Forsaken Rose&lt;/a&gt;, a blossom no one wants! I know what that is like, King Lancer\u2014and so, by my curse, shall your daughter!\" The horrible Hag then dropped the misshapen bloom upon the baby and disappeared in a flash of fire and a cloud of evil-smelling smoke.\nSo it came to pass: Princess Arayelle grew up beautiful as a rose, but cross-grained and petulant. But she was nonetheless a princess of the north, so when King Emetick of the South came looking for a bride, their troth was quickly plighted.\nBut Count Pigeon had long made a habit of visiting the South, and was a boon companion of King Emetick. And he pointed out to the King of the South that Arayelle was cross-grained and petulant, and he might make a stronger match by marrying the Princess of Watchtower. In time Emetick agreed. He broke his match with Arayelle and promised himself to the Princess of Watchtower.\nKing Lancer, however, did not take this lightly, and swore he would go to war upon the oath-breaking King of the South. And he made lawful war upon King Emetick, but at the &lt;a href=\"Battle%20of%20the%20Tor\"&gt;Battle of the Tor&lt;/a&gt;, Lancer was betrayed by one of his own generals. King Lancer was slain, his crown and Princess Arayelle both disappeared, and ever since the Throne of Cutcap has stood empty.\nBut some say that when King Lancer was born a twin sister likewise saw the light of the world, but was spirited away by a Wyrd-Hag to be raised in the forests. And this child, a daughter of both Rulthrub and Rithmat, herself bore a daughter who was brought back to her maternal family. And this daughter was named Countess Eselde.\nAnd if the truth were told, all would know that her real title should be Princess Eselde. And she, and no other, is the rightful heir to the Throne of Cutcup. However, that is a tale for her people to tell."}

That is, until &lt;a href=\"Ja-Reet\"&gt;Ja-Reet&lt;/a&gt;.\nThough born in &lt;a href=\"slavery\"&gt;slavery&lt;/a&gt;, he's done well since the &lt;a href=\"Ebonheart%20Pact\"&gt;Pact&lt;/a&gt; and our emancipation. He even married a &lt;a href=\"Dunmer%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Dunmer&lt;/a&gt;\u2014the daughter of the &lt;a href=\"Narsis%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Narsis&lt;/a&gt; family who owned his parents. While I view such a union with personal distaste, it speaks well of his ability to interact in society despite his obvious disadvantage.\nMake no mistake, in Argonian society, he is disadvantaged. He's unable to read social clues, the subtle movements of muscle and tail that most of us take for granted. We occasionally have difficulty reading the emotions of other races. Ja-Reet has that problem even with fellow Argonians. He listens to spoken words, and is insensitive to their tone. Surely being born away from the Hist has deprived him of emotional intuition.\nHe brought his Elven wife with him to &lt;a href=\"Percolating%20Mire\"&gt;Percolating Mire&lt;/a&gt;. She's not welcomed by all, though she draws him out socially, which has been invaluable in trying to learn about how he thinks.\nPerhaps proximity to a thriving Hist tree will help Ja-Reet gain the intuition the rest of us take for granted."}

Modern scholars agree: there's just no reason for Ragnthar to exist in the strange way it does. And that is about all scholars can agree upon when it comes to the strange case of the Ragnthar ruins.\nEven laypeople know that the &lt;a href=\"Dwemer\"&gt;Dwemer&lt;/a&gt;, or Dwarves as they're more commonly known, vanished from the face of &lt;a href=\"Tamriel\"&gt;Tamriel&lt;/a&gt;. The reasons or cause behind their disappearance are a matter of much speculation \u2026 a subject for numerous other texts.\nWhat is not in dispute is what they left behind: numerous ruins, some still patrolled by their unique metal constructs. Exploring a Dwarven ruin is seen in many research and adventuring circles as a rite of passage, as even the most well-trod ruin might still contain dangers. As a result, there's a large body of work on the subject of Dwemeri ruins and their eccentricities.\nTo be sure, there are a number of unusual finds within the ancient Dwarven holdfasts. Towering machinery, shafts that allow sunlight to reach thousands of feet below ground, roaring waterfalls powering still-active and incomprehensible machinery ... there are many ruins that are stunning to the eye and the senses.\nNone of them match Ragnthar when it comes to stunning the mind. For you see, Ragnthar has numerous entrances spread across Tamriel. It is literally a space-out-of-space, twisted out of reality. Its physical location is actually unknown! Observations made within the site suggest it once was situated within the mountains of Hammerfell, but a precise origin point has never been determined.\nWhat is known is that by stepping across the threshold into Ragnthar, you leave &lt;a href=\"Nirn\"&gt;Nirn&lt;/a&gt;. And no one knows why.\nFor indeed, the greatest question posed by Ragnthar is: why? Why would the Dwemer expend the enormous amounts of magical energy required to remove a complex from known reality? I call this effort a \"&lt;a href=\"Temporospatial%20Claudication\"&gt;Temporospatial Claudication&lt;/a&gt;,\" literally a twisting of time and space.\nHerein you'll find this humble scholar's numerous observations about the site. I've extensively studied the remaining constructs and machinery here, as well as made numerous suppositions about the intent of its creators. I think you'll agree, the more we learn about the site, the more there is to uncover!"}

If spoken to, Narfi will ramble about the death of his parents and the departure of his sister, Reyda, whom he believes is still alive and will return. He mentions that Wilhelm, the innkeeper, said Reyda would come back.\nAfter talking to Narfi, enter &lt;a href=\"Vilemyr%20Inn\"&gt;Vilemyr Inn&lt;/a&gt; and speak to Wilhelm. He will tell the &lt;a href=\"Last%20Dragonborn\"&gt;Dragonborn&lt;/a&gt; that Reyda used to collect &lt;a href=\"Ingredients%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;ingredients&lt;/a&gt; on the small islands east of Ivarstead, mentioning &lt;a href=\"Geirmund%27s%20Hall%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Geirmund's Hall&lt;/a&gt; (which will mark it on the map, if it wasn't discovered already), and that she is most likely dead. This information can be extremely misleading, as Reyda's remains are not actually located on any of these islands. In fact, Reyda's remains are at the bottom of the river just southeast of Ivarstead, near the bridge. The Dragonborn may search for her remains by using the &lt;a href=\"Illusion%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Illusion&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Spells%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;spell&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Clairvoyance%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Clairvoyance&lt;/a&gt; (or simply by following the quest marker). Note that the &lt;a href=\"Detect%20Dead\"&gt;Detect Dead&lt;/a&gt; spell will not reveal the remains.\nNear her remains is a satchel containing some &lt;a href=\"Alchemy%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Alchemy&lt;/a&gt; ingredients, as well as her necklace. Bringing the necklace to Narfi will finish the quest. The Dragonborn will be rewarded with three random alchemical ingredients from a small list that includes items such as &lt;a href=\"Nirnroot%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Nirnroot&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Void%20Salts%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Void Salts&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Human%20Flesh%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Human Flesh&lt;/a&gt;, a &lt;a href=\"Human%20Heart%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Human Heart&lt;/a&gt;, a &lt;a href=\"Giant%27s%20Toe\"&gt;Giant's Toe&lt;/a&gt;, and a\u00a0&lt;a href=\"Daedra%20Heart%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Daedra Heart&lt;/a&gt;."}

The Agent must therefore destroy the skeleton and speak with the Merchant, and then return to the Guildmagister before the time limit expires.\nOf Mice and Bats.\nAfter the casting of the open spell, a notification appears, containing the details of a card left by the creator of the box. Along with it come a trio of &lt;a href=\"Giant%20Rat%20%28Daggerfall%29\"&gt;rats&lt;/a&gt; aided by a pair of &lt;a href=\"Giant%20Bat%20%28Daggerfall%29\"&gt;bats&lt;/a&gt;, which must be dealt with before the Agent can speak with the Merchant.

With nothing else to do, the Agent may speak with the Merchant before heading back to the Guildmagister to complete the quest.\nRewards.\nIf the box contained the wand the Agent will get to keep it. Otherwise, there will be no material reward for successfully completing the quest, although the Agent will receive the usual boost to their &lt;a href=\"reputation%20%28Daggerfall%29\"&gt;reputation&lt;/a&gt; within the Guild.

When kindled, it brings life to the &lt;a href=\"Dragonfires\"&gt;Dragonfires&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Imperial%20City%20%28Online%29\"&gt;the city&lt;/a&gt; above.\nThe Brazier's location is a closely guarded secret. Some say that Alessia's heirs can hear it calling to them through &lt;a href=\"Aethereal\"&gt;Aethereal&lt;/a&gt; \"songs.\" This belief has guided many misguided &lt;a href=\"souls\"&gt;souls&lt;/a&gt; into the &lt;a href=\"Imperial%20City%20Sewers%20%28Online%29\"&gt;sewers&lt;/a&gt;. The prideful and insane who believe themselves to be &lt;a href=\"Dragonborn\"&gt;Dragonborn&lt;/a&gt; descend into the underground, straight into the waiting jaws of many creatures that lurk there. But then, this may be the true purpose of the Brazier\u2014to test the strenght and guile of any person who would be &lt;a href=\"Emperor\"&gt;Emperor&lt;/a&gt;. The Imperial Sewers do not suffer fools. If you do not hear the songs, do not seek the Brazier."}

Take the letter out of the crate and bring it back to the Drake of Blades.

She will also tell you that while you were away, Father Egnatius deciphered the scroll Captain Caudex had; it details a ritual to make someone immortal and very powerful and bind them to the Dragonfire Cathedral. the Drake has volunteered for this, and Captain Caudex has begun preparing to defend the cathedral so that the ritual can take place. \nThe cathedral is located near your alliance's sewer base. If you are with the Ebonheart Pact, head out of your base, then west into the small square room and south into the room below that. If you are with the Daggerfall Covenant, . If you are with the Aldmeri Dominion, . When you arrive there, you will find that Malvius is already besieging the front door, but the key you found will allow for passage through the back door. Head inside and the ritual will start. The Daedra will need to be held back though, so you and Captain Caudex should head to the siege platform to the south and fight them off. Daedra will appear through the portals here; you will have to kill a grand total of 40 of them. You can use the ballistae here to fight them, but this is not necessary. Once this is done, a powerful Daedroth named the &lt;a href=\"Gate%20Crasher\"&gt;Gate Crasher&lt;/a&gt; will appear and burn the ballistae. Fight off this beast, then fall back to the Sublime Brazier itself. \nSeveral daedric portals will open in the room with the brazier, and you will have to fight off several waves of daedra, culminating in a fight with General Malvius himself. He is less powerful than the Daedroth though, so you should have little trouble with him. Once he is defeated, the ritual will be completed, and the Drake of Blades will destroy all the other incoming Daedra. Speak with her thereafter and she will thank you for all you have done to help and say her goodbyes. \nHead through the portal that has just appeared to return to your alliance base, then peak with Father Egnatius there to finish the quest and the questline as a whole.

He will tell you what all of this is about: he wants you to track down a serial killer. This killer always sends a threat in advance, hidden in a sweetroll. Reman will ask you to talk to the people who have recently received these sweetroll threats, and will give you a list of their names. \nThe closest one to the inn is &lt;a href=\"Yarmia\"&gt;Yarmia&lt;/a&gt;, near the city gates. she will get weirdly upset when you ask her some simple questions about the sweetroll, but you will not learn anything from her. She will then run away and throw apples to trip you if you give chase. Pursue her and she will lead you to &lt;a href=\"Razum-dar%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Razum-dar&lt;/a&gt;, telling him that you are the Sweetroll Killer. Speak with Raz and he will tell you that he is also investigating the matter, and that you should meet him in the enchanter's shop once you have finished your investigation. \n&lt;a href=\"Tuindal\"&gt;Tuindal&lt;/a&gt; can be found near the castle moat. He is a baker by trade, and has thus been accused of being the Sweetroll Killer himself. He does not seem too worried about the killer, as he figures he cannot avoid his fate. North from him in the market you will find &lt;a href=\"Dobias%20Sophus\"&gt;Dobias Sophus&lt;/a&gt;, who finds it strange that you even knew about his sweetroll as he never told anyone. He will tell you he did not get along with Reman Meravius very well, but will tell you nothing useful otherwise. \nFinally, talk to &lt;a href=\"Louna%20%28Dunmer%29\"&gt;Louna&lt;/a&gt;, in her yard east of the cathedral. She will also be surprised that you know about the sweetroll. She knows that Reman is investigating the murders, but she is suspicious about why he suddenly cares now, and did not care when the murderer killed her husband. The husband disappeared without a trace, not even leaving a drop of blood behind. \nOnce you have spoken to all your targets, head to Famula's Wonders and speak with Raz; he will be on the top floor. His plan is to track down the killer's messengers around town, so that they will hopefully lead you to the killer. In the meantime, Yarmia will stay here and hopefully not get murdered. Head outside and Raz will tell you he saw a messenger near the hedge maze to the west. The maze can be found behind the westernmost buildings; you can enter it from the north. Use your quest marker to avoid getting lost in the maze. You will find a \"&lt;a href=\"Suspicious%20Message\"&gt;Suspicious Message&lt;/a&gt;\" at the foot of a statue, which will contain coded language describing where the messengers are supposed to deliver their other messages. These locations are described as \"Wolf's Everlasting Stream,\" \"Perch Above the Sport Fighters,\" \"Eternal Knight\" and \"Where We Gaze Down On the Streets.\" If you do not want to bother figuring out these riddles, you can just walk around town until you see quest markers. \n\"Wolf's Everlasting Stream\" refers to the fountain north of the merchant stalls, west of the enchanter. You will find a \"&lt;a href=\"Soggy%20Note%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Soggy Note&lt;/a&gt;\" here describing why Dobias needs to be killed, code location: \"South of the Bank.\" \"Where We Gaze Down On the Streets\" refers to the bridge between Famula's Wonders and the Eight Blessings. This note is about the baker Tuindal, and will contain the code location \"East of the Cathedral\". \"Eternal Knight\" refers to the statue in the center of the Trader's Circle; there is a note behind it about Louna, claiming there is no evidence she was ever married at all. This one will contain the code location \"Inside the Building Where Three Paths Meet.\" Finally, head for the Arena spectator stands for the note on Yarmia, containing the code location \"Not on the Main Road.\"\nThe codes at the bottom of each of the notes can be used to determine where you should head next. If you take long to figure it out, Raz will decipher the clues for you and you just need to speak with him. Your target is the southernmost house in town, &lt;a href=\"Fermudh%27s%20House\"&gt;Fermudh's House&lt;/a&gt;. Inside the house, you will not find the killer, but rather &lt;a href=\"Naryu%20Virian%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Naryu Virian&lt;/a&gt;. Talk to her and she will tell you that those notes do not come from the Sweetroll Killer, but rather from her intelligence network. She has received one of the threatening sweetrolls, and has thus been tracking the killer as she does not take kindly to being threatened. \nNaryu has noticed that all of the targets are heading to Anvil soon, so she suspects the killer will strike there. She will suggest you and Raz meet her there. The meeting place is behind &lt;a href=\"Coastal%20Clothiers%20and%20Fabrics\"&gt;Coastal Clothiers and Fabrics&lt;/a&gt;; head there to meet with your allies. Once you arrive there, you will find that Yarmia has gone missing. Speak to Raz and he will tell you the plan. He and Naryu will find the other targets and try to keep them safe while you go and confront the man who hired you, Reman Meravius. Raz thinks he knows more than he is letting on. \nReman will be in the northwest of town, in the Gold Coast Trading Company. You will have to break in. You can find him badly injured on the balcony on the second floor, next to a note titled \"&lt;a href=\"Reman%27s%20Fortune\"&gt;Reman's Fortune&lt;/a&gt;\". Reman is dying; he has been backstabbed by the Sweetroll Killer. He will tell you everything; the Sweetroll Killer was working for him. He would point her at a target and she would kill them for him. But sending you on this investigation was his downfall. The killer was Louna; the moment you mentioned his name to her, she knew he had betrayed her and decided to stab him in the back. Louna has a farmhouse southeast of Anvil. \nTake this information to your allies in &lt;a href=\"Engra%27s%20Hostel\"&gt;Engra's Hostel&lt;/a&gt; west of the Mages Guild. They will join you in getting rid of the killer. Head out of anvil and follow the road east. When you arrive at the split in the road, take the south path. At the end of the road, you will find the farmhouse. Speak with Raz there and tell him you are ready to start the investigation. The moment the conversation ends, you will be set upon by several waves of Louna's goons. kill them all and Louna will tell you to come inside; she knows she has lost. \nInside, you will find Louna and the bodies of those Raz and Naryu could not save. Speak with her and she will tell you she is some sort of seer, and that all the people she kills would have caused disaster if she let them live. She will give you a choice: either you let her live and she gives you the antidote to save the people lying here, or you kill her and they die of the poison. Confer with your companions about this; Raz will advocate for letting her live while Naryu will advocate for killing her. After you have talked to them, speak with Louna again to make your choice. \nIf you opt to spare her, . If you kill her, head to Kvatch and speak with Naryu at he Inn to finish the quest."}

Members of the Synod meet in Synod Conclaves. It is said that both the College of Whispers and the Synod are more focused on politics, and thus guarding secrets, than actual teachings of magic.\nTeachings.\nThe Synod considers itself the Imperial Authority on magic. Research of both &lt;a href=\"Conjuration\"&gt;Conjuration&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Necromancy\"&gt;Necromancy&lt;/a&gt; is banned by the Synod.\nMembers of the Synod know a specific form of encrypted communication, in which regular Tamrielic letters are scrambled in the message, while some completely new symbols are also added in. There are also larger symbols, commonly representing spells, artifacts, and certain forms of energy. Once the way of communication is learned, it is said the code can be read effortlessly.\nHistory.\n&lt;a href=\"Fourth%20Era\"&gt;Fourth Era&lt;/a&gt;.\nFollowing the &lt;a href=\"Oblivion%20Crisis\"&gt;Oblivion Crisis&lt;/a&gt; and the chaos that followed it, the Mages Guild was disbanded. The Synod, alongside the &lt;a href=\"The%20College%20of%20Whispers\"&gt;College of Whispers&lt;/a&gt;, replaced the &lt;a href=\"Mages%20Guild\"&gt;Mages Guild&lt;/a&gt; in the early Fourth Era as the new Imperial sanctioned magical institutions.\n&lt;a href=\"Umbriel%20Crisis\"&gt;Umbriel Crisis&lt;/a&gt;.\n&lt;a href=\"Hierem\"&gt;Hierem&lt;/a&gt; held a great deal of influence in the Synod during the Umbriel Crisis of the Fourth Era, and was even considered the second most influential man in the Empire. The Synod would lend their magics to the Legion commanded by &lt;a href=\"General%20Takar\"&gt;General Takar&lt;/a&gt; when the flying city was headed for the &lt;a href=\"Imperial%20City\"&gt;Imperial City&lt;/a&gt;. Using their magical prowess, they cast levitation spells at some three thousands of Takar's Legionnaires. Due to &lt;a href=\"Daedra\"&gt;Daedra&lt;/a&gt; slaying most of these soldiers before they made it to the flying city, other magics were tried, but to no avail.\nWhile neither the Synod, nor the College of Whispers, ultimately brought an end to the Umbriel invasion, they were still granted the honor by the call of &lt;a href=\"Attrebus%20Mede\"&gt;Attrebus Mede&lt;/a&gt;, who saw their collaboration during the crisis as a positive feat which deserved to be celebrated.\n&lt;a href=\"4E%20201\"&gt;4E 201&lt;/a&gt;.\nIn 4E 201, and in the years leading up to it, both the College of Whispers and the Synod made inquiries in regards to the status of the College of Winterhold. Both also attempted to organize meetings with the College, but were denied at the direct order of its Arch-Mage, &lt;a href=\"Savos%20Aren\"&gt;Savos Aren&lt;/a&gt;, who questioned the motives for these requests. The College of Winterhold believed that either party was attempting to find supporters for their faction as opposed to the other. The College of Whispers desired to discover if the College of Winterhold was involved in research in Conjuration Magic or Necromancy, in order to prove that the political teachings of the Synod are a minority view.\nThe &lt;a href=\"College%20of%20Winterhold\"&gt;College of Winterhold&lt;/a&gt; considered the Synod to be consisting of harsh rules and a draconian structure, with suppression of opposition to the policies of its Council.\nSeveral months before the return of &lt;a href=\"Alduin\"&gt;Alduin&lt;/a&gt; the Synod had sought out the College of Winterhold again. This time, they were asking for information regarding the &lt;a href=\"Staff%20of%20Magnus\"&gt;Staff of Magnus&lt;/a&gt;. They asked &lt;a href=\"Mirabelle%20Ervine\"&gt;Mirabelle Ervine&lt;/a&gt; for information, though their line of questioning made her uneasy, and made her realise the Synod were looking for powerful artifacts in order to consolidate power.\nWhile they could not find the answers they sought from the College, they were convinced it was located within the province of &lt;a href=\"Skyrim\"&gt;Skyrim&lt;/a&gt;, and asked about the ruins of &lt;a href=\"Mzulft\"&gt;Mzulft&lt;/a&gt;, and decided to head there. Since then, the Synod is implied to somewhat regularly contact the College and ask them for any word on &lt;a href=\"Synod%20Researcher\"&gt;their researchers&lt;/a&gt;.\nExpedition to Mzulft.\nThe inspiration for the expedition to Mzulft was the &lt;a href=\"Orrery\"&gt;Orrery&lt;/a&gt; of the &lt;a href=\"Arcane%20University\"&gt;Arcane University&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Cyrodiil\"&gt;Cyrodiil&lt;/a&gt;. Whereas the Orrery projected the sky and the stars, the Oculory would project all of Tamriel in order to provide the Synod with the knowledge of locations of powerful magical artifacts.\nFollowing years of research, the Synod decided to send a research team to the ruins of Mzulft in order to use its Oculory. The Oculory could be used to discern the nature of the divine, collect starlight, and then split said starlight. By replacing one of the elements by a &lt;a href=\"Focusing%20Crystal\"&gt;Focusing Crystal&lt;/a&gt;, an item which took months of enchantments to get right, the Synod aimed to discover the power of the Oculory. The Crystal was designed in such a way that by either heating or cooling it the Crystal would either expand or contract, resulting in the light passing through it to change directions respectively.\nUpon the Crystal being attuned, however, the active presence of both the &lt;a href=\"Eye%20of%20Magnus\"&gt;Eye&lt;/a&gt; and Staff of Magnus greatly intervened in the project. While the Oculory was meant to depict the locations of many powerful artifacts, the great magical power radiating from these two artifacts blocked the others from coming through. After this conclusion, the &lt;a href=\"Imperial\"&gt;Imperial&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Paratus%20Decimius\"&gt;Paratus Decimius&lt;/a&gt;, who led the expedition and came up with the idea, decided to return to Cyrodiil and deliver a full report to the Grand Council in order to discover what was happening at the College at the time, and what it was that blocked the other artifacts from coming through."}

But it is the Emperor's ascent to godhood, as &lt;a href=\"Talos\"&gt;Talos&lt;/a&gt;, that is the subject of this work.\nUntil Tiber Septim's death, there had been &lt;a href=\"Nine%20Divines\"&gt;Eight Divines&lt;/a&gt;: &lt;a href=\"Akatosh\"&gt;Akatosh&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Dibella\"&gt;Dibella&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Arkay\"&gt;Arkay&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Zenithar\"&gt;Zenithar&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Stendarr\"&gt;Stendarr&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Mara\"&gt;Mara&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Kynareth\"&gt;Kynareth&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Julianos\"&gt;Julianos&lt;/a&gt;. These gods were, and are, worshipped throughout the Empire. And while some may have different names in the varying provinces (for example, Akatosh is known as \"Auri-El\" to the &lt;a href=\"Aldmer\"&gt;Aldmer&lt;/a&gt;; and Arkay is sometimes known as \"Ar'kay\"), all are recognized and revered by all races and cultures of &lt;a href=\"Tamriel\"&gt;Tamriel&lt;/a&gt;.\nBut when Tiber Septim passed to &lt;a href=\"Aetherius\"&gt;Aetherius&lt;/a&gt;, there came to be a Ninth Divine - Talos, also called &lt;a href=\"Ysmir\"&gt;Ysmir&lt;/a&gt;, the \"Dragon of the North.\" The man who was so loved in life became worshipped in death. Indeed, it can be argued that Talos, the Ninth Divine, became even more important than the Eight that had preceded him, at least to humans. For he was a god who was once just a man, and through great deeds actually managed to ascend to godhood. And if one human, could achieve such a feat - couldn't it be done again? Couldn't all humans aspire to achieve divinity?\nSo we thought, we humans. And so we continued to worship Talos, and revere him as the ultimate hero-god. But that was then. This is now. And now, we know the truth:\nWe were wrong.\nAs citizens of the Empire, we all experienced the sorrows of the &lt;a href=\"Great%20War\"&gt;Great War&lt;/a&gt;. And it was not until the signing of the &lt;a href=\"White-Gold%20Concordat\"&gt;White-Gold Concordat&lt;/a&gt;, the treaty between the Empire and the Aldmeri Dominion, that we once again knew peace. One of the most important stipulations of that treaty, as every &lt;a href=\"Imperials%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Imperial&lt;/a&gt; citizen is well aware, is that Talos can no longer be worshipped as a god. This edict shook the very foundations of the Empire. There were those who rebelled against the law. Indeed, some still do.\nBut the citizens of the Empire must know this: the Emperor did not agree to outlaw the worship of Talos because it was demanded by the &lt;a href=\"Thalmor%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Thalmor&lt;/a&gt;, the ruling body of the Aldmeri Dominion.\nThe Emperor agreed to the outlaw of the worship of Talos because it was the right thing to do.\nToday, the Emperor, and indeed the Empire itself, recognizes that allowing the worship of Talos was a mistake. For by doing so, by allowing the worship of Talos as a Divine the Empire actually did its own people a great disservice: for this only succeeded in weakening the memory of the man Tiber Septim and his many extraordinary (though mortal) deeds; and pushing people away from the Eight Divines, the true gods, who do deserve our love and reverence.\nAnd so, the Empire admits it was wrong. The Talos Mistake will not be repeated. May we find centuries of peace and prosperity with our new Thalmor friends, and continue to share a spirituality that binds together all the cultures and races of Tamriel."}

She has something planned inside Reachcliff Cave.\"\nWalkthrough.\nRumors in &lt;a href=\"Markarth%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Markarth&lt;/a&gt; say that the &lt;a href=\"Hall%20of%20the%20Dead\"&gt;Hall of the Dead&lt;/a&gt; has been closed, preventing the people from visiting their dead. &lt;a href=\"Brother%20Verulus\"&gt;Brother Verulus&lt;/a&gt;, a &lt;a href=\"Priest%20of%20Arkay\"&gt;Priest of Arkay&lt;/a&gt;, closed the hall because some of the bodies were defiled.\nRumors about the hall closing can be heard from &lt;a href=\"Kleppr\"&gt;Kleppr&lt;/a&gt; at the &lt;a href=\"Silver-Blood%20Inn\"&gt;Silver-Blood Inn&lt;/a&gt;. He will say that after closing the hall, Verulus has become rather unpopular around town, mostly with the &lt;a href=\"Nords%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Nord&lt;/a&gt; citizens who fear they are being purposely kept from their honored dead. If Kleppr refuses to divulge information, you can instead find Verulus yourself directly and he will update you about the circumstances.\nHall of the Dead.\nOn the way to the hall, &lt;a href=\"Thongvor%20Silver-Blood\"&gt;Thongvor Silver-Blood&lt;/a&gt; and Brother Verulus are accosting each other rather intensely. After the argument, both men will return to their normal routines and Verulus can be confronted. He will deny entrance to the Hall of the Dead but can be &lt;a href=\"Bribery\"&gt;bribed&lt;/a&gt;, persuaded or intimidated to explain the situation. He will explain that dead bodies in the hall have been found desecrated, and will permit the &lt;a href=\"Last%20Dragonborn\"&gt;Dragonborn&lt;/a&gt; to enter and investigate.\nInside, an unknown woman's voice will be heard talking to the Dragonborn, believing they have eaten flesh. Soon after, &lt;a href=\"Eola\"&gt;Eola&lt;/a&gt; will reveal herself. She reveals that she worships &lt;a href=\"Namira\"&gt;Namira&lt;/a&gt;, Lady of Decay, and is the one who has been eating the dead.\nThe Dragonborn can listen to what she has to say or confront and kill her. Listening to her and allowing her to leave will start the quest. Eola will become invisible, leave the Hall of the Dead and go to &lt;a href=\"Reachcliff%20Cave\"&gt;Reachcliff Cave&lt;/a&gt;, where she will wait for the Dragonborn. Alternatively, killing her will fail the quest immediately.\nEither way, the Dragonborn can report back to Brother Verulus and tell him that the Hall of the Dead is safe; Verulus will give the Dragonborn an &lt;a href=\"Amulet%20of%20Arkay\"&gt;Amulet of Arkay&lt;/a&gt; as a reward.\nReachcliff Cave.\nIf allowed to live, Eola will be waiting for the Dragonborn outside Reachcliff Cave, where she asks the Dragonborn to defeat the &lt;a href=\"Draugr%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Draugr&lt;/a&gt; inside. She will follow the Dragonborn in combat if asked.\nAfter the cave is cleared, Eola will thank the Dragonborn and propose a feast to celebrate the victory. She will ask the Dragonborn to lure Verulus into Reachcliff Cave to be eaten, as part of an initiation ritual. She will give 100 to cover expenses.\nOnce back in the Hall of the Dead, Verulus must be convinced to follow the Dragonborn to the cave through dialogue. Note that he cannot be asked to follow the Dragonborn if they already have a &lt;a href=\"Followers%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;follower&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe Feast.\nWhen the Dragonborn returns with Verulus, there will be a feast laid out in the final chamber, with other cannibals \u2013 &lt;a href=\"Sanyon%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Sanyon&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Lisbet\"&gt;Lisbet&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Banning\"&gt;Banning&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Nimphaneth\"&gt;Nimphaneth&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Hogni%20Red-Arm\"&gt;Hogni Red-Arm&lt;/a&gt; \u2013 seated around the large table. Eola talks to Verulus and convinces him to lay on the altar \"to rest\" before dinner starts.\nEola asks the Dragonborn to kill Verulus and feast on his flesh. After killing him and eating, the voice of Namira will sound, telling the Dragonborn she is pleased with them. She will grant them the &lt;a href=\"Ring%20of%20Namira%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Ring of Namira&lt;/a&gt;, which allows them to feed on dead human bodies, conferring +50 stamina and +50 health, and health regeneration that lasts for five minutes.\n\"Mortal. I am Namira, the Lady of Decay. Your consumption of the blood and bile of Arkay's own is pleasing to me. I give you my ring. Wear it. And when you feast on the flesh of the dead, I will grant you my power.\"\nAt any time before eating Verulus, it is possible to betray the members of &lt;a href=\"The%20Coven%20of%20Namira\"&gt;The Coven of Namira&lt;/a&gt; during the feast. This will cause the quest to fail; however, if Verulus survives, he will give the Dragonborn a leveled amount of gold and head back to Markarth. The dead coven members can also be looted for gold, keys, and other items.\nAlternate walkthrough: kill Eola.\nInstead of siding with Eola, the Dragonborn can simply kill her in the Hall of the Dead. Since she turns invisible immediately after the dialogue ends, it is easier to escape out of the dialog windows and attack immediately. A unique dialog option will then appear with Verulus: instead of saying \"The Hall of the Dead is safe,\" the Dragonborn will be able to say \"The cannibal has been dealt with.\" Verulus will thank the Dragonborn, but request they spare him the grisly details. This is also the only way to betray Namira's Coven without them becoming hostile, though obviously the Ring of Namira cannot be obtained this way. The Dragonborn will get an &lt;a href=\"Amulet%20of%20Arkay\"&gt;Amulet of Arkay&lt;/a&gt; from Verulus as a reward."}

She is also searching the Temple of Miraak, looking for answers. We've agreed that we need to find where Miraak's power is coming from.\"\nWalkthrough.\nThe Skaal Shaman.\nThe quest begins at the &lt;a href=\"Temple%20of%20Miraak\"&gt;Temple of Miraak&lt;/a&gt;. On the way, the power of &lt;a href=\"Miraak\"&gt;Miraak&lt;/a&gt; becomes apparent as the skeletal remains of many dragons can be seen scattered around the outskirts of the temple. In addition, several enthralled people under Miraak's spell can be found around the exterior, rebuilding the temple. This quest can effectively be started without completing the quest \"&lt;a href=\"Dragonborn%20%28Quest%29\"&gt;Dragonborn&lt;/a&gt;.\" This is done by releasing the &lt;a href=\"Skaal\"&gt;Skaal&lt;/a&gt; from their work at the Stone closest to their village, and then talking to &lt;a href=\"Storn%20Crag-Strider\"&gt;Storn Crag-Strider&lt;/a&gt;. He will direct the Dragonborn to find his daughter, &lt;a href=\"Frea\"&gt;Frea&lt;/a&gt;.\nUpon reaching the temple grounds, a Skaal woman named Frea will be trying, unsuccessfully, to free her spellbound kin from Miraak's influence. She explains her ability to resist Miraak's influence lies in &lt;a href=\"Skaal%20Amulet\"&gt;an amulet&lt;/a&gt; that she carved for herself.\nShe will also mention that her father, the Skaal shaman, is protecting the remaining Skaal in their village with a magical barrier:\n\"You must fight against what is controlling you! We must leave this place! Ysra, can you hear me? You must leave this place!\"\n\"You there. What brings you to this place. Why are you here?\"\nDuring the conversation, two &lt;a href=\"Cultist\"&gt;Cultist&lt;/a&gt;s will attack. Once they are dealt with, the quest continues by following Frea down the long winding ramp into the temple. &lt;a href=\"Draugr%20Deathlord%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Draugr Deathlords&lt;/a&gt; And &lt;a href=\"Draugr%20Death%20Overlord\"&gt;Death Overlords&lt;/a&gt; can spawn here, even at a low level.\nThe Temple of Miraak.\nUpon entering the temple, she will mention to look in the nearby rooms for anything useful. There are four rooms, two on either side of the passage. The first room to the left (west) has a bowl in an alcove of the south wall that contains several gems. The second room on the left contains leveled potions and a chest. At the north end of the corridor, the corridor turns left to a doorway that leads to a room with a pressure plate on the ground that will release poison darts. Two cultists will emerge at this point, and there are crypts on either side that each contain a &lt;a href=\"Draugr%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;draugr&lt;/a&gt;. After they are defeated, the path continues down the stairs to the west and into a smaller room. Frea warns to be careful as traps can be anywhere. She also reveals some more information about Miraak: \"Miraak was trying to take power here, and protect himself in the process.\"\nThe path continues north to a small passage with two pressure plates on the floor. At the north end, a set of stairs goes down to the left (west) and leads to a large closed gate with a pull chain to the right that opens it.\nThere is now a large chamber with several cages hanging from the center of the chamber. Frea walks over to the guardrail and remarks: \"I do not wish to imagine the kinds of things that happened in this chamber. Who were these poor souls trapped in these cages? What tortures did they suffer at Miraak's hands? Was it in service to the dragons, or for his own purposes?\" She then notices a higher balcony area to the right and remarks that the stairs are knocked out, however she is confident the Dragonborn can find a way up.\nProceeding south, then west, and then north around the pit in the center of the room, there are two sarcophagi that will burst open. Once the draugr that emerge are defeated, there is a large diagonal beam that leads to the roof. It is possible to jump on top of the beam from the northwest corner of the room (past the sarcophagi and underneath the beam itself). At that point it is possible to walk up it, then jump off the left to reach the upper balcony area Frea mentioned. Up here is a throne overlooking the chamber and a chest with leveled loot.\nHeading downstairs into the pit, more cultists will appear. The passageway leads to a gate that can be opened by activating the handle on the left. Beyond the gate, the passageway leads generally northeast to more crypts and sleeping draugr.\nEventually the tunnels lead to a swinging spike door trap. Here, the draugr will likely converge and attack, activating the trap themselves and causing some self-inflicted damage. At the same time, a battering ram may fall causing additional damage.\nBoth the upper (right) and lower (left) paths eventually lead to a pair of double doors (a chest is found on the upper path). Just before the doors, the floor has a pressure plate that causes jets of fire to erupt from the side. Beyond this pair of doors are several swinging pendulum axe blades. Frea comments that if would be foolish for her to try and make it past, so she elects to wait. It is possible to pass through the three sets of blades using &lt;a href=\"Whirlwind%20Sprint\"&gt;Whirlwind Sprint&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Become%20Ethereal\"&gt;Become Ethereal&lt;/a&gt;, or just dodging past them, until a lever is reached. Activating the lever to the right of the gate will open it and deactivate the swinging axe blades. Frea will now follow and thank the Dragonborn, saying that she hopes this is the last of the traps. There are pieces of what appears to have been a &lt;a href=\"Dragon%20Claws%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Dragon Claw&lt;/a&gt; door on the floor, indicating someone used brute force to take down the door without the use of a Dragon Claw to unlock it.\nContinuing down the passageway to the west, it turns south to another pair of doors. Beyond the doors and to the left, just past the rubble, is a chain that opens a secret door which leads to a room with a chest and multiple soul gems, several possibly black. Back in the main passageway, a window with an iron grating can be seen ahead. To the right (west) is a closed iron gate. The path continues on to the left (south), then east, and eventually arrives at a handle that was visible through the grate before. Activating the handle will raise the iron gate beyond. A wooden bridge beyond the gate will fall and create a ramp leading down. Immediately at the end of the ramp is a pressure plate that triggers a poison dart trap.\nUpon entering this area, three more bridges on the far side of the chamber will fall, unmasking two draugr and a boss level Cultist. After they are defeated, the double doors can be used to enter the Temple of Miraak Sanctum.\nTemple of Miraak Sanctum.\nUpon entering the sanctum, Frea comments \"I do not know what it is Miraak learned that gave him reason to turn on his masters. But his path seems to have been a cruel one. I wonder if we will find some answers to what happened so long ago.\"\nThe long caged corridor to the west has six skeletons lurking at the end. The passageway turns left, where some draugr will emerge from their sarcophagi, as well as two battering rams. Proceeding further, the path leads to a broken caged-in path, then turns left (east). Frea notices a caved in floor section and mentions there might be something of note down there. Down the crevice, a tunnel leads right (south), up some stairs, then turns right (west). To the right (north) of this path is a small room containing two spell tomes for &lt;a href=\"Reanimate%20Corpse\"&gt;Reanimate Corpse&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Magelight%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Magelight&lt;/a&gt;, multiple soul gems, and some potions. The tunnel ends just a bit farther on.\nBack at the tunnel entrance, the path leads under the caged corridor from earlier. There are two more cultists here. Across the upper pathway on the right (against the east wall), the path turns west, where stairs lead deeper into the ruin. Frea comments: \"How much deeper can this be? I have been told that Miraak's power was great, but to have built so large a temple...It cannot be much farther now. I feel it in my bones.\"\nThe path leads to a smaller room lined with sarcophagi and the skeleton of a dragon hanging from the ceiling as a trophy. There is also a &lt;a href=\"Word%20Walls%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Word Wall&lt;/a&gt; here containing a Word of Power for Dragon Aspect. Frea comments: \"I had heard Miraak has turned against the Dragon Cult, but to display the remains in such a manner as this... It is no wonder the dragons razed his temple to the ground. Seeing the remains hung up like trophies must have enraged them to no end.\"\nReading the word wall will awaken the draugr resting in the sarcophagi. One particular draugr, called the &lt;a href=\"Gatekeeper%20%28Dragonborn%29\"&gt;Gatekeeper&lt;/a&gt;, holds a key that will unlock the iron door that lies inside his sarcophagus. Once they have been defeated, opening the door leads into a meeting room of sorts with several long dead occupants still seated. The next set of doors to the west lead to a dining area.\nA passageway in the northwest corner of the room leads to a kitchen area. There are several potions and ingredients. Upon entering, Frea will exclaim that this looks like a dead end, but that there must be something else, so she encourages the Dragonborn to keep looking. In the southeast corner of the room is an &lt;a href=\"Alchemy%20Lab%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Alchemy Lab&lt;/a&gt; and a small tunnel that leads to a handle. Activating the handle will open the secret passage in the dining area. Frea will announce that the secret passage has been found.\nThe secret passage leads south through a tunnel to reach a circular room. Frea walks over to a ruined book and remarks: \"I wonder if there is something here that tells the story of Miraak...\" she then walks into a side room decorated with three &lt;a href=\"Lurker\"&gt;Lurker&lt;/a&gt; busts and remarks: \"I do not recognize this statuary. We passed a few of them earlier, but they are becoming more frequent as we get further in. I do not like this place. It almost looks as if these statues will come to life at any moment.\" She then notices the handle in front of the heads and remarks: \"I'll leave the honor of pulling that handle to you. I do not want to put my hand anywhere near the mouth of that statue.\"\nActivating the handle opens the gate on the floor in the same room. Down the spiral staircase, across (east) to another wooden spiral staircase, and past some more odd statuary is another handle that activates a hidden stairwell. A spiral staircase leads down to a wooden door.\nThrough the wooden door is a large chamber with several traditional Nordic archways and more unfamiliar Lurker statuary. Multiple draugr and skeletons are defending the place, and there are tripwire-rigged falling boulders. Eventually, a large statue of a &lt;a href=\"Hermaeus%20Mora%20%28Dragonborn%29\"&gt;crab-like creature&lt;/a&gt; is reached, under which a master level chest is found.\nA chain located behind the statue at the end of the chamber can be pulled, which opens another hidden door. The tunnels can be followed to reach a circular room unlike anything else that has been encountered before. The Black Book \"\" is sitting on a pedestal and Frea comments: \"This book... it seems wrong, somehow. Here, yet... not. It may be what we seek.\"\nBlack Book: Waking Dreams.\nReading the book causes a tentacle to appear and ensnare the Dragonborn, transporting them to &lt;a href=\"Hermaeus%20Mora\"&gt;Hermaeus Mora&lt;/a&gt;'s realm, &lt;a href=\"Apocrypha\"&gt;Apocrypha&lt;/a&gt;. Upon arrival, the Dragonborn is forced onto their knees and confronted by Miraak, who remarks: \"Who are you to dare set foot here? Ahh... You are Dragonborn. I can feel it. And yet...\"\nNext he will comment about the Dragonborn's prowess against dragons, however his statement depends on how many dragons the Dragonborn has slain prior to the quest:\nAfter one of these statements, he demonstrates all three words of the Dragon Aspect shout: \"You have no idea of the true power a Dragonborn can wield! Mul... Qah Div! This realm is beyond you. You have no power here. And it is only a matter of time before Solstheim is also mine. I already control the minds of its people. Soon they will finish building my temple, and I can return home.\"\nHe then instructs two &lt;a href=\"Seeker\"&gt;Seeker&lt;/a&gt;s under his command to send the Dragonborn back to Solstheim, and proceeds to ride away on his dragon, &lt;a href=\"Sahrotaar\"&gt;Sahrotaar&lt;/a&gt;, saying, \"Send him/her back where he/she came from. He/She can await my arrival with the rest of Tamriel.\"\nThe Seekers continually cast waves of magic over the Dragonborn until the screen fades out and they are transported back to the temple. Frea then suggests that they head to the &lt;a href=\"Skaal%20Village%20%28Dragonborn%29\"&gt;Skaal Village&lt;/a&gt; and speak with her father and village shaman, Storn Crag-Strider. After this the quest is complete, the next quest, \"&lt;a href=\"The%20Fate%20of%20the%20Skaal\"&gt;The Fate of the Skaal&lt;/a&gt;,\" begins."}

Others say worse things. But the &lt;a href=\"Ternion%20Monks\"&gt;Ternion Monks&lt;/a&gt; carry on a tradition that honors the Three Old Gods and the totems associated with them. While the religion is ancient, its followers are few. In many respects, the Ternion movement is slowly dying, as very little proselytizing takes place by the current contingent of monks. Fewer and fewer converts take up the worship of the Three Old Gods, and soon the religion may become nothing but a vague memory.\nKnown for their healing magic, the Ternion Monks can call forth aspects of the Three Old Gods. With the help of these aspects, the monks can perform tasks beyond the scope of mere mortal limitations. The aspects take the forms of the Three Old Gods: the Fox, the Bear, and the Wolf.\nThe Fox is crafty and quick, and its aspect enhances the speed and agility of the monks who call upon him.\nThe Bear is strong, mighty. A protector. The aspect of the Bear enhances strength and shields those who call upon him from harm.\nThe Wolf is sly and observant, ferocious and deadly. She watches and waits, looking for the best opportunity to make her move. The aspect of the Wolf enhances vision and perception, allowing those who call upon her to see more clearly, to notice the hidden and the obscure.\nThe Ternion Monks prefer nigh-inaccessible spots as places to meditate and worship. Often, the only way to get to these holy retreats is to use the magic of the monks. A guardian is always appointed to open the way to the retreat, but will only do so for other monks or if the need is great and the requester is worthy.\nI have spent time with the monks, learned something of their ways and seen their healing magic in action. I believe that they are good people, following a worthy tradition. But I fear that when this generation comes to an end, the Ternion Monks and the Three Old Gods they worship will fade away.\nAnd that will be a sad day, indeed."}

When spoken to directly, Golena Sadri will shout disconnected and incomprehensible phrases, thus starting the quest. After that, when the Nerevarine talks to Alvan Llarys, he will state that she has been in this condition for months now, and that any attempt to discuss it with her as ended badly. They even feel it is necessary to bring a &lt;a href=\"High%20Ordinator\"&gt;High Ordinator&lt;/a&gt; with them for security, whenever they visit their mutual friend.\nWalkthrough.\nWhen returning to Alvan Llarys after speaking to Golena Sadri, he remembers that Golena has visited Elbert Nermarc lately. Alvan thinks this Elbert might know something about Golena's condition. He says he would ask him himself, but he feels he should stay back and try to comfort Golena Sadri.\nElbert Nermarc can be found at the &lt;a href=\"Craftsmen%27s%20Hall\"&gt;Craftsmen's Hall&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Godsreach\"&gt;Godsreach&lt;/a&gt;. When spoken to about \"Golena Sadri\", he reacts scared that he might be urged to talk to her. He then tells the Nerevarine an intriguing story about her: She seems to have visited him regularly for some time, always asking him details about enchanting certain objects. One day she asked him to come to her manor and help her with something. Elbert claims that she had a number of strange devices there, of a sort he has never seen before, possibly of &lt;a href=\"Dwemer%20Artifacts\"&gt;Dwemer&lt;/a&gt; origin. Upon examining one of them, it shocked him. Elbert claims that in that instance, Golena turned mad, laughing maniacally, then chasing him from the manor accusing him of attempted theft and being a spy. He hasn't seen her since.\nWhen returning the Nerevarine encounters Alvan Llarys outside Sadri Manor. In panic he tells them that he had just stepped out for a bit of fresh air, when the door was locked behind him and he heard screams from within. It seems clear that they must enter the manor as fast as possible.\nThe door is locked on level 90. The Nerevarine can either attempt to &lt;a href=\"Lockpick%20%28Morrowind%29\"&gt;pick the lock&lt;/a&gt; or use a &lt;a href=\"Scroll%20of%20Ekash%27s%20Lock%20Splitter\"&gt;Scroll of Ekash's Lock Splitter&lt;/a&gt;, which can be bought from Elbert Nermarc. Once inside, the Nerevarine finds nobody but for the guard, who lies dead on the floor. There is a trapdoor leading into the &lt;a href=\"Residential%20Sewers\"&gt;Residential Sewers&lt;/a&gt; beneath the manor. The dead body of Tadera Andules lies down here."}

On his way out, he spied the killing word of the Spider, the &lt;a href=\"Ebony%20Blade\"&gt;black edge of shadow&lt;/a&gt;, and claimed it, as well. So swift were these takings that the Anticipation of Vivec was unaware anything went missing. Dark and sharp was the anger that followed, but Rajhin was no longer there. Rajhin is not cruel, or malicious\u2014sometimes, when the Moons fit his mood, he gives them back.\nFrom the Webspinner's threads, Rajhin found his way to &lt;a href=\"Apocrypha\"&gt;a land where all trees have fallen&lt;/a&gt;, and the only currency is knowledge. There, Rajhin pillaged the &lt;a href=\"Oghma%20Infinium\"&gt;Book that Knows&lt;/a&gt; from the one who &lt;a href=\"Hermaeus%20Mora%20%28Online%29\"&gt;knows it all&lt;/a&gt; and disappeared amongst sheaves in the wind. The lord of that land has never stopped seeking his treasured volume, and, sometimes, when the Moons are right\u2014he finds it. Because, sometimes, Rajhin gives it back.\nThey say that, eventually, Rajhin took too much, too often, that the Ring of Khajiit tired of his capers. They say that the Ring abandoned Rajhin as he was surrounded by enemies, that it was his undoing. This one knows that Rajhin simply gave the Ring back."}

He will become angry that the &lt;a href=\"Blades%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Blades&lt;/a&gt; are involved and if the incorrect dialogue option is chosen he will refuse to help. At this point &lt;a href=\"Einarth\"&gt;Einarth&lt;/a&gt; will speak in a voice that echoes around the building:\nArngeir will apologize and mention Einarth reminded him of his duty. He will teach the Clear Skies Shout. From the courtyard, follow the path up the steps. The path will continue into some bad weather; use the Clear Skies Shout to clear the mist and continue to the Throat of the World to meet Paarthurnax. There is a &lt;a href=\"Frost%20Troll%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;frost troll&lt;/a&gt; and some &lt;a href=\"Ice%20Wraith%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;ice wraiths&lt;/a&gt; along the way.\nBefore learning about &lt;a href=\"Dragonrend\"&gt;Dragonrend&lt;/a&gt;, Paarthurnax will offer to teach a word of the &lt;a href=\"Fire%20Breath%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Fire Breath&lt;/a&gt;\u00a0Shout. Paarthurnax will use the Fire Breath Shout at the nearby Word Wall, allowing the Dragonborn to acquire a word of the Shout.\nWhile speaking with Paarthurnax, it is learned that no dragon can use Dragonrend, because it was the first Thu'um made by mortals and the concept of mortality is beyond their understanding. According to Arngeir, the Shout was made entirely with hatred for dragons - by those who suffered the slavery of &lt;a href=\"Alduin%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Alduin&lt;/a&gt;. Learning the word would mean taking part in the hatred that created them as well.\nIn addition, Paarthurnax allows the Dragonborn to &lt;a href=\"Meditations%20on%20the%20Words%20of%20Power\"&gt;Meditate on the Words of Power&lt;/a&gt;, adding bonus effects to Shouts and the Dragonborn.\nPaarthurnax reveals that Alduin was first defeated using the Dragonrend Shout, but not without the aid of an &lt;a href=\"Elder%20Scroll%20%28Dragon%29\"&gt;Elder Scroll&lt;/a&gt;. After Dragonrend was used, the Elder Scroll was used on Alduin to cast him on to the tides of time. However, Alduin was simply sent forward. Since that day, Paarthurnax has remained at the point where time was shattered. He stayed there, waiting thousands of years for Alduin to appear once more.\nFrom here the next task is to find an Elder Scroll, though Paarthurnax does not know where it may be. He suggests talking to either Arngeir or &lt;a href=\"Esbern_%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Esbern&lt;/a&gt;, both of whom will direct the Dragonborn to the &lt;a href=\"College%20of%20Winterhold%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;College of Winterhold&lt;/a&gt;."}

She will ask you to go in there and drive them back. \nHead into the storage cellar and defeat several waves of undead. Eventually, their leader, the worm cultist &lt;a href=\"Falkyn%20Milkeye\"&gt;Falkyn Milkeye&lt;/a&gt; will appear. Once he is dead, head back out. Hallfrida will come running towards you; something has happened to &lt;a href=\"Thane%20Unnvald%20Ironhand\"&gt;the thane&lt;/a&gt;. Speak with her and she will tell you that Thorulf raised a skeleton inside the manor and claimed the undead were inside, which made the Thane go mad; he might do serious harm to himself. Sjarakki then came in and told them that the undead were bing driven back, which caused Thorald to flee. You now have the choice to either go save the Thane or to go kill Thorulf. \nIf you choose to save the thane, \nIf you go after Thorulf, you will find him on the road halfway to &lt;a href=\"Trolhetta%20Wayshrine\"&gt;Trolhetta Wayshrine&lt;/a&gt;. Kill him, then return to Fullhelm and speak with Hallfrida. She will inform you that Thorulf left a shard of &lt;a href=\"Wuuthrad%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Wuuthrad&lt;/a&gt; behind, and she will ask you to keep Bonebane and wield it in battle. This will finish the quest. \nReward.\n&lt;a href=\"Bonebane\"&gt;Bonebane&lt;/a&gt;"}

While many were slain, there may be survivors.\"\nWalkthrough.\nIn the &lt;a href=\"Wilding%20Run\"&gt;Wilding Run&lt;/a&gt;, you will find a man named Nilaendril. He will tell you that his research group wasattacked by something, and that he is the only survivor. The &lt;a href=\"Fists%20of%20Thalmor\"&gt;Fists of Thalmor&lt;/a&gt; in the area were also attacked, but there might be survivors among them. Nilaendril will ask you to search for survivors. \nHead to the road northwest of the wayshrine. There, you will find a woman named &lt;a href=\"Corporal%20Brelinith\"&gt;Corporal Brelinith&lt;/a&gt;; speak with her and she will tell you that most of her compatriots are dead, but that she does not know where her or lieutenant are. She will also tell you that the things that attacked them were zombies. Brelinith will have a few ideas on where to look for her superiors; she will suggest the surveyor's camps around the area, as well as the ruins. \nYou will find them at the overlook in the northwest of the area. The lieutenant will be wounded on the ground, while Captain Trelano will be kneeling to a shade of &lt;a href=\"Ulthorn\"&gt;Ulthorn&lt;/a&gt;, the Hound. The lieutenant will tell you to stop the captain. Talk to the shade and he will tell you that Captain Trelano is trapped and will soon become one of the zombies. He will offer to take you to the place where Trelano's spirit is trapped. Accept, and you will be taken to &lt;a href=\"Hircine\"&gt;Hircine&lt;/a&gt;'s Plane of Oblivion, &lt;a href=\"The%20Hunting%20Grounds%20%28Malabal%20Tor%29\"&gt;The Hunting Grounds&lt;/a&gt;. Talk to the Shade here and he will tell you that he is a shade of who Ulthorn was before he became the Hound. This place is the prison where Hircine forged him into a loyal servant, though it has been repurposed by &lt;a href=\"Gamekeeper%20Ozzai\"&gt;Gamekeeper Ozzai&lt;/a&gt; to torment souls and turn their bodies into mindless husks that attack everyone. \nTo free Trelano from this prison, you must pass three barriers crafted from Ulthorn's memories. To pass the first barrier, you must pick one of three items on the table in front of you. The shade will tell you that he had a sense of humor in life, and that you should pick the humorous gift he gave &lt;a href=\"Gwaering\"&gt;Gwaering&lt;/a&gt;. The bone amulet is the correct choice here; once you tae it, you will see a scene from Ulthorn's memories where Gwaering sets off to &lt;a href=\"Silvenar%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Silvenar&lt;/a&gt; to heed the spinners' call. Head down the path and you will find another table with three items. The shade will tell you hat the object you must pick here is something Gwaering left behind when she left to become the Green Lady. The correct choice here is the bow; once you pick it up, you will see the memory where Gwaering tells Ulthorn that she is to be the new Green Lady. Proceed further and you will find a third table; the shade will tell you that he prayed to every known god for some way to alter the story and have him end up with Gwaering. The totem of Hircine is the correct answer here; you will see a scene of Gwaering rejecting Ulthorn over his new allegiance to Hircine, and giving him back the bone amulet. \nNow that all the barriers are down, head across the stream into the cave; in the deepest part, you will find Gamekeeper Ozzai tormenting Captain Trelano's spirit. Kill Ozzai, then talk to the shade again and he will send you back to Valenwood. Speak with Captain Trelano there to finish the quest."}

In these, they would bury the dead that did not survive the flight from the &lt;a href=\"Imperial%20City%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Imperial City&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe monarchs of the region, King Savlian of &lt;a href=\"Rimmen%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Rimmen&lt;/a&gt; and Queen Padala of the &lt;a href=\"Anequina\"&gt;Anequina&lt;/a&gt; Khajiit, decreed that the Akaviri survivors would be resettled within the capital and the fertile hills to the south. They brought with them many of their retainers, full-blooded &lt;a href=\"Imperials%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Imperials&lt;/a&gt; who were nevertheless devoted to their former rulers.\nThough Rimmen already had an eclectic society as a crossroads of Imperial and Khajiiti trade, the strange aesthetics, culture, and even food of the Akaviri settlers changed the city forever. The most unusual contribution of the Akaviri, if one can call it that, was the construction of the &lt;a href=\"Tonenaka%20Shrine\"&gt;Tonenaka Shrine&lt;/a&gt; in the northern district of Rimmen.\nBuilt with Khajiiti stonework influenced by Akaviri architectural styles, the Tonenaka Shrine became something of a cultural touchstone for the remaining Akaviri settlers and their former Imperial subjects. Their patriarchs commissioned the construction of ten thousand statuettes of carved stone, bringing sculptors and engineers from across southern &lt;a href=\"Tamriel\"&gt;Tamriel&lt;/a&gt; to aid in the project.\nIndeed, the vast wealth that these Akaviri settlers brought with them to finance the project greatly increased Rimmen's prosperity. However, as the years passed, so few of the Akaviri remained that only five lived to see the Shrine's completion. Most had interbred with the Imperial population or settled farther south in the village of &lt;a href=\"Hakoshae\"&gt;Hakoshae&lt;/a&gt;.\nWhen the final statue was placed, these five Akaviri entered the Tonenaka Shrine and sealed its doors behind them, placing powerful wards upon it to prevent entry. This wasn't part of the original agreement between the Rimmen authorities and the Akaviri builders, but with the promise of gold their ire was assuaged.\nThe Shrine remains sealed to this day, with only occasional work being done to its exterior to prevent degradation of its marvelous stonework."}

Nelanya's Retreat is to the north of the chief's lair; she will not be hostile. Talk to her and she will offer to explain what she has been doing. You can either kill her outright, or you can hear her out and then choose whether to kill or spare her She will explain that the Veiled Heritance are indeed duping the goblins here, because they feel like they are losing the war and they will use any means necessary.

Used by those ancient shamans in the blood ceremonies that created our lineage, it is said to grant a great presence to those who prostrate themselves before it, such that those who witness their forms cower in a terror unknown except to those who have glimpsed the face of Hircine himself.\nThe second: a thigh bone, carved as the skull, but from some animal unknown. Used as some form of medicinal wand in the more ancient brotherhood, it was said to grant a kind of heightened awareness, both in sight and smell, such that the prey could never flee too far from our senses.\nThe third: a simple drum, its mundane appearance meaning it is most likely lost to the mists of long ago time. As our fathers would beat time to summon their brethren from the fields, so too would our forebears in the blood call their allies to them with its pounding.\nThrough these totems, we channel and focus our energies of the beast. While werewolves give up the powers of magic known to men, we can tap into a more direct natural energy at times, and through these totems, discover the abilities that first tamed the world before wrought civilization sullied it."}

This secret was allegedly discovered by &lt;a href=\"Lorkhan\"&gt;Lorkhan&lt;/a&gt; during the creation of Mundus, and is claimed by &lt;a href=\"Vivec\"&gt;Vivec&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Mankar%20Camoran\"&gt;Mankar Camoran&lt;/a&gt; to be a pre-requisite for &lt;a href=\"CHIM\"&gt;CHIM&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe Tower as the Structure of the Aurbis.\nThe Aurbis is referred to by some as structured like a wheel, with \"the &lt;a href=\"Aedra\"&gt;Eight gift-limbs&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"SITHISIT\"&gt;SITHISIT&lt;/a&gt;\" as the spokes, and leaving &lt;a href=\"Daedra\"&gt;sixteen spaces&lt;/a&gt; between the spokes. When viewed sideways, this is the Tower, which is the Aurbis seen from the outside. This seems to be the case regardless of the state of the cosmos within the Wheel.\nThe Secret Tower.\nThe Triangular Gate is, according to \"Sermon 21\", held by the \"heart of the Serpent,\" likely a reference to Lorkhan. Due to its location within the heart of the Serpent and its connection to Lorkhan, the Secret Tower is likely to be within Mundus. This is reiterated in the \"&lt;a href=\"Commentaries%20on%20the%20Mysterium%20Xarxes\"&gt;Commentaries on the Mysterium Xarxes&lt;/a&gt;\", where Mankar Camoran states: \"First Tower Dictate: render the mutant bound where he may do no more harm. As God of the Mundus, alike shall be his progeny, split from their divine sparks. We are Eight time eight Exarchs. Let the home of Padomay see us as sole exit.\"\nThe ultimate secrete of the Secret Tower is that the self is divine, which is potentially the ultimate purpose and mirror of the structure of the Aurbis. This is also potentially the secret required for the attainment of &lt;a href=\"CHIM\"&gt;CHIM&lt;/a&gt;.\nMore information.\nThe exit spoken of implies that escape from Mundus is only possible through Mundus, that is, the Triangular Gate. It is also stated in other sources to be the \"circle within the circle,\" where the reflection of the universe's structure can be clearly seen. By this reasoning, it is impossible (or at least unlikely) for non-mortals to use the Walking Ways to Godhood which involve the Tower, because they do not view it from a place of confinement. Conversely, those with CHIM are described as \"[residing] within\" the Secret Tower.\nDue to the triangular nature of the gate, this is also possibly linked to the concept of the &lt;a href=\"Enantiomorph\"&gt;Enantiomorph&lt;/a&gt;, which involves three participants. The &lt;a href=\"Thief%20%28Birthsign%29\"&gt;Thief&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"The%20Tower%20%28Constellation%29\"&gt;Tower&lt;/a&gt; are connected to this when &lt;a href=\"Hasphat%20Antabolis\"&gt;Hasphat Antabolis&lt;/a&gt; claims that, \"The Thief is another metaphorical absolute; in this case, he represents the 'taking of the Tower' or, and sometimes more importantly, the 'taking' of the Tower's secret.\" If this is the case, then the enantiomorph (in which the Thief is identified with the Rebel, the ultimate victor of enantiomorphic conflict) can be seen as a vital part of understanding and finding the Secret Tower."}

Alldimar was an experienced warrior, having fought with many of the &lt;a href=\"Reachmen\"&gt;Reachmen&lt;/a&gt; in skirmishes. When he became king, despite his violent history, peace returned to the land. Many had questioned the previous policy of having a child become king, and Alddimar held respect due to his heroism and skill in combat.\nDespite his approval, his servants sometimes caught their king talking to people who weren't there. Likewise, a servant who kept to herself when the King was not around sparked suspicion. These rumors would eventually leak out to the city itself, resulting in an increasing sense of unease.\nA year and a day after Alldimar had been crowned High King, problems started. Every week, one person within &lt;a href=\"Solitude\"&gt;Solitude&lt;/a&gt; would die in a bizarre fashion. The servants of the king were said to have heard disembodied voices around the quarters of the king.\nAfter two years of reign, Alldimar himself would die, and reveal his secret. All the skulls of the victims of accidents were put together on a secret shelf within the quarters of the High King. This bizarre discovery earned the High King the title \"Ghostmaker.\""}

She mastered the skill by the age of fourteen and had joined a hunting party of her tribe as a &lt;a href=\"Jaqspur\"&gt;Jaqspur&lt;/a&gt;, a long distance shooter.\nDuring the &lt;a href=\"Black%20Year\"&gt;Black Year&lt;/a&gt;, when the &lt;a href=\"Parikh%20Tribe\"&gt;Parikh Tribe&lt;/a&gt; began their rampage through southeastern Valenwood with the aid of &lt;a href=\"Altmer\"&gt;Altmer&lt;/a&gt; of the &lt;a href=\"Summerset%20Isles\"&gt;Summerset Isles&lt;/a&gt;, Lady Benoch fought the battle to keep her tribe's land.\nBy the age of sixteen she had killed her first mer, whom was nothing more than a blur on the horizon where she aimed her bow. It meant no more to her than shooting an animal. That summer and fall she killed countless more invaders.\nHowever, that winter Lady Benoch experienced her first close encounter, her first time to look in a man's eyes as she spilled his blood. A scout from the Parikh Tribe surprised her while she was on camp watch. Young Lady Benoch panicked and tried to string an arrow when her opponent was just a half yard from her. The Parikh scout struck first with his blade and Lady Benoch fell in shock.\nThe scout assumed that he had drawn blood and Lady Benoch had fallen dead. But as soon as he had turned away from her she rushed at him and wrestled his blade from him. She stabbed him many times beyond counting and stopped only when the next watch came to relieve her. There was not a whole piece of the scout remaining \u2014 she had literally cut him to pieces.\nNow aware of this deficiency in her education, Lady Benoch began teaching herself swordmanship at once.\nAdventurer years.\nThere was no place in Valenwood to learn using a blade. The Parikh Tribe had also finally succeeded at driving Lady Benoch's tribe away. As much as it hurt there was nothing to be done, so Lady Benoch went north and met the &lt;a href=\"Redguards\"&gt;Redguards&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"Hammerfell\"&gt;Hammerfell&lt;/a&gt;.\nUnder the tutelage of &lt;a href=\"Warday%20A%27kor\"&gt;Warday A'kor&lt;/a&gt;, Lady Benoch studied all sorts of weapon wielding, eventually excelling at the art. Lady Benoch became a freelance adventurer afterwards, traveling through the wilds of southern Hammerfell and northern Valenwood.\nBy this time Lady Benoch owned an enchanted daikatana, made out of Daedric metal. It wasn't an &lt;a href=\"Akaviri\"&gt;Akaviri&lt;/a&gt; daikatana, since she couldn't afford one of them.\nOne day she took up the quest to get the gold back that some &lt;a href=\"Orsimer\"&gt;Orcs&lt;/a&gt; had stolen from a local chieftain in &lt;a href=\"Meditea\"&gt;Meditea&lt;/a&gt;. She went to look for them in one of the dungeons of the local countryside. There she met few overgrown rats and giant spiders, but she was veteran enough to deal with them with ease. The problem came when she found herself in a pitch black room surrounded by the Orcs, but surprisingly took down all of them with only a few swings of her sword, remembering a lesson Master A'kor had given her.\nLate life.\nLady Benoch became the master of Valenwood Fighters' Guild after she had won a duel with a former master, who was told to be a stooge inserted by &lt;a href=\"Jagar%20Tharn\"&gt;Jagar Tharn&lt;/a&gt;. However, two years later the guild was disintegrated.\nShe first came to the &lt;a href=\"Emperor\"&gt;Emperor's&lt;/a&gt; attention when Lady Benoch had protected &lt;a href=\"Akorithi\"&gt;Queen Akorithi&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"Sentinel\"&gt;Sentinel&lt;/a&gt; from a &lt;a href=\"Breton\"&gt;Breton&lt;/a&gt; assassin, who was rumored to be hired by some noble of &lt;a href=\"Daggerfall\"&gt;Daggerfall&lt;/a&gt;.\nLady Benoch also married her servant &lt;a href=\"Urken\"&gt;Urken&lt;/a&gt;, who had been serving her for eleven years. She herself admitted that there was no one else who knew how to care for her weapons as well as him.\nAfter that Lady Benoch served the Emperor in the Imperial Guard and was employed in many secret missions around &lt;a href=\"Tamriel\"&gt;Tamriel&lt;/a&gt;. She often had to travel from one side of the continent to the other.\nAnother significant deed of Lady Benoch was killing the Emperor's bastard &lt;a href=\"Calaxes\"&gt;Calaxes&lt;/a&gt;, who had hoped to revolt against the Imperial rule and establish a theocracy over the &lt;a href=\"Empire\"&gt;Empire&lt;/a&gt;."}

The three alliances involved were the &lt;a href=\"Aldmeri%20Dominion%20%28Online%29\"&gt;First Aldmeri Dominion&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"Ebonheart%20Pact\"&gt;Ebonheart Pact&lt;/a&gt;, and the &lt;a href=\"Daggerfall%20Covenant\"&gt;Daggerfall Covenant&lt;/a&gt;, all of which were fighting to rule &lt;a href=\"Tamriel\"&gt;Tamriel&lt;/a&gt;.\nHistory.\nIn &lt;a href=\"2E%20578\"&gt;2E 578&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Emperor\"&gt;Emperor&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Varen%20Aquilarios\"&gt;Varen Aquilarios&lt;/a&gt; was convinced by &lt;a href=\"Mannimarco%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Mannimarco&lt;/a&gt; that he knew a ritual which would allow him to become &lt;a href=\"Dragonborn%20%28Lore%29\"&gt;Dragonborn&lt;/a&gt;. Varen desired to further legitimize his claim to the Imperial throne by lighting the &lt;a href=\"Dragonfires\"&gt;Dragonfires&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;a href=\"Temple%20of%20the%20One\"&gt;Temple of the One&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;a href=\"Imperial%20City\"&gt;Imperial City&lt;/a&gt;, which can only be done by one of the Dragon Blood. Mannimarco and Varen were part of a group referred to as the &lt;a href=\"Five%20Companions\"&gt;Five Companions&lt;/a&gt;, which also included &lt;a href=\"Sai%20Sahan%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Sai Sahan&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Lyris%20Titanborn%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Lyris Titanborn&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Abnur%20Tharn%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Abnur Tharn&lt;/a&gt;. The ritual turned out to be an elaborate trick by Mannimarco. He then incapacitated the others and declared he was a servant of &lt;a href=\"Molag%20Bal%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Molag Bal&lt;/a&gt;, and the ritual was actually one that would weaken the barriers between &lt;a href=\"Mundus\"&gt;Mundus&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Coldharbour%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Coldharbour&lt;/a&gt;.\n&lt;a href=\"Clivia%20Tharn\"&gt;Clivia Tharn&lt;/a&gt; was soon after named the new Empress Regent of Tamriel and turned the &lt;a href=\"Empire\"&gt;Empire&lt;/a&gt; to &lt;a href=\"Daedric%20Princes\"&gt;Daedra&lt;/a&gt; worship, in particular Molag Bal. But Clivia's father, Abnur Tharn, who was the High Chancellor of the &lt;a href=\"Elder%20Council\"&gt;Elder Council&lt;/a&gt; and Overlord of &lt;a href=\"Nibenay\"&gt;Nibenay&lt;/a&gt;, despised Molag Bal and his minions. With the Tharn family divided, Clivia convinced Mannimarco to use his &lt;a href=\"Necromancy\"&gt;necromantic&lt;/a&gt; abilities to resurrect &lt;a href=\"Imperial%20Legion%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Imperial Soldiers&lt;/a&gt; to bolster the Empire's forces. When the alliances saw that the Empire was weak, they took advantage of its weakness in an attempt to expand their territory. Thus, the war began.\n&lt;a href=\"Imperial%20City%20Campaign%20%28Alliance%20War%29\"&gt;Imperial City Campaign&lt;/a&gt;.\nFollowing the Planemeld, the bridges to the &lt;a href=\"Imperial%20City%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Imperial City&lt;/a&gt; were cut off, blocking Imperial forces from entering the city and fighting the Daedra. The Legion garrisoned inside the city, &lt;a href=\"Legion%20Zero\"&gt;Legion Zero&lt;/a&gt;, swore oaths to Molag Bal and became mind shriven, helping his minions conquer the city. The three Alliances aimed to conquer the Imperial City, so they fought amongst themselves and against Molag Bal's forces.\nVictory.\nIn the end, the &lt;a href=\"Vestige\"&gt;Vestige&lt;/a&gt; destroyed the Anchor above the Imperial City, preserved the &lt;a href=\"Sublime%20Brazier\"&gt;Sublime Brazier&lt;/a&gt;, and depleted the Daedric and Legion Zero forces. An unknown period of time afterwards, the city was liberated.\nFactions.\nEbonheart Pact.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Ebonheart%20Pact\"&gt;Ebonheart Pact&lt;/a&gt; consists of three races: the &lt;a href=\"Nords%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Nords&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Dunmer%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Dunmer&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Argonians%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Argonians&lt;/a&gt;. It was originally founded during the &lt;a href=\"Second%20Akaviri%20Invasion\"&gt;Second Akaviri Invasion&lt;/a&gt;, and remained an alliance when Molag Bal and his Daedra forces invaded Tamriel. It is widely considered to be one of the most politically unstable alliances in Tamriel's history, as all three races have a history of wars and hardships with one another. The only motive that kept them together was their common goal of preserving their freedom and independence from the &lt;a href=\"Aldmeri%20Dominion%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Dominion&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Daggerfall%20Covenant\"&gt;Covenant&lt;/a&gt;, as well as their hatred of the &lt;a href=\"Akaviri\"&gt;Akaviri&lt;/a&gt; and Molag Bal's forces. The capital of the Ebonheart Pact is &lt;a href=\"Mournhold%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Mournhold&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Morrowind%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Morrowind&lt;/a&gt; and is led by &lt;a href=\"Jorunn%20the%20Skald-King\"&gt;Jorunn the Skald-King&lt;/a&gt;. The Pact was formed out of necessity after the Second Akaviri Invasion, 5 years after the Covenant was formed.\nIn &lt;a href=\"Cyrodiil%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Cyrodiil&lt;/a&gt;, the Pact's home territory spans 6 Keeps (&lt;a href=\"Kingscrest%20Keep\"&gt;Kingscrest&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Farragut%20Keep\"&gt;Farragut&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Arrius%20Keep\"&gt;Arrius&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Blue%20Road%20Keep\"&gt;Blue Road&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Chalman%20Keep\"&gt;Chalman&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Drakelowe%20Keep\"&gt;Drakelowe&lt;/a&gt;), 1 Outpost (&lt;a href=\"Sejanus%20Outpost\"&gt;Sejanus&lt;/a&gt;) and they control 2 Elder Scrolls (&lt;a href=\"Elder%20Scroll%20of%20Chim\"&gt;Chim&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Elder%20Scroll%20of%20Ghartok\"&gt;Ghartok&lt;/a&gt;). Their main supply line to Cyrodiil is through Morrowind and their forces there are commanded by &lt;a href=\"Grand%20Warlord%20Zimmeron\"&gt;Grand Warlord Zimmeron&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe Pact's motivations for fighting are to fight off all invaders and preserve the independence and freedom of their homelands.\nAldmeri Dominion.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Aldmeri%20Dominion%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Aldmeri Dominion&lt;/a&gt; is made up of &lt;a href=\"Altmer%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Altmer&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Bosmer%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Bosmer&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Khajiit%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Khajiit&lt;/a&gt;. The faction was originally founded to overthrow the Empire and restore &lt;a href=\"Mer\"&gt;Elven&lt;/a&gt; rule to Tamriel. The three races in the faction consider themselves to be the most civilized and intelligent of all the races of Tamriel. They also believe that they could rule Tamriel better than any human could, and that they were chosen by the &lt;a href=\"Aedra\"&gt;Divines&lt;/a&gt; to rule. The capital city of the Dominion is &lt;a href=\"Elden%20Root%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Elden Root&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Valenwood%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Valenwood&lt;/a&gt; and is led by &lt;a href=\"Queen%20Ayrenn%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Queen Ayrenn&lt;/a&gt; from the Summerset Isles. However, there is &lt;a href=\"Veiled%20Heritance\"&gt;some internal conflict&lt;/a&gt; in the Dominion, which threatens to destabilize the entire alliance if not kept at bay. The Dominion was formed in 2E 580 by Queen Ayrenn after months of diplomacy between Summerset, Valenwood and &lt;a href=\"Elsweyr%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Elsweyr&lt;/a&gt;.\nIn Cyrodiil, the Dominion's home territory spans 6 Castles (&lt;a href=\"Castle%20Bloodmayne\"&gt;Bloodmayne&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Castle%20Black%20Boot\"&gt;Black Boot&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Castle%20Faregyl\"&gt;Faregyl&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Castle%20Alessia\"&gt;Alessia&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Castle%20Roebeck\"&gt;Roebeck&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Castle%20Brindle\"&gt;Brindle&lt;/a&gt;), 1 Outpost (&lt;a href=\"Nikel%20Outpost\"&gt;Nikel&lt;/a&gt;) and they control 2 Elder Scrolls (&lt;a href=\"Elder%20Scroll%20of%20Mnem\"&gt;Mnem&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Elder%20Scroll%20of%20Altadoon\"&gt;Altadoon&lt;/a&gt;). Their main supply line to Cyrodiil is through Elsweyr and their forces there are commanded by &lt;a href=\"Grand%20Warlord%20Sorcalin\"&gt;Grand Warlord Sorcalin&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe Dominion's motivations for fighting are to restore Elven rule to Tamriel \u2013 the land which they settled long before men arrived from &lt;a href=\"Atmora\"&gt;Atmora&lt;/a&gt;.\nDaggerfall Covenant.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Daggerfall%20Covenant\"&gt;Daggerfall Covenant&lt;/a&gt; is made of &lt;a href=\"Bretons%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Bretons&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Redguards%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Redguards&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Orsimer%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Orsimer&lt;/a&gt;. Similar to the Ebonheart Pact, the three races in the Covenant had bad histories with one another. But trade disruptions caused much poverty and suffering to all three provinces. This lead to their unification as a faction for the sake of self preservation. The Covenant's capital city is &lt;a href=\"Wayrest%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Wayrest&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"High%20Rock%20%28Online%29\"&gt;High Rock&lt;/a&gt; is led by &lt;a href=\"High%20King%20Emeric%20%28Online%29\"&gt;King Emeric&lt;/a&gt;. The Covenant was formed in 2E 567 after the events of a brutal civil war in High Rock known as &lt;a href=\"King%20Ranser%27s%20War\"&gt;King Ranser's War&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe Covenant's home territory spans 6 Forts (&lt;a href=\"Fort%20Rayles%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Rayles&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Fort%20Warden\"&gt;Warden&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Fort%20Glademist\"&gt;Glademist&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Fort%20Ash%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Ash&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Fort%20Aleswell\"&gt;Aleswell&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Fort%20Dragonclaw\"&gt;Dragonclaw&lt;/a&gt;), 1 Outpost (&lt;a href=\"Bleakers%27%20Outpost\"&gt;Bleakers'&lt;/a&gt;) and they own 2 Elder Scrolls (&lt;a href=\"Elder%20Scroll%20of%20Ni-Mohk\"&gt;Ni-Mohk&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Elder%20Scroll%20of%20Alma%20Ruma\"&gt;Alma Ruma&lt;/a&gt;). Their main supply line to Cyrodiil is through Craglorn in Hammerfell and their forces there are commanded by &lt;a href=\"Grand%20Warlord%20Dortene\"&gt;Grand Warlord Dortene&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe Covenant's motivations for fighting are to restore the Empire and to end all the chaos and suffering going on in Tamriel caused due to the Empire's collapse."}

They are as follows:\nThe province of &lt;a href=\"Cyrodiil%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Cyrodiil&lt;/a&gt; remains disputed, and is a constant battleground between the three alliances.\nFormation.\nIn &lt;a href=\"2E%20579\"&gt;2E 579&lt;/a&gt;, an arcane explosion in the &lt;a href=\"Imperial%20City%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Imperial City&lt;/a&gt; known as the &lt;a href=\"Soulburst\"&gt;Soulburst&lt;/a&gt; set off a mystical aftershock that swept across\u00a0&lt;a href=\"Nirn\"&gt;Nirn&lt;/a&gt;, resulting in Emperor &lt;a href=\"Varen%20Aquilarios%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Varen Aquilarios&lt;/a&gt;' disappearance. His consort &lt;a href=\"Clivia%20Tharn\"&gt;Clivia Tharn&lt;/a&gt; succeeded him as Empress regent, though was unknowingly manipulated by &lt;a href=\"Mannimarco%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Mannimarco&lt;/a&gt;, who became the true power controlling the Imperial City. As &lt;a href=\"Dark%20Anchors\"&gt;Dark Anchors&lt;/a&gt; opened up across Tamriel, the &lt;a href=\"White-Gold%20Tower%20%28Online%29\"&gt;White-Gold Tower&lt;/a&gt; fell into the hands of &lt;a href=\"Molag%20Bal%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Molag Bal&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Order%20of%20the%20Black%20Worm%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Worm Cult&lt;/a&gt;, with Clivia Tharn missing and the &lt;a href=\"Elder%20Council\"&gt;Elder Council&lt;/a&gt; disbanding. The border between the plane of &lt;a href=\"Oblivion%20%28Realm%29\"&gt;Oblivion&lt;/a&gt; and Nirn was broken, and Molag Bal began his attempt to bring Tamriel into his realm of &lt;a href=\"Coldharbour%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Coldharbour&lt;/a&gt;, in an event known as the &lt;a href=\"Planemeld\"&gt;Planemeld&lt;/a&gt;. The &lt;a href=\"Daedra%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Daedra&lt;/a&gt; spawned all over &lt;a href=\"Tamriel\"&gt;Tamriel&lt;/a&gt; in greater numbers than ever before. The constellation of &lt;a href=\"the%20Serpent\"&gt;the Serpent&lt;/a&gt; grew so large that it dominated the night sky.\nWithout an &lt;a href=\"Emperor\"&gt;Emperor&lt;/a&gt; sitting on the &lt;a href=\"Ruby%20Throne\"&gt;Ruby Throne&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"the%20Empire\"&gt;the Empire&lt;/a&gt; fell into disrepair. Facing a great danger, many provinces united into different factions, each seeking to reclaim the throne and fulfill their own agendas.\nAlliances.\n&lt;a href=\"Aldmeri%20Dominion%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Aldmeri Dominion&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Aldmeri%20Dominion%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Aldmeri Dominion&lt;/a&gt; was a faction that united the provinces of &lt;a href=\"Summerset%20Isles%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Summerset Isles&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Valenwood%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Valenwood&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Elsweyr%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Elsweyr&lt;/a&gt;. Its capital, &lt;a href=\"Elden%20Root%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Elden Root&lt;/a&gt;, was found deep within the forests of Valenwood.\nThe faction's dominant race was the &lt;a href=\"Altmer%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Altmer&lt;/a&gt;, who ensured that the races of &lt;a href=\"Bosmer%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Bosmer&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Khajiit%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Khajiit&lt;/a&gt; would join their cause. The Aldmeri Dominion was led by the young Altmer &lt;a href=\"Queen%20Ayrenn%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Queen Ayrenn&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe main goal of the Aldmeri Dominion was to protect &lt;a href=\"Tamriel\"&gt;Tamriel&lt;/a&gt; from the Daedric disasters that &lt;a href=\"Nirn\"&gt;Nirn&lt;/a&gt; faced, and spare the continent from the corruption of &lt;a href=\"Men\"&gt;Men&lt;/a&gt;. To their minds, the short-lived race of Men were not worthy of ruler's role, and the only solution would be to take the throne for themselves.\n&lt;a href=\"Daggerfall%20Covenant\"&gt;Daggerfall Covenant&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe Daggerfall Covenant was a faction uniting the provinces of &lt;a href=\"High%20Rock%20%28Online%29\"&gt;High Rock&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Orsinium%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Orsinium&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Hammerfell%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Hammerfell&lt;/a&gt;. Its capital, &lt;a href=\"Wayrest%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Wayrest&lt;/a&gt;, was a great port city on the shore of the &lt;a href=\"Iliac%20Bay\"&gt;Iliac Bay&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe dominant race of the Daggerfall Covenant was the &lt;a href=\"Bretons%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Breton&lt;/a&gt;. With the help of their merchant' skillful diplomacy, the Daggerfall Covenant manages to ally with the races of &lt;a href=\"Redguards%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Redguard&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Orsimer%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Orsimer&lt;/a&gt;. The faction was led by the merchant &lt;a href=\"High%20King%20Emeric%20%28Online%29\"&gt;High King Emeric&lt;/a&gt;.\nWith the fall of the Imperial City the renown trade routes of the Daggerfall Covenant races were disrupted.\nWith no more trade the region could not prosper. Poverty and suffering spread throughout the land. By reclaiming the Ruby Throne, the Daggerfall Covenant sought to return the Empire and, more importantly, cities of the Iliac Bay to their former wealth.\n&lt;a href=\"Ebonheart%20Pact\"&gt;Ebonheart Pact&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe Ebonheart Pact was a faction uniting the provinces of &lt;a href=\"Skyrim%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Skyrim&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Morrowind%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Morrowind&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Black%20Marsh%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Black Marsh&lt;/a&gt;. Its capital, &lt;a href=\"Mournhold%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Mournhold&lt;/a&gt;, was situated on the mainland of Morrowind.\nThe dominant race of the Ebonheart Pact was the &lt;a href=\"Nords%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Nord&lt;/a&gt;.\u00a0The &lt;a href=\"Dunmer%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Dunmer&lt;/a&gt; and, eventually, the &lt;a href=\"Argonians%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Argonians&lt;/a&gt;\u00a0joined forces along with the Nords to survive the &lt;a href=\"Second%20Akaviri%20Invasion\"&gt;Second Akaviri Invasion&lt;/a&gt;. The leader of the faction was &lt;a href=\"High%20King\"&gt;High King&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Jorunn\"&gt;Jorunn&lt;/a&gt;. He, however, did not have all the power over the provinces, as a &lt;a href=\"Great%20Moot\"&gt;Great Moot&lt;/a&gt; was summoned, a council of all the allied races, whom he had to hear out.\nHaving protected Tamriel from the &lt;a href=\"Akaviri\"&gt;Akaviri&lt;/a&gt;, the members of the Ebonheart Pact thought to have earned the right as the rulers. Moreover, ever since the great conquests of the Nords in the &lt;a href=\"First%20Era\"&gt;First Era&lt;/a&gt;, they thought themselves to be superior and the rightful rulers of Tamriel."}

She was the wife of &lt;a href=\"Lord%20Indoril%20Nerevar\"&gt;Lord Indoril Nerevar&lt;/a&gt;, and after the death of her husband, she, alongside &lt;a href=\"Vivec\"&gt;Vivec&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Sotha%20Sil\"&gt;Sotha Sil&lt;/a&gt;, came to power amongst the Chimer, now known as &lt;a href=\"Dunmer\"&gt;Dunmer&lt;/a&gt;. She serves as the hidden main antagonist of .\nPersonality and traits.\nAlmalexia's public image was that of a nurturing and protecting mother-figure, kindly and just. But even before &lt;a href=\"Dagoth%20Ur%20%28Character%29\"&gt;Dagoth Ur's&lt;/a&gt; return, her real personality\u2014that of a powerful, serious, and ruthless leader and statesperson, resurfaced every now and then. Not much was known about her mortal days as the queen of the Chimer, but most likely she was instrumental in uniting the &lt;a href=\"Great%20Houses\"&gt;Great Houses&lt;/a&gt; and establishing &lt;a href=\"House%20Indoril\"&gt;House Indoril&lt;/a&gt; as the ruling one, and she was powerful even before her marriage to Nerevar. After the ascension of the Tribunal, she was the one who took her divinity the most seriously. Almalexia was the most skilled of the Tribunal in battle, and would have been able to defeat Vivec in single combat.\nAfter the loss of the &lt;a href=\"Heart%20of%20Lorkhan\"&gt;Heart of Lorkhan&lt;/a&gt;, Almalexia kept becoming less and less of a mother-figure and more and more of a ruthless leader. The gradual loss of her powers caused her much grief and eventually resulted in paranoia and obsession with returning the old glory at all costs. Eventually, she became insane to the point that she was willing to sacrifice the lives of her fellow Tribunes in order to regain her old power, but the stress damaged her capacity for sound plans and intrigue, and her scheme failed.\nBackground.\nLittle is known of Almalexia's origins, but she was &lt;a href=\"Indoril%20Nerevar\"&gt;Indoril Nerevar&lt;/a&gt;'s queen and one of his most trusted advisors during the Chimer-&lt;a href=\"Dwemer\"&gt;Dwemer&lt;/a&gt; alliance in the early &lt;a href=\"First%20Era\"&gt;First Era&lt;/a&gt;. Following the &lt;a href=\"Battle%20of%20Red%20Mountain\"&gt;Battle of Red Mountain&lt;/a&gt; and the death of Nerevar, she became one of the living \"gods\" worshipped by the Dunmer in the &lt;a href=\"Tribunal%20Temple\"&gt;Tribunal Temple&lt;/a&gt;, along with &lt;a href=\"Vivec\"&gt;Vivec&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Sotha%20Sil\"&gt;Sotha Sil&lt;/a&gt;.\nHer other names, the Healing Mother and Lady of Mercy, came from her being known as a source of compassion and sympathy, and her role as protector of the poor and weak. However, her compassionate nature did not prevent her from being a ruthless negotiator and leader, as well as a cunning warrior. She was an important symbol of Dunmer independence to those who resented the &lt;a href=\"Septim%20Empire\"&gt;Septim Empire&lt;/a&gt;. She resided in the royal capital of &lt;a href=\"Mournhold\"&gt;Mournhold&lt;/a&gt;, which took her name. Almalexia's closest followers were those of the Dunmer Great &lt;a href=\"House%20Indoril\"&gt;House Indoril&lt;/a&gt; who were the ruling class of Mournhold until the &lt;a href=\"Third%20Era\"&gt;Third Era&lt;/a&gt;, and thus all of Morrowind.\nShe was considered to be the mother figure of the Tribunal Temple as she looked after, nurtured, and healed the Dunmer that worshipped her. Almalexia was strict; however, when they strayed from the doctrines of the Tribunal Temple, often sending her personal guard, the Hands of Almalexia, to bring them back into the fold violently if need be. Along with the Hands of Almalexia, she also controlled the Ordinators of the House Indoril and developed their beliefs that the weakness of the Tribunal during the Third Era was caused by a lack of faith and religious fervor among its people.\nAlmalexia, along with Sotha Sil, combated the &lt;a href=\"Daedric%20Prince\"&gt;Daedric Prince&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Mehrunes%20Dagon\"&gt;Mehrunes Dagon&lt;/a&gt;, and his &lt;a href=\"Daedric%20Forces%20of%20Destruction\"&gt;Daedric Forces of Destruction&lt;/a&gt; during the &lt;a href=\"Sack%20of%20Mournhold\"&gt;Sack of Mournhold&lt;/a&gt;. However, they arrived too late, and the Duke of Mournhold along with its inhabitants had been massacred, and the city had been razed to the ground. She and Sotha Sil managed to defeat Mehrunes Dagon and cast him and his forces back to the wastelands of &lt;a href=\"Oblivion%20%28Realm%29\"&gt;Oblivion&lt;/a&gt;. During the &lt;a href=\"Vvardenfell%20Crisis\"&gt;Vvardenfell Crisis&lt;/a&gt;, Almalexia kept to behind the scenes, helping Vivec and Sotha Sil come to decisions on what action to take against Dagoth Ur and the &lt;a href=\"Sixth%20House%20Cult\"&gt;Sixth House Cult&lt;/a&gt;. Thus, she was not informed about Vivec's decision to involve the &lt;a href=\"Nerevarine\"&gt;Nerevarine&lt;/a&gt;, as she strictly conformed to Tribunal doctrines and would not believe that this person was actually the Nerevarine.\nAfter the death of her old enemy Dagoth Ur during the Vvardenfell Crisis, Almalexia slowly began to lose her sanity, turning on her fellow god, Sotha Sil, and slaying him in his &lt;a href=\"Clockwork%20City\"&gt;Clockwork City&lt;/a&gt;. She then unleashed its mechanical inhabitants in a reign of terror, for which Sotha Sil took the blame. Eventually, the Nerevarine came to Mournhold, and when he arrived, Almalexia sought to trick, entrap, and destroy them in an attempt to regain her former power and prestige. When the Nerevarine confronted her bearing her old husband's sword, &lt;a href=\"Trueflame\"&gt;Trueflame&lt;/a&gt;, her god-like powers were robbed from her and the Nerevarine cast her down in the Clockwork City.\nHistory.\nFirst Era.\nEarly life and War of the First Council.\nAccording to the &lt;a href=\"Tribunal%20Temple\"&gt;Tribunal Temple&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Molag%20Bal\"&gt;Molag Bal&lt;/a&gt; oversaw the ninety-nine lovers of &lt;a href=\"Boethiah\"&gt;Boethiah&lt;/a&gt; give birth to Almalexia on &lt;a href=\"Mount%20Assarnibibi\"&gt;Mount Assarnibibi&lt;/a&gt;. It is known that early in the &lt;a href=\"First%20Era\"&gt;First Era&lt;/a&gt; before the beginning of the &lt;a href=\"Nord\"&gt;Nord&lt;/a&gt; raids on &lt;a href=\"Morrowind\"&gt;Morrowind&lt;/a&gt; that she married &lt;a href=\"Indoril%20Nerevar\"&gt;Indoril Nerevar&lt;/a&gt;, and together created the Great &lt;a href=\"Dunmer\"&gt;Dunmer&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"House%20Indoril\"&gt;House Indoril&lt;/a&gt;. She was one of his most trusted advisers, along with &lt;a href=\"Sotha%20Sil\"&gt;Sotha Sil&lt;/a&gt; who was his chief councilor and &lt;a href=\"Vivec%20the%20Poet\"&gt;Vivec the Poet&lt;/a&gt;, his junior councilor. At this period of time in the First Era, the Chimer and their distant kin, the &lt;a href=\"Dwemer\"&gt;Dwemer&lt;/a&gt; were embroiled in a long, and bloody war which went on intermittently for at least a decade. Then, the Nords came and invaded Morrowind, and against the advice of Almalexia, Nerevar decided to join in an alliance with King &lt;a href=\"Dumac\"&gt;Dumac&lt;/a&gt; of the Dwemer. Nerevar, Almalexia, and Dumac led the &lt;a href=\"mer\"&gt;mer&lt;/a&gt; of Morrowind to victory, driving the Nords back into &lt;a href=\"Skyrim\"&gt;Skyrim&lt;/a&gt;.\nFollowing the war, Nerevar and Dumac managed to keep the peace between their people through treaties and pacts with the aid of Almalexia, Vivec, and Sotha Sil. However; due to their peoples' conflicting beliefs, the Dwemer believed that there were no gods and the Chimer worshipped the &lt;a href=\"Daedra\"&gt;Daedra&lt;/a&gt;, Almalexia, and Nerevar's other councilors began to question the alliance and began to dispute the peace treaties. The final straw occurred when &lt;a href=\"Dagoth%20Ur%20%28Character%29\"&gt;Dagoth Ur&lt;/a&gt;, one of Nerevar's newest councilors and the head of &lt;a href=\"House%20Dagoth\"&gt;House Dagoth&lt;/a&gt;, brought Nerevar and Almalexia the news that the Dwemer engineer &lt;a href=\"Kagrenac\"&gt;Kagrenac&lt;/a&gt; had found the &lt;a href=\"Heart%20of%20Lorkhan\"&gt;Heart of Lorkhan&lt;/a&gt; and learned of a way to tap its power to create his own god. Troubled, Nerevar and Almalexia confronted Dumac and Kagrenac, only to be treated with hostility and suspicion. They then went to the shrine of &lt;a href=\"Holamayan\"&gt;Holamayan&lt;/a&gt; where they prayed to &lt;a href=\"Azura\"&gt;Azura&lt;/a&gt;, a Daedric Prince, and had their fears confirmed.\nAlmalexia, Vivec, and Sotha Sil chided Nerevar for his decision to create the alliance and for not resuming the war with the Dwemer earlier. They also chided Nerevar for his belief that the Dwemer could be reasoned and bargained with. However; he stood by his beliefs and refused to go to war with the Dwemer. Troubled, Vivec and Sotha Sil went to Almalexia and convinced her to speak to Nerevar on their behalf. When Almalexia and Nerevar were alone, she reminded him of his duty to protect the faith and security of the Chimer people against the impiety and dangerous ambition of the Dwemer. Nerevar saw her reasoning, and after going one more time to try to force Dumac to see reason, declared war on the Dwemer, beginning the War of the First Council.\nAlmalexia traveled with Nerevar while he was leading the Chimer armies against the Dwemer, and their allies, Nord raiders and certain more secular Chimer &lt;a href=\"Great%20Houses\"&gt;Great Houses&lt;/a&gt; that had been enticed by riches to join with the Dwemer. Nerevar, his queen, and his councilors developed a cunning plan that drew the Dwemer forces out of their near impenetrable fortress at &lt;a href=\"Red%20Mountain\"&gt;Red Mountain&lt;/a&gt;, a vast mountain chain that surrounded a large volcano. Nerevar, accompanied by his lieutenant Dagoth Ur and a small company of his most skilled warriors, gained entrance to the fortress while the Dwemer forces were fighting with the Chimer forces on a plain in front of Red Mountain. Inside they encountered the Dwemer king, Dumac, and slew him. They then proceeded to the Heart chamber, but were too late. Kagrenac had turned his tools upon the Heart of Lorkhan, and all of the Dwemer, both inside and outside of the fortress, disappeared.\nThough Almalexia's exact role during the &lt;a href=\"Battle%20of%20Red%20Mountain\"&gt;Battle of Red Mountain&lt;/a&gt; was unknown, her role in the aftermath was well-documented. Following the defeat of the Dwemer, Nerevar left Dagoth Ur to protect the Heart of Lorkhan while he conferred with his queen and councilors about what to do with it. Almalexia, Vivec, and Sotha Sil counseled Nerevar to keep the Heart of Lorkhan and &lt;a href=\"Kagrenac%27s%20Tools\"&gt;Kagrenac's Tools&lt;/a&gt; to study them to find some way to benefit the Chimer people. They also believed that the Dwemer would return and that they should study these tools to have an insight into their abilities and powers. Nerevar disagreed with them, but he agreed to do as they asked under one condition: that they would not use the Heart of Lorkhan for the same purpose that the Dwemer had used it for. Agreeing with Nerevar, Almalexia, along with Vivec and Sotha Sil, swore an oath to Azura that they would not use the Heart of Lorkhan in a profane manner.\nWanting to take possession of the Heart and Kagrenac's Tools right away, the four returned to Red Mountain, and upon arriving were confronted by Dagoth Ur and a small band of his followers who had been corrupted by the evil power of the Heart of Lorkhan. Dagoth Ur refused to give up the heart, and Nerevar and the Tribunal, as the Chimer people had begun to call them, assaulted Dagoth Ur and his followers. Somehow in the ensuing battle, Nerevar was slain, but the Tribunal managed to capture the tools. Dagoth Ur and his followers fled into the bowels of the Dwemer fortress, and the Tribunal eventually began to believe that he had perished there. Sotha Sil promptly took the tools for studying and protection.\nSometime between the year &lt;a href=\"1E%20668\"&gt;1E 668&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"1E%20700\"&gt;1E 700&lt;/a&gt;, after the &lt;a href=\"War%20of%20the%20First%20Council\"&gt;War of the First Council&lt;/a&gt; and the death of Lord Nerevar, Sotha Sil managed to find a way to tap the Heart of Lorkhan in order to make himself and the rest of the Tribunal into gods. Almalexia, accompanied by Sotha Sil and Vivec, went to the Heart Chamber in the Red Mountain to perform the ritual. Shortly after the ritual was complete, the Daedric Prince Azura arrived and confronted them about the breaking of their oaths to Nerevar. Sotha Sil answered Azura, stating that the Chimer would no longer worship the Daedra as they now had better gods. Azura was furious, and in her anger, she cursed the entire Chimer race. The Chimers' skin turned to gray and their eyes changed to red. From then on, the Chimer became known as the Dunmer.\nSack of Mournhold.\nFollowing the &lt;a href=\"War%20of%20the%20First%20Council\"&gt;War of the First Council&lt;/a&gt;, Almalexia, Sotha Sil, and Vivec went forth from &lt;a href=\"Red%20Mountain\"&gt;Red Mountain&lt;/a&gt; to create a new world that they would shape in their own vision. They secured a powerbase among the &lt;a href=\"Dunmer\"&gt;Dunmer&lt;/a&gt; people by displaying their qualities of generosity and the glory that they had achieved during the War of the First Council against the &lt;a href=\"Dwemer\"&gt;Dwemer&lt;/a&gt; led by King &lt;a href=\"Dumac\"&gt;Dumac&lt;/a&gt; and High Priest &lt;a href=\"Kagrenac\"&gt;Kagrenac&lt;/a&gt;. After they had been assured that they had not been cursed with their new bodies, but instead, given a gift distinguishing them from the rest of the less-civilized &lt;a href=\"mer\"&gt;mer&lt;/a&gt;, the Dunmer began to fervently and gratefully worship them as the Tribunal of Gods. Over the years following the War of the First Council, Almalexia and the other members of the Tribunal began to craft the customs and institutions of their new society, including the religious organization that would oversee the Dunmer worship of the Tribunal, the &lt;a href=\"Tribunal%20Temple\"&gt;Tribunal Temple&lt;/a&gt;. For several centuries, &lt;a href=\"Morrowind\"&gt;Morrowind&lt;/a&gt; knew peace for the first time in a millennia under the guidance of Almalexia and the Tribunal. Their rule brought peace, equity, and prosperity to a once barren land.\nIn the final years of the &lt;a href=\"First%20Era\"&gt;First Era&lt;/a&gt;, Lord &lt;a href=\"Sotha%20Sil\"&gt;Sotha Sil&lt;/a&gt; visited the Daedric realm of &lt;a href=\"Coldharbour\"&gt;Coldharbour&lt;/a&gt; following the destruction of the city of &lt;a href=\"Gilverdale\"&gt;Gilverdale&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;a href=\"Bosmer\"&gt;Bosmer&lt;/a&gt;-inhabited land of &lt;a href=\"Valenwood\"&gt;Valenwood&lt;/a&gt; by the Daedric Prince &lt;a href=\"Molag%20Bal\"&gt;Molag Bal&lt;/a&gt;. At Coldharbour, Sotha Sil proposed a meeting with the major Daedric Princes of the realm of &lt;a href=\"Oblivion%20%28Realm%29\"&gt;Oblivion&lt;/a&gt;. The Daedric Princes agreed. They then arrived at Coldharbour to discuss with Sotha Sil about the attack on Gilverdale. Eventually, after much deliberation, Sotha Sil made a deal with eight of the more prominent Daedric Princes, including &lt;a href=\"Azura\"&gt;Azura&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Boethiah\"&gt;Boethiah&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Hermaeus%20Mora\"&gt;Hermaeus Mora&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Hircine\"&gt;Hircine&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Malacath\"&gt;Malacath&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Mehrunes%20Dagon\"&gt;Mehrunes Dagon&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Molag%20Bal\"&gt;Molag Bal&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Sheogorath\"&gt;Sheogorath&lt;/a&gt;. The deal consisted of several terms, the most prominent of them being that during the war between the Tribunal Temple-led Morrowind and the &lt;a href=\"Reman%20Empire\"&gt;Reman Empire&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"Cyrodiil\"&gt;Cyrodiil&lt;/a&gt;, they were not to accept the summons of any mortal unless it was done by highly powerful witches or sorcerers.\nHowever, a former spymaster of &lt;a href=\"Vivec%20the%20Poet\"&gt;Vivec the Poet&lt;/a&gt; managed to bypass the agreement to further his own ends by manipulating and fueling the rage of a witch who was a member of the powerful witches' coven known as the &lt;a href=\"Skeffington%20Coven\"&gt;Skeffington Coven&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;a href=\"Breton\"&gt;Breton&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Orsimer\"&gt;Orsimer&lt;/a&gt;-inhabited land of &lt;a href=\"High%20Rock\"&gt;High Rock&lt;/a&gt;. Using the witch's desire for revenge against the Duke of Mournhold, the spymaster managed to fulfill his desire to see that Morrowind suffered after an unnamed injustice done to him by Vivec. The witch, under his guidance, summoned the Daedric Prince of Destruction, Mehrunes Dagon. In Morrowind, Mehrunes Dagon went on a rampage of destruction and death, destroying the ancient home of the Dunmer Great &lt;a href=\"House%20Sotha\"&gt;House Sotha&lt;/a&gt; and the birthplace of Sotha Sil, &lt;a href=\"Ald%20Sotha\"&gt;Ald Sotha&lt;/a&gt;.\nAided by his armies of &lt;a href=\"Daedra\"&gt;Daedra&lt;/a&gt;, known as the &lt;a href=\"Daedric%20Forces%20of%20Destruction\"&gt;Daedric Forces of Destruction&lt;/a&gt;, Mehrunes Dagon invaded the heartland of Morrowind. Mehrunes Dagon assaulted the capital of Morrowind, &lt;a href=\"Mournhold\"&gt;Mournhold&lt;/a&gt;, and initiated one of the bloodiest massacres and most terrible destruction in recorded history. Almalexia, returning with Sotha Sil from Coldharbour, arrived at Mournhold, and confronted with the image of destruction and death that was Mournhold at the time. Entering the city, Almalexia and Sotha Sil confronted Mehrunes Dagon and, using their combined god-like powers, defeated Dagon and banished him back into his realm of Oblivion. However, Mournhold had been completely destroyed, and the Duke of Mournhold, along with most of Mournhold's inhabitants, had been slain. Under the direction of Almalexia, a new city was built right atop the ruins of the old city, and its suburbs were renamed Almalexia City for her part in its liberation and reconstruction. A statue depicting her battle with Mehrunes Dagon was erected in the heart of Mournhold to commemorate her victory.\nSecond Era.\nThe assassination of the last members of the &lt;a href=\"Reman%20Dynasty\"&gt;Reman Dynasty&lt;/a&gt; and their Tsaesci advisers who took over the reins of power after their deaths, &lt;a href=\"Versidue-Shaie\"&gt;Versidue-Shaie&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Savirien-Chorak\"&gt;Savirien-Chorak&lt;/a&gt;, brought the Reman Empire's reign over the continent of &lt;a href=\"Tamriel\"&gt;Tamriel&lt;/a&gt; to an end. For several more centuries, Morrowind managed to rebuild from its defeat in the Four Score War under Almalexia and the rest of the Tribunal Temple's guidance. However, this newfound peace and prosperity was interrupted by an invasion by the &lt;a href=\"Kamal\"&gt;Kamal&lt;/a&gt;, a race that inhabited the continent of &lt;a href=\"Akavir\"&gt;Akavir&lt;/a&gt; and were known as the Snow Demons of Kamal, led by their king and general &lt;a href=\"Ada%27Soom%20Dir-Kamal\"&gt;Ada'Soom Dir-Kamal&lt;/a&gt;. The Kamal forces managed to initially defeat the Dunmer forces under the command of the Tribunal, and they advanced down the province of &lt;a href=\"Vvardenfell\"&gt;Vvardenfell&lt;/a&gt;, a large island in the separated from the majority of Morrowind by the &lt;a href=\"Sea%20of%20Ghosts\"&gt;Sea of Ghosts&lt;/a&gt;, and assaulted &lt;a href=\"Vivec%20City\"&gt;Vivec City&lt;/a&gt;, Vivec the Poet's seat of power. Under the guidance of Almalexia and Vivec, the Dunmer inhabitants of Vivec City were taught how to breathe underwater. Then, the Tribunal struck a major blow against the Kamal forces, flooding the area around Vivec City, drowning the majority of their forces. However, the Kamal continued on, assaulting the mainland of Morrowind.\nDesperate to stop the Kamal invasion, Almalexia secretly traveled back into Vvardenfell, now Kamal-occupied territory, and went to the &lt;a href=\"Red%20Mountain\"&gt;Red Mountain&lt;/a&gt;, the ancient site of the defeat of the &lt;a href=\"Dwemer\"&gt;Dwemer&lt;/a&gt; during the War of the First Council in the &lt;a href=\"First%20Era\"&gt;First Era&lt;/a&gt;. In the ruins of the ancient Dwemer fortress, she found the slumbering form of the Underking, &lt;a href=\"Ysmir%20Wulfharth\"&gt;Ysmir Wulfharth&lt;/a&gt;, and awakened him. She summoned him to assist the Dunmer in their struggle against the Kamal and their leader, the Akaviri Demon, Ada'Soom Dir-Kamal. The combined power of the Tribunal Temple and Ysmir Wulfharth, the Underking, managed to overwhelm the remnants of the Kamal forces, slew Ada'Soom Dir-Kamal, and drove the Kamal from Morrowind.\nThird Era.\nAlmalexia served as a protector of the Dunmer for thousands of years until she was cut off from the source of their divinity during 2E 882, due to the return of &lt;a href=\"Dagoth%20Ur%20%28Character%29\"&gt;Dagoth Ur&lt;/a&gt;, one of &lt;a href=\"Indoril%20Nerevar\"&gt;Indoril Nerevar&lt;/a&gt;'s councilors who had betrayed him. Dagoth Ur and the rest of the members of the Dunmer Great &lt;a href=\"House%20Dagoth\"&gt;House Dagoth&lt;/a&gt; were slumbering in the depths of the ancient &lt;a href=\"Dwemer\"&gt;Dwemer&lt;/a&gt; fortress at &lt;a href=\"Red%20Mountain\"&gt;Red Mountain&lt;/a&gt;, regaining their strength for a future confrontation with the &lt;a href=\"Tribunal%20Temple\"&gt;Tribunal Temple&lt;/a&gt;. Finally ready to challenge the Tribunal, Dagoth Ur and his ash vampires awoke refreshed and emerged from the depths of the Dwemer fortress at Red Mountain into the Heart Chamber. Dagoth Ur then ritually bound himself and his brethren as heartwights in a ritual of his own devising. The first stages of the construction of the &lt;a href=\"Numidium%23Akulakhan\"&gt;Second Numidium&lt;/a&gt;, which had been conceived by Dagoth Ur during his long sleep, were begun by heartwights and atronach constructs in a chamber near the Heart of Lorkhan. Dagoth Ur decided that keeping the Second Numidium project a secret from Almalexia and the rest of the Tribunal was a high priority.\nAlmalexia, accompanied by &lt;a href=\"Vivec%20the%20Poet\"&gt;Vivec the Poet&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Sotha%20Sil\"&gt;Sotha Sil&lt;/a&gt;, arrived at Red Mountain for their annual ritual bathing in the Heart of Lorkhan's power. Dagoth Ur and his ash vampire kin ambushed Almalexia and the rest of the Tribunal in the Heart Chamber. Almalexia, Vivec, and Sotha Sil were driven away, and were prevented from restoring their god-like powers with &lt;a href=\"Kagrenac%27s%20Tools\"&gt;Kagrenac's Tools&lt;/a&gt; at the Heart of Lorkhan. Almalexia led several Tribunal Temple campaigns in assaults on Red Mountain. The Tribunal and their forces sought to force access to the Heart Chamber, but were repeatedly driven back by Dagoth Ur's minions.\nWhile Almalexia, Vivec, and Sotha Sil were creating a treaty with the &lt;a href=\"Septim%20Empire\"&gt;Septim Empire&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"Cyrodiil\"&gt;Cyrodiil&lt;/a&gt; that would allow the Dunmer to retain their ancient culture, customs, and institutions even though they were now a part of the Septim Empire, a &lt;a href=\"House%20Dagoth\"&gt;House Dagoth&lt;/a&gt; campaign reoccupied &lt;a href=\"Kogoruhn\"&gt;Kogoruhn&lt;/a&gt; under the command of &lt;a href=\"Dagoth%20Uthol\"&gt;Dagoth Uthol&lt;/a&gt; and fortified it as an advance base for Sixth House operations. The powers of &lt;a href=\"Dagoth%20Ur%20%28Character%29\"&gt;Dagoth Ur&lt;/a&gt; made blight storms both more frequent and widespread. House Dagoth also began to spread the &lt;a href=\"Corprus\"&gt;Corprus&lt;/a&gt; in the regions directly around their base at Red Mountain. Tribunal forces discovered Sixth House bases near &lt;a href=\"Gnaar%20Mok\"&gt;Gnaar Mok&lt;/a&gt; and in the waterfront areas of &lt;a href=\"Vivec%20City\"&gt;Vivec City&lt;/a&gt;. Sixth House operatives began to exploit smuggler organizations and communications to spread their influence among victims unbalanced by Dagoth Ur's dream sendings.\nAlmalexia slowly became insane as her power kept draining, which resulted in her ceasing communication with the rest of the Tribunal and even her own people. This change resulted in Almalexia turning into a completely different person, from once being compassionate and loving, into a madwoman who became obsessed with gaining power for herself while caring very little for her people. She had plans to unite all of her people under one faith and one rule, as the one true god of the Dunmer. In 3E 427, Almalexia ended up killing Sotha Sil and unleashed his clockwork contraptions to attack her own city &lt;a href=\"Mournhold\"&gt;Mournhold&lt;/a&gt; in order to frame her old friend and lure the &lt;a href=\"Nerevarine\"&gt;Nerevarine&lt;/a&gt;, the reincarnation of her husband, to &lt;a href=\"Clockwork%20City\"&gt;Clockwork City&lt;/a&gt;, where she would try to kill him too. It ended in her death at the hands of the Nerevarine and later being renamed as a saint rather than a god.\nLegacy as Saint Almalexia.\nInitially, no one believed the Nerevarine when they told them about Almalexia and Sotha Sil's deaths, other than &lt;a href=\"Helseth%20Hlaalu\"&gt;Helseth Hlaalu&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Barenziah\"&gt;Barenziah&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Vivec\"&gt;Vivec&lt;/a&gt;. Her body was retrieved by Vivec, who interred her and Sotha Sil in the proper Velothi fashion. In &lt;a href=\"3E%20433\"&gt;3E 433&lt;/a&gt;, most of the &lt;a href=\"Redoran\"&gt;Redoran&lt;/a&gt; and the Temple believed that Almalexia still lived and considered it heretical to suggest otherwise. \nThe worship of Almalexia ceased as the &lt;a href=\"Dissident%20Priests\"&gt;Dissident Priests&lt;/a&gt; took control of the &lt;a href=\"Tribunal%20Temple\"&gt;Tribunal Temple&lt;/a&gt; and propagated their doctrine of &lt;a href=\"The%20Reclamations\"&gt;Reclamations&lt;/a&gt;, according to which, &lt;a href=\"Boethiah\"&gt;Boethiah&lt;/a&gt; should once again be worshipped instead of Almalexia. Instead, she was redesignated to just a saint in the &lt;a href=\"New%20Temple\"&gt;New Temple&lt;/a&gt; religion alongside Vivec and Sotha Sil, similarly to Nerevar, &lt;a href=\"Felms\"&gt;Felms&lt;/a&gt; or later, &lt;a href=\"Jiub\"&gt;Jiub&lt;/a&gt;. She was believed to be either dead or have disappeared by the citizens of Morrowind.\nIn &lt;a href=\"4E%20201\"&gt;4E 201&lt;/a&gt;, cults dedicated to worshiping Almalexia were still active, including one headquartered in a cave on Solstheim called &lt;a href=\"Ashfall%27s%20Tear\"&gt;Ashfall's Tear&lt;/a&gt;."}

The girl's balance was awful for her lack of tail and she could not hear as keenly as her kin for her tiny ears. She could not hunt, nor could she steal, nor could she weave magic. The girl felt so, so alone, even in the company of her own kind.\nSo she ran, far, far away across &lt;a href=\"Tamriel\"&gt;Tamriel&lt;/a&gt;, hiding amongst merchant caravans and eating the most revolting garbage and refuse just to survive. When found, she was tossed out into the mud or beaten with sticks. They called her a monster! How awful!\nThere was one bright ray in her life, however. One day she encountered a magnificent traveling circus, comprised of people much like herself. They did not spurn her for her appearance, for they were as freakish as she! They taught her to play the dulcimer and crush bones with her flat teeth for the of others.\nOf course, the girl still felt alone all the time, but she was happy because she realized that she didn't have to be alone by herself."}

Soul Gems shatter after being used, with the exception of &lt;a href=\"Azura%27s%20Star%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;Azura's Star&lt;/a&gt;.

{"id": "17806", "revid": "25356303", "url": "https://elderscrolls.fandom.com/wiki?curid=17806", "title": "Altar of Spellmaking (Oblivion)", "text": "The Altars of Spellmaking are used for &lt;a href=\"Spellmaking%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;spellcrafting&lt;/a&gt;, which enables &lt;a href=\"Spells%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;spells&lt;/a&gt; to be made by buying them from any Spell-making &lt;a href=\"Mage%20%28Class%29\"&gt;mage&lt;/a&gt;, once the spell type had been unlocked. Spellcrafting becomes an accessible feature once the &lt;a href=\"Hero%20of%20Kvatch\"&gt;Hero of Kvatch&lt;/a&gt; completes all the recommendations for the &lt;a href=\"Mages%20Guild%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;Mages Guild&lt;/a&gt; and gains access to the &lt;a href=\"Arcane%20University%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;Arcane University&lt;/a&gt;. Spellcrafting consumes . The magnitude and duration of the spells created cannot exceed the &lt;a href=\"Skills%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;skill&lt;/a&gt; level of that &lt;a href=\"school%20of%20Magicka\"&gt;school of Magicka&lt;/a&gt;. This contrasts with \"'s\" predecessor, .\nFunction and use.\nTo create a spell, approach the Altar of Spellmaking and select the spell types desired for the new spell. Once the spell-type is selected, the magnitude, duration, and target must also be selected. Once the desired effects have been selected, the spell must be named and created. The cost to create a spell increases with the number of spells woven together as well as their magnitude.\nSpell type.\nMultiple spell types can be combined. A spell effect appears in the selection menu once a spell of that type has been learned by the hero. A basic spell, such as &lt;a href=\"Detect%20Life%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;Minor Detect Life&lt;/a&gt; can be used to create Master-level Detect Life spells, so the magnitude of the spell already learned does not affect the maximum level at which a spell can be created. However, magnitude, damage, and range require that a certain &lt;a href=\"rank\"&gt;rank&lt;/a&gt; be achieved in that spell school before it can be created.\nMagnitude and duration.\nMagnitude and duration depend on one's skill level with the spell school. A &lt;a href=\"Fire%20Damage%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;Fireball spell&lt;/a&gt;, for instance, doing 9,000 damage would require a &lt;a href=\"Destruction%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;Destruction&lt;/a&gt; skill of 100 to create. Longer spell durations, or Damage-Over-Time, also requires higher spell levels for almost anything above 5 seconds. If a spell with multiple functions is created, the one with the highest magnitude or duration becomes the skill that requires a specific rank to create. For instance, adding a four-second &lt;a href=\"Light%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;Light&lt;/a&gt; effect to a &lt;a href=\"Turn%20Undead%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;Turn Undead&lt;/a&gt; spell that rebukes &lt;a href=\"Undead%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;undead&lt;/a&gt; of up to level 30, &lt;a href=\"Illusion%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;Illusion&lt;/a&gt; will not be the skill judging whether it can be created.\nUsefulness.\nCreating custom spells is incredibly useful for mages.\nFeather.\n&lt;a href=\"Feather%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;Feather&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Spells%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;spells&lt;/a&gt; that also add positive effects such as &lt;a href=\"Fortify%20Strength%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;Fortify Strength&lt;/a&gt; can augment the number of items carried for a brief period of time, beneficial for mages with low &lt;a href=\"Strength%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;Strength&lt;/a&gt;.\nOpen spells.\nNo &lt;a href=\"Spell%20Merchants%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;spell merchant&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Cyrodiil\"&gt;Cyrodiil&lt;/a&gt; carries an Open Very Hard Lock spell. This type of spell is extremely beneficial for completing the &lt;a href=\"Thieves%20Guild%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;Thieves Guild&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Dark%20Brotherhood%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;Dark Brotherhood&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Quests%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;quests&lt;/a&gt;, which require advanced lockpicking skills. It also increases the mage's chance of breaking into and other heavily fortified locations where valuable loot can be &lt;a href=\"stolen\"&gt;stolen&lt;/a&gt;, then sold to a &lt;a href=\"Fence%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;fence&lt;/a&gt;. However, obtaining the &lt;a href=\"Skeleton%20Key%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;Skeleton key&lt;/a&gt; from &lt;a href=\"Nocturnal\"&gt;Lady Nocturnal&lt;/a&gt; makes this type of spell useless later on, unless one prefers to gain the &lt;a href=\"Alteration%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;Alteration&lt;/a&gt; experience ahead of time. The Open Very Hard Lock spell requires a large amount of gold to create and an Alteration skill of 75.\nParalyze.\nEvery mage benefits from using &lt;a href=\"Paralyze%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;paralysis&lt;/a&gt; to disable foes. Combining a paralysis spell effect with a damaging spell, such as &lt;a href=\"Cold%20Touch\"&gt;Cold Touch&lt;/a&gt; can help the mage easily fell melee oriented foes. Not only will the foe receive &lt;a href=\"Magicka%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;Magicka&lt;/a&gt; damage, but they will be temporarily incapable of moving, long enough for the mage to draw and kill the foe with an &lt;a href=\"Enchanted%20Weapons%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;enchanted weapon&lt;/a&gt;. Further benefits can be gained if a &lt;a href=\"Weakness%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;Weakness&lt;/a&gt; spell is added, such as &lt;a href=\"Weakness%20to%20Frost%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;Weakness to Frost&lt;/a&gt;. In conjunction with Frost Damage, paralysis, and a weapon enchanted with Frost Damage, any foe can be easily taken down. If the mage also uses &lt;a href=\"Invisibility%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;Invisibility&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"Chameleon%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;Chameleon&lt;/a&gt;, they can sneak up on a foe, use the paralysis spell, and attack with an enchanted weapon, then resume invisibility so as not to stir attention from other foes that may be nearby.\nDestruction and armorer.\nPurchasing &lt;a href=\"Corrode%20Armor\"&gt;Corrode Armor&lt;/a&gt; from &lt;a href=\"Sulinus%20Vassinus\"&gt;Sulinus Vassinus&lt;/a&gt; at the &lt;a href=\"Skingrad%20Mages%20Guild\"&gt;Skingrad Mages Guild&lt;/a&gt; allows the creation of a Damage Armor spell on self. Equipping throw-away pieces of armor and repeatedly casting the spell helps level &lt;a href=\"Destruction%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;Destruction&lt;/a&gt; very quickly. The damaged armor can then be repaired using &lt;a href=\"Repair%20Hammer%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;Repair Hammers&lt;/a&gt;. This is ideal for raising the &lt;a href=\"Armorer%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;Armorer&lt;/a&gt; spell to level 50, at which point &lt;a href=\"Enchanted%20Armor%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;Enchanted Armor&lt;/a&gt; can be repaired without spending excessive amounts of at an armor shop. This strategy is effective for &lt;a href=\"Battlemage\"&gt;Battlemage&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"Spellsword\"&gt;Spellsword&lt;/a&gt;s, and &lt;a href=\"Sorcerer%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;Sorcerers&lt;/a&gt; who frequently use &lt;a href=\"Heavy%20Armor%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;Heavy armor&lt;/a&gt; in battle and would benefit from added magical bonuses to their armor.\nCharm, mercantile, and personality.\n&lt;a href=\"Charm%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;Charm&lt;/a&gt; spells with high magnitudes lasting for very few seconds can be created very early on. These spells are more beneficial than the ones that last longer and are sold by merchants. Even if the spell lasts for one second, the duration-counter pauses when an NPC is initiated in dialogue. This is advantageous for quests that require high &lt;a href=\"disposition\"&gt;disposition&lt;/a&gt; or for purchasing &lt;a href=\"Houses%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;homes&lt;/a&gt; from the &lt;a href=\"Steward\"&gt;Steward&lt;/a&gt;s of &lt;a href=\"Count\"&gt;Count&lt;/a&gt;s and &lt;a href=\"Count\"&gt;Count&lt;/a&gt;esses, virtually rendering &lt;a href=\"Speechcraft%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;Speechcraft&lt;/a&gt; useless.\nWhen combined with a &lt;a href=\"Fortify%20Mercantile\"&gt;Fortify Mercantile&lt;/a&gt; spell with a magnitude of 100, it ensures haggling with merchants is excessively easy. Cast the charm and mercantile spell on a merchant and immediately enter dialogue with them. Click \"haggle\" and raise the price to maximum, and the merchant will purchase whatever is sold to them, every time, at a much higher price than normal. Combine this type of spell effect with &lt;a href=\"Fortify%20Personality%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;Fortify Personality&lt;/a&gt; for added ease and gold output."}

The Alteration skill is raised by using certain kinds of &lt;a href=\"Spells%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;spells&lt;/a&gt; that identify themselves as alteration spells. These alteration spells include the ability to don &lt;a href=\"Mage%20Armor\"&gt;magic armor&lt;/a&gt;, detect entities either by illumination of the area or by magically sensing their presence; the ability to temporarily paralyze, and a few special spells marked with * in the list below.\nChanges from previous games.\nSince does not feature custom spell creation, all alteration spells are now learned through &lt;a href=\"Spell%20Tomes%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;spell tomes&lt;/a&gt;. The spells &lt;a href=\"Open%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;open lock&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"levitation\"&gt;levitation&lt;/a&gt;, burden and feather make no appearance in the game.\nSkill Books.\nThe following books provide a permanent skill up to Alteration; locations are listed under each title, and may not be exhaustive. Skill books are one time use only. After a skill book is read once, reading the same book does not increase skills.\nQuests.\nThe following quests increase the Alteration skill:\nSpells.\nThe following is a complete list of Alteration spells:\nMaster (skill level 100).\nMaster spells can't be purchased initially. To unlock Master Alteration spells, the \"&lt;a href=\"Alteration%20Ritual%20Spell\"&gt;Alteration Ritual Spell&lt;/a&gt;\" quest must be completed upon reaching level 90 Alteration.\nPerks.\nThe following are &lt;a href=\"Perks%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;perks&lt;/a&gt; that become available for selection as the skill is leveled up:\n&lt;onlyinclude&gt;\n&lt;/onlyinclude&gt;\nLeveling.\nThe Alteration skill level can be increased by using these tactics:\nUsefulness.\nAlteration provides pure mages and magic dabblers alike the ability to bolster their defenses. However, until expert level, Alteration is purely defensive. In addition, Alteration normally levels slowly because the \"flesh\" spells will rarely be cast more than once during each combat encounter. Their high cost also means that pure mages sacrifice tons of offensive potential by casting a flesh spell at the beginning of combat. In general, Alteration spells are most useful for a character who in the long term wants to be more resistant to magic (the alteration perks magic resistance and atronach), a character planning to be able to paralyze their foes (a powerful effect), a pure mage who is not confident in their ability to avoid weapons based attacks and so uses flesh spells, or a warrior who dabbles in magic. They may also be useful to rogue-like characters using light armor to compensate for lower armor ratings, though such characters may use stealth to avoid combat altogether."}

He wants to study dragon heartscales, but in order to collect them I'll first need to obtain a special dagger known as Kahvozein's Fang.\"\"\nWalkthrough.\nOnce reaching an Alteration level of 90, speaking with Tolfdir will reveal an option regarding learning more about Alteration magic. Select it, and Tolfdir will mention that he may be able to help if provided with dragon heartscales. However, the only weapon able to procure heart scales from a &lt;a href=\"Dragons%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;dragon&lt;/a&gt; is &lt;a href=\"Kahvozein%27s%20Fang\"&gt;Kahvozein's Fang&lt;/a&gt;, prompting Tolfdir to ask the Dragonborn to retrieve the weapon.\nIs there anything more I can learn about Alteration magic? \"At this very moment? No. Well, I've been working on something. An improvement on the Ebonyflesh spell. I've made progress, but then hit a snag. I think perhaps you could help.\"\nFinding Kahvozein's Fang.\nDue to \"Skyrim's\" radiant quest system, there are several locations in which the dagger may spawn. It will most likely be in a &lt;a href=\"Nordic%20tomb\"&gt;Nordic tomb&lt;/a&gt; with a &lt;a href=\"Dragon%20Priests%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Dragon Priest&lt;/a&gt; present, such as &lt;a href=\"Volskygge\"&gt;Volskygge&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Ragnvald\"&gt;Ragnvald&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"High%20Gate%20Ruins\"&gt;High Gate Ruins&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"Forelhost%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Forelhost&lt;/a&gt;.\nRetrieving the Heartscales.\nOnce\u00a0Kahvozein's Fang is obtained, it must be equipped in the right hand (it does not work when equipped in the left hand), then examine a dragon's corpse (it does not matter whether it has been recently slain or previously killed). This will eventually yield dragon heartscales.\nIt is possible to gather heartscales from a dragon that has been turned to ash.\nIt is not possible to gather heartscales from the &lt;a href=\"Skeletal%20Dragon%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Skeletal Dragon&lt;/a&gt; during the quest \"&lt;a href=\"The%20Staff%20of%20Magnus%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;The Staff of Magnus&lt;/a&gt;.\" The same applies to &lt;a href=\"Krosulhah\"&gt;Krosulhah&lt;/a&gt; that appears in .\nConclusion.\nBring the heartscales back to Tolfdir, and he will reward the Dragonborn's efforts with the &lt;a href=\"Spell%20Tomes%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;spell tome&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Dragonhide\"&gt;Dragonhide&lt;/a&gt;, which allows one to ignore 80% of all physical damage for 30 seconds. In addition, the spell tome &lt;a href=\"Mass%20Paralysis\"&gt;Mass Paralysis&lt;/a&gt; becomes available for purchase upon completion of the quest.\nHere's your heartscale. \"Wonderful, Just wonderful! And it's just as I suspected. The energies need to be channelled back through the nexus a second and third time... And that's it. I certainly think you deserve the first copy of the tome. Use it well!\""}

While their achievements are admired by the races of Tamriel, their culture is considered less important, as they focus on their glories in martial tradition and their mastery of sorcery and enchantments.\nThe feudal monarchy in place in Summerset has a long history of conflict and instability, and the Altmer believe themselves to be proud, wise, and beautiful, and believe that their pure blood protects them from disease and makes them superior spellcrafters. Over hundreds of years, the Altmer have formed pure bloodlines. They reproduce as often and as quickly as humans do, but always killed nine out of ten of their newborn in order to keep their bloodlines pure. Uniforms and high speech are also regarded as important in Altmeri culture, and their wildlife and trees have, much like the Altmer themselves, been bred to be as perfect as they can be.\nNecromancy and the undead.\nIn regards to &lt;a href=\"Necromancy\"&gt;Necromancy&lt;/a&gt;, it is legal for some Altmer to practice the art. Those of the most respected noble and scholarly families have permission to study the dead in the open, focusing on research on how to further extend their lives. Non-Altmer caught performing necromancy in the Summerset Isles are punished in some of the worst possible ways.\nThe Altmer see the &lt;a href=\"undead\"&gt;undead&lt;/a&gt; with the same prejudice as they do wild animals. They acknowledge that certain forms of undead, such as the &lt;a href=\"Lich\"&gt;Lich&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Wraith\"&gt;Wraith&lt;/a&gt;, or &lt;a href=\"Vampire\"&gt;Vampire&lt;/a&gt; hold power, and mildly admire it. Even so, the Altmer always remains guarded in the presence of such entities, as they always desire something from the living. In order to learn from the undead, an Altmer must maintain certain appearances. They must show humility to the undead and speak to them like they are their elders. They must also show intelligence, to make their undead host know they are not to be trifled with. The third and last appearance that the Altmer must show is discipline. If the undead host is willing to enter in conversation, the Altmer must carefully pick their questions, as an undead will only provide knowledge willingly, or not at all.\nThe Altmer venerate their ancestors by respecting the passage of these beings from this world to the next. Altmer believe it to be cruel and unnatural to keep the spirits of the dead on &lt;a href=\"Nirn\"&gt;Nirn&lt;/a&gt;. To display body parts of ancestors in ghost fences or ash pits is considered barbaric by the Altmer. Instead, the Altmer inter their dead.\nArchitecture and language.\nAltmeri architecture is high and graceful. Showing curved gables and steeples which are strong and pointed to emphasize height, Altmer architecture tries to contrast its structures from those of the other races. Rather than seeking innovation, the Altmer seek refinement, being hesitant to perform large-scale changes, but are willing to tinker with their arts. As a result, their architecture shows precision, harmony, and orthodox compositions, which are often in repetition.\nThe Altmer consider language, specifically the written word, of critical importance, as it not only preserves their history, but also captures and defines their lineage, ensuring that every elf knows their place in the hierarchy. Because of this, Altmeri society is one of the most well-structured in Tamriel, which according to the scholar-priests of Summerset is the will of &lt;a href=\"Xarxes\"&gt;Xarxes&lt;/a&gt; himself. These priests are also said to preserve an ancient tongue which was long forgotten by the rest of Tamriel.\nSociety.\nAfter the society of the Altmer grew, a hierarchy came into place. In this hierarchy, the people were put in classes, with the higher classes holding the most power. These classes are the following, from highest to lowest: The Wise, teachers and priests, artists, princes, warriors, landowners, merchants, workers, and finally beasts. The social class of the beasts were attributed to those below workers, such as the &lt;a href=\"goblin\"&gt;goblin&lt;/a&gt;s the Altmer enslave to perform duties which they consider themselves to be too high for.\nAltmer were still said to have humanoid slaves during the seventh century of the &lt;a href=\"Second%20Era\"&gt;Second Era&lt;/a&gt;, and Summerset and Valenwood alike had abolished the practice long before they were conquered by the Empire in 2E 895.\nAltmer who engage in dialogue and disagree with their opposition, prefer to settle the affairs through talking. Long conversations and thinking, combined with wine and fellowship often have the result of settling the affair. In the event where talk does not have a satisfying outcome, matters are put to an end by means of a duel. The rules of such duels are the following:\nWhoever comes out victorious must engage with their opponent in a humble and courteous fashion, providing them with physicians, aid, and other services to heal their wounds. The defeated is required to admit error, and request forgiveness. This way, both parties finish the conflict with their honor intact, a good thing, as the Altmer consider honor the most important thing on Nirn. The Altmer are also known for celebrating a holiday known as the feat of immortal subterfuge.\nReligion.\nCreation.\nThe Altmer believe that &lt;a href=\"Anu\"&gt;Anu&lt;/a&gt; encompasses all things, and created &lt;a href=\"Anuiel\"&gt;Anuiel&lt;/a&gt; so he might know himself, as Anuiel was his soul and the soul of all things. Anuiel had self-reflection, and as such, he had to differentiate between his forms, attributes, and intellects. As such, &lt;a href=\"Sithis\"&gt;Sithis&lt;/a&gt; was born, the sum of all of Anuiel's limitations. Because of this, Anuiel became a variety of things, and this interplay is known as the &lt;a href=\"Aurbis\"&gt;Aurbis&lt;/a&gt;.\nOriginally the Aurbis was confusing and turbulent, as Anuiel had to adapt to his role. In order for Anuiel to know himself, he created Auriel, which was the soul of his soul. Auriel went through the Aurbis in a form known as time. With the creation of time, other aspects began to understand their limitations and natures, taking names. One of these was more of a limit than nature, and was known as Lorkhan.\nLorkhan entered every aspect of Anuiel, and planted an idea which was based on limitation. Outlining a plan to create a soul for the Aurbis, a place where the aspects of aspects would be able to self-reflect. Because of his words, he gained many followers, including Auriel, who was told by Lorkhan he would become the king of this new world. As such, they created &lt;a href=\"Mundus\"&gt;Mundus&lt;/a&gt;, where their aspects would live and became the &lt;a href=\"et%27Ada\"&gt;et'Ada&lt;/a&gt;. However, Lorkhan had tricked the spirits. The world held many limitations, because of which it hardly belonged to Anu. Mundus was the House of Sithis. Many of the et'Ada vanished as their aspects began to die off, while some attempted to escape, like Magnus, which is the reason why magic has no limitations. Other et'Ada, like Y'ffre, became the Ehlnofey, so the world would not die. Deities had to marry and make children in order to survive, with each generation being weaker than the one before. The &lt;a href=\"Aldmer\"&gt;Aldmer&lt;/a&gt; believe to be descendants from this line. Lorkhan made armies out of the weakest souls and created Men.\nWith the world being created, Auriel pleaded to Anu to take them back, but Anu refused. His soul granted Auriel his Bow and Shield, so that Auriel might be able to save the Aldmer from Men. Some of the Aldmer had already fallen, such as the &lt;a href=\"Chimer\"&gt;Chimer&lt;/a&gt;, who listened to the et'Ada who were tainted, or the Bosmer, who had taken Mannish wives. Auriel did not have the means to save Atmora, and it was lost to men. The Elves of Atmora were chased south and east to &lt;a href=\"Aldmeris\"&gt;Aldmeris&lt;/a&gt;, with Lorkhan being close behind them, shattering the land. Trinimac eventually knocked down Lorkhan in front of his army, and took out his &lt;a href=\"Heart%20of%20Lorkhan\"&gt;heart&lt;/a&gt;. The armies of Men took the body of Lorkhan and swore blood vengeance on elvenkind for all time. When Trinimac and Auriel attempted to destroy the heart they were unable to do so. So Auriel fastened the heart to an arrow and shot it across Tamriel.\n&lt;a href=\"Altmeri%20Pantheon\"&gt;Pantheon&lt;/a&gt;.\nA large number of the Altmer living on Summerset worship &lt;a href=\"Auri-El\"&gt;Auri-El&lt;/a&gt;, the soul of &lt;a href=\"Anui-El\"&gt;Anui-El&lt;/a&gt;, who in turn is the soul of &lt;a href=\"Anu\"&gt;Anu&lt;/a&gt;. The majority of the Altmer believe that Auri-El and Akatosh are one in the same, just with different names, and with different aspects because of their own cultural beliefs.\nBefore the Altmer came to worship their pantheon, they worshipped their ancestors. This would change as their society grew and advanced. A number of the elders of Altmer society opposed this change and formed the &lt;a href=\"Psijics\"&gt;Psijics&lt;/a&gt;, the keepers of the Old Ways of Aldmeris. These Psijics moved to the Isle of &lt;a href=\"Artaeum\"&gt;Artaeum&lt;/a&gt;, separated from what they considered the corruption of Altmer society. Often times they would return to the land as advisors, but Summerset was no longer considered by them to be their home.\nThe Altmer Pantheon consists of the following deities:\nAuri-El is the Elven version of Akatosh, serving as the chief of most Aldmeri Pantheons. Altmer and Bosmer alike claim to be direct descendants of the god. The Altmer consider his only moment of weakness to be the time he aided Lorkhan in creating the Mortal plane, which removed the Altmer from the spirit worlds. To compensate, Auri-El commanded the Aldmer against the armies of Lorkhan, defeating him and establishing the first kingdoms of elvenkind, &lt;a href=\"Atmora\"&gt;Atmora&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Old%20Ehlnofey\"&gt;Old Ehlnofey&lt;/a&gt;, also known as Aldmeris.\nMagnus is the god of sorcery in the Pantheon of the Altmer. He withdrew from the creation of the world at the last moment, which cost him dearly. What remained of his power in the world is known and controlled by mortals as magic. One story states that it was Magnus who created the schematics and diagrams required to construct the mortal plane, while it was Lorkhan's idea. He is most commonly represented by a staff, but also by a telescope, or an astrolabe.\nTrinimac was a deity worshipped by the early Aldmer, and was, in some places, more popular than Auri-El. Serving as a warrior spirit, he originally led the armies of Elves against Men. His shape has been taken over by &lt;a href=\"Boethiah\"&gt;Boethiah&lt;/a&gt;, which resulted in a number of Aldmer listening to the Daedra. Trinimac vanished after this, and was replaced by &lt;a href=\"Malacath\"&gt;Malacath&lt;/a&gt;, which the Altmer portray as the dangers of the influence of the &lt;a href=\"Dunmer\"&gt;Dunmer&lt;/a&gt;.\nY'ffre is revered as the spirit of \"the now.\" After the creation of the world, the Elves believed everything to have been in chaos, with mortals shifting constantly between the forms of plants, animals, and then mortals again. Y'ffre became the first of the Earth Bones, and established the laws of nature, which provided the mortals with safety.\nThe god of ancestry and secret knowledge. Originally he served as a scribe to Auri-El, keeping track of every Aldmeri accomplishment, regardless of their size, since the beginning of time. He is said to have created his wife, &lt;a href=\"Oghma\"&gt;Oghma&lt;/a&gt;, from his favorite moments.\nMara is one of the deities worshipped across almost all Tamriel. The goddess found her origins during the &lt;a href=\"Mythic%20Era\"&gt;Mythic&lt;/a&gt; times as a goddess of fertility. The Altmer consider her the wife of Auri-El.\nStendarr is the god of compassion and righteous rule. Early Altmeri legends depict Stendarr as the apologist of Men.\nSyrabane is considered an Aldmeri god-ancestor of magic. He aided &lt;a href=\"Bendu%20Olo\"&gt;Bendu Olo&lt;/a&gt; during the fall of the &lt;a href=\"Sload\"&gt;Sload&lt;/a&gt;. Through using his magical ring, Syrabane was able to save many from the &lt;a href=\"Thrassian%20Plague\"&gt;Thrassian Plague&lt;/a&gt;. He was also known as the Apprentices' God, when the &lt;a href=\"Mages%20Guild\"&gt;Mages Guild&lt;/a&gt; still existed, as he was a favorite for its younger members.\nCults.\nThe Altmer also have Cults for a number of deities. These are the following:\nPhynaster is a hero-god of the Summerset Isles, and taught the Altmer how to live another hundred years.\nAlso known as the Doom Drum, he convinced the Original Spirits to create the mortal plane. After the world was created, Lorkhan was separated from his divine center. His place in the creation of the world has a variety of interpretations, but the Altmer believe he is the most unholy of the gods, as he broke their connection to the spirit plane. He is almost always considered an enemy of the Aldmer, and a hero of early Mankind.\nMilitary.\nAltmeri &lt;a href=\"weapons\"&gt;weapons&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"armor\"&gt;armor&lt;/a&gt; strive for simple elegance, with flowing lines reflecting forms from the natural world, such as patterns in the shapes of abstract birds, flowers, and seashells. Armor often being embossed in order to represent scales or feather, with even cuirasses and helmets being stylized with wings or beaks. The weapons used by the Altmer are often thin and made from exotic ores and minerals as part of the forging process, which can be as advanced as Altmeri speech is. The Altmer of every social class has an open disdain for the usage of iron, steel, and any other material commonly used by the races of the mainland of Tamriel. The armor and weapons of the Altmer have a sturdy elegance. Fanciful materials are common on Summerset, glass is considered the most impressive when used for swords or axes. Items crafted with glass are surprisingly robust, and always alluring. The weapons are light, and milky green in color, though the blades require constant and careful sharpening. The Altmer also train goblins in the ways of war in order to reinforce their main armies.\nDue to the bounty of rare and primarily crystalline minerals on Summerset, a variety of the crafted arms of the Altmer are enchanted, such as weaponry being embedded in glass details, with golden pommels, and with eagle wings and heads. The Altmer also use winged bows, though the Altmer do not use the leather of wild animals, instead preferring to use the most pliable leather from specifically bred guar. Altmer favor weapons which match themselves, elongated, barbed, and coated in gold. For a long time, the way to craft this kind of armor was a closely guarded secret, until the method was made public by a Dunmer slave.\nThe Altmer are famous for their prowess at sea. Due to &lt;a href=\"Maormer\"&gt;Maormer&lt;/a&gt; invasions during the First and Second Era, the Altmer were forced to build a strong fleet to keep the invaders at bay. The Altmer are known to excel at their skill at naval warfare. Despite this long history of naval prowess, during the &lt;a href=\"War%20of%20the%20Isle\"&gt;War of the Isle&lt;/a&gt; Altmeri naval prowess had decreased, which forced them to call upon the aid of the Psijic Order and the Empire in order to prevent the Maormer from taking over. The ships of the Altmer are said to be thin and swan-necked.\nHistory.\nThe Altmer believe their history starts after Nirn was created. They believe that the &lt;a href=\"Ehlnofey\"&gt;Ehlnofey&lt;/a&gt;, who landed on Nirn, were the ancestors of the Elven people. These Ehlnofey were divided in two kinds, the Old Ehlnofey and the Wandering Ehlnofey, and would engage in war with one another, a war that reshaped Nirn. When the war had concluded, the continents of Tamriel were formed, and the Ehlnofey turned into the elven races. The Aldmer afterwards moved in on Tamriel, with the predecessors of the Altmer settling on Summerset and building the &lt;a href=\"Crystal%20Tower\"&gt;Crystal Tower&lt;/a&gt;, and originally held close relations with the &lt;a href=\"Ayleid\"&gt;Ayleid&lt;/a&gt;s of Cyrodiil. The isles of Summerset are considered to be the birthplace of civilization and magic.\nAltmer society in its beginning was centered around agriculture and was politically egalitarian. Their religious beliefs had remained the same as they had been in Aldmeris, as they continued to worship their ancestors. The elves would eventually form up and create the Crystal Tower as a monument to the spirits, both living and dead, of all elven peoples. The tower housed a number of graves of the original elven settlers.\nAs exploration of mainland Tamriel advanced, many Aldmer would leave Summerset. Especially those among the worker class sought to settle the rest of the continent, believing they could live as kings instead of their low classes on Summerset itself. Saint &lt;a href=\"Veloth\"&gt;Veloth&lt;/a&gt; was one of these migrants.\n&lt;a href=\"Second%20Era\"&gt;Second Era&lt;/a&gt;.\nDuring the &lt;a href=\"Alliance%20War\"&gt;Alliance War&lt;/a&gt; of the Second Era, the &lt;a href=\"First%20Aldmeri%20Dominion\"&gt;First Aldmeri Dominion&lt;/a&gt; was founded. During this time, many an Altmer felt like the Dominion did not stand for the ideals of the Altmer, and as such, opposed it. As such, many joined the &lt;a href=\"Veiled%20Heritance\"&gt;Veiled Heritance&lt;/a&gt;, a group of Altmer nationalists which sought to end the Dominion.\nThe Altmer would later form the &lt;a href=\"Second%20Aldmeri%20Dominion\"&gt;Second Aldmeri Dominion&lt;/a&gt; around the time of &lt;a href=\"Tiber%20Septim\"&gt;Tiber Septim&lt;/a&gt;. The Thalmor had aided Bosmer factions in uniting Summerset and Valenwood in one union to oppose the rise of the Third Empire. The Dominion would eventually be conquered by Tiber Septim, through usage of the &lt;a href=\"Numidium\"&gt;Numidium&lt;/a&gt;.\n&lt;a href=\"Third%20Era\"&gt;Third Era&lt;/a&gt;.\nAfter being conquered by, and assimilated into the Empire, the Altmer would survive and continue to live in horror for over 300 years after Septim's passing. Their pride had been heavily damaged as a result of his conquest.\nDuring the War of the Isle in &lt;a href=\"3E%20110\"&gt;3E 110&lt;/a&gt;, the Maormer attempted to conquer Summerset, and came close to achieving victory. The Altmer had to resort to asking the Empire and the Psijics for aid in order to defeat their enemy. During the Imperial Simulacrum, the Altmer invaded Valenwood in what is known as the &lt;a href=\"War%20of%20the%20Blue%20Divide\"&gt;War of the Blue Divide&lt;/a&gt;. The Altmer were only successful in conquering a small part of the coastline of Valenwood. This reduced strength in Altmer society had caused many Altmer, the young in particular, to rethink what it means to be a High Elf.\nAs of &lt;a href=\"3E%20432\"&gt;3E 432&lt;/a&gt;, the Altmer had been at peace with the other peoples of Tamriel for a few years. Their society was strongly divided, and this division finds its origins in the &lt;a href=\"Tiber%20Wars\"&gt;Tiber Wars&lt;/a&gt;, when Tiber Septim conquered the province, which shook Altmer society. For eras, the Altmer believed in Altmer supremacy over the other races, and cultures, of Tamriel. While for a long time this thinking was justified, after the province was conquered by the Third Empire, Altmer began to doubt this belief system. Especially among the young Altmer took a critical view of the ancient hierarchy of Altmer society, while also being critical of the strong xenophobia present among the Altmer. While dissidents had always existed, they were always exiled in the past. This time, however, a significant portion of the Altmer had become dissidents, and desired social change.\nThe result of this new thinking was taken into some use in Summerset. New cultures and races were accepted into Summerset, and these peoples were also permitted to take positions which had been forbidden for them a century prior, such as the positions of Queens and Kings.\nAn extremist movement would also take form, however. Known as the Beautiful, they originated with the idea that Summerset had to let go of the past in order to advance as a society. This group would eventually turn radical, and became dedicated to destroying the monuments of the Altmer, such as the Crystal Tower. While attempts had been made by this gang to destroy the Tower, all had failed. Other attempts at vandalizing historical sites were more successful, however. Approaches on the living Altmer also grew, as the Beautiful murdered the daughter of the King of Shimmerene.\nIn contrast to the Beautiful, some Altmer youths opposed moving forward, and wanted to embrace their heritage. The young of Summerset considered the Psijic Order to be popular, with more members having joined the order in two years time than had joined in the past thousand years.\n&lt;a href=\"Oblivion%20Crisis\"&gt;Oblivion Crisis&lt;/a&gt;.\nIn &lt;a href=\"3E%20433\"&gt;3E 433&lt;/a&gt; the Oblivion Crisis, known as the Great Anguish by the Altmer, broke out. Oblivion Gates appeared all over Tamriel, including Summerset. Many Altmer tried to escape by boat, but the sea caused many ships to sink. In order to better fight back the hordes of Oblivion, the Crystal Tower was forced to give the Thalmor more authority and power. The Thalmor had always been a powerful faction within the Isles, though always a minority of the population. As a province, the Summerset Isles were more successful against the forces of Oblivion than Cyrodiil was, and the Thalmor played a major role in the survival of Summerset. The Thalmor consider themselves the \"saviors of Mer\" because of this.\nNear the end of the Crisis, many Altmer refugees sought shelter at the Crystal Tower. Altmer wizards fought back the Daedric hordes here, but the Tower would ultimately end up being destroyed by the Daedra of &lt;a href=\"Mehrunes%20Dagon\"&gt;Mehrunes Dagon&lt;/a&gt;, while the defenders of the Tower fought until its collapse. When &lt;a href=\"Martin%20Septim\"&gt;Martin Septim&lt;/a&gt; put a stop the Daedric Hordes by defeating Mehrunes Dagon in the &lt;a href=\"Imperial%20City\"&gt;Imperial City&lt;/a&gt;, the Altmer were eagerly looking for people to thank for putting an end to the crisis. Being unaware of the deeds of the &lt;a href=\"Hero%20of%20Kvatch\"&gt;Hero of Kvatch&lt;/a&gt; and Martin, the Altmer were quickly convinced by the Thalmor to believe they were the ones who ended the crisis. The Thalmor claimed they ended the crisis through the usage of subtle magicks, and were praised by the Altmer. With this new fame the Thalmor had, those who doubted their role in ending the crisis were quickly removed from Summerset, such as Rynandor the Bold, one of the few surviving defenders of the Crystal Tower.\n&lt;a href=\"Fourth%20Era\"&gt;Fourth Era&lt;/a&gt;.\nAfter the Thalmor had Potentate &lt;a href=\"Ocato\"&gt;Ocato&lt;/a&gt; assassinated, the &lt;a href=\"Stormcrown%20Interregnum\"&gt;Stormcrown Interregnum&lt;/a&gt; broke out. In this time period, the Thalmor took full control over Summerset, and declared its independence in &lt;a href=\"4E%2022\"&gt;4E 22&lt;/a&gt;, renaming it to Alinor, a name from before the ages of Man. While doing so, the Thalmor also overthrew the Kings and Queens of the Altmer, with large support from the people of the Isles. Shortly after this, the Thalmor began killing all of those who were not of \"the blood of the Aldmer\", while also using this rule as an excuse to kill dissidents in the land. Shortly after &lt;a href=\"Titus%20Mede\"&gt;Titus Mede&lt;/a&gt; became Emperor, the Thalmor and their Bosmer sympathizers organized a coup in Valenwood, and reformed the Aldmeri Dominion. They would then end all ties with the Empire, and remain silent for 70 years. During the &lt;a href=\"Void%20Nights\"&gt;Void Nights&lt;/a&gt;, the Dominion obtained Anequina and Pelletine as client states, further increasing their power.\n&lt;a href=\"Great%20War\"&gt;Great War&lt;/a&gt;.\nIn &lt;a href=\"4E%20171\"&gt;4E 171&lt;/a&gt;, the Great War broke out between the Aldmeri Dominion and the Empire. The Empire's military forces were greatly weakened even before the war broke out, and as such, the Dominion achieved many victories during their campaigns in Hammerfell and Cyrodiil. In &lt;a href=\"4E%20175\"&gt;4E 175&lt;/a&gt;, the war came to an end with the signing of the &lt;a href=\"White-Gold%20Concordat\"&gt;White-Gold Concordat&lt;/a&gt;, which created peace between the Empire and the Dominion. The Emperor &lt;a href=\"Titus%20Mede%20II\"&gt;Titus Mede II&lt;/a&gt; considered this peace to be necessary in order to ensure the Legions could recover.\nThe Redguards of Hammerfell, however, were unwilling to sign the Concordat. One of its terms was that a large section of Hammerfell would be given to the Dominion, and this the Redguards did not tolerate. As such, the war continued for five more years in Hammerfell, ending in &lt;a href=\"4E%20180\"&gt;4E 180&lt;/a&gt;, and left southern Hammerfell devastated. A bitter hatred has formed between the Empire and the Redguards because of this. Support for the Thalmor in Summerset at this point of time is said to be decreasing. Many Altmer have disagreed with the Thalmor, though only few dared to speak up."}

The Altmer are also extremely proficient with &lt;a href=\"magic\"&gt;magic&lt;/a&gt;, eclipsing all other races in their &lt;a href=\"Magicka%20%28Morrowind%29\"&gt;magicka&lt;/a&gt; reserves.\nPreferred play style.\nAltmer tend to be particularly adept offensive &lt;a href=\"Mage%20%28Class%29\"&gt;mages&lt;/a&gt;, primarily concentrating on destruction spells. However, the Altmer will experience quite a significant weakness to Destruction magic in the beginning, which may make gameplay harder against others who use magical attacks. Focusing on more defensive schools of magic, like Alteration, can help alleviate this over time however.\nNotable Altmer.\nThe following is a list of notable Altmer in ."}
{"id": "52910", "revid": "32911304", "url": "https://elderscrolls.fandom.com/wiki?curid=52910", "title": "Altmer (Oblivion)", "text": "The Altmer, or High Elves, are a &lt;a href=\"Races%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;race&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"Mer\"&gt;elves&lt;/a&gt; who inhabit parts of &lt;a href=\"Tamriel\"&gt;Tamriel&lt;/a&gt;. They hail from the &lt;a href=\"Summerset%20Isle\"&gt;Summerset Isle&lt;/a&gt;, are one of the ten default playable races, and are primarily known for their enhanced &lt;a href=\"magic\"&gt;magic&lt;/a&gt;al &lt;a href=\"Skills%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;abilities&lt;/a&gt;.\nPhysiology.\nAs a race, the Altmer strive to maintain the appearance of their ancestor race, the &lt;a href=\"Aldmer\"&gt;Aldmer&lt;/a&gt;, primarily through highly selective traditions surrounding marriage and reproduction. They are among the tallest of the humanoid races, taller than most humans and even most other &lt;a href=\"mer\"&gt;mer&lt;/a&gt;i races. Their skin maintains a very pale golden hue, not quite the pale white of the northern human races such as the Nords, but far lighter than the &lt;a href=\"Bosmer%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;Bosmer&lt;/a&gt;. They are slender, with prominently pointed ears and almond-shaped eyes.\nCompared with other races.\nOn average, Altmer are of a more slender build than humans, and generally not as strong. Their tall stature also makes them less &lt;a href=\"Agility%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;agile&lt;/a&gt; than their Bosmeri cousins. However, Altmer are among the most intelligent and magically-inclined races on &lt;a href=\"Nirn\"&gt;Nirn&lt;/a&gt;, surpassing even the &lt;a href=\"Bretons%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;Bretons&lt;/a&gt; in magical aptitude. This strong tie to &lt;a href=\"Magnus%20Septim\"&gt;Magnus&lt;/a&gt;, the god of magic, has the unfortunate side effect of opening Altmer up to magical attacks more than most other races. To their benefit, however, their years of selective breeding have also provided them with a strong resistance to disease.\nUsage.\nAltmer are best used to make aggressive or semi-aggressive mages. This is due to the higher &lt;a href=\"Magicka%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;magicka&lt;/a&gt; pool and higher &lt;a href=\"Destruction%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;Destruction&lt;/a&gt; skill when compared to Bretons. In , a magicka boosting &lt;a href=\"Birthsigns%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;birthsign&lt;/a&gt; is usually combined with the Altmer's own magicka boost in order to give the player a large pool of magicka. Different signs provide varying boosts in magicka with varying risks tied to the boosts. The larger the magicka boost the larger the risk or setback. The order of risk/boost size goes &lt;a href=\"The%20Mage\"&gt;Mage&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"The%20Apprentice\"&gt;Apprentice&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"The%20Atronach\"&gt;Atronach&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe Mage.\n&lt;a href=\"The%20Mage\"&gt;The Mage&lt;/a&gt; Altmers with this stone provides a high elf with slightly more magicka than a Breton/Mage.\nThe Apprentice.\n&lt;a href=\"The%20Apprentice\"&gt;The Apprentice&lt;/a&gt; Altmer using this stone provides an extremely aggressive mage that can cast expensive spells many times without worry. However this advantage is offset by an extreme weakness to magical attacks. With this build a lot of players like to add skills that help boost endurance, which in turn boosts maximum health. Without the health boosting skills these mages can die in one hit if a spell is either cast at them, or reflected back at them.\nThe Atronach.\n&lt;a href=\"The%20Atronach\"&gt;The Atronach&lt;/a&gt; Altmer has the largest magicka pool in the game, but cannot regenerate magicka. At early levels this type of mage must rely on &lt;a href=\"Welkynd%20Stone%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;Welkynd Stones&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"absorb\"&gt;absorb&lt;/a&gt;ed &lt;a href=\"Spells%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;spells&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Potions%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;potions&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Staves%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;staves&lt;/a&gt;, and primitive &lt;a href=\"Alchemy%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;Alchemy&lt;/a&gt;. At higher levels, however, this type of mage can be extremely aggressive and extremely resistant to magical attacks. A few enchanted items with \"absorb spell\" will help boost the &lt;a href=\"Absorb%20Magicka%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;Magicka absorption&lt;/a&gt; rate up to 100%, fully offsetting all of the Altmers' weaknesses.\nEquipment.\nPurchasing the &lt;a href=\"Hands%20of%20the%20Atronach\"&gt;Hands of the Atronach&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Heavy%20Armor%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;heavy gauntlets&lt;/a&gt; is advised for Altmeri characters of all classes. These gauntlets add 20% &lt;a href=\"Resist%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;resistances&lt;/a&gt; to &lt;a href=\"Frost%20Damage%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;frost&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Fire%20Damage%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;fire&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Shock%20Damage%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;shock&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Damage%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;damage&lt;/a&gt;. These gauntlets can be purchased from the &lt;a href=\"Mystic%20Emporium\"&gt;Mystic Emporium&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;a href=\"Imperial%20City%2C%20Market%20District\"&gt;Imperial City, Market District&lt;/a&gt; for 7,000 ."}

They see themselves, perhaps justifiably, as the ruling race of Tamriel. They are a highly cultured people, known for their breathtaking architecture and massive libraries of histories and creative works. They tend to be isolationists, largely remaining on Summerset Isle, and only emerge when they perceive a great threat to their homeland. They are powerful mages and warriors, and the de facto leaders of the Aldmeri Dominion.\"\"\nCulture.\nRoyal family.\nThe Altmer consider themselves to be descended in an unbroken line from the Divines who created &lt;a href=\"Nirn\"&gt;Nirn&lt;/a&gt;, but none more so than the royal family of &lt;a href=\"Alinor%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Alinor&lt;/a&gt;. The King or Queen of Alinor rules over the &lt;a href=\"Summerset%20Isles%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Summerset Isles&lt;/a&gt;, basing their decisions on the precedents laid down in the &lt;a href=\"Scrolls%20of%20Praxis\"&gt;Scrolls of Praxis&lt;/a&gt;; a tradition known as\u00a0&lt;a href=\"Ceremoniarchy\"&gt;Ceremoniarchy&lt;/a&gt;. For a requisite 3,555 days, an heir to the &lt;a href=\"Throne%20of%20Alinor\"&gt;Throne of Alinor&lt;/a&gt; will study &lt;a href=\"Altmeri%20Regal%20Praxis\"&gt;Altmeri Regal Praxis&lt;/a&gt; and Ceremoniarchy at the &lt;a href=\"Sapiarchs%27%20Labyrinth\"&gt;Sapiarchs' Labyrinth&lt;/a&gt;. When the King or Queen ascends to &lt;a href=\"Aetherius\"&gt;Aetherius&lt;/a&gt;, the heir must speak an eighty-eight day &lt;a href=\"Coronation%20Liturgy\"&gt;Coronation Liturgy&lt;/a&gt; that will elevate them to the Throne of Alinor. It is the right of the eldest heir to assume the throne, as affirmed by the &lt;a href=\"High%20Justiciar\"&gt;High Justiciar&lt;/a&gt;.\nProtocol and propriety.\nImpressions are important to the Altmer, and there are several rules about proper behavior at a High Elven dinner table that guests are expected to follow. Using the wrong utensil for a certain food is considered barbaric, and utensils should never be rested on the edge of any vessel. The head of the table is always allowed to lead any discussion, and only the most prestigious attendee at any function can eat the most food. Finally, one should never watch another while they chew, or refill their own glass. It is expected of each individual to refill the glass of the diner to their left when it is low.\nPersonality and characteristics.\nMany of the Dominion's High Elves may sometimes view themselves to be superior to the other races. Some will refer to their two allying races as cannibalistic savages (Bosmer) and cat scum (Khajiit)."}

Due to their magical affinities, the Altmer excel at &lt;a href=\"The%20Mage%20Stone%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;mage-based classes&lt;/a&gt;.\nBiology.\nAs a race, some Altmer strive to maintain the appearance of their ancestor race, the &lt;a href=\"Aldmer\"&gt;Aldmer&lt;/a&gt;, primarily through highly selective traditions surrounding marriage and reproduction. They are among the tallest of the humanoid races, taller than most humans and much taller than other &lt;a href=\"mer\"&gt;mer&lt;/a&gt;. Their skin maintains a very pale gold hue, not quite the pale white of the northern human races such as &lt;a href=\"Nords%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Nords&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"Bretons%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Bretons&lt;/a&gt;, but far lighter than the &lt;a href=\"Bosmer%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Bosmer&lt;/a&gt;. They are slender, with prominently pointed ears and almond-shaped eyes that can be amber, green, or yellow. Altmer are among the most intelligent and magically-inclined races on &lt;a href=\"Nirn\"&gt;Nirn&lt;/a&gt;, surpassing even the Bretons in magical aptitude. High Elves are well known for their noble countenance, and are arrogant or disdainful more often than not when addressing humans. The Altmer are the tallest race in , standing at a scale of 1.08. However, as with all races, when in first-person mode, the camera height is 1.00.\n&lt;a href=\"Fourth%20Era\"&gt;Fourth Era&lt;/a&gt; history.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Great%20War\"&gt;Great War&lt;/a&gt;.\nBetween the &lt;a href=\"Oblivion%20Crisis\"&gt;Oblivion Crisis&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Dragon%20Crisis\"&gt;Dragon Crisis&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"Third%20Empire\"&gt;Third Empire&lt;/a&gt; is attacked by the &lt;a href=\"Aldmeri%20Dominion%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Aldmeri Dominion&lt;/a&gt;, an alliance of Elves, comprised mainly of the Altmer and their Bosmer allies. The Empire saved itself only by negotiating the &lt;a href=\"White-Gold%20Concordat\"&gt;White-Gold Concordat&lt;/a&gt;, a treaty which seems to heavily favor the Dominion, though there were great casualties on both sides. The Elves' ruling government, the &lt;a href=\"Thalmor%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Thalmor&lt;/a&gt;, are Elven supremacists determined to end the dominance of man and the Empire as a whole. They also call the Great War the \"First War with the Empire.\"\nWhite-Gold Concordat.\nThe White-Gold Concordat enables the Thalmor to move freely throughout the Empire and to suppress the worship of the Man-God Talos. Resentment toward the Altmer, and toward the Empire for surrendering to them, runs rampant in the proud &lt;a href=\"Nords%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Nords&lt;/a&gt; of Skyrim. The Thalmor are encountered several times in Skyrim, in particular in the &lt;a href=\"Thalmor%20Embassy%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Thalmor Embassy&lt;/a&gt;, located to the west of &lt;a href=\"Solitude%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Solitude&lt;/a&gt;. Thalmor Justiciars encountered on the roads are almost always antagonistic, using veiled hostility if not outright aggression when encountered, though this is usually in the form of verbal warnings.\nPresence in Skyrim.\nMany of the Altmer encountered emigrated from the Summerset Isles to become &lt;a href=\"Alchemy%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Alchemists&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Enchanting%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Enchanters&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Mage%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;mages&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Skyrim\"&gt;Skyrim&lt;/a&gt;. Others became members of the &lt;a href=\"College%20of%20Winterhold%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;College of Winterhold&lt;/a&gt;, due to their innate magical abilities. Another potential possibility is that during the rise of the Thalmor, many Altmer with strong loyalty to the Empire fled the Summerset Isles to escape the new Aldmeri Dominion. Even so, the Stormcloaks still show prejudice to the Altmer, though on a much lesser scale than their Dunmeri cousins from &lt;a href=\"Morrowind\"&gt;Morrowind&lt;/a&gt;.\nAfter the signing of the White-Gold Concordat, Altmeri presence in Skyrim have increased considerably, mostly in the form of Thalmor soldiers and Justiciars. They explicitly outlaw the worship of Talos and thus have angered a majority of Skyrim's denizens. The fact that people are being taken out of their homes or off the streets by the Thalmor with little to no evidence of actual Talos worship indicates that the reason of stamping out Talos worship may just be a front, with the real intention of sabotage and/or demoralization.\nCulture.\nOrigins and identity.\nThe Altmer are one of the oldest races on &lt;a href=\"Tamriel\"&gt;Tamriel&lt;/a&gt;, one of the earliest descendants of the original &lt;a href=\"mer\"&gt;mer&lt;/a&gt; race of Aldmer, and from there, through the &lt;a href=\"Ehlnofey\"&gt;Ehlnofey&lt;/a&gt; to the divine &lt;a href=\"et%27Ada\"&gt;et'Ada&lt;/a&gt; themselves. As a race, they are extremely proud of their Aldmeri heritage, and make a concerted effort to maintain their genetic lineage. Their name translates from the Aldmeri language as High Ones or Cultured Ones. For their part, the Altmer argue that they are the first true culture on Tamriel, and still the most civilized race, an argument that even human scholars find difficult to refute.\nHomeland.\nThe Altmer primarily live in the province of &lt;a href=\"Summerset%20Isle\"&gt;Summerset Isle&lt;/a&gt;, a large island off the southwest coast of Tamriel, which shares a border with &lt;a href=\"Valenwood\"&gt;Valenwood&lt;/a&gt;. According to their histories, their Aldmeri ancestors arrived on Summerset Isle after fleeing the catastrophic sinking of their original home continent, &lt;a href=\"Aldmeris\"&gt;Aldmeris&lt;/a&gt;. From here, splinter groups of Aldmer spread throughout Tamriel, but the Altmer remained on the Isles, acting as the nominal head of the empire of meri nations on Tamriel. For most of the &lt;a href=\"Merethic%20Era\"&gt;Merethic Era&lt;/a&gt;, the other races of elves on Tamriel acknowledged the Altmeri king as their own ruler, a practice which persisted until the founding of the &lt;a href=\"Camoran%20Dynasty\"&gt;Camoran Dynasty&lt;/a&gt; in Valenwood marked the start of the &lt;a href=\"First%20Era\"&gt;First Era&lt;/a&gt; and the beginning of the decline of Altmer-dominated Tamriel. Their influence is still felt across the continent, however, as their culture forms the basis for the religion, language, and even architecture of the Cyrodilic &lt;a href=\"Empire\"&gt;Empire&lt;/a&gt;.\nUnique gameplay.\nDue to their increased maximum &lt;a href=\"Magicka%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;magicka&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Regenerate%20Magicka%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;magicka regeneration&lt;/a&gt;, the Altmer make excellent mages and are able to better fit playstyles centred around magic. While other races can gain bonuses rivaling that of Altmer through enchanted items, perks and &lt;a href=\"Standing%20Stones\"&gt;Standing Stones&lt;/a&gt;, these inherent bonuses allow Altmer to focus on other improvements during the game's early stages.\nThe bonus of +50 magicka also allows Altmer to use five levels on boosting &lt;a href=\"Health%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;health&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"Stamina%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;stamina&lt;/a&gt; instead of magicka, if they so choose, without experiencing a deficiency in magicka that other races would face. Their racial power of regenerating magicka faster allows them to cast more spells and high-cost spells at a naturally quicker pace."}

According to some stories, Trinimac was the one to defeat Lorkhan and tear out &lt;a href=\"Heart%20of%20Lorkhan\"&gt;his heart&lt;/a&gt;. During the &lt;a href=\"Merethic%20Era\"&gt;Merethic Era&lt;/a&gt;, according to some legends, Trinimac tried to stop the &lt;a href=\"Chimer\"&gt;Chimer&lt;/a&gt; from leaving &lt;a href=\"Summerset%20Isle\"&gt;Summerset Isle&lt;/a&gt;, and was either eaten by &lt;a href=\"Boethiah\"&gt;Boethiah&lt;/a&gt;, or imitated by him. Following this, Trinimac was transformed into &lt;a href=\"Malacath\"&gt;Malacath&lt;/a&gt;, and his followers to &lt;a href=\"orc\"&gt;orcs&lt;/a&gt;, and used as a cautionary tale for the Altmer in dealing with &lt;a href=\"Daedra\"&gt;Daedra&lt;/a&gt;.\nMagnus.\nPatron deity of sorcery, Magnus withdrew from the creation of the world at the last second, tearing a hole to Aetherius, creating the sun and allowing &lt;a href=\"magicka\"&gt;magicka&lt;/a&gt; to flow into &lt;a href=\"Mundus\"&gt;Mundus&lt;/a&gt;. Some stories consider him the architect of Mundus.\nSyrabane.\nAn Aldmeri god-ancestor of magic, also known as the Apprentices' God, Syrabane aided &lt;a href=\"Bendu%20Olo\"&gt;Bendu Olo&lt;/a&gt; in the Fall of the &lt;a href=\"Sload\"&gt;Sload&lt;/a&gt;. Through use of a magical ring, Syrabane saved many from the scourge of the &lt;a href=\"Thrassian%20Plague\"&gt;Thrassian Plague&lt;/a&gt;.\nPhynaster.\nAncestor-god and protector of &lt;a href=\"Summerset%20Isles\"&gt;Summerset Isles&lt;/a&gt;. Phynaster was one of the &lt;a href=\"Aldmer\"&gt;Aldmer&lt;/a&gt; to known to have become a god. He created the &lt;a href=\"Ring%20of%20Phynaster\"&gt;Ring of Phynaster&lt;/a&gt;. Phynaster also taught the Altmer how to naturally live another hundred years by taking shorter walking strides.\nJephre.\nAlthough primarily associated with the &lt;a href=\"Bosmer\"&gt;Bosmer&lt;/a&gt;, Jephre forms part of the Altmeri Pantheon, although its precise role and associations for the Altmer are unclear.\nMara.\nAs in other cultures, Mara is known as a goddess of fertility and love, with little information available to distinguish her specific depiction in the Altmeri pantheon.\nXarxes.\nXarxes began as a scribe to Auri-El, and has kept track of all Aldmeri accomplishments since the beginning of time. Others indicate that he was an Aldmer priest who ascended to divinity. Also known as the One Who Watches, he is the keeper of merish genealogies, and as such is a keeper of status and social stability for the Altmer. He created his wife, &lt;a href=\"Oghma\"&gt;Oghma&lt;/a&gt;, from his favorite moments in history. While she is his creation, some tales indicate that he gave her some degree of free will.\nAlthough it is not mentioned in any Altmeri legends, &lt;a href=\"Hermaeus%20Mora\"&gt;Hermaeus Mora&lt;/a&gt; claims to have given Xarxes particular knowledge, which is written in the &lt;a href=\"Oghma%20Infinium\"&gt;Oghma Infinium&lt;/a&gt;, which implies some degree of fellowship between the two deities."}

He is exciting and exotic. We kissed in the moonlight. It was so romantic. I'm going to see him again tonight.\nNow I understand the true colors of the night. &lt;a href=\"Movarth%20Piquine\"&gt;Movarth&lt;/a&gt; has shown me the true black of night and the true red of blood. He has promised me a feast of blood if I do his bidding in Morthal.\n&lt;a href=\"Hroggar\"&gt;Hroggar&lt;/a&gt; was easy to seduce. Movarth said I should find a protector first, someone to watch over my coffin during the day. Hroggar is perfect.\n&lt;a href=\"Laelette%20the%20Vampire\"&gt;Laelette&lt;/a&gt; came to visit me tonight. She slaked my thirst. I've hidden her away to let her rise as my handmaiden. I've spread the rumor in town that she left to join the war. Fools.\nMovarth has confided his grand plan to me. I am to seduce the guardsman one at a time and make them my slaves. Then he and the others from the coven can descend upon Morthal and take the entire town. We won't kill them. They will become cattle for our thirst. An endless supply of blood and an entire town to protect us from the cursed sun.\nHroggar's family is becoming inconvenient. I've told Laelette to kill them all, but make it look like an accident. Hroggar must be seen as innocent if he is going to be my protector.\nThat little fool! Laelette burned Hroggar's family alive. I asked for an accident and she gave me a scandal. To make matters worse, she tried to turn his little girl, &lt;a href=\"Helgi%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Helgi&lt;/a&gt;. Except Laelette couldn't even get that right. She killed the child and left the body to burn.\nSomething is wrong with Laelette. She keeps talking about Helgi. I think her mind has snapped. She seems to think that the child can still be brought back to be her companion.\nThere is a stranger in town, looking into the fire. I'll have to be careful."}

Her latest delusion seems to be that the world is about to be attacked by some hitherto unknown force.\nWe told her that the atronachs summoned by the &lt;a href=\"Blackcaster%20Mages%20Guild\"&gt;mages&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"Elinhir%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Elinhir&lt;/a&gt; have the &lt;a href=\"Order%20of%20the%20Black%20Worm%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Worm Cult&lt;/a&gt; well in hand and the &lt;a href=\"Molag%20Bal%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Prince of Schemes&lt;/a&gt; has no hold in Craglorn, but she was not consoled by this.\nIn spite of her eccentricities, or perhaps because of them, we are all very worried about Ibrula. We have decided to wait until morning and then send a party to try to find her.\nWe have come across a small house, surrounded by all manner of magical wards. Torn pieces of a book indicate that Ibrula was here at some point, and her scrawl marks a sign at the entrance to the place, warning us away. Did she fall victim to these traps? Or did she create them? And if so, to what end? To keep us out? Or to keep something else in?\nEither way, it's apparent that Ibrula's delusion has grown worse than we'd imagined.\nAfter a few days (I've lost count, and it grows harder to concentrate the longer we're here) of trying to pass through the traps, discord has seized our search party. We are besieged by nightmares in the dark, and an incessant whispering by day.\nA voice in my head torments me with the promise of knowledge immeasurable. I suspect a Daedric presence in this place.\nMy worst suspicions are now confirmed. &lt;a href=\"Daedra%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Daedra&lt;/a&gt; have appeared, called to this place by an unknown voice, and cutting off our retreat. The twins &lt;a href=\"Maelon\"&gt;Maelon&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Melancthon\"&gt;Melancthon&lt;/a&gt; are now dead, tricked into murdering each other by whatever madness rules this place.\nAs for me, I am hopelessly lost. I believe I will die before I find Ibrula or escape this place.\nWould that we had heeded Ibrula's warning and stayed far away."}

This fortunately limits their capacity for mischief, though in only a few minutes, most of these servants can do terrible harm to their summoners as well as their enemies.\nWorshippers may bind other Daedric servants to this plane through rituals and pacts. Such arrangements result in the Daedric servant remaining on this plane indefinitely -- or at least until their bodily manifestations on this plane are destroyed, precipitating their supernatural essences back to &lt;a href=\"Oblivion%20%28Realm%29\"&gt;Oblivion&lt;/a&gt;. Whenever Daedra are encountered at Daedric ruins or in tombs, they are almost invariably long-term visitors to our plane.\nLikewise, lesser entities bound by their &lt;a href=\"Daedra%20Lords\"&gt;Daedra Lords&lt;/a&gt; into weapons and armor may be summoned for brief periods, or may persist indefinitely, so long as they are not destroyed and banished. The class of &lt;a href=\"Bound%20Weapons\"&gt;bound weapons&lt;/a&gt; and bound armors summoned by Temple followers and conjurers are examples of short-term bindings; &lt;a href=\"Daedric%20artifacts\"&gt;Daedric artifacts&lt;/a&gt; like &lt;a href=\"Mehrunes%20Razor\"&gt;Mehrunes Razor&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Mask%20of%20Clavicus%20Vile\"&gt;Mask of&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Clavicus%20Vile\"&gt;Clavicus Vile&lt;/a&gt; are examples of long-term bindings.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Tribunal%20Temple\"&gt;Tribunal Temple&lt;/a&gt; of Morrowind has incorporated the veneration of Daedra as lesser spirits subservient to the immortal Almsivi, the Triune godhead of &lt;a href=\"Almalexia\"&gt;Almalexia&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Sotha%20Sil\"&gt;Sotha Sil&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Vivec\"&gt;Vivec&lt;/a&gt;. These subordinate Daedra are divided into the Good Daedra and the Bad Daedra. The Good Daedra have willingly submitted to the authority of Almsivi; the Bad Daedra are rebels who defy Almsivi -- treacherous kin who are more often adversaries than allies.\nThe Good Daedra are &lt;a href=\"Boethiah\"&gt;Boethiah&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Azura\"&gt;Azura&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Mephala\"&gt;Mephala&lt;/a&gt;. The &lt;a href=\"hunger\"&gt;hunger&lt;/a&gt; is a powerful and violent lesser Daedra associated with Boethiah, Father of Plots -- a sinuous, long-limbed, long-tailed creature with a beast-skulled head, noted for its paralyzing touch and its ability to disintegrate weapons and armor. The winged twilight is a messenger of Azura, Goddess of Dusk and Dawn. &lt;a href=\"Winged%20Twilight\"&gt;Winged Twilight&lt;/a&gt; resemble the feral harpies of the West, though the feminine aspects of the winged twilights are more ravishing, and their long, sharp, hooked tails are immeasurably more deadly. Spider Daedra are the servants of Mephala, taking the form of spider-humanoid centaurs, with a naked upper head, torso, and arms of human proportions, mounted on the eight legs and armored carapace of a giant spider. Unfortunately, these Daedra are so fierce and irrational that they cannot be trusted to heed the commands of the Spinner. As a consequence, few sorcerers are willing to either summon or bind such creatures in Morrowind.\nThe &lt;a href=\"House%20of%20Troubles\"&gt;Bad Daedra&lt;/a&gt; are &lt;a href=\"Mehrunes%20Dagon\"&gt;Mehrunes Dagon&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Malacath\"&gt;Malacath&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Sheogorath\"&gt;Sheogorath&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Molag%20Bal\"&gt;Molag Bal&lt;/a&gt;. Three lesser Daedra are associated with Mehrunes Dagon: the agile and pesky &lt;a href=\"scamp\"&gt;scamp&lt;/a&gt;, the ferocious and beast-like &lt;a href=\"clannfear\"&gt;clannfear&lt;/a&gt;, and the noble and deadly &lt;a href=\"dremora\"&gt;dremora&lt;/a&gt;. The crocodile-headed humanoid Daedra called the &lt;a href=\"Daedroth\"&gt;Daedroth&lt;/a&gt; is a servant of Molag Bal, while the giant but dim-witted &lt;a href=\"ogrim\"&gt;ogrim&lt;/a&gt; is a servant of Malacath. Sheogorath's lesser Daedra, the &lt;a href=\"Golden%20Saint\"&gt;Golden Saint&lt;/a&gt;s, a half-clothed human female in appearance, is highly resistant to magic and a dangerous spellcaster.\nAnother type of lesser Daedra often encountered in Morrowind is the &lt;a href=\"Atronach\"&gt;Atronach&lt;/a&gt;, or Elemental Daedra. Atronachs have no binding kinship or alignments with the Daedra Lords, serving one realm or another at whim, shifting sides according to seduction, compulsion, or opportunity."}

The cave itself is moderately sized, and contains some water-filled areas, including one part where the Dragonborn can be briefly completely submerged. The cave is poorly lit in some areas. If the cave is accessed when the quest \"Touching the Sky\" is active, it leads to &lt;a href=\"Darkfall%20Passage\"&gt;Darkfall Passage&lt;/a&gt;.\nWalkthrough.\nInside the entrance there is a winding passage and a frostbite spider. The passage directly behind the spider (it will be covered in webs, and can be cleared using any weapon/destruction magic), can be accessed further into the cave, and acts as an exit path, allowing the Dragonborn to leave from the furthest reaches of the initial cave. At the end of the short tunnel past the spider is a bridge over a dark chasm, leading to a dead end with a table, a &lt;a href=\"Pickaxe%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;pickaxe&lt;/a&gt;, and two moonstone ore veins.\nAfter reaching this point there is no turning back, as crossing the bridge again will cause it to collapse, sending the Dragonborn (and any &lt;a href=\"Followers%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;followers&lt;/a&gt; they might have who are on the bridge), plunging into a rapidly flowing stream below. The stream swiftly carries the Dragonborn deeper into the cave system, eventually bringing them into a frostbite spider den. The Dragonborn should head north from here (killing or &lt;a href=\"Sneak%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;sneaking&lt;/a&gt; past any frostbite spiders which may appear), eventually reaching a slope to the north, which leads to a path further into the cave, and a bridge across the stream to the east which leads to a Giant frostbite spider lair and a chest containing random loot.\nProceed along the northwards path further into the cave, which immediately forks, providing two parallel paths. The Dragonborn can take either path, as they merge into one again a short distance later. Further along the path, there is a camp, occupied by a dead &lt;a href=\"Bretons%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Breton&lt;/a&gt;, who has the &lt;a href=\"Darkfall%20Cave%20Note\"&gt;Darkfall Cave Note&lt;/a&gt;, which details a massacre that occurred in the cave, and the presence of trolls further in to the cave network. In the back (north) of the camp there is a bed, and behind that is a pull-chain which opens a path directly to the end of the initial cave and the &lt;a href=\"Chantry%20of%20Auri-El\"&gt;Chantry of Auri-El&lt;/a&gt;, in which &lt;a href=\"Knight-Paladin%20Gelebor\"&gt;Knight-Paladin Gelebor&lt;/a&gt; can be found if the quest Touching the Sky has been started. The path leading west from the camp is an exit path, leading to a small passageway and a spiral staircase that leads to a pull-chain activated door which brings the Dragonborn to the beginning of the dungeon, where the first frostbite spider is located. Finally, the path leading east from the camp leads down a passageway, with a trip wire which triggers a rock slide trap. Further along, the path forks, and either path can be taken. The paths rejoin a short distance later at a large water-filled cavern, containing two trolls and a chest containing random loot to the north. The Dragonborn can kill or sneak past the trolls to the west, leading to Knight-Paladin Gelebor (if the relevant quest has been started).\nGelebor, potentially one of the last Snow Elves remaining in the whole land of Skyrim, can be found at the very end of the initial cave, within the &lt;a href=\"Chantry%20of%20Auri-El\"&gt;Chantry of Auri-El&lt;/a&gt; if the quest Touching the Sky has been started. If the quest was not started before the Dragonborn entered the cave, Gelebor will not appear, and one can take a passageway opened with a pull chain in the south of the camp (the same pull-chain activated doorway in the Breton camp) and from there take the westward path that leads to the exit."}

A pool in the eastern part of the room leads down to an underwater tunnel about half-way down the eastern rock face, which goes east into a secret room containing minor loot, a couple of &lt;a href=\"Gleamblossom\"&gt;Gleamblossom&lt;/a&gt; plants, some &lt;a href=\"Glowing%20Mushroom%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Glowing Mushrooms&lt;/a&gt;, and a skeleton containing \"&lt;a href=\"Darkfall%20Passage%20Note%20I\"&gt;Darkfall Passage Note I&lt;/a&gt;\". It may be advisable to turn to the brightness up if one is unable to see the tunnel in the murky depths.\nFalmer village.\nGoing back through the underwater tunnel to the low-ceilinged cave, cross to the other side of the room, along the western wall is an opening which leads down another tunnel towards a Falmer village. On the northern side of the village is a Falmer tent with a walkway in front, inside this tent is a table with several potions on it. The large tent with the Chaurus figure atop it, on the western side of the village, besides the waterfall, contains a Falmer chest.\nFrom the village, one should pass through the waterfall, on the other side there is a hidden door to the south, which cannot be opened from this side, whilst the path to the north leads to a small gathering of Falmer buildings, with at least one Falmer to be found. In the middle of the clearing is a clearly-visible chest surrounded by Gleamblossom. Be aware that this chest is trapped; when the chest is opened two Falmer swinging claw traps drop from the Falmer bridge above the chest and are capable of causing massive damage as well as alerting the nearby Falmer if they still live.\nIt is possible to fall through the waterfall, which leads to a secret path containing a chest and a skeleton containing minor loot. A path from the chest leads to the hidden door to the south of the waterfall, which is opened with an illuminated pullchain.\nDeep tunnels.\nCrossing over the aforementioned bridge leads to a fenced-off area with a ramp to its north. Within this fenced area is a chest in the southern tent and a table with random potions in the northern one. The ramp to the north serves merely to bypass this area, making it possible to sneak past the Falmer on the other side. From this area, a room with a large crystalline formation is visible, the path around this formation heads south, then bends to the east, ending in a Chaurus pen. Beyond this pen is a Falmer tent, which contains a chest, flanked by two Falmer bridges leading through a massive waterfall. There is likely to be a Falmer in the tent, and once the &lt;a href=\"Last%20Dragonborn\"&gt;Dragonborn&lt;/a&gt; moves to the bridges, two Falmer appear, one on each bridge. Both of these bridges lead to the same place.\nThe path splits in two directions. To the south is a room with a trapped entrance containing a couple of Falmer buildings (one of which contains an &lt;a href=\"Alchemy%20Station\"&gt;Alchemy Station&lt;/a&gt;), a trapped chest, and a few Chaurus Hunter cocoons, whilst to the north is a tunnel down which is a rock-fall trap and some bone chimes. Further down the tunnel is a ramp along one wall, and besides this ramp is a skeleton with a satchel containing random potions and alchemical ingredients. Following the tunnel on, one will soon come across a skeleton holding \"&lt;a href=\"Darkfall%20Passage%20Note%20II\"&gt;Darkfall Passage Note II&lt;/a&gt;\", besides which lies a leveled potion and shield. Beyond are two rope pulls, the left-hand one is the correct one, which opens a hidden door to a Vale Sabre Cat perched on a rock. The tunnel opens up into a massive cave, a rocky path on the northern side leads down to the cave floor. The path crosses a few rock bridges over the huge pool, to the south, after which another Vale Sabre Cat can be found. Dispatching this creature, another rock bridge heads upwards, to the north, then west, and ends at the wayshrine, besides which stands the ghost of &lt;a href=\"Prelate%20Sidanyis\"&gt;Prelate Sidanyis&lt;/a&gt;, the wayshrine leads to the &lt;a href=\"Forgotten%20Vale\"&gt;Forgotten Vale&lt;/a&gt;."}

As the Sepulcher is entered, the ghost of &lt;a href=\"Gallus%20Desidenius\"&gt;Gallus Desidenius&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"Nightingale\"&gt;Nightingale&lt;/a&gt; murdered by &lt;a href=\"Mercer%20Frey\"&gt;Mercer Frey&lt;/a&gt;, is encountered. He warns the Dragonborn that, because the &lt;a href=\"Keys%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Key&lt;/a&gt; is missing, the other ghosts have been corrupted and are now hostile. When asked about the obstacles to reaching the Ebonmere Lock, he advises to look for a journal that belonged to another adventurer, &lt;a href=\"Nystrom\"&gt;Nystrom&lt;/a&gt;. His skeleton is to the east of Gallus.\nNystrom's journal holds some clues to the trials:\n\"Shadows of their former selves, sentinels of the dark. They wander ever more and deal swift death to defilers.\"\n\"Above all they stand, vigilance everlasting. Beholden the murk yet contentious of the glow.\"\n\"Offer what She desires most, but reject the material. For her greatest want is that which cannot be seen, felt or carried.\"\n\"Direct and yet indirect. The path to salvation a route of cunning with fortune betraying the foolish.\"\n\"The journey is complete, the Empress's embrace awaits the fallen. Hesitate not if you wish to gift her your eternal devotion.\"\nNystrom also says that the man who gave him the clues mumbled nonsensical phrases like \"night is the new day\" and how he was the \"ghost of the sun.\"\nFirst trial - Sentinels.\n\"Shadows of their former selves, sentinels of the dark. They wander ever more and deal swift death to defilers.\"\nThe first trial is facing the shadows of their former selves, sentinels of the dark - Nightingale ghosts, hostile and powerful. Either &lt;a href=\"Sneak%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;sneak&lt;/a&gt; past or kill them. If they are killed, there is valuable loot on both sides of this area.\nWhen entering the first trials room, it is relatively easy to sneak attack the Nightingale Sentinel with a bow as they are directly in front of the Dragonborn when they enter. Then they can continue on to the next trial or, in the chance of receiving more loot, kill the other sentinels.\nIn the room on the left, with the &lt;a href=\"Alchemy%20Lab%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;alchemy lab&lt;/a&gt;, there is a desk. A button located under the desk and to the left of the chair opens a secret door in the same room revealing moderate loot.\nSecond trial - Light versus dark.\n\"Above all they stand, vigilance everlasting. Beholden the murk yet contentious of the glow.\"\nFor the second trial, night is the new day: avoid the light and stay on the darkest path. One can enter &lt;a href=\"Sneak%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;sneak&lt;/a&gt; and go through the mist. Standing or moving through the lit areas will cause large amounts of damage, which not even &lt;a href=\"Become%20Ethereal\"&gt;Become Ethereal&lt;/a&gt; can avert, since the damage is scripted to be taken without any magic effect. Watch for trip wires when going up the staircases. During this trial there are no enemies. Candlelight and Magelight spells can also help if having trouble finding the way around, as their own lights are not harmful in this area.\nThird trial - Hidden door.\n\"Offer what She desires most, but reject the material. For her greatest want is that which cannot be seen, felt or carried.\"\nFor the third trial, in the room with the statue and a dead bandit lying in front of it, there are two large sconces to either side of the statue. To the left of the left hand sconce there is a chain, and at the right hand side of the right sconce there is a second chain. Pull the two chains to put out the lights of the sconces, so giving her (Nocturnal) what she desires most (darkness). The door behind the statue will then open.\nFourth trial - Sentinels versus traps.\n\"Direct and yet indirect. The path to salvation a route of cunning with fortune betraying the foolish.\"\nFor the fourth trial, there are some options:\nAfter looting the entire area, proceed north to Twilight Sepulcher - Inner Sanctum. Very soon, there is a point of no return; be sure you have looted everything you want before proceeding.\nFifth trial - The inner sanctum.\n\"The journey is complete, the Empress's embrace awaits the fallen. Hesitate not if you wish to gift her your eternal devotion.\"\nAs you proceed through the Twilight Sepulcher - Inner Sanctum, you will come to a steep pit. This is the point of no return; when you are done here, the first part of the Twilight Sepulcher will be sealed. Fall into the pit and search Anders' skeleton; read the message. Wait a few seconds until the Skeleton Key reacts. The ground will disappear and you will fall. When you land, place the Skeleton Key into the Ebonmere Lock. That will summon Nocturnal, who will bid the Dragonborn to drink from the Ebonmere, \"for this is where the Agent of Nocturnal is born.\"\n\"\"My, my. What do we have here? It's been a number of years since I've set foot on your world. Or perhaps it's been moments. One tends to lose track. So... once again the Key has been stolen and a \"champion\" returns it to the Sepulcher. Now that Ebonmere has been restored, you stand before me awaiting your accolades; a pat on your head... a kiss on your cheek. What you fail to realize is your actions were expected and represent nothing more than the fulfillment of your agreement. Don't mistake my tone for displeasure, after all, you've obediently performed your duties to the letter. But we both know this has little to do with honor and oaths and loyalty. It's about the reward; the prize. Fear not. You'll have your trinkets, your desire for power, your hunger for wealth. I bid you to drink deeply from the Ebonmere, mortal. For this is where the Agent of Nocturnal is born. The Oath has been struck, the die has been cast and your fate awaits you in the Evergloam. Farewell, Nightingale. See to it the Key stays this time, won't you?\"\"\nThen speak to Karliah, and she explains the choice that must be made between the Agent of &lt;a href=\"Nightingale%20Strife\"&gt;Strife&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Nightingale%20Subterfuge\"&gt;Subterfuge&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Shadowcloak%20of%20Nocturnal\"&gt;Stealth&lt;/a&gt;. To pick one, step on the corresponding moon. They give greater Powers, usable once a day only. The Dragonborn can later choose to change the chosen power after a day so there is little pressure in choosing the best ability. Next, talk to Karliah. After Karliah is spoken to, Gallus' ghost will appear and they will speak shortly before he goes to &lt;a href=\"Evergloam\"&gt;Evergloam&lt;/a&gt;. Karliah then goes back to &lt;a href=\"Nightingale%20Hall\"&gt;Nightingale Hall&lt;/a&gt;. The Dragonborn can then leave through the southern portal.\nPowers.\n&lt;a href=\"Shadowcloak%20of%20Nocturnal\"&gt;Nightingale of Shadows&lt;/a&gt;\n&lt;a href=\"Nightingale%20Subterfuge\"&gt;Nightingale Subterfuge&lt;/a&gt;\n&lt;a href=\"Nightingale%20Strife\"&gt;Nightingale Strife&lt;/a&gt;"}

The town is known for mining &lt;a href=\"Corundum%20Ore\"&gt;Corundum Ore&lt;/a&gt; in the area.\nDescription.\nGeography.\nDarkwater Crossing is a significantly small settlement situated along the road near &lt;a href=\"Darkwater%20River\"&gt;Darkwater River&lt;/a&gt;. The village is located on the edge of the Eastmarch Sulfur Pools which take up a large portion of the region. The settlement was recently founded when a large deposit of &lt;a href=\"Corundum%20Ore\"&gt;Corundum Ore&lt;/a&gt; was found on a small escarpment next to the Darkwater River Basin. The closest locations to Darkwater Crossing are &lt;a href=\"Fort%20Amol\"&gt;Fort Amol&lt;/a&gt; to the west and &lt;a href=\"Mistwatch\"&gt;Mistwatch&lt;/a&gt; to the east.\nHistory.\n&lt;a href=\"Second%20Era\"&gt;Second Era&lt;/a&gt;.\nDuring the &lt;a href=\"Interregnum\"&gt;Interregnum&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"2E%20582\"&gt;2E 582&lt;/a&gt;, the town of Darkwater Crossing was inhabited by &lt;a href=\"Argonian\"&gt;Argonian&lt;/a&gt; migrants that had arrived from &lt;a href=\"Stonefalls\"&gt;Stonefalls&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Morrowind\"&gt;Morrowind&lt;/a&gt;, seeking work at &lt;a href=\"Fort%20Amol\"&gt;Fort Amol&lt;/a&gt;. But due to subsequent overpopulation, the settlers moved eastward and founded the town of Darkwater Crossing. One of the Argonians, &lt;a href=\"Stormy-Eyes\"&gt;Stormy-Eyes&lt;/a&gt; was an accomplished healer and a &lt;a href=\"Dreamwalker%20%28Lore%29\"&gt;Dreamwalker&lt;/a&gt;, a priest of &lt;a href=\"Vaermina\"&gt;Vaermina&lt;/a&gt; that can walk into people's dreams. Around the same time, the leaders of the &lt;a href=\"Ebonheart%20Pact\"&gt;Ebonheart Pact&lt;/a&gt; gathered at Fort Amol to discuss the condition of the alliance. &lt;a href=\"Jorunn%20the%20Skald-King\"&gt;Jorunn the Skald-King&lt;/a&gt; was poisoned by a &lt;a href=\"Daedric\"&gt;Daedric&lt;/a&gt; concoction used by the &lt;a href=\"Stormfist%20Brigade\"&gt;Stormfist Brigade&lt;/a&gt;, a militia owned by Jorunn's brother, &lt;a href=\"Fildgor%20Orcthane\"&gt;Fildgor Orcthane&lt;/a&gt;. The Ebonheart Pact required the help of Stormy-Eyes and the &lt;a href=\"Ternion%20Monks\"&gt;Ternion Monks&lt;/a&gt; from &lt;a href=\"Mistwatch\"&gt;Mistwatch&lt;/a&gt;. A traveler called the &lt;a href=\"Vestige\"&gt;Vestige&lt;/a&gt; aided the Argonians of Darkwater to have Stormy-Eyes help the King.\nA &lt;a href=\"Redguard\"&gt;Redguard&lt;/a&gt; named &lt;a href=\"Asmalah%20the%20Caller\"&gt;Asmalah the Caller&lt;/a&gt; traveled to Darkwater to have Stormy-Eyes help his dying wife. The resulting procedure ended with her death, and it made Asmalah vengeful towards the Argonians. He covered the town in blood, causing the local &lt;a href=\"Troll\"&gt;Troll&lt;/a&gt;s to ransack the town. The Argonians fled to a nearby cave. The Vestige defeated the Troll Leader and brought peace in Darkwater by bringing Asmalah to his senses. Stormy-Eyes later traveled to Mistwatch to help Jorunn overcome the poison.\n&lt;a href=\"Fourth%20Era\"&gt;Fourth Era&lt;/a&gt;.\nFor some time, Darkwater Crossing was abandoned and had no use up until &lt;a href=\"4E%20201\"&gt;4E 201&lt;/a&gt;, when a &lt;a href=\"Nord\"&gt;Nord&lt;/a&gt;ic explorer named &lt;a href=\"Annekke%20Crag-Jumper\"&gt;Annekke Crag-Jumper&lt;/a&gt; discovered a vein of &lt;a href=\"Corundum%20Ore\"&gt;Corundum Ore&lt;/a&gt; on the hillside and built a cabin there. Word spread in &lt;a href=\"Eastmarch\"&gt;Eastmarch&lt;/a&gt; and more people arrived at her home and set up camp. Darkwater Crossing was founded at that point and became property of the city of &lt;a href=\"Windhelm\"&gt;Windhelm&lt;/a&gt;. This same year, &lt;a href=\"Ulfric%20Stormcloak%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Ulfric Stormcloak&lt;/a&gt; along with a contingent of Stormcloaks were ambushed at Darkwater Crossing and sent to &lt;a href=\"Helgen\"&gt;Helgen&lt;/a&gt; for execution."}
