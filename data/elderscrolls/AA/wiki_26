They are deemed to be trivial and inconsequential in the greater scheme of things, a subject unsuited to &lt;a href=\"Psijic%20Order%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Psijic&lt;/a&gt; study when there is still so much we don't understand about our immediate &lt;a href=\"Aurbic\"&gt;Aurbic&lt;/a&gt; surroundings. But it seems to this poor scholar that \"the greater scheme of things\" is a broad tapestry woven of threads uncounted, and in the warp and weft of reality who is to say with certainty what is consequential and what is trivial? I believe no subject is unsuited to Psijic study, as all things are bound together. The power of knowledge is infinite: the power of ignorance can shatter &lt;a href=\"Ebony\"&gt;Ebony&lt;/a&gt; like &lt;a href=\"glass\"&gt;glass&lt;/a&gt;.\nPerhaps you find that an unnecessary and rather pompous preamble, but withhold judgment on that, because by the time this course is complete, I believe you will agree it is accurate. To illustrate the average Psijic's ignorance of these matters, I will commence with a lecture about the little-known plane of Detritus and its enigmatic Daedra Lord Hha-Lugh-Zhek, which you have probably heard spoken in common parlance as &lt;a href=\"Hollowjack\"&gt;Hollowjack&lt;/a&gt;. Though many regard Lord Hollowjack as a fictional bogey invoked during the &lt;a href=\"Witches%20Festival\"&gt;Witches Festival&lt;/a&gt; to frighten superstitious peasants, he is all too real, and tales of him appearing in cemeteries under the Harvest Moons to terrify the unwary have a basis in objective fact.\nLet me introduce you to the reality behind the legends: Hollowjack is a unique Greater Daedra who bears the title Lord of Mortal Fears, and takes as his province the placatory worship of all &lt;a href=\"Men\"&gt;Men&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Mer\"&gt;Mer&lt;/a&gt; who are driven by fear to pray for divine intervention. According to Hollowjack, such worshipers belong to him, in heart if not in soul, and he derives supernatural power by feeding on their terror. The metaphysical mechanism of this \"fear feeding\" is a mystery, as it doesn't fall into any of the mystical categories of &lt;a href=\"the%20Old%20Ways\"&gt;the Old Ways&lt;/a&gt; as we Psijics understand them. But just as we can't deny the existence of Flame spells just because we don't study &lt;a href=\"Destruction%20Staff%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Destruction&lt;/a&gt; magic, we can't discount Daedric fear feeding just because we can't explain it\u2014there are too many verified accounts that attest to it.\nNow, I said, \"According to Hollowjack,\" as if we had the Daedra Lord's personal testimony or interviews to draw upon, but such is not the case: Hollowjack is an elusive fellow who appears to mortals only long enough to make their most dreaded fears come true. However, there are many folk tales of the fearful being driven mad by their fears in the form of repeated visitations by Lord Hollowjack, a class I refer to as \"Hollowjack's Haunted,\" who provide us with a long (though fragmentary) literary tradition of personal accounts of the Fear Daedra, and we can draw upon these for glimpses of their persecutor. Consider this excerpt from the archived journal in our library filed as \"Haunting #427\":\n\"Sometimes Petra has multi-day shifts where she has to spend several nights deep in the mine, and then He comes and to tell me softly that the ceiling will collapse, as it did on me, and Petra will never return. He steeples his long, long fingers as he speaks, talons tapping against one another, tip-tip-tap, except when he points at my eye for emphasis.\"\nAnother excerpt, from Haunting #112:\n\"\u2026his teeth oh &lt;a href=\"mara\"&gt;mara&lt;/a&gt; his teeth how can HE have so many so long so sharp no one should ever smile because HE smiles and when he does oh mara preserve me\u2026.\"\nAnd finally, this one from Haunting #4:\n\"He told me then of his realm, &lt;a href=\"Detritus\"&gt;Detritus&lt;/a&gt;, and how he frivols there among his collection of shattered memories, categorizing and classing them as this or that, replaying them from different angles to find new vulnerabilities in the mortal mind, new chinks in the armor of strength and sanity that protect us from succumbing to fear. There is no outside on Detritus, he said, only inside, only room after room of recurring nightmares and internal torments. 'For mortals fear most what is inside themselves,' he whispered. 'And most of the time I need only remind them of who they really are within. That's enough, and more than enough.'\"\nThis gives a sample, but if you spend some time in the library this session to read the Hauntings yourself, you'll find that they're remarkably consistent in their descriptions of Lord Hollowjack: he speaks softly or in whispers from a mouth full of long, sharp teeth, and he has long, slender, and agile fingers tipped with sharp nails, \"talons\" that can slash or puncture, but most often just gently emphasize what the voice behind them is saying. Accounts of his Oblivion realm are also consistent, describing a claustrophobic series of small spaces cluttered and jammed with piles of mortals' lost and broken personal items.\nSo, when the Witches Festival comes 'round again, and you hear merchants and mountebanks jesting about Lord Hollowjack, and frightening children by waving long fingers in their faces, think about the truth behind the jokes. Have some compassion for the terrified, and try to believe the stories they tell. Most importantly, when it's night and you're afraid, make no desperate prayers for succor. You might not like how they're answered."}

He sponsored &lt;a href=\"Chef%20Toel\"&gt;Chef Toel&lt;/a&gt;'s kitchen.\nPhysical appearance.\nIrrel was somewhat translucent, like the other lords of Umbriel. Flashes of skull showed through his fine, long features. His large eyes glowed with a soft purple light that shone through his lids when he closed them. He was a head taller than other &lt;a href=\"Umbrielians\"&gt;Umbrielians&lt;/a&gt;.\nLord Irrel wore finer clothes than ordinary Umbrielians. His robe seemed to be made of black smoke within which winked thousands of tiny sparks.

When Toel incorporated &lt;a href=\"Anna%C3%AFg\"&gt;Anna\u00efg&lt;/a&gt; to his kitchen, Lord Irrel sent his compliments more often. Lord Irrel\u2019s tastes tended toward the inane. No meal of less than thirty\ncourses ever pleased him. Preparing fifty or more courses was the safest bet. Almost everything he ate involved processing the stolen souls that were collected by &lt;a href=\"Umbriel\"&gt;Umbriel&lt;/a&gt;. He only ate one meal a day, followed by tree-wine vats.\nAfter Toel's death, Lord Irrel went to his kitchen to inquire his undercheft whether they could still win &lt;a href=\"Lord%20Rhel\"&gt;Lord Rhel&lt;/a&gt;'s tasting. He asked who was Toel's second, and &lt;a href=\"Intovar\"&gt;Intovar&lt;/a&gt; stepped forward. Lord Irrel was not pleased by Intovar's answer, so he flicked something from his finger and Intovar dropped to his knees ending with his life. &lt;a href=\"Yeum\"&gt;Yeum&lt;/a&gt;, who was the only underchef left told Irrel that they did not stand a chance to win the taste without Toel. However, Anna\u00efg dared to speak to Lord Irrel, and she told him that they could win the contest. Lord Irrel trusted Anna\u00efg, and he let her in charge of the kitchen.\nAnna\u00efg ended up winning the tasting, and she was promoted to chef by &lt;a href=\"Lord%20Rhel\"&gt;Lord Rhel&lt;/a&gt;, ending her job at Lord Irrel's kitchen."}

I don't know. Perhaps I should tell the others. But what hope would they have then? I will have to tell &lt;a href=\"Lord%20Kelvyn\"&gt;Kelvyn&lt;/a&gt;, one day, when it is time for him to assume the lordship of the Castle. He, at least, may forgive me, as I am his father.\nI must collect my thoughts. Lord Kain returned last night, while the others were gone to the city. Thank &lt;a href=\"Onsi\"&gt;Onsi&lt;/a&gt; it was only myself and Garridan -- faithful friend! I have sworn him to secrecy. He was only too happy to let me take responsibility for what we did.\nLater: I am more resolved than ever that the others must never find out. They must never know what Lord &lt;a href=\"Kain\"&gt;Kain&lt;/a&gt; has become, our liege lord -- we sacrificed everything for him!\nI will set it all down here, clearly, so that others may judge whether I have done right or wrong.\nWhen Garridan woke me to tell me that Lord Kain had arrived, I was overjoyed at first. Garridan's grim face soon warned me that all was not well, but he would not tell me what was wrong. Only that Lord Kain was accompanied by &lt;a href=\"Arielle%20Jurard%20%28Lich%29\"&gt;Arielle Jurard&lt;/a&gt;, a name to freeze the blood -- a &lt;a href=\"Bretons%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;Breton&lt;/a&gt; battlemage of sinister reputation in &lt;a href=\"Lainlyn\"&gt;Lainlyn&lt;/a&gt;.\nLord Kain was waiting in the great hall with Arielle Jurard. He was heavily cloaked, unsurprisingly as it was a foul night, but I wondered why he had not removed it upon entering the castle.\nI greeted Lord Kain warmly, ignoring his companion for the moment, but when he spoke, it was only haltingly, and with a grating edge that I had never heard before. \"Where are the others?\" was all he said. Arielle Jurard quickly intervened, explaining that Lord Kain was unwell and needed a place to rest.\nBy the time Kain was abed, I was fully alarmed. He moved like an old man, and barely spoke in my presence. He left a foul odor in his wake, and remained cloaked until I left him in my chambers. I then demanded that Arielle explain herself, which she was only too willing to do. Her story was appalling. Apparently Kain had perished in battle shortly after we left, but by her &lt;a href=\"Necromancy\"&gt;arts&lt;/a&gt; she had returned him to life, and now planned to gather an army of Knights to resume the war against &lt;a href=\"Shrike\"&gt;Baron Shrike&lt;/a&gt;. Her eyes glittered with pride as she told me all this -- she is so far gone in madness and evil that she actually believed that I would go along with her plan to install a necromatic puppet on the throne of Lainlyn! For all Baron Shrike's cruelties, he at least is mortal and will one day pass on the rule to an heir.\nSomehow I was able to hide my shock from Arielle Jurard, and pretended to agree to her plan. \"The other knights will need to have Lord Kain's... condition... explained to them before they see him,\" I told her. \"Otherwise the surprise of seeing him may lead some to regrettable actions.\" Thinking quickly, I suggested that she tend to Lord Kain in the grotto until I had prepared the others. She agreed without suspicion -- I wonder if her mind has become disordered by her evil practices -- my performance could not have been all that convincing.\nOnce they were inside, I shut them in, with Garridan's help. May &lt;a href=\"Tu%27whacca\"&gt;Tu'whacca&lt;/a&gt; have mercy on Lord Kain's soul... As for Arielle Jurard, I wish nothing but endless night on her foul spirit.\nI've had workmen cover up the doorway. Only a few of the others were ever aware of that passage behind the training room -- luckily Kelvyn was not among them. I'll have to come up with some story to satisfy those who ask about the grotto -- or tell them the truth and face the consequences."}

I resort to such measures out of desperation. I pen this while &lt;a href=\"Battlehorn%20Castle\"&gt;Battlehorn Castle&lt;/a&gt; lies besieged by a band of ruthless marauders, with little hope that any of us will survive. \"Besieged\" I say, although this petty battle would not have even rated a footnote in the great days of the Knights of the True Horn. We have fallen on hard times, indeed.\nI will entrust this document to my last faithful retainers, with instructions to destroy it in the last extremity, although I accept that I may have provided the means for my murderers to legally take the lordship of Battlehorn Castle. So be it.\nTo the new lord of Battlehorn Castle, whoever you are, know that you inherit a stronghold with a proud tradition. Battlehorn Castle was built by a remnant of the Knights of the True Horn who were exiled from our homeland of &lt;a href=\"Lainlyn\"&gt;Lainlyn&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Hammerfell\"&gt;Hammerfell&lt;/a&gt;. After a failed battle to dethrone Baron &lt;a href=\"Shrike\"&gt;Shrike&lt;/a&gt; of Lainlyn, our leader, Lord Kain, ordered us to split up into as many small groups as possible until the time should come that he would recall us. My father was part of a group that settled here in &lt;a href=\"Cyrodiil\"&gt;Cyrodiil&lt;/a&gt; and built Battlehorn Castle as a refuge while they waited for Lord &lt;a href=\"Kain\"&gt;Kain&lt;/a&gt;'s message... a message that never arrived.\nOver the years, all the Knights of our little band either gave up or passed on, all but one: my father Jaren. Since his untimely death, I have continued to hold Battlehorn Castle in the hope that someday we will hear from Lord Kain and our great exile will be at an end.\nI am afraid that the fortunes of Battlehorn Castle have fallen on hard times. What resources I had available I devoted to maintaining the castle itself -- its walls still stand strong and its hearths still provide warmth. Sadly, this came at great cost, and many of the items within its walls had to be sold in order to meet the enormous payments such maintenance begets. If you find yourself with the means to restore &lt;a href=\"Battlehorn%20Castle\"&gt;Battlehorn Castle&lt;/a&gt; to its former glory, a friend of my father's named &lt;a href=\"Nilphas%20Omellian\"&gt;Nilphas Omellian&lt;/a&gt; still holds many of the castle in storage and on account. All that is required is to repay the Castle's debts to Nilphas, and I'm certain he'll happily return the items.\nMy final request for the new lord of Battlehorn Castle is to continue to uphold the proud traditions of the Knights of the True Horn, and to honor the memory of our brave service."}

Shortly after, his army conquered &lt;a href=\"Leyawiin\"&gt;Leyawiin&lt;/a&gt; and was already besieging &lt;a href=\"Bravil\"&gt;Bravil&lt;/a&gt;.\nBy the end of &lt;a href=\"4E%20172\"&gt;4E 172&lt;/a&gt;, Lord Naarifin's army had advanced to the walls of the &lt;a href=\"Imperial%20City\"&gt;Imperial City&lt;/a&gt;, while there were clashes between the &lt;a href=\"Aldmeri%20Navy\"&gt;Aldmeri Navy&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Imperial%20Navy\"&gt;Imperial Navy&lt;/a&gt; on &lt;a href=\"Lake%20Rumare\"&gt;Lake Rumare&lt;/a&gt;.

Shortly after this, Lord Naarifin would begin working on a dread prophecy to bring about a Dominion victory, &lt;a href=\"The%20Culling\"&gt;The Culling&lt;/a&gt;. The Battle of the Red Ring, however, changed the course of action, Naarifin had almost completed the prophecy, but was defeated just in time by the &lt;a href=\"The%20Forgotten%20Hero\"&gt;Forgotten Hero&lt;/a&gt; to prevent the Culling from being completed. Following his defeat, Naarifin was kept alive for thirty-three days, hanging from the White-Gold Tower. It is rumored that a flying &lt;a href=\"Daedra\"&gt;Daedra&lt;/a&gt; took his body away on the thirty-fourth day."}

In life, he was an &lt;a href=\"Imperials%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Imperial&lt;/a&gt; Lord who had partial rulership of &lt;a href=\"Kvatch%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Kvatch&lt;/a&gt; during the &lt;a href=\"Alessian%20Doctrines\"&gt;Alessian Doctrines&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;a href=\"First%20Era\"&gt;First Era&lt;/a&gt;.

His secret was discovered decades later, and in revenge cast a spell that obliterated the Alessian Army at his gate, along with his fort. He then buried his children on the surface and retreated to the ground, sealing the entrance behind him.\nInteractions.\n&lt;a href=\"Looming%20Shadows\"&gt;Looming Shadows&lt;/a&gt;.\nLord Faleria is seen roaming the inner ruins of Tribune's Folly, in what remains of his fort. After you come close enough to him, he will fade and summon his shadow minions, then later the corrupted &lt;a href=\"Minotaur%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Minotaur&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Limenauruus\"&gt;Limenauruus&lt;/a&gt;. He is guarding the \"First Era Personal Relic\".\nHistory.\nEarly life.\nIn the wake of the &lt;a href=\"Alessian%20Doctrines\"&gt;Alessian Doctrines&lt;/a&gt;, Nunex Faleria ruled as a Lord of the &lt;a href=\"Kvatch\"&gt;Kvatch&lt;/a&gt; Regency Council, made up of a king and two other lords.\nAs a young man, to the shame of his family, Nunex Faleria fell in love with an &lt;a href=\"Mer\"&gt;Elven&lt;/a&gt; scholar who was well versed in the ways of dark magic and &lt;a href=\"necromancy\"&gt;necromancy&lt;/a&gt;. Seeing the xenophobia towards the &lt;a href=\"Nenalata\"&gt;Nenalata&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Ayleid\"&gt;Ayleid&lt;/a&gt;s who, despite swearing fealty to the &lt;a href=\"Alessian%20Empire\"&gt;Alessian Empire&lt;/a&gt;, remained unwelcome by the &lt;a href=\"Alessian%20Order\"&gt;Alessian Order&lt;/a&gt; supporting society, Faleria and &lt;a href=\"Lady%20Faleria\"&gt;his wife&lt;/a&gt; decided to marry in secret. Poring over lost secrets, they hoped to find a way to be together for eternity.\nHiding from the Empire.\nThey enjoyed a few short years of happiness, but this ended with the decree of the &lt;a href=\"First%20Pogrom\"&gt;First Pogrom&lt;/a&gt; between &lt;a href=\"1E%20372\"&gt;1E 372&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"1E%20374\"&gt;374&lt;/a&gt;. In order to hide his wife from the slaughter of the Ayleid people across &lt;a href=\"Cyrod\"&gt;Cyrod&lt;/a&gt;, Lord Faleria expanded his complex, &lt;a href=\"Fort%20Faleria\"&gt;Fort Faleria&lt;/a&gt;, into many underground tunnels beneath the structure. To enlarge it, they used magic, hired workers, and a tribe of &lt;a href=\"Minotaur%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Minotaur&lt;/a&gt;s. It was to be a grand underground complex to match the structures of his wife's Ayleid ancestors.\nOnce each wing was completed, they secretly had the workers put to death, not wanting to have secrets and rumors spread. Some were buried, while others had their lifeforce drawn out of them to extend Faleria and wife's lifespan. Some were also raised as undead guardians, guarding the fort.\nAs the complex grew, Faleria and his wife had half-breed children with strong Elvish traits, whom he swore to protect from the Empire, who would execute or banish them, at any cost. His first child, a daughter named &lt;a href=\"Lucina%20Faleria\"&gt;Lucina Faleria&lt;/a&gt;, was born in &lt;a href=\"1E%20374\"&gt;1E 374&lt;/a&gt;. Their first son, &lt;a href=\"Neransi%20Faleria\"&gt;Neransi&lt;/a&gt;, was born in &lt;a href=\"1E%20383\"&gt;1E 383&lt;/a&gt;. His final child, a son named &lt;a href=\"Ianus%20Faleria\"&gt;Ianus Faleria&lt;/a&gt;, was born in &lt;a href=\"1E%20386\"&gt;1E 386&lt;/a&gt;. Lady Faleria died during the childbirth of Ianus. In mourning, Lord Faleria built a great brass tomb in the tunnels, sealing Lady Faleria in it and vowing to protect their children from the religious zealots of the Empire.\nLord Faleria edged closer and closer to madness after the death of his wife, and could not express his concerns to his peers in the outside world. It was at this time that he delved deeper into the dark arts, formulating magic that was fueled by darkness from a far realm. It was so powerful that it had the ability to consume all things good and light, and he learned to channel it without need for limit.\nIn order to keep his Elven family a secret, he used disposable labor to further expand the fortress and give his children new comforts. As the children grew into adults, they had still rarely seen sunlight, and his youngest son, Ianus, could not bear his confinement any longer. He learned an easy method of escape, and did so often in order to see the outside world.\nIanus soon fell in love with a merchant's daughter. The girl was soon with Ianus' child, who was born in &lt;a href=\"1E%20420\"&gt;1E 420&lt;/a&gt; as &lt;a href=\"Maxivian%20Faleria\"&gt;Maxivian Faleria&lt;/a&gt;. Her parents were horrified to discover the child's elvish traits and subsequently forced her to confess that her lover was Lord Faleria's son, Ianus. In order to keep his family from being discovered, he took his grandson Maxivian and hid him with the rest of the family.\nIt was only a matter of days before the Alessian Empire arrived at the gate Fort Faleria, charging with crimes ranging from treason to giving aid to the enemy. Lord Faleria had no defense to argue against this but he had prepared a deadly ritual for this day, for if he could not be with his family he would destroy the Imperial Army along with everything he had created.\nDuring the night of 19th &lt;a href=\"Sun%27s%20Dawn\"&gt;Sun's Dawn&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"1E%20421\"&gt;1E 421&lt;/a&gt;,Lord Faleria concluded the ritual in his madness. At the final moment of the ritual, his son's hand fell upon Faleria's shoulder. He was standing with the rest of the family behind him.\nIt was too late to cancel the ritual. Dark shadows crawled up like smoke from the ground, dissolving walls, objects, and even people. Some formed human-like shapes and began attacking the army from within. Others opened up like rifts, and the world fell inside them. When it was over, only Lord Faleria remained among the ruins of his fort.\nHe buried his three children and his grandchild on the surface, where he never allowed them to go. He then retreated into a hole in the ground, sealing it behind him. The site of the ruins became known as &lt;a href=\"Tribune%27s%20Folly\"&gt;Tribune's Folly&lt;/a&gt;, with Fort Faleria thought to have been lost forever.\nLegacy.\nLord Faleria is remembered by his name, for the ruins of his ruins were lost for centuries. Faleria still desired to be forgotten by history, and only wished to keep the memories of his family. In &lt;a href=\"1E%20478\"&gt;1E 478&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Rislav%20Larich\"&gt;Rislav Larich&lt;/a&gt; became the King of &lt;a href=\"Kvatch\"&gt;Kvatch&lt;/a&gt; and pushed out the Alessian Empire that invaded Fort Faleria. Tribune's Folly, the remains of Fort Faleria, was merely a hole bellowing smoke from the ground. The origin of its name was lost to history.\nIn &lt;a href=\"2E%20582\"&gt;2E 582&lt;/a&gt;, a digging expedition was commissioned at the site of Tribune's Folly, but the workers were forced out after Faleria's shadow warriors attacked them. The &lt;a href=\"Vestige\"&gt;Vestige&lt;/a&gt; was later sent to retrieve a personal relic of Faleria and clear out Faleria's shadow warriors. Once this was completed, the digging expedition was planned to be re-opened. By &lt;a href=\"3E%20433\"&gt;3E 433&lt;/a&gt;, nothing visible remained of Tribune's Folly either.\nCombat.\nLord Faleria does not fight you himself, though he sends a number of &lt;a href=\"Shadow%20Archer\"&gt;Archers&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Shadow%20Assassin\"&gt;Assassins&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Shadow%20Bat\"&gt;Bats&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Shadow%20Bloodfiend\"&gt;Bloodfiends&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Shadow%20Shadecaller\"&gt;Shadecallers&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Shadow%20Wraith\"&gt;Wraiths&lt;/a&gt; to attack you once you enter his fort. After they are defeated, he will summon &lt;a href=\"Limenauruus\"&gt;Limenauruus&lt;/a&gt;, a corrupted and extremely powerful &lt;a href=\"Minotaur%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Minotaur&lt;/a&gt; to kill you. While fighting Limenauruus, a number of shadow minions will also spawn to aid him."}

Anna\u00efg also knew that he prided himself on a sort of coarseness of taste, probably imitating Lord Umbriel, who was known to dine on the lowest sorts of matter at times.

Lord Rhel informed Anna\u00efg that she had won the contest, and that she would prepare a meal for Lord Umbriel.\nAfter Anna\u00efg poisoned Glim, Lord Rhel showed her Glim's body to identify him.

He is the mentor of &lt;a href=\"Commander%20Reliana\"&gt;Commander Reliana&lt;/a&gt;, another Knight of the Dragon.\nHistory.\nEarly life.\nTrystan lived around the &lt;a href=\"Timeline%2310th%20Century\"&gt;10th century of the First Era&lt;/a&gt;, during the Classical Period. When he was young, he was but a squire with little coin dining at a tavern. In walked the Blademaster Gaiden Shinji, wearing tattered robes and no gold to his name. Though Trystan didn't know who he was, he offered to share his meal with the starving stranger in exchange for a duel.\nTrystan and Shinji practiced fighting, with Shinji winning each time, and every duel lasting around a mere three seconds. The Blademaster calmly explained how he had defeated him, and urged Trystan to try again. Later, they ate and talked, and Shinji left without telling Trystan his name.\nYears later, Shinji spoke highly of Trystan during his promotion to becoming a Knight of the Dragon, surprising him the most out of everyone in the audience.\n&lt;a href=\"Siege%20of%20Orsinium\"&gt;Siege of Orsinium&lt;/a&gt;.\nTrystan led the Knights of the Dragon during the Siege of Orsinium in support of &lt;a href=\"Joile\"&gt;Joile&lt;/a&gt;. Joile later appointed &lt;a href=\"General%20Mercedene\"&gt;General Mercedene&lt;/a&gt; as the commander of Joile's forces during the siege. At a camp of the &lt;a href=\"Order%20of%20Diagna\"&gt;Order of Diagna&lt;/a&gt;, Shinji requested that Trystan tell Joile to call off the siege. Trystan explained that he could not change Joile's decision, and told him the king had requested for Shinji and &lt;a href=\"Baloth%20Bloodtusk\"&gt;Baloth Bloodtusk&lt;/a&gt; to duel in order to end the siege, to which Shinji agreed.\nDuring the duel, &lt;a href=\"Joile%27s%20Archer\"&gt;Joile's Archer&lt;/a&gt;s shot both Shinji and Baloth, taking out Orsinium and &lt;a href=\"Hammerfell\"&gt;Hammerfell&lt;/a&gt;'s greatest warriors for his future invasion plan. Joile's betrayal outraged and shocked Trystan, who was injured by Mercedene. He sent his assistant, &lt;a href=\"Commander%20Reliana\"&gt;Commander Reliana&lt;/a&gt;, to kill Mercedene. Trystan later carried out Shinji's wishes of buring him with his final opponent, Baloth, to which Baloth's brother &lt;a href=\"Rokaug\"&gt;Rokaug&lt;/a&gt; agreed to. Trystan expressed that he would withdraw the Knights of the Dragon from involvement in the siege, saying they have no part in the king's treachery.\nInteractions.\n&lt;a href=\"The%20Ashes%20of%20Our%20Fathers\"&gt;The Ashes of Our Fathers&lt;/a&gt;.\nIn &lt;a href=\"Honor%27s%20Rest\"&gt;Honor's Rest&lt;/a&gt;, the burial chamber of one of &lt;a href=\"Gaiden%20Shinji\"&gt;Gaiden Shinji&lt;/a&gt;'s disciples, &lt;a href=\"Tamahl\"&gt;Tamahl&lt;/a&gt;, is found. It contains a Memorial Pool, imbued with his memory of Shinji and Lord Trsytan prior to the duel of Shinji and &lt;a href=\"Baloth%20Bloodtusk\"&gt;Baloth Bloodtusk&lt;/a&gt;. After drinking from the pool, you is transported to the memory as Tamahl. There, you can find Shinji arguing with Trystan.\nAfterwords, you can speak to Lord Trystan about the &lt;a href=\"Siege%20of%20Orsinium\"&gt;Siege of Orsinium&lt;/a&gt;, the background of &lt;a href=\"General%20Mercedene\"&gt;General Mercedene&lt;/a&gt;, and his relation to Shinji.\nLater on, after drinking from a memorial pool in Shinji and Baloth's chamber, you are transported to a memory of &lt;a href=\"Commander%20Reliana\"&gt;Commander Reliana&lt;/a&gt;, Trystan's assistant. It takes place in the &lt;a href=\"Orsinium%23Firat%20Orsinium\"&gt;First Orsinium&lt;/a&gt;, during Shinji and Baloth's duel.\nAfter Shinji and Baloth are shot by &lt;a href=\"Joile%27s%20Archer\"&gt;Joile's Archer&lt;/a&gt;s, Trsytan can be spoken to, and tasks you with killing General Mercedene for her treachery. Once that is done, he can be found speaking to Baloth's brother, &lt;a href=\"Rokaug\"&gt;Rokaug&lt;/a&gt;.\nTrystan can then be spoken to, notifying him of Mercedene's death and Joile's betrayal. And then says that he plans to bury Shinji and Baloth in a tomb, under Shinji's wishes, with Rokaug agreeing. You must then later leave the memory.\nDialogue.\nAs &lt;a href=\"Tamahl\"&gt;Tamahl&lt;/a&gt;.\nAs though you were raised among &lt;a href=\"Redguards%20%28Online%29\"&gt;my people&lt;/a&gt;, Lord Trystan. \"\"Wonderful. I expect we won't be at Orsinium for long. With the Blademaster set to duel &lt;a href=\"Baloth%20Bloodtusk\"&gt;Baloth Bloodtusk&lt;/a&gt;, we can end the siege before &lt;a href=\"General%20Mercedene\"&gt;General Mercedene&lt;/a&gt; turns it into a bloodbath.\"\nWhat can you tell me about General Mercedene? \"\"She is.. an able commander. She leads the &lt;a href=\"Winterborn%20%28Faction%29\"&gt;Winterborn&lt;/a&gt;, the most accomplished of King Joile's mercenary bands hired from &lt;a href=\"the%20Reach\"&gt;the Reach&lt;/a&gt;. As it seems General Mercedene is more devout in her worship of Malacath than the Orcs themselves.\"\nHow do you know Gaiden Shinji? \"Long ago I was a mere squire dining in a tavern. In walked Gaiden Shinji with ragged clothes, a simple blade, and empty pockets. I had very little coin, but I knew he was starving. I offered to share my meal in return for a friendly duel.\"\nAs &lt;a href=\"Commander%20Reliana\"&gt;Commander Reliana&lt;/a&gt;.\n\"General Mercedene killed them both. Dishonored their duel\u2015dishonored their truce.\"\nWhat should I do, my lord? \"My wounds... I cannot face General Mercedene like this. You must confront her in my place. I trust your skill, commander. Quickly! She cannot escape.\"\nConversations.\nIn the first vision:\n&lt;a href=\"Gaiden%20Shinji\"&gt;Gaiden Shinji&lt;/a&gt;: \"\"Your &lt;a href=\"Joile\"&gt;king&lt;/a&gt; should call off &lt;a href=\"Siege%20of%20Orsinium\"&gt;the siege&lt;/a&gt;. The battle is unjust.\"\"\nLord Trystan: \"Shinji... &lt;a href=\"Mercedene\"&gt;Mercedene&lt;/a&gt; now commands &lt;a href=\"Knights%20of%20the%20Dragon%20%28Online%29\"&gt;us&lt;/a&gt;. The siege will not end.\"\nGaiden Shinji: \"\"Mercedene? The Beat of &lt;a href=\"the%20Reach\"&gt;the Reach&lt;/a&gt; is your general?\"\nLord Trystan: \"There's another way. Challenge &lt;a href=\"Baloth%20Bloodtusk\"&gt;Baloth&lt;/a&gt; to a duel. You could end this siege with a swing of your blade.\"\nGaiden Shinji: \"The &lt;a href=\"Orsimer\"&gt;Orcs&lt;/a&gt; will never agree.\"\nLord Trystan: \"The Orcs love Baloth more than &lt;a href=\"Golkarr\"&gt;their own king&lt;/a&gt;. He'll agree\u2015his people have bled enough.\"\"\nGaiden Shinji: \"What would your king say? He appointed Mercedene.\"\nLord Trystan: \"King Joile suggested this. He needs a victory, and won't care who delivers it.\"\nGaiden Shinji: \"\"Then it shall be. The &lt;a href=\"Order%20of%20Diagna\"&gt;Order of Diagna&lt;/a&gt; will march to Orsinium.\"\"\nDuring Gaiden Shinji and Baloth Bloodtusk's duel:\nGeneral Mercedene: \"Archers, now!\"\n&lt;a href=\"Joile%27s%20Archer\"&gt;Joile's Archer&lt;/a&gt;s: \"&lt;Shoot fatal arrows at Shinji and Baloth&gt;\"\n&lt;a href=\"Lord%20Trystan\"&gt;Lord Trystan&lt;/a&gt;: \"No! General Mercedene, what have you done?\"\nGeneral Mercedene: \"\"A duel for a city? Pathetic. &lt;a href=\"King%20Joile\"&gt;King Joile&lt;/a&gt; wanted victory and today, I deliver it!\"\nLord Trystan: \"Curse you General Mercedene! To the depths of &lt;a href=\"Oblivion%20%28Realm%29\"&gt;Oblivion&lt;/a&gt; I curse you!\"\"\nGeneral Mercedene: \"Fool! If you bear them so much love, fall and die beside them!\"\nAfter slaying &lt;a href=\"General%20Mercedene\"&gt;General Mercedene&lt;/a&gt;:\nLord Trystan: \"Stay your hand, young Orc. Too much blood was spilled this day. Enough heroes lost.\"\n&lt;a href=\"Rokaug\"&gt;Rokaug&lt;/a&gt;: \"Agreed. The duel... did you see it? Was there a victor?\"\nLord Trystan: \"\"I saw a willow and a &lt;a href=\"graht-oak\"&gt;graht-oak&lt;/a&gt;, dancing in the wind. I thought there styles vastly different, until I realized...\"\"\nRokaug: \"'\nAdhere to the style that defeats your opponent.'\n People used to claim it was Shinji's proverb. Always made Baloth crack a smile.\""}

Drink to &lt;a href=\"Tall%20Papa\"&gt;Papa&lt;/a&gt; and tell &lt;a href=\"Morwha\"&gt;Morwha&lt;/a&gt; you're sorry for what you've done wickedly this day save for the customary curses allowed towards our enemies, the fair skins and the green skins and the sataks that roll in the dirt with no skins at all. Most importantly, listen, here's another tale of Sura of the Bend'r Mark, the Maverick-Sword of &lt;a href=\"the%20Crowns\"&gt;the Crowns&lt;/a&gt;, called &lt;a href=\"Cyrus%20%28Redguard%29\"&gt;Cyrus&lt;/a&gt; in the tongue of the &lt;a href=\"Septim%20Dynasty\"&gt;Septims&lt;/a&gt;.\"\n\"Mind you, this story isn't necessarily true, for no tale of Cyrus the Restless is true in its entire, and yet that has never really mattered. Indeed, you'll come to see that sometimes stories that aren't necessarily true can still sometimes win the day. Now these were the days after the &lt;a href=\"Conquest%20of%20Hammerfell\"&gt;Tiber War&lt;/a&gt; had come to &lt;a href=\"Hammerfell\"&gt;Hammerfell&lt;/a&gt; with its banners and phalanxes and its skill at sea, which came to nothing except for treaty, for no empire of men may rule the sons and daughters of &lt;a href=\"Yokuda\"&gt;Yokuda&lt;/a&gt;. We are superior in every way to all the other races of this world and they know it. The &lt;a href=\"Hoon%20Ding\"&gt;Hoon Ding&lt;/a&gt; guides us; all others can Make Way. That is, unless those others do not come from this world at all, and are instead spirits of the &lt;a href=\"Aetherius\"&gt;Far Shores&lt;/a&gt; or the &lt;a href=\"Oblivion%20%28Realm%29\"&gt;In-Between--&lt;/a&gt; against these gods and demons and mad shapers, all men can be humbled. But is that not the point? Different rules apply to gods and demons and mad shapers. Of these, I talk now of the demon-king of the Star-Wounded East, &lt;a href=\"Vehk\"&gt;Vehk&lt;/a&gt; and Vehk the Circle Talker, anon Ansu-Gurleht in &lt;a href=\"Yoku\"&gt;Yoku&lt;/a&gt;, the God of Makes Us Women, whose powers are so terrible that even &lt;a href=\"Redguards\"&gt;Redguards&lt;/a&gt; must bend to His will, though foreign and thus benighted; if He comes, we run until we can't. There is no shame in this; we are allowed to run from disaster; witness the loss of Yokuda, where our running was blessed by windy &lt;a href=\"Tava\"&gt;Tava&lt;/a&gt; who filled our sails with escape. And Ansu-Gurleht is surely disaster. But there was one of us that didn't run from Him. Cyrus never ran from anything except for the killing of Hakan, and that was so long ago that it doesn't really count.\"\nThe captain had them restow the \"Carrick\" at Herne and once more at Jabbur before moving into the waters of &lt;a href=\"Abecean%20Sea\"&gt;the Abecean&lt;/a&gt;. The map to Old Yokuda came from the Lame Cat of &lt;a href=\"Wayrest\"&gt;Wayrest&lt;/a&gt;, like always. There was no agenda save the looting of a particular temple; at least that's all Cyrus would let on about; but some of the \"raga\" of the crew were eager just to see the homeland of their forebears. True stories had come that Yokus still lived among the stark remains; that some did not or could not flee when cataclysm came; others that the orichalc isles were a place of censure handed down from the \"&lt;a href=\"no-totambu\"&gt;no-totambu&lt;/a&gt;\". And everyone knew the self-exiled \"ansu\" still lived there who did not witness the \"ho no shira\", or the capture of Volen, or the Make Way of &lt;a href=\"Diagna\"&gt;Diagna&lt;/a&gt;, and so were left to the sword-singing of their histories behind the Curtain of Run.\nThe captain set their course south-southwest, slanting across the spring trades into the Sea of Pearls to the puzzlement of the crew. Some of the older among them muttered darkly of the guardians of the western approaches, but nothing was sighted during the long weeks of smooth sailing. At twilight on the 12th day out of Jabbur, Coyle, long-learned in the navigations, took sighting of the non-constellation of Sep and abruptly Cyrus changed course to the north. The old hands explained to the new that they had crossed the Line that day and it was now safe to bear up for Old Yokuda. The winds, which had been fair, now turned into the north and gusted with growing ferocity, often threatening to lay the \"Carrick\" on her beam if not for the skill of her crew. After weary days of this, they finally made landfall on the 17th day.\nCoyle, stay with the ship and start the trim. If the locals come, you speak the language. Anchor's dropped right, sir, and Borden's already got his raiders filed. Good, we move soon, night's falling. Take Haekele with you, Captain, he speaks Yoku, too, and reads it if he don't lie. Noted. We go to the spot S'rathra marked and nowhere else. \"Sen nung ni-Bateki tro ki-lodo.\" What? It's a prayer, Cap'n, to the God of We Like Our Bodies Just Like They Are. Fair enough. Ach, heathens help us. No offense, sir. It's a just tradition, Captain. Aye, these isles \"tro zhang-ga let.\" Shut up and get your kit.\nBy torchlight they made for the interior, badlands all of it and worse. Sharp drops would appear along the stone pathways or the high wet walls, all of it jagged from the mythic wars against the &lt;a href=\"Aldmer\"&gt;Aldmer&lt;/a&gt; and still gleaming with eldritch-foam. Cyrus was reminded of the geographies of &lt;a href=\"Morrowind\"&gt;Morrowind&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Masser\"&gt;Masser&lt;/a&gt;, though the wind smelled sweeter here. He choked out an order for rope to get them across the Tendu Shreds that was coming sooner than his crew had thought possible. Their captain had memorized the map, since he knew they would approach the temple under cover of night. He passed some licorice to Fornower, the youngest of those present.\nThe temple was nestled in the Shreds, unlit save for the foam that gave it an underwater glow, and Borden said a small word to Tsun to keep his cool. \"All in a day's,\" he said.\nBroken and worked, the temple held a glimmering language above its entrance. Haekele of Alik'r moved closer. Cyrus raised a hand.\n\"It's &lt;a href=\"Daedric%20Alphabet\"&gt;Daedric&lt;/a&gt;,\" the Captain said. \"I can read that.\"\nAt the mention of the Lords of Misrule, the crew of the \"Carrick\" were set to a heavier unease.\n\"'The Virtue of the Little Reward',\" Cyrus read aloud. Then he frowned at the writing. \"Well, I'm glad I could work that out for us.\" And then he guided them in.\nThe statue looks &lt;a href=\"dunmer\"&gt;dunmer&lt;/a&gt;. Shh. But that makes no sense, sir, they ain't much fer sailin. Just find the jewel if we can, this place looks pretty bare. Doesn't look ransacked, though. Cap, look there, that's probably why. It's a gate. That'd keep anyone out. Hand the torch. Move up, Gar, what's its aura read? Look on the walls. Shh, what's it read? We're fine, sir, it can't open, it's \u2018fire-locked. The Emperor's good for something then. I'm serious, look on the walls. Those kings, they aren't dunmer, they're \"raga\". No, they're women, see. All of them is with child. \"Look. For. The. Jewel.\" Oh no, Captain, this is a temple to Ansu-Gurleht! Who the hell is that?\nThey found that the jewel was in parts, three by three, one for each etching of the pregnant Yoku kings of the Temple of Ansu-Gurleht the Seed-Bringer. With careful knives they pried them out and by Gar's small enchantments they formed them into one, the Glass Opal of the Nogru.\n\"AI PADHOME ALTADOON!\"\nBorden took out his sword. \"That came from the gate, sir.\"\nCyrus looked at the arching columns of the temple center, long cracked by age and with traces of wheel-carvings. \"Yeah,\" he said.\nThe gate spoke again. \"Drop the bauble, rude shapes, I am bathing in pico-filament moltings that come in six beautiful colors the &lt;a href=\"Aurbis\"&gt;Aurbis&lt;/a&gt; hasn't even revealed yet, and I \"really\" do not want to make this journey. You should also know that I'm very dangerous.\"\n\"Move,\" Cyrus said, and the crew of the \"Carrick\" ran.\nThe route back to the beach was quicker, as they jumped what they had had to climb before, and the discretion of their movements they put aside as fast as the sun could rise. Some of them thought foolishly that daylight might keep their pursuer away, as he was undoubtedly a dark thing perhaps not given to new mornings, but Cyrus yelled at them to run. Better than Gar, he could feel when strange things were moving against him.\nThey ran across the sand towards the boats and their shipmates knew enough to start the casting off. \"Pull her up,\" Coyle yelled, \"They've caused trouble!\"\nThe wind fell around them, and then a shadow, and then a bright half-star behind. Cyrus turned to see, and maybe he was smiling because he liked this kind of thing, and from the rock edges Vivec appeared, making the men gasp. No one had expected a dunmer on these shores, nor one so oddly arraigned.\n\"I'll deal with him,\" Cyrus said, and Borden waited a second to receive the Opal, but his captain wouldn't toss it. \"No hard feelings, but I don't really trust you, Borden. Go!\"\nVivec was half-golden and half-blue and all of him glowing, and he was armored lightly, and carried a small shield and a curved sword at his side. His head was bald except for flame, and he smiled with evil.\n\"Stay back, dunmer,\" Cyrus said, eyeing his head. \"I can't have you burning my boat.\"\nVivec walked closer. Afterward, men aboard the \"Carrick\" said they could smell a fortune in bug-musk.\n\"You don't know me,\" Cyrus said, \"so I'll tell you once--\"\nAnd then Vivec spoke, and the winds of the beach died down when he did for he was the Lord of the Middle Air and they were indentured to him. He said to Cyrus, \"Oh, I know you, \"raga\". I know that you forced an armistice with the &lt;a href=\"Cyrodiil\"&gt;Cyrodiil&lt;/a&gt;, which I have done, though by other designs. I know also that even after speaking well and rendering your people free again, you remained a thief at heart in the days after; these days, in fact, which I have also done and still do, again in my own way.\"\nAnd here the god of the East smiled a bit too lovingly. \"And let it be said here that you have no idea how much I absolutely adore thieves.\"\nCyrus for his part was circling around Vivec, making a trough in the sand, some place in which to move easier when the fight came. His men watched from the deck of his ship. Some had brought bows and arrows, but Coyle moved them away with a hand.\nVivec lifted his legs to float in the lotus position, his head to the side with the smile vanished and replaced by a dole of remorse without mocking. \"I know how you die,\" he said, \"and the trouble your soul will have reaching the far shores of your taken stars because of things you did to the discredit of the Hist, and how their long roots run even into the void tendril-feeling for your final entrance. I know how you think now, at this moment, that there are no paths except for the drowned lamp, or the wrongheaded romance of saberplay in a landscape of long regret, taking whosoever will ride with you through the still-sought salvation spread across each water lash, wandering your heart to find some purchase beyond the admonishment of the moons; flagellant without end.\"\nVivec's eyes went to the Glass Opal cradled in the pirate's arm and frowned. He looked at Cyrus, dourly, saying, \"I know all of this about you, \"Sura\", and more, and it grants us a kinship despite your crime against me, and so it pains me yet that I think you really know nothing of me and my mastery. Or do you? I am the city that walks, the wise and benevolent eye of the &lt;a href=\"ALMSIVI\"&gt;ALMSIVI&lt;/a&gt;, and it has been such for uncounted red generations, each adding its mark then and forevermore, the worship of the construction-everlasting, Architect Amen. What could you possibly know of me?\"\nCyrus had never changed his expression. \"I know you're talking,\" he said, \"because I see your mouth moving and I hear words.\" And with that he dropped the stolen jewel and drew his saber.\nVivec then drew his own sword, slow yet perfectly, whipping around to angle it to his left. \"Hmm,\" he said. \"Yes, fine, I think.\"\nThe two moved in closer, Vivec gently floating so that the &lt;a href=\"bonemold\"&gt;bonemold&lt;/a&gt; of his right armor faced Cyrus. \"Death despite kinship has ever been our way,\" he said, \"I know too how it feels to murder the husband of my sister.\"\nAt this last, Cyrus was finally angered, understanding now that this champion of Morrowind was truly able to read his mind, which he had vouchsafed from even the closest to him, and this is why he hated all spirits of aether. It read on his face, which thereafter hardened. \"Tell me, demon,\" he asked, \"since you know how I die: is it this fight?\"\n\"No.\"\n\"Good to hear,\" Cyrus said, and attacked.\nVivec spun in midair cross-legged, never moving his swordarm from its initial position. He spoke, \"Fa-Nuit-Hen,\" the name of an old master, and Cyrus fell from eight wounds that appeared without mortal notice. Coyle could not stop the men from firing then.\nBleeding into the sand, Cyrus could see Vivec above him with no sword in his hand at all but instead the stolen jewel of the Nogru, and an array of seventeen arrows fanned around his firehead aspect peacock-style, caught by demon magic. Cyrus could not get up and Vivec spoke, \"And I know of your late father, the playwright, and though some of its local color is lost on me, I am fond of his work. That is why I have let you live. I adore poetry, too.\"\nThe Lord of the Middle Air vanished, and Coyle sent boats to the shore with medicines and their sugarcat surgeon, who had taken passage sometime after Herne.\nYou cannot go back. We must cast off. Captain, take us into this no more. A demon's mercy only comes once. Quit staring at your sword, sir. Yokuda was lost for a reason. Let's just go. Why not just send the crows an invitation in lights. Please, captain, let us cast off. I mean, we brought some from &lt;a href=\"Akavir\"&gt;Akavir&lt;/a&gt;, they'd see \u2018em surely. You can't even move. We've heard the stories of Ansu-Gurleht, the \"raga\" among us at least; the gods say it's okay to hightail it. Great work, Haekele, those were right magicsome words. Go get the &lt;a href=\"Good%20Skooma%20Pipe\"&gt;skooma-pipe&lt;/a&gt; and tell him it's a scalpel day again. Please let us just leave this haunted place. Cut up suits you, cap, pregnant don't; listen to the men. You cannot go back. With all due respect, sir, you're dumber than I look.\nNow in his time asleep or under the knife, Cyrus didn't know that Coyle had set out with a few other sailors, all of them Yoku-speakers. Knowing his captain too well, the young man went to find the fabled \"ansus\", the sword saints of orichalc. Coyle kept no hope that he should be so lucky\u2014the \"ansus\" kept their citadels hidden, and komodos protected them under color of rock. In the village of Bu-tabar, which topples down the eltheric breaks like survivor pearls, Coyle learned that the \"ansus\" were seeking to hold counsel with Cyrus anyway. He met them on the Samarand Road and they were three as in tradition- a young one, an aged one, and a daughter of neither. They had a train of followers to carry their sword collections and their memories-in-stone. Seeing the crew of the Carrick, the daughter \"ansu\" reenacted the Falls of Diag-leeki with twin falchions, playing every part; since she did so in under a minute, it meant \"hello-don't-be-useless\".\n\"I should warn you,\" Coyle told the elder in the old tongue, \"Captain Cyrus doesn't know any Yoku at all.\"\nCoyle brought the elder \"ansu\" and the young one to meet Cyrus in the surgeon's hold; the daughter stayed abovedecks with their train, to protect them and to warn the sailors with displays. The young \"ansu \"greeted the captain in Yoku, which Coyle translated for him. Cyrus merely nodded and lifted up, bandaged across his eight wounds, and the sugarcat hissed at the needless movement. Startled by the sound, the young \"ansu\" took a Walled Consequence stance. Coyle brushed the surgeon away quickly and finally the elder spoke.\n\"We know of you, \"Surahoon\",\" he said in the captain's own speech, \"And motions were multiplied the other morning on this beach, which is sword tremor, which we can feel, and that can only mean you encountered the Ansu-Gurleht.\"\nCyrus shrugged his shoulders. \"If you mean the dunmer wizard, yeah, he was here. I almost had him. And no funny talk.\"\nThe young \"ansu\" dropped his stance. \"He cannot be beaten,\" he told Cyrus, \"We know every sword move created in history, and none of them would avail you, even if you learned them from our &lt;a href=\"Memory%20Stone\"&gt;memories-in-stone&lt;/a&gt;, which we would be obliged to lend you if you asked. You killed the white king in the Hammerfell, after all.\"\n\"What?\" Cyrus said. \"The &lt;a href=\"Emperor\"&gt;Emperor&lt;/a&gt;? I didn't kill him.\"\n\"Of course you did; you were the Hoon Ding.\"\n\"No I didn't and no I wasn't.\"\nThe young \"ansu\" refused to listen. Behind his stone-feather mask he smiled in admiration. \"You disarmed him, even, and would not kill him until he showed another knife. That is \"ra gada\" honor. We do not fight the unprotected. Your stories have come\u2014\"\n\"That wasn't the Emperor,\" Cyrus said. \"That was just\u2014\"\n\"Of course it was. That is why the Hammerfell stands. You were the Hoon Ding. In any case, the Ansu-Gurleht cannot be beaten. He was gifted by the Barons of Move Like This, who record sword moves from the future, as well.\"\n\"Right,\" Cyrus sighed. \"Please remove yourself from my ship.\"\nCoyle went to his captain. \"\"Sura\",\" he whispered, \"nogo tur\u2014\"\n\"Not an option, Coyle.\" Cyrus turned to the ansu. \"Now go. The fight with the dunmer is my own. I appreciate the advice but you're\u2014\"\n\"Will you not take our memories-in-stone, at least?\"\n\"Why?\" Cyrus said. He tried to keep his temper. \"You've already said that they're useless against him.\"\nThe elder lifted a hand. \"The Hoon Ding could\u2014\"\n\"Look, I am not \u2013\"\n\"The Hoon Ding could read the stones and show you what we say is true\u2014that no move exists that will get past the Ansu-Gurleht.\"\nThe elder looked through the floor of the hold. \"At least not now,\" he said, \"The Hoon Ding would show you that he will not manifest in you in this fight.\"\n\"Good,\" Cyrus said. \"He'd get in my way.\" And with that he lay back down. The elder looked up from the floor, and set his head to the side.\n\"\"Surahoon\",\" he said, \"We are the \"ansu\", the greatest warriors that live in men. Our swords sent the &lt;a href=\"Lefthanded%20Elf\"&gt;Left-Handers&lt;/a&gt; into the oceans, whose empire was four times the size of the white king. When we fight, our swords can kill the laws of nature itself. Yokuda is as you see it because our \"hira-dirg\" swords can cut the \"atomos\", the uncuttable, and we did. We are the \"ansu,\" and we tell you now that you cannot beat the Ansu-Gurleht. How do you think he came by that name? Who do you think was our finest student?\"\nCoyle stepped back. He shook his head. Cyrus for his part just shrugged again.\n\"Then your finest student is a painted hussy,\" he said, \"And a foreign one at that. Great work. He's quick enough, sure, but I've cut down his kind before.\"\nCyrus lifted his head for a second, looking to Coyle. \"He talks a lot, too, and seems to like that. Is there a God of Talk to Death here, too?\"\n\"Yes,\" Coyle said, \"But Ansu-Gurleht is the\u2014\"\n\"Of course there is,\" Cyrus said, \"I can work with that, then. Hopefully he'll be holding his sword as he's yakking away so my Redguard honor will remain intact when I run my saber into his mouth mid-sentence.\"\nThe young \"ansu\" spoke with the elder's voice. \"We are telling the Hoon Ding to run.\"\nCyrus smiled and closed his eyes.\n\"Where's the money in that?\"\nBellguard down, over, hold. The Bone Shaver. Strike at 80 grams, any degree but this one. The Ephemeral Feint. Breathe in and then forget the breath; you cannot replace it until he is down, to fight as if dead: second principle of pneumansu. The Vectoring Cygnet. Arm out, knee down, coal on the teeth to hide your smile. The Pankratosword, but this is forbidden. Arc the bones that otherwise cannot bend. The Threat of Mirrors. Using the Math Athlete, you could occur several places during a single duel, illustrious and sure. Paint fake eyes all over your face and then hide your real ones among them; the opponent can no longer read where you look. The Premeditated Modesty. The Fingers-Knife serves as five, protecting your cardinal points and your central theory; five thrusts, spaced microseconds apart, like tapping the desk bored, waiting for morning bread.\nCyrus woke in the surgeon's hold, dark lapping sounds coming through wood. The cat was still up going through bottles and washing linens. Seeing his captain wince, he nodded and said, \"Bad moons in a big dream.\"\n\"Tell me about it.\"\n\"Before you even ask,\" the cat said, \"G'latha slipped no moonsugar in your last resting-water.\"\nCyrus moved to a sitting position, wincing slightly from some pain in his lower back. \"Then why?\" he said.\n\"The sword-walkers left a memory-stone under your pillow.\"\nCyrus moved the pillow and saw it: a dark rock weathered smooth with age, encrusted with traces of glistening curves. He glared at G'latha. \"And you knew about this?\"\n\"Yes,\" the cat said. \"G'latha found it amusing. Also, G'latha thought that maybe its magic would seep into your brainpan and teach you \"vaba maaszi lhajiito, do-sura\".\"\nCyrus got on his feet and grunted some admonishment. He found his sword near the cutter tools and hefted it, looking at its grip and wondering why it felt a bit off. Had the dunmer wizard knocked its balance out? Had he even set aside the saber in that whirling motion he'd made? Cyrus couldn't remember. He remembered only how ridiculously fast it had all been.\n\"That book also teaches \"&lt;a href=\"Ahzirr%20Traajijazeri\"&gt;ahzirr traajijazeri&lt;/a&gt;\",\" he said to G'latha.\n\"Did you ever notice we hid that lesson at the bottom? Speaking of lessons, it seems like \"do-sura\" learned a few.\"\n\"Yeah, there was a move called\u2014oww.\" Cyrus had attempted a swing but something across his skin tore sharply. \"I was going to make a joke in there somewhere about skinning \u2014oww. I reopened something.\"\n\"G'latha was serious. Did you not notice what you did?\"\nCyrus put his saber down. He was feeling dizzy. The sugarcat lent a hand.\n\"Here, sit back down for the needle,\" G'latha said. Pawing his captain's stitches lightly, his eyes flashed over to the sword.\n\"\"Do-sura\" fights right handed,\" he said, voice low, \"Yet you just held your saber with your \"left\".\"\nAs morning rose, Cyrus scanned the beach again from topside. Some men were moving about nervously. Thorpe, the scrub, was close by, swabbing the decks, whistling some song from Sutch or thereabouts.\n\"Thugs mustn't have ties to anything except ink and the glimmer of gold.\"\nThorpe looked up from his brush. \"What was that, sir?\"\n\"Nothing,\" Cyrus said, realizing he'd been heard. \"Something an old villain of mine said to me once.\"\n\"Ring a truth it's got,\" Thorpe said, going back to his work, \"And if ye don't mind me sayin' so, there's plenty of glimmer back homewards.\" Thorpe started nodding at his own advice. \"Scuttle's that the Reachers have taken to the water to fight Old Mary,\" he continued, \"and those Bret'n buttertubs couldn't outrun the \"Carrick\" on their best day.\"\n\"That's just it, Thorpe,\" Cryus sighed. \"The Reachers don't stand a chance against the Dominion. But they're trying. Same news you heard says the Thalmor sent a plague into Camlorn. It's a matter of\u2026\" And Cyrus let the sentiment trail off. He had taken an interest in the sunrise.\n\"What's that, sir?\" Thorpe said, eyeing him. \"Reconciling vengeance and honor again?\"\n\"Yoku has forty-eight different versions of honor,\" Cyrus said, \"And they all trace their roots to \"ugak-ta\", which means, more or less, \"I'm pretty mad.\" So that might be a yeah.\"\nFornower walked by, fetching a saw. \"Woke up speaking Yoku, cap?\" he said.\n\"Strange night,\" Cyrus said.\nThorpe let Fornower pass until he spoke again. \"Ain't a soul on this boat would think less of ye fer avoidin' that whip-evil Velothi domino, Cy.\"\n\"I know.\"\nCyrus palmed the top of his saber-hilt, thinking. He frowned as he felt the same imbalance in the blade, even in its sheathe. He sighed again and looked over to Thorpe.\n\"Actually, there would be one that would think less of me.\"\nSo it was that Cyrus the Restless came to a decision, which was ever preordained by his make, and let us not say that he did so easily, for that would be a lie, but still and alas: he was to meet the Ansu-Gurleht in single combat for satisfaction, if only the demon-king might be troubled again to show up. Cyrus had thought of ways to ensure this.\n\"Bring me maps and histories of the dunmer,\" he told the learned of his men, \"And bring any here that know of the Ansu-Gurleht's aspect beyond local legend.\"\nBorden showed with documents, for he was a reaver long, and had been to Morrowind before and after Armistice. He knew nothing much, however, of the dark elves beyond their ability to fight at raid time. \"He's not a Redoran, I can say that,\" Borden said, scrolling out papered territories and pointing, \"He was little armored, and those devils go weighted.\"\nIt was Gar that knew most of their dunmer politic, but he could not reveal much that wasn't tangled in old tale. \"He may be the one named Vivec, because he mentioned ALMSIVI, which is some kind of god guiser cabal in their belief, with great hold on their nation. This \"Vivec\" is the only one of that group that frolics about outside their borders so much; one might say he's their public face or something.\"\nCyrus snorted.\n\"I'm telling you just what I know, Captain. The Pocketguide says they never come out at all, the ALMSIVI. Better texts link him to the Daedroth Mephala.\"\n\"Oh,\" Borden added, \"Them Redorans also speak less distinguished than the dandyman you...well, I would say you fought, but that'd be generous in description. No offense, as always.\"\n\"Mephala?\" Cyrus said. \"Which Lord is that?\"\nGar flipped through a book, looking for something to back up what he was already going to say. \"The Webspinner in day parlance; otherwise it gets hazy. Ties to the Morag Tong, ties to sordid other cults in the provinces, running gamut from drugs to dibbledark to, hell, fashion trends even. Weird one, this Mephala.\"\n\"Weird is relative,\" Cyrus quoted.\nA crowd had gathered; men with rope or hidden eagerness or barely covered discomfort. Their captain was stubborn and famous for it. No matter the disposition, each \"Carricker\" needed to be a part. Coyle was among them, about to say something until Hiddleman spoke up.\n\"Prizewise, what yer talkin past all this \"raga\" noise is we get the Nogru Opal back, yeah?\"\nThe men of the \"Carrick\" shifted then, eyeing their captain and the dumb marine from Anvil. Coyle took the stead. He said, \"Yes, Hiddle. No action \"Sura\" decides goes tobr'a way. Settle in and give scandal no glance.\"\nCyrus took the heed, but his nature couldn't stop his color despite it. \"Listen, all of you. Runners were sent inland, and they're coming back with trade. The locals have never seen fireworks, and we stole plenty from Ko. Orichalc's en route in abundance, which will gather drake like even the oldest here have never witnessed. S'rathra's shiny is only going to make us richer, and I aim to get it back from that dunmer princess without a doubt.\"\nCyrus looked at the men to see the measure of their waver. \"Without a doubt, you hear,\" he said. \"Because no power lays me low like that on any ground, foreign or however-you-like. I'm Redguard. He insulted me, and let me live. In plain, don't trouble on my motive and your payday'll come tonight.\"\nHe looked to Borden. \"Bring me my armor.\" He turned to Gar. \"Find me the worst thing I might say to this Vivec.\" He turned to Coyle. \"Load the cutter. I go within the hour.\"\nWith no need for secrecy this time, Cyrus went a more direct route to the temple of the Ansu-Gurleht. Near a crossroads that split on the westernmost fall of the Tendus there was a wayside shrine to Morwha, with a sprawling statue inside of a fashion he had seen before in his own lands. He left coin there in a wax-hollowed candle holder on the goddess' knees and felt a sudden relief in the wound of his lower back. He nodded to the ugly, fat face of the Yoku mother spirits and gave thanks and moved on.\nThe day became hot, for he was unused to wearing chainmail and helm and greaves, and heavy padding underneath all of it. He'd done so at times, battled in armor, but even at war in M'kai or the Rim he went without it and relied on speed instead, because his fighting style did. There would be no speed against the demon-king of the dunmer, Cyrus had learned, only force and hard defense. His mind was heady with the sword-thought of the ansus. It was all of it breath and geometry of edge and lessons that were lost on him because he had not the physical training for them.\nHe wondered about the Barons of Move Like This and the impossibility of their designs; how they were an advantage of Vivec's that few warriors could compensate for. He wondered how that any stone-knowledge he'd absorbed had already been dealt with by a countermove that did not exist yet; and that the Ansu-Gurleht had no doubt trained in it. Finally, he wondered of various ways to just plain cheat.\n\"There is nothing you can say to insult this Tribune, Captain,\" Gar had said. \"He is divine and goes all back all eras. He has endured slights from every power-- of the dark, and of the starkeepers, and of the lesser royalty of Man-- and delivered them back with laughter. His main joy is foul effrontery, one could say, and will gain you nothing.\"\nCyrus told Gar he wasn't helping.\n\"Actually, I'm trying,\" Gar said. \"More than insulting him with something unlikely to earn anything but amused contempt, I'm afraid that he would counter with something worse. He has a godsmind, Captain. He knows he could unshake you, and you cannot suffer that to happen in your duel with him.\"\nIt had somehow rained only inland the past day. The earth near the Shredstart was soft and unlovely, broken by stream. Cyrus stopped and looked down a wide gulf, thinking in Yoku, \"netu anselim\", which was the small version of the thought \"turn back.\" Below, salmon leapt upwards along a low river in their unparsible function.\nAnother Yoku phrase almost rose, but Cyrus smothered it, saying only, \"Yes, that's just about right.\" The salmon and their desperate natal stretch was an answer he agreed to.\nHe set the unease of the stone-knowledge into his stomach, removing it for a moment to become again what he remembered himself to be and not what magic had wrought, the ancestor idioms breaking across a bank inside him.\nHe cursed the \"ansus\" for their interference. No one should be made to swallow a language whole. He looked to the fish again and shrugged, finally moving on. Yes, he thought, it's only a fool that picks which dooms he subscribes to if he has more than one that breach his sky...but, well, there you go.\n\"I'm coming for you, woman,\" he said, quickening.\nAnd when he saw that the entrance to the temple had been sealed by a seamless plane of ebony, Cyrus wondered if he had come for nothing. Then all thoughts of honor went away and he wondered instead if the \"Carrick\" had anything aboard that might cut godsblood, because he would be stinking rich.\nThen the right half of the ebony plane turned to gold, and both halves moved like fluid in the air, a vision of trapped rain raining along a hectic compass; and Vivec formed from this mercurial swirling and floated there, finally smiling. He had not changed in his arraignment, Cyrus noted. And he notices that I have. Great. Hush.\nVivec spoke. \"So the \"ansus\" I sent didn't ward you off, little cut? I willed them to, for I have mentioned my liking of thieves, and thus I sought to help you, \"raga doon\", Cyrus the Restless.\"\n\"Tung den uta-no-mongo, Ansu-Gurleht.\"\nVivec cocked his head, which lit aflame at the wondering. \"Well, something stuck, at least. And I give help whether you wish it or not. What I will not give is my toy of the westernmost west, the Opal of the Nogru, whose chieftains I lady-made in long ages before your kind came to the Tamri-el.\"\n\"We'll see about that,\" Cyrus said.\n\"Tenacity,\" Vivec said, drawing his sword swiftly, \"I adore that, too. I am the circumvention of the Black Hands of excess, and now have the rule of it, and it was not bought without tenacity. May I name you as wife after this is over?\"\nAnd with that the Ansu-Gurleht angled his sword down in the position he had done at the beach, point down, blade edge forward, 60 degrees rise-wise from the ground. He floated lotus fashion and stopped smiling. His eyes were watching the future, Cyrus knew, so think of a way around all of this, damn it.\nCyrus drew his saber, holding it left-handed in the Tempest Attrition.\nVivec was impressed and said so. \"That stance allows you a riposte,\" he said. Then he smiled again. \"If you're quick enough.\"\nCyrus moved to Havoc Canal and Vivec nodded. \"Better. Your build favors that. But what if I've enchanted my skin to harden at each instance?\"\nZero-sum Interrupt.\n\"Can you even do that, silly \"raga\"?\"\n\"Test me.\"\n\"No,\" Vivec said, \"For I would prefer to imagine that you could. It would mean that I would bleed prior to the cut itself, bypassing all healing; moreso, and this is what pleases me utmost... it would mean that I have indeed helped you.\"\nCyrus had his moment then, where he had maneuvered the duel from the start: pride. Pride was the Ansu-Gurleht's weakness. \"Milord,\" Cyrus said, \"Forgive me my little grace, but I deny your help again. Indeed, I turn my back to it, and betray it, and malign it. That should be familiar to you.\"\nVivec paused. \"It is,\" he said.\n\"As should this,\" Cyrus said, moving to the Pankratosword.\nVivec paused longer. And then he laughed loud. \"You would not!\"\n\"I say again, test me.\"\n\"You would destroy the home of your ancestors even more? And in the fashion that they had done, which is now forbidden in your hands?\"\nCyrus didn't move from his stance.\n\"All for an Opal which you could never thereafter spend?\"\n\"You would be finished,\" Cyrus said. \"And I would be rid of the one who shamed me. So why wouldn't I? You shouldn't have sent your saints to me, Ansu-Gurleht. I am not much like them at all.\"\n\"Cut the \"atomos\" and you die, too.\"\n\"What, the Barons of Move Like This didn't teach you a countermove to this?\" Cyrus said. \"Oh, wait, they wouldn't have. The Pankratosword is stricken from the record.\"\nVivec laughed again. He was delighted. He said, \"The things they said about you were true, Redguard, whether you wish to believe it or not.\"\nVivec bowed his head.\n\"I make way,\" he said. \"I drop my sword.\"\nAnd the demon-king did, though it hovered a few inches from the ground.\nVivec continued. \"And thus we come to stalemate, for I am unarmed and you cannot--\"\n\"No,\" Cyrus said, moving his sword to Vivec's throat, \"You overestimate my Redguard honor, boy. Different rules apply to gods and demons and mad shapers. And you, Ansu-Gurleht, you're all three.\"\n\"I should kiss you,\" Vivec smiled.\n\"The jewel'd do better,\" Cyrus said, \"Thank you very much. Summon it, send it to my ship, and we're done.\"\n\"This is what you ransom for your shame,\" Vivec said, chiding, the Opal of Nogru floating out from within the temple. It flew off south and east. \"You're easily bought.\"\nCyrus turned to go, but Vivec stopped him, saying,\"And I had so wanted to see the Pankratosword, and so believed you ired enough to bring its ruin on us both. What stopped you, \"Surahoon\"?\"\n\"Old advice,\" Cyrus said. And he pointed his saber to Vivec's face and its two colors. \"And you're wearing it, sure enough.\"\nAt the apex of the temple's upper reaches, Cyrus turned back, calling to Vivec. \"Ink and gold, milord,\" he said. \"And the general mystery of dangerous men, you see. Well met, Tribune, and farewell.\"\nHe left the Ansu-Gurleht forever.\nAnd that's how the story goes, with a duel that was not a duel, and with a story that wasn't true. Cyrus, you see, never knew how to actually use the Pankratosword, only how to hold it at threat. After all, its use was forbidden and thus held in no stone at all after the fall of Old Yokuda.\nWhen he returned to his ship, the \"Carrickers\" cheered and asked loudly over one another the same questions: how the fight went with the Ansu-Gurleht, and how their captain had become the victor. Cyrus smiled then, and wouldn't answer, moving them to hustle and trim, for they were casting off.\nIt was Fornower who got the truth of it, handing Cyrus half a bit of licorice. \"For your mighty deeds, now plus one: some bitten-on licorice of the Bay\" he said. \"But, c'mon, Cap, and tell just me, then. How'd you beat him?\"\n\"Yeah, well,\" Cyrus said. He chewed and swallowed. \"I cheated.\"\nTHE END"}

I'll deal with those sub-humans once I sit upon the throne of Wayrest. First it is important to solidify my power base. I can (almost certainly) rely on Gothryd to support my bid for the throne, if Helseth is made heir. I have a spy network equalling &lt;a href=\"Eadwyre\"&gt;Eadwyre&lt;/a&gt;, Gothryd, &lt;a href=\"Akorithi\"&gt;Akorith-i&lt;/a&gt;, or the Emperor. Perhaps &lt;a href=\"Worm%20Cult\"&gt;the Necromancers&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Underking\"&gt;Underking&lt;/a&gt;'s networks are more extensive, but I doubt it. The problem is raw physical power. I do not have a standing army. I need the gold to raise\u2026"}

{"id": "34405", "revid": "50714989", "url": "https://elderscrolls.fandom.com/wiki?curid=34405", "title": "Lore", "text": "Lore is\u00a0the term used by most fans to refer to the information about the setting of universe. It covers a range of topics, such as geography, history, and metaphysics, which combine to describe the nature of the setting.\nSources of lore.\nLore can come from a range of sources, which are discussed below.\nThe Elder Scrolls games.\nMost of the lore that exists in \"The Elder Scrolls\" universe comes from each of the \"Elder Scrolls\" games that have been published, along with their &lt;a href=\"Official%20Plug-ins\"&gt;expansions&lt;/a&gt;:\nMost of the lore in the games is presented in the form of in-game books and character dialogue, which supply information about the setting from a particular perspective. However, the presence of some objects or people in the games may in itself constitute lore for the setting. For example, the mere presence of &lt;a href=\"Jarl%20Balgruuf%20the%20Greater\"&gt;Jarl Balgruuf the Greater&lt;/a&gt; as &lt;a href=\"Jarl\"&gt;Jarl&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"Whiterun\"&gt;Whiterun&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"4E%20201\"&gt;4E 201&lt;/a&gt; implies that he was, in lore, Jarl at that time.\nLore versus gameplay.\nHowever, there are differences between the setting as presented in in-game texts and dialogue and in the games themselves. This is most obvious in the case of city populations. For example, \"Oblivion\" has 1,839 named NPCs, and yet there is reference to \"thousands\" of rice workers in the east of the province alone in a text. Differences like this mean that how something is represented in the games may not match their precise nature in lore.\nThe events of the games themselves as carried out by the players also constitute lore in the definition given above. The exact status of some of these events is unclear; for example, if a given quest is not completed by the player character, is it considered done in the history of the universe? Due to the imprecise nature of referencing past games this is rarely if ever confirmed. A common opinion that resolves this problem is that each game protagonist completes the games' main questline, but other quests are completed by someone, who may or may not be the game protagonist. However, in a few instances, such as the &lt;a href=\"Kill%20the%20Telvanni%20Councilors\"&gt;Kill the Telvanni Councilors&lt;/a&gt; \"Morrowind\" quest, there is some evidence that the quest was not carried out.\nChanges made due to gameplay reasons sometimes get an explanation in the lore. The most prominent example of this is the landscape of &lt;a href=\"Cyrodiil\"&gt;Cyrodiil&lt;/a&gt;. This is described in the &lt;a href=\"Pocket%20Guide%20to%20the%20Empire%2C%20First%20Edition\"&gt;Pocket Guide to the Empire, First Edition&lt;/a&gt; as mostly being \"endless jungle,\" and yet the game \"Oblivion\" portrays it as forested. This is explained in a variety of places as having been changed after &lt;a href=\"Tiber%20Septim\"&gt;Tiber Septim&lt;/a&gt;'s conquest of Tamriel, may have been a scholarly error in the &lt;a href=\"Pocket%20Guide%20to%20the%20Empire%2C%20First%20Edition\"&gt;Pocket Guide to the Empire&lt;/a&gt;, or happened as a result of a change in ownership of the White-Gold Tower. Similarly, changes to the game engine between Morrowind and Oblivion meant that cities needed to be built in self-contained cells, and therefore levitation spells were not included as they were incompatible with the new cell structure. This was explained in the lore by the introduction of a &lt;a href=\"Levitation%20Act\"&gt;Levitation Act&lt;/a&gt; in Imperial Law, passed in &lt;a href=\"3E%20421\"&gt;3E 421&lt;/a&gt;.\nElder Scrolls books.\nThere are a variety of printed books that have been made available which contain lore information. These fall into various different categories and are discussed below.\nElder Scrolls novels.\nThere have been two novels published set in \"The Elder Scrolls\" universe: and . These are centered around the &lt;a href=\"Umbriel\"&gt;Umbriel&lt;/a&gt; Crisis, which occured between the events of and .\nManuals and Pocket Guides.\nEach game is accompanied by one or more written manuals which largely focus on in-game quest walkthroughs, character builds, statistics, and other data. However, they often contain a significant amount of information related directly to the wider lore of the series. Some of these books include \"&lt;a href=\"The%20Daggerfall%20Chronicles\"&gt;The Daggerfall Chronicles&lt;/a&gt;\", \"\", and the \"&lt;a href=\"Hero%27s%20Guides%20to%20The%20Elder%20Scrolls%20Online\"&gt;Hero's Guides to The Elder Scrolls Online&lt;/a&gt;\". Depending on the manual, they may be written from an in-universe or out-of-universe perspective.\nThe physical disk copy of \"The Elder Scrolls Adventures: Redguard\" came with a booklet entitled \"&lt;a href=\"Pocket%20Guide%20to%20the%20Empire%2C%20First%20Edition\"&gt;Pocket Guide to the Empire, First Edition&lt;/a&gt;\" in the case. The collectors edition of \"The Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion\" came with the \"&lt;a href=\"Pocket%20Guide%20to%20the%20Empire%2C%20Third%20Edition\"&gt;Third Edition&lt;/a&gt;\" of the \"Pocket Guide\" included in the case. These texts have never been depicted in games (other than an excerpt of \"The Pocket Guide to the Empire, \"First Edition\" \"in \"The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim\"'s load-screens), but are written from an in-universe perspective.\nPrinted anthologies.\nThe in-game books are collated in a range of printed texts, such as the \"\" anthology containing texts from \"The Elder Scrolls Online,\" or \"The Skyrim Libraries\", which does the same for \"Skyrim\". However, these merely reproduce existing texts from the games with additional artwork, and do not contribute new information to the lore.\nDeveloper interviews and texts.\nAt various points during the development of the series, particularly in the 1990s and early 2000s, game developers would frequently post in-character information on the official Bethesda forums and their own websites. These often elaborated on ideas and concepts that are only tangentially addressed in the games. One particularly prevalent writer of these texts, and the most commonly associated with them, is &lt;a href=\"Michael%20Kirkbride\"&gt;Michael Kirkbride&lt;/a&gt;, who continued writing such texts long after other developers retreated from this form of audience engagement.\nSome of these texts have been included in \"The Elder Scrolls\" games after their publication, or referenced by the games without necessarily including all or any of the original text itself. A notable example of this sort of inclusion is in &lt;a href=\"Heimskr%23Sermon\"&gt;Heimskr's sermon&lt;/a&gt;, which includes a portion of \"&lt;a href=\"From%20The%20Many-Headed%20Talos\"&gt;From The Many-Headed Talos&lt;/a&gt;\".\nSome \"The Elder Scrolls\" fans consider these texts to be valid sources of lore about the series, while others do not (see &lt;a href=\"Lore%23Canonicity%20and%20the%20Elder%20Scrolls\"&gt;Canonicity and Elder Scrolls Lore&lt;/a&gt; below).\nNature of lore.\nThe Unreliable Narrator.\nLore in \"The Elder Scrolls\" uses a narrative device called the Unreliable Narrator, whereby the person or thing conveying information may not be telling the whole truth, either because they do not know the truth, have a particular agenda to promote or wish to willfully deceive their audience. Typically, a source of lore within \"The Elder Scrolls\" will have a definite or implied person or group of people presenting the information, giving it a context and possible set of reasons for it to be true or false.\nThis means that the information presented to players and readers by its nature requires interpretation and a degree of skepticism in order to arrive at an accurate picture of a particular event or thing, or even that a totally accurate retelling is impossible. A particularly prominent example of this is the various accounts surrounding the &lt;a href=\"Battle%20of%20Red%20Mountain\"&gt;Battle of Red Mountain&lt;/a&gt;.\nCanonicity and Elder Scrolls lore.\nA canon is an accepted body of texts that are considered authoritative or true. Due to a combination of both the Unreliable Narrator and the presence of the developer interviews and texts elaborated above, there is some debate among fans about the canonicity of certain lore concepts or particular pieces of developer texts.\nSome fans consider that only material officially published by Bethesda Studios and its licencees can be considered to be valid lore. Others have a broader view of the canon, including developer interviews and texts\u2014often referred to as \"unlicensed texts,\" \"out-of-game texts,\" or \"obscure texts,\" despite (in some cases) the Bethesda-licenced novels and Pocket Guides technically falling under this category as well\u2014as valid lore. Others reject the notion of a set canon altogether, and uphold subjective canonicity.\nThe nature of canon and its place in \"The Elder Scrolls\" universe is still a point of contention for many in \"The Elder Scrolls\" lore community. One text that is particularly divisive is &lt;a href=\"C0DA\"&gt;C0DA&lt;/a&gt;, written by &lt;a href=\"Michael%20Kirkbride\"&gt;Michael Kirkbride&lt;/a&gt;, which implicitly calls for an end to the notion of canon. Bethesda has not to date taken an official position on the canonicity or non-canonicity of any texts.\nScope of the lore.\nMuch of the lore is comprised of recorded events that are not experienced in any of the games.\u00a0Most of the lore in comes from the continent of &lt;a href=\"Tamriel\"&gt;Tamriel&lt;/a&gt;, in which all the games to-date have taken place. The lore itself may describe places beyond Tamriel, which include other continents or realms of existence.\nRealms.\nThere are three realms in \"The Elder Scrolls\" universe. These are:\nEras.\nIn \"The Elder Scrolls\", there are &lt;a href=\"Eras\"&gt;Eras&lt;/a&gt; that divide the &lt;a href=\"timeline\"&gt;timeline&lt;/a&gt; into sections. These are all reckoned by various events in Tamriel's history:\nGeography of Nirn.\nTamriel.\nThe continent of Tamriel is divided into nine provinces:\nOther regions.\nThere are several other known regions on Nirn. Much of what is known of these places comes from Tamrielic sources.\nCosmology &amp; religion.\nThere are a wide variety of religions in Tamriel, mostly tied to a single dominant culture. These are discussed in the &lt;a href=\"Pantheons\"&gt;Pantheons&lt;/a&gt; article.\nThe cosmology itself involves several common concepts. An outline of some of these are:"}

We offer our most sincere apologies to the Chancellor again for spilling our tea on him\u2014entirely on accident\u2014upon hearing his very fair criticisms of our humble Archive and its collection.\nThe next Loremaster's Archive will feature Arthenice Belloq, author of \u201cA Life Barbaric and Brutal,\" who plans to present a new lore book about the Reachmen.\nTHE SLAVE REBELLION \u2013 MAN'S TRIUMPH.\nBy Chancellor Abnur Tharn\nThe ruination that came to the Ayleids was inevitable. It was not, as less astute scholars postulate, due to the will of the Aedra or some absurd mystical agent, but was a result of their degenerate Daedra worship and gross underestimation of their slaves. The human leaders who challenged the Ayleids, Saint Alessia in particular, recognized the cultural rot weakening their captors and took advantage of it to orchestrate one of the greatest triumphs of Men.\nThe debauched Elves were apparently quite creative when it came to devising new horrors to inflict on their slaves. What a shock that practices such as \u201cflesh-sculpture\" would drive the tormented men and women of Cyrodiil to rebellion. In their smug complacency, the Elves could not conceive of the possibility of an uprising\u2014which was well for the slaves, who would have been summarily crushed by the Ayleids at the height of their power.\nAs evidenced by the ruins found throughout Tamriel, the Ayleids were an incredible force. The source of their prodigious might, however, was also the catalyst of their decline. Deals with Daedric Princes granted them the power they sought. They thought themselves in control\u2014typical Elven arrogance\u2014as poison crept into their society. The various Daedric cults began bickering and backstabbing, as is their wont, forming the cracks the rebellion would exploit.\nAnother critical factor in the dissolution of Ayleid rule was the indomitable will of the oppressed. We have all read accounts of heroic deeds executed by the likes of Alessia, Morihaus, and Pelinal Whitestrake. While it's obvious to anyone with a modicum of intellect that these tales are a bit hyperbolic, it is quite clear that exceptional individuals made the establishment of the First Empire possible.\nAlessia's Slave Army was populated with many examples of the true potential of Man. It is a pity that more texts have not survived, for the few we retain give us little insight, and dishonest scholars often distort them for slanderous political purposes. My own ancestor, \u201cTharanus Ye Redde-Hand,\" has been painted as either a slave-overseer or even implied to be Tharhan, the Mutilant of the Gradual Massacre, based on ridiculous interpretations of obscure and questionable footnotes. The jealousy of lesser men, while I do so savor it, can be such an annoyance at times.\nIn reality, based on the rare texts I have had the privilege of consulting in the vaults of White-Gold itself, including the recently-discovered Scroll of Precursor Saints, Tharanus was a critical supporter of Alessia's cause, disrupting supply routes through forged logistical orders and even leading his own battalion into some of the war's bloodiest conflicts. Sadly, the slanderous have sunk so low as to make preposterous accusations that I forged the scroll myself. Despicable.\nGiven the weakness of the Ayleids and the rather inspiring members of Alessia's retinue, the outcome of the war was determined before the first slaver was beheaded. The Slave Rebellion both teaches a cautionary lesson about the idiocy of trifling with the Daedra and demonstrates the power of men, who have rightfully ruled the heart of Tamriel since. As they always shall.\nCHANCELLOR ABNUR THARN ANSWERS YOUR QUESTIONS:.\nLord Tharn, your noble family's role in the Alessian slave rebellion is well known, but one figure that always intrigued me is the mysterious Arch-Prelate Fervidius Tharn himself. Details about the man are rare. Would the kind Chancellor be willing to shed some light on the matter? - Archivist Jimeee of the United Explorers of Scholarly Pursuits\nChancellor Abnur Tharn says, \u201cI am pleased by your question, good archivist, for it gives me an opportunity to set the record straight about a man who is often mischaracterized and misunderstood. My ancestor, Fervidius Tharn, began his calling with the Alessian Order as a humble oblate, but as his merits and character became apparent\u2014good breeding always tells, does it not?\u2014he was given greater and greater responsibility, in time becoming arch-prelate of the entire order. Though at that period the arch-prelate wielded power almost as great as that of the emperor, Fervidius still had powerful enemies, both inside and outside the order. The greatest of these threats was a fanatical schism of the Alessians called the Marukhati Selective. Arch-Prelate Fervidius learned that the zealots of the Selective were scheming to bring about some sort of mystical re-engineering of the Aurbis by finding and combining the eight parts of an artifact called the Staff of Towers. These segments had been deliberately separated and hidden early in the First Era due to the threat posed by the complete Staff. Fervidius sent agents of the Order out to find these segments\u2014not, as some have said, to assist the Marukhati Selectives, but to sequester the segments where the Selectives could not get at them. Alas, in the end the arch-prelate, ever a trusting man, was betrayed by his closest allies, and his courageous stand against the Selectives cost him his very life.\"\nMy question for you, Chancellor, is that during the Alessian Rebellion, why were the Barsaebic Ayleids of my native Black Marsh not targeted as a potential threat or source of allies for the two conflicting sides (and the same for the Saxhleel ourselves)? I would think their proximity would result in some action from them, but nothing seems to be recorded in The Imperial Library. But we know how much you care for authenticity and accuracy, eh Tharn? \u2013 Eis Vuur Warden, Wayward and Contract Scholar\nChancellor Abnur Tharn says, \u201cMy dear Warden, you wound me, truly you do, with your implications. Those who put the boot into another should take care, lest they become boots themselves, if you take my meaning. But I digress. The Barsaebics, of course, were on the Aedric side in the Ayleid civil conflict known as the Narfinsel Schism, and were driven out of Cyrodiil by the Daedra-worshipers in the Scouring of Wendelbek. As this took place only a half-century before Alessia's Slave Revolt, the humiliation of exile still stung for the Barsaebics; when King Glinferen of Atatar sent an envoy to Gideon call for aid against the rebellious Nedes, the Barsaebic king (I'm afraid his name is lost to history) sent him back with a blunt refusal. Why didn't Alessia, who had other Ayleids among her allies, call on the Barsaebics to join her? We don't know that she didn't\u2014all we know is that such an alliance never took place.\"\nLet's get the facts straight. Was Morihaus a bull, or a man, or a man-bull, or what? We need to know! -Imperial Scholar Aidius Lutrus\nChancellor Abnur Tharn says, \u201cAs one Imperial scholar to another, Aidius, I am surprised to hear you use the word 'facts' about an individual known to us only through the medium of myth. In 'fact,' it matters not whether Morihaus was man, bull, or Eidar cheese\u2014what matters is how his saga supports the national narrative of the Empire, and how belief in the might and righteousness of Morihaus informs the self-image of the average Cyrodiil. The creation story of the Empire has no purpose or meaning beyond its support of the Empire's continuation. If this is news to you, perhaps it is time to review the continuation of your Imperial stipend.\"\nI wish to know your opinion on Alessia. Why did Akatosh favor her cause\u2014indeed, the cause of all Imperials, and grant her the Amulet of Kings? - Alessandra of Cyrodiil\nChancellor Abnur Tharn says, \u201cAh, but of course you already know the answer, loyal Alessandra. Do you simply wish to hear the truth spoken again from the very lips of the High Chancellor? If so, I am happy to indulge you. Repeat, along with me, the words that cannot be gainsaid, the truth that cannot be questioned: 'Saint Alessia, through her purity and wisdom, earned the love of all good beings, mortal and immortal. At Sancre Tor she prayed to Akatosh for the liberation of her people, and the Time Dragon granted her Three Visions to guide her in this task. Though the road was long and filled with hardship, her faith sustained her. When at last all three visions had come to pass and her people were freed of Elven domination, her purpose was fulfilled and she was called to Apotheosis. Then was she inducted into sainthood by Akatosh himself, and granted the Amulet of Kings, for the sacred rulers of the Empire to wear for ever and beyond.' There, Alessandra. Blessed be the Divines.\"\nAs a young woman, I was taught that our ancestors were called 'Nedes'. Some historical texts suggest the Nedes are the aboriginal humans of Tamriel. Others, such as the Dunmeri sagas, suggest they came from Atmora, and were cousins of the Nords. I know you have a deep interest in the genealogy of your own esteemed bloodline, milord, as well as a strong nationalistic pride in Nibenay and its accomplishments, so I'll assume you have an opinion on the matter of the identity of Nedes. Just who were our enigmatic ancestors, sire, and where did they come from? \u2013 Laurina Berne, Master Enchanter, Battlemage Corps\nChancellor Abnur Tharn says, \u201cExcellent questions, upon matters to which many of our finest scholars have devoted their entire lives. Before Khosey's 'Tamrilean Tractates,' which date to around 1E 200, the historical record is fragmentary to entirely nonexistent. This places us in the realm of conjecture, but from common elements in the oral traditions of the Cyro-Nedic tribes, certain probabilities can be adduced. The origin of the Nedes was undoubtedly the northern continent of Atmora, but the Nedic tribes did not all come to Tamriel at once; they came in waves, over a period of centuries, one tribal group at a time. These tribes were far from homogeneous: though all came from Atmora, some were as different from each other as Reachman and Redguard. The term 'Nedic Tribes' actually covers a wide panoply of different human cultures from different parts of Atmora, with a variety of traditions and practices. For the Nedes, Tamriel became a great mixing cauldron\u2014some Atmoran practices were retained, but many were lost. In Nibenay alone do we find the kind of continuity that sheds light on original Nedic culture, for only here were the great, old traditions maintained in any fidelity. Thus, when you look at a Nibenese, you see the closest thing to a pure-bred Nede still remaining on this continent.\""}

This entry was &lt;a href=\"https%3A//www.elderscrollsonline.com/en-us/news/post/62317\"&gt;published&lt;/a&gt; on 06/14/2022.\nContents.\nGentle readers, I bid you salutations from Mandrake Manor, my home on &lt;a href=\"High%20Isle\"&gt;High Isle&lt;/a&gt;! I can hear rain pelting the windowpanes as I put quill to parchment, a delightful evening shower after a day of beautiful weather and pleasant company.\nI must admit, it is not often that I am asked to write on matters of state and society. In truth, my fingers are rarely ink-stained these days for any reason, but the request came from Lord Bacaro himself. Along with a fine bottle of Abecean brandy.\nSo, given my new role as troubleshooter for the &lt;a href=\"Society%20of%20the%20Steadfast\"&gt;Society of the Steadfast&lt;/a&gt;, I am happy, even delighted, to scrawl these responses to your considered questions. Imagine me, if you must, feet up before a roaring fire with a generous pour in my glass. Let\u2019s get to it.\nWhen did &lt;a href=\"Bretons\"&gt;Bretons&lt;/a&gt; first settle the Systres? How impactful of a &lt;a href=\"Direnni\"&gt;Direnni&lt;/a&gt; influence was there on the first settlers, and how has the culture of the archipelago historically been affected by the shift of power from &lt;a href=\"Mer\"&gt;Elven&lt;/a&gt; to &lt;a href=\"Men\"&gt;human&lt;/a&gt; hands?\n\u2014Cosmo_Nova\nAn excellent question to start us out, my dear. You have given me an opportunity to pull a volume from the works of Trilam Heladren. Crisp, intelligent writing and fine publishing from the &lt;a href=\"University%20of%20Gwylim\"&gt;University of Gwylim&lt;/a&gt;. Trilam notes that the first proper settlers on the isles were the druids, who arrived sometime around the year 330 of the &lt;a href=\"1st%20Era\"&gt;1st Era&lt;/a&gt;. These religious migrants were caught between a rock and a hard place, the Direnni Elves on one side and the zealots at the heart of the rising &lt;a href=\"Alessian%20Empire\"&gt;Alessian Empire&lt;/a&gt; to the other.\nTo my knowledge, the Systres Archipelago is one of the few spits of rock in the &lt;a href=\"Abecean%20Sea\"&gt;Abecean&lt;/a&gt; that were not claimed by an expansive Elven empire. Which is not to say that Elves have never ruled here (more on that below). The original culture of the islands, then, was druidic. Imported from the ancient forests of &lt;a href=\"High%20Rock\"&gt;High Rock&lt;/a&gt;, druidic beliefs can be seen as a solemn response to the high-minded mercantile nature of their Elven overlords.\nThe druids of old saw &lt;a href=\"Y%27ffre\"&gt;Y'ffre&lt;/a&gt; and nature herself as the antidote to the heartless deprivations of their homeland. In a way, these early days here on the isles marked the start of modern druiddom. The line of their ancient kings would come to an end, the circles were formed, and their stewardship of nature allowed them to put down roots (so to speak) that survive to this day.\nIt has come to my attention the &lt;a href=\"Systres\"&gt;Systres&lt;/a&gt; were once what the &lt;a href=\"Sinistral%20Elves\"&gt;Sinistrals&lt;/a&gt; called home. How has that influenced the culture of the druids living on this archipelago, if at all? Furthermore, these islands seem to be rather close to &lt;a href=\"Thras\"&gt;Thras&lt;/a&gt;, unless my maps are somehow incorrect. Are &lt;a href=\"Sload\"&gt;Sload&lt;/a&gt; a concern?\n\u2014Inari of &lt;a href=\"Great%20Houses\"&gt;Great House&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"House%20Telvanni\"&gt;Telvanni&lt;/a&gt;\nA truly fascinating tale to be found here, so thank you for asking! The Sinistral Mer, or \"Lefthanded Elves,\" were said to be the enemies of the &lt;a href=\"Na-Totambu\"&gt;Na-Totambu&lt;/a&gt; royalty of the &lt;a href=\"Yokudan\"&gt;Yokudan&lt;/a&gt; continent. If you're unfamiliar with &lt;a href=\"Yokuda\"&gt;Yokuda&lt;/a&gt;, gentle reader, the ancestral home of the &lt;a href=\"Redguards\"&gt;Redguard&lt;/a&gt; is located far to the west of the Systres islands. So many beautiful tales from that part of the world. I recommend the tome \"&lt;a href=\"The%20Ubiquitous%20Sinking%20Isle\"&gt;The Ubiquitous Sinking Isle&lt;/a&gt;\" for an interesting analysis of lost Yokuda.\nTales that survived this somewhat eventful period in Systres history speak of refugees from Yokuda landing on High Isle, &lt;a href=\"Galen\"&gt;Galen&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Amenos\"&gt;Amenos&lt;/a&gt; roughly three hundred years after the druids. Antiquarians have confirmed this through a number of physical remnants, though\u2014to answer your question, my dear\u2014I don\u2019t feel personally these new arrivals had a significant impact on druidic culture. The druid circles' reaction to these invaders was to fade into the wilds as much as possible, hiding in caves along the waterfront and deep in the jungles of Amenos.\nAs for the Sload, well, I would say they're always a concern, aren't they? I find them quite concerning. But as far as physical proximity to Thras, it's worth noting that maps that show a \"Thrassian Reef\" or anything of that nature are by necessity mapping a mostly underwater civilization to the islands we landwalkers use to navigate. There have been no Sload attacks here on High Isle in centuries, and I'll raise my glass in hopes there are none here anytime soon.\nDespite now being a decidedly Bretonic archipelago, there are signs of habitation from many different races in the Systres Archipelago, possibly including those from Sunken Yokuda?\n\u2014Aramithius, Writer in Uncertainty\nAn excellent question, expanding on the discussion of the Sinistral Mer your cohort asked above! It's true, Bretons have left many footprints in the sand here in the Systres. Unfortunately, lasting signs of Yokudan-diaspora habitation are next to nil.\nWe've already discussed the refugees from the west landing and conquering these beautiful isles. Whether they were indeed Lefthanded Elves or, as some scholars argue, Yokudan enemies of the No-Totambu given that name, they held the Systres in their grip for a few hundred years after their wave of conquest swept the Systres.\nBut, as we all know, some waves crash harder than others. Late in the first millennium, &lt;a href=\"Frandar%20Hunding\"&gt;Frandar Hunding&lt;/a&gt;'s &lt;a href=\"Ra%20Gada\"&gt;Ra Gada&lt;/a&gt; sailed past the archipelago. Their conquests in the &lt;a href=\"Alik%27r\"&gt;Alik'r&lt;/a&gt; have become the stuff of legend, but their relatively brief stop on High Isle cleared it of western invaders with a swift and ruthless exhibition of the &lt;a href=\"sword-singer\"&gt;sword-singer&lt;/a&gt; tradition. Whether the previous invaders were Mer or not, they were clearly enemies of the Ra Gada. As a result, though some druid tales still tell of this brief period in the island\u2019s history, few and far between are the tangible signs of their passing.\nCertainly, we have none of the beautiful ruins or architectural elements to be seen in the desert near &lt;a href=\"Sentinel\"&gt;Sentinel&lt;/a&gt; or the steppes near &lt;a href=\"Hallin%27s%20Stand\"&gt;Hallin's Stand&lt;/a&gt;. I hope that does not disappoint. I can assure you we have many beautiful ruins and castles to view here, but they are all of the old-and-moldering-Bretonic style. More's the pity.\nI've heard rumors of strange deerfolk and crabfolk sightings within the archipelago. If they truly exist, are these beings forms of &lt;a href=\"beastfolk\"&gt;beastfolk&lt;/a&gt;? Do they have cultures of their own, or are they more akin to the &lt;a href=\"Yaghra\"&gt;Yaghra&lt;/a&gt; which have been plaguing &lt;a href=\"Summerset\"&gt;Summerset&lt;/a&gt; of late?\n\u2014LickingHistSap\nAh, yes, yes. The &lt;a href=\"Fauns\"&gt;Fauns&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Hadolids\"&gt;Hadolids&lt;/a&gt;. Fascinating creatures, though by their very nature not terribly well understood. My apologies, dear, I should not say creature: they have kith and kin, signs of culture, and a history all their own. But in nearly all circumstances, the interactions between Men or Mer and these beastfolk are violent, painful, and cruel.\nThe Hadolids are, as you say, a sort of crabfolk being that lives primarily underwater. Much of the mystery of their culture stems from their primarily aquatic nature. For all we know, they may have vast underwater cities beneath the waves. On land they form stopover settlements from local materials, bringing with them resources, food, weapons, and a surprising panoply of domesticated creatures from their ocean home. In their defense, the Hadolid propensity for violence and isolation may be understandable. They are ancient enemies of the Sload, and whole campaigns from the two are said to take place on the seabed floor.\nFauns, meanwhile, are local to the Systres. They fill an ecological niche similar to Goblins back on mainland &lt;a href=\"Tamriel\"&gt;Tamriel&lt;/a&gt; and are about as charming and welcoming as those famously murderous and ill-tempered beings. Just why the Fauns reject other cultures with such violence is hard to say. But just as study into &lt;a href=\"Goblin\"&gt;Goblin&lt;/a&gt; culture has been in fits and starts because of a propensity for the subjects to kill the researchers, an understanding of Faun dialect and tradition is sadly lacking.\nDo the druids of High Isle have any kind of relation to the wyrds in &lt;a href=\"Glenumbra\"&gt;Glenumbra&lt;/a&gt;, such as the &lt;a href=\"Beldama%20Wyrd\"&gt;Beldama Wyrd&lt;/a&gt;?\n\u2014Nightlord\nA perfectly reasonable question, my dear, and one I had myself before I was able to speak to a few representatives of the True Way here on High Isle. In short, yes. The wyrd and the druids are branches from the same tree (so to speak). They both stem from ancient people living in the woods and moors of High Rock long, long ago.\nThe difference in their faith and function is cultural. And I apologize in advance, as the druids I spoke to were perhaps less politic than they might have been in describing this split. From the Stonelore point of view, the wyrd choose to live as \"half-men,\" to essentially prostrate themselves before nature and do its bidding. Some druids, it seems, see the wyrd as little more than children, playing a grand game of make-believe.\nIn contrast, the druids of the Stonelore, Eldertide, and Firesong circles are guardians and champions of nature. They steward the growth of forests and defend ancient sites of power from the cruel influence of civilization. Each of the three circles, in turn, have their own viewpoint of how best to accomplish this goal.\nHow does being fully surrounded geographically by sea (instead of land) affect the local Breton's (and general High Isle population's) culture in comparison to other High Rock areas such as Glenumbra, &lt;a href=\"Stormhaven\"&gt;Stormhaven&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Rivenspire\"&gt;Rivenspire&lt;/a&gt;?\n\u2014Cerulione\nIn many ways, you'll see some of the same sights and sounds here in &lt;a href=\"Gonfalon%20Bay\"&gt;Gonfalon Bay&lt;/a&gt; as in &lt;a href=\"Wayrest\"&gt;Wayrest&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Evermore\"&gt;Evermore&lt;/a&gt;, or any of the large cities back on the mainland. You can buy &lt;a href=\"sweetroll\"&gt;sweetroll&lt;/a&gt;s by the dozen, drown your sorrows with cheap grog, and pay a bard for a stirring rendition of \"Three Hearts as One.\" The biggest differences you're likely to encounter are cultural influences from a roaring maritime trade, the pageantry of the knightly orders, and the wellspring of the druidic faith.\nFor example, every few weeks the locals here in Gonfalon Bay celebrate something they call \"Angler's Day.\" It's an informal holiday to &lt;a href=\"Kynareth\"&gt;Kynareth&lt;/a&gt;, a local patron of sailors and fisherfolk. Taverns sell fish-based dishes at a discounted price, and anglers find themselves drinking for free wherever they choose to hang their hat for the night. Sailor-talk has ended up as common turns of phrase in the local language as well. If someone calls you to show up somewhere \"on the bell,\" for example, they're telling you to arrive on time. Someone might call you a \"tar-grip,\" which means they think you're reliable\u2014perhaps even a friend!\nDruidic words have also made their way into the local parlance, though fewer and farther between. If someone calls you a \"sandpiper,\" it's a sort of derogatory term for \"a person from off the isles.\" The druidic word for welcome, \"Vailten\" (pronounced VAL-chen) might escape from a few lips now and again. And if someone stubs their toe and shouts \"Draigh,\" (pronounced \"DRAYG\") well, that's a sort of impolite curse fancied up by a lovely druid word.\nWhat other foods do the Bretons of High Isle eat apart from crabs\u2014and possibly sunflower seeds?\n\u2014Santie Paws\nHahaha, a fine question, Santie. Since my retirement, I have enjoyed cuisine from my old home in High Rock to the very tip of the &lt;a href=\"Elsweyr\"&gt;Elsweyr&lt;/a&gt; sands. And by the &lt;a href=\"Eight%20Divines\"&gt;Eight&lt;/a&gt; do these people know how to cook, especially if you like seafood.\nIf you have the honor of sitting down at a noble's table, you'll be treated to glorious luxuries like Hundred-Year Bisque, Parrot and Pumpkin Salad, and Grilled Sweet and Sour Sea Adder. In a tavern, especially on Angler's Day, you'll have a wide variety of simple, filling options like Breton Bubble-and-Squeak, Apple Baked Fish, chowders (including fish, clams, shrimp), all varieties of seafood, and my personal favorite: mudcrab fries. Delicious!\nMy sister travels more than I and regales me with most ridiculous tales. After returning from Wayrest, she spoke of Breton betrothals. This one understands the concept of marriage for political gain, alliances that benefit all, but my sister also speaks of nobles who instead keep the family \"strong\" and \"pure\" by marrying each other. Ziss'vo, surely she jests?! I ask in strict confidence, because I wish not to offend in my upcoming journey to the Systres.\n\u2014Sugars-her-Milk\nSugars, it may be the brandy or the fact that I've been at this for a few hours but this question. Is. Exciting. I could share with you many, many, many stories. There was, in particular, a sordid party at &lt;a href=\"Castle%20Ravenwatch\"&gt;Castle Ravenwatch&lt;/a&gt; about ten years ago where a certain young noblewoman and her brother\u2014but I digress.\nIs this salacious rumor rooted in reality? To a degree. Certainly in ages past, the nobility of High Rock entertained notions that we in modern times would find most peculiar. For example, a historian I once traveled with loved to amuse me with stories of pagan rituals in the high country beyond &lt;a href=\"Kerbol%27s%20Hollow\"&gt;Kerbol's Hollow&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;a href=\"Bangkorai\"&gt;Bangkorai&lt;/a&gt; region. But much like this man's stories of paint-slick bodies and mind-altering concoctions, \"blood purity\" customs make for excellent tales around the campfire and very poor grist for a respected historian.\nFor a more recent, specific example you need look no further than the so-called \"&lt;a href=\"King%20Ranser%27s%20War\"&gt;Ranser's War&lt;/a&gt;.\" In the wake of the ill-advised uprising led by &lt;a href=\"King%20Ranser\"&gt;King Ranser&lt;/a&gt;, rumors spread from every tavern along the Stormhaven high road that the now-defeated upstart had been keeping company with every sibling in the royal line. His daughter Rayelle, the fulcrum upon which the conflict itself had started, was likewise rumored to be the result of one of these genealogically complex couplings.\nNonsense, all of it. But it makes for a good tale over a tankard of ale and so, much like the rumor your sister passed along, you will hear stories of \"pure blood\" relationships arise every few years. I suggest you listen to them with the proverbial pile of salt at your fingertips. But thank you for asking!\nAnd with that my friends, I believe I shall call it a night. My glass has grown empty, and the fire has gone cold. I imagine I will have a full day tomorrow working beside Lord Bacaro\u2014many preparations to make yet.\nI wish you all a fine eve, with fondest hopes this has been as entertaining to read as it has been to write."}

This entry was &lt;a href=\"https%3A//www.elderscrollsonline.com/en-us/news/post/57167\"&gt;published&lt;/a&gt; on 11/01/2019.\nContents.\nGreetings, fellow scholars! I hereby call this lecture to order. I hope you'll forgive any outbursts of scholarly enthusiasm. It's just that I've waited ever-so-long to assemble this gathering of like-minded academics. You are all most welcome, and I will endeavor to provide detailed answers to your every inquiry! Perhaps an introduction to start?\nMy name is Camilla Calsivius\u2014arcane naturalist in residence for the &lt;a href=\"University%20of%20Gwylim\"&gt;University of Gwylim&lt;/a&gt;. I'm also a member of the newly established &lt;a href=\"Dragonguard\"&gt;Dragonguard&lt;/a&gt;! Or should I say reestablished? Honestly, it hardly matters.\nWhile I have the utmost respect for the famed swordsman, &lt;a href=\"Sai%20Sahan%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Sai Sahan&lt;/a&gt;, the army he's assembled strikes me as\u2026 unconventional. To put it mildly. Now, I'm no warrior; and even if I were, I would be loath to assault such majestic creatures as Dragons. But, spending time with the Dragonguard has provided ample opportunity to study the creatures up close. I offer modest support for the Dragonguard\u2019s research, and in turn, they allow me to accompany them on their hunts. I can scarcely believe my luck!\nNow, I suppose that's enough about me. Let's start this conversation in earnest. Who's first?\n\"What prompted &lt;a href=\"Kaalgrontiid%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Kaalgrontiid&lt;/a&gt; to split off from the bulk of the Dragons in the Northern Lands, if they were originally part of &lt;a href=\"Alduin\"&gt;Alduin&lt;/a&gt;'s kingdom?\"\nAn excellent question! Let me begin by admitting that I've never spoken with Kaalgrontiid, so I can offer little more than supposition. As I'm sure you already know, Dragons are conquerors by nature. All my research indicates that this thirst for domination is not unlike our thirst for water in a desert. They need to bring the world to heel. This drive to rule may have prompted Kaalgrontiid\u2019s abandonment of the north.\nPersonally, I would take the assertion that a literal world-eating Alduin reigned over Skyrim with a grain of salt. Nonetheless, Dragons do reliably fall into natural hierarchies. In all likelihood, one Dragon reigned over all the others\u2014a king of kings. Was this supreme Dragon the legendary Alduin? Perhaps. Perhaps not. In either case, a Dragon as proud and powerful as Kaalgrontiid would likely chafe against this chief Dragon\u2019s hegemony. How can one conquer what already belongs to one\u2019s elder brother? I believe pride and ambition drove him to leave.\nAlso, Elsweyr strikes me as a far greater prize than Skyrim. Which would you rather rule? Pristine jungles and dizzying plateaus peopled by one of Tamriel's elder races, or a frozen wasteland inhabited by mead-guzzling barbarians? I'd choose the former, personally. No offense intended to any Nords in the audience!\nIt surprises me that there are no known notable Draconic constructions, given the might of such beings. Was their civilization truly so simple as to perch on hills and mountains all day, as is told in stories, or might they have created great constructs which have been long lost to us?\nA \"simple\" culture? My word, I hope you never say that when a Dragon sails within earshot!\nI would answer that question in three ways. First, some scholars do contend that Dragons \"built\" structures and \"smithed\" weapons in ancient times. These theories strike me as totally absurd, but I suppose anything is possible in the churning, timeless times of ancient antiquity.\nSecond, what self-respecting ruler builds their own monuments? Do you really think that the Na-Totambu kings took up the pick and spade to build the stone wonders of Hammerfell? Or that Vivec swings a hammer in that gaudy city he's building? Certainly not! That's what a loyal workforce is for. The Dragons ruled over countless thousands through their proxies in their Dragon Cults. Better to let the mortals toil in the stone and mud, right?\nFinally, you must recall how profoundly old the Dragons are, and how quaint the labors of mortals must seem to them. Just try to imagine: Dragons sailed over the face of Nirn before \"time\" had any meaning at all. They witnessed the birth of all that is. Where you see \"hills and mountains,\" Dragons likely see the majestic, exposed bones of creation itself! Can we honestly claim that an ancient castle is somehow superior to the sublime majesty of Tamriel's highest peaks? Perhaps you can, but I certainly can't!\n\"Naharanji has found what are obviously Dragon eggs in her travels. What is the proper way to care for them such they grow into a financially lucrative opportunity? Obviously nurturing these eggs such that they become young and ferocious would be ideal, but as others have mentioned, one never sees these juveniles in the wild.\"\nMay I? Oh dear. Yes, well\u2026. Naharanji, what you have here appear to be wamasu eggs. It's an easy mistake to make. I guess. I'm certain you can find a buyer somewhere. Perhaps in the \"markets\" beneath Senchal?\nIf any other attendees brought \"Dragon eggs\" with them, I'd kindly ask that you place them outdoors. Dragons do not lay eggs. I'm sorry if that comes as a surprise to anyone. Mara's mercy\u2026.\n\"The skeletal remains of &lt;a href=\"Thurvokun\"&gt;Thurvokun&lt;/a&gt; were recently reanimated in the mines of &lt;a href=\"Fang%20Lair%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Fang Lair&lt;/a&gt; by the foul &lt;a href=\"Blackmarrow%20Cult\"&gt;Blackmarrow Cult&lt;/a&gt;, his ancient bones used as a vessel for the soul of their leader. Does this imply that Thurvokun's own soul was devoured by a fellow dov at some point in the past, or could he rise again?\u2013Legoless\"\nOh, thank the Eight. A real question!\nThe persistence of Dragons' souls remains a matter of intense debate. All my research indicates that the soul of a Dragon persists eternally unless consumed. So, on that point, we are in agreement. As for this Thurvokun you mentioned, I can't say for certain. I've never crossed paths with one of these Blackmarrow rascals, and I hope I never do!\nHonestly, I find it extremely hard to believe that a mortal necromancer could manipulate a Dragon's soul, but it does invite some fascinating hypotheticals. For instance, if someone managed to pry a Dragon's soul from its mortal remains, where would that soul go? The particulars of soul magic are regrettably outside my area of expertise, but it seems to me that the link between a Dragon's soul and its physical remains is far stronger than that of a mortal. Flesh and bone make up a Dragon's form, but given their cosmic parentage, can we really compare that flesh and bone to our own? I strongly suspect that a Dragon soul, sheared from its remains, would either dissolve over time like cream poured into the ocean, or return to its point of origin\u2014Akatosh himself. In either case, resurrection (as we understand it) would prove impossible. Reanimation, however, remains a horrifying possibility.\nIn summary, the classical binary of soul and body that we rely upon to explain life on Nirn just might not be broad enough to explain that relationship in Dragons. We may need to develop an entirely different vocabulary to articulate it.\n\"Are there such a things as modern-era Dragons that aren't wholly interested in death, domination and\u2026 well, fire?\u2013Vivyer\"\nWell\u2026 no, to be perfectly frank. Dragons do occasionally find common cause with mortals. The red giant, &lt;a href=\"Nahfahlaar\"&gt;Nahfahlaar&lt;/a&gt;, for instance. I've even heard rumors of a Dragon \"monk\" who dwells among those Nord ascetics on the &lt;a href=\"Throat%20of%20the%20World\"&gt;Throat of the World&lt;/a&gt;. But even these exceptional Dragons cannot escape their intrinsic nature. At least I don't think they can.\nAgain, we must remember that Dragons dwarf us in more than simple size and strength. Dragons are older and more primordial than the mountains they dwell upon. The forces that drive a Dragon cleave closer to natural laws than the simple whims of mortals. Waves crash. Moons wax and wane. Dragons conquer and rule. I'm afraid it's as simple as that. Bad news for us mortals, but an astounding feature of the world at large!\nNow, I'm afraid that's all we have time for. I do hope this has been an enjoyable and enlightening lecture for all of you. Perhaps we can gather again soon. Farewell, my friends!\nOh, and Naharanji\u2026 please collect those eggs on your way out.\nA big thank you to everyone who submitted their questions to our venerable Loremaster.

Greatest mage of our era, master of extra-planar travel, renowned scholar of Daedric artifacts, and generous patron to the &lt;a href=\"University%20of%20Gwylim\"&gt;University of Gwylim&lt;/a&gt;. I have been asked as part of the University\u2019s ongoing series to provide you\u2013the layperson\u2013with knowledge about the wider world. If you are reading this, it is my assumption you have wits enough to understand the import of my words. Settle yourself and attend.\nThe subject in discussion today is the great &lt;a href=\"House%20Telvanni%20%28Online%29\"&gt;House Telvanni&lt;/a&gt;. In truth I imagine I was the only individual of any import who deigned to respond to the submitted questions. Take my words as truth, or don\u2019t. It matters very little to me.\nMy only goal in responding to these inquiries is to somewhat lift the veil of secrecy on the greatest of the &lt;a href=\"Great%20Houses\"&gt;Great Houses&lt;/a&gt; of Morrowind. To prove beyond a shadow of a doubt the primacy, power, and position in the world. House Telvanni stands alone. If you learn nothing else here today, learn that.\nHas House Telvanni always controlled the area surrounding &lt;a href=\"Necrom%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Necrom&lt;/a&gt;, or has that land changed hands multiple times throughout history? I get the impression the political map of Morrowind is always shifting, with the different Dunmer houses enforcing ancestral claims, purchasing or inheriting land, and finding many ways to manipulate their way to the top. What's the history of this so-called &lt;a href=\"Telvanni%20Peninsula\"&gt;\"Telvanni\" Peninsula&lt;/a&gt;, in that regard?\n\u2014Ash-of-Singing-Flame, Historian\nIn reviewing the submitted questions, this issue of geography and politics seemed paramount in importance. It arose in several questions, in various ways. Let\u2019s deal with this directly.\nMaps are tools. Nothing more. Nothing less. Standing in the &lt;a href=\"Ashlands%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Ashlands&lt;/a&gt;, a wayfinding map is a tool of survival. Able to assist you in finding your way to safety. Similarly, a ship\u2019s map may aid a sailor in finding a calm harbor far from home.\nBut political maps? Maps that claim to represent the truth of land claimed by force of blade and spell? These maps aren\u2019t tools for the reader. They\u2019re tools for the mapmakers.\nThey speak of great strength when perhaps none exists. They speak of boundaries and borders that may exist only in the minds of people burdened by over-heavy crowns. To offer a contemporary example, have you ever seen a map of \u201cthe front\u201d in the &lt;a href=\"Alliance%20War\"&gt;war between the three alliances&lt;/a&gt;? Do you believe that map was accurate for more than a day? At most? And, as always, remember that every written thing you read is subjective. Even the words of Divath Fyr.\nThis is all context. With that in place, the historian\u2019s question is easily answered. The Great Houses have skirmished to claim the length and breadth of the peninsula in the same way they have warred for control of &lt;a href=\"Vvardenfell%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Vvardenfell&lt;/a&gt;, or &lt;a href=\"Stonefalls%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Stonefalls&lt;/a&gt;, or &lt;a href=\"Deshaan%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Deshaan&lt;/a&gt;. Any maps that claim to fully represent political control of a region as heavily contested as Morrowind are guidelines at best. Even today, as the Three Banners war rages, my people continue their great game of strike and counterstrike. Gloved hands grip gilded blades, as the strong vie to rule the weak.\nAll that said, I would be remiss in not issuing a firm and clear warning. Anyone claiming that the great House Telvanni is not master of its domain is sorely mistaken. It is called \u201cthe Telvanni Peninsula,\u201d for the house controls the whole of the territory from its base to its tip, crowned by the island palace of &lt;a href=\"Port%20Telvannis\"&gt;Port Telvannis&lt;/a&gt; beyond. The city of Necrom, of course, is a somewhat complicated subject which I will address anon.\nBut if you have reason to fear the great house, do not sail for &lt;a href=\"Firewatch\"&gt;Firewatch&lt;/a&gt;. Stay far from &lt;a href=\"Gorne\"&gt;Gorne&lt;/a&gt;. House Telvanni\u2019s rule within these borders is undisputed. And its reach, its power, its vengeance is a terrible thing to behold.\nWhy [are] there quite a few Telvanni using the magister title? As the Telvanni title of magister is when you announce you deserve to be archmagister over the current one and there's quite a few Telvanni being called magister like \u2026 &lt;a href=\"Mistress%20Dratha%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Dratha&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Magister%20Therana%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Therana&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Magister%20Gothren%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Gothren&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Magister%20Shelreni%20Baro\"&gt;Shelreni Baro&lt;/a&gt; (in the Telvanni Peninsula).\n\u2014Gaius Sulla, Battlemage of the Thirteenth Legion\nAn understandable confusion. Titles in House Telvanni are not inherited. They are not granted, bequeathed, bought, sold, or traded. They are earned. They are taken. And if you do not have the strength, the will, the political acumen to hold that title. Well. There is always another eager house member behind you waiting to claim what is rightfully theirs.\nWhile in the past, claiming the title magister could be seen as a threat (that gilded blade, again), Archmagister &lt;a href=\"Nelos%20Otheri\"&gt;Nelos Otheri&lt;/a&gt; has actually encouraged the greatest of the house to take on this title if they think they can defend it. Otheri\u2019s hand is a steady one upon the great ship that is Telvanni. In this age of three alliances, the great mages of the house have little interest in the ponderous work of politics that the archmagister title would necessitate. In truth Nelos, like all scholars, wishes to be left alone to accomplish his own studies.\nFurther complicating this is the reality that beneath the Telvanni Council proper a number of ad-hoc conclaves and assemblies form, regionally, as required. Nothing in the great house can be accomplished without furious debate, after all. And, if needs be, a bit of fire and brimstone to clarify any contentious points.\nIn short, the magisters are a dangerous, self-selecting nest of snakes that greatly enjoy their station and power. And, nominally, make ready to put forth a new leader should the need arise.\nA nest of snakes, I might add, I have no interest in joining. Am I making myself plainly heard, Shelreni Baro?\nTwo Telvanni walk into a corner club. Are they allowed to stay, or do they get kicked out?\n\u2014Elsonso\nThe traditional answer to this joke inside the great house is \u201cThey stay. They buy the building, everyone inside, and work the loudest of the lot to death.\u201d I think it\u2019s rather quite funny.\nIt is something of an open secret that there are a great number of downright heretical members of House Telvanni who spurn the &lt;a href=\"Tribunal%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Tribunal&lt;/a&gt;. How does the house keep themselves from the ire of the &lt;a href=\"Ordinator%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Ordinator&lt;/a&gt;s?\n\u2014AltmerGF\nHeresy is in the eye of the beholder. Do you think the &lt;a href=\"Vivec%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Master of Morrowind&lt;/a&gt; is kept awake at night by the thought members of House Telvanni do not worship at his feet? In truth, the Ordinators are welcome within Telvanni lands, as long as they are on official business. No one can truly know the mind of a god, not even one such as myself, but I believe the respect the great house has for the Tribunal is reciprocated.\nOr, to borrow a phrase I heard from my groundskeeper the other day: We tend our stalks and they tend theirs.\nHonor to your house, Ser. A week ago, I met a mage of your house from Sadrith Mora who rode one of the strangest beasts I've ever seen. It looked like a horse, those mammals from the west, but it was made from spores and fungi, and as much as that is puzzling itself, I'm curious why one would shape it after that instead of something belonging to our own great fauna such as &lt;a href=\"guar%20%28Online%29\"&gt;guar&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Nix-Ox%20%28Online%29\"&gt;nix-ox&lt;/a&gt; or a &lt;a href=\"silt%20hopper\"&gt;silt hopper&lt;/a&gt;?\n\u2014Redoran Naver Avelas\nOne of the privileges of being Archmagister is that you need not explain yourself. I was in the room when &lt;a href=\"Nelos%20Otheri\"&gt;Nelos&lt;/a&gt; himself outlined the specifications of this creature to his coterie of &lt;a href=\"Mycoturgy\"&gt;mycoturges&lt;/a&gt;\u2013the best in Morrowind. Based on my limited knowledge of the Archmagister\u2019s past, I would hazard he took a liking to the horse during one of his sojourns to &lt;a href=\"Wayrest%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Wayrest&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Sentinel%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Sentinel&lt;/a&gt;, or &lt;a href=\"High%20Isle\"&gt;High Isle&lt;/a&gt;.\nAs an aside, I have never met a person who more enjoyed Twenty-Four Raven pie. His ability to dismantle a whole serving with merely his fingers and a fork speaks to an impressive understanding of transfiguration magics.\nWith Necrom being one of the holiest cities in Morrowind \u2026 where is the presence of &lt;a href=\"House%20Indoril%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Indoril&lt;/a&gt; said to closely be tied to the Temple and therefore Necrom? Has the land around Necrom always been Telvanni or has it passed hands over the centuries?\n\u2014Axmalexia\nAn excellent question, and an amusing name. We have already discussed the quixotic nature of political control in the region. I will not rehash that subject. But Necrom is a unique situation worth elaborating on. As part of the great House Telvanni\u2019s choice to reject the &lt;a href=\"Ebonheart%20Pact\"&gt;Ebonheart Pact&lt;/a&gt; (a choice I was consulted on, naturally), the issue of Necrom was immediately dealt with.\nNecrom has stood as the spiritual heart of regional ancestor worship since before the houses were formed. It has been claimed in campaign after campaign over the centuries, a worthy prize to any that could hold it. The Council understood that the new reality of House Telvanni\u2019s extraterritoriality would not withstand the cultural need for my people to visit their honored dead. And so one of the first sessions arranged between the barristers of the Pact and the barristers of the great house was dedicated to Necrom\u2019s nominal independence.\nNecrom is held in trust by the &lt;a href=\"Keepers%20of%20the%20Dead\"&gt;Keepers of the Dead&lt;/a&gt;, the vigilant attendants to the city and the Necropolis beneath. Any who wish to honor their ancestors are welcome there: be they Indoril, &lt;a href=\"House%20Redoran%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Redoran&lt;/a&gt;, or otherwise. The great House Telvanni recognizes the important cultural significance of the city, and it\u2019s with great pride that we ensure safe passage for any penitents seeking to reach the City of the Dead.\nI know that Dunmer inter their remains in ancestral family tombs, or in a city of the dead like Necrom, where they can later be summoned to communicate with their descendants. But do non-Dunmer people who, say ... got married into a Dunmer House, be also afforded these privileges, and also communicate with their descendants even though they are not Dunmer themselves?\n\u2014Benessa Gibby\nAh. A progressive. As with so many things in the Ashlands, the answer to this question depends on where and when you ask it. Traditionally, smaller communities maintain a hard-and-fast rule against non-Dark Elves being interred within family crypts. Larger cities like &lt;a href=\"Mournhold%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Mournhold&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"Ebonheart%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Ebonheart&lt;/a&gt; are more open-minded, but even in those cosmopolitan communities you\u2019re unlikely to find more than a handful of foreign names on the plaques beside a tomb. I\u2019m unfamiliar with how the Keepers of the Dead feel about such arrangements. But having had the displeasure of speaking with one of their Curates, who had the imaginative function of a particularly slow-witted guar, my guess is they\u2019re not thrilled.\nI support whatever choice a venerated family might make, of course. I\u2019d suggest asking ancestors directly what their opinion might be. After all, a prospective outlander addition to the family crypt is joining an august and revered congregation, one which might have strong feelings on the matter.\nI am curious as to the Telvanni traditions and ceremonies of the remains of members of the house. Do they differ from the practices of the other houses? What is the Telvanni belief if the remains of their dead are not interred properly? Are the spirits of their dead able to move on if their remains are intentionally held away from said tombs? I\u2019m just a curious, law-abiding Argonian.\n\u2014Not a &lt;a href=\"Shadowscales\"&gt;Shadowscale&lt;/a&gt;.\nHow droll. I will be speaking tersely with University editors about the propriety and framing of these questions going forward.\nThe great house sits in a position of primacy regarding Dark Elf funerary traditions. Some elders within the house claim that their observances predate the &lt;a href=\"Battle%20of%20Red%20Mountain\"&gt;Battle of Red Mountain&lt;/a&gt;, and in fact are a pure distillation of &lt;a href=\"Chimer%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Chimer&lt;/a&gt;ic ancestor worship with only slight adaptations for this modern era.\nYou need only look to the writings of &lt;a href=\"Saint%20Vorys\"&gt;Saint Vorys&lt;/a&gt; to see why House Telvanni understands that the proper veneration of the dead is a sacred charge.\n\"Justice is ephemeral. Duty is slavery. Trade and culture are ash in the bonfire of history. Binding yourself to these ephemeral concerns is false honor, false faith.\nThose who came before us gave all that they were to carve a path with their bones and their blood. Our ancestors demand we rise above temporal concerns to take power in our grasp. And continue the long march of destiny.\nYour prayers mean nothing. Your offerings mean nothing. It is the forceful expression of will that gives true honor to the Ancestors.\"\n\u2014Saint Vorys the Immolant\nA bit direct for my liking. But you cannot deny the truth in his words.\nThere are a series of tomes mentioned to be in the vaults of the city of Necrom called the &lt;a href=\"Indigo%20Scrolls\"&gt;Indigo Scrolls&lt;/a&gt;. Is there anything you can share on the knowledge contained within these tomes?\n\u2014Benefactor\nFor centuries, knowledge that the Indigo Tomes even existed was a closely held secret. Their offhanded mention by that imbecile &lt;a href=\"Headmaster%20Tanion\"&gt;Tanion&lt;/a&gt; in his has caused the Keepers of the Dead a small amount of grief, but as always the great house stands ready to assist Necrom with any security issues it might encounter.\nI would have ignored this question entirely, but an apprentice I\u2019m working with seeks veneration within the house by means of far-scrying divinatory magics. I thought it might prove an interesting challenge\u2013I am a harsh master but a fair one, and their failure would have resulted in only a minor punishment.\nHappily, they succeeded. I look forward to addressing your inquiry with a personal conversation. Please let this be a lesson that an unembellished pen name will not save you from House Telvanni.\nIf the original &lt;a href=\"vvardvark\"&gt;vvardvark&lt;/a&gt;s are collectively a failed result of a Telvanni experiment gone awry, what was the intended outcome? What chimeric disaster were they expecting to make?\n\u2014Zirili Fathryon\nIt is my understanding that &lt;a href=\"Magister%20Varkenel\"&gt;Magister Varkenel&lt;/a&gt; was attempting to create a kind of domesticated predator. Initial trials were aimed at using Ashlands stock to transfigure something similar to the small felines found in households across the western part of the continent. Further experimentation would have increased its size and ferocity in an effort to create a novel kind of warbeast.\nVarkenel\u2019s failure is no doubt one of the most successful accidents in the history of the great house. The Archmagister at the time gave the doting father the honor of expanding his experimentation to allow for a proper breeding program. And of course to expand the vvardvark line with additional colorations and configurations. I believe they have even developed large-scale beasts suitable for acting as pack animals or riding mounts, though I\u2019m unsure of where in the process that effort might be.\nThe Telvanni are known for their talented mages, and perhaps most powerful among them is Divayth Fyr, who is compared to the likes of &lt;a href=\"Shalidor\"&gt;Shalidor&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Vanus%20Galerion%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Vanus Galerion&lt;/a&gt;. Do you know of any figures from my Breton race that I can look up to that measure up to their power and/or accomplishments, perhaps even within Great House Telvanni?\n\u2014Lady Allene Ashcroft\nFirst and foremost, you have my compliments for choosing such an appreciative way to request this information, Lady Ashcroft. Your fellow question writers could have taken a page from your tome, contextualizing your true goals within the framework of charming obsequiousness. \nThe comparison to Arch-Mage Galerion is apt, but short-sighted. The Mages Guild is a halfway house for those with the mystical aptitude to slowly float a quill over a parchment, or light the lanterns in Wayrest with incantations a Dark Elf child masters before their tenth year. In short: lackwits. That a talent like Vanus Galerion has shackled himself to that sprawling edifice to mediocrity proves that wisdom is no requirement for arcane power.\nYour touchstone to Shalidor is more complimentary, but still flawed. The master of the &lt;a href=\"Labyrinthian%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Labyrinthian&lt;/a&gt; ultimately fell victim to short-sighted sentimentality. I do share agreement with some of his older writings about the role of spellcasters in civilized society, however. He also has the dubious distinction of owing me more outstanding favors than half of House Telvanni combined. I will eventually come to collect, old man. Count on it.\nYou Bretons have a reputation for mystical aptitude, but I would argue that the cost of that success has been a lack of lasting impact on the greater magical community. I could find numerous instances of Mage So-And-So making a splash with war magics for a few decades, and then dying. Or a great divinator prognosticating portentous events, and then dying. Breton mages burn brightly but briefly, I suppose, a sad commentary on the lifespan your uncaring gods have gifted your people.\nA gift, then, for you and the rest of your Covenant kin seeking validation in the wider world. Research Sage &lt;a href=\"Voernet\"&gt;Voernet&lt;/a&gt;, a scholar of the First Era who has come down to you as little more than a footnote but was a keen and masterful manipulator of the magical arts in his time. The adventures and prominence of the man known to history as \u201c&lt;a href=\"Gyron%20Vardengroet\"&gt;Gyron Vardengroet&lt;/a&gt;\u201d (that was not his true name) are vastly overblown by tale-telling, but speak to a powerful and wise Breton mage. And while I find the ethos of the &lt;a href=\"druids\"&gt;druid cult&lt;/a&gt; to be pedestrian in the extreme, the Druid King &lt;a href=\"Kasorayn\"&gt;Kasorayn&lt;/a&gt; was as powerful a spellweaver as any to be found in the Direnni culture his people fled from.\nThis will have to satisfy for now. Please direct any follow-up correspondence to the University in my care. Perhaps if you found this educational, another exchange might be possible again in the future.\nIf I can leave readers with a word of advice, it\u2019s this: I have lived for thousands of years without melancholy or misanthropy because I have always found something to engage my keen mind. Find hobbies. Engage your faculties. Stay curious.\nAnd never, ever cheat a Telvanni."}

I commend your bravery, if not your wisdom. Those who seek the knowledge of the Kyn can learn a great deal\u2026 but always at a price. Come then. Ask your questions. I will claim payment eventually. Count on it.\n\"I understand &lt;a href=\"Baron%20Zaudrus\"&gt;Baron Zaudrus&lt;/a&gt; took you captive within the mines of &lt;a href=\"Deshaan\"&gt;Deshaan&lt;/a&gt;. What manner of foul Daedra was this creature, and how could it so easily overpower the infamous Dread Lady?\nI have heard rumors of a fearsome Daedra that stalks the swamps of &lt;a href=\"Blackwood\"&gt;Blackwood&lt;/a&gt;. Firsthand sightings claim to have seen a &lt;a href=\"Ruinach\"&gt;Ruinach&lt;/a&gt;. What purpose would such a creature have for coming to Tamriel?\"\n\u2014Legoless\nLegoless. You again. Curse this vile spellcraft you employed to contact me. It has sent your cursed name to the top of my Oghma of Inevitable Retribution list, mortal. Still, the magic compels me to answer. To some extent.\nThe fool, \"Baron\" Zaudrus is a &lt;a href=\"Havocrel\"&gt;Havocrel&lt;/a&gt;. Like other Havocrels, he is nothing more than a sullen, hermitic lout. Unlike the &lt;a href=\"Kyn\"&gt;Kyn&lt;/a&gt;, his breed observe no bonds of clanship. They prefer to blunder from realm to realm in search of purpose. Zaudrus found his in service to &lt;a href=\"Mehrunes%20Dagon\"&gt;Mehrunes Dagon&lt;/a&gt;. Fitting, I suppose. But did he take me captive? I hadn't noticed.\nAs for the Ruinachs, they share the Havocrel's brutish strength but lack the giants' small measure of intellect. Like Dagon himself, they are prone to destructive tantrums. That business about Mournhold is nothing but inane bluster. As for their business in Blackwood, you'd have to ask them.\n\"I've heard rumors about &lt;a href=\"Meridia\"&gt;Meridia&lt;/a&gt;n Daedra describable as Auroran armor inhabited by beings of sentient light. Do you know what race these Daedra are?\nI've seen many kinds of armor and weapons made of ebony bound to Daedric souls, such as the set of armor in the Telvanni style worn by the famed &lt;a href=\"Divayth%20Fyr\"&gt;Divayth Fyr&lt;/a&gt;. What determines the aesthetics of Daedric armaments?\nWhat is the relationship between Mehrunes Dagon and &lt;a href=\"Hircine\"&gt;Hircine&lt;/a&gt; like?\"\n\u2014Aliyavana\nWhat manner of Daedra does the Glister Witch employ, you ask? One of little concern to the Kyn.\nYes, I know of the door-mage, Divayth Fyr. I assure you, his armor is only a pale reflection of true Daedric craft. Mortal mages often smuggle our plans and designs out of Oblivion with the intention of replicating them. A fool's errand, given Nirn's inferior materials. Fyr likely cobbled his pretender's panoply out of obsidian and bug-leather. When weighed against the genuine article, it is very poor armor indeed.\nAs for the relationship between Mehrunes Dagon and Hircine? There is no way to explain the accords of Princes to mortals. Your cheap dualisms of \"Friend\" and \"Foe\" cannot capture the sublime complexity of such associations. Hircine and Dagon do, of course, pursue parallel interests. The primacy of terror, the triumph of the will, the pursuit of bloody ends, and so on. Princes do, occasionally, act in concert. But they keep their own counsel on matters of this scale.\n\"&lt;a href=\"Xivkyn\"&gt;Xivkyn&lt;/a&gt; look down upon the Dremora, but what is the Xivkyn view on the &lt;a href=\"Xivilai\"&gt;Xivilai&lt;/a&gt;?\"\n\u2014Danel Vaden\nI do not often speak ill of &lt;a href=\"Molag%20Bal\"&gt;Molag Bal&lt;/a&gt;'s designs, but the phial-born Xivkyn are more trouble than they are worth. Yes, they view the Kyn as inferior\u2014a crude pretension that no doubt finds its origin in their Xivilai blood.\nFrom what I can ascertain, they despise the Xivilai for the same reasons we Dremora do\u2014their meritless pride, cheap cunning, and suspect loyalties.\nXivkyn do share our thirst for glory through order and discipline, so there's that at least. But as for the Xivilai? They can barely organize themselves into a straight line, let alone a cohesive fighting force.\n\"Why are there so many &lt;a href=\"banekin\"&gt;banekin&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"clannfear\"&gt;clannfear&lt;/a&gt; about, when their intelligence is admittedly far beneath a Dremora's?\"\n\u2014Fennwitty\nFor the same reason you mortals must endure rats and stinging fleshflies. There are simply too many to obliterate.\nThe feral multitudes of Oblivion do have their uses. The trick is to direct their fury in ways that prove advantageous in battle. Given their ferocious appetites and simple natures, this is quite easy to accomplish. Even your mortal sorcerers can bring them to heel from time to time.\nWeapons come in all shapes and sizes. A pack of clannfear can cause plenty of havoc in the right hands.\n\"Since we have last corresponded, the lack of understanding that mortals exhibit regarding the realms of Oblivion and their inhabitants has piqued my interest. In particular, I am quite intrigued with the idea behind Mehrunes Dagon's belief that &lt;a href=\"Nirn\"&gt;Nirn&lt;/a&gt; belongs to him. Would you kindly expand upon where this notion of Dagon's came from?\"\n\u2014Benefactor\nThis idea derives from the false assertion that Mundus is not distinct from Oblivion. That it is one of its constitutive realms\u2014a realm that conveniently belongs to Dagon. Tell me, have you heard Dagon himself make this claim? Or is this simply what one of his followers told you? Here is some immortal advice: pay less attention to idiotic cultists.\nMehrunes Dagon's association with Nirn is more metaphorical than existential. Metaphors possessed great power when things \"began.\" They still do in Oblivion. But in your spongey realm, they are simply tools for understanding. Revolution and destruction are straightforward concepts that correspond with mortals' limited understanding of the &lt;a href=\"Aurbis\"&gt;Aurbis&lt;/a&gt;. Dagon allows you to put a face on these terrifying elements of life on Nirn. Unlike the unknowable Princes like &lt;a href=\"Nocturnal\"&gt;Nocturnal&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Hermaeus%20Mora\"&gt;Hermaeus Mora&lt;/a&gt;, you can make Dagon's desires small and easily comprehended\u2014you can incorporate him into the shared myth of mortal significance. Why does Dagon believe Nirn belongs to him? A better question would be why do the people of Nirn believe Dagon belongs to them? Unsurprisingly, the answer is mortals' simple natures.\n\"I've found myself ... inspired by your Prince and his experimental Xivkyn. I'm pursuing similar research, to mix the best elements of Daedra and mortal. Specifically, Xivilai and Altmer, combining our unique traits, to create something ... unique. Please, share your views on likely avenues of success or failure and how much power I might require to achieve this.\"\n\u2014Auriella\nMerging a Xivilai with an Elf? Ambitious. But why shouldn't a pathetic wizard find success in the complex science of transliminal amalgamation? Honestly, why bother with the inanities of merging two divergent strains of Daedra like Molag Bal? That's child's play.\nWhy not summon a Xivilai and ask them to participate? Just be sure to avoid any binding incantations. You'll want their unfettered creativity to solve this puzzle. I eagerly await news of your success.\n\"You once noted that Daedra view mortals as mortals view the insects that crawl beneath our feet. Why, then, do you find any interest in us at all? I understand those who study an ant farm or observe a butterfly's metamorphosis, but what kind of mortal plays with a bug or takes pleasure in stomping on it but those who possess a child's emotional maturity?\nAnd what does that say about Daedric lords such as Dagon or Bal, who call us puny and yet expend such unusual effort into conquering our little sphere? I don't doubt our insignificance in the grand scheme of eternity, so why in Oblivion don't these literal gods mind their own realm of existence and stop making us sting them out like a colony of hornets?\"\n\u2014Palafico\nImmature? Need I remind you that even the most craven Varlet has witnessed the whole of mortal existence? The lowest Banekin has a more developed sense of the Aurbis's scale and nature than your most eminent scholars. Please consider the possibility that your narrow ontological framework\u2014and thus your petty \"moral\" imperatives\u2014are not as sturdy as you think. Nevertheless, though the magic wanes, I am still compelled to provide an answer. We Dremora do relish a challenge.\nI cannot speak for all Daedra, nor do I wish to. There are as many answers to this question as there are beings in Oblivion. I, however, admit some small measure of amusement through play. Despite its long catalogue of shortcomings, Mundus enjoys a degree of malleability that does not exist in the planes of Oblivion. Realms such as the Deadlands, Coldharbour, and Evergloam are fundamentally shaped and curated by the will of their respective Princes. The smaller realms\u2014infinite in both number and complexity\u2014often flex against the will to impose order over them, twist into hyperogonal paradoxes that resist even the most sophisticated ur-logic, or simply wink in and out of existence too quickly for us to find purchase upon their shores.\nMundus, however, submits to the predictable influence of the &lt;a href=\"et%27Ada\"&gt;et'Ada&lt;/a&gt;'s remains, but retains the stubborn caprice of the &lt;a href=\"Lorkhan\"&gt;Liar&lt;/a&gt;. That makes it \u2026 doughy. Flatten a mortal's vain little castle, and it remains flattened. But never for long. Soon, some other mortal with narrow aspirations builds another castle all on their own. I respect the lost et'Ada's foolish attempt at creation. It's tragic that they will never fully understand what a delightful playground they created for those of us who remain undiminished.\n\"When casting a bound spell, is it Oblivion's pure energy shaped into Daedric items, a conscious Daedra with that item's shape, or a conscious Daedra that was enchanted into that item and brought here? As all know, consciousness brings power and might. Do Daedra lose some of their strength and power when destroyed and reborn from the waters of Oblivion?\nRecently a friend of mine sent me a tiny sample of azure plasm from Coldharbour and told me all Daedra are born from it. Do all Daedric plasms have the same cold and bluish color?\"\n\u2014Nihilee\nGiven the laughable imprecision of mortal summoning rituals, there's really no telling what your weapons are made of. The manifest dynamism of Oblivion? Possibly. A sapient being from some pocket dimension of talking daggers? Perhaps. The &lt;a href=\"Foolkillers%20Clan\"&gt;Foolkillers&lt;/a&gt; once made war upon a minor realm peopled entirely by laughing mirrors, so who can say?\nThe substance you described is chaotic creatia. It has no inherent appearance. As many of your mortal scholars have noted, it takes forms appropriate for the realm it \"occupies.\" In Molag Bal's realm, the creatia takes the form of azure plasm. In Mehrunes Dagon's realm of the Deadlands, it appears (unsurprisingly) as quivering pools of lava.\n\"You yourself have gone through many trials and changes, both of home and of substance. While I suspect that your allegiance is simply to affect the change you desire, do you perhaps feel some kinship with Mehrunes Dagon, who may have gone through changes himself? Do you know anything of the process whereby Mehrunes was allegedly created by the &lt;a href=\"Magna%20Ge\"&gt;Magna Ge&lt;/a&gt;?\"\n\u2014Aramithius\nOnce again, you soft-headed mortals turn to the matter of Dagon's origins. Are the details of his genesis really so interesting? I sometimes forget what an outsized role \"birth\" plays in the minds of those who only recently experienced it.\nRather than pondering the stars' alleged role in Dagon's birth, you might consider their other failures. Is there anything so low as a Magna Ge? Say what you will about Mundus's creators\u2014at least they displayed conviction. What greater exercise of will exists than to die in pursuit of an impossible goal? But not the star-whelps and their cowardly sovereign. When matters turned dire, they simply fled! We will never know what might have been achieved had Magnus and his legions remained to finish their work. If they did have some hand in Dagon's emergence, is it any wonder that he embodies destruction?\n\"Are Daedra an extension of their Prince, choose to work with their Prince, or some combination of the two? This one hopes you can resolve a dispute on the matter.\"\n\u2014Ja'Khir the For Hire\nWhat a predictably mortal question.\nFew principles apply to all Daedra. We are as numerous and distinct as the grains of sand in your Alik'r desert. Some Daedra are shaped by the will of a Prince\u2014&lt;a href=\"Auroran\"&gt;Auroran&lt;/a&gt;s, Nocturnal's crows, and those bizarre mutants, the &lt;a href=\"dro-m%27Athra\"&gt;dro-m'Athra&lt;/a&gt;, for example. Others wander Oblivion eschewing any formal alliances with Daedric Princes\u2014notably the &lt;a href=\"atronach\"&gt;atronach&lt;/a&gt;s and countless morphotypes never beheld by mortal eyes. Most of the Daedra known to mortals fall somewhere in between. We Dremora pledge our allegiance to beings who display the greatest measure of will. In most cases, that means a Daedric Prince.\nAnd with that, our discourse is complete. One day I will claim my due. If you cannot provide what I demand, I will take something far dearer than your life. The Kyn always remember. And always collect.\nThank you to all our ESO lorehounds who took the time to ask such interesting questions, and although she remains generally apathetic to us mortals, we hope that Lyranth provided some satisfying answers. If you have some questions of your own related to lore and \"The Elder Scrolls Online\", why not put them to the community within the lore section of our official forums?

This entry was &lt;a href=\"https%3A//www.elderscrollsonline.com/en-us/news/post/63107\"&gt;published&lt;/a&gt; on 10/27/2023.\nContents.\nClear paths and warm days, friends. My name is &lt;a href=\"Druid%20Laurel\"&gt;Laurel&lt;/a&gt;, Druid of the &lt;a href=\"Stonelore%20Circle\"&gt;Stonelore Circle&lt;/a&gt;. It's not often followers of the &lt;a href=\"True%20Way\"&gt;True Way&lt;/a&gt; are able to address such an eager audience, to discuss our history and faith. I'm honored to have been chosen by the Archdruids to represent the epigones of the Stonelore, &lt;a href=\"Eldertide%20Circle\"&gt;Eldertide&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Firesong%20Circle\"&gt;Firesong&lt;/a&gt; circles.\nThe True Way is a promise we've made to the groves, to the seas, to the sky. It's not always an easy one to keep. Our devotion has been endangered more times than we can count. But we're still here, quietly tending to the Green in ways set down by our forebearers.\nI only hope my answers can cultivate your interest. Who knows, perhaps if the wind in the trees and the sun on your face call to you as they do to me, one day we may see you here in the heart of druiddom.\nWhat's the origin of the name &lt;a href=\"Galen\"&gt;Galen&lt;/a&gt;? Your ancestors referred to themselves as the Druids of Galen long before they even reached the &lt;a href=\"Systres\"&gt;Systres&lt;/a&gt; isle of Galen, according to the &lt;a href=\"Logbook%20of%20Druid%20Betrys\"&gt;Logbook of Druid Betrys&lt;/a&gt;. What is (or was) the original Galen?\n\u2014Analeah Oaksong\nBy far, this question is the one I saw more often than any other. I know that the time period before the druids left the lands of &lt;a href=\"Direnni\"&gt;Direnni&lt;/a&gt; is of great interest to students of history. I spoke with both &lt;a href=\"Trilam%20Heladren\"&gt;Trilam Heladren&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Varona%20Vedralu\"&gt;Varona Vedralu&lt;/a&gt; during their time in the archipelago, and it was at their suggestion I wrote \"&lt;a href=\"Exodus%20of%20the%20Druids\"&gt;Exodus of the Druids&lt;/a&gt;.\"\nWhat our visitors had trouble understanding, good Oaksong, is that my interest in the past is not academic. Not in the way it is for mainlanders. Understanding King &lt;a href=\"Kasorayn\"&gt;Kasorayn&lt;/a&gt; is a type of personal worship for me. I probably know more about our early past than any other follower on the island. It's a truism among druids that the now, the present, is the most important place to live. Which is a healthy point of view, I think, but tends to dissuade scholarly research.\nFriend, if it seems like I'm stalling, it's because I am. Because you're not going to like the answer I have to give you. I don't know where the name Galen comes from, and I believe that anyone that claims otherwise is telling you a falsehood.\nI can tell you a number of stories, though. Galen, it's said, was the name of a spirit that walked from the heart of the forest into the midst of an ancient proto-&lt;a href=\"Bretons%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Breton&lt;/a&gt; settlement. They were the one to sing the songs of &lt;a href=\"Y%27ffre\"&gt;Y'ffre&lt;/a&gt; to our ancient forebearers. They were the one to teach us the ways of the Green.\nOr, if you believe another tale, Galen was the name of the first Archdruid, the first Druid Queen. She was one of the very first &lt;a href=\"Nedes%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Nedes&lt;/a&gt; to channel the songs of the Singer, and rose to lead the first circle in the deep woods of &lt;a href=\"High%20Rock%20%28Online%29\"&gt;High Rock&lt;/a&gt;.\nOr, in yet another telling, Galen was the name of an island in a lake. A place of sacred worship where Y'ffre's heart could be felt beating even here in the realm of mortals. It was there, on that island, where our forebearers heard the songs and learned to tend the groves.\nWhich one is the truth? Honest-to-garden objective fact? I have no idea. And despite years of study and attempts to answer that question, I'm no closer today than I was the day I began to translate the ancient tablets. All we know for certain, today, is that the name holds a special place in the heart of my people. It is a name conveying solace, home and hearth, reverence and conservation. And so we are, and always will be, the Druids of Galen. Wherever our travels take us in the world.\nDo you believe druidism has a future on mainland &lt;a href=\"Tamriel\"&gt;Tamriel&lt;/a&gt;, perhaps among the wyrds of High Rock?\n\u2014Legoless, Tiger-Doyen of the United Explorers of Scholarly Pursuits\nWhat a fascinating question. I'd like to think so, yes. Recent events have given me the opportunity to get to know some of our mainland brethren. Surprising to no one who's studied our faith, there are many commonalities between the beliefs of our &lt;a href=\"Beldama%20Coven\"&gt;Beldama&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Glenmoril%20Wyrd%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Glenmoril&lt;/a&gt; sisters and our own. With the increase in travel to High Isle and Galen of late, I'd like to think our beliefs could find a voice of their own among you Tamsfolk. But that's a harvest for another year.\nI've heard some among the druid-folks have taken to shapeshifting to animals like those dire bears known as &lt;a href=\"ursauk\"&gt;ursauk&lt;/a&gt;s. I am curious how your arts differ from the Glenmoril Wyrd's shapeshifting - which is connected to the Stag Prince &lt;a href=\"Hircine%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Hircine&lt;/a&gt;.\n\u2014Tyrrosh of Clan Firewolf\nShape magic, the ability to temporarily wear the form of another living being, is a gift given to us by Y'ffre. A great divide exists between the followers of the True Way and the Wyresses of &lt;a href=\"Glenumbra%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Glenumbra&lt;/a&gt;, you see. The Wyresses look to the past, to the old gods of the ancient past and the beneficent mask of the \"Stag Prince.\"\nJust as the Druids have the clarity look beyond, to the wider world, so too do we have clarity in our belief. Y'ffre alone is the wellspring of our power. Just as a song or a tale can be reshaped, be revised and retold in the telling so too can a living being channel the strength of the Singer and find themselves a bird, or a buck, or a mighty bear.\nHow many Druids does it take to light a lamp post?\n\u2014Spartaxoxo\nOh, I've heard this one before. Ahem: \"At least three. One to light the lamp, one to plant a tree, and one to bore you with the tale of how nature gave us the gift of fire.\" I'd like to think my stories are anything but boring, by the by, but I understand the lore of the True Way is not for everyone.\nCan Druids predict the future?\n\u2014Maj'Thorax\nIn a way, yes. It is a very rare gift. The ability to subsume yourself so completely within the Green that you can see beyond tomorrow has only been granted to a few Archdruids over the years. King Kasorayn himself, of course, is the most well-known seer in druid history, and his \"&lt;a href=\"Dream%20of%20King%20Kasorayn\"&gt;Dream of King Kasorayn&lt;/a&gt;\" is an excellent example of what these predictions look like. It\u2019s an extensive metaphor, one that can be deciphered in a number of ways.\nThe songs sung by Y'ffre are very hard for the mortal mind to comprehend. And so we can only interpret, imagine, and hope that our seers learn what the Storyteller wants them to in these beautiful visions.\nThe reason for this letter was to see if you could help us clear up an issue that has been troubling the leaders of my guild, Aetherium Sankers. What could be the reason for the appearance of beings called \"&lt;a href=\"Chimera\"&gt;Chimera&lt;/a&gt;s\" on the island of Galen? Is it some plan of the Firesong Circle or is it something beyond our continental knowledge?\n\u2014Barsai Firepunch, Knight Errant of Magnus\nThe Chimeras are old magic, ancient even by the standards of the True Way. They are guardian beasts born of devotion and sacrifice to Y'ffre. &lt;a href=\"Blood%20magic\"&gt;Blood magic&lt;/a&gt; done in reverence to the Green is well known, if somewhat overdramatized, across Tamriel. But this is one area where I believe even the druids of the circle once spilled vitae on stone to see great workings done. You must understand, the followers of the True Way have almost been destroyed time and time again. Our earliest history is one of fear, repression, and a flight for freedom.\nWhen the early druids landed in the Sytres in their Singer-made craft, they still felt a great deal of fear. They did not know of the many trials that would follow, but how could they not desire some measure of safety after everything they'd been through? And so the Druid King and first &lt;a href=\"Draoife\"&gt;Draoife&lt;/a&gt; sang to the Storyteller to make an ancient tale into a reality.\nIn the here and now there are only a handful of the creatures left. Where once they stood against the enemies of the druids, now most of them can barely recall the endeavor to which they were born. If you have not read it, &lt;a href=\"Phrastus%20of%20Elinhir\"&gt;Phrastus of Elinhir&lt;/a&gt; has written an interesting piece on these magnificent creatures, showing an understanding deeper than some of my own order.\nI have been reading &lt;a href=\"Systres%20History\"&gt;Systres History&lt;/a&gt;, penned by Trilam Heladren. In his writings he references the ability of Systres druids to terraform even a volcanic island into something lush and rife with life. What are the extents of such an ability?\n\u2014Arwa at-Razia, Merchant Banker\nI greatly respect Heladren's writing, but you must understand that from his viewpoint much of Galen's past is frustratingly ahistorical. Researchers like Trilam and Varona want to study physical, traceable documents written by those who were there. And while some do exist, such as the diary of Druid Betrys, the history of my people is primarily an oral tradition. When you read Trilam\u2019s descriptions of druids magically singing boats and trees and food into existence, it's a mixture of fact and well-intentioned fiction.\nI believe, from some of our oldest tales, that our faith in the Singer did play a large part in our survival. But you have to remember that the earliest druids were also talented farmers, herders, sailors and scouts. When our faith is rooted, so to speak, in the power of nature it's easy to mistake knowledgeable crop-tenders for magic. If that's an unhelpful answer, you have my apologies. Blame the kelp-brained fools that recorded the history of our volcanic island on flammable materials.\nFrom time to time, this one cannot resist the temptation of scratching trees, &lt;a href=\"Spriggan%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Spriggan&lt;/a&gt;s included. This one looks at the trees fondly and is certain that all &lt;a href=\"Khajiit%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Khajiit&lt;/a&gt;i kin feel the same - that trees provide happiness and scratching. But this one is concerned: What do the trees really think? Do they appreciate the scratches?\n\u2014Sammy\nI feel both honored and a little flummoxed to find myself speaking on behalf of Tamriel's trees. I'll try to do the grove proud. It's a truth of nature that cats across the continent sharpen their claws on bark, and Y'ffre makes no mistakes. So if you find yourself deep in the green and feel the need to scratch that itch, I think you're fine. While that's true of trees in general, Spriggans are a people all their own.\nThe next time you find yourself near nature's guardians I would take the safest of all possible options and ask their permission before attempting to sink your claws in. While the Singer's patience is unending, some of their followers are inescapably mortal.\nI've prowled my way across High Rock, &lt;a href=\"Hammerfell%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Hammerfell&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Valenwood%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Valenwood&lt;/a&gt; and now, the Systres looking for the legendary &lt;a href=\"centaur\"&gt;centaur&lt;/a&gt;. Half-man, half-horse, should be some unique meat, right? Yet, despite all the stories, despite all the people in the cities telling me where I can hunt one, I've found nothing, not even a trace of their scent. Do centaurs even exist? Or are they some druid trickery to travel faster or something?\n\u2014Tsrak-ri\nI appreciate the spirit of your question, even if I'm not sure I agree with the dichotomy that you've established here. I feel like there's a middle ground here between \"centaurs do not exist\" and \"centaurs are a druid trick.\" I've never met a centaur, to be fair. Most of the stories I've read about half-man half-horse warriors have been purest (sometimes carnal) fiction. But some of the oldest stories handed down through the circles speak of centaurs as wise, spiritual people. A culture deeply in tune with the Singer's will.\nJust because we cannot touch or see a thing does not mean it does not exist. Faith is a funny thing, Tsrak-ri.\nWhat are your ties and knowledge of Archdruid &lt;a href=\"Devyric\"&gt;Devyric&lt;/a&gt;? What was he like before this &lt;a href=\"Earthen%20Root\"&gt;Earthen Root&lt;/a&gt; situation? What could have possibly changed him?\n\u2014OolongSnakeTea\nBlight take that man. My anger over the events at Earthen Root Enclave is still fresh, you understand. I\u2019m trying to tend the garden of my soul while assimilating the idea of our own raising a hand against us.\nThe Druid King was wise to split the faith in three, each of the circles brings a unique and beautiful viewpoint to the conclave of the Draoife. Before his turn, his corruption, Archdruid Devyric was a wise and vibrant man. A touch egotistical, but few rise to the level of Archdruid without being somewhat conceited. I hate what he became, but mourn his loss.\nI truly believe that Devyric does not represent the heart of the Firesong, an ancient and beautiful tradition. In these tumultuous days, a fiery defense of the natural world may be a viewpoint we could all benefit from.\nWith apologies for leaving you on something of a somber note, I think that will conclude our correspondence today. It\u2019s been a privilege to speak for the druids of Galen, to convey some small measure of our ancient faith to you.\nThe Storyteller teaches us that we should let stories grow within us, like a seed in fertile ground. Let these ideas grow within you, and share them again in turn. Green keep you, friends."}

It is later revealed that Lorgren was a &lt;a href=\"Necromancer%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;necromancer&lt;/a&gt; who experimented on his slaves and left their spirits to roam the house forever.\nLife and death.\nLittle is known about his earlier life, other than that he was member of the &lt;a href=\"Mages%20Guild%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;Mages Guild&lt;/a&gt; for a time. However, his studies of &lt;a href=\"necromancy\"&gt;necromancy&lt;/a&gt; and dark magic had him expelled from the guild and he was forced to continue his work in a secret chamber under his family home, &lt;a href=\"Benirus%20Manor\"&gt;Benirus Manor&lt;/a&gt;. Soon, simply theoretical experiments became boring and he turned to experimenting on living slaves, first of all to get an understanding of the soul, and later, to begin working out how to transform himself into that &lt;a href=\"Undead%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;undead&lt;/a&gt; specimen all necromancers one day hope to become: a &lt;a href=\"Lich%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;lich&lt;/a&gt;.\nHowever, as he was nearing his final transmutation, the &lt;a href=\"Anvil%20Mages%20Guild\"&gt;local Mages Guild&lt;/a&gt; got wind of what he was doing and stormed the house, led by &lt;a href=\"Carahil\"&gt;Carahil&lt;/a&gt;. They then killed Lorgren and sealed the portal to his laboratory. As he died, he cursed the house to be forever haunted by the tormented souls of his dead slaves, until one of his descendants opened the portal with their true Benirus blood and continued his work.\nSecond Death.\n&lt;a href=\"Where%20Spirits%20Have%20Lease\"&gt;Where Spirits Have Lease&lt;/a&gt;.\nTwo generations later, there was only one of his bloodline left \u2014 a man by the name of &lt;a href=\"Velwyn%20Benirus\"&gt;Velwyn Benirus&lt;/a&gt;. His dream was to leave Anvil and start a new life in Imperial City, but his family heritage forced him to clean up all the loose ends \u2014 including selling the manor. Unfortunately it had garnered a reputation as being a 'deathtrap' and any new buyers were scared off by rumors of vanishing mysteriously the first night they slept there. The Hero was one of these prospective buyers, but they were not as easily repelled.\nAfter discovering Lorgren's skeletal arm in a smashed jar, they tracked down Velwyn and convinced him to come to the manor and open the portal. Although he came, after fighting his way through and opening the portal, he fled in terror.\nThe Hero confronted Lorgren, but the lich backed down and said all he wanted was to be finally at rest. The Hero returned his arm, only to be attacked by Lorgren, now at full power. However, Lorgren's rebirth was to be a short one. He was struck down, and as his taint lifted from the house, so did its aura of the dead \u2014 flowers grew, all the furnishings were restored, and the house that had been a stain on the city of &lt;a href=\"Anvil%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;Anvil&lt;/a&gt; was cleansed.\nQuotes.\n\"I am Lorgren Benirus, and I desire the chance to atone for my sins. The things I've done to to the people of Anvil; the horrible, unspeakable acts I've committed demand repentance. Carahil was justified in his actions. Slaying me was the only way to stop the madness. I have accepted that fate. Now, so I may make my final peace with the Nine, please rejoin my hand to my body. Only then, when I am complete, will this eternal nightmare end.\"\nAfter rejoining the hand:\n\"It never fails to amuse me how easy mortal man is to manipulate. You've assisted me in in completing the very thing Carahil and his cabal sought to prevent all those years ago... my ascension to immortality.

However, &lt;a href=\"Heart%20of%20Lorkhan\"&gt;Lorkhaj's heart&lt;/a&gt; had been filled with the void, and he tricked his siblings and forced them to be in this new place Nirni had requested. Many of them died as a result.\nThe other children of Fadomai thus decided to punish Lorkhaj by ripping out his heart and hiding it in Nirni, and they cursed Lorkhaj to walk Nirni for many phases. Nirni, however, was able to forgive Lorkhaj as she could now bear children.\nSome time after this, Lorkhaj came to his sister &lt;a href=\"Azurah\"&gt;Azurah&lt;/a&gt; with a big hole in his chest where his heart had been. The void that had filled his chest beat like a normal heart, but it was filled with the darkness of the void. Azurah ripped the darkness out and cast it beyond the sea, where it became the Moon Beast, the first &lt;a href=\"Dro-m%27Athra\"&gt;Dro-m'Athra&lt;/a&gt;. Azurah then held Lorkhaj until he died.

His divine spark fell to Nirn as a shooting star \"to impregnate it with the measure of its existence and a reasonable amount of selfishness.\" Lorkhan's &lt;a href=\"Heart%20of%20Lorkan\"&gt;heart&lt;/a&gt; was indirectly responsible for at least three major near-disasters in the last decades of the &lt;a href=\"Third%20Era\"&gt;Third Era&lt;/a&gt;, and his remains are connected to the disappearance of the &lt;a href=\"Dwemer\"&gt;Dwemer&lt;/a&gt;. It is also believed by some that Nirn's moons, &lt;a href=\"Masser\"&gt;Masser&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Secunda\"&gt;Secunda&lt;/a&gt;, are the two halves of Lorkhan's \"flesh-divinity,\" cleaved in two. \nCreation.\nIt is said that Lorkhan was created by &lt;a href=\"Sithis\"&gt;Sithis&lt;/a&gt; to go and destroy the universe, after the &lt;a href=\"Aedra\"&gt;Aedra&lt;/a&gt; had enslaved everything Sithis had created. It is unknown whether this is true; some sources state that he simply originated as an Et'Ada formed of the primal urge to physically or metaphorically create.\nCreation of Mundus.\nIt is generally accepted that Lorkhan either tricked or persuaded many of his fellow et'Ada into investing some of their power into a project he called Mundus, the Mortal Plane.\nSome et'Ada invested more power into the project than others, however. These were the entities that would come to be known as the &lt;a href=\"Eight%20Divines\"&gt;Eight Divines&lt;/a&gt;. Those who could not or refused to participate were the et'Ada that would later come to be known by the Aldmer as the &lt;a href=\"Daedra\"&gt;Daedra&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe Mortal Plane was magically volatile, and the presence of the Aedra there both strengthened and weakened it. Once the project had been completed, &lt;a href=\"Magnus\"&gt;Magnus&lt;/a&gt;, the chief architect of the project began to have doubts. For this reason, the &lt;a href=\"Convention\"&gt;Convention&lt;/a&gt; was held at the &lt;a href=\"Direnni%20Tower\"&gt;Direnni Tower&lt;/a&gt;.\nAt this Convention, it was finally decided that Lorkhan was to be punished for his trickery in persuading the Aedra to create Mundus. His divine spark was removed and hurled towards Tamriel, and the Aedra departed to Aetherius.\nHistory.\nLorkhan is one of only two et'Ada (the other being &lt;a href=\"Akatosh\"&gt;Akatosh&lt;/a&gt;) to appear in every known mythology on Nirn. However, opinions of him vary dramatically from race to race. Generally speaking, Lorkhan is considered an enemy of the &lt;a href=\"mer\"&gt;mer&lt;/a&gt;, and a patron and hero to &lt;a href=\"men\"&gt;men&lt;/a&gt;. The &lt;a href=\"Cyrodilic\"&gt;Cyrodilic&lt;/a&gt; culture calls him Shezarr, The Missing God, reflecting the fact that he alone of the &lt;a href=\"Aedra\"&gt;Aedra&lt;/a&gt; has truly died and vanished.\nIn Mer mythology, Lorkhan is considered a trickster, and the Mer do not look kindly on him. They blame Lorkhan for tricking the other Aedra into giving up their divinity. The Dunmer have a slightly different view of Lorkhan. Since they believe that their mortality is a test of their strength, and that they are ultimately destined to shed their mortality, Lorkhan is simply one of the obstacles the Dunmer have to overcome.\nHowever, Men do not believe themselves to be descended from the Aedra. They believe themselves to be created from nothing by Lorkhan, and thus owe their entire existence to him. In their opinion, Lorkhan is the hero of mankind, and they object to his mistreatment by other races.\nLorkhan's Heart.\nEven more so than the &lt;a href=\"Amulet%20of%20Kings\"&gt;Amulet of Kings&lt;/a&gt;, the most influential legacy of Lorkhan's existence was his &lt;a href=\"Heart%20of%20Lorkhan\"&gt;Heart&lt;/a&gt;. Altmer legend details the anger the remaining Aedra had towards Lorkhan once Nirn had been created. As punishment, &lt;a href=\"Trinimac\"&gt;Trinimac&lt;/a&gt; tore out his heart, intending to destroy it. However, the Aedra were present on Nirn, and Nirn itself was the remnants of Lorkhan's body. Thus, his Heart was literally the Heart of the World, and could not be destroyed. Instead, &lt;a href=\"Auri-El\"&gt;Auri-El&lt;/a&gt; flung the heart down to Nirn, intending to bury it forever.\nThe Heart did not remain hidden, however. During the First Era, while excavating caverns under Red Mountain in &lt;a href=\"Morrowind\"&gt;Morrowind&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"Dwemer\"&gt;Dwemer&lt;/a&gt; located Lorkhan's Heart. &lt;a href=\"Kagrenac\"&gt;Kagrenac&lt;/a&gt; proceeded to build a huge mechanical being, a golem named &lt;a href=\"Numidium\"&gt;Numidium&lt;/a&gt;, which he intended to power with Lorkhan's Heart. Before he could do so, however, the &lt;a href=\"Chimer\"&gt;Chimer&lt;/a&gt; attacked the Dwemer, and the Dwemer disappeared during said battle, presumably due to Kagrenac tinkering with the heart. However, Numidium survived its creator's disappearance and would play a key role in many future events.\nThe first real use of Numidium came during the late Second Era, when it was loaned by &lt;a href=\"Vivec\"&gt;Vivec&lt;/a&gt; to &lt;a href=\"Tiber%20Septim\"&gt;Tiber Septim&lt;/a&gt; to aid in conquering Tamriel. At this point, however, Vivec and the Tribunal were keeping close control over the Heart of Lorkhan, so another power source was used for the golem (specifically, the Mantella, often mistaken for the soul of &lt;a href=\"Ysmir\"&gt;Ysmir&lt;/a&gt;). The golem would reappear late in the Third Era, hundreds of years later, as &lt;a href=\"Zurin%20Arctus\"&gt;Zurin Arctus&lt;/a&gt; reappeared as the &lt;a href=\"Underking\"&gt;Underking&lt;/a&gt; and destroyed the golem.\nThe final encounter with the Heart of Lorkhan came during the &lt;a href=\"Dagoth%20Ur%20%28Character%29\"&gt;Dagoth Ur&lt;/a&gt; crisis. It was here that the true power of the Heart was revealed, essentially validating many of Kagrenac's claims. After the defeat of the Dwemer, the Tribunal had used the Heart to achieve near-divine status. Contact with the Heart granted them immortality, at least as long as they maintained frequent contact. It also granted them legendary powers; such as Vivec's ability to flood all of Morrowind, and supposedly grant the entire Dunmer race the ability of &lt;a href=\"Water%20Breathing\"&gt;water breathing&lt;/a&gt; first, to fend off an invasion.\n&lt;a href=\"Indoril%20Nerevar\"&gt;Indoril Nerevar&lt;/a&gt; was the Chimer general responsible for the attack and ultimate defeat of the Dwemer at Red Mountain around the year &lt;a href=\"1E%20700\"&gt;1E 700&lt;/a&gt;. When the battle had concluded Nerevar ordered Dagoth Ur to remain behind and guard the Heart, as he and the &lt;a href=\"Tribunal\"&gt;Tribunal&lt;/a&gt; (then mortal Chimer) found a plan on what to do with the artifact. When they returned they found that Dagoth had become insane from tapping into the Heart's power. A battle broke out between Nerevar and the Tribunal against Dagoth Ur. Dagoth eventually lost the duel which ended with Nerevar being mortally wounded. This is where reports differ. One legend states that after finding the Tribunal and making them swear not to use the tools of Kagrenac on the Heart, the Tribunal murdered Nerevar. Another report simply says that Nerevar died after making them swear to Azura, after which they used the tools, against their oath, and became the living gods of Morrowind (the act that caused &lt;a href=\"Azura\"&gt;Azura&lt;/a&gt; to turn the Chimer race into the Dunmer). It was thousands of years later in the Third Era that the &lt;a href=\"Nerevarine\"&gt;Nerevarine&lt;/a&gt;, a reincarnation of Nerevar, was able to destroy the Heart, after the second rise of Dagoth Ur. This caused the Tribunal to lose their immortality as well, simply making them incredibly powerful mortals. After losing her immortality, &lt;a href=\"Almalexia\"&gt;Almalexia&lt;/a&gt; killed &lt;a href=\"Sotha%20Sil\"&gt;Sotha Sil&lt;/a&gt; and was, herself, killed by the Nerevarine. That event led to Vivec being the only member of the Tribunal alive during the Third Era and ended the influence that the Heart had on men and mer.\nVivec disappeared around the end of the Third Era during the &lt;a href=\"Oblivion%20Crisis\"&gt;Oblivion Crisis&lt;/a&gt; under mysterious circumstances. Though magical inventions were made to support &lt;a href=\"Baar%20Dau\"&gt;Baar Dau&lt;/a&gt; in Vivec's absence; the meteor eventually fell in &lt;a href=\"4E%205\"&gt;4E 5&lt;/a&gt;, resulting in the destruction of &lt;a href=\"Vivec%20City\"&gt;Vivec City&lt;/a&gt;, and another eruption of &lt;a href=\"Red%20Mountain\"&gt;Red Mountain&lt;/a&gt;.\nAlternative views.\n&lt;a href=\"Mankar%20Camoran%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;Mankar Camoran&lt;/a&gt; claims that Lorkhan created Tamriel, which was misnamed by \"deluded mortals.\" He says that the proper name is Dawn's Beauty, the Princedom of Lorkhan, and it is just one more Daedric realm of Oblivion.\nLorkhan and Sithis.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Dark%20Brotherhood\"&gt;Dark Brotherhood&lt;/a&gt; claims that Lorkhan was begotten by &lt;a href=\"Sithis\"&gt;Sithis&lt;/a&gt; in order to destroy the universe, a belief which notably ties in with how &lt;a href=\"Mer\"&gt;Mer&lt;/a&gt; cultures universally vilify Lorkhan as the \"Doom-Drum\". However, when the &lt;a href=\"Last%20Dragonborn\"&gt;Last Dragonborn&lt;/a&gt; enters into Lorkhan's domain of &lt;a href=\"Sovngarde%20%28Location%29\"&gt;Sovngarde&lt;/a&gt; and presents himself as &lt;a href=\"Listener\"&gt;Listener&lt;/a&gt; to the &lt;a href=\"Night%20Mother\"&gt;Night Mother&lt;/a&gt;, a position of highest honor in the eyes of Sithis, the ancient &lt;a href=\"Nord\"&gt;Nord&lt;/a&gt;ic god &lt;a href=\"Tsun\"&gt;Tsun&lt;/a&gt; proclaims defiantly: \"\"You trespass here, shadow-walker. &lt;a href=\"Shor\"&gt;Shor&lt;/a&gt; does not know you. Perhaps before the end you will earn the right to pass this way. Welcome I do not offer, but your &lt;a href=\"Dragonslayer\"&gt;errand&lt;/a&gt; I will not hinder, if my wrath you can withstand.\"\""}

Once the &lt;a href=\"Hero%20of%20Kvatch\"&gt;Hero&lt;/a&gt; have gone throughout this cave, continue to the Lost Boy Hidden Bastion.\nLost Boy Canyon.\nNothing too noteworthy here except for a one or two chests containing weak magic items, and necromancers. Although another \"Hidden Boy\" note is found here.\nLost Boy Hidden Bastion.\nSearch throughout the third level of the cave (overall easier to navigate). A desk with a red tapestry above it contains some interesting notes. Read the three\u00a0&lt;a href=\"Letters%20to%20the%20Guild%20of%20Mages\"&gt;Letters to the Guild of Mages&lt;/a&gt;. Each letter describes a &lt;a href=\"lich%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;lich&lt;/a&gt; named &lt;a href=\"Erandur-Vangaril\"&gt;Erandur-Vangaril&lt;/a&gt;.\nOn the desk is also some &lt;a href=\"Alchemy%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;alchemical&lt;/a&gt; tools. Afterwards, go towards the stairs near the desk and walk straight up, and continue until they enter a room with two sleeping slabs, and a stairway blocked by dirt with a chest under it. Kill the necromancers in the room, and continue towards the chest near the stairs. Inside the chest is a key and another note. Pick them both up, and search around the room for more chests.\nHead back down the stairs and enter the \"Old Wooden Door\" with an average lock; the key will open it. Inside the room the Hero will encounter two Skeleton Guardians and Erandur-Vangaril, a necromancer turned lich. Take the guardians out, but Vangaril won't attack, nor can the Hero attack him, unless they're at least level 23 when first entering the area. Head behind the chair and there is a chest with a note upon it. The chest has an 'average' lock level and cannot be opened with the key. Inside the chest is another note, and a level-dependent treasure."}

As far as anyone knows, we're shipping refugees, just one in a long line a vagrant caravans escaping the wrath of the &lt;a href=\"Red%20Mountain\"&gt;Red Mountain&lt;/a&gt;. Normally, a story like that would be enough to get us through, but not this time.\nNow I've been a caravan guard for some time, and I've seen some pretty extensive security measures. Locks, chains, the words. One client even had a conjurer summon a &lt;a href=\"Daedra\"&gt;Daedra&lt;/a&gt; to guard his wagon, but even compared to that, this seems excessive.\nFor one, everything has a code name. The cargo, the guards, even the horse. As for the caravans, to keep it familiar we've each been given a name from one of the &lt;a href=\"Great%20Houses\"&gt;Great Houses&lt;/a&gt;.\nOf course, some of the guards didn't like that part. One of the new bloods said he'd rather bend the knee to a &lt;a href=\"Guar%20%28Morrowind%29\"&gt;guar&lt;/a&gt; than wear the name of &lt;a href=\"House%20Dres\"&gt;House Dres&lt;/a&gt;. But Caption Inedos brought him in line with the point of his blade, and the rest soon followed. You'd think the &lt;a href=\"Red%20Year\"&gt;Red Year&lt;/a&gt; would unite us, but it seems like there's old scars that haven't healed and old scores that haven't been settled. But at the end of the day, none of that matters. The job's the job. Like the Captain said, at least they didn't name us after the boots.\nWe've also got some decoy caravans heading out through Skyrim, all the way to some undisclosed location in &lt;a href=\"Hammerfell\"&gt;Hammerfell&lt;/a&gt;. But since that's not enough, each caravan will meet up at preset checkpoints and swap their items out.\nThat means different decoys traveling different paths every step of the way. With the refugee garb they say we should blend right in, and on the off chance we don't, we've got runners set to flee to the next village, hidden compartments, anything you can think of.\nStill, if you ask me, all of it sounds like a waste of time. I'm no scholar, but those two bits of cargo don't look like anything special, just a fancy way to bash some poor f'lah's skull in.\nWith all the chaos bleeding out of &lt;a href=\"Vvardenfell\"&gt;Vvardenfell&lt;/a&gt;, we've made it to Windhelm without so much as a paper cut. Come morning we're heading out west along the river to the &lt;a href=\"Nightgate%20Inn\"&gt;Nightgate Inn&lt;/a&gt;. If all goes well we'll reach the mountain pass by midday. Still, we'd get there sooner if not for all the stops."}

From &lt;a href=\"Stendarr%27s%20Beacon\"&gt;Stendarr's Beacon&lt;/a&gt;, I could see the &lt;a href=\"Red%20Mountain\"&gt;Red Mountain&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"Vvardenfell%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Vvardenfell&lt;/a&gt;, but I never ventured there. Like many &lt;a href=\"Nords%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Nords&lt;/a&gt;, I was content to leave foreign lands to the foreigners.\nA scant ten years ago in &lt;a href=\"2E%20572\"&gt;2E 572&lt;/a&gt;, my father took a different path. He fought with our &lt;a href=\"Dunmer%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Dunmeri&lt;/a&gt; allies to repel the &lt;a href=\"Akaviri%20Invasions\"&gt;Second Akaviri invasion&lt;/a&gt;. As a soldier of Skyrim, he was there when the Nords pursued the invaders into &lt;a href=\"Stonefalls%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Stonefalls&lt;/a&gt;. He told me of an army on the brink of ruin, marching ever further into foreign territory, hungry and nearly broken, until the Dunmer brought in &lt;a href=\"Argonians%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Argonian&lt;/a&gt; troops to aid the Nords.\nNo one expected this. I still cannot believe it. The Dunmer once held the Argonians as slaves, yet on that day, the Argonians' arrival changed the course of history. From the jungles they came, adorned with blood and mud. &lt;a href=\"Akaviri\"&gt;Akaviri&lt;/a&gt; fell beneath their claws, as well as the swords and spells of their Nord and Dunmeri allies. An alliance was forged that day and has never faltered since.\nAgreements were signed in &lt;a href=\"Ebonheart%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Ebonheart&lt;/a&gt;, but these were formalities compared to the ties made on the battlefield. Our alliance was forged in the fires of adversity, a shield to protect us from all invaders. Our cultures differ but our aims bind us.\nA few years ago, the Dunmeri &lt;a href=\"Tribunal%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Tribunal&lt;/a&gt; called for more troops from our alliance, insisting that we take up arms against a new enemy: an &lt;a href=\"Reman%20Empire\"&gt;Empire&lt;/a&gt; growing in &lt;a href=\"Cyrodiil%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Cyrodiil&lt;/a&gt;. Our enemies in the &lt;a href=\"Daggerfall%20Covenant\"&gt;Covenant&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Aldmeri%20Dominion%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Dominion&lt;/a&gt; also sent troops to liberate this territory.\nAnd now? War rages across &lt;a href=\"Tamriel\"&gt;Tamriel&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href=\"Khajiit%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Khajiit&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Bosmer%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Bosmer&lt;/a&gt; war against Dunmer and Argonians. &lt;a href=\"Altmer%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Altmer&lt;/a&gt; strike against Skyrim. And from &lt;a href=\"High%20Rock%20%28Online%29\"&gt;High Rock&lt;/a&gt;, the Daggerfall Covenant attacks us all.\nIn the midst of such chaos, what choice do we have? Our alliance with the Dunmer and Argonians has stood for a decade. I have fought beside our allies in battle. And when I return home, I tell my children proud tales of victory over our foes, fighting with Dunmer and Argonians beside me.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Ebonheart%20Pact\"&gt;Pact&lt;/a&gt; never ceases to surprise me. I have spoken at great length with Argonian mystics, marveling at their view of the world.

She wanted me to take something she referred to as a lexicon back to Avanchnzel.\"\nWalkthrough.\nRiften Docks.\nThe Dragonborn will find From-Deepest-Fathoms wandering around &lt;a href=\"Riften%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Riften's&lt;/a&gt; docks. Upon first meeting her, she seems despondent and paranoid, immediately wanting to give the lexicon over to the Dragonborn, pleading for it to be returned to the &lt;a href=\"Dwemer%20ruins\"&gt;Dwemer ruins&lt;/a&gt; of Avanchnzel.\nAvanchnzel.\nUpon arriving at Avanchnzel, four transparent orange figures will be standing at the bottom of the first large open cave room. These are the \"ghosts\" of four adventurers (or \"thieves,\" in their own words, although none of them can pick a lock), who went to Avanchnzel to recover/steal the Lexicon.\nThey will reappear throughout the quest and the Dragonborn can overhear that the two human characters had little knowledge about the place or item of interest, but From-Deepest-Fathoms and &lt;a href=\"Watches-The-Roots\"&gt;Watches-The-Roots&lt;/a&gt; were very familiar with both and persuaded them to stay and complete the job against their better judgement. The two human mercenaries stay, only because the job paid well, but it becomes clear that the &lt;a href=\"Argonians%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Argonians&lt;/a&gt; sought out the Lexicon for the knowledge it housed.\nWhen following the marker along the corridors, the ghosts will reappear along the way. &lt;a href=\"Dwarven%20Spider%20Worker\"&gt;Dwarven Spider Worker&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"Dwarven%20Spider%20Guardian\"&gt;Dwarven Spider Guardian&lt;/a&gt;s and &lt;a href=\"Dwarven%20Sphere%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Dwarven spheres&lt;/a&gt; are found on the way.\nAvanchnzel Animoncultory.\nFight the &lt;a href=\"Animunculi\"&gt;Dwarven enemies&lt;/a&gt; and continue forward up the stairs and corridor, passing a tent with four &lt;a href=\"Rest%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;bed rolls&lt;/a&gt; used by the adventurers when alive.\nBeware of the trap when opening the door on the right in the next room. Continue through rooms and doors, eventually coming to a large room with two &lt;a href=\"Dwarven%20Centurion%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Dwarven centurions&lt;/a&gt; on large stone tables.\nIn the next room, one of the adventurers, &lt;a href=\"Drennen\"&gt;Drennen&lt;/a&gt;, is lying dead on the floor. He left the group for unknown reasons.\nAvanchnzel Boilery.\nUpon entering the boilery, the three remaining ghosts talk about the lexicon and what to do with it. Moving forward through rooms and corridors, the ghosts reappear before a door and they are in a hurry to reach the Receptacle. In the next room, there is the second dead explorer, Watches-The-Roots.\nFinally, through the last door, there is a large room with &lt;a href=\"Breya\"&gt;Breya&lt;/a&gt;, the last of the explorers, lying dead on the floor. A Dwarven Centurion is guarding the Receptacle in which to place the Lexicon. This Centurion can easily be defeated by luring it into the spinning blade trap in the last room.\nUpon activating the receptacle, the Lexicon will be removed from the inventory and open. The Dragonborn will be rewarded with &lt;a href=\"Ancient%20Knowledge%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Ancient Knowledge&lt;/a&gt;, a permanent bonus. The quest will now be completed.\nLeave by the door behind the Receptacle and go through the barred doors and out to the Avanchnzel Balcony for a faster exit and a locked chest with some loot.\nThis dungeon is not accessible before the quest has been activated (&lt;a href=\"Dungeon%20Lock%20Outs\"&gt;Dungeon Lock Outs&lt;/a&gt;)."}

Asking people around Skingrad will reveal that he is at the &lt;a href=\"West%20Weald%20Inn\"&gt;West Weald Inn&lt;/a&gt;. Once Maglir has been spoken to, he will tell the Hero that the job should have been for three or four people, and believes that he is not paid enough for the job to put his life on the line.\nHe then tells the Hero that they can do the job for him if they would like, and will mark the location of &lt;a href=\"Fallen%20Rock%20Cave\"&gt;Fallen Rock Cave&lt;/a&gt; on the map.\nFallen Rock Cave.\nGo to the cave and kill the &lt;a href=\"Undead%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;undead&lt;/a&gt; inhabiting it. Then go to the back room; it is filled with knee-deep water and contains the journal, which can be found next to a chest in a recession in the cave wall. Take the journal and exit the cave.\nDecisions.\nOnce out of the cave, one will have to decide whether or not to tell Modryn that Maglir was not the one that fulfilled the contract. If the Hero wants more information, they can go back to the Inn and speak with Maglir.\nIf Maglir is spoken to first, there will be two options: the Hero can either tell him that they will tell Modryn that he recovered the journal, or rebuke Maglir for not recovering the journal. If they tell him they will lie for him, he seems reluctant and thanks them. If telling him that they are going to tell the truth, he says that they must do what they think is right.\nReporting to Modryn.\nWhen reporting back to Modryn, there are two options when speaking to him. The Hero can tell him that the contract was not defaulted, and they simply recovered the journal from Maglir, or tell him that Maglir did indeed default, and they had to do the job themselves. The reward is the same amount of &lt;a href=\"Septim%20%28Coin%29\"&gt;gold&lt;/a&gt; either way, but one will get an extra point of &lt;a href=\"Fame\"&gt;Fame&lt;/a&gt; if the truth is told."}

They are asked to talk to her about another merchant, &lt;a href=\"Thoronir\"&gt;Thoronir&lt;/a&gt;. Jensine tells them that Thoronir is selling goods at low prices, causing all the customers in the city to do their deals with him, leaving no customers for the other merchants. It is believed that Thoronir is obtaining his goods illegally in order to keep his prices low, and you're asked to investigate his business practices.\nWalkthrough.\nIntroduction.\nGo to Jensine's shop and ask her about Thoronir and she will tell them that she is the head of the Society of Concerned Merchants. This society is meant to help out all the merchants in the city by working together to keep all business practices fair.\nJensine tells them that Thoronir refuses to join the society and won't even talk to any of the other merchants about it. Because Thoronir recognizes all the merchants in town and they wouldn't be able to spy on him without being noticed, Jensine asks the Hero to find out where Thoronir is getting his goods.\nThoronir's Supplier.\nGo to Thoronir's shop, &lt;a href=\"The%20Copious%20Coinpurse\"&gt;The Copious Coinpurse&lt;/a&gt;, and ask him about his great selection of items. Thoronir will tell them that the way he obtains his wares is a secret which he will not reveal to anyone. Go outside the shop and wait until no later than 8 pm, Thoronir will leave his shop sometime between 8 and 8:30.\nWhen he leaves his shop follow him to the &lt;a href=\"The%20Merchants%20Inn\"&gt;The Merchants Inn&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"Arboretum\"&gt;Arboretum District&lt;/a&gt;, or sometimes the &lt;a href=\"Temple%20of%20the%20One\"&gt;Temple of the One&lt;/a&gt;, depending on the day. Wherever he chooses for the evening, he will stay for about two hours. Wait on him until he leaves.\nEventually Thoronir will walk back toward his shop. Instead of going inside, he turns down a nearby street. Just behind the shop is a small lawn where he will meet with his supplier, &lt;a href=\"Agarmir\"&gt;Agarmir&lt;/a&gt;. Sneak to the tree closest to Thoronir and walk along it to initiate the conversation. Thoronir and Agarmir argue about the goods Agarmir has been bringing to Thoronir lately. When they are done talking they go their separate ways.\nRevealing the Crimes.\nAfter the conversation between the two, the Hero must go to &lt;a href=\"Agarmir%27s%20House\"&gt;Agarmir's House&lt;/a&gt;. They can follow him or simply go to the &lt;a href=\"Talos%20Plaza%20District\"&gt;Talos Plaza District&lt;/a&gt;. His house is South on the road just inside the Western gate.\nWhile he is home his door is barred and one cannot enter. It is difficult to guess when Agarmir will leave his house. Weekdays he will wander in the afternoon, weekends he will leave in the morning. Either ransack his home after the meeting with Thoronir, or wait an hour at a time during the day until he leaves. The door has an average lock so either pick the lock or use the &lt;a href=\"Open%20Average%20Lock\"&gt;Open Average Lock&lt;/a&gt; spell. Alternatively one can pickpocket Agarmir's house key from him then run/fast travel to his house then wait until he leaves.\nAs you search his house, you'll discover that Agarmir has indeed been stealing the goods he sells to Thoronir. Once inside, go behind the stairs to the basement door and there will be another lock to pick. Enter this door and go down the stairs. Inside this room there will be piles of &lt;a href=\"Bonemeal%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;Bonemeal&lt;/a&gt; and a shovel, leading you to believe Agarmir is a graverobber.\nOn a table in a corner of the room you will find a book entitled &lt;a href=\"Macabre%20Manifest\"&gt;Macabre Manifest&lt;/a&gt;, which lists all the graves that Agarmir has robbed and what he has taken. Take this book, leave Agarmir's house, and take it to Thoronir. He will agree to stop buying from Agarmir and tells you he thinks Agarmir is going to rob another grave today. He asks the Hero to bring something else to prove Agarmir has been robbing graves.\nTravel to the &lt;a href=\"Imperial%20City%20Palace\"&gt;Imperial City Palace&lt;/a&gt; and walk through the graveyard until you find the &lt;a href=\"Trentius%20Family%20Mausoleum\"&gt;Trentius Family Mausoleum&lt;/a&gt;. When you enter the mausoleum, you'll find Agarmir and his partner, &lt;a href=\"Rolgarel\"&gt;Rolgarel&lt;/a&gt;. Agarmir tells the Hero he knew you were following him and that he wasn't robbing a grave today. He was actually digging a grave for you and led you into a trap. Both men attack at once and you must kill them both. Alternatively, enter the tomb in stealth and shoot them without even starting a conversation.\nAlternative methods.\nMethod one.\nFocus on killing Agarmir first and when he dies, quickly loot the keys from his body. This will allow escape from the area. Rolgarel will follow, but you can sheath your weapon and run for the guards. The guards will assist and kill Rolgarel, after which you can loot his corpse. This method will not put a bounty on the your head, as long as the Hero first went through the dialog with Agarmir such that he attacks first. It may also be possible to just pickpocket the keys from him during battle (i.e.: one might not need to kill him to escape). If one manage to run far enough away from Rolgarel while doing this, he will stop attacking and will never restart. Instead, he'll return to his place in the mausoleum.\nMethod two.\nAs soon as they enter the mausoleum, talk to Agarmir and initiate the combat sequence. As soon as they come at the Hero, paralyze each with a paralysis spell, and pickpocket Agarmir, taking all of his keys. Run out of the mausoleum, and find some guards. Rolgarel will follow but the guards will easily take care of him. Then, after he is dead (you can lift a level dependant sword and heavy armor off of him, minus the helmet), go back to the mausoleum. Agarmir will not attack them. Take the shovel, and complete the rest of the quest like normal, with little to no combat necessary.\nMethod three.\nWhen Agarmir leaves his house, follow him to the market area and wait in stealth mode until they are behind him and invisible. Pickpocket his Debaser sword. Equip the Debaser and return to the mission (searching his house). When they get to the mausoleum go down the stairs and when Agarmir comes towards them, back up to a corner of the door. Go through the dialog and then attack the unarmed Agarmir and kill him. Search his body, take the key and exit the mausoleum as mentioned above and let the guards despatch Rolgarel.\nConclusion.\nAfter defeating them, they can get the sword &lt;a href=\"Debaser\"&gt;Debaser&lt;/a&gt; from Agarmir's corpse. One will also need his mausoleum key before they can leave. Before leaving, take the shovel Agarmir was using as the final piece of evidence. Also, take a look around the tombs. Hidden behind the tomb of Calliben Trentius is the enchanted mace, &lt;a href=\"Calliben%27s%20Grim%20Retort\"&gt;Calliben's Grim Retort&lt;/a&gt;.\nWhen returning to Thoronir, he tells them he has joined the society and will start selling his goods at fair prices. He gives them the &lt;a href=\"Weatherward%20Circlet\"&gt;Weatherward Circlet&lt;/a&gt; ring to thank for their help. He also improves his Disposition with the Hero, meaning it is easier to haggle better prices with him. After talking to Thoronir, go back to Jensine and she will reward them with 100\u2013600 , depending on level."}

On the &lt;a href=\"Calendar%20%28Daggerfall%29\"&gt;13th of Morning Star&lt;/a&gt; the Prince of Life &lt;a href=\"Meridia\"&gt;Meridia&lt;/a&gt; may be summoned, if the Agent agrees to pay a summoner of either a &lt;a href=\"Witch%20Coven\"&gt;Witch Coven&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Mages%20Guild%20%28Daggerfall%29\"&gt;Mages Guild&lt;/a&gt; or a &lt;a href=\"Temples%20%28Daggerfall%29\"&gt;temple&lt;/a&gt;.\nWalkthrough.\nThe Agent may approach a summoner at either the &lt;a href=\"Mages%20Guild%20%28Daggerfall%29\"&gt;Mages Guild&lt;/a&gt;, a Temple, or a Witch Coven to summon one of the Daedric Princes. If the summoning occurs on the 13th of Morning Star, the Agent may receive a vision of &lt;a href=\"Meridia\"&gt;Meridia&lt;/a&gt;, whom immediately offers them a quest. Indeed, Meridia seeks to reward the Agent's \"ambition,\" and will reward them if they complete their task.\nA Renegade Sorcerer.\nAccepting Meridia's task will reveal that a &lt;a href=\"Sorcerer%20%28Daggerfall%29\"&gt;sorcerer&lt;/a&gt; has decided to \"renege\" on a deal between themselves and the Prince. As such, Meridia requests that the Agent demonstrate that \"ungallant behavior is fatal,\" in return for a token of Meridia's power. This token, the &lt;a href=\"Ring%20of%20Khajiiti%20%28Daggerfall%29\"&gt;Ring of Khajiiti&lt;/a&gt;, will be waiting for the Agent in the hands of one of Meridia's apostles.\nWith that the Agent is off to find the sorcerer, who will be found in a &lt;a href=\"dungeons%20%28Daggerfall%29\"&gt;dungeon&lt;/a&gt; listed in the Agent's journal. Inside the dungeon, the Agent may come across a number of sorcerers, so they will have to keep attacking the wizards until one of them utters:\n\"So, Meridia sends her lackeys against me. But I am not without allies of my own. Come to me, children of Oblivion! Serve your master [Sorcerer's name] in [his/her] hour of need!\"\nUpon completing that statement the sorcerer will summon a group of &lt;a href=\"Fire%20Daedra%20%28Daggerfall%29\"&gt;fire daedra&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Daedroth%20%28Daggerfall%29\"&gt;daedroths&lt;/a&gt;, which will all attack the Agent. They will continue to appear until the sorcerer lies dead, which will be highlighted by the following notification:\n\"[Sorcerer's name] lies dead at your feet. Lady Meridia is now in your debt.\"\nWith that, the Agent simply has to escape the dungeon, journey to the town mentioned by Meridia, and meet with the Prince's apostle. Speaking with the apostle before the time limit expires will complete the quest successfully.\nRewards.\nCompleting the quest successfully within the time limit will see the Agent rewarded with the &lt;a href=\"Ring%20of%20Khajiiti%20%28Daggerfall%29\"&gt;Ring of Khajiit&lt;/a&gt; by the Prince's apostle. The Agent will also receive a boost in reputation with the faction whom summoned the Prince for them, as well as the faction's associates. Conversely, failing the quest will result in the Agent losing reputation with the summoner's faction.\nThe changes made to reputation, either by successfully completing or failing the quest are shown below:"}

Word of unsettled spirits, shambling corpses, and worse spreads across &lt;a href=\"Tamriel\"&gt;Tamriel&lt;/a&gt;, planting seeds of fear in common folk.

Unwilling spirits are often involved, and in the eyes of any rational being, the \"study\" of this type of magic is . It should not be surprising to you that much knowledge of necromancy is attributed to &lt;a href=\"Daedra%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Daedric&lt;/a&gt; forces, specifically those of the abhorrent &lt;a href=\"Molag%20Bal%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Molag Bal&lt;/a&gt;, further cementing it as a sphere that must be shunned.\nI present to you now an accounting of the general types of undead:\n\"The Reanimated\"\nThese monstrosities are formed when a necromancer summons and instills an enslaved spirit into a corpse or construct of bodies. Reanimations take many shapes, from the lowly &lt;a href=\"Skeleton%20%28Online%29\"&gt;skeleton&lt;/a&gt; (favorite of novice necromancers) to the hulking &lt;a href=\"Flesh%20Atronach%20%28Online%29\"&gt;flesh atronach&lt;/a&gt;. The need for unconsecrated corpses poses a danger to communities, as it is known to drive wayward mages to murder in their lust for power. To minimize encounters with reanimations, avoid poorly-kept graveyards and hidden caves or ruins, and report any suspicion of necromancy to your local authorities for investigation.\n\"The Returned\"\n&lt;a href=\"Ghost%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Ghosts&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Wraith%20%28Online%29\"&gt;wraiths&lt;/a&gt;, and spectres manifest for a variety of reasons.

Some are even ancestors bound by their own families, a practice the &lt;a href=\"Dunmer%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Dark Elves&lt;/a&gt; claim is not necromancy at all\u2014guarwash!\nMy recent studies into the phenomenon known as the &lt;a href=\"Soulburst\"&gt;Soulburst&lt;/a&gt; indicate a tie between it and a surge in returned sightings and activity, strongly implicating a persistent disruption in natural post-extant soul conveyance. Detractors to this theory, notably the misguided &lt;a href=\"Lady%20Cinnabar\"&gt;Lady Cinnabar&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"Taneth\"&gt;Taneth&lt;/a&gt;, have yet to produce any counter-theories that do not crumble under the slightest scrutiny.\n\"The Accursed\"\nUndeath is not always a product of renegade mages tampering with souls and rotting flesh. Cursed diseases such as can corrupt the living. The result is an undead creature that requires the blood of the living for sustenance. &lt;a href=\"Vampire%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Vampires&lt;/a&gt; have a tendency to organize into reclusive clans, hiding away beneath the ground and surfacing only to obtain more thralls to feed upon. In some cases, though, their minds are known to degrade to the point of insanity, leaving a raging husk of a &lt;a href=\"Creatures%20%28Online%29\"&gt;creature&lt;/a&gt; with no mental capacity commonly called a \"&lt;a href=\"bloodfiend\"&gt;bloodfiend&lt;/a&gt;.\" Any sightings of such creatures should be reported to a local &lt;a href=\"Fighters%20Guild%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Fighters Guild&lt;/a&gt;.\n\"Abominable Miscegenations\"\nSome undead defy simple classification. The &lt;a href=\"Lich%20%28Online%29\"&gt;lich&lt;/a&gt;, for one, is a corpse that is self-reanimated by the soul it bore in life. Typically, only powerful spellcasters seeking immortality achieve this state. Luckily for common folk, liches are often focused obsessively on continuing their own studies, and they are not likely to be encountered by travelers that keep their noses out of ancient ruins.\nNow that you are more informed about this vile art and its repellent products, hopefully you are better-prepared to assess undead threats. It goes without saying (though I will certainly say it) that we all have a responsibility to report and combat necromancy, especially in these times. Do not let anyone convince you that there is some kind of benefit to be had in exploring these detestable magics\u2014any reasonable individual can see the madness in such a claim."}

These patrols were comprised of many Vigil Veterans and Enforcers (heavily armored and experienced members), including Vigilant &lt;a href=\"Fenrik\"&gt;Fenrik&lt;/a&gt;, who was a personal friend of Azarain. \nFollowing Azarain to Dawnstar, the Dragonborn retrieves an anonymous note from his room in &lt;a href=\"Windpeak%20Inn\"&gt;Windpeak Inn&lt;/a&gt;. The note is addressed to Vigilant Azarain offering help in his investigation and includes instructions to meet at the &lt;a href=\"Windward%20Ruins\"&gt;Windward Ruins&lt;/a&gt;, alone. There, the Dragonborn discovers that Vigilant Azarain has been murdered by a cult member. Recovering Azarain's journal, the Dragonborn can proceed by following the three suspects or by using the &lt;a href=\"Pickpocket\"&gt;Pickpocket&lt;/a&gt; skill to see if they are holding any incriminating evidence. The three suspects are:\nIf pickpocketed, Harald is revealed to be carrying bloody clothes, though the Dragonborn does not need to take them to complete the objective. Alternately, if following Harald in the night, he will return to the quicksilver mine and open a secret entrance to the shrine. \nInside, the Dragonborn discovers the bodies of the dead Vigil patrols and the secret sect of Daedra worshippers led by Vigilant &lt;a href=\"Fenrik\"&gt;Fenrik&lt;/a&gt;. The final task is to eliminate the sect. \nFenrik's journal shows that he betrayed the Vigil in pursuit of a cure for Vampirism, a line of investigation expressly forbidden by the order. Finding no support in the Vigil, he instead turned to Molag Bal to learn of a cure, but the price was steep: nine members of the Vigil as a dark sacrifice (one for each of the divines). Fenrik indicates in his journal that his resolve only strengthened after each sacrifice, but that he could not bring himself to kill Vigilant Azarain. \nThese events imply that the deaths of so many experienced Vigil members severely weakened the order and made them vulnerable to attack by the Vampires, even though the schemes were unrelated to one another.\nReward.\nThe shrine includes the bodies of six Vigil members wearing an assortment of Vigil Enforcer and Veteran gear, as well as one set of Vigil Silver Hand Armor on a nearby table. Two sets of Vigil Corrupted Armor are in the room as well, with one set on Vigilant Fenrik, and a second on one of the bodies being prepared for burial."}

{"id": "16850", "revid": "17401442", "url": "https://elderscrolls.fandom.com/wiki?curid=16850", "title": "Unicorn (Oblivion)", "text": "The Unicorn is a type of &lt;a href=\"Horse%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;mount&lt;/a&gt; that can be found at &lt;a href=\"Harcane%20Grove\"&gt;Harcane Grove&lt;/a&gt;, where it is guarded by three &lt;a href=\"Minotaurs%20of%20the%20Grove\"&gt;Minotaurs of the Grove&lt;/a&gt;. To mount the horse, one must sneak up to it and press the use button. However, the unicorn will become provoked and will attack if the &lt;a href=\"Hero%20of%20Kvatch\"&gt;Hero&lt;/a&gt; approaches while wielding a weapon (this includes &lt;a href=\"Hand-to-Hand%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;fists&lt;/a&gt;).\nOnce mounted, the unicorn is considered the Hero's property and will fast travel with them, but it cannot be armored with the &lt;a href=\"Horse%20Armor\"&gt;horse armor pack&lt;/a&gt;. If the Hero gets off the unicorn and it starts walking away, it will eventually make its way back to the Grove. It can be stopped by re-mounting it. Otherwise, the unicorn acts just like any horse; it will stay with the Hero while they wait, rest, or do other things. If the unicorn is killed in any way, it will not respawn.\nIf one plans on killing the unicorn, it can only be harmed by &lt;a href=\"Magicka%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;magic&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Silver%20Weapons%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;silver&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Daedric%20Weapons%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;daedric&lt;/a&gt;, or &lt;a href=\"Enchanted%20Weapons%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;enchanted weapons&lt;/a&gt;. The Unicorn can also be harmed by wild animals, and fall damage.\nBehavior.\nIf a weapon is drawn in the vicinity of the Unicorn, it will become hostile; this occurs to both the player and non-player characters. If this happens it is advised to fight it rather than run away, as it will always catch up no matter what. Because it is fast, the best solution is to mount the horse and place it in a remote area.\nIf it is brought to an area around NPCs (for example: guards or &lt;a href=\"Blades%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;Blades&lt;/a&gt;), they will attack the Unicorn. In order to keep the Unicorn as a 'steed,' it is advisable to leave it away from guards and other NPCs. The mount will also become aggressive if the Hero mounts another horse to replace it.\nQuests.\n&lt;a href=\"Hircine%20%28Quest%29\"&gt;Hircine&lt;/a&gt;.\n&lt;a href=\"Hircine\"&gt;Hircine&lt;/a&gt;'s followers have told the &lt;a href=\"Hero%20of%20Kvatch\"&gt;Hero&lt;/a&gt; that, in order to summon the &lt;a href=\"Daedric%20Prince\"&gt;Daedric Prince&lt;/a&gt;, they must leave an offering of a &lt;a href=\"Wolf%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;wolf pelt&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"Bear%20Pelt%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;bear pelt&lt;/a&gt; at the statue.\nAs an alternative to this quest, Hircine's commands can be refused. Hircine shows disapproval, but the Unicorn may then be kept as a mount. This course of action closes every possibility for receiving the &lt;a href=\"Savior%27s%20Hide%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;Savior's Hide&lt;/a&gt;."}

He had begun teaching me to fight the moment I was able to pick up a blade. Mother had argued that I was too young, but he paid her no mind. I can still remember the elation I felt the first time I bested Father in a match and the look of pride on his face. If it were up to him I know he would have allowed me to join him in battle. With me at his side he may have fared better. Now with father and so many others slain, the Old Ones claim we are left with too few warriors to continue the fight. I was not the only young one to speak out in protest, but our small voices went unheard. It has been decided that we must flee to seek help and protection.\nEighth of Evening Star\nNews has reached us that the great &lt;a href=\"Snow%20Prince\"&gt;Snow Prince&lt;/a&gt; has fallen in battle. The urgency to go into hiding has left many of us scattered and those of us still together unsure of which direction to turn. In the long hours of night we keep huddled together always fearing the worst until the first light of the blessed sun. May &lt;a href=\"Auri-El\"&gt;Auri-El&lt;/a&gt; guide our footsteps.\nThirteenth of Evening Star\nIn the night I overheard the Old Ones whispering secrets of the underground and the &lt;a href=\"Dwemer\"&gt;Dwemer&lt;/a&gt; who dwell there. I thought back on stories Father once told me of these dwarves, heroic tales of honor and glory. The Old Ones must know of these stories for it has been decided that we will change course upon first light. I feel hopeful that the Dwemer will help us to avenge our fallen and reclaim our land."}

I dare not write where we stay for fear of endangering the good people of this house should this diary be discovered. We have been shown a kindness by this family once known to the &lt;a href=\"Snow%20Prince\"&gt;Snow Prince&lt;/a&gt;. Even in death his great influence has ensured our safety. We were separated from many of our kin along the road when it became increasingly difficult to travel discreetly in our numbers. We were forced to go our separate ways and travel only at night. I have heard no news of where the others may have gone and fear I never shall. Our lives are forever changed.\n\"Seventy Marking\"\nTenth Kulniir\"\"\nIn the night I find it difficult not to focus on times past. There are moments in my rest when I still hear the laughing of young ones at play in the valley. Other times I see the pale fleckes of happy moments which were once so common in the land of the &lt;a href=\"Snow%20Elves\"&gt;Snow Elves&lt;/a&gt;. I try not to dwell on these memories too long. Often the surroundings make it impossible to dwell on any happiness. We have been locked together in such close quarters for so long. We grow tired of each others company. Even the strongest of us have faltered, with nothing to do but think on what is lost. I wake each day to forlorn faces and am reminded of where we are and all we have left behind. We are all yearning for a day when we can emerge from hiding and walk freely in the light once more, but I fear we are losing all hope that such a day will even come.\n\"Tenth Marking\"\nTenth Kulniir\"\"\nI tire of the tears of women and children. My own have run dry. The men have begun to look upon us as if we are all weak, yet we have survived the same trials as they. I cannot bring myself to think on the numbers we lost in battle, yet I cannot force the images of my own losses from my mind and now, in a time when our people should be banding together in feels, we are drifting apart. The &lt;a href=\"Nords\"&gt;Nords&lt;/a&gt; have truly won. Our once great pride and unity are shattered. If we lose hope now we will never survive. Today many, myself included, have tried to speak out in voices of reason. There can be no hope without talk of our future. We can make no difference if our spirits remain broken.\n\"Eighteenth Marking\"\nTenth Kulniir\"\"\nWe know that we can never again be the Snow Elves and live freely. In that world we will forever be in hiding in one form or another, but there is no reason we cannot live life with the sun and the wind against our skin. There are those here who are friends to us and plan to help us once the threat has ended. We know now to survive, we must be born anew outside. We will appear. We belong here inside. We will carry our truth and our scars."}

The Elves would have had to travel to different &lt;a href=\"Wayshrines%20%28Dawnguard%29\"&gt;Wayshrines&lt;/a&gt; with an urn which they would fill with water at each shrine. According to this text, it was an incredibly difficult journey. The &lt;a href=\"Last%20Dragonborn\"&gt;Dragonborn&lt;/a&gt; must take this journey to obtain &lt;a href=\"Auriel%27s%20Bow%20%28Dawnguard%29\"&gt;Auriel's Bow&lt;/a&gt; during .\nTranslated content (&lt;a href=\"Touching%20the%20Sky%20%28Book%29\"&gt;Touching the Sky&lt;/a&gt;).\nTouching the Sky\n&lt;a href=\"Parnion%20Saldor\"&gt;Parnion Saldor&lt;/a&gt;\nMany of the most dedicated &lt;a href=\"Snow%20Elf\"&gt;Snow Elves&lt;/a&gt; once committed themselves to a tireless journey through the &lt;a href=\"Chantry%20of%20Auri-El\"&gt;Chantry&lt;/a&gt;, to &lt;a href=\"Inner%20Sanctum\"&gt;the temple&lt;/a&gt;. They carried with them the paramount desire to become one with their god &lt;a href=\"Auriel\"&gt;Auriel&lt;/a&gt;. Though all set out with the determination to prove their worth, few were prepared for the trials that lay ahead, for the path to Auriel was not without its tribulations. The pilgrims struggled not only against the natural elements of the &lt;a href=\"Forgotten%20Vale\"&gt;treacherous Vale&lt;/a&gt;, but with a myriad of tests upon their faith and loyalty.\nIt is told that many simply could not continue on the path for long before turning back. Some argue that the rebuke they endured upon their return was crueler than the punishment that may have lay ahead of them along the path. In their failed attempt they were forced to live in the shadow of those who did continue on to achieve the great glory and honor of ascension into the light forever. After their faith and loyalty in Auriel would be scrutinized and their remaining days filled with shame and regret.\nTales of those who reached the &lt;a href=\"Inner%20Sanctum\"&gt;Inner Sanctum&lt;/a&gt; are not without their share of woes. It is said upon their arrival that many were mere shells of the person they had once been. Some went quite from sleeplessness and starved to the point of frailty by the end of their journey. The marvel that they had strength yet to carry &lt;a href=\"Initiate%27s%20Ewer\"&gt;their vessel&lt;/a&gt; and ascend the stairs of the temple was the last true testament of their loyalty. Regardless of each individuals tale, the final words remain eerily similar. It is said that every pilgrim ascended bathed in light, a look of relief and contentment on their face."}

I know there's no &lt;a href=\"Honor%20Among%20Thieves\"&gt;honor among thieves&lt;/a&gt;, and there never was, but there used to be some pride, some skill, some basic creativity. It really makes those of us with a sense of history despair.\"\nImalyn sneered, slamming down his flagon of &lt;a href=\"Greef%20%28Morrowind%29\"&gt;greef&lt;/a&gt; violently on the rough-hewn table. \"B'vek, what do you want us to say? You asks us 'What do you do when you see a guard?' and I says, 'Stab the fetcher in the back.' What d'you prefer? We challenge 'em to a game of chits?\"\n\"So much ambition, so little education,\" said Lledos with a sigh. \"My dear friends, we aren't mugging some &lt;a href=\"Nords%20%28Morrowind%29\"&gt;Nord&lt;/a&gt; tourist fresh off the ferry. The &lt;a href=\"Cobblers%20Guildhall\"&gt;Cobblers Guildhall&lt;/a&gt; may not sound intimidating but tonight, when the dues collection is housed there before being sent to the bank, the security's going to be tighter than a &lt;a href=\"kwama%20%28Morrowind%29\"&gt;kwama&lt;/a&gt;'s ass. You can't just stab at every back you encounter and expect to make it into the vaults.\"\n\"Why don't you explain specifically what you'd like us to do?\" asked Galsiah calmly, trying to keep the tone of the group down. Most locals at the &lt;a href=\"Plot%20and%20Plaster\"&gt;Plot and Plaster&lt;/a&gt; cornerclub in &lt;a href=\"Tel%20Aruhn%20%28Morrowind%29\"&gt;Tel Aruhn&lt;/a&gt; knew enough not to listen in, but she knew better than to take any chances.\n\"The common thief,\" said Lledos, pouring himself more greef, warming to his subject. \"Sticks his dagger in his opponent's back. This may slay the target, but more often gives him time to scream and drenches the attacker with blood. Not good. Now a good throat-slashing, properly executed, can both slay and silence a guard and leave the thief relatively bloodfree. And after all, after the robbery, we don't want people seeing a bunch of blood-soaked butchers running through the streets. Even in Tel Aruhn, that's likely to warrant suspicion.\n\"If you can catch your victim lying down asleep or resting, you are in an excellent position. You place one hand over the mouth with your thumb under the chin, then you use your other hand to slit the throat, and quickly turn the head to one side so the body bleeds out away from you. There is a risk here of becoming blood stained if you don't move the head quickly enough. If you're unsure, strangle the victim first to avoid the blood that tends to spurt out in three foot jets when someone is stabbed while alive.\n\"A very good friend of mine, a thief in &lt;a href=\"Gnisis%20%28Morrowind%29\"&gt;Gnisis&lt;/a&gt; whose name I won't mention, swears by the strangle-and-slash technique. Simply put, you grab your victim's throat from behind and while throttling him, you batter his face against the opposite wall. When the victim is thus rendered unconscious, you slash his throat while still holding him from behind, and the risk of staining one's clothes with blood is practically .\n\"The classic technique, which requires less grappling than my friend's variation, is to place one hand over the victim's mouth, and then saw through the throat in three or four stroke rather like playing a violin. It requires little effort, and while there's quite a bit of blood, it all jets forward away from you.\nThere's no reason when one knows one is going to be slitting some throats not to take some precautions and bring some extra equipment. The best neck-hackers I know generally carry a bit of wadded cloth on the aft-side of their knives to keep blood from getting on their cuffs. It's impractical for this sort of assignment, but when you're only anticipating one or two victims, nothing beats throwing a sack over the targets head, drawing the string tight, and then supplying the killing blow or blows.\"\nImalyn laughed loudly, \"Can I see a demonstration sometime?\"\n\"Very soon,\" said Lledos. \"If Galsiah has done her job.\"\nGalsiah brought out the map of the guildhouse, freshly stolen, and they began to detail out the strategy.\nThe last several hours had been a whirlwind to all. In less than a day, the three had met, formulated a plan, bought or stolen the necessary ingredients, and were about to execute it. Not one of the three were sure whether confidence or stupidity were driving the other two, but the fates were aligned. The guildhouse was going to be robbed.\nWhen the sun set, Lledos, Galsiah, and Imalyn approached the Cobblers Guildhouse on the east end of town. Galsiah used her cachous of &lt;a href=\"stoneflower\"&gt;stoneflower&lt;/a&gt; to mask their scent from the guard wolves as the three passed over the parapets. She also acted as lead scout, and Lledos was impressed. For someone of relative inexperience, she knew her way through shadows.\nLledos's expertise was demonstrated a dozen times, and the guards were of such a diverse variety, he was able to demonstrate all the means of silent assassination he had developed over the years.\nImalyn opened the vault in his unique and systematic method. As the tumblers fell beneath his fingers, he softly sang an old dirty tavern song about the Ninety-Nine Loves of &lt;a href=\"Boethiah\"&gt;Boethiah&lt;/a&gt;. He said it helped him focus and organize difficult combinations. Within seconds, the vault was open and the gold was in hand.\nThey left the guildhouse an hour after they entered. No alarm had been raised, the gold was gone, and corpses lay pooling blood on the stone floors within.\n\"Well done, my friends, well done. You learned well.\" Lledos said as he poured the gold pieces into the specially designed compartments in his tunic's sleeves, where they held fast with no jingling or unusual bulges. \"We'll meet back at the Plot and Plaster tomorrow morning and split up the bounty.\"\nThe group parted ways. The only person who knew the most covert route through the city's sewer system, Lledos, slipped in through a duct and vanished below. Galsiah threw on her shawl, muddied her face to resemble an old f'lah fortune-teller, and headed north. Imalyn headed east into the park, trusting his unnatural senses to keep him away from the citywatch.\nNow I teach them the greatest lesson of all, thought Lledos as he sloshed through the labyrinthine tunnels of sludge. His guar was waiting where he left it at the city gates, making a laconic lunch of the chokeweed shrub to which it had been leashed.\nOn the road to &lt;a href=\"Vivec%20City%20%28Morrowind%29\"&gt;Vivec&lt;/a&gt;, he thought of Galsiah and Imalyn. Perhaps they had been caught and brought in for questioning already. It was a pity he couldn't see them undergoing interrogation. Who would break under pressure first? Imalyn was certainly the tougher of the two, but Galsiah doubtless had hidden reserves. It was merely intellectual curiosity: they thought his name was Lledos and he was meeting them at the Plot and Plaster. The authorities wouldn't therefore be looking for a &lt;a href=\"Dunmer%20%28Morrowind%29\"&gt;Dunmer&lt;/a&gt; named Sathis celebrating his wealth miles and miles away in Vivec.\nAs he prodded his mount forward and the sun began rising, Sathis pictured Galsiah and Imalyn not undergoing interrogation, but sleeping the good deep sleep of the wicked, dreaming of how they would spend their share of the gold. Both would wake up early and rush to the Plot and Plaster. He could see them now, Imalyn laughing and carrying on, Galsiah hushing him to avoid bringing undue attention. They would take a couple flagons of greef, perhaps order a meal\u2014a big one\u2014and wait. Hours would pass, and so would their moods. The chain of reactions that every betrayed person exhibits: nervousness, doubt, bewilderment, anger.\nThe sun was fully risen when Sathis reached the stables of his house on the outskirts of Vivec. He reigned in his guar and filled its feed. The rest of the stalls were empty. It wouldn't be until that afternoon when his servants returned from the feast of St &lt;a href=\"Rilms\"&gt;Rilms&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Gnisis%20%28Morrowind%29\"&gt;Gnisis&lt;/a&gt;. They were good people, and he treated them well, but from past experience he knew that servants talked. If they began to connect his absences with thefts in other towns, it was only a matter of time before they would go to the authorities or blackmail him. After all, they were human. It was best in the long run to give them a week off with pay whenever he was out of town on business.\nHe slipped the gold into the vault in his study, and went upstairs. The schedule had been tight, but Sathis had given himself a few hours to rest before his household returned. His own bed was wonderfully soft and warm compared to the dreadful mattress he had to use at the canton in Tel Aruhn.\nSathis woke up some time later from a nightmare. For a second after he opened his eyes, he thought he could still hear Imalyn's voice nearby, singing The Ninety-Nine Loves of &lt;a href=\"Boethiah\"&gt;Boethiah&lt;/a&gt;. He lay still in his bed, waiting, but there was no sound except the usual creaks and groans of his old house. Afternoon sunlight came through his bedroom window in ribbons, catching dust. He closed his eyes.\nThe song returned, and Sathis heard the vault door in his study swing open. The smell of &lt;a href=\"stoneflower\"&gt;stoneflower&lt;/a&gt; filled his nose and he opened his eyes. Only a little of the afternoon sunlight could pierce the inside of the burlap sack.\nA strong, feminine hand clamped over the mouth and a thumb jabbed under his chin. Just as his throat opened and his head was shoved to the side, he heard Galsiah in her typical calm voice, \"Thank you for the lesson, Sathis.\""}

And like all - dare I say - religious experiences, returning to my mundane senses, I am left with little more than a faded memory of supernal knowledge, like a burned parchment on which once were written words of wisdom and understanding, of which now only torn and blurred fragments remain.\nThe harder I try to remember that innate knowledge, the more it seems to recede from me. The essence that remains is this:\nPain is a force that purifies, ennobles, and uplifts. It is the Fire that burns away impurities, that melts away imperfections.\nDeath is not the sign of weakness, nor bodily constitution the sign of strength. It is what happens to soul when brought into the Fire that determines the mettle of men.\nThose with inner strength are forged into weapons of devastating keenness by Pain's Fire. Those who are undeserving and weak turn to dark and lifeless ash in Its heat.\nAnd there it stands in all its inscrutability - so much for an unproductive day.

It is also possible to stop Unrelenting Force with a &lt;a href=\"Ward%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;ward&lt;/a&gt;; &lt;a href=\"Necromancer%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Necromancers&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Conjurer%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Conjurers&lt;/a&gt; often employ this tactic. &lt;a href=\"Alduin%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Alduin&lt;/a&gt; does not stagger when hit with the shout but it does deal damage to him.\nUsage.\nWhile the damage caused by this Shout is minimal in most cases, it is useful for creating openings to attack an enemy or thinning out a crowd. It can also give the user breathing room and allow them to run from high leveled enemies, such as &lt;a href=\"Giant%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;giants&lt;/a&gt;. It can be used, when fully upgraded, to blast foes off the top of long drops and let gravity dispose of them. &lt;a href=\"Sailor%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Sailors&lt;/a&gt; are an exception to this, being the only characters in Skyrim which can be killed with all three words by default.\nAs of expansion, Unrelenting Force has a more pronounced effect on certain objects in the game: insects (such as &lt;a href=\"Torchbugs%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;torchbugs&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Luna%20Moth\"&gt;moths&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Dragonflies%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;dragonflies&lt;/a&gt;) can be \"knocked down,\" and all varieties of &lt;a href=\"Fish%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;fish&lt;/a&gt; (except Slaughterfish) can be killed when hit with the effect of this Shout, for example. &lt;a href=\"Salmon\"&gt;Salmon&lt;/a&gt; killed in this manner yield both &lt;a href=\"Salmon%20Meat\"&gt;salmon meat&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Salmon%20Roe\"&gt;salmon roe&lt;/a&gt;, just as if they were killed by a bow.\nHowever, with the &lt;a href=\"Dragonborn%20Force\"&gt;Dragonborn Force&lt;/a&gt; effect in the DLC, the shout boasts extremely devastating consequences, instantly killing weaker enemies and dealing significant damage to others, maintaining usefulness even against boss level enemies (except for large creatures and &lt;a href=\"Dragon%20Priest\"&gt;dragon priests&lt;/a&gt;), especially when combined with the other \"Dragonborn\" shout, &lt;a href=\"Dragon%20Aspect%20%28Dragonborn%29\"&gt;Dragon Aspect&lt;/a&gt;. This makes the shout much more versatile, and an overall more viable shout over the likes of &lt;a href=\"Fire%20Breath%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;fire&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"Frost%20Breath\"&gt;frost breath&lt;/a&gt;, especially in places with tight corners and &lt;a href=\"Draugr%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;draugr&lt;/a&gt;-infested dungeons. Dragonborn Force can also cause anyone killed by the shout to disintegrate into ash."}

She has noticed a Khajiit soldier nearby, and will ask you to go talk to them. \nThat soldier is &lt;a href=\"Lieutenant%20Kazargi\"&gt;Lieutenant Kazargi&lt;/a&gt; on the shore nearby. If you speak with her, you will learn that she is under the command of &lt;a href=\"Lord%20Gharesh-ri\"&gt;Lord Gharesh-ri&lt;/a&gt;, the Speaker for the &lt;a href=\"Mane\"&gt;Mane&lt;/a&gt;. He ordered her to protect the refugees here while he musters the defense inside the city. Karzagi will tell you to go speak with him if you wish to help, though she does not know his exact location. She will direct you to the refugees &lt;a href=\"Naaril\"&gt;Naaril&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Curinwe\"&gt;Curinwe&lt;/a&gt;, for they spoke to Gharesh-ri before he left. \nThey will tell you to head across the swamp. Proceed through, but beware the &lt;a href=\"Hoarvor\"&gt;Hoarvor&lt;/a&gt;s along the way. When you enter the city, head into the abandoned house to your right, and you will find Gharesh-ri there. If you offer him to help, he will ask you to go spy on the leaders of the pirates and note down anything they say to each other, to find out what they are doing in Haven. \n&lt;a href=\"Artificer%20Hlana\"&gt;Artificer Hlana&lt;/a&gt; can be found in the northwest of town; she will be hostile, but you will find ' on the table next to her, which will describe a ritual of some kind. Next, head for the big house in the west. &lt;a href=\"Warleader%20Yngold\"&gt;Warleader Yngold&lt;/a&gt; will be there; if you succeed on eavesdropping on him, he will order a soldier to collect dead bodies. If you opt to just kill him, you will find ' on a crate next to him, which will detail the same thing. Finally, you can find &lt;a href=\"Jeer-Tei\"&gt;Jeer-Tei&lt;/a&gt; on the docks to the south, on the westernmost ship. You can overhear him talking about getting a &lt;a href=\"Wamasu%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Wamasu&lt;/a&gt; in the city's aquifer, or you can kill him and learn the same thing from \"\" which is lying in the same room as him. \nWith this information, head for the aquifer; the entrance is northwest of Jeer-Tei's ship. You will find Lieutenant Kazargi next to the entrance; relay to her what you have learned and she will head back to Gharesh-ri to get reinforcements. Next, head through the aquifer and fight your way through hordes of &lt;a href=\"Jackdaw%20Pirates\"&gt;Jackdaw Pirates&lt;/a&gt;. In the northern room, you will find the Wamasu described by Jeer-Tei and its handler; you will have to fight them or sneak around them. In the room thereafter, you will find a rope you can climb into the pirate-held fort. Use the mechanism there to open the gate so that Gharesh-ri's troops can get inside, then head out and speak with him. \nLord Gharesh-ri will tell you that the ritual the pirates are using to fill the streets with undead is being conducted from the Fighters Guild. The place is locked down, but he has found a key on the body of one of the pirates. He will distract the pirates from the fort while you sneak into the guild and kill the pirate leaders. The fighters guild is in the south of town; left of the entrance, you will find the lorebook \"&lt;a href=\"In%20the%20Company%20of%20Wood%20Orcs\"&gt;In the Company of Wood Orcs&lt;/a&gt;\", so be sure to pick that up. Either way, head in and slay the pirate leader, &lt;a href=\"Gjarma%20Raven-Hair\"&gt;Gjarma Raven-Hair&lt;/a&gt;. You will be set upon by numerous undead and pirates once the captain is gone, so kill those as well. After that, destroy the crystals being used for the ritual, and head back outside. \nYou will find Lieutenant Kazargi there, injured. Speak with her; you can lie to her and tell her she will probably be fine, or you can be honest and say she will most likely not make it. Either way, she will direct you to speak with Gharesh-ri. He will be in the center of town, near the fountain. Speak with him to finish the quest."}

Whatever horrible fates you may have guessed for us, however, are probably far from the truth of what has happened.\nI send this letter in hopes that it will sooth [sic] a worried mind.\nMaybe a week after you left with the rest of the healthy folk, I was patrolling the low wall by foot. Even our poor Kelter had taken the illness and was unfit to ride. I was praying that no &lt;a href=\"Bandits%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;bandits&lt;/a&gt; would be foolish enough to risk infection for our trifling goods. Then, outlined against the pyre-light of the day's lost, I saw a long figure marching towards the village.\nThe stranger was a &lt;a href=\"Summerset\"&gt;Summerset&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"elf\"&gt;elf&lt;/a&gt; who introduced himself as &lt;a href=\"Orchendor\"&gt;Orchendor&lt;/a&gt;, and with him came a change in destiny for the folk of Cul Aloue.\nOrchendor walked among our people without fear of the wasting sickness that had taken root in the marrow of every remaining villager, myself included by now. For days he ate and spoke with us, learning each name. He calmed the folk in a way my lying prayers could not. Spirits became cheerful that days before awaited bleakly in the death's parlor.\nOrchendor assembled us then, crowding the villagers into Cullete's barn, she being the most badly stricken at that time, and unable to move without being carried by Orchendor himself.\nThe good elf then gave us tidings that none could have guessed. He claimed that the sickness was not a curse on our village, as we were sure it had been. Rather, Orchendor insisted, it was a boon, a beacon which drew him to us. He told us that he served the &lt;a href=\"Daedric%20Prince\"&gt;Daedric Prince&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Peryite\"&gt;Peryite&lt;/a&gt;.\nI know what you're thinking - we burned Dina and Lucas not three years before, after all. Cul Aloue would never suffer the heresies of a &lt;a href=\"Daedra%20Worship\"&gt;Daedra Worship&lt;/a&gt;per in our midst. Yet, we did. Not only that, but we raptly heard what he had to say. Maybe you think we were too sick, too weak, but we weren't.\nOrchendor apologized for our dead, saying he came with all haste to Cul Aloue. None had perished since his arrival, though several seemed on the brink in the hours before. He wanted to take us to a new home, a place where we could live out our days in worship of Peryite as his chosen. As his &lt;a href=\"Afflicted\"&gt;Afflicted&lt;/a&gt;.\nNobody refused. Some were carried in carts and litters, but all made the trek with Orchendor across the border into &lt;a href=\"Skyrim\"&gt;Skyrim&lt;/a&gt;, leaving Cul Aloue an empty, haunted place.\nWe have since lived in refuge, the ruins of an &lt;a href=\"Bthardamz%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;ancient Dwarven city&lt;/a&gt;. Other Afflicted live with us, many with similar tales to that of Cul Aloue, bound together by our divine infection. Though you could say we are all sick, the effects of the sickness no longer diminish us, but give us strength. We heal ourselves with liquors and tinctures that other men would call poison.\nOrchendor keeps us safe here, by the blessing of our Prince Peryite. I am now an Apostle of the Afflicted, tasked to disseminate the teachings of Peryite to our Afflicted.\nAnd so, sweet Duphraime, the spirit of Cul Aloue lives on. I will never blame you for abandoning us that day, now long past. In truth, I am saddened that you were not likewise chosen by Peryite to awake with these oozing lungs. Peryite preserve you, dear husband, and know your children are well."}

Alas, she took the primary reagent with her, leaving us in dire straits indeed. I formally request that a tribunal be convened to discuss this treachery and devise an appropriate punishment for Garrana, should she be found.\nI place my hand upon &lt;a href=\"Red%20Diamond\"&gt;the Diamond&lt;/a&gt; and swear to you that I will make every effort to perform the ritual, despite this hardship. I would be remiss if I did not reiterate my admonition from before; certain aspects of this spell teeter on the brink of &lt;a href=\"Necromancy\"&gt;necromantic practice&lt;/a&gt;. Magic that influences or otherwise alters the soul always carries risk. But, as we discussed, the threat of &lt;a href=\"Knahaten%20Flu\"&gt;Knahaten infection&lt;/a&gt;, by my estimation, poses a far greater threat to the academy's students and faculty. Conducting the ritual without Garrana's reagent poses a higher risk of failure, but we must take action, lest the fate of &lt;a href=\"Centurion%20Vitulasius\"&gt;Centurion Vitulasius&lt;/a&gt; spread to other occupants of the academy.\nMay the &lt;a href=\"Eight%20Divines\"&gt;Eight&lt;/a&gt; bless this endeavor and our beloved &lt;a href=\"Empire\"&gt;Empire&lt;/a&gt;.\nYour servant,\nBattle-Mage &lt;a href=\"Jano%20Invel\"&gt;Jano Invel&lt;/a&gt;"}

They will be given several warnings by the guards until they receive a bounty.\nThe ladder to the next floor will always be a few feet to the left of the previous one.

Lex should be asleep but enter &lt;a href=\"sneak%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;sneak&lt;/a&gt; mode just in case so he doesn't rouse.

The desk where the money and tax records are stored is to the right, it is also locked. Be careful about waking him up. After stealing the list and taxes go back downstairs, return to the &lt;a href=\"Garden%20of%20Dareloth\"&gt;Garden of Dareloth&lt;/a&gt;, and wait for Christophe.\nArmand is pleased with their efforts, though he finds the amount they stole less than what he expected.

This will teleport you to the home so you can do a walkthrough while making your purchase decision. You can also preview homes from the Collections window, and also by simply finding the home in the world and clicking on its door. Previewing brings you into a personal experience where you can explore the prospective home, including both furnished and unfurnished versions.\nThe Housing Editor.\nThe housing editor contains multiple tabs and categories for ease of asset selection.\nHome Decoration.\nFurnishings are a new kind of inventory item that may be placed in a home, and can be identified by the word \"Furnishing\" on their tooltip. These function like any other inventory item until it is time to place them in a home.\nSpecialty Furnishings.\nMany types of housing objects have additional functionality when placed, including the following:\nFurnishing Sourcing.\nHome furnishings can be found from a number of sources, including:\nFurnishing Crafting.\nYou can now craft furnishings for yourself, your friends, or to sell to others!\nHousing Achievements.\nIn Homestead, you can expect to see a variety of new &lt;a href=\"Achievements%20%28Online%29/Housing\"&gt;achievements&lt;/a&gt; for everything from decorating your home in a certain way, to learning an impressive number of furniture plans, to beating up Target Skeletons.

The fate of the island of &lt;a href=\"Vvardenfell%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Vvardenfell&lt;/a&gt; hangs in the balance and &lt;a href=\"Tamriel\"&gt;Tamriel&lt;/a&gt; needs a hero to help &lt;a href=\"Vivec%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Vivec&lt;/a&gt;, the legendary warrior-poet god, who suffers from a mysterious illness.\nIn addition to Vvardenfell, the largest landmass addition to date, we're also introducing the first new &lt;a href=\"Classes%20%28Online%29\"&gt;class&lt;/a&gt; since ESO launched: the &lt;a href=\"Warden\"&gt;Warden&lt;/a&gt;. This class is an adaptable, support-orientated option for players who want to be able to fill a specific role while simultaneously providing assistance to others. If you are interested in a class that uses the wilds of Tamriel to &lt;a href=\"Tank%20%28Role%29\"&gt;protect&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Healers%20%28Online%29\"&gt;heal&lt;/a&gt;, or deal damage (occasionally all at the same time) the Warden is for you.\nMorrowind also brings a new &lt;a href=\"PvP\"&gt;PvP&lt;/a&gt; mode \u2013 &lt;a href=\"Battlegrounds\"&gt;Battlegrounds&lt;/a&gt; \u2013 which are small-scale, fast-paced battles with three teams of four players. If you're looking for a real challenge, head to our newest 12-player &lt;a href=\"Trial\"&gt;Trial&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Halls%20of%20Fabrication\"&gt;Halls of Fabrication&lt;/a&gt;, featuring a Normal and Veteran version. You'll also find a host of new &lt;a href=\"item%20sets\"&gt;item sets&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Motifs\"&gt;Motifs&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Housing%20%28Online%29\"&gt;homes&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"furnishings\"&gt;furnishings&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"collectibles\"&gt;collectibles&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Titles%20%28Online%29\"&gt;titles&lt;/a&gt;, and even &lt;a href=\"dyes\"&gt;dyes&lt;/a&gt;.\nBut that's not all! The base game brings many new updates as well including updates to the &lt;a href=\"Champion%20System\"&gt;Champion System&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"Master%20Writ\"&gt;Master Writ&lt;/a&gt; Merchant, &lt;a href=\"Cyrodiil%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Cyrodiil&lt;/a&gt; Rewards, a new Inverse Kinematic System, and more. And as always, we have a number of &lt;a href=\"Bugs%20%28Online%29\"&gt;bug&lt;/a&gt; fixes and general improvements to the overall game. The size of this update is approximately 8.71GB. Enjoy our first chapter - Morrowind!\nMorrowind.\nTravel to the volcanic island of Vvardenfell and explore a land of &lt;a href=\"Dunmer%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Dark Elves&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Tribunal%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Living Gods&lt;/a&gt;, and bizarre creatures as adventurers from every alliance answer Lord Vivec's call.

Wander the harsh landscape as an emissary for Lord Vivec, performing missions for the &lt;a href=\"Great%20Houses\"&gt;Great Houses&lt;/a&gt;, delving into mysterious ruins, and meeting unique challenges head-on in the shadow of the rumbling &lt;a href=\"Red%20Mountain\"&gt;Red Mountain&lt;/a&gt;. The fate of Morrowind rests in your hands!\nUpgrading to Morrowind.\nEveryone who logs into ESO who has not yet upgraded to Morrowind will see a registration screen that will notify you that Morrowind is available, and will give you instructions for upgrading the base game to Morrowind via a simple digital upgrade purchase. This screen is also the main interface for entering retail Morrowind codes \u2013 anyone who has purchased Morrowind new at retail (starting June 6) will use this screen to register their purchase by entering the code included in their physical retail box.\nAdditionally, we've added a notification and UI button at the bottom of the character select screen that will bring you back to this registration screen when you wish to upgrade.\nNew Public Dungeons.\nTwo new &lt;a href=\"public%20dungeons\"&gt;public dungeons&lt;/a&gt; are available for you to explore in Morrowind.\nNew Playable Class: The Warden.\nWardens have a strong set of abilities focused on supporting their allies, but they can also focus their skill selection and morphs on solo combat. If you like to take hits, deal damage, or heal, this class is for you. Wardens are able to summon icy barriers to protect their allies, sprout healing plants to restore them, and command a savage &lt;a href=\"Bear%20%28Online%29\"&gt;grizzly&lt;/a&gt; to attack their enemies. This versatile class uses the power of &lt;a href=\"Y%27ffre\"&gt;Y'ffre&lt;/a&gt;'s blessing to help deal with any situation.

Large groups cannot queue for Battlegrounds.\nBattleground matches last a maximum of 15 minutes, but can end early if the maximum score is reached. Game modes currently have a maximum score of 500 points.\nLeaving a Battleground before the match is over will incur a penalty.\nNew Homes.\nThree new &lt;a href=\"Housing%20%28Online%29\"&gt;properties&lt;/a&gt; are now available to move into in Morrowind.\nNew Furnishings and Furnishing Plans.\nMany new &lt;a href=\"Furnishing%20Plans\"&gt;Furnishing Plans&lt;/a&gt; can be found across Vvardenfell in &lt;a href=\"Containers%20%28Online%29\"&gt;trunks, backpacks, and other common sources&lt;/a&gt; for recipes and plans. While they will only appear in Vvardenfell, they can be traded freely or sold on &lt;a href=\"Guild%20Trader\"&gt;Guild Trader&lt;/a&gt;s.\nNew Collectibles.\nA cornucopia of new &lt;a href=\"collectibles\"&gt;collectibles&lt;/a&gt; awaits the avid adventurer in Morrowind.

Whether you choose to make your name on the isle of Vvardenfell, in &lt;a href=\"Sotha%20Sil%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Sotha Sil's&lt;/a&gt; Halls of Fabrication, or in the high-intensity combat of Battleground matches, you can proudly display your accomplishments with one of 21 new &lt;a href=\"Titles%20%28Online%29\"&gt;titles&lt;/a&gt; (unlisted to avoid spoilers!)\nNew Features / Updates / Big Changes.\nSkill Line Unlocking.\n&lt;a href=\"Character%20Creation%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Newly-created characters&lt;/a&gt; will now have all &lt;a href=\"Skills%20%28Online%29\"&gt;skill&lt;/a&gt; lines hidden except for the 3 from their class, the goal being to improve a new player's experience by reducing the initial number of skill line choices to a more manageable number.\nAdjusted Experience (XP) for Levels 1 \u2013 50.\nThe &lt;a href=\"experience\"&gt;experience&lt;/a&gt; needed to level from 1 to 50 has been adjusted. Earlier levels now require less experience to obtain, while later levels will require more.\nMaster Writ Merchant Update.\n&lt;a href=\"Rolis%20Hlaalu\"&gt;Rolis Hlaalu&lt;/a&gt;, the Master Mediator, has expanded his inventory. He now sells plans for two &lt;a href=\"Target%20Centurion\"&gt;Target Centurion&lt;/a&gt;s suitable for evaluating the DPS of an entire Trial group, as well as two separate tiers of Furnisher's Documents.\nThe \"&lt;a href=\"Target%20Centurion%2C%20Dwarf-Brass\"&gt;Target Centurion, Dwarf-Brass&lt;/a&gt;\" is a little tougher than the Veteran &lt;a href=\"Yokeda%20Kai\"&gt;Yokeda Kai&lt;/a&gt; from &lt;a href=\"Hel%20Ra%20Citadel\"&gt;Hel Ra Citadel&lt;/a&gt;, with nearly 26 million health. In addition to learning the praxis, this requires four &lt;a href=\"Animus%20Stone\"&gt;Animus Stone&lt;/a&gt;s as well as 12 &lt;a href=\"Dwarven%20Construct%20Repair%20Parts\"&gt;Dwarven Construct Repair Parts&lt;/a&gt;, which can be found as weekly rewards from the Halls of Fabrication or acquired from other players.\nNormal Mode Dungeon Trophies.\nIf you've ever wanted to display the head of a &lt;a href=\"Daedric%20Titan%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Daedric Titan&lt;/a&gt; on a wall in your home, you're in luck! The &lt;a href=\"Undaunted\"&gt;Undaunted&lt;/a&gt; have started taking trophies home to memorialize their kills, and you are encouraged to do the same.\nNew Hireling Mails.\nEach &lt;a href=\"hireling\"&gt;hireling&lt;/a&gt; skill now has roughly 100 more unique &lt;a href=\"Mail\"&gt;messages&lt;/a&gt;, telling a brand new set of stories. These will start to appear after you've exhausted the current pool of messages.\nPvP Campaign Updates.\nAll current &lt;a href=\"Campaigns%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Campaigns&lt;/a&gt; have shut down, and new ones (listed below) are opening in their stead! We are doing this to give everyone a chance to re-plant their flags and find new homes to flex their &lt;a href=\"Alliance\"&gt;Alliance&lt;/a&gt; mettle. Campaigns that are being shut down will award players based on the Leaderboard and score status at the time of shut down. All players will be granted free &lt;a href=\"Home%20Campaign\"&gt;Home&lt;/a&gt; assignments as well.\nCyrodiil Reward Updates.\nWe've updated the &lt;a href=\"Cyrodiil%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Cyrodiil&lt;/a&gt; Leaderboards rewards! Now, you will receive &lt;a href=\"Jewelry%20%28Online%29\"&gt;jewelry&lt;/a&gt; from the &lt;a href=\"item%20sets\"&gt;item sets&lt;/a&gt; listed below for placing on the leaderboard, or for your Alliance being in first place.\nNew ESO Plus Benefit: Double Bank Capacity.\n&lt;a href=\"ESO%20Plus\"&gt;ESO Plus&lt;/a&gt; members will now automatically receive twice the &lt;a href=\"Banks%20%28Online%29\"&gt;banking&lt;/a&gt; inventory slots. This includes both the base banking capacity as well as all bank slot upgrades purchased from &lt;a href=\"Bankers\"&gt;Bankers&lt;/a&gt; or the &lt;a href=\"Crown%20Store\"&gt;Crown Store&lt;/a&gt;. That means 20 additional slots per upgrade instead of 10!\nAdditional Purchasable Character Slots.\nWith the release of Morrowind and the &lt;a href=\"Warden\"&gt;Warden&lt;/a&gt; class, we've added two more character slots up for sale in the Crown Store. This brings the new maximum character count to 14!\nInverse Kinematic System.\nThe Inverse Kinematic (IK) System is a new feature in development that helps position your character's feet more naturally on the terrain.\nMiscellaneous UI Updates.\nWe've added several new features and options, called out below, that will better improve your UI experience.\nDark Brotherhood Fixes and Improvements.\nArt and Animation.\nFigure\nExploration &amp; Itemization.\nGeneral\nUI.\nGeneral\nImperial City Fixes &amp; Improvements.\nExploration &amp; Itemization.\nGeneral\nUI.\nGeneral\nThieves Guild Fixes &amp; Improvements.\nDungeons &amp; Group Content.\n&lt;a href=\"Maw%20of%20Lorkhaj\"&gt;Maw of Lorkhaj&lt;/a&gt; Trial\nFixes and Improvements.\n&lt;a href=\"Alliance%20War\"&gt;Alliance War&lt;/a&gt;.\nGeneral\nCombat &amp; Gameplay.\nResource Recovery Changes.\n&lt;a href=\"Combat%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Combat&lt;/a&gt; in ESO is, and has always been, about fast-paced action where &lt;a href=\"Attributes%20%28Online%29\"&gt;resource&lt;/a&gt; management plays a large part in performing effectively. Player abilities in ESO specifically do not have &lt;a href=\"cooldown\"&gt;cooldown&lt;/a&gt;s for this very reason - resource management is key and is a core pillar of the system. Due to the number of balance changes we have made over time, this core pillar of resource management has become minimzed; it's become easier than ever to have high sustainability while still being fully maximized for damage.\nAs such, some significant changes to resource recovery are being made. In general, each of the changes falls into one of four major categories:\nGeneral.\nSecond, we want to speed up some of the slowest Heavy Attacks while also increasing the amount of resources all Heavy Attacks restore. This should improve the combat feel of winding up some of the slower Heavy Attacks, while also allowing all builds to restore their resources faster and with less Heavy Attacks needed.\"\nDragonknight.\n&lt;a href=\"Ardent%20Flame\"&gt;Ardent Flame&lt;/a&gt;:\n&lt;a href=\"Draconic%20Power\"&gt;Draconic Power&lt;/a&gt;:\n&lt;a href=\"Earthen%20Heart\"&gt;Earthen Heart&lt;/a&gt;\nNightblade.\n&lt;a href=\"Assassination\"&gt;Assassination&lt;/a&gt;:\nDeveloper Comments:\n\"Allowing you to fire multiple Assassin's Will procs from a single cast of Grim Focus should streamline the ability usage by eliminating the need to recast it early. We've increased the amount of attacks needed to obtain a proc slightly, but the net result should be an increase in Nightblade DPS with the extra global cooldowns.\"\n&lt;a href=\"Shadow%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Shadow&lt;/a&gt;:\n&lt;a href=\"Siphoning\"&gt;Siphoning&lt;/a&gt;:\nSorcerer.\n&lt;a href=\"Dark%20Magic\"&gt;Dark Magic&lt;/a&gt;:\n&lt;a href=\"Daedric%20Summoning\"&gt;Daedric Summoning&lt;/a&gt;:\nTemplar.\nSecond, we wanted to lower the damage gap between the Luminous Shards and Blazing Spear morph choices. Blazing Spear is still ideal for raw damage, but it is no longer such a prominent difference; you won't feel as penalized if you want to sacrifice some damage to have better group utility.\nFinally, we've buffed the Luminous Shard synergy to return more resources. While this synergy will share a cooldown with Necrotic Orb, it allows Templars to have a more distinct version of the synergy without making it mandatory in end-game group content.\"\n&lt;a href=\"Dawn%27s%20Wrath\"&gt;Dawn's Wrath&lt;/a&gt;:\n&lt;a href=\"Restoring%20Light\"&gt;Restoring Light&lt;/a&gt;:\nDeveloper Comments:\nWeapon.\nDestruction Staff.\nDeveloper Comments:\nChampion System.\nThe Steed.\n&lt;a href=\"Ironclad\"&gt;Ironclad&lt;/a&gt;:\nMonsters.\nThe following critters no longer have any collision:\n&lt;a href=\"Assassin%20Beetle%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Assassin Beetle&lt;/a&gt;\n&lt;a href=\"Watcher\"&gt;Watcher&lt;/a&gt;:\nCrafting &amp; Economy.\nProvisioning.\nWoodworking.\nIncreased the drop rate for the \"Dunmer Chair, Angled\" blueprint to align it with the drop rates compared to other green Dunmer blueprints.\nDungeons &amp; Group Content.\nGeneral.\nYou now get the same amount of reputation from any pledge that awards a single &lt;a href=\"Undaunted%20Key\"&gt;Undaunted Key&lt;/a&gt;, regardless of whether it was completed on Normal or Veteran difficulty.\nDungeons &amp; Trials.\nItem Sets.\nDeveloper Comments:\n\"These sets are meant to be damage or healing focused by augmenting a particular element or skill line, so the 2-piece bonus of Max Health was out of place for this theme. We've updated them to have more appropriate 2-piece bonuses instead.\"\nDeveloper Comments:\nDeveloper Comments:\nHousing.\nHomes.\nFixed an issue where the &lt;a href=\"House%20of%20the%20Silent%20Magnifico\"&gt;House of the Silent Magnifico&lt;/a&gt; would occasionally direct you to complete the \"&lt;a href=\"A%20Friend%20In%20Need\"&gt;A Friend in Need&lt;/a&gt;\" quest to purchase the house with gold, even after you completed the quest on that character.\nUI.\nAlliance War.\nFixed an issue where the &lt;a href=\"Keeps\"&gt;Keep&lt;/a&gt; Information panel could get stuck on your screen after leaving the &lt;a href=\"Cyrodiil%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Cyrodiil&lt;/a&gt; map.\nBank.\nFixed an issue where splitting a stack in the &lt;a href=\"Banks%20%28Online%29\"&gt;bank&lt;/a&gt; could sometimes incorrectly show a \"Bank is full\" error message."}

It will grant a new combat function, and will be an interesting choice for builds seeking to maximize resource recovery gains. Pairing the &lt;a href=\"Divines\"&gt;Divines&lt;/a&gt; trait with a recovery Mundus Stone will grant more recovery for that one particular stat, but Prosperous will grant more recovery overall.\"\n\"Item Sets\"\nDeveloper Comments \u2013 \"Proc Set\" changes and &lt;a href=\"Monster%20Mask\"&gt;Monster Mask&lt;/a&gt; balance: \"Item Sets have received two major rebalancing efforts this update with a focus on introducing more counterplay to certain Item Set procs and improving diversity in Monster Mask choices.\"\n\"To introduce more counterplay to certain Item Set procs, we've changed the method in which they deal damage. While we are happy with the current damage values of these Item Sets, having them deliver that damage in unavoidable bursts has led to an unsatisfying &lt;a href=\"PvP\"&gt;PvP&lt;/a&gt; experience. The procs of these Item Sets now have unique mechanics to delay their damage, along with accompanying visual effects to allow more time to react to them.\"\n\"To go hand-in-hand with the release of two new Monster Mask Item Sets, we've rebalanced most of the older Monster Masks. To ensure that every Monster Mask conforms to similar Damage, Healing, and Survivability standards, most Monster Masks were brought up in power though a few were adjusted slightly downward.\"\n\"The bonus for having 5 pieces is approximately 2.31x the value of a one-piece bonus. For example, you can get a set bonus of 129 Spell Damage, or a 5-piece bonus of 299 Spell Damage on &lt;a href=\"Law%20of%20Julianos\"&gt;Julianos&lt;/a&gt;.\"\n\"Some sets, such as &lt;a href=\"Necropotence\"&gt;Necropotence&lt;/a&gt;, have conditional bonuses. Since it's harder to get these bonuses, we are allowing them to provide up to a 25% increase over other sets. This is why now gives 2540 max resource and Necropotence now gives 3150.\"\nItemization Fixes &amp; Improvements.\n\"Item Sets\"\n\"Traits\"\nBase Game.\nFixes &amp; Improvements.\nAlliance War &amp; PvP.\n\"General\"\nArt &amp; Animation.\n\"General\"\n\"Animation\"\n\"Figure\"\nAudio.\n\"General\"\nCrafting &amp; Economy.\n\"General\"\n\"Crafting Motifs\"\n\"&lt;a href=\"Crafting%20Writs\"&gt;Crafting Writs&lt;/a&gt;\"\n\"&lt;a href=\"Enchanting%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Enchanting&lt;/a&gt;\"\n\"&lt;a href=\"Furnishings%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Furnishings&lt;/a&gt;\"\n\"&lt;a href=\"Master%20Writs\"&gt;Master Writs&lt;/a&gt;\"\n\"&lt;a href=\"Provisioning\"&gt;Provisioning&lt;/a&gt;\"\n\"&lt;a href=\"Survey%20Reports\"&gt;Survey Reports&lt;/a&gt;\"\nCrown Store &amp; Crown Crates.\n\"Art &amp; Animations\"\n\"&lt;a href=\"Costumes\"&gt;Costumes&lt;/a&gt;\"\n\"Furnishings\"\n\"Motifs\"\n\"Pets &amp; &lt;a href=\"Mounts%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Mounts&lt;/a&gt;\"\nDungeons &amp; Group Content.\n\"Dungeons\"\n\"&lt;a href=\"Trials\"&gt;Trials&lt;/a&gt;\"\nExploration &amp; Itemization.\n\"Dungeons &amp; Trials\"\n\"&lt;a href=\"Mementos\"&gt;Mementos&lt;/a&gt;\"\n\"&lt;a href=\"Eidetic%20Memory\"&gt;Eidetic Memory&lt;/a&gt;\"\nHousing.\n\"Furnishings\"\n\"&lt;a href=\"Housing%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Homes&lt;/a&gt;\"\nJustice System.\n\"General\"\n\"Furnishings\"\nMiscellaneous.\n\"General\"\nQuests &amp; Zones.\n\"&lt;a href=\"Auridon\"&gt;Auridon&lt;/a&gt;\"\n\"&lt;a href=\"Bangkorai\"&gt;Bangkorai&lt;/a&gt;\"\n\"&lt;a href=\"Craglorn\"&gt;Craglorn&lt;/a&gt;\"\n\"&lt;a href=\"Deshaan%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Deshaan&lt;/a&gt;\"\n\"&lt;a href=\"Eastmarch%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Eastmarch&lt;/a&gt;\"\n\"&lt;a href=\"Glenumbra%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Glenumbra&lt;/a&gt;\"\n\"&lt;a href=\"Greenshade\"&gt;Greenshade&lt;/a&gt;\"\n\"&lt;a href=\"Khenarthi%27s%20Roost\"&gt;Khenarthi's Roost&lt;/a&gt;\"\n\"&lt;a href=\"Main%20Quest%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Main Quest&lt;/a&gt;\"\n\"&lt;a href=\"Stonefalls%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Stonefalls&lt;/a&gt;\"\nUI.\n\"General\"\n\"Crafting\"\n\"&lt;a href=\"Crown%20Store\"&gt;Crown Store&lt;/a&gt;\"\n\"Gamepad Mode\"\n\"Gameplay\"\n\"Guilds &amp; Guild Stores\"\n\"Help &amp; &lt;a href=\"Tutorials\"&gt;Tutorials&lt;/a&gt;\"\n\"Housing &amp; Furnishings\"\n\"Maps\"\n\"&lt;a href=\"Quests%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Quests&lt;/a&gt;\""}

The machine world is rife with frightening and alien dangers lurking beneath its metallic deserts and artificial trees, where only tiny pockets of citizens are able to carve out a quasi\u2013religious society that values enlightenment and experimentation in emulation of its detached benefactor. A dark conspiracy threatens the integrity of the Clockwork City, and signs of a powerful &lt;a href=\"Daedra%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Daedric&lt;/a&gt; relic manifesting within that realm draw all interested eyes toward Sotha Sil's domain.\nThe Brass Fortress.\nGoing to the Clockwork City will eventually lead you to the &lt;a href=\"Brass%20Fortress\"&gt;Brass Fortress&lt;/a&gt;, the center of the city itself and the one place that the &lt;a href=\"Clockwork%20Apostles\"&gt;Clockwork Apostles&lt;/a&gt;, dedicated priests and inventors, work to improve their bodies and minds \u2013 sometimes with dubious \"replacement\" parts! Here, you can find the usual services and commodities.\nNew World Bosses and Delves.\nThe Clockwork City is a treacherous place with dangers both native and invasive.\nNew Sites to Explore.\nTwo full quest objectives exist in the wilderness of the Clockwork City for you to explore.\nNew Trial: Asylum Sanctorium.\nSotha Sil, always seeking knowledge, used three Dunmer &lt;a href=\"saints\"&gt;saints&lt;/a&gt; in his earliest experiments into everlasting life. Using the power of &lt;a href=\"Soul%20Gem%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Soul Gems&lt;/a&gt;, he created mechanical vessels for the saints and imprisoned their souls within. While the experiment was successful, the Saints were driven insane by the process. The &lt;a href=\"Asylum%20Sanctorium\"&gt;Asylum Sanctorium&lt;/a&gt; was created to house the Saints so that they would not threaten the rest of the Clockwork City. The Saints have grown in power during their imprisonment and now threaten to break free of their prison. The time has come to end the threat they pose.\nAsylum &amp; Perfect Asylum Weapons.\nMuch as the Master's and Maelstrom's weapons before, the Asylum and Perfect Asylum weapons alter and improve the effect of one of your weapon skill line's abilities. Perfect Asylum weapons have the same benefit as the imperfect Asylum weapons, but at a greater magnitude. Perfect Asylum weapons are available only for those intrepid heroes who can conquer the hardest battle available in Asylum Sanctorium \u2013 &lt;a href=\"St.%20Olms\"&gt;St. Olms&lt;/a&gt;, and both of his allies, fighting alongside one another.\nFor a full list of the Asylum weapons, please see the New Item Sets section a bit further down.\nAsylum Sanctorium Itemization.\nIn Asylum Sanctorium, you can obtain rewards based on not only the Trial's difficulty (Normal or Veteran), but also on how many allies the boss, St. Olms, has with him.\nNew Collectibles.\nWe've added many new Collectibles that are available to earn from the Clockwork City area and content.\nNew Item Sets.\nThere are 12 new Item Sets available from a variety of sources: 3 Item Sets available at crafting stations in Clockwork City, 3 Item Sets available as drops throughout Clockwork City, and 6 Item Sets available as drops in the new Trial, Asylum Sanctorium. Below is a list of all new item sets, with values being for a full set of gold-quality, &lt;a href=\"CP\"&gt;CP&lt;/a&gt;160 gear:\nNew Target Dummy: The Precursor.\n&lt;a href=\"Associate%20Zanon\"&gt;Associate Zanon&lt;/a&gt; of the Clockwork Apostles is near to completing his study of Factotum construction, and has made a fascinating discovery in his research. After finding a discarded Factotum head in a junk pile, he was alarmed to discover that it could still speak! If you respond to Zanon's posting on the board within the Brass Fortress, you may assist him in reassembling this unique construct and discovering its true purpose.\nNew Motifs.\nTwo motifs have been added to Clockwork City:\nNew Furnishings.\nOver 200 new furnishings have been added to the game through various sources, many of which can be purchased through the Housing Editor or crafted. The associated &lt;a href=\"Furnishing%20recipes\"&gt;recipes&lt;/a&gt; and additional furnishings can be found throughout Clockwork City, with sourcing including everything from &lt;a href=\"Justice%20System\"&gt;Justice&lt;/a&gt; activities and monster drops, to various &lt;a href=\"Containers%20%28Online%29\"&gt;containers&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Merchants%20%28Online%29\"&gt;merchants&lt;/a&gt;. These furnishings include precision tools and small pieces of machinery from Justice activities, as well as obsolete Factotum parts from Factotum enemies.\nNew Achievements.\nClockwork City comes with over 40 new &lt;a href=\"Achievements%20%28Clockwork%20City%29\"&gt;achievements&lt;/a&gt; to pursue, with 6 new &lt;a href=\"Titles%20%28Online%29\"&gt;titles&lt;/a&gt; to unlock!\nMorrowind.\nNew Battleground Game Mode: Crazy King.\nCrazy King is a new game mode that is similar to &lt;a href=\"Domination%20%28Battlegrounds%29\"&gt;Domination&lt;/a&gt;, but a bit more frantic\u2026or crazy, if you will! \nHorns of the Reach.\nNew Motifs.\nTwo &lt;a href=\"motifs\"&gt;motifs&lt;/a&gt; have been added to the &lt;a href=\"Horns%20of%20the%20Reach\"&gt;Horns of the Reach&lt;/a&gt; DLC game pack, in conjunction with two new motif achievements.\nBase Game Update.\nTransmutation.\nA new way of altering your equipment is available in this update. Transmutation allows you to permanently change the trait of an item to one of your choosing! The requirements to utilize Transmutation is as follows:\nTrait Tracker.\nAlong with the ability to change traits, equipment tooltips now have an icon next to the trait that communicates the trait's status:\nPerformance Updates.\nIn this update, we've been hard at work improving the performance of the client. We've overhauled how the client handles animations, significantly reducing memory requirements. Additionally, we've made significant optimizations to the Scene Graph. Together, these two additions have resulted in significant gains in frame rate and improved load times into areas with many characters and/or buildings, including in &lt;a href=\"Cyrodiil%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Cyrodiil&lt;/a&gt;.\nCrafting Writ Turn\u2013In Site Universalization.\nWith the Clockwork City base game update, you may now turn in your &lt;a href=\"Crafting%20Writs\"&gt;Crafting Writs&lt;/a&gt; at any Writ turn-in site throughout the world, regardless of crafting rank.\nNew Home.\n&lt;a href=\"The%20Orbservatory%20Prior\"&gt;The Orbservatory Prior&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Homestead%20%28Online%29\"&gt;home&lt;/a&gt; is available to preview and purchase.

As with previous updates, the base game patch will be available to everyone who owns \"The Elder Scrolls Online\" and the DLC Game Pack will automatically download with it, allowing you instant access to the new content when you purchase it or activate an ESO Plus membership. Anyone who owns ESO and has an active ESO Plus membership will also automatically have access to the Dragon Bones DLC Game Pack. If your ESO Plus membership ends or lapses, you will no longer have access to the DLC Game Pack content and areas, but you will still have any items you earned while you had access.\nIn this update, you\u2019ll be able to explore and conquer two all-new 4 player dungeons \u2013 &lt;a href=\"Fang%20Lair%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Fang Lair&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Scalecaller%20Peak\"&gt;Scalecaller Peak&lt;/a&gt;. These dungeons offer new item sets, Monster Masks, achievements and unique rewards! We\u2019ve also added two new Battlegrounds maps \u2013 &lt;a href=\"Mor%20Khazgur%20%28Online%20Battleground%29\"&gt;Mor Khazgur&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Deeping%20Drome\"&gt;Deeping Drome&lt;/a&gt; \u2013 which are available to anyone who owns The Elder Scrolls Online: Morrowind.\nIn the base game patch, we\u2019ve added several new features including the highly-anticipated Outfit System, which gives you the freedom to customize the visual appearance of your gear, and Home Storage Furnishings! We\u2019ve also added two new systems to aid players as they adventure throughout Tamriel: a Level Up Advisor and Skills Advisor. And as always, we\u2019ve made several adjustments and improvements to combat abilities, including an overhaul to our Synergy system, and several bug fixes.\nWe hope you enjoy this new update, which is approximately 2.38GB in size.\nNew Features/Updates/Big Changes.\nDragon Bones DLC.\nNew Item Sets.\nThere are 8 new Item Sets available from the two dungeons, Scalecaller Peak and Fang Lair. Each dungeon has 1 Light Armor, 1 Medium Armor, 1 Heavy Armor, and 1 Monster Mask Item Set to acquire.\nNew Achievements.\nDragon Bones comes with more than 35 new achievements, including 4 new titles to unlock. Complete both dungeons on Veteran difficulty to unlock the Nacreous Purple dye!\nMorrowind.\nBattlegrounds.\nTwo new maps have been added for Battlegrounds.\nBase Game Updates.\nOutfits.\nThe new Outfit System is now available, and allows you the freedom to customize the visual appearance of your character including both the style and dyes. With Outfits, you get to determine the appearance of every aspect of your character, piece by piece, regardless of what you are (or aren't) wearing underneath.\nHome Storage Furnishings.\nWe\u2019re pleased to introduce a new form of collectible \u2013 storage furnishings! These account-wide items allow you to store 30 or 60 items per collectible, depending on the size. You can acquire four 30-slot coffers and four 60-slot chests, for a combined total of up to 360 storage slots. All four coffers share the same visual appearance, but each has a unique name and can be nicknamed for easy organization. Chests work the same way, with their own shared appearance.\nMaster Writ Updates.\n&lt;a href=\"Rolis%20Hlaalu\"&gt;Rolis Hlaalu&lt;/a&gt;, the Mastercraft Mediator who sells &lt;a href=\"Furnishings%20%28Online%29\"&gt;furnishings&lt;/a&gt; and recipes for Writ Vouchers, has changed some of his offerings. He retired several of his furniture plans and now offers 6 new furniture plans. Visit him to see what he is selling.\nAdditionally, Rolis Hlaalu has a new assistant: &lt;a href=\"Faustina%20Curio\"&gt;Faustina Curio&lt;/a&gt;, the Achievement Mediator. This new merchant sells plans and furnishings for Writ Vouchers to characters that have attained certain achievements. Among these items are plans that Rolis previously stopped selling, as well as new furnishing documents that contain Morrowind furnishing plans. You can find Faustina Curio right next to Rolis Hlaalu, at the Writ drop-off area.\nLevel Up Advisor.\nThis new system is designed to teach new players about the many facets of combat and progression in ESO. It contains useful rewards for new and veteran players alike as you progress from levels 2-50, and every five levels, you will receive a milestone reward with something special such as a mount, Crown Crate, costume, or a helpful weapon. Simply open the Character UI to claim your rewards! Below, you\u2019ll find the list of milestone rewards:\nSkills Advisor.\nThis new system makes recommendations on how to spend skill points based on the build you select. You can use this system to mold your character as you\u2019re leveling up, or to help you re-specialize your build after reaching max level. To support this system, we\u2019ve made some adjustments in the UI:\nChampion Point Increase.\nThe Champion Point cap has been raised by 30 points (10 in each red/blue/green constellation) for a total of 720 Champion Points. The Champion Point experience curve has been automatically adjusted with this new cap so earlier Champion Points require less experience and can be earned faster.\n32-bit Client Removal.\nWe are no longer supporting the 32-bit client due to there being significant memory limitations with a 32-bit client, in conjunction with having the minimum system requirement of 3GB RAM. If you\u2019re running a 32-bit version of Windows, you\u2019ll need to upgrade to Windows 64-bit Operating System to continue playing ESO.\nClockwork City.\nFixes and Improvements.\nArt and Animation.\nGeneral\nFigure\nAudio.\nGeneral\nCombat and Gameplay.\nMonster Abilities\nQuests and Zones.\nGeneral\nQuests\nDark Brotherhood.\nFixes and Improvements.\nArt and Animation.\nFigure\nCombat and Gameplay.\nMonsters\nHorns of the Reach.\nFixes and Improvements.\nDungeons and Group Content.\nDungeons\nImperial City.\nFixes and Improvements.\nCrafting and Economy.\nCrafting Motifs\nUI.\nGeneral\nMorrowind.\nFixes and Improvements.\nAlliance War and PVP.\nBattlegrounds\nArt and Animation.\nGeneral\nAudio.\nGeneral\nCombat and Gameplay.\nWarden, Balance Changes\nWarden, Bug Fixes\nExploration and Itemization.\nGeneral\nEidetic Memory\nQuests and Zones.\nQuests\nOrsinium.\nFixes and Improvements.\nArt and Animation.\nAnimation\nDungeons and Group Content.\nMaelstrom Arena\nQuests and Zones.\nQuests\nThieves Guild.\nFixes and Improvements.\nExploration and Itemization.\nEidetic Memory\nMaw of Lorkhaj\nQuests and Zones.\nQuests\nCombat and Gameplay.\nCombat Balance.\nGeneral\nCast Time &amp; Interrupts\nDeveloper Comments \u2013 Cast Time and Interrupt Changes: We've updated the rules for interrupting cast time abilities to provide a better opportunity for you to successfully cast them, and clear counterplay for enemies to interrupt them. Reducing the Movement Speed penalty allows you to more easily position yourself while casting, and makes those abilities more fluid with the fast pace of combat. Allowing crowd control immunity to also grant interrupt immunity removes the gameplay loop of trying to cast an ability and having it be interrupted repeatedly. The 3 second lockout period gives you a chance to capitalize on a crucial interrupt without allowing the enemy to simply immediately recast the ability you just interrupted.\nSynergies\nDeveloper Comments \u2013 Synergy Updates: The global changes to synergies will result in them being more responsive and more rewarding to use. We've updated and fixed numerous bugs for obtaining the synergy prompt, and took synergies off the global cooldown so that you can immediately use them as soon as you see that prompt. Synergies now all have a distinct visual effect to clearly communicate where and when a synergy is available. Finally, many synergies were significantly buffed to ensure that it always feels worth it to use them, which you can read more about below.\nBlock Costs\nDeveloper Comments - Block Cost Changes: The changes to Block's costs are meant to reduce the extreme differences between builds that specialize in blocking and ones that do not. We've lowered the base cost of Block to ensure that all builds can have an easier time blocking attacks without being completely drained of Stamina. We've also changed Block cost jewelry enchantments to work similarly to Magicka or Stamina cost reduction jewelry enchantments. Builds utilizing those enchantments (and other reductions to Block cost) were too effective at keeping block up. Finally, we've buffed Ancient Knowledge so that it is comparable to the Fortress passive, which brings the gap between traditional Sword and Shield tanking and Frost Staff tanking closer.\nHeavy Attacks &amp; Off Balance\nBlock &amp; Dodge Rulesets\nDragonknight\nNightblade\nTemplar\nWeapon\nWorld\nAlliance War\nCombat Fixes and Improvements.\nGeneral\nDragonknight\nNightblade\nTemplar\nWeapon\nArmor\nAlliance War\nRacial\nChampion System\nItemization Balance.\nItem Sets\nItemization Fixes and Improvements.\nGeneral\nItem Sets\nBase Game.\nFixes and Improvements.\nAlliance War and PVP.\nGeneral\nItemization\nArt and Animation.\nGeneral\nAnimation\nFigure\nFixtures\nCombat and Gameplay.\nMonsters\nMonster Abilities\nCrafting and Economy.\nAlchemy\nBlacksmithing\nCollectibles\nConsumables\nCrafting Motifs\nTransmutation\nCrown Store and Crown Crates.\nGeneral\nArt\nCollectibles\nConsumables\nPersonalities\nDungeons and Group Content.\nDungeons\nExploration and Itemization.\nGeneral\nCollectibles\nEidetic Memory\nSurvey Reports\nHousing.\nFurnishings\nHomes\nItemization\nMiscellaneous.\nGeneral\nQuests and Zones.\n&lt;a href=\"Alik%27r%20Desert%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Alik'r Desert&lt;/a&gt; \n&lt;a href=\"Auridon\"&gt;Auridon&lt;/a&gt;\n&lt;a href=\"Bangkorai\"&gt;Bangkorai&lt;/a&gt;\nCraglorn\n&lt;a href=\"Fighters%20Guild%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Fighters Guild&lt;/a&gt;\n&lt;a href=\"Grahtwood\"&gt;Grahtwood&lt;/a&gt;\n&lt;a href=\"Khenarthi%27s%20Roost\"&gt;Khenarthi's Roost&lt;/a&gt;\n&lt;a href=\"Main%20Quest%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Main Quest&lt;/a&gt;\n&lt;a href=\"Stonefalls%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Stonefalls&lt;/a&gt;\n&lt;a href=\"Stros%20M%27Kai%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Stros M'Kai&lt;/a&gt; \nUI.\nGeneral\nAddons\nCollectibles\nCrafting\nCrown Store\nGamepad Mode\nGameplay\nGuilds &amp; Guild Features\nQuests\nTutorials &amp; Tooltips"}

From the ports of &lt;a href=\"Shimmerene%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Shimmerene&lt;/a&gt; to the throne city of &lt;a href=\"Alinor%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Alinor&lt;/a&gt;, all of Summerset stretches before newcomers, providing endless opportunities for exploration and adventure. But not all High Elves agree with the royal decree. Worse, other threats arise during this period of change, including strange geysers, invading forces, and dangerous &lt;a href=\"Court%20of%20Bedlam\"&gt;cultists&lt;/a&gt; that seek to overturn Altmer society. Summerset needs heroes. Are you ready to take up the challenge?\n is a new &lt;a href=\"Chapters%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Chapter&lt;/a&gt; in \"The Elder Scrolls Online\", suitable for characters of all levels. You can travel to Summerset by a few different means:\nPsijic Order Skill Line.\nBecome a member of the ancient &lt;a href=\"Psijic%20Order%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Psijic Order&lt;/a&gt; Guild and gain access to never before seen Psijic techniques. As you advance your rank, you delve deeper into the foundations of &lt;a href=\"magic\"&gt;magic&lt;/a&gt;. The &lt;a href=\"Psijic%20Order%20Skill%20Line\"&gt;Psijic Order Skill Line&lt;/a&gt; consists of five active &lt;a href=\"Abilities%20%28Online%29\"&gt;abilities&lt;/a&gt;, five passive abilities, and an &lt;a href=\"Ultimate\"&gt;Ultimate&lt;/a&gt;. The active abilities include the following:\nCloudrest Trial.\nThe city of &lt;a href=\"Cloudrest%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Cloudrest&lt;/a&gt; is home to the Aerie of &lt;a href=\"Eton%20Nir\"&gt;Eton Nir&lt;/a&gt;, where an elite force of battlemages (the &lt;a href=\"Welkynar\"&gt;Welkynar&lt;/a&gt; of Eton Nir) are garrisoned alongside their faithful companion &lt;a href=\"gryphon\"&gt;gryphon&lt;/a&gt;s. The Aerie has guarded Summerset since the &lt;a href=\"First%20Age\"&gt;First Age&lt;/a&gt;, but the city of Cloudrest below now lies vacant. The last Welkynar of Eton Nir, &lt;a href=\"Olorime\"&gt;Olorime&lt;/a&gt;, has returned only to find the city fallen to some fell power. She was reporting to the Queen on the successful capture of an infamous &lt;a href=\"Sea%20Sload\"&gt;Sea Sload&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Shadow%20Magic\"&gt;shadowcaster&lt;/a&gt; named &lt;a href=\"Z%27Maja\"&gt;Z'Maja&lt;/a&gt;. It was so cowed by the Welkynar's valor that Z'Maja surrendered without a fight when they confronted her.\nAs you observe the city, you see black gryphons carrying black riders and giant shadowy tendrils from within the city itself. Eton Nir's roost is home to more than just gryphons now, and you will have to defeat challenges both in the mundus and in a twisted shadow copy if you wish to stop the darkness that grows in Summerset's very heart.\nJewelry Crafting.\n&lt;a href=\"Jewelry%20Crafting\"&gt;Jewelry Crafting&lt;/a&gt; is a new &lt;a href=\"Crafting%20%28Online%29\"&gt;crafting&lt;/a&gt; Skill Line allowing you to craft, upgrade, &lt;a href=\"research\"&gt;research&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Transmute%20system\"&gt;transmute&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Rings%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Rings&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Necklaces%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Necklaces&lt;/a&gt;. Note that this skill line and use of the &lt;a href=\"Jewelry%20Station\"&gt;Jewelry Crafting station&lt;/a&gt; are only available to players who own the new \"Summerset\" chapter, but anyone can use crafted jewelry made by others. To gain the new Skill Line, simply touch one of the new Jewelry Crafting stations found all over the world: in towns, cities, and the &lt;a href=\"Set%20Crafting%20Stations\"&gt;Set Crafting locations&lt;/a&gt;.\nJewelry Crafting Traits.\nWith the introduction of Jewelry Crafting, there are now nine &lt;a href=\"Traits\"&gt;Traits&lt;/a&gt; that can be applied to Rings and Necklaces. The six new Traits will not drop on existing item sets or from most sources in the game; rather, jewelry exhibiting each Trait can be acquired by participating in specific activities in the game. (The original three Traits - Arcane, Healthy, and Robust - will continue to appear on the jewelry found throughout the world).\nNew Item Sets.\nThere are 10 new &lt;a href=\"Item%20Sets\"&gt;Item Sets&lt;/a&gt; available from a variety of sources. 3 Item Sets are available at crafting stations in Summerset, 3 Item Sets are available as drops throughout Summerset, and 4 Item Sets are available as drops in the new Trial, Cloudrest.\nNew Collectibles.\nThis update brings a number of new Collectibles to ESO for you to obtain from various sources:\nPsijic Portals.\n&lt;a href=\"Psijic%20Portal\"&gt;Psijic Portal&lt;/a&gt;s are invisible to the untrained eye - only those with the \"&lt;a href=\"See%20the%20Unseen\"&gt;See the Unseen&lt;/a&gt;\" passive, granted as part of the &lt;a href=\"Psijic%20Skill%20Line\"&gt;Psijic Skill Line&lt;/a&gt;, can see these portals and interact with them.\nAbyssal Geysers.\n&lt;a href=\"Abyssal%20Geysers\"&gt;Abyssal Geysers&lt;/a&gt; are new events found only in Summerset, pitting you and your allies against wave upon wave of foes, capped off by a fight against a &lt;a href=\"Bosses%20%28Online%29\"&gt;boss&lt;/a&gt; monster. Depending on how well you and your allies perform, you may fight against a &lt;a href=\"Yaghra%20Monstrosity\"&gt;Yaghra Monstrosity&lt;/a&gt; or one of a number of deadlier, more rewarding named bosses.\nNew Houses.\nThere are two new &lt;a href=\"Housing%20%28Online%29\"&gt;homes&lt;/a&gt; in Summerset now available for you to purchase:\nPyandonean Motif.\n&lt;a href=\"Fishing%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Fisherfolk&lt;/a&gt; across Summerset have started reporting unusual bottles showing up in their catch. These bottles are of Pyandonean origin, and appear to contain crafting materials intended for &lt;a href=\"Maormer\"&gt;Maormer&lt;/a&gt; agents in Summerset.

These can be purchased for 20,000 &lt;a href=\"AP\"&gt;AP&lt;/a&gt; or earned from &lt;a href=\"Rewards%20of%20the%20Worthy\"&gt;Rewards of the Worthy&lt;/a&gt;. There are several restrictions in place to use these items:\nBattlegrounds Outfit Styles.\nWe've added new &lt;a href=\"Outfit%20Styles\"&gt;Outfit Styles&lt;/a&gt; to &lt;a href=\"Battlegrounds\"&gt;Battlegrounds&lt;/a&gt;! Now, when you complete a Battleground, you have a chance to obtain an Outfit Style for the &lt;a href=\"Pit%20Demons\"&gt;Pit Demons&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Storm%20Lords\"&gt;Storm Lords&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Fire%20Drakes\"&gt;Fire Drakes&lt;/a&gt;' unique armor appearances.\nNew PvP Collectible.\nThe new &lt;a href=\"Arena%20Gladiator\"&gt;Arena Gladiator&lt;/a&gt; Costume is now available, to those who would conquer their foes mercilessly. Simply collect 50 Arena Gladiator Proofs (found by completing the Conquest dailies in Cyrodiil) and purchase an Arena Gladiator's Exultation from a &lt;a href=\"War%20Researcher\"&gt;War Researcher&lt;/a&gt; for 10,000 AP. Use the Exultation, and it will consume the 50 Proofs and create a Runebox of the Arena Gladiator Costume.\nRespec System Updates.\nWe've updated the player ability &lt;a href=\"respec\"&gt;respec&lt;/a&gt; system so activating respec mode no longer clears all of your points, but instead allows you to add and remove points from your abilities. You'll still have the option to remove all points if you want a fresh start, though. We've also retained the morph-only option; for a reduced price, you can add and subtract any ability morphs.\nWelkynar Style Item.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Welkynar%20Style\"&gt;Welkynar Style&lt;/a&gt; Item, &lt;a href=\"Gryphon%20Plume\"&gt;Gryphon Plume&lt;/a&gt;s, is now available from &lt;a href=\"Cloudrest\"&gt;Cloudrest&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Trial\"&gt;Trial&lt;/a&gt;. This Style Item is proudly worn by the &lt;a href=\"gryphon\"&gt;gryphon&lt;/a&gt;-riding &lt;a href=\"Welkynar\"&gt;Welkynar&lt;/a&gt; themselves, and now you can earn the right to wear and craft this armor too - if you can defeat &lt;a href=\"Z%27Maja\"&gt;Z'Maja&lt;/a&gt;.\nChampion Point Increase.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Champion%20Point\"&gt;Champion Point&lt;/a&gt; cap has been raised by a total of 30 points (10 in each red/blue/green constellation) for a total of 780 Champion Points. The Champion Point &lt;a href=\"experience\"&gt;experience&lt;/a&gt; curve has been automatically adjusted with this new cap, so that earlier Champion Points require less experience and can be earned faster.\nClockwork City.\nCombat &amp; Gameplay.\n\"Monsters\"\nUI.\n\"General\"\nDark Brotherhood.\nArt &amp; Animation.\n\"General\"\nCombat &amp; Gameplay.\n\"Monsters\"\nDragon Bones.\nExploration &amp; Itemization.\n\"General\"\nImperial City.\nCombat &amp; Gameplay.\n\"General\"\nDungeons &amp; Group Content.\n\"Dungeons\"\nExploration &amp; Itemization.\n\"General\"\nOrsinium.\nArt &amp; Animation.\n\"General\"\nSummerset.\nArt &amp; Animation.\n\"General\"\nCombat &amp; Gameplay.\n\"Monsters &amp; Monster Abilities\"\n&lt;a href=\"World%20Bosses\"&gt;World Bosses&lt;/a&gt;\nCrafting &amp; Economy.\n\"&lt;a href=\"Alchemy%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Alchemy&lt;/a&gt;\"\n\"&lt;a href=\"Jewelry%20Crafting\"&gt;Jewelry Crafting&lt;/a&gt;\"\nDungeons &amp; Group Content.\n\"General\"\nExploration &amp; Itemization.\n\"General\"\n\"&lt;a href=\"Achievements%20%28Summerset%29\"&gt;Achievements&lt;/a&gt;\"\n\"Books\"\n\"&lt;a href=\"Fishing%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Fishing&lt;/a&gt;\"\nHousing.\n\"Furnishings\"\nQuests &amp; Zones.\n\"General\"\n\"&lt;a href=\"Public%20Dungeons\"&gt;Public Dungeons&lt;/a&gt; &amp; &lt;a href=\"Delves\"&gt;Delves&lt;/a&gt;\"\n\"&lt;a href=\"Quests%20%28Summerset%29\"&gt;Quests&lt;/a&gt;\"\nUI.\n\"Maps\"\nCombat and Gameplay.\n\"Ability Changes Overview\"\nWe've made numerous ability changes with this latest update \u2013 some with global implications, while others are specific tweaks and quality of life changes.

We've also introduced some improvements to the &lt;a href=\"Housing%20Editor\"&gt;Housing Editor&lt;/a&gt; with Undo/Redo options and furniture grouping. And we know everyone's excited to see you can now re-order your characters on the Character Select menu!\nThis latest update is approximately 3.2GB. Enjoy, and stay moist.\nNew Features / Updates / Big Changes.\nMurkmire DLC Game Pack.\nOn the southernmost tip of &lt;a href=\"Tamriel\"&gt;Tamriel&lt;/a&gt;, far beyond the boundaries that separate the known from the uncharted, lies a lush coastal marsh\u2014a region as beautiful as it is bizarre. Only the bravest travelers make the journey to Murkmire, and those that survive are forever changed.\nThe mud-caked streets and alleyways of &lt;a href=\"Lilmoth%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Lilmoth&lt;/a&gt; overflow with fresh-faced adventurers, intent on earning both fame and fortune in Tamriel's most perilous wilds. Many who enter the deep murk never return. But those that do recount stories of both beauty and horror--tales of savage beasts, vibrant flora, ancient ruins, and proud &lt;a href=\"Argonians%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Argonian&lt;/a&gt; tribes. Mysteries lurk in every dank corner of Murkmire. Do you have the strength and cunning to uncover them all?\nWhen Imperial &lt;a href=\"Potentate\"&gt;Potentate&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Versidue-Shaie\"&gt;Versidue-Shaie&lt;/a&gt; wanted a distant dungeon to house the most feared criminal and political prisoners of the &lt;a href=\"Second%20Empire\"&gt;Second Empire&lt;/a&gt;, he ordered a penal institution built on the coast of Black Marsh; it was named Blackrose Prison after the ancient city a day's march to the north. Now, you can enter the dreaded Blackrose Prison, and face waves of brutal enemies in an ever-escalating battle for treasure and glory.\nThere are 12 new Item Sets available from a variety of sources from Murkmire. This includes 3 Item Sets available as drops throughout Murkmire, 3 Item Sets available at &lt;a href=\"crafting%20stations\"&gt;crafting stations&lt;/a&gt; in Murkmire, and 6 Item Sets available from Blackrose Prison.\nWe've added a host of new &lt;a href=\"collectibles\"&gt;collectibles&lt;/a&gt; and rewards by completing various types of Murkmire content:\nMurkmire is a zone truly hungry for adventurers (and they don't even have to be human)! What are these strange &lt;a href=\"Scuttlebloom\"&gt;Scuttlebloom&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Trap%20Plants\"&gt;Trap Plants&lt;/a&gt;?\nThere are approximately 75 new &lt;a href=\"furnishing%20plans\"&gt;furnishing plans&lt;/a&gt; to discover and craft from Murkmire.\nMurkmire introduces over 50 new &lt;a href=\"Achievements%20%28Murkmire%29\"&gt;achievement&lt;/a&gt; for you to pursue.\nBase Game.\nBridges and &lt;a href=\"Milegates\"&gt;Milegates&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Cyrodiil%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Cyrodiil&lt;/a&gt; can now be destroyed and repaired!\nIn this update, we've refreshed the Item Sets available from &lt;a href=\"Rewards%20for%20the%20Worthy\"&gt;Rewards for the Worthy&lt;/a&gt;. They now provide an item from one of six all-new item sets, available solely through Rewards for the Worthy mails. Note the item sets that were previously available here are still available elsewhere in Cyrodiil. These items drop in the style of your Alliance, and are scaled to your level.\nThe new Gladiator &lt;a href=\"Emotes%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Emote&lt;/a&gt; displays an aggressive Gladiator gesture that varies depending what kind of weapon you have equipped, and is acquired by combining 30 Arena Gladiator's Proofs. These are available by completing &lt;a href=\"Conquest%20Missions\"&gt;Conquest Missions&lt;/a&gt; in Cyrodiil, with an Arena Gladiator's Mockery, available for purchase from &lt;a href=\"War%20Researchers\"&gt;War Researchers&lt;/a&gt; in Cyrodiil.\nYou can now rearrange the order your characters are listed on the Character Select screen! To do so, simply drag and drop a character field or use the clickable up and down buttons.\nWe've updated the &lt;a href=\"Housing%20Editor\"&gt;Housing Editor&lt;/a&gt; to include an edit history display, the ability to Undo and Redo edits, and the ability to link furniture together so that they can be moved and adjusted simultaneously.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Champion%20Point\"&gt;Champion Point&lt;/a&gt; cap has been raised by a total of 30 points (10 in each red/blue/green constellation) for a total of 810 Champion Points. The Champion Point &lt;a href=\"experience\"&gt;experience&lt;/a&gt; curve has been automatically adjusted with this new cap, so that earlier Champion Points require less experience and can be earned faster.\nWe have switched the Mac renderer from OpenGL to MoltenVK (Metal) to support the upcoming release of the upcoming MacOS Mojave.

Wrathstone introduces two new 4-player dungeons \u2013 &lt;a href=\"Frostvault\"&gt;Frostvault&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Depths%20of%20Malatar\"&gt;Depths of Malatar&lt;/a&gt; \u2013 in addition to a number of new item sets and collectibles. The base game features a new Zone Guide system that will assist you in finding content to complete in each zone. Additionally, we've added a new Battleground map and updated several older PvP item sets, as well as updated the Guild Trader Interface to add some new features.\nOur main focus for combat and gameplay this update was to update the racial passives to achieve a greater balance. Please note we've refunded all racial passives, so make sure to re-spend them after you log in.\nThe size of this update is approximately 3.41GB. We also want to call out that we're implementing some code related to ESO's database that will allow us greater flexibility with updates and maintenance as it continues to grow over time. Due to this change, after downloading this patch, you are likely to encounter a very long load screen upon first logging into the game. This will only occur the first time you log in after character select, and it will not affect subsequent logins. That said, the length of the load screen could vary anywhere between 5-10 minutes to a couple hours. Once you're at the load screen, please just wait until you've made it into the game; closing the client will not speed things up. Thanks!\nNew Features / Updates / Big Changes.\nWrathstone DLC Game Pack.\nWe've added a host of new collectibles and rewards by completing various types of Wrathstone content:\nIn addition to collectibles, we're adding a number of new furnishings themed around Wrathstone content:\nBase Game.\nThe sheer number of things to do in each zone in ESO can be daunting. To help you find and complete more content in each zone, we have implemented a new Zone Guide feature. \n&lt;a href=\"Eld%20Angvar\"&gt;Eld Angvar&lt;/a&gt; is now available to play in all playlists! In &lt;a href=\"Ayleidoon\"&gt;Ayleidoon&lt;/a&gt;, the lost language of the Wild Elves, Eld Angavar means \"old ironwood.\" Perhaps the Ayleids hoped such a name would grant permanence to this strange site between worlds. If so, it seems to have worked.\nIn this update, we've added a new pet and Weapon Outfit Styles for each of the Battleground teams:\n^The Weapon Outfit Styles for the Pit Demon, Storm Lord, and Fire Drake Battleground teams can be obtained the same way you can obtain an armor Outfit Style for these teams - by completing Battlegrounds.\nWe've been wanting to improve and update older item sets to keep them in-line with newer sets, a sentiment that you've also expressed. We want to limit the disruption of current player builds, so we redesigned six Cyrodiil sets that we found are being used by a smaller number of players. The intent is to rework these sets while retaining their original flavor.\nThe Guild Trader Interface has received a number of changes and new features in this update:\nMaterial Shipments received from Writ Rewards have been revamped!\nOver 40 new lines of achievements to pursue, including those for dungeons, holidays, prologues and more. These achievements can reward titles, collectibles, or a dye.\nThe Champion Point cap will not be increased for Update 21, or subsequent updates, until further notice.

In this wild and untamed land of the &lt;a href=\"Khajiit%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Khajiit&lt;/a&gt;, explore fertile grasslands, winding canyons, and wild borderlands where the Khajiit grow their famous &lt;a href=\"moon-sugar\"&gt;moon-sugar&lt;/a&gt; crops. &lt;a href=\"Elsweyr%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Elsweyr's&lt;/a&gt; capital is the beautiful city of &lt;a href=\"Rimmen%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Rimmen&lt;/a&gt;, currently occupied by &lt;a href=\"Imperials%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Imperial&lt;/a&gt; mercenaries, where the local Khajiit are equal part residents and captives. Beyond the city, meet wandering nomads, navigate the scorching deserts of &lt;a href=\"the%20Scar\"&gt;the Scar&lt;/a&gt;, and explore timeless Khajiiti ruins that are not as abandoned as they might seem. During your explorations, you'll need to beware of the fearsome &lt;a href=\"Dragons%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Dragons&lt;/a&gt; that soar the skies of Elsweyr!\nIn addition to this enticing zone, we've added the all-new &lt;a href=\"Necromancer%20%28Online%20Class%29\"&gt;Necromancer&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Classes%20%28Online%29\"&gt;class&lt;/a&gt; for those that are looking to make the undead serve your will. This new class brings three unique and formidable &lt;a href=\"Skill%20Line\"&gt;Skill Line&lt;/a&gt;s for you to master. Overwhelm your foes with destructive elemental spells, encase yourself in protective bone and flesh, or bolster you and your allies with living death magic!\nFor a challenging group experience, you can gather your strongest allies to take on our newest 12-player ppTrial[[, [[Sunspire]], that pits you against a group of menacing [[Dragons (Online)|Dragons]] within an ancient temple of [[Alkosh]]. Similar to previous Trials, Sunspire includes a normal and Veteran version. However, this is the first time you'll find each Dragon boss has its own [[Hard Mode]]. Additionally, if you're able to complete all [[Achievements (Elsweyr)|achievements]] associated with this Trial, you'll be handsomely rewarded with the exclusive\n[[Sunspire Champion Senche-Lion]] Mount!\nElsweyr also brings 14 new [[item sets]] (including Perfected versions only found in Veteran Sunspire Trial), a number of new [[Collectibles]], [[Dyes]], and [[Titles (Online)|Titles]], a new [[crafting ingredient]], and even a unique expandable [[Housing (Online)|house]] that you'll unlock simply by completing a portion of the [[Main Quest (Elsweyr)|main story]]!\nUpdate 22, which is a free update as part of the base game, includes several exciting additions and features as well. We've introduced the [[Guild Finder]] system, which is a new tool to connect players to likeminded [[Guilds (Online)|guilds]]. [[PvP]] players will surely have fun with the addition of [[Weapon Artifacts]], which after picked up, will swap out your ability bar so you'll be the living embodiment of this ancient weapon. There are also several [[Campaigns (Online)|campaign]] adjustments including [[Alliance]]-locked Campaigns, a new [[Imperial City (Online)|Imperial City]] Campaign, the removal of Guest Campaigns, and some changes to the [[Emperor (Online)|Emperor]] Leaderboard. We've also reworked 6 existing item sets in the theme of [[Necromancy]], and implemented a new tool for tracking logged [[Combat (Online)|combat]] events within your group.\nWe look forward to having you play our latest Chapter, which is approximately 7.94GB in size. Thank you, and enjoy your time in Elsweyr!\nNew Features / Updates / Big Changes.\nElsweyr Chapter.\nPrepare to embark on a new journey! In this patch, you can travel to the Khajiiti kingdom of [[Anequina]] in [[Northern Elsweyr]] to battle a rage of Dragons.\nNecromancers are able to summon relentless [[Undead (Online)|undead]] to attack their enemies, use blood and bone to protect themselves, and even manipulate the balance of life and death to help their allies. This new class uses the power of death to deal with any situation. Necromancers feature a unique set of abilities that use [[Corpses (Mechanic)|corpses]] as an alternate resource, with an emphasis on positional-based [[Gameplay (Online)|gameplay]] and a deep mastery curve.\nPracticing necromancy in [[Tamriel]] is a [[Crime (Online)|criminal]] act. In most cases, mages caught casting necromantic spells can feign ignorance or insist that the spell originates from a different [[school of magic]]. Some spells, however, are too horrific to overlook. Any necromantic ability marked as a \"CRIMINAL ACT\" is a major crime, and will offend the locals and alert the [[Guards (Online)|guards]].\nThe [[Temple of the First Cat]] was at one time a gleaming golden sight perched on the lip of a slumbering volcanic crater that drew in pilgrims from all over Elsweyr. Legend says its inner shrine was erected at the spot where [[Dro'Zira]] stood at the mountaintop and heard the great roar of [[Alkosh]], the Cat King of Time call to him. It is said the [[Lattice]] is thin at the mountain summit, and those most faithful can still hear echo of the First Cat's calling. To this day, the mountaintop temple remains the highest point in Elsweyr.\nOver time, the popularity of Alkosh in the Khajiiti pantheon waned, and less and less visitors made the harrowing trek up the mountain paths. The present-day temple is on the decline, though its monks still dutifully maintain the crumbling statues and relics. They are firm in their belief that one day, the mountain will awaken and Alkosh will return to call the Khajiiit to him once more.\nAs the [[Halls of Colossus]] unleash dragons over Elsweyr, the isolated monks at the temple are entirely unaware of the new threat. When a huge [[Nahviintaas|golden dragon]] crashes through the roof of the temple claiming to be a divine protector, they see the creature's presence as nothing short of a miracle and fall quickly for the dragon's lies and deceit. The once-holy temple has been warped into a horrible prison as the dragon deceives his followers into building an army of mortals and dragons under his command.\nThere are 14 new [[Item Sets]] available from a variety of sources from Elsweyr. This includes 3 Item Sets available as drops throughout Elsweyr, 3 Item Sets available at [[Set stations|crafting stations]] in Elsweyr, and 8 Item Sets available from Sunspire Trial.\nWe've added a host of new [[collectibles]] and rewards by completing various types of Elsweyr content:\nWe've added several new [[dyes]] and [[Titles (Online)|titles]] by completing various content within Elsweyr and Sunspire Trial, listed below:\n[[Anequina Motif]] chapters, as well as the associated style item [[Shimmering Sand]] can now be obtained from completing delve and world boss dailies in Elsweyr.\n[[Dragon's Blood]] and can be obtained by defeating Dragons. Both of these new [[Alchemy (Online)|Alchemy]] [[reagents]] carry the new effect trait of [[Minor Heroism]]!\nBase Game Update.\n[[Guilds (Online)|Guild]] leaders now have the ability to list their guild within the Guild Finder, a new tool for connecting players to likeminded guilds.\nIn addition to the Guild Finder, we've added a few additional guild related features as well:\n[[Volendrung (Online)|Volendrung]] has been unleashed on [[Cyrodiil (Online)|Cyrodiil]] in all [[Campaigns (Online)|campaigns]]! After picking up the weapon, your [[ability bar]] will swap out, stats will be adjusted and you'll be the living embodiment of this ancient weapon! \nAll currently-existing campaigns have been shut down, and you have received one free campaign home selection. We hope you enjoyed your time in [[Vivec (Online)|Vivec]], [[Shor]], [[Sotha Sil (Online)|Sotha Sil]] and [[Kyne]]!\nIn this update, you'll find that we've reworked several existing item sets in the theme of [[Necromancy]]!\nAdded the ability for you to perform a deep dive into logged [[Combat (Online)|combat]] events within your group to see things like [[Damage (Online)|damage]], [[Healing (Online)|healing]], [[Attributes (Online)|resource]] usage, and much more. This is done by exporting group-based encounter logs to a local file, which gets uploaded to the ESO Logs website. For more information about this feature, please see &lt;a href=\"https%3A//forums.elderscrollsonline.com/en/discussion/467949/encounter-logging\"&gt;this forum post&lt;/a&gt;.\nFully completing a [[Skyshards (Online)|Skyshard]] Hunter [[Achievements (Online)|achievement]] on one character will now unlock the ability to purchase that achievement on other characters. The purchased achievement will award all associated [[skillpoints]], or any remaining skillpoints, that your current character has not yet acquired.\nFixes and Improvements.\nDLCs and Chapters.\nClockwork City.\n\"General\"\n\"[[Trials]]\"\nDragon Bones.\n\"[[Group Dungeons|Dungeons]]\"\nHorns of the Reach.\n\"General\"\nImperial City.\n\"General\"\nMorrowind.\n\"Trials\"\n\"[[Quests (ESO Morrowind)|Quests]]\"\nMurkmire.\n\"General\"\n\"[[Achievements (Murkmire)|Achievements]]\"\n\"General\"\n\"Quests\"\nOrsinium.\n\"[[Eidetic Memory]]\"\nSummerset.\n\"[[Cloudrest (Online)|Cloudrest]] Trial\"\n\"General\"\n\"General\"\n\"[[Quests (Summerset)|Quests]]\"\nThieves Guild.\n\"[[Maw of Lorkhaj]] Trial\"\n\"Eidetic Memory\"\nWrathstone.\n\"Dungeons\"\nCombat and Gameplay.\n\"General\"\nDeveloper Comment: \"As mentioned in this post, the main focus of this patch is bringing [[Abilities (Online)|abilities]] in line with our standards for specific categories in terms of their cost, [[Damage (Online)|damage]], ranges, etc. We actively wanted to avoid homogenization of how abilities interact with mechanics, but more so wanted to ensure we had a healthy standard to follow and build abilities (like Necromancer!) with in the future so players could identify patterns, and better employ them in their own playstyles. The focus in this update is mainly on [[Classes (Online)|Class]] abilities, but touched outwards to a few specific categories such as \"point blank\" [[Area of Effect]]s and [[Damage Over Time]] abilities. That being said, there's still plenty of other changes outside this including a lot of [[Bugs (Online)|bug]] fixes with abilities and how they rank up.

Final boss kills in Lair of Maarselok or Moongrave Fane also have a chance to drop one of six new furnishing recipes, teaching you how to craft several shrines and floors from the ancient ruins scattered around Elsweyr. These can drop at any difficulty, but are more likely to appear in Veteran Hard Mode clears of Grundwulf or Maarselok .\nBASE GAME UPDATE\nMulti-Crafting\nYou can now perform several actions in bulk at &lt;a href=\"crafting%20stations\"&gt;crafting stations&lt;/a&gt; and receive your items immediately! This includes refining, creation, &lt;a href=\"deconstruct\"&gt;deconstruct&lt;/a&gt;ing, and extracting, and applies to all crafting stations.

If your guild has multiple winning bids, the bid with the highest gold amount is the one awarded. If you have multiple winning bids with the same gold amount, the oldest bid placed is awarded.\nUndaunted Key Improvements\nAs of this update, &lt;a href=\"Undaunted%20Keys\"&gt;Undaunted Keys&lt;/a&gt; are now located in the currency tab and no longer take up valuable inventory space. You can also now spend your keys directly at each of the three &lt;a href=\"pledge%20masters\"&gt;pledge masters&lt;/a&gt; (&lt;a href=\"Urgarlag%20Chief-bane\"&gt;Urgarlag Chief-bane&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Glirion%20the%20Redbeard\"&gt;Glirion the Redbeard&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Maj%20al-Ragath\"&gt;Maj al-Ragath&lt;/a&gt;) in a number of ways.\nFragments\nTo help alleviate items taking up inventory, some items have been converted into a new type of collection: &lt;a href=\"Fragments\"&gt;Fragments&lt;/a&gt;.\nJewelry Crafting Master Writ Improvements\nIn this update, new &lt;a href=\"Jewelry%20Crafting\"&gt;Jewelry Crafting&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Master%20Writs\"&gt;Master Writs&lt;/a&gt; received from &lt;a href=\"Jewelry%20crafting%20writ\"&gt;daily Jewelry writs&lt;/a&gt; will most commonly request a superior piece of &lt;a href=\"Jewelry%20%28Online%29\"&gt;jewelry&lt;/a&gt;, with a rare chance of epic, and a very rare chance of legendary. The number of writs awarded from newly received epic and legendary Jewelry Crafting Master Writs has been significantly increased. This change is not retroactive.\nMaster Writ Merchant Updates\nThe Master Mediator &lt;a href=\"Rolis%20Hlaalu\"&gt;Rolis Hlaalu&lt;/a&gt; is now selling a new legendary furnishing recipe for each tradeskill, while Achievement Mediator &lt;a href=\"Faustina%20Curio\"&gt;Faustina Curio&lt;/a&gt; offers the prior legendary recipes as well as new envelopes that contain random furnishing plans from &lt;a href=\"Summerset%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Summerset&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Clockwork%20City%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Clockwork City&lt;/a&gt;.\nNew Collectibles\nThis update features the new &lt;a href=\"Battleground%20Runner%20Armor\"&gt;Battleground Runner Armor&lt;/a&gt; Outfit Style which you can acquire through certain &lt;a href=\"Battlegrounds\"&gt;Battlegrounds&lt;/a&gt;:\nUpdated Item Sets\nMany &lt;a href=\"item%20sets\"&gt;item sets&lt;/a&gt; have had bug fixes or value adjustments based on our ability audits. For example, some &lt;a href=\"Arena%20Sets\"&gt;weapon altering sets&lt;/a&gt; have seen their bonuses adjusted if their related ability has seen drastic adjustment. This is by no means a full pass, and we will be continuing our audit with item sets in a future update.\nNew Furnishings\nNew Titles\nIn this update, there are several new Titles to earn:\nNew Achievements\nPursue more than 40 new achievements by testing your mettle in the Lair of Maarselok and Moongrave Fane, as well as participating in holiday &lt;a href=\"Events%20%28Online%29\"&gt;events&lt;/a&gt; and reaching the maximum rank in various existing skills. (If you've already reached the maximum rank in a skill receiving an achievement, you will be given credit retroactively).\nSkill Lines for Alternate Characters\nFully completing a skill line on one character now unlocks the ability to &lt;a href=\"Crown%20Store\"&gt;purchase&lt;/a&gt; that achievement and skill line on other characters. Once unlocked on your current character, the chosen skill line immediately advances to its maximum rank. All abilities contained within the purchased skill line arrive unranked, allowing you to advance and morph the skill as you see fit.\nDARK BROTHERHOOD DLC GAME PACK FIXES &amp; IMPROVEMENTS.\nEXPLORATION &amp; ITEMIZATION.\n\"General\"\nQUESTS &amp; ZONES.\n\"General\"\n\"Quests\"\nTHE ELDER SCROLLS ONLINE ELSWEYR FIXES &amp; IMPROVEMENTS.\nART &amp; ANIMATION.\n\"Visual Effects\"\nCOMBAT &amp; GAMEPLAY.\nDeveloper Comment:\nMany of the adjustments you'll find below are a result of our ongoing ability audit, to adhere to standards or for overall balance/quality of life as well as some fixes for issues that required further investigation from &lt;a href=\"Update%2022\"&gt;Update 22&lt;/a&gt;.\n\"&lt;a href=\"Necromancer%20%28Online%20Class%29\"&gt;Necromancer&lt;/a&gt;\"\nEXPLORATION &amp; ITEMIZATION.\n\"General\"\n\"Achievements\"\nQUESTS &amp; ZONES.\n\"General\"\n\"Quests\"\n\"&lt;a href=\"Tutorial\"&gt;Tutorial&lt;/a&gt;\"\nUI.\n\"General\"\nHORNS OF THE REACH DLC GAME PACK FIXES &amp; IMPROVEMENTS.\nDUNGEONS &amp; GROUP CONTENT.\n\"Dungeons\"\nIMPERIAL CITY DLC GAME PACK FIXES &amp; IMPROVEMENTS.\nDUNGEONS &amp; GROUP CONTENT.\n\"Dungeons\"\nTHE ELDER SCROLLS ONLINE MORROWIND FIXES &amp; IMPROVEMENTS.\nART &amp; ANIMATION.\n\"Animation\"\nCOMBAT &amp; GAMEPLAY.\n\"Monster Abilities\"\nDUNGEONS &amp; GROUP CONTENT.\n\"Trials\"\nQUESTS &amp; ZONES.\n\"General\"\nMURKMIRE DLC GAME PACK FIXES &amp; IMPROVEMENTS.\nEXPLORATION &amp; ITEMIZATION.\n\"General\"\nQUESTS &amp; ZONES.\n\"General\"\n\"Quests\"\nORSINIUM DLC GAME PACK FIXES &amp; IMPROVEMENTS.\nQUESTS &amp; ZONES.\n\"General\"\n\"Quests\"\nSUMMERSET FIXES &amp; IMPROVEMENTS.\nEXPLORATION &amp; ITEMIZATION.\n\"General\"\nQUESTS &amp; ZONES.\n\"Quests\"\nUI.\n\"General\"\nCOMBAT &amp; GAMEPLAY.\nCOMBAT &amp; ABILITIES.\n\"Developer Comment:\"\nIn the theme of our ongoing ability audit, many of this Update's ability adjustments have been set on the goal of bringing values (such as Healing or Damage per Second, and cost) to be more consistent with one another. We believe that auxiliary effects and &lt;a href=\"passives\"&gt;passives&lt;/a&gt; that are paired with these abilities are the primary means of adding depth and variety to each individual ability, while the core function should remain relatively close so you have an easier time discerning effectiveness of these abilities, and there are less overall situations of \"dead abilities\". Many changes you'll see also strive to add more consistency to the behavior of how these abilities interact with things like critical strike chance, or scaling mechanisms, in hopes to remove some of the many \"hidden\" expertise moments where some abilities just feel weaker for certain builds, because of arbitrary mechanisms, and required failure to learn. This being said, we also want to make it clear that our standards are not unflinching, and just because we've done a pass of abilities with the audit, it doesn't mean we'll never return to them or make adjustments. The goal of standardization we've had with &lt;a href=\"Update%2021\"&gt;Update 21&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Update%2022\"&gt;22&lt;/a&gt; is not done under the guise that our standards are perfect, but rather the focus on consistency and order. The concept of balance is highly contextual, so we've taken the stance of reigning in the varied behaviors of our incredibly dynamic game so we can do a better job moving forward addressing abilities that fall out of line.\n\"General\"\n\"Buffs and Debuffs\"\n\"&lt;a href=\"Dragonknight\"&gt;Dragonknight&lt;/a&gt;\"\n\"&lt;a href=\"Nightblade%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Nightblade&lt;/a&gt;\"\n\"&lt;a href=\"Sorcerer%20%28Online%20Class%29\"&gt;Sorcerer&lt;/a&gt;\"\n\"&lt;a href=\"Templar\"&gt;Templar&lt;/a&gt;\"\nNote that the sphere can no longer be CC broken early, but can still be cleansed.\n\"&lt;a href=\"Warden\"&gt;Warden&lt;/a&gt;\"\n\"&lt;a href=\"Weapon%20skills\"&gt;Weapon&lt;/a&gt;\"\n\"&lt;a href=\"Armor%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Armor&lt;/a&gt;\"\n\"&lt;a href=\"World%20skills\"&gt;World&lt;/a&gt;\"\n\"&lt;a href=\"Guild%20skill\"&gt;Guild&lt;/a&gt;\"\n\"&lt;a href=\"Alliance%20War\"&gt;Alliance War&lt;/a&gt;\"\nITEMIZATION &amp; ITEM SETS.\n\"General\"\n\"Consumables\"\n\"Item Sets\"\nThis item set will now retain its bonus if you bar swap before it can first register its damage.

Dragonhold introduces not only the new zone of &lt;a href=\"Southern%20Elsweyr\"&gt;Southern Elsweyr&lt;/a&gt;, but also adds two &lt;a href=\"world%20bosses\"&gt;world bosses&lt;/a&gt;, two &lt;a href=\"delves\"&gt;delves&lt;/a&gt;, and new &lt;a href=\"Dragon%20Hunt\"&gt;Dragon Hunt&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Dragonscours\"&gt;areas&lt;/a&gt; (complete with fearsome &lt;a href=\"Frost%20Dragon%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Frost&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Storm%20Dragon\"&gt;Storm Dragon&lt;/a&gt;s). We've also added several new &lt;a href=\"collectibles\"&gt;collectibles&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"item%20sets\"&gt;item sets&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Achievements%20%28Dragonhold%29\"&gt;achievements&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Titles%20%28Online%29\"&gt;titles&lt;/a&gt; for you to acquire.\nThe base game introduces our updated &lt;a href=\"Activity%20Finder\"&gt;Activity Finder&lt;/a&gt; for dungeons and &lt;a href=\"Battlegrounds\"&gt;Battlegrounds&lt;/a&gt;, and also focuses heavily on the first part of the performance improvements for ESO with an overhaul of how memory is managed. Along with updating 3-piece item sets, you'll find we've made several improvements to &lt;a href=\"Warden\"&gt;Warden&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"Sorcerer%20%28Online%20Class%29\"&gt;Sorcerers&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Dragonknight\"&gt;Dragonknight&lt;/a&gt;s in the realm of identity, adjusted some values of &lt;a href=\"Damage%20over%20Time\"&gt;Damage over Time&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Abilities%20%28Online%29\"&gt;abilities&lt;/a&gt;, and more.\nNote that due to the number of &lt;a href=\"Combat%20%28Online%29\"&gt;combat&lt;/a&gt; changes, we have reduced skill &lt;a href=\"respec\"&gt;respec&lt;/a&gt;s to zero gold for one week until October 28 at 10am EDT. We hope you enjoy this latest update, which is approximately 3.81GB.\nNew Features / Updates / Big Changes.\nDragonhold DLC game pack.\nSouthern Elsweyr, a once prestigious and wealthy land built up around the trade routes of the shimmering moonlit waters of the &lt;a href=\"Topal%20Sea\"&gt;Topal Sea&lt;/a&gt;, is now a mere shadow of its former self. The effects of the &lt;a href=\"Knahaten%20Flu\"&gt;Knahaten Flu&lt;/a&gt; still linger throughout the province\u2014an event that decimated most of the population and left it as a land of ruthless lawlessness filled with slavers and pirates. Now scorched lands, burnt buildings, and ruins of an era long passed cover the region of &lt;a href=\"Pellitine\"&gt;Pellitine&lt;/a&gt; leaving the citizens with little hope for the future. Yet the problems of old pale in comparison to its newest threats.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Dragons%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Dragons&lt;/a&gt; have returned and ravage the lands with fire and chaos. With them, a cult led by a &lt;a href=\"Khajiit%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Khajiiti&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Dragon%20Priests%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Dragon Priest&lt;/a&gt; has emerged and seeks to take advantage of the hopeless and lost. The walled remains of &lt;a href=\"Senchal%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Senchal&lt;/a&gt; offer the only sanction to those who seek sanctum, but even those protections threaten to give way to the might of the Dragons. To give the people a chance, an ancient order must be reformed. One that will defend the people and fight to take back the land from the Dragons and &lt;a href=\"Dragon%20Cult\"&gt;their cult&lt;/a&gt;. Do you have the courage and might to reform the &lt;a href=\"Dragonguard%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Dragonguard&lt;/a&gt;?\nIn addition to the DLC, the &lt;a href=\"Season%20of%20the%20Dragon\"&gt;Season of the Dragon&lt;/a&gt; comes to its epic conclusion in Dragonhold! The combined forces of your allies from Northern and Southern Elsweyr must join together and put a stop to &lt;a href=\"Kaalgrontiid%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Kaalgrontiid's&lt;/a&gt; ultimate plan hundreds of years in the making.\nOnce you have reformed the Dragonguard and found a base to call home, you can begin to rebuild the Dragonguard by completing the various quests found within the sanctum, including both main and daily quests. As you complete these quests, the Dragonguard will begin to grow with new allies and services appearing within the sanctum.\nFrost and Storm Dragons from the far reaches of &lt;a href=\"Tamriel\"&gt;Tamriel&lt;/a&gt; have come out of hiding. Drawn to &lt;a href=\"Elsweyr%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Elsweyr&lt;/a&gt; by their brethren, these fearsome creatures bring unique and devastating destruction magic to bear on those brave enough to face them.\nIn this update, there are 6 new item sets to obtain \u2013 3 item sets that drop from Southern Elsweyr, and 3 &lt;a href=\"crafted%20sets\"&gt;crafted sets&lt;/a&gt;.\nDragonhold introduces over 30 achievements with 6 new titles, a new &lt;a href=\"dye\"&gt;dye&lt;/a&gt; and several exciting collectible rewards.\n&lt;a href=\"Dragonguard%20Motif\"&gt;Dragonguard Motif&lt;/a&gt; chapters, as well as the associated style item , are obtained from completing &lt;a href=\"daily%20quests\"&gt;daily quests&lt;/a&gt; for the Dragonguard from &lt;a href=\"Chizbari%20the%20Chipper\"&gt;Chizbari the Chipper&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Dirge%20Truptor\"&gt;Dirge Truptor&lt;/a&gt;, Dragonguard Taskmasters.\nThose who complete the main story quest \"&lt;a href=\"The%20Dragonguard\"&gt;The Dragonguard&lt;/a&gt;\" in &lt;a href=\"Dragonhold\"&gt;Dragonhold&lt;/a&gt; will earn the final story tablet for the &lt;a href=\"Hall%20of%20the%20Lunar%20Champion\"&gt;Hall of the Lunar Champion&lt;/a&gt;, \"Behold Khunzar-ri's Ambition\". Placing this tablet on the Altar of Ambition opens a portal to &lt;a href=\"Lion%27s%20Cradle\"&gt;Lion's Cradle&lt;/a&gt;, Khunzar-ri's childhood home atop a bluff in Southern Elsweyr.\nBase Game.\nThis update introduces an updated &lt;a href=\"Activity%20Finder\"&gt;Activity Finder&lt;/a&gt;. Note the UI will still appear the same as before, but we have re-coded the tool to be more effective under load. Specific changes to the tool that will be most noticeable are outlined below:\nIn this update, we've implemented a new memory pooling system to reduce memory fragmentation. This fundamentally changes how we handle memory use in ESO, and will improve your experience by significantly reducing the chance of crashing from running out of memory. You may also notice a minor FPS improvement due to a reduction of load in peak memory use situations, such as when lots of other players or effects are in an area.\nThese new Outfit Styles will occasionally be found by completing &lt;a href=\"Flag%20Games\"&gt;Flag Games&lt;/a&gt; (and only Flag Games) in Battlegrounds.\nPart of our evaluation of older item sets revealed that our 3-Piece item sets were underperforming. These sets were originally created for the purpose of adding more diversity in player builds without sacrificing power. They will now better fulfill their purpose by giving you the opportunity to run different types of gear combinations outside the popular 5-Piece sets and a &lt;a href=\"Monster%20Mask\"&gt;Monster Mask&lt;/a&gt; meta, and help reinforce the idea of \"play the way you want\".\nIn this update, we've opened a new Cyrodiil &lt;a href=\"Campaigns%20%28Online%29\"&gt;campaign&lt;/a&gt;. Laatvulon is a 30 day, CP-enabled, non-Alliance locked Campaign. Additionally, we have shut down the Yolnahkriin campaign. Anyone assigned to this campaign at shutdown will receive a free campaign reassignment.\nWe've added several new account features that you can access in-game:\n=Fixes &amp; Improvements=\nDLCs &amp; Chapters.\nClockwork City Fixes &amp; Improvements.\nQuests &amp; Zones.\nGeneral\nElsweyr Fixes &amp; Improvements.\nArt &amp; Animation.\nGeneral\nDungeons &amp; Group Content.\n&lt;a href=\"Sunspire\"&gt;Sunspire&lt;/a&gt; Trial\nExploration &amp; Itemization.\nGeneral\n&lt;a href=\"Achievements%20%28Elsweyr%29\"&gt;Achievements&lt;/a&gt;\nHousing.\n&lt;a href=\"Furnishings%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Furnishings&lt;/a&gt;\n&lt;a href=\"Housing%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Homes&lt;/a&gt;\nQuests &amp; Zones.\n&lt;a href=\"Quests%20%28Elsweyr%29\"&gt;Quests&lt;/a&gt;\nUI.\nGeneral\nHorns of the Reach Fixes &amp; Improvements.\nDungeons &amp; Group Content.\n&lt;a href=\"Group%20Dungeons\"&gt;Dungeons&lt;/a&gt;\nImperial City Fixes &amp; Improvements.\nCombat &amp; Gameplay.\nMonster Abilities\nMorrowind Fixes &amp; Improvements.\nDungeons &amp; Group Content.\n&lt;a href=\"Halls%20of%20Fabrication\"&gt;Halls of Fabrication&lt;/a&gt; Trial\nQuests &amp; Zones.\n&lt;a href=\"Quests%20%28ESO%20Morrowind%29\"&gt;Quests&lt;/a&gt;\nMurkmire Fixes &amp; Improvements.\nDungeons &amp; Group Content.\n&lt;a href=\"Blackrose%20Prison%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Blackrose Prison&lt;/a&gt;\nExploration &amp; Itemization.\nGeneral\n&lt;a href=\"Achievements%20%28Murkmire%29\"&gt;Achievements&lt;/a&gt;\nHousing.\nGeneral\nFurnishings\nQuests &amp; Zones.\n&lt;a href=\"Quests%20%28Murkmire%29\"&gt;Quests&lt;/a&gt;\nOrsinium Fixes &amp; Improvements.\nQuests &amp; Zones.\n&lt;a href=\"Quests%20%28Orsinium%29\"&gt;Quests&lt;/a&gt;\nScalebreaker Fixes &amp; Improvements.\nDungeons &amp; Group Content.\nDungeons\nUI.\nGeneral\nSummerset Fixes &amp; Improvements.\nCombat &amp; Gameplay.\nMonster Abilities\nDungeons &amp; Group Content.\n&lt;a href=\"Cloudrest\"&gt;Cloudrest&lt;/a&gt; Trial\nExploration &amp; Itemization.\nGeneral\nQuests &amp; Zones.\n&lt;a href=\"Quests%20%28Summerset%29\"&gt;Quests&lt;/a&gt;\nThieves Guild Fixes &amp; Improvements.\nDungeons &amp; Group Content.\n&lt;a href=\"Maw%20of%20Lorkhaj\"&gt;Maw of Lorkhaj&lt;/a&gt; Trial\nExploration &amp; Itemization.\n&lt;a href=\"Achievements%20%28Thieves%20Guild%29\"&gt;Achievements&lt;/a&gt;\nWrathstone Fixes &amp; Improvements.\nDungeons &amp; Group Content.\nDungeons\nBase Game Fixes &amp; Improvements.\nAlliance War &amp; PvP.\n&lt;a href=\"Campaigns%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Campaigns&lt;/a&gt;\nArt &amp; Animation.\nGeneral\nFigure\nTerrain\nVisual Effects\nAudio.\nGeneral\nCombat &amp; Gameplay.\nGeneral\n&lt;a href=\"Creatures%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Monsters&lt;/a&gt;\nCrafting &amp; Economy.\nGeneral\nCrown Store &amp; Crown Crates.\nGeneral\nDungeons &amp; Group Content.\nGeneral\nDungeons\nTrials\nExploration &amp; Itemization.\nGeneral\n&lt;a href=\"Eidetic%20Memory\"&gt;Eidetic Memory&lt;/a&gt;\n&lt;a href=\"Mementos\"&gt;Mementos&lt;/a&gt;\nHousing.\nGeneral\n&lt;a href=\"Furnishings%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Furnishings&lt;/a&gt;\n&lt;a href=\"Housing%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Homes&lt;/a&gt;\nMiscellaneous.\nGeneral\nQuests &amp; Zones.\n&lt;a href=\"Bangkorai\"&gt;Bangkorai&lt;/a&gt;\n&lt;a href=\"Coldharbour\"&gt;Coldharbour&lt;/a&gt;\n&lt;a href=\"Grahtwood\"&gt;Grahtwood&lt;/a&gt;\n&lt;a href=\"Mournhold%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Mournhold&lt;/a&gt;\n&lt;a href=\"Reaper%27s%20March\"&gt;Reaper's March&lt;/a&gt;\n&lt;a href=\"Shadowfen\"&gt;Shadowfen&lt;/a&gt;\n&lt;a href=\"Stonefalls%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Stonefalls&lt;/a&gt;\n&lt;a href=\"Witches%20Festival\"&gt;Witches Festival&lt;/a&gt;\nUI.\nGeneral\nCollectibles\n&lt;a href=\"Crafting%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Crafting&lt;/a&gt;\nGamepad Mode\nGameplay\n&lt;a href=\"Guilds%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Guilds&lt;/a&gt; &amp; Guild Functionality\nHelp &amp; Tutorials\nKnown Issues.\nCombat &amp; Gameplay.\nGeneral\nMiscellaneous.\n&lt;a href=\"Activity%20Finder\"&gt;Activity Finder&lt;/a&gt;"}

Harrowstorm introduces two new 4-player dungeons \u2013 &lt;a href=\"Icereach\"&gt;Icereach&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Unhallowed%20Grave%20%28Location%29\"&gt;Unhallowed Grave&lt;/a&gt; \u2013 in addition to a number of new &lt;a href=\"item%20sets\"&gt;item sets&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Collectibles%20%28Online%29\"&gt;collectibles&lt;/a&gt;. Our biggest focus for this update was further improving game performance, with an emphasis on frame rate stability, ultimately resulting in fewer drops in your game's framerate. The &lt;a href=\"Combat%20%28Online%29\"&gt;combat&lt;/a&gt; changes you'll see support this goal, which you can read more about in &lt;a href=\"https%3A//forums.elderscrollsonline.com/en/discussion/507778\"&gt;this forum post&lt;/a&gt;.\nAdditionally, please take note for this update, we're refreshing our patching and file manifest data to remove duplicate files and older data that is no longer needed. This will result in major improvements to load times, streaming of assets, reliability of asset loads, and a reduction of space taken up by the client on your hard drive. In order to achieve this, you will be required to re-download the entirety of the game. To this end, the size of this update is 64.22 GB. To read more about this patching overhaul, please visit &lt;a href=\"https%3A//www.elderscrollsonline.com/en-us/news/post/57719\"&gt;this website article&lt;/a&gt;.

Doing this will change the ESO launcher language to Russian \u2013 this only changes the language for the launcher, not the game. This launcher update is in preparation for ESO supporting Russian language text later this year \u2013 we'll be announcing a formal launch date soon so stay tuned!\nNew Features / Updates / Big Changes.\nHarrowstorm DLC Game Pack.\nNew Item Sets.\nUpdate 25 brings the standard 8 new &lt;a href=\"dungeon%20sets\"&gt;dungeon sets&lt;/a&gt; made of 2 &lt;a href=\"Light%20Armor%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Light Armor&lt;/a&gt;, 2 &lt;a href=\"Medium%20Armor%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Medium Armor&lt;/a&gt;, 2 &lt;a href=\"Heavy%20Armor%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Heavy Armor&lt;/a&gt;, and 2 Unique Monster Masks split up based on each dungeon released!

In order to reach these areas, you must first ensure your &lt;a href=\"alliance\"&gt;alliance&lt;/a&gt; has control of the town, so prepare to spill blood! Do note, however, that these stations will still remain &lt;a href=\"Attunable%20Crafting%20Stations\"&gt;attuneable&lt;/a&gt; for the crafty crafters who do their writs!\nNew Collectibles &amp; Dyes.\nSeveral new Collectibles can be obtained by participating in the new Harrowstorm dungeons and completing various achievements:\nNew Achievements &amp; Titles.\nHarrowstorm introduces over 30 achievements for proving your prowess in the Icereach and Unhallowed Grave dungeons.

In this patch, you can travel to the &lt;a href=\"Nords%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Nord&lt;/a&gt; nation of &lt;a href=\"Western%20Skyrim\"&gt;Western Skyrim&lt;/a&gt; and uncover the &lt;a href=\"Dark%20Heart%20of%20Skyrim\"&gt;Dark Heart of Skyrim&lt;/a&gt;.\nAntiquities.\nThe new &lt;a href=\"Antiquities\"&gt;Antiquities&lt;/a&gt; system allows you to scour all of &lt;a href=\"Tamriel\"&gt;Tamriel&lt;/a&gt; for lost relics and treasures. Through the use of two new &lt;a href=\"Skills%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Skill&lt;/a&gt; Lines and the new &lt;a href=\"Antiquarian%27s%20Eye\"&gt;Antiquarian's Eye&lt;/a&gt; Tool, you'll be able to uncover new &lt;a href=\"furnishings\"&gt;furnishings&lt;/a&gt;, equipment, a mount, and more! \nTo begin, visit the &lt;a href=\"Antiquarian%20Circle\"&gt;Antiquarian Circle&lt;/a&gt;, located in the city of Solitude, in Western Skyrim. There, speak with &lt;a href=\"Verita%20Numida\"&gt;Verita Numida&lt;/a&gt;, who will introduce you to the Antiquarian's Eye, and teach you the skills needed to begin seeking Antiquities. You can then strike out on your own, or continue to learn more about the Antiquarian's Eye and how the Antiquities system works from Verita and &lt;a href=\"Gabrielle%20Benele\"&gt;Gabrielle Benele&lt;/a&gt;. \nNew Trial: Kyne's Aegis.\n&lt;a href=\"Kyne%27s%20Aegis\"&gt;Kyne's Aegis&lt;/a&gt; is a keep on an island north of Solitude. Its original intent was to be a bulwark against northern invasions which approached the coast via the easiest channel. &lt;a href=\"Thane%20Ogvar\"&gt;Thane Ogvar&lt;/a&gt; was given ownership over the fort and over time, it morphed into a northern fishing village in addition to a fort. The island's gold veins led to the Thane establishing a mining operation. Until recently, the fort has remained peaceful with only the occasional northern squall cropping up to cause concern. The transformation of the island to a fishing and mining spot has led to the slow decline of the fort.\nA short time ago, tremendously large longships appeared to the north. Before a proper defense could be mustered, these ships crashed into the island, disgorging &lt;a href=\"Sea%20Giants\"&gt;Sea Giants&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Half-Giants\"&gt;Half-Giants&lt;/a&gt;, led by a powerful Vampire lord. These creatures of myth quickly overwhelmed the northern section of the island and have begun the assault of the fort proper.\nWith the island threatened, the Thane has sent for assistance from anyone that can reach the island.\nNew Item Sets.\nThis update brings a number of new item sets you can obtain through various means, either from the overland, the new Trial, crafting, or the new Antiquities system.\nNew Collectibles.\nIn this update, we've added several new collectibles for you to, well, collect!\nNew Achievements, Dyes &amp; Titles.\nWith Greymoor, we're adding over 80 new achievements with 12 unique titles, various achievement furnishing unlocking, 2 dyes, and more! \nNew Homes.\nThere are two new homes to obtain in this update:\nNew Furnishings.\nA wide variety of new furnishings are available to find or craft with Greymoor.\nNew Motifs.\nThere are four new motifs being added with this update:\nBase Game.\nVampire Updates.\n&lt;a href=\"Vampire%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Vampires&lt;/a&gt; have received significant changes this update, with a focus on improving the entire experience as a Vampire. Revisions to parts of the Vampire quest, &lt;a href=\"Justice%20System\"&gt;Justice System&lt;/a&gt; ramifications, and even improved Feeding visuals are just a few examples of these changes. The &lt;a href=\"Vampire%20%28Online%20Skill%20Tree%29\"&gt;Vampire Skill Line&lt;/a&gt; has also been updated, adding 3 brand new Active Abilities while also revising the previous Active, Passive, and Ultimate skills that existed before. But be wary \u2013 these newfound powers come with even greater drawbacks. It is up to you to decide if the gift of Vampirism is worth the price\u2026\nImperial City Updates.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Imperial%20City%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Imperial City&lt;/a&gt; repeatable daily quests (available at the tops of the ladders leading out of your &lt;a href=\"alliance\"&gt;alliance&lt;/a&gt; base) underwent significant changes for this update, with the primary goal of making them more friendly for multiplayer, easier to get involved in, and brought up to more modern ESO standards. Note this does not make getting places, fighting monsters, or returning to your base any easier; the Imperial City is just as deadly as it used to be in that regard, so watch your step, bring a buddy or twelve, and be ready to repel enemy players! Or, you know, die and resurrect back at base. You do you.\nHousing Precision Editing Mode.\nHaving trouble getting the placement of your furnishings juuuuust right?

Previously, obtaining the final few pieces of each outfit style could take a very long time, and those\npieces became incredibly rare. These outfit pieces are now obtainable at a steady and standard rate.\nOutfit Style Cost Reductions.\nAfter re-evaluating some extreme in-game &lt;a href=\"Gold%20%28Online%29\"&gt;gold&lt;/a&gt; pricing for certain outfit pieces, we have reduced the gold cost for applying the following Outfit Styles by 50% from the following sets:\nNew Motifs.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Sea%20Giant%20Motif\"&gt;Sea Giant Motif&lt;/a&gt;\u202fchapters can now be obtained from completing the weekly quest for completing &lt;a href=\"Kyne%27s%20Aegis\"&gt;Kyne's Aegis&lt;/a&gt;. The style item, &lt;a href=\"Sea%20Snake%20Fang\"&gt;Sea Snake Fang&lt;/a&gt;, can be acquired from bosses inside the &lt;a href=\"trial\"&gt;trial&lt;/a&gt;.\nGamepad Mode Scaling.\nA gamepad version of the Custom Scale setting can now be found in the gamepad Video settings.

We've also audited the vast majority of item sets in terms of their power, so make sure to check out the itemization section, and bring a snack!\nIn addition to item sets, many abilities have received backend improvements to their scripting to help reduce unnecessary effects, checks, and logic parsing, and will now more accurately follow their described behaviors, such as proc conditions.\nWe've also introduced some new &lt;a href=\"Area%20of%20Effect\"&gt;Area of Effect&lt;/a&gt; (AoE) adjustments to the backend operations to help reduce their messaging and overall requirements to ping an area. Currently, we've only applied this to &lt;a href=\"Dragonknight%20Standard\"&gt;Dragonknight Standard&lt;/a&gt; and its &lt;a href=\"morphs\"&gt;morphs&lt;/a&gt;, as well as some &lt;a href=\"monster%20abilities\"&gt;monster abilities&lt;/a&gt;. We plan to monitor\nthe overall improvements in a real &lt;a href=\"Combat%20%28Online%29\"&gt;combat&lt;/a&gt; environment, then slowly comb through old AoE abilities and apply the changes where applicable.\nItemization &amp; Item Sets.\nAs mentioned in the intro, all item sets have been audited to reduce their implications on performance. Proc sets will no longer do additional range checks on events that already passed one (such as an event triggering off of a &lt;a href=\"Light%20Attack\"&gt;Light&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"Heavy%20Attack\"&gt;Heavy Attack&lt;/a&gt;), will no longer send messages to the server when they fail or are on &lt;a href=\"cooldown\"&gt;cooldown&lt;/a&gt;, and are properly labeled as a proc set to ensure they do not trigger other proc sets. During this audit, we have also brought almost every set in the game under our set bonus efficiency standard, which breaks down a set into its total worth of stats provided, plus modifiers such as how difficult or specific the set is to use/engage with! Due to the staggering size of this list, we've broken up the changes into more specific categories.\nAdditionally, we have adjusted all item sets that have radius checks for friendly targets to no longer target all allies, but instead target &lt;a href=\"group\"&gt;group&lt;/a&gt; members only. This will reduce the amount of parsing and messaging dealt by the server and reduce the staggering power many of these sets can enable in non-grouped content. This change affects the following item sets:"}

These can be found across the Reach, alongside the &lt;a href=\"Solitude%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Solitude&lt;/a&gt; furnishing plans from Western Skyrim. To make room for these new Dwarven plans while keeping the Solitude plans available at their usual rate, older furnishing plans from other styles are less common than usual in the Reach.\nYou'll also find new Markarth-specific achievement furnishings for sale by &lt;a href=\"Tirudilmo\"&gt;Tirudilmo&lt;/a&gt;, as well as a small selection of Home Goods furnishings from &lt;a href=\"Averio%20Brassac\"&gt;Averio Brassac&lt;/a&gt;, both of which can be found in the city of Markarth.\nIn addition to the usual Antique Map of the Reach, there are two new antiquity furnishings to seek out in the Reach:\nBase Game.\nItem Set Collections.\nIntroducing &lt;a href=\"Item%20Set%20Collections\"&gt;Item Set Collections&lt;/a&gt;, a new system to help you find and manage all the non-crafted &lt;a href=\"Item%20Sets\"&gt;Item Sets&lt;/a&gt; in ESO!\n\"Find and collect 'em all!\" With so many Item Sets in ESO, it can be hard to keep track of them all, much less find them. With a new \"sticker book\" interface in the Collections menu, you can easily see all the Item Sets in the game (not included those that are crafted), where they drop, and even their &lt;a href=\"Combat%20%28Online%29\"&gt;combat&lt;/a&gt; bonuses.\n\"A new way to manage Item Set pieces!\" No more storing hundreds and hundreds of Item Set pieces on bank alts. Once an Item Set piece has been collected, &lt;a href=\"Transmute%20Station\"&gt;Transmute Station&lt;/a&gt;s will allow you to reconstruct an infinite number of copies of that piece for only a small &lt;a href=\"Transmute%20Crystal\"&gt;Transmute Crystal&lt;/a&gt; cost or &lt;a href=\"booster%20material\"&gt;booster material&lt;/a&gt;s, depending on the quality.\nTransmute Crystal Update.\nTo better enable you to use the new Item Set Collections system, we've increased the cap of Transmute Crystals! Now you can hold up to 500 Transmute Crystals (or 1,000 if you're an &lt;a href=\"ESO%2B\"&gt;ESO+&lt;/a&gt; member).\nWe've increased the number of Transmute Crystals you can earn from most PvE sources, including &lt;a href=\"Undaunted\"&gt;Undaunted&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Pledges\"&gt;Pledges&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"LFG\"&gt;LFG&lt;/a&gt; rewards, &lt;a href=\"Trial\"&gt;Trial&lt;/a&gt; Weekly Quests, and &lt;a href=\"Arenas%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Arena&lt;/a&gt; and Trial Leaderboards. We've also increased the number of Transmute Crystals you can earn from the Battleground Leaderboards. As part of this, we've removed the small chance of obtaining a single Transmute Crystal from simply slaying the Final &lt;a href=\"Bosses%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Boss&lt;/a&gt; in a &lt;a href=\"Group%20Dungeons\"&gt;Dungeon&lt;/a&gt;.\nWe'll be monitoring how Transmute Crystals are obtained and used in the coming months, as well as your feedback, and may make additional adjustments to Transmute Crystal sourcing in the future.\nBattlegrounds Updates.\nIn this update, we are testing the re-addition of &lt;a href=\"group\"&gt;group&lt;/a&gt; queuing to &lt;a href=\"Battlegrounds\"&gt;Battlegrounds&lt;/a&gt;, where players of group sizes up to 4 can join the queue together and be placed on the same team. Solo players can join this queue, or they can join the solo queue to be matched exclusively with other solo players. With this change, we have also removed specific game types to help promote overall queue health. We've also made additional improvements to Battleground matchmaking to help promote better long-term match making.\nNew Craftable Consumable: Alliance War Skill Boosters.\nWe've introduced a new set of &lt;a href=\"consumables%20%28Online%29\"&gt;consumables&lt;/a&gt;: the &lt;a href=\"Colovian%20War%20Torte\"&gt;Colovian War Torte&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"Molten%20War%20Torte\"&gt;Molten War Torte&lt;/a&gt;, and the &lt;a href=\"White-Gold%20War%20Torte\"&gt;White-Gold War Torte&lt;/a&gt;. These items increase the rate at which you advance your &lt;a href=\"Alliance%20War\"&gt;Alliance War&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Skill%20Line\"&gt;Skill Line&lt;/a&gt;s by 50%, 100%, or 150%, respectively.\nNew PvP Emote.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Rage%20of%20the%20Reach\"&gt;Rage of the Reach&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Emote\"&gt;Emote&lt;/a&gt; can be acquired by combining 30 &lt;a href=\"Siege%20of%20Cyrodiil%20Merit\"&gt;Siege of Cyrodiil Merit&lt;/a&gt;s, available by completing District Quests in the &lt;a href=\"Imperial%20City%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Imperial City&lt;/a&gt;, with a &lt;a href=\"Siege%20of%20Cyrodiil%20Commendation\"&gt;Siege of Cyrodiil Commendation&lt;/a&gt;, available for purchase from Tel Var General Merchants in the Imperial City.\nCharacter Pathing \"Align to Terrain\" Option.\nYou can now choose whether a &lt;a href=\"Houseguests\"&gt;character&lt;/a&gt; should Align to Terrain while pathing in your &lt;a href=\"Housing%20%28Online%29\"&gt;home&lt;/a&gt;. This setting is enabled by default and is the behavior you are already familiar with; it does its best to keep pathing characters touching the floor (or whatever may happen to be beneath them.) If you choose to disable this setting, the character will move smoothly from node to node, ignoring obstacles completely. This is intended primarily for flying &lt;a href=\"Pets%20%28Online%29\"&gt;pets&lt;/a&gt; but can be used in other creative ways!\nClient Optimization &amp; Stability.\nIn Update 28, we've made some improvements to client performance in situations where there are many players using many abilities (e.g. Cyrodiil). These situations are some of the most demanding we have in the game from a performance perspective. Now with optimizations to parallelization, thread contention, and sorting, players in these intense scenarios should see a reduced impact to FPS and therefore a smoother overall experience.\nFixes &amp; Improvements.\nCombat &amp; Gameplay.\nCombat &amp; Abilities.\nBuffs &amp; Debuffs.\nAll Major and Minor &lt;a href=\"Buffs\"&gt;Buffs&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Debuffs\"&gt;Debuffs&lt;/a&gt; have been hard coded to go through server validation sooner and more effectively as cached values, rather than abilities that exist on your character. This new system will also properly ensure that no two same buffs or debuffs can ever stack in effectiveness, rather than needing to be individually spot checked on each application. It will also prioritize duration-based sources rather than permanent ones, so you do not need to fear losing their effects. While doing so, we have also properly reigned in the power of these effects into our Set Bonus Efficiency (SBE) standard; Minor effects are now worth 2 set bonuses (previously between .4 and 4.2) and Major effects are worth 4 (previously between 2.14 and 13.3). The new values can be found below.\nBuffs &amp; Debuffs Value Changes\nNow that these bonuses have been reigned in, we have also made sure to keep item sets in their intended SBE range, so we have done a pass on all sets that source these effects to ensure that. While each of these bonuses is normally worth 2 for Minor and 4 for Major, they are worth .5 less than their original value while sourced on an item set, since they are mainly sourced via the abilities and passives in the game. This ensures if you opt to run a set that grants you a permanent major or minor buff, you'll gain some extra effectiveness on top of that to ensure they aren't completely wasted if you gain access to the buff from another source. We have not done a full pass on &lt;a href=\"class%20abilities\"&gt;class abilities&lt;/a&gt; since the SBE system is generally meant to be designed for non-abilities; that said, we will keep a close eye on class functionality in PvE and &lt;a href=\"PvP\"&gt;PvP&lt;/a&gt; due to these changes.\nNightblade.\nWhile this passive is now in a much better place regarding its accessibility and use cases from &lt;a href=\"Update%2027\"&gt;Update 27&lt;/a&gt;, the class was performing a bit too well in high end PvE DPS. With the adjustment to Penetration, you can expect a little more damage in non-optimized PvE and PvP encounters against high mitigation targets, while tuning back some of their scaling in high end PvE content and specialized gank builds in PvP.\nWeapon.\nThe original intent of the Frost Staff line was to enable &lt;a href=\"Magicka%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Magicka&lt;/a&gt; users to successfully tank in PvE and &lt;a href=\"PvP\"&gt;PvP&lt;/a&gt; scenarios. Many of the tools provided by Frost Staff abilities either did not hold up to other tanking abilities, or directly conflicted with other Destruction Staff abilities. For Update 28, one of our goals was to update the Frost Staff line to address these concerns, making the Frost Staff abilities more in line with our tanking gameplay while also removing the pain points from the Staff. We also added more overall utility to the Frost Staff skills, giving them more viability as a backbar weapon to compliment support and bruiser playstyles."}

You'll seek out these portals, venture into the Deadlands, and put an end to the invading army before it can wreak havoc across all of Tamriel.\nCompanions.\nCompanions are non-player characters who can aid you on your adventures throughout Tamriel. Once called to your side, these stalwart allies will assist you both in and out of combat. Fighting alongside your companion and taking actions they approve of will improve their effectiveness and allow you to build rapport, respectively. As you earn their trust and strengthen your bonds of fellowship, your companion may share personal quests with you. You may also give them companion-specific gear and customize them in a wide variety of ways, including setting their abilities, mounts, costumes, outfits and more.\nWith the exception of quests and rapport, which collectively represents the relationship between each character and the companion, all Companion progress is account-wide. \nRockgrove Trial.\nStone-talkers from the Ca-Uxith tribe have watched over Rockgrove's Xanmeer for centuries.

When enabled, using an ability will display a timer over that ability's icon corresponding to the duration of its effect; this includes abilities cast on enemies as well as friendly targets. You can also enable timers for the back bar which will display smaller timers for abilities on the ability bar that isn't currently active. These options are available in both the Keyboard and the Gamepad UI and are OFF by default.\nNew Monster Masks.\nIn this update, we've added 3 new Monster Masks that are located in the Imperial City. The Masks drop from their respective monsters and from the Trophy Vault chests in their districts. The shoulders can be purchased from the Tel Var Merchant, either in their own individual box or in a cheaper fully randomized box.\nUpdates to Perfected &amp; Non-Perfected Sets.\nIn Update 30, you can now wear perfected and non-perfected sets in combination with each other.

Additionally, there's a fair amount of data that has to be exchanged on the backend for every person in your group. By limiting the group size to 12, we're introducing additional performance gains.\"\nDeveloper Comment:\n\"Currently, Health Recovery is quite powerful in PvP environments as it bypasses the typical penalty of Battle Spirit with healing, enabling those with high amounts of it to easily recuperate tremendous amounts of damage passively. Rather than nerfing Health Recovery as a whole and making it weaker in PvE where it already struggles due to the need of more reactive healing in those encounters, we've decided to utilize this to ensure it only sees a loss of power where it needs it.\"\nBuffs and Debuffs\n[[Dragonknight]]\n[[Necromancer (Online)|Necromancer]]\n[[Nightblade (Online)|Nightblade]]\n[[Sorcerer (Online)|Sorcerer]]\nTemplar\nDeveloper Comment:\nTemplars currently have very few tools that they can use as tanks, so we've opted to utilize a unique scaling method here to ensure the ability can be utilized by both defensive and offensive builds.\n[[Warden]]\n[[Weapons (Online)|Weapon]]\n[[World]]\n[[Guild]]\n[[Alliance War (Skill Line)|Alliance War]]\nDeveloper Comment:\n\"Between the changes to Caltrops and Necrotic Orbs, we hope to see less of a disparity in performance between Stamina and Magicka DPS. We already see many Stamina-based classes pulling slightly ahead to most Magicka in single target, but are quite a bit behind in cleave areas which most of the game requires between boss encounters and elite encounters in dungeons and trials. By reducing the bonuses Necrotic Orbs has from being harder to use and improving one of the universally accessible Stamina AoE DoTs, we hope to lessen the delta between the two in regards of damage dealing.\"\n[[Champion System]].\nGeneral\nCraft\nFitness\nWarfare\nItemization &amp; Item Sets.\nGeneral\nAbility Altering Weapons\nCrafted\nDungeon &amp; Arena\nMonster Masks\nMythics\nOverland\nPvP Sourced\nTrial\nBase Game.\nAlliance War &amp; PvP.\n[[Battlegrounds]]\nArt &amp; Animation.\nGeneral\nCrafting &amp; Economy.\nGeneral\nCrown Store &amp; Crown Crates.\nGeneral\nDungeons &amp; Group Content.\nTrials\nEvents &amp; Celebrations.\nGeneral\nExploration &amp; Itemization.\nGeneral\nAchievements\nHousing.\nFurnishings\nHomes\nHousing Editor\nMiscellaneous.\nGeneral\nActivity Finder\nStadia\nQuests &amp; Zones.\nGeneral\nCraglorn\nDeshaan\nStormhaven\nUI.\nGeneral\nAddons\nGamepad Mode\nGameplay\nHelp &amp; Tutorials\nFixes &amp; Improvements from PTS v7.0.4.\nBelow is a list of some notable bug fixes or adjustments since PTS v7.0.4.

It was the largest update be released at the time for the game, and the update is the size of two normal updates in one.\nThe sixth major update contains a complete overhaul of the &lt;a href=\"Veteran%20System\"&gt;Veteran System&lt;/a&gt; known as the &lt;a href=\"Champion%20System\"&gt;Champion System&lt;/a&gt;, the all-new &lt;a href=\"Justice%20System\"&gt;Justice System&lt;/a&gt; which allows players to commit in-game crime, a revamp of &lt;a href=\"Provisioning\"&gt;Provisioning&lt;/a&gt; and many changes to &lt;a href=\"Combat%20%28Online%29\"&gt;combat&lt;/a&gt;, among thousands of other improvements.\nThe update is roughly 20-25GB in size.\n=Patch Notes:=\nWelcome to The Elder Scrolls Online v1.6, our sixth and largest major content update thus far! We have many significant new features in store for you.\nIn this update, we've added the first phase of the Justice System. This will allow you to commit criminal actions throughout &lt;a href=\"Tamriel\"&gt;Tamriel&lt;/a&gt; such as theft, burglary, &lt;a href=\"Pickpocketing%20%28Online%29\"&gt;pickpocketing&lt;/a&gt; and murdering NPCs. We've also implemented the third phase of the Champion System, which introduces Champion Points and an entirely new UI where you can use these points to unlock passive abilities. We encourage you to check out the details below to learn how both these systems will work.\nAccompanying the Champion System are gameplay improvements, fixes, and rebalancing. This will alter the way you've previously played as every &lt;a href=\"Abilities%20%28Online%29\"&gt;ability&lt;/a&gt; has been amended in some fashion, differences in armor are more pronounced, &lt;a href=\"Critical%20%28Online%29\"&gt;critical&lt;/a&gt; attack and defense are handled differently, and the scale of numbers across the board has changed.\nYou will also notice that there is a new notification when you first log into the &lt;a href=\"PTS\"&gt;PTS&lt;/a&gt; asking which country you're playing the game in. If you're in a non-PEGI country, you will go straight to the game. If you're in a PEGI country, there will be new legal text explaining that the rating for the game has changed, and you will need to either accept or decline this change to continue.\nAdditional new features include the highly-anticipated Provisioning revamp, plus the new Collections UI, improved combat animations, and changes to the Trials Leaderboards. In addition, we have tons of fixes and improvements to all other aspects of the game. We look forward to reading your feedback about everything!\nAVAILABLE TEMPLATES.\nAlliance War.\nGeneral\nAudio.\nGeneral\nKNOWN ISSUES.\nCrown Store.\nJustice System Treasure Items"}

You will need to be at least level 10 in order to enter the Imperial City, but you will be battle leveled according to the rules of your particular campaign. This new PvP space includes the Imperial City Districts and the extensive &lt;a href=\"Imperial%20City%20Sewers%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Imperial Sewers&lt;/a&gt; network. Fight the elite &lt;a href=\"Xivkyn\"&gt;Xivkyn&lt;/a&gt; forces of &lt;a href=\"Molag%20Bal%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Molag Bal&lt;/a&gt;, and increase your might by spending new Tel Var Stones on items more powerful than anywhere in &lt;a href=\"Tamriel\"&gt;Tamriel&lt;/a&gt;! Be on your guard as enemy &lt;a href=\"alliance\"&gt;alliance&lt;/a&gt; members lurk around every corner throughout the Imperial City Districts and Imperial Sewers to take those very stones from you in their own quest for glory! The Imperial City and the Imperial Sewers are aimed at small groups, but if you're highly skilled, you can try going through alone.\nImperial City Districts.\nThe Imperial City Districts are an open PvP area that contains the entrenched forces of Molag Bal, his elite Xivkyn army, and the corrupted &lt;a href=\"Imperial%20Legion%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Imperial Legion&lt;/a&gt;, \"&lt;a href=\"Legion%20Zero\"&gt;Legion Zero&lt;/a&gt;.\"\nTel Var Stones.\nEvery monster has a chance to drop a new currency called &lt;a href=\"Tel%20Var%20Stones\"&gt;Tel Var Stones&lt;/a&gt;.\nWhite-Gold Tower.\nRace to the top of the White-Gold Tower in pursuit of a stolen &lt;a href=\"Elder%20Scrolls%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Elder Scroll&lt;/a&gt;\u2014but is the top of the tower even in Tamriel anymore?

Since Molag Bal ceded it to the worst of his &lt;a href=\"Daedra%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Daedra&lt;/a&gt;, it's become a place out of a horrific nightmare.\nFishing in Imperial City.\nAdventurers will find the moats of Imperial City particularly rife with &lt;a href=\"Fish%20%28Online%29\"&gt;fish&lt;/a&gt;, more so than elsewhere in Tamriel. *However, the groundskeepers normally responsible for tending to these piscine communities are, unfortunately, dead and/or Daedra.

In addition, we've made some adjustments so you can progress through Veteran Ranks more rapidly:\nDungeon Scaling.\nEvery Dungeon now scales up to Veteran Rank 16 which will allow items, such as Monster Masks, to drop at the highest achievable level.\nUndaunted Pledges.\nThree new Undaunted Pledges have been added for Veteran Ranked player characters:\n&lt;a href=\"Glass%20Style%20Motif\"&gt;Glass Style Motif&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe secrets to crafting Glass arms and armor have begun to be revealed!\nInventory Upgrades.\nWe've added three ranks of bag upgrades, bringing the maximum possible &lt;a href=\"Inventory%20%28Online%29\"&gt;inventory&lt;/a&gt; size up to 200 (this includes your &lt;a href=\"Riding%20Capacity\"&gt;Riding Capacity&lt;/a&gt; skill). These new bag upgrades can be purchased at any &lt;a href=\"bag%20vendor\"&gt;bag vendor&lt;/a&gt; with a gold cost that follows the existing pattern for bag upgrades.\n&lt;a href=\"Battle-leveling\"&gt;Battle-leveling&lt;/a&gt; for Veteran Ranks.\nPlayer characters of Veteran Rank 1-13 will now be battle-leveled to VR14 in Cyrodiil if you have the battle leveling option toggled on in the Options menu.

In Wrothgar - the mountainous, ancestral home of the Orcs - you'll find a nation divided as clan chiefs, &lt;a href=\"The%20Reach\"&gt;Reach&lt;/a&gt; marauders, and religious cults all conspire to destroy Kurog's dream of a united Orc kingdom before it can be fully realized.\nTo start your adventures in Wrothgar, go to the starting city of your alliance \u2013 &lt;a href=\"Daggerfall%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Daggerfall&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Davon%27s%20Watch%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Davon's Watch&lt;/a&gt;, or &lt;a href=\"Vulkhel%20Guard%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Vulkhel Guard&lt;/a&gt;. In the city, you will be approached by an &lt;a href=\"Stuga\"&gt;Orc messenger&lt;/a&gt; who will deliver a letter from &lt;a href=\"Forge-Mother%20Alga\"&gt;Forge-Mother Alga&lt;/a&gt;. When you enter the game using a templated character, you will be in Daggerfall, Davon's Watch, or Vulkhel Guard, depending on your alliance. You will be approached by an Orc messenger who will deliver a letter to you from Forge-Mother Alga.\nFinish speaking to the Orc messenger to begin the \"&lt;a href=\"Invitation%20to%20Orsinium\"&gt;Invitation to Wrothgar&lt;/a&gt;\" quest.\nSeek out &lt;a href=\"Ambassador%20Lazgara\"&gt;Ambassador Lazgara&lt;/a&gt; in Daggerfall, Davon's Watch, or Vulkhel Guard. Talk to her to progress the Wrothgar questline and travel to the &lt;a href=\"Merchant%27s%20Gate\"&gt;Merchant's Gate&lt;/a&gt; in Wrothgar.\nYou can also enter Wrothgar through the gates in the neighboring territories of &lt;a href=\"Stormhaven%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Stormhaven&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Bangkorai\"&gt;Bangkorai&lt;/a&gt;, or using the &lt;a href=\"Wayshrines%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Wayshrine&lt;/a&gt; network to &lt;a href=\"Fast%20Travel%20%28Online%29\"&gt;fast travel&lt;/a&gt; to Orsinium.\nMaelstrom Arena.\nJourney into the churning void of &lt;a href=\"Oblivion%20%28Realm%29\"&gt;Oblivion&lt;/a&gt; to do battle in the legendary &lt;a href=\"Maelstrom%20Arena%20%28Location%29\"&gt;Maelstrom Arena&lt;/a&gt;! Designed by the eccentric Demiprince &lt;a href=\"Fa-Nuit-Hen\"&gt;Fa-Nuit-Hen&lt;/a&gt;, this bizarre &lt;a href=\"Daedra%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Daedric&lt;/a&gt; crucible will push even the most powerful adventurers to their limits. It is a contest without allies and without mercy. In the Maelstrom, only the strong survive.\nYou will be granted points every time you complete an arena.\nThe Sigils that appear in each arena can bestow special powers, but each round that you survive without using a Sigil will grant you bonus points.\nIf you complete Maelstrom Arena within 1 hour and 30 minutes, you will be granted additional points. Faster times net increased point gains.\nNew Item Sets.\nThere are new &lt;a href=\"item%20sets\"&gt;item sets&lt;/a&gt; available from a variety of sources!\nNew Public Dungeons.\nWe're introducing two new &lt;a href=\"public%20dungeons\"&gt;public dungeons&lt;/a&gt; in the zone of Wrothgar.\nUnearth the secrets of &lt;a href=\"Rkindaleft\"&gt;Rkindaleft&lt;/a&gt;, a &lt;a href=\"Dwemer%20Ruins%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Dwarven ruin&lt;/a&gt; trapped within a glacier, that has long been the subject of whispered rumors and tales told to frighten Orc children.\nPlunge into the crumbling, abandoned depths of &lt;a href=\"Old%20Orsinium\"&gt;Old Orsinium&lt;/a&gt;, the ancient first location of the Orc capital, destroyed in the &lt;a href=\"First%20Era\"&gt;First Era&lt;/a&gt;. Pass through the three legendary gates - Smelter, Hammer, and Temper - descend into the &lt;a href=\"Caves%20of%20Dark%20Abundance\"&gt;Caves of Dark Abundance&lt;/a&gt;, and locate the sacred fire of &lt;a href=\"Malacath\"&gt;Malacath&lt;/a&gt; that burns deep inside the Temple of Grudgement.\nCrafting Node Scaling.\nRaw materials in Wrothgar will look like (and drop) materials based on the peak of your aptitude in the craft they are associated with. This applies to &lt;a href=\"Woodworking\"&gt;Woodworking&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Clothing%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Clothing&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Enchanting%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Enchanting&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Alchemy%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Alchemy&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Solvents\"&gt;Water&lt;/a&gt; in Wrothgar.\nFor example, if you have Metalworking 9 and Woodworking 1, you will encounter &lt;a href=\"Voidstone%20Ore\"&gt;Voidstone Ore&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Maple\"&gt;Maple Wood&lt;/a&gt; in the wild since your Metalworking level is high, but Woodworking is of a lower level.\nIf your tradeskill mastery is sufficient to work in &lt;a href=\"Rubedite%20Ingot\"&gt;Rubedite&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Ruby%20Ash\"&gt;Ruby Ash Wood&lt;/a&gt;, or &lt;a href=\"Ancestor%20Silk\"&gt;Ancestor Silk&lt;/a&gt;, you will have a chance at encountering them in the world.\nHide that is normally provided by an animal will scale to the Tailoring rank of the player character looting the animal. This is to ensure everyone gets materials they can use, at any level.\nPlayer characters in a group with differing ranks in Tailoring will all get different levels of hide.\nAncient Orc Crafting Motif.\nThe pages of the &lt;a href=\"Ancient%20Orc%20Motif\"&gt;Ancient Orc Crafting Motif&lt;/a&gt; are split between the enemies in &lt;a href=\"Old%20Orsinium\"&gt;Old Orsinium&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Rkindaleft\"&gt;Rkindaleft&lt;/a&gt;, with each Public Dungeon having the chapters that the other does not. Defeating these foes will rarely grant a chapter of the Motif \u2013 or, if one proves exceptionally lucky, the entire Motif book.\nYour knowledge of Metalworking, Tailoring, and Woodworking do not alter your chances.\nOnce you have ten units of Cassiterite Sand, you can refine them at any equipment-crafting bench into Cassiterite, used to make Ancient Orc items. This refining process does not bind the Cassiterite to your account.\nNew Collectibles.\nWe have added new collectibles that you can permanently add to your collection:\nNew Provisioner Recipes.\nDine in style with many new &lt;a href=\"Provisioner\"&gt;Provisioner&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Recipes%20%28Online%29\"&gt;recipes&lt;/a&gt;, four of which revive the true spirit of Orcish cooking as revealed through a series of quests.\nNew Achievements.\nWe have added a number of new &lt;a href=\"Achievements%20%28Online%29\"&gt;achievements&lt;/a&gt; to the game, all tied to Wrothgar. These can be found under the new Wrothgar Orsinium subcategory within the DLC category.\nBASE-GAME PATCH.\nChampion System Updates.\nWe have reduced the &lt;a href=\"XP\"&gt;XP&lt;/a&gt; required to earn &lt;a href=\"Champion%20Points\"&gt;Champion Points&lt;/a&gt; for those with smaller amounts in order to create a fairer gameplay experience. We are also capping the total number of Champion Points that can be spent.\nGrouping Tool Improvements.\nWe have performed a significant mechanical overhaul of the Grouping Tool. It will now find groups more rapidly and reliably when looking for any available group. Below are the first steps on the road to making the Grouping Tool an adventurer's best friend \u2013 look for additional improvements in a future update.\nBattle Leveling Updates.\nInstead of every &lt;a href=\"battle%20leveled\"&gt;battle leveled&lt;/a&gt; character having the exact same stats, you will now be able to mold a battle leveled character however you choose.\nSubtitles.\nSubtitles for your select language are now available! These will be off by default, but can be enabled by going to the Audio Settings, and selecting Subtitles.\nController Support for PC (Beta).\nYou are now able to use a controller that supports XInput, such as an Xbox One controller, while playing the PC version of the game!\nShield Dyeing.\n&lt;a href=\"Outfit%20Station\"&gt;Dye stations&lt;/a&gt; now support the dyeing of &lt;a href=\"Shields%20%28Online%29\"&gt;shields&lt;/a&gt; so you can match your shield to your &lt;a href=\"Armor%20%28Online%29\"&gt;armor&lt;/a&gt;.\nAkaviri Crafting Style.\nThe secrets of the &lt;a href=\"Akaviri\"&gt;Akaviri&lt;/a&gt; crafting style have been uncovered by scholars on the front lines of the &lt;a href=\"Alliance%20War\"&gt;Alliance War&lt;/a&gt;!\nNew Motifs: Mercenary Motif.\nThe mysteries of the &lt;a href=\"Mercenary%20Motif\"&gt;Mercenary Motif&lt;/a&gt; have been unearthed by the &lt;a href=\"Undaunted\"&gt;Undaunted&lt;/a&gt;!\nThe Mercenary Motif is a brand new crafting style, available only through Undaunted activities.\nDungeons &amp; Group Content.\nDungeons.\nGeneral.\nAnyone who has completed these dungeons previously will now have credit for the \"Veteran White-Gold Tower\" and *\"Veteran Imperial City Prison\" achievements.

As a former member of the college, Urag knows &lt;a href=\"Septimus%20Signus%27%20Outpost\"&gt;his whereabouts&lt;/a&gt; and directs the Dragonborn to him. If the Dragonborn collects the Elder Scroll at &lt;a href=\"Alftand\"&gt;Alftand&lt;/a&gt;, it can later be sold to Urag for 2,000 . In , the Dragonborn requires the same Elder Scroll for the quest \"&lt;a href=\"Scroll%20Scouting\"&gt;Scroll Scouting&lt;/a&gt;.\" If the Dragonborn sold it to Urag, he sells it for 4,000 . Alternatively, he can be &lt;a href=\"persuade\"&gt;persuade&lt;/a&gt;d to sell it back for 3,000 . An &lt;a href=\"Arch-Mage\"&gt;Arch-Mage&lt;/a&gt; Dragonborn can purchase the scroll back for 2,000 , if he is far enough in the storyline.\n&lt;a href=\"Fetch%20Me%20That%20Book%21\"&gt;Fetch Me That Book!&lt;/a&gt;.\nAfter joining the College of Winterhold, Urag may send the Dragonborn to collect various rare books.

Princess &lt;a href=\"Urenenya\"&gt;Urenenya&lt;/a&gt; was a daughter, the youngest of three and twenty, to the revered King &lt;a href=\"Uuril\"&gt;Uuril&lt;/a&gt; who ruled from his ancestral castle known as &lt;a href=\"Silaseli%20Ruins\"&gt;Silaseli&lt;/a&gt;.\nNever was a more astute lord than the wise King Uuril, who secured for future generations the power for his family that he himself envisioned in his dreams steeped in ambition. Both rivals and allies of the amicable Uuril were tethered to his family's fate through the marriages the clever king did arrange for each of his children, the two and twenty.\nWhen it came time for the fair Urenenya to wed, suitors did come from lands far and near hoping to link their names to that of the most illustrious king. But Urenenya did not desire to be wed. The lass was of strong will and did even dare to defy her honorable and generous father. King Uuril did with great reluctance lock his youngest daughter within a tower at Silaseli, there to remain until the day of that wedding which he did plan.\nUrenenya's song of lamentation flowed forth both night and day from her locked chamber, until a time did come when the young lass fell ill, and those healers of King Uuril bemoaned that it was not within the power of their art to cure the young woman's maladies. Whereupon that noble king did take pity on the poor princess, allowing her to remove herself from the locked chamber.\nThen: mystery, for Urenenya did vanish, never to be seen again by vision mortal or magical. Buried beneath the soils of Silaseli lie all members of that royal family for generations before and after the good King Uuril, excepting only the fair princess. Mystics querying souls gone before learned that Urenenya's spirit never voyaged to the sweet shores of Aetherius. Somehow the peace of the afterlife was denied her. But were her lost remains returned to Silaseli, it is believed the spirit adrift might find its way at last to that peaceful shore."}

An Ayleid princess named Urenenya vanished centuries ago, and the scholar came here after learning of her connection to the Dwemer architect Klazthgar.\"\nWalkthrough.\nIn the ruins of &lt;a href=\"Klathzgar\"&gt;Klathzgar&lt;/a&gt;, in the central room, you will find the journal of a man named &lt;a href=\"Pelorrah\"&gt;Pelorrah&lt;/a&gt;. This person was researching the tale of an &lt;a href=\"Ayleid\"&gt;Ayleid&lt;/a&gt; princess named Urenenya. He has uncovered that Urenenya was close with the &lt;a href=\"Dwemer\"&gt;Dwemer&lt;/a&gt; who built these ruins. His notes state that he intends to return her remains to the burial chambers where the rest of her family are entombed, or he will die trying. \n\"\"Before I venture further, I must record my findings lest I fail to return. I've spent a century studying the legend known as 'Urenenya's Lament.' The tale says Ayleid Princess Urenenya vanished in life, and her soul has never been laid to rest.\"\"\nYou will find another of Pelorrah's &lt;a href=\"Notes%20on%20Klathzgar%27s%20Schematics\"&gt;notes&lt;/a&gt; in the northern room. This note indicates that while he was doing his research, the Dwemer machines started becoming active. In the west of the room, you will find Pelorrah's Final Notes. In these notes, it is mentioned that Princess Urenenya and the dwemer Klathzgar had fallen in love, and when Urenenya fell ill, Klathzgar put her soul in a soul gem and inserted it into one of his machines so they could stay together. \n\"\"What a discovery! The ancient mystery is solved! It seems the Ayleid Princess Urenenya and the Dwemeri engineer Klathzgar were bound by a forbidden love. This explains her repeated refusals to wed. It also explains her disappearance.\"\"\nYour task now is to retrieve said soul gem. It can be found in the small room in the east of the ruins. The Centurion powered by her soul is no pushover, so be prepared. Once the centurion is dead, take the soul gem from its body and head out of the ruins. Urenenya's family is entombed at the &lt;a href=\"Silaseli%20Ruins\"&gt;Silaseli Ruins&lt;/a&gt; south of &lt;a href=\"Halcyon%20Lake\"&gt;Halcyon Lake&lt;/a&gt;; head there and place the soul gem on the altar. Smash it and &lt;a href=\"Princess%20Urenenya%27s%20Spirit\"&gt;Princess Urenenya's Spirit&lt;/a&gt; will appear. Speak with her to finish the quest."}

Your soldiers failed, Kurog. And so will you.\"\"\nKing Kurog: \"Hahahaha! I love it when my enemies mock me, helps me work up a good rage.\"\nUrfon Ice-Heart: \"You treat everything like a joke! That's why the Orcs refuse to follow you. You mock the fallen and dishonor their sacrifices!\"\nKing Kurog: \"Dishonor? Ha! I'll honor them, by separating your head, from your body!\"\nCombat with Urfon is only initiated when the &lt;a href=\"Vestige\"&gt;Vestige&lt;/a&gt; attacks him, or when the Vestige comes close enough that he detects them in his range. Once he is killed, Kurog will comment, \"How do you like that, you cold bastard?\" He will then take his sword and say, \"Ice-Heart's blade is mine! Now maybe the clans will accept my rule.\"\nCombat.\nUrfon is the strongest boss in &lt;a href=\"Frostbreak%20Fortress\"&gt;Frostbreak Fortress&lt;/a&gt;. As such, it will be difficult to defeat him. During combat, Urfon will conjure multile &lt;a href=\"Ice%20Archer\"&gt;Ice Archer&lt;/a&gt;s to shoot at the Vestige and Kurog. He will also create circular zones spanning over a large circumference which deal a considerable amount of frost damage.\nThere is a simple strategy to defeat Ice-Heart, and is made easy thanks to King Kurog's assistance as a follower. When Urfon summons his archers, it is suggested that the Vestige targets and destroy them to lower the damage output. After that is done, attack Ice-Heart using a ranged weapon while Kurog takes him on during a melee fight, and make sure not to enter Ice-Heart's frost damage-dealing areas."}

To this day, the symbols used to represent the star signs are drawn from Dwemer writings.\nUnfortunately, our knowledge begins and ends there. The few fragments of Dwarven writing that have been recovered are either too short to be informative or too complex to be translated.\nIt's my hope that the Dwemer ruins in Craglorn will shed some light on the origin of the mysterious Mundus Stones that dot the countryside and explain their relationship to the star signs.\nSpecifically, I am using &lt;a href=\"Muhay%20at-Turna\"&gt;Muhay at-Turna&lt;/a&gt;'s invaluable guide to ancient Yokudan astronomy to compare symbology in Dwemer ruins to nearby Yokudan temples to see if I can establish a connection between the more recent observations to those of the long-vanished Dwarves.\nIf At-Turna's theory is accurate and the Yokudans who settled &lt;a href=\"Craglorn\"&gt;Craglorn&lt;/a&gt; were following the star signs, then it is possible that they investigated the Dwemer ruins at an earlier time, before decay and wealth-seeking opportunists had done their destructive work. My hope is that a comparison of Yokudan and Dwarven writings will fill in gaps in the historical record.\nDay 2\nI have been fortunate that this ruin is much better preserved than many I have encountered.\nHowever, this also means I must proceed with extra caution, as the slightest misstep could activate the Dwemer defenses and surely spell my doom.\nDay 6\nI returned to the surface today for supplies. I also sent copies of the few fragmentary Dwarven texts I've discovered in my library. I will try to decipher them later, when I have more time and access to my books.\nDay 10\nDamn it. The defenses have activated. I don't know how it happened. I made certain not to touch anything!\nHopefully, someone will find my notes and can continue my research."}

It has held a degree of strategic and theological importance throughout the history of the various Empires of &lt;a href=\"Tamriel\"&gt;Tamriel&lt;/a&gt;, first under the &lt;a href=\"Alessian%20Empire\"&gt;Alessian Empire&lt;/a&gt; and then as the resting place of the &lt;a href=\"Reman%20Dynasty\"&gt;Reman Dynasty&lt;/a&gt; of emperors.\nBy the &lt;a href=\"Third%20Era\"&gt;Third Era&lt;/a&gt;, the site had been sealed by the &lt;a href=\"Blades\"&gt;Blades&lt;/a&gt;, and is a ruin.\nHistory.\n&lt;a href=\"Alessian%20Empire\"&gt;Alessian Empire&lt;/a&gt;.\nSancre Tor was allegedly where the Slave-Queen &lt;a href=\"Alessia\"&gt;Alessia&lt;/a&gt; received the divine inspiration for her rebellion. At this time it was ruled by an &lt;a href=\"Ayleid\"&gt;Ayleid&lt;/a&gt; king known as &lt;a href=\"Haromir%20of%20Copper%20and%20Tea\"&gt;Haromir of Copper and Tea&lt;/a&gt;, slain in single combat by &lt;a href=\"Pelinal%20Whitestrake\"&gt;Pelinal Whitestrake&lt;/a&gt; during the uprising. Following the establishment of the &lt;a href=\"Alessian%20Empire\"&gt;Alessian Empire&lt;/a&gt;, Sancre Tor became the focus of the new administration, thanks to both its theological significance to the Alessian Order and the wealth of its mines. According to one legend, it is also the place where Alessia was buried.\nFollowing the collapse of the &lt;a href=\"Alessian%20Order\"&gt;Alessian Order&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;a href=\"War%20of%20Righteousness\"&gt;War of Righteousness&lt;/a&gt;, Sancre Tor was no longer the center of the Empire but remained a prominent fortress and religious center.\n&lt;a href=\"Reman%20Empire\"&gt;Reman Empire&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe Reman empire's founding myth states that King Hrol had a vision of Alessia at Sancre Tor, and there made love to the spirit of Alessia or the hillock itself, dying of his labors next to a mound of mud. From this mound was born &lt;a href=\"Reman%20Cyrodiil\"&gt;Reman Cyrodiil&lt;/a&gt;, with the &lt;a href=\"Amulet%20of%20Kings\"&gt;Chim el-Adabal&lt;/a&gt; embedded in his forehead. This account states that this is where Sancre Tor got its name, but this is unlikely given the earlier prominence of the city during the Alessian period.\nReman Cyrodiil is credited in one account with restoring Sancre Tor to prominence to a large degree, by declaring it his tomb and the tomb of his heirs. Reman likely did this as part of an attempt to link his family line back to that of Alessia. Part of this included expanding the fortress' underground passages extensively, including an elaborate tomb complex. This is where the last of the Reman emperors, &lt;a href=\"Reman%20III\"&gt;Reman III&lt;/a&gt;, was buried, allegedly with the Amulet of Kings. However, events during the &lt;a href=\"Interregnum\"&gt;Interregnum&lt;/a&gt; may cast doubt on this.\n&lt;a href=\"Interregnum\"&gt;Interregnum&lt;/a&gt;.\nDuring the Interregnum, Sancre Tor fell into disuse. During the events of the &lt;a href=\"Planemeld\"&gt;Planemeld&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"Five%20Companions\"&gt;Five Companions&lt;/a&gt; retrieve the Amulet of Kings from Sancre Tor, for a ritual intended to make &lt;a href=\"Varen%20Aquilarios\"&gt;Varen Aquilarios&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Dragonborn%20%28Lore%29\"&gt;dragonborn&lt;/a&gt;. Following the &lt;a href=\"Soulburst\"&gt;Soulburst&lt;/a&gt; in 2E 578, Sai Sahan hid the Amulet in Sancre Tor. It was later retrieved by the &lt;a href=\"Vestige\"&gt;Vestige&lt;/a&gt;, and then stolen by &lt;a href=\"Abnur%20Tharn\"&gt;Abnur Tharn&lt;/a&gt; following &lt;a href=\"Molag%20Bal\"&gt;Molag Bal's&lt;/a&gt; defeat and returned to Cyrodiil. Whether Tharn returned the Amulet to Sancre Tor is unknown, but it was somehow returned there between Bal's defeat and Tiber Septim's conquest.\nThanks to its location near the border of Cyrodill, &lt;a href=\"Skyrim\"&gt;Skyrim&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"High%20Rock\"&gt;High Rock&lt;/a&gt;, Sancre Tor was frequently under &lt;a href=\"Nord\"&gt;Nord&lt;/a&gt;ic and &lt;a href=\"Breton\"&gt;Breton&lt;/a&gt; occupation during the Interregnum. In 2E 852, a combined Nord and Breton force occupied Sancre Tor, allegedly in open defiance of King &lt;a href=\"Cuhlecain\"&gt;Cuhlecain&lt;/a&gt; and General &lt;a href=\"Talos\"&gt;Talos&lt;/a&gt;. Talos had secured safe entry into the fortress, bypassing its magical defenses thanks to the help of a turncoat, and took Sancre Tor from inside, after the majority of the defending forces left the fortress in a sortie to attack a decoy force. Despite this attack by stealth, it appears that much of Sancre Tor's fortress was damaged or destroyed during Talos' attack.\n&lt;a href=\"Septim%20Empire\"&gt;Septim Empire&lt;/a&gt;.\nReign of Tiber Septim.\nTiber Septim would later attribute the success of his raid to his destiny to recover the Amulet of Kings. However, he made no obvious effort to restore Sancre Tor to prominence, and the fortress was allowed to fall into ruin. One source claims that this was due to the fortress' poor strategic position. However, he did build an extension to the Reman Emperors' tombs in the catacombs for himself, implying that he did not abandon it as soon as this book claims.\nAn inscription on the doors of Sancre Tor states that the tomb was sealed by the Grandmaster of the &lt;a href=\"Blades\"&gt;Blades&lt;/a&gt; in 3E 35, 3 years before Tiber's death. This was done because of a curse placed on the tomb by the &lt;a href=\"Underking\"&gt;Underking&lt;/a&gt;. As part of this, several Blades agents were sealed within the tomb, and Tiber gifted them his &lt;a href=\"Armor%20of%20Tiber%20Septim\"&gt;armor&lt;/a&gt;.\nReign of &lt;a href=\"Uriel%20Septim%20VII\"&gt;Uriel Septim VII&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Champion%20of%20Cyrodiil\"&gt;Champion of Cyrodiil&lt;/a&gt; entered the tomb to retrieve Tiber Septim's armor. In so doing, they freed the spirits of several cursed Blades agents, who proceeded to break the Underking's curse on the tomb."}

These were not random killings. Only those who fell afoul of the law, who wronged the &lt;a href=\"Great%20Houses\"&gt;Houses of Morrowind&lt;/a&gt;, or who desecrated the sacred teachings of the &lt;a href=\"Tribunal%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Tribunal&lt;/a&gt; were fair game.\nTheir lives were mine to take. Given to me, you might say, because they deserved to die. And I was very good at killing.\nMy victims were mostly unaware that I was coming for them. Some knew they had wronged others: murdered an innocent, stole from the Houses, even bedded another's lover. But they would always claim they had done nothing wrong. That I was mistaken. That I had the wrong man or woman. With a blade at a throat, however, it's amazing how honestly and completely one makes a confession.\nOne after another, I ended them. A swift slice across the throat. The shallow flesh parted, the thin veins severed cleanly. They would try to scream, but they would only choke on the crimson gore that filled their lungs.\nI delighted in death. It filled me with a pleasure I could find in no other activity. This was my life. This was who I was.\nPeople feared me. Loved me. And my brothers and sisters. Pushed us away, and then embraced us as the need arose.\nSome days we were hailed as heroes. Others, as murderers. Those in power fell to our secret blades. And then those who gave us the orders followed.\nBut there was a mistake. A flaw in our process. We had grown too perfect. We had extracted justice from innocent blood.\nSuch is the way, even with the most clear-cut contract. There is always a chance that the law is wrong. That it made a mistake. The contract never lies, but it isn't always correct, either. Even the smallest of actions, harmless as they may seem, can cause a tidal wave of destruction for those following behind.\nA fool's pride veils his judgment. In a moment of passion, blood scrawled upon the wall says it all. \"&lt;a href=\"Morag%20Tong\"&gt;Morag Tong&lt;/a&gt;.\" Those words scream out, loud and insistent. They echo throughout the world, labeling us as ruthless killers that follow no rules, that have no laws.\nThe Tong, always hidden, working in secret, suddenly fell under scrutiny. They wanted to drag us out of the shadows and into the light. We withdrew, deeper into the shadows. Our contracts became fewer, our jobs turned into small tasks. We ran errands for bored House nobles. We endured.\nAnd we obeyed. We remained loyal. We swore on our lives to uphold the cause, and we would not turn our backs on it now, no matter the level of difficulty facing us. Even if the world had turned its backs on us, we would stay the course.\nOur leaders whisper to us. They tell us to practice patience. They assure us that the day shall come when our hand of justice once again reaches out to grasp the world. A coming darkness will soon sweep the land.\nAnd the Morag Tong will once more be needed. Will once again become relevant.\nBut I am old and my days wind down. I prepare for my trip to &lt;a href=\"Vounoura\"&gt;Vounoura&lt;/a&gt;, and I must pass this mantle to someone younger now. Someone less experienced, less wise. My son and my daughter will soon take up the dagger, but they have not seen our greatness. They must forge a new path for the Morag Tong.\nThe darkness of war comes, and no one shall be spared from its wrath.\nThe Morag Tong must put aside the wrongs it has endured. We must be ready."}

Each successful hit by the spell or weapon has a 10% chance of passing the disease on to the target.\nLycanthropy.\nBeing under the influence of &lt;a href=\"Lycanthropy%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;lycanthropy&lt;/a&gt; renders one entirely &lt;a href=\"Vampirism%20%28Skyrim%29%23Immunity%20to%20Vampirism\"&gt;immune to vampirism&lt;/a&gt;. However, &lt;a href=\"Console%20Commands%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;console commands&lt;/a&gt; can be used to become a &lt;a href=\"Werewolf%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;lycanthrope&lt;/a&gt; and a vampire simultaneously; type codice_1 to remove the &lt;a href=\"Resist%20Disease%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Resist Disease&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Effects%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;effect&lt;/a&gt; caused by lycanthropy then become infected with Sanguinare Vampiris.\nResisting disease.\nRacial affinities toward disease resistance decrease the one's susceptibility to the\u00a0infection. For example, &lt;a href=\"Argonians%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Argonian&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Bosmer%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Bosmeri&lt;/a&gt; individuals have natural immunities to disease, making them more difficult to infect with Sanguinare Vampiris. &lt;a href=\"Potions%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Potions&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Enchanting%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;enchanted&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Armor%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;apparel&lt;/a&gt; can also decrease the rate of infection, or even render one completely immune to the disease.\nContracting disease.\n&lt;a href=\"Movarth%27s%20Lair\"&gt;Movarth's Lair&lt;/a&gt; is fairly easy to contract the disease from, due to the &lt;a href=\"Character%20Level\"&gt;low level&lt;/a&gt; of the vampires in the first opening of the cave. This allows for the &lt;a href=\"Last%20Dragonborn\"&gt;Dragonborn&lt;/a&gt; to sustain multiple attacks without dying, so the 10% probability of a success can occur. The shrine of Clavicus Vile and the &lt;a href=\"Haemar%27s%20Shame\"&gt;areas directly preceding it&lt;/a&gt;, and the &lt;a href=\"Solitude%20Catacombs\"&gt;Solitude Catacombs&lt;/a&gt; leading to Potema's chamber, are also potential vampire breeding spots.\nStrategically, casting a continuous vitalization spell such as &lt;a href=\"Healing\"&gt;Healing&lt;/a&gt; or occasionally drinking &lt;a href=\"Healing%20Potions\"&gt;Healing Potions&lt;/a&gt; helps keep &lt;a href=\"Health%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;health&lt;/a&gt; at optimal levels while the Dragonborn waits to become infected. Turning down the &lt;a href=\"difficulty\"&gt;difficulty&lt;/a&gt; or employing &lt;a href=\"Shields%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;shields&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"Mage%20Armor\"&gt;Mage Armor&lt;/a&gt; can decrease the amount of damage taken while the disease waits to take root.\n\"Dawnguard\".\n\"Skyrim\"'s &lt;a href=\"Official%20Plug-ins%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;first plug-in&lt;/a&gt;, , features an area known as &lt;a href=\"Redwater%20Spring\"&gt;Redwater Spring&lt;/a&gt;, a sublocation of &lt;a href=\"Redwater%20Den\"&gt;Redwater Den&lt;/a&gt;, where activating the spring causes Sanguinare Vampiris, and a plethora of other diseases, such as &lt;a href=\"Rockjoint%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Rockjoint&lt;/a&gt;, to potentially be contracted. The location is visited for &lt;a href=\"Lord%20Harkon\"&gt;Lord Harkon&lt;/a&gt;, who requires that the &lt;a href=\"Bloodstone%20Chalice\"&gt;Bloodstone Chalice&lt;/a&gt; be filled there.\nProgression.\nThe disease progresses to full &lt;a href=\"Vampirism%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Vampirism&lt;/a&gt; after &lt;a href=\"Time\"&gt;72 in-game hours&lt;/a&gt; (three &lt;a href=\"day\"&gt;day&lt;/a&gt;s). After enough time has elapsed, messages start to appear accompanied by a brief red flash of the screen, warning that vampirism has begun to take form.

He also has domain over the darker natures of man, such as lust, sin, sloth, gluttony, and greed. He is the patron deity of sinners and is often seen with a bottle of wine or beer (ale) in his hand. Sanguine enjoys playing pranks on others, one such example being a spell that removes the clothing of everyone within the spell's radius. Although a joker, Sanguine prefers to drag mortals down to sinful lifestyles by means of temptation and humiliation. In &lt;a href=\"Khajiiti\"&gt;Khajiiti&lt;/a&gt; religion he is known as Sangiin, the Blood Cat, who is known to test the Khajiit with promises of &lt;a href=\"Vampirism\"&gt;immortality&lt;/a&gt; and debaucheries of the flesh.\nHe has over a thousand personal realms known as &lt;a href=\"Myriad%20Realms%20of%20Revelry\"&gt;Myriad Realms of Revelry&lt;/a&gt;.\nHistory.\nSanguine was once asked by &lt;a href=\"Mephala\"&gt;Mephala&lt;/a&gt; for twenty-seven tokens to give to her devoted followers. The &lt;a href=\"Dark%20Brotherhood%20%28Tribunal%29\"&gt;Dark Brotherhood&lt;/a&gt; stole these tokens from the &lt;a href=\"Morag%20Tong%20%28Morrowind%29\"&gt;Morag Tong&lt;/a&gt;. According to Morag Tong members, Mephala eventually arranged for them to return to the guild. The &lt;a href=\"Nerevarine\"&gt;Nerevarine&lt;/a&gt; systematically killed the members of the Dark Brotherhood one-by-one and retrieved the tokens from them.\nOblivion.\nSanguine can be called upon at the &lt;a href=\"Shrine%20of%20Sanguine\"&gt;Shrine of Sanguine&lt;/a&gt;, whose name does not fit the common pattern of \"(Daedra Prince)'s Shrine.\" The summoning date of Sanguine is 16th of &lt;a href=\"Sun%27s%20Dawn\"&gt;Sun's Dawn&lt;/a&gt;. Sanguine can also be summoned in his shrine, if the summoner offered &lt;a href=\"Cyrodilic%20Brandy%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;Cyrodilic Brandy&lt;/a&gt;.\nThere is a shrine in &lt;a href=\"Cyrodiil\"&gt;Cyrodiil&lt;/a&gt; which bears the appearance of Sanguine. Upon completing the related quest, Sanguine will give the &lt;a href=\"Sanguine%20Rose\"&gt;Sanguine Rose&lt;/a&gt;, a strange staff shaped like a twisted and thorny black rose. When the energy within the Sanguine Rose is cast at a target, one random Daedric servant of Sanguine is summoned to do battle. This staff has very little charge, between 10\u201330 uses, depending on &lt;a href=\"Conjuration%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Conjuration&lt;/a&gt; skill level, and must be recharged often.\nWhen the &lt;a href=\"Hero%20of%20Kvatch\"&gt;Hero of Kvatch&lt;/a&gt; visited the Shrine of Sanguine and summoned him, sometime during the &lt;a href=\"Oblivion%20Crisis\"&gt;Oblivion Crisis&lt;/a&gt;, Sanguine tasked the Hero of Kvatch to join the royal dinner party of the Countess of &lt;a href=\"Leyawiin%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;Leyawiin&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Countess%20Alessia%20Caro\"&gt;Alessia Caro&lt;/a&gt;. Sanguine believed that the Countess of Leyawiin was too stuffy, and wanted the hero to do something about it. The hero should sneak into the castle undetected and cast the spell of Stark Reality on her and her guests. When the hero cast the spell all the guests and the Countess herself were stripped, it brought chaos to the party, but Sanguine was pleased. When the hero returned to the shrine, Sanguine rewarded his Sanguine Rose to the hero of Kvatch, a staff that has the capability to summon a lesser &lt;a href=\"Daedra\"&gt;Daedra&lt;/a&gt; to \"supposedly\" fight for the wielder of the staff. The same artifact was also rewarded some decades before to the &lt;a href=\"Hero%20of%20Daggerfall\"&gt;Hero of Daggerfall&lt;/a&gt;, and also to &lt;a href=\"Martin%20Septim\"&gt;Martin&lt;/a&gt;, the last of the Septims. Martin in his youth was one of the followers of a &lt;a href=\"Daedric%20Cult\"&gt;Daedric Cult&lt;/a&gt;, and he somehow retrieved Sanguine's Rose - probably after some odd task.\nSkyrim.\nSanguine appears in Skyrim disguised as &lt;a href=\"Sam%20Guevenne\"&gt;Sam Guevenne&lt;/a&gt;, who offers a friendly drinking competition with his \"special\" brew for his staff with the &lt;a href=\"Last%20Dragonborn\"&gt;Dragonborn&lt;/a&gt;. If the Dragonborn accepts, the quest \"&lt;a href=\"A%20Night%20to%20Remember%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;A Night to Remember&lt;/a&gt;\" will start. After the Dragonborn accepts and drinks three mugs, Sam, impressed, will give the staff and offers to show the Dragonborn a place \"where the wine flows like water.\" After that, they go out to commit drunken pranks in Skyrim, and eventually the Dragonborn awakes at the temple of &lt;a href=\"Dibella\"&gt;Dibella&lt;/a&gt; and sets out to correct the pranks pulled while drunk. The Dragonborn then heads to &lt;a href=\"Morvunskar\"&gt;Morvunskar&lt;/a&gt; where a portal to Sam's location is found. Going through the portal reveals Sam in the &lt;a href=\"Misty%20Grove\"&gt;Misty Grove&lt;/a&gt;, where he reveals his true identity as Sanguine, commenting that he hadn't had that much fun in a hundred years and rewards the Dragonborn with &lt;a href=\"Sanguine%20Rose%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;his staff&lt;/a&gt;.\nIt is possible to turn Sanguine hostile by commanding a follower to attack him. However, arrows, melee weapons, and spells will still continue to pass through him and he cannot be damaged. Sanguine will simply attack repeatedly for very meager damage with what appears to be a dagger of some sort. This will at least yield a few more lines of dialogue while he attacks.\nOnline.\nSanguine does not appear directly in . However, he seems to exert influence by trapping partygoers within his temple in Shadowfen. His servant &lt;a href=\"Seducer%20Trilvath\"&gt;Seducer Trilvath&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Foreign%20Vintage\"&gt;tasks&lt;/a&gt; the &lt;a href=\"Vestige\"&gt;Vestige&lt;/a&gt; with entrapping some &lt;a href=\"Aldmeri%20Dominion%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Aldmeri Dominion&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Aldmeri%20Spy\"&gt;spies&lt;/a&gt; by making them drink from Sanguine's goblet.\nHe has several followers called &lt;a href=\"Sanguine%27s%20Revelers\"&gt;Sanguine's Revelers&lt;/a&gt;. They can be found in &lt;a href=\"Sanguine%27s%20Demesne\"&gt;Sanguine's Demesne&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Shadowfen\"&gt;Shadowfen&lt;/a&gt;, as well as at a camp in &lt;a href=\"White%20Fall%20Valley\"&gt;White Fall Valley&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Cyrodiil%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Cyrodiil&lt;/a&gt;, and occasionally in &lt;a href=\"Trader%27s%20Cove\"&gt;Trader's Cove&lt;/a&gt;.\nA Khajiiti &lt;a href=\"Vampirism%20%28Online%29\"&gt;vampire&lt;/a&gt; clan in &lt;a href=\"Northern%20Elsweyr\"&gt;Northern Elsweyr&lt;/a&gt; called the &lt;a href=\"Hollowfang%20Clan\"&gt;Hollowfang Clan&lt;/a&gt; worshipped Sangiin, and attempted to drink the blood of a &lt;a href=\"Sahrotnax\"&gt;trapped dragon&lt;/a&gt; to gain great powers."}

Disgusted with the propriety and snobbery of &lt;a href=\"Countess%20Alessia%20Caro\"&gt;Countess Alessia Caro&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"Leyawiin%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;Leyawiin&lt;/a&gt;'s dinner parties, he sends his hero to crash the party by attending in disguise and casting a unique &lt;a href=\"Stark%20Reality\"&gt;spell&lt;/a&gt; to liven things up a bit, by undressing every person in the party. Upon completion of the quest, Sanguine rewards his champion with the &lt;a href=\"Daedric%20Artifacts\"&gt;Daedric artifact&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Sanguine%20Rose%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;Sanguine Rose&lt;/a&gt;.\nWalkthrough.\nObtain a vial of &lt;a href=\"Cyrodilic%20Brandy%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;Cyrodilic Brandy&lt;/a&gt; and go to the shrine, which is northwest of &lt;a href=\"Skingrad%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;Skingrad&lt;/a&gt; and just southeast of &lt;a href=\"Fort%20Dirich\"&gt;Fort Dirich&lt;/a&gt;. Activate the shrine and Sanguine tells the Hero that there is to be a dinner party at &lt;a href=\"Castle%20Leyawiin\"&gt;Castle Leyawiin&lt;/a&gt; hosted by Countess Alessia Caro. This party, Sanguine suspects, will be as \"stuffy\" as Alessia herself, so he sends them to liven up the party with a spell called &lt;a href=\"Stark%20Reality\"&gt;Stark Reality&lt;/a&gt; which they are to cast on the Countess and her guests.\n\"Ah... another mortal come to beg Sanguine to add a bit of spice to an otherwise drab existence.

Have fun!\"\nCastle Leyawiin.\nGo to &lt;a href=\"Castle%20Leyawiin\"&gt;Castle Leyawiin&lt;/a&gt; and walk over to the dining room. Depending on the time of day, the party cannot be entered, as a &lt;a href=\"City%20Watch\"&gt;guard&lt;/a&gt; is posted at the door and will not leave or discuss the party. Around 6:00 PM, he allows entrance. Ask him about the dinner party, and one of several options allows entrance:\nOnce inside the party, cast the spell, &lt;a href=\"Stark%20Reality\"&gt;Stark Reality&lt;/a&gt; so all five guests are hit with it. Attempt to leave as fast as possible as the hero is now being pursued by guards. All &lt;a href=\"inventory\"&gt;inventory&lt;/a&gt; items will be removed. By entering the room while &lt;a href=\"Sneak%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;sneaking&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"Invisibility%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;invisible&lt;/a&gt;, the hero can hide in a corner, undetected, cast the spell and re-initiate invisibility to quickly flee the castle unscathed. If caught, the hero can accept &lt;a href=\"Jail%20Break%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;jail time&lt;/a&gt; or choose to \"resist\" and instead run out of the castle and out of Leyawiin with one or more guards in pursuit. Swimming across the Lower Niben will lose the pursuit. All items are returned at the end of the quest by Sanguine.\nAlternatively, if one raised the guard's disposition high enough, he will take care of the fine for them and they can leave at their leisure. Head back to the Shrine to collect the reward: the &lt;a href=\"Sanguine%20Rose%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;Sanguine Rose&lt;/a&gt; and all inventory items are in a &lt;a href=\"Containers%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;chest&lt;/a&gt; behind a bench.\nThe Stark Reality spell will be removed from the Hero's spell book on completion of the quest.\nConflicts with other quests.\nComplete this quest before the &lt;a href=\"Thieves%20Guild%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;Thieves Guild&lt;/a&gt; quest \"&lt;a href=\"Ahdarji%27s%20Heirloom\"&gt;Ahdarji's Heirloom&lt;/a&gt;,\" as Alessia Caro is &lt;a href=\"Essential%20Characters%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;invincible&lt;/a&gt; until that point. Once \"Ahdarji's Heirloom\" has been completed, there is a small chance that Alessia Caro will be killed, making it impossible to complete the \"Sanguine\" quest. The Countess does leave the city from time to time and can be randomly killed like any other character. If the Countess has died, using the &lt;a href=\"Staff%20of%20Worms\"&gt;Staff of Worms&lt;/a&gt; to &lt;a href=\"Reanimate%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;reanimate&lt;/a&gt; her and leading her back to the dinner party, casting Stark Reality on her and the other guests, allows the quest to progress again. Other dinner guests may die under similar circumstances and can be reanimated and led to the party with the Staff of Worms."}

The ruins of Santaki are actually located south of the city of &lt;a href=\"Sentinel\"&gt;Sentinel&lt;/a&gt; and is northwest of the city of &lt;a href=\"Bergama\"&gt;Bergama&lt;/a&gt;. After the &lt;a href=\"Warp%20in%20the%20West\"&gt;Warp in the West&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"3E%20405\"&gt;3E 405&lt;/a&gt;, the County of Santaki was annexed into the &lt;a href=\"Kingdom%20of%20Sentinel\"&gt;Kingdom of Sentinel&lt;/a&gt;, along with other regions throughout a majority of the Hammerfell Iliac. The local deity of Santaki is Stendarr, who has temples in places such as &lt;a href=\"Cheydinhal\"&gt;Cheydinhal&lt;/a&gt;, the Alik'r Desert, and &lt;a href=\"Phrygias\"&gt;Phrygias&lt;/a&gt;. The regional knightly order is the &lt;a href=\"Knights%20of%20the%20Hawk\"&gt;Knights of the Hawk&lt;/a&gt;, who have chapters all throughout the Iliac Bay.

The Rourken Clan originated from the sub-continent of &lt;a href=\"Vvardenfell\"&gt;Vvardenfell&lt;/a&gt; and left their ancestral home with the formation of the &lt;a href=\"First%20Council\"&gt;First Council&lt;/a&gt;, the alliance between the Dwemer of &lt;a href=\"King%20Dumac\"&gt;King Dumac&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Chimer\"&gt;Chimer&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"Indoril%20Nerevar\"&gt;Indoril Nerevar&lt;/a&gt;. The Rourken discovered the &lt;a href=\"Alik%27r%20Desert\"&gt;Alik'r Desert&lt;/a&gt;, which was rich with resources, Santaki was one of the many minor settlements made to take out the minerals deep within the desert. Santaki would eventually be left abandoned, like the other Dwemer settlements in Tamriel.\n&lt;a href=\"Second%20Era\"&gt;Second Era&lt;/a&gt;.\nDuring the &lt;a href=\"Interregnum\"&gt;Interregnum&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"2E%20582\"&gt;2E 582&lt;/a&gt;, Santaki was under the occupation of the &lt;a href=\"Bandits%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Santaki Bandit Clan&lt;/a&gt;, who derive from the province of the &lt;a href=\"Ebonheart%20Pact\"&gt;Ebonheart Pact&lt;/a&gt; and were using Santaki as a redoubt. The leader of the Santaki Bandits was &lt;a href=\"Tarrent%20Herano\"&gt;Tarrent Herano&lt;/a&gt;, who hailed from the province of &lt;a href=\"Morrowind\"&gt;Morrowind&lt;/a&gt;. Around the same time, a Redguard archeologist named &lt;a href=\"Tharayya\"&gt;Tharayya&lt;/a&gt; traveled all over the Alik'r Desert to locate the lost Dwemer city of &lt;a href=\"Volenfell\"&gt;Volenfell&lt;/a&gt;, the once great capital of the Rourken Clan of Dwemer. An estranged warrior known as the &lt;a href=\"Vestige\"&gt;Vestige&lt;/a&gt; discovered Tharayya's letters in Santaki and traveled all over the region to find her and Volenfell, at the same time, the Vestige defeated Herano, crippling the Bandits, where they eventually relocated somewhere else. Santaki would eventually be settled by a group of Redguards and group into the County of Santaki, which still exists today.\n&lt;a href=\"Third%20Era\"&gt;Third Era&lt;/a&gt;.\nDuring the &lt;a href=\"Warp%20in%20the%20West\"&gt;Warp in the West&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"3E%20405\"&gt;3E 405&lt;/a&gt;, the County of Santaki was under the reign of an unknown Count, whose name was not recorded in the history books. Santaki existed among the twenty-three other nations of the &lt;a href=\"Iliac%20Bay\"&gt;Iliac Bay&lt;/a&gt;. Santaki, itself is in a mainland march that is next to the Kingdom of Sentinel, one of the three great kingdoms of the &lt;a href=\"Iliac%20Bay\"&gt;Iliac Bay&lt;/a&gt;. Later in the same year, the Warp in the West resulted in the Kingdoms expanding their territories, absorbing the smaller nations. The County of Santaki was annexed into the Kingdom of Sentinel along with other regions on the southern coast of the Iliac."}

When Mallory realized she was pregnant, he ran because he did not want to end up a farmer.\nAs a young child, Sapphire lived on a poverty-stricken pig farm with her mother and a man she believed to be her father. One day, &lt;a href=\"Bandits%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;bandits&lt;/a&gt; attacked the farm, killed her unarmed parents, abducted her and repeatedly violated her. One night, after gaining the bandits' trust, she took a dagger and slit each of their throats as they slept. The village remained in ruin for years afterwards.\nSapphire later joined the &lt;a href=\"Dark%20Brotherhood%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Dark Brotherhood&lt;/a&gt;, but left after being recruited to the Thieves Guild by &lt;a href=\"Brynjolf%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Brynjolf&lt;/a&gt;.

After the conversation has finished and she has walked away, Shadr will ask the Dragonborn for help regarding Sapphire.\nIn , it is revealed that, despite her story,\u00a0her father is actually &lt;a href=\"Glover%20Mallory\"&gt;Glover Mallory&lt;/a&gt;\u00a0and\u00a0that\u00a0&lt;a href=\"Delvin%20Mallory%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Delvin Mallory&lt;/a&gt;\u00a0is her uncle.

He will give the Dragonborn the key to his basement, which contains leveled loot, the unique &lt;a href=\"Blackguard%27s%20Armor\"&gt;Blackguard's Armor&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Glover%27s%20Letter\"&gt;a letter&lt;/a&gt; addressed to Sapphire.\nThe letter details how Glover and Sapphire's mother met and fell in love, and how Glover believes he failed her for not being there to protect them when the bandits destroyed her village. If it is delivered to Sapphire, she will give you an &lt;a href=\"Exquisite%20Sapphire\"&gt;Exquisite Sapphire&lt;/a&gt;, which has a base worth of 5000 septims. \nRoutine.\nInitially, Sapphire is rarely seen in the Guild's hideout in &lt;a href=\"the%20Ratways\"&gt;the Ratways&lt;/a&gt; and is most often found above-ground, especially in the &lt;a href=\"Bee%20and%20Barb\"&gt;Bee and Barb&lt;/a&gt;.

They share a fascination for the dark arts, but sometimes I wonder if their friendship isn't too complicated. Father bears such a burden as the &lt;a href=\"Nedic\"&gt;Nedic&lt;/a&gt; High King, and I fear that every time he asks Virmaril for advice he passes a bit of that burden onto my beloved.\nWe haven't told father of our love as yet, but Virmaril assures me that he will ask father for my hand in marriage in the very near future.\nFather was furious. Despite his long friendship with Virmaril, he wasn't at all happy with the idea of his beloved daughter marrying a &lt;a href=\"High%20Elf\"&gt;High Elf&lt;/a&gt;. I'm heartbroken over this, but I must remain strong. I am the High King's daughter, after all, and I have a duty to my father and my people. No matter how much this outcome pains me. And poor Virmaril. I've never seen him look so \u2026 shattered.\nI'm going to marry King Kestic. Father arranged the marriage to help strengthen ties with Kestic and the northern clans. I still have powerful feelings for Virmaril, but I have to put them behind me. Our love is forbidden, and this marriage will make the Nedic clans stronger. I wonder if Virmaril has moved on with his own life yet?\nThe barbaric &lt;a href=\"Yokudan\"&gt;Yokudan&lt;/a&gt;s gather at our doors. I saw Virmaril and father together today. They both seemed worried. Oh, they try not to let it show, but I know them both so well. Virmaril says he has a plan to repel the invaders. He thinks father will support the idea. They just need to convince the other Nedic kings.\nVirmaril was watching me throughout tonight's feast. There was a \u2026 hunger \u2026 in his eyes that I hadn't seen before. Perhaps I'm imagining things, but I could swear that Virmaril had no thoughts about invaders or armies or wars this night. He only had eyes for me.\nVirmaril came to me in the royal chambers. I was hesitant to talk to him at first, but I didn't want to seem distant. He told me that he still loved me. Asked me to run away with him. I laughed at the idea, assuming he was joking. But I could see in his eyes, his feelings for me were as strong as ever. I turned away before my own emotions betrayed me.\nVirmaril was cold today, distant. When I asked if he was well, he just said that I had helped him decide his next course of action. As soon as the meeting of the council of kings is over, I'll find Virmaril and apologize. I never meant to hurt him.\nI'm sure he'll understand."}

I can almost hear your groans - one of my last gifts is to be one of those puzzles I found far more enchanting than you.\nBut I confess I am not entirely certain I ever wished you to solve it.

Now that you have recovered it, please continue.\nThink of what you have done so far. You solved the puzzle in the ledger, you traveled to Abah's Landing, you located a patch of sand in &lt;a href=\"Hew%27s%20Bane\"&gt;Hew's Bane&lt;/a&gt; and dug up and old chest. You managed to get the strongbox open without a key to do it.\nAll of this led you to read my final words. Seeking Lady Sulima in Abah's Landing should be no trouble. She does not know your name, but she has seen your portrait and is eager to meet you. She can tell you the good, strange life I've had with her. And she has a small fortune that will help you get on your feet, once you've graduates from the Academy. You'll be whatever you want to be, and despite my departure, there will always be someone there for you.\nAll my love,\n-S"}
