War is constantly waged under the eaves of &lt;a href=\"Valenwood%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Valenwood&lt;/a&gt;. When the tribes are not raiding the &lt;a href=\"Khajiit%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Khajiit&lt;/a&gt;. in earnest, they are raiding one another for sport.\nUnlike civilized peoples, tribal Bosmer do not fight for any meaningful or constructive purpose. They seem incapable of grasping the concept of fighting for control of land, resources, or defensible borders. Though they may swarm to push out those who harm Valenwood, they evince little interest in conquest for its own sake. Rather, the Wood Elves raid one another for booty, bragging, and boredom\u2014in that order. Tribal raiders typically rustle timber &lt;a href=\"Mammoth%20%28Online%29\"&gt;mammoths&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"thunderbug\"&gt;thunderbug&lt;/a&gt;s. Many &lt;a href=\"steal\"&gt;steal&lt;/a&gt; items (or people) that can be ransomed back to the owners.\nThis erratic, irregular warfare is not pursued to the death. Deaths do occur, but they are incidental and usually regretted. Many raids conclude with no fighting whatsoever. It is considered the acme of skill to slip into another tribe's village and steal an item for ransom without being noticed. The larger the item, the greater the prestige. Thanks to centuries of this practice, the tribal Bosmer have become legendary for their stealth. The title of their most famous poem, the Meh Ayleidion, means \"The One Thousand Benefits of Hiding.\"\nWhen death occurs in battle, an archaic provision of the &lt;a href=\"Meat%20Mandate\"&gt;Meat Mandate&lt;/a&gt; requires that a fallen enemy must be eaten completely before three days pass. This tradition is now only followed in the most remote and savage villages. The family members of the warrior who slaughtered the enemy may help him with his meal.\nThe tradition of the \"Mourning War\" is still followed nearly everywhere outside the cities. When a tribe member is slain, he or she is symbolically replaced via a hostage-taking raid. The tribe will seize a captive from a neighboring band. If the deceased was an especially powerful or prestigious member of the tribe, multiple captives may be taken to replace them.\nAfter a period of physical torture, supposedly to test their worthiness, the captive is joyously welcomed into the clan. This sudden reversal from horrific abuse to loving embrace befuddles the weak wits of a Bosmer captive, who cleaves to his tormentors. Traditionally the victim was given the deceased tribe member's position, possessions, and family, though this practice may be rarely honored nowadays."}

Our war wizards have longed for the ability to lower catastrophic hailstorms onto enemy borders as a preamble to invasion, or to halt a blizzard to make an unexpected march through inclement weather.\nThere are claims to such spells\u2014spells originating from foreign lands and beyond.\nLegend has it that a &lt;a href=\"The%20Greybeards\"&gt;sect of Nords&lt;/a&gt; in faraway &lt;a href=\"Skyrim%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Skyrim&lt;/a&gt; command the spell-like &lt;a href=\"Dragon%20Language\"&gt;language of dragons&lt;/a&gt;, which allowed them some mastery over the weather. Accounts of these Nords' abilities during the &lt;a href=\"Merethic%20Era\"&gt;Merethic Era&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Dragon%20War\"&gt;Dragon War&lt;/a&gt; include the power to &lt;a href=\"Clear%20Skies\"&gt;diminish fogs, mists, and clouds&lt;/a&gt; with the sheer bravado of their &lt;a href=\"Dragon%20Shouts\"&gt;shouts&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href=\"Negil\"&gt;Negil&lt;/a&gt;'s \"&lt;a href=\"Dragons%20at%20Windhelm%22\"&gt;Dragons at Windhelm\"&lt;/a&gt; notes that an army of these bellowing Nords foiled an airborne sneak attack by &lt;a href=\"Dragons%20%28Lore%29\"&gt;dragons&lt;/a&gt; who sought to strike under a cover of storm clouds. Negil writes, \"We thought the heavy clouds looked better parted, and when we spoke our &lt;a href=\"Words%20of%20Power\"&gt;Words of Power&lt;/a&gt;, the clouds thought so, too. But even with their passing, the sun remained hidden. A then-apparent wing of dragons stretched across the blue, and the curse that escaped &lt;a href=\"Vofodor\"&gt;Vofodor&lt;/a&gt;'s mouth brought a hearty guffaw to mine. Our Words of Power did not spare us the battle, but they told us battle was coming. We joined it gladly.\" The &lt;a href=\"Maormer\"&gt;Maormer&lt;/a&gt; lack access to the dragon language, but I have confidence anything the Nords can accomplish we can match.\nFar to the southwest of Skyrim, members of the &lt;a href=\"Psijic%20Order\"&gt;Psijic Order&lt;/a&gt; have been long-rumored to possess spells cast in the &lt;a href=\"Old%20Way\"&gt;Old Way&lt;/a&gt; of magic that can bend the elements to the user's desire. Our scouts have reported sudden lightning and flash rain turning to small-scale blizzards off the coast of &lt;a href=\"Artaeum\"&gt;Artaeum&lt;/a&gt; for years. It's possible instructional texts on the matter exist\u2014and translating them from the Old Way into intelligible magic will be difficult, but it would be an excellent starting point.\n&lt;a href=\"Arresea\"&gt;Arresea&lt;/a&gt;'s \"&lt;a href=\"The%20Daedric%20Primer\"&gt;The Daedric Primer&lt;/a&gt;\" describes a spell devised by &lt;a href=\"Sheogorath%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Sheogorath&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Daedric%20Prince\"&gt;Daedric Prince&lt;/a&gt;, called &lt;a href=\"Manipulate%20Weather\"&gt;Manipulate Weather&lt;/a&gt;. She writes, \"Sheogorath's spell folio includes an incantation to match the weather with his mood. The Lord of the &lt;a href=\"Shivering%20Isles\"&gt;Madhouse&lt;/a&gt; has been known to teach the spell to &lt;a href=\"mortal\"&gt;mortal&lt;/a&gt;s in his favor, allowing them to alter the climate of an entire region. Unfortunately, the spell functions at Sheogorath's whim, no matter who casts it\u2014meaning it functions entirely randomly. There are stories of his followers trying to stymie flashfloods but summoning torrential rain instead, or trying to put out brush fires and feeding the flames with unwanted lightning storms, to Sheogorath's delight. Making a Daedric Pact with Sheogorath is probably not in our best interest, but it seems there is something we can learn from the Prince of Madness.\nI include the above examples to say that large-scale weather control has been noted across the world, to convince King &lt;a href=\"Orgnum\"&gt;Orgnum&lt;/a&gt; or any in his close circle that weaponizing such an ability would be an incredible asset to the Maormer military.\nI set out to prove as much this past winter, with the help of twenty journeyman mages. We didn't quite succeed\u2014though we're on the cusp of success. We started by clearing an open plain near the sea and created a lightning storm by manipulating the charge of a passing cloud with our own skeins of lightning. It worked, but we lost a member of our group (entirely regrettable) to the sudden storm and a fork of wayward lightning. It's possible we would all have perished had our storm not consumed itself. We tried several times, managing to lengthen the duration of the storm each time, even learned to direct it out over the water. But the duration of our spell remained our enemy, and we eventually had to admit that the exercise would be futile in a battle.\nWe concluded that if we had had some way to physically suspend our spell at a high altitude\u2014perhaps with a conduit device? Perhaps a series of devices\u2014we would eliminate the need for continued expenditure of magicka and free the casters to direct a storm across a great distance."}

The war was ended when Daggerfall won a decisive victory during the &lt;a href=\"Battle%20of%20Cryngaine%20Field\"&gt;Battle of Cryngaine Field&lt;/a&gt;.\nHistory.\nThe War of Betony was fought over the region of &lt;a href=\"Betony\"&gt;Betony&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"High%20Rock\"&gt;High Rock&lt;/a&gt;. Betony was a small island, with nothing more than a small fishing village at the edge of the &lt;a href=\"Abecean%20Sea\"&gt;Abecean Sea&lt;/a&gt;. Due to its location and lack of defense, the island, once independent, began to face risks of invasions from pirates. As a result, the island became a vassalage of Daggerfall. While many &lt;a href=\"Bretons\"&gt;Bretons&lt;/a&gt; in Daggerfall held this to be primarily act of charity, King Camaron stated that Betony belonged to Sentinel, citing a claim from over 200 years ago.\nSeveral members of both courts urged their leaders not to enter into a war. In Daggerfall, the court sorceress &lt;a href=\"Medora\"&gt;Medora&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Nulfaga\"&gt;Nulfaga&lt;/a&gt;, the king's mother and a renowned mystic and &lt;a href=\"necromancer\"&gt;necromancer&lt;/a&gt; herself, both foretold doom for &lt;a href=\"Lysandus\"&gt;Lysandus&lt;/a&gt; and Daggerfall if he warred with Sentinel. King Camaron was warned against the battle by his chief counselor, a woman called The Oracle, who foresaw death and defeat in the war, but she was banished from the court. Eventually, Sentinel declared war on Daggerfall. Daggerfall won all of the major battles throughout the war, including the Battle of the Bluffs and the Siege of Craghold.\nBattles.\nBattle of the Bluffs.\nThe first conflict of the war, the Battle of the Bluffs took place off the Daggerfall Bluffs. The sea battle was one of the many victories for the Kingdom of Daggerfall, and it was one of the battles which gave Lord &lt;a href=\"Bridwell\"&gt;Bridwell&lt;/a&gt; his current position as a member of the Court of Daggerfall and the leader of the &lt;a href=\"Knights%20of%20the%20Dragon\"&gt;Knights of the Dragon&lt;/a&gt; during the &lt;a href=\"Warp%20in%20the%20West\"&gt;Warp in the West&lt;/a&gt;.\"\nBattle of the Glenpoint Foothills.\nThe next large-scale battle on the Glenpoint Foothills north of Daggerfall also went to Daggerfall; the Sentinel Warlord &lt;a href=\"K%27avar\"&gt;K'avar&lt;/a&gt; received his disfiguring injury from a fireball cast by a &lt;a href=\"Dunmer\"&gt;Dark Elf&lt;/a&gt; mercenary nightblade.\nSiege of Craghold.\nThe Bretons on the Isle of Craghold were under siege by the forces of Sentinel for several days and a crowd of survivors were hidden away in ruins of the castle before being liberated by Lord Bridwell. The battle went to Daggerfall.\n&lt;a href=\"Riot%20in%20Reich%20Gradkeep\"&gt;Riot in Reich Gradkeep&lt;/a&gt;.\nEventually, Lord &lt;a href=\"Graddock\"&gt;Graddock&lt;/a&gt;, ruler of &lt;a href=\"Reich%20Gradkeep\"&gt;Reich Gradkeep&lt;/a&gt;, acted as conciliator between Sentinel and Daggerfall, and convinced both monarchs to meet and make a peace treaty at &lt;a href=\"Reich%20Gradkeep\"&gt;Reich Gradkeep&lt;/a&gt;. The ill-fated &lt;a href=\"Treaty%20of%20Gradkeep\"&gt;Treaty of Gradkeep&lt;/a&gt; began civilly. However, as the treaty was about to be signed, Camaron became outraged and ordered his troops to riot within the city, starting the &lt;a href=\"Riot%20in%20Reich%20Gradkeep\"&gt;Riot in Reich Gradkeep&lt;/a&gt;. Daggerfall historians claim that Camaron \"realized that the proposed treaty would have included a formal declaration that the kingdoms of Sentinel and Daggerfall would share Betony, and he flew into a rage,\" however, Sentinel historians state that the treaty had been purposefully miswritten by Daggerfall in attempt to trick Camaron into signing a contract different. The entire city of Reich Gradkeep erupted into a bloodbath, with the entire royal family of the city dying, except for one sickly infant, who later died. Lord &lt;a href=\"Auberon%20Flyte\"&gt;Auberon Flyte&lt;/a&gt;, a cousin of Lord Graddock, took control of the city after the riot, and renamed it &lt;a href=\"Anticlere\"&gt;Anticlere&lt;/a&gt;, in honor of the deceased royal family.\n&lt;a href=\"Battle%20of%20Cryngaine%20Field\"&gt;Battle of Cryngaine Field&lt;/a&gt;.\nAs the riot began to die out, Camaron's army left the city, fleeing to &lt;a href=\"Yeorth%20Burrowland\"&gt;Yeorth Burrowland&lt;/a&gt;, with Daggerfall's army pursuing them all the way to &lt;a href=\"Ravennian%20Forest\"&gt;Ravennian Forest&lt;/a&gt; before making camp. A week later, the two armies met and battled at &lt;a href=\"Battle%20of%20Cryngaine%20Field\"&gt;Battle of Cryngaine Field&lt;/a&gt;, the last battle of the war. Prior to the start of the battle, King Lysandus decided that he was going to send in an impersonator to fake his death, so that he could leave his reign of king to go to Medora, who had been banished from the court, and spend the rest of his life with her in ambiguity.\nAfter the battle had gotten started and underway, &lt;a href=\"Skakmat\"&gt;Skakmat&lt;/a&gt;, who under Nulfaga's orders, being sent from the courts to try to prevent Lysandus' death as she had foreseen, created a fog that flooded over the battlefield. As the fog died out, it was discovered that Lysandus' impersonator had been shot either in the heart or in the throat, and was dead.\nImmediately following his death, &lt;a href=\"Gothryd\"&gt;Gothryd&lt;/a&gt;, Lysandus' son, was immediately crowned king behind the battle lines. As Gothryd fought, the battle's tide began to turn, which panicked Sentinel's army. As the army prepared to flee, Gothryd found Camaron on the battlefield, and dueled him. In the end, Gothryd defeated Camaron, killing him; Sentinel historians acclaim this to Camaron being tired from endless warfare, despite being a better warrior, while Daggerfall historians state that the victory was due to Gothryd being a more skillful swordsman.\nAs a result of the death of Camaron, one of his officers, Lord &lt;a href=\"Oresme\"&gt;Oresme&lt;/a&gt;, formally surrendered Sentinel to Daggerfall. On the way back to the capital, Oresme committed suicide. One of the main components of the treaty between the two citystates was the marriage of &lt;a href=\"Aubk%27i\"&gt;Aubk'i&lt;/a&gt; to King Gothryd, in an attempt to relax tensions and try to restore friendship between them. However, many members of the royal courts of Sentinel viewed the princess as more a prisoner of war than a royal marriage to Daggerfall.\nMeanwhile, leaving to &lt;a href=\"Tamarilyne%20Point\"&gt;Tamarilyne Point&lt;/a&gt;, Lysandus and &lt;a href=\"Woodborne\"&gt;Woodborne&lt;/a&gt; were discussing the king's retirement as a group of &lt;a href=\"Orcs\"&gt;Minat orcs&lt;/a&gt; meet the group, which are allied to Woodborne. Woodborne uses the orcs as an excuse to leave the group, and then after they are some ways away, commands the orcs to go kill Lysandus, who do so, and bury the body in a silver casket in a catacomb near Tamarilyne Point. This murder after the Battle of Cryngaine Field directly leads to the events that start ."}

Borgas was killed during one of the &lt;a href=\"Wild%20Hunt\"&gt;Wild Hunt&lt;/a&gt;s of &lt;a href=\"Valenwood\"&gt;Valenwood&lt;/a&gt;. The reason for the Bosmer's assassination was that Borgas, a supporter of the &lt;a href=\"Alessian%20Doctrines\"&gt;Alessian Doctrines&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"Marukh\"&gt;Marukh&lt;/a&gt;, had traveled to &lt;a href=\"Cyrodiil\"&gt;Cyrodiil&lt;/a&gt; to urge the Alessians to launch a joint war on Valenwood. Yet with Borgas' death and no clear heir to the throne, Skyrim was left floundering and leaderless. This marked the end of the &lt;a href=\"First%20Empire%20of%20the%20Nords\"&gt;First Empire of the Nords&lt;/a&gt;.\nOver the years of the Ysgramor Dynasty, the &lt;a href=\"Moot\"&gt;Moot&lt;/a&gt; became more partisan and ineffective. The failure of the Moot to appoint the capable Jarl &lt;a href=\"Hanse\"&gt;Hanse&lt;/a&gt; as Borgas' successor led to civil wars known as the War of Succession. At this time, Skyrim was effectively split down the middle between the Western Holds (&lt;a href=\"Whiterun\"&gt;Whiterun&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Solitude\"&gt;Solitude&lt;/a&gt;) and the Old Holds (&lt;a href=\"Windhelm\"&gt;Windhelm&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Winterhold\"&gt;Winterhold&lt;/a&gt;).\nVery little is actually known about the war. What is known is that the city of &lt;a href=\"Windhelm\"&gt;Windhelm&lt;/a&gt; was besieged and sacked sometime during it.\nThe War of Succession caused Skyrim's influence over many of its dominions to wane. The &lt;a href=\"Direnni%20Hegemony\"&gt;Direnni Hegemony&lt;/a&gt; took advantage of the internal strife in Skyrim, and began taking land north and south of &lt;a href=\"High%20Rock\"&gt;High Rock&lt;/a&gt;, even claiming portions of Skyrim at certain moments.\nIn &lt;a href=\"1E%20416\"&gt;1E 416&lt;/a&gt;, the discord produced by the War of Succession greatly weakened the Nords and caused them to be expelled from &lt;a href=\"Morrowind\"&gt;Morrowind&lt;/a&gt; during the First &lt;a href=\"Battle%20of%20Red%20Mountain\"&gt;Battle of Red Mountain&lt;/a&gt; (the Second Battle of Red Mountain would occur in &lt;a href=\"1E%20700\"&gt;1E 700&lt;/a&gt;). The Nords lost all of their territory in Morrowind, and their armies suffered huge casualties at the hands of the combined &lt;a href=\"First%20Council\"&gt;Chimer-Dwemer&lt;/a&gt; army.\nIn &lt;a href=\"1E%20420\"&gt;1E 420&lt;/a&gt;, the Skyrim War of Succession ended with the &lt;a href=\"Pact%20of%20Chieftans\"&gt;Pact of Chieftans&lt;/a&gt; and the crowning of &lt;a href=\"Olaf%20One-Eye\"&gt;Olaf One-Eye&lt;/a&gt; as High King; however, &lt;a href=\"Skyrim\"&gt;Skyrim&lt;/a&gt; had lost the majority of the territory it had earned during the &lt;a href=\"Skyrim%20Conquests\"&gt;Skyrim Conquests&lt;/a&gt;, including &lt;a href=\"High%20Rock\"&gt;High Rock&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Morrowind\"&gt;Morrowind&lt;/a&gt;, and a large section of the &lt;a href=\"Nibenay%20Valley\"&gt;Nibenay Valley&lt;/a&gt; by the time it was all over.

Rarely do these conflicts escalate from subterfuge and intrigue to all-out war, but open hostilities aren't unheard of in the history of Morrowind. Let me tell you about one of these wars.\nIn &lt;a href=\"2E%20559\"&gt;2E 559&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"House%20Hlaalu%20%28Online%29\"&gt;House Hlaalu&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"House%20Dres%20%28Online%29\"&gt;House Dres&lt;/a&gt; advanced beyond the usual tensions and posturing and fielded squads of combatants south of &lt;a href=\"Narsis%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Narsis&lt;/a&gt;, on the border of the &lt;a href=\"Black%20Marsh%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Black Marsh&lt;/a&gt;. It wasn't the first time these two economic rivals had challenged each other, and it wouldn't be the last, but the actual war was memorable, both in scope and in the number of casualties that piled up over the course of the battles.\nHouse Hlaalu was determined to set up a trading post in the disputed territory. House Dres was just as determined not to let that happen. Halfway through the construction of the outpost, the House Hlaalu workers suddenly found themselves surrounded by Dres mercenaries. The small squad of Hlaalu guards assigned to protect the workers, led by &lt;a href=\"Purilla%20Falen\"&gt;Purilla Falen&lt;/a&gt;, quickly established defenses and prepared to defend the outpost. The Dres mercenaries, who outnumbered the Hlaalu guards five-to-one, assumed they would make short work of the defenders and have the post burned to the ground before the midday meal.\nBut that's not the way it happened.\nPurilla and her guards repelled the first assault with relative ease. She was determined to hold the line, no matter the cost, until reinforcements arrived. To facilitate the appearance of aid, Purilla set the one wizard they brought with them to work on opening a portal to Narsis. If the guards could hold back the onslaught of the Dres mercenaries long enough, an open portal could provide a path for Hlaalu battle-merchants to pour out of to turn the tide of battle. They only needed a little time.\nAs the wizard performed the portal ritual, Purilla and the defenders met each House Dres attack with skill and ferocity. The mercenaries rushed in, sending a wave of attackers at the post's barricades. Each wave was turned away, but not without a cost. After five hours and four separate waves of attacks, Purilla's forces were reduced to a third of their original size. By then only Purilla and six guards remained to fend off the next Dres assault. And the wizard required a few more minutes to complete the ritual and open the portal. \"You shall have that time!\" Purilla proclaimed. \"For Hlaalu!\"\nThe seven defenders, magnificent in their fury, fought with honor and savage resolve as the wizard completed the final steps of the ritual. One guard fell. Two. Four. Now only Purilla and two Hlaalu guards remained at the battlements. The Hlaalu workers, who had been providing support and watchful eyes throughout the previous battles, took to the walls as well, using tools and the weapons of the fallen guards to help defend the post. For all their effort, it appeared that the crushing weight of the Dres assault was about to engulf them.\nAnd then the portal opened.\nHouse Hlaalu battle-merchants streamed through the portal, hurling spells and arrows into the ranks of the surprised mercenaries. A full cohort emerged from the portal and crashed against the wall of Dres mercenaries. The wall held for a few long moments, and then it shattered against the weight of the Hlaalu troops. Dres mercenaries fell in scores before their line finally broke and the remaining mercenaries turned to flee. The battle-merchants chased after them just long enough to make sure they were really routed, and then they formed up to secure the post.\nBrave and noble Purilla Falen was responsible for the Hlaalu victory that day, but she didn't survive the final battle. A Dres mercenary's blade had caught her in the neck as they were retreating. She was dead before a healer could reach her side. Thanks to histories like these, however, her efforts will never be forgotten."}

Mistrust of both the &lt;a href=\"Third%20Empire\"&gt;Empire&lt;/a&gt; and Summerset for support, as well as mistrust in its own government for guidance, the Bosmer had become isolationalist. Its people left the cities and returned to the forests, practicing their old traditions. Because of this weakness the &lt;a href=\"Khajiit\"&gt;Khajiit&lt;/a&gt;s invaded in what is now known as the &lt;a href=\"Five%20Year%20War\"&gt;Five Year War&lt;/a&gt;, while the Altmer attacked during the War of the Blue Divide.\nThe War.\nWith the Empire unwilling to provide the Bosmer with aid from the &lt;a href=\"Imperial%20Legion\"&gt;Imperial Legion&lt;/a&gt;, Valenwood was left to fend for itself in two wars on two fronts. \nFew details are given regarding the war itself. One of the pieces of information provided is that the Altmer supported the Parikh Tribe, who rampaged through southeastern Valenwood with their aid, managing to push some of the other tribes to the north of Valenwood. The Tribe was also involved in scouting out enemy Bosmer camps. Only one besieging was recorded during the war, that being the Altmeri siege on &lt;a href=\"Woodhearth\"&gt;Woodhearth&lt;/a&gt;. The siege itself was poorly planned, however, as the Altmer decided to siege the city for as long as it took to starve its population, or force its surrender. Because of the &lt;a href=\"Green%20Pact\"&gt;Green Pact&lt;/a&gt;, however, this could have lasted until only one Bosmer remained. During the war the Altmer had also destroyed many of the harbors belonging to Valenwood. The war would eventually end when the Altmer and Bosmer had come to peace, with the Altmer now having gained several coastal islands from the Bosmer."}

The conflicts turned to war following the discovery of the &lt;a href=\"Heart%20of%20Lorkhan\"&gt;Heart of Lorkhan&lt;/a&gt; by the Chimer, culminating in the legendary &lt;a href=\"Battle%20of%20Red%20Mountain\"&gt;Battle of Red Mountain&lt;/a&gt;, which saw the disappearance of the Dwemer and destruction of &lt;a href=\"House%20Dagoth\"&gt;House Dagoth&lt;/a&gt;.\nPrelude.\nPrior to the war, the Chimer and Dwemer had united under &lt;a href=\"Nerevar\"&gt;Nerevar&lt;/a&gt; to drive out the &lt;a href=\"Nords\"&gt;Nords&lt;/a&gt; from Resdayn during the Nordic &lt;a href=\"War%20of%20Succession\"&gt;War of Succession&lt;/a&gt;. This marked the founding of the Great Houses, which one source divides into \"orthodox\" and \"secular\", with Houses &lt;a href=\"House%20Dres\"&gt;Dres&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"House%20Hlaalu\"&gt;Hlaalu&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"House%20Indoril\"&gt;Indoril&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"House%20Redoran\"&gt;Redoran&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"House%20Telvanni%20%28Morrowind%29\"&gt;House Telvanni&lt;/a&gt; comprise the former, and &lt;a href=\"House%20Dagoth\"&gt;House Dagoth&lt;/a&gt; and \"House Dwemer\" comprise the latter.\nDiscovery of the heart of Lorkhan.\nSeveral accounts attribute the war to simple cultural differences between the Dwemer and the Chimer that were too great to allow for peace. The event that began the march to war was the discovery by House Dagoth that the Dwemer had discovered the Heart of Lorkhan beneath &lt;a href=\"Red%20Mountain\"&gt;Red Mountain&lt;/a&gt;.\nThis led to heated negotiations between Nerevar and &lt;a href=\"Dumac%20Dwarfking\"&gt;Dumac Dwarfking&lt;/a&gt;. Upon being told by &lt;a href=\"Azura\"&gt;Azura&lt;/a&gt; that the Dwemer were building a &lt;a href=\"Numidium\"&gt;new god&lt;/a&gt; under the mountain, Nerevar and the &lt;a href=\"Tribunal\"&gt;Tribunal&lt;/a&gt; issued an ultimatum to the Dwemer to stop work on their new god, or face destruction. Dumac, ignorant of the work &lt;a href=\"Kagrenac\"&gt;Kagrenac&lt;/a&gt; had done on the Heart, refused. And so the Chimer and Dwemer went to war.\nEvents of the war.\nThe exact events of the war are unknown, as there are various conflicting accounts on what happened. One account notes that the Orthodox Houses suffered defeat after defeat until Nerevar was made commander of the army, whereupon the Dwemer were outmanoeuvred thanks to the use of Ashlander scouts, forcing a last stand at Red Mountain. However, other sources suggest that Nerevar was leading troops at the start of the war, and that the majority Dwemer troops were in fact led away from Red Mountain so that the Tribunal and Nerevar could enter Red Mountain uninterrupted.\nWith the Chimer and the Dwemer fighting among themselves in the First Era, the Nords either saw an opportunity to regain their old dominions and invaded, or were invited to participate in the war by &lt;a href=\"House%20Dagoth\"&gt;House Dagoth&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Dwemer\"&gt;Dwemer&lt;/a&gt;. The &lt;a href=\"Tongues\"&gt;Tongues&lt;/a&gt; who led this war summoned &lt;a href=\"Shor\"&gt;Shor&lt;/a&gt;, who summoned a resurrected &lt;a href=\"Wulfharth\"&gt;Wulfharth&lt;/a&gt; to lead the Nords. One tale claims that the Nords and Wulfharth were at Red Mountain to reclaim the &lt;a href=\"Heart%20of%20Shor\"&gt;Heart of Shor&lt;/a&gt;.\nAll accounts note that the war culminated in the Battle of Red Mountain.\nBelligerents.\nSome accounts claim that the war was a simple conflict of the Dwemer and Chimer, while others note the involvement of the Nords, Orcs, and Khajiit in the conflict. Similarly, some books claim that House Dagoth was allied to the Dwemer, rather than fighting alongside the Chimer. Other accounts claim House Dagoth was allied with King &lt;a href=\"Wulfharth\"&gt;Wulfharth&lt;/a&gt;'s Nord-orc army.\nBattle of Red Mountain.\nAccounts of the Battle of Red Mountain in 1E 700 vary, and state that the battle was either the last stand of the Dwemer, an attack contrived by leading the bulk of the Dwemer away from Red Mountain, a pitched battle where the Chimer and Dwemer armies (and any potential allies) simply met in pitched battle., or a massive battle between the Chimer-Dwemer alliance and Wulfharth's Nord-orc crusaders.\nDuring the battle, there was a major standoff at the chamber where the Heart of Lorkhan was kept. One tale claims Nerevar, the Tribunal and Dagoth Ur snuck into the chamber where the Heart of Lorkhan was kept, and confront Dumac and Kagrenac. Another version claims Wulfharth \"rode\" the Khajiit hero Dro'Zira up the Red Mountain itself to strike at the heart of the Chimer. In the chamber, Wulfharth had obtained the Heart but needed time to acclimate to its power. During this time, he and Voryn Dagoth faced Nerevar and his two companions, &lt;a href=\"Alandro%20Sul\"&gt;Alandro Sul&lt;/a&gt; and Dumac Dwarfking and was said to have fell in this fight. In the ensuing battle, Dumac is killed, although precisely who killed Dumac is uncertain. Some sources claim Nerevar, others &lt;a href=\"Wulfharth\"&gt;Wulfharth&lt;/a&gt;, and yet others a Khajiit called &lt;a href=\"Dro%27Zira\"&gt;Dro'Zira&lt;/a&gt;. Sources are similarly unclear as to whether Nerevar was killed during the battle, died from his wounds after the battle, or was murdered by the Tribunal. And Wulfharth, if he had been at the battle at all, either died at the Heart's chamber after being weakened by &lt;a href=\"Dumac\"&gt;Dumac&lt;/a&gt; and slained by &lt;a href=\"Indoril%20Nerevar\"&gt;Indoril Nerevar&lt;/a&gt;, or blasted away into ashes by &lt;a href=\"Vivec\"&gt;Vivec&lt;/a&gt; if Voryn Dagoth led his army into a trap. \nAll available sources agree, however, that the Dwemer disappeared during the battle. This is either because Kagrenac turned his Tools on the heart, or because &lt;a href=\"Azura\"&gt;Azura&lt;/a&gt; told Nerevar and the Tribunal how to use the tools to banish the Dwemer. House Dagoth was also destroyed either in this battle or in its immediate aftermath."}

The First Council was the first pan-Dunmer governing body, which collapsed over disputes about sorceries and enchantments practiced by the Dwemer and declared profane by the other Houses.\nThe Secular Houses, less numerous, but politically and magically more advanced, and aided by &lt;a href=\"Nord\"&gt;Nord&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Orc\"&gt;Orc&lt;/a&gt; clans drawn by promise of land and booty, initially campaigned with great success in the north of &lt;a href=\"Morrowind\"&gt;Morrowind&lt;/a&gt;, and occupied much of the land now comprising Redoran, &lt;a href=\"Vvardenfell\"&gt;Vvardenfell&lt;/a&gt;, and Telvanni District. The Orthodox Houses, widely dispersed and poorly organized, suffered defeat after defeat until &lt;a href=\"Nerevar\"&gt;Nerevar&lt;/a&gt; was made general of all House troops and levies.\nNerevar secured the aid of nomad barbarian tribesmen, and contrived to force a major battle at the Secular stronghold of &lt;a href=\"Red%20Mountain\"&gt;Red Mountain&lt;/a&gt; on Vvardenfell. The Secular forces were outmaneuvered and defeated with the help of &lt;a href=\"Ashlanders%20%28Morrowind%29\"&gt;Ashlanders&lt;/a&gt; scouts, and the survivors forced to take refuge in the Dwemer stronghold at Red Mountain.\nAfter a brief siege, treason permitted Nerevar and his troops to enter the stronghold, where the Secular leaders were slain, and Nerevar mortally wounded. General slaughter followed, and Houses Dwemer and Dagoth were exterminated. Nerevar died shortly thereafter of his wounds.\nThree of Nerevar's associates among the Orthodox Houses, &lt;a href=\"Vivec\"&gt;Vivec&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Almalexia\"&gt;Almalexia&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Sotha%20Sil\"&gt;Sotha Sil&lt;/a&gt;, succeeded to control of the re-created First Council, renamed the Grand Council of Morrowind, and went on to be come the god-kings and immortal rulers of Morrowind known as the &lt;a href=\"Tribunal\"&gt;Tribunal&lt;/a&gt;, or Almsivi."}

The &lt;a href=\"Septim%20Empire\"&gt;Empire&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Psijic%20Order\"&gt;Psijic Order&lt;/a&gt; were also involved in the war, as the Maormer meant to later invade the continent of &lt;a href=\"Tamriel\"&gt;Tamriel&lt;/a&gt; in an alliance with &lt;a href=\"Potema%20Septim\"&gt;Potema Septim&lt;/a&gt;. However, the &lt;a href=\"Maormer\"&gt;Sea Elves&lt;/a&gt; were ultimately unsuccessful in this venture and were pushed back to Pyandonea.\nHistory.\nOrigins.\nThree months before the War of the Isle, a ship boarded by Maormer and King &lt;a href=\"Orgnum\"&gt;Orgnum&lt;/a&gt; arrived at the city of &lt;a href=\"Solitude\"&gt;Solitude&lt;/a&gt; to meet with Potema Septim. During this time, Potema made an agreement with Orgnum that when the Maormer took over &lt;a href=\"Tamriel\"&gt;Tamriel&lt;/a&gt;, she would become Empress of the continent and lead an insurrection against her brother, &lt;a href=\"Emperor\"&gt;Emperor&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Antiochus%20Septim\"&gt;Antiochus Septim&lt;/a&gt;. The Maormer agreed to do this for eight million gold pieces, before leaving en route to the Summerset Isles and the imminent invasions.\nPyandonean Invasion.\nWhile the \"&lt;a href=\"Pocket%20Guide%20to%20the%20Empire\"&gt;Pocket Guide to the Empire&lt;/a&gt;\" states that the Altmer had to call upon the aid of the Psijic Order and the Empire to help defend themselves, it was the Emperor who originally asked for the Psijic's support in defending the west coast of Tamriel from the Pyandonean fleet. The Psijic's offered their services at fifty million &lt;a href=\"Septim%20%28Coin%29\"&gt;gold&lt;/a&gt; pieces, although upon reflection of the dangers that a Pyandonean invasion would have, they accepted his earlier offer of twelve million.\nThe united alliance of the kings of Summerset, Antiochus Septim, and the Psijic Order, combining the Imperial fleet, the royal navies of Summerset, and the Psijic's magical powers, succeeded in destroying the Pyandonean invading armada. \"&lt;a href=\"Brief%20History%20of%20the%20Empire\"&gt;A Brief History of the Empire&lt;/a&gt;\" states that it was a freak storm which defeated King Orgnum, and legend credits the Psijic Order for conjuring the storm. However, the \"Brief History of the Empire\" books were published during the rule of &lt;a href=\"Uriel%20Septim%20VII\"&gt;Uriel Septim VII&lt;/a&gt;, who is known to have been suspicious enough of the Psijics to refuse ambassadors from &lt;a href=\"Artaeum\"&gt;Artaeum&lt;/a&gt; within the &lt;a href=\"Imperial%20City\"&gt;Imperial City&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe War of the Isle was the last documented appearance of King Orgnum and the Maormer.\u00a0It was said that the storm\u00a0annihilated Orgnum's fleet, so that he was never again able to muster together enough of a force to dare another battle, although Orgnum may have also been destroyed with his fleet.\nAftermath.\nThe War of the Isle was Emperor Antiochus Septim's greatest victory, although the Maormer were very nearly successful in conquering their ancient enemy, and almost took the province of Summerset away from Tamriel. While &lt;a href=\"Valenwood\"&gt;Valenwood&lt;/a&gt; was left unscathed, the War of the Isle ravaged the Summerset Isles, leading many young High Elves to begin taking a more critical view of Altmer society."}

Once this failed to stop her coronation, he instead gathered the armies loyal to him, those of &lt;a href=\"High%20Rock\"&gt;High Rock&lt;/a&gt;, northern &lt;a href=\"Morrowind\"&gt;Morrowind&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Skyrim\"&gt;Skyrim&lt;/a&gt;, and attacked the Empire, alongside his mother, &lt;a href=\"Potema%20Septim\"&gt;Potema Septim&lt;/a&gt;, who later became known as the Wolf Queen of Solitude. There was a long time period during which he was conquering the Empire. This battle became known as the War of the Red Diamond, after &lt;a href=\"Tiber%20Septim\"&gt;Tiber Septim&lt;/a&gt;'s famous diamond. Evidence suggests that this diamond belonged to Saint &lt;a href=\"Alessia\"&gt;Alessia&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe participants.\nOn &lt;a href=\"Uriel%20Septim%20III\"&gt;Uriel III&lt;/a&gt;'s side, there was his mother, &lt;a href=\"Potema%20Septim\"&gt;Potema&lt;/a&gt;, and the forces of High Rock, northern Morrowind, Skyrim, and various kings from the other provinces. On the opposing side, there was Empress &lt;a href=\"Kintyra%20Septim%20II\"&gt;Kintayra II&lt;/a&gt;, her Uncles &lt;a href=\"Cephorus%20Septim%20II\"&gt;Cephorus&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Magnus%20Septim\"&gt;Magnus&lt;/a&gt;, and the majority of the kings from &lt;a href=\"Hammerfell\"&gt;Hammerfell&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Summerset%20Isles\"&gt;Summerset Isles&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Valenwood\"&gt;Valenwood&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Elsweyr\"&gt;Elsweyr&lt;/a&gt;, and the &lt;a href=\"Black%20Marsh\"&gt;Black Marsh&lt;/a&gt;.\nPrelude.\nAfter the coronation of &lt;a href=\"Kintyra%20Septim%20II\"&gt;Kintayra II&lt;/a&gt; in 3E 120, Uriel coordinated a series of three attacks against the Empire. He first attacked High Rock, forcing Kintayra to mobilize her army and march to this area. She was betrayed by the Duke of Glenpoint and captured. Uriel then attacked Imperial forts along the eastern islands of &lt;a href=\"Morrowind\"&gt;Morrowind&lt;/a&gt;. With the Imperial army split in an attempt to defend High Rock and Morrowind, Uriel's forces marched on the Imperial City and took it after a fortnight. Uriel was crowned Emperor, and the war of the Red Diamond began in the year 3E 121.\nThe War.\nIn the year 3E 125, Cephorus Septim took Western High Rock, prompting the execution of Kintayra. Magnus, meanwhile, marched an army of Argonians through Morrowind in the year 3E 127 and occupied &lt;a href=\"Kogmenthist%20Castle\"&gt;Kogmenthist Castle&lt;/a&gt; in Skyrim. Uriel in turn marched an army to Hammerfell to engage Cephorus and was defeated and captured by Cephorus in the &lt;a href=\"Battle%20of%20Ichidag\"&gt;Battle of Ichidag&lt;/a&gt;, while Potema defeated Magnus's army in the &lt;a href=\"Battle%20of%20Falconstar\"&gt;Battle of Falconstar&lt;/a&gt;. While Uriel was on his way to the city of &lt;a href=\"Gilane\"&gt;Gilane&lt;/a&gt; for trial, a group of vigilantes attacked and slew Uriel. Cephorus was then crowned Emperor.\nPotema would continue fighting for the next 10 years, but the death of her son cost her many allies, and as she suffered defeat after defeat was forced to resort to Daedra. She summoned massive armies of undead, but to no avail. Her capital of Solitude was besieged and after Magnus stormed and took the castle, the war was finally over.\nNotable battles.\nThe Battle of Falconstar.\nIn &lt;a href=\"3E%20127\"&gt;3E 127&lt;/a&gt;, as the Argonian forces under Magnus Septim were stationed in Kogmenthist Castle, Queen Potema and Lord Vhokken launched an attack with their Legions, beating back Magnus in the process. When Potema heard of her son being captured, she became enraged, and decided to lead the assault herself, which proved succesful, resulting in Magnus fleeing with his army.\nThe Battle of Ichidag.\nThis battle was fought between the Imperial Legion under Uriel Septim III and Cephorus Septim in &lt;a href=\"3E%20127\"&gt;3E 127&lt;/a&gt;. While Uriel fought bravely, his men were outmatched and he was brought to Gilane after being captured. It later became clear that Uriel Septim III had been killed by an angry mob in Hammerfell, and Cephorus Septim was being proclaimed Emperor. As a result of the death of Uriel III, many of the allies of Potema turned against them, in favor of the new Emperor.\nSiege of Solitude.\nThe last battle in the War of the Red Diamond, fought in &lt;a href=\"3E%20127\"&gt;3E 137&lt;/a&gt;. After numerous defeats Potema started signing pacts with the Daedra and had necromancers resurrect her fallen forces, which were used to fight battle after battle against Magnus and Cephorus Septim's forces. In &lt;a href=\"3E%20137\"&gt;3E 137&lt;/a&gt;, Potema's forces had been pushed back to the Blue Palace, with the city falling to the Empire again. During the siege, Potema gave &lt;a href=\"Pelagius%20the%20Mad\"&gt;Pelagius Septim&lt;/a&gt; a necklace that would slowly drive him to insanity. Potema at this point knew from the Elder Scrolls that Pelagius would become Emperor and she so instigated one final act of revenge on the Empire."}

Ships spotted, they say, full of invaders. The same invaders, they say, that have recently come to the southern &lt;a href=\"Hammerfell%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Deathlands&lt;/a&gt;.\nIt seems like every day there is some new invader. We have withstood previous attackers. Our water is coveted in the desert, but the rock and sand protect us\u2014and so do the &lt;a href=\"Nereid%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Nereids&lt;/a&gt;. I do not think this time will be any different.\nWord comes that the invaders are unrelenting. Their leader has a name. Tarish-Zi. It's an ugly name, I say, but Merrina wonders what it matters if the name is ugly? I am not worried about being conquered by a general with an ugly name.\nToday General Zal'ik made an announcement. Tarish-Zi and his army are coming, but the Nereids have pledged to protect us. He told us not to worry, but I wasn't worried, anyway.\nThe city is in panic. Word reached us that the forces Zal'ik sent to meet the oncoming enemy were slaughtered. Not a soldier survived except for one wounded lieutenant, sent to bring word of Tarish-Zi's coming. They say the enemy's army is immortal. They say Tarish-Zi himself is immortal. I don't believe it, but for the first time I feel anxious about this impending attack.\nGeneral Zal'ik ordered everyone to take up arms in defense of the city, so I fashioned a mace from a broom handle and an old hammer. (The blacksmith is overtasked and there are not enough weapons to go around for all of us.)\nEverywhere there is a sense of foreboding, that this really is the end. Our city, which has weathered so many invasions, will finally fall. But there is also a feeling of deep friendship. The petty squabbles that used to fill the marketplace with so much noise have been replaced with words of friendship and encouragement. If we will die, we will die together.\nRumor is that General Zal'ik has turned to the Nereids for help. Everyone hopes that Shada and her daughters will intervene on our behalf. Our only hope requires a miracle.\n\"[The rest of the journal is too waterlogged to be legible.]\""}

She asked me to save her friend, Nahlia, who was captured by the mad researchers.\"\nWalkthrough.\nIn the city wing of Shada's Tear, in the first room on the balcony, you will find a woman named Ralai. She will tell you that she and her fellow researcher Nahlia refused to drink the water here. The others who did drink the water went crazy and kidnapped Nahlia to sacrifice her to &lt;a href=\"Shada\"&gt;Shada&lt;/a&gt;. Ralai will ask for your help in freeing Nahlia. \nThe kidnappers went through the door up ahead, but to get through you must solve a puzzle. To solve it, read the text on the table near Ralai. It will tell you:\n\"From this vantage, I see the lights that guide the way. Look only to that which shines to show you the true way. Darkness only holds lies.\"\nHead to the door to the south and use the wheels by its side to solve the puzzle; the solution is . Once the door to the inner city is open, head through. Ralai will not follow you through these chambers because of all the undead, but you can speak wit her for information about the leaders of the research team that drank the water. Either way, head on theough the corridors and into the room in the southwest; you will find the researcher Klaus here. Klaus has a horn that he can use to summon undead to his aid; beware of this and try not to get overwhelmed. Once you have defeated him and free his soul, you can talk to him. he will tell you that Nahlia is being held in the final chamber to be sacrificed to Shada. \nHead on east through the corridor, then heae right into the southernmost room. Here, you will find the researcher Squan, alongside many daedric portals. Squan will summon daedra from these portals, but he is not nearly as persistent with this as Klaus is with his undead. Just kill the daedra as they appear and then focus your attention on Squan again. Squan also likes to throw a big fireball at you that deals massive damage; make sure you stay healed in case this hits. After the battle, if you speak to Squan's soul, he will tell you that you need two people to unlock Nahlia's prison; they have to turn the locks at the same time. This dialogue is a leftover from before the One Tamriel update; you do not need two people to do this quest.\nOnly one researcher remains: Zifri. She can be found in the room to the east. Zifri will occasionally start working the forge in the room, when she is done with this, she will say something about purging the fire with water and unleash a very powerful attack. Make sure you are in good health when she does this. The further you are from Zifri when she does this, the less damage you will take from her attack. Once she is defeated, speak with her and you will learn that you must look for the faces on the stone pillars to free Nahlia. \nHead onward through the hallway until you reach the room where Nahlia is being held. On both sides of Nahlia, you will fond the same kind of pillars you used to open the gate at the start of this quest. Match the faces on the wheels with those on the pillars next to Nahlia to free her, then talk to her. She will tell you that Shada is the leader of the nereids here, and that one of her daughters is polluting the waters nearby. Once you are done talking, Ralai will arrive; speak with her to finish the quest."}

It is a truly uncouth way to victory. The way of the exposed palm is far more sophisticated and far more deadly.\nConsider this question. A man is struck in the chest by the flat of a plate. There is a small bruise but he is otherwise unharmed. Now break the plate and strike him in the chest with a shard using the same force. Now the man is dead or grievously wounded. How can this be? How can a small object harm more than a larger?\nThis essential point is the first finger of the way of the exposed palm. The five part way is concentration, reaction, , speed, breath control. To master unarmed combat all five digits must be mastered.\nThe parable of the man and the plate is concentration. All of the blow is concentrated into a small point. Therefore it is more potent. To strike with just the thumb can be more deadly that to strike with the whole fist. However, only the highly trained fighter can do this.\nThe second aspect of concentration is the mental discipline to think hard about what is being done. Distractions are ignored as the will maintains the ultimate goal. The truly deadly fighter can even block out his own pain in this manner."}

It preached the &lt;a href=\"Thu%27um\"&gt;Thu'um&lt;/a&gt; should only be used for the worship and glory of the gods rather than martial exploits. The philosophy is studied by the &lt;a href=\"Greybeards\"&gt;Greybeards&lt;/a&gt;, who were founded by Jurgen Windcaller.\nBackground.\nBefore the formation of the Way of the Voice, the &lt;a href=\"Nords\"&gt;Nords&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"Skyrim\"&gt;Skyrim&lt;/a&gt; used their Thu'um to their advantage in combat, with the more powerful Thu'um users being known as Tongues. The Voice was used during the conquest of Morrowind, and the war chiefs which led said invasion were all Tongues, not needing siege equipment as they were able to blast open doors with their Voice.\nJurgen Windcaller is said to have been one of the mightiest of all the Tongues. Following the defeat of the Nord army at &lt;a href=\"Red%20Mountain\"&gt;Red Mountain&lt;/a&gt;, Windcaller spent seven years thinking about the meaning of their failure. He believed that the gods had punished the Nords for their misuse of the Voice for anything other than veneration of the gods. As such, he denounced using the Voice for martial exploits.\nThe beliefs of Jurgen Windcaller prevailed, as he proved his strength in a confrontation with seventeen Tongues of the militant school, where Jurgen was said to have swalled their Shouts for three days. After his victory, the Tongues were exhausted and became his disciples, and the Way of the Voice overcame all opposition.\nThis creed is still honored by the &lt;a href=\"Greybeards\"&gt;Greybeards&lt;/a&gt; and their leader, &lt;a href=\"Paarthurnax%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Paarthurnax&lt;/a&gt;, during the &lt;a href=\"Fourth%20Era\"&gt;Fourth Era&lt;/a&gt;. In the aftermath of the &lt;a href=\"Dragon%20Crisis\"&gt;Dragon Crisis&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;a href=\"Fourth%20Era\"&gt;Fourth Era&lt;/a&gt;, Paarthurnax sought to spread the philosophy to the rest of his &lt;a href=\"Dragons%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;dragon-kin&lt;/a&gt;."}

The Kingdom is situated between the &lt;a href=\"Fiefdom%20of%20Menevia\"&gt;Fiefdom of Menevia&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"Gavaudon\"&gt;Fiefdom of Gavaudon&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"Orsinium%20Area\"&gt;Orsinium Area&lt;/a&gt;, and the &lt;a href=\"Wrothgarian%20Mountains\"&gt;Wrothgarian Mountains&lt;/a&gt;.

As time went on, the Kingdom of Wayrest stretched beyond its borders to the &lt;a href=\"Reich%20Gradkeep\"&gt;Fiefdom of Anticlere&lt;/a&gt; to half of the Gavaudon region. The regional deity is the Divine, &lt;a href=\"Akatosh\"&gt;Akatosh&lt;/a&gt; whose religious temple called the &lt;a href=\"Akatosh%20Chantry\"&gt;Akatosh Chantry&lt;/a&gt; is prominent in Wayrest as well as the &lt;a href=\"Order%20of%20the%20Hour\"&gt;Order of the Hour&lt;/a&gt;.

Sometime around &lt;a href=\"1E%20800\"&gt;1E 800&lt;/a&gt;, the denizens of Wayrest were constantly harassed by the &lt;a href=\"Orsimer\"&gt;Orsimer&lt;/a&gt; of the nearby &lt;a href=\"Orsinium\"&gt;Orsinium&lt;/a&gt;, Orcish Raiders consisted of members of &lt;a href=\"Clan%20Bagrakh\"&gt;Clan Bagrakh&lt;/a&gt;. The &lt;a href=\"Bjoulsae%20Raids\"&gt;Bjoulsae Raids&lt;/a&gt; was orchestrated by &lt;a href=\"Clan%20Igron\"&gt;Clan Igron&lt;/a&gt; and was considered the catalyst of the eventual &lt;a href=\"Siege%20of%20Orsinium\"&gt;Siege of Orsinium&lt;/a&gt;. In &lt;a href=\"1E%20948\"&gt;1E 948&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"King%20Joile\"&gt;King Joile&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"Daggerfall\"&gt;Daggerfall&lt;/a&gt; sent an important letter to &lt;a href=\"Gaiden%20Shinji\"&gt;Gaiden Shinji&lt;/a&gt;, leader of the &lt;a href=\"Order%20of%20Diagna\"&gt;Order of Diagna&lt;/a&gt; about the recent raids as well as Orsinium's recent growth. Several years in &lt;a href=\"1E%20980\"&gt;1E 980&lt;/a&gt;, King Joile and Gaiden Shinji advanced into &lt;a href=\"Wrothgar\"&gt;Wrothgar&lt;/a&gt; for the Siege of Orsinium. After the battle, Wayrest began to flourish and become a Kingdom among the Iliac Bay. Many traveling from &lt;a href=\"Bangkorai\"&gt;Bangkorai&lt;/a&gt; and Wrothgar had to travel through the Eastern Bjoulsae and Wayrest making the village a welcome rest, hence the name. Wayrest and the kingdoms of Daggerfall and &lt;a href=\"Sentinel\"&gt;Sentinel&lt;/a&gt; established the &lt;a href=\"Masconian%20Trade%20Way\"&gt;Masconian Trade Way&lt;/a&gt;, a trading system across the Iliac that established strong relations across the sea.\nThe Kingdom of Wayrest; The Gardner Dynasty.\nIn &lt;a href=\"1E%201100\"&gt;1E 1100&lt;/a&gt;, the Kingdom of Wayrest was fully-established under the leadership of the &lt;a href=\"Gardner%20Dynasty\"&gt;Gardner Dynasty&lt;/a&gt;, with their first ruler being &lt;a href=\"Farangel%20Gardner\"&gt;Farangel Gardner&lt;/a&gt;. The Gardners was a wealthy family well established before the Siege of Orsinium. Gardner Castle was built on the High Rock side of the Bjoulsae, and small businesses were created within the walls. Farangel Gardner was officially proclaimed the King of Wayrest when the settlement began to accept ambassadors from the &lt;a href=\"Camoran%20Dynasty\"&gt;Camoran Dynasty&lt;/a&gt;. The Kingdom of Wayrest was created among the Iliac Bay in 1E 1100. Members of the Gardner Family was involved in the Siege of Orsinium and were a part of the Court of Daggerfall under Joile.\n&lt;a href=\"Second%20Era\"&gt;Second Era&lt;/a&gt;.\nDurcorach of the Reach and the Daggerfall Covenant.\nFor quite some time, the Kingdoms of High Rock were peaceful among one another, ever since the &lt;a href=\"Battle%20of%20Granden%20Tor\"&gt;Battle of Granden Tor&lt;/a&gt;. The city of Wayrest was still under the leadership of the Gardner Dynasty, long after Farangel and his ancestors, such as &lt;a href=\"Aphren%20Gardner\"&gt;Aphren Gardner&lt;/a&gt;. King Gardner of Wayrest had ruled Wayrest along with other merchant families such as the &lt;a href=\"House%20Cumberland\"&gt;House Cumberland&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Horley%20Dynasty\"&gt;House Horley&lt;/a&gt;. Around this time in &lt;a href=\"2E%20541\"&gt;2E 541&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Durcorach%20the%20Black%20Drake\"&gt;Durcorach the Black Drake&lt;/a&gt; of the &lt;a href=\"Western%20Reach\"&gt;Western Reach&lt;/a&gt; invaded the Kingdoms of High Rock in the attempt to control the province. The Black Drake's Invasion had assaulted the Bangkorai region and the city of &lt;a href=\"Evermore\"&gt;Evermore&lt;/a&gt;. Moving southwards, they invaded the city of &lt;a href=\"Hallin%27s%20Stand\"&gt;Hallin's Stand&lt;/a&gt; and continued into the Bjoulsae and Stormhaven. The denizens of &lt;a href=\"Alcaire\"&gt;Alcaire&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Menevia\"&gt;Menevia&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Gavaudon\"&gt;Gavaudon&lt;/a&gt; had fled to the city of Wayrest to escape the constant raids along the &lt;a href=\"Wrothgarian%20Mountains\"&gt;Wrothgarian Mountains&lt;/a&gt;. Eventually, the Black Drake had arrived on the outskirts of Wayrest and commenced the &lt;a href=\"Siege%20of%20Wayrest%20%282E%20542%29\"&gt;Siege of Wayrest&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe Siege of Wayrest lasted for fifty-seven days which is approximately two months. The Reachmen lacked any substantial weaponry that was able to besiege the city. They had no &lt;a href=\"siege%20weapons\"&gt;siege weapons&lt;/a&gt; to breach the outer walls on the Menevia front, and they had no warships to create blockade onto Wayrest. The attack was merely a diversion so that the Black Drake can take the cities of &lt;a href=\"Glenumbra\"&gt;Glenumbra&lt;/a&gt;, more specifically, the city of Daggerfall. King Gardner tasked &lt;a href=\"High%20King%20Emeric\"&gt;Emeric of House Cumberland&lt;/a&gt;, to lead a Wayrester Armada to the city of Daggerfall, to aid the denizens of Daggerfall and to defeat the Black Drake. &lt;a href=\"Bergamot%20Deleyn\"&gt;King Bergamot&lt;/a&gt; of Daggerfall led a defensive force consisting of Daggerfall's finest and the &lt;a href=\"Knights%20of%20the%20Dragon\"&gt;Knights of the Dragon&lt;/a&gt;. Emeric advanced into the &lt;a href=\"Daenia\"&gt;Daenia&lt;/a&gt; forest with an army of &lt;a href=\"Heavy%20Dragoons\"&gt;Heavy Dragoons&lt;/a&gt;. The &lt;a href=\"Battle%20of%20Daggerfall\"&gt;Battle of Daggerfall&lt;/a&gt; was fought on two fronts and was eventually resolved when Emeric killed Durcorach with his steel sword. High Rock was quickly overwhelmed by an army of barbarians from the east and needed to come together, to fight against a future threat that may harm the denizens of Bretony. The Kingdoms of Wayrest, Daggerfall, &lt;a href=\"Evermore\"&gt;Evermore&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Camlorn\"&gt;Camlorn&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Shornhelm\"&gt;Shornhelm&lt;/a&gt; banded together to form the first iteration of the &lt;a href=\"Daggerfall%20Covenant\"&gt;Daggerfall Covenant&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe Rise of Emeric; King Ranser's War.\nThe Daggerfall Covenant had potential to be so much more, something that goes beyond &lt;a href=\"Greater%20Bretony\"&gt;Greater Bretony&lt;/a&gt; or even the &lt;a href=\"Iliac%20Bay\"&gt;Iliac Bay&lt;/a&gt; as a whole. This was Emeric's goal when he became the King of Wayrest in &lt;a href=\"2E%20563\"&gt;2E 563&lt;/a&gt; after his bravery against Durcorach the Black Drake and the death of the Gardner Dynasty from the &lt;a href=\"Knahaten%20Flu\"&gt;Knahaten Flu&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"2E%20560\"&gt;2E 560&lt;/a&gt;. Emeric was thinking about a queen, someone to rule alongside him in Wayrest. Initially, Emeric was given the choice of &lt;a href=\"Rayelle\"&gt;Princess Rayelle&lt;/a&gt;, the Princess of &lt;a href=\"Shornhelm\"&gt;Shornhelm&lt;/a&gt; and daughter of &lt;a href=\"King%20Ranser\"&gt;King Ranser Branquette&lt;/a&gt;. Ranser Branquette was notorious among the Kings of High Rock when he fought for the title of King of &lt;a href=\"Rivenspire\"&gt;Rivenspire&lt;/a&gt; from his young brother, &lt;a href=\"Phylgeon\"&gt;Phylgeon Montclair&lt;/a&gt;. Ranser was ruthless and is very stubborn, capable of very atrocious things. Emeric was about to marry Rayelle had he not travel to the city of &lt;a href=\"Sentinel\"&gt;Sentinel&lt;/a&gt; and met &lt;a href=\"Maraya\"&gt;Princess Maraya&lt;/a&gt;, daughter of &lt;a href=\"King%20Fahara%27jad\"&gt;King Fahara'jad&lt;/a&gt;. Emeric married Maraya in the spring of &lt;a href=\"2E%20566\"&gt;2E 566&lt;/a&gt;, and it established the Greater Daggerfall Covenant with the Province of &lt;a href=\"Hammerfell\"&gt;Hammerfell&lt;/a&gt;. Ranser was furious that his daughter was denied by a &lt;a href=\"Redguard\"&gt;Redguard&lt;/a&gt;, he withdrew his ambassador from Wayrest and did not attend the wedding. A storm was brewing in Rivenspire and war was in the air. The year of 2E 566 was the beginning of &lt;a href=\"King%20Ranser%27s%20War\"&gt;King Ranser's Civil War&lt;/a&gt;.\nKing Ranser assembled the three great houses of Rivenspire to attack the city of Wayrest and subsequently the Daggerfall Covenant. The Houses of &lt;a href=\"House%20Dorell\"&gt;Dorell&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"House%20Montclair\"&gt;Montclair&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"House%20Tamrith\"&gt;Tamrith&lt;/a&gt; joined together to fight alongside Ranser and Shornhelm against the Daggerfall Covenant. Baron Phylgeon Montclair tried to become the neutral envoy in the civil war, Emeric's response was unknown while Ranser's angry refusal was well known across the Rivenspire Countryside. The &lt;a href=\"Montclair%20Knight\"&gt;Montclair Knight&lt;/a&gt;s would join Ranser in his assault on Wayrest. Ranser's army moved into the Alcaire fiefdom and entered the Menevia fiefdom to arrive into the Wayrest Outskirts and began the &lt;a href=\"Siege%20of%20Wayrest%20%282E%20566%29\"&gt;Siege of Wayrest&lt;/a&gt;. The Shornhelm Guard was swarming the Wayrest gates while the local militia was holding them back. Emeric and his Cumberland Guard fought the &lt;a href=\"Oldgate%20Lancers\"&gt;Oldgate Lancers&lt;/a&gt; from the fortress of &lt;a href=\"Oldgate\"&gt;Oldgate&lt;/a&gt;, he used a powerful blade called the &lt;a href=\"Orichalc%20Scalpel\"&gt;Orichalc Scalpel&lt;/a&gt;. Emeric and his enchanted broadsword were able to push back the Oldgate Lancers, his troops were behind the wall preparing for Ranser's attack, who came with &lt;a href=\"siege%20weapons\"&gt;siege weapons&lt;/a&gt;.\nRanser was defeated at the &lt;a href=\"Battle%20of%20Markwasten%20Moor\"&gt;Battle of Markwasten Moor&lt;/a&gt; when he was killed by &lt;a href=\"General%20Dathieu\"&gt;General Dathieu&lt;/a&gt; after the constant conflict. Emeric had sent an ambassador named &lt;a href=\"Zephrine%20Frey\"&gt;Zephrine Frey&lt;/a&gt; to &lt;a href=\"King%20Kurog%20gro-Bagrakh\"&gt;King Kurog gro-Bagrakh&lt;/a&gt;, leader of the &lt;a href=\"Orcs\"&gt;Orcs&lt;/a&gt;. Frey had traveled with Kurog for several months and was present with him when he attempted to move to &lt;a href=\"Falkreath%20Hold\"&gt;Falkreath Hold&lt;/a&gt; and to establish the new iteration of &lt;a href=\"Yashnag%27s%20Chiefdom\"&gt;Yashnag's Chiefdom&lt;/a&gt;. Frey told Kurog about Ranser's War and that he needed help to defeat them. Kurog and his militia of Orcs would defeat Ranser's army at Markwasten Moor. After the conflict, Emeric embraced Kurog's &lt;a href=\"Wrothgar\"&gt;Wrothgar&lt;/a&gt; and made them a part of the Daggerfall Covenant. The Covenant had become an incredibly powerful force that rivals the likes of the &lt;a href=\"Reman%20Empire\"&gt;Reman Empire&lt;/a&gt; from the first era and the alliances it would soon fight in a war of three banners.\nTrapped within a dream; Vaermina's Gambit.\nDuring the &lt;a href=\"Interregnum\"&gt;Interregnum&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"2E%20582\"&gt;2E 582&lt;/a&gt;, the city of Wayrest was the capital of the Daggerfall Covenant and leading the helm was High King Emeric of Cumberland and his wife, Queen Maraya of Sentinel. The Stormhaven region has seen a sudden insurgency of &lt;a href=\"Daedra\"&gt;Daedra&lt;/a&gt; occurrences, from as far as the Alcairian fields to the Gavaudanian riverbank. The &lt;a href=\"Supernal%20Dreamers\"&gt;Supernal Dreamers&lt;/a&gt; are a group of worshippers to &lt;a href=\"Vaermina\"&gt;Vaermina&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"Daedric%20Prince\"&gt;Daedric Prince&lt;/a&gt; of Dreams and Nightmares. Various figures present in Stormhaven were possessed by Omens of terror ranging from the &lt;a href=\"Omen%20of%20Blood\"&gt;Omen of Blood&lt;/a&gt; in Menevia to the &lt;a href=\"Omen%20of%20Betrayal\"&gt;Omen of Betrayal&lt;/a&gt; in Gavaudon. Vaermina uses a powerful entity called the &lt;a href=\"Galthis\"&gt;Night Terror&lt;/a&gt; to ensnare Emeric into a never-ending nightmare, causing him to undertake severe decision that may result to the end of the Daggerfall Covenant. The &lt;a href=\"Vestige\"&gt;Vestige&lt;/a&gt;, an agent of Emeric and the Covenant, traveled into Emeric's dream and defeated the Night Terror. The battle opened a gateway to &lt;a href=\"Quagmire\"&gt;Quagmire&lt;/a&gt;, the Daedric Plane of Oblivion to Vaermina. It was there that the Vestige met Vaermina, deep within the clouds of Quagmire, Vaermina withdrew from Stormhaven and Emeric was saved from her influence. Emeric continued to rule the Daggerfall Covenant and Wayrest.\nThe Cumberland's Wayrest and Onwards.\nHigh King Emeric would bring upon a new dynasty of Kings into Wayrest called the &lt;a href=\"Cumberland%20Dynasty\"&gt;Cumberland Dynasty&lt;/a&gt;. This dynasty would last for several years into the Interregnum and would leave a mark on the history of the Western World, the central square of Wayrest would be named &lt;a href=\"Cumberland%20Square\"&gt;Cumberland Square&lt;/a&gt;, in honor of Emeric and his descendants. The Cumberlands would eventually fall, and a new dynasty takes its place in the Kingdom of Wayrest, not much is known about the &lt;a href=\"Horley%20Dynasty\"&gt;Horley Dynasty&lt;/a&gt;, but they left a significant mark on the province to be mentioned in history. Like the Gardners and the Cumberlands before, non of the Horley leaders would be assassinated by rival politicians. The Horleys would eventually be dissolved of their power, and the &lt;a href=\"Septim%20Empire\"&gt;Septim Empire&lt;/a&gt; would step in and take control of Wayrest. This occurred when the province of High Rock was integrated into the &lt;a href=\"Septim%20Empire\"&gt;Septim Empire&lt;/a&gt; when &lt;a href=\"Tiber%20Septim\"&gt;Tiber Septim&lt;/a&gt; became Emperor of Tamriel and united the provinces in &lt;a href=\"2E%20896\"&gt;2E 896&lt;/a&gt;.\n&lt;a href=\"Third%20Era\"&gt;Third Era&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe Septim Chronicles of Wayrest.\nIn &lt;a href=\"3E%20119\"&gt;3E 119&lt;/a&gt;, the Septim Empire had control over Wayrest, and many Septim leaders would come from Wayrest and other cities like &lt;a href=\"Solitude\"&gt;Solitude&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"Ebonheart\"&gt;Ebonheart&lt;/a&gt;. One of these leaders was &lt;a href=\"Thoriz%20Pelagius%20Septim\"&gt;Thoriz Pelagius Septim&lt;/a&gt;, more commonly known as Pelagius III or Pelagius the Mad. Pelagius was the son of &lt;a href=\"Magnus%20Septim\"&gt;Magnus Septim&lt;/a&gt;, the King of &lt;a href=\"Lilmoth\"&gt;Lilmoth&lt;/a&gt; and the Emperor of Tamriel after &lt;a href=\"Cephorus%20Septim\"&gt;Cephorus Septim&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Kintyra%20Septim\"&gt;Kintyra Septim&lt;/a&gt;. Magnus and Pelagius were present at the &lt;a href=\"Siege%20of%20Solitude\"&gt;Siege of Solitude&lt;/a&gt;, the final conflict in the &lt;a href=\"War%20of%20the%20Red%20Diamond\"&gt;War of the Red Diamond&lt;/a&gt;. Pelagius was given a strange amulet from an &lt;a href=\"Potema%20Septim\"&gt;elderly woman&lt;/a&gt; that wield a &lt;a href=\"soul%20gem\"&gt;soul gem&lt;/a&gt; with the spirit of a deranged &lt;a href=\"werewolf\"&gt;werewolf&lt;/a&gt; demon. This amulet had a serious effect on Pelagius and made his mind slowly wonder, into the world of madness. Pelagius was the son of Magnus and &lt;a href=\"Utheilla%20Direnni\"&gt;Utheilla Direnni&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"Balfiera\"&gt;Balfiera&lt;/a&gt;. Pelagius III would eventually become the King of Solitude after Potema Septim and the Emperor of Tamriel. He would marry &lt;a href=\"Katariah%20Ra%27athim\"&gt;Katariah Ra'athim&lt;/a&gt; of Ebonheart resulting in Katariah ruling over the Empire since Pelagius would be too insane to rule. He was taken to an asylum in &lt;a href=\"Torval\"&gt;Torval&lt;/a&gt; and later the &lt;a href=\"Temple%20of%20Kynareth\"&gt;Temple of Kynareth&lt;/a&gt; on the Isle of &lt;a href=\"Betony\"&gt;Betony&lt;/a&gt;. He would then pass away on the 34th of &lt;a href=\"Last%20Seed\"&gt;Last Seed&lt;/a&gt; in his cell on Betony.\nWhen Katariah Septim ruled over the Empire, &lt;a href=\"Cassynder%20Septim\"&gt;Cassynder Septim&lt;/a&gt;, Katariah's child was the leader of Wayrest. Cassynder had controlled Wayrest for years but was forced to retire because of poor health; he would soon retire from the throne and pass it to his half-brother, &lt;a href=\"Uriel%20Septim%20IV\"&gt;Uriel Septim IV&lt;/a&gt;. After Katariah died in &lt;a href=\"Black%20Marsh\"&gt;Black Marsh&lt;/a&gt;, Cassynder had to assume the throne and become the Emperor of Tamriel. Cassynder would later die from illness, being the last descendant of Tiber Septim. Uriel IV was not related to Tiber Septim nor Cassynder; he has conceived after Pelagius III's death on Betony, his father was &lt;a href=\"Gallivere%20Lariat\"&gt;Gallivere Lariat&lt;/a&gt;, Katariah's &lt;a href=\"Breton\"&gt;Breton&lt;/a&gt; consort from the city of &lt;a href=\"Shornhelm\"&gt;Shornhelm&lt;/a&gt;. Uriel ruled after Cassynder and did so for several years. He would face a constant clash with the &lt;a href=\"Elder%20Council\"&gt;Elder Council&lt;/a&gt; over certain decisions since he was not a direct descendant, he was not given full rights. He would be succeeded by &lt;a href=\"Cephorus%20Septim%20II\"&gt;Cephorus Septim II&lt;/a&gt;.\nWayrest during the Imperial Simulacrum.\nDuring the &lt;a href=\"Imperial%20Simulacrum\"&gt;Imperial Simulacrum&lt;/a&gt; from &lt;a href=\"3E%20389\"&gt;3E 389&lt;/a&gt; to &lt;a href=\"3E%20399\"&gt;3E 399&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Emperor\"&gt;Emperor&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Uriel%20Septim%20VII\"&gt;Uriel Septim VII&lt;/a&gt; was imprisoned along with &lt;a href=\"Talin%20Warhaft\"&gt;Talin Warhaft&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;a href=\"Deadlands\"&gt;Deadlands&lt;/a&gt; by &lt;a href=\"Jagar%20Tharn\"&gt;Jagar Tharn&lt;/a&gt;. Tharn planned for months to capture the throne, and he was able to achieve so in the span of ten years. Tharn had a powerful weapon called the &lt;a href=\"Staff%20of%20Chaos\"&gt;Staff of Chaos&lt;/a&gt;, and he split it into nine pieces and scattered them across Tamriel, the staff was the only thing keeping Uriel Septim and Warhaft in &lt;a href=\"Oblivion%20%28Realm%29\"&gt;Oblivion&lt;/a&gt;. A warrior escaped his clutches and traveled all corners of Tamriel to retrieve the missing pieces. The hero was known as the &lt;a href=\"Eternal%20Champion\"&gt;Eternal Champion&lt;/a&gt;, and he assembled the staff and defeated Jagar Tharn at the &lt;a href=\"Imperial%20Palace\"&gt;Imperial Palace&lt;/a&gt;. The Eternal Champion had at one point visited the city of Wayrest in their quest to recover the pieces. The city of Wayrest was under the rule of &lt;a href=\"King%20Tristore\"&gt;King Tristore&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe Birth of the Third Orsinium; Gortwog gro-Nagorm.\nIn &lt;a href=\"3E%20399\"&gt;3E 399&lt;/a&gt; in the waning years of the Simulacrum, an area nestled within the &lt;a href=\"Wrothgarian%20Mountains\"&gt;Wrothgarian Mountains&lt;/a&gt; were claimed by &lt;a href=\"Lord%20Bowyn\"&gt;Lord Bowyn&lt;/a&gt; of Wayrest and was sought out by &lt;a href=\"Clan%20Minat\"&gt;Clan Minat&lt;/a&gt;, an &lt;a href=\"Orc\"&gt;Orc&lt;/a&gt;ish clan of &lt;a href=\"Wrothgar\"&gt;Wrothgar&lt;/a&gt;. Bowyn was challenged by &lt;a href=\"Gortwog%20gro-Nagorm\"&gt;Gortwog gro-Nagorm&lt;/a&gt; for the rights of the pocket realm in the mountains. Both Bowyn and Nagorm had equal rights on the land and the papers to back it up, the only way to settle this in civilized Wayrest is through a duel. The duel had Gortwog choose the equipment while it had Bowyn choose the location. The duel was to take place at &lt;a href=\"Lord%20Berylth\"&gt;Lord Berylth&lt;/a&gt;'s Palace in Wayrest, and they were to use &lt;a href=\"Orcish%20Armor\"&gt;Orcish Armor&lt;/a&gt; created by the finest smiths in Wayrest. Bowyn initially was unable to move around in orcish armor; he was trained by an Orcish servant of Berylith named &lt;a href=\"Old%20Tunner\"&gt;Old Tunner&lt;/a&gt;, who was once a part of the &lt;a href=\"Cursed%20Legion\"&gt;Cursed Legion&lt;/a&gt; of High Rock. Eventually, Bowyn mastered the armor but ultimately lost to Gortwog. The land was named &lt;a href=\"Orsinium%20Area\"&gt;Orsinium&lt;/a&gt; in honor of the Orcs that came before, to bring upon the dream of Orsinium again.\nThe Royal Family of Wayrest; The Miracle of Peace.\nDuring the &lt;a href=\"Warp%20in%20the%20West\"&gt;Warp in the West&lt;/a&gt;, the city of Wayrest was under the rule of &lt;a href=\"King%20Eadwyre\"&gt;King Eadwyre&lt;/a&gt;, the old yet hearty leader of Wayrest who has been friends with several people within the Empire, notably &lt;a href=\"Uriel%20VI\"&gt;Uriel VI&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Symmachus\"&gt;Symmachus&lt;/a&gt;. Eadwyre had recently lost his wife, &lt;a href=\"Queen%20Carolyna\"&gt;Queen Carolyna&lt;/a&gt;, who passed away from age. He also had a child with her named &lt;a href=\"Elysana\"&gt;Elysana&lt;/a&gt;. Sometime around the &lt;a href=\"War%20of%20Betony\"&gt;War of Betony&lt;/a&gt;, Eadwyre married &lt;a href=\"Barenziah\"&gt;Barenziah&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"Mournhold\"&gt;Mournhold&lt;/a&gt; after conspiring with her against &lt;a href=\"Jagar%20Tharn\"&gt;Jagar Tharn&lt;/a&gt;. He had a stepchild named &lt;a href=\"Helseth%20Hlaalu\"&gt;Helseth Hlaalu&lt;/a&gt;, who was destined to inherit the throne of Mournhold in the &lt;a href=\"Deshaan%20Plains\"&gt;Deshaan Plains&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Morgiah\"&gt;Morgiah&lt;/a&gt;, destined to become the Queen of &lt;a href=\"Firsthold\"&gt;Firsthold&lt;/a&gt; on the Isle of &lt;a href=\"Auridon\"&gt;Auridon&lt;/a&gt;. Both Elysana and Helseth would constantly fight for the throne of Wayrest should Eadwyre through circumstances.\nThe Rise of King Lysandus; Woodborne's Demise.\nKing Lysandus was killed during the Battle of Cryngaine Field; rumor has it that King Camaron shot the man while others believed that Gortwog gro-Nagorm assassinated him amidst the fog. Before the Warp in the West, &lt;a href=\"Uriel%20Septim%20VII\"&gt;Uriel Septim VII&lt;/a&gt; sent &lt;a href=\"The%20Agent\"&gt;an agent&lt;/a&gt; to respond to the sudden appearance of Lysandus' spirit. The Agent had met with &lt;a href=\"Medora%20Direnni\"&gt;Medora Direnni&lt;/a&gt;, Lysandus' personal sorceress, who was imprisoned in &lt;a href=\"Direnni%20Tower\"&gt;Direnni Tower&lt;/a&gt; by &lt;a href=\"Mynisera\"&gt;Mynisera&lt;/a&gt;, the Dowager Queen of Daggerfall. Medora tasks the champion to travel to &lt;a href=\"Lysandus%27%20Tomb\"&gt;Lysandus' Tomb&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;a href=\"Fiefdom%20of%20Menevia\"&gt;Fiefdom of Menevia&lt;/a&gt; and to uncover the real assassin of her former lover. Lysandus' Spirit spoke to the champion and revealed that &lt;a href=\"Lord%20Woodborne\"&gt;Lord Woodborne&lt;/a&gt; had assassinated him. Woodborne was Princess Elysana's lover and would inherit the throne of Wayrest if Helseth Hlaalu was dealt with in some way. He sought the aid of King Lysandus, but he refused the offer. Woodborne used Nagorm's Orsimer to assassinate the King and to send him to &lt;a href=\"Tamarilyn%20Point\"&gt;Tamarilyn Point&lt;/a&gt;, where he would be buried. The Spirit of Lysandus sent the agent to the city of Wayrest, to even the odds with Woodborne. The Agent arrived at &lt;a href=\"Woodborne%20Hall\"&gt;Woodborne Hall&lt;/a&gt; and confronted the noble. Woodborne and the agent fought valiantly until he was defeated. It was at that moment, Lysandus had been avenged, and his spirit returned into &lt;a href=\"Aetherius\"&gt;Aetherius&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe Warp in the West; the Kingdom of Wayrest.\nEadwyre was one of the seven people to miraculously come to the possession of the &lt;a href=\"Totem%20of%20Tiber%20Septim\"&gt;Totem of Tiber Septim&lt;/a&gt; after the &lt;a href=\"Blades\"&gt;Blades&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"Castle%20Llugwych\"&gt;Castle Llugwych&lt;/a&gt; took the totem from &lt;a href=\"Castle%20Daggerfall\"&gt;Castle Daggerfall&lt;/a&gt;. The event known as the Warp in the West occurred when the Agent traveled to the &lt;a href=\"Mantellan%20Crux\"&gt;Mantellan Crux&lt;/a&gt; in the planes of Aetherius to retrieve the &lt;a href=\"Mantella\"&gt;Mantella&lt;/a&gt; and to jumpstart the &lt;a href=\"Numidium\"&gt;Numidium&lt;/a&gt;. After the event, the Agent was sent into a timeline, causing their death in all timelines. The Warp produced the several timelines to combine into a single outcome. Eadwyre used his newfound power to make the Kingdom of Wayrest, the one region to rule all of the Iliac. The actual result had the Kingdom of Wayrest stretch across the central coast of the Iliac Bay, from the Eastern &lt;a href=\"Fiefdom%20of%20Anticlere\"&gt;Fiefdom of Anticlere&lt;/a&gt; to the &lt;a href=\"Gavaudon\"&gt;Fiefdom of Gavaudon&lt;/a&gt;. The Kingdom of Daggerfall stretched from the northern coast to Western Anticlere and the &lt;a href=\"Fiefdom%20of%20Ykalon\"&gt;Fiefdom of Ykalon&lt;/a&gt;. The Iliac Bay went from twenty-three different regions to merely four regions of Daggerfall, Sentinel, Orsinium, and Wayrest.\nThe Warp Aftermath; The reign of Elysana.\nAfter the Warp in the West, the Kingdom of Wayrest flourished and was at peace with the other nations in the Iliac Bay. Barenziah, Helseth, and Morgiah moved on from Wayrest and traveled beyond the province. Barenziah and Helseth returned to the city of Mournhold in &lt;a href=\"Morrowind\"&gt;Morrowind&lt;/a&gt;, where Helseth became the King of Morrowind, after the death of &lt;a href=\"King%20Athyn%20Llethan\"&gt;King Athyn Llethan&lt;/a&gt;. Morgiah moved to the city of Firsthold and married King &lt;a href=\"Reman%20Karoodil\"&gt;Reman Karoodil&lt;/a&gt;. Elysana inherited the throne from Eadwyre, as the first-born child of Eadwyre. During her reign, Elysana was feared across the land and had to outmaneuver Helseth, who had a reputation for being cunning in his pursuits. Elysana allied with Gortwog gro-Nagorm and the attempt to control the region. She would continue to rule over Wayrest, into the &lt;a href=\"Oblivion%20Crisis\"&gt;Oblivion Crisis&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Fourth%20Era\"&gt;Fourth Era&lt;/a&gt;.\n&lt;a href=\"Fourth%20Era\"&gt;Fourth Era&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe Corsair Invasion of Wayrest; Barynia's Treason.\nSometime after the &lt;a href=\"Great%20War\"&gt;Great War&lt;/a&gt;, the Kingdom of Wayrest was ruled by &lt;a href=\"King%20Barynia\"&gt;King Barynia&lt;/a&gt;, his relation to Elysana is unknown, but is likely not to be related. Barynia had a shaky reign in Wayrest, he was very anxious, and many politicians in the region wanted a change in the Kingdom. The Temple of the Divines was re-purposed as a &lt;a href=\"Temple%20of%20Akatosh\"&gt;Temple of Akatosh&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Order%20of%20the%20Hour\"&gt;Order of the Hour&lt;/a&gt; occupied the temple. In response to all of the backlash to him, Barynia opened the ports of Wayrest to anyone coming from the Iliac Bay, this brought in &lt;a href=\"Corsair\"&gt;Corsair&lt;/a&gt;s into the city and caused the &lt;a href=\"Invasion%20of%20Wayrest\"&gt;Invasion of Wayrest&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"4E%20188\"&gt;4E 188&lt;/a&gt;. Barynia hired the Corsairs to attack Wayrest, to kill the opposition. He planned to escape Wayrest via ship but was encountered by the &lt;a href=\"Dark%20Brotherhood\"&gt;Dark Brotherhood&lt;/a&gt;. His fate was unknown, he either escaped with the promise of land or was assassinated on the spot. The &lt;a href=\"Wayrest%20Sanctuary\"&gt;Wayrest Sanctuary&lt;/a&gt; was discovered by the Corsairs, they raided the sanctuary and destroyed the Brotherhood chapter in Wayrest. The only ones remaining were the &lt;a href=\"Cheydinhal\"&gt;Cheydinhal&lt;/a&gt; chapter and the &lt;a href=\"Falkreath\"&gt;Falkreath&lt;/a&gt; chapter."}

She is prized above all cities in &lt;a href=\"High%20Rock\"&gt;High Rock&lt;/a&gt; -- no other city has contributed, and continues to contribute so much to the culture of the &lt;a href=\"Bretons\"&gt;Bretons&lt;/a&gt;. The spirits of her genius children continue to haunt the streets; you can see them in the gabled roofs, grand boulevards, aromatic marketplaces. The people of Wayrest have an instictive appreciation of their past, but are not obsessed by it, as the people of &lt;a href=\"Daggerfall\"&gt;Daggerfall&lt;/a&gt; seem to be. One feels that one is in a modern city when one visits Wayrest, but there is a magic in the air that could only come from thirty-two centuries of civilization.\nIt is difficult for historians to declare a certain date for the foundation of Wayrest. A settlement of some variety had been existence where the &lt;a href=\"Bjoulsae%20River\"&gt;Bjoulsae River&lt;/a&gt; feeds the &lt;a href=\"Iliac%20Bay\"&gt;Iliac Bay&lt;/a&gt; possibly since the &lt;a href=\"1E%20800\"&gt;800th year&lt;/a&gt; of the &lt;a href=\"First%20Era\"&gt;First Era&lt;/a&gt;. The traders and fishermen of Wayrest were surrounded by hostile parties: the orc capitol &lt;a href=\"Orsinium\"&gt;Orsinium&lt;/a&gt; had grown like a &lt;a href=\"poison\"&gt;poison&lt;/a&gt; weed to the north, and the &lt;a href=\"Akaviri\"&gt;Akaviri&lt;/a&gt; pirates and raiders crowded the islands to the west. There is no mystery to Wayrest's name. After the fighting most travellers had to endure passing through the eastern end of the Iliac Bay, the little fishing village on the Bjoulsae was a welcome rest.\nNowhere in the much vaunted censuses of the &lt;a href=\"Skyrim\"&gt;Skyrim&lt;/a&gt; Occupation is Wayrest mentioned. In the Annals of Daggerfall, King &lt;a href=\"Joile\"&gt;Joile&lt;/a&gt;'s letter to &lt;a href=\"Gaiden%20Shinji\"&gt;Gaiden Shinji&lt;/a&gt; of the &lt;a href=\"Order%20of%20Diagna\"&gt;Order of Diagna&lt;/a&gt; contains the following reference: \"The orcs have been much plaguing the Wayresters and impeding traffic to the heart of the land.\" The date given for the letter was &lt;a href=\"1E%20948\"&gt;1E 948&lt;/a&gt;.\nWayrest only truly bloomed after the &lt;a href=\"Siege%20of%20Orsinium\"&gt;razing of Orsinium&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"1E%20980\"&gt;1E 980&lt;/a&gt;. The hard-working traders and &lt;a href=\"merchants\"&gt;merchants&lt;/a&gt; were instrumental in forming the &lt;a href=\"Masconian%20Trade%20Way\"&gt;Masconian Trade Way&lt;/a&gt; and thus reducing the pirate activity on the Bay. At this time, Wayrest occupied both banks of the Bjoulsae. A successful mercantile family, the &lt;a href=\"Gardner%20Dynasty\"&gt;Gardners&lt;/a&gt;, built a walled palace on the High Rock side of the river and, over time, allowed banks and other businesses within its walls. It was a Gardner, &lt;a href=\"Farangel%20Gardner\"&gt;Farangel&lt;/a&gt;, who was proclaimed king when Wayrest accepted ambassadors from the &lt;a href=\"Camaron\"&gt;Camorian&lt;/a&gt; Empire, and was granted the right to call itself a kingdom in the &lt;a href=\"1E%201100\"&gt;1100th&lt;/a&gt; year of the &lt;a href=\"1st%20Era\"&gt;1st Era&lt;/a&gt;.\nAlthough Wayrest became a kingdom under the command of one family, the merchants continued to wield incredible power. Many economists have alleged that Wayrest's eternal wealth, despite all her hardships, comes from this rare relationship between the merchants and the crown. The &lt;a href=\"Gardner%20Dynasty\"&gt;Gardner Dynasty&lt;/a&gt; fell, followed by the &lt;a href=\"Cumberland%20Dynasty\"&gt;Cumberland Dynasty&lt;/a&gt;, which was followed by the &lt;a href=\"Horley%20Dynasty\"&gt;Horley Dynasty&lt;/a&gt;, and finally, in the &lt;a href=\"Third%20Era\"&gt;Third Era&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"Septim%20Dynasty\"&gt;Septim Dynasty&lt;/a&gt;. No citizen of another kingdom of comparable age can, with one hand, name all the families who have ever ruled. Never has a king of Wayrest been deposed by revolution or assassination. Except for those of the Septim family, every king of Wayrest can trace his line back to a merchant prince of Wayrest. The merchants and king respect one another, and this relationship strengthens both.\nOne need only walk down the great boulevard of Wayrest to see physical proof of this unique alliance. Going north to south, Wayrest Boulevard suddenly divides, one half going west and the other going east. Both halfs end in identical squares: one at &lt;a href=\"Castle%20Wayrest\"&gt;Castle Wayrest&lt;/a&gt;, the original palace of &lt;a href=\"Aphren%20Gardner\"&gt;Aphren Gardner&lt;/a&gt;, and the other at &lt;a href=\"Cumberland%20Square\"&gt;Cumberland Square&lt;/a&gt;, where the oldest and wealthiest marketplace in Wayrest. The message here is clear: the king and the merchants are joined and equal.\nWayrest has survived blights, droughts, plagues, piracy, invasions, and war with good humor and practicality. In &lt;a href=\"1E%202702\"&gt;1E 2702&lt;/a&gt;, the entire population of the city was forced to move into the walled estate of the Gardners as protection against the pirates, Akaviri raiders, and &lt;a href=\"Thrassian%20plague\"&gt;Thrassian plague&lt;/a&gt;. A less resourceful community would have withered, but the Wayresters have survived to enrich Tamriel generation after generation."}

It is at the edge of the &lt;a href=\"Iliac%20Bay\"&gt;Iliac Bay&lt;/a&gt; on the mouth of the great &lt;a href=\"Bjoulsae%20River\"&gt;Bjoulsae River&lt;/a&gt;, while &lt;a href=\"Daggerfall%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Daggerfall&lt;/a&gt; is at the opposite side of the bay. Wayrest is a major trading city, and serves as the base of the &lt;a href=\"Fighters%20Guild%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Fighters Guild&lt;/a&gt;.\nHistory.\nWayrest has existed as a major city for many hundreds of years, and was prosperous for even longer. The city has long been seen as a rival to &lt;a href=\"Daggerfall%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Daggerfall&lt;/a&gt;, which was already well-established ever since Wayrest had been founded as a small fishing village.\nThe city entered a golden age after the Fall of Orsinium in &lt;a href=\"1E%20980\"&gt;1E 980&lt;/a&gt;, when much trade and commerce was brought to the city, giving it a great deal of wealth and power. The city today boasts one of the wealthiest and highest populations in High Rock.\nIn 2E 541, &lt;a href=\"Durcorach%20the%20Black%20Drake\"&gt;Durcorach the Black Drake&lt;/a&gt;, the progenitor of the &lt;a href=\"Longhouse%20Emperors\"&gt;Longhouse Emperors&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"Cyrodiil%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Cyrodiil&lt;/a&gt;, crossed the &lt;a href=\"Bjoulsae%20River\"&gt;Bjoulsae River&lt;/a&gt; and began a fifty-seven day siege of Wayrest. After the Reachmen were eventually driven back and defeated by &lt;a href=\"High%20King%20Emeric%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Emeric of Cumberland&lt;/a&gt; at the gates of Daggerfall, Wayrest, along with Daggerfall, &lt;a href=\"Shornhelm%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Shornhelm&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Camlorn%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Camlorn&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Evermore%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Evermore&lt;/a&gt;, signed the first Daggerfall Covenant, an agreement between the kingdoms that if any invaders were to threaten High Rock, all the kingdoms would defend the province.\nEmeric ascended to the throne of Wayrest in 2E 563, as a result of the death of King &lt;a href=\"Gardner%20Dynasty\"&gt;Gardner&lt;/a&gt; due to the &lt;a href=\"Knahaten%20Flu\"&gt;Knahaten Flu&lt;/a&gt;, leaving no heirs.\nRanser's War.\nIn 2E 566, Emeric began a search for his bride. Most citizens expected Emeric to marry &lt;a href=\"Rayelle\"&gt;Rayelle&lt;/a&gt;, daughter of King &lt;a href=\"King%20Ranser\"&gt;Ranser&lt;/a&gt; of Shornhelm, but instead Emeric married &lt;a href=\"Maraya\"&gt;Maraya&lt;/a&gt;, daughter of &lt;a href=\"Fahara%27jad\"&gt;King Fahara'jad&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"Sentinel%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Sentinel&lt;/a&gt;. This surprised many citizens and nobles across the land. However, Emeric marrying Maraya was a method to strengthen trade and diplomacy between High Rock and &lt;a href=\"Hammerfell%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Hammerfell&lt;/a&gt;.\nThis outraged King Ranser, who hired an army of mercenaries to sack Wayrest in Last Seed of 2E 566, thus beginning &lt;a href=\"King%20Ranser%27s%20War\"&gt;King Ranser's War&lt;/a&gt;. They swept down from the northern mountains, taking Emeric by surprise. Ranser's army was very nearly successful, but was driven back by the efforts of the King's personal Guard. Ranser was unaware that his forces were insufficient to take the city, and so as the siege went on, the tide of war turned against him as reinforcements arrived at Wayrest to protect the city, from both Hammerfell and the other kingdoms of High Rock. Ranser's aggression was unpopular in Rivenspire, and many prominent houses withdrew their military support and demanded peace.\nEventually, the number of defenders far exceeded Ranser's relatively small band of mercenaries. He retreated back to Shornhelm, which he found as a smoldering ruin. This was the work of the &lt;a href=\"Orsimer%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Orcs&lt;/a&gt; led by &lt;a href=\"Kurog%20gro-Orsinium\"&gt;Kurog gro-Orsinium&lt;/a&gt;, who had long been enemies of the kingdom. With nowhere to retreat to, and the advancing &lt;a href=\"Redguards%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Redguard&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Bretons%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Breton&lt;/a&gt; forces rapidly approaching, Ranser's army was utterly destroyed in the &lt;a href=\"Battle%20of%20Markwasten%20Moor\"&gt;Battle of Markwasten Moor&lt;/a&gt;. He managed to escape to a tor with a few of his other men overlooking his burning city. In desperation, Ranser turned to a &lt;a href=\"necromantic\"&gt;necromantic&lt;/a&gt; ritual before being killed by one of his own generals. The area is now known as &lt;a href=\"Traitor%27s%20Tor%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Traitor's Tor&lt;/a&gt;.\nEmeric, after seeing the results of Ranser's War, proposed the &lt;a href=\"Daggerfall%20Covenant\"&gt;Second Daggerfall Covenant&lt;/a&gt;. He had already formed a diplomatic alliance with Hammerfell, and now he made a war treaty with the Orcs for their help in Ranser's War. He strengthened ties with Hammerfell and Orsinium, and the three leaders all agreed to sign the Second Daggerfall Covenant, a strong alliance formed to end the poverty and suffering throughout &lt;a href=\"Tamriel\"&gt;Tamriel&lt;/a&gt;.\nGeography.\nWayrest is split into seven districts. The northeastern part of the city between the north and east gate lies the Residential district, where most of the city's homes are located. Also by the north gate is the &lt;a href=\"Cloudy%20Dregs%20Inn\"&gt;Cloudy Dregs Inn&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"Foal%27s%20Rest%20Stables\"&gt;Foal's Rest&lt;/a&gt; stables and a general goods stall. Directly west of the Wayrest Treasury, and south of Residential District, lies the Merchant District, where many traders do business in Wayrest's bustling Market Square as well as the shops surrounding it. The &lt;a href=\"Fighters%20Guild%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Fighters Guild's&lt;/a&gt; Headquarters are also located in the Merchant District. East of the Merchant District is the Banking District, which is marked by the &lt;a href=\"Wayrest%20Treasury\"&gt;Wayrest Treasury&lt;/a&gt;. The group dungeon &lt;a href=\"Wayrest%20Sewers\"&gt;Wayrest Sewers&lt;/a&gt; is located between these two districts.\nThe west-southwest portion of Wayrest contains the Palace District and the Temple District, which are dominated by, as their names both suggest, the &lt;a href=\"Castle%20Wayrest%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Palace of Wayrest&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Temple%20of%20the%20Divines%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Temple of the Divines&lt;/a&gt;, respectively. Just beyond the south gate is the Mages District, which holds the &lt;a href=\"Mages%20Guild%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Mages Guild&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Chironasium\"&gt;Chironasium&lt;/a&gt;, an alchemy and enchanting shop.\nFinally, the shantytown of &lt;a href=\"Dreughside\"&gt;Dreughside&lt;/a&gt; lies just outside the city walls, and contains many homes, but it has been overrun by &lt;a href=\"Dreugh%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Dreugh&lt;/a&gt;.\nTravel.\nAt the &lt;a href=\"Wayrest%20Docks\"&gt;Wayrest Docks&lt;/a&gt;, it is possible to arrange passage to &lt;a href=\"Sentinel%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Sentinel&lt;/a&gt; in Hammerfell. Wayrest also has a &lt;a href=\"Wayrest%20Wayshrine\"&gt;wayshrine&lt;/a&gt; in the Palace District, just south of the palace, making it easy to get into the Merchant, Banking and Mages Districts.\nGetting there.\nWayrest is relatively easy to access. It is located in the middle of &lt;a href=\"Stormhaven%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Stormhaven&lt;/a&gt;, which shares a land border with &lt;a href=\"Rivenspire\"&gt;Rivenspire&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Bangkorai\"&gt;Bangkorai&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Glenumbra%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Glenumbra&lt;/a&gt;, and travel by boat to Wayrest can be paid for at the &lt;a href=\"Sentinel%20Docks\"&gt;Sentinel Docks&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;a href=\"Alik%27r%20Desert%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Alik'r Desert&lt;/a&gt;. Almost every road in Stormhaven leads into the city, making it so anyone can access the city easily."}

Once a Wayshrine of a Divine has been activated at least once, the Hero can receive that Divine's blessing at any &lt;a href=\"chapel\"&gt;chapel&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Cyrodiil\"&gt;Cyrodiil&lt;/a&gt; (by visiting the mini-altar under the Divine's image in the temple).\nThe &lt;a href=\"fame\"&gt;fame&lt;/a&gt; required to activate a Wayshrine is dependent on the last time the Hero used one for that Divine; if their fame is greater than what it was the last time they activated one of the Divine's Wayshrines, they will receive the blessing. The Fame counter is separate for each Divine, so after the Hero activates the Wayshrine for one Divine, they can still use the shrines for other Divines without having to raise their fame, though they will still have to raise it to use another Wayshrine for that Divine. The minimum required fame to activate a Wayshrine is one.\nEach Divine has at least two and five at the most wayshrines scattered throughout Cyrodiil, that's a total of twenty-five wayshrines. Once the Hero has visited at least one shrine for each Divine, they will receive the Greater Power &lt;a href=\"Pilgrim%27s%20Grace\"&gt;Pilgrim's Grace&lt;/a&gt;, which &lt;a href=\"Fortify%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;fortifies&lt;/a&gt; all attributes by 10 for 300 seconds when cast. Completing a pilgrimage to a wayshrine of each Divine will also reset infamy to zero.\nWayshrine Circuit.\nActivating one of the wayshrines of each of the &lt;a href=\"Nine%20Divines\"&gt;Nine Divines&lt;/a&gt; in any order grants the &lt;a href=\"Pilgrim%27s%20Grace\"&gt;Pilgrim's Grace&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Greater%20Power\"&gt;Greater Power&lt;/a&gt; if the Hero's infamy is zero when the circuit is completed. Otherwise, if is installed, completing the circuit resets the Hero's infamy to zero. To gain Pilgrim's Grace, the circuit must then be done a second time while gaining no infamy in the process. The infamy reset effect can be achieved repeatedly after more infamy is gained, resetting it to zero each time.\n&lt;a href=\"Pilgrimage%20%28Knights%20of%20the%20Nine%29\"&gt;Pilgrimage&lt;/a&gt; quest.\nDuring the Pilgrimage quest from the &lt;a href=\"Official%20Plug-ins%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;plug-in&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"The%20Prophet%20%28Knights%20of%20the%20Nine%29\"&gt;the Prophet's&lt;/a&gt; map indicates one location for each shrine; the Hero does not have to visit that specific location to complete the quest, any of the wayshrines for each god is acceptable. The map is not an accurate representation for the locations of the shrines, but is more of a guide to help the Hero find them."}

Many of these sites were chosen due to specific miracles or blessed events that marked them, though others simply inspire feelings of reverence for matters divine. Because they are located here and there where inspiration struck, rather than at points of convenience, these sites are scattered across the land, and have come to be known as \"&lt;a href=\"Wayshrines%20%28Online%29\"&gt;wayshrines&lt;/a&gt;.\"\nOf course, the shrines built at these sites by devout worshipers reflect the local religious beliefs, and are constructed and adorned so as to honor the foremost local Divines. Many priesthoods believe that wayshrines act as direct conduits to &lt;a href=\"Aetherius\"&gt;Aetherius&lt;/a&gt;, and that when a mortal dies his or her soul is drawn to the nearest wayshrine, where it meets some sort of psychopomp or spiritual escort, who leads the soul to the afterlife. Though this is a mystical matter and therefore not susceptible to scholarly proof, it is striking that so many different faiths across Tamriel endorse this belief.\nAs all know, the stars in the heavens are perforations in the &lt;a href=\"Mundus\"&gt;Mundus&lt;/a&gt; through which shines the magical light of Aetherius. Lord &lt;a href=\"Corvus%20Direnni\"&gt;Corvus Direnni&lt;/a&gt; theorized that the locations of wayshrines on Tamriel correspond to the pattern of stars in the night sky, because our Mundus is a reflection of Aetherius. However, to test this theory we would need a comprehensive map of every wayshrine site on Tamriel, a task too daunting to contemplate, so proof of this hypothesis, if true, will have to come from another source.\nLord Corvus was also a renowned conjurer, who devised and promulgated the standard \"portal\" spells now popularized by the &lt;a href=\"Mages%20Guild%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Mages Guild&lt;/a&gt;. (His work was based on the pioneering research of the &lt;a href=\"Ayleid\"&gt;Ayleid&lt;/a&gt; sorcerer known to history as \"The Transmigrant.\" But that is liquor for a different cocktail.) Corvus theorized that, if one only knew how, the wayshrines could be used as a permanent portal network by which one could travel rapidly across Tamriel. He speculated that such a \"fast traveler\" would need to somehow attune himself to a wayshrine, which would add its \"node\" to the traveler's \"web of sojourn.\"\nHowever, in order to learn how to do this, the great Direnni wizard believed a mortal's soul would have to be, temporarily or permanently, \"unmoored from the Mundus.\" I am not at all certain what that phrase means, and if Lord Corvus understood it, none of his written memoirs explain what he meant by it. Based on my studies of the notebooks left behind in Lord Corvus' workshop in &lt;a href=\"Direnni%20Tower\"&gt;Direnni Tower&lt;/a&gt;, proof and implementation of this theory eluded him, and eventually he abandoned it to return to perfecting variations on &lt;a href=\"Koron%27s%20Peremptory%20Summons\"&gt;Koron's Peremptory Summons&lt;/a&gt;."}

This channeled single-target attack is fast, hits hard, and allows you to move at full speed while executing it, so it's the perfect attack for situations where you need to be quick on your feet!\n\"Some of the most effective archers in history were able to devastate their foes by firing arrows in quick succession with pinpoint accuracy. This was our inspiration for Rapid Fire, an Ultimate that allows you to focus fire on a single target with a lethal barrage of arrows. We wanted to emphasize mobility as well. Unlike other channeled abilities in the game, you are able to move freely at full speed while using Rapid Fire and its morphs.\nThis Ultimate synergizes nicely with Poison Injection due to the high damage it dishes out while you're channeling, and hits harder and harder as your hail of arrows reduces your target's health.\"\nDESTRUCTION STAFF\n&lt;a href=\"Elemental%20Storm\"&gt;Elemental Storm&lt;/a&gt;: Enemy troops closing in? Drop a cataclysmic storm in their path and watch the devastation ensue. This instant-cast ground target area-of-effect attack creates a storm that builds for two seconds, then lays waste to all enemies in the area by dealing Magic Damage over time. The storm type will be Fire, Frost, or Shock, depending on the type of Destruction Staff you currently wield.\nMorphs\n&lt;a href=\"Eye%20of%20the%20Storm%20%28Skill%29\"&gt;Eye of the Storm&lt;/a&gt;: If you ever find yourself surrounded by the enemy, this Elemental Storm morph is the answer. It creates a cataclysmic storm with you at its center, dealing Magic Damage over time to all nearby enemies. This instant-cast point-blank area-of-effect Ultimate will also follow you as you move.\n\"As a master of the elements, we wanted those who use the Destruction Staff to be able to wreak havoc over a large swath of the battlefield. Elemental Rage covers a larger area than any other Ultimate. The total damage on this ability is also some of the highest in the game. To counterbalance its massive area coverage and high damage, this Ultimate's cost is appropriately higher than its counterparts.\nIn true elemental fashion, the Elemental Rage morph grants access to unique bonuses based on the Destruction Staff type used. Frost locks enemies into place to help ensure they take full damage from the storm. Shock offers the highest total damage, but requires the target to be contained within the storm for the full duration. Fire deals the most damage each hit, making it ideal for killing foes before they have a chance to retaliate. Use of this ability is particularly effective in dungeons with a high density of enemies or against large groups of enemy players in PVP.\"\nDUAL WIELD\n&lt;a href=\"Lacerate\"&gt;Lacerate&lt;/a&gt;: Speed, precision, and finesse define duel wielding, and Lacerate utilizes them all. Unleash a flurry of attacks on all enemies in front of you, dealing Physical Damage and bleeding damage-over-time, and replenishing your health for 50% of the damage done. They'll never know what hit them!\nMorphs\n&lt;a href=\"Rend\"&gt;Rend&lt;/a&gt;: Your slashes cut deeper and last longer with this Lacerate morph. When used, it doubles the both the duration of Lacerate's Physical Damage as well as its bleeding damage-over-time.\n&lt;a href=\"Thrive%20in%20Chaos\"&gt;Thrive in Chaos&lt;/a&gt;: The greater number of enemies you face, the more you benefit. With this morph, each enemy you hit increases your damage done by 5% for the duration of Lacerate, up to a maximum of 30% more damage done.\n\"For Dual Wield, our goal was to create an Ultimate that had both an offensive and defensive component. We wanted this Ultimate to put long-term pressure on the enemy's health bar so you could get kills with a build that otherwise lacks burst damage. If you enjoy a more defensive playstyle, Lacerate (and especially the Rend morph that doubles Lacerate's duration) will help you gain the upper hand in drawn-out encounters.\"\nONE HAND AND SHIELD\n&lt;a href=\"Shield%20Wall%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Shield Wall&lt;/a&gt;: Hold the line, guardian! Shield-bearing warriors are the foundation of a strong defense, and Shield Wall is the pinnacle of shield mastery. Activate this Ultimate to reinforce your shield and make your stand, automatically blocking all attacks at no cost for the duration of the ability.\nMorphs\n&lt;a href=\"Shield%20Discipline\"&gt;Shield Discipline&lt;/a&gt;: Your efficiency in battle with a one-handed weapon and shield is unmatched. When active, your Shield Wall Ultimate also reduces your One Hand and Shield ability costs by 100%.\n&lt;a href=\"Spell%20Wall\"&gt;Spell Wall&lt;/a&gt;: Your knowledge of defensive techniques has been enhanced with arcane knowledge. When you activate Shield Wall, you gain the additional benefit of automatically reflecting all projectiles cast at you for the duration of the ability.\n\"Players who prefer defensive roles and playstyles have long expressed the desire to be able to continuously block. We're okay with giving players options to increase the up time on block, but want there to be a tradeoff for doing so. We also want the act of being in a perma-block stance to be fun. Shield Wall lets you block all attacks while also moving at full speed, regenerating Stamina at the normal rate, and allowing you to use abilities that have a cast time. This Ultimate has a low cost so it can be used frequently, but it does take up your Ultimate slot.\nAs the morph of Power Bash, Power Slam gives a bonus damage when blocking and pairs great with Shield Wall.\"\nRESTORATION STAFF\n&lt;a href=\"Panacea%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Panacea&lt;/a&gt;: Practitioners of the healing arts are keenly attuned to the welfare of nearby allies, even in the most heated situations. Using a Restoration Staff as an extension of their awareness, skilled healers are able to unleash powerful rejuvenating energies to heal themselves or an ally over time.\nMorphs\n&lt;a href=\"Life%20Giver\"&gt;Life Giver&lt;/a&gt;: With Restoration Staff in hand, you become a veritable wellspring of life replenishment. In addition to the above benefits, using the Panacea Ultimate also automatically casts &lt;a href=\"Regeneration%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Regeneration&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Blessing%20of%20Protection\"&gt;Blessing of Protection&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Steadfast%20Ward%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Steadfast Ward&lt;/a&gt; at no cost. Healing for everyone!\n&lt;a href=\"Light%27s%20Champion\"&gt;Light's Champion&lt;/a&gt;: Your healing efforts are bolstered with mighty offensive and defensive forces. Every time you cast Panacea, any friendly target you heal also gains &lt;a href=\"Major%20Force\"&gt;Major Force&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Major%20Protection\"&gt;Major Protection&lt;/a&gt; for 5 seconds increasing their Critical Damage done by 30% and reducing their damage taken by 30%.\n\"The Restoration Staff Ultimate gives us the opportunity to expand each class's toolkit by including a potent heal. When used, Panacea allows you to provide heals that rival Rushed Ceremony in power every second without having to spend Magicka, while freeing you up to use other attacks. As all Ultimates scale off of a player's highest maximum resource, this gives Stamina builds more options to play in a support role.\"\nTWO-HANDED\n&lt;a href=\"Berserker%20Strike\"&gt;Berserker Strike&lt;/a&gt;: Activate this formidable instant-cast Ultimate to sway the tide of battle against even the most heavily armored opponents. With a vicious blow from your two-handed weapon, you'll deal heavy Physical Damage to your target that ignores their Resistance. You also get the added benefit of both Physical and Spell Resistance equal to the amount ignored for 8 Seconds.\nMorphs\n&lt;a href=\"Berserker%20Rage%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Berserker Rage&lt;/a&gt;: Empowered by the thrill of battle, your Berserker Strike grants you immunity to all disabling, snare, and immobilization effects for the duration of the ability.\n&lt;a href=\"Onslaught\"&gt;Onslaught&lt;/a&gt;: Killing an enemy with this Berserker Strike morph immediately refunds the Ultimate cost. You'll be unstoppable!\n\"When designing the Two-Handed Ultimate, we were aiming for a brawler-style attack that would be uniquely powerful, but also increase survivability for melee builds. Berserker Strike does both of these things. It's the only attack that ignores the target's armor while buffing yours.\nTry using Berserker Strike defensively against a high armor target to buff yourself, or more offensively against a light armor target to get them into execution range.\""}

{"id": "16658", "revid": "32911304", "url": "https://elderscrolls.fandom.com/wiki?curid=16658", "title": "Weapons (Oblivion)", "text": "A Weapon is a piece of equipment that can be used to deal &lt;a href=\"Damage%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;damage&lt;/a&gt; to any person or &lt;a href=\"Creatures%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;creature&lt;/a&gt;. Weapons are made from a variety of materials, such as common &lt;a href=\"Steel%20Weapons%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;Steel&lt;/a&gt;, to less common &lt;a href=\"Glass%20Weapons%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;Glass&lt;/a&gt;. Damage and &lt;a href=\"speed\"&gt;speed&lt;/a&gt; of a weapon is determined by its strength, the material it is made of, the &lt;a href=\"Encumbrance%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;weight&lt;/a&gt;, and the &lt;a href=\"Skills%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;skill&lt;/a&gt; of the &lt;a href=\"Characters%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;character&lt;/a&gt; wielding it. The main exception is a &lt;a href=\"Staves%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;staff&lt;/a&gt;, which is not used as a &lt;a href=\"melee\"&gt;melee&lt;/a&gt; weapon, but rather one that propels &lt;a href=\"magic\"&gt;magic&lt;/a&gt;al attacks towards a target. The staff can be used regardless of &lt;a href=\"level\"&gt;level&lt;/a&gt; or skills.\nWeapons and &lt;a href=\"Armor%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;armor&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Cyrodiil\"&gt;Cyrodiil&lt;/a&gt; come in an array of materials. These nearly always go in a consistent order of quality: if a &lt;a href=\"Daggers%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;dagger&lt;/a&gt; of one material is better than a dagger of another, then armor of the first material will also be superior to the second. One point that is frequently confused is &lt;a href=\"Dremora%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;Dremora&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Daedric%20Weapons%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;Daedric&lt;/a&gt; equipment. While identical in appearance and weight, Dremora equipment is vastly inferior in quality, equivalent to &lt;a href=\"steel\"&gt;steel&lt;/a&gt;. Otherwise, weight is correlated with quality.\nDue to \"Oblivion's\" leveling system, rarity for higher end &lt;a href=\"Items%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;items&lt;/a&gt; is nearly nonexistent. At level 20+, &lt;a href=\"Bandits%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;Bandits&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Marauder%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;Marauders&lt;/a&gt; frequently roam with full sets of Glass or Daedric equipment.\nKeep in mind, it is possible to deal physical damage without a weapon, through the &lt;a href=\"Hand-to-Hand%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;Hand-to-Hand&lt;/a&gt; skill.\nNormal vs. Enchanted Weapons.\n\"Normal weapons\" are basic weapons that are not &lt;a href=\"Enchanting%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;enchanted&lt;/a&gt;, meaning they do not have any additional &lt;a href=\"Magic%20Effects%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;magic effects&lt;/a&gt;, such as magical damage. Normal weapons cannot be used to attack certain ethereal creatures, such as &lt;a href=\"Ghost%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;ghosts&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Wraith%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;wraiths&lt;/a&gt;. The exceptions to this rule are &lt;a href=\"Silver%20Weapons%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;Silver&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Daedric%20Weapons%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;Daedric&lt;/a&gt; weapons, which do not have to be &lt;a href=\"Enchanting%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;enchanted&lt;/a&gt; to inflict damage on ethereal enemies.\n&lt;a href=\"Enchanted%20Weapons%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;Weapons enchanted&lt;/a&gt; with a &lt;a href=\"Soul%20Gem%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;Soul Gem&lt;/a&gt; will cast the enchanted spell(s) on \"strike\". This means that whenever a successful strike is made on a target, the effect will also activate and hit the target. These magical weapons have a certain number of charges, indicating how many times the effect can be activated. When the weapon's charges are exhausted, it will only do its base damage with no additional effects. Weapons can be recharged using filled Soul Gems, or a &lt;a href=\"Varla%20Stone\"&gt;Varla Stone&lt;/a&gt;, which will recharge all of the enchanted weapons in the player's inventory. Soul Gems restore a specified number of charges, which is dependent upon their soul level: &lt;a href=\"Petty%20Soul%20Gem%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;Petty&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Lesser%20Soul%20Gem%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;Lesser&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Common%20Soul%20Gem%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;Common&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Greater%20Soul%20Gem%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;Greater&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Grand%20Soul%20Gem%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;Grand&lt;/a&gt;. In addition, certain &lt;a href=\"Characters%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;NPCs&lt;/a&gt; will recharge enchanted weapons for a fee. This is a common service among members of the &lt;a href=\"Mages%20Guild%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;Mages Guild&lt;/a&gt;, but otherwise rare.\nWeapon health.\nWeapon health is an indicator of a weapon's condition. If a weapon's health is reduced, it will do less damage. When its health reaches zero, the weapon breaks and becomes unusable (broken items are marked with a split orange circle in the inventory). Damaged weapons can be repaired using &lt;a href=\"Repair%20Hammer%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;repair hammers&lt;/a&gt;, or they can be taken to an NPC who performs repair services. Any &lt;a href=\"Merchants%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;merchant&lt;/a&gt; selling weapons or armor will perform repairs for a fee; to access this service, activate the person and then click the icon of a hammer. Select the item in need of repairs from a list of all the items in the player's inventory which are not at maximum health. &lt;a href=\"Fighters%20Guild%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;Fighters Guild&lt;/a&gt; porters also provide repair services to members, and charge less than vendors for their services.\nThe Hero will have to be at least a &lt;a href=\"Skill%20Perk\"&gt;Journeyman&lt;/a&gt; rank in the &lt;a href=\"Armorer%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;Armorer&lt;/a&gt; skill if they want to repair magical items themselves. Note that repairing enchanted weapons does not recharge them.\nReach.\nA weapon's reach determines how close the character must be to the opponent for the weapon to connect. Weapons such as daggers have a minimal reach, while &lt;a href=\"Claymores%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;claymores&lt;/a&gt; have a far greater reach (more than double that of a &lt;a href=\"Daggers%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;dagger&lt;/a&gt;). &lt;a href=\"Bows%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;Bows&lt;/a&gt; have the greatest reach, since they fire a projectile far beyond the normal attack range of a melee weapon. The distance an &lt;a href=\"Arrows%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;arrow&lt;/a&gt; flies from a bow depends on how much the bow is drawn; firing arrows rapidly will result in very short arcs, while slowly drawing a shot can fire it beyond visual range.\nAttack speed.\nDifferent weapons have different attack speeds, which affects how much damage can be dealt over a certain amount of time. The &lt;a href=\"Speed%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;Speed&lt;/a&gt; attribute influences how fast a weapon can be swung/fired. Smaller weapons have greater attack speeds, though they also have shorter reaches and generally do less damage with each hit. Daggers have the fastest attack speed; &lt;a href=\"Warhammers%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;warhammers&lt;/a&gt; have the slowest."}

You made it to the ice caves.\nIf you're reading this, it's because you're working a shift mining in the ice caves. If you've never done this sort of work before, rest assured there's always a need for more miners. Here's some free advice. If you don't read this, we're not responsible for what happens to you.\n1) You can always ask questions from the more experienced miners. If they've lived long enough to make it through a few seasons down here, they've got good advice. The miners who don't ask advice tend to make mistakes. I won't lie to you: some of those mistakes can be fatal. If you get hurt, you'll need some of that coin you've been saving up.\n2) Always keep an eye out for a possible attack from the enemy. If it's been a while since we've found something valuable, we can't afford to deploy lots of guards. Everyone's got to get a pick and pitch in. We know that makes us vulnerable to attack from bandits, invaders, animals, or worse, but if we don't keep making a profit, we'll have to close the mine.\n3) Claim jumpers, bandits, and invaders are always a problem. We recruit as many folks as we can, just in case an organized force comes in and tries to take over. Soldiers seem to think that mines are valuable targets for conquest, but of course, they don't want to do any of the actual work here. If you see any signs of suspicious activity, contact one of the more experienced miners or the foreman. Right now, we're paying you. If soldiers seize this place, you're going to be slave labor. Don't think it couldn't happen.\n4) I know it's cold. Even if you're a &lt;a href=\"Nords%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Nord&lt;/a&gt;, you're going to find the cold miserable, and I don't care. Heat melts ice, and we can't heat up the mines too much, or all that ice is going to melt. A collapsing tunnel is even worse than the mine getting attacked.\n5) Do what you're told. I know you think you've got an instinct of where to dig and where not to dig, but that's not your job. There's always going to be someone in a mine who has more experience than you do, and they're the ones who decide where you dig. They'll tell you what they're looking for. Once you've found a deposit, tell your superior and focus on harvesting it as fast as you can. Time is money.\n6) Keep an eye out for danger. You've made it through enough training to recognize the signs of a buttress or brace that's about to collapse, the color a flame makes when exposed to harmful gas, the scent of hazardous gas, and the chances of a cave-in. When in doubt, point it out. We'd rather have you look like a fool and be wrong than chance losing valuable lives because you didn't tell someone.\n7) Think of home, but be careful what you say. We all have folks at home. If you miss them, there's someone nearby who misses home more. You're not here to talk. You're here to dig. I know some of the miners are lucky enough to have family staying in quarters nearby, but that costs money, and you can't afford that yet. You're probably working here to raise money for your precious loved ones, so remember that when you're working hard. No one wants to hear about your family troubles or your money troubles, because we all have them. If you didn't have them, you wouldn't be working here. Either that, or you're here because you're expecting to have a lucrative career mining in the ice caves.\n8) This is a job. We're paying you. If you can't show up for your shift on time or do what you're told, you won't have a job anymore. It's a long walk back to town, especially when you don't have any gold. Do what you're told, and you'll get your pay. And remember, it could be worse. If this mine gets attacked, you'll be slave labor real quick. Be grateful you're getting paid. You're lucky to have this job.\nThank you for doing what you were told and reading this. Hope you enjoyed the break.\nNow get back to work."}

They are a military order of &lt;a href=\"Alinor%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Alinor&lt;/a&gt; which form the &lt;a href=\"Summerset%20Isles%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Summerset Isles&lt;/a&gt;' main defense force. The Gryphon Knights are a point of patriotic pride for the Altmer, who have composed songs of the deeds of the order.\nBased in the city of &lt;a href=\"Cloudrest%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Cloudrest&lt;/a&gt; atop Eton Nir, the Welkynars remained vigilant to answer any urgent calls for aid. This need for quick mobility is what led to the first Welkynars to tame the native gryphons and use them as their &lt;a href=\"Mounts%20%28Collection%29\"&gt;mounts&lt;/a&gt;. Given the city's central location on &lt;a href=\"Sumerset\"&gt;the island&lt;/a&gt;, and the help of these flying creatures, the Welkynars were able to quickly render aid across the entire realm. While any member of Summerset's governance or military could petition the Wekynars for aid, accepting the petition was at the order's discretion. Between assignments, Welkynars patrolled Summerset for signs of danger, often stopping in cities and collecting information on any potential threats.\nDescription.\nThe Welkynars consists of only four members at any one time\u2014a representation of each of the cardinal directions. Typically, each Welkynar takes on an apprentice before they retire. When the Welkynar eventually does either retire or die in the line of duty, their apprentice replaces them. Joining the ranks of the Welkynars is a long and arduous process. Initiates are first required to prove themselves highly capable in battle in order to be eligible. Although the order is well known for producing the finest &lt;a href=\"battlemage\"&gt;battlemage&lt;/a&gt;s within Summerset, magical ability is not necessarily a requirement to join.\nIn addition to battle prowess, initiates were expected to find a wild gryphon egg and raise the hatching until fully grown. The initiate and hatchling would undergo magical rituals in order to create a supernatural bond between the two, resulting in the gryphon becoming the initiate's personal mount and life-long companion trained to fight by their side. Some claim the gryphon becomes an extension of the initiate's very being, sharing each other's thoughts, feelings and needs. Indeed, the gryphon itself became the Welkynar's sigil and their affinity and respect for the creature was such that their arms and armor were replete with symbology and feathers.\nHistory.\nAround &lt;a href=\"2E%20583\"&gt;2E 583&lt;/a&gt; the Welkynars captured a dangerous &lt;a href=\"Sea%20Sload\"&gt;Sea Sload&lt;/a&gt; sorceress named &lt;a href=\"Z%27Maja\"&gt;Z'Maja&lt;/a&gt; and brought her to Cloudrest. Unbeknownst to the Welkynars, Z'Maja was plotting to capture the city by allowing the Gryphon knights to take her captive and bring her into their home where she could enact her plan.\nOnce within the city walls, Z'Maja escaped confinement and used &lt;a href=\"shadow%20magic\"&gt;shadow magic&lt;/a&gt;s and a &lt;a href=\"Daedra%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Daedric&lt;/a&gt; amulet in her possession to &lt;a href=\"Slavery\"&gt;enslave&lt;/a&gt; three of the four Welkynar knights and capture Cloudrest. With the aid of numerous adventurers, Olorime, the surviving Welkynar knight, fought back against Z'Maja and retook the city. What became of the enslaved Welkynars is debated \u2014 some reports claim that she was forced to kill her former comrades who had been reduced to shadow &lt;a href=\"Thrall%20%28Online%29\"&gt;thralls&lt;/a&gt;, however other accounts say that they were freed after Z'Maja's defeat."}

With proper knowledge, Welkynd stones could be recharged.

The remaining stones could be still found inside remains of their cities hundreds of years after, at least up to the end of &lt;a href=\"Third%20Era\"&gt;Third Era&lt;/a&gt;.

Attributes that are increased are done up to the point of being equivalent to 160. The higher the level of a character, the less their attributes will be affected by battle leveling. It was first introduced in &lt;a href=\"Update%201\"&gt;Update 1&lt;/a&gt; for &lt;a href=\"Cyrodiil%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Cyrodiil&lt;/a&gt; to make player-versus-player content fairer and was later applied to the &lt;a href=\"Imperial%20City%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Imperial City&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Gold%20Coast%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Gold Coast&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Hew%27s%20Bane\"&gt;Hew's Bane&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Wrothgar%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Wrothgar&lt;/a&gt;. Battle leveling was later applied to all zones in &lt;a href=\"Update%2012\"&gt;Update 12&lt;/a&gt; with &lt;a href=\"One%20Tamriel\"&gt;One Tamriel&lt;/a&gt;, where Alliances zones had previously set content levels depending on the character's Alliance. The battle level applied to &lt;a href=\"Official%20Plug-ins%20%28Online%29\"&gt;DLC&lt;/a&gt; zones prior to Update 12 was set at 15 and later 150.\nAttributes.\nBattle leveling increases the following attributes:\nBattle leveling accounts for the number of attributes that have been invested into health, stamina and magicka when upscaling maximum resource values. The more points that are invested into a resource, the smaller the bonus will be for that resource. The value of each resource will still remain proportionate according to the relative investment.\nItems.\nThe battle leveling system scales up the effectiveness of items according to their level and quality, including &lt;a href=\"Weapons%20%28Online%29\"&gt;weapons&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Armor%20%28Online%29\"&gt;armor&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Potions%20%28Online%29\"&gt;potions&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Poisons%20%28Online%29\"&gt;poisons&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Food%20%28Online%29\"&gt;food&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Beverages%20%28Online%29\"&gt;beverages&lt;/a&gt;. Items of higher quality maintain the same proportion of increasing effectiveness over lower quality items, in the following order: Normal, , , , and . The weapon damage, armor rating, and magnitudes of &lt;a href=\"Enchanting%20%28Online%29\"&gt;enchantments&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"traits\"&gt;traits&lt;/a&gt; are all upscaled. The magnitude of these stats will be reduced as the character levels beyond them, meaning that only items at the character's level will be upscaled to the equivalent of 160. Items below the character's level will only upscale to the commensurate level relative to 160. For example, a character at level 40 with a level 30 item will only have that item scaled up to the equivalent of 60. The equipment bonus rating in the character menu is indicative of how much a character's stats are being battle leveled. Four gold stars indicate that the character's equipment is not being battle leveled, because their stats are already at the level they would have otherwise been increased to.\nAbilities.\nAbilities are battle leveled and also modified by the character's maximum magicka and spell damage for abilities that scale off magicka or maximum stamina and physical damage for abilities that scale off stamina, which are also battle leveled. Abilities continue to increase in magnitude and effectiveness as they rank up from I to IV. The cost of an ability is proportionate to the maximum amount of the resource it costs to use the ability and will still continue to decrease as it ranks up.\nResource nodes.\nResources nodes found throughout the world are battle leveled according to the character's relevant passive crafting &lt;a href=\"Skills%20%28Online%29\"&gt;skills&lt;/a&gt; unlocked and their level, with half of all resources found being appropriate for the character's skills and the other half appropriate to their level. For example, a level 30 character with &lt;a href=\"Metalworking\"&gt;Metalworking&lt;/a&gt; II will have half of all blacksmithing resource nodes be for &lt;a href=\"high%20iron%20ore\"&gt;high iron ore&lt;/a&gt; which corresponds to levels 16\u201324 unlocked with Metalworking II, and they will have the other half of all blacksmithing resource nodes be for &lt;a href=\"Orichalcum%20Ore%20%28Online%29\"&gt;orichalcum ore&lt;/a&gt; which corresponds to levels 26\u201334 because they are within that level range, even if they have not unlocked Metalworking III. This is applicable for all crafting skills when gathering leveled resources. Characters whose level and passive skill rank align will have every resource node be of the same type and will not find any different resources."}

They fought each other for several days. However, Numinex and Olaf were too evenly matched for either to secure victory.

This quest is only available if the Dragonborn joined the Stormcloaks.\nBackground.\n\"I am to join Ulfric Stormcloak in the final attack on Solitude, putting an end to the Imperial Legion in Skyrim, once and for all.\"\nWalkthrough.\nAlongside &lt;a href=\"Ulfric%20Stormcloak%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Ulfric Stormcloak&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Galmar%20Stone-Fist\"&gt;Galmar Stone-Fist&lt;/a&gt; and an army of &lt;a href=\"Stormcloaks\"&gt;Stormcloak warriors&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"Last%20Dragonborn\"&gt;Dragonborn&lt;/a&gt; leads to pursue &lt;a href=\"General%20Tullius%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;General Tullius&lt;/a&gt; to surrender to the &lt;a href=\"Stormcloak%20Rebellion\"&gt;Stormcloak Rebellion&lt;/a&gt;.\nOutside of &lt;a href=\"Castle%20Dour%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Castle Dour&lt;/a&gt; Ulfric will begin his rousing speech:\n\"This is it men! It's time to make this city ours! We come to this moment carried by the sacrifices and the courage of our fellows. Those who have fallen. And those still bearing the shields to our right.\"\n\"On this day, our enemy will witness the fullness of our determination, the true depth of our anger and the exhalted righteousness of our cause. The gods are watching. The spirits of our ancestors are stirring. And the men under suns yet to dawn will be transformed by what we do here today. Fear neither pain, nor darkness.\"\n\"For Sovngarde awaits those who die with weapons in their hands, and courage in their hearts. We now fight our way to Castle Dour to cut the head off the legion itself! And in that moment, the gods will look down and see Skyrim as she was meant to be. Full of Nords who are mighty, powerful, and free! Ready now! Everyone, with me! For the sons and daughters of Skyrim!\"\nAttacking the city.\nThe Dragonborn must enter the city with Ulfric Stormcloak, Galmar Stone-Fist, and a group of Stormcloaks. &lt;a href=\"Imperial%20Legion%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Imperial&lt;/a&gt; soldiers will storm out of different places, to attack. Be careful not to dwell here for too long, as the Imperial soldiers simply respawn in groups as they are killed. Move on into the city, break through the barricades and head left. More Imperials will spawn in the courtyard. Killing them is not required, and they will spawn ad infinitum. Door to Tullius' chambers can be found immediately left of the last barrier.\nIt is entirely possible to infinitely increase combat skills with this battle. As long as the Dragonborn does not kill the archers on top of the roofs just before the General is encountered, Imperial soldiers will continue to spawn in the courtyard. This can be quite useful to level combat skills. However, accidentally attacking Ulfric or Galmar too many times will cause them to become hostile. Transforming into &lt;a href=\"Werewolf%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;werewolf&lt;/a&gt; form will also cause the Stormcloak soldiers to become hostile. You can also use &lt;a href=\"Odahviing%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Odahviing&lt;/a&gt; as heavy firepower against the Imperials and the Stormcloaks will not be hostille towards him.\nAfter defeating all the soldiers stationed in the city streets, Ulfric will enter Castle Dour to confront General Tullius and Legate Rikke. Once inside, Rikke and Tullius will be found in the war room. Tullius, having given up at this point, will offer little resistance. However, Rikke will refuse to allow Ulfric to kill her general, saying that she would rather die for the cause she believes in than surrender.\nUlfric: \"Secure the door.\"\nGalmar: \"Already done.\"\nRikke: \"Ulfric. Stop.\"\nUlfric: \"Stop what? Taking Skyrim back from those who'd leave her to rot?\"\nRikke. \"You're wrong. Ulfric. We need the Empire. Without it Skyrim will assuredly fall to the Dominion.\"\"\nGalmar: \"You were there with us. You saw it. The day the Empire signed that damn treaty was the day the Empire died.\"\nUlfric: \"The Empire is weak, obsolete. Look at how far we've come and with so little. When we're done rooting out Imperial influence here at home, then we will take our war to the Aldmeri Dominion.\"\nRikke: \"You're a damn fool.\"\nGalmar: \"Stand aside woman. We've come for the General.\"\nRikke: \"He has given up. But I have not.\"\nUlfric: \"Rikke. Go. You're free to leave.\"\nRikke: \"I'm also free to stay and fight for what I believe in.\"\nUlfric: \"You're also free to die for it.\"\nRikke: \"This is what you wanted? Shield brothers and sisters killing each other? Families torn apart? This is the Skyrim you want?!\"\nGalmar: \"Damnit woman, stand aside.\"\nRikke: \"That's not the Skyrim I want to live in.\"\nUlfric: \"Rikke. You don't have to do this.\"\nRikke: \"You've left me no choice... Talos preserve us.\"\nUlfric can be interrupted during his speech to be spoken to about Rikke:\n\"War always comes down to this, doesn't it? A single truth-laden moment.\"\nInside, head to General Tullius and &lt;a href=\"Legate%20Rikke%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Legate Rikke&lt;/a&gt;. Fight until Tullius surrenders to Ulfric and Galmar. After the conversation, Ulfric will ask if the Dragonborn would prefer to be the one to end Tullius' life. Optionally, the Dragonborn may elect to have Ulfric do the killing. Ulfric will give the Dragonborn his Sword of Devouring (in v1.9 a leveled Sword of the Vampire), which absorbs enemy health when struck. The statistics of this weapon are level dependent.\nWith a prayer to Talos being her final words, Rikke pulls out her sword to fight for what she believes in, as will the General. It is not long before she falls, and only Tullius remains. When the latter has also been beaten, he will surrender to Ulfric:\nTullius: \"Enough... enough...\"\nUlfric: \"This is it for you. Any last words before I send you to Oblivion?\"\nTullius: \"You realize this is exactly what they wanted.\"\nGalmar: \"What who wanted?\"\nTullius: \"The Thalmor. They stirred up trouble here. Forced us to divert needed resources and throw away good soldiers quelling this rebellion.\"\nUlfric: \"It's a little more than a rebellion, don't you think?\"\nGalmar: \"Heh.\"\nTullius: \"We aren't the bad guys you know.\"\nUlfric: \"Maybe not, but you certainly aren't the good guys.\"\nTullius: \"Perhaps you're right. But then what does that make you?\"\nUlfric: \"You just said it yourself.\"\nGalmar: \"It makes us right.\"\nTullius: \"And if I surrender?\"\nUlfric: \"The Empire I remember never surrendered.\"\nGalmar: \"That Empire is dead. And so are you.\"\nTullius: \"So be it.\"\nGalmar: \"Just kill him and let's be done with it already.\"\nUlfric: \"Come, Galmar. Where's your sense of the dramatic moment?\"\nGalmar: \"By the gods! If it's a good ending to some damn story you're after - perhaps the Dragonborn should be the one to do it.\"\nUlfric: \"Good point.\"\nUlfric will then turn to the Dragonborn and ask if they would have the honor of killing Tullius:\n\"Well, Dragonborn. What do you say? Do you want the honor?\"\nRegardless of which option is chosen, General Tullius will die.\nGalmar: \"Good. It's done.\"\nUlfric: \"Well, I suppose some kind of speech is in order.\"\nGalmar: \"I'll go gather the men in the courtyard.\"\nUlfric: \"And Elisif?\"\nGalmar: \"Don't you worry about her. I've sent my best men to round her up.\"\nIf spoken any time after Tullius' death while still in Castle Dour, Ulfric will allow the Dragonborn to keep his sword, and ask if they want to be included in Ulfric's speech.\n\"Stormblade. I want you to have my sword, a token of my appreciation. Now then. The men will expect a speech. Will you stand by my side? I wish to honor you, Dragonborn, and the truest of Stormcloaks.\"\nUlfric invites the Dragonborn to join him, while he addresses his people. Head outside, to find the Stormcloaks and Jarl &lt;a href=\"Elisif%20the%20Fair\"&gt;Elisif&lt;/a&gt; gathered. Here, Ulfric will make his speech, to enthusiastic applause.\nGalmar: \"And now, I present to you, Ulfric Stormcloak, hero of the people, liberator and High King of Skyrim!\"\nUlfric: \"I am indeed Ulfric Stormcloak, And indeed, there are many that call us heroes. But it is all of you who are the true heroes! It was you who fought a dying Empire who sunk its claws into our land, trying to drag us down with it. It was you who fought the Thalmor and their puppets who would have us deny our gods and our heritage. It was you who fought your kin who didn't understand our cause, who weren't willing to pay the price of our freedom. But more than that, it was you who fought for Skyrim, for our right to fight our own battles... To return to our glory and traditions, to determine our own future!\"\nSoldiers: \"[Cheering]\"\nUlfric: \"\"And it is for these reasons that I cannot accept the mantle of \"High King.\" Not until the Moot declares that title should adorn my shoulders will I accept it.\"\"\nSoldier: \"And what about Jarl Elisif?\"\nUlfric: \"Yes, what about the Lady Elisif? Will she put aside her personal hatred for me, and her misplaced love for the Emperor and his coin, so that the suffering of our people will end? Will she acknowledge that it is we who will determine Skyrim's future? Will she swear fealty to me, so all may know that we are at peace, and a new day has dawned?\"\nElisif: \"I do!\"\nUlfric: \"Then it is settled. The Jarl will continue to rule Solitude, I will garrison armies here to ward off Imperial attempts to reclaim the city. And in due time, the Moot will meet, and settle the claim to High King once and for all. There is much to do, and I need every able bodied man and woman committed to rebuilding Skyrim. A great darkness is growing, and soon we will be called to fight it, on these shores or abroad. The Aldmeri Dominion may have defeated the Empire, but it has not defeated Skyrim!\"\nSoldiers: \"[Cheering]\"\nAnd with his victory speech at last completed, Ulfric will then turn to Galmar for feedback on it:\nUlfric: \"How'd I do?\"\nGalmar: \"Eh, not so bad. Nice touch about the High King.\"\nUlfric: \"Thank you, I thought so, too.\"\nGalmar: \"It's a foregone conclusion, you know.\"\nUlfric: \"Oh, I know.\"\nGalmar: \"The Imperials aren't going to leave us alone. They still have camps in the hills. They'll continue to strike out at us, whenever and wherever they can.\"\nUlfric: \"I'm not afraid of the remnants of the Legion, in time they'll all give up and go home. What I fear, is that the Thalmor will see our victory here and turn greater attention to our shores. We must be prepared to face them.\"\nGalmar: \"Aye.\"\nUlfric: \nGalmar: \"May the gods preserve us all.\"\nUlfric: \"Come, Galmar. We've still much work to do.\"\nWith Tullius and Rikke dead and Elisif allowed to stay Jarl of Haafingar, the Civil War ends with the Stormcloaks having secured Skyrim's independence from the Mede Dynasty and restored Talos worship to the province."}

It took place in &lt;a href=\"Whiterun%20Hold\"&gt;Whiterun Hold&lt;/a&gt;.\nBackground.\nWhiterun Hold had been neutral territory during the Skyrim Civil War, with skirmishes on both sides taking place in the Hold and &lt;a href=\"Fort%20Greymoor\"&gt;Fort Greymoor&lt;/a&gt; switching hands between the Empire and Stormcloaks on a regular basis. Jarl Balgruuf refused the Legion's right to garrison troops in Whiterun city, on the other hand he also refused to acknowledge Ulfric's claim. Despite the neutrality of the Hold, Stormcloak forces already engaged with Whiterun's own troops, and Stormcloak assassins had been sent out to try and take out Jarl Balgruuf.\nAfter an unknown period of time, Ulfric started planning an attack on Whiterun. Shortly after Balgruuf got to know of this news, he declared his allegiance to the Empire, previously wishing to stay out of the war whenever possible.\nStormcloak.\nJarl Ulfric Stormcloak sent his axe to Whiterun, which Balgruuf returned, meaning he did not back the Stormcloaks. Since Ulfric Stormcloak saw those who weren't with him as against him, Balgruuf instantly ordered his steward to write a message to &lt;a href=\"General%20Tullius\"&gt;General Tullius&lt;/a&gt;, requesting Legionnaires.\nImperial.\nJarl Balgruuf, after getting a &lt;a href=\"message%20from%20General%20Tullius\"&gt;message from General Tullius&lt;/a&gt; in which some of Ulfric's plans were recorded, decided to send Ulfric his axe. Ulfric decided to send the axe back, which meant they would go to war, which is the response that Balgruuf expected.\nThe battle.\nThe Legionnaires sent by General Tullius arrived just in time to fight against the Stormcloaks and catapults were stationed in the city to ward off the invasion. The Stormcloaks however, had also brought catapults with them and intended to rain large fireballs on the city. Although the siege kept the frail city walls intact, the soldiers were forced to fight in the flames. The Imperial Legion had set up water brigades to mitigate the danger of fighting in an inferno and prevent the fires from getting out of control. The Imperials had blocked the first passage going into the wind district, and had set up various barricades in the city. Victory in the battle depended on if the Imperials could prevent the Stormcloaks from dropping the drawbridge, which was integral for keeping Whiterun from being overrun."}

I have been ordered to defend the outer walls and keep the rebels from taking the city.\"\nWalkthrough.\nOnce you finish talking to &lt;a href=\"Legate%20Quentin%20Cipius\"&gt;Legate Quentin Cipius&lt;/a&gt;, your objective is to meet with &lt;a href=\"Legate%20Rikke%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Legate Rikke&lt;/a&gt;. She is outside near the gate of Whiterun.\nUpon exiting &lt;a href=\"Dragonsreach\"&gt;Dragonsreach&lt;/a&gt;, the severity of the assault will become blatantly obvious. Flaming catapult rocks are raining down upon the Wind and Plains districts of &lt;a href=\"Whiterun%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Whiterun&lt;/a&gt;, and its populace is in a state of pandemonium, running about the city seeking shelter. City Guards are heading towards the city gates to aid the defense, and the sky has turned a sickly orange from the smoking buildings. Imperial Legionnaires are manning several catapults along the wall of the city facing the direction of the &lt;a href=\"Whiterun%20Stormcloak%20Camp\"&gt;Whiterun Stormcloak Camp&lt;/a&gt; to return fire on the Stormcloaks as they bombard the city from the safety of their camp.\nProceed to the staging area just outside the main gates. Legate Rikke will be giving a short motivational speech to the combined forces of Whiterun Guards and the new reinforcements of Imperial Soldiers.\n\"This is it men! This is an important day for the Empire and for the Legion. And for all of Skyrim. This is the day we send a message to Ulfric Stormcloak and the rebel Jarls who support him. But make no mistake. What we do here today, we do for Skyrim and her people. By cutting out the disease of this rebellion, we will make this country whole again!\"\n\"Ready now! Everyone, with me! For the Empire! For the Legion! Rrrrraaaaaaaaaaaaaaahhhhhhhhh!!!!\"\nOnce the speech is done, your new objective will be to defend the wooden barricades from the invading Stormcloak soldiers. If you enter the city at all during the battle, terrified citizens will be seen fleeing from the taverns and shops to their own homes, where they will lock the doors to prevent anyone from entering. All shop owners will lock their doors, including the taverns; stall owners will flee, as well.\nDefend the barricades by killing the Stormcloak soldiers trying to get in, which consist of both regular Stormcloak infantry and &lt;a href=\"Stormcloak%20General\"&gt;generals&lt;/a&gt;. If you fail to defend the barricades, you will have to fall back and defend the drawbridge instead. Failing to defend the drawbridge has little consequences, as the quest is impossible to fail unless you die. There will be a percentage count of how many Stormcloak soldiers are left. Once that count reaches 0%, your new objective will be to meet with Jarl &lt;a href=\"Balgruuf%20the%20Greater\"&gt;Balgruuf the Greater&lt;/a&gt; to hear a short victory speech.\nVictory speech.\nUpon being victorious, Jarl Balgruuf will deliver a speech to the men after Irileth makes an announcement.\nIrileth: \"Everyone, on me! The Jarl wishes to speak!\"\nJarl Balgruuf the Greater: \"Revel in your victory here today, even as the gods revel in your honor! They already sing of your valor and skill! The halls of Sovngarde are no doubt ringing with your praises! In defeating these Stormcloak traitors, you have proven the hollowness of their cause and the fullness of your hearts. The citizens of Whiterun are forever in your debt! But Ulfric will not stop here. No, he will continue to strike out against any true Nord who remains faithful to the Empire. He will continue to sow discord and chaos wherever he can. And so, we must each one of us, continue to fight this insurrection, lest our fallen brothers have died for naught! Lest our honor be lessened should we allow these bloodthristy beasts to prowl our lands! Carry on men, my gratitude and blessings go with you! For Whiterun! For the Empire!\""}

This quest is only available if the Dragonborn joined the Stormcloaks.\nBackground.\n\"Ulfric Stormcloak has ordered me to join Galmar Stone-Fist in taking the city of Whiterun.\"\nWalkthrough.\nAt this point, Whiterun and &lt;a href=\"Dragonsreach\"&gt;Dragonsreach&lt;/a&gt; will disappear from the map and the Dragonborn will not be able to fast travel to them, even if a house is owned or if there is a spouse in Whiterun. Only the surroundings of the city can be reached by fast travelling or use a &lt;a href=\"Carriage\"&gt;Carriage&lt;/a&gt;. Fighting in the Battle for Whiterun to finish the quest will return everything as they were before with additional debris from the battle.\nUpon arrival at the Whiterun Stormcloak Military Camp, Galmar will inspire the Stormcloak soldiers with a speech before running to attack the city while it is being bombarded by catapult fire from the Whiterun Stormcloak Camp:\nGalmar: \"\"This is it men! They say that our cause is false and that we are nothing more than thieves, thugs and murderers! But no! We are farmers! We are craftsmen! We are sons and daughters of shopkeepers, maid servants and soldiers! We are the sons and daughters of Skyrim! And we have come this far because our cause is true. Because we fight as one. And because our hearts are bursting with anger! What we do here today, we do for our country! For all the true Nords of Skyrim!\"\n\"Whiterun's walls are tall, but they are old and crumbling, like the Empire whose Legion lines them. They've barricades to block us, but we'll tear through them and the Imperials behind them! Our objective is the drawbridge. If we can find a way to drop it, the city will be ours! Everyone on me. Let's show these Imperial milk drinkers what true Nords look like! Rrrrraaaaaarrrrr!\"\"\nEntering the city.\nThe walls of Whiterun are defended by both Whiterun guards and &lt;a href=\"Imperial%20Soldier%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Imperial soldiers&lt;/a&gt;. The barricade is a simple wooden spike trap that is destroyed in a few hits.\nPast the barricade a few more soldiers will be encountered. Beyond them are battlements around the left side of the drawbridge. Directly above the bridge is the windlass used to lower it. Once the gate is lowered, the defenders will retreat back into Whiterun, and the Stormcloaks will pursue them. Opening the doors to Whiterun advances to the next quest objective.\nTaking Dragonsreach.\nThe battle rages on in the streets of Whiterun. There are impenetrable barriers in place that prevent taking some of the alternative paths deeper into the city. Several of Whiterun's populace can be encountered on the streets, but they are non combatants and it is still considered a crime to attack them openly (for example, &lt;a href=\"Vignar%20Gray-Mane\"&gt;Vignar Gray-Mane&lt;/a&gt; is standing directly behind a spike barrier near the entrance to Dragonsreach). It is necessary to fight through the city to Dragonsreach.\nUpon entry, three guards will attack, who can be killed in one hit by any attack. The Jarl himself will attack with three guards and his Housecarl, &lt;a href=\"Irileth\"&gt;Irileth&lt;/a&gt;. None of the guards have to be slain, as long as Balgruuf can be forced to ground and made to surrender.\nWhen Balgruuf surrenders, Vignar will walk in. After an argument over their views on the war, Balgruuf will face the Dragonborn and say that he thought better of them. He will then go up to the Jarl's Quarters to gather his belongings, along with the children and courtiers of his court, such as &lt;a href=\"Farengar%20Secret-Fire\"&gt;Farengar Secret-Fire&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Irileth\"&gt;Irileth&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Proventus\"&gt;Proventus&lt;/a&gt;.

But they are no match for Legionnaires. You are the best and the brightest warriors in Tamriel. Professional soldiers, fearless and devastating. The Emperor will be paying close attention to what happens here today. Men who distinguish themselves will be well rewarded. Ready now! Everyone, with me! For the Empire!

The Palace of the Kings is then raided, where Ulfric and his right-hand man &lt;a href=\"Galmar%20Stone-Fist\"&gt;Galmar Stone-Fist&lt;/a&gt; await.\nTullius: \"Secure the door.\"\nRikke: \"Already done, sir.\"\nTullius: \"Ulfric Stormcloak!

Any last requests before I send you to... to wherever you people go when you die.\"\nRikke: \"Sovngarde... sir.\"\nTullius: \"Right. Well?\"\nUlfric: \"Let the Dragonborn be the one to do it. It'll make for a better song.\"\nTullius: \"Song or not, I just want it done.\"\nAfter Ulfric is killed, General Tullius allows the Dragonborn to keep his leveled sword as a reward.\nRikke: \"Talos be with you...\"\nTullius: \"What was that, Legate?\"\nRikke: \"Nothing.

Let this day be a final warning to those who still call themselves Stormcloaks! We are turning the city over to Brunwulf Free-Winter, an honorable and faithful man! Many of you will be staying in Windhelm to aid the Jarl in restoring order and stamping out any embers of rebellion that may still smolder here! In appreciation for your exemplary service, I am doubling your pay and compensation for the widows of your fallen comrades!\"\nImperial Soldiers: (Cheer)\nTullius: \"I am proud of all of you!

All hail his legionaires!\"\nImperial Soldiers: (Cheer)\nUpon returning to Windhelm, &lt;a href=\"Brunwulf%20Free-Winter\"&gt;Brunwulf Free-Winter&lt;/a&gt; will become the new Jarl and will offer the Dragonborn the title of &lt;a href=\"Becoming%20Thane\"&gt;Thane of Eastmarch&lt;/a&gt;, as well as the opportunity to buy &lt;a href=\"Hjerim\"&gt;Hjerim&lt;/a&gt;, the house available in Windhelm (12,000). At this point the city is now under Imperial control, and thus the Stormcloak guards are replaced by Imperial soldiers, ending the &lt;a href=\"Skyrim%20Civil%20War\"&gt;Skyrim Civil War&lt;/a&gt; in the Empire's favor."}

With her enemies dead or fleeing she laid down on a boulder, and died."}

The battle was part of a bigger war to gain control of the island of &lt;a href=\"Betony\"&gt;Betony&lt;/a&gt;. The battle began as an average battle, however a sudden unnatural fog spread over Cryngaine Field, blinding the soldiers. When the mist lifted it was discovered that an arrow had killed King Lysandus, fired from a blinded Sentinel archer. However, unbeknownst to everyone except &lt;a href=\"Gothryd\"&gt;Gothryd&lt;/a&gt; and a few other people, it was not the king who died, but instead an impersonator, while Lysandus was actually leaving the battle.\nPrince Gothryd, King Lysandus' son, was crowned the new king of Daggerfall, and quickly took control of the armies of Daggerfall. The battle began to turn in Daggerfall's favor as the army's morale was boosted at the sight of their new king. Challenging Camaron in a duel in the mist of the battle, Gothryd slew &lt;a href=\"Camaron\"&gt;King Camaron&lt;/a&gt; of Sentinel. Panicked by the death of their king, the armies of Sentinel panicked. Lord &lt;a href=\"Oresme\"&gt;Oresme&lt;/a&gt;, one of Sentinel's commanders, formally surrendered to Daggerfall, giving up all rights to &lt;a href=\"Betony\"&gt;Betony&lt;/a&gt;. On the march back to Sentinel, he committed suicide because of the loss. As part of the formal peace treaty King Gothryd asked for the hand of Princess Aubk-i, the only daughter of the King Camaron and &lt;a href=\"Akorithi\"&gt;Queen Akorithi&lt;/a&gt;, as an attempt to keep peace in the region.\nAftermath.\nThe marriage of Gothryd and Aubk-i was partially successful, as while the marriage was intended for peace, many members of the royal courts of Sentinel viewed the princess as more a prisoner of war than a royal marriage to Daggerfall.\nMeanwhile, leaving to &lt;a href=\"Tamarilyne%20Point\"&gt;Tamarilyne Point&lt;/a&gt;, Lysandus and &lt;a href=\"Woodborne\"&gt;Woodborne&lt;/a&gt; were discussing the king's retirement as a group of &lt;a href=\"Minat\"&gt;Minat&lt;/a&gt; orcs meet the group, which are allied to Woodborne. Woodborne uses the orcs as an excuse to leave the group, and then after they are some ways away, commands the orcs to go kill Lysandus, who do so, and bury the body in a silver casket in a catacomb near Tamarilyne Point. This murder after the Battle of Cryngaine Field directly leads to the events that start ."}

The battle had occurred sometime after &lt;a href=\"Uriel%20Septim%20VII\"&gt;Uriel Septim VII&lt;/a&gt;'s death, which had started the Oblivion Crisis in Tamriel. An &lt;a href=\"Oblivion%20Gate\"&gt;Oblivion Gate&lt;/a&gt; had opened outside the gates of Kvatch, where the Gate had cleared the area with a wave of flames and despair. The &lt;a href=\"Daedric\"&gt;Daedric&lt;/a&gt; Army marched into the city of Kvatch and burned down the city into the rubble, leaving burned buildings, corpses, and Kvatch in a shadow of its former self. There were two survivor groups throughout the Battle, a large portion of the city's denizen lived on the outskirts of Kvatch, on the hills of the city-state. Another group was safeguarded by Martin Septim in the ruined &lt;a href=\"Chapel%20of%20Akatosh\"&gt;Chapel of Akatosh&lt;/a&gt;, ironic considering the events that play out later on. Traversing Kvatch was practically impossible, the chapel tower had collapsed onto the main road, while houses blocked the road going around the eastern wall. Arriving onto &lt;a href=\"Castle%20Kvatch\"&gt;Castle Kvatch&lt;/a&gt; requires to enter through the Kvatchense sewers and arriving onto the main town square.\nThe Battle was primarily on the Daedric's side until an &lt;a href=\"Hero%20of%20Kvatch\"&gt;estranged warrior&lt;/a&gt; reached the Kvatch outskirts and entered the Oblivion Gate, from there the warrior took the &lt;a href=\"Sigil%20Stone\"&gt;Sigil Stone&lt;/a&gt;, diminishing the Gate. The Kvatch Guard on the outer battlefield opened Kvatch and rendezvous with the survivors of the Akatosh Chapel. The warrior and &lt;a href=\"Savlian%20Matius\"&gt;Savlian Matius&lt;/a&gt; breached the Castle Kvatch barracks and defeated the Daedric General in the stronghold. It was there the warrior discovered the dead body of &lt;a href=\"Ormellius%20Goldwine\"&gt;Ormellius Goldwine&lt;/a&gt;, the then Count of Kvatch. With Kvatch secured, the County would slowly recover and eventually be completely rebuilt by the time the &lt;a href=\"Great%20War\"&gt;Great War&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;a href=\"Fourth%20Era\"&gt;Fourth Era&lt;/a&gt; had occurred. With the knowledge of the destruction of Oblivion Gates, the denizens of Tamriel were able to withstand the offensive power of the Daedra. Other victories would follow suit including the &lt;a href=\"Second%20Battle%20of%20Ione%27s%20Oblivion%20Gate\"&gt;Second Battle of Ione's Oblivion Gate&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Battle%20of%20Bruma\"&gt;Battle of Bruma&lt;/a&gt;."}

The event that began the march to war was the discovery by &lt;a href=\"House%20Dagoth\"&gt;House Dagoth&lt;/a&gt; that the Dwemer had discovered the &lt;a href=\"Heart%20of%20Lorkhan\"&gt;Heart of Lorkhan&lt;/a&gt; beneath &lt;a href=\"Red%20Mountain\"&gt;Red Mountain&lt;/a&gt;.\nThis led to heated negotiations between Nerevar and &lt;a href=\"Dumac%20Dwarfking\"&gt;Dumac Dwarfking&lt;/a&gt;. Upon being told by &lt;a href=\"Azura\"&gt;Azura&lt;/a&gt; that the Dwemer were building a &lt;a href=\"Numidium\"&gt;new god&lt;/a&gt; under the mountain, Nerevar and the &lt;a href=\"Tribunal\"&gt;Tribunal&lt;/a&gt; issued an ultimatum to the Dwemer to stop work on their new god, or face destruction. Dumac, ignorant of the work &lt;a href=\"Kagrenac\"&gt;Kagrenac&lt;/a&gt; had done on the Heart, refused. And so the Chimer and Dwemer went to war. Another account states that &lt;a href=\"Wulfharth\"&gt;Wulfharth&lt;/a&gt; was resurrected to lead an army of &lt;a href=\"orc\"&gt;orc&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"Nords\"&gt;Nords&lt;/a&gt;, and members of &lt;a href=\"House%20Dagoth\"&gt;House Dagoth&lt;/a&gt; against the Chimer, and reconquer territory they lost when their first empire fell.\nBattle.\nSeveral sources agree that the battle happens when Nerevar draws most of the Dwemer away from &lt;a href=\"Red%20Mountain\"&gt;Red Mountain&lt;/a&gt;, while others indicate that the battle was an ambush, or as a final last stand of the Dwemer with an array of allies from other provinces, or as a combined ambush of the Nords by both the Dwemer and the Chimer.\nThe exact details of the battle are also unclear, although all agree that both the Dwemer and House Dagoth are defeated during the battle. Those sources that claim other sides are present at the battle also say they are defeated.\nConfrontation in the Heart Chamber.\nThe main confrontation is likely to have been a diversion, during which Nerevar and the future &lt;a href=\"Tribunal\"&gt;Tribunal&lt;/a&gt;, along with their ally &lt;a href=\"Voryn%20Dagoth\"&gt;Voryn Dagoth&lt;/a&gt;, either by stealth or some form of treason from within the Dwemer and House Dagoth forces, infiltrated the chamber where the Heart of Lorkhan was kept.\nOnce inside, the infiltrators confronted Dumac and chief Tonal Architect &lt;a href=\"Kagrenac\"&gt;Kagrenac&lt;/a&gt; in the chamber where the Heart of Lorkhan was. Dumac is slain during the confrontation, either by Nerevar, Wulfharth, or a Khajiit named Dro'Zira.\nThose narratives which support the &lt;a href=\"Tribunal%20Temple\"&gt;Tribunal Temple&lt;/a&gt; and the subsequent political order of Morrowind suggest that Nerevar died of his wounds shortly after the battle. Others, particularly the Ashlander tradition, state the Nerevar was murdered by the Tribunal in the aftermath of the battle.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Disappearance%20of%20the%20Dwarves\"&gt;disappearance of the Dwemer&lt;/a&gt; was caused by the events that happened in this chamber. This was either from the Tribunal using &lt;a href=\"Kagrenac%27s%20Tools\"&gt;Kagrenac's Tools&lt;/a&gt; on the Heart of Lorkhan guided by &lt;a href=\"Azura\"&gt;Azura&lt;/a&gt;, or when Kagrenac turned the Tools on the Heart himself during the battle.\nAftermath.\nEither directly following the battle, or some years after, the Tribunal use Kagrenac's Tools on the Heart of Lorkhan to tap its power and make themselves gods. Azura curses them for blasphemy, turning the golden-skinned Chimer into the grey-skinned &lt;a href=\"Dunmer\"&gt;Dunmer&lt;/a&gt;, and prophesying Nerevar's return.\nHouse Dagoth are defeated along with the Dwemer, with some sources claiming they were exterminated. There may have been some remnants of the House that were adopted into the other Great Houses."}

Meanwhile, the main bulk of his forces approached from the rear, gaining entrance to the fortress through a secret passage in the unscalable rear, revealed by a turncoat. This turncoat is traditionally a Breton sorcerer. The now undermanned fortress was then taken by Talos' forces, who captured the generals within the fortress and compelled the surrender of the Nord-Breton forces engaged in the sortie. The &lt;a href=\"Blades\"&gt;Blades&lt;/a&gt; also played a role in Tiber Septim's victory at Sancre Tor, to honor this role, Tiber Septim gave the &lt;a href=\"Armor%20of%20Tiber%20Septim\"&gt;Armor of Tiber Septim&lt;/a&gt; to the Blades.\nAftermath.\nThe Nord captives swore allegiance to Talos after the battle, and played a key role in Tiber's campaigns to unite &lt;a href=\"Cyrodiil\"&gt;Cyrodiil&lt;/a&gt;. The Breton Battlemage command was summarily executed. Talos recovered the Amulet of Kings from the tomb of Reman III in the catacombs beneath Sancre Tor immediately after the battle. Tiber Septim also received the blessing of Akatosh inside the catacombs.\nSome sources claim this attack damaged the fortress so badly it had to be abandoned, while others say that it was abandoned some time after the battle due to its poor strategic value. However, the truth appears to be that the citadel was cursed by the &lt;a href=\"Underking\"&gt;Underking&lt;/a&gt;, causing it to be sealed by the Grandmaster of the &lt;a href=\"Blades\"&gt;Blades&lt;/a&gt; some decades after the battle.\nIn memory of the people who died during the battle, a statue was built in &lt;a href=\"Chorrol\"&gt;Chorrol&lt;/a&gt;, named the \"Saint of Sancre Tor.\""}

Making their headquarters for the winter at &lt;a href=\"Sancre%20Tor\"&gt;Sancre Tor&lt;/a&gt;, the Nord-Breton allies dared King &lt;a href=\"Cuhlecain\"&gt;Cuhlecain&lt;/a&gt;'s new general, &lt;a href=\"Talos\"&gt;Talos&lt;/a&gt;, to assault them in their mountain fastnesses.\nWhen they learned that General Talos had mustered an army in the dead of winter and was marching to assault Sancre Tor, they were elated. Sancre Tor was impregnable, its citadel on high cliffs overlooking the lower city, nestled in a high mountain basin with steep, unscalable cliffs in their rear.\nThe Cyrodilic army was small, poorly trained and outfitted, short on rations, and unprepared for winter campaigning. As their ragged units assembled in the lowlands beneath the citadel, the Nord-Breton allies confidently assumed that their enemy had delivered himself into their trap.\nThe citadel was not only protected by an unscalable cliff in front and unscalable heights in their rear, but the entrance to the citadel was &lt;a href=\"magic\"&gt;magic&lt;/a&gt;ally concealed under the appearance of a large mountain lake in the basin beneath the heights. Accordingly, the Nord-Breton allies left on a small force to defend the citadel, descending through lower passages to attack and overwhelm the cold, hungry Cyrodilic forces before them. They expected to defeat, overrun, and annihilate General Talos' army, leaving no one to oppose their springtime descent into the Cyrodilic Heartlands.\nThus did General Talos lure the Nord-Breton allies to their doom.\nLeaving a weak force in the lowlands to draw out the defenders, General Talos approached the citadel of Sancre Tor from the rear, descending the supposedly unscalable heights behind the citadel, and sneaking into the supposedly magically concealed entrance to the inner citadel. This remarkable feat is attributed to the agency of a single unnamed traitor, by tradition a Breton turncoat sorcerer, who revealed both the existence of an obscure mountain trail down the heights behind the citadel and the secret of the citadel entrance concealed beneath its illusory lake surface.\nWhile the Cyrodilic army in the lowlands fought a desperate defense against the Nord-Breton sortie, General Talos and his men entered the citadel, swept aside the sparse defense, captured the Nord-Breton nobles and generals, and compelled them to surrender the citadel and their armies. The confused and demoralized Nord captives, already suspicious of the scheming &lt;a href=\"High%20Rock\"&gt;High Rock&lt;/a&gt; sorcerer aristocracy and their overreaching dreams of Heartlands conquests, deserted the alliance and swore loyalty to &lt;a href=\"Tiber%20Septim\"&gt;Tiber Septim&lt;/a&gt;. The Skyrim generals joined their rank and file in Tiber Septim's army; the High Rock &lt;a href=\"battlemage\"&gt;battlemage&lt;/a&gt; command was summarily executed and the captive Bretons imprisoned or sold into slavery.\nThus was the concerted allied invasion of Cyrodiil foiled, and General Talos' army swelled by the hardened Nord veteran troops that played so crucial a role in General Talos' succeeding campaigns which consolidated the &lt;a href=\"Colovian\"&gt;Colovian&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Nibenean\"&gt;Nibenean&lt;/a&gt; into the core of the Cyrodilic Empire, and which resulting in the crowning of General Talos as Emperor Tiber Septim.\nHistorians marvel at Tiber Septim's tactical daring in assaulting a fortified mountain citadel in the dead of winter against vastly superior numbers. Later Tiber Septim attributed his unwavering resolve against overwhelming obstacles to have been inspired by his divine vision of the &lt;a href=\"Amulet%20of%20Kings\"&gt;Amulet of Kings&lt;/a&gt; in the Tomb of &lt;a href=\"Reman%20III\"&gt;Reman III&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe young Talos may indeed have been inspired by his belief that he was fated to recover this ancient sacred symbol of the Covenant and to lead Tamriel to the high civilization of the Third Empire. Nonetheless, this should in no way reduce our admiration for the dash and genius of this defining military triumph against impossible odds."}

Soon after, Jorunn's army arrived from the west and struck the\u00a0rear of\u00a0Dir-Kamal's army. The Akaviri force was vast, however, and the fate of the battle hung in the balance.\nIt was then that Heita-Meen and her Argonians arrived from the south. The Dunmer were terrified at first, thinking that they had come to aid the invaders, but quickly realized their error as the Argonians attacked the Akaviri instead. Surrounded on three sides,\u00a0Dir-Kamal was forced back towards the sea.

In , reference to this battle can be found in the book \"&lt;a href=\"The%20Great%20War%20%28Book%29\"&gt;The Great War&lt;/a&gt;\".\nFactions.\nThe battle was fought by the forces of the &lt;a href=\"Aldmeri%20Dominion%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Aldmeri Dominion&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Septim%20Empire\"&gt;Tamrielic Empire&lt;/a&gt;. The defending forces were led by &lt;a href=\"Lord%20Naarifin\"&gt;Lord Naarifin&lt;/a&gt;, while the assaulting Generals were &lt;a href=\"General%20Decianus\"&gt;Decianus&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"General%20Jonna\"&gt;Jonna&lt;/a&gt;, and an &lt;a href=\"Forgotten%20Hero\"&gt;unknown hero&lt;/a&gt; disguised as &lt;a href=\"Emperor\"&gt;Emperor&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"Tamriel\"&gt;Tamriel&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Titus%20Mede%20II\"&gt;Titus Mede II&lt;/a&gt;.\nHistory.\nThe Battle of the Red Ring is named after the &lt;a href=\"Red%20Ring%20Road\"&gt;Red Ring Road&lt;/a&gt; which encircles the &lt;a href=\"Imperial%20City\"&gt;Imperial City&lt;/a&gt;. The result of the battle was the reconquering of the Imperial City, after it had fallen into the hands of the Aldmeri just one year prior. The battle has since become a point of discussion and reverence among Imperial war strategists.\nAfter \"The Sack of the Imperial City\" in &lt;a href=\"4E%20174\"&gt;4E 174&lt;/a&gt;, the Aldmeri Dominion believed the Empire's surrender to be inevitable, and close at hand. Emperor Titus II allowed this notion to continue unchallenged until &lt;a href=\"4E%20175\"&gt;4E 175&lt;/a&gt;, when he set in motion a plan to take back the Imperial City. The legions of General Decianus had been long on their return from &lt;a href=\"Hammerfell\"&gt;Hammerfell&lt;/a&gt;, and upon arrival, took cover in the &lt;a href=\"Colovian%20Highlands\"&gt;Colovian Highlands&lt;/a&gt; outside of &lt;a href=\"Chorrol\"&gt;Chorrol&lt;/a&gt;. Their presence remained undetected by the Aldmeri, and they initiated battle with a devastating surprise attack. Meanwhile, General Jonna led a garrison of mostly &lt;a href=\"Nord\"&gt;Nord&lt;/a&gt; soldiers to a rally point at &lt;a href=\"Cheydinhal\"&gt;Cheydinhal&lt;/a&gt;. They fought their way along Red Ring Road in an assault lasting two days, the plan being to join with the forces of Decianus while the Emperor planned to lead a third army in full assault from the north.\nHowever, shortly before the battle, the Emperor was wounded by a group of assassins, and was too weak to lead the attack. Realizing the importance of his presence at the battle, the Emperor charged an unknown hero with wearing his armor, leading the attack on the city, and defeating Lord Naarifin.\nDespite resistance from Aldmeri reinforcements from both &lt;a href=\"Bravil\"&gt;Bravil&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Skingrad\"&gt;Skingrad&lt;/a&gt;, Jonna's Nords succeeded in holding the road, while the forces of Titus II were free to drive into the city, and retake the capital, thus ending a battle that spanned five long days.\nThe battle effectively destroyed the main army of the Dominion in Cyrodiil.\nSpeculation.\nA few legends surround this battle. One is that Emperor Titus II wielded &lt;a href=\"Goldbrand\"&gt;Goldbrand&lt;/a&gt; during the battle. In reality, it was wielded by &lt;a href=\"Reive\"&gt;Reive&lt;/a&gt;, Naarifin's Daedric minion, and retrieved by &lt;a href=\"The%20Forgotten%20Hero\"&gt;The Forgotten Hero&lt;/a&gt; who used it in the battle.\nImportance.\nThis was the last significant battle of the Great War. Directly afterwards, the Empire signed the &lt;a href=\"White-Gold%20Concordat\"&gt;White-Gold Concordat&lt;/a&gt;, thus ending the war in the favor of the Aldmeri Dominion. Some take this battle as proof that the Empire could stand against the Dominion, and should have fought on, while others would argue that it greatly exhausted resources. Either way, it was instrumental to the outcome of the war."}

The stone walls are accessible via two sets of staircases opposite each other. The four towers on the corners of the courtyard are accessible, as are the gatehouse towers. Each of the towers has storage space inside.\nThe west portion of flat roof is accessible via the &lt;a href=\"Battlehorn%20Castle%23Battlehorn%20Castle%20Private%20Quarters\"&gt;Secret Vault&lt;/a&gt; in the private bedroom area next to the library.\nJust outside the gates, Southeast along the road, is a pond with a boat dock and a wooden boat. To the left of the dock is a &lt;a href=\"Nirnroot%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;Nirnroot&lt;/a&gt; and underwater beneath the boat is a treasure chest and a cluster of &lt;a href=\"clams%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;clams&lt;/a&gt;. Another cluster of clams can be found behind a rock further along in the pond.\nBattlehorn Castle Great Hall.\nThe Main entrance takes the Hero to the Great Hall Foyer. To the left is an entrance to the Northwest tower and the basement. The Knights of the True Horn's barracks and another basement entrance is to the left past the stairs, to the right before the stairs at the wall is their very own mini-altar (&lt;a href=\"Altar%20of%20Julianos\"&gt;Altar of Julianos&lt;/a&gt;) - if they visit the relevant &lt;a href=\"Wayshrines%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;wayshrine&lt;/a&gt; this will be activated, past the stairs is an entrance to the East Wing, and straight through is the Trophy Room.\nUp the stairs is another entrance to the east wing on the right, and an entrance to the Private Quarters on the left. A nirnroot grows on the Wolf's pedestal, hidden at the back behind the rock. On the second level, there is the \"&lt;a href=\"King\"&gt;King&lt;/a&gt;\" skill book on a table.\nBattlehorn Castle East Wing.\nThe east wing contains the Dining Room in the north section, and the &lt;a href=\"Melisi%20Daren\"&gt;Taxidermist's&lt;/a&gt; office in the south section.\nBattlehorn Castle Private Quarters.\nThe Private Quarters houses the bedroom, library, private dining area, office, and secret vault area. The bedroom contains a bed, a few drawers, tables, closet, and bookshelf. There are two skill books in the library on the shelf, \"&lt;a href=\"History%20of%20the%20Fighters%20Guild\"&gt;History of the Fighters Guild&lt;/a&gt;\" and \"&lt;a href=\"Heavy%20Armor%20Repair\"&gt;Heavy Armor Repair&lt;/a&gt;\". There are two more skill books on one of the dressers near the bed, \"&lt;a href=\"2920%2C%20vol%2001%20-%20Morning%20Star\"&gt;2920, vol 01 - Morning Star&lt;/a&gt;\" and \"&lt;a href=\"Warrior%20%28Book%29\"&gt;Warrior&lt;/a&gt;\".\nThe entrance to the secret room is on the south of the library nook, just pull the switch on the side of the depression in the wall, inside is storage containers, a trap door to the roof, and &lt;a href=\"Lord%20Jaren%27s%20Journal\"&gt;Lord Jaren's Journal&lt;/a&gt;.\nOnce all the of upgrades are purchased (including the &lt;a href=\"Dwemer%20Forge\"&gt;Dwemer Forge&lt;/a&gt;), &lt;a href=\"Lord%20Kelvyn%27s%20Bulwark\"&gt;Lord Kelvyn's Bulwark&lt;/a&gt; will spawn in a chest at the end of the bed.\nBattlehorn Castle Basement.\nThe basement has three entrances, two from the Great Hall and one from the East Wing. The Training Room, Kitchen, and Wine Cellar are all located on this level, along with a couple of small bedrooms and a hidden entrance to the Battlehorn Castle Grotto behind the archery range, one can access it by activating a candelabre. There is also a secret passage from the basement to the great hall through the wine cellar.\nBattlehorn Castle Grotto.\nThe Grotto, accessed from the training room in the basement, is the lowest level of the Castle. To find it, go to the room with the dummy used for archery. Go behind the dummy to the right side and activate the unlit candelabra. Inside are two hostile undead, &lt;a href=\"Kain\"&gt;Lord Kain&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Arielle%20Jurard%20%28Lich%29\"&gt;Arielle Jurard&lt;/a&gt;-a &lt;a href=\"skeleton%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;skeleton&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"lich%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;lich&lt;/a&gt;, respectively.\nFor more details on the two, see &lt;a href=\"Battlehorn%20Castle%20%28Quest%29\"&gt;Battlehorn Castle (Quest)&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Lord%20Jaren%27s%20Journal\"&gt;Lord Jaren's Journal&lt;/a&gt;. After defeating Arielle, loot a key from her corpse that unlocks a chest in the South-west side of the room submerged in water along the wall. One can also get a unique &lt;a href=\"Dragonsword\"&gt;enchanted sword&lt;/a&gt; from Kain along with an &lt;a href=\"Lord%20Kain%27s%20Shield\"&gt;enchanted shield&lt;/a&gt;.\nIf the Hero cast a spell while close enough to the giant crystal in the center of the room, it will glow more brightly for a brief time. If they cast a high level lightning spell like electrocution at it the effect lasts for a while and is quite striking.\u00a0There is yet to discover if this has any other benefits than looking nice. There are three &lt;a href=\"Varla%20Stone\"&gt;Varla Stone&lt;/a&gt;s in the grotto too."}

Using their skill in Blade, Blunt and Destruction magics they quickly dispatch any opposition, while alchemy allows the creation of strong potions to restore &lt;a href=\"health\"&gt;health&lt;/a&gt; or augment abilities, as well as powerful poisons to further shorten battles. Conjuration allows them to &lt;a href=\"summon\"&gt;summon&lt;/a&gt; powerful allies to cause even more damage to opponents, and to serve as protection in combat. Lacking &lt;a href=\"armor\"&gt;armor&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"shield\"&gt;shield&lt;/a&gt; skills, a Battlemage will need to either use summoned creatures to divert enemy attention away from themselves, or, like the &lt;a href=\"Witchhunter\"&gt;Witchhunter&lt;/a&gt;, use &lt;a href=\"Bound%20Armor\"&gt;bound armor&lt;/a&gt;. Summoning creatures may give the battlemage a chance to get around an enemy and attack from the rear.\nUsing magic rather than bows for ranged damage makes &lt;a href=\"arrows\"&gt;arrows&lt;/a&gt; irrelevant. One drawback of the class is that having both blunt and blade skills for melee can be considered overkill, while making a similar class using one or the other allows you to tag a more useful skill, rather than having an excess melee skill."}

He was a key figure in the &lt;a href=\"Oblivion%20Crisis\"&gt;Oblivion Crisis&lt;/a&gt; and a member of the guard set to protect to &lt;a href=\"Uriel%20Septim%20VII\"&gt;Uriel Septim VII&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"3E%20433\"&gt;3E 433&lt;/a&gt; during the assassination of the &lt;a href=\"Septim%20family\"&gt;Septim family&lt;/a&gt;. Though he failed to prevent the &lt;a href=\"Emperor\"&gt;Emperor&lt;/a&gt;'s death, Baurus would later gain a chance to rectify his failure when Uriel's last surviving heir, &lt;a href=\"Martin%20Septim%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;Martin Septim&lt;/a&gt;, was discovered. Working with the eponymous &lt;a href=\"Hero%20of%20Kvatch\"&gt;Hero of Kvatch&lt;/a&gt;, Baurus would uncover the identity of the &lt;a href=\"Mythic%20Dawn\"&gt;Order of the Mythic Dawn&lt;/a&gt;, and would fight alongside Martin and the Hero during the Battle of Bruma as well as the Battle of the Imperial City.\nBackground.\nEarly life.\nBaurus' origins are unknown. At some point, he joined the Blades, the Emperor's personal bodyguards. He was trained at &lt;a href=\"Cloud%20Ruler%20Temple%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;Cloud Ruler Temple&lt;/a&gt;, the fortress of the Blades, a place he came to know as home. In the later days of his service, he was appointed to the personal guard of Emperor Uriel Septim VII.\nUriel Septim VII's death.\nIn 3E 433, the Order of the Mythic Dawn began their assassination campaign on the royal family, a beginning to their plans to allow the &lt;a href=\"Daedra\"&gt;Daedra&lt;/a&gt; to invade &lt;a href=\"Tamriel\"&gt;Tamriel&lt;/a&gt;. After the deaths of the emperor's three sons, it was decided that Uriel should be placed under the immediate protection of the Blades. Baurus was a part of the group that would spirit the emperor away from the &lt;a href=\"Imperial%20City%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;Imperial City&lt;/a&gt;, along with fellow Blade &lt;a href=\"Glenroy\"&gt;Glenroy&lt;/a&gt; and led by &lt;a href=\"Captain%20Renault\"&gt;Captain Renault&lt;/a&gt;. They were to take a secret escape route through the &lt;a href=\"Imperial%20Prison\"&gt;Imperial Prison&lt;/a&gt; and out of the City and lead the emperor to Cloud Ruler Temple.\nIn the prison, the group encountered their first obstacle, but far from their greatest. The cell that housed the escape route was not empty, as it was supposed to be, but occupied by a prisoner. Renault and Glenroy deftly pushed the prisoner aside, but the emperor, having foreseen the events to come, recognized the prisoner as a key figure and bade him to accompany the group. As they proceeded, Baurus showed a trace more sympathy to the prisoner than his Blades counterparts, but remained detached from the individual's fate.\nThe attempt at secretly orchestrating the emperor's escape had failed, though. In the passage, they were ambushed by Mythic Dawn assassins in a series of skirmishes, during which Captain Renault was killed and Glenroy took point. For a time they were split from the prisoner, but when he appeared again, the emperor, in a clear expression of trust, ordered that he not be killed, despite Glenroy's belief that the prisoner might be an assassin. In light of this, Baurus was lighter and more open with the prisoner.\nThe group proceeded into the Sanctum, which housed the route to the sewers and escape. There, they were trapped and ambushed once again by the Mythic Dawn. Leaving the emperor under the prisoner's protection, Baurus and Glenroy went to fight off the assassins. Glenroy and Baurus succeeded in killing off the would-be killers (however, sometimes Glenroy may also be killed). But it amounted to little; as the Blades had been occupied fighting off the Mythic Dawn, an assassin had entered through a secret way and killed the emperor before the prisoner could prevent it.\nBaurus, upon seeing the Emperor's dead body, was devastated. He swiftly noticed, however, that the &lt;a href=\"Amulet%20of%20Kings%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;Amulet of Kings&lt;/a&gt; was not present on Uriel's body. The prisoner, possessing the Amulet, explained that the emperor had given it to him, and told him to take it to &lt;a href=\"Jauffre%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;Jauffre&lt;/a&gt; and find the remaining heir. If Baurus was skeptical of this, he did not show it, placing faith in the trust the emperor had shown in the prisoner. Baurus promptly informed the prisoner where to find Jauffre, the Grandmaster of the Blades, and gave the prisoner the key to leave the sewers. Baurus himself stayed behind to guard the emperor's body and the prisoner's route.\nThe Mythic Dawn.\nBaurus presumably met with the Imperial Watch following the emperor's murder, leaving the cleanup in the Sanctum to them. Baurus immediately began tracking down leads on the assassins, succeeding where the Watch failed in discovering the identity of the Mythic Dawn cult. After he relayed this information to Cloud Ruler Temple, Baurus was sent assistance in his hunt\u2014none other than the prisoner. Following the events in the prison, the prisoner had delivered the Amulet to Jauffre and found the emperor's illegitimate heir, Martin Septim. Shortly after the &lt;a href=\"Battle%20of%20Kvatch\"&gt;Battle of Kvatch&lt;/a&gt;, the official start of the &lt;a href=\"Oblivion%20Crisis\"&gt;Oblivion Crisis&lt;/a&gt;, the Hero met Baurus at &lt;a href=\"Luther%20Broad%27s%20Boarding%20House\"&gt;Luther Broad's Boarding House&lt;/a&gt; in the Imperial City. By this time, the Mythic Dawn had realized Baurus was tracking them, and had in turn set their own agent, &lt;a href=\"Astav%20Wirich\"&gt;Astav Wirich&lt;/a&gt;, to track him.\nUpon the Hero's arrival, Baurus, knowing that Wirich would follow, ordered the Hero to trail them both into the basement of Luther Broad's. The Hero did so, and the two of them summarily defeated Wirich. The Hero then informed Baurus of all that had taken place prior to their meeting, including the loss of the Amulet of Kings to the Mythic Dawn. Though Baurus was worried by this news, he was overjoyed to hear that Martin was alive, swearing to bring him to the throne. From the body of the Dawn agent, they recovered the first book of the \"&lt;a href=\"Commentaries%20on%20the%20Mysterium%20Xarxes\"&gt;Commentaries on the Mysterium Xarxes&lt;/a&gt;\", the secret writings of the cult. Baurus recognized this as a lead, and informed the Hero that a scholar at the &lt;a href=\"Arcane%20University%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;Arcane University&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Tar-Meena\"&gt;Tar-Meena&lt;/a&gt;, would be able to shed more light on the Daedric cult.\nThe Hero went on to investigate, while Baurus returned to Luther Broad's. A short while later, the Hero returned, now in possession of two more volumes of the \"Commentaries\", as well as a way to obtain the fourth and final volume in a meeting with a Mythic Dawn recruiter. Baurus, who knew the route through the sewers to the meeting place, led the Hero there. The two of them together took on Mythic Dawn lieutenant, &lt;a href=\"Raven%20Camoran\"&gt;Raven Camoran&lt;/a&gt;, and two agents in a &lt;a href=\"Skirmish%20in%20the%20Sewers\"&gt;quick skirmish&lt;/a&gt;, killing all three and recovering the final book. After this, Baurus left the Hero to continue the investigation into the Mythic Dawn's location, while he himself returned to Cloud Ruler Temple.\nGuarding Martin.\nUpon returning to the Temple, Baurus immediately took up a post as Martin Septim's personal bodyguard, never leaving the heir's side. Feeling remorse for having let Uriel Septim die under his watch, Baurus dedicated himself to keeping Martin alive. He would be present for all the meetings between Martin and the Hero, who eventually returned to Cloud Ruler after having successfully raided the Mythic Dawn's secret shrine to their Daedra Lord, &lt;a href=\"Mehrunes%20Dagon\"&gt;Mehrunes Dagon&lt;/a&gt;, whose &lt;a href=\"Daedra\"&gt;Daedra&lt;/a&gt; were now attacking all of Tamriel due to the Dawn's emptying of the Imperial throne. The Hero failed to recover the Amulet of Kings, which was taken by Mythic Dawn leader &lt;a href=\"Mankar%20Camoran%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;Mankar Camoran&lt;/a&gt;, but did retrieve the \"&lt;a href=\"Mysterium%20Xarxes\"&gt;Mysterium Xarxes&lt;/a&gt;\" itself, which would allow Martin to open a portal to Camoran's otherworldly Paradise.\nIn gratitude for the Hero's aid in the Imperial City, Baurus taught the Hero a series of Blades fighting techniques during their time at Cloud Ruler Temple. Over time, the Hero was successful in recovering all the items necessary for Martin's Paradise ritual. The final item however, a &lt;a href=\"Great%20Sigil%20Stone%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;Great Sigil Stone&lt;/a&gt;, required a major risk\u2014the opening of a &lt;a href=\"Great%20Oblivion%20Gate\"&gt;Great Oblivion Gate&lt;/a&gt; near the city of &lt;a href=\"Bruma%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;Bruma&lt;/a&gt;. The Mythic Dawn were already planning to open the Gate, and Martin himself was to lead the &lt;a href=\"Defense%20of%20Bruma%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;Defense of Bruma&lt;/a&gt;. Though both Jauffre and the Hero argued against this, Martin was firm in his determination, and thus so was Baurus in his resolve to protect the soon-to-be-emperor.\nFighting in the crisis.\nBaurus accompanied Martin, Jauffre, and the Hero to the War Council with Bruma Countess &lt;a href=\"Narina%20Carvain\"&gt;Narina Carvain&lt;/a&gt;, where the final plans were laid for the battle. Then Baurus, Martin, Jauffre, the Hero, and Guard Captain &lt;a href=\"Burd\"&gt;Burd&lt;/a&gt; led the army the Hero had assembled to the battlefield, where the first of the preliminary &lt;a href=\"Oblivion%20Gate%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;Oblivion Gates&lt;/a&gt; was already open. Baurus and Jauffre took up positions higher up on the dip, and Baurus watched as Martin gave a stirring speech to the assembled forces of &lt;a href=\"Cyrodiil\"&gt;Cyrodiil&lt;/a&gt;; then the first of the Daedra emerged from the Gate and the fight was on.\nThe Second Battle of Bruma was one of the largest conflicts of the Oblivion Crisis. Baurus, for his part, was one of the most impassioned fighters, slaying Daedra with a great ferocity, yet never straying too far from Martin. When the Great Gate at last opened, the Hero charged inside, intent upon reaching the Sigil Stone before the &lt;a href=\"Daedric%20Siege%20Crawler\"&gt;Daedric Siege Crawler&lt;/a&gt; could emerge to destroy Bruma, as it had &lt;a href=\"Kvatch%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;Kvatch&lt;/a&gt;. Baurus and the others held the line while the Hero traversed the plane of &lt;a href=\"Oblivion%20%28Realm%29\"&gt;Oblivion&lt;/a&gt; and breached the Daedric defenses, recovering the Stone and destroying the Great Gate, as well as the Siege Crawler, winning the battle.\nBaurus returned to Cloud Ruler Temple along with Martin and Jauffre, and was present to see Martin open the portal to Camoran's Paradise and to watch the Hero enter that realm; Baurus felt a bit of resentment that he could not be there as well, bringing about the end of the Mythic Dawn. While the Hero fought Mankar Camoran at the seat of his power, Martin sent Baurus to the Imperial City to inform &lt;a href=\"High%20Chancellor\"&gt;High Chancellor&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Ocato\"&gt;Ocato&lt;/a&gt; of events, as well as Martin's claim to the throne. Baurus met up with Martin, Jauffre, and the Hero when they arrived in the City, once again bearing the Amulet of Kings. Baurus remained outside the Palace as Martin met with Ocato, and thus he was one of the first to encounter the Daedra as they launched their assault on the Imperial City, one final gambit to stop Martin from ascending to the throne and lighting the mystical Dragonfires, sealing the Gates of Oblivion.\nBaurus fought to keep Martin alive during the Battle of the Imperial City, going with him from the Palace District to the Temple District, where the Imperial forces came in contact with their greatest foe to date\u2014Mehrunes Dagon himself. The &lt;a href=\"Daedric%20Prince\"&gt;Daedric Prince&lt;/a&gt; of Destruction's appearance was an indication that the barriers between Tamriel and Oblivion were now entirely gone, and that lighting the Dragonfires would do nothing now. Martin and the Hero pressed on anyway, and Baurus watched as they entered the Temple of the One\u2014and marveled as, moments later, a vast flaming dragon burst from the Temple to battle Dagon one-on-one. In that great duel, the Daedra Lord was defeated and cast back into Oblivion, ending the Oblivion Crisis; the great dragon turned to stone. Shortly after this, Baurus learned that the dragon had been Martin, giving his life to stop Dagon and the Daedra.\nAfter the Crisis.\nBaurus, although Martin had died, was glad to have served him, calling him one of the greatest emperors the Blades had ever protected. Baurus also paid tribute to the Hero of Kvatch, who had witnessed firsthand the duel between the two titans, and who was now to be proclaimed the &lt;a href=\"Champion%20of%20Cyrodiil\"&gt;Champion of Cyrodiil&lt;/a&gt; due to their service as Martin's own champion. Baurus congratulated the Hero, marveling at how their adventure had started with sending an escapee off with the Amulet of Kings. After the battle, Baurus returned to Cloud Ruler Temple. His fate following these events is unknown.\nPersonality.\nBaurus was an extremely loyal Blade, serving the Emperors with a fierce dedication. The death of Uriel was a severe blow to him, and he felt greatly that he had failed in his duty, in some ways blaming himself alone. He saw Martin as a chance to redeem himself, and thus swore to protect Martin at all costs. In that time, Baurus came to regard Martin even more highly than he had the man's father. Where he had expressed immense sorrow at Uriel's passing, he was joyous after Martin's, feeling honored to have served so great a master.\nDue to their role in the Emperor's death, Baurus had a deep-seated hatred of the Mythic Dawn. He expressed satisfaction at any misfortune that befell them. While he never shirked his duty, Baurus did express regret at not being able to pursue them along with the Hero, and he congratulated the Hero after &lt;a href=\"Mankar%20Camoran%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;Mankar Camoran's&lt;/a&gt; death, saying that he wished he could have been there as well. In terms of the Hero, Baurus felt a great friendship with them, teaching them fighting moves as well as expressing honor to have fought beside them. By the end of the &lt;a href=\"Oblivion%20Crisis\"&gt;Oblivion Crisis&lt;/a&gt;, the two were extremely comfortable with each other, and astonished at how their relationship had begun.\nBaurus was a skilled Blade, both with his &lt;a href=\"Akaviri%20Katana\"&gt;Akaviri Katana&lt;/a&gt; and, to some degree, &lt;a href=\"magic\"&gt;magic&lt;/a&gt;, as he often employed a healing spell in battle.\nInteractions.\n&lt;a href=\"Tutorial%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;Tutorial&lt;/a&gt;.\nBaurus is among the Blades escorting Uriel Septim VII and will instruct the Hero of Kvatch not to follow them after encountering the first group assassins. When the Hero regroups with the Emperor and his Blades, Baurus will give them a torch if they do not have one equipped.\n&lt;a href=\"Deliver%20the%20Amulet\"&gt;Deliver the Amulet&lt;/a&gt;.\nAfter the Emperor is assassinated, Baurus will instruct the Hero to leave the sewers and make for Weynon Priory with the Amulet of Kings while he guards the Emperor's body and ensures they are not followed.\n&lt;a href=\"The%20Path%20of%20Dawn\"&gt;The Path of Dawn&lt;/a&gt;.\nBaurus assists the Hero in tracking down leads on the Mythic Dawn, directing them to Tar Meena and the Commentaries on the Mysterium Xarxes. After retriving the third volume, Baurus accompanies the Hero into the sewers to attend a meeting with \"the Sponsor.\" During the meeting and at all points after, it is possible for Baurus to die. If he survives, he will return to Cloud Ruler Temple to guard Martin Septim. \n&lt;a href=\"Defense%20of%20Bruma%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;Defense of Bruma&lt;/a&gt;.\nBaurus will accompany Martin to Bruma and then to the battlefield where he will fight against the Daedra. Due to the many enemies present, Baurus can easily die before or during the assault on the Great Gate. If he survived, he will return to Cloud Ruler Temple to resume guarding Martin.\n&lt;a href=\"Light%20the%20Dragonfires\"&gt;Light the Dragonfires&lt;/a&gt;.\nIf Baurus is alive, he will be present in Green Emperor Way before the Imperial Palace, having informed the Elder Council of Marin's impending arrival. When Martin arrives, Baurus will greet him and remain outside the Palace. As the attack against the city begins, Baurus will be among the guards fighting the Daedra outside. He he then will accompany Martin to the Temple District and fight against the Daedra there. If Baurus survived, he will return to Cloud Ruler Temple.\nConversations.\nRenault: \"Baurus!

Don't worry, sire, we will get you out of here.\"\nGlenroy: \"They won't be the first to underestimate the Blades. I'll take point. let's move.\"\nBaurus: \"You stay here, prisoner. Don't try to follow us.\"\nWhen the Hero finds the Emperor again:\nGlenroy: \"We should find a defensible spot and protect the Emperor until help arrives.\"\nBaurus: \"Help? What makes you help will get here before more of those bastards? We need to get the Emperor out of here.\"\nGlenroy: \"Here they come again!\"\nAfter the fight:\nBaurus: \"I think that was all of them. Let me take a look around.\"\nUriel Septim: \"Have you seen the prisoner?\"\nGlenroy: \"Do you think he followed us? How could he?\"\nAfter Baurus walked around the room:\nGlenroy: \"Sire, we have to go now.\"\nUriel Septim: \"Not yet.

What's your call, sir?\"\nGlenroy: \"I don't know. I don't see any good options here.\"\nWhen the first gate closes:\nGlenroy: \"They're behind us!

It's hard to make out their intentions, but the research materials scattered around the place suggest an extensive team of mages who required vast amounts of thermoharmonic power for their purposes. We've collected everything we could for later study.\nDorand is losing it. One minute he's arguing with Glurbasha about pressing on, the next he's jumping at the smallest sound. He keeps saying the ruin is alive. That the walls are watching us. He needs to get some sleep.\nDay 4\nSeparated from Dorand and the others after the pale Orcs attacked. Leaves me in charge of two mercenaries. I don't even know their names, but they answer to \"you.\" Good enough for me.\nI told them about the thermoharmonic valve we saw on the way here and ordered them to close it. The pressure seals the door, just like Dorand said. Release the valve, the door opens. I'll wait by the door until they release the valve. Once inside I'll see if I can find out why all this pressure is directed into one room.\nDay 5\nIt wasn't enough. The door lost pressure, but it still wouldn't budge. An hour later the pressure restored itself. The mercenaries never returned. Did they run? Were they killed?\nThe constructs are watching me now. Coming closer.

Drastically different, culturally and physiologically, from &lt;a href=\"men\"&gt;men&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"mer\"&gt;mer&lt;/a&gt;, the Beastfolk possess different skeletal structures and metabolic processes (even amongst themselves). While rumors of interbreeding between beastfolk and other races exist, none have been proven.\nBeastfolk come in a variety of colors and body structures, and are not sub-species of the same proto-race like men and mer. Included in this category are the &lt;a href=\"Khajiit\"&gt;Khajiit&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Argonians\"&gt;Argonians&lt;/a&gt;.\nOrigins.\n&lt;a href=\"Vvardenfell\"&gt;Vvardenfell&lt;/a&gt; savant &lt;a href=\"Okan-Shei\"&gt;Okan-Shei&lt;/a&gt; professed that Betmeri, or \"Beastmen,\" were the aboriginal inhabitants of &lt;a href=\"Tamriel\"&gt;Tamriel&lt;/a&gt;. Each bestial race reports differently in &lt;a href=\"Mythic%20Era\"&gt;Mythic Era&lt;/a&gt; history, before the Invasions of men and mer.\nThe origins of beastfolk, unlike mer and men, vary from race to race. Though the beastfolk were the first inhabitants of Tamriel, they did not create written records until the empire of &lt;a href=\"Tiber%20Septim\"&gt;Tiber Septim&lt;/a&gt;, making it difficult to determine how long Beastmen were in Tamriel before the first mer.\nPhysiology.\nThe most significant difference between the beastfolk and the other races is physical, with far more differences than those between men and mer. The races of beastfolk are also far more different from one another than any two races of men or mer. The physical appearance of beastfolk range from being humanoid in appearance to more beast-like.\nNo official information has been released about the lifespans of beastfolk. The immortal beings known as &lt;a href=\"Dragons%20%28Lore%29\"&gt;dragons&lt;/a&gt;, not unlike beastfolk but considered 'mere beasts' by most people, are in reality highly intelligent creatures of divine origin, unrelated to the bestial races.\nTamrielic bestial races.\nArgonians.\nThe Argonians are a race of reptilian creatures native to &lt;a href=\"Black%20Marsh\"&gt;Black Marsh&lt;/a&gt;. They are highly resistant to &lt;a href=\"disease\"&gt;disease&lt;/a&gt; and can &lt;a href=\"Waterbreathing\"&gt;breathe underwater&lt;/a&gt;, as well as the only race of Tamriel that are completely unrelated to men and mer, having descended from a race of sentient trees known as &lt;a href=\"Hist\"&gt;Hist&lt;/a&gt;. Argonians possess tails, the only playable race besides the Khajiit to do so. When swimming, they use their tails to propel themselves as they glide through the water. Both male and female Argonians exhibit sexual qualities similar to men and mer, but no well-documented cross-breed offspring have been discovered, possibly because Argonians are egg-layers.\nDreugh.\nThe Dreugh or Dreughs are a race of powerful aquatic creatures observed primarily in &lt;a href=\"Morrowind\"&gt;Morrowind&lt;/a&gt; (especially the &lt;a href=\"Inner%20Sea\"&gt;Inner Sea&lt;/a&gt;), the &lt;a href=\"Illiac%20Bay\"&gt;Illiac Bay&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"Abecean%20Sea\"&gt;Abecean Sea&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Black%20Marsh\"&gt;Black Marsh&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Cyrodiil\"&gt;Cyrodiil&lt;/a&gt;. They are often hunted for their &lt;a href=\"Dreugh%20Wax\"&gt;wax&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Dreugh%20Armor\"&gt;hide&lt;/a&gt;.\nOnce common throughout &lt;a href=\"Vvardenfell\"&gt;Vvardenfell&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Ebonheart\"&gt;Ebonheart&lt;/a&gt;, and the surrounding waters, they have been driven into isolated pockets in more recent times. There is some doubt on whether they shouldn't be classified along with &lt;a href=\"Argonians\"&gt;Argonians&lt;/a&gt;, for their semi-aquatic nature and \"troglophiliac\" &lt;a href=\"human\"&gt;human&lt;/a&gt;oid form.\nAccording to legend, the Dreugh devolved from a much more intelligent and civilized race due to conflict with the &lt;a href=\"Dunmer\"&gt;Dunmer&lt;/a&gt; (who used their hides and wax), and powerful, tyrannic Dreugh kingdoms are reported by &lt;a href=\"Mankar%20Camoran\"&gt;Mankar Camoran&lt;/a&gt; in his &lt;a href=\"Mythic%20Dawn%20Commentaries\"&gt;Mythic Dawn Commentaries&lt;/a&gt;, even going as far as to state they once ruled the world. That notion is explored in &lt;a href=\"Vivec\"&gt;Vivec&lt;/a&gt;'s lessons, where it is stated that, \"when the dreughs ruled the world, the &lt;a href=\"Daedroth\"&gt;Daedroth&lt;/a&gt; Prince &lt;a href=\"Molag%20Bal\"&gt;Molag Bal&lt;/a&gt; had been their chief.\" The sermon gives details of the form Bal took at the time, describing it as \"spiny and armored and made for the sea.\"\nGiants.\nGiants are a race of gargantuan humanoids found in the wilderness of &lt;a href=\"Skyrim\"&gt;Skyrim&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"High%20Rock\"&gt;High Rock&lt;/a&gt;. Infamous for their colossal height and immense strength, giants share little civil interaction with humanoids, if in fact any. Culturally, giants herd &lt;a href=\"Mammoth\"&gt;Mammoth&lt;/a&gt;s, processing their milk into cheese, and complementing their omnivorous diet with the cooked meat of &lt;a href=\"skeever\"&gt;skeever&lt;/a&gt;. Seemingly nomadic, giants travel with their herds, setting up camps across Skyrim and High Rock. Invaders are attacked with the massive clubs forged by the giants that look like they have been made out of tree trunks and large rocks. Their physical similarities with &lt;a href=\"Orc\"&gt;Orc&lt;/a&gt;s\u2014jutting lower canines, tapered ears and the presence of stumpy horns on the temples (much diminished in giants)\u2014serve as possible evidence of some loose relation to the mer.\nGoblins.\nGoblins are small but tough two-legged creatures found in &lt;a href=\"Cyrodiil\"&gt;Cyrodiil&lt;/a&gt;. They are a bit shorter in size than the average mer. Goblins have blue or green-hued skin, and bulbous eyes. Most goblins are part of a goblin clan that congregates around a certain location, particularly &lt;a href=\"Caves%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;caves&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Mines%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;mines&lt;/a&gt;, but also may be found living in sewers or various ruins. They are thought to be extinct since the &lt;a href=\"Third%20Era\"&gt;Third Era&lt;/a&gt;. It has been suggested that Goblins are not sentient. This is not necessarily true, however, as there is much evidence of animal domestication and social structure with ranks among those in a particular group.\nHist.\nRelatively little is known about the Hist. They are sentient trees that are native to Black Marsh. It is also believed that Hist trees are intelligent and have a conscience, and their roots are buried in the \"soft white stone of the marsh.\" The Hist are thought to share a mind or have a hive mind ability. Though they share a mind, it is possible for one to \"go rogue\" and \"escape itself.\" In such instances, the Hist purge the rogue tree. This last happened to a tree in Lilmoth over 300 years ago. The current Lilmoth Hist grows from part of its root.\nImga.\nThe Great Apes, or Imga, reside in the province of &lt;a href=\"Valenwood\"&gt;Valenwood&lt;/a&gt; and idolize the Altmer of the &lt;a href=\"Summerset%20Isles\"&gt;Summerset Isles&lt;/a&gt;, with some going so far as to shave themselves and powder their skin so as to better emulate their appearance.\nKhajiit.\nThe Khajiit are a feline race native to &lt;a href=\"Elsweyr\"&gt;Elsweyr&lt;/a&gt;, with superb inherent nocturnal vision and pointed ears that have led some to believe their phylum contains mer blood. The \"breed\" of each Khajiit is determined by the position of the moon during their birth; there are supposedly more than 20 breeds of Khajiit, but only 17 have been verified. The most common breed is the &lt;a href=\"Cathay\"&gt;Cathay&lt;/a&gt;. Khajiit are known for their natural agility, stealth and fondness for &lt;a href=\"Moon%20Sugar\"&gt;Moon Sugar&lt;/a&gt;/&lt;a href=\"Skooma\"&gt;Skooma&lt;/a&gt;. Khajiit typically refer to themselves in the third person, unless provoked by a hostile.\nLamias.\nLamias (singular: Lamia) are semi-aquatic, exclusively female, serpentine creatures, having the torso of a humanoid, while boasting the lower body and head of a snake. Generally, savage and hostile to most other races (although there have been exceptions), Lamias can typically be found dwelling in swamps all over Tamriel. Despite their feral nature, Lamias are capable of speech, as well as spell casting and can to perform some basic cultural and religious practices. \nLilmothiit.\nThe Lilmothiit are a fox-like beast race who once inhabited the &lt;a href=\"Black%20Marsh\"&gt;Black Marsh&lt;/a&gt;. They were a tribal race and they may have been related to &lt;a href=\"Khajiit\"&gt;Khajiit&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"Elsweyr\"&gt;Elsweyr&lt;/a&gt;.\nMinotaur.\nMinotaurs, also known as Man-bulls or Bull-men, are a race of beastfolk native to Cyrodiil, identified as having the body of a Man and the head of a &lt;a href=\"bull\"&gt;bull&lt;/a&gt;. Always a target of suspicion and fear because of their size and strength, they were redefined by the &lt;a href=\"Alessian%20Order\"&gt;Alessian Order&lt;/a&gt; as \"monsters\" during the early and middle &lt;a href=\"First%20Era\"&gt;First Era&lt;/a&gt;, and classed alongside creatures such as &lt;a href=\"Ogre\"&gt;Ogre&lt;/a&gt;s and &lt;a href=\"Troll\"&gt;Troll&lt;/a&gt;s. They were driven into the hills and forests, and their previous culture was lost.\nNymphs.\nNymphs are a mysterious and rare race that resides on the continent of Tamriel. Little is known of them, although all of the observed members of the species seem to be female and are described as beautiful naked women. There is a rumour spread among the common folk and even scholars that they like to have indiscriminate sex, although the only scholar to study this claim considers it a misconception.\nRiekling.\nRieklings are small goblin-like creatures found on the island of &lt;a href=\"Solstheim%20%28Dragonborn%29\"&gt;Solstheim&lt;/a&gt;. They tend to live in small tribes in caves, ancient ruins and even mountain peaks. They are hostile in nature, but individually pose little threat. They typically rely on strength in numbers and a small group can quickly overwhelm an enemy. Riekling settlements give insight into their level of intelligence, which corresponds roughly to a stone age society: they have developed simple tool-crafting and elements of rudimentary language and religion, and have domesticated &lt;a href=\"Bristleback\"&gt;Bristleback&lt;/a&gt;, which they raise for food and use as mounts. Characteristics of Riekling religion include the \"Godspeak Song\" and the construction of shrines, but there does not appear to be any shamans or other religious leaders. At least one Riekling is known to have learned to speak intelligently.\nOther beast races.\nSload.\nFor millennia, these hulking, slug-like creatures, notorious for their necromantic mastery, terrorized the &lt;a href=\"Altmer\"&gt;Altmer&lt;/a&gt;, conjuring sea monsters along the coast and laying siege to &lt;a href=\"Skywatch\"&gt;Skywatch&lt;/a&gt;. They are said to operate &lt;a href=\"airships\"&gt;airships&lt;/a&gt;, and to live on the semi-submerged continent of &lt;a href=\"Thras\"&gt;Thras&lt;/a&gt;. It is unknown exactly how Sload reproduce. Adult Sload have never been seen to involve themselves in such things, and seemingly have no interest in the fate of the young. Sload begin their lives as \"disgusting little amorphous grubs.\" As they age, these grow into a purely aquatic stage that is described as \"soft,\" \"squishy,\" and \"octopus-like.\" Upon reaching adulthood the Sload becomes amphibious and have an appearance similar to a large slug.\nDragon.\nDragons (or Dovah; \"Dov\" refers to Dragons as a race) are a reptilian &lt;a href=\"race\"&gt;race&lt;/a&gt; originally native to &lt;a href=\"Akavir\"&gt;Akavir&lt;/a&gt; that were once widespread throughout &lt;a href=\"Tamriel\"&gt;Tamriel&lt;/a&gt;. Despite their bestial appearance, they are known as much for their intelligence and wisdom as they are for their raw, uncontrolled power. They possess &lt;a href=\"Dragon%20Language\"&gt;their own spoken and written language&lt;/a&gt;, and are capable of comprehending other languages. They, for the most part, consider non-Dovah to be weak-minded. Some words in their spoken language can be projected into a powerful magic known as the &lt;a href=\"Thu%27um\"&gt;Thu'um&lt;/a&gt; (literally means \"Storm Voice\") which is known to some simply as \"The Voice,\" but widely known as \"Shouts.\" They were nearly driven to extinction, and were widely believed to be until &lt;a href=\"4E%20201\"&gt;4E 201&lt;/a&gt; when they resurfaced in &lt;a href=\"Skyrim\"&gt;Skyrim&lt;/a&gt; with the return of &lt;a href=\"Alduin\"&gt;Alduin&lt;/a&gt;.\nTsaesci.\nEven though the Tsaesci are the best known of Akavir's inhabitants, very little is known about them, and much of it is contradictory or cryptic. Within the current lore of Tamriel, there are two quite different depictions of the Tsaesci. Some evidence seems to indicate that they are humans. Other evidence, however, paints a much stranger picture, as vampiric snake-like creatures that feed on humans. To date, there has not been sufficient evidence gathered to conclusively prove or disprove either, or both, of these depictions. Early depictions of the Tsaesci almost invariably describe them as having the upper body of a man but the lower body of a snake. The most direct evidence of these \"snake folk\" comes from \"&lt;a href=\"Mysterious%20Akavir\"&gt;Mysterious Akavir&lt;/a&gt;\", which claims that the vampire snakes of Tsaesci ate all of the humans that once lived on Akavir. The reputability of this book is frequently questioned, however, as few of its other claims have been independently verified.\nTang Mo.\nTang Mo means \"Thousand Monkey Isles\" in &lt;a href=\"Akaviri\"&gt;Akaviri&lt;/a&gt;. It is also the name that the inhabitants of this land use to refer to themselves. The Monkey People of Tang Mo are described as being -like. The Tang Mo have had to defend their nation over the eras from all of the other nations of &lt;a href=\"Akavir\"&gt;Akavir&lt;/a&gt;, specifically from the snow demons, \"&lt;a href=\"Kamal\"&gt;Kamal&lt;/a&gt;.\" It is believed that the Tang Mo have created an alliance with the &lt;a href=\"Ka%20Po%27%20Tun\"&gt;Ka Po' Tun&lt;/a&gt;.\nKa Po'Tun.\nThe Ka'Po'Tun are a race present on the continent of &lt;a href=\"Akavir\"&gt;Akavir&lt;/a&gt;. They are described as being tiger-like cat-folk, possibly similar in appearance to the &lt;a href=\"Khajiit\"&gt;Khajiit&lt;/a&gt;. They are led by the mighty &lt;a href=\"Tosh%20Raka\"&gt;Tosh Raka&lt;/a&gt;. Under his leadership the Po'Tun changed their species' name to the Ka'Po'Tun."}

Pariel begged Hircine to save them, and Hircine \"changed her.\" After helping her husband escape, Pariel disappeared into a cave beneath the Falinesti Spring Site.\"\nSummary.\nAt the &lt;a href=\"Falinesti%20Spring%20Site\"&gt;Falinesti Spring Site&lt;/a&gt;, the Vestige may discover &lt;a href=\"Thonoras\"&gt;Thonoras&lt;/a&gt;, who will tell them how his wife, &lt;a href=\"Pariel\"&gt;Pariel&lt;/a&gt;, broke the &lt;a href=\"Green%20Pact\"&gt;Green Pact&lt;/a&gt; by making a deal with the &lt;a href=\"Daedric%20Princes\"&gt;Daedric prince&lt;/a&gt;\u00a0&lt;a href=\"Hircine\"&gt;Hircine&lt;/a&gt;.\nWalkthrough.\nAt the &lt;a href=\"Falinesti%20Spring%20Site\"&gt;Falinesti Spring Site&lt;/a&gt;, you will find a man named Thonoras. Thonoras and his wife Pariel were recently captured by the Wood Orcs, but she broke the Green Pact and made a deal with Hircine to transform her into a beast and slaughter the Wood Orcs. The Green Pact now mandates that Thonoras now kills his wife, so he will ask you to subdue her. \nPariel is in the Falinesti Cave just beside where you meet Thonoras. Throughout the cave, you will find signs that something massive has just passed through. In the cave's southern passageway, you will also find the lorebook \"&lt;a href=\"Gifts%20of%20the%20Nereids\"&gt;Gifts of the Nereids&lt;/a&gt;\", so be sure to pick that up. In the center of the cave, you will find hints that the giant beast fell down, so you should pursue it to the floor below using the hanging vines here. To your east, you will find Pariel, who has taken the form of a bear. Beat her up a bit, and she will run off. When you give chase, Thonoras will show up; talk to him and he will tell you that he does not actually intend to kill Pariel; rather, he is going to break the Green Pact himself to join Pariel.\nAt this point, the Vestige will be given a choice once they have spoken to Thoronas after subduing Pariel. They\u00a0can either let him transform himself into a beast, just like Pariel, or they can persuade\u00a0him to not violate the &lt;a href=\"Green%20Pact\"&gt;Green Pact&lt;/a&gt;, and to kill her.\nEither way, head back to the cave entrance to collect your reward from Thoronas's backpack. This will finish the quest."}

{"id": "65626", "revid": "26213507", "url": "https://elderscrolls.fandom.com/wiki?curid=65626", "title": "Becoming Thane", "text": "Becoming Thane consists of a series of &lt;a href=\"Quests%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;quests&lt;/a&gt; in , in which the &lt;a href=\"Last%20Dragonborn\"&gt;Dragonborn&lt;/a&gt; can become a &lt;a href=\"Thane%20%28Title%29\"&gt;Thane&lt;/a&gt; of all the &lt;a href=\"holds\"&gt;holds&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Skyrim\"&gt;Skyrim&lt;/a&gt;. The standard formula for each hold is to complete a specific quest, or objective for the &lt;a href=\"Jarl\"&gt;Jarl&lt;/a&gt; and then help out a specific number of citizens within the hold, either by doing quests, miscellaneous objectives, or helping out in some other way. However, the number of citizens that need to be helped varies based on if the hold is a major one, which includes a palace for the Jarl to live in, or a minor one, where the Jarl lives in a longhouse.\nBecoming a Thane of a Hold carries several perks, including gaining a &lt;a href=\"housecarl\"&gt;housecarl&lt;/a&gt; if there is property in the hold, and the ability to demand that guards ignore minor crimes.\nMany of the potential quest giving citizens are at risk of death from &lt;a href=\"Dragons%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;dragon&lt;/a&gt; attacks, and &lt;a href=\"Vampire%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;vampire&lt;/a&gt; attacks if is installed. To completely avoid this, after talking to the &lt;a href=\"Balgruuf%20the%20Greater\"&gt;Jarl of Whiterun&lt;/a&gt;, simply do not return the &lt;a href=\"Dragonstone\"&gt;Dragonstone&lt;/a&gt; to &lt;a href=\"Farengar%20Secret-Fire\"&gt;Farengar Secret-Fire&lt;/a&gt;, thus beginning the quest \"&lt;a href=\"Dragon%20Rising\"&gt;Dragon Rising&lt;/a&gt;,\" and only visit settlements during daylight hours to avoid vampires. No dragons will be encountered (their burial sites will still be intact) and vampires do not appear during the day so the quests to purchase all properties, except Breezehome and Hjerim, can be safely completed. &lt;a href=\"Dragonsreach\"&gt;Dragonsreach&lt;/a&gt; can still be entered as long as the Dragonstone is not given to Farengar Secret-Fire.\n&lt;a href=\"Eastmarch%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Eastmarch&lt;/a&gt; (Capital: &lt;a href=\"Windhelm%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Windhelm&lt;/a&gt;).\nImperial Legion Questline.\nAfter completing the \"&lt;a href=\"Reunification%20of%20Skyrim\"&gt;Reunification of Skyrim&lt;/a&gt;\" quest, &lt;a href=\"Brunwulf%20Free-Winter\"&gt;Brunwulf Free-Winter&lt;/a&gt; will become Jarl of Windhelm. The Dragonborn must speak to Brunwulf, and Brunwulf will offer the title of Thane contingent on them helping five people of Windhelm and purchasing &lt;a href=\"Hjerim\"&gt;Hjerim&lt;/a&gt; from Brunwulf's steward. After these two objectives have been completed, Brunwulf will grant the Dragonborn the title of Thane, giving them a random leveled weapon of Eastmarch, and appoint a housecarl to serve them.\nStormcloak questline.\nAfter progressing through the questline, \"&lt;a href=\"Liberation%20of%20Skyrim\"&gt;Liberation of Skyrim&lt;/a&gt;,\" and liberating &lt;a href=\"Falkreath%20Hold%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Falkreath Hold&lt;/a&gt;, the Dragonborn will receive the option to become a Thane. This is done by selecting the \"My Jarl, is there anything further you need?\" conversation option. &lt;a href=\"Ulfric%20Stormcloak%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Ulfric Stormcloak&lt;/a&gt; will respond that there is a place in his court for a new Thane, but the title can only be given to one known throughout the hold and that owns property in Windhelm.\nIf neither questline has been started or progressed to the abovementioned levels, no opportunity to start the quest is present and Ulfric will assume the Dragonborn is there to join the Stormcloaks.\nRegardless of the questline followed, there are two requirements to becoming Thane of Eastmarch:\nThere are several easy ways to assist the people of Eastmarch:\nWhile completing \"&lt;a href=\"Blood%20on%20the%20Ice\"&gt;Blood on the Ice&lt;/a&gt;\" is not a prerequisite of becoming a Thane of Eastmarch, the quest will automatically start upon the purchase of Hjerim. Also, if on the Legion's side in the &lt;a href=\"Civil%20War\"&gt;Civil War&lt;/a&gt;, Brunwulf's bandit quest must be done to become a Thane anyway.\n&lt;a href=\"Falkreath%20Hold%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Falkreath Hold&lt;/a&gt; (Capital: &lt;a href=\"Falkreath%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Falkreath&lt;/a&gt;).\nIn brief.\nThere are many ways to become Thane as detailed in the section below. This is a set of steps you can take to become a Thane of Falkreath.\nIn detail.\nUpon speaking to Jarl &lt;a href=\"Siddgeir\"&gt;Siddgeir&lt;/a&gt;, he will request a bottle of &lt;a href=\"Black-Briar%20Mead\"&gt;Black-Briar Mead&lt;/a&gt;. If the Dragonborn waits to reach level 9 without visiting Falkreath, the Jarl will request to see them by sending a letter via &lt;a href=\"Courier%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;courier&lt;/a&gt;. Starting the quest via letter will skip the \"&lt;a href=\"Rare%20Gifts\"&gt;Rare Gifts&lt;/a&gt;\" quest for Siddgeir.\nThe starting quest for the Jarl to obtain a drink is a \"radiant\" quest that cannot be started if the Dragonborn is already on one of the following quests considered to be part of \"Rare Gifts.\"\nAfter getting his drink, the Jarl will give the Dragonborn a quest to kill a bandit leader in a radiant location. Upon completing this objective, the offer of becoming a Thane will be made.\nAssist three citizens of Falkreath Hold. This can be done in several ways, including:\nBecause Falkreath has the fewest citizen quests of any hold, and because the town is so open to dragon attacks, if the Dragonborn waits until the mid-game or endgame to become Thane, it can be difficult to find enough citizens alive to do three quests. This becomes an even worse problem with installed, as citizens will also be attacked by vampires. &lt;a href=\"Lod\"&gt;Lod&lt;/a&gt; (the blacksmith) and &lt;a href=\"Narri\"&gt;Narri&lt;/a&gt; (the tavern worker) can be killed. Players can usually find the remaining quests they need by finding citizens who tend to stay inside buildings and by investing 500 gold in &lt;a href=\"Gray%20Pine%20Goods\"&gt;Gray Pine Goods&lt;/a&gt; using the &lt;a href=\"Investor\"&gt;Investor&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Speech\"&gt;Speech&lt;/a&gt; skill.\nThe quest objective for the Jarl will be different depending on civil war quests.\nIf the expansion is installed (and enabled), the Dragonborn may receive a letter at any time early in their adventures from\u00a0&lt;a href=\"Siddgeir\"&gt;Siddgeir&lt;/a&gt; requesting a meeting at his longhouse in Falkreath. If this is the case, if the Dragonborn goes to meet him, the first part of this quest will be skipped entirely in favor of the next part of the quest to become a Thane.\nThe Jarl of Falkreath is added as a citizen so when the quest is started only two citizens need to be helped.\nRewards for earning this title include the &lt;a href=\"Blade%20of%20Falkreath\"&gt;Blade of Falkreath&lt;/a&gt;, along with the standard Thane option for dealing with pursuing guards in the hold.\n&lt;a href=\"Haafingar\"&gt;Haafingar&lt;/a&gt; (Capital: &lt;a href=\"Solitude%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Solitude&lt;/a&gt;).\nIn detail.\nTalk to &lt;a href=\"Falk%20Firebeard\"&gt;Falk Firebeard&lt;/a&gt; in the Blue Palace and he will give the quest \"&lt;a href=\"The%20Man%20Who%20Cried%20Wolf\"&gt;The Man Who Cried Wolf&lt;/a&gt;,\" investigating the lights and sounds coming out of &lt;a href=\"Wolfskull%20Cave\"&gt;Wolfskull Cave&lt;/a&gt;, which is located in the mountains west of Solitude. After completing the quest, talk to Falk again for a reward. Then speak directly to the &lt;a href=\"Elisif%20the%20Fair\"&gt;Jarl&lt;/a&gt; herself and she will thank them and assign one more task.\nShe will ask that &lt;a href=\"Torygg\"&gt;Torygg's&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Torygg%27s%20War%20Horn\"&gt;war horn&lt;/a&gt; be placed on a &lt;a href=\"Shrine%20of%20Talos\"&gt;Shrine of Talos&lt;/a&gt;, as a tribute to her late husband. Take the war horn to the specified Shrine and place it at the foot of the statue of Talos, then return to Elisif. She will invite the Dragonborn to become a Thane, but only after meeting the following requirements:\nThere are several ways to assist the people of Solitude, including:\nOnce this has been done, return to Jarl Elisif\u00a0and become a Thane of Haafingar and be given the &lt;a href=\"Blade%20of%20Haafingar\"&gt;Blade of Haafingar&lt;/a&gt;.\nSometime after Wolfskull Cave has been cleaned out and the Dragonborn has leveled up at least once, a courier arrives with a letter from Falk requesting a meeting. This initiates the quest to hunt down Potema's spirit, \"&lt;a href=\"The%20Wolf%20Queen%20Awakened\"&gt;The Wolf Queen Awakened&lt;/a&gt;.\" It is not required to become a Thane, but completing it counts toward the total of helping citizens in Solitude.\n&lt;a href=\"Hjaalmarch\"&gt;Hjaalmarch&lt;/a&gt; (Capital: &lt;a href=\"Morthal%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Morthal&lt;/a&gt;).\nIn detail.\nBecoming Thane of Hjaalmarch is fairly straightforward. Investigating the house that burned down, then completing the subsequent quests, will cause the grateful Jarl to say that she would be happy to make the Dragonborn a Thane once \"known through her Hold.\" This translates into taking miscellaneous quests to help three different people, most of whom can be found in Morthal. Note that completing the quest \"&lt;a href=\"Laid%20to%20Rest\"&gt;Laid to Rest&lt;/a&gt;\" may count as one of these assistance quests.\nIf the only reason for becoming Thane is to purchase the land for the \"Hearthfire\" DLC, it is not necessary to actually finish helping with the three tasks before being allowed to purchase the land. Upon finding and speak to &lt;a href=\"Aslfur\"&gt;Aslfur&lt;/a&gt;,\u00a0he may have a dialog option for buying a house, at which point he will say that while there are no houses available, he can sell some land.\nThe title also includes being awarded the &lt;a href=\"Blade%20of%20Hjaalmarch\"&gt;Blade of Hjaalmarch&lt;/a&gt;.\nSimilar to Falkreath, if this is attempted late in the game, it may be difficult to find three citizens alive to help, especially if \"Dawnguard\" is installed.\n&lt;a href=\"The%20Pale\"&gt;The Pale&lt;/a&gt; (Capital: &lt;a href=\"Dawnstar%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Dawnstar&lt;/a&gt;).\nThane of The Pale is obtained by completing the following tasks: The quest \"&lt;a href=\"Waking%20Nightmare\"&gt;Waking Nightmare&lt;/a&gt;,\" which is begun by talking to &lt;a href=\"Erandur\"&gt;Erandur&lt;/a&gt; in the Windpeak Inn. Then complete three minor quests. Alternatively, the player can complete the Civil War questline by siding with the Empire and get the title from &lt;a href=\"Brina%20Merilis\"&gt;Brina Merilis&lt;/a&gt; without having to complete Waking Nightmare, though they still must complete the three minor quests.\nThe Dragonborn must be level 22 to obtain the quest to kill a giant, which then leads to the offer to become a Thane (after completing the three minor quests).\nThe &lt;a href=\"Blade%20of%20the%20Pale\"&gt;Blade of the Pale&lt;/a&gt; is awarded along with the title.\n&lt;a href=\"The%20Reach\"&gt;The Reach&lt;/a&gt; (Capital: &lt;a href=\"Markarth%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Markarth&lt;/a&gt;).\nTo become a Thane of &lt;a href=\"Markarth%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Markarth&lt;/a&gt;, the Dragonborn needs to kill groups of &lt;a href=\"Forsworn\"&gt;Forsworn&lt;/a&gt; for the Jarl and his steward. They then must retrieve &lt;a href=\"Hrolfdir%27s%20Shield\"&gt;Hrolfdir's Shield&lt;/a&gt; (this quest is only given when at level 20 or higher). The Dragonborn must then help five citizens of Markarth and own &lt;a href=\"Vlindrel%20Hall%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Vlindrel Hall&lt;/a&gt; to become a Thane.\nAlternatively, the Dragonborn can side with the &lt;a href=\"Stormcloaks\"&gt;Stormcloaks&lt;/a&gt; and take The Reach by force through the &lt;a href=\"Civil%20War\"&gt;Civil War&lt;/a&gt; quests. This will change the Jarl to &lt;a href=\"Thongvor%20Silver-Blood\"&gt;Thongvor Silver-Blood&lt;/a&gt; and the Dragonborn will immediately be granted the permission to purchase property and become a Thane without doing anything else.\nThe above is also possible if the Dragonborn negotiated the exchange of Markarth during &lt;a href=\"Season%20Unending\"&gt;Season Unending&lt;/a&gt;. The &lt;a href=\"Blade%20of%20the%20Reach\"&gt;Blade of the Reach&lt;/a&gt; is awarded along with the title.\n&lt;a href=\"The%20Rift%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;The Rift&lt;/a&gt; (Capital: &lt;a href=\"Riften%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Riften&lt;/a&gt;).\nSpeak to the &lt;a href=\"Argonians%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Argonian&lt;/a&gt; named &lt;a href=\"Wujeeta\"&gt;Wujeeta&lt;/a&gt; in the fishery on the docks outside the city. Give her the &lt;a href=\"Potion%20of%20Healing\"&gt;Potion of Healing&lt;/a&gt; that she asks for, then ask her about her skooma dealer. Speak to the Jarl to begin the \"&lt;a href=\"Skooma%20Trade\"&gt;Skooma Trade&lt;/a&gt;\" Quest.\nFive other quests that help citizens of the Rift must be completed\u00a0before\u00a0the Jarl will offer the title.\u00a0When enough of these quests are completed, a new miscellaneous quest will appear, named, \"Speak to the Jarl of Riften.\"\u00a0Before the title can be accepted, &lt;a href=\"Honeyside\"&gt;Honeyside&lt;/a&gt; must be purchased (normally 8,000 , it can be purchased with only 5,000 ).\nThere are a number of quests that can be completed to assist the citizens of the Rift. They include:\n&lt;a href=\"Whiterun%20Hold\"&gt;Whiterun Hold&lt;/a&gt; (Capital: &lt;a href=\"Whiterun%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Whiterun&lt;/a&gt;).\nThe Dragonborn becomes a Thane of Whiterun as part of the main quest. After killing the &lt;a href=\"Mirmulnir\"&gt;dragon&lt;/a&gt; at the Western Watch Tower and revealing that they are the Dragonborn, the Jarl becomes eager to dub them Thane of Whiterun. After becoming a Thane of Whiterun the Jarl will award them the &lt;a href=\"Axe%20of%20Whiterun\"&gt;Axe of Whiterun&lt;/a&gt;.\nSiding with the &lt;a href=\"Stormcloaks\"&gt;Stormcloaks&lt;/a&gt; in the Civil War places &lt;a href=\"Vignar%20Gray-Mane\"&gt;Vignar Gray-Mane&lt;/a&gt; on the throne as Jarl of Whiterun and the Dragonborn's status as Thane is revoked. To become a Thane again, the Dragonborn must assist five citizens of Whiterun and purchase &lt;a href=\"Breezehome\"&gt;Breezehome&lt;/a&gt;, (if this has not already been done). Speak to Vignar after he is promoted to Jarl about becoming a Thane. He will award a &lt;a href=\"Blade%20of%20Whiterun\"&gt;Blade of Whiterun&lt;/a&gt; and grant them the title of Thane again.\n&lt;a href=\"Winterhold%20%28Skyrim%20Hold%29\"&gt;Winterhold&lt;/a&gt; (Capital: &lt;a href=\"Winterhold%20%28Skyrim%20City%29\"&gt;Winterhold&lt;/a&gt;).\nRetrieve the &lt;a href=\"Helm%20of%20Winterhold\"&gt;Helm of Winterhold&lt;/a&gt; from a radiant location for the &lt;a href=\"Jarl%20Korir\"&gt;Jarl Korir&lt;/a&gt;, and then help three people in the hold.\nAlternatively, if the Legion wins the Civil War the Dragonborn can simply talk to the new Jarl and then help three people in the hold, thus bypassing the retrieval of the Helm of Winterhold.\nHelping three people can be done by:\nThe &lt;a href=\"Blade%20of%20Winterhold\"&gt;Blade of Winterhold&lt;/a&gt; will be awarded, along with the new title."}

He is best known for turning himself into a cursed golden skull in a dark ritual, which became known as the &lt;a href=\"Golden%20Skull%20of%20Beela-Kaar\"&gt;Golden Skull of Beela-Kaar&lt;/a&gt;, a relic with the power to destroy all of Murkmire.\nBackground.\nBeela-Kaar served as an adviser of the &lt;a href=\"Saxhleel\"&gt;Saxhleel&lt;/a&gt; leaders in ancient Murkmire. He was a well-known healer, and healed many people with his magic; however, when a close mate of Beela-Kaar fell ill to a wasting disease, he devoted all his time to curing him. When Beela-Kaar had tried every possible cure without positive results, he turned over to &lt;a href=\"necromancy\"&gt;necromancy&lt;/a&gt;. Since he was unable to cure the disease, he let his mate die so he could reanimate him. The reanimation was successful, but the Argonians who lived in the district were horrified at Beela-Kaar's zombified mate, and begged him to let his thrall rest in peace. Beela-Kaar answered by taking control over a &lt;a href=\"xanmeer\"&gt;xanmeer&lt;/a&gt;, where he proceeded to perform dark necromantic rituals. After that Beela-Kaar was often referred to as \"The Mad Sorcerer.\"\nIt was only after one of Beela-Kaar's evil creations escaped the xanmeer\u2014causing troubles throughout the region\u2014that the elders of Murkmire decided to take action, ordering a band of warriors to stop him. The confrontation was met with great resistance, and after thirty-three days and thirty-three nights, Beela-Kaar had defeated every single warrior, only to reanimate them for his own undead army.\nBeela-Kaar realized that the xanmeer would eventually fall, so he decided to perform a final ritual, which involved turning himself into a powerful relic. The ritual destroyed his body, and the only thing left of him was his skull, which had turned golden. His skull became known as \"The Golden Skull of Beela-Kaar,\" possessing a curse that would destroy all of Murkmire if it were ever released. The skull was placed in a xanmeer in &lt;a href=\"Norg-Tzel\"&gt;Norg-Tzel&lt;/a&gt;."}

It is a run-down stone building with no inhabitants. Inside, there is an &lt;a href=\"Oblivion%20Gate%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Oblivion Gate&lt;/a&gt; that can transport you to the &lt;a href=\"Redguards%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Redguard&lt;/a&gt; manor.\nStage 0: Redguard manor.\nThe starting point of the Arena is a Redguard manor. It is surrounded in a circle of rocks and boulders, the manor located in a barren desert with a small river. Fa-Nuit-Hen can be found inside the farthest house with Tutor Riparius, alongside the hall with the champion busts. The portal is located inside the doors behind him.\nStage 1: Vale of the Surreal.\nThe Vale of the Surreal is a &lt;a href=\"Shivering%20Isles\"&gt;Shivering Isles&lt;/a&gt;-themed arena. The environment is large mushrooms and &lt;a href=\"Altmer%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Altmeri&lt;/a&gt; architecture, with a large tree in the center.\nStage 2: Seht's Balcony.\nAn arena based on &lt;a href=\"Sotha%20Sil\"&gt;Sotha Sil&lt;/a&gt;'s &lt;a href=\"Clockwork%20City%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Clockwork City&lt;/a&gt;. The architecture is a series of brass structures with spinning blades and electric hazards in the middle.\nStage 3: Drome of Toxic Shock.\nThe Drome of Toxic Shock is based off the environments of &lt;a href=\"Murkmire\"&gt;Murkmire&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Black%20Marsh%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Black Marsh&lt;/a&gt;. It is a swampland with some mounds of land covered in grass. It is surrounded by stony hills and a wooden barrier.\nStage 4: Seht's Flywheel.\nA second arena themed after Sotha Sil's city, this arena is similar to the Balcony. The design is different, being much more closed in with a thick brass pillar towering in the center. It is surrounded by tall brass walls.\nStage 5: Rink of Frozen Blood.\nA sub-zero arena based off the &lt;a href=\"Wrothgarian%20Mountains\"&gt;Wrothgarian Mountains&lt;/a&gt;. It is a large pond with toxic freezing water and three vulnerable ice platforms. There are a number of trees and mountains surrounding it.\nStage 6: Spiral Shadows.\nAn arena based off the &lt;a href=\"Spiral%20Skein\"&gt;Spiral Skein&lt;/a&gt;, this location contains gloomy fog and an eroded stone landscape. There are glowing mushrooms and stone structures dotting the arena.\nStage 7: Vault of Umbrage.\nAnother arena based off Murkmire, this location takes place in an underground &lt;a href=\"Ayleid%20Ruins%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Ayleid ruin&lt;/a&gt;. Moss hangs from the ceiling while mushrooms grow on the ground.\nStage 8: Igneous Cistern.\nThe Igneous Cistern takes place in a cavern found deep underground. It is surrounded by lava, with barren dirt mounds making up the only traversable land.\nStage 9: Theater of Despair.\nThe final round of the realm, this arena is based off &lt;a href=\"Mehrunes%20Dagon\"&gt;Mehrunes Dagon&lt;/a&gt;'s &lt;a href=\"Deadlands\"&gt;Deadlands&lt;/a&gt;. It is a large stone circular platform with a floating ring of stalactites hovering above.\nQuests.\n&lt;a href=\"Maelstrom%20Arena%20%28Quest%29\"&gt;Maelstrom Arena&lt;/a&gt;.\nSurvive the nine arenas of Maelstrom.\nEnemies.\nSeht's Flywheel.\nBosses:\nRink of Frozen Blood.\nBosses:\nSpiral Shadows.\nBosses:\nVault of Umbrage.\nBoss:\nIgneous Cistern.\nFinal boss: &lt;a href=\"Valkyn%20Tephra\"&gt;Valkyn Tephra&lt;/a&gt; (&lt;a href=\"Dremora%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Dremora&lt;/a&gt;)\nTheater of Despair.\nBosses:\nFinal boss:"}

Make your way through the area until you find the master of this plane, &lt;a href=\"Fa-Nuit-Hen\"&gt;Fa-Nuit-Hen&lt;/a&gt;. They will tell you that they made this plane to train strong warriors, and that his &lt;a href=\"Barons%20Who%20Move%20Like%20This\"&gt;Barons Who Move Like This&lt;/a&gt; have prepared a gauntlet of challenges for you to face\nProceed through the door ahead and then through the portal to the first battlefield, the Vale of the Surreal. In this Shivering Isles-inspired battlefield, you will face several rounds of lesser daedra before you face the final boss, &lt;a href=\"Maxus%20the%20Many\"&gt;Maxus the Many&lt;/a&gt;. Maxus likes to create copies of himself, so make sure to cull them from time to time so you do not get overwhelmed. \nAfter Maxus is dead, head through the next portal. This will lead you to Seht's Balcony, an arena inspired by a Dwemer ruin. In this arena, you will have to face several waves of Dwemer constructs while avoiding the spinning traps on the floor. The final bosses here are three Centurion Champions; each of them will periodically go inactive, during which time you cannot hurt them. Once all three are dead, head through the portal to the third arena, the Drome of Toxic Shock.\nIn this swamp-based battlefield, you will be facing enemies commonly found in the marshes, like &lt;a href=\"Lamia%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Lamias&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Wamasu%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Wamasus&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Argonians%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Argonians&lt;/a&gt;. The enemies here are tougher than in the previous two arenas, so take care. After several waves, you will face off against the &lt;a href=\"Lamia%20Queen\"&gt;Lamia Queen&lt;/a&gt;. Kill her, then head on through the next portal to Seht's Flywheel.\nThis arena is based on Sotha Sil's Clockwork City. The fights here are fairly straightforward. You will be facing scavengers and dwemer constructs. The final boss here is the Control Guardian, a giant construct that will slowly circle around the arena, shooting lightning at you. Occasionally, it will stop moving to set the ground below it on fire. Make sure to keep your distance when it does this. After you have killed the construct, head through the portal to the next arena, the Rink of Frozen Blood. \nThis arena will consist of a partially-frozen lake. The freezing waters here will damage your health, so try to stay on the ice as much as possible. You will be facing Ogres, Trolls, Frost Atronachs and Giants here. The trolls will try to break the ice platforms, so make sure to eliminate them as quickly as possible, before they get the chance to do that. The final boss is a giant named Matriarch Runa; like the trolls, she also likes to break the ice. When she breaks the sheet of ice you are fighting on, make sure to quickly make your way over to another sheet. After Runa lies dead, proceed onward to the next arena, the Spiral Shadows.\nThis arena draws inspiration from &lt;a href=\"Mephala\"&gt;Mephala&lt;/a&gt;'s &lt;a href=\"Spiral%20Skein\"&gt;Spiral Skein&lt;/a&gt;. You will be facing spiders, scorpions, hoarvors and harvesters here. every once in a while, a swarm of spiders will attack; stand near one of the glowing pillars throughout the arena to repel them. After several waves of these foes, the final boss of this section will appear, a &lt;a href=\"Spider%20Daedra%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Spider Daedra&lt;/a&gt; called the Champion of Atrocity. Slay this beast, then head on to the Vault of Umbrage. \nThis next battlefield will be in a swamp. You will mainly be facing argonians and trolls here. During the battle, you will notice strange plants spring up from the ground; these will explode and release a poisonous gas. If you get poisoned by this gas, head over to one of the green pools on the sides of the arena to cleanse yourself; if you do not do this quickly, the poison will kill you. If the screen goes green, that means an Argonian Venomcaller has spawned; these enemies will cause the plants to grow and explode more quickly, so take them out quickly. After several waves of enemies, the boss will spawn, an Argonian Behemoth. You will also notice that some lesser enemies will spawn called Argonian Minders. Do not kill these. The boss has a very powerful attack that will affect the whole battlefield and is guaranteed to kill you if you get hit, but the Minders will create a ward around themselves to protect themselves. If you are inside the ward, you survive, if not, you die. If there are no minders left alive, you have no chance of survival. Once the big argonian is dead, proceed through the next portal to the Igneous Cistern.\nThis battlefield is surrounded by lava, and fireballs will occasionally hit the battlefield as you fend off the Dremora and Flame Atronachs. The miniboss at the end of each wave can only be hit once you have destroyed the Warding Stone on the battlefield; fight off several waves like this until the boss, Valkyn Tephra, appears. She will have three warding stones you must destroy before you can hurt her, and she will occasionally repair them throughout the battle. Slay her, then head onward to the final arena, the Theater of Despair.\nThis battlefield is inspired by Mehrunes Dagon's Deadlands. Your enemies here will be regular daedra, with an Ash Titan finishing off the 5th wave. There will be ghosts flying around the arena; take care to avoid these. Every once in a while, a summoning ritual will begin at the center of the arena, make sure to interrupt it. After the regular enemies are all dead, the boss Voriak Solkyn will arrive. After you deal some damage to him, he will teleport into a cloud above the center of the arena; to damage him, you must use portals to get to the top floor and destroy the crystals there. Take care to avoid the enemy attacks though; the boss likes to knock you off into the lava below. Once the crystals are destroyed, the boss will return to the ground floor and you can kill him regularly. \nOnce the boss is dead, head through the portal back to the entrance and speak with Fa-Nuit-Hen to finish the quest."}

The schools include &lt;a href=\"Destruction%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;Destruction&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Illusion%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;Illusion&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Mysticism%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;Mysticism&lt;/a&gt;. Only spell effects from the Destruction school deal physical damage. Spells such as &lt;a href=\"Paralyze%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;paralyze&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Dispel%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;dispel&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Silence%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;silence&lt;/a&gt; from the Illusion and Mysticism schools respectively are combat-based spells, while &lt;a href=\"Charm%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;charm&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Telekinesis%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;telekinesis&lt;/a&gt; are passive abilities typically used outside of battle situations.\nCommonality and selection.\nStaves with Destruction enchantments are not uncommon, commonly found on &lt;a href=\"Lich%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;Liches&lt;/a&gt; and other spell-casting &lt;a href=\"Creatures%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;enemies&lt;/a&gt;. Despite its convenience, choosing another enchantment may be wiser. Particularly recommended would be paralysis, since &lt;a href=\"Spells%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;spells&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Poison%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;poisons&lt;/a&gt; causing Paralysis are rare and expensive.

Though most Mages tend to specialize into one school of &lt;a href=\"magic\"&gt;magic&lt;/a&gt; it is not uncommon for a Mage to have significant skill in all schools of magic including the art of &lt;a href=\"alchemy\"&gt;alchemy&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe Mage is a premade &lt;a href=\"class\"&gt;class&lt;/a&gt;.\nDescription and use.\nThe mage is an all around class that, if used correctly, can be exceptionally powerful. A well-equipped mage can tackle a wide range of situations; whether it be a difficult &lt;a href=\"lock\"&gt;lock&lt;/a&gt; or a stubborn &lt;a href=\"merchant\"&gt;merchant&lt;/a&gt;, magic can be used to overcome it. Although not quite as easy as being a melee fighter, a mage can be far more powerful than any &lt;a href=\"Warrior%20%28Class%29\"&gt;warrior&lt;/a&gt;. The different magical schools give mages a great deal of versatility: destruction to obliterate foes, conjuration to summon &lt;a href=\"daedric\"&gt;daedric&lt;/a&gt; minions, &lt;a href=\"enchanting\"&gt;enchanting&lt;/a&gt; to ameliorate &lt;a href=\"apparel\"&gt;apparel&lt;/a&gt;, illusion to hide themselves or trick others, and restoration to heal their wounds.\nBeing a mage can be difficult, especially for beginners. Magicka shortages can be a constant source of frustration, so mage players often stockpile potions that restore their magicka pool or fortify their intellect (which expands it). With diligence and caution, however, players with experienced mage characters may ultimately find it to be one of the \"easiest \"classes\u00a0to play:\u00a0players can hotkey healing spells to use in battle in place of healing potions; in \"Morrowind\" and \"Oblivion\", mages can enchant items with &lt;a href=\"Chameleon\"&gt;Chameleon&lt;/a&gt;, effectively gaining permanent cloaking; alteration enables mages to breathe in or walk on water and open locks without lockpicks; etc."}

Mages spend many years studying &lt;a href=\"Schools%20of%20Magicka\"&gt;schools&lt;/a&gt; of the arcane arts, leaving behind most other pursuits. Depending on their magical abilities for offensive and defensive power, mages are typically lacking in &lt;a href=\"Armor%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;armor&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"Shields%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;shields&lt;/a&gt; and utilize limited to no &lt;a href=\"Weapons%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;physical weaponry&lt;/a&gt;.\nDestruction.\n&lt;a href=\"Destruction%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Destruction&lt;/a&gt; is used to create elemental attacks, thus being used as an offensive form of magic to defeat foes. It is almost essential to any mage that plays an offensive role. Generally, destruction magic is split into three types of &lt;a href=\"spells%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;spells&lt;/a&gt;: &lt;a href=\"Fire%20Damage%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;fire&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Frost%20Damage%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;frost&lt;/a&gt;, and\u00a0&lt;a href=\"Shock%20Damage%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;shock&lt;/a&gt;.\nConjuration.\n&lt;a href=\"Conjuration%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Conjuration&lt;/a&gt; is used to &lt;a href=\"Atronach\"&gt;summon powerful creatures&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Bound%20Weapons%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;weapons&lt;/a&gt; from the &lt;a href=\"planes%20of%20Oblivion\"&gt;planes of Oblivion&lt;/a&gt;. It may also be used to &lt;a href=\"Raise%20Zombie\"&gt;raise the dead&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Soul%20Trap%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;steal souls&lt;/a&gt; of the living as they die.\nRestoration.\n&lt;a href=\"Restoration%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Restoration&lt;/a&gt; magic is focused on creating and harnessing life force, thus it is commonly used for healing wounds. It also has spells called\u00a0&lt;a href=\"Ward%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Ward&lt;/a&gt;s,\u00a0which can be used to reduce the damage inflicted by enemy spells, just like a shield would block an enemy blow. Restoration also has a series of spells used to &lt;a href=\"Turn%20Undead%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;turn&lt;/a&gt; and/or even &lt;a href=\"Bane%20of%20the%20Undead\"&gt;harm the undead&lt;/a&gt;.\nAlteration.\n&lt;a href=\"Alteration%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Alteration&lt;/a&gt; spells change reality in a specific way.

Alteration isn't a specific set of spells, but rather a wide variety of spells each with unique effects.\nIllusion.\n&lt;a href=\"Illusion%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Illusion&lt;/a&gt; involves manipulating the mind of the enemy. This school of magic involves spells like &lt;a href=\"Fury%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Fury&lt;/a&gt;,\u00a0&lt;a href=\"Fear%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Fear&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Calm%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Calm&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Muffle\"&gt;Muffle&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Invisibility%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Invisibility&lt;/a&gt;.\nEnchanting.\n&lt;a href=\"Enchanting%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Enchanting&lt;/a&gt;\u00a0involves adding magical effects to weapons and apparel using filled &lt;a href=\"Soul%20Gem%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;soul gems&lt;/a&gt; at an\u00a0&lt;a href=\"arcane%20enchanter\"&gt;arcane enchanter&lt;/a&gt;."}

The perk causes protection spells like &lt;a href=\"Stoneflesh\"&gt;Stoneflesh&lt;/a&gt; to become twice as strong if the caster is not wearing &lt;a href=\"Armor%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;armor&lt;/a&gt; (+0.5x per additional rank). &lt;a href=\"Clothing%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Clothing&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Robes%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;robes&lt;/a&gt;, hoods, &lt;a href=\"Rings%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;rings&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Amulets%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;amulets&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"circlets\"&gt;circlets&lt;/a&gt; constitute as non-armor pieces under this perk.

Due to lowered &lt;a href=\"Encumbrance%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;carrying capacity&lt;/a&gt;, mages struggle to lug around heavy pieces of armor. \"Ebonyflesh,\" outfitted with three \"Mage Armor\" perks, reaches an armor class total of 300. One downfall of Mage Armor spells lies in their limited duration. It may be difficult to switch between offensive spells and Mage Armor spells during battle to protect against melee blows. Conversely, Mage Armor spells can make close combat situations easier, especially when wielding some &lt;a href=\"Bound%20Weapons%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Bound Weapons&lt;/a&gt; or when &lt;a href=\"Soul%20Trap%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Soul Trapping&lt;/a&gt; at melee range. Coupling Mage Armor spells with cloak spells such as &lt;a href=\"Lightning%20Cloak\"&gt;Lightning Cloak&lt;/a&gt; causes &lt;a href=\"Creatures%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;foes&lt;/a&gt; to take damage per second from the cloak, while shielding the caster from the physical blows of the target."}

They serve no integral purpose to the storyline, and their foremost job is lecturing the &lt;a href=\"Mage%20Apprentice\"&gt;apprentices&lt;/a&gt;.\nEquipment and Battle Behavior.\nAll Mage Scholars wear a standard mage's robe and a pair of russet felt shoes. In combat they rely on an &lt;a href=\"Iron%20Dagger%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;Iron Dagger&lt;/a&gt; and a second, enchanted, leveled dagger. In addition, all Mage Scholars will be able to cast three &lt;a href=\"Destruction%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;Destruction&lt;/a&gt; spells (two weak, one powerful), three weak &lt;a href=\"Conjuration%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;Conjuration&lt;/a&gt; spells (two Bound Armor and one Summon), one powerful &lt;a href=\"Restoration%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;Restoration&lt;/a&gt; spell and one powerful &lt;a href=\"Illusion%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;Illusion&lt;/a&gt; spell.\nRoutine.\nThe Mage Scholars share highly similar schedules. They are often encountered walking the grounds of the Arcane University, where they might be caught in conversation with one of their colleagues or students. They can be heard discussing about various topics. At 10am and 4pm, the apprentices have classes, each scholar has a chance of teaching the class about Doomstones and Runestones, near the Praxographical Center. All of them sleep at the Mages' quarters, half of them sleep from midnight until 6am, while three others sleep from 6pm until midnight.\nLessons.\nThe Mage Scholars can be seen teaching the &lt;a href=\"Mage%20Apprentice\"&gt;Mage Apprentice&lt;/a&gt;s about Runestones and Doomstones, the lessons going as follows:\nFirst lesson.\nFirst, all rune-marked ancient stones are called &lt;a href=\"runestones\"&gt;runestones&lt;/a&gt;, though there are, in fact, two very different classes of runestones.\n&lt;a href=\"Doomstones\"&gt;Doomstones&lt;/a&gt; have red runes, and are associated with stone circles. Runestones have blue runes, and appear as solitary monuments.\nThe runes for which the stones are named glow in the dark; however, there is no evidence that the stones are magical.\nVarious naturally occurring minerals and crystals, like glass and ebony, glow in the dark by their own light -- without being magical.\nHowever, the universal belief that runestones are &lt;a href=\"magic\"&gt;magical&lt;/a&gt;, despite all evidence, is good reason to suspect that the runestones are indeed magical.\nOne theory is that the stones were once magical, but they have lost their magic, either through age and disuse, or because of sin or neglect.\nIt may also be that they are magical, but only for certain individuals or under certain circumstances, or that their magics are secret.\nSecond lesson.\nThere are six commonly recognized varieties of runestone.\nBirthstone Doomstones bear red runes, appear with stone circles, and are associated with the classic birthsigns like &lt;a href=\"the%20Apprentice\"&gt;the Apprentice&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"the%20Atronach\"&gt;the Atronach&lt;/a&gt;.\nHeavenly Doomstones bear red runes, appear with stone circles, and are associated with cosmic features of the heavens like the moons &lt;a href=\"Jone\"&gt;Jone&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Jode\"&gt;Jode&lt;/a&gt;.\nHestra Runestones are marked with green runes, appear as solitary monuments, and are believed to be named for the late &lt;a href=\"First%20Era\"&gt;First Era&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Empress%20Hestra\"&gt;Empress Hestra&lt;/a&gt;.\nReman Runestones are solitary monuments marked with green runes, almost certainly named for &lt;a href=\"Reman%20Cyrodiil\"&gt;Reman Cyrodiil&lt;/a&gt;, the First Era emperor.\n&lt;a href=\"Sidri-Ashak\"&gt;Sidri-Ashak&lt;/a&gt; Runestones are single standing stones marked with green runes, thought to be named for an obscure &lt;a href=\"Akaviri\"&gt;Akaviri&lt;/a&gt; potentate, Sidri-Ashak.\nFort Runestones are stones with green runes, found singly or in pairs, in the ruins of some subterranean First Era forts.\nThese names offer few hints to the origin or function of the stones, though they assist scholars in identifying each type of stone on maps.\nThird lesson.\nSuppose that the runestones are divine, and that the secrets of their magics are revealed only by divine revelation.\nSuppose that the runestones existed, for whatever reason, and in whatever form, long before the coming of the Cyrodilic emperors.\nSuppose, however, that the power of these stones had been hidden, but was revealed to certain holy men or prophets in the First Era.\nSuppose that, under the guidance of the gods, these runestones were newly consecrated to a great purpose... the founding of the &lt;a href=\"Cyrodilic%20Empire\"&gt;Cyrodilic Empire&lt;/a&gt;.\nOnce these ancient monuments might have been powerful bulwarks of the Cyrodilic emperors, battlemages, and priests.\nBut imagine, as the &lt;a href=\"emperor\"&gt;emperor&lt;/a&gt;s grew weak, and as the power and glory of the Empire waned, and as the people fell away from their service to the gods...\nImagine that the power of these runestones might have diminished -- weakened, then extinguished -- by the sins of the Potentates.\nFew records survive from the Dark Ages of the Potentates. Thus might the secrets of the runestones be lost... in wickedness, vainglory, and neglect.\nFourth lesson.\nCyrodiil's runestones are thought to belong to one of three time periods: the &lt;a href=\"Dawn%20Era\"&gt;Dawn Era&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"Merethic%20Era\"&gt;Merethic Era&lt;/a&gt;, or the late First Era.\nThose who believe the runestones to be Dawn Era artifacts, created by the &lt;a href=\"Aedra\"&gt;Aedra&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"Daedra\"&gt;Daedra&lt;/a&gt;, often describe them as &lt;a href=\"Lorkhan\"&gt;Lorkhan&lt;/a&gt;'s birthing gift to mortals.\nOthers assign the runestones to the Merethic or Early First Era, primarily on the basis of their simple, even crude design and craft.\nThe most common practice is to place the raising of the runestones within the High First Era Cyrodiil of Empress Hestra and the Reman Emperors.\nRunestones found in forts like &lt;a href=\"Sancre%20Tor\"&gt;Sancre Tor&lt;/a&gt; support a First Era date, though the stones could have been moved to the forts from earlier sites.\nThe greatest objection to First Era dating is that the stones are completely unlike any other examples of First Era architecture.\nI believe the runestones date from the Dawn Era or Merethic Age, but they were moved to new sites by late First Era emperors.\nSince the runestones have lost their enchantments, however, we may never know why they were moved, or what function they served at First Era sites.\nFifth lesson.\nIgnore the controversy of whether the runestones are enchanted. Let me suggest one possible account for the placements of the runestones.\nBefore &lt;a href=\"Tiber%20Septim\"&gt;Tiber Septim&lt;/a&gt;, Cyrodiil's roads varied greatly in quality, and were often impassible in bad weather and winter seasons.\nIn the late First Era, Empress Hestra improved the roads, and the Reman Emperors continued her policies.\nThe last period of First Era road-building was in the reign of the last strong Akaviri Potentate, Sidri-Ashak.\nNote that three classes of runestones are named, respectively, Hestra Stones, Reman Stones, and Sidri-Ashak Stones.\nCould these runestones have served as waypoints and landmarks for military patrols of the nascent &lt;a href=\"Imperial%20Legion\"&gt;Imperial Legion&lt;/a&gt;?\nDid battlemages activate runestones on arrival, thus lighting arcane beacons within the next runestone?\nThe &lt;a href=\"Mages%20Guild\"&gt;Mages Guild&lt;/a&gt; should fund further study of the early Imperial Legions, their &lt;a href=\"Imperial%20Legion%20Battlemage%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;battlemages&lt;/a&gt;, and their traditions of patrol and route-finding."}

Previously, the only organization with a similar aim and structure to the Mages Guild was the &lt;a href=\"Psijic%20Order\"&gt;Psijic Order&lt;/a&gt; of the &lt;a href=\"Isle%20of%20Artaeum\"&gt;Isle of Artaeum&lt;/a&gt;.\n&lt;a href=\"Vanus%20Galerion\"&gt;Vanus Galerion&lt;/a&gt;, a Psijic of Artaeum and student of the famed &lt;a href=\"Iachesis\"&gt;Iachesis&lt;/a&gt;, began organizing users of magic from around &lt;a href=\"Summerset%20Isle\"&gt;Summerset Isle&lt;/a&gt; at the urban city of &lt;a href=\"Firsthold\"&gt;Firsthold&lt;/a&gt;. At the time, this gathering and conduction of magical experiments in populated areas was considered unacceptable. Even more shocking, Galerion proposed to make magical items, potions, and even spells available to any member of the general public who could afford to pay.\nGalerion was brought before Iachesis and the King of &lt;a href=\"Firsthold\"&gt;Firsthold&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Rilis%20XII\"&gt;Rilis XII&lt;/a&gt;, and made to state the intentions of the fraternity he was forming.

Although initially the Guild was rejected in some areas of Tamriel, eventually it was accepted and became a powerful force in Tamriel. There have been only a few rare incidents of the Mages Guild actually becoming involved in local political struggles. On these occasions, the Guild's participation has been the ultimate decider in the conflict.\nInfrastructure.\nAs begun by Vanus Galerion, the Mages Guild as an institution is presided over by a supreme council of six &lt;a href=\"Arch-Mage\"&gt;Arch-Mage&lt;/a&gt;s, with subsequent masters over certain Areas, creating a pseudo-bureaucracy. One need not be a member of the Mages Guild to know that this carefully contrived hierarchy is often nothing more than a chimera. As Vanus Galerion himself said bitterly, leaving Tamriel to travel to other lands, \"The Guild has become nothing more than an intricate morass of political infighting.\"\nProvincial Chapters.\nHigh Rock.\nMultiple Mages Guild headquarters existed in the Second and Third eras in the &lt;a href=\"Glenumbra\"&gt;Glenumbra&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Stormhaven\"&gt;Stormhaven&lt;/a&gt; regions surrounding Illiac Bay, along with guildhalls in &lt;a href=\"Rivenspire\"&gt;Rivenspire&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Bangkorai\"&gt;Bangkorai&lt;/a&gt; during the Second. A Mages Guild was also established in the &lt;a href=\"Second%20Orsinium\"&gt;Second Orsinium&lt;/a&gt; under the orders of &lt;a href=\"King%20Kurog\"&gt;King Kurog&lt;/a&gt;, who sought to have magical studies integrated as part of Orcish education.\nHammerfell.\nDuring &lt;a href=\"The%20Forebears\"&gt;Forbear&lt;/a&gt; High King &lt;a href=\"Fahara%27jad\"&gt;Fahara'jad&lt;/a&gt;'s rule in &lt;a href=\"2E%20582\"&gt;2E 582&lt;/a&gt;, the Mages Guild had headquarters in &lt;a href=\"Sentinel\"&gt;Sentinel&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Hallin%27s%20Stand\"&gt;Hallin's Stand&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Belkarth\"&gt;Belkarth&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Bergama\"&gt;Bergama&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Kozanset\"&gt;Kozanset&lt;/a&gt;. The Guild came fairly late in the &lt;a href=\"The%20Crowns\"&gt;Crown&lt;/a&gt;-supporting areas compared to other provinces, the one in Stros M'kai being set up in only &lt;a href=\"2E%20660\"&gt;2E 660&lt;/a&gt;. According to &lt;a href=\"Cyrus%20%28Redguard%29\"&gt;Cyrus&lt;/a&gt;, the traditional Redguards had a dislike against magic due to the historic conflict with the &lt;a href=\"Left-handed%20Elves\"&gt;Left-handed Elves&lt;/a&gt;.\nMorrowind.\nThere is a &lt;a href=\"Mages%20Guild%20%28Morrowind%29\"&gt;Mages Guild&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Morrowind\"&gt;Morrowind&lt;/a&gt;, lead by &lt;a href=\"Arch-Mage\"&gt;Arch-Mage&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Trebonius%20Artorius\"&gt;Trebonius Artorius&lt;/a&gt;. Mages Guild chapters are \"established in Guild-owned, free-standing guildhalls in the towns of &lt;a href=\"Ald%27ruhn\"&gt;Ald'ruhn&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Balmora\"&gt;Balmora&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Caldera\"&gt;Caldera&lt;/a&gt;,\" with additional guildhalls existing in &lt;a href=\"Vivec%20City\"&gt;Vivec City&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Wolverine%20Hall\"&gt;Wolverine Hall&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Sadrith%20Mora\"&gt;Sadrith Mora&lt;/a&gt;.\" The most notable event from this province was the discovery of the reason for the &lt;a href=\"Dwemer\"&gt;Dwemer&lt;/a&gt;'s disappearance.A mages guild existed at one point in &lt;a href=\"Gnisis\"&gt;Gnisis&lt;/a&gt;, but was later abandoned for reasons unknown. They also are often in conflict with the other Magic-users of &lt;a href=\"Vvardenfell\"&gt;Vvardenfell&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"House%20Telvanni\"&gt;House Telvanni&lt;/a&gt;. It also appears that the Guild was responsible for the education of the population of Vvardenfell, as seen in &lt;a href=\"Ilmeni%20Dren\"&gt;Ilmeni Dren&lt;/a&gt;'s &lt;a href=\"Literacy%20Campaign\"&gt;Literacy Campaign&lt;/a&gt;.\nCyrodiil.\nIn &lt;a href=\"Cyrodiil\"&gt;Cyrodiil&lt;/a&gt;, the heart of the &lt;a href=\"Empire\"&gt;Empire&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"Mages%20Guild%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;Mages Guild&lt;/a&gt; is headed by the &lt;a href=\"Arcane%20University\"&gt;Arcane University&lt;/a&gt;. With exclusive and selective membership, the University is a place of learning for &lt;a href=\"Mage%20%28Class%29\"&gt;mages&lt;/a&gt; both experienced and not. The &lt;a href=\"Council%20of%20Mages\"&gt;Council of Mages&lt;/a&gt;, centered by the &lt;a href=\"Arch-Mage\"&gt;Arch-Mage&lt;/a&gt;, leads the Arcane University. Each city in Cyrodiil, excluding &lt;a href=\"Kvatch\"&gt;Kvatch&lt;/a&gt;, hosts a guildhall of Mages. Each city specializes in a specific &lt;a href=\"School%20of%20Magicka\"&gt;School of Magicka&lt;/a&gt;.\nEntrance into the Arcane University requires &lt;a href=\"associate\"&gt;associate&lt;/a&gt;s of the guild to receive recommendations from the leader of each guild hall. In &lt;a href=\"3E%20431\"&gt;3E 431&lt;/a&gt;, Arch-Mage &lt;a href=\"Hannibal%20Traven%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;Hannibal Traven&lt;/a&gt; instated a highly controversial &lt;a href=\"Necromancy%20Ban%20of%203E%20431\"&gt;ban on Necromancy&lt;/a&gt;, which inevitably lead to the returned presence of &lt;a href=\"Mannimarco\"&gt;Mannimarco&lt;/a&gt;, King of Worms. The guild was dismantled sometime after the &lt;a href=\"Oblivion%20Crisis\"&gt;Oblivion Crisis&lt;/a&gt;. Members of the guild split into the &lt;a href=\"College%20of%20Whispers\"&gt;College of Whispers&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"The%20Synod\"&gt;The Synod&lt;/a&gt;.\nSkyrim.\nIn &lt;a href=\"2E%20582\"&gt;2E 582&lt;/a&gt;, there were Mages Guildhalls present in &lt;a href=\"Riften\"&gt;Riften&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Nimalten\"&gt;Nimalten&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Shor%27s%20Stone\"&gt;Shor's Stone&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Windhelm\"&gt;Windhelm&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Fort%20Amol\"&gt;Fort Amol&lt;/a&gt;. As of the Fourth Era, no official mages guild exists in the province and neither the College of Whispers or The Synod have a presence there. Those interested in magic may study at the independent College of Winterhold."}

The &lt;a href=\"Nerevarine\"&gt;Nerevarine&lt;/a&gt; is able to join this faction thereby gaining access to guild trainers, quest, and ability to progress through the guild's ranks. The Mages Guild focuses on mastery over the various arcane arts.\nHistory.\nMuch of what is known about the founding of the Mages Guild is through the work of the Archmage &lt;a href=\"Salarth\"&gt;Salarth&lt;/a&gt;: \"&lt;a href=\"Origin%20of%20the%20Mages%20Guild\"&gt;Origin of the Mages Guild&lt;/a&gt;\".\nThe order was originally founded by a member of &lt;a href=\"Psijic%20Order\"&gt;Psijic Order&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Vanus%20Galerion\"&gt;Vanus Galerion&lt;/a&gt;, circa the &lt;a href=\"Second%20Era\"&gt;Second Era&lt;/a&gt;. The order was originally established in &lt;a href=\"Firsthold\"&gt;Firsthold&lt;/a&gt; on the &lt;a href=\"Summerset%20Isles\"&gt;Summerset Isles&lt;/a&gt;. One of Galerion's most controversial proposals was to make magic items, potions, and spells available to any member of the general public who could afford to pay.\nShortly after the founding, with security of the guild becoming a concern, the Knightly &lt;a href=\"Order%20of%20the%20Lamp\"&gt;Order of the Lamp&lt;/a&gt; was formed. The Mages Guild grew with branches across the Summerset Isles and gradually the mainland, eventually becoming a powerful force in Tamriel.\nJoining the Mages Guild.\nIn order to join the guild, a potential candidate must meet the minimum requirements and speak to one of the six Guildmagisters, leaders of the local guild halls. The Guildmagisters are located in the Mages Guild Halls in five major cities:\nFavorite skills.\nFavorite skills are the skills that a member of the Mages Guild need to master to advance in the ranks.\nGuild Ranks.\nThere are a total of ten ranks within the Mages Guild that can be completed through &lt;a href=\"Mages%20Guild%20Quests%20%28Morrowind%29\"&gt;Mages Guild Quests&lt;/a&gt; and increasing &lt;a href=\"Attributes%20%28Morrowind%29\"&gt;attributes&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Skills%20%28Morrowind%29\"&gt;skills&lt;/a&gt;. Higher ranks affects the members' disposition towards them, and they also open new quests, merchants, and trainers.\nGuild Guides.\nWithin each Mages Guild there is a Guild Guide, who allows instant travel to any of the other Mages Guild halls in &lt;a href=\"Morrowind\"&gt;Morrowind&lt;/a&gt;.\nWith add-on, there are two more guides added, only to travel to and from &lt;a href=\"Mournhold%20%28Tribunal%29\"&gt;Mournhold&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Ebonheart%20%28Morrowind%29\"&gt;Ebonheart&lt;/a&gt;:\nBugs.\nDivine Intervention and Almsivi Intervention Glitch.\nIf transporting from one Mages Guild to another using the Guild Guide, the new location is not reset until exiting to an outside area. In addition, the World Map is not reset (for all guilds) until exiting the Mages Guild to which the character was transported. Specifically, if the character uses a guild guide to instantly travel between mages guilds, and then initiates &lt;a href=\"Divine%20Intervention%20%28Morrowind%29\"&gt;Divine Intervention&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"Almsivi%20Intervention\"&gt;Almsivi Intervention&lt;/a&gt; before exiting to an 'outside' location, they will be transported into the Fort or Temple, respectively, that was closest to the guild of departure (not the guild to which the guild guide sent them). This happens even if the character uses a guide to arrive at one Mages Guild, then uses that guide to go to a third, (etc.) Mages Guild, as long as the character did not go 'outside' at any time during this chain of journeys.\nExample: The character uses the Ald'ruhn's Mages Guild guide to arrive at Balmora's Mages Guild, and then uses that guild's guide to arrive at Vivec City's Mages Guild in the Foreign Quarter Canton's Plaza. The character then uses &lt;a href=\"Divine%20Intervention%20%28Morrowind%29\"&gt;Divine Intervention&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"Almsivi%20Intervention\"&gt;Almsivi Intervention&lt;/a&gt; before ever going 'outside'. The intervention spell or scroll will transport the character to Buckmoth Legion Fort or Ald'ruhn's Tribunal Temple (the closest intervention locations to Ald' ruhn), and not to Ebonheart or the Temple Canton (which are the closest arrival points from the Foreign Quarter Canton).\nNote: For Balmora and Caldera, exiting their respective Mages Guilds will place the character 'outside' (thus, refreshing the location). In the Foreign Quarter, the Mages Guild is not outside, even if the character enters another building of the Plaza (the Plaza must be exited before the location is correctly refreshed). Likewise, the refresh requires exiting to an 'outside' area of Wolverine Hall (if the arrival is Sadrith Mora's Mages Guild).\nRegarding the identified location in the map, this glitch impacts the World map (but not the Local map). The original place-of-departure will be still be displayed on the World Map, but only if the arrival location is either Vivec City's Mages Guild or Sadrith Mora's Mages Guild. The map will be refreshed to show the correct location upon exiting the current Mages Guild building (even while still inside either the Foreign Quarter Plaza or Wolverine Hall Fort).\nThus, the Map refresh mechanism only requires exiting the Mages Guild buildings, but to refresh the Intervention-travel mechanism, it requires exiting to an 'outside' area."}

There have been only a few rare incidents of the Mages Guild actually becoming involved in local political struggles.

Each guild hall (except for the one in Bruma) has a magic school specialty. This specialty is evidenced in the training services offered and the available spells for sale, often corresponding to their main magic school. Guild halls also offer to recharge &lt;a href=\"Enchanting%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;enchanted&lt;/a&gt; items for a fee of 1 per recharge point.

If this is not possible, simply reverse-pickpocket items into Vidkun. Otherwise, drowning is likely. It may be more beneficial to collect the &lt;a href=\"Jewel%20of%20the%20Rumare\"&gt;Jewel of the Rumare&lt;/a&gt; by completing \"&lt;a href=\"Go%20Fish\"&gt;Go Fish&lt;/a&gt;\" before exploring this location, to prevent possible drowning. &lt;a href=\"Argonians%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;Argonians&lt;/a&gt;, natural able to &lt;a href=\"Water%20Breathing%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;breathe underwater&lt;/a&gt;, encounter little trouble here.\nOther uses.\nEvading a bounty.\nWhen a &lt;a href=\"Crime%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;bounty&lt;/a&gt; has been accrued in Cheydinhal, the well can be hidden in if a means for Water Breathing and &lt;a href=\"Invisibility%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;Invisibility&lt;/a&gt; (or having high defensive capabilities) exist. &lt;a href=\"City%20Watch\"&gt;Guards&lt;/a&gt; are lead into the well to catch the criminal, but will quickly drown, especially if a &lt;a href=\"Burden%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;Burden&lt;/a&gt; spell is cast upon them while they're underwater.\nBeginning the Dark Brotherhood questline.\nDirectly outside the well is a sleeping &lt;a href=\"Beggars%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;beggar&lt;/a&gt;. Because the buildings enclosing the well block the view from the main streets, guards are likely not to witness the beggar's murder, allowing the Cheydinhal Recommendation and the opening sequence for the &lt;a href=\"Dark%20Brotherhood%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;Dark Brotherhood&lt;/a&gt; questline to be completed at the same time, if the Recommendation is begun at night."}

Magic is the manipulation of magicka in order to directly control reality in some way. The individual casting of this force to form a mystical effect is called a &lt;a href=\"spell\"&gt;spell&lt;/a&gt;. A practitioner of magic is generally called a &lt;a href=\"Mage%20%28Class%29\"&gt;mage&lt;/a&gt;, and one who fights with both melee weapons and magic is a &lt;a href=\"battlemage\"&gt;battlemage&lt;/a&gt; or a &lt;a href=\"spellsword\"&gt;spellsword&lt;/a&gt;. Those who prefer magical and thief skills are called nightblades. Although all &lt;a href=\"races\"&gt;races&lt;/a&gt; generally possess some degree of magical aptitudes, those with &lt;a href=\"Mer\"&gt;elvish blood&lt;/a&gt; in particular far outshine the others. Magic is governed by the &lt;a href=\"Intelligence\"&gt;Intelligence&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Willpower\"&gt;Willpower&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"attributes\"&gt;attributes&lt;/a&gt;.\nBackground and history.\nMagic is usually associated with &lt;a href=\"Magnus\"&gt;Magnus&lt;/a&gt;, the god of sorcery, and it is believed that magic is what is left of him on the world. Because Magnus escaped from &lt;a href=\"Mundus\"&gt;Mundus&lt;/a&gt;, it is thought that magic has no limits. Magic originates from &lt;a href=\"Aetherius\"&gt;Aetherius&lt;/a&gt;, from which it passes through the sun and the stars and reaches Mundus. Magic was purportedly first used by &lt;a href=\"men\"&gt;men&lt;/a&gt; during the month of &lt;a href=\"Rain%27s%20Hand\"&gt;Rain's Hand&lt;/a&gt;, which is also the season of &lt;a href=\"the%20Mage\"&gt;the Mage&lt;/a&gt;. People born under the sign of the mage have more &lt;a href=\"magicka\"&gt;magicka&lt;/a&gt; and talent for spellcasting. People born under the sign of &lt;a href=\"The%20Apprentice\"&gt;The Apprentice&lt;/a&gt; have a special affinity to magic and are more vulnerable to it, and people born under the sign of &lt;a href=\"The%20Atronach\"&gt;The Atronach&lt;/a&gt; are natural sorcerers with vast reserves of magicka, but they cannot generate magicka on their own.\nThroughout the &lt;a href=\"Merethic%20Era\"&gt;Merethic Era&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"First%20Era\"&gt;First Era&lt;/a&gt; magic was practiced mostly by solitary individuals or hermits. There were only a handful communities of mages who banded together for the purpose of magical research. The most notable of these groups were the &lt;a href=\"Psijics\"&gt;Psijics&lt;/a&gt;, who offered counsel to the rulers of the &lt;a href=\"Summerset%20Isles\"&gt;Summerset Isles&lt;/a&gt;, thus only the mages themselves and the aristocarcy had access to the use of magic. Archmage &lt;a href=\"Shalidor\"&gt;Shalidor&lt;/a&gt; purportedly classified magic into schools and founded the &lt;a href=\"College%20of%20Winterhold\"&gt;College of Winterhold&lt;/a&gt; to set higher standards among mages and discourage the use of magic among common castes. Despite the dubious nature of these claims, Shalidor did found the College of Winterhold as well as schools of magic. During the early &lt;a href=\"Second%20Era\"&gt;Second Era&lt;/a&gt;, the former Psijic &lt;a href=\"Vanus%20Galerion\"&gt;Vanus Galerion&lt;/a&gt; founded the &lt;a href=\"Mages%20Guild\"&gt;Mages Guild&lt;/a&gt;, a group of mages who worked collectively on magical research, and provided magical services for the public, a revolutionary idea at the time.\nTypes of magic.\nThe schools of magic are classifications of spells that were adopted by the Mages Guild to help beginning spellcasters develop a better understanding of magic by providing a structure that is easy to comprehend. The first known use of the modern schools of magic was by the &lt;a href=\"Shad%20Astula\"&gt;Shad Astula&lt;/a&gt; academy, who devised the system only for the purpose of teaching introductory magic to beginners. The model has proven to be efficient and a petition by &lt;a href=\"Gabrielle%20Benele\"&gt;Gabrielle Benele&lt;/a&gt; was made around &lt;a href=\"2E%20582\"&gt;2E 582&lt;/a&gt; to Vanus Galerion, archmage of the mages guild at the time, to adopt the system into the Mages Guild's study program. The schools of magic devised by Shad Astula include:\nDespite the easily understood structure of the schools, they are considered arbitrary classifications, as magic is an entirely mutable art. Some spells appear to fit into several of these schools, and some of the schools themselves were possibly combined.\nThere are also more obscure forms of magic that have appeared in the series:\nOther arcane arts.\n&lt;a href=\"Powers\"&gt;Powers&lt;/a&gt;.\nPowers are magical effects that can be used by people to produce unique and powerful magical effects. They differ from spells in that Powers have zero\u00a0&lt;a href=\"Magicka\"&gt;Magicka&lt;/a&gt; cost, are not learned from &lt;a href=\"Spell%20Tomes\"&gt;Spell Tomes&lt;/a&gt;, and some can only be used once per day. Different races have their own unique, specific power(s), but all races can gain powers from completing a\u00a0&lt;a href=\"quest\"&gt;quest&lt;/a&gt; for someone, or from various crafted &lt;a href=\"armor\"&gt;armor&lt;/a&gt;,\u00a0&lt;a href=\"clothing\"&gt;clothing&lt;/a&gt; and other &lt;a href=\"apparel\"&gt;apparel&lt;/a&gt;, and/or from unique magical &lt;a href=\"artifacts\"&gt;artifacts&lt;/a&gt;. Basically, while a spell is a learned technique to channel magic, a power is naturally gifted to the user.\n&lt;a href=\"Abilities\"&gt;Abilities/Active Effects&lt;/a&gt;.\nAbilities/Active Effects are magical effects that, once obtained, are constantly active and increase various statistics and values relative to the person who has them. Abilities/Active Effects differ from Powers in that they do not require activation and are not restricted to once-per-day uses like some powers are. Different races have their own unique abilities, but all races can acquire abilities by completing a\u00a0quest for someone, or from\u00a0armor and other\u00a0apparel that was crafted,\u00a0clothes that were made, and/or from unique magical artifacts or relics.\n&lt;a href=\"Enchanting\"&gt;Enchanting&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe art of enchanting involves adding a magical enchantment to a regular item, causing it to have special effects when used. An enchantment is a spell sealed, trapped into an object to confer mystical attributes, which are supported by Souls. To create an enchanted item, one must have an unenchanted item, a soul gem of the desired size, and a specific enchantment that is known and can be placed on the item. Any type of unenchanted item can be enchanted, whether it be &lt;a href=\"weapons\"&gt;weapons&lt;/a&gt;,\u00a0armor,\u00a0clothing\u00a0and/or\u00a0&lt;a href=\"jewelry\"&gt;jewelry&lt;/a&gt;.\n&lt;a href=\"Alchemy\"&gt;Alchemy&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe art of Alchemy does not\u00a0actually use the essence of magicka, but mages and non-mages associate alchemy with the arcane arts and magicka. Alchemy is the study and use of many materials with powers that may influence the flow of magicka in the world.\nAlchemy involves an interface system known as an\u00a0&lt;a href=\"Alchemy%20Lab\"&gt;alchemy lab&lt;/a&gt;, and takes multiple\u00a0&lt;a href=\"ingredients\"&gt;ingredients&lt;/a&gt;\u00a0and mixes them together to create\u00a0&lt;a href=\"potions\"&gt;potions&lt;/a&gt;. Several different parts of an alchemy lab determine the many variables and results of making a potion. A\u00a0&lt;a href=\"mortar%20and%20pestle\"&gt;mortar and pestle&lt;/a&gt;\u00a0is a bowl and grinding tool used for physically and mechanically breaking down alchemical ingredients into powders, pulps or juices used in alchemical operations. A\u00a0&lt;a href=\"retort\"&gt;retort&lt;/a&gt;\u00a0is a vessel with a beaked cap or head used to transform, purify, clean or refine raw ingredients into more refined substances used in alchemical preparations.\nA\u00a0&lt;a href=\"calcinator\"&gt;calcinator&lt;/a&gt;\u00a0is a stove or crucible used to reduce metals and other refined substances to ash so their arcane properties can be separated from the ash. It is also used to increase the magnitude of all known effects of the specific item.\nAn\u00a0&lt;a href=\"alembic\"&gt;alembic&lt;/a&gt;\u00a0is a double glass container in which the arcane properties of raw, refined, arcane, non-arcane and supernatural substances are distilled from their raw ingredients. The materials are infused, then heated until vapor is produced; then, the vapor moves to and condenses in the other container, precipitating the distilled materials with the desired alchemical and magical effects.\nClasses.\nMagic is the specialization of the following playable classes in and :\nIn both games, custom classes can be created which employ magic as a specialization.\nMagic items.\nReality need not be influenced by spell-casting; spells can be imbued into &lt;a href=\"Items\"&gt;objects&lt;/a&gt;. These objects can then be used to influence reality. Imbuing items with magical effects is called \"enchanting.\" Those without magical affinities can still use these objects. Objects imbued with magic often have limited uses, expiring or becoming destroyed when the final charge is used. Few exceptions can be recharged; for example, &lt;a href=\"Enchanted%20Weapons\"&gt;weapons enchanted with magic&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Staff\"&gt;staves&lt;/a&gt;. Armor, clothing, jewelry often bear a &lt;a href=\"constant%20effect\"&gt;constant effect&lt;/a&gt; which never expires. In &lt;a href=\"Cyrodiil\"&gt;Cyrodiil&lt;/a&gt;, members of the &lt;a href=\"Arcane%20University%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;Arcane University&lt;/a&gt; can &lt;a href=\"Enchanting%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;enchant&lt;/a&gt; items using an &lt;a href=\"Altar%20of%20Enchanting\"&gt;Altar of Enchanting&lt;/a&gt;. Citizens of &lt;a href=\"Skyrim\"&gt;Skyrim&lt;/a&gt; enchant using tables known as &lt;a href=\"Arcane%20Enchanter%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Arcane Enchanters&lt;/a&gt;.\nMagical stones.\nMagical stones are naturally occurring, organic substances that possess magical properties. These fall into four categories."}

As you pick effects, other effects from the list may disappear. This is because certain effects would cancel each other out in the same spell. We have taken them out to avoid confusion. To create a spell, left click the Effects field with your mouse. You will get a pick list from which you can pick different effects. Once you select an effect, another pop up box will appear, asking you to enter ranges, numbers, percentages, or perhaps all three. Enter the appropriate data you wish for your particular spell. At the bottom of the pop up box you will see the current cost for the spell you are designing. This is the cost in gold for that particular effect. Leaving this box by clicking the exit will print a brief summary of what you selected on the parchment, and the total cost of the spell can be seen next to the Spell Cost field. If this is confusing, don't worry, we have provided an example.\nExample 1: Creating a spell in the Spell Maker.\nSteps to create a Fireball spell: Items can be selected by double left clicking with the mouse.\nYou should be back at the Spell Maker parchment.\nYou will be given a choice to Add, Modify, or Delete an effect on a spell. Remember, keep an eye on both the Spell Cost (gold) and the Casting Cost (spell points). It's that simple! If you now look on the Spell Maker parchment you will see under 'Effects:',\nA word about Spell Points:\nKeep an eye on the Casting Cost displayed on the Spellmaker sheet. This tells you how many spell points it takes for you at your current level to cast this spell. With the exception of Sorcerers, the most spell points a mage can ever have is 200. If the number in this field is above that, you cannot cast the spell displayed. This is not to say that you will never be able to cast it. As you rise in levels, the Casting Cost will drop. This is just to make sure you understand that at your current level you cannot cast this spell."}

There are three types of runes in the base game: Fire (orange), Frost (bluish-white), and Shock (whitish-purple). The expansion adds three more: Ash (brown), Frenzy (red), and Poison (green). When cast, the spells take about a second to charge up, then they can be \"thrown\" on either the ground or wall, creating a circle with magic symbols. They can be shot at with a projectile spell or &lt;a href=\"Shout\"&gt;Shout&lt;/a&gt; to manually trigger them. The &lt;a href=\"Destruction%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Destruction&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Perks%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;perk&lt;/a&gt; \"&lt;a href=\"Rune%20Master\"&gt;Rune Master&lt;/a&gt;\" allows the caster to throw runes 5 times farther. Only one rune can be placed at a time. Attempting to place another while a rune is already in place will cause the previous rune to disappear. &lt;a href=\"Dual%20Wielding\"&gt;Dual casting&lt;/a&gt; a rune will boost its damage by double.\nRunes are particularly useful in dealing with hibernating or entombed &lt;a href=\"Draugr%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;draugr&lt;/a&gt; or other enemies behind sealed doors or barriers. If a draugr is sleeping or dormant but still alive, casting a rune next to it will cause the rune to explode, heavily damaging, or killing the draugr. Runes cast as close as possible to sealed coffins or sarcophagi will also explode if the draugr inside is alive, not only hurting it but possibly triggering a premature emergence. Draugr and other undesirables behind sealed doors can also be injured this way, or even killed if they are trapped with no way they can release the doors.\nRunes can also be set as traps for enemies in another room; casting the rune in a doorway or hall and then getting the enemy's attention via &lt;a href=\"Throw%20Voice\"&gt;Throw Voice&lt;/a&gt; or projectiles (&lt;a href=\"Arrows%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;arrows&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Firebolt%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Firebolt&lt;/a&gt;, etc.) so they investigate and step on the rune. Runes can also be used in active combat with melee-oriented enemies, by casting a rune near the player and letting the enemy step in it. Runes can also act as an escape tool, casting them when fleeing a powerful enemy, like &lt;a href=\"Giant%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Giants&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"Draugr%20Death%20Overlord\"&gt;Draugr Death Overlord&lt;/a&gt;s.\nFire Rune.\nFire Rune is an &lt;a href=\"Rank\"&gt;\"Apprentice\"-level&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Destruction%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Destruction&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Spell%20Tomes%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;spell&lt;/a&gt; in . Casting it causes blobs of fire to shoot from the hands and stick to surfaces. When a target steps on or passes too closely to a Fire Rune, it explodes, causing 50 points of &lt;a href=\"Fire%20Damage%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;fire damage&lt;/a&gt;. Enemies caught on fire from the spell take additional damage. An alternate way of casting a Fire Rune is to use a bash with the &lt;a href=\"Dawnguard%20Rune%20Hammer\"&gt;Dawnguard Rune Hammer&lt;/a&gt;, using Stamina instead of Magicka. The symbol includes the runic letter 'F'.\nFrost Rune.\nFrost Rune is an \"Apprentice\"-level Destruction spell in \"Skyrim\". Casting it causes blobs of ice to shoot from the hands and stick to surfaces. When a target steps on or passes too closely to a Frost Rune, it explodes, causing 50 points of &lt;a href=\"Frost%20Damage%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;frost damage&lt;/a&gt;. Frozen enemies have hindered speed. The symbol includes the runic letter 'S'.\nLightning Rune.\nLightning Rune is an \"Apprentice\"-level Destruction spell in \"Skyrim\". Casting it causes sparks of lightning to shoot from the hands and stick to surfaces. When a target steps on or passes too closely to a Shock Rune, it explodes, causing 50 points of &lt;a href=\"Shock%20Damage%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;shock damage&lt;/a&gt;. \"Shocked\" enemies have hindered magicka. The symbol includes the runic letter 'L'.\nAsh Rune.\n&lt;a href=\"Ash%20Rune\"&gt;Ash Rune&lt;/a&gt; is an &lt;a href=\"Rank\"&gt;\"Expert\"-level&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Alteration%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Alteration&lt;/a&gt; spell in .\nIt causes ash to shoot out of the caster's hands and cling to the nearest surface. When enemies come into contact with it, it explodes, immobilizing all in a small burst for 30 seconds. Unlike paralysis, affected targets cannot be attacked. This symbol includes the runic letter 'T' and what appears similar--though not identical--to the runic letter 'H'.\nPoison Rune.\n&lt;a href=\"Poison%20Rune\"&gt;Poison Rune&lt;/a&gt; is an &lt;a href=\"Rank\"&gt;\"Adept\"-level&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Restoration%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Restoration&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Spells%20%28Dragonborn%29\"&gt;spell&lt;/a&gt; in \"Dragonborn\".\nCasting it will cause a poison spell to shoot out, and stick to a nearby surface. When a target comes into contact with it, it will explode, causing 3 points of poison damage for 30 seconds. (i.e. 90 points of poison damage) This symbol includes the runic letter 'I'.\nFrenzy Rune.\n&lt;a href=\"Frenzy%20Rune\"&gt;Frenzy Rune&lt;/a&gt; is an \"Adept\"-level &lt;a href=\"Illusion%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Illusion&lt;/a&gt; spell in \"Dragonborn\".\nCasting it will cause a &lt;a href=\"Frenzy%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Frenzy&lt;/a&gt; spell to shoot out, and stick to a nearby surface. When a target comes into contact with it, it will explode causing all nearby creatures, up to level 20 to frenzy, attacking anyone nearby. This benefits from all Illusion perks, increasing the level of foes it can affect. This symbol includes the runic letter 'N'."}

The people know these fragments as 'shooting stars', and from time to time, such Aetherial fragments are found on Nirn. The most common varieties are known as 'meteoric iron'; this metal is prized by armorers and enchanters for its properties in the forging of enchanted weapons and armors.

No ritual or arcane knowledge is necessary, suggesting that these wells were designed to serve persons not skilled in the magical arts. Once drained, the wells replenish again only at magical midnight. Once recharged, they appear to radiate magical power back into the sky, which prompts some to theorize they are also objects with religious or magical ritual significance -- perhaps a means of offering magic back to the heavens.\nWelkynd Stones [&lt;a href=\"Aldmeris\"&gt;Aldmeris&lt;/a&gt; - \"sky stone,\" \"heaven stone\"; literally, \"sky child\"] are pieces of cut and enchanted meteoric glass which apparently act as storage devices for magical power. A magical talent can restore his reservoirs of magicka from such stones. Alas, the means of restoring power to these stones may have been lost with the Ayleids. Currently, these objects simply crumble to dust after they have been used.\n&lt;a href=\"Great%20Welkynd%20Stone\"&gt;Great Welkynd Stone&lt;/a&gt;s are exceptionally large pieces of enchanted meteoric glass. Scholars believe that at the heart of each ancient Ayleid city, a Great Welkynd Stone was the source of the settlement's magical enchantments. It may be that these great stones were linked to the lesser stones, restoring and maintaining their power. In any case, research on these Great Welkynd Stones is impossible, since all the known &lt;a href=\"Ayleid%20ruins\"&gt;Ayleid ruins&lt;/a&gt; have been looted of their great stones, and no examples of these great stones are known to survive.\nAnother rare enchanted item found in Ayleid ruins is called a Varla Stone [Aldmeris - \"star stone\"]. Varla Stones are remarkably powerful, enabling untrained users to restore magical energy to any number of enchanted items. Because of their great value and utility, these items are also extremely rare, but since they are small and easily concealed, diligent explorers may still occasionally come across them in any ruin.\nAyleid Wells. Welkynd Stones. Varla Stones. Consider, then, these marvels of magical enchantment. Are we then to conclude that the Ayleids were a superior race and culture? Did they so exceed us in art and craft that they mock the feeble powers of &lt;a href=\"Third%20Era\"&gt;Third Era&lt;/a&gt; Wizards?\nNever! The Ayleids were powerful, yes, and cunning, but they were neither good nor wise, and so they were struck down. Their works have passed from Nirn, save these rare and sparkling treasures. Their ancient cities are dark and empty, save for the grim revenants and restless spirits condemned forever to walk the halls, keeping their melancholy vigils over bones and dust."}

Once recharged, they appear to radiate magical power back into the sky, which prompts some to theorize they are also objects with religious or magical ritual significance\u2014perhaps a means of offering magic back to the heavens.\nWelkynd Stones (in &lt;a href=\"Aldmeris\"&gt;Aldmeris&lt;/a&gt;: \"sky stone,\" \"heaven stone,\" or literally, \"sky child\") are pieces of cut and enchanted meteoric glass which apparently act as storage devices for magical power. A magical talent can restore his reservoirs of magicka from such stones. Alas, the means of restoring power to these stones may have been lost with the Ayleids. Currently, these objects simply crumble to dust after they have been used.\n&lt;a href=\"Great%20Welkynd%20Stone\"&gt;Great Welkynd Stone&lt;/a&gt;s are exceptionally large pieces of enchanted meteoric glass. Scholars believe that at the heart of each ancient Ayleid city, a Great Welkynd Stone was the source of the settlement's magical enchantments. It may be that these great stones were linked to the lesser stones, restoring and maintaining their power. In any case, research on these Great Welkynd Stones is impossible, since all the known &lt;a href=\"Ayleid%20Ruins%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Ayleid ruins&lt;/a&gt; have been looted of their great stones, and no examples of these great stones are known to survive.\nAnother rare enchanted item found in Ayleid ruins is called a Varla Stone (Aldmeris - \"star stone\"). Varla Stones are remarkably powerful, enabling untrained users to restore magical energy to any number of enchanted items. Because of their great value and utility, these items are also extremely rare, but since they are small and easily concealed, diligent explorers may still occasionally come across them in any Ayleid ruin.\nAyleid Wells. Welkynd Stones. Varla Stones. Consider, then, these marvels of magical enchantment. Are we then to conclude that the Ayleids were a superior race and culture? Did they so exceed us in art and craft that they mock the feeble powers of &lt;a href=\"Second%20Era\"&gt;Second Era&lt;/a&gt; Wizards?\nNever! The Ayleids were powerful, yes, and cunning, but they were neither good nor wise, and so they were struck down. Their works have passed from Nirn, save these rare and sparkling treasures. Their ancient cities are dark and empty, save for the grim revenants and restless spirits condemned forever to walk the halls, keeping their melancholy vigils over bones and dust."}

It has exactly the same purpose that magicka in and does, and that is being the resource used to cast magic albeit with a few, but major differences.\nDuring gameplay, magicka is displayed as the blue bar underneath the player's red health bar, and above the green stamina bar. One critical difference between magicka in and the newer \"Elder Scrolls\" games is that it does not regenerate naturally by any means, and the only main way to restore depleted/used magicka is to rest (not wait). Restoring magicka through resting functions the same way restoring health does, with a proportionally larger wait time required for a larger magicka pool.\nAdditionally, magicka may be restored by drinking restore Magicka &lt;a href=\"Potions%20%28Morrowind%29\"&gt;potions&lt;/a&gt; or using &lt;a href=\"Scrolls%20%28Morrowind%29\"&gt;scrolls&lt;/a&gt; which absorb magicka from enemy spellcasters; however, these potions can be somewhat uncommon, and quite difficult for beginning magic-user characters to get.\nThe lack of in-combat magicka regeneration in makes utilizing magic effectively without constant and tedious resting quite difficult if not impossible, as spells can have a very high magicka cost and many dungeons and indoor combat prevents the player from resting due to the presence of enemies.\nSeveral &lt;a href=\"Birthsigns%20%28Morrowind%29\"&gt;birthsigns&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Races%20%28Morrowind%29\"&gt;race&lt;/a&gt; choices affect magicka. &lt;a href=\"Bretons%20%28Morrowind%29\"&gt;Bretons&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Altmer%20%28Morrowind%29\"&gt;Altmers&lt;/a&gt; gain an innate bonus multiplier to their magicka (x0.5 and x1.5 respectively), stacking with any bonuses from birthsigns.\nAdditionally, Bretons, Altmers, &lt;a href=\"Argonians%20%28Morrowind%29\"&gt;Argonians&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Dunmer%20%28Morrowind%29\"&gt;Dunmer&lt;/a&gt; have innate skill bonuses to several schools of magic, making them ideal magicka users.\nMaximum magicka (the amount of magicka actively available for use by the player) is determined this way:\u00a0 your total Magicka is determined by multiplying your &lt;a href=\"Intelligence%20%28Morrowind%29\"&gt;Intelligence&lt;/a&gt; by your base Magicka Multiplier, which is 1 by default.

According to the lore, magicka is not from the very &lt;a href=\"Mage%20%28Class%29\"&gt;mage&lt;/a&gt;, but is found in the natural environment and the mage himself uses it. The source of magicka is mysterious, but the majority of arcane scholars explain that this power flows through the stars from &lt;a href=\"Aetherius\"&gt;Aetherius&lt;/a&gt; into &lt;a href=\"Mundus\"&gt;Mundus&lt;/a&gt;, which explains regeneration and use of magicka in &lt;a href=\"Ayleid\"&gt;Ayleid&lt;/a&gt; structures. Others perceive as recycled life-force, which accumulates in the ambient, being fabric of souls. This explains the connection to using soul gems in Enchanting, however.\nMechanics.\nMagicka is the total amount of 'magic points' or MP a character can spend to cast spells. Each spell requires a certain number of Magicka to cast. If the character has insufficient Magicka the spell icon is grayed out and cannot be cast. A character who runs out of Magicka is not adversely affected in any other way. A spell is the process of converting magicka into a physical interaction.\nRaising magicka.\nThe primary way to permanently raise Magicka is to raise the character's &lt;a href=\"Intelligence%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;Intelligence&lt;/a&gt; score when leveling up. The primary way to permanently raise the regeneration rate of Magicka is to raise the character's &lt;a href=\"Willpower%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;Willpower&lt;/a&gt; score when leveling up.\nThere are numerous &lt;a href=\"Blessings%20of%20the%20Gods\"&gt;blessings&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Spells%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;spells&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Potions%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;potions&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Items%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;items&lt;/a&gt; which can temporarily raise the Magicka total or increase a character's &lt;a href=\"Intelligence%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;Intelligence&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Willpower%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;Willpower&lt;/a&gt; attributes and thus the Magicka maximum and regeneration rates, respectively. &lt;a href=\"Enchanting%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;Enchanted items&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Diseases%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;conditions&lt;/a&gt; such as &lt;a href=\"Vampirism%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;vampirism&lt;/a&gt; can offer boosts to Magicka until they are &lt;a href=\"Cure%20Disease%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;cured&lt;/a&gt; or removed.\nLowering magicka.\nThe primary way of losing Magicka is, of course, to use it. However, there are many effects which can temporarily reduce a character's Magicka total or regeneration rate, usually by targeting said character's &lt;a href=\"Intelligence%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;Intelligence&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"Willpower%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;Willpower&lt;/a&gt;. There are also some effects that drain Magicka points as if they had been spent. Character archetypes that have an extreme approach toward magic (either eschewing it completely, as with the pure melee fighter, or by specializing in having as much of it as possible, as with the pure spellcaster) often have the least trouble with Magicka-draining effects. Character archetypes that depend upon having Magicka for a key ability or concept (such as a Battlemage or any custom class that relies upon magic for a strong first or last strike) have much to fear from such effects. It is notable, however, in that a pack of monsters with Magicka-draining effects can be a deadly threat to any character build."}

Magicka Surge allows the &lt;a href=\"Fugitive%20%28Blades%29\"&gt;Fugitive&lt;/a&gt; to cast multiple spells in conjunction, due to the significantly increased magicka regeneration, as well as the cooldown reduction for the spell.\nUsage.\nPaired up with the proper spells, Magicka Surge can prove to be devastating for the enemies. The Fugitive can use it to cast spells that would not normally deal much damage a number of times, as along with the inability to interrupt them and their decreased cooldowns, the enemy will be significantly hurt. Casting impairing spells like &lt;a href=\"Ice%20Spike%20%28Blades%29\"&gt;Ice Spike&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"Paralyze%20%28Blades%29\"&gt;Paralyze&lt;/a&gt;, it is possible to kill the enemy before the surge ends. Casting a &lt;a href=\"Lightning%20Bolt%20%28Blades%29\"&gt;Lightning Bolt&lt;/a&gt; spell rapidly can be useful enough to drain enemies that resist poison, fire and frost damage until the surge over. But while casting &lt;a href=\"Fireball%20%28Blades%29\"&gt;Fireball&lt;/a&gt;, it is possible to burn an enemy that resists all elemental types except for fire damage before the end of the Magicka Surge. While casting a &lt;a href=\"Blind%20%28Blades%29\"&gt;Blind&lt;/a&gt; spell a lot, can make any enemy that does not resist venomous attacks blinded for long as the surge goes on. It is important to have &lt;a href=\"Resist%20Elements\"&gt;Resist Elements&lt;/a&gt; casted even during the surge whatever any elemental condition the caster has suffered or not, so that the Fugitive would not be enervated by the opponent's shocking attacks.\nAfter the surge ends, magicka will drop to 0, so it is important that the Fugitive is making use of spells, &lt;a href=\"Abilities%20%28Blades%29\"&gt;abilities&lt;/a&gt; or weapons that the enemy is weak to when activating Magicka Surge. That way, the damage dealt will be maximized and the drawbacks of the spell can be avoided."}

Wouldn't that be a discovery for the ages!\n&lt;a href=\"Sun%27s%20Height\"&gt;Sun's Height&lt;/a&gt;.3\nThe small scale experiment finally yielded results.

If it affects them negatively, might that offset any benefit? Sustainability is the issue. How to solve?\n&lt;a href=\"Calendar%23Hearthfire\"&gt;Hearthfire&lt;/a&gt;.17\nI forced myself to show some humility today.

With a few more year of experimentation, I might be able to devise a stabilizing ward for the prism, but when dealing with tonal magics, you'll find no better tools than those left behind by the Dwemer.\nHearthfire 19\nThat pompous ass &lt;a href=\"Magister%20Gothren%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Gothren&lt;/a&gt; was feigning interest in my work. He must have a spy somewhere in &lt;a href=\"Sadrith%20Mora%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Sadrith Mora&lt;/a&gt;, or even among the staff in my tower. His questions were pointed.

I'd best keep more detailed information where it won't be seen by curious eyes or nosy spies.\n&lt;a href=\"Sun%27s%20Dusk\"&gt;Sun's Dusk&lt;/a&gt;.21\nAt last! I finally managed to install the Dwemer stabilizer. The kwama constantly bumble into it. Damned bugs. I doubt that a misconfiguration would cause too much trouble, but when dealing with a priceless tonal prism, caution is warranted.\n&lt;a href=\"Evening%20Star\"&gt;Evening Star&lt;/a&gt;.14\nThat idiot girl Ana, Arolenda, Arowende. She wandered into my lab at Mzanchend, excited about some discovery within the place and was only carrying the crank. She set the other fastening tools down while she took notes. She's smart, but bloody absentminded. I shall make her retrieve the items, I am not traipsing around the entire ruin, sorting through bits and pieces to find the other three pieces of the machine lock.

She is the region's primary antagonist.\nBackground.\nOnce a prominent member of &lt;a href=\"House%20Dres%20%28Online%29\"&gt;House Dres&lt;/a&gt; and a loyal servant of the &lt;a href=\"Tribunal%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Tribunal&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Almalexia%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Almalexia&lt;/a&gt; took away her son &lt;a href=\"Meram%20Vox\"&gt;Meram Vox&lt;/a&gt; when he infiltrated the &lt;a href=\"Tribunal%20Temple%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Tribunal Temple&lt;/a&gt;, killed many Temple members, and tried to steal &lt;a href=\"Veloth%27s%20Judgement%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Veloth's Judgement&lt;/a&gt; for the &lt;a href=\"Daedric%20Prince\"&gt;Daedric Prince&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Boethiah\"&gt;Boethiah&lt;/a&gt;. Dispensing her own justice, Almalexia executed Meram in front of Urili for treason against the ruling Tribunal and killing innocent lives.\nLater hearing the same whispers of Boethiah that the Daedric Prince had told her son, she swore vengeance on the Tribunal and wove an intricate plot to topple the Three's rule and bring back the blessings of Boethiah and the Anticipations back to &lt;a href=\"Morrowind%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Morrowind&lt;/a&gt;. Vox formed the &lt;a href=\"Maulborn\"&gt;Maulborn&lt;/a&gt;, and with &lt;a href=\"Merdyndril\"&gt;Merdyndril&lt;/a&gt;, she created the &lt;a href=\"Llodos%20Plague\"&gt;Llodos Plague&lt;/a&gt; and set it out upon &lt;a href=\"Deshaan%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Deshaan&lt;/a&gt; in order to weaken support for the Tribunal.\nInteractions.\n&lt;a href=\"The%20Llodos%20Plague%20%28Quest%29\"&gt;The Llodos Plague&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Vestige\"&gt;Vestige&lt;/a&gt; first encounters the Maulborn threat on the road south to Deshaan, where the organization's members are posing as philanthropists handing out a cure for the &lt;a href=\"Llodos%20Plague\"&gt;Llodos Plague&lt;/a&gt;, which in reality is the source of the plague.\nIn Serkamora, also known as the &lt;a href=\"Quarantine%20Serk\"&gt;Serk&lt;/a&gt;, the Maulborn have quarantined most of the local Dunmer inside the village's walls. Contrary to their promise of a cure, it is here where the Maulborn are experimenting on the afflicted in order to further enhance the plague. In Narsis, Maulborn agents kidnapped villagers and killed them, then injected the Llodos Plague into their bodies to allow it to fester and intensify. The Vestige was able to stop their plans to infect the local water supply with the Plague.\nIn Obsidian Gorge, Maulborn agents attempted to smuggle crates filled with Plague vials into &lt;a href=\"Mournhold%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Mournhold&lt;/a&gt;, but House Hlaalu soldiers and the Vestige were able to stop them and kill Merdyndril, the creator of the plague, thus denying Vox the use of the Plague.\nStealing the Judgement of Veloth.\nVox then had her agents capture a Telvanni mage and use her to reactivate &lt;a href=\"Daedric\"&gt;Daedric&lt;/a&gt; wards in the Mournhold sewers, allowing her operatives to move about the city's underbelly undetected by the Tribunal. This led to Maulborn agents infiltrating the Tribunal Temple and opening Daedric portals within. Almalexia employed the Vestige to cleanse the Temple, but they arrived too late to stop Vox's agents from stealing the &lt;a href=\"Veloth%27s%20Judgement%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Judgement of Veloth&lt;/a&gt;, a powerful artifact that allowed Vox to steal souls from those the Judgement killed, increasing her power with each kill.\n&lt;a href=\"Selfora\"&gt;Selfora&lt;/a&gt;.\nVox moved east from Mournhold to a small village named Selfora. There, she attempted to recruit more followers to her cause. When the people refused, she became enraged and unleashed her newfound power, obliterating a large portion of the town and causing all those she killed to return as restless spirits who attacked any who came near the town. She left an Echo of herself behind to ensure she wasn't followed, but the Vestige, sent by Almalexia to pursue Vox, destroyed it and released the spirits.\n&lt;a href=\"Shrine%20of%20Saint%20Veloth\"&gt;Shrine of Saint Veloth&lt;/a&gt;.\nNext, Vox moved North to the Shrine of Saint Veloth, where she destroyed the Shrine and opened multiple Daedric portals. Saint Veloth's spirit requested the Vestige's aid to rebuild his Shrine and restore his strength. Once this was done, Saint Veloth bestowed his blessing upon the Vestige, which protected them from the Judgement's power.\n&lt;a href=\"Eidolon%27s%20Hollow\"&gt;Eidolon's Hollow&lt;/a&gt;.\nWith her Maulborn being defeated all across Deshaan, Vox gathered all her remaining forces at the Daedric ruins of Eidolon's Hollow, supplemented by summoned Daedra. Shortly after a force of Ordinators under &lt;a href=\"Ordinator%20Muron\"&gt;Ordinator Muron&lt;/a&gt; arrived and surrounded Vox's forces, with the Vestige clearing a path for the Tribunal forces. The Vestige fought through the ruins and confronted Vox at her inner sanctum. There she struck them down with the Judgement, unaware of the protection of the blessing of Saint Veloth. Once within the Judgement's Reservoir of Souls, the Vestige was able to destroy the Reservoir and release the souls within. Vox confronted the Vestige but was swiftly defeated without the power of the Judgement to aid her."}

Whereas Magnus tore a hole through &lt;a href=\"Oblivion%20%28Realm%29\"&gt;Oblivion&lt;/a&gt; into Aetherius which later became the sun, the Magne Ge tore smaller holes which became the stars. The Magna Ge are now synonymous with the stars which they had created. Some say what is left of Magnus on the world is felt and controlled by mortals as magic.\nAccording to &lt;a href=\"Mankar%20Camoran\"&gt;Mankar Camoran&lt;/a&gt;, they are attributed to secretly creating &lt;a href=\"Mehrunes%20Dagon\"&gt;Mehrunes Dagon&lt;/a&gt; in the bowels of &lt;a href=\"Lyg\"&gt;Lyg&lt;/a&gt;.\nMnemoli.\nThe Mnemoli are a group of Magna-Ge which some believe had the specific task of writing the &lt;a href=\"Elder%20Scrolls\"&gt;Elder Scrolls&lt;/a&gt; and thereby deciding how history will play out. They collect the \"songs\" created by the music of &lt;a href=\"Nirn\"&gt;Nirn&lt;/a&gt; and shape them into realities, distributing these realities in the Elder Scrolls as possible realities. These possible realities must then ultimately be validated by the Hero-Event function, in which a Hero helps the Event come to pass. However, this is in direct contradiction with what the book &lt;a href=\"Pension%20of%20the%20Ancestor%20Moth\"&gt;Pension of the Ancestor Moth&lt;/a&gt; says about the Scrolls and their connection with the &lt;a href=\"Et%27Ada\"&gt;Et'Ada&lt;/a&gt;. By partaking in the creation of Nirn, the Mnemoli became Aedra. And as the aforementioned book says, the Elder Scrolls \"exceed both &lt;a href=\"Aedra\"&gt;Aedra&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Daedra\"&gt;Daedra&lt;/a&gt;\", making it impossible for the Mnemoli to have written the Elder Scrolls. This is also supported by dialogue with &lt;a href=\"Paarthurnax\"&gt;Paarthurnax&lt;/a&gt; before reading the &lt;a href=\"Elder%20Scroll%20%28Dragon%29\"&gt;Elder Scroll (Dragon)&lt;/a&gt; he says \"The Very Bones of the earth are at your disposal.\" According to lore some Et'Ada became &lt;a href=\"Ehlnofey\"&gt;Ehlnofey&lt;/a&gt; and some Ehlnofey became the metaphorical bones of the earth."}

In reality, it was the traitor &lt;a href=\"Lieutenant%20Lein-Barduik\"&gt;Lieutenant Lein-Barduik&lt;/a&gt; who stole the identity of &lt;a href=\"Proconsul%20Beloren-Kaie\"&gt;Proconsul Beloren-Kaie&lt;/a&gt;, the true next of kin, after he fell to a &lt;a href=\"Morag%20Tong\"&gt;Morag Tong&lt;/a&gt;'s assassin blade. Decades later, when the Magnate preformed the &lt;a href=\"Proving%20Festival\"&gt;Proving Festival&lt;/a&gt;'s call to her ancestors, the Proconsul responded and judged her according to their traditions to be unworthy, kidnapping her and resurrecting the spirits of the &lt;a href=\"Hakoshae%20Tombs\"&gt;Hakoshae Tombs&lt;/a&gt;.

She accepts, and prostrates herself before the entire town, who despite it all, still overwhelmingly admire her and ask that she remain their leader. Gratefully, she says that she will stay for as long as the people will have her, and will do her best to help the town however she can."}
{"id": "516928", "revid": "32911304", "url": "https://elderscrolls.fandom.com/wiki?curid=516928", "title": "Magne-Ge Pantheon", "text": "Here is the pantheon of the &lt;a href=\"Magna%20Ge\"&gt;Magne-Ge&lt;/a&gt;, as documented by the ancient Master Redshift, the first of its denizens who persisted enough with fitness to map the in-between heavens. This pantheon is made up of the Filters, Chromes, Penumbras, and Capricious Glows that influence the day-by-may fortunes of the myriad creatures that play among the Magne-Ge\u2019s many-and-shattered floating untimes. All of them are days that may.\nEvery spectrum in the Magne-Ge, large or small, abides by Redshift\u2019s teachings and his Catalog of Radiance. Moreso, the packets of the Magne-Ge regard these beings, in optic, as a framework by which to measure their own perhaps-it-mays in the Grand Schism of Things. Who can blame them, really, after the Breaking changed everything except for the suns?\nLong ago, the cultures of the Magne-Ge gave these heavenly heroes and miscreants a stewardship over their own fates and fortunes: as constellations and &lt;a href=\"birth%20signs\"&gt;birth signs&lt;/a&gt; that would inspire their actions and true accordance evermore.\nThus does this pantheon affect all of the Untime Folk, from the Blue Mountain to the Vapor Lamp to the Wiggle-room Convene and even the Multimund beyond.\nThe one exception to this tradition comes from the &lt;a href=\"Tsaesci\"&gt;Tsaesci&lt;/a&gt;, whose subdermal culture enjoys no birth sign, an issue that will be touched upon never.\nC Signs.\nThe Spirits of C, for reasons lost to us now, share the traits of disaster and displacement. The Breaking is central to the tales told of them, when &lt;a href=\"Merid\"&gt;Merid&lt;/a&gt; Herself held fast against the erasure of the Magne-Ge without success.\nThose born under the Signs of the C are rigid in their thinking and cautious in all approach. Their constellations are dim and indistinct.\nBare Bone (C Sign) \u2013 Before the Breaking, Bare Bone was a Handmaiden of great Merid Who Held the Whole of the Blackblock Under Her Hood. Bare Bone\u2019s provinces were agriculture and the cultivation of the good soil. But then the Thermal-Talk came, bringing the War of C and M, its aftermath resulting in the taint of all Y. Bare Bone vanished just after the War ended, abandoning the surface worlds and going underground.\nNil-Bright (C Sign) \u2013 Proud, stubborn Nil-Bright the Nix watches over the borders of Y, snort-and-fiber-ready to do combat with those powers that would wish it further ill. This has been his domain ever since the Breaking. Others whisper that Nil-Bright had a different station before now, as a misguided Crusader of the Chrome Device, but these accusations have been dismissed by lay and learned alike. Nil-Bright is the twin of AgNil-Bright of K and the father of Nil-Nthi, a Color Spirit of The Pigment Truce.\nWode-Rub (C Sign) \u2013 A compound Color of rare aspect, the Wode-Rub is now synonymous with the doom of Newish Ideas. Before the Dawning, Merid attempted to fuse the carnivorous and herbivorous principles into one, so that the Harmony might always dwell in the cultures of the Magne-Ge. This particular idea could not last long, biting and running from itself in near-constant conflict. In the end, the Spirit of the Wode-Rub was condemned, downward, into the depths of the utter black by the Harmony, frozen in an eternal, hungry struggle. The highly-prized color called W is all that remains.\nPigmius (C Sign) \u2013 Scant moments before the Y Blur, Merid commanded that a great Border be fashioned from the Blackblock. Pigmius was the result. In his right hand, he held the Canvas of his sister Mnethm; in his left hand he refused to hold anything except the Lens in his finger veins. Pigmius could not hold back the Monster Legions of the Chrome Device and the foul enchantments of the Y. He was finally undone by the Fiberings of Nana Null. His legacy and promise can still be reclaimed in the gathering and refinement of the Pigment.\nBLEND SIGNS.\nThe Spirits of Blend are on the rise. The heavens swirl around them now for reasons unknown. Though the invisible Lens Spirits are more vibrant, in contrast to all others connected to the Blackblock, it is Blend that enjoys the most prosperity and affluence in these days.\nThe birth signs of Blend are the eldest in the known spheres. Those born under their mark are nomadic, whimsical, and greatly given to freaking out.\nTheir constellations are difficult to process in manner of movement, triangulation, and high frequency.\nScintil (Blend Sign) - Before the Breaking, Scintil was the Messenger of great Merid Who Held the Whole of the Blackblock Under Her Hood. Though impulsive as an adolescent, and much given to traveling only at night, Scintil nevertheless guided all the Spirits of the Magne-Ge in their various trials, imparting her divide-the-line wisdom wherever she could. After the devastation wrought by the War of C and M, and its aftermath, the Y Blur, Scintil withdrew from her station, taking a hammock into the unfettered eddies of the Blend. She eventually became a Color of The Pigment Truce.\nCaker King (Blend Sign) \u2013 The savannahs and jungles of Ut Cyr are lost to us now by the machinations of unknown Towers. Caker King was a mighty Tiger in those days. As such, he ruled a Principality that invited the rest of the Great Cats into the Den of the Hiss-and-Bite-Accord, a tradition now copied to different effect by the similarly-vanished March of Snakes. The royal stations of Great Cats have long-since become lost in the annals of celestial treaty. Caker King\u2019s Tiger aspect is today only fashioned as a Stone-Leap of his last majestic hunting.\nSwath (Blend Sign) \u2013 Her original name hidden in mystery, Swath is the Blend Spirit of merry-making and the hallucinogenic admixture of sensations found in the esoteric realm of synesthesia. Swath governs the domains of eccentric artisans, painters, and blind musicians. Those born under her sign are often freckled or greatly given to checkered patterns in their cloth. Her demimemberdress daughter, Nelley-Bright the Princess of Kflies, does not yet enjoy a place among the Magne-Ge pantheon, but the Wise say that her inconstant lantern-lights will usher in a new and more beautiful order.\nDaubella (Blend Sign) \u2013 The youngest (or oldest) of the Blend Signs and the one most likely given to aid newcomers because of it, Daubella is more of a concept than a Color proper. It should be known that this assertion has come under attack by the fault-philosophers of the Magne-Ge. Some say that Daubella is the most important constellation of all, at least for now; that her issue includes Grey Could, Mud That Might, and the Non-Nymic That Helps. Others declare that the Magne-Ge lay under a spell of Daubella\u2019s own invention, with her true role being merely another avatar of Nana Null.\nK Signs.\nThe Spirits of K are young and ferocious. They have not yet understood their place in the Magne-Ge. That last statement is not entirely correct. There are reports, fortified by Redshift\u2019s own findings, that some K Spirits actually enjoyed an existence prior to the current forms; more so, that these Spirits harbor secrets that they are still unwilling (or plainly refuse) to paint of.\nThose born under the Signs of K are spontaneous and gleeful in the face of danger. Their constellations are the brightest ever to be found in the firmament, ablaze with vigorous, if dangerous, purpose.\nThermall\u00e9l\u00e9 (K Sign) \u2013 The tale of Thermall\u00e9l\u00e9 is a strange one. Redshift\u2019s records of this Spirit are incomplete. It has taken many names across many Patterns. It was once the Thermalu, the wicked Spirit of Blend, who sent perplexing messages to all other wheels for agendas unknown. It has also been called ThermalThermalThermalbok, the malignant Spirit of M that ate Folk at ley-tide. Most famously, Thermall\u00e9l\u00e9 was once Thermal-Talk, the fiery and palette-fearing Spirit of C that chased away Bare Bone, the Spirit of agriculture and cultivation. In every single manifestation, the Thermal Spirit seems bent on trickery and deception. The Wise say that Thermall\u00e9l\u00e9, in whatsoever form, is always the current antithesis of Progress, its wiles and wherefores sent by the Chrome Device and, by extension, Nana Null.\nAgNil-Bright (K Sign) \u2013 AgNil-Bright is the Fearless K, who burns against all Monsters and associated Powers that would threaten any of the Untime Folk. AgNil-Bright is a younger Spirit, and much given to reckless abandon. Often, he burns the belongings of those he has sworn to protect in his fighting, and is always sorry for it. He is the twin of Nil-Bright of C and uncle to Nil-Nthi, Color Spirit of The Pigment Truce.\nClan Box (K Sign) - Before the Breaking, Clan Box was the Court Jester of great Merid Who Held the Whole of the Blackblock Under Her Hood. His sphere today is as the Fickle K, who changes minds and moods in erratic fashion. More importantly, Clan Box habitually misdirects those ideas too soon coming to fruition. His son is Clan Box 2, the Emission Color of The Pigment Truce.\nMnethm (K Sign) \u2013 Mnethm is the Fortified K, the fount of inspiration. Why her temples are found mostly underground is a riddle for the Sep Thing. Mnethm governs the domain of motivation, especially in engineering and scientific discovery. In this role, she finds herself regularly contested by the Thermal Spirit, who would halt all ideas of Progress, and Clan Box, who manically scrutinizes Mnethm\u2019s inventions for any potential buzz-kill to the Magne-Ge\u2019s effervescent frolicking.\nM Signs.\nThe Spirits of M were once willful but rash, and in the whole they were almost always irresponsible. They could bend all other Patterns, save for the invisible Powers of Lens, to their relentless lines and dreams and form-felts, though it might take an eruption or three.\nMerid stopped such bullishness when she was cast out by the Chrome Device Her Father. To the surprise of many, the M Spirits were glad to alter their ways. In the words of Redshift, \u201cThe vagaries of the M-bound immortals seem to strive only on a single principle: to run as they wilt, and know no change save for change itself.\u201d\nThose born under the Signs of M are both odd and silly, as are their Patterns. Their constellations every so often\u2026 ripple.\nMerid (M Sign) \u2013 Merid is special. Before the Breaking, her teeth, claws, and benevolent whimsy reached into every quarter of the Magne-Ge. Her present aspect is regularly depicted in Brush form-- a creature associated Triple-wise with the Mountain, Y, and M-- a trick of the Chrome Device that has snared Her real role in history into a faint remembrance. It was Merid that foretold the Breaking and attempted to prevent it; who tried to stymie the War of C and M; who desperately fashioned warriors to stand against the Y Blur. Of all of the Greater Spirits, it is Merid that we should most revere. For what if she forsakes us?\nCaller (M Sign) \u2013 A demimemberdress Shine who arrived from The Mural to teach his kindred how to adapt to a Magne-Ge Untime of varying reasons. Divine contests between Caller and Mnender-Foil, involving in the main the catching of fish, whether by day, season, or special festival, are many, enjoyed at our hand-camps at the end of every arm.\nLe\u03bb (M Sign) \u2013 Le\u03bb descended to the Magne-Ge at the behest of Merid during the War of C and M. He attempted to halt it, but was mightily unsuccessful. Known in other spheres as the Burping Ambassador, Le\u03bb served only a fortnight in that conflict before becoming trapped in tone. Those Wise more given to compassion say that it was Le\u03bb\u2019s continual belching that gave the Y Blur pause enough for Merid to bring in others better-suited to fight against the Monsters of Nana Null.\nPhophec (M Sign) - Before the Breaking, Phophec was a Knight of great Merid Who Held the Whole of the Blackblock Under Her Hood. He is famous for many things except for his prowess at arms, an unfortunate deficiency from which filter jokes are born. Phophec is recorded as the laziest Knight in the land, having only armed and armored once, during the Y Blur. Phophec is also known to have disappeared for a time prior, in the tumult of the War of C and M, \u201cwhich he would have none of such nonesuch.\u201d To his credit, Phophec the Scope did bend the Thermal Spirit over his knee, giving it a Mighty Spanking, which we will still enjoy a good laugh over. His daughter is Daytime-Adapted of The Pigment Truce.\nY Signs.\nThe Spirits of Y are endangered. Their whims, sketches, and may-wights have been tainted ever since the Y Blur brought on by the Chrome Device. They have been cursed, even unto their make, in a similar manner as the Dawns of Mnumbrial, a cure and redemption still beyond our means.\nThose born under the Signs of the Y once knew the harmony of the blessed Magne-Ge Mnemoli; today, however, their heart-strings are as conflicted as their Patterns. They need an unwavering architect to purify their station.\nTheir constellations are therefore wild things, running amok in the heavens as if itchy with poison ivy, and it will take a true unknown to find the salve that will finally calm them.\nMnumbrial (Y Sign) \u2013 Mnumbrial was once revered as the mightiest of the Y-spec Spirits. Then her issue, the Dawns, succumbed to the Critic Mark, a curse of Nana Null that has yet to be lifted. The Untime Folk still propitiate Mnumbrial, depicting her as a gigantic Mother Dawn holding an urn of endless M that feeds into any nearby sliver, wake, or dream. The Wise say that this M is a symbol of the loss Mnumbrial feels for failing her children\u2026 and a perhaps even as a path to curing them.\nMnender-Foil (Y Sign) \u2013 These days, Mnender-Foil the Amazing is more renowned than his truly-divine mother, Mnumbrial. In truth, the mighty Mnender-Foil is oft-regarded as only a demimemberdress of pop culture importance, an image thread in tapestries and way posts. Some say, however, Mnender-Foil will come as a herald of terrible and hopeful aspect, roaring in the return of the Dawns in proper, all of them rid forever of the Critic Mark.\nScarab-Framer (Y Sign) - Before the Breaking, Scarab-Framer was an Alchemist of great Merid Who Held the Whole of the Blackblock Under Her Hood. Since untime immemorial, it was Scarab-Framer that not only set into motion the growth of M-Nulls but also their prosperity. He is the Fore-Dawn and watcher of the Y. That their resiliency has been tampered with since the Blur is a curse that has vexed his mind into near-immobility. If Scarab-Framer could achieve the insight that escapes him still, the Y might repopulate itself, free of all evil.\nThreadwright (Y Sign) \u2013 The malicious Spirit of Fibering, Threadwright was the War-Leader of the Y Blur. He is a manifestation of the tainted magic that affects the M-Nulls and the reach-roots of Magnu, and is feared by all of the Untime Folk as a servant of the Chrome Device and Nana Null. Those creatures born under the birth sign of Threadwright take great pains to hide that fact, but with little luck: green fields, shames, and other institutes frequently become Fibered in their passage."}

Magnus was said to have been the architect of Mundus, as he created the schematics and diagrams needed to construct it.\nAs Mundus was forming, it became evident that many of the et'Ada would be required to sacrifice much of their power in order for the mortal plane to be created. Magnus realized his mistake and decided to terminate the project. The et'Ada convened at the &lt;a href=\"Adamantine%20Tower\"&gt;Adamantine Tower&lt;/a&gt; at an event known as the &lt;a href=\"Convention\"&gt;Convention&lt;/a&gt; and decided to punish Lorkhan for his trickery.\nSoon after, Magnus fled to &lt;a href=\"Aetherius\"&gt;Aetherius&lt;/a&gt; in the last of Mundus' birth-pains. In his departure, he tore a hole through Oblivion, which became &lt;a href=\"Nirn\"&gt;Nirn&lt;/a&gt;'s sun, itself now known as Magnus. Soon after many other et'Ada followed him; they became known as the &lt;a href=\"Magna%20Ge\"&gt;Magna Ge&lt;/a&gt; and left smaller holes in the sky, which became the stars. One of the many theories explaining the origins of magic is that magicka is what remains of Magnus on the world.\nLegacy.\nIn the eras that followed, many &lt;a href=\"Altmer\"&gt;Altmer&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Bretons\"&gt;Bretons&lt;/a&gt; worshipped him as a god, and he became a part of their respective &lt;a href=\"Pantheons%20of%20Tamriel\"&gt;pantheons&lt;/a&gt;. The &lt;a href=\"Ayleid\"&gt;Ayleid&lt;/a&gt;s, masters of the arcane arts, worshipped him as the god of Sight, Light, and Insight and were known to dedicate temples in his name. The &lt;a href=\"Khajiit\"&gt;Khajiit&lt;/a&gt; worship him as &lt;a href=\"Magrus\"&gt;Magrus&lt;/a&gt;.\nCyrodiilic legends say he can inhabit the bodies of powerful mages, and lend them his power. He is also associated with &lt;a href=\"Zurin%20Arctus\"&gt;Zurin Arctus&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"Underking\"&gt;Underking&lt;/a&gt;, and is sometimes represented by an astrolabe, a telescope, or, more commonly, a &lt;a href=\"Staff\"&gt;staff&lt;/a&gt;.\nArtifacts.\nHe supposedly created and used the &lt;a href=\"Staff%20of%20Magnus\"&gt;Staff of Magnus&lt;/a&gt;, one of the older artifacts of Tamriel. Legend tells that it is the only artifact capable of containing his immense power. In time, the staff will abandon the mage who wields it before they become too powerful and upset the mystical balance it is sworn to protect.\nAnother artifact attributed to him is the &lt;a href=\"Eye%20of%20Magnus\"&gt;Eye of Magnus&lt;/a&gt;, an ancient relic of immense power that was found buried under the &lt;a href=\"Nord\"&gt;Nordic&lt;/a&gt; city of &lt;a href=\"Saarthal\"&gt;Saarthal&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;a href=\"Merethic%20Era\"&gt;Merethic Era&lt;/a&gt;.\nIn &lt;a href=\"Cyrodiil\"&gt;Cyrodiil&lt;/a&gt;, there is a &lt;a href=\"Doomstones\"&gt;magical stone&lt;/a&gt; of unknown origin, located southeast of &lt;a href=\"Bravil%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;Bravil&lt;/a&gt;. It is known as the &lt;a href=\"Magnus%20Stone\"&gt;Magnus Stone&lt;/a&gt; by the populace and is said to grant a powerful blessing that bolsters the magical abilities of certain individuals."}

He was the youngest son of &lt;a href=\"Emperor\"&gt;Emperor&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Pelagius%20Septim%20II\"&gt;Pelagius Septim II&lt;/a&gt; and Empress &lt;a href=\"Quintilla\"&gt;Quintilla&lt;/a&gt;.

With one of these women he had a son named &lt;a href=\"Pelagius\"&gt;Pelagius&lt;/a&gt; as well as a daughter named &lt;a href=\"Jolethe%20Septim\"&gt;Jolethe&lt;/a&gt;.\nWar of the Red Diamond.\nAt the time of the &lt;a href=\"War%20of%20the%20Red%20Diamond\"&gt;War of the Red Diamond&lt;/a&gt; Magnus was either of King of Lilmoth or &lt;a href=\"Wayrest\"&gt;Wayrest&lt;/a&gt;. He attended &lt;a href=\"Kintyra%20Septim%20II\"&gt;Kintayra's&lt;/a&gt; coronation, and after her death continued to fight the forces of &lt;a href=\"Uriel%20Septim%20III\"&gt;Uriel III&lt;/a&gt;. In the year 3E 127, Magnus led an army of Argonians through friendly Morrowind and occupied &lt;a href=\"Kogmenthist%20Castle\"&gt;Kogmenthist Castle&lt;/a&gt;. His army would be driven back by &lt;a href=\"Potema%20Septim\"&gt;Potema Septim&lt;/a&gt;, but his brother, Cephorus would defeat Uriel's forces at the &lt;a href=\"Battle%20of%20Ichidag\"&gt;Battle of Ichidag&lt;/a&gt;. Magnus would later breach the walls of Solitude during the &lt;a href=\"Siege%20of%20Solitude\"&gt;Siege of Solitude&lt;/a&gt;, ending the war.\nAscension.\nMagnus ascended to the throne when his brother, Cephorus I, died in &lt;a href=\"3E%20140\"&gt;3E 140&lt;/a&gt;. When he ascended to &lt;a href=\"Emperor\"&gt;Emperor&lt;/a&gt;, he was already 61 years old. The many arrests and trials of those who were treacherous during the &lt;a href=\"War%20of%20the%20Red%20Diamond\"&gt;War of the Red Diamond&lt;/a&gt; drained his health. He was only two years younger than his brother.\nDeath.\nMagnus Septim died after only five years on the throne in &lt;a href=\"3E%20145\"&gt;3E 145&lt;/a&gt; at the age of 66. It is rumored that his son, &lt;a href=\"Pelagius%20Septim%20III\"&gt;Pelagius \"the Mad\"&lt;/a&gt;, killed him and ascended the throne. Scholars, however, agree that it is highly unlikely due to Pelagius's strange persona and, following the death of &lt;a href=\"Potema%20Septim\"&gt;Potema Septim&lt;/a&gt;, he was busy ruling &lt;a href=\"Solitude\"&gt;Solitude&lt;/a&gt; and thus rarely visited the &lt;a href=\"Imperial%20City\"&gt;Imperial City&lt;/a&gt;."}

The company wants us to disarm some\u2014as they referred to them\u2014ancient mechanical inconveniences. Upon seeing these \"inconveniences\" with my own eyes, I'm a bit more worried than I was before I arrived. The contrivances are giant &lt;a href=\"Akaviri\"&gt;Akaviri&lt;/a&gt; blades that swing the width of one of the main halls. Not quite sure what to do with them, I think we should explore the rest of this death trap and carefully watch for anything that might suddenly leap out and kill us.\nDay 2: So, the giant swinging blades aren't the only obstacles we have to deal with. Lucius, probably my best scout, choked on his own tongue when he ventured into one of the main rooms. Turns out, the floors in that room spew noxious gas. At this rate, I may lose a couple more of my best workers before we get this place cleaned out. I'm going to have to renegotiate our fee if I make it out of these ruins in one piece.\nDay 4: Finally got those damn gas traps shut off, and I managed to do it without losing another worker. I still ordered my workers not to spend too much time in that chamber. I'm sure more gas is seeping in somehow. Regardless, we've made more progress into the ruins.\nDay 7: We found the other end of what we think is the hall with those damn swinging blade traps. Sabrina seems to think she can make it past them if she times it right. I would rather try to block them off with a few wooden planks then send her through those swinging monstrosities. This may at least immobilize them so we can prepare for the reconstruction of the main hall.\nDay 9: Success! We managed to immobilize the swinging blades. We even managed to put some scaffolding up. Seems I may not have as hard of a time with this place as I initially feared.\nDay 10: The blade traps unexpectedly broke free of the blockade, killing one of my workers. We seem to be trapped back here now. Only one of the blockades still holds, but for how long? Sabrina said she was thinking about making a run for it.\nDay 11: Sabrina made a run for it. It didn't go as she planned, but I'm thinking about just going for it as well. The thought of Sabrina bleeding and dying from those brutal wounds is the only thing holding me back. A couple of the mercenaries we hired were able to throw us some food and a few wine skins, but we're going to have to figure out something soon or we're still going to die here. If I can work up the courage, I may run through the blades of death. Tomorrow."}

In its prime, Garlas Malatar was a city that worshipped &lt;a href=\"Meridia\"&gt;Meridia&lt;/a&gt;. It was later used as a base for &lt;a href=\"Umaril%20the%20Unfeathered\"&gt;Umaril the Unfeathered&lt;/a&gt; after his revival.\nDescription.\nGeography.\nGarlas Malatar is on the Gold Coast and as such is the westernmost Ayleid ruin in Cyrodiil. The ruins are submerged and buried, leaving only a bridge, statue of &lt;a href=\"Auri-El\"&gt;Auri-El&lt;/a&gt;, remains of walls and arches, and the underground passage into the lower ruins. The &lt;a href=\"Wyrd%20Flower%20Blossom\"&gt;Wyrd Flower Blossom&lt;/a&gt;, which typically grows in Ayleid ruins, can be found here. &lt;a href=\"Auroran\"&gt;Auroran&lt;/a&gt;s are known to inhabit the ruins due to Meridia's influence in the city. Occasionally, &lt;a href=\"Minotaur\"&gt;Minotaur&lt;/a&gt;s or &lt;a href=\"Dreugh\"&gt;Dreugh&lt;/a&gt;s are seen amidst the aboveground ruins. The ruins contain three subterranean zones: &lt;a href=\"Garlas%20Malatar%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;Garlas Malatar&lt;/a&gt;, Ceysel and Carac Abaren. The final confrontation with Umaril begins in a room in Carac Abaren. Like many Ayleid ruins, &lt;a href=\"Welkynd%20Stone\"&gt;Welkynd Stone&lt;/a&gt;s can be found scattered around the three zones.\nHistory.\n&lt;a href=\"Third%20Era\"&gt;Third Era&lt;/a&gt;.\nAround the time of the &lt;a href=\"Oblivion%20Crisis\"&gt;Oblivion Crisis&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"3E%20433\"&gt;3E 433&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Umaril%20the%20Unfeathered\"&gt;Umaril the Unfeathered&lt;/a&gt; had been resurrected, with his spirit returning to the physical plane. Once he had returned, he used the ancient ruins of Garlas Malatar as his headquarters. His Aurorans scoured the province of Cyrodiil, ransacking chapels of the Nine. In response to this, a new generation of the &lt;a href=\"Knights%20of%20the%20Nine%20%28Faction%29\"&gt;Knights of the Nine&lt;/a&gt; assembled under the orders of the &lt;a href=\"Hero%20of%20Kvatch\"&gt;Divine Crusader&lt;/a&gt;. The Divine Crusader and his Knights gathered on the outskirts of Garlas Malatar, stormed the ruins and slew the Aurorans guarding Umaril. The first wave of Aurorans were continuously resurrected by a &lt;a href=\"Dark%20Orb\"&gt;Dark Orb&lt;/a&gt; in the center of Ceysel Room until the orb was destroyed. The company advanced forward until they confronted Umaril in Carac Abaren. The Divine Crusader and Umaril dueled and the Crusader slew Umaril's physical form. With his physical body destroyed, Umaril fled to &lt;a href=\"Oblivion%20%28Realm%29\"&gt;Oblivion&lt;/a&gt; and the Divine Crusader followed him using the &lt;a href=\"Blessing%20of%20Talos\"&gt;Blessing of Talos&lt;/a&gt;. The two dueled in Oblivion above the &lt;a href=\"Imperial%20City\"&gt;Imperial City&lt;/a&gt; and Umaril's spiritual form was destroyed. From then on, Garlas Malatar was abandoned."}

He was said to have been a fair and kind ruler.\nHistory.\nGarridan Stalrous was the ruler of the settlement known as Farmantle Glens, a community consisting largely of farmers. He lived in a stone keep, alongside the rest of his people, in the northern &lt;a href=\"Jerall%20Mountains\"&gt;Jerall Mountains&lt;/a&gt;. When a great drought hit the community the twenty-seven families who lived there were starving. Garridan's own grain supply was also in low supply, only being able to sustain himself for a few months before the crisis would also affect him. Searching for a solution to the problem Garridan hired the best sages he could find, and with the gold that remained he bought as much grain from the surrounding communities to sustain his own people.\nA month had passed, and winter came closer to Garridan's lands. Garridan's patience was coming close to a breaking point, and the lord had considered selling his keep and belongings if it meant the survival of his people. Then a sage appeared at Garridan's keep with a possible solution. The sage informed the ruler of an artifact known as the \"&lt;a href=\"Everflow%20Ewer\"&gt;Everflow Ewer&lt;/a&gt;\". This ewer would pour water endlessly, and was said by some to have been created by the divines, while others claimed it was a sorcerer who created it. Regardless of its origins, Garridan knew this artifact would save his people from starvation. He, alongside his squire and the sage, made their way to the location of the ewer, &lt;a href=\"Frostfire%20Cave\"&gt;Frostfire Cave&lt;/a&gt;.\nAfter days of travel, the three had come to the cave known as Garridan used &lt;a href=\"Refined%20Frost%20Salts\"&gt;Refined Frost Salts&lt;/a&gt; to go through a special door, coming to the Frostfire Glade. The sage had spoken truly, in the middle of an enclove, surrounded by rocks, the ewer stood, with water filled to the top. Garridan, who was eager to return with the ewer and end the hunger at Farmantle Glens, took the ewer. After Garridan had taken the ewer, the ground began to shake, the trees appeared to be bending away from the altar, and the sky, which was blue at first, turned gray. Then, suddenly, one of the standing stones near the altar exploded, and a &lt;a href=\"Frost%20Atronach\"&gt;Frost Atronach&lt;/a&gt; appeared. Garridan, being a knight, told his squire to run while he himself drew his sword. Still holding the ewer, Garridan tried to damage the creature, but only barely damaged it. Garridan kept swinging at the creature, hoping to damage it, but his attacks were futile. Then, in one hit, the atronach punched the lord, resulting in Garridan falling down and dropping his blade. Being unarmed, Garridan looked at the atronach, which was raising its arm to kill the lord. In a reflex, Garridan kneeled and held the ewer in his hands in a defensive position, resulting in the atronach hitting the ewer.\nWith the ewer destroyed, water began to flow everywhere, and froze instantly due to the cold, resulting in Garridan being entombed with his enemy in the ice. Garridan, being locked in place, started to cry. He knew he had failed to protect his people, and that they would starve. His tears were frozen as they fell, and would later be searched for by several people, including &lt;a href=\"S%27drassa\"&gt;S'drassa&lt;/a&gt;.\nMoments after Garridan had been frozen, his squire noticed that the air near the altar had become very cold, and he decided to make his way back to the lands of his lord. When he arrived at Farmantle Glens, the families were waiting for him. While he was ready to announce the news of the death of his lord, the farmers were overjoyed, as a week before his arrival, a blueish rain began to fell, resulting in their crops growing like there had never been a drought. The squire knew that a week ago Garridan was frozen in ice, and his tears also had a blueish tint to them. As such, he linked the events together, and thanked Mara.\n&lt;a href=\"Tears%20of%20the%20Savior\"&gt;Tears of the Savior&lt;/a&gt;.\nDuring the final days of the &lt;a href=\"Third%20Era\"&gt;Third Era&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"S%27drassa\"&gt;S'drassa&lt;/a&gt; of the &lt;a href=\"Leyawiin%20Mages%20Guild\"&gt;Leyawiin Mages Guild&lt;/a&gt; was searching for precious gems, and had come across Garridan's Tears. He tasks the &lt;a href=\"Hero%20of%20Kvatch\"&gt;Hero of Kvatch&lt;/a&gt; with finding 6 tears in return for a reward of ."}
