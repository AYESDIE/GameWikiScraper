However, Khamira refuses to do anything with the Horn until they have discovered the full extent of its capabilities. To that end, she has &lt;a href=\"Abnur%20Tharn%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Abnur Tharn&lt;/a&gt; do research. Meanwhile, Khamira wants the Vestige to track down &lt;a href=\"Zumog%20Phoom%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Zumog Phoom&lt;/a&gt; and prevent the resurrection of &lt;a href=\"Cadwell%20the%20Betrayer%20%28Character%29\"&gt;Cadwell the Betrayer&lt;/a&gt;.\nTo find out where Zumog Phoom may be, the Vestige is told to check on Abnur Tharn, who is watching over &lt;a href=\"Cadwell\"&gt;Cadwell&lt;/a&gt;. The pair can be found on the first floor down a corridor. Cadwell is in the middle of another vision while Abnur watches. Abnur will soon cast a spell to make it possible for the Vestige to speak to Cadwell. \nCadwell can't pinpoint where Zumog Phoom is, though he confirms Khamira's suspicions that Zumog Phoom has all of the Betrayer's body parts. Despite the Vestige's protests, Cadwell opens a portal and goes to where Zumog Phoom is, driven by his visions. Abnur believes Cadwell's soul is the last piece Zumog Phoom needs to restore the Betrayer. Since Abnur managed to scry Cadwell's portal before it shut, he has pinpointed Cadwell's location to an ancient crypt in the Scar. \nAbnur instructs the Vestige to head to the ancient crypt as quickly as possible. He and the others will make preparations and join them soon. Once the Vestige arrives outside the crypt, they will find Abnur Tharn waiting for them. However, the Vestige notices the absence of &lt;a href=\"Zamarak\"&gt;Zamarak&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Prefect%20Calo\"&gt;Prefect Calo&lt;/a&gt;. Abnur explains they volunteered to scout ahead but have failed to return, leaving the task of stopping Zumog Phoom to him and the Vestige. \nInside the Sepulcher of Mischance, the Vestige and Abnur will come across Cadwell spying down on Zumog Phoom. Cadwell admits to trying to kill Zumog but failed, enabling Zumog to steal his essence and use it to restore the Betrayer. Cadwell says he doesn't know what Zumog Phoom has done to Zamarak and Prefect Calo, Cadwell is struggling to regain strength, as it is. The Vestige promises to recover Cadwell's essence, who in turn offers to join them in their search.\nIn the lower crypts, the Vestige must locate various ritual sites where the essence or energy of Cadwell is stored. The first one contains Prefect Calo, trapped inside an orb of energy and guarded by &lt;a href=\"Necromancer%20Otho\"&gt;Necromancer Otho&lt;/a&gt;, who is hostile. Killing the necromancer will free Prefect Calo and allow the Vestige to retrieve a fragment of Cadwell's stolen energy. \nIn the crypt library, Zamarak is trapped much like Prefect Calo was, this time guarded by &lt;a href=\"Skullguard%20Marama\"&gt;Skullguard Marama&lt;/a&gt;, who must be defeated. Once Zamarak is free and Cadwell's energy is retrieved, the Vestige must proceed to the Funerary Chamber. Inside, the Vestige will encounter Skullguard Grundu, guarding an orb with Abnur Tharn trapped inside. Proceed to the Necromancer Workshop after freeing Abnur and acquiring the energy.\nInside the Necromancer Workshop, the Vestige encounters the spirit of &lt;a href=\"Captain%20Nala-do\"&gt;Captain Nala-do&lt;/a&gt;. The Captain knows they shouldn't here, but got summoned by Zumog Phoom to take part in his ritual. Being a soldier, the Captain resisted and killed Zumog's follower. However, the Vestige learns the Captain had accidentally absorbed the portion of Cadwell's energy intended for the ritual. The Captain is content to part with and lose their form in the process. \nThe Vestige must now proceed to Zumog Phoom's Lair and disrupt the ritual. Zumog Phoom will immediately engaged in combat once the Vestige approaches him. Once he is slain, Cadwell the Betrayer will emerge and applaud the Vestige. He claims the ritual is complete and he will proceed to fulfill his destiny. The Betrayer disappears through a portal. \nCadwell is sitting on the ground. He asks the Vestige to try hold the Betrayer's actions against him as they are simply, \"two sides of a dented coin.\" Cadwell notes the world can't handle the existence of two Cadwells, causing the remainder of Cadwell's essence to slowly drain away. He beseeches the Vestige to stop the Betrayer, gives some advice on what the Betrayer plans to do and directs them to Khamira. \nA portal opens up to allow the Vestige to return to &lt;a href=\"Rimmen%20Palace\"&gt;Rimmen Palace&lt;/a&gt;. Shortly after, Cadwell disintegrates. At the Palace, the Vestige reveals to Khamira the return of the Betrayer and says the Betrayer seeks a &lt;a href=\"Plane%20of%20Jode\"&gt;special place&lt;/a&gt; to find &lt;a href=\"Jode%27s%20Core%20%28Item%29\"&gt;Jode's Core&lt;/a&gt;, as well as the existence of a key Khamira might have. Khamira orders everyone, including the Vestige, into the Royal Study, and reveals to them her belief a pendant she inherited from her mother is likely the key in question. \nKhamira manages to activate the pendant, which reveals a specific location on the ancient map in front of her. Khamira reveals said location is an ancient ruin, formerly the &lt;a href=\"Shadow%20Dance%20Temple\"&gt;Shadow Dance Temple&lt;/a&gt;. After describing the tales of &lt;a href=\"Khunzar-ri\"&gt;Khunzar-ri&lt;/a&gt;, Khamira and the Vestige figure out that the Betrayer is heading to the ancient ruin to acquire the power of the &lt;a href=\"Dragons%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Dragons&lt;/a&gt; stored there. \nThe Vestige must travel to the ruins and meet Khamira there. Khamira is found trying to figure out a way to make the Moons move, as her ancestor, &lt;a href=\"Anequina%20Sharp-Tongue\"&gt;Anequina Sharp-Tongue&lt;/a&gt;, had done, but all her attempts using the pendant have failed. The Vestige encourages her to try out a phrase her mother used to say to the pendant. Once Khamira does so, a portal leading to the Shadow Dance Temple opens up at the center of the room. The Vestige and Khamira proceed to enter it. \nAcross the bridge and inside the Shadow Dance Temple, the Vestige discovers a relic. Upon examining it, the spectral of several priests appear and move to stand in a half circle, just outside the doorway leading to the next relic. Several hostile &lt;a href=\"Moon-Sentinel\"&gt;Moon-Sentinel&lt;/a&gt;s must be defeated along the way. Eventually, the Vestige comes across of a memory featuring the Betrayer threatening, and soon killing, a priest while standing among a pile of dead priests. \nFurther along, the Vestige will locate the second Temple relic and activate it, summoning another group of spectral priests. Khamira will also figure out how to move the Moons and reach Jode's Core: by causing an eclipse. The Vestige must proceed forth to find the third and final relic. There is a brief vision of the Betrayer walking past the corpses of priests who had \"thrown themselves at him\" to defend the temple. The Betrayer mocks their actions.\nBeyond the vision are more hostile Moon-Sentinels and eventually the third relic, which must be activated. The Vestige will then head toward the Temple Sanctuary, though Khamira will intercept them just before entering, since she wants to talk before they confront the Betrayer. \nKhamira reveals she is becoming attuned to the ancient memories and points out Khunzar-ri, Anequina, and the Betrayer had all walked the same path as they have to reach Jode's Core. She describes the truth behind the myths of Khunzar-ri, such that the path to the Core only appears at the Moon Gate of Anequina during an eclipse. \nThere is an apparatus in the sanctuary, linked to the larger Moon Gate, Khamira wishes to focus on. The Vestige offers to leave the apparatus to Khamira while they deal with the Betrayer. The Vestige proceeds through the Vault of the Heavenly Scourge. As it had occurred in history, the Vestige must ensure the events repeat and Cadwell the Betrayer fails to achieve his goal. \nOnce the Betrayer has been slain, Khamira reveals the Betrayer had done something to the apparatus as the Moons cannot \"hear her plea,\" meaning she cannot stop the eclipse the Betrayer had started. This also means there is nothing to stop the Dragons from using the Moon Gate of Anequina to reach Jode's Core. \nFortunately, all is not lost. Khamira has already sent forces to defend the Moon Gate of Anequina from the Dragons. Khamira also reveals that, according to the memories of Anequina, the Dragonhorn the Vestige had acquired earlier needs to be energized, have its power restored, by using a nearby Temple Relic. After doing so, Khamira will open up a portal through the apparatus. \nAlmost immediately after the portal opens, another smaller portal opens and out jumps Cadwell, who has recovered thanks to the destruction of his other half. Upon learning what his other half had done, Cadwell reveals that if he concentrates, he can see what went through his other half's mind. He does suggest a way to undo what the Betrayer did, but notes Khamira is looking a little \"peaked.\"\nThe Vestige must return to Rimmen Palace instead of proceeding further with any attempt to stop the Dragons. Cadwell's portal will lead the Vestige straight to it. At the palace, Khamira says she has sent &lt;a href=\"Gharesh-ri\"&gt;Gharesh-ri&lt;/a&gt; to lead the forces at the Moon Gate of Anequina, and that she intends to join him shortly. Khamira then rewards the Vestige for their help. "}

Before the revelation of the &lt;a href=\"Nerevarine%20Prophecy\"&gt;Nerevarine Prophecy&lt;/a&gt;, Caius Cosades was in contact with the &lt;a href=\"Nerevarine\"&gt;Nerevarine&lt;/a&gt;, when they arrived into Vvardenfell.\nBackground.\n&lt;a href=\"Third%20Era\"&gt;Third Era&lt;/a&gt;.\nDuring the events of &lt;a href=\"3E%20427\"&gt;3E 427&lt;/a&gt;, Caius Cosades was the head of the Blades in Vvardenfell, being situated in the city-state of &lt;a href=\"Balmora\"&gt;Balmora&lt;/a&gt;. Cosades received information from &lt;a href=\"Uriel%20Septim%20VII\"&gt;Uriel Septim VII&lt;/a&gt; himself about a prisoner that piqued the Emperor's interest, he wants this prisoner to fulfill the &lt;a href=\"Nerevarine%20Prophecy\"&gt;Nerevarine Prophecy&lt;/a&gt; for his own deeds. After the &lt;a href=\"Nerevarine\"&gt;prisoner&lt;/a&gt; was brought to &lt;a href=\"Seyda%20Neen\"&gt;Seyda Neen&lt;/a&gt;, they were redirected to Balmora, where they would meet with Caius Cosades at his home. At that point, Cosades had named the prisoner, a novice of the Blades.\nFrom that point on, Cosades had used the prisoner as an agent, sending them on quests and have them meet with correspondents such as &lt;a href=\"Hasphat%20Antabolis\"&gt;Hasphat Antabolis&lt;/a&gt; of the &lt;a href=\"Fighters%20Guild\"&gt;Fighters Guild&lt;/a&gt;, a handful of informants in Vivec, and &lt;a href=\"Sul-Matuul\"&gt;Sul-Matuul&lt;/a&gt; of the &lt;a href=\"Urshilaku%20Tribe\"&gt;Urshilaku Tribe&lt;/a&gt;, and a handful of others. As time went on, the plan was going smoothly and it seemed that this Agent was the Nerevarine of legend. After he had sent the Agent to the cavern of &lt;a href=\"Ilunibi\"&gt;Ilunibi&lt;/a&gt; and the Agent slew &lt;a href=\"Dagoth%20Gares\"&gt;Dagoth Gares&lt;/a&gt;, the Agent had contracted &lt;a href=\"Corprus\"&gt;Corprus&lt;/a&gt;. He would then send them to &lt;a href=\"Divayth%20Fyr\"&gt;Divayth Fyr&lt;/a&gt;, who would cure them. When the Agent returned, he was promoted to Operative but told this was their last order from Cosades, who was recalled to the &lt;a href=\"Imperial%20City\"&gt;Imperial City&lt;/a&gt;. Caius presumed it had to do with the Emperor's health and his succession, and so assumed he would be gone for a while. Caius left &lt;a href=\"Caius%20Cosades%27%20House\"&gt;his house&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Caius%27%20Ring\"&gt;his ring&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Caius%27%20Black%20Pants\"&gt;his Blades pants&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Caius%27%20Black%20Shirt\"&gt;his Blades shirt&lt;/a&gt; for the Agent until his return. Caius Cosades traveled back to Cyrodiil, informing the Agent that he feared for the future of the Empire. The Operative continued their journey, fulfilling the Nerevarine Prophecy.\n&lt;a href=\"Fourth%20Era\"&gt;Fourth Era&lt;/a&gt;.\nAfter the &lt;a href=\"Oblivion%20Crisis\"&gt;Oblivion Crisis&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"3E%20433\"&gt;3E 433&lt;/a&gt;, Caius Cosades was stationed in the city-state of &lt;a href=\"Kragenmoor\"&gt;Kragenmoor&lt;/a&gt;, which was under the occupation of &lt;a href=\"House%20Hlaalu\"&gt;House Hlaalu&lt;/a&gt;. Fortunately for him, the Crisis did not entirely affect Kragenmoor and the local shrine of &lt;a href=\"Akatosh\"&gt;Akatosh&lt;/a&gt; had pilgrims coming in the ten-folds. He would eventually move back to Cyrodiil and the city-state of &lt;a href=\"Kvatch\"&gt;Kvatch&lt;/a&gt; to see his sister and the local festival. Once he had returned, he visited the tomb of Uriel Septim VII, paying his respects to his old friend. Praising how &lt;a href=\"Martin%20Septim\"&gt;Martin Septim&lt;/a&gt; turned out, as opposed to his other sons with &lt;a href=\"Caula%20Voria\"&gt;Caula Voria&lt;/a&gt;. Caius would eventually leave and continue his duties as a Spymaster of the Blades.\nLegacy.\nOnce Caius Cosades had left for Cyrodiil in 3E 427, his operative continued with the plans and established themselves as the Nerevarine. From then on, the Nerevarine would fulfill the prophecy, slaying both &lt;a href=\"Dagoth%20Ur%20%28Character%29\"&gt;Dagoth Ur&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Almalexia\"&gt;Almalexia&lt;/a&gt;. His efforts with the Nerevarine in Vvardenfell caused a long-term effect on Morrowind, which inadvertently was the &lt;a href=\"Red%20Year\"&gt;Red Year&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"Accession%20War\"&gt;Accession War&lt;/a&gt;, and the revoked &lt;a href=\"Great%20House\"&gt;Great House&lt;/a&gt; status of House Hlaalu. What became of Caius Cosades is unknown, but he likely passed away of old age, considering his appearance. His age in 3E 427 is unknown but by then, he was a senior member of the Blades. The faction itself would eventually become fragmented and resurface in &lt;a href=\"Skyrim\"&gt;Skyrim&lt;/a&gt;."}

I can't say I'm sorry to lose your three sons. None of them worth a fig, as I've told you many times... not to your face, of course... but nonetheless, I know it must have hurt bitter-hard, harder than the Dawnman's daggers, I expect.\n\"But in the end, you'd got &lt;a href=\"Martin%20Septim\"&gt;Martin&lt;/a&gt; well-hidden away... you sly dog, I never guessed... and he turned out to be worth twice the lot of those preening fools you got on the scheming witch, &lt;a href=\"Caula%20Voria\"&gt;Caula Voria&lt;/a&gt;, may she die again tomorrow.

He made as if to tuck the knife back into his pouch, then, thinking again, he took the knife and buried it up to the handle in the dirt, right in the center of the ring of apple slices.\n\"There you are, your Majesty. My &lt;a href=\"Blades\"&gt;Blade&lt;/a&gt;, ever and always at your service. It was a pleasure to know you, and be your rough tool, in this and every other thing. I hope they find a nice spot for you up there with Lord Tiber and the rest of your sainted kin.\"\nThe Imperial unfolded his legs and rose in a smooth motion, dusting the dirt from his backside. \"And I hope they hurry up and put a proper stone on the spot, too. Like all &lt;a href=\"Elder%20Council\"&gt;Council&lt;/a&gt; work, I imagine it's still a piece of patronage buried under some pile of papers in a clerk's ratnest. Fair enough.

It was even said that Calaxes advocated full-scale rebellion to establish a theocracy over the Empire. Calaxes' relation with his father began to become very precarious.\nOne day, Calaxes mysteriously disappeared without leaving any trace. Some believe he was removed by the &lt;a href=\"Imperial%20Guard\"&gt;Imperial Guard&lt;/a&gt; as they saw him as a threat to the Emperor. It is suggested that the Lady &lt;a href=\"Allena%20Benoch\"&gt;Allena Benoch&lt;/a&gt; had something to do with his disappearance. By &lt;a href=\"3E%20433\"&gt;3E 433&lt;/a&gt;, Uriel believed all his sons beside Martin were dead, implying Calaxes was indeed deceased. Whatever the case, his death was confirmed following the Oblivion Crisis, when the Septim Bloodline ended."}

Sometimes there is a glitch and the spider is not there, and the staff is impossible to pickup.\nThrone Chamber.\nThe Throne Chamber consists of a main room with a raised throne and guard. &lt;a href=\"Dwemer%20Artifacts\"&gt;Dwarven junk&lt;/a&gt; is scattered around, along with several &lt;a href=\"Traps%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;traps&lt;/a&gt;.

There are two side chambers here; take advantage of the guard's patrol to slip through the door when he steps away from it. A large workroom pans out from here.

This can be dangerous as there is a Dwarven Ballista Trap, Dwarven Thresher Trap and Flamethrower Trap.\nMarkarth Wizard's Balcony.\nThe great balcony atop the keep connects Calcelmo's laboratory to his tower, a separate structure off the main body of the Keep. There's a great view of the city from here. One section of the balcony wall has broken away, exposing a path around the cliffside that ends in a waterfall.\nCalcelmo's Tower.\nThe tower has a lower-level entry hall, an upper-level office, and a massive stone relic containing a text in Dwemer and Falmer on the same granite slab. This stone is the key to Calcelmo's current research, a secret he jealously protects."}

During the full moon, the Calcinator should face due South, aligned with the Southron pole star. It is well known that the Southron pole star is slightly offset from true south. The diligent &lt;a href=\"Alchemy%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;Alchemist&lt;/a&gt; will refer to star charts for the specific day and time to more precisely align the Calcinator.\nFor each night of the phases of the moon after full, the Calcinator should be rotated clockwise one twenty-eighth of a circle. If the alchemist is closer to the Southron pole star than the Northern Sisters, he should rotate it counter-clockwise instead. Set the device where the moonlight is shining on half of it. Of course, if it is a new moon, the Calcinator should be fully exposed instead.\nProper alignment of the Calcinator will create one part in forty-seven more purity of the distillate.

The precise nature of the Hero's &lt;a href=\"Crime%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;crime&lt;/a&gt;, if any, that led to their arrest is unspecified. The Hero was placed in a cell that is supposed to be off-limits due to a mix up in their placement (something that is said to happen often). Considering this and &lt;a href=\"Uriel%20Septim%20VII\"&gt;Uriel Septim&lt;/a&gt;'s statement that the prisoner had been in his dreams, it is suggested that divine intervention played a role in the Hero's destiny.\nThe Hero of Kvatch briefly joins &lt;a href=\"Emperor\"&gt;Emperor&lt;/a&gt; Uriel Septim VII's retinue along with the &lt;a href=\"Blades%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;Blades&lt;/a&gt; members &lt;a href=\"Renault\"&gt;Renault&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Glenroy\"&gt;Glenroy&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Baurus\"&gt;Baurus&lt;/a&gt; as they attempted to escort the Emperor to safety from &lt;a href=\"Mythic%20Dawn\"&gt;Mythic Dawn&lt;/a&gt; assassins. The prisoner is freed when the Emperor's retinue passes through their cell on their way to a secret passage, and the Emperor mysteriously identifies the Hero as a person of importance. The Hero escorts Uriel Septim and the Blades for a while. Eventually, Mythic Dawn assassins appear to ambush the group, but they are fended off.\nFinding the Heir.\nEventually, the Hero and the Emperor are cornered in a small room whilst his bodyguards engage several Mythic Dawn agents. In the midst of the fight, the Emperor hands the Hero an amulet \u2014 the &lt;a href=\"Amulet%20of%20Kings%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;Amulet of Kings&lt;/a&gt; \u2014 and tells the hero to bring it to &lt;a href=\"Jauffre%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;Jauffre&lt;/a&gt;. Soon after, he is killed by a Mythic Dawn assassin who comes out of a secret passage. The assassin is quickly dispatched, but the damage has already been done. Baurus mentions that Jauffre was located at &lt;a href=\"Weynon%20Priory%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;Weynon Priory&lt;/a&gt; and reluctantly entrusts the Amulet to the Hero. The Hero then leaves the prison through the sewers and proceeds to Weynon Priory.\nArriving at Weynon Priory.\nAfter meeting with Jauffre, now a monk at the priory, and showing him the Amulet of Kings, he demands to know how such an important artifact came to be in the Hero's possession. The hero then informs Jauffre of the deaths of the Emperor and his three heirs. Jauffre explains that in order to keep the Daedra of Oblivion from invading &lt;a href=\"Tamriel\"&gt;Tamriel&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Akatosh\"&gt;Akatosh&lt;/a&gt; gave &lt;a href=\"St.%20Alessia\"&gt;St. Alessia&lt;/a&gt; the Amulet of Kings and the eternal Dragonfires of the Imperial City. They then made a covenant to keep the gates of Oblivion shut, so long as those of the dragon blood wore the amulet.\nDespite the direness of the situation, Jauffre tells the Hero that not all is lost, for one last heir still lives: &lt;a href=\"Martin%20Septim%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;Martin Septim&lt;/a&gt;, the Emperor's illegitimate son, who as a baby was entrusted to him. The Hero then heads to the &lt;a href=\"Chapel%20of%20Akatosh\"&gt;Chapel of Akatosh&lt;/a&gt; in the city of &lt;a href=\"Kvatch%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;Kvatch&lt;/a&gt;, where Martin is now living as a priest. The Hero is then to bring him back to the priory so that he can be escorted to &lt;a href=\"Cloud%20Ruler%20Temple%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;Cloud Ruler Temple&lt;/a&gt;, the headquarters of the Blades located in the &lt;a href=\"Jerall%20Mountains\"&gt;Jerall Mountains&lt;/a&gt;, where Martin can be kept safe by the knights sworn to his bloodline.\nBattle of Kvatch.\nUpon reaching Kvatch, the Hero finds that &lt;a href=\"Daedra\"&gt;Daedra&lt;/a&gt; have invaded it in search of Martin. At the city gates, the few remaining guards and their captain are attempting to hold off the Daedra coming out of the nearby &lt;a href=\"Oblivion%20Gate%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;Oblivion Gate&lt;/a&gt;. The Hero enters the gate and removes its &lt;a href=\"Sigil%20Stone%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;Sigil Stone&lt;/a&gt;, closing it. Another small skirmish ensues inside the city, after which the hero finds Martin in the Chapel of Akatosh. He follows the Hero, now that the Oblivion Gate is closed and the townsfolk safe. The Hero aids the remaining guards in purging the city of Daedra, and then returns to Weynon Priory, only to be confronted by Mythic Dawn Assassins. Martin and The Hero fight their way to Jauffre, who survived the attack but had failed to prevent them from taking the Amulet of Kings.\nBaurus and the Path of Dawn.\nAfter speaking to Martin and Jauffre, the Hero learns that they should talk to Baurus to see if he learned anything about the assassins. Once in the &lt;a href=\"Imperial%20City%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;Imperial City&lt;/a&gt;, they find Baurus in &lt;a href=\"Luther%20Broad%27s%20Boarding%20House\"&gt;Luther Broad's Boarding House&lt;/a&gt;. Baurus tells them that the man sitting behind him was watching him, and tells the Hero to back him up and proceeds to the basement. In the basement, the man attacks, revealing himself to be a member of the Mythic Dawn cult. Baurus tells the Hero about the cult. The Hero retrieves the first volume of a book called the \"\"&lt;a href=\"Mythic%20Dawn%20Commentaries\"&gt;Mythic Dawn Commentaries&lt;/a&gt;\"\" off the corpse of the dead cultist. Baurus suggests that the Hero go see &lt;a href=\"Tar-Meena\"&gt;Tar-Meena&lt;/a&gt; at the &lt;a href=\"Arcane%20University%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;Arcane University&lt;/a&gt; to see what she knows about the book.\nInvestigating the Mythic Dawn.\nAt the University, Tar-Meena reveals that the Commentaries are a collection of four books written by &lt;a href=\"Mankar%20Camoran%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;Mankar Camoran&lt;/a&gt;, the leader of the Mythic Dawn and that there is a hidden message for those interested in joining. She returns the first volume to the Hero and gives them the second volume as well. She suggests that the Hero look for the last two volumes at &lt;a href=\"First%20Edition%20%28Location%29\"&gt;First Edition&lt;/a&gt;.\nAfter arriving there, the shopkeeper says that he has a copy of &lt;a href=\"Mythic%20Dawn%20Commentaries%203\"&gt;third volume&lt;/a&gt;, but it has been reserved for a man named &lt;a href=\"Gwinas\"&gt;Gwinas&lt;/a&gt;. When Gwinas arrives, the Hero tells him about its connection to the Mythic Dawn cult and the Emperor's assassination. Gwinas, flustered by this news and eager to remove any connection between himself and the assassins, gladly hands it over, as well as a note arranging a meeting with a member of the Mythic Dawn, which Gwinas says is the only way to get the &lt;a href=\"Mythic%20Dawn%20Commentaries%204\"&gt;fourth volume&lt;/a&gt;.\nImpersonating an Initiate.\nAfter hearing this news, Baurus and the Hero make their way through the sewers to the meeting place but have to fight and kill the cultists. After retrieving the last volume of the Commentaries, the Hero brings all four books to Tar-Meena, who deciphers the hidden message after a few days. She tells the Hero the hidden message: \"Green Emperor Way Where Tower Reaches Midday Sun.\"\nMysterium Xarxes.\nThe Hero travels to &lt;a href=\"Green%20Emperor%20Way\"&gt;Green Emperor Way&lt;/a&gt; and locates a map on the tomb of Prince Camarril showing the location of the Mythic Dawn base. The Hero follows the map to &lt;a href=\"Lake%20Arrius%20Caverns\"&gt;Lake Arrius Caverns&lt;/a&gt; and infiltrates the Mythic Dawn's base there. After seeing Mankar Camoran travel through a portal to his \"&lt;a href=\"Paradise%20%28Location%29\"&gt;Paradise&lt;/a&gt;,\" the Hero steals the &lt;a href=\"Mysterium%20Xarxes\"&gt;Mysterium Xarxes&lt;/a&gt; and brings it to Martin at Cloud Ruler Temple.\nMartin expresses shock that the Hero would bring him the Mysterium Xarxes, explaining that it is dangerous even to handle. However, Martin calms down and decides that bringing it to him was the best thing to do, regardless of the danger. He asks the Hero to give him the Mysterium Xarxes because he knows of ways to protect himself from its evil power, and he is capable of deciphering it.\nObtaining the Blood of a Daedra.\nAfter deciphering part of the Mysterium Xarxes, Martin discovers that Mankar Camoran bound himself to the book, and used a ritual to create his Paradise. Martin was only able to decipher what the first item was, \"the Blood of a Daedra.\" Martin speaks of Daedric shrines and how Daedric artifacts are created from the essence of a Daedra Prince. The Hero must obtain any &lt;a href=\"Daedric%20artifact\"&gt;Daedric artifact&lt;/a&gt; and bring it to Martin.\nObtaining the Blood of a Divine.\nNext, Martin asks for the second ritual piece, \"the Blood of a &lt;a href=\"Divine\"&gt;Divine&lt;/a&gt;,\" which is a puzzle as \"the Divines do not manifest themselves in the mortal world.\" He deduces that the blood of Tiber Septim (who ascended to become the Divine &lt;a href=\"Talos\"&gt;Talos&lt;/a&gt;), which was on his &lt;a href=\"Armor%20of%20Tiber%20Septim\"&gt;armor&lt;/a&gt;, would fill the requirement. The Hero travels to &lt;a href=\"Sancre%20Tor%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;Sancre Tor&lt;/a&gt; to find that the way to the armor is blocked by an evil force. After the spirits of four ancient Blades are freed, the spirits gather and completed their original mission - to purge Sancre Tor of the evil force plaguing it. With the evil banished, the Hero retrieves the armor and brings it back to Martin.\nObtaining the Great Welkynd Stone.\nMartin then requests the third item, a &lt;a href=\"Great%20Welkynd%20Stone\"&gt;Great Welkynd Stone&lt;/a&gt;. The Hero heads to &lt;a href=\"Miscarcand%20%28Location%29\"&gt;Miscarcand&lt;/a&gt; to find it. After fighting the King of Miscarcand and some &lt;a href=\"Zombie%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;zombies&lt;/a&gt;, the hero obtains the Great Welkynd Stone and takes it to Martin.\nThe Great Sigil Stone and Second Battle of Bruma.\nA &lt;a href=\"Great%20Sigil%20Stone%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;Great Sigil Stone&lt;/a&gt; is the final requirement in order for Martin to open a portal into Paradise. However, the only way to obtain one is from a &lt;a href=\"Great%20Gate\"&gt;Great Gate&lt;/a&gt;, similar to the one at Kvatch. Thus the Mythic Dawn must be allowed to proceed with a plan to attack Bruma. Martin suits up in armor, states that he will lead the battle (with the army the Hero may have assembled from the quest \"&lt;a href=\"Allies%20for%20Bruma\"&gt;Allies for Bruma&lt;/a&gt;\"), despite the protests from Jauffre and the Hero.\nThe Hero then makes their way to Bruma and speaks with Countess &lt;a href=\"Narina%20Carvain\"&gt;Narina Carvain&lt;/a&gt; and Captain &lt;a href=\"Burd\"&gt;Burd&lt;/a&gt; to explain the plan. While they are doubtful, they both agree and all meet at the Chapel of Talos to discuss the upcoming battle.\nWhen everything is prepared, the soldiers of Cyrodiil make their way to the battlefield, led by Martin, the Hero, Jauffre, Baurus and Captain Burd. After Martin gives a motivating speech, an Oblivion Gate opens and the Daedra begin to pour out. The Hero and the soldiers begin to fight against the hordes of Daedra as two other Oblivion Gates open. Eventually, the Great Gate opens and the Hero enters Oblivion once again.\nInside, the Great Siege Crawler which destroyed Kvatch is sighted. Time is limited, so the Hero quickly travels through Oblivion, slaying Daedra along the way. The Hero then reaches the Great Sigil Stone and removes it.\nThe Hero arrives back on the battlefield, seeing part of the Great Siege Machine out on their world, but broken and destroyed. The Oblivion Gates have closed and the soldiers of Cyrodiil slay the remaining Daedra.\nIn the end, the battle is won and &lt;a href=\"Mehrunes%20Dagon\"&gt;Mehrunes Dagon&lt;/a&gt; is dealt a blow. The soldiers cheer their victory and cheer for their new emperor, who has proven himself well on the battlefield. Martin then urges the Hero to meet him at Cloud Ruler Temple where they can finally conduct the ritual and enter Paradise.\nInvading Camoran's Paradise.\nMartin, in possession of the four items needed to open a portal to Camoran's &lt;a href=\"Paradise%20%28Location%29\"&gt;Paradise&lt;/a&gt;, tells the Hero that the portal is a one-way trip and that if he is right, the Hero can only escape by killing Camoran. The Hero accepts this and proceeds to Paradise. After making their way through the &lt;a href=\"Savage%20Garden\"&gt;Savage Garden&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Forbidden%20Grotto\"&gt;Forbidden Grotto&lt;/a&gt;, the hero finds and kills Camoran and his family and, just as Martin guessed, Paradise is destroyed and the hero returned to &lt;a href=\"Mundus\"&gt;Mundus&lt;/a&gt;.\nRelighting the Dragonfires.\nMartin, the Hero, and their allies move to the Imperial City to crown Martin and end the crisis. The Daedra launch a last-ditch assault on the city, led by &lt;a href=\"Mehrunes%20Dagon\"&gt;Mehrunes Dagon&lt;/a&gt; himself. The Hero and Martin make their way to the &lt;a href=\"Temple%20of%20the%20One\"&gt;Temple of the One&lt;/a&gt;, where Martin breaks the Amulet of Kings and absorbs its power to become the Avatar of &lt;a href=\"Akatosh\"&gt;Akatosh&lt;/a&gt; in order to combat Mehrunes Dagon. Martin, as the Avatar of Akatosh, succeeds in defeating the Prince of Destruction, but spends all of his energy in doing so. The Avatar/Martin's body then turns to stone, forever protecting &lt;a href=\"Nirn\"&gt;Nirn&lt;/a&gt; from the Daedra of Oblivion.\nAfter the Oblivion Crisis.\nSoon after Dagon's defeat, &lt;a href=\"High%20Chancellor\"&gt;High Chancellor&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Ocato\"&gt;Ocato&lt;/a&gt; arrives at the scene of the climactic battle. He and the Hero talk about how Martin's sacrifice permanently protected all of &lt;a href=\"Tamriel\"&gt;Tamriel&lt;/a&gt; and Nirn from &lt;a href=\"Oblivion%20%28Realm%29\"&gt;Oblivion&lt;/a&gt;. Ocato says that Martin died as a hero who would rival Tiber Septim himself and that he would have made a great Emperor. With the Septim bloodline lost, however, the &lt;a href=\"Elder%20Council\"&gt;Elder Council&lt;/a&gt; will have to keep the Empire running until a new Emperor is crowned.\nOcato, recognizing the Hero's contributions to the Empire, proclaims the hero the &lt;a href=\"Champion%20of%20Cyrodiil\"&gt;Champion of Cyrodiil&lt;/a&gt; and has a set of &lt;a href=\"Imperial%20Dragon%20Armor%20%28Armor%29\"&gt;Imperial Dragon Armor&lt;/a&gt; crafted as a reward.\nFate.\nThe cutscene following the combat between Dagon and Akatosh, the voice of Martin is heard talking to the Hero about Tamriel's future, as well as the Champion's; \"When the next Elder Scroll is written, you shall be its scribe. The shape of the future, the fate of the Empire - these things, now, belong to you.\"\nAfter the Oblivion Crisis, the Hero of Kvatch went on to reclaim the lost &lt;a href=\"Relics%20of%20the%20Crusader%20%28Knights%20of%20the%20Nine%29\"&gt;relics&lt;/a&gt; of the &lt;a href=\"Divine%20Crusader\"&gt;Divine Crusader&lt;/a&gt;, becoming the Divine Crusader, defeating &lt;a href=\"Umaril%20the%20Unfeathered\"&gt;Umaril the Unfeathered&lt;/a&gt; and stopping the &lt;a href=\"Auroran%20Crisis\"&gt;Auroran Crisis&lt;/a&gt;. The Hero of Kvatch also became involved with the &lt;a href=\"Greymarch%20%28Shivering%20Isles%29\"&gt;Greymarch&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;a href=\"Shivering%20Isles\"&gt;Shivering Isles&lt;/a&gt; which caused them to &lt;a href=\"Mantling\"&gt;mantle&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Sheogorath\"&gt;Sheogorath&lt;/a&gt;, becoming the Daedric Prince of Madness.\nSheogorath.\nUpon completion of the official add-on, the Sheogorath seen in falls back into being Jyggalag, and the Hero of Kvatch is crowned as the new Sheogorath quickly afterward. &lt;a href=\"Haskill%20%28Shivering%20Isles%29\"&gt;Haskill&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"Golden%20Saint%20%28Shivering%20Isles%29\"&gt;Aureals&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"Dark%20Seducer%20%28Shivering%20Isles%29\"&gt;Mazken&lt;/a&gt;, and the inhabitants of the Isles will all begin calling the Hero \"Lord Sheogorath.\"\nThe Sheogorath encountered in \"Skyrim\" mentions that he has seen the entire &lt;a href=\"Oblivion%20Crisis\"&gt;Oblivion Crisis&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Martin%20Septim\"&gt;Martin Septim&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"The%20Gray%20Fox%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;Gray Fox&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Mathieu%20Bellamont%27s%20mother\"&gt;Mathieu Bellamont's mother&lt;/a&gt;'s severed head, and that his title gets passed on from \"me to myself,\" implying that he was the Hero of Kvatch."}

Of the three &lt;a href=\"Altmer\"&gt;Altmer&lt;/a&gt; who braved stormy seas, monsters from the deep, and the hostilities of a wild and uncivilized &lt;a href=\"race\"&gt;race&lt;/a&gt; to found a safe port for &lt;a href=\"Summerset\"&gt;Summerset&lt;/a&gt;'s ships along the coast of &lt;a href=\"Valenwood\"&gt;Valenwood&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe tale is timeless. &lt;a href=\"Eldamar\"&gt;Eldamar&lt;/a&gt; was their leader, true-hearted, who envisioned adventure limitless across the sea and would not be deterred when others told him his vision was foolishness. &lt;a href=\"Hirume\"&gt;Hirume&lt;/a&gt; slew the the serpent of the underdepths who guarded that craggy coast, diving deep below the sea to cut out its heart. You will have heard of how she held her breath for a full rising and setting of the sun, even until her companions thought her dead, only to emerge in the wake of the great serpent's demise.Nor will any one ever forget the name of &lt;a href=\"Meluuran\"&gt;Meluuran&lt;/a&gt;, who fashioned a marvelous new sailing vessel specifically for the task, a vessel that cut swiftly across the sea, and did not slow even when the winds died. They say the great craftsman made a deal with &lt;a href=\"the%20Divines\"&gt;the Divines&lt;/a&gt;, or some long forgotten god, to bind the winds and see the ship safely to those foreign shores.And lastly, we tell of how our three heroes reached that hostile shore and found the people there were warlike and feasted on the flesh of their enemies. How their crew clamored to fight the savages and drive them away, a conquered people, but the Heroes of the Sanctuary did not listen to the council of rash and foolish Elves.Instead they met with the leaders of the Wood Elves, and studied their customs. They learned of the &lt;a href=\"Green%20Pact\"&gt;Green Pact&lt;/a&gt;, which forbids damage to the forest, and of the &lt;a href=\"Meat%20Mandate\"&gt;Meat Mandate&lt;/a&gt;, which commands these Elves to eat those they defeat in battle, and most importantly of all, they learned of the &lt;a href=\"Rite%20of%20Theft\"&gt;Rite of Theft&lt;/a&gt;.It was customary that the Wood Elves would steal from each other, and on return of the stolen item, demand a boon commensurate to the item's worth.It happened that the Heroes of the Sanctuary had brought a staff of great value with them. So they made a deal with the Wood Elves. If the Wood Elves could steal the staff from them, they would leave and never return. However, if they could steal an item from each of the Wood Elf &lt;a href=\"treethane\"&gt;treethane&lt;/a&gt;s, then they would be allowed to found a settlement on the shores of Valenwood.The deal was struck, and the Heroes swiftly and cleverly set about stealing from the treethanes. From one they stole a prized bow. Another they tricked into handing over a valued necklace in exchange for \"all of the most valuable thing in the world that they could hold in their hands.\" The most valuable thing in the world, as any one knows, is air\u2014for without it we could not live.At the end of the appointed time, all of the treethanes' items had been stolen, but the Wood Elves had not managed to steal the staff. And that is how &lt;a href=\"Seaside%20Sanctuary\"&gt;Seaside Sanctuary&lt;/a&gt; came to be, thanks to the bravery, cleverness, and vision of Eldamar, Hirume, and Meluuran."}

It is a barren peninsula located on the southern coast of &lt;a href=\"Hammerfell%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Hammerfell&lt;/a&gt;, with the bustling seaport of &lt;a href=\"Abah%27s%20Landing\"&gt;Abah's Landing&lt;/a&gt; as its only settlement. Hew's Bane itself is part of a large region of Hammerfell known as &lt;a href=\"Khefrem\"&gt;Khefrem&lt;/a&gt;.\nBackground.\nHew's Bane was originally colonized by the second wave of &lt;a href=\"Redguards%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Redguards&lt;/a&gt; from the sunken continent of &lt;a href=\"Yokuda\"&gt;Yokuda&lt;/a&gt;, led by &lt;a href=\"Prince%20Hubalajad\"&gt;Prince Hubalajad&lt;/a&gt;, known also as Prince Hew, and is home to the Khefrem Academy of &lt;a href=\"Yokuda\"&gt;Yokuda&lt;/a&gt;n Heritage. Hew's Bane was named as such due to the numerous failures of Hubalajad to colonize the peninsula, with some believing he had invoked the ire of a Yokudan god or &lt;a href=\"Daedric%20Prince\"&gt;Daedric Prince&lt;/a&gt;.\nIn &lt;a href=\"2E%20582\"&gt;2E 582&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"Thieves%20Guild%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Thieves Guild&lt;/a&gt; operated out of the sewers of Abah's Landing. After the Guild attempted to steal the wedding dowry of &lt;a href=\"Magnifica%20Falorah\"&gt;Magnifica Falorah&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"Iron%20Wheel\"&gt;Iron Wheel&lt;/a&gt;, hired by Falorah and led by &lt;a href=\"Chief%20Inspector%20Rhanbiq\"&gt;Chief Inspector Rhanbiq&lt;/a&gt;, occupied the region from the nearby fortress of &lt;a href=\"No%20Shira%20Citadel\"&gt;No Shira Citadel&lt;/a&gt;. Although the heist was a failure, the dowry was still missing, and the Iron Wheel hunted the Thieves Guild in an attempt to recover the dowry and bring the Guild to justice.\nLocations.\nThe following are locations accessible in Hew's Bane and, with the exception of &lt;a href=\"Unmarked%20Locations%20%28Online%29\"&gt;unmarked locations&lt;/a&gt;, are discoverable on the map. Points of Interest serve as locations with unique side quests, while &lt;a href=\"Cities%20%28Online%29\"&gt;cities&lt;/a&gt; serve as the centralised areas with multiple sublocations and act as a hub for services and &lt;a href=\"Merchants%20%28Online%29\"&gt;merchants&lt;/a&gt;. Explanations of the types of locations are provided in the &lt;a href=\"Locations%20%28Online%29%23Types\"&gt;main locations page&lt;/a&gt;.\nQuests.\nHew's Bane features a series of zone story quests and related side quests. Side quests are non-sequential and can be completed in any order, except where one carries on from another. Zone story quests in Hew's Bane require a certain level of Thieves Guild reputation earned from other quests before they can be started, and &lt;a href=\"repeatable%20quests\"&gt;repeatable quests&lt;/a&gt; can be completed multiple times: weekly for arenas and trials and daily for all others.\nItem Sets.\nItem sets are related armor and weapons that, when worn together, provide unique benefits. Overland sets can be acquired from world bosses, world events, delves, public dungeons and containers and as quest rewards; dungeon sets can be acquired from within group dungeons; monster sets can be acquired from the final boss of veteran group dungeons and Undaunted Enclaves; and crafted sets can be created at specific locations across the zone.\nSkyshards.\nSix Skyshards can be found in Hew's Bane totaling in two &lt;a href=\"skill%20points\"&gt;skill points&lt;/a&gt;. The zone guide provides clues as to the location of each Skyshard, but many can be found simply by exploring and watching for the distinctive pillar of light they emit. Skyshards will appear on the map and compass when the Vestige is close to one and will remain discovered on the map even if it was not collected.\nAchievements.\nAchievements can be earned by completing specific tasks include quests and finding locations. Achievements are separated into categories and their progress is viewable from the journal. Earning achievement provides the Vestige some amount of points. Points earned only apply to the character that earned the achievement. Some achievements unlock unique rewards such as trophies or dyes.\nShalidor's Library.\nTwo books that are a part of Shalidor's Library can be found in Hew's Bane and added to the collection. Books that have already been found in other zones will already be marked as completed in the zone tracker.\nFish.\nFish can be caught from fishing hotspots, ideally with the correct &lt;a href=\"bait\"&gt;bait&lt;/a&gt;. Common fish will be caught most often while rare fish and alternative bait are rare catches. Each zone has unique rare fish than can be caught from hotspots. &lt;a href=\"Slaughterfish%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Slaughterfish&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"trodh\"&gt;trodh&lt;/a&gt; can be caught from foul hotspots, &lt;a href=\"dhufish\"&gt;dhufish&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"longfin\"&gt;longfin&lt;/a&gt; can be caught from saltwater hotspots, &lt;a href=\"silverside%20perch\"&gt;silverside perch&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"spadetail\"&gt;spadetail&lt;/a&gt; can be caught from lake hotspots, and &lt;a href=\"Salmon%20%28Online%29\"&gt;salmon&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"River%20Betty%20%28Online%29\"&gt;river betty&lt;/a&gt; can be caught from river hotspots. &lt;a href=\"Chub\"&gt;Chub&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"minnow\"&gt;minnow&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"shad\"&gt;shad&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"fish%20roe\"&gt;fish roe&lt;/a&gt; can be caught and used as bait from foul, saltwater, lake and river hotspots, respectively."}

The killing of the vampire has to be completed without any citizens or guards seeing it or being alerted. However, the targets can be persuaded to follow the Dragonborn to a more secluded location, with the exception of the advisor, who must be killed with risk of a bounty.\nStrategies.\nOption A.\nThe first option is to convince the target to follow the Dragonborn with a high enough &lt;a href=\"Speech\"&gt;Speech&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Skills%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;skill&lt;/a&gt; (not an option for advisors). If the Dragonborn persuades or intimidates them to follow, they can lure the target to a hidden place and kill them there. One easy way is to lure the target out of the town they spawn in and take them a good distance away from it. After a certain distance, the target will turn around and start to walk back, leaving the Dragonborn a chance to go into &lt;a href=\"Sneak%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Sneak&lt;/a&gt; and stealth kill the vampire while their back is turned, thus avoiding incurring a &lt;a href=\"Bounty%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;bounty&lt;/a&gt; and completing the objective to discreetly kill the target.\nOption B.\nThe second option is to kill them from a hidden location. This is best done with a high &lt;a href=\"Sneak%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Sneak&lt;/a&gt; skill.\nOption C.\nThe third option is to use a hidden identity by transforming. Go to a hidden location and then transform into a &lt;a href=\"Lycanthropy%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;werewolf&lt;/a&gt; or a &lt;a href=\"Vampire%20Lord\"&gt;Vampire Lord&lt;/a&gt;, if available. Everyone will become hostile to the Dragonborn, but their identity will be hidden and they can kill the target and then flee before taking too much damage from attacking citizens and guards.\nOption D.\nIf the Dragonborn's &lt;a href=\"Illusion%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Illusion&lt;/a&gt; skill is high enough, the &lt;a href=\"Fury%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Fury&lt;/a&gt; spell can be used to cause the target to become hostile to everyone; this will cause the guards to attack the target and kill them. A Fortify Illusion potion can help get the Fury spell to work, but the guards can come after the caster. Using the Quiet Caster perk can also mitigate being detected after using Fury.\nOption E.\nIf one can get far enough away, sneak, and shoot them with a bow (while unseen), they will look and chase after the Dragonborn. Lead the vampire away from any possible witnesses, and then kill them.\u00a0\nOption F.\nUse the \"&lt;a href=\"Conjure%20Flaming%20Familiar\"&gt;Conjure Flaming Familiar&lt;/a&gt;\" spell from the quest \"&lt;a href=\"A%20Scroll%20For%20Anska\"&gt;A Scroll For Anska&lt;/a&gt;.\"\nOption G.\nTravel to the location at night, and wait for vampires to attack. They will be hostile towards the vampire and can be led towards him."}

However, Ayrenn went missing, and disappeared somewhere between the Palace and the Tower.\nHidellith's son Naemon was then named heir to the throne.

{"id": "10852", "revid": "17401442", "url": "https://elderscrolls.fandom.com/wiki?curid=10852", "title": "Hiding with the Shadow", "text": "Hiding with the Shadow is a &lt;a href=\"Books%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;book&lt;/a&gt; in .\nContents.\nThere are few professions that require the practitioner to be more self-reliant than that of &lt;a href=\"Thief%20%28Class%29\"&gt;thief&lt;/a&gt;. A thief is by nature a loner. He trusts no one and is trusted by few. He cannot go to a master and become an apprentice. He has no guild to collect and codify how to ply his craft. He does his crimes alone, and in the dark of night. He must hide by day to avoid capture by the authorities.\nThe only known deity recognized by thieves is &lt;a href=\"Nocturnal\"&gt;Nocturnal&lt;/a&gt;. Not truly a goddess, this &lt;a href=\"Daedric%20Princes\"&gt;Daedric lord&lt;/a&gt; is none-the-less a potent figure. She is the Mistress of Shadows, holding sway over secrets and stealth. She does not ask for worshippers, nor does she necessarily give blessings to those that do recognize her. In fact there are no known temples to her in &lt;a href=\"Cyrodiil\"&gt;Cyrodiil&lt;/a&gt;, although there are rumors of a forgotten &lt;a href=\"Shrine%20of%20Nocturnal%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;shrine&lt;/a&gt;. In other words, she is perfectly suited to the criminal mind of the thief.\nBy and large, thieves are a godless lot. They believe only in their own skills and cunning. However, since the existence and influence of the gods and Daedric lords is undeniable, they have an uneasy relationship with Nocturnal. Though some thieves truly worship her, most choose to offer their respect and reverence without fealty.\nThese criminals recognize that should they offend the Mistress of Shadows, it might go poorly for them. However, true worship and fealty does not have any known benefit. The classic blessing between thieves is \"shadow hide you.\" This is an oblique reference to Nocturnal. However it can also be interpreted to be a non-theistic statement of actual shadows hiding the thief.\nThieves tend to dress in black clothes or dark clothing. While this is a practical thing for their criminal endeavors, it is unnecessary during the daylight hours. Yet many thieves still don these shadowy colors in silent recognition of Nocturnal.\nThe most shocking link between the nebulous culture of thieves and Nocturnal, is the tale of the &lt;a href=\"The%20Gray%20Fox%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;Gray Fox&lt;/a&gt;. He is the &lt;a href=\"Thieves%20Guild%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;mythical king of thieves&lt;/a&gt;. The legend states that he stole the &lt;a href=\"Gray%20Cowl%20of%20Nocturnal%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;hood off of Nocturnal's cloak&lt;/a&gt;. Obviously this is just a story invented centuries ago to bolster their feelings of self-worth. However, it is indicative of the continued link between the Daedric lord and the criminals of the &lt;a href=\"Septim%20Empire\"&gt;Empire&lt;/a&gt;."}

He worked in secret with &lt;a href=\"Vuhon\"&gt;Vuhon&lt;/a&gt; to bring &lt;a href=\"Umbriel\"&gt;Umbriel&lt;/a&gt; to the &lt;a href=\"Imperial%20City\"&gt;Imperial City&lt;/a&gt;, planning to turn on him so he could siphon off the souls the city collected once it reached the &lt;a href=\"White-Gold%20Tower\"&gt;White-Gold Tower&lt;/a&gt;. Hierem was an odd, pudgy man with thick eyebrows and mild blue eyes.\nHistory.\nEarly &lt;a href=\"Fourth%20Era\"&gt;Fourth Era&lt;/a&gt;.\nHierem grew up in an old Nibenese family. He was in the leadership of the &lt;a href=\"Mages%20Guild\"&gt;Mages Guild&lt;/a&gt;, before the organization utterly collapsed. He had a position in the &lt;a href=\"Septim%20Empire\"&gt;Septim Empire&lt;/a&gt;, he was an ambassador to &lt;a href=\"Morrowind\"&gt;Morrowind&lt;/a&gt;. He was later a minister to &lt;a href=\"Thules%20the%20Gibbering\"&gt;Thules the Gibbering&lt;/a&gt;. When Titus Mede I took the throne, he was one of his main supports. He was also extremely influential with the &lt;a href=\"Synod\"&gt;Synod&lt;/a&gt;.\n&lt;a href=\"Umbriel%20Crisis\"&gt;Umbriel Crisis&lt;/a&gt;.\nHierem was present when Prince &lt;a href=\"Attrebus%20Mede\"&gt;Attrebus&lt;/a&gt; requested his father to demand his legions to attack Umbriel in &lt;a href=\"Black%20Marsh\"&gt;Black Marsh&lt;/a&gt;. Titus disregarded Attrebus' proposal because it did not concern the &lt;a href=\"Empire\"&gt;Empire&lt;/a&gt;. Hierem pointed out that the &lt;a href=\"Argonians\"&gt;Argonians&lt;/a&gt; had refused the Empire's protection. He revealed that they had already been informed by reports, &lt;a href=\"The%20Synod\"&gt;The Synod&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"College%20of%20Whispers\"&gt;College of Whispers&lt;/a&gt; had been tasked to collect information, but they would not send a military expedition until Umbriel threated their borders.\nAttrebus decided to disobey the Emperor's will, so he ordered &lt;a href=\"Gulan\"&gt;Gulan&lt;/a&gt; to gather his men at &lt;a href=\"Ione\"&gt;Ione&lt;/a&gt;. Gulan informed to the Emperor every time Attrebus went on an adventure. Attrebus believed he was a hero, but in fact, he was only allowed to take part in battles were he heavily outnumbered the enemy. This time, however, he reported Attrebus' intentions in the office of the prime minister.\nInspector &lt;a href=\"Colin\"&gt;Colin&lt;/a&gt; investigated a woman named &lt;a href=\"Letine%20Arese\"&gt;Letine Arese&lt;/a&gt; working in Hierem's office. He was caught by her men spying on her. Colin was captured and brought to Arese, but she killed her men and revealed Colin a tattoo of a wolf\u2019s head, the Emperor's personal brand. She had been placed in the minister's office to spy on him. Arese explained that Hierem wanted the prince dead, but she did not know why.\nColin discovered that Hierem's ministry had censored some reports dealing with &lt;a href=\"Black%20Marsh\"&gt;Black Marsh&lt;/a&gt;. Hierem had made a secret trip to Black Marsh the past year, apparently to negotiate with the &lt;a href=\"An-Xileel\"&gt;An-Xileel&lt;/a&gt; leaders. He had hired a merchant ship and traveled in disguise. Colin suspected that Hierem had summoned &lt;a href=\"Umbriel\"&gt;Umbriel&lt;/a&gt; into &lt;a href=\"Tamriel\"&gt;Tamriel&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href=\"Delia%20Huerc\"&gt;Delia Huerc&lt;/a&gt; had accompanied Hierem to Black Marsh, but she had died a short time after the trip due to an illness.\nDelia's journal revealed that Hierem had done a ritual in the &lt;a href=\"Hist\"&gt;Hist&lt;/a&gt; tree of &lt;a href=\"Lilmoth\"&gt;Lilmoth&lt;/a&gt;. He repeated the word Umbriel several times. Colin informed the Emperor about Hierem's involvement in the murder of the prince and the summoning of the flying city. The Emperor answered that Hierem had shown him proofs that it was Arese who plotted against his son. The Emperor asked Colin to find real proof of Hierem's treason, he could not afford loosing the minister's influence. Finally, he provided the inspector a key to Hierem's room.\nColin infiltrate in the minister's chambers and found a paper with Umbriel writen on it. He copied some schemes and drawings as best as he could.\nAttrebus was caught by Hierem's men while he tried to enter the Imperial City. Sul and him woke up in his chambers, locked up in two cells. Hierem recognized to Attrebus he was in league with &lt;a href=\"Vuhon\"&gt;Vuhon&lt;/a&gt;. Vuhon wanted Sul and Attrebus alive. Hierem planned to betray Umbriel and pretend to save the Imperial City, after the Emperor had failed. He would accuse Attrebus of treason. Hierem did not trust Umbriel would fulfill his word, but he would not honor his terms either. Hierem interrogated Attrebus torturing him with a spell that made him wept in ecstasy. He wanted to know why Umbriel was afraid of them, if they knew how to kill him he could use their knowledge for his own purposes. They told him &lt;a href=\"Umbra\"&gt;Umbra&lt;/a&gt; could be used to defeat Umbriel, so Hierem mentioned the possibility to give them the sword and let them kill Umbriel.\nHierem teleported himself to Umbriel. In the meantime, Colin and Letine entered Hierem's quarters. They discovered the prince captive, who informed them about Hierem's plan. Colin forced the lock, and they made a plan. Sul and Attrebus would wait in the sigil that teleported Hierem to Umbriel, while Colin and Arese waited for him in his chambers. When Hierem returned, Attrebus and Sul would be teleported to Umbriel.\nWhen Hierem appeared, Colin thrusted his knife toward the base of his skull. Yet, he did not intend to kill the minister, he wanted to interrogate him. Colin felt a sob heave up from his chest, then he slumped down to the floor. Arese summoned a &lt;a href=\"daedra\"&gt;daedra&lt;/a&gt; who attacked Hierem. The daedra wounded him severly, but he managed to defeat it. When he was about to kill Arese, Colin threw a knife at Hierem. Hierem noticed Colin's attack, and he dodged the knife. While Hierem was distracted with Colin another daedra butchered Hierem ending with his life. It is later revealed that Hierem expected to use the &lt;a href=\"White-Gold%20Tower\"&gt;White-Gold Tower&lt;/a&gt; to make him a god."}

High Hrothgar is the home of the &lt;a href=\"Greybeards\"&gt;Greybeards&lt;/a&gt;, a group of powerful monks that dedicate their lives to studying the &lt;a href=\"Way%20of%20the%20Voice\"&gt;Way of the Voice&lt;/a&gt;.\nDescription.\nGeography.\nHigh Hrothgar is located on the peaks of the &lt;a href=\"Throat%20of%20the%20World\"&gt;Throat of the World&lt;/a&gt;, perhaps the largest mountain in Tamriel. This was done to isolate themselves from the rest of the province in the effort to study quietly and without disturbance. The only way to reach High Hrothgar was through the small town of &lt;a href=\"Ivarstead\"&gt;Ivarstead&lt;/a&gt;, located on the Western edge of &lt;a href=\"the%20Rift\"&gt;the Rift&lt;/a&gt;. Ivarstead is the beginning of &lt;a href=\"The%20Seven%20Thousand%20Steps\"&gt;The Seven Thousand Steps&lt;/a&gt;, a long spiraling road on the Snow Tower that leads to the temple. Along the path are several etched tablets that describe the origins of &lt;a href=\"Man\"&gt;Man&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Dragon%20War\"&gt;Dragon War&lt;/a&gt;. High Hrothgar has a decent sized courtyard in the back and a pathway that leads to the Summit. The Inner Temple is dark and cold, the winter breeze seeps into the walls and leaves a hollowing echo across the hallways.\nHistory.\n&lt;a href=\"First%20Era\"&gt;First Era&lt;/a&gt;.\nDuring the First Era, the &lt;a href=\"Nordic%20Empire\"&gt;Nordic Empire&lt;/a&gt; was present at the &lt;a href=\"Battle%20of%20Red%20Mountain\"&gt;Battle of Red Mountain&lt;/a&gt;, a momentous event for the many denizens of Northern Tamriel, same goes for the &lt;a href=\"Nords\"&gt;Nords&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href=\"Jurgen%20Windcaller\"&gt;Jurgen Windcaller&lt;/a&gt; was one of the &lt;a href=\"Tongues\"&gt;Tongues&lt;/a&gt;, a warrior capable of using the &lt;a href=\"Voice\"&gt;Voice&lt;/a&gt; and he utilized this ability in his campaign in &lt;a href=\"Red%20Mountain\"&gt;Red Mountain&lt;/a&gt;. However, after the Battle and the loss of his men, Jurgen began to undergo seven years of meditation to learn why the power of the Voice had failed him in &lt;a href=\"Resdayn\"&gt;Resdayn&lt;/a&gt;. Jurgen built High Hrothgar as a place to hone his skills and to undergo his meditation. He eventually took on disciples and &lt;a href=\"the%20Greybeards\"&gt;the Greybeards&lt;/a&gt; was formed. Jurgen would later pass away and be buried in the ruins of &lt;a href=\"Ustengrav\"&gt;Ustengrav&lt;/a&gt;. His teachings would be passed on for generations.\nAt one point, the 418th Step to High Hrothgar was destroyed by a &lt;a href=\"Dragons%20%28Lore%29\"&gt;Dragon&lt;/a&gt;. It was repaired by &lt;a href=\"King%20Wulfharth\"&gt;King Wulfharth&lt;/a&gt;. This moment was recorded in the \"&lt;a href=\"Five%20Songs%20of%20King%20Wulfharth\"&gt;Five Songs of King Wulfharth&lt;/a&gt;\", along with defeating the &lt;a href=\"Orc\"&gt;Orc&lt;/a&gt;ish chieftain of the eastern Orcs and swallowing a thundercloud, so his men would not catch a cold. This reference to High Hrothgar may be apocryphal, as though Wulfharth has been revived several times, this episode took place before his original death, more than 200 years before Jurgen Windcaller's birth and the battle at Red Mountain.\n&lt;a href=\"Second%20Era\"&gt;Second Era&lt;/a&gt;.\nDuring the &lt;a href=\"Interregnum\"&gt;Interregnum&lt;/a&gt;, the Greybeards of Hrothgar were uninvolved with the matters of the &lt;a href=\"Alliance%20War\"&gt;Alliance War&lt;/a&gt; nor the &lt;a href=\"Ebonheart%20Pact\"&gt;Ebonheart Pact&lt;/a&gt;.

When he heard the news, he traveled to High Hrothgar to seek aid from the Greybeards, to stop the Akaviri before it is too late. The Greybeards conjured the shade of Wulfharth the Ash-King to help him defeat the Kamal. Jorunn and Wulfharth built an army in the city of &lt;a href=\"Riften\"&gt;Riften&lt;/a&gt;, which the Akaviri avoided, they entered the &lt;a href=\"Stonefalls\"&gt;Stonefalls&lt;/a&gt; region in &lt;a href=\"Morrowind\"&gt;Morrowind&lt;/a&gt; to reach the city of &lt;a href=\"Mournhold\"&gt;Mournhold&lt;/a&gt; in Central &lt;a href=\"Deshaan%20Plains\"&gt;Deshaan&lt;/a&gt;. The war continued in Stonefalls in the infamous &lt;a href=\"Battle%20of%20Stonefalls\"&gt;Battle of Stonefalls&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe Greybeards had foreseen the coming of the &lt;a href=\"Third%20Empire\"&gt;Third Empire&lt;/a&gt; for quite some time. A New &lt;a href=\"Emperor\"&gt;Emperor&lt;/a&gt; that would defeat the &lt;a href=\"High%20Elves\"&gt;High Elves&lt;/a&gt; of the &lt;a href=\"Summerset%20Isles\"&gt;Summerset Isles&lt;/a&gt; and would unite the continent under a single banner. Wulfharth overheard this and traveled to High Hrothgar, assuming that he was this chosen person. When he spoke with the Greybeards, they shattered him, reducing him back to ash. He was not the chosen one; it was a man from the island kingdom of &lt;a href=\"Alcaire\"&gt;Alcaire&lt;/a&gt;. This warrior youth was &lt;a href=\"Hjalti%20Early-Beard\"&gt;Hjalti Early-Beard&lt;/a&gt;, a warrior under &lt;a href=\"Cuhlecain\"&gt;King Cuhlecain&lt;/a&gt;, the leader of &lt;a href=\"Falkreath\"&gt;Falkreath&lt;/a&gt;. Hjalti would later follow Cuhlecain to &lt;a href=\"Cyrodiil\"&gt;Cyrodiil&lt;/a&gt; as Cuhlecain would become the Emperor of Tamriel, Emperor Zero. Cuhlecain would later be assassinated, and Hjalti assumed the throne as &lt;a href=\"Tiber%20Septim\"&gt;Tiber Septim&lt;/a&gt;.\n&lt;a href=\"Third%20Era\"&gt;Third Era&lt;/a&gt;.\nAround the time of the &lt;a href=\"Oblivion%20Crisis\"&gt;Oblivion Crisis&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"3E%20433\"&gt;3E 433&lt;/a&gt;, the settlements of &lt;a href=\"Whiterun\"&gt;Whiterun&lt;/a&gt; and Hrothgar was under constant attack ranging from the &lt;a href=\"Horme\"&gt;Horme&lt;/a&gt; Bandits and the &lt;a href=\"Frost%20Troll\"&gt;Frost Troll&lt;/a&gt;s of the northern mountains. The raging blizzards of the north did not make the situation any better.\n&lt;a href=\"Fourth%20Era\"&gt;Fourth Era&lt;/a&gt;.\nAmidst the &lt;a href=\"Dragon%20Crisis\"&gt;Dragon Crisis&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"4E%20201\"&gt;4E 201&lt;/a&gt;, the Greybeards of High Hrothgar called to the &lt;a href=\"Dovahkiin\"&gt;Dovahkiin&lt;/a&gt; after they revealed themselves by slaying the &lt;a href=\"Dragons%20%28Lore%29\"&gt;Dragon&lt;/a&gt; known as &lt;a href=\"Mirmulnir\"&gt;Mirmulnir&lt;/a&gt; outside of Whiterun. The Last Dragonborn traveled to Ivarstead and climbed the Seven Thousand Steps to speak with the Greybeards themselves. The leader of the Greybeards, &lt;a href=\"Arngeir\"&gt;Arngeir&lt;/a&gt; taught the Dragonborn in the Way of the Voice, to help them defeat the rising threat of &lt;a href=\"Alduin\"&gt;Alduin&lt;/a&gt;. Eventually, the Dragonborn had mastered the voice and continued to climb the Throat of the World to the summit. There he met, &lt;a href=\"Paarthurnax\"&gt;Paarthurnax&lt;/a&gt;, the true leader of the Greybeards and a reformed general of the Dragon War of ye old.\nThe Dragonborn needed to learn the shout that could bring a Dragon down from the sky, a shout called the &lt;a href=\"Dragonrend\"&gt;Dragonrend&lt;/a&gt;. They traveled to the northern snow lands of &lt;a href=\"Winterhold%20%28Skyrim%20Hold%29\"&gt;Winterhold&lt;/a&gt; to find the &lt;a href=\"Elder%20Scroll%20%28Dragon%29\"&gt;Elder Scroll&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Alftand\"&gt;Alftand&lt;/a&gt;. With the Elder Scrolls, the Dragonborn manipulated the &lt;a href=\"Time%20Wound\"&gt;Time Wound&lt;/a&gt; at the summit to learn the words for Dragonrend. After they have learned it, &lt;a href=\"Alduin\"&gt;Alduin&lt;/a&gt; himself appeared and dueled the Dragonborn in a Battle of Tongues. He was defeated and fled to &lt;a href=\"Skuldafn\"&gt;Skuldafn&lt;/a&gt; and eventually &lt;a href=\"Sovngarde\"&gt;Sovngarde&lt;/a&gt; where he was actually defeated by the Dragonborn."}

It is here the ancient &lt;a href=\"Greybeards\"&gt;Greybeards&lt;/a&gt; reside, living in absolute silence to better attune themselves to the voice of the sky.\nSeven Thousand Steps.\nThe act of climbing the &lt;a href=\"Seven%20Thousand%20Steps\"&gt;Seven Thousand Steps&lt;/a&gt; holds a spiritual significance for many &lt;a href=\"Nords%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Nords&lt;/a&gt; due to the belief that &lt;a href=\"Men\"&gt;Men&lt;/a&gt; were created by &lt;a href=\"Kyne\"&gt;Kyne&lt;/a&gt; on this mountain when the sky breathed onto the land. This belief has led to pilgrims from all across &lt;a href=\"Tamriel\"&gt;Tamriel&lt;/a&gt; traveling to the Throat of the World, and several may be encountered along the mountain path either meditating or studying the etched tablets.\nThe path leading to High Hrothgar begins in the village of &lt;a href=\"Ivarstead%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Ivarstead&lt;/a&gt;\u2014across the main bridge in the northwest side of town. The mountain path itself is treacherous and is host to a multitude of dangerous creatures such as &lt;a href=\"Frost%20Troll%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;frost trolls&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Ice%20Wraith%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;ice wraiths&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Snow%20Bear%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;snow bears&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Ice%20Wolf%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;ice wolves&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Frostbite%20Spider%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Frostbite Spiders&lt;/a&gt; and occasionally &lt;a href=\"Dragons%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;dragons&lt;/a&gt;.\nEtched tablet emblems.\nThere are ten Etched Tablets along the trail telling of the founding of High Hrothgar. Reading them all will grant the &lt;a href=\"Voice%20of%20the%20Sky\"&gt;Voice of the Sky&lt;/a&gt; passive &lt;a href=\"Abilities%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;ability&lt;/a&gt;.\nInterior.\nBanners.\nThere are banners hanging throughout the interior of High Hrothgar. Despite how many hang, there are only two separate phrases written on them and the positioning when they are first encountered seems to indicate they are meant to be paired. In the picture, the one on the left reads \"LOK BO\" and the one on the right reads \"THuuM TuuM.\" Unfortunately, a complete translation cannot be made as not enough of the language is known to translate it from simply 'reading into it'. We do, however, know that LOK is 'Sky' and THuuM (Thu'um) is 'Shout' or 'Storm Voice'. Therefore, it is likely that the banners translate to the phrase that Arngeir frequently speaks to the &lt;a href=\"Last%20Dragonborn\"&gt;Dragonborn&lt;/a&gt; after they engage with or leave conversation with him: \"Sky above, voice within.\"\nCourtyard.\nThe courtyard of High Hrothgar can be accessed from within the temple. The courtyard itself is relatively sparse, with only a few trees and stone pillars. A large double gate is off to one side where the Greybeards practice the &lt;a href=\"Whirlwind%20Sprint\"&gt;Whirlwind Sprint&lt;/a&gt; shout. A large tower dominates the opposite end, where Arngeir occasionally meditates at the top. Occasionally, one of the Greybeards will meditate by the cliffside\u2014he will stand up to shout at the sky, then continue meditating.\nThe path to the summit of the &lt;a href=\"Throat%20of%20the%20World%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Throat of the World&lt;/a&gt; is also accessible from the courtyard, but will initially be blocked by a powerful wind barrier. The only way to disperse the barrier is with the &lt;a href=\"Clear%20Skies\"&gt;Clear Skies&lt;/a&gt; shout.\nQuests.\n&lt;a href=\"The%20Way%20of%20the%20Voice\"&gt;The Way of the Voice&lt;/a&gt;.\nAfter the completion of &lt;a href=\"Dragon%20Rising\"&gt;Dragon Rising&lt;/a&gt;, a powerful shout will be heard from the mountains close to &lt;a href=\"Whiterun%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Whiterun&lt;/a&gt;. Upon talking to &lt;a href=\"Jarl\"&gt;Jarl&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Balgruuf\"&gt;Balgruuf&lt;/a&gt;, it is revealed that the shout was uttered by the &lt;a href=\"Greybeards\"&gt;Greybeards&lt;/a&gt;, summoning the &lt;a href=\"Last%20Dragonborn\"&gt;Dragonborn&lt;/a&gt; to High Hrothgar.\n&lt;a href=\"Climb%20The%20Steps\"&gt;Climb The Steps&lt;/a&gt;.\nAt the base of the steps, there is a man called &lt;a href=\"Klimmek\"&gt;Klimmek&lt;/a&gt; with supplies meant to be taken up to the Greybeards. These supplies can be delivered to the chest outside High Hrothgar for a leveled amount of upon return.\n&lt;a href=\"Season%20Unending\"&gt;Season Unending&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe Dragonborn must get &lt;a href=\"Ulfric%20Stormcloak\"&gt;Ulfric Stormcloak&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"General%20Tullius\"&gt;General Tullius&lt;/a&gt; to negotiate a truce before either &lt;a href=\"Balgruuf\"&gt;Balgruuf&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"Vignar%20Gray-Mane\"&gt;Vignar Gray-Mane&lt;/a&gt; (whichever one is Jarl) will help them stop Alduin."}

It consists of two inhabited islands: High Isle, the largest island of the &lt;a href=\"The%20Systres\"&gt;Systres Archipelago&lt;/a&gt;, and Amenos, a prison jungle colony in the northeast. The south coast city of &lt;a href=\"Gonfalon%20Bay\"&gt;Gonfalon Bay&lt;/a&gt; on High Isle acts as the major metropolitan center for the two islands.\nBackground.\nHigh Isle and Amenos, as with the rest of the archipelago, was first settled by the &lt;a href=\"Druids%20of%20Galen\"&gt;Druids of Galen&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"1E%20330\"&gt;1E 330&lt;/a&gt; escaping the hostile &lt;a href=\"Direnni%20Hegemony\"&gt;Direnni Hegemony&lt;/a&gt; that regarded them as a threat due to their advocacy of druidic governance over &lt;a href=\"High%20Rock%20%28Online%29\"&gt;High Rock&lt;/a&gt;, as well as the &lt;a href=\"Alessian%20Order\"&gt;Alessian Order&lt;/a&gt; who regarded them as \"Meriphilic heretics.\" &lt;a href=\"Pieron%20Desant\"&gt;Pieron Desant&lt;/a&gt; of the &lt;a href=\"Gleaners%20of%20Aurbis\"&gt;Gleaners of Aurbis&lt;/a&gt; travelled to High Isle for a heist during the &lt;a href=\"Interregnum\"&gt;Interregnum&lt;/a&gt;, and brought back a valuable haul to &lt;a href=\"Fargrave\"&gt;Fargrave&lt;/a&gt;.\nDuring the time of the &lt;a href=\"All%20Flags%20Navy\"&gt;All Flags Navy&lt;/a&gt; circa &lt;a href=\"1E%202200\"&gt;1E 2200&lt;/a&gt;, High Isle was used as a staging area for the assault against &lt;a href=\"Thras\"&gt;Thras&lt;/a&gt;, with &lt;a href=\"All%20Flags%20Islet\"&gt;All Flags Islet&lt;/a&gt; in the island's center used as the Navy's centralized point of command and control. In &lt;a href=\"2E%20582\"&gt;2E 582&lt;/a&gt;, the islands are occupied by both druidic and chivalric &lt;a href=\"Bretons%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Bretons&lt;/a&gt;, with the druids, particularly of the &lt;a href=\"Stonelore%20Circle\"&gt;Stonelore Circle&lt;/a&gt;, living in central wilderness, and the House Bretons occupying various coastal settlements under the governance of &lt;a href=\"House%20Dufort\"&gt;House Dufort&lt;/a&gt;. The island of Amenos, unlike High Isle, is a largely uninhabited jungle used by the House Bretons as a penal colony.\nLocations.\nThe following are locations accessible in High Isle and Amenos and, with the exception of &lt;a href=\"Unmarked%20Locations%20%28Online%29\"&gt;unmarked locations&lt;/a&gt;, are discoverable on the map. Points of Interest serve as locations with unique side quests, while &lt;a href=\"Cities%20%28Online%29\"&gt;cities&lt;/a&gt; serve as the centralised areas with multiple sublocations and act as a hub for services and &lt;a href=\"Merchants%20%28Online%29\"&gt;merchants&lt;/a&gt;. Explanations of the types of locations are provided in the &lt;a href=\"Locations%20%28Online%29%23Types\"&gt;main locations page&lt;/a&gt;.\nQuests.\nHigh Isle and Amenos features a series of zone story quests and unrelated side quests. The zone story quests tie into the &lt;a href=\"Legacy%20of%20the%20Bretons\"&gt;Legacy of the Bretons&lt;/a&gt; overarching storyline and continues on to &lt;a href=\"Galen%20and%20Y%27ffelon\"&gt;Galen and Y'ffelon&lt;/a&gt;, but it is not necessary to complete the story quests for zones prior to those in High Isle and Amenos. Side quests are non-sequential and can be completed in any order, except where one carries on from another, and &lt;a href=\"repeatable%20quests\"&gt;repeatable quests&lt;/a&gt; can be completed multiple times: weekly for arenas and trials and daily for all others.\nItem Sets.\nItem sets are related armor and weapons that, when worn together, provide unique benefits. Overland sets can be acquired from world bosses, world events, delves, public dungeons and containers and as quest rewards; dungeon sets can be acquired from within group dungeons; monster sets can be acquired from the final boss of veteran group dungeons and Undaunted Enclaves; and crafted sets can be created at specific locations across the zone.\nSkyshards.\nEighteen Skyshards can be found in High Isle and Amenos totaling in six &lt;a href=\"skill%20points\"&gt;skill points&lt;/a&gt;. The zone guide provides clues as to the location of each Skyshard, but many can be found simply by exploring and watching for the distinctive pillar of light they emit. Skyshards will appear on the map and compass when the Vestige is close to one and will remain discovered on the map even if it was not collected.\nAchievements.\nAchievements can be earned by completing specific tasks such as completing quests and discovering locations. Achievements are separated into categories and their progress is viewable from the journal. Earning achievement provides the Vestige a number of points, and some achievements unlock unique rewards such as &lt;a href=\"Furnishings%20%28Online%29\"&gt;furnishings&lt;/a&gt; that can be bought from Achievement Furnishers or &lt;a href=\"collectibles\"&gt;collectibles&lt;/a&gt;.\nShalidor's Library.\nTen books that are a part of Shalidor's Library can be found in High Isle and Amenos and added to the collection. Books that have already been found in other zones will already be marked as completed in the zone tracker.\nFish.\nFish can be caught from fishing hotspots, ideally with the correct &lt;a href=\"bait\"&gt;bait&lt;/a&gt;. Common fish will be caught most often while rare fish and alternative bait are rare catches.

In the event that no direct heir to the throne exists, High Kings are selected by a &lt;a href=\"moot\"&gt;moot&lt;/a&gt;, or vote, conducted by the current &lt;a href=\"Jarl\"&gt;Jarl&lt;/a&gt;s of each of the nine &lt;a href=\"Holds\"&gt;Holds&lt;/a&gt;. High Kings are traditionally either related to the previous High King, or a Jarl of one of the Holds. Votes occur most commonly when the previous High King dies. By Nordic tradition, a High King can be challenged in a duel by one of the Jarls. If they refuse, the challenger has grounds to call for a moot to elect a new High King.\nThe High King swears fealty to the &lt;a href=\"Emperor\"&gt;Emperor&lt;/a&gt;, and as such &lt;a href=\"Solitude\"&gt;Solitude&lt;/a&gt; is the city most directly influenced by Imperial culture and politics; thus the Jarl of Solitude has served as High King for generations. According to some source the Moot is, therefore, more formality and theater than anything else. Other sources state that the Moot always meets to select a new High King. Originally, the High King was based in &lt;a href=\"Windhelm\"&gt;Windhelm&lt;/a&gt;, as it was the first capital city established by &lt;a href=\"Ysgramor\"&gt;Ysgramor&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;a href=\"Merethic%20Era\"&gt;Merethic Era&lt;/a&gt;. The Capital had also shifted to &lt;a href=\"Winterhold\"&gt;Winterhold&lt;/a&gt; sometime in the &lt;a href=\"First%20Era\"&gt;First Era&lt;/a&gt;, but as of the &lt;a href=\"Fourth%20Era\"&gt;Fourth Era&lt;/a&gt;, the High King reigns from &lt;a href=\"Solitude%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Solitude&lt;/a&gt;.\nHistory.\nSecond Era.\nAs a result of the &lt;a href=\"Reman%20Empire\"&gt;Reman Empire&lt;/a&gt;'s fall in &lt;a href=\"2E%20431\"&gt;2E 431&lt;/a&gt;, High King &lt;a href=\"Logrolf\"&gt;Logrolf&lt;/a&gt; was assassinated. When Jarl &lt;a href=\"Svartr\"&gt;Svartr&lt;/a&gt; claimed his daughter &lt;a href=\"Freydis\"&gt;Freydis&lt;/a&gt; was illegitimate, a partial moot in Windhelm convened Freydis was High Queen, while a partial moot in Solitude convened Svartr was High king. As a result, the province was split into the West and East kingdoms, ruled separately by each High Kings of the capitals. In &lt;a href=\"2E%20582\"&gt;2E 582&lt;/a&gt;, High King &lt;a href=\"Svargrim\"&gt;Svargrim&lt;/a&gt; ruled the West Kingdom until his death in in that year, while High King &lt;a href=\"Jorunn%20the%20Skald-King\"&gt;Jorunn the Skald-King&lt;/a&gt; ruled the East Kingdom.\nFourth Era.\nIn the &lt;a href=\"Fourth%20Era\"&gt;Fourth Era&lt;/a&gt;, upon the death of High King &lt;a href=\"Torygg\"&gt;Torygg&lt;/a&gt;, the Jarls could not agree on the next High King. Torygg's widow, &lt;a href=\"Elisif%20the%20Fair\"&gt;Elisif the Fair&lt;/a&gt;, the Jarl of Solitude, had a legitimate claim to the throne. However, according to &lt;a href=\"Ulfric%20Stormcloak\"&gt;Ulfric Stormcloak&lt;/a&gt;, the Jarl of &lt;a href=\"Windhelm%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Windhelm&lt;/a&gt;, ancient Nord tradition dictates that when the High King is bested in battle, the winner can call a Moot to have a new High King chosen. Ulfric believed this gave him a stronger claim to the throne. This resulted in &lt;a href=\"Skyrim%20Civil%20War\"&gt;Civil War&lt;/a&gt; because the Empire considered the duel unfair and an act of murder, due to Ulfric's use of the &lt;a href=\"Thu%27um\"&gt;Thu'um&lt;/a&gt;. It is strongly implied that Ulfric initiated the challenge, plotting to intimidate the other Jarls into naming him High King, though Ulfric and his supporters maintained it was a lawful challenge to prove Torygg's weakness as a leader and Skyrim's wretched condition. However, if the city of &lt;a href=\"Battle%20for%20Solitude\"&gt;Solitude is taken&lt;/a&gt; by the &lt;a href=\"Stormcloaks\"&gt;Stormcloaks&lt;/a&gt; and the war resolved in their favor, Ulfric's earlier statement is proven true; saying he supports the decision of the Moot, whether he is crowned King or not. However, he still asks Elisif to swear fealty to him, and all Jarls who fought against him are replaced.\nPrevious rulers.\nListed below are the previous High Kings and High Queens of &lt;a href=\"Skyrim\"&gt;Skyrim&lt;/a&gt; followed by their respective reigns:\nThe Jagged Crown.\n&lt;a href=\"The%20Jagged%20Crown%20%28Item%29\"&gt;The Jagged Crown&lt;/a&gt; is the crown of the High King of &lt;a href=\"Skyrim\"&gt;Skyrim&lt;/a&gt; and was used to symbolizes the power over Skyrim. It is made from the teeth and bones of &lt;a href=\"Dragons%20%28Lore%29\"&gt;dragons&lt;/a&gt;. It is believed to date back to the time of &lt;a href=\"Harald\"&gt;King Harald&lt;/a&gt; and is said to contain a portion of the power of every king or queen who wore it since.\nThe last monarch to wear the crown was King &lt;a href=\"Borgas\"&gt;Borgas&lt;/a&gt;, but it was believed lost when he was killed in the &lt;a href=\"Wild%20Hunt\"&gt;Wild Hunt&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"1E%20369\"&gt;1E 369&lt;/a&gt;. Legend holds that his body was secretly returned to Skyrim and buried with the crown, but the exact whereabouts were lost in the following &lt;a href=\"War%20of%20Succession\"&gt;War of Succession&lt;/a&gt;. During the Civil War questline, the Dragonborn can help recover the crown for either the &lt;a href=\"Imperial%20Legion%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Imperial Legion&lt;/a&gt; or the &lt;a href=\"Stormcloaks\"&gt;Stormcloaks&lt;/a&gt;, providing a great symbolic victory to the side in question.\nThe Crown of Verity.\nThe Crown of Verity was an alternative to the Jagged Crown created when the Jagged Crown was lost in the Wild Hunt of 1E 369. It infamously rejected &lt;a href=\"Asurn%20Ice-Breaker\"&gt;Asurn Ice-Breaker&lt;/a&gt; as High King in the fifth century of the First Era, cementing its authority deep into Skyrim's politics.\nHigh Rock.\nIn &lt;a href=\"High%20Rock\"&gt;High Rock&lt;/a&gt; there has only ever been one High King, &lt;a href=\"Emeric%20of%20Cumberland\"&gt;Emeric of Cumberland&lt;/a&gt;. A master warrior, brilliant politician, well-rounded in trading, speechcraft, and a brilliant strategist, he was also the King of &lt;a href=\"Wayrest\"&gt;Wayrest&lt;/a&gt;, High King of High Rock, the founder and Leader of the &lt;a href=\"Daggerfall%20Covenant\"&gt;Daggerfall Covenant&lt;/a&gt;, and the founder of the &lt;a href=\"Cumberland%20Dynasty\"&gt;Cumberland Dynasty&lt;/a&gt;.\nValenwood.\nHailing from Reaper\u2019s March, members of the Vinedusk Rangers specialize in using an assassin\u2019s techniques to keep the peace for the High King of Valenwood."}

His wife is &lt;a href=\"Queen%20Maraya\"&gt;Queen Maraya&lt;/a&gt;, daughter of &lt;a href=\"King%20Fahara%27jad\"&gt;King Fahara'jad&lt;/a&gt;. He mentions that he also has respect for both of the other alliances, the &lt;a href=\"Ebonheart%20Pact\"&gt;Ebonheart Pact&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Aldmeri%20Dominion%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Aldmeri Dominion&lt;/a&gt;.\nInteractions.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Supernal%20Dreamers\"&gt;Supernal Dreamers&lt;/a&gt;.\nDuring the &lt;a href=\"Alliance%20War\"&gt;Alliance War&lt;/a&gt;, Emeric received a visit from the &lt;a href=\"Vestige\"&gt;Vestige&lt;/a&gt; bearing a message from Abbot Durak of the Spirit Wardens from Pariah Abbey: the Dream Shard, which allowed the Wardens to create dreamless potions to shield Emeric from &lt;a href=\"Vaermina%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Vaermina&lt;/a&gt;'s Superal Dreamer Cult, had been stolen by the Midnight Union, who were under the influence of one of Vaermina's Omens. Emeric, and all of Stormhaven, were now at risk of influence while they slept. The High King sent the Vestige to recover the Dream Shard.\nAfter freeing Hosni at-Tura, leader of the Midnight Union, from the Omen's influence and returning the Shard to Pariah Abbey, Emeric then sent the Vestige to Shinji's Scarp in pursuit of another of Vaermina's Omens, who was suspected to be influencing the Orc General Godrun during his campaign against the Ironhand Ogres. The Vestige was able to aid the Orcs and crush the Ironhands, only to discover Godrun intended to lead his army against Wayrest to avenge the sacking of Orsinium. Abbot Durak sent the Vestige into the general's dream, where they defeated the Omen of Betrayal. However, Vaermina herself appeared before the Vestige and told them the general was merely a distraction: her consort, the Night Terror Galthis, had seized Emeric himself.\nAbbot Durak told the Vestige that they must consult Azura for guidance. Azura told the Vestige she would aid them against Vaermina, since she had desecrated Azura's shrine and attacked her Spirit Wardens. She also gave the Vestige a Dusk Stone, which would let the Vestige penetrate Emeric's nightmare, but they would be on their own against the Night Terror Galthis. The Vestige was able to enter the High King's nightmare and slay Galthis.\nEmeric thanked his savior, mentioning that they were more likely to regret helping him since it would likely mean more work helping the Covenant.\n&lt;a href=\"Baron%20Wylon%20Montclair\"&gt;Montclair's&lt;/a&gt; betrayal.\nThe High King then dispatched the Vestige to Shornhelm in Rivenspire. Baron Wylon Montclair, one of the three rulers Emeric had left to rule after Ranser's War, had turned against the other two, &lt;a href=\"Baron%20Alard%20Dorell\"&gt;Baron Alard Dorell&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Countess%20Eselde%20Tamrith\"&gt;Countess Eselde Tamrith&lt;/a&gt;. Montclair's forces had seized the northern half of Shornhelm fom Dorell and Tamrith and was making plans to seize the southern half. Emeric arrived in Shornhelm shortly after the Vestige and the Shornhelm guard drove Montclair's forces from the northern district of the city. The High King then asked the Vestige to go west to &lt;a href=\"Ravenwatch%20Castle\"&gt;Ravenwatch Castle&lt;/a&gt; to aid &lt;a href=\"Count%20Verandis%20Ravenwatch\"&gt;Count Verandis Ravenwatch&lt;/a&gt; in tracking down Reezal-Jul, one of Montclair's supporters and the one responsible for bringing Montclair forces into Shornhelm. Meanwhile, Emeric sent Baron Dorell east and Countess Tamrith west to root out Montclair's forces.\nAfter Montclair was defeated at the Doomcrag, Emeric recognized a sole ruler should govern Rivenspire, and offered the Vestige the choice of whom would rule, Baron Dorell or Countess Tamrith, as King or Queen of Shornhelm. After choosing, the High King asked the Vestige to speak to his wife Maraya, who sent the Vestige to the &lt;a href=\"Alik%27r%20Desert%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Alik'r Desert&lt;/a&gt; to aid her father King Fahara'jad.\nLiberation of &lt;a href=\"Bangkorai\"&gt;Bangkorai&lt;/a&gt;.\nAfter a two-pronged attack by Reachmen and &lt;a href=\"Imperial%20Legion%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Imperial&lt;/a&gt; forces, Emeric led a Covenant army into Bangkorai, where the Vestige had already thwarted the Reachmen's attempt to seize the city of &lt;a href=\"Evermore%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Evermore&lt;/a&gt;. However, the Imperial force under &lt;a href=\"Septima%20Tharn\"&gt;Septima Tharn&lt;/a&gt; had seized most of southern Bangkorai. Emeric led the Covenant army south to the &lt;a href=\"Bangkorai%20Garrison\"&gt;Bangkorai Garrison&lt;/a&gt;, where he led an assault on the main gate while the Vestige snuck in through a sewer gate and opened the main gate. The Imperials were routed, and in a last ditch effort opened a &lt;a href=\"Dark%20Anchor\"&gt;Dark Anchor&lt;/a&gt;, though the Vestige was able to close it.\nAs the High King moved south, he sent the Vestige to track down Septima Tharn at &lt;a href=\"Hallin%27s%20Stand\"&gt;Hallin's Stand&lt;/a&gt;. There they discovered Septima was holed up at the Hall of Heroes, rumored to contain a portal to &lt;a href=\"the%20Far%20Shores\"&gt;the Far Shores&lt;/a&gt;, the Redguard afterlife. Emeric led his force there, but before they could attack Septima captured Emeric and took him into the Hall. The Vestige fought their way through the Imperials and reached Septima at the portal to the Far Shores, where she stabbed Emeric, killing him, and took his soul with her through the portal.\nThe Vestige journeyed through in pursuit and found Septima commanding spirits of dead Redguards to fight for her. She sent wave after wave against the Vestige before facing them herself, but she was slain. &lt;a href=\"Tu%27whacca\"&gt;Tu'whacca&lt;/a&gt;, pleased the desecration of the Far Shores had been dealt with, allowed Emeric to return to life.\nMeeting at Stirk.\n&lt;a href=\"Vanus%20Galerion%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Vanus Galerion&lt;/a&gt; and the Vestige were able to convince all three alliance leaders to meet on the island of &lt;a href=\"Stirk\"&gt;Stirk&lt;/a&gt; of the coast of\u00a0&lt;a href=\"Cyrodiil%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Cyrodiil&lt;/a&gt;\u00a0to plan an invasion of\u00a0Coldharbour. Negotiations quickly broke down as the three leaders began arguing with each other. Vanus and &lt;a href=\"Countess%20Hakruba\"&gt;Countess Hakruba&lt;/a&gt; of the &lt;a href=\"Fighters%20Guild%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Fighters Guild&lt;/a&gt; realized the leaders would never agree to sending forces into Coldharbour for fear the others would use the opportunity to seize the\u00a0&lt;a href=\"Imperial%20City%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Imperial City&lt;/a&gt;. They asked the Vestige to convince the three leaders to allow the Fighters and &lt;a href=\"Mages%20Guild%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Mages Guild&lt;/a&gt; to go into Coldharbour instead. Before the negotiations could resume, &lt;a href=\"Molag%20Bal%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Molag Bal&lt;/a&gt; opened &lt;a href=\"Daedra%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Daedric&lt;/a&gt; portals on the island and his minions attacked. After being defeated, the three leaders realized the Guilds going in would be their best plan, and each gave their blessing.\nConversations.\nGeneral Godrun: \"The Daggerfall Covenant needs a stronger ruler, Emeric. Your reign as High King has come to an end. I'm taking Wayrest.\"\nHigh King Emeric: \"Damn it, Godrun. We've been friends for years \u2026! How can you just betray me like this?\"\nQueen Maraya: \"I rue the day my father gave you my hand in marriage. You're not worthy of being my husband, and you're certainly not worthy of being my king!\"\nHigh King Emeric: \"Maraya \u2026 I don't understand.

If I've lost your support, then I have lost everything.\"\nHigh King Emeric: \"If I might have everyone's attention.

Mark my words\u2014this victory will go down in the history books! This is the day the Empire began to crumble!\"\nQueen Arzhela: \"Knights of Saint Pelin! Many of your brothers and sisters died here, but this was the purchase of their sacrifice. Be grateful and be proud!\"\nHigh King Emeric: \"We have the bastards on the run now! Come Arzhela, come experience the joy of watching your enemies flee from battle.\"\nHigh King Emeric: \"All right everyone. This is it. No one is allowed to die until they've taken down at least a dozen enemies. Kill as many as you can. The only exception is the Magus-General\u2014she's mine, and mine alone.\"\nSeptima Tharn: \"Good speech, Emeric. I can't believe you still fancy me after all these years. Let's get reacquainted then, shall we?\"\nHigh King Emeric: \"Overconfident as ever, I see! I'm not afraid of you, Septima \u2026\"\nLion Guard: \"To arms! Defend the King!\"\nSeptima Tharn: \"You will not! I think we need some alone time, Emeric. Come, let's find a quiet place \u2026\"\nHigh King Emeric: \"You're here too? Can you get us back? It's quite pleasant here, but I'm not ready to die yet! We can't let them win!\"\nSeptima Tharn: \"Hush now, Emeric. Your death matters little\u2014there are other kings. It's this one I wanted. The one who's been holding the Covenant together at every turn. The vestige from Coldharbour. Didn't think I knew, did you? I did, and I knew I couldn't kill you \u2026 on Mundus. Here though, you're severed from Coldharbour, from your soul. Here, you're stuck. Goodbye now.\"\nKeeper of the Hall: \"Insolent necromancer! The Far Shores is no prison in which you can place your enemies! You dare to come here and then expect to leave freely? I think not. You though, are no less a fool. An honorable fool, but a fool nonetheless. Hm. Very well, though. I have an offer: slay this wretched woman and you and your liege can return to the Mundus.\"\nSeptima Tharn: \"I'll leave whenever I damn well please \u2026 but I'll enjoy teaching you both a lesson in power first.\"\nVanus Galerion: \"Esteemed High King Emeric, I thank you for agreeing to this meeting. I would not presume to waste your time without good reason.\"\nHigh King Emeric: \"We've known each other for some time, Master Galerion. You aren't known for your capricious whims. Tell me though\u2014who is your companion?\"\nVanus Galerion: \"Your Majesty, this is Skald-King Jorunn's personal representative, here to speak with you about the impending Coldharbour crisis.\"\nHigh King Emeric: \"The Skald-King sends his personal champion into his enemy's stronghold?

It wasn't a secret that Estre was bitter about losing the throne when Ayrenn returned, so Ayrenn, looking to smooth their relationship, elevated Estre to a high position in the &lt;a href=\"Thalmor%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Thalmor&lt;/a&gt; and made it a point to hold her final coronation ceremony in the city of Skywatch. She is also the hidden main antagonist in the &lt;a href=\"Auridon\"&gt;Auridon&lt;/a&gt; region.\nBackground.\nBehind the scenes, Estre is actually the Veiled Queen, the leader of the &lt;a href=\"Veiled%20Heritance\"&gt;Veiled Heritance&lt;/a&gt; and a secret worshipper of the &lt;a href=\"Daedric%20Prince\"&gt;Daedric Prince&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Mehrunes%20Dagon\"&gt;Mehrunes Dagon&lt;/a&gt;. As the Veiled Queen, she has used her influence to gain the support from many other minor canonreeves and other high-ranking members among the Altmer of &lt;a href=\"Auridon\"&gt;Auridon&lt;/a&gt;. Her goals are the dissolution of the &lt;a href=\"Aldmeri%20Dominion%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Aldmeri Dominion&lt;/a&gt; and expulsion of all non-Altmer from the &lt;a href=\"Summerset%20Isles%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Summerset Isles&lt;/a&gt;. In order to achieve this, she has ordered the &lt;a href=\"Veiled%20Heritance\"&gt;Veiled Heritance&lt;/a&gt; to use various methods; from assassinations, using magic to manipulate their ancestors, terrorism, even striking a deal with the &lt;a href=\"Maormer\"&gt;Maormer&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Ebonheart%20Pact\"&gt;Ebonheart Pact&lt;/a&gt;. She also allied herself with\u00a0&lt;a href=\"Mannimarco%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Mannimarco&lt;/a&gt;, who promised her the Summerset Isles to rule if she was compliant to both him and Molag Bal.\nInteractions.\nFortunately, she was exposed when the &lt;a href=\"Vestige\"&gt;Vestige&lt;/a&gt; infiltrated a &lt;a href=\"Veiled%20Heritance\"&gt;Veiled Heritance&lt;/a&gt; training camp just east of &lt;a href=\"Skywatch%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Skywatch&lt;/a&gt; and discovered her identity after confronting her three lieutenants. When Ayrenn was informed, she refused to believe that Estre was a traitor and declared that Estre knew of no magic, only to turn around to find her using magic to teleport out of Skywatch. She then begins to travel north through Auridon, leaving a path of &lt;a href=\"Daedra%20%28Online%29\"&gt;daedra&lt;/a&gt;, death and destruction in her wake.\nAt the village of &lt;a href=\"Dawnbreak\"&gt;Dawnbreak&lt;/a&gt;, she summons a host of daedra to invade an destroy the village as a sacrifice to her master Mehrunes Dagon. She surprises her friend and ally &lt;a href=\"Canonreeve%20Sinyon\"&gt;Canonreeve Sinyon&lt;/a&gt; and leaves him and his town to be wiped out by the daedra. She also released more daedra at one of the &lt;a href=\"Altmer\"&gt;Altmer&lt;/a&gt;'s holiest sites in Auridon, &lt;a href=\"Torinaan\"&gt;Torinaan&lt;/a&gt;, before finally arriving in &lt;a href=\"Firsthold%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Firsthold&lt;/a&gt; and opening up a number of portals to &lt;a href=\"Oblivion%20%28Realm%29\"&gt;Oblivion&lt;/a&gt;, taking &lt;a href=\"High%20Kinlord%20Rilis%20XIII\"&gt;High Kinlord Rilis XIII&lt;/a&gt; hostage.\nShe is killed when confronted by the Vestige, Battlereeve Urcelmo, Sinien and &lt;a href=\"Razum-dar%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Razum-dar&lt;/a&gt; in the Oblivion portal in Firsthold Keep.\nAfter her death she can be encountered in &lt;a href=\"Coldharbour%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Coldharbour&lt;/a&gt; at the &lt;a href=\"Cliffs%20of%20Failure\"&gt;Cliffs of Failure&lt;/a&gt;, participating in &lt;a href=\"the%20Observer\"&gt;the Observer&lt;/a&gt;'s \"Game.\"\n&lt;a href=\"The%20Witch%20of%20Silatar\"&gt;The Witch of Silatar&lt;/a&gt;.\nHigh Kinlady Estre appears in a vision taking place on &lt;a href=\"Silatar\"&gt;Silatar&lt;/a&gt;.\nDialogue.\nAfter finishing \"&lt;a href=\"A%20Hostile%20Situation\"&gt;A Hostile Situation&lt;/a&gt;\":\n\"Very impressive.

He is credited with discovering the &lt;a href=\"Summerset%20Isles\"&gt;Summerset Isles&lt;/a&gt; and founding the city of &lt;a href=\"Firsthold\"&gt;Firsthold&lt;/a&gt;.\nHistory.\nEarly life.\nTorinaan was born an Aldmer on the continent of &lt;a href=\"Aldmeris\"&gt;Aldmeris&lt;/a&gt;. When he grew older, he commandeered a fleet of ships towards lands which remained unknown.\nDiscovery and settlement of Alinor.\nTorinaan's ships arrived on a small cove located on the very northern tip of &lt;a href=\"Auridon\"&gt;Auridon&lt;/a&gt;, the second largest isle of the present-day province of Summerset Isles/Alinor. He named it \"&lt;a href=\"Nine-Prow%20Landing\"&gt;Nine-Prow Landing&lt;/a&gt;\" for the prows of his nine ships that made landfall within it.\nTorinaan then claimed the land, from its beaches to hills, as property of the Aldmer. He then named it \"Auridon,\" unsheathed blade and drew some of his blood, and swore an oath to never depart. With his sailors, began to settle the newly found land. They built houses, gardens, and forges, and founded the city of &lt;a href=\"Firsthold\"&gt;Firsthold&lt;/a&gt; on the island's northern tip. Torinaan was said to have kept a journal to document his discoveries, including the finding of the mysterious runestones spread upon the land.\nSettling the new land did not come without its risks and dangers, as creatures such as &lt;a href=\"Welwa\"&gt;Welwa&lt;/a&gt;, Gheatus, and Ilyadi sought to destroy the Aldmer. Feeling threatened and unsafe, the settlers suggested finding another safer land to settle upon. Torinaan, however, stood bold and fearless, and used the &lt;a href=\"Varla%20Stone\"&gt;Varla Stone&lt;/a&gt;s to draw upon the power of the &lt;a href=\"Magna%20Ge\"&gt;stars&lt;/a&gt;. With this power, Torinaan smote the creatures with the elements of fire, ice, and lightning. He then cast wards to protect the island from further attacks.\nAuridon bloomed under Torinaan's guidance, and many kinholds and settlements rose up in Summerset. Torinaan's achievements were looked up well upon by his kin.\nLegacy.\nTorinaan is revered for his courage, wisdom, foresight, and role in protecting the Aldmer settlers. The location of &lt;a href=\"Torinaan\"&gt;Torinaan&lt;/a&gt; was named in his honor, and still stood thousands of years later in &lt;a href=\"2E%20582\"&gt;2E 582&lt;/a&gt;. Ancirinque, Sapiarch of Mythohistory, had also studied passages from his journal. Records of Torinaan's founding of Firsthold were still present in &lt;a href=\"3E%20389\"&gt;3E 389&lt;/a&gt;."}

Should I call a healer?\"\nHigh Priestess Solgra: \"I am well enough, but innocent blood was spilled in the temple this day.\"\nForge-Mother Alga: \"I grieve for your fellow priests as much as you do, but changing the Orsimer way of life brings risks we are all well aware of.\"\nHigh Priestess Solgra: \"Trinimac's words \u2026 I came here to share them, not to bury my brothers and sisters in the faith.\"\nUpon finding the safe house:\nEveli Sharp-Arrow: \"We can't just walk into the Vosh Rakh base. That's suicide!\"\nHigh Priestess Solgra: \"We have to find out what the Vosh Rakh have planned. If we wait for them to strike, it will be too late.\"\nChief Bazrag: \"Whatever they're planning, it's going to happen soon. They just about told me as much when they threw me into my own prison!\"\nHigh Priestess Solgra: \"Maybe we should have left you in there. For all we know, you deserve to be in prison!\"\nChief Bazrag: \"Listen to me, Elf. I didn't attack anyone. I left Orsinium and they ambushed me.\"\nHigh Priestess Solgra: \"I sent you to rescue the chief, Eveli. I wouldn't have done that if I believed he was guilty.\"\nEveli Sharp-Arrow: \"You lied to us, high priestess! You knew who you were sending us to rescue the entire time! This feels like one giant trap and we walked right into it.\"\nHigh Priestess Solgra: \"Ah, you found us. I'm sorry that Eveli is upset, but I did what had to be done. Please, let's talk.\"\nAfter speaking with her:\nHigh Priestess Solgra: \"You two have your orders. Scout the temple exterior. The others will join you shortly.\"\nTalviah Aliaria: \"Finally! Something to do that doesn't involve a message!\"\nOutside the temple, if Eveli was sent to protect her:\nVosh Rakh Archer: \"There she is! Don't let the traitor get away!\"\nHigh Priestess Solgra: \"\"Tell the king I'll play no part in his political games.\nEveli Sharp-Arrow: \"I'm warning you. Back off or you'll feel the sting of my arrows!\"\nIn the temple, when Eveli is hurt:\nChief Bazrag: \"This wasn't suppose to happen. I should have never sent her here by herself.\"\nHigh Priestess Solgra: \"Eveli saved me. I plan to return the favor.\"\nChief Bazrag: \"Kurog won't get away with this, little one. We'll stop him.\"\nEveli Sharp-Arrow: \"Kick him in his tusks \u2026 for me \u2026.\"\nHigh Priestess Solgra: \"Rest now, Eveli. You need your sleep.\"\nChief Bazrag: \"I need to speak to you for a moment. This way.\"\nEveli Sharp-Arrow: \"I'd be honored, um, King Bazrag, your majesty.\"\nHigh Priestess Solgra: \"What a welcome surprise! Thank you, King Bazrag.\""}

{"id": "1469", "revid": "3256404", "url": "https://elderscrolls.fandom.com/wiki?curid=1469", "title": "High Rock", "text": "High Rock is the northwestern-most region of &lt;a href=\"Tamriel\"&gt;Tamriel&lt;/a&gt;. It is bordered by &lt;a href=\"Hammerfell\"&gt;Hammerfell&lt;/a&gt; to the southeast and &lt;a href=\"Skyrim\"&gt;Skyrim&lt;/a&gt; to the east. It is mainly populated by the &lt;a href=\"Bretons\"&gt;Bretons&lt;/a&gt; and is a province of the &lt;a href=\"Third%20Empire\"&gt;Tamrielic Empire&lt;/a&gt;. High Rock and the &lt;a href=\"Summerset%20Isles\"&gt;Summerset Isles&lt;/a&gt;\u00a0are the only &lt;a href=\"provinces\"&gt;provinces&lt;/a&gt; in Tamriel that do not share a land border with &lt;a href=\"Cyrodiil\"&gt;Cyrodiil&lt;/a&gt;.\nPeople.\nThe Bretons.\nThe Bretons are a race of &lt;a href=\"men\"&gt;men&lt;/a&gt; native to the province of High Rock. Bretons are the descendants of either an &lt;a href=\"Aldmeri\"&gt;Aldmeri&lt;/a&gt;-&lt;a href=\"Nedic\"&gt;Nedic&lt;/a&gt; or Aldmeri-&lt;a href=\"Atmoran\"&gt;Atmoran&lt;/a&gt; hybrid race of the &lt;a href=\"First%20Era\"&gt;First Era&lt;/a&gt; and are consequently termed as 'the mongrel race of Tamriel.' Their elven blood is heavily diluted, due to their ancestors intermingling with the Nordic population in Skyrim and High Rock. Bretons are sometimes called \"Manmeri\" as a result of the interbreeding, literally translating to 'man-elf.'\nAlthough their Aldmeri ancestry is shadowed by their appearance, they still inherit the magical affinity of their elven blood. Their physical features resemble their Nedic ancestors, including the obvious physical resemblance to &lt;a href=\"Imperials\"&gt;Imperials&lt;/a&gt;/&lt;a href=\"Nords\"&gt;Nords&lt;/a&gt;, but some still inherit the frail, sharp appearance of the elves, along with the arrogance, and some do have slight points in their ears.\nHistory.\nDawn Era.\nWith its fertile soils and weather that is often cloudy, yet relatively dry, High Rock has attracted many cultures throughout history. The &lt;a href=\"Aedra\"&gt;Aedra&lt;/a&gt; were the first of these. The &lt;a href=\"Adamantine%20Tower\"&gt;Adamantine Tower&lt;/a&gt;, on a small island in the middle of the &lt;a href=\"Iliac%20Bay\"&gt;Iliac Bay&lt;/a&gt;, is widely considered to be the oldest structure in Tamriel. According to ancient tales, it was crafted in the &lt;a href=\"Dawn%20Era\"&gt;Dawn Era&lt;/a&gt; by the Aedra as a location for meeting and deciding what would be the fate of &lt;a href=\"Nirn\"&gt;Nirn&lt;/a&gt;. Despite being heavily immersed in myth, it is true that when the first &lt;a href=\"Aldmer\"&gt;Aldmer&lt;/a&gt; came to the region, the Tower was already standing.\nMerethic Era.\nThere is evidence that early beast men of one variety or another may have been the original inhabitants of High Rock, but the Aldmer coming from the &lt;a href=\"Summerset%20Isles\"&gt;Summerset Isles&lt;/a&gt; were the first to settle and form permanent communities. The early Nedic people who arrived next were stumbling on a highly sophisticated culture and were quickly overwhelmed and absorbed. One of the earliest tales of Khosey describes a Nord raiding party attacking a group of what they presumed to be Altmer, but who were, on closer inspection, actually a mongrel race of elf-human ancestry, the last remnants of the lost Nedic tribe. They were somewhat awkwardly called Manmeri, but today they are known as Bretons.\nFirst Era.\nIt took many centuries for the Bretons to become the dominant force in High Rock. For most of the First Era, the elves kept their hold on the land, with the Nords founding fortified towns along the coasts to support their pillaging parties, such as Daggerfall, which as a kingdom would have a profound influence on High Rock in years to come.\nOf all the families of Aldmer who colonized High Rock, none did it as successfully as the &lt;a href=\"Clan%20Direnni\"&gt;Clan Direnni&lt;/a&gt;. So dominant were they that by the middle of the First Era, the whole of High Rock was commonly called the &lt;a href=\"Direnni%20Hegemony\"&gt;Direnni Hegemony&lt;/a&gt;. As an economic and military power, they were formidable enough to pose a continued threat to the battle-hardened Nords and the nascent &lt;a href=\"Alessian%20Empire\"&gt;Alessian Empire&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"Cyrodiil\"&gt;Cyrodiil&lt;/a&gt;. Taking advantage of internal strife in &lt;a href=\"Skyrim\"&gt;Skyrim&lt;/a&gt;, the Hegemony began taking land north and south of High Rock, claiming portions of Skyrim and Hammerfell. At the peak of their power, they controlled nearly a quarter of Tamriel. They had overextended their reach, and slowly, year by year, they lost all that they had gained, falling back to their fortress on the &lt;a href=\"Isle%20of%20Balfiera\"&gt;Isle of Balfiera&lt;/a&gt;, the Adamantine Tower, now called the Direnni Tower.\nThe Bretons were operating beneath the eyes of history, and their rise in High Rock was through commerce and the foundation of small villages in well chosen positions, such as the sleepy fishing hamlet of Wayrest on the coast between the Bjoulsae River and the Iliac Bay. Daggerfall, &lt;a href=\"Camlorn\"&gt;Camlorn&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Reich%20Gradkeep\"&gt;Reich Gradkeep&lt;/a&gt; and many other cities of Nordic origin became Breton not by any act of war, but simply by assimilation. By the end of the First Era, High Rock was the land of the Bretons, and would be so ever after.\nBut High Rock was never a single cohesive Breton nation. The power vacuum left by the Direnni decline fractured High Rock into a hundred fiefdoms of small, walled city-states. This has often left the Bretons at the mercy of the larger powers of Tamriel, but has also made High Rock surprisingly resilient during the times of chaos following the fall of the great empires.\nScarcely had the rule of the Dirennis passed into history before two new powers arrived in the region. The &lt;a href=\"Redguards\"&gt;Redguards&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"Yokuda\"&gt;Yokuda&lt;/a&gt; began their conquest of Hammerfell in &lt;a href=\"1E%20808\"&gt;1E 808&lt;/a&gt;, largely displacing beast folk in their attacks, but also supplanting Breton settlements along Iliac Bay's southern coast. The two cultures warred for dominance in the bay until they were faced with a common enemy in the form of the Orcish kingdom of &lt;a href=\"Orsinium\"&gt;Orsinium&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe rise, fall and rebirth of Orsinium is detailed in a larger section, but suffice it to say for now that the discovery of the \"monstrous\" kingdom of the creatures, as they were regarded, was a very unpleasant surprise to both Redguards and Bretons. An alliance between Daggerfall and the new kingdom of Sentinel led to the long war known as the Siege of Orsinium in &lt;a href=\"1E%20980\"&gt;1E 980&lt;/a&gt;. The humans eventually prevailed and Orsinium was destroyed. Afterwards, the Orcs dispersed far and wide across Tamriel.\nSecond Era.\nHigh Rock fared relatively well during the long interregnum following the fall of the &lt;a href=\"Second%20Empire\"&gt;Second Empire&lt;/a&gt;\u00a0in the &lt;a href=\"Second%20Era\"&gt;Second Era&lt;/a&gt;, but its multitude of fractious kingdoms were easily conquered by &lt;a href=\"Tiber%20Septim\"&gt;Tiber Septim&lt;/a&gt;. And there were many Bretons who welcomed the rebirth of the Empire with &lt;a href=\"Talos\"&gt;Talos&lt;/a&gt; sitting on the &lt;a href=\"Ruby%20Throne\"&gt;Ruby Throne&lt;/a&gt;.\nThird Era.\nSome of the Bretons managed to unite to stop the encroachment of the &lt;a href=\"Camoran%20Usurper\"&gt;Camoran Usurper&lt;/a&gt; in his destructive march northward from &lt;a href=\"Valenwood\"&gt;Valenwood&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"3E%20267\"&gt;3E 267&lt;/a&gt;. With a weak Emperor on the Imperial throne, and no clear leadership from the usual powers of the west, the Usurper may have swept over High Rock had the smallest of regions of the Iliac Bay not banded together under the Baron of Dwynnen to defeat him. Once again, an overwhelming force had underestimated the Bretons, and was in turn defeated.\nThe unity was lost when the threat was removed, and for the next one hundred and fifty years, internal and external conflicts continued. In the east, the Nords reclaimed some of their old kingdoms in the War of the Bend'r-Mahk. In the west, the War of Betony, though ostensibly between Daggerfall and &lt;a href=\"Sentinel\"&gt;Sentinel&lt;/a&gt;, spilled into Daggerfall's neighboring kingdoms. In the center, Orsinium reappeared as the home of the Orcs, threatening once again the fortunes of Wayrest. In &lt;a href=\"3E%20417\"&gt;3E 417&lt;/a&gt;, however, the province redefined itself in a most mysterious way.\nThey call the event the &lt;a href=\"Miracle%20of%20Peace\"&gt;Miracle of Peace&lt;/a&gt;. On the 10th of Frostfall in 3E 417, a strange force exploded over the Iliac Bay, displacing armies and decimating whole territories. Though its nature is still unknown, most Bretons believe it was the ancient Gods who had once made High Rock their home scouring the land, making it whole once again. Though it was a painful process for most\u2014the Miracle is sometimes spoken of as the &lt;a href=\"Warp%20in%20the%20West\"&gt;Warp in the West&lt;/a&gt;\u2014the result of it is a province that is more unified than it has ever been in modern history.\nFourth Era.\nWhere a hundred small kingdoms once squabbled over territory and resources, today, just two decades after the Miracle, there are just five left in High Rock.\nDaggerfall, the southernmost kingdom, enlarged greatly, conquering most of the southern peninsular regions up to &lt;a href=\"Anticlere\"&gt;Anticlere&lt;/a&gt; and\u00a0&lt;a href=\"Ykalon\"&gt;Ykalon&lt;/a&gt;. The crown of Daggerfall, through a series of marriages, is in union with the neighboring kingdoms of Camlorn to the north and Sentinel to the east, suggesting a future kingdom dominating both the Iliac Bay and the wider region.\nCamlorn, with its newfound allies to the south, have so far resisted the common skirmishes between that of Daggerfall and &lt;a href=\"Wayrest\"&gt;Wayrest&lt;/a&gt;, or that of &lt;a href=\"Northpoint\"&gt;Northpoint&lt;/a&gt;.\nOrsinium had at first prospered after the Warp in the West, and under the rule of &lt;a href=\"Gortwog%20gro-Nagorm\"&gt;Gortwog gro-Nagorm&lt;/a&gt; and with the aid of the &lt;a href=\"Numidium\"&gt;Numidium&lt;/a&gt;, it conquered a mass of territory in central High Rock from the &lt;a href=\"Wrothgarian%20Mountains\"&gt;Wrothgarian Mountains&lt;/a&gt; to the banks of the &lt;a href=\"Bjoulsae%20River\"&gt;Bjoulsae River&lt;/a&gt;. Despite this vigorous expansion, Gortwog had maintained good relations with his neighbors, allying himself with his former foe in\u00a0Wayrest\u00a0showing promise for a stable future. Furthermore, its application for elevation to Provincial status was under review by the Imperial authorities. The\u00a0&lt;a href=\"Elder%20Council\"&gt;Elder Council&lt;/a&gt;\u00a0treats Gortwog as a recognized king, and collects taxes directly from Orsinium, but officially Orsinium still remains a county of\u00a0High Rock, though technically spanning both the provinces of High Rock and Hammerfell. The only troubling sign for Orsinium at this time was a religious conflict that had brewed over time. However it was not this that would prove its eventual demise. As in the past, a united crusade from High Rock and Hammerfell would thwart the kingdom. The kingdom would persist in the &lt;a href=\"Dragontail%20Mountains\"&gt;Dragontail Mountains&lt;/a&gt;, however its campaign for provincial recognition is nothing more than a fantasy, especially due to &lt;a href=\"Stormcrown%20Interregnum\"&gt;regime changes&lt;/a&gt; in Cyrodiil among other &lt;a href=\"Great%20War\"&gt;pressing matters&lt;/a&gt;. Furthermore, much of its population would remain scattered, primarily as refugees seeking asylum in Skyrim and elsewhere, either in &lt;a href=\"Orsimer\"&gt;Orsimer&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Orc%20Strongholds\"&gt;tribal communities&lt;/a&gt; or within Imperial society.\nThe Northern Kingdoms of Northpoint and &lt;a href=\"Evermore\"&gt;Evermore&lt;/a&gt;, through a series of skirmishes would annex many petty kingdoms in its wake, absorbing much of northern High Rock, taking advantage of the Miracle of Peace and the resulting chaos. Its expansions, ambitious as they were, would fail to attract the attention of its neighbors, namely Daggerfall. However, Wayrest, Skyrim and indeed Daggerfall remain vigilant, eyes poised at their borders.\nWayrest would remain a dominant power in the West and would take full advantage of its alliance with the Orcs. Rivalries would still remain between Wayrest and the southern kingdoms, but skirmishes between them and the other minor powers never escalated to full blown war.\nHigh Rock would generally remain as a stable province of the Empire, and one of its richest.\nDuring &lt;a href=\"4E%20188\"&gt;4E 188&lt;/a&gt;, the city of Wayrest falls to corsairs at the &lt;a href=\"Invasion%20of%20Wayrest\"&gt;Invasion of Wayrest&lt;/a&gt;.\nGeography.\nHigh Rock encompasses &lt;a href=\"Greater%20Bretony\"&gt;Greater Bretony&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"Dellese%20Islands\"&gt;Dellese Islands&lt;/a&gt;, and, by tradition the &lt;a href=\"Western%20Reach\"&gt;Western Reach&lt;/a&gt;. Its regional geography is varied. The forested peaks of the northern Wrothgarian Mountains are occupied mainly by Orcish tribes based in &lt;a href=\"Orc%20Strongholds\"&gt;Orc Strongholds&lt;/a&gt;. The only truly cosmopolitan cities lie along the &lt;a href=\"Iliac%20Bay\"&gt;Iliac Bay&lt;/a&gt;, the enclosed body of water across from which sits &lt;a href=\"Hammerfell\"&gt;Hammerfell&lt;/a&gt;. A number of kingdoms have prospered due to trade around the bay and up the Bjoulsae River, such as &lt;a href=\"Wayrest\"&gt;Wayrest&lt;/a&gt;. Inland, the countryside rises into the windswept plateau of &lt;a href=\"North%20Kambria\"&gt;North Kambria&lt;/a&gt;. This region is known for its many small villages and towns and for grim fortifications that dot the hills and crags around them. In the past, these castles were the domains of many petty kings and lords that ruled the massive patchwork of small nations that used to make up High Rock. Many of these fortresses are now in ruins, as the &lt;a href=\"Empire\"&gt;Empire&lt;/a&gt; has been demolishing them since the time of &lt;a href=\"Tiber%20Septim\"&gt;Tiber Septim&lt;/a&gt; to prevent them from being used as bases for future rebellion. The islands of &lt;a href=\"Balfiera\"&gt;Balfiera&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Betony\"&gt;Betony&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Caecilly%20Island\"&gt;Caecilly&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Herne%20%28Island%29\"&gt;Herne&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Grayhome\"&gt;Grayhome&lt;/a&gt; are also considered part of the province.\nRegions.\nGlenumbra.\nGlenumbra is one of the five regions located in High Rock; it is also one of the three regions that make up Greater Bretony. Glenumbra is perhaps one of the larger ones since it consists of the large peninsula in the west that extends to the &lt;a href=\"King%27s%20Guard%20Mountains\"&gt;King's Guard Mountains&lt;/a&gt; that is between Shornhelm and Wayrest. The &lt;a href=\"Beldama%20Wyrd\"&gt;Beldama Wyrd&lt;/a&gt; live deep within the woods, worshipping the &lt;a href=\"Ehlnofey\"&gt;Ehlnofey&lt;/a&gt;. This region borders Stormhaven to the east and Rivenspire to the north. Many cities exist in this region including &lt;a href=\"Daggerfall\"&gt;Daggerfall&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Camlorn\"&gt;Camlorn&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Dwynnen\"&gt;Dwynnen&lt;/a&gt;. Glenumbra is divided into three smaller regions called &lt;a href=\"Daenia\"&gt;Daenia&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Cambray%20Hills\"&gt;Cambray Hills&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"King%27s%20Guard\"&gt;King's Guard&lt;/a&gt;.\nStormhaven.\nStormhaven is one of the five regions located in High Rock; it is also one of the three regions that make up Greater Bretony. Stormhaven is the center of Breton commerce in both High Rock and the Iliac Bay. It takes up the southern coast of High Rock in the Iliac Bay and the Bjoulsae River Estuary. The King's Guard Mountains and the Wrothgarian Mountains surround the region. Stormhaven borders all of the regions in High Rock. To the west is Glenumbra, to the east is Bangkorai, to the north is Wrothgar, and to the northwest is Rivenspire. The cities of &lt;a href=\"Wayrest\"&gt;Wayrest&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Alcaire\"&gt;Alcaire&lt;/a&gt; exist in the area. Stormhaven is divided into three smaller regions called &lt;a href=\"Alcaire\"&gt;Alcaire&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Menevia\"&gt;Menevia&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Gavaudon\"&gt;Gavaudon&lt;/a&gt;.\nRivenspire.\nRivenspire is one of the five regions located in High Rock; it is also one of the three regions that make up Greater Bretony. Rivenspire is where the Great Breton Houses of &lt;a href=\"House%20Tamrith\"&gt;Tamrith&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"House%20Dorell\"&gt;Dorell&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"House%20Montclair\"&gt;Montclair&lt;/a&gt; reside, and the three are a part of a political triangle in Rivenspire. The region takes up the northern area above Stormhaven, and it holds the legendary ruins known as the &lt;a href=\"Crypt%20of%20Hearts\"&gt;Crypt of Hearts&lt;/a&gt;. The &lt;a href=\"Battle%20of%20Markwasten%20Moor\"&gt;Battle of Markwasten Moor&lt;/a&gt; was held here. Rivenspire borders the regions of Glenumbra to the southwest, Stormhaven to the south, and Wrothgar to the southeast. The cities of &lt;a href=\"Shornhelm\"&gt;Shornhelm&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Northpoint\"&gt;Northpoint&lt;/a&gt; exist in the area. Rivenspire is divided into three smaller regions called &lt;a href=\"Eyebright%20Feld\"&gt;Eyebright Feld&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Westmark%20Moor\"&gt;Westmark Moor&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Boralis\"&gt;Boralis&lt;/a&gt;.\nBangkorai.\nBangkorai is one of the five regions located in High Rock; it is also one of the two regions that make up the Western Reach. Northern Bangkorai is a part of High Rock, and the entire region is divided by the &lt;a href=\"Bangkorai%20Pass\"&gt;Bangkorai Pass&lt;/a&gt;. Northern Bangkorai has many natural formations such as the &lt;a href=\"Viridian%20Woods\"&gt;Viridian Woods&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Halcyon%20Lake\"&gt;Halcyon Lake&lt;/a&gt;, and the Bjoulsae River that give it that distinct Reach vibe. The &lt;a href=\"Ayleid\"&gt;Ayleid&lt;/a&gt; city of &lt;a href=\"Bisnensel\"&gt;Bisnensel&lt;/a&gt; existed on the shores of Halcyon and the &lt;a href=\"Glenmoril%20Wyrd\"&gt;Glenmoril Wyrd&lt;/a&gt; has multiple covens located in the region. Bangkorai borders the regions of Stormhaven to the west and Wrothgar to the north. The city of &lt;a href=\"Evermore\"&gt;Evermore&lt;/a&gt; is located here. Bangkorai in its entirety is made up of three smaller regions called &lt;a href=\"Mournoth\"&gt;Mournoth&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Ephesus\"&gt;Ephesus&lt;/a&gt;, and the &lt;a href=\"Fallen%20Wastes\"&gt;Fallen Wastes&lt;/a&gt;.\nWrothgar.\nWrothgar is one of the five regions located in High Rock; it is also one of the two regions that make up the Western Reach. Wrothgar has been traditionally known as the home of &lt;a href=\"Orsimer\"&gt;Orsimer&lt;/a&gt;, a pariah group of warriors that live in isolated tribes across the &lt;a href=\"Druadach%20Mountains\"&gt;Druadach Mountains&lt;/a&gt;. Wrothgar has many ruins that date back from the &lt;a href=\"Dwemer\"&gt;Dwemer&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"Ayleid\"&gt;Ayleid&lt;/a&gt;s, the ancient &lt;a href=\"Nords\"&gt;Nords&lt;/a&gt;, and the ancient &lt;a href=\"Orcs\"&gt;Orcs&lt;/a&gt;. The first three incarnations of &lt;a href=\"Orsinium\"&gt;Orsinium&lt;/a&gt; have existed in these mountains, and the Bretons and Redguards besieged all three of them at one point or another. A prominent &lt;a href=\"Reachmen\"&gt;Reachmen&lt;/a&gt; tribe known as the &lt;a href=\"Winterborn%20Clan\"&gt;Winterborn Clan&lt;/a&gt; exist all throughout Wrothgar. The cities of Orsinium, &lt;a href=\"Fharun\"&gt;Fharun&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Jehanna\"&gt;Jehanna&lt;/a&gt; exist in the area. The region is divided into three smaller regions called &lt;a href=\"Western%20Wrothgar\"&gt;Western Wrothgar&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Central%20Wrothgar\"&gt;Central Wrothgar&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Eastern%20Wrothgar\"&gt;Eastern Wrothgar&lt;/a&gt;.\nReligion.\nThe main religion in High Rock is the Bretony Pantheon, where there are twelve divines:\nCulture.\nHigh Rock society can be divided into a noble elite, a middle class of merchants, and a destitute peasantry. The High Rock nobility is an overwhelming mass of titles, family lines, and hereditary claims that leave most outsiders bewildered at its complexity. Although the Bretons are divided into numerous antagonistic groups, their manner of speech, architecture, and even clothing seems fairly uniform to an outsider. A common anecdote suggests that an outsider only needs to visit one or two High Rock towns before he has an understanding of the entire country. Bretons have a strong tradition of being regarded as powerful mages, and this is especially true in the larger cities. In cities such as &lt;a href=\"Daggerfall\"&gt;Daggerfall&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Wayrest\"&gt;Wayrest&lt;/a&gt;, the nobility can trace its lines throughout the &lt;a href=\"Mages%20Guild\"&gt;Mages Guild&lt;/a&gt;, and children are tested at a young age for magical affinity. Magic is practiced by independent mages and medicine men in the more remote regions of the &lt;a href=\"Wrothgarian%20Mountains\"&gt;Wrothgarian Mountains&lt;/a&gt;."}

Each leads up into a small room which is generally occupied by the Jarl's daughter, &lt;a href=\"Idgrod%20the%20Younger\"&gt;Idgrod the Younger&lt;/a&gt;, in the room facing south, and Joric in the room facing north.

Once paying up, one can talk to him as to any non-hostile NPC. However, should they leave and return he will again demand gold.\nThe last option is to plead poverty if the Hero has less than 100 . If they wear clothing that is extremely poor in appearance or not wearing clothing at all, the highwayman will leave them alone.

I am sorry I have not written at more length or with more frequency, but trouble follows me like a cub chases its mother.\nIt is difficult for me to commit to words what I have experienced these many months away from you. Difficult, because each day my thoughts slip nearer to blasphemy.\nOur Glorious Emperor has taken us north into the place the barbarian peoples call the &lt;a href=\"Deathlands\"&gt;Deathlands&lt;/a&gt;. It is as inhospitable as the name suggests, unfit for any person to live in. But our Illustrious Emperor presses on, bent on the promise of a city of shimmering waters in the middle of the desert and mad dreams of an immortal army.\nSee? My pen betrays me. But what else can I call our Inscrutable Emperor's plan? A warrior's reward is eternal glory and rest for his weary body, but what of the warrior who is denied rest? What comfort is there for such a soldier?\nOur Resplendent Emperor would deny us death for his own glory. He would profane our bodies by having them rise again in unnatural forms to fight for him across the ages. Once again, my words form the foulest blasphemies.\nIn truth, I know that it is not our Marvelous Emperor who errs (I do not allow the possibility), but that foreigner who is by his side, always breathing corruptions into his ear. He stinks of ambition and his words cloy with false flattery.\nStill, this will be the last time I write to you dearest Anya. The error lies, ultimately, in myself. For though I am pledged to follow my master into death, I am unwilling to follow him after. When I am finished penning this letter, I will take the honorable course and die by my own sword.\nI beg you destroy this letter when you receive it, lest our &lt;a href=\"Celestial\"&gt;Celestial&lt;/a&gt; Emperor perceive that you share in my guilt.\nYours ever and always,\n&lt;a href=\"Targa\"&gt;Targa&lt;/a&gt;"}

The spikes on the shield inflict a wound\u2014when an enemy is bashed\u2014which bleeds for five seconds. The bleeding damage stacks if the target is bashed over and over. It is one of the weaker heavy shields in the game, being comparable to an &lt;a href=\"Iron%20Shield%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;iron shield&lt;/a&gt;, thus it seems to be intended for use as a secondary weapon while still providing some defense.\nLocation.\nThe Targe of the Blooded is carried by a hostile &lt;a href=\"Redguards%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Redguard&lt;/a&gt; named &lt;a href=\"Umana\"&gt;Umana&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;a href=\"Dwemer\"&gt;Dwemer&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Dwemer%20Ruins%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Ruin&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"Alftand\"&gt;Alftand&lt;/a&gt;. She is encountered at the end of Alftand, where she begins fighting with an &lt;a href=\"Imperials%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Imperial&lt;/a&gt; named &lt;a href=\"Sulla%20Trebatius\"&gt;Sulla Trebatius&lt;/a&gt; after some conversation with him. She will also attack the Dragonborn if the latter assaults either her or Sulla.\nSmithing.\nThe Targe of the Blooded can be upgraded at a &lt;a href=\"workbench\"&gt;workbench&lt;/a&gt; with a &lt;a href=\"Steel%20Ingot%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;steel ingot&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Arcane%20Blacksmith\"&gt;Arcane Blacksmith&lt;/a&gt; perk, though it does not benefit from any &lt;a href=\"Smithing%20%28Skyrim%29%23Perks\"&gt;Smithing perks&lt;/a&gt;. This means the shield cannot be improved past &lt;a href=\"Smithing%20%28Skyrim%29%23Improvement\"&gt;flawless&lt;/a&gt; quality without boosting the Smithing skill over 100. This can be achieved by using &lt;a href=\"Fortify%20Smithing%23Enchanting\"&gt;enchanted&lt;/a&gt; items and/or &lt;a href=\"Fortify%20Smithing%23Potions\"&gt;blacksmithing potions&lt;/a&gt; to &lt;a href=\"fortify%20Smithing\"&gt;fortify Smithing&lt;/a&gt;.\nEnchantment.\n&lt;a href=\"Block%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Bashing&lt;/a&gt; with this shield inflicts the following penalty on the target:\nIt cannot be disenchanted to learn its effects.\nUnlike the perk that causes bleeding damage that is inflicted by waraxes (which only effects enemies that can bleed), the Targe of the Blooded's effect also inflicts \"bleeding damage\" on enemies that do not bleed, such as &lt;a href=\"Draugr%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Draugr&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Vampire%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;vampires&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Dwarven%20Automatons\"&gt;Dwarven Automatons&lt;/a&gt;. This is somewhat similar to the &lt;a href=\"Ebony%20Mail%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Ebony Mail&lt;/a&gt;, which poisons enemies that cannot normally be poisoned, like the aforementioned examples. The damage from continuously bashing also stacks, and continues to work if the targeted enemy is in the \"bleedout\" state."}

He will attack no matter which option is chosen in the dialogue.\nIf the Dragonborn has no Aetherium items, Taron does not ask about them. However, if dialogue is engaged with him, he may be asked who he is and told that Katria had mentioned him. He will respond with, \"You know too much,\" fearing that the Dragonborn could reveal the truth and ruin him because of the Dragonborn's interaction with Katria, and attack the Dragonborn with three mercenaries he hired as his bodyguards.\nHe may also appear with his three mercenaries in the &lt;a href=\"Silver-Blood%20Inn\"&gt;Silver-Blood Inn&lt;/a&gt;. The same conversation as above is automatically initiated when the inn is entered. This fight can be quite easy as there are many people who the Dragonborn can befriend inside the inn, including &lt;a href=\"Cosnach\"&gt;Cosnach&lt;/a&gt;, who will help the Dragonborn against Taron and his three mercenaries.\nWhen Taron attacks, he prefers using &lt;a href=\"Fireball%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Fireball&lt;/a&gt; spells, and can reanimate his mercenaries as zombies with &lt;a href=\"Raise%20Zombie\"&gt;Raise Zombie&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"Reanimate%20Corpse\"&gt;Reanimate Corpse&lt;/a&gt;. Due to using Fireball, if engaged in the Silver-Blood Inn, the splash damage from the spell can kill the Markarth NPCs in the crossfire.\nDialogue.\n\"Your \"\"... gods, it's made of Aetherium!

The first is that division without unity is fatal.\"\n\"But how can there be both division and unity?\" Tazgol asked her.\n\"Naive question,\" the Wise Woman barked back. \"Don't the chief's three wives hate each other and yet love the chief, and so share the same desire? Is there not division when a young &lt;a href=\"Orsimer%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Orc&lt;/a&gt; challenges the chief and unity when the new chief is proclaimed triumphant? Just so, the three serpents were destroyed when they forgot that they were not three serpents but one serpent divided.\"\n\"But how do we maintain both division and unity?\" The young warrior wondered.\nThe Wise Woman chuckled: \"That is the second lesson of your vision: remember the past.\""}

Tear is the ancestral capital of the Great &lt;a href=\"House%20Dres\"&gt;House Dres&lt;/a&gt;, whose sphere of influence has involved agriculture and the hard-working spirit of the Dark Elves. They are known for practicing &lt;a href=\"Slavery\"&gt;Slavery&lt;/a&gt;.\nHistory.\n&lt;a href=\"First%20Era\"&gt;First Era&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Ruddy%20Man\"&gt;Ruddy Man&lt;/a&gt;, in legends, was the carapace of &lt;a href=\"Molag%20Bal\"&gt;Molag Bal&lt;/a&gt; in the previous &lt;a href=\"Kalpa\"&gt;Kalpa&lt;/a&gt;, one where the &lt;a href=\"Dreugh\"&gt;Dreugh&lt;/a&gt; were the dominant race. Those who don the carapace would become the Ruddy Man and would wreak havoc throughout the lands. The &lt;a href=\"Tribunal\"&gt;Tribunal&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Vivec\"&gt;Vivec&lt;/a&gt; fought against the Ruddy Man on the outskirts of &lt;a href=\"Gnisis\"&gt;Gnisis&lt;/a&gt;, in the isolated sea cave, &lt;a href=\"Koal%20Cave\"&gt;Koal Cave&lt;/a&gt;. Their battle resulted in the formation of the &lt;a href=\"West%20Gash\"&gt;West Gash&lt;/a&gt;, a large grazeland that cuts through Western &lt;a href=\"Vvardenfell\"&gt;Vvardenfell&lt;/a&gt; like a slash. The Ruddy Man's second known appearance was at the city-state of Tear, ten years later. It was worn by a shaman of the &lt;a href=\"House%20of%20Troubles\"&gt;House of Troubles&lt;/a&gt;, but instead of using it as armor, it fused with the shaman's body. Vivec had ultimately defeated the Ruddy Man by taking a giant form. He gave the remains to the mystics of the Number Room, and so the Ruddy Man has yet to appear since.\n&lt;a href=\"Second%20Era\"&gt;Second Era&lt;/a&gt;.\nIn &lt;a href=\"2E%20572\"&gt;2E 572&lt;/a&gt;, the Dark Elves of House Dres joined the &lt;a href=\"Ebonheart%20Pact\"&gt;Ebonheart Pact&lt;/a&gt;, an alliance consisting of Morrowind (except for &lt;a href=\"House%20Telvanni\"&gt;House Telvanni&lt;/a&gt;), &lt;a href=\"Black%20Marsh\"&gt;Black Marsh&lt;/a&gt; border regions, and &lt;a href=\"Eastern%20Skyrim\"&gt;Eastern Skyrim&lt;/a&gt;. House Dres had undergone a drastic change when slavery had become limited, to non-existent. The Dres were unable to practice slavery onto any race, considering that the &lt;a href=\"Argonians\"&gt;Argonians&lt;/a&gt; were now their allies. At one point, &lt;a href=\"Grandmaster%20Omin%20Dres\"&gt;Grandmaster Omin Dres&lt;/a&gt;, leader of House Dres had re-located into the city-state of &lt;a href=\"Kragenmoor\"&gt;Kragenmoor&lt;/a&gt;, which is traditionally the territory of &lt;a href=\"House%20Hlaalu\"&gt;House Hlaalu&lt;/a&gt;. Tear's expansive slave trade was dismantled for the time being. All the while, House Telvanni continues to practice slavery.\n&lt;a href=\"Third%20Era\"&gt;Third Era&lt;/a&gt;.\nDuring the &lt;a href=\"Imperial%20Simulacrum\"&gt;Imperial Simulacrum&lt;/a&gt; from &lt;a href=\"3E%20389\"&gt;3E 389&lt;/a&gt; to &lt;a href=\"3E%20399\"&gt;3E 399&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Emperor\"&gt;Emperor&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Uriel%20Septim%20VII\"&gt;Uriel Septim VII&lt;/a&gt; was imprisoned along with &lt;a href=\"Talin%20Warhaft\"&gt;Talin Warhaft&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;a href=\"Deadlands\"&gt;Deadlands&lt;/a&gt; by &lt;a href=\"Jagar%20Tharn\"&gt;Jagar Tharn&lt;/a&gt;. Tharn planned for months to capture the throne, and he was able to achieve so in ten years. Tharn had a powerful weapon called the &lt;a href=\"Staff%20of%20Chaos\"&gt;Staff of Chaos&lt;/a&gt;, and he split it into nine pieces and scattered them across Tamriel, the staff was the only thing keeping Uriel Septim and Warhaft in &lt;a href=\"Oblivion\"&gt;Oblivion&lt;/a&gt;. A warrior escaped his clutches and traveled all corners of Tamriel to retrieve the missing pieces. The hero was known as the &lt;a href=\"Eternal%20Champion\"&gt;Eternal Champion&lt;/a&gt;, and he assembled the staff and defeated Jagar Tharn at the &lt;a href=\"Imperial%20Palace\"&gt;Imperial Palace&lt;/a&gt;. The Eternal Champion had at one point visited the city of Tear in their quest to recover the pieces. The city of Tear was under the rule of &lt;a href=\"King%20Nisath\"&gt;King Nisath&lt;/a&gt;.\n&lt;a href=\"Fourth%20Era\"&gt;Fourth Era&lt;/a&gt;.\nWhen &lt;a href=\"Red%20Mountain\"&gt;Red Mountain&lt;/a&gt; erupted in &lt;a href=\"4E%205\"&gt;4E 5&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"Red%20Year\"&gt;Red Year&lt;/a&gt;, the inner mainland of Morrowind was largely unaffected, but the coast around Tear was affected. An earthquake had occurred after the initial eruption, and the dam was cracking, causing water to seep into the plantations. Many farmers were attempting to save their livestock and family, until the southern wall of Tear had collapsed, ensnaring many people in the destruction. Once everything had settled, the people of Tear, poor or rich were helping each other, from the crumbled buildings and walls. Since Tear is built on a marsh, the surrounding water was slowly swallowing the city, and the unstable ground caused the walls to crumble. Tear was vulnerable, even with the upcoming &lt;a href=\"Accession%20War\"&gt;Accession War&lt;/a&gt;."}

She was considered the envy of all the &lt;a href=\"Ayleid\"&gt;Ayleid&lt;/a&gt; nobility for her beauty, grace, and wisdom were unsurpassed.\nIn time, she was married to the prince of a distant by great city. It was to be an alliance that spread across &lt;a href=\"Tamriel\"&gt;Tamriel&lt;/a&gt;. The prince was renowned for his martial prowess and stubborn honor, but he loved his new bride Anurraame dearly.\nFor a time, they were happy, or, at least, they seemed so. But as the years wiled away, Anurraame's husband was away more and more, and duty proved a poor substitute for passion.\nSo it came to pass that Anurraame took a young champion of Erokii for a lover. Strong and gleaming with youthful light and energy, Anurraame's lover gave her what the old, distant prince could not\u2014the thrill of infatuation and friendship.\nAnuraame was careful at first to keep her affair a secret, lest she shame her husband. But caught up in passion's capricious winds, she became more and more reckless, and soon her dalliance was discovered.\nSpurned and infuriated, Anurraame's husband arrayed his full army before Erokii and laid siege to the city. The princess vowed to face him with fortitude and called on her lover to muster his forces in defense of the city, which he promised he would.\nBut when the day of battle came, her lover's forces appeared beside her husband's. His undying passion had been subverted by coin.\nDesperate and enraged at her lover's betrayal, Anurraame called on the &lt;a href=\"Daedra\"&gt;Daedra&lt;/a&gt; for help destroying her enemies and defending her city. &lt;a href=\"Mephala\"&gt;Mephala&lt;/a&gt; answered and commanded Anuraame to pour all her tears into a basin. Mephala then imbued the tears with the power of the princess' hatred for her traitorous lover, hatred which had formed from the potent seed of the princess's love.\nThe tears, so empowered, hardened into an artifact, the &lt;a href=\"Tear%20of%20Anurraame\"&gt;Tear of Anurraame&lt;/a&gt;. When the time of battle came, Anurraame took the artifact to the highest tower of the city and as the armies raged outside the city's walls, she unleashed its power, destroying the armies and the city in the flash of an eye.\nAll that remains of Erokii, and of Anurraame, is a ruined crypt, but there have been whispers throughout the ages that the Tear was not destroyed, and that it's waiting in the rubble, still to be found."}

A &lt;a href=\"Khajiit%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;Khajiit&lt;/a&gt; named &lt;a href=\"S%27drassa\"&gt;S'drassa&lt;/a&gt; asks the &lt;a href=\"Hero%20of%20Kvatch\"&gt;Hero of Kvatch&lt;/a&gt; to find &lt;a href=\"Garridan%27s%20Tear\"&gt;Garridan's Tear&lt;/a&gt;s. S'drassa enjoys collecting crystals, especially those of a &lt;a href=\"magic\"&gt;magic&lt;/a&gt;al nature, and is willing to pay a handsome amount of &lt;a href=\"Septim%20%28Coin%29\"&gt;gold&lt;/a&gt; for each Tear recovered.\nBackground.\nS'drassa describes a bit about Garridan's Tears. Apparently, they're literally tears of a &lt;a href=\"Knight%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;knight&lt;/a&gt; named Garridan who was killed and frozen while battling a &lt;a href=\"Frost%20Atronach%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;Frost Atronach&lt;/a&gt; ages ago. To find where they may be located, he suggests speaking to &lt;a href=\"Julienne%20Fanis\"&gt;Julienne Fanis&lt;/a&gt; at &lt;a href=\"Arcane%20University%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;Arcane University&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;a href=\"Imperial%20City%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;Imperial City&lt;/a&gt;.\nWalkthrough.\nImperial City.\nAfter talking to S'drassa about Garridian's Tears, go to the Arcane University in the Imperial City and ask Julienne Fanis about the Tears. She refers the Hero to a book, &lt;a href=\"Knightfall\"&gt;Knightfall&lt;/a&gt;, available at the &lt;a href=\"First%20Edition%20%28Location%29\"&gt;First Edition&lt;/a&gt; bookstore in the &lt;a href=\"Market%20District\"&gt;Market District&lt;/a&gt;, if they want to learn more about possible locations of &lt;a href=\"Garridan%27s%20Tear\"&gt;Garridan's Tear&lt;/a&gt;s.\nGo to the First Edition bookstore in the Market District and buy Knightfall from &lt;a href=\"Phintias\"&gt;Phintias&lt;/a&gt;, then read the book.\nKnightfall tells the tale of &lt;a href=\"Garridan\"&gt;Garridan&lt;/a&gt; and the quest for Everflow Ewer at a place known as &lt;a href=\"Frostfire%20Glade\"&gt;Frostfire Glade&lt;/a&gt;. It is supposedly located in the mountains near &lt;a href=\"Bruma%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;Bruma&lt;/a&gt;. The book also mentions needing special &lt;a href=\"Refined%20Frost%20Salts\"&gt;Refined Frost Salts&lt;/a&gt; to get into the Glade, which can be bought from Julienne Fanis.\nIf the Hero talks to S'drassa again, he will give them five &lt;a href=\"Philter%20of%20Frostward\"&gt;Philter of Frostward&lt;/a&gt; potions that will protect against &lt;a href=\"Frost%20Damage%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;frost damage&lt;/a&gt;.\nOut to Frostfire Cave.\nHead to Frostfire Cave and fight through. It's mostly occupied by &lt;a href=\"Rat%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;rat&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"Wolf%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;wolves&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Mountain%20Lion%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;mountain lions&lt;/a&gt;, and/or &lt;a href=\"Bear%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;bears&lt;/a&gt;. Once finding the door to the actual Frostfire Glade, enter. &lt;a href=\"Frost%20Atronach%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;Frost Atronach&lt;/a&gt;s will be encountered within the glade.\nThe entire area seems filled with a swirling, freezing mist. The extreme cold in this place is unbearable without magical protection. The glade is true to its namesake: the frost burns as if it was fire.\nIn the center of Frostfire Glade, the Hero will discover an astonishing sight: Garridan himself locked in an eternal frozen struggle with a huge Frost Atronach. The journal entry reads as follows --\n\"It appears that Garridan had dropped his weapon and was using the Ewer to protect himself. The Atronach smashed the Ewer, which must have reacted with the magical waters and froze everything solid. A sad end for such a noble knight.\"\nRetrieving Garridan's Tears.\nSearch the ground surrounding Garridan for Garridan's Tears; there are five of them. Four will be scattered on the ground around the frozen warrior. A fifth tear is up on top of the rock hosting the ice sculpture, on the opposite side from the tree-bridge.\nBe careful, as they are extremely tiny and hard to find. If the Hero happens to hit one of the Tears with their foot while walking, it could get bumped under a rock or plant, making it nearly impossible to find. Occasionally, the Hero may accidentally hit one of the tears and it will get stuck in the ice, making it impossible to complete the quest without console commands. Walk slowly when searching for the Tears. The Tears are easier to spot when on one of the surrounding rocks.\nOnce they have recovered the five Tears, return to S'drassa for a reward of &lt;a href=\"Septim%20%28Coin%29\"&gt;gold&lt;/a&gt;."}

Since then, &lt;a href=\"Rurelion\"&gt;Rurelion&lt;/a&gt;\u2014a powerful &lt;a href=\"Aldmeri%20Dominion%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Dominion&lt;/a&gt; mage\u2014has gone missing inside the temple, and his apprentice, &lt;a href=\"Gathwen\"&gt;Gathwen&lt;/a&gt;, is looking for someone to help her find him.\nBackground.\n\"A powerful mage named Rurelion went missing in the Temple of the Mourning Springs. I agreed to help his apprentice Gathwen search the temple for signs of her master.\"\nAfter an expedition into the temple to acquire the Mourning Stone, Ealcil, Gathwen, and Rurelion are separated. The former two escape safely, but Rurelion is unable to make it past the skeletons in time, left trapped inside. &lt;a href=\"Razum-dar%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Razum-dar&lt;/a&gt; hears talk about the incident from Ealcil, and sends the Vestige to investigate during \"&lt;a href=\"Storm%20on%20the%20Horizon\"&gt;Storm on the Horizon&lt;/a&gt;.\"\nDetailed walkthrough.\nGathwen approaches the Vestige from outside the temple, pleading for help:\n\"Please, I need your help. My master's life is in danger!\"\nThe quest begins when the Vestige agrees. The quest marker will point to the front gate of the temple.\nTemple Entrance.\nWhen approaching the entrance, a skeleton stands in the way, preventing entry. When spoken to, it tells them both to leave:\n\"Turn back. You aren't welcome here.\"\nRurelion is trapped inside the temple, under the spirit that also controls the skeleton; after it is done talking, it breaks apart. Gathwen reinforces that the wards sealing the temple doorway need to be taken down.\nTemple Courtyard.\nThe temple courtyard is guarded by numerous &lt;a href=\"Skeleton%20%28Online%29\"&gt;skeletons&lt;/a&gt;, including &lt;a href=\"Skeletal%20Warrior%20%28Online%29\"&gt;warriors&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Skeletal%20Archer%20%28Creature%29\"&gt;archers&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Skeletal%20Cryomancer\"&gt;cryomancers&lt;/a&gt;. They respawn quite fast, and are a random variation each time\u2014meaning that if extra experience is desired, one must be ready to combat any of the types when a new skeleton appears. Unlike most enemies, however, they will be dormant, and can be sneaked around easier due to them not walking around.\nThe two wards can be found at opposite ends of the courtyard, marked with either a spider or a scorpion. After walking up the stairs to each, a voice will speak; depending on the symbol, this will be one of two lines:\nUnseen Voice: \"Scorpion's poison courses through its prey ...\"\nUnseen Voice: \"Spider weaves the web around its prey ...\"\nGathwen will take them down once they have been activated; be wary of the second ward, for a more powerful &lt;a href=\"Undead%20%28Online%29\"&gt;undead&lt;/a&gt;\u2014a &lt;a href=\"Revenant%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Revenant&lt;/a&gt;\u2014will be there to defend it.\nOnce both wards are deactivated, the Vestige and Gathwen enter the catacombs.\nTemple Catecombs.\nInside the catacombs lies another sealed door, which can only be accessed after a combination puzzle is completed. Gathwen will give a hint about it: \nGathwen: \"Hmm ... the cycle of the two moons seems to be the key to dispersing the barrier.\"\nThe four pillars to the left and right of the barrier all have pictures of the two moons on them, and should be done in succession of how they would appear at consequent points in their cycle: first, activate the farthest one to the left, the New Moons Stone, with &lt;a href=\"Masser\"&gt;Masser&lt;/a&gt; on top. Next, hit the second farthest to the right, the Waxing Moons Stone; then, the farthest right, which is the Full Moon Stone; and finally, the second farthest to the left, which is the Waning Moon Stone, with the smaller moon\u2014&lt;a href=\"Secunda\"&gt;Secunda&lt;/a&gt;\u2014on top. The correct order can also be found on a wall in the room, shown to the right.\nThis will open the barrier, but before entering the next room, Gathwen will stop you, asking to speak first.\n\"When we entered the temple, that skeleton made it sound as though Rurelion was in grave danger. I won't let vague threats keep us from my master, but Rurelion is too important to lose. Perhaps we should think before we act.\"\nCentral Ruins.\nRurelion can be seen in the center of the room, looking alive and well. Approaching him, however, will reveal that he is Uldor, a powerful &lt;a href=\"Maormer\"&gt;Maormer&lt;/a&gt; Wizard, who had been permanently imprisoned in the temple:\n\"Ears that large and you still don't listen? Perhaps you need a few alterations. There was a time when the sound of Uldor's voice commanded the terror of thousands.\"\nWhen the Vestige tells Uldor to stand down, he begins the ritual, summoning skeletons to take over the island. Gathwen will comment:\nGathwen: \"\"Leave Rurelion for now. We have to disrupt the summoning ritual! I'll destroy the bone piles if you keep the undead at bay. It'll take a moment to weaken the circle. Keep the undead away from me!\" \nFour bone piles sit around Uldor; simply going near one of them will let Gathwen begin her spell, which will take a few seconds to complete for each pile. The undead in this room, however, are far less powerful than the ones in the courtyard. Although killing all of the undead is not essential to dispelling the ritual, it is ill-advised to leave the skeletons roaming, for even though they are weak, it is easy to get surrounded.\nEventually, Gathwen will send the Vestige to help Rurelion, saying that she will be right behind them. With the plan thwarted, Uldor will anger, blasting the Vestige to the ground, but before anything else, Rurelion will begin to fight off Uldor's control:\nUldor: \"\"Stay back!\" \nRurelion: \"\"Uldor! Get out of my body, now!\" \nUldor: \"\"Silence! None command Uldor!\" \nUldor runs off as he struggles to suppress Rurelion. Gathwen will be exhausted from the battle, and stays back for a bit to recuperate. The Vestige enters the Great Hall alone.\nGreat Hall.\nThe Great Hall will contain four &lt;a href=\"Giant%20Bat%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Giant Bats&lt;/a&gt;, who will attack the Vestige when they get close enough. In addition, the hall is also littered with spike traps, which must be walked or jumped over at the right time in order to avoid losing health. As &lt;a href=\"Rurelion%27s%20Observation%20No.%203\"&gt;Rurelion's Observation No. 3&lt;/a&gt; hints, one must be quick to make it through the room, or else both the traps and the bats will inflict damage.\nOnce at the end of the hall, Uldor and Rurelion's fight can be seen coming to a conclusion:\nRurelion: \"\"Uldor, I command you! By the Tears of the Two Moons, return to your prison!\" \nUldor: \"\"Ahh! That won't hold me for long!\" \nAfter yelling in pain, Rurelion will regain control of his body. He will tell the Vestige to deactivate the traps. The lever to turn off the traps can be found just up the stairwell behind Rurelion; once this is done, Rurelion will initiate dialogue as Gathwen enters.\nDecision.\nRurelion will explain that Uldor is only restrained for the moment, and must be imprisoned once again:\n\"Despite all my knowledge, Uldor's influence over me was absolute. I'd be little more than a puppet without your timely intervention.\"\nRurelion hands the Vestige fours stones to place in Uldor's tomb while the Altmer mage distracts him. Immediately after proposing this, Gathwen protests.\nShe'll want to talk to the Vestige. Her opinion can be immediately agreed with, or Rurelion can be spoken to again.\n\"Rurelion's plan is to let Uldor possess him! They'll both be sealed in the tomb, forever. But it doesn't need to be this way. Seal me inside.\" \nNow, the Vestige must make a decision on who must remain inside the tomb. Both Gathwen or Rurelion can be talked to, although they have the option of getting Rurelion's opinion beforehand:\n\"We should hurry. Uldor won't be trapped for long.\"\nThey can also return to Gathwen:\n\"Nothing you say will convince me. I'm sealing myself in that tomb.\"\nThe person chosen will be the one to enter Uldor's tomb to distract him and will be trapped, while the other will remain on the outside. Regardless of who's selected, an argument will take place. If Gathwen is chosen:\nRurelion: \"\"Gathwen, I beg you to reconsider.\" \nGathwen \"You're too important, Rurelion. If the Dominion lost you, we could be lost.\" \nRurelion: \"\"Then I will recover the Mourning Stone! Farewell, my dearest friend.\" \nGathwen: \"Farewell, Rurelion.\"\nIf Rurelion is chosen:\nGathwen: \"\"You can't do this, master!\" \nRurelion: \"\"The Dominion will thrive without me. It's far stronger than it knows. \nGathwen: \"\"Then I should recover the Mourning Stone. Farewell, Rurelion. I ...\" \nRurelion: \"\"I know Gathwen ... I know. Give me a moment to collect myself. I'll be right behind you.\" \nUldor's Tomb.\nInside the tomb, Uldor, in spectral form, will be waiting near his original body. Whoever is chosen to be claimed by him will approach from the front, offering themself without a fight as a distraction. If that person was Rurelion, the following exchange occurs: \nRurelion: \"\"I've reconsidered what our combined power can do, Uldor. I willingly give myself over.\" \nUldor: \"\"I knew such power would tempt you. Very well.\" \nRurelion: \"\"Hurry! Place the Tears of the Two Moons in the pedestals!\" \nUldor: \"\"Wretched fool! I'll turn your friend to ash!\" \nIf it was Gathwen, this is what occurs instead:\nGathwen: \"\"Uldor, my master was a fool to doubt your power. I'll help you wreak the vengeance you seek, if you allow me.\" \nUldor: \"\"Such a spectacular, willing garment! Very well.\" \nGathwen: \"\"I can't fight him for long! Quickly, place the Tears of the Two Moons in the pedestals!\" \nUldor: \"\"Wretched fool! I'll turn your friend to ash!\" \nEither way, Uldor takes control of the person brought forward, and the Vestige must place the four Tears of the Two Moons on the pedestals in each corner of the room. Uldor will protest as the Vestige progresses, sending bolts of lightning at them, which are damaging to any stationary player. Avoid the areas which turn red, for they will be struck by Uldor's magic; having higher stamina makes the process easier due to the fact that this final battle relies on running rather than combat.\nOnce the stones have been placed, Rurelion or Gathwen will possess his or her body again for a short time, and so the Vestige says a final goodbye before leaving. For Rurelion:\n\"Go, quickly. I feel Uldor's weakness fade. Hurry, tell Gathwen of the plan's success. But don't mourn for me, friend. I earned a useful fate. Few can say the same.\"\nFor Gathwen:\n\"The water weakens Uldor, but I can't hold him for long. Quickly, go to Rurelion. Tell him I did what must be done.\"\nThe character sent to retrieve the Mourning Stone will be in the Great Hall again. If that is Gathwen, then this exchange occurs: \n\"It's done, isn't it? Rurelion is sealed inside with that monster.\"\nIf that is Rurelion, then this happens:\n\"We've restored the Mourning Stone. But if you're here, then Gathwen is lost to that monster.\"\nRurelion or Gathwen will give the Vestige a leveled amount of gold, as well as the &lt;a href=\"Mourning%20Bow\"&gt;Mourning Bow&lt;/a&gt; as a final reward. They will open up a portal to the courtyard, which the Vestige can use if desired as the quest completes.\nRewards.\nRegardless of who is chosen to be sacrificed, the rewards are the same:"}

They see the ball and the court and say all kinds of funny things. Today the &lt;a href=\"Altmer%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Tall-Elf&lt;/a&gt; I travel with pointed to the court and asked, \"This is a garden, yes?\" I didn't know how to respond, so I just blinked at him. What kind of garden grows no food? Tall-Elves can be very stupid. Still, I think I should write down the rules so people ask me fewer questions.\nTeeba-hatsei means something like \"hip and tail ball\" in the dry tongue. All of us play it\u2014some better than others. I was never very good. My arms are too long and my tail is too thin. The best teeba-players are short and bulky with broad tails like alligators and hips that swing like bags of cinnamon-grass.\nThe game is played on a broad field of dry mud and salt-meadow hay. On either end of the field is a wall of mud and eeto cane. The size of the field and the height of the wall vary from village to village. In Xiniss for example, the wall is twenty hands tall. Two reed hoops are suspended over the field. One is about thirty hands high. The other is about fifty. Again, this varies. For example, the Tum-Taleel tend to set their hoops lower as they are fat and stupid and cannot jump very high.\nEach team consists of five players. The game begins by tossing the ball (or teeba) skyward. Each team tries to hit the ball with their hips, elbows, or tails. This can hurt a bit since the teeba is very heavy and made of depasa gum. Some players wear pads of wood and dried wasso leaves to protect themselves, but most &lt;a href=\"Argonians%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Saxhleel&lt;/a&gt; make fun of them for doing so.\nThe teeba is volleyed back and forth between the teams, with each player trying to strike the opposing wall with the ball. If they succeed, their team earns a point. Teamwork is very important. One player may tap the teeba upward so a second player can swat it with their tail. Tail-strikes tend to be much stronger. This continues until one of the teams has scored ten points.\nTeams can earn three points by hitting the ball through the lower reed hoop. This is very difficult to do though, since the hole is so small. If a player is able to get the ball through the upper hoop, the game is over and whichever team has the highest score at that time is declared the winner.\nThere is, of course, much more to it. But this primer should at least keep the scaleless ones from trying to pitch their tents in the middle of the court."}

For Teegla, the closest location is the &lt;a href=\"Telvanni%20Canalworks\"&gt;Telvanni Canalworks&lt;/a&gt;.

This strategy may be applied to other areas, by bringing such slaves to nearby locations from which slave keys have already been obtained, and retained in the inventory."}

He and his twin\u00a0sister, Ocheeva, were born with the Shadow as a birthsign and subsequently were enrolled in the ranks of the Shadowscale. He and his sister adapted quickly to the ways of the assassin.\nThey served the Royal Court of Argonia with honor and dignity and always completed their missions. During their time in Argonia, they befriended a fellow Shadowscale, Scar-Tail. Once they came of a certain age, they were transferred to the Dark Brotherhood.\nLife within the Brotherhood.\nIn the Brotherhood, Teinaava advanced quickly through the ranks, though not as quick as his sister, Ocheeva, until he reached the rank of Assassin. About the time he reached Assassin, a new family member was brought to the Sanctuary, and was quick to befriend the &lt;a href=\"Hero%20of%20Kvatch\"&gt;new assassin&lt;/a&gt;.\nAs time went by, he completed more missions, one involving killing a man and his escort of six &lt;a href=\"Imperial%20Legion\"&gt;Imperial Legion&lt;/a&gt; soldiers. As the Hero progressed, Teinaava gave them the task of killing the traitor, Scar-Tail, and for the Hero to bring him Scar-Tail's heart. Teinaava and all the other members of the Sanctuary were sent to the &lt;a href=\"void\"&gt;void&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"Sithis\"&gt;Sithis&lt;/a&gt;\u00a0by the Hero during \"&lt;a href=\"The%20Purification\"&gt;The Purification&lt;/a&gt;.\"\nFate.\nTeinaava was killed by\u00a0the Hero\u00a0alongside the rest of the members of the\u00a0Cheydinhal Sanctuary\u00a0during \"The Purification.\" It was believed that one of its members had become a risk but it was unclear who. However, &lt;a href=\"Mathieu%20Bellamont\"&gt;the traitor&lt;/a&gt;\u00a0was not killed and somehow was overlooked as one of the possible risks.\nPersonality and traits.\nTeinaava was quite young when he was murdered during \"The Purification.\" He had orange eyes like most Argonians and green and red scales. He was warm, friendly, and always helpful to his fellow family members. He was fully devoted to the Dark Brotherhood and &lt;a href=\"Lucien%20Lachance%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;Lucien Lachance&lt;/a&gt;, who was like a father to him.\nInteractions.\nLike other members in the\u00a0Dark Brotherhood Sanctuary, he will give the\u00a0Hero\u00a0advice or ridicule them when asked about the current contract, depending on his\u00a0disposition.\n&lt;a href=\"The%20Renegade%20Shadowscale\"&gt;The Renegade Shadowscale&lt;/a&gt;.\nTeinaava will ask for the Hero's assistance to fulfill another duty outside of the Dark Brotherhood's affairs, to help him get rid of traitor Shadowscale, Scar-Tail.\n&lt;a href=\"The%20Purification\"&gt;The Purification&lt;/a&gt;.\nTeinaava is one of the members of the\u00a0Cheydinhal\u00a0Sanctuary who must be killed during this quest."}

The town itself surrounds a Telvanni tower that shares the same name. The town is built around the Tel Aruhn Tower, and several smaller towers were created next to Tel Aruhn. Down the hill from the village are the local docks, where the entrance to Tel Aruhn is located.\nHistory.\n&lt;a href=\"Merethic%20Era\"&gt;Merethic Era&lt;/a&gt;.\nTel Aruhn, along with multiple other settlements such as &lt;a href=\"Tel%20Mora\"&gt;Tel Mora&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Ald%20Redaynia\"&gt;Ald Redaynia&lt;/a&gt;, were founded by &lt;a href=\"Aldmer\"&gt;Aldmer&lt;/a&gt;i explorers from the &lt;a href=\"Summerset%20Isles\"&gt;Summerset Isles&lt;/a&gt; during their expedition to Vvardenfell. Their plan was to chart the region from Azura's Coast to the Isles of &lt;a href=\"Sheogorad\"&gt;Sheogorad&lt;/a&gt;. Later in the same era, the Prophet &lt;a href=\"Veloth\"&gt;Veloth&lt;/a&gt; traveled across &lt;a href=\"Tamriel\"&gt;Tamriel&lt;/a&gt; to the area now known as &lt;a href=\"Morrowind\"&gt;Morrowind&lt;/a&gt;. Tel Aruhn along with various other settlements such as &lt;a href=\"Narsis\"&gt;Narsis&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Vos\"&gt;Vos&lt;/a&gt; was populated by the &lt;a href=\"Chimer\"&gt;Velothi people&lt;/a&gt;.\n&lt;a href=\"First%20Era\"&gt;First Era&lt;/a&gt;.\nIn &lt;a href=\"1E%202920\"&gt;1E 2920&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"Four%20Score%20War\"&gt;Four Score War&lt;/a&gt; ravaged the Morrowind-&lt;a href=\"Cyrodiil\"&gt;Cyrodiil&lt;/a&gt; countryside and ended with an agreement in the fortress city of &lt;a href=\"Ald%20Marak\"&gt;Ald Marak&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href=\"Juilek%20Cyrodiil\"&gt;Juilek Cyrodiil&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Vivec\"&gt;Lord Vivec&lt;/a&gt; agreed to give the &lt;a href=\"Second%20Empire\"&gt;Second Empire&lt;/a&gt; several settlements across the Eastern Morrowind coast and border cities as well. These locations included Tel Aruhn, &lt;a href=\"Ald%20Lambasi\"&gt;Ald Lambasi&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Tel%20Mothrivra\"&gt;Tel Mothrivra&lt;/a&gt; among other places. In return, no attacks from the Empire would come upon Morrowind, under no circumstances. This did not last long since Juilek would later be assassinated and his father, &lt;a href=\"Reman%20Cyrodiil%20III\"&gt;Reman Cyrodiil III&lt;/a&gt;, would also be murdered by the &lt;a href=\"Morag%20Tong\"&gt;Morag Tong&lt;/a&gt;.\n&lt;a href=\"Second%20Era\"&gt;Second Era&lt;/a&gt;.\nDuring the &lt;a href=\"Interregnum\"&gt;Interregnum&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"2E%20583\"&gt;2E 583&lt;/a&gt;, the town of Tel Aruhn was ruled by &lt;a href=\"Gothren\"&gt;Archmagister Gothren&lt;/a&gt;, the leader of House Telvanni in Vvardenfell. Around the same time, an &lt;a href=\"Argonian\"&gt;Argonian&lt;/a&gt; slave named &lt;a href=\"Sun-in-Shadow\"&gt;Sun-in-Shadow&lt;/a&gt; was freed and proceeded into the ranks of House Telvanni with the help of an Outlander called the &lt;a href=\"Vestige\"&gt;Vestige&lt;/a&gt;. She requested an audience with Gothren himself, so she and the Vestige traveled to Tel Aruhn to speak with him. Gothren greatly opposed the idea of having an Argonian in House Telvanni, so he forcefully makes her slave again. Through serious consideration, Gothren accepted her into House Telvanni, and she became a member of House Telvanni.\n&lt;a href=\"Third%20Era\"&gt;Third Era&lt;/a&gt;.\nIn &lt;a href=\"3E%20427\"&gt;3E 427&lt;/a&gt;, the town of Tel Aruhn continued to be ruled by Gothren and House Telvanni. During the same year, the &lt;a href=\"Nerevarine%20Prophecy\"&gt;Nerevarine Prophecy&lt;/a&gt; came to fruition, and the &lt;a href=\"Nerevarine\"&gt;Nerevarine&lt;/a&gt; roamed the region to unite the people of &lt;a href=\"Morrowind\"&gt;Morrowind&lt;/a&gt; to fight against the &lt;a href=\"Tribunal\"&gt;Tribunal&lt;/a&gt;. The Nerevarine needed to convince the high-ranked members of House Telvanni to make them the Telvanni &lt;a href=\"Hortator\"&gt;Hortator&lt;/a&gt;. Gothren was not persuaded that the Nerevarine was, in fact, the Nerevarine and was unwilling to be convinced otherwise. The Nerevarine was forced to assassinate Gothren, to ensure their position of Hortator. It was a grave cause need to end a bigger problem.\n&lt;a href=\"Fourth%20Era\"&gt;Fourth Era&lt;/a&gt;.\nIn &lt;a href=\"4E%205\"&gt;4E 5&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Red%20Mountain\"&gt;Red Mountain&lt;/a&gt;, which is located in the center of Vvardenfell, had erupted after years of remaining dormant throughout Dunmeri history. The resulting explosion caused the destruction of virtually all of Vvardenfell's settlements such as &lt;a href=\"Sadrith%20Mora\"&gt;Sadrith Mora&lt;/a&gt;, Tel Aruhn, and &lt;a href=\"Gnisis\"&gt;Gnisis&lt;/a&gt;. Very little life remained in the now endless sea of ash formerly known as Vvardenfell. A &lt;a href=\"House%20Redoran\"&gt;House Redoran&lt;/a&gt; Councilman from &lt;a href=\"Mournhold\"&gt;Mournhold&lt;/a&gt; issued a relief effort to rebuild the cities of Vvardenfell from the ground up. As of &lt;a href=\"4E%20201\"&gt;4E 201&lt;/a&gt;, it is unknown whether the effort reached Tel Aruhn and the town was rebuilt."}

It is the furthest one from Sadrith Mora, the Telvanni capital of Vvardenfell. The town, like other Telvanni towers, are built around a central mushroom tower. Branora is isolated from the rest of Vvardenfell, with the closest town being the fortress of &lt;a href=\"Molag%20Mar\"&gt;Molag Mar&lt;/a&gt; to the north and the city of &lt;a href=\"Vivec%20City\"&gt;Vivec&lt;/a&gt; to the west. Branora's primary source of income is through fishing since Tel Branora Isle is deep within the &lt;a href=\"Inner%20Sea\"&gt;Inner Sea&lt;/a&gt;. There is no way to travel to Tel Branora other than by boat from Vivec City, Molag Mar, or even far away &lt;a href=\"Tel%20Aruhn\"&gt;Tel Aruhn&lt;/a&gt;. West of Tel Branora is the &lt;a href=\"Zaintiraris\"&gt;Zaintiraris&lt;/a&gt; peninsula, which houses several creatures including &lt;a href=\"Hunger\"&gt;Hunger&lt;/a&gt;s and &lt;a href=\"Bull%20Netch\"&gt;Bull Netch&lt;/a&gt;es. Across the Inner Sea is the region of &lt;a href=\"Bal%20Foyen\"&gt;Bal Foyen&lt;/a&gt; on the mainland.\nHistory.\n&lt;a href=\"Second%20Era\"&gt;Second Era&lt;/a&gt;.\nDuring the &lt;a href=\"Interregnum\"&gt;Interregnum&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"2E%20583\"&gt;2E 583&lt;/a&gt;, the village of Tel Branora was under the administration of &lt;a href=\"Therana\"&gt;Mistress Therana&lt;/a&gt;, who was a part of the Telvanni Council on Vvardenfell. Around the same year, an &lt;a href=\"Argonian\"&gt;Argonian&lt;/a&gt; slave girl was freed from her binds and rose through the ranks of House Telvanni to the Oathmen rank. Mistress Therana was the one that gave the slave girl, &lt;a href=\"Sun-in-Shadow\"&gt;Sun-in-Shadow&lt;/a&gt; her first writ to free her from slavery; she would eventually become a Retainer after the council meeting.\n&lt;a href=\"Third%20Era\"&gt;Third Era&lt;/a&gt;.\nIn &lt;a href=\"3E%20427\"&gt;3E 427&lt;/a&gt;, the town of Tel Branora continued to be ruled by Therana and House Telvanni. During the same year, the &lt;a href=\"Nerevarine%20Prophecy\"&gt;Nerevarine Prophecy&lt;/a&gt; came to fruition, and the &lt;a href=\"Nerevarine\"&gt;Nerevarine&lt;/a&gt; roamed the region to unite the people of &lt;a href=\"Morrowind\"&gt;Morrowind&lt;/a&gt; to fight against the &lt;a href=\"Tribunal\"&gt;Tribunal&lt;/a&gt;. The Nerevarine needed to convince the high-ranked members of House Telvanni to make them the Telvanni &lt;a href=\"Hortator\"&gt;Hortator&lt;/a&gt;. Through serious consideration, Mistress Therana was convinced and gave the Nerevarine her blessing for the title of Telvanni Hortator.\n&lt;a href=\"Fourth%20Era\"&gt;Fourth Era&lt;/a&gt;.\nIn &lt;a href=\"4E%205\"&gt;4E 5&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Red%20Mountain\"&gt;Red Mountain&lt;/a&gt;, which is located in the center of Vvardenfell, had erupted after years of remaining dormant throughout Dunmeri history. The resulting explosion destroyed virtually all of Vvardenfell's settlements including &lt;a href=\"Balmora\"&gt;Balmora&lt;/a&gt;, Sadrith Mora, &lt;a href=\"Vivec%20City\"&gt;Vivec City&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Ald%27ruhn\"&gt;Ald'ruhn&lt;/a&gt;. Very little life remained in the now endless sea of ash formerly known as Vvardenfell. A &lt;a href=\"House%20Redoran\"&gt;House Redoran&lt;/a&gt; Councilman from &lt;a href=\"Mournhold\"&gt;Mournhold&lt;/a&gt; issued a relief effort to rebuild the cities of Vvardenfell from the ground up. As of &lt;a href=\"4E%20201\"&gt;4E 201&lt;/a&gt;, it is unknown whether the effort reached Tel Branora and the city was rebuilt."}

Because all Telvanni towers used levitation magic to scale their heights, a different approach was required for Tel Mithryn. Neloth dealt with this problem by creating a magical device at the base of the tower stem. A small circular pad embedded with glowing runes acts as an elevator, channeling arcane energy from the runed plateau vertically through the hollowed out mushroom stem to a pronged focal point near the top of the tower, which is connected to the roof. This allows anyone to travel from the ground floor to the top of the tower in a mere matter of seconds, and vice-versa.\nThe main floor of the tower is littered with arcane items, including various magical\u00a0&lt;a href=\"Artifacts%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;artifacts&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Potions%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;potions&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Alchemy%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;alchemical&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Ingredients%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;ingredients&lt;/a&gt;,\u00a0&lt;a href=\"Spell%20Tomes%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;spell tomes&lt;/a&gt;\u00a0and other\u00a0&lt;a href=\"Books%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;books&lt;/a&gt;\u00a0about magic (all of which belong to Neloth, so taking them is &lt;a href=\"stealing\"&gt;stealing&lt;/a&gt;). There are also tables covered with various &lt;a href=\"Dwemer%20artifact\"&gt;Dwemer artifact&lt;/a&gt;s\u00a0and tomes about the Dwemer. Three smaller additional rooms are on the north, east, and south sides of the main room. These include a bedroom, a creature testing lab containing two caged &lt;a href=\"Spriggan%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Spriggans&lt;/a&gt; (regular and &lt;a href=\"Burnt%20Spriggan\"&gt;burnt&lt;/a&gt;), and an &lt;a href=\"Enchanting%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;enchanting&lt;/a&gt; room, which also includes a\u00a0&lt;a href=\"Staff%20Enchanter\"&gt;Staff Enchanter&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe lab with the two caged Spriggans only appears after completing the quest \"&lt;a href=\"Healing%20a%20House\"&gt;Healing a House&lt;/a&gt;.\" \nThe enchanting room is locked and can only be accessed after completing the quest \"&lt;a href=\"Reluctant%20Steward\"&gt;Reluctant Steward&lt;/a&gt;.\""}

He was sent to &lt;a href=\"Skingrad%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;Skingrad&lt;/a&gt; to purloin a rare book, \"&lt;a href=\"Lost%20Histories%20of%20Tamriel\"&gt;Lost Histories of Tamriel&lt;/a&gt;\", from the wizard in the castle there. She wants the Hero to bring the book back; apparently the &lt;a href=\"The%20Gray%20Fox%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;Gray Fox&lt;/a&gt; is very interested in it.\nWalkthrough.\nEnter the jail.\nAfter speaking to S'Krivva, head for Skingrad and track down one of the local beggars to find out what's been happening. With the usual application of coinage, the Hero learns that Theranis was last seen being dragged off to the castle dungeons, the result of bragging about stealing something from the castle and foolish enough, he did this in the &lt;a href=\"Two%20Sisters%20Lodge\"&gt;Two Sisters Lodge&lt;/a&gt; where the Captain of the &lt;a href=\"Skingrad%20Guard\"&gt;Skingrad Guard&lt;/a&gt; was drinking at the time. To talk to Theranis, the Hero is going to have to get into the dungeons somehow. There are several ways to enter the prison dungeon.\nMethod one.\nFollow the marker to the town gate, leave and climb the hill up to the castle. Make way down to the dungeons and talk to the jailer. Bribery doesn't work on him, unfortunately, but he does mention that &lt;a href=\"Shum%20gro-Yarug\"&gt;Shum gro-Yarug&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Janus%20Hassildor\"&gt;the Count's&lt;/a&gt; butler, is looking to hire people to work at the castle. Follow the marker to track him down.\nHandily, Shum gro-Yarug is looking for somebody to deal with the prisoners. The pay's lousy and he failed to find anyone for the job, so he requires absolutely no persuasion to let the Hero do it. He tells them to feed the prisoners once a day (he doesn't care when) and that the guards will open the door when asked. Head back down to the dungeon, where the guard will open the door.\nMethod two.\nSimply sneak into the prison dungeon with a ranged &lt;a href=\"Open%20Hard%20Lock\"&gt;Open Hard Lock&lt;/a&gt; spell, or pickpocket the jailor for the key.\nMethod three.\nBypass the prison completely and sneak through &lt;a href=\"Castle%20Skingrad\"&gt;Castle Skingrad&lt;/a&gt;'s rooms and into the Wine Cellar, then follow the blood stains on the ground.\nMethod four.\nOne may speak to &lt;a href=\"Larthjar%20the%20Laggard\"&gt;Larthjar the Laggard&lt;/a&gt; in a double cell of the castle prison. Gaining entrance is as simple as committing a minor but jailable offense. Moreover, while serving the sentence, the Hero can gain knowledge of the work that Shum gro-Yarug is offering from one of the passing guards.\nMethod five.\nTell the guard the Hero wish to see the prisoners, and he will follow them in. Once inside tell him again about seeing the prisoners and he will retreat back to his post by the door.\nLarthjar the Laggard.\nOnce inside the cell area, the Hero's marker will point to a prisoner by the name of Larthjar the Laggard. Talking to him reveals that Theranis was held in one of the other cells with an &lt;a href=\"Argonians%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;Argonian&lt;/a&gt; prisoner, but that an individual called the &lt;a href=\"Pale%20Lady\"&gt;Pale Lady&lt;/a&gt; took him some time ago. She takes people on a regular basis, it seems, and nobody ever returns after their third time. This was the third time she'd taken Theranis. Larthjar also notes that the Argonian was taken only an hour ago, struggling and bleeding quite badly.\nAt the far end of the cell block, there is a decidedly door-shaped mark on the end wall. On the wall to the right, there's a candle holder. Use it and the secret door will swing open, revealing a passageway carved into the rocks with what suspiciously looks like fresh bloodstains on the floor. Follow the passageway, through a door into an area near the Castle Skingrad Wine Cellar, until the end of the passageway and another secret door. Turn the handle on the wall to open it.\nContinue to follow the bloodstains on the floor down into the wine cellar, where the stains seem to end in front of a large wine barrel. Another secret door is behind the center barrel. To open it, activate the unlit candle holder that's on the back side of the right pole.\nFollow the passageway to find the Pale Lady waiting. She is a &lt;a href=\"Vampire%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;vampire&lt;/a&gt; and clearly lacking any social politeness and she attacks on sight. She uses an &lt;a href=\"invisibility%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;invisibility&lt;/a&gt; spell to give the Hero a few problems, however a hero with a high stealth skills or items can sneak up on the Pale Lady and hit her for critical damage.\nOnce she is dealt with there's time to notice Theranis' body lying on the ground. The Argonian prisoner is still alive in a nearby cell. Talk to him and it turns out to be &lt;a href=\"Amusei\"&gt;Amusei&lt;/a&gt; again, back in captivity. Unsurprisingly, he's rather grateful to the Hero and relates that Theranis gave him a message about a treasure to be taken back to the &lt;a href=\"Thieves%20Guild%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;Thieves Guild&lt;/a&gt;. Get him out of the castle and Amusei will reveal this message. The key to the cell along with a general castle key, can be found on the Pale Lady's body. Note: It may be necessary to reverse pickpocket Amusei, giving him the Skingrad Castle Key to prevent an issue with him being unable to follow through doors. Saving before pickpocketing is recommended.\nEscaping the castle.\nEscaping the castle is a bit tough because once the Hero and Amusei are discovered by the guards they will know both are escaping prisoners and the castle guards will act accordingly. Let Amusei out and head back out through the wine cellar. Turn right and go through into the dining area. Go through the dining area itself and take the right door in the small alcove through into the County Hall. They'll end up in a passage off to one side of the hall rather than the hall itself. Note: The hero may have to wait for an hour for Amusei to catch up if he fails to follow through the door. \nOpposite is a door out into the courtyard. Head out through the gate and off along the causeway leading to the castle. Follow the marker until a message appear that they've successfully escaped. Amusei will then pass on Theranis' message.\nRetrieving and returning the book.\nTheranis has hidden the book, \"&lt;a href=\"Lost%20Histories%20of%20Tamriel\"&gt;Lost Histories of Tamriel&lt;/a&gt;\", under a bush near a well behind &lt;a href=\"Nerastarel%27s%20House\"&gt;Nerastarel's House&lt;/a&gt; in Skingrad. Following the marker leads the Hero right to it.\nGet back to Bravil and give the book to S'Krivva. She'll be sad about Theranis' death but she will be pleased about the book, telling the Hero that the Gray Fox has been looking for it for many years. She then gives them their reward of 400 ."}

On the island's platform can be found the &lt;a href=\"Two-Handed%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Two-Handed&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Skill%20Books%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;skill book&lt;/a&gt;, \"&lt;a href=\"Words%20and%20Philosophy\"&gt;Words and Philosophy&lt;/a&gt;\". Also, behind the southern most waterfall, there is a hidden semi-underwater tunnel that leads to a loot chest and another iron ore vein (on the west wall after emerging from the water). Continuing on the main path, there is a short zig-zag incline. At the top, to the west southwest, there is a wooden pathway that leads to an area with a chest with leveled loot. The main path ultimately leads to the tunnel entrance to the next area of the cave.\n&lt;a href=\"Lost%20Knife%20Hideout\"&gt;Lost Knife Hideout&lt;/a&gt;.\nOnce inside, a conversation can be overheard between several bandits sitting around the corner in a small tavern-like space. Once they have been dispatched, across a bridge-like structure is the place where the leader of the bandits is being held. When on the bridge, to the right on the ground there is a &lt;a href=\"Corundum%20Ore%20Vein\"&gt;corundum ore vein&lt;/a&gt; to be mined and a chest right next to it.\nThey have locked him up for the time being, and one suggests that someone let the cat loose to shut him up. Once the bandits have been dispatched, the Dragonborn can continue up towards the living quarters where the &lt;a href=\"Heavy%20Armor%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Heavy Armor&lt;/a&gt; skill book, \"&lt;a href=\"How%20Orsinium%20Passed%20to%20the%20Orcs\"&gt;Orsinium and the Orcs&lt;/a&gt;\", is on a table by the beds.\nHeading across the rickety bridge will lead to what appears to be an arena. The leader of the bandit group can be seen locked up in the middle surrounded by dead bandits and beasts. There is a &lt;a href=\"Sabre%20Cat%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;sabre cat&lt;/a&gt; locked up in the cage that can be released to assist in the mayhem. The cat has a tendency to escape the cage even without it having been opened by the player, especially after all the bandits are dead. If this happens, it will often not attack but rather walk calmly around the cave until attacked. Behind the cat's cage is a small tunnel with a master-locked chest hidden inside. There is also a corundum ore vein nearby. Upon exiting there is a &lt;a href=\"Gold%20Ore%20Vein\"&gt;gold ore vein&lt;/a&gt; in the last room before leaving. The back door of the arena returns to the main lake area.\nTrivia.\nBandit 1 \"So, you're saying you brought that cat down alone?\"\"\nBandit 2 \"Why? You don't think I could do it?\"\"\nBandit 1 \"Wasn't our last catch a Cave Bear?\"\"\nBandit 2 \"Yeah, why?\"\"\nBandit 1 \"Take down that one with your bare hands, too?\"\"\nBandit 2 \"Troll's blood was he a tough one!\"\"\nBandit 1 \"Pfft.\"\"\nBandit 2 \"But I've got the key to the Saber Cage. Look!\"\"\nBandit 1 \"What's that supposed to prove? Get back on patrol!\"\"\nAnd the second at the bar area:\nBandit 1 \"Looks the boss is at it again.\"\"\nBandit 2 \"Why? What's he doing now?\"\"\nBandit 1 \"He's on one of his drunk rants again. Except this time he's challenging everyone to a duel over in the hole. We've got him locked in there now, but he's still challenging anyone who looks crooked at him.\"\"\nBandit 2 \"Someone should let that cat . That'd shut him up real quick.\"\"\nBandit 1 \"Hey, don't say that too loud, you don't want it getting back to him.\"\""}

He offered to hire me as protection while we explored the crypt, and asked me to meet him there if I was interested.\"\nWalkthrough.\nUpon completion of \"&lt;a href=\"A%20New%20Source%20of%20Stalhrim\"&gt;A New Source of Stalhrim&lt;/a&gt;,\" a historian by the name of Tharstan in the Skaal Village will ask the Dragonborn to help him explore a tomb.\n\"I heard from Deor how you went in search of Baldor. That was very brave, and in fact, that's just the kind of courage I'm looking for.\"\nLet me guess, you need me to do something dangerous. \"Quite right! Quite right! This, however, is paying work. Allow me to explain.\"\nI helped a man in need, that's all. \"Modest as well as brave. Most admirable! I can see why the Skaal think highly of you. Yes I think you're just the adventurous sort I need. I have a job offer for you.\"\nAfter the conversation is over, the quest will begin and Tharstan will head off to Vahlok's Tomb.\nVahlok's Tomb.\nThe entrance is sunken in a rift in the ground that runs north from the tomb itself. Enter the tomb and talk to Tharstan. He will mention: \"Remarkable, isn't it? This tomb has been hidden for... well, who knows how long. Many centuries, I would think.\"\nDown a short pathway is an etched tablet overlooking a trapdoor fire pit. Below the tablet is a handle. To the left and right are paths that lead to other sections of the tomb. Tharstan remarks:\n\"\"I've had a look around and the only interesting thing I've found is this inscription here, and a switch below it. Now, I'm not sure if you can read the dragon language, but this seems to be a riddle of some sort. \"A sacrifice will bring you closer to that which you seek.\" I wonder what it means.\"\"\nThe puzzle can be solved by dragging the corpse of a nearby draugr onto the trapdoor and pulling the handle located under the tablet to provide a sacrifice. This will open two routes off of the platform, marked by torches.\nRetrieving the first key.\nCrossing the left (south) bridge leads to tunnels deeper into the ruin. The tunnel turns left (east), then leads to an iron door. Beyond the door is a crypt heading off to the right (south) containing several draugr. The path turns left (east), then left again, and leads to an iron gate. Pulling the chain will open the gate to the next room. Through this door will be a glowing monolith, with a bow, a sword, and a staff on the floor at the bottom of the three different faces of the monolith. Tharstan remarks:\n\"\"Hm... three pillars. Other than that plaque, there doesn't seem to be anything else worthy of note. Lets see what the inscription says. \"All men must die, often by their own means.\" Sounds rather grim, if you ask me. The inscription must be a reference to these pillars. Three pillars surrounding a central one. Perhaps they are connected somehow. They also have glowing stones of some kind at the top. They look vaguely similar to drawings I've seen of objects called Impact Stones. Well, see what you can figure out. I'm going to inspect these pillars further to see if I've missed something.\" \nIn order to unlock the north door of the room, the pillars opposite each of the faces of the central monolith must be struck with the weapons that were found on the floor and correspond to the symbol shown on the corresponding face of the monolith \u2013 i.e. sword strike for sword side, etc. Once all three glowing stones are activated, the gate in the north wall to the next room will open.\nInside the room, various draugr burst out of coffins. Among them, there is a &lt;a href=\"Draugr%20Deathlord%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;draugr deathlord&lt;/a&gt; that holds the &lt;a href=\"Amethyst%20Claw%2C%20Left%20Half\"&gt;Amethyst Claw, Left Half&lt;/a&gt;. A &lt;a href=\"Word%20Walls%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Word Wall&lt;/a&gt; is in the back of the room, providing the first word of the shout &lt;a href=\"Battle%20Fury\"&gt;Battle Fury&lt;/a&gt;. Two chests are in front of the wall to the right and left. Tharstan remarks:\n\"Let's have a closer look at these runes. These runes have faded a bit, but I believe I can translate the inscription. The writing describes a guardian who defeated someone named Miraak. In fact, if I'm reading this correctly, it says that Miraak was a traitor. Most interesting.\"\nA well-lit but small opening to the left (west) leads to a tunnel. At the end, a pull chain on the wall opens back to the central cavern with the fire pit.\nRetrieving the second key.\nThe right (north) bridge leads to a dirt path to the left that eventually comes to a set of stairs against the north wall. Proceeding up those stairs leads to a tunnel entrance to the north, which comes to a table with two &lt;a href=\"Burial%20Urn\"&gt;burial urns&lt;/a&gt; and a &lt;a href=\"Soul%20Gem%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;soul gem&lt;/a&gt;. The path turns left (west) down some stairs, then turns right again. On the right side is an adept-locked chest. The path continues to the left (west) down more stairs to a room with another etched tablet and nine stone squares on a raised platform, along with another inscription which Tharstan is able to read:\n\"\"I expect there's another riddle in here, along with a puzzle. \"Continue along the path, don't tread where you've been.\" Interesting... Well I'm pretty sure about two things. One, the riddle is most likely referring to these flat stone squares. And two, I'm not going anywhere near them.\"\"\nThe puzzle can be solved by starting at the bottom left (southeast) square and walking in a spiral pattern to the right (north), then to the top (west), then to the left (south), then left (east) only one square, and then left (north) one more square to the center. If done correctly, each square should have been walked across exactly once, and the spears blocking the next room will retract.\nThis room contains several draugr and a second boss-level draugr deathlord. After they have been defeated, the deathlord's body holds the &lt;a href=\"Amethyst%20Claw%2C%20Right%20Half\"&gt;Amethyst Claw, Right Half&lt;/a&gt;. A word wall for the second word for the shout Battle Fury is against the west wall of the room, with a chest in front. Tharstan remarks:\n\"Look! Here's another wall with dragon language inscriptions on it! Let's find out what's written here. This writing refers to a guardian who inspired both men and dragons. I wonder if the guardian was himself a man or a dragon?\"\nAs before, a narrow doorway to a shortcut has opened against the south wall that leads back to the main chamber. The Amethyst Claw halves fit into the keyholes on either side of the steps to the central caged platform. The gate will open, leading to another inscription and a handle. Tharstan says:\n\"\"Here's another riddle. \"Stay your course. To idle is to die.\" Well, at least it's straightforward. There appears to be a switch of some kind here. I'll just stand over here while you flip that switch. I'm sure everything will be fine.\"\"\nVahlok's bridge.\nTurning the handle activates a series of magical platforms which act as a bridge to reach the far side of the chamber. Each panel will disappear after a short period of time, so in order to prevent falling, it is necessary to travel across quickly, stepping onto the furthest available panel. Once the far side has been reached, a straight, solid path of panels form that lead back to the first platform. This allows Tharstan to cross. At the same time, an iron gate opens in the west wall. Just past the gate, a wooden door in the left wall is barred from the other side. If the Dragonborn falls from the bridge, there is a pathway from the water below that leads back up to the level of the bridges, through that wooden door.\nThe next three bridge sections of the ruin are much the same. Pulling the handle activates the moving bridge. Each bridge will move slightly faster than the last. In the canals below are several &lt;a href=\"Corrupted%20Shade%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Corrupted Shades&lt;/a&gt; that will attack anyone that falls down to them. After the first, another wooden door to the left is barred from the other side, and a table is straight ahead (west) with two burial urns and several gems. After the second, yet another barred wooden door is found, along with a soul gem. Again, if the Dragonborn falls off any bridge, there is a path back up through the barred wooden doors to the bridge level.\nAfter crossing all of them, the iron door opens on a long hall with a Dragon Claw combination door at the end. Tharstan remarks:\n\"Ah, the hall of stories. These are found in many ancient Nord tombs. There must be hundreds of years of history etched into these walls. Too bad they seem to be too damaged to read.Hmm... looks like it needs some sort of key. Maybe those half claws you found would fit in here if you put them together. It seems these rings can be moved. Perhaps there's enough undamaged text in these etchings to tell us the combination. Ah yes, here's something. The first one has to do with a breeze, or maybe it's wind. The second one mentions the night sky, and the moon. And the third has something to do with fire. It also seems to mention scales. That's all I can make out from this etching. I'll check the rest and see if there's anything else. You keep trying out the combination.\"\nThe combination is Hawk - Wolf - Dragon (from top to bottom), which does not appear on the claw, but which are hinted at by the etchings Tharstan found. Once the door opens, up the stairs is an iron gate opened by a pull chain that leads to the main burial chamber where &lt;a href=\"Vahlok%20the%20Jailor\"&gt;Vahlok the Jailor&lt;/a&gt; rests. The third word wall for Battle Fury is also found at the north end of this chamber, along with a small amount of leveled loot in a chest in front of it.\nFinal battle.\nThe paths on either side are covered with &lt;a href=\"Fire%20Trap\"&gt;fire traps&lt;/a&gt;. Approaching Vahlok's sarcophagus, much is the case with any other dragon priest, will cause him to awaken and attack after making his shriek upon rising from his sarcophagus. As battle begins he will summon a &lt;a href=\"Flame%20Atronach%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Flame Atronach&lt;/a&gt; and activate his &lt;a href=\"Flame%20Cloak\"&gt;Flame Cloak&lt;/a&gt;. During battle he uses &lt;a href=\"Fire%20Damage%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;fire based&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Destruction%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Destruction&lt;/a&gt; spells, including &lt;a href=\"Firebolt%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Firebolt&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Incinerate\"&gt;Incinerate&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Flames%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Flames&lt;/a&gt;.\nOnce Vahlok is defeated, Tharstan will pay 1,000 gold for escorting him through the dungeon, completing the quest. He will then run up to the Word Wall and begin studying it:\n\"Aha! Here's another of those dragon language inscriptions! I wonder what it says. Just let me study these runes for a moment. Hmm, here's another mention of the guardian. I can only assume that this is the guardian's tomb we are standing in now. It says that he was loyal, and his reward was an honorable death. Quite fascinating.\"\nOnce he has finished, he can be asked further about the origins and details of the tomb and how it relates to Vahlok and &lt;a href=\"Miraak\"&gt;Miraak&lt;/a&gt;.\n\"How amazing! A real Dragon Priest! In all my years as a historian, I never though I'd see anything like that. I suppose that was Vahlok. He must have had this entire place built for him so that he could maintain his vigil, even beyond death.\"\nHe must have been someone important. \"Indeed. I knew that the Dragon Priests were thought to have been powerful men of great will, but I had no idea. Well, I suppose I've seen everything I came for, and you kept up your end of the bargain. I promised payment and here it is.\"\nTharstan will stay behind, purportedly to study the Word Wall, where he will mention \"There's enough here for entire volumes!\"\nThe only exit from the dungeon is all the way back through to the beginning.\nDragon-Rune Tablets.\nThroughout Vahlok's Tomb there are three tablets displaying text in the &lt;a href=\"Atmoran\"&gt;ancient Nord&lt;/a&gt; language which gives hints to the three puzzles found within the tomb. The following are the direct quotes from the tablets.\nTablet I: \"A sacrifice will bring you closer to that which you seek.\"\nTablet II: \"Continue along the path, don't tread where you've been.\"\nTablet III: \"All Men must die, often by their own means.\""}

Much has been lost, fallen to the ravages of war or the turning of the ages. But nothing is ever truly forgotten. Where no records exist, legends and folk tales offer us a key to the past, a way to piece together truths half-remembered in the minds of men.\nFor generations, the people of &lt;a href=\"Morthal%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Morthal&lt;/a&gt; have told whispered tales of the &lt;a href=\"The%20Pale%20Lady%20%28Creature%29\"&gt;The Pale Lady&lt;/a&gt;, a ghostly woman who wanders the northern marshes, forever seeking her lost daughter. Some say she steals children who wander astray, others that her sobbing wail strikes dead all those who hear it. But behind these tales may lie a kernel of truth, for ancient records speak of '&lt;a href=\"Aumriel\"&gt;Aumriel&lt;/a&gt;,' a mysterious figure &lt;a href=\"Ysgramor%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Ysgramor's&lt;/a&gt; heirs battled for decades and finally sealed away.\n&lt;a href=\"Reachmen\"&gt;Reachmen&lt;/a&gt; tell the story of &lt;a href=\"Red%20Eagle\"&gt;Faolan 'Red-Eagle'&lt;/a&gt;, an ancient king who rallied his people and drove back the armies of &lt;a href=\"Cyrodiil\"&gt;Cyrodiil&lt;/a&gt; with a flaming sword. Though accounts vary, they too seem to be based on an underlying truth: the imperial chronicles of Empress &lt;a href=\"Hestra\"&gt;Hestra&lt;/a&gt; mention a rebel leader of that era who was eventually cornered and slain in battle, at the cost of a full legion of men.\nBut some tales prove far harder to analyze. Among scholars, perhaps the best known is the 'Forbidden Legend' of the &lt;a href=\"Arch-Mage\"&gt;Archmage&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Gauldur\"&gt;Gauldur&lt;/a&gt;.\nIn the dawning days of the &lt;a href=\"First%20Era\"&gt;First Era&lt;/a&gt;, the story goes, there lived a powerful wizard by the name of Gauldur. Wise and just, he was well known in the courts of King &lt;a href=\"Harald\"&gt;Harald&lt;/a&gt; and the Jarls of Skyrim, and his aid and counsel were sought by man and &lt;a href=\"mer\"&gt;mer&lt;/a&gt; alike.\nAnd then he was murdered. Some say one of his sons killed him, others that king Harald, jealous of his power, gave the order. But Gauldur's three sons fled into the night, pursued by a company of Harald's best warriors and the Lord &lt;a href=\"Geirmund\"&gt;Geirmund&lt;/a&gt;, the king's personal &lt;a href=\"battlemage\"&gt;battlemage&lt;/a&gt;.\nA great chase ensued, from the wilds of &lt;a href=\"the%20Reach\"&gt;the Reach&lt;/a&gt; to the glacial north. One brother is said to have perished in the ruins of &lt;a href=\"Folgunthur\"&gt;Folgunthur&lt;/a&gt;, at the Foot of &lt;a href=\"Solitude%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Solitude&lt;/a&gt;. The others were run to ground soon thereafter. And once it was done, king Harald ordered every record of their murders destroyed, and Gauldur's name and deeds were struck from the rolls of history.\nEven today, few sources remain, and no bard will tell the tale. But perhaps the truth yet remains in some ancient ruin, waiting to be unearthed. For nothing is ever truly forgotten."}

Hadrir left to purchase supplies in Riften, only to return to find Bern gone. No blood, signs of a struggle or any indication of why Bern left.\nHadrir left the journal behind saying that he \"Expected better\" of his old friend.\nIn reality, however, Bern discovered a &lt;a href=\"Gold%20ore%20vein\"&gt;Gold ore vein&lt;/a&gt; hidden in a tunnel behind the waterfall, and attempted to mine it.

There are two entrances to Lost Valkygg, which are fairly close to each other and near the circular barrow-like building in Labyrinthian where the &lt;a href=\"Wooden%20Mask\"&gt;Wooden Mask&lt;/a&gt; is located. The entrances are connected in the dungeon by a \"drop\" through a floor. Either entrance can be used, but it is impossible to access the main door and the larger part of the dungeon through the secondary entrance. It is possible to find and enter the secondary entrance first. The secondary entrance leads to a room with apparently nowhere else to go, and occupied by a very high-level &lt;a href=\"Draugr%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Draugr&lt;/a&gt;.\nTo reach the main entrance from the circular building where the Wooden Mask is located, begin by proceeding straight northeast from the mask building. One will reach a wall with a set of ascending stairs (climbing west to east) to the right and another set ascending in the same direction to the left. Go up the left set of stairs and turn right (south). Just ahead on the left is another set of ascending stairs. At the top of this second stairs is a pillar of rock on the left. Go past the pillar of rock and turn left. There will be a stack of stones that marks the main entrance, whose doors are partially visible. Descend the short stairs past the stack of stones to the doors.\nTo reach the secondary entrance after exiting from the main entrance, ascend the short set of stairs which lay ahead. Go forward past the tall pillar of rock and turn right; descend the stairs there. Then turn right (north), then left before the stone bridge to descend the second stairs\u2014these are the same two sets of stairs that were ascended to reach the main entrance. Turn left (south) at the bottom of the second stairs. Go forward (south) to the next set of ascending stairs on the left. The secondary entrance is at the top of these stairs, diagonally to the right ahead.\nTo reach the main entrance from the secondary entrance, exit the dungeon through the doorway to &lt;a href=\"Skyrim\"&gt;Skyrim&lt;/a&gt;. Turn right immediately. Directly ahead, one will see a set of stairs ascending left-to-right. Proceed to those stairs and ascend. At the top, turn right (south). Then ascend the stairs immediately ahead on the left. At the top is a pillar of rock on the left. Go past the pillar of rock and turn left. Ahead, there will be a stack of stones that marks the main entrance, which is partially visible. Descend the stairs past the stack of stones to the main entrance.\nWalkthrough.\n&lt;a href=\"Draugr%20Deathlord%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Draugr Deathlords&lt;/a&gt; may spawn from the very beginning (confirmed at level 1). This can make the tomb dangerous for low-level characters, especially if the Deathlords are using &lt;a href=\"Ebony%20Bow%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;ebony bows&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Ebony%20Arrow%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;arrows&lt;/a&gt; and use the full power of &lt;a href=\"Unrelenting%20Force%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Unrelenting Force&lt;/a&gt;.\nAfter entering via the main entrance, turn right (east) and head down a small flight of stairs before turning right again (south this time). Down some stairs is a window into a room with what seems like an altar and dead enemies (probably Draugr). Collect the &lt;a href=\"salt%20pile\"&gt;salt pile&lt;/a&gt; on the \"windowsill\" and head back to the pathway to the left (west). Beware the three &lt;a href=\"Traps%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;trap&lt;/a&gt; triggers on the ground. Before turning further down the path, loot the corner area.\nNow head left (south) down a dark passageway. Turn left again (this time east) and one will discover the two \"dead\" Draugr on the altar are not actually dead. Deal with them and move on. There is nothing straight ahead, so go right (south) down another small set of stairs. Loot the urns in the alcove to the left (south again). Now go down the southward passage into a large room.\nThe sarcophagus to the left will not open immediately, rather the Draugr inside will awaken when the battle with two free-roaming Draugr starts. Once all are dealt with, note the &lt;a href=\"Alchemy%20Lab%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;alchemy lab&lt;/a&gt; in the dark alcove to the right (north). Now head straight through the wooden door to the west. To the left (south) is an apprentice-locked trapped gate with urns, a salt pile, and a helmet behind it. The poison-dart trap cannot be disarmed, rather avoided by not stepping on the pressure plate directly in front of the gate.\nContinuing north, a Draugr will awaken and emerge from his coffin to attack. Kill him and loot the urns next to the pillar in the center of the hallway.\nLooking into the next room, a Draugr Deathlord will be spotted, but he likely will not spot the Dragonborn right away. This allows the chance of a sneak-attack for extra damage. He tends to walk into the next room, Either wait for him to return or chase after him. Either way, kill him and loot the chest before continuing. (Note: He wields particularly powerful arrows and a powerful bow.)\nIn the next room, one may notice that the floor is quite slanted. Head in and loot the boss chest next to the southern wall. Then, head back to the room where the three Draugr were fought.\nWalk down the hall and turn right (south) and go through the passage (note: There is a somewhat hard-to-see burial urn next to the west wall close to the doorway to this passage.) There is some gear and another burial urn on the shelf along the north wall. Pull the lever to open the gate. In this small room there is a pickpocket skill book \"Aevar Stone-Singer\" in this room, as well as an apothecary's satchel and a non-lootable skeleton chained to the east wall (possibly Aevar himself). If the Dragonborn takes the potato from the wooden plate on the ground, the skeleton will fall from its chains.\nAt this point, there are two options:\nFirst option: return to the room where the Draugr Deathlord was originally found. Immediately next to his chest is a large round hole in the floor. Looking down, there will be another floor below, which is the area otherwise accessible through the secondary entrance. If one jumps down the hole, save the game first. The Dragonborn will likely survive and land in an enclosed room with a second Draugr Deathlord, who will attack immediately. If one has a follower, they will likely not immediately dive down the hole after one has already jumped.\nSecond option: go back through the dungeon and exit through the main entrance, then go around and enter Lost Valkygg through the secondary dungeon entrance. Go down the ramp into a small enclosed area with the second Draugr Deathlord.\nAfter the second Draugr Deathlord has been killed, loot the chest on the rock shelf on the opposite side of the room. Exit the room through the door, which can be found at the top of some stairs. This is the secondary entrance and opens to Skyrim."}

The quest details the investigation of a lost ancient &lt;a href=\"Dwemer\"&gt;Dwemer&lt;/a&gt; secret and the search for four pieces of solid &lt;a href=\"Aetherium\"&gt;Aetherium&lt;/a&gt;. It can be started by locating and reading a copy of the book \"&lt;a href=\"The%20Aetherium%20Wars\"&gt;The Aetherium Wars&lt;/a&gt;\". It can also be started by entering &lt;a href=\"Arkngthamz\"&gt;Arkngthamz&lt;/a&gt; and talking to &lt;a href=\"Katria\"&gt;Katria&lt;/a&gt;, skipping directly to the second part of the quest.\nBackground.\n\"In Arkngthamz, I met Katria, the ghost of an adventurer who perished there. She offered to join me in my fight to the summit, and I accepted her help.\"\nWalkthrough.\nAfter finding a copy of \"The Aetherium Wars\" and reading it, a miscellaneous task of traveling to &lt;a href=\"Arkngthamz\"&gt;Arkngthamz&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"The%20Reach\"&gt;The Reach&lt;/a&gt; will appear in the Quest Log.\nUpon arriving at Arkngthamz, the earth will quiver, followed by a disembodied voice that can be heard warning the &lt;a href=\"Last%20Dragonborn\"&gt;Dragonborn&lt;/a&gt; to turn back. When continuing through the ruin, the disembodied voice will be given a name \u2014 a female Nord named Katria who will reveal that she is on the quest to find the mythical &lt;a href=\"Aetherium%20Forge\"&gt;Aetherium Forge&lt;/a&gt;. She reveals that she died during an earthquake in the &lt;a href=\"Dwemer%20Ruins%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Dwemer ruin&lt;/a&gt;.\n&lt;a href=\"Katria%27s%20Journal\"&gt;Katria's Journal&lt;/a&gt; can be found on her body. In it, she expresses her displeasure that her former colleague, &lt;a href=\"Taron%20Dreth\"&gt;Taron Dreth&lt;/a&gt; (the author of \"The Aetherium Wars\") stole her research to publish the book, but she insists that she alone has the leads for the locations of Aetherium and possibly where the Forge may be located.\nThe ethereal Katria aids the Dragonborn in retrieving the first of the four &lt;a href=\"aetherium%20shard\"&gt;aetherium shard&lt;/a&gt;s needed to unlock the Forge, and thus the quest \"Lost to the Ages\" begins, with the task of finding the Aetherium shards.\nArkngthamz.\nReading \"The Aetherium Wars\" will create a marker at the Dwemer ruins of &lt;a href=\"Arkngthamz\"&gt;Arkngthamz&lt;/a&gt; located in &lt;a href=\"The%20Reach%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;The Reach&lt;/a&gt; near &lt;a href=\"Dushnikh%20Yal\"&gt;Dushnikh Yal&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Valthume%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Valthume&lt;/a&gt;. There the Dragonborn encounters the corpse of a female Nord named Katria and finds a journal on her body that illustrates her findings regarding the Aetherium Forge and the ruins of Arkngthamz.\nAfter reading the journal, the ghost of Katria appears and explains that she wishes to complete her research and find the Forge. She attempts to discourage anyone from venturing further into the ruin and insists on accompanying them through the ruin to the Summit. In the same room, she will ask the Dragonborn to retrieve the journal from her body on the small middle island they cross. If they look up from her body, they will see a log jutting out over the chasm, which is where they later find Katria's bow, &lt;a href=\"Zephyr\"&gt;Zephyr&lt;/a&gt;, and being the spot where she fell to her death when the quake happened.\nTraverse up several levels of shattered earth and Dwemer steam pipelines. Along the way, Katria will comment on various enemies and possibly warn of upcoming ambushes. Shortly past a falmer camp containing chaurus, she will comment on the spot where she fell through the ground. In dialogue, she reveals that had she fallen two feet more to the left she would have landed in the water and survived. Upon reaching the log where the bow lies, she will comment on it.\nRetrieving the bow, either physically or using &lt;a href=\"Telekinesis%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Telekinesis&lt;/a&gt;, reveals that it is a &lt;a href=\"Dwarven%20Bow%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Dwarven bow&lt;/a&gt; with an inherent &lt;a href=\"Enchanting%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;enchantment&lt;/a&gt; allowing it to fire 30% faster than normal bows.\nTonal lock.\nDeep in the ruin\u2014just past Zephyr\u2014is a large antechamber with several falmer corpses, skeletons, and destroyed Dwemer spheres and spiders that lay strewn about with Dwarven arrows. Katria warns that this is an extremely effective\u2014and lethal\u2014security mechanism. The kinetic resonators have to be hit in a specific order to unlock the door, and that when she hit them in the wrong order it caused the earthquake. Katria has the first two successfully numbered in her book. A note found on a &lt;a href=\"Scrap%20of%20Paper\"&gt;nearby dead adventurer&lt;/a&gt; reveals the third. Katria advises that they all have a certain pattern.\nThe pattern in this room is to shoot the first on the bottom left, then the one on the bottom right, then shoot the one on the top left, then the top right, then the bottom center, and the door will unlock. Shooting in the wrong order will trigger this series of traps.\nIf the player did not bring a bow, then Zephyr will need to be used; alternatively, one can cast projectile-type spells at the tonal locks.\nRetrieve the aetherium shard in the unlocked room. Katria will say that she will go out into the world searching for the remaining three and advises the reading of her journal to see where the others are located. She will appear at each subsequent location once they are found.\nNote that the map arrows pointing to the shard locations are selected at random, so the order in which each Shard is located can change from what appears below. Also note that when surfacing from Arkngthamz, up to three map markers will have been added to the map if the locations were already discovered; if not, then the shards will not be marked, and so Katria's Journal must be used to locate the respective locations.\nDeep Folk Crossing.\nThe description for the location numbered \"2\", &lt;a href=\"Deep%20Folk%20Crossing%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Deep Folk Crossing&lt;/a&gt;, in \"Katria's Journal\", mentions a Bthar-zel, which is northeast of &lt;a href=\"Bthardamz%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Bthardamz&lt;/a&gt;, northwest of &lt;a href=\"Druadach%20Redoubt%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Druadach Redoubt&lt;/a&gt;, and southwest of &lt;a href=\"Mor%20Khazgur%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Mor Khazgur&lt;/a&gt;; it is located far to the north of the &lt;a href=\"Reach%20Imperial%20Camp\"&gt;Reach Imperial Camp&lt;/a&gt;.\nDeep Folk Crossing is a Dwemer bridge going over a river. Venture across it to the north side and up a slope to retrieve the next Shard atop a plinth (along with a Dwarven helmet, Dwarven sword, and a Dwemer Convector).\nRaldbthar.\nThe location numbered \"3\" in \"Katria's Journal\" is located in &lt;a href=\"Raldbthar\"&gt;Raldbthar&lt;/a&gt;. Should the quest \"&lt;a href=\"Mourning%20Never%20Comes\"&gt;Mourning Never Comes&lt;/a&gt;\" for the &lt;a href=\"Dark%20Brotherhood%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Dark Brotherhood&lt;/a&gt; be started, then the ruin should be at least partly cleared. If not, the ruin is on a summit located east of the &lt;a href=\"Dragon%20Lairs\"&gt;dragon lair&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Shearpoint\"&gt;Shearpoint&lt;/a&gt;, northwest of &lt;a href=\"Gallows%20Rock\"&gt;Gallows Rock&lt;/a&gt;, and southwest of &lt;a href=\"Anga%27s%20Mill\"&gt;Anga's Mill&lt;/a&gt;.\nAfter fighting through the ruin, the second main area reached is called Raldbthar Deep Market. A room with four buttons will be reached; press the button that is second from the right to remove the metal bars. A little deeper in, there is a room filled with Dwemer gears, Falmer, and chaurus. The area needs to be cleared by removing the blockages (skull, leg bone, human spine, and Dwemer scrap metal) from the different gears. The hardest to find is the Dwemer scrap metal embedded in a submerged gear under the water. When all blockages are cleared, the power should return to the button that lowers the bridge, and the bridge can be crossed to fight a leveled &lt;a href=\"Dwarven%20Centurion%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Dwarven Centurion&lt;/a&gt;. The Centurion can be bypassed by raising the bridge when it is on it, then shooting it. It will march forward into the water, and slowly die.\nAfter the Centurion is defeated, continue into a series of rooms where Katria will join in fighting some leveled Spiders and Spheres to locate the next shard. Take the lift across from the room back up to Skyrim to continue the quest.\nMzulft.\nThe location numbered \"4\" in \"Katria's Journal\" is where the next Shard is located, in the &lt;a href=\"Dwarven%20Storeroom\"&gt;Dwarven Storeroom&lt;/a&gt; south of the entrance into &lt;a href=\"Mzulft%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Mzulft&lt;/a&gt;. It is found along the eastern side of the mountains of &lt;a href=\"Eastmarch%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Eastmarch&lt;/a&gt;, southeast of &lt;a href=\"Windhelm%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Windhelm&lt;/a&gt;, and directly north of &lt;a href=\"Cragslane%20Cavern\"&gt;Cragslane Cavern&lt;/a&gt;. It is also directly east of &lt;a href=\"Steamcrag%20Camp\"&gt;Steamcrag Camp&lt;/a&gt;.\nIf the chamber has not already been cleared, it is just a room with two apprentice level locks and one expert level lock filled with Dwemer metals, scraps, cogs, gyros, &lt;a href=\"Dwarven%20metal%20ingot\"&gt;Dwarven metal ingot&lt;/a&gt;s and a Dwemer convector. Only two out of three doors are needed to be opened in order to retrieve this Shard and the rest of the loot.\nRegardless of what order the shards are found in, upon finding the fourth shard Katria will state that all that is left to do is find the Forge.\nAetherium Forge.\nUpon consulting Katria's Journal, the fifth point shows the Forge to be west of the Lake Honrich. In reality, it is slightly southwest and much farther. It is the &lt;a href=\"Ruins%20of%20Bthalft\"&gt;Ruins of Bthalft&lt;/a&gt;, which is located south of &lt;a href=\"Ivarstead%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Ivarstead&lt;/a&gt; and east of the &lt;a href=\"Rift%20Imperial%20Camp\"&gt;Rift Imperial Camp&lt;/a&gt;.\nUpon arriving at the Forge location, bandits will attack. After dispatching them, place the aetherium shards on a Dwemer Globe that Katria points out. The ground starts shaking violently, and Katria advises standing back on a wooden platform. The globe will shoot up into the sky and reveal a lift underneath.\nTake the lift down into the abandoned Dwemer ruin and find the way through, where Katria will remark that no-one has set foot there in over four thousand years. Torches and beacons automatically light the way.\nAt the main antechamber before the Forge, a massive locked door will be in the way. Above the door are two Kinetic Resonators. Shoot them both, and the Forge Room will be opened.\nThe Forge room.\nUpon entering, steam will be rising from a grate in the center; use the valves to shut off the steam and approach the forge. Upon the approach, a new objective becomes evident: defeat the Forge's Guardians, who will appear and immediately attack. Fight off Dwemer spiders, Dwemer spider guardians, and warped Dwemer spiders.\nAfter defeating the spiders, Dwarven spheres, sphere guardians, and warped spheres will join the fray, and the steam will turn back on. Using the valves, turn it off again and return to the fight.\nIt is recommended to fight on the top decks near the valves and use the steps as a funnel. Katria will either dual wield daggers or use Zephyr. A good tactic is to make use of the &lt;a href=\"Unrelenting%20Force%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Unrelenting Force&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Fire%20Breath%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Fire Breath&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"Frost%20Breath\"&gt;Frost Breath&lt;/a&gt;, and area of effect Destruction magic to whittle down the animunculi's strength.\nAfter defeating these, &lt;a href=\"The%20Forgemaster%20%28Dawnguard%29\"&gt;the Forgemaster&lt;/a&gt; will appear out of the lava behind the Forge. It is the most powerful Dwarven Centurion Master known, and can breathe fire (instead of steam, like other centurions) and is resistant to fire damage. Katria, being a spirit, can prove her worth against it, and if one has multiple companions, they too will be a formidable match, as will essential followers.\nAfter defeating the Forgemaster, Katria says to get some supplies from the chest near the Forge (unless some were brought along) and the aetherium Forge can be used to craft one item from the Aetherium Shards.\nThere are two gates that seem to just lead into the lava on either side of the forge. If &lt;a href=\"Become%20Ethereal\"&gt;Become Ethereal&lt;/a&gt; is used, one can swim in it. If by any chance &lt;a href=\"Ahzidal%27s%20Boots%20of%20Waterwalking\"&gt;Ahzidal's Boots of Waterwalking&lt;/a&gt; are possessed or the Dragonborn is a &lt;a href=\"Vampire%20Lord\"&gt;Vampire Lord&lt;/a&gt;, the lava can be traversed, but the fire damage will still be taken. &lt;a href=\"Whirlwind%20Sprint\"&gt;Whirlwind Sprint&lt;/a&gt; can also be used to explore the area.\nUsing the Become Ethereal shout, take the left path up to a small chest and another on the right. These paths lead to an overlook position of the forge, making it easier to shoot enemies from a distance.\nStraight back from the forge is a large chest. To get to it, use the Become Ethereal shout to swim from the right side of the forge to the small island in the middle of the lava, then turn slightly left and the small alcove with the chest in can be seen. It is also a good idea to have resist fire potions because it is a long swim, and the islands are small. Full magic resistance will work as well. Also using a resist fire potion of 60% or higher and &lt;a href=\"Whirlwind%20Sprint\"&gt;Whirlwind Sprint&lt;/a&gt; to reach the middle island is advised. Stop and restore health and allow the Shout capability to rebuild, then drink another Resist Fire potion and Whirlwind Sprint to the chest. Another resist fire potion and Whirlwind Sprint will allow access to the left ramp back to the forge.\nThe Aetherial equipment.\nThe Dragonborn can choose from three pieces of equipment. However, only one can be chosen.\nAfter forging the selected item, Katria comments on whichever item which was chosen to be forged, and mentions that there most likely is not any more aetherium in Skyrim. With a sigh of relief, she thanks the Dragonborn and expresses that she is finally at rest, and after a few final departing words, she fades away, to take her place among the honored in &lt;a href=\"Sovngarde%20%28Location%29\"&gt;Sovngarde&lt;/a&gt;. This completes the quest, and awards the Achievement (Xbox360) or Trophy (PS3) \"Lost to the Ages.\"\nAfter the quest.\nWhen the quest is complete, Katria says,\n\"And now... I think I can rest. Farewell, my friend, wherever your travels take you.\"\nShe then disappears (with a bow of gratitude), bound for Sovngarde. Despite this, if the &lt;a href=\"Sovngarde%20%28Quest%29\"&gt;Sovngarde&lt;/a&gt; quest is done after this one, she will not be found there.\nAfter completion of \"Lost to the Ages,\" Taron Dreth can appear as a &lt;a href=\"Random%20Encounters%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;random encounter&lt;/a&gt; along the roads with three mercenaries in tow. If the Dragonborn has one of the items forged out of Aetherium (the &lt;a href=\"Aetherial%20crown\"&gt;Aetherial crown&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Aetherial%20Shield\"&gt;shield&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"Aetherial%20Staff\"&gt;staff&lt;/a&gt;) in their possession, Dreth will ask the Dragonborn how they acquired this item. He will initiate combat with the Dragonborn no matter which dialogue option is chosen."}

The center of Inner Loth'Na is a tall hill with stones jutting out the area and &lt;a href=\"Nirncrux\"&gt;Nirncrux&lt;/a&gt; veins located throughout the area. There is a small river that runs through the southern end of the cave, and it continues into the Druadach Mountains and the rest of Craglorn. Loth'Na is located north of the ruins of &lt;a href=\"Skyreach\"&gt;Skyreach&lt;/a&gt;, which was originally a city built by the &lt;a href=\"Nedes\"&gt;Nedes&lt;/a&gt; of Hammerfell. The outer ruins of Skyreach are located on the mountaintops of Upper Craglorn, with bridges connecting them to the higher roads in Craglorn. Located in Loth'Na is the Skyreach Temple, which makes sense considering the caves proximity to Skyreach.\nHistory.\n&lt;a href=\"Second%20Era\"&gt;Second Era&lt;/a&gt;.\nDuring the &lt;a href=\"Interregnum\"&gt;Interregnum&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"2E%20582\"&gt;2E 582&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"Scaled%20Court\"&gt;Scaled Court&lt;/a&gt; had worshipped &lt;a href=\"the%20Serpent%20%28Celestial%29\"&gt;the Serpent&lt;/a&gt; and considered him a powerful being. The Scaled Court began to arose throughout Upper Craglorn, making a pact with the &lt;a href=\"Iron%20Orcs\"&gt;Iron Orcs&lt;/a&gt; of the region. &lt;a href=\"Regent%20Cassipia\"&gt;Regent Cassipia&lt;/a&gt; of the Scaled Court desired to gain the same powers as the Serpent, posing a great threat to the denizens of Craglorn. With the help of a traveler known as the &lt;a href=\"Vestige\"&gt;Vestige&lt;/a&gt;, Regent Cassipia was able to destroy the &lt;a href=\"Mantikora\"&gt;Mantikora&lt;/a&gt; and defeat the Nirncrux-infused Iron Orcs. Cassipia and &lt;a href=\"Little%20Leaf\"&gt;Little Leaf&lt;/a&gt;, her partner in crime, traveled to the Skyreach Temple in Loth'Na Caverns to complete the process but was interrupted by the Vestige, &lt;a href=\"The%20Thief%20%28Celestial%29\"&gt;the Thief&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Titus%20Valerius\"&gt;Titus Valerius&lt;/a&gt;. The Vestige defeated both the Exalted Viper and Little Leaf's spirit, saving both Craglorn and the rest of Tamriel from the wrath of the Exalted Viper.\n&lt;a href=\"Third%20Era\"&gt;Third Era&lt;/a&gt;.\nDuring the &lt;a href=\"Imperial%20Simulacrum\"&gt;Imperial Simulacrum&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"3E%20397\"&gt;3E 397&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"Nords\"&gt;Nords&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"Skyrim\"&gt;Skyrim&lt;/a&gt; under &lt;a href=\"General%20Duvais\"&gt;General Duvais&lt;/a&gt;, besieged the city of &lt;a href=\"Dragonstar\"&gt;Dragonstar&lt;/a&gt; and taken control of the Eastern side of Dragonstar, oppressing the denizens of the city. Duvais and his men discovered a powerful crystal deep within Loth'Na and utilized it to enhance their power and kill pilgrims coming to Loth'Na. &lt;a href=\"Porliss%20Caith\"&gt;Porliss Caith&lt;/a&gt; of Dragonstar tasked an &lt;a href=\"Soul%20of%20Conflict\"&gt;estranged warrior&lt;/a&gt; to eliminate Duvais in Loth'Na and to secure the area for pilgrims to come and worship as they please. The crystal that Duvais used had killed several pilgrims, causing their spirits to remain on Nirn. The same warrior aided the spirits and brought them to &lt;a href=\"Aetherius\"&gt;Aetherius&lt;/a&gt;."}

My actions there are in direct response to the owner's sudden silence and lack of cooperation with the Thieves Guild and Maven Black-Briar, one of the Guild's most important clients.\"\nWalkthrough.\nFirst, the &lt;a href=\"Last%20Dragonborn\"&gt;Dragonborn&lt;/a&gt; needs to follow Brynjolf into the &lt;a href=\"The%20Ragged%20Flagon%20-%20Cistern\"&gt;The Ragged Flagon - Cistern&lt;/a&gt;. The entrance is hidden behind a wardrobe in the hallway past the bar, just off to the side of the door leading to &lt;a href=\"The%20Ratway%20Vaults\"&gt;The Ratway Vaults&lt;/a&gt;. Once inside the cistern they need to speak to Mercer Frey, the &lt;a href=\"Guildmaster\"&gt;Guildmaster&lt;/a&gt; of the Thieves Guild. He is found either standing near his desk or wandering the main area. Mercer will assign the Dragonborn the first job in the Thieves Guild, which requires the Dragonborn to go to the Goldenglow Estate to teach the proprietor a lesson. Before going there, the Dragonborn can optionally talk to Vex in order to discover the location of the secret entrance to the estate. When the Dragonborn reaches the Goldenglow Estate, they have to burn three hives and empty the safe in the house.\nBurning the hives.\nThe bee hives are marked on the map. The easiest path to reach them is from the rocks below the northwestern side of the island by jumping on them. The easiest way to burn them is with the &lt;a href=\"Flames%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Flames&lt;/a&gt; spell or to shoot them using a bow enchanted to cause fire damage. If the Dragonborn's equipped weapon has a fire damage enchantment, or if they are holding a torch, just walking close to a beehive will set it on fire. If the Dragonborn burns any more than three, Brynjolf will be displeased, refusing to reward the Dragonborn for disobeying orders. If the Dragonborn has been detected, it is advisable to jump into the lake behind the house and swim for a little while until they are hidden.\nEmptying the safe.\nIn order to reach the safe, one must pick the expert locked door first. To reach the door, the Dragonborn can either use the sewers, about which they find out after talking with Vex, or swim around the estate until they reach the door with the quest mark.\nOnce in the house, the Dragonborn must open the expert locked safe. Before going for the safe, it is advisable to get the key held by Aringoth. In order to reach Aringoth, the Dragonborn must sneak past mercenaries to the second floor of the Goldenglow Estate.\nOnce on the second floor, the Dragonborn must again sneak past mercenaries and reach Aringoth, who is sitting on the chair in a corner of his room. He can be either persuaded or intimidated to give the key to the Dragonborn. If both attempts fail, he will turn hostile upon exiting the conversation; however, killing him does not fail the quest in any way and the Dragonborn will still receive payment. When Aringoth turns hostile, or after successfully speaking to him, all mercenaries on the second floor are alert and looking for the Dragonborn; if all of them have been killed three new mercenaries spawn on the first floor. Still there is no need in killing them, since after getting the key from the owner's body and immediately leaving the second floor the mercenaries will get back to their normal patrolling routes and will not leave the second floor in order to chase the Dragonborn. Alternatively, one can jump on Aringoth's head and then crouch. Once the Dragonborn is \"hidden,\" they can &lt;a href=\"pickpocket\"&gt;pickpocket&lt;/a&gt; his key.\nThe &lt;a href=\"queen%20bee%20statue\"&gt;queen bee statue&lt;/a&gt; on the right of Aringoth's bed is a larceny target and the Dragonborn will be rewarded with &lt;a href=\"Septim%20%28Coin%29\"&gt;gold&lt;/a&gt; if returned to &lt;a href=\"Delvin%20Mallory%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Delvin Mallory&lt;/a&gt; back in the Ragged Flagon. After that, it can be found on the bookshelf behind the Guildmaster's desk in the Cistern.\nOnce the second floor is left, the Dragonborn needs to make their way to the basement, which is through a steel barred gate, in the same hallway of the patrolling guard. When in the basement, one needs to sneak through the mercenaries. It is possible to sneak easily past all of the guards, except for the last one. For the last one, the Dragonborn must either use a &lt;a href=\"Potions%20%28Skyrim%29%23Invisibility\"&gt;Potion of Invisibility&lt;/a&gt;, use the &lt;a href=\"Throw%20Voice\"&gt;Throw Voice&lt;/a&gt; Shout to send him away, fire an arrow into the next room, or\u2014if you can get close enough without being detected\u2014 put a bucket over the guard's head. The Dragonborn can also sneak past him by going in front of him, then cut back to the door.\nIf all else fails, the Dragonborn can run and quickly take items from the safe and leave the basement with all guards there being hostile.\nIf the Dragonborn picked Aringoth's pockets or looted the key from his corpse, the safe will unlock effortlessly.\nReturning to Brynjolf.\nAfter the Dragonborn escapes the estate, they need to return to Brynjolf and inform him of what they have found, the \"&lt;a href=\"Goldenglow%20Bill%20of%20Sale\"&gt;Goldenglow Bill of Sale&lt;/a&gt;\". He will be in the cistern. An easier way to get there is to go to &lt;a href=\"Riften%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Riften&lt;/a&gt;'s graveyard, and press the button on the large tomb to reveal a secret passageway. This leads straight back to the cistern without having to retrace the path through the Ratway to the Ragged Flagon."}

While visiting the demons of the Haight last night, I was handed the document that follows. I was drunk, so I cannot describe the courier, but I can verify that it is, indeed, from the Fifth Era(!) of &lt;a href=\"Tamriel\"&gt;Tamriel&lt;/a&gt; from an author unknown to me, even in visions.\nIt will be of interest to many lore scholars here; indeed, since it concerns &lt;a href=\"Vivec\"&gt;Vivec&lt;/a&gt;'s \u201cScripture of Love\u201d it was very much of interest to me.\nEnjoy.\n\"Ald Sotha Below, 5E911House Sul Progenitor House, duly noted under the digital house,Whirling School Prefect ApprovedChronocule Delivery: souljewel count: 78888-00-00-00-000\"\nMy name is Jubal-lun-Sul, of House Sul, whose name is known and heard throughout the Scathing Bay and the Nine times Nine Thrones. Our lord is High Alma Jaroon, of House Jaroon, whose city is the First City of the New North, where all who Went Under from &lt;a href=\"Landfall\"&gt;Landfall&lt;/a&gt; settled and made peace with the Worm, when we were not Eighty and One separate peoples but One, carrying the tibrols on our back together and cutting tunnels by the light and heat that all &lt;a href=\"mer\"&gt;mer&lt;/a&gt; wore, with equal dust in every mouth. My family\u2019s name comes from the first child born in the Velothiid, Haeko-dol-Sul, and, like him, we are salt merchants. Our crest is the tusk of the bat-tiger. Our bloodline is registered by C0DA.\nThe Digitals say we come from another star, but so many have forgotten. I have not, for my lineage granted me audience with Memory, and I have spoken with the Wheels of Lull. I have seen proof, as any who come Up during Landfall Season, when the winds die down enough Above that all may make pilgrimage under the banner of &lt;a href=\"Vehk\"&gt;Vehk&lt;/a&gt; and Vehk. Though many Above have renounced Memory, they too remember.\nI tell you now, brothers and sisters of the coming &lt;a href=\"Fourth%20Era\"&gt;4th&lt;/a&gt;, that the holy Scripture of Love contains all you need to avoid the perils of the Landfall. By chronocules granted by the \u2018neers of Lull, this warning is given freely and by Love. &lt;a href=\"36%20Lessons%20of%20Vivec%2C%20Sermon%2035\"&gt;Sermon 35&lt;/a&gt; begins properly:\n\"\u201cThe formulas of proper Velothi magic continue in ancient tradition, but that virility is dead, by which I mean at least replaced. Truth owes its medicinal nature to the establishment of the myth of justice. Its curative properties it likewise owes to the concept of sacrifice. Princes, chiefs, and angels all subscribe to the same notion. This is a view primarily based on a prolific abolition of an implied profanity, seen in ceremonies, knife fighting, hunting, and the exploration of the poetic. On the ritual of occasions, which comes to us from the days of the cave glow, I can say nothing more than to loosen your equation of moods to lunar currency.\u201d\"\nThe C0DA broke when Twice Vehk appeared again from &lt;a href=\"Aetherius\"&gt;Aether&lt;/a&gt;, but they captured enough of Him to render the words stable again. In this passage, He describes the goal of the Lunar God, who some of you still ascribe the name \u201c&lt;a href=\"Lorkhan\"&gt;Lorkhan&lt;/a&gt;\u201d. When stabilized, the words become proof:\nAll creation is subgradient. First was &lt;a href=\"Void\"&gt;Void&lt;/a&gt;, which became split by AE. &lt;a href=\"Anu\"&gt;Anu&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Padomay\"&gt;Padomay&lt;/a&gt; came next and with their first brush came the &lt;a href=\"Aurbis\"&gt;Aurbis&lt;/a&gt;.\nVoid to Aurbis: naught to pattern.\n\"\u201cLater, and by that I mean much, much later, my reign will be seen as an act of the highest love, which is a return from the astral destiny and the marriages between. By that I mean the catastrophes, which will come from all five corners. Subsequent are the revisions, differentiated between hope and the distraught, situations that are only required by the periodic death of the immutable. Cosmic time is repeated: I wrote of this in an earlier life. An imitation of submersion is love's premonition, its folly into the underworld, by which I mean the day you will read about outside of yourself in an age of gold. For on that day, which is a shadow of the sacrificial concept, all history is obliged to see me for what you are: in love with evil.\u201d\"\nThe marriages of the Aether describe the birth of all magic. Like a pregnant [untranslatable], the Aurbis exploded with its surplus. Will formed and, with it, the Potential to Action. This is the advent of the first Digitals: &lt;a href=\"Mantellan%20Crux\"&gt;mantellian&lt;/a&gt;, mnemolia, the aetherial realm of the &lt;a href=\"Et%27ada\"&gt;etada&lt;/a&gt;. The Head of this order is &lt;a href=\"Magnus\"&gt;Magnus&lt;/a&gt;, but he is not its Ward, for even he was subcreated by the birth of &lt;a href=\"Akatosh\"&gt;Akatosh&lt;/a&gt;.\nAurbis to Aetherius: possibility to maintenance by time.\n\"\u201cTo keep one's powers intact at such a stage is to allow for the existence of what can only be called a continual spirit. Make of your love a defense against the horizon. Pure existence is only granted to the holy, which comes in a myriad of forms, half of them frightening and the other half divided into equal parts purposeless and assured. Late is the lover that comes to this by any other walking way than the fifth, which is the number of the limit of this world. The lover is the highest country and a series of beliefs. He is the sacred city bereft of a double. The uncultivated land of monsters is the rule. This is clearly attested by ANU and his double, which love knows never really happened.\u201d\"\nLull calls this a refutation of sorts, but the wise may know it as the first appearance of Nu-Mantia, which is Liberty. Rather, the road to Liberty.\nAnother subcreation happened to the wheels of the etada, a shore that all of creation crashed against, the terminus of limits known as &lt;a href=\"Oblivion%20%28Realm%29\"&gt;Oblivion&lt;/a&gt;. An echo of the Void before but unalike, many spirits fled here and came to power by merely harnessing the impossibility of Limit+All.\nAetherius to Oblivion: creation to destruction.\n\"\u201cSimilarly, all the other symbols of absolute reality are ancient ideas ready for their graves, or at least the essence of such. This scripture is directly ordered by the codes of &lt;a href=\"Mephala\"&gt;Mephala&lt;/a&gt;, the origin of sex and murder, defeated only by those who take up those ideas without my intervention. The religious elite is not a tendency or a correlation. They are dogma complemented by the influence of the untrustworthy sea and the governance of the stars, dominated at the center by the sword, which is nothing without a victim to cleave unto. This is the love of God and he would show you more: predatory but at the same time instrumental to the will of critical harvest, a scenario by which one becomes as he is, of male and female, the magic &lt;a href=\"hermaphrodite\"&gt;hermaphrodite&lt;/a&gt;.\u201d\"\nWe begin to see the first inkling of emergence, which by its nature requires the merging of two-fold powers. Inevitably, this leads to another gradient, but this time by forceful process: the Trap of the Lunar God. The &lt;a href=\"Aedra\"&gt;Aedra&lt;/a&gt; are Named at this time, having lent their hands to what was to be the arena of the eternally impossible: &lt;a href=\"Mundus\"&gt;Mundus&lt;/a&gt;, or Exactness.\nOblivion to Mundus: debris of all possibility to anchor of all things.\n\"\u201cMark the norms of violence and it barely registers, suspended as it is by treaties written between the original spirits.\u201d\"\nWhen one visits Memory, you become filled with the first ideas of the Lunar God, and see the trap within the trap. Vehk knows it at this point, and sees for all of you, and realizes the need for treaty: avenue of escape, first stone.\nC0DA translation: if all previous gradients continue along this path, especially given that there is now a centerpoint, impossible Mundus, the process of continuation can be pre-figured.\nThe echo of the Void is Oblivion. The echo of Oblivion is now mortal death. Death results in reappropriation of spirit towards its aligned AE\u2014either to the god-planet Aedra or the Principalities of Oblivion. Vehk\u2019s name for this transaction, mentioned above, is \u201clunar currency\u201d.\nAE CHIM NU-MEN NU-MANTIA\nMundus to Mortal Death: centerpoint to the soon recycled.\n\"\u201cThis should be seen as an opportunity, and in no way tedious, though some will give up for it is easier to kiss the lover than become one.\u201d\"\nHere we come to the Scripture\u2019s greatest resignation: to imagine the subcreation AFTER mortal death, which by pattern would mean an echo of Mundus, and through this imagining, the failures of so many.\nThe Digitals' record of the Lunar God\u2019s involvement in all of this is called the Great Pain: \"\u201cThe Lunar God failed by his own devices, to show the new progeny how they might not.\u201d\"\nYou in the &lt;a href=\"Fourth%20Era\"&gt;Fourth Era&lt;/a&gt; have already witnessed many of the attempts at reaching the final subgradient of all AE, that state that exists beyond mortal death. The &lt;a href=\"Numidium\"&gt;Numidium&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href=\"The%20Endeavor\"&gt;The Endeavor&lt;/a&gt;. The Prolix Tower. &lt;a href=\"CHIM\"&gt;CHIM&lt;/a&gt;. The &lt;a href=\"Enantiomorph\"&gt;Enantiomorph&lt;/a&gt;. The Scarab that Transforms into the New Man.\nSimply put, as the Gods cannot know joy as mortals, their creation, so mortals may only understand the joy of Liberty by becoming the progenitors of the models that can make the jump past mortal death.\nAnd so many of you give up.\nMortal Death to Z (Z being the state-gradient echo of Mundus Centerex): antinymic to [untranslatable].\n\"\u201cThe lower regions crawl with these souls, caves of shallow treasures, meeting in places to testify by way of extension, when love is only satisfied by a considerable (incalculable) effort.\u201d\"\nThose who do not fail become the New Men: an individual beyond all AE, unerased and all-being. Jumping beyond the last bridge of all existence is the Last Existence, The Eternal I.\nI AM.\nA whole World of You.\nGod.\nGod outside of all else but his own free consciousness, hallucinating for eternity and falling into love: I AM AND I ARE ALL WE.\nC0DA Digitals have confirmed that a subject in sensory deprivation begins to hallucinate after only twenty minutes. Scale unto this along the magical spectrum and maintenance of time, which is forever, and you begin to see the Lunar God\u2019s failure as Greatest Gift. As above, \"\u201cThis is the love of God.\u201d\"\nWhy Love?\nKnow Love to avoid the Landfall, my brothers and sisters of the past.\nThe New Man becomes God becomes Amaranth, everlasting hypnogogic. Hallucinations become lucid under His eye and therefore, like all parents of their children, the Amaranth cherishes and adores all that is come from Him.\nI ARE ALL WE.\nGod is Love.\nCOME TO THE HOUSE OF WE.\nGod is Love.\nONE WORLD IN SPIRIT I AM.\nGod is Love.\nAnd that is how the message ended. Do with it what you will and freely discuss. I know what I am doing with it, but then, I\u2019ve been trying and trying for years. \u201cConsiderable effort\u201d, indeed. \nAnd perhaps it is no accident that this falls on 9/11. Love to its Memory. And my love to Kurt Kuhlmann, whose birthday was destroyed by the will of critical harvest. \n-MK"}

Once there, he came into possession of the &lt;a href=\"Blade%20of%20Woe\"&gt;Blade of Woe&lt;/a&gt;, and eventually became a Speaker for the infamous underground society known as the &lt;a href=\"Dark%20Brotherhood\"&gt;Dark Brotherhood&lt;/a&gt;, after the previous Speaker died fulfilling a contract. The &lt;a href=\"Hero%20of%20Kvatch\"&gt;Hero of Kvatch&lt;/a&gt; may have gained entrance into the Dark Brotherhood by committing the murder of an innocent, and sleeping in any isolated room or location that the Dark Brotherhood deems 'safe'. When they awoke, Lucien Lachance confronted the Hero, with the offer of the \"honor\" of becoming a member of the Dark Brotherhood after completing a test which involved murdering &lt;a href=\"Rufio\"&gt;Rufio&lt;/a&gt;, who resided at the &lt;a href=\"Inn%20of%20Ill%20Omen\"&gt;Inn of Ill Omen&lt;/a&gt;, north of the town of &lt;a href=\"Bravil\"&gt;Bravil&lt;/a&gt;.\nLachance resided at Fort Farragut, an abandoned ruin of a fort located northeast of &lt;a href=\"Cheydinhal\"&gt;Cheydinhal&lt;/a&gt;. The Hero may have visited the fort in order to find out what Lucien had been planning and to also receive &lt;a href=\"Shadowmere\"&gt;Shadowmere&lt;/a&gt; as a reward.\nDeath.\nAfter learning of the deaths of various Black Hand members, Lachance deduced correctly that &lt;a href=\"Ungolim\"&gt;Ungolim&lt;/a&gt;, the Listener of the Black Hand, was the next target, and set out to stop his renegade Silencer from destroying the Dark Brotherhood completely. Lachance arrived in &lt;a href=\"Bravil\"&gt;Bravil&lt;/a&gt; too late. Ungolim lay dead at the foot of the Lucky Old Lady. Lachance angrily confronted his Silencer, and demanded to know why they had betrayed him and the Brotherhood. After seeing the confusion in the Silencer's eyes however, Lucien realized he was mistaken. The Silencer had been tricked into serving &lt;a href=\"Mathieu%20Bellamont\"&gt;the real traitor&lt;/a&gt;, who had not died in the Purification of the Cheydinhal Sanctuary, but continued to wreak havoc on the Brotherhood by replacing Lachance's dead drops. Lachance ordered his Silencer to travel to &lt;a href=\"Anvil\"&gt;Anvil&lt;/a&gt; at once, and lie in wait for the real traitor.\nUnfortunately, the Black Hand believed it was Lachance himself who was the traitor, and had ordered his execution. Lachance made his way to &lt;a href=\"Applewatch\"&gt;Applewatch&lt;/a&gt; farm, where he was greeted by the Black Hand. He desperately pleaded his innocence, but the Hand would not listen as they set about killing and mutilating his corpse beyond recognition. At one point during the slaughter, Speaker &lt;a href=\"Arquen\"&gt;Arquen&lt;/a&gt; was said to have feasted on Lachance's entrails.

The Sanctuary in Cheydinhal that had been in his care for many years was entrusted to Arquen, who showed remorse for her part in Lachance's murder, though took solace in the fact that he now serves the Dread Father in the Void.\nIn &lt;a href=\"4E%20201\"&gt;4E 201&lt;/a&gt;, Lucien served as a &lt;a href=\"Spectral%20Assassin%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Spectral Assassin&lt;/a&gt;, continuing to serve the Brotherhood.

He is the very first contact and recruiter for the &lt;a href=\"Hero%20of%20Kvatch\"&gt;Hero of Kvatch&lt;/a&gt; into the Dark Brotherhood. For much of the duration of the Dark Brotherhood questline, he is the Speaker overseeing the Hero. His only formal residence is &lt;a href=\"Fort%20Farragut\"&gt;Fort Farragut&lt;/a&gt;, which is located east of &lt;a href=\"Cheydinhal%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;Cheydinhal&lt;/a&gt;.\nBackground.\nHistory.\nLachance is known to have visited &lt;a href=\"Skyrim\"&gt;Skyrim&lt;/a&gt; in his youth. He once stole the eyes of a thief in &lt;a href=\"Riften\"&gt;Riften&lt;/a&gt; in retaliation for the thief stealing his purse.\nAt some point, Lachance joined the &lt;a href=\"Dark%20Brotherhood%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;Dark Brotherhood&lt;/a&gt;, an assassin's guild. When the Speaker of the Cheydinhal Sanctuary died fulfilling a contract, Lachance was promoted to replace them. Shortly afterwards, Lachance began the task of raising and training &lt;a href=\"Ocheeva\"&gt;Ocheeva&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Teinaava\"&gt;Teinaava&lt;/a&gt; in the way of the &lt;a href=\"Shadowscale\"&gt;Shadowscale&lt;/a&gt;. He later appointed Ocheeva as nominal head of Cheydinhal Sanctuary due to his long absences.\nLachance was responsible for recruiting &lt;a href=\"Antoinetta%20Marie\"&gt;Antoinetta Marie&lt;/a&gt;, having found her \"in the gutter\" and near death. He also recruited &lt;a href=\"Telaendril\"&gt;Telaendril&lt;/a&gt;, after she managed to kill her father in retaliation for putting a contract on her.\nLachance was said to have brutally murdered an assassin for breaking a tenant, an incident witnessed and recounted by &lt;a href=\"Gogron%20gro-Bolmog\"&gt;Gogron gro-Bolmog&lt;/a&gt;. One of Lachance's known contracts was the murder of &lt;a href=\"Mathieu%20Bellamont%27s%20mother\"&gt;a woman&lt;/a&gt; at the behest of her husband.\nWhen an unidentified Speaker began searching for a replacement for their dead Silencer, Lachance personally recommended &lt;a href=\"Mathieu%20Bellamont\"&gt;Mathieu Bellamont&lt;/a&gt; to the position.\nThird Era.\n&lt;a href=\"The%20Night%20Mother\"&gt;The Night Mother&lt;/a&gt; tasked Lachance with recruiting the &lt;a href=\"Hero%20of%20Kvatch\"&gt;Hero of Kvatch&lt;/a&gt; after they murdered an innocent. Once the Hero sleeps in any location Lachance deems secure, he pays them a visit and offers them a &lt;a href=\"Blade%20of%20Woe%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;Blade of Woe&lt;/a&gt;, along with an opportunity to join the Dark Brotherhood by killing a man named &lt;a href=\"Rufio\"&gt;Rufio&lt;/a&gt; at the &lt;a href=\"Inn%20of%20Ill%20Omen\"&gt;Inn of Ill Omen&lt;/a&gt;.\nOnce the Hero completes the task, Lachance pays them a second visit and directs them to Cheydinhal Sanctuary. When the Hero receives a contract about helping &lt;a href=\"Francois%20Motierre\"&gt;Francois Motierre&lt;/a&gt; fake his death, Lachance personally murders Francois' mother since the Dark Brotherhood refuses to assist Francois without at least one death.\nWhen the &lt;a href=\"Black%20Hand\"&gt;Black Hand&lt;/a&gt; declares a traitor is likely among the members of Cheydinhal Sanctuary, Lachance requests the Hero - the only one deemed innocent - to &lt;a href=\"Fort%20Farragut\"&gt;Fort Farragut&lt;/a&gt; and orders them to perform a Purification on the Sanctuary, killing everyone inside. He gives them a scroll to &lt;a href=\"Summon%20Rufio%27s%20Ghost\"&gt;summon the ghost of Rufio&lt;/a&gt; and a &lt;a href=\"poisoned%20apple\"&gt;poisoned apple&lt;/a&gt; to assist in this task.\nAfter the Purification is complete, Lachance promotes the Hero to his personal Silencer, replacing his previous one after they died during a contract. He also rewards the Hero with his personal steed, &lt;a href=\"Shadowmere%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;Shadowmere&lt;/a&gt;. From then onward, Lachance intends to give the Hero contracts through a series of &lt;a href=\"Dead%20Drop%20Orders\"&gt;dead drops&lt;/a&gt;.\nDeath.\nAfter learning of the deaths of various Black Hand members, Lachance deduced correctly that &lt;a href=\"Ungolim\"&gt;Ungolim&lt;/a&gt;, the Listener of the Black Hand, was the next target, and set out to stop his renegade Silencer from destroying the Dark Brotherhood completely. Lachance arrived in &lt;a href=\"Bravil%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;Bravil&lt;/a&gt; too late. Ungolim lay dead at the foot of the Lucky Old Lady.

Lachance ordered his Silencer to travel to &lt;a href=\"Anvil%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;Anvil&lt;/a&gt; at once, and lie in wait for the real traitor.\nUnfortunately, the Black Hand believed it was Lachance himself who was the traitor, and had begun hunting him day and night and keeping watch of his home. Lachance made his way to &lt;a href=\"Applewatch%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;Applewatch&lt;/a&gt; farm, hoping it to be a suitable hiding place while waiting for his Silencer to return.\nHowever, four members of the Black Hand arrived first. Lachance desperately pleaded his innocence, but the Black Hand would not listen as they set about killing and mutilating his corpse beyond recognition. At one point during the slaughter, Speaker &lt;a href=\"Arquen\"&gt;Arquen&lt;/a&gt; was said to have feasted on Lachance's entrails. Lachance's naked, mutilated corpse was then strung from the ceiling of the farmhouse, as a reminder to all who would betray the Dark Brotherhood.\nWhen Lachance's Silencer finally arrived, Arquen promoted them as the new Speaker in Lachance's stead and gifted them with Lachance's Black Hand robes.\nLegacy.\nLachance was remembered by the &lt;a href=\"Night%20Mother\"&gt;Night Mother&lt;/a&gt; as a loyal child of Sithis, and the epitome of everything the Dark Brotherhood represents. The Sanctuary in Cheydinhal that had been in his care for many years was entrusted to Arquen, who showed remorse for her part in Lachance's murder, though took solace in the fact that he now serves the Dread Father in the Void.\nLachance appears in as the &lt;a href=\"Spectral%20Assassin%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Spectral Assassin&lt;/a&gt;, continuing to serve the Dark Brotherhood. To acquire &lt;a href=\"Spectral%20Assassin%20%28Power%29\"&gt;the power&lt;/a&gt;, the Last Dragonborn must complete the quest \"&lt;a href=\"Bound%20Until%20Death\"&gt;Bound Until Death&lt;/a&gt;.\"\nInteractions.\n&lt;a href=\"A%20Knife%20in%20the%20Dark\"&gt;A Knife in the Dark&lt;/a&gt;.\nAfter murdering an innocent, the Hero is invited by Lachance to join the Dark Brotherhood if they can pass a test first; the Hero must kill Rufio in the Inn of Ill Omen. After doing so, he reveals the location of the &lt;a href=\"Dark%20Brotherhood%20Sanctuary%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;Dark Brotherhood Sanctuary&lt;/a&gt; in Cheydinhal to complete their entry within the Dark Brotherhood.\n&lt;a href=\"The%20Purification\"&gt;The Purification&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe Hero is summoned to Fort Farragut where Lachance orders them to eliminate all Dark Brotherhood members in an effort to rid the Sanctuary of a possible traitor.\n&lt;a href=\"A%20Kiss%20Before%20Dying\"&gt;A Kiss Before Dying&lt;/a&gt;.\nLachance confronts the Hero in &lt;a href=\"Bravil\"&gt;Bravil&lt;/a&gt; just after they had murdered &lt;a href=\"Ungolim\"&gt;Ungolim&lt;/a&gt;. Lachance reveals the Hero had been following false orders and unwittingly killing off members of the Black Hand. He orders the Hero to uncover who is behind the false orders.\n&lt;a href=\"Following%20a%20Lead\"&gt;Following a Lead&lt;/a&gt;.\nLachance is found by the surviving Black Hand at Applewatch farm and murdered.

It was too late for Lord Faleria to cancel the ritual, and the darkness he summoned inadvertently killed Lucina. Lord Faleria buried her with her brother &lt;a href=\"Ianus%20Faleria\"&gt;Ianus&lt;/a&gt; on the surface, where he never allowed his children to go, writing \"Let the Weeping Cease\" on her &lt;a href=\"Epitaph%20for%20Lucina%20Faleria\"&gt;epitaph&lt;/a&gt;."}

As a result it is very rare to see even a x 2 multiplier which makes this atribute the hardest to increase. While Luck generally does not affect the quality or quantity of results when using skills, it does affect the chance of success when attempting skill-related tasks, including: casting a &lt;a href=\"Spells%20%28Morrowind%29\"&gt;spell&lt;/a&gt;, crafting a &lt;a href=\"Potions%20%28Morrowind%29\"&gt;potion&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Enchant%20%28Morrowind%29\"&gt;enchanting&lt;/a&gt; an item, &lt;a href=\"Security%20%28Morrowind%29\"&gt;lockpicking&lt;/a&gt;, negotiating a price with a &lt;a href=\"Merchants%20%28Morrowind%29\"&gt;merchant&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Armorer%20%28Morrowind%29\"&gt;repairing&lt;/a&gt; items, and &lt;a href=\"Sneak%20%28Morrowind%29\"&gt;sneaking&lt;/a&gt; without being detected.\nCombat.\nIn combat Luck affects the chance of evading an enemy's attack, &lt;a href=\"Block%20%28Morrowind%29\"&gt;blocking&lt;/a&gt; if equipped with a &lt;a href=\"Shields%20%28Morrowind%29\"&gt;shield&lt;/a&gt;, and hitting a target with a &lt;a href=\"Weapons%20%28Morrowind%29\"&gt;weapon&lt;/a&gt; or spell. It is not a factor in reducing &lt;a href=\"Damage%20%28Morrowind%29\"&gt;damage&lt;/a&gt; occurred from attacks upon being hit.\nComparison to other Elder Scrolls games.\nUnlike \"\" predecessor , Luck does not affect the quality of &lt;a href=\"Random%20Loot%20%28Morrowind%29\"&gt;random loot&lt;/a&gt; found during gameplay. Although Luck is generally regarded as being less predominant to gameplay in \"Morrowind\" than in its successor, , it should be raised to a minimum of 50 to avoid being at a disadvantage in terms of the chance of success when using skills.\nCharacters.\nLuck is a unique attribute in \"Morrowind\" by being equal for all characters at the beginning of the game, regardless of &lt;a href=\"Races%20%28Morrowind%29\"&gt;race&lt;/a&gt; or gender. All characters start with 40 Luck. None of the &lt;a href=\"Birthsigns%20%28Morrowind%29\"&gt;birthsigns&lt;/a&gt; provide a bonus to this attribute, and no &lt;a href=\"Classes%20%28Morrowind%29\"&gt;classes&lt;/a&gt; receive a bonus to Luck. However, it is possible to create a character with a custom class and select Luck as a favored attribute to begin the game with 50.\nItems.\nLuck is one of three factors in determining the charge cost of using &lt;a href=\"enchanted%20item\"&gt;enchanted item&lt;/a&gt;s, along with the &lt;a href=\"Enchant%20%28Morrowind%29\"&gt;Enchant&lt;/a&gt; skill and &lt;a href=\"Intelligence%20%28Morrowind%29\"&gt;Intelligence&lt;/a&gt; attribute. By increasing these factors, enchanted items can be used more often before needing to be recharged.\nThe following items increase, lower, or restore Luck. \n\"Note: &lt;a href=\"Damage%20%28Morrowind%29\"&gt;Damage&lt;/a&gt; effects persist until &lt;a href=\"restore\"&gt;restore&lt;/a&gt;d; &lt;a href=\"Drain%20%28Morrowind%29\"&gt;Drain&lt;/a&gt; effects are temporary; &lt;a href=\"Constant%20Effect\"&gt;Constant&lt;/a&gt; effects cannot be &lt;a href=\"Dispel%20%28Morrowind%29\"&gt;dispelled&lt;/a&gt;.\"\n&lt;a href=\"Armor%20%28Morrowind%29\"&gt;Armor&lt;/a&gt;.\nThere is only one piece of armor that affects luck in \"Morrowind\", the expansion packs, and official &lt;a href=\"Official%20Plug-ins%20%28Morrowind%29\"&gt;plug-in&lt;/a&gt;. It was added to the game in the \"&lt;a href=\"Siege%20at%20Firemoth%20%28Plug-in%29\"&gt;Siege at Firemoth&lt;/a&gt;\" plug-in."}

Because of this, luck will never receive a multiplier when the player gains a &lt;a href=\"Character%20Level\"&gt;level&lt;/a&gt;.\nLuck plays a part in other aspects of the game, as well. For example:\nMathematical information.\nLuck affects a skill's overall performance. When one's luck is greater than 50, it adds a bonus to all skills. If luck is less than 50, it adds a penalty to all skills. The formula for the bonus or penalty is:\nThe following table lists the effects of increasing and decreasing luck on a generic skill of level 50:\nIn short, Luck's effect varies from -20 (Luck = 0) to +20 (Luck = 100), or +4 skill for every 10 points of Luck. Since the base value of luck is 50, the only time there will be a penalty is when luck is being lowered by a &lt;a href=\"Drain%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;Drain Attribute: Luck&lt;/a&gt; spell.\nLuck continues to provide a benefit if it goes over 100, up to a maximum value of 300. Theoretically, this would give each &lt;a href=\"Skills%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;skill&lt;/a&gt; a bonus of 120; however, the only two skills that actually continue to affect gameplay over 100, namely &lt;a href=\"Athletics%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;Athletics&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Acrobatics%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;Acrobatics&lt;/a&gt;, are not affected by the Luck algorithm in any way."}

The sculpture has existed for thousands of years, but its artist and the date of its creation are unknown.\nLegend.\nThe woman whose likeness the statue aims to replicate was said to live in the &lt;a href=\"First%20Era\"&gt;First Era&lt;/a&gt;. Born to a prostitute and an unknown man, she lived impoverished for most of her life, ridiculed by children because she did not know who her father was. Every day, she returned to her home, in tears from the bullying until a traveling Priest of &lt;a href=\"Stendarr\"&gt;Stendarr&lt;/a&gt; approached her one day. She told the man her story, to which he replied, \"You have kind eyes and a mouth that tells no lies. You are clearly a child of Stendarr, the God of Mercy, Charity, and Well-Earned &lt;a href=\"Luck%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;Luck&lt;/a&gt;.\" After this, when children asked of her father's identity, she responded with, \"I am a child of Luck.\"\nRenowned for her kindness, the woman grew up to be a barmaid in a local tavern. One night, she aided a man in rags who needed a place to sleep for the night. Much later, the man returned to Bravil, revealing himself as an &lt;a href=\"Imperial\"&gt;Imperial&lt;/a&gt; prince. He showered the woman in riches and gold for her kindness. The woman shared the wealth with all the citizens of Bravil and stayed in the city the rest of her life, living contentedly into her old age. Travelers come to the statue, hoping some of the lady's luck will rub off on them.\nConnections to the Night Mother.\nBeneath the statue resides a &lt;a href=\"Crypt%20of%20the%20Night%20Mother\"&gt;crypt&lt;/a&gt; for one woman and five children. The remains belong to the &lt;a href=\"Night%20Mother\"&gt;Night Mother&lt;/a&gt;, the unholy matron of the &lt;a href=\"Dark%20Brotherhood%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;Dark Brotherhood&lt;/a&gt;. Because of this, some have claimed that she and the Lucky Old Lady were the same person. However, sources claim the Night Mother lived during the &lt;a href=\"Second%20Era\"&gt;Second Era&lt;/a&gt;, serving as both a member of the &lt;a href=\"Thieves%20Guild%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;Thieves Guild&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Morag%20Tong\"&gt;Morag Tong&lt;/a&gt;.\nActive effects.\nActivating the statue bestows the ability \"Old Lady's Luck,\" which &lt;a href=\"Fortify%20Attribute%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;fortifies&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Luck%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;Luck&lt;/a&gt; by 10 points for 1,000 seconds. The statue also plays a part at the end of the &lt;a href=\"Dark%20Brotherhood%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;Dark Brotherhood&lt;/a&gt; quests, specifically \"&lt;a href=\"Honor%20Thy%20Mother\"&gt;Honor Thy Mother&lt;/a&gt;\" and \"&lt;a href=\"Whispers%20of%20Death\"&gt;Whispers of Death&lt;/a&gt;.\" Once these quests are completed, the effect can no longer be gained.\nRole in history.\n&lt;a href=\"Third%20Era\"&gt;Third Era&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Hero%20of%20Kvatch\"&gt;Hero&lt;/a&gt; might have killed the Night Mother's &lt;a href=\"Listener\"&gt;Listener&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Ungolim\"&gt;Ungolim&lt;/a&gt; \u2014 who stood near the statue every night to hear the Night Mother's words \u2014 at the statue when &lt;a href=\"Speaker\"&gt;Speaker&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Mathieu%20Bellamont\"&gt;Mathieu Bellamont&lt;/a&gt; tricked them by replacing the &lt;a href=\"Dead%20Drop%20Orders\"&gt;Dead Drop Orders&lt;/a&gt;. After the event, &lt;a href=\"Arquen\"&gt;Arquen&lt;/a&gt; and the other members of the &lt;a href=\"Black%20Hand\"&gt;Black Hand&lt;/a&gt; may have entered the crypt to seek the Night Mother's council, where Bellamont was revealed for the traitor he was and killed.\nIf the Hero of Kvatch became the Night Mother's Listener at this point, they received contracts from her and payment of 200 when they were reported to Arquen.\n&lt;a href=\"Fourth%20Era\"&gt;Fourth Era&lt;/a&gt;.\nDuring the Fourth Era, the war of control between two major &lt;a href=\"skooma\"&gt;skooma&lt;/a&gt; traffickers in Bravil brought about the destruction of the Lucky Old Lady's statue. During this event the Night Mother's crypt was looted and her body was moved to the &lt;a href=\"Cheydinhal%20Sanctuary\"&gt;Cheydinhal Sanctuary&lt;/a&gt;."}

Lurkers will also appear when the &lt;a href=\"Last%20Dragonborn\"&gt;Dragonborn&lt;/a&gt; cleanses the stones that have been corrupted by Miraak by using the &lt;a href=\"Bend%20Will\"&gt;Bend Will&lt;/a&gt;\u00a0shout on them. This is obtained by doing the quests \"&lt;a href=\"The%20Fate%20of%20the%20Skaal\"&gt;The Fate of the Skaal&lt;/a&gt;\" and \"&lt;a href=\"Cleansing%20the%20Stones\"&gt;Cleansing the Stones&lt;/a&gt;\"\u00a0during the questline.\nLoot.\nLurkers usually carry leveled gold and enchanted jewelry. Often they carry a unit or two of &lt;a href=\"Netch%20Leather%20%28Dragonborn%29\"&gt;netch leather&lt;/a&gt; and may also drop &lt;a href=\"slaughterfish%20egg\"&gt;slaughterfish egg&lt;/a&gt;s.\nCombat.\nA Lurker's melee attacks consist of swipes with its claws and the use of their large legs for stomping attacks, which can stagger opponents. It also causes a mass of poisonous, writhing tentacles to appear at the base of its foot. The poison damage is equivalent to that of the effect &lt;a href=\"Lingering%20Damage%20Health\"&gt;Lingering Damage Health&lt;/a&gt;. They can extend tentacles from their mouths for an attack called \"Lurker Spray\" which causes 8 points of damage. They also have a ranged attack called \"Acid Spit\" which deals between 10 and 20 points of damage over 5 seconds. Some of their attack animations are similar to giants.\nBecause Lurkers and &lt;a href=\"Giant%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;giants&lt;/a&gt; share some attacks, the tactics remain the same, by and large. &lt;a href=\"Frost%20Damage%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Frost&lt;/a&gt; spells can slow them down. A &lt;a href=\"Flame%20Atronach%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Flame&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"Storm%20Atronach%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Storm Atronach&lt;/a&gt; can attack from a distance with relatively little fear of retaliation. Showering arrows from a distance before they close is also a viable strategy. Another viable strategy is to sprint behind them and attack with a powerful weapon before they can react; fire damage enchantments and &lt;a href=\"Volendrung%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Volendrung&lt;/a&gt; work very well for this."}

After all, the history of &lt;a href=\"Resdayn\"&gt;Resdayn&lt;/a&gt;, the ancient name of Morrowind, is rife with assassination, blood sacrifice, and religious zealotry, hallmarks of the order. It is commonly said that the Morag Tong then as now murdered for the glory of the &lt;a href=\"Daedra%20Prince\"&gt;Daedra Prince&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Mephala\"&gt;Mephala&lt;/a&gt;, but common assumptions are rarely completely accurate. It is my contention that the earliest form of the Tong additionally worshipped an even older and more malevolent deity than Mephala. As terrifying as that Prince of &lt;a href=\"Oblivion%20%28Realm%29\"&gt;Oblivion&lt;/a&gt; is, they had and have reverence for a far greater evil.\nWrits of assassination from the first era offer rare glimpses into the Morag Tong's earliest philosophy. They are as matter of fact as current day writs, but many contain snatches of poetry which have perplexed our scholars for hundreds of years. \"Lisping sibilant hisses,' 'Ether's sweet sway,' 'Rancid kiss of passing sin,' and other strange, almost insane insertions into the writs were codes for the name of the person to be assassinated, his or her location, and the time at which death was to come. They were also direct references to the divine spirit called &lt;a href=\"Sithis\"&gt;Sithis&lt;/a&gt;.\nEvidence of the Morag Tong's expertise in assassination seems scarcely necessary. The few instances of someone escaping a murder attempt by them are always remarkable and rare, proving that they were and are patient, capable murderers who use their tools well. A fragment of a letter found among the effects of a well-known armorer has been sealed in our vaults for some time. It was likely penned by an unknown Tong assassin ordering weapons for his order, and offers some illumination into what they looked for in their blades, as well the mention of &lt;a href=\"Vounoura\"&gt;Vounoura&lt;/a&gt;, the island where the Tong sent its agents in retirement \u2014\nI congratulate you on your artistry, and the balance and heft of your daggers. The knife blade is whisper thin, elegantly wrought, but inpractical[sic]. It must have a bolder edge, for arteries, when cut, have a tendencies to self seal, preventing adequate blood loss. I will be leaving Vounoura in two weeks time to inspect your new tools, hoping they will be more satisfactory.\nThe Morag Tong spread quietly throughout Tamriel in the early years of the second era, worshipping Mephala and Sithis with blood, as they had always done.\nWhen the Morag Tong assassinated the Emperor &lt;a href=\"Reman%20Cyrodiil%20III\"&gt;Reman&lt;/a&gt; in the year &lt;a href=\"1E%202920\"&gt;2920&lt;/a&gt; of the &lt;a href=\"First%20Era\"&gt;First Era&lt;/a&gt;, and his successor, &lt;a href=\"Potentate\"&gt;Potentate&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Versidue%20Shaie\"&gt;Versidae-Shae&lt;/a&gt; (sic) in the &lt;a href=\"2E%20324\"&gt;324th&lt;/a&gt; year of the &lt;a href=\"Second%20Era\"&gt;Second Era&lt;/a&gt;, the assassins so long in the shadows were suddenly thrust into the light. They had become brazen, drunk with murder, literally painting the words 'MORAG TONG' on the wall in the Potentate's blood.\nThe Morag Tong was instantly and unanimously outlawed in all corners of Tamriel, with the exception of its home province of Morrowind. There they continued to operate with the blessings of the Houses, apparently cutting off all contact with their satellite brothers to the west. There they continue their quasi-legal existence, accepting black writs and murdering with impunity.\nMost scholars believe that the birth of the Dark Brotherhood, the secular, murder-for- profit order of assassins, was as a result of a religious schism in the Morag Tong. Given the secrecy of both cults, it is difficult to difine the exact nature of it, but certain logical assumptions can be made.\nIn order to exist, the Morag Tong must have appealed to the highest power in Morrowind, which at that time, the Second Era, could only have been the &lt;a href=\"Tribunal\"&gt;Tribunal&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"Almalexia\"&gt;Almalexia&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Sotha%20Sil\"&gt;Sotha Sil&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Vivec\"&gt;Vivec&lt;/a&gt;. Mephala, whom the Tong worshipped with Sithis, was said to have been the Anticipation of Vivec. Is it not logical to assume that in exchange for toleration of their continued existence, the Tong would have ceased their worship of Mephala in exchange for the worship of Vivec?\nThe Morag Tong continues, as we know, to worship Sithis. The Dark Brotherhood is not considered a religious order by most, merely a secular organization, offering murder for gold. I have seen, however, proof positive in the form of writs to the Brotherhood that Sithis is still revered above all.\nSo where, the reader, asks, is the cause for the schism? How could a silent war have begun, when both groups are so close? Both assassin's guilds, after all, worship Sithis. And yet, a figure emerges from history who should give those with this assumption pause.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Night%20Mother\"&gt;Night Mother&lt;/a&gt;\nWho the Night Mother is, where she came from, what her functions are, no one knows. &lt;a href=\"Carlovac%20Townway\"&gt;Carlovac Townway&lt;/a&gt; in his generally well-researched historical book &lt;a href=\"2920%2C%20The%20Last%20Year%20of%20the%20First%20Era\"&gt;2920, The Last Year of the First Era&lt;/a&gt; tries to make her the leader of the Morag Tong. But she is never historically associated with the Tong, only the Dark Brotherhood.\nThe Night Mother, my dear friend, is Mephala. The Dark Brotherhood of the west, unfettered by the orders of the Tribunal, continue to worship Mephala. They may not call her by her name, but the daedra of murder, sex, and secrets is their leader still. And they did not, and still do not, to this day, forgive their brethren for casting her aside.\nThe cobbler who met his end in the second era, who saw no end in the war between the Brotherhood and the Tong, was correct. In the shadows of the Empire, the Brothers of Death remain locked in combat, and they will likely remain that way forever."}

It is found in eastern Morrowind, which is under control of &lt;a href=\"House%20Indoril\"&gt;House Indoril&lt;/a&gt;, and is one of the most important nine cities of the mainland. It is a beautiful city built in the Indoril style, composed of ornate buildings with blue tiled roofs. The Indoril fortress of &lt;a href=\"Bal%20Tereg\"&gt;Bal Tereg&lt;/a&gt; is found nearby. The city has taken its name from protecting the region from &lt;a href=\"Red%20Mountain\"&gt;Red Mountain&lt;/a&gt;, the volcano located on &lt;a href=\"Vvardenfell\"&gt;Vvardenfell&lt;/a&gt;. It is found in a dry area composed of arid plateaus, hoodoos, mesas, and high steppes.

The Indoril fortress of &lt;a href=\"Bal%20Tereg\"&gt;Bal Tereg&lt;/a&gt; is found in the vicinity, also along Ouada Gla'amnir. Several other settlements are located near Firewatch including the towns of &lt;a href=\"Tel%20Mora\"&gt;Tel Mora&lt;/a&gt; in the west, &lt;a href=\"Velothis%20Haven\"&gt;Velothis Haven&lt;/a&gt; to the east, &lt;a href=\"Tel%20Aedrin\"&gt;Tel Aedrin&lt;/a&gt; to the south, and the grand city of &lt;a href=\"Port%20Telvannis\"&gt;Port Telvannis&lt;/a&gt; to the northeast in the &lt;a href=\"Northeast%20Archipelago\"&gt;Northeast Archipelago&lt;/a&gt;. It has a dry climate filled with arid plateaus and mesas, and receives a lot of sunlight despite its northern location. The &lt;a href=\"Sea%20of%20Ghosts\"&gt;Sea of Ghosts&lt;/a&gt; is heavily populated with seafarers and Buccaneers making Firewatch home to the ruffians of the &lt;a href=\"Padomaic%20Ocean\"&gt;Padomaic Ocean&lt;/a&gt;. Though usually quite warm, in the winters these waters can freeze over and become quite dangerous, resulting in shipwrecks around the city. Firewatch is deep within the reaches of the &lt;a href=\"House%20Indoril\"&gt;House Indoril&lt;/a&gt; District, making the city affiliated with the Great House.\nHistory.\n&lt;a href=\"Third%20Era\"&gt;Third Era&lt;/a&gt;.\nDuring the &lt;a href=\"Imperial%20Simulacrum\"&gt;Imperial Simulacrum&lt;/a&gt; from &lt;a href=\"3E%20389\"&gt;3E 389&lt;/a&gt; to &lt;a href=\"3E%20399\"&gt;3E 399&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Emperor\"&gt;Emperor&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Uriel%20Septim%20VII\"&gt;Uriel Septim VII&lt;/a&gt; was imprisoned along with &lt;a href=\"Talin%20Warhaft\"&gt;Talin Warhaft&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;a href=\"Deadlands\"&gt;Deadlands&lt;/a&gt; by &lt;a href=\"Jagar%20Tharn\"&gt;Jagar Tharn&lt;/a&gt;. Tharn planned for months to capture the throne, and he was able to achieve so in ten years. Tharn had a powerful weapon called the &lt;a href=\"Staff%20of%20Chaos\"&gt;Staff of Chaos&lt;/a&gt;, and he split it into nine pieces and scattered them across Tamriel, the staff was the only thing keeping Uriel Septim and Warhaft in &lt;a href=\"Oblivion\"&gt;Oblivion&lt;/a&gt;. A warrior escaped his clutches and traveled all corners of Tamriel to retrieve the missing pieces. The hero was known as the &lt;a href=\"Eternal%20Champion\"&gt;Eternal Champion&lt;/a&gt;, and he assembled the staff and defeated Jagar Tharn at the &lt;a href=\"Imperial%20Palace\"&gt;Imperial Palace&lt;/a&gt;. The Eternal Champion had at one point visited the city in their quest to recover the pieces. The city of Firewatch was under the rule of &lt;a href=\"Queen%20Vaynth\"&gt;Queen Vaynth&lt;/a&gt;."}

There are twenty-two of them in &lt;a href=\"Highpoint%20Tower\"&gt;Highpoint Tower&lt;/a&gt;, for example, and some can be found in the ruins in the &lt;a href=\"Volkihar%20Dungeons\"&gt;Volkihar Dungeons&lt;/a&gt;. In the base game, firewood can be found in some inns and two pieces can be found in &lt;a href=\"Swindler%27s%20Den%20%28Cave%29\"&gt;Swindler's Den&lt;/a&gt;.\n&lt;a href=\"Followers%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Followers&lt;/a&gt; can be commanded to chop firewood and carry it. They can carry firewood beyond their maximum weight capacity if the Dragonborn continues to instruct them to chop the firewood."}
