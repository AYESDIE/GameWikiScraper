It was added with the official plugin of the &lt;a href=\"Master%20Index%20%28Plug-in%29\"&gt;same name&lt;/a&gt;.\nDetailed walkthrough.\nFor this Quest, one will need to talk to Folms at the Mages Guild in &lt;a href=\"Caldera%20%28Morrowind%29\"&gt;Caldera&lt;/a&gt; about the topic 'work.' This will then trigger his asking the Nerevarine to retrieve the 10 Propylon Indices for him. They are as follows:\nHlormaren.\nFirst, he will ask the Nerevarine to find the Propylon in the Stronghold of &lt;a href=\"Hlormaren%20%28Morrowind%29\"&gt;Hlormaren&lt;/a&gt;. It can be purchased off of &lt;a href=\"Irgola\"&gt;Irgola&lt;/a&gt; the pawnbroker, who is located in Caldera. He sells the Index for around 500 . On the other hand, it can be stolen from the counter behind him. Due to the very small space in the store, Irgola standing in the way, and a guard nearby, stealing the index using &lt;a href=\"Chameleon%20%28Morrowind%29\"&gt;chameleon&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Telekinesis%20%28Morrowind%29\"&gt;telekinesis&lt;/a&gt; can be easier than stealing using &lt;a href=\"Sneak%20%28Morrowind%29\"&gt;sneak&lt;/a&gt;.\nMarandus.\nThe next Index is for &lt;a href=\"Marandus%20%28Morrowind%29\"&gt;Marandus&lt;/a&gt;. It can be found in between two crates on the floor in the downstairs area St. Olms Temple in &lt;a href=\"Vivec%20City%20%28Morrowind%29\"&gt;Vivec City&lt;/a&gt;. Enter St. Olms at the plaza level, go through the temple and downstairs. Once downstairs, go straight ahead to the T-intersection, turn right and go straight to the next T. Turn right and it is on the floor between the two middle crates at the back end of the room. It is not owned by anyone, so no NPCs, nearby or otherwise will react when it is taken. It may be difficult to see and moving the Gamma Correction level in the options menu towards Light can improve visibility.\nFalasmaryon.\n&lt;a href=\"Falasmaryon\"&gt;Falasmaryon&lt;/a&gt;'s Index is next. It can be bought off of &lt;a href=\"Salen%20Ravel\"&gt;Salen Ravel&lt;/a&gt; for 500 , who can be found in the Shrine in &lt;a href=\"Maar%20Gan\"&gt;Maar Gan&lt;/a&gt;, although it can simply be taken from the offering plate on the Shrine.\nValanvaryon.\nThis Index can be found in the Wise Woman's Yurt in &lt;a href=\"Urshilaku%20Camp%20%28Morrowind%29\"&gt;Urshilaku Camp&lt;/a&gt;. It is located on a table inside. However, it is owned by &lt;a href=\"Nibani%20Maesa\"&gt;Nibani Maesa&lt;/a&gt;, who will sell it to the player for 25 . Otherwise, it can be stolen off of the table, but due to its cheapness and the consequences caused by angering her in relation to the main story, it is recommended to pay for it instead.\nIndoranyon.\n&lt;a href=\"Indoranyon%20%28Morrowind%29\"&gt;Indoranyon&lt;/a&gt;'s index is in &lt;a href=\"Tel%20Fyr%20%28Morrowind%29\"&gt;Tel Fyr&lt;/a&gt;, on a table next to &lt;a href=\"Divayth%20Fyr%20%28Morrowind%29\"&gt;Divayth Fyr&lt;/a&gt;. Despite Mirel's warning, no character owns the Index, so it can simply be picked up. Dialogue with Fyr indicates that the Nerevarine is welcome to take it.\nBerandas.\nThis Index is located in Baladas Demnevanni's chamber in &lt;a href=\"Arvs-Drelen%20%28Morrowind%29\"&gt;Arvs-Drelen&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Gnisis%20%28Morrowind%29\"&gt;Gnisis&lt;/a&gt;. It is on a high bookshelf inside, next to a book. Baladas will not mind if it is taken.\nAndasreth.\n&lt;a href=\"Andasreth\"&gt;Andasreth&lt;/a&gt;'s Index is found on a bookshelf in the Dome atop &lt;a href=\"Hlormaren%20%28Morrowind%29\"&gt;Hlormaren&lt;/a&gt;. There are two &lt;a href=\"Khajiit%20%28Morrowind%29\"&gt;Khajiit&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Slavery\"&gt;slaves&lt;/a&gt; in the room, however, neither will prevent the Nerevarine from taking the Index, despite saying things like, \"Stop, thief!\" and, \"Why, you!\" even if they have been freed.\nRotheran.\nThis one is being carried by &lt;a href=\"Rols%20Ienith\"&gt;Rols Ienith&lt;/a&gt;, who can be found in the Communal Hut at &lt;a href=\"Rotheran\"&gt;Rotheran&lt;/a&gt;. He is hostile when encountered and must be killed to obtain the index on his person.\nFalensarano.\n&lt;a href=\"Falensarano%20%28Morrowind%29\"&gt;Falensarano&lt;/a&gt;'s Index is located near a skeletal corpse high inside the Forgotten Galleries in the Shrine of &lt;a href=\"Maelkashishi%20%28Morrowind%29\"&gt;Maelkashishi&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe longer route is to enter the shrine and ignore &lt;a href=\"Bulfim%20gra-Shugarz\"&gt;Bulfim gra-Shugarz&lt;/a&gt;, who is not hostile and necessary for a &lt;a href=\"Tribunal%20Temple\"&gt;Temple&lt;/a&gt; quest. All other encounters in the shrine are hostiles. &lt;a href=\"Levitate%20%28Morrowind%29\"&gt;Levitate&lt;/a&gt; up through the center hole in the ceiling and exit into the Forgotten Galleries. Levitate up through the gallery to the third, topmost platform on the west side, which where the corpse, a &lt;a href=\"Daedric%20Bow\"&gt;Daedric Bow&lt;/a&gt;, several &lt;a href=\"Daedric%20Arrow%20%28Morrowind%29\"&gt;Daedric Arrow&lt;/a&gt;s and the index lie on the platform floor.\nAlternatively, levitate up to the top, eastern entrance of the shrine. Enter and levitate down and west to aforementioned platform.\nTelasero.\n&lt;a href=\"Telasero\"&gt;Telasero&lt;/a&gt;'s Index is located in Telesero itself, in a treasure trough on the lower level, stacked below a few other items. Fight through the &lt;a href=\"Ash%20Creatures\"&gt;Ash Creatures&lt;/a&gt; roaming the area and enter the room with two doors on each side and a shrine in the back. The index is in the trough on the right.\nOnce all 10 have been given to Folms Mirel, he will give the Nerevarine the &lt;a href=\"Master%20Index%20%28Item%29\"&gt;Master Index&lt;/a&gt;, which will allow them to fast travel back to the Caldera Mages Guild by using the Master Index on the a Propylon Index, which then gives the player the ability to visit any of the 10 Dunmer Strongholds via talking to him."}

To gain training, the &lt;a href=\"fame\"&gt;fame&lt;/a&gt; or infamy attribute must be at 20 or more. Fame and infamy are acquired by completing &lt;a href=\"Quests%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;quests&lt;/a&gt;.

The spell requires a level 75 Conjuration skill to perform and has a base &lt;a href=\"Magicka%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;Magicka&lt;/a&gt; cost of 87.

Collect and bring twenty &lt;a href=\"Bear%20Pelt%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;bear pelts&lt;/a&gt; to her to get training. There are a couple of ways to collect &lt;a href=\"Bear%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;bear&lt;/a&gt; pelts: If the Hero is level 7 or above, they can be purchased from general stores for 30 each. Bears drop them when killed, but they are much more difficult to locate.\n&lt;a href=\"Hand-to-Hand%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;Hand-to-Hand&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe master of Hand-to-Hand is an Imperial named &lt;a href=\"Helvius%20Cecia\"&gt;Helvius Cecia&lt;/a&gt;. Cecia resides in a house in the city of &lt;a href=\"Bruma%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;Bruma&lt;/a&gt;.

The Inn can be found directly north of the \"second i\" in Imperial City on the map and directly south of the \"H\" in \"The Heartlands.\"\nTo unlock master level training in Heavy Armor, take the 50 from Pranal and purchase four silver glasses and a pitcher. Then, deliver them to &lt;a href=\"Malene\"&gt;Malene&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href=\"Associate\"&gt;Associate&lt;/a&gt;s of the Mages Guild can easily acquire these items from any guild hall's pantry or dining room without paying.\n&lt;a href=\"Illusion%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;Illusion&lt;/a&gt;.\n&lt;a href=\"Martina%20Floria\"&gt;Martina Floria&lt;/a&gt; is the master Illusion trainer.

Floria wants ten &lt;a href=\"Welkynd%20Stone%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;Welkynd Stones&lt;/a&gt; before she trains. These can be found almost exclusively in &lt;a href=\"Ayleid%20Ruins%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;Ayleid Ruins&lt;/a&gt; \u2014 but not always in sufficient numbers to fulfill Floria's demands in one trip. The stones are most plentiful in the &lt;a href=\"Necromancer%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;necromancer&lt;/a&gt; lair, &lt;a href=\"Wendelbek%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;Wendelbek&lt;/a&gt;, between the northern headwaters of the &lt;a href=\"Panther%20River\"&gt;Panther River&lt;/a&gt;, where 58 are spread out over four levels.\n&lt;a href=\"Light%20Armor%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;Light Armor&lt;/a&gt;.\nSpeak with &lt;a href=\"J%27bari\"&gt;J'bari&lt;/a&gt;, who shares a &lt;a href=\"J%27Bari%27s%20House\"&gt;house&lt;/a&gt; in south-central &lt;a href=\"Leyawiin%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;Leyawiin&lt;/a&gt; with midlevel Acrobatics trainer Tsrava. J'Bari wants a new &lt;a href=\"Elven%20Cuirass\"&gt;Elven Cuirass&lt;/a&gt;. If the Hero is under level 15 (where &lt;a href=\"Elven%20Armor%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;Elven Armor&lt;/a&gt; starts to make an appearance) take one from &lt;a href=\"Azani%20Blackheart%20%28Character%29\"&gt;Azani Blackheart&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;a href=\"Fighters%20Guild%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;Fighters Guild&lt;/a&gt; quest of the same name. Otherwise, Elven Cuirasses can be purchased from most armor vendors.\n&lt;a href=\"Marksman%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;Marksman&lt;/a&gt;.\nAcquire a &lt;a href=\"disposition\"&gt;disposition&lt;/a&gt; of 80 or higher with a Marksman trainer. The Hero will then be directed to &lt;a href=\"Alawen\"&gt;Alawen&lt;/a&gt; at &lt;a href=\"Troll%20Candle%20Camp\"&gt;Troll Candle Camp&lt;/a&gt; east of Anvil. It's hard to find Alawen and hard to talk to her in the camp during the day, as she's probably off hunting. Visit her between 10pm and 4am where she should be &lt;a href=\"Beds%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;sleeping&lt;/a&gt;. Make sure to visit her with an &lt;a href=\"Elven%20Bow%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;Elven bow&lt;/a&gt;, otherwise she does not offer training. The bow is her price for training.\n&lt;a href=\"Mercantile%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;Mercantile&lt;/a&gt;.\nPalonirya, proprietor of &lt;a href=\"Divine%20Elegance\"&gt;Divine Elegance&lt;/a&gt; in the Imperial City, offers training if the Hero has at least 10,000 .\n&lt;a href=\"Mysticism%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;Mysticism&lt;/a&gt;.\nOnce the Mysticism skill level reaches 70, trainers direct the Hero toward &lt;a href=\"Dagail\"&gt;Dagail&lt;/a&gt; of the &lt;a href=\"Leyawiin%20Mages%20Guild\"&gt;Leyawiin Mages Guild&lt;/a&gt;. Close three &lt;a href=\"Oblivion%20Gate%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;Oblivion Gates&lt;/a&gt; and she provides master training. This quest can easily be completed during \"&lt;a href=\"Allies%20for%20Bruma\"&gt;Allies for Bruma&lt;/a&gt;\" in the &lt;a href=\"Main%20Quest%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;main quest&lt;/a&gt;.\n&lt;a href=\"Restoration%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;Restoration&lt;/a&gt;.\nTrainers refer to &lt;a href=\"Oleta\"&gt;Oleta&lt;/a&gt; at the &lt;a href=\"Chapel%20of%20Akatosh\"&gt;Chapel of Akatosh&lt;/a&gt; for master level training in Restoration. Unfortunately, the chapel has been partly destroyed by the &lt;a href=\"Daedra\"&gt;Daedra&lt;/a&gt; who have invaded &lt;a href=\"Kvatch%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;Kvatch&lt;/a&gt;. Rescuing the inhabitants, including &lt;a href=\"Martin%20Septim%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;Martin Septim&lt;/a&gt;, allows her to teach master level Restoration. The quest in the main storyline, \"&lt;a href=\"Find%20the%20Heir\"&gt;Find the Heir&lt;/a&gt;,\" must be completed to active Oleta's training.\n&lt;a href=\"Security%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;Security&lt;/a&gt;.\n&lt;a href=\"J%27baana\"&gt;J'baana&lt;/a&gt;, a &lt;a href=\"Khajiit%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;Khajiit&lt;/a&gt; that is \"imprisoned\" in the Imperial City, is the master level Security trainer. Fetch and deliver a note for &lt;a href=\"S%27Krivva\"&gt;S'Krivva&lt;/a&gt;. After, he becomes a master level trainer. J'baana may be found dead, in prison, or battling the &lt;a href=\"City%20Guard%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;guards&lt;/a&gt;.\n&lt;a href=\"Sneak%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;Sneak&lt;/a&gt;.\n&lt;a href=\"Marana%20Rian\"&gt;Marana Rian&lt;/a&gt; is the master level Sneak trainer.

To unlock her as a trainer, the Hero must &lt;a href=\"pickpocket\"&gt;pickpocket&lt;/a&gt; a coin from her. After, she only trains at night, walking around the Imperial City Arboretum around midnight.\n&lt;a href=\"Speechcraft%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;Speechcraft&lt;/a&gt;.\n&lt;a href=\"Tandilwe\"&gt;Tandilwe&lt;/a&gt; is the master Speechcraft trainer. During the day, she can be found in the &lt;a href=\"Temple%20of%20the%20One\"&gt;Temple of the One&lt;/a&gt; in the Temple District. She offers training after one &lt;a href=\"Beggars%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;beggar&lt;/a&gt; in each city is spoken to, with the exclusion of &lt;a href=\"Kvatch%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;Kvatch&lt;/a&gt;."}

For many years I had trained at the Temple, rising to study in more difficult and demanding classes taught by the wisest and most learned Masters of the Two-Moons Dance.\n\"&lt;a href=\"Gi%27Nanth\"&gt;Gi'Nanth&lt;/a&gt;, you will come to understand that the tempering of your body must attend the tempering of your mind, and there is a prescribed order of training we at the Temple have designed over the years in concordance with the way of &lt;a href=\"Riddle%27Thar\"&gt;Riddle'Thar&lt;/a&gt;.

We had never noticed him but in passing over the years, for he would enter the training chambers quietly, clean for a few minutes' time, and leave without saying a word. Not that we would have listened if he spoke, so enraptured were we in our exercises and lessons.\n\"When our last Master told some of us, myself included, that the time had come for us to leave the Temple or become teachers, there was a great festival of celebration. The &lt;a href=\"Mane\"&gt;Mane&lt;/a&gt; itself deigned to visit and observe our ceremony. As we were and are a Temple of philosophy and combat, there were contests of debate and competitions in the Temple's war arena, not only among the elite few, but open to all students.\n\"On the first day of the festival, I was examining the gladiatorial roster to see who I would fight with first, when I heard a conversation behind me: the servant speaking to the archpriest of the Temple. It was the first time I heard the Dunmer's voice, and the first time I heard his name.\n\"'I understand you wish to rejoin your people's struggle in &lt;a href=\"Morrowind\"&gt;Morrowind&lt;/a&gt;, Taren,' the archpriest was saying. 'I am sorry to hear it. You have been an institution here for many, many years, and you will be missed. If there's anything I can do for you, please name it.'\n\"'Thank you for your kindness,' the Dunmer replied. 'I do have a request, but I fear you would be loath to grant it. Ever since I first came to the Temple, I have been watching the students learn, and practiced myself when my duties allowed for it. I know I am but a servant here, but I would be honored if you would allow me to compete in the war arena.'\n\"I stifled back my gasp at the mer's impertinence, to even suggest that he would be worthy to fight with those of us who had trained so hard. To my surprise, the archpriest agreed, adding the name &lt;a href=\"Taren%20Omothan\"&gt;Taren Omathan&lt;/a&gt; to the roster at the beginners' level. I was eager to whisper the news to my fellow elite students, but my first bout was scheduled to begin in a few minutes' time.\n\"I fought eighteen competitions in a row, besting all. The crowd gathered in the arena knew of my prowess, and gave polite, unsurprised applause at the end of each fight. As much as I focused on my own battles, I could not help noticing that other competitions were receiving more and more attention in the arena. The spectators whispered among themselves, and more began drifting away to see something that was evidently more spectacular and unusual than my unbroken string of victories.\n\"One of the most important lessons we teach from the Two-Moons Dance is the lesson of rejecting one's vanity. I understood then the importance of achieving a personal synchronicity with one's body and mind, of rebuffing outside influences of no importance, but I admit I had not accepted the lesson in my heart. I knew I was good, but my pride was hurt.\n\"It came down to a contest of champions, and I was one of the two. When I saw who the other fighter would be, my mood turned from one of wounded dignity to complete disbelief. My adversary was the servant, Taren.\n\"It must be a joke, or some final philosophical test, I reasoned. Then I looked into the crowd, and saw anticipation of a great battle to come in every eye. We gave one another the sign of respect, I stiffly and he with great elegance and modesty. The fight began.\n\"Initially, I sought to end it quickly, still thinking that he was unworthy to be cleaning the arena, let alone fighting in it. In retrospect, I was being illogical, as I must have known he had bested as many students as I to had reach that final level. He offered simple counterblows to my attacks, and responded in kind. His style was expansive, encompassing sophisticated arcane foot play one moment and simple jabs and kicks the next. I tried assailments intended to dazzle, but his face never showed either fear or contempt of my abilities.\n\"The fight lasted for a long time. I don't recall when I realized I was destined to lose, but when it ended, I was not surprised with the outcome. With a sense of unusual and true modesty, I bowed to him. But I could not resist asking him as we left the arena to the sound of thunderous applause how he had so secretly grown to become a Master.\n\"'I never had a choice to rise in the Temple,' Taren replied. 'Every day, I cleaned the training chambers of the elite classes and then the beginners'. So you see, I never had the misfortune to forget those early mistakes, lessons, and techniques while observing and learning the ways of the Masters.'\n\"He left Torval early the next morning to return to his homeland, and I never saw him again, though I've heard people saw that he's become a priest and a teacher. I became a teacher as well, for children just beginning their training in the Two-Moons, as well as the elite. And I make certain to bring my best pupils to see the how the unlearned fight, so that they might never forget.\""}

To my surprise, the archpriest agreed, adding the name Taren Omathan to the roster at the beginners' level. I was eager to whisper the news to my fellow elite students, but my first bout was scheduled to begin in a few minutes' time.\n\"I fought eighteen competitions in a row, besting all. The crowd gathered in the arena knew of my prowess, and gave polite, unsurprised applause at the end of each fight. As much as I focused on my own battles, I could not help noticing that other competitions were receiving more and more attention in the arena. The spectators whispered among themselves, and more began drifting away to see something that was evidently more spectacular and unusual than my unbroken string of victories.\n\"One of the most important lessons we teach from the Two-Moons Dance is the lesson of rejecting one's vanity. I understood then the importance of achieving a personal synchronicity with one's body and mind, of rebuffing outside influences of no importance, but I admit I had not accepted the lesson in my heart. I knew I was good, but my pride was hurt.\n\"It came down to a contest of champions, and I was one of the two. When I saw who the other fighter would be, my mood turned from one of wounded dignity to complete disbelief. My adversary was the servant, Taren.\n\"It must be a joke, or some final philosophical test, I reasoned. Then I looked into the crowd, and saw anticipation of a great battle to come in every eye. We gave one another the sign of respect, I stiffly and he with great elegance and modesty. The fight began.\n\"Initially, I sought to end it quickly, still thinking that he was unworthy to be cleaning the arena, let alone fighting in it. In retrospect, I was being illogical, as I must have known he had bested as many students as I had to reach that final level. He offered simple counterblows to my attacks, and responded in kind. His style was expansive, encompassing sophisticated arcane foot play one moment and simple jabs and kicks the next. I tried assailments intended to dazzle, but his face never showed either fear or contempt of my abilities.\n\"The fight lasted for a long time. I don't recall when I realized I was destined to lose, but when it ended, I was not surprised with the outcome. With a sense of unusual and true modesty, I bowed to him. But I could not resist asking him as we left the arena to the sound of thunderous applause how he had so secretly grown to become a Master.\n\"'I never had a choice to rise in the Temple,' Taren replied. 'Every day, I cleaned the training chambers of the elite classes and then the beginners'. So you see, I never had the misfortune to forget those early mistakes, lessons, and techniques while observing and learning the ways of the Masters.'\n\"He left Torval early the next morning to return to his homeland, and I never saw him again, though I've heard people saw that he's become a priest and a teacher. I became a teacher as well, for children just beginning their training in the Two-Moons, as well as the elite. And I make certain to bring my best pupils to see the how the unlearned fight, so that they might never forget.\""}

If you talk to him, he will ask whether you wish to learn the ways of swordsmanship here, and direct you to his teacher &lt;a href=\"Disciple%20Tafa%20at-Makela\"&gt;Disciple Tafa at-Makela&lt;/a&gt;. Tafa will be through the door, in the southeast of the area. Speak with her about how you can prove yourself to the school, and she will accept you but will also mention that she senses danger but cannot tell from where it will come. She will tell you that the first lesson you must learn is one of history. For this, you must speak with the smith &lt;a href=\"Smith%20Nabeenam\"&gt;Nabeenam&lt;/a&gt; and answer his riddles. \nHead over to Nabeenam; the smithy is north of you. Nabeenam will tell you the following riddles:\n\"Greetings to you, student. What knowledge do you seek? A strategy to slay your opponents? The strength to protect your allies? The power to split a kingdom in two? These things you may do, and have done already. But these are not the arts I teach.\"\nIn the first riddle, the answer is that the man and the woman are both bandits. For the second one, the answer is that the warrior used a wooden training sword. For the third riddle, Nabeenam will tell you that just before his death, &lt;a href=\"Master%20Ahram%20Sesnit\"&gt;Master Ahram Sesnit&lt;/a&gt; asked his most favored student to give him what he desired most, so that she could become the new blademaster of Leki's Blade. For this one, you must question the servants at Leki's Blade to find the answer. \n&lt;a href=\"Unar\"&gt;Unar&lt;/a&gt; will tell you that the last that was known of the master was that he battled a group of bandits and then disappeared. &lt;a href=\"Halam\"&gt;Halam&lt;/a&gt; will tell you a phrase from the old master: \"We do not choose when we rest. To give up the hard road is to bring suffering to the next traveler.\" Finally, &lt;a href=\"Iman\"&gt;Iman&lt;/a&gt; will tell you that the master despised magic and would not even use enchanted weapons. \n\"If you want to discover what Master Ahram's favorite student gave him, you must speak with the servants of Leki's Blade.\"\nAfter speaking to all the servants, return to Nabeenam. The answer to his riddle is that the student asked the master to retrieve her blade from a group of bandits, giving the old man one last battle. You have now passed Nabeenam's test, and he will direct you to go speak with &lt;a href=\"Disciple%20Raifa%20af-Haba\"&gt;Disciple Raifa af-Haba&lt;/a&gt; to be tested in the art of battle. Raifa will be in the east of the area, in the dueling arena. He will agree with Tafa that danger is approaching, but also cannot tell from where. His test will be one of strength; you must face his students in battle. After you are done talking to him, you will be set upon by three of his students. Defeat them, then head to &lt;a href=\"Master%20Fadalia\"&gt;Master Fadalia&lt;/a&gt; in the central area. \nFor Fadalia's test, you must drink from the Cup of Visions next to her. This will put you into a slumber; in the dream world, your task is to collect Raifa's Sword, Nabeenam's Hammer and Tafa's Shield. The shield will be directly to your west; upon picking it up, you will be set upon by two Fallen Disciples. From this point onwards, &lt;a href=\"Bloodfiend\"&gt;Bloodfiend&lt;/a&gt;s will appear throughout the dream. Head northwest past the wall and you will find Nabeenam's hammer guarded by some enemies. Lastly, head to the northwest of the area to find Raina's Sword. Every time you pick up one of the items, you will hear a ghostly voice talking about some secret the Master is keeping.\nUnearthly Voice: \"This hallowed ground is cursed with our blood.\"\nUnearthly Voice: \"The master's secret must be revealed \u2026.\"\nUnearthly Voice: \"She hasn't the strength. You must be stronger.\"\nOnce you have all the items, you will return to the waking world. Head for the shrine northeast of the forge and pray at the shrines to show that you collected the items. After you have done this, enter the building and sit among the students. A conversation will occur between Master Fadalia and Master Ahram Sesnit, suggesting that he is a vampire. Speak with Fadalia and she will tell you that her old master has recently returned as a vampire, and that she has been giving him the lifeblood of the students, but that she will no longer do so. She will ask you to kill her old master, who rests beneath his monument here at Leki's Sword. She will also ask you to tell the other disciples what she has done, so that they can decide how to punish her.\nHead down the stairs from the shrine and speak with Tafa at-Makela. She will not believe what you will tell her, but Master Fadalia will then come down and confirm your story. After this, head to the east of the area, to the tombstone. Behind the tombstone, there will be an entrance to the crypt. Head in and slay Master Sesnit, then return above ground. You will see that an &lt;a href=\"Arbiter%20Salida%20at-Natedan\"&gt;Arbiter&lt;/a&gt; has just arrived to decide on Master Fadalia's punishment. Speak with disciples Tafa and Raifa about their thoughts, then speak with the arbiter and advise her on whether you think Fadalia should live or die. If you let her live, . If you choose for her death, Master Fadalia will accept the punishment and end her own life. Afterward, speak with Tafa to finish the quest. "}

The Wizard &lt;a href=\"Gabrielle%20Benele\"&gt;Gabrielle Benele&lt;/a&gt; asked the &lt;a href=\"Vestige\"&gt;Vestige&lt;/a&gt; to help her recharge the &lt;a href=\"Midnight%20Talisman\"&gt;Midnight Talisman&lt;/a&gt;. It could be a powerful weapon in the battle against &lt;a href=\"Angof%20the%20Gravesinger%20%28Character%29\"&gt;Angof the Gravesinger&lt;/a&gt;.\nWalkthrough.\nGabrielle Benele says she has a ritual that can recharge the talisman and restore its power. On the beach nearby is an ancient Wyrd site we can use and focus. She just needs to rest a little bit, she'll be at the site a little later. She gives the talisman to the Vestige and tells them meet her there.\nFollow the marker to the beach and the Wyrd site is on a small sandbank. Gabrielle is waiting under the magnificent tree. Talk to her and she'll explain she found an inscription in the crypt. It described the talisman in detail and apparently it can draw energy from the land itself. Ancient magic saturates this site, it's the perfect place to perform the ritual of recharging. The Vestige asks what happens now and Gabrielle just says she'll perform the ritual and they can just stand there and look heroic, simple?\nWhen ready, Gabrielle starts the ritual but something went wrong. Speak to her again to find out. She says the ritual worked but something...well, something awful looked at her while she was channeling her energy. Something seems to be trapped inside and it's not friendly. Try to dispel it using the Wyrd revelation stone in the circle just up the beach. Put the talisman on the stone and kill whatever emerges. She is sure it's just a &lt;a href=\"banekin\"&gt;banekin&lt;/a&gt; or a lesser &lt;a href=\"Scamp%20%28Online%29\"&gt;scamp&lt;/a&gt;. She is still tired after her injury so the Vestige has to do it alone.\nHead over to the revelation stone and put the talisman on top of it. At once a &lt;a href=\"Dremora%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Dremora&lt;/a&gt; appears and he attacks the Vestige immediately. Fight and defeat him, then speak to Gabrielle who managed to follow them to the site.\nShe is very sorry she was wrong about how powerful the thing in the talisman was. At least it's gone now and they can use the talisman now. She has enough energy to open a portal for both of them to use and asks the Vestige if they are ready to go back to the Redoubt.\nWhen back at the Redoubt speak to Gabrielle again and she says they're ready to confront Angof and destroy him. He won't be able to hide from them now. She told &lt;a href=\"Sir%20Lanis%20Shaldon\"&gt;Sir Lanis&lt;/a&gt; what happened out there. She suggests the Vestige introduce themselves to him when they get a chance."}

He is the primary antagonist in the &lt;a href=\"Dark%20Brotherhood%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;Dark Brotherhood&lt;/a&gt; quests. He is a long-serving member of the Dark Brotherhood, having joined the organization when he was a boy.\nBackground.\nMathieu Bellamont joined the family with the sole intention of destroying it as revenge for the murder of &lt;a href=\"Mathieu%20Bellamont%27s%20Mother\"&gt;his mother&lt;/a&gt; years earlier. His dark plans finally came to fruition when he was appointed to serve on the &lt;a href=\"Black%20Hand\"&gt;Black Hand&lt;/a&gt; as a Silencer. Using his position on the Black Hand, as well as the unknowing aid of &lt;a href=\"Hero%20of%20Kvatch\"&gt;a family member&lt;/a&gt;, Bellamont proceeded to wreak havoc on the Brotherhood, killing off one Black Hand member after another.\nEarly life.\nMathieu Bellamont was raised by his mother from birth, and the two apparently shared a very close bond. Bellamont's parents appeared to have separated, and his father, angered by this, contacted the Dark Brotherhood in order to exact his revenge.\nThe Night Mother heard his father's prayers and sent &lt;a href=\"Lucien%20Lachance%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;Lucien Lachance&lt;/a&gt; to fulfill the contract. The young Bellamont witnessed Lachance behead his mother from underneath his bed. The sight of his mother's severed head drove Bellamont insane. He swore that day that he would destroy the Night Mother, the Dark Brotherhood, and in particular Lachance.\nWelcome to the Family.\nConsumed by revenge, madness and grief, young Bellamont began forming an elaborate plan in order to exact his revenge. He began his vendetta with his father's \"beating heart,\" thus earning the attention of the Night Mother (who observed Bellamont's murder). Later that night Bellamont received a visit from none other than Lachance.\nUnaware of Bellamont's true identity and intentions, Lachance embraced him into the \"family\" like a brother. Bellamont was initiated as a murderer at the Cheydinhal Sanctuary where he quickly gained a reputation as one of the most ambitious family members the Brotherhood had ever produced.\nAt some point, Bellamont encountered the crew of &lt;a href=\"The%20Serpent%27s%20Wake\"&gt;The Serpent's Wake&lt;/a&gt;, who laughed at him and called him \"a human rat.\" Enraged, Bellamont boarded the ship at night and slit the throat of every last crew member, leading the ship to become haunted. Locals of Anvil began referring to The Serpent's Wake as \"&lt;a href=\"The%20Ghost%20Ship%20of%20Anvil\"&gt;The Ghost Ship of Anvil&lt;/a&gt;,\" much to Bellamont's amusement.\nWhen an unidentified Speaker lost their Silencer to a contract, they began searching for a replacement. Lachance recommended Bellamont to the position. Soon afterward, Bellamont began to cut a bloody swathe through the family, killing many. It was only when Blanchard was killed Bellamont made a mistake: he was caught fleeing the scene in Dark Brotherhood robes, leading the Black Hand to put out the word that the Brotherhood had been infiltrated.\nThe Black Hand.\nSome time later, Bellamont continued to kill unnoticed amongst the Brotherhood. When the &lt;a href=\"Hero%20of%20Kvatch\"&gt;Hero of Kvatch&lt;/a&gt; was named Lucien's Silencer, Bellamont decided to use this particularly ambitious family member for his own gains. He tracked Lachance down to one of his &lt;a href=\"Dead%20Drop%20Orders\"&gt;dead drops&lt;/a&gt; and began replacing the third one onwards, tricking the Hero - whom Bellamont called a \"fool\" \u2013 into killing members of the Black Hand, one by one.\nAs the Hero was Lachance's Silencer, the Black Hand began to suspect Lachance was the traitor. After writing the order for Arquen's death and sending &lt;a href=\"Enilroth\"&gt;Enilroth&lt;/a&gt; to place the contract in a barrel behind the mermaid statue in Anvil, he and the Black Hand tracked Lachance down to Applewatch Farm, where Bellamont, &lt;a href=\"Arquen\"&gt;Arquen&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Belisarius%20Arius\"&gt;Belisarius Arius&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Banus%20Alor\"&gt;Banus Alor&lt;/a&gt; tortured and murdered Lachance, just in time before the Hero arrived with &lt;a href=\"Traitor%27s%20Diary\"&gt;proof of his innocence&lt;/a&gt;.\nAfter Arquen promoted the Hero to Speaker, she led the Black Hand to Bravil in order to consult the Night Mother on the Black Hand's future. When the Night Mother claimed Lachance was not the traitor and the true traitor was still among them, Bellamont revealed himself and killed Arius and Alor. He proceeded to attack the Night Mother herself. However, the ethereal specter of the Brotherhood's matron could not be harmed by physical means. At last, the Black Hand saw its true enemy and the remaining two Speakers killed Bellamont, finally bringing an end to his rampage.\nPersonality.\nMathieu Bellamont was functionally insane. Witnessing the murder of his mother by Lachance severely unhinged him and filled his head with little beyond thoughts of vengeance, murder, and, on some occasions, suicide. However, he was very calculating and patient, having kept his plans for revenge very secret for so long, partly due to his disciplined training from the Brotherhood.\nBellamont kept a &lt;a href=\"Traitor%27s%20Diary\"&gt;diary&lt;/a&gt; from the beginning of his time with the Dark Brotherhood which he wrote using the blood of various victims, whose bodies he kept stored in his cellar home, along with his mother's head, which he talked to, and believed spoke back to him.\nIf his mother's head is taken from the &lt;a href=\"Anvil%20Lighthouse%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;Anvil Lighthouse&lt;/a&gt; basement in the quest \"&lt;a href=\"Following%20a%20Lead\"&gt;Following a Lead&lt;/a&gt;,\" then dropped on the ground in &lt;a href=\"Applewatch%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;Applewatch&lt;/a&gt;, Bellamont has some unique dialogue. Ultimately, he struggles to properly speak as he is distracted by the sight.\nBellamont despises the Dark Brotherhood and what it does. His ultimate goal was to 'kill' the Night Mother and destroy the Dark Brotherhood.

The sight of his mother's severed head drove Mathieu insane and he vowed revenge on the Dark Brotherhood, devising a complex and structured plan to bring it down, partly succeeding.\nBackground.\nAfter his mother's death, Mathieu killed his father who had prayed to the &lt;a href=\"Night%20Mother\"&gt;Night Mother&lt;/a&gt; for the death of his wife. Lachance took interest in him and invited him into the Brotherhood.\nBellamont carried his mother's head with him throughout the course of his plan, until he took up residence in the &lt;a href=\"Anvil%20Lighthouse%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;Anvil Lighthouse&lt;/a&gt; basement, where he set up a small shrine with candles and the head in the middle. It was in this same recluse that he brought the dead bodies of murdered Brotherhood members to be burnt.\nThe existence of the head and Mathieu's obsession with it was a secret that he only revealed to one person: an assassin named Maria. When Maria expressed disgust over it, Mathieu promptly killed her.\nInteractions.\n&lt;a href=\"Following%20a%20Lead\"&gt;Following a Lead&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Hero%20of%20Kvatch\"&gt;Hero of Kvatch&lt;/a&gt; discovers the head of Mathieu's mother in the basement of the Anvil Lighthouse.

He is involved in the quest &lt;a href=\"The%20Blessings%20of%20Nature\"&gt;The Blessings of Nature&lt;/a&gt;.\nInteractions.\nHe approaches the &lt;a href=\"Last%20Dragonborn\"&gt;Dragonborn&lt;/a&gt; after overhearing the conversation with Priestess &lt;a href=\"Danica%20Pure-Spring\"&gt;Danica Pure-Spring&lt;/a&gt; about going to the &lt;a href=\"Eldergleam%20Sanctuary\"&gt;Eldergleam Sanctuary&lt;/a&gt;. He asks to go along, but it is optional as to whether or not to allow it. He has no armor or weapons, cannot be told to \"wait\" before a fight, and can be killed. However, if taken along, he has a possible impact on the outcome of the quest. Upon witnessing the player's \"violence\" against the &lt;a href=\"Eldergleam%20Tree\"&gt;Eldergleam Tree&lt;/a&gt;'s roots with &lt;a href=\"Nettlebane\"&gt;Nettlebane&lt;/a&gt;, he offers a second option. Rather than take the sap from the tree forcefully, he prays to it and is given an &lt;a href=\"Eldergleam%20Sapling\"&gt;Eldergleam Sapling&lt;/a&gt;. This avoids having to fight the &lt;a href=\"Spriggan%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Spriggans&lt;/a&gt;.\nMultiple followers.\nMaurice is one of the quest characters that can be exploited to follow the Dragonborn throughout Skyrim along with another &lt;a href=\"Followers%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;follower&lt;/a&gt;. It should however be noted that while he will indeed follow and aid in fights, he cannot be commanded or equipped. He fights barehanded or with weapons he finds (he prefers greatswords), and can die in battle (as is the case with &lt;a href=\"Enmon\"&gt;Enmon&lt;/a&gt;). This can be avoided by 'reverse pickpocketing' him and placing tempered, enchanted armor, ring, necklace, and weapons (bows and arrows also), and atronach staves in his inventory. (Note: This can only be done before conversing with him in that he will approach and speak to the Dragonborn and therefore the player must press the exit conversation button to continue planting equipment on him, otherwise he is unable to be pickpocketed.)\nJust like Enmon, and &lt;a href=\"Brother%20Verulus\"&gt;Brother Verulus&lt;/a&gt;, Maurice can equip a set of any planted heavy armor that's not equipped on the chest (except that &lt;a href=\"Iron%20Armor%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Iron&lt;/a&gt; Chest Armor works) and so any Light Chest Armor can be planted on him. He will equip his weapon as soon as he finishes his dialogue, but he will only equip his armor after exiting the &lt;a href=\"Temple%20of%20Kynareth%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Temple of Kynareth&lt;/a&gt;. His health does not regenerate but he can be healed with &lt;a href=\"Healing%20Hands%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Healing Hands&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Heal%20Other\"&gt;Heal Other&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"Grand%20Healing%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Grand Healing&lt;/a&gt;. Without giving him enchanted gear that boosts his health, magicka, stamina, and their regens, this makes him one of the worst followers, more so than &lt;a href=\"Fjotra\"&gt;Fjotra&lt;/a&gt;, who cannot die due to being a child. A more tedious alternative would be to equip him with a weapon that has a high &lt;a href=\"Absorb%20Health%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Absorb Health enchantment&lt;/a&gt;.\nConversations.\nThe Gildergreen.\nMaurice: \"What is it... what has happened to the Gildergreen? I have traveled long here to worship beneath its branches.\"\nDanica: \"It was taken by a lightning strike. Wish I had time to deal with it, but it's hard enough with all these wounded from the war.\"\nMaurice: \"Please, don't just let it stay like this. It's disgraceful.\"\nDanica: \"I really don't have time to deal with you right now. Please just let me get back to my work.\"\nMaurice: \"But this is supposed to be your work.\""}

Despite this, or perhaps because of it, omens and prophesies abound in &lt;a href=\"Tamriel\"&gt;Tamriel&lt;/a&gt;, some of substance, others of pure folly, and still others so ambiguous as to be unverifiable. There are still other prophesies kept secret, from the prophesies of &lt;a href=\"Dro%27Jizad\"&gt;Dro'Jizad&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Elsweyr\"&gt;Elsweyr&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Nerevarine\"&gt;Nerevarine&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Morrowind\"&gt;Morrowind&lt;/a&gt;, to the &lt;a href=\"Elder%20Scroll%20%28Lore%29\"&gt;Elder Scrolls&lt;/a&gt; themselves.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Nord\"&gt;Nord&lt;/a&gt; nobility have a tradition of having omens read for their children. In general, these readings are of the obscure variety. One of my acquaintances told me that her parents were told, for example, that their daughter would have her life rescued by a snake, and so gave her the name Serpentkin in a special ceremony. And this young lady, Eria Valkor Serpentkin, was indeed saved by a snake many years later, when an assassin creeping on her stepped on a danswyrm viper.\nOccasionally, omens seem to be almost purposefully misleading, as if &lt;a href=\"Boethiah\"&gt;Boethiah&lt;/a&gt; had crafted them as traps. I recall one particularly. Many, many years ago, a male child was born into &lt;a href=\"House%20Redoran\"&gt;House Redoran&lt;/a&gt;. It was a very difficult birth, and the mother was delirious and near death by the time it was over. She chanted just as her son came into the world and she passed from it.\nThe boy, named Andas, was indeed extraordinary. He never was ill and never suffered so much as a scratch all through his childhood. He was also quite intelligent and strong, which, combined with his invulnerability, caused many to call him, after his mother's omen, the Hope of the Redoran. Of course, any one who is called the Hope of the Redoran will eventually develop some taint of impertinence, and it wasn't long before he had enemies.\nHis worst enemy was his cousin Athyn, who had borne much abuse at the hands of Andas. Primary among the grudges was that Athyn had been sent to Rihad to complete his education at Andas's insistence. When Athyn returned from &lt;a href=\"Hammerfell\"&gt;Hammerfell&lt;/a&gt;, it was because of the death of his father, who had also been a councilor of the House. Athyn was old enough to take his seat in the Council, but Andas claimed the seat as well, saying that his cousin had been gone too long from Morrowind and didn't understand politics as he did. The majority of the House agreed with Andas, wanting to see the Hope of Redoran rise quickly.\nAthyn exercised his right to combat his cousin for the seat. No one thought he had any chance of winning, of course, but the battle was scheduled to commence the following morn. Andas whored and dined and drank with the councilors that night, confident that his place in the House was secured and the hopeful new dawn of House Redoran was rising. Athyn retired to his castle with his friends, Andas's enemies, and his servants he had brought from &lt;a href=\"Hammerfell\"&gt;Hammerfell&lt;/a&gt;.\nAthyn and his friends were discussing the duel morosely when one of his old teachers, a warrior called Shardie, came into the hall. She had grown quite proud of her student over the years in Hammerfell, proud enough to accompany him across the Empire to his family's lands, and wanted to know why they had so little confidence in his odds in the battle. They explained to her Andas's uncommon blessings and the nature of his mother's omen.\n\u201cIf he can't be harmed by disease, poison, magicka, and his blood can never be spilled, what hope have I of ever besting him?\u201d cried Athyn.\n\u201cHave you remembered nothing I taught you?\u201d replied Shardie. \u201cIs there no weapon you can think of that will slay without blood? Are swords and spears and arrows the only items in your arsenal?\u201d\nAthyn quickly realized the weapon Shardie was speaking of, but it seemed absurd. Not only absurd, but pathetic and primitive. Still, it was the only hope he had. All that night, Shardie trained him in the art and techniques, showing him the various swings and stances her people had developed in ; counter-attacks, feints, and blocks imported from &lt;a href=\"Yokuda\"&gt;Yokuda&lt;/a&gt;; the classic one and two-handed grips for the most ancient weapon in history.\nThe cousins faced one another the next morning, and never have two combatants looked so unevenly matched. Andas's entrance brought a great cheer, for not only was he much beloved as the Hope of the Redoran, but as his victory was a foregone conclusion, most wanted to be in good standing with him. His shining mail and blade drew admiration and awe. By contrast, Athyn drew a gasp of surprise and only a smattering of polite applause. He appeared costumed and armed like a barbarian.\nAs Shardie had suggested, Athyn allowed Andas to attack first. The Hope of the Redoran was eager to finish the battle and take the power he deserved quickly. The blade pushed by Andas's mighty arm slashed across Athyn's chest, but shallowly, and before it could be counterswung, Athyn knocked it back with his own weapon. When Athyn attacked and wounded Andas, the Hope of the Redoran was so surprised by being hurt for the first time in his life, he dropped his sword.\nThe less said about the end of the battle, the better. Suffice it to say that Athyn, wielding a simple club, battered Andas to death without spilling a drop of blood.\nAthyn took his father's seat as councilor, and it was then said that the hope in the omen referred to Athyn, not Andas. After all, had Andas not tried to take the councilor seat away from his cousin, Athyn, being not very ambitious, might have never tried to get it. It can certainly be argued that way, I suppose."}

It awaits us in a Dragon's lair, nestled within a dormant volcano in Southern Elsweyr.\"\nWalkthrough.\nAfter completing \"&lt;a href=\"The%20Dragonguard%27s%20Legacy\"&gt;The Dragonguard's Legacy&lt;/a&gt;,\" &lt;a href=\"Sai%20Sahan%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Sai Sahan&lt;/a&gt; will take you to &lt;a href=\"Southern%20Elsweyr\"&gt;Southern Elsweyr&lt;/a&gt;.

Once you reach the &lt;a href=\"Khajiit%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Khajiiti&lt;/a&gt; ruin, head in and start exploring. You will find that this place has been used as a &lt;a href=\"Kwama%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Kwama&lt;/a&gt; mine, but has since been abandoned and left to the Kwama. While you are exploring, you will hear &lt;a href=\"Vahlokzin\"&gt;Vahlokzin&lt;/a&gt; taunt you and Sai. In the passage way north of the first room, you will encounter the skeletons of two Dragonguard warriors who failed to retrieve the horn; their cracked Dragonguard seal is evidence of their membership of the group. Several other Dragonguard skeletons will be found throughout the lair.\nOnce you reach the room in the west, the dragon will roar and awaken a swarm of Kwama, so you will have to fend those off. Once all the kwama are dead, head on through the door to the south and proceed to the next part of the ruins. You will find a drawbridge blocking your way; the pulleys to control it are on the pillars to your right and left. For a clue on how to use them, use your grappling bow to head up the ledge to your east and you will find &lt;a href=\"Final%20Letter%20of%20Sergeant%20Berarah\"&gt;a letter&lt;/a&gt; next to a skeleton. It will contain the riddle you need to solve to open the drawbridge:\n\"\"&lt;a href=\"Khenarthi\"&gt;Khenarthi&lt;/a&gt; flies overhead, &lt;a href=\"Alkosh\"&gt;Alkosh&lt;/a&gt; stands in glory. The &lt;a href=\"Mane\"&gt;Mane&lt;/a&gt; bows before their greatness.\"\"\nIf you bring this riddle to Sai Sahan, he will explain who Khenarthi, Alkosh and the Mane are. To solve the riddle, the pulleys with images featuring a bird must be raised all the way up high, those with an hourglass must be in the middle and those with a Khajiit must be at the bottom. Once the drawbridge is lowered, head on to reach the Horn. Take it ang give it to Sai. Once you do so, Vahlokzin will attack. He is quite strong and will occasionally fly away from the battlefield and summon a horde of Kwama to fight for him, so be prepared. Once he is dead, Sai will tell you to head back with him to the Valley of Blades.\nHead back to where you entered Southern Elsweyr and board the cart there to return to the valley, then speak with Kasura to tell her what has happened. After that, speak with Sai Sahan to finish the quest."}

Arriving to find it stolen, the Dragonborn must discover its whereabouts.\nWithin the tomb, a word for the &lt;a href=\"Dragon%20Shout\"&gt;Dragon Shout&lt;/a&gt; \"&lt;a href=\"Become%20Ethereal\"&gt;Become Ethereal&lt;/a&gt;\" can be learned. Obstacles in this location include &lt;a href=\"Draugr%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Draugr&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Frostbite%20Spider%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Frostbite Spiders&lt;/a&gt; and hostile &lt;a href=\"Mage%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Mages&lt;/a&gt;.\nBackground.\n\"After demonstrating my ability to learn the Words of Power and to Shout, the Greybeard Arngeir has sent me on a final trial - retrieving the Horn of Jurgen Windcaller from his tomb in Ustengrav, a burial mound in the marshes of Hjaalmarch.\"\nWalkthrough.\nFirst, &lt;a href=\"Travel%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;travel&lt;/a&gt; to Ustengrav, which is just northeast of &lt;a href=\"Morthal%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Morthal&lt;/a&gt;. Inside are Mages, &lt;a href=\"Necromancer%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Necromancers&lt;/a&gt;, Draugr, and &lt;a href=\"Conjurer%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Conjurers&lt;/a&gt; fighting each other. Expect the necromancers to use Conjuration spells to reanimate any corpses almost immediately, whether they spawned alive or dead first, and then deal with ash piles left behind if the corpses were already dead before being reanimated upon returning after the area respawns. There are four things of note in this tomb: a hard-to-reach room, a word of power for the \"Become Ethereal\" shout, a puzzle room, and a note.\nThe Shout.\nThe hard-to-reach room is in Ustengrav Depths. In there, the large pillars have collapsed paths along them. Find the rock closest to the first pillar and jump across to it. &lt;a href=\"Whirlwind%20Sprint\"&gt;Whirlwind Sprint&lt;/a&gt; is needed to reach the last two pillars. At the end is a room with a dead Draugr, a &lt;a href=\"Soul%20Gem%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Soul Gem&lt;/a&gt;, and a &lt;a href=\"Containers%20%28Skyrim%29%23Chest\"&gt;chest&lt;/a&gt;.\nThere is a waterfall back in the main cavern on the north side and a path that leads down to it. A &lt;a href=\"Word%20Walls%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Word Wall&lt;/a&gt; for the shout Become Ethereal is next to it. There is a &lt;a href=\"Leveled%20Creatures%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;level dependent&lt;/a&gt; Draugr slumbering in a small cave behind the waterfall itself, as well as a chest.\nThe puzzle room.\nThere is a puzzle room with three stones that activate three timed doors, use Whirlwind Sprint within distance of the two farthest stones and then immediately sprint through the gates. The stones are proximity sensitive, but only two of the three can be activated from one place, nor will a waiting follower keep them activated. Activate the two furthest from the gates. The third activates and opens its gate as it is passed using Whirlwind Sprint. The Dragonborn can &lt;a href=\"Sprinting\"&gt;sprint&lt;/a&gt; to the third stone and then use Whirlwind twice. Note that the acceleration due to sprinting is a factor of armor weight, so a more heavily armored Dragonborn may find it easier to disrobe first. Once all of the gates are passed, they remain open, allowing &lt;a href=\"Followers%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;followers&lt;/a&gt; to catch up unscathed.\nThe flaming floor.\nAfter going through the catacomb-like room, there is a room with a large number of pressure-triggered fire traps on the floor. The curved diamond shapes in the center of each tile are different shades of gray. The lighter tiles are safe to step on, while the darker ones will trigger flame traps. Another solution, aside from using Whirlwind Sprint, is to use the Become Ethereal shout, which will render the flames harmless for as long as the shout is in effect. The &lt;a href=\"Sneak%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Sneak&lt;/a&gt; perk, Light Foot, will also work for bypassing the trap. It is also possible to walk on the rocky sides rather than the pressure tiles for most of the trapped hall. Another solution is to shoot the tiles with a spell such as &lt;a href=\"Firebolt%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Firebolt&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"Ice%20Spike%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Ice Spike&lt;/a&gt;. Flames/Sparks, etc. do not work. The impact of a bolt or spike is enough to set off the trap if it is not a safe tile. Yet another way is look at the tiles, because the safe tiles have a light diamond in the middle and the traps have a dark diamond. Additionally, spell absorption will absorb the flames and protect the Dragonborn from harm (when it activates). After passing the pressure plates, there may be one or two regular &lt;a href=\"Frostbite%20Spider%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;frostbite spiders&lt;/a&gt; and one &lt;a href=\"Giant%20Frostbite%20Spider\"&gt;Giant Frostbite Spider&lt;/a&gt;. The pair of spiders can be lured onto the traps.\nAfter making it past the spiders and fire traps, there is a doorway blocked by spider webs, which can be cut with a sword. Behind is a wooden door, which leads to a gate activated by a chain. This leads to a room where four statues rise out of the water.\nThe Unfortunate News.\nUnfortunately, the horn has been stolen and replaced with a \"&lt;a href=\"Mysterious%20Note%20%28Delphine%29\"&gt;Mysterious Note&lt;/a&gt;\". The note is in the hand of the deceased Jurgen Windcaller, where the horn should be. The note must be actively taken and read, even though the quest system tells its contents when it announces that the objective to retrieve the Horn of Jurgen Windcaller failed.\nThe note sends the Dragonborn to the &lt;a href=\"Sleeping%20Giant%20Inn\"&gt;Sleeping Giant Inn&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Riverwood%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Riverwood&lt;/a&gt;. Talk to &lt;a href=\"Delphine%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Delphine&lt;/a&gt; and ask to rent the attic room. She will say that they do not have an attic room, but to take the room on the left. Go into the room. If Delphine does not immediately enter the room, sleep or wait for a few hours. Delphine will then be there. After the conversation, follow her and she will give the Dragonborn the horn. She will then ask that she be joined on a quest to prove the player is a Dragonborn. This begins the \"&lt;a href=\"A%20Blade%20in%20the%20Dark\"&gt;A Blade in the Dark&lt;/a&gt;\" quest.\nReturn to the Greybeards.\nTravel back to &lt;a href=\"High%20Hrothgar%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;High Hrothgar&lt;/a&gt; and present the horn to Arngeir. The &lt;a href=\"Greybeards\"&gt;Greybeards&lt;/a&gt; will gather in the main hall where Wulfgar will teach the final word of the shout Unrelenting Force.\nFollowing this, the Greybeards will perform a ritual that formally recognizes the Dragonborn as Dovahkiin. The Greybeards shout in unison in the Dragon language the following:\n\"Lingrah krosis saraan Strundu'ul, voth nid balaan klov praan nau.Naal Thu'umu, mu ofan nii nu, Dovahkiin, naal suleyk do Kaan, naal suleyk do Shor, ahrk naal suleyk do Atmorasewuth.Myez nu Ysmir, Dovahsebrom. Dahmaan dar rok.\"\nOnce the ritual is finished, the quest is completed."}

Would you mind if I came in?\nANARA: Not at all, serjo. Please. May I offer you some flin?\nCLAVIDES: No thank you. What's your name?\nANARA: Anara, serjo.\nCLAVIDES: Anara, when did your master leave Scath Anud?\nANARA: More than a fortnight ago. That's why it's only me in the castle, serjo. All the other servants and slaves who tend to his lordship travel with him. Is there something wrong?\nCLAVIDES: Yes, there is. Do you know an &lt;a href=\"ashlander\"&gt;ashlander&lt;/a&gt; by the name of Sul-Kharifa?\nANARA: No, serjo. I don't know no one by that name.\nCLAVIDES: Then you aren't likely to now. He's dead. He was found a few hours ago dying of frostbite in the ashlands. He was hysterical, nearly incomprehensible, but among his last words were \u201ccastle\u201d and \u201cXyr.\u201d\nANARA: Dying of frostbite in summertide in the ashlands? B'vek, that's strange. I suppose it's possible that my master knew this man, but being an ashlander and my master being of the &lt;a href=\"House%20Telvanni\"&gt;House of Telvanni&lt;/a&gt;, well, if you'll pardon me for being flippant, serjo, I don't think they coulda been friends.\nCLAVIDES: That is your master's library? Would you mind if I looked in?\nANARA: Please, serjo, go wherever you want. We got nothing to hide. We're loyal Imperial subjects.\nCLAVIDES: As, I hear, are all Telvanni.\nCLAVIDES: The library needs dusting.\nANARA: Yes, serjo. I was just doing that when you knocked at the door.\nCLAVIDES: I'm grateful for that. If you had finished, I wouldn't notice the space in the dust where a rather large book has recently been removed. Your master is a wizard, it seems.\nANARA: No, serjo. I mean, he studies a lot, but he don't cast no spells, if that's what you mean by wizard. He's a kena, went to college and everything. You know, now that I think about it, I know what happened to that book. One of the other kenas from the college been round yesterday, and borrowed a couple of books. He's a friend of the master, so I thought it'd be all fine.\nCLAVIDES: This kena, was his name Warvim?\nANARA: Coulda been. I don't remember.\nCLAVIDES: There is a suspected &lt;a href=\"Necromancer\"&gt;necromancer&lt;/a&gt; at the college named Kena Warvim we arrested last night. We don't know what he was doing at the college, but it was something illegal, that's for certain. Was that the kena who borrowed the book? A little fellow, a cripple with a withered leg?\nANARA: No, serjo, it weren't the kena from yesterday. He was a big fella who could walk, so I noticed.\nCLAVIDES: I'm going to have a look around the rest of the house, if you don't mind.\nANARA: Can I ask, serjo, what you're looking for? Maybe I could help you.\nCLAVIDES: Are these all the rooms in the castle? No secret passages?\nANARA (laughing): Oh, serjo, what would Sedura Kena Telvanni Hordalf Xyr want with secret passages?\nCLAVIDES (looking at the armor): Your master is a big man.\nANARA (laughing): Oh, serjo, don't tease. That's giant armor, just for decoration. My master slew that giant ten years ago, and kind of keeps it for a souvenir.\nCLAVIDES: That's right, I remember hearing something about that when I first took my post here. It was someone named Xyr who killed the giant, but I didn't think the first name was Hordalf. Memory fades I'm afraid. What was the giant's name?\nANARA: I'm afraid I don't remember, serjo.\nCLAVIDES: I do. It was Torfang. \u201cI got out of Torfang's Shield.\u201d\nANARA: I don't understand, serjo. Torfang's shield?\nCLAVIDES: Sul-Kharifa said something about getting out of Torfang's shield. I thought he was just raving, out of his mind.\nANARA: But he ain't got a shield, serjo.\nClavides pushes the high-backed bench out of the way, revealing the large mounted shield at the base of the armor.\nCLAVIDES: Yes, he does. You covered it up with that bench.\nANARA: I didn't do it on purpose, serjo! I was just cleaning! I see that armor ever day, serjo, and b'vek I swear I ain't never noticed the shield before!\nCLAVIDES: It's fine, Anara, I believe you.\nCLAVIDES: It appears that Sedura Kena Telvanni Hordalf Xyr does have a need for a secret passage. Could you get me a torch?\nANARA: B'vek, I ain't never seen that before!\nCLAVIDES: Wait here.\nULLIS: I'm sorry to frighten you.\nANARA: Not now! Go away!\nULLIS: I'm afraid the Captain wouldn't like that, miss.\nANARA: You're ... with the Captain? Blessed mother.\nULLIS: Captain? What's down there?\nCLAVIDES (to Anara): Did you know your master's a necromancer? That your cellar is filled with bodies?\nULLIS: Let me see, serjo.\nCLAVIDES: You'll see soon enough. We're going to need every soldier from the post here to cart away all the corpses. Ullis, I've seen enough battles, but I've never seen anything like this. No two are alike. &lt;a href=\"Khajiit\"&gt;Khajiit&lt;/a&gt;i, &lt;a href=\"Sload\"&gt;sload&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"dunmer\"&gt;dunmer&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Imperial\"&gt;cyrodiil&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"breton\"&gt;breton&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"nord\"&gt;nord&lt;/a&gt;, burned alive, poisoned, electrified, melted, torn apart, turned inside out, ripped to shreds and sewn back up together.\nULLIS: You think the ashlander escaped, that's what happened?\nCLAVIDES: I don't know. Why would someone do something like this, Ullis?\nZOLLASSA: Good morning, you're not Lord Xyr, are you?\nCLAVIDES: No. What do you have there?\nZOLLASSA: A letter and a package I'm supposed to deliver to him. Will he be back shortly?\nCLAVIDES: I don't believe so. Who gave you the package to deliver?\nZOLLASSA: My teacher at the college, Kema Warvim. He has a bad leg, so he asked me to bring these to his lordship. Actually, to tell you the truth, I was supposed to deliver them last night, but I was busy.\nULLIS: Greetings, sistre. We'll give the package to his lordship when we see him.\nZOLLASSA: Ah, hail, brothre. I had heard there was a handsome Argonian in Scath Anud. Unfortunately, I promised Kema Warvim that I'd deliver the package directly to his lordship's hands. I'm already late, I can't just --\nCLAVIDES: We're Imperial Guard, miss. We will take the package and the letter.\nULLIS: You're at the college, if we need to see you?\nZOLLASSA: Yes.

And a pretty one, at that. I hope we weren't too rude to her. I'm tired of all these women with their smooth, wet skin, it would be wonderful if we could meet when I'm off duty.\nULLIS (continued): She looks like she's from the south, like me. You know, Argonians from northern Black Marsh are... much... less...\nCLAVIDES (reading): In black ink \u201cThe Khajiiti male showed surprisingly little fortitude to a simple lightning spell, but I've had interesting physiological results with a medium-level acid spell cast slowly over several days.\u201d In red ink on the margins, \u201cYes, I see. Was the acid spell cast uniformly over the entire body of the subject?\u201d In black ink \u201cThe Nord female was subjected to sixteen hours of a frost spell which eventually crystallized her into a state of suspended animation, from which she eventually expired. Not so the Nord male, nor the Ashlander male who lapsed into their comas much earlier, but then recovered. The Ashlander then tried to escape, but I restrained him. The Nord then had an interesting chemical overreaction to a simple fire spell and expired. See the accompanying illustration.\u201d In red ink, \u201cYes, I see. The pattern of boils and lesions suggest some sort of internal incineration perhaps caused by the combination of a short burst of flame following a longer session with frost. It's such a shame I can't come to see the experiment personally, but I compliment you on your excellent notation.\u201d In black ink, \u201cThank you for the suggestion about slowly poisoning my maid Anara. The dosages you've suggested have had fascinating results, eroding her memory very subtly. I intend to increase it exponentially and see how long it is before she notices. Speaking of which, it is a pity that I haven't any Argonian subjects, but the slave-traders promise me some healthy specimens in the autumn. I should like to test their metabolism in comparison to elves and humans. It's my theory that a medium-level lightning spell cast in a continuous wave on an Argonian wouldn't be lethal for several hours at least, similar to my results with the Cyrodilic female and, of course, the giant.\u201d In red ink, \u201cIt'd be a shame to wait until autumn to see.\u201d\nULLIS (reading the letter): In red ink, \u201cHere is your Argonian. Please let me know the results.\u201d It's signed \u201cKema Warvim.\u201d\nCLAVIDES: By &lt;a href=\"Kynareth\"&gt;Kynareth&lt;/a&gt;, this isn't necromancy. It's &lt;a href=\"Destruction\"&gt;Destruction&lt;/a&gt;. Kema Warvim and Kena Telvanni Hordalf Xyr haven't been experimenting with death, but with the limits of magical torture.\nULLIS: The letter isn't addressed to Kena Telvanni Hordalf Xyr. It's addressed to Sedura Iachilla Xyr. His wife, do you think?\nCLAVIDES: Iachilla. That was the Telvanni of the Xyr family who I heard about in connection with the giant slaying. We'd best get the maid out of here. She'll need to go to a healer.\nANARA: What's happening? Who are you?\nCLAVIDES: Don't worry, everything is going to be fine. We're going to take you to a healer.\nULLIS: Do you need a coat, Iachilla?\nANARA: Thank you, no, I'm not cold --\nCLAVIDES: You have black ink on your fingers, your ladyship.\nULLIS: And when you saw me at the door, you thought I was the Argonian your friend Warvim sent over. That's why you said, \u201cNot now. Go away.\u201d\nANARA/IACHILLA: You're much more observant than Anara. She never did understand what was happening, even when I tripled the poison spell and she expired in what I observed as considerable agony.\nULLIS: What were you going to use on me first, lightning or fire?\nANANA/IACHILLA: Lightning. I find fire to be too unpredictable.\nANANA/IACHILLA: Fascinating."}

A lost colony of &lt;a href=\"Redguards%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Redguards&lt;/a&gt; on the northern coast of &lt;a href=\"High%20Rock%20%28Online%29\"&gt;High Rock&lt;/a&gt;? Patently absurd. But the rumors were so persistent, so consistent, that eventually I was moved to take a sabbatical from my pedagogic duties at the &lt;a href=\"Khefrem%20Academy\"&gt;Academy&lt;/a&gt; and travel north to see for myself.\nAnd behold, by the tears of &lt;a href=\"Morwha\"&gt;Morwha&lt;/a&gt;, it was so! All of the scholarly details will be found in my forthcoming paper \"&lt;a href=\"Sevenfold%20Truths%20of%20the%20Tribe%20of%20the%20Herd-Mother\"&gt;Sevenfold Truths of the Tribe of the Herd-Mother&lt;/a&gt;,\" but I shall summarize the main points here, as I feel this tale is too wondrous to wait upon the slow march of scholarship.\nOn the northwest coast of the High Rock region of &lt;a href=\"Rivenspire\"&gt;Rivenspire&lt;/a&gt;, some leagues west of the city of &lt;a href=\"Shornhelm%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Shornhelm&lt;/a&gt;, is a pastoral basin known as the &lt;a href=\"Silverhoof%20Vale\"&gt;Vale of Silverhoof&lt;/a&gt;. Abiding there, as they have for the past three thousand years, is a tribe of Redguards who go by the simple name of the Horsemen.\nHow did they get there, and when, and why? Unfortunately the Horsemen have no written records, but their oral traditions are strong, and I have recorded those that have been passed down from one generation to the next. The elders of the tribe were generous with their time, particularly two named &lt;a href=\"Muzar\"&gt;Muzar&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Yalaida\"&gt;Yalaida&lt;/a&gt;, and from their tales I have been able to piece together the following tentative history.\nThe Horsemen originally came from Yokuda, of this there can be no doubt. Though they have become unavoidably \"&lt;a href=\"Bretons%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Bretonized&lt;/a&gt;\" over the centuries by contact with the &lt;a href=\"Nedic\"&gt;Nedic&lt;/a&gt; folk who surround them, they retain a number of Yokudan words in daily speech, all spoken with that drawl in the vowels we associate with the steppes of old &lt;a href=\"Akos%20Kasaz\"&gt;Akos Kasaz&lt;/a&gt;. A few examples will suffice from their riding terminology: to tell a horse to turn left, the Horsemen say \"Netu;\" to turn right, \"Netu Hu;\" and to halt, they say \"Selim.\" Of course, \"netu\" is &lt;a href=\"Old%20Yokudan\"&gt;Old Yokudan&lt;/a&gt; for \"turn,\" while \"anselim\" means to stop or to cease.\nSo the Horsemen are of Yokudan descent, most probably from the herding clans of northern Akos Kasaz. The elders of the tribe maintain detailed oral accounts of their genealogy, and from the number of generations they record, it is possible to date their arrival on the shores of &lt;a href=\"Tamriel\"&gt;Tamriel&lt;/a&gt; to the early sixth century of the &lt;a href=\"First%20Era\"&gt;First Era&lt;/a&gt;. This was a period of upheaval in High Rock, when the &lt;a href=\"Direnni%20Hegemony\"&gt;Direnni Hegemony&lt;/a&gt; was in its death throes and the Breton kingdoms were just establishing themselves, a time when a colony of determined settlers could find a niche and establish itself before it could be driven out or absorbed by the indigenes. And according to the tales I heard from Muzar and Yalaida, this is exactly what happened in the Vale of Silverhoof, nearly two centuries before the &lt;a href=\"Ra%20Gada\"&gt;Ra Gada&lt;/a&gt; came to &lt;a href=\"Hammerfell%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Hammerfell&lt;/a&gt;.\nWhy the Horsemen came to this land is harder to determine, for on that subject their tales veer into the legendary or even mythical. Here I must speak about the tribe's unorthodox religious beliefs, for they are central to their traditions and identity. For the Horsemen do not worship any of the Old Yokudan gods as we know them, instead venerating a sort of divine animist spirit they call the &lt;a href=\"Herd%20Mother\"&gt;Herd Mother&lt;/a&gt;. This equine entity acts as the tribe's guiding and protective deity; young Horsemen must commune with her on a vision journey they must partake by themselves that acts as a rite of passage to adulthood (similar to our own tradition of Walkabout). This \"Herd Mother\" is otherwise unknown to modern scholarship, but of course the vast majority of our cultural records were lost in the cataclysm that swallowed the Old Isles.\nThe Horsemen's tradition is that the tribe left lost Yokuda in order to preserve their worship of this Herd Mother, which was somehow endangered in the Old Isles. Their stories describe the journey from Akos Kasaz in a flotilla of \"swimming horse-ships\" given them by the Herd Mother, in which they \"crossed seventeen seas\" before reaching Tamriel. We may discount this tale as somewhat fanciful, but the Horsemen claim to have brought their eponymous mounts with them from the Isles, and this I do not doubt. For to the eye of this connoisseur of horseflesh, the steeds of the Horsemen are unmistakably identical to that breed we call the &lt;a href=\"Yokudan%20Charger\"&gt;Yokudan Charger&lt;/a&gt;, and could have come directly from the &lt;a href=\"Aswala%20Stables\"&gt;Aswala Stables&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;a href=\"Alik%27r%20Desert%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Alik'r&lt;/a&gt;."}

They will tell you that the &lt;a href=\"Gwaering\"&gt;Green Lady's&lt;/a&gt; sister &lt;a href=\"Lanwaen\"&gt;Lanwaen&lt;/a&gt; has been kidnapped by werewolves. They will tell you to go speak with Treethane Nilara to help. \nThe treethane can be found in the center of town, praying at the tree shaped like a lady. She will tell you that Lanwaen's husband &lt;a href=\"Haron\"&gt;Haron&lt;/a&gt; is out looking for her alongside &lt;a href=\"Oraneth\"&gt;Oraneth&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Ungiras\"&gt;Ungiras&lt;/a&gt;. They started looking near the waterfall to the southeast, near &lt;a href=\"Matthild%27s%20Last%20Venture\"&gt;Matthild's Last Venture&lt;/a&gt;, and Nilara will suggest you start looking there too. You will find a backpack there with footprints next to it; these prints hint that whoever was here went northwest. \n\"&lt;The backpack appears to have been dropped hastily. Beside it, footprints dig deep into the mud, as when someone pushes off to run. Other footprints scattered about, both Wood Elves and werewolf, point toward the runner's path.&gt;\"\nHead in that direction and fight your way through some werewolves, and you will find the body of Ungiras. From the wounds on his body, you can deduce that the hunting party was ambushed. Proceed on and you will find Oraneth by some dead werewolves. Speak with her and she will confirm that the werewolves ambushed them. Haron ran further up the road; she is not sure if he is still alive.\nTell Oraneth to head back to the village, then go looking for Haron to the south. There will be a trail of dead werewolves, though there will be plenty living ones as well for you to deal with. Once you find Haron, speak with him and he will tell you that the &lt;a href=\"Hounds%20of%20Hircine%20%28Faction%29\"&gt;Hounds&lt;/a&gt; have a camp nearby; it might contain clues as to Lanwaen's whereabouts. He will send you to search the camp while he tries to gain information from Hound patrols. \n\"&lt;The bow is finely crafted and light to the touch, an elegant weapon. An inscription is carved just below the grip, \"For Lanwaen, my moon and stars.\" Haron will want this.&gt;\"\nThe camp is to your east. You will find Lanwaen's Bow in the center of the camp, and a not titled \"&lt;a href=\"A%20Ragged%20Inscription\"&gt;A Ragged Inscription&lt;/a&gt;\" in the east, under the statue of &lt;a href=\"Hircine%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Hircine&lt;/a&gt;. This notewill tell you that Lanwaen has been taken to a cave by a man named &lt;a href=\"Cirithor\"&gt;Cirithor&lt;/a&gt;; bring this information to Haron and he will tell you there is only one cave nearby where they might have taken her. That cave is &lt;a href=\"Starwalk%20Cavern\"&gt;Starwalk Cavern&lt;/a&gt; to the west; head in there and kill Cirithor. Once he is dead, Haron will free Lanwen; speak with Haron and offer to lead them back to the village. Once back, speak with Lanwaen and she will tell you to inform the Treethane that they are safe. \nSpeak with Treethane Nilara in her house to finish the quest."}

He believes it was once a site of Daedric Worship.\"\nWalkthrough.\n\"Weak. He's weak. You're strong. Crush him.\"\n\"No. Kill him. Crush his bones. Tear at his flesh.\"\n\"You will kill. You will kill, or you will die!\"\nThis quest can be obtained shortly after entering the city of Markarth. &lt;a href=\"Vigilant%20Tyranus\"&gt;Tyranus&lt;/a&gt;, a &lt;a href=\"Vigilants%20of%20Stendarr\"&gt;Vigilant of Stendarr&lt;/a&gt;, will ask the Dragonborn to help him search an abandoned house for evidence of Daedric activity after having spoken with &lt;a href=\"Yngvar%20the%20Singer\"&gt;Yngvar the Singer&lt;/a&gt; about it and Yngvar knowing nothing about it. Upon entering the basement, Tyranus will proclaim that \"This is no ordinary Daedra!\" and run for the door, only to find it locked. &lt;a href=\"Molag%20Bal\"&gt;Molag Bal&lt;/a&gt; will speak and command the Dragonborn to kill Tyranus. After he gives the command to kill Tyranus, the room starts to shake, the lights become dim, and objects move as if by themselves. If the Dragonborn attempts to leave the house (i.e. select the exit door) before killing Tyranus, then Molag Bal will convince Tyranus to attack the Dragonborn. A &lt;a href=\"Scroll%20of%20Calm\"&gt;Scroll of Calm&lt;/a&gt; will not prevent Tyranus from attacking, but casting &lt;a href=\"Harmony%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Harmony&lt;/a&gt; will temporarily cease his attacks until it runs out, at which point he will resume his attack. &lt;a href=\"Voice%20of%20the%20Emperor%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Voice of the Emperor&lt;/a&gt; used by Imperials will calm Tyranus. Either way, Tyranus must be killed in order to progress any further. Afterward, journey down to the altar of Molag Bal in the basement.\n\"Yes. Your reward is waiting for you, mortal. Further down.\"\n\"Yes. Further. Into the bowels.\"\n\"So close. Your prize is waiting.\"\nMolag Bal entraps the Dragonborn in a spiked cage while activating the mace and says that he wants revenge on his rival, &lt;a href=\"Boethiah\"&gt;Boethiah&lt;/a&gt;, and her followers. He wants &lt;a href=\"Logrolf%20the%20Willful\"&gt;Logrolf the Willful&lt;/a&gt;, a priest of Boethiah who has been desecrating Molag Bal's altar in Boethiah's name, lured to him so he may break his spirit.\n\"Fool! Did you think Molag Bal, the Lord of Domination, would so easily reward you? What do you see from that little cage? Speak.\"\nThe location of Logrolf the Willful is randomized; any &lt;a href=\"Forsworn\"&gt;Forsworn&lt;/a&gt; camp may host him. Travel to his marked location and free him. If the quest \"&lt;a href=\"No%20One%20Escapes%20Cidhna%20Mine\"&gt;No One Escapes Cidhna Mine&lt;/a&gt;\" has been completed, then the Forsworn holding him may not be hostile. If all enemies at his location are dealt with\u00a0prior to releasing him, he will immediately return to the abandoned house in Markarth.\n\"You there. Are you here to kill me? Slay the mighty Logrolf while he sits tied and helpless?\"\n\"Ah ha ha! You mortals and your frail, limp, pathetic bodies. Try it again.\"\nOnce back inside the abandoned house, follow Logrolf back to the altar. He will become trapped in the same cage that the Dragonborn stumbled upon earlier. Molag Bal will then grant the Dragonborn his Rusted Mace and instruct them to break Logrolf's will. Attack Logrolf (any means of attacking can be used; the Mace does not have to be used) until he submits to Molag Bal. He will be killed during the first time beating him, where he defiantly taunts Molag Bal until being slain, but Molag Bal will give the Dragonborn a second chance, this time with Logrolf sounding like he is starting to crumble from the torture. Once he submits, the Dragonborn is instructed to kill him. Do so to receive the &lt;a href=\"Mace%20of%20Molag%20Bal%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Mace of Molag Bal&lt;/a&gt; and finish the quest.\n\"The Mace of Molag Bal! I give you its true power, mortal. When your enemies lie broken and bloody before you, know that I will be watching.\""}

These Daedra Lords rebelled against the counsel and admonition of the &lt;a href=\"Tribunal\"&gt;Tribunal&lt;/a&gt;, causing great kinstrife and confusion among the clans and Great Houses.\nMalacath, Mehrunes Dagon, Molag Bal, and Sheogorath are holy in that they serve the role of obstacles during the Testing. Through time they have sometimes become associated with local enemies, like the &lt;a href=\"Nords\"&gt;Nords&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Akaviri\"&gt;Akaviri&lt;/a&gt;, or Mountain &lt;a href=\"Orsimer\"&gt;Orcs&lt;/a&gt;.\nMalacath is the reanimated dung that was &lt;a href=\"Trinimac\"&gt;Trinimac&lt;/a&gt;, Malacath is a weak but vengeful god. The &lt;a href=\"Dunmer\"&gt;Dark Elves&lt;/a&gt; say he is Malak, the god-king of the orcs. He tests the Dunmer for physical weakness.\nMolag Bal is, in Morrowind, the King of Rape. He tries to upset the bloodlines of Houses and otherwise ruin the Dunmer gene pool. A race of monsters, said to live in &lt;a href=\"Molag%20Amur\"&gt;Molag Amur&lt;/a&gt;, are the result of his seduction of &lt;a href=\"Vivec\"&gt;Vivec&lt;/a&gt; during the previous era.\nSheogorath is the King of Madness. He always tests the Dunmer for mental weakness. In many legends he is called upon by one Dunmer faction against another; in half of these stories he does not betray those who called him, further confusing the issue of his place in the scheme of things (can he help us? is he not an obstacle?). He is often associated with the fear other races have of the Dunmer, especially those who, like the Empire, might prove as useful allies.\nMehrunes Dagon is the god of destruction. He is associated with natural dangers like fire, earthquakes, and floods. To some he represents the inhospitable land of Morrowind. He tests the Dunmer will to survive and persevere.\nThe worship of these four malevolent spirits is against the law and practice of the Temple. However, the Four Corners seldom fail to discover those greedy, reckless, or mad enough to serve them. By ancient Temple law and custom, and also by imperial law, the lives of witches and warlocks are forfeit, and Imperial garrisons join &lt;a href=\"Ordinators\"&gt;Ordinators&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Buoyant%20Armigers%20%28Morrowind%29\"&gt;Buoyant Armigers&lt;/a&gt; of the Temple in tracking down and destroying these foul covens in the wilderness refuges and ancient ruins where they conceal their profane worships."}

As you grow and grow until you reach woman's height, so will this beetle grow and grow.\nAnd in the fullness of time, you will cease to grow. But the &lt;a href=\"Assassin%20Beetle%20%28Online%29\"&gt;beetle&lt;/a&gt; will grow on.\nIt was not ever thus. In far-off &lt;a href=\"Yokuda\"&gt;Yokuda&lt;/a&gt;, in times of yore, when all walked in step with the gods, these beetles were the friends of our houses and the amusing companions of our children. They were named &lt;a href=\"Samara%20Scarab\"&gt;Samara Scarab&lt;/a&gt;s. And they grew, yes, but only to the size of an ample millet-loaf, for it was not needful for them to grow larger. For were they not favored of the children? Did they not scamper, and race, and sing the clickety-song? And were they not well-fed therefore, on seeds and savory dung-pellets?\nAye, it was so.\nAnd the lives of the people were good, for though the land was harsh, the people followed the will of the gods, and thus were vouchsafed enough to live well, and a little more. And the Divines were reverenced as it was written they should be, and all things were in their proper places.\nBut some there were among the people who decided that a little more than what they needed was not as much as they did want. And in their avarice they fell away from proper reverence, and were taken, yea, body and soul, with the Hunger of &lt;a href=\"Sep\"&gt;Sep&lt;/a&gt;. And this was an ill thing, for the Hunger of Sep can never be sated.\nThen evil came to Yokuda, and red war, and forbidden rites were practiced, and fell things were summoned that should never have been called forth. It was a Time of Ending. &lt;a href=\"Satakal\"&gt;Satakal&lt;/a&gt; arose from the starry deeps, and Yokuda was pulled down beneath the waves.\nBut after every End Time comes a New Time, and it was even so in this case. For some of the people were permitted to sojourn to &lt;a href=\"Tamriel\"&gt;Tamriel&lt;/a&gt;, where we took for our own. There we were given a chance to once again worship the gods in proper reverence. And we brought our Samara Scarabs with us, that we might delight the children and remember happier days.\nAnd the Hunger of Sep was left behind\u2014for a time, my child, for a time. But it is deep in our mortal core, and may ever arise again. So the gods gave unto us a warning, yea, even unto the smallest children. For in this New Time, in this New Place, our little companions grew to the size of an ample millet-loaf, as was meet. However, they then continued to grow, and burgeon, and sprout hurtful claws and rending mandibles. And then, with tears, we drove them from our homes and into the wastes, where they flourished and became baneful.\nYes, my child\u2014the &lt;a href=\"Assassin%20Beetle%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Assassin Beetle&lt;/a&gt;s that plague the empty places are our own Samara Scarabs, smitten by the gods with the Hunger of Sep. They are a lesson to us, an awful warning to those who would become too avid.\nBe happy, then, and forego all avarice\u2014for here we have enough to live well, and a little more."}

Father of &lt;a href=\"Manbeasts\"&gt;Manbeasts&lt;/a&gt;. The Hungry Cat. &lt;a href=\"Hircine%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Hircine&lt;/a&gt; has many names, but all relate to his one known sphere, the hunt. The &lt;a href=\"Daedric%20Prince\"&gt;Daedric Prince&lt;/a&gt; is obsessed with the chase, the capture, the kill, whether the prey be &lt;a href=\"mer\"&gt;mer&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"man\"&gt;man&lt;/a&gt;, or &lt;a href=\"Beastfolk\"&gt;beast&lt;/a&gt;.\nHircine is a favored subject of &lt;a href=\"Daedra%20worship\"&gt;worship&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Tamriel\"&gt;Tamriel&lt;/a&gt;, although it is not out of line to question this popularity. None would go so far as to call him a deity of benevolence. In fact, Hircine has never seemed to actively want worship or reverence. He simply seeks out, tests and rewards hunters he finds worthy.\nPerhaps that's the appeal of such an idol. There's an odd purity to his savagery. Unlike many other Daedric Princes, his boons are generally found to be more or less fair. All his followers must do is prove themselves to him. Do so, and they are promised an afterlife of endless hunts within his &lt;a href=\"Hunting%20Grounds\"&gt;Hunting Grounds&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe Hunting Grounds\nFollowers of Hircine are promised on thing; an afterlife within the Prince's &lt;a href=\"realm%20of%20Oblivion\"&gt;realm of Oblivion&lt;/a&gt;, known as the Hunting Grounds. An endless forest where endless hunts are held. A land of savagery and violence, where an eternal cycle of death and rebirth take place.\nHunting lodges dot the landscape, home to the souls which haunt this realm. Powerful beats lurk within the forests, allowing Hircine's followers to indulge in spectacular hunts. A true paradise for those who have dedicated their life to the Huntsman Prince.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Great%20Hunt\"&gt;Great Hunt&lt;/a&gt;\nThough a rare occurrence, Hircine does allow the living to enter his realm. This event is known as the Great Hunt, a deadly competition held of the Huntsman Prince's amusement. This contest of skill and cunning has only one goal in mind, capture the &lt;a href=\"Hare\"&gt;Hare&lt;/a&gt; and present it to Hircine. Only then will you earn his favor.\nMany die during this bid for Hircine's boon. It's not uncommon for competitors to turn against one another, or to be killed by one of the many natural dangers the realm presents. And the Hare itself, of course, never goes down without a fight.\n&lt;a href=\"Lycanthropy%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Lycanthropy&lt;/a&gt;\nHircine's title Father of Manbeasts is a well earned one. He's believed to be the creator of lycanthropy, the ability for mer and man to transform into beastial creatures. The most well known of those lycanthrophes are &lt;a href=\"Werewolf%20%28Online%29\"&gt;werewolves&lt;/a&gt;.\nThose infected with lycanthropy, whether by birth or infection, are cursed with an aggressive madness that compels them to bloodlust. Upon their death, they are sent to spend their afterlife within the Hunting Grounds. This is regardless of their allegiance to Hircine.\nThere's no know documentation of a soul escaping the Hunting Grounds, but there is one possibility.

When I was invited to &lt;a href=\"Orsinium%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Orsinium&lt;/a&gt;, I jumped at the chance to explore its untamed wilderness.\nBefore we even arrived at the city of Orsinium, my caravan was attacked by those filthy &lt;a href=\"Winterborn%20%28Faction%29\"&gt;Winterborn&lt;/a&gt;. My protectors were either slain or fled into the hills, so I tried to follow. I soon found myself lost. In my panic, I fell into a small ravine.\nThat was the last I remember before waking up, surrounded by &lt;a href=\"Ogre%20%28Online%29\"&gt;blue-furred giants&lt;/a&gt;. They seemed to take interest in my well-being. Either that, or they were keeping me alive so that could devour me later. Ogres, while technically of the Goblin-kin, are not known for their intelligence, but they are far smarter than most animals. As a rule, I do not study the intelligent races. Circumstances being what they were, I was intrigued enough to record what I was able to observe.\nFrom what I saw, the ogres of the Wrothgarian foothills are far more advanced than the crude brutes I've occasionally encountered near &lt;a href=\"Wayrest%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Wayrest&lt;/a&gt;. Several of them, elders I suppose, seemed to practice some sort of crude totemic magic that involved the manipulation of ice. One of them approached me and studied me with as much interest as I showed in them. That was when something amazing happened.\nMy leg was broken and bleeding from my fall, and I couldn't move. The elder raised his hand in the air and I braced for a strike. Instead, a beam of energy coursed into my leg, freezing it. I could feel the wound stitching together and the bone mending. The pain was excruciating, but I found it to be exhilarating at the same time.\nAs I stood up upon my mended leg, I heard grunts of panic and excitement from the ogres nearby. I thought I had frightened them, but there was a commotion from outside. The ogres, while not capable of conversing in the common speech, do grunt and vocalize. They all repeated the same thing. \"&lt;a href=\"Mad%20Urkazbur\"&gt;Urkazbur&lt;/a&gt;. Urkazbur!\" It was surreal.\nI exited the tent to find a scene of carnage. A larger, angrier ogre was fighting the other ogres. The large one had bony claws strapped to his arms. He slammed them into the ground. Ripples of ice shot out from the impact sites, slamming into the others and knocking them down. The ogre who had healed my leg tossed what appeared to be a glowing ball of snow at the larger one. When it hit him, he reared back and shouted. He gestured and the the snow around him rose up and formed into &lt;a href=\"Madness\"&gt;crude simulacrums&lt;/a&gt; and joined him in the fight.\nWhile the were distracted by all this violence, I escaped. Perhaps one day when I've recovered fully, I'll return to see what became of \"Urkazbur\" and his snow simulacrums."}

There he met two Monsters. One bloodied with the flesh of the chieftain of Othrobar's flock fought him while its mate fled. Fangbith remembered what his master had taught him, that \u201cwhere\u201d was all that was important.\nHe struck the Monster on each of its five vital points: head, groin, throat, back, and chest. Five blows to the five points and the Monster was slain. It was too heavy to carry with him, but still triumphant, Fangbith returned to Othrobar.\n\u201cI say I have slain the Monster that ate your flock,\u201d he cried.\n\u201cWhat proof have you that you have slain any Monster?\u201d asked the chieftain.\n\u201cI say I have saved the flock with my medicine,\u201d said Ghorick the Healer.\n\u201cI say The Goddess has saved the flock by my sacrifices,\u201d said Beran the Priest.\nTwo mornings went by and the flocks were safe, but on the morning of the third day, another tenfold of the chieftain's flock was found butchered. Ghorick the Healer went to his study to find a new medicine. Beran the Priest prepared more sacrifices. Fangbith took his Zolic cudgel in hand, again, and walked far through the dark forest until he came to the base of the Great Mountain. There he met the other Monster, bloodied with the flesh of the chieftain of Othrobar's flock. They did battle, and again Fangbith remembered what his master had taught him, that \u201cwhere\u201d was all that was important.\nHe struck the Monster five times on the head and it fled. Chasing it along the mountain, he struck it five times in the groin and it fled. Running through the forest, Fangbith overtook the Monster and struck it five times in the throat and it fled. Entering into the fields of Othrobar, Fangbith overtook the Monster and struck it five times in the back and it fled. At the foot of the stronghold, the chieftain and his wise men emerged to the sound of the Monster wailing. There they beheld the Monster that had slain the chieftain's flock. Fangbith struck the Monster five times in the chest and it was slain.\nA great feast was held in Fangbith's honor, and the flock of Othrobar was never again slain. Joltereg embraced his student and said, \u201cYou have at last learned the importance of where you strike your blows.\u201d\nPublisher's Note:\nThis tale is another, which has an obvious origin among the &lt;a href=\"Ashlanders%20%28Morrowind%29\"&gt;Ashlanders&lt;/a&gt; tribes of &lt;a href=\"Vvardenfell\"&gt;Vvardenfell&lt;/a&gt; and is one of their oldest tales. \"Marobar Sul\" merely changed the names of the character to sound more \"&lt;a href=\"Dwemer\"&gt;Dwarven&lt;/a&gt;\" and resold it as part of his collection. The Great Mountain in the tale is clearly \"&lt;a href=\"Red%20Mountain\"&gt;Red Mountain&lt;/a&gt;,\" despite its description of being forested. The Star-Fall and later eruptions destroyed the vegetation on Red Mountain, giving it the wasted appearance it has today.\nThis tale does have some scholarly interest, as it suggests a primitive Ashlander culture, but it talks of living in \"strongholds\" much like the ruined strongholds on Vvardenfell today. There are even references to a stronghold of \"Othrobar\" somewhere between Vvardenfell and &lt;a href=\"Skyrim\"&gt;Skyrim&lt;/a&gt;, but few strongholds outside of sparsely-settled Vvardenfell have survived to the present. Scholars do not agree on who built these strongholds or when, but I believe it is clear from this story and other evidence that the Ashlander tribes used these strongholds in the ancient past instead of making camps of wickwheat huts as they do today.\nThe play on words that forms the lesson of the fable -- that it is as important to know where the monster should be slain, at the stronghold, as it is to know where the monster must be struck on its body to be slain -- is typical of many Ashlander tales. Riddles, even ones as simple as this one, are loved by both the Ashlanders and the vanished Dwemer. Although the Dwemer are usually portrayed as presenting the riddles, rather than being the ones who solve it as in Ashlander tales."}

On the &lt;a href=\"Calendar%20%28Daggerfall%29\"&gt;20th of Evening Star&lt;/a&gt; the Prince of Domination Molag Bal may be summoned, if the Agent agrees to pay a summoner of either a &lt;a href=\"Witch%20Coven\"&gt;Witch Coven&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Mages%20Guild%20%28Daggerfall%29\"&gt;Mages Guild&lt;/a&gt; or a &lt;a href=\"Temples%20%28Daggerfall%29\"&gt;temple&lt;/a&gt;.\nWalkthrough.\nThe Agent may approach a summoner at either the Mages Guild, a Temple, or a Witch Coven to summon one of the Daedric Princes. If the summoning occurs on the 20th of Evening Star, the Agent may receive a vision of Molag Bal, whom immediately offers them a quest. Indeed, Molag Bal recognises the Agent's desire for power, stating that it is \"a far more tangible quantity than wisdom,\" and hence offers the Agent \"a simple assassination.\"\nNon-contracted Power.\nAccepting Molag Bal's offer will reveal that a mage \"has been invoking [Molag Bal's] name\" and using the Prince's power \"without a contract.\" While the Prince acknowledges that this may be \"due to ignorance,\" they cannot tolerate any misdirected abuse of their power. The Agent is therefore sent to slay said mage, before meeting with an apostle of Molag Bal's to receive the Prince's boon, the &lt;a href=\"Mace%20of%20Molag%20Bal%20%28Daggerfall%29\"&gt;Mace of Molag Bal&lt;/a&gt;.\nWith that the Agent should head to the dungeon mentioned by Molag Bal and track down the mage. There is a potential for the dungeon to be populated by other unrelated mages, meaning the Agent will have to keep fighting until one of two notifications appears.\nA Simple Kill.\nShould the Agent strike the mage and deal a fatal blow within three in-game minutes then the following notification will appear:\n\"[Mage's name] is dead. You have fulfilled your contract with Molag Bal. Now to collect your reward.\"\nWith that, the Agent simply has to exit the dungeon and head to the regional tavern where Molag Bal stated their apostle would be. Once there, the Agent must speak with the apostle before the time limit expires to complete the quest and receive their reward.\nA Draining Resource.\nHowever, should the Agent fail to deal a killing blow within three in-game minutes then the following notification will appear:\n\"[Mage's name] lifts his staff and disappears in a thunderclap.\"\nIn order to complete the quest, the Agent must look for a clue as to where the mage will have gone. Fortunately, a note will appear elsewhere in the dungeon, revealing not only the location of the mage, but knowledge that they were indeed invoking the name of Molag Bal without authority:\n\"\"A map showing the location of [second dungeon] marked with the notation, \"Remind [Minion's name] to lay in supplies. Indications that Molag Bal has detected me.\"\"\"\nWith that, the Agent should head to this second lair, another dungeon and slay the mage, who will be unable to disappear a second time. Once the mage lies dead the Agent must quickly escape the dungeon and meet with Molag Bal's apostle as above, before the time limit expires.\nRewards.\nCompleting the quest successfully within the time limit will see the Agent rewarded with the Mace of Molag Bal by the Prince's apostle. The Agent will also receive a boost in reputation with the faction whom summoned the Prince for them, as well as the faction's associates. Conversely, failing the quest will result in the Agent losing reputation with the summoner's faction.\nThe changes made to reputation, either by successfully completing or failing the quest are shown below:"}

Remove unflattering ranting about the Master!\"\nMy employment at the apothecary in &lt;a href=\"Wayrest%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Wayrest&lt;/a&gt; is one of dedication through tireless and thankless servitude. Though my knowledge of ingredients from mountain to meadow is formidable, and my handiness with a blade is revered by the rivals I have scarred or slain, the trickle of debt to the Master and shop owner, &lt;a href=\"magister\"&gt;magister&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Alchemists%20%28Online%29\"&gt;alchemist&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Defessus%20Lector\"&gt;Defessus Lector&lt;/a&gt;, continues to be paid. I have been in the Master's service (and put up with his eccentricities and bouts of verbal abuse) for nigh on fifteen years, but my devotion is still unwavering.\nMy upbringing was inadequate, my father an unknown member of the &lt;a href=\"Lion%20Guard\"&gt;Lion Guard&lt;/a&gt; and my mother a &lt;a href=\"Reachmen%20%28Online%29\"&gt;primitive&lt;/a&gt; from &lt;a href=\"the%20Reach\"&gt;the Reach&lt;/a&gt;. Saved from sacrifice by the Master before my fealty to &lt;a href=\"Hircine%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Hircine&lt;/a&gt; was sworn, my curse of birth extends to my Reachman name of Gargrell. The Master is always quick to point out the inadequacies of these primitives (though he is less circumspect when I approach the subject of my ravaging father's loins). My youthful anger, which was once channeled into assassinations, thanks (according to the Master) to \"my barbarian blood,\" is now behind me, and I seek wisdom from behind the bowls, jars, and potions as second apprentice of the &lt;a href=\"Wayrest%20Apothecary\"&gt;Wayrest Apothecary&lt;/a&gt;.\nRecently, the death of First Apprentice &lt;a href=\"Evangeline%20Beanique\"&gt;Evangeline Beanique&lt;/a&gt; (&lt;a href=\"Arkay\"&gt;Arkay&lt;/a&gt; carry her soul to peace) has allowed my station at this shop to marginally improve: I no longer am employed at slopping out latrines, carrying the burdensome raw ingredients from trader's caravan to storage chamber shelf, and other menial tasks. Now I am left to run the Wayrest Apothecary, usually with the simpleton &lt;a href=\"Bardus\"&gt;Bardus&lt;/a&gt;, a work-shy nincompoop seemingly conjured at this shop with the singe purpose of providing foreign traders with stories about &lt;a href=\"Bretons%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Breton&lt;/a&gt; inbreeding.\nBut acting as apothecary shepherd is but one of two important tasks: The Master requires a further undertaking. I am to create a journal, of which these are the preliminary scribbles. A book useful to the apothecary servant and master alike: a formidable list of ingredients revealed in both drawing and description, recollections of where each is found, and the state they must be presented in for bartering, as well as the usefulness of each component to the alchemist and &lt;a href=\"enchanter\"&gt;enchanter&lt;/a&gt;. Our shelves brim over with gathered materials from the corners of &lt;a href=\"Tamriel\"&gt;Tamriel&lt;/a&gt;; a bounty of &lt;a href=\"Mundus\"&gt;Mundus&lt;/a&gt; within the four walls (and numerous outhouses) of the apothecary at Wayrest.\nAssuming Bardus can read, this text should also serve as a teaching tool so the half-wit learns to provide our customers with accurate ingredients, and not violently dangerous powders that only seem similar to one another: Hall Steward &lt;a href=\"Longinus%20Attius\"&gt;Longinus Attius&lt;/a&gt; still launches furious verbal tirades about our incompetence while he visited here (his &lt;a href=\"Vampire%20Dust\"&gt;vampire dust&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Frost%20Salts\"&gt;frost salts&lt;/a&gt; were mislabeled, resulting in a concoction that induced violent uprisings from the bowels and actually worsened his case of &lt;a href=\"ticklebritch\"&gt;ticklebritch&lt;/a&gt;). Personally, I would have murdered Bardus where he stood, but the Master knows better. Instead, I work like an &lt;a href=\"Argonians%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Argonian&lt;/a&gt; slave to keep this trading post in good standing.\nAside from scouring our shelves, what better repository of knowledge is there than the traders that frequent this establishment? The Master's powerful standing, our web of &lt;a href=\"Merchants%20%28Online%29\"&gt;merchants&lt;/a&gt; from across the &lt;a href=\"provinces\"&gt;provinces&lt;/a&gt;, and our system of nimble couriers all conspire to provide a wealth of knowledge, a plentiful supply of even the rarest items, and a worn welcome mat. My Master's fondness for &lt;a href=\"Moon%20Sugar%20%28Online%29\"&gt;moon sugar&lt;/a&gt; allows &lt;a href=\"Khajiit%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Khajiiti&lt;/a&gt; caravans preferential treatment during their bartering. Elven &lt;a href=\"Thalmor%20Justiciar\"&gt;Justiciars&lt;/a&gt; come here to gather for their powerful mage masters. &lt;a href=\"Grundvik%20Cold-Fist\"&gt;Nord hunters&lt;/a&gt; arrive to seek &lt;a href=\"Kyne\"&gt;Kyne&lt;/a&gt;'s and a cure for &lt;a href=\"yellow%20tick\"&gt;yellow tick&lt;/a&gt;. And a &lt;a href=\"Redguards%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Redguard&lt;/a&gt; merchant burdened with exotic ingredients is always welcomed with open arms.\nAll the awareness of visiting alchemists, merchants, and enchanters shall be imparted! I jot it all down in this journal, add graceful illustrations, and alter my writings to remove personal feelings.

Speak with her and She will tell you she has finished the potion for your initiation. When you tell her you are ready for the trial, she will give you the potion and tell you to drink it in the back of the tent so that you will receive visions of the Ash'abah's past. \nHead to the back and drink the potion.

After you are done talking, Haqmir will ask to speak with you away from the Vizier's ears. Speak with him in the other room and he will agree with you that you should not flee this place. Striking down the king woule mean dishonour and exile; he will offer to take this burden upon himself.

In doing so, your ancestors trapped Feremuzh in a tomb of earth for time eternal. That earth has been deemed unholy and accursed. Know the marks of the cursed land so you may avoid it. The entrance is tucked into the base of a sharp cliffside, at the end of a path cutting through the rocks.

I was tending to the elders in their cells, bringing them food and water, listening to their soothing songs. The moths\u2019 gentle wings fluttered, tranquil as always, when suddenly I was confronted by hideous apparitions! Incorporeal dead roamed the halls, and it appeared to me as if the moths were feeding on them\u2014sucking wisps of ghostly material, perhaps their very souls, into hungry maws! Please, Abbot, tell me this is madness, that this is not so!\u201d\nIt is not unusual for initiates of our Order to suffer unsettling dreams, especially as they learn more of the nature of our sacred charges, the &lt;a href=\"Elder%20Scrolls\"&gt;Elder Scrolls&lt;/a&gt;, and the ancestors that grant us the wisdom to approach their infinite mysteries. Though much of the knowledge gained through readings of the Scrolls must be experienced personally to truly comprehend it, and despite being quite exhausted from my daily rigors, I was able to help him set aside his fears about our Order\u2019s relationship with mortal souls and the moths that preserve fragments of their erudition from beyond mortality.\nNot for us are the brutal methods of the conjurer or necromancer, tearing the soul from its vessel, constraining it and forcibly redirecting its energies with no regard for its journey or contents. No, the interplay of moth and ancestor soul is delicate and as natural as the canticle trees themselves, and we are patient and conscientious observers hoping to make sense of the cosmic tapestry by glimpsing its threads. It is through service to the moths and the ancestors that we gain guidance, not through the clumsy coercion of will without understanding the consequences.\nThe soul, I told him, has much in common with the moth\u2014they are a symbolic pair. Though it is typical to think of it as the &lt;a href=\"Aedric\"&gt;Aedric&lt;/a&gt; essence at the core of every mortal, I advised him to consider the soul in another light, scaled like the wings of the moth, and to imagine it comprised of vessels filled through the events of mortal existence. On release from life on &lt;a href=\"Nirn\"&gt;Nirn&lt;/a&gt;, it is our belief that a kind of dissipation begins, and it is then that the moths learn the song of a soul\u2019s fjyrons, which are shepherded under our care and protected generation after generation.\nThe fjyrons themselves must retain a connection to the grand fabric of creation, to the scattered soul-remnants in all their destinations. Through this link and with patient care, we receive guidance from beyond the present or past and the known world, where time is irrelevant. The moths do not capture or devour the souls of the ancestors, but only repeat to us what they\u2019ve filtered, like a chorus repeating the verses of a grand song.\nI could tell that, though the full dawn of understanding had not broken for him yet, his wild fears about the &lt;a href=\"Cult%20of%20the%20Ancestor%20Moth\"&gt;ancestor moths&lt;/a&gt; were somewhat allayed. I was pleased to assist him in his journey, and told him he would have ample time to ponder the nature of souls as he scrubbed the silkroom floors for the next week\u2014penance for intruding on my nightly reverie."}

It was when her blood first spilled that the manifestation began.\nThe witch grew suddenly still, as if in a trance. At once, a chill wind filled the chamber, and the flame of the braziers turned an unearthly shade of green. Echoing all about, yet seemingly coming from no discernable source, all present heard a guttural, but unmistakably cogent chant, almost like a religious invocation. Upon reflection, I suspect that this was the &lt;a href=\"Daedric%20Alphabet\"&gt;language&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"Oblivion%20%28Realm%29\"&gt;Oblivion&lt;/a&gt;; the obscene tongue of the &lt;a href=\"Daedric%20Princes\"&gt;Daedric Princes&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe iron chains that bound Henghild to the slab crumbled, impossibly, and fell away. Her back arched and her eyes rolled back in her head. Slowly, her body rose with no visible means of levitation, suddenly hovering several feet above the slab.\nAfter a moment, her mouth opened and she began to speak. But it was not the voice of the crone that issued forth, but rather the voice of a &lt;a href=\"Daedra%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Daedric&lt;/a&gt; abomination. Her words were transcribed by no fewer than three witnesses. I record them here, in their entirety:\n\"Pain unto innocence. Screams in the dark. &lt;a href=\"Nocturnal\"&gt;Nocturnal&lt;/a&gt; is here.\n\"My loyal servant is tortured and burned, bound and tormented, bereft of her life.\n\"The clan called &lt;a href=\"Direfrost%20Family\"&gt;Direfrost&lt;/a&gt; think themselves righteous, but Nocturnal has seen their wickedness.\n\"My curse be upon you, and your descendants.\n\"Your judgement will first be rendered in the form of an Ice Queen who comes in the guise of a pauper.\n\"Your blood shall be frozen. Your torment long and painful.\n\"And when your savior comes to release you, know that your true suffering has only just begun.\n\"There will be a reckoning between past and present, and the name Direfrost will lie in tatters before the end.\n\"A new Ice Queen will bring unto Direfrost all the anguish of Oblivion, and you shall know true suffering.\"\nAt this moment, the crone's body burst into green flame, and crumbled to ash."}

Indeed, Mephala believes \"it is natural for a worm to want to evolve into a wasp,\" and will therefore give the Agent a means of doing so.\nParanoid in Power.\nAccepting the quest will reveal that a &lt;a href=\"Nobles%20%28Daggerfall%29\"&gt;noble&lt;/a&gt; in another town has become a problem for Mephala, and must be destroyed. However, the \"irksome official\" has locked themselves \"snug and secure in his palace,\" meaning the Agent must find a way to get inside and kill him. If the Agent does so successfully then they are told to meet with a servant of Mephala in a second town, whom will hand the Agent their reward: The &lt;a href=\"Ebony%20Blade%20%28Daggerfall%29\"&gt;Ebony Blade&lt;/a&gt;.\nGuards upon Guards.\nWith that the Agent must head to the town mentioned by Mephala and find their way into the Palace. However, while Mephala implies that it will be difficult to gain entry to the Palace, the fort will in fact be unlocked between 10:00 and 18:00. The Agent simply has to enter the Palace and track down their target, whom will have some &lt;a href=\"Warrior%20%28Daggerfall%29\"&gt;warriors&lt;/a&gt; acting as body guards, which will attack the Agent on sight.\nThe noble themselves will appear as a &lt;a href=\"Knight%20%28Daggerfall%29\"&gt;knight&lt;/a&gt;, and will shout when struck:\n\"You sneaking assassins are all the same. That's why I decided to get myself some real protection. [Giant's name]! Wake up, you big oaf. Kill!\"\nThe Agent must now slay the noble, their pet &lt;a href=\"Giant%20%28Daggerfall%29\"&gt;giant&lt;/a&gt; and the remaining bodyguards, although only the noble requires killing. Upon their death the Agent will be notified thus:\n\"Mephala would be proud-- [Noble's name] is dead. Time to make your escape.\"\nWith that, the Agent should escape the Palace and head to the second town identified by Mephala, and find the Prince's apostle. Speaking with the apostle before the time limit expires will see the Agent receive the Ebony Blade, successfully completing the quest.\nRewards.\nCompleting the quest successfully within the time limit will see the Agent rewarded with the &lt;a href=\"Ebony%20Blade%20%28Daggerfall%29\"&gt;Ebony Blade&lt;/a&gt; by the Prince's apostle. The Agent will also receive a boost in reputation with the faction whom summoned the Prince for them, as well as the faction's associates. Conversely, failing the quest will result in the Agent losing reputation with the summoner's faction.\nThe changes made to reputation, either by successfully completing or failing the quest are shown below:"}

Legend holds that his body was secretly returned to Skyrim and buried with the crown, but the exact whereabouts were lost in the following &lt;a href=\"War%20of%20Succession\"&gt;War of Succession&lt;/a&gt;, until its resting place was discovered during the &lt;a href=\"Skyrim%20Civil%20War\"&gt;Civil War&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"4E%20201\"&gt;4E 201&lt;/a&gt;.\nBoth sides of the conflict coveted the crown, due to its historical associations.\nQuests.\n&lt;a href=\"The%20Jagged%20Crown%20%28Quest%29\"&gt;The Jagged Crown&lt;/a&gt;.\nDepending on the side chosen by the &lt;a href=\"Last%20Dragonborn\"&gt;Dragonborn&lt;/a&gt;, either &lt;a href=\"Galmar%20Stone-Fist\"&gt;Galmar Stone-Fist&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"Legate%20Rikke%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Legate Rikke&lt;/a&gt; dispatch their men to seek the artifact, hoping to, respectively, consolidate either &lt;a href=\"Ulfric%20Stormcloak%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Ulfric's&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"Elisif%20the%20Fair\"&gt;Elisif's&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"High%20King%23Ascension\"&gt;ascendance&lt;/a&gt; to the throne. The crown is worn by King &lt;a href=\"Borgas\"&gt;Borgas&lt;/a&gt;, who appears as a leveled draugr at &lt;a href=\"Korvanjund\"&gt;Korvanjund&lt;/a&gt;, where both &lt;a href=\"Stormcloaks\"&gt;Stormcloaks&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Imperial%20Soldier%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Imperials&lt;/a&gt; clash. Once it has been recovered, it must be returned to either faction for the questline to continue.\nKeeping the crown.\nThe Jagged Crown can be kept by reverse-&lt;a href=\"pickpocket\"&gt;pickpocket&lt;/a&gt;ing it to either &lt;a href=\"Hadvar\"&gt;Hadvar&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"Ralof\"&gt;Ralof&lt;/a&gt;, after the crown is collected but before the quest is completed. Although the chance of success will show as zero percent, it is still possible to pickpocket successfully. However, this may require several attempts. The &lt;a href=\"Factions%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;faction&lt;/a&gt; sided with at &lt;a href=\"Helgen\"&gt;Helgen&lt;/a&gt; must be joined for the exploit to function properly, however, after reverse-pickpocketing the crown, it is possible to betray the chosen faction by bringing the quest item to the opposing capital city. It is still important to keep backup saves, though, to ensure that Hadvar or Ralof do not disappear after the betrayal. Normally, Hadvar will immediately appear back in Riverwood, and Ralof does so after the main quest is completed; if this does not occur, then the Civil War questline will become broken, and thus a reload is required to continue it. Once the quest is complete, the crown can be pickpocketed back from &lt;a href=\"Hadvar\"&gt;Hadvar&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"Ralof\"&gt;Ralof&lt;/a&gt; during the Battle for &lt;a href=\"Whiterun%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Whiterun&lt;/a&gt;, or at &lt;a href=\"Riverwood%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Riverwood&lt;/a&gt; after the Civil War.

The crown would legitimize your claim.\"\"\nUlfric: \"A crown doesn't make a king.\"\"\nGalmar: \"No, but this one...\"\"\nUlfric: \"If it even exists.\"\"\nGalmar: \"It exists. And it'll be the symbol of the righteousness of our cause. Think about it. The Jagged Crown! It heralds back to a time before jarls and moots. Back to the time when a king was a king because his enemies fell before him, and his people rose because they loved him. Skyrim needs that king. You will be that king, Ulfric. You must be.\"\"\nUlfric: \"You're certain you've found it?\"\"\nGalmar: \"When have I ever been false with you?\"\"\nUlfric: \"Fine. I'll send the Unblooded here with you. Fancy a crawl through a moldering dungeon to see if you can't stir up Galmar's Jagged Crown?\"\"\nGalmar: \"It'll be there. You'll see.\"\"\nGalmar will next instruct the Dragonborn to head to &lt;a href=\"Korvanjund\"&gt;Korvanjund&lt;/a&gt; to retrieve the crown. Upon arrival at Korvanjund, a small group of Stormcloak soldiers led by Galmar Stone-Fist and &lt;a href=\"Ralof\"&gt;Ralof&lt;/a&gt; (if followed through Helgen) is met. Inside is a waiting squad of Imperial Legionnaires.\nImperial Legion.\nUpon returning from the previous quest, &lt;a href=\"Legate%20Rikke%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Legate Rikke&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"General%20Tullius%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;General Tullius&lt;/a&gt; will be in conversation.\nTullius: \"Tell me again, why I'm wasting men chasing after a fairy tale.\"\"\nRikke: \"If Ulfric gets his hand on that crown, it won't be a fairy tale. It'll be a problem.\"\"\nTullius: \"Don't you &lt;a href=\"Nords%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Nords&lt;/a&gt; put any stock in your own traditions? I thought the Moot chose the king.

I'm entrusting you with what resources I can spare.

You can send him/her back when you get there and find nothing but old bones and cobwebs.\"\"\nRikke: \"The Stonefist's no fool. He's found the Crown. But we'll get to it first.\"\"\nLegate Rikke will then instruct the Dragonborn to head to Korvanjund and retrieve the crown. Upon arrival at Korvanjund, there is a small group of Imperial soldiers led by Legate Rikke and &lt;a href=\"Hadvar\"&gt;Hadvar&lt;/a&gt; (if followed through Helgen). There are Stormcloaks that need to be defeated before entering the tomb.\nKorvanjund.\nAfter entering the door to Korvanjund Temple, there are battles to be fought. Once proceeding through a large room to the north is completed, there is another room with two levels. Besides a path north on the ground floor, following the upper around the room counter-clockwise leads to another passage north. As part of the Stormcloaks, it is possible to snipe the waiting Imperials in the next room from above, and vice versa.\nAcross that room to the north, the path leads down to a middle level. Then it turns left (west), then left again (north). Immediately to the left are steps leading down to the left (north) to the bottom level. On the east side of the room are steps leading up to an empty chest with &lt;a href=\"Jornibret%27s%20Last%20Dance\"&gt;Jornibret's Last Dance&lt;/a&gt; to the left and a skeletal corpse.\nBack up on the second level, a circular opening leads west to a room with many urns and several corpses, including one of a &lt;a href=\"Draugr%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;draugr&lt;/a&gt;. In the southwest corner is a doorway that leads to a passage that winds\u00a0south and west until it gets to a door to Kovanjund Halls.\nBeyond the door is a room with steps up at the north end and several more corpses, including draugr. At the top of the steps, the path turns left, then left again, leading to a doorway to the west. Beyond that, the path turns right (north) and leads to a T intersection to the left (west). The west path goes through a swinging axe trap. On the other side is a chest with random loot and a lever that disables the trap.\nBack at the intersection, continuing north leads to a stone door with concentric, rotatable rings, similar to the one in &lt;a href=\"Bleak%20Falls%20Barrow%20%28Location%29\"&gt;Bleak Falls Barrow&lt;/a&gt; (also known as a &lt;a href=\"Dragon%20Claws%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;dragon claw&lt;/a&gt; or puzzle door). The door requires the use of the &lt;a href=\"Ebony%20Dragon%20Claw\"&gt;Ebony Dragon Claw&lt;/a&gt;, found on the ground in front of doorway, lying next to a dead soldier. The code for the door is on the palm of the Ebony claw (this applies to all dragon claws). The code for the Korvanjund door is fox, moth, dragon (from outer ring to inner).\nThrough the door to the north, the path is blocked by debris. Another path leads left (west) to a large room with a barred doorway to the west. A passageway to the right (north) turns left (west), then left again (south), winding up steps to a second level of the same room. There is an altar against the west wall that has a dagger on it. If it is removed, a passageway opens up that leads to another stone doorway that can be opened by pulling on a chain to its right. Inside is a booby-trapped chest with leveled loot. A lever next to the southern wall will close and reopen the stone door.\nAt the southern end, the path continues left (east) across two short walkways to a chest. Right after stepping off the wooden walkway, to the left (north), there is a handle on the wall (located by a burial urn). Pulling this will unlock the barred doorway. Also, when the door opens several draugr will appear in the room. Once they are defeated, the path to the west leads to Korvanjund Crypt.\nThe path leads west, then south, then east, then opens up to a room with a leveled draugr sitting on a throne. Behind the throne to the left side are two bowls on ledges containing hidden loot. Interacting with the draugr will wake it, turning it hostile. Sneaking and then attacking it will make it much easier to defeat. This draugr will raise three other leveled draugr. After defeating them, the Jagged Crown can be looted from the dethroned draugr. Note that this item is not obtainable after the quest is finished.\nAfter retrieving the crown, to the south of the draugr's throne is a &lt;a href=\"Word%20Walls%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;word wall&lt;/a&gt; for the \"&lt;a href=\"Slow%20Time\"&gt;Slow Time&lt;/a&gt;\" shout. Next to the Word Wall, against the eastern wall, a short log ramp leads up to a series of passages that eventually lead to a door back to Korvanjund Temple. From there, it is possible to exit back to Skyrim.\nSwitching sides (optional).\nWhile the Jagged Crown is in the possession of the Dragonborn, they can also decide to travel to the capital city of the opposition to hand over the crown to either General Tullius in Solitude or Jarl Ulfric Stormcloak in Windhelm. The leader of the opposing faction will accept the crown and unceremoniously recognize the Dragonborn as a member of their faction. From there on, the Dragonborn will fight the &lt;a href=\"Civil%20War\"&gt;Civil War&lt;/a&gt; for their new allies. However, with this method, the Dragonborn is not given a set of armor, as they were never fully initiated, so one will have to acquire the faction's gear through other means."}

He hopes nothing unpleasant has happen to her and the Vestige offers to look for her.\nEnter the tomb and a spirit has appeared, talk to him and see if he knows where to find Lady Laurent.

He died in this tomb along with the king, his bones have turned to dust but he remains. Perhaps the Vestige can help him and he then can help them in return?\nA noble with delusions of treasure hunting entered the tomb earlier he says, he'll help finding the vault she seeks, in return the Vestige must help him. But before anything else, he wants to make sure the Vestige have the skills to handle the traps his former liege put in place and says they must now go and talk to the lady. They'll talk more later.\nGo further into the tomb to find Lady Laurent. She guesses another adventurer has arrived, and of course they must know who she is as she is famous!

She wants the Vestige to get the crown while she is waiting.\nFour keys are needed to open the vault, she has one and hands it over to the Vestige. It's an heirloom and has been in the family for generations. The other three are hidden in the tomb somewhere.\nFollow the markers to find the three keys. Throughout the tomb are skeleton warriors, fight them on the way to the keys. After finding all keys, place them in their correct sconces upstairs and watch what happens. After the Forgotten Seneschal ritual is complete, the door to the vault is unlocked. He is standing in front of the vault entrance, go and talk to him.\nHe says as he has helped them come this far, return the favor and free him from this prison. He can't enter the vault, there are two crowns inside, but one may only take one. One is the Jeweled Crown of Anton, the other bears the curse that binds him here. He wants them to take the cursed crown. It wont hurt the Vestige as their soul is already trapped elsewhere. But if anyone else touches the crown, they will be bound here. They will take his place and he will be free.\nWhen the Vestige asks him why they should doom Lady Laurent, he explains that greed and cowardice have a price. She craves the tombs treasures but send them to take the risks. He consider this justice.\nEnter the vault, but before taking one of the crowns they need to defeat the vault's guardian. Make a choice and take one of the crowns and then find the way out of the tomb. Find Lady Laurent in her camp and talk to her. She is pleased to see the Vestige has the crown and complement their dungeon skills. She asks them to place the crown on the table so she can gaze upon its majesty.\nAfter completing the quest, Stibbons comes up and asks if he shall move the crown to a safe place. Unaware of what happens next, Lady Laurent takes a sip from her mug and Stibbons falls to the ground when touching the crown. His spirit leaves the body and walks away, seconds later the Forgotten Seneschal arrives and take over Stibbon's body.\nIf the Jeweled Crown of Anton is chosen, after completing the quest, Stibbons comes up and asks if he shall move the crown to a safe place. The Forgotten Seneschal appears waiting for the crown to affect Stibbons. Nothing happens to Stibbons and he just places the crown inside the chest in the tent. The Seneschal states that the Vestige betrayed him (and sounds shocked). Stibbons goes in the direction of the beach to look for the fish to make the stew."}

That I can hear what it tells me. But when I wake up all I can recall is a glowing orb with light so intense that I have to shield my eyes.\nOther things haunt my dreams. Dark images and frightful events. I've seen the sky turn dark and split apart to allow giant shackles to crash into the earth.

I've felt them sink into my neck and watched the creature burst into flames as it drank my blood. And then I see a cold, blue land. Jagged rocks that float in the alien sky. A sky I've never seen in the waking world. I hear screams in the distance. And everything is cold and death and nothingness.\nThen the light appears once more, as if to guide me to safety. To tell me something. To say \u2026 and that's when I wake up.\nI exhaust myself. I drink too much. And still the nightmares come to me.

Those idiots at Cyrodilic Collections actually granted me access to their precious research. It was child's play to steal their notes! Not only do these notes save me the time and trouble of conducting the research myself, it points me to exactly the Argonian antiquities that I've been looking for.

They see Argonians as a put-upon, downtrodden people, but nothing could be further from the truth. The Argonians are a menace! I know what I'm talking about. After all, I barely survived my two treks through the swamps of Murkmire. Various tribes of lizards hunted me, killed my companions, and left me for dead when I simply tried to negotiate with them. The hateful creatures! Why wouldn't they leave me alone? And why did the &lt;a href=\"Dead-Water%20Tribe\"&gt;Dead-Water&lt;/a&gt; warriors have to kill my beloved son? He was just trying to protect me!\nWell, what's done is done. Now that I have the sacred secret, I just need to find am Argonian who can accurately translate the lizard scribblings and tell me where to find the relic I seek.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Blackguards\"&gt;Blackguards&lt;/a&gt; might be crude and hot-headed, but they lived up to their part of our bargain. They located six potential experts on Argonian antiquities, specifically on the period known as &lt;a href=\"Duskfall\"&gt;Duskfall&lt;/a&gt; and the time before it. I don't believe for a moment that the lizards actually built those &lt;a href=\"xanmeer\"&gt;xanmeer&lt;/a&gt;s and other stone structures. However, I can certainly see them squatting in such places and claiming them as their own.\nI'll make these Argonians tell me everything they know.

But beneath its jagged surface shines a color, a gleam of possibility, unrefined but full of promise. And with just a little polish, that stone has the potential to become a beautiful, glittering gem.\nThe art of &lt;a href=\"Jewelry%20%28Online%29\"&gt;jewelry&lt;/a&gt; crafting rests within us all, but not everyone has the ability to see that capacity. Therefore, I've taken it upon myself to write a guide to how one may begin to polish his or her skill. And through these simple steps, any novice can learn the basics of jewelry crafting.\nAcquiring the &lt;a href=\"Crafting%20Materials%23Jewelry%20crafting%20materials\"&gt;Pewter Dust&lt;/a&gt;\nPewter is an excellent material for any novice to begin with. Not only is it easily malleable, it is also absurdly abundant. One must simply keep an eye out for pewter seams within the wilderness. Much like ores, you'll generally find these seams within rocky outcroppings. There, you can easily acquire the needed pewter dust to begin your crafting.\nRefining the Pewter Ounces\nNext, one must refine their pewter dust into pewter ounces. You can do this at any jewelry crafting station you happen upon, which can generally be found within large cities. Of course, I would also recommend placing a personal crafting station within your home, if possible. I've found the convenience to be well worth the cost.\nCrafting the Ring\nNow is the time to put those pewter ounces to good use. While a simple pewter ring may not seem the most glamorous item to craft, it is certainly an excellent item to begin with. Again, a jewelry crafting station is needed to complete this task.\nDeconstructing Jewelry\nA jewelry crafting station can be used to not only craft jewelry, but also to deconstruct it. Deconstruction allows you to regain a portion of the ingredients used to create the ring or necklace. For example, a deconstructed pewter ring will give you pewter ounces. Of course, as in most aspects of crafting, this will also enable you to gain experience.\nResearching &lt;a href=\"Traits\"&gt;Traits&lt;/a&gt;\nJewelry, while beautiful in its own right, can also be extremely useful. Given the right traits, your rings and necklaces can help increase health, stamina, and even magicka reserves. To craft jewelry with a desired trait, you must first research a piece of jewelry that already possesses that trait. If you find a pewter ring with the robust trait, for example, researching that ring will help you create new pieces of jewelry that are also robust. Sadly, this process always destroys whatever item is researched. But such is progress.\nFinal Word\nIt is my sincere hope that this guide has inspired you to begin delving into the glorious art of jewelry crafting. With just these few basics in mind, anyone can start their journey to become a true artisan. And on that note, I wish you the best of luck with your endeavors!"}

The Blessing of &lt;a href=\"Veloth\"&gt;Veloth&lt;/a&gt; should protect them, but can they return from the dead?\nWalkthrough.\n&lt;a href=\"Aspera%20the%20Forgotten\"&gt;Aspera the Forgotten&lt;/a&gt; informs the Vestige that Vox's warhammer, \"&lt;a href=\"Judgement%20of%20Veloth%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Judgement of Veloth&lt;/a&gt;,\" imprisons the &lt;a href=\"souls\"&gt;souls&lt;/a&gt; of those she slays and grants Vox almost divine power. To challenge Vox, those souls need to be set free. Aspera says the Vestige must die by the hammer and collapse Vox's realm from within. Thankfully, Veloth's Blessing will serve as the Vestige's connection to the world, protecting them from true harm.\nWith no other choice, the Vestige journeys to confront Magistrix Vox in &lt;a href=\"Eidolon%27s%20Hollow\"&gt;Eidolon's Hollow&lt;/a&gt;. Vox tells the Vestige she is interested in making them into a fine ally. The Vestige can choose to listen to Vox's offer or reject her outright. Either way, they are attacked and seemingly killed by Vox using the hammer.\nThe Vestige wakes up to find themselves in the Reservoir of Souls, where Vox keeps victims of her hammer imprisoned. The Vestige will meet three individuals: &lt;a href=\"Meram%20Vox\"&gt;Meram Vox&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Priest%20Malvari\"&gt;Priest Malvari&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Ordinator%20Da%27ravis\"&gt;Ordinator Da'ravis&lt;/a&gt;, all of whom the Vestige is instructed to speak to.\nThe three souls reveal they are trapped there by an entity called the Keeper. Ordinator Da'ravis advises to shatter the orbs of ruin the Keeper seems to feed from. Priest Malvari says there is a puzzle consisting of two keys that rotate in a pattern around two locks on the flagstones. According to the Keeper, the two keys must be in both locks at the same time in order to free the priest's soul.\nOn the eastern dais, the Vestige will discover the two keys take the shape of bright orbs of light and the locks appear as white markings on the ground. The Vestige must ensure the two keys hover above each of the locks at the same time by hitting the key that needs to be slowed down. Once the puzzle has been completed, a single bright orb will travel over to Priest Malvari and free her of her bindings.\nOn the western dais, the Vestige will encounter the Keeper. The Vestige can attack and kill the Keeper directly, or destroy the orbs the Keeper is attached to to make the fight easier. After the battle, another bright orb will travel over to Ordinator Da'ravis and free him of his bindings.\nAs for Meram, he was not bound to the realm like the other two. According to the Keeper, its master wanted Meram to decide for himself what he wanted to do once his memories returned. It is up to the Vestige to remind Meram of his past, both as a fanatic Daedric worshiper and as an enemy of the Tribunal. After remembering his past, Meram decides to ally with the Vestige against his mother and opens a portal to his mother's domain.\nOn the other side of the portal, the Vestige must fight through several Banekin and Ogrim while traveling to three soul wells that need to be destroyed. Once this is done, Magistrix Vox herself will appear and fight the Vestige.\nOnce Vox is defeated, numerous souls will appear in the room, only a few of the total number of souls imprisoned by Vox. Almalexia will also appear to inform the Vestige that the Tribunal's will prevails and they can now work to restore order in Morrowind. &lt;a href=\"Almalexia%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Almalexia&lt;/a&gt; tells the Vestige it is time for them to move on."}

Of these, perhaps the most famous and well-remembered artifact remains the Judgment of Saint Veloth. This mighty &lt;a href=\"Veloth%27s%20Judgment\"&gt;Daedric warhammer&lt;/a&gt; stands as a shining symbol of everything Veloth embodies as the patron saint of outcasts and seekers of spiritual knowledge.\nStored with other holy artifacts in the protected vaults of the &lt;a href=\"Tribunal%20Temple%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Tribunal Temple&lt;/a&gt;, the Judgment of Saint Veloth served the prophet and mystic well in life, but has gained legendary powers since his ascension to sainthood. &lt;a href=\"Tribunal%20%28Online%29\"&gt;The God-Kings&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"Morrowind%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Morrowind&lt;/a&gt; watch over the relics, keeping them ready for the day when their powers would be needed in defense of the realm.\nSaint Veloth personifies daring, and those who follow the lessons of his life and teachings learn boldness and cultivate an adventurous outlook. He defined the difference between good and evil &lt;a href=\"Daedra\"&gt;Daedra&lt;/a&gt;, and even negotiated the original arrangements with the good &lt;a href=\"Daedric%20Princes\"&gt;Daedric Princes&lt;/a&gt;. This ability to distinguish the good from the bad was a hallmark of the living saint, as was his penchant for healing and healing items. Both of these aspects combined into his personal symbol of power, the warhammer known as Judgment.\nVeloth's Judgment rang with authority throughout the land, using its enchantments to cleanse corruption from the souls of those it struck down. It was a weapon, of that there can be no doubt. But Veloth was able to wield it with the same precision that a surgeon uses to wield a scalpel, removing the corruption from a soul and leaving the remainder alive and healthy. The warhammer stored the corruption for a time, turning it into energy that could be used by the wielder to enhance the power of the weapon.\nOf course, in the wrong hands such a powerful artifact could accomplish more harm than good. For this reason, among many others, the Tribunal keeps the Judgment and other artifacts locked away. It has been suggested that instead of being used as an instrument of healing, the Judgment could be used to siphon a living creature's entire soul, thus making the wielder infinitely more powerful. This conjecture has never been put into practice, and if the Tribunal has its way, it never will."}

The other three are located throughout Solstheim, one by a chest inside &lt;a href=\"Nchardak%23Nchardak%20Aqueduct\"&gt;Nchardak Aqueduct&lt;/a&gt;, one by the &lt;a href=\"Visage%20of%20Mzund\"&gt;Visage of Mzund&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Fahlbtharz\"&gt;Fahlbtharz&lt;/a&gt;, and another sold by &lt;a href=\"Revus%20Sarvani\"&gt;Revus Sarvani&lt;/a&gt; by the &lt;a href=\"Dusty%20the%20Silt%20Strider\"&gt;silt strider&lt;/a&gt; near &lt;a href=\"Tel%20Mithryn\"&gt;Tel Mithryn&lt;/a&gt;. Sarvani's gem can also be &lt;a href=\"Pickpocket\"&gt;pickpocketed&lt;/a&gt; or looted from his corpse.\nFirst pattern.\nAfter proceeding into Kagrumez, the Dragonborn will open the door to and enter the main chamber where there will be three reavers talking to themselves, with one saying \"\"Maybe we should come back with more men. We don't know how many of those things will come out.\" Another will reply \"Nonsense. A few Dwemer Spiders will pop out, we kill them, and the Treasure of Kagrumez will be ours!\"\" The reavers must be killed to begin the gauntlet.\nUpon the puzzle pedestal are nine slots in which the gems may be inserted. To the left of the front of the pedestal is a locked door and a pattern featuring two of the nine circles glowing, and this pattern must be replicated on the pedestal to open the door. Once a gem has been placed in the center-left and bottom-right slots, the floors and walls of the chamber will shift and deploy &lt;a href=\"Dwemer\"&gt;Dwemer&lt;/a&gt; automatons that must be destroyed. After the automatons have been destroyed the locked door will open and, inside the next chamber, a lever will deploy a friendly &lt;a href=\"Steadfast%20Dwarven%20Spider\"&gt;Steadfast Dwarven Spider&lt;/a&gt; that can act as a companion for the Dragonborn and behave like any other pet.\nSecond pattern.\nIn the same room as the Steadfast Dwarven Spider will be a second locked door with a puzzle featuring three glowing indicators for the placement of the gems. Return to the pedestal in the main chamber and place the gems appropriately: one in the top-center slot, one in the bottom-center slot, and one in the bottom-right slot. Once the gems have been correctly entered, the floors and walls of the chamber will again shift and deploy Dwemer automatons. The automatons will be more numerous and powerful and are accompanies by &lt;a href=\"Fire%20Damage%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;fire&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Traps%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;traps&lt;/a&gt;. After the automatons have been destroyed, the traps will deactivate and the second door will open. Inside the next room will be a lever to deploy a &lt;a href=\"Steadfast%20Dwarven%20Sphere\"&gt;Steadfast Dwarven Sphere&lt;/a&gt; which, like the spider, will act as a pet. The Dragonborn cannot have both the sphere and the spider following as pets, only one at a time.\nThird pattern.\nOn the locked door in the second room will be the pattern to open it on the puzzle pedestal. The final round of automatons will deploy when four of the gems have been inserted into the top-left, bottom-left, center, and bottom-right positions. When the chamber has rearranged itself, much of it will covered in a shallow pool of water that is electrified and will deal &lt;a href=\"Shock%20Damage%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;shock damage&lt;/a&gt;. The water can be avoided by staying on one of the several platforms above the water. The Dragonborn can used ranged attacks to dispatch the automatons on other platforms or engage in melee after moving to the other platforms by taking the damage or using &lt;a href=\"Whirlwind%20Sprint\"&gt;Whirlwind Sprint&lt;/a&gt;. Once all of the automatons have been defeated, the room will return to normal and the third and final door will be open. In the final room is an assortment of loot and a unique bow, the &lt;a href=\"Dwarven%20Black%20Bow%20of%20Fate\"&gt;Dwarven Black Bow of Fate&lt;/a&gt;. A passageway in the room serves as a quick exit from a balcony above the main chamber."}

Originally a militia group founded to destroy the remnants of the Mythic Dawn, the group was renamed after discovering the legendary artifact of &lt;a href=\"Mehrunes%20Dagon\"&gt;Mehrunes Dagon&lt;/a&gt; that became their namesake. How they found the &lt;a href=\"Mehrunes%27%20Razor%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Razor&lt;/a&gt; is a secret that I have been unable to uncover, but it is clear that they were not part of &lt;a href=\"Frathen%20Drothan\"&gt;Frathen Drothan&lt;/a&gt;'s failed expedition to &lt;a href=\"Varsa%20Baalim\"&gt;Varsa Baalim&lt;/a&gt;, and in fact the group does not first appear in &lt;a href=\"Imperial\"&gt;Imperial&lt;/a&gt; records until fifty years later.\nThe Razor was divided among the three highest ranking members of the order's inner circle, to be passed down from oldest child to oldest child \"until the twin moons themselves disappeared from the skies.\" Although this pledge seems to have been loosely interpreted, as the heavens during &lt;a href=\"Void%20Nights\"&gt;The Void Nights&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"4E%2098\"&gt;4E98&lt;/a&gt;-&lt;a href=\"4E%20100\"&gt;4E100&lt;/a&gt;, yet the &lt;a href=\"Mehrunes%27%20Razor%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Razor&lt;/a&gt;'s pieces were still being bequeathed through the generations during and after this time.\nTracing the lineages of the inner circle proved especially difficult thanks to the group's unusual membership. While the leader of the &lt;a href=\"Keepers%20of%20the%20Razor\"&gt;Keepers of the Razor&lt;/a&gt; was a &lt;a href=\"Nord\"&gt;Nord&lt;/a&gt; and thankfully was easily researched through the clan's family histories, the other two members were an &lt;a href=\"Orc\"&gt;Orc&lt;/a&gt; and a native daughter of the &lt;a href=\"The%20Reach\"&gt;Reach&lt;/a&gt;, whose paucity of respect for literacy make tracking them down less straightforward. Fortunately, Othmash gro-Gularz and his sons are well-recorded for their service in the &lt;a href=\"Imperial%20Legion%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Imperial Legion&lt;/a&gt;. Yet the daughters of Sorcha proved nearly impossible to find until I uncovered &lt;a href=\"Markarth%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Markarth&lt;/a&gt;'s meticulously thorough tax records, which recorded each birth of Sorcha's kin in order to administer certain petty fees. current , &lt;a href=\"Drascua\"&gt;Drascua&lt;/a&gt;, fled to &lt;a href=\"Dead%20Crone%20Rock\"&gt;Dead Crone Rock&lt;/a&gt; after the &lt;a href=\"Markarth%20Incident\"&gt;Markarth Incident&lt;/a&gt;, and is considered by the &lt;a href=\"Jarl\"&gt;Jarl&lt;/a&gt; to be a major threat to the safety of the hold."}

Once the &lt;a href=\"Hero%20of%20Kvatch\"&gt;Hero&lt;/a&gt; talks to him, he'll outline his predicament: creatures have driven him and his two sons from their farm outside of Chorrol, and the Town Guards offers no help.\nHis two sons, &lt;a href=\"Rallus%20Odiil\"&gt;Rallus Odiil&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Antus%20Odiil\"&gt;Antus Odiil&lt;/a&gt;, have taken it upon themselves to drive off the creatures, and Vallus Odiil fears for their lives.

Travel to Weynon Priory and look for two men standing on the road. Talk to them and they will go to their farm, which is just down the road southeast of the Priory. Upon reaching the farm, the Hero should go to the crop field and wait for the attack. After about a half a minute goblins will come rushing out in groups of three to five and attack.\nThere are three waves of goblins, and they become progressively harder, though they aren't leveled. Slay all the goblins to finish the task. The magnitude of success depends on whether or not the two sons survive the fight.\nReturn to Chorrol and meet the father to complete the quest. If both of his sons are slain, the reward is a mere pittance of the maximum potential since he has the burden of two burial expenses to deal with. If only one son was killed, the gold reward is a little higher since the aftermath's cost is a bit less.\nBut if both sons survive, the father is elated and rewards the Hero with an enchanted glass shortsword called &lt;a href=\"Chillrend%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;Chillrend&lt;/a&gt;, declaring that he has no further use for such a weapon due to his happy retirement into a life of peaceful farming."}

I need to find a way to stop them.\"\nWalkthrough.\nUpon returning to &lt;a href=\"Orsinium%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Orsinium&lt;/a&gt; after completing \"&lt;a href=\"The%20Anger%20of%20a%20King\"&gt;The Anger of a King&lt;/a&gt;,\" you will find &lt;a href=\"Mulzah\"&gt;Mulzah&lt;/a&gt; locked out of her own inn. Soldiers are guarding every exit, including the secret one, so that they can get to &lt;a href=\"Chief%20Bazrag\"&gt;Chief Bazrag&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Eveli%20Sharp-Arrow\"&gt;Eveli Sharp-Arrow&lt;/a&gt;. Mulzah will tell you that the guard in charge is currently stationed near the northwest gate, and that a man named &lt;a href=\"Sergeant%20Vulmon\"&gt;Sergeant Vulmon&lt;/a&gt;, stationed at &lt;a href=\"The%20King%27s%20Cornerclub\"&gt;The King's Cornerclub&lt;/a&gt;, took her keys. \nYou can go to either one of these places to get the keys to the inn. If you go after Sergeant Vulmon, . If you go to the guard captain's location on the walls by the northwest gate, you will find that she is Vosh Rakh. Kill her, then take the key from a backpack behind some crates. \nOnce you have the key, head back to &lt;a href=\"The%20Greedy%20Gut\"&gt;The Greedy Gut&lt;/a&gt; to free your friends. At this point, the quest will diverge depending on whether you sacrificed &lt;a href=\"Talviah%20Aliaria\"&gt;Talviah Aliaria&lt;/a&gt; in the previous quest.\nTalviah was sacrificed.\nYou will find that they have successfully defended themselves against their attackers; talk to Chief Bazrag. He will tell you that Solgra is not here because she does not have a bounty on her head, and will tell you to go warn &lt;a href=\"Kurog%20gro-Bagrakh\"&gt;King Kurog&lt;/a&gt; about what is going to happen at the moot. \nHead to Scarp Keep. You can find Kurog on the top floor with the other chiefs. When you warn him, he will tell you to continue this discussion downstairs in the dining hall, so as to not needlessly spook the chiefs. Head down there and you will find an apparition of &lt;a href=\"Forge-Mother%20Alga\"&gt;Forge-Mother Alga&lt;/a&gt; there. She will tell you that you are too late and all the pieces are in place for the grand plan. She will cast a spell on you that will knock you unconscious, but just before the screen goes black, Kurog will voice his approval of this. \nWhen you wake up, you will find yourself with Chief Bazrag in the basement of Scarp Keep. He will tell you that you were near death when he found you, and that the chiefs are heading to the Moot, on the cliffs overlooking the city. He will ask you to head that way while he gathers allies in the city. A path to the moot can be found through the throne room; head up to the top floor of scarp keep and into said room. Here, you will have to face off against &lt;a href=\"Shield-Wife%20Razbela\"&gt;Shield-Wife Razbela&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Shield-Wife%20Oshgana\"&gt;Shield-Wife Oshgana&lt;/a&gt;. Once they are dead, examine the document lying on the throne titled \"&lt;a href=\"The%20King%27s%20Orders\"&gt;The King's Orders&lt;/a&gt;\". It will mention sealing all the paths to the moot and taking care of Solgra, but it will also mention a path to the moot through the temple that has not been sealed yet.\nBring this note to Bazrag, who will be just outside, on the platform above the &lt;a href=\"Orsinium%20Outlaws%20Refuge\"&gt;Orsinium Outlaws Refuge&lt;/a&gt;. Tell him everything to finish the quest and start the next one, \"&lt;a href=\"Blood%20on%20a%20King%27s%20Hands\"&gt;Blood on a King's Hands&lt;/a&gt;.\""}

Nowhere is this more apparent than in the curious phenomenon of the Breton knightly orders.\nHere in &lt;a href=\"Hammerfell%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Hammerfell&lt;/a&gt;, we &lt;a href=\"Redguards%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Redguards&lt;/a&gt; sensibly award equal citizenship to every man or woman who knows which end of the sword to grasp. Oh, we have our governing class, of course, as civilization must be ordered and maintained, but below this aristocracy there are few distinctions.\nNot so in High Rock, where everyone is aware of their degree of nobility, which is invariably traced back to those Breton families who led the region's liberation from the overlordship of the &lt;a href=\"Direnni%20Clan\"&gt;Direnni Elves&lt;/a&gt;. High Rock cultural history is founded on tales of the noble and chivalrous \"Breton Knights\" who flung off the yoke of their Elven masters. After these knights drove the Direnni back to &lt;a href=\"Balfiera%20Island\"&gt;Balfiera Island&lt;/a&gt;, they founded the knightly orders to carry on the tradition of nobles-in-arms, and to ensure that High Rock would have able and ready defenders in times of trouble.\nSo the stories go, at least. Today, every petty kingdom and duchy in High Rock has its own knightly order, with traditions that supposedly date back to the glory days of the Breton Liberation. The &lt;a href=\"Knights%20of%20the%20Dragon%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Knights of the Dragon&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Daggerfall%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Daggerfall&lt;/a&gt;, the Knights of the Flame in &lt;a href=\"Alcaire%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Alcaire&lt;/a&gt;, the Order of Saint Pelin in &lt;a href=\"Evermore%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Evermore&lt;/a&gt;\u2014the list goes on and on.\nAnd what, nowadays, do these knightly orders do to justify their gleaming greatswords and shining mail? If we look beyond the banners and pageantry, we find that the chivalric orders fulfill two main purposes in High Rock society.\nFirst, they provide an acceptably \"noble\" calling for the excess sons and daughters of the aristocracy. Over time, as trade has made High Rock prosperous, the profession of merchant has become an accepted alternative to feudal lordship for the children of the nobility, but frankly, not every baron's son has a head for numbers and negotiation. For these spare heirs, there's always a membership available in the local knightly order.\nSecond, the bestowal of a knighthood on a lower-class man or woman is a convenient way to reward outstanding contributions to society (or to the elevating lord), and confers a measure of that nobility so prized in Breton society. Where the commoner is rewarded for achievements other than in conflict\u2014and this is the case in the majority of knighthoods\u2014the membership in the local knightly order is only nominal, and the new sir or dame is not expected to take up sword and shield. However, if their achievements were in the all-important realm of trade, the new \"merchant knight\" is expected to contribute heavily and regularly to the order's financial maintenance.\nSo if you're visiting Wayrest or Evermore on a mission of diplomacy or trade, don't be surprised if the head of a shipping company is introduced as Sir Doric, or the owner of a string of hostels is called Dame Lizabette. You're simply meeting one of the fabled Breton Knights of High Rock."}

{"id": "11073", "revid": "38800949", "url": "https://elderscrolls.fandom.com/wiki?curid=11073", "title": "The Knights of the Nine (Book)", "text": "The Knights of the Nine is a &lt;a href=\"book\"&gt;book&lt;/a&gt; in and .\nContents.\nFew people now remember the &lt;a href=\"Knights%20of%20the%20Nine%20%28Faction%29\"&gt;Knights of the Nine&lt;/a&gt;, but in their time, they were famous throughout &lt;a href=\"Cyrodiil\"&gt;Cyrodiil&lt;/a&gt;-- indeed, throughout the Empire. For a brief period in the early days of the &lt;a href=\"Septim%20Empire\"&gt;Septim Empire&lt;/a&gt;, their adventures were the talk of the land. But their renown, as with so much else, was swallowed up by the &lt;a href=\"War%20of%20the%20Red%20Diamond\"&gt;War of the Red Diamond&lt;/a&gt;, and today even the location of their priory house has been lost to history.\nThe Knights were founded by &lt;a href=\"Sir%20Amiel%20Lannus\"&gt;Sir Amiel Lannus&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"3E%20111\"&gt;3E 111&lt;/a&gt;, following his heroic turn in the &lt;a href=\"War%20of%20the%20Isle\"&gt;War of the Isle&lt;/a&gt;, with the high purpose of recovering the legendary &lt;a href=\"Crusader%27s%20Relics\"&gt;Crusader's Relics&lt;/a&gt;, the weapons and armor of &lt;a href=\"Pelinal%20Whitestrake\"&gt;Pelinal Whitestrake&lt;/a&gt; which have been lost for thousands of years. They were born out of the sense of optimism and ambition that characterised the first century of the &lt;a href=\"Third%20Era\"&gt;Third Era&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href=\"Tamriel\"&gt;Tamriel&lt;/a&gt; was united and at peace for the first time in many centuries. Nothing was impossible.\nThe fame of the knights was established early on when Sir Amiel led them against the &lt;a href=\"Wyrm%20of%20Elynglenn\"&gt;Wyrm of Elynglenn&lt;/a&gt; to recover the Cuirass of the Crusader, which had not been seen since the &lt;a href=\"First%20Era\"&gt;First Era&lt;/a&gt;. Soon, the greatest knights of the day were lining up to join the new order, and the &lt;a href=\"Priory%20of%20the%20Nine%20%28Location%29\"&gt;Priory of the Nine&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;a href=\"West%20Weald\"&gt;West Weald&lt;/a&gt; of Cyrodiil became a magnet for the great and the good. The Knights were the toast of the Empire. When &lt;a href=\"Berich%20Vlindrel\"&gt;Berich Vlindrel&lt;/a&gt; joined the order, the scion of one of the great noble families of Colovia, it was clear that the Knights of the Nine had become the Empire's most prestigious knightly order. In relatively short order, the Knights reclaimed three more Relics, and their fame soared to new heights with each one. No one doubted that they would eventually succeed in their quest to recover all eight Relics.\nSadly, this early promise of the Knights did not survive the ravages of the War of the Red Diamond, which tore apart the Empire beginning in &lt;a href=\"3E%20121\"&gt;3E 121&lt;/a&gt;. At first, it seems that Sir Amiel was able to keep his knights out of the war. But the very success of the Knights undermined this, as many of the Knights came from important families from across the Empire which were lining up on either side of the bloody civil war. Sir Berich was apparently the first to leave the Order to join the war on the side of &lt;a href=\"Cephorus\"&gt;Cephorus&lt;/a&gt;, carrying the Sword and Greaves of the Crusader into battle with him. Many other knights seem to have left the Order shortly after this, some joining the war on one side or the other.\nThe end of the order was as ignominious as its beginning was glorious. Following the victory of Cephorus in &lt;a href=\"3E%20127\"&gt;3E 127&lt;/a&gt;, Berich Vlindrel became an important figure on the winning side. It seems likely that he was behind the Imperial decree which officially dissolved the Knights of the Nine in &lt;a href=\"3E%20131\"&gt;3E 131&lt;/a&gt;, although in truth this was little more than a formality\u2014despite Sir Amiel's best efforts, the order had never recovered from the bitterness of the civil war.\nWhat happened to the various Relics originally recovered by the Knights of the Nine? The &lt;a href=\"Sword%20of%20the%20Crusader\"&gt;Sword&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Greaves%20of%20the%20Crusader\"&gt;Greaves&lt;/a&gt; went with Sir Berich, but where he bestowed them is unknown. The &lt;a href=\"Gauntlets%20of%20the%20Crusader\"&gt;Gauntlets&lt;/a&gt; famously lie immovable on the floor of the Chapel of &lt;a href=\"Stendarr\"&gt;Stendarr&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Chorrol\"&gt;Chorrol&lt;/a&gt;, where Sir Casimir left them after his disgraceful murder of a beggar in &lt;a href=\"3E%20139\"&gt;3E 139&lt;/a&gt;. The location of the Cuirass is a mystery, lost to history along with the eventual fate of Sir Amiel, who was last reported still living alone in the empty Priory of the Nine by a passing traveler in &lt;a href=\"3E%20150\"&gt;3E 150&lt;/a&gt;. And so the Knights of the Nine faded away into history."}

Then find Kalhot and talk to him. He is standing near to a room full of traps and have been watching to see how they works. Tell him to get back to the others after asking him more about the traps. Each trap fires, after that there is a moment to disarm it. During this moment they need to defeat a guardian.\nHe is glad the others are safe and will go back to them in a moment after he is had a rest. He will also let Sir Landis know the Vestige has found the remaining knights. Be careful as Angof is not like anything anyone faced."}

They will reveal that Ma'zaddha meets with a &lt;a href=\"Dark%20Seducer%20%28Shivering%20Isles%29\"&gt;Dark Seducer&lt;/a&gt; named &lt;a href=\"Nelrene\"&gt;Nelrene&lt;/a&gt; late at night.\nAt this point one will need to use caution to avoid being discovered. Do not speak to Nelrene or Ma'zaddha, just stay in the shadows and follow one of them. They meet near the sewer grate in the southwest part of Crucible, just below &lt;a href=\"Brithaur%27s%20House\"&gt;Brithaur's House&lt;/a&gt;, at about 2:30\u20132:45 a.m. If the Hero is discovered in the process, they must wait until 2:30 a.m again; hiding between the two basements close to their meeting is one potential spot to remain unseen. During this conversation, one will overhear them discussing a plot to kill Lady Syl, and wait until the conversation is finished, then confront Ma'zaddha. No matter what is said to him, he will agree to provide a list of names of others that are involved if they meet him at his house tomorrow at midnight.\nFind and speak to Nelrene and if she is tortured three times she will reveal that the leader is &lt;a href=\"Muurine\"&gt;Muurine&lt;/a&gt;, who will say nothing without more evidence. This step may be skipped if they got the evidence and speak to her.\nReturning to &lt;a href=\"Ma%27zaddha%27s%20House\"&gt;Ma'zaddha's House&lt;/a&gt; at midnight, the Hero will find him dead on the floor. Search his body to find a key to his cupboard found on the second floor. It contains &lt;a href=\"Nelrene%27s%20Ceremonial%20Shortsword\"&gt;Nelrene's Ceremonial Shortsword&lt;/a&gt; and a &lt;a href=\"Ma%27zaddha%27s%20Crinkled%20Note\"&gt;crumpled note&lt;/a&gt;. The notes says that Ma'zaddha tried to get Anya to murder Lady Syl with Nerlene's sword, but she refused, so he held onto the sword as evidence. The sword and note are enough to confront Muurine.\nGo back to Muurine and she will finally confess and tell them to go and tell Lady Syl, like the tattletale they are.\nGo back and talk to Lady Syl and she will send for Muurine and orders to meet her in the torture chamber right away. In the torture chamber, Muurine is locked in a cage and when Lady Syl enters she sentences Muurine to death with execution to be carried out immediately. Lady Syl presses a button and two statues on either side of Muurine's cage shower her with lightning, killing her instantly.\nLady Syl then tells the Hero that they will be rewarded by sparing their life and also bestows the title of \"Courtier of Dementia\" and the bow &lt;a href=\"Ruin%27s%20Edge\"&gt;Ruin's Edge&lt;/a&gt;, which casts a random spell on strike."}

The clanging of armor, the thrill of victory, the mud and sweat and sting of defeat. And, of course, the beautiful clink of gold coins. Nothing in the whole of &lt;a href=\"Tamriel\"&gt;Tamriel&lt;/a&gt; competes. I do fancy myself something of connoisseur when it comes to this most noble sport, and I've developed favorite fighting styles, too. No warrior impresses me more than the one who charged into the battle with a weapon in each hand\u2014sure in their skill, coordinated beyond belief, and unafraid of the enemy's attacks. None better represent the true spirit of the arena.\nAs a frequent attendee and bettor of large sums, I've had the privilege of meeting many of my favored champions, and I've collected their quotes on this most illustrious fighting style. I wish to share them with the world that others might be inspired to take up two weapons and charge to their destinies, and hopefully into my local arena!\n\"Most people only train with a weapon in one hand or use two-handers. To train yourself to fight with two weapons, you have to focus on your off hand. Force yourself to practice and spar with it alone for a while so you catch it up. It takes a long time to learn, and it's easy to give up because that arm will start out so weak, but if you keep it up, you'll be whirling around the pit in no time!\" \u2014 The Maelstrom\n\"Milira was a juggler before she came to the arena. Already knew how to handle many daggers. Better money here, so &lt;a href=\"Khajiit%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Khajiit&lt;/a&gt; stays.\" \u2014 Milira\n\"It's all about speed. Two light weapons and quick feet. You need more than just fast attacks, you need to be able to predict your opponent's movw, show up where he least expects you, run circles around him, and call him names. If you can frustrate your challenger, you gain an even better advantage.\" \u2014 \"Heartstriker\" Goranion\n\"Growing up, I had twin sisters. Little brats! They were constantly pestering me, trying to 'pretty up' my hair and drag me off to play tea party! I had to learn how to keep both at bay early on, and, you know, I guess that's where it all started. When I got into training, it just felt normal to have a weapon in each hand. So, uh, start early, I guss.\" \u2014 Myl \"Mutilator\" Drothro\n\"Well, you don't have a shield, but you can learn to parry and even sort of block with two weapons. It's the best style for disarming the other guy, that's for sure. That's why I like it. Send his weapon flying and then what, right?\" \u2014 The Decimator\n\"Well, it's something I certainly have a lot to say about\u2014so much so that I've written a book! You can find a copy at most of the local booksellers, ask for 'Fighting to Survive and Surviving to Fight: the Definitive Guide to Two-Weapon Combat'! Tell 'em I sent ya for a discount!\" \u2014 Todir the Tower"}

In &lt;a href=\"1E%20808\"&gt;1E 808&lt;/a&gt;, they &lt;a href=\"Ra%20Gada%20Invasion\"&gt;arrived&lt;/a&gt; in the western region of &lt;a href=\"Tamriel\"&gt;Tamriel&lt;/a&gt; known as &lt;a href=\"Volenfell\"&gt;Volenfell&lt;/a&gt;, and soon conquered the land from the &lt;a href=\"Orsimer\"&gt;Orsimer&lt;/a&gt; and renamed it to &lt;a href=\"Hammerfell\"&gt;Hammerfell&lt;/a&gt;.\u00a0They also defeated the &lt;a href=\"Nede\"&gt;Nede&lt;/a&gt;s when their ships first crashed in Tamriel and battled Giant Goblins for territory. They later became known as the &lt;a href=\"Redguards\"&gt;Redguards&lt;/a&gt;.\nHistory.\n&lt;a href=\"First%20Era\"&gt;First Era&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe Ra Gada, \"Warrior Wave,\" came to &lt;a href=\"Tamriel\"&gt;Tamriel&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"1E%20808\"&gt;1E 808&lt;/a&gt;, The Second Wave was known as the Tavan Wave, and settled in most of Southern Hammerfell. The Ra Gada came to conquer land for the old king of &lt;a href=\"Yokuda\"&gt;Yokuda&lt;/a&gt;, slaying the native &lt;a href=\"Orc\"&gt;Orc&lt;/a&gt;s in the process. Some of the most fearsom of the Ra Gada were the &lt;a href=\"Anka-Ra\"&gt;Anka-Ra&lt;/a&gt;, led by &lt;a href=\"Emperor%20Tarish-Zi\"&gt;Emperor Tarish-Zi&lt;/a&gt;, they were among the strongest of the Ra Gada, and renowned by their own people. It is said that one group of Ra Gada, known as the Glinting Talons, used a very fierce and powerful fighting style, while dual-wielding swords, their enemies were sometimes killed before they knew they were attacked. It is said that these Talons worshipped both &lt;a href=\"Tava\"&gt;Tava&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Diagna\"&gt;Diagna&lt;/a&gt;, which would explain their strength. One of the people these Talons, alongside the rest of the Ra Gada, attacked were the Orcs. It is said that the Ra Gada conqeured Hammerfell in only a few battles, presumably due to the lack of any civilisations for the past hundreds of years prior to their arrival. Many Orcs would eventually flee Hammerfell, and join the armies of &lt;a href=\"Orsinium\"&gt;Orsinium&lt;/a&gt;, until Orsinium got destroyed by the &lt;a href=\"Order%20of%20Diagna\"&gt;Order of Diagna&lt;/a&gt;, combined with the Kingdoms of &lt;a href=\"High%20Rock\"&gt;High Rock&lt;/a&gt;, mainly &lt;a href=\"Daggerfall\"&gt;Daggerfall&lt;/a&gt;. One of the warmounts the Ra Gada used were chariots. When the Ra Gada tried to push into High Rock, the &lt;a href=\"Direnni\"&gt;Direnni&lt;/a&gt; pushed them back, either through naval power, or water magic.\nAfter the Orsimer were removed from Hammerfell, the Redguards started to build and work the land. One of these cities was Ojwambu, a prosperous city with the last &lt;a href=\"Ansei\"&gt;Ansei&lt;/a&gt;, Hallin, located within. A tribe of Goblin's located near the mountains had not forgotten that they were pushed out, and attacked the city by the command of the Goblin Mahgzoor Rockhand, as a result the Last Ansei spread his knowledge to the rest of the population, who in turn had to teach it to the rest of Hammerfell. When the Goblins wanted to besiege the city, the Gods had brought back all the Ansei that ever were, to defend the city. When the news reached the Goblin king, he was hesitant to call for the attack, but since he had a huge army, he decided to truly besiege the city. A long time had passed, and the city would have been without rations according to the knowledge of the Goblins, so shamans were called for to check if the Ansei were truly warriors or merely shades. When Mahgzoor learned that it were actual humans, he decided to charge the city with his Goblin horde. After a seventeen-day lasting assault, the city was conqeured by the Goblins, with Mahgzoor and Hallin having killed one another in a duel. When the former Queen of Ojwambu heard of the defeat, she rallied the Redguards who her citizens had taught the arts of war, and retook the city, which she renamed &lt;a href=\"Hallin%27s%20Stand\"&gt;Hallin's Stand&lt;/a&gt;.\nEventually, as time passed on, the Ra Gada would turn into &lt;a href=\"the%20Forebears\"&gt;the Forebears&lt;/a&gt;, one of Hammerfell's political and militaristic factions."}

Some races are more similar than others, while some are vastly different. Each race falls into three different subcategories: &lt;a href=\"beastfolk\"&gt;beastfolk&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"human\"&gt;human&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"mer\"&gt;mer&lt;/a&gt;. Of all the races in , there are ten playable races open to the &lt;a href=\"Hero%20of%20Kvatch\"&gt;Hero of Kvatch&lt;/a&gt;, the game's protagonist. Most characters fall into one of these races. &lt;a href=\"Dremora%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;Dremora&lt;/a&gt; are abundant in \"Oblivion\", although almost entirely hostile. Several extinct races are mentioned in \"Oblivion\"'s &lt;a href=\"lore\"&gt;lore&lt;/a&gt;.\nComparisons with other games.\nThere have been 10 playable races in every Elder Scrolls game except and , where &lt;a href=\"Imperials%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;Imperials&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Orsimer%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;Orcs&lt;/a&gt; were not a playable race. Because \"Oblivion\" is partially set in the &lt;a href=\"Oblivion%20%28Realm%29\"&gt;realms of Oblivion&lt;/a&gt;, more &lt;a href=\"Dremora%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;Dremora&lt;/a&gt; are encountered than in previous titles, where they are merely &lt;a href=\"Summon%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;summoned&lt;/a&gt; by &lt;a href=\"Conjuration%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;Conjuration&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"magic\"&gt;magic&lt;/a&gt;. \"Oblivion\" is also the first title to depict female Dremora. Unlike and like , beastfolk may wear boots and helmets.\nImpact on character creation.\nUpon selecting a race, certain bonuses and impediments are immediately counted toward the Hero's &lt;a href=\"Attributes%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;attributes&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Skills%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;skills&lt;/a&gt;. For example, &lt;a href=\"Mer\"&gt;Mer&lt;/a&gt;, or elves, excel at &lt;a href=\"magic\"&gt;magic&lt;/a&gt; while &lt;a href=\"Nords%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;Nords&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Redguards%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;Redguards&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Orsimer%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;Orsimer&lt;/a&gt; excel at &lt;a href=\"Combat%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;combat&lt;/a&gt;-oriented abilities. Each race is better suited for a different &lt;a href=\"Classes%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;class&lt;/a&gt;, although \"Oblivion\" allows for enough customization to make any race work with any class, depending on player preference. In the &lt;a href=\"Imperial%20City%20Sewers%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;Imperial City Sewers&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Baurus\"&gt;Baurus&lt;/a&gt; offers his opinion of the player's class depending on their race and the skills used during &lt;a href=\"Tutorial%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;the tutorial&lt;/a&gt;. Each race has one or more resistances and unique powers as well. All members of all races have a +5 disposition bonus to members of their own race.\nPlayable races.\n&lt;a href=\"Tamriel\"&gt;Tamriel&lt;/a&gt; is the home of all the ten main races, each occupying a different portion of the continent. The races are:\nRacial resistances and weaknesses.\nFor conciseness, weaknesses are listed as a negative number, e.g., a -25 under Fire represents 25 points of &lt;a href=\"Weakness%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;Weakness to Fire&lt;/a&gt;. Imperials and Khajiit have no special resistances or weaknesses.\nRecognizing races.\nThe race of most characters in Cyrodiil can be recognized by physical appearance. However, some characters, especially those of Breton or Imperial ancestry, are more difficult to distinguish. A character's race can be identified using &lt;a href=\"Console%20Commands%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;console commands&lt;/a&gt;: Enter the console by pressing tilde (~), click on the target character, and type: codice_1\nusing one of the following RaceIDs."}

{"id": "41728", "revid": "5133668", "url": "https://elderscrolls.fandom.com/wiki?curid=41728", "title": "Races (Skyrim)", "text": "There are ten different playable races in .

Each race starts with +10 in one &lt;a href=\"Skills%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;skill&lt;/a&gt; and +5 in five other skills. However, this doesn't mean that a race is restricted to a certain play-style, as it is possible to develop any skill over time. Unlike other games, \"Skyrim\" does not feature classes, so in character creation, the race is the only major gameplay choice that the player must make.\nPlayable races.\n&lt;a href=\"Tamriel\"&gt;Tamriel&lt;/a&gt; is the home of all the ten main races, each occupying a different portion of the continent.\nStarting skills by race.\nThe following table shows the starting skill statistics for each race. The higher the number (over the base level of 15) the better. Values of 20 indicate this is a favored skill of the race. Values of 25 indicate this is a primary skill of the race. Skills can be improved to a primary group.\nEvery race has their own unique skill which they excel at and will start at level 25 with that particular skill. For example, &lt;a href=\"Bretons%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Bretons&lt;/a&gt; start at level 25 &lt;a href=\"Conjuration%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Conjuration&lt;/a&gt; as they are naturally skilled at it.\nStarting spells by race.\nEvery race begins with &lt;a href=\"Healing\"&gt;Healing&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Flames%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Flames&lt;/a&gt;. Dunmer start with an additional &lt;a href=\"Sparks%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Sparks&lt;/a&gt;, whilst Altmer instead start with an additional &lt;a href=\"Fury%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Fury&lt;/a&gt;, and Bretons instead start with an additional &lt;a href=\"Conjure%20Familiar\"&gt;Conjure Familiar&lt;/a&gt;.\n&lt;a href=\"Survival%20Mode\"&gt;Survival Mode&lt;/a&gt;.\n The following are the additional racial effects in the &lt;a href=\"Creation%20Club\"&gt;Creation Club&lt;/a&gt; of .\nStats affected by character size.\nRace specific scales can be found in the brackets when the codice_1 command is used on the player or a non-playable character. Non-bracket value is the default 1.00 console value and are unique for each specific race, for example, Altmer 1.00 value is different from Breton 1.00 value.\nAt least walking/running speed and jump height is affected by the height value. The console command codice_2 can be used to change the height of the character. Because changing the player scale in the console increases and decreases melee damage accordingly, there is a misconception that taller races do more base melee damage.\nChanges from previous games.\nCharacter creation has been dramatically changed in . Previous games had the player choose from a list of classes that would determine the starting skills for the player's character and in some cases, how the player's character would level. The player also had the option of creating a custom class, selecting each skill individually. This system had a very large impact on player effectiveness in the beginning of the game, though \"\" system was able to lessen that impact. A player could spend hours working out the most effective way to build a character.\nIn \"Skyrim\", however, that system has been removed, meaning that though the player will still select a race, the player no longer has to select a class. Skill set specialization is still possible in Skyrim, but instead of permanently selecting this during character creation, this is now done using the skill perks earned by leveling up (both skills and player level, as perks are earned by overall level while skill level is required to select any but the most basic perks). The &lt;a href=\"birthsign\"&gt;birthsign&lt;/a&gt; system has been replaced completely with &lt;a href=\"Standing%20Stones\"&gt;Standing Stones&lt;/a&gt;, which can be changed at any time by visiting and activating a new stone.\nThe Luck attribute has also been removed and is therefore impossible to increase. Skills have been further reduced from a total of 21 to 18. There are no acrobatics/athletics or speed attributes so it is not possible to increase your jump height or your character's running speed through stats.\nIf a player maxes out all skills, the character will reach level 81, meaning there are 80 (no perk can be chosen at level 1) possible perk points to choose from, out of over 250 possible places to spend them. Previously, this was the effective level cap for the player character, however this changed with &lt;a href=\"Patches%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Patch 1.9&lt;/a&gt; and the introduction of &lt;a href=\"Skills%20%28Skyrim%29%23Legendary%20Skills\"&gt;Legendary Skills&lt;/a&gt;. Legendary skills allow the player to refund all the perk points from a single maxed out skill and set its level back to 15 (the game's starting point). Skills can be made legendary multiple times, allowing the player to level their character indefinitely.\nA typical player will not max out all skills to 100, and will instead reach only around level 50 or so. A character designed around 30 perk points is a reasonable build that can be reached in-game fairly quickly and is a great starting point for those who want to design the character before playing.\nElders.\nIn Skyrim, one of the races is called Elder. It cannot be chosen during character creation. It is solely composed of &lt;a href=\"human\"&gt;human&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Characters%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;characters&lt;/a&gt; that appear much older than most people. &lt;a href=\"Arngeir\"&gt;Arngeir&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Esbern%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Esbern&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Septimus%20Signus\"&gt;Septimus Signus&lt;/a&gt; are some of the people who are part of the Elder race.\nSnow Elves.\nThe Snow Elves are a race of &lt;a href=\"Mer\"&gt;Mer&lt;/a&gt; that cannot be chosen during character creation. During the events of , two living Snow Elves are encountered, &lt;a href=\"Knight-Paladin%20Gelebor\"&gt;Knight-Paladin Gelebor&lt;/a&gt; and his brother &lt;a href=\"Arch-Curate%20Vyrthur\"&gt;Arch-Curate Vyrthur&lt;/a&gt;. They are, physically, very similar to High Elves, except for their white skin and hair."}

According to Attrebus, she was a very beautiful woman.\nBackground.\nShe claims to be &lt;a href=\"Tralan%20%28Infernal%20City%29\"&gt;Tralan the Two-Blade's&lt;/a&gt; daughter. It is never revealed if she really was her daughter or it was only a cover to gain Attrebus' trust.\nHistory.\n&lt;a href=\"Fourth%20Era\"&gt;Fourth Era&lt;/a&gt;.\nAttrebus fights Radhasa to test her ability in combat. Attrebus easily defeats her, but her speed astonishes him. Attrebus is captivated by her beauty, and he allows her to join his personal bodyguard. &lt;a href=\"Gulan\"&gt;Gulan&lt;/a&gt; warnes Attrebus about having sexual relations with Radhasa. Attrebus inquires Gulan about the matter and he discovers the Emperor intends Attrebus to marry soon.\nWhen Attrebus decides to secretly march into &lt;a href=\"Umbriel\"&gt;Umbriel&lt;/a&gt;, he orders his men to meet him at &lt;a href=\"Ione\"&gt;Ione&lt;/a&gt;. Attrebus tells Radhasa about the founding of the city, and that he owns a hunting lodge. When everyone was ready, they began their journey into Umbriel. During the journey, suddenly half of Attrebus' men caught fire. The last thing Attrebus saw before fainting was Radhasa's blade swinging towards his head.\nWhen Attrebus wakes up, Radhasa confesses she had been paid to kill him, but she was going to sell him to a eccentric &lt;a href=\"Khajiit\"&gt;Khajiit&lt;/a&gt; who collected people like him. She also reveals to the prince he is not the mighty warrior he thinks he is, but Attrebus refuses to belive her. They marched into &lt;a href=\"Sheeraln\"&gt;Sheeraln&lt;/a&gt; in order to trade their horses for slarjei and water. During the journey they find a meandering stream, and Attrebus is forced to have a bath. Attrebus promises not to escape, and Radhasa unties Attrebus' ropes. Attrebus launches himself into his sword, &lt;a href=\"Flashing\"&gt;Flashing&lt;/a&gt;, and he fights Radhasa. Unlike in their first encounter, Radhasa easily defeats the prince. Once Attrebus surrenders, a &lt;a href=\"Dunmer\"&gt;Dunmer&lt;/a&gt; attacks Radhasa and her companions, killing them and saving the prince. The Dunmer decapitates an injured Radhasa, taking her life. The Dunmer introduces himself as &lt;a href=\"Sul\"&gt;Sul&lt;/a&gt;.\nCompanions.\nRadhasa worked with other seven criminals:"}

For example, Radiant A.I. may be used to set a &lt;a href=\"quest\"&gt;quest&lt;/a&gt; objective in a location previously undiscovered by the player and populate that location with &lt;a href=\"enemies\"&gt;enemies&lt;/a&gt; who suit the player's abilities or detail character reactions and behaviors based on past actions.\nRadiant A.I. technology has been used (although to a lesser extent) in one other game: . It has also been used in other &lt;a href=\"role-playing%20games\"&gt;role-playing games&lt;/a&gt; from &lt;a href=\"Bethesda\"&gt;Bethesda&lt;/a&gt;, such as \"&lt;a href=\"w%3Ac%3Afallout%3AFallout%203\"&gt;Fallout 3&lt;/a&gt;\" and \"&lt;a href=\"w%3Ac%3Afallout%3AFallout%3A%20New%20Vegas\"&gt;Fallout: New Vegas&lt;/a&gt;\", in which the two expanded onto it, and gave the developers the idea to expand it fully in \"Skyrim\", but to an extent; there is never a case where the player is unable to do something because of their character's &lt;a href=\"race\"&gt;race&lt;/a&gt;, class (or strong &lt;a href=\"Skills%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;skills&lt;/a&gt;, in the case of \"Skyrim\") or &lt;a href=\"birthsign\"&gt;birthsign&lt;/a&gt;.\nIn \"Skyrim\", Radiant A.I. plays a large part in , and ensures that the game is played differently every time. Characters will often converse with each other, or comment on a character's previous &lt;a href=\"Achievements%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;achievements&lt;/a&gt; or skill levels (e.g.: &lt;a href=\"Hold%20Guard\"&gt;Hold Guard&lt;/a&gt;s telling a character with a high &lt;a href=\"Pickpocket\"&gt;Pickpocket&lt;/a&gt; level to keep their hands to themselves). It also delivers &lt;a href=\"Radiant%20Quests\"&gt;Radiant Quests&lt;/a&gt; (such as rescuing a random character from a dungeon) that are tailored to the player's skill level and where they have not visited, and spawns enemies that are a good match for the player. It keeps track of your deeds, good or evil, and modifies character reactions appropriately.\nIf you commit a &lt;a href=\"Crime%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;crime&lt;/a&gt; against a character, they may send &lt;a href=\"Hired%20Thug\"&gt;Hired Thug&lt;/a&gt;s after you to \"teach you a lesson,\" or even hire a &lt;a href=\"Assassin%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Dark Brotherhood Assassin&lt;/a&gt;. If certain characters are killed, others may assume their roles (e.g.: &lt;a href=\"Ysolda\"&gt;Ysolda&lt;/a&gt; will become landlord of &lt;a href=\"The%20Bannered%20Mare\"&gt;The Bannered Mare&lt;/a&gt; if the original owner is killed). Should you drop an &lt;a href=\"Items%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;item&lt;/a&gt;, characters might ask if they can have it, or say \"Why did you do that?\" or a guard will make you bribe him to prevent a bounty being raised. Radiant A.I. also allows characters to interact with the environment around them to make the game feel less linear and more organic."}

Both women treat every customer with disdain, though Taarie at least makes an effort to be nice. Investing in the store using the &lt;a href=\"Investor\"&gt;Investor&lt;/a&gt; perk makes them somewhat less abrasive.\nBased on dialogue between &lt;a href=\"Erikur\"&gt;Erikur&lt;/a&gt; and his sister, &lt;a href=\"Gisli\"&gt;Gisli&lt;/a&gt;, Radiant Raiment is apparently owned by the former and Taarie and Endarie merely rent the establishment from him. When he complains that the sisters charge him twice as much as their other customers, Gisli retorts that it is because he keeps raising their rent.\nWares.\nAs the only clothing focused shop in &lt;a href=\"Skyrim\"&gt;Skyrim&lt;/a&gt;, they sell a wide variety of apparel that would otherwise be difficult to find.\nTheir wares range from enchanted and non-enchanted amulets, circlets, necklaces, and rings to robes, tunics, many different types of boots and hats, clothes of different design and color, and gloves. They also sell a small variety of &lt;a href=\"Child%27s%20Clothes\"&gt;children's clothes&lt;/a&gt;\u00a0if \u00a0is installed.\nSome of the items they sell, such as the &lt;a href=\"Alik%27r%20hood\"&gt;Alik'r hood&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Hammerfell%20garb\"&gt;Hammerfell garb&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"mourner%27s%20clothes\"&gt;mourner's clothes&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"mourner%27s%20hat\"&gt;mourner's hat&lt;/a&gt; cannot be bought from any other merchants.\n&lt;a href=\"Amulets%20of%20the%20Nine%20Divines\"&gt;Amulets of the Nine Divines&lt;/a&gt; can be bought here, although not all of them at the same time.\nInterior.\nBehind the counter are many different types of clothing, boots, hats, four circlets, a strongbox, a sabre cat pelt, baskets with firewood in them, a dagger, iron helmet, and a woodcutter's axe. The room to the right of the front counter holds some basic kitchen wares, food, wine and mead, and a cooking pot.\nIn the basement, there is some stored food and alchemical ingredients, barrels and a chest with misc items in it. Upstairs each bedroom has the basics, such as a bed, tables with food on them, wardrobes, and cupboards.\nThe bedroom straight across from the stairs has a &lt;a href=\"business%20ledger\"&gt;business ledger&lt;/a&gt; and a chest with misc items in it. The largest bedroom to the right of the stairs has some alchemical ingredients and coin purses. The hallway upstairs has a large bookshelf with books on it.\nHousing.\nIf the Dragonborn marries Taarie and uses the Radiant Raiment as a home, Endarie will still continue to suspiciously follow the Dragonborn everywhere in the store/home. After the marriage, everything in Raidiant Raiment will be marked as owned by the Dragonborn and free to take. Endarie will still call the guards (who will show up for arrest) if the Dragonborn is seen picking the lock on the lockbox, however.\nSafe storage after marrying Taarie is as follows: Basement \u2013 chest and cupboard are safe (will not respawn or delete items), but the three barrels are not safe (they respawn and delete stored items). Entry level \u2013 large 'store' cupboard is not safe (respawns and deletes stored items), but the small kitchen cupboard (next to the cooking pot) is safe. Upstairs \u2013 every single storage container is safe (will not respawn or delete stored items), except that the chest will respawn without deleting stored items. Respawned items are merely added to the stored inventory.\n&lt;a href=\"Irnskar%20Ironhand\"&gt;Irnskar Ironhand&lt;/a&gt; will occasionally be found wandering through the house, sitting, or eating. However, if Endarie is killed, Ironhand will manage the shop and stay at the front desk."}

Ragnvald can also be found directly southwest of the Dwarven ruin &lt;a href=\"Bthardamz%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Bthardamz&lt;/a&gt;. It is the resting place of &lt;a href=\"Otar%20the%20Mad\"&gt;Otar the Mad&lt;/a&gt;, a &lt;a href=\"Dragon%20Priests%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Dragon Priest&lt;/a&gt;. It is one of the few ruins in the Reach that the &lt;a href=\"Forsworn\"&gt;Forsworn&lt;/a&gt; do not appear in.\nWalkthrough.\nRagnvald Temple.\nThe door to the temple opens into a large area to the west. A little way ahead is a dais with a table, on which lies a draugr corpse. To the west, an arched passage leads down a set of stairs. The path turns right (north). Straight ahead is a small area with a dead draugr with some loot as well as a &lt;a href=\"Soul%20Gem%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;soul gem&lt;/a&gt; and a potion nearby.\nTo the right (east), a set of steps leads down to a T intersection. To the right (south) is a dead end with a chest. To the left (north) is a pathway just next to the stairwell (heading west), which leads farther into Ragnvald Temple. While progressing down this pathway, the sound of swinging blades, can be heard nearby. The path turns left, then right again, and leads to a walkway over a tall room. At the end of the walkway, a wooden staircase leads down to a lower level, while a path at the current level leads onwards through a pool of oil into the temple. A leveled draugr awaits in the lower level, while another patrols in the distance.\nIn the lower level, against the west wall, is a shelf with several &lt;a href=\"Alchemy%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;alchemy&lt;/a&gt; ingredients, while in the southeast corner is an alcove with a chest. In the northern wall is an opening to a path that immediately turns right. Here the swinging blades can be seen that have been heard for so long. At the other end is a draugr guard, a lever that stops the blades, a chest containing minor loot, and a potion.\nBack up at the platform, there are four pathways. The first (on the left) has a wooden ramp leading down to a second lower level area. The second (also on the left) leads across a walkway to a platform with a pool of oil, a wooden door heading east that is barred from the other side, and a door to the Ragnvald Crypts (to the south).\nThe third pathway leads right (south) across an arched walkway to another platform with a wooden door in the north wall that, again, is barred from the other side. The last path leads straight ahead (west) to a set of stairs that lead down to a third lower level section. From the bottom of the steps, straight ahead is a raised platform with a table containing two slots. Activating either one will add the miscellaneous quest \"Unlock the Sarcophagus in Ragnvald.\" Adding the quest will help find the location of the two keys to Otar's tomb. Up the steps at the west end of the room are a set of bars through which another part of the dungeon can be seen, but which cannot be opened.\nBack to the east is the rest of this lower level section. A chest and a potion are in the northwest corner. The northeast corner has a table with a soul gem and a potion.\nRagnvald Crypts.\nEntering the door to the Crypts, a path to the south leads to the upper part of a room with two identical hallways that lead south to the same place. The one on the right has a leveled draugr patrolling and the left has pressure plate activated traps. From the crypt on the other end, the path turns left (east), then left again (north). In the next main hall, four draugr of varying strengths will attack.\nThe path turns right (east), then left, left again (west), then right. At the end of that pathway is a room with a pool of oil in the middle of the floor, a booby-trapped chest at the end of the room, and two more draugr. On the table behind the trapped chest is the &lt;a href=\"Mystery%20of%20Talara%2C%20Book%20II\"&gt;Mystery of Talara, Book II&lt;/a&gt;. In the right (east) wall is an opening to a path heading upstairs to the left (north) then left again (west). The path turns left again and leads to the upper part of a large multi-level room. To the left (east) is a room with a skull on a pedestal in the middle. However, before that, note that there is a walkway leading west, then north up some stairs, and back west that returns to Rangvald Temple.\nThe large room with the skull has a raised area on the east end that holds a chest and several urns. There are two wooden ramps leading up to small areas with minor loot. Note the iron coffin in each, with a pool of oil and a lamp above next to each one.\nThe skull is actually &lt;a href=\"Saerek%27s%20Skull%20Key\"&gt;Saerek's Skull Key&lt;/a&gt;. The impending battle can be avoided by dropping a similar sized item on the pedestal before taking the skull. This way the pedestal will not activate. Otherwise, once the skull is taken off the push-plate Saerek the Guardian will break out of a coffin in front of the Dragonborn. Alternatively, the Dragonborn can stand at the top of one of the side platforms and use archery or kinetic spells to dislodge the skull. The draugr will still activate, but the Dragonborn will not be surrounded. Once he and the other two draugr are killed, the quest continues by heading back into Ragnvald Temple via the door seen before.\nRagnvald Temple.\nDirectly ahead is one of the doors that was barred, only now the door bar can be activated and the door opened. Proceeding north across the stone bridge, then across the arched walkway, around a pillar, and across another bridge is another platform. It is fine to jump off of this platform. Behind to the north is the door to the next area\u2014Ragnvald Canal.\nRagnvald Canal.\nDirectly ahead is a waterfall falling into the canal. To the right is a wooden ramp leading down into the canal. To the left is a wooden bridge with leveled draugr present. Across the first wooden bridge and to the right is a small room with a chest. Back at the first wooden bridge, dropping into the water on the right (south), then heading directly forward, next to the stone wall on the right is a lever. Pulling it will drop the bridge. A twisting pathway leads generally south to a chamber with another skull on a pedestal. At the southern end of the lower part of the room is another chest.\nThis skull is &lt;a href=\"Torsten%27s%20Skull%20Key\"&gt;Torsten's Skull Key&lt;/a&gt;. Taking it will release enemies. As with the crypts, it can be dislodged first and a stealthy Dragonborn can go up to the ring path above the path with the skull to trigger the trap and get a number of shots off before the draugr can reach them or even notice them. After defeating Guardian Torsten, up the stairs directly opposite his coffin, the bridge to the right (east) leads to steps that climb left (north), then left again (west). Directly across a pillar, a small wooden bridge leads to a novice-locked chest. To the right (north) is a pathway with a trap trigger that releases swinging blades. This pathway leads north, then turns right and back left, crossing another bridge. On the other side is a room with a novice-locked chest and an &lt;a href=\"Arcane%20Enchanter%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Arcane Enchanter&lt;/a&gt;. An opening leads to the right (east) to another bridge, up some stairs, and back into Ragnvald Temple again.\nOtar the Mad.\n The path leads to the other side of the other barred door. Through it is the coffin with two slots in it which is opened with the two skulls that have been collected. After the coffin opens, the dragon priest Otar the Mad will attack.\nAfter Otar is killed, his body contains the Dragon Priest mask &lt;a href=\"Otar%20%28Mask%29\"&gt;Otar&lt;/a&gt;. The path past his coffin (to the west) will now be opened.\nThrough the opening are a chest and several more urns. To the right (north) is an apprentice level chest in the rubble. To the left (south) is a &lt;a href=\"Word%20Walls%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;word wall&lt;/a&gt; for a word of the &lt;a href=\"Kyne%27s%20Peace\"&gt;Kyne's Peace&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"shout\"&gt;shout&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe only way to exit is all the way to the east and back out the original entrance to the temple."}

This is also a possible explanation for to his attire not being that of a normal bandit, but rather a set of &lt;a href=\"Clothes\"&gt;Clothes&lt;/a&gt; worn by most barkeepers in the game.\nHe evidently went down fighting, as evidenced by the presence of a dead &lt;a href=\"Chaurus%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Chaurus&lt;/a&gt; in the final room of Liar's Retreat.

His full name translates to \"Anger\" in the &lt;a href=\"Dragons%20%28Lore%29\"&gt;dragon&lt;/a&gt; tongue. He is the primary antagonist of the quest \"&lt;a href=\"Siege%20on%20the%20Dragon%20Cult\"&gt;Siege on the Dragon Cult&lt;/a&gt;.\"\nBackground.\nRahgot is believed to be one of the last remnants of the &lt;a href=\"Dragon%20Cult\"&gt;Dragon Cult&lt;/a&gt; around &lt;a href=\"1E%20140\"&gt;1E 140&lt;/a&gt;. He led a small cult in the secluded monastery of &lt;a href=\"Forelhost%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Forelhost&lt;/a&gt; high in the &lt;a href=\"Jerall%20Mountains\"&gt;Jerall Mountains&lt;/a&gt;.\nA legion of &lt;a href=\"Harald\"&gt;King Harald's&lt;/a&gt; soldiers, commanded by &lt;a href=\"Skorm%20Snow-Strider\"&gt;Skorm Snow-Strider&lt;/a&gt;, discovered the hidden stronghold of dragon cultists and laid siege to it for several weeks. Once the main gate had been breached, Rahgot and his followers retreated into the interior of the monastery, collapsing the main stairway to hinder access to the refectory.\nThe priest devised a plan for the cult to commit mass suicide in the main chamber, believing that if Skorm and his men did eventually break through the main door, the sight of the mass suicide would somehow deter them from searching for other survivors within the monastery and thus he would survive.\nHe ordered his alchemists to manufacture large quantities of &lt;a href=\"Deathbell%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;deathbell&lt;/a&gt; for the cultists to ingest and also poisoned their own water supply. Dissent was dealt with brutally; when Rahgot's chief alchemist questioned his orders for mass suicide, she was murdered.\nThe mass suicide was eventually carried out. Rahgot ordered the burial of the children's bodies and the remaining cultists perished in their sleep after absorbing the poison. Just as Rahgot had imagined, the aftermath horrified Skorm when he had seized the fortress, and he proceeded no further. It is unknown what happened to Rahgot other than that when he died he was sealed in a sarcophagus within the refectory.\nWhen he is encountered, Rahgot is accompanied by a number of leveled &lt;a href=\"Draugr%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;draugr&lt;/a&gt;.\nInteractions.\n&lt;a href=\"Siege%20on%20the%20Dragon%20Cult\"&gt;Siege on the Dragon Cult&lt;/a&gt;.\nRahgot can be encountered within the Nordic ruin of Forelhost during the quest \"Siege on the Dragon Cult.\"\nNotable items.\nUpon defeat, he drops &lt;a href=\"Rahgot%20%28Mask%29\"&gt;Rahgot&lt;/a&gt;\u2014one of the eight mysterious &lt;a href=\"dragon%20priest%20mask\"&gt;dragon priest mask&lt;/a&gt;s located throughout Skyrim.

On an otherwise normal day, the skies above the small village suddenly darkened, and burning &lt;a href=\"Dog%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;dogs&lt;/a&gt; rained down from the heavens. The carnage was terrible, according to witnesses. Charred dog carcasses littered the village, and the smell alone was enough to drive many residents into their homes. When asked about the event, local mage and weather expert &lt;a href=\"Castus%20Philidus\"&gt;Castus Philidus&lt;/a&gt; had this to say:\n\"There seems to be no precedent for this in all of Tamrielic history. While there have been stories of insects, frogs, and the occasional wayward mage crashing to the earth, I've never encountered tales of burning dogs raining from the skies. It is possible that the dogs were the part of some mage's experiments with summoning gone bad, or perhaps the dogs were swept up in a great wind and hurled into the sky. This might explain the dogs falling onto the unfortunate Border Watch community. Of course, that still doesn't explain why they were on fire.\"\nWhile the experts seem puzzled, the residents of Border Watch see only one explanation.\n\"It is the end of the world!\" said one resident, who asked not to be named in this article. \"The &lt;a href=\"K%27Sharra%20Prophecy\"&gt;K'Sharra Prophecy&lt;/a&gt;\" tells us that this will happen! The rats! The sheep! We are all doomed! Doomed!\"\nProphecy? Mages? Freak weather occurrence? We may never know. And the small village of Border Watch will definitely never be the same."}

I've agreed to help Olorime defeat Z'Maja and save the city.\"\nWalkthrough.\nIn the city of &lt;a href=\"Cloudrest%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Cloudrest&lt;/a&gt;, you will meet a woman named Olorime. She will tell you that the city is under attack by a sload named &lt;a href=\"Z%27Maja\"&gt;Z'Maja&lt;/a&gt;, and that Z'Maja has created corrupted shadows of her fellow &lt;a href=\"Welkynar\"&gt;Welkynar&lt;/a&gt; soldiers. Once the Vestige offers to help take care of the situation, Olorime will explain that Z'Maja is in the aerie just beyond the gate, but that she will likely summon the corrupted welkynars to her aid if you engage her directly, so it might be best to engage them one by one. \nHead through the gates. You can either engage with Z'Maja and the corrputed Welkynars all at once, or you can single out each of the welkynars and defeat them individually before you take on the sload. \nAll the bosses in this trial have some characteristics in common: every once in a while, Z'Maja will open a portal to the shadow realm in the middle of the battlefield. A group of players should head into these portals and destroy the crystals there. These crystals will shoot damaging spells at the players in the shadow realm, so bring a healer. Destroying the crystals will send glowing shards to the players in the regular world, which they must then send back to the shadow realm. Back in the shadow realm, the players there must pick up the orbs from the crystals and take them to the shards. The orbs deal a hefty amount of damage, to make sure to heal up well and run fast. Once this is done, the portal will close for the time being. If the same players attempt to use the portals to the shadow realm twice in a row though, they will die, so make sure to have at least two teams of players who will go into the shadow realm.\nIn addition, all of the welkynars will have a &lt;a href=\"Gryphon\"&gt;Gryphon&lt;/a&gt; that aids them in battle. Make sure that the Welkynar and the Gryphon are not too close together, as that will power them up. You will want to kill the boss and the gryphon around the same time, as not doing so will cause tentacles to spawn that will stun players and deal damage. \nIf you head northwast from where the sload waits, you will find the battlefield where you will face off against the shade of &lt;a href=\"Galenwe\"&gt;Galenwe&lt;/a&gt;. Galenwe's Gryphon likes to usesomething called the Hoarfrost; it will place a curse on a player that will slow them down and deal damage. This curse can be dropped after 6 seconds; this will make the hoarfrost fall to the ground, where it can be picked up by another player. If it is not picked up, it will shoot damage at everyone. Make sure not to enter the shadow realm with this on you, as it will probably kill you in there. \nIn the northwest, your foe will be the shade of &lt;a href=\"Siroria\"&gt;Siroria&lt;/a&gt;. During this fight, if you see an area of effect appear around a player, get into that area. The damage done by this attack will be divided among the players in the area; if one player is in there alone, they will die. Siroria also likes to jump around and create a fire effect wherever she lands. \nThe third and final welkynar can be found in the southwest. This is the shade of &lt;a href=\"Relequen\"&gt;Relequen&lt;/a&gt;. This boss likes to put a curse on your active weapon that damages you and everyone around you. If you see lightning form above you, immediately swap your weapon and do not swap back for 10 seconds. He also likes to send out a stun beam that has high kill power, so make sure that this is interrupted.\nOnce all three welkynars have been defeated, it is time to face off against Z'Maja herself. Head to the center of the area and confront her. This fight also has parts of the crew enter the shadow realm to close the portals, but there are some differences this time. In the shadow realm, players will see not three, but six crystals, three of which are decoys. Simply destroy the crystals until you find the right ones. The bigger problem though is the shadow of Z'Maja present in this realm. This shadow has the same attacks as the regular Z'Maja, so make sure to bring a tank into the realm this time. If the portal is not closed fast enough during this fight, the shadow Z'Maja will head through the portal, and if it does, everyone will die, causing a wipe. \nThe boss itself has some pretty powerful attacks, so keep its attention on the tank and away from the group. The boss will also spawn orbs that will damage the players if they touch them; these can be destroyed. She also likes to throw laserbeams out; these target two players, so make sure to get away from the group when you are targeted. Occasionally, the boss will summon a cone from the portal that will drag whoever it hits into the shado realm or into the normal world if they were already in the shadow realm. This is deadly if the player went through the previous portal. In addition to all this, when a player dies, a shadowy clone of them will spawn that must be killed before the player can be revived. Once the main Z'Maja is down, the shadow will come into the real world; it has the same attacks as the regular Z'Maja, so this fight should play out much the same. \nOnce Z'Maja and her shadow are dead, talk to Olorime to finish the quest."}

They appear almost anywhere outdoors (excluding wet environments, such as swamps). They can also be found in &lt;a href=\"Caves%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;caves&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Mines%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;mines&lt;/a&gt;, or &lt;a href=\"Forts%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;forts&lt;/a&gt;, be it alone, as a pack, with different animals. They can also be found accompanying a &lt;a href=\"Vampire%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;vampire&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Bandits%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;bandit&lt;/a&gt;, or a &lt;a href=\"Werewolf%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;werewolf&lt;/a&gt;, who keep them as guards or companions. Wolves also inhabit &lt;a href=\"Solstheim%20%28Dragonborn%29\"&gt;Solstheim&lt;/a&gt; in great numbers and are revered by the indigenous &lt;a href=\"Skaal\"&gt;Skaal&lt;/a&gt;.\nBehavior.\nAlthough the wolves of &lt;a href=\"Skyrim\"&gt;Skyrim&lt;/a&gt; can be vicious, they are not always aggressive. They have territorial habits - in most cases, they will not attack the &lt;a href=\"Last%20Dragonborn\"&gt;Dragonborn&lt;/a&gt; unless he or she draws near. Wolves howling or assuming an aggressive stance are giving a warning that\u00a0the Dragonborn\u00a0is getting too close to them. Continuing to approach them will instigate an attack.\nBy contrast, &lt;a href=\"Ice%20Wolf%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Ice Wolves&lt;/a&gt; are more powerful, aggressive and deadly, possessing more &lt;a href=\"Health%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;health&lt;/a&gt; and capable of dealing more damage than the standard wolf. They can be found in higher elevations in the mountains or in the northeastern, frozen areas of Skyrim. Ice wolves attack prey on sight. The natural camouflage of their coats make them difficult to see in the snow.\nSolitary wolves can be encountered, or packs of two or three may be found. If in a pack, wolves will use flanking and diversionary tactics to bring down prey. Very rarely will a wolf move straight towards a target, opting instead to circle the target to avoid &lt;a href=\"Arrows%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;arrows&lt;/a&gt; and to force the target to fend off the pack from all directions. Though weak, these creatures may be dangerous for an unsuspecting low-level Dragonborn. Wolves will flee from combat when they reach a certain amount of health, in order to regenerate their health. After doing so they will rejoin the fight.\nIf the Dragonborn transforms into a &lt;a href=\"Werewolf%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Werewolf&lt;/a&gt;, wolves will remain non-hostile, and will occasionally follow them.\nVariants.\nThere are several subspecies of wolf, including &lt;a href=\"ice%20wolf\"&gt;ice wolf&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"pit%20wolf\"&gt;pit wolf&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Alpha%20Wolf%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;alpha wolf&lt;/a&gt;."}

This message is found to be from Greyman, who asks that the Agent meet his \"messenger\" in a &lt;a href=\"Taverns%20%28Daggerfall%29\"&gt;tavern&lt;/a&gt;, in a town elsewhere in the &lt;a href=\"Iliac%20Bay\"&gt;Bay&lt;/a&gt;.\nA Novel Messenger.\nThere is no time limit for visiting the \"messenger\" in the tavern, although when the Agent does so they will be in for a surprise. Indeed, in Greyman's preferred tavern will be an &lt;a href=\"Iron%20Atronach%20%28Daggerfall%29\"&gt;iron atronach&lt;/a&gt;, with the words \"HIT ME\" apparently attached to its back. The Agent must duly strike at the atronach once for it to respond:\nWith that, the atronach disappears and the Agent is off to the famed &lt;a href=\"Direnni%20Tower%20%28Daggerfall%29\"&gt;Direnni Tower&lt;/a&gt;.\nMeeting the Mage.\nGreyman will have already entered the Tower upon the Agent's arrival, meaning they will have to find him at some point during the quest. To do so, they must enter the main Tower section, head down the first set of steps before climbing up the other set. On the second floor of the second set of steps will be a doorway to the room in which Greyman is staying, with the mage himself stating:\nFrom this point Greyman will accompany the Agent in the hunt for the chest, using spells on the first sight of an enemy. Greyman will also make a variety of comments after battling the random assortment of &lt;a href=\"Creatures%20%28Daggerfall%29\"&gt;undead creatures&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe Search for Wonders.\nThe search for the chest centres on finding the \"pyramid\" room within the Tower, with the Agent needing to get to the platform-like area overlooking the pyramid itself. To do this the Agent must go down one flight of steps from Greyman's hiding spot, turn the wheel on the wall, before heading back to the corridor with the entrance. From there the Agent must enter the doorway down the corridor, turn 180\u00b0 and follow the second corridor into the second room before interacting with the brickwall within.\nThe wall will teleport the Agent to an underwater area, although to escape simply head through the only doorway and climb the spiral staircase to exits into a solitary room. The Agent must interact with the second brick-style wall to teleport to the next section, a room with a closed trapdoor and two doors. The southern door is the correct one to enter the pyramid chamber, although the Agent needs to get onto the area above. Fortunately a chain by the alter of the pyramid casts a levitation spell, allowing a quick climb to the chest.\nA Guardian's Duty.\nUpon climbing onto the platform above the pyramid, the Agent will likely have to slay an undead before approaching the chest. The chest itself lies on its own in the middle of the platform, with conformation of it being the target chest coming when the Agent interacts with it:\nAt this point a &lt;a href=\"Fire%20Daedra%20%28Daggerfall%29\"&gt;Fire Daedra&lt;/a&gt; will appear, with the Agent needing to defeat it, or wait until Greyman casts a &lt;a href=\"Banish%20Daedra%20%28Daggerfall%29\"&gt;banishing&lt;/a&gt; spell. Either way, once the Daedra has been dispersed, the Agent must escape the Tower, with Greyman still accompanying them. Once the Agent is out, Greyman will hand them their reward.\nRewards.\nThe Agent will receive a random &lt;a href=\"Enchantments%20%28Daggerfall%29\"&gt;magical&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Items%20%28Daggerfall%29\"&gt;item&lt;/a&gt; from Greyman for their efforts. However, regardless of whether the Agent completes the quest successfully, or fails, they will receive the same penalties to their reputation:"}

Woodhearth is a melting pot of culture ranging from the &lt;a href=\"High%20Elves\"&gt;High Elves&lt;/a&gt; of the &lt;a href=\"Summerset%20Isles\"&gt;Summerset Isles&lt;/a&gt; to the &lt;a href=\"Imperials\"&gt;Imperials&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"Cyrodiil\"&gt;Cyrodiil&lt;/a&gt;. Woodhearth is one of the busiest ports located across the &lt;a href=\"Abecean%20Sea\"&gt;Abecean Sea&lt;/a&gt;.\nDescription.\nGeography.\nWoodhearth is one of the many port towns located along the &lt;a href=\"Blue%20Divide\"&gt;Blue Divide&lt;/a&gt;, the sea in between the Valenwood mainland and the Isle of &lt;a href=\"Auridon\"&gt;Auridon&lt;/a&gt; in the west. Woodhearth has had influence from the High Elves in the west since the city is the closest one to the provinces. Woodhearth is built on an area along the &lt;a href=\"Drowned%20Coast\"&gt;Drowned Coast&lt;/a&gt; where the marsh meets the sea, in a fertile grassland on the coast. The settlement built before Woodhearth has had several &lt;a href=\"Graht-oak\"&gt;Graht-oak&lt;/a&gt; trees located in the southern district, in the marshes. As time went on, the &lt;a href=\"Imperials\"&gt;Imperials&lt;/a&gt; of Cyrodiil began to build fortifications across the coast, creating a perimeter that would become the port town of Woodhearth. As time went on, the Imperials abandoned the settlement and the &lt;a href=\"Altmer\"&gt;Altmer&lt;/a&gt; arrived into town. They built their own structures in the northern end as well as rejuvenated the harbor along the western shore. East of the city are several marshlands such as &lt;a href=\"Rootwater%20Grove\"&gt;Rootwater Grove&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Shademist%20Moors\"&gt;Shademist Moors&lt;/a&gt;. There are not many settlements located near Woodhearth, other than &lt;a href=\"Longhaven\"&gt;Longhaven&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Diss\"&gt;Diss&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Dread%20Vullain\"&gt;Dread Vullain&lt;/a&gt;.\nHistory.\n&lt;a href=\"First%20Era\"&gt;First Era&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe Maormer Conquest of Valenwood.\nWoodhearth, along with the other &lt;a href=\"Ayleid\"&gt;Ayleid&lt;/a&gt; cities in Valenwood, was flourishing in the trade with the foundation of the &lt;a href=\"White-Gold%20Tower\"&gt;White-Gold Tower&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Cyrodiil\"&gt;Cyrodiil&lt;/a&gt;. Greater settlements such as &lt;a href=\"Elden%20Root\"&gt;Elden Root&lt;/a&gt; were being established in the eastern forest of &lt;a href=\"Grahtwood\"&gt;Grahtwood&lt;/a&gt;. Things took a turn for the worst when the &lt;a href=\"Maormer\"&gt;Maormer&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"Pyandonea\"&gt;Pyandonea&lt;/a&gt; invaded the Ayleid colonies along the coast, this included the towns of Woodhearth and &lt;a href=\"Haven\"&gt;Haven&lt;/a&gt;. They eventually moved into Elden Root and besieged the city, destroying their great libraries and universities, high atop of the &lt;a href=\"Elden%20Tree\"&gt;Elden Tree&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe Alesssian Reforms &amp; Treethane's Independence.\nDuring the First Era, the provinces of Valenwood and Cyrodiil waged war against each other, even after the &lt;a href=\"Alessian%20Reforms\"&gt;Alessian Reforms&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"Marukh\"&gt;Marukh&lt;/a&gt;. These conflicts arose when &lt;a href=\"High%20King%20Borgas\"&gt;High King Borgas&lt;/a&gt; was killed during the &lt;a href=\"Wild%20Hunt\"&gt;Wild Hunt&lt;/a&gt;. The war ended after a series of losing battles and the &lt;a href=\"Thrassian%20Plague\"&gt;Thrassian Plague&lt;/a&gt;, the province of Valenwood fell to the Empire. Several advancements were made in Valenwood, one of which resulted in the founding of &lt;a href=\"Southpoint\"&gt;Southpoint&lt;/a&gt;. The power the &lt;a href=\"Camoran%20Dynasty\"&gt;Camoran Dynasty&lt;/a&gt; had over Valenwood was diminishing, ensuring Valenwood would not join with the High Elves of Camoran, the Empire granted independence to the treethanes in different settlements across Valenwood. These cities included Woodhearth, &lt;a href=\"Falinesti\"&gt;Falinesti&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Silvenar%20%28City%29\"&gt;Silvenar&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Haven\"&gt;Haven&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Archen\"&gt;Archen&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Elden%20Root\"&gt;Elden Root&lt;/a&gt; went from simple trading posts to large civilizations with their own power across the realms.\nOrigin of Woodhearth; the Green Pact Alliance.\nThe Imperials established the town of Woodhearth as a trading post along the Blue Divide and to develop business with the &lt;a href=\"Wood%20Elves\"&gt;Wood Elves&lt;/a&gt; of Valenwood. The reception from the Elves was curiosity, friendship, and hospitality, it was a treat to the tree people since it served as a port town and a fortress, protecting people from the threats of the forest such as the &lt;a href=\"Hollow\"&gt;Hollow&lt;/a&gt; or the &lt;a href=\"Lurcher%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Lurcher&lt;/a&gt;. The town was attacked by several Bosmer tribes that were against the idea of Woodhearth; they retaliated by using &lt;a href=\"Destruction\"&gt;Destruction&lt;/a&gt; Magic to destroy the walls of the town, they were driven back by the local &lt;a href=\"Imperial%20Legion\"&gt;Imperial Legion&lt;/a&gt;, with their superior weaponry.\nPeace was eventually brought into Woodhearth between the &lt;a href=\"Green%20Pact\"&gt;Green Pact&lt;/a&gt; Bosmer and the Imperials in town. The Wood Elves established treehomes along the southern district that connect through each other on the treetops. It gave Woodhearth a special connection to the green. As time went on, Woodhearth naturally moved to the Wood Elves, when the Bosmer became an effective power in the &lt;a href=\"Second%20Empire\"&gt;Second Empire&lt;/a&gt;. A &lt;a href=\"Treethane\"&gt;Treethane&lt;/a&gt; was established in Woodhearth, to ensure the power of the Bosmer further. The Treethanes of Woodhearth have become notorious throughout Valenwood for their sheer determination and their fair judgment for the denizens of Woodhearth. The Treethanes would continue to rule the city of Woodhearth, even in the Second Era and beyond.\n&lt;a href=\"Second%20Era\"&gt;Second Era&lt;/a&gt;.\nTrouble in Woodhearth; Pelidil's Gambit.\nDuring the &lt;a href=\"Interregnum\"&gt;Interregnum&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"2E%20582\"&gt;2E 582&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Vicereeve%20Pelidil\"&gt;Vicereeve Pelidil&lt;/a&gt; stole the &lt;a href=\"Staff%20of%20Magnus\"&gt;Staff of Magnus&lt;/a&gt; from the city of &lt;a href=\"Marbruk\"&gt;Marbruk&lt;/a&gt; and used it to create a shade of &lt;a href=\"Prince%20Naemon\"&gt;Prince Naemon&lt;/a&gt;, the Prince of &lt;a href=\"Alinor\"&gt;Alinor&lt;/a&gt;. Naemon had perished after an unfortunate encounter in &lt;a href=\"Elden%20Root\"&gt;Elden Root&lt;/a&gt; with the Orrery. Pelidil, with the help of the &lt;a href=\"Veiled%20Heritance\"&gt;Veiled Heritance&lt;/a&gt; plans to destroy the Aldmeri Dominion and to seek revenge for Naemon, by slaying &lt;a href=\"Queen%20Ayrenn\"&gt;Queen Ayrenn&lt;/a&gt; of the Dominion. After stealing the staff, Pelidil traveled to the city of Woodhearth and remained in hiding, with a planned assassination attempt on Ayrenn. &lt;a href=\"Treethane%20Fariel\"&gt;Treethane Fariel&lt;/a&gt; believes that there is a spy amidst the &lt;a href=\"Thalmor\"&gt;Thalmor&lt;/a&gt;, she felt that it was best to root them out from the shadows. Fariel and &lt;a href=\"Razum-dar\"&gt;Razum-dar&lt;/a&gt; of the &lt;a href=\"Eyes%20of%20the%20Queen\"&gt;Eyes of the Queen&lt;/a&gt; plan to root out the traitor by having Raz disguised as Queen Ayrenn and to tour the &lt;a href=\"Imperial%20Underground\"&gt;Imperial Underground&lt;/a&gt;, a place avoided by many. Raz asked one of his close friends, a warrior named the &lt;a href=\"Vestige\"&gt;Vestige&lt;/a&gt;, to travel with them as Ayrenn and to uncover the assassin at the sewers. While in the Underground, the two were attacked by &lt;a href=\"Asteril\"&gt;Asteril&lt;/a&gt;, a young member of the Thalmor and the assassin of the Veil. She disappeared into the sewers with the Vestige following suite. They discovered orders from Pelidil and sent it to Fariel and the Thalmor.\nBetrayal in the Thalmor; Pelidil's Demise.\nMembers of the Thalmor, including the leader of the Woodhearth Thalmor, &lt;a href=\"Oromin\"&gt;Oromin&lt;/a&gt; believed that Asteril would never betray the Dominion. The Vestige and Oromin traveled to the Thalmor Resting Quarters to interrogate Asteril about the rest incident. They arrived in late, and Asteril was found murdered in her room. Razum-dar found a hidden path to the underground near Asteril, the Vestige enters the underground to find a dying heritance member named &lt;a href=\"Laryaril\"&gt;Laryaril&lt;/a&gt; on the floor, she explains that Pelidil is gathering an army and is currently besieging the fortress of &lt;a href=\"Seaside%20Sanctuary\"&gt;Seaside Sanctuary&lt;/a&gt; in the north. It will be the staging grounds of Siege on Woodhearth. With this news, Treethane Fariel and the Thalmor of Woodhearth begin to plan a counterattack on Pelidil's Forces to reclaim the Seaside Sanctuary.\n&lt;a href=\"Third%20Era\"&gt;Third Era&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe War of the Blue Divide; the Woodhearth Blockade.\nDuring the &lt;a href=\"Imperial%20Simulacrum\"&gt;Imperial Simulacrum&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"3E%20397\"&gt;3E 397&lt;/a&gt;, the province of Valenwood and the western subcontinent of the Summerset Isles waged war against each other across the Blue Divide in a conflict called the &lt;a href=\"War%20of%20the%20Blue%20Divide\"&gt;War of the Blue Divide&lt;/a&gt;. The Altmeri Navy surrounded the city along the western coast and tried to starve the people through a blockade. This endeavor proved to be tiresome since the Wood Elves are known to be willing cannibals. The Wood Elves preserve the forest and see any meat as valuable food. After battles, the feast on the enemies flesh since it would have been a waste. Valenwood was ravaged by war during the Simulacrum; they have the War of the Blue Divide in the west and the &lt;a href=\"Five%20Year%20War\"&gt;Five Year War&lt;/a&gt; in the east with the &lt;a href=\"Khajiit\"&gt;Khajiit&lt;/a&gt;.\nWoodhearth during the Imperial Simulacrum.\nThe Imperial Simulacrum started from &lt;a href=\"3E%20389\"&gt;3E 389&lt;/a&gt; to &lt;a href=\"3E%20399\"&gt;3E 399&lt;/a&gt;, when &lt;a href=\"Emperor\"&gt;Emperor&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Uriel%20Septim%20VII\"&gt;Uriel Septim VII&lt;/a&gt; was imprisoned along with &lt;a href=\"Talin%20Warhaft\"&gt;Talin Warhaft&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;a href=\"Deadlands\"&gt;Deadlands&lt;/a&gt; by &lt;a href=\"Jagar%20Tharn\"&gt;Jagar Tharn&lt;/a&gt;. Tharn planned for months to capture the throne, and he was able to achieve so in the span of ten years. Tharn had a powerful weapon called the &lt;a href=\"Staff%20of%20Chaos\"&gt;Staff of Chaos&lt;/a&gt;, and he split it into nine pieces and scattered them across Tamriel, the staff was the only thing keeping Uriel Septim and Warhaft in &lt;a href=\"Oblivion\"&gt;Oblivion&lt;/a&gt;. A warrior escaped his clutches and traveled all corners of Tamriel to retrieve the missing pieces. The hero was known as the &lt;a href=\"Eternal%20Champion\"&gt;Eternal Champion&lt;/a&gt;, and he assembled the staff and defeated Jagar Tharn at the &lt;a href=\"Imperial%20Palace\"&gt;Imperial Palace&lt;/a&gt;. The Eternal Champion had at one point visited the city of Woodhearth in their quest to recover the pieces. The city of Woodhearth was under the rule of &lt;a href=\"Queen%20Laredia\"&gt;Queen Laredia&lt;/a&gt;."}

Wood is required and can be gathered throughout &lt;a href=\"Tamriel\"&gt;Tamriel&lt;/a&gt; using an axe on logs found on the ground. Once the wood has been extracted into sanded wood, the player may create &lt;a href=\"Shields%20%28Online%29\"&gt;shields&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Bows%20%28Online%29\"&gt;bows&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Staves%20%28Online%29\"&gt;staves&lt;/a&gt;.\nTo use the Woodworking skill, players must use a &lt;a href=\"Woodworking%20Station\"&gt;Woodworking Station&lt;/a&gt;.\nEach craftable item has a minimum and maximum number of wood. For example, a Bow may require a minimum of 3 Sanded Maple, and take a maximum of 9. With each piece of Sanded Maple added to the 3, the damage and level requirement increases.\nIt is also necessary for players to use &lt;a href=\"Style%20Materials\"&gt;Style Materials&lt;/a&gt; according to the style they wish to craft. By default they are only able to craft their own &lt;a href=\"Races%20%28Online%29\"&gt;race's&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"styles\"&gt;styles&lt;/a&gt;. The necessary stones may be purchased from any crafting vendor.\nType.\nThere are several types of equipment that players may create:\nMaterial.\nThere is a wide variety of materials that players may use in Woodworking. The higher level the material, the better the results. For example, an Oak Bow will yield better results than a Maple Bow.\nList of materials:\nStyle.\nThe style of the weapon or shield is determined using &lt;a href=\"Style%20Materials\"&gt;Style Materials&lt;/a&gt;.\nTrait.\n&lt;a href=\"Traits\"&gt;Traits&lt;/a&gt; may be added to weapons and shields using particular gems.\nSkills.\nEach crafting skill yields passive skills related to the skill that can be levelled with the skill.

You're less than a pile of Goblin droppings unless you have a trade, and I ain't letting my kin stink up the cabin.\nToday you learn how to work with wood. Now, stop your belly-groanin' and listen! &lt;a href=\"Woodworking\"&gt;Woodworkin&lt;/a&gt;' is an honest trade, and you're going to do right by old Hoary. I'll use tiny words so even Tebbons can follow.\nFirst off, take this axe to the woods. Look for mossy logs near old stumps and rocks, and then chop me ten pieces of &lt;a href=\"rough%20maple\"&gt;rough maple&lt;/a&gt;.\u00a0What? Why is it called\u2014 Because it's rough, ye daft child! You'll need that much if you're to make something of anything.\nSecond, bring those ten rough maple pieces to a &lt;a href=\"Woodworking%20Station\"&gt;woodworkin' station&lt;/a&gt; station. You're gonna turn those rough maple pieces into sanded maple. We in the trade call it \"refinement.\" No, not sanding, refinement! Yes, you get sanded wood. No, that's not confusing at all!\nThird\u2014 Would ye listen up? This is important! Ye can't just start carvin' away at sanded maple without a style in mind. Hmm? A style! Every race in Tamriel has their own style, and a material they prefer to work.\nThem Dark Elves craft materials in the Dark Elf style, d'ye see? Now, ye buy the style material in town. From a woodworker, ye addlepated\u2014 No, it doesn't matter which one!\nLastly, your last task is takin' your style material and three sanded maple pieces to a woodworkin' station. Craft yerself a maple bow. Don't worry about the bowstring. I said, pay it no mind! Curvin' that bow like the leg of a bendy Wood Elf dancer is what you should try to\u2014 Hmm? None of your concern!\nWhat do you mean, \"Is that all?\" By the &lt;a href=\"Eight%20Divines\"&gt;Eight Divines&lt;/a&gt;, of course that ain't all there is to woodworkin'! Ye can make better quality carpentry if more wood goes into an item's makin'. Even then, ye can improve it further.\nI was gettin' to it! That maple bow isn't the best you can make it until you improve it with &lt;a href=\"Resin%20%28Online%29\"&gt;resins&lt;/a&gt;. You'll find 'em around. You know, \"around!\" But try to improve that bow without enough resin and you'll ruin the bow and waste the resin.\nYes, there'll always be maple in the woods. What do you mean? When are you going to be in a desert? Oh, for \u2026 All right. You're in a desert, and ye can't find maple because you can't find the woods. But say ye have your maple bow. Bring it to a woodworkin' station and deconstruct some of what ye need from the bow itself. 'Course, ye lose the bow. We call this part \"deconstruction\"\u2014like your sister's bad poetry, if ye could take a chisel to it.\nHow'd I get so good at woodworkin'? Research. No, not like reading. If I got my hands on a decent piece of carpentry, I'd take it apart and study the traits that made it special. Took me time, and I'd lose the carpentry when I pulled it apart, but once I'd worked out how the original woodworker done it, I could make it myself.\nNow close your mouth, &lt;a href=\"Tebbons\"&gt;Tebbons&lt;/a&gt;, 'afore you swallow a fleshfly."}

The ancient carvings etched into the stone are believed to be words in the &lt;a href=\"Dragon%20Language\"&gt;Dragon Language&lt;/a&gt;, for the characters of that language very much resemble claw marks or scratches.\nIt is believed that these walls were constructed by the ancient &lt;a href=\"Nords\"&gt;Nords&lt;/a&gt; who lived in the time of the &lt;a href=\"Dragons%20%28Lore%29\"&gt;Dragons&lt;/a&gt;. Either out of fear or respect, they somehow learned the language of the ancient beasts so they could use it for their own ends.\nPurpose.\nThe translations themselves all appear to follow a similar theme, repeating the words \"Here lies...\"\" This suggests that the walls marked ancient Nord burial grounds or marked the grave of an important figure.\nDuring the events of , the true power of the Word Walls is revealed. Not only did they mark burial grounds, but existed to teach a &lt;a href=\"Word%20of%20Power\"&gt;Word of Power&lt;/a&gt; to those with the ability to learn.\nInteractions.\nWhen the &lt;a href=\"Last%20Dragonborn\"&gt;Dragonborn&lt;/a&gt; locates a Word Wall, they have the ability to read the ancient carvings. Reading a wall will highlight a particular word in the paragraph - a Word of Power. Once a Word of Power has been learned from a wall, a &lt;a href=\"Dragon%20Soul\"&gt;Dragon Soul&lt;/a&gt; is required to unlock it and turn it into a &lt;a href=\"Dragon%20Shout\"&gt;Dragon Shout&lt;/a&gt;.\nMost Word Walls, with the exception of the word walls in &lt;a href=\"Shearpoint\"&gt;Shearpoint&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Vahlok%27s%20Tomb\"&gt;Vahlok's Tomb&lt;/a&gt; , only reveal one Word of Power. In order to learn a complete shout, the Dragonborn is required to learn all three words of a shout.\nWhen in close proximity to a Word Wall, Nordic music and chanting can be heard and will increase in volume the closer the Dragonborn gets to it.\nWord Walls, whether inside &lt;a href=\"Nordic%20Tombs\"&gt;Nordic tombs&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Dragon%20Lairs\"&gt;Dragon Lairs&lt;/a&gt; or the like, should not be approached lightly, as they are nearly always guarded, with &lt;a href=\"Dragons%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Dragons&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Draugr%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Draugr&lt;/a&gt; and even &lt;a href=\"Dragon%20Priests%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Dragon Priests&lt;/a&gt;. Some word walls, such as Shearpoint, &lt;a href=\"Arcwind%20Point%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Arcwind Point&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Saering%27s%20Watch\"&gt;Saering's Watch&lt;/a&gt;, are particularly formidable, guarded by a combination of a Dragon and Draugr, with Shearpoint, for example, guarded by a Dragon and the Dragon Priest &lt;a href=\"Krosis\"&gt;Krosis&lt;/a&gt;. It should be noted that not all word walls are guarded by Dragons or the undead, for example &lt;a href=\"Sunderstone%20Gorge\"&gt;Sunderstone Gorge&lt;/a&gt; is inhabited by levelled mages, whilst &lt;a href=\"Dead%20Crone%20Rock\"&gt;Dead Crone Rock&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Lost%20Valley%20Redoubt%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Lost Valley Redoubt&lt;/a&gt; are populated by &lt;a href=\"Forsworn\"&gt;Forsworn&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Hagraven%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Hagravens&lt;/a&gt;, all of which are formidable enemies. If word walls are visited prior to the completion of &lt;a href=\"Dragon%20Rising\"&gt;Dragon Rising&lt;/a&gt;, then a dragon will not be present, but other enemies will be.\nDragon script.\nThe ancient carvings on Word Walls can vary, and are dependent upon what Words of Power the Dragonborn already knows at the time of the encounter with the wall.\nFor example, if the Dragonborn were to learn the first Word of Power for &lt;a href=\"Animal%20Allegiance\"&gt;Animal Allegiance&lt;/a&gt; from &lt;a href=\"Ancient%27s%20Ascent\"&gt;Ancient's Ascent&lt;/a&gt;, then the wall would display the first carving in the table below. However, if the Dragonborn was to learn the first word from &lt;a href=\"Angarvunde\"&gt;Angarvunde&lt;/a&gt;, then the first carving would be displayed in \"that\" location instead.\nIf the Dragonborn was to later visit Ancient's Ascent to learn the second word, the carving would be the second carving in the table as the first word has already been learned.\nTranslations.\nThe following are translations and locations of all known Word Walls found throughout Skyrim. It should be noted that some of the word walls require the Dragonborn to be on a quest to reach them."}

During the &lt;a href=\"black%20year\"&gt;black year&lt;/a&gt;- of &lt;a href=\"3E%20396\"&gt;396&lt;/a&gt;, when the &lt;a href=\"Parikh%20tribe\"&gt;Parikh tribe&lt;/a&gt; began their rampage through southeastern Valenwood with the aid of powers from the &lt;a href=\"Summurset%20Isle\"&gt;Summurset Isle&lt;/a&gt;, Lady Benoch fought the futile battle to keep her tribe's land.\n\"I killed someone for the first time when I was sixteen,\" she says now. \"I don't remember it very well -- he or she was just a blur on the horizon where I aimed my bow. It meant no more to me than shooting animals. I probably killed a hundred people like that during that summer and fall. I didn't really feel like a killer until that wintertide, when I learned what it was like to look into a man's eyes as you spilled his blood.\n\"It was a scout from the Parikh tribe who surprised me while I was on camp watch. We surprised each other, I suppose. I had my bow at my side, and I just panicked, trying to string an arrow when he was half a yard away from me. It was the only thing I knew to do. Of course, he struck first with his blade, and I just fell back in shock.\n\"You always remember the mistakes of your first victim. His mistake was assuming because he had drawn blood and I had fallen, that I was dead. I rushed at him the moment he turned from me towards the sleeping camp of my tribesmen. He was caught off guard, and I wrested his blade away from him.\n\"I don't know how many times I stabbed at him. By the time I stopped, when the next watch came to relieve me, my arms were black and blue with strain, there was not a solid piece of him left. I had literally cut him into pieces. You see, I had no concept of how to fight or how much it took to kill a man.\"\nLady Benoch, aware of this deficiency in her education, began teaching herself swordsmanship at once.\n\"You can't learn how to use a sword in Valenwood,\" she says. \"Which isn't to say Bosmer can't use blades, but we're largely self-taught. As much as it hurt when my tribe found itself homeless, pushed to the north, it did have one good aspect: it afforded me the opportunity to meet &lt;a href=\"Redguards\"&gt;Redguards&lt;/a&gt;.\"\nStudying all manners of weapon wielding under the tutelage of &lt;a href=\"Warday%20A%27kor\"&gt;Warday A'kor&lt;/a&gt;, Lady Benoch excelled. She became a freelance adventurer, traveling through the wilds of southern &lt;a href=\"Hammerfell\"&gt;Hammerfell&lt;/a&gt; and northern &lt;a href=\"Valenwood\"&gt;Valenwood&lt;/a&gt;, protecting caravans and visiting dignitaries from the various dangers indigenous to the population.\nUnfortunately, before we were able to pursue her story of her early years any further, Lady Benoch was called away on urgent summons from the Emperor. Such is often the case with the &lt;a href=\"Guard\"&gt;Imperial Guard&lt;/a&gt;, and in these troubled times, perhaps, more so than in the past. When I tried to contact her for another talk, her servants informed me than their mistress was in &lt;a href=\"Skyrim\"&gt;Skyrim&lt;/a&gt;. Another month passed, and when I visited her suite, I was told she was in &lt;a href=\"High%20Rock\"&gt;High Rock&lt;/a&gt;.\nTo her credit, Lady Benoch actually sought me out for our second interview on &lt;a href=\"Sun%27s%20Dusk\"&gt;Sun's Dusk&lt;/a&gt; of that year. I was in a tavern in the City called the &lt;a href=\"Blood%20and%20Rooster\"&gt;Blood and Rooster&lt;/a&gt;, when I felt her hand on my shoulder. She sat down at the rude table and continued her tale as if it had never been interrupted.\nShe returned to the theme of her days as an adventurer, and told me about the first time she ever felt confident with a sword.\n\"I owned at that time an enchanted &lt;a href=\"Daedric%20Dai-katana\"&gt;daikatana&lt;/a&gt;, quite a good one, of daedric metal. It wasn't an original &lt;a href=\"Akaviri\"&gt;Akaviri&lt;/a&gt;, not even of design. I didn't have that kind of money, but it served my primary purpose of delivering as much damage with as little effort on my part as possible. A'kor had taught me how to fence, but when faced with a life or death situation, I always fell back on the old overhand wallop.\n\"A pack of &lt;a href=\"Orsimer\"&gt;Orcs&lt;/a&gt; had stolen some gold from a local chieftain in &lt;a href=\"Meditea\"&gt;Meditea&lt;/a&gt;, and I went looking for them in one of the ubiquitous dungeons that dot the countryside in that region. There were the usual rats and giant spiders, and I was enough of a veteran by then to dispatch them with relative ease. The problem came when I found myself in a pitch black room, and all around me, I heard the grunts of orcs nearing in.\n\"I waved my sword around me, connecting with nothing, hearing their footsteps coming ever nearer. Somehow, I managed to hold back my fear and to remember the simple exercises Master A'kor had taught me. I listened, stepped sideways, swung, twisted, stepped forward, swung a circle, turned around, side-stepped, swung.\n\"My instinct was right. The orcs had gathered in a circle around me, and when I found a light, I saw that they were all dead.\n\"That's when I focused on my study of swordplay. I'm stupid enough to require a near death experience to see the practical purposes, you see.\"\nLady Benoch spent the remainder of the interview, responding in her typically blunt way to the veracity of various myths that surrounded her and her career. It was true that she became the master of the &lt;a href=\"Valenwood%20Fighters%20Guild\"&gt;Valenwood Fighters Guild&lt;/a&gt; after winning a duel with the former master, who was a stooge of the &lt;a href=\"Imperial%20Battlemage\"&gt;Imperial Battlemage&lt;/a&gt;, the traitor &lt;a href=\"Jagar%20Tharn\"&gt;Jagar Tharn&lt;/a&gt;. It was not true that she was the one responsible for the Valenwood Guild's disintegration two years later (\"Actually, the membership in the Valenwood chapter was healthy, but in &lt;a href=\"Tamriel\"&gt;Tamriel&lt;/a&gt; overall the mood was not conducive for the continued existence of a nonpartisan organization of freelance warriors.\") It was true that she first came to the Emperor's attention when she defended &lt;a href=\"Queen%20Akorithi\"&gt;Queen Akorithi&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"Sentinel\"&gt;Sentinel&lt;/a&gt; from a &lt;a href=\"Breton\"&gt;Breton&lt;/a&gt; assassin. It was not true that the assassin was hired by someone in the high court of &lt;a href=\"Daggerfall\"&gt;Daggerfall&lt;/a&gt; (\"At least,\" she says wryly, \"That has never been proven.\"). It was also true that she married her former servant &lt;a href=\"Urken\"&gt;Urken&lt;/a&gt; after he had been in her service for eleven years (\"No one knows how to keep my weaponry honed like he does,\" she says. \"It's a practical business. I either had to give him a raise or marry him.\").\nThe only story I asked her that she would neither admit nor refute was the one about &lt;a href=\"Calaxes%20Septim\"&gt;Calaxes&lt;/a&gt;, the Emperor's bastard. When I brought up the name, she shrugged, professing no knowledge of the affair. I pressed on with the details of the story. Calaxes, though not in line for succession, had been given the Archbishopric of The One: a powerful position in the &lt;a href=\"Imperial%20City\"&gt;Imperial City&lt;/a&gt;, and indeed over all Tamriel where that religion is honored. Whispering began immediately that Calaxes believed that the Gods were angered with the secular governments of Tamriel and the Emperor specifically. It was even said that Calaxes advocated full-scale rebellion to establish a theocracy over the Empire.\nIt is certainly true, I pressed on, that the Emperor's relationship with Calaxes had become very stormy, and that legislation had been passed to limit the Church's authority. That is, up until the moment when Calaxes disappeared, suddenly, without notice to his closest of friends. Many said that Lady Benoch and the Imperial Guard assassinated the Archbishop Calaxes in the sacristy of his church -- the date usually given was the 29th of Sun's Dusk 3E 498\n\"Of course,\" responds Lady Benoch with one of her mysterious grins. \"I don't need to tell you that the Imperial Guard's position is as protectors of the throne, not assassins.\"\n\"But surely, no one is more trusted that the Guard for such a sensitive operation,\" I say, carefully.\n&lt;a href=\"Lady%20Benoch\"&gt;Lady Benoch&lt;/a&gt; acknowledges that, but merely says that such details of her duties must remain secret as a matter of Imperial security. Unfortunately, her ladyship had to leave early the next morning, as the Emperor had business down south -- of course, I couldn't be told more specifics. She promised to send me word when she returned so we could continue our interview.\nAs it turned out, I had business of my own in the &lt;a href=\"Summurset%20Isle\"&gt;Summurset Isle&lt;/a&gt;, compiling a book on the &lt;a href=\"Psijic%20Order\"&gt;Psijic Order&lt;/a&gt;. It was therefore with surprise that I met her ladyship three months later in &lt;a href=\"Firsthold\"&gt;Firsthold&lt;/a&gt;. We managed to get away from our respective duties to complete our third and final interview, on a walk along the &lt;a href=\"Diceto\"&gt;Diceto&lt;/a&gt;, the great river that passes through the royal parks of the city.\nSteering away from questions of her recent duties and assignments, which I guessed rightly she was loath to answer, I returned to the subject of swordfighting.\n\"&lt;a href=\"Frandar%20Hunding\"&gt;Frandar Hunding&lt;/a&gt;,\" she says. \"Lists thirty-eight grips, seven hundred and fifty offensive and eighteen hundred defensive positions, and nearly nine thousand moves essential to sword mastery. The average hack-and-slasher knows one grip, which he uses primarily to keep from dropping his blade. He knows one offensive position, facing his target, and one defensive position, fleeing. Of the multitudinous rhythms and inflections of combat, he knows less than one.\n\"The ways of the warrior were never meant to be the easiest path. The archetype of the idiot fighter is as solidly ingrained as that of the brilliant wizard and the shrewd thief, but it was not always so. The figure of the philosopher swordsman, the blade-wielding artist are creatures of the past, together with the &lt;a href=\"swordsinger\"&gt;swordsinger&lt;/a&gt; of the Redguards, who was said to be able to create and wield a blade with but the power of his mind. The future of the intelligent blade-wielder looks bleak in comparison to the glories of the past.\"\nNot wanting to end our interviews on a sour note, I pressed Lady Allena Benoch for advice for young blade-swingers just beginning their careers.\n\"When confronted with a wizard,\" she says, throwing petals of &lt;a href=\"Kanthleaf\"&gt;Kanthleaf&lt;/a&gt; into the Diceto. \"Close the distance and hit 'im hard.\""}

Throughout my studies, particularly in my ongoing research of the mysterious &lt;a href=\"Runestones%20%28Online%29\"&gt;runestones&lt;/a&gt;, a theme of language explicitly interconnected with magic has surfaced with frequency that cannot be ignored. Is the very act of casting ideas into words an invocation? I present here evidence that may just support this admittedly radical position, which I hope the &lt;a href=\"sapiarchs\"&gt;sapiarchs&lt;/a&gt; of the &lt;a href=\"Crystal%20Tower%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Crystal Tower&lt;/a&gt; will be enticed to expound upon or refute.\nLet us begin with the runestones of &lt;a href=\"Enchanting%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Enchanting&lt;/a&gt;. Each is marked with a symbol consisting of syllables arranged together. Alone, a rune is inert, but magical potential is unleashed when combined with others in the appropriate syntax. The full form, the complete expression, conveys magic. One does not even need to fully understand the language to unlock the power it contains\u2014not enough words exist or are known to truly speak it, but by studying &lt;a href=\"glyphs\"&gt;glyphs&lt;/a&gt; and combining runestones, it is possible to grasp enough of the raw concepts to utilize it. The language itself is undeniably connected in a fundamental way to magical energies, though its origin remains a mystery.\nAs an aside for prospective students of Enchanting, do not become discouraged when you encounter a rune you are unable to decipher. Only through repetition of words and phrases you have learned and the extraction of runes from glyphs will you obtain the knowledge you need to master more difficult runes. Be patient and work with other students to create and deconstruct glyphs to gain more insight into their interplay and true meaning.\nLanguage, specifically the written word, is also of critical importance to the &lt;a href=\"Altmer%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Altmer&lt;/a&gt;. Not only does it preserve our history, but it captures and defines our auspicious lineage and ensures that every &lt;a href=\"Mer\"&gt;Mer&lt;/a&gt; knows his or her place in the hierarchy. It is no accident that Altmeri society is the most orderly and structured in Tamriel\u2014it is the will of &lt;a href=\"Xarxes\"&gt;Xarxes&lt;/a&gt; himself. The scholar-priests of the divine scribe, secretive though they are, are said to preserve an ancient tongue long forgotten to any but their order. In &lt;a href=\"Helaameril\"&gt;Helaameril&lt;/a&gt;'s \"&lt;a href=\"Conversations%20with%20the%20Etymon-Binders\"&gt;Conversations with the Etymon-Binders&lt;/a&gt;,\" an anonymous scribe hints at tomes capable of producing tastes, smells, and dancing images, and texts that can be read by any gazing upon them\u2014even the unlettered. Another form of word-magic, if Helaameril is to be believed.\nConsider even what may seem mundane: the speech of a great general upon the morn of battle that rouses his troops to perform incredible deeds, the songs of a master bard that inspire emotion, the calming tone of a mother to her child. Are there traces of magic in everyday exertions of will through speech or writing? It seems possible that some remnant of ancient pre-&lt;a href=\"Dawn%20Era\"&gt;Dawn&lt;/a&gt; power lingers on here, though it has grown faint. There is even more evidence to support this throughout the history of Tamriel\u2014far too much to detail here\u2014and I look forward to debating this theory among my peers."}

And she gave birth to &lt;a href=\"Nirni\"&gt;Nirni&lt;/a&gt;, the majestic sands and lush forests. And she gave birth to &lt;a href=\"Azurah\"&gt;Azurah&lt;/a&gt;, the dusk and the dawn.\nAnd from the beginning, Nirni and Azurah fought for their mother's favor.\nAhnurr caught Fadomai while she was still birthing, and he was angry. Ahnurr struck Fadomai and she fled to birth the last of her litter far away in the &lt;a href=\"Void\"&gt;Great Darkness&lt;/a&gt;. Fadomai's children heard what had happened, and they all came to be with her and protect her from Ahnurr's anger.\nAnd Fadomai gave birth to &lt;a href=\"Lorkhaj\"&gt;Lorkhaj&lt;/a&gt;, the last of her litter, in the Great Darkness. And the &lt;a href=\"Heart%20of%20Lorkhaj\"&gt;Heart of Lorkhaj&lt;/a&gt; was filled with the Great Darkness. And when he was born, the Great Darkness knew its name and it was &lt;a href=\"Namiira\"&gt;Namiira&lt;/a&gt;.\nAnd Fadomai knew her time was near. Fadomai said:\n\"&lt;a href=\"Ja-Kha%27jay\"&gt;Ja-Kha'jay&lt;/a&gt;, to you Fadomai gives the Lattice, for what is steadier than the phases of the moons? Your eternal motions will protect us from Ahnurr's anger.\" And the moons left to take their place in the heavens. And Ahnurr growled and shook the Great Darkness, but he could not cross the Lattice.\nAnd Fadomai said:\n\"Nirni, to you Fadomai leaves her greatest gift. You will give birth to many people as Fadomai gave birth today.\" When Nirni saw that Azurah had nothing, Nirni left smiling.\nAnd all Fadomai's children left except Azurah. And Fadomai said, \"To you, my favored daughter, Fadomai leaves her greatest gift. To you Fadomai leaves her secrets.\" And Fadomai told her favored daughter three things.\nAnd Fadomai said, \"When Nirni is filled with her children, take one of them and change them. Make the fastest, cleverest, most beautiful people, and call them &lt;a href=\"Khajiit\"&gt;Khajiit&lt;/a&gt;.\"\nAnd Fadomai said, \"The Khajiit must be the best climbers, for if &lt;a href=\"Masser\"&gt;Masser&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Secunda\"&gt;Secunda&lt;/a&gt; fail, they must climb Khenarthi's breath to set the moons back in their courses.\"\nAnd Fadomai said, \"The Khajiit must be the best deceivers, for they must always hide their nature from the children of Ahnurr.\"\nAnd Fadomai said, \"The Khajiit must be the best survivors, for Nirni will be jealous, and she will make the sands harsh and the forests unforgiving, and the Khajiit will always be hungry and at war with Nirni.\"\nAnd with these words, Fadomai died.\nAfter many phases, Nirni came to Lorkhaj and said, \"Lorkhaj, Fadomai told me to give birth to many children, but there is no place for them.\"\nAnd Lorkhaj said, \"Lorkhaj makes a place for children and Lorkhaj puts you there so you can give birth.\" But the Heart of Lorkhaj was filled with the Great Darkness, and Lorkhaj tricked his siblings so that they were forced into this new place with Nirni. And many of Fadomai's children escaped and became the stars. And many of Fadomai's children died to make Nirni's path stable. And the survivors stayed and punished Lorkhaj.\nThe children of Fadomai tore out the Heart of Lorkhaj and hid it deep within Nirni. And they said, \"We curse you, noisy Lorkhaj, to walk Nirni for many phases.\"\nBut Nirni soon forgave Lorkhaj for Nirni could make children. And she filled herself with children, but cried because her favorite children, the forest people, did not know their shape.\nAnd Azurah came to her and said, \"Poor Nirni, stop your tears. Azurah makes for you a gift of a new people.\" Nirni stopped weeping, and Azurah spoke the First Secret to the Moons and they parted and let Azurah pass. And Azurah took some forest people who were torn between man and beast, and she placed them in the best deserts and forests on Nirni. And Azurah in her wisdom made them of many shapes, one for every purpose. And Azurah named them Khajiit and told them her Second Secret and taught them the value of secrets. And Azurah bound the new Khajiit to the Lunar Lattice, as is proper for Nirni's secret defenders. Then Azurah spoke the Third Secret, and the Moons shone down on the marshes and their light became &lt;a href=\"Moon%20Sugar\"&gt;sugar&lt;/a&gt;.\nBut &lt;a href=\"Y%27ffer\"&gt;Y'ffer&lt;/a&gt; heard the First Secret and snuck in behind Azurah. And Y'ffer could not appreciate secrets, and he told Nirni of Azurah's trick. So Nirni made the deserts hot and the sands biting. And Nirni made the forests wet and filled with poisons. And Nirni thanked Y'ffer and let him change the forest people also. And Y'ffer did not have Azurah's subtle wisdom, so Y'ffer made the forest people &lt;a href=\"Elves\"&gt;Elves&lt;/a&gt; always and never beasts. And Y'ffer named them &lt;a href=\"Bosmer\"&gt;Bosmer&lt;/a&gt;. And from that moment they were no longer in the same litter as the Khajiit.\nAnd because Y'ffer had no appreciation for secrets, he shouted the First Secret across all the heavens with his last breath so that all of Fadomai's children could cross the Lattice. But Azurah, in her wisdom, closed the ears of angry Ahnurr and noisy Lorkhaj so they alone did not hear the word."}

Fadomai said:\n\"&lt;a href=\"Ja-Kha%27jay\"&gt;Ja-Kha'jay&lt;/a&gt;, to you Fadomai gives the Lattice, for what is steadier than the phases of the moons? Your eternal motions will protect us from &lt;a href=\"Ahnurr\"&gt;Ahnurr&lt;/a&gt;'s anger.\" And the moons left to take their place in the heavens. And Ahnurr growled and shook the Great Darkness, but he could not cross the Lattice.\nAnd Fadomai said:\n\"&lt;a href=\"Nirni\"&gt;Nirni&lt;/a&gt;, to you Fadomai leaves her greatest gift. You will give birth to many people as Fadomai gave birth today.\" When Nirni saw that &lt;a href=\"Azurah\"&gt;Azurah&lt;/a&gt; had nothing, Nirni left smiling.\nAnd all Fadomai's children left except Azurah. And Fadomai said, \"To you, my favored daughter, Fadomai leaves her greatest gift. To you Fadomai leaves her secrets.\" And Fadomai told her favored daughter three things.\nAnd Fadomai said, \"When Nirni is filled with her children, take one of them and change them. Make the fastest, cleverest, most beautiful people, and call them &lt;a href=\"Khajiit\"&gt;Khajiit&lt;/a&gt;.\"\nAnd Fadomai said, \"The Khajiit must be the best climbers, for if &lt;a href=\"Masser\"&gt;Masser&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Secunda\"&gt;Secunda&lt;/a&gt; fail, they must climb &lt;a href=\"Khenarthi\"&gt;Khenarthi&lt;/a&gt;'s breath to set the moons back in their courses.\"\nAnd Fadomai said, \"The Khajiit must be the best deceivers, for they must always hide their nature from the children of Ahnurr.\"\nAnd Fadomai said, \"The Khajiit must be the best survivors, for Nirni will be jealous, and she will make the sands harsh and the forests unforgiving, and the Khajiit will always be hungry and at war with Nirni.\"\nAnd with these words, Fadomai died.\nAfter many phases, Nirni came to &lt;a href=\"Lorkhaj\"&gt;Lorkhaj&lt;/a&gt; and said, \"Lorkhaj, Fadomai told me to give birth to many children, but there is no place for them.\"\nAnd Lorkhaj said, \"Lorkhaj makes a place for children and Lorkhaj puts you there so you can give birth.\" But the Heart of Lorkhaj was filled with the &lt;a href=\"Void\"&gt;Great Darkness&lt;/a&gt;, and Lorkhaj tricked his siblings so that they were forced into this new place with Nirni. And many of Fadomai's children escaped and became the stars. And many of Fadomai's children died to make Nirni's path stable. And the survivors stayed and punished Lorkhaj.\nThe children of Fadomai tore out the &lt;a href=\"Heart%20of%20Lorkhaj\"&gt;Heart of Lorkhaj&lt;/a&gt; and hid it deep within Nirni. And they said, \"We curse you, noisy Lorkhaj, to walk Nirni for many phases.\"\nBut Nirni soon forgave Lorkhaj for Nirni could make children. And she filled herself with children, but cried because her favorite children, the forest people, did not know their shape.\nAnd Azurah came to her and said, \"Poor Nirni, stop your tears. Azurah makes for you a gift of a new people.\" Nirni stopped weeping, and Azurah spoke the First Secret to the Moons and they parted and let Azurah pass. And Azurah took some forest people who were torn between man and beast, and she placed them in the best deserts and forests on Nirni. And Azurah in her wisdom made them of many shapes, one for every purpose. And Azurah named them Khajiit and told them her Second Secret and taught them the value of secrets. And Azurah bound the new Khajiit to the Lunar Lattice, as is proper for Nirni's secret defenders. Then Azurah spoke the Third Secret, and the Moons shone down on the marshes and their light became &lt;a href=\"Moon%20Sugar\"&gt;sugar&lt;/a&gt;.\nBut &lt;a href=\"Y%27ffer\"&gt;Y'ffer&lt;/a&gt; heard the First Secret and snuck in behind Azurah. And Y'ffer could not appreciate secrets, and he told Nirni of Azurah's trick. So Nirni made the deserts hot and the sands biting. And Nirni made the forests wet and filled with poisons. And Nirni thanked Y'ffer and let him change the forest people also. And Y'ffer did not have Azurah's subtle wisdom, so Y'ffer made the forest people &lt;a href=\"Elves\"&gt;Elves&lt;/a&gt; always and never beasts. And Y'ffer named them &lt;a href=\"Bosmer\"&gt;Bosmer&lt;/a&gt;. And from that moment they were no longer in the same litter as the Khajiit.\nAnd because Y'ffer had no appreciation for secrets, he shouted the First Secret across all the heavens with his last breath so that all of Fadomai's children could cross the Lattice. But Azurah, in her wisdom, closed the ears of angry Ahnurr and noisy Lorkhaj so they alone did not hear the word."}

I suppose I did, sort of, but the way things turned out, it wasn't at all the way I imagined. &lt;a href=\"Meridia%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Meridia&lt;/a&gt; said I was her vessel.

My light, it's fading. I can feel the darkness getting closer, pressing in. I expect that once the light goes out, that will be the end.\nI need to tell you something about Meridia. She's a deceiver. She promised that if I served her faithfully, I'd earn my freedom. She never told me that freedom was just another word for the void. Don't trust her. Don't trust any of the Daedric Princes. Not ever.\nI've found peace though. Meridia gave me a chance to see the world, and those I care about, one last time. To save those I loved.

Perhaps we'll see each other again, in another place, another time. I probably won't be the version of myself that's writing these words, though. That me will be gone. I can live with that.\nI only wish I could have spent more time with everybody. Had a few more adventures. Ordered those drinks like we always talked about.\nI hope my friends find peace, happiness, and love. They deserve what I could never have. If anyone ever finds this book, know that I will never forget those I named herein. And, if you find them, and I pray that you do, tell them this.\nProtect the ones you love. Hold them close. Cherish their every moment. Make them laugh, and laugh with them. Smile together and never, ever, forget that the moments you have are so very precious.\nOh, and tell them not to forget me, either. I mean, I am a legend, as far as I know.\nThe polite, handsome, and humble knight,\n&lt;a href=\"Darien%20Gautier\"&gt;Darien Gautier&lt;/a&gt;"}

If this ore proves useful or valuable, we'll need to clear the trolls out of there.\nTests:\nHard to determine the actual properties of this mysterious metal. It appears to have thin veins of silver running through its distinctive bluish tint.\nThe ore resonates with an almost musical tone when tapped with a silver tool. An iron tool produced a more discordant tone.\nAdditional Testing:\nThe ore is highly resistant to chipping. A few chips were finally produced and ground into a powder. Unfortuately, &lt;a href=\"Thelm%20Blue-Sky\"&gt;Thelm&lt;/a&gt; destroyed several hours' work with a mighty sneeze that scattered the blue, glowing residue.\nAdditional analysis is needed, but I believe that grinding the ore may produce a material that can be used as an alloy in weapon crafting. This will be extremely important if the ore is determined to have some sort of magical property. The &lt;a href=\"alchemist%20Aleeto\"&gt;alchemist Aleeto&lt;/a&gt; will be interested in this. She'll want to see a sample of the ore immediately."}

No, I dare not even put the thought to paper.\nHe did it. He must have. That monster killed my son, and now he looks at me with those hate-filled eyes and a mocking smirk. He despises my alchemical arts so much, he took my son from me to punish me.\nI never brewed poison before, but I know how it's done. I know how to bottle death.

Once &lt;a href=\"Fort%20Neugrad\"&gt;Fort Neugrad&lt;/a&gt; has been captured for the &lt;a href=\"Stormcloaks\"&gt;Stormcloaks&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;a href=\"Civil%20War\"&gt;Civil War&lt;/a&gt;, the Dragonborn can buy the house, &lt;a href=\"Hjerim\"&gt;Hjerim&lt;/a&gt;, for 12,000 , although he will &lt;a href=\"Hjerim%23Bugs\"&gt;accept&lt;/a&gt; 8,000 or more, and also hands out the &lt;a href=\"Windhelm%20Home%20Decorating%20Guide\"&gt;Windhelm Home Decorating Guide&lt;/a&gt; upon purchase.\nHe is essential in the quest \"&lt;a href=\"Blood%20on%20the%20Ice\"&gt;Blood on the Ice&lt;/a&gt;,\" as the &lt;a href=\"Hold%20Guard\"&gt;guards&lt;/a&gt; will only let the Dragonborn investigate if Jorleif permits it. According to the Skyrim Strategy Guide, Jorleif is supposed to be replaced by &lt;a href=\"Captain%20Lonely-Gale\"&gt;Captain Lonely-Gale&lt;/a&gt; as steward if Windhelm has fallen to Imperial control, but sometimes Jorleif still remains the steward.\nInteractions.\n&lt;a href=\"Blood%20on%20the%20Ice\"&gt;Blood on the Ice&lt;/a&gt;.\nAlthough the guards want the Dragonborn's help, they can go to Jorleif and receive official permission to do so. Throughout the quest, he can be returned to in order to obtain clues on what to do next. Eventually, &lt;a href=\"Wuunferth%20the%20Unliving\"&gt;Wuunferth the Unliving&lt;/a&gt; will become the prime suspect of the murders. The Dragonborn can report this to Jorleif, who will then order a guard to follow him and promptly arrest Wuunferth. Once the &lt;a href=\"Calixto%20Corrium\"&gt;real killer&lt;/a&gt; has been killed, the Dragonborn returns to Jorleif a final time to end the quest. If Wuunferth was wronfully imprisoned as a result, he will then be released.\n&lt;a href=\"Bounty%20Quests\"&gt;Bounty Quests&lt;/a&gt;.\nTalking to Jorlief can start miscellaneous Bounty Quests in the &lt;a href=\"Holds\"&gt;Hold&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"Eastmarch%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Eastmarch&lt;/a&gt;. Alternatively, innkeepers will begin these quests, although Jorleif must be reported to in order to claim the reward regardless.

It was built after the discovery of the &lt;a href=\"Skyforge%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Skyforge&lt;/a&gt;.\nFirst visit.\nOn the &lt;a href=\"Last%20Dragonborn\"&gt;Dragonborn's&lt;/a&gt; first visit to Jorrvaskr, the line \"Those two at it again?\" are the first words they hear when entering. &lt;a href=\"Njada%20Stonearm\"&gt;Njada Stonearm&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Athis\"&gt;Athis&lt;/a&gt; will be in a brawl (fist fight), and the rest of the Companions and other characters will be watching. Njada will eventually win the fight.\nHistory.\nAccording to local legend, Jorrvaskr is the oldest building in &lt;a href=\"Whiterun%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Whiterun&lt;/a&gt;. It once existed by itself on the mountain, with the rest of the town springing up around it over the centuries.\nJorrvaskr itself was originally a &lt;a href=\"Jorrvaskr%20%28Ship%29\"&gt;longboat&lt;/a&gt; made for the &lt;a href=\"The%20Return\"&gt;Return&lt;/a&gt; of the &lt;a href=\"Five%20Hundred%20Companions\"&gt;Five Hundred Companions&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"Ysgramor\"&gt;Ysgramor&lt;/a&gt;. Its &lt;a href=\"Captain%20%28Lore%29\"&gt;captain&lt;/a&gt; was &lt;a href=\"Jeek%20of%20the%20River\"&gt;Jeek of the River&lt;/a&gt;, and its crew consisted of twenty-two men.\nUpon arrival in Skyrim, Ysgramor commanded that his men go forth and settle in this new land. Jeek of the River and his crew split from the &lt;a href=\"Circle%20of%20Captains\"&gt;Circle of Captains&lt;/a&gt; and traveled southwards towards the area that was later named &lt;a href=\"Whiterun%20Hold\"&gt;Whiterun Hold&lt;/a&gt;.\nIt was there they discovered a strange monument that later became known as the Skyforge. Jeek and his crew decided that the mysterious Skyforge could be of use to them. The wasteland surrounding the Skyforge was fit for harvest, and so began the labors of &lt;a href=\"Menro\"&gt;Menro&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Manwe\"&gt;Manwe&lt;/a&gt;, whose eager hands again laid to the &lt;a href=\"Atmora\"&gt;Atmora&lt;/a&gt;n wood which had born them all across the sea, their boat, Jorrvaskr, becoming their shelter.\nReverence.\nJorrvaskr is a place of honor and courage, and to walk into the hall is to proclaim, \"I am a warrior, and will die as I lived\u2014in glorious battle!\" It is also the location where the Dragonborn may join the Companions as a &lt;a href=\"Shield-Siblings\"&gt;Shield-Brother or Sister&lt;/a&gt;.\nArchitectural design.\nConstruction.\nJorrvaskr was built from the &lt;a href=\"Jorrvaskr%20%28Ship%29\"&gt;timbers of the ship&lt;/a&gt; that brought some of Ysgramor's Five Hundred Companions to Skyrim from &lt;a href=\"Atmora\"&gt;Atmora&lt;/a&gt;. The design is influenced by this; the roof resembles the hull of one of their vessels.\nLayout.\nThe exterior of the building features two front doors and a rear outside dining and training area. Inside, the main floor is dominated by the mead hall and fire pit where the Companions can be found throughout the day. At one end of the hall is a sparring area, and around the sides are various shelves stocked with books and food.\nDisplayed on the wall here are the shards of &lt;a href=\"Wuuthrad%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Wuuthrad&lt;/a&gt;, a powerful weapon wielded by their founder, &lt;a href=\"Ysgramor\"&gt;Ysgramor&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe door at the north end leads to a bedroom. The stairs at the south end lead down to the living quarters. Upon joining the Companions, the Dragonborn is given a cot in a room shared with the other newest recruits. After completing the quest \"&lt;a href=\"Glory%20of%20the%20Dead\"&gt;Glory of the Dead&lt;/a&gt;,\" the Harbinger's bedroom (formerly Kodlak's living area) is available for use. The chest and barrel in Kodlak's quarters in Jorrvaskr in Whiterun can reset, thus permanently deleting all items placed within them after a certain period of time. The wardrobe, cupboard and other containers do not, however.\nCarved out of the living rock behind Jorrvaskr is the &lt;a href=\"Skyforge%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Skyforge&lt;/a&gt;, where the arms and armor of the Companions are crafted by &lt;a href=\"Eorlund%20Gray-Mane\"&gt;Eorlund Gray-Mane&lt;/a&gt;, and below that is the entrance to &lt;a href=\"The%20Underforge\"&gt;The Underforge&lt;/a&gt;."}
