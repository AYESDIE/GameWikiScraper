This is the second quest pertaining to the &lt;a href=\"Thieves%20Guild%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Thieves Guild&lt;/a&gt;, acquired from &lt;a href=\"Brynjolf%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Brynjolf&lt;/a&gt;.\nBackground.\n\"Brynjolf has promised me more work if I'm able to locate him at a tavern called the Ragged Flaggon. Judging from the dangerous nature of it location, it seems as though he's having me perform some type of initiation, but I can't be certain.\"\nWalkthrough.\nThe Ratway.\nThe Ratway's entrance is located on the lower levels of &lt;a href=\"Riften%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Riften&lt;/a&gt;. Once inside, there will be two &lt;a href=\"Bandits%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;bandits&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Drahff\"&gt;Drahff&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Hewnon%20Black-Skeever\"&gt;Hewnon Black-Skeever&lt;/a&gt;. After they are dealt with, the &lt;a href=\"Last%20Dragonborn\"&gt;Dragonborn&lt;/a&gt; will enter into a room. They must either pick the lock on the door to the left or take the path to the right. &lt;a href=\"The%20Ragged%20Flagon\"&gt;The Ragged Flagon&lt;/a&gt; can be entered after continuing down the path; Brynjolf can be found conversing at the bar here.\n&lt;a href=\"Vekel%20the%20Man\"&gt;Vekel the Man&lt;/a&gt;: \"Give it up, Brynjolf... those days are over.\"\nBrynjolf: \"I'm telling you, this one is different...\"\n&lt;a href=\"Dirge\"&gt;Dirge&lt;/a&gt;: \"We've all heard that one before, Bryn! Quit kidding yourself.\"\nVekel: \"It's time to face the truth, old friend. You, Vex, Mercer... you're all part of a dying breed. Things are changing!\"\nBrynjolf: \"Dying breed, eh? Well what do you call that then!\"\nAt this point Brynjolf will turn around and, if you are close enough, approach to say, \"Well, well... Color me impressed lad/lass. I wasn't certain I'd ever see you again!\"\nAnd you'll have three options. If you say that you got through the Ratway easily, he will be doubly impressed, saying, \"Reliable and headstrong? You're turning out to be quite the prize!\" If you claim you nearly died or point out the less-than-lovely state of the Guild, he will be annoyed, saying, \"No risk, no reward. That's the way it goes, so you better get used to it.\" or \"If you were expecting a palace, then maybe you're not cut out for this line of work. Our methods involve secrecy and discretion.\", respectively.\nHe will instruct the Dragonborn to collect debts from three business owners in Riften. If one chooses to ask Brynjolf for advice, he will suggest some alternative ways to collect the debt. Exit the Ragged Flagon by the front door, then go through the second archway on the right wall. Pull the lever to drop the draw bridge across the gap and follow the path to exit the Ratway.\nCollecting the Debt.\nThe Dragonborn may collect the debts in any order, but will quickly discover that none of the business owners are willing to pay up; the Dragonborn may opt to brawl the owner for the money, or negotiate a more peaceful solution using Brynjolf's advice. Additionally, the final business owner may hear about the Dragonborn's activities in advance and decide to pay off their debt immediately, without conflict or need to perform the optional objective.\nKeerava's debt in &lt;a href=\"The%20Bee%20and%20Barb\"&gt;The Bee and Barb&lt;/a&gt;.\nKeerava is the female &lt;a href=\"Argonians%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Argonian&lt;/a&gt; behind the counter at the Bee and Barb. Bringing up her debt to her will result in her becoming upset, telling the Dragonborn to go away, and that Brynjolf will not be getting anything; the Dragonborn may leave the conversation or choose to brawl her. Talking to &lt;a href=\"Talen-Jei\"&gt;Talen-Jei&lt;/a&gt;, a male Argonian and Keerava's lover, will reveal information about Keerava's family's farm in &lt;a href=\"Morrowind\"&gt;Morrowind&lt;/a&gt;. Going back to Keerava and threatening to visit the farm will convince her to pay the owed gold. If she is visited third after dealing with Bersi and Haelga, she will pay up without having to use the threat against her.\nBersi Honey-Hand's debt in &lt;a href=\"The%20Pawned%20Prawn\"&gt;The Pawned Prawn&lt;/a&gt;.\nUpon entering the Pawned Prawn, one will be greeted by Bersi Honey-Hand. Talking to him and bringing up his debt will result in him becoming defensive. One can choose to either walk away from the conversation or brawl him for the gold. If one chooses to walk away, they can then destroy Bersi's dwarven urn under the window. After it has been destroyed, he will agree to pay. If he is visited third, he will immediately pay up without having to destroy the urn or brawl him for it after learning of what happened with Haelga and Keerava.\nHaelga's debt in &lt;a href=\"Haelga%27s%20Bunkhouse\"&gt;Haelga's Bunkhouse&lt;/a&gt;.\nUpon entering Haelga's Bunkhouse, the Dragonborn will be rudely greeted. Speaking to Haelga and bringing up her debt will make her angry. The Dragonborn can either walk away or brawl her. If one chooses to walk away, Haelga responds by saying that she will not pay. To solve this, in the right corner is a &lt;a href=\"Dibella%20Statue\"&gt;statue of Dibella&lt;/a&gt;, the goddess which Haelga devoutly worships. Stealing and presenting the statue to her will result in Haelga begging the Dragonborn to not damage the statue and agreeing to pay. The Dragonborn can also commit a crime that forces them to go to jail, and talk to her afterwards. She will ask the Dragonborn to stop committing crimes and will agree to pay. If she is visited third after dealing with Bersi and Keerava, she will pay up without a fuss and needing to steal her statue to bribe her.\nGetting back to Brynjolf.\nOnce the debts have been collected, return to Brynjolf in the Ragged Flagon. He will invite the Dragonborn to follow him to the cistern, where the &lt;a href=\"Guildmaster\"&gt;Guildmaster&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Mercer%20Frey\"&gt;Mercer Frey&lt;/a&gt;, will give the next quest, \"&lt;a href=\"Loud%20and%20Clear\"&gt;Loud and Clear&lt;/a&gt;,\" and welcome the Dragonborn to the guild.\nRewards.\nAfter completing the quest and accepting the follow up, \"Loud and Clear,\" a few perks are gained:"}

As the rules of the guild forbid killing, the plan is to have him restationed to &lt;a href=\"Anvil%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;Anvil&lt;/a&gt; where he can do little harm to the guild.\nWalkthrough.\n&lt;a href=\"Count\"&gt;Count&lt;/a&gt;ess &lt;a href=\"Millona%20Umbranox\"&gt;Millona Umbranox&lt;/a&gt; in Anvil is looking for a new Captain of the Guard. As this is a perfect opportunity to get rid of Lex from the &lt;a href=\"Waterfront\"&gt;Waterfront&lt;/a&gt;, S'Krivva has made a plan. She wants the &lt;a href=\"Hero%20of%20Kvatch\"&gt;Hero&lt;/a&gt; to steal the \"&lt;a href=\"Forged%20List%20of%20Candidates\"&gt;Forged List of Candidates&lt;/a&gt;\" for the new position in Anvil and rewrite Lex in as the top candidate. The list is currently in possession of &lt;a href=\"Dairihill\"&gt;Dairihill&lt;/a&gt;, the castle steward.\nGo to Anvil and ask the beggars about the castle. It may cost a little but if the Hero talks to &lt;a href=\"Penniless%20Olvus\"&gt;Penniless Olvus&lt;/a&gt; (typically through the main gate on the left), he will tell them for free. Any beggar will say that &lt;a href=\"Orrin\"&gt;Orrin&lt;/a&gt;, the blacksmith in the castle, is associated with the Thieves Guild:\nDairihill's Office \"To be honest, I couldn't give you directions to any special room in the castle. Anyone in the castle can tell you though. However, I'll tell you for free that there are many secrets in that Castle. There are secret ways, and secret people. Find the blacksmith.\"\nTalk to Orrin in the castle and he will show the Hero a secret passageway. Traverse through the secret passage. At the end is a door to be picked and on getting out of the secret passage, they will need to pick another door into Dairihill's room, hopefully when she is asleep which usually is after midnight. Detect life and invisibility spells will be useful here as she is sometimes sitting at her desk. If caught, simply run up and pick one final lock on her desk to steal the \"&lt;a href=\"List%20of%20Candidates\"&gt;List of Candidates&lt;/a&gt;\". If arrested the \"List of Candidates\" will not be removed from the inventory even though it is considered a stolen item because it is a quest item.\nWith the note in hand, the Hero must forge a new one. Bribe the beggars and they will tell them about the &lt;a href=\"Abandoned%20House%20%28Anvil%29\"&gt;Abandoned House&lt;/a&gt;. It is rumored that a Master Forger lives there:\nMaster forger \"Well, only because I like you. Look for a man known only as the Stranger. He lives here in Anvil, down the road from the Chapel of Dibella.\"\nFollow the quest marker to a man called &lt;a href=\"Corvus%20Umbranox\"&gt;The Stranger&lt;/a&gt;. Though he will not tell the cost he will forge the note for 500 gold and it will take 24 hours.\nAfter getting the \"Forged List of Candidates\" from The Stranger, the Hero needs to seal it using the Imperial Legion Seal to make it look official. Go to the &lt;a href=\"Imperial%20City%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;Imperial City&lt;/a&gt; and enter the &lt;a href=\"Imperial%20City%20Prison%20District\"&gt;Prison District&lt;/a&gt;. Wait until after midnight to sneak into the &lt;a href=\"Imperial%20Legion%20Offices\"&gt;Imperial Legion Offices&lt;/a&gt; to avoid detection. On the desk of the commander in the northern room, the Hero will find &lt;a href=\"Imperial%20Legion%20Seal\"&gt;the seal&lt;/a&gt;: use it and get out. Or, pick the Imperial Legion Commander's locked chest (to the left of the desk) and steal the leveled items within.\nGo back to Countess Umbranox in Anvil and deliver the message. Wait until she is in the audience chamber. While one can approach her during her meals, she will not accept any official documentation during that time. Once the countess receives the letter, she gladly accepts Hieronymus Lex as her new Captain of the Guard. Before leaving with Lex's &lt;a href=\"Transfer%20Orders\"&gt;Transfer Orders&lt;/a&gt;, collect a 20 gold tip from Dairihill along with a nasty remark about how her cousin was supposed to assume Lex's new position.\nGo back to the Imperial City and find Lex. As Lex does wander from time to time, it is best to follow the marker to get to him. Give him the Transfer Orders and he will rant that the &lt;a href=\"The%20Gray%20Fox%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;Gray Fox&lt;/a&gt; had something to do with it but he is honor bound to leave, admitting defeat. Return to S'Krivva in Bravil and collect the reward."}

The Direnni derived the bulk of their power from their traffickings with &lt;a href=\"Daedra\"&gt;Daedra&lt;/a&gt;, a very profitable but risky path to success. Chimere was perhaps the cleverest and most ambitious of the Direnni summoners. He dared to scheme against &lt;a href=\"Lord%20Dagon\"&gt;Lord Dagon&lt;/a&gt;, and won. When his trick succeeded, Dagon was cast into &lt;a href=\"Oblivion%20%28Realm%29\"&gt;Oblivion&lt;/a&gt;. However, in the instant of his betrayal, Dagon struck out against the mortal who tricked him. Chimere's pact assured that he would live forever in his home town among the happy voices of his friends and countrymen. Twisting the literal words of Chimere's pact, Dagon scooped up tiny &lt;a href=\"Caecilly%20Island\"&gt;Caecilly Island&lt;/a&gt; (a small island off the coast of &lt;a href=\"Northmoor\"&gt;Northmoor&lt;/a&gt;) and hurled in into the void. All Chimere's friends and countrymen were instantly killed, though the sounds of their voices remained to torment Chimere's memory. Chimere was condemned to live forever, to grow progressively old and crippled with arthritis, and to contemplate the tragic consequences of his defiance of fate and fortune in cheating a Daedra Lord.\n&lt;a href=\"Cuirass%20of%20the%20Savior%27s%20Hide\"&gt;Armor of the Saviour's Hide&lt;/a&gt;:\nCreated by the Daedra Lord &lt;a href=\"Malacath\"&gt;Malacath&lt;/a&gt;, this armor has the marvelous property of turning the blow of an oathbreaker. Chimere tricked Dagon into swearing an oath against the Powers which he had no intention of keeping. The Hide of the Savior turned Dagon's titanic fury long enough for Chimere to deliver his own attack -- an incantation invoked upon Dagon's \"Protonymic\" (i.e., True Name). Unfortunately, like many of Malacath's gifts, the armor is a mixed blessing. It also makes its wearer exceptionally vulnerable to magical attacks, so one should only wear it for particular occasions.\nDagon's &lt;a href=\"Protonymic\"&gt;Protonymic&lt;/a&gt;:\nChimere used Dagon's Protonymic in an incantation to invoke a sorcery that would gradually drain all of Dagon's power into the void. Chimere miscalculated, however, not realizing that Dagon's resistance could slow the draining of his power, even if it could not stop it. As a result, Dagon had the time to curse Chimere with a literal fulfillment of the terms of his bargain with Chimere. Rather than let his power drain into the void, Dagon cast it all into his curse. As a result, Caecilly Island was cast into the void, all its citizens were horribly slain, and Chimere was condemned to live forever among the ruins of his greatest ambition.\nRituals of the Hunt:\nThe Chapel of the Innocent Quarry: Chimere believes that Dagon had Caecilly Island established as the site of the Chapel of the Innocent Quarry to personally mock and torment Chimere. The green crystal structure was created by enchantments, and is the only building on the island erected since it was ripped from &lt;a href=\"Tamriel\"&gt;Tamriel&lt;/a&gt; and loosed in the void.\nThe Spear:\nSupposedly the &lt;a href=\"Spear%20of%20Bitter%20Mercy%20%28Morrowind%29\"&gt;Spear of Bitter Mercy&lt;/a&gt; used in the &lt;a href=\"Ritual%20of%20the%20Innocent%20Quarry\"&gt;Wild Hunt&lt;/a&gt;s could not be handled by any mortal or immortal save the ones sanctified to the Hunt and bound by its strictures. However, Chimere has determined that though the Spear's power is great, it is not unlimited, and that certain enchanted items -- for instance, the Armor of the Savior's Hide, forged by Malacath -- are sufficient to protect a mortal or immortal bearer from its maleficent energies."}

According to inhabitants of &lt;a href=\"Mournhold%20%28Tribunal%29\"&gt;Mournhold&lt;/a&gt;, Talen Vandas himself died around the same time as his uncle, shortly after the arrival of &lt;a href=\"King%20Hlaalu%20Helseth%20%28Tribunal%29\"&gt;Helseth Hlaalu&lt;/a&gt; in Mournhold.\nIt is rumored that King Llethan was grooming Talen Vandas as his successor on the throne. Thus, he would have been a rival to Helseth Hlaalu's ambitions to become the future King. Many people in Mournhold suspect his death during a hunt to be arranged by Helseth Hlaalu.\nJudging by the remarks of Mournhold's inhabitants about Talen Vandas, he was greatly loved by the people. They believe that he would have been a good leader. Also, the Queen Mother &lt;a href=\"Barenziah%20%28Tribunal%29\"&gt;Barenziah&lt;/a&gt; considered him to be a smart and charismatic personality who would have made an excellent King.\nFamily.\nTalen Vandas parents are not known, but it is known that Athyn Llethan was his uncle.

Talos is worshipped as the protector and patron of just rulership and civil society, and his Nordic aspect of &lt;a href=\"Ysmir\"&gt;Ysmir&lt;/a&gt; is also seen as the patron of questing heroes.\nBackground.\nTiber Septim conquered all of &lt;a href=\"Tamriel\"&gt;Tamriel&lt;/a&gt; and founded the Third Empire and the Septim Dynasty that would rule it for centuries, marking the beginning of the Third Era. Upon his death, he is believed to have &lt;a href=\"Apotheosis%20%28Term%29\"&gt;ascended to godhood&lt;/a&gt; as the most important Hero-God of Mankind. The &lt;a href=\"Talos%20Cult\"&gt;Talos Cult&lt;/a&gt; has since then been included in the &lt;a href=\"Eight%20Divines\"&gt;Eight Divines&lt;/a&gt; of the Imperial Cult, and is largely followed by members in the &lt;a href=\"Imperial%20Legion\"&gt;Imperial Legion&lt;/a&gt;. Tiber Septim was already venerated in Nibenay prior to his death, however, since the Cult of Tiber Septim was followed in Nibenay 70 years before Tiber Septim died.\nOne theory presumes that Talos absorbed the essences of most Dragons when he became a deity, resulting in Dragons becoming nearly extinct in the Third Era. Talos' own priesthood, however, claims that his divinity was a reward from the Gods themselves upon his death, a belief shared with some of the Nords within Skyrim. A considerable number of Imperials are followers of the Talos cult, which in general is popular among soldiers of the Imperial Legion, colonists, and assimilated foreigners. They follow the cult openly, and hold a strong, and personal, connection to the cult.\nTalos is also referred to as the \"One\" in the \"Eight and One\". Some followers of the original Divines follow the old ways of honoring the Eight, while also giving due to Talos, the \"One\" who ascended. The Nordic aspect of Talos, known as Ysmir, is included in the Nordic Pantheon. After Tiber Septim withstood the Voices of the Greybeards to learn one of their prophecies, many Nords could not look upon the Dragonborn without seeing a Dragon.\nAnother aspect of Tiber Septim is known as &lt;a href=\"Wulf\"&gt;Wulf&lt;/a&gt;, who appeared on &lt;a href=\"Vvardenfell\"&gt;Vvardenfell&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"3E%20427\"&gt;3E 427&lt;/a&gt;. Wulf, at the time, was suspicious regarding the state of rulership in the Third Empire. He stated that both the Empire and the Emperor were old, and was uncertain how much longer the Emperor would hang on. He was suggesting a change in rulership needed to take place, and feared it &lt;a href=\"Stormcrown%20Interregnum\"&gt;could get messy&lt;/a&gt;. This change would eventually take place with the rise of &lt;a href=\"Titus%20Mede%20I\"&gt;Titus Mede I&lt;/a&gt;.\nHistory.\n&lt;a href=\"Third%20Era\"&gt;Third Era&lt;/a&gt;.\nDuring the Third Era, Talos would take a role in history several times. During &lt;a href=\"3E%20427\"&gt;3E 427&lt;/a&gt;, his avatar of Wulf appeared when the &lt;a href=\"Nerevarine\"&gt;Nerevarine&lt;/a&gt; was on his way to defeat &lt;a href=\"Dagoth%20Ur%20%28Character%29\"&gt;Dagoth Ur&lt;/a&gt;. Wulf offered the Nerevarine a &lt;a href=\"Old%20Man%27s%20Lucky%20Coin\"&gt;coin&lt;/a&gt;, which would offer increased luck when accepted.\nTalos' influence would become more apparent during the &lt;a href=\"Oblivion%20Crisis\"&gt;Oblivion Crisis&lt;/a&gt;. In order to recover the &lt;a href=\"Amulet%20of%20Kings\"&gt;Amulet of Kings&lt;/a&gt; from &lt;a href=\"Mankar%20Camoran%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;Mankar Camoran&lt;/a&gt;, the blood of a Divine was required. As no blood of the Eight Divines existed, the encrusted blood on the &lt;a href=\"Armor%20of%20Tiber%20Septim\"&gt;Armor of Tiber Septim&lt;/a&gt; was used in order to meet the requirement. The divinity of Talos would provide more than just this during this time period, however. As &lt;a href=\"Umaril%20the%20Unfeathered\"&gt;Umaril the Unfeathered&lt;/a&gt; had returned to Tamriel, the next Divine Crusader had to follow the &lt;a href=\"Pilgrim%27s%20Path\"&gt;Pilgrim's Path&lt;/a&gt; of the Divines to speak to &lt;a href=\"Pelinal%20Whitestrake\"&gt;Pelinal Whitestrake&lt;/a&gt;. Talos' &lt;a href=\"Wayshrine%20of%20Tiber%20Septim\"&gt;wayshrine&lt;/a&gt; had to be prayed at, proving his divinity. Likewise, where as Pelinal had failed to successfully beat Umaril due to Pelinal's limited power, the &lt;a href=\"Blessing%20of%20Talos%20%28Knights%20of%20the%20Nine%29\"&gt;Blessing of Talos&lt;/a&gt; provided the &lt;a href=\"Hero%20of%20Kvatch\"&gt;Hero of Kvatch&lt;/a&gt; with the means to chase Umaril into the spirit realm and truly defeat him.\n&lt;a href=\"Fourth%20Era\"&gt;Fourth Era&lt;/a&gt;.\nDuring the Fourth Era, a war broke out between the &lt;a href=\"Aldmeri%20Dominion%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Aldmeri Dominion&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Third%20Empire\"&gt;Third Empire&lt;/a&gt;, and this war came to be called the &lt;a href=\"Great%20War\"&gt;Great War&lt;/a&gt;. The war concluded with the signing of the &lt;a href=\"White-Gold%20Concordat\"&gt;White-Gold Concordat&lt;/a&gt;. Two provisions in the treaty had serious impacts on what remained of the Empire, but one of the terms banned the worship of Talos.\nFollowing the &lt;a href=\"Markarth%20Incident\"&gt;Markarth Incident&lt;/a&gt;, the Emperor was forced to permit the Thalmor entry into Skyrim, as the treaty terms had been broken due to the Empire's open acceptance of free Talos worship. The Thalmor Justiciars within Skyrim were tasked with stamping out Talos worship within the land, as they were treaty enforcers. Due to the Talos ban being enforced, a &lt;a href=\"Skyrim%20Civil%20War\"&gt;civil war&lt;/a&gt; would break out within the province. Within the city of &lt;a href=\"Solitude\"&gt;Solitude&lt;/a&gt;, the shrine of Talos was removed due to the Concordat, and within &lt;a href=\"Whiterun\"&gt;Whiterun&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Riften\"&gt;Riften&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Windhelm\"&gt;Windhelm&lt;/a&gt;, the priests of Talos supported Ulfric. Many Nords within the land still revere Talos. If the &lt;a href=\"Stormcloaks\"&gt;Stormcloaks&lt;/a&gt; win the civil war, Talos worship will be permitted within the province again.\nAn Imperial Liason to the Aldmeri Dominion wrote a book in which Talos worship was outlawed due to sincere beliefs. However, as a Liason, their job is to keep relations between the Empire and Dominion intact. Contrary to the claim in the book that the Empire and Thalmor want centuries of peace, it is contradicted by both members of the Legion and the Thalmor.\nIn their persecution of Talos worshippers, agents of the Thalmor are required to provide evidence to the local ruler of a person's worshipping of Talos, after which said person is arrested by the Thalmor. These worshippers are then detained and interrogated by the Thalmor until they renounce their faith in Talos. Sometimes members affiliated with the Stormcloaks are detained by the Thalmor, and interrogated until they confess to worshipping Talos. The Thalmor also perform illegal raids on Talos worshippers in the wilderness, aiming to kill the worshippers instead of converting them."}

The Talos Cult is also said to have a significant charismatic sub-cult.\nBackground.\nThe Cult of Tiber Septim was created in the Nibenay region of Cyrodiil. Contrary to most Imperial cults, which are kept private and practical due to the implementation of restricting policies by the &lt;a href=\"Septim%20Dynasty\"&gt;Septim Emperors&lt;/a&gt;, the Talos Cult was treated differently. The Imperial cult of Tiber Septim was more like Nordic hero-cults and was particularly strong and personal among the Imperial military, provincial colonists and recently assimilated foreigners. The exact number of legionnaires who were members of the cult is unknown. Some say that the cult had some fringe members in the &lt;a href=\"Imperial%20Legion\"&gt;Legions&lt;/a&gt;, whereas others said that the cult had many followers in the Legions. By their own accounts, the Legion followers of the cult worship the true following of the Legions by protecting the glory of Tiber Septim.\nHistory.\n&lt;a href=\"Second%20Era\"&gt;Second Era&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe Cult of Tiber Septim traces its origins back to the area of &lt;a href=\"Nibenay\"&gt;Nibenay&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Cyrodiil\"&gt;Cyrodiil&lt;/a&gt;. When the cult was formed is unknown, but by the time the &lt;a href=\"Pocket%20Guide%20to%20the%20Empire%2C%20First%20Edition\"&gt;First Pocket Guide to the Empire&lt;/a&gt; was written in &lt;a href=\"2E%20864\"&gt;2E 864&lt;/a&gt;, the cult was already considered one of the four most famous cults in Nibenay with the others being the &lt;a href=\"Cult%20of%20the%20Ancestor%20Moth\"&gt;Cult of the Ancestor Moth&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"Cult%20of%20Emperor%20Zero\"&gt;Cult of Emperor Zero&lt;/a&gt; and the Cult of Heroes.\nAfter the death of &lt;a href=\"Tiber%20Septim\"&gt;Tiber Septim&lt;/a&gt;, and his subsequent rise to godhood, the &lt;a href=\"Imperial%20Cult\"&gt;Imperial Cult&lt;/a&gt; included the Talos cult in its veneration.\n&lt;a href=\"Third%20Era\"&gt;Third Era&lt;/a&gt;.\nIn &lt;a href=\"3E%20427\"&gt;3E 427&lt;/a&gt;, on the isle of &lt;a href=\"Vvardenfell\"&gt;Vvardenfell&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"General%20Darius\"&gt;General Darius&lt;/a&gt; of the &lt;a href=\"Deathshead%20Legion\"&gt;Deathshead Legion&lt;/a&gt; received intelligence from informants that there was a conspiracy against Emperor &lt;a href=\"Uriel%20Septim%20VII\"&gt;Uriel Septim VII&lt;/a&gt; among his legionnaires affiliated with the Talos Cult. The conspiracy turned out to be true, as the members of the cult in &lt;a href=\"Gnisis\"&gt;Gnisis&lt;/a&gt; were planning on murdering the Emperor so a strong man could be placed on the &lt;a href=\"Ruby%20Throne\"&gt;Ruby Throne&lt;/a&gt;. The conspiracy was led by &lt;a href=\"Oritius%20Maro\"&gt;Oritius Maro&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Arius%20Rulician\"&gt;Arius Rulician&lt;/a&gt;, but was discovered and terminated."}

By doing so, he will be directed to Oritius Maro in the Gnisis Barracks. Alternatively, the Nerevarine can head directly to Oritius Maro. If Orititius Maro likes the Nerevarine enough, he will give the opportunity to join the Talos Cult. If the Nerevarine accepts, he will get the key to the shrine in the cellar of the Gnisis Barracks. Also, Oritius Maro prompts the Nerevarine to talk to Arius Rulician. The Nerevarine could also try to pickpocket the key from Oritius Maro or lockpick the level 75 lock.\nDown in the cellar, the Nerevarine can either talk to Arius Rulician or proceed straight away. Either way, he will need to pick the lock of the small chest which contains the note from Oritius Maro. Arius Rulician will attack as soon as the Nerevarine is in possession of the note, regardless whether he was successfully sneaking beforehand. When reentering the main room of the barracks, Oritius Maro, too, will attack the Nerevarine. The quest will be completed upon the returning of the Nerevarine to Darius. The Note from Oritius Maro serves as proof of the attempted conspiracy against the &lt;a href=\"Uriel%20Septim%20VII\"&gt;Emperor&lt;/a&gt;. If the Nerevarine escapes the Gnisis Barracks without killing both culprits, he will be sent back by Darius to kill them in punishment of their crime.

I guess no one is above greed and corruption.\"\nAfter Kurog's funeral:\n\"Another king? These Orcs just don't learn their lesson, do they? Ah, well. I suppose Bazrag won't be as bad as Kurog. He couldn't be. At least, I hope he'll do a good job.\"\nIn the main hall:\n\"As soon as I finish this drink, it's back to the Summerset Isles for me. I have so many tales to tell my family. Just imagine, a scribe who helped crown a new Orc king. My sister will never believe it!\"\nConversations.\nAfter speaking with &lt;a href=\"High%20Priestess%20Solgra\"&gt;High Priestess Solgra&lt;/a&gt;:\nHigh Priestess Solgra: \"You two have your orders. Scout the temple exterior. The others will join you shortly.\"\nTalviah Aliaria: \"Finally! Something to do that doesn't involve a message!\"\nOverlooking &lt;a href=\"Paragon%27s%20Remembrance\"&gt;Paragon's Remembrance&lt;/a&gt;:\nEveli Sharp-Arrow: \"The entrance has to be somewhere in those hills.\"\nTalviah Aliaria: \"It's certainly well hidden. If Bazrag lied to us, then we're probably about to meet with horrible, horrible deaths.\"\nIn disguise:\nEveli Sharp-Arrow: \"This illusion is so weird. It looks like I'm wearing robes, but I feel so \u2026 unencumbered.\"\nFlies-In-Wind: \"This is like the time I licked one of our great hists. I feel so \u2026 exposed.\"\nTalviah Aliaria: \"It's merely an illusion bound to the amulet. Nothing to be concerned about. I've seen these used at festivals and grand balls back home.\"\nEveli Sharp-Arrow: \"I wonder if they come in different colors?\"\nAfter agreeing to split up:\nEveli Sharp-Arrow: \"Stay safe! Flies and I will meet up with you later.\"\nTalviah Aliaria: \"I guess we're really doing this, aren't we?\"\nAt the meeting:\nElder Akarah: \"Trinimac, hear our prayer. Guide our weapons and alert us to all dangers. Grant us the courage to complete the trial you place before us.\"\nTalviah Aliaria: \"That doesn't sound good. I thought we were just spying on a meeting.\"\nElder Akarah: \"You, the chosen of the Vosh Rakh, have shown bravery against the Malacath heretics, even going so far as to invade the temple we love and cherish. But one challenge remains. A challenge to test you, to select the most worthy for our most important mission. Now choose a scroll and select a blessing to help you in your ordeal. Elder Azulg will answer any questions you have. Now, in Trinimac's name, may you find great honor\u2014or an honorable death!\"\nThe final test:\nVosh Rakh Taskmaster: \"Ah, now I see how you completed the Gauntlet so quickly. Your disguise is not needed here. I know who you are. You show great courage to stand before us, but what are you truly willing to sacrifice? Are your intentions as pure as ours? We've donned the false god's armor. Attacked and killed true believers within a sacred temple. All for the sake of the sacred plan. Will you make that same sacrifice? Your final test starts now. Are you here to harm us or to join us? To make the Orsimer stronger than they ever imagined? Show us where your loyalty lies! Spill the blood of your ally in Trinimac's name and display your true devotion!\"\nTalviah Aliaria: \"Hey, my amulet stopped working! And did they just say something about spilling my blood? Oh my! You're not considering following through with this, are you? That's \u2026 that's insane!\"\nVosh Rakh Taskmaster: \"Make your choice.\""}

All of games to date have focused on the continent of Tamriel.\nHistory.\nRecorded Tamrielic history is divided into six distinct eras: the &lt;a href=\"Dawn%20Era\"&gt;Dawn Era&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"Merethic%20Era\"&gt;Merethic Era&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"First%20Era\"&gt;First Era&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"Second%20Era\"&gt;Second Era&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"Third%20Era\"&gt;Third Era&lt;/a&gt;, and the &lt;a href=\"Fourth%20Era\"&gt;Fourth Era&lt;/a&gt;. The Eras are typically marked with by the founding or ending of a dynasty.\nDawn Era.\nThe Dawn Era began with the creation of &lt;a href=\"Mundus\"&gt;Mundus&lt;/a&gt;; it is an era that is known mostly through myth and legend, which are different in different cultures, however most scholars agree on what events led up to the start of recorded history. Time did not exist and when it was created it was not linear, like during a &lt;a href=\"Dragon%20Break\"&gt;Dragon Break&lt;/a&gt;. The &lt;a href=\"Convention\"&gt;Convention&lt;/a&gt; took place at the \"end\" of this era, at the imposition of linear time.\nMerethic Era.\nThe Merethic Era, otherwise known as the Mythic Era, was the era between the start of linear time and recorded history. The &lt;a href=\"Atmorans\"&gt;Atmorans&lt;/a&gt; came to Tamriel from &lt;a href=\"Atmora\"&gt;Atmora&lt;/a&gt;; after they arrived, they began to spread throughout mainland &lt;a href=\"Skyrim\"&gt;Skyrim&lt;/a&gt;. When the &lt;a href=\"Aldmer\"&gt;Aldmer&lt;/a&gt; first arrived in Tamriel it is believed by most that they initially settled in the &lt;a href=\"Summerset%20Isles\"&gt;Summerset Isles&lt;/a&gt;, and then spread eastward into the mainland of Tamriel. As the Aldmer settled Tamriel, they changed culturally in relation to their new environment. The ones who stayed in Summerset Isles became the &lt;a href=\"Altmer\"&gt;Altmer&lt;/a&gt;; those in Valenwood, the &lt;a href=\"Bosmer\"&gt;Bosmer&lt;/a&gt;; those in Skyrim, the &lt;a href=\"Snow%20Elves\"&gt;Snow Elves&lt;/a&gt;; in Morrowind, the &lt;a href=\"Chimer\"&gt;Chimer&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Dwemer\"&gt;Dwemer&lt;/a&gt;; in Cyrodiil, the &lt;a href=\"Ayleid\"&gt;Ayleid&lt;/a&gt;; and in High Rock, a mix between the Aldmer and the &lt;a href=\"Nede\"&gt;Nede&lt;/a&gt;s birthed the &lt;a href=\"Bretons\"&gt;Bretons&lt;/a&gt;.\nIt was a time when all manner of mythological occurrences are said to have taken place. The era was commonly considered to be outside of verifiable history, as humanity did not possess a written language to speak of until the end of the Mythic Era. A variety of merish records, on the other hand, date back to the Merethic Era.\nFirst Era.\nThe First Era began with an expansion of both man and mer peoples, with varying degrees of conflict and accommodation. The &lt;a href=\"Nords\"&gt;Nords&lt;/a&gt; were particularly warlike, conquering not only Skyrim but areas of High Rock and Morrowind as well. The First Empire of the Nords ultimately fell to a combined force of Chimer and Dwemer to found &lt;a href=\"Resdayn\"&gt;Resdayn&lt;/a&gt;, but in time they would turn against each other, resulting in the disappearance of the Dwemer and the ascendancy of the &lt;a href=\"Tribunal\"&gt;Tribunal&lt;/a&gt; in the governance of the province.\nThe apparently cordial relations between &lt;a href=\"Ayleid\"&gt;Ayleid&lt;/a&gt; and men in Cyrodiil ultimately broke down, and &lt;a href=\"Alessia\"&gt;Alessia&lt;/a&gt; led a slave revolt to liberate men in the province, having received a blessing and the &lt;a href=\"Amulet%20of%20Kings\"&gt;Amulet of Kings&lt;/a&gt; from &lt;a href=\"Akatosh\"&gt;Akatosh&lt;/a&gt;, the latter of which was to serve as a symbol of Imperial power for most of Tamriel's history. After a period of relative stability, this &lt;a href=\"First%20Empire\"&gt;empire&lt;/a&gt; eradicated the remaining Ayleids under the direction of the &lt;a href=\"Alessian%20Order\"&gt;Alessian Order&lt;/a&gt;. The order itself fell during the &lt;a href=\"War%20of%20Righteousness\"&gt;War of Righteousness&lt;/a&gt;, which wiped out both the Order and the Empire.\nThe Second Empire was founded in 1E 2703, when &lt;a href=\"Reman%20Cyrodiil\"&gt;Reman Cyrodiil&lt;/a&gt; unified the province to fight off an &lt;a href=\"Akaviri\"&gt;Akaviri&lt;/a&gt; invasion. Victory in this battle brought both the &lt;a href=\"Dragonguard\"&gt;Dragonguard&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Akaviri%20Potentate\"&gt;Akaviri Potentate&lt;/a&gt; to Tamriel. Reman and his descendents then went on to conquer all of Tamriel except Morrowind, founding the &lt;a href=\"Second%20Empire\"&gt;Second Empire&lt;/a&gt;, which some call a golden age. &lt;a href=\"Reman%20II\"&gt;Reman II&lt;/a&gt; began the Four-Score War with Morrowind, which ended the same year &lt;a href=\"Reman%20III\"&gt;Reman III&lt;/a&gt; was assassinated by the &lt;a href=\"Morag%20Tong\"&gt;Morag Tong&lt;/a&gt;,&lt;a href=\"1E%202920\"&gt;1E 2920&lt;/a&gt;. As Reman left no heirs, the Potentate &lt;a href=\"Versidue-Shaie\"&gt;Versidue-Shaie&lt;/a&gt; ruled in his place, and declared the end of the First Era.\nSecond Era.\nThe Second Era started after the &lt;a href=\"Akaviri\"&gt;Akaviri&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Potentate\"&gt;Potentate&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Versidue%20Shaie\"&gt;Versidue Shaie&lt;/a&gt; ordered the assassination of the last of the Reman line in 1E &lt;a href=\"2920\"&gt;2920&lt;/a&gt;. Facing rebellious nobles building up their own sizeable forces, he used his remaining legions to crush all independent armies and instituted what would become the &lt;a href=\"Fighters%20Guild\"&gt;Fighters Guild&lt;/a&gt; as a place to hire mercenaries. He also affirmed the charter to found the &lt;a href=\"Mages%20Guild\"&gt;Mages Guild&lt;/a&gt;, begun by &lt;a href=\"Vanus%20Galerion\"&gt;Vanus Galerion&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Firsthold\"&gt;Firsthold&lt;/a&gt; on the Summerset Isles in 2E 230. Both Shaei and his son were in turn assassinated by the Morag Tong, ending the Second Empire centuries after the death of the last Reman. This began the &lt;a href=\"Interregnum\"&gt;Interregnum&lt;/a&gt;, which lasted for centuries and saw many petty kings attempt to take the throne of &lt;a href=\"Cyrodiil\"&gt;Cyrodiil&lt;/a&gt;, and other provinces become their own network of independent kingdoms and alliances, if they were not already.\nThe kingdom of Elsweyr was created in 2E 309, when the &lt;a href=\"Khajiit\"&gt;Khajiit&lt;/a&gt; kingdoms of &lt;a href=\"Pellitine\"&gt;Pellitine&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Anequina\"&gt;Anequina&lt;/a&gt; reconciled their historical differences and the ruling families married.\nThere was a second invasion from Akavir in 2E 572, landing in Skyrim. It was repelled either by a joint force of &lt;a href=\"Argonians\"&gt;Argonians&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Dunmer\"&gt;Dunmer&lt;/a&gt; and Nords, or by &lt;a href=\"Vivec\"&gt;Vivec&lt;/a&gt; flooding the land.\nIn &lt;a href=\"2E%20578\"&gt;2E 578&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Molag%20Bal\"&gt;Molag Bal&lt;/a&gt; launched an invasion on Tamriel known as the &lt;a href=\"Planemeld\"&gt;Planemeld&lt;/a&gt;, in an attempt to drag Nirn out of Mundus and into his realm of &lt;a href=\"Coldharbour\"&gt;Coldharbour&lt;/a&gt;. Molag Bal was doing this by using devices known as &lt;a href=\"Dark%20Anchors\"&gt;Dark Anchors&lt;/a&gt;, but a hero known as the &lt;a href=\"Vestige\"&gt;Vestige&lt;/a&gt; led an army into Coldharbour and put an end to his scheme. Also in this era was the &lt;a href=\"Three%20Banners%20War\"&gt;Three Banners War&lt;/a&gt; between the &lt;a href=\"Ebonheart%20Pact\"&gt;Ebonheart Pact&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"Daggerfall%20Covenant\"&gt;Daggerfall Covenant&lt;/a&gt;, and the &lt;a href=\"Aldmeri%20Dominion%20%28Online%29\"&gt;First Aldmeri Dominion&lt;/a&gt;, during which the three factions struggled to gain control over Cyrodiil and the rest of Tamriel. The Interregnum ended after &lt;a href=\"Tiber%20Septim\"&gt;Tiber Septim&lt;/a&gt; conquered Tamriel, declaring a new era in 2E 896 to mark the completion of his conquest.\nThird Era.\nThe Third Era was the time of the &lt;a href=\"Septim%20Dynasty\"&gt;Septim Dynasty&lt;/a&gt;. The early years were mostly peaceful, barring the assassination of &lt;a href=\"Pelagius%20I\"&gt;Pelagius I&lt;/a&gt;. The first major upheaval of the era was the &lt;a href=\"War%20of%20the%20Red%20Diamond\"&gt;War of the Red Diamond&lt;/a&gt;, where &lt;a href=\"Potema%20Septim\"&gt;Potema Septim&lt;/a&gt; tried to claim the Ruby Throne for herself and her son &lt;a href=\"Uriel%20Septim%20III\"&gt;Uriel&lt;/a&gt;. This involved parts of Skyrim and Morrowind turning against the Empire, and only ended in 3E 137, after the Empress Kintyra, Uriel Septim III and Potema were all dead.\nThe later years of the Third Era show an increasing level of political instability across Tamriel. The &lt;a href=\"Camoran%20Usurper\"&gt;Camoran Usurper&lt;/a&gt; arose in Valenwood around 3E 253, and conquered Valenwood and Hammerfell with an army of daedra, before being stopped at High Rock in 3E 267. The imprisonment of &lt;a href=\"Uriel%20Septim%20VII\"&gt;Uriel Septim VII&lt;/a&gt; and the time of the &lt;a href=\"Imperial%20Simulacrum\"&gt;Imperial Simulacrum&lt;/a&gt; brought many more small wars across the Empire as Tharn's governance faltered. Ultimately Tharn was defeated by the &lt;a href=\"Eternal%20Champion\"&gt;Eternal Champion&lt;/a&gt;, and Uriel Septim returned to the throne of the Empire. The &lt;a href=\"Iliac%20Bay\"&gt;Iliac Bay&lt;/a&gt; area of High Rock witnessed the reactivation of the Numidium and reorganization of the High Rock political landscape in 3E 417, known as the &lt;a href=\"Warp%20in%20the%20West\"&gt;Warp in the West&lt;/a&gt;.\nA few years later Morrowind was changed by the apparent reincarnation of &lt;a href=\"Indoril%20Nerevar\"&gt;Indoril Nerevar&lt;/a&gt;, and the downfall of the Tribunal. The &lt;a href=\"Oblivion%20Crisis\"&gt;Oblivion Crisis&lt;/a&gt; arose six years later when &lt;a href=\"Mehrunes%20Dagon\"&gt;Mehrunes Dagon&lt;/a&gt;, attempted to invade Nirn. This caused widespread devastation, including the destruction of the &lt;a href=\"Crystal%20Tower\"&gt;Crystal Tower&lt;/a&gt;. At the beginning of this the current emperor, &lt;a href=\"Uriel%20Septim%20VII\"&gt;Uriel Septim VII&lt;/a&gt; was assassinated along with all his heirs, save one illegitimate son, &lt;a href=\"Martin%20Septim\"&gt;Martin Septim&lt;/a&gt;. Ultimately Martin destroyed the Amulet of Kings and sacrificed himself to defeat Dagon, bringing the Septim line of emperors to an end.\nFourth Era.\nIn &lt;a href=\"4E%205\"&gt;4E 5&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Lie%20Rock\"&gt;Lie Rock&lt;/a&gt; fell upon &lt;a href=\"Vivec%20City\"&gt;Vivec City&lt;/a&gt; in Morrowind, causing Red Mountain to erupt. The dual cataclysm caused widespread destruction across the province, reducing many cities to rubble. In the wake of the eruption, the province was invaded by the Argonians, taking revenge for years of systematic enslavement by the Dunmer.\nThe Fourth Era saw the general decline of the Mages Guild, due to magic's reputation of having started the Oblivion Crisis. Many splinter groups were subsequently formed in many provinces, such as the &lt;a href=\"Synod\"&gt;Synod&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"College%20of%20Whispers\"&gt;College of Whispers&lt;/a&gt;.\nIn &lt;a href=\"4E%2022\"&gt;4E 22&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"Thalmor%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Thalmor&lt;/a&gt; resurrected the &lt;a href=\"Third%20Aldmeri%20Dominion\"&gt;Third Aldmeri Dominion&lt;/a&gt; in the Summerset Isles. In &lt;a href=\"4E%2029\"&gt;4E 29&lt;/a&gt;, the Third Aldmeri Dominion invaded &lt;a href=\"Valenwood\"&gt;Valenwood&lt;/a&gt;, overthrew the government and allied themselves with the &lt;a href=\"Bosmer\"&gt;Bosmer&lt;/a&gt; there. In &lt;a href=\"4E%2098\"&gt;4E 98&lt;/a&gt;, the two moons, &lt;a href=\"Masser\"&gt;Masser&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Secunda\"&gt;Secunda&lt;/a&gt;, mysteriously disappeared, an incident known as the &lt;a href=\"Void%20Nights\"&gt;Void Nights&lt;/a&gt;. After two years, the two moons finally returned. The Thalmor immediately announced that they had restored the moons using previously unknown Dawn magicks, so the Khajiit credited the Thalmor as their saviors. The Third Aldmeri Dominion was now composed of the Summerset Isles, Valenwood and Elsweyr.\nIn 4E 171, the Aldmeri Dominion sent their ambassadors to the &lt;a href=\"Imperial%20City\"&gt;Imperial City&lt;/a&gt; with an ultimatum. The list of demands included tributes, disbandment of the Blades, outlawing the worship of Talos and the ceding of large sections of Hammerfell to the Dominion. The Emperor rejected the ultimatum, and the &lt;a href=\"Great%20War\"&gt;Great War&lt;/a&gt; began. After a bloody war fought across Hammerfell and Cyrodiil, the Dominion were defeated at &lt;a href=\"Battle%20of%20the%20Red%20Ring\"&gt;Battle of the Red Ring&lt;/a&gt;. Following this battle, the current Emperor, &lt;a href=\"Titus%20Mede%20II\"&gt;Titus Mede II&lt;/a&gt;, signed the &lt;a href=\"White-Gold%20Concordat\"&gt;White-Gold Concordat&lt;/a&gt; with the Dominion in 4E 175, which was largely similar to the terms initially rejected. Hammerfell, however, continued to fight, and was ultimately renounced by the Empire, and forced the Dominion to withdraw from the province in 4E 180.\nCivil war broke out in Skyrim during the Third Century of the Fourth Era, with conflict worsening following the killing of &lt;a href=\"High%20King\"&gt;High King&lt;/a&gt; of Skyrim &lt;a href=\"Torygg\"&gt;Torygg&lt;/a&gt; by &lt;a href=\"Ulfric%20Stormcloak\"&gt;Ulfric Stormcloak&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href=\"Alduin\"&gt;Alduin&lt;/a&gt;, Nordic God of Destruction and Firstborn of &lt;a href=\"Akatosh\"&gt;Akatosh&lt;/a&gt;, also returned, bringing with him the reappearance of the &lt;a href=\"Dragons%20%28Lore%29\"&gt;dragons&lt;/a&gt; to Skyrim. However, the &lt;a href=\"Last%20Dragonborn\"&gt;Dragonborn&lt;/a&gt; ultimately defeated Alduin, averting Tamriel's destruction.\nGeography.\nTamriel is typically divided into nine provinces, outlined below. These have fluctuated throughout Tamriel's history, but these are the most usual form of reference.\nProvinces of the Fourth Era.\nIn the 200 years before , the Empire had lost much of its territory. By 4E 22, The Summerset Isles belonged to the &lt;a href=\"Thalmor\"&gt;Thalmor&lt;/a&gt; faction. By 4E 115, the &lt;a href=\"Third%20Aldmeri%20Dominion\"&gt;Third Aldmeri Dominion&lt;/a&gt; had been formed, comprising the Summerset Isles (now renamed \"Alinor\") and Valenwood, which had been seized by Thalmor sympathizers during a coup. Around 4E 5\u20136, &lt;a href=\"Red%20Mountain\"&gt;Red Mountain&lt;/a&gt; erupted in Vvardenfell, destroying the island and much of northern Morrowind. With Morrowind severely weakened, the Argonians (who had seceded from the Empire) invaded, conquering the Dunmer. Also, due to the Great War and the &lt;a href=\"White-Gold%20Concordat\"&gt;White-Gold Concordat&lt;/a&gt; that followed, Hammerfell was ejected from the Empire and now belongs to neither it or the Dominion. As of 4E 201, Skyrim is in a state of civil war and, while nominally still part of the Empire, its future status is uncertain.\nBelow are a list of all provinces and their affiliation:\nGovernments.\nThird Empire.\nSince the &lt;a href=\"Second%20Era\"&gt;Second Era&lt;/a&gt;, the Tamriel had been governed by the &lt;a href=\"Third%20Empire\"&gt;Third Empire&lt;/a&gt; that, until the &lt;a href=\"Oblivion%20Crisis\"&gt;Oblivion Crisis&lt;/a&gt;, was led by an Emperor of the &lt;a href=\"Septim%20Dynasty\"&gt;Septim Dynasty&lt;/a&gt;. The center of the Empire was Cyrodiil, which was the home of both the Emperor of Tamriel and the &lt;a href=\"Elder%20Council\"&gt;Elder Council&lt;/a&gt;, which serves administrative functions and as an interim government during times of instability. Upon the death of the Emperor, the new Emperor is usually the oldest legitimate child (preferably a son) of the dead Emperor. However, spouses, younger children, siblings and on at least one occasion, an illegitimate child have taken the throne.\nAfter the death of the last of the Septim Emperor, the head of the Elder Council and \"de facto\" head of state was &lt;a href=\"Ocato\"&gt;Imperial High Chancellor, Grand Battle-Mage Ocato&lt;/a&gt;.\nFollowing the &lt;a href=\"Stormcrown%20Interregnum\"&gt;Stormcrown Interregnum&lt;/a&gt; at the beginning of the Fourth Era, the &lt;a href=\"Imperial\"&gt;Imperial&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Mede%20Dynasty\"&gt;Mede Dynasty&lt;/a&gt; is the ruling family of the Third Empire and retained the Elder Council.\nEach province has its own form of government which sees to the affairs of that province. This can vary between being kingdoms, councils or provincial governors, depending on the province in question. There may also be a degree of direct Imperial administration in some places, with an Imperial bureaucracy in place, but the degree to which this is commonplace is unclear.\nAldmeri Dominion.\nThe Aldmeri Dominion, known also as the Third Aldmeri Dominion, is a powerful union that has repeatedly occurred between the Altmer of Summerset Isles, the Bosmer of Valenwood, and the Khajiit of the &lt;a href=\"Elsweyr%20Confederacy\"&gt;Elsweyr Confederacy&lt;/a&gt; (or the kingdoms of &lt;a href=\"Anequina\"&gt;Anequina&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Pelletine\"&gt;Pelletine&lt;/a&gt;). The Dominion of the &lt;a href=\"Second%20Era\"&gt;Second Era&lt;/a&gt; was the most stable power in Tamriel until the coming of Tiber Septim, and at the end of the &lt;a href=\"Interregnum\"&gt;Interregnum&lt;/a&gt;, Tamriel was divided between the Empire and the Dominion.\nThe Dominion's ruling body, the &lt;a href=\"Thalmor\"&gt;Thalmor&lt;/a&gt;, is a congress of Bosmeri chieftains and Altmeri diplomats, and its armies were responsible for repelling the Colovian invasions of Valenwood, and Thalmor Justiciars also helped to remove every &lt;a href=\"Blades\"&gt;Blades&lt;/a&gt; spy in Summerset and Valenwood. At the end of the Second Era, the King of &lt;a href=\"Alinor\"&gt;Alinor&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Imperial%20Battlemage\"&gt;Imperial Battlemage&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Zurin%20Arctus\"&gt;Zurin Arctus&lt;/a&gt;, were to strike a peace treaty between the Empire and the Dominion. However, Tiber Septim instead decided to use the Brass God, Numidium, to conquer the Summerset Isles, an event that is still remembered by many living Altmer with horror. In the early &lt;a href=\"Fourth%20Era\"&gt;Fourth Era&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"Aldmeri%20Dominion%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Aldmeri Dominion&lt;/a&gt; was re-established after over four hundred years.\nAn-Xileel.\nThe An-Xileel is a political faction that rules over the &lt;a href=\"Black%20Marsh\"&gt;Black Marsh&lt;/a&gt; which rose during the &lt;a href=\"Oblivion%20Crisis\"&gt;Oblivion Crisis&lt;/a&gt;. And were largely responsible for it departing the &lt;a href=\"Third%20Empire\"&gt;Empire of Tamriel&lt;/a&gt; and for the &lt;a href=\"Argonian%20Invasion\"&gt;Argonian Invasion&lt;/a&gt;, and subsequent occupation, of southern &lt;a href=\"Morrowind\"&gt;Morrowind&lt;/a&gt;. They stopped their advance in Morrowind decades ago after being driven back by House Redoran, and haven\u2019t showed the slightest interest in doing anything since then. They have, however, prevented the Empire from reclaiming their territory.\nGreat Houses.\nThere are five organizations of &lt;a href=\"Dunmer\"&gt;Dunmer&lt;/a&gt; in the region of &lt;a href=\"Morrowind\"&gt;Morrowind&lt;/a&gt; that are known as Great Houses. They have their origins in ancient &lt;a href=\"Velothi\"&gt;Velothi&lt;/a&gt; tribes, and function effectively as political parties within the Morrowind polity, as well as controlling much of the trade and local administration in the province.\nRepresentatives from each of the Great Houses form the &lt;a href=\"Grand%20Council\"&gt;Grand Council&lt;/a&gt;, the body that has ruled Morrowind since the late &lt;a href=\"First%20Era\"&gt;First Era&lt;/a&gt;. The Houses themselves also have ruling councils, which enforce House policy and conduct.\nCulture.\nReligion.\nMany different gods are worshipped across Tamriel, with each culture having its own pantheon of gods. A complete list of these can be found in the book &lt;a href=\"Varieties%20of%20Faith%20in%20the%20Empire\"&gt;Varieties of Faith in the Empire&lt;/a&gt;. However, many of these pantheons represent the same deities, which can broadly be split into two groups:\nNote that even where the pantheons appear to venerate the same deities, there is some variance in how they are worshipped and which other deities are worshipped. Each culture has a different interpretation of the gods and their actions, which impacts their beliefs.\nDemographics.\nThe main races of Tamriel are the &lt;a href=\"Bretons\"&gt;Bretons&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Redguards\"&gt;Redguards&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Imperials\"&gt;Imperials&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Argonians\"&gt;Argonians&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Khajiit\"&gt;Khajiit&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Altmer\"&gt;Altmer&lt;/a&gt; (High Elves), &lt;a href=\"Dunmer\"&gt;Dunmer&lt;/a&gt; (Dark Elves), &lt;a href=\"Bosmer\"&gt;Bosmer&lt;/a&gt; (Wood Elves), &lt;a href=\"Orsimer\"&gt;Orsimer&lt;/a&gt; (Orcs), and &lt;a href=\"Nords\"&gt;Nords&lt;/a&gt;.\nOther races in Tamriel include the following:\nOther continents.\nAlthough Tamriel is the most well-known and important place in the world, it is not the only one. Far to the north of Tamriel lies Atmora, from which the Atmorans came to conquer Tamriel. Atmora, in the Elvish language, means \"Elder Wood.\"\nTo the west of Tamriel lies the sunken continent of &lt;a href=\"Yokuda\"&gt;Yokuda&lt;/a&gt;, from which the people that are now called the Redguards came to take over Hammerfell, in the year 808 of the First Era. The people who became the modern-day Redguards came to Tamriel because the region was largely rendered uninhabitable, but the cause of its sinking is debated.\nTo the east of Tamriel lies the continent of &lt;a href=\"Akavir\"&gt;Akavir&lt;/a&gt;, which means \"Dragon Land.\" Akavir is home to four major groups: &lt;a href=\"Kamal\"&gt;Kamal&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Tsaesci\"&gt;Tsaesci&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Tang%20Mo\"&gt;Tang Mo&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Ka%20Po%27%20Tun\"&gt;Ka Po' Tun&lt;/a&gt;. It was once home to the &lt;a href=\"Akaviri\"&gt;Akaviri&lt;/a&gt;, a race of Man and, most notably, the &lt;a href=\"Dragons%20%28Lore%29\"&gt;dragons&lt;/a&gt;, but the Tsaesci may have driven the dragons and men to extinction, and it is unknown what happened to the Akaviri. Before the Akaviri allegedly became extinct, they had launched multiple invasions on Tamriel in the past.\nBelow Summerset Isles, just to the south of Tamriel, lies &lt;a href=\"Pyandonea\"&gt;Pyandonea&lt;/a&gt;, the tropical home of the &lt;a href=\"Maormer\"&gt;Maormer&lt;/a&gt; or Tropical Elves.\nThe Coral Kingdoms of &lt;a href=\"Thras\"&gt;Thras&lt;/a&gt;, an archipelago southwest of Tamriel, is the homeland of the &lt;a href=\"Sload\"&gt;Sload&lt;/a&gt;, a conservative amphibious sluglike race. The &lt;a href=\"Thrassian%20Plague\"&gt;Thrassian Plague&lt;/a&gt; devastated Tamriel around &lt;a href=\"1E%202200\"&gt;1E 2200&lt;/a&gt;, after which a united Tamrielic navy ravaged and sank Thras into the sea. It has since recovered."}

The legendary ranger, Raerlas Ghile, was granted the Bow for a secret mission that failed, and the Bow was lost. Raerlas did not go down without a hearty fight and is said to have, with the aid of the Bow, taken scores of his foes with him. The Bow grants the user the ability of invisibility and increased speed. Many sightings of the Bow of Shadows have been reported, and it is even said that the sinister &lt;a href=\"Dunmer\"&gt;Dark Elf&lt;/a&gt; assassin of the &lt;a href=\"Second%20Era\"&gt;Second Era&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Dram\"&gt;Dram&lt;/a&gt;, once wielded this bow.\n&lt;a href=\"Chrysamere\"&gt;Chrysamere&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe Paladin's Blade is an ancient claymore with offensive capabilities surpassed only by its own defenses. It lends the wielder health, protects him or her from fire, and reflects any spells cast against the wielder back to the caster. Seldom has Chrysamere been wielded by any bladesman for any length of time, for it chooses not to favor one champion.\n&lt;a href=\"Savior%27s%20Hide\"&gt;Cuirass of the Savior's Hide&lt;/a&gt;.\nAnother of &lt;a href=\"Hircine\"&gt;Hircine&lt;/a&gt;'s artifacts was the Cuirass of the Savior's Hide. The Cuirass has the special ability to resist magicka. Legend has it that Hircine awarded his peeled hide to the first and only mortal to have ever escaped his hunting grounds. This unknown mortal had the hide tailored into this magical Cuirass for his future adventures. The Savior's Hide has a tendency to travel from hero to hero as though it has a mind of its own.\n&lt;a href=\"Daedric%20Scourge\"&gt;Daedric Scourge&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Daedra\"&gt;Daedric&lt;/a&gt; Scourge is a mighty mace forged from sacred ebony in the Fires of Fickledire. The legendary weapon of &lt;a href=\"Mackkan\"&gt;Mackkan&lt;/a&gt;, it was once a fierce weapon used to send spirits of darkness back into &lt;a href=\"Oblivion%20%28Realm%29\"&gt;Oblivion&lt;/a&gt;. The weapon has the ability to summon creatures from Oblivion.\n&lt;a href=\"Denstagmer%27s%20Ring\"&gt;Denstagmer's Ring&lt;/a&gt;.\nAll that is known of this Ring is that it may grant the user protection from certain elements. Even the name Denstagmer is a mystery.\n&lt;a href=\"Ebony%20Mail\"&gt;Ebony Mail&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe Ebony Mail is a breastplate created before recorded history by the Dark Elven goddess &lt;a href=\"Boethiah\"&gt;Boethiah&lt;/a&gt;. It is she who determines who should possess the Ebony Mail and for how long a time. If judged worthy, its power grants the wearer added resistance of fire, magicka, and grants a magical shield. It is Boethiah alone who determines when a person is ineligible to bear the Ebony Mail any longer, and the goddess can be very capricious.\n&lt;a href=\"Eleidon%27s%20Ward\"&gt;Eleidon's Ward&lt;/a&gt;.\nEleidon was a holy knight of legend in &lt;a href=\"Bretons\"&gt;Breton&lt;/a&gt; history. He was a sought after man for his courage and determination to set all wrongs right. In one story, it is said that he rescued a Baron's daughter from sure death at the hands of an evil warlord. For his reward, the Baron spent all of his riches to have an enchanted shield built for Eleidon. The Shield granted Eleidon the opportunity to heal his wounds.\n&lt;a href=\"Fang%20of%20Haynekhtnamet\"&gt;Fang of Haynekhtnamet&lt;/a&gt;.\n&lt;a href=\"Black%20Marsh%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Black Marsh&lt;/a&gt; was once known to be inhabited with what the &lt;a href=\"Argonians\"&gt;Argonians&lt;/a&gt; called the &lt;a href=\"Wamasu%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Wamasus&lt;/a&gt;. Northern men considered them to be intelligent dragons with lightning for blood. One such mighty beast, &lt;a href=\"Haynekhtnamet\"&gt;Haynekhtnamet&lt;/a&gt;, was slain by the Northern men, though it took seven days and nights, and a score of men. One of the surviving men took a fang home as a trophy. The fang was carved down into a blade and fashioned into a small dagger. The dagger mysteriously houses some of the beast's magical properties and grants the user the ability to do shock damage on an opponent. This unique dagger is seen occasionally by traveling heroes.\n&lt;a href=\"Fists%20of%20Randagulf\"&gt;Fists of Randagulf&lt;/a&gt;.\n&lt;a href=\"Randagulf\"&gt;Randagulf&lt;/a&gt; of Clan Begalin goes down in Tamrielic history as one of the mightiest warriors from &lt;a href=\"Skyrim\"&gt;Skyrim&lt;/a&gt;. He was known for his courage and ferocity in battle and was a factor in many battles. He finally met his fate when King Harald conquered Skyrim. King &lt;a href=\"Harald\"&gt;Harald&lt;/a&gt; respected this great hero and took Randagulf's gauntlets for his own. After King Harald died, the gauntlets disappeared. The King claimed that the Fists granted the bearer added strength.\n&lt;a href=\"Goldbrand\"&gt;Goldbrand&lt;/a&gt;.\nThis magical Sword is almost a complete mystery. Thieves tell tales about its golden make and how it was actually forged by ancient dragons of the North. Their tales claim that it was given to a great knight who was sworn to protect the &lt;a href=\"Dragons%20%28Lore%29\"&gt;dragons&lt;/a&gt;. The Sword lends its wielder the ability to do fire damage on an enemy. Goldbrand has not been sighted in recent history and is said to be awaiting a worthy hero.\n&lt;a href=\"Helm%20of%20Oreyn%20Bearclaw\"&gt;Helm of Oreyn Bearclaw&lt;/a&gt;.\nOne of &lt;a href=\"Valenwood\"&gt;Valenwood's&lt;/a&gt; legendary heroes is &lt;a href=\"Oreyn%20Bearclaw\"&gt;Oreyn Bearclaw&lt;/a&gt;. Son of King &lt;a href=\"Faume%20Toad-Eye\"&gt;Faume Toad-Eye&lt;/a&gt;, he was a respected clan hunter and a future leader. Wood Elven legend claims Oreyn single handedly defeated &lt;a href=\"Glenhwyfaunva\"&gt;Glenhwyfaunva&lt;/a&gt;, the witch-serpent of the Elven wood, forever bringing peace to his clan. Oreyn would go on to accomplish numerous other deeds, eventually losing his life to the &lt;a href=\"Knahaten%20Flu\"&gt;Knahaten Flu&lt;/a&gt;. His Helm stood as a monument of his stature for future generations to remember. The Helm was lost eventually, as the Clan split, and is now a treasured artifact for adventurers. The Helm of Oreyn Bearclaw is rumored to improve the wearer's agility and endurance."}

All have been seen, owned, and lost, again and again throughout &lt;a href=\"Tamriel\"&gt;Tamriel&lt;/a&gt;. Some may be myth, others may be hoax, but regardless, many have lost their lives attempting to find or protect these very coveted items.\n&lt;a href=\"Ice%20Blade%20of%20the%20Monarch%20%28Weapon%29\"&gt;Ice Blade of the Monarch&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe Ice Blade of the Monarch is truly one of Tamriel's most prized artifacts. Legend has it that the Evil &lt;a href=\"Archmage\"&gt;Archmage&lt;/a&gt; Almion Celmo enchanted the claymore of a great warrior with the soul of a &lt;a href=\"Frost%20Monarch\"&gt;Frost Monarch&lt;/a&gt;, a stronger form of the more common &lt;a href=\"Frost%20Atronach\"&gt;Frost Atronach&lt;/a&gt;. The warrior, Thurgnarr Assi, was to play a part in the assassination of a great king in a far off land, and become the new leader. The assassination failed and the Archmage was imprisoned. The Ice Blade freezes all who feel its blade. The Blade circulates from owner to owner, never settling in one place for long.\n&lt;a href=\"Lord%27s%20Mail\"&gt;Lord's Mail&lt;/a&gt;.\nSometimes called the Armor of &lt;a href=\"Morihaus\"&gt;Morihaus&lt;/a&gt; or the gift of &lt;a href=\"Kynareth\"&gt;Kynareth&lt;/a&gt;, this is an ancient cuirass of unsurpassable quality. It grants the wearer power to absorb health, resist the effects of spells, and cure oneself of poison when used. It is said that whenever Kynareth deigns the wearer unworthy, the Lord's Mail will be taken away and hidden for the next chosen one.\n&lt;a href=\"Mace%20of%20Molag%20Bal\"&gt;Mace of Molag Bal&lt;/a&gt;.\nAlso known as the Vampire's Mace, the Mace of Molag Bal drains its victims of magicka and gives it to the bearer. It also has the ability to transfer an enemy's strength to its wielder. &lt;a href=\"Molag%20Bal\"&gt;Molag Bal&lt;/a&gt; has been quite free with his artifact. There are many legends about the Mace. It seems to be a favorite for vanquishing wizards.\n&lt;a href=\"Clavicus%20Vile%27s%20Masque\"&gt;Masque of Clavicus Vile&lt;/a&gt;.\nEver the vain one, &lt;a href=\"Clavicus%20Vile\"&gt;Clavicus Vile&lt;/a&gt; made a masque suited to his own personality. The bearer of the Masque is more likely to get a positive response from the people of Tamriel. The higher his personality, the larger the bonus. The best known story of the Masque tells the tale of &lt;a href=\"Avalea\"&gt;Avalea&lt;/a&gt;, a noblewoman of some renown. As a young girl, she was grossly disfigured by a spiteful servant. Avalea made a dark deal with Clavicus Vile and received the Masque in return. Though the Masque did not change her looks, suddenly she had the respect and admiration of everyone. A year and a day after her marriage to a well-connected baron, Clavicus Vile reclaimed the Masque. Although pregnant with his child, Avalea was banished from the Baron's household. Twenty-one years and one day later, Avalea's daughter claimed her vengeance by slaying the Baron.\n&lt;a href=\"Mehrunes%27%20Razor\"&gt;Mehrunes' Razor&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Dark%20Brotherhood\"&gt;Dark Brotherhood&lt;/a&gt; has coveted this ebony dagger for generations. This mythical artifact is capable of slaying any creature instantly. History does not record any bearers of &lt;a href=\"Mehrunes%20Dagon\"&gt;Mehrunes'&lt;/a&gt; Razor. However, the Dark Brotherhood was once decimated by a vicious internal power struggle. It is suspected that the Razor was involved.\n&lt;a href=\"Mentor%27s%20Ring\"&gt;The Mentor's Ring&lt;/a&gt;.\nThis simple metal band is a prized possession for any apprentice to magic. It lends the wearer the ability to increase their &lt;a href=\"intelligence\"&gt;intelligence&lt;/a&gt; and wisdom, thus making their use of magic more efficient. The High Wizard Carni Asron is said to be the creator of the Ring. It was a construct for his young apprentices while studying under his guidance. After Asron's death, the Ring and several other possessions vanished and have since circulated throughout Tamriel.\n&lt;a href=\"Ring%20of%20Khajiit\"&gt;Ring of Khajiit&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe Ring of the Khajiit is an ancient relic, hundreds of years older than &lt;a href=\"Rajhin\"&gt;Rajhin&lt;/a&gt;, the thief that made the Ring famous. It was Rajhin who used the Ring's powers to make himself invisible and as quick as the breath of wind. Using the Ring, he became the most successful burglar in &lt;a href=\"Elsweyr\"&gt;Elsweyr&lt;/a&gt;'s history. Rajhin's eventual fate is a mystery, but according to legend, the Ring rebelled against such constant use and disappeared, leaving Rajhin helpless before his enemies.\n&lt;a href=\"Ring%20of%20Phynaster\"&gt;Ring of Phynaster&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe Ring of Phynaster was made hundreds of years ago by a man who needed good defenses to survive his adventurous life. Thanks to the Ring, &lt;a href=\"Phynaster\"&gt;Phynaster&lt;/a&gt; lived for hundreds of years, and since then it has passed from person to person. The Ring improves its wearer's overall resistance to poison, magicka, and shock. Still, Phynaster was cunning and cursed the Ring so that it eventually disappears from its holder's possessions and returns to another resting place, discontented to stay anywhere but with Phynaster himself.\n&lt;a href=\"Ring%20of%20Surroundings\"&gt;Ring of Surroundings&lt;/a&gt;.\nLittle is known of this prize but it is said that it lends the wearer the ability to blend in with their surroundings.\n&lt;a href=\"Ring%20of%20the%20Wind\"&gt;Ring of the Wind&lt;/a&gt;.\nNo facts are known about this Ring, but the title and the few rumors lend one to think it grants the wearer added speed."}

Some may be myth, others may be hoax, but regardless, many have lost their lives attempting to find or protect these very coveted items.\n&lt;a href=\"Skull%20Crusher%20%28Morrowind%20Weapon%29\"&gt;Skull Crusher&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe Skull Crusher is an amazingly large and powerful weapon. This warhammer was created in a fire, magically fueled by the Wizard, Dorach Gusal, and was forged by the great weaponsmith, Hilbongard Rolamus. The steel is magically hardened and the weight of the weapon is amazingly light, which makes for more powerful swings and deadly blows. The warhammer was to be put on display for a festival, but thieves got it first. The Skull Crusher still travels Tamriel in search of its creators.\n&lt;a href=\"Spear%20of%20Bitter%20Mercy\"&gt;Spear of Bitter Mercy&lt;/a&gt;.\nOne of the more mysterious artifacts is the Spear of Bitter Mercy. Little to nothing is known about the Spear. There are no recorded histories but many believe it to be of &lt;a href=\"Daedric\"&gt;Daedric&lt;/a&gt; origin.\n&lt;a href=\"Spell%20Breaker\"&gt;Spell Breaker&lt;/a&gt;.\nSpell Breaker, superficially a &lt;a href=\"Dwemer\"&gt;Dwemer&lt;/a&gt; tower shield, is one of the most ancient relics of Tamriel. Aside from its historical importance in the &lt;a href=\"Battle%20of%20Rourken-Shalidor\"&gt;Battle of Rourken-Shalidor&lt;/a&gt;, the Spell Breaker protects its wielder almost completely from any spell caster, either by reflecting magics or silencing any mage about to cast a spell. It is said that Spell Breaker still searches for its original owner, and will not remain the property of anyone else for long. For most, possessing Spell Breaker for any length of time is power enough.\n&lt;a href=\"Staff%20of%20Hasedoki\"&gt;Staff of Hasedoki&lt;/a&gt;.\n&lt;a href=\"Hasedoki\"&gt;Hasedoki&lt;/a&gt; was said to have been a very competitive wizard. He wandered the land in search for a wizard who was greater than he. To the best of all knowledge, he never found a wizard who could meet up to his challenge. It is said that he felt so lonely and isolated because so many feared his power, that he bonded his life-force into his very own staff, where his soul remains to this very day. Magic users all over Tamriel have been searching for this magical staff. Granting its wielder a protection of magicka, it is a sure prize for any magic user.\n&lt;a href=\"Staff%20of%20Magnus\"&gt;Staff of Magnus&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe Staff of Magnus, one of the elder artifacts of Tamriel, was a metaphysical battery of sorts for its creator, &lt;a href=\"Magnus\"&gt;Magnus&lt;/a&gt;. When used, it absorbs an enemy's health and mystical energy. In time, the Staff will abandon the mage who wields it before he becomes too powerful and upsets the mystical balance it is sworn to protect.\n&lt;a href=\"Umbra%20Sword\"&gt;Umbra Sword&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe Umbra Sword was enchanted by the ancient witch &lt;a href=\"Naenra%20Waerr\"&gt;Naenra Waerr&lt;/a&gt;, and its sole purpose was the entrapment of souls. Used in conjunction with a soul gem, the Sword allows the wielder the opportunity to imprison an enemy's soul in the gem. Naenra was executed for her evil creation, but not before she was able to hide the Sword. The Umbra Sword is very choosy when it comes to owners and therefore remains hidden until a worthy one is found.\n&lt;a href=\"Vampiric%20Ring\"&gt;Vampiric Ring&lt;/a&gt;.\nOne of the more deadly and rare artifacts in Tamriel is the Vampiric Ring. It is said that the Ring has the power to steal its victim's health and grant it to the wearer. The exact nature and origin of the Ring is wholly unknown, but many elders speak of its evil creation in &lt;a href=\"Morrowind\"&gt;Morrowind&lt;/a&gt; long, long ago by a cult of &lt;a href=\"Vampire\"&gt;Vampire&lt;/a&gt; followers. The Vampiric Ring is an extremely rare artifact and is only seen every few hundred cycles of the moons.\n&lt;a href=\"Warlock%27s%20Ring%20%28Item%29\"&gt;Warlock's Ring&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe Warlock's Ring of the &lt;a href=\"Arch-Mage\"&gt;Archmage&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Syrabane\"&gt;Syrabane&lt;/a&gt; is one of the most popular relics of myth and fable. In Tamriel's ancient history, Syrabane saved all of the continent by judicious use of his Ring, and ever since, it has helped adventurers with less lofty goals. It is best known for its ability to reflect spells cast at its wearer and to improve his or her speed and to restore health. No adventurer can wear the Warlock's Ring for long, for it is said that the Ring is Syrabane's alone to command."}

A controlled environment can allow the artist to communicate precisely through color and form, and reach beyond the page to the reader. It's easy to forget that external factors, such as the weather or the temperature, can significantly alter a calligrapher's needs.\nFor example, in the heat and humidity of deep Valenwood the popular Delicate Midnight ink\u2014that mainstay of proper Alinor calligraphy\u2014simply will not dry. Turn the paper sideways and the ink runs right off the page. Unthinkable in the temperate Alinor climate, but constant in a place a mere ship's voyage away. Instead, the locals use an ink that can dry even while submerged in water. Foolishness for a scribe at a comfortable writing-desk, but of vital importance for a scout writing an urgent missive in a tropical rainstorm.\nOne other notable evolution of Valenwood inks is the prevalence of ink that glows faintly in darkness. In a well-lit city such as Alinor the need for such things would be minimal. In the deep darkness of the forest, without even moonlight to read by, a faintly glowing ink allows those with proper vision to review critical documents.\nA final point of interest: the common use of inks that work equally well on a variety of surfaces. Quality parchment is rare, and even paper can be uncommon depending on the beliefs of the local &lt;a href=\"Bosmer%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Bosmer&lt;/a&gt;. Writing a missive on a fallen leaf or a flat stone would be unthinkable in Alinor. It's commonplace and often preferred in the depths of the forest. The previously mentioned Delicate Midnight ink is highly valued despite being worthless on paper. When scribed onto a certain kind of porous stone, it will hold its form until vigorously shaken off.\nStone and ink can thus be reused for quite some time. Because the ink does not dry properly, the written word can sometimes last upwards of several months. A common Alinor ink is thus an incredibly valuable rarity among the Bosmer, whose different environment causes them to discover properties of our inks that are likely unknown even to master &lt;a href=\"Altmer%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Altmeri&lt;/a&gt; scribes.\nI intend to continue my study of inks on the &lt;a href=\"Tamriel\"&gt;Tamriel&lt;/a&gt;ic mainland, and will continue providing chapters of this series to the scribes in Alinor."}

Rajhin's eventual fate is a mystery, but according to legend, the Ring rebelled against such constant use and disappeared, leaving Rajhin helpless before his enemies.\n&lt;a href=\"Mace%20of%20Molag%20Bal\"&gt;Mace of Molag Bal&lt;/a&gt;\nAlso known as the Vampire's Mace, the Mace of Molag Bal drains its victims of magicka and gives it to the bearer. It also has the ability to transfer an enemy's strength to its wielder. &lt;a href=\"Molag%20Bal\"&gt;Molag Bal&lt;/a&gt; has been quite free with his artifact. There are many legends about the Mace. It seems to be a favorite for vanquishing wizards.\n&lt;a href=\"Masque%20of%20Clavicus%20Vile\"&gt;Masque of Clavicus Vile&lt;/a&gt;\nEver the vain one, &lt;a href=\"Clavicus%20Vile\"&gt;Clavicus Vile&lt;/a&gt; made a masque suited to his own personality. The bearer of the Masque is more likely to get a positive response from the people of Tamriel. The higher his &lt;a href=\"Personality\"&gt;Personality&lt;/a&gt;, the larger the bonus. The best known story of the Masque tells the tale of &lt;a href=\"Avalea\"&gt;Avalea&lt;/a&gt;, a noblewoman of some renown. As a young girl, she was grossly disfigured by a spiteful servant. Avalea made a dark deal with Clavicus Vile and received the Masque in return. Though the Masque did not change her looks, suddenly she had the respect and admiration of everyone. A year and a day after her marriage to a well connected baron, Clavicus Vile reclaimed the Masque. Although pregnant with his child, Avalea was banished from the Baron's household. Twenty one years and one day later, Avalea's daughter claimed her vengeance by slaying the Baron.\n&lt;a href=\"Mehrunes%20Razor\"&gt;Mehrunes Razor&lt;/a&gt;\nThe &lt;a href=\"Dark%20Brotherhood\"&gt;Dark Brotherhood&lt;/a&gt; has coveted this ebony dagger for generations. This mythical artifact is capable of slaying any creature instantly. History does not record any bearers of &lt;a href=\"Mehrunes%20Dagon\"&gt;Mehrune's&lt;/a&gt; Razor. However, the Dark Brotherhood was once decimated by a vicious internal power struggle. It is suspected that the Razor was involved.\n&lt;a href=\"Savior%27s%20Hide\"&gt;Cuirass of the Saviour's Hide&lt;/a&gt;\nAnother of &lt;a href=\"Hircine\"&gt;Hircine&lt;/a&gt;'s artifacts was the Cuirass of the Savior's Hide. The Cuirass has the special ability to resist magicka. Legend has it that Hircine rewarded his peeled hide to the first and only mortal to have ever escaped his hunting grounds. This unknown mortal had the hide tailored into this magical Cuirass for his future adventures. The Savior's Hide has a tendency to travel from hero to hero as though it has a mind of its own.\n&lt;a href=\"Spear%20of%20Bitter%20Mercy\"&gt;Spear of Bitter Mercy&lt;/a&gt;\nOne of the more mysterious artifacts is the Spear of Bitter Mercy. Little to nothing is known about the Spear. There are no recorded histories but many believe it to be of Daedric origin. The only known legend about it is its use by a mighty hero during the fall of the &lt;a href=\"Battlespire\"&gt;Battlespire&lt;/a&gt;. The hero was aided by the Spear in the defeat of &lt;a href=\"Mehrunes%20Dagon\"&gt;Mehrunes Dagon&lt;/a&gt; and the recapturing of the Battlespire. Since that time, the Spear of Bitter Mercy has made few appearances within Tamriel.\n&lt;a href=\"Daedric%20Scourge\"&gt;Daedric Scourge&lt;/a&gt;\nThe Daedric Scourge is a mighty mace forged from sacred ebony in the Fires of &lt;a href=\"Fickledire\"&gt;Fickledire&lt;/a&gt;. The legendary weapon of &lt;a href=\"Mackkan\"&gt;Mackkan&lt;/a&gt;, it was once a fierce weapon used to send spirits of black back into &lt;a href=\"Oblivion%20%28Realm%29\"&gt;Oblivion&lt;/a&gt;. The weapon has the ability to summon creatures from Oblivion. Once a tool used against the Daedric Lords in the Battlespire, it now roams the land with adventurers.\n&lt;a href=\"Bow%20of%20Shadows\"&gt;Bow of Shadows&lt;/a&gt;\nLegend has it that the Bow of Shadows was forged by the Daedra &lt;a href=\"Nocturnal\"&gt;Nocturnal&lt;/a&gt;. The legendary ranger, &lt;a href=\"Raerlas%20Ghile\"&gt;Raerlas Ghile&lt;/a&gt;, was granted the Bow for a secret mission that failed, and the Bow was lost. Raerlas did not go down without a hearty fight and is said to have, with the aid of the Bow, taken scores of his foes with him. The Bow grants the user the ability of invisibility and increased speed. Many sightings of the Bow of Shadows have been reported, and it is even said that the sinister Dark Elf assassin of the &lt;a href=\"Second%20Era\"&gt;Second Era&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Dram\"&gt;Dram&lt;/a&gt;, once wielded this bow.\n&lt;a href=\"Fists%20of%20Randagulf\"&gt;Fists of Randagulf&lt;/a&gt;\n&lt;a href=\"Randagulf\"&gt;Randagulf&lt;/a&gt; of Clan Begalin goes down in Tamrielic history as one of the mightiest warriors from &lt;a href=\"Skyrim\"&gt;Skyrim&lt;/a&gt;. He was known for his courage and ferocity in battle and was a factor in many battles. He finally met his fate when King &lt;a href=\"Harald\"&gt;Harald&lt;/a&gt; conquered &lt;a href=\"Skyrim\"&gt;Skyrim&lt;/a&gt;. King Harald respected this great hero and took Randagulf's gauntlets for his own. After King Harald died, the gauntlets disappeared. The King claimed that the Fists granted the bearer added strength.\n&lt;a href=\"Ice%20Blade%20of%20the%20Monarch%20%28Weapon%29\"&gt;Ice Blade of the Monarch&lt;/a&gt;\nThe Ice Blade of the Monarch is truly one of Tamriel's most prized artifacts. Legend has it that the Evil &lt;a href=\"Archmage\"&gt;Archmage&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Almion%20Celmo\"&gt;Almion Celmo&lt;/a&gt; enchanted the claymore of a great warrior with the soul of a Frost Monarch, a stronger form of the more common Frost Atronach. The warrior, &lt;a href=\"Thurgnarr%20Assi\"&gt;Thurgnarr Assi&lt;/a&gt;, was to play a part in the assassination of a great king in a far off land, and become the new leader. The assassination failed and the Archmage was imprisoned. The Ice Blade freezes all who feel its blade. The Blade circulates from owner to owner, never settling in one place for long.\n&lt;a href=\"Ring%20of%20Surroundings\"&gt;Ring of Surroundings&lt;/a&gt;\nLittle is known of this prize but it is said that it lends the wearer the ability to blend in with their surroundings.\n&lt;a href=\"Boots%20of%20the%20Apostle%20%28Item%29\"&gt;Boots of the Apostle&lt;/a&gt;\nThe Boots of the Apostle are a true mystery. The wearer of the boots is rumours to be able to levitate, though nobody has ever seen them used.\n&lt;a href=\"The%20Mentor%27s%20Ring\"&gt;The Mentor's Ring&lt;/a&gt;\nThis ring is a prized possession for any apprentice to magic. It lends the wearer the ability to increase their &lt;a href=\"Intelligence\"&gt;Intelligence&lt;/a&gt; and Wisdom, thus making their use of magic more efficient. The High Wizard &lt;a href=\"Carni%20Asron\"&gt;Carni Asron&lt;/a&gt; is said to be the creator of the Ring. It was a construct for his young apprentices while studying under his guidance. After Asron's death, the Ring and several other possessions vanished and have been circulated throughout Tamriel.\n&lt;a href=\"Ring%20of%20the%20Wind\"&gt;Ring of the Wind&lt;/a&gt;\nNo facts are known about this Ring, but the title and the few rumors lend one to think it grants the wearer added speed.\n&lt;a href=\"Vampiric%20Ring\"&gt;Vampiric Ring&lt;/a&gt;\nOne of the more deadly and rare artifacts in Tamriel is the Vampiric Ring. It is said that the Ring has the power to steal its victim's health and grant it to the wearer. The exact nature and origin of the Ring is wholly unknown, but many elders speak of its evil creation in &lt;a href=\"Morrowind\"&gt;Morrowind&lt;/a&gt; long, long ago by a cult of &lt;a href=\"Vampire\"&gt;Vampire&lt;/a&gt; followers. The Vampiric Ring is an extremely rare artifact and is only seen every few hundred cycles of the moons.\n&lt;a href=\"Eleidon%27s%20Ward\"&gt;Eleidon's Ward&lt;/a&gt;\n&lt;a href=\"Eleidon\"&gt;Eleidon&lt;/a&gt; was a holy knight of legend in &lt;a href=\"Breton\"&gt;Breton&lt;/a&gt; history. He was a sought after man for his courage and determination to set all wrongs right. In one story, it is said that he rescued a Baron's daughter from sure death at the hands of an evil warlord. For his reward, the Baron spent all of his riches to have an enchanted shield built for Eidelon. The Shield granted Eleidon the opportunity to heal his wounds.\n&lt;a href=\"Staff%20of%20Hasedoki\"&gt;Staff of Hasedoki&lt;/a&gt;\n&lt;a href=\"Hasedoki\"&gt;Hasedoki&lt;/a&gt; was said to have been a very competitive wizard. He wandered the land in search for a wizard who was greater than he. To the best of all knowledge, he never found a wizard who could meet up to his challenge. It is said that he felt so lonely and isolated because so many feared his power, that he bonded his life-force into his very own staff, where his soul remains to this very day. Magic users all over Tamriel have been searching for this magical staff. Granting its wielder a protection of magicka, it is a sure prize for any magic user.\n&lt;a href=\"Bloodworm%20Helm\"&gt;Bloodworm Helm&lt;/a&gt;\nThe &lt;a href=\"Mannimarco\"&gt;King of Worms&lt;/a&gt; was said to have left behind one of his prized possessions, the Bloodworm Helm. The Helm is a construct of magically formed bone. The Helm allows the user to summon skeletons and control the undead. It would be a prized artifact to a necromancer.\n&lt;a href=\"Dragonbone%20Mail\"&gt;Dragonbone Mail&lt;/a&gt;\nThis cuirass is one of the greatest artifacts any collector or hero could own. It is constructed of real dragon bone and was enchanted by the first &lt;a href=\"Imperial%20Battlemage\"&gt;Imperial Battlemage&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Zurin%20Arctus\"&gt;Zurin Arctus&lt;/a&gt;, in the early years of the &lt;a href=\"Third%20Era\"&gt;Third Era&lt;/a&gt;. It is a truly exquisite piece of work and many have sought to possess it. The properties of the Cuirass allow the wearer to be resist fire, and to damage an enemy with a blast of fire. Little is known about the involvement of Zurin Arctus with the enchantment of the Cuirass, but an old tale speaks of a debt that he owed to a traveling warrior. Like the warrior, the Dragonbone Mail never stays put for long.\n&lt;a href=\"Skull%20Crusher\"&gt;Skull Crusher&lt;/a&gt;\nThe Skull Crusher is an amazingly large, and powerful weapon. The Warhammer was created in a fire, magically fueled by the Wizard, &lt;a href=\"Dorach%20Gusal\"&gt;Dorach Gusal&lt;/a&gt;, and was forged by the great weaponsmith, &lt;a href=\"Hilbongard%20Rolamus\"&gt;Hilbongard Rolamus&lt;/a&gt;. The steel is magically hardened and the weight of the weapon is amazingly light, which makes for more powerful swings and deadly blows. The Warhammer was to be put on display for a festival, but thieves got it first. The Skull Crusher still travels Tamriel in search of its creators.\n&lt;a href=\"Goldbrand\"&gt;Goldbrand&lt;/a&gt;\nThis magical Sword is almost a complete mystery. Thieves tell tales about its golden make and how it was actually forged by ancient &lt;a href=\"Dragons%20%28Lore%29\"&gt;Dragons&lt;/a&gt; of the &lt;a href=\"Skyrim\"&gt;North&lt;/a&gt;. Their tales claim that it was given to a great knight who was sworn to protect the dragons. The Sword lends its wielder the ability to do fire damage on an enemy. Goldbrand has not been sighted in recent history and is said to be awaiting a worthy hero.\n&lt;a href=\"Fang%20of%20Haynekhtnamet\"&gt;Fang of Haynekhtnamet&lt;/a&gt;\n&lt;a href=\"Black%20Marsh\"&gt;Black Marsh&lt;/a&gt; was once known to be inhabited with what the &lt;a href=\"Argonians\"&gt;Argonians&lt;/a&gt; called the &lt;a href=\"Wamasus\"&gt;Wamasus&lt;/a&gt;. Northern men considered them to be intelligent dragons with lightning for blood. One such mighty beast, &lt;a href=\"Haynekhtnamet\"&gt;Haynekhtnamet&lt;/a&gt;, was slain by the Northern men, though it took 7 days and nights, and a score of men. One of the surviving men took a fang home as a trophy. The fang was carved down into a blade and fashioned into a small dagger. The Dagger mysteriously houses some of the beast's magical properties and grants the user the ability to do shock damage on an opponent. This unique Dagger is seen occasionally by traveling heroes.\n&lt;a href=\"Umbra\"&gt;Umbra Sword&lt;/a&gt;\nThe Umbra Sword was enchanted by the ancient witch &lt;a href=\"Naenra%20Waerr\"&gt;Naenra Waerr&lt;/a&gt;, and its sole purpose was the entrapment of souls. Used in conjunction with a soul gem, the Sword allows the wielder the opportunity to imprison an enemy's soul in the gem. Naenra was executed for her evil creation, but not before she was able to hide the Sword. The Umbra Sword is very picky when it comes to owners and therefore remains hidden until a worthy one is found.\n&lt;a href=\"Denstagmer%27s%20Ring\"&gt;Denstagmer's Ring&lt;/a&gt;\nAll that is known of this Ring is that it may grant the user protection from certain elements. Even the name &lt;a href=\"Denstagmer\"&gt;Denstagmer&lt;/a&gt; is a mystery.\n&lt;a href=\"Helm%20of%20Oreyn%20Bearclaw\"&gt;Helm of Oreyn Bearclaw&lt;/a&gt;\nOne of &lt;a href=\"Valenwood\"&gt;Valenwood&lt;/a&gt;'s legendary heroes is &lt;a href=\"Oreyn%20Bearclaw\"&gt;Oreyn Bearclaw&lt;/a&gt;. Son of King &lt;a href=\"Faume%20Toad-Eye\"&gt;Faume Toad-Eye&lt;/a&gt;, he was a respected clan hunter and a future leader. Wood Elven legend claims Oreyn single handedly defeated &lt;a href=\"Glenhwyfaunva\"&gt;Glenhwyfaunva&lt;/a&gt;, the witch-serpent of the Elven wood, forever bringing peace to his clan. Oreyn would go on to accomplish numerous other deeds, eventually losing his life to the&lt;a href=\"%20Knahaten%20Flu\"&gt; Knahaten Flu&lt;/a&gt;. His Helm stood as a monument of his stature for future generations to remember. The Helm was lost eventually, as the Clan split, and is now a treasured artifact for adventurers. The Helm of Oreyn Bearclaw is rumored to improve the wearer's agility and endurance.\n&lt;a href=\"Daedric%20Crescent%20Blade\"&gt;Daedric Crescent Blade&lt;/a&gt;\nProbably the most rare and even outlawed item of all the great prizes is the Daedric Crescent Blade. The Blade was used by &lt;a href=\"Mehrunes%20Dagon\"&gt;Mehrunes Dagon&lt;/a&gt;'s &lt;a href=\"Daedric%20Forces%20of%20Destruction\"&gt;Daedric forces&lt;/a&gt; in the capture of the Imperial &lt;a href=\"Battlespire\"&gt;Battlespire&lt;/a&gt;. These extremely unique Blades were gathered up and destroyed after the Battlespire was recaptured by the Empire. All but one it seems. Though the Empire believes them all to be destroyed, it is rumored that one still remains in existence, somewhere in Tamriel, though none have ever seen it. The Blade lends it's wielder the ability to do great damage on an enemy and allows him to paralyze and put heavy wear on his enemy's armor. Quite the prize for any mighty warrior, if it does indeed exist."}

Taneth is a prominent city of &lt;a href=\"the%20Forebears\"&gt;the Forebears&lt;/a&gt;, with it being one of their more influential cities, as it appears throughout history.\nHistory.\n&lt;a href=\"First%20Era\"&gt;First Era&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe Tavan Wave &amp; the Kingdom of Taneth.\nThe city-state of Taneth was one of the many settlements found amidst the waves of the &lt;a href=\"Ra%20Gada\"&gt;Ra Gada&lt;/a&gt;, which began their movement in &lt;a href=\"1E%20808\"&gt;1E 808&lt;/a&gt; from the island of &lt;a href=\"Herne%20%28Island%29\"&gt;Herne&lt;/a&gt;. The wave that moved across the southern coast was known as the &lt;a href=\"Tavan\"&gt;Tavan&lt;/a&gt;, worshippers of &lt;a href=\"Tava\"&gt;Tava&lt;/a&gt;, the Bird Spirit of Air, who guided the survivors of doomed &lt;a href=\"Yokuda\"&gt;Yokuda&lt;/a&gt; to Hammerfell. The Tavan sailed across the southern waters of Hammerfell, landing in places such as &lt;a href=\"Stros%20M%27Kai\"&gt;Stros M'Kai&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Gilane\"&gt;Gilane&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Khefrem%27s%20Boot\"&gt;Khefrem's Boot&lt;/a&gt;. Taneth was in the path as well. From then on, Taneth became a territory of &lt;a href=\"the%20Forebears\"&gt;the Forebears&lt;/a&gt;, and eventually a Kingdom amidst the rising province of Hammerfell. A prominent family had taken residence in Taneth, the &lt;a href=\"Al-Danobia%20Family\"&gt;Al-Danobia Family&lt;/a&gt; ruled as monarchs in Taneth for quite some time.\n&lt;a href=\"Second%20Era\"&gt;Second Era&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe Flower of Taneth &amp; High King Fahara'jad.\nAmidst the &lt;a href=\"Knahaten%20Flu\"&gt;Knahaten Flu&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"2E%20560\"&gt;2E 560&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Fahara%27jad\"&gt;Fahara'jad&lt;/a&gt;, the then Prince of &lt;a href=\"Antiphyllos\"&gt;Antiphyllos&lt;/a&gt; had assumed the throne of &lt;a href=\"Sentinel\"&gt;Sentinel&lt;/a&gt;, being named the High King of Hammerfell. Fahara'jad would then marry, &lt;a href=\"Za-Rifah\"&gt;Za-Rifah&lt;/a&gt;, the Magnifica of Taneth, known throughout her kingdom as the \"Flower of Taneth.\" The two would go on and have three children, &lt;a href=\"Maraya\"&gt;Maraya&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Lakana\"&gt;Lakana&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Azah\"&gt;Azah&lt;/a&gt;. Unfortunately, after giving birth to Azah, Za-Rifah had passed away. But after her marriage with Fahara'jad, her sister, &lt;a href=\"Falorah%20al-Danobia\"&gt;Falorah al-Danobia&lt;/a&gt; assumed the role as Magnifica, ruling Taneth ever since. The Kingdom of Taneth were members of the &lt;a href=\"Daggerfall%20Covenant\"&gt;Daggerfall Covenant&lt;/a&gt;, as the Princess, Maraya married &lt;a href=\"Emeric%20of%20Cumberland\"&gt;Emeric of Cumberland&lt;/a&gt;, the High King of &lt;a href=\"High%20Rock\"&gt;High Rock&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe Thieves Guild Situation &amp; Abah's Landing.\nDuring the &lt;a href=\"Interregnum\"&gt;Interregnum&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"2E%20583\"&gt;2E 583&lt;/a&gt;, the city-state of Taneth was under the reign of Magnifica Falorah, who would take an interest in &lt;a href=\"Abah%27s%20Landing\"&gt;Abah's Landing&lt;/a&gt; when her dowry was stolen from the &lt;a href=\"Al-Danobia%20Tomb\"&gt;Al-Danobia Tomb&lt;/a&gt; by the &lt;a href=\"Thieves%20Guild\"&gt;Thieves Guild&lt;/a&gt;. Because of this heinous act, Magnifica Falorah issued the help of the &lt;a href=\"Iron%20Wheel\"&gt;Iron Wheel&lt;/a&gt;, formerly the &lt;a href=\"Bailiffs%20Guild\"&gt;Bailiffs Guild&lt;/a&gt; of Taneth, to capture the Thieves Guild and send them to Taneth for trial. And so began the hunt for the Thieves Guild in &lt;a href=\"Hew%27s%20Bane\"&gt;Hew's Bane&lt;/a&gt;. To cement control over the city-state, Magnifica Falorah agreed to marry the merchant-lord, &lt;a href=\"Cosh\"&gt;Cosh&lt;/a&gt;, at Hubalajad's Palace in Abah's Landing. However, her wedding was foiled by the Thieves Guild when it was revealed that Cosh was &lt;a href=\"Nicolas\"&gt;Nicolas&lt;/a&gt;, the former master of the Thieves Guild, and the man who stole the dowry. Thus, the Iron Wheel continued their efforts tenfold, and the Thieves Guild attempted to clean their name. Eventually, the Iron Wheel were defeated, and the Guild was saved. Falorah and the Guildmaster, &lt;a href=\"Zeira\"&gt;Zeira&lt;/a&gt; arranged a meeting discussing further business.\n&lt;a href=\"Third%20Era\"&gt;Third Era&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe Battle of Dragontooth &amp; Political Conflict.\nDuring the &lt;a href=\"Camoran%20Usurper%27s%20Invasion\"&gt;Camoran Usurper's Invasion&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"3E%20253\"&gt;3E 253&lt;/a&gt;, both the city-states of Taneth and Rihad were besieged by &lt;a href=\"Haymon%20Camoran\"&gt;Haymon Camoran&lt;/a&gt;, the Camoran Usurper. The &lt;a href=\"Battle%20of%20Dragontooth\"&gt;Battle of Dragontooth&lt;/a&gt; had broken the Forebears defense against the Usurper's Army, paving the way into the &lt;a href=\"Iliac%20Bay\"&gt;Iliac Bay&lt;/a&gt;. The city-states of Taneth and Rihad were the targets of the invasion after a swift victory at the city-state of &lt;a href=\"Kvatch\"&gt;Kvatch&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;a href=\"Gold%20Coast\"&gt;Gold Coast&lt;/a&gt;. Many believed that the twin cities of the Forebears were able to withstand the Usurper, but they were ultimately proven wrong when both Taneth and Rihad fell to the Usurper. The defeat at Dragontooth was said to be a reason as to why the Forebears did not aid &lt;a href=\"the%20Crowns\"&gt;the Crowns&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Elinhir\"&gt;Elinhir&lt;/a&gt; at the &lt;a href=\"War%20of%20Bend%27r-Mahk\"&gt;War of Bend'r-Mahk&lt;/a&gt;, as they did not help the Forebears in their cry for help.\nTaneth during the Imperial Simulacrum.\nDuring the &lt;a href=\"Imperial%20Simulacrum\"&gt;Imperial Simulacrum&lt;/a&gt; from &lt;a href=\"3E%20389\"&gt;3E 389&lt;/a&gt; to &lt;a href=\"3E%20399\"&gt;3E 399&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Emperor\"&gt;Emperor&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Uriel%20Septim%20VII\"&gt;Uriel Septim VII&lt;/a&gt; was imprisoned along with &lt;a href=\"Talin%20Warhaft\"&gt;Talin Warhaft&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;a href=\"Deadlands\"&gt;Deadlands&lt;/a&gt; by &lt;a href=\"Jagar%20Tharn\"&gt;Jagar Tharn&lt;/a&gt;. Tharn planned for months to capture the throne, and he was able to achieve so in the span of ten years. Tharn had a powerful weapon called the &lt;a href=\"Staff%20of%20Chaos\"&gt;Staff of Chaos&lt;/a&gt;, and he split it into nine pieces and scattered them across Tamriel, the staff was the only thing keeping Uriel Septim and Warhaft in &lt;a href=\"Oblivion\"&gt;Oblivion&lt;/a&gt;. A warrior escaped his clutches and traveled all corners of Tamriel to retrieve the missing pieces. The hero was known as the &lt;a href=\"Eternal%20Champion\"&gt;Eternal Champion&lt;/a&gt;, and he assembled the staff and defeated Jagar Tharn at the &lt;a href=\"Imperial%20Palace\"&gt;Imperial Palace&lt;/a&gt;. The Eternal Champion had at one point visited the city of Taneth in their quest to recover the pieces. The city of Taneth was under the rule of &lt;a href=\"King%20Lhezem\"&gt;King Lhezem&lt;/a&gt;.\nQueen Clavilla &amp; King Lhotun's Kingdom.\nDuring the waning years of the third era, the Kingdom of Taneth was ruled by &lt;a href=\"Queen%20Clavilla\"&gt;Queen Clavilla&lt;/a&gt;, who like many others, was against the reign of &lt;a href=\"King%20Lhotun\"&gt;King Lhotun&lt;/a&gt; at the &lt;a href=\"Kingdom%20of%20Sentinel\"&gt;Kingdom of Sentinel&lt;/a&gt;, and his inclusion of &lt;a href=\"the%20Lhotunics\"&gt;the Lhotunics&lt;/a&gt;. Clavilla's campaign against this is one of the more well-known, where she tried to revoke all independent charter guilds from Sentinel, however, this ended in failure, as none of them were removed. Her reasoning was that worship of &lt;a href=\"Satakal\"&gt;Satakal&lt;/a&gt; was heresy in the &lt;a href=\"Third%20Empire\"&gt;Third Empire&lt;/a&gt;. Meanwhile, the True Crowns in Elinhir, under the command of &lt;a href=\"Ayaan-si\"&gt;Ayaan-si&lt;/a&gt;, led a rebellion against the King, eventually liberating the &lt;a href=\"Fiefdom%20of%20Totambu\"&gt;Fiefdom of Totambu&lt;/a&gt;. By the time the &lt;a href=\"Oblivion%20Crisis\"&gt;Oblivion Crisis&lt;/a&gt; had arrived, the warfront had returned back into Totambu, with no clear winner.\n&lt;a href=\"Fourth%20Era\"&gt;Fourth Era&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe Great War &amp; the Fall of Taneth.\nDuring the &lt;a href=\"Great%20War\"&gt;Great War&lt;/a&gt; sometime after &lt;a href=\"4E%20175\"&gt;4E 175&lt;/a&gt;, the city-state of Taneth was besieged, taken control by the &lt;a href=\"Third%20Aldmeri%20Dominion\"&gt;Third Aldmeri Dominion&lt;/a&gt;. Supposedly, the Kingdom of Taneth could have held their own against the Dominion, had they not been compromised by a traitor from within. It was said that &lt;a href=\"Saadia\"&gt;Iman&lt;/a&gt;, a noblewoman had traded secrets with the Dominion, which resulted in Taneth's downfall. For treason, the nobles of Taneth had sent warriors of the &lt;a href=\"Alik%27r%20Desert\"&gt;Alik'r&lt;/a&gt; to bring her back for trial. Iman fled to the northern province of &lt;a href=\"Skyrim\"&gt;Skyrim&lt;/a&gt;, where she hid as a barmaid in &lt;a href=\"Whiterun\"&gt;Whiterun&lt;/a&gt; by &lt;a href=\"4E%20201\"&gt;4E 201&lt;/a&gt;, adopting the name Saadia and claiming that she spoke out against the Dominion. It is unknown whether she was brought back to Taneth, or if she escaped further away. The battle against the Dominion in Hammerfell would last for five or so years, eventually ending with the &lt;a href=\"Second%20Treaty%20of%20Stros%20M%27kai\"&gt;Second Treaty of Stros M'kai&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"4E%20180\"&gt;4E 180&lt;/a&gt;."}

Tanks are \"meat shields,\" so to speak, putting themselves between monsters and the rest of the group. The other main roles in most groups are &lt;a href=\"DPS\"&gt;damage dealers&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Healer%20%28Online%29\"&gt;healers&lt;/a&gt;.\nBelow is a primer for\u00a0&lt;a href=\"Veteran%20Rank\"&gt;Veteran Rank&lt;/a&gt; Players on tanking, but any player of any level can follow it.\nTanking basics.\nA Tank's role is protecting the other, more vulnerable group members from harm by keeping the monsters attacking them instead of the rest of the group. This is done by keeping themselves alive, using &lt;a href=\"taunt\"&gt;taunt&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"crowd%20control\"&gt;crowd control&lt;/a&gt; (CC) abilities and taking advantage of a mechanic known as &lt;a href=\"aggression\"&gt;aggression&lt;/a&gt;, or \"aggro,\" to stop monsters from attacking the group.\nMany monsters determine their target through a mechanic known as aggression, or aggro as it is known to players. Aggro is caused by damaging enemies, healing attackers of enemies, and using taunt abilities. A monster will thus attack the player who instills the most aggro, and will change targets if another player instills higher aggro.\nTanks have three main things to do, in order of importance:\nSufficient aggro generation is the key to tanking effectively.\nSurvivability.\nThe most important aspect of a tank is survivability. Without survivability, a tank is essentially just a damage dealer who gets themselves killed every time they run into a pack of enemies, and all their groupmates are killed.\nFirst and foremost, tanks must be able to withstand quite a bit of damage, because they'll be getting a lot of it. For this, &lt;a href=\"Heavy%20Armor%20%28Online%29\"&gt;heavy armor&lt;/a&gt; is most suitable for tanks as they provide a high armor rating (which mitigates damage from hits) and substantial health bonuses. But armor isn't enough; a lot of aspects depend on good survivability, such as &lt;a href=\"Races%20%28Online%29\"&gt;race&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Classes%20%28Online%29\"&gt;class&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"passives\"&gt;passives&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Enchanting%20%28Online%29\"&gt;enchantments&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Food%20%28Online%29\"&gt;food&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Skills%20%28Online%29\"&gt;abilities&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Weapons%20%28Online%29\"&gt;weapon&lt;/a&gt; choices. Any combination of these can tank and do it effectively, but there are, of course, the most effective ways.\nRemember that what is mentioned below is NOT a requirement for all tanks. They are just recommended things that are good for tanks, and players can use whatever playstyle they wish.\nThe first step is to obtain a very high pool of health and armor rating. Tanks depend on all three resources, but health is the most important. &lt;a href=\"The%20Lord%20%28Online%29\"&gt;The Lord&lt;/a&gt; grants a boost to health, and so is the best &lt;a href=\"Mundus%20Stones%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Mundus Stone&lt;/a&gt; for tanks. Heavy Armor grants boosts to health, health regeneration and boast the highest armor rating. Combined with 49 points in health (for Veteran Rank players, lower level players can use whatever attribute combo they wish) and Consummate food which increases all three resource pools, tanks will have a vast resource pool. Also remember to keep food bonuses up at all times.\nThe next step is to obtain a good ability combination. Area of Effect abilities are an absolute\u00a0must for tanking, and at least one AoE crowd control and one taunt ability should be on your action bar. You should be able to use these abilities frequently, so potions are helpful too.\nAs said above, you may use whatever you want, but above is the most recommended and arguably the most effective way of tanking."}

As the next guard leapt over Volraine's burning remains, I turned his sword away with a bolt of lightning to the throat, and the weapon slid neatly into the chest of a third guard. It stunned me how warm the blood was. Suddenly my hands were covered in it, and I marveled at the balmy fluid. It was like wearing the finest velvet gloves in the land, and it amused me to no end. For the first time since my capture, I laughed. I roared.\nEventually, they sent another contingent of guards to search for the first. By then, I had decided I would stay\u2014for a little while, at least. I wanted to see the looks on their faces when they found the bodies of their comrades."}

Ayem took a netchiman's wife and said:\n'I am the Face-Snaked Queen of the &lt;a href=\"Tribunal\"&gt;Three in One&lt;/a&gt;. In you is an image and a seven-syllable spell, AYEM AE SEHTI AE VEHK, which you will repeat to it until mystery comes.'\nThen Ayem threw the netchiman's wife into the ocean water where &lt;a href=\"Dreugh%20%28Morrowind%29\"&gt;dreughs&lt;/a&gt; took her into castles of glass and coral. They gifted the netchiman's wife with gills and milk fingers, changing her sex so that she might give birth to the image as an egg. There she stayed for seven or eight months.\nThen &lt;a href=\"Seht\"&gt;Seht&lt;/a&gt; came to the netchiman's wife and said:\n'I am the Clockwork King of the &lt;a href=\"Tribunal\"&gt;Three in One&lt;/a&gt;. In you is an egg of my brother-sister, who possesses invisible knowledge of words and swords, which you shall nurture until the &lt;a href=\"Nerevar\"&gt;Hortator&lt;/a&gt; comes.'\nAnd Seht then extended his hands and multitudes of homunculi came forth, each like a glimmering rope through the water, and they raised the netchiman's wife back to the surface world and set her down on the shoals of &lt;a href=\"Azura%27s%20Coast\"&gt;Azura's Coast&lt;/a&gt;. There she lay for seven or eight more months, caring for the egg-knowledge by whispering to it the Codes of &lt;a href=\"Mephala\"&gt;Mephala&lt;/a&gt; and the prophecies of &lt;a href=\"Veloth\"&gt;Veloth&lt;/a&gt; and even the forbidden teachings of &lt;a href=\"Trinimac\"&gt;Trinimac&lt;/a&gt;.\nSeven &lt;a href=\"Daedra\"&gt;Daedra&lt;/a&gt; came to her one night and each one gave to the egg new motions that could be achieved by certain movements of the bones. These are called the Barons of Move Like This. Then an eighth Daedroth came, and he was a &lt;a href=\"Demiprince\"&gt;Demiprince&lt;/a&gt;, called &lt;a href=\"Fa-Nuit-Hen\"&gt;Fa-Nuit-Hen&lt;/a&gt;, or the Multiplier of Motions Known. And Fa-Nuit-Hen said:\n'Whom do you wait for?'\nTo which the netchiman's wife said to the &lt;a href=\"Hortator\"&gt;Hortator&lt;/a&gt;.\n'Go to the land of the &lt;a href=\"House%20Indoril\"&gt;Indoril&lt;/a&gt; in three months' time, for that is when war comes. I return now to haunt the warriors who fell and still wonder why. But first I show you this.'\nThen the Barons and the Demiprince joined together into a pillar of fighting styles terrible to behold and they danced before the egg and its learning image.\n'Look, little &lt;a href=\"Vehk\"&gt;Vehk&lt;/a&gt;, and find the face behind the splendor of my bladed carriage, for in it is delivered the unmixed conflict path, perfect in every way. What is its number?'\nIt is said the number is the number of birds that can nest in an ancient tibrol tree, less three grams of honest work, but Vivec in his later years found a better one and so gave this secret to his people.\n'For I have crushed a world with my left hand,' he will say, 'but in my right hand is how it could have won against me. Love is under my will only.'\nThe ending of the words is &lt;a href=\"ALMSIVI\"&gt;ALMSIVI&lt;/a&gt;.\nSermon 2.\nThe netchiman's wife who carried the egg of &lt;a href=\"Vivec\"&gt;Vivec&lt;/a&gt; within her went looking for the lands of the &lt;a href=\"House%20Indoril\"&gt;Indoril&lt;/a&gt;. Along the journey many spirits came to see her and offer instructions to her son-daughter, the future glorious invisible warrior-poet of &lt;a href=\"Vvardenfell\"&gt;Vvardenfell&lt;/a&gt;, Vivec. The first spirit threw his arms about her and hugged his knowledge in tight. The netchiman's wife became soaked in the Incalculable Effort. The egg was delighted and did somersaults inside her, bowing to the five corners of the world and saying:\n\"Thus whoever performs this holy act shall be proud and mighty among the rest!\"\nThe second spirit was too aloof and acted above his station so much that he was driven off by a headache spell. The third spirit, At-Hatoor, came down to the netchiman's wife while she relaxed for a while under an &lt;a href=\"Emperor%20Parasol\"&gt;Emperor Parasol&lt;/a&gt;. His garments were made from implications of meaning, and the egg looked at them three times. The first time Vivec said:\n\"Ha, it means nothing!\"\nAfter looking a second time he said:\n\"Hmm, there might be something there after all.\"\nFinally, giving At-Hatoor's garments a sidelong glance, he said:\n\"Amazing, the ability to infer significance in something devoid of detail!\"\n\"There is a proverb,\" At-Hatoor said, and then he left.\nThe fourth spirit came with the fifth, for they were cousins. They could ghost touch and probed inside the egg to find its core. Some say Vivec at this point was shaped like a star with its penumbra broken off; others, that it looked like a revival of vanished forms.\n\"From my side of the family,\" the first cousin said, \"I bring you a series of calamities that will bring about the end of the universe.\"\n\"And from my side,\" the second cousin said, \"I bring you all the primordial marriages that must happen within them, each one.\"\nAt this the egg laughed. \"I am given too much to bear so young. I must have been born before.\"\nAnd then the sixth spirit appeared, the &lt;a href=\"Black%20Hand\"&gt;Black Hand&lt;/a&gt;s &lt;a href=\"Mephala\"&gt;Mephala&lt;/a&gt;, who taught the Velothi at the beginning of days all the arts of sex and murder. Its burning heart melted the eyes of the netchiman's wife and took the egg from her belly with six cutting strokes. The egg-image, however, could see into what it had been before in ancient times, when the earth still cooled, and was not blinded.\nIt joined with the &lt;a href=\"Daedra\"&gt;Daedroth&lt;/a&gt; and took its former secrets, leaving a few behind to keep the web of the world from disentangling. Then the Black Hands Mephala put the egg back into the netchiman's wife and blew on her with magic breath until the hole closed up. But the Daedroth did not give her back her eyes, saying:\n\"God hath three keys; of birth, of machines, and of the words between.\"\nWithin this Sermon the wise may find one half of these keys.\nThe ending of the words is &lt;a href=\"ALMSIVI\"&gt;ALMSIVI&lt;/a&gt;.\nSermon 3.\nBeing blind the netchiman's wife wandered into a cave on her way to the domains of &lt;a href=\"House%20Indoril\"&gt;House Indoril&lt;/a&gt;. It so happened that this cave was a Dwemeri stronghold. The &lt;a href=\"Dwemer\"&gt;Dwemer&lt;/a&gt; spied the egg and captured the netchiman's wife. They bound her head to foot and brought her deep within the earth.\nShe heard one say, 'Go and make a simulacrum of her and place it back on the surface, for she has something akin to what we have and so the &lt;a href=\"Veloth\"&gt;Veloth&lt;/a&gt;i will covet it and notice if she is too long away.'\nIn the darkness, the netchiman's wife felt great knives try to cut her open. When the knives did not work, the Dwemer used solid sounds. When those did not work, great heat was brought to bear. Nothing was of any use, and the egg of Vivec remained safe within her.\nA Dwemer said, 'Nothing is of any use. We must go and misinterpret this.'\n&lt;a href=\"Vivec\"&gt;Vivec&lt;/a&gt; felt that his mother was afraid, and so consoled her.\n'The fire is mine: let it consume thee,And make a secret doorAt the altar of Padhome,In the House of &lt;a href=\"Boethiah\"&gt;Boet-hi-Ah&lt;/a&gt;Where we become safeAnd looked after.'\nThis old prayer made the netchiman's wife smile and begin such a deep sleep that when Dwemeri atronachs returned with cornered spheres and cut her apart she did not awake and died peacefully. Vivec was removed from her womb and placed within a magical glass for further study. To confound his captors, he channeled his essence into love, an emotion the Dwemer knew nothing about.\nThe egg said:\n'Love is used not only as a constituent in moods and affairs, but also as the raw material from which relationships produce hour-later exasperations, regrettably fashioned restrictions, riddles laced with affections known only to the loving couple, and looks that linger too long. Love is also an often-used ingredient in some transparent verbal and nonverbal transactions where, eventually, it can sometimes be converted to a variety of true devotions, some of which yield tough, insoluble, and infusible unions. In its basic form, love supplies approximately thirteen draughts of all energy that is derived from relationships. Its role and value in society at large are controversial.'\nThe Dwemer were vexed at these words and tried to hide behind their power symbols. They sent their atronachs to remove the egg-image from their cave and place it within the simulacrum they had made of Vivec's mother.\nA &lt;a href=\"Dwemer\"&gt;Dwemer&lt;/a&gt; said, 'We Dwemer are only aspirants to this that the Velothi have. They shall be our doom in this and the eight known worlds, &lt;a href=\"Nirn\"&gt;NIRN&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Lorkhan\"&gt;LHKAN&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Arkay\"&gt;RKHET&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Stendarr\"&gt;THENDR&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Kynareth\"&gt;KYNRT&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Arkay\"&gt;AKHAT&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Mara\"&gt;MHARA&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Jhunal\"&gt;JHUNAL&lt;/a&gt;.' The secret to doom is within this Sermon.\nThe ending of the words is &lt;a href=\"ALMSIVI\"&gt;ALMSIVI&lt;/a&gt;.\nSermon 4.\nThe simulacrum of the netchiman's wife who carried the egg of &lt;a href=\"Vivec\"&gt;Vivec&lt;/a&gt; within it went back to looking for the lands of the Indoril. Along the journey many more spirits came to see it and offer instructions to its son-daughter, the future glorious invisible warrior-poet of &lt;a href=\"Vvardenfell\"&gt;Vvardenfell&lt;/a&gt;, Vivec.\nA troupe of spirits called the Lobbyists for the Coincidence Guild appeared. Vivec understood the challenge immediately and said:\n'The popular notion of God kills happenstance.'\nThe head of the Lobbyists, whose name is forgotten, tried to defend the concept's existence. He said, 'Saying something at the same time can be magical.'\nVivec knew that to retain his divinity that he must make a strong argument against luck. He said:\n'Is not the sudden revelation of corresponding conditions and disparate elements that gel at the moment of the coincidence one of the prerequisites to being, in fact, coincidental? Synchronicity comes out of repeated coincidences at the lowest level. Further examination shows it is the utter power of the sheer number of coincidences that leads one to the idea that synchronicity is guided by something more than chance. Therefore, synchronicity ends up invalidating the concept of the coincidental, even though they are the symptomatic signs that bring it to the surface.'\nThus was coincidence destroyed in the land of the &lt;a href=\"Veloth\"&gt;Veloth&lt;/a&gt;i.\nThen an &lt;a href=\"Ehlnofey\"&gt;Old Bone of the earth&lt;/a&gt; rose up before the simulacrum of the netchiman's wife and said, 'If you are to be born a ruling king of the world you must confuse it with new words. Set me into pondering.'\n'Very well,' Vivec said, 'Let me talk to you of the world, which I share with mystery and love. Who is her capital? Have you taken the scenic route of her cameo? I have\u2014lightly, in secret, missing candles because they're on the untrue side, and run my hand along the edge of a shadow made from one hundred and three divisions of warmth, and left no proof.'\nAt this the Old Bone folded unto itself twenty times until it became akin to milk, which Vivec drank, becoming a ruling king of the world.\nFinally the Chancellor of Exactitude appeared, and he was perfect to look upon from every angle. Vivec understood the challenge immediately and said:\n'Certitude is for the &lt;a href=\"Dwemer\"&gt;puzzle-box logicians&lt;/a&gt; and girls of white glamour who harbor it on their own time. I am a letter written in uncertainty.'\nThe Chancellor bowed his head and smiled fifty different and perfect ways all at once. He pulled the astrolabe of the universe from his robe and broke it in half, handing both halves to the egg-image of Vivec.\nVivec laughed and said, 'Yes, I know. The slave labor of the senses is as selfish as polar ice, and worsens when energies are spent on a life others regard as fortunate. To be a ruling king I will have to suffer much that cannot be suffered, and to weigh matters that no astrolabe or compass can measure.'\nThe ending of the words is &lt;a href=\"ALMSIVI\"&gt;ALMSIVI&lt;/a&gt;.\nSermon 5.\nFinally the simulacrum of the netchiman's wife became unstable. The &lt;a href=\"Dwemer\"&gt;Dwemer&lt;/a&gt; in their haste had built it shoddily and the ashes of &lt;a href=\"Red%20Mountain\"&gt;Red Mountain&lt;/a&gt; slowed its golden tendons. Before long it fell on its knees beside the road to the lands of the &lt;a href=\"House%20Indoril\"&gt;Indoril&lt;/a&gt; and pitched over, to be discovered eighty days later by a &lt;a href=\"Merchants%20%28Morrowind%29\"&gt;merchant&lt;/a&gt; caravan on its way to the capital of &lt;a href=\"Veloth\"&gt;Veloth&lt;/a&gt;, anon &lt;a href=\"Almalexia\"&gt;Almalexia&lt;/a&gt;.\nVivec had not been among his people all the days of his pre-life so he stayed silent and let the Chimer in the caravan think that the simulacrum was broken and empty.\nA &lt;a href=\"Chimer\"&gt;Chimer&lt;/a&gt;i warrior, who was protecting the caravan, said, 'Look here how the Dwemer try to fool us as ever, crafting our likenesses out of their flesh-metals. We should take this to the capital and show our mother Ayem. She will want to see this new strategy of our enemies.'\nBut the merchant captain said, 'I doubt that we shall be paid well for the effort. We can make more money if we stop at Noormoc and sell it to the Red Wives of &lt;a href=\"Mehrunes%20Dagon\"&gt;Dagon&lt;/a&gt;, who pay well for the wonders made by the Deep Folk.'\nBut another Chimer, who was wise in the ways of prophecy, looked on the simulacrum with disquietude. 'Was I not hired on to help you seek the best of fortunes? I say you should listen to your warrior, then, and take this thing to Ayem, for though manufactured by our enemies there is something in it that will become sacred, or has been already.'\nThe merchant captain took pause then and looked on the simulacrum of the netchiman's wife and, though he heeded always the advice of his seers, could do no more than think of the profits to be made at Noormoc. He mainly of the Red Wives' form of recompense, which was four-cornered and good wounded, a belly-magic known nowhere else under the moons. His lust made him deny Ayem his mother. He gave order to change course for Noormoc.\nBefore the caravan could get underway again, the Chimeri warrior who had counseled a passage to the capital threw his money to the merchant captain and said, 'I will pay you thus for the simulacrum and warn you: war is coming with the shaggy men of the north and I will not have my mother Ayem at uneven odds with one enemy while tending to another.'\n'Nerevar,' the merchant captain said, 'this is not enough. I am Triune in my own way, but I follow the road of my body and demand more.'\nThen Vivec could not remain silent anymore and said into Nerevar's head these words:\n'You can hear the words, so run awayCome, &lt;a href=\"Hortator\"&gt;Hortator&lt;/a&gt;, unfold into a clear unknown,Stay quiet until you've slept in the yesterday,And say no elegies for the melting stone'\nSo &lt;a href=\"Nerevar\"&gt;Nerevar&lt;/a&gt; slew the merchant captain and took the caravan for his own.\nThe ending of the words is &lt;a href=\"ALMSIVI\"&gt;ALMSIVI&lt;/a&gt;.\nSermon 6.\nYou have discovered the sixth Sermon of Vivec, which was hidden in the words that came next to the &lt;a href=\"Hortator\"&gt;Hortator&lt;/a&gt;.\nThere is an eon within itself that when unraveled becomes the first sentence of the world.\n&lt;a href=\"Mephala\"&gt;Mephala&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Azura\"&gt;Azura&lt;/a&gt; are the twin gates of tradition and Boethiah is the secret flame.\nThe Sun shall be eaten by lions, which cannot be found yet in Veloth.\nSix are the vests and garments worn by the suppositions of men.\nProceed only with the simplest terms, for all others are enemies and will confuse you.\nSix are the formulas to heaven by violence, one that you have learned by studying these words.\nThe Father is a machine and the mouth of a machine. His only mystery is an invitation to elaborate further.\nThe Mother is active and clawed like a nix-hound, yet she is the holiest of those that reclaim their days.\nThe Son is myself, Vehk, and I am unto three, six, nine, and the rest that come after, glorious and sympathetic, without borders, utmost in the perfections of this world and the others, sword and symbol, pale like gold.\nThere is a fourth kind of philosophy that uses nothing but disbelief.\nFor by the sword I mean the sensible.\nFor by the word I mean the dead.\nI am Vehk, your protector and the protector of &lt;a href=\"Red%20Mountain\"&gt;Red Mountain&lt;/a&gt; until the end of days, which are numbered 3333.\nBelow me is the savage, which we needed to remove ourselves from the Altmer.\nAbove me is a challenge, which bathes itself in fire and the essence of a god.\nThrough me you are desired, unlike the prophets that have borne your name before.\nSix are the walking ways, from enigma to enemy to teacher.\n&lt;a href=\"Boethiah\"&gt;Boethiah&lt;/a&gt; and Azura are the principles of the universal plot, which is begetting, which is creation, and Mephala makes of it an art form.\nFor by the sword I mean the first night.\nFor by the word I mean the dead.\nThere will be a splendor in your name when it is said to be true.\nSix are the guardians of &lt;a href=\"Veloth\"&gt;Veloth&lt;/a&gt;, three before and they are born again, and they will test you until you have the proper tendencies of the hero.\nThere is a world that is sleeping and you must guard against it.\nFor by the sword I mean the dual nature.\nFor by the word I mean animal life.\nFor by the sword I mean preceded by a sigh.\nFor by the word I mean preceded by a wolf.\nThe ending of the words is &lt;a href=\"ALMSIVI\"&gt;ALMSIVI&lt;/a&gt;.\nSermon 7.\nAs the caravan of &lt;a href=\"Nerevar\"&gt;Nerevar&lt;/a&gt; now made for the capital of &lt;a href=\"Veloth\"&gt;Veloth&lt;/a&gt;, anon &lt;a href=\"Almalexia\"&gt;Almalexia&lt;/a&gt;, there came great rumblings from the &lt;a href=\"Oblivion%20%28Realm%29\"&gt;Oblivion&lt;/a&gt;. A duke among &lt;a href=\"Scamp%20%28Morrowind%29\"&gt;scamps&lt;/a&gt; wandered into the &lt;a href=\"House%20of%20Troubles\"&gt;House of Troubles&lt;/a&gt;, pausing before each scripture door to pay his respects, until finally he was met by the major domo of Mehrunes Dagon.\nThe Duke of Scamps said, 'I was summoned by &lt;a href=\"Mehrunes%20Dagon\"&gt;Lord Dagon&lt;/a&gt;, master of the foul waters and fire, and I have brought the pennants of my seven legions.'\nThe major domo, whose head was a bubble of foul water and fire, bowed low, so that the head of the Duke of Scamps became enclosed in his own.\nHe saw the first pennant, which commanded a legion of grim warriors who could die at least twice.\nHe saw the second pennant, which commanded a legion of winged bulls and the emperor of color that rode upon each.\nHe saw the third pennant, which commanded a legion of inverted gorgons, great snakes whose scales were the faces of men.\nHe saw the fourth pennant, which commanded a legion of double-crossed lovers.\nHe saw the fifth pennant, which commanded a legion of jumping wounds looking to hop onto a victim.\nHe saw the sixth pennant, which commanded a legion of abridged planets.\nHe saw the seventh pennant, which commanded a legion of armored winning moves.\nTo which the major domo said, 'Duke Kh-Utta, your legions while mighty are not enough to destroy Nerevar or the Triune way. Look upon the &lt;a href=\"Hortator\"&gt;Hortator&lt;/a&gt; and see the wisdom he takes to wife.'\nAnd they looked into the middle world and saw:\nEvaporating in a throng of thunderOf red war and chitin men,Where destinesTake him further from our waysThe heat that we have wantedAnd pray they still remember,Where destinesClothe the distance,Glad in the golden east that we saw it now,Instead of the war and repairOf the oblivious fractureA curse on the HortatorAnd two more on his hands\nAnd the Duke of Scamps saw the palms of the Hortator, upon which the egg had written these words of power:\nGHARTOK &lt;a href=\"Padomay\"&gt;PADHOME&lt;/a&gt; GHARTOK PADHOME.\nThe ending of the words is &lt;a href=\"ALMSIVI\"&gt;ALMSIVI&lt;/a&gt;.\nSermon 8.\nAnd presently &lt;a href=\"Nerevar\"&gt;Nerevar&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Vivec\"&gt;Vivec&lt;/a&gt; were within sight of the capital and the Four Corners of the &lt;a href=\"House%20of%20Troubles\"&gt;House of Troubles&lt;/a&gt; knew that it was not time to contest them. The caravan musicians made a great song of entrance and the eleven gates of the &lt;a href=\"Mournhold\"&gt;Mourning Hold&lt;/a&gt; were thrown wide.\nAyem was accompanied by her husband-state, a flickering image that was channeled to her ever-changing female need. Around her were the Shouts, a guild now forgotten, who carried with them the whims of the people, for the &lt;a href=\"Chimer\"&gt;Velothi&lt;/a&gt; then were still mostly good at heart. The Shouts were the counselors of Ayem and the country, though they sometimes quarreled and needed Seht to wring them into usefulness. Ayem approached Nerevar, who was by now adorned in the flags of &lt;a href=\"House%20Indoril\"&gt;House Indoril&lt;/a&gt;. He gifted her with the simulacrum of the netchiman's wife and the egg of Vivec inside.\nAyem said to Nerevar, 'Seht who is &lt;a href=\"Azura\"&gt;Azura&lt;/a&gt; has revealed that war is come and that the &lt;a href=\"Hortator\"&gt;Hortator&lt;/a&gt; that shall deliver us will approach with a solution walking at his side.'\nNerevar said, 'I have traveled out of my way to warn you of the deceit of our enemies, the &lt;a href=\"Dwemer\"&gt;Dwemer&lt;/a&gt;, but I have learned much on the journey and have changed my mind. This netchiman's wife you see at my side is a sword and a symbol and there is prophecy inside. It tells me that, like it, we must for awhile be like he is and, as a people, cloaked in our former enemies, and to use their machines without shame.'\nAt which Vivec spoke aloud, '&lt;a href=\"Boethiah\"&gt;Boethiah&lt;/a&gt;-who-is-you wore the skin of &lt;a href=\"Trinimac\"&gt;Trinimac&lt;/a&gt; to cleanse the faults of &lt;a href=\"Veloth\"&gt;Veloth&lt;/a&gt;, my Queen, and so it should be again. This is the walking way of the glorious.'\nSeht appeared out of a cloud of iron vapor and his minions made of their blood a chair. He sat beside Ayem and looked on the rebirth of mastery.\nVivec said to them, his &lt;a href=\"Tribunal\"&gt;Triune&lt;/a&gt;:\n'My rituals and ordeals and all the rhymes within,Use no other motive than the revelation of my skin.'\nAyem said, 'AYEM AE SEHTI AE VEHK. We are delivered and made whole, the diamond of the Black Hands is uncovered.'\nSeht said, 'Wherever so he treads, there is invisible scripture.'\nTo which the Shouts were silent in sudden reading.\nVivec then reached out from the egg all his limbs and features, merging with the simulacrum of his mother, gilled and blended in all the arts of the star-wounded East, under water and in fire and in metal and in ash, six times the wise, and he became the union of male and female, the magic &lt;a href=\"hermaphrodite\"&gt;hermaphrodite&lt;/a&gt;, the martial axiom, the sex-death of language and unique in all the middle world.\nHe said, 'Let us now guide the hands of the Hortator in war and its aftermath. For we go different, and in thunder. This is our destiny.'\nThe ending of the words is &lt;a href=\"ALMSIVI\"&gt;ALMSIVI&lt;/a&gt;.\nSermon 9.\nThen came the war with the northern men, where &lt;a href=\"Vivec\"&gt;Vivec&lt;/a&gt; did guide the &lt;a href=\"Hortator\"&gt;Hortator&lt;/a&gt; into swift and tricky union with the &lt;a href=\"Dwemer\"&gt;Dwemer&lt;/a&gt;. The greatest demon chieftains of the frigid west were those listed below, five in unholy number.\n&lt;a href=\"Hoag%20Merkiller\"&gt;HOAGA&lt;/a&gt;, the Mouth of Mud, who appeared as a great bearded king, had the powers of Marshalling and breathing the earth. On the battlefields, this demon would often be seen on the sidelines, eating the soil voraciously. When his men fell, Hoaga would fill their bodies back with it, whereupon they would rise again and fight, albeit slower. He had a Secret Name, Fenja, and destroyed seventeen &lt;a href=\"Chimer\"&gt;Chimer&lt;/a&gt;i villages and two Dwemeri strongholds before being turned away.\nCHEMUA, the Running Hunger, who appeared as a mounted soldier with full helm, had the powers of Heart Roaring and of sky sickening. He ate the Chimeri hero, Dres Khizumet-e, sending the spirit back to the Hortator as an assassin. Sometimes called First Blighter, Chemua could give clouds stomach aches and turn the rain of Veloth into bile. He destroyed six Chimeri villages before he was slain by Vivec and the Hortator.\nBHAG, the Two-Tongued, who appeared as a great bearded king, had the powers of Surety and Form Change. His raiders were small in number, but ran amok in the west hinterlands, killing many Velothi trappers and scouts. He fell in a great debate with Vivec, for the warrior-poet alone could understand the northern man's two-layered speech, though ALMSIVI had to remain invisible during the argument.\nBARFOK, Maid of Planes, who appeared as a winged human with lick-encrusted spear, had the powers of Event Denouement. Battles fought against her would always end in victory for Barfok, because she could shape outcomes by singing. Four Chimeri villages and two more Dwemeri strongholds were destroyed by her decision enforcement. Vivec had to stuff her mouth with his milk finger to keep her from singing Veloth into ruin.\n&lt;a href=\"Ysmir\"&gt;YSMIR&lt;/a&gt;, the Dragon of the North, who always appears as a great bearded king, had powers innumerable and echoing. He was grim and dark and the most silent of the invading chieftains, though when he spoke villages were uplifted and thrown into the sea. The Hortator fought him unarmed, grabbing the &lt;a href=\"Dragons%20%28Lore%29\"&gt;Dragon&lt;/a&gt;'s roars by hand until Ysmir's power throat bled. These roars were given to Vivec to bind into an ebony listening frame, which the warrior-poet placed on Ysmir's face and ears to drive him mad and drive him away.\n'The coming forth and the driving away brings all things around. What I shall say next is unpleasant to record: &lt;a href=\"Herma-Mora\"&gt;HERMA-MORA&lt;/a&gt;-ALTADOON! AE ALTADOON!'\nThe ending of the words is &lt;a href=\"ALMSIVI\"&gt;ALMSIVI&lt;/a&gt;.\nSermon 10.\nYou have discovered the tenth Sermon of Vivec, which was hidden in the words that came in the aftermath to the &lt;a href=\"Hortator\"&gt;Hortator&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe evoker shall raise his left hand empty and open, to indicate he needs no weapons of his own. The coming forth is always hidden, so the evoker is always invisible or, better, in the skin of his enemies.\n\"The eyelid of the kingdom shall fill and six folios, but the eye shall read the world.\" By this the Hortator needs me to understand.\nThe sword is an impatient signature. Write no contracts on the dead.\n&lt;a href=\"Vivec\"&gt;Vivec&lt;/a&gt; says unto the Hortator remember the words of Boet-hi-ah:\n\"We pledge ourselves to you, the Frame-maker, the Scarab: a world for us to love you in, a cloak of dirt to cherish. Betrayed by your ancestors when you were not even looking. Hoary &lt;a href=\"Magnus\"&gt;Magnus&lt;/a&gt; and his ventured opinions cannot sway the understated, a trick worthy of the always satisfied. A short season of towers, a rundown absolution, and what is this, what is this but fire under your eyelid?\nShift ye in your skin, I say to the &lt;a href=\"Trinimac\"&gt;Trinimac&lt;/a&gt;-eaters. Pitch your voices into the color of bruise. Divide ye like your enemies, in Houses, and lay your laws in set sequence from the center, again like the enemy Corners of the &lt;a href=\"House%20of%20Troubles\"&gt;House of Troubles&lt;/a&gt;, and see yourself thence as timber, or mud-slats, or sheets of resin. Then do not divide, for yet is the stride of &lt;a href=\"SITHISIT\"&gt;SITHISIT&lt;/a&gt; quicker than the rush of enemies, and He will &lt;a href=\"sunder\"&gt;sunder&lt;/a&gt; the whole for the sake of a shingle.\nFor we go different, and in thunder. SITHISIT is the start of all true Houses, built against and lazy slaves. Turn from your predilections, broken like false maps. Move and move like this. Quicken against false fathers, mothers left in corners weeping for glass and rain. Stasis asks merely for nothing, for itself, which is nothing, as you were in the eight everlasting imperfections.\"\nVivec says unto the Hortator remember the words of Vivec.\n\"UNDERSTAND THAT SITHISIT STILL TRAVELS\"\nVivec says unto the Hortator remember the words of Vivec.\n\"IN A PHOSPHORESCENT MIRROR OF THE SKY\"\nVivec says unto the Hortator remember the words of Vivec.\n\"DROWNED AND SMILING\"\nVivec says unto the Hortator remember the words of Vivec.\n\"INTERMITTENT HOPES ENOUGH\"\nVivec says unto the Hortator remember the words of Vivec.\n\"TO ANSWER ALL THE THINGS\"\nVivec says unto the Hortator remember the words of Vivec.\n\"NOT YET QUERIED\"\nThe ending of the words is &lt;a href=\"ALMSIVI\"&gt;ALMSIVI&lt;/a&gt;.\nSermon 11.\nThese were the days of , when &lt;a href=\"Chimer\"&gt;Chimer&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Dwemer\"&gt;Dwemer&lt;/a&gt; lived under the wise and benevolent rule of the and their champion the Hortator. When the gods of &lt;a href=\"Veloth\"&gt;Veloth&lt;/a&gt; would retreat unto their own, to mold the cosmos and other matters, the Hortator would at times become confused. Vivec would always be there to advise him, and this is the first of the three lessons of ruling kings:\n\"The waking world is the amnesia of dream. All motifs can be mortally wounded. Once slain, themes turn into the structure of future nostalgia. Do not abuse your powers or they will lead you astray. They will leave you like rebellious daughters. They will lose their virtue. They will become lost and resentful and finally become pregnant with the seed of folly. Soon you will be the grandparent of a broken state. You will be mocked. It will fall apart like a stone that recalls that it is really water.\"\n\"Keep nothing in your house that is neither needed or beautiful.\"\n\"Ordeals you should face unimpeded by the world of restriction. The splendor of stars is Ayem's domain. The selfishness of the sea is Seht's. I rule the middle air. All else is earth and under your temporal command. There is no bone that cannot be broken, except for the heart bone. You will see it twice in your lifetimes. Take what you can the first time and let us do the rest.\"\n\"There is no true symbolism of the center. The Sharmat will believe there is. He will feel that he can cause years of exuberance from sitting in the sacred, when really no one can leave that state and cause anything more but strife.\"\n\"There is once more the case of the symbolic and barren. The true prince that is cursed and demonized will be adored at last with full hearts. According to the Codes of &lt;a href=\"Mephala\"&gt;Mephala&lt;/a&gt; there can be no official art, only fixation points of complexity that will erase from the awe of the people given enough time. This is a secret that hides another. An impersonal survival is not the way of the ruling king. Embrace the art of the people and marry it and by that I mean secretly have it murdered.\"\n\"The ruling king that sees in another his equivalent rules nothing.\"\n\"The secret of weapons is this: they are the mercy seat.\"\n\"The secret of language is this: it is immobile.\"\n\"The ruling king is armored head to toe in brilliant flame. He is redeemed by each act he undertakes. His death is only a diagram back to the waking world. He sleeps the second way. The Sharmat is his double, and therefore you wonder if you rule nothing.\"\n\"&lt;a href=\"Hortator\"&gt;Hortator&lt;/a&gt; and Sharmat, one and one, eleven, an inelegant number. Which of the ones is the more important? Could you ever tell if they switched places? I can and that is why you will need me.\"\n\"According to the Codes of Mephala, there is no difference between the theorist and the terrorist. Even the most cherished desire disappears in their hands. This is why Mephala has black hands. Bring both of yours to every argument. The one-handed king finds no remedy. When you approach God, however, cut both of them off. God has no need of theory and he is armored head to toe in terror.\"\nThe ending of the words is &lt;a href=\"ALMSIVI\"&gt;ALMSIVI&lt;/a&gt;.\nSermon 12.\n&lt;a href=\"Hortator\"&gt;Hortator&lt;/a&gt; pondered the first lesson of ruling kings, Vivec wandered into the &lt;a href=\"Mournhold\"&gt;Mourning Hold&lt;/a&gt; and found that Ayem was with a pair of lovers. Seht had divided himself again. &lt;a href=\"Vivec\"&gt;Vivec&lt;/a&gt; then leapt through into their likenesses to observe, but he gained no secrets that he did not already know. He left a few of his own behind to make the journey worthwhile.\nThen Vivec left the capital of Veloth and wandered far into the ash. He found a span of badlands to practice his giant-form. He made of his feet a less dense material than the divine to keep from falling waist-deep into the earth. At this point the First Corner of the House of Troubles, the Prince &lt;a href=\"Molag%20Bal\"&gt;Molag Bal&lt;/a&gt;, made his presence known.\nVivec looked on the King of Rape and said:\n'How very beautiful you are, that you do not join us. '\nAnd Molag Bal crushed the warrior-poet's feet, which were not invulnerable, and had legions cleave them off. Mighty fires from the Beginning Place were brought like nets to hold Vivec and he let them.\n'I would prefer,' he said, 'some kind of ceremony if we are to be married.'\nAnd the legions that took the feet were summoned again and ordered to begin a banquet. Pomegranates sprang from the badlands and tents were raised. A throng of &lt;a href=\"Veloth\"&gt;Veloth&lt;/a&gt;i mystics came, reading the passages of the severed feet on the ground and weeping until the scriptures were wet.\n'We must love each other briefly,' Vivec said, 'if at all. I am needed to counsel the Hortator in more important matters because the &lt;a href=\"Dwemer\"&gt;Dwemer&lt;/a&gt;i high priests stir up trouble. You may have my head for an hour.'\nMolag Bal rose up and extended six arms to show his worth. They were decorated in runes of seduction and its reverse. They were decorated in the annotated calendars of longer worlds. When he spoke, mating monsters fell out. 'Where must it go?' he said.\n'I told you,' Vivec said, 'I am meant to be the teacher of the king of the earth. AE ALTADOON GHARTOK &lt;a href=\"Padomay\"&gt;PADHOME&lt;/a&gt;.'\nWith these magic words, the King of Rape added another: '&lt;a href=\"CHIM\"&gt;CHIM&lt;/a&gt;,' which is the secret syllable of royalty.\nVivec had what he needed from the Daedroth and so married him that day. In the hour that Bal had his head, the King of Rape asked for proof of love.\nVivec spoke two poems to show him such, but only the first is known.\nI'm not sure just how much glass it took to make your hairTwice as much, I am sure, as the oceans have to shareHell, my sweet, is a fiction written by those who tell the truthMy mouth is skilled at lying and its alibi a tooth\nThe sons and daughters of Vivec and Molag Bal number in the thousands. The name of the mightiest is a string of power:\nGULGA MOR JIL HYAET AE HOOM.\nThe ending of the words is &lt;a href=\"ALMSIVI\"&gt;ALMSIVI&lt;/a&gt;.\nSermon 13.\nThese were the days of &lt;a href=\"Resdayn\"&gt;Resdayn&lt;/a&gt;ia, when &lt;a href=\"Chimer\"&gt;Chimer&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Dwemer\"&gt;Dwemer&lt;/a&gt; lived under the wise and benevolent rule of the &lt;a href=\"ALMSIVI\"&gt;ALMSIVI&lt;/a&gt; and their champion the &lt;a href=\"Hortator\"&gt;Hortator&lt;/a&gt;. When the gods of Veloth would retreat unto their own, to mold the cosmos and other matters, the Hortator would at times become confused. Vivec would always be there to advise him, and this is the second of the three lessons of ruling kings:\n'The secret syllable of royalty is this: (You must learn this elsewhere.)\n'The temporal myth is man.\n'The magical cross is an integration of the worth of mortals at the expense of their spirits. Surround it with the triangle and you begin to see the Triune house. It becomes divided into corners, which are ruled by our brethren, the Four Corners: &lt;a href=\"Molag%20Bal\"&gt;BAL&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Mehrunes%20Dagon\"&gt;DAGON&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Malacath\"&gt;MALAC&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Sheogorath\"&gt;SHEOG&lt;/a&gt;. Rotate the triangle and you pierce the heart of the Beginning Place, the foul lie, the testament of the irrefutable-for-a-span. Above them all is the horizon where only one stands, though no one stands there yet. It is proof of the new. It is the promise of the wise. Unfold the whole and what you have is a star, which is not my domain, but not entirely outside my judgment. The grand design takes flight; it is transformed not only into a star but a hornet. The center cannot hold. It becomes devoid of lines and points. It becomes devoid of anything and so becomes a receptacle. This is its usefulness at the end. This is its promise.\n'The sword is the cross and ALMSIVI is the &lt;a href=\"Tribunal\"&gt;Triune house&lt;/a&gt; around it. If there is to be an end I must be removed. The ruling king must know this, and I will test him. I will murder him time and again until he knows this. I am the defender of the last and the last. To remove me is to refill the heart that lay dormant at the center that cannot hold. I am the sword, Ayem the star, Seht the mechanism that allows the transformation of the world. Ours is the duty to keep the compromise from being filled with black sea.\n'The Sharmat sleeps at the center. He cannot bear to see it removed, the world of reference. This is the folly of the false dreamer. This is the amnesia of dream, or its power, or its circumvention. This is the weaker magic and it is barbed in venom.\n'This is why I say the secret to swords is the mercy seat. It is my throne. I am become the voice of ALMSIVI. The world will know me more than my sister and brother. I am the psychopomp. I am the killer of the weeds of &lt;a href=\"Veloth\"&gt;Veloth&lt;/a&gt;. Veloth is the center that cannot hold. Ayem is the plot. Seht is the ending. I am the enigma that must be removed. These are why my words are armed to the teeth.\n'The ruling king is to stand against me and then before me. He is to learn from my punishment. I will mark him to know. He is to come as male or female. I am the form he must acquire.\n'Because a ruling king that sees in another his equivalent rules nothing.'\nThis is what was said to the Hortator when Vivec was not whole.\nThe ending of the words is &lt;a href=\"ALMSIVI\"&gt;ALMSIVI&lt;/a&gt;.\nSermon 14.\n&lt;a href=\"Vivec\"&gt;Vivec&lt;/a&gt; lay with &lt;a href=\"Molag%20Bal\"&gt;Molag Bal&lt;/a&gt; for eighty days and eight, though headless. In that time, the &lt;a href=\"Daedric%20Prince\"&gt;Prince&lt;/a&gt; placed the warrior-poet's feet back and filled them with the blood of &lt;a href=\"Daedra\"&gt;Daedra&lt;/a&gt;. In this way Vivec's giant-form remained forever harmless to good earth. The Pomegranate Banquet brought many spirits back from the dead so that the sons and daughters of the union had much to eat besides fruit.\nThe Duke of Scamps came while the banquet was still underway, and Molag Bal looked on the seven pennants with anger. The King of Rape had become necessary and therefore troubled for the rest of time. His legions and Kh-Utta's fell into open war, but the children of Molag Bal and Vivec were too elaborate in power and form.\nThe Duke of Scamps therefore became a lesser thing, as did all his own children. Molag Bal said to them: 'You are the sons of liars, dogs, and wolf-headed women.' They have been useless to summon ever since.\nThe holy one returned at last, Vehk, golden with wisdom. His head found its body had been tenderly used. He mentioned this to Molag Bal, who told him that he should thank the Barons of Move Like This, 'For I have yet to learn how to refine my rapture. My love is accidentally shaped like a spear.'\nSo Vivec, who had a grain of Ayem's mercy, set about to teach Molag Bal in the ways of belly-magic. They took their spears out and compared them. Vivec bit new words onto the King of Rape's so that it might give more than ruin to the uninitiated. This has since become a forbidden ritual, though people still practice it in secret.\nHere is why: The &lt;a href=\"Chimer\"&gt;Velothi&lt;/a&gt; and demons and monsters that were watching all took out their own spears. There was much biting and the earth became wet. And this was the last laugh of Molag Bal:\nWatch as the earth shall crack, heavy with so much power, that should have been forever unalike!'\nThen that stretch of badlands that had been the site of the marriage fragmented and threw fire. And a race that is no more but that was terrible at the time to behold came forth. Born of the biters, that is all they did, and they ran amok across the lands of Veloth and even to the shores of Red Mountain.\nBut Vivec made of his spear a more terrible thing, from a secret he had bitten off from the King of Rape. And so he sent Molag Bal tumbling into the crack of the biters and swore forever that he would not deem the King beautiful ever again.\nVivec wept as he slew all those around him with his terrible new spear. He named it &lt;a href=\"Muatra\"&gt;MUATRA&lt;/a&gt;, which is Milk Taker, and even the &lt;a href=\"Chimer\"&gt;Chimer&lt;/a&gt;i mystics knew his fury. Anyone struck by Vivec at this time turned barren and withered into bone shapes. The path of bones became a sentence for the stars to read, and the heavens have never known children since. Vivec hunted down the biters one by one, and all their progeny, and he killed them all by means of the Nine Apertures, and the wise still hide theirs from Muatra.\nThe ending of the words is &lt;a href=\"ALMSIVI\"&gt;ALMSIVI&lt;/a&gt;.\nSermon 15.\nThese were the days of &lt;a href=\"Resdayn\"&gt;Resdayn&lt;/a&gt;ia, when &lt;a href=\"Chimer\"&gt;Chimer&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Dwemer\"&gt;Dwemer&lt;/a&gt; lived under the wise and benevolent rule of the &lt;a href=\"ALMSIVI\"&gt;ALMSIVI&lt;/a&gt; their champion the &lt;a href=\"Hortator\"&gt;Hortator&lt;/a&gt;. When the gods of &lt;a href=\"Veloth\"&gt;Veloth&lt;/a&gt; would retreat unto their own, to mold the cosmos and other matters, the Hortator would at times become confused. Vivec would always be there to advise him, and this is the third of the three lessons of ruling kings:\n'The ruling king will remove me, his maker. This is the way of all children. His greatest enemy is the Sharmat, who is the false dreamer. You or he is the shingle, Hortator. Beware the wrong walking path. Beware the crime of benevolence. Behold him by his words.'\nI AM THE SHARMAT\nI AM OLDER THAN MUSIC\nWHAT I BRING IS LIGHT\nWHAT I BRING IS A STAR\nWHAT I BRING IS\nAN ANCIENT SEA\nWHEN YOU SLEEP YOU SEE ME\nDANCING AT THE CORE\nIT IS NOT A BLIGHT\nIT IS MY HOUSE\nI PUT A STAR\nINTO THE WORLD'S MOUTH\nTO MURDER IT\nTEAR DOWN THE PYLONS\nMY BLIND FISH\nSWIM IN THE NEW\nPHLOGISTON\nTEAR DOWN THE PYLONS\nMY DEAF MOONS\nSING AND BURN\nAND ORBIT ME\nI AM OLDER THAN MUSIC\nWHAT I BRING IS LIGHT\nWHAT I BRING IS A STAR\nWHAT I BRING IS\nAN ANCIENT SEA\n'You alone, though you come again and again, can unmake him. Whether I allow it is within my wisdom. Go unarmed into his den with these words of power: AE GHARTOK &lt;a href=\"Padomay\"&gt;PADHOME&lt;/a&gt; [&lt;a href=\"Chimer\"&gt;CHIM&lt;/a&gt;] AE ALTADOON. Or do not. The temporal myth is man. Reach heaven by violence. This magic I give to you: the world you will rule is only an intermittent hope and you must be the letter written in uncertainty.'\nThe ending of the words is &lt;a href=\"ALMSIVI\"&gt;ALMSIVI&lt;/a&gt;.\nSermon 16.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Hortator\"&gt;Hortator&lt;/a&gt; wandered through the &lt;a href=\"Mournhold\"&gt;Mourning Hold&lt;/a&gt;, wrestling with the lessons he had learned. They were slippery in his mind. He could not always keep the words straight and knew that this was a danger. He wandered to find Vivec, his lord and master, the glory of the image of &lt;a href=\"Veloth\"&gt;Veloth&lt;/a&gt;, and found him of all places in the Temple of False Thinking. There, clockwork shears were taking off &lt;a href=\"Vivec\"&gt;Vivec&lt;/a&gt;'s hair. A beggar king had brought his loom and was making of the hair an incomplete map of adulthood and death.\n&lt;a href=\"Nerevar\"&gt;Nerevar&lt;/a&gt; said, \"Why are you doing this, milord?\"\n\"Vivec said, \"To make room for the fire.\"\nAnd the &lt;a href=\"Hortator\"&gt;Hortator&lt;/a&gt; could see that Vivec was out of sorts, though not because of the impending new power to come. The golden warrior-poet had been exercising his Water Face as well, learned from the &lt;a href=\"Dreugh%20%28Morrowind%29\"&gt;dreughs&lt;/a&gt; before he was born.\nNerevar said, \"Is this to keep you from the fire?\"\nVivec said, \"It is so that I may see with truth. It, and my place here at the altar of &lt;a href=\"Padomay\"&gt;Padhome&lt;/a&gt; in the house of False Thinking, serve so that I may see beyond my own secrets. The Water Face cannot lie. It comes from the ocean, which is too busy to think, much less lie. Moving water resembles truth by its trembling.\"\nNerevar said, \"I am afraid to become slipshod in my thinking.\"\nVivec said, \"Reach heaven by violence then.\"\nSo to quiet his mind the Hortator chose from the Fight Racks an &lt;a href=\"Axes%20%28Morrowind%29\"&gt;axe&lt;/a&gt;. He named it and moved on to the first moon.\nThere, Nerevar was greeted by the Parliament of Craters, who knew him by title and resented his presence, for he was to be a ruling king of earth and this was the lunar realm. They shifted around him in a pattern of entrapment.\n\"The moon does not recognize crowns or scepters,\" they said, \"nor the representatives of kingdoms below, lion or &lt;a href=\"Tsaesci\"&gt;serpent&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"Dwemer\"&gt;mathematician&lt;/a&gt;. We are the graves of those that have migrated and become ancient countries. We seek no Queens or thrones. Your appearance is decidedly solar, which is to say a library of stolen ideas. We are neither tear nor sorrow. Our revolution succeeded in the manner that is was written. You are the Hortator and unwelcome here.\"\nAnd so Nerevar carved at the grave ghosts until he was out of breath and their Parliament could make no new laws.\nHe said, \"I am not of the slaves that perish.\"\nOf the members of Parliament only a few survived the Hortator's attack.\nA surviving Crater said, \"Appropriation is nothing new. Everything happens of itself. This motif is by no means unassociated with hero myths. You have not acted with the creative impulse; you fall below the weight of destiny. We are graves but not coffins. Know the difference. You have only dug more and supplied no ghosts to reside within. Central to your claim is the predominance of frail events. To be judged by the earth is to sit on a throne of wonder why. Damage us more and you will find naught but the absence of our dead.\"\nThe ending of the words is &lt;a href=\"ALMSIVI\"&gt;ALMSIVI&lt;/a&gt;.\nSermon 17.\n'I am an atlas of smoke.'\nWith this, &lt;a href=\"Vivec\"&gt;Vivec&lt;/a&gt; become greater than he had been. These were the days of &lt;a href=\"Resdayn\"&gt;Resdayn&lt;/a&gt;ia, when &lt;a href=\"Chimer\"&gt;Chimer&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Dwemer\"&gt;Dwemer&lt;/a&gt; lived under the wise and benevolent rule of the and their champion the Hortator.\n'Seek me without effort for I take many shapes.'\nThe &lt;a href=\"Hortator\"&gt;Hortator&lt;/a&gt; was still trying to subdue the heavens with an &lt;a href=\"Axes%20%28Morrowind%29\"&gt;axe&lt;/a&gt;. He was thrown out of the library of the sun by the power of &lt;a href=\"Magnus\"&gt;Magnus&lt;/a&gt;. Vivec found him in a grub field outside of the swamps of the &lt;a href=\"Deshaan%20Plain\"&gt;Deshaan Plain&lt;/a&gt;. They walked for a span in silence, for Nerevar had been humbled and Vivec still had mercy in his hand.\nSoon they were walking across the eastern sea to the land of snakes and snow demons. Vivec wanted to show the Hortator the fighting styles of foreign tongues. They learned the idiom stroke from the pillow book of the &lt;a href=\"Tsaesci\"&gt;Tsaesci&lt;/a&gt; king. It is shaped like the insight of this page. The Tsaesci serpents vowed to have their vengeance on the west &lt;a href=\"Akaviri%20Invasions\"&gt;at least three times&lt;/a&gt;.\nThey walked farther and saw the spiked waters at the edge of the map. Here the spirit of limitation gifted them with a spoke and bade them find the rest of the wheel.\nThe Hortator said, 'The edge of the world is made of swords.'\nVivec corrected him. 'They are the bottom row of the world's teeth.'\nThey walked to the north to the &lt;a href=\"Atmora\"&gt;Elder Wood&lt;/a&gt; and found nothing but frozen bearded kings.\nThey came to the &lt;a href=\"Hammerfell\"&gt;west&lt;/a&gt; where the &lt;a href=\"Redguard\"&gt;black men&lt;/a&gt; dwelt. For a year they studied under their &lt;a href=\"Sword-Singers\"&gt;sword saints&lt;/a&gt; and then for another Vivec taught them the virtue of the little reward. Vivec chose a king for a wife and made another race of monsters which ended up destroying the west completely. To a warrior chief Vivec said:\n'We must not act and speak as if asleep.'\nNerevar wondered if there was anything to learn in the south but Vivec remained silent and only led them back to &lt;a href=\"Red%20Mountain\"&gt;Red Mountain&lt;/a&gt;.\n'Here,' Vivec said, 'is the last of the last. Within it the Sharmat waits.'\nBut they both knew that the time was not ready to contest the Sharmat and so they engaged in combat with each other. Vivec marked the Hortator in this way for all of the &lt;a href=\"Veloth\"&gt;Veloth&lt;/a&gt;i to see. He sealed the wound with the blessing of &lt;a href=\"Ayem\"&gt;Ayem&lt;/a&gt;-&lt;a href=\"Azura\"&gt;Azura&lt;/a&gt;. At the end of the battle, the Hortator found that he had gathered seven more spokes. He attempted to attach them and form a &lt;a href=\"Staff%20of%20Chaos\"&gt;staff&lt;/a&gt; but Vivec would not let him, saying, 'It is not the time for that.'\nNerevar said, 'Where did I find these?'\nVivec said that they had collected them from around the world, though some had come invisibly. 'I am the wheel,' he said, and took that shape. Before the emptiness at the center could live too long, Nerevar put in the spokes.\nThe ending of the words is &lt;a href=\"ALMSIVI\"&gt;ALMSIVI&lt;/a&gt;.\nSermon 18.\nNow &lt;a href=\"Vivec\"&gt;Vivec&lt;/a&gt; felt that he had taught the Horator as much as he could before the war with the &lt;a href=\"Dwemer\"&gt;Dwemer&lt;/a&gt; came. The warrior-poet decided he had to begin his Book of Hours at that point, because the world was about to bend with its age.\nVivec entered the Mourning Hold and announced to Ayem that he was going to fight nine monsters that had escaped the &lt;a href=\"Muatra\"&gt;Muatra&lt;/a&gt;.\nAyem said, 'Out of nine you will find only eight, though they be mighty. The last is already destroyed by your decision to create the Book of Hours.'\nVivec understood that Ayem meant himself.\nVivec knew that his doubt made him the sword of the Triune and so he did not feel shame or fear. Instead, he explained and these are the words:\nThis is what was said to Ayem when Vivec was whole. The wise shall not mistake this.\nAyem said, 'This is why you were born of a netchiman's wife and destined to merge with the simulacrum of your mother, gilled and blended in all the arts of the star-wounded East, under water and in fire and in metal and in ash, six times the wise, to became the union of male and female, the magic &lt;a href=\"hermaphrodite\"&gt;hermaphrodite&lt;/a&gt;, the martial axiom, the sex-death of language and unique in all the middle world.'\nVivec knew then why he would record his Book of Hours.\nThis sermon is forbidden.\nIn this world and others EIGHTEEN less one (the victor) is the magical disk, hurled to reach heaven by violence.\nThis sermon is untrue.\nThe ending of the world is &lt;a href=\"ALMSIVI\"&gt;ALMSIVI&lt;/a&gt;.\nSermon 19.\n&lt;a href=\"Vivec\"&gt;Vivec&lt;/a&gt; put on his armor and stepped into a non-spatial space filling to capacity with mortal interaction and information, a canvas-less cartography of every single mind it has ever known, an event that had developed some semblance of a divine spark. He said, 'From here I shall launch my attack on the eight monsters.'\nVivec then saw the &lt;a href=\"Ancestor%20Moth\"&gt;moths&lt;/a&gt; that would come from the starry heart, bringing with them dust more horrible than the ash of &lt;a href=\"Red%20Mountain\"&gt;Red Mountain&lt;/a&gt;. He saw the twin head of a ruling king who had no equivalent. And eight imperfections rubbed into precious stones, set into a crown that looked like shackles, which he understood to be the twin crowns of the two-headed king. And a river that fed into the mouth of the two-headed king, because he contained multitudes.\nVivec then built the Provisional House at the Center of the Secret Door. From here he could watch the age to come. Of the &lt;a href=\"House%20of%20Troubles\"&gt;House&lt;/a&gt; is written:\nCornerstone one has a fingerBuried under, pointing throughDirt, slow low in the groundNorth cannot be guessed,And yet it is spirit-free\nCornerstone two has a tongue,And even dust can be talkative,Listen and you will see the loveThe ancient libraries need\nCornerstone three has a bit of string,Shaped like your favorite color,A girl remembers who left it thereBut she is afraid to dig it out,And see what it is attached to\nCornerstone four has nine bones,Removed carefully from a black cat,Arranged in the fashion of this word,Protecting us from our enemies\nYour house is safe now\nSo why is it--\nYour house is safe now\nSo why is it--\nThe ending of the words is &lt;a href=\"ALMSIVI\"&gt;ALMSIVI&lt;/a&gt;.\nSermon 20.\nThe first monster was actually two, having been born twice like his mother-father, &lt;a href=\"Vivec\"&gt;Vivec&lt;/a&gt;. He was not the mightiest of the eight to escape &lt;a href=\"Muatra\"&gt;Muatra&lt;/a&gt;, but his actions were the most worrisome. He was known as Moon Axle, and he harvested the leftovers foibles of nature. This he did twice, as was said, and the second harvest always brought ruin or unwritten law. His aspect was faceted like a polyhedron.\nNo perils are mentioned in the finding of Moon Axle, but it was known that he was immune to spears, so Vivec had to use the sword not held against him. Before he took issue with the monster, the warrior-poet asked:\n'How came you to be immune to spears?'\nTo which Moon Axle replied, 'Mine is a dual nature, and protean. I am in fact made of many straight lines, though none last too long. In this way I have learned to ignore all true segments.'\nLuckily, the sword not held was curved and therefore could cut into Moon Axle, and before the sun was up he was bleeding from many wounds. Vivec did not slay him outright for to do so would keep the foibles of nature within him and not back where they belonged. Soon Vivec had traced geography right again, and Moon Axle was ready to be slain.\nVivec rose up in his giant-form, to be terrible to look upon. He reached into the west and pulled out a canyon, holding it like a horn. He reached east and ate a handful of &lt;a href=\"Nix-Hound%20%28Morrowind%29\"&gt;nix hounds&lt;/a&gt;. Blowing their spirits through the canyon made a terrible wail, not unlike an unsolved woman. He said:\n'Let this overtake you,' and Moon Axle was overtaken by the curvatures of stolen souls. They wrapped about the monster like resin, until finally he could not move, nor could his dual nature.\nVivec said, 'Now you are solved,' and pierced his child with Muatra. Moon Axle had been reduced to something static, and therefore shattered.\nThe lines of Moon Axle were collected by &lt;a href=\"Veloth\"&gt;Veloth&lt;/a&gt;i philosophers and taken into caves. There, and for a year, Vivec taught the philosophers how to turn the lines of his son into the spokes of mystery wheels. This was the birth of the first Whirling School. Before, there had only been the surface thought of fire.\nVivec looked at his first wheeling students and observed:\n'Alike the egg-layered universe is this morbid possession of three-distant coverage, soul-wrecked and alive, like my name is alive. In this cloister you have discovered one walking path, hilled like a sword but more coarsened. So edged it is that it has to be whispered to keep the tongue from bleeding, where its signs evacuate their former meanings, like empires that tarry too long.\n'The sword is estrangement from statesmanship.\n'Look on the estimable lines of my son, now crafted star-wise, his every limb equidistant from the center. Is he solved because I will it so? There cannot be a second stage. Think on the theory that my existence promulgates the five elements and alike the egg-layered universe I am cause for great density. Here is a thought that can break the wagon's axle; here is another that can soar.'\nThe ending of the words is &lt;a href=\"ALMSIVI\"&gt;ALMSIVI&lt;/a&gt;.\nSermon 21.\nThe Scripture of the Wheel, First:\nThe Spokes are the eight components of chaos, as yet solidified by the law of time: static change, if you will, something the lizard gods refer to as the Striking. That is the reptile wheel, coiled potential, ever-preamble to the never-action.\nSecond:\nThey are the lent bones of the &lt;a href=\"Aedra\"&gt;Aedra&lt;/a&gt;, the Eight gift-limbs to &lt;a href=\"SITHISIT\"&gt;SITHISIT&lt;/a&gt;, the wet earth of the new star our home. Outside them is the &lt;a href=\"Aurbis\"&gt;Aurbis&lt;/a&gt;, and not within. Like most things inexplicable, it is a circle. Circles are confused serpents, striking and striking and never given leave to bite. The Aedra would have you believe different, but they were givers before liars. Lies have turned them into biters. Their teeth are the proselytizers; to convert is to place oneself in the mouth of falsehood; even to propitiate is to be swallowed.\nThird:\nThe enlightened are those uneaten by the world.\nFourth:\nThe spaces between the gift-limbs number sixteen, the signal shapes of the &lt;a href=\"Daedric%20Princes\"&gt;Demon Princedoms&lt;/a&gt;. It is the key and the lock, series and manticore.\nFifth:\nLook at the majesty sideways and all you see is the Tower, which our ancestors made idols from. Look at its center and all you see is the begotten hole, second serpent, womb-ready for the Right Reaching, exact and without enchantment.\nSixth:\nThe &lt;a href=\"Heart%20of%20Lorkhan\"&gt;heart&lt;/a&gt; of the second serpent holds the secret triangular gate.\nSeventh:\nLook at the secret triangular gate sideways and you see the secret Tower.\nEighth:\nThe secret Tower within the Tower is the shape of the only name of God, I.\nThe ending of the words is &lt;a href=\"ALMSIVI\"&gt;ALMSIVI&lt;/a&gt;.\nSermon 22.\nThen &lt;a href=\"Vivec\"&gt;Vivec&lt;/a&gt; left the first Whirling School and went back to the space that was not a space. From the Provisional House he looked into the middle world to find the second monster, which was called the &lt;a href=\"Muatra%23The%20Treasure%20Wood%20Sword\"&gt;Treasure Wood Sword&lt;/a&gt;. Within years of the Pomegranate Banquet, it had become a lessoning tune to the lower &lt;a href=\"Veloth\"&gt;Veloth&lt;/a&gt;i houses. They preached of its power:\n'The Treasure Wood Sword, splinter scintilla of the high and glorious! He who wields it becomes self-known!'\nThe warrior-poet appeared as a visitation in the ancestor alcove of House Mora, whose rose-worn prince of garlands was a hero against the northern demons. Vivec congregated with the bones. He said:\n'A scavenger cannot acquire a silk sash and expect to discover the greater systems of its predecessor: perfect happiness is embraced only by the weeping. Give me back (and do so freely) what is barren of my marriage and I will not erase you from the thought realm of God. Your line has a notable enchantress that my sister Ayem is fond of and from her murky wisdom alone do I condescend to ask.'\nA &lt;a href=\"Bonewalker\"&gt;bone-walker&lt;/a&gt; emerged from a wall. It had three precious stones set in its lower jaw, a magical practice of old. One was opal, the color of opal. The bone-walker bowed to the prince of the middle air and said:\n'The Treasure Wood Sword will not leave our house. Bargains were made with the Black Hands &lt;a href=\"Mephala\"&gt;Mephala&lt;/a&gt;, the greater shade.'\nVivec kissed the first precious stone and said:\n'Animal picture, rude-walker, go back to the lamp that stays lit in water and store no more messages of useless noise. Down.'\nHe kissed the second precious stone and said:\n'Proud residue, soon dispersed, serve no guarantees made in my fore-image and demand nothing of its under-skin. I am master evermore. Down.'\nHe kissed the opal and said:\n'Down I take thee.'\nAnd then Vivec withdrew into the hidden places and found the darkest mothers of the &lt;a href=\"Morag%20Tong\"&gt;Morag Tong&lt;/a&gt;, taking them all to wife and filling them with undusted loyalty that tasted of summer salt. They became as black queens, screaming live with a hundred murderous sons, a thousand murderous arms, and a hundred thousand murderous hands, one vast moving event of thrusting-kill-laughter in alleys, palaces, workshops, cities and secret halls. Their movements among the holdings of the &lt;a href=\"Ra%27athim\"&gt;Ra'athim&lt;/a&gt; were as rippled endings, heaving between times, with all fates leading to swallowed knives, murder as moaning, God's holy rape-erasure of wet death.\nThe King of Assassins presented to Vivec the Treasure Wood Sword.\n'Milord,' the King of Assassins said. 'The prince of House Mora is now fond of you, as well. I placed him in the &lt;a href=\"Four%20Corners\"&gt;Corner&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"Mehrunes%20Dagon\"&gt;Dagon&lt;/a&gt;. His eyes I set into a fire prayer for the wicked. His mouth I stuffed with birds.'\nThe ending of the words is &lt;a href=\"ALMSIVI\"&gt;ALMSIVI&lt;/a&gt;.\nSermon 23.\nThe Scripture of the Sword, First:\n'The sword, treated as a delicate meal, is the Symbolic Collage. It serves you well in the first half of life. Name one dynasty that knows this not.'\nSecond:\n'The unity of my approach is understood by the immobile warrior. True eyes are acquired. Rejoice as my own subjects and realms. I build for you a city of swords, by which I mean laws that cut the people who live there into better shapes.'\nThird:\n'Girls burn their dresses on my arrival if I am armored. They crawl to me as bled pilgrims. Minor spirits die without trace. Follow me of all the ALMSIVI if you are to mark your days with killing. AE ALTADOON, the third law of weaponry.'\nFourth:\n'The immobile warrior is never fatigued. He cuts sleep holes in the middle of a battle to regain his strength.'\nFifth:\n'Instinct is not reflex action, but mini-miracles held in reserve. I am the welfare that decides which warrior will emerge. Beg not for luck. Serve me to win.'\nSixth:\n'The span of the apparently inactivated is your love of the absolute. The birth of God from the netchiman's wife is the abortion of kindness from love.'\nSeventh:\n'The true sword is able to cut chains of generations, which is to say, the creation myths of your enemies. Look on me as the exiled garden. All else is uncut weed.'\nEighth:\n'I give you an ancient road tempered by the second walking way. Your hands must be huge to wield any sword the size of an ancient road, and yet he who is of right stature may irritate the sun with only a stick.'\nThe ending of the words is &lt;a href=\"ALMSIVI\"&gt;ALMSIVI&lt;/a&gt;.\nSermon 24.\nThen &lt;a href=\"Vivec\"&gt;Vivec&lt;/a&gt; left the house of assassins and went back to the space that was not a space. From the Provisional House he looked into the middle world to find the third monster, called &lt;a href=\"Red%20Mountain\"&gt;Horde Mountain&lt;/a&gt;. It was made of modular warriors running free but spaced according to pattern, and from the highest warrior who could cut clouds they spread out beneath him like a tree, a skirt whose bottom circle was an army that ran through the ash.\nVivec admired the cone-shape of his child and remembered with joy the whirlwind of fighting styles that instructed him during the days before life.\nVivec moved into &lt;a href=\"Veloth\"&gt;Veloth&lt;/a&gt;, saying, 'Onus.'\nBut before he could even get within sword-span of the monster, a trio of lower houses had trapped Horde Mountain in a net of doubtful doctrine. When they saw their lord, the Velothi cheered.\n'We are happy to serve you and win!' they said.\nVivec smiled at those brave souls around him and summoned celebration demons to cleave unto the victors. There was a great display of love and duty around the netted monster, and Vivec was at the center with a headdress made of mating bones. He laughed and told mystical jokes and made the heads of the three houses marry and become a new order.\n'You shall forever be now my &lt;a href=\"Buoyant%20Armigers%20%28Morrowind%29\"&gt;Buoyant Armigers&lt;/a&gt;,' he said.\nThen Vivec pierced Horde Mountain with Muatra and made of it all a big bag of bones. At the touch of his right hand the net became right scripture and he threw it all northeasterly. The contents spread out like sugar-glows and Vivec and the Buoyant Armigers ran under it laughing.\nFinally the bones of Horde Mountain landed and became the foundation stones for the City of Swords, which Vivec named after his own sigil, and the net fell across it all and between, or became as bridges between bones, and since its segments had been touched by his holy wisdom they became the most perfect of all city streets in the known worlds.\nThrongs of Velothi came to the new city and &lt;a href=\"Ayem\"&gt;Ayem&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Seht\"&gt;Seht&lt;/a&gt; gave it their blessing. The streets were filled with laughter and love and the strength of tree-shaped enemy children.\nAyem said:\n'To my sister-brother's city I give the holy protection of &lt;a href=\"House%20Indoril\"&gt;House Indoril&lt;/a&gt;, whose powers and thrones know no equal under heaven, wherefrom came the &lt;a href=\"Hortator\"&gt;Hortator&lt;/a&gt;.'\nSeht said:\n'To my sister-brother's city I give safe passage through the dark corners still left of Molag Bal, and I give it this spell as well: &lt;a href=\"Sotha%20Sil\"&gt;SO-T-HA SIL&lt;/a&gt;, which is my name to the mighty. It will protect the lost unless their flight is on purpose and fill all the roads and alleys with the mystery paths of civilization, and give the city a mind and make of it a conduit to the full concentrate of the ALMSIVI.'\nThus was founded the city of Vivec in the days of &lt;a href=\"Resdayn\"&gt;Resdayn&lt;/a&gt;ia.\nThe ending of the words is &lt;a href=\"ALMSIVI\"&gt;ALMSIVI&lt;/a&gt;.\nSermon 25.\nThe Scripture of the City:\n'All cities are born of solid light. Such is my city, his city.\n'But then the light subsides, revealing the bright and terrible angel of &lt;a href=\"Veloth\"&gt;Veloth&lt;/a&gt;. He is in his pre-chimerical form, demonic VEHK, gaunt and pale and beautiful, skin stretched painfully thin on bird's bones, feathered serpents encircling his arms. His wings are spread out behind him, their red and yellow ends like razors in the sun. The wispy mass of his fire hair floats as if underwater, milky in the nimbus of light that crowns his head. His presence is undeniable, the awe too much to bear.\n'This is God's city, different from others. Cities from foreign countries put their denizens to sleep and walk to the star-wounded East to pay homage to me. The capital of the northern men, crusty with eon's ice, bows before &lt;a href=\"Vivec%20City%20%28Morrowind%29\"&gt;Vivec the city&lt;/a&gt;, me it together.\n'Self-thought streets rush through tunnel blood. I have rebuilt myself. Hyper eyed signposts along my traffic arm, soon to be an inner sea. My body is crawling with all gathered to see me rising up like a monolithic instrument of pleasure. My spine is the main road to the city that I am. Countless transactions are taking place in veins and catwalks and the roaming, roaming, roaming, as they roam over and through and add to me. There are temples erected along the hollow of my skull and I will ever wear them as a crown. Walk across the lips of God.\n'They add new doors to me and I become effortlessly trans-immortal with the comings and goings and the stride-heat of the market where I am traded for, yell of the children hear them play, scoffed at, amused, desired, paid for in native coin, new minted with my face on one side and my city-body on the other. I stare with each new window. Soon I am a million-eyed insect dreaming.\n'Red-sparking war trumpets sound like cattle in the ribcage of shuffling transit. The heretics are destroyed on the plaza knees. I flood over into the hills, houses rising like a rash, and I never scratch. Cities are the antidotes to hunting.\n'I raise lanterns to light my hollows, lend wax to the thousands the candlesticks that bear my name again and again, the name innumerable, shutting in, mantra and priest, god-city, filling every corner with the naming name, wheeled, circling, running river language giggling with footfalls mating, selling, stealing, searching, and worry not ye who walk with me. This is the flowering scheme of the &lt;a href=\"Aurbis\"&gt;Aurbis&lt;/a&gt;. This is the promise of the : egg, image, man, god, city, state. I serve and am served. I am made of wire and string and mortar and I accede my own precedent, world without am.'\nThe ending of the words is &lt;a href=\"ALMSIVI\"&gt;ALMSIVI&lt;/a&gt;.\nSermon 26.\nThen &lt;a href=\"Vivec\"&gt;Vivec&lt;/a&gt; left his architectural rapture and went back to the space that was not a space. From the Provisional House he looked into the middle world to find the fourth monster, called The Pocket Cabal.\nThe monster hid itself in the spell-lists of the great &lt;a href=\"Chimer\"&gt;Chimer&lt;/a&gt;i wizards of the extreme east, where the &lt;a href=\"Emperor%20Parasol\"&gt;Emperor Parasol&lt;/a&gt;s grow wild. Vivec disguised himself as a simple traveler, but radiated a tenuous sense-fabric so that the wizards would seek him out. Of Muatra he made a simple walking dwarf.\nBefore long the invisible one was among the libraries of the east, feeding the essential words of The Pocket Cabal to his walking dwarf and then running when the magic would fail. After a year or two of this thievery, Muatra was sick to its stomach, and the walking dwarf exploded near the slave pens of a wizard's tower. The Pocket Cabal then slipped itself into the mouths of the slaves and hid again.\nVivec then watched as the slaves erupted into babble and breaking magic. They rattled their cages and sung out half-hymns that formed into forbidden and arcane knowledge. Litany fiends appeared and drank from the excess. Grabbers from the Adjacent Place came into the world sideways, the slave talking having disrupted the normal non-cardinal points.\nSo of course a giant bug appeared, with the greatest eastern wizard inside it. He could see past Vivec's disguise and knew of the warrior-poet's divinity but he thought himself so powerful that he talked harshly:\n'See what you have wrought, silly &lt;a href=\"Tribunal\"&gt;Triune&lt;/a&gt;! Columns of nonsense and litany fiends! I cannot believe how reason or temperance can be made whole again due to your eating, eating, eating! &lt;a href=\"36%20Lessons%20of%20Vivec%2C%20Sermon%2012\"&gt;Consort with more demons&lt;/a&gt;, why don't you?'\nVivec stabbed the wizard through his soul.\nThe giant bug harness fell on the slave cages and the slaves ran about free and reckless, too reckless more with pregnant words. Colors bent into the earth. Vivec created a dome-head demon to contain it all.\n'The Pocket Cabal is therefore interred here forever. Let this be a cursed land where sorcery is broken and maligned.'\nThen he picked up &lt;a href=\"Muatra\"&gt;Muatra&lt;/a&gt; by the beard and left the ghostly hemisphere of the dome-head demon. On its boundaries, Vivec placed a warning and a song of entrance that contained errors in it. With mock bones of half-dead Muatra he created the tent poles of a fortress-theory and fatal languages were imprisoned for all time.\nSeht appeared and looked on what his brother-sister had created. The &lt;a href=\"Clockwork%20City%20%28Tribunal%29\"&gt;Clockwork King&lt;/a&gt; said:\n'Of the eight monsters, this is the most confusing. May I treasure it?'\nVivec gave Seht leave to do so, but told him never to release The Pocket Cabal into the middle world. He said:\n'I have hidden secrets in my travels here and made a likeness of Muatra to ward against the unwise. Under this dome, the temporal myth is no longer man.'\nThe ending of the words is &lt;a href=\"ALMSIVI\"&gt;ALMSIVI&lt;/a&gt;.\nSermon 27.\nThe Scripture of the Word, First:\n'All language is based on meat. Do not let the sophists fool you.'\nSecond:\n'The third walking path explores hysteria without fear. The efforts of madmen are a society of itself, but only if they are written. The wise may substitute one law for another, even into incoherence, and still say he is working within a method. This is true of speech and extends to all scripture.'\nThird:\n'Do not go to the realm of apology for absolution. Beyond articulation, there is no fault. The Adjacent Place, where the Grabbers live, is the illusion of the vocal or the middle realms of thought, by which I mean the constructed. This is how I stole the certainty of the Chancellor of Exactitude, perfect to look upon from every angle. When you come out of the vocal, you can never be certain.'\nFourth:\n'The truest body of work is made up of silence: as in the silence that results from no reference. By the word I mean the dead.'\nFifth:\n'The first meaning is always hidden.'\nSixth:\n'The realm of apology is perfection and impossible to attack. Thus, the wise avoid it. Trinity in unity is the world and word of action: the third walking path.'\nSeventh:\n'The sage who suppresses his best aphorism: cut off his hands, for he is a thief.'\nEighth:\n'The clothes of the broken map are worn only by fools and heretics. The map is an exit for laziness. It is the dusty tongue, which is to say the given chart that most take as a story that is complete. &lt;a href=\"Elder%20Scroll%20%28Lore%29\"&gt;No word is true until it is eaten&lt;/a&gt;.'\nThe ending of the words is &lt;a href=\"ALMSIVI\"&gt;ALMSIVI&lt;/a&gt;.\nSermon 28.\nThen &lt;a href=\"Vivec\"&gt;Vivec&lt;/a&gt; left Seht to look after the dome-head demon and went back to the space that was not a space. From the Provisional House he looked into the middle world to find the fifth monster, called The &lt;a href=\"Ruddy%20Man\"&gt;Ruddy Man&lt;/a&gt;.\nWhen the &lt;a href=\"Dreugh%20%28Morrowind%29\"&gt;dreughs&lt;/a&gt; ruled the world, the &lt;a href=\"Daedroth%20%28Morrowind%29\"&gt;Daedroth&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Daedric%20Prince\"&gt;Prince&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Molag%20Bal\"&gt;Molag Bal&lt;/a&gt; had been their chief. He took a different shape then, spiny and armored and made for the sea. Vivec, in giving birth to the many spawn of his marriage, had dropped an old image of Molag Bal into the world: a dead carapace of memory. It would not have been a monster if a &lt;a href=\"Veloth\"&gt;Veloth&lt;/a&gt;i child had not wanted to impress his village by wearing it.\nThe Ruddy Man, of the eight monsters, was the least complicated. He made those who wore him into mighty killers and nothing more. He existed in the physical. Only geography makes him special.\nWhen Vivec found him near the boy's village, anon &lt;a href=\"Gnisis\"&gt;Gnisis&lt;/a&gt;, there was a violent clash of arms and an upheaval of the earth. Their battle created the West Gash. Wanderers that still go there hear still the sounds of it: sword across the crust, the grunt of God, the snapping of his monster child's splintered legs.\nAfter his victory, Vivec took the shell of The Ruddy Man to the dreughs that had modified his mother. The Queen of Dreughs, whose name is not easy to spell, was in a period of self-incubation. Her wardens took the gift from Vivec and promised to guard it from the surface world. This is the first account of dreughs being liars.\nIn ten years, The Ruddy Man appeared again, this time near Tear, worn by a wayward shaman who followed the House of Troubles. Instead of guarding it, the dreughs had imbued the living armor with mythic inflexibility. It molted soon after skill-draping the shaman and stretched his bones to the five corners.\nWhen Vivec met the monster in battle again he saw the remains of three villages dripping from its feet. He took on his giant form and slew The Ruddy Man by way of the Symbolic Collage. Since he no longer trusted the Altmer of the sea, Vivec gave the carapace of the monster to the devout and loyal mystics of the Number Room. He told them:\n'You may make of The Ruddy Man a philosopher's armor.'\nThe mystics began by wrapping one of their sages in the shells, a series of flourishes by two supra numerates, one hormonally tall and the other just under his arms. They ran around the carapace and through each other, applying holy resin drawn from the carcasses of the now-useless numbers between twelve and thirteen. Golden straws were quickly stuck through the mythic epidermal so the sage could breathe. After the ceremonial etchings were drawn into hardening resin, long lists of dead names and equations whose solutions were to be found in the mouth of the &lt;a href=\"Chimer\"&gt;Chimer&lt;/a&gt; inside, there came the illuminations, inscribed by the bright, terrible fingernail of Vivec. From the nail's tip flowed a searing liquid, filling the grooves of the ceremonial etchings. They bled out to form veined patterns about the sage-shell that theologians would decipher forever after.\nThe ending of the words is &lt;a href=\"ALMSIVI\"&gt;ALMSIVI&lt;/a&gt;.\nSermon 29.\nThe Scripture of the Numbers:\n1. &lt;a href=\"Dragon%20Break\"&gt;The Dragon Break&lt;/a&gt;, or &lt;a href=\"The%20Tower%20%28Aurbis%29\"&gt;the Tower&lt;/a&gt;. 1\n2.

To be affixed to a symbol is too, too certain.'\nThe ending of the words is &lt;a href=\"ALMSIVI\"&gt;ALMSIVI&lt;/a&gt;.\nSermon 30.\nThen &lt;a href=\"Vivec\"&gt;Vivec&lt;/a&gt; left the mystics of the Number Room and went back to the space that was not a space. From the Provisional House he looked into the middle world to find the sixth monster, called City-Face. He was vexed when he could not find it and went back to the &lt;a href=\"Mournhold\"&gt;Mourning Hold&lt;/a&gt; in secret anger, killing a mystic that asked about higher order.\n&lt;a href=\"Nerevar\"&gt;Nerevar&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"Hortator\"&gt;Hortator&lt;/a&gt;, witnessed this and said, 'Why do this, milord? The mystics look to you for guidance. They work to make your temple better stoned.'\nVivec said, 'No one knows what I am.'\nThe Hortator nodded and went back to his studies.\nHere is how City-Face hid from his mother-father: it had been born named as Ha-Note, a bare urge of power, an esoteric wind nerve tuned to the frequency of huddled masses. It found root in villages and multiplied, finding in the minds of the settled a veiled astrology, the star charts of culture, and this resonance made its head swim. Ha-Note moved sideways into the Adjacent Place, growing and unbeknownst. Above the vocal, it trembled with new emotions, immortal ones, absorbing more than the thirty known to exist in the middle world. When Ha-Note became gravely homesick, the Grabbers took it.\nA Grabber said, 'New emotions to the lonely occur only of madness. This thing is gone. It is ours now.'\nGrabbers had never made a city of their own, and their glimpse of Vivec's, which shone with holiness through all the spheres, had taken their attention.\n'Under this reason did the issue of Vehk slide into our realm, drawn by our coveting, hidden in loss. We shall build our tower-hope upon its face.'\nNow many years had passed in &lt;a href=\"Resdayn\"&gt;Resdayn&lt;/a&gt;ia, and the high priests of the &lt;a href=\"Dwemer\"&gt;Dwemer&lt;/a&gt; were building something alike as Vivec and alike as the new Ha-Note of the Grabbers. The Hortator was engaged with an army of theirs that had become too brave, talking foolish words, and Nerevar helped destroy them with the help of the orphan legion of Ayem. When he went to give trophy to Vivec, he saw his lord under attack by the City-Face. The monster was saying this:\n'Here we are to replace your city, Vehk and Vehk. We are from the place of the more-than-known emotions, and our citizenry has died from it. Two things we came for, but can stay for only one. Either we ask you to correct our error of culture, or merely take yours by dint of force. The second is easiest, we think.'\nVivec sighed.\n'You would replace my direction,' he said. 'I weary of this, though I wanted to kill you an age before. Resdaynia is fallen ill, and I have no time for one more imaginary analogy of an unknown incident. Here, take this.'\nAt which he touched the tower-hope of the City-Face and corrected the error of the Grabbers.\n'And this.'\nAt which he stabbed the heart of the City-Face with the Ethos Knife, which is to say &lt;a href=\"Arkay\"&gt;RKHT&lt;/a&gt; AI AE ALTADOON AI, the short blade of proper commerce.\nThe ending of the words is &lt;a href=\"ALMSIVI\"&gt;ALMSIVI&lt;/a&gt;.\nSermon 31.\nMany more years passed in &lt;a href=\"Resdayn\"&gt;Resdayn&lt;/a&gt;ia, and the high priests of the &lt;a href=\"Dwemer\"&gt;Dwemer&lt;/a&gt; were almost ready to make war on the rulers of Veloth. The Hortator had become the husband of &lt;a href=\"Ayem\"&gt;Ayem&lt;/a&gt; during this time, and the first saint of the Triune way. Vivec had tired of fighting his sons and daughters, and so took a respite from trying to find them.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Hortator\"&gt;Hortator&lt;/a&gt; said to his wife, 'Where is Vivec, my teacher? I love him still, though he grows cold. His lamentations, if I may call them that, have changed the skin of the whole country. He is hardly to be found anywhere in &lt;a href=\"Veloth\"&gt;Veloth&lt;/a&gt; of late. The people grow dark because of it.'\nAnd Ayem took mercy on her troubled husband and told him that the sword of the &lt;a href=\"Tribunal\"&gt;Triune&lt;/a&gt; had been fighting minor monsters stirred up by the Dwemer as they worked on their brass siege machines. She took the Hortator inside her and showed him where his master was.\nALMSIVI, or at least that aspect that chose to be Vivec, sat in the Litany Hall of the False Thinking Temple after his battle with the Flute-and-Pipe Ogres of the West Gash. He began writing, again, in his Book of Hours. He had to put on his Water Face first. That way he could separate the bronze of the Old Temple from the blue of the New and write with happiness. Second, he had to take another feather from the &lt;a href=\"Jode\"&gt;Big Moon&lt;/a&gt;, further rendering it dead. That way he could write about mortals with truth. Third, he recalled the Pomegranate Banquet, where he was forced to marry to Molag Bal with wet scriptures to cement his likeness as &lt;a href=\"Mephala\"&gt;Mephala&lt;/a&gt; and write with black hands. He wrote:\nThe last time I heard his voice, showing the slightest sign of impatience, I learned to control myself and submit to the will of others. Afterwards, I dared to take on the sacred fire and realized there was no equilibrium with the &lt;a href=\"Et%27Ada\"&gt;ET'ADA&lt;/a&gt;. They were liars, lost roots, and the most I can do is to be an interpreter into the rational. Even that fails the needs of the people. I sit on the mercy seat and pass judgment, the waking state, and the phase aspect of the innate urge. Only here can I doubt, in this book, written in water, broadened to include evil.\nThen Vivec threw his ink on this passage to cover it up (for the lay reader) and wrote instead:\nFind me in the blackened paper, unarmored, in final scenery. Truth is like my husband: instructed to smash, filled with procedure and noise, hammering, weighty, heaviness made schematic, lessons learned only by a mace. Let those that hear me then be buffeted, and let some die in the ash from the striking. Let those that find him find him murdered by illumination, pummeled like a traitorous house, because, if an hour is golden, then immortal I am a secret code. I am the partaker of the Doom Drum, chosen of all those that dwell in the middle world to wear this crown, which reverberates with truth, and I am the mangling messiah.\nhe ending of the words is &lt;a href=\"ALMSIVI\"&gt;ALMSIVI&lt;/a&gt;.\nSermon 32.\nThe Scripture of the Mace, First:\n'The pleasure of annihilation is the pleasure of disappearing into the unreal. All those that would challenge the sleeping world will seek membership in this movement. I denounce the alienation of the Cloven Duality with a hammer.'\nSecond:\n'Take from me the lessons as a punishment for being mortal. To be made of dirt is to be treated as such by your jailers. This is the key and the lock of the &lt;a href=\"Daedra\"&gt;Daedra&lt;/a&gt;. Why do you think they escaped the compromise?'\nThird:\n'&lt;a href=\"Veloth\"&gt;Veloth&lt;/a&gt;i, your skin has become the pregnant darkness. My brooding has brought this on. Remember that &lt;a href=\"Boethiah\"&gt;Boethiah&lt;/a&gt; asked you to become the color of bruise. How else to show yourselves people of the exodus into the vital: pain?'\nFourth:\n'The sage who is not an anvil: a conventional sentence and nothing more. By which I mean dead, the fourth walking way.'\nFifth:\n'A proper comprehension of the virtues: stage-managed and to be murdered.'\nSixth:\n'In the end, rejoice as a hostage released from drumming torment but that savors his wound. The drum breaks and you find it to be a nest of hornets, which is to say: your sleep is over.'\nSeventh:\n'The suspicious is spectacle and the lie is only a theoretical inspiration.'\nEighth:\n'But then why, you ask, do the &lt;a href=\"Daedra\"&gt;Daedra&lt;/a&gt; wish to meddle with the &lt;a href=\"Aurbis\"&gt;Aurbis&lt;/a&gt;? It is because they are the radical critique, essential as all martyrs. That some are more evil than others in not an illusion. Or rather, it is a necessary illusion.'\nThe ending of the words is &lt;a href=\"ALMSIVI\"&gt;ALMSIVI&lt;/a&gt;.\nSermon 33.\nThen &lt;a href=\"Vivec\"&gt;Vivec&lt;/a&gt; left the Litany Hall of the False Thinking Temple, where he had brooded for so long creating the scripture of the pounding light, and went back to the space that was not a space. From the Provisional House he looked into the middle world to find the seventh monster, called Lie Rock.\nLie Rock was born of Vivec's Second Aperture and was thrown out of the Pomegranate Banquet by a member of the Sweeps, another forgotten guild. The Sweep did not take it for the monster that it was and so he did not expect it to fly from his hand and into the heavens.\n'I am born of golden wisdom and powers that should have forever been unalike! With this nature I am invited into the Hidden Heaven!'\nBy which he meant the Scaled Blanket, made of not-stars, whose number is thirteen. Lie Rock became full of foolishness, haggling with the Void Ghost who hides in the religions of all men. The Void Ghost said:\n'Stay with me a full hundred years and I will give you a power that no divinity will dare disobey.'\nBut before the hundred years was up, Vivec was already looking for Lie Rock and found him.\n'Stupid stone,' Vivec said. 'To hide in the Scaled Blanket is to make a mark on nothing. His bargains are only for ruling kings!'\nSo Vivec sent the Hortator to the heavens to shave Lie Rock asunder by the named axe. Nerevar made peace with the south-pole-star of thieving and the north-pole-star of warriors and the third-pole-star, which existed only in the ether, which was governed by the apprentice of &lt;a href=\"Magnus\"&gt;Magnus&lt;/a&gt; the sun. They gave him leave to wander among their charges and gave him red sight by which to find Lie Rock in the Hidden Heaven.\nBy chance, &lt;a href=\"Nerevar\"&gt;Nerevar&lt;/a&gt; met the Void Ghost first, who told him that he was in the wrong place to which the &lt;a href=\"Hortator\"&gt;Hortator&lt;/a&gt; said, 'Me or you?' and the Void Ghost said both. This sermon does not tell what else was said between these masters.\nLie Rock, however, used the confusion to launch his own attack on the city-god, Vivec. He was hastened by all three of the black guardians, who wanted him swiftly gone, though they meant no hostility to the lord of the middle air.\nThe citizenry of Vivec screamed as they saw a shooting star come down out of the sky hole like a toll-road of hell. But Vivec merely raised his hand and froze Lie Rock just above the city and then he pierced the monster with &lt;a href=\"Muatra\"&gt;Muatra&lt;/a&gt;.\nWhen Nerevar returned, he saw the frozen comet above his lord's city. He asked whether or not Vivec wanted it removed.\n'I would have done so myself if I wanted, silly Hortator. I shall keep it there with its last intention intact, so that if the love of the people of this city for me ever disappear, so shall the power that holds back their destruction.'\nNerevar said, 'Love is under your will only.'\nVivec smiled and told the Hortator that he had become a &lt;a href=\"Ministry%20of%20Truth\"&gt;Minister of Truth&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe ending of the words is &lt;a href=\"ALMSIVI\"&gt;ALMSIVI&lt;/a&gt;.\nSermon 34.\nThen &lt;a href=\"Vivec\"&gt;Vivec&lt;/a&gt; left the &lt;a href=\"Ministry%20of%20Truth\"&gt;Ministry of Truth&lt;/a&gt; and went back to the space that was not a space. From the Provisional House he looked into the middle world to find the eighth and final and mightiest monster, called GULGA MOR JIL and more. The wise must look elsewhere for this string of power.\nVivec called to his side the &lt;a href=\"Hortator\"&gt;Hortator&lt;/a&gt; and this was the first time that &lt;a href=\"Nerevar\"&gt;Nerevar&lt;/a&gt; had ever been to the Provisional House. He had the same vision that Vivec had so many years ago: that of the two-headed ruling king.\n'Who is that?' he wondered.\nVivec said, 'The &lt;a href=\"Red%20Diamond\"&gt;red jewel of conquest&lt;/a&gt;.'\nNerevar, perhaps because he was frightened, became vexed at his lord's answer. 'Why are you always so evasive?'\nVivec told the Hortator that to be otherwise was to betray his nature.\nTogether they moved into the middle world, to a village near where Vivec had been found by Ayem and Seht. The eighth monster was there, but he did not act much like a monster. He sat with his legs in the ocean and with a troubled look on his face. When he saw his mother-father, he asked why he should have to die and return to &lt;a href=\"Oblivion%20%28Realm%29\"&gt;Oblivion&lt;/a&gt;.\nVivec told the eighth monster that to be otherwise was to betray his nature. Since this did not seem to satisfy the monster and Vivec still had a touch of Ayem's mercy he said:\n'The fire is mine: let it consume thee,And make a secret doorAt the altar of &lt;a href=\"Padomay\"&gt;Padhome&lt;/a&gt;,In the House of &lt;a href=\"Boethiah\"&gt;Boet-hi-Ah&lt;/a&gt;Where we become safeAnd looked after.'\nThe monster accepted Muatra with a peaceful look and his bones became the foundation for the City of the Dead, anon .\nNerevar put away his axe, which he had at the ready, and frowned.\n'Why,' he said, 'did you ask me to come if you knew the eighth monster would give in so easily?'\nVivec looked at the Hortator for a long time.\nNerevar understood. 'Do not betray your nature. Answer as you will.'\nVivec said, 'I brought you here because I knew the mightiest of my issue would succumb to &lt;a href=\"Muatra\"&gt;Muatra&lt;/a&gt; without argument, if only I gave him consolation first.'\nNerevar looked at Vivec for a long time.\nVivec understood. 'Say the words, Hortator.'\nNerevar said, 'Now I am the mightiest of your children.'\nLet this sermon be consolation to those who read it that are destined to die.\nThe ending of the words is &lt;a href=\"ALMSIVI\"&gt;ALMSIVI&lt;/a&gt;.\nSermon 35.\nThe Scripture of Love:\n'The formulas of proper &lt;a href=\"Veloth\"&gt;Veloth&lt;/a&gt;i magic continue in ancient tradition, but that virility is dead, by which I mean at least replaced. Truth owes its medicinal nature to the establishment of the myth of justice. Its curative properties it likewise owes to the concept of sacrifice. Princes, chiefs, and angels all subscribe to the same notion. This is a view primarily based on a prolific abolition of an implied profanity, seen in ceremonies, knife fighting, hunting, and the exploration of the poetic. On the ritual of occasions, which comes to us from the days of the cave glow, I can say nothing more than to loosen your equation of moods to lunar currency. Later, and by that I mean much, much later, my reign will be seen as an act of the highest love, which is a return from the astral destiny and the marriages between. By that I mean the &lt;a href=\"Elder%20Scroll%20%28Lore%29\"&gt;catastrophes&lt;/a&gt;, which will come from all five corners. Subsequent are the revisions, differentiated between hope and the distraught, situations that are only required by the periodic death of the immutable. Cosmic time is repeated: I wrote of this in an earlier life. An imitation of submersion is love's premonition, its folly into the underworld, by which I mean the day you will read about outside of yourself in an age of gold. For on that day, which is a shadow of the sacrificial concept, all history is obliged to see me for what you are: in love with evil. To keep one's powers intact at such a stage is to allow for the existence of what can only be called a continual spirit. Make of your love a defense against the horizon. Pure existence is only granted to the holy, which comes in a myriad of forms, half of them frightening and the other half divided into equal parts purposeless and assured. Late is the lover that comes to this by any other walking way than the fifth, which is the number of the limit of this world. The lover is the highest country and a series of beliefs. He is the sacred city bereft of a double. The uncultivated land of monsters is the rule. This is clearly attested by &lt;a href=\"Anu\"&gt;ANU&lt;/a&gt; and his double, which love knows never really happened. Similarly, all the other symbols of absolute reality are ancient ideas ready for their graves, or at least the essence of such. This scripture is directly ordered by the codes of &lt;a href=\"Mephala\"&gt;Mephala&lt;/a&gt;, the origin of sex and murder, defeated only by those who take up those ideas without my intervention. The religious elite is not a tendency or a correlation. They are dogma complemented by the influence of the untrustworthy sea and the governance of the stars, dominated at the &lt;a href=\"36%20Lessons%20of%20Vivec%2C%20Sermon%2029\"&gt;center by the sword&lt;/a&gt;, which is nothing without a victim to cleave unto. This is the love of God and he would show you more: predatory but at the same time instrumental to the will of critical harvest, a scenario by which one becomes as he is, of male and female, the magic &lt;a href=\"hermaphrodite\"&gt;hermaphrodite&lt;/a&gt;. Mark the norms of violence and it barely registers, suspended as it is by treaties written between the original spirits. This should be seen as an opportunity, and in no way tedious, though some will give up for it is easier to kiss the lover than become one. The lower regions crawl with these souls, caves of shallow treasures, meeting in places to testify by way of extension, when love is only satisfied by a considerable (incalculable) effort.'\nThe ending of the words is &lt;a href=\"ALMSIVI\"&gt;ALMSIVI&lt;/a&gt;.\nSermon 36.\nFor these were the days of &lt;a href=\"Resdayn\"&gt;Resdayn&lt;/a&gt;ia, when &lt;a href=\"Chimer\"&gt;Chimer&lt;/a&gt; and Dwemer lived under the wise and benevolent rule of the and their champion the Hortator, though the &lt;a href=\"Dwemer\"&gt;Dwemer&lt;/a&gt; had become foolish and challenged their masters.\nOut of their fortresses they came with golden ballistae that walked and mighty &lt;a href=\"atronach\"&gt;atronach&lt;/a&gt;s and things that spat flame and things that made killing songs. Their king was &lt;a href=\"Dumac\"&gt;Dumac&lt;/a&gt; Dwarf-Orc, but their high priest was &lt;a href=\"Kagrenac\"&gt;Kagrenac&lt;/a&gt; the Blighter.\nUnder mountains and over them the war with the Dwemer was raged, and then came the northern men to help Kagrenac and they brought &lt;a href=\"Wulfharth\"&gt;Ysmir&lt;/a&gt; again.\nLeading the armies of the Chimer was the slave that would not perish, the &lt;a href=\"Hortator\"&gt;Hortator&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Nerevar\"&gt;Nerevar&lt;/a&gt;, who had traded his axe for the Ethos Knife. He slew Dumac at &lt;a href=\"Red%20Mountain\"&gt;Red Mountain&lt;/a&gt; and saw the &lt;a href=\"Heart%20of%20Lorkhan\"&gt;heart bone&lt;/a&gt; for the first time.\nMen of brass destroyed the eleven gates of the &lt;a href=\"Mournhold\"&gt;Mourning Hold&lt;/a&gt; and behind them came the Dwemeri architects of tone. &lt;a href=\"Ayem\"&gt;Ayem&lt;/a&gt; threw down her cloak and became the Face-Snaked Queen of the &lt;a href=\"Tribunal\"&gt;Three in One&lt;/a&gt;. Those that looked upon her were overcome by the meanings of the stars.\nUnder the sea, &lt;a href=\"Sotha%20Sil\"&gt;Seht&lt;/a&gt; stirred and brought the army he had been working on in the castles of glass and coral. Clockwork &lt;a href=\"Dreugh%20%28Morrowind%29\"&gt;dreughs&lt;/a&gt;, mockeries of the Dwemeri war machines, rose up from the seas and took their counterparts back beneath, where they were swallowed forever by the sea.\n&lt;a href=\"Red%20Mountain\"&gt;Red Mountain&lt;/a&gt; exploded as the Hortator went too far inside, seeking the &lt;a href=\"Sharmat\"&gt;Sharmat&lt;/a&gt;.\nDwemeri high priest Kagrenac then revealed that which he had built in the image of &lt;a href=\"Vivec\"&gt;Vivec&lt;/a&gt;. It was a &lt;a href=\"Numidium\"&gt;walking star&lt;/a&gt;, which burnt the armies of the Triune and destroyed the heartland of &lt;a href=\"Morrowind\"&gt;Veloth&lt;/a&gt;, creating the &lt;a href=\"Inner%20Sea\"&gt;Inner Sea&lt;/a&gt;.\nEach of the aspects of the ALMSIVI then rose up together, combining as one, and showed the world the sixth path. Ayem took from the star its fire, Seht took from it its mystery, and Vehk took from it its feet, which had been constructed before the gift of &lt;a href=\"Molag%20Bal\"&gt;Molag Bal&lt;/a&gt; and destroyed in the manner of truth: by a great hammering. When the soul of the Dwemer could walk no more, they were removed from this world.\nResdaynia was no more. It had been redeemed of all the iniquities of the foolish. The ALMSIVI drew nets from the Beginning Place and captured the ash of &lt;a href=\"Red%20Mountain\"&gt;Red Mountain&lt;/a&gt;, which they knew was the Blight of the Dwemer and that would serve only to infect the whole of the middle world, and ate it. ALTADOON &lt;a href=\"Dunmer\"&gt;DUNMERI&lt;/a&gt;!\nThe beginning of the words is &lt;a href=\"ALMSIVI\"&gt;ALMSIVI&lt;/a&gt;. I give you this as Vivec.\nSermon 37.\nYou have discovered the thirty-seventh &lt;a href=\"36%20Lessons%20of%20Vivec\"&gt;Sermon&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"Vivec\"&gt;Vivec&lt;/a&gt;, which is a bending of the light, long past the chronicles of the &lt;a href=\"Hortator\"&gt;Hortator&lt;/a&gt; who wore inconstant faces and ruled however they would, until apocalypse.\nVivec was borne by ribbons of water, which wrote their starward couplings in red. This was a new place of speed. His eyes broke on the spikes above the tower, where the Void Ghost squatted over a drake-scaled drum, imbecile in its rhythm. And he asked of it:\n\"Who are you, that need no signature at all?\"\n&lt;a href=\"Tribunal\"&gt;Three in sum&lt;/a&gt;, the robes of &lt;a href=\"Almalexia\"&gt;Ayem&lt;/a&gt; stretched towards the bright black rim of memory, roping an arc of purchase. This was a new sprinting task. And &lt;a href=\"Sotha%20Sil\"&gt;Seht&lt;/a&gt; held his swollen belly to its name, clockmaker's daughter, swimming the dead confession along a century of thread, Naming her, uneaten, a golden cache of Veloth and Velothi, for where else would they know to go?\n\"Go here: \" Seht said, until all of it was done, and in the center was anything whatever.\nAnd the red moment became a great howling unchecked, for the Provisional House was in ruin. And Vivec became as glass, a lamp, for the dragon's mane had broke, and the red moon bade him come.\n\"The sign of royalty is not this,\" a &lt;a href=\"Azura\"&gt;signal blueshift (female)&lt;/a&gt; told him, \"There is no right lesson learned alone.\"\nHe refused the twine on her catching net, spiteful that an uncontinued people would not become fuller by their searching, and yet were wracked in their spirits for flight. But the male signals were offended, and Vivec took a fighting form. He undid his eastern light, saying to the ALMSIVI that through war, they had become brides in glass, which no power could observe.\nThe light bent, and Vivec donned a cuirass made of red plates of jewel, and a mask that marked him born in the lands of Man. Wheeling, he spread into an insect salve, worn on the neck of hist-bulbs when at challenge. He roared up and fed his fingers to mammoth ghosts. The signal fires wondered if they mistook this for surrender, for Vivec had told the void that he could learn to undo it all.\nThe light bent, and somewhere a history was finally undone. Of it, Vivec remembered the laughing of the netchimen of his village when the hunts were good. He marched with his father in the ash, growing strong in the hooks and sail, able to run a junk through silt. At eleven, he sung to an &lt;a href=\"ashkhan\"&gt;ashkhan&lt;/a&gt;. He became sick after &lt;a href=\"Red%20Mountain\"&gt;Red Mountain&lt;/a&gt;, with the nix-blood and fever, and was infirm a hundred years. His mother survived him and laid his body at the altar of &lt;a href=\"Padomay\"&gt;Padhome&lt;/a&gt;. She gave him her skin to wear into the underworld.\nThe light bent, and Vivec awoke and grew fangs, unwilling to make of herself a folding thing. This was a new and lunar promise. And in her Biting she tunneled up and then downward, while her brother and sister smeared across heaven, thin ruptures of dissent, food for scarabs and the Worm. She took her people and made them safe, and sat with Azura drawing her own husband's likeness in the dirt.\n\"For I have removed my left hand and my right, he will say,\" she said, \"for that is how I shall win against them. Love alone and you shall know only mistakes of salt.\"\nThe worlding of the words is AMARANTH."}

Ayem took a netchiman's wife and said:\n'I am the Face-Snaked Queen of the &lt;a href=\"Tribunal\"&gt;Three in One&lt;/a&gt;. In you is an image and a seven-syllable spell, AYEM &lt;a href=\"AE\"&gt;AE&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Sotha%20Sil\"&gt;SEHTI&lt;/a&gt; AE &lt;a href=\"Vivec\"&gt;VEHK&lt;/a&gt;, which you will repeat to it until mystery comes.'\nThen Ayem threw the netchiman's wife into the ocean water where &lt;a href=\"Dreugh%20%28Morrowind%29\"&gt;dreughs&lt;/a&gt; took her into castles of glass and coral. They gifted the netchiman's wife with gills and milk fingers, changing her sex so that she might give birth to the image as an egg. There she stayed for seven or eight months.\nThen Seht came to the netchiman's wife and said:\n'I am the Clockwork King of the Three in One. In you is an egg of my brother-sister, who possesses invisible knowledge of words and swords, which you shall nurture until the &lt;a href=\"Nerevar\"&gt;Hortator&lt;/a&gt; comes.'\nAnd Seht then extended his hands and multitudes of homunculi came forth, each like a glimmering rope through the water, and they raised the netchiman's wife back to the surface world and set her down on the shoals of &lt;a href=\"Azura%27s%20Coast%20%28Morrowind%29\"&gt;Azura's Coast&lt;/a&gt;. There she lay for seven or eight more months, caring for the egg-knowledge by whispering to it the Codes of &lt;a href=\"Mephala\"&gt;Mephala&lt;/a&gt; and the prophecies of Veloth and even the forbidden teachings of &lt;a href=\"Trinimac\"&gt;Trinimac&lt;/a&gt;.\nSeven &lt;a href=\"Daedra\"&gt;Daedra&lt;/a&gt; came to her one night and each one gave to the egg new motions that could be achieved by certain movements of the bones. These are called the Barons of Move Like This. Then an eighth Daedroth came, and he was a &lt;a href=\"Demiprince\"&gt;Demiprince&lt;/a&gt;, called &lt;a href=\"Fa-Nuit-Hen\"&gt;Fa-Nuit-Hen&lt;/a&gt;, or the Multiplier of Motions Known. And Fa-Nuit-Hen said:\n'Whom do you wait for?'\nTo which the netchiman's wife said to the &lt;a href=\"Hortator\"&gt;Hortator&lt;/a&gt;.\n'Go to the land of the &lt;a href=\"House%20Indoril\"&gt;Indoril&lt;/a&gt; in three months' time, for that is when war comes. I return now to haunt the warriors who fell and still wonder why. But first I show you this.'\nThen the Barons and the Demiprince joined together into a pillar of fighting styles terrible to behold and they danced before the egg and its learning image.\n'Look, little Vehk, and find the face behind the splendor of my bladed carriage, for in it is delivered the unmixed conflict path, perfect in every way. What is its number?'\nIt is said the number is the number of birds that can nest in an ancient tibrol tree, less three grams of honest work, but Vivec in his later years found a better one and so gave this secret to his people.\n'For I have crushed a world with my left hand,' he will say, 'but in my right hand is how it could have won against me.

When the gods of &lt;a href=\"Veloth\"&gt;Veloth&lt;/a&gt; would retreat unto their own, to mold the cosmos and other matters, the Hortator would at times become confused. &lt;a href=\"Vivec\"&gt;Vivec&lt;/a&gt; would always be there to advise him, and this is the first of the three lessons of ruling kings:\n\"The waking world is the amnesia of dream. All motifs can be mortally wounded. Once slain, themes turn into the structure of future nostalgia. Do not abuse your powers or they will lead you astray. They will leave you like rebellious daughters. They will lose their virtue. They will become lost and resentful and finally become pregnant with the seed of folly. Soon you will be the grandparent of a broken state. You will be mocked. It will fall apart like a stone that recalls that it is really water.\"\n\"Keep nothing in your house that is neither needed or beautiful.\"\n\"Ordeals you should face unimpeded by the world of restriction. The splendor of stars is &lt;a href=\"Ayem\"&gt;Ayem&lt;/a&gt;'s domain. The selfishness of the sea is &lt;a href=\"Seht\"&gt;Seht&lt;/a&gt;'s. I rule the middle air. All else is earth and under your temporal command. There is no bone that cannot be broken, except for the &lt;a href=\"Heart%20of%20Lorkhan\"&gt;heart bone&lt;/a&gt;. You will see it twice in your lifetimes. Take what you can the first time and let us do the rest.\"\n\"There is no true symbolism of the center. The &lt;a href=\"Sharmat\"&gt;Sharmat&lt;/a&gt; will believe there is. He will feel that he can cause years of exuberance from sitting in the sacred, when really no one can leave that state and cause anything more but strife.\"\n\"There is once more the case of the symbolic and barren. The true prince that is cursed and demonized will be adored at last with full hearts. According to the Codes of &lt;a href=\"Mephala\"&gt;Mephala&lt;/a&gt; there can be no official art, only fixation points of complexity that will erase from the awe of the people given enough time. This is a secret that hides another. An impersonal survival is not the way of the ruling king. Embrace the art of the people and marry it and by that I mean secretly have it murdered.\"\n\"The ruling king that sees in another his equivalent rules nothing.\"\n\"The secret of weapons is this: they are the mercy seat.\"\n\"The secret of language is this: it is immobile.\"\n\"The ruling king is armored head to toe in brilliant flame. He is redeemed by each act he undertakes. His death is only a diagram back to the waking world. He sleeps the second way. The Sharmat is his double, and therefore you wonder if you rule nothing.\"\n\"Hortator and Sharmat, one and one, eleven, an inelegant number. Which of the ones is the more important? Could you ever tell if they switched places? I can and that is why you will need me.\"\n\"According to the Codes of Mephala, there is no difference between the theorist and the terrorist. Even the most cherished desire disappears in their hands. This is why Mephala has black hands. Bring both of yours to every argument. The one-handed king finds no remedy. When you approach God, however, cut both of them off. God has no need of theory and he is armored head to toe in terror.\"\nThe ending of the words is &lt;a href=\"ALMSIVI\"&gt;ALMSIVI&lt;/a&gt;."}

He left a few of his own behind to make the journey worthwhile.\nThen Vivec left the capital of &lt;a href=\"Veloth\"&gt;Veloth&lt;/a&gt; and wandered far into the ash. He found a span of badlands to practice his giant-form. He made of his feet a less dense material than the divine to keep from falling waist-deep into the earth. At this point the First Corner of the &lt;a href=\"House%20of%20Troubles\"&gt;House of Troubles&lt;/a&gt;, the Prince &lt;a href=\"Molag%20Bal\"&gt;Molag Bal&lt;/a&gt;, made his presence known.\nVivec looked on the King of Rape and said:\n'How very beautiful you are, that you do not join us. '\nAnd Molag Bal crushed the warrior-poet's feet, which were not invulnerable, and had legions cleave them off. Mighty fires from the Beginning Place were brought like nets to hold Vivec and he let them.\n'I would prefer,' he said, 'some kind of ceremony if we are to be married.'\nAnd the legions that took the feet were summoned again and ordered to begin a banquet. Pomegranates sprang from the badlands and tents were raised. A throng of &lt;a href=\"Velothi\"&gt;Velothi&lt;/a&gt; mystics came, reading the passages of the severed feet on the ground and weeping until the scriptures were wet.\n'We must love each other briefly,' Vivec said, 'if at all. I am needed to counsel the Hortator in more important matters because the &lt;a href=\"Dwemer\"&gt;Dwemer&lt;/a&gt;i high priests stir up trouble. You may have my head for an hour.'\nMolag Bal rose up and extended six arms to show his worth. They were decorated in runes of seduction and its reverse.

When the gods of Veloth would retreat unto their own, to mold the cosmos and other matters, the Hortator would at times become confused. Vivec would always be there to advise him, and this is the second of the three lessons of ruling kings:\n'The secret syllable of royalty is this: (You must learn this elsewhere.)\n'The temporal myth is man.\n'The magical cross is an integration of the worth of mortals at the expense of their spirits. Surround it with the triangle and you begin to see the Triune house. It becomes divided into corners, which are ruled by our brethren, the Four Corners: &lt;a href=\"Molag%20Bal\"&gt;BAL&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Mehrunes%20Dagon\"&gt;DAGON&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Malacath\"&gt;MALAC&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Sheogorath\"&gt;SHEOG&lt;/a&gt;. Rotate the triangle and you pierce the heart of the Beginning Place, the foul lie, the testament of the irrefutable-for-a-span. Above them all is the horizon where only one stands, though no one stands there yet. It is proof of the new. It is the promise of the wise. Unfold the whole and what you have is a star, which is not my domain, but not entirely outside my judgment. The grand design takes flight; it is transformed not only into a star but a hornet. The center cannot hold. It becomes devoid of lines and points. It becomes devoid of anything and so becomes a receptacle. This is its usefulness at the end. This is its promise.\n'The sword is the cross and ALMSIVI is the &lt;a href=\"Tribunal\"&gt;Triune house&lt;/a&gt; around it. If there is to be an end I must be removed. The ruling king must know this, and I will test him. I will murder him time and again until he knows this. I am the defender of the last and the last. To remove me is to refill the heart that lay dormant at the center that cannot hold. I am the sword, Ayem the star, Seht the mechanism that allows the transformation of the world. Ours is the duty to keep the compromise from being filled with black sea.\n'The &lt;a href=\"Sharmat\"&gt;Sharmat&lt;/a&gt; sleeps at the center. He cannot bear to see it removed, the world of reference. This is the folly of the false dreamer. This is the amnesia of dream, or its power, or its circumvention. This is the weaker magic and it is barbed in venom.\n'This is why I say the secret to swords is the mercy seat. It is my throne. I am become the voice of ALMSIVI. The world will know me more than my sister and brother. I am the psychopomp. I am the killer of the weeds of &lt;a href=\"Veloth\"&gt;Veloth&lt;/a&gt;. Veloth is the center that cannot hold. &lt;a href=\"Ayem\"&gt;Ayem&lt;/a&gt; is the plot. &lt;a href=\"Seht\"&gt;Seht&lt;/a&gt; is the ending. I am the enigma that must be removed. These are why my words are armed to the teeth.\n'The ruling king is to stand against me and then before me. He is to learn from my punishment. I will mark him to know. He is to come as male or female. I am the form he must acquire.\n'Because a ruling king that sees in another his equivalent rules nothing.'\nThis is what was said to the Hortator when Vivec was not whole.\nThe ending of the words is ALMSIVI."}

In that time, the &lt;a href=\"Daedric%20Princes\"&gt;Prince&lt;/a&gt; placed the warrior-poet's feet back and filled them with the blood of &lt;a href=\"Daedra\"&gt;Daedra&lt;/a&gt;. In this way Vivec's giant-form remained forever harmless to good earth. The Pomegranate Banquet brought many spirits back from the dead so that the sons and daughters of the union had much to eat besides fruit.\nThe Duke of &lt;a href=\"Scamp\"&gt;Scamp&lt;/a&gt;s came while the banquet was still underway, and Molag Bal looked on the seven pennants with anger. The King of Rape had become necessary and therefore troubled for the rest of time. His legions and Kh-Utta's fell into open war, but the children of Molag Bal and Vivec were too elaborate in power and form.\nThe Duke of Scamps therefore became a lesser thing, as did all his own children. Molag Bal said to them: 'You are the sons of liars, dogs, and wolf-headed women.' They have been useless to summon ever since.\nThe holy one returned at last, Vehk, golden with wisdom. His head found its body had been tenderly used. He mentioned this to Molag Bal, who told him that he should thank the Barons of Move Like This, 'For I have yet to learn how to refine my rapture. My love is accidentally shaped like a spear.'\nSo Vivec, who had a grain of &lt;a href=\"Ayem\"&gt;Ayem&lt;/a&gt;'s mercy, set about to teach Molag Bal in the ways of belly-magic. They took their spears out and compared them. Vivec bit new words onto the King of Rape's so that it might give more than ruin to the uninitiated. This has since become a forbidden ritual, though people still practice it in secret.\nHere is why: The &lt;a href=\"Chimer\"&gt;Velothi&lt;/a&gt; and demons and monsters that were watching all took out their own spears. There was much biting and the earth became wet. And this was the last laugh of Molag Bal:\nWatch as the earth shall crack, heavy with so much power, that should have been forever unalike!'\nThen that stretch of badlands that had been the site of the marriage fragmented and threw fire. And a race that is no more but that was terrible at the time to behold came forth. Born of the biters, that is all they did, and they ran amok across the lands of &lt;a href=\"Veloth\"&gt;Veloth&lt;/a&gt; and even to the shores of &lt;a href=\"Red%20Mountain\"&gt;Red Mountain&lt;/a&gt;.\nBut Vivec made of his spear a more terrible thing, from a secret he had bitten off from the King of Rape. And so he sent Molag Bal tumbling into the crack of the biters and swore forever that he would not deem the King beautiful ever again.\nVivec wept as he slew all those around him with his terrible new spear. He named it &lt;a href=\"Muatra\"&gt;MUATRA&lt;/a&gt;, which is Milk Taker, and even the &lt;a href=\"Chimer\"&gt;Chimer&lt;/a&gt;i mystics knew his fury. Anyone struck by Vivec at this time turned barren and withered into bone shapes. The path of bones became a sentence for the stars to read, and the heavens have never known children since. Vivec hunted down the biters one by one, and all their progeny, and he killed them all by means of the Nine Apertures, and the wise still hide theirs from Muatra.\nThe ending of the words is &lt;a href=\"ALMSIVI\"&gt;ALMSIVI&lt;/a&gt;."}

They were slippery in his mind. He could not always keep the words straight and knew that this was a danger. He wandered to find Vivec, his lord and master, the glory of the image of &lt;a href=\"Veloth\"&gt;Veloth&lt;/a&gt;, and found him of all places in the Temple of False Thinking. There, clockwork shears were taking off &lt;a href=\"Vivec\"&gt;Vivec&lt;/a&gt;'s hair. A beggar king had brought his loom and was making of the hair an incomplete map of adulthood and death.\n&lt;a href=\"Nerevar\"&gt;Nerevar&lt;/a&gt; said, \"Why are you doing this, milord?\"\n\"Vivec said, \"To make room for the fire.\"\nAnd the &lt;a href=\"Hortator\"&gt;Hortator&lt;/a&gt; could see that Vivec was out of sorts, though not because of the impending new power to come. The golden warrior-poet had been exercising his Water Face as well, learned from the &lt;a href=\"Dreugh%20%28Morrowind%29\"&gt;dreughs&lt;/a&gt; before he was born.\nNerevar said, \"Is this to keep you from the fire?\"\nVivec said, \"It is so that I may see with truth. It, and my place here at the altar of &lt;a href=\"Padomay\"&gt;Padhome&lt;/a&gt; in the house of False Thinking, serve so that I may see beyond my own secrets. The Water Face cannot lie. It comes from the ocean, which is too busy to think, much less lie. Moving water resembles truth by its trembling.\"\nNerevar said, \"I am afraid to become slipshod in my thinking.\"\nVivec said, \"Reach heaven by violence then.\"\nSo to quiet his mind the Hortator chose from the Fight Racks an &lt;a href=\"Axes%20%28Morrowind%29\"&gt;axe&lt;/a&gt;. He named it and moved on to the first moon.\nThere, Nerevar was greeted by the Parliament of Craters, who knew him by title and resented his presence, for he was to be a ruling king of earth and this was the lunar realm. They shifted around him in a pattern of entrapment.\n\"The moon does not recognize crowns or scepters,\" they said, \"nor the representatives of kingdoms below, lion or &lt;a href=\"Tsaesci\"&gt;serpent&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"Dwemer\"&gt;mathematician&lt;/a&gt;. We are the graves of those that have migrated and become ancient countries. We seek no Queens or thrones. Your appearance is decidedly solar, which is to say a library of stolen ideas. We are neither tear nor sorrow. Our revolution succeeded in the manner that is was written. You are the Hortator and unwelcome here.\"\nAnd so Nerevar carved at the grave ghosts until he was out of breath and their Parliament could make no new laws.\nHe said, \"I am not of the slaves that perish.\"\nOf the members of Parliament only a few survived the Hortator's attack.\nA surviving Crater said, \"Appropriation is nothing new. Everything happens of itself. This motif is by no means unassociated with hero myths. You have not acted with the creative impulse; you fall below the weight of destiny. We are graves but not coffins. Know the difference. You have only dug more and supplied no ghosts to reside within. Central to your claim is the predominance of frail events.

He was thrown out of the library of the sun by the power of &lt;a href=\"Magnus\"&gt;Magnus&lt;/a&gt;. Vivec found him in a grub field outside of the swamps of the &lt;a href=\"Deshaan%20Plain\"&gt;Deshaan Plain&lt;/a&gt;. They walked for a span in silence, for Nerevar had been humbled and Vivec still had mercy in his hand.\nSoon they were walking across the eastern sea to the land of snakes and snow demons. Vivec wanted to show the Hortator the fighting styles of foreign tongues. They learned the idiom stroke from the pillow book of the &lt;a href=\"Tsaesci\"&gt;Tsaesci&lt;/a&gt; king. It is shaped like the insight of this page. The Tsaesci serpents vowed to have their vengeance on the west &lt;a href=\"Akaviri%20Invasions\"&gt;at least three times.&lt;/a&gt;\nThey walked farther and saw the spiked waters at the edge of the map. Here the spirit of limitation gifted them with a spoke and bade them find the rest of the wheel.\nThe Hortator said, 'The edge of the world is made of swords.'\nVivec corrected him. 'They are the bottom row of the world's teeth.'\nThey walked to the north to the &lt;a href=\"Atmora\"&gt;Elder Wood&lt;/a&gt; and found nothing but frozen bearded kings.\nThey came to the &lt;a href=\"Yokuda\"&gt;west&lt;/a&gt; where the &lt;a href=\"Redguard\"&gt;black men&lt;/a&gt; dwelt. For a year they studied under their &lt;a href=\"Sword-Singers\"&gt;sword saints&lt;/a&gt; and then for another Vivec taught them the virtue of the little reward. Vivec chose a king for a wife and made another race of monsters which ended up destroying the west completely. To a warrior chief Vivec said:\n'We must not act and speak as if asleep.'\nNerevar wondered if there was anything to learn in the south but Vivec remained silent and only led them back to &lt;a href=\"Red%20Mountain\"&gt;Red Mountain&lt;/a&gt;.\n'Here,' Vivec said, 'is the last of the last. Within it the &lt;a href=\"Sharmat\"&gt;Sharmat&lt;/a&gt; waits.'\nBut they both knew that the time was not ready to contest the Sharmat and so they engaged in combat with each other. Vivec marked the Hortator in this way for all of the &lt;a href=\"Velothi\"&gt;Velothi&lt;/a&gt; to see. He sealed the wound with the blessing of &lt;a href=\"Ayem\"&gt;Ayem&lt;/a&gt;-&lt;a href=\"Azura\"&gt;Azura&lt;/a&gt;. At the end of the battle, the Hortator found that he had gathered seven more spokes. He attempted to attach them and form a &lt;a href=\"Staff%20of%20Chaos\"&gt;staff&lt;/a&gt; but Vivec would not let him, saying, 'It is not the time for that.'\nNerevar said, 'Where did I find these?'\nVivec said that they had collected them from around the world, though some had come invisibly. 'I am the &lt;a href=\"Aurbis\"&gt;wheel&lt;/a&gt;,' he said, and took that shape. Before the emptiness at the center could live too long, Nerevar put in the spokes.\nThe ending of the words is ALMSIVI."}

The first spirit threw his arms about her and hugged his knowledge in tight. The netchiman's wife became soaked in the Incalculable Effort.

They could ghost touch and probed inside the egg to find its core.

The egg-image, however, could see into what it had been before in ancient times, when the earth still cooled, and was not blinded.\nIt joined with the &lt;a href=\"Daedra\"&gt;Daedroth&lt;/a&gt; and took its former secrets, leaving a few behind to keep the web of the world from disentangling. Then the Black Hands Mephala put the egg back into the netchiman's wife and blew on her with magic breath until the hole closed up.

I am in fact made of many straight lines, though none last too long. In this way I have learned to ignore all true segments.'\nLuckily, the sword not held was curved and therefore could cut into Moon Axle, and before the sun was up he was bleeding from many wounds. Vivec did not slay him outright for to do so would keep the foibles of nature within him and not back where they belonged. Soon Vivec had traced geography right again, and Moon Axle was ready to be slain.\nVivec rose up in his giant-form, to be terrible to look upon. He reached into the west and pulled out a canyon, holding it like a horn. He reached east and ate a handful of &lt;a href=\"Nix-Hound%20%28Morrowind%29\"&gt;nix hounds&lt;/a&gt;. Blowing their spirits through the canyon made a terrible wail, not unlike an unsolved woman. He said:\n'Let this overtake you,' and Moon Axle was overtaken by the curvatures of stolen souls. They wrapped about the monster like resin, until finally he could not move, nor could his dual nature.\nVivec said, 'Now you are solved,' and pierced his child with Muatra. Moon Axle had been reduced to something static, and therefore shattered.\nThe lines of Moon Axle were collected by &lt;a href=\"Veloth\"&gt;Veloth&lt;/a&gt;i philosophers and taken into caves. There, and for a year, Vivec taught the philosophers how to turn the lines of his son into the spokes of mystery wheels. This was the birth of the first Whirling School. Before, there had only been the surface thought of fire.\nVivec looked at his first wheeling students and observed:\n'Alike the egg-layered universe is this morbid possession of three-distant coverage, soul-wrecked and alive, like my name is alive. In this cloister you have discovered one walking path, hilled like a sword but more coarsened. So edged it is that it has to be whispered to keep the tongue from bleeding, where its signs evacuate their former meanings, like empires that tarry too long.\n'The sword is estrangement from statesmanship.\n'Look on the estimable lines of my son, now crafted star-wise, his every limb equidistant from the center. Is he solved because I will it so? There cannot be a second stage. Think on the theory that my existence promulgates the five elements and alike the egg-layered universe I am cause for great density. Here is a thought that can break the wagon's axle; here is another that can soar.'\nThe ending of the words is &lt;a href=\"ALMSIVI\"&gt;ALMSIVI&lt;/a&gt;."}

Within years of the Pomegranate Banquet, it had become a lessoning tune to the lower &lt;a href=\"Velothi\"&gt;Velothi&lt;/a&gt; houses. They preached of its power:\n'The Treasure Wood Sword, splinter scintilla of the high and glorious! He who wields it becomes self-known!'\nThe warrior-poet appeared as a visitation in the ancestor alcove of House Mora, whose rose-worn prince of garlands was a hero against the northern demons. Vivec congregated with the bones. He said:\n'A scavenger cannot acquire a silk sash and expect to discover the greater systems of its predecessor: perfect happiness is embraced only by the weeping. Give me back (and do so freely) what is barren of my marriage and I will not erase you from the thought realm of God. Your line has a notable enchantress that my sister Ayem is fond of and from her murky wisdom alone do I condescend to ask.'\nA &lt;a href=\"Bonewalker\"&gt;bone-walker&lt;/a&gt; emerged from a wall. It had three precious stones set in its lower jaw, a magical practice of old. One was opal, the color of opal. The bone-walker bowed to the prince of the middle air and said:\n'The Treasure Wood Sword will not leave our house. Bargains were made with the Black Hands &lt;a href=\"Mephala\"&gt;Mephala&lt;/a&gt;, the greater shade.'\nVivec kissed the first precious stone and said:\n'Animal picture, rude-walker, go back to the lamp that stays lit in water and store no more messages of useless noise.

They became as black queens, screaming live with a hundred murderous sons, a thousand murderous arms, and a hundred thousand murderous hands, one vast moving event of thrusting-kill-laughter in alleys, palaces, workshops, cities and secret halls. Their movements among the holdings of the &lt;a href=\"Ra%27athim\"&gt;Ra'athim&lt;/a&gt; were as rippled endings, heaving between times, with all fates leading to swallowed knives, murder as moaning, God's holy rape-erasure of wet death.\nThe King of Assassins presented to Vivec the Treasure Wood Sword.\n'Milord,' the King of Assassins said.

It was made of modular warriors running free but spaced according to pattern, and from the highest warrior who could cut clouds they spread out beneath him like a tree, a skirt whose bottom circle was an army that ran through the ash.\nVivec admired the cone-shape of his child and remembered with joy the whirlwind of fighting styles that instructed him &lt;a href=\"36%20Lessons%20of%20Vivec%2C%20Sermon%201\"&gt;during the days before life&lt;/a&gt;.\nVivec moved into &lt;a href=\"Veloth\"&gt;Veloth&lt;/a&gt;, saying, 'Onus.'\nBut before he could even get within sword-span of the monster, a trio of lower houses had trapped Horde Mountain in a net of doubtful doctrine. When they saw their lord, the Velothi cheered.\n'We are happy to serve you and win!' they said.\nVivec smiled at those brave souls around him and summoned celebration demons to cleave unto the victors. There was a great display of love and duty around the netted monster, and Vivec was at the center with a headdress made of mating bones. He laughed and told mystical jokes and made the heads of the three houses marry and become a new order.\n'You shall forever be now my &lt;a href=\"Buoyant%20Armigers%20%28Morrowind%29\"&gt;Buoyant Armigers&lt;/a&gt;,' he said.\nThen Vivec pierced Horde Mountain with &lt;a href=\"Muatra\"&gt;Muatra&lt;/a&gt; and made of it all a big bag of bones. At the touch of his right hand the net became right scripture and he threw it all northeasterly. The contents spread out like sugar-glows and Vivec and the Buoyant Armigers ran under it laughing.\nFinally the bones of Horde Mountain landed and became the foundation stones for the &lt;a href=\"Vivec%20City\"&gt;City of Swords&lt;/a&gt;, which Vivec named after his own sigil, and the net fell across it all and between, or became as bridges between bones, and since its segments had been touched by his holy wisdom they became the most perfect of all city streets in the known worlds.\nThrongs of Velothi came to the new city and &lt;a href=\"Ayem\"&gt;Ayem&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Seht\"&gt;Seht&lt;/a&gt; gave it their blessing.

From the Provisional House he looked into the middle world to find the fourth monster, called The Pocket Cabal.\nThe monster hid itself in the spell-lists of the great &lt;a href=\"Chimer\"&gt;Chimer&lt;/a&gt;i wizards of the extreme east, where the &lt;a href=\"Emperor%20Parasol\"&gt;Emperor Parasol&lt;/a&gt;s grow wild. Vivec disguised himself as a simple traveler, but radiated a tenuous sense-fabric so that the wizards would seek him out. Of &lt;a href=\"Muatra\"&gt;Muatra&lt;/a&gt; he made a simple walking dwarf.\nBefore long the invisible one was among the libraries of the east, feeding the essential words of The Pocket Cabal to his walking dwarf and then running when the magic would fail. After a year or two of this thievery, Muatra was sick to its stomach, and the walking dwarf exploded near the slave pens of a wizard's tower. The Pocket Cabal then slipped itself into the mouths of the slaves and hid again.\nVivec then watched as the slaves erupted into babble and breaking magic. They rattled their cages and sung out half-hymns that formed into forbidden and arcane knowledge. Litany fiends appeared and drank from the excess. Grabbers from the &lt;a href=\"Lyg\"&gt;Adjacent Place&lt;/a&gt; came into the world sideways, the slave talking having disrupted the normal non-cardinal points.\nSo of course a giant bug appeared, with the greatest eastern wizard inside it. He could see past Vivec's disguise and knew of the warrior-poet's divinity but he thought himself so powerful that he talked harshly:\n'See what you have wrought, silly &lt;a href=\"Tribunal\"&gt;Triune&lt;/a&gt;! Columns of nonsense and litany fiends! I cannot believe how reason or temperance can be made whole again due to your eating, eating, eating! &lt;a href=\"36%20Lessons%20of%20Vivec%2C%20Sermon%2012\"&gt;Consort with more demons&lt;/a&gt;, why don't you?'\nVivec stabbed the wizard through his soul.\nThe giant bug harness fell on the slave cages and the slaves ran about free and reckless, too reckless more with pregnant words. Colors bent into the earth. Vivec created a dome-head demon to contain it all.\n'The Pocket Cabal is therefore interred here forever. Let this be a cursed land where sorcery is broken and maligned.'\nThen he picked up Muatra by the beard and left the ghostly hemisphere of the dome-head demon. On its boundaries, Vivec placed a warning and a song of entrance that contained errors in it. With mock bones of half-dead Muatra he created the tent poles of a fortress-theory and fatal languages were imprisoned for all time.\nSeht appeared and looked on what his brother-sister had created. The &lt;a href=\"Clockwork%20City%20%28Tribunal%29\"&gt;Clockwork King&lt;/a&gt; said:\n'Of the eight monsters, this is the most confusing. May I treasure it?'\nVivec gave Seht leave to do so, but told him never to release The Pocket Cabal into the middle world. He said:\n'I have hidden secrets in my travels here and made a likeness of Muatra to ward against the unwise.

From the Provisional House he looked into the middle world to find the fifth monster, called The &lt;a href=\"Ruddy%20Man\"&gt;Ruddy Man&lt;/a&gt;.\nWhen the &lt;a href=\"Dreugh%20%28Morrowind%29\"&gt;dreughs&lt;/a&gt; ruled the world, the &lt;a href=\"Daedroth%20%28Morrowind%29\"&gt;Daedroth&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Daedric%20Prince\"&gt;Prince&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Molag%20Bal\"&gt;Molag Bal&lt;/a&gt; had been their chief. He took a different shape then, spiny and armored and made for the sea. Vivec, in giving birth to the many spawn of his marriage, had dropped an old image of Molag Bal into the world: a dead carapace of memory. It would not have been a monster if a &lt;a href=\"Veloth\"&gt;Veloth&lt;/a&gt;i child had not wanted to impress his village by wearing it.\nThe Ruddy Man, of the eight monsters, was the least complicated. He made those who wore him into mighty killers and nothing more. He existed in the physical. Only geography makes him special.\nWhen Vivec found him near the boy's village, anon &lt;a href=\"Gnisis\"&gt;Gnisis&lt;/a&gt;, there was a violent clash of arms and an upheaval of the earth. Their battle created the &lt;a href=\"West%20Gash\"&gt;West Gash&lt;/a&gt;. Wanderers that still go there hear still the sounds of it: sword across the crust, the grunt of God, the snapping of his monster child's splintered legs.\nAfter his victory, Vivec took the shell of The Ruddy Man to the dreughs that had modified his mother. The Queen of Dreughs, whose name is not easy to spell, was in a period of self-incubation. Her wardens took the gift from Vivec and promised to guard it from the surface world. This is the first account of dreughs being liars.\nIn ten years, The Ruddy Man appeared again, this time near &lt;a href=\"Tear\"&gt;Tear&lt;/a&gt;, worn by a wayward shaman who followed the House of Troubles. Instead of guarding it, the dreughs had imbued the living armor with mythic inflexibility. It molted soon after skill-draping the shaman and stretched his bones to the five corners.\nWhen Vivec met the monster in battle again he saw the remains of three villages dripping from its feet. He took on his giant form and slew The Ruddy Man by way of the Symbolic Collage. Since he no longer trusted the &lt;a href=\"Maormer\"&gt;Altmer of the sea&lt;/a&gt;, Vivec gave the carapace of the monster to the devout and loyal mystics of the Number Room. He told them:\n'You may make of The Ruddy Man a philosopher's armor.'\nThe mystics began by wrapping one of their sages in the shells, a series of flourishes by two supra numerates, one hormonally tall and the other just under his arms. They ran around the carapace and through each other, applying holy resin drawn from the carcasses of the now-useless numbers between twelve and thirteen. Golden straws were quickly stuck through the mythic epidermal so the sage could breathe. After the ceremonial etchings were drawn into hardening resin, long lists of dead names and equations whose solutions were to be found in the mouth of the &lt;a href=\"Chimer\"&gt;Chimer&lt;/a&gt; inside, there came the illuminations, inscribed by the bright, terrible fingernail of Vivec. From the nail's tip flowed a searing liquid, filling the grooves of the ceremonial etchings. They bled out to form veined patterns about the sage-shell that theologians would decipher forever after.\nThe ending of the words is &lt;a href=\"ALMSIVI\"&gt;ALMSIVI&lt;/a&gt;."}

Nothing was of any use, and the egg of Vivec remained safe within her.\nA Dwemer said, 'Nothing is of any use. We must go and misinterpret this.'\n&lt;a href=\"Vivec\"&gt;Vivec&lt;/a&gt; felt that his mother was afraid, and so consoled her.\n'The fire is mine: let it consume thee,\nAnd make a secret door\nAt the altar of &lt;a href=\"Padhome\"&gt;Padhome&lt;/a&gt;,\nIn the House of &lt;a href=\"Boethiah\"&gt;Boet-hi-Ah&lt;/a&gt;\nWhere we become safeAnd looked after.'\nThis old prayer made the netchiman's wife smile and begin such a deep sleep that when &lt;a href=\"Animunculi\"&gt;Dwemeri atronachs&lt;/a&gt; returned with cornered spheres and cut her apart she did not awake and died peacefully. Vivec was removed from her womb and placed within a magical glass for further study. To confound his captors, he channeled his essence into love, an emotion the Dwemer knew nothing about.\nThe egg said:\n'Love is used not only as a constituent in moods and affairs, but also as the raw material from which relationships produce hour-later exasperations, regrettably fashioned restrictions, riddles laced with affections known only to the loving couple, and looks that linger too long. Love is also an often-used ingredient in some transparent verbal and nonverbal transactions where, eventually, it can sometimes be converted to a variety of true devotions, some of which yield tough, insoluble, and infusible unions. In its basic form, love supplies approximately thirteen draughts of all energy that is derived from relationships. Its role and value in society at large are controversial.'\nThe Dwemer were vexed at these words and tried to hide behind their power symbols. They sent their atronachs to remove the egg-image from their cave and place it within the simulacrum they had made of Vivec's mother.\nA &lt;a href=\"Dwemer\"&gt;Dwemer&lt;/a&gt; said, 'We Dwemer are only aspirants to this that the Velothi have. They shall be our doom in this and the eight known worlds, &lt;a href=\"Nirn\"&gt;NIRN&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Lorkhan\"&gt;LHKAN&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Arkay\"&gt;RKHET&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Stendarr\"&gt;THENDR&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Kynareth\"&gt;KYNRT&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Akatosh\"&gt;AKHAT&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Mara\"&gt;MHARA&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Jhunal\"&gt;JHUNAL&lt;/a&gt;.' The secret to doom is within this Sermon.\nThe ending of the words is &lt;a href=\"ALMSIVI\"&gt;ALMSIVI&lt;/a&gt;."}

From the Provisional House he looked into the middle world to find the sixth monster, called City-Face. He was vexed when he could not find it and went back to the &lt;a href=\"Mournhold\"&gt;Mourning Hold&lt;/a&gt; in secret anger, killing a mystic that asked about higher order.\n&lt;a href=\"Nerevar\"&gt;Nerevar&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"Hortator\"&gt;Hortator&lt;/a&gt;, witnessed this and said, 'Why do this, milord? The mystics look to you for guidance. They work to make your temple better stoned.'\nVivec said, 'No one knows what I am.'\nThe Hortator nodded and went back to his studies.\nHere is how City-Face hid from his mother-father: it had been born named as Ha-Note, a bare urge of power, an esoteric wind nerve tuned to the frequency of huddled masses. It found root in villages and multiplied, finding in the minds of the settled a veiled astrology, the star charts of culture, and this resonance made its head swim. Ha-Note moved sideways into the &lt;a href=\"Lyg\"&gt;Adjacent Place&lt;/a&gt;, growing and unbeknownst. Above the vocal, it trembled with new emotions, immortal ones, absorbing more than the thirty known to exist in the middle world. When Ha-Note became gravely homesick, the Grabbers took it.\nA Grabber said, 'New emotions to the lonely occur only of madness. This thing is gone. It is ours now.'\nGrabbers had never made a city of their own, and their glimpse of Vivec's, which shone with holiness through all the spheres, had taken their attention.\n'Under this reason did the issue of Vehk slide into our realm, drawn by our coveting, hidden in loss. We shall build our tower-hope upon its face.'\nNow many years had passed in &lt;a href=\"Resdayn\"&gt;Resdayn&lt;/a&gt;ia, and the high priests of the &lt;a href=\"Dwemer\"&gt;Dwemer&lt;/a&gt; were building something alike as Vivec and alike as the new Ha-Note of the Grabbers. The Hortator was engaged with an army of theirs that had become too brave, talking foolish words, and Nerevar helped destroy them with the help of the orphan legion of &lt;a href=\"Ayem\"&gt;Ayem&lt;/a&gt;. When he went to give trophy to Vivec, he saw his lord under attack by the City-Face. The monster was saying this:\n'Here we are to replace your city, Vehk and Vehk. We are from the place of the more-than-known emotions, and our citizenry has died from it. Two things we came for, but can stay for only one. Either we ask you to correct our error of culture, or merely take yours by dint of force. The second is easiest, we think.'\nVivec sighed.\n'You would replace my direction,' he said. 'I weary of this, though I wanted to kill you an age before. Resdaynia is fallen ill, and I have no time for one more imaginary analogy of an unknown incident. Here, take this.'\nAt which he touched the tower-hope of the City-Face and corrected the error of the Grabbers.\n'And this.'\nAt which he stabbed the heart of the City-Face with the Ethos Knife, which is to say &lt;a href=\"Arkay\"&gt;RKHT&lt;/a&gt; AI AE ALTADOON AI, the short blade of proper commerce.\nThe ending of the words is &lt;a href=\"ALMSIVI\"&gt;ALMSIVI&lt;/a&gt;."}

The Hortator had become the husband of &lt;a href=\"Almalexia\"&gt;Ayem&lt;/a&gt; during this time, and the first saint of the Triune way. &lt;a href=\"Vivec\"&gt;Vivec&lt;/a&gt; had tired of fighting his sons and daughters, and so took a respite from trying to find them.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Hortator\"&gt;Hortator&lt;/a&gt; said to his wife, 'Where is Vivec, my teacher? I love him still, though he grows cold. His lamentations, if I may call them that, have changed the skin of the whole country. He is hardly to be found anywhere in Veloth of late. The people grow dark because of it.'\nAnd Ayem took mercy on her troubled husband and told him that the sword of the &lt;a href=\"Tribunal\"&gt;Triune&lt;/a&gt; had been fighting minor monsters stirred up by the Dwemer as they worked on their brass siege machines. She took the Hortator inside her and showed him where his master was.\nALMSIVI, or at least that aspect that chose to be Vivec, sat in the Litany Hall of the False Thinking Temple after his battle with the Flute-and-Pipe Ogres of the &lt;a href=\"West%20Gash\"&gt;West Gash&lt;/a&gt;. He began writing, again, in his Book of Hours. He had to put on his Water Face first. That way he could separate the bronze of the Old Temple from the blue of the New and write with happiness. Second, he had to take another feather from the &lt;a href=\"Jode\"&gt;Big Moon&lt;/a&gt;, further rendering it dead. That way he could write about mortals with truth. Third, he recalled the &lt;a href=\"36%20Lessons%20of%20Vivec%2C%20Sermon%2014\"&gt;Pomegranate Banquet&lt;/a&gt;, where he was forced to marry to &lt;a href=\"Molag%20Bal\"&gt;Molag Bal&lt;/a&gt; with wet scriptures to cement his likeness as &lt;a href=\"Mephala\"&gt;Mephala&lt;/a&gt; and write with black hands. He wrote:\nThe last time I heard his voice, showing the slightest sign of impatience, I learned to control myself and submit to the will of others. Afterwards, I dared to take on the sacred fire and realized there was no equilibrium with the &lt;a href=\"Et%27Ada\"&gt;ET'ADA&lt;/a&gt;. They were liars, lost roots, and the most I can do is to be an interpreter into the rational. Even that fails the needs of the people. I sit on the mercy seat and pass judgment, the waking state, and the phase aspect of the innate urge. Only here can I doubt, in this book, written in water, broadened to include evil.\nThen Vivec threw his ink on this passage to cover it up (for the lay reader) and wrote instead:\nFind me in the blackened paper, unarmored, in final scenery. Truth is like my husband: instructed to smash, filled with procedure and noise, hammering, weighty, heaviness made schematic, lessons learned only by a mace. Let those that hear me then be buffeted, and let some die in the ash from the striking. Let those that find him find him murdered by illumination, pummeled like a traitorous house, because, if an hour is golden, then immortal I am a secret code. I am the partaker of the &lt;a href=\"Lorkhan\"&gt;Doom Drum&lt;/a&gt;, chosen of all those that dwell in the middle world to wear this crown, which reverberates with truth, and I am the mangling messiah.\nThe ending of the words is &lt;a href=\"ALMSIVI\"&gt;ALMSIVI&lt;/a&gt;."}

From the Provisional House he looked into the middle world to find the seventh monster, called &lt;a href=\"Lie%20Rock\"&gt;Lie Rock&lt;/a&gt;.\nLie Rock was born of Vivec's Second Aperture and was thrown out of the Pomegranate Banquet by a member of the Sweeps, another forgotten guild. The Sweep did not take it for the monster that it was and so he did not expect it to fly from his hand and into the heavens.\n'I am born of golden wisdom and powers that should have forever been unalike! With this nature I am invited into the Hidden Heaven!'\nBy which he meant the Scaled Blanket, made of not-stars, whose number is thirteen. Lie Rock became full of foolishness, haggling with the Void Ghost who hides in the religions of all men. The Void Ghost said:\n'Stay with me a full hundred years and I will give you a power that no divinity will dare disobey.'\nBut before the hundred years was up, Vivec was already looking for Lie Rock and found him.\n'Stupid stone,' Vivec said. 'To hide in the Scaled Blanket is to make a mark on nothing. His bargains are only for ruling kings!'\nSo Vivec sent the &lt;a href=\"Hortator\"&gt;Hortator&lt;/a&gt; to the heavens to shave Lie Rock asunder by the named axe. &lt;a href=\"Nerevar\"&gt;Nerevar&lt;/a&gt; made peace with the south-pole-star of thieving and the north-pole-star of warriors and the third-pole-star, which existed only in the ether, which was governed by the apprentice of &lt;a href=\"Magnus\"&gt;Magnus&lt;/a&gt; the sun. They gave him leave to wander among their charges and gave him red sight by which to find Lie Rock in the Hidden Heaven.\nBy chance, Nerevar met the Void Ghost first, who told him that he was in the wrong place to which the Hortator said, 'Me or you?' and the Void Ghost said both. This sermon does not tell what else was said between these masters.\nLie Rock, however, used the confusion to launch his own attack on the city-god, &lt;a href=\"Vivec%20City\"&gt;Vivec&lt;/a&gt;. He was hastened by all three of the black guardians, who wanted him swiftly gone, though they meant no hostility to the lord of the middle air.\nThe citizenry of Vivec screamed as they saw a shooting star come down out of the sky hole like a toll-road of hell. But Vivec merely raised his hand and froze Lie Rock just above the city and then he pierced the monster with &lt;a href=\"Muatra\"&gt;Muatra&lt;/a&gt;.\nWhen Nerevar returned, he saw the frozen comet above his lord's city. He asked whether or not Vivec wanted it removed.\n'I would have done so myself if I wanted, silly Hortator. I shall keep it there with its last intention intact, so that &lt;a href=\"Red%20Year\"&gt;if the love of the people of this city for me ever disappear, so shall the power that holds back their destruction&lt;/a&gt;.'\nNerevar said, 'Love is under your will only.'\nVivec smiled and told the Hortator that he had become a &lt;a href=\"Ministry%20of%20Truth\"&gt;Minister of Truth&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe ending of the words is &lt;a href=\"ALMSIVI\"&gt;ALMSIVI&lt;/a&gt;."}

From the Provisional House he looked into the middle world to find the eighth and final and mightiest monster, called GULGA MOR JIL and more. The wise must look elsewhere for this string of power.\nVivec called to his side the &lt;a href=\"Hortator\"&gt;Hortator&lt;/a&gt; and this was the first time that &lt;a href=\"Nerevar\"&gt;Nerevar&lt;/a&gt; had ever been to the Provisional House. He had the same vision that Vivec had so many years ago: that of the two-headed &lt;a href=\"ruling%20king\"&gt;ruling king&lt;/a&gt;.\n'Who is that?' he wondered.\nVivec said, 'The &lt;a href=\"Red%20Diamond\"&gt;red jewel of conquest&lt;/a&gt;.'\nNerevar, perhaps because he was frightened, became vexed at his lord's answer. 'Why are you always so evasive?'\nVivec told the Hortator that to be otherwise was to betray his nature.\nTogether they moved into the middle world, to a village near where Vivec had been found by &lt;a href=\"Ayem\"&gt;Ayem&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Seht\"&gt;Seht&lt;/a&gt;. The eighth monster was there, but he did not act much like a monster. He sat with his legs in the ocean and with a troubled look on his face. When he saw his mother-father, he asked why he should have to die and return to\u00a0&lt;a href=\"Oblivion%20%28Realm%29\"&gt;Oblivion&lt;/a&gt;.\nVivec told the eighth monster that to be otherwise was to betray his nature. Since this did not seem to satisfy the monster and Vivec still had a touch of Ayem's mercy he said:\n'The fire is mine: let it consume thee,And make a secret doorAt the altar of &lt;a href=\"Padomay\"&gt;Padhome&lt;/a&gt;,In the House of &lt;a href=\"Boethiah\"&gt;Boet-hi-Ah&lt;/a&gt;Where we become safeAnd looked after.'\nThe monster accepted &lt;a href=\"Muatra\"&gt;Muatra&lt;/a&gt; with a peaceful look and his bones became the foundation for the City of the Dead, anon .\nNerevar put away his axe, which he had at the ready, and frowned.\n'Why,' he said, 'did you ask me to come if you knew the eighth monster would give in so easily?'\nVivec looked at the Hortator for a long time.\nNerevar understood. 'Do not betray your nature. Answer as you will.'\nVivec said, 'I brought you here because I knew the mightiest of my issue would succumb to Muatra without argument, if only I gave him consolation first.'\nNerevar looked at Vivec for a long time.\nVivec understood. 'Say the words, Hortator.'\nNerevar said, 'Now I am the mightiest of your children.'\nLet this sermon be consolation to those who read it that are destined to die.\nThe ending of the words is &lt;a href=\"ALMSIVI\"&gt;ALMSIVI&lt;/a&gt;."}

Truth owes its medicinal nature to the establishment of the myth of justice. Its curative properties it likewise owes to the concept of sacrifice. Princes, chiefs, and angels all subscribe to the same notion. This is a view primarily based on a prolific abolition of an implied profanity, seen in ceremonies, knife fighting, hunting, and the exploration of the poetic. On the ritual of occasions, which comes to us from the days of the cave glow, I can say nothing more than to loosen your equation of moods to lunar currency. Later, and by that I mean much, much later, my reign will be seen as an act of the highest love, which is a return from the astral destiny and the marriages between. By that I mean the &lt;a href=\"Elder%20Scroll%20%28Lore%29\"&gt;catastrophes&lt;/a&gt;, which will come from all five corners. Subsequent are the revisions, differentiated between hope and the distraught, situations that are only required by the periodic death of the immutable. Cosmic time is repeated: I wrote of this in an earlier life. An imitation of submersion is love's premonition, its folly into the underworld, by which I mean the day you will read about outside of yourself in an age of gold. For on that day, which is a shadow of the sacrificial concept, all history is obliged to see me for what you are: in love with evil. To keep one's powers intact at such a stage is to allow for the existence of what can only be called a continual spirit. Make of your love a defense against the horizon. Pure existence is only granted to the holy, which comes in a myriad of forms, half of them frightening and the other half divided into equal parts purposeless and assured. Late is the lover that comes to this by any other walking way than the &lt;a href=\"CHIM\"&gt;fifth&lt;/a&gt;, which is the number of the limit of this world. The lover is the highest country and a series of beliefs. He is the &lt;a href=\"Ruling%20King\"&gt;sacred city bereft of a double&lt;/a&gt;. The uncultivated land of monsters is the rule. This is clearly attested by &lt;a href=\"Anu\"&gt;ANU&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Padomay\"&gt;his double&lt;/a&gt;, which love knows never really happened. Similarly, all the other symbols of absolute reality are ancient ideas ready for their graves, or at least the essence of such. This scripture is directly ordered by the codes of &lt;a href=\"Mephala\"&gt;Mephala&lt;/a&gt;, the origin of sex and murder, defeated only by those who take up those ideas without my intervention. The religious elite is not a tendency or a correlation. They are dogma complemented by the influence of the untrustworthy sea and the governance of the stars, dominated at the &lt;a href=\"36%20Lessons%20of%20Vivec%2C%20Sermon%2029\"&gt;center by the sword&lt;/a&gt;, which is nothing without a victim to cleave unto. This is the love of God and he would show you more: predatory but at the same time instrumental to the will of critical harvest, a scenario by which one becomes as he is, of male and female, the magic &lt;a href=\"hermaphrodite\"&gt;hermaphrodite&lt;/a&gt;. Mark the norms of violence and it barely registers, suspended as it is by treaties written between the original spirits. This should be seen as an opportunity, and in no way tedious, though some will give up for it is easier to kiss the lover than become one. The lower regions crawl with these souls, caves of shallow treasures, meeting in places to testify by way of extension, when love is only satisfied by a considerable (incalculable) effort.'\nThe ending of the words is &lt;a href=\"ALMSIVI\"&gt;ALMSIVI&lt;/a&gt;."}

Their king was &lt;a href=\"Dumac\"&gt;Dumac&lt;/a&gt; Dwarf-Orc, but their high priest was &lt;a href=\"Kagrenac\"&gt;Kagrenac&lt;/a&gt; the Blighter.\nUnder mountains and over them the war with the Dwemer was raged, and then came the northern men to help Kagrenac and they brought &lt;a href=\"Wulfharth\"&gt;Ysmir&lt;/a&gt; again.\nLeading the armies of the Chimer was the slave that would not perish, the Hortator &lt;a href=\"Nerevar\"&gt;Nerevar&lt;/a&gt;, who had traded his axe for the Ethos Knife.

Those that looked upon her were overcome by the meanings of the stars.\nUnder the sea, &lt;a href=\"Seht\"&gt;Seht&lt;/a&gt; stirred and brought the army he had been working on in the castles of glass and coral. Clockwork &lt;a href=\"Dreugh%20%28Morrowind%29\"&gt;dreughs&lt;/a&gt;, mockeries of the Dwemeri war machines, rose up from the seas and took their counterparts back beneath, where they were swallowed forever by the sea.\nRed Mountain exploded as the Hortator went too far inside, seeking the &lt;a href=\"Sharmat\"&gt;Sharmat&lt;/a&gt;.\nDwemeri high priest Kagrenac then revealed that which he had built in the image of &lt;a href=\"Vivec\"&gt;Vivec&lt;/a&gt;. It was a &lt;a href=\"Numidium\"&gt;walking star&lt;/a&gt;, which burnt the armies of the Triune and destroyed the heartland of &lt;a href=\"Morrowind\"&gt;Veloth&lt;/a&gt;, creating the &lt;a href=\"Inner%20Sea\"&gt;Inner Sea&lt;/a&gt;.\nEach of the aspects of the ALMSIVI then rose up together, combining as one, and showed the world the sixth path. Ayem took from the star its fire, Seht took from it its mystery, and Vehk took from it its feet, which had been constructed before the gift of &lt;a href=\"Molag%20Bal\"&gt;Molag Bal&lt;/a&gt; and destroyed in the manner of truth: by a great hammering. When the soul of the Dwemer could walk no more, they were removed from this world.\nResdaynia was no more. It had been redeemed of all the iniquities of the foolish. The ALMSIVI drew nets from the Beginning Place and captured the ash of Red Mountain, which they knew was the Blight of the Dwemer and that would serve only to infect the whole of the middle world, and ate it.

Along the journey many more spirits came to see it and offer instructions to its son-daughter, the future glorious invisible warrior-poet of &lt;a href=\"Vvardenfell%20%28Morrowind%29\"&gt;Vvardenfell&lt;/a&gt;, Vivec.\nA troupe of spirits called the Lobbyists for the Coincidence Guild appeared. Vivec understood the challenge immediately and said:\n'The popular notion of God kills happenstance.'\nThe head of the Lobbyists, whose name is forgotten, tried to defend the concept's existence. He said, 'Saying something at the same time can be magical.'\nVivec knew that to retain his divinity that he must make a strong argument against luck. He said:\n'Is not the sudden revelation of corresponding conditions and disparate elements that gel at the moment of the coincidence one of the prerequisites to being, in fact, coincidental? Synchronicity comes out of repeated coincidences at the lowest level. Further examination shows it is the utter power of the sheer number of coincidences that leads one to the idea that synchronicity is guided by something more than chance. Therefore, synchronicity ends up invalidating the concept of the coincidental, even though they are the symptomatic signs that bring it to the surface.'\nThus was coincidence destroyed in the land of the &lt;a href=\"Veloth\"&gt;Veloth&lt;/a&gt;i.\nThen an &lt;a href=\"Ehlnofey\"&gt;Old Bone of the earth&lt;/a&gt; rose up before the simulacrum of the netchiman's wife and said, 'If you are to be born a ruling king of the world you must confuse it with new words. Set me into pondering.'\n'Very well,' Vivec said, 'Let me talk to you of the world, which I share with mystery and love. Who is her capital? Have you taken the scenic route of her cameo? I have\u2014lightly, in secret, missing candles because they're on the untrue side, and run my hand along the edge of a shadow made from one hundred and three divisions of warmth, and left no proof.'\nAt this the Old Bone folded unto itself twenty times until it became akin to milk, which Vivec drank, becoming a ruling king of the world.\nFinally the Chancellor of Exactitude appeared, and he was perfect to look upon from every angle. Vivec understood the challenge immediately and said:\n'Certitude is for the &lt;a href=\"Dwemer\"&gt;puzzle-box logicians&lt;/a&gt; and girls of white glamour who harbor it on their own time. I am a letter written in uncertainty.'\nThe Chancellor bowed his head and smiled fifty different and perfect ways all at once. He pulled the astrolabe of the universe from his robe and broke it in half, handing both halves to the egg-image of Vivec.\nVivec laughed and said, 'Yes, I know. The slave labor of the senses is as selfish as polar ice, and worsens when energies are spent on a life others regard as fortunate. To be a ruling king I will have to suffer much that cannot be suffered, and to weigh matters that no astrolabe or compass can measure.'\nThe ending of the words is &lt;a href=\"ALMSIVI\"&gt;ALMSIVI&lt;/a&gt;."}

The &lt;a href=\"Dwemer\"&gt;Dwemer&lt;/a&gt; in their haste had built it shoddily and the ashes of &lt;a href=\"Red%20Mountain\"&gt;Red Mountain&lt;/a&gt; slowed its golden tendons. Before long it fell on its knees beside the road to the lands of the &lt;a href=\"House%20Indoril\"&gt;Indoril&lt;/a&gt; and pitched over, to be discovered eighty days later by a &lt;a href=\"Merchants%20%28Morrowind%29\"&gt;merchant&lt;/a&gt; caravan on its way to the capital of &lt;a href=\"Veloth\"&gt;Veloth&lt;/a&gt;, anon &lt;a href=\"Almalexia\"&gt;Almalexia&lt;/a&gt;.\nVivec had not been among his people all the days of his pre-life so he stayed silent and let the Chimer in the caravan think that the simulacrum was broken and empty.\nA &lt;a href=\"Chimer\"&gt;Chimer&lt;/a&gt;i warrior, who was protecting the caravan, said, 'Look here how the Dwemer try to fool us as ever, crafting our likenesses out of their flesh-metals. We should take this to the capital and show our mother Ayem. She will want to see this new strategy of our enemies.'\nBut the merchant captain said, 'I doubt that we shall be paid well for the effort. We can make more money if we stop at Noormoc and sell it to the Red Wives of &lt;a href=\"Mehrunes%20Dagon\"&gt;Dagon&lt;/a&gt;, who pay well for the wonders made by the Deep Folk.'\nBut another Chimer, who was wise in the ways of prophecy, looked on the simulacrum with disquietude. 'Was I not hired on to help you seek the best of fortunes? I say you should listen to your warrior, then, and take this thing to Ayem, for though manufactured by our enemies there is something in it that will become sacred, or has been already.'\nThe merchant captain took pause then and looked on the simulacrum of the netchiman's wife and, though he heeded always the advice of his seers, could do no more than think of the profits to be made at Noormoc. He mainly of the Red Wives' form of recompense, which was four-cornered and good wounded, a belly-magic known nowhere else under the moons. His lust made him deny Ayem his mother. He gave order to change course for Noormoc.\nBefore the caravan could get underway again, the Chimeri warrior who had counseled a passage to the capital threw his money to the merchant captain and said, 'I will pay you thus for the simulacrum and warn you: war is coming with the &lt;a href=\"Nord\"&gt;shaggy men of the north&lt;/a&gt; and I will not have my mother Ayem at uneven odds with one enemy while tending to another.'\n'&lt;a href=\"Nerevar\"&gt;Nerevar&lt;/a&gt;,' the merchant captain said, 'this is not enough. I am Triune in my own way, but I follow the road of my body and demand more.'\nThen Vivec could not remain silent anymore and said into Nerevar's head these words:\n'You can hear the words, so run awayCome, &lt;a href=\"Hortator\"&gt;Hortator&lt;/a&gt;, unfold into a clear unknown,Stay quiet until you've slept in the yesterday,And say no elegies for the melting stone'\nSo Nerevar slew the merchant captain and took the caravan for his own.\nThe ending of the words is &lt;a href=\"ALMSIVI\"&gt;ALMSIVI&lt;/a&gt;."}

The caravan musicians made a great song of entrance and the eleven gates of the &lt;a href=\"Mournhold\"&gt;Mourning Hold&lt;/a&gt; were thrown wide.\n&lt;a href=\"Ayem\"&gt;Ayem&lt;/a&gt; was accompanied by her husband-state, a flickering image that was channeled to her ever-changing female need. Around her were the Shouts, a guild now forgotten, who carried with them the whims of the people, for the &lt;a href=\"Chimer\"&gt;Velothi&lt;/a&gt; then were still mostly good at heart. The Shouts were the counselors of Ayem and the country, though they sometimes quarreled and needed Seht to wring them into usefulness. Ayem approached Nerevar, who was by now adorned in the flags of &lt;a href=\"House%20Indoril\"&gt;House Indoril&lt;/a&gt;. He gifted her with the simulacrum of the netchiman's wife and the egg of Vivec inside.\nAyem said to Nerevar, 'Seht who is &lt;a href=\"Azura\"&gt;Azura&lt;/a&gt; has\u00a0revealed that war is come and that the &lt;a href=\"Hortator\"&gt;Hortator&lt;/a&gt; that shall deliver us will approach with a solution walking at his side.'\nNerevar said, 'I have traveled out of my way to warn you of the deceit of our enemies, the &lt;a href=\"Dwemer\"&gt;Dwemer&lt;/a&gt;, but I have learned much on the journey and have changed my mind. This netchiman's wife you see at my side is a sword and a symbol and there is prophecy inside. It tells me that, like it, we must for awhile be like he is and, as a people, cloaked in our former enemies, and to use their machines without shame.'\nAt which Vivec spoke aloud, '&lt;a href=\"Boethiah\"&gt;Boethiah&lt;/a&gt;-who-is-you wore the skin of &lt;a href=\"Trinimac\"&gt;Trinimac&lt;/a&gt; to cleanse the faults of &lt;a href=\"Veloth\"&gt;Veloth&lt;/a&gt;, my Queen, and so it should be again. This is the walking way of the glorious.'\nSeht appeared out of a cloud of iron vapor and his minions made of their blood a chair. He sat beside Ayem and looked on the rebirth of mastery.\nVivec said to them, his &lt;a href=\"Tribunal\"&gt;Triune&lt;/a&gt;:\n'My rituals and ordeals and all the rhymes within,Use no other motive than the revelation of my skin.'\nAyem said, 'AYEM AE SEHTI AE VEHK. We are delivered and made whole, the diamond of the Black Hands is uncovered.'\nSeht said, 'Wherever so he treads, there is invisible scripture.'\nTo which the Shouts were silent in sudden reading.\nVivec then reached out from the egg all his limbs and features, merging with the simulacrum of his mother, gilled and blended in all the arts of the star-wounded East, under water and in fire and in metal and in ash, six times the wise, and he became the union of male and female, the magic &lt;a href=\"hermaphrodite\"&gt;hermaphrodite&lt;/a&gt;, the martial axiom, the sex-death of language and unique in all the middle world.\nHe said, 'Let us now guide the hands of the Hortator in war and its aftermath.

The greatest demon chieftains of the frigid west were those listed below, five in unholy number.\n&lt;a href=\"Hoag%20Merkiller\"&gt;HOAGA&lt;/a&gt;, the Mouth of Mud, who appeared as a great bearded king, had the powers of Marshalling and breathing the earth. On the battlefields, this demon would often be seen on the sidelines, eating the soil voraciously. When his men fell, Hoaga would fill their bodies back with it, whereupon they would rise again and fight, albeit slower. He had a Secret Name, Fenja, and destroyed seventeen &lt;a href=\"Chimer\"&gt;Chimer&lt;/a&gt;i villages and two &lt;a href=\"Dwemer\"&gt;Dwemer&lt;/a&gt;i strongholds before being turned away.\nCHEMUA, the Running Hunger, who appeared as a mounted soldier with full helm, had the powers of Heart Roaring and of sky sickening. He ate the Chimeri hero, Dres Khizumet-e, sending the spirit back to the Hortator as an assassin. Sometimes called First Blighter, Chemua could give clouds stomach aches and turn the rain of Veloth into bile. He destroyed six Chimeri villages before he was slain by Vivec and the Hortator.\nBHAG, the Two-Tongued, who appeared as a great bearded king, had the powers of Surety and Form Change. His raiders were small in number, but ran amok in the west hinterlands, killing many &lt;a href=\"Velothi\"&gt;Velothi&lt;/a&gt; trappers and scouts. He fell in a great debate with Vivec, for the warrior-poet alone could understand the northern man's two-layered speech, though ALMSIVI had to remain invisible during the argument.\nBARFOK, Maid of Planes, who appeared as a winged human with lick-encrusted spear, had the powers of Event Denouement. Battles fought against her would always end in victory for Barfok, because she could shape outcomes by singing. Four Chimeri villages and two more Dwemeri strongholds were destroyed by her decision enforcement. Vivec had to stuff her mouth with his milk finger to keep her from singing Veloth into ruin.\n&lt;a href=\"Ysmir\"&gt;YSMIR&lt;/a&gt;, the Dragon of the North, who always appears as a great bearded king, had powers innumerable and echoing. He was grim and dark and the most silent of the invading chieftains, though when he spoke villages were uplifted and thrown into the sea. The Hortator fought him unarmed, grabbing the &lt;a href=\"Dragons%20%28Lore%29\"&gt;Dragon&lt;/a&gt;'s roars by hand until Ysmir's power throat bled. These roars were given to Vivec to bind into an ebony listening frame, which the warrior-poet placed on Ysmir's face and ears to drive him mad and drive him away.\n'The coming forth and the driving away brings all things around. What I shall say next is unpleasant to record: &lt;a href=\"Herma-Mora\"&gt;HERMA-MORA&lt;/a&gt;-ALTADOON! AE ALTADOON!'\nThe ending of the words is &lt;a href=\"ALMSIVI\"&gt;ALMSIVI&lt;/a&gt;."}

Why do they lack the stomach for such work? They would take me from my family and the vocation granted me by my lineage, but they refuse to release me from this banal existence.\nI have asked them. Oh, how I've asked them. I've demanded, I've threatened, I've begged, for an end.\nThey will do nothing for me. And in my distress, I turn to the only person who's ever truly cared. I hear the master's voice incessantly now, and while I don't understand everything he says, I know he has my best interests at heart.\nAnd his advice? He wants me to become better. A better High Kinlord. He teaches me, and through him I've learned spells that will open a way to the master. So that my subjects can meet him, can be made better."}

Following his father's death, he led &lt;a href=\"the%20Crowns\"&gt;the Crowns&lt;/a&gt; against &lt;a href=\"Baron%20Volag\"&gt;Baron Volag&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;a href=\"Hammerfell%20Civil%20War\"&gt;Hammerfell Civil War&lt;/a&gt;, but was mortally wounded during the &lt;a href=\"Battle%20of%20Hunding%20Bay\"&gt;Battle of Hunding Bay&lt;/a&gt;.\nHistory.\nDuring &lt;a href=\"Tiber%20Septim\"&gt;Tiber Septim&lt;/a&gt;'s conquest of &lt;a href=\"Tamriel\"&gt;Tamriel&lt;/a&gt;, he invaded the homeland of the Redguards, Hammerfell. A'Tor, along with his father, initially bravely resisted Tiber's military advances. With Thassad's death, however, the &lt;a href=\"The%20Crowns\"&gt;Crowns&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Forebears\"&gt;Forebears&lt;/a&gt; split over the issue of independence from the &lt;a href=\"Septim%20Empire\"&gt;Septim Empire&lt;/a&gt;. Under A'Tor, the Crowns took a strong stance against joining with &lt;a href=\"Cyrodiil\"&gt;Cyrodiil&lt;/a&gt; and favored continued independence. Their rivals, the Forebears, however, wanted to gain the economic and military benefits associated with joining the Empire. Thus a civil war broke out.\nA'Tor, as King Thassad's heir, led the Crown war effort against the Forebears. Using tactics learned from his father and his generals, A'Tor was wildly successful in driving back the Forebears, defeating their leader &lt;a href=\"Baron%20Volag\"&gt;Baron Volag&lt;/a&gt; on numerous occasions. The young prince's military successes, however, also brought his downfall. The Forebears, fearing defeat, invited &lt;a href=\"Tiber%20Septim\"&gt;Tiber Septim&lt;/a&gt; to lead his &lt;a href=\"Imperial%20Legion\"&gt;Imperial Legion&lt;/a&gt;s in to stop the Crown advance. Heavily outnumbered and outsupplied, A'Tor's tactics no longer proved effective and his forces were driven back to the main Crown base on the island of &lt;a href=\"Stros%20M%27kai\"&gt;Stros M'kai&lt;/a&gt;. In the ensuing &lt;a href=\"Battle%20of%20Hunding%20Bay\"&gt;battle&lt;/a&gt;, A'Tor and the majority of his warriors were defeated by the Imperial Legion under Admiral &lt;a href=\"Amiel%20Richton\"&gt;Amiel Richton&lt;/a&gt;. A'Tor was killed by a poisoned arrow of the assassin &lt;a href=\"Dram\"&gt;Dram&lt;/a&gt;.\nA'Tor's soul was then put into a &lt;a href=\"Soul%20Gem%20%28Redguard%29\"&gt;soul gem&lt;/a&gt;. This soul gem was fashioned into an &lt;a href=\"Amulet%20%28Redguard%29\"&gt;amulet&lt;/a&gt; and came into &lt;a href=\"N%27Gasta\"&gt;N'Gasta&lt;/a&gt;'s possession. &lt;a href=\"Cyrus%20%28Redguard%29\"&gt;Cyrus&lt;/a&gt; took a job offer to deliver the amulet from N'Gasta to Amiel Richton in exchange for information about his sister, &lt;a href=\"Iszara\"&gt;Iszara&lt;/a&gt;. When returning the amulet, Richton denied knowing any info on Iszara prompting Cyrus to threaten him, resulting in his imprisonment. The soul gem was then put in the treasure vaults and put under guard by the &lt;a href=\"Dragons%20%28Lore%29\"&gt;dragon&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Nafaalilargus\"&gt;Nafaalilargus&lt;/a&gt;. Cyrus escaped and managed to find his sister. He then learned that the amulet was actually a soul gem and set out to retrieve it. He killed Nafaalilargus and took the soul gem from the vaults.\nA'Tor's body, however, was saved by his battlemages and the priests of Arkay, where it was being kept in the &lt;a href=\"Temple%20of%20Arkay%20%28Redguard%29\"&gt;Temple of Arkay&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href=\"Saban\"&gt;Saban&lt;/a&gt; then took the soul gem and used a spell to attempt to resurrect Prince A'Tor's body with it. The spell worked, but the prince instead chose to have his soul enchant his sword. This sword became known as the &lt;a href=\"Soul%20Sword\"&gt;Soul Sword&lt;/a&gt; and contained Prince A'Tor's mind and spirit. The sword could think and move on its own and guided Cyrus to his former palace. Cyrus used the sword in combat against the guards, Dram, and Amiel Richton. After defeated Richton, Cyrus was tricked and forced to drop the soul sword. The soul sword then flew up and stabbed Richton and Dram.\nFollowing the defeat of the Empire on the island, the soul sword then came into possession of Iszara."}

They are tasked with traveling to &lt;a href=\"Kynesgrove%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Kynesgrove&lt;/a&gt; with Delphine to kill the dragon &lt;a href=\"Sahloknir\"&gt;Sahloknir&lt;/a&gt; after being resurrected from his burial mound by &lt;a href=\"Alduin%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Alduin&lt;/a&gt; after which Delphine will trust the Dragonborn with her identity as a &lt;a href=\"Blades\"&gt;Blade&lt;/a&gt; and invite them to assist in investigating the resurgence of dragons.\nBackground.\n\"Delphine, the innkeeper in Riverwood, is more than she seems. She was the one that left me the note in Ustengrav. She gave me back the Horn of Jurgen Windcaller. She went to a lot of trouble to get my attention. I should find out what she wants.\"\nWalkthrough.\nAfter renting the attic room in the &lt;a href=\"Sleeping%20Giant%20Inn\"&gt;Sleeping Giant Inn&lt;/a&gt; from Delphine (for which no gold is necessary, but 10 gold will be taken from the Dragonborn if they possess it), the Dragonborn will be spoken to by her and given the &lt;a href=\"Horn%20of%20Jurgen%20Windcaller\"&gt;Horn of Jurgen Windcaller&lt;/a&gt;, which they were seeking in the prerequisite quest \"&lt;a href=\"The%20Horn%20of%20Jurgen%20Windcaller\"&gt;The Horn of Jurgen Windcaller&lt;/a&gt;,\" after which the quest will begin.\nSleeping Giant Inn.\nDelphine will lead the Dragonborn to a room across the inn. She will ask them to close the door before they can proceed any further. After doing so, she will open a secret passage in the back of a wardrobe that leads down to a subterranean room. There, she will reveal that she took the Horn to attract the attention of the Dragonborn. The note was a safeguard to protect against trickery by the &lt;a href=\"Thalmor%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Thalmor&lt;/a&gt;. She will also explain that &lt;a href=\"Dragons%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;dragons&lt;/a&gt; are being resurrected and, after further inquiry, will reveal that she is under the impression that the &lt;a href=\"Thalmor%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Thalmor&lt;/a&gt; are responsible. In order for Delphine to trust the Dragonborn further she needs to know with certainty that they are, in fact, a Dragonborn and will only be certain if she witnesses them absorb the soul of a deceased dragon. She believes that the next dragon to come back to life will do so east of the town of Kynesgrove according to a &lt;a href=\"Map%20of%20Dragon%20Burials\"&gt;dragon burial map&lt;/a&gt; based off of the &lt;a href=\"Dragonstone\"&gt;Dragonstone&lt;/a&gt; the Dragonborn recovered from &lt;a href=\"Bleak%20Falls%20Barrow%20%28Location%29\"&gt;Bleak Falls Barrow&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;a href=\"Bleak%20Falls%20Barrow%20%28Quest%29\"&gt;quest of the same name&lt;/a&gt;. She will then give the Dragonborn the choice to either travel to Kynesgrove together or go there individually. Before she departs, she will change from her regular clothes into a set of &lt;a href=\"Leather%20Armor%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;leather armor&lt;/a&gt;, and tell &lt;a href=\"Orgnar\"&gt;Orgnar&lt;/a&gt; that he is in charge of the inn while she is traveling and Orgnar will wish her good luck on her journey. From here, the Dragonborn should make their way to Kynesgrove, located in &lt;a href=\"Eastmarch%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Eastmarch&lt;/a&gt;, south of &lt;a href=\"Windhelm%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Windhelm&lt;/a&gt;.\nI'd like to rent a room. (10 gold) \"Next to the door, the room on the left.\"\n\"So you're the Dragonborn I've been hearing so much about. I think you're looking for this. We need to talk. Follow me.\"\n\"The Greybeards seem to think you're Dragonborn. I hope they're right.\"\nKynesgrove.\nUpon reaching Kynesgrove, Alduin will be flying over the grave. A distraught resident of the town, &lt;a href=\"Iddra\"&gt;Iddra&lt;/a&gt;, will approach the Dragonborn warning of the attacking dragon:\n\"No, you don't want to go up there! A dragon... it's attacking!\"\nAfter speaking with Iddra, the Dragonborn should travel up the hill towards Alduin. They can also proceed directly to the dragon burial mound without speaking to Iddra, but will be forced into conversation if she is in close proximity.\nAlduin is performing a process to bring a dragon back to life and cannot be killed or injured at this time. During this time, the skeletal form of Sahloknir will emerge from the burial mound and will regenerate its musculature and scales while Alduin finishes the resurrection process. Alduin will then proceed to instruct the dragon to kill the Dragonborn and Delphine and leave the area, but only after he and Sahloknir notice the Dragonborn and Alduin taunts them before giving Sahloknir his instructions to kill them.\nSahloknir and Alduin will engage in a lengthy conversation during and after the resurrection, even addressing the Dragonborn themselves before combat occurs, and rushing into combat will cause this dialogue to be skipped.\nAlduin: \"\"\nAlduin uses the Shout to shatter the stone lid on Sahloknir's burial mound, allowing Sahloknir to emerge with a roar and step out before turning his attention to Alduin as his body rejuvenates over his skeleton:\nSahloknir: \"\"\nAlduin: \" You do not even know our tongue, do you? Such arrogance, to dare take for yourself the name of Dovah. \"\nA follower, along with Delphine, will be useful for distracting Sahloknir. This fight can be made easier by attacking Sahloknir before he has been fully revived by Alduin. This will ensure that Sahloknir is damaged before he takes flight, which he will do immediately when combat begins. If is installed, &lt;a href=\"Durnehviir\"&gt;Durnehviir&lt;/a&gt; can be summoned as a means to aid in the fight against Sahloknir. As Sahloknir uses flame-based magic attacks, such as his &lt;a href=\"Fire%20Breath%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Fire Breath&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Thu%27um\"&gt;Thu'um&lt;/a&gt;, in addition to melee attacks when on the ground, potions of resist fire and resist magic will prove to be useful for negating damage as well as alteration-based shields, restoration-based wards, and resist fire or resist magic armor enchantments. While Sahloknir is in flight, the only effective weapons will be ranged magic and bows and arrows and it can be difficult to land a successful hit. The best opportunity to deal damage will be when Sahloknir has landed and vulnerable to melee attacks.\nAfter killing Sahloknir and absorbing his soul, talk to Delphine. The quest \"&lt;a href=\"Diplomatic%20Immunity\"&gt;Diplomatic Immunity&lt;/a&gt;\" will begin, requiring the Dragonborn to make a choice to\u00a0either go with her back to the Sleeping Giant Inn in &lt;a href=\"Riverwood%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Riverwood&lt;/a&gt; or meet her there later. The Dragonborn can enquire further with her about the Blades and the Thalmor.\n\"I owe you some answers, don't I? Go ahead. Whatever you want to know. Nothing held back.\"\nWho are you and what do you want with me? \"I'm one of the last members of the Blades. A very long time ago the Blades were dragonslayers, and we served the Dragonborn, the greatest dragonslayer. For the last two hundred years, since the last Dragonborn emperor, the Blades have been searching for a purpose. Now that dragons are back, our purpose is clear again. We need to stop them.\"\nDelphine's disposition with the Dragonborn will also increase to 3 (ally). At this point, the quest will be complete and dragons will randomly spawn in the overworld at any time and actively attack the Dragonborn, not just at the dragon lairs located around Skyrim."}

I know this, but so too do I know what truths our past may hold. My devotion to the Father of Mysteries has been unyielding, spring-loaded I've even been told, but for so long incomplete. I began to ask questions, and was surprised so few knew. Where did our Lord come from? I received a name, but not an answer.\n&lt;a href=\"Ald%20Sotha%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Ald Sotha&lt;/a&gt;.\nI was quick to find my own answers, not within the cautious words of others but in the honest pages of books. My first discovery is that all information I would find was of the Ald Sotha that was, for the town was destroyed long ago. It was the homestead of the minor House Sotha, and how strange to write the word minor with any regard to my Lord's name! But from all my research I can only conclude such, as they are known for no great deeds or any particular skill. An unremarkable town belonging to an unremarkable family, yet somehow the birthplace of the very Father of Mysteries.\nAld Sotha was destroyed sometime within the &lt;a href=\"First%20Era\"&gt;First Era&lt;/a&gt; by the &lt;a href=\"Daedric%20Princes\"&gt;Daedric Prince&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Mehrunes%20Dagon\"&gt;Mehrunes Dagon&lt;/a&gt;. There's very little speculation as to why the Prince of Destruction wished to eradicate this town, and I don't believe there needs to be. Why try to piece together the reasoning behind a being of chaos? The result is still the same, and that is the death of everyone living within Ald Sotha. Everyone, that is, but Lord Seht, rescued by Lord &lt;a href=\"Vivec\"&gt;Vivec&lt;/a&gt; before either of them had obtained true godhood.\nVivec's rescue is worth further insight, however. How did Lord Seht survive through the attack? There is no mention of a battle, and from what I have analyzed I can only assume that it was after Dagon's destruction that our Lord Seht was rescued. I can only speculate in that end. If the &lt;a href=\"Tribunal%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Tribunal&lt;/a&gt; wished for others to know, they would have shared the tale. And you certainly won't see me tugging at one of their sleeves, asking such trivial questions!\nAnd, once again, the end result is the same. Lord Seht was rescued, raised by Lord Vivec, and eventually ascended to his rightful place as our Clockwork God. Whatever manner he was saved by Dagon's wrath, it was the fate of the divine gears which move us for him to live, and guide us to reclaim our lost heritage, &lt;a href=\"Tamriel\"&gt;Tamriel&lt;/a&gt; Final."}

The Wayrest Breton, with this monstrous crested beast in tow, shouted at me from across the counter at our stall. He demanded that I return his gold, with an added gratuity, because this creature ate his fine silk shirts. Apparently this monster, now the size of a large tusked bull, liked to butt up against the supports of the Breton's house and nearly knocked it down.\nLucky for me, the magistrate decided the dispute in my favor: \"Let the buyer beware.\"\nWhatever this beast is, you are a fool for sending one to me. Please do not send another.\nLove and kisses,\nYour Sister\nP.S. Feel free to send more gold though."}

Deciding to further investigate, Tivela used the spare key she swore to use only in special emergencies to get inside the studio. Rythe Lythandas, she says, was nowhere to be found.

This brush was given to Rythe by its first owner, his father. It was stolen by a &lt;a href=\"Bosmer%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;Bosmer&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Thief%20%28Class%29\"&gt;thief&lt;/a&gt; who disappeared into the painting and created some &lt;a href=\"Painted%20Troll%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;Painted Troll&lt;/a&gt;s to protect him. Instead, they killed him, and now lurk inside the painting.\nThe only way back to &lt;a href=\"Tamriel\"&gt;Tamriel&lt;/a&gt; is to retrieve the brush from the thief's body. If they choose to ask Rythe about the trolls, he will give them six bottles of &lt;a href=\"turpentine\"&gt;turpentine&lt;/a&gt;, which inflict extra damage to painted trolls. There are six trolls in the forest.\nThe path to the thief's body is a linear one in a horseshoe shape; Most of the trolls can be avoided altogether by jumping over the rocks between Rythe and the thief's body.\nOnce the &lt;a href=\"Brush%20of%20True%20Paint\"&gt;Brush of True Paint&lt;/a&gt; is retrieved, return to Rythe and he will paint a door back to Tamriel.\nOnce Rythe returns home, Rythe will go to his wife to let Tivela know he is safe.

Have they nothing better to do than to ape the witless Prince Hubalajad, who is enamored of elaborate hairstyles?\nThe Highness of the High Hair has appeared in public with numerous elaborate (and, to the common man, utterly ridiculous) hairstyles. Whether they are wigs, or his own natural hair tortured into ludicrous designs, matters not. We have people starving in the alleys, or homeless due to the sinking of some sections of our city, while Prince of the Curious Coifs pays his hairdresser a sum of 100 gold pieces for each work of \"art.\"\nHis most recent follicular follies include:\nA representation of the &lt;a href=\"White-Gold%20Tower%20%28Online%29\"&gt;White-Gold Tower&lt;/a&gt;, adorned with diamonds to represent lighted windows.

The stunningly ridiculous effect was only enhanced with tern excrement, when one of the birds flew over his head, narrowly missing the mainsail.\nFor a recent outing, it was seen that Prince Hew's Hair was artfully arranged as a &lt;a href=\"Haj%20Mota\"&gt;haj mota&lt;/a&gt; about to charge. Rumor has it that the scales of the \"hair-beast\" were individual rubies of uniform size. The beast's eyes were emeralds. One young maiden was so alarmed by the horror on His Hairness' head that she fainted. Her parents quickly blamed the heat, not the Hair-Mota, so as not to displease Prince Hew. However the young woman was overheard later saying that the emerald eyes kept staring at her until she was quite undone.\nPeople of Abah's Landing, I implore you! Rise up against the Prince's Hair!"}

Opening up our borders was not a decision to take lightly. I too feared the dire implications such an act would have on our beloved homeland. Would our cities be infested with fleas? Would our children be stolen from their beds at night? Fellow citizens, I assure you, I had just as many concerns about the safety of our proud Summerset as you.\nAs a Kinlord, I had the great privilege of voicing these concerns to the very court of Summerset, and often found myself in the middle of the hotly debated topic. It was unprecedented, madness of the wildest kind! I was determined to put a stop to the desecration of our beloved homeland. I too felt as though we were betraying our ancestor's wishes. Yes, my fellow citizens, I did adamantly oppose the very idea of opening our borders to these outsiders, cats and cannibals that I knew to be unworthy.\nThen something changed. I changed. Please, allow me to tell you why I now wholeheartedly support the queen's decree. Allow me to plead the rights of those who are now our allies and neighbors.\nThis change started with the stories I heard of the war effort, of that I am certain. A narrow victory, only assured by the archery support provided by the &lt;a href=\"Bosmer%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Wood Elves&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href=\"Khajiit%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Khajiit&lt;/a&gt; agents who learned decisive secrets through clever subterfuge. Even looking at simply the numbers of our forces, no matter our military expertise and strength, I knew it was impossible to fight this war alone. Still, I was adamant. Our tentative associates need only serve us on the front line. What need had we for them here in Summerset?\nI was set in my ways, and I felt that nothing could sway me. It was only when the unimaginable happened that I saw the truth.\nAndimeril, my shining star and only son, fell upon the battlefield. How often I think back to the night he left. If only perhaps I had been less stubborn. If only I hadn't bitten my tongue out of spite. If only I could have found the right words to convince him to stay. He was young and foolhardy, and far braver than I have ever been. The very thought that I'll never see his face again still tightens my chest so painfully I can barely breath.\nI did not learn of my son's death through courier or friend. No, I found out when a young Wood Elf stood before me, boots caked in mud and eyes filled with tears. In her hands was a plain, metal box, and I knew before she even spoke that my son's ashes were inside it. Her name was Grenith.\n\"He never asked me to do this,\" she said as her tears began to fall. \"In fact, he always said he was never coming back. But I just couldn't bear the thought, you know? He deserved to come home.\"\nBefore that day I had never even spoken to a member of another race, never looked into the eyes of those who I had always believed were so much lower than myself. It was then that I could no longer deny what was happening. That day my eyes were finally opened to the truth, not through debate or decree, but simply from that shared sorrow I felt with Grenith. So painful it had to be real.\nThe allies who we think so little of are dying with our sons and daughters, every day. They share meals, exchange stories, try to find laughter and comfort when they can. They fight side-by-side, entrusting each other with their lives. This is the reality of their daily battle, far from our tranquil shores.\nGrenith told me about the last weeks of Andimeril's life. Perhaps it was only to comfort a grieving old mer, but she had nothing but admiration for my son. Her words of his bravery and kindness gave me a solemn comfort. My son died standing up for the ideals he believed in. To me, a letter from our queen herself would not have honored Andimeril more than the kind words of his fellow soldier.\nHow selfish the thought is even now, but this comfort would not have been possible without our open borders. The honor that Grenith showed to my family would never have happened. She would have been treated just as I always believed her kind should be treated, as inferior, as unworthy. Without her, Andimeril would never have found his way back home, but rather remained as an unknown corpse on some distant battlefield. I would never have gotten the honor of putting my son to rest.\nMy fellow citizens, these other races deserve nothing but our respect. If my personal story in no way moves you, please, I implore you to speak to them. Buy them a drink at your local tavern, invite them into your home for a meal. As a culture of scholars, we must open our minds and learn. Do so and I assure you, you'll find cultures that are vastly different, often shockingly so, but just as rich as our own.\nDon't close your minds as we once sealed our borders. Our future depends on the ability to move forward. Take that first step with me, my fellow citizens. Soon you'll find yourself walking toward tomorrow."}

Brynjolf can initially be found during daytime or nighttime. He can be most commonly found in The Bee and Barb or walking around the marketplace, manning his stall where he promotes his Falmerblood Elixir scam.\n\"Never done an honest day's work in your life for all that coin you're carrying, hey \"\"?\" *\nI'm sorry, what? \nWhen the Dragonborn is ready, they should tell Brynjolf between 8AM and 8PM to begin the job.

Wait until I start the distraction and then show me what you're made of.\"\nNot stealing or failing.\nFailing to plant the ring on Brand-Shei will have the bonus of preserving him as a vendor with gold supply. This may be advantageous to a lower level character, or anyone without higher level &lt;a href=\"speech\"&gt;speech&lt;/a&gt; perks. He also has a quest \"&lt;a href=\"Distant%20Memories\"&gt;Distant Memories&lt;/a&gt;,\" if it was not already completed.\nJust because the Dovahkiin does not complete the assignment, it does not in any way affect the Dragonborn's involvement in the Thieves Guild quest line. Brynjolf will express disappointment, but will state that he believes the Dragonborn still shows potential. The following scenarios are possible:\nIn any scenario above, the Dragonborn will return to Brynjolf without getting paid and continue the quest-line while keeping Brand-Shei as a &lt;a href=\"Merchants%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;vendor&lt;/a&gt;.

He will tell you that the inhabitants of the estate have all gone missing, including his betrothed, &lt;a href=\"Arlie%20Edrald\"&gt;Arlie Edrald&lt;/a&gt;. He will ask for your help in uncovering what happened. \nHead for the central manor and start your search there. You will find several clues throughout the building. in the bedroom on the second floor, you will find \"&lt;a href=\"Krisandra%20Edrald%27s%20Journal%2C%20Vol.%203\"&gt;Krisandra Edrald's Journal, Vol. 3&lt;/a&gt;\". This is the journal of Arlie's mother, which mentions that Arlie was growing close to the servant &lt;a href=\"Dulkhi\"&gt;Dulkhi&lt;/a&gt; and that Krisandra thought something nefarious was up. It then talks about her preparing something nefarious to get rid of the servant. Upon reading this, Federic will tell you to go and search the servant's quarters. These quarters are northeast of the manor. Inside, you will find &lt;a href=\"Dulkhi%27s%20Diary\"&gt;a diary&lt;/a&gt; lying on her bed. Federic will immediately run over and grab it; speak with him and he will tell you that the journal mentions Dulkhi and Arlie meeting up at the windmill, which was also a special place to Arlie and Federic. The journal further says that Arlie's mother was hiding out there, which Federic finds suspicious as she never went out there. Federic then gives you the diary and asks you to come with him to the windmill. If you read the diary, you will see that Dulkhi clearly had romantic feelings towards Arlie.\nAt the windmill, search for clues. There will be a number of quest markers over certain containers and items, including \"&lt;a href=\"Krisandra%20Edrald%27s%20Journal%2C%20Vol.%201\"&gt;Krisandra Edrald's Journal, Vol. 1&lt;/a&gt;\", but the important one is the Unusual Key found in the toolbox on the second floor balcony. Upon taking it, Federic will remark that it is the key to the manor's undercroft. Head there and investigate. At the entrance, you will find \"&lt;a href=\"Krisandra%20Edrald%27s%20Journal%2C%20Vol.%202\"&gt;Krisandra Edrald's Journal, Vol. 2&lt;/a&gt;\". It will mention that she is performing a ritual to &lt;a href=\"Mehrunes%20Dagon\"&gt;Mehrunes Dagon&lt;/a&gt; so as to save Arlie's marriage to Federic and get rid of Dulkhi. Further on, you will see what looks like a defunct &lt;a href=\"Oblivion%20Gates\"&gt;Oblivion Gate&lt;/a&gt; as well as a table with a \"&lt;a href=\"Tome%20of%20Daedric%20Portals\"&gt;Tome of Daedric Portals&lt;/a&gt;\". Read the tome; it will detail how to open a portal to the &lt;a href=\"Deadlands\"&gt;Deadlands&lt;/a&gt;. After that, use the Basins of Flame, Water and Earth placed throughout the chamber to activate the oblivion gate. The correct order is to first use the Basin of Flame, then the Basin of Earth and lastly the Basin of Water, as can be determined from the tome. \nAfter you've succesfully opened the portal, head through to the Deadlands. You will find Dulkhi and Arlie on the other side; speak with Arlie and she will tell you that they managed to overpower their captors but that her parents are still trapped. She will ask you to go look for her parents and save them from this awful place. Arlie will stay behind to be with Federic, but Dulkhi will come with you to fight the daedra. &lt;a href=\"Allan%20Edrald\"&gt;Allan Edrald&lt;/a&gt; will be to the east. After you have rescued him, head to the south of the area to save &lt;a href=\"Krisandra%20Edrald\"&gt;Krisandra Edrald&lt;/a&gt;. Upon being freed, she will admit that she is responsible for all this, and will tell you that there is a sigil stone here that is attuned to their manor. She will ask you to destroy that sigil stone so that once everyone gets sent back to tamriel and the oblivion gate gets closed for good. The stone is in the big ruin to your north, but it is guarded by &lt;a href=\"Velark\"&gt;Velark&lt;/a&gt;, who can be quite powerful. After she is dead, destroy the sigil stone and you will be transported back to Tamriel.\nBack in Tamriel, speak with Federic and he will ask you what he should do with his future. You can either tell him to stay here with Arlie or to go and travel the world like you. If you tell him to stay, . If you tell him to head out, he will say that once things have settled down here, he is going to join the Wayrest Guard to become stronger and then return as this family's protector. Either way, you should then head upstairs and talk to Dulkhi. Dulkhi says that since her presence causes problems for Arlie, she should peobably leave. You can then either tell her to head out or to stay. If you tell her to head out, . If you tell her to stay, she will come to her senses and realise that Arlie needs her now more than ever. Finally, head outside and speak with Arlie to finish the quest. If you told either Federic or Dulkhi to leave, there will then be a scene in which they come to say goodbye to Arlie."}

Gargak will be standing at the stairs; talk to him and he will tell you that he was supposed to be chief, but his brother challenged him to a duel for that position and cheated his way to victory. \nAfter speaking to the Chief's brother, the &lt;a href=\"Vestige\"&gt;Vestige&lt;/a&gt; will receive a choice: they can choose whether to tell them to challenge their brother to leadership of the &lt;a href=\"Barkbite%20Clan\"&gt;Barkbite Clan&lt;/a&gt;, or to start a new clan where he is.\nIf the former option is chosen, . If the latter option is chosen, you will be asked to investigate a nearby &lt;a href=\"Abandoned%20Iron%20Mine\"&gt;Abandoned Iron Mine&lt;/a&gt;.

In the mine, you will meet with Gargak's ally Rakhaz; speak with her and she will tell you to go look for ore. You will find the ore you need on the far side of the mine, in an ore vein tucked away in the corner. Rakhaz will confirm that this is iron ore, and that it will do for Gargak's purposes. \nTake the ore back to Gargak to finish the quest."}

The people of Evermore need help, and they need hope. Reachmen have taken over the lighthouse south of Evermore, but &lt;a href=\"Guard%20Captain%20Hjurrun\"&gt;Guard Captain Hjurrun&lt;/a&gt; has ordered the guards to hold back. I've agreed to attack the Reachmen and bring their leaders head.\nWalkthrough.\nAt the gates to &lt;a href=\"Evermore%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Evermore&lt;/a&gt;, you will run into a guardsman named &lt;a href=\"Sergeant%20Antieve\"&gt;Sergeant Antieve&lt;/a&gt;.

The guard have orders to stand back and await how the situation unfolds, but since you are not part of the guard, Antieve will ask you to strike out at the Reachmen and kill their leader, &lt;a href=\"Strastnoc\"&gt;Strastnoc&lt;/a&gt;. \nHead over south to the lighthouse at &lt;a href=\"Strastnoc%27s%20Landing\"&gt;Strastnoc's Landing&lt;/a&gt;. Strastnoc will be in the lighthouse building; kill him there and take his head. Once you have this trophy, head back to town and give it to &lt;a href=\"Captain%20Hjurrun\"&gt;Captain Hjurrun&lt;/a&gt; to prove that you killed the enemy commander. He will congratulate you on your kill, and will tell you that the Duke will want to see you. \nHead to Evermore Keep. Before you enter, an orc named &lt;a href=\"Glarikha\"&gt;Glarikha&lt;/a&gt; will ask to have a word with you. Speak with her and she will tell you that she is contacting you on behalf of &lt;a href=\"Queen%20Arzhela\"&gt;Queen Arzhela&lt;/a&gt;. The queen wishes to gather information on the city's defenses, but cannot publicly go against the Duke. Glarikha will ask you to do three things: she will ask you to investigate the defenses at the east gate, speak to the former captain of the watch &lt;a href=\"Sir%20Jarnot\"&gt;Sir Jarnot&lt;/a&gt; about the city's defensive strategy and investigate why a refugee has been put in the stocks. These objectives can be completed in any order.\nThe stocks are down the road to your south. You will find a man named &lt;a href=\"Imrazan\"&gt;Imrazan&lt;/a&gt; in these stocks; speak with him and he will tell you that he came here from the city of &lt;a href=\"Hallin%27s%20Stand\"&gt;Hallin's Stand&lt;/a&gt;, which has been overrun by &lt;a href=\"Imperial%20Legion%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Imperial&lt;/a&gt; troops. When he spread the word that the Imperials might come here next, he was arrested for spreading paranoia and half-truths. After you are done speaking with him, a strange talking crow will appear. The crow will reiterate that the real threat to the region is coming from the south, but will provide little more information. Next, head for the east gate; you will find a mysterious crate just outside. The crates will be filled with weapons from a ship called the Bjoulsae Queen. Upon finding the crate, another crow will appear; it will tell you that these weapons are not the gift the city needs. Lastly, head for the &lt;a href=\"Anchor%27s%20Point%20Inn\"&gt;Anchor's Point Inn&lt;/a&gt; and speak with Sir Jarnot there. He will tell you that Captain Hjurrun has been turning down those who have offered to help the city, including the Fighters Guild. He will ask you to talk to the nearby crow for more information though; speak to this third crow and it will tell you that there are secrets being hidden from the light. \n\"&lt;The defenses at the south gate are far from impressive, but they're as well organized as might be expected. There are, however, a few suspicious-looking crates.&gt;\"\nOnce you have completed all of the assignments, head to &lt;a href=\"St.%20Pelin%27s%20Chapel\"&gt;St. Pelin's Chapel&lt;/a&gt; south of the inn and speak with Queen Arzhela there. She will tell you that Glarikha was not actually acting on her behalf, and will tell you to report all security issues to the duke. Head back to &lt;a href=\"Evermore%20Castle\"&gt;Evermore Castle&lt;/a&gt;; you will witness a conversation between &lt;a href=\"Duke%20Renchant\"&gt;Duke Renchant&lt;/a&gt; and Captain Hjurrun; once they are done talking, speak with the Duke. He will explain why they turned down the Fighters Guild and why they put Imrazan in the stocks, but will avoid telling you why there are weapons at the east gate. He will tell you that it has something to do with an ally he found to protect the city from the Reachmen; you can persuade him into telling you that he struck a deal with the Imperials. If you do not persuade him, . \nSince you do not have any incriminating evidence against the duke, you cannot currently publicly accuse him of selling out the city to the imperials. Therefore, you should head to the ship these weapons were transported on, the \"Bjoulsae Queen.\" Said ship can be found in the docks; once you board it, the captain will ask you why you are intruding here. At this point, you can talk to the captain or to the strange crow on the deck. The crow will tell you that the key to the ship's interior can be found on one of the sailors on the shore, by the south city wall. &lt;a href=\"Captain%20Ahnu\"&gt;Captain Ahnu&lt;/a&gt; will refuse to let you into the cargo hold, but she can be intimidated into giving you the key. \nOnce you have a key, head below deck. the &lt;a href=\"Bjoulsae%20Queen%20Deckhand\"&gt;deckhands&lt;/a&gt; here will be hostile, so be prepared to defend yourself. In the room on the west end, you will find an imprisoned Glarikha; free her and she will ask you to find some solid proof that the Duke is planning to hand the city to the Imperials. Said proof can be found on the other side of the ship; there will be &lt;a href=\"Cipius%27%20Orders\"&gt;a note&lt;/a&gt; on the table detailing the Imperial plans; they have infiltrated the city with their spies and are looking to take over. With this note in hand, seek out Glarikha in the docks. She will tell you that the ship's captain just left the docks in a hurry; she will ask you to spy on her. Head to the alley to the south and hide behind the inconspicuous rock there; you will overhear a conversation between the ship's captain and Captain Hjurrun; Hjurrun is in on the plot. \nOnce you have found out about all this, head to the Chapel and inform Queen Arzhela to finish the quest and start the next one, \"&lt;a href=\"Imperial%20Infiltration\"&gt;Imperial Infiltration&lt;/a&gt;.\""}

The Shattered Masque has fought far too many opponents who fail to realize the importance of proper footwear.\nThis basic primer will to (sic) teach you how to make a simple pair of homespun shoes. If we're to face each other in the &lt;a href=\"Blessed%20Crucible\"&gt;Blessed Crucible&lt;/a&gt;, I want you to fall because of my unmatched skill - not your pathetic foot stitching.\nStep 1: Acquire Jute.\n&lt;a href=\"Raw%20Jute\"&gt;Raw Jute&lt;/a&gt; is cheap, plentiful, and easy to weave. Look for the distinctive yellow flowers in the wild. I suppose you could pay someone to pick them for you, and it's that kind of laziness I look forward to punishing in the arena.\nStep 2: Refine Cloth.\nYou can work with raw jute at any &lt;a href=\"Clothing%20Station\"&gt;clothing station&lt;/a&gt;. Professional clothiers call this process \"refinement,\" which can be done with any raw material. For now, you'll need ten raw jute plants to make the refined jute you'll need for shoes.\nUnless working a loom is beneath you.\nWeakling.\nStep 3: Style!\nClothiers from all across Tamriel have their own cultural style. You need style to make an impression in the dueling ring, so find the style material that's easiest for you to work. If you're an &lt;a href=\"Imperials%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Imperial&lt;/a&gt;, start with material for the Imperial style. Purchase it from clothiers or take them from your whimpering, defeated enemies.\nStep 4: Craft Your Shoes.\nBring your style material and five bolts of jute to a clothing station. (Remember - refined jute, not raw jute plants.) Now, get to work and craft yourself a pair of homespun shoes. You can use more bolts for better qualityshoes, but you you should start with five bolts.\nEasy work! As easy as it will be for me to crush your pathetic and deluded hopes of winning the &lt;a href=\"Brimstone%20Crown\"&gt;Brimstone Crown&lt;/a&gt;.\nMaking Clothes the Shattered Masque Way.\nAny Arena fighter worth their salt doesn't stop with a simple pair of shoes. Try making a pair of &lt;a href=\"Rawhide%20Boots\"&gt;rawhide boots&lt;/a&gt; for added protection, or a colorful sash to make you stand out in the ring. If you get the hang of this clothier business, you'll even have a trade to fall back upon after I thoroughly humiliate you in front of everyone you've ever loved.\nImproving Your Shoes.\nThe art of improving the shoes you make - or any other bit of clothing, really - requires you to work with &lt;a href=\"tannin\"&gt;tannin&lt;/a&gt;s at a clothing station. If you aren't careful, you'll ruin the clothing and the tannins in the process. Use as many tannins as you think you'll need.\nFind them on your own. I wont make everything easy for you.\nDeconstruction.\nMaybe you're the kind of person who cuts corners. If you don't have time to collect raw materials, you can always deconstruct clothing you no longer need. This will destroy the clothing, but maybe you'll salvage enough to make a hat I can knock off your head.\nResearching Traits.\nBy now you're thinking, \"I'll need an edge if I'm going to dare to fight the Shattered Masque.\" You could always research unique traits of items made by better clothiers than you by taking their clothing apart and studying their techniques. Anything to boost your confidence long enough for me to stomp it into dust."}

Access the Ratway Warrens by traveling through several areas, including the Ratway, &lt;a href=\"The%20Ragged%20Flagon\"&gt;The Ragged Flagon&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"The%20Ratway%20Vaults\"&gt;The Ratway Vaults&lt;/a&gt;. The Ratway's main entrance is located on the south end and lower level of Riften.\nBrynjolf, if not spoken to already, will be located in town during the day and at &lt;a href=\"The%20Bee%20and%20Barb\"&gt;The Bee and Barb&lt;/a&gt; at night. Talking to Brynjolf at the Bee and Barb will trigger conversation leading to the &lt;a href=\"Thieves%20Guild%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Thieves Guild&lt;/a&gt; quest line. If the Dragonborn has already become a member of the Thieves Guild, they can talk to Brynjolf or &lt;a href=\"Vekel%20the%20Man\"&gt;Vekel the Man&lt;/a&gt; inside &lt;a href=\"The%20Ragged%20Flagon%20-%20Cistern\"&gt;The Ragged Flagon - Cistern&lt;/a&gt; to advance to the next part of the quest.\nAlternatively, talking to &lt;a href=\"Keerava\"&gt;Keerava&lt;/a&gt;, the barmaid of the Bee and Barb, can give the Dragonborn the information without putting the question to Brynjolf, although this will bypass the introduction to the Thieves Guild. Once inside the Ragged Flagon, talk to Vekel about Esbern. He will not give information about Esbern unless the Dragonborn has a high &lt;a href=\"Persuasion\"&gt;Persuasion&lt;/a&gt;, 140 , or beats him in a &lt;a href=\"brawl\"&gt;brawl&lt;/a&gt;. Then, he will give Esbern's location and warn of Thalmor looking for him as well.\nAfter meeting with Brynjolf and mentioning Esbern, he will give information that Esbern is in the Ratways, and the quest marker will update accordingly. There have been problems reported with quest advancement if the quest \"&lt;a href=\"A%20Chance%20Arrangement\"&gt;A Chance Arrangement&lt;/a&gt;\" has also been picked up. \"A Cornered Rat\" can progress \"after\" completing \"A Chance Arrangement\" or \"after\" being caught. Brynjolf then will ask the Dragonborn if they want to join the Thieves Guild (if this hasn't been done already), and a new quest will start. The slot on Esbern's door will be closed, and conversation with Esbern is not possible if the quest has not advanced properly.\nRatway.\nSome events in the Ratway may unfold differently depending on certain events during \"&lt;a href=\"Diplomatic%20Immunity\"&gt;Diplomatic Immunity&lt;/a&gt;.\"\nIf this is the first time inside the Ratway, there will be a few enemies to fight through to get to the headquarters of the Thieves Guild. If already a member of the Thieves Guild, the Dragonborn may enter through the secret entrance in the Riften graveyard.\nIf the Dragonborn did not kill a man named &lt;a href=\"Gissur\"&gt;Gissur&lt;/a&gt; during \"Diplomatic Immunity,\" it is possible to be attacked by him outside the entrance to the Ragged Flagon. Inside, after the attack, Gissur may be identified by Guild members and killed. The Dragonborn can take &lt;a href=\"Gissur%27s%20Note\"&gt;Gissur's Note&lt;/a&gt; from his body. The note may also be found in the Ratway without the body. If Gissur was killed at the Thalmor Embassy, he will not appear during this quest. Alternatively, the Dragonborn may encounter a female &lt;a href=\"Khajiit%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Khajiit&lt;/a&gt; assassin named &lt;a href=\"Shavari\"&gt;Shavari&lt;/a&gt;. \"&lt;a href=\"Shavari%27s%20Note\"&gt;Shavari's Note&lt;/a&gt;\" can be looted from her corpse.\nFrom the Ragged Flagon, head through the Ratway Tunnels to get to the Ratway Warrens. It may be necessary to fight several Thalmor while navigating through the tunnels before locating the entrance.\nOnce in the Warrens, locate a locked door with a viewing slot at the top of a set of steps and activate the door to engage Esbern in conversation. The Dragonborn will then be able to tell Esbern about Delphine and warn him of the Thalmor searching for him. After being convinced, there is an unusually long delay as he gathers his thoughts and unlocks what seems like an absurd number of door locks and bars.\nOnce inside, the conversation will continue as he gathers his belongings. He will be able to provide some additional background information about the Blades, and the Dragonborn will bring him up to date on current events. Once the conversation with Esbern has ended, this quest will be completed and \"&lt;a href=\"Alduin%27s%20Wall%20%28Quest%29\"&gt;Alduin's Wall&lt;/a&gt;\" will begin."}

I've always yearned for an opportunity to sample authentic &lt;a href=\"Argonians%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Argonian&lt;/a&gt; cuisine. Now, at long last, the moment has arrived! I've decided to begin with a regional delicacy\u2014slugs.\nLike all good Argonian fare, slugs are frequently served raw and often with a sprig of salt-meadow leaf. I was only able to sample three types during this visit. My chef's accent was very thick, but I believe the limited fare had something to do with the season. I've learned that swamp seasons change as quickly as the wind. So there may well be a whole new array to choose from in a few days. I can only hope that they are as flavorful as what I sampled today!\nBearded BlueThis indigo beauty is quite common in the bogs surrounding &lt;a href=\"Tsofeer%20Cavern\"&gt;Tsofeer Cavern&lt;/a&gt;. It's roughly the size of a &lt;a href=\"Nords%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Nord&lt;/a&gt;'s thumb and features a shaggy clump of tentacles beneath its long eye stalks. The slug features a subtle aroma, but it also has refreshingly citrusy undertones. The extra tentacles give the Bearded Blue a unique texture that can be a little distracting (particularly when consumed alive), but it tastes simply divine. The flavor is earth-driven with subdued loamy notes hidden below a firm citrusy bite. I was most struck by the crisp finish. Quite a treat!\nBlack-Banded SliderThe Black-Banded Slider is something of a local staple. It is often smoked and eaten on a bed of weevil larvae and orange-grass, but I insisted on tasting it raw. The slug excretes an acrid black oil when disturbed, but it was easily wiped away to reveal a long body with a series of broad black stripes across a pale, creamy mantle. Even washed, the Black-Banded Slider presents a chewy, tannic flavor that must be endured to reach the clean and nuanced aftertaste that the Argonians seem to relish. It's a mellow, almost floral flourish to an otherwise imposing meal.\nKing YellowI was delighted to hear that the King Yellow was in season. This is a truly massive creature; roughly as long as my forearm and covered in a vast forest of fleshy, undulating bristles! It's always difficult to tell with Argonians, but I think that my chef was very surprised to hear my request for one served raw. He placed the beast in front of me, wrapped in a wasso nut leaf with an indigo lily garnish. I was immediately struck by the rich bouquet of mossy, herbaceous scents. You can practically smell all of Black Marsh in the creature's mucous excretions. Each bite brought on a new wave of astonishing flavor. The brooding, nutty tang of the tail meat eventually gave way to the thick, oily bitters of the mantle. At last, I reached the head. I'm hard pressed to think of a more alarming eruption of flavor! A cloying, buttery taste that swings wildly toward a dry, mustardy finish. Spectacular!\nI left the table with a heavy heart, knowing that I will likely not be able to taste the King Yellow again for another season. But I'm buoyed by the knowledge that tomorrow will bring a grand, new culinary adventure. This time, beetle larvae! I can hardly wait!"}

Of course, I use the term \"farm\" loosely. In actual fact, the farm is just a series of small reed enclosures that each house hundreds of caterpillars. I was shocked by the sheer variety. I saw long caterpillars, fat caterpillars, orange and purple-striped caterpillars\u2014I've never seen such diversity!\nI asked a few questions, but Mach-Makka's limited mastery of Cyrodilic continues to interfere with our repartee. I've attempted to learn some &lt;a href=\"Jel\"&gt;Jel&lt;/a&gt; to bridge the language gap, but it is slow going to be sure. Still, he tries to help me along. I'm told that he thinks I'm hilarious. Of course, it's impossible to tell such things with &lt;a href=\"Argonians%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Argonians&lt;/a&gt;. I asked if he ate the caterpillars and he seemed amused by this. He simply shook his head and took me into a larger enclosure. When he ignited the lamp, the room burst into a spray of colors. Huge butterflies and moths erupted from the walls, dancing around the lamp in a cyclone of beating wings. He gestured at some of the larger specimens and spoke at length in pig-Cyrodilic. He encouraged me to grab a few before leaving the enclosure.\nEating moths and butterflies is a challenging but rewarding culinary experience. Most outsiders who are brave enough to sample the local cuisine remove the wings before eating. Mach-Makka offered to remove them for me, but I refused. He said something to his assistant in Jel and for a moment both seemed mildly amused. That probably means Mach-Makka said something fantastically funny. A few moments later, he served me five Green Slipper-Tails in a traditional \"ajum\" (a woven tray with a netted lid). I set upon them with relish!\nA truly satisfying butterfly dish hinges on the delicate art of \"Iuheeez,\" or \"wing folding.\" Argonian master chefs use their claws to bend and fold the wings into tiny but ornate edible sculptures. Unfortunately, local custom dictates that outsiders fold their own wings. I made my best effort to replicate the simplest \"Xeech\" fold, but I wound up making quite a mess. Even so, the meal was delicious. Green Slipper-Tails are perhaps the sweetest of the Slipper-Tails species\u2014tasting of honey-grass with a sweet but chalky finish. Hopefully, I'm provided with many more opportunities to master butterfly cuisine!"}

He's been preparing a meal that I didn't even know existed. How marvelous! His assistant told me that the locals call it a \"nagahssee\" which translates to something like \"snake roll,\" I think. \"Snake stocking\" would probably be more appropriate. More on that in a moment.\nThe process begins by catching a wasso hedge snake. Apparently Mach-Makka only trusts one local snake dealer - a sharp-faced hunter named Paxit. In talking to Paxit, I found out that picking a reputable snake dealer is of paramount importance when preparing nagahssee. You see, the wassoo hedge snake looks almost exactly like the red hooped tree-viper. Eating the former will give you a full belly. Eating the latter will kill you before you leave the table. I was delighted to hear this story. Dangerous food is something of an obsession for me!\nOnce the chef has acquired a snake, he or she goes to work on disemboweling it. The snake's interior is used in a number of other dishes, but nagahssee only requires the skin. The empty skin is packed with a nix of wild marsh rice, dried parsnips, sliced bark-ear mushrooms, and a live mouse! Paxit explained to me that nagahssee is a unique dish that always changes. Those who choose to eat the dish when it is first prepared are treated to the fresh vegetable medley and the lean, wriggling meat of the mouse. But those who choose to let the dish rest for a few hours (or even days) are richly rewarded for the patience. The longer the dish rests, the fatter the mouse becomes. It can spend a great deal of time feasting on the rice and parsnips before finally expiring. An average nagahssee takes about five days to \"ripen\".\nHearing all this, I couldn't wait to get my hands on one. I selected a roll that had been resting for the better part of two days. I still heard a faint squeaking from beneath the skin. I think I'll wait a bit longer before I take my first bite!"}

While I've learned a tremendous amount about Argonian cuisine, there is still one dish I have not tried: the Aojee-Sakka. Anytime I request it, Mach-Makka becomes agitated and serves me something else. I suppose his hesitancy is understandable. The Aojee-Sakka is among the most dangerous meals in all of Tamriel.\nThe meal actually consists of two dishes served simultaneously. The primary dish is a seared and delicately sliced Aojee Toad on a bed of caramelized figs and cinnamon-grass. The second dish is a bowl of cold hosh (a dark and viscous soup). Neither of these dishes can be consumed alone, as each is a deadly poison. Rather, they must be eaten slowly and simultaneously. One poison serves as the antidote to the other. Eating too much of the toad leads to violent tremors and mouth frothing, followed by death. Eating too much hosh leads to searing intestinal pain and vomiting, followed by death. Not surprisingly, most people avoid this dish, chef and customer alike. But my palate cannot be denied!\nI believe that Mach-Makka is at least considering my request. I've brought a small fortune in gold and signed a half-dozen bizarre snake-skin documents (which I can only assume are waivers of some kind). I can practically taste the toad already. My culinary adventure is almost complete!\nI return this book to you, Rallaume-friend. I try to cook Rallaume other foods, but he demands Aojee-Sakka. I cook it for him, but he eats it wrong. Too much toad. I am very sorry he dies.\nHave a good life! We hope you come eat with us, too! But not the Aojee-Sakka.\n\u2014Mach-Makka"}

An end to &lt;a href=\"Lycanthropy%20%28Online%29\"&gt;lycanthropy&lt;/a&gt;, once and for all. For over a decade I have devoted myself to this very research, and now that I've finally found my answer, I am told no?\nI realize &lt;a href=\"Commander%20Edette\"&gt;Commander Edette&lt;/a&gt;'s concerns are not unfounded, and I cannot deny the risks of such a venture. To even find a werewolf transformed by &lt;a href=\"Hircine%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Hircine&lt;/a&gt; would be a tremendous task. And then to capture the creature? There's absolutely no guarantee that the &lt;a href=\"Order%20of%20the%20Silver%20Dawn\"&gt;Silver Dawn&lt;/a&gt; would be capable of such a feat.\nEven still, should we not even try? When I think of all of the good that can be accomplished, should my research bear fruit! Is this not our very purpose as an order? To completely eradicate the lycanthrope threat?\nI must convince Commander Edette to agree to this research. I must.\nIt seems &lt;a href=\"the%20Divines\"&gt;the Divines&lt;/a&gt; have smiled upon me. Though it's only been a few short months since I've made inquiries, I've just received word of a werewolf named &lt;a href=\"Vykosa\"&gt;Vykosa&lt;/a&gt; hiding somewhere within &lt;a href=\"Malabal%20Tor\"&gt;Malabal Tor&lt;/a&gt;.\nRumor has it that she is a first turned, changed into a beast by Hircine himself. My records seem to only collaborate on this, as I've found records which mention her name that date centuries back. This may be just the opportunity I've been looking for.\nUnfortunately, Commander Edette still stands in my way. Her word is law within this keep, and every mention of my research only seems to fill her with a stronger resolve to deny me.\nBut I can't give up hope, not now. Not when so much is at stake. I simply must persuade the commander, no matter the cost. And I believe I have just the thing to bring her to my side.\nCommander Edette has finally agreed to the capture of Vykosa. Unsurprising, given that her own husband has now been cursed with lycanthropy; a transformation courtesy of one of the many blood samples at my disposal.\nPut forth the idea of curing masses, and the commander balked at the dangers. But when it's her loved one in need of such a cure? She crumbled right before my eyes. Pathetic.\nNow I must simply set a trap for Vykosa. No easy task, of course, but one that I'm confident a man of my intellect can pull off. Victory is almost at hand. One way or another, I will create this cure. By the &lt;a href=\"Nine%20Divines\"&gt;Eight&lt;/a&gt;, I must. After all, I do this not for my own satisfaction. I do this for the good of &lt;a href=\"human\"&gt;human&lt;/a&gt;kind."}

Asking members of the &lt;a href=\"Mages%20Guild%20%28Morrowind%29\"&gt;Mages guild&lt;/a&gt; and sorcerers will help start the quest. Many people will suggest reading the banned book, &lt;a href=\"Vampires%20of%20Vvardenfell%2C%20Book%20II\"&gt;Vampires of Vvardenfell, Book II&lt;/a&gt;, but the quest starts when the Nerevarine reads &lt;a href=\"Galur%20Rithari%27s%20Papers%20%28Book%29\"&gt;Galur Rithari's Papers&lt;/a&gt;. There are only two copies of this book in all of Vvardenfell: one is in &lt;a href=\"Galom%20Daeus%20%28Morrowind%29\"&gt;Galom Daeus&lt;/a&gt; and the other is in the &lt;a href=\"Hall%20of%20Justice%20Secret%20Library\"&gt;Hall of Justice Secret Library&lt;/a&gt;, requiring either fighting one's way through the former or stealing it from the latter. This step is optional and can be skipped if the Nerevarine has correctly deciphered the clues in \"Vampires of Vardenfell\" as the quest will then start when talking with &lt;a href=\"Derar%20Hlervu\"&gt;Derar Hlervu&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe next step is to go to &lt;a href=\"Bal%20Ur%20%28Morrowind%29\"&gt;Bal Ur&lt;/a&gt; and head to the underground section. After getting past various opponents, Derar Hlervu will be standing in front of the statue of &lt;a href=\"Molag%20Bal\"&gt;Molag Bal&lt;/a&gt;. The Nerevarine should speak to him and he instructs them to speak to the statue. Molag Bal will say that he does not have the cure, but will find it if the Nerevarine kills his daughter, &lt;a href=\"Molag%20Grunda%20%28Morrowind%29\"&gt;Molag Grunda&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Frost%20Atronach%20%28Morrowind%29\"&gt;Frost Atronach&lt;/a&gt; named &lt;a href=\"Nomeg%20Gwai\"&gt;Nomeg Gwai&lt;/a&gt; that she has been consorting with in &lt;a href=\"Dubdilla\"&gt;Dubdilla&lt;/a&gt;.\nDubdilla is south of &lt;a href=\"Vos%20%28Morrowind%29\"&gt;Vos&lt;/a&gt;.

A guard or &lt;a href=\"Lod\"&gt;Lod&lt;/a&gt; himself (whether the quest \"&lt;a href=\"Some%20Light%20Theft\"&gt;Some Light Theft&lt;/a&gt;\" is completed or not) will say he has been looking for a dog and spotted one near the entrance of Falkreath. Lod can be persuaded for half payment (25 can be received) or the task can be taken.\nBarbas can be found west of Falkreath along the road beyond the fork where he will approach the Dragonborn. They can return to Lod once Barbas is found, hand in the quest and then return to Barbas where he is waiting. Barbas will also warn the Dragonborn not to make any deals with Clavicus Vile.\nBarbas will lead the Dragonborn to Haemar's Shame where the Dragonborn and Barbas will fight vampires and their thralls together, depending on current level. Expect the vampires to use Conjuration spells to reanimate any dead bodies nearby, whether the bodies were already dead, or killed by the Dragonborn and Barbas. Haemar's Shame is located directly in between &lt;a href=\"Ivarstead%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Ivarstead&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Fort%20Neugrad\"&gt;Fort Neugrad&lt;/a&gt;. There are a few leveled enchanted items, an &lt;a href=\"Arcane%20Enchanter%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;arcane enchanter&lt;/a&gt; and an &lt;a href=\"Alchemy%20Lab%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;alchemy lab&lt;/a&gt;. The Shrine of Clavicus Vile is located deeper in the cave, guarded by four to five vampires. Activate the statue of Clavicus Vile and he will ask what he can do for the Dragonborn.\nThe Dragonborn will be tasked with retrieving the Rueful Axe from &lt;a href=\"Rimerock%20Burrow\"&gt;Rimerock Burrow&lt;/a&gt;. Barbas can be kept as a follower or told to stay. Behind the statue on the upper walkway is a chest with some leveled items and a chain that opens a barricaded tunnel leading back to Skyrim.\nBarbas can provide history on the Rueful Axe if asked, saying: \"One of Clavicus's little jests. A wizard named Sebastian Lort had a daughter who worshiped Hircine. When the daughter became a werewolf it drove Sebastian over the edge. He couldn't stand to see his little girl take on such a bestial form. The wizard wished for the ability to end his daughter's curse. Clavicus gave him an axe.\"\nRimerock Burrow is a small cave in the far northwest of Skyrim. At the end of a short tunnel, there will be a &lt;a href=\"Flame%20Atronach%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;flame atronach&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Sebastian%20Lort\"&gt;Sebastian Lort&lt;/a&gt;, a &lt;a href=\"Bretons%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Breton&lt;/a&gt; mage. He may summon a &lt;a href=\"Frost%20Atronach%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;frost atronach&lt;/a&gt;. The axe itself will be lying on a long table opposite an Arcane Enchanter. Behind them is a room with a &lt;a href=\"Containers%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;chest&lt;/a&gt; containing leveled loot.\nThe Dragonborn must now return to Clavicus Vile. They are given a choice to either kill Barbas and keep the Rueful Axe or to spare Barbas and receive Vile's boon, the Masque of Clavicus Vile. Once the choice is made, the quest is finished, and the reward is received.\nClavicus Vile.\nLord Vile, I have a request of you. \"By all means, let's hear it. It's the least I could do, since you already helped me grant one final wish for my last worshippers... They were suffering so from vampirism, and begged me for a cure. Then you came in and ended their misery! I couldn't have planned it better myself. So, what's your heart's desire? What kind of deal can we strike?\"\nIf approached again:\nWhat did you want, again? \"In Rimerock Burrow, there's an artifact called the Rueful Axe. Bring it to me, and I'll take Barbas back. Simple as that.\"\nAfter obtaining the axe:\n\"Ah, you've got the axe! And my dog. Splendid.\"\nIf told to kill Barbas, and approached again:\nI've been thinking it over... \"And?\"\nAfter killing Barbas:\nHe's dead. Are we done here? \"Absolutely! Now I can reabsorb his body, and return to full power. All without having to listen to his whining. Oh, sure, he'll be back in a century or two, but think of the fun I can have 'til then. Enjoy that axe! And don't worry about poor old Barbas. After all, he really should have picked a better friend...\"\nDawnguard.\nIn , one may come across Barbas and the statue at Haemar's Shame. He may still be there, depending if one has done this quest. During the Dawnguard mission, if Barbas is still alive he will try to kill the vampires they are fighting. He never dies and therefore, provides good help."}

While physically contained inside a person-sized Celestiodrome deep beneath &lt;a href=\"Bamz-Amschend\"&gt;Bamz-Amschend&lt;/a&gt;, the city itself exists \"outside space and time.\"\nHistory.\nThe Clockwork City was made by the god Sotha Sil and consisted of brass tunnels and large domes with &lt;a href=\"Dwemer\"&gt;Dwemer&lt;/a&gt;-like gears and architecture. It is said that Sotha Sil hoped to \"forge the future\" and \"reshape the world\" from the city. After losing &lt;a href=\"Sunder\"&gt;Sunder&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Keening\"&gt;Keening&lt;/a&gt; at &lt;a href=\"Red%20Mountain\"&gt;Red Mountain&lt;/a&gt;, Sotha Sil retreated to the city and slowly became detached from the real world.\nIn &lt;a href=\"3E%20427\"&gt;3E 427&lt;/a&gt; the goddess &lt;a href=\"Almalexia\"&gt;Almalexia&lt;/a&gt;, after being driven insane by the loss of the &lt;a href=\"Heart%20of%20Lorkhan\"&gt;Heart of Lorkhan&lt;/a&gt;, traveled to the Clockwork City by using &lt;a href=\"Barilzar%27s%20Mazed%20Band%20%28Item%29\"&gt;Barilzar's Mazed Band&lt;/a&gt; after tricking the &lt;a href=\"Nerevarine\"&gt;Nerevarine&lt;/a&gt; into obtaining it from the &lt;a href=\"Lich%20%28Tribunal%29\"&gt;Lich&lt;/a&gt; named &lt;a href=\"Barilzar%20%28Tribunal%29\"&gt;Barilzar&lt;/a&gt;, and killed Sotha Sil. She then transported the creatures that lived in the city known as &lt;a href=\"Fabricant%20%28Tribunal%29\"&gt;Fabricants&lt;/a&gt; to attack &lt;a href=\"Mournhold%20%28Tribunal%29\"&gt;Mournhold&lt;/a&gt; in a plot to become the one true god of the &lt;a href=\"Dunmer\"&gt;Dunmer&lt;/a&gt; faith. She told the Nerevarine that Sotha Sil had instigated the attack of Mournhold and sent the Nerevarine to the city to find and kill the supposed mad god. Almalexia hoped that the mechanical inhabitants of the city would kill the Nerevarine but the hero persevered and found the lifeless corpse of Sotha Sil. Almalexia then fought the Nerevarine in a duel to the death in which she was killed and the city was left uninhabited.\nLocation.\nThe Clockwork City is located very deep below &lt;a href=\"Mournhold\"&gt;Mournhold&lt;/a&gt;, unknown to most of Tamriel. The entire city is located in a person-sized metallic sphere found in &lt;a href=\"Seht%27s%20Vault\"&gt;Seht's Vault&lt;/a&gt;, with all the buildings being extremely small, requiring anyone to shrink themselves down in order to enter the city.\nIt is sometimes thought to be located in &lt;a href=\"Morrowind\"&gt;Morrowind&lt;/a&gt;'s southern swamps. Another source says that it is located underneath &lt;a href=\"Ebonheart\"&gt;Ebonheart&lt;/a&gt;.\nInhabitants.\nThe Clockwork City is home to the god Sotha Sil and his creations. The primary creatures living in the city are &lt;a href=\"Fabricant\"&gt;Fabricant&lt;/a&gt;s, who are a mix of mechanical and organic components. Purely mechanical robots called &lt;a href=\"Factotum\"&gt;Factotum&lt;/a&gt;s also serve as guardians, like &lt;a href=\"Calefactor\"&gt;Calefactor&lt;/a&gt;s and &lt;a href=\"Imperfect\"&gt;Imperfect&lt;/a&gt;s. Some other reformatted &lt;a href=\"Animunculi\"&gt;Animunculi&lt;/a&gt; like the &lt;a href=\"Refabricated%20Arquebus\"&gt;Refabricated Arquebus&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"Rupture%20Centurion\"&gt;Rupture Centurion&lt;/a&gt; also inhabit the city.\nAreas.\nThe primary part of the city is the &lt;a href=\"Brass%20Fortress\"&gt;Brass Fortress&lt;/a&gt;, a large hub for inhabitants of the area. The &lt;a href=\"Clockwork%20Basilica\"&gt;Clockwork Basilica&lt;/a&gt;, a large tower and the tallest structure of the city, stands in the center of the Fortress. Parts of the city outside the Fortress are called \"The Radius,\" which are roamed by untamed mechanical wildlife.\nPart of the Clockwork City consists of domes and metal tunnels such as the Outer and Inner Flooded Halls; the Halls of Delirium, Theuda, Sallaemu and Mileitho; the Central Gearworks; the Chamber of Sohleh; and the Domes of Kasia, Serlyn, Udok, the Imperfect and Sotha Sil. Sotha Sil lived in the dome of Sotha Sil which was guarded by two Imperfects."}

Parts of the city are also accessed in .\nBackground.\nDue to its metaphysical properties, the Clockwork City is accessible from various locations at various times. During the construction of &lt;a href=\"Tel%20Fyr%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Tel Fyr&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"2E%20582\"&gt;2E 582&lt;/a&gt;, a portal to the city opened in the &lt;a href=\"Abanabi%20Cave\"&gt;Abanabi Cave&lt;/a&gt; system beneath the tower. In the same year, the Clockwork Globe that allowed access to the city was located in the &lt;a href=\"Dwemer%20ruins\"&gt;Dwemer ruins&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"Bamz-Amschend\"&gt;Bamz-Amschend&lt;/a&gt; underneath Mournhold.\nIn 2E 582, the city was infiltrated by the &lt;a href=\"Court%20of%20Bedlam\"&gt;Court of Bedlam&lt;/a&gt; after &lt;a href=\"Barbas%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Barbas&lt;/a&gt;, the hound of &lt;a href=\"Clavicus%20Vile\"&gt;Clavicus Vile&lt;/a&gt;, attempted to steal the power of &lt;a href=\"Vivec%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Vivec&lt;/a&gt; and was able to learn the city's location. &lt;a href=\"Nocturnal%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Nocturnal&lt;/a&gt;'s forces soon infiltrated the city in an attempt to take control as part of the Court's plan to control Mundus.\nLocations.\nThe following are locations accessible in the Clockwork City and, with the exception of &lt;a href=\"Unmarked%20Locations%20%28Online%29\"&gt;unmarked locations&lt;/a&gt;, are discoverable on the map. Points of Interest serve as locations with unique side quests, while &lt;a href=\"Cities%20%28Online%29\"&gt;cities&lt;/a&gt; serve as the centralised areas with multiple sublocations and act as a hub for services and &lt;a href=\"Merchants%20%28Online%29\"&gt;merchants&lt;/a&gt;. Explanations of the types of locations are provided in the &lt;a href=\"Locations%20%28Online%29%23Types\"&gt;main locations page&lt;/a&gt;.\nQuests.\nThe Clockwork City features a series of zone story quests and unrelated side quests. The zone story quests tie into the &lt;a href=\"Daedric%20War\"&gt;Daedric War&lt;/a&gt;'s overarching storyline and carries on from &lt;a href=\"Vvardenfell%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Vvardenfell&lt;/a&gt; before continuing to &lt;a href=\"Summerset%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Summerset&lt;/a&gt;, but it is not necessary to complete the story quests for zones prior to those in the Clockwork City. Side quests are non-sequential and can be completed in any order, except where one carries on from another, and &lt;a href=\"repeatable%20quests\"&gt;repeatable quests&lt;/a&gt; can be completed multiple times: weekly for arenas and trials and daily for all others.\nItem Sets.\nItem sets are related armor and weapons that, when worn together, provide unique benefits. Overland sets can be acquired from world bosses, world events, delves, public dungeons and containers and as quest rewards; dungeon sets can be acquired from within group dungeons; monster sets can be acquired from the final boss of veteran group dungeons and Undaunted Enclaves; and crafted sets can be created at specific locations across the zone.\nSkyshards.\nSix Skyshards can be found in the Clockwork City totaling in two &lt;a href=\"skill%20points\"&gt;skill points&lt;/a&gt;. The zone guide provides clues as to the location of each Skyshard, but many can be found simply by exploring and watching for the distinctive pillar of light they emit. Skyshards will appear on the map and compass when the Vestige is close to one and will remain discovered on the map even if it was not collected.\nAchievements.\nAchievements can be earned by completing specific tasks include quests and finding locations. Achievements are separated into categories and their progress is viewable from the journal. Earning achievement provides the Vestige some amount of points. Points earned only apply to the character that earned the achievement. Some achievements unlock unique rewards such as trophies or dyes.\nShalidor's Library.\nEight books that are a part of Shalidor's Library can be found in the Clockwork City and added to the collection. Books that have already been found in other zones will already be marked as completed in the zone tracker.\nFish.\nFish can be caught from fishing hotspots, ideally with the correct &lt;a href=\"bait\"&gt;bait&lt;/a&gt;. Common fish will be caught most often while rare fish and alternative bait are rare catches. Each zone has unique rare fish than can be caught from hotspots. &lt;a href=\"Slaughterfish%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Slaughterfish&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"trodh\"&gt;trodh&lt;/a&gt; can be caught from foul hotspots, &lt;a href=\"dhufish\"&gt;dhufish&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"longfin\"&gt;longfin&lt;/a&gt; can be caught from saltwater hotspots, &lt;a href=\"silverside%20perch\"&gt;silverside perch&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"spadetail\"&gt;spadetail&lt;/a&gt; can be caught from lake hotspots, and &lt;a href=\"Salmon%20%28Online%29\"&gt;salmon&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"River%20Betty%20%28Online%29\"&gt;river betty&lt;/a&gt; can be caught from river hotspots. &lt;a href=\"Chub\"&gt;Chub&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"minnow\"&gt;minnow&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"shad\"&gt;shad&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"fish%20roe\"&gt;fish roe&lt;/a&gt; can be caught and used as bait from foul, saltwater, lake and river hotspots, respectively.\nGallery.\nEarly previews.\nThe following are previews of the Clockwork City from 2015, during the time it was still in early development:"}

Sounding a Hallowed Clarion in all eight ruins, all at the same time, may be enough to bring the Octal Cage to life.\nI depart in the morning. If my task proves fruitless, so be it.

Some clothing (such as the Rugged Pants and Black Hood) have a weight of 0 &lt;a href=\"Encumbrance%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;Encumbrance&lt;/a&gt;, making them ideal items for &lt;a href=\"Enchanting%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;enchanting&lt;/a&gt;, due to them not increasing the Hero's encumbrance.\nObtaining clothes.\nClothing is relatively easy to find and obtain. There are multiple methods to obtain clothes including the use of &lt;a href=\"Console%20Commands%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;console commands&lt;/a&gt;, finding them, looting them from another character, and purchasing them. Clothes are found in dressers, drawers, cupboards, and other containers throughout Cyrodiil. The clothes found in these containers will often correspond with its owner's social class.\nVarious clothing can be purchased from clothes and general goods type merchants. Some notable merchants are:\nShirts.\nShirts are clothes that cover the Hero's torso, allowing them to wear anything else as long as it does not conflict with the torso. Shirts are worn by many of the citizens throughout Cyrodiil and depend on their social class.\nPants.\nPants are clothing that covers the legs of the Hero, preventing them from wearing any greaves or clothing that covers the legs. Pants are worn depending on a NPC's social class. Some pants change into skirts when worn by a female character or Hero.\nShoes.\nShoes are clothing that cover the &lt;a href=\"Hero%20of%20Kvatch\"&gt;Hero's&lt;/a&gt; feet, preventing other footwear from being equipped. Shoes can be found commonly in houses and are worn depending on a NPC's social class.\nRobes and hoods.\nRobes are full body clothing that commonly cover a character's torso, legs, and sometimes feet. Most robes also have corresponding hoods that cover the head of the character. Robes and hoods can be easily found as they are often worn by mages, priests, necromancers, and other common characters. Certain robes can also be purchased at &lt;a href=\"Rindir%27s%20Staffs\"&gt;Rindir's Staffs&lt;/a&gt;.\nOutfits.\nSimilar to robes, some clothes take up both the Hero's torso and legs, preventing them from wearing any pants, greaves, shirt, or cuirass. Outfits worn by npcs in Cyrodiil correspond to their social standing and economic class.\nMost of these outfits are relatively easy to obtain. Other than locations listed in the below table, outfits can be found in containers such as drawers or dressers and a few outfits can be purchased at &lt;a href=\"Divine%20Elegance\"&gt;Divine Elegance&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"Nord%20Winds\"&gt;Nord Winds&lt;/a&gt;."}

Cloudrest is the Aerie of the Altmer, overseeing the entire island from the mountains of Eton Nir. It is home to the &lt;a href=\"Welkynar%20Gryphon%20Riders\"&gt;Welkynar Gryphon Riders&lt;/a&gt;, a group of Altmeri warriors that utilize &lt;a href=\"Gryphon\"&gt;Gryphon&lt;/a&gt;s in combat. They are revered throughout the land.\nDescription.\nGeography.\nCloudrest is situated on the highest slope of &lt;a href=\"Eton%20Nir\"&gt;Eton Nir&lt;/a&gt;, along the southern reaches and towards the mysterious forest of &lt;a href=\"Ebon%20Stadmont\"&gt;Ebon Stadmont&lt;/a&gt;. Cloudrest is accessible from a path that derails from the main road that runs along the western bay. Cloudrest is divided into two areas, which descends the mountain. Upper Craglorn towers above the city, and it is the home of the &lt;a href=\"Welkynar%20Gryphon%20Riders\"&gt;Welkynar Gryphon Riders&lt;/a&gt;, who reside in the Cloudrest Aerie. The Aerie is the headquarters of the Riders; each is given a platform to land, which connects to the main platform. Around the platform are various siege weapons, such as &lt;a href=\"Trebuchets\"&gt;Trebuchets&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Ballista\"&gt;Ballista&lt;/a&gt;e. The center of the platform is where the Riders congregate and the &lt;a href=\"Gryphon\"&gt;Gryphon&lt;/a&gt;s sleep in. The Aerie is connected to the upper city via a long bridge that towers over the lower district. From there begins the Cloudrest Upper streets, that eventually revolve around to the lower area. Continuing downward will lead to the town, where the populous gather to socialize and trade. Running along the lower area is a river, which descends into the western bay of the island. The main gate of the city connects to the lower area, with many towers scattered about the city. Underneath the city is a complex known as the &lt;a href=\"Baron%27s%20Maze\"&gt;Baron's Maze&lt;/a&gt;, not much is known about them.\nHistory.\n&lt;a href=\"Merethic%20Era\"&gt;Merethic Era&lt;/a&gt;.\nBefore the High Elves inhabited the Isle of Summerset, it was considered a part of &lt;a href=\"Thras\"&gt;Thras&lt;/a&gt;, an archipelago located north of the region. Thras is the home of the &lt;a href=\"Sload\"&gt;Sload&lt;/a&gt;, a race of slug-folk with an affinity in &lt;a href=\"Necromancy\"&gt;Necromancy&lt;/a&gt;. The Sload built the original settlement that would become Cloudrest until they were cast out by the &lt;a href=\"Aldmeri\"&gt;Aldmeri&lt;/a&gt;. The city-state of Cloudrest was built atop of the ruins, which remain underneath the city for years. As time went on, the modern-day province of the Summerset Isles would be established, and the Elves would spread across the continent, resulting in the modern Elven races. Cloudrest would flourish as a Kingdom in the Summerset Isles.\n&lt;a href=\"Second%20Era\"&gt;Second Era&lt;/a&gt;.\nDuring the &lt;a href=\"Interregnum\"&gt;Interregnum&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"2E%20583\"&gt;2E 583&lt;/a&gt;, the Welkynar Gryphon Riders were led by &lt;a href=\"Relequen\"&gt;Relequen&lt;/a&gt;, operating out of the Aerie that overlooks the city. At one point, the Welkynars were dispatched to capture a dangerous &lt;a href=\"Sea%20Sload\"&gt;Sea Sload&lt;/a&gt; known as &lt;a href=\"Z%27Maja\"&gt;Z'Maja&lt;/a&gt;. Z'Maja utilizes strange magic, reminiscent of &lt;a href=\"Nocturnal\"&gt;Nocturnal&lt;/a&gt;. The haze that she used was too strong for the Welkynars, but fortunately, they evaded it. But when the brought Z'Maja to Cloudrest, many questioned this, and it soon became prevalent that Z'Maja was plotting against the city. This turned out to be true when the &lt;a href=\"Divine%20Prosecution\"&gt;Divine Prosecution&lt;/a&gt; was forced to evacuate the city, and the Welkynar (except &lt;a href=\"Olorime\"&gt;Olorime&lt;/a&gt;) were captured by the Sload. With little hope, Olorime gathered &lt;a href=\"Vestige\"&gt;warriors&lt;/a&gt; from across the land to defeat Z'Maja and her shadows. The Warriors were able to defeat shades of the Welkynar and their Gryphons, but it ultimately killed them. With them gone, Z'Maja was dealt with, saving Cloudrest. With the city saved, Olorime set out to rebuild the Welkynars and await the call for action.\n&lt;a href=\"Third%20Era\"&gt;Third Era&lt;/a&gt;.\nDuring the &lt;a href=\"Imperial%20Simulacrum\"&gt;Imperial Simulacrum&lt;/a&gt; from &lt;a href=\"3E%20389\"&gt;3E 389&lt;/a&gt; to &lt;a href=\"3E%20399\"&gt;3E 399&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Emperor\"&gt;Emperor&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Uriel%20Septim%20VII\"&gt;Uriel Septim VII&lt;/a&gt; was imprisoned along with &lt;a href=\"Talin%20Warhaft\"&gt;Talin Warhaft&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;a href=\"Deadlands\"&gt;Deadlands&lt;/a&gt; by &lt;a href=\"Jagar%20Tharn\"&gt;Jagar Tharn&lt;/a&gt;. Tharn planned for months to capture the throne, and he was able to achieve so in ten years. Tharn had a powerful weapon called the &lt;a href=\"Staff%20of%20Chaos\"&gt;Staff of Chaos&lt;/a&gt;, and he split it into nine pieces and scattered them across Tamriel, the staff was the only thing keeping Uriel Septim and Warhaft in &lt;a href=\"Oblivion\"&gt;Oblivion&lt;/a&gt;. A warrior escaped his clutches and traveled all corners of Tamriel to retrieve the missing pieces. The hero was known as the &lt;a href=\"Eternal%20Champion\"&gt;Eternal Champion&lt;/a&gt;, and he assembled the staff and defeated Jagar Tharn at the &lt;a href=\"Imperial%20Palace\"&gt;Imperial Palace&lt;/a&gt;. The Eternal Champion had at one point visited the city in their quest to recover the pieces. The city of Cloudrest was under the rule of &lt;a href=\"King%20Kelkemmenar\"&gt;King Kelkemmenar&lt;/a&gt;."}

It is meant to serve as a guideline for the &lt;a href=\"Baandari%20Pedlars\"&gt;Baandari Pedlars&lt;/a&gt;, so that they know what is honest and fair in terms of business, and how to best practice it.\nContents.\nCode of the Baandari Pedlars\nBy &lt;a href=\"Semsirr-dar\"&gt;Semsirr-dar&lt;/a&gt; of the Road\nDo not listen when Town-Biders call you thief, or charlatan, or dishonorable. Such people are ignorant and insular, and know naught of anything beyond the borders of their township. Dishonorable, sooth! One is not dishonorable if one has a code of behavior that one lives by. And this is so for the &lt;a href=\"Baandari%20Clan\"&gt;Baandari&lt;/a&gt;.\nAbide thus by our code, Baandari, or you will be cast out and no longer dwell among us. Those who break the code and become Cast-Cats may be pitied, but they shall not be readmitted among us. For how will the world trust us if we cannot trust ourselves?\nThe Baandari Code by which we live consists of both written bylaws and unwritten bylaws. The unwritten bylaws may not be written, for how if written could they be unwritten bylaws? But the written bylaws are as follows:\nThe Bylaw of Salvage: Sometimes objects are loose and uncontained, being neither in pocket, in drawer, or in hand. Such objects are abandoned and may be lawfully salvaged, for clearly no one cares enough about them to see them properly contained. It is meet and commendable for a Baandari to salvage an object thus abandoned, for a Baandari is thrifty and deplores waste.\nThe Bylaw of Prophesy: Frequently Town-Biders offer Baandari payment in return for advice and prophesy regarding events yet to come. In this transaction a client must be told that which would be most pleasing to hear, for it is a serious breach of etiquette to offend a client with words that are unkind or unwanted. To prevent such a breach, it is meet and commendable for a Baandari to spend time with sharp ears in the local inn or tavern so as to ascertain what advice might best please potential local clients.\nThe Bylaw of Guarantees: A true Baandari sells only the finest goods and wares, for the Town-Biders wish to purchase only the finest goods and wares. There is no pride like that of a person who has just spent a deal of money upon a fine, new purchase, and a Baandari wants above all things for a client to be proud of having driven a hard bargain and acquired an item of the highest quality. Therefore it is meet and commendable to provide a client with the highest guarantees of an object's provenance, rarity, and desirability.\nThus the written bylaws of the Baandari Code. These bylaws are in all cases ironclad and incontrovertible\u2014except, of course, when overruled by the unwritten bylaws. Var var var."}

Are you unsure which attributes you need to bump up when you finally advance a level? Well here are some tips from the experts who have spent many days and months playing Arena! The design of Arena is particularly felicitous to spellcasters, but if you are resourceful and plan a good campaign non-spellcasters can be just as much fun to play and are also a greater challenge to the player. Playing a non-spellcaster is an easy way to increase the difficulty of the game! Also, non-spellcasters will need to spend more time on extra quests to gain funds to buy special weapons and magical items. One of the things that many people like to do with non-spellcasters is to spend more time tracking down artifact quests. Finding an artifact is one of the most rewarding moments in the game and is well-worth spending the extra time to get that quest. You might also want to postpone jumping into the staff quest until the non-spellcaster reaches a higher level. The strategy you adopt will need to be more ingenious with non-spellcasters. No matter what character you play planning in advance for a quest is an essential part of doing well in the game.\"\nPage 1.

It resembles &lt;a href=\"Nirn\"&gt;Nirn&lt;/a&gt;, but the ground is nothing more than sludge; the sky constantly burns, and yet the air is beyond freezing. Even an alternative &lt;a href=\"Imperial%20Palace\"&gt;Imperial Palace&lt;/a&gt; is known to be there, but dripping with blood and laden with corpses.\nColdharbour can only be accessed for the first time by one of two ways. The intended method is by completing the &lt;a href=\"Main%20Quest%20%28Online%29\"&gt;main quest&lt;/a&gt; \"&lt;a href=\"The%20Weight%20of%20Three%20Crowns\"&gt;The Weight of Three Crowns&lt;/a&gt;,\" but it can also be accessed earlier by teleporting to a group member already located in Coldharbour or by teleporting to &lt;a href=\"Coldharbour%20Surreal%20Estate\"&gt;Coldharbour Surreal Estate&lt;/a&gt; if it is owned and exiting from there.\nBackground.\nAs Molag Bal's sphere of influence is domination and the &lt;a href=\"Slavery\"&gt;enslavement&lt;/a&gt; of mortals, and because he is known as the God of Schemes, any mortal entering the realm is captured, enslaved and turned into one of Molag Bal's &lt;a href=\"Soul%20Shriven\"&gt;Soul Shriven&lt;/a&gt;, soulless slaves laboring for eternity under Molag Bal's command.\nColdharbour is known for its vast slave pens and laborers; bleak, dead rocky chasms; and twisted, abandoned ruins, some ripped straight out of Nirn such as the &lt;a href=\"Argonian\"&gt;Argonian&lt;/a&gt; village of &lt;a href=\"Haj%20Uxith\"&gt;Haj Uxith&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href=\"Daedra\"&gt;Daedra&lt;/a&gt; are known to wander the realm and to be among the servants to Molag Bal. Some Daedra in Coldharbour include &lt;a href=\"Harvester\"&gt;Harvester&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"Dremora\"&gt;Dremora&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Scamp\"&gt;Scamp&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"Soul%20Shriven\"&gt;Soul Shriven&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"atronach\"&gt;atronach&lt;/a&gt;s, though there are a vast number more.\nIn &lt;a href=\"2E%20582\"&gt;2E 582&lt;/a&gt;, Molag Bal began trying to merge Nirn with Coldharbour using massive inter-planar machines known as &lt;a href=\"Dark%20Anchors\"&gt;Dark Anchors&lt;/a&gt;. With the barrier between realms weakened and the &lt;a href=\"Dragonfires\"&gt;Dragonfires&lt;/a&gt; darkened, Molag Bal was able to launch a full-scale invasion of &lt;a href=\"Tamriel\"&gt;Tamriel&lt;/a&gt;.\nLocations.\nThe following are locations accessible in Coldharbour and, with the exception of &lt;a href=\"Unmarked%20Locations%20%28Online%29\"&gt;unmarked locations&lt;/a&gt;, are discoverable on the map. Points of Interest serve as locations with unique side quests, while &lt;a href=\"Cities%20%28Online%29\"&gt;cities&lt;/a&gt; serve as the centralised areas with multiple sublocations and act as a hub for services and &lt;a href=\"Merchants%20%28Online%29\"&gt;merchants&lt;/a&gt;. Explanations of the types of locations are provided in the &lt;a href=\"Locations%20%28Online%29%23Types\"&gt;main locations page&lt;/a&gt;.\nQuests.\nColdharbour features a series of zone story quests and unrelated side quests; the zone story quests tie into the main quest. Side quests are non-sequential and can be completed in any order, except where one carries on from another, and &lt;a href=\"repeatable%20quests\"&gt;repeatable quests&lt;/a&gt; can be completed multiple times: weekly for arenas and trials and daily for all others.\nItem Sets.\nItem sets are related armor and weapons that, when worn together, provide unique benefits. Overland sets can be acquired from world bosses, world events, delves, public dungeons and containers and as quest rewards; dungeon sets can be acquired from within group dungeons; monster sets can be acquired from the final boss of veteran group dungeons and Undaunted Enclaves; and crafted sets can be created at specific locations across the zone.\nSkyshards.\nSixteen Skyshards can be found in Coldharbour totaling in five &lt;a href=\"skill%20points\"&gt;skill points&lt;/a&gt; with one left over. The zone guide provides clues as to the location of each Skyshard, but many can be found simply by exploring and watching for the distinctive pillar of light they emit. Skyshards will appear on the map and compass when the Vestige is close to one and will remain discovered on the map even if it was not collected.\nAchievements.\nAchievements can be earned by completing specific tasks include quests and finding locations. Achievements are separated into categories and their progress is viewable from the journal. Earning achievement provides the Vestige some amount of points. Points earned only apply to the character that earned the achievement. Some achievements unlock unique rewards such as trophies or dyes.\nShalidor's Library.\nTen books that are a part of Shalidor's Library can be found in Coldharbour and added to the collection. Books that have already been found in other zones will already be marked as completed in the zone tracker.\nFish.\nFish can be caught from fishing hotspots, ideally with the correct &lt;a href=\"bait\"&gt;bait&lt;/a&gt;. Common fish will be caught most often while rare fish and alternative bait are rare catches. Each zone has unique rare fish than can be caught from hotspots. &lt;a href=\"Slaughterfish%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Slaughterfish&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"trodh\"&gt;trodh&lt;/a&gt; can be caught from foul hotspots, &lt;a href=\"dhufish\"&gt;dhufish&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"longfin\"&gt;longfin&lt;/a&gt; can be caught from saltwater hotspots, &lt;a href=\"silverside%20perch\"&gt;silverside perch&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"spadetail\"&gt;spadetail&lt;/a&gt; can be caught from lake hotspots, and &lt;a href=\"Salmon%20%28Online%29\"&gt;salmon&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"River%20Betty%20%28Online%29\"&gt;river betty&lt;/a&gt; can be caught from river hotspots. &lt;a href=\"Chub\"&gt;Chub&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"minnow\"&gt;minnow&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"shad\"&gt;shad&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"fish%20roe\"&gt;fish roe&lt;/a&gt; can be caught and used as bait from foul, saltwater, lake and river hotspots, respectively."}

Most of the members of the College gather around her in the Hall to listen to her lecture. After she finishes, everyone goes back to their usual schedule.\n\"\"I would just like to remind everyone, once again, that Restoration is indeed a valid school of magic. It is absolutely worthy of research, despite many of the notes I've had left in my bed. And my desk. And on occasion, my meals. Anyone suggesting that Restoration is better left to the priests of the Temples, I think, is forgetting a few things.\"\n\"\"Firstly, the ability to repel the undead cannot be ignored. Skyrim is well known to be full of these... Draugr, ancient Nord warriors who cannot find peace. I submit that everyone in this College has, at one time or another, relied on one of the Restoration spells that can keep them at bay.\"\n\"Secondly, how can anyone forget wards? They have become essential to any mage working in dangerous situations. They are counted upon every bit as much as Candlelight, or Invisibility. But more importantly, wards have saved lives. This is a simple fact. Every mage in this College regularly uses wards for practice, so as to avoid physical harm. I truly hope that these points actually sink in, and that more care and thought is given to this subject in the future. Thank you.\"\nWares.\nSelling various &lt;a href=\"Spell%20Tomes%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;spell tomes&lt;/a&gt; from the &lt;a href=\"Restoration%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Restoration&lt;/a&gt; discipline, Collette also sells mage &lt;a href=\"apparel\"&gt;apparel&lt;/a&gt; that bolsters Restoration and &lt;a href=\"Magicka%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Magicka&lt;/a&gt;."}

He is one of the main characters of the two novels, and . He was promoted to Inspector rank by &lt;a href=\"Intendant%20Marall\"&gt;Intendant Marall&lt;/a&gt;, and later became one of the best Penitus Oculatus agents. He was then commissioned by the &lt;a href=\"Emperor\"&gt;Emperor&lt;/a&gt; for investigation of Emperor's son, &lt;a href=\"Attrebus%20Mede\"&gt;Attrebus Mede&lt;/a&gt;.\nPhysical appearance.\nColin looks rather nondescript, with green eyes and brown hair.\nHistory.\nEarly life.\nColin grew up in &lt;a href=\"Anvil\"&gt;Anvil&lt;/a&gt;. His father died young, and his mother barely got any money by doing laundry. Colin managed to teach himself to read. &lt;a href=\"Regin%20Oprenus\"&gt;Regin Oprenus&lt;/a&gt;, a city guardsmen of &lt;a href=\"Anvil\"&gt;Anvil&lt;/a&gt; wrote a recommendation to the &lt;a href=\"Penitus%20Oculatus\"&gt;Penitus Oculatus&lt;/a&gt; about Colin, who was trained by them. He specialized in the &lt;a href=\"Thalmor\"&gt;Thalmor&lt;/a&gt;.\n&lt;a href=\"Umbriel%20Crisis\"&gt;Umbriel Crisis&lt;/a&gt;.\nColin was tasked to kill a man as part of his test to become Inspector of the &lt;a href=\"Penitus%20Oculatus\"&gt;Penitus Oculatus&lt;/a&gt;. The man realized that Colin had a knife, so he tried to resist his attack. After a struggle, Colin cut his throat. &lt;a href=\"Arcus\"&gt;Arcus&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Khasha\"&gt;Khasha&lt;/a&gt; came to help Colin to get rid of the body. According to Arcus, it had been quite a fracas. Nonetheless, he was promoted to Inspector.\nColin's third case was to investigate an attack on some Imperial soldiers. He discovered that prince &lt;a href=\"Attrebus%20Mede\"&gt;Attrebus&lt;/a&gt; was among the dead. One of the bodies was wearing the prince's signet, but it was beheaded. It seemed that the authors of the massacre had been &lt;a href=\"the%20Natives\"&gt;the Natives&lt;/a&gt;, an insurgent faction from &lt;a href=\"County%20Skingrad\"&gt;County Skingrad&lt;/a&gt;. Colin spoke to the ghost of one of the soldiers, and he learnt that Attrebus was heading to &lt;a href=\"Black%20Marsh\"&gt;Black Marsh&lt;/a&gt; to stop &lt;a href=\"Umbriel\"&gt;Umbriel&lt;/a&gt;.\nColin attended a meeting with &lt;a href=\"Intendant%20Marall\"&gt;Intendant Marall&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Remar%20Vel\"&gt;Remar Vel&lt;/a&gt;. He was surprised that the &lt;a href=\"Emperor\"&gt;Emperor&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Titus%20Mede%20I\"&gt;Titus Mede I&lt;/a&gt; also attended the meeting. Colin exposed his suspicion that the body they found was not Attrebus. Titus said that the body didn't feel like his son. Remar tried to convince the Emperor that the prince was dead, and when he left the room, he shot an unpleasant look to Colin.\nAfter the meeting, he met &lt;a href=\"Nial%20Sextius\"&gt;Nial Sextius&lt;/a&gt; in an inn. Nial told Colin that Attrebus' life was a lie. His bodyguards knew that he was only allowed to take part in battles where he heavily outnumbered the enemy. His closest man, &lt;a href=\"Gulan\"&gt;Gulan&lt;/a&gt;, informed the Emperor every time Attrebus decided to go on a dangerous adventure and something would happen to stop it. Apparently, this time Gulan hadn't reported about Attrebus' purpose to the Emperor.\nColin discovered that Gulan had informed about Attrebus' plan to a woman named &lt;a href=\"Arese\"&gt;Arese&lt;/a&gt;. Colin sent her some letters blackmailing Arese saying that he knew what she had done. Arese thought that the author of the letters could be one of &lt;a href=\"Calvur\"&gt;Calvur&lt;/a&gt;'s men, so she met them in their hideout. Colin followed Arese, who after walking through the alleyways of the &lt;a href=\"Imperial%20City\"&gt;Imperial City&lt;/a&gt; knocked the door of a house. Someone opened the door, and she entered the building. Colin discovered a window, so he climbed and casted a spell to open it.\nColin hid in the shadows and overheard the conversation between Arese and &lt;a href=\"Calvur\"&gt;Calvur&lt;/a&gt;. He discovered that Arese had hired Calvur and &lt;a href=\"Radhasa\"&gt;Radhasa&lt;/a&gt; to ambush the prince. The conversation between them heated, and Arese summoned a &lt;a href=\"daedra\"&gt;daedra&lt;/a&gt; that killed Calvur and his thugs. Arese felt that there was somebody else in the building. The daedra searched for Colin, who was hidden in the shadows. Arese eventually gave up and burned the building.\nColin was kidnaped by two men while he slept. They narcotized him with a substance that made him sleep. When he woke up, Arese killed the men who had kidnaped her and she removed the sack from his head. Arese's men had discovered Colin spying on her, so they brought him to her. Arese explained to Colin that she had been put in the minister's office ten years ago by the Emperor to spy on Hierem. Hierem wanted Attrebus dead, but she could not have warned Titus about Attrebus' plan without revealing herself to Hierem. Arese offered Colin to work with her to gather proof of Hierem's involvement in Attrebus' attack. Colin didn't have much of an alternative, so he agreed to help Arese.\nColin continued investigating about the Attrebus' case. He discovered that some documents in Hierem's ministry had been censored. Arese explained to him that Hierem had done a secret trip to &lt;a href=\"Black%20Marsh\"&gt;Black Marsh&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href=\"Delia%20Huerc\"&gt;Delia Huerc&lt;/a&gt; had accompanied Hierem in the trip, but she died of an illness a few days after her return. Colin investigated Delia's house. Her home was protected by a daedra that almost killed Colin. Colin ended up defeating the daedra, but he fainted after the battle. When he woke up, Delia's ghost was staring at him. He asked her about her trip to Black Marsh, and she pointed at a baseboard. Colin found a diary, according to it, Hierem had performed a ritual in &lt;a href=\"Lilmoth\"&gt;Lilmoth&lt;/a&gt;'s &lt;a href=\"Hist\"&gt;Hist&lt;/a&gt; tree. Colin went back to Arese's home to report his discovery. However, he noticed that a hooded man had entered the building. Colin broke in through a window. He fought against the assassin, stucking him his knife below his skull. A second assassin attacked him from the rear, but Arese summoned a daedra who killed the last assassin. Arese tried to heal Colin, but the tension of the situation led them to give free rein to pasion.\nColin informed Arese about his discovery, and asked her to contact the Emperor. Arese believed that they needed more evidence, but she finally revealed him the password to speak with the Emperor. Colin met Titus, but the Emperor told him that he needed more proof of Hierem's involvent in the Umbriel Crisis, he could not accuse Hierem without having solid evidence. Before leaving, the Emperor granted Colin a key to Hierem's ministry.\nColin suspected that he could encounter a similar daedra in Hierem's chambers to the one he found in Delia's home. He went to the library of the Penitus Oculatus searching for information. &lt;a href=\"Professor%20Aronil\"&gt;Professor Aronil&lt;/a&gt; asked Colin why he was reading a book about pneumatology. He told Aronil part of the story. Aronil told him that only Hierem had read that book in the last twenty years.\nColin guided Arese through the sewers of the &lt;a href=\"Imperial%20City\"&gt;Imperial City&lt;/a&gt; to a secret room where she could hide. Colin intended to infiltrate in the minister's chambers to search for proof, but Arese thought that the Emperor wanted Colin to kill Hierem. Colin refused to kill the minister unless he was explicitly ordered to do so by the Emperor.\nColin encountered the same type of daedra that he found in Delia's house. He used an &lt;a href=\"Ayleid%20Soul-maze\"&gt;Ayleid Soul-maze&lt;/a&gt; to capture the creature. He discovered some documents that contained the word &lt;a href=\"Umbriel\"&gt;Umbriel&lt;/a&gt;. He copied their content so that Hierem couldn't notice someone had been reading his things. Colin showed his new discovery to Letine. She said that she knew someone who could help them decipher the drawings, so she left the hideout, despite Colin's concern.\nIntendant Marall told Colin about a report that claimed that Prince Attrebus had been seen at the waterfront. Colin return to his hideout. Letine had returned, but she said that she couldn't have deciphered anything. Colin told her about Marall's report, so they prepared to infiltrate Hierem's chambers, in case the prince was being held there.\nColin and Letine discovered Attrebus and Sul imprisoned in Hierem's chambers. Colin managed to force the lock after almost half an hour. They planned to attack Hierem when he teleported back from Umbriel. Sul and Attrebus would in turn be teleported to the flying city.\nColin and Letine surprised Hierem when he returned to his chambers. Colin intended to keep the minister alive, but Letine was determined to kill him. Colin felt a sob heave up from his chest, then he slumped down to the floor. Arese summoned a daedra who attacked Hierem. The daedra wounded him severly, but he managed to defeat it. Hierem asked Letine whether she had discovered what he was up to. Letine told him what she knew. When he was about to kill Arese, Colin threw a knife at Hierem. Hierem noticed Colin's attack, and he dodged the knife. While Hierem was distracted with Colin another daedra butchered Hierem ending with his life.\nColin asked Letine why she hadn't told him about her discovery. Before he could end his question, Letine stabbed him in the lung. Colin fainted, but he waked up some time later. He crossed a hidden door in Hierem\u2019s chambers which led to some stairs. He discoverd Letine performing a ritual at the very axis of the &lt;a href=\"White-Gold%20Tower\"&gt;White-Gold Tower&lt;/a&gt;. She had discovered from Hierem's diagram how to steal the tower's power. Letine loved Colin, and she offered him to join her, but Colin could not let her perform the ritual. Letine started to summon a daedra, but Colin yanked the knife from his chest and aimed it at Letine. The knife hit Letine in the eye, ending with her life. Colin looked through a window and he saw Umbriel vanish. Finally, Colin died with peace.\nMen at his command.\nSome of the men at his command were:"}

Before Ajira can become a Journeyman in the Mages Guild, Ajira must study local mushrooms.\"\nThen to continue the conversation, talk about the mushrooms which will prompt her to say:\n\"To finish Ajira's report, Ajira needs samples of, Luminous Russula, Violet Coprinus, Bungler's Bane and Hypha Facia. Ajira knows you can find all of these in the Bitter Coast. The easiest way is go along the River Odai until you see a Wooden Bridge across the river. Get out of the River there and find a path west over the hills.\"\nShe will give more details about each type of mushroom to look for:\n\"Bungler's Bane grows on trees and sometimes other things. It looks like the tree has brown shelves. Ajira warns you not to eat Bungler's Bane\"\n\"Coprinus comes from long stemmed toadstools that glow blue at night.\"\n\"Russula comes from a short, smelly toadstool which is brown on top.\"\n\"Hypha Facia looks much like Bungler's Bane and grows like a shelf on trees and other things. Hypha Facia is safe to eat but make sure it is not Bungler's Bane.\"\nThe quickest way to get to the locations of these is to take the &lt;a href=\"Silt%20Strider%20%28Morrowind%29\"&gt;silt strider&lt;/a&gt; to Seyda Neen.\nTwo of the mushrooms are growing in the ground next to the tree on the left of the ramp from the silt strider, Luminous Russula and Violet Coprinus.\nHead into Seyda Neen, and go towards the big tree in the center. Near the bottom of the tree are the other two of the four ingredients are growing. Bungler's Bane is attached to the side of the tree. The second mushroom is a very small distance above it and is Hypha Facia.\nHead back to the Mages Guild in Balmora and talk once again to Ajira. Speak to her again about the mushrooms and she will ask:\n\"Do you have samples of all the mushrooms?\"\nAnswer with yes and she will be pleased and say:\n\"Yes, these are all good samples. Now Ajira can write a report and become a Journeyman of the Mages Guild. Ajira has made potions for you to take in return. Ajira is no great alchemist yet, but Ajira thinks you can use these.\"\nReward.\nAjira will give the Nerevarine four &lt;a href=\"Cheap%20Restore%20Health\"&gt;Cheap Restore Health&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Potions%20%28Morrowind%29\"&gt;potions&lt;/a&gt;."}

Due to the region's typically swampy and inhospitable geography, the Legion had serious trouble with organization, especially during battle. The uneven and thick terrain meant that their use of \"rigid line organization\" in clearer areas was no longer applicable. The lack of unity meant giving orders on the battlefield was difficult. This in turn led to numerous failures in battle and many desertions. Thousands of Legionnaires of the Fourth Legion would die during the war because of the Legion's unpreparedness.\nDecimation.\nBy the year &lt;a href=\"1E%202816\"&gt;1E 2816&lt;/a&gt;, all that was left of the Fourth Legion were six ragged cohorts. Morale steadily declined as losses in battle, disease, and disappearances afflicted the Legionnaires. By &lt;a href=\"1E%202820\"&gt;1E 2820&lt;/a&gt;, the Fourth Legion had been almost entirely destroyed, and the few remaining soldiers could not last much longer.\nAt one point, the leader of the Fourth Legion, &lt;a href=\"Augurius%20Bucco\"&gt;Augurius Bucco&lt;/a&gt;, was almost deposed as commander, and orders to withdraw from the deep swamps of Black Marsh were issued. The remnants of the Legion\u2014just over 350 soldiers\u2014made a stop at an ancient Argonian pyramid known as \"&lt;a href=\"Xi-tsei\"&gt;Xi-tsei&lt;/a&gt;\" on the tenth day of withdrawal, with the intention of continuing the retreat onward to &lt;a href=\"Cyrodiil\"&gt;Cyrodiil&lt;/a&gt;. However, on the night of &lt;a href=\"Last%20Seed\"&gt;Last Seed&lt;/a&gt; 14, 1E 2820, the few surviving troops were all killed, presumably by Argonian forces. Mysteriously, the bodies of roughly 150 of them were never discovered, and no indication whatsoever of their whereabouts was recorded.\nSecond campaign.\nAfter word of the Fourth Legion's utter annihilation reached Cyrodiil, the Fourth Legion was reconstituted by the &lt;a href=\"Imperial%20Council\"&gt;Imperial Council&lt;/a&gt;, this time commanded by General &lt;a href=\"Regulus%20Sardecus\"&gt;Regulus Sardecus&lt;/a&gt;. Thus began the second campaign of the Blackwater War.\nReorganization.\nUnder Sardecus' leadership, the newly recreated Fourth Legion quickly resumed fighting in Black Marsh, regaining all previously-lost territory by &lt;a href=\"1E%202823\"&gt;1E 2823&lt;/a&gt;. This is largely credited to Sardecus' orders that Legionnaires were to switch out their metal armor for \"padded leather jackets,\" which were more suited to the Argonian climate. Additionally, efforts were made to improve communications between Imperial quartermasters, scouts, and Argonian \"irregulars.\" The Legion learned how to live off the land rather than rely purely on imported supplies.\nSardecus also decreed that Centurions and Legates were to be allowed more control over their own groups of soldiers, thus allowing for more organized independent fighting. Sardecus was also quick to strip a soldier of their rank if they did not adhere to his methods. This system served to both improve the efficiency and the morale of the Legionnaires.\nSuccesses.\nThe most successful way that Sardecus overcame his opponents was actually through diplomacy rather than brute force. Unlike his predecessor, he was aware that the Argonians were not in fact a fully unified, barbaric people. Many influential tribes who were considered \"disenfranchised\" (such as the &lt;a href=\"Archeins\"&gt;Archeins&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Shoss-kaleel\"&gt;Shoss-kaleel&lt;/a&gt; tribes) were offered various rewards for assisting the Legion in its conquests. In some circumstances, even full military alliances were formed. Nearly tripling the Legion's manpower, and at last giving the Imperials a great advantage in the war.\nThe militaristic strategy of Sardecus and the Fourth Legion worked on the idea that the Argonian swamps were the most dangerous force to be faced. The strategy also focussed on rendering sources of food, cover, and travel useless to the Argonians.\nSecond retreat.\nAfter setting ablaze an expansive underground tunnel system, the Legion realized that the tunnels had been much father-reaching than anticipated; what started as just another attack led to much of the region being entirely engulfed in flames. As a result of the fire, hundreds of Legion soldiers and Argonians alike were devastated by frequent deaths by \"swamp lung\" and gas explosions, leading to a second retreat and subsequently Sardecus' death by an \"infected wound\" during the return to Cyrodiil.\nThird campaign.\nThe Fourth Legion's strategy had again been altered by &lt;a href=\"1E%202833\"&gt;1E 2833&lt;/a&gt;, at which point General Lucinia Falco had succeeded Sardecus as commander of the Fourth Legion. Falco split up her soldiers into hundreds of small, highly lethal groups, later called \"redbelts,\" in place of the full Legion. The prowess of these so-called \"redbelts\" was strengthened by the experience and knowledge of \"grizzled swamp veterans,\" some of whom had been fighting in the war since the second campaign.\nAlthough much progress was made at the beginning of the campaign through the use of this system, captured territory was held very loosely by the Fourth Legion. Eventually, the conflict escalated to an all-out guerrilla war, and tactics such as fierce intimidation were often used. By late &lt;a href=\"1E%202836\"&gt;1E 2836&lt;/a&gt;, however, the Argonians abruptly ceased fighting, and by &lt;a href=\"1E%202837\"&gt;1E 2837&lt;/a&gt;\u00a0the Empire had effectively secured full control over the region."}

And thereafter did Long-Launcher sigh when it was borne, and moan when it was shot. And Ysgramor decided to take it hunting.\nAnd he hunted and slew much game in the &lt;a href=\"Atmoran\"&gt;Atmoran&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Frostwood\"&gt;Frostwood&lt;/a&gt;, until he paused at a ford to drink his fill. Then across the stream bounded the &lt;a href=\"White%20Stag\"&gt;White Stag&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"Forelgrim\"&gt;Forelgrim&lt;/a&gt;, and Ysgramor shot at it and missed, which in no wise pleased him, and he swore to pursue the White Stag until it fell to him. But the stag was canny and quiet, and passed as a mist over the snow, so that Ysgramor did again and again sight it and lose it. For even the sighing of the Woeful Bowstring made more sound than did the White Stag.\nWhen again he lost the trail and stopped, sore vexed, an Hare did appear and spake, saying, \"The stag hieth down into yon vale.\" \"How knoweth you this?\" demanded Ysgramor of the Hare, which replied, \"I know for I have long ears. Yea, had you ears as long as mine, you too could hear your prey wherever it went.\"\n\"Would, then,\" said Ysgramor, \"that my ears were as long as thine.\" At that the Hare's nose did twitch, and Ysgramor felt his ears begin to grow and point. But a Fox did leap from the coppice and fall upon the Hare, slaying it, and Ysgramor, in wonder, felt his ears dwindle to their wonted size.\nAnd the Fox spake, saying, \"Know thou, mortal, that I am &lt;a href=\"Shor\"&gt;Shor&lt;/a&gt;, and this was nary Hare, but indeed, &lt;a href=\"Herma-Mora\"&gt;Herma Mora&lt;/a&gt;, who did nearly trick thee into becoming of &lt;a href=\"Mer\"&gt;Elvenkind&lt;/a&gt;.

So I (set aside) scroll and plume, grasped the finial and lifted the lid.\n(Within the urn) was a viscous and noisome (fluid), upon which floated, gray and glistening, a mortal's (organ of thought). And I knew, though I know not how, that the (fluid) was not brine, and the brain was not preserved, but alive, alert, and brooding with a dark intellect. I dropped the lid and (looked up from) the urn, and saw, (beyond the plinth), a long and endless corridor, lined left and right with plinths uncountable, and (upon each plinth was) its urn.\n(Which was why, when) I awoke, my tongue was bitten through."}

He was born in &lt;a href=\"1E%20720\"&gt;1E 720&lt;/a&gt;, in the region of High Desert, on the continent of &lt;a href=\"Yokuda\"&gt;Yokuda&lt;/a&gt;. He grew up in a period of constant turmoil, the civil war in Yokuda, and led his people from the annihilation they faced to their new home in &lt;a href=\"Hammerfell\"&gt;Hammerfell&lt;/a&gt;. He is also famous as being the father of his son, &lt;a href=\"Divad%20Hunding\"&gt;Divad&lt;/a&gt;.\nHistory.\nGrowing up.\nFrandar belonged to the &lt;a href=\"Sword-Singers\"&gt;Sword-Singers&lt;/a&gt;. This faction, initially loyal to the Yokudan Empire, originally came from the high-class members of society. They devised training called \"&lt;a href=\"The%20Hall%20of%20the%20Virtues%20of%20War\"&gt;The Hall of the Virtues of War&lt;/a&gt;.\" Frandar was a master &lt;a href=\"Ansei\"&gt;Ansei&lt;/a&gt; (the most skillful of the Sword-Singers) at the height of the turmoil of Torn's death. Many Ansei had hung up their swords and became master artisans instead. Some, however, like Hunding, sought true enlightenment through the dark times.\nIn &lt;a href=\"1E%20734\"&gt;1E 734&lt;/a&gt;, Hunding's father died in one of the many uprisings in revolt of the death of &lt;a href=\"Randic%20Torn\"&gt;Randic Torn&lt;/a&gt;, leaving him to look after his four brothers and mother, which he did through his knowledge of the sword. He was in great demand as a guardian and escort, but his reputation preceded him, and multitudes awaited to face him in battle, as they would gain instant fame through defeating him.\nBy &lt;a href=\"1E%20750\"&gt;1E 750&lt;/a&gt;, Frandar has fought and won more than ninety duels. Nearly invincible with the sword, he gained such prestige and mastery that he eventually stopped needing to use real swords. He created, and began to use, the Shehai, or \"Way of the Spirit Sword.\" He started using this around his ninetieth duel. During this duel, he had fought the evil Lord &lt;a href=\"Janic\"&gt;Janic&lt;/a&gt; and his seven &lt;a href=\"Lich\"&gt;Lich&lt;/a&gt;es in the process.\nThe Shehai.\nThe Shehai is a magical mastery whereby the image of a sword is formed from &lt;a href=\"Willpower\"&gt;pure thought&lt;/a&gt;. All sword singers eventually learn this \"through the intense training and devotion to the gods of war and the way of the sword.\" The Shehai is able to concentrate and create the sword, and it takes shape in his hand, usually as a \"pale thing of light, misty and insubstantial, a thing of beauty perhaps, but no weapon.\" Those Ansei of the highest level, and those of sensitivity and talent in magic, can in times of great stress, form a Spirit Sword. The Shehai, which is far more than mere light and air, but rather, an unstoppable weapon of great might, and a weapon which \"can never be taken from the owner without also taking his mind.\" This, then, is what Frandar was able to use.\nRetirement.\nAfter he was satisfied that he was, indeed, invincible, Frandar turned his thoughts towards the philosophy of the \"Way of the Spirit Sword.\" He wrote his learning down in the \"&lt;a href=\"Book%20of%20Circles\"&gt;Book of Circles&lt;/a&gt;\" whilst living as a hermit in a mountains of high desert in &lt;a href=\"1E%20780\"&gt;1E 780&lt;/a&gt;\u00a0In that year, after having enlisted in, and fought, many battles of the empire (and winning all of them)\u2014had thought himself ready for death, and retired to the cave in order to write his strategy and &lt;a href=\"Mysticism\"&gt;mystical visions&lt;/a&gt; to share with the other Sword-Singers. After completion of this scroll, the Singers, one of them his own son, Divad sought him out, as they urgently needed his help.\nArmy of the Circle.\n&lt;a href=\"Torn%27s%20Sword-Hunt\"&gt;Torn's Sword-Hunt&lt;/a&gt; had separated the Singers from the common people, and the rise of the \"Last Emperor of Yokuda\" created strife in the desert empire. The &lt;a href=\"Hira\"&gt;Emperor Hira&lt;/a&gt;, and his consort, Elisa's effort to take control of the empire, and put a stop to the insurrection, was to destroy the Sword Singers. He vowed that he would \"search out every Singer\" with his Brigand army, which was composed of &lt;a href=\"Orsimer\"&gt;Orcs&lt;/a&gt; and castoffs of the wars of the Empire, and to \"scourge them from the face of the planet.\"\nThe Sword-Singers, being peoples from the desert, were not particularly numerous, as the harsh landscape kept births few, however \"growing up in the unforgiving wastes eliminated all but those of iron spirit and will.\" Thus the final strife which became known as the \"War of the Singers,\" and these people were unprepared and unready to join together their individually great skills into an army that could defend their homes and lives.\nDue to his legend of being invincible on the battlefield, he was sought out, and without a choice in the matter, he was given command of the Singers. It is lucky for them that he had time to write down his years of accumulated wisdom, strategy, and ways of the Shehai, because his people fled to Mount Hattu, the \"Father of the Mountains.\" He was able to form the remnants of the Singers into the &lt;a href=\"Army%20of%20the%20Circle\"&gt;Army of the Circle&lt;/a&gt;, named after his book, and the people learnt Hunding's Way, of his strategy and visions, as written in his \"Book of Circles\", and his vision for a master stroke of victory, for the War of the Singers.\nWar of the Singers.\nFrandar then formulated a plan, to be fought in a total of seven battles, to lead the Armies of Hira further and further into the wilderness, to the foot of Mount Hattu, where the final battle was to be fought. This plan he called the \"Hammer and the Anvil.\" With each battle, the Army of the Circle, the untrained, undisciplined group of warriors that was his people, would learn more about his strategies and tactics, and grow stronger in the use of the Shehai, and be ready to defeat Hira's forces by the seventh battle. The battles progressed, and neither side was able to claim victory or defeat, but only able to slow down the progress of Hira's forces, with his large force advancing on the smaller army of Hunding. Though outnumbered thirty to one, his forces never faltered, and continued with his plan, and when his army maneuvered to the base of &lt;a href=\"Battle%20of%20Hattu%20Mountain\"&gt;Hattu Mountain&lt;/a&gt;, the \"Hammer\" blow was delivered. The battle began, and many singers died, but Frandar Hunding knew, that, although few of his army would survive the battle (due to impossible differences in numbers), if successful, Hira and his army would not survive.\nAftermath of the Battle.\nIn the aftermath of the battle, fewer than twenty thousand Singers survived, but there was no army left to pillage and murder. Hunding\u00a0rallied the Ra Gada to exterminate the goblins, but was killed in battle by the 8-foot abominations of the &lt;a href=\"Flint-Tooth%20Tribe\"&gt;Flint-Tooth Tribe&lt;/a&gt;. Following his father's death, Divad, rose to command the Ra Gada. There were more than 300,000 dead that day on the battlefield. Of the survivors, they were no longer an organized band of bandits.\nThe Singers, though, mourned their losses and followed Hunding to the great port city of &lt;a href=\"Arch\"&gt;Arch&lt;/a&gt;, in the province of &lt;a href=\"Seawind\"&gt;Seawind&lt;/a&gt;, where he had a flotilla of ships waiting. Knowing that they could no longer live in the desert empire, they left their homeland in search of a new one. The acts of Hunding, the Singers of Shehai, the \"Book of Circles\" and much more was unappreciated by the people, and thus they left their homeland. From there, the people left their homeland, of Yokuda, vowing to learn new ways as they travelled across the ocean. The vowed to adopt a new name, but to still honour the past. In honour of their final battle on Yokuda, they named the new land Hammerfell, and they adopted the name Redguards, as the Yokudans saw them as blood-red peoples, and they had guarded them from the evils of Hira. In honour of Hunding, the great \"Warrior-Prince,\" each household in Hammerfell reportedly has a place by the hearth with an alcove big enough to hold the scroll known as the Book of Circles.\nLegacy.\nThere is no understating his legacy in &lt;a href=\"Tamriel\"&gt;Tamriel&lt;/a&gt;. Without him, the Sword Singers would never have defeated the Armies of Hira, and would never have left their homeland of Yokuda, as they would all have perished. They would never have arrived in Hammerfell, and thus the many accomplishments on Tamriel that have been achieved by the Redguards, and any involvement in any event or battle, would not have occurred.\nHe also passed down a wealth of knowledge about swords and sword-fighting. As quoted by Lady Benoch, in \"&lt;a href=\"Words%20and%20Philosophy\"&gt;Words and Philosophy&lt;/a&gt;\":\n\"\"\"Frandar Hunding,\" she says. \"Lists thirty-eight grips, seven hundred and fifty offensive and eighteen hundred defensive positions, and nearly nine thousand moves essential to sword mastery. The average hack-and-slasher knows one grip, which he uses primarily to keep from dropping his blade. He knows one offensive position, facing his target, and one defensive position, fleeing. Of the multitudinous rhythms and inflections of combat, he knows less than one.\"\"\nOn &lt;a href=\"Stros%20M%27kai\"&gt;Stros M'kai&lt;/a&gt;, a city named &lt;a href=\"Port%20Hunding\"&gt;Port Hunding&lt;/a&gt; was settled, the Statue of Hunding Bay was erected and Hunding Bay were all named after him.\nDivad.\nFrandar's Son, Divad (also known as \"Divad the Singer\"), was born in &lt;a href=\"1E%20760\"&gt;1E 760&lt;/a&gt;. Like his father he also learnt at the &lt;a href=\"The%20Hall%20of%20the%20Virtues%20of%20War\"&gt;The Hall of the Virtues of War&lt;/a&gt;. He is believed to have secretly studied the Shehai Shen She Ru\u2014the Way of the Spirit Sword, or simply the Shehai). The Emperor Hira attempted to assassinate him but was unsuccessful, and, the Sword Singers, under siege from this Emperor, beseeched Divad's father, Frandar Hunding, for help, climbing his Mount Hattu retreat. Initially, Frandar refused, but, eventually, relented, and devised the strategy known as the Hammer and the Anvil. Frandar has by this stage completed his magnum opus, the Book of Circles which then became compulsory reading for the Redguard peoples. Divad supposedly became increasingly famous, however, what he did to increase his stature over that of his father is not known."}

Dren will inform the Nerevarine that a slave, &lt;a href=\"Hides-His-Foot\"&gt;Hides-His-Foot&lt;/a&gt;, can be found at the &lt;a href=\"Dren%20Plantation%20%28Morrowind%29\"&gt;Dren Plantation&lt;/a&gt; and requires assistance in order to be freed.\nFreeing the slave.\nHides-His-Foot can be found in the open grounds near the plantation. If the Nerevarine talks to him and commands him to follow, five guards will attack Hides-His-Foot. If the Nerevarine tries to defend Hides-His-Foot by attacking the guards, he will be expelled from House Hlaalu.\nHides-His-Foot can be defeated very quickly, so the Nerevarine must either be very quick in killing the guards, or ensure they do not attack. This may be achieved by using &lt;a href=\"Command%20Humanoid%20%28Morrowind%29\"&gt;Command Humanoid&lt;/a&gt; spells like &lt;a href=\"Command%20of%20the%20Third%20Corner\"&gt;Command of the Third Corner&lt;/a&gt;:\nAnother approach is to tell Hides-His-Foot to follow, which activates the guards, and then tell him to wait. The Nerevarine can then engage all of them away from Hides-His-Foot. Since they are already hostile, killing them in this circumstance does not incur a bounty.\nReaching the farmhouse.\nOnce instructed, Hides-His-Foot will follow the Nerevarine to Sterdecan's farmhouse, a little way northeast of the plantation. After passing the door to the farmhouse, Hides-His-Foot will be under the protection of the farmer and the Nerevarine will be able to return to Dren to complete the quest."}
