When he is first met, Baurus suspects someone is following him. Follow Baurus and the man who is spying on him. Eventually the spy must be killed.\nSearch the spy's body to find \"&lt;a href=\"Mythic%20Dawn%20Commentaries%201\"&gt;Mythic Dawn Commentaries 1&lt;/a&gt;\". Baurus will talk about &lt;a href=\"Tar-Meena\"&gt;Tar-Meena&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;a href=\"Arcane%20University%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;Arcane University&lt;/a&gt;, so seek her to obtain more information on the Mythic Dawn cult.\nSpeaking to Tar-Meena.\nThe secret of this cult lies in the four commentaries on the \"&lt;a href=\"Mysterium%20Xarxes\"&gt;Mysterium Xarxes&lt;/a&gt;\" written by &lt;a href=\"Mankar%20Camoran%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;Mankar Camoran&lt;/a&gt;. All four copies are needed and Tar-Meena gives the Hero the second volume, \"&lt;a href=\"Mythic%20Dawn%20Commentaries%202\"&gt;Mythic Dawn Commentaries 2&lt;/a&gt;\".\nThe third volume, \"&lt;a href=\"Mythic%20Dawn%20Commentaries%203\"&gt;Mythic Dawn Commentaries 3&lt;/a&gt;\", can be obtained by persuading &lt;a href=\"Phintias\"&gt;Phintias&lt;/a&gt; at the &lt;a href=\"First%20Edition%20%28Location%29\"&gt;First Edition&lt;/a&gt; bookstore to give up his only copy if his disposition with the &lt;a href=\"Hero%20of%20Kvatch\"&gt;Hero&lt;/a&gt; is 80 or higher. Eventually he will sell it for 100 . Wait for the original buyer, &lt;a href=\"Gwinas\"&gt;Gwinas&lt;/a&gt;, to question him about his interest in the cult.\nA cheaper option is to wait in the bookstore until Gwinas arrives to claim the book. Follow Gwinas out of the store and talk to him about the book. Ask Gwinas about the \"&lt;a href=\"Mythic%20Dawn\"&gt;Mythic Dawn&lt;/a&gt;\" and tell him that he is \"in way over his head\". (It may be necessary to raise his &lt;a href=\"disposition\"&gt;disposition&lt;/a&gt; before starting the conversation.) Let him know that the cult is responsible for the murder of the &lt;a href=\"Uriel%20Septim%20VII\"&gt;Emperor&lt;/a&gt;. Gwinas will panic and give away the book, as well as a note with directions on how to meet \"&lt;a href=\"Raven%20Camoran\"&gt;The Sponsor&lt;/a&gt;.\"\nA third option is to steal the book, it is kept in a chest near Phintias with a lock so a few lockpicks may be required.\nA fourth option is to kill Gwinas. Follow him from the book store, let him go to sleep in his hotel room (he lives at the &lt;a href=\"Tiber%20Septim%20Hotel\"&gt;Tiber Septim Hotel&lt;/a&gt;), pick his lock and kill him. Then take the book and the letter from the sponsor.\nThe fourth volume, \"&lt;a href=\"Mythic%20Dawn%20Commentaries%204\"&gt;Mythic Dawn Commentaries 4&lt;/a&gt;\", can only be obtained from the meeting with \"The Sponsor.\"\nMeeting with The Sponsor.\nGo and see &lt;a href=\"Baurus\"&gt;Baurus&lt;/a&gt; once the 3rd volume is obtained. He will say \"You not easy to get a hold of\" no matter what. He asks the Hero to follow him into the sewers as he knows them well and he will take the lead to the &lt;a href=\"Imperial%20City%2C%20Elven%20Gardens%20District\"&gt;Elven Gardens District&lt;/a&gt;, to a sewer entrance. Note that while the journal says \"I should see Baurus first\", the \"should\" really is a \"must.\" If the Hero goes to the Sunken Sewers before seeing Baurus, the sponsor will not be present and the gates will be locked with \"need a key\" gates. The Hero may choose to do this anyway, clearing out all opponents before meeting with Baurus, and then retracing their steps with him.\nWhen walking through the sewers mud crabs, &lt;a href=\"Rat%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;rats&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Goblin%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;goblins&lt;/a&gt; will attack. Depending on level, Baurus can be knocked unconscious by the goblins who also are leveled, try and dispose of them quickly. Baurus heals himself outside the final room and says he will face &lt;a href=\"Raven%20Camoran\"&gt;the Sponsor&lt;/a&gt; alone so wait upstairs.\nOptions.\nIf Baurus survives, he will comment that \"That's three more that won't report back to their master.\" The next time the Hero will see him will be at the Cloud Ruler Temple and he will provide some training that will increase the blade skill.\nMeet Tar-Meena.\nExit the sewers and travel back to the Arcane University. Talk to Tar-Meena and she says to come back the next day. After the first day, she will give a hint that the first word each paragraph in the books is important.\nDeciphering the four volumes.\nAfter waiting a second day, Tar-Meena will ask for the third and fourth books in the Hero's possession and reveal the clue on finding the Mythic Dawn's secret shrine: the first letter of each paragraph spells out \"Green Emperor Way Where Tower Touches Midday Sun.\"\nFollowing the Clue.\nTravel to &lt;a href=\"Green%20Emperor%20Way\"&gt;Green Emperor Way&lt;/a&gt; and look for the &lt;a href=\"Tomb%20of%20Prince%20Camarril\"&gt;Tomb of Prince Camarril&lt;/a&gt;. The tomb is between the exits to Talos Plaza and Temple District \u2013 it is the large circular tomb there. Between 11:45am and 12:30pm, a map will glow red on the stone. Examine it and the quest will be updated. It is a map to the Mythic Dawn's Dagon Shrine and this will begin the next stage of the main quest."}

Storn suggested that the wizard Neloth may know the location of the Black Books that I need.\"\nWalkthrough.\nConsulting Neloth.\n&lt;a href=\"Storn%20Crag-Strider\"&gt;Storn Crag-Strider&lt;/a&gt;\u00a0suggests heading to &lt;a href=\"Tel%20Mithryn\"&gt;Tel Mithryn&lt;/a&gt; to ask Master &lt;a href=\"Neloth%20%28Dragonborn%29\"&gt;Neloth&lt;/a&gt; about where to find the Black Books. After entering the door at the base, a magic elevator allows the Dragonborn to float up to the top, where Neloth is. He reveals that the books are artifacts of &lt;a href=\"Hermaeus%20Mora%20%28Dragonborn%29\"&gt;Hermaeus Mora&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"Daedric%20Prince\"&gt;Daedric Prince&lt;/a&gt; of fate and knowledge:\nI hear you know where to find Black Books. \"You refer to the tomes of esoteric knowledge that old Hermaeus Mora has scattered throughout the world? What could you know of them?\"\nIn addition to the above option, one of two specific options are available, depending upon the status of Hermaeus Mora's Daedric quest \"&lt;a href=\"Discerning%20the%20Transmundane\"&gt;Discerning the Transmundane&lt;/a&gt;\".\nIf \"Discerning the Transmundane\" has been completed and \"&lt;a href=\"Oghma%20Infinium%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Oghma Infinium&lt;/a&gt;\" is read:\nI've dealt with Hermaeus Mora before. I've read the Oghma Infinium. \"Have you? The actual Oghma Infinium? That's... I've searched for it myself for many years without success...Well then, you should know better than anyone that Hermaeus Mora is not to be trifled with. But he is subtler than most of the other Daedric Princes, as you would expect of the prince of knowledge and fate. You seem to have escaped the fate of many who find themselves ensnared forever by the lure of his secrets. Or... perhaps not.\"\nIf \"Discerning the Transmundane\" has not been completed:\nWho is Hermaeus Mora? \"If you have to ask that, you'd probably be best leaving his books to wiser heads than yours. Like all Daedric Princes, he's not to be trifled with. But he is subtler than most of his ilk, appropriate for the prince of knowledge and fate. Many scholars and loremasters have been ensnared by the lure of learning the secrets that only Hermaeus Mora possesses. But don't worry. I have no intention of joining them in their endless search throughout the infinite halls of Apocrypha.\"\nNext the conversation follows with:\nI have to know what Miraak knows if I want to stop him. \"Miraak? The one all the townsfolk are always chanting about?\"\nAlternatively, Neloth may reply to the initial option with: \"Now that is a dangerous path indeed. Hermaeus Mora gives nothing away for free. You may end up like Miraak, of course. Two power-mad Dragonborn. It could be very interesting.\"\nNext the conversation moves towards the Black Books again. He admits to owning one, and knowing\u00a0the location of another:\nDo you know where I can find another Black Book? \"Oh yes. They're not hard to locate once you know how to look for them. I have one here that I have been using to locate more.\"\nAfter the conversation has finished, Neloth leaves for &lt;a href=\"Nchardak\"&gt;Nchardak&lt;/a&gt;, located north of Tel Mithryn, along the coast and relatively close. Upon leaving the mushroom tower, it is possible that the Dragonborn will be accosted by &lt;a href=\"Talvas%20Fathryon\"&gt;Talvas Fathryon&lt;/a&gt; and the side quest \"&lt;a href=\"From%20the%20Ashes\"&gt;From the Ashes&lt;/a&gt;\" will start.\nIf &lt;a href=\"Varona%20Nelas%20%28Dragonborn%29\"&gt;Varona Nelas'&lt;/a&gt; corpse is outside Tel Mithryn (\"&lt;a href=\"Reluctant%20Steward\"&gt;Reluctant Steward&lt;/a&gt;\"), Neloth will ignore it completely.\nCity of a Hundred Towers.\nUpon reaching Nchardak, Neloth will comment: \"The Dwemer certainly knew how to build for the ages. These towers have outlasted their creators by millennia. The book is housed inside that dome. I'll need to unlock the door for us. Lets get on with it.\" At this point, Neloth will follow the Dragonborn and may be accompanied by his own &lt;a href=\"Ash%20Guardian\"&gt;Ash Guardian&lt;/a&gt;. Up the main stairs, the various &lt;a href=\"Reaver%20%28Dragonborn%29\"&gt;Reavers&lt;/a&gt; that have taken up residence in the grounds of the ruin need to be eliminated.\nUpon reaching the main door, Neloth will remark: \"The Dwemer of Nchardak appear to have been fond of these control pedestals. Luckily I found a cube to operate it inside on my last visit. I sealed the door when I left to keep out ignorant meddlers. Let me unlock it. The book is just inside.\"\nNchardak Reading Room.\nOnce he unlocks the door, the path to the Reading Room is open. Upon approaching the large gold ring in the center of the room, Neloth will comment: \"\"You can see the book right there. So tantalizingly close... But trust me, no magic will open that. I'd have had the book already if I could. No, we'll have to do this the hard way. If we can restore the steam supply to this room, I'm certain I can open it. As you'll see, that's easier said than done. This way to the boilers.\" \"\nNeloth then uses his cube to open another door that houses an elevator leading to the Nchardak Great Chamber. He commands the Dragonborn, \"Follow me.\"\nNchardak Great Chamber.\nWhile following him down the halls, he will comment: \"The last time I was here, I only explored a small part of the ruins. I was here alone then, and I find an assistant is absolutely essential for this kind of dirty, dangerous work.\"\nUpon reaching the main chamber he will exclaim: \"Nchardak, The 'City of a Hundred Towers'. In its day it was the largest of the great Dwemer Archives and perhaps the most advanced. In the old stories, when the Nords came to conquer it, it's said the Dwemer submerged the entire city beneath the sea until the invaders gave up. I have my doubts. But the city was a marvel of Dwemer engineering. Now reduced to this. As you can see, most of the lower levels of the city are flooded. but it isn't hopeless - the old Dwemer pumps still seem to work. Watch.\"\nNeloth then walks over to a control pedestal overlooking a large flooded area of the chamber and activates is with his cube. The water flooding the chamber partially drains out, however he reveals: \"The pumps only operate when a cube is in the pedestal. And unfortunately, I have only one cube. These four boilers provide steam to the room upstairs. They're shut down, but they still respond to the control cubes. So, if we can find four more cubes, we can turn these boilers back on and restore steam power to the room upstairs. Then I should be able to open the book's protective case. Bring that cube. We'll need it.\"\nAfter picking up the cube from the pedestal, Neloth can be followed to a display panel, where he explains: \"Yes... here we are. This device shows the location of four more cubes in this section of the city. It looks like most of the cubes were moved to the lower levels, perhaps to try to control the flooding before the city was abandoned. Interesting. That would suggest that the city must have originally sunk during the first cataclysm of Red Mountain. Or that the Dwemer's servitors continued to try to preserve the city after their creators' disappearance.\"\nNext he walks over to the sealed door to the Nchardak Workshop and remarks \"Three of the cubes are through here. This seems like a sensible place to start. You should be able to unseal this door with the control cube I gave you.\"\nPlacing the cube in the control switch will remove the seals and allow the Dragonborn to enter the workshop with Neloth. At this point, it is possible to ask him to explain the details again, via two dialogue options. These are:\nHow do we get the book out of its case? \"It won't be easy. The whole lower part of the city is flooded, which has shut down the boilers which supply steam to the reading room. If we can restore the steam supply, I'm certain I can open the book's protective case.\"\nNchardak Workshop.\nUpon entering the workshop, Neloth will be standing next to another control cube he has found. He remarks: \"I hope the rest of the cubes are this easy to find. Although knowing the Dwemer, I rather doubt it.\"\nTaking the cube from the pedestal will stop the fire traps ahead, allowing Neloth to be followed to the next area. After defeating some &lt;a href=\"Dwarven%20Spider%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Dwemer Spiders&lt;/a&gt;, a bridge is reached. As Neloth walks across the bridge, he observes the automatons lining the walls and comments: \"\"These must be the \"Great Workshops of Nchardak.\" Impressive even in ruins. In the city's days of glory, it was reputed to be able to assemble a complete automaton in a single day. Much of the Dwemer army at the Battle of Red Mountain must have come from here.\" \"\nAt the end of the bridge are two more control pedestals. Neloth remarks: \"It looks like we'll need to lower the water level to make any more progress.\" Placing a cube in either pedestal will lower the water. Several automatons will attack. Once they are defeated, placing a cube in the control switch immediately at the bottom of the stairs will make a set of stairs to the north appear. However, the stairs are blocked by a brass bridge. Heading up and around the walkway to the brass bridge and placing the cube in another control switch will raise the bridge. It then is possible to return to the previous control switch and climb the stairs to the door.\nUp the stairs to the right (east) then right again (south) leads to a room with an adept-locked chest. Going to the left (west), then south leads to a small enclosed cage where another control cube can be found. Taking this cube will cause the water to rise again and a few spiders to attack. Heading back up to the east end of the bridge and taking the original cube from the pedestal causes the water level to raise much higher than what it was originally. Neloth then leads the Dragonborn to a door on the south side of the room. Upon opening it, a series of underwater halls are seen. Swimming through the halls, fighting off the Dwemer Spiders along the way, leads to the fourth cube found in a pedestal against the north wall of the room. Taking the cube will cause the water level to raise again and a Dwarven Centurion to awaken and attack. Once it has been defeated, the nearby staircase against the west wall leads up to the south, then east. Another Dwarven automaton protects a control switch to the north that, when activated, drops a bridge that leads to a door back to the Great Chamber.\nThe Final Cube.\nOnce in the Great Chamber, Neloth will walk over to the large flooded area and mention the last cube is through the northern door, but the water level must be lowered to reach it. Placing two cubes on the pedestals on the upper area will completely drain the water from this chamber. Neloth will now lead the Dragonborn down the stairs. After defeating the two Dwarven Ballistae guarding the northern door, the control switch nearby can be activated to open the seal to the Nchardak Aqueduct.\nInside the aqueduct, Neloth spots the pump activator where water can be drained, but reaching it requires solving a small puzzle to lower the three bridges that lead to it. Turning around to the south, there is a ramp leading up to the three control switches overlooking the aqueduct. The combination to lower all three bridges is simply the right switch, then the left switch. Once the bridges lower, several automatons appear.\nAcross the bridges from the floor level, a control switch is now visible on the western end of the room. When activated, it will open a door that leads up a ramp and turns left (south) to a small room lined with traps. The first trap is a pressure plate that activates iron bars that slam shut near the entrance. The next is two spinning blades in front of the gate that holds the final cube. Finally, another pressure plate lies near the pedestal; it activates poisoned arrows when stepped upon. Taking the cube will cause the water level to rise. Swim back to the main aqueduct chamber, where Neloth was waiting. Once he sees that the final cube has been obtained, he will remove the control cube from the pump activator to raise the water much higher than before. It is then possible to swim back to the entrance to the Nchardak Great Chamber.\nAt the top of the southern ramp (upon which there are more automatons) are the main control pedestals. After taking one of the original cubes already in the pedestals, a circular platform to the lower west will be revealed; upon it are the boiler control pedestals. Placing the remaining four cubes in the pedestals will start all the boilers. A bridge will then lower on the far west of the chamber to reveal a Dwarven Centurion. Once it is defeated, Neloth will remark: \"I'm going to head back upstairs and see if the reading room has steam. If so, it should be a simple matter to release the book.\" Before heading back to the Nchardak Reading Room, a chest found in the centurion's holding area across the bridge can be searched for some leveled loot. After that, proceeding east, then south, leads to a lever that, when activated, brings the Dragonborn to the reading room.\nRetrieve the Black Book.\nIn the reading room Neloth will be waiting by a control pedestal. Pressing the button results in four beams of light appearing from the floor to focus on a large crystal above. This causes the room to rumble and the book to rise out from the sealed compartment. Neloth remarks: \"At last. I hope it was worth it. Please... be my guest. You deserve the first look. Besides, it could be very dangerous. These books are known to drive many people insane.\" This completes the quest and immediately starts the next quest. \"&lt;a href=\"The%20Gardener%20of%20Men\"&gt;The Gardener of Men&lt;/a&gt;.\""}

Either outcome will be a welcome respite from the days and nights I've spent toiling without food, water, or any kind of companionship. A lesser mage would have fallen prey to madness by now, I'm sure of it. But I am not a lesser mage! Though they try in earnest, though their hearts and minds are true to the teachings of our great &lt;a href=\"Mannimarco%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;Sovereign&lt;/a&gt;, my fellow &lt;a href=\"Necromancer%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;Necromancers&lt;/a&gt; lack the complete dedication required to achieve that ultimate of goals -- the state of lichdom. Not even &lt;a href=\"Falcar\"&gt;Falcar&lt;/a&gt; himself can match my sheer tenacity, my unwillingness to accept failure on any level. That is why I, &lt;a href=\"Celedaen\"&gt;Celedaen&lt;/a&gt;, will soon join the ranks of the &lt;a href=\"Order%20of%20the%20Black%20Worm\"&gt;Worm Eremites&lt;/a&gt;, those servants favored by our sovereign above all others. I will sit with honor and obedience at his right hand while those fools in the &lt;a href=\"Mages%20Guild%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;Mages Guild&lt;/a&gt; grovel at my maggot-ridden feet!\nEntry 2:.\nEven the most pedestrian peasant fairy tale has long held that a &lt;a href=\"Lich%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;lich&lt;/a&gt; must somehow remain bound to his soul, and that connection most commonly manifests itself as a transference of the spirit into an actual physical object. An urn, a sarcophagus, a crystal phial... One &lt;a href=\"Khajiit%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;Khajiit&lt;/a&gt; fairy tale even tells of a lich who preserved his spirit in the severed head of a &lt;a href=\"Bosmer%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;Wood Elf&lt;/a&gt; infant! And these same peasants long comforted themselves with the belief that if they ever had the grave misfortune of facing a lich, they would need only find the vessel containing his spirit form and then destroy it, thus destroying the lich himself. Fools and their folklore! True liches possess no such weakness! Can one of the Sovereign's Worm Eremites be bested by shattering a glass vase? The very notion is so absurd as to be comical. Yes, a Necromancer must transfer his soul into a physical vessel, but once that transference is complete, once the Necromancer has fully metamorphosed into his lich form, the vessel is inconsequential. But it's the process of this transference itself that has eluded me for so long. My soul remains bound to my earthly body, and nothing I have attempted has allowed me to free myself of this mortal coil and transcend to the state of lichdom I so dearly desire.\nEntry 3:.\nEvery tome I've acquired, the volumes upon volumes of &lt;a href=\"Necromantic\"&gt;Necromantic&lt;/a&gt; discourse, all useless! I have grown disgusted by the years of wasted life that have been poured into these so-called \"essential\" writings. Who in their right mind would ever wish to animate a month-dead &lt;a href=\"Cyrodiil\"&gt;Cyrodilic&lt;/a&gt; butterfly, or bring life to the rotting husk of a rare albino mud crab? How many months have I wasted away in this cave? And for what reason? Ah, yes, I know! I will resurrect an army of deformed goblin younglings and march on the &lt;a href=\"White-Gold%20Tower\"&gt;White-Gold Tower&lt;/a&gt; itself! That at least is in my reach! My mind has become a cesspool of Necromantic waste, where reject spells and rituals compete for the honor of finally driving me completely insane. And still I am no closer to achieving my goal than I was when I first began this process. Am I losing faith in myself, in my discipline? Perhaps I have been studying too hard. Many a night I have sacrificed my prayers to our Sovereign for one more experiment, one more incantation. What I need now is rest. Rest, and a state of tranquility, so that I may commune with our Sovereign and re-pledge my loyalty and devotion. For what answer will I find in some crumbling codex that could not be supplied by our great Sovereign himself?\nEntry 4:.\nThe secret is mine! So long I searched, so hard I toiled, but I was a fool! I was right to forgo my studies for a more ardent devotion to prayer. Last night, as I sit in the throes of meditation, our great Sovereign did come to me! He passed to me the knowledge I have sought for so long! The secrets of transcendence were even more complex and arcane than even I could have imagined, and I will never transcribe them into any written work. Indeed, they have never been recorded! All my months of solitude were for naught, as the secret I so desperately sought could only be obtained through direct communication with our great Sovereign himself. Soon I will walk the earth as a Worm Eremite, serving the Sovereign in a state of endless undeath!\nEntry 5:.\nThrough the sacrifice of many innocents, the resurrection of many servants to aid me in my tasks, and the tireless performance of a nearly week-long ritual, I have completed construction of the &lt;a href=\"Sands%20of%20Resolve\"&gt;Sands Of Resolve&lt;/a&gt;. The transcendence to full lichdom will not be immediate, however. The vessel has been crafted, but my energy force, my soul, must be fully transferred into it. Not even our Sovereign was quite certain how long this process would take, as it varies from one Necromancer to the next, based on many factors both physical and spiritual. One thing, however, is certain. This hourglass must never leave my possession until the transference is complete! I grow more powerful every day, but in truth am more vulnerable than I've ever been. If something were to happen to the Sands of Resolve, if the hourglass should somehow leave my person, the connection between soul and vessel would be severed. To think that my work, my life, could be eradicated so easily after I've come so close to success is almost more than I can bear."}

She will consult with her ancestors in her dreams, requesting that the Nerevarine return after the moon has come and gone.\u00a0\nThe next day, after conversing with her ancestors, Nibani now believes that the Hero is the reincarnated Nerevarine, and tasks them to fulfill the Seven Trials (two of which have already been completed). She then advises to seek the counsel of Ashkhan &lt;a href=\"Sul-Matuul\"&gt;Sul-Matuul&lt;/a&gt;.\nKogoruhn.\nAfter speaking with Sul-Matuul, the Nerevarine is sent on a task to prove themselves a warrior. The task requires of the Hero to obtain three items from the &lt;a href=\"House%20Dagoth\"&gt;Sixth House&lt;/a&gt; stronghold &lt;a href=\"Kogoruhn\"&gt;Kogoruhn&lt;/a&gt;: a &lt;a href=\"Corprus%20Weepings\"&gt;Corprus Weepings&lt;/a&gt;, a &lt;a href=\"House%20Dagoth%20Cup\"&gt;House Dagoth cup&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Shadow%20Shield\"&gt;Shadow Shield&lt;/a&gt;. This test will fulfill the Second Trial, which states that the Nerevarine is immune to &lt;a href=\"Corprus\"&gt;Corprus&lt;/a&gt; and all other &lt;a href=\"Diseases%20%28Morrowind%29\"&gt;Diseases&lt;/a&gt;.\nKogoruhn itself can be found to the southeast of the Camp. The stronghold has many areas, but only four are accessible from the exterior, two of which contain the Dagoth cup, and the Weepings. However, the Shadow Shield lies deep within the underground tunnels of Kogoruhn.\nThe Corprus Weepings and the House Dagoth cup can easily be found in the &lt;a href=\"Dome%20of%20Pollock%27s%20Eve\"&gt;Dome of Pollock's Eve&lt;/a&gt;. The Shield is located in the &lt;a href=\"Bleeding%20Heart\"&gt;Bleeding Heart&lt;/a&gt; caverns, under Kogoruhn. The whole area is guarded by many &lt;a href=\"Dagoths\"&gt;Dagoths&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Ash%20Creatures\"&gt;Ash Creatures&lt;/a&gt;. After retrieving the shield, the Nerevarine must return to Sul-Matuul to complete the task.\nThe Third Trial.\nSul-Matuul is surprised by the Nerevarine's return, although, true to his word, he informs the Nerevarine of the Third Trial. The Third Vision, which corresponds to the Third Trial, states that \"In caverns dark Azura's eye sees/and makes to shine like the moon and star\". Sul-Matuul explains that the Nerevarine must travel to the &lt;a href=\"Cavern%20of%20the%20Incarnate%20%28Morrowind%29\"&gt;Cavern of the Incarnate&lt;/a&gt; to speak with the &lt;a href=\"Daedric%20Princes\"&gt;Daedric Prince&lt;/a&gt;\u00a0&lt;a href=\"Azura\"&gt;Azura&lt;/a&gt;, although he does not reveal the location of the cave.\nThe Nerevarine must first solve the riddle to find the location of the hidden Cavern. This can be done by speaking with various members of the &lt;a href=\"Ashlanders%20%28Morrowind%29\"&gt;Ashlanders&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;a href=\"Urshilaku%20Camp\"&gt;Urshilaku Camp&lt;/a&gt;. Once the riddle has been solved the Nerevarine will journey to the Cavern.\nCavern of the Incarnate.\nThe Cavern of the Incarnate can be found by first traveling to &lt;a href=\"Falasmaryon\"&gt;Falasmaryon&lt;/a&gt;, before\u00a0heading towards the &lt;a href=\"Daedric%20Shrines%20%28Morrowind%29\"&gt;Daedric shrine&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"Zergonipal%20%28Morrowind%29\"&gt;Zergonipal&lt;/a&gt;. Near the Daedric shrine, to the south, a path that leads through a &lt;a href=\"Valley%20of%20the%20Wind%20%28Morrowind%29\"&gt;Valley&lt;/a&gt; can be found. The entrance is marked by two large pointed rocks on each side of the valley. These rocks are known as &lt;a href=\"Airan%27s%20Teeth\"&gt;Airan's Teeth&lt;/a&gt;, which are referred to, in the riddle, as the \"teeth of the wind.\" The Nerevarine must proceed down that valley, which winds around at the end. The final parts of the riddle refer to the enchantment that hides the Cavern's entrance, which only opens at dawn (6\u20138 AM) or dusk (6\u20138 PM), when Azura's star is visible in the sky.\nUpon entering the Cavern, the Nerevarine will pick up the &lt;a href=\"Moon-and-Star\"&gt;Moon-and-Star&lt;/a&gt; from the hands of Azura's statue. This causes visions as the voice of Azura is heard:\nThus, the Nerevarine, with Azura's blessing, must now be declared as the &lt;a href=\"Hortator\"&gt;Hortator&lt;/a&gt; of each of the Three Great Houses of &lt;a href=\"Vvardenfell%20%28Morrowind%29\"&gt;Vvardenfell&lt;/a&gt; and the Nerevarine of the four Ashlander Tribes. After the visions, the former Nerevarine's ghosts will appear, and each of them will offer gifts to the Hero, if they are spoken to.\nThe Nerevarine will then, return to Sul-Matuul and Nibani Maesa, in the Urshilaku Camp, to inform them of Azura's task. Nibani will provide further guidance to the Hero.\nCompleting this quest begins the Persecution of the Nerevarine and &lt;a href=\"Public%20Notice%20%28Morrowind%29\"&gt;Public Notices&lt;/a&gt; will start to appear in various places.\nRewards.\n\"(Optional)\" Gifts from the former Nerevarines:"}

The chapel is in an upheaval, but unlike Anvil's chapel, not all of the attendants are dead yet.

Though she was quite a beauty and admired by many, her family had always been poor. And so she worked as a serving maid.\nVirenire: Dearest me, how I long to be out of these rags.\nNarrator: Virenire cleaned diligently and was often praised by her mistress Teryldil, but still she dreamed of a grand life full of wonder. When she heard of a coming ball in the &lt;a href=\"Alinor%20Royal%20Palace\"&gt;Royal Palace&lt;/a&gt;, she knew she had to attend.\nVirenire: Oh, a royal ball! I just know the prince will be there! But how can I go in such a dress?\nNarrator: Virenire was determined. She saved and pleaded and begged, and finally was able to afford a beautiful dress. She even convinced her wealthy mistress to bring her along as an attendant.\nTeryldil: Oh, you've been so diligent for so long. How could I possibly say no?\nNarrator: But still, Teryldil was a smart mistress, and gave her servant a warning.\nTeryldil: Now, you may come to this ball, but always remember your place Verenire. No matter how beautiful you are or how well you dress, you shall always be a servant.\nNarrator: This made Virenire very sad, for she had hoped to catch the eye of a wealthy noble. But still she stayed silent, as a good servant should. The very next night mistress and servant attended the ball.\nVirenire: What wondrous clothes! What delicious food! Why, if only every day was filled with such elegance, I shall be the happiest mer is Summerset.\nNarrator: So great was Virenire's beauty, she caught the eye of the young prince. Forgetting all decorum, he went over to her and asked for a dance. And so the prince and the servant girl danced for a good portion of the night.\nPrince: I've never seen such a beautiful mer. Tell me, who are your parents?\nVirenire: Oh, dear prince, I feel I must be honest. My parents are poor peasants, and I but a serving girl to a wealthy mistress.\nNarrator: Gazing upon the beautiful eyes of such an entrancing mer, the good Prince came to a startling realization.\nPrince: Why, I've been tricked! Here I thought you were a noble mer of good standing, who I might court and one day wed. But you are a mere servant girl.\nNarrator: And though the words stung her heart, Virenire knew them to be true. For only a noble mer would be able to marry someone such as a prince. So Virenire resolved to find herself a suitable husband within her caste. The prince, of course, married a Kinlady of suitable reputation and never spoke to the servant girl again. And so we should all remember, no matter our looks or possessions, we shall always be beholden to our family's name."}

A perfect host is the anchor for any event, the smiling face that makes everyone welcome, the entertaining and accommodating party-thrower who makes sure every guest is wined and dined and has a good time.\nBut a perfect host isn't born knowing how to bestow a rousing good time upon a crowd of guests, or how to set up a memorable event. To be a perfect host requires years of training, days of strategic planning, and hours of preparation and set up.\nOr, you can follow these few easy steps based on my own extensive experience and years of successful event planning.\nFirst, select a theme for your party or event. A good theme provides context for your gathering and gives your guests a fun and exciting motif to focus upon. Theme examples include classic &lt;a href=\"Dunmer%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Dunmeri&lt;/a&gt; plays, spring or fall harvest, &lt;a href=\"Nord\"&gt;Nord&lt;/a&gt; drinking games, and (my personal favorite) Grim Brooding Day.\nSecond, choose your guests. How large an event do you want to host? Select a number you can comfortably squeeze into your venue\u2014and depending on your theme, the tighter the squeeze the better\u2014and remember to invite twice that number to account for declines and no-shows.\nAfter you have selected a number and chosen the people you want to invite, prepare your invitations. The quality of the invitation reflects on the event you plan to hold, so match the paper and message to your theme as best you can. Then send the invitations at most one month prior to but no later than one week before the event.\nThird, use your theme to determine if your event will be an occasion to sit down and relax or stand and mingle. If tables and chairs fit your theme, plan your seating arrangements carefully and provide seating cards to tell your guests where to sit. I cannot stress how important a good seating chart is. You have the power to create interesting conversations, intriguing arguments, or meaningful connections\u2014all according to whom you sit next to who.\nFourth, develop a menu. Every event demands food and drink. But your theme and venue allow a broad interpretation of what that means. Do you want to host a formal dinner? Provide snacks and lighter fare? Feature the best wine that &lt;a href=\"Septim%20%28Coin%29\"&gt;gold&lt;/a&gt; can buy? Or perhaps you simply want to have vast amounts of the cheapest intoxicants available in order to get all of your guests happily hammered? As long as it fits your theme and your budget, this is all up to you.\nFifth, entertain your guests! The first four steps will go a long way toward creating a fun and memorable event. However, to put the icing on the cake, you need to provide some killer entertainment. Minstrels and bards are perfect for themes that include singing and dancing. Poets and storytellers are best suited to performance-based events where you intend your guests to be an audience instead of participants in the event. Prestidigitators, animal trainers, weapon masters, actors, and more are also obvious choices for an evening's entertainment. Just match your theme and go wild, and your guests will love it!\nGood luck! You are now on your way to becoming the perfect host!"}

Indeed, Azura requires that the Agent \"murder a priest\" on her behalf, simply for being \"rude\" about the Prince.\nHurting a Healer.\nUpon accepting the quest, Azura will reveal that the \"perfectly awful priest\" is a \"Healer,\" who is currently \"cleansing\" a dungeon nearby.

To get their reward the Agent will have to speak with an apostle of Azura, located in a library in another town, but only after the healer lies dead.\nWith that the Agent should head to dungeon and track down the healer, who will be found in the form of a &lt;a href=\"Monk%20%28Daggerfall%29\"&gt;monk&lt;/a&gt;. There may be multiple monks roaming the halls of the dungeon, so the Agent will have to keep killing until they receive the following notification:\n\"You have killed the Healer, as you promised Azura.\"\nThe Agent must now escape the dungeon and head to the town mentioned by Azura. Once there, the Agent will find the Prince's apostle in the town's \"library,\" a fact revealed when asking one of the local inhabitants. Speaking with the apostle before the time limit expires will successfully complete the quest.\nRewards.\nCompleting the quest successfully within the time limit will see the Agent rewarded with Azura's Star by the Prince's apostle. The Agent will also receive a boost in reputation with the faction whom summoned the Prince for them, as well as the faction's associates.

At each site the pilgrim must stand before the three-sided stone triolith and read the inscription. To ease the pilgrim's task, the Temple has made this list of shrines along with directions and advice to pilgrims. The blessings of each shrine last at least a half day.\nThe Fields of Kummu: Shrine of Humility.\nHere Lord &lt;a href=\"Vivec\"&gt;Vivec&lt;/a&gt; met a poor farmer whose guar had died. The farmer could not harvest his muck without his guar, and he could not provide for his family or his village. So the Lord Vivec removed his fine clothes and toiled in the fields like a beast of burden until the crop was harvested. It is at the &lt;a href=\"Fields%20of%20Kummu%20%28Morrowind%20Location%29\"&gt;Fields of Kummu&lt;/a&gt; we go to pray for the same humility Lord Vivec showed on that day.\nThe Fields of Kummu are west of &lt;a href=\"Suran%20%28Morrowind%29\"&gt;Suran&lt;/a&gt; on the north shore of Lake Amaya as you head towards &lt;a href=\"Pelagiad\"&gt;Pelagiad&lt;/a&gt;. The shrine is between two rocks, and most easily noticed while traveling east along the road. Alof's farm nearby has a small dock on the north bank of Lake Amaya. This is the only dock nearby which Alof kindly allows servants of the &lt;a href=\"Tribunal%20Temple\"&gt;Temple&lt;/a&gt; to use. It is customary to leave a portion of muck at the shrine to represent Vivec's humility.\nTo Stop the Moon: The Shrine of Daring.\nWhen &lt;a href=\"Sheogorath\"&gt;Sheogorath&lt;/a&gt; rebelled against the &lt;a href=\"Tribunal\"&gt;Tribunal&lt;/a&gt;, he tricked the moon &lt;a href=\"Baar%20Dau\"&gt;Baar Dau&lt;/a&gt; into forsaking its appointed path through &lt;a href=\"Oblivion%20%28Realm%29\"&gt;Oblivion&lt;/a&gt;. The Mad Star inspired the moon to hurl itself upon Vivec's new &lt;a href=\"Vivec%20City%20%28Morrowind%29\"&gt;city&lt;/a&gt;, which Sheogorath claimed was built in mockery of the heavens. When Vivec learned of Sheogorath's scheme, he froze the rogue moon in the sky with a single gesture and the grace of his countenance. Overwhelmed by the courage and daring of Vivec, the moon Baar Dau swore itself to eternal service of the Tribunal and all its works. Thus the moon now stands guard over the palace, and serves as a &lt;a href=\"Ministry%20of%20Truth%20%28Morrowind%29\"&gt;citadel&lt;/a&gt; for the Temple's &lt;a href=\"Ordinator%20%28Morrowind%29\"&gt;Ordinators&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe Shrine of Daring is found in the city of Vivec, in the &lt;a href=\"Vivec%2C%20Temple%20Canton\"&gt;Temple District&lt;/a&gt;, along the western wall of the &lt;a href=\"High%20Fane\"&gt;High Fane&lt;/a&gt;, the great Temple of &lt;a href=\"Vvardenfell%20%28Morrowind%29\"&gt;Vvardenfell&lt;/a&gt;. When you address the shrine, it is customary to leave behind a Potion of Rising Force. Suitable potions may be purchased from the Temple. Homemade potions are not acceptable.\nThe Palace: Shrine of Generosity.\nLong after &lt;a href=\"Lord%20Nerevar\"&gt;Lord Nerevar&lt;/a&gt; and the Tribunal triumphed over &lt;a href=\"Dagoth%20Ur%20%28Character%29\"&gt;Dagoth Ur&lt;/a&gt;, the people wished to build a monument to the heroes of that war. Vivec thanked them, but said that it would be better to dedicate a monument not only to the glorious heroes, but to all people, great and small, who suffered and died in the war. It became the custom to make offerings here, either in thanks of our good fortune, or for those less fortunate.\nThe Shrine of Generosity is on the top steps of Vivec's Palace, the southernmost Canton of Vivec City. The customary donation for those in good fortune is 100 gold.\nThe Puzzle Canal: The Shrine of Courtesy.\nIn a battle with &lt;a href=\"Mehrunes%20Dagon\"&gt;Mehrunes Dagon&lt;/a&gt;, Vivec gave his own silver longsword to the &lt;a href=\"Daedric%20Princes\"&gt;Daedra Lord&lt;/a&gt; rather than dishonor himself by fighting an unarmed foe. This so impressed the &lt;a href=\"Dremora%20%28Morrowind%29\"&gt;Dremora&lt;/a&gt;, the most honorable and chivalrous of Mehrunes Dagon's &lt;a href=\"Daedric\"&gt;Daedric&lt;/a&gt; servants, that they now share a bond of respect and courtesy with the followers of the Tribunal, though we must never forget that they are our enemies.\nThe Shrine of Courtesy is found in the heart of the Puzzle Canal, a labyrinth beneath Lord Vivec's Palace in the city of Vivec. The journey though the Puzzle Canal can be confusing and it is suggested that common pilgrims carry a scroll of ALMSIVI Intervention in case they get lost. The Dremora Krazzt is found in the center of the Puzzle Canal, and will accept a plain silver longsword if spoken to with courtesy. After Krazzt accepts the sword, pilgrims must read the inscription on the triolith.\nThe Mask of Vivec: Shrine of Justice.\nNear the altar is Vivec's Ash Mask. In the Days of Fire when Dagoth Ur first crept back into &lt;a href=\"Red%20Mountain\"&gt;Red Mountain&lt;/a&gt; and awakened it, Vivec led refugees here as they fled the ash and blight. Weary, they rested here a while. When Vivec awoke, he found himself and all his followers encased in casts of grey ash. Frozen like a sleeping statue and unable to free himself or help his people, Vivec was filled with despair. Vivec's tears weakened his ash cast. He tore the ash from his perished followers, breathed life into their lungs, and cured them of the blight. This is Vivec's heroism -- his tender heart provides strength when his might fails.\nThe Shrine of Justice is guarded within the &lt;a href=\"Gnisis%20Temple%20%28Morrowind%29\"&gt;Gnisis Temple&lt;/a&gt;, in the village of &lt;a href=\"Gnisis%20%28Morrowind%29\"&gt;Gnisis&lt;/a&gt;, northwest by road from the town of &lt;a href=\"Ald%27ruhn\"&gt;Ald'ruhn&lt;/a&gt;. When you address the shrine, it is customary to leave a potion of Cure Common Disease as a token of your respect for justice. Suitable potions may be purchased from Temple. Homemade potions are not acceptable.\nKoal Cave: The Shrine of Valor.\nWithin the &lt;a href=\"Koal%20Cave\"&gt;Koal Cave&lt;/a&gt;, Vivec fought a battle with Ruddy Man, the father of the &lt;a href=\"Dreugh%20%28Morrowind%29\"&gt;Dreugh&lt;/a&gt;. When he defeated Ruddy Man, Vivec spared his life, on the condition that Ruddy Man and his children would give up their tough hides to serve as armor for the &lt;a href=\"Dunmer%20%28Morrowind%29\"&gt;Dunmer&lt;/a&gt;.\n&lt;a href=\"The%20Shrine%20of%20Valor\"&gt;The Shrine of Valor&lt;/a&gt; is inside the Koal Cave, a cavern on the seacoast west of the ancient stronghold &lt;a href=\"Berandas\"&gt;Berandas&lt;/a&gt; and south of Gnisis. The cave mouth faces south, towards the sea, and is marked by a large natural arch of stone. The region is wilderness, and finding the cave mouth can be difficult. Dreugh within the cave itself are fearsome enemies; only experienced and capable adventurers should attempt to re-enact the epic battle with the dreugh in the cave. Dreugh wax may be bought at the Temple in Gnisis. When you address the shrine, it is customary to leave a portion of dreugh wax as a token of Vivec's victorious struggle with Ruddy Man.\nThe Ghostfence: The Shrine of Pride.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Ghostfence\"&gt;Ghostfence&lt;/a&gt; is a lasting symbol of the indomitable will and power of ALMSIVI, and a monument to Dunmer pride in overcoming its enemies.\nThe Shrine of Pride is found within the Ghostfence, just northeast of the Ghostgate itself. The safest route to Ghostgate is along the &lt;a href=\"Foyada%20Mamaea\"&gt;Foyada Mamaea&lt;/a&gt;, a volcanic ravine running from the top of Red Mountain southwest to its end just below &lt;a href=\"Balmora%20%28Morrowind%29\"&gt;Balmora&lt;/a&gt;. An old &lt;a href=\"Dwemer\"&gt;Dwemer&lt;/a&gt; bridge crosses the &lt;a href=\"foyada\"&gt;foyada&lt;/a&gt; near &lt;a href=\"Fort%20Moonmoth\"&gt;Fort Moonmoth&lt;/a&gt;. A pilgrim may follow the Foyada Mamaea all the way to Ghostgate. Any journey inside the Ghostfence is dangerous, but even the most timid pilgrim should be safe, so long as he does not stray too far from the Ghostgate and flees from any minions of &lt;a href=\"Dagoth%20Ur%20%28Character%29\"&gt;Dagoth Ur&lt;/a&gt;. When you address the shrine, it is customary to leave a soul gem in remembrance of our ancestors who were bound to the Tribunal's service."}

A scout by the name of &lt;a href=\"Nilioniel\"&gt;Nilioniel&lt;/a&gt; provides &lt;a href=\"Trainers%20%28Morrowind%29\"&gt;skill training&lt;/a&gt;, and despite the owner's negligence a free &lt;a href=\"Rest%23Morrowind\"&gt;bed&lt;/a&gt; is available in one of the rooms. Otherwise there is little reason to visit the inn. There are no quests that lead the &lt;a href=\"Nerevarine\"&gt;Nerevarine&lt;/a&gt; to this location, and nothing of interest here.\nDescription.\nA short hallway leads from the entry to the main area of the inn. Two traders, &lt;a href=\"Dunel%20Saryon\"&gt;Dunel Saryon&lt;/a&gt; and Selkirnemus will purchase ingredients, but only the latter has (a very small quantity of) ingredients for sale.

A bard by the name of &lt;a href=\"Ales%20Julalanie\"&gt;Ales Julalanie&lt;/a&gt; is in the northern bedroom. She has 16 on the table in the corner. The southern bedroom is identical to Ales' room.

They found nothing.\nThen, one night, the incessant music cut through the air more loudly than ever. The townsfolk dreamed that night, of critters and vermin, and struggled to sleep.

If you lose, well, you'll know the freedom of &lt;a href=\"Sovngarde%20%28Location%29\"&gt;Sovngarde&lt;/a&gt; if you're lucky.\"\"\nUsage.\nThe Pit was intended to be used as a way to get out of prison in Windhelm, but it was not included in the final release of the game, and thus cannot be accessed through normal means. To successfully be released from prison in Windhelm, it seems that one would have had to defeat another Prisoner in a duel. They could later return to take part in a series of duels, one of which may have been against &lt;a href=\"Alain%20Dufont\"&gt;Alain Dufont&lt;/a&gt;, depending on how far one was in the quest \"&lt;a href=\"Mourning%20Never%20Comes\"&gt;Mourning Never Comes&lt;/a&gt;\" at the time of incarceration.\nInteractions.\nThere is little to actually interact with, but by typing codice_2 in the console and going to the arena, one can see that there are cage doors where prisoners would apparently have been released from. Twelve Pit Fans stand around the arena, but they have no unique dialogue. There are doors leading out of the area, and although they can be partially opened, they cannot be stepped through as they were intended to have led to other cells.\nInhabitants.\nMost of the fighters in the Pit have been fighting there for years, and are quite adept at the skill. Those who manage the Pit are not all completely law-abiding; one of those people, &lt;a href=\"Benkum%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Benkum&lt;/a&gt;, is notably corrupt, even taking bribes from fighters. The following is a list of characters that can be found in the Pit:"}

It is here in which the lowest orders of Oblivion are guarded. With a few exceptions, the realm is usually unreachable via mortal devices, and due to the lack of accessibility the majority of information regarding this realm is derived from the reports of other Princes.\nDuring the &lt;a href=\"Oblivion%20Crisis\"&gt;Oblivion Crisis&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;a href=\"3E%20433\"&gt;433rd year&lt;/a&gt; of the &lt;a href=\"Third%20Era\"&gt;Third Era&lt;/a&gt;, five of Peryite's worshipers performed a ritual at his hidden shrine in an attempt to summon the Daedric Prince.

Peryite later tasked the &lt;a href=\"Hero%20of%20Kvatch\"&gt;Hero of Kvatch&lt;/a&gt; with recovering the souls of the five worshippers.

The creators and times of the rituals are long forgotten. But followed properly, the rite brings great power and prestige to the Huntsman.\nThe ritual pits the all-powerful Huntsman and their Greater and Lesser Dogs against the pitiful and doomed Innocent Quarry, called by tradition the Hare, after the mortal creature of human hunts. At once, the Huntsman is transported by the exquisite thrill and glory of his might and dominion over his helpless prey, and at the same time touched by the tragic, noble, and ultimately futile plight of the Innocent Quarry. In the highest aesthetic realization of the ritual, the ecstatic rapture of the kill is balanced by the Huntsman's identification with the sadness and despair of the Innocent Quarry. As in pieces the body of the innocent Hare is torn, the Huntsman reflects on the tragic imbalances of power and the cruel injustices of the world.\nAs the Hunt begins, the Lesser Dogs assemble before the green crystal reflections of the Chapel of the Innocent Quarry. Inside the Chapel, the Huntsman, the Greater Dogs, and the Master of the Hunt perform the rites that initiate and sanctify the Huntsman, the Hunt, and the Innocent Quarry. Then the Huntsman emerges from the Chapel, displays the &lt;a href=\"Spear%20of%20Bitter%20Mercy\"&gt;Spear of Bitter Mercy&lt;/a&gt;, and recites the Offices of the Hunt. The Offices describe explains (sic) the laws and conditions of the four stages of the Hunt: the Drag, the Chase, the Call, and the View to the Kill.\nStage One- The Drag, in which the Lesser Dogs drag the ground to flush out the Hare.\nStage Two- The Chase, in which the Greater Hounds drive the Hare before them.\nStage Three- The Call, in which the Greater Hounds trap the Hare and summon the Huntsman for the kill.\nStage Four- The View, in which the Huntsman makes the kill with the ritual Spear of Bitter Mercy, and calls upon the Master of the Hunt to view the kill by ringing the town bell. The Master of the Hunt then bestows the Bounty upon the Huntsman Bold who has wielded the Spear of Bitter Mercy in the Kill. The Master of the Hunt also calls upon the Huntsman Bold to name the next Hare for the next Hunt (though the Huntsman Bold himself may not participate in the next Hunt).\nThe Offices of the Hunt, which the Huntsman, Master, and Hounds are solemnly sworn to honor, detail the practices and conditions of the Hunt. These practices and conditions, also known as the Law, strictly define all details of the Hunt, such as how many Hounds of each sort may participate, how the Spear of Bitter Mercy may be wielded, and so forth. In addition, the Law states that the Hare must have a genuine chance to escape the Hunt, no matter how slim.\nIn practice, this condition has been defined as the availability of six keys, which, if gathered together in the &lt;a href=\"Temple%20of%20Daedric%20Rites\"&gt;Temple of Daedric Rites&lt;/a&gt;, permit the Hare to teleport away from the Hunt, and so elude the Huntsman and his Spear. It is inconceivable, of course, that the Hare might actually discover the keys and escape, but the forms must be observed, and tampering with the keys or cheating the Hare of a genuine chance of finding or using the keys is a shameful and unforgivable betrayal of the Law of the Hunt.\nThe Ritual of the Hunt grants the Huntsman protection from all forms of attack, including mortal and immortal weapons, and sorceries of all schools. Huntsman are cautioned, however, that the ritual does not protect the Huntsman from the potent energies of his own Spear, and cautions against reckless wielding of the Spear in close melee, darkness, or other dangerous circumstances, for a single touch of the Spear of Bitter Mercy means instant and certain death for innocent Hare or fellow Huntsman alike.\nThe right to name a Wild Hunt is a grand and grave right indeed, as all but the High &lt;a href=\"Daedra%20Lords\"&gt;Daedra Lords&lt;/a&gt; are vulnerable to the potent sorceries of the Spear of Bitter Mercy. The Spear itself is therefore a terrible weapon, and it is forbidden to remove it from the Grounds of the Ritual Hunt."}

Unfortunately, in those troubled days, kidnappings, murders, and thievery were rampant, and there was a dearth of able-bodied adventurers for such assignments. In fact, the only person who answered her call was a skinny, little fellow named Baranat.\n\u201cYou are certainly brave, but I fear you would never survive,\u201d said the old woman. \u201cMy daughter, you see, has been kidnapped by the Coribael brothers whose physical prowess is the stuff of legend.\u201d\n\u201cMy lady,\u201d said Baranat. \u201cWhen I was born, I was blessed by &lt;a href=\"Vivec\"&gt;Vivec&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Almalexia\"&gt;Almalexia&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Sotha%20Sil\"&gt;Sotha Sil&lt;/a&gt;, and I have the ear of the saints. If I run into any trouble, I'll call on them to aid my quest.\u201d\nDoubtful, but having no other prospects, the old woman sent Baranat off, explaining that the four brothers' camp was to the north. In the center of the camp, the eldest and most powerful brother Airen Coribael was holding Lady Genevrah personally. Each of his brothers guarded a different post along the valley -- Baranat would have to defeat each to rescue the lady.\nBaranat rode many miles through the northern swamps before he came to the first of the brothers' guard posts. There he saw Vanis Coribael, the youngest of the brothers, watching the valley for intruders. Vanis was known to be &lt;a href=\"Speed%20%28Morrowind%29\"&gt;faster&lt;/a&gt; than the wind, a warrior who could thrash his opponents before they even unsheathed their weapons. Baranat took a look at his sad, cut-rate iron blade, and prayed to the saints.\nSaint &lt;a href=\"Veloth\"&gt;Veloth&lt;/a&gt; the Pilgrim appeared before Baranat in shining robes, and smiled upon him, \u201cBaranat, put down your blade and I will make you swifter than bolt of lightning.\u201d\nBaranat dropped his blade and ran at Vanis, moving so fast he didn't rustle a leaf with his pace. In a flash, Vanis was dead by Baranat's hands. The adventurer continued on until he reached the second youngest Coribael brother, Feryn, who not only was as fast as Vanis, but so &lt;a href=\"Strength%20%28Morrowind%29\"&gt;strong&lt;/a&gt;, he could rip a &lt;a href=\"trama\"&gt;trama&lt;/a&gt; shrub up by the roots with two fingers. Baranat hid himself and trembled as he looked at the giant Feryn Coribael. Again, the young adventurer prayed to the saints.\n&lt;a href=\"Indoril%20Nerevar\"&gt;Saint Nerevar the Captain&lt;/a&gt; appeared before Baranat in golden armor, and smiled upon him, \u201cBaranat, I will make you stronger than a hundred warriors.\u201d\nBaranat rushed at Feryn, knocking the giant through a boulder which turned to dust on impact. Feryn tried to get to his feet, but Baranat tore him apart, scattering him across the valley floor in eighty-seven pieces. Beyond Feryn's post was a raging river, where the second eldest Coribael brother, Horis, stood guard. Horis, who was faster than his brother Vanis, stronger than his brother Feryn, and so tough that he could swim in the lava of &lt;a href=\"Dagoth%20Ur%20%28Character%29\"&gt;Dagoth Ur&lt;/a&gt; like it was the &lt;a href=\"Padomaic%20Ocean\"&gt;Padomaic Ocean&lt;/a&gt;. Baranat thought of his own tolerance for pain, which was minimal, and prayed to the saints for help.\n&lt;a href=\"Roris\"&gt;Saint Roris the Martyr&lt;/a&gt; appeared before Baranat with flesh like sparkling gems, and smiled on him, \u201cBaranat, I will make you unyielding as the heart of &lt;a href=\"Oblivion%20%28Realm%29\"&gt;Oblivion&lt;/a&gt;.\u201d\nBaranat rushed at Horis, and two plunged into the rushing river. For twelve hours, they wrestled one another under the water, until Horis could hold his breath no more and drowned. Baranat pulled himself out of the river and continued down the valley, until he reached the camp. Airen Coribael himself was there, guarding a squirming sack which Baranat assumed either contained Lady Genevrah or several large cats. The young adventurer quailed at the prospect of doing battle with Airen Coribael, the swiftest, strongest, sturdiest, and most accomplished fighter of the brothers. He prayed to the saints for help.\n&lt;a href=\"Olms\"&gt;Saint Olms the Just&lt;/a&gt; appeared before Baranat in a burst of flame, and smiled on him, \u201cBaranat, I will make you more cunning in battle than the most dangerous of &lt;a href=\"Daedra\"&gt;daedra&lt;/a&gt;.\u201d\nBaranat walked calmly into the camp and began battle with Airen Coribael. The fight lasted seven days, and for six of them, Airen had the upper hand. He rained kicks and punches down using the arrhythmic style the &lt;a href=\"Khajiit%20%28Morrowind%29\"&gt;Khajiit&lt;/a&gt; call Goutfang; he parried and blocked in all the fashions of the great &lt;a href=\"Nords%20%28Morrowind%29\"&gt;Nordic&lt;/a&gt; warriors; he maintained his balance, coordination, speed, strength, timing, and tactics as the moons rose and fell from the sky. But on the seventh day, as he was preparing his Killing Blow, he suddenly stopped, eyes wide open. The blood drained from his face, and he realized the trap he had stepped into. A trap with no escape. With three quick flashes of his hand, Baranat completed the Cycle of Blood, the old &lt;a href=\"Redguards%20%28Morrowind%29\"&gt;Redguard&lt;/a&gt; fighting style he had begun on day one. Airen Coribael breathed no more.\nThe young adventurer ran to open the sack where Lady Genevrah lay. His first surprise. She had a face like a &lt;a href=\"Dreugh%20%28Morrowind%29\"&gt;dreugh&lt;/a&gt; and as she began to berate him for taking his time, he realized that she had a very, very, very unpleasant personality as well. Several days later, when they were back at the old woman's court, he discovered that the estate that he would be inheriting was utterly dissolute by decades of blight storms and poor crops.\n&lt;a href=\"Delyn\"&gt;Saint Delyn the Wise&lt;/a&gt; watched the young adventurer from a cloud in the sky, and smiled on him, \u201cBaranat, before you fight, find out what you're fighting for.\u201d"}

On the &lt;a href=\"Calendar%20%28Daggerfall%29\"&gt;2nd of Sun's Dusk&lt;/a&gt; the Prince of Deceit Boethiah may be summoned, if the Agent agrees to pay a summoner of either a &lt;a href=\"Witch%20Coven\"&gt;Witch Coven&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Mages%20Guild%20%28Daggerfall%29\"&gt;Mages Guild&lt;/a&gt; or a &lt;a href=\"Temples%20%28Daggerfall%29\"&gt;temple&lt;/a&gt;.\nWalkthrough.\nThe Agent may approach a summoner at either the Mages Guild, a Temple, or a Witch Coven to summon one of the Daedric Princes. If the summoning occurs on the 2nd of Sun's Dusk, the Agent may receive a vision of &lt;a href=\"Boethiah%20%28Daggerfall%29\"&gt;Boethiah&lt;/a&gt;, whom immediately offers them a quest. Indeed, Boethiah will ask that the Agent proves their \"mettle\" to use what the Prince promises: The &lt;a href=\"Ebony%20Mail%20%28Daggerfall%29\"&gt;Ebony Mail&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe Charitable Ass.\nUpon accepting the quest, Boethiah reveals that \"a perfectly charming and charitable ass\" has been \"annoying\" them, and must be destroyed. This \"toff\" has their own \"fortress,\" a &lt;a href=\"Dungeons%20%28Daggerfall%29\"&gt;dungeon&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;a href=\"Regions%20%28Daggerfall%29\"&gt;region&lt;/a&gt; that Boethiah was summoned in, into which the Agent must delve. Boethiah also informs the Agent of the name and location of one of the Prince's apostles, whom will hand the Agent their reward should they complete the quest in time.\nA Simple Kill.\nWith that the Agent must head into the dungeon mentioned by Boethiah in search of the \"ass,\" who appears as a &lt;a href=\"Spellsword%20%28Daggerfall%29\"&gt;spellsword&lt;/a&gt;. Speed is of the essence, for if the Agent spends too much time looking for the spellsword, but is within the overall time limit specified by Boethiah, they will instead find a note addressed to the \"toff.\" However, if the spellsword is still there the Agent simply has to kill them, and will be informed by the following notification:\n\"You have kept your part of the bargain with Boethiah -- [Spellsword's name] is dead.\"\nWith the spellsword dead the Agent simply has to escape the dungeon and speak with Boethiah's apostle in the town mentioned by the Prince, before the original time limit expires.\nA Worthless Informant.\nShould the Agent instead find the note addressed to the spellsword, then they will have to meet with the informant, whom resides in a nearby town. The Agent will have to ask around about the informant's name, before finding them in one of the town buildings. Upon being spoken with, the informant will state:\n\"How did you get in here ... [Oath]! I knew [Spellsword's name] would get me killed one day. Listen, since [he/she] doesn't value my life enough not to leave my letter lying around, [he/she] isn't worth protecting any longer. You can find [him/her] in [second dungeon]. I wash my hands of [him/her] at last.\"\nWith that, the Agent must head into the dungeon mentioned by the informant and kill them. Once that has been completed, identified by the same notification as above, the Agent must head to the town mentioned by Boethiah and speak with their apostle before the time limit expires.\nRewards.\nCompleting the quest successfully within the time limit will see the Agent rewarded with the &lt;a href=\"Ebony%20Mail%20%28Daggerfall%29\"&gt;Ebony Mail&lt;/a&gt; by the Prince's apostle. The Agent will also receive a boost in reputation with the faction whom summoned the Prince for them, as well as the faction's associates. Conversely, failing the quest will result in the Agent losing reputation with the summoner's faction.\nThe changes made to reputation, either by successfully completing or failing the quest are shown below:"}

So familiar that their true significance has escaped notice of most, until now. I have recently uncovered the terrible secret hidden in these ruins, and I will now share this secret with you. But be warned - this knowledge may be too much for some, as you will know the awful fate that lies in store for you, but will be powerless to do anything to prevent it. If you are strong enough of mind to withstand the psychic shock of having your grim future laid bare, read on.\nMy interest in the ruins began with a simple observation: all the ruins visible on the surface appear to be of roughly the same age and architectural style. Who created these once-mighty structures, and what happened to them?\nFurther investigation revealed an even stranger truth: although the ruins superficially all appear to derive from the same era, they are in fact of wildly differing ages. Many thousands of years separate the ruins of &lt;a href=\"Cylarne\"&gt;Cylarne&lt;/a&gt; (by far the oldest extant on the surface, despite its relatively well-maintained state) from the ruins of &lt;a href=\"Ebrocca\"&gt;Ebrocca&lt;/a&gt;, which at almost 1,000 years old is one of the youngest sites in the Isles. For those who would dismiss this conclusion, I invite you to visit the ruins and examine the evidence for yourselves: the depth of strata covering the buried portions of the structures; the weathering of the exposed stone; the growth of vegetation on and around the structures; etc. (I have compiled the evidence in a separate monograph, \"Dating the Predecessor Ruins: Shocking New Evidence Comprehensively Explained,\" which is presently unpublished, though I will gladly make it available for those scholars wishing to delve further into the minutiae of this subject.)\nOnce I began to accurately establish the dates of the various ruins, a disturbing pattern emerged. The ruins fell into distinct periods, each period separated by exactly 1,000 years from the other (although Cylarne remains the exception, being many thousands of years older than the next oldest extant ruin - suggesting only that the ruins from many earlier eras lie waiting to be discovered, or have been lost to the ravages of time).\nWhat could account for this process of destruction, repeating itself every 1,000 years without fail? The legend of the &lt;a href=\"Greymarch\"&gt;Greymarch&lt;/a&gt; sprang immediately to mind, that ancient tale of a vengeful god venting his wrath upon the land. What if it were more than a legend? What if it were the dimly-remembered account of a real event?\nI suddenly realized the significance of the dating of the most recent ruin that I had discovered: &lt;a href=\"Ebrocca\"&gt;Ebrocca&lt;/a&gt;, which my tests proved to be about 1,000 years old. Yes, Dear Reader, we come to it at last. The Cataclysm is upon us again. I have dated the ruins of Ebrocca to great accuracy; I know the very year of our Doom. I refrain from publishing the exact date, as this knowledge is a terrible burden that I would not inflict on others.\nFor a long time I hesitated from issuing even this general warning, fearful of inciting panic or despair. But I have concluded that it is better to have time to prepare for the End in whatever way one sees fit than to have it thrust upon them unawares. I no longer doubt that the legend of the Greymarch is based on historical events, and that the last days of our civilization will be terrible - the blasted and tumbled stones of the mighty cities of bygone eras are testament enough to that. But I find it strangely comforting to know that our end is already written in the stones of our Predecessors, and that struggling against our Doom is as pointless as shouting against the incoming tide. I hope that at least a few of my readers will find equal solace in this bleak foreknowledge."}

There are few things more appreciated than carving the bones of a fallen enemy for your sweetheart back home. That, alongside a well cooked hunk of haunch, and you have yourself a romantic little setup right there.\nBut, like most things, the &lt;a href=\"Altmer%20%28Online%29\"&gt;High Elves&lt;/a&gt; take jewelry crafting to an entirely new level. They don't see it as a simple career choice. By &lt;a href=\"Y%27ffre\"&gt;Y'ffre&lt;/a&gt;, they don't even consider it a mere passion. No, it is fate, a calling handed down to them. Feel free to ask one if you want to hear all about it. They would be happy to talk your ear off. Trust me.\nFrom what I can understand, the High Elf art of jewelry crafting is generally passed down through generations. And that really does mean something to the High Elves. Taking on the legacy of their family name is not only expected, it's revered. In that way though, all of them respect each other. Even a &lt;a href=\"kinlord\"&gt;kinlord&lt;/a&gt; will speak highly of a family of fishers, so long as they do their job right. You can't really say that about the rest of &lt;a href=\"Tamriel\"&gt;Tamriel&lt;/a&gt;.\nAnd I have to admit, their jewelry is beautiful. You ain't never seen such well-crafted rings as those on even a common High Elf's fingers. They're downright dainty, intricate, even. Swirls and patterns that seem to intertwine, even on the tiniest scale. There's a kind of complex simplicity there. Wait, does that even make sense?\nI mean to say, jewelry made by the High Elves just seems natural. Like the branches of a tree, or the swirls within a running stream. I don't know how they do it. I suppose that's the trade off of having your skills passed down through such long family lines. These High Elves aren't simply honing their skill throughout a lifetime, no. They're honing a skill throughout generations.\nI'd love to learn a thing or two while I'm visiting &lt;a href=\"Summerset%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Summerset&lt;/a&gt;, but I doubt that will ever happen. Not because I haven't been able to find someone who is willing to talk with me about their craft, oh no. I just haven't found one who won't drone on and on for hours on some technique their great-great-grand uncle came up with hundreds of years ago.\nThat being said, I have yet to have a single &lt;a href=\"mer\"&gt;mer&lt;/a&gt; here ask me about my own techniques. Of course, that's not too surprising. After all, I'm just a muddy little Wood Elf carving up some bone."}

This often surprises people\u2014particularly &lt;a href=\"Men\"&gt;Men&lt;/a&gt;. While they drift through a fog of half-remembered dreams, we &lt;a href=\"Altmer\"&gt;Altmer&lt;/a&gt; remember everything. Every embrace, every slight, every triumph and defeat lurks at the edge of our sight, frozen in time\u2014waiting to be recalled with unnerving accuracy. So now, when I say perfect clarity, you take my meaning.\nI was a wiry youth of eighteen. The chapel smelled of incense and cherry-blossoms, and my entire calan\u2014mother, father, grandseers, and rumes\u2014shuffled in their pews, filled with nervous pride. The Ascendant Curate approached slowly. A stole of swan feathers and dragontongue cascaded over her shoulders, and upon her brow rested a grand welkyn wreath, bedecked in driftwood and precious stones. She stopped just a finger's length away from me and bade me to kneel. I did so, and she held my calian aloft. I saw it glistening in the starlight above and suddenly realized I was crying. At that time, the sphere was pristine\u2014fashioned from milky aethequartz and sun-blown glass. I remember thinking, \"How fragile a thing it is.\" Even then, I knew its great value. After reciting the Athel Vialen, she placed the sphere in my hands and smiled. I cradled it like a songbird just emerged from its egg. In that moment, I swore an oath to protect it. But what does an eighteen year-old know of oaths? Youth often makes a meal of the sacred. Too often.\nI grew into an angry young Mer\u2014disillusioned by the idle pride of my peers and the sneering detachment of my elders. At fifty-two, I joined a crew of privateers. We wreaked havoc on &lt;a href=\"Redguard\"&gt;Redguard&lt;/a&gt; smugglers for thirteen years. As time sailed on, our coffers swelled with foreign treasures. When we parted company, each crewman enjoyed wealth beyond measure.\nIn all my years on the sea, I never lost sight of my calian. It rested beneath my bunk, safely tucked away in a willow-wood box. All the treasures of &lt;a href=\"Hammerfell\"&gt;Hammerfell&lt;/a&gt; fell short of its brilliance. All the pride of my noble race found voice in its creamy luster.\nDetermined to settle down, I sought out a parcel of land east of &lt;a href=\"Alinor\"&gt;Alinor&lt;/a&gt;\u2014a vineyard of modest reputation. I offered a fortune in gold to the aging vintner, but he refused to sell. With each passing day, my offers grew (as did my impatience). Who was this decrepit Mer to stand in the way of my happiness? What right did he have to deprive me of what I desired? At length, I resolved to make this toothless Elf see reason. I rode out to his residence on a rain-soaked evening, sabre in hand and wine on my breath. I roused him from his sleep and barged into his cottage, shouting obscenities and thrusting the bill of sale in his face. He shouted for me to leave, and shoved his frail shoulder into my side\u2014trying in vain to push me out the door. A great drunken rage swelled in my chest, and without a second thought I drove my sabre deep into his chest. It took only a moment to realize my folly. I tumbled back against the wall and gazed in horror at his feeble death throes. So deep and dark was my shame that I nearly took my own life on the spot. But in the end, I resolved to present myself to the Ascendants\u2014to face my justice.\nThe very curate who presented my calian as a youth sat in judgment. She fixed her icy gaze upon me as I recounted the tale. When I finally fell silent, she whispered something to her attending contemplative and rose to meet me. The contemplative took my ornate willow-wood box and opened it to reveal my calian\u2014my great and perfect treasure. With the steady hands of a jeweler, he plucked the sphere from its resting place and handed it to the curate. She gazed at me with a combination of sorrow and wrath. In silence, she held the calian aloft. My shoulders tightened as I dug my nails into my palms. Finally, she whispered the damning phrase, \"&lt;a href=\"Apraxis\"&gt;Apraxis&lt;/a&gt;\" and let the sphere slip through her fingers. I watched in horror as the precious heirloom tumbled through space and time, then shattered upon the cold marble floor. The curate and her contemplative turned their back, and lesser contemplatives ushered me, and the broken shards of my calian, out into the night.\nSo began my life as an apraxic\u2014a shamed outcast, left to contemplate the enormity of my sins in silent reflection.\nFor thirty years, I labored over the shattered remains of my blessed calian. I spent the last of my gold gathering stone-cutting tools, pearl-powder fixatives, and sacred oils. I ate little and slept not at all. My beard grew long and my muscles withered. With each success came three new failures. And all the while, my fellow Altmer spurned and cursed me.\nFinally, one bright morning in &lt;a href=\"Second%20Seed\"&gt;Second Seed&lt;/a&gt;, I set the last delicate shard of glass in its place\u2014returning the calian to its pristine origins. I felt such a swell of relief in that moment that I wept like a babe. At length, I washed myself in rosewater, sheared off my matted beard, and set out to the Hall of High Ascendency.\nI approached the curate on unsteady legs, my eyes fixed on the floor in deference. I opened my willow-wood box and held my calian up for inspection. The eerie silence seemed to last forever as the curate and her contemplative examined the sphere. Finally, I felt her hand upon my shoulder and heard her soft whisper. \"Rise.\"\nI reluctantly stood up and raised my eyes to meet hers.\nI could scarcely breathe when she spoke those long sought words: \"Welcome back, lost son of &lt;a href=\"Aldmeris\"&gt;Aldmeris&lt;/a&gt;.\""}

It's up to the Vestige to convince the delegates to return to the meeting and manage the situation before it spins out of control.\nBackground.\n\"Stormfist spies have used Daedric alchemy to infiltrate Fort Amol. The King and the Pact delegates are in danger. I need to convince someone that the threat is real before it's too late.\"\nWalkthrough.\nDuring the events of \"&lt;a href=\"Sleeping%20on%20the%20Job\"&gt;Sleeping on the Job&lt;/a&gt;,\" the Vestige has discovered a sinister plot by Stormfist spies to infiltrate the fort and impersonate its defenders by using Daedric alchemy. Upon informing Hloenor Chill-Owl, she will tell them the following.\n\"\"Listen, let's say I believe you. Let's say there are Stormfist agents impersonating people in Fort Amol. Even if all of this is true, we can't start a panic. The leaders of the Pact are here, for &lt;a href=\"Kyne\"&gt;Kyne's&lt;/a&gt; sake!\"\"\nThe Vestige must head to &lt;a href=\"Deldwine%27s%20Inn\"&gt;Deldwine's Inn&lt;/a&gt; and seek out Lord Vurlop there to inform him of what has taken place. Vurlop will be surprised by what the Vestige has discovered after he had sent them to trail &lt;a href=\"Commander%20Yjarnn\"&gt;Commander Yjarnn&lt;/a&gt; previously, and urges them to be subtle as not to damage the already fragile Pact alliance. Vurlop will go speak to Hloenor, and asks the Vestige to report to Thane Harvald, as he will know what to do. Once there, the Vestige will witness a heated exchange of words between Harvald and Prince Irnskar. Upon speaking to him, Harvald will explain the Prince lost his temper during a meeting of his own with the Pact delegates, and managed to insult them with posturing and boastfulness. After telling him of the Stormfist spies that have infiltrated the fort, he requests the Vestige visit the Dunmer and Argonian camps as a delegate of King Jorunn and do whatever it takes to convince them to return to the meeting. \nArriving at the Dunmer camp, the Vestige must speak to &lt;a href=\"Gelds%20Indoril\"&gt;Gelds Indoril&lt;/a&gt;, who holds contempt towards the Prince and refuses to listen to reason. He directs them to his servant, &lt;a href=\"Naryu%20Virian\"&gt;Naryu Virian&lt;/a&gt;. She will help the Vestige convince Gelds, as long as they bring her four bottles of Dunmer wine from the Fort Amol barracks. She directs the Vestige towards the river behind her, where she says they should be able to find a guard's uniform to help them sneak in undetected. If the Vestige has previously taken &lt;a href=\"Sentry%20Thod\"&gt;Sentry Thod&lt;/a&gt;'s uniform, they can use his as a disguise. Once the Vestige has donned the guard disguise and entered the barracks, they can overhear &lt;a href=\"Bottild\"&gt;Bottild&lt;/a&gt; mentioning his hatred of cats to &lt;a href=\"Kragfarr\"&gt;Kragfarr&lt;/a&gt;. Outright taking the bottle of Dunmer wine infront of the guards will raise suspicion, and the guards will kick the Vestige out. The Vestige will need to travel to the Argonian camp first to collect a &lt;a href=\"Cat%20%28Online%29\"&gt;cat&lt;/a&gt; and release it in the lower floor of the barracks to cause a distraction. Once Bottild is distracted, they can take the bottle of wine without issue. The second bottle of wine is located within a closet underneath the stairwell to the left of the barracks. On the second floor are two more bottles, one of which is in the office of &lt;a href=\"Sergeant%20Haldric%20Three-Boots\"&gt;Sergeant Haldric Three-Boots&lt;/a&gt;. Destroying the wooden crate outside of his office will cause him to investigate, and the Vestige can take the bottle undetected. Upon returning, Naryu will be pleased and promises the Vestige she will convince Gelds to return to the meeting. \nThe Vestige must now travel to the Argonian camp, where they will have to speak to &lt;a href=\"Runs-With-Quickness\"&gt;Runs-With-Quickness&lt;/a&gt;, who tells them the following.\n\"I think it figured out why cats like us so much. It's because we are so beautiful. And we smell good.\"\nI'll help your people if you agree to return to Prince Irnskar's meeting. \"It's too late to help Darkwater, but not to reclaim our honor. A deal then. If you remove the head of a large troll we call Death-In-Winter and bring it to me, I will consider returning to Irnskar's meeting. For the King.\"\nDarkwater Crossing is located southeast of Fort Amol. Once there, the Vestige will encounter a big troll named Death-In-Winter, who they must defeat. After killing the beast, they must collect its head and return to Runs-With-Quickness who thanks them for their effort and promises to return to Prince Irnskar's meeting.\nNow that the Vestige has convinced all the Pact delegates to return and reconcile, they must return and report to Thane Harvald. He will be impressed by the Vestige's efforts and rewards them, upon which the quest will be completed."}

This sacrifice will turn the runestone into the Rune Key of Malacath. If you sacrifice Raen, Sariel will give you a spirit totem that will fight alongside you as well as heal you until the end of the mission. If you sacrifice Sariel, . \nWhatever you choose, talk to the survivor and they will mention seeing rays of light from the towers surrounding the main building. The binding stones you need to destroy to free the Silvenar are there; head up the towers and use the Rune Key of Malacath to destroy the stones. Once you have destroyed all four, an apparition of the Silvenar will appear, and he will tell you that his prison is in the ofrtress on the hill. Fight your way in and enter the chieftain's chambers. Head downstairs and you will find the Silvenar lying on the ground. Talk to him and he will tell you that he will need time to recover all the magic the binding stones stole from him, and that you will have to protect him during that time. Several waves of Drublog soldiers will come down the stairs while te Silvenar is recovering, including &lt;a href=\"Chief%20Nagoth\"&gt;Chief Nagoth&lt;/a&gt; and his pet &lt;a href=\"Senche\"&gt;Senche&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Belaraam\"&gt;Belaraam&lt;/a&gt;. \nOnce all are defeated, speak with the Silvenar again. He will create a portal out of Jathsogur; head out, then speak with the Silvenar again to finish the quest and start the next one, \"&lt;a href=\"A%20Wedding%20to%20Attend\"&gt;A Wedding to Attend&lt;/a&gt;.\""}

Look well upon the &lt;a href=\"Chapel%20of%20Dibella\"&gt;Chapel of Dibella&lt;/a&gt;. Look at the faces of the dead. This is your future. Evil has returned, and the &lt;a href=\"Nine%20Divines\"&gt;Nine&lt;/a&gt; need a champion!\"\n\"Is there no one who would stand for the Nine? Now &lt;a href=\"Mara\"&gt;Mara&lt;/a&gt;'s children cry out from beyond the grave for vengeance! How many more must die at &lt;a href=\"Umaril%20the%20Unfeathered\"&gt;Umaril&lt;/a&gt;'s hand?\"\n\"I AM CYRODIIL COME, he said, Old &lt;a href=\"Reman%20Cyrodiil\"&gt;Reman&lt;/a&gt;, born from the earth that IS &lt;a href=\"Alessia\"&gt;Al-Esh&lt;/a&gt;, and yet he would scorn this country now!\"\n\"Repent! I say again, REPENT! The blood of &lt;a href=\"Dibella\"&gt;Dibella&lt;/a&gt;'s slaughtered acolytes cries out for vengeance. Vengeance! Who will take up this holy crusade?\"\n\"Love and Mercy! Do you still think me mad? Who shall next fall to Umaril's bloody revenge?

Heed it! Umaril is returned, as was foretold by the head of Pelinal to the &lt;a href=\"Morihaus\"&gt;Bull&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"Kyne\"&gt;Kyne&lt;/a&gt; in those days of old Cyrodiil. Who will walk the Pilgrim's Way, as did the questing &lt;a href=\"Knights%20of%20the%20Nine%20%28Faction%29\"&gt;knights&lt;/a&gt; of old? The blood tide rises! Will no one take up this holy crusade?

Umaril -- yes, your children know that name if you do not. The Dread Castellan of fearful legend. Did you think him a myth? Or dead? Have you not heard the &lt;a href=\"Amulet%20of%20Kings\"&gt;Abadal-a&lt;/a&gt;?\"\n\"Spoke Peninal: \"Beware, Morihaus, beware! With the foresight of death I know now that my foe yet lives, bitter knowledge to take to my grave...\" \"Better that I had died believing myself the victor. Although cast beyond the doors of night, he will return.\"\"Be vigilant! I can no longer shield the host of Men from Umaril's retribution.\" Thus spake Pelinal in the hour of his death.\"\n\"The Unfeathered has come during the &lt;a href=\"Oblivion%20Crisis\"&gt;Breaking of Gates&lt;/a&gt;! His golden-wickedness will hold fast against all arms except those of his ancient foe, the Whitestrake! The gate, once open, cares not who passeth through. Our ancient enemy has returned, from the deeps of time, to exact his revenge upon the gods. The gods, the Eight Attendants of Saint Pelinal when he smote down Umaril the Unfeathered...\"\n\"Are there no ears to hear the warnings? Are there no eyes to witness the Wheel's breaking? The Eight and One favor only the righteous! And too few of you remain! &lt;a href=\"The%20Thief%20%28Birthsign%29\"&gt;The Thief&lt;/a&gt; has found the lock that he cannot break! &lt;a href=\"The%20Warrior\"&gt;The Warrior&lt;/a&gt;, the foe that cannot fall! The Wizard, an incantation that takes not to his tongue!

No, you would not! This is plain! You looked away when the &lt;a href=\"Dragonfires\"&gt;fires&lt;/a&gt; flickered, and now act lost that they are gone! Only death remains for Tamriel! Death and oblivion!\"\n\"That all the Interplay is one flea of assertion on a wolf of naught.\" It is by these heresies that you fall from grace! Shame on you, people of Cyrodiil, and more shame for the children that you give freely to the mouth of Destruction! The Al-Esh is near! Mother of the Empire! She weeps for fallen Cyrod and all her children that call it home for truly she is the mother to us all! Citizens, the Queen of Stars asks you: where is her issue? Where are the men who can walk in her steps? In whose blood has the dragon taken purchase? Alessia! Reman! Talos! They cry for blood akin to theirs to rekindle the dragonpact!\"\n\"Citizens, take to your knives! Are there no ears to hear the warnings? Are there no eyes to witness the Wheel's breaking? You pore over your dusty tomes of &lt;a href=\"lore\"&gt;lore&lt;/a&gt;. You study ancient genealogies and bloodlines. Look you to blood for truth? There is truth in blood, but it is not the truth that you seek! The truth is written in the blood of the innocent, there in the Chapel of Love! Can you not read the ancient runes?\"\n\"As oiobala Umarile, Ehlnada racuvar!\" A curse and a threat to those who have eyes to see and ears to hear! Are there are any among you who still understand the ancient tongue? \"By the eternal power of Umaril, the mortal gods shall be cast down.\" Who will match the deeds of &lt;a href=\"Sir%20Amiel\"&gt;Sir Amiel&lt;/a&gt; and his companions when they smote the Wyrm of Elenglynn to recover the &lt;a href=\"Cuirass%20of%20the%20Crusader\"&gt;Cuirass of the Crusader&lt;/a&gt;? Think on this -- what happened here is only the beginning.\"\"\n&lt;a href=\"The%20Blessing%20of%20Talos\"&gt;The Blessing of Talos&lt;/a&gt;.\n\"... and so, nine knights, as the embodiment of the might of the Nine Divines, shall go forth together to face The Unfeathered. And he shall be cast down from on high, his wickedness scattered to the wind. He shall end his days as dust in the void. Go now, knights. Face the beast. Fear not death, for the Nine shall be your shield, and they shall you to rest should you fall.\""}

To some, the flame is a beacon of strength and guidance, to others, a mockery of their beliefs. It is the epicenter of a most interesting conflict; two sides of the same coin vying for the favor of their God. It is an unremarkable building with a most remarkable past. It is the Sacellum &lt;a href=\"Arden%20Sul\"&gt;Arden Sul&lt;/a&gt;.\nAlthough the Sacellum itself predates Arden-Sul's life, both the &lt;a href=\"Mania\"&gt;Manics&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Dementia\"&gt;Demented&lt;/a&gt; contest the history of the Sacellum heavily. The Manics believe that on that very spot before New Sheoth existed, Arden-Sul was first afflicted with the Grand Enlightenment and became blinded. The Demented postulate that the Sacellum was the location where Arden-Sul endured the Hundred Day Torture. However, it was not these purported events of Arden-Sul's life that aligned the Sacellum with the prophet's name... it was his death.\nHere again, the Manics and the Demented are divided. The Manics story of Arden-Sul's death begins with a night of superlative revelry in the Sacellum. The event was replete with a seemingly inexhaustible supply of &lt;a href=\"Greenmote\"&gt;Greenmote&lt;/a&gt; and spirits. Arden-Sul and his 213 followers engaged in a veritable orgy of merrymaking and overindulgence, a night fraught with a profusion of singing, dancing, and fornicating. As the celebration reached a crescendo and the event reached its whirlwind apex, one by one, Arden-Sul's followers began to drop to the ground--their lifeblood draining from their bodies until the ground was soaked a crimson red. The excesses of their hedonism had taken its toll and had caused their very hearts to explode. Although details are uncertain, it was said Arden-Sul was the last to die with the look of pure bliss upon his face.\nThe Demented have a radically different story of the events leading to Arden-Sul's demise. Fearing that one of his followers would one day turn traitor and bury a blade in his back, Arden-Sul sought a method to see deep into a man's soul and reveal his true feelings. After an exhaustive search, he uncovered the secrets of visceromancy, the science of divination through the observation of the entrails of others. Armed with this knowledge, he summoned his flock to the Sacellum. After imbibing the wine Arden-Sul gave them, his followers suddenly felt themselves paralyzed... aware of their surroundings but unable to move. Then, one by one, Arden-Sul cut out the still-beating hearts of his followers and read their lifeblood. After removing all 213 hearts, he still hadn't located the traitor. Furious, he reached into his chest and tore out his own heart. Before the light faded from his eyes, Arden-Sul was reported to have realized the ironic truth; he was the traitor, destined to kill himself.\nWhether or not one chooses to take either of these stories seriously is of little import. The truth remains that the Sacellum is a significant location of a highly regarded prophet's death. To this day, the building is still shared among the Manics and the Demented, and depending on Lord &lt;a href=\"Sheogorath\"&gt;Sheogorath&lt;/a&gt;'s whim, the favored side becomes its ruling body."}

I have traveled long and worked hard to help build Hakoshae. I am sure my actions have pleased those who came before me.\n18th of Hearthfire\nThe Proving Festival has begun, though it is laced with a bittersweet taste. I cannot help but remember that a mere three years ago we held this same celebration in our family's beautiful estate. There was feasting, dancing, music and more. A thousand stories were told, a thousand songs were sung, and beautiful decorations covered our home.\nThe Proving Festival in Hakoshae is a far simpler affair. There are no feasts, for we have little food to sustain us. There are no decorations, for all of our efforts have gone to building the town we now call home. The stories of grand adventures are told by tired elders, the labors of their day clinging heavily to their voices.\nBut still, I am grateful for the magnate's decision. It is good to feel &lt;a href=\"Akaviri\"&gt;Akaviri&lt;/a&gt; again.\n20th of Hearthfire\nMy sister spoke of a strange noise she heard last night. Slow, stumbling steps near her window. She awoke, but was too afraid to look outside.\nI told her that there was nothing to worry about, but my heart is now heavy. Everyone knows that the festival calls upon our ancestors to judge us. Depending on how well we have honored them, they will send us good fortune or bad luck. But to cross over to the realm of the living means that they have been greatly angered.\nI only pray that my ancestors were not the ones who visited Hakoshae last night. May they watch over us always, and happily remain within the afterlife.\n22nd of Hearthfire\nThe Proving Festival is complete, and no one has died a horrific death. I now believe my sister's story to be just a dream. Foolish of me to buy into her nightmares.\nThe closing ceremony had a strange air, however. The magnate, a usually solemn and stern man, seemed even more grim today. He spoke of the festival, and how we had honored our ancestors. A common speech, one that I've heard my own father recite many times.\nBut then he talked about how our actions every day prove ourselves to our ancestors. That we shouldn't have to beg them for attention, or prove ourselves with silly tasks and meaningless riddles. That just by building and maintaining Hakoshae, we have done more than enough to please those who came before us.\nI am unsettled by these statements. It almost sounds as if the magnate does not wish to hold the Proving Festival next year. I sincerely hope this not to be the case, of course. This Hearthfire, we celebrated an important part of Akaviri culture. I would hate for us to give that up, as we have already given up so much."}

Which brings up to the subject of this treatise. &lt;a href=\"Proxy%20Queen%20Alwinarwe\"&gt;Proxy Queen Alwinarwe&lt;/a&gt; has requested the &lt;a href=\"College%20of%20Sapiarchs\"&gt;College of Sapiarchs&lt;/a&gt; to provide the &lt;a href=\"Royal%20Palace%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Royal Palace&lt;/a&gt; with everything we know about the &lt;a href=\"Psijic%20Order%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Psijic Order&lt;/a&gt;. Apparently, the ancient order of arcane sages has returned to offer assistance during the current crisis.\nWe know with absolute certainty that the Psijic Order once served as advisors and teachers to the greatest rules of &lt;a href=\"Tamriel\"&gt;Tamriel&lt;/a&gt;. We also know that approximately three-hundred-and-fifty years ago, the sages retreated to their island of &lt;a href=\"Artaeum%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Artaeum&lt;/a&gt; to study in seclusion. Then the island, quite literally, disappeared.\nWhat is the Psijic Order? This ancient organization originated on Summerset and formed the basis for arcane magic as we know it today. At some point in history, they occupied the island of Artaeum and made &lt;a href=\"Ceporah%20Tower\"&gt;Ceporah Tower&lt;/a&gt; their headquarters. So much can be attributed to the Psijic Order, including the creation of the &lt;a href=\"Mages%20Guild%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Mages Guild&lt;/a&gt; (by former Psijic sage &lt;a href=\"Vanus%20Galerion%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Vanus Galerion&lt;/a&gt;) and the development of &lt;a href=\"Mysticism\"&gt;Mysticism&lt;/a&gt;. It has been claimed that Mysticism, or the Old Way, can unravel the mysteries of the universe when properly applied to the problem. It can also be used to peer into the future and may have been the basis of the advice they provided to Tamriel's leaders.\nWhen our ancestors settled Summerset, our culture began to change. We no longer worshiped the ancestor spirits, instead elevating a few of those spirits to godhood and revering them. A group of elders at this time rebelled against this trend. They called themselves Psijics, the keepers of the Old Ways. They retreated to Artaeum to remove themselves from the corruption of Altmer society. This dislike of the new ways didn't stop them from returning to offer advice and guidance, however.\nMy recommendation? Accept the help offered by the Psijic Order. We could do worse than to have these masters of Mysticism at our side in these times of trouble."}

Lucien's &lt;a href=\"Silencer\"&gt;Silencer&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"Hero%20of%20Kvatch\"&gt;Hero&lt;/a&gt;, was recruited after the spy was known to the &lt;a href=\"Black%20Hand\"&gt;Black Hand&lt;/a&gt; and is therefore above suspicion, so they are charged with the task.\nWalkthrough.\nPurifying the Sanctuary.\nWhen the Hero goes to talk to Ocheeva for the next contract, she will give them a package with orders to go to &lt;a href=\"Fort%20Farragut\"&gt;Fort Farragut&lt;/a&gt; to speak with &lt;a href=\"Lucien%20Lachance%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;Lucian Lachance&lt;/a&gt;. The Hero may choose to enter through the main entrance and fight or sneak past all of the guardians to the final room. Alternatively, there is a hidden exit from Lucien's room to a trap door in a tree to the northwest of the fort. Entering this way short-circuits the need to go all the way through the fort. When the Hero talks to Lucien, the latter will give them the task of exterminating all Dark Brotherhood members in the Cheydinhal Dark Brotherhood Sanctuary. Before sending them on their way, he will give them a unique &lt;a href=\"Summon%20Rufio%27s%20Ghost\"&gt;scroll&lt;/a&gt; to summon the ghost of &lt;a href=\"Rufio\"&gt;Rufio&lt;/a&gt; to aid them in combat as well as a &lt;a href=\"Poisoned%20Apple\"&gt;Poisoned Apple&lt;/a&gt;. The rule that normally results in expulsion from the Brotherhood when killing another member is temporarily ignored while this quest is active.\nThere are seven members in all who need to be exterminated:\nNote that there are two more occupants of the Sanctuary, the &lt;a href=\"Dark%20Guardian%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;Dark Guardian&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Rat%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;Rat&lt;/a&gt; named &lt;a href=\"Schemer\"&gt;Schemer&lt;/a&gt;. It is not necessary to kill them to complete the quest, though the Guardian will attack the Hero if they openly assault another Brotherhood member. A very simple way to take care of the Guardian is to move under the ladder to the secret entrance to the surface, which is located in the main area of the Sanctuary. From this position, one can fire arrows or destructive magic at the Guardian, and it won't be able to reach them. It is also important to note that the Dark Guardian respawns.\nWays to kill.\nThere are many ways to exterminate the other members, and any method that ends in their death will complete the quest. Here are a few methods:\nFive Dark Brotherhood members carry keys which open their chests in the living quarters. There is some good loot in the chests.\nConclusion.\nAfter killing all seven members, travel back to Fort Farragut, where Lachance will give the next quest. All Cheydinhal Dark Brotherhood members are dead, so the Hero will not receive any more contracts there.\nThe Hero will advance to \"Silencer\" rank and receive new contracts from Dead Drops, which contain all necessary info for the next contract, and the reward for the previous one. Lachance also rewards them with a unique horse named &lt;a href=\"Shadowmere%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;Shadowmere&lt;/a&gt;, which will be waiting outside the fort upon exiting."}

Now it makes sense, Uriel Septim adressed the message to the Queen of Daggerfall. When he sent it, I was Queen of Daggerfall. By the time it arrived, my dear Lysandus was dead and Aubk-i was queen. We must find out what was in that letter. I have never trusted Aubk-i. Yesterday I received a letter from Princess Morgiah of Wayrest claiming to know something of the emperor's letter. Now there is a family that seethes under the rule of the Emperor. Return to me if you find out who has the emperor's letter. For now, you have proven yourself to me . Keep the as a token of my gratitude. I have no desire to own anything of Aubk-i's anymore.\"\n\"So Morgiah says Gortwog has the emperor's letter. Very interesting. I think I have a way to get Gortwog to turn over that letter. Are you willing to brave the depths of Orsinium to retrieve it?\"\nUpon returning with the letter:\n\", this letter is dangerous. Gortwog has undoubtedly sold copies of it to everyone from Wayrest to the Underking. After all, if the powers of the Iliac Bay become embroiled in war over the Totem, he stands to gain quite a lot. Go now. You have done your job. I am sure the Totem will find its way into your life somehow. You seem to have a knack for such things, just remember that the only safe master of the Totem is the emperor.\"\n\"Lord Woodborne is the slayer of my dear Lysandus. There shall be justice, and it shall come from my hand! You would do best to stay clear of Woodborne Hall and Wayrest for some time .\""}

The regional deity is &lt;a href=\"Kynareth\"&gt;Kynareth&lt;/a&gt;.\nDescription.\nGeography.\nMyrkwasa is one of the 23 realms located across the Iliac Bay on the Hammerfell side of the bay. Myrkwasa is bordered by &lt;a href=\"Kairou\"&gt;Kairou&lt;/a&gt; to the west, &lt;a href=\"Pothago\"&gt;Pothago&lt;/a&gt; to the northwest, &lt;a href=\"Sentinel\"&gt;Sentinel&lt;/a&gt; Kingdom to the east, and the &lt;a href=\"Alik%27r\"&gt;Alik'r&lt;/a&gt; to the south. But traditionally, Myrkwasa borders the &lt;a href=\"Hollow%20Wastes\"&gt;Hollow Wastes&lt;/a&gt; to the east and &lt;a href=\"Khefrem\"&gt;Khefrem&lt;/a&gt; to the south.\nHistory.\n&lt;a href=\"Second%20Era\"&gt;Second Era&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe Rising of the Dead in Sentinel.\nIn &lt;a href=\"2E%20582\"&gt;2E 582&lt;/a&gt;, a group of &lt;a href=\"Necromancer\"&gt;Necromancer&lt;/a&gt;s known as the &lt;a href=\"Withered%20Hand\"&gt;Withered Hand&lt;/a&gt; had risen in Myrkwasa and resurrected dead warriors &amp; sailors referred to as the &lt;a href=\"Ra-Netu\"&gt;Ra-Netu&lt;/a&gt;. They began to appear on the &lt;a href=\"Sentinel%20Docks\"&gt;Sentinel Docks&lt;/a&gt; and attacked incoming ships in a fury. The Grand Army of Sentinel had kept the Ra-Netu at bay from the inner city while the Sentinel Watch are trapped on the Docks. A warrior that was known as the &lt;a href=\"Vestige\"&gt;Vestige&lt;/a&gt; defeated the Ra-Netu on the docks and rendezvous with &lt;a href=\"King%20Fahara%27jad\"&gt;King Fahara'jad&lt;/a&gt; of Sentinel. The Withered Hand had broken into the &lt;a href=\"Impervious%20Vault\"&gt;Impervious Vault&lt;/a&gt; and took the &lt;a href=\"Ansei%20Wards\"&gt;Ansei Wards&lt;/a&gt;. Fahara'jad tasked the Vestige into traveling the desert to find the &lt;a href=\"Ash%27abah\"&gt;Ash'abah&lt;/a&gt; and one of the Ansei Wards in Myrkwasa.\nBecoming one with the Ash'abah.\nThe Ash'abah Tribe of Redguards is pariah group that is shunned by Redguard Society for their mistreatment on the dead, something that is sacred to the people of Hammerfell. Only the Ash'abah can take on the Withered Hand and their forces, but the Vestige must become one of the Ash'abah, by performing a series of tasks. The Vestige underwent a vision that took them to the &lt;a href=\"First%20Era\"&gt;First Era&lt;/a&gt; when the &lt;a href=\"Yokudan\"&gt;Yokudan&lt;/a&gt;s fought the &lt;a href=\"Corelanya%20Clan\"&gt;Corelanya Clan&lt;/a&gt; of the &lt;a href=\"Altmer\"&gt;Altmer&lt;/a&gt;. After completing a few trials, the Vestige joined the Ash'abah and traveled to &lt;a href=\"Tu%27whacca%27s%20Throne\"&gt;Tu'whacca's Throne&lt;/a&gt;, where one of the Ansei Wards are located.\nThe Gateway to the Far Shores; Tu'whacca's Throne.\n&lt;a href=\"Uwafa\"&gt;Uwafa&lt;/a&gt; and his two siblings are leaders of the Withered Hand and planned on using the Ansei Wards to revive an army of Ra-Netu and their father, &lt;a href=\"Suturah\"&gt;Suturah&lt;/a&gt; of the Withered Hand. The two siblings disappeared into the Alik'r, but Uwafa went to Tu'whacca's Throne and resurrected an army of &lt;a href=\"Mummy\"&gt;Mummies&lt;/a&gt; to defend him. The Ash'abah led a force to the Throne and the Vestige advanced to the middle and met &lt;a href=\"Throne%20Keeper%20Farvad\"&gt;Throne Keeper Farvad&lt;/a&gt;, caretaker of the Temple. With his help, the Vestige was able to defeat Uwafa and restore Tu'whacca's Throne. The second brother, &lt;a href=\"Alasan\"&gt;Alasan&lt;/a&gt; was said to flee to the &lt;a href=\"Hollow%20Wastes\"&gt;Hollow Wastes&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Lainlyn\"&gt;Tava's Blessing&lt;/a&gt;.\n&lt;a href=\"Third%20Era\"&gt;Third Era&lt;/a&gt;.\nMyrkwasa in the Warp in the West.\nDuring the &lt;a href=\"Warp%20in%20the%20West\"&gt;Warp in the West&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"3E%20405\"&gt;3E 405&lt;/a&gt;, the Myrkwasa fiefdom was independent among the other 23 kingdoms in the Iliac Bay. The city of Sentinel seceded from the Myrkwasa fiefdom and formed the Kingdom of Sentinel with the city being its capital. A new city was built, and it was named after the Dwemer ruins of &lt;a href=\"Santaki\"&gt;Santaki&lt;/a&gt;. It had also seceded from Myrkwasa. Later in the same year, Myrkwasa along with Santaki were annexed into the Kingdom of Sentinel."}

The motivations for their flight aside (and before I digress into &lt;a href=\"Dawn%20Era\"&gt;Dawn Era&lt;/a&gt; origination theories and thought experiments about a Nirn completely separated from Aetherius), the stars, their power, and their arrangements have long been subjects of intense study and even worship in some cultures.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Ayleid\"&gt;Ayleid&lt;/a&gt;s are commonly associated with the practice of &lt;a href=\"Aetherial%20magic\"&gt;Aetherial magic&lt;/a&gt;. You can learn more about their creations in my work &lt;a href=\"Aetherial%20Fragments\"&gt;Aetherial Fragments&lt;/a&gt;, but suffice it to say they were able to manipulate and store starlight in ways we have yet to fully comprehend. The &lt;a href=\"Nede%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Nedic&lt;/a&gt; people also had an interest in the stars, though their culture was focused on theology over magical study. However, there is evidence that the highest echelons of Nedic priesthood preserved ancient rituals that invoked Aetherial magic. If what remains of their ponderous, flowery, and excruciating-to-translate poetry is any indication, they had a particular fascination with the constellations and their aspects.\nThe constellations each occupy their own magical domains, as evidenced by the observable energies that emanate from Mundus Stones and their ability to instill power into individuals. We do not know who erected these stones (which can be found across all the provinces of Tamriel) or for what purpose, but their magical resonance tells us clearly that each constellation's signature is quite unique. This raises questions: were the individual constellations deliberately formed the Magna-Ge, imparting their essence into the trans-constellatory light? Is each constellation a window into a different Aetherial realm, such as &lt;a href=\"Sovngarde%20%28Location%29\"&gt;Sovngarde&lt;/a&gt; or the &lt;a href=\"The%20Far%20Shores\"&gt;Far Shores&lt;/a&gt;?\nMy own careful examination of several of the stones in the &lt;a href=\"Alik%27r%20Desert%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Alik'r Desert&lt;/a&gt;, which nearly exhausted my limited funding, revealed a curious phenomenon. Everyone knows that the guardian constellations \u2014 &lt;a href=\"the%20Mage\"&gt;the Mage&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"The%20Thief\"&gt;Thief&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"The%20Warrior\"&gt;Warrior&lt;/a&gt;\u2014are said to protect the other constellations from the destructive chaos of the Serpent, but my research may have exposed part of the magical underpinning of this legend. A survey of &lt;a href=\"The%20Warrior%20%28Online%29\"&gt;the warrior stone&lt;/a&gt; uncovered strong Aetherial currents traveling from the stars into the stone and radiating outward, implying a cross-&lt;a href=\"Tamriel\"&gt;Tamriel&lt;/a&gt;ic web. Why no other scholar or mage has commented on this, I cannot say. Mundus Stones are poorly studied, and it is possible that this energy is not always active.\nI theorize that there are other, related stones, as yet undiscovered, that further focus the power of the constellations. Could these magical pathways be manipulated\u2014or, even more interestingly, reversed\u2014to create a kind of Aetherial feedback? What would this permit us to achieve, and what would it teach us of the very nature of the relationship between Mundus and Aetherius?\nI fear that my work in this area has introduced more questions than it has answers, but you are undoubtedly as thrilled as I am by the implications of this research. Sadly, I have experienced difficulty in procuring additional funding for this project, and I am searching for new sponsors. I hope to pursue this intriguing discovery further as soon as possible."}

Beside it stood an old woman, who I took for its keeper.\nTaking note of my apprehension, the old woman beckoned me forward. Wordlessly she raised her hand, and directed it to the altar. She was asking me to choose.\nIn my travels I have passed through &lt;a href=\"Hagraven%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;hagraven&lt;/a&gt; camps and seen many a twisted thing, but none like this. Placed in its gnarled hands were three empty bowls, and a cup to fill them.\nAt last the old woman spoke, with an accent I couldn't place. The first bowl, she said, would grant you power. The second would bring you fortune. The third, however, would offer you nothing at all.\nLooking back now, I can't tell you if any of this was real, or some hallucination I dreamt up to cope with the fever. Or it could be the altar was no different from a &lt;a href=\"Standing%20Stones\"&gt;standing stone&lt;/a&gt;, a tribute to a god long forgotten. Still, I felt compelled to ask the woman how and where I would find my boon. She said it would come to me.\nUnfortunately, the ataxia has cursed me with sleeplessness. Worse yet, the disease has progressed to a point that I fear I will not live to see the outcome of my choice. A shame, as I wonder even now if I have made the right one.\n--Rulnik Wind-Strider"}

The occasion was the millennial celebration of the founding of the &lt;a href=\"Breton\"&gt;Breton&lt;/a&gt; Kingdom of &lt;a href=\"Camlorn\"&gt;Camlorn&lt;/a&gt;. Every grand boulevard and narrow alley was strung with gold and purple banners, some plain, some marked with the heraldic symbols of the Royal Family or the various principalities and dukedoms which were vassals of the King. Musicians played in the plazas great and small, and on every street corner was a new exotic entertainer: Redguard snake charmers, &lt;a href=\"Khajiit\"&gt;Khajiit&lt;/a&gt;i acrobats, magicians of genuine power and those whose flamboyant skill was equally impressive if largely illusion.\nThe sight that drew most of the male citizens of Camlorn was the &lt;a href=\"March%20of%20Beauty\"&gt;March of Beauty&lt;/a&gt;. A thousand comely young women, brightly and provocatively dressed, danced their way down the long, wide main street of the city, from the Temple of &lt;a href=\"Sethiete\"&gt;Sethiete&lt;/a&gt; to the Royal Palace. The menfolk jostled one another and craned their necks, picking their favorites. It was no secret that they were all prostitutes, and after the March and the &lt;a href=\"Flower%20Festival\"&gt;Flower Festival&lt;/a&gt; that evening, they would be available for more intimate business.\nGyna attracted much of the attention with her tall, curvaceous figure barely covered by strips of silk and her curls of flaxen hair specked with flower petals. In her late twenties, she wasn't the youngest of the prostitutes, but she was certainly one of the most desirable. It was clear by her demeanor that she was used to the lascivious glances, though she was far from jaded at the sight of the city in splendor. Compared to the squalid quarter of &lt;a href=\"Daggerfall\"&gt;Daggerfall&lt;/a&gt; where she made her home, &lt;a href=\"Camlorn\"&gt;Camlorn&lt;/a&gt; at the height of celebration seemed so unreal. And yet, what was even stranger was how, at the same time, familiar it all looked, though she had never been there before.\nThe King's daughter Lady Jyllia rode out of the palace gates, and immediately cursed her misfortune. She had completely forgotten about the March of Beauty. The streets were snarled, at a standstill. It would take hours to wait for the March to pass, and she had promised her old nurse Ramke a visit in her house south of the city. Jyllia thought for a moment, picturing in her mind the arrangement of streets in the city, and devised a shortcut to avoid the main street and the March.\nFor a few minutes she felt very clever as she wound her way through tight, curving side streets, but presently she came upon temporary structures, tents and theaters set up for the celebration, and had to improvise a new path. In no time at all, she was lost in the city where she had lived all but five years of her life.\nPeering down an alley, she saw the main avenue crowded with the March of Beauty. Hoping that it was the tale end, and desirous not to be lost again, Lady Jyllia guided her horse toward the festival. She did not see the snake-charmer at the mouth of the alley, and when his pet hissed and spread its hood, her charge reared up in fear.\nThe women in the parade gasped and surged back at the sight, but Lady Jyllia quickly calmed her stallion down. She looked abashed at the spectacle she had caused.\n\"My apologies, ladies,\" she said with a mock military salute.\n\"It's all right, madam,\" said a blonde in silk. \"We'll be out of your way in a moment.\"\nJyllia stared as the March passed her. Looking at that whore had been like looking in a mirror. The same age, and height, and hair, and eyes, and figure, almost exactly. The woman looked back at her, and it seemed as if she was thinking the same thing.\nAnd so Gyna was. The old witches who sometimes came in to Daggerfall had sometimes spoke of &lt;a href=\"Doppelganger%20%28Daggerfall%29\"&gt;doppelgangers&lt;/a&gt;, spirits that assumed the guise of their victims and portended certain death. Yet the experience had not frightened her: it seemed only one more strangely familiar aspect of the alien city. Before the March had danced it way into the palace gates, she had all but forgotten the encounter.\nThe prostitutes crushed into the courtyard, as the King himself came to the balcony to greet them. At his side was his chief bodyguard, a battlemage by the look of him. As for the King himself, he was a handsome man of middle age, rather unremarkable, but Gyna was awed at the sight of him. A dream, perhaps. Yes, that was it: she could see him as she had dreamt of him, high above her as he was now, bending now to kiss her. Not a one of lust as she had experienced before, but one of small fondness, a dutiful kiss.\n\"Dear ladies, you have filled the streets of the great capitol of Camlorn with your beauty,\" cried the King, forcing a silence on the giggling, murmuring assembly. He smiled proudly. His eyes met Gyna's and he stopped, shaken. For an eternity, they stayed locked together before His Highness recovered and continued his speech.\nAfterwards, while the women were all en route back to their tents to change into their costumes for the evening, one of the older prostitutes approached Gyna: \"Did you see how the King looked at you? If you're smart, you'll be the new royal mistress before this celebration ends.\"\n\"I've seen looks of hunger before, and that wasn't one of them,\" laughed Gyna. \"I'd wager he thought I was someone else, like that lady who tried to run us over with her horse. She's probably his kin, and he thought she had dressed up like a courtesan and joined the March of Beauty. Can you imagine the scandal?\"\nWhen they arrived at the tents, they were greeted by a stocky, well-dressed young man with a bald pate and a commanding presence of authority. He introduced himself as Lord Strale, ambassador to the Emperor himself, and their chief patron. It was Strale who had hired them, on the Emperor's behalf, as a gift to the King and the kingdom of Camlorn.\n\"The March of Beauty is but a precursor to the Flower Festival tonight,\" he said. Unlike the King, he did not have to yell to be heard. His voice was loud and precise in its natural modulations. \"I expect each of you to perform well, and justify the significant expense I've suffered bringing you all the way up here. Now hurry, you must be dressed and in position on &lt;a href=\"Cavilstyr%20Rock\"&gt;Cavilstyr Rock&lt;/a&gt; before the sun goes down.\"\nThe ambassador needn't have worried. The women were all professionals, experts at getting dressed and undressed with none of the time-consuming measures less promiscuous females required. His manservant Gnorbooth offered his assistance, but found he had little to do. Their costumes were simplicity itself: soft, narrow sheets with a hole for their heads. Not even a belt was required, so the gowns were open at the sides exposing the frame of their skin.\nSo it was long before the sun had set that the prostitutes turned dancers were at &lt;a href=\"Cavilstyr%20Rock\"&gt;Cavilstyr Rock&lt;/a&gt;. It was a great, wide promontory facing the sea, and for the occasion of the Festival of Flowers, a large circle of unlit torches and covered baskets had been arranged. As early as they were, a crowd of spectators had already arrived. The women gathered in the center of the circle and waited until it was time.\nGyna watched the crowd as it grew, and was not surprised when she saw the lady from the March approaching, hand-in-hand with a very old, very short white-haired woman. The old woman was distracted, pointing out islands out at sea. The blonde lady seemed nervous, unsure of what to say. Gyna was used to dealing with uneasy clients, and spoke first.\n\"Good to see you again, madam. I am Gyna of Daggerfall.\"\n\"I'm glad you bear me no ill will because of the whores, I mean horse,\" the lady laughed, somewhat relieved. \"I am Lady Jyllia Raze, daughter of the King.\"\n\"I always thought that daughters of kings were called princess,\" smiled Gyna.\n\"In Camlorn, only when they are heirs to the throne. I have a younger brother from my father's new wife whom he favors,\" Jyllia replied. She felt her head swim. It was madness, speaking to a common prostitute, talking of family politics so intimately. \"Relative to that subject, I must ask you something very peculiar. Have you ever heard of the &lt;a href=\"Princess%20Talara\"&gt;Princess Talara&lt;/a&gt;?\"\nGyna thought a moment: \"The name sounds somewhat familiar. Why would I have?\"\n\"I don't know. It was a name I just thought you might recognize,\" sighed Lady Jyllia. \"Have you been to Camlorn before?\"\n\"If I did, it was when I was very young,\" said Gyna, and suddenly she felt it was her turn to be trusting. Something about the Lady Jyllia's friendly and forthcoming manner touched her. \"To be honest, I don't remember anything at all of my childhood before I was nine or ten. Perhaps I was here with my parents, whoever they were, when I was a little girl. I tell you, I think perhaps I was. I don't recall ever being here before, but everything I've seen, the city, you, the King himself, all seem ... like I've been here before, long ago.\"\nLady Jyllia gasped and took a step back. She gripped the old woman, who had been looking out to sea and murmuring, by the hand. The elderly creature looked to Jyllia, surprised, and then turned to Gyna. Her ancient, half-blind eyes sparkled with recognition and she made a sound like a grunt of surprise. Gyna also jumped. If the King had seemed like something out of a half-forgotten dream, this woman was someone she knew. As clear and yet indistinct as a guardian spirit.\n\"I apologize,\" stammered Lady Jyllia. \"This is my childhood nursemaid, Ramke.\"\n\"It's her!\" the old woman cried, wild-eyed. She tried to run forward, arms outstretched, but Jyllia held her back. Gyna felt strangely naked, and pulled her robe against her body.\n\"No, you're wrong,\" Lady Jyllia whispered to Ramke, holding the old woman tightly. \"The Princess Talara is dead, you know that. I shouldn't have brought you here. I'll take you back home.\" She turned back to Gyna, her eyes welling with tears. \"The entire royal family of Camlorn was assassinated over twenty years ago. My father was Duke of &lt;a href=\"Oloine\"&gt;Oloine&lt;/a&gt;, the King's brother, and so he inherited the crown. I'm sorry to have bothered you. Goodnight.\"\nGyna gazed after Lady Jyllia and the old nurse as they disappeared into the crowd, but she had little time to consider all she had heard. The sun was setting, and it was time for the Flower Festival. Twelve young men emerged from the darkness wearing only loincloths and masks, and lit the torches. The moment the fire blazed, Gyna and all the rest of the dancers rushed to the baskets, pulling out blossoms and vines by the handful.\nAt first, the women danced with one another, sprinkling petals to the wind. The crowd then joined in as the music swelled. It was a mad, beautiful chaos. Gyna leapt and swooned like a wild forest nymph. Then, without warning, she felt rough hands grip her from behind and push her.\nShe was falling before she understood it. The moment the realization hit, she was closer to the bottom of the hundred foot tall cliff than she was to the top. She flailed out her arms and grasped at the cliff wall. Her fingers raked against the stone and her flesh tore, but she found a grip and held it. For a moment, she stayed there, breathing hard. Then she began to scream.\nThe music and the festival were too loud up above: no one could hear her - she could scarcely hear herself. Below her, the surf crashed. Every bone in her body would snap if she fell. She closed her eyes, and a vision came. A man was standing below her, a King of great wisdom, great compassion, looking up, smiling. A little girl, golden-haired, mischievous, her best friend and cousin, clung to the rock beside her.\n\"The secret to falling is making your body go limp. And with luck, you won't get hurt,\" the girl said. She nodded, remembering who she was. Eight years of darkness lifted.\nShe released her grip and let herself fall like a leaf into the water below."}

Pain surged through her leg and with that sensation, a great feeling of cold washed over her. She opened her eyes and saw that she was drowning.\nHer left leg would not move at all, but using her right one and her arms, she pulled herself up toward the moons above. It was long way through the swirling currents that wrenched back at her. At last she broke the surface and sucked in the cold night air. She was still close to the rocky shoreline of the capitol city of the kingdom of &lt;a href=\"Camlorn\"&gt;Camlorn&lt;/a&gt;, but the water had carried her quite a ways from the point where she fell at &lt;a href=\"Cavilstyr%20Rock\"&gt;Cavilstyr Rock&lt;/a&gt;.\nNot fell, she thought, correcting herself. She had been pushed.\nFurther down current, she allowed herself to drift. There the steep cliff walls sloped lower until they were close to the water's edge. The silhouette of a large house on the shore loomed ahead, and as she neared it, she could see smoke rising from the chimney and the flicker of firelight within. The pain in her leg was great, but greater still was the chill of the water. The thought of a warm hearth fire was all the motivation she needed to begin swimming again.\nAt the shore's edge, she tried to stand but found she couldn't. Her tears mixed with the sea water as she began to crawl across the sand and rock. The simple white sheet which had been her costume at the &lt;a href=\"Flower%20Festival\"&gt;Flower Festival&lt;/a&gt; was tattered and felt like a weight of lead across her back. Beyond the point of exhaustion, she fell forward and began to sob.\n\"Please!\" she cried. \"If you can hear me, please help!\"\nA moment later, the door to the house opened and a woman stepped out. It was Ramke, the old lady she had met at the Flower Festival. The one who had started and cried \"It's her!\" even before she herself knew who she was. By contrast, when the old woman came to her, this time there was no glimmer of recognition in her eyes.\n\"By &lt;a href=\"Sethiete\"&gt;Sethiete&lt;/a&gt;, are you hurt?\" Ramke whispered, and helped her up, acting as her crutch. \"I've seen that gown before. Were you one of the dancers at the Flower Festival tonight? I was there with Lady Jyllia Raze, the daughter of the King.\"\n\"I know, she introduced us,\" she groaned. \"I called myself Gyna of &lt;a href=\"Daggerfall\"&gt;Daggerfall&lt;/a&gt;?\"\n\"Of course, I knew you looked familiar somehow,\" the old woman chuckled, and led her hop by hop across the beach and into the front door. \"My memory isn't as good as it used to be. Lets get you warm and have a look at that leg.\"\nRamke took Gyna's soaking rags and covered her with a blanket as she sat at the fire. As the numbness of the chill water began to leave her, it cruelly abandoned her to the intense agony of her leg. Until then, she had not dared to look at it. When she did, she felt vomit rise at the sight of the deep gash, fish-white dead flesh, plump and swollen. Thick arterial blood bubbled up, splashing on the floor in streams.\n\"Oh dear,\" said the old woman, returning to the fire. \"That must rather sting. You're lucky that I still remember a little of the old healing spells.\"\nRamke seated herself on the floor and pressed her hands on either side of the wound. Gyna felt a flare of pain, and then a cool soft pinching and prickle. When she looked down, Ramke was slowly sliding her wrinkled hands towards one another. At their approach, the lesion began to mend before her eyes, flesh binding and bruises fading.\n\"Sweet &lt;a href=\"Kynareth\"&gt;Kynareth&lt;/a&gt;,\" Gyna gasped. \"You've saved my life.\"\n\"Not only that, you won't have an ugly scar on your pretty leg,\" Ramke chuckled. \"I had to use that spell so many times when Lady Jyllia was little. You know, I was her nursemaid.\"\n\"I know,\" Gyna smiled. \"But that was a long time ago, and you still remember the spell.\"\n\"Oh, when you're learning anything, even the &lt;a href=\"Schools%20of%20Magic\"&gt;School&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"Restoration\"&gt;Restoration&lt;/a&gt;, there's always a lot of study and mistakes, but once you're as old as I am, there's no longer any need to remember things. You just know. After all, I've probably cast it a thousand times before. Little Lady Jyllia and the little &lt;a href=\"Princess%20Talara\"&gt;Princess Talara&lt;/a&gt; was always getting cut and bruised. Small wonder, the way they was always climbing all over the palace.\"\nGyna sighed. \"You must have loved Lady Jyllia very much.\"\n\"I still do,\" Ramke beamed. \"But now she's all grown and things are different. You know, I didn't notice it before because you were all wet from the sea, but you look very much like my lady. Did I mention that before when we met at the Festival?\"\n\"You did,\" said Gyna. \"Or rather I think you thought I looked like Princess Talara.\"\n\"Oh, it would be so wonderful if you were the Princess returned,\" the old woman gasped. \"You know, when the former royal family was killed, and everyone said the Princess was killed though we never found the body, I think the real victim was Lady Jyllia. Her little heart just broke, and for a while, it looked like her mind did too.\"\n\"What do you mean?\" asked Gyna. \"What happened?\"\n\"I don't know if I should tell a stranger this, but it's fairly well-known in Camlorn, and I really feel like I know you,\" Ramke struggled with her conscience and then released. \"Jyllia saw the assassination, you see. I found her afterwards, hiding in that terrible blood-stained throne room, and she was like a little broken doll. She wouldn't speak, she wouldn't eat. I tried all my healing spells, but it was quite beyond my power. So much more than a scraped knee. Her father who was then Duke of &lt;a href=\"Oloine\"&gt;Oloine&lt;/a&gt; sent her to a sanitarium in the country to get well.\"\n\"That poor little girl,\" cried Gyna.\n\"It took her years to be herself again,\" said Ramke, nodding. \"And, in truth, she never really returned altogether. You wonder why her father when he was made king didn't make her his heir? He thought that she was still not exactly right, and in a way, as much as I would deny it, he's correct to think so. She remembered nothing, nothing at all.\"\n\"Do you think,\" Gyna considered her words carefully. \"That she would be better if she knew that her cousin the Princess Talara was alive and well?\"\nRamke considered it. \"I think so. But maybe not. Sometimes it's best not to hope.\"\nGyna stood up, finding her leg to be as strong as it looked to be. Her gown had dried, and Ramke gave her a cloak, insisting she protect herself against the cold night air. At the door, Gyna kissed the old woman's cheek and thanked her. Not only for the healing spell and for the cloak, but for everything else of kindness she had ever done.\nThe road close to the house went north and south. To the left was the way back to Camlorn, where secrets lay to which she alone held the key. To the south was Daggerfall, her home for more than twenty years. She could return there, back to her profession on the streets, very easily. For a few seconds, she considered her options, and then made her choice.\nShe had not been walking for very long, when a black carriage drawn by three horses bearing the Imperial Seal, together with eight mounted horses, passed her. Before it rounded the wooded pass ahead, it stopped suddenly. She recognized one of the soldiers as Gnorbooth, Lord Strale's manservant. The door opened and Lord Strale himself, the &lt;a href=\"Emperor\"&gt;Emperor&lt;/a&gt;'s ambassador, the man who had hired her and all the other women to entertain at court, stepped out.\n\"You!' he frowned. \"You're one of the prostitutes, aren't you? You're the one who disappeared during the Flower Festival? Gyna, am I right?\"\n\"All that is true,\" she smiled sourly. \"Except my name I've discovered is not Gyna.\"\n\"I don't care what it is,\" said Lord Strale. \"What are you doing on the south road? I paid for you to stay and make the kingdom merry.\"\n\"If I went back to &lt;a href=\"Camlorn\"&gt;Camlorn&lt;/a&gt;, there are a great many who wouldn't be merry at all.\"\n\"Explain yourself,\" said Lord Strale.\nSo she did. And he listened."}

What I've been wondering is what you've been busy doing.\"\n\"Protecting the &lt;a href=\"Imperial\"&gt;Imperial&lt;/a&gt; interests in Camlorn is busy work, milord.

Lord Eryl was too canny an actor to reveal it, but Gnorbooth knew at the pit of his stomach that the battlemage did not even know Lord Strale had left the capitol. He had to get away to let the ambassador know, but there was still a game to be carefully played. \"He's not leaving for there until tomorrow. I believe it's just to put a stamp on some deed that needs the Imperial Seal.\"\n\"Is that all? How tedious for the poor fellow. I suppose I'll see him when he returns then,\" Lord Eryl bowed. \"Thank you for being so informative. Farewell.\"\nThe moment the royal battlemage turned the corner, Gnorbooth leapt onto his horse. He had drunk one or two ales too many, but he knew he must find his way to Umbington before Lord Eryl's agents did. He galloped east out of the capitol, hoping there were signs along the road.\nSeated in a tavern that smelled of mildew and sour beer, Lord Strale marveled at how the &lt;a href=\"Emperor\"&gt;Emperor's&lt;/a&gt; agent Lady &lt;a href=\"Brisienna\"&gt;Brisienna&lt;/a&gt; always found the most public of places for her most private of conferences. It was harvest time in Umbington, and all of the field hands were drinking away their meager wages in the noisiest of fashions. He was dressed appropriately for the venue, rough trousers and a simple peasant's vest, but he still felt conspicuous. In comparison to his two female companions, he certainly was. The woman to his right was used to frequenting the low places of &lt;a href=\"Daggerfall\"&gt;Daggerfall&lt;/a&gt; as a common prostitute. Lady Brisienna to his left was even more clearly in her element.\n\"By what name would you prefer I call you?\" Lady Brisienna asked solicitously.\n\"I am used to the name Gyna, though that may have to change,\" was her reply. \"Of course, it may not. Gyna the Whore may be the name writ on my grave.\"\n\"I will see to it that there is no attempt on your life like that the Flower Festival,\" Lord Strale frowned. \"But without the Emperor's help, I won't be able to protect you forever. The only permanent solution is to capture those who would do you harm and then to raise you to your proper station.\"\n\"Do you believe my story?\" Gyna turned to Lady Brisienna.\n\"I have been the Emperor's chief agent in &lt;a href=\"High%20Rock\"&gt;High Rock&lt;/a&gt; for many years now, and I have heard few stranger tales. If your friend the ambassador hadn't investigated and discovered what he has, I would have dismissed you outright as a madwoman,\" Brisienna laughed, forcing a smile onto Gyna's face to match. \"But now, yes, I do believe you. Perhaps that makes me the madwoman.\"\n\"Will you help us?\" asked Lord Strale simply.\n\"It is a tricky business interfering in the affairs of the provincial kingdoms,\" Lady Brisienna looked into the depths of her mug thoughtfully. \"Unless there is a threat to the &lt;a href=\"Empire\"&gt;Empire&lt;/a&gt; itself, we find it is best not to meddle. What we have in your case is a very messy assassination that happened twenty years ago, and its aftermath. If His Imperial Majesty involved itself in every bloody hiccup in the succession in each of his thousand vassal kingdoms, he would never accomplish anything for the greater good of &lt;a href=\"Tamriel\"&gt;Tamriel&lt;/a&gt;.\"\n\"I understand,\" murmured Gyna. \"When I remembered everything, who I was and what happened to me, I resolved to do nothing about it. In fact, I was leaving Camlorn and going back home to Daggerfall when I saw Lord Strale again. He was the one who began this quest to resolve this, not me. And when he brought me back, I only wanted to see my cousin to tell her who I was, but he forbade me.\"\n\"It would have been too dangerous,\" growled Strale. \"We still don't know yet the depths of the conspiracy. Perhaps we never will.\"\n\"I'm sorry, I always find myself giving long explanations to short questions. When Lord Strale asked if I would help, I should have begun by saying 'yes,'\" Lady Brisienna laughed at the change in Lord Strale and Gyna's expressions. \"I will help you, of course. But for this to turn out well, you must accomplish two things to the Emperor's satisfaction. First, you must prove with absolute certainty who is the power behind this plot you've uncovered. You must get someone to confess.\"\n\"And secondly,\" said Lord Strale, nodding. \"We must prove that this is a matter worthy of His Imperial Majesty's consideration, and not merely a minor local concern.\"\nLord Strale, Lady &lt;a href=\"Brisienna\"&gt;Brisienna&lt;/a&gt;, and the woman who called herself Gyna discussed how to accomplish their goals for a few hours more. When it was agreed what had to be done, Lady Brisienna took her leave to find her ally &lt;a href=\"Proseccus\"&gt;Proseccus&lt;/a&gt;. Strale and Gyna set off to the west, toward Camlorn. It was not long after beginning their ride through the woods that they heard the sound of galloping hoof beats far up ahead. Lord Strale unsheathed his sword and signaled for Gyna to position her horse behind him.\nAt that moment, they were attacked on all sides. It was an ambush. Eight men, armed with axes, had been lying in wait.\nLord Strale quickly yanked Gyna from her horse, pulling her behind him. He made a brief, deft motion with his hands. A ring of flame materialized around them, and rushed outward, striking their assailants. The men roared in pain and dropped to their knees. Lord Strale jumped the horse over the closest one, and galloped at full speed westward.\n\"I thought you were an ambassador not a mage!\" laughed Gyna.\n\"I still believe there are times for diplomacy,\" replied Lord Strale.\nThe horse and rider they had heard before met them on the road. It was Gnorbooth. \"Milord, it's the royal battlemage! He found out you two were in &lt;a href=\"Umbington\"&gt;Umbington&lt;/a&gt;!\"\n\"With considerable ease, I might add,\" Lord Eryl's voice boomed out of the woods. Gnorbooth, Gyna, and Lord Strale scanned the dark trees, but they showed nothing. The battlemage's voice seemed to emanate from everywhere and nowhere.\n\"I'm sorry, milord,\" groaned Gnorbooth. \"I tried to warn you as soon as I could.\"\n\"In your next life, perhaps you'll remember not to trust your plans to a drunkard!\" laughed Lord Eryl. He had them in his sight, and the spell was unleashed.\nGnorbooth saw him first, by the light of the ball of fire that leapt from his fingertips. Later, Lord Eryl was to wonder to himself what the fool had intended to do. Perhaps he was rushing forward to pull Lord Strale out of the path. Perhaps he was trying to flee the path of destruction, and had simply moved left when he should have moved right. Perhaps, as unlikely as it seemed, he was willing to sacrifice himself to save his master. Whatever the reason, the result was the same.\nHe got in the way.\nThere was an explosion of energy that filled the night, and an echoing boom that shook birds from the trees for a mile around. On the few square feet where Gnorbooth and his horse had stood was nothing but black glass. They had been reduced to less than vapor. Gyna and Lord Strale were thrown back. Their horse, when it recovered its senses, galloped away as fast as it could. In the lingering glowing aura of the spell's detonation, Lord Strale looked straight into the woods and into the wide eyes of the battlemage.\n\"Damn,\" said Lord Eryl and began to run. The ambassador jumped to his feet and pursued.\n\"That was an expensive use of magicka, even for you,\" said Lord Strale as he ran. \"Don't you know well enough not to use ranged spells unless you are certain your target won't be blocked?\"\n\"I never thought - that idiot -\" Lord Eryl was struck from behind and knocked to the wet forest floor before he had a chance to finish his lamentation.\n\"It doesn't matter what you thought,\" said Lord Strale calmly, flipping the battlemage around and pinning his arms to the ground with his knees. \"I'm not a battlemage, but I knew enough not to use my entire reserve on your little ambush. Perhaps it's a matter of philosophy, as a government agent, I feel inclined toward conservatism.\"\n\"What are you going to do?\" whimpered Lord Eryl.\n\"Gnorbooth was a good man, one of the best, and so I'm going to hurt you quite a lot,\" the ambassador made a slight movement and his hands began to glow brightly. \"That's a certainty. How much more I'm going to hurt you after that depends on what you tell me. I want to hear about the former Duke of &lt;a href=\"Oloine\"&gt;Oloine&lt;/a&gt;.\"\n\"What do you want to know?\" Lord Eryl screamed.\n\"Let's start with everything,\" replied Lord Strale with perfect patience."}

She was an apt pupil, and within days, he had taught what she needed to know.\n\"It is a simple &lt;a href=\"Charm%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;charm&lt;/a&gt;, not the sort of spell that could turn a raging &lt;a href=\"daedroth\"&gt;daedroth&lt;/a&gt; into a love-struck puppy,\" said Proseccus. \"If you do or say anything that would normally anger or offend your target, the power will weaken. It will alter temporarily his perception of you, as spells of the &lt;a href=\"Illusion\"&gt;school of illusion&lt;/a&gt; do, but his feelings of respect and admiration for you must be supported by means of a charm of a less magickal nature.\"\n\"I understand,\" smiled Gyna, thanking her tutor for the two spells of illusion he had taught her. The time had come to use her new-found skill.\nThe Prostitutes Guildhouse of Camlorn was a great palace in an affluent northern quarter of the city. Prince Sylon could have found his way there blindfolded, or blind drunk as he often was. Tonight, however, he was only lightly inebriated and he resolved to drink no more. Tonight he was in the mood for pleasure. His kind of pleasure.\n\"Where is my favorite, Grigia?\" he demanded of the Guildmistress upon entering.\n\"She is still healing from your appointment with her last week,\" she smiled serenely. \"Most of the other women are in with clients as well, but I saved a special treat for you. A new girl. One you will certainly enjoy.\"\nThe Prince was guided to a sumptuously decorated suite of velvet and silk. As he entered, Gyna stepped from behind a screen and cast her spell quickly, with her mind open to belief as Proseccus had instructed. It was hard to tell if it worked at first. The Prince looked at her with a cruel smile and then, like sun breaking through clouds, the cruelty left. She could tell he was hers. He asked her her name.\n\"I am between names right now,\" she teased. \"I've never made love to a real prince before. I've never even been inside a palace. Is yours very ... big?\"\n\"It's not mine yet,\" he shrugged. \"But someday I'll be king.\"\n\"It would be wonderful to live in such a place,\" Gyna cooed. \"A thousand years of history. Everything must be so old and beautiful. The paintings and books and statues and tapestries. Does your family hold onto all their old treasures?\"\n\"Yes, hoarded away with a lot of boring old junk in the archive rooms in the vaults. Please, may I see you naked now?\"\n\"First a little conversation, though you may feel free to disrobe whenever you like,\" said Gyna. \"I had heard there was an archive room, but it's quite hidden away.\"\n\"There's a false wall behind the family crypt,\" said the Prince, gripping her wrist and pulling her towards him for a kiss. Something in his eyes had changed.\n\"Your Highness, you're hurting my arm,\" Gyna cried.\n\"Enough talk, you bewitching whore,\" he snarled. Holding back a sharp jab of fear, Gyna let her mind cool and perceptions whirl. As his angry mouth touched her lips, she cast the second spell she had learned her illusionist mentor.\nThe Prince felt his flesh turn to stone. He remained frozen, watching Gyna pull together her clothing and leave the room. The paralysis would only last for a few more minutes, but it was all the time she needed.\nThe Guildmistress had already left with all her girls, just as Gyna and Lord Strale had told her to. They would tell her when it was safe to return. She had not even accepted any gold for her part in the trap. She said it was enough that her girls would not be tortured anymore by that most perverse and cruel Prince.\n\"What a terrible boy,\" thought Gyna as she raised the hood on her cloak and raced through the streets toward Lord Strale's house. \"It is good that he will never be king.\"\nThe following morning, the King and Queen of &lt;a href=\"Camlorn\"&gt;Camlorn&lt;/a&gt; held their daily audience with various nobles and diplomats, a sparse gathering. The throne room was largely empty. It was a terribly dull way to begin the day. In between petitions, they yawned regally.\n\"What has happened to all the interesting people?\" the Queen murmured. \"Where's our precious boy?\"\n\"I've heard he was raging through the north quarter in search of some harlot who robbed him,\" the King chuckled fondly. \"What a fine lad.\"\n\"And what of the Royal &lt;a href=\"Battlemage\"&gt;Battlemage&lt;/a&gt;?\"\n\"I've sent him to take care of a delicate matter,\" the King knit his brow. \"But that was nearly a week ago, and I haven't heard one word from him. It's somewhat troubling.\"\n\"Indeed it is, Lord Eryl should not be gone so long,\" the Queen frowned. \"What if a rogue sorcerer came and threatened us? Husband, don't laugh at me, that is why all the royal houses of &lt;a href=\"High%20Rock\"&gt;High Rock&lt;/a&gt; keep their mage retainers close to their side. To protect their court from evil enchantments, like the one that our poor Emperor suffered so recently.\"\n\"At the hand of his own battlemage,\" chuckled the King\n\"Lord Eryl would never betray you like that, and you well know it. He has been in your employ since you were Duke of &lt;a href=\"Oloine\"&gt;Oloine&lt;/a&gt;. To even make that comparison between he and &lt;a href=\"Jagar%20Tharn\"&gt;Jagar Tharn&lt;/a&gt;, really,\" the Queen waved her hands dismissively. \"It is that sort of lack of trust that is ruining kingdoms all over &lt;a href=\"Tamriel\"&gt;Tamriel&lt;/a&gt;. Now, Lord Strale tells me -\"\n\"There's another man that's gone missing,\" mused the King.\n\"The ambassador?\" the Queen shook her head. \"No, he's here. He was desirous to visit the crypts and pay homage to your noble ancestors, so I directed him there. I can't think what's keeping him so long. He must be more pious than I thought.\"\nShe was surprised to see the King rise up, alarmed. \"Why didn't you tell me?\"\nBefore she had a chance to reply, the subject of their conversation was coming through the open door to the throne room. At on his arm was a beautiful fair-haired woman in a stately gown of scarlet and gold, worthy of the highest nobility. The queen followed her startled husband's gaze, and was likewise amazed.\n\"I had heard he was taken with one of the harlots from the &lt;a href=\"Flower%20Festival\"&gt;Flower Festival&lt;/a&gt;, not a lady,\" she whispered. \"Why, she looks remarkably like your daughter, the Lady Jyllia.\"\n\"That she does,\" the King gasped. \"Or her cousin, the &lt;a href=\"Princess%20Talara\"&gt;Princess Talara&lt;/a&gt;.\"\nThe nobles in the room also whispered amongst themselves. Though few had been at court twenty years ago when the Princess had disappeared, presumed murdered like the rest of the royal family, there were still a few elder statesmen who remembered. It was not only on throne that the word \"Talara\" passed through the air like an enchantment.\n\"Lord Strale, will you introduce us to your lady?\" the Queen asked with a polite smile.\n\"In a moment, your highness, but I'm afraid I must first discuss pressing matters,\" Lord Strale replied with a bow. \"Might I request a private audience?\"\nThe King looked at the &lt;a href=\"Imperial\"&gt;Imperial&lt;/a&gt; ambassador, trying to read into the man's expression. With a wave of his hand, he dismissed the assembled and had the doors shut behind them. No one remained in the audience room but the King, the Queen, the ambassador, a dozen royal guards, and the mysterious woman.\nThe ambassador pulled from his pocket a sheaf of old yellowed parchment. \"Your Highness, when you ascended the throne after your brother and his family were murdered, anything that seemed important, deeds and wills, were of course kept with the clerks and ministers. His entire incidental, unimportant personal correspondence was sent to archive which is standard protocol. This letter was among them.\"\n\"What is this all about, sir?\" the King boomed. \"What does it say?\"\n\"Nothing about you, your majesty. In truth, at the time of your majesty's ascension, no one reading it could have understood its significance. It was a letter to the Emperor the late king your brother was penning at the time of his assassination, concerning a thief who had once been a mage-priest at the Temple of &lt;a href=\"Sethiete\"&gt;Sethiete&lt;/a&gt; here in &lt;a href=\"Camlorn\"&gt;Camlorn&lt;/a&gt;. His name was Jagar Tharn.\"\n\"Jagar Tharn?\" the Queen laughed nervously. \"Why, we were just talking about him.\"\n\"Tharn had stolen many books of powerful and forgotten spells, and lore about such artifacts as the &lt;a href=\"Staff%20of%20Chaos\"&gt;Staff of Chaos&lt;/a&gt;, where it was hidden and how it could be used. News travels slowly to westernmost High Rock, and by the time the King your brother had heard that the Emperor's new battlemage was a man named Jagar Tharn, many years had passed. The king had been writing a letter to warn the Emperor of the treachery of his Imperial &lt;a href=\"Battlemage\"&gt;Battlemage&lt;/a&gt;, but it was never completed.\" Lord Strale held up the letter. \"It is dated on the day of his assassination in the year &lt;a href=\"3E%20385\"&gt;385&lt;/a&gt;. Four years before Jagar Tharn betrayed his master, and began the ten years of tyranny of the &lt;a href=\"Imperial%20Simulacrum\"&gt;Imperial Simulacrum&lt;/a&gt;.\"\n\"This is all very interesting,\" the King barked. \"But what has it to do with me?\"\n\"The late King's assassination is now a matter of Imperial concern. And I have a confession from your Royal Battlemage Lord Eryl.\"\nThe King's face lost all color: \"You miserable worm, no man may threaten me. Neither you, nor that whore, nor that letter will ever see the light of day again. Guards!\"\nThe royal guards unsheathed their blades and pressed forward. As they did so, there was a sudden shimmering of light and the room was filled with Imperial nightblades, led by Proseccus. They had been there for hours, lurking invisibly in the shadows.\n\"In the name of His Imperial Majesty, &lt;a href=\"Uriel%20Septim%20VII\"&gt;Uriel Septim VII&lt;/a&gt;, I arrest you,\" said Strale.\nThe doors were opened, and the King and Queen were led out, heads bowed. Gyna told Proseccus where he would most likely find their son, Prince Sylon. The courtiers and nobles who had been in the audience chamber stared at the strange, solemn procession of their King and Queen to their own royal prison. No one said a word.\nWhen at last a voice was heard, it startled all. The Lady Jyllia had arrived at court. \"What is happening? Who dares to usurp the authority of the King and Queen?\"\nLord Strale turned to Proseccus: \"We would speak with the Lady Jyllia alone. You know what needs to be done.\"\nProseccus nodded and had the doors to the throne room closed once again. The courtiers pressed against the wood, straining to hear everything. Though they could not say it, they wanted an explanation almost as much as her Ladyship did."}

Quietly, she sat down at the foot of the throne in the now empty audience chamber.\nThis young lady came to me, having completely recovered her memory, but the story she told was beyond incredible, I simply couldn't believe it,\" said Lord Strale. \"But she was so convinced of it, I had to investigate. So I talked to everyone who was here at the palace twenty years ago to see if there could be any truth to it. Of course, at the time of the King and Queen's murder, and the &lt;a href=\"Princess%20Talara\"&gt;Princess's&lt;/a&gt; disappearance, there was a full inquiry made, but I had different questions to ask this time. Questions about the relationship between the two little cousins, Lady Jyllia Raze and the Princess.\nI've told everyone over and over again, I don't remember anything at all about that time in my life,\" said Jyllia, tears welling up.\nI know you don't. There has never been a question in my mind that you witnessed a horrible murder, and that your memory lapse and hers,\" said Lord Strale, gesturing toward Gyna \"Are both very real. The story I heard from the servants and other people at the palace was that the little girls were inseparably close. There were no other playmates, and as the Princess's place was to be close to her parents, so the little Lady Jyllia was always there as well. When the assassin came to murder the Royal Family, the King and Queen were in their bedroom, and the girls were playing in the throne room.\"\n\"When my memory came back to me, it was like opening a sealed box,\" said Gyna solemnly. \"Everything was so clear and detailed, like it all happened yesterday not twenty years ago. I was on the throne, playing Empress, and you were hiding behind the dais, pretending you were in a dungeon I had sent you to. A man I had never seen burst into the room from the Royal bedchamber, his blade soaked in blood. He came at me, and I ran for my life. I remember starting to run for the dais, but I saw your face, frozen in fear, and I didn't want to lead him to you. So I ran for the window.\nWe had climbed on the outside of the castle before, just for fun, that was one of the first memories that came back to me when I was holding onto that cliff. You and I on the castle wall, and the King calling up to me, telling me how to get down. But that day, I couldn't hold on, I was trembling so much. I just fell, and landed in the river.\nI don't know if it was entirely the horror of what I had seen, or that combined with the impact of the fall and the coldness of the water, but everything just went blank in my mind. When I finally pulled myself out of the river, many miles away, I had no idea who I was. And so it stayed,\" Gyna smiled. \"Until now.\nSo you are the Princess Talara?\" cried Jyllia.\nLet me explain further before she answers that, because the simple answer would just confuse you, as it did me,\" said Lord Strale. \"The assassin was caught before he managed to escape the palace - in truth, he had to know he was going to be caught. He confessed immediately to the murders of the Royal Family. The Princess, he said, he had thrown out the window to her death. A servant down below heard the scream, and saw something fly past his window, so he knew it to be true.\nIt was not for several hours that little Lady Jyllia was found by her nursemaid &lt;a href=\"Ramke\"&gt;Ramke&lt;/a&gt; hiding behind the dais, coated with dust, shivering with fear, and unable to speak at all. Ramke was very protective of you,\" Strale said, nodding to Jyllia. \"She insisted on putting you to your room right away, and sent word the Duke of Oloine that the Royal Family was dead, and that his daughter had witnessed the murders but survived.\nI'm beginning to remember a little of that,\" said Jyllia, wonderingly. \"I remember lying in bed, with Ramke comforting me. I was so muddled and I couldn't concentrate. I remember I just wanted it all to be play time still, I don't know why. And then, I remember being bundled up and taken to that asylum.\nIt'll all come back to you soon,\" Gyna smiled. \"I promise. That's how I began to remember. I just caught one detail, and the whole flood began.\nThat's it,\" Jyllia began to sob in frustration. \"I don't remember anything else except confusion. No, I also remember Daddy not even looking at me as I was taken away. And I remember not caring about that, or anything else.\nIt was a confusing time for all, so particularly so for little girls. Especially little girls who went through what you two did,\" said Lord Strale sympathetically. \"From what I understand, as soon as he received the message from Ramke, the Duke left his palace at &lt;a href=\"Oloine\"&gt;Oloine&lt;/a&gt;, gave orders for you to be sent to a private sanitarium until you'd recovered from your ordeal, and set to work with his private guard torturing the assassin for information. When I heard that, that no one but the Duke and his personal guard saw the assassin after he gave his initial confession, and that no one was present but the Duke and his guards when the assassin was killed trying to escape, I thought that very significant.\nI spoke with Lord &lt;a href=\"Eryl\"&gt;Eryl&lt;/a&gt;, who I knew was one of those present, and I had to bluff him, pretending I had more evidence than I did. I got the reaction I was hoping for, though it was a dangerous gambit. At last he confessed to what I already knew to be true.\nThe assassin,\" Lord Strale paused, and reluctantly met Jyllia's eyes, \"Had been hired by the Duke of Oloine to kill the Royal Family, including the Princess as heir, so that the crown might be passed to him and to his children.\nJyllia stared at Lord Strale, aghast. \"My father -\nThe assassin had been told that once the Duke had him in custody, he would be paid and a prison break would be arranged. The thug picked the wrong time to be greedy and try to get more gold. The Duke decided that it would be cheaper to silence him, so he murdered him then and there, so the man would never tell anyone what really happened,\" Lord Strale shrugged. \"No tragic loss as far as murders go. In a few years' time, you returned from the sanitarium, a little shaken but back to normal, except for a complete absence of memory about your childhood. And in that time, the former Duke of Oloine had taken his brother's place as the King of &lt;a href=\"Camlorn\"&gt;Camlorn&lt;/a&gt;. It was no small maneuver.\nNo,\" said Jyllia, quietly. \"He must have been very busy. He remarried and had another child. No one ever came to visit me in the sanitarium but Ramke.\nIf he had visited and seen you,\" said Gyna. \"This story might have turned out very differently.\nWhat do you mean?\" asked Jyllia.\nThis is the most amazing part,\" said Lord Strale. \"The question has long been whether Gyna is the Princess Talara. When her memory returned, and she told me what she remembered, I put several pieces of evidence together. Consider these facts.\nThe two of you look remarkably alike now after twenty years of living very different lives, and as little girls and constant playmates, you looked nearly identical.\nAt the time of the assassination, the murderer who had never been there before, only saw one girl on the throne, who he assumed to be his quarry.\n\"The woman who found Lady Jyllia was her nursemaid Ramke, a creature of unstable mind and fanatical devotion to her charge - the type would never accept the possibility that her beloved little girl had been the one who disappeared. The nursemaid was the only single person who knew both Princess Talara and the Lady Jyllia who visited you while you were in the sanitarium.\n\"Finally,\" said Lord Strale, \"Consider the fact that when you returned to court from the sanitarium, five years had past, and you had grown from a child to a young lady. You looked familiar, but not quite the same as your family remembered you, which is only natural.\"\n\"I don't understand,\" cried the poor girl, her eyes wide, because she did understand. Here memory was falling together like a terrible flood.\nLet me explain it like this,\" said her cousin, wrapping her in her arms. \"I know who I am now. My real name is Jyllia Raze. That man who was arrested was my father, the man who murdered the King - your father. YOU are the Princess &lt;a href=\"Talara\"&gt;Talara&lt;/a&gt;."}

The &lt;a href=\"chub%20loon\"&gt;chub loon&lt;/a&gt; has no purpose and little known history. However, it is delicious when cooked with moon-sugar glaze and citrus.\nI, Zabia-ko, and several companions sought to secure trade with the &lt;a href=\"Orsimer%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Orcs&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"Fharun%20Stronghold\"&gt;Fharun Stronghold&lt;/a&gt; when we found ourselves on the wrong side of the negotiations. We had little choice but to run for our lives when the chief burned our ship and sent warriors after us. The cold and rocky coast overlooking the frigid &lt;a href=\"Sea%20of%20Ghosts\"&gt;Sea of Ghosts&lt;/a&gt; became our home for the night. The howling sea wind bit deep into our fur. Despite that, sleep eventually came in the dark of the night.\nAs the sun rose over the &lt;a href=\"Druadach%20Mountains\"&gt;Druadach Mountains&lt;/a&gt;, a cacophony of honking sounds broke the rhythmic peace of the waves against the rocks. The others feared some unknown beast had come to eat us, but curiosity overcame this one, and she slipped out of her bedroll, grabbed her staff, and moved toward the coast to let her eyes decide if we should stay or flee. Of all the creatures that passed before Zabia-ko's eyes, none are stranger than the stub-legged, waddling birds, that swarmed the ice floes and rocks. They stood in groups, clumping for warmth, with their useless wings clapping at their sides. Their call, once frightening, sounded comical when I looked upon them.\nThe birds were nothing like anything in the old and well-known wilderness guide I borrowed from the library back home. Escape through the &lt;a href=\"Friendship%20Gate\"&gt;Friendship Gate&lt;/a&gt; could wait. This was something new, and new things have value. At first we were very careful to gather a few of the creatures, but we soon learned that they were too stupid to flee from a &lt;a href=\"Khajiit%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Khajiit&lt;/a&gt;. They had no trouble fleeing from Orcs, though! Any proper prey should try to run away when Khajiit walk among them, but not these flightless birds. We scooped them up and made haste for the gate, lest the Fharun clan catch our scent and give chase.\nThis one's first stop in &lt;a href=\"Wayrest%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Wayrest&lt;/a&gt; was to the &lt;a href=\"Wayrest%20Mages%20Guild\"&gt;Mages Guild&lt;/a&gt;. A few pieces of gold gained me access to their natural history library, where a new edition of the wilderness guide was prominently displayed. It mentions the chub loon as an elusive creature that was not observed by earlier writers. How could such an obnoxious creature be overlooked?\nThis one spent several days and candle-lit nights going over every tome on the creatures and wildlife of &lt;a href=\"Tamriel\"&gt;Tamriel&lt;/a&gt;. Not a single mention of the chub loon exists before the beginning of the second era. How could that be? The very first mention is in a text on the &lt;a href=\"Horker%20%28Online%29\"&gt;horker&lt;/a&gt;, and it only says that they were moving in on the horker habitat, disrupting the food source. Could it be that, like the &lt;a href=\"Nords%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Nords&lt;/a&gt; and other men, they came from another land? Could the stupid birds have been brought from &lt;a href=\"Atmora\"&gt;Atmora&lt;/a&gt;? Could they have traversed the Sea of Ghosts on their own with only floating chunks of ice to carry them? In any case, no matter how they arrived, they secured a new habitat, flourishing on &lt;a href=\"Wrothgar%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Wrothgar&lt;/a&gt;'s rocky coast."}

After dealing with that prompt, this quest can be obtained by selecting \"duties.\" \nDespite this, this quest cannot be completed in these circumstances if they are following the &lt;a href=\"Arch-Mage%20%28Quest%29%23Duel%20to%20the%20Death\"&gt;Duel to the Death&lt;/a&gt; path of the Arch-Mage quest. Once the Nerevarine leaves the &lt;a href=\"Vivec%20City%20%28Morrowind%29\"&gt;Vivec&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Mages%20Guild%20%28Morrowind%29\"&gt;Guildhall&lt;/a&gt; and returns, all of Trebonius' dialog prompts are removed and replaced with a message saying \"Meet me in the Arena.\" and a \"Goodbye\" response that closes the dialog window. This quest will remain stuck in the journal from then onwards. If the \"Peacefully\" path is chosen, then Trebonius is alive after the promotion and this quest can be turned in normally.\nWalkthrough.\nUpon talking to &lt;a href=\"Trebonius%20Artorius\"&gt;Trebonius Artorius&lt;/a&gt; for &lt;a href=\"Mages%20Guild%20%28Morrowind%29\"&gt;Mages Guild&lt;/a&gt; quests, he will tell the Nerevarine to find out what happened to the dwarves. He probably did not expect them to actually succeed at this, as it seems an impossible task, but it is possible to do it if the Nerevarine picks up the right items in other Mages Guild quests.\nThe Nerevarine will need to find three books, which can all be found while doing quests for &lt;a href=\"Edwinna%20Elbert\"&gt;Edwinna Elbert&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe first book is called \"&lt;a href=\"Hanging%20Gardens\"&gt;Hanging Gardens&lt;/a&gt;\". It is found on a desk in the lower levels of &lt;a href=\"Nchuleftingth%20%28Morrowind%29\"&gt;Nchuleftingth&lt;/a&gt;, which is accessed during the quest \"&lt;a href=\"Nchuleftingth%20Expedition\"&gt;Nchuleftingth Expedition&lt;/a&gt;.\"\nThe second book is \"&lt;a href=\"Divine%20Metaphysics\"&gt;Divine Metaphysics&lt;/a&gt;\", which is located in &lt;a href=\"Bethamez%20%28Location%29\"&gt;Bethamez&lt;/a&gt;. It is on a table next to the entrence, along with the &lt;a href=\"Dwemer%20Airship%20Plans\"&gt;Dwemer Airship Plans&lt;/a&gt;. Bethamez can be accessed through the &lt;a href=\"Gnisis%20Eggmine%20%28Location%29\"&gt;Gnisis Eggmine&lt;/a&gt;. It is part of the quest \"&lt;a href=\"Bethamez%20%28Quest%29\"&gt;Bethamez&lt;/a&gt;.\"\nThe final book is \"&lt;a href=\"The%20Egg%20of%20Time\"&gt;The Egg of Time&lt;/a&gt;\". It is located in &lt;a href=\"Mzuleft\"&gt;Mzuleft&lt;/a&gt;, which is accessed in the quest \"&lt;a href=\"Scarab%20Plans%20in%20Mzuleft\"&gt;Scarab Plans in Mzuleft&lt;/a&gt;.\"\nUpon showing any of these books to Edwinna Elbert, she will tell the Nerevarine that she is unable to read &lt;a href=\"Dwemeris\"&gt;Dwemeris&lt;/a&gt;, and that they should seek out &lt;a href=\"Hasphat%20Antabolis\"&gt;Hasphat Antabolis&lt;/a&gt; in the Balmora Fighters Guild. However, Hasphat is also unable to help, though he will inform the Nerevarine that there might be wizards among the &lt;a href=\"House%20Telvanni%20%28Morrowind%29\"&gt;Telvanni&lt;/a&gt; who are capable of deciphering the text. However, he will not refer them to a specific Telvanni.\nThe Telvanni he is talking about is &lt;a href=\"Baladas%20Demnevanni%20%28Character%29\"&gt;Baladas Demnevanni&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Gnisis%20%28Morrowind%29\"&gt;Gnisis&lt;/a&gt;. Upon being shown all three of the books, Baladas will translate them, giving them the information Trebonius requested.\nAlternatively, the Nerevarine may take the books to &lt;a href=\"Yagrum%20Bagarn%20%28Morrowind%29\"&gt;Yagrum Bagarn&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;a href=\"Corprusarium\"&gt;Corprusarium&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Tel%20Fyr%20%28Morrowind%29\"&gt;Tel Fyr&lt;/a&gt;. Yagrum Bagarn will only require \"Divine Metaphysics\" and \"The Egg of Time\", so if the Nerevarine missed out on \"Hanging Gardens\", this is the way to go.\nUpon returning to Trebonius, he will congratulate the Nerevarine for completing a task he thought was impossible."}

I can't begin to describe the kinship I feel with those lights as they waltz across the night in harmonious movements.\nThe desert provides a harsh existence. Food and water are hard to come by, and many times I have relied on the good fortune of a traveling merchant or another traveler, joining me by my campside and trading some meager portion of food in exchange for a word of wisdom or a story.\nBut I find that as my body grows lean and strong, my vision becomes clear. Every piece of me that is not necessary, that chains me to this too-solid form, slips away. I slough it off, like a serpent shedding its skin.\nIn this state, I have seen many wonders and undergone many temptations. I have ridden astride a coursing steed into battle alongside &lt;a href=\"The%20Warrior\"&gt;The Warrior&lt;/a&gt; at his apex. I have seen &lt;a href=\"The%20Mage\"&gt;The Mage&lt;/a&gt; take her many forms, shifting from beautiful &lt;a href=\"mer\"&gt;Elven&lt;/a&gt; woman to bearded old man and back again. Late at night, she whispers to me the secrets of the Principle of Change, which is pure &lt;a href=\"magic\"&gt;magic&lt;/a&gt;. And on many restless nights I have chased &lt;a href=\"The%20Thief%20%28Online%29\"&gt;the thief&lt;/a&gt;, who, fleet of foot, remains just out of grasp, always escaping into the pale light of the dawn just as I think myself victorious. I have seen each of &lt;a href=\"Guardian%20Stones\"&gt;the guardians&lt;/a&gt; in turn and found them beautiful and terrible to behold.\nBut through it all there has been a presence, unsettling and powerful. A distant enemy who wants to blot the stars from the sky and render the world in bloodshed and chaos. I have felt his presence when, pushed to the edge of madness by hunger or thirst, I considered taking the life of a lone traveler so that I might eat. Almost nightly, he tempts me with dreams of glory\u2014dreams of plucking the stars from the sky and returning to the civilized lands of &lt;a href=\"Tamriel\"&gt;Tamriel&lt;/a&gt; as a god.\nOf all my night visitors, it is this one who seems to me to be most like myself. And for this reason, I fear him more than all the others."}

Casting it exhausts &lt;a href=\"Magicka%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;Magicka&lt;/a&gt;.\nClasses and races.\nClasses.\n&lt;a href=\"Classes%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;Classes&lt;/a&gt; utilizing the Mysticism skill:\nRaces.\n&lt;a href=\"Races%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;Races&lt;/a&gt; granted boosts to Mysticism:\nLeveling text.\nApprentice.\n\"The mysteries of magic are slowly revealing themselves to you.

Players that like to recharge their &lt;a href=\"magic\"&gt;magic&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Weapons%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;weapons&lt;/a&gt; often will find &lt;a href=\"Soul%20Trap%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;Soul Trap&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Spells%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;spells&lt;/a&gt; useful as well. Reflect spells and Absorb spells are not very useful because they only go to 20% even at very high levels. Mysticism helps raise Intelligence which in turn helps raise total Magicka."}

Despite repeated proofs that no viable Thieves Guild exists, the rumors persist. Whenever historians search for evidence of this shadowy organization, nothing is found. Witnesses know nothing. Safe houses are empty. Fences turn out to be simple businessmen.\nLet me clarify by stating that thieves most certainly do exist. They rot in dungeons all across &lt;a href=\"Tamriel\"&gt;Tamriel&lt;/a&gt;. Certainly bands of thieves work together to commit crimes. On rare occasions there has even been documented cases where persistent bands of thieves have worked together for years at a time committing thefts and other crimes.\nHowever, a guild is different than a band. A guild implies an organization with membership rolls. It would have a financial structure, which would include member dues or some other means of securing funds. It would have rules of conduct or behavior. It would have a hierarchical leadership structure. Within this structure there would be methods of advancement and succession.\nThe best documented case of a Thieves Guild was found in Morrowind. For a brief time Gentleman Jim Stacey ran a ring of thieved that robbed wealthy merchants and nobles all across that island nation. During the recent incident, the &lt;a href=\"Fighters%20Guild%20%28Morrowind%29\"&gt;Fighters Guild&lt;/a&gt; and the shadowy &lt;a href=\"Morag%20Tong%20%28Morrowind%29\"&gt;Morag Tong&lt;/a&gt; eliminated this band of thugs. The final fate of &lt;a href=\"Gentleman%20Jim%20Stacey%20%28Morrowind%29\"&gt;Gentleman Jim Stacey&lt;/a&gt; himself is not known.\nThe Morrowind Thieves Guild did have a financial structure and a leadership structure. It satisfied many of the conditions of a true guild. However, it was short lived. Public knowledge of Stacey's group lasted for only a few years at most. Although the Fighters Guild has claimed credit for wiping them out, some historians believe the group merely went deeper undercover.\nThe problem with determining the non-existence of the Thieves Guild is quite logical. It is not possible to prove a negative. I cannot prove definitively that the Thieves Guild does not exist, only that historians have been unable to document one.\nIf a Thieves Guild were to be operational in &lt;a href=\"Cyrodiil\"&gt;Cyrodiil&lt;/a&gt;, one would think that crime would be rampant, which it is not. The very nature of thieves makes it impossible for them to trust one another sufficiently to work together for very long. By nature a thief is a rule breaker. Therefore an organization that has rules would fail if all members were thieves. For these reasons, I dispute the existence of a modern day Thieves Guild in Cyrodiil."}

{"id": "1452", "revid": "48527480", "url": "https://elderscrolls.fandom.com/wiki?curid=1452", "title": "Mythic Dawn", "text": "The Order of the Mythic Dawn, also known as just the Mythic Dawn, was a group of &lt;a href=\"Daedra\"&gt;Daedra&lt;/a&gt; worshippers dedicated to the Lord &lt;a href=\"Mehrunes%20Dagon\"&gt;Mehrunes Dagon&lt;/a&gt;. They followed the teachings of &lt;a href=\"Mankar%20Camoran\"&gt;Mankar Camoran&lt;/a&gt;, who they called the Master. Their holy book was the &lt;a href=\"Mysterium%20Xarxes\"&gt;Mysterium Xarxes&lt;/a&gt;, a book which may only be read or touched by Mankar Camoran.\nInitiation.\nIn order to become a member of the Mythic Dawn, one would first have to obtain each of the four &lt;a href=\"Commentaries%20on%20the%20Mysterium%20Xarxes\"&gt;Commentaries on the Mysterium Xarxes&lt;/a&gt;. The first two volumes are rare, while the Third and Fourth volume are considered impossible to obtain. The first test to show one is worthy of joining the cult is through finding their hidden sanctuary by reading the books. The Third copy, while rare, could still be obtained through special orders, while the Fourth copy could only be obtained directly from a member of the Mythic Dawn. The ones to provide the Fourth copy to a new initiate are known as \"Sponsors\", and before the book is given, one must be deemed worthy by their Sponsor. After obtaining each of the four books, a new initiate has to find the hidden message within the book. Through combining the first letter of every paragraph in the books, the hidden message is made clear: \"Green Emperor Way Where Tower Touches Midday Sun\". At the Green Emperor Way, the &lt;a href=\"Tomb%20of%20Prince%20Camarril\"&gt;Tomb of Prince Camarril&lt;/a&gt; would reflect a map of &lt;a href=\"Cyrodiil\"&gt;Cyrodiil&lt;/a&gt; at 12:00, showing the location of the &lt;a href=\"Dagon%20Shrine\"&gt;Dagon Shrine&lt;/a&gt;.\nUpon arrival the Shrine, one is greeted by a doorkeeper saying \"Dawn is breaking\". By answering \"Greet the new day\", the first test is completed. Afterwards, the initiate is met by a recruiter. By this point, refusal to join results in being attacked by the members of the cult. To fully complete the process of joining the Mythic Dawn, one has to sacrifice an enemy of Lord Dagon; a priest. Upon doing so, the initiate has officially joined the cult, and becomes an &lt;a href=\"Mythic%20Dawn%20Acolyte\"&gt;Mythic Dawn Acolyte&lt;/a&gt;.\nTheology.\nThe Mythic Dawn sees &lt;a href=\"Lorkhan\"&gt;Lorkhan&lt;/a&gt; as another Daedric Prince, and see Tamriel as his Princedom. As such, they support Mehrunes Dagon's attempt at reclaiming the land, which they consider occupied. Mehrunes Dagon is seen as a liberator, and the Mythic Dawn use the weakness of the Aedra, and the power of the Daedric Lords, as evidence to support their claims. They see the Divines as traitors who murdered Lorkhan, while seeing the Daedra as the true gods of Tamriel. As further support of this claim, it is pointed out how Tamriel has always been a contested ground, a land of Change. Fitting for a Daedric Lord.\nFollowers of the Mythic Dawn who have arrived in Paradise give their soul to the &lt;a href=\"Magna%20Ge\"&gt;Magna Ge&lt;/a&gt;, as the Magna Ge created Mehrunes the Razor in &lt;a href=\"Lyg\"&gt;Lyg&lt;/a&gt;. These followers acknowledge that the Magna Ge are all diverse, yet shared one purpose, to create one asset: hope.\nHistory.\n&lt;a href=\"Third%20Era\"&gt;Third Era&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe Mythic Dawn cult would find its origins in the early Third Era. The size of the cult at this time is unknown, but it is known that Mankar Camoran wrote his Commentaries on the Mysterium Xarxes when &lt;a href=\"Tiber%20Septim\"&gt;Tiber Septim&lt;/a&gt; was alive, in &lt;a href=\"3E%2033\"&gt;3E 33&lt;/a&gt;, 400 years before the &lt;a href=\"Oblivion%20Crisis\"&gt;Oblivion Crisis&lt;/a&gt; would take place. Other sources imply Mankar was born around the time of the &lt;a href=\"Camoran%20Usurper\"&gt;Camoran Usurper&lt;/a&gt;, which would make the cult far younger.\nIn the late Third-Era, the Mythic Dawn sent assassins to murder Emperor &lt;a href=\"Uriel%20Septim%20VII\"&gt;Uriel Septim VII&lt;/a&gt; and his heirs, &lt;a href=\"Geldall%20Septim\"&gt;Geldall&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Ebel%20Septim\"&gt;Ebel&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Enman%20Septim\"&gt;Enman Septim&lt;/a&gt;. Attacks on the Emperor's sons would take place before the attempt on his own life, though all four targets would be eliminated. Not long afterwards one of the chief lieutenants of the Mythic Dawn, by the name of &lt;a href=\"Eldamil\"&gt;Eldamil&lt;/a&gt;, who had also played a role in planning the assassination of the Emperor and his heirs, would open a &lt;a href=\"Great%20Gate\"&gt;Great Gate&lt;/a&gt; at &lt;a href=\"Kvatch\"&gt;Kvatch&lt;/a&gt; in order to kill the bastard son of Uriel Septim VII, known as &lt;a href=\"Martin%20Septim\"&gt;Martin Septim&lt;/a&gt;. The Mythic Dawn and their Daedric allies overran the town with ease, and sacked it. The Daedra used during the assault were those of the Ganonah clan.\nWith the death of Emperor Uriel, a prisoner was given the &lt;a href=\"Amulet%20of%20Kings\"&gt;Amulet of Kings&lt;/a&gt;, and would bring the artifact to &lt;a href=\"Jauffre%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;Jauffre&lt;/a&gt;, the grandmaster of the Blades. Jauffre knew of Martin's existence and feared he may be in danger, so the prisoner was sent to Kvatch to escort the bastard son to &lt;a href=\"Weynon%20Priory\"&gt;Weynon Priory&lt;/a&gt;. Upon arrival at Kvatch the city was already in ruins, and the prisoner would have to play a role in shutting down the &lt;a href=\"Oblivion%20Gate\"&gt;Oblivion Gate&lt;/a&gt; outside the walls before Martin would agree to come with them to the Priory. While on their way back, the Mythic Dawn had organized an attack on the Priory, and in the confusion, the Amulet of Kings had been stolen from the Blades. Recognising the risk of remaining at the Priory, Grandmaster Jauffre brought Martin to &lt;a href=\"Cloud%20Ruler%20Temple\"&gt;Cloud Ruler Temple&lt;/a&gt; to keep him safe from the Mythic Dawn.\nThe Mythic Dawn would take a more aggressive approach to their enemies going forward. &lt;a href=\"Baurus\"&gt;Baurus&lt;/a&gt;, a Blades agent, had located a Mythic Dawn agent by the name of &lt;a href=\"Astav%20Wirich\"&gt;Astav Wirich&lt;/a&gt;. Astav attempted to assassinate Baurus, but failed due to the aid of the &lt;a href=\"Hero%20of%20Kvatch\"&gt;Hero of Kvatch&lt;/a&gt;. Baurus had been looking into the agents of the Mythic Dawn in the &lt;a href=\"Imperial%20City\"&gt;Imperial City&lt;/a&gt;, which resulted in him being targeted by the cult. Astav Wirich had carried a copy of the first volume of the Mythic Dawn Commentaries, however, and this would provide a lead in the case. &lt;a href=\"Tar-Meena\"&gt;Tar-Meena&lt;/a&gt;, an expert on Daedric Cults at the &lt;a href=\"Arcane%20University\"&gt;Arcane University&lt;/a&gt; was consulted to learn more about the Mythic Dawn by the Blades. With the aid of Tar-Meena, the Blades discovered the hidden shrine to Mehrunes Dagon of the Mythic Dawn in the &lt;a href=\"Lake%20Arrius%20Caverns\"&gt;Lake Arrius Caverns&lt;/a&gt;. Here, the Mythic Dawn would be dealt a significant blow, by losing the Mysterium Xarxes to the Hero of Kvatch. The Amulet of Kings could not be retrieved, however, as Mankar Camoran managed to escape to Paradise.\nThrough the aid of the Mysterium Xarxes, Martin Septim would slowly discover the means to create a portal to Paradise. The Mythic Dawn, having suffered greatly at the Shrine, would continue their attempts to stop the Blades. Two of the Chosen of the Mythic Dawn were sent out to spy on Cloud Ruler Temple and create a Great Gate at &lt;a href=\"Bruma\"&gt;Bruma&lt;/a&gt;. Prior to doing this, however, they would open a normal Oblivion Gate just outside the walls of Bruma, which would be closed by the City Watch and the Hero of Kvatch. After having learned the plans regarding the Great Gate at Bruma, the other counties of Cyrodiil were requested for aid. All of these counties were hesitant, however, until the Oblivion Gates outside of their own walls would be shut.\nNot long after the Mythic Dawn would create the Great Gate, hoping to overrun Bruma and trap Martin and his Blades in Cloud Ruler Temple. The Blades had counted on this, however, and instead used the Great Gate to obtain the final piece needed to create a portal to Paradise; a &lt;a href=\"Great%20Sigil%20Stone%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;Great Sigil Stone&lt;/a&gt;. The attempt by the cult to destroy Bruma had failed. After obtaining the Stone, Martin created the portal to Paradise, and the Hero of Kvatch entered to confront Mankar Camoran and retrieve the Amulet of Kings.\nWithin Paradise, those of the Mythic Dawn who had died had been granted what they had been promised, immortality. Some of these Mythic Dawn members remained optimistic in their ideas of returning to Tamriel as lords, while most were unhappy as they were being tormented by the Daedra on a constant basis. This was done to temper them to rule over Tamriel Reborn. Mankar would be slain in Paradise, and the Amulet of Kings would be retrieved. Paradise was now destroyed, and Martin Septim had the means required to become Emperor. In the Imperial City, the Mythic Dawn made their final attempt at stopping the &lt;a href=\"Dragonfires\"&gt;Dragonfires&lt;/a&gt; from being lit again. While Martin was in the &lt;a href=\"White-Gold%20Tower\"&gt;White-Gold Tower&lt;/a&gt; to be formally recognized as Emperor, the Mythic Dawn had opened Oblivion Gates within the Temple District. While Martin, the Blades, and Legion soldiers rushed to the Temple, they were too late to light the Dragonfires, as Mehrunes Dagon had entered Tamriel. The Amulet of Kings would then be used by Martin Septim to turn into an avatar of Akatosh, and battle Dagon. Coming out victorious, the Oblivion Crisis ended.\n&lt;a href=\"Fourth%20Era\"&gt;Fourth Era&lt;/a&gt;.\nDuring the Fourth Era groups were formed dedicated to wiping out the remnants of the Mythic Dawn. One of these groups, known as the &lt;a href=\"Keepers%20of%20the%20Razor\"&gt;Keepers of the Razor&lt;/a&gt;, eliminated the Mythic Dawn members in possession of the pieces of &lt;a href=\"Mehrunes%27%20Razor\"&gt;Mehrunes' Razor&lt;/a&gt;, which took place around &lt;a href=\"4E%2051\"&gt;4E 51&lt;/a&gt;. How they obtained the Razor is unknown, as the failed expedition of &lt;a href=\"Frathen%20Drothan\"&gt;Frathen Drothan&lt;/a&gt; for the Razor in &lt;a href=\"3E%20433\"&gt;3E 433&lt;/a&gt; was unrelated to this group. One descendant of a Mythic Dawn assassin, known as &lt;a href=\"Silus%20Vesuius\"&gt;Silus Vesuius&lt;/a&gt;, required these pieces to complete his collection of Mythic Dawn artifacts in his museum in &lt;a href=\"4E%20201\"&gt;4E 201&lt;/a&gt;. It is unknown if he was successful or not.\nMembers.\nThe following are members of the Mythic Dawn in ."}

They do not increase skills.\nContents.\nMythic Dawn Commentaries 1.\nGreetings, novitiate, and know first a reassurance: &lt;a href=\"Mankar%20Camoran\"&gt;Mankar Camoran&lt;/a&gt; was once like you, asleep, unwise, protonymic. We mortals leave the dreaming-sleeve of birth the same, unmantled save for the symbiosis with our mothers, thus to practice and thus to rapprochement, until finally we might through new eyes leave our hearths without need or fear that she remains behind. In this moment we destroy her forever and enter the demesne of &lt;a href=\"Mehrunes%20Dagon\"&gt;Lord Dagon&lt;/a&gt;.\nReader, this book is your door to that demesne and though you be a destroyer you must still submit to locks. Lord Dagon would only have those clever enough to pause; all else the &lt;a href=\"Aurbis\"&gt;Aurbis&lt;/a&gt; claims in their fool running. Walk first. Heed. The impatience you feel is your first slave to behead.\nEnter as Lord Dagon has written: come slow and bring four &lt;a href=\"keys\"&gt;keys&lt;/a&gt;. Know that then you are royalty, a new breed of destroyer, whose garden shall flood with flowers known and unknown, as it was in the mythic dawn. Thus shall you return to your first primal wail and yet come out different. It shall this time be neonymbiosis, master akin to Master, whose Mother is miasma.\nEvery quarter has known us, and none bore our passing except with trembling. Perhaps you came to us through war, or study, or shadow, or the alignment of certain snakes. Though each path matters in its kind, the prize is always thus: welcome, novitiate, that you are here at all means that you have the worthiness of kings. Seek thy pocket now, and look! There is the first key, glinting with the light of a new dawn.\nNight follows day, and so know that this primary insight shall fall alike unto the turbulent evening sea where all faiths are tested. Again, a reassurance: even the &lt;a href=\"Camoran%20Usurper\"&gt;Usurper&lt;/a&gt; went under the &lt;a href=\"Iliac%20Bay\"&gt;Iliac&lt;/a&gt; before he rose up to claim his fleet. Fear only for a second. Shaken belief is like water for a purpose: in the garden of the Dawn we shall breathe whole realities.\nEnter as Lord Dagon has written: come slow and bring four keys. Our Order is based on the principles of his mighty razor: Novitiate, Questing Knight, Chaplain, and Master. Let the evil ones burn in its light as if by the excess of our vision. Then shalt our Knowledge go aright. However, recall that your sight is yet narrow, and while you have the invitation, you have not the address.\nMy own summons came through a book Lord Dagon wrote himself in the deserts of rust and wounds. Its name is the '&lt;a href=\"Mysterium%20Xarxes\"&gt;Mysterium Xarxes&lt;/a&gt;', Aldmeretada aggregate, forefather to the wife of all enigma. Each word is razor-fed and secret, thinner than cataclysms, tarnished like red-drink. That I mention it at all is testament to your new rank, my child. Your name is now cut into its weight.\nPalace, hut, or cave, you have left all the fog worlds of conception behind. Nu-mantia! Liberty! Rejoice in the promise of paradise!\nEndlessly it shall form and reform around you, deeds as entities, all-systems only an hour before they bloom to zero sums, flowering like vestments, divine raiment worn to dance at Lord Dagon's golden feet. In his first arm, a storm, his second the rush of plagued rain, the third all the tinder of &lt;a href=\"Anu\"&gt;Anu&lt;/a&gt;, and the fourth the very eyes of &lt;a href=\"Padomay\"&gt;Padhome&lt;/a&gt;. Feel uplifted in thine heart that you have this first key, for it shall strike high and low into the wormrot of false heavens.\nRoaring I wandered until I grew hoarse with the gospel. I had read the mysteries of Lord Dagon and feeling anew went mad with the overflow. My words found no purchase until I became hidden. These were not words for the common of &lt;a href=\"Tamriel\"&gt;Tamriel&lt;/a&gt;, whose clergy long ago feigned the very existence of the Dawn. Learn from my mistake; know that humility was Mankar Camoran's original wisdom. Come slow, and bring four keys.\nOffering myself to that daybreak allowed the girdle of grace to contain me. When my voice returned, it spoke with another tongue. After three nights I could speak fire.\nRed-drink, razor-fed, I had glimpsed the path unto the garden, and knew that to inform others of its harbor I had to first drown myself in search's sea. Know ye that I have found my fleet, and that you are the flagship of my hope. Greetings, novitiate, Mankar Camoran was once you, asleep, unwise, protonymic, but Am No More. Now I sit and wait to feast with thee on all the worlds of this cosmos. Nu-mantia! Liberty!\nMythic Dawn Commentaries 2.\nWhosoever findeth this document, I call him brother.\nAnswers are liberations, where the slaves of Malbioge that came to know Numantia cast down their jailer king, Maztiak, which the &lt;a href=\"Mysterium%20Xarxes\"&gt;Xarxes Mysterium&lt;/a&gt; calls the Arkayn. Maztiak, whose carcass was dragged through the streets by his own bone-walkers and whose flesh was opened on rocks thereon and those angels who loved him no longer did drink from his honeyed ichors screaming \"Let all know free will and do as they will!\"\nYour coming was foretold, my brother, by the &lt;a href=\"Mehrunes%20Dagon\"&gt;Lord Dagon&lt;/a&gt; in his book of &lt;a href=\"Mehrunes%27%20Razor\"&gt;razors&lt;/a&gt;. You are to come as Idols drop away from you one by one. You are exalted in eyes that have not yet set on you; you, swain to well-travelled to shatterer of mantles. You, brother, are to sit with me in &lt;a href=\"Paradise%20%28Location%29\"&gt;Paradise&lt;/a&gt; and be released of all unknowns. Indeed, I shall show you His book and its foul-and-many-feathered rubric so that you can put into symbols what you already know: the sphere of destruction is but the milk of the unenslaved. I fault not your stumbling, for they are expected and given grace by the Oils. I crave not your downfalls, though without them you might surpass me even in the coming Earth of all infinities. Lord Dagon wishes you no ills but the momentous. And as He wants, you must want, and so learn from the pages of God this: the Ritual of Want:\nWhisper to earth and earth, where the meddlers take no stones except to blood, as blood IS blood, and to the cracking of bone, as bone IS bone, and so to crack and answer and fall before the one and one, I call you Dragon as brother and king.\nHides of &lt;a href=\"Land%20Dreugh\"&gt;dreugh&lt;/a&gt;: 7 and 7, draught of Oil, 1 and 1, circles drawn by wet &lt;a href=\"Dibella\"&gt;Dibellites&lt;/a&gt;: three concentric and let their lower blood fall where it may, a birth watched by blackbirds: Hearthfire 1st. Incant the following when your hearing becomes blurred:\nEnraptured, he who finally goes unrecorded.\nRecorded, the slaves that without knowing turn the Wheel.\nEnslaved, all the children of the Aurbis As It Is.\nMythic Dawn Commentaries 3.\nThe Tower touches all the mantles of Heaven, brother-noviates, and by its apex one can be as he will. More: be as he was and yet changed for all else on that path for those that walk after. This is the third key of Nu-mantia and the secret of how mortals become makers, and makers back to mortals. The Bones of the Wheel need their flesh, and that is mankind's heirloom.\nOath-breakers beware, for their traitors run through the nymic-paths, runner dogs of prolix gods. The &lt;a href=\"Septim%20Dynasty\"&gt;Dragon's Blood&lt;/a&gt; have hidden ascension in six-thousands years of &lt;a href=\"Aetherius\"&gt;aetherial&lt;/a&gt; labyrinth, which is &lt;a href=\"Tamriel\"&gt;Arena&lt;/a&gt;, which they yet deny is Oathbound. By the Book, take this key and pierce the divine shell that encloses the mantle-takers! The skin of gold! SCARAB AE AURBEX!\nWoe to the Oath-breakers! Of the skin of gold, the &lt;a href=\"Mysterium%20Xarxes\"&gt;Xarxes Mysteriuum&lt;/a&gt; says \"Be fooled not by the forlorn that ride astray the roadway, for they lost faith and this losing was caused by the &lt;a href=\"Aedra\"&gt;Aedra&lt;/a&gt; who would know no other planets.\" Whereby the words of &lt;a href=\"Mehrunes%20Dagon\"&gt;Lord Dagon&lt;/a&gt; instructs us to destroy these faithless. \"Eat or bleed dry the gone-forlorn and gain that small will that led them to walk the path of Godhead at the first. Spit out or burn to the side that which made them delay. Know them as the &lt;a href=\"Mnemoli\"&gt;Mnemoli&lt;/a&gt;.\"\nEvery new limb is paid for by the under-known. See, brother, and give not more to the hydra.\nReader, you will sense a shadow-choir soon. The room you are in right now will grow eyes and voices. The candle or spell-light you read this by will become gateways for the traitors I have mentioned. Scorn them and fear not. Call them names, call out their base natures. I, the Mankar of stars, am with you, and I come to take you to my &lt;a href=\"Paradise%20%28Location%29\"&gt;Paradise&lt;/a&gt; where the Tower-traitors shall hang on glass wracks until they smile with the new revolution.\nThat is your ward against the Mnemoli. They run blue, through noise, and shine only when the earth trembles with the eruption of the newly-mantled. Tell them \"Go! GHARTOK AL MNEM! God is come! NUMI MORA! NUM DALAE MNEM!\"\nOnce you walk in the Mythic it surrenders its power to you. Myth is nothing more than first wants. Unutterable truth. Ponder this while searching for the fourth key.\nUnderstood laws of the arcanature will fall away like heat. \"&lt;a href=\"The%20Towers%23Ada-Mantia\"&gt;First Tower&lt;/a&gt; Dictate: render the mutant bound where he may do no more harm. As God of the &lt;a href=\"Mundus\"&gt;Mundus&lt;/a&gt;, alike shall be his progeny, split from their divine sparks. We are Eight time eight Exarchs. Let the home of &lt;a href=\"Padomay\"&gt;Padomay&lt;/a&gt; see us as sole exit.\"\n&lt;a href=\"CHIM\"&gt;CHIM&lt;/a&gt;. Those who know it can reshape the land. Witness &lt;a href=\"Cyrodiil\"&gt;the home&lt;/a&gt; of the &lt;a href=\"Tiber%20Septim\"&gt;Red King&lt;/a&gt; Once Jungled.\nHe that enters Paradise enters his own Mother. AE ALMA RUMA! The Aurbis endeth in all ways.\nEndeth we seek through our &lt;a href=\"Mythic%20Dawn\"&gt;Dawn&lt;/a&gt;, all endeth. Falter now and become one with the wayside orphans that feed me. Follow and I shall adore you from inside. My first daughter ran from the Dagonite road. Her name was &lt;a href=\"Ruma%20Camoran\"&gt;Ruma&lt;/a&gt; and I ate her with no bread, and made another, which learned, and I loved that one and blackbirds formed &lt;a href=\"Raven%20Camoran\"&gt;her twin&lt;/a&gt; behind all time.\nStarlight is your mantle, brother. Wear it to see by and add its light to Paradise.\nMythic Dawn Commentaries 4.\nMay the holder of the fourth key know the heart thereby: the Mundex Terrene was once ruled over solely by the tyrant &lt;a href=\"dreugh\"&gt;dreugh&lt;/a&gt;-kings, each to their own dominion, and borderwars fought between their slave oceans. They were akin to the time-totems of old, yet evil, and full of mockery and profane powers. No one that lived did so outside of the sufferance of the dreughs.\nI give my soul to the &lt;a href=\"Magna%20Ge\"&gt;Magna Ge&lt;/a&gt;, sayeth the joyous in &lt;a href=\"Paradise%20%28Location%29\"&gt;Paradise&lt;/a&gt;, for they created &lt;a href=\"Mehrunes%20Dagon\"&gt;Mehrunes the Razor&lt;/a&gt; in secret, in the very bowels of &lt;a href=\"Lyg\"&gt;Lyg&lt;/a&gt;, the domain of the Upstart who vanishes. Though they came from diverse waters, each Get shared sole purpose: to artifice a prince of good, spinning his likeness in random swath, and imbuing him with Oblivion's most precious and scarce asset: hope.\nDeathlessly I intone from Paradise: Mehrunes the Thieftaker, Mehrunes Godsbody, Mehrunes the Red Arms That Went Up! Nu-Mantia! Liberty!\nDeny not that these days shall come again, my novitiates! For as Mehrunes threw down Lyg and cracked his face, declaring each of the nineteen and nine and nine oceans Free, so shall he crack the serpent crown of the &lt;a href=\"Septim%20bloodline\"&gt;Cyrodiils&lt;/a&gt; and make federation!\nAll will change in these days as it was changed in those, for with by the magic word Nu-Mantia a great rebellion rose up and pulled down the towers of CHIM-EL GHARJYG, and the templars of the Upstart were slaughtered, and blood fell like dew from the upper wards down to the lowest pits, where the slaves with maniacal faces took chains and teeth to their jailers and all hope was brush-fire.\nYour Dawn listens, my Lord! Let all the &lt;a href=\"Aurbis\"&gt;Aurbis&lt;/a&gt; know itself to be Free! Mehrunes is come! There is no dominion save free will!\nSuns were riven as your red legions moved from Lyg to the hinterlands of chill, a legion for each Get, and Kuri was thrown down and Djaf was thrown down and Horma-Gile was crushed with coldsalt and forevermore called Hor and so shall it be again under the time of &lt;a href=\"Oblivion%20Gate\"&gt;Gates&lt;/a&gt;.\nUnder the mires, Malbioge was thrown down, that old City of Chains, slaked in newbone-warmth and set Free. Galg and Mor-Galg were thrown down together in a single night of day and shall it be again under the time of Gates.\nNothing but woe for &lt;a href=\"Nirn\"&gt;NRN&lt;/a&gt; which has become The Pit and seven curses on its Dreugh, the Vermae NI-MOHK! But for it the Crusades would be as my lord's Creation, Get by the Ge and do as thou wilt, of no fetters but your own conscience! Know that your Hell is Broken, people of the Aurbis, and praise the Nu-Mantia which is Liberty!"}

Of the skin of gold, the &lt;a href=\"Mysterium%20Xarxes\"&gt;Xarxes Mysteriuum&lt;/a&gt; says \"Be fooled not by the forlorn that ride astray the roadway, for they lost faith and this losing was caused by the &lt;a href=\"Aedra\"&gt;Aedra&lt;/a&gt; who would know no other planets.\" Whereby the words of &lt;a href=\"Mehrunes%20Dagon\"&gt;Lord Dagon&lt;/a&gt; instructs us to destroy these faithless. \"Eat or bleed dry the gone-forlorn and gain that small will that led them to walk the path of Godhead at the first. Spit out or burn to the side that which made them delay. Know them as the &lt;a href=\"Mnemoli\"&gt;Mnemoli&lt;/a&gt;.\"\nEvery new limb is paid for by the under-known. See, brother, and give not more to the hydra.\nReader, you will sense a shadow-choir soon. The room you are in right now will grow eyes and voices. The candle or spell-light you read this by will become gateways for the traitors I have mentioned. Scorn them and fear not. Call them names, call out their base natures. I, the Mankar of stars, am with you, and I come to take you to my &lt;a href=\"Paradise%20%28Location%29\"&gt;Paradise&lt;/a&gt; where the Tower-traitors shall hang on glass wracks until they smile with the new revolution.\nThat is your ward against the Mnemoli. They run blue, through noise, and shine only when the earth trembles with the eruption of the newly-mantled. Tell them \"Go! GHARTOK AL MNEM! God is come! NUMI MORA! NUM DALAE MNEM!\"\nOnce you walk in the Mythic it surrenders its power to you. Myth is nothing more than first wants. Unutterable truth. Ponder this while searching for the fourth key.\nUnderstood laws of the arcanature will fall away like heat. \"&lt;a href=\"The%20Towers%23Ada-Mantia\"&gt;First Tower&lt;/a&gt; Dictate: render the mutant bound where he may do no more harm. As God of the &lt;a href=\"Mundus\"&gt;Mundus&lt;/a&gt;, alike shall be his progeny, split from their divine sparks. We are Eight time eight Exarchs. Let the home of &lt;a href=\"Padomay\"&gt;Padomay&lt;/a&gt; see us as sole exit.\"\nCHIM. Those who know &lt;a href=\"CHIM\"&gt;it&lt;/a&gt; can reshape the land. Witness the home of the Red King Once Jungled.\nHe that enters Paradise enters his own Mother. AE ALMA RUMA! The Aurbis endeth in all ways.\nEndeth we seek through our &lt;a href=\"Mythic%20Dawn\"&gt;Dawn&lt;/a&gt;, all endeth. Falter now and become one with the wayside orphans that feed me. Follow and I shall adore you from inside. My first daughter ran from the Dagonite road. Her name was &lt;a href=\"Ruma%20Camoran\"&gt;Ruma&lt;/a&gt; and I ate her with no bread, and made another, which learned, and I loved that one and blackbirds formed her twin behind all time.\nStarlight is your mantle, brother. Wear it to see by and add its light to Paradise."}

Though they came from diverse waters, each Get shared sole purpose: to artifice a prince of good, spinning his likeness in random swath, and imbuing him with Oblivion's most precious and scarce asset: hope.\nDeathlessly I intone from Paradise: Mehrunes the Thieftaker, Mehrunes Godsbody, Mehrunes the Red Arms That Went Up! Nu-Mantia! Liberty!\nDeny not that these days shall come again, my novitiates! For as Mehrunes threw down Lyg and cracked his face, declaring each of the nineteen and nine and nine oceans Free, so shall he crack the serpent crown of the &lt;a href=\"Septim%20bloodline\"&gt;Cyrodiils&lt;/a&gt; and make federation!\nAll will change in these days as it was changed in those, for with by the magic word Nu-Mantia a great rebellion rose up and pulled down the towers of CHIM-EL GHARJYG, and the templars of the Upstart were slaughtered, and blood fell like dew from the upper wards down to the lowest pits, where the slaves with maniacal faces took chains and teeth to their jailers and all hope was brush-fire.\nYour Dawn listens, my Lord! Let all the &lt;a href=\"Aurbis\"&gt;Aurbis&lt;/a&gt; know itself to be Free! Mehrunes is come! There is no dominion save free will!\nSuns were riven as your red legions moved from Lyg to the hinterlands of chill, a legion for each Get, and Kuri was thrown down and Djaf was thrown down and Horma-Gile was crushed with coldsalt and forevermore called Hor and so shall it be again under the time of &lt;a href=\"Oblivion%20Gate\"&gt;Gates&lt;/a&gt;.\nUnder the mires, Malbioge was thrown down, that old City of Chains, slaked in newbone-warmth and set Free. Galg and Mor-Galg were thrown down together in a single night of day and shall it be again under the time of Gates.\nNothing but woe for &lt;a href=\"Nirn\"&gt;NRN&lt;/a&gt; which has become The Pit and seven curses on its Dreugh, the Vermae NI-MOHK! But for it the Crusades would be as my lord's Creation, Get by the Ge and do as thou wilt, of no fetters but your own conscience! Know that your Hell is Broken, people of the Aurbis, and praise the Nu-Mantia which is Liberty!"}

Loose translations of recently uncovered &lt;a href=\"Dunmer%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Dunmeri&lt;/a&gt; texts seem to indicate a ritual among the &lt;a href=\"Argonians%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Argonians&lt;/a&gt;, although this may be legend rather than fact.\nIt is said that when a &lt;a href=\"Saxhleel\"&gt;Saxhleel&lt;/a&gt; emerges from juvenescence, it finds a nearby Hist tree to lick sap from its bole. The elements in the sap quicken the hormonal glands, which sprout appropriate organs from which the Argonian's gender can be determined. Immediately afterward, an appropriate mate is found and reproduction occurs. The female soon lays one or more eggs, which are moved to a hatching pool where gestation and spawning takes place.\nWith recent Imperial expeditions into central Black Marsh ending inconclusively (burial sites were marked on the map &lt;a href=\"Cornix%20Caeparius\"&gt;Cornix Caeparius&lt;/a&gt; provided), and the locals reticent to speak of the mysteries of this fabled tree despite our cajoling, we remain alarmingly ungifted in the realm of Hist tree knowledge.\nHead horticulturist &lt;a href=\"Titullinia%20Petillia\"&gt;Titullinia Petillia&lt;/a&gt; of the &lt;a href=\"Imperial%20Palace%20Gardens\"&gt;Imperial Palace Gardens&lt;/a&gt; has requested careful handling and collection of &lt;a href=\"Hist%20Sap\"&gt;Hist Sap&lt;/a&gt; or seeds from this tree, should one be discovered. It may prove to be a considerable boon to our apothecaries."}

He donned his guise of Gentleman With a Cane, and moved from place to place without being recognized. After eleven days and eleven nights, Sheogorath decided that life among mortals was even more boring than his otherworldly existence.\n\"What can I do to make their lives more interesting?\" he said to himself. At that same moment, a young woman nearby commented wistfully to herself, \"The sounds of the birds are so beautiful.\"\nSheogorath silently agreed with her. Mortals could not make the beautiful and inspired calls of birds. Their voices were wretched and mundane. He could not change the nature of mortals, for that was the purview of other Daedric Princes. However, he could give them tools to make beautiful sounds.\nSheogorath took hold of the petulant woman and ripped her asunder. From her tendons he made lutes. From her skull and arm bones he made a drum. From her bones he made flutes. He presented these gifts to the mortals, and thus Music was born.\nSheogorath and King Lyandir.\nKing &lt;a href=\"Lyandir\"&gt;Lyandir&lt;/a&gt; was known to be an exceedingly rational man. He lived in a palace that was a small, simple structure, unadorned with art and ugly to look upon. \"I do not need more than this,\" he would say. \"Why spend my gold on such luxuries when I can spend it on my armies or on great public works?\"\nHis kingdom prospered under his sensible rule. However, the people did not always share the king's sense of practicality. They would build houses that were beautiful to look upon, although not necessarily very practical. They devoted time and energy to works of art. They would celebrate events with lavish festivals. In general, they were quite happy.\nKing Lyandir was disappointed that more of them did not follow his example and lead frugal, sensible lives. He brooded on this for many years. Finally, he decided that his subjects simply didn't understand how much more they could accomplish if they didn't waste time on those frivolous activities. Perhaps, he reasoned, they just needed more examples.\nThe king decreed that all new buildings must be simple, unadorned, and no larger than was necessary for their function. The people were not happy about this, but they liked their king and respected the new law. In a few short years, there were more plain buildings than ornate ones. The citizens used the money saved to make and buy even more lavish art and hold even more excessive celebrations.\nOnce again, King Lyandir decided to provide them a strict example of how beneficial it would be to use their time and resources for more practical purposes. He banned all works of art in the city. The people were quite put out by this, but they knew that their king was doing what he thought was best for them. However, human nature is not so easily denied. In a few more years the city was filled with plain, simple buildings, and devoid of any sort of art. However, the people now had even more money and time to devote to their parties and festivals.\nWith a heavy heart, King Lyandir decided that his people were to be treated like children. And like all children, they needed rules and discipline laid down by great figures of authority to make them understand what was truly important in life. He decreed that there should be no revelry in the city. Singing, dancing, and music were all banned. Even food and drink were limited to water and simple foodstuffs.\nThe people had had enough. Revolt was out of the question, since King Lyandir had a very well trained and equipped army. They visited the shrines and temples in droves, praying to all the gods, and even to some of the Daedric Princes, that King Lyandir would revoke these new, oppressive laws.\nSheogorath heard their pleas and decided to visit King Lyandir. He appeared to the king in his dreams as a field of flowers, each with arms instead of petals and the face of the Madgod in the center. \"I am Lord of the Creative and Lord of the Deranged. Since you have no use for my gifts of creativity, I have decided to bless you with an abundance of my other gift.\"\nFrom that day forward, every child born in the city was born into madness. Since infants do not reveal illnesses of the mind, it was several years before this was realized. The king's own son was among the victims, suffering from seizures and delusions. Yet, King Lyandir refused to change his ways.\nWhen his son, &lt;a href=\"Glint\"&gt;Glint&lt;/a&gt;, was 12 years old, he stabbed his father while Lyandir was sleeping. With his dying breath, King Lyandir asked, \"Why?\" His son replied, \"It is the most practical thing I could do.\"\nThe new, young king ordered all the palace servants slaughtered. He ordered a grand festival to celebrate his new reign and the repeal of Lyandir's laws. He served the crowds a stew made from the carcasses of the palace servants. He ordered the east facing walls of every building painted red, and the west facing walls painted in stripes. He decreed that all citizens wear ornate masks on the backs of their heads. He then burned down the palace and began construction of a new one.\nIn the new palace, the young king ordered his personal chambers to not have any doors; for fear that small woodland creatures would attack him. He ordered that it have no windows for fear that the sun and moon were jealous of him and plotting his death.\nAnd thus ended the line of King Lyandir. The people of the city returned to their grand works of art and raucous celebrations. They talked and acted as if they still had a living king, and even kept up the palace, using it to house and care for their mad children. Sheogorath was mightily pleased with this outcome. From that day forward the city was blessed with more than the normal number of gifted artists and deranged citizens.\nThe Contest of Wills.\nA mighty wizard named &lt;a href=\"Ravate\"&gt;Ravate&lt;/a&gt; once walked the Winds of Time to find Lord Sheogorath. His intent was to win a favor from this most capricious of the Daedric Princes. Upon finding Sheogorath, Ravate spoke humbly to him, \"Lord Sheogorath, I beg a favor of you. I would gladly drive a thousand men mad in your name if you would but grant me the greater magical powers.\"\nFortunately for Ravate, Sheogorath was in a playful mood. He proposed a game, \"I will grant your wish, if you are still sane in three days. During that time, I will do my utmost to drive you mad. It shall be great fun.\"\nRavate was not so certain that he liked this new deal. He had been really looking forward to driving a thousand men mad. \"Lord Sheogorath, I regret having disturbed you with my shallow, selfish request. I withdraw my unfortunate plea and will humbly leave this place.\"\nSheogorath just laughed, \"Too late, mighty Ravate. The game is afoot, and you must play.\" Ravate fled, only to find that all exits from the Daedric realm were now sealed. He wandered aimlessly, constantly looking over his shoulder, jumping at every noise. Each moment brought new terror as he waited for Sheogorath to begin.\nAfter three days, Ravate was convinced that every plant and animal was a tool of Sheogorath. He hadn't eaten or drunk for fear that Sheogorath had poisoned the food or drink. He hadn't slept for fear of Sheogorath invading his dreams. (Which was foolish, as dreams are the domain of &lt;a href=\"Vaermina\"&gt;Vaermina&lt;/a&gt;, may She grant us Restful Sleep.)\nIt was then that Sheogorath appeared to him. Ravate cried out, \"You have set the whole world to watching me! Every creature and plant are doing your bidding to drive me mad.\"\nSheogorath replied, \"Actually, I have done nothing. You have driven yourself mad with your fears. Your delusions prove that you are truly deranged, and therefore I win. While you wanted to make a thousand men mad, I only wanted to break one man's mind, yours.\"\nFrom that day forward Ravate served Sheogorath's every whim. Whenever daring travelers try to approach Sheogorath, Ravate warns them, \"Sheogorath is already inside each of us. You have already lost.\""}

It is involved in a &lt;a href=\"Dark%20Brotherhood%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Dark Brotherhood&lt;/a&gt; quest, as well as a &lt;a href=\"Grimsever%27s%20Return\"&gt;favor quest&lt;/a&gt; for &lt;a href=\"Mjoll%20the%20Lioness\"&gt;Mjoll the Lioness&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Riften%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Riften&lt;/a&gt;. The Gatehouse of Mzinchaleft houses an entrance to &lt;a href=\"Blackreach%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Blackreach&lt;/a&gt;. It is accessible\u00a0through the main quest. There is also a set of &lt;a href=\"Falmer%20Armor\"&gt;Falmer Armor&lt;/a&gt; in Mzinchaleft behind a gate with an Expert level lock.\nHistory.\nMzinchaleft shows the ancient struggle between the &lt;a href=\"Dwemer\"&gt;Dwemer&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Falmer%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Falmer&lt;/a&gt;. The\u00a0Falmer now lurk in their former masters' ruins, killing off Dwarven sentinels and constantly preparing for their war against the light dwellers.\nWalkthrough.\nOutside Mzinchaleft, there are multiple &lt;a href=\"Bandits%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;bandits&lt;/a&gt;, who can be avoided with a high enough &lt;a href=\"Sneak%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Sneak&lt;/a&gt; skill.\nOnce inside, the &lt;a href=\"Last%20Dragonborn\"&gt;Dragonborn&lt;/a&gt; faces various &lt;a href=\"bandit%20plunderer\"&gt;bandit plunderer&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"Dwarven%20Spider%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Dwarven spiders&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Dwarven%20Sphere%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;spheres&lt;/a&gt; on the first level. The path winds generally to the north. At one point, a bandit can be found with Maluril's room key. Along the second westward-bound section of the path is an opening to the right (north) that contains a bandit camp with various armor and potions on tables, plus a chest with a &lt;a href=\"Leveled%20Items%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;leveled&lt;/a&gt; sword.\nJust beyond that is a crossroads with an open gate straight ahead (west, leading to nothing), a hallway sloping down to the left (south) that leads to a closed gate, and an Adept-locked door to the right (north). The right-hand door leads to &lt;a href=\"Maluril\"&gt;Maluril&lt;/a&gt;'s room. Aside from Maluril himself, &lt;a href=\"Maluril%27s%20Journal\"&gt;Maluril's Journal&lt;/a&gt; is on a table, and a chest is nearby. The &lt;a href=\"Speech\"&gt;Speech&lt;/a&gt; skill book \"&lt;a href=\"A%20Dance%20in%20Fire%2C%20Book%20VII\"&gt;A Dance in Fire, Book VII&lt;/a&gt;\" is on another table in the same room.\nThe left-hand path leads down to a room with steps up on both sides (which simply lead to ledges on either side of the room). Across the room to the south is another open door. This leads to a path that turns west, north, and west again. There are several Dwarven spiders and guardians along the way. The path turns north again, then back to the east to a closed gate.\nBeyond that gate is a puzzle involving a series of levers. To get to the final room, the levers must be toggled in the correct order. This puzzle is made much easier using the &lt;a href=\"Slow%20Time\"&gt;Slow Time&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"Whirlwind%20Sprint\"&gt;Whirlwind Sprint&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"shouts\"&gt;shouts&lt;/a&gt; to run past the moving bars. To solve the lever puzzle:\nAfter this, the path to the south is clear. Past a closed door is an elevator to &lt;a href=\"Mzinchaleft%20Depths\"&gt;Mzinchaleft Depths&lt;/a&gt;.\nMzinchaleft Depths.\nUpon entering the Depths, there is a huge room with walkways above green water. (Underwater, there is a gate near a set of stairs leading into the water. Beyond the underwater gate is a submerged entryway to a three-room area. In the left room is an unlocked chest with leveled loot, and the right room has Dwemer tableware. These may be collected without the use of potions of Water-Breathing, but non-essential &lt;a href=\"Followers%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;followers&lt;/a&gt; are likely to get lost behind you and drown. It is advisable to have them wait for you on dry land.)\u00a0\nThere are several &lt;a href=\"Falmer%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Falmer&lt;/a&gt; here. At the first intersection, proceeding to the left (west) leads to a dead end with a Falmer tent. To the right (east) is another intersection. Turning right again (to the south) leads to a platform with a &lt;a href=\"Chaurus%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Chaurus&lt;/a&gt; and a chest\u00a0in the back corner\u00a0with leveled loot, plus\u00a03\u00a0&lt;a href=\"Glowing%20Mushroom%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;glowing mushrooms&lt;/a&gt; and\u00a0many &lt;a href=\"chaurus%20eggs\"&gt;chaurus eggs&lt;/a&gt;. There is also a ballista on the same platform, but it is not possible to interact with it.\u00a0\nBack at the second intersection (under a pavilion),\u00a0there is a chest on a ledge to the north that is most likely only reachable with the\u00a0&lt;a href=\"Whirlwind%20Sprint\"&gt;Whirlwind Sprint&lt;/a&gt;\u00a0shout. It contains randomized loot. This chest is also reachable by jumping into the water and climbing up the wall directly to the west of the chest, or by walking around the ledge to the east, and jumping up the wall.\nContinuing east from the second intersection leads to another platform with a Falmer. There are also steps that lead down to the water, and a large closed door that opens to the east. To the south, the steps down to the\u00a0water lead to an underwater gate in the southeast corner (against the south wall). This gate leads to a table with\u00a0&lt;a href=\"Dwarven%20Oil%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Dwarven Oil&lt;/a&gt;\u00a0on a table, as well as 2 chests (one of which is in an underwater bedroom). Some type of waterbreathing (spell, potion, enchantment) will be helpful as it is all underwater, but if not over-encumbered and aware of the loot locations, it can be completed in multiple dives. The chests contain random loot. Another underwater chest is below the one requiring rock jumping or the shout.\nTo the north is a walkway that leads nowhere, but has several Falmer on it, along with\u00a03\u00a0&lt;a href=\"Dwemer%20cog\"&gt;Dwemer cog&lt;/a&gt;s, a\u00a0&lt;a href=\"Falmer%20bow\"&gt;Falmer bow&lt;/a&gt;, and 2\u00a0chaurus eggs\u00a0on a table. A double staircase leads down to the water to the west.\u00a0At its bottom, there is another completely submerged staircase that leads down to the south.\nBack up on dry land at the top of the stairs, the door leads to steps down to the south, and the path winds until it opens on a room that appears to be some type of court room (with a high bench, two tables in front, and benches for an audience). There are two more Falmer here.\nAgainst the north wall of this room, a path leads east, then turns north again. After a long straight path, it turns west again to a room with a chaurus, a Falmer, and a trap with tripwire at the entrance. On a ledge overlooking the room are two Falmer huts, one containing a chest with leveled loot. There are many chaurus egg sacs scattered throughout the room.\nThe path continues north, then west, where the rough cave ends and the Dwarven ruins begin again. A gate leads to a large room with a fountain in the middle. There are several more Falmer here. Steps to the southwest lead to a spike gate that cannot yet be opened. In the northwest corner of the room is a spiral ramp with a Falmer tent in front that has three chests (two outside, one inside) containing leveled loot. The ramp leads up to a walkway with an expert-locket gate to the north and an unlocked (but closed) Falmer gate to the south. Behind the Falmer gate is a Falmer, tables with various loot, and a button. Activating the button opens the spike gate.\nBehind the Expert-locked gate, the path goes left and right. To the right (east) is a table with an extremely rare set of\u00a0&lt;a href=\"Falmer%20Armor\"&gt;Falmer Armor&lt;/a&gt;\u00a0on it, plus a chest with a scroll and other loot. To the left is another table with a chest with leveled loot.\nBack in the fountain room and up the steps, there is another fountain, but there are also two Falmer, one being a very high level (e.g. &lt;a href=\"Falmer%20Warmonger\"&gt;Falmer Warmonger&lt;/a&gt;). An adept-locked door leads south southeast, while a gate to the north leads to a long set of steps up. The south door leads to a room with much loot: a chest that contains a levelled weapon, a &lt;a href=\"Centurion%20Dynamo%20Core\"&gt;Centurion Dynamo Core&lt;/a&gt; on a table, along with much Dwemer scrap metal and a dead &lt;a href=\"Dwarven%20Centurion%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Dwarven Centurion&lt;/a&gt; that holds more loot. The steps on the other side lead up to the entrance to the &lt;a href=\"Mzinchaleft%20Gatehouse\"&gt;Mzinchaleft Gatehouse&lt;/a&gt;.\nMzinchaleft Gatehouse.\nIn the final room, the Mzinchaleft Gatehouse (which also contains a passage to &lt;a href=\"Blackreach%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Blackreach&lt;/a&gt;), the Dragonborn is required to fight a &lt;a href=\"Dwarven%20Centurion%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Dwarven Centurion&lt;/a&gt; (leveled) and a &lt;a href=\"Dwarven%20Sphere%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Dwarven Sphere&lt;/a&gt;. At this point, without the required quest item, the Dragonborn may only return to the surface via a lift (to the west side of the Gatehouse, behind where the centurion was waiting) directly to Skyrim. Against the north wall (behind the steps) is a spear gate. Up the steps is a ledge with nothing, but from there, it is possible to walk across the pipes to two other ledges, where pieces of Dwarven armor can be found.\u00a0Mjoll the Lioness' sword, &lt;a href=\"Grimsever\"&gt;Grimsever&lt;/a&gt;, is found to the right of the Dwarven Centurion, on a pedestal. It may be covered by a shield. It is possible to use a potion of invisibility, grab Grimsever, then quickly dart out of the room as the potion wears off after grabbing the sword.\nUpon taking the elevator to Skyrim, a lever to the right can be pulled to permanently unlock a quick route for future use. It is due west of where Mzinchaleft is marked on the world map, next to a north-south road.\nNote that the &lt;a href=\"Attunement%20Sphere\"&gt;Attunement Sphere&lt;/a&gt; is needed to activate the &lt;a href=\"Dwarven%20Mechanism\"&gt;Dwarven Mechanism&lt;/a&gt; (which is to the southwest in the Gatehouse). The Sphere can be obtained from &lt;a href=\"Septimus%20Signus\"&gt;Septimus Signus&lt;/a&gt; at &lt;a href=\"Septimus%20Signus%27%20Outpost\"&gt;Septimus Signus' Outpost&lt;/a&gt; which is north of the &lt;a href=\"College%20of%20Winterhold%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;College of Winterhold&lt;/a&gt;. Once activated, a set of steps surrounding the mechanism is revealed that lead down to a door to Blackreach."}

After clearing all of &lt;a href=\"Mzinchaleft\"&gt;Mzinchaleft&lt;/a&gt;, including the Gatehouse, elevator access from a road in &lt;a href=\"Skyrim\"&gt;Skyrim&lt;/a&gt; to the Gatehouse is available, thus allowing for quick access to Blackreach as well.\nThere is a gated alcove on the north side of the Gatehouse with some &lt;a href=\"Dwemer\"&gt;Dwemer&lt;/a&gt; metal and an unlocked chest containing &lt;a href=\"Random%20Loot%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;leveled loot&lt;/a&gt;. The lever operating the gate is attached to a column to the right of the gate, at about eye level.\nElevator to and from Skyrim.\nWhen entering the Mzinchaleft Gatehouse for the first time, a Dwarven Centurion becomes activated and must be defeated. Once he is, access is granted to an elevator that can take players back up to &lt;a href=\"Skyrim\"&gt;Skyrim&lt;/a&gt;. From Skyrim, the same elevator can be accessed for quick entry into the Mzinchaleft Gatehouse, and therefore, Blackreach.\nThis elevator only becomes available for use from Skyrim once Mzinchaleft (and the Gatehouse) have been cleared. The Skyrim access point to the elevator down to the Gatehouse is just northwest of Mzinchaleft, along the road.\nAccess to Blackreach.\nAnother benefit of the Mzinchaleft Gatehouse is the access door into Blackreach. Inside of the Gatehouse, there is a pedestal where a &lt;a href=\"Dwarven%20Mechanism\"&gt;Dwarven Mechanism&lt;/a&gt; can be activated. You will need the &lt;a href=\"Attunement%20Sphere\"&gt;Attunement Sphere&lt;/a&gt; to activate the Dwarven Mechanism, which can be obtained from &lt;a href=\"Septimus%20Signus\"&gt;Septimus Signus&lt;/a&gt; at &lt;a href=\"Septimus%20Signus%27s%20Outpost\"&gt;Septimus Signus's Outpost&lt;/a&gt; which is north of the College of Winterhold. Once it is, the floor will drop down into a spiral staircase that will lead directly to a set of doors giving access to Blackreach.\nOnce the Gatehouse has been cleared, and therefore unlocked, access to Blackreach can be achieved quickly by traveling from Skyrim, down the elevator (entrance found on the road just northwest of Mzinchaleft), into the Gatehouse, and then down the staircase to Blackreach's entrance."}

I just need to hold one near one of these Dwemer memory devices (the ones with the crystals) and the energy will rush into it, along with the associated information. But I'd need to find an orb to copy the information to. That's more of an issue. All I've found are glass shards, and the few intact orbs I've found have been smashed in altercations with the constructs. They seem to want to destroy the orbs rather than let me have one.\nWait a moment. Something's happening. Why are the vault doors closing?\n4th Sun's Dawn, 2E 129\nI'm estimating on the time. It's probably the next day by now. The vault doors have closed behind me, and are quite thoroughly locked. I'll have to come up with a different way to escape.

N'Gasta does not live on the main island however, he lives north west on a smaller island that was named after him, the &lt;a href=\"Isle%20of%20N%27Gasta\"&gt;Isle of N'Gasta&lt;/a&gt;, in an old wizard's tower. &lt;a href=\"Clavicus%20Vile\"&gt;Clavicus Vile&lt;/a&gt; grants N'Gasta favors in turn for souls. He also serves the &lt;a href=\"Mannimarco%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;King of Worms&lt;/a&gt; who gave N'Gasta the permission to live on the island.\nN'Gasta had dealings with the new governor &lt;a href=\"Amiel%20Richton\"&gt;Amiel Richton&lt;/a&gt;, and gave him a gift in form of a red diamond amulet within a dragon setting. &lt;a href=\"Cyrus%20%28Redguard%29\"&gt;Cyrus&lt;/a&gt; took the job offer to deliver the amulet, which later turned out to be Prince A'Tor's soul gem, on his own agendas. After discovering N'Gasta was in possession of his sister, he went to the island and confronted him. There he found out N'Gasta was in possession of her body and his lord Clavicus Vile was in possession of her soul gem. In order to defend himself, N'Gasta hid in his tower guarded by undead and daedra. Cyrus later reached N'Gasta and killed him, and went to Clavicus Vile's realm to retrieve his sister.

What service?\"\nN'Gasta: \"\"Iszara came thither three months ago, pleading this one to help her free Prince A'Tor from the soulgem. The dim child had even brought the soulgem with her. This one told her the deed might be accomplished, but, knowing the eagerness of a client, this one was quite candid about the high price of such services. In return for her soul, this one agreed to free her beloved Prince &lt;a href=\"A%27Tor\"&gt;A'Tor&lt;/a&gt;. Perhaps you will count my fee too dear, but cannot the client best judge the true value of a service?\"\"\nCyrus: \"Worm. If you will restore her to me now, I give you my word... I will not allow myself to bring you harm.\"\nN'Gasta: \"That is quite impossible, of course. Her soul is long since delivered to Clavicus Vile, patron Daedra Lord, within whose distant realm your sister's soul now resides. This one admits to have been dilatory in his part of the bargain, for the Prince's lifeforce rests still within the soulgem -- the very soulgem that adorns the amulet that you delivered to Lord Richton. Ah, well... This one has ages ahead to fulfill the bargain. And it seems petty to deny Lord Richton the pleasure of wearing his defeated enemy's soul like a trinket? Don't you think?\"\nCyrus: \"Worm, restore her now.\"\nN'Gasta: \"Or...?\"\nCyrus: \"I will kill you, more quickly than you deserve, and just talk to Vile myself.\"\nN'Gasta: \"Now, now. Let your sister serve as a walking, talking cautionary tale, Cyrus. Would you repeat her mistakes by trifling with this one?

Knowing that the Crown's navy was powerful, Richton assigned Nafaalilargus the task of defeating the navy in order to destroy Prince A'Tor and the Redguard resistance. After A'tor was hit by a poisoned arrow, Nafaalilargus destroyed his ship with a single fiery breath. The loss of A'tor and Stros M'kai brought about the surrender of the Crowns and the &lt;a href=\"Province\"&gt;Province&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"Hammerfell\"&gt;Hammerfell&lt;/a&gt; to fall under the &lt;a href=\"Imperial%20Legion\"&gt;dominion of Tiber Septim&lt;/a&gt;.\nWhen Lord Richton became the provincial governor of Stros M'kai, he ordered Nafaalilargus to guard the soul gem of Prince A'Tor.

Cyrus was confronted by Nafaalilargus, who had locked the &lt;a href=\"Redguard\"&gt;Redguard&lt;/a&gt; in his chambers. After a long and difficult battle, Cyrus managed to kill Nafaalilargus. His death considerably weakened the Imperial leverage on the island. However, since Nafaalilargus is a &lt;a href=\"Dragons%20%28Lore%29\"&gt;Dragon&lt;/a&gt; and Cyrus is not a &lt;a href=\"Dragonborn%20%28Lore%29\"&gt;Dragonborn&lt;/a&gt;, it can be assumed that he is not truly dead.\nDuring the &lt;a href=\"Dragon%20Crisis\"&gt;Dragon Crisis&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"4E%20201\"&gt;4E 201&lt;/a&gt;, it is unknown if &lt;a href=\"Alduin\"&gt;Alduin&lt;/a&gt; resurrected Nafaalilargus.\nInteractions.\n&lt;a href=\"Resurrecting%20Prince%20A%27Tor\"&gt;Resurrecting Prince A'Tor&lt;/a&gt;.\nNafaalilargus will be guarding Prince &lt;a href=\"A%27Tor\"&gt;A'Tor&lt;/a&gt;'s soul gem in the catacombs. Once Cyrus enters his chamber filled with piles of &lt;a href=\"Septim%20%28Coin%29\"&gt;gold&lt;/a&gt;, the door will close behind him.

He is quite strong, and will take dozens of hits to kill. He will walk around, bite, and shoot fireballs. During battle, he will also yell multiple statements. Once he is killed, his corpse will fall to the ground, though he does not disintegrate. The piles of gold in his chamber can then be looted."}

Please, understand. I do this for you.\nLovingly yours,Nafarion"}

Baked lamb and squash. I guess I shouldn't be surprised. Adeena is as predictable as the sunrise. Honestly, sometimes I think my goats have a more exciting life than I do. Every time I bring them here to the ruins, it's like they're seeing them for the first time. I envy them. But every day is the same for Najan and &lt;a href=\"Adeena\"&gt;Adeena&lt;/a&gt;. Same meal, same awkward conversation, same tedious love-making. I can't even be angry with her. When I look across the table all I feel is \u2026 nothing.\n12th &lt;a href=\"First%20Seed\"&gt;First Seed&lt;/a&gt;\nI can scarcely believe what I've found. One of my smaller &lt;a href=\"Goat%20%28Online%29\"&gt;goats&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Husul\"&gt;Husul&lt;/a&gt;, ran off while I was kicking dung off my sandal. I gave chase and found he had scrambled down into a vault beneath the ruins. It's dark down here, but not so dark that I need a candle to see. These old blue stones glow and hum softly. Even though it's nothing but cold, wet stone, there is something almost inviting about this place. I have decided to call it &lt;a href=\"Husul%27s%20Cave\"&gt;Husul's Cave&lt;/a&gt;. I can't wait to explore it more thoroughly. I already noticed some old books just waiting to be read.\nIn the meantime, I must go suffer through another flavorless meal with Adeena. She's always asking me if I'm pleased with the food. Offering to wash my clothes. &lt;a href=\"Ruptga\"&gt;Ruptga&lt;/a&gt; help me.\n16th First Seed\nI've found something\u2014something that will change everything. I was leafing through one of the old books I found when I noticed something shimmering stuck in between the leaves. It was a talisman. It appeared simple at first, but when I rubbed away the dirt and grime I saw it was something priceless.\nThen an ethereal woman appeared. She was beautiful beyond measure. I could scarcely speak when I saw her, but she was so kind\u2014she simply giggled. A sweet little laugh. It put me at ease long enough for me to introduce myself.\nHer name is Anexiel. She says she is an ancient spirit of the ruins\u2014something like a saint, I guess. To my mind, she's something far greater than that. Her eyes are like the water in an oasis, and she has a voice like \u2026 oh look at me, playing the poet! I cannot deny it\u2014I have fallen in love with this spirit. If only she were flesh and blood \u2026 I would make her mine.\n18th First Seed\nI am in agony. &lt;a href=\"Anexiel\"&gt;Anexiel&lt;/a&gt; is all I've ever wanted. Each day my love for her grows, yet we cannot be together. She remains a wisp of air\u2014tied to these twice-cursed ruins! Oh how she teases me! Dressed in that shimmering silk, tracing her ghostly fingertip down my shoulder. It's all so \u2026 intimate. I had to tell her how I felt. She said she needed time to think. I hope I haven't ruined things.\n24th First Seed\nShe loves me! I knew it! Sweet Anexiel finally confessed her love today, but now she is miserable too. Gods help us.\n25th First Seed\nShe has a plan! My sweet Anexiel has been walking the halls of the vault, thinking, for what seems like days. She finally came to me and said that she can become flesh and blood, but she needs a \"vessel.\" Someone she can step into and live inside. I don't know how it works exactly.

At each Level, the Oblivion Gate is given 2 additional &lt;a href=\"Health%20%28Legends%29\"&gt;Health&lt;/a&gt; and grants buffs to the player's &lt;a href=\"Daedra%20%28Legends%29\"&gt;Daedra&lt;/a&gt;:\nAfter Level 5, the Oblivion Gate will continue to gain 2 health and Daedra will gain additional &lt;a href=\"Keywords\"&gt;Keywords&lt;/a&gt;."}

The Master has made its destruction the top priority of the Order, and &lt;a href=\"Mehrunes%20Dagon\"&gt;Lord Dagon&lt;/a&gt; has committed whatever resources are required.\nPending your report on the Septim's activities at Cloud Ruler Temple, and your assessment of Temple defenses and possible routes of escape, we plan to open a Great Gate in the open ground before &lt;a href=\"Bruma%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;Bruma&lt;/a&gt; as soon as possible.\nRemember: the first three Lesser Gates represent only the preliminary stages of Great Gate Deployment. Do not in any way compromise your cover in defense of these gates. New ones can be quickly and easily reopened. And once the Great Gate is opened, the fall of Bruma is assured. Cloud Ruler Temple cannot stand long after that, and the Septim will be caught like a rat in a trap.\nWe would welcome any further details you can offer concerning the &lt;a href=\"Hero%20of%20Kvatch\"&gt;Imperial agent&lt;/a&gt; who rescued Martin from &lt;a href=\"Kvatch%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;Kvatch&lt;/a&gt;, but again, we caution you... do not risk a confrontation. This individual is not to be trifled with.\nThe Dawn is breaking,\n&lt;a href=\"Ruma%20Camoran\"&gt;Ruma Camoran&lt;/a&gt;"}

According to the tales, he was a great beast of a man who stood head and shoulders above the tallest men of his crew and possessed of the strength of a bear, the heart of a saber cat and the ferocity of a troll. His weapons of choice were a war axe he inherited from his father called Relkjard, or \"Foecrusher,\" and a silver-edged greatsword of burnished steel he'd forged himself and called Bjarskor, meaning \"Fireblade,\" and he wore a suit of armor fashioned by the finest Atmoran craftsmen from metals of the highest quality.\nJeek commanded a longboat named &lt;a href=\"Jorrvaskr%20%28Ship%29\"&gt;\"Jorrvaskr\"&lt;/a&gt; - whose hull is now used as the roof of the &lt;a href=\"The%20Companions\"&gt;Companions&lt;/a&gt;' mead hall that also bears its proud name - and its crew of twenty-two warriors.\nHe lived sometime in the late &lt;a href=\"Merethic%20Era\"&gt;Merethic Era&lt;/a&gt;.\nDeeds.\nJeek of the River and his crew split from the rest of the captains after the &lt;a href=\"Circle%20of%20Captains\"&gt;Circle of Captains&lt;/a&gt; was assembled. They went southwards towards the area that was later named &lt;a href=\"Whiterun%20Hold\"&gt;Whiterun Hold&lt;/a&gt;. It is said that they met many &lt;a href=\"Mer\"&gt;elves&lt;/a&gt;, but their numbers never faltered, so shrewd were they in battle, with minds as sharp as their blade.\nA scout under Jeek's command, &lt;a href=\"Jonder%20the%20Tiny\"&gt;Jonder the Tiny&lt;/a&gt;, came back with news about a strange monument in the shape of a great bird of prey whose eyes and beak were opened in flame. However, by the time they arrived there were no elves to be seen, despite the vast plain that surrounded it. When asked about the monument, elven captives said that they knew nothing about it except that it had been there for as long as any of them could remember. The monument, which was later called the &lt;a href=\"Skyforge\"&gt;Skyforge&lt;/a&gt;, had stood there long before Mer, so it was an object of fear among their people.\nJeek and his crew were not afraid of elven stories, so it was decided that the strange monument could be of use to them. Aside from serving as a landmark, it was discovered that the edifice on which the monument had been built was hollow and a secret door was set into the base of the outcrop, and inside there was a large basin surrounded by three small pillars. This only deepened the mystery of the Skyforge's origins, but it was soon decided that the small cavern could be used for secret or private meetings. At the base of the monument itself was a large stone pool full of ash and coals that had long since gone cold.\nThe land surrounding the Skyforge was fit for harvest, the soil rich and fertile, and so began the labors of &lt;a href=\"Menro\"&gt;Menro&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Manwe\"&gt;Manwe&lt;/a&gt;, whose eager hands again came to bear on the sturdy &lt;a href=\"Atmora\"&gt;Atmoran&lt;/a&gt; wood which had borne them across the sea, the hull of their beloved vessel becoming their shelter.\nThus began the building of &lt;a href=\"Whiterun\"&gt;Whiterun&lt;/a&gt;, circled by the running of the &lt;a href=\"White%20River\"&gt;White River&lt;/a&gt; to the south and east, as brought forth by these beloved of Ysgramor, yet but twenty-two of the glamorous Five Hundred Companions."}

Jehanna is the closest kingdom in High Rock to &lt;a href=\"Skyrim\"&gt;Skyrim&lt;/a&gt;.\nDescription.\nGeography.\nJehanna is the center of the Kingdom of Jehanna, which is located on the northeasternmost portion of High Rock. Jehanna and the city of &lt;a href=\"Fharun\"&gt;Fharun&lt;/a&gt; are adjacent to each other, both located on the northeastern portion of High Rock. Fharun is located on the summit of a mountain while the city of Jehanna is located on the lower basin, closer to the &lt;a href=\"Sea%20of%20Ghosts\"&gt;Sea of Ghosts&lt;/a&gt;. Jehanna is a port city by heart, having a close proximity to the &lt;a href=\"West%20Skyrim\"&gt;West Skyrim&lt;/a&gt; capital of &lt;a href=\"Solitude\"&gt;Solitude&lt;/a&gt;. Port ships move in between the city of Solitude and the &lt;a href=\"Morkul%20Stronghold\"&gt;Morkul Stronghold&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Central%20Wrothgar\"&gt;Central Wrothgar&lt;/a&gt;, it eventually goes to the city of &lt;a href=\"Northpoint\"&gt;Northpoint&lt;/a&gt;.\nHistory.\n&lt;a href=\"First%20Era\"&gt;First Era&lt;/a&gt;.\nJehanna has historically been part of the &lt;a href=\"Western%20Reach\"&gt;Western Reach&lt;/a&gt;, which was captured and settled by the &lt;a href=\"Nordic%20Empire\"&gt;Nordic Empire&lt;/a&gt; until they were pushed out by the &lt;a href=\"Direnni%20Hegemony\"&gt;Direnni Hegemony&lt;/a&gt;. The Direnni erected many buildings around the province, but after the Hegemony fell, fiefdoms of Breton city-states appeared in the aftermath.\n&lt;a href=\"Second%20Era\"&gt;Second Era&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe city-state of Jehanna was recognized by the people of the &lt;a href=\"Interregnum\"&gt;Interregnum&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"2E%20583\"&gt;2E 583&lt;/a&gt;; in High Rock lore, rituals were performed to imbue white elks with the intelligence of ghosts captured from the frigid seas near Jehanna, turning them into &lt;a href=\"Palefrost%20Elk\"&gt;Palefrost Elk&lt;/a&gt;. Around this time, the &lt;a href=\"Orsimer\"&gt;Orsimer&lt;/a&gt; had primarily settled in the northeast of the province, when the city of &lt;a href=\"Fharun\"&gt;Fharun&lt;/a&gt; was an Orcish stronghold. The road in between Bangkorai and Wrothgar is known as Jehanna Road, implying a connection. A small jetty on the base of &lt;a href=\"Sorrow\"&gt;Mount Sorrow&lt;/a&gt; also shared the name of Jehanna, inhabited by the horkers and &lt;a href=\"Ogre\"&gt;Ogre&lt;/a&gt;s of the Western Reach.\nBy &lt;a href=\"2E%20864\"&gt;2E 864&lt;/a&gt;, Jehanna was marked on maps of Tamriel.\n&lt;a href=\"Third%20Era\"&gt;Third Era&lt;/a&gt;.\nDuring the &lt;a href=\"Imperial%20Simulacrum\"&gt;Imperial Simulacrum&lt;/a&gt; from &lt;a href=\"3E%20389\"&gt;3E 389&lt;/a&gt; to &lt;a href=\"3E%20399\"&gt;3E 399&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Emperor\"&gt;Emperor&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Uriel%20Septim%20VII\"&gt;Uriel Septim VII&lt;/a&gt; was imprisoned along with &lt;a href=\"Talin%20Warhaft\"&gt;Talin Warhaft&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;a href=\"Deadlands\"&gt;Deadlands&lt;/a&gt; by &lt;a href=\"Jagar%20Tharn\"&gt;Jagar Tharn&lt;/a&gt;. Tharn planned for months to capture the throne, and he was able to achieve so in the span of ten years. Tharn had a powerful weapon called the &lt;a href=\"Staff%20of%20Chaos\"&gt;Staff of Chaos&lt;/a&gt;, and he split it into nine pieces and scattered them across Tamriel, the staff was the only thing keeping Uriel Septim and Warhaft in &lt;a href=\"Oblivion\"&gt;Oblivion&lt;/a&gt;. A warrior escaped his clutches and traveled all corners of Tamriel to retrieve the missing pieces. The hero was known as the &lt;a href=\"Eternal%20Champion\"&gt;Eternal Champion&lt;/a&gt;, and he assembled the staff and defeated Jagar Tharn at the &lt;a href=\"Imperial%20Palace\"&gt;Imperial Palace&lt;/a&gt;. The Eternal Champion had at one point visited the city of Jehanna in their quest to recover the pieces. The city of Jehanna was under the rule of &lt;a href=\"King%20Bedyctor\"&gt;King Bedyctor&lt;/a&gt;.\nDuring the Imperial Simulacrum, several conflicts ravaged the provinces, claiming territory and seeking vengeance against their neighbors. One such conflict was the &lt;a href=\"War%20of%20Bend%27r-Mahk\"&gt;War of Bend'r-Mahk&lt;/a&gt;, which occurred all throughout the &lt;a href=\"Western%20Reach\"&gt;Western Reach&lt;/a&gt; and the northern &lt;a href=\"Dragon%27s%20Teeth%20Mountains\"&gt;Dragon's Teeth Mountains&lt;/a&gt;. The &lt;a href=\"Nords\"&gt;Nords&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"Skyrim\"&gt;Skyrim&lt;/a&gt; invaded the provinces west to claim territory they felt was originally theirs, which they had before the &lt;a href=\"War%20of%20Succession\"&gt;War of Succession&lt;/a&gt;. The Nords were able to expand their territory further across the &lt;a href=\"Druadach%20Mountains\"&gt;Druadach Mountains&lt;/a&gt; and into areas such as Wrothgar and &lt;a href=\"Craglorn\"&gt;Craglorn&lt;/a&gt;. The city-state of Jehenna held a large Breton resistance in the war and was a central point of interest in the conflict, same goes with the city of &lt;a href=\"Elinhir\"&gt;Elinhir&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Hammerfell\"&gt;Hammerfell&lt;/a&gt;. The war had reached their height in &lt;a href=\"3E%20397\"&gt;3E 397&lt;/a&gt; when &lt;a href=\"Pergan%20Asuul\"&gt;Pergan Asuul&lt;/a&gt; was defeated along with the &lt;a href=\"Umbra%27%20Keth\"&gt;Umbra' Keth&lt;/a&gt; by the &lt;a href=\"Soul%20of%20Conflict\"&gt;Soul of Conflict&lt;/a&gt;."}

She can be found in &lt;a href=\"The%20Drunken%20Huntsman\"&gt;The Drunken Huntsman&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Whiterun%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Whiterun&lt;/a&gt;.\nFollower.\nJenassa has a lust for killing and advertises her shadowy sensibilities to the &lt;a href=\"Last%20Dragonborn\"&gt;Dragonborn&lt;/a&gt; upon first meeting. She charges the standard 500 fee to recruit. When dismissed, she lingers in The Drunken Huntsman or, if married, the home chosen for her.\nShe has a dark, murderous nature and has no qualms with any similar tendencies present in her employer; she abstains from interfering in any crimes the Dragonborn may commit, and can even be ordered to attack almost anyone, including &lt;a href=\"hold%20guard\"&gt;hold guard&lt;/a&gt;s. However, it should be noted that she will not stop attacking an enemy, even if the Dragonborn and the hostile character have sheathed their weapons. This can earn the Dragonborn a large bounty.\nShe can be recruited into the &lt;a href=\"Blades%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Blades&lt;/a&gt; during the quest \"&lt;a href=\"Rebuilding%20the%20Blades\"&gt;Rebuilding the Blades&lt;/a&gt;\" and is also a potential &lt;a href=\"Marriage%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;marriage&lt;/a&gt; candidate but cannot become a &lt;a href=\"Steward%20%28Hearthfire%29\"&gt;steward&lt;/a&gt;. Both waive any subsequent recruitment fees; she must, however, be hired once before marriage or Blades recruitment becomes an option.\nSkills.\nJenassa is skilled in &lt;a href=\"Archery%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Archery&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Light%20Armor%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Light Armor&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"One-Handed%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;One-Handed&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Block%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Block&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Sneak%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Sneak&lt;/a&gt;. She can use Bows, Shields with One-Handed weapons and Light Armor quite effectively.\nShe possesses no magical abilities. She can wear both &lt;a href=\"Heavy%20Armor%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;heavy armor&lt;/a&gt; and light armor but prefers the latter. She equips heavy armor only if no stronger light armor appears in her inventory. She also seems to prefer equipping a heavy armor helmet rather than a light armor helmet.\nWeapons.\nShe equips the &lt;a href=\"Weapons%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;weapon&lt;/a&gt; with the highest base damage for &lt;a href=\"melee\"&gt;melee&lt;/a&gt;, although when working with two weapons with the same base damage, she seems to take into account the power of any enchantments placed on them.\nJenassa will naturally dual wield any two weapons given to her, without the need to first equip her with a pickaxe, as is the case with most other followers. She is one of few followers who &lt;a href=\"Dual%20Wielding\"&gt;dual wields&lt;/a&gt; weapons as a first choice in combat, along with &lt;a href=\"Frea\"&gt;Frea&lt;/a&gt; , &lt;a href=\"Ria\"&gt;Ria&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Rayya\"&gt;Rayya&lt;/a&gt;.\nLike other followers that use bows, she will pick up stray arrows and use them. She can equip most types of arrows, although she only requires one of them to have an endless supply (only when using her own bow and not one given to her). She will also use a &lt;a href=\"Staves%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;staff&lt;/a&gt;, and can dual wield with them.\nMarriage.\nJenassa is a possible marriage candidate. When married, Jenassa opens a &lt;a href=\"Merchants%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;shop&lt;/a&gt; and will give the Dragonborn a profit of 100 a day, which adds up every day if it is not collected. She can be both a follower and a spouse simultaneously.\nQuotes.\nDwemer related.\nJenassa also makes observations and comments about the &lt;a href=\"Dwemer\"&gt;Dwemer&lt;/a&gt; whilst in their ruins."}

He tells them to craft a ring, and to start by gathering the necessary materials.\nIf the Vestige's Jewelry Crafting skill is already 10 or higher, they tell Felarian that they already know the basics. Sensing the Vestige's skill, Felarian decides that a demonstration will not be necessary and certifies them in the art of jewelry crafting, thereby completing the quest.\nOtherwise, Felarian tells the Vestige to acquire 10 Pewter Dust, which can be obtained from pewter seams just west of the city. When they return with the Pewter Dust, Felarian says the next step is to acquire Pewter Ounces, by either refining the Pewter Dust at a jewelry crafting station, getting it from a friend, or buying it from a guild store. After returning with the Pewter Ounces, the Vestige is told to create a Pewter Ring at a jewelry crafting station. After showing the ring to Felarian, the final task is to deconstruct it at a jewelry crafting station.\nAfter the Vestige crafts and deconstructs a ring, Felarian certifies them in the art of jewelry crafting."}

But after spending some time in the stifling heat of the &lt;a href=\"Alik%27r%20Desert%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Alik'r&lt;/a&gt;, I can tell you that they skillfully cut more than just dunerippers and grave robbers. I'm speaking, of course, about precious stones!\nDuring my most recent visit to &lt;a href=\"Sentinel%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Sentinel&lt;/a&gt;, I had the opportunity to speak with a clever jeweler-historian named &lt;a href=\"Berzhalan\"&gt;Berzhalan&lt;/a&gt;. According to him, the hills of &lt;a href=\"Yokuda\"&gt;Yokuda&lt;/a&gt; (the Redguards' long-lost home), were filled with nests of volcanic geodes and jewels. The ancient Yokudans mined up topaz, sapphires, amethysts, and opals\u2014placing great value on any stone with rich color or creamy luster. (Diamonds, shockingly enough, were often discarded due to their lack of hue!)\nIn addition to creating wide necklaces and heavy bangles, the Yokudans used these gems to adorn their most prized possessions: family swords. They studded the pommels, scabbards, crossguards (and even the blades!) with finely-cut jewels. Over time, this practice fell out of favor. The near-constant civil wars of the &lt;a href=\"Yokeda\"&gt;Yokeda&lt;/a&gt; forced the Redguards, more often than not, to choose utility over beauty. Nonetheless, the gem-cutting tradition remained strong. Yokudan jewelers turned their focus from the martial to the glamorous, crafting elaborate opal headdresses, jangling sapphire anklets, and wide amethyst rings. When the time came for the &lt;a href=\"Ra%20Gada\"&gt;Ra Gada&lt;/a&gt; invasions, these craftsmen brought their skills and traditions to &lt;a href=\"Tamriel\"&gt;Tamriel&lt;/a&gt;. I was surprised to learn that the tools and methods of Redguard jewelers have remained largely unchanged ever since.\nSo if you ever make your way to Alik'r, do yourself a favor and buy a jeweled Redguard knife or a Totambu-style ring. True, you'll never have the opportunity to see the rolling hills of Yokuda. But these treasures can take you there in spirit, "}

There are still those among us that enjoy scholarly pursuits and the broadening of our minds. Perhaps we are but a token few these days, but hope is not lost. Nords must remember that they are called to a higher purpose than the brandishing of swords. We should be pursuing matters that enrich our lives, not risk them.

There are many Nords who feel the same way. Jhunal wavers in favor because of a foolish notion that the pursuit of knowledge is somehow beneath us. That anything that doesn't make us stronger or display our courage for everyone to see is worthless. But I beseech you to abandon those notions. They have been learned, which means they can be unlearned. We need not do away with our strength as warriors in order to bolster our minds. In fact, doing both in conjunction can only improve both aspects of our beings.\nTo be an excellent warrior, you must also have a strong mind and the knowledge to carry you through battle, wouldn't you agree? If the importance of learning is not enough to entice you, let that be your motivation instead. Jhunal is still ours, and Skyrim is still a land of warriors who are enriched by knowledge as well as combat.\nDo not turn up your nose at such pursuits! If we turn a blind eye to Jhunal and his teachings, then we are doomed as a people."}

Killing was always high in demand in his homeland of &lt;a href=\"Morrowind\"&gt;Morrowind&lt;/a&gt;, and so he worked as a low-grade killer for hire to support his &lt;a href=\"Skooma\"&gt;Skooma&lt;/a&gt; addiction. It was a decision that led to his eventual capture and imprisonment.\nImprisonment.\nJiub was sent to prison after a failed assassination on a high-ranking official of &lt;a href=\"House%20Redoran\"&gt;House Redoran&lt;/a&gt;. A rival assassin from the legally sanctioned assassin guild known as the &lt;a href=\"Morag%20Tong\"&gt;Morag Tong&lt;/a&gt; reached Jiub's target first and alerted the local guards to cover his tracks. Jiub was later sent to jail in the city of &lt;a href=\"Vivec%20City\"&gt;Vivec&lt;/a&gt; after being found guilty in his trial.\nNew purpose.\nAfter his release in &lt;a href=\"3E%20427\"&gt;3E 427&lt;/a&gt;, he was transported by ship alongside the &lt;a href=\"Nerevarine\"&gt;Nerevarine&lt;/a&gt; from the &lt;a href=\"Imperial%20City\"&gt;Imperial City&lt;/a&gt; to Vvardenfell, Morrowind. It was during this time that he decided to turn his life around to seek redemption for his crimes. He felt obligated to give something back to the people of Morrowind, so he decided to undertake a crusade against the Cliff Racers who plagued his homeland.\nThe Eradicator.\nAtop a &lt;a href=\"Silt%20Strider\"&gt;Silt Strider&lt;/a&gt;, Jiub traveled the &lt;a href=\"Ashlands\"&gt;Ashlands&lt;/a&gt;, hunting and killing many Cliff Racers. On one instance of hunting, Jiub followed a stray Cliff Racer, which led him to an entire nest of them. The battle lasted two full days, with Jiub the victor over seventy-six Cliff Racers. Afterwards, he collapsed into a dark sleep.\nSainthood.\nJiub awoke in the &lt;a href=\"Palace%20of%20Vivec\"&gt;Palace of Vivec&lt;/a&gt; in front of &lt;a href=\"Vivec\"&gt;Vivec&lt;/a&gt; himself, who had admired his virtue and rescued him from death. Vivec canonized Jiub and he was known as a great hero throughout Morrowind and was earned many titles. A fair known as &lt;a href=\"Saint%20Jiub%27s%20Fair\"&gt;Saint Jiub's Fair&lt;/a&gt; began in honor of him and was celebrated in many places, including &lt;a href=\"Cheydinhal\"&gt;Cheydinhal&lt;/a&gt;.\nLater life and death.\nJiub later moved to the city of Kvatch in &lt;a href=\"Cyrodiil\"&gt;Cyrodiil&lt;/a&gt; to focus on the writing of his autobiography. It was during this time when the &lt;a href=\"Oblivion%20Crisis\"&gt;Oblivion Crisis&lt;/a&gt; occurred in &lt;a href=\"3E%20433\"&gt;3E 433&lt;/a&gt; and Kvatch was invaded by &lt;a href=\"Mehrunes%20Dagon\"&gt;Mehrunes Dagon&lt;/a&gt;. Jiub, who was writing in his home at the time, was soul trapped by a Dremora and was sent to the &lt;a href=\"Soul%20Cairn\"&gt;Soul Cairn&lt;/a&gt; to wander for eternity. Many people assumed that Jiub had perished in Morrowind during the crisis, while Jiub thought that he was just imprisoned by the &lt;a href=\"Daedra\"&gt;Daedra&lt;/a&gt;.\nMeeting with the Dragonborn.\nIn &lt;a href=\"4E%20201\"&gt;4E 201&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"Last%20Dragonborn\"&gt;Last Dragonborn&lt;/a&gt; encountered Jiub while in the &lt;a href=\"Soul%20Cairn\"&gt;Soul Cairn&lt;/a&gt;. The Dragonborn made Jiub realize that he was dead, and so was tasked with &lt;a href=\"Impatience%20of%20a%20Saint\"&gt;finding the lost pages of his opus&lt;/a&gt; so that it may be returned to &lt;a href=\"Tamriel\"&gt;Tamriel&lt;/a&gt;.

The priests of Shadow Dance Temple knew how to cause an eclipse and &lt;a href=\"Anequina%20Sharp-Tongue\"&gt;Anequina Sharp-Tongue&lt;/a&gt; had done it once as part of a plan to trick the dragons. &lt;a href=\"Cadwell%20the%20Betrayer%20%28Character%29\"&gt;Cadwell the Betrayer&lt;/a&gt; did it again years later, but to help the dragons. \nHistory.\nDuring the &lt;a href=\"Merethic%20Era\"&gt;Merethic Era&lt;/a&gt;, the Dragon-Lord, &lt;a href=\"Kaalgrontiid%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Kaalgrontiid&lt;/a&gt;, coveted the lunar power of Jode's Core. To stop them, the &lt;a href=\"Khajiit\"&gt;Khajiit&lt;/a&gt; hero &lt;a href=\"Khunzar-ri\"&gt;Khunzar-ri&lt;/a&gt; recruited four companions: &lt;a href=\"Nurarion%20the%20Perfect\"&gt;Nurarion the Perfect&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Flinthild%20Demon-Hunter\"&gt;Flinthild Demon-Hunter&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Anequina%20Sharp-Tongue\"&gt;Anequina Sharp-Tongue&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Cadwell\"&gt;Cadwell the Betrayer&lt;/a&gt;. When fighting them proved to be futile, Cadwell came up with the plan of fooling the dragons into storing their power within Jode's Core. \nDriven by ambition, Kaalgrontiid agreed to the plan and commanded his brothers to do the same. Once the dragons were weakened, Khunzar-ri sealed them away within the &lt;a href=\"Halls%20of%20Colossus\"&gt;Halls of Colossus&lt;/a&gt;. Unfortunately, Cadwell turned traitor and attempted to seize the power of Jode's Core for himself. He ultimately failed and was dismembered, his body parts scattered. \nIn 2E 582, &lt;a href=\"Abnur%20Tharn\"&gt;Abnur Tharn&lt;/a&gt; accidentally freed the dragons from their imprisonment. The dragons resumed their original plan of acquiring power from Jode's Core. They eventually managed to enter the Plane of Jode, where Kaalgrontiid began consuming the Core. The &lt;a href=\"Vestige\"&gt;Vestige&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Khamira%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Khamira&lt;/a&gt; were able to banish Kaalgrontiid from the Plane from he was able to fully absorb the lunar power.

On the ground, an assortment of weapons and armor of the &lt;a href=\"Daedra\"&gt;Daedra&lt;/a&gt; known as &lt;a href=\"Golden%20Saints\"&gt;Golden Saints&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Dark%20Seducers\"&gt;Dark Seducers&lt;/a&gt; laid strewn about. It is from this site that we took up their arms, and joined together as bandit companies under their names. Since then, as the only blacksmith, I have taken it upon myself to study these otherworldly artifacts.\nAnd now, at last, my efforts to reproduce the exquisite craftsmanship of these great Daedra has finally born fruit.\nMy mind is not what it once was. If my memory fails me, at least these notes can help the others keep the craft alive.\nOne would be foolish to forge weapons from gold, as it is far too soft. And yet the golden blades of the Saints are nimble and harder than steel. How could this be? The trick appears to be three fold: First, the structure of the piece must be reinforced with refined moonstone. Second, the gold must be hammered into place while the gold is heated just below its melting point. Third, the introduction of the heart of a Daedra to the forge when heating the piece so it can be hammered into shape completely transforms the attributes of the metal, giving it its uncanny hardness.\nThe process for forging the dark armor of the Seducers is similar, but requires more finesse, as you must balance shaping the unyielding ebony with malleable quicksilver. The heat applied must be very precise or the shape and integrity of the equipment will be ruined. As before, introduce the Daedric heart to the forge as you heat the material."}

In &lt;a href=\"1E%20948\"&gt;1E 948&lt;/a&gt;, he sent a letter to &lt;a href=\"Gaiden%20Shinji\"&gt;Gaiden Shinji&lt;/a&gt; saying: \"\"The &lt;a href=\"Orsimer\"&gt;orcs&lt;/a&gt; have been much plaguing the &lt;a href=\"Wayrest\"&gt;Wayrest&lt;/a&gt;ers and impeding traffic to the heart of the land.\"\" Two years later, the &lt;a href=\"Siege%20of%20Orsinium\"&gt;Siege of Orsinium&lt;/a&gt; began.\nSiege of Orsinium.\nJoile was responsible for leading his forces and the &lt;a href=\"Knights%20of%20the%20Dragon\"&gt;Knights of the Dragon&lt;/a&gt; during the &lt;a href=\"Siege%20of%20Orsinium\"&gt;Siege of Orsinium&lt;/a&gt;. He also convinced the forces of &lt;a href=\"Sentinel\"&gt;Sentinel&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Order%20of%20Diagna\"&gt;Order of Diagna&lt;/a&gt; to ally with him and lead the charge into the city. A few years into the siege, Joile placed &lt;a href=\"General%20Mercedene\"&gt;General Mercedene&lt;/a&gt;, the leader of the &lt;a href=\"Winterborn%20%28Faction%29\"&gt;Winterborn&lt;/a&gt;, in command of his forces.\nJoile then commanded &lt;a href=\"Lord%20Trystan\"&gt;Lord Trystan&lt;/a&gt;, the leader of the Knights, to have Gaiden Shinji agree to a duel Orcish hero &lt;a href=\"Baloth%20Bloodtusk\"&gt;Baloth Bloodtusk&lt;/a&gt;. Joile threatened Shinji that if he didn't accept, he would have Lord Trystan in his place. He later captured &lt;a href=\"Rokaug\"&gt;Rokaug&lt;/a&gt;, the brother of Baloth, and manipulated Baloth into siding with King &lt;a href=\"Golkarr\"&gt;Golkarr&lt;/a&gt;, with the lie that his brother died at Mercedene's forces. Baloth agreed to duel Shinji, and at the grounds of Orsinium Shinji and Baloth fought one another for minutes without end.\nIt was later discovered that Joile had actually set up the duel as a means to get rid of Orsinium and Hammerfell's greatest warriors, and had &lt;a href=\"Joile%27s%20Archer\"&gt;his archers&lt;/a&gt; assassinate them both under Mercedene's supervision. Joile told Mercedene to keep Lord Trystan alive, as he needed him for his planned invasion of Hammerfell. Trystan found out about Joile's treachery, and pulled out the Knights from participating further in the siege.\nInvading Hammerfell.\nAfter years of planning, Joile finally executed his plan to invade Hammerfell in &lt;a href=\"1E%20973\"&gt;1E 973&lt;/a&gt;. During the &lt;a href=\"Battle%20of%20Bangkorai%20Pass\"&gt;Battle of Bangkorai Pass&lt;/a&gt;, Joile's army fought with the guardians of &lt;a href=\"Bangkorai%20Pass\"&gt;the pass&lt;/a&gt; and defeated most of them. However, their leader &lt;a href=\"Makela%20Leki\"&gt;Makela Leki&lt;/a&gt;, slashed through his soldiers, and delivered a blow that broke Joile's armor. She then struck his head with her sword, killing him, and causing his army to retreat.\nInteractions.\n&lt;a href=\"March%20of%20the%20Ra%20Gada\"&gt;March of the Ra Gada&lt;/a&gt;.\nCollect Breton ghost essence and use the shrine to reenact the slaying of King Joile."}

Upon entering the Palace, Ulfric and Galmar will be in a heated discussion about the ongoing &lt;a href=\"Civil%20War\"&gt;Civil War&lt;/a&gt; discussion shown below:\nAfter speaking to Ulfric, he tells the Dragonborn to speak to &lt;a href=\"Galmar%20Stone-Fist\"&gt;Galmar Stone-Fist&lt;/a&gt;.

Vulkhel Guard is not as luxurious or city-esque as the other cities in Auridon, but considering the location, Vulkhel Guard is an extremely significant port, connecting the &lt;a href=\"Cape%20of%20the%20Blue%20Divide\"&gt;Cape of the Blue Divide&lt;/a&gt; in the south, with the rest of Auridon.\nDescription.\nGeography.\nUnlike the other cities on Auridon, Vulkhel Guard is the lowest regarding geography, closer to sea-level than Firsthold, which towers over the ocean. The dockyards of Vulkhel Guard span across the Bay, capable of holding substantial warships and cargo carriers. The beaches on Vulkhel house various stalls and caravans, continuing onto the isolated beaches underneath the castle overlooking nearby &lt;a href=\"Silsailen\"&gt;Silsailen&lt;/a&gt;. Continuing north from the beach would lead to the road going towards the rest of Auridon. In between are several residential homes and the &lt;a href=\"Mara%27s%20Kiss%20Public%20House\"&gt;Mara's Kiss Public House&lt;/a&gt;. These buildings are in the eastern town square. West from there will lead into Inner Vulkhel Guard, which is protected with walls, likely from invading forces. There are only two buildings here, the &lt;a href=\"Temple%20of%20Auri-El\"&gt;Temple of Auri-El&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Vulkhel%20Guard%20Manor%20%26amp%3B%20Treasury\"&gt;Vulkhel Guard Manor &amp; Treasury&lt;/a&gt;, the seat of power in the area. Continuing west will lead into the busiest places in town. The western town square has the local forge in the center, including several artisans surrounding it. The local guilds are situated here as well. There is a road in the south that connects the docks to this area. There is another path in between the two guildhalls that leads to the beaches near &lt;a href=\"South%20Beacon\"&gt;South Beacon&lt;/a&gt;.\nHistory.\n&lt;a href=\"Second%20Era\"&gt;Second Era&lt;/a&gt;.\nDuring the &lt;a href=\"Interregnum\"&gt;Interregnum&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"2E%20582\"&gt;2E 582&lt;/a&gt;, the city-state of Vulkhel Guard was under the control of &lt;a href=\"Canonreeve%20Nesaranwe\"&gt;Canonreeve Nesaranwe&lt;/a&gt;, who prepared Vulkhel Guard for the arrival of &lt;a href=\"Queen%20Ayrenn\"&gt;Queen Ayrenn&lt;/a&gt;. The one who had recently assumed the &lt;a href=\"Throne%20of%20Alinor\"&gt;Throne of Alinor&lt;/a&gt; as the High Queen of the Summerset Isles. The high-ranking officials of Auridon traveled to Vulkhel Guard to greet the new Queen, which included &lt;a href=\"High%20Kinlord%20Rilis%20XIII\"&gt;High Kinlord Rilis XIII&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"Firsthold\"&gt;Firsthold&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"High%20Kinlady%20Estre\"&gt;High Kinlady Estre&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"Skywatch\"&gt;Skywatch&lt;/a&gt;. During her stay in Vulkhel Guard, several suspicious activities had begun to arrive, prompting the &lt;a href=\"Eyes%20of%20the%20Queen\"&gt;Eyes of the Queen&lt;/a&gt; to step in and investigate. Around the same time, an &lt;a href=\"Vestige\"&gt;estranged warrior&lt;/a&gt; arrived onto Vulkhel Guard and agreed to help &lt;a href=\"Advisor%20Norion\"&gt;Advisor Norion&lt;/a&gt; with these activities. Eventually, the warrior discovered the &lt;a href=\"Veiled%20Heritance\"&gt;Veiled Heritance&lt;/a&gt; in Vulkhel Guard and that &lt;a href=\"Watch%20Captain%20Astanya\"&gt;Watch Captain Astanya&lt;/a&gt; was planning an assassination attempt on Ayrenn at the Temple of Auri-El. In the end, the warrior defeated the assassin and was named an elite agent for Ayrenn. The Queen continued into Auridon, to the ruins of &lt;a href=\"Tanzelwil\"&gt;Tanzelwil&lt;/a&gt;.\n&lt;a href=\"Third%20Era\"&gt;Third Era&lt;/a&gt;.\nDuring the &lt;a href=\"Imperial%20Simulacrum\"&gt;Imperial Simulacrum&lt;/a&gt; from &lt;a href=\"3E%20389\"&gt;3E 389&lt;/a&gt; to &lt;a href=\"3E%20399\"&gt;3E 399&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Emperor\"&gt;Emperor&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Uriel%20Septim%20VII\"&gt;Uriel Septim VII&lt;/a&gt; was imprisoned along with &lt;a href=\"Talin%20Warhaft\"&gt;Talin Warhaft&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;a href=\"Deadlands\"&gt;Deadlands&lt;/a&gt; by &lt;a href=\"Jagar%20Tharn\"&gt;Jagar Tharn&lt;/a&gt;. Tharn planned for months to capture the throne, and he was able to achieve so in the span of ten years. Tharn had a powerful weapon called the &lt;a href=\"Staff%20of%20Chaos\"&gt;Staff of Chaos&lt;/a&gt;, and he split it into nine pieces and scattered them across Tamriel, the staff was the only thing keeping Uriel Septim and Warhaft in &lt;a href=\"Oblivion\"&gt;Oblivion&lt;/a&gt;. A warrior escaped his clutches and traveled all corners of Tamriel to retrieve the missing pieces. The hero was known as the &lt;a href=\"Eternal%20Champion\"&gt;Eternal Champion&lt;/a&gt;, and he assembled the staff and defeated Jagar Tharn at the &lt;a href=\"Imperial%20Palace\"&gt;Imperial Palace&lt;/a&gt;. The Eternal Champion had at one point visited the town of Vulkhel Guard in their quest to recover the pieces."}

Huh?\"\nAlexia: \"Why that's not the same thing at all. The Dominion were invaders. Conquerors. We had to fight them, to preserve our own way of life.\"\nVulwulf: \"My point exactly.\"\nAsgeir Snow-Shod.\nVulwulf: \"Drink up, my boy! Drink to those who have fallen! May their souls find their way to Sovngarde!\"\nAsgeir: \"Take it easy, father. You're making a scene.\"\nVulwulf: \"I'll rest easy when we've driven every last Imperial pig back across the Jerall Mountains!\"\nVulwulf: \"Now, do me the honor I deserve as your father and drink up!\"\nAsgeir: \"Yes... father.\"\nAsgeir: \"I'm sorry you disapprove, father. But I've made up my mind. I'm not a warrior, I'm a businessman.\"\nVulwulf: \"The only reason you have the gold for your 'business' is because I gave it to you.\"\nAsgeir: \"I'll pay you back, if it means that much.\"\nVulwulf: \"It's not about the coin, it's about honoring your legacy by picking up arms and keeping this land free. The sooner you remember that, the better.\"\nMaven Black-Briar.\nVulwulf: \"Maven! So good to see you again. Hoist a flagon and celebrate with me!\"\nMaven: \"Vulwulf, it's always a pleasure. When you're standing downwind of me.\"\nVulwulf: \"Sorry, what was that?\"\nMaven: \"Nothing Vulwulf... cheers.\"\nMaven: \"I'm telling you, Vulwulf, it's the investment you've been waiting for.\"\nVulwulf: \"So I pay for the weapon shipments and you oversee their distribution to the Stormcloaks?\"\nMaven: \"Exactly. What better way to help the cause than to put weapons into the hands of young Nord warriors dying for their homeland?\"\nVulwulf: \"Shor's Beard! You're right! I'll do it... provided you supervise the shipments personally.\"\nMaven: \"Don't worry, I'll treat those shipments as if I owned them myself.\"\nNura Snow-Shod.\nNura: \"You need to be easier on Asgeir. All he wants to do is please you.\"\nVulwulf: \"It would please me if he'd take up arms and fight to save his homeland. Is that too much to ask my own son?\"\nNura: \"That's right. He is your son. He has his own hopes and dreams and we have no right to tell him otherwise.\"\nVulwulf: \"You can't deny the fact that he needs to give back to his people, to fight to keep us free. You healed the wounded, Nura. You saw their life's blood spilling into the mud, giving back to the land. No, I'm sorry, I've worked too damn hard to let his life go to waste.\"\nAsgeir &amp; Nura Snow-Shod.\nNura: \"How are things at the Meadery, my dear?\"\nVulwulf: \"Not this again...\"\nNura: \"Hush, Vulwulf... let the boy speak.\"\nAsgeir: \"It's going very well, actually. The war hasn't even slowed down our production or shipping at all.\"\nVulwulf: \"Of course it is. That's what happens when you're partners with a corrupt Imperial whore like Maven.\"\nNura: \"Vulwulf! The Empire may be our enemy, but Asgeir is still our son and we're a long way from Cyrodiil.\"\nAsgeir: \"Father, I promise you, this has nothing to do with Empires or politics. It's just business.\"\nVulwulf: \"It has everything to do with politics. Asgeir my son, you have so much to learn.\"\nTalen-Jei.\nVulwulf: \"Talen! Another round!\"\nTalen-Jei: \"I think you've had plenty, Vulwulf. Maybe you should head on home.\"\nVulwulf: \"You stupid lizard! I said give me some more drink, or I'll have your head on a pike!\"\nTalen-Jei: \"Suit yourself.\""}

{"id": "1539", "revid": "32911304", "url": "https://elderscrolls.fandom.com/wiki?curid=1539", "title": "Vvardenfell", "text": "Vvardenfell, also known as the Black Isle, is a very large island inside the crescent-shaped lands of the &lt;a href=\"province\"&gt;province&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"Morrowind\"&gt;Morrowind&lt;/a&gt;, located in the &lt;a href=\"Inner%20Sea\"&gt;Inner Sea&lt;/a&gt; in the north-eastern part of &lt;a href=\"Tamriel\"&gt;Tamriel&lt;/a&gt;. It has been inhabited by the &lt;a href=\"Aldmer\"&gt;Aldmer&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Dwemer\"&gt;Dwemer&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Chimer\"&gt;Chimer&lt;/a&gt;, and most prominently the &lt;a href=\"Dunmer\"&gt;Dunmer&lt;/a&gt; throughout its course of history. Vvardenfell is the primary setting of and .\nOne of the most outstanding landmarks of the island is &lt;a href=\"Red%20Mountain\"&gt;Red Mountain&lt;/a&gt;, a volcano located at its heart that continuously shoots ash into the skies. This has led to the large stretches of barren and inhospitable &lt;a href=\"Ashlands\"&gt;Ashlands&lt;/a&gt;, where lava flows and ashstorms are common, as can be witnessed in &lt;a href=\"Molag%20Amur\"&gt;Molag Amur&lt;/a&gt;. These storms were also a source of the &lt;a href=\"Blight\"&gt;Blight&lt;/a&gt; disease, until the events of \"Morrowind\".\nIn the &lt;a href=\"Third%20Era\"&gt;Third Era&lt;/a&gt;, in all directions around &lt;a href=\"Red%20Mountain%20Region\"&gt;Red Mountain Region&lt;/a&gt; were a variety of ecosystems, home to a large number of unique plants and creatures, as well as numerous settlements. The political climate was just as varied, with the &lt;a href=\"Great%20Houses\"&gt;Great Houses&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"Empire\"&gt;Empire&lt;/a&gt;, and the &lt;a href=\"Tribunal%20Temple\"&gt;Tribunal Temple&lt;/a&gt;, among others, all coexisting and competing for influence. Major cities of Vvardenfell included &lt;a href=\"Vivec%20City\"&gt;Vivec City&lt;/a&gt;, former home of the &lt;a href=\"Vivec%2C%20Temple%20Canton\"&gt;Temple of Vivec&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Ministry%20of%20Truth\"&gt;Ministry of Truth&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Balmora\"&gt;Balmora&lt;/a&gt;, seat of &lt;a href=\"House%20Hlaalu\"&gt;House Hlaalu&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Ald%27ruhn\"&gt;Ald'ruhn&lt;/a&gt;, seat of &lt;a href=\"House%20Redoran\"&gt;House Redoran&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Sadrith%20Mora\"&gt;Sadrith Mora&lt;/a&gt;, seat of &lt;a href=\"House%20Telvanni\"&gt;House Telvanni&lt;/a&gt;. However, by the early &lt;a href=\"Fourth%20Era\"&gt;Fourth Era&lt;/a&gt;, much of Vvardenfell had been reduced to ash wastes.\nRegions.\nThe island of Vvardenfell is divided into nine separate regions, each with its own distinct climate, geography and ecology.\nThe Ascadian Isles.\nThe Ascadian Isles are the fertile, green lowlands on the south-southwestern corner of Vvardenfell. Settlements include &lt;a href=\"Vivec%20City\"&gt;Vivec&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Ebonheart%20%28Morrowind%29\"&gt;Ebonheart&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Pelagiad\"&gt;Pelagiad&lt;/a&gt;. The large &lt;a href=\"Daedric%20Ruins\"&gt;Daedric ruins&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"Ald%20Sotha%20%28Morrowind%29\"&gt;Ald Sotha&lt;/a&gt; lie to the north of Vivec. Most of Vvardenfell's farms and plantations are in this region. These typically include &lt;a href=\"Netch\"&gt;Netch&lt;/a&gt; herding and agriculture. Plants that commonly grow in this region include heather, willow flowers, stoneflowers, gold kanet flowers, black anther plants, comberry, corkbulbs, saltrice, ash yams and marshmerrow. &lt;a href=\"Slavery\"&gt;Slavery&lt;/a&gt; is common in this area, especially on the plantations.\nThe Ashlands.\nThe Ashlands are the dry and inhospitable areas surrounding &lt;a href=\"Red%20Mountain\"&gt;Red Mountain&lt;/a&gt; to the north and west. Various &lt;a href=\"Dunmer\"&gt;Dunmer&lt;/a&gt; tribes inhabit the region, and the &lt;a href=\"House%20Redoran\"&gt;Redoran&lt;/a&gt; seat of &lt;a href=\"Ald%27ruhn\"&gt;Ald'ruhn&lt;/a&gt; is near the western edge. The Ashlands are inhospitable to most life, but some creatures have managed to adapt to the harsh terrain and climate. These include mainly Guar, Nix hounds, Cliff racers, and Alit. Some plants, like the Trama Root, manage to flourish in this desolate area. Nomads known as Ashlanders also call this region home. Hazardous ashstorms are frequent due to Red Mountain's volcanic activity. &lt;a href=\"Blight\"&gt;Blight&lt;/a&gt; is common in this region.\nAzura's Coast.\nAzura's Coast is the long, rugged and mostly uninhabited coastline and islands of Vvardenfell's east and southeast. It is a wet and rocky area devoid of trees, only low-lying and hardy vegetation is able to exist here. The area, historically uninhabited, has seen a drastic increase in population since the opening of Vvardenfell. Most of Azura's Coast fell within the jurisdiction of &lt;a href=\"House%20Telvanni\"&gt;House Telvanni&lt;/a&gt;, and they have established several settlements including Tel Branora to the south; Tel Aruhn, &lt;a href=\"Tel%20Fyr\"&gt;Tel Fyr&lt;/a&gt;, and the house seat of &lt;a href=\"Sadrith%20Mora\"&gt;Sadrith Mora&lt;/a&gt;, within Zafirbel Bay; and Tel Mora, near the junction of Azura's Coast and the greater Sheogorad archipelago.\nThe Bitter Coast.\nThe Bitter Coast is the humid southwestern coast of Vvardenfell, so-named because of the area's salt marshes and swamps. It is also known as the Smuggler's Coast, due to the rampant smuggling that goes on in this area. &lt;a href=\"Seyda%20Neen\"&gt;Seyda Neen&lt;/a&gt;, Hla Oad, and Gnaar Mok are the only settlements in the region. The area is lush with tall trees, rich plant life, and rare fungus. Plants and fungi that grow here include violet coprinus, luminous russula, bungler's bane, hypa facia, slough fern, and occasionally hackle-lo. There are several shipwrecks in the area, a result of the coast's infamous fog and bad weather. Numerous small islands dot the coast as well as several grottos.\nThe Grazelands.\nThe Grazelands are plains that cover the majority of the northeastern coast of the island and are so named because of the Ashlander herds that graze there. It is largely uninhabited, except for the settlement in &lt;a href=\"Vos\"&gt;Vos&lt;/a&gt; village, as well as the wizard tower of &lt;a href=\"Tel%20Vos\"&gt;Tel Vos&lt;/a&gt;. The Ahemmusa and Zainab Ashlander tribes also have settlements in the region.\nMolag Amur.\nThe region located between the Ashlands and Azura's Coast is Molag Amur. It is a desolate expanse of lava flows, ravines, and fields of ash. Travel is difficult, and ashstorms frequently strike the area. Parts of the region are considered impassable, even by the ashlanders. The stronghold of &lt;a href=\"Molag%20Mar%20%28Morrowind%29\"&gt;Molag Mar&lt;/a&gt;, Erabenimsun camp, and the pilgrimage sites at Mount Assarnibibi and Mount Kand are the only inhabited sites. Molag Amur consists almost entirely of a confusing maze of foyadas. The dangers of Molag Amur are considerable; it is one of the areas most likely to be stricken by ash storms, and is a prime habitat of such creatures as cliff racers, shalks, and other hardy creatures such as alit. Due to this, and its winding labyrinthine passages, travellers can easily get lost or come under attack.\nThe West Gash.\nThe western highlands stretching from the Sea of Ghosts to the city of &lt;a href=\"Balmora\"&gt;Balmora&lt;/a&gt; is called The West Gash. The Hlaalu district seat of Balmora is here, as is the Imperial town of &lt;a href=\"Caldera\"&gt;Caldera&lt;/a&gt;, the mining village of &lt;a href=\"Gnisis\"&gt;Gnisis&lt;/a&gt;, and the fishing villages of &lt;a href=\"Ald%20Velothi\"&gt;Ald Velothi&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Khuul\"&gt;Khuul&lt;/a&gt;. Vegetation in the region is sparse, but hardy. Common plants are kreshweed, roobrush and chokeweed.\nSheogorad.\nThe large island of Sheogorad is on the northern tip of Vvardenfell, and due to its rugged terrain and hostile creatures, it is largely uninhabited, except for the small villages of &lt;a href=\"Dagon%20Fel\"&gt;Dagon Fel&lt;/a&gt; and Ald Redaynia. The population is mostly composed of Nords, who claim to have settled here even before the Chimers claimed Morrowind. Numerous ruins dot the landscape, and there are several daedric and &lt;a href=\"Dwemer%20Ruins\"&gt;Dwemer ruins&lt;/a&gt; in the area. The region is named after &lt;a href=\"Sheogorath\"&gt;Sheogorath&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"Daedric%20Princes\"&gt;Daedric Prince&lt;/a&gt; of Madness.\nRed Mountain Region.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Red%20Mountain\"&gt;Red Mountain&lt;/a&gt; is the central, defining feature of Vvardenfell. It is a giant volcano, steep and rugged, from which ash storms continually issue. Surrounding the mountain is the magical &lt;a href=\"Ghostfence\"&gt;Ghostfence&lt;/a&gt;, which fences in the many &lt;a href=\"Daedra\"&gt;demon&lt;/a&gt; of the region, and filters out the disease-laden \"blight\" which issues from the crater. The only official entrance is at the fortified outpost of &lt;a href=\"Ghostgate\"&gt;Ghostgate&lt;/a&gt;, in which &lt;a href=\"pilgrim\"&gt;pilgrim&lt;/a&gt;s, as well as the &lt;a href=\"Buoyant%20Armigers%20%28Morrowind%29\"&gt;Buoyant Armigers&lt;/a&gt;, reside. In addition, an ebony mine burrows beneath the eastern portion of the Ghostfence and opens out onto the slopes of Red Mountain. Numerous Dwemer ruins dot its slopes, and &lt;a href=\"Dagoth%20Ur%20%28Character%29\"&gt;Dagoth Ur&lt;/a&gt; resides inside a &lt;a href=\"Dagoth%20Ur%20%28Location%29\"&gt;facility&lt;/a&gt; deep inside the mountain, and the majority of the inhabitants in the region are servants of Dagoth Ur. Other than that, it is uninhabited, though you can find the occasional mine on the Mountain's slopes, for it is rich in natural resources such as ebony ore and raw glass. Plants are extremely scarce and most of the trees are dead. Only &lt;a href=\"trama\"&gt;trama&lt;/a&gt; shrubs, scathecraw and fire ferns have a chance of surviving here. Adventurers rarely venture past Ghostgate.\nPolitics.\nVvardenfell politics is a dance between the three &lt;a href=\"Great%20Houses\"&gt;Great Houses&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"House%20Hlaalu\"&gt;Hlaalu&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"House%20Telvanni\"&gt;Telvanni&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"House%20Redoran\"&gt;Redoran&lt;/a&gt;, as well as the &lt;a href=\"Tribunal%20Temple\"&gt;Tribunal Temple&lt;/a&gt;, both Imperial and &lt;a href=\"Dunmer\"&gt;Dunmer&lt;/a&gt;, and the &lt;a href=\"Empire\"&gt;Empire&lt;/a&gt; itself. The houses maintain an air of peace and fraternal loyalty, but constant incursions, especially by 'rogue Telvanni', keep tensions high. Adding to this political tension is the strong influence of the native Dunmer temple, which controls much of Vvardenfell, and the twin influences of the Empire and the &lt;a href=\"Imperial%20Cult\"&gt;Imperial Cult&lt;/a&gt;, which wish to maintain stability and control the island.\nMorrowind was the only province where &lt;a href=\"slavery\"&gt;slavery&lt;/a&gt; was still legal, until sometime between the events of and the events of , King &lt;a href=\"Hlaalu%20Helseth\"&gt;Hlaalu Helseth&lt;/a&gt; abolished slavery.\nThe Blight.\nThe Blight is a serious disease that infects people and animals. It is a major factor in the events of \"Morrowind\" as one of the primary antagonists of the game.\nThe Ashblight emanates from &lt;a href=\"Red%20Mountain\"&gt;Red Mountain&lt;/a&gt; in the form of Ashstorms. These storms are reddish dust storms that carry the blight and have extremely high winds associated with them. Due to the danger of infection and belligerent creatures, residents of Vvardenfell often advise against travelling during an Ashstorm.\nSymptoms.\nThe Ashblight has several separate symptoms, depending on who it is contracted by. &lt;a href=\"Characters%20%28Morrowind%29\"&gt;Characters&lt;/a&gt; who contract the disease are weakened by it: variants of the disease may reduce attributes such as strength and dexterity. The creatures of Morrowind are also affected by their infection. Creatures who have contracted the Ashblight often have higher &lt;a href=\"Health%20%28Morrowind%29\"&gt;Health&lt;/a&gt; and are stronger than their unaffected counterparts. The disease causes uncommon aggression in normally peaceful creatures, such as &lt;a href=\"Kwama\"&gt;Kwama&lt;/a&gt;.\nOrigin and elimination.\nThe Ashblight (along with &lt;a href=\"Corprus\"&gt;Corprus&lt;/a&gt;) was created by &lt;a href=\"Dagoth%20Ur%20%28Character%29\"&gt;Dagoth Ur&lt;/a&gt;, the main antagonist of the game. According to him, the Ashblight was used to help gain converts to the &lt;a href=\"House%20Dagoth\"&gt;Sixth House&lt;/a&gt; cult. As Dagoth Ur resided in the ruins of the Dwemer stronghold in Red Mountain, the Ashblight spread through the Red Mountain Ashstorms. During the events of the third Elder Scrolls game, however, the &lt;a href=\"Nerevarine\"&gt;Nerevarine&lt;/a&gt;, the reincarnation of an ancient warrior named Nerevar, killed Dagoth Ur and, therefore, cut the source of the Ashblight, effectively eliminating it. Afterwards, the ashstorms lose their red tint, and become simple ashstorms again; although the Blight is eliminated, a few \"Blighted\" creatures remain.\nFourth Era.\nBy &lt;a href=\"4E%205\"&gt;4E 5&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"Baar%20Dau\"&gt;Ministry of Truth&lt;/a&gt; fell and the Red Mountain erupted, almost completely destroying Vvardenfell. It caused much of the island to be covered in lava, deforming the land, and many settlements were subsequently destroyed. As a result, many residents fled to the mainland of Morrowind. By &lt;a href=\"4E%20201\"&gt;4E 201&lt;/a&gt;, Vvardenfell would continue to remain a volcanic wasteland, and transportation would no longer be available."}

The Vvardenfell District of Morrowind has had an extensive history surrounding the rise of the &lt;a href=\"Tribunal\"&gt;Tribunal&lt;/a&gt; and their endeavors ranging from the &lt;a href=\"War%20of%20the%20First%20Council\"&gt;War of the First Council&lt;/a&gt; to the &lt;a href=\"Tiber%20Wars\"&gt;Tiber Wars&lt;/a&gt;. The &lt;a href=\"Sea%20of%20Ghosts\"&gt;Sea of Ghosts&lt;/a&gt; lies off the north coast of Vvardenfell, and the island of &lt;a href=\"Solstheim\"&gt;Solstheim&lt;/a&gt; lies due to the northwest. All other coasts of Vvardenfell are more densely populated than its interior; together the coasts make up five of the nine named regions and are host to the majority of Vvardenfell's Imperial forts and towns, as well.\nRegions.\nAscadian Isles.\nThe Ascadian Isles is one of the nine regions of Vvardenfell. The region is a large collection of islands (ideally an archipelago) that make up the south-central coastline of the Vvardenfell District. The land is a fertile grassland that many settlements utilize to thrive in the area. The capital of both Vvardenfell and the Ascadian Isles is &lt;a href=\"Vivec%20City%20%28Morrowind%29\"&gt;Vivec City&lt;/a&gt; and the city of &lt;a href=\"Ebonheart%20%28Morrowind%29\"&gt;Ebonheart&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href=\"Vivec\"&gt;Vivec&lt;/a&gt; of the Tribunal resides in the &lt;a href=\"Palace%20of%20Vivec\"&gt;Palace of Vivec&lt;/a&gt;, the southernmost canton in the city. &lt;a href=\"Duke%20Vedam%20Dren%20%28Morrowind%29\"&gt;Duke Vedam Dren&lt;/a&gt; is the current leader of the &lt;a href=\"Imperial\"&gt;Imperial&lt;/a&gt; Government in Vvardenfell and lives in &lt;a href=\"Castle%20Ebonheart\"&gt;Castle Ebonheart&lt;/a&gt; on the western end of Ebonheart City. Smaller settlements such as &lt;a href=\"Suran%20%28Morrowind%29\"&gt;Suran&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Pelagiad\"&gt;Pelagiad&lt;/a&gt; exist across the lakeside of &lt;a href=\"Lake%20Amaya%20%28Morrowind%29\"&gt;Lake Amaya&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Lake%20Masobi\"&gt;Lake Masobi&lt;/a&gt;.\nAshlands.\nThe Vvardenfell Ashlands is one of the nine regions of Vvardenfell. The regional Ashlands take up a significant portion of the northern coast of Vvardenfell and the surrounding areas of Red Mountain. The area itself is mostly inhospitable as the ash storms that envelop the region make breathing seemingly impossible, regardless many Dunmer civilizations inhabit the area. The capital of the region is the city of &lt;a href=\"Ald%27ruhn%20%28Morrowind%29\"&gt;Ald'ruhn&lt;/a&gt;, the Capital of &lt;a href=\"House%20Redoran%20%28Morrowind%29\"&gt;House Redoran&lt;/a&gt; in Vvardenfell. Smaller settlements such as &lt;a href=\"Maar%20Gan\"&gt;Maar Gan&lt;/a&gt; exist along the northern rim in Red Mountain, near the coastline. The Councilor of House Redoran is Archmaster &lt;a href=\"Bolvyn%20Venim%20%28Morrowind%29\"&gt;Bolvyn Venim&lt;/a&gt;. The &lt;a href=\"Urshilaku%20Camp%20%28Morrowind%29\"&gt;Urshilaku Camp&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"Ashlanders%20%28Morrowind%29\"&gt;Ashlanders&lt;/a&gt; is located on the northern coast looking towards the Western Islands of Sheogorad.\nAzura's Coast.\nAzura's Coast is one of the nine regions of Vvardenfell. The region itself is named after the &lt;a href=\"Daedric%20Prince\"&gt;Daedric Prince&lt;/a&gt; of Dusk &amp; Dawn, the Daedric Prince &lt;a href=\"Azura\"&gt;Azura&lt;/a&gt;. The area is the entire Eastern Coast of Vvardenfell that faces the &lt;a href=\"Telvanni%20Peninsula\"&gt;Telvanni Peninsula&lt;/a&gt; in the east, and it is because of this, Azura's Coast is densely populated by different &lt;a href=\"House%20Telvanni\"&gt;House Telvanni&lt;/a&gt; settlements and Mushroom Towers. The region consists of a series of small islands that stretch along the coastline and isolated Daedric ruins with significant amounts of history. The capital of the region is the city of &lt;a href=\"Sadrith%20Mora%20%28Morrowind%29\"&gt;Sadrith Mora&lt;/a&gt;, the city is also the Capital of House Telvanni in Vvardenfell. Smaller settlements such as &lt;a href=\"Tel%20Branora%20%28Morrowind%29\"&gt;Tel Branora&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Tel%20Aruhn%20%28Morrowind%29\"&gt;Tel Aruhn&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Tel%20Mora%20%28Morrowind%29\"&gt;Tel Mora&lt;/a&gt; exist all across Azura's Coast. A smaller region exists in Azura's Coast called the &lt;a href=\"Zafirbel%20Bay\"&gt;Zafirbel Bay&lt;/a&gt;, which is where Tel Aruhn is located. Because the region is occupied by House Telvanni, slavery is prominent in the region and is seen primarily in Sadrith Mora.\nBitter Coast.\nThe Bitter Coast or the Smuggler's Coast is one of the nine regions of Vvardenfell. The area is mostly uninhabitable due to the humid weather and salted marshes. Regardless, a lot of criminal activity is practiced in the Bitter Coast because the region is under the Radar from the &lt;a href=\"Imperial%20Legion%20%28Morrowind%29\"&gt;Imperial Legion&lt;/a&gt;. The coastline has many sea caves that big groups such as the &lt;a href=\"Camonna%20Tong%20%28Morrowind%29\"&gt;Camonna Tong&lt;/a&gt; have authority in the region. The de facto capital of the region is the town of &lt;a href=\"Seyda%20Neen%20%28Morrowind%29\"&gt;Seyda Neen&lt;/a&gt; and is also the starting location of the game. Smaller settlements such as &lt;a href=\"Gnaar%20Mok\"&gt;Gnaar Mok&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Hla%20Oad\"&gt;Hla Oad&lt;/a&gt; exist further into the coast and have little contact with the Legion. In fact, the Camonna Tong oppress the people in these towns by heavily taxing them. The &lt;a href=\"Hlormaren%20%28Morrowind%29\"&gt;Hlormaren Stronghold&lt;/a&gt; is a popular stronghold used by many different people throughout the years.\nGrazelands.\nThe Grazelands is one of the nine regions. The regional grazelands consist of the northeastern portion of Vvardenfell and have multiple different &lt;a href=\"Ashlander\"&gt;Ashlander&lt;/a&gt; camps located in the area. The region is a breath of fresh air from the dangerous landscapes of Vvardenfell, and because of this, many people settle in the region ranging from the many Ashlander tribes to the House Telvanni nobles. The town of &lt;a href=\"Vos%20%28Morrowind%29\"&gt;Vos&lt;/a&gt; is one of the biggest settlements in the Grazelands despite being a mere fishing village. The only other settlements are Ashlander camps and Telvanni Towers. &lt;a href=\"Ahemmusa%20Camp%20%28Morrowind%29\"&gt;Ahemmusa Camp&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Zainab%20Camp%20%28Morrowind%29\"&gt;Zainab Camp&lt;/a&gt; are located here and are one of the four top Ashlander camps in Vvardenfell. The towns of &lt;a href=\"Tel%20Mora%20%28Morrowind%29\"&gt;Tel Mora&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Tel%20Vos%20%28Morrowind%29\"&gt;Tel Vos&lt;/a&gt; surround Vos from the west and east respectively. The two prevalent strongholds in the region are &lt;a href=\"Falensarano%20%28Morrowind%29\"&gt;Falensarano&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Indoranyon%20%28Morrowind%29\"&gt;Indoranyan&lt;/a&gt;.\nMolag Amur.\nMolag Amur is one of the nine regions of Vvardenfell. The region is considered the southern portion of the Ashlands since the terrain is very similar. Molag Amur stretches as far as Eastern Balmora, all the way to Azura's Coast. Not many settlements are prone to exist in Molag Amur other than the occasional Ashlander camp such as the &lt;a href=\"Erabenimsun%20Camp%20%28Morrowind%29\"&gt;Erabenimsun Camp&lt;/a&gt;. The only important town to exist in the region is &lt;a href=\"Molag%20Mar%20%28Morrowind%29\"&gt;Molag Mar&lt;/a&gt;, a town that was built as an open air canton similar to the cantons in Vivec City. There is a Telvanni tower located north of Molag Mar called &lt;a href=\"Tel%20Uvirith\"&gt;Tel Uvirith&lt;/a&gt;, home to &lt;a href=\"Reynel%20Uvirith\"&gt;Reynel Uvirith&lt;/a&gt;. The area has a wide variety of &lt;a href=\"Foyada\"&gt;Foyada&lt;/a&gt;s and ancient &lt;a href=\"Dwemer%20ruins\"&gt;Dwemer ruins&lt;/a&gt; including &lt;a href=\"Nchuleftingth%20%28Morrowind%29\"&gt;Nchuleftingth&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Foyada%20Ilibaal\"&gt;Foyada Ilibaal&lt;/a&gt;. The ruins of &lt;a href=\"Galom%20Daeus%20%28Morrowind%29\"&gt;Galom Daeus&lt;/a&gt; are occupied by the &lt;a href=\"Berne%20Clan\"&gt;Berne Clan&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"Vampire%20%28Morrowind%29\"&gt;Vampires&lt;/a&gt;. The area is also prone to have &lt;a href=\"Daedra\"&gt;Daedra&lt;/a&gt; roaming the ashlands.\nRed Mountain.\nRed Mountain is one of the nine regions of Vvardenfell. The region consists of the area around the entrance of the &lt;a href=\"Red%20Mountain\"&gt;Red Mountain&lt;/a&gt; volcano and the &lt;a href=\"Ghostfence\"&gt;Ghostfence&lt;/a&gt;. This area is riddled with the &lt;a href=\"Blight\"&gt;Blight&lt;/a&gt; since the region is regularly covered in Ashstorms. There are no settlements on the mountain, other than several &lt;a href=\"House%20Dagoth\"&gt;Sixth House&lt;/a&gt; bases in the area and the &lt;a href=\"Ghostgate\"&gt;Ghostgate&lt;/a&gt; on the southern wall of Ghostfence. The few notable exterior locations include the ruins of &lt;a href=\"Kogoruhn\"&gt;Kogoruhn&lt;/a&gt; in the north, the ruins of &lt;a href=\"Odrosal\"&gt;Odrosal&lt;/a&gt;, and the holy grounds of the &lt;a href=\"Shrine%20of%20Pride\"&gt;Shrine of Pride&lt;/a&gt;. The inside of Red Mountain has several underground strongholds inside, one of these fortresses is &lt;a href=\"Dagoth%20Ur%20%28Morrowind%20Location%29\"&gt;Dagoth Ur&lt;/a&gt;, the home of &lt;a href=\"Dagoth%20Ur%20%28Character%29\"&gt;Dagoth Ur&lt;/a&gt; and the Sixth Houses. The &lt;a href=\"Heart%20of%20Lorkhan\"&gt;Heart of Lorkhan&lt;/a&gt; is located here as well as the unfinished remains of &lt;a href=\"Akulakhan\"&gt;Akulakhan&lt;/a&gt;. Red Mountain has never erupted before and has remained dormant into the &lt;a href=\"Third%20Era\"&gt;Third Era&lt;/a&gt;.\nSheogorad.\nThe Island of Sheogorad is one of the nine regions of Vvardenfell. The area takes its name from the &lt;a href=\"Daedric%20Prince\"&gt;Daedric Prince&lt;/a&gt; of Madness, &lt;a href=\"Sheogorath\"&gt;Sheogorath&lt;/a&gt;, a member of the &lt;a href=\"House%20of%20Troubles\"&gt;House of Troubles&lt;/a&gt;. The region consists of several islands, including the main island of Sheogorad, with its ruins of &lt;a href=\"Mzuleft\"&gt;Mzuleft&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Rotheran\"&gt;Rotheran&lt;/a&gt;. A desolate region, all the other islands are unnamed and are unpopulated, despite &lt;a href=\"Ancestral%20Tombs%20%28Morrowind%29\"&gt;Dunmer ancestral tombs&lt;/a&gt; scattered among them. The only settlement in the area is the fishing village of &lt;a href=\"Dagon%20Fel\"&gt;Dagon Fel&lt;/a&gt;, a village of &lt;a href=\"Nords%20%28Morrowind%29\"&gt;Nordic&lt;/a&gt; origins as well as &lt;a href=\"Dwarven\"&gt;Dwarven&lt;/a&gt; memorabilia. Dagon Fel is under the occupation of the &lt;a href=\"Imperial%20Legion%20%28Morrowind%29\"&gt;Imperial Legion&lt;/a&gt;. The Velothi tower of &lt;a href=\"Ald%20Redaynia\"&gt;Ald Redaynia&lt;/a&gt; is located on the westernmost point of the region, on a cape overlooking the &lt;a href=\"Sea%20of%20Ghosts\"&gt;Sea of Ghosts&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href=\"Vas\"&gt;Vas&lt;/a&gt; is a Velothi tower to the west-northwest of Sheogorad, and &lt;a href=\"Sanni\"&gt;Sanni&lt;/a&gt; a Velothi tower to the east-southeast. The &lt;a href=\"Aundae%20Clan\"&gt;Aundae Clan&lt;/a&gt; are one of the three most powerful &lt;a href=\"Vampire%20%28Morrowind%29\"&gt;Vampires&lt;/a&gt; clans in Vvardenfell; they live in &lt;a href=\"Ashmelech\"&gt;Ashmelech&lt;/a&gt;, a cave on the southern island near the &lt;a href=\"Ashlands\"&gt;Ashlands&lt;/a&gt;.\nWest Gash.\nThe West Gash is one of the nine regions of Vvardenfell. The area was created in a battle between Vivec of the Tribunal and the &lt;a href=\"Ruddy%20Man\"&gt;Ruddy Man&lt;/a&gt;. West Gash is an extensive grazeland with rocky formations along the coast and areas around the Ashlands. The area is primarily occupied by both &lt;a href=\"House%20Hlaalu%20%28Morrowind%29\"&gt;House Hlaalu&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"House%20Redoran%20%28Morrowind%29\"&gt;House Redoran&lt;/a&gt;, both of whom have substantial holdings in West Gash. The Hlaalu Capital of Vvardenfell is the city of &lt;a href=\"Balmora%20%28Morrowind%29\"&gt;Balmora&lt;/a&gt;, located on the northern end of the &lt;a href=\"Odai%20River\"&gt;Odai River&lt;/a&gt;. The mining town of &lt;a href=\"Gnisis%20%28Morrowind%29\"&gt;Gnisis&lt;/a&gt; is located on the northwestern peninsula, along the &lt;a href=\"Samsi%20River\"&gt;Samsi River&lt;/a&gt; edge. The town of &lt;a href=\"Caldera%20%28Morrowind%29\"&gt;Caldera&lt;/a&gt; is an &lt;a href=\"Imperials%20%28Morrowind%29\"&gt;Imperial&lt;/a&gt; mining town that produces large amounts of Ebony for the Empire. The ruins of &lt;a href=\"Arkngthunch-Sturdumz%20%28Morrowind%29\"&gt;Arkngthunch-Sturdumz&lt;/a&gt; and the stronghold of &lt;a href=\"Berandas\"&gt;Berandas&lt;/a&gt; are monuments to a time long forgotten by the people of Vvardenfell."}

The zone does not extend to the &lt;a href=\"Sheogorad\"&gt;Sheogorad&lt;/a&gt; region in the north.\nBackground.\nWhile much of Vvardenfell has been populated by the Great Houses and their cities, including &lt;a href=\"Balmora%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Balmora&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Sadrith%20Mora%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Sadrith Mora&lt;/a&gt;, the city of &lt;a href=\"Vivec%20City%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Vivec&lt;/a&gt; is still under construction. While much of the city's vital infrastructure has been completed, several cantons are still being constructed, bringing industry and workers to the islands southern coast.\n&lt;a href=\"House%20Redoran%20%28Online%29\"&gt;House Redoran&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"House%20Telvanni%20%28Online%29\"&gt;House Telvanni&lt;/a&gt; are the dominant competing political forces on the island, with Redoran controlling much of the western holdings and Telvanni in the east. Because they are not members of the &lt;a href=\"Ebonheart%20Pact\"&gt;Ebonheart Pact&lt;/a&gt;, House Telvanni continues using and trading &lt;a href=\"slaves\"&gt;slaves&lt;/a&gt;, including &lt;a href=\"Argonians%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Argonians&lt;/a&gt;, which has led to increasing tensions between the Houses.\nLocations.\nThe following are locations accessible in Vvardenfell and, with the exception of &lt;a href=\"Unmarked%20Locations%20%28Online%29\"&gt;unmarked locations&lt;/a&gt;, are discoverable on the map. Points of Interest serve as locations with unique side quests, while &lt;a href=\"Cities%20%28Online%29\"&gt;cities&lt;/a&gt; serve as the centralised areas with multiple sublocations and act as a hub for services and &lt;a href=\"Merchants%20%28Online%29\"&gt;merchants&lt;/a&gt;. Explanations of the types of locations are provided in the &lt;a href=\"Locations%20%28Online%29%23Types\"&gt;main locations page&lt;/a&gt;.\nQuests.\nVvardenfell features a series of zone story quests and unrelated side quests. The zone story quests tie into the &lt;a href=\"Daedric%20War\"&gt;Daedric War&lt;/a&gt; overarching storyline and continues on to the &lt;a href=\"Clockwork%20City%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Clockwork City&lt;/a&gt;, but it is not necessary to complete the zone quests for other zones prior to those in the Clockwork City. Side quests are non-sequential and can be completed in any order, except where one carries on from another, and &lt;a href=\"repeatable%20quests\"&gt;repeatable quests&lt;/a&gt; can be completed multiple times: weekly for arenas and trials and daily for all others.\nItem Sets.\nItem sets are related armor and weapons that, when worn together, provide unique benefits. Overland sets can be acquired from world bosses, world events, delves, public dungeons and containers and as quest rewards; dungeon sets can be acquired from within group dungeons; monster sets can be acquired from the final boss of veteran group dungeons and Undaunted Enclaves; and crafted sets can be created at specific locations across the zone.\nSkyshards.\nEighteen Skyshards can be found in Auridon totaling in six &lt;a href=\"skill%20points\"&gt;skill points&lt;/a&gt;. The zone guide provides clues as to the location of each Skyshard, but many can be found simply by exploring and watching for the distinctive pillar of light they emit. Skyshards will appear on the map and compass when the Vestige is close to one and will remain discovered on the map even if it was not collected.\nAchievements.\nAchievements can be earned by completing specific tasks such as completing quests and discovering locations. Achievements are separated into categories and their progress is viewable from the journal. Earning achievement provides the Vestige a number of points, and some achievements unlock unique rewards such as &lt;a href=\"Furnishings%20%28Online%29\"&gt;furnishings&lt;/a&gt; that can be bought from Achievement Furnishers or &lt;a href=\"collectibles\"&gt;collectibles&lt;/a&gt;.\nShalidor's Library.\nTen books that are a part of Shalidor's Library can be found in Vvardenfell and added to the collection. Books that have already been found in other zones will already be marked as completed in the zone tracker.\nFish.\nFish can be caught from fishing hotspots, ideally with the correct &lt;a href=\"bait\"&gt;bait&lt;/a&gt;. Common fish will be caught most often while rare fish and alternative bait are rare catches.

Zenimax stated \"That's not to say adventurers in The Elder Scrolls Online won't ever be able to visit Vvardenfell.\" The pre-alpha map of Tamriel displayed Vvardenfell as a future zone. During the September 10, 2014 Writer's AmA, &lt;a href=\"Lawrence%20Schick\"&gt;Lawrence Schick&lt;/a&gt; said that &lt;a href=\"Vivec\"&gt;Vivec&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Sotha%20Sil\"&gt;Sotha Sil&lt;/a&gt; are \"very busy and have their hands full,\" and that it will eventually be revealed what it is they are busy with, as Zenimax has big plans. As Vivec resides on Vvardenfell, this can be alluded to the future incorporation of the island.\nAfter &lt;a href=\"Public%20Test%20Server\"&gt;Public Test Server&lt;/a&gt; patch 2.4.0 added the DLC, 14 locations found on Vvardenfell in were added to the data files, located in many areas around the island's coast. After patch 2.5.0 containing the DLC was released, 60 new locations from Vvardenfell were found to be added to the data files, confirming each zone besides &lt;a href=\"Red%20Mountain\"&gt;Red Mountain&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Sheogorad\"&gt;Sheogorad&lt;/a&gt;, and the &lt;a href=\"Ashlands%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Ashlands&lt;/a&gt;. In the PTS 2.7.0 Homestead patch, a large overhead map of Vvardenfell was found, which showed most of the pre-existing locations already added to the files, as well as a few new ones. Only Sheogorad and part of the northern Ashlands were not completed zones."}

This also includes ancient &lt;a href=\"Daedric%20Shrines%20%28Morrowind%29\"&gt;Daedric ruins&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Dwemer%20Ruins\"&gt;Dwemer citadels&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Ashlanders%20%28Morrowind%29\"&gt;nomad&lt;/a&gt; camps, &lt;a href=\"House%20Redoran\"&gt;Redoran&lt;/a&gt; towns, Imperial towns, the strikingly unique &lt;a href=\"Fungi\"&gt;mushroom&lt;/a&gt; towers of the &lt;a href=\"House%20Telvanni%20%28Morrowind%29\"&gt;Telvanni&lt;/a&gt; wizards and the capital of Vvardenfell, &lt;a href=\"Vivec%20City%20%28Morrowind%29\"&gt;Vivec City&lt;/a&gt;.\nDunmer settlements.\nVivec City.\nVivec City presents a unique panorama of high Dunmer architectural style. Grand multi-tiered cantons are arranged along canals. The cantons have monumental pyramid-like architecture, many bridges connects them. Large buttresses run from the waterline to the roofs. High bridges also lead across the canals, connecting temples and plazas found at the top of the cantons. The whole city, a Dunmer-made island, advances in the &lt;a href=\"Inner%20Sea\"&gt;Inner Sea&lt;/a&gt;, where &lt;a href=\"Vivec\"&gt;Vivec&lt;/a&gt;'s &lt;a href=\"Palace%20of%20Vivec%20%28Morrowind%29\"&gt;Palace&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Archcanon\"&gt;Archcanon&lt;/a&gt;'s &lt;a href=\"High%20Fane\"&gt;High Fane&lt;/a&gt; can be seen.\nGreat Houses.\nThe three Dunmer &lt;a href=\"Great%20Houses\"&gt;great houses&lt;/a&gt; that have settled Vvardenfell have distinctive architectures and lifestyles.\nHouse Redoran.\nThe aristocratic &lt;a href=\"House%20Redoran\"&gt;Great House Redoran&lt;/a&gt; favors a spacious, organic building style, often resembling the shells of very large insects as seen in &lt;a href=\"Ald%27ruhn%20%28Morrowind%29\"&gt;Ald'ruhn&lt;/a&gt;, they are located generally in the central and north-western regions of Vvardenfell.\nHouse Hlaalu.\nGreat &lt;a href=\"House%20Hlaalu\"&gt;House Hlaalu&lt;/a&gt;, a mercantile power, influenced by Imperial culture, prefers plain, modern habitats, usually located in the south-western regions, as can be seen in &lt;a href=\"Balmora%20%28Morrowind%29\"&gt;Balmora&lt;/a&gt;.\nHouse Telvanni.\nThe &lt;a href=\"House%20Telvanni%20%28Morrowind%29\"&gt;Telvanni&lt;/a&gt; sorcerer lords live in their wizard towers that dominate mushroom hut villages. These are usually found on the eastern side of Vvardenfell, on the &lt;a href=\"Azura%27s%20Coast\"&gt;Azura's Coast&lt;/a&gt;, as can be seen in &lt;a href=\"Sadrith%20Mora%20%28Morrowind%29\"&gt;Sadrith Mora&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"Tel%20Fyr%20%28Morrowind%29\"&gt;Tel Fyr&lt;/a&gt;.\nTemples and manors.\nThe main religion in vvardenfell is the &lt;a href=\"Tribunal%20Temple\"&gt;Tribunal Temple&lt;/a&gt;, which has its headquarters in mainland Morrowind and in Vivec city, is represented in most towns by a temple. These temple compounds feature high walled outer courtyards and halls clustered around the Temple shrine as can be seen in &lt;a href=\"Vos%20%28Morrowind%29\"&gt;Vos&lt;/a&gt;. Compounds and residences in the plantations of the Great Houses are similar to the temple compounds with walled outer courts and buildings for craftsmen and servants, dominated by a grand manor residence as can be seen in the &lt;a href=\"Dren%20Plantation%20%28Morrowind%29\"&gt;Dren Plantation&lt;/a&gt;. In the plantations, the manor houses serves as central feature.\nDunmer towns.\nThe Dunmer villages are common in Vvardenfell's &lt;a href=\"Regions%20%28Morrowind%29\"&gt;regions&lt;/a&gt;. As can be seen in &lt;a href=\"Gnisis%20%28Morrowind%29\"&gt;Gnisis&lt;/a&gt;, huts are built of local materials, that must resist the harsh weather conditions of the island. Having organic curves inspired by the shells of giant native insects, like the &lt;a href=\"Silt%20Strider\"&gt;Silt Strider&lt;/a&gt; or in the case of the Redoran headquarters, &lt;a href=\"Ald%27ruhn-under-Skar\"&gt;Ald'ruhn-under-Skar&lt;/a&gt;, which is built inside an ancient giant crab shell. Villages are usually dominated by temple compounds and courtyards.\nImperial towns and castles.\nTowns.\n&lt;a href=\"Imperial\"&gt;Imperial&lt;/a&gt; style of buildings in their settlements is usually simple, sturdy buildings made of stone bricks, with Thatch roofs. Houses, shops, and tradehouses are of timbered, half timbered construction in the Western manner, with right angles and flat planes, and plain, undecorated exteriors, as can be seen in &lt;a href=\"Caldera\"&gt;Caldera&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"Pelagiad\"&gt;Pelagiad&lt;/a&gt;.\nFortified Castles.\nThe imperial castles, guard towers and fortifications are often on higher grounds and are made of large plain stonewalls, with tall towers as can be seen in &lt;a href=\"Ebonheart%20%28Morrowind%29\"&gt;Ebonheart&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"Tel%20Vos%20%28Morrowind%29\"&gt;Tel Vos&lt;/a&gt;.\nDwemer Ruins.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Dwemer\"&gt;Dwemer&lt;/a&gt;'s abandoned &lt;a href=\"Dwemer%20Ruins\"&gt;citadels&lt;/a&gt; dot the landscape of Vvardenfell. Only certain sections of the building are apparent above ground. Often bridges and many walls lie in ruin scattered around the rest of the building. Pipes run in every directions along the walls, that are decorated with lines of carved &lt;a href=\"Daedric%20Alphabet\"&gt;Daedric letters&lt;/a&gt;. Giant cogs, mechanical apparatus and mechanisms are an integral part of these citadel's architecture. The walls are made of a bronze-like metal and large carved stones. Most doors are round and small, they are often composed of long winding corridors, halls and domed rooms as can be seen in &lt;a href=\"Nchardahrk\"&gt;Nchardahrk&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"Mzuleft\"&gt;Mzuleft&lt;/a&gt;.\nDaedric shrines.\n&lt;a href=\"Daedric%20Shrines%20%28Morrowind%29\"&gt;Daedric shrines&lt;/a&gt; are strangely named and shaped buildings that can be found across the Dunmer Island, few dare venture close to them. The outside sections are often lying in ruins. The shrines are made of blocks of dark grey and black rocks. Completely covered in unusual decorative carvings. They usually have one tilted oval door that leads into dark corridors, and large halls. In the center of these ruins, often lies a large statue of one of the &lt;a href=\"Daedric%20Princes\"&gt;Daedric princes&lt;/a&gt;. All walls are, also, black and covered in strange carvings, with irregular jagged shapes protruding dangerously in any directions as can be seen in &lt;a href=\"Assurnabitashpi\"&gt;Assurnabitashpi&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"Onnissiralis\"&gt;Onnissiralis&lt;/a&gt;. Some are offshore, sunken or half-sunken at the bottom of the sea.\nAshlanders.\nthe &lt;a href=\"Ashlanders%20%28Morrowind%29\"&gt;Ashlanders&lt;/a&gt;, the ancient tribal Dunmer people, who still live as nomads, in their yurts. Theses simple round large tents, that are made of darkened beast skins and fabric, usually, house each ashlander in their own yurt, some of the larger ones are shared. The inside is decorated with hanging carpets and decorative &lt;a href=\"Her%20Hand%27s%20Shield\"&gt;shields&lt;/a&gt;, there are colorful lamps illuminating the room. A fire usually lies in the center of the yurt, surrounded by bedrolls as can be seen in the &lt;a href=\"Erabenimsun%20Camp\"&gt;Erabenimsun Camp&lt;/a&gt; or the &lt;a href=\"Urshilaku%20Camp%20%28Morrowind%29\"&gt;Urshilaku Camp&lt;/a&gt;."}

But the island expands as lava hardens, and new plants and fungi emerge from the cooling ashes amongst the formations of igneous rock.\nPlant life flourishes in the rich soil fertilized by volcanic activity, and so Vvardenfell is home to a diverse set of biomes.\nFungi quickly absorb rich nutrients from the volcanic soil and grow to enormous proportions to dominate the landscape. The large &lt;a href=\"Ink-Cap%20Mushroom\"&gt;Ink-Cap Mushroom&lt;/a&gt;s along the &lt;a href=\"Bitter%20Coast%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Bitter Coast&lt;/a&gt; thrive on the detritus of decaying swamp life, while smaller fungus varieties cover the rocks, trees and even some animals, such as the fungus-encrusted &lt;a href=\"Shroom%20Beetle\"&gt;Shroom Beetle&lt;/a&gt;. Adorable!\n&lt;a href=\"Balmora%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Balmora&lt;/a&gt;, in the southwest and inland from the Bitter Coast, is still forested, though ash from Red Mountain eruptions threatens to denude the slopes.\nThough barren, The Ashlands host a remarkable number of species. &lt;a href=\"Ash%20Hopper%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Ash Hoppers&lt;/a&gt; skitter through the dry ash dunes and giant &lt;a href=\"Xylaria\"&gt;Xylaria&lt;/a&gt; fungi extend their tendrils into the sky.

Hungry, reptilian &lt;a href=\"Cliff%20Strider%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Cliff Striders&lt;/a&gt; lurk atop the crags.\n&lt;a href=\"Fetcherflies\"&gt;Fetcherflies&lt;/a&gt; build their hives where they can tap volcanic heat to gestate their eggs. When they hatch, the queen taps a source of magma to animate the nest, and it transforms into a walking &lt;a href=\"Hive%20Golem\"&gt;Hive Golem&lt;/a&gt; that relocates the swarm to new surroundings.\n &lt;a href=\"Nix-Ox%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Nix-Oxen&lt;/a&gt; roam the &lt;a href=\"Grazelands%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Grazelands&lt;/a&gt; in the northeastern part of the island, and though generally considered to be mild-mannered, they will not hesitate to defend their territory.\nTwo-legged &lt;a href=\"Vvardvark\"&gt;Vvardvark&lt;/a&gt;s romp through the grasses and feed on small bugs.

The curse turned Vykosa into a hare who was constantly hunted for \"an endless hunt.\" Sometime later, Vykosa ceased being the hare and began forming her own pack in retaliation for those who harmed and hated her kind. Vykosa planned to overtake &lt;a href=\"Tamriel\"&gt;Tamriel&lt;/a&gt;, with a goal to exact vengeance against Hircine as well.\nAccording to &lt;a href=\"Letter%20to%20Balorgh\"&gt;a letter&lt;/a&gt; she wrote to &lt;a href=\"Balorgh\"&gt;Balorgh&lt;/a&gt;, Vykosa intended to infiltrate the &lt;a href=\"Hircine%27s%20Hunting%20Grounds\"&gt;Hunting Grounds&lt;/a&gt; and relied on Balorgh to find the means of doing so. Although Balorgh managed to infiltrate the realm, he refused to seek out Hircine's weakness, and chose to remain to fulfill his own personal agenda. \nVykosa herself resided in &lt;a href=\"Moon%20Hunter%20Keep\"&gt;Moon Hunter Keep&lt;/a&gt;, a base of operations formerly belonging to werewolf hunters known as the &lt;a href=\"Order%20of%20the%20Silver%20Dawn\"&gt;Order of the Silver Dawn&lt;/a&gt;. Vykosa has since taken over the keep and intends to draw her fellow lycanthropes to her cause of taking over Tamriel.

Also, he kept calling himself &lt;a href=\"Sheogorath\"&gt;Sheogorath&lt;/a&gt;, not Hermaeus Mora. Still, I was so happy to have successfully summoned Hermaeus Mora, these inconsistencies did not bother me. He had me do some things that didn't make any sense to me (beyond the mortal scope, breadth, and ken, I suppose), and then his servant happily gave me something he called the &lt;a href=\"Wabbajack\"&gt;Wabbajack&lt;/a&gt;.

We weren't sure what was going on, truth be told. But we all knew it wasn't good.\nThat's when we started to hear the screaming from within the mist. Everyone started to rush out of the city's gates, fast as they could. I've never seen a more panicked crowd in my life. Everyone screaming, running, trying to escape.\nBut the mist was faster than our steps, and soon we were enveloped by it. It felt like a cold fog against my skin. Suddenly, my knees buckled. All my strength left me at once. I could feel my heartbeats beginning to slow. My whole being felt heavy. Never before had I felt such extreme exhaustion.\nI knew I was going to die. Soon, my heartbeat would entirely stop. As I laid there, all I could think was... how many will die with me?\nIt was then that I was grasped within two mighty talons. Welkynar\u00a0&lt;a href=\"Olorime\"&gt;Olorime&lt;/a&gt;\u00a0had come to save me, quickly placing me in the upper reaches of the city. I barely remember my rescue, albeit the feeling of my torso being tightly squeezed, the wind against my skin.\nI don't know what manner of power that Sea Sload has, nor do I want to. But it nearly took my life. Just as it has already taken the lives of so many others."}

They seem to be relying on a priest of Mara named Erandur for assistance.\"\nWalkthrough.\nThe people of Dawnstar are not sleeping well, experiencing terrible nightmares every night. Erandur, a priest of Mara, wants the Dragonborn's help to destroy the Skull of Corruption, which will release &lt;a href=\"Vaermina\"&gt;Vaermina&lt;/a&gt;'s hold on people's dreams.\nThis quest is given after visiting Dawnstar and speaking to Erandur, who is in the &lt;a href=\"Windpeak%20Inn\"&gt;Windpeak Inn&lt;/a&gt;, and is initially seen speaking to some of the miners who work in Dawnstar, easing their fear and concern over the nightmares they've been having. All the townsfolk are suffering the same nightmares and Erandur knows how to get rid of them. He wants the Dragonborn to travel with him to the Nightcaller Temple, which is just a short distance east of Dawnstar, to stop the nightmares. If pressed for details, he simply insists that the Dragonborn needs to trust him as a priest of Mara.\nThe entrance to Nightcaller Temple is the home of three &lt;a href=\"Frost%20Troll%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;frost trolls&lt;/a&gt;. Snow bears, snowy sabre cats, ice wraiths or frostbite spiders may be there instead, depending on the Dragonborn's level. At the entrance, Erandur warns about the dangers within. Priests and &lt;a href=\"Orsimer%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Orcs&lt;/a&gt; battled, until a gas called the Miasma was released that put everyone (both priests and Orcs) to sleep. He fears that, when the doors are opened, the gas will dissipate, and everyone will wake up and be hostile.\nOnce inside, the quest mainly requires the Dragonborn to follow Erandur. Erandur will cast a fire spell on the wall to create an opening. In the next room, Erandur points out the Skull of Corruption, and says that the inner sanctum must be entered. Following him down a curving set of steps leads to some leveled Orcs waking up that will attack if given the chance, and a blue barrier. When the barrier is reached, Erandur reveals himself as a former priest of Vaermina who ran away during a long-ago attack on the temple by the orcs. He became a priest of Mara and now wishes to resolve loose ends in the Temple.\nIn order to pass through the barrier it will be necessary to go to the library to find the book \"The Dreamstride\". There will be &lt;a href=\"Vaermina%20Devotee\"&gt;Vaermina Devotee&lt;/a&gt;s to fight along the way and inside the library. Upon locating the book, Erandur states that there is a way to pass the barrier, but it requires &lt;a href=\"Vaermina%27s%20Torpor\"&gt;Vaermina's Torpor&lt;/a&gt;, a potion that allows the user to travel by following another's dreams.\nThe next stop will be the laboratory, where Vaermina's Torpor is stored. There are some more invader Orcs and Vaermina Devotees that will need to be dealt with along the way. The Torpor is located on the shelf in the corner of the laboratory. When Vaermina's Torpor is located, Erandur instructs the Dragonborn to drink it and upon doing so, they will become &lt;a href=\"Casimir\"&gt;Casimir&lt;/a&gt;, a Vaermina Devotee during the Orc raid on the temple. Casimir is instructed to release the Miasma to protect the Skull.\nAfter releasing the Miasma by pulling a large ring on a chain on the wall just to the left of the barrier, the Dragonborn will find themselves on the other side of the barrier, where they must collect the Soul Gem powering it. Erandur remarks about what happened, and then proceeds to the inner sanctum.\nAs the inner sanctum is approached, &lt;a href=\"Veren\"&gt;Veren&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Thorek%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Thorek&lt;/a&gt; appear. They are the two Vaermina Devotees that told Casimir\u2014the Dragonborn in the dream\u2014to release the Miasma. After some short dialogue that reveals Erandur to be Casimir, they become hostile. After the battle, Erandur casts a spell to destroy the Skull of Corruption.\nHere the choice is to kill &lt;a href=\"Erandur\"&gt;Erandur&lt;/a&gt; as Vaermina commands and take the Skull of Corruption or let him complete his spell to destroy the Skull.\n\"He's deceiving you. When the ritual's complete, the Skull will be free and then Erandur will turn on you. Quickly! Kill him now. Kill him and claim the Skull for your own! Vaermina commands you!\"\nIf he lives, he can be a &lt;a href=\"Followers%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;follower&lt;/a&gt; for no charge. However, this gives up the chance to acquire one of the\u00a0&lt;a href=\"Daedric%20Artifacts%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Daedric artifacts&lt;/a&gt;, which are needed to obtain the &lt;a href=\"Oblivion%20Walker\"&gt;Oblivion Walker&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Achievements%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;achievement&lt;/a&gt;.\u00a0Whichever choice one makes, the nightmares plaguing the citizens of Dawnstar will stop. This will also free up the opportunity to speak to &lt;a href=\"Skald%20the%20Elder\"&gt;Skald the Elder&lt;/a&gt; to become Thane of the Pale and acquire &lt;a href=\"Heljarchen%20Hall\"&gt;Heljarchen Hall&lt;/a&gt; if is installed.\nNightmare Reactions.\nBefore the quest is completed, the following Dawnstar residents will complain about the nightmares:"}

The Walkabout was discovered by &lt;a href=\"Ruptga\"&gt;Ruptga&lt;/a&gt;, chief deity of the Yokudan pantheon, as means for the spirits to survive the Hunger of Satakal. Ruptga taught the other spirits how to endure the cycle, and the practice became so easy that it became a place called the &lt;a href=\"Far%20Shores\"&gt;Far Shores&lt;/a&gt;. Ruptga placed the stars in the sky in order to help weaker spirits achieve Walkabout, and after many cycles there were too many spirits for Ruptga to help out. For this reason, Ruptga made a helper named &lt;a href=\"Sep\"&gt;Sep&lt;/a&gt; from the skins of past worlds. Sep, however, was driven crazy by multiple hungers from multiple skins, and instead of helping Ruptga regulate the spirit trade he gathered the rest of the old skins, and made them into a world. He convinced some of the spirits this is an easier alternative to the Walkabout, but the spirits who followed him became trapped there as mortals."}

In our latest volume, we cover &lt;a href=\"Solitude%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Solitude&lt;/a&gt;. Spatior could not be more pleased to be at the very seat of &lt;a href=\"Imperial\"&gt;Imperial&lt;/a&gt; power in &lt;a href=\"Skyrim\"&gt;Skyrim&lt;/a&gt;. In the course of our tour, you'll see that Solitude's riches extend from her people to the history and the architecture that make up the city itself.\nAs ever, we begin our journey outside the city walls, this time at the bottom of the hill that ascends all the way to Solitude's massive gates.\nSolitude's Surroundings\nBefore scaling to the city, you should be sure to take in the sights. Wander the track that leads down to the docks, and you can stop to enjoy one of the best views of the Great Arch.\nOriginally serving as both a landmark and windbreak for Solitude's port, the easily-defended Great Arch also provided an ideal building site for the ancient &lt;a href=\"Nords%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Nords&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe city gradually grew to extend across the entire length of the arch. This growth culminated in the building of the &lt;a href=\"Blue%20Palace%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Blue Palace&lt;/a&gt;, home to the &lt;a href=\"High%20King\"&gt;High King&lt;/a&gt;s and Queens of Skyrim. We will visit the palace later.\nThe Gates of Solitude\nEntrance to Solitude is guarded by two gates and three towers. The first of these towers, situated at the crossroads, is &lt;a href=\"Sky%20Tower\"&gt;Sky Tower&lt;/a&gt;. It's mostly a lookout, although in times of war, barricades are erected across the nearby road to act as a first line of defense.\nThe second tower and first, smaller gate are collectively known as the &lt;a href=\"Squall%20Gate\"&gt;Squall Gate&lt;/a&gt;. Here, attacking armies meet their first real resistance. Last and certainly most impressive is the &lt;a href=\"Storm%20Gate\"&gt;Storm Gate&lt;/a&gt;.\nWhile &lt;a href=\"Castle%20Dour%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Castle Dour&lt;/a&gt;, found just within the city's main gate, has always been a massive walled structure, Solitude's outer walls and gates were not added until shortly after the coronation of High King &lt;a href=\"Erling\"&gt;Erling&lt;/a&gt;.\nLooking up and to the left of the main gate, you can see a small hint of Erling's preference for a more rounded style of architecture that we will see later in the Castle Dour extension, as well as the interior arch and the windmill.\nNow we pass through the gates and enter the main shopping district of Solitude.\nThe Well District\nStepping inside Solitude's gates, you get your first view of the city itself. Rising tall and proud before you, banners waiving from its crown, is the Emperor's Tower. Home to the Kings of &lt;a href=\"Haafingar\"&gt;Haafingar&lt;/a&gt; before the consolidation of Skyrim and the creation of the Blue Palace, the Emperor's Tower is now used exclusively as guest quarters for &lt;a href=\"Emperor\"&gt;Emperor&lt;/a&gt;s who come to visit the city.\nTo your left and right are Solitude's &lt;a href=\"The%20Winking%20Skeever\"&gt;inn&lt;/a&gt; and shops. Here can be found some of the finest imported goods in Skyrim. After all, Solitude is a wealthy city with ready access to the major shipping lanes of &lt;a href=\"Tamriel\"&gt;Tamriel&lt;/a&gt;.\nContinuing ahead, you'll come to the ramp that takes you up to Castle Dour. From here, you can truly feel the weight of this stone bastion's looming presence. To the left-most tower, topped by the pointed roof of Erling's extension, was once the castle barracks and jail. Today, the tower is the center of military power here in Solitude.\nLooking right past the looming Emperor's Tower, you can glimpse Solitude's natural bridge arcing gracefully over to the windmill. Built during High King Erling's day, the bridge was said to be used to discretely allow &lt;a href=\"Captain%20Jytte\"&gt;Captain Jytte&lt;/a&gt;, the famous privateer, to enter Castle Dour. Some historians claim that she and the High King were simply attempting to keep their business dealings quiet. Others believe the Jytte and Erling were involved on a more personal level.\nAt the end of the bridge is the windmill. The tower and the windmill serve as one of Solitude's most recognizable man-made landmarks. The Windmill's power was once used to open the gates to what is now the &lt;a href=\"East%20Empire%20Company%20Warehouse\"&gt;East Empire Company Warehouse&lt;/a&gt;, but today that task falls to the strong backs of the dock workers.\nIn the shadow of the windmill you'll find the outdoor market and the well. Here, you can buy a number of local delicacies including famous &lt;a href=\"spiced%20wine\"&gt;spiced wine&lt;/a&gt; made exclusively in Solitude.\nFrom here we'll travel up the ramp and into Castle Dour Courtyard.\nCastle Dour\nAs you enter the courtyard of Castle Dour, you are confronted with the banner of Solitude hanging over the door to what is now Castle Dour proper.\nAt the far end of the courtyard stands the impressive &lt;a href=\"Temple%20of%20the%20Divines%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Temple of the Divines&lt;/a&gt;. The founders of Solitude were deeply devout and Solitude is the only place in Skyrim where all of the &lt;a href=\"Nine%20Divines\"&gt;divines&lt;/a&gt; are worshipped in a single temple. All three of the buildings here are well worth taking a look inside, but only Temple and Castle Dour's military wing are open.\nIf you do venture inside the temple, take special note of the alcoves at the front. You can see the empty alcove that once held the shrine of &lt;a href=\"Talos\"&gt;Talos&lt;/a&gt; before Talos worship was outlawed.\nFrom the courtyard, travel out the exit between Castle Dour and the Temple and you'll get your first sight of the Blue Palace. Along the way, be sure to stop outside Bards College, a large building on your left marked by the Flames of Callisos burning beside the steps.\nNamed for a famous bard, it is said that as long as the flame burns, the college will stand.\n&lt;a href=\"Bards%20College%20%28Skyrim%20Location%29\"&gt;Bards College&lt;/a&gt;\nLooking up from the Bards College steps, you can see that the college stands taller than the Blue Palace itself. The bards who train here can be heard throughout Skyrim, singing songs that capture the history of ages. If you get a chance you should be sure to catch the &lt;a href=\"Burning%20of%20King%20Olaf\"&gt;Burning of King Olaf&lt;/a&gt;, an ancient festival where \"&lt;a href=\"Olaf\"&gt;King Olaf&lt;/a&gt;\" is burned in effigy.\nContinue up the road from the college and you'll reach the courtyard of the Blue Palace, our final destination.\nThe Blue Palace\nThe Blue Palace is home to the &lt;a href=\"Jarl\"&gt;Jarl&lt;/a&gt;s of Solitude, who for centuries have also served as the High Kings and High Queens of Skyrim. The northeast wing, on your left as you enter, holds the living quarters of the Jarl and her court on the top level and various servants below.\nThe southwest wing, known as the &lt;a href=\"Blue%20Palace%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Pelagius Wing&lt;/a&gt;, has fallen into a state of disrepair. Named for the famous High King, &lt;a href=\"Pelagius%20the%20Mad\"&gt;Pelagius the Mad&lt;/a&gt;, the wing is rumored to be haunted by the king's ghost. The wing has been locked and left alone since shortly after Pelagius's death.\nYou should be sure to venture inside the Blue Palace. The grand atrium and court chambers are a sight not to be missed.\nOther Points of Interest\nSpatior has shown you Solitude in all its grandeur, but there are a few places more to see. The walls of the city are easily accessible and well worth the climbing for the remarkable view. The Solitude Docks are also worth a visit, as they are the largest in Skyrim.\nThat's all for Walking the World Volume XI. Spatior does not know his next destination yet, but you can be sure that where he does go he will leave you a record of the best things to see.\nSpatior Munius, World Traveler"}

Walks was brought into the Velmont Family as a slave at a very young age. He and Anais Velmont grew up side-by-side, and as such were very close. Walks-Softly considered him and Anais as best friends, though Anais viewed him as property.\nWhen Walks was in his teens, the Velmont Family went on an extended trip to &lt;a href=\"Black%20Marsh%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Black Marsh&lt;/a&gt;. Anais invited Walks to come with them, though he refused, preferring to instead remain in &lt;a href=\"Abah%27s%20Landing\"&gt;Abah's Landing&lt;/a&gt;. In time Walks went to the streets, becoming a guttersnipe who posed as \"a beggar, a merchant, and a fire juggler, depending on the day of the week\" for coin and food. &lt;a href=\"Bright%20Ilmund\"&gt;Bright Ilmund&lt;/a&gt;, the leader &lt;a href=\"Thieves%20Guild%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Thieves Guild&lt;/a&gt;, would sometimes beat and shake down Walks-Softly. &lt;a href=\"Zeira\"&gt;Zeira&lt;/a&gt;, a member of the Guild, would often come to Walks seeking information he'd witnessed, and would pay him more coin than average, occasionally giving him food.\nWhen Zeira learned that Walks would pose as different roles for money, she was not ashamed, but instead impressed, offering him a place in the Guild. He initially refused, and Zeira did not push him to accept. After &lt;a href=\"Nicolas\"&gt;Nicolas&lt;/a&gt; became the &lt;a href=\"Guildmaster\"&gt;Guildmaster&lt;/a&gt; at around &lt;a href=\"2E%20556\"&gt;2E 556&lt;/a&gt;, Walks learned that the rules of the group had changed and now prohibited harming beggars. Walks changed his mind, and told Zeira that he now wished to join the Guild.\nInteractions.\nMain Quest.\n&lt;a href=\"Partners%20in%20Crime\"&gt;Partners in Crime&lt;/a&gt;.\nWalks-Softly will meet you in the catacombs beneath &lt;a href=\"Fulstrom%20Homestead\"&gt;Fulstrom Homestead&lt;/a&gt;, and free you from the jail cell if you chose to surrender. He and &lt;a href=\"Quen\"&gt;Quen&lt;/a&gt; will then have the following conversation:\nQuenneth: \"Who are you?\"\nWalks-Softly: \"\"You don't know me yet, but I'm a friend. Quen, isn't it?
