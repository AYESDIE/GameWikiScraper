She will tell you that this place is under attack by Colovians. She sent three of her best scouts into the field to find out what the Colovians are doing here, but they have yet to report back. She will send you in to talk to these scouts and discover what is going on.\nYou will find Scout Panamar immediately to the north.

He does not know the nature of this relic, but &lt;a href=\"Razum-dar%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Razum-dar&lt;/a&gt;, who is also present at this site, does. After you have spoken with him, head southeast to find Juluda-Daro. She will be standing over the dead bodies of some Colovians. She will tell you that Razum-dar went into the ruins with a group of soldiers, but that the Colovians sealed the entrance by stealing a pair of Welkynd Stones. Finally, head to the north side of the ruins to find the last scout, Annathiel. She has tracked the welkynd stones; they are being guarded by powerful mages. \nHead into the tent camp Annathiel was watching and search the chest next to the second tent on the left; you will find one of the welkynd stones there. The second stone is further ahead, in the big tent. Take both of them to the ruins' entrance in the center of the area and place them on the sconces. This will allow you to enter the vault. Head in and start your search for Razum-dar. You will find a wounded Colovian soldier named &lt;a href=\"Gratidia%20Arius\"&gt;Gratidia Arius&lt;/a&gt; who will tell you that Razum-dar has been cornered and will be killed soon, and that they are here for the Circlet of Elven Authority, which will give the wearer dominion over all elves. \nThe fire traps up ahead will periodically turn on and off. Make your way through carefully, then press the button on the other side. This will open the door ahead; proceed and you will find a bunch more traps. Time your traversal over the spike traps, so that the spikes are down when you cross, then head around the fire trap. More spike traps await; time your traversal well and press the button once you reach the other side. This will allow you access to the third hallway, which will feature no traps. On the far end, you will see Razum-dar behind a gate. Speak with him and he will tell you that the way back for him has collapsed; he cannot reach the Circlet right behind you. Thus, the task falls to you to solve the puzzle and claim the circlet. However, Raz will tell you that destroying the circlet will cause the defenses here to go haywire and kill him and his men, but he will still encourage you to do just that, as the circlet can only be destroyed here. \nTo claim the circlet, activate the buttons in the correct order: first the leftmost one, then the rightmost one, then the one left of the circlet, then the one right of the circlet. Once you have the circlet, it is time to decide whether to destroy it and sacrifice Raz's life, or to use it to depower the traps and allow Raz to escape. If you throw the circlet in the furnace, . If you use it to depower the Tower rune on the wall, the ruins will start to collapse. Head outside and speak with Raz there; he will not be happy with you. He will take the circlet from you and start looking for a new hiding place. This will finish the quest."}

She and her master, &lt;a href=\"Rurelion\"&gt;Rurelion&lt;/a&gt;, were shipwrecked, so they came to the temple when they heard that the water never ran dry\u2014referring to the &lt;a href=\"Mourning%20Stone\"&gt;Mourning Stone&lt;/a&gt;.\nBackground.\nGathwen, Rurelion, and &lt;a href=\"Ealcil\"&gt;Ealcil&lt;/a&gt; went on an expedition into the Temple of the Mourning springs prior to \"Tears of the Two Moons.\" They found the Mourning Stone, which, to them, was something of great use; however, upon grabbing it, &lt;a href=\"Undead%20%28Online%29\"&gt;undead&lt;/a&gt; legions attacked the party, causing Rurelion to be trapped inside the temple. Although Ealcil returned to Eagle's Strand, Gathwen remained, looking for someone to help get her master to safety.\nPersonality.\nGathwen is devoted to her master; she refuses to abandon him in the temple\u2014unlike Ealcil. Upon learning that &lt;a href=\"Uldor\"&gt;Uldor&lt;/a&gt; has control over Rurelion, she fears for him, and urges caution. She also appears to be modest, for when Rurelion suggests that he be sealed away with Uldor, and that Gathwen will be more powerful than him one day, she states that she is nothing compared to him, and that she can be lost without consequence.\nInteractions.\n&lt;a href=\"Tears%20of%20the%20Two%20Moons\"&gt;Tears of the Two Moons&lt;/a&gt;.\nUpon reaching the Temple of the Mourning Springs, she asks the &lt;a href=\"Vestige\"&gt;Vestige&lt;/a&gt; for help in saving her master, Rurelion, who has been unable to escape the temple. After accepting, the pair is warned by a skeleton, who tells that Rurelion is under his control, right before two wards are cast on the entrance to the catacombs. Gathwen tells how they must be dispelled before they can enter, which she volunteers to do. As the Vestige distracts the undead around both the scorpion and spider sigils, Gathwen takes them down, allowing for access into the catacombs.\nInside, Gathwen hints that the puzzle that would deactivate the barrier to the next room relates to the cycle of the two moons\u2014&lt;a href=\"Secunda\"&gt;Secunda&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Masser\"&gt;Masser&lt;/a&gt;. After the code is solved, she will advise caution before entering the next room.\nRurelion can be found inside the ritual room, but Gathwen will appear distressed; this is because he has been possessed by &lt;a href=\"Uldor\"&gt;Uldor&lt;/a&gt;, an undead &lt;a href=\"Maormer\"&gt;Maormer&lt;/a&gt; wizard, who explains his plan to take over &lt;a href=\"Eagle%27s%20Strand\"&gt;Eagle's Strand&lt;/a&gt; and then &lt;a href=\"Khenarthi%27s%20Roost\"&gt;Khenarthi's Roost&lt;/a&gt; by summoning more skeletons. As the Vestige kills his minions, she applies magic to the bone piles, making Uldor unable to use them anymore. After Rurelion fights for his body, Gathwen will instruct the Vestige to follow him alone as she takes a minute to rest.\nAfter deactivating the traps, Rurelion will suggest that he tells Uldor to take over his body while the Vestige places the Tears of the Two Moons on pedestals in the tomb, while Gathwen fetch the Mourning Stone to close off the area. Upon entering the Great Hall, she will come in and disagree with the plan, instead volunteering to sacrifice herself instead. The Vestige has to choose whether to seal Rurelion or Gathwen inside the tomb.\nIf Rurelion is chosen, then she will get the Mourning Stone from Eagle's Strand. After the Vestige emerges alone, she will swear that she will free Rurelion from Uldor eventually, rewarding the Vestige with the &lt;a href=\"Mourning%20Bow\"&gt;Mourning Bow&lt;/a&gt;.\nIf Gathwen is chosen, then she will instruct Uldor to take her over. As Uldor attempts to possess her, the Vestige must place the four Tears of the Two Moons on the pedastals. Once this has been done, she will give a final farewell, left trapped in the Temple of the Mourning Springs forever.\n&lt;a href=\"The%20Tempest%20Unleashed\"&gt;The Tempest Unleashed&lt;/a&gt;.\nIf Gathwen is chosen to live, then she will offer to help the Vestige battle the &lt;a href=\"Sea%20Vipers\"&gt;Sea Vipers&lt;/a&gt;.\n&lt;a href=\"Crossing%20the%20Chasm\"&gt;Crossing the Chasm&lt;/a&gt;.\nCross the chasm to strike at Molag Bal.\nCombat.\nIn combat, Gathwen serves as more of an auxiliary combatant, rarely engaging the enemy directly, but assisting the Vestige from behind.\nHealing Magic.\nGathwen can heal both herself and the Vestige during battle. Her spells can prove to be a useful assist in a battle against numerous enemies.\nCounter Spells.\nGathwen can dispel and derune numerous wards and rituals by Uldor. Although she does not use this ability directly in combat, her ability helps progress through the quest, and, therefore, fight less enemies overall.\nDialogue.\n\"Please, I need your help. My master's life is in danger!\"\nAfter solving the puzzle in the catacombs:\n\"When we entered the temple, that skeleton made it sound as though Rurelion was in grave danger. I won't let vague threats keep us from my master, but Rurelion is too important to lose. Perhaps we should think before we act.\"\nOnce Rurelion reveals his plan to sacrifice himself:\n\"Rurelion's plan is to let Uldor possess him! They'll both be sealed in the tomb, forever. But it doesn't need to be this way. Seal me inside.\" \nReturning to Gathwen before making a decision:\n\"Nothing you say will convince me. I'm sealing myself in that tomb.\"\nAfter defeating Uldor, if Gathwen was chosen to be sacrificed:\n\"The water weakens Uldor, but I can't hold him for long. Quickly, go to Rurelion.

He was all but erased from the annals of history by &lt;a href=\"Harald\"&gt;High King Harald&lt;/a&gt;.\nHistory.\nAs an Archmage at the beginning of the &lt;a href=\"First%20Era\"&gt;First Era&lt;/a&gt;, Gauldur was wise, wealthy, powerful, and honorable, so much so that he was revered throughout the North. Even the most powerful men of his time came to hear his wise words. He had three sons: &lt;a href=\"Jyrik%20Gauldurson\"&gt;Jyrik&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Mikrul%20Gauldurson\"&gt;Mikrul&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Sigdis%20Gauldurson\"&gt;Sigdis&lt;/a&gt;, who were overcast by their father's shadow. As a result, they grew resentful and cruel, desiring their father's power and prestige. Jyrik, the oldest of his sons, discovered that Gauldur's power stemmed from the &lt;a href=\"The%20Gauldur%20Amulet\"&gt;amulet&lt;/a&gt; which he wore at all times. He and his brothers conspired to kill their father and split the amulet and its power.\nGauldur's children had at last gained the power they sought, but they were cruel, evil men and used their newfound power to massacre the nearby villages. So extensive was the destruction that High King Harald sent a company of &lt;a href=\"battlemage\"&gt;battlemage&lt;/a&gt;s led by the &lt;a href=\"Arch-Mage\"&gt;Arch-Mage&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Geirmund\"&gt;Geirmund&lt;/a&gt; to destroy them. A great battle was fought, and the brothers were defeated and made to flee the field of battle. Geirmund pursued them and killed them, eventually giving his life to defeat the last of the brothers in a duel. The amulet fragments were magically sealed, along with each brother, in the place they were defeated. Once all the dead had been buried and the amulet sealed, the High King ordered all records of Gauldur and his sons destroyed, to forever seal away the power of the amulet.\nQuests.\n&lt;a href=\"Forbidden%20Legend\"&gt;Forbidden Legend&lt;/a&gt;.\n&lt;a href=\"Last%20Dragonborn\"&gt;The Dragonborn&lt;/a&gt; discovers that after the Gauldur brothers were defeated, their tombs were sealed and they were left as undead as punishment for their betrayal, theft, and murder. It is revealed, however, that the legend survived. The book &lt;a href=\"Lost%20Legends\"&gt;Lost Legends&lt;/a&gt; explains how the event began. &lt;a href=\"Daynas%20Valen\"&gt;Daynas Valen&lt;/a&gt;'s &lt;a href=\"Daynas%20Valen%27s%20Journal\"&gt;journals&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Daynas%20Valen%27s%20Notes\"&gt;notes&lt;/a&gt; explain the history, as well as his plan to acquire the amulet. Unfortunately, it went horribly wrong as he was killed inside one of the ruins and his corpse was abandoned. Each brother has a &lt;a href=\"Gauldur%20Amulet%20Fragment\"&gt;Gauldur Amulet Fragment&lt;/a&gt; and a unique weapon in addition to a &lt;a href=\"Writ%20of%20Sealing\"&gt;Writ of Sealing&lt;/a&gt;, punishing them for their crimes. &lt;a href=\"Sigdis%20Gauldurson\"&gt;Sigdis&lt;/a&gt; can be found in &lt;a href=\"Geirmund%27s%20Hall%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Geirmund's Hall&lt;/a&gt;. His weapon is the &lt;a href=\"Gauldur%20Blackbow\"&gt;Gauldur Blackbow&lt;/a&gt; and his fragment increases Stamina. &lt;a href=\"Jyrik%20Gauldurson\"&gt;Jyrik&lt;/a&gt; can be found in &lt;a href=\"Saarthal\"&gt;Saarthal&lt;/a&gt;. His weapon is the &lt;a href=\"Staff%20of%20Jyrik%20Gauldurson\"&gt;Staff of Jyrik Gauldurson&lt;/a&gt; and his fragment increases Magicka. &lt;a href=\"Mikrul%20Gauldurson\"&gt;Mikrul&lt;/a&gt; can be found in &lt;a href=\"Folgunthur\"&gt;Folgunthur&lt;/a&gt;. His weapon is the &lt;a href=\"Gauldur%20Blackblade\"&gt;Gauldur Blackblade&lt;/a&gt; and his fragment increases Health. An &lt;a href=\"Ancient%20Edict\"&gt;Ancient Edict&lt;/a&gt; can be found at &lt;a href=\"Reachwater%20Rock\"&gt;Reachwater Rock&lt;/a&gt;, warning adventurers and travelers to stay away from the corpses, and leave them alone to their rest. This is the place for the Dragonborn to go when reforging the amulet. After returning all three fragments and defeating all three ghosts, Gauldur's ghost will appear. Jyrik will say \"Gauldur!\" and Gauldur will banish the ghosts and reforge and give the Dragonborn the amulet as a reward."}

The Ogres captured the escarpment known as &lt;a href=\"Shinji%27s%20Scarp\"&gt;Shinji's Scarp&lt;/a&gt; leaving &lt;a href=\"Wayrest\"&gt;Wayrest&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Wind%20Keep\"&gt;Wind Keep&lt;/a&gt; open for an attack. The &lt;a href=\"Daggerfall%20Covenant\"&gt;Daggerfall Covenant&lt;/a&gt; sent in the &lt;a href=\"Murtag%20Clan\"&gt;Murtag Clan&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"Orsimer\"&gt;Orsimer&lt;/a&gt; to quell the Ogres. &lt;a href=\"General%20Godrun\"&gt;General Godrun&lt;/a&gt; lead the clan in the battle. &lt;a href=\"Abbot%20Durak\"&gt;Abbot Durak&lt;/a&gt; of the &lt;a href=\"Pariah%20Abbey\"&gt;Pariah Abbey&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Menevia\"&gt;Menevia&lt;/a&gt; sent a mysterious warrior known as the &lt;a href=\"Vestige\"&gt;Vestige&lt;/a&gt; to aid the Orcs at the Skirmish in Shinji's Scarp.

The &lt;a href=\"Supernal%20Dreamers\"&gt;Supernal Dreamers&lt;/a&gt; are a group of Vaermina worshippers that have spread their influence in &lt;a href=\"Firebrand%20Keep\"&gt;Firebrand Keep&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Alcaire\"&gt;Alcaire&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"At-Tura%20Estate\"&gt;At-Tura Estate&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Menevia\"&gt;Menevia&lt;/a&gt;.

The Vestige was sent into Godrun's Dream and defeated the &lt;a href=\"Omen%20of%20Betrayal\"&gt;Omen of Betrayal&lt;/a&gt; deep within his mind. The Vestige journeyed to the &lt;a href=\"Weeping%20Giant\"&gt;Weeping Giant&lt;/a&gt; landmark to seek aid from Azura.

I can sense you've already made the acquaintance of my unfortunate brother.\"\n&lt;a href=\"Ovis%20Velas\"&gt;my unfortunate brother&lt;/a&gt; \"Yes, Ovis always did like to take credit for my exploits. Too bad that this time, in trying to become my doppleganger, it would appear he went too far. I understand your position, [PC Name] -- you have to defend yourself. But I also must ask you to understand mine -- I have to avenge my brother. Thus, a duel is called for, and there is no time like the present. Prepare yourself, [PC Name]. Thy doom is imminent, and I have other matters to attend to.\""}

True, the substance produced by the formula looks and feels much like the rare ebony ore, but it is not ebony and any discerning craftsman will recognize this as soon as they use it to produce goods.\nI've tried to counsel Master Rethan on this subject, suggesting it may be wiser\u2014and equally profitable\u2014to instead focus on selling the alchemical concoction itself. Though the formula was exceedingly difficult to translate and requires extreme precision to brew properly, the reagents I require to produce it are not overly rare. I could easily produce large quantities. Imagine my airborne form used as a weapon! It would fetch a fine price.\nMaster Rethan disagrees. According to him, the buyers don't care if the ebony is false. So long as they can use it to produce goods that pass a cursory inspection they will be happy. Ebony is quite rare and difficult to come by. With us as the source, our buyers should be able to produce passable fakes then close shop before anyone discovers the deception. If a soldier dies on the battlefield because his ebony plate was not true, that's no money out of our buyers' pockets.\nPerhaps Master Rethan is right. I often underestimate the crude avarice that drives so many of my race. As for me, I am content to study and work with such a brilliant formula. Perhaps one day I will find a truer application for it."}

He has uncovered a lead on one of our most elusive enemies. The &lt;a href=\"Silken%20Ring\"&gt;Silken Ring&lt;/a&gt; know all our tricks, making it all but impossible to deal with their growing aggression. Somehow Tsatva-Lan has found their lair. We must act quickly if we are to root them out before they realize we know where to find them.\nI have been called upon to join Tsatva-Lan in our retribution against the Silken Ring. He plans for us to attack in force and purge the nest of our enemies. It is a rare thing to find so many Shadowscales directed to a single purpose. I will consider it a privilege to join in this slaughter for the glory of &lt;a href=\"Sithis\"&gt;Sithis&lt;/a&gt;.\nThis will not be an easy task. Tsatva-Lan has confided in me that there is evidence that the Silken Ring have more than their skill as assassins to thank for their success. They have tapped into a tangible power that makes them more deadly than they ever were before deserting their comrades in the &lt;a href=\"Dark%20Brotherhood%20%28Online%20Faction%29\"&gt;Dark Brotherhood&lt;/a&gt;, or &lt;a href=\"Morag%20Tong\"&gt;Morag Tong&lt;/a&gt;. That is why he has chosen to bring so many others on this errand and why he needs me at his side. We cannot afford to be divided in purpose or place to overcome this threat.\nTonight we descend into the pit that our enemies call home. Tsatva-Lan admits that he knows little about what lies within, but his spines are aligned in confidence and eagerness. I too feel the siren song of our enemy's pulse, it acts as the drum beat of our march and the anticipation of its quickening before falling silent is intoxicating. I would pity the Silken Ring, if I knew how."}

He will tell you to go speak to &lt;a href=\"Daljari%20Half-Troll\"&gt;Daljari Half-Troll&lt;/a&gt; for the test of might, to &lt;a href=\"Iroda\"&gt;Iroda&lt;/a&gt; for the test of wit and to &lt;a href=\"Widulf\"&gt;Widulf&lt;/a&gt; for the test of spirit. These tests are considered separate quests and have detailed walkthroughs on &lt;a href=\"Trial%20of%20the%20Body\"&gt;their&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Trial%20of%20the%20Mind\"&gt;own&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Trial%20of%20the%20Spirit\"&gt;pages&lt;/a&gt;. \nOnce you have completed all three trials, return to Thane Vofknir to report your progress. Follow him to the balcony and listen to his speech. After he cheers to you, &lt;a href=\"Runehild\"&gt;Runehild&lt;/a&gt; will come running towards the crowd to warn of giants. Speak to her and she will tell you that Jakaral and the skalds are trapped in the giant's camp. This will finish the quest and start the next one, &lt;a href=\"Save%20Your%20Voice\"&gt;Save Your Voice&lt;/a&gt;."}

We've covered most of the remainder of the outer guard tower, and scoured the crumbled gatehouse ruins, but not one clue has arisen as to where it may have been buried.\nIt's quiet out here, as if the ruins were paying respects to the &lt;a href=\"Ayleid\"&gt;Ayleid&lt;/a&gt; inhabitants that disappeared here long ago. We haven't encountered anything hostile, but if we do, I think we're ready. The Brotherhood's been in worse scrapes before. &lt;a href=\"Bradon%20Lirrian\"&gt;Bradon&lt;/a&gt; paid good money for the information as to our treasure's whereabouts, and I hope it doesn't turn out to be yet another fiasco.\nThis morning, our camp was set upon by some bandits who were protecting what they claimed was their territory. Considering that we were outnumbered three to one, we did very well. Only &lt;a href=\"Raynil%20Dralas\"&gt;Raynil&lt;/a&gt; suffered a small wound, but that was easily healed by a potion that Bradon had thoughtfully brought with him on our expedition.\nAfter getting rid of the bandit's corpses, we set out to tackle the largest part of the ruin, the remains of the great keep. Two of the walls of the once-mighty structure were collapsed, scattering the telltale whitish rock so typical of the Ayleid architecture in this part of &lt;a href=\"Tamriel\"&gt;Tamriel&lt;/a&gt;. This made our assault on the ruin difficult, as many of the larger chunks of wall were far too heavy for us to move.\nBradon suggested that we search the center of the building's foundation for any underground entrances, which was typical for this type of keep. His guess paid off, and after several hours of backbreaking work, we managed to clear an opening just large enough for us to squeeze through and enter an ancient stairwell leading down into the ground. We decided to wait until morning's light to begin our descent into the depths of the ruin.\nAfter a restless sleep, all of us were quite excited at the prospect of what might lie ahead. Eagerly, we dipped our torches in a fresh container of pitch, lit them, and entered the inky blackness of the stairwell.\nThe stale air was choked with dust and fine grit, a sign that no one had entered this portion of the ruins in a very long time. We became excited, as that meant no other tomb robbers had gotten there before us.\nThe stairwell eventually leveled out into a corridor of sorts that snaked its way to the north. As we carefully walked along, I scanned the floor and walls very carefully for any type of triggers, tripwires or pressure plates; such was my specialty. The Ayleid were well known for their cunning traps protecting their tombs, and I wasn't taking any chances.\nBradon, the scholar of the Brotherhood, was getting more and more excited as we traversed the passage; he was translating the wall carvings and was becoming certain that we had finally found the true location of our prize. After walking for several more minutes, we were overjoyed to see what we were hoping to see: the hallway ended at a metal door with the carving of a spider upon it.\nNow came the true test of Bradon's information. The door supposedly had a puzzle lock; by pulling the spider legs in a certain combination, it would unlatch. The wrong combination would spell our deaths, perhaps triggering a collapse of the hallway or some other equally deadly trap. With a shaky hand, I pulled the legs one by one in the order I had memorized: the sixth one, then the first one, the second one, the eighth one, and finally the first one again.\nI closed my eyes, as there were a few loud clicks and then the door popped open. We all breathed a sigh of relief. Pushing open the door, I looked in at a huge room with a pedestal at the center. Sitting on the pedestal illuminated by a shaft of sunlight from a tiny hole in the ceiling was our prize.\nThe floor was covered in a huge mosaic of a stylized spider, all eight of its legs coming to a point and ending up at the door entrance. This was the last of the traps the Ayleid left behind to protect their treasure. Again, if it hadn't been for Bradon's skill at acquiring information, we may never had known how to solve this last line of defense.\nI instructed Bradon and Raynil to remain at the entrance and to tie a rope around my waist in case of a sudden pitfall. Carefully, I began to walk on the darkened tiles that formed the third leg of the spider. Sweat beaded on my forehead, as the pathway made by the tiny pieces of ceramic was very narrow at the start, and one slip could again mean instant death.\nBut death never arrived. The information had been correct, and I was able to make it to the pedestal and secure the artifact! Quickly as possible, we made our way back and out into the daylight. Once again, the Brotherhood was triumphant and it was time to return home.\nAt the tavern that night, we decided to make a pact. We would stash the artifact in a cave not far from Bruma until we researched it further. An item of its magnitude could be very dangerous if mishandled, and we certainly didn't want to sell it without understanding its true value. Bradon agreed to contract a local cooper to construct a chest with three locks. Each of us would hold a key to one of the locks so none would have access to the artifact without the others being present. For the rest of the evening, we drank merrily and sang many a song of adventures passed, and adventures to come."}

The note contains small details she was able to gather regarding the way to learn the spell of the same &lt;a href=\"Finger%20of%20the%20Mountain\"&gt;name&lt;/a&gt;.\nContents.\nMy dear helper:\nMost of the text you've given me is well beyond your comprehension, I'm afraid. I found one section, however, that had been appended by the keepers of the Imperial Watch, and their notes will be of use to you.\nReturn to the ruins of &lt;a href=\"Cloud%20Top\"&gt;Cloud Top&lt;/a&gt;. There you should find a section of pillar that looks remarkably unlike any other stonework present. The carvings on this pillar were made by the &lt;a href=\"Ayleid\"&gt;Ayleid&lt;/a&gt;s, and the pillar has been infused with significant power.\nThe following was scribbled in the margins of the book, presumably by the same men who took the pillar from its original resting place. The notes are smeared in places, so I have included what I could decipher. Do note that this sounds rather dangerous, and take whatever precautions you feel are necessary.\n\"... only seems to function outdoors, where it reacts strongly to magic... terrible power, capable of striking a man dead on the spot...\"\n\"...transported the stone to a secure location, in order to study it more fully...\"\n\"...guild wizards brought in to focus power of stone.

Success means powers of shock unattainable through other means. \"\nFrom these notes, and the original Ayleid inscriptions, it seems that our &lt;a href=\"Imperials%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;Imperial&lt;/a&gt; friends were attempting to harness some degree of the Ayleid's magical power, and were marginally successful. I suggest you procure a Welkynd stone for yourself (searching Ayleid ruins will likely be the quickest method of acquiring one) and return to Cloud Top to cast a shock spell at the pillar.\nWhat happens then, I think you can comprehend on your own.\n-&lt;a href=\"Earana\"&gt;E&lt;/a&gt;"}

It is also a joinable &lt;a href=\"Factions%20%28Morrowind%29\"&gt;faction&lt;/a&gt; in expansion , and is also encountered in .\nHistory.\nThird Era.\nWhen exactly the East Empire Company was founded is unknown, but it first appeared in . It is however known that it has existed at least for 5 centuries in &lt;a href=\"4E%20201\"&gt;4E 201&lt;/a&gt;, meaning that it has existed since at least &lt;a href=\"3E%20134\"&gt;3E 134&lt;/a&gt;.\nIn the year &lt;a href=\"3E%20427\"&gt;3E 427&lt;/a&gt;, the East Empire Company had holdings on Vvardenfell district of Morrowind, with &lt;a href=\"Ebonheart\"&gt;Ebonheart&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Caldera\"&gt;Caldera&lt;/a&gt; being noteworthy locations.\nThey also sought to expand to &lt;a href=\"Solstheim\"&gt;Solstheim&lt;/a&gt; due to the large quantity of Raw Ebony which was found there. In a few months, the town known as &lt;a href=\"Raven%20Rock\"&gt;Raven Rock&lt;/a&gt; was built, where employees of the Company started mining for Ebony. Though some competition existed between the lawful ruler of the land, &lt;a href=\"Carnius%20Magius\"&gt;Carnius Magius&lt;/a&gt;, and his second-in-command, &lt;a href=\"Falco%20Galenus\"&gt;Falco Galenus&lt;/a&gt;, this proved to ultimately be no problem for the Company's interests. The ebony that the town yielded was exported to &lt;a href=\"Windhelm\"&gt;Windhelm&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Skyrim\"&gt;Skyrim&lt;/a&gt;. Only 5 years later, the town was home to over 30 people, most of which relied on the mine for an income. The town was nearly exclusively &lt;a href=\"Imperial\"&gt;Imperial&lt;/a&gt;, though some &lt;a href=\"Nords\"&gt;Nords&lt;/a&gt; were drawn to the town as well due to the value of the ebony. Prior to the &lt;a href=\"Oblivion%20Crisis\"&gt;Oblivion Crisis&lt;/a&gt; breaking out, the Nords of Solstheim sought to conquer the island of &lt;a href=\"Solstheim\"&gt;Solstheim&lt;/a&gt;, fighting against the garrison of Raven Rock, which was stationed at &lt;a href=\"Fort%20Frostmoth\"&gt;Fort Frostmoth&lt;/a&gt;. Though many Imperial soldiers died, the Nords were unsuccesful in claiming the island. It is unknown if the wealth of Raven Rock played a part in this.\nWhen the Oblivion Crisis did take place, it was said that Raven Rock was spared most of its damage due to there being no record of &lt;a href=\"Oblivion%20Gate\"&gt;Oblivion Gate&lt;/a&gt;s on Solstheim. As a result, everyone was still going to work as they had done the years before. What happened to the guard force stationed on Solstheim is contradicted. While \"&lt;a href=\"History%20of%20Raven%20Rock%2C%20Vol.%20I\"&gt;History of Raven Rock, Vol. I&lt;/a&gt;\" claims that the bulk of the Legionnaires stationed on Solstheim were recalled to &lt;a href=\"Cyrodiil\"&gt;Cyrodiil&lt;/a&gt;, Chancellor &lt;a href=\"Ocato\"&gt;Ocato&lt;/a&gt; of the &lt;a href=\"Elder%20Council\"&gt;Elder Council&lt;/a&gt; said that he had been pleading for troops for Cyrodiil for weeks, but was not granted them due to the Imperial army already being fully committed in the other provinces. Ocato also did not want to risk the other provinces becoming upset and resulting in a full-scale political crisis by him recalling the Legions.\nFourth Era.\nAfter the Oblivion Crisis had ended and the &lt;a href=\"Fourth%20Era\"&gt;Fourth Era&lt;/a&gt; began, &lt;a href=\"House%20Redoran\"&gt;House Redoran&lt;/a&gt;, which had lost &lt;a href=\"Ald%27ruhn\"&gt;Ald'ruhn&lt;/a&gt;, negotiated with the Company on being allowed entry to the town. The Company agreed, and the Redoran began to follow the mining live. The situation was well under control until in &lt;a href=\"4E%205\"&gt;4E 5&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"Red%20Mountain\"&gt;Red Mountain&lt;/a&gt; erupted, resulting in the garrison at Fort Frostmoth being wiped out. While the Company itself had created a wall while constructing Raven Rock, it was destroyed by the events of the eruption. Most of the population of Raven Rock was, ironically, saved by working in the mine, as the people were safe from the blast. Due to the destruction of Fort Frostmoth, there were only a few guards, as the others had died during the eruption. Due to this, Brara Morvayn brought in the &lt;a href=\"Redoran%20Guard\"&gt;Redoran Guard&lt;/a&gt; to replace the fallen Imperial soldiers, and have been guarding the city ever since. During this time, the ash storms from the eruption made life on Raven Rock difficult. As such, &lt;a href=\"Brara%20Morvayn\"&gt;Brara Morvayn&lt;/a&gt; proposed to construct the &lt;a href=\"Bulwark\"&gt;Bulwark&lt;/a&gt;, a wall surrounding Raven Rock in defense against the ash storms. Morvayn's idea was quickly accepted and funded by the company, and resulted in the population being able to work as they had done before. In &lt;a href=\"4E%2010\"&gt;4E 10&lt;/a&gt;, the Company asked &lt;a href=\"Gratian%20Caerellius\"&gt;Gratian Caerellius&lt;/a&gt; to go to Solstheim due to the uncovery of a &lt;a href=\"Bloodskal%20Barrow\"&gt;Nordic burial&lt;/a&gt; under the Raven Rock Mines, due to him being from Solstheim originally. This investigation would prove to be a waste of time, however, as Gratian died when he tried to take the &lt;a href=\"Bloodskal%20Blade\"&gt;Bloodskal Blade&lt;/a&gt; with him to the outside world, due to being beset by &lt;a href=\"Draugr\"&gt;Draugr&lt;/a&gt;. In &lt;a href=\"4E%2016\"&gt;4E 16&lt;/a&gt;, when Skyrim offered Solstheim to the &lt;a href=\"Dunmer\"&gt;Dunmer&lt;/a&gt; people, the Company had to abandon the settlement due to Morrowind being independent from the Empire. As a result of the power changing hands from the Company to the Redoran, most Imperials left the town and returned to Cyrodiil. In &lt;a href=\"4E%20201\"&gt;4E 201&lt;/a&gt;, a local Dunmer of Raven Rock, &lt;a href=\"Fethis%20Alor\"&gt;Fethis Alor&lt;/a&gt; asked in a letter to &lt;a href=\"Vittoria%20Vici\"&gt;Vittoria Vici&lt;/a&gt; if the Company wanted to buy his business on Raven Rock, but was declined due to the Company not seeing any financial advantage to setting up business on the island of Solstheim.\nIn Skyrim, the &lt;a href=\"Thieves%20Guild\"&gt;Thieves Guild&lt;/a&gt; was trying to gain some influence in the company, but were ultimately unsuccesful. At the same time, the Company itself had problems with pirates, resulting in Solitude's Warehouse not getting new shipments, and the office in Windhelm not being able to function. Due to the lack of soldiers as a result of the &lt;a href=\"Skyrim%20Civil%20War\"&gt;Skyrim Civil War&lt;/a&gt;, the company itself had limited forces to spare. Sending troops out would result in less security for the company. Aside from which, they did not know the base of operations of the pirates, nor did they think attacking single ships would solve the problem. It turned out that &lt;a href=\"Clan%20Shatter-Shield\"&gt;Clan Shatter-Shield&lt;/a&gt; had been hiring the &lt;a href=\"Blood%20Horker\"&gt;Blood Horker&lt;/a&gt; pirates to raid the East Empire Company's ships, while their own shipments would gain more profit due to the lack of alternatives. After the pirate issue was resolved, the Company would not dock ships in &lt;a href=\"Windhelm\"&gt;Windhelm&lt;/a&gt;, but Solitude regained its trade, Windhelm would now be used for paperwork.\nLocations.\nThe East Empire trading company has holdings in many eastern territories of the &lt;a href=\"Cyrodilic%20Empire\"&gt;Cyrodilic Empire&lt;/a&gt;, such as &lt;a href=\"Morrowind\"&gt;Morrowind&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Skyrim\"&gt;Skyrim&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Solstheim\"&gt;Solstheim&lt;/a&gt;. The company owns the &lt;a href=\"East%20Empire%20Company%20Warehouse\"&gt;East Empire Company Warehouse&lt;/a&gt; just outside of &lt;a href=\"Solitude%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Solitude&lt;/a&gt; and offices in &lt;a href=\"Windhelm%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Windhelm&lt;/a&gt;. It has a monopoly over trade in the Eastern Provinces, this is primarily due to the fact that the company is chartered by the &lt;a href=\"Emperor\"&gt;Emperor&lt;/a&gt; of Tamriel, whose Legions also protect it.\nTrade.\nThe East Empire Company controls the trade of &lt;a href=\"Kwama%20Egg\"&gt;kwama eggs&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Telvanni%20Bug%20Musk\"&gt;Telvanni Bug Musk&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"mazte\"&gt;mazte&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"sujamma\"&gt;sujamma&lt;/a&gt; and other local products of Morrowind as well as imports, such as &lt;a href=\"flin\"&gt;flin&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Cyrodiilic%20Brandy\"&gt;Cyrodiilic Brandy&lt;/a&gt;. The high price of flin imports may be attributed to the Company's complete control on prices, due to lack of competition. In Morrowind, they have made the trade of &lt;a href=\"Raw%20Ebony\"&gt;Raw Ebony&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Dwemer\"&gt;Dwemer&lt;/a&gt; artifacts illegal. Those under the employ of the Company can get certificates which are worth a number of gold. These certificates can be used to pay off bounties.\nInfluences.\nMany senior ranking officers in the company are seen as corrupt and are resented by some people in the provinces, who see the businessmen as &lt;a href=\"Imperial\"&gt;Imperial&lt;/a&gt; colonials robbing the local resources. The East Empire Company provides employment and financial stability to the Empire. &lt;a href=\"House%20Hlaalu\"&gt;House Hlaalu&lt;/a&gt; and the East Empire Company, who owns the &lt;a href=\"Caldera%20Mining%20Company\"&gt;Caldera Mining Company&lt;/a&gt;, in the town of &lt;a href=\"Caldera%20%28Morrowind%29\"&gt;Caldera&lt;/a&gt;, compete over ebony business.\nOffices.\nThe East Empire Company has offices in &lt;a href=\"Ebonheart%20%28Morrowind%29\"&gt;Ebonheart&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Caldera%20%28Morrowind%29\"&gt;Caldera&lt;/a&gt;,\u00a0&lt;a href=\"Fort%20Frostmoth%20%28Bloodmoon%29\"&gt;Fort Frostmoth&lt;/a&gt;\u00a0and the &lt;a href=\"Raw%20Ebony\"&gt;ebony&lt;/a&gt;\u00a0mining colony in &lt;a href=\"Raven%20Rock%20%28Bloodmoon%29\"&gt;Raven Rock&lt;/a&gt;\u00a0on &lt;a href=\"Solstheim%20%28Bloodmoon%29\"&gt;Solstheim&lt;/a&gt;\u00a0in &lt;a href=\"Morrowind\"&gt;Morrowind&lt;/a&gt;.\u00a0In Skyrim, the Company has offices in\u00a0&lt;a href=\"Windhelm%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Windhelm&lt;/a&gt;\u00a0and\u00a0a large warehouse and offices under &lt;a href=\"Solitude%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Solitude&lt;/a&gt;.\u00a0Its headquarters are in the &lt;a href=\"Imperial%20City\"&gt;Imperial City&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Cyrodiil\"&gt;Cyrodiil&lt;/a&gt;, it also has large warehouses in the &lt;a href=\"Waterfront%20District\"&gt;Waterfront District&lt;/a&gt; of the city.\nEvery company chapter is headed by a Factor who directs and controls the affairs of the company in his or her region.

Eastmarch and its capital, &lt;a href=\"Windhelm\"&gt;Windhelm&lt;/a&gt; was formerly the seat of power for the &lt;a href=\"Nordic%20Empire\"&gt;First Empire of the Nords&lt;/a&gt;, beginning with &lt;a href=\"Ysgramor\"&gt;Ysgramor&lt;/a&gt; and continuing through the &lt;a href=\"Ysgramor%20Dynasty\"&gt;Ysgramor Dynasty&lt;/a&gt;.\nDescription.\nGeography.\n&lt;a href=\"Frostwater%20Tundra\"&gt;Frostwater Tundra&lt;/a&gt;.\nIf there is one thing Eastmarch is known for, it is the volcanic sulfur pools of &lt;a href=\"Aalto\"&gt;Aalto&lt;/a&gt;, which spans the entirety of central Eastmarch, in the region of the Frostwater Tundra. The Tundra consists of the forested highlands to the west, as well as the sulfur pools. The stronghold of &lt;a href=\"Fort%20Amol\"&gt;Fort Amol&lt;/a&gt; is the largest settlement in the area, and it serves as the regional fort of Windhelm. The &lt;a href=\"Darkwater%20River\"&gt;Darkwater River&lt;/a&gt; runs throughout the region, near Amol and the &lt;a href=\"Darkwater%20Crossing\"&gt;Darkwater Crossing&lt;/a&gt;. It continues into the White River that goes north. The ancient monastery of &lt;a href=\"Mistwatch\"&gt;Mistwatch&lt;/a&gt; is the home of the &lt;a href=\"Ternion%20Monks\"&gt;Ternion Monks&lt;/a&gt;, who are one of the few worshippers of the &lt;a href=\"Ancient%20Nordic%20Pantheon\"&gt;Ancient Nordic Pantheon&lt;/a&gt; that still exists in Skyrim. Many come to the Sulfur Pools to have a relaxing hot bath.\n&lt;a href=\"Giant%27s%20Run\"&gt;Giant's Run&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe region of Giant's Run is situated on the edge of Skyrim's winter front, before the boreal forests that inhabit the central province. The city-state of &lt;a href=\"Windhelm\"&gt;Windhelm&lt;/a&gt; is located in the region, along the &lt;a href=\"Yorgrim%20River\"&gt;Yorgrim River&lt;/a&gt; that flows towards the &lt;a href=\"Sea%20of%20Ghosts\"&gt;Sea of Ghosts&lt;/a&gt;. Many settlements including &lt;a href=\"Lower%20Yorgrim\"&gt;Lower Yorgrim&lt;/a&gt; live along the Yorgrim, feeding off the fish that swim down the river. To the south is the sacred forest of &lt;a href=\"Kynesgrove\"&gt;Kynesgrove&lt;/a&gt;, which is named after &lt;a href=\"Kyne\"&gt;Kyne&lt;/a&gt;, the Shield-Maiden of Shor. Putting any damage on Kynesgrove is considered a grave offense in Eastmarch. To the east connecting the city-state of &lt;a href=\"Blacklight\"&gt;Blacklight&lt;/a&gt; is &lt;a href=\"Dunmeth%20Pass\"&gt;Dunmeth Pass&lt;/a&gt;, a prominent road that connects each province's influential cities.\n&lt;a href=\"Icewind%20Peaks\"&gt;Icewind Peaks&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe region of Icewind Peaks is largely uninhabitable, with the biggest settlement being the village of &lt;a href=\"Cragwallow\"&gt;Cragwallow&lt;/a&gt;, which contains mainly a mead hall. The ruins of &lt;a href=\"Mzulft\"&gt;Mzulft&lt;/a&gt; was one of the biggest cities in the Dwarven Empire in Skyrim, being one of the main producers of &lt;a href=\"Aetherium\"&gt;Aetherium&lt;/a&gt; before their battle against &lt;a href=\"King%20Gellir\"&gt;King Gellir&lt;/a&gt; and his onslaught. The ruined temple of &lt;a href=\"Skuldafn\"&gt;Skuldafn&lt;/a&gt; sits high among the &lt;a href=\"Velothi%20Mountains\"&gt;Velothi Mountains&lt;/a&gt;, containing a portal to &lt;a href=\"Sovngarde%20%28Location%29\"&gt;Sovngarde&lt;/a&gt;, the Nordic afterlife. Deep in the mountains is the ruined castle of &lt;a href=\"Direfrost%20Keep\"&gt;Direfrost Keep&lt;/a&gt;, which is the home of the famous witch hunter group that massacred the witches and hags of Eastmarch, the &lt;a href=\"Direfrost%20Clan\"&gt;Direfrost Clan&lt;/a&gt;.\nFauna.\nWolves &amp; Draugulf.\nJust like other parts of the continent, the &lt;a href=\"Wolves\"&gt;Wolves&lt;/a&gt; are common predators that appear throughout forest and hills in Eastmarch. The Wolf is one of the animals worshipped in the &lt;a href=\"Ancient%20Nordic%20Pantheon\"&gt;Ancient Nordic Pantheon&lt;/a&gt;, which is the depiction of &lt;a href=\"Mara\"&gt;Mara&lt;/a&gt;, the Goddess of Love and Handmaiden of &lt;a href=\"Kyne\"&gt;Kyne&lt;/a&gt;, especially the Wolves found along the &lt;a href=\"White%20River\"&gt;White River&lt;/a&gt;. Wolves travel in packs of three and are known to carry the disease, &lt;a href=\"Rockjoint\"&gt;Rockjoint&lt;/a&gt;. The Ice Wolves are a much stronger variant, seen mainly in the Old Holds and the &lt;a href=\"Western%20Reach\"&gt;Western Reach&lt;/a&gt;. More often than thought, the Ice Wolves tend to be pack leaders, with regular gray wolves surrounding them. Of the most common forms of &lt;a href=\"Lycanthropy\"&gt;Lycanthropy&lt;/a&gt;, is the &lt;a href=\"Werewolf\"&gt;Werewolf&lt;/a&gt;, which is prevalent in the province of Skyrim. Those who commit to the form have made allegiance with &lt;a href=\"Hircine\"&gt;Hircine&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"Daedric%20Prince\"&gt;Daedric Prince&lt;/a&gt; of the Hunt. The &lt;a href=\"Icehammer%20Clan\"&gt;Icehammer Clan&lt;/a&gt; in modern-day &lt;a href=\"Cragwallow\"&gt;Cragwallow&lt;/a&gt; created an undead variation of the Wolf, known as the &lt;a href=\"Draugulf\"&gt;Draugulf&lt;/a&gt;. The Thane of the Icehammer Clan had killed priestess of Kyne and was sealed in the &lt;a href=\"Icehammer%27s%20Vault\"&gt;Icehammer's Vault&lt;/a&gt;, where he remained to create Draugulf, and wielding the &lt;a href=\"Spear%20of%20Bitter%20Mercy\"&gt;Spear of Bitter Mercy&lt;/a&gt;.\nBears.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Bear\"&gt;Bear&lt;/a&gt; is just as common as the Wolf, although they are more reserved and alone. Bears are found all along the region of Eastmarch, except in the volcanic springs of &lt;a href=\"Aalto\"&gt;Aalto&lt;/a&gt;, specifically in the Frostwater Tundra. The Bear is one of the animals worshipped in the &lt;a href=\"Ancient%20Nordic%20Pantheon\"&gt;Ancient Nordic Pantheon&lt;/a&gt;, which it is the depiction of &lt;a href=\"Tsun\"&gt;Tsun&lt;/a&gt;, the Nordic God of Trials and shield-thane of &lt;a href=\"Shor\"&gt;Shor&lt;/a&gt;. He is known for guarding the &lt;a href=\"Whalebone%20Bridge\"&gt;Whalebone Bridge&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Sovngarde%20%28Location%29\"&gt;Sovngarde&lt;/a&gt;. Bears are found alone and typically reside in dens throughout Skyrim, including in &lt;a href=\"Lost%20Knife%20Hideout\"&gt;Lost Knife Hideout&lt;/a&gt;. In Skyrim, Bears carried the disease known as &lt;a href=\"Bone%20Break%20Fever\"&gt;Bone Break Fever&lt;/a&gt;. There is a legend spread across Skyrim regarding the &lt;a href=\"Werebear\"&gt;Werebear&lt;/a&gt;. A type of &lt;a href=\"Lycanthropy\"&gt;Lycanthropy&lt;/a&gt; regarding the Bear. To protect your home from Werebears, you must rub &lt;a href=\"Canis%20Root\"&gt;Canis Root&lt;/a&gt; all over your walls before going to sleep. However, they are not legends, as packs have appeared in faraway &lt;a href=\"Solstheim\"&gt;Solstheim&lt;/a&gt;.\nDraugr &amp; Dragon Priests.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Draugr\"&gt;Draugr&lt;/a&gt; are very reminiscent to the &lt;a href=\"Zombie\"&gt;Zombie&lt;/a&gt;, which are found practically, anywhere else other than Skyrim. However, the Draugr are much different than a typical undead creature. Draugrs are found in Ancient Nordic Tombs that dot the province and are much more versatile than a Zombie, but not as dangerous as say a &lt;a href=\"Lich\"&gt;Lich&lt;/a&gt;. They wield Ancient Nordic Weapons, but are also known to carry Ebony Weapons and have an affinity with Ice Magic. Draugr can understand life-threatening situations, and understand something as a threat. The most powerful of Draugr are known as Deathlords, and can even possess the ability to use the &lt;a href=\"Thu%27um\"&gt;Thu'um&lt;/a&gt;. Legendary figures such as &lt;a href=\"Olaf%20One-Eye\"&gt;Olaf One-Eye&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Jyrik%20Gauldurson\"&gt;Jyrik Gauldurson&lt;/a&gt; have become Draugr as time passed since their death. The &lt;a href=\"Dragon%20Priest\"&gt;Dragon Priest&lt;/a&gt; is a different kind of Draugr, seen only in the ancient temples of the &lt;a href=\"Dragon%20Cult\"&gt;Dragon Cult&lt;/a&gt;. Dragon Priest were followers of the Dragon Cult, but are a type of undead that has remained active due to the eternal worship of their long-dead followers, who are buried with them. While Draugr are restless Nordic undead, the Dragon Priest are much different, as they take what little life energy is inside the Draugr. In Eastmarch, the most well-known Dragon Priest is &lt;a href=\"Nahkriin\"&gt;Nahkriin&lt;/a&gt;, who guards the passage into Sovngarde on &lt;a href=\"Skuldafn\"&gt;Skuldafn&lt;/a&gt;.\nGiants.\nThe frozen north of Tamriel host various creatures and civilization not seen anywhere else in Tamriel. Of the more well-known is the culture surrounding the &lt;a href=\"Giants\"&gt;Giants&lt;/a&gt;. Giants are humanoid, primal creatures of gargantuan size. Giants like in tribes, away from the cities of Skyrim, in places such as &lt;a href=\"Cradlecrush%20Rock\"&gt;Cradlecrush Rock&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Giant%27s%20Heart\"&gt;Giant's Heart&lt;/a&gt; in Eastmarch. They are semi-intelligent, with the ability to trade, create clothing, and even have an established language, known as &lt;a href=\"Giantish\"&gt;Giantish&lt;/a&gt;. Giants are known to trade with Nords, who offer cows to them. The only stock that Giants have is the &lt;a href=\"Mammoth\"&gt;Mammoth&lt;/a&gt;, primarily for resources, including the ability to produce &lt;a href=\"Mammoth%20Cheese\"&gt;Mammoth Cheese&lt;/a&gt;. Giant Camps are painted in traditional Giant art, for whatever reason is unknown. Members of a tribe gather for a ceremonial ritual and have even acknowledged the idea of honoring their dead. It is common to find male Giants, then female Giants, which is rather peculiar. The only known female Giants can be found in &lt;a href=\"Wrothgar\"&gt;Wrothgar&lt;/a&gt;, beyond the &lt;a href=\"Druadach%20Mountains\"&gt;Druadach Mountains&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;a href=\"Western%20Reach\"&gt;Western Reach&lt;/a&gt;. The origins of Giants are unknown, with many of them claiming they have ties to &lt;a href=\"Atmora\"&gt;Atmora&lt;/a&gt; in the far north.\nFrost Atronach.\n&lt;a href=\"Atronach\"&gt;Atronach&lt;/a&gt;s, otherwise known as Elemental Daedra, are a variation of Daedra made with an affinity of a specific element. &lt;a href=\"Conjurer\"&gt;Conjurer&lt;/a&gt;s have commonly used Atronachs in combat. The &lt;a href=\"Frost%20Atronach\"&gt;Frost Atronach&lt;/a&gt; specifically, are hulking Daedra made out of sheer ice. Typically, Frost Atronachs are more used in the north, in Skyrim, the Western Reach, or even &lt;a href=\"Solstheim\"&gt;Solstheim&lt;/a&gt;, because of the naturally cold weather. The Mages of Skyrim, including those of the &lt;a href=\"College%20of%20Winterhold\"&gt;College of Winterhold&lt;/a&gt;, and even the long-dead Draugr Wight of Nordic Tombs. When the Nordic Witch, &lt;a href=\"Drodda%20of%20Icereach\"&gt;Drodda of Icereach&lt;/a&gt; occupied &lt;a href=\"Direfrost%20Keep\"&gt;Direfrost Keep&lt;/a&gt; for many years, she utilized Frost Atronachs, guarding the halls against adventurers and Direfrost attempting to reclaim their birthright. The &lt;a href=\"Frost%20Monarch\"&gt;Frost Monarch&lt;/a&gt; is a much stronger variant, having ties to the &lt;a href=\"Ice%20Blade%20of%20the%20Monarch\"&gt;Ice Blade of the Monarch&lt;/a&gt;, an ancient claymore infused with the soul of a Frost Monarch. The blade has disappeared since its creator, &lt;a href=\"Almion%20Celmo\"&gt;Almion Celmo&lt;/a&gt; was imprisoned.\nFlora.\nEastmarch is fairly well-forested, all around the &lt;a href=\"Aalto\"&gt;Aalto&lt;/a&gt; springs, especially towards the &lt;a href=\"Whiterun%20Hold\"&gt;Whiterun Hold&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"the%20Rift\"&gt;the Rift&lt;/a&gt; in the south. The forests in Eastmarch are sacred to the people, especially the woods of &lt;a href=\"Kynesgrove\"&gt;Kynesgrove&lt;/a&gt;, situated south of the city-state of Windhelm. Kynesgrove is named after &lt;a href=\"Kyne\"&gt;Kyne&lt;/a&gt;, the Nordic Goddess of Storms, who guided the &lt;a href=\"Five%20Hundred%20Companions\"&gt;Five Hundred Companions&lt;/a&gt; across the &lt;a href=\"Sea%20of%20Ghosts\"&gt;Sea of Ghosts&lt;/a&gt; and into Mereth. It is considered a crime to defile Kynesgrove, considering its connection. The &lt;a href=\"Keepers%20of%20the%20Grove\"&gt;Keepers of the Grove&lt;/a&gt; maintain the area, as well as, offer daily sacraments and tributes. Many pilgrims flock to the settlement, where they can pray freely. Soldiers going to war would often pray at Kynesgrove, before heading to their possible fate. But beyond that, the pine forest is considered prime hunting grounds in Eastmarch, specifically for Bears. Several witches even hideout in the forest, to continue their experiments as they see fit. Speaking of Aalto, the area produces a special kind of &lt;a href=\"Jazbay%20Grapes\"&gt;Jazbay Grapes&lt;/a&gt;, that is made into wine that even the &lt;a href=\"Emperor\"&gt;Emperor&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"Cyrodiil\"&gt;Cyrodiil&lt;/a&gt; desires. But they require permission from the &lt;a href=\"Elder%20Council\"&gt;Elder Council&lt;/a&gt;.\nWhile Kynesgrove is considered sacred ground, the &lt;a href=\"Eldergleam%20Tree\"&gt;Eldergleam Tree&lt;/a&gt; is heavily worshipped, with many taking pilgrimages to the &lt;a href=\"Eldergleam%20Sanctuary\"&gt;Eldergleam Sanctuary&lt;/a&gt;, to bask in its glory. The Eldergleam is considered the oldest tree in all of Skyrim, and quite possibly all of Tamriel. According to legend, the Eldergleam was a sapling when the &lt;a href=\"Atmorans\"&gt;Atmorans&lt;/a&gt; brought it from the far north. The &lt;a href=\"Gildergreen\"&gt;Gildergreen&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Whiterun\"&gt;Whiterun&lt;/a&gt; was created from the Eldergleam, back when the settlement was originally founded. Many followers of &lt;a href=\"Kynareth\"&gt;Kynareth&lt;/a&gt; travel to the Eldergleam Sanctuary in Frostwater Tundra, to pray at the base of the tree. It produces a unique type of Amber, one that gives a faint, albeit soothing melody. The bark of the Eldergleam is older than metal, making it hopeless to leave so much as a scratch on the tree. Only the magic of the &lt;a href=\"Nettlebane\"&gt;Nettlebane&lt;/a&gt; can cut it. Should the tree be disturbed, the dormant &lt;a href=\"Spriggan\"&gt;Spriggan&lt;/a&gt;s living in the Sanctuary will become hostile.\nGovernment.\nLike the rest of Skyrim, the Nords of Eastmarch are led by a &lt;a href=\"Jarl\"&gt;Jarl&lt;/a&gt;, who operate in a Longhouse, in this case, the &lt;a href=\"Palace%20of%20the%20Kings\"&gt;Palace of the Kings&lt;/a&gt;, which was built by Ysgramor in the Merethic Era. Like other rulers, a Jarl is chosen by next of kin, the eldest son/daughter assumes the position. Jarls can give certain people the title of &lt;a href=\"Thane%20%28Title%29\"&gt;Thane&lt;/a&gt;, for people of the utmost importance. This ranges from people who help the Jarl's Court personally or a hero of that domain. Thanes can be gifted smaller settlements, to which they rule from. But Windhelm's political history is much larger than that. Ever since Ysgramor's creation of Windhelm, the city-state has been the capital of the province, as the &lt;a href=\"Nordic%20Empire\"&gt;Nordic Empire&lt;/a&gt; expanded into the rest of the modern-day province. By the reign of &lt;a href=\"Harald\"&gt;Harald&lt;/a&gt;, the thirteenth of the &lt;a href=\"Ysgramor%20Dynasty\"&gt;Ysgramor Dynasty&lt;/a&gt;, Windhelm became the capital of Skyrim, as all holdings on &lt;a href=\"Atmora\"&gt;Atmora&lt;/a&gt; were relinquished. But when the capital was moved to &lt;a href=\"Winterhold%20%28City%29\"&gt;Winterhold&lt;/a&gt;, Windhelm started to have Jarls as leaders, rather than the &lt;a href=\"High%20King\"&gt;High King&lt;/a&gt;. It has remained this way ever since.\nIn recent years, the Jarl of Windhelm, &lt;a href=\"Ulfric%20Stormcloak\"&gt;Ulfric Stormcloak&lt;/a&gt; had rebelled against the &lt;a href=\"Imperial%20Legion\"&gt;Imperial Legion&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Third%20Empire\"&gt;Third Empire&lt;/a&gt;, due to the terms issued by the &lt;a href=\"White-Gold%20Concordat\"&gt;White-Gold Concordat&lt;/a&gt;. The &lt;a href=\"Stormcloaks\"&gt;Stormcloaks&lt;/a&gt; is a rebellious group that values Nordic nationalism and pride, believing to be betrayed by the Empire, for they were forced to ban the worship of &lt;a href=\"Talos\"&gt;Talos&lt;/a&gt;. Ulfric has gathered cities of the Old Holds under his banner, as well as, various Nords that take pride in their heritage. Ulfric hails from the &lt;a href=\"Stormcloak%20Clan\"&gt;Stormcloak Clan&lt;/a&gt;, an ancient family of Nords that date back all the while into the &lt;a href=\"First%20Era\"&gt;First Era&lt;/a&gt;. When Windhelm was ruled by &lt;a href=\"Jorunn%20the%20Skald-King\"&gt;Jorunn the Skald-King&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Mera%20Stormcloak\"&gt;Mera Stormcloak&lt;/a&gt; was the Thane of Windhelm, as well as, a member of his entourage. In the mid &lt;a href=\"Second%20Era\"&gt;Second Era&lt;/a&gt;, the province of Skyrim had split into the east and west, with Windhelm as the East capital. Jorunn the Skald-King ruled over Eastern Skyrim during this schism, out of Windhelm. But eventually, the provinces reunited, sometime before the rise of &lt;a href=\"Tiber%20Septim\"&gt;Tiber Septim&lt;/a&gt;. But beyond that, Eastmarch largely rural, with any settlement operating out from Windhelm being overseen by the officials in the north. The only exception is the &lt;a href=\"Orsimer\"&gt;Orsimer&lt;/a&gt;, who have occasionally occupied secluded areas in Eastmarch, such as the once formidable, &lt;a href=\"Cradlecrush\"&gt;Cradlecrush&lt;/a&gt;, and the mining clanhold of &lt;a href=\"Narzulbur\"&gt;Narzulbur&lt;/a&gt;. In there, the Orcs follow the &lt;a href=\"Code%20of%20Malacath\"&gt;Code of Malacath&lt;/a&gt;.\nReligion.\nThe residents of the Empires of Cyrodiil have taken to worship the &lt;a href=\"Nine%20Divines\"&gt;Nine Divines&lt;/a&gt;, an accumulation of the various deities and pantheons of Tamriel, to centralize the continent, and Skyrim was no exception. Because of the god's roots in Skyrim's history and mythos, &lt;a href=\"Talos\"&gt;Talos&lt;/a&gt; has been worshipped in Windhelm, capital of Eastmarch. Talos is the God of War, as well as, the Hero-God of Mankind. He is known by his mortal form, &lt;a href=\"Tiber%20Septim\"&gt;Tiber Septim&lt;/a&gt;, who conquered all nine provinces amidst the &lt;a href=\"Interregnum\"&gt;Interregnum&lt;/a&gt;, establishing both the &lt;a href=\"Third%20Empire\"&gt;Third Empire&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Third%20Era\"&gt;Third Era&lt;/a&gt;. Talos is also known as, &lt;a href=\"Ysmir\"&gt;Ysmir&lt;/a&gt;, a title granted to the &lt;a href=\"Dragonborn%20%28Lore%29\"&gt;Dragonborn&lt;/a&gt;, who are those of Dragon's Blood. Windhelm has the &lt;a href=\"Temple%20of%20Talos\"&gt;Temple of Talos&lt;/a&gt; within the Stone Quarter of the city. But with the banned worship of Talos in the Empire, followers of the deity had dwindled, but the Temple had remained an often traveled to site, thirty-years after the signing of the White-Gold Concordat. Worship of Talos was not as widespread as the other Eight Divines, for the only other known temple was in the city-state of &lt;a href=\"Bruma\"&gt;Bruma&lt;/a&gt;.\nBut before the creation of the Divines, the Nords of Skyrim celebrated the &lt;a href=\"Nordic%20Pantheon\"&gt;Nordic Pantheon&lt;/a&gt;, who have shaped the history of the Nordic people since their escape from Atmora. The head of the pantheon is &lt;a href=\"Shor\"&gt;Shor&lt;/a&gt;, the Nordic aspect of &lt;a href=\"Lorkhan\"&gt;Lorkhan&lt;/a&gt;. Shor had taken the side of &lt;a href=\"Man\"&gt;Man&lt;/a&gt; after the creation of &lt;a href=\"Mundus\"&gt;Mundus&lt;/a&gt;, leading them to battle against the &lt;a href=\"Aldmeri\"&gt;Aldmeri&lt;/a&gt;. Eventually, he was stricken down by the &lt;a href=\"Aldmeri%20Pantheon\"&gt;Aldmeri Pantheon&lt;/a&gt;, sent to the underworld as a result. It is commonly believed, that Shor sits at the &lt;a href=\"Hall%20of%20Valor\"&gt;Hall of Valor&lt;/a&gt;, within the Nordic afterlife of &lt;a href=\"Sovngarde%20%28Location%29\"&gt;Sovngarde&lt;/a&gt;. Here, the greatest warriors in Nordic history sit at the long table, for endless battle and eternal hearth. Legends such as Ysgramor, &lt;a href=\"Felldir%20the%20Old\"&gt;Felldir the Old&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Jurgen%20Windcaller\"&gt;Jurgen Windcaller&lt;/a&gt; live in the Hall of Valor until the end of time. Shor's wife, &lt;a href=\"Kyne\"&gt;Kyne&lt;/a&gt; is the Goddess of Storms, who guided the Atmorans across the Sea of Ghosts and to colonize the lands of Mereth, modern-day Skyrim. The Nords refer to themselves as \"Son's and Daughter's of Kyne,\" for she has protected for many years. But, even before the gods of Shor and Sovngarde, the Ancient Nords had followed the &lt;a href=\"Ancient%20Nordic%20Pantheon\"&gt;Ancient Nordic Pantheon&lt;/a&gt;, a much early rendition of the Nordic Pantheon, where the animals of nature represent the Gods. Shor is represented as the &lt;a href=\"Fox\"&gt;Fox&lt;/a&gt;, as one of the Dead Gods. Kyne is represented by the &lt;a href=\"Hawk\"&gt;Hawk&lt;/a&gt;. The religion is visually represented through totems. The &lt;a href=\"Ternion%20Monks\"&gt;Ternion Monks&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"Mistwatch\"&gt;Mistwatch&lt;/a&gt; was one of the few remaining followers of this ancient order, living in seclusion in the mountains of &lt;a href=\"Ysgramor%27s%20Teeth\"&gt;Ysgramor's Teeth&lt;/a&gt;. Specifically, the Ternion Monks worship the &lt;a href=\"Bear\"&gt;Bear&lt;/a&gt;, the Wolf, and the Fox, collectively known as the Three Old Gods, or more specifically, &lt;a href=\"Tsun\"&gt;Tsun&lt;/a&gt;, Kyne, and Shor.\nHistory.\n&lt;a href=\"Merethic%20Era\"&gt;Merethic Era&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe Five Hundred Companions &amp; the Night of Separation.\nAfter the &lt;a href=\"Night%20of%20Tears\"&gt;Night of Tears&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"Atmorans\"&gt;Atmorans&lt;/a&gt; had fled back to &lt;a href=\"Atmora\"&gt;Atmora&lt;/a&gt;, to build up an army to purge the &lt;a href=\"Snow%20Elves\"&gt;Snow Elves&lt;/a&gt; for their treachery. The two children of &lt;a href=\"Ysgramor\"&gt;Ysgramor&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Yngol\"&gt;Yngol&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Ylgar\"&gt;Ylgar&lt;/a&gt; had established the &lt;a href=\"Five%20Hundred%20Companions\"&gt;Five Hundred Companions&lt;/a&gt;, commissioning the ships, the &lt;a href=\"Harakk\"&gt;Harakk&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Darumzu\"&gt;Darumzu&lt;/a&gt; to be built for their voyage back to &lt;a href=\"Mereth\"&gt;Mereth&lt;/a&gt;. On the &lt;a href=\"Day%20of%20Final%20Passage\"&gt;Day of Final Passage&lt;/a&gt;, Ysgramor gathered the Five Hundred Companions and sailed across the &lt;a href=\"Sea%20of%20Ghosts\"&gt;Sea of Ghosts&lt;/a&gt; but things would take a turn for the worst. The &lt;a href=\"Storm%20of%20Separation\"&gt;Storm of Separation&lt;/a&gt; had led to the fleet to split off of each other, which resulted in the demise of Yngol. Both Ysgramor and Ylgar arrived back to Mereth, only to find that Yngol had died out in the sea and the Wreck of the Harakk arrived on shore. The Five Hundred Companions had last their first group, the Harakk and Ylgar honored their names with &lt;a href=\"the%20Companions\"&gt;the Companions&lt;/a&gt;. Ysgramor had slain dozens of beasts and burned them in honor of Yngol and his fallen comrades. &lt;a href=\"Yngol%20Barrow\"&gt;Yngol Barrow&lt;/a&gt; was crafted in the traditional Atmoran style, with rites dedicated to his son. The Five Hundred Companions had landed onto &lt;a href=\"Hsaarik%20Head\"&gt;Hsaarik Head&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Winterhold%20%28Region%29\"&gt;Winterhold&lt;/a&gt;, eventually spreading towards the &lt;a href=\"Old%20Holds\"&gt;Old Holds&lt;/a&gt; and into modern-day Eastmarch where Yngol Barrow is situated.\nThe City of Kings &amp; the Reign of Ysgramor.\nYsgramor, grief-stricken by his son's death, had set his eyes on a plot of land along the Yorgrim River, where Ysgramor declared that a city would be built there, a city built by Ysgramor and the crew of the &lt;a href=\"Ylgermet\"&gt;Ylgermet&lt;/a&gt; to honor the achievements and glories of mankind. Ysgramor wanted to construct a palace that had a view of Yngol Barrow; this would become the &lt;a href=\"Palace%20of%20the%20Kings\"&gt;Palace of the Kings&lt;/a&gt;. Many elven slaves were put to work on the City of Kings, with many of them dying in the process. As time went on, the great stone bridge across the Yorgrim was built. The city was built so that it was seen from across the land, and so those coming towards the settlement must show respect to the claimants of the region. Deep beneath the City of Kings, there was an ancient tomb dedicated to Ysgramor, when he would be called to &lt;a href=\"Sovngarde%20%28Location%29\"&gt;Sovngarde&lt;/a&gt; on that fateful day. Though instead, he opted to be buried in a &lt;a href=\"Ysgramor%27s%20Tomb\"&gt;secluded tomb&lt;/a&gt; that looks towards the frozen plains of Atmora, his original home. The city that Ysgramor created from the ground up was &lt;a href=\"Windhelm\"&gt;Windhelm&lt;/a&gt;, which became the capital of the &lt;a href=\"Nordic%20Empire\"&gt;Nordic Empire&lt;/a&gt;. As time went on, Ysgramor had passed away and ventured forward to Sovngarde, leaving the throne to his son, &lt;a href=\"Ylgar\"&gt;Ylgar&lt;/a&gt;, eventually going down as the &lt;a href=\"Ysgramor%20Dynasty\"&gt;Ysgramor Dynasty&lt;/a&gt;, ruling out of Windhelm.\nThe Direfrost Clan; Witch Hunters of the March.\nFrom the city-state of Windhelm, the various clans of Eastmarch had spread, claiming land and influencing the growth of the Empire. From the &lt;a href=\"Cruel-Sea%20Clan\"&gt;Cruel-Sea Clan&lt;/a&gt;, that confronts the brutal waves of the Ghost Sea, to the &lt;a href=\"Stormcloak%20Clan\"&gt;Stormcloak Clan&lt;/a&gt;, who honor and uphold the ancient traditions of Skyrim and the Nords. But none more well-known and fearsome than the &lt;a href=\"Direfrost%20Clan\"&gt;Direfrost Clan&lt;/a&gt;. The Direfrost Clan are welcoming and gentle people but have little to no tolerance to the practices of &lt;a href=\"Witchcraft\"&gt;Witchcraft&lt;/a&gt;, which is prevalent in the forests of the Old Holds. The earliest known Direfrost was &lt;a href=\"Hroldin%20Direfrost\"&gt;Hroldin Direfrost&lt;/a&gt;, who reigned over Northern Eastmarch and controlled the villages surrounding his domain. The Direfrost are talented witch-hunters that have fought even the vilest witches in the land. As time went on, the Direfrost retreated to the Southern Velothi where they established &lt;a href=\"Direfrost%20Keep\"&gt;Direfrost Keep&lt;/a&gt;. Deep in the castle, the Direfrost Family protects the &lt;a href=\"Direfrost%20Flame\"&gt;Direfrost Flame&lt;/a&gt;, a flame that connects the Direfrost of the living, to the Direfrost in Sovngarde. It can only be lit with the &lt;a href=\"Torch%20of%20Heirs\"&gt;Torch of Heirs&lt;/a&gt;. But eventually, the Direfrost had spread across Skyrim, and the flame went out. From then on, Direfrost Keep was abandoned, waiting for the next Direfrost to light the flame and reclaim their birthright from the witches of Eastmarch.\n&lt;a href=\"First%20Era\"&gt;First Era&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe Rise of King Harald &amp; the Province of Skyrim.\nAs time went on, the Ysgramor Dynasty ruled the First Empire of the Nords, from Ysgramor to Ylgar, and a sudden takeover of the &lt;a href=\"Dragon%20Cult\"&gt;Dragon Cult&lt;/a&gt;. The High Kings would focus on Skyrim, as Atmora was slowly slipping away from their grips. The Atmorans, and the &lt;a href=\"Nedes\"&gt;Nedes&lt;/a&gt; would spread all throughout Skyrim, even land beyond the mountains. But things would change with the reign of &lt;a href=\"King%20Harald\"&gt;King Harald&lt;/a&gt;, the thirteenth heir of the Ysgramor line. By &lt;a href=\"1E%20113\"&gt;1E 113&lt;/a&gt;, Harald Hand-Free had relinquished all holdings on Atmora, thus making separating the &lt;a href=\"Nords\"&gt;Nords&lt;/a&gt; of Skyrim from their lost homeland, paving the way for their destiny. Harald had established the Province of Skyrim, continuing the Ysgramor line with his eldest son, &lt;a href=\"Hjalmer\"&gt;Hjalmer&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"1E%20221\"&gt;1E 221&lt;/a&gt;, who would later die a year later, passing it to his younger brother, &lt;a href=\"Vrage%20the%20Gifted\"&gt;Vrage the Gifted&lt;/a&gt;. Vrage would further expand the Empire, in a joint event known as the &lt;a href=\"Skyrim%20Conquests\"&gt;Skyrim Conquests&lt;/a&gt;. Vrage's Empire expanded beyond the traditional borders, taking control of &lt;a href=\"High%20Rock\"&gt;High Rock&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"Nibenay\"&gt;Nibenay&lt;/a&gt;, and mainland &lt;a href=\"Morrowind\"&gt;Morrowind&lt;/a&gt;. Cities such as &lt;a href=\"Daggerfall\"&gt;Daggerfall&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Ebonheart\"&gt;Ebonheart&lt;/a&gt; were under the control of the Nords. This would last for roughly two-hundred years, as the Ysgramor Dynasty ruled over Skyrim.\nThe Kragen Clan's Expansion &amp; the Story of Aetherium.\nIn &lt;a href=\"1E%20420\"&gt;1E 420&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"Dwarves\"&gt;Dwarves&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"Vvardenfell\"&gt;Vvardenfell&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Chimer\"&gt;Chimer&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"Resdayn\"&gt;Resdayn&lt;/a&gt; formed an alliance which became known as the &lt;a href=\"First%20Council\"&gt;First Council&lt;/a&gt; when they repelled the Skyrim occupation of Morrowind with the &lt;a href=\"Battle%20of%20Red%20Mountain\"&gt;Battle of Red Mountain&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"1E%20416\"&gt;1E 416&lt;/a&gt;. With the formation of the First Council, many Dwarven clans left Morrowind to establish their own civilization, one such group was the &lt;a href=\"Kragen%20Clan\"&gt;Kragen Clan&lt;/a&gt;, who arrived in the mountains of &lt;a href=\"the%20Reach\"&gt;the Reach&lt;/a&gt; and built their capital of &lt;a href=\"Arkngthamz\"&gt;Arkngthamz&lt;/a&gt;, where they discovered a powerful material called &lt;a href=\"Aetherium\"&gt;Aetherium&lt;/a&gt;. With this discovery, Arkngthamz prospered, and many more cities were built following the Kragen's departure to the Reach. Eventually, Arkngthamz became a great research center for Aetherium, establishing a loose alliance of four kingdoms, one of which was &lt;a href=\"Mzulft\"&gt;Mzulft&lt;/a&gt; in Lower Eastmarch. The city-state of Mzulft was forced to use a warehouse to keep their Aetherium because it was apparently, \"harmonically violating.\" As time went on, the loose alliance waged war with each other over complete control of the Aetherium. This event was known as the &lt;a href=\"Aetherium%20Wars\"&gt;Aetherium Wars&lt;/a&gt;, which raged across Skyrim. The Dwarves of Mzulft were driven out of their home with the intervention of &lt;a href=\"King%20Gellir\"&gt;King Gellir&lt;/a&gt;. As time went on, the people retook their home, but like the rest of their race, the Dwemer of Mzulft disappeared, and their large portions of Aetherium laid hidden ever since.\n&lt;a href=\"Second%20Era\"&gt;Second Era&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe War of Separation &amp; Queen Freydis of East Skyrim.\nAmidst the reign of the &lt;a href=\"Alessian%20Empire\"&gt;Alessian Empire&lt;/a&gt;, the province of Skyrim was ruled by &lt;a href=\"King%20Borgas\"&gt;King Borgas&lt;/a&gt;. At this point, the capital had been changed to the city-state of &lt;a href=\"Winterhold%20%28City%29\"&gt;Winterhold&lt;/a&gt;, which remained as capital for many more years than Windhelm. Borgas was a staunch supporter of the &lt;a href=\"Alessian%20Order\"&gt;Alessian Order&lt;/a&gt;, a faith founded by the prophet, &lt;a href=\"Marukh\"&gt;Marukh&lt;/a&gt;. When Borgas learned of &lt;a href=\"Valenwood\"&gt;Valenwood&lt;/a&gt;'s denial of the Order, Borgas called for a joint invasion with the Alessians to invade the province and enforce the will of the Alessians. High King Borgas was killed by the &lt;a href=\"Wood%20Elves\"&gt;Wood Elves&lt;/a&gt; in an event known as the &lt;a href=\"Wild%20Hunt\"&gt;Wild Hunt&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"1E%20369\"&gt;1E 369&lt;/a&gt;. Borgas was the last of the Ysgramor Dynasty, and because of internal conflict regarding the next ruler, the &lt;a href=\"War%20of%20Succession\"&gt;War of Succession&lt;/a&gt; had commenced, lasting until &lt;a href=\"1E%20420\"&gt;1E 420&lt;/a&gt;. At that point, territory from Morrowind to High Rock was lost to their respective people. Amidst the conflict, Windhelm was sacked. 1E 420, the Jarls of Skyrim created the &lt;a href=\"Pact%20of%20Chieftains\"&gt;Pact of Chieftains&lt;/a&gt;, which proclaimed that when a leader dies without heirs, a moot is called to issue a new dynasty. &lt;a href=\"Olaf%20One-Eye\"&gt;Olaf One-Eye&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"Whiterun\"&gt;Whiterun&lt;/a&gt; ended the conflict and became &lt;a href=\"High%20King\"&gt;High King&lt;/a&gt;. The &lt;a href=\"Jagged%20Crown\"&gt;Jagged Crown&lt;/a&gt;, that the Ysgramor Dynasty has worn for many years, had disappeared along with Borgas in the ruins of &lt;a href=\"Korvanjund\"&gt;Korvanjund&lt;/a&gt;.\nOlaf One-Eye had reigned over Skyrim with internal strife and division, dying without an heir as well, to better choose a new ruler, the Jarls of Skyrim had commissioned the creation of the &lt;a href=\"Crown%20of%20Verity\"&gt;Crown of Verity&lt;/a&gt;, a magical crown that dictates the proper ruler for Skyrim. The Crown was first used after Olaf's death. &lt;a href=\"Asurn%20Ice-Breaker\"&gt;Asurn Ice-Breaker&lt;/a&gt; was chosen by the &lt;a href=\"Moot\"&gt;Moot&lt;/a&gt; to rule over Skyrim, but the Crown did not select him. When he threatened the moot, he was stricken down by the future High King, &lt;a href=\"Kjoric%20the%20White\"&gt;Kjoric the White&lt;/a&gt;. The Crown had chosen Kjoric to rule over Skyrim. As time went on, the Crown had been used to issue rulers throughout Skyrim, and no one had questioned it until the mid-Second Era with the death of &lt;a href=\"High%20King%20Logrolf\"&gt;High King Logrolf&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"2E%20431\"&gt;2E 431&lt;/a&gt;. The Crown had chosen his daughter, &lt;a href=\"Freydis\"&gt;Freydis&lt;/a&gt; of Windhelm to rule the province although, the Moot had chosen &lt;a href=\"Svartr\"&gt;Svartr&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"Solitude\"&gt;Solitude&lt;/a&gt;. Because of this, a schism had split the provinces between the &lt;a href=\"West%20Kingdom\"&gt;West Kingdom&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Eastern%20Kingdom\"&gt;Eastern Kingdom&lt;/a&gt;. Freydis became the High Queen of Eastern Skyrim while Svartr became the High King of Western Skyrim. From then on, Skyrim was split for many years, and as time went on, Freydis' lineage continued to rule over Skyrim. Her daughter, &lt;a href=\"Mabjaarn%20Flame-Hair\"&gt;Mabjaarn Flame-Hair&lt;/a&gt; would rule after her mother's time. The city-states of Windhelm, Winterhold, &lt;a href=\"Dawnstar\"&gt;Dawnstar&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Riften\"&gt;Riften&lt;/a&gt; were a part of the Eastern Kingdom of Skyrim.\nThe Second Akaviri Invasion &amp; the Brothers' War.\nIn &lt;a href=\"2E%20572\"&gt;2E 572&lt;/a&gt;, the northeast of Tamriel was invaded by the &lt;a href=\"Akaviri\"&gt;Akaviri&lt;/a&gt;, specifically the &lt;a href=\"Snow%20Demons%20of%20Kamal\"&gt;Snow Demons of Kamal&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href=\"Ada%27Soom%20Dir-Kamal\"&gt;Ada'Soom Dir-Kamal&lt;/a&gt;'s fleet across the northeast coast, bypassing the &lt;a href=\"Telvanni%20Peninsula\"&gt;Telvanni Peninsula&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Solstheim\"&gt;Solstheim&lt;/a&gt;, eventually landing on the shores of Eastmarch, beginning their attack with the &lt;a href=\"Sack%20of%20Windhelm\"&gt;Sack of Windhelm&lt;/a&gt;. At this point, the city-state of Windhelm was ruled by Mabjaarn Flame-Hair. The defense against the invasion was led by High Queen Mabjaarn and her eldest daughter, &lt;a href=\"Nurnhilde\"&gt;Nurnhilde&lt;/a&gt;. At this point, both Princes, &lt;a href=\"Jorunn%20the%20Skald-Prince\"&gt;Jorunn the Skald-Prince&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Fildgor%20Strong-Prince\"&gt;Fildgor Strong-Prince&lt;/a&gt; were away, with the former in &lt;a href=\"the%20Rift\"&gt;the Rift&lt;/a&gt; and the latter in &lt;a href=\"Whiterun%20Hold\"&gt;Whiterun Hold&lt;/a&gt;. Amidst the destruction of the &lt;a href=\"Palace%20of%20the%20Kings\"&gt;Palace of the Kings&lt;/a&gt;, Mabjaarn was killed, with Nurnhilde temporarily assuming the throne. Fildgor joined the fray with the &lt;a href=\"Stormfist%20Clan\"&gt;Stormfist Clan&lt;/a&gt;, which hails from Whiterun. Both princes arrived in Windhelm as the gates were broken, and the two pushed back the Akaviri. With the Kamali gone, a new leader was needed to rule over the Kingdom. Fildgor stepped forth to claim leadership, expecting Jorunn to allow this to transpire. But the Skald-Prince knew better, seeing his brother in action has made him felt that Fildgor is not befitted to rule Eastern Skyrim. Jorunn objected, and when the Stormfist rallied with Fildgor, Jorunn saw civil war in the midst and challenged Strong-Prince to a &lt;a href=\"Traditional%20Nordic%20Duel\"&gt;Traditional Nordic Duel&lt;/a&gt;. In the end, Fildgor was defeated and Jorunn assumed the throne of Eastern Skyrim. But the conflict was not over, and so the newly-proclaimed, Skald-King took to &lt;a href=\"High%20Hrothgar\"&gt;High Hrothgar&lt;/a&gt;, to seek further help from &lt;a href=\"the%20Greybeards\"&gt;the Greybeards&lt;/a&gt;. Fildgor was exiled, seeking refuge in &lt;a href=\"West%20Skyrim\"&gt;West Skyrim&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe Battle of Stonefalls &amp; the Ebonheart Pact.\nJorunn the Skald-King had trekked the seven-thousand steps and reached the monastery of &lt;a href=\"High%20Hrothgar\"&gt;High Hrothgar&lt;/a&gt;, seeking help from the Greybeards. The monks denied him, but instead, the Greybeards had summoned &lt;a href=\"Wulfharth\"&gt;Wulfharth&lt;/a&gt;, the Ash-King, to aid Jorunn in the &lt;a href=\"Second%20Akaviri%20Invasion\"&gt;Second Akaviri Invasion&lt;/a&gt;. At this point, the Kamali moved south to the Rift, bypassing the bulwark at &lt;a href=\"Fort%20Greenwall\"&gt;Fort Greenwall&lt;/a&gt;. With the Ash King, Jorunn traveled to &lt;a href=\"Riften\"&gt;Riften&lt;/a&gt;, where the Nordic warriors were inspired by Wulfharth's return, bearing arms and preparing to attack the Kamali. When the &lt;a href=\"Akaviri\"&gt;Akaviri&lt;/a&gt; reached Riften, they saw a large army of angry Nords, and so they decided to ignore them and enter the &lt;a href=\"Stonefalls\"&gt;Stonefalls&lt;/a&gt; region. The armies of Eastern Skyrim had followed the Akaviri Army into the area known as &lt;a href=\"Vivec%27s%20Antlers\"&gt;Vivec's Antlers&lt;/a&gt;, where the &lt;a href=\"Dark%20Elves\"&gt;Dark Elves&lt;/a&gt; under &lt;a href=\"Almalexia\"&gt;Almalexia&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Tanval%20Indoril\"&gt;Tanval Indoril&lt;/a&gt; were facing a gruesome battle. When the Nords arrived, the battle was at a standstill, with no signs of progress on both sides. It was not until the intervention of &lt;a href=\"Argonians\"&gt;Argonians&lt;/a&gt; under the command of &lt;a href=\"Heita-Meen\"&gt;Heita-Meen&lt;/a&gt;, that the Akaviri were ultimately defeated and the Invasion was over. In case of another invasion as extreme as this, the three factions banded together and formed the &lt;a href=\"Ebonheart%20Pact\"&gt;Ebonheart Pact&lt;/a&gt;. This consisted of the Nords of East Skyrim, the Dark Elves (except the &lt;a href=\"Telvanni\"&gt;Telvanni&lt;/a&gt;) of Morrowind, and the Argonians of the border Black Marsh.\nJorunn's Konunleikar &amp; the Return of Fildgor.\nDuring the &lt;a href=\"Interregnum\"&gt;Interregnum&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"2E%20582\"&gt;2E 582&lt;/a&gt;, the city-state of Windhelm celebrated the &lt;a href=\"Konunleikar\"&gt;Konunleikar&lt;/a&gt; of Jorunn the Skald-King. A Konunleikar is the tenth year anniversary of a High King of Skyrim, and so the people at the capital celebrate and revel all day. &lt;a href=\"Mera%20Stormcloak\"&gt;Mera Stormcloak&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"Thane%20%28Title%29\"&gt;Thane&lt;/a&gt; of Windhelm, had hosted the Konunleikar in the city, overlooking everything from the drinking contest, to the Footrace of the Nine Holds. Delegates of the Pact, such as &lt;a href=\"General%20Yeveth%20Noramil\"&gt;General Yeveth Noramil&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Eyes-of-Steel\"&gt;Eyes-of-Steel&lt;/a&gt;, both leaders of their race in the &lt;a href=\"Great%20Moot\"&gt;Great Moot&lt;/a&gt;, arrived to enjoy the Konunleikar. But Thane Mera would undergo stress with the sudden arrival of the Stormfist Brigade, the same clan that is loyal to Fildgor Strong-Prince, amidst the Second Akaviri Invasion. Thane Mera had tasked an &lt;a href=\"Vestige\"&gt;Agent&lt;/a&gt; of the Pact with investigating their arrival and going undercover throughout the Konunleikar celebration. It was revealed that the Stormfist had sabotaged the Footrace of the Nine Holds, by injuring a racer, &lt;a href=\"Hadring%20the%20Swift\"&gt;Hadring the Swift&lt;/a&gt;. When news came of an assassination attempt, the Agent was rushed to the &lt;a href=\"Hall%20of%20Trials\"&gt;Hall of Trials&lt;/a&gt;, where &lt;a href=\"Leimaer%20the%20Raven\"&gt;Leimaer the Raven&lt;/a&gt; had won the competition. Before she could assassinate the Skald-King, the Agent intervened, and Stormfist warriors had entered the fray. In the end, Leimaer was killed, and the city was on high-alert. Fildgor had made his move, seeking out the body of his sister, &lt;a href=\"Nurnhilde\"&gt;Nurnhilde&lt;/a&gt; at the royal crypts of &lt;a href=\"Morvunskar\"&gt;Morvunskar&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe War Council at Fort Amol; Plot against the King.\nAmidst the Konunleikar, the delegates of the Pact decided to gather at the stronghold town of &lt;a href=\"Fort%20Amol\"&gt;Fort Amol&lt;/a&gt;, with the intent to properly establish the Ebonheart Pact with offerings to the &lt;a href=\"Great%20Moot\"&gt;Great Moot&lt;/a&gt;. At this point in time, the Stormfist Brigade had raided the royal tombs at Morvunskar, and Fildgor Orcthane had taken the &lt;a href=\"Crown%20of%20Freydis\"&gt;Crown of Freydis&lt;/a&gt; and the remains of Queen Nurnhilde. The Pact Delegates were unaware of the threat, and what made matters worse, is the disrespect that &lt;a href=\"Prince%20Irnskar\"&gt;Prince Irnskar&lt;/a&gt; had issued to the delegates. The Agent of the Pact needed to convince the delegates to continue the Moot and to warn them of the threat. All the while, a &lt;a href=\"Morag%20Tong\"&gt;Morag Tong&lt;/a&gt; agent, &lt;a href=\"Naryu%20Virian\"&gt;Naryu Virian&lt;/a&gt; came to Fort Amol to kill an alchemist that deals with Daedric Magic. Jorunn retired in &lt;a href=\"Jarl%20Ivannar\"&gt;Jarl Ivannar&lt;/a&gt;'s Keep in Amol, awaiting the meeting. However, it was revealed that &lt;a href=\"Lord%20Vurlop\"&gt;Lord Vurlop&lt;/a&gt; of Jorunn's entourage had poisoned him, with a concoction from &lt;a href=\"Dhalen\"&gt;Dhalen&lt;/a&gt;, Virian's target. Both the Agent and Virian entered the Keep, killing the alchemist, and Lord Vurlop. With both agents of the Stormfist dead, Jorunn was heavily afflicted by the poison, nothing that the Pact Healers were able to cure. When the Argonians and Dunmer treated the King, Prince Irnskar's opinion changed, accepting them as his allies. With no other choice, Jorunn the Skald-King needed to seek aid from a Dreamwalker and the Ternion Monks of Mistwatch.\nEnter the Dreamstride; the Ternion Monks of Mistwatch.\n&lt;a href=\"Thane%20Oda%20Wolf-Sister\"&gt;Thane Oda Wolf-Sister&lt;/a&gt; suggested the Ternion Monks of Mistwatch, and the &lt;a href=\"Dreamwalker\"&gt;Dreamwalker&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Stormy-Eyes\"&gt;Stormy-Eyes&lt;/a&gt; was needed to help Jorunn through his ailment. Dreamwalkers are worshippers of &lt;a href=\"Vaermina\"&gt;Vaermina&lt;/a&gt; that can travel across the &lt;a href=\"Dreamstride\"&gt;Dreamstride&lt;/a&gt;, in exchange for their souls. The Daedric Poison in Jorunn's veins was too strong for the Ternion Monks to completely cure him. The Agent of the Pact had gathered the blood of &lt;a href=\"Vampire\"&gt;Vampire&lt;/a&gt; from &lt;a href=\"Wittestadr\"&gt;Wittestadr&lt;/a&gt;, and forced the &lt;a href=\"Troll\"&gt;Troll&lt;/a&gt;s out of &lt;a href=\"Darkwater%20Crossing\"&gt;Darkwater Crossing&lt;/a&gt;, which Stormy-Eyes needed before committing to the ritual. With everything in motion, the Pact traveled to Mistwatch, with &lt;a href=\"High%20Priest%20Esling\"&gt;High Priest Esling&lt;/a&gt; tending to the Skald-King. Stormy-Eyes begins the ritual and enters the Dreamstride where he and the Agent, face the demons that haunt the King's mind. With all of them defeated, Jorunn's poison was manifesting on the physical plane. The &lt;a href=\"Dream%20Eater\"&gt;Dream Eater&lt;/a&gt; was slowly killing Jorunn, prompting someone to enter and deal with the spirit. All the while, Nurnhilde appears before Jorunn in the dream, warning him of Fildgor's plan in &lt;a href=\"Skuldafn\"&gt;Skuldafn&lt;/a&gt;. With the Dream Eater gone, Jorunn was saved and have now planned a siege for Skuldafn, as the Stormfist Brigade trailed the &lt;a href=\"Velothi%20Mountains\"&gt;Velothi Mountains&lt;/a&gt;.\nAssault on Skuldafn &amp; Fildgor's Gambit to Sovngarde.\nFildgor Orcthane and the Stormfist Brigade scaled the Velothi Mountains and defiled the ancient temple of Skuldafn. The Ebonheart Pact established the redoubt, &lt;a href=\"Jorunn%27s%20Stand\"&gt;Jorunn's Stand&lt;/a&gt; at the base of the mountain, as a sect of the Stormfist under the command of &lt;a href=\"Hald%20Bitterblade\"&gt;Hald Bitterblade&lt;/a&gt; upheld the entrance to the ruins. The battle between the Pact and the Brigade at the footholds ended with the death of Bitterblade. Through a hidden mound, the Pact entered Skuldafn, as the Stormfist established their hold throughout the Skuldafn. Fildgor had taken the body of Nurnhilde and the Crown of Freydis to the summit, where he prepares to enter &lt;a href=\"Sovngarde%20%28Location%29\"&gt;Sovngarde&lt;/a&gt;. The Orcthane entered Sovngarde, nigh reaching the essence of Nurnhilde so that the Crown would be forced to chose him worthy. After a grueling battle between Fildgor and the &lt;a href=\"Vestige\"&gt;Agent&lt;/a&gt;, the Crown had ultimately denied Fildgor, and he was forced to surrender. His fate is unknown as his victor decided it. But with the Stormfist defeated, the &lt;a href=\"Great%20Moot\"&gt;Great Moot&lt;/a&gt; gathered outside the now-defunct portal to Sovngarde. The Dark Elves, represented by &lt;a href=\"General%20Yeveth%20Noramil\"&gt;General Yeveth Noramil&lt;/a&gt;, offered the &lt;a href=\"Judgment%20of%20Saint%20Veloth\"&gt;Judgment of Saint Veloth&lt;/a&gt;, the same hammer that the Prophet, &lt;a href=\"Veloth\"&gt;Veloth&lt;/a&gt; wielded in his exodus from &lt;a href=\"Summerset%20Isles\"&gt;Altmeris&lt;/a&gt;, when he vowed to build a new home for the &lt;a href=\"Chimer\"&gt;Chimer&lt;/a&gt;i. The Argonians, represented by &lt;a href=\"Eyes-of-Steel\"&gt;Eyes-of-Steel&lt;/a&gt;, offered the &lt;a href=\"Mnemic%20Egg\"&gt;Mnemic Egg&lt;/a&gt;, a symbol of life and birth to the Saxhleel, bringing forth generations of Argonian children. And the Nords, represented by Jorunn the Skald-King, offered the &lt;a href=\"Crown%20of%20Freydis\"&gt;Crown of Freydis&lt;/a&gt;, the ancient crown that dictates the monarch of the Eastern Kingdom for many years, should the modern dynasty die without a successor. With everything set in motion, Jorunn had been proclaimed the High King of the Ebonheart Pact, ruling the alliance until his demise. With the Pact fully-established, peace remained, although, trouble would arise when the &lt;a href=\"Reachmen\"&gt;Reachmen&lt;/a&gt; appeared in &lt;a href=\"the%20Rift\"&gt;the Rift&lt;/a&gt;.\n&lt;a href=\"Third%20Era\"&gt;Third Era&lt;/a&gt;.\nEastmarch during the Imperial Simulacrum.\nDuring the &lt;a href=\"Imperial%20Simulacrum\"&gt;Imperial Simulacrum&lt;/a&gt; from &lt;a href=\"3E%20389\"&gt;3E 389&lt;/a&gt; to &lt;a href=\"3E%20399\"&gt;3E 399&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"Imperial\"&gt;Imperial&lt;/a&gt; Battlemage named &lt;a href=\"Jagar%20Tharn\"&gt;Jagar Tharn&lt;/a&gt; impersonated Emperor &lt;a href=\"Uriel%20Septim%20VII\"&gt;Uriel Septim VII&lt;/a&gt; and casted both him and &lt;a href=\"Talin%20Warhaft\"&gt;Talin Warhaft&lt;/a&gt; into the &lt;a href=\"Deadlands\"&gt;Deadlands&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Mehrunes%20Dagon\"&gt;Mehrunes Dagon&lt;/a&gt;'s plane of &lt;a href=\"Oblivion\"&gt;Oblivion&lt;/a&gt;. Jagar Tharn had a mighty staff called the &lt;a href=\"Staff%20of%20Chaos\"&gt;Staff of Chaos&lt;/a&gt; which was the key to releasing Uriel and Warhaft from the Deadlands. To secure his control, he broke the Staff of Chaos into several pieces and hid them across the provinces in Tamriel. Tharn's apprentice, &lt;a href=\"Ria%20Silmane\"&gt;Ria Silmane&lt;/a&gt; caught wind of this and planned to tell the &lt;a href=\"Elder%20Council\"&gt;Elder Council&lt;/a&gt;, however, Tharn killed her with his vile magic. Ria Silmane's spirit sought the aid of a warrior also kept imprisoned by Tharn. Silmane help the warrior escaped and tasked them with finding the pieces of the Staff of Chaos throughout Tamriel. At one point, this warrior traveled to the city of Windhelm during their quest to gather the pieces. The warrior defeat Jagar Tharn at the &lt;a href=\"Imperial%20Palace\"&gt;Imperial Palace&lt;/a&gt; and freed both Uriel VII and Talin Warhaft, this young warrior was named the &lt;a href=\"Eternal%20Champion\"&gt;Eternal Champion&lt;/a&gt;. The region of Eastmarch was undefined, and many settlements dotted the landscape or at least the general area. Smaller townships such as &lt;a href=\"Pargran%20Village\"&gt;Pargran Village&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Dragon%20Wood\"&gt;Dragon Wood&lt;/a&gt; existed in the area.\n&lt;a href=\"Fourth%20Era\"&gt;Fourth Era&lt;/a&gt;.\nMigration in Skyrim; From Morrowind to Orsinium.\nThe time between the late reign of Uriel Septim VII, to the aftermath of the &lt;a href=\"Oblivion%20Crisis\"&gt;Oblivion Crisis&lt;/a&gt;, has been rough throughout Tamriel, especially in the north in places such as &lt;a href=\"Morrowind\"&gt;Morrowind&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Iliac%20Bay\"&gt;Iliac Bay&lt;/a&gt;, more so the former. The province of Morrowind was hit tragically by the Oblivion Crisis, with the most infamous battle being the &lt;a href=\"Fall%20of%20Ald%27ruhn\"&gt;Fall of Ald'ruhn&lt;/a&gt;, which left the city-state of &lt;a href=\"Ald%27ruhn\"&gt;Ald'ruhn&lt;/a&gt; in ruins by the Daedra. Things would take a turn for the worst in &lt;a href=\"4E%205\"&gt;4E 5&lt;/a&gt;, which is known in history as the &lt;a href=\"Red%20Year\"&gt;Red Year&lt;/a&gt;. On this day, the &lt;a href=\"Ministry%20of%20Truth\"&gt;Ministry of Truth&lt;/a&gt; had crashed onto &lt;a href=\"Vivec%20City\"&gt;Vivec City&lt;/a&gt;, inadvertently causing the eruption of &lt;a href=\"Red%20Mountain\"&gt;Red Mountain&lt;/a&gt;. Not only was the sub-continent of &lt;a href=\"Vvardenfell\"&gt;Vvardenfell&lt;/a&gt; left in complete utter ruin, but the entire province was left weakened and hopeless. Not to mention the rise of the &lt;a href=\"Accession%20War\"&gt;Accession War&lt;/a&gt; in the following year, which resulted in the downfall of &lt;a href=\"House%20Telvanni\"&gt;House Telvanni&lt;/a&gt;. Amidst the utter destruction, the province of Skyrim, especially the &lt;a href=\"Old%20Holds\"&gt;Old Holds&lt;/a&gt; had offered haven to the people. The High King of Skyrim had offered the island territory of &lt;a href=\"Solstheim\"&gt;Solstheim&lt;/a&gt;, which was later claimed by &lt;a href=\"House%20Redoran\"&gt;House Redoran&lt;/a&gt;. In &lt;a href=\"4E%2020\"&gt;4E 20&lt;/a&gt;, Dunmeri refugees from &lt;a href=\"Blacklight\"&gt;Blacklight&lt;/a&gt; moved across the &lt;a href=\"Dunmeth%20Pass\"&gt;Dunmeth Pass&lt;/a&gt; with Windhelm in the horizon. A sight was erected in the area, known as &lt;a href=\"Refugees%27%20Rest\"&gt;Refugees' Rest&lt;/a&gt;. On that day, Skyrim proclaimed that \"untithed to any thane or hold, and self-governed, with free worship, with no compensation to Skyrim or the Empire except as writ in the Armistice of old wheresoever those might still apply, and henceforth let no Man or Mer say that the Sons and Daughters of Kyne are without mercy or honor.\" And from then on, the Dark Elves migrated to Skyrim, taking refuge in Windhelm, &lt;a href=\"Winterhold%20%28City%29\"&gt;Winterhold&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Riften\"&gt;Riften&lt;/a&gt; respectively. In Eastmarch, the Dark Elves settled all throughout Windhelm and the Yorgrim River. Refugees were relocated to the &lt;a href=\"Snow%20Quarter\"&gt;Snow Quarter&lt;/a&gt;, which was colloquially renamed to the \"Gray Quarter\". Many Dunmeri farmers inhabit the outskirts of Windhelm as well.\nBut the Dark Elves were not the only ones to migrate into Skyrim from a ruined land. Sometime in the early fourth era, the &lt;a href=\"Kingdom%20of%20Orsinium\"&gt;Kingdom of Orsinium&lt;/a&gt; was sacked once again by the &lt;a href=\"Bretons\"&gt;Bretons&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Redguards\"&gt;Redguards&lt;/a&gt; of the area. Despite the efforts of the &lt;a href=\"Fifteenth%20Legion\"&gt;Fifteenth Legion&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Seventeenth%20Legion\"&gt;Seventeenth Legion&lt;/a&gt;, the city-state of Orsinium had fallen, one that can be considered one of the more successful iterations. Regardless, the Orcish tribes traveled beyond the &lt;a href=\"Wrothgarian%20Mountains\"&gt;Wrothgarian Mountains&lt;/a&gt; and into the &lt;a href=\"Dragontail%20Mountains\"&gt;Dragontail Mountains&lt;/a&gt; and the mountains of Skyrim. Before any iteration of Orsinium, the Orcs had lived in the Greater Reach and even all of Skyrim for many years. Of these Ancient Orc settlements in Skyrim, the two most well-known is the stronghold of &lt;a href=\"Cradlecrush\"&gt;Cradlecrush&lt;/a&gt;, and the Orcish metropolis of &lt;a href=\"Mor%20Khazgur\"&gt;Mor Khazgur&lt;/a&gt;. In the early fourth era, many settlements were founded in these areas, such as &lt;a href=\"Largashbur\"&gt;Largashbur&lt;/a&gt; in the Rift, &lt;a href=\"Dushnikh%20Yal\"&gt;Dushnikh Yal&lt;/a&gt; in the Reach, and &lt;a href=\"Narzulbur\"&gt;Narzulbur&lt;/a&gt; in Eastmarch. Between the borders of Skyrim and Hammerfell, in the region of &lt;a href=\"Craglorn\"&gt;Craglorn&lt;/a&gt;, the Fourth Orsinium had been founded, remaining for quite some time. While Mor Khazgur returned, albeit less significant, Cradlecrush in Eastmarch did not re-surface, instead, the site was occupied by the &lt;a href=\"Giants\"&gt;Giants&lt;/a&gt; of Frostwater Tundra. Narzulbur is known for their production of &lt;a href=\"Ebony\"&gt;Ebony&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe Skyrim Civil War; Enter Ulfric Stormcloak.\nSeveral years later, in &lt;a href=\"4E%20171\"&gt;4E 171&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"Third%20Empire\"&gt;Third Empire&lt;/a&gt; of Cyrodiil waged war with the &lt;a href=\"Third%20Aldmeri%20Dominion\"&gt;Third Aldmeri Dominion&lt;/a&gt;, in an event known as the &lt;a href=\"Great%20War\"&gt;Great War&lt;/a&gt;. And so, many Nords were called to battle, including &lt;a href=\"Ulfric%20Stormcloak\"&gt;Ulfric Stormcloak&lt;/a&gt;, the heir to Windhelm. At this time, the city-state of Windhelm was ruled by &lt;a href=\"Hoag%20Stormcloak\"&gt;Hoag Stormcloak&lt;/a&gt;, who had accepted both the Dark Elves and the Argonians, both of whom have taken refuge at Windhelm. By while the Argonians were somewhat accepted by the Nords, specifically the &lt;a href=\"Cruel-Sea%20Clan\"&gt;Cruel-Sea Clan&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Shatter-Shield%20Clan\"&gt;Shatter-Shield Clan&lt;/a&gt;, the Dark Elves were not welcome in Windhelm, with many Nords looking at them in disgust. The Gray Quarter was seen as the slums, and a dangerous place to be in. As the Great War occurred, the &lt;a href=\"Imperial%20Legion\"&gt;Imperial Legion&lt;/a&gt; stationed throughout Skyrim went to Cyrodiil to protect the province, thus leading to the &lt;a href=\"Reachmen\"&gt;Reachmen&lt;/a&gt; control of &lt;a href=\"Markarth\"&gt;Markarth&lt;/a&gt;. In response, Ulfric and his militia retook the city and established control over it, until things have blown through. Eventually, Ulfric Stormcloak was imprisoned by the &lt;a href=\"Thalmor\"&gt;Thalmor&lt;/a&gt;, when they arrived into Markarth. As he was in prison, Jarl Hoag died, and Ulfric was forced to deliver a eulogy out of prison. Once he was released, Ulfric Stormcloak became the Jarl of Windhelm. Unlike his father, Jarl Ulfric was in no way tolerant as his father. Because of his imprisonment, Ulfric felt that the Nords of Skyrim must take to arms against the Empire, for betraying them with the banishment of &lt;a href=\"Talos\"&gt;Talos&lt;/a&gt; worship. And so, Ulfric formed the &lt;a href=\"Stormcloaks\"&gt;Stormcloaks&lt;/a&gt;, out of the militia that served him in Markarth. Tension would slowly build until in &lt;a href=\"4E%20201\"&gt;4E 201&lt;/a&gt;, when Ulfric killed &lt;a href=\"High%20King%20Torygg\"&gt;High King Torygg&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Solitude\"&gt;Solitude&lt;/a&gt;, with the power of his &lt;a href=\"Thu%27um\"&gt;Thu'um&lt;/a&gt;. The &lt;a href=\"Skyrim%20Civil%20War\"&gt;Skyrim Civil War&lt;/a&gt; had escalated even further, and it has raged on ever since.\nThe Dragon Crisis &amp; the World-Eater's Aerie.\nDuring the &lt;a href=\"Skyrim%20Civil%20War\"&gt;Skyrim Civil War&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"4E%20201\"&gt;4E 201&lt;/a&gt;, Ulfric Stormcloak and a group of the Stormcloaks were captured somewhere near the mining town of &lt;a href=\"Darkwater%20Crossing\"&gt;Darkwater Crossing&lt;/a&gt;. The group was taken to the Imperial fort town of &lt;a href=\"Helgen\"&gt;Helgen&lt;/a&gt;, located deep in the &lt;a href=\"Falkreath%20Hold\"&gt;Falkreath Hold&lt;/a&gt; near the &lt;a href=\"Pale%20Pass\"&gt;Pale Pass&lt;/a&gt;. Because of this momentous moment in the conflict, figures such as &lt;a href=\"General%20Tullius\"&gt;General Tullius&lt;/a&gt;, Military-Governor of Skyrim, and &lt;a href=\"Elenwen\"&gt;Elenwen&lt;/a&gt;, First Emissary of the &lt;a href=\"Thalmor\"&gt;Thalmor&lt;/a&gt;. Before Ulfric was killed, the &lt;a href=\"Dragons%20%28Lore%29\"&gt;Dragon&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Alduin\"&gt;Alduin&lt;/a&gt; attacked the city, and it was burned to the ground. Ulfric Stormcloak was able to escape back to Windhelm, continuing the fight against the Imperial Legion, albeit with the threat of the Dragons. According to rumors, the &lt;a href=\"Last%20Dragonborn\"&gt;Last Dragonborn&lt;/a&gt; of legend was present at Helgen, and so the &lt;a href=\"Dragon%20Crisis\"&gt;Dragon Crisis&lt;/a&gt; had occurred. As time went on, the Last Dragonborn came into contact with &lt;a href=\"the%20Blades\"&gt;the Blades&lt;/a&gt;, under the sole command of &lt;a href=\"Delphine\"&gt;Delphine&lt;/a&gt;. To prove this was indeed the Dragonborn, the pair had slain the Dragon, &lt;a href=\"Sahloknir\"&gt;Sahloknir&lt;/a&gt; on the outskirts of &lt;a href=\"Kynesgrove\"&gt;Kynesgrove&lt;/a&gt;, which was enough to prove the warrior's destiny. As time went on, Alduin had fled to the temple of &lt;a href=\"Skuldafn\"&gt;Skuldafn&lt;/a&gt;, after a grievous battle at the &lt;a href=\"Throat%20of%20the%20World\"&gt;Throat of the World&lt;/a&gt; with the Dragonborn and &lt;a href=\"Paarthurnax\"&gt;Paarthurnax&lt;/a&gt;. The Last Dragonborn, atop the Dragon, &lt;a href=\"Odahviing\"&gt;Odahviing&lt;/a&gt; had traveled Skuldafn. The warrior scaled the temple and defeated &lt;a href=\"Nahkriin\"&gt;Nahkriin&lt;/a&gt;, the Dragon Priest of Skuldafn. With the portal to &lt;a href=\"Sovngarde%20%28Location%29\"&gt;Sovngarde&lt;/a&gt; open, the Dragonborn entered and slain Alduin with the help of warriors from the past."}

The zone shares a border with the &lt;a href=\"The%20Rift%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Rift&lt;/a&gt; to the south, Morrowind to the east and &lt;a href=\"Bleakrock%20Isle\"&gt;Bleakrock Isle&lt;/a&gt; is located to the northeast of the hold, just off the coasts of &lt;a href=\"Solstheim\"&gt;Solstheim&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Vvardenfell\"&gt;Vvardenfell&lt;/a&gt;.\nBackground.\nThe zone stretches from Skyrim's jagged, northern &lt;a href=\"Velothi%20Mountains\"&gt;Velothi Mountains&lt;/a&gt; and the frozen &lt;a href=\"Sea%20of%20Ghosts\"&gt;Sea of Ghosts&lt;/a&gt; into the southern volcanic tundra, which is inhabited only by a few hardy settlers, and formidable creatures, including &lt;a href=\"Giant%20%28Online%29\"&gt;giants&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Mammoth%20%28Online%29\"&gt;mammoths&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Troll%20%28Online%29\"&gt;trolls&lt;/a&gt; and even &lt;a href=\"Vampirism%20%28Online%29\"&gt;vampires&lt;/a&gt;. Locals sometimes exchange whispers about the dangerous menaces that stalk the land. Hot springs, &lt;a href=\"giant%20camp\"&gt;giant camp&lt;/a&gt;s and ruins are common throughout the south of Eastmarch while the north of the zone is much more civilized, thanks to the presence of the ancient city of &lt;a href=\"Windhelm%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Windhelm&lt;/a&gt; and the surrounding towns and villages.\nDespite its size and importance, Eastmarch only has one major city, Windhelm, which sits at the mouth of the &lt;a href=\"White%20River\"&gt;White River&lt;/a&gt; which flows out into the Sea of Ghosts. The Windhelm docks provides a vital link to trade with the rest of the &lt;a href=\"Ebonheart%20Pact\"&gt;Ebonheart Pact&lt;/a&gt;, and there are several small fishing fleets in operation. The &lt;a href=\"Velothi%20Mountains\"&gt;Velothi Mountains&lt;/a&gt;, which span the entire eastern tip of Skyrim, create a natural border with &lt;a href=\"Morrowind%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Morrowind&lt;/a&gt;. The mountains are impassable, save for one pass outside of &lt;a href=\"Fullhelm%20Fort\"&gt;Fullhelm Fort&lt;/a&gt; north of &lt;a href=\"Fort%20Virak\"&gt;Fort Virak&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Stonefalls%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Stonefalls&lt;/a&gt;, that leads into and out of the Rift.\nEastmarch covers much of Skyrim's eastern border with Morrowind. The surrounding holds are &lt;a href=\"Winterhold%20%28Skyrim%20Hold%29\"&gt;Winterhold&lt;/a&gt; to the north, the &lt;a href=\"The%20Pale\"&gt;Pale&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Whiterun%20Hold\"&gt;Whiterun&lt;/a&gt; to the west and The Rift to the south.\nCentral Eastmarch is a volcanically active area, plains with steaming gas leaking in between cracks in the ground, colorful, mineral filled bodies of water, and geysers. The far west of the hold, a cold, snowy tundra, resembles much of the rest of northern Skyrim and the northern tundra is where the hold's capital Windhelm lies. The east is composed of the Velothi mountain range, which extends all the way down to Stonefalls in Morrowind.\nLocations.\nThe following are locations accessible in Eastmarch and, with the exception of &lt;a href=\"Unmarked%20Locations%20%28Online%29\"&gt;unmarked locations&lt;/a&gt;, are discoverable on the map. Points of Interest serve as locations with unique side quests, while &lt;a href=\"Cities%20%28Online%29\"&gt;cities&lt;/a&gt; serve as the centralised areas with multiple sublocations and act as a hub for services and &lt;a href=\"Merchants%20%28Online%29\"&gt;merchants&lt;/a&gt;. Explanations of the types of locations are provided in the &lt;a href=\"Locations%20%28Online%29%23Types\"&gt;main locations page&lt;/a&gt;.\nQuests.\nEastmarch features a series of zone story quests and unrelated side quests. The zone story quests tie into the Ebonheart Pact's overarching storyline and carries on from &lt;a href=\"Stormhaven\"&gt;Stormhaven&lt;/a&gt; before continuing to &lt;a href=\"The%20Rift%20%28Online%29\"&gt;The Rift&lt;/a&gt;, but it is not necessary to complete the story quests for zones prior to those in Eastmarch. Side quests are non-sequential and can be completed in any order, except where one carries on from another, and &lt;a href=\"repeatable%20quests\"&gt;repeatable quests&lt;/a&gt; can be completed multiple times: weekly for arenas and trials and daily for all others. Pointer quests are optional zone quests that send the Vestige to the tarting location of another zone quest.\nItem Sets.\nItem sets are related armor and weapons that, when worn together, provide unique benefits. Overland sets can be acquired from world bosses, world events, delves, public dungeons and containers and as quest rewards; dungeon sets can be acquired from within group dungeons; monster sets can be acquired from the final boss of veteran group dungeons and Undaunted Enclaves; and crafted sets can be created at specific locations across the zone.\nSkyshards.\nSixteen Skyshards can be found in Eastmarch totaling in five &lt;a href=\"skill%20points\"&gt;skill points&lt;/a&gt; with one left over. The zone guide provides clues as to the location of each Skyshard, but many can be found simply by exploring and watching for the distinctive pillar of light they emit. Skyshards will appear on the map and compass when the Vestige is close to one and will remain discovered on the map even if it was not collected.\nAchievements.\nAchievements can be earned by completing specific tasks such as completing quests and discovering locations. Achievements are separated into categories and their progress is viewable from the journal. Earning achievement provides the Vestige a number of points, and some achievements unlock unique rewards such as &lt;a href=\"Furnishings%20%28Online%29\"&gt;furnishings&lt;/a&gt; that can be bought from Achievement Furnishers or &lt;a href=\"collectibles\"&gt;collectibles&lt;/a&gt;.\nShalidor's Library.\nThirty-two books that are a part of Shalidor's Library can be found in Eastmarch and added to the collection. Books that have already been found in other zones will already be marked as completed in the zone tracker.\nFish.\nFish can be caught from fishing hotspots, ideally with the correct &lt;a href=\"bait\"&gt;bait&lt;/a&gt;. Common fish will be caught most often while rare fish and alternative bait are rare catches. Each zone has unique rare fish than can be caught from hotspots. &lt;a href=\"Slaughterfish%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Slaughterfish&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"trodh\"&gt;trodh&lt;/a&gt; can be caught from foul hotspots, &lt;a href=\"dhufish\"&gt;dhufish&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"longfin\"&gt;longfin&lt;/a&gt; can be caught from saltwater hotspots, &lt;a href=\"silverside%20perch\"&gt;silverside perch&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"spadetail\"&gt;spadetail&lt;/a&gt; can be caught from lake hotspots, and &lt;a href=\"Salmon%20%28Online%29\"&gt;salmon&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"River%20Betty%20%28Online%29\"&gt;river betty&lt;/a&gt; can be caught from river hotspots. &lt;a href=\"Chub\"&gt;Chub&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"minnow\"&gt;minnow&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"shad\"&gt;shad&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"fish%20roe\"&gt;fish roe&lt;/a&gt; can be caught and used as bait from foul, saltwater, lake and river hotspots, respectively."}

Ebon Stadmont is shrouded in mystery, with various tablets in an unknown language and a seemingly endless forest, with no end in sight.\nDescription.\nGeography.\nEbon Stadmont is a large forest off the road between &lt;a href=\"Sea%20Keep\"&gt;Sea Keep&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Cloudrest\"&gt;Cloudrest&lt;/a&gt;, along the river that flows down from the latter city-state. Beyond the road leads to a path into the forest, to which anyone can get immediately lost. The hills in Ebon Stadmont lead upwards to the Ebon Sanctum, which is nestled in the cliffs of &lt;a href=\"Eton%20Nir\"&gt;Eton Nir&lt;/a&gt;. Traversing the forest requires shifting portals which are the leading cause of very lost travelers. Upon entering the Ebon Sanctum, you are greeted with the typical Altmer ruins, covered in vines. Paths are leading to the rest of the temple, which each one are exposed to the outside. Dead woods emphasize how abandoned the temple is. Not much can be said about Ebon Stadmont, but along the roads towards the temple, there are tablets riddled in the unknown language to which Ebon Stadmont is known for.\nHistory.\n&lt;a href=\"Second%20Era\"&gt;Second Era&lt;/a&gt;.\nDuring the &lt;a href=\"Interregnum\"&gt;Interregnum&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"2E%20583\"&gt;2E 583&lt;/a&gt;, the forests of Ebon Stadmont were under investigation by &lt;a href=\"Andewen\"&gt;Andewen&lt;/a&gt;, an apprentice of &lt;a href=\"Telenger%20the%20Artificer\"&gt;Telenger the Artificer&lt;/a&gt; and member of the &lt;a href=\"Mages%20Guild\"&gt;Mages Guild&lt;/a&gt;. Andewen and her &lt;a href=\"Vestige\"&gt;friend&lt;/a&gt; traversed the forest, getting lost in the mists of Stadmont. Eventually, they reached the Ebon Sanctum, where they would be revealed the ugly truth. An ancient spirit that was dubbed, the &lt;a href=\"Spirit%20of%20Ebon%20Stadmont\"&gt;Spirit of Ebon Stadmont&lt;/a&gt; had tormented Andewen and her associate by taking them through time, all the while having them deal with her agent of some sort, &lt;a href=\"Fletch\"&gt;Fletch&lt;/a&gt;, an ancient member of the &lt;a href=\"House%20of%20Reveries\"&gt;House of Reveries&lt;/a&gt;, before &lt;a href=\"Grand%20Maestro%20Forte\"&gt;Grand Maestro Forte&lt;/a&gt; was the Grand Maestro. Andewen was endangered of being trapped in the Sanctum forever, though fortunately, the friend was able to escape Ebon Stadmont with &lt;a href=\"Trapped%20in%20Ebon%20Stadmont\"&gt;writings&lt;/a&gt; of Andewen's alternate self, who was trapped in Ebon Stadmont till her waning years. With these notes, the Mages Guild uncovered the dangerous truth of the legendary forest.\nAt around this time, the &lt;a href=\"Court%20of%20Bedlam\"&gt;Court of Bedlam&lt;/a&gt; had risen from the shadows, aiding their &lt;a href=\"Daedric%20Princes\"&gt;Daedric Princes&lt;/a&gt; in acquiring the Heart of &lt;a href=\"Transparent%20Law\"&gt;Transparent Law&lt;/a&gt; from the &lt;a href=\"Crystal%20Tower\"&gt;Crystal Tower&lt;/a&gt;. The &lt;a href=\"Psijic%20Order\"&gt;Psijic Order&lt;/a&gt; had undergone investigations of the Court, eventually capturing &lt;a href=\"Earl%20Leythen\"&gt;Earl Leythen&lt;/a&gt; of the &lt;a href=\"Mephala\"&gt;Mephala&lt;/a&gt; cult. As time went on, Earl Leythen had reluctantly helped the Psijic Order foil the plot of &lt;a href=\"Nocturnal\"&gt;Nocturnal&lt;/a&gt;, who had betrayed both Mephala and &lt;a href=\"Clavicus%20Vile\"&gt;Clavicus Vile&lt;/a&gt;. When it was revealed that &lt;a href=\"Iachesis\"&gt;Iachesis&lt;/a&gt; had hidden the Heart of Transparent Law, the Psijics needed to access the &lt;a href=\"Dreaming%20Cave\"&gt;Dreaming Cave&lt;/a&gt;, though they were unable to enter it, needing a passcode in an ancient language, one reminiscent to the one in Ebon Stadmont. And so, Leythen and a &lt;a href=\"Vestige\"&gt;friend&lt;/a&gt; of the Psijics sought to uncover the language at Ebon Stadmont, but Leythen was bound to &lt;a href=\"Artaeum\"&gt;Artaeum&lt;/a&gt;, so the friend carried a rune, which projected Leythen at their side. At Ebon Stadmont, the traveler gathered notes of Ebon Stadmont but was interrupted by Nocturnal's Earl, &lt;a href=\"Tundilwen\"&gt;Tundilwen&lt;/a&gt;, who told the traveler about the spell that would help them recover the Heart. With that information, the traveler returned to Iachesis at Artaeum.\n&lt;a href=\"Third%20Era\"&gt;Third Era&lt;/a&gt;.\nDuring the &lt;a href=\"Imperial%20Simulacrum\"&gt;Imperial Simulacrum&lt;/a&gt; from &lt;a href=\"3E%20389\"&gt;3E 389&lt;/a&gt; to &lt;a href=\"3E%20399\"&gt;3E 399&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Emperor\"&gt;Emperor&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Uriel%20Septim%20VII\"&gt;Uriel Septim VII&lt;/a&gt; was imprisoned along with &lt;a href=\"Talin%20Warhaft\"&gt;Talin Warhaft&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;a href=\"Deadlands\"&gt;Deadlands&lt;/a&gt; by &lt;a href=\"Jagar%20Tharn\"&gt;Jagar Tharn&lt;/a&gt;. Tharn planned for months to capture the throne, and he was able to achieve so in the span of ten years. Tharn had a powerful weapon called the &lt;a href=\"Staff%20of%20Chaos\"&gt;Staff of Chaos&lt;/a&gt;, and he split it into nine pieces and scattered them across Tamriel, the staff was the only thing keeping Uriel Septim and Warhaft in &lt;a href=\"Oblivion\"&gt;Oblivion&lt;/a&gt;. A warrior escaped his clutches and traveled all corners of Tamriel to retrieve the missing pieces. The hero was known as the &lt;a href=\"Eternal%20Champion\"&gt;Eternal Champion&lt;/a&gt;, and he assembled the staff and defeated Jagar Tharn at the &lt;a href=\"Imperial%20Palace\"&gt;Imperial Palace&lt;/a&gt;. The Eternal Champion had at one point visited the town of Ebon Stadmont in their quest to recover the pieces."}

Ebonheart, by tradition, has been the ancestral seat of power for &lt;a href=\"House%20Ra%27athim\"&gt;House Ra'athim&lt;/a&gt;, whose lineage have ruled as Morrowind's greatest leaders, including &lt;a href=\"Barenziah\"&gt;Barenziah&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Katariah\"&gt;Katariah&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Moraelyn\"&gt;Moraelyn&lt;/a&gt;.\nDescription.\nGeography.\nThe city of Ebonheart sits on an island along the southern shores of the &lt;a href=\"Inner%20Sea\"&gt;Inner Sea&lt;/a&gt;, a large body of water that separates the island of &lt;a href=\"Vvardenfell\"&gt;Vvardenfell&lt;/a&gt; from the rest of Morrowind. Based on Ebonheart's geography and the layout of the &lt;a href=\"Ascadian%20Isles\"&gt;Ascadian Isles&lt;/a&gt; on Vvardenfell, it can be assumed that the island that Ebonheart is in, was once where the city of &lt;a href=\"Vivec%20City\"&gt;Vivec&lt;/a&gt; is located. The city of Ebonheart is small, to say the least, the town is built like a fortress, and the center of the city is where most Ebonheart's commerce occurs. The Inner City has the &lt;a href=\"Town%20Hall%20%28Stonefalls%29\"&gt;Town Hall&lt;/a&gt; in the north, overlooking the Argonian District and the Inner Sea, it has clear sight of Vvardenfell. The eastern end has several homes and the local &lt;a href=\"The%20Ebony%20Flask\"&gt;Ebony Flask Inn&lt;/a&gt;. The &lt;a href=\"Fighters%20Guild\"&gt;Fighters Guild&lt;/a&gt; tends to sent up camp near the Inn.\nThe western end of town is where many of the residents live as well as several House nobles. The local temple resides in the west wing as well, for the longest time, the temple was built to worship the &lt;a href=\"Tribunal\"&gt;False Tribunal&lt;/a&gt;, a group of ancient gods that had significant influence over Morrowind for years, since the later years of its inception. The current gods that are worshipped are the &lt;a href=\"House%20of%20Reclamations\"&gt;House of Reclamations&lt;/a&gt;, which consists of &lt;a href=\"Azura\"&gt;Azura&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Boethiah\"&gt;Boethiah&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Mephala\"&gt;Mephala&lt;/a&gt;. North of the temple is the dockyards, where the city's fishers go to get their daily catch. North of the Inner City is the Argonian District, the home of several Argonian slaves or former slaves that decided to remain in Ebonheart. Argonians during the &lt;a href=\"Interregnum\"&gt;Interregnum&lt;/a&gt; planted a &lt;a href=\"Hist\"&gt;Hist&lt;/a&gt; Sapling in the center of town. The Ebonheart Outskirts in the south is where the local militia gathers, as well as refugees of war, or foreigners.\nThe location of the &lt;a href=\"Clockwork%20City\"&gt;Clockwork City&lt;/a&gt; is unknown; sources say that is somewhere within the &lt;a href=\"Deshaan%20Plains\"&gt;Deshaan Plains&lt;/a&gt; near the city of &lt;a href=\"Tear\"&gt;Tear&lt;/a&gt;. Sources have stated that the location of the compound is somewhere underneath the town of Ebonheart.\nHistory.\n&lt;a href=\"First%20Era\"&gt;First Era&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe Dunmer of House Ra'athim &amp; Modern-Ebonheart.\nThe city-state of Ebonheart has been a city of &lt;a href=\"House%20Ra%27athim\"&gt;House Ra'athim&lt;/a&gt; for many years, being the High Kings of Morrowind for many years, and owning lucrative mines throughout the province. Amidst the &lt;a href=\"Skyrim%20Conquests\"&gt;Skyrim Conquests&lt;/a&gt;, Ebonheart was conquered by the &lt;a href=\"Nords\"&gt;Nords&lt;/a&gt;, until it was retaken via guerrilla warfare by the nobility of the Ra'athim, under &lt;a href=\"King%20Kronin\"&gt;King Kronin&lt;/a&gt; and his three sons, Cruethys, &lt;a href=\"S%27ephen\"&gt;S'ephen&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Moraelyn\"&gt;Moraelyn&lt;/a&gt;. Eventually, Cruethys assumed the throne, and would later pass it to his younger brother, Moraelyn. S'ephen was not a legitimate heir and was unable to continue from Cruethys' reign. Ultimately, Moraelyn's daughter, &lt;a href=\"Lian%20Ra%27athim\"&gt;Lian Ra'athim&lt;/a&gt; had become Queen of Ebonheart, having twin sons that were made joint heirs. The seat of High King was left vacant, in favor of a temporary War Leader. Mournhold was given the &lt;a href=\"Staff%20of%20Chaos\"&gt;Staff of Chaos&lt;/a&gt;, as it was S'ephen's birthplace. The rivalry between the two city-states had grown.\n&lt;a href=\"Second%20Era\"&gt;Second Era&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe Second Akaviri Invasion &amp; the Ebonheart Pact.\nIn &lt;a href=\"2E%20572\"&gt;2E 572&lt;/a&gt;, the Snow Demons of &lt;a href=\"Kamal\"&gt;Kamal&lt;/a&gt; invaded the continent of &lt;a href=\"Tamriel\"&gt;Tamriel&lt;/a&gt; and ravaged the northern provinces from as far as the &lt;a href=\"Telvanni%20Peninsula\"&gt;Telvanni Peninsula&lt;/a&gt; to &lt;a href=\"Eastmarch\"&gt;Eastmarch&lt;/a&gt;. At one point, the Snow Demons besieged the city of &lt;a href=\"Windhelm\"&gt;Windhelm&lt;/a&gt; and moved southwards near the town of Ebonheart, near the site known as &lt;a href=\"Vivec%27s%20Antlers\"&gt;Vivec's Antlers&lt;/a&gt;. Snow Demons were surrounded from all sides. To the west was the &lt;a href=\"Nord\"&gt;Nord&lt;/a&gt;ic Army led by &lt;a href=\"Jorunn%20the%20Skald-King\"&gt;Jorunn the Skald-King&lt;/a&gt; and the shade of &lt;a href=\"Wulfharth\"&gt;Wulfharth Ash-King&lt;/a&gt;. To the east was the &lt;a href=\"Dunmer\"&gt;Dunmer&lt;/a&gt;i Army led by &lt;a href=\"Tanval%20Indoril\"&gt;Tanval Indoril&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Almalexia\"&gt;Almalexia&lt;/a&gt; of the Tribunal, and to the south was the &lt;a href=\"Argonian\"&gt;Argonian&lt;/a&gt; Army led by &lt;a href=\"Vicecanon%20Heita-Meen\"&gt;Vicecanon Heita-Meen&lt;/a&gt;. These combined forces managed to defeat the Snow Demons and send them back to &lt;a href=\"Akavir\"&gt;Akavir&lt;/a&gt;. The battle that ended the &lt;a href=\"Second%20Akaviri%20Invasion\"&gt;Second Akaviri Invasion&lt;/a&gt; was known as the &lt;a href=\"Battle%20of%20Stonefalls\"&gt;Battle of Stonefalls&lt;/a&gt;. Following the events of the battle, the leaders of the defensive force created the First &lt;a href=\"Ebonheart%20Pact\"&gt;Ebonheart Pact&lt;/a&gt;, an alliance consisting of the Nords of &lt;a href=\"Old%20Holds\"&gt;Eastern Skyrim&lt;/a&gt;, the Dunmer of &lt;a href=\"Morrowind\"&gt;Morrowind&lt;/a&gt;, and the Argonians of &lt;a href=\"Black%20Marsh\"&gt;Black Marsh&lt;/a&gt;. The name of the alliance came from the city it was founded in, Ebonheart.\nTreason within Ebonheart &amp; the Dres Occupation of Ebonheart.\nDuring the &lt;a href=\"Interregnum\"&gt;Interregnum&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"2E%20582\"&gt;2E 582&lt;/a&gt;, the region of &lt;a href=\"Stonefalls\"&gt;Stonefalls&lt;/a&gt; was at war with the &lt;a href=\"Daggerfall%20Covenant\"&gt;Daggerfall Covenant&lt;/a&gt; and as a result, many settlements were attacked during the conflict. Places such as &lt;a href=\"Davon%27s%20Watch\"&gt;Davon's Watch&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Fort%20Zeren\"&gt;Fort Zeren&lt;/a&gt; were assaulted in by the Covenant. The war had not reached the city of Ebonheart, but events in the town would have lead to the fall of the &lt;a href=\"Ebonheart%20Pact\"&gt;Ebonheart Pact&lt;/a&gt;. The city was ruled by &lt;a href=\"Drathus%20Othral\"&gt;Drathus Othral&lt;/a&gt;, back when the settlement was under the control of &lt;a href=\"House%20Dres\"&gt;House Dres&lt;/a&gt;. Parts of the Covenant Armada landed on the shores of &lt;a href=\"Vivec%27s%20Antlers\"&gt;Vivec's Antlers&lt;/a&gt;, which is not far from Ebonheart, and yet, the people of Ebonheart have squabbles with each other and would not cooperate to defeat the invading force. Othral tasked an Outlander called the &lt;a href=\"Vestige\"&gt;Vestige&lt;/a&gt; to bring the people together in their time of need.\nWith the help of the Vestige, the denizens of Ebonheart came together to join the Ebonheart Pact in their battle against the Daggerfall Covenant. A &lt;a href=\"Dunmer\"&gt;Dunmer&lt;/a&gt; man named &lt;a href=\"Rhavil%20Urano\"&gt;Rhavil Urano&lt;/a&gt; was conducting the disagreements with the townsfolk, and he was acting suspiciously throughout the city. Othral tasked the Vestige to investigate his recent activities to see a connection between him and the Covenant Armada. Urano went to a shack on the Ebonheart Dockyards and left several minutes later. The Vestige uncovered a magical book and an apparition of a &lt;a href=\"Alexandra%20Conele\"&gt;Covenant Officer&lt;/a&gt;. Urano was working with the Covenant and brought them to Ebonheart through messages. The information leaked and the Urano was killed by the Vestige.\nVivec's Fateful Visit to Ebonheart.\nIn &lt;a href=\"2E%20583\"&gt;2E 583&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Lord%20Vivec\"&gt;Lord Vivec&lt;/a&gt; of the &lt;a href=\"Tribunal\"&gt;Tribunal&lt;/a&gt;, traveled to the city of Ebonheart and was enthralled by the city's atmosphere. He studied the city's architecture and wandered the streets in awe. He took notes in his notebook, notes about every detail he witnessed in the city. His time there left him behind schedule and left his entourage in distress. After several hours of studying, Vivec wanted to build another Ebonheart on Vvardenfell. He felt that the island located southwest of &lt;a href=\"Vivec%20City\"&gt;Vivec City&lt;/a&gt; was fitting for the location. It was one that day; construction began in the city of &lt;a href=\"Ebonheart%20%28Morrowind%29\"&gt;Ebonheart&lt;/a&gt; on Vvardenfell.\n&lt;a href=\"Third%20Era\"&gt;Third Era&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe Rise of Katariah Ra'athim &amp; Pelagius the Mad.\nDuring his reign as the &lt;a href=\"Emperor\"&gt;Emperor&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"Tamriel\"&gt;Tamriel&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Pelagius%20Septim%20III\"&gt;Pelagius Septim III&lt;/a&gt; married &lt;a href=\"Katariah%20Ra%27athim\"&gt;Katariah Ra'athim&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"House%20Ra%27athim\"&gt;House Ra'athim&lt;/a&gt;, to establish relations with the &lt;a href=\"Third%20Empire\"&gt;Third Empire&lt;/a&gt; and the city of Ebonheart. Since Ebonheart was nearby the city of &lt;a href=\"Mournhold\"&gt;Mournhold&lt;/a&gt;, it was necessary since Ebonheart was also against the Empire during the &lt;a href=\"War%20of%20the%20Red%20Diamond\"&gt;War of the Red Diamond&lt;/a&gt;. It was around this time, Pelagius III was known as the Pelagius the Mad, so he had quite the reputation, ever since his reign of the &lt;a href=\"Kingdom%20of%20Solitude\"&gt;Kingdom of Solitude&lt;/a&gt;. Katariah was one of the few people to hide Pelagius' madness from the rest of the Empire. While Pelagius III was playing his toes like the madman he was, Katariah and the &lt;a href=\"Elder%20Council\"&gt;Elder Council&lt;/a&gt; would control the Empire. Pelagius was eventually taken to an asylum at the city of &lt;a href=\"Torval\"&gt;Torval&lt;/a&gt;, and Katariah ruled the Empire from the &lt;a href=\"Imperial%20City\"&gt;Imperial City&lt;/a&gt;. Pelagius would later pass away on the Isle of &lt;a href=\"Betony\"&gt;Betony&lt;/a&gt; at the Temple of &lt;a href=\"Kynareth\"&gt;Kynareth&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe Staff of Chaos &amp; Dagoth-Ur.\nDuring the &lt;a href=\"Imperial%20Simulacrum\"&gt;Imperial Simulacrum&lt;/a&gt; from &lt;a href=\"3E%20389\"&gt;3E 389&lt;/a&gt; to &lt;a href=\"3E%20399\"&gt;3E 399&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Emperor\"&gt;Emperor&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Uriel%20Septim%20VII\"&gt;Uriel Septim VII&lt;/a&gt; was imprisoned along with &lt;a href=\"Talin%20Warhaft\"&gt;Talin Warhaft&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;a href=\"Deadlands\"&gt;Deadlands&lt;/a&gt; by &lt;a href=\"Jagar%20Tharn\"&gt;Jagar Tharn&lt;/a&gt;. Tharn planned for months to capture the throne, and he was able to achieve so in ten years. Tharn had a powerful weapon called the &lt;a href=\"Staff%20of%20Chaos\"&gt;Staff of Chaos&lt;/a&gt;, and he split it into nine pieces and scattered them across Tamriel, the staff was the only thing keeping Uriel Septim and Warhaft in &lt;a href=\"Oblivion\"&gt;Oblivion&lt;/a&gt;. A warrior escaped his clutches and traveled all corners of Tamriel to retrieve the missing pieces. The hero was known as the &lt;a href=\"Eternal%20Champion\"&gt;Eternal Champion&lt;/a&gt;, and he assembled the staff and defeated Jagar Tharn at the &lt;a href=\"Imperial%20Palace\"&gt;Imperial Palace&lt;/a&gt;. The Eternal Champion had at one point visited the city of Ebonheart in their quest to recover the pieces. The city of Ebonheart was under the rule of &lt;a href=\"King%20Casik\"&gt;King Casik&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe Eternal Champion reached the city of Ebonheart on their quest to find the final piece of the Staff. Residents told the Champion to visit King Casik, to see if he knew of the location. The Champion arrived into Casik's domain, and the King gave him a proposition. The King asked that the Champion retrieves the &lt;a href=\"Hammer%20of%20Gharen\"&gt;Hammer of Gharen&lt;/a&gt;, and he would give the location of the piece. The warrior traveled to &lt;a href=\"Black%20Gate\"&gt;Black Gate&lt;/a&gt; and took the Hammer of Gharen. They gave the King the Hammer, and in return, the King pointed the way to &lt;a href=\"Red%20Mountain\"&gt;Red Mountain&lt;/a&gt;. The Champion was able to take the final piece, and they ventured to the &lt;a href=\"Imperial%20City\"&gt;Imperial City&lt;/a&gt; to confront Jagar Tharn."}

The dour, magically-gifted &lt;a href=\"Dunmer%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Dunmer&lt;/a&gt; of Morrowind have joined the reptilian &lt;a href=\"Argonians%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Argonians&lt;/a&gt;\u2014former slaves from mysterious Black Marsh\u2014and boisterous &lt;a href=\"Nords%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Nords&lt;/a&gt; of Skyrim in a bid for sovereignty.\nFounded in the midst of the Akaviri Invasion of &lt;a href=\"2E%20572\"&gt;2E 572&lt;/a&gt;, the territory of the Ebonheart Pact stretched over the provinces of Skyrim, Morrowind and Black Marsh at the height of its power. Its capital is the city of &lt;a href=\"Mournhold%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Mournhold&lt;/a&gt;, located on the mainland of Morrowind, the homeland of the Dunmer, though\u00a0the faction is led by a Nord nobleman known as\u00a0&lt;a href=\"Jorunn%20the%20Skald-King\"&gt;Jorunn the Skald-King&lt;/a&gt;.\nOne of the most politically unstable but militaristically powerful among the most powerful alliances of &lt;a href=\"Tamriel\"&gt;Tamriel&lt;/a&gt;ic history, the three cultures that comprise the Ebonheart Pact shared a great distrust for each other, only holding allegiance to one another\u00a0because of a common desire to defeat the Empire and preserve their homelands' independence.\nAfter the sack of Windhelm and the death of Skyrim's royal family,\u00a0the &lt;a href=\"Akaviri\"&gt;Akaviri&lt;/a&gt; began their march south towards the city of &lt;a href=\"Riften%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Riften&lt;/a&gt;. In grief and desperation, Jorunn, now the &lt;a href=\"High%20King\"&gt;High King&lt;/a&gt;, approached &lt;a href=\"The%20Greybeards\"&gt;The Greybeards&lt;/a&gt; for guidance. The Greybeards answered his plea, and called upon &lt;a href=\"Wulfharth\"&gt;Wulfharth&lt;/a&gt; the Ash-King from &lt;a href=\"Sovngarde%20%28Location%29\"&gt;Sovngarde&lt;/a&gt; for assistance. Inspired by\u00a0Wulfharth,\u00a0Jorunn's army of Nord warriors stood ready to confront the Akaviri invaders on their own terms.\nRecognizing the regrouped Nords as the primary threat to their expedition in &lt;a href=\"Tamriel\"&gt;Tamriel&lt;/a&gt;, the Akaviri opted to avoid a second confrontation and marched directly for Morrowind, gambling the Nords would ignore them once they moved beyond Skyrim's borders. Jorunn's men pursued the Akaviri across the &lt;a href=\"Velothi%20Mountains\"&gt;Velothi Mountains&lt;/a&gt; and forcibly pushed them into Morrowind. The Akaviri army was met by a Dunmer army led by the &lt;a href=\"Tribunal%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Tribunal&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Almalexia%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Almalexia&lt;/a&gt; outside &lt;a href=\"Ebonheart%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Ebonheart&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;a href=\"Stonefalls%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Stonefalls&lt;/a&gt; region. As the invaders engaged the Dunmer army, the Nords fell upon the Akaviri from the rear, but the invaders still outnumbered their foes. Suddenly, an Argonian army arrived from the south, led by &lt;a href=\"Heita-Meen\"&gt;Heita-Meen&lt;/a&gt;, a female Argonian, who had been shown the battle in a dream weeks before by the &lt;a href=\"Hist\"&gt;Hist&lt;/a&gt; and gathered an army to meet them. Surrounded on three sides, the Akaviri were forced north into the sea. There they either fell in combat or drowned as they fled into the water. This victory over the Akaviri forces played a crucial role in the later creation of the Ebonheart Pact.\nFollowing the Akaviri defeat,\u00a0the Nords, Dunmer and Argonians formed the &lt;a href=\"Great%20Moot\"&gt;Great Moot&lt;/a&gt;. The three cultures henceforth struck as a single army, ultimately repelling the entire invasion of the Akaviri slavemasters.\nIn 2E 579, the Ebonheart Pact controls the largest area of Tamriel's landmass out of the three alliances.\nLeadership.\nDespite the godlike power of the Dunmeri\u00a0Tribunal, the faction was led by the High King of Skyrim. However, he\u00a0did not rule absolutely. All governing decisions had to be brought up and discussed in the Great Moot to be approved.\nThe Great Moot is comprised of 3 members:\nWhen the Great Moot assembled at &lt;a href=\"Skuldafn%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Skuldafn&lt;/a&gt; after Pact forces defeated &lt;a href=\"Fildgor%20Orcthane\"&gt;Fildgor Orcthane&lt;/a&gt;'s army, each member presented an object of power before beginning the meeting. Jorunn Skald-King presented the &lt;a href=\"Crown%20of%20Freydis\"&gt;Crown of Freydis&lt;/a&gt;, Yeveth Noramil presented the &lt;a href=\"Veloth%27s%20Judgement%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Judgement of Veloth&lt;/a&gt;, and Eyes-of-Steel presented the &lt;a href=\"Mnemic%20Egg\"&gt;Mnemic Egg&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe following are the opening statements of the leaders at the beginning of the Moot at Skuldafn:\nKing Jorunn: \"Esteemed allies, I stand before my ancestors at this holy Dragon Shrine to seal our Pact for the greater good.\"\nEyes-of-Steel: \"I stand on this mountain to proclaim how far the Argonians have come from the swamps of Black Marsh. In the name of my people, I add my voice to form the Ebonheart Pact.\"\nGeneral Noramil: \"I represent the Dunmer and the Tribunal. I stand on this frigid rock to affirm our place in the Ebonheart Pact. I fervently hope we can move this along, because it's freezing up here.\"\nKing Jorunn: \"The Nords offer the Crown of Freydis. The symbol of power and wisdom provides the Pact with the strength and authority of our Nord ancestors.\"\nGeneral Noramil: \"The Dunmer offer the Judgement of Veloth, an artifact of ancient magic. This provides the Pact with our skills and the blessing of the Tribunal.\"\nEyes-of-Steel: \"The Argonians offer the Mnemic Egg, sacred symbol of birth and life, thus granting our wisdom, and the memories of the Hist, to the Pact. With these offerings the Pact is sealed. Let our nations become one!\"\nGeneral Noramil: \"Further, the Dunmer call for a single leader to hold this Pact together. We believe Skald-King Jorunn is the one to lead us.\"\nKing Jorunn: \"Let our enemies tremble at our combined might. I accept the role of High King of the Ebonheart Pact. We have much to discuss here. Please, champion, return to &lt;a href=\"Jorunn%27s%20Stand\"&gt;Jorunn's Stand&lt;/a&gt; and inform my son what has transpired here.\"\nJorunn the Skald-King was said to be humorous and inspiring, but also harbored an iron will. Despite the fact that the seat of power in Skyrim was the city of &lt;a href=\"Windhelm%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Windhelm&lt;/a&gt;, Jorunn spent most of his time in Mournhold where the rest of the Moot was represented.\nMembers.\n&lt;a href=\"Nords%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Nords&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe leading race of the Ebonheart Pact. They were known as the great conquerors: Nords once broke the power of the &lt;a href=\"Ayleid\"&gt;Ayleid&lt;/a&gt;s, drove the Snow Elves out of Skyrim, nearly drove the &lt;a href=\"Altmer%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Altmer&lt;/a&gt; out of &lt;a href=\"High%20Rock%20%28Online%29\"&gt;High Rock&lt;/a&gt; and ruled much of Morrowind before the arrival of the Dunmer.\nThey believe themselves to be the\u00a0destined rulers of Tamriel. Nords are amongst the fiercest warriors on the continent, facing their enemies\u00a0with\u00a0unmatched ferocity and courage.\nTheir symbol is the &lt;a href=\"Dragons%20%28Lore%29\"&gt;Dragon&lt;/a&gt;, the great winged children of Akatosh who were once worshipped by the Nords and are the\u00a0original users of the\u00a0&lt;a href=\"Thu%27um\"&gt;Thu'um&lt;/a&gt; which has been the greatest tool of war in Nordic history.\n&lt;a href=\"Dunmer%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Dunmer&lt;/a&gt;.\nKnown for their application of\u00a0diplomacy, subterfuge and\u00a0strategic ability, the\u00a0Dunmer have had a long history of defending against provincial invasions. This had made them a very paranoid collective, and their culture learned to embrace this mind-set. The Dunmer\u00a0are led by the living gods of the Tribunal.\nNot all of the Dunmer agreed to set aside their old hatreds for the Argonians for the sake of the Ebonheart Pact, with &lt;a href=\"House%20Telvanni%20%28Online%29\"&gt;House Telvanni&lt;/a&gt; being a prominent example. The Dunmer crest symbolizes the three members of the Tribunal.\n&lt;a href=\"Argonians%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Argonians&lt;/a&gt;.\nFamous for\u00a0employing\u00a0guerrilla warfare, Argonians had suffered years of slavery at the hands of the Dunmer. After being freed from their slavery, their experiences made them skilled in defending their borders from much larger forces.\nKnown for their ability to survive underwater and their unique scavenger skills, Argonians served as the scouts and skirmishers of the Pact.\nQuests.\nThe questline of the Ebonheart Pact is experienced in the zone story quests of each zone within Ebonheart Pact territory. In chonological order, the zones of the Pact storyline are &lt;a href=\"Bleakrock%20Isle\"&gt;Bleakrock Isle&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Bal%20Foyen\"&gt;Bal Foyen&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Stonefalls%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Stonefalls&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Deshaan%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Deshaan&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Shadowfen\"&gt;Shadowfen&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Eastmarch%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Eastmarch&lt;/a&gt;, and the &lt;a href=\"The%20Rift%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Rift&lt;/a&gt;.\n&lt;onlyinclude&gt;&lt;/onlyinclude&gt;"}

It resembles an &lt;a href=\"ebony\"&gt;ebony&lt;/a&gt; katana, and grows more powerful with each life it takes. It seems to become especially powerful after taking the lives of close friends and using deceit to murder. However, it seems to warp the mind of the user.\nHistory.\nThe blade has changed hands many times over the years. It is believed that the &lt;a href=\"Eternal%20Champion\"&gt;Eternal Champion&lt;/a&gt; himself once wielded the blade when it was discovered in &lt;a href=\"Valenwood\"&gt;Valenwood&lt;/a&gt;. Later, it was given to the &lt;a href=\"Hero%20of%20Daggerfall\"&gt;Hero of Daggerfall&lt;/a&gt; sometime after the &lt;a href=\"War%20of%20Betony\"&gt;War of Betony&lt;/a&gt;. It fell into the hands of the &lt;a href=\"Morag%20Tong\"&gt;Morag Tong&lt;/a&gt; at one point. In order to obtain the weapon, one must summon Mephala on the 13th of &lt;a href=\"Frostfall\"&gt;Frostfall&lt;/a&gt; (&lt;a href=\"Witches%20Festival\"&gt;Witches Festival&lt;/a&gt;) and prove their worth to her.\nThe thief-god &lt;a href=\"Rajhin\"&gt;Rajhin&lt;/a&gt; is said to have stolen the blade on his way out from stealing the &lt;a href=\"Ring%20of%20Khajiit\"&gt;Ring of Khajiit&lt;/a&gt;.\nIn the early &lt;a href=\"Second%20Era\"&gt;Second Era&lt;/a&gt;, an adventurer named &lt;a href=\"Nerien%27eth\"&gt;Nerien'eth&lt;/a&gt; brought the blade to his school at &lt;a href=\"Agea%20Relle\"&gt;Agea Relle&lt;/a&gt;, thinking it was an &lt;a href=\"Akaviri\"&gt;Akaviri&lt;/a&gt; artifact. Mephala's whispers drove him insane, and led him to murder and torture his wife, students, and colleagues. His wife &lt;a href=\"Alanwe\"&gt;Alanwe&lt;/a&gt; led a &lt;a href=\"Undaunted\"&gt;group of adventurers&lt;/a&gt; to reclaim the school and free the souls of those he murdered. Nerien'eth was defeated, but Mephala attempted to sway Alanwe by claiming to help her destroy the blade. Instead, Alanwe sacrificed herself to keep the blade away from those who desire it (at least for quite a while), disappearing with the blade.\nIn the late &lt;a href=\"Third%20Era\"&gt;Third Era&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"Hero%20of%20Kvatch\"&gt;Hero of Kvatch&lt;/a&gt; was granted the blade by Mephala. Later, in the\u00a0&lt;a href=\"Fourth%20Era\"&gt;Fourth Era&lt;/a&gt;, it was discovered by\u00a0&lt;a href=\"Jarl\"&gt;Jarl&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Balgruuf%20the%20Greater\"&gt;Balgruuf the Greater&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"Whiterun%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Whiterun&lt;/a&gt; sometime before the events of .

In this case, it can only be started using the &lt;a href=\"Console%20Commands%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;console command&lt;/a&gt; codice_1.\nSmithing.\nThe blade cannot be upgraded. This is explained in \"&lt;a href=\"Admonition%20Against%20Ebony\"&gt;Admonition Against Ebony&lt;/a&gt;\" which states that: \"\"Not even the hottest fires of the &lt;a href=\"Skyforge%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Skyforge&lt;/a&gt; could melt it; indeed the coals themselves seemed to cool when it was placed within,\"\" revealing the sword's immunity to heat or normal forging/smithing techniques.\nEnchantment.\nThis weapon starts with a 10-point &lt;a href=\"Absorb%20Health%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Absorb Health&lt;/a&gt; enchantment that can be increased by slaying &lt;a href=\"Disposition\"&gt;friendly characters&lt;/a&gt;. For example, anyone whose favor has been completed or who has been won over during any type of quest can be absorbed by the blade. For every two such characters killed, the weapon's Absorb Health enchantment increases by four points. Killing ten friendly characters maximizes its power at 30 points Absorb Health per hit.\nThe enchantment has unlimited uses and never needs recharging.\nMephala's voice sounds each time the enchantment improves, commenting on the progress of the blade. Her dialogue, in order, is such:\nMephala's comments.\nIf the hilt glows red, the blade has gained power.\nPotential kills.\nCharacters who say things such as, \"It's a fine day with you around.\" or \"You've been a good friend to me, that means something.\" are considered friendly to the Dragonborn and will count as a charge. Another indication is whether or not taking low-value items from their home counts as stealing. Anyone to whom the Dragonborn sells firewood, ore, food, or alchemical ingredients via a dialogue option (not the barter menu) will become friendly. The Dragonborn can also make friends by dropping a weapon or a piece of armor somewhere, prompting characters to approach them and ask whether or not the item is free for the taking. Saying \"yes\" will make them friendly.\nIt should be noted that killing a hostile character that has been temporarily calmed with the use of a spell or the &lt;a href=\"Bend%20Will\"&gt;Bend Will&lt;/a&gt; shout does not count as a charge.\nThe following is a list of potential targets for upgrading the Ebony Blade:\nDaedric quests.\nPlayers are advised to acquire this weapon as soon as possible before beginning the rest of the Daedric quests. Using the Ebony Blade throughout this particular questline will provide almost all the kills required to return its enchantment.\nWeapon classification.\nThe blade behaves as a two-handed weapon with the following exceptions:\nThough it uses a two-handed mesh file, it uses the template for a one-handed weapon, resulting in improper sound files, attack speed, damage, weight, perk benefits, impact force, and stamina usage.\nAs of &lt;a href=\"https%3A//web.archive.org/web/20161103033710/http%3A//www.bethblog.com/2013/03/04/now-on-steam-skyrim-1-9-beta-update/\"&gt;patch 1.9&lt;/a&gt;, this has been fixed, and the sword benefits from the &lt;a href=\"Two-Handed%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;two-handed&lt;/a&gt; weapon skill and perks.\nUsefulness.\nThe Ebony Blade is, in some ways, an upgraded version of the &lt;a href=\"Blade%20of%20Woe%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Blade of Woe&lt;/a&gt;; it is two-handed and has unlimited charges. Its attack speed is faster than any other two-handed weapon (about as fast as a &lt;a href=\"Swords%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;one-handed sword&lt;/a&gt;), though it has the lowest damage per hit. The unlimited enchantment charge and heightened attack speed helps to make up for the reduced damage.\nPrior to patch 1.9, the blade was useful for training the two-handed skill on those who did not often use it, because its damage was dependent on the one-handed skill. This gave it a significant damage bonus over other weapons, while the two-handed skill was still low. However, for those that normally used two-handed weapons, this weapon was a poor choice, as it did not benefit from any of the progress or perks of the two-handed skill.\nSince patch 1.9, the Ebony Blade benefits from the two-handed perks and skill, while still retaining the advantage of unlimited charges, and the speed of a one-handed sword. The Ebony Blade does not affect &lt;a href=\"animunculi\"&gt;animunculi&lt;/a&gt;, as it will not steal health from them; thus, this makes it a poor choice for combat in &lt;a href=\"Dwemer%20Ruins%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Dwemer Ruins&lt;/a&gt;."}

When not engaged in combat, they are found folded up into a large metal ball shape roughly a meter in diameter, rolling around via a pair of diagonal wheels on either side. When they sense an intruder nearby, Dwarven Spheres will open up and unfold their body to full height, attacking with whatever weapons are mounted on their forearms. They can also appear out of massive pipes in the walls, popping out when a nearby trap is triggered, or simply if an intruder gets too close.\nCombat.\nThough they appear lanky, Dwarven Spheres are fast and tough, and can easily defeat those who are low-leveled. They are often armed with a sword blade mounted on one forearm and a crossbow on the other, allowing them to attack both up-close and from afar.\nDwarven Spheres are stalwart opponents, resistant to all magic, and immune to &lt;a href=\"Poison%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;poison&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Frost%20Damage%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;frost&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Illusion%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Illusion&lt;/a&gt; magic (unless the &lt;a href=\"Last%20Dragonborn\"&gt;Dragonborn&lt;/a&gt; obtains the &lt;a href=\"Master%20of%20the%20Mind\"&gt;Master of the Mind&lt;/a&gt; perk). They are resistant to the vampiric drain spell. When using &lt;a href=\"Dragon%20Shouts\"&gt;Dragon Shouts&lt;/a&gt;, they cannot be frozen with &lt;a href=\"Ice%20Form\"&gt;Ice Form&lt;/a&gt;, and a fully charged &lt;a href=\"Unrelenting%20Force%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Unrelenting Force&lt;/a&gt; will only stagger them, not send them flying. They can also be staggered with the &lt;a href=\"Impact\"&gt;Impact&lt;/a&gt; perk, albeit very briefly.\nLoot.\nWhen defeated, Dwarven Spheres will drop a random number of &lt;a href=\"Dwemer\"&gt;Dwarven&lt;/a&gt; metal parts, &lt;a href=\"Dwarven%20Oil%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Dwarven oil&lt;/a&gt;, as well as varying levels of filled &lt;a href=\"Soul%20Gem%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;soul gems&lt;/a&gt;, making them useful for those who wield magic &lt;a href=\"Staves%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;staves&lt;/a&gt; or enchanted weapons. They will also drop &lt;a href=\"dwarven%20bolt\"&gt;dwarven bolt&lt;/a&gt;s if has been installed. Rarely, they will also drop &lt;a href=\"Centurion%20Dynamo%20Core\"&gt;Centurion dynamo cores&lt;/a&gt;."}

The proper term to use when referencing the ancient lost race of &lt;a href=\"Tamriel\"&gt;Tamriel&lt;/a&gt; is \"&lt;a href=\"Dwemer\"&gt;Dwemer&lt;/a&gt;.\" It is a word whose meaning is roughly translated to \"people of the deep\" in the common tongue, and whose use has been widely replaced by the more ubiquitous nomenclature, \"dwarves.\" I would like stated that I use the name \"dwarves\" in lieu of the more accurate term in these books out of sympathy for my readership, whom I can safely assume does not have the breadth of scholarship that 200 years of study has given me.\nWith that small point finished, let us begin our discussion on the dwarves by focusing on the indisputable artifacts they have left behind: their architectural and cultural designs. Unlike the more controversial areas of dwarven scholarship, the construction of dwarven cities and relics are well-founded due to the plethora of samples taken from the &lt;a href=\"Dwemer%20Ruins%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Ruin&lt;/a&gt; these peoples have left behind. My own home city, &lt;a href=\"Markarth%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Markarth&lt;/a&gt;, was originally one such ruin, and I can state from first-hand experience that all dwarven designs share a set of common principles that we can use to determine true artifacts from fakes and delineate patterns and methodologies that were important to their craftsmen.\nFirst of all, we can say for certain that dwarven artisans favored stone, at least as far as their buildings were concerned. This is no surprise. With notable exceptions, the vast majority of dwarven architecture is found underground or carved out of mountains. It is possible, although only theoretically, that the dwarves first mastered masonry as a race quite early, and later examples of metalwork were added on to much earlier stone designs as the dwarves began to master more complex tools. Regardless, the foundation of all known dwarven ruins is built on stonework, and the structure of dwarven stonework is sharp, angular and intensely mathematical in nature.\nBy a simple count, there are hundreds if not thousands of samples of dwarven buildings made of precise square shapes, and far fewer examples of discretely rounded or curved stonework, leading us to believe that early dwarves favored trusted, well-calculated designs based on angled lines rather than riskier, more imprecise calculations based on arcs and curves. This comparatively simple tradition of stonecutting has nevertheless resulted in buildings that are as structurally sound today as they were hundreds of years ago, making the works of our most skilled masons today seem like child's play in comparison.\nMetalwork as far as we know is the primary method used to make almost all dwarven crafts. We cannot, however, discount more easily destructible materials such as clay, paper, and glass from outside the scope of dwarven craftsmanship, but given the tendency of dwarven design to favor the long-lasting over the fragile, we can safely assume that at the very least metal was a heavy preference. And the metal used in all so-far-discovered dwarven relics is entirely unique to their culture.\nNo other race has replicated whatever process was used to create dwarven metal. Although it can be easily mistaken for bronze - and in fact many forgers of dwarven materials use bronze to create their fake replicas - it is most definitely a distinct type of metal of its own. I have personally seen metallurgists attempt to combine several different types of steel and common and rare ores in order to imitate dwarven metal's exclusive properties, but the only method that has been successful is to melt down existing dwarven metallic scraps and start over from there.\nDwarves, v2.\nIn our previous discussion on the dwarves (or \"&lt;a href=\"Dwemer\"&gt;Dwemer&lt;/a&gt;\" in the more correct, scholarly terminology), we looked into the properties of dwarven architecture and metallic craft. In this continuing discussion of &lt;a href=\"Tamriel\"&gt;Tamriel&lt;/a&gt;'s Lost Race, we shall examine the ways in which dwarves waged war and kept out trespassers. Unlike many other cultures still existing today, the dwarves built and relied on increasingly complicated machines for a wide variety of martial tasks, and weapons and armor created solely for the purpose of being wielded by dwarven warriors show remarkably fewer points of progress beyond the basic designs.\nLet us begin by analyzing those basic weapons and armors. Anyone who has held a dwarven axe or worn a &lt;a href=\"Dwarven%20Helmet%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;dwarven helmet&lt;/a&gt; can testify as to the ancient, ever-lasting quality of dwarven craftsmanship. Weapons do not deviate too greatly from their base function. &lt;a href=\"Dwarven%20Shortsword%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;Swords&lt;/a&gt; pierce through light armors with incredible effectiveness, owing primarily to the remarkable sharpness of tempered dwarven metal, and owing to a far lesser extent to its simple, double-edged design.\nCompare and contrast a sharp, angular &lt;a href=\"Dwarven%20Dagger%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;dwarven dagger&lt;/a&gt; to a curved &lt;a href=\"Mer\"&gt;elven&lt;/a&gt; blade, and it becomes a small logical leap to say that dwarven weaponsmiths relied almost exclusively on creating quality materials first, and merely allowed the form of those materials to flow from the method that weapon was intended to kill people.\nAs a culture that built almost exclusively underground, it's no surprise that dwarven armors are built to withstand incredibly heavy blows. Again, the fact that they are also resistant to being pierced by arrows or small blades is more of a testament to superior dwarven metallurgy over superior dwarven armorsmithing, but it would be erroneous to thus conclude that dwarven smiths did not take the manufacture of their weapons and armor very seriously. Every piece of war crafts I have examined show a remarkable amount of unnecessary detailing and personalization that is just as evident today among the most ardent blacksmiths.\nA dwarven smith probably came from a long tradition that distinguished itself in way that, say, the grip of a mace would feel, or the design of the head of individual arrows. Although, due to the paltry lack of any cultural artifacts outside the weapons and armors themselves, this is only mere speculation.\nThe last, but probably most important discussion in this volume, pertains to the existence of dwarven machinery. Dwarves created and manufactured on a very broad scale thousands of mechanical apparatuses of varying complexity. The most simple of which is the standard \"&lt;a href=\"Dwarven%20Spider%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;arachnid&lt;/a&gt;\" design used to ward off trespassers. We are so far uncertain as to how the dwarves were able to bring to life these remarkably intelligent machines, but I have witnessed one stalk a highly trained thief for several hours, only to ambush him as he was dealing with a lock to some room or treasure trove - I admit to have forgotten the details past the point at which it began spouting lightning at him.\nDwarven military machines also range from the human-sized \"&lt;a href=\"Dwarven%20Sphere%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Sphere&lt;/a&gt;\" warrior, which patrols the interiors of the ruins as a harmless ball only to emerge from it as a fully armed and armored automaton fighter, to the justly feared \"&lt;a href=\"Dwarven%20Centurion%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Centurion&lt;/a&gt;\" whose height ranges from twice to several hundred times human size depending on which reports you believe.\nDwarves, v3.\nIn this final volume on our discussion on the dwarves (again, see the term \"Dwemer\" for references using the more scholastic name), we will attempt an examination into the distinct culture and history of &lt;a href=\"Tamriel\"&gt;Tamriel&lt;/a&gt;'s Lost Race. We must, however, begin such a discussion with a warning. Despite what certain academic circles would like people to believe, there is so far no evidence that verifies any claim as to the dwarves' particular customs, morals, myths, legends, laws, systems of governance, or involvement in major historical events outside of those few examples that remain indisputable.\nFor instance, while we can say with absolute certainty that the disappearance of the entire dwarven race happened very suddenly, only the laziest of junior scholars would say that this event happened in the same day or even the same hour. There is simply no proof to dispute the theory that perhaps the dwarves disappeared from Tamriel gradually over the course of several years or indeed several decades.\nThere is also nothing that disproves the source of this disappearance as being attributable to mass deaths, plagues, magical contamination, experiments into the nature of &lt;a href=\"Aetherius\"&gt;Aetherius&lt;/a&gt; gone wrong, or even race-wide teleportation into one of the planes of &lt;a href=\"Oblivion%20%28Realm%29\"&gt;Oblivion&lt;/a&gt;. There is simply too little that the dwarves left behind that point to the nature of their great vanishing act, and this same frustration applies to all aspects of their social structure and history.\nWhat we know then can only be inferred by the writings of the other races which made contact with the dwarves before they left Tamriel. The dark elves (\"&lt;a href=\"Dunmer\"&gt;Dunmer&lt;/a&gt;\") for example teach that their great prophet &lt;a href=\"Nerevar\"&gt;Nerevar&lt;/a&gt; helped unite the dwarves and the elves in &lt;a href=\"Morrowind\"&gt;Morrowind&lt;/a&gt; against occupying &lt;a href=\"Nord\"&gt;Nord&lt;/a&gt; armies from Skyrim in the First Era, but Nord and &lt;a href=\"Orsimer\"&gt;Orc&lt;/a&gt; writings also indicate that dwarves were also allied with them at various points and in various legendary battles of theirs.\nUnfortunately, none of these legends and folk lore make an effort to describe the dwarves in great detail, only that they were a secretive people and that an alliance with them was unusual enough to warrant crafting a story around. And past the First Era, no race makes note of encountering any living dwarves at all. This is further confounded by the fact that so many of the dark elven writings on their relationship with the dwarves were lost during the tragic eruptions of &lt;a href=\"Vvardenfell\"&gt;Vvardenfell&lt;/a&gt; during the &lt;a href=\"Oblivion%20Crisis\"&gt;Oblivion Crisis&lt;/a&gt; nearly 200 years ago. What secrets they could have revealed about the Lost Race are now buried behind layers of molten earth along with so many unfortunate dark elven people.\nThus, we conclude our discussion on the dwarves on a somber note. As with all scholarly endeavors, we are left with more questions that we have answers, and the proof we so desperately search for is so often out of reach, denied even to the most fervent effort.\nThe mysteries the dwarves have left us with could easily warrant another century or so worth of personal examination from me, and quite possibly even several millennia of excavation of even on dwarven ruin would be insufficient to paint a complete picture on them. But what we can see from our threadbare tapestry of dwarven artifacts is a careful, intelligent, industrious, and highly advanced culture whose secrets we as students and teachers of their works can only hope to uncover someday."}

The proper term to use when referencing the ancient lost race of &lt;a href=\"Tamriel\"&gt;Tamriel&lt;/a&gt; is \"&lt;a href=\"Dwemer\"&gt;Dwemer&lt;/a&gt;.\" It is a word whose meaning is roughly translated to \"people of the deep\" in the &lt;a href=\"Tamrielic\"&gt;common tongue&lt;/a&gt;, and whose use has been widely replaced by the more ubiquitous nomenclature, \"dwarves.\" I would like stated that I use the name \"dwarves\" in lieu of the more accurate term in these books out of sympathy for my readership, whom I can safely assume does not have the breadth of scholarship that 200 years of study has given me.\nWith that small point finished, let us begin our discussion on the dwarves by focusing on the indisputable artifacts they have left behind: their architectural and cultural designs. Unlike the more controversial areas of dwarven scholarship, the construction of dwarven cities and relics are well-founded due to the plethora of samples taken from the &lt;a href=\"Dwemer%20Ruins%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Ruin&lt;/a&gt; these peoples have left behind. My own home city, &lt;a href=\"Markarth%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Markarth&lt;/a&gt;, was originally one such ruin, and I can state from first-hand experience that all dwarven designs share a set of common principles that we can use to determine true artifacts from fakes and delineate patterns and methodologies that were important to their craftsmen.\nFirst of all, we can say for certain that dwarven artisans favored stone, at least as far as their buildings were concerned. This is no surprise. With notable exceptions, the vast majority of dwarven architecture is found underground or carved out of mountains. It is possible, although only theoretically, that the dwarves first mastered masonry as a race quite early, and later examples of metalwork were added on to much earlier stone designs as the dwarves began to master more complex tools. Regardless, the foundation of all known dwarven ruins is built on stonework, and the structure of dwarven stonework is sharp, angular and intensely mathematical in nature.\nBy a simple count, there are hundreds if not thousands of samples of dwarven buildings made of precise square shapes, and far fewer examples of discretely rounded or curved stonework, leading us to believe that early dwarves favored trusted, well-calculated designs based on angled lines rather than riskier, more imprecise calculations based on arcs and curves. This comparatively simple tradition of stonecutting has nevertheless resulted in buildings that are as structurally sound today as they were hundreds of years ago, making the works of our most skilled masons today seem like child's play in comparison.\nMetalwork as far as we know is the primary method used to make almost all dwarven crafts. We cannot, however, discount more easily destructible materials such as clay, paper, and glass from outside the scope of dwarven craftsmanship, but given the tendency of dwarven design to favor the long-lasting over the fragile, we can safely assume that at the very least metal was a heavy preference. And the metal used in all so-far-discovered dwarven relics is entirely unique to their culture.\nNo other race has replicated whatever process was used to create dwarven metal. Although it can be easily mistaken for bronze - and in fact many forgers of dwarven materials use bronze to create their fake replicas - it is most definitely a distinct type of metal of its own. I have personally seen metallurgists attempt to combine several different types of steel and common and rare ores in order to imitate dwarven metal's exclusive properties, but the only method that has been successful is to melt down existing dwarven metallic scraps and start over from there."}

In this continuing discussion of &lt;a href=\"Tamriel\"&gt;Tamriel&lt;/a&gt;'s Lost Race, we shall examine the ways in which dwarves waged war and kept out trespassers. Unlike many other cultures still existing today, the dwarves built and relied on increasingly complicated machines for a wide variety of martial tasks, and weapons and armor created solely for the purpose of being wielded by dwarven warriors show remarkably fewer points of progress beyond the basic designs.\nLet us begin by analyzing those basic weapons and armors. Anyone who has held a dwarven axe or worn a &lt;a href=\"Dwarven%20Helmet%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;dwarven helmet&lt;/a&gt; can testify as to the ancient, ever-lasting quality of dwarven craftsmanship. Weapons do not deviate too greatly from their base function. &lt;a href=\"Dwarven%20Shortsword%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;Swords&lt;/a&gt; pierce through light armors with incredible effectiveness, owing primarily to the remarkable sharpness of tempered dwarven metal, and owing to a far lesser extent to its simple, double-edged design.\nCompare and contrast a sharp, angular &lt;a href=\"Dwarven%20Dagger%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;dwarven dagger&lt;/a&gt; to a curved &lt;a href=\"Mer\"&gt;elven&lt;/a&gt; blade, and it becomes a small logical leap to say that dwarven weaponsmiths relied almost exclusively on creating quality materials first, and merely allowed the form of those materials to flow from the method that weapon was intended to kill people.\nAs a culture that built almost exclusively underground, it's no surprise that dwarven armors are built to withstand incredibly heavy blows. Again, the fact that they are also resistant to being pierced by arrows or small blades is more of a testament to superior dwarven metallurgy over superior dwarven armorsmithing, but it would be erroneous to thus conclude that dwarven smiths did not take the manufacture of their weapons and armor very seriously. Every piece of war crafts I have examined show a remarkable amount of unnecessary detailing and personalization that is just as evident today among the most ardent blacksmiths.\nA dwarven smith probably came from a long tradition that distinguished itself in way that, say, the grip of a mace would feel, or the design of the head of individual arrows. Although, due to the paltry lack of any cultural artifacts outside the weapons and armors themselves, this is only mere speculation.\nThe last, but probably most important discussion in this volume, pertains to the existence of dwarven machinery. Dwarves created and manufactured on a very broad scale thousands of mechanical apparatuses of varying complexity. The most simple of which is the standard \"&lt;a href=\"Dwarven%20Spider%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;arachnid&lt;/a&gt;\" design used to ward off trespassers. We are so far uncertain as to how the dwarves were able to bring to life these remarkably intelligent machines, but I have witnessed one stalk a highly trained thief for several hours, only to ambush him as he was dealing with a lock to some room or treasure trove - I admit to have forgotten the details past the point at which it began spouting lightning at him.\nDwarven military machines also range from the human-sized \"&lt;a href=\"Dwarven%20Sphere%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Sphere&lt;/a&gt;\" warrior, which patrols the interiors of the ruins as a harmless ball only to emerge from it as a fully armed and armored automaton fighter, to the justly feared \"&lt;a href=\"Dwarven%20Centurion%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Centurion&lt;/a&gt;\" whose height ranges from twice to several hundred times human size depending on which reports you believe."}

They are well known for their skill and revolutionary developments in technology, engineering, crafting methods, metalwork, stonework, architecture, city-planning, science, mathematics, &lt;a href=\"magic\"&gt;magic&lt;/a&gt;, and the academic arts.\nThe Dwemer are known for being the subjects of one of the greatest mysteries in all of &lt;a href=\"Tamriel\"&gt;Tamriel&lt;/a&gt;. In &lt;a href=\"1E%20700\"&gt;1E 700&lt;/a&gt;, during the &lt;a href=\"Battle%20of%20Red%20Mountain\"&gt;Battle of Red Mountain&lt;/a&gt;, for reasons still debated and under circumstances still under investigation, the Dwemer seemingly disappeared. It is still being debated who or what caused the Dwemer to disappear, as well as whether they disappeared all at once or over a long period of time.\nPhysical appearance.\nEssays, stories, legends, and tales have generally described the appearance and personality of the Dwemer race in general, but not of individuals. In appearance, the Dwemer were believed to be sized similarly to the average elf or human, though occasionally likened to large children with beards. Other supporting evidence includes visual sculptures and &lt;a href=\"Dwarven%20Spectre\"&gt;Dwarven Spectre&lt;/a&gt;s that roam the halls within their &lt;a href=\"Dwemer%20Ruins\"&gt;ruined dwellings&lt;/a&gt;, which indicate that the Dwemer preferred heavy metal armors and robes, most of which are made out of either armored shells of ancient mechanical men or mismatched pieces from various devices.\nAs the Dwemer were a race of Mer, their blood was closely related to that of the other Mer races. In the Fourth Era, when the &lt;a href=\"Last%20Dragonborn\"&gt;Last Dragonborn&lt;/a&gt; helped Septimus Signus in a quest to open a Dwemer lockbox using Dwemer blood, Septimus Signus revealed that the blood of five Mer races could be collected and mixed by using an &lt;a href=\"Essence%20Extractor\"&gt;Essence Extractor&lt;/a&gt; to produce a close enough approximation to open the lockbox. Similarly to the members of the &lt;a href=\"Psijic%20Order\"&gt;Psijic Order&lt;/a&gt;, the Dwemer race also possessed the ability known as \"The Calling,\" to telepathically communicate with each other.\nHistory.\nLittle is known of the history of the Dwemer and the origins of their civilization. Conflicts with other races were frequent, as was infighting. As such, the timeline is not entirely accurate for many of these events.\nRecorded history dates the beginning of the Dwemer to the &lt;a href=\"Merethic%20Era\"&gt;Merethic Era&lt;/a&gt;, though it could be said that the earliest known history of the Dwemer was when the &lt;a href=\"Aedra\"&gt;Aedra&lt;/a&gt; created &lt;a href=\"Mundus\"&gt;Mundus&lt;/a&gt;, the mortal realm, and with it, all of the mortal races.\n&lt;a href=\"Dawn%20Era\"&gt;Dawn Era&lt;/a&gt;.\nDuring the Dawn Era, &lt;a href=\"Lorkhan\"&gt;Lorkhan&lt;/a&gt; convinced some of the &lt;a href=\"Et%27Ada\"&gt;Et'Ada&lt;/a&gt; to create a mortal realm, which would be called Mundus. As Mundus was forming, it was revealed that many of the Et'Ada would be forced to give up much of their power. Due to this, the Et'Ada met at the &lt;a href=\"Adamantine%20Tower\"&gt;Adamantine Tower&lt;/a&gt; during an event known as the &lt;a href=\"Convention\"&gt;Convention&lt;/a&gt;, and ultimately decided that Lorkhan had to be punished for his trickery, which was eventually carried out. With the creation of Mundus, some of the Et'Ada went to Nirn to live there. &lt;a href=\"Magnus\"&gt;Magnus&lt;/a&gt; tore a hole into &lt;a href=\"Aetherius\"&gt;Aetherius&lt;/a&gt;, which became Nirn's sun. Many other Et'Ada followed and became the &lt;a href=\"Magna%20Ge\"&gt;Magna Ge&lt;/a&gt;, tearing smaller holes into Aetherius, which became the stars.\nThe Aedra who walked on Mundus, specifically Nirn, created the &lt;a href=\"Ehlnofey\"&gt;Ehlnofey&lt;/a&gt;. The Ehlnofey of Tamriel became the Mer, and many different races of Mer came about. The Dwemer were one of the descendants of the Ehlnofey.\nAt some time after their creation, the &lt;a href=\"Tonal%20Architect\"&gt;Tonal Architect&lt;/a&gt;s started to research the divine powers of the Ehlnofey, or the Earth Bones. The Dwemer were devising a plan to attempt to re-create the divine power of immortality. Most of the Dwemer wished to ascend to the same level of divine power that the Gods had, including the capability of being immortal.\n&lt;a href=\"Merethic%20Era\"&gt;Merethic Era&lt;/a&gt;.\nBy the Late Middle Merethic Era, the Dwemer had established themselves on Morrowind and within the &lt;a href=\"Velothi%20Mountains\"&gt;Velothi Mountains&lt;/a&gt;, a Mountain range located between Morrowind and Skyrim. The Chimer had established themselves on Morrowind, then known as Resdayn. The two civilizations had very different societies and cultures. These differences, as well as disputes over territory and resources, caused conflicts between the two civilizations.\nThe earliest Dwemer Freehold colonies date from the Late Merethic Era.\n&lt;a href=\"First%20Era\"&gt;First Era&lt;/a&gt;.\n&lt;a href=\"Aetherium%20Wars\"&gt;Aetherium Wars&lt;/a&gt;.\nSometime after &lt;a href=\"1E%20221\"&gt;1E 221&lt;/a&gt;, the Dwemer discovered a new raw mineral while mining in FahlZhardum Din, more commonly known as &lt;a href=\"Blackreach\"&gt;Blackreach&lt;/a&gt;. They named this new mineral &lt;a href=\"Aetherium\"&gt;Aetherium&lt;/a&gt;. An alliance was formed between Blackreach, &lt;a href=\"Arkngthamz\"&gt;Arkngthamz&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Raldbthar\"&gt;Raldbthar&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Mzulft\"&gt;Mzulft&lt;/a&gt;, and Bthar-zel, now known as &lt;a href=\"Deep%20Folk%20Crossing\"&gt;Deep Folk Crossing&lt;/a&gt;. The responsibilities of this project were spread between the cities; Arkngthamz served as the main command center and the primary research facility, while Raldbthar, which was the primary source of Aetherium, was given the role of dealing with mining operations. Mzulft was used as a storage site, and it is unknown what role Bthar-zel was assigned. The &lt;a href=\"Aetherium%20Forge\"&gt;Aetherium Forge&lt;/a&gt; was constructed deep beneath the city of &lt;a href=\"Ruins%20of%20Bthalft\"&gt;Bthalft&lt;/a&gt;, where the Aetherial artifacts would be constructed under precisely controlled conditions.\nIn a short amount of time, each of the four city-states that were a part of the project eventually attempted to take control of the forge themselves, which evidently led to a civil war erupting at the core of the Dwemer civilization, known as the &lt;a href=\"Aetherium%20Wars\"&gt;Aetherium Wars&lt;/a&gt;. Decades passed as the war raged throughout Skyrim, and over time the war had begun to weaken the Dwemer city-states in Skyrim and was enough to cripple their empire. Eventually, &lt;a href=\"High%20King\"&gt;High King&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Gellir\"&gt;Gellir&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"Skyrim\"&gt;Skyrim&lt;/a&gt; decided that it was time to crush the weakened Dwemer city-states and led his armies across Skyrim in a campaign of rapid dominance. He and his armies spread across Skyrim, conquering the land and taking over many Dwemer cities in only three years.\nA century later, around &lt;a href=\"1E%20324\"&gt;1E 324&lt;/a&gt;, the Dwemer regained their foothold in Skyrim, and would eventually reclaim and reunite most of the cities and territory they had previously lost during the war. With no evidence to support otherwise, it is assumed that the project itself was abandoned, the risks being far too great.\n&lt;a href=\"War%20of%20the%20Crag\"&gt;War of the Crag&lt;/a&gt;.\nDuring the &lt;a href=\"War%20of%20the%20Crag\"&gt;War of the Crag&lt;/a&gt; in the early &lt;a href=\"First%20Era\"&gt;First Era&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"Snow%20Elves\"&gt;Snow Elves&lt;/a&gt;, cousins to the Dwemer, were being beaten by the &lt;a href=\"Atmorans\"&gt;Atmorans&lt;/a&gt;, who had by that time launched a war against them after the &lt;a href=\"Night%20of%20Tears\"&gt;Night of Tears&lt;/a&gt;. The &lt;a href=\"Battle%20of%20the%20Moesring\"&gt;Battle of the Moesring&lt;/a&gt; was the turning point for the Nords during that war, who began to achieve more victories against them. The remaining Snow Elves were forced into hiding, many seeking help and refuge among the Dwemer. The Dwemer would agree to their request, but only if the Snow Elves complied in consuming a toxic fungus. Eventually, the Dwemer betrayed and enslaved the Snow Elves, indirectly causing the devolution of the Falmer over many decades. However, at some point, the Falmer rose up against the Dwemer in revolt, resulting in the \"War of the Crag,\" which ended when the entire Dwemer race mysteriously vanished.\nThe founding of the &lt;a href=\"First%20Council\"&gt;First Council&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Skyrim%20Conquests\"&gt;Skyrim Conquests&lt;/a&gt;.\nThere was constant feuding and conflict between the &lt;a href=\"Chimer\"&gt;Chimer&lt;/a&gt; and Dwemer, mostly over issues of religion, magic and enchantment practices, and other cultural differences. This continued until the creation of the &lt;a href=\"First%20Council\"&gt;First Council&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"1E%20416\"&gt;1E 416&lt;/a&gt;. The First Council was the \"first pan-Dunmer governing body,\" and was created when the Dwemer and Chimer united to expel the &lt;a href=\"Nords\"&gt;Nords&lt;/a&gt; from Morrowind. However, the &lt;a href=\"Rourken%20Clan\"&gt;Rourken Clan&lt;/a&gt; refused to make peace with the Chimer. Their patriarch instead threw his ceremonial warhammer, &lt;a href=\"Volendrung\"&gt;Volendrung&lt;/a&gt;, across Tamriel, proclaiming that his clan would settle where it landed. They eventually settled in modern-day &lt;a href=\"Hammerfell\"&gt;Hammerfell&lt;/a&gt;, later the home of the &lt;a href=\"Redguards\"&gt;Redguards&lt;/a&gt;. On the journey to modern-day Hammerfell, they encountered a powerful mage known as &lt;a href=\"Shalidor\"&gt;Shalidor&lt;/a&gt;, who fought against them. This would come to be known as the &lt;a href=\"Battle%20of%20Rourken-Shalidor\"&gt;Battle of Rourken-Shalidor&lt;/a&gt;. King Rourken was said to have used his shield, &lt;a href=\"Spell%20Breaker\"&gt;Spell Breaker&lt;/a&gt;, during the battle.\nThe First Council was hugely successful, and both civilizations benefited from the alliance. The combined military strength of the Chimer and the Dwemer successfully removed the Nords from Morrowind. The Chimer and Dwemer armies annihilated the Nordic forces, leaving them \"humbled\" as they left Morrowind.\n&lt;a href=\"War%20of%20the%20First%20Council\"&gt;War of the First Council&lt;/a&gt;.\nAt an unknown time, Dwemer miners discovered a powerful artifact deep beneath Red Mountain. Kagrenac, Chief Tonal Architect and High Priest of the Dwemer, identified the artifact as the &lt;a href=\"Heart%20of%20Lorkhan\"&gt;Heart of Lorkhan&lt;/a&gt;. He forged three artifacts, &lt;a href=\"Keening\"&gt;Keening&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Sunder\"&gt;Sunder&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Wraithguard\"&gt;Wraithguard&lt;/a&gt;, to allow him and the other Tonal Architects to tap into the Heart of the Lorkhan and use it to power the &lt;a href=\"Numidium\"&gt;Numidium&lt;/a&gt;, a massive artificial god. News of the Dwemer plan reached the Chimer &lt;a href=\"Great%20House\"&gt;Great House&lt;/a&gt;s of Morrowind. The leaders of the Great Houses were baffled and called for war against the Dwemer. &lt;a href=\"Nerevar\"&gt;Nerevar&lt;/a&gt; rallied the Great Houses and prepared their armies for war. In &lt;a href=\"1E%20668\"&gt;1E 668&lt;/a&gt;, the War of the First Council erupted. When the First Council collapsed, the alliance between the Chimer and the Dwemer shut down.\n&lt;a href=\"Battle%20of%20Red%20Mountain\"&gt;Battle of Red Mountain&lt;/a&gt;.\nAccording to legend, after &lt;a href=\"Lorkhan\"&gt;Lorkhan&lt;/a&gt; tricked or convinced the &lt;a href=\"Aedra\"&gt;Aedra&lt;/a&gt; to create the mortal realm, they tore out his divine heart and threw it down to &lt;a href=\"Nirn\"&gt;Nirn&lt;/a&gt;, to be hidden forever. Tensions had begun to flare between the Chimer and Dwemer once again when &lt;a href=\"Kagrenac\"&gt;Kagrenac&lt;/a&gt;\u2014the Chief Tonal Architect of the Dwemer\u2014prompted the discovery of a mythological artifact known as the &lt;a href=\"Heart%20of%20Lorkhan\"&gt;Heart of Lorkhan&lt;/a&gt;, deep within the mountain. When the Chimer heard of this, they believed the Dwemer were mocking their cultural beliefs; as a result, the second &lt;a href=\"Battle%20of%20Red%20Mountain\"&gt;Battle of Red Mountain&lt;/a&gt; erupted in &lt;a href=\"1E%20700\"&gt;1E 700&lt;/a&gt;. Kagrenac devised a set of tools, &lt;a href=\"Sunder\"&gt;Sunder&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Keening\"&gt;Keening&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Wraithguard\"&gt;Wraithguard&lt;/a&gt;, to manipulate the Heart to instill divinity in his people, in order to make them immortal. However, the spell seems to have backfired, causing all known Dwemer to vanish in a manner similar to a &lt;a href=\"Dragon%20Break\"&gt;Dragon Break&lt;/a&gt;.\nAftermath.\nSince &lt;a href=\"1E%20700\"&gt;1E 700&lt;/a&gt;, no word has been heard of the Dwemer, with the notable exception of Yagrum Bagarn, who resided in the &lt;a href=\"Corprusarium\"&gt;Corprusarium&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"Tel%20Fyr%20%28Morrowind%29\"&gt;Tel Fyr&lt;/a&gt;. Apparently, he was absent from the Mortal Plane at the time of the disappearance, visiting an alternate dimension. His three thousand years of exploration and five hundred years of investigation have yielded no indication of the presence of his people on Mundus or any other plane of existence currently known.\n&lt;a href=\"Second%20Era\"&gt;Second Era&lt;/a&gt;.\nDuring &lt;a href=\"Tiber%20Septim\"&gt;Tiber Septim&lt;/a&gt;'s conquest in &lt;a href=\"2E%20864\"&gt;2E 864&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"Emperor\"&gt;Emperor&lt;/a&gt; took an interest in Dwemer artifacts. In an attempt to understand the inner workings of the remains of the race's work, Septim ordered &lt;a href=\"Amiel%20Richton\"&gt;Amiel Richton&lt;/a&gt; to commence research on the Dwemer machinery at &lt;a href=\"Stros%20M%27kai\"&gt;Stros M'kai&lt;/a&gt;. Richton appointed &lt;a href=\"Erasmo\"&gt;Erasmo&lt;/a&gt;, an elderly Bosmer, to research the observatory and animatronics within.\nWhen Richton attempted to escape the island from the &lt;a href=\"Restless%20League\"&gt;Restless League&lt;/a&gt; uprising, he used a working &lt;a href=\"Airships\"&gt;Dwemer airship&lt;/a&gt; to fly off. However, &lt;a href=\"Cyrus%20%28Redguard%29\"&gt;Cyrus&lt;/a&gt; managed to climb onto the airship and destroyed it, cutting the fragile cloth keeping it afloat. During this time, some people were convinced that the secrets of the Dwemer would soon be mastered and that their technology would be integrated into modern day use. Predictions included inventions of personal flying machines and new steam-powered appliances.\n&lt;a href=\"Third%20Era\"&gt;Third Era&lt;/a&gt;.\nIn &lt;a href=\"3E%20427\"&gt;3E 427&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"Nerevarine\"&gt;Nerevarine&lt;/a&gt; met with &lt;a href=\"Yagrum%20Bagarn\"&gt;Yagrum Bagarn&lt;/a&gt;, the last known living Dwemer. Bagarn was visiting an Outer Realm during the activation of the Numidium and had contracted &lt;a href=\"Corprus\"&gt;Corprus&lt;/a&gt; years later, which caused his body to deform and bloat. During this time, &lt;a href=\"Dagoth%20Ur%20%28Character%29\"&gt;Dagoth Ur&lt;/a&gt; had his plan set in motion for the future of Morrowind and Vvardenfell and began his work on the &lt;a href=\"Akulakhan\"&gt;Akulakhan&lt;/a&gt;, the second Numidium.\nThe Nerevarine also managed to obtain all three of Kagrenac's tools: Keening, Sunder, and Wraithguard. They used these tools to destroy the Heart of Lorkhan. This stopped Dagoth Ur's plans, killing him in the process, and destroyed the Akulakhan as well.\nSoon after, the Nerevarine was tasked with reforging Indoril Nerevar's sword, &lt;a href=\"Trueflame%20%28Tribunal%29\"&gt;Trueflame&lt;/a&gt;. After finding all the pieces, they sought the help of &lt;a href=\"Radac%20Stungnthumz\"&gt;Radac Stungnthumz&lt;/a&gt;, a Dwemer ghost. Radac enchanted and modified Trueflame for the Nerevarine.\n&lt;a href=\"Fourth%20Era\"&gt;Fourth Era&lt;/a&gt;.\nIn &lt;a href=\"4E%20201\"&gt;4E 201&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Arniel%20Gane\"&gt;Arniel Gane&lt;/a&gt;, a &lt;a href=\"Mage%20%28Class%29\"&gt;mage&lt;/a&gt; of the &lt;a href=\"College%20of%20Winterhold%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;College of Winterhold&lt;/a&gt;, was working on a project to reenact a scenario of Kagrenac's workings on the &lt;a href=\"Heart%20of%20Lorkhan\"&gt;Heart of Lorkhan&lt;/a&gt; by using &lt;a href=\"Keening\"&gt;Keening&lt;/a&gt; on a &lt;a href=\"Warped%20Soul%20Gem\"&gt;Warped Soul Gem&lt;/a&gt;. With the help of the &lt;a href=\"Last%20Dragonborn\"&gt;Dragonborn&lt;/a&gt;, who was unaware of his intentions, Arniel collected the necessary ten &lt;a href=\"Dwemer%20Cog\"&gt;Dwemer Cog&lt;/a&gt;s. Next, Arniel requested that the Dragonborn talk to &lt;a href=\"Enthir\"&gt;Enthir&lt;/a&gt; about finding a warped soul gem. After a discussion with Enthir, the Dragonborn went in search of the &lt;a href=\"Staff%20of%20Tandil\"&gt;Staff of Tandil&lt;/a&gt;, returning it to Enthir as payment for the warped soul gem. The next phase of the project involved a Dwemer Convector. Since Arniel's own model had been destroyed, he sent the Dragonborn to find a &lt;a href=\"Dwemer%20Convector\"&gt;Dwemer Convector&lt;/a&gt; to heat up the warped soul gem, using a &lt;a href=\"Arniel%27s%20Convection\"&gt;novice destruction spell created by Arniel&lt;/a&gt;. The Dragonborn heated the warped soul gem at a Dwemer Convector site and returned it to Arniel.\nWhen sent to inquire of Enthir as to the whereabouts of a package, the Dragonborn was advised to search for the courier, and directed to the location of the package. The Dragonborn returned to Arniel with the package, which contained a unique dagger. Arniel then explained the project to the Dragonborn: he was going to use Keening on the warped soul gem to recreate the scenario in which Kagrenac tapped into the Heart of Lorkhan. As Arniel was using Keening on the warped soul gem, he disappeared instantly; this strengthens the much-disputed theory that the Dwemer race disappeared instantly.\nSome time during the &lt;a href=\"Fourth%20Era\"&gt;Fourth Era&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Taron%20Dreth\"&gt;Taron Dreth&lt;/a&gt; published a book called \"&lt;a href=\"The%20Aetherium%20Wars\"&gt;The Aetherium Wars&lt;/a&gt;\". Searching for the famed and legendary Aetherium Forge, he stole his former teacher &lt;a href=\"Katria\"&gt;Katria's&lt;/a&gt; research and published it under his own name. Katria took her remaining research and went to &lt;a href=\"Arkngthamz\"&gt;Arkngthamz&lt;/a&gt;, but was killed when an earthquake destroyed the ruin. Her ghost remained, however, and met with the Last Dragonborn, who helped her find the four &lt;a href=\"Aetherium%20Shard\"&gt;Aetherium Shard&lt;/a&gt;s and the Aetherium Forge deep within the &lt;a href=\"Ruins%20of%20Bthalft\"&gt;Ruins of Bthalft&lt;/a&gt;, unlocking the mystery of the Aetherium Forge itself.\nMany expeditions have been made to various &lt;a href=\"Dwemer%20Ruins\"&gt;Dwemer Ruins&lt;/a&gt; in Tamriel. During the Fourth Era, &lt;a href=\"the%20Synod\"&gt;the Synod&lt;/a&gt; made an expedition to &lt;a href=\"Mzulft%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Mzulft&lt;/a&gt; in Skyrim, where they researched and studied Dwemer technology, hoping to use the knowledge to consolidate Imperial political power. An expedition was made to &lt;a href=\"Avanchnzel\"&gt;Avanchnzel&lt;/a&gt; by four adventurers (&lt;a href=\"Watches-The-Roots\"&gt;Watches-The-Roots&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Drennen\"&gt;Drennen&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Breya\"&gt;Breya&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"From-Deepest-Fathoms\"&gt;From-Deepest-Fathoms&lt;/a&gt;), who were attempting to steal a Dwarven &lt;a href=\"Lexicon\"&gt;Lexicon&lt;/a&gt;.\nDuring the Fourth Era, &lt;a href=\"Sulla%20Trebatius\"&gt;Sulla Trebatius&lt;/a&gt; led an expedition to &lt;a href=\"Alftand\"&gt;Alftand&lt;/a&gt;, accompanied by &lt;a href=\"Umana\"&gt;Umana&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Endrast\"&gt;Endrast&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Valie\"&gt;Valie&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Yag%20gra-Gortwog\"&gt;Yag gra-Gortwog&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"J%27darr\"&gt;J'darr&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"J%27zhar\"&gt;J'zhar&lt;/a&gt;. When the group arrived at Alftand, they set up a small camp outside and a catwalk leading into the glacier. At some point, a storm came in and the group was forced to take refuge inside the ruined Dwemer city. Valie, Endrast, and Yag gra-Gortwog were taken captive by the &lt;a href=\"Falmer\"&gt;Falmer&lt;/a&gt;, who were living inside the ruin, while they were asleep. Valie was taken to the torture room and killed, while Endrast and Yag were taken into prison cells. Endrast and Yagak were able to escape using lockpicks, but the Falmer noticed their escape. Yagak attempted unsuccessfully to buy time for Endrast to get away, but both were killed during their escape.\nSociety.\nThe Dwemer were a free-thinking and reclusive &lt;a href=\"Mer\"&gt;Elven&lt;/a&gt; race who lived in &lt;a href=\"Tamriel\"&gt;Tamriel&lt;/a&gt;, mostly in &lt;a href=\"Morrowind\"&gt;Morrowind&lt;/a&gt; during the &lt;a href=\"Merethic%20Era\"&gt;Merethic Era&lt;/a&gt; and the First Era. They were, in general, a very advanced and powerful civilization. Dwemer society did not encourage the use of technology over magic, but the general view of their society was that magic was unimportant and pointless; so much so that most other races thought them \"mockers and profaners of the divine.\"\nThe Dwemer have been called an evil race, as according to many scholars, the Dwemer were feared by the &lt;a href=\"Dunmer\"&gt;Dunmer&lt;/a&gt;, Nords, and Redguards they encountered, or thought \"cruel.\" On the other hand, the Dwemer people have also been called a noble and honorable race, with legends that tell of their heroic deeds of honor and glory.\nFew written works have described the appearance, personality, or achievements of individual Dwemer; most knowledge of the Dwemer regards the race as a whole. In addition, it is unclear whether the Dwemer were a single united empire or a group of related clans.\nThe Dwemer seem to have revered the pursuits of logic and science, in contrast to other Mer races. An individual whose career was in philosophy, mathematics, science, metallurgy, or architecture would likely have been elevated to the highest, most respected, and most prestigious of positions in Dwemer society. Those who studied and reasoned would have reached a position that would have equaled \"clergy in a more mystically-inclined culture.\" This idea is supported by a fragment of &lt;a href=\"Dwemeris\"&gt;Dwemeris&lt;/a&gt; text recovered from &lt;a href=\"Irkngthand\"&gt;Irkngthand&lt;/a&gt; and translated by Dwemer scholar Thenwe Ghelein, who believes it to be associated with the &lt;a href=\"Rourken%20Clan\"&gt;Rourken Clan&lt;/a&gt;. While some scholars interpret those words as evidence to support that the Dwemer may have worshiped Mundus, Thelwe Ghelein hypothesizes that the Dwemeris quotes are related to society and civil matters.\nThere are several known ranks in Dwemer society, including High Priest, General, Lord, Councillor, and Protector. A major rank in Dwemer society was that of &lt;a href=\"Tonal%20Architect\"&gt;Tonal Architect&lt;/a&gt;, or Magecrafter. Usually crafters and mage-engineers, Tonal Architects specialized in magic technologies and devices, and were led in their studies by a Chief Tonal Architect.\nCulture.\nArchitecture.\nThe Dwemer empire existed throughout several parts of Tamriel; their cities were found throughout Morrowind, &lt;a href=\"High%20Rock\"&gt;High Rock&lt;/a&gt;, Hammerfell, and Skyrim. It was theorized that the Dwemer prominently lived in the &lt;a href=\"Vvardenfell\"&gt;Vvardenfell&lt;/a&gt; region of Morrowind, though it was also theorized that the Dwemer capital was Blackreach.\nPlace names.\nTheir cities were commonly referred to as strongholds, as well as Freehold colonies, and also city-states.\nFunctions.\nDwemer cities were vast and expansive, containing living spaces, dwellings, study rooms, areas for scientific, academic, engineering, and arcane study, animunculories and animuncultories (areas for the production of &lt;a href=\"Animunculi\"&gt;Automatons&lt;/a&gt;), workshops, pumping stations and pump-houses, and boileries. Other sections included aedromes and sky-domes (which contained Oculories), debate halls, war quarters, cathedrals, marketplaces, treasuries, armories, storage areas, storerooms, and gatehouses. These areas were interconnected with great halls and long passageways running throughout the Dwemer's underground cities. Some sections of Dwemer cities were sectioned and named for a specific role. The Arcanex was a section of a city used for arcane study, and observational studies have shown that the Arcanex in &lt;a href=\"Bthardamz\"&gt;Bthardamz&lt;/a&gt; contains a surprising collection of soul-gems, alchemical concoctions, and magical text. This evidence supports a possible theory that Dwemer scientists and engineers may have also invested some of their time in magical study. The Animonculory section of a city was the section used for the role of industrial production and producing Automatons. Although &lt;a href=\"Nchardak\"&gt;Nchardak&lt;/a&gt; did not contain an Animunculory, one of the city's main roles was to act as a major military production center, capable of constructing a single &lt;a href=\"Animunculi\"&gt;Animunculi&lt;/a&gt; within a day. &lt;a href=\"Orrery\"&gt;Orrery&lt;/a&gt; were elaborate, massive constructs designed for astronomical observation and study.\nPeople who were coming and going through the capital city known as Blackreach and the other cities connecting to Blackreach, which were &lt;a href=\"Alftand\"&gt;Alftand&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Raldbthar\"&gt;Raldbthar&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Mzinchaleft\"&gt;Mzinchaleft&lt;/a&gt;, used two devices, one simply known as a &lt;a href=\"Dwarven%20Mechanism\"&gt;Dwarven Mechanism&lt;/a&gt;, and an &lt;a href=\"Attunement%20Sphere\"&gt;Attunement Sphere&lt;/a&gt;, to open the entrance to Blackreach. These two devices were interconnected; they were used in conjunction to open the entrance to Blackreach. For outsiders, the first point of entry when heading to Blackreach had to be Alftand. After that, one could enter Blackreach through a number of other locations, including the cities Raldbthar and Mzinchaleft, as well as three \"Great Lifts,\" which included the &lt;a href=\"Great%20Lift%20at%20Alftand\"&gt;Great Lift at Alftand&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Great%20Lift%20at%20Raldbthar\"&gt;Great Lift at Raldbthar&lt;/a&gt;, and the &lt;a href=\"Great%20Lift%20at%20Mzinchaleft\"&gt;Great Lift at Mzinchaleft&lt;/a&gt;.\nInfrastructure.\nSince the Dwemer had a significant mastery over metalwork, construction of massive machines and interest in the sciences, notably astronomy, the Orrery were trademark developments of the Dwemer in their metalwork and scientific studies. One notable Orrery was located in &lt;a href=\"Stros%20M%27kai\"&gt;Stros M'kai&lt;/a&gt;, constructed by the &lt;a href=\"Rourken%20Clan\"&gt;Rourken Clan&lt;/a&gt; sometime during &lt;a href=\"1E%20420\"&gt;1E 420&lt;/a&gt;. The &lt;a href=\"Oculory\"&gt;Oculory&lt;/a&gt; was a massive construct located in &lt;a href=\"Mzulft\"&gt;Mzulft&lt;/a&gt; and inside the &lt;a href=\"Tower%20of%20Mzark\"&gt;Tower of Mzark&lt;/a&gt; in Blackreach. The Oculory were also trademark developments of the Dwemer. The Oculory in Mzulft was designed and built to collect starlight, then transmute it and split it. When calibrated correctly with a &lt;a href=\"Focusing%20Crystal\"&gt;Focusing Crystal&lt;/a&gt;, it can then be used to project this energy into a map of Tamriel, and can then harness the energies to reveal locations of great sources of magical power. The Focusing Crystal was yet another device created by the Dwemer to power the Oculory. The Dwemer scientists, mages, engineers, and &lt;a href=\"Tonal%20Architect\"&gt;Tonal Architect&lt;/a&gt;s who were working on this machine were attempting to steal the power of it. The Oculory located in the &lt;a href=\"Tower%20of%20Mzark\"&gt;Tower of Mzark&lt;/a&gt;, however, was designed and built to store artifacts of great importance, notably an &lt;a href=\"Elder%20Scroll%20%28Dragon%29\"&gt;Elder Scroll&lt;/a&gt;. Oculories were housed in aedromes, or sky-domes. According to &lt;a href=\"Paratus%20Decimius\"&gt;Paratus Decimius&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"Orrery\"&gt;Orrery&lt;/a&gt; at the &lt;a href=\"Arcane%20University\"&gt;Arcane University&lt;/a&gt; was the inspiration for the Oculory. The Dwemer did not actually refer to this machine as an Oculory, but rather another, unknown name.\nBuilding materials.\nIn comparison with the rest of the Dwemer's creations and constructions, their architecture was mainly composed of stone. On the other hand, their methods of stonework and architectural construction were just as unique and grand as their metalwork. Their civilization's cities contained structures that were built with stone that was designed and constructed as sharp, straight, angular forms that were based on angled lines, which were also intensely mathematical in nature. Architects favored \"trusted, well-calculated designs based on angled lines rather than riskier, more imprecise calculations based on arcs and curves.\" Dwemer architecture is unique in that they favored stone over other materials. Their mastery of stonework is a shining example of their civilization, and a notable one at that. As opposed to metal, which is found in their Animunculi, Dwarven artisans favored stone, at least as far as their buildings were concerned. However, as the Dwemer began to advance and achieve mastery over metalwork and more complex tools, metal was added to their architectural designs for buildings. Nevertheless, \"the foundation of all known Dwemer ruins is built on stonework, and the structure of dwarven stonework is sharp, angular and intensely mathematical in nature.\" As a direct result, the traditions and knowledge that Dwemer architects and city planners had has allowed Dwemer buildings to stay structurally sound long after their race disappeared.\nBuilding styles.\nThe technique of constructing, building, planning, and setting up cities was prevalent among all civilizations, like the Dwemer.\nNorthern clans may have had a unique feature to their cities called Deep Venues. Deep Venues were often characterized as being made up of one or more expansive natural caverns in which several other structures will occur. Structures built within the Venue may be carved from the stone itself, or freely built upon the cavern floor. The largest and most impressive Venue, seen by scholar Thelwe Ghelein, was in Bthardamz, which may have even featured roads wide enough for ten men to walk \u201cshoulder-meets-shoulder\u201d along it.\nAs Dwarven sites located west of Vvardenfell appeared to be built at a much greater depth than their Vvardenfell counterparts, it was theorized by Thelwe Ghelein that there was a specific threshold as to where Dwarven excavators and miners would dig before the construction of vital structures would begin. This threshold was referred to as \"the Geocline.\" The Geocline may have had nothing to do with the Deep Venue. However, there was some variations in the depth of a Deep Venue, while the Geocline was where the city begins to be seen. Tunnels, passageways, and chambers at more shallow depths closer to the surface, while quite grand in their design, build, and appearance, served little use in the civic purposes. Infrastructure such as surplus stores of food and supplies, warehouse chambers, trading posts, and barracks for topside patrols were common above the Geocline. These structures may have been built to meander in a more random pattern than the other structures beneath. It was hypothesized by scholar Thelwe Ghelein that this was due to the unpredictable nature of an excavation, even with the powerful magics and superior technology the Dwemer possessed. It was possible that these tunnels were the result of the search for more suitable substratum to build within.\nHoagen Keltorra was the name of a possible type of building style. Some scholars interpreted this term as the Dwemer philosophy and religion that focused on the worship of Mundus. Thelwe Ghelein hypothesized that a term\u2015Hoagen Keltorra was related to civic matters. She believes that the first part of a fragment of a text that mentions Hoagen Keltorra, found during an expedition to Irkngthand, is related to the Rourken Clan, and describes how a respected Dwemer, Cuolec, was promoted to a civic position, most likely Tonal Architect. The second fragment of the text suggested that Cuolec\u2019s position required him to build in a specific style. Thelwe Ghelein believed that Hoagen Keltorra was the name of a certain, specific style, or referred to a group of styles, differing in construction principles and typical structures.\nWith Dwemer architecture and infrastructure, there were four tests used by Dwemer architects in city planning and construction: The Test of Pattern required the observer to observe and analyze for patterns before planning. The Test of Disorder required the observer to proceed methodically when no pattern was observed. When the observer recognized that many tasks had to be accomplished in no specific order, the plan was to order all tasks to be completed, and they should be able to recall how, why and when the task was completed. The Test of Evasion had the observer to study an obstacle, and review their resources and abilities. If the obstacle was too difficult, then the observer had to find a way around the problem. The Test of Confrontation had the observer to inspect the obstacle and review their resources and abilities. If the obstacle was too difficult, then the observer had to look for a way around the obstacle, but if there was no possibility of going around the obstacle, then the issue had to be confronted directly.\nVariations of style.\nIt has been thoroughly researched and debated on the topic of variations of style among different groups, locations, and time periods of the Dwemer civilization. Like any civilization, the Dwemer culture could, and did, change over time and across lands and between people and groups of people.\nThe architecture of Dwemer cities and sites in &lt;a href=\"Vvardenfell\"&gt;Vvardenfell&lt;/a&gt; was noticeably different from other Dwemer sites throughout Morrowind, as well as the other zones of territory the Dwemer civilization was found. The actual construction of the sites and the internal structure of the ruins was also unique; the more significant locations of the city were found closer to the surface. In Dwemer ruins on the mainland, the more important parts of a city were found much deeper underground. These findings have led some scholars to believe that sites and cities outside of &lt;a href=\"Vvardenfell\"&gt;Vvardenfell&lt;/a&gt; and Morrowind were mere outposts, but some scholars state that differences between excavation and construction styles were because clan architects simply had their own styles and preferences when it came to civic planning. Some scholars state that in Dwemer society, techniques, and architectural design, development, and construction were based on empirical study, so room for creativity and openness was small. One theory that supports the last hypothesis is that geological makeup most likely played a significant role for Dwemer colonies who had just begun to excavate out a mountain where they had prepared to build a new city. It was tougher for Dwemer excavators of colonies excavating in northern &lt;a href=\"Skyrim\"&gt;Skyrim&lt;/a&gt;, where the lands were cold and windy and the ground was rocky and frozen solid, versus Dwemer excavators working in Vvardenfell, where the volcanic substratum was soft and easy to dig through, or the \"ubiquitous aquifers found in &lt;a href=\"Hammerfell\"&gt;Hammerfell&lt;/a&gt;.\" It is possible that Dwarven excavators in the northern areas were \"not even able to excavate larger structures until reaching more pliable stratum.\"\nNotable cities.\nThe Dwemer were excellent miners and predominant in that art, and excavated deep beneath the surface and deep into the mountains to build their cities. Most of their cities were located underground, with one exception being part of &lt;a href=\"Markarth\"&gt;Markarth&lt;/a&gt;. Markarth was a major city and the capital city of &lt;a href=\"the%20Reach\"&gt;the Reach&lt;/a&gt; after the Dwemer disappeared, as humans started to settle the city. When the Dwemer civilization still existed on Tamriel, the city was known as &lt;a href=\"Nchuand-Zel\"&gt;Nchuand-Zel&lt;/a&gt;. Part of the city was in the open air and jutted out from the crag in the mountain which the city was built upon. &lt;a href=\"Understone%20Keep\"&gt;Understone Keep&lt;/a&gt; was located towards the far end of the city near the mountainside, and within Understone Keep was where the government of the Reach resided. The city reached even deeper into and under the mountains, but nobody who came to settle Markarth after the Dwemer disappeared went to settle this section of the city. By the Fourth Era, Markarth was now the capital city of the Reach, and Nchuand-Zel, the underground section of the city, was still unsettled and with Animunculi and Falmer still around.\nLanguage.\nBoth the Dwemer's language and writing system is referred to as &lt;a href=\"Dwemeris\"&gt;Dwemeris&lt;/a&gt;; the language utilized many z's and d's in its form. The writing system was composed of and written as the Dwemer's own form of runes and glyphs, aesthetically similar to that of the &lt;a href=\"Daedric%20Alphabet\"&gt;Daedric Alphabet&lt;/a&gt;, yet it was heavily based on the &lt;a href=\"Aldmeri%20Language\"&gt;Aldmeri Language&lt;/a&gt;.\nSome forms of Dwemeris have been seen in the form of prefixes and suffixes of notable Dwemer names of various historical terms, such as \"Volen-,\" meaning \"hammer,\" and \"-Fell,\" meaning \"city,\" giving &lt;a href=\"Volenfell\"&gt;Volenfell&lt;/a&gt;; \"City of the &lt;a href=\"Volendrung\"&gt;Hammer&lt;/a&gt;.\" The warhammer &lt;a href=\"Volendrung\"&gt;Volendrung&lt;/a&gt; has had its name translated into \"Hammer of Might\" by Dwemer scholars and translators. The nation of Hammerfell attributed its name to the warhammer Volendrung, as Dwemer and Hammerfell lore-history held that the Chieftain of the &lt;a href=\"Rourken%20Clan\"&gt;Rourken Clan&lt;/a&gt; decided to move his people to a new location, so he threw that very warhammer from Morrowind and would move to wherever it ended up. This was at the site of the city of Volenfell in Hammerfell, hence the two locations' names. The name &lt;a href=\"Blackreach\"&gt;FalZhardum Din&lt;/a&gt;, based on observations of Dwemeris texts and inscriptions on tablets and walls in an unknown Dwemer city, has been revealed to be the Dwemer name for &lt;a href=\"Blackreach\"&gt;Blackreach&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe five books, \"&lt;a href=\"Divine%20Metaphysics\"&gt;Divine Metaphysics&lt;/a&gt;\", \"&lt;a href=\"The%20Egg%20of%20Time\"&gt;The Egg of Time&lt;/a&gt;\", \"&lt;a href=\"Hanging%20Gardens\"&gt;Hanging Gardens&lt;/a&gt;\", \"&lt;a href=\"Nchunak%27s%20Fire%20and%20Faith\"&gt;Nchunak's Fire and Faith&lt;/a&gt;\", and \"&lt;a href=\"Chronicles%20of%20Nchuleft\"&gt;Chronicles of Nchuleft&lt;/a&gt;\", were all possible to be translated by Dwemer scholars. \"Divine Metaphysics\" explained how the Dwemer created the &lt;a href=\"Numidium\"&gt;Numidium&lt;/a&gt; and used Kagrenac's Tools on the Heart of Lorkhan. \"The Egg of Time\" was written by Bthuand Mzahnch, who refuted the theories of Kagrenac. \"Hanging Gardens\" was a travel guide, \"Nchunak's Fire and Faith\" was the tale of Nchunak, and \"Chronicles of Nchuleft\" was a story detailing the assassination plot against a Dwemer conference in Nchuleft.\nPhilosophy and religion.\nThere is no known story behind the Dwemer's disassociation with the &lt;a href=\"Aldmer\"&gt;Aldmer&lt;/a&gt; and other &lt;a href=\"Mer\"&gt;Mer&lt;/a&gt; races, as their society contained very few similarities with the other Mer races, other than some political and legal principles, and aspects of their language and writing system. The Dwemer were also far different from any other race on &lt;a href=\"Tamriel\"&gt;Tamriel&lt;/a&gt;. Some scholars have stated that the Dwemer preferred the use of machines and tools to the use of magic, while there is some evidence to suggest that the Dwemer also used magic. Some non-scholarly sources suggest that \"the Dwarves didn't believe in magic\" at all.\nThe precise nature of Dwemer religion and worship is unknown, but one could name their religion \"negalithic refusatronic world-navel-gazinism.\" However, it is recorded that they scorned the &lt;a href=\"Daedra\"&gt;Daedra&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"Nine%20Divines\"&gt;Nine Divines&lt;/a&gt;, and essentially all of the gods, and attempted to defy them with their values of \"reason and logic.\" The Dwemer people apparently believed that their power rivaled the gods', a claim which many scholars agree may have led to their demise, some even going so far as to call them blasphemous. The Dwemer challenged the power and superiority of the &lt;a href=\"et%27Ada\"&gt;et'Ada&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"Aedra\"&gt;Aedra&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Daedra\"&gt;Daedra&lt;/a&gt;, questioned their authority, and traveled from &lt;a href=\"Mundus\"&gt;Mundus&lt;/a&gt; into the Outer Realms of &lt;a href=\"Aetherius\"&gt;Aetherius&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Oblivion%20%28Realm%29\"&gt;Oblivion&lt;/a&gt;. In their underground sanctuaries, the Dwemer studied powerful, magical relics and researched powers that they believed \"could rival the gods themselves.\" The Dwemer religion, if there was one at all, has been said to be one of the most complex and difficult puzzles of Dwemer culture.\nDuring the Dawn Era, the Dwemer attempted to reach the state of immortality up to the point of their disappearance. They researched the fall of the &lt;a href=\"Ehlnofey\"&gt;Earth Bones&lt;/a&gt; and were essentially trying to reverse the effects for themselves\u2014to create immortality from the deaths of the Earth Bones. The Dwemer were trying to defy the gods, while also attempting to recreate their powers. The book \"&lt;a href=\"Divine%20Metaphysics\"&gt;Divine Metaphysics&lt;/a&gt;\" explained how the Dwemer tried to forge a new god, Anumidium, using Kagrenac's Tools and the sacred tones on the Heart of Lorkhan. It was \"unfashionable among the Dwemer to view their spirits as synthetic constructs three, four, or forty creational gradients below the divine.\" The Dwemer were, however, not unified in their thinking; some opposed the research on the Ehlnofey/Earth Bones and the idea that the Dwemer race should be immortal. The ones who opposed this believed that \"using the power Lorkhan's Heart was an unjustifiable risk.\" Later, during the Battle of Red Mountain, Chief Tonal Architect Kagrenac made one last shot at succeeding in bringing immortality to his people, and in doing so, caused their entire people to disappear. It is unknown whether he succeeded or failed.\nThough the \"&lt;a href=\"Ancient%20Tales%20of%20the%20Dwemer\"&gt;Ancient Tales of the Dwemer&lt;/a&gt;\" book series is fictional and regarded by many scholars as mislabeling the Dwemer, the story \"&lt;a href=\"Azura%20and%20the%20Box\"&gt;Azura and the Box&lt;/a&gt;\" tells of a Dwemer scholar who did not believe in the gods and religion. In \"Azura and the Box\", Nchylbar met with his old friend Athynic. During their visit together, Nchylbar told Athynic that he intended to discover the nature of divine power. Athynic protested, but from the ties of a great friendship, he reluctantly agreed to help his friend. Athynic summoned &lt;a href=\"Azura\"&gt;Azura&lt;/a&gt;, and when Azura appeared, she spoke to him. Azura, Athynic, and Nchylbar discussed what might have been in the closed box that Athynics' students brought in. Azura said that there was a red-petaled flower in the box, but when Nchylbar opened the box, he revealed to everybody in the room that the box was empty. When Azura was about to leave, she made a look that only Athynic saw, and then she left. For Athynic, he could not speak and was trembling. That night, Nchylbar, who did not believe that the existence and power of the Gods was legitimate, was found dead.\nIt is possible that the Dwemer worshiped Mundus itself, theorized by some scholars from primary source text found by scholar and archaeologist Thelwe Ghelein in &lt;a href=\"Irkngthand\"&gt;Irkngthand&lt;/a&gt;. There were mixed ideas on the text; some scholars believed that the text supported the idea that the Dwemer worshiped Mundus, while Ghelein did not believe that the text supported the theory that the Dwemer worshiped Mundus, but rather that the text was related to civic and political matters.\nInnovations and crafting.\nTechnology.\nDwarves were known to have created\u2014and manufactured on a vast scale\u2014thousands of mechanical apparatuses of varying complexity, most of which were constructed within the city of &lt;a href=\"Nchardak\"&gt;Nchardak&lt;/a&gt;, a large military production center.. These constructs are referred to as &lt;a href=\"Animunculi\"&gt;Animunculi&lt;/a&gt;, or simply \"automatons,\" who were known to cause havoc when unleashed against enemies on the battlefield, completely obliterating enemy forces.. Several types were found within ancient Dwemer ruins, the most simple being that of an &lt;a href=\"Dwarven%20Spider\"&gt;arachnid&lt;/a&gt; designed to ward off trespassers. Most automatons contained a &lt;a href=\"Soul%20Gem\"&gt;soul gem&lt;/a&gt;, sometimes more than one. According to research done by famed scholar &lt;a href=\"Calcelmo\"&gt;Calcelmo&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Sulla%20Trebatius\"&gt;Sulla Trebatius&lt;/a&gt;, which were still theories, the soul gem(s) were believed to be what powered these machines. It may have also acted as a source of power for the boiler, due to the extreme energy held within it. In some automatons, such as the &lt;a href=\"Dwarven%20Spider%20Guardian\"&gt;Dwarven Spider Guardian&lt;/a&gt;, the soul gem(s) may have acted as a source of &lt;a href=\"Destruction\"&gt;Destruction&lt;/a&gt; magic, being able to attack intruders with lightning bolts. They appeared to allow the Spiders to function besides their internal steam power systems, electrical systems, and working gears and cogs.\nThe other types of Animunculi that were encountered included &lt;a href=\"Dwarven%20Ballista\"&gt;ballistas&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Dwarven%20Centurion\"&gt;centurions&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Dwarven%20Sphere\"&gt;spheres&lt;/a&gt;. They were capable of receiving, interpreting, and responding to the actions of people around them, due to the excellent work produced by Dwemer engineers. Animunculi were somehow linked to their place of origin, and would immediately lose power and shut down if removed from the vicinity. It was possible that animunculi were capable of reconstructing and repowering themselves to go back to protecting their former master's denizens.\nDwarven military equipment was effective and resilient to the effects of time. Their weapons were powerful and their armors strong. &lt;a href=\"Dwarven%20Sword\"&gt;Dwarven Sword&lt;/a&gt;s were effective at breaking through light armors; this was due to the venerability and sharpness of tempered Dwarven metal and owed less to the double-edged design. &lt;a href=\"Dwarven%20Armor\"&gt;Dwarven Armor&lt;/a&gt;s were capable of withstanding incredibly heavy blows and taking on the most powerful of arrows. This was due to the fact that the Dwarves were an empire, civilization, and culture built almost exclusively underground, so the Dwemer race itself was naturally accustomed to the aspects of living underground. Just like Dwarven swords and other weapons, the effectiveness of Dwarven armor was more of a testament to great metallurgy skills rather than armorsmithing skills. When a &lt;a href=\"Dwarven%20Dagger\"&gt;Dwarven Dagger&lt;/a&gt; was compared to an Elven dagger, it was clear that most Dwemer weaponsmiths relied almost exclusively on creating quality crafting materials first, and allowed the final forms of those materials to stem from the concept that the weapon was intended to kill people. Dwemer armies also experimented with the use of &lt;a href=\"Dwarven%20Crossbow\"&gt;crossbows&lt;/a&gt;. Though &lt;a href=\"Dwarven%20Bow%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;bows&lt;/a&gt; were additionally used, crossbows were technologically advanced. Various Dwemer engineers drew up several schematics for crossbows, including a standard and enhanced version. Schematics were also drawn up for explosive bolts to be used alongside the &lt;a href=\"Dwarven%20Bolt\"&gt;standard bolt&lt;/a&gt;, of which three known variants have been identified: an &lt;a href=\"Exploding%20Dwarven%20Bolt%20of%20Fire\"&gt;exploding fire bolt&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Exploding%20Dwarven%20Bolt%20of%20Ice\"&gt;exploding ice bolt&lt;/a&gt;, and an &lt;a href=\"Exploding%20Dwarven%20Bolt%20of%20Shock\"&gt;exploding shock bolt&lt;/a&gt;.\nDuring their existence, the Dwemer constructed many devices and machines. One of the creations they built was a monstrous golem, called &lt;a href=\"Numidium\"&gt;Numidium&lt;/a&gt;, also known as the \"Brass God.\" Numidium was designed to help them gain the divine power of immortality and transcend &lt;a href=\"Nirn\"&gt;Nirn&lt;/a&gt;, also known as the Mortal Realm. Three powerful tools were designed to help the Tonal Architects tap into and draw power directly from the Heart. These three tools included &lt;a href=\"Keening\"&gt;Keening&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Sunder\"&gt;Sunder&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Wraithguard\"&gt;Wraithguard&lt;/a&gt;. Wraithguard was designed to protect the wearer from the potentially dangerous effects when experimenting with the Heart of Lorkhan. Sunder was designed to extract the specific amount and quality of divine power when working on the Heart. Keening was designed to focus and attune the divine power being extracted from the Heart. Other machines created were the &lt;a href=\"Dwemer%20Convector\"&gt;Dwemer Convector&lt;/a&gt;s, highly advanced machines that were developed and used to alter any soul gem and transform it into a &lt;a href=\"Warped%20Soul%20Gem\"&gt;Warped Soul Gem&lt;/a&gt;. One such device they created was a &lt;a href=\"Control%20Cube\"&gt;Control Cube&lt;/a&gt;, which was designed and used to control specific constructs and maintain them. The Dwemer of &lt;a href=\"Nchardak\"&gt;Nchardak&lt;/a&gt; notably used many of these cubes to maintain their city, by controlling the various power systems that kept the city stable and to control the power system which supplied power to the Reading Room, as they would no doubt want to keep their massive, expansive library safe from outsiders. Another piece of technology the Dwemer constructed were &lt;a href=\"Tonal%20Resonator\"&gt;Tonal Resonator&lt;/a&gt;s. They were used as openers of doors and checkpoint markers between passageways, and still function in modern days. Two devices the Dwemer created were &lt;a href=\"Attunement%20Sphere\"&gt;Attunement Sphere&lt;/a&gt;s and &lt;a href=\"Dwarven%20Mechanism\"&gt;Dwarven Mechanism&lt;/a&gt;s, which were devices designed and used to open the entrance to Blackreach. The two devices directly interacted with one another; by placing an Attunement Sphere into a Dwarven Mechanism, the entrance to Blackreach would be unlocked. However, the pinnacle of their genius was the creation of a device called a &lt;a href=\"Lexicon\"&gt;Lexicon&lt;/a&gt;, which allowed them to read an &lt;a href=\"Elder%20Scroll%20%28Lore%29\"&gt;Elder Scroll&lt;/a&gt; without going mad or blind, as well as acting as a portable information repository, being able to store vast amounts of knowledge within the device, as such combinations of machinery and magic were trademarks of the Dwemer. Dwemer crafters also made various \"toys\" similar to the &lt;a href=\"Coo\"&gt;Coo&lt;/a&gt;. An example of the Dwemer's cultural characteristic for the arcane arts were the Aetherial artifacts: the &lt;a href=\"Aetherial%20Staff\"&gt;Aetherial Staff&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Aetherial%20Shield\"&gt;Aetherial Shield&lt;/a&gt;, and the &lt;a href=\"Aetherial%20Crown\"&gt;Aetherial Crown&lt;/a&gt;, whose powerful enchantments come from &lt;a href=\"Aetherium\"&gt;Aetherium&lt;/a&gt;.\nSmithing.\nThe Dwemer were masters of crafting and smith-work, and made many innovations in the art as well. The Dwemer people of this trade forged weapons, armor, tools, and other materials in their day before the disappearance of their race. A unique ability, known only as &lt;a href=\"Ancient%20Knowledge%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Ancient Knowledge&lt;/a&gt;, was an ability that granted a wearer of Dwarven armor a 25% bonus and &lt;a href=\"Smithing\"&gt;Smithing&lt;/a&gt; increases 15% faster. This knowledge was contained within the Lexicon.\nThe Dwemer had their own &lt;a href=\"Dwarven%20Weapons\"&gt;weapons&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Dwarven%20Armor\"&gt;armor&lt;/a&gt;. These weapons and armors were referred to as Dwarven weapons and armor. After the Dwemer race disappeared in 1E 700, it became difficult for anyone to obtain or forge these artifacts. However, it was possible to craft Dwarven weapons and armor, with the proper knowledge and materials. If one wished to craft Dwarven weapons and armor, &lt;a href=\"Dwemer%20artifacts\"&gt;Dwemer artifacts&lt;/a&gt; had to be obtained, and then melted down into Dwarven Metal, and then molded into a &lt;a href=\"Dwarven%20Metal%20Ingot\"&gt;Dwarven metal ingot&lt;/a&gt;. A variety of materials were required to craft Dwarven weapons, which, depending upon the item(s) intended to be crafted, included Dwarven Metal Ingots, &lt;a href=\"Quicksilver%20Ingot\"&gt;quicksilver&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Steel%20Ingot\"&gt;steel&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Iron%20Ingot\"&gt;iron ingots&lt;/a&gt;, as well as &lt;a href=\"leather%20strips\"&gt;leather strips&lt;/a&gt; and even &lt;a href=\"firewood\"&gt;firewood&lt;/a&gt;. As for the materials required for crafting Dwarven Armor, the materials included Dwarven Metal Ingots, steel ingots, iron ingots, and leather strips, depending upon which item was to be crafted.\nThey were the creators of the &lt;a href=\"Aetherium%20Forge\"&gt;Aetherium Forge&lt;/a&gt;, a massive, magma-fueled forge that was constructed to handle Aetherium and craft materials made from the luminescent crystal. Three items were known to be produced by the Aetherium Forge: the &lt;a href=\"Aetherial%20Crown\"&gt;Aetherial Crown&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"Aetherial%20Staff\"&gt;Aetherial Staff&lt;/a&gt;, and the &lt;a href=\"Aetherial%20Shield\"&gt;Aetherial Shield&lt;/a&gt;. All three items required one &lt;a href=\"Aetherium%20Crest\"&gt;Aetherium Crest&lt;/a&gt;, one for each item. The Aetherial Crown required one Aetherial Crest, two Dwarven Metal Ingots, two &lt;a href=\"gold%20ingot\"&gt;gold ingot&lt;/a&gt;s, and two &lt;a href=\"Sapphire%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;flawless sapphires&lt;/a&gt;. The Aetherial Staff required one Aetherium Crest, two Dwarven Metal Ingots, two ebony ingots, and one gold ingot. The Aetherial Shield required one Aetherium Crest, four Dwarven Metal Ingots and two refined malachite.\nCrafting methods.\nThe Dwemer mainly focused on metallurgy, the study of the physical and chemical elements of metal. It is distinguished from the craft of metalworking in that with metalwork, the craftsman is working with the actual components of metal, a process to \"create individual parts, assemblies or large scale structures.\" The overall concept of Dwarven construction and craftsmanship appeared to have been designed and built to be long-lasting, rather than fragile and easily destructible, which was a possible explanation for their preference of metal. However, other materials such as clay, paper, and glass, though more easily weaker and destructible, cannot be completely eliminated from the known materials that Dwemer crafters may have used to construct their creations. The Dwemer people also studied the principals of engineering, metalwork, and crafting.\nMining and smelting.\nThe Dwemer also had extensive knowledge of mining, extracting, and smelting the ore they found, as well as incorporating the smelted metal into their weapons, armor, tools, devices, and other crafts. Because of this, they were able to create their own distinctive form of &lt;a href=\"Dwarven%20Metal%20Ingot\"&gt;metal&lt;/a&gt;, which was easily mistaken for bronze. Since their disappearance, no other race had been able to successfully replicate the process that was used to create dwarven metal. The only known method that had been successful so far was to melt down existing &lt;a href=\"Bent%20Dwemer%20Scrap%20Metal\"&gt;dwarven metallic scraps&lt;/a&gt; and start over from there. They were also the creators of an elusive concept known as the \"Seven Natures of Metal.\"\nOne other natural resource the Dwemer used was Aetherium. Aetherium was a rare natural material with a blue luminescent hue, strong magical properties, alchemically inert, and harmonically volatile. No known process could enchant, smelt, mold, bind, or break it. To the Dwemer, that was far from complicated; the Aetherium Forge was set up beneath &lt;a href=\"Ruins%20of%20Bthalft\"&gt;Bthalft&lt;/a&gt;. Four &lt;a href=\"Aetherium%20Shard\"&gt;Aetherium Shard&lt;/a&gt;s could be combined to form an &lt;a href=\"Aetherium%20Crest\"&gt;Aetherium Crest&lt;/a&gt;. Aetherium was the primary material in creating the Aetherial Artifacts.\nDwemer boots are described by &lt;a href=\"Raynor%20Vanos\"&gt;Raynor Vanos&lt;/a&gt; as being \"mainly constructed of a flexible material that resembles leather... or the Dwemer had beasts with incredibly smooth and homogenous hide\". This may imply that the Dwemer had developed an artificial leather.\nScience and mathematics.\nBesides mastering in the other arts and professions of their civilization, the Dwemer also mastered the use of mathematics and science in itself and as an asset to their other professions. Science was an important aspect of the Dwemer academic society, especially the science of astronomy. They studied constellations, stars, and planets in order to grasp a better understanding of the outside world. Because of this, the Dwemer constructed large stationary machines\u2014known as an &lt;a href=\"Orrery\"&gt;Orrery&lt;/a&gt;\u2014which were scaled models of a solar system that depicts planetary motions. The Dwemer had made incredible observations of the night sky during their existence. As is known throughout all of Tamriel, &lt;a href=\"Aurbis\"&gt;Aurbis&lt;/a&gt; encompasses Mundus, which includes &lt;a href=\"Nirn\"&gt;Nirn&lt;/a&gt;, its moons, the stars and &lt;a href=\"Aetherius\"&gt;Aetherius&lt;/a&gt;, the realm of the &lt;a href=\"Aedra\"&gt;Aedra&lt;/a&gt;; Nirn is the only planet in the mortal plane, also known as Nirn. The two moons that encompass Nirn are &lt;a href=\"Secunda\"&gt;Secunda&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Masser\"&gt;Masser&lt;/a&gt;, in which Masser is the larger of the two. There is also the &lt;a href=\"Void\"&gt;Void&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Oblivion%20%28Realm%29\"&gt;Oblivion&lt;/a&gt;, which are also immortal realms of the &lt;a href=\"Daedra\"&gt;Daedra&lt;/a&gt;.\nEconomy.\nVery little is known about the Dwemer economy. One form of currency they used is known as the &lt;a href=\"Dwemer%20Coin\"&gt;Dwemer Coin&lt;/a&gt;.\nGovernment.\nAlmost nothing is known about the government of the Dwemer. One policy is known in Dwemer judicial systems: if one was killed by an Animunculi, the associates of the fallen have the authority to disassemble the Animunculi and take its parts within thirty days.\nDuring the First Era, the Dwemer made an alliance with the &lt;a href=\"Chimer\"&gt;Chimer&lt;/a&gt; to expel the &lt;a href=\"Nords\"&gt;Nords&lt;/a&gt; from &lt;a href=\"Morrowind\"&gt;Morrowind&lt;/a&gt;. This governing alliance between the two peoples is known as the &lt;a href=\"First%20Council\"&gt;First Council&lt;/a&gt;. The First Council allied the two civilizations and allowed the two peoples and their cultures to interact with each other."}

The artifacts come in various shapes and sizes, and all are made of the mysterious Dwemer metal, and many, but not all can be smelted down into &lt;a href=\"Dwarven%20Metal%20Ingot\"&gt;Dwarven metal&lt;/a&gt; ingots for making &lt;a href=\"Dwarven%20Armor%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Dwarven armor&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Dwarven%20Weapons%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;weapons&lt;/a&gt;. These ingots can only be found or created by smelting Dwemer artifacts, as there are no veins of Dwemer ore to be mined. Some Dwemer artifacts are quite heavy and yield relatively few ingots, others are light and can be smelted into more than their original weight of ingots.\nThere are some artifacts created by the Dwemer which are not common and are regarded as highly prized and valuable.

No single person will sell all three books, although &lt;a href=\"Jobasha\"&gt;Jobasha&lt;/a&gt; in his &lt;a href=\"Jobasha%27s%20Rare%20Books\"&gt;shop&lt;/a&gt; in Vivec will sell two of them (as will &lt;a href=\"Dorisa%20Darvel\"&gt;Dorisa Darvel&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Balmora%20%28Morrowind%29\"&gt;Balmora&lt;/a&gt;).

To my trained and experienced eyes, it was obvious that this complex would be right where I found it. I dubbed the place \"Lower &lt;a href=\"Bthanual\"&gt;Bthanual&lt;/a&gt;,\" due to its proximity and relative elevation compared to the nearby Bthanual ruins. As with all &lt;a href=\"Dwemer\"&gt;Dwemer&lt;/a&gt; installations, the true purpose of the place eludes me. But that doesn't mean I can't dream and make a few wild guesses.\nAnd, as always, my wild guesses will be closer to the truth than any theories proposed by the so-called scholars who sit in their towers in &lt;a href=\"Mournhold%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Mournhold&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Mages%20Guild%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Mages Guild&lt;/a&gt; halls.\nAs I studied the maps I had drawn of the complex, an idea began to form at the back of my mind. I decided to sleep on it, and I found a safe location that the spiders and spheres seemed to actively avoid. I fell asleep to the gentle whirring of gears and the hiss of steam, and in my sleep, I dreamed.\nI dreamed I was standing in the smaller, southern chamber, surrounded by living, breathing Dwemer. They were so engaged in their work that they didn't notice me as I passed among them. I watched as they fed strange components of metal and other, less easily identifiable substances into the maws of their churning machinery. They didn't speak or pause to rest, and they seemed to me to be almost as mechanical as the gadgets they produced.\nIn my dream, I left the Dwemer workers to their incomprehensible tasks and exited by the eastern corridor. I followed the passage as it curved to the north, ignoring the &lt;a href=\"Dwarven%20Sphere%20%28Online%29\"&gt;spheres&lt;/a&gt; that rolled past me. In the larger chamber, I came upon a bizarre scene. Dozens of Dwemer were crowded around the central platform, intent upon whatever was taking place upon that raised stage. I could see one of the &lt;a href=\"Dwarven%20Centurion%20%28Online%29\"&gt;centurions&lt;/a&gt; upon the platform, as it stood much taller than the Dwemer crowded around it. But I couldn't make out what was happening that had the Dwemer so fascinated. I started to push my way through the crowd in order to get a better view, when something grabbed my arm.\nI thought it must have been one of the Dwemer, who had until this moment completely ignored my presence, but the hand that grabbed me was cold and metallic. When it squeezed, I cried out in pain and opened my eyes. The dream rolled away like a parting mist, and I found myself in the grip of a &lt;a href=\"Dwarven%20Spider%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Dwemer Spider&lt;/a&gt;!\nWell, since you're reading this account, you must have realized by now that I escaped that deadly danger, just as I always do. With style and wit and panache. You would have been amazed!\nBut let me tell you what I found when I opened the chest I stumbled across in the darkest shadows of the far corner of the chamber. The chest appeared a more recent addition to the ruins, not Dwemer in style or function at all. Made me think that maybe I hadn't been the first explorer to discover this site after all. Trust me when I tell you, however, that the contents of the out-of-place chest were almost as remarkable as yours truly, &lt;a href=\"Narsis%20Dren\"&gt;Narsis Dren&lt;/a&gt; \u2014 Treasure Hunter!"}

What about this lengthy (but curiously insubstantial) tome has proved so captivating to the public that it has been able to see off both the scorn of the literati and the scathing critiques of the scholars?\nBefore examining this question, a brief summary of the provenance and subsequent career of Ancient Tales would be appropriate. First published around &lt;a href=\"2E%20670\"&gt;2E670&lt;/a&gt;, in the &lt;a href=\"Interregnum\"&gt;Interregnum&lt;/a&gt; between the fall of the &lt;a href=\"Reman%20Empire\"&gt;First Cyrodilic Empire&lt;/a&gt; and the rise of &lt;a href=\"Tiber%20Septim\"&gt;Tiber Septim&lt;/a&gt;, it was originally presented as a serious, scholarly work based on research in the archives of the &lt;a href=\"University%20of%20Gwylim\"&gt;University of Gwylim&lt;/a&gt;, and in the chaos of that era was taken at face value (a sign of the sad state of Dwemer scholarship in those years). Little is known of the author, but Marobar Sul was most likely a pseudonym of &lt;a href=\"Gor%20Felim\"&gt;Gor Felim&lt;/a&gt;, a prolific writer of \"penny dreadful romances\" of that era, who is known to have used many other pseudonyms. While most of Felim's other work has, thankfully, been lost to history, what little survives matches Ancient Tales in both language and tone (see Lomis, \"Textual Comparison of Gor Felim's &lt;a href=\"A%20Hypothetical%20Treachery\"&gt;A Hypothetical Treachery&lt;/a&gt; with Marobar Sul's &lt;a href=\"Ancient%20Tales%20of%20the%20Dwemer\"&gt;Ancient Tales of the Dwemer&lt;/a&gt;\"). Felim lived in Cyrodiil his whole life, writing light entertainments for the elite of the old Imperial capital. Why he decided to turn his hand to the Dwemer is unknown, but it is clear that his \"research\" consisted of nothing more than collecting the peasants' tales of the Nibenay Valley and recasting them in Dwemer guise.\nThe book proved popular in &lt;a href=\"Cyrodiil\"&gt;Cyrodiil&lt;/a&gt;, and Felim continued to churn out more volumes until the series numbered seven in all. Ancient Tales of the Dwemer was thus firmly established as a local favorite in Cyrodiil (already in its 17th printing) when the historical forces that propelled Tiber Septim to prominence also began to spread the literature of the \"heartland\" across the continent. Marobar Sul's version of the Dwemer was seized upon in a surge of human racial nationalism that has not yet subsided.\nThe Dwemer appear in these tales as creatures of fable and light fantasy, but in general they are \"just like us\". They come across as a bit eccentric, perhaps, but certainly there is nothing fearsome or dangerous about them. Compare these to the Dwemer of early &lt;a href=\"Redguard\"&gt;Redguard&lt;/a&gt; legend: a mysterious, powerful race, capable of bending the very laws of nature to their will; vanished but perhaps not gone. Or the Dwemer portrayed in the most ancient &lt;a href=\"Nord\"&gt;Nord&lt;/a&gt; sagas: fearsome warriors, tainted by blasphemous religious practices, who used their profane mechanisms to drive the Nords from &lt;a href=\"Morrowind\"&gt;Morrowind&lt;/a&gt;. Marobar Sul's Dwemer were much more amenable to the spirit of the time, which saw humans as the pinnacle of creation and the other races as unenlightened barbarians or imperfect, lesser versions of humans eager for tutelage. Ancient Tales falls firmly in the latter camp, which does much to explain its enduring hold on the popular imagination. Marobar Sul's Dwemer are so much more comfortable, so much friendlier, so much more familiar, than the real Dwemer, whose truly mysterious nature we are only beginning to understand. The public prefers the light, trivial version of this vanished race. And from what I have learned in my years of studying the Dwemer, I have some sympathy for that preference. As the following essays will show, the Dwemer were, to our modern eyes, a remarkably unlikeable people in many ways."}

My goal with this text is to share my findings and conclusions based on eighty years spent studying their unique architectural remains.\nThe Migration of the Deep-Elves from their ancestral Dwemereth, now &lt;a href=\"Morrowind\"&gt;Morrowind&lt;/a&gt;, is a generally accepted fact. Recorded history supports this, specifically mentioning the &lt;a href=\"Rourken%20Clan\"&gt;Rourken Clan's&lt;/a&gt; refusal to join King &lt;a href=\"Dumac\"&gt;Dumac&lt;/a&gt; in the forming of the &lt;a href=\"First%20Council\"&gt;First Council&lt;/a&gt;, and their subsequent exodus to &lt;a href=\"Hammerfell\"&gt;Hammerfell&lt;/a&gt;. The architectural premise is also sound, as the building habits of the Dwarves adapted and changed, albeit slowly and in subtle ways, over time and land. I propose that some of these differences are stylistic as well as practical.\nTraditional viewpoints suggest that the &lt;a href=\"Vvardenfell\"&gt;Vvardenfell&lt;/a&gt; Dwemer were the most prolific of their kind. Based on my excavations throughout &lt;a href=\"Skyrim\"&gt;Skyrim&lt;/a&gt;, Morrowind and &lt;a href=\"High%20Rock\"&gt;High Rock&lt;/a&gt;, I am not sure that this is the case. While Vvardenfell is almost cluttered with &lt;a href=\"dwarven%20ruins\"&gt;dwarven ruins&lt;/a&gt; poking through the surface of the landscape, the &lt;a href=\"Vvardenfell%20Architectural%20Styles\"&gt;construction of those ruins&lt;/a&gt; is fundamentally different from the majority of what I've observed elsewhere.\nFurther, as we delve into Vvardenfell ruins, we notice that their internal structure is quite different. While major civic and operational chambers are found near the surface in a Vvardenfell Ruin, that is not typically the case on the Mainland. Minor passageways and storehouse rooms are near the surface, but more important locations don't occur until we explore much deeper.\nBecause such major locations are well-hidden in Dwemer Ruins outside of Morrowind, many scholars believed they were in fact not present in ruins outside that province. This premature conclusion led some to believe such sites to be mere outposts. My research has shown this not to be the case.\nThere are a few theories that may explain this difference. Perhaps Clan architects simply had their own styles and preferences when it came to civic planning. This seems only somewhat likely, as Dwarven techniques were based on empirical study, there was likely little room for creative interpretation when it came to building technique. Geological makeup of the terrain almost certainly played a role, especially in a region like Northern Skyrim where the ground near the surface is very rocky and often frozen, versus the volcanic substratum common in Vvardenfell or the ubiquitous aquifers found in Hammerfell. It's possible that Dwarven architects in the North were not even able to excavate larger structures until reaching more pliable stratum.\nThis scholar would like to suggest, however, that many structures west of Morrowind were built after &lt;a href=\"1E%20420\"&gt;1E420&lt;/a&gt;. When the &lt;a href=\"Clan%20Rourken\"&gt;Clan Rourken&lt;/a&gt; left Vvardenfell, it seems evident that several clans broke off to create their own settlements, and chose to live in greater isolation than their Eastern brethren. This theory is particularly fascinating, because it leads me to believe that Dwarven architects may have developed even more elaborate methods of hiding their strongholds over time.\nThis opens the distinct possibility that undisturbed dwarven archaeological sites exist throughout &lt;a href=\"Tamriel\"&gt;Tamriel&lt;/a&gt;, even in southern areas like &lt;a href=\"Cyrodiil\"&gt;Cyrodiil&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"Black%20Marsh\"&gt;Black Marsh&lt;/a&gt; where Dwarves are not believed to have ever had a significant presence. Though we ought not get carried away on flights of fancy, one could extrapolate this logic to suggest that some Dwarven Clans were living among us for much longer than previously believed, perhaps well beyond the disappearance during the &lt;a href=\"War%20of%20the%20Red%20Mountain\"&gt;War of the Red Mountain&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"1E%20700\"&gt;1E700&lt;/a&gt;.\nDwemer Inquiries Vol II.\nDwemer Inquiries Vol II\nTheir Architecture and Civilization\nby\n&lt;a href=\"Thelwe%20Ghelein\"&gt;Thelwe Ghelein&lt;/a&gt;, Scholar\nIn the Deep Halls, far from &lt;a href=\"Men\"&gt;Men&lt;/a&gt;\nForsaken &lt;a href=\"Red%20Mountain\"&gt;Red Mountain&lt;/a&gt;, Twisted Kin\nHail the Mind, Hail the Stone\nDwarven Pride, Stronger than bone\nThe limited written record supports the perception &lt;a href=\"Deep%20Elves\"&gt;Deep Elves&lt;/a&gt; as culturally revering the pursuits of logic and science. This stands in stark contrast to the belief system of most other &lt;a href=\"mer\"&gt;mer&lt;/a&gt; cultures. When we imagine a society structured around such a central ideology, it seems reasonable that prolific scholars, especially in fields such as mathematics, metallurgy or architecture, would be elevated to social status like that of clergy in a more mystically-inclined culture. The idea is supported by a fragment of &lt;a href=\"Dwemeris\"&gt;Dwemeris&lt;/a&gt; text recovered from a colony in &lt;a href=\"Skyrim\"&gt;Skyrim&lt;/a&gt; - &lt;a href=\"Irkgnthand\"&gt;Irkgnthand&lt;/a&gt; - which I believe to be associated with the &lt;a href=\"Clan%20Rourken\"&gt;Clan Rourken&lt;/a&gt;. The original Dwemeris and my translation Follow:\n[Dwemer writing]: \"Risen by order cousin-of-privilege Cuolec of Scheziline privileged duties. Clanhome building Hoagen Kultorra tradition to hailed World shaper\"\n\"To raise granted-cousin Cuolec of privilege with duties for family-home building Hoagen Kultorra&lt;?&gt; tradition to father &lt;a href=\"Mundus\"&gt;Mundus&lt;/a&gt; shaper\"\nSome scholars interpret this as evidence of Dwemer worship of Mundus, but I do not agree. My translation of this passage suggests that a respected Dwemer by the name of Cuolec was promoted to a civic position, probably tonal architect. The latter half of the fragment suggests that Cuolec's position requires him to build in a specific style.\nThe term Hoagen Kultorra has thus far eluded me, but I believe it may be the name of such a style. It's possible there were several styles, differing in their construction principles and typical structures.\nOne earmark of what I believe was the prevalent Dwemer style among Northern clans was a feature I call the Deep Venue. Deep Venues are often characterized as being made up of one or more expansive natural caverns in which several other structures will occur. Structures within the Venue may be carved from the stone itself, or freely erected upon the cavern floor. The largest and most impressive Venues, such as that found in &lt;a href=\"Bthardamz\"&gt;Bthardamz&lt;/a&gt;, may even feature roads wide enough for ten large men to walk shoulder-meets-shoulder along it.\nArcanex are typically smaller structures. Very few have been properly studied before disruption by grave-robbers or greedy adventurers, but those few undisturbed sites have contained a surprising collection of magical objects such as &lt;a href=\"soul-gem\"&gt;soul-gem&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"alchemical\"&gt;alchemical&lt;/a&gt; concoctions and magical texts. Some scholars take these as evidence that the Dwemer did, in fact, dabble in the magical arts. Based on what we know of their culture, as well as the fact that most arcanex are minor structures compared to other common fixtures, I would suggest that these were centers of study and nothing more. Perhaps the Dwarves established these Halls as a means to study men and &lt;a href=\"mer\"&gt;mer&lt;/a&gt;, who surely seemed as alien to them as the Dwemer seem to us today?\nGreat Animoculotories can be found in many Dwarven strongholds. These were the factories where the &lt;a href=\"centurion\"&gt;centurion&lt;/a&gt;s and various other constructs were built. I have hoped to study these chambers for clues as to the means by which those mysterious &lt;a href=\"automata\"&gt;automata&lt;/a&gt; are given life, but those same guardians make these especially difficult and dangerous areas to explore.\nDwemer Inquiries Vol III.\nMy studies, and this text, have focused heavily on the fact that &lt;a href=\"Dwemer\"&gt;Dwemer&lt;/a&gt; archaeological sites west of &lt;a href=\"Vvardenfell\"&gt;Vvardenfell&lt;/a&gt; seem to be built at much greater depths than their counterparts near the &lt;a href=\"Red%20Mountain\"&gt;Red Mountain&lt;/a&gt;. I believe there was a specific threshold to which Dwarven excavators would dig before the construction of vital structures would begin.\nI have referred to this threshold as the \"Geocline,\" but I have found that to often be redundant with the Deep Venue of a colony. Still, there is some variation in the actual depth of a Deep Venue, whereas the Geocline is always the marker where I reason the City proper begins.\nTunnels and chambers at more shallow depths, while often grand in their architectural style, appear to have served little in the way of critical civic purpose. Surplus stores of food, warehouse chambers that may have been used in trading with nearby surface settlements, or barracks for topside patrols are common above the Geocline.\nThese tunnels, I have observed, can meander in a seemingly more random pattern than those planned structures beneath. I hypothesize that this may be due to the unpredictable nature of any excavation, even to a race as clever as the Dwemer. Surely unexpected deposits of stone or geological events could make the effort difficult, and I think that these haphazard tunnels are often the result of the search for suitable substratum to build within.\nI have found in a small number of ruins reference to a geological anomaly or place known as \"FalZhardum Din\". This is intriguing because the term not only appears in a few tablet fragments, but very specifically on &lt;a href=\"Dwarven%20Mechanism\"&gt;ornate metal frames&lt;/a&gt; in the deepest reaches of the Strongholds &lt;a href=\"Alftand\"&gt;Alftand&lt;/a&gt;, Irkgnthand and &lt;a href=\"Mzinchaleft\"&gt;Mzinchaleft&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"Skyrim\"&gt;Skyrim&lt;/a&gt;. I have yet to decipher the meaning of these elaborate carvings, but consider it highly strange that they occur in the deepest part of each of these ruin.\nRisen by order cousin-of-privilege Cuolec of Scheziline privileged duties. Clanhome building Hoagen Kultorra tradition to Hailed World shaper\"\nThe most reasonable translation of \"&lt;a href=\"Blackreach\"&gt;FalZhardum Din&lt;/a&gt;\" I have managed to decipher is \"Blackest Kingdom Reaches\", but I cannot imagine what that means.\nI suspect there may be some pattern I am failing to notice. This creeping doubt has haunted my career in recent years, and I have begun to doubt if I will unravel some grand secret of the Dwarves in my lifetime, though it lies just under my nose - or indeed, under my feet."}

I believe there was a specific threshold to which Dwarven excavators would dig before the construction of vital structures would begin.\nI have referred to this threshold as the \"Geocline,\" but I have found that to often be redundant with the Deep Venue of a colony. Still, there is some variation in the actual depth of a Deep Venue, whereas the Geocline is always the marker where I reason the City proper begins.\nTunnels and chambers at more shallow depths, while often grand in their architectural style, appear to have served little in the way of critical civic purpose. Surplus stores of food, warehouse chambers that may have been used in trading with nearby surface settlements, or barracks for topside patrols are common above the Geocline.\nThese tunnels, I have observed, can meander in a seemingly more random pattern than those planned structures beneath. I hypothesize that this may be due to the unpredictable nature of any excavation, even to a race as clever as the Dwemer.

These structures once served as significant places of knowledge to the &lt;a href=\"Tonal%20Architect\"&gt;Tonal Architect&lt;/a&gt;s that constructed and maintained them, as well as the Dwemer residents who once lived in them. After the disappearance of the Dwemer, their cities remained untouched and their buildings structurally sound. &lt;a href=\"Falmer\"&gt;Falmer&lt;/a&gt; reclaimed some of the ruins, and the &lt;a href=\"Animunculi\"&gt;Automata&lt;/a&gt; of Dwemer construction still patrol the halls of these ruins as faithfully as they did when their masters were around, presenting an immense danger to those who wish to traverse, navigate and explore.\nThese ruins are of particular interest to scholars of various colleges, universities and private institutions throughout &lt;a href=\"Tamriel\"&gt;Tamriel&lt;/a&gt; and contain items useful for building weapons, armor, and other items of high value; some Dwemer ruins may even contain unique artifacts. Inside Dwemer ruins there are large amounts of useful loot like weapons, clothing, armor, and miscellaneous items. Arguably the most potent enemies are the Dwarven Centurions\u2014massive automatons that have a range of weapons including steam/fire breath, crossbow launchers, one battleaxe, one warhammer, and simple melee attacks such as kicking.\nBefore the disappearance of the Dwemer.\nBefore the Dwemer disappeared, their cities were filled with residents, working, living and studying. Dwemer cities were commonly referred to as strongholds, as well as Freehold colonies and/or city-states. \nDwemer cities contained many different sections for their people, which included living spaces, dwellings, study rooms for academic studies and the arcane arts, areas for the production of &lt;a href=\"Animunculi\"&gt;Animunculi&lt;/a&gt;, pumping stations, pump-houses, aerodromes, war quarters, debate halls, cathedrals, marketplaces, treasuries, armories and storerooms. Some sections of a city were sectioned off for a specific role. An Arcanex was a typically smaller structure in a city, with its role being debated by scholars. Observational studies of the Arcanex in &lt;a href=\"Bthardamz\"&gt;Bthardamz&lt;/a&gt; reveal that the section housed a large collection of magical artifacts, including soul gems, alchemical concoctions and magical texts. Some scholars believe that those observational studies support the idea that the Dwemer did in fact dabble in the magical arts, while other scholars such as Thelwe Ghelein, who conducted the study, believes that the evidence supports an idea that Dwemer scientists and mage-engineers did more than study the arcane arts: that they also studied other &lt;a href=\"Men\"&gt;Men&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Mer\"&gt;Mer&lt;/a&gt;, to learn more about the people who they had no contact with, as they would surely seem as alien to the Dwemer as the Dwemer seem alien to others. Great Animoculotories, or just Animoculotories, were industrial centers of production where &lt;a href=\"Animunculi\"&gt;Animunculi&lt;/a&gt; were constructed.\nDwemer cities varied in size, from the smaller cities like &lt;a href=\"Kagrumez\"&gt;Kagrumez&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Kagrenzel\"&gt;Kagrenzel&lt;/a&gt; to the larger cities such as &lt;a href=\"Mzulft\"&gt;Mzulft&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Alftand\"&gt;Alftand&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Mzinchaleft\"&gt;Mzinchaleft&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Bthardamz\"&gt;Bthardamz&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Irkngthand\"&gt;Irkngthand&lt;/a&gt; to a massive stronghold known as &lt;a href=\"Fal%20Zhardum%20Din\"&gt;Fal Zhardum Din&lt;/a&gt;, or Blackreach. In their cities, the Dwemer people were dedicated to study and research, both in the scientific and arcane studies.\nArchitectural design.\nDwemer cities were primarily built with stone, but was also mixed with an unknown, unique metal, similar to the appearance of copper or bronze, but was truly a unique metal known only to the Dwemer. The stonework and metalwork on the structures were stylized with intricate carvings and runes. Their buildings were designed and constructed as sharp, straight, angular forms that were based on angled lines that were \"intensely mathematical in nature.\" Dwemer architects and city-planners favored \"trusted, well-calculated designs based on angled lines rather than riskier, more imprecise calculations based on arcs and curves.\" With the use of stone and metal and the design and construction methods and common traditions that Dwemer architects had has allowed the buildings to stay structurally sound long after their race disappeared. Many hydraulic systems still functioned in the ruins of the Dwemer cities.\nAs the Dwemer had mastered over stonework and metalwork as an early race, Dwemer ruins were a sight to behold; they were massive and monumental in nature, filled with many grand halls and massive caverns. Dwemer ruins were divided into many different sections, which included great halls, great chambers, upper districts and lower districts, marketplaces, living quarters, cathedrals, aedromes, animunculories, workshops, arcanexes, studies and corridors.\nThey were also filled with hazards such as &lt;a href=\"Traps%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;fire traps&lt;/a&gt;, spike traps and poisoned arrows that were deadly to adventurers.\nTechnology.\nIn several Dwemer cities, most notably &lt;a href=\"Mzulft\"&gt;Mzulft&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Tower%20of%20Mzark\"&gt;Tower of Mzark&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Blackreach\"&gt;Blackreach&lt;/a&gt;, stand &lt;a href=\"Oculory\"&gt;Oculory&lt;/a&gt;, large, stationary and highly advanced constructions which were designed and used for a variety of functions, and rely on both magic and technology to function. The Oculory in Mzulft was designed to collect starlight, analyze it and transmute it into projectable energy, in which it projects a map of &lt;a href=\"Tamriel\"&gt;Tamriel&lt;/a&gt;, and highlights locations of significant, powerful magical artifacts. However, the Oculory in the Tower of Mzark in &lt;a href=\"Blackreach\"&gt;Blackreach&lt;/a&gt; was designed to store and protect artifacts of great significance and power, such as the &lt;a href=\"Elder%20Scroll%20%28Dragon%29\"&gt;Elder Scroll (Dragon)&lt;/a&gt;.\nInhabitants.\nThese ruins contain &lt;a href=\"Animunculi\"&gt;Dwemer Automatons&lt;/a&gt; such as &lt;a href=\"Dwarven%20Centurion\"&gt;Dwarven Centurion&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"Dwarven%20Spider\"&gt;Dwarven Spider&lt;/a&gt;s, and &lt;a href=\"Dwarven%20Sphere\"&gt;Dwarven Sphere&lt;/a&gt;s that search for their fallen creators, the Dwarves. Also to be found are bandits (although notably they don't seem to get very far into the ruins, and thus the automatons make up the bulk of enemies the player must fight in these ruins). The angered spirits of fallen Dwemer, known as &lt;a href=\"Dwarven%20Spectre\"&gt;Dwarven Spectre&lt;/a&gt;s, can be found deep in many ruins throughout Morrowind and Vvardenfell. In Skyrim, a new foe, the &lt;a href=\"Falmer\"&gt;Falmer&lt;/a&gt;, formerly another species of mer called the Snow-Elves, can be found in Dwemer Ruins. Having been driven off the surface, these creatures were \"saved\" by the Dwemer. The Dwemer later poisoned them to make them blind and kept them as a slave workforce. Most of the time these creatures will have prisoners who are normally bandits who have gone looking for treasure."}

The language and writing system was based on &lt;a href=\"Aldmeris\"&gt;Aldmeris&lt;/a&gt;. Very little was known about Dwemeris, and was largely untranslatable, with the exception of a few specific words and passages, though the alphabet was known. Many Dwemer documents were also written in Aldmeris, which made it easier for experts of Aldmeris to translate Dwemer documents and texts. Many examples of its writing system can be found in various books, and even some books were found that were written by the Dwemer themselves. Five notable books written in Dwemeris was \"&lt;a href=\"The%20Egg%20of%20Time\"&gt;The Egg of Time&lt;/a&gt;\", \"&lt;a href=\"Divine%20Metaphysics\"&gt;Divine Metaphysics&lt;/a&gt;\", \"&lt;a href=\"Chronicles%20of%20Nchuleft\"&gt;Chronicles of Nchuleft&lt;/a&gt;\", \"&lt;a href=\"Nchunak%27s%20Fire%20and%20Faith\"&gt;Nchunak's Fire and Faith&lt;/a&gt;\", and \"&lt;a href=\"Hanging%20Gardens\"&gt;Hanging Gardens&lt;/a&gt;\".\nPhonology.\nThe Dwemeris language utilized many runes that look like z's and d's in its form, and the writing system was written as the Dwemer's own form of runes and glyphs.\nDwemeris script/alphabet.\nThe Dwemeris script for letters primarily uses runes. The runes for the letters J, P, X, and Z are not known, but the rest of the alphabet is known (&lt;a href=\"%23Gallery\"&gt;see below&lt;/a&gt;).\nPronunciation.\nThere is little scholarly research into the pronunciation of words in Dwemeris. One student, &lt;a href=\"Amadri%20Drevin\"&gt;Amadri Drevin&lt;/a&gt;, produced a guide for non-Dwemer to attempt to imitate the language around &lt;a href=\"2E%20582\"&gt;2E 582&lt;/a&gt;. Their method involved taking two deep breaths interrupted by a drink of liquor, placing several small pebbles in their mouth, and attempting to recite Dwemer words normally. However, they also noted that speakers should attempt to leave out certain vowels and add additional consonants, emphasizing the third or fourth syllable in any given word, even lacking one."}

Dwynnen is an important city to people of High Rock and the entirety of western &lt;a href=\"Tamriel\"&gt;Tamriel&lt;/a&gt; for the events at the &lt;a href=\"Battle%20of%20Firewaves\"&gt;Battle of Firewaves&lt;/a&gt;.\nDescription.\nGeography.\nThe city of Dwynnen is the seat of power in the Barony of Dwynnen, which is a land-locked region located in the &lt;a href=\"High%20Rock\"&gt;High Rock&lt;/a&gt; side of the Iliac Bay. The city of Dwynnen is located on the shores of the Iliac Bay and is located near a local forest that is home to all sorts of &lt;a href=\"ghoul\"&gt;ghoul&lt;/a&gt;s and &lt;a href=\"goblins\"&gt;goblins&lt;/a&gt;. The Barony is mountainous towards the east and is prone to have blinding blizzards that can halt progress. The furthest settlements to Dwynnen is the city of &lt;a href=\"Camlorn\"&gt;Camlorn&lt;/a&gt; and the town of &lt;a href=\"Aldcroft\"&gt;Aldcroft&lt;/a&gt;.\nHistory.\n&lt;a href=\"First%20Era\"&gt;First Era&lt;/a&gt;.\nIn &lt;a href=\"1E%202920\"&gt;1E 2920&lt;/a&gt;, the city of Dwynnen, along with the rest of High Rock, was under the control of the &lt;a href=\"Reman%20Empire\"&gt;Reman Empire&lt;/a&gt;. During this time, the Reman Empire was warring against the province of &lt;a href=\"Morrowind\"&gt;Morrowind&lt;/a&gt; in a war known as the &lt;a href=\"Four%20Score%20War\"&gt;Four Score War&lt;/a&gt;. A notable figure that participated in the war in the service of &lt;a href=\"Lord%20Vivec\"&gt;Lord Vivec&lt;/a&gt; was a &lt;a href=\"Breton\"&gt;Breton&lt;/a&gt; named &lt;a href=\"Cassyr%20Whitley\"&gt;Cassyr Whitley&lt;/a&gt;. Whitley served as a spy for Vivec and went down in history as the worst spy in the history of Tamriel. During the &lt;a href=\"Battle%20of%20Ald%20Marak\"&gt;Battle of Ald Marak&lt;/a&gt;, Cassyr reported that a horde of &lt;a href=\"Imperial%20Battlemage\"&gt;battlemages&lt;/a&gt; appeared near the city of &lt;a href=\"Bethal%20Gray\"&gt;Bethal Gray&lt;/a&gt; without any boats needed for &lt;a href=\"Lake%20Coronati\"&gt;Lake Coronati&lt;/a&gt;. His intel was incorrect, and it was revealed that the battlemages were masters of &lt;a href=\"Alteration\"&gt;Alteration&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"magic\"&gt;magic&lt;/a&gt;, and they besieged the city of &lt;a href=\"Ald%20Marak\"&gt;Ald Marak&lt;/a&gt;, losing the battle for Vivec in the process. Cassyr would be branded a fool for his actions and be shunned by his peers.\n&lt;a href=\"Second%20Era\"&gt;Second Era&lt;/a&gt;.\nDuring the &lt;a href=\"Interregnum\"&gt;Interregnum&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"2E%20582\"&gt;2E 582&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"Ayleid%20Ruins\"&gt;ruins&lt;/a&gt; of Dwynnarth were used by the members of the &lt;a href=\"Red%20Rook%20Bandits\"&gt;Red Rook Bandits&lt;/a&gt; as a redoubt in the &lt;a href=\"Cambray%20Hills\"&gt;Cambray Hills&lt;/a&gt; region of &lt;a href=\"Glenumbra\"&gt;Glenumbra&lt;/a&gt;. Around the same time, the &lt;a href=\"Bloodthorn%20Cult\"&gt;Bloodthorn Cult&lt;/a&gt; of the &lt;a href=\"Western%20Reach\"&gt;Western Reach&lt;/a&gt; invaded the region of Glenumbra in the attempt to destroy the &lt;a href=\"Daggerfall%20Covenant\"&gt;Daggerfall Covenant&lt;/a&gt;. The Red Rooks had also wreaked havoc across the area by hitting locations such as &lt;a href=\"Crosswych\"&gt;Crosswych&lt;/a&gt; and the northern &lt;a href=\"Daenia\"&gt;Daenia&lt;/a&gt; woodlands near &lt;a href=\"Aldcroft\"&gt;Aldcroft&lt;/a&gt;. Both the Bloodthorn Cult and the Red Rooks gathered at Dwynnarth to discuss an alliance between each other to benefit both parties in the possible aftermath of this mini-war. The meeting was dissolved by the &lt;a href=\"Lion%20Guard\"&gt;Lion Guard&lt;/a&gt; of the Covenant and an agent called the &lt;a href=\"Vestige\"&gt;Vestige&lt;/a&gt;. The war would soon end in northern &lt;a href=\"King%27s%20Guard\"&gt;King's Guard&lt;/a&gt; with the death of &lt;a href=\"Angof%20the%20Gravesinger%20%28Character%29\"&gt;Angof the Gravesinger&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Undaunted\"&gt;Undaunted&lt;/a&gt; chapter in &lt;a href=\"Daggerfall\"&gt;Daggerfall&lt;/a&gt; received word of strange occurrences happening in the lower ruins of Dwynnarth called &lt;a href=\"Spindleclutch\"&gt;Spindleclutch&lt;/a&gt;. A group of warriors from the &lt;a href=\"Fighters%20Guild\"&gt;Fighters Guild&lt;/a&gt; traveled to Spindleclutch to clean out the spiders but learned that a mysterious force is working deep within the cavern and this force caused many members to disappear and some to die. The Undaunted sent a group of their own spelunkers to remove Spindleclutch, recover the missing troops, and learn the source of the deadly whispers. A dangerous &lt;a href=\"Spider%20Daedra\"&gt;Spider Daedra&lt;/a&gt; called &lt;a href=\"the%20Whisperer\"&gt;the Whisperer&lt;/a&gt; was using the spiders to bring her victims to become either her meal or her thralls of death. The Whisperer was defeated, and peace returned to Dwynnarth. The &lt;a href=\"vampire\"&gt;vampire&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Vorenor%20Winterbourne\"&gt;Vorenor Winterbourne&lt;/a&gt; and his clan would occupy the ruins once the Whisperer was defeated, who would also be removed.\n&lt;a href=\"Third%20Era\"&gt;Third Era&lt;/a&gt;.\nIn &lt;a href=\"3E%20121\"&gt;3E 121&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Empress\"&gt;Empress&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Kintyra%20Septim\"&gt;Kintyra Septim&lt;/a&gt; traveled across the Barony of Dwynnen to rendezvous with the Duke of &lt;a href=\"Glenpoint%20%28Daggerfall%29\"&gt;Glenpoint&lt;/a&gt; after crossing the &lt;a href=\"Dragontail%20Mountains\"&gt;Dragontail Mountains&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Hammerfell\"&gt;Hammerfell&lt;/a&gt; and bypassing the &lt;a href=\"Bangkorai%20Pass\"&gt;Bangkorai Pass&lt;/a&gt; to reach High Rock. Kintyra was able to reach Glenpoint but was betrayed by the Duke and was imprisoned by &lt;a href=\"Potema%20Septim\"&gt;Potema Septim&lt;/a&gt;, the Wolf-Queen of &lt;a href=\"Solitude\"&gt;Solitude&lt;/a&gt;. Her imprisonment led to her eventual execution. Her death resulted in &lt;a href=\"Cephorus%20Septim\"&gt;Cephorus Septim&lt;/a&gt; assuming the throne and becoming the &lt;a href=\"Emperor\"&gt;Emperor&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"Tamriel\"&gt;Tamriel&lt;/a&gt;.\nIn &lt;a href=\"3E%20253\"&gt;3E 253&lt;/a&gt;, the city of Dwynnen was under the control of a wrathful &lt;a href=\"Lich\"&gt;Lich&lt;/a&gt; and his army of &lt;a href=\"undead\"&gt;undead&lt;/a&gt; warriors ranging from &lt;a href=\"zombie\"&gt;zombie&lt;/a&gt;s and vampires. The Lich ruled from &lt;a href=\"Castle%20Wightmoor\"&gt;Castle Wightmoor&lt;/a&gt;, the seat of power in Dwynnen. A &lt;a href=\"Breton\"&gt;Breton&lt;/a&gt; warrior named &lt;a href=\"Othrok\"&gt;Othrok&lt;/a&gt; arrived into the city of Dwynnen and was blessed by the gods to defeat the undead army of Dwynnen. Othrok was given an army of men and animals to defeat the Lich. Othrok was successful, and he became the new Baron of Dwynnen. Through his leadership, Dwynnen grew larger that it ever did before.\nIn &lt;a href=\"3E%20267\"&gt;3E 267&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Haymon%20Camoran\"&gt;Haymon Camoran&lt;/a&gt; launched an invasion from all over western Tamriel starting from &lt;a href=\"Arenthia\"&gt;Arenthia&lt;/a&gt; to the city of &lt;a href=\"Reich%20Gradkeep\"&gt;Reich Gradkeep&lt;/a&gt; in a matter of over ten years. The leaders of the Iliac superpowers, the cities of &lt;a href=\"Daggerfall\"&gt;Daggerfall&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Wayrest\"&gt;Wayrest&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Sentinel\"&gt;Sentinel&lt;/a&gt; were unable to unite their provinces to fight against the Camoran Usurper. This caused multiple cities to fall such as &lt;a href=\"Taneth\"&gt;Taneth&lt;/a&gt;, Reich Gradkeep, and &lt;a href=\"Rihad\"&gt;Rihad&lt;/a&gt;. When Haymon Camoran arrived into the Iliac Bay, Baron Othrok and the leaders of &lt;a href=\"Kambria%20%28Region%29\"&gt;Kambria&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Phrygias%20%28Region%29\"&gt;Phrygias&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Ykalon%20%28Region%29\"&gt;Ykalon&lt;/a&gt; gathered to create one of the strongest navies to appear in the history of Tamriel. This United Force was equal in power to the &lt;a href=\"Imperial%20Legion\"&gt;Imperial Legion&lt;/a&gt;s that traveled to &lt;a href=\"Akavir\"&gt;Akavir&lt;/a&gt;. The subsequent battle was known as the &lt;a href=\"Battle%20of%20Firewaves\"&gt;Battle of Firewaves&lt;/a&gt; and it ended the reign of the Camoran Usurper. Baron Othrok's accomplishments would be celebrated in Othroktide for future generations."}

Within the library was all the knowledge of creation, consisting of logical predictions of the actions, events and deeds of all sentient lifeforms (creature, &lt;a href=\"mortal\"&gt;mortal&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Daedra\"&gt;Daedra&lt;/a&gt;) in existence, that previously existed, and would ever exist, using the logical formulae found within the library.\nWhen &lt;a href=\"Sheogorath\"&gt;Sheogorath&lt;/a&gt; was born from Jyggalag's curse, and discovered the Great Library, he had the knowledge burned and the library destroyed, seeing it as an abomination as he viewed that personal choice surpassed logical prediction. Sheogorath destroyed everything except for Dyus, unable to bring himself to destroy the knowledge he possessed. To prevent others from locating him and using his knowledge with ill intent, Sheogorath imprisoned Dyus inside Knifepoint Hollow and granted him immortality, making sure that he wouldn't die within his prison.\nInteractions.\n&lt;a href=\"Symbols%20of%20Office\"&gt;Symbols of Office&lt;/a&gt;.\n&lt;a href=\"Haskill%20%28Shivering%20Isles%29\"&gt;Haskill&lt;/a&gt; recommends that the &lt;a href=\"Hero%20of%20Kvatch\"&gt;Hero&lt;/a&gt; see Dyus at &lt;a href=\"Knifepoint%20Hollow\"&gt;Knifepoint Hollow&lt;/a&gt;. Dyus will tell the Hero that the &lt;a href=\"Ciirta\"&gt;Eye of Ciirta&lt;/a&gt; and a branch from the Tree of Shades are needed. Once both items have been collected, return to Dyus. He will create the unfinished Staff. He then says to travel to the Tree of Madness in &lt;a href=\"Sheogorath%27s%20Palace%23Throne%20Room\"&gt;Sheogorath's throne room&lt;/a&gt; and tap the Tree's power to complete the staff.\nPersonality.\nDyus portrays himself as a reserved individual, whose immortality and eternal imprisonment are of no bother. To him, individuality is an illusion, and he considers his own life and existence is just about as important, in the long run, as the entire history of a stone. Despite believing this, he will still answer questions about his past. He also considers space and time as artificial concepts, used by men of baser intellect to make sense of the world, and states that only a few fortunate minds can see past this convention.\nDue to his knowledge of Jyggalag's logical formulae, he is said to possess knowledge of every event to ever occur. If asked about him, Haskill will mention that Dyus knows things that even the &lt;a href=\"Daedric%20Princes\"&gt;Daedric Princes&lt;/a&gt; do not know, making him a powerful individual. However, due to his determinism, he considers these events and their occurrence as unchangeable and certain, and does not attempt to interfere. Those who believe in personal choice, however, such as Sheogorath and &lt;a href=\"Haskill\"&gt;Haskill&lt;/a&gt;, consider this idea \"debatable.\" He also does not seem to discriminate as to who he will give knowledge to, as he helped the Hero gain the means to defeat his old master, despite predicting certain failure.\nDespite his determinism, he incorrectly predicted that the Hero would not be able to acquire the ingredients for the &lt;a href=\"Staff%20of%20Sheogorath\"&gt;Staff of Sheogorath&lt;/a&gt;. When he discovered this, he was somewhat surprised, and expressed that he was now uncertain of the Hero's fate, though he immediately attributed this to an error in deduction on his part. After completing the questline and returning to him, he will state that he loathes the concept of personal choice, as it makes things imprecise. When asked about his imprisonment, he states that he knows when the new Sheogorath intends to finally free him, and asks for the Hero to leave them be.\nDialogue.\n\"I have been waiting for you, Your Grace. This day, as all days before and after, is well known to me. There are no surprises to Dyus of Mytheria. Sheogorath has fallen and you seek the means to foil the machinations of the Prince of Order. You seek the Throne of Madness. However, no mortal may sit upon the throne without the staff. So here you are in my prison, seeking to supplant the one who placed me here. If you wish to take the place of Sheogorath, then ask me what you will.\"\nAfter retrieving the Eye of Ciirta:\n\"Contrary to your goals, you remain here with me. If you seek the recreation of the staff, then you must bring the eye and the branch.\"\nAfter retrieving the Branch:\n\"Contrary to your goals, you remain here with me. If you seek the recreation of the staff, then you must bring the eye and the branch.\"\nAfter collecting both components:\n\"You have the items. Contrary to all prediction.

If you wish to confront what is to come, I shall create the Staff for you.\"\nIf approached again:\n\"Inaction conflicts with your purpose. The longer you are here with me, the further the balance shifts towards your enemy. There is no other way.\"\n\"Hrmph... it seems that I made a miscalculation. Against all odds and all the knowledge that I possess, a new Sheogorath is risen. How I loathe the idea of personal choice. It makes things so... imprecise. However, you shall still fall victim to the same pitfalls as he. Leave me to my torment, Madgod. Leave me to suffer as Sheogorath before you.\"\nIf approached again:\n\"Lord Sheogorath... as I expected. I will hear you and then ask for peace from your prattle.\"\n\"Say what you will, receive your answers, and leave me to my solitude.\"\n\"Yes, Lord Sheogorath? Why do you disturb me?\""}

His first wife was &lt;a href=\"Carolyna\"&gt;Carolyna&lt;/a&gt;, with whom he had a daughter, &lt;a href=\"Elysana\"&gt;Elysana&lt;/a&gt;. After Queen Carolyna's death, Eadwyre married &lt;a href=\"Barenziah%20%28Daggerfall%29\"&gt;Barenziah&lt;/a&gt;, former Queen of &lt;a href=\"Morrowind\"&gt;Morrowind&lt;/a&gt;.\nHistory.\nHe married Barenziah during the reign of &lt;a href=\"Jagar%20Tharn\"&gt;Jagar Tharn&lt;/a&gt;. Barenziah and Eadwyre plotted to end Jagar Tharn's reign. From Tharn's diary, Barenziah managed to locate the pieces of the &lt;a href=\"Staff%20of%20Chaos\"&gt;Staff of Chaos&lt;/a&gt;, a staff that was used by Tharn to banish the &lt;a href=\"Emperor\"&gt;Emperor&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Uriel%20Septim%20VII\"&gt;Uriel Septim VII&lt;/a&gt; to another dimension. She then relayed the information, and eventually the information came to the ghost of &lt;a href=\"Ria%20Silmane\"&gt;Ria Silmane&lt;/a&gt;.\u00a0And in turn Ria would relay the information to her champion to collect the pieces of the staff.\nAfter Barenziah deciphered the last location of the pieces of the Staff of Chaos, Eadwyre and Barenziah secretly escaped from the &lt;a href=\"Imperial%20City\"&gt;Imperial City&lt;/a&gt;. Concerned with political issues, although he knew that they had escaped, Tharn lets them go. Barenziah was then married to King Eadwyre and became the Queen of Wayrest. She brought her two children, and Eadwyre adopted them.\nThe relationship of the two Dunmeri children and Princess Elsyana was and is quite unpleasant, especially between &lt;a href=\"Helseth%20Hlaalu%20%28Daggerfall%29\"&gt;Helseth&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Elysana\"&gt;Elysana&lt;/a&gt;. It was obvious that Helseth wanted the Wayrest throne, while Elysana did everything to prevent that, and wanted the throne for herself.\nDuring the &lt;a href=\"War%20for%20Betony\"&gt;War for Betony&lt;/a&gt;, Wayrest remained neutral. In fact, Wayrest faced other problems. One from the sea, the &lt;a href=\"Iliac%20Bay\"&gt;Iliac Bay&lt;/a&gt; Pirates, and the other from the land, the &lt;a href=\"Orc%20%28Daggerfall%29\"&gt;Orsimer&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"Orsinium%20%28Daggerfall%29\"&gt;Orsinium&lt;/a&gt;. Eadwyre was unwilling to send troops to fight on either side in the war. After the war, Wayrest benefitted from it. The pirates were driven out, followed by the &lt;a href=\"Imperial%20Navy\"&gt;Imperial Navy&lt;/a&gt;. The pirates haven, the &lt;a href=\"Isle%20of%20Balfiera%20%28Daggerfall%29\"&gt;Isle of Balfiera&lt;/a&gt;, was then haunted by undead raised by &lt;a href=\"Nulfaga\"&gt;Nulfaga&lt;/a&gt; as a result from the witch's insanity.\nKing Eadwyre was one of the wielders of the &lt;a href=\"Numidium\"&gt;Numidium&lt;/a&gt;. He was one of the seven retrievers of the &lt;a href=\"Totem%20of%20Tiber%20Septim\"&gt;Totem of Tiber Septim&lt;/a&gt;, a tool for controlling the &lt;a href=\"Dwemer\"&gt;Dwemer&lt;/a&gt; construct. Originally there was only one Totem but a strange time warping effect known as the &lt;a href=\"Warp%20in%20the%20West\"&gt;Warp in the West&lt;/a&gt; made all seven parties of Iliac Bay receive the totem.\nEadwyre died sometime between 3E 417 and 3E 427. After the death of King Eadwyre, Princess Elysana finally won the crown of Wayrest, and then banishes Barenziah and Helseth back to Morrowind. &lt;a href=\"Morgiah\"&gt;Morgiah&lt;/a&gt;, on the other hand, had already left Wayrest at that time.\nInteractions.\n&lt;a href=\"Blackmail%20%28Daggerfall%29\"&gt;Blackmail&lt;/a&gt;.\nPrince Helseth's letters can be given to Eadwyre, who will be disappointing in Helseth's plot.\n&lt;a href=\"Lysandus%27%20Revenge\"&gt;Lysandus' Revenge&lt;/a&gt;.\nLord &lt;a href=\"Woodborne\"&gt;Woodborne&lt;/a&gt;'s Diary reveals that he is plotting against Eadwyre.

He promises gold if the Totem is delivered to him, but no reward is actually granted to the Hero.

You did well by bringing this to my attention, . Thank you.\"\n\"This is atrocious! After all the affection we showered on that fool Woodborne! We nearly married that villianous swine to Elysana -- nearly handed the throne of Wayrest to a cad of the first order! Good , it was the right thing to do to bring this to our attention. Rest assured that Lord Woodborne will be arrested and executed for his treason, his name barred from the books of honor, his acquaintances interrogated, his fortune confiscated. As a gift, please allow me to give you gold pieces as your share of his property confiscations.\"\n\"Fool! Did you really think I would pay you for the Totem? Kill the !\""}

He is amazed by the stone's ability to produce endless water, and studies it extensively, almost disregarding everything else that's happening on the island.

Eamond Guimard was a noteworthy leader, known for his friendliness and strong-will, a contrast to the wildlands of the region of &lt;a href=\"Bangkorai\"&gt;Bangkorai&lt;/a&gt;.\nHistory.\nBackground &amp; Reign.\nEamond Guimard was the son of &lt;a href=\"Blaise%20Guimard\"&gt;Blaise Guimard&lt;/a&gt;, the King of Evermore that took the throne in the aftermath of &lt;a href=\"Durcorach\"&gt;Durcorach&lt;/a&gt;'s invasion of High Rock. He was given the throne for his efforts of retaking the city of Evermore from the &lt;a href=\"Reachmen\"&gt;Reachmen&lt;/a&gt;. House Guimard had become royalty in the eyes of the early &lt;a href=\"Daggerfall%20Covenant\"&gt;Daggerfall Covenant&lt;/a&gt; and as a reward, Prince Eamond married &lt;a href=\"Arzhela%20of%20Cumberland\"&gt;Arzhela of Cumberland&lt;/a&gt;, the niece of High King Emeric. When King Blaise died in &lt;a href=\"2E%20568\"&gt;2E 568&lt;/a&gt;, Eamond inherited the throne and became King of Evermore. He had two children, &lt;a href=\"Prince%20Adrien\"&gt;Adrien Guimard&lt;/a&gt;, the Crown Prince of Evermore, and &lt;a href=\"Princess%20Elara\"&gt;Elara Guimard&lt;/a&gt;. During his reign, Eamond had become a favorable leader among the other leaders of the Daggerfall Covenant, as he was known to be friends with &lt;a href=\"King%20Kurog\"&gt;King Kurog&lt;/a&gt; of the &lt;a href=\"Second%20Orsinium\"&gt;Second Orsinium&lt;/a&gt;. It was King Eamond that gave the &lt;a href=\"Imperial\"&gt;Imperial&lt;/a&gt; scribe, &lt;a href=\"Flaccus%20Terentius\"&gt;Flaccus Terentius&lt;/a&gt; the writ of transit to take them into the &lt;a href=\"Wrothgarian%20Mountains\"&gt;Wrothgarian Mountains&lt;/a&gt;.\nDeath.\nKing Eamond Guimard ruled over Evermore for several years until he had died in &lt;a href=\"2E%20582\"&gt;2E 582&lt;/a&gt; when the &lt;a href=\"Seventh%20Legion\"&gt;Seventh Legion&lt;/a&gt;, under the command of &lt;a href=\"Septima%20Tharn\"&gt;Septima Tharn&lt;/a&gt; had invaded the west around the &lt;a href=\"Bjoulsae%20River\"&gt;Bjoulsae River&lt;/a&gt;. King Eamond and the &lt;a href=\"Order%20of%20Saint%20Pelin\"&gt;Order of Saint Pelin&lt;/a&gt; had amassed their forces at the &lt;a href=\"Bangkorai%20Garrison\"&gt;Bangkorai Garrison&lt;/a&gt; to face against the Legion, who he had very little respect for, especially Septima Tharn and her lineage, &lt;a href=\"House%20Tharn\"&gt;House Tharn&lt;/a&gt;. The battle had ultimately resulted in King Eamond's death and mourning. Because of the Seventh Legion, the Kingdom of Evermore had lost the southern portion of Bangkorai, including the city-state of &lt;a href=\"Hallin%27s%20Stand\"&gt;Hallin's Stand&lt;/a&gt;. Regent-Queen Arzhela was grieving for her husband, while Princess Elara had become irresponsible and fickle, while Prince Adrien had signs of a gambling problem and alcoholism. Because of this, the Seventh Legion had begun to spread propaganda throughout Evermore, so that the Legion would be handed the city over. However, an &lt;a href=\"Vestige\"&gt;Agent&lt;/a&gt; of the Covenant had intervened, bringing the Covenant and High King Emeric into Bangkorai, beginning the retaking of the region and the demise of Septima Tharn."}

The conflict revolved around the artifact, which is odd since by the &lt;a href=\"Dwemer\"&gt;Dwemer&lt;/a&gt;s' own account it was not within the city and the timing is all off. Why would the Ayleids attack the Dwemer while their empire was in the midst of a &lt;a href=\"Alessian%20Slave%20Rebellion\"&gt;slave rebellion&lt;/a&gt;?\nMzulft was plagued by conflict in the years surrounding that account. The city repelled attacks from the &lt;a href=\"Nords%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Nords&lt;/a&gt;, Ayleids, and even neighboring Dwemer clans. Were they all after the Wrathstone?\nThe great Dwemer architect, &lt;a href=\"Mhuvnak\"&gt;Mhuvnak&lt;/a&gt;, disappeared from Mzulft around this time. The prevailing theory is that he was a casualty of war, but from what I've found, there's no reason to believe Mzulft suffered any significant losses before the Nords sacked it during the reign of &lt;a href=\"High%20King%20Gellir\"&gt;High King Gellir&lt;/a&gt;.\nI have it! &lt;a href=\"Kagrenzel\"&gt;Kagrenzel&lt;/a&gt;. Mhuvnak departed for Kagrenzel after the Ayleid raid. He'd have no reason to leave the safety of the city for a small holdout in the mountains unless there was something important there. Tomorrow I make for &lt;a href=\"Eastmarch%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Eastmarch&lt;/a&gt;.\nAnother setback. The pair of Nords I hired as an escort fell, quite literally, into a death trap almost immediately. This place reminds me more of &lt;a href=\"Yokudan\"&gt;Yokudan&lt;/a&gt; tombs than Dwemer remnants. It seems like its entire purpose is to kill those who would search it.\nAfter a very cautious search of Kagrenzel, I'm confident that the Wrathstone is not here. My current theory is that Mhuvnak came here to retrieve it. For all its devious designs, this place is best suited for catching thieves, not rebuffing an army. Mhuvnak must not have trusted the defenses to protect the artifact from his rivals.\nMhuvnak was the most brilliant architect of his time. I don't believe someone as meticulous as he was to just take the Wrathstone and run off without a plan. Mzulft may have more answers.\nI decided to forgo an escort this time. I don't have much luck with them and I'll need to take my time searching Mzulft for answers. Unsurprisingly, &lt;a href=\"animunculi\"&gt;animunculi&lt;/a&gt; still roam the halls continuing their duties in an unbroken circuit for all time. I hear things though, echoing from deep in the ruins. Muffled clatter and animal shrieks. Something is keeping the constructs occupied, and that's a benefit to me, for now.\nI'm running out of paper to contain my notes on Mzulft thus far, and I've only scratched the surface of this city. Most scholars would be content to spend their lives unraveling the secrets of this place, but I have my sights set higher than most. No more distractions. Find what I can about Mhuvnak and where he may have escaped to.\nThere is an observatory of sorts in Mzulft, dominated by a device that fills the room. I've never seen anything like it. I didn't think Dwemer were known for their appreciation of the world above them, let alone the sky.\nThere are surviving writings here. Not from the time of Mhuvnak, but long after. The Dwemer reclaimed Mzulft from the Nords and were thriving before their ultimate disappearance. This device, the &lt;a href=\"Oculory\"&gt;Oculory&lt;/a&gt;, could observe the world with frightening acuity, when it worked. The Dwemer were using it to locate the lost Vault of Mhuvnak, but the \"&lt;a href=\"Frostvault\"&gt;Frostvault&lt;/a&gt;\" is buried in a mountain of ice. I've found no record of an attempt to reclaim it for their kingdom.\nIf I've interpreted things correctly, I believe I know where the Frostvault may be found; however, I'm running low on funds. &lt;a href=\"Quintus%20Verres\"&gt;Quintus&lt;/a&gt;'s estate was more debt than assets and if I'm to see this through I can't afford to be wrong.\nI'm on the right path, I'm sure of it. I found evidence of Dwemer construction in the mountains to the west. It looks like the ice has retreated in the ages between when my records were written and today. I'd love to see what else the melting glacier has revealed, but the resulting crevasse has become an attractive shelter for &lt;a href=\"Goblin%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Goblins&lt;/a&gt;. After everything I've been through, I will not be stopped by a band of grubby rat-eaters. I'll take the gamble and put everything on this being the site of the Frostvault."}

He will talk to you about a lost race of Elves over a little alcohol. These Elves are known as \"Falmer\" or &lt;a href=\"Snow%20Elves\"&gt;Snow Elves&lt;/a&gt; and he will eventually ask to hire you to help him. Accept and you'll get 200 gold up front.\nThe Snow Elves.\nYou can find proof in the &lt;a href=\"Jolgeirr%20Barrow\"&gt;Jolgeirr Barrow&lt;/a&gt;, Among several items you will find there will be the &lt;a href=\"Spear%20of%20the%20Snow%20Prince\"&gt;Spear of the Snow Prince&lt;/a&gt;, an almost complete set of &lt;a href=\"Ancient%20Steel%20Armor\"&gt;Ancient Steel Armor&lt;/a&gt; and a book, The Fall of the Snow Prince.\nProof.\nTake everything, including the book, which is the proof that Athellor wants. After reading the book, you'll get a journal entry, then return it to Athellor and receive 800 gold in reward. Fortunately, you can keep all the items you found, except for the book which Athellor takes."}

Certainly there is variation in personality between individuals, but there are some things a &lt;a href=\"Bosmer%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Bosmer&lt;/a&gt; can always expect from an Orc. None of which our culture can fully comprehend.\nTheir &lt;a href=\"Wood%20Orc\"&gt;Wood Orc&lt;/a&gt; cousins are stranger still, but for different reasons. They ironically share more commonalities with the Bosmer, and are found mostly within &lt;a href=\"Valenwood%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Valenwood&lt;/a&gt;.\nThough Wood Orcs prize strength and honor and above all else, their interpretation of what those things mean separates them from their northern, &lt;a href=\"Orsinium%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Orsinium&lt;/a&gt; cousins. For instance, having strength to a Wood Orc means having agility and mobility as much as it does muscular power and endurance. I would like to hear an Orsinium Orc's take on the topic, but I imagine that, if one considers an Orsinium Orc as formed like a member of a heavy infantry regiment, then a Wood Orc is like a light skirmisher in the same army.\nThe Wood Orcs, like the Bosmer, also flourish in forested areas. They've made no Pact with the Green - by my bow, they have utter disregard for and a lack of knowledge of the &lt;a href=\"Green%20Pact\"&gt;Green Pact&lt;/a&gt; - but I wouldn't be surprised if they stood in &lt;a href=\"Y%27ffre\"&gt;Y'ffre&lt;/a&gt;'s favor in some way, with the ease I've seen them navigate tree-laden regions.\nWhy worry about this? I've had Wood Orcs in the mind lately - it's difficult not to when one has been among them, as I have. I was ordered through their territory by a local &lt;a href=\"Battlereeve\"&gt;Battlereeve&lt;/a&gt; to deliver a message - was told it would be easy to avoid detection. But Wood Orcs are a very different breed of Orc, as I've detailed above. When they caught me - no one save a Bosmer ever catches me - they noticed my presence in the trees above, though I suspect they must have been wary of something in their forest for days. I was ready, though, and felled two of the trio who turned on me with the same arrow.\nI was taken aback - I had expected to fell three. But the last one - inexplicably, and in a most un-Orcish fashion - bolted out the way, like lightning. I leapt, rolled to the ground, just as a curved hand-axe whirled into the trees, through the space where my heart would have been. I came to my feet with dagger ready, and parried a blow from a second handaxe that nearly shook the knife from my hand. The Wood Orc growled and swung again, and in that moment, I couldn't have told him from his Orsinium cousins. He fought with the agility and grace of my people, mixed with the honorbound fury of the northern Orcs. He managed to tear a deep wound in my side, as I tossed a handful of dirt into his eyes. Half-blinded by pain myself, I stumbled to relative safety in the darkness of the woods as he cursed and spat, called me a \"coward who disguised himself with the forest instead of fighting with it.\"\n&lt;a href=\"Hircine%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Hircine&lt;/a&gt; must have walked with me that day, for I was sure that battle was lost. The Wood Orc fought too fiercely, knew his own forest too well. But he never did manage to find me again. I would welcome a second contest - but in Bosmer territory."}

Dorvayn informs the Nerevarine that the Mine will fail if the &lt;a href=\"Kwama%20Queen%20%28Morrowind%29\"&gt;Kwama Queen&lt;/a&gt; is killed (along with the other Kwama inside the mine). She also suggests that the Nerevarine travel to &lt;a href=\"Suran%20%28Morrowind%29\"&gt;Suran&lt;/a&gt; and then head to the mine from there.\nA talk with Oran (Optional).\nAt this point two paths are open to the Nerevarine. They may proceed to the Mine (southeast of Suran) or speak to the Mine's owner, Serjo Avon Oran. Oran can be exploited for up to 1,000 in order to protect his interests, at which point the Nerevarine will be given another choice of quest progression. They can either take Oran's deal and return to &lt;a href=\"Balmora%20%28Morrowind%29\"&gt;Balmora&lt;/a&gt; (gaining a 5-point reputation boost in House Hlaalu and a -10 &lt;a href=\"disposition\"&gt;disposition&lt;/a&gt; swing from Dorvayn), refuse Oran's offer (at the cost of a disposition drop from Oran) or take Oran's money and then proceed to kill the Queen. Either choice is fine.\nKilling the Queen.\nIf the Nerevarine decided to refuse Oran's deal or go back Oran's deal (or indeed not speak to him at all), then they must kill the Kwama Queen at the Inanius Egg Mine to complete the quest. The Mine itself can be found to the southeast of Suran and has been partially flooded, meaning that the Nerevarine will have to swim to get to the Queen. Once the Queen has been killed, the Nerevarine must return to Dorvayn to receive their reward and complete the quest."}

The people have come to accept it. They bury their dead by daylight, and are away before &lt;a href=\"Masser\"&gt;Masser&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Secunda\"&gt;Secunda&lt;/a&gt; have risen and the evil comes forth. The only victims to fall prey to the devils within are the very stupid and the outsiders.\u201d\n\u201cIt sounds like a natural solution to filtering out the undesirables then,\u201d laughed Nitrah, a tall, middle-aged woman with cold eyes and thin lips. \u201cWhere is the gold in saving them?\u201d\n\u201cFrom the Temple. They're re-opening a new monastery near the cemetery, and they need the land cleansed of evil. They're offering a fortune, so I accepted the assignment with the caveat that I could assemble my own team to split the reward. That's why I've sought you each out. From what I've heard, you, Nitrah, are the best bladesman in &lt;a href=\"Morrowind\"&gt;Morrowind&lt;/a&gt;.\u201d Nitrah smiled her unpleasant best.\n\u201cAnd you, Osmic, are a renowned &lt;a href=\"burglar\"&gt;burglar&lt;/a&gt;, though never once imprisoned.\u201d The bald-pated young man stammered as if to refute the charges, before grinning back, \u201cI'll get you in where you need to go. But then it's up to you to do what you need to do. I'm no combatter.\u201d\n\u201cAnything Nitrah and I can't handle, I'm sure Massitha will prove her mettle,\u201d Phlaxith said, turning to the fourth member of the party. \u201cShe comes on very good references as a sorceress of great power and skill.\u201dMassitha was the picture of innocence, round-faced and wide-eyed. Nitrah and Osmic looked at her uncertainly, particularly watching her fearful expressions as Phlaxith described the nature of the creatures haunting the cemetery. It was obvious she had never faced any adversary other than man and mer before. If she survived, they thought to themselves, it would be very surprising.\nAs the foursome trudged toward the graveyard at dusk, they took the opportunity to quiz their new teammate.\u201c&lt;a href=\"Vampire\"&gt;Vampire&lt;/a&gt;s are filthy creatures,\u201d said Nitrah. \u201cDisease-ridden, you know. They say off to the west, they'll indiscriminately pass on their curse together with a number of other afflictions. They don't do that here so much, but still you don't want to leave their wounds untreated. I take it you know something of the spells of &lt;a href=\"Restoration\"&gt;Restoration&lt;/a&gt; if one of us gets bit?\u201d\n\u201cI know a little, but I'm no &lt;a href=\"Healer\"&gt;Healer&lt;/a&gt;,\u201d said Massitha meekly. \u201cMore of a &lt;a href=\"Battlemage\"&gt;Battlemage&lt;/a&gt;?\u201d asked Osmic. \u201cI can do a little damage if I'm really close, but I'm not very good at that either. I'm more of an illusionist, technically.\u201d\nNitrah and Osmic looked at one another with naked concern as they reached the gates of the graveyard. There were moving shadows, stray specters among the wrack and ruins, crumbled paths stacked on top of crumbled paths. It wasn't a maze of a place; it could have been any dilapidated graveyard but even without looking at the tombstones, it did have one very noticeable feature. Filling the horizon was the mausoleum of a minor Cyrodilic official from the &lt;a href=\"2nd%20Era\"&gt;2nd Era&lt;/a&gt;, slightly exotic but still harmonizing with the &lt;a href=\"Dunmer\"&gt;Dunmer&lt;/a&gt; graves in a complimentary style called decay.\n\u201cIt's a surprisingly useful &lt;a href=\"Schools%20of%20Magic\"&gt;School&lt;/a&gt;,\u201d whispered Massitha defensively. \u201cYou see, it's all concerned with &lt;a href=\"magic\"&gt;magic&lt;/a&gt;ka's ability to &lt;a href=\"Alteration\"&gt;alter&lt;/a&gt; the perception of objects without changing their physical compositions. Removing sensual data, for example, to cast darkness or remove sound or smell from the air. It can help by--\u201d\nA red-haired &lt;a href=\"vampire\"&gt;vampire&lt;/a&gt; woman leapt out of the shadows in front of them, knocking Phlaxith on his back. Nitrah quickly unsheathed her sword, but Massitha was faster. With a wave of her hand, the creature stopped, frozen, her jaws scant inches from Phlaxith's throat. Phlaxith pulled out his own blade and finished her off. \u201cThat's &lt;a href=\"illusion\"&gt;illusion&lt;/a&gt;?\u201d asked Osmic. \u201cCertainly,\u201d smiled Massitha. \u201cNothing changed in the vampire's form, except its ability to move. Like I said, it's a very useful School.\u201d\nThe four climbed up over the paths to the front gateway to the crypt. Osmic snapped the lock and disassembled the poison trap. The sorceress cast a wave of light down the dust-choked corridors, banishing the shadows and drawing the inhabitants out. Almost immediately they were set on by a pair of vampires, howling and screaming in a frenzy of bloodlust.\nThe battle was joined, so no sooner were the first two vampires felled than their reinforcements attacked. They were mighty warriors of uncanny &lt;a href=\"strength\"&gt;strength&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"endurance\"&gt;endurance&lt;/a&gt;, but Massitha's &lt;a href=\"paralysis\"&gt;paralysis&lt;/a&gt; spell and the weaponry of Phlaxith and Nitrah clove through their ranks. Even Osmic aided the battle.\n\u201cThey're crazy,\u201d gasped Massitha when the fight finally ended and she could catch her breath. \u201c&lt;a href=\"Quarra\"&gt;Quarra&lt;/a&gt;, the most savage of the vampire bloodlines,\u201d said Phlaxith. \u201cWe have to find and exterminate each and every one.\u201d Delving into the crypts, the group hounded out more of the creatures. Though they varied in appearance, each seemed to rely on their strength and claws for attacking, and subtlety did not seem to be the style of any. When the entire mausoleum had been searched and every creature within destroyed, the four finally made their way to the surface. It was only an hour until sunrise.\nThere was no frenzied scream or howl. Nothing rushed forward towards them. The final attack when it happened was so unlike the others that the questors were taken utterly by surprise. The ancient creature waited until the four were almost out of the cemetery, talking amiably, making plans for spending their share of the reward. He judged carefully who would be the greatest threat, and then launched himself at the sorceress. Had Phlaxith not turned his attention back from the gate, she would have been ripped to shreds before she had a chance to scream.\nThe vampire knocked Massitha across a stone, its claws raking across her back, but stopped its assault in order to block a blow from Phlaxith's sword. It accomplished this maneuver in its own brutal way, by tearing the warrior's arm from its socket. Osmic and Nitrah set on it, but they found themselves in a losing battle. Only when Massitha had pulled herself back up from behind the pile of rocks, weak and bleeding, that the fight turned. She cast a magickal ball of flame at the creature, which so enraged it that it turned back to her. Nitrah saw her opening and took it, beheading the vampire with a stroke of her sword. \u201cSo you do know some spells of &lt;a href=\"destruction\"&gt;destruction&lt;/a&gt;, like you said,\u201d said Nitrah. \u201cAnd a few spells of healing too,\u201d she said weakly. \u201cBut I can't save Phlaxith.\u201d\nThe warrior died in the bloodied dust before them. The three were quiet as they traveled across the dawn-lit countryside back toward &lt;a href=\"Necrom\"&gt;Necrom&lt;/a&gt;. Massitha felt the throb of pain on her back intensify as they walked and then a gradual numbness like ice spread through her body. \u201cI need to go to a healer and see if I've been &lt;a href=\"disease\"&gt;disease&lt;/a&gt;d,\u201d she said as they reached the city. \u201cMeet us at the Moth and Fire tomorrow morning,\u201d said Nitrah. \u201cWe'll go to the Temple and get our reward and split it there.\u201d\nThree hours later, Osmic and Nitrah sat in their room at the tavern, happily counting and recounting the gold marks. Split three ways, it was a very comfortable sum. \u201cWhat if the healers can't do anything for Massitha?\u201d smiled Osmic dreamily. \u201cSome diseases can be insidious.\u201d\n\u201cDid you hear something in the hall?\u201d asked Nitrah quickly, but when she looked, there was no one there. She returned, shutting the door behind her. \u201cI'm sure Massitha will survive if she went straight to the healer. But we could leave tonight with the gold.\u201d\n\u201cLet's have one last drink to our poor sorceress,\u201d said Osmic, leading Nitrah out of the room toward the stairs down.\nNitrah laughed. \u201cThose spells of illusion won't help her track us down, as useful as she keeps saying they are. Paralysis, &lt;a href=\"light\"&gt;light&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"silence\"&gt;silence&lt;/a&gt; -- not so good when you don't know where to look.\u201d They closed the door behind them.\u201c&lt;a href=\"Invisibility\"&gt;Invisibility&lt;/a&gt; is another spell of illusion,\u201d said Massitha's disembodied voice. The gold on the table rose in the air and vanished from sight as she slipped it into her purse. The door again opened and closed, and all was silent until Osmic and Nitrah returned a few minutes later."}

A position well befitting your character, as it demands great cunning, grace, and, shall we say, a decided talent for performing one's duties tactfully and with much discretion.\nThe Jarl wasn't acting in his/her best interest by turning down my gracious offer. But you were able to see past his/her short-sightedness. In the end, I'm quite sure the Jarl will thank you for your cleverness in this matter.\nI am in your debt.

We're tracking one of the vile creatures along the coast to the west of &lt;a href=\"Alinor%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Alinor&lt;/a&gt;, near the vicinity of &lt;a href=\"Welenkin%20Cove\"&gt;Welenkin Cove&lt;/a&gt;.\nWe ran into a phenomenon that seemed to be not entirely natural in origin. A &lt;a href=\"Abyssal%20Geysers\"&gt;geyser&lt;/a&gt; sprang up, but instead of just spouting water, it also unleashed the terrible sea creatures that have been reported near &lt;a href=\"Shimmerene%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Shimmerene&lt;/a&gt; and other parts of the island, the &lt;a href=\"yaghra\"&gt;yaghra&lt;/a&gt;. Worse, there were also undead monstrosities among the unleashed horde.\nWe need to confirm my findings, but I have come to the conclusion that the yaghra and the undead have been set upon us by some sort of Sea Sload magic.\nAt the center of the strange geyser, we discovered one of the sea gems the &lt;a href=\"Sapiarchs\"&gt;Sapiarchs&lt;/a&gt; have named \"&lt;a href=\"Abyssal%20Pearl\"&gt;abyssal pearls&lt;/a&gt;.\" It radiated a foul magic that not only appeared to anchor the geyser, but seemed to serve as a lure of sorts for the yaghra. Upon destroying the pearl, the terrible event came to an abrupt end.\nWe tracked the Sea Sload to its hiding spot in Welenkin Cove. The creature called itself &lt;a href=\"B%27Korgen\"&gt;B'Korgen&lt;/a&gt; as it addressed its yaghra servants with a combination of its guttural verbal language and by speaking directly into their minds. If we got close enough, the mind magic seeped into our own heads. It was a strange and defiling experience.\nB'Korgen appeared to be tending to a bed of growing abyssal pearls. It drew strange sigils in the water around the pearls and even upon their lustrous surfaces, and added alchemical mixtures to the water that made the sea glow with an arcane light. I'm sure this is the source of each pearl's magic.\nA cloaked and hooded &lt;a href=\"Altmer%20%28Online%29\"&gt;High Elf&lt;/a&gt; paid a clandestine visit to the Sea Sload in Welenkin Cove while we made our observations. The figure spoke softly, but a few words reached us on the seaborne breeze. It seems that B'Korgen is one of a small number of Sea Sload currently active in Summerset's shadows. They call themselves \"the Abyssal Cabal\" and they appear to have partnered with a group of High Elves that calls itself \"the Court of Bedlam.\" The Battlereeve will want to find out more about this subversive group.\nFrom what I could glean of the conversation, the geysers are just part of a larger plan to wreck havoc across Summerset and eventually sink the island so the Sea Sload can reclaim it.\nI took a chance and slipped closer to try to get a better look at the sigils, the pearls, and the cloaked and hooded figure. B'Korgen is definitely combining magic and alchemy to alter the nature of the abyssal pearls. I wish I had more time to study the creature's techniques. I heard the Sea Sload tell the hooded figure not to worry. \"&lt;a href=\"K%27Tora\"&gt;K'Tora&lt;/a&gt; accomplished his role in the mission, and while his death is regrettable, it doesn't change the overall plan.\"\nThe hooded figure slipped away and Miriya and the Captain decided not to give chase. Better to return to Alinor with what we've learned and let the Battlereeve decide our next move.\nFrom what we've been able to learn, Summerset is not being invaded by an overwhelming force of &lt;a href=\"Sload\"&gt;Sload&lt;/a&gt;. Instead, a small cabal of Sea Sload\u2014what started out as four, now reduced to three due to the death of one called K'Tora\u2014has infiltrated the island in order to unleash the destructive abyssal geysers and hordes of yaghra and undead. And they appear to be working in conjunction with a group of High Elves that calls itself \"the Court of Bedlam.\"\nMarine Saruwy slipped on a wet stone and revealed our presence to the Sea Sload.

It drew strange sigils in the water around the pearls and even upon their lustrous surfaces, and added alchemical mixtures to the water that made the sea glow with an arcane light.

He was a champion of &lt;a href=\"Azura\"&gt;Azura&lt;/a&gt; and the first &lt;a href=\"Hortator\"&gt;Hortator&lt;/a&gt;, or war-leader/champion, of the unified Chimer and &lt;a href=\"Dwemer\"&gt;Dwemer&lt;/a&gt;, following the overthrowing of the &lt;a href=\"Nordic%20Empire\"&gt;Nordic Empire&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Resdayn\"&gt;Resdayn&lt;/a&gt;. However, after the discovery that the Dwemer were creating the &lt;a href=\"Numidium\"&gt;Numidium&lt;/a&gt;, he led his people against them in the &lt;a href=\"War%20of%20the%20First%20Council\"&gt;War of the First Council&lt;/a&gt;. Nerevar died at &lt;a href=\"Red%20Mountain\"&gt;Red Mountain&lt;/a&gt;, though the exact cause is disputed. Later, he became a &lt;a href=\"saint\"&gt;saint&lt;/a&gt; of the &lt;a href=\"Dunmer\"&gt;Dunmer&lt;/a&gt;'s &lt;a href=\"Tribunal%20Temple\"&gt;Tribunal Temple&lt;/a&gt;.\nNerevar played a crucial role in &lt;a href=\"Morrowind\"&gt;Morrowind&lt;/a&gt;'s history. The &lt;a href=\"Ashlanders\"&gt;Ashlanders&lt;/a&gt; and an underground offshoot of the Tribunal Temple, known as the &lt;a href=\"Dissident%20Priests\"&gt;Dissident Priests&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"Vvardenfell\"&gt;Vvardenfell&lt;/a&gt;, believed that he was reincarnated &lt;a href=\"Failed%20Incarnate\"&gt;multiple times&lt;/a&gt; as part of the &lt;a href=\"Nerevarine%20Prophecy\"&gt;Nerevarine Prophecy&lt;/a&gt;. This prophecy was fulfilled by &lt;a href=\"Nerevarine\"&gt;the hero&lt;/a&gt; of .\nLegendary origins.\nNerevar's early life is shrouded in mystery. Vivec's sermons indicate he was, at one point, a guard for a merchant caravan, but the accuracy of his prose is somewhat debatable. When the &lt;a href=\"War%20of%20Succession\"&gt;War of Succession&lt;/a&gt; ravaged the &lt;a href=\"Nordic%20Empire\"&gt;Nordic Empire&lt;/a&gt;, Nerevar seized the opportunity to incite a rebellion in &lt;a href=\"Resdayn\"&gt;Resdayn&lt;/a&gt;. Nerevar united the disparate &lt;a href=\"Chimer\"&gt;Chimer&lt;/a&gt; clans, and was proclaimed as Hortator, whereupon he forged &lt;a href=\"First%20Council\"&gt;an unlikely alliance&lt;/a&gt; with the &lt;a href=\"Dwemer\"&gt;Dwemer&lt;/a&gt;, thanks in part to his burgeoning friendship with the Dwemer king, &lt;a href=\"Dumac\"&gt;Dumac&lt;/a&gt;. Together, the alliance drove the Nords from Morrowind, attaining the Chimer's independence.\nSome time after, Nerevar married &lt;a href=\"Almalexia\"&gt;Almalexia&lt;/a&gt;, and maintained close relationships with several people amidst his retinue, such as his advisors &lt;a href=\"Sotha%20Sil\"&gt;Sotha Sil&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Vivec\"&gt;Vivec&lt;/a&gt;, his shield-bearer &lt;a href=\"Alandro%20Sul\"&gt;Alandro Sul&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Voryn%20Dagoth\"&gt;Voryn Dagoth&lt;/a&gt; the Lord High Councilor of &lt;a href=\"House%20Dagoth\"&gt;House Dagoth&lt;/a&gt; (and, by some accounts, Nerevar's most loyal servant). Centuries later, Dagoth learned that the chief Dwemer scientist, &lt;a href=\"Kagrenac\"&gt;Kagrenac&lt;/a&gt;, had discovered the &lt;a href=\"Heart%20of%20Lorkhan\"&gt;Heart of Lorkhan&lt;/a&gt; beneath &lt;a href=\"Red%20Mountain\"&gt;Red Mountain&lt;/a&gt;, and intended to use it for &lt;a href=\"Numidium\"&gt;unclear apotheotic purposes&lt;/a&gt;, something the Chimer considered blasphemous. For one reason or another, when Nerevar confronted Dumac about Kagrenac's plans, their friendship swiftly crumbled. This resulted in the &lt;a href=\"War%20of%20the%20First%20Council\"&gt;War of the First Council&lt;/a&gt;, culminating with the &lt;a href=\"Battle%20of%20Red%20Mountain\"&gt;Battle of Red Mountain&lt;/a&gt;, wherein the Dwemer race mysteriously disappeared forever.\nAccording to official Temple accounts, Nerevar fell after the death of Dumac. In some accounts, however, the death of Nerevar is not attributed to wounds he received during the Battle. After the Battle, Nerevar and Voryn Dagoth proceeded into the center of the Dwemer stronghold, where they discovered the &lt;a href=\"Heart%20of%20Lorkhan\"&gt;Heart of Lorkhan&lt;/a&gt;, as well as Kagrenac's Tools: &lt;a href=\"Keening\"&gt;Keening&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Sunder\"&gt;Sunder&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Wraithguard\"&gt;Wraithguard&lt;/a&gt;. Nerevar commanded Voryn to guard the tools, as he went back to his advisors for instruction on what to do next. When he reached his advisors, he conferred with them for some time. They decided to leave the tools alone, and made a vow to &lt;a href=\"Azura\"&gt;Azura&lt;/a&gt;. The official account says that Nerevar went to Voryn Dagoth to retrieve the tools, but Dagoth had been driven mad by the power of the Heart of Lorkhan in Nerevar's absence, and refused to relinquish the tools. Nerevar fought with Dagoth Ur, and defeated him. Unfortunately, Nerevar was mortally wounded, and only survived long enough for his advisors to find him, and for him to make them swear to never use the tools. Unfortunately, they eventually used the tools to turn themselves into gods, and when they did, Azura appeared and cursed the entire Chimer race by \"turning their eyes to fire and their skin to ash,\" making them into the Dunmer.\nIn &lt;a href=\"Ashlanders%20%28Morrowind%29\"&gt;Ashlanders&lt;/a&gt; texts, however, Nerevar was not killed in combat, but by his three advisors, &lt;a href=\"Vivec\"&gt;Vivec&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Almalexia\"&gt;Almalexia&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Sotha%20Sil\"&gt;Sotha Sil&lt;/a&gt;. In this account, Nerevar made them swear to never use the tools, and they obeyed, but secretly conspired to murder Nerevar so that they might gain power. When attempting to summon Azura, Nerevar was foiled; Almalexia used poisoned candles, Sotha Sil used poisoned robes, and Vivec used poisoned invocations. Nerevar was killed. In retribution for their betrayal, Azura turned the skin of the Chimer gray, and their eyes fiery red, making the Chimer people into what is now known as the &lt;a href=\"Dunmer\"&gt;Dunmer&lt;/a&gt;. However, the &lt;a href=\"Tribunal\"&gt;Tribunal&lt;/a&gt; went on to use the power of the tools and the Heart to become immortal. Afterwards, they set themselves up as the new gods of the Dunmer, claiming superior divinity to the &lt;a href=\"Daedra\"&gt;Daedra&lt;/a&gt;, whom the Chimer had self-exiled for the worship of. Eventually, their &lt;a href=\"Tribunal%20Temple\"&gt;Tribunal Temple&lt;/a&gt; took control of all of Morrowind, becoming the monolithic and seemingly infallible entity it was by the end of the &lt;a href=\"Third%20Era\"&gt;Third Era&lt;/a&gt;, and leaving only isolated pockets of Ashlanders to maintain the old beliefs.\nAfter his demise, Nerevar apparently rose from the dead as a &lt;a href=\"Bonewalker%20%28Morrowind%29\"&gt;bonewalker&lt;/a&gt;, something which the Tribunal was evidently aware of. It is unknown what eventually became of him afterwards.\nSainthood.\nNerevar became a martyr and a &lt;a href=\"saint\"&gt;saint&lt;/a&gt; of the Tribunal Temple. According to a traditional myth, Saint Nerevar helped Baranat during his trials against the Coribael brothers. &lt;a href=\"Shrines%20%28Morrowind%29\"&gt;Shrines&lt;/a&gt; dedicated to him can be found across Vvardenfell inside temples, such as the &lt;a href=\"High%20Fane\"&gt;High Fane&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Vivec%20City\"&gt;Vivec City&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"Ghostgate%20Temple\"&gt;Ghostgate Temple&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;a href=\"Ashlands\"&gt;Ashlands&lt;/a&gt;, or the &lt;a href=\"Holamayan%20Monastery\"&gt;Holamayan Monastery&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;a href=\"Azura%27s%20Coast\"&gt;Azura's Coast&lt;/a&gt; region.\nArtifacts.\nDuring his lifetime, Nerevar made use of a number different artifacts. Some of them were obtained by the &lt;a href=\"Nerevarine\"&gt;Nerevarine&lt;/a&gt;, the Hortator's true incarnation. The fate of the others is unknown.\nTrueflame.\nAfter the &lt;a href=\"Nordic%20Empire\"&gt;Nordic Empire&lt;/a&gt;'s occupation of &lt;a href=\"Resdayn\"&gt;Resdayn&lt;/a&gt; came to an end, &lt;a href=\"Dumac\"&gt;Dwarf-King Dumac&lt;/a&gt; and Nerevar had become blood friends. On the day of Nerevar and &lt;a href=\"Almalexia\"&gt;Almalexia&lt;/a&gt;'s wedding, Dumac presented them with powerfully enchanted twin blades, Trueflame and &lt;a href=\"Hopesfire\"&gt;Hopesfire&lt;/a&gt;. During the &lt;a href=\"Battle%20of%20Red%20Mountain\"&gt;Battle of Red Mountain&lt;/a&gt;, Trueflame was lost, its flame extinguished, and its pieces lost in the confusion. A blade by the name of &lt;a href=\"Trueflame\"&gt;Trueflame&lt;/a&gt; may have been obtained by the &lt;a href=\"Vestige\"&gt;Vestige&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;a href=\"Stonefalls\"&gt;Stonefalls&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"2E%20582\"&gt;2E 582&lt;/a&gt;, but it was oddly intact. After &lt;a href=\"Dagoth%20Ur%20%28Character%29\"&gt;Dagoth Ur&lt;/a&gt;'s defeat in &lt;a href=\"3E%20427\"&gt;3E 427&lt;/a&gt;, Almalexia tasked the Nerevarine with reforging Trueflame. With the help of &lt;a href=\"Radac%20Stungnthumz\"&gt;Radac Stungnthumz&lt;/a&gt;, the blade was restored to its former glory.\nMoon-and-Star.\nOne-Clan-Under-Moon-and-Star was a ring Nerevar obtained from a &lt;a href=\"Dwemer\"&gt;Dwemer&lt;/a&gt; smithy during the Nordic Empire's occupation of Resdayn. The Dwemer smith gave him the ring imbued with the power of persuasion, and as a safeguard, enchanted it so that anyone that wore it who was not Nerevar would instantly die. Nerevar used the ring to unite the various clans into the &lt;a href=\"First%20Council\"&gt;First Council&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href=\"Azura\"&gt;Azura&lt;/a&gt; later gave the ring to the Nerevarine in the &lt;a href=\"Cavern%20of%20the%20Incarnate%20%28Morrowind%29\"&gt;Cavern of the Incarnate&lt;/a&gt;.\nEthos Knife.\nThe Ethos Knife is a unique knife with little information. &lt;a href=\"Vivec\"&gt;Vivec&lt;/a&gt; originally used it to murder his child &lt;a href=\"Muatra%23City-Face\"&gt;City-Face&lt;/a&gt;. Nerevar later traded his axe for the knife, and took it with him to the Battle of Red Mountain. He may have used it to kill Dumac in their duel. The Knife's current whereabouts are unknown.\nNerevar's Axe.\nIn the Temple of False Thinking of &lt;a href=\"Mournhold\"&gt;Mournhold&lt;/a&gt;, Nerevar chose an axe from the fight racks, and traveled to the &lt;a href=\"Masser\"&gt;first moon&lt;/a&gt; to fight empty graves, making the mistake of taking Vivec's advice to \"reach heaven by violence\" literally. He later traded his axe for the Ethos Knife. The fate of the axe after the battle is unknown. Despite Nerevar giving it a name, the true name of the axe is never mentioned.\nNerevarine.\nThe true Nerevarine was the incarnate of Nerevar and a hero who successfully completed the &lt;a href=\"Nerevarine%20Prophecy\"&gt;Nerevarine Prophecy&lt;/a&gt;, saved Morrowind from the &lt;a href=\"Blight\"&gt;Blight&lt;/a&gt; and defeated Dagoth Ur.\nFailed Incarnates.\nFailed Incarnates were individuals who had potential to become the true Nerevarine but failed to complete the prophecy.

Once Seran is dead (or the pair have been left to their romance), the Nerevarine may return to Deldrise.\nDelight and Despair.\nDeldrise Andoren will react differently depending on how far the Nerevarine took their task. Simply witnessing the meeting will see Deldrise reward them with 250 , although if the Nerevarine is spotted by her husband then she will give them nothing. Should Seran have been removed from the picture, however, then Deldrise will be overjoyed, rewarding the Nerevarine 1,000 instead. But, if Taren Andoren was also killed, then the Nerevarine will, once again, receive nothing."}

Talking to Stalleo will cause him to inform the Dragonborn of his predicament and ask for help in gaining access to the fort.\n\"Are you here to help?\"\nWhat's going on? \"Finally, reinforcements have arrived. I was expecting more though, you'd better be good.\"\nApproaching and talking to Stalleo again will allow the Dragonborn to ask another different question about Brurid.\nBrurid? \"He's a rogue mage who defected at the beginning of the war. I turned him in but apparently he escaped and now this.\"\nIt is possible to enter the fort by simply jumping on the rocks it is built into, without having to start the quest to enter the fort and kill the bandits within. However, this does not affect the quest and it can still be accepted. In other words, bandits located inside the fort have no connection to the quest and the quest can still be completed after &lt;a href=\"Treva%27s%20Watch\"&gt;Treva's Watch&lt;/a&gt; has been cleared.\nUpon receiving the quest from &lt;a href=\"Stalleo\"&gt;Stalleo&lt;/a&gt;, the Dragonborn will be asked to enter the escape tunnel. When inside, there is a staircase with three bandits stationed at the top and a fourth to the right. The quickest way to kill these is to use the &lt;a href=\"Unrelenting%20Force%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Unrelenting Force&lt;/a&gt; shout on the three enemies at the top of the staircase into an explosive pot hanging from the ceiling. This will spread oil all over the floor at the top of the stairs, and the Dragonborn simply sets fire to the oil, thus making the bandits catch fire. Note that there is an area to the right of the stairs with two chests.\nContinue following the tunnel and be wary of the bear trap awaiting upon leaving the area just fought in. After climbing another flight of stairs, the Dragonborn will find a bandit hammering away at an anvil. If the Dragonborn is of a high enough level, he or she should sneak up on the bandit and backstab him (which should result in a one hit kill). If interested in &lt;a href=\"Smithing%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;smithing&lt;/a&gt;, note that there are iron ingots directly opposite the anvil.\nIn the other room in this area, there are two dead Nords and an Imperial Soldier. As an aside; they are suspected to be Stalleo's family but this is never confirmed. After completing the quest, Stalleo asks \"Did you see my family inside?,\" to which the only reply available is \"No, I didn't.\" Stalleo then states that he will take a short respite before continuing \"the search.\"\nEnter through the door in the area and continue forwards up yet another staircase. Be wary of the two bear traps directly after entering the new corridor, as activating either trap will alert the two bandits at the top of the stairs. However, if quick enough, the Dragonborn can activate these once again and simply wait for the first bandit to die by standing on them. Quickly kill the second bandit and continue on.\nThe next area is full of bandits (seven to be exact) which includes the bandit chief, who has a battleaxe of some sort. Either try to avoid the chief's lunges and make quick work of the other bandits in there before targeting the chief, or kill him first before the other enemies. Once all the bandits have been killed, pick the lock of the door (adept) in front of the sleeping quarters and search the chest in there. After this, follow the tunnel around once more. Note that there is a bookshelf of various weapons and armor before turning right in the tunnel. After turning right, enter the room on the left to find a &lt;a href=\"Bound%20Sword%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Bound Sword&lt;/a&gt; spell tome.\nHead through the dining area and follow the tunnel around to a closed wooden door. Open it and turn left. Be wary of the &lt;a href=\"Traps%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;trap&lt;/a&gt; on the floor that activates a spike filled gate to swing round the corner.\nOnce again, follow the tunnel and one will soon come to a large staircase to the right and another tunnel that continues onwards. The Dragonborn can either take the forward tunnel and clear out the dungeon to the left before taking the staircase to avoid being attacked from behind or just climb the staircase killing the enemies along the way and search the room at the top to find a &lt;a href=\"Courage\"&gt;Courage&lt;/a&gt; spell tome and a &lt;a href=\"Twin%20Secrets\"&gt;Twin Secrets&lt;/a&gt; skill book. Whichever method chosen, the tunnel leads to the way out. However, before exiting to Skyrim, note that there is a chest at the far end of this tunnel but be wary of two traps along the way.\nDepending on whether or not the Dragonborn has cleared out the fort before activating the quest, they will either have several enemies to kill or they will simply just be able to activate the lever directly in front when leaving the tunnels.

He is still trying to bring honor to the Guild while also bringing down the &lt;a href=\"Blackwood%20Company\"&gt;Blackwood Company&lt;/a&gt;.\nWalkthrough.\nOreyn explains that the Blackwood Company has expanded into the region, and has a new hideout in &lt;a href=\"Glademist%20Cave\"&gt;Glademist Cave&lt;/a&gt;. One of the Blackwood Company leaders, &lt;a href=\"Ajum-Kajin\"&gt;Ajum-Kajin&lt;/a&gt;, is there. Oreyn would like the Hero to go capture him and bring him in for questioning.\nFollow the quest marker to &lt;a href=\"Glademist%20Cave\"&gt;Glademist Cave&lt;/a&gt;. The Hero may want to lighten their load as The Blackwood Company is equipped with the best light and heavy armor, unlike the Fighters Guild iron armor.\nThere will be almost a dozen Blackwood Company Guards that are posted in groups of two. Defeat the pairs, and continue following the quest marker to find Ajum-Kajin. Talk to him, and he will follow back to Chorrol. He is not an essential character, but if he gets damaged he will run away quickly while casting heal on himself, and return when it's safe.\nBring him back to Chorrol. Upon speaking to Oreyn, he will tell the Hero to interrogate him and get him to give all the details about the Blackwood Company.\nGo back to Ajum-Kajin. Tell him to sit down, and start talking to him. He will say that they do not scare him, and he will not tell them anything. There are two ways to get him to talk. Torture him or persuade him (by playing the persuasion game, or by bribing him).\nIf choosing to torture him, unequip weapons and start beating him with fists (be careful, as he can be killed). He needs to get down to 60% health for him to talk the first time, then 20% the second.\nIf choosing to persuade him, get his disposition to 70. The Hero will get a quest update that he is ready to divulge some information when leaving the dialogue mode. Talk to him again, and ask him how many members there are. He will say over a hundred. Continue the conversation, and attempt to ask him who the leader is. He will say that he will not betray him. Ask where the Blackwood Company gets its strength, and he will again say that he won't tell you.\nContinue to beat on him, or get his disposition to 90 (a charm spell helps here or he could be bribed) until the Hero gets another quest update. Now ask him who the leader is. He will say that the leader's name is &lt;a href=\"Ri%27Zakar\"&gt;Ri'Zakar&lt;/a&gt;. Ask him where the Blackwood Company gets its strength, and he will say he'd rather die. The conversation exits, and he bursts into flames. He had a hidden &lt;a href=\"Blackwood%20Ring%20of%20Silence\"&gt;Blackwood Ring of Silence&lt;/a&gt;, and equipped it instead of divulging this information. Note that the ring does not appear in his inventory prior to questioning, so it cannot be stolen to prevent the suicide.\nGo speak to Oreyn. He says it is unfortunate that he killed himself, however the information that was needed was obtained. He rewards the Hero with the &lt;a href=\"Amulet%20of%20Interrogation\"&gt;Amulet of Interrogation&lt;/a&gt; and the quest completes."}

The Count has information on the Necromancer activity in &lt;a href=\"Cyrodiil\"&gt;Cyrodiil&lt;/a&gt;. Before he gives that information, he wants a favor performed. It appears that a nest of &lt;a href=\"Vampire%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;vampires&lt;/a&gt; and a group of &lt;a href=\"vampire%20hunters\"&gt;vampire hunters&lt;/a&gt; need to be removed from the area. The vampires are found in &lt;a href=\"Bloodcrust%20Cavern\"&gt;Bloodcrust Cavern&lt;/a&gt; while the vampire hunters are at the &lt;a href=\"Two%20Sisters%20Lodge\"&gt;Two Sisters Lodge&lt;/a&gt; in Skingrad. They can also be found wandering the streets of Skingrad. There are mutiple ways to proceed with the quest.\nMethod One.\nHead to Bloodcrust Cavern and fight the vampires. Once the last one is dead and some &lt;a href=\"Vampire%20Dust%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;vampire dust&lt;/a&gt; has been collected, the vampire hunters need to be dealt with. Head to the Two Sisters Lodge and speak to &lt;a href=\"Eridor\"&gt;Eridor&lt;/a&gt;, who is their leader. Inform him of the vampire's demise and show him the dust as evidence. With this, they will leave town.\nMethod Two.\nInstead of speaking to Eridor and his group of vampire hunters, wait until they fall asleep (after midnight) and kill them in their rooms. Once all four are dead an updated journal entry shows that the group has been dealt with. This method is more dangerous, as the Count refuses to have the &lt;a href=\"City%20Guard%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;city guard&lt;/a&gt; look the other way if &lt;a href=\"Crime%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;crimes&lt;/a&gt; are committed during this mission. The &lt;a href=\"Gray%20Cowl%20of%20Nocturnal%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;Gray Cowl of Nocturnal&lt;/a&gt; helps with eliminating the hunters. Once they are dead, head to Bloodcrust Cavern and slay the vampires.\nMethod Three.\nGo to the vampire hunters and tell them where the vampires are. They will head to the cavern themselves and take out the vampires. Let the two groups fight it out. If the vampire hunters win, they'll leave town in a few days. Otherwise, head to the cavern and clear the mess up (should be a few stray vampires remain). If the vampire hunters were successful, head to the caverns anyway.\nNote that at higher levels the vampires will greatly outclass the vampire hunters, and often the hunters will all be killed while only killing one or two vampires, and in some cases none at all.\u00a0\nBack to Count Hassildor.\nOnce the vampires are dead and the vampire Hunters gone, head back to the castle and speak to Hal-Liurz. Once the Count arrives, inform him of the victory. Then, he gives the information as promised:\u00a0&lt;a href=\"Mannimarco%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;Mannimarco&lt;/a&gt;\u00a0has returned to Cyrodiil. Head back to the University and speak to Hannibal Traven about Mannimarco and the quest is done. Three days must pass before another quest can be performed for Traven."}

Vuhon and &lt;a href=\"Ezhmaar%20Sul\"&gt;Ezhmaar Sul&lt;/a&gt; made a deal with Daedric Prince &lt;a href=\"Clavicus%20Vile\"&gt;Clavicus Vile&lt;/a&gt;, which resulted in creation of the Ingenium to keep the Ministry of Truth floating. In order to work properly, the Ingenium needed mortal souls. Firstly, only the souls of criminals and outlaws were used to run the Ingenium. The Ingenium consumed around ten souls per day. Eventually, Vuhon found out that appropriate souls could power the Ingenium for months.\nThe Ingenium was operated for five years since Vivec's disappearance during the &lt;a href=\"Oblivion%20Crisis\"&gt;Oblivion Crisis&lt;/a&gt;. Ezhmaar Sul's wife, &lt;a href=\"Ilzheven\"&gt;Ilzheven&lt;/a&gt;, was chosen to be one of the sacrificed because she had the right sort of soul. Sul tried to rescue her, but the following fight between him and Vuhon damaged the Ingenium, and without anything to keep it in the sky, the Ministry of Truth crashed into Vivec City. It is widely believed that this is the direct cause of the events of &lt;a href=\"Red%20Year\"&gt;Red Year&lt;/a&gt;.

The &lt;a href=\"The%20Agent\"&gt;Agent&lt;/a&gt; is offered the chance to improve their standing with the Mages Guild, by venturing into a &lt;a href=\"Dungeons%20%28Daggerfall%29\"&gt;dungeon&lt;/a&gt; to retrieve an &lt;a href=\"Ingredients%20%28Daggerfall%29\"&gt;ingredient&lt;/a&gt;.\nBackground.\nAfter escaping from &lt;a href=\"Privateer%27s%20Hold%20%28Quest%29\"&gt;Privateer's Hold&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"The%20Agent\"&gt;Agent&lt;/a&gt; may wish to enhance their reputation within one of the major organisations of the &lt;a href=\"Iliac%20Bay\"&gt;Iliac Bay&lt;/a&gt;: The &lt;a href=\"Mages%20Guild%20%28Daggerfall%29\"&gt;Mages Guild&lt;/a&gt;.

The Guildhall requires a specific &lt;a href=\"Ingredients%20%28Daggerfall%29\"&gt;ingredient&lt;/a&gt; to complete some research, yet only one sample is (apparently) known to exist. Should the Agent be willing to forgo a fee for getting the ingredient, the Guildmagister will \"put in a good word\" for the Agent.\nA Commonly Difficult Ingredient.\nAlthough the ingredient may seem mundane, the specific sample the Guildmagister wants is to be found in one of the &lt;a href=\"Iliac%20Bay\"&gt;Iliac Bay's&lt;/a&gt; many &lt;a href=\"Dungeons%20%28Daggerfall%29\"&gt;dungeons&lt;/a&gt;.

Regardless of foes, the Agent must find the targeted ingredient.\nOnce the ingredient has been picked up, the Agent must return to the Guildmagister, with the item in their inventory, before the time limit expires.\nRewards.\nThe Agent has a one in three chance of receiving a &lt;a href=\"Map%20%28Daggerfall%29\"&gt;map&lt;/a&gt; from the Guildmagister for their efforts, alongside the boost to their reputation within the Guild. The penalties for failing the quest are relatively high by comparison, but will also see gains among some anti-Mage Guild factions:"}

With her brother &lt;a href=\"Sibbi%20Black-Briar%20%28Character%29\"&gt;Sibbi&lt;/a&gt;, Ingun lives with her father &lt;a href=\"Hemming%20Black-Briar\"&gt;Hemming&lt;/a&gt; and mother &lt;a href=\"Maven%20Black-Briar\"&gt;Maven&lt;/a&gt;. Currently, she studies &lt;a href=\"Alchemy%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;alchemy&lt;/a&gt; and is working at &lt;a href=\"Elgrim%27s%20Elixirs\"&gt;Elgrim's Elixirs&lt;/a&gt;, where she serves as an apprentice to &lt;a href=\"Elgrim\"&gt;Elgrim&lt;/a&gt;.\nPersonality.\nAlthough she is much more eloquent and polite than the rest of the Black-Briars, Ingun shows her sinister side when talking about her experiments on animals. She says she is fascinated by alchemy because of the irony; the irony that the same world that gave life provides the means to die. She spends nearly every day in the shop training in alchemy, only returning &lt;a href=\"Black-Briar%20Manor\"&gt;home&lt;/a&gt; to sleep and eat meals. Mjoll the Lioness, an ardent opponent of the Black-Briars, views Ingun as a \"strange girl\" but doesn't seem to dislike her.\nIngun dislikes her family. According to her, \"all that wealth has been squandered on foolish ventures and political schemes.\" She feels that she was meant for much more, and wishes to pledge her life and ply her talents in darker circles. She ends conversations with, \"If only &lt;a href=\"Maven%20Black-Briar\"&gt;my mother&lt;/a&gt; would let me, I would make her proud.\"\nWhen asked if Ingun is an alchemist, Ingun replies \"I'm aspiring to earn that title, yes.\" According to Ingun, Master Elgrim says she's a natural; that she has a unique talent, but fears Elgrim's approval masks his intolerance for her mistakes.\nInteractions.\n&lt;a href=\"Few%20and%20Far%20Between\"&gt;Few and Far Between&lt;/a&gt;.\nIngun says her mistakes have wasted hard-to-get ingredients. The &lt;a href=\"Last%20Dragonborn\"&gt;Dragonborn&lt;/a&gt; can complete &lt;a href=\"Ingun%27s%20Task\"&gt;Ingun's Task&lt;/a&gt; for her. The task entails collecting twenty &lt;a href=\"Nirnroot%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;nirnroot&lt;/a&gt;, twenty &lt;a href=\"Nightshade%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;nightshade&lt;/a&gt;, and twenty &lt;a href=\"Deathbell%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;deathbell&lt;/a&gt;. She pays 750\u00a0 for these &lt;a href=\"Ingredients%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;ingredients&lt;/a&gt;. When she is reminded \"that was the last of the ingredients,\" she will hand over\u00a0a key to access to her supply chest where she stores her creations, located in the back room of the apothecary that doubles as the home of her master and his wife. She will restock the chest in the back of &lt;a href=\"Elgrim%27s%20Elixirs\"&gt;Elgrim's Elixirs&lt;/a&gt; every few days.\nConversations.\nElgrim.\nIngun Black-Briar: \"I don't understand, Elgrim. The formulas you're giving me are for novices but I've advanced well passed that point.\"\nElgrim: \"Until you can do those formulas with your eyes shut, you'll never be ready to master the more difficult ones.\"\nIngun Black-Briar: \"This is an utter waste of time.\"\nElgrim: \"Ingun! If you want to remain in my shop as an apprentice I expect you to act like one. No exceptions!\"\nIngun Black-Briar: \"Very well, I'll keep practicing them.\"\nElgrim: \"Ingun, you clumsy fool! You've tainted our entire supply of Painted Troll Fat. You have no idea how hard that was to get.\"\nIngun Black-Briar: \"I'm sure my mother can compensate you for it.\"\nElgrim: \"I'll draft a letter to Rythe. If you could have it sent to Cheydinhal for me, that would make up for your blunder.\"\nIngun Black-Briar: \"I'll make sure it's sent right away.\"\nMaven Black-Briar.\nMaven Black-Briar: \"Ingun, how much longer do you intend to waste your life concocting your foolish little potions?\"\nIngun Black-Briar: \"I've told you, my interest in the family business is quite low. I wish to be much more than just a merchant.\"\nMaven Black-Briar: \"Your interests lay where I wish them to lay otherwise my favorite daughter may end up homeless and without a septim to her name. Is that clear?\"\nIngun Black-Briar: \"Yes, mother.\""}
