Renoit Leonciele and his husband Draven seek whatever cure the village offers, though they don't know what the cost may be.\"\nWalkthrough.\nWhen approaching &lt;a href=\"Kerbol%27s%20Hollow\"&gt;Kerbol's Hollow&lt;/a&gt;, you will find a man named &lt;a href=\"Renoit%20Leonciele\"&gt;Renoit Leonciele&lt;/a&gt;. He will tell you that there is a magical hidden village here where all sickness can be cured, and that his husband &lt;a href=\"Draven%20Leonciele\"&gt;Draven Leonciele&lt;/a&gt; went in about a week ago looking for a cure. He will ask you to go into the village and check on his husband, and will direct you to the guard guarding the cave. \nHead south to the cave entrance and speak with the guard &lt;a href=\"Marcellyne%20Cine\"&gt;Marcellyne Cine&lt;/a&gt;, and she will let you through. Head through to the village; in the town square, you will find the mayor &lt;a href=\"Arienne%20Kerbol\"&gt;Arienne Kerbol&lt;/a&gt;. Speak with her and she will tell you that Renoit may join Draven in the village now, but that Draven may never leave the village. She will direct you to the guesthouse if you wish to speak with Draven. Head there and speak with the man; he will tell you that he is getting better but will refuse to elaborate on how he is being cured. After this conversation, Renoit will come in and voice his suspicions that this village is some kind of cult. Speak with him and he will ask you to help him investigate what is going on in this village. \nHead outside and talk to a villager. They will tell you nothing. Keep searching and you will find a robe in a laundry basket; this will be important later on. Continue to look around and you will find \"&lt;a href=\"The%20Book%20of%20Reason\"&gt;The Book of Reason&lt;/a&gt;\" on a stand next to &lt;a href=\"Farelle%20Falbert\"&gt;Farelle Falbert&lt;/a&gt;, in the south of town. The book will tell you that the residents here stay healthy by keeping to the village and reciting a strange incantation. Confront a villager with this knowledge and they will direct you to &lt;a href=\"Helene%20Danise\"&gt;Helene Danise&lt;/a&gt;, on the lower floor of Kerbol's House. Head there and you will find her locked in a cell. She is struggling to resist a werewolf transformation. After you have spoken with her, head back to Renoit outside the guest house. \nRenoit will tell you that they have just taken away Draven for his initiation rites. They did not allow Renoit to join because \"they were out of spare robes;\" Renoit will ask you to head to the ritual site and stop the rites before it is too late. The ritual site is east of town; put on your robes when you get there and wait for the ritual to begin. Once Arienne starts casting her spell, head up to Draven and destroy the magic bindings she placed on him. Draven will transform into a werewolf and head off. Speak with Arienne after this and she will admit that everyone in this town is in fact a werewolf, and that they were trying to seal away Draven's wolf form. \nYour task now is to subdue Draven so that the ritual can still be completed. Head up the path and you will find a dead deer; Draven will attack you the moment you examine it. Defeat him and subdue him, then head back to the village and tell Renoit everything. He will be worried about what all of this means, and that he thinks Arienne has a lot of explaining to do. After this conversation, Arienne will tell Renoit to bring Draven to the town so that they may complete the ritual and will ask you to meet with her in the town hall. \nIn the hall, Arienne will tell you that it is now up to you to talk Draven into completing the ritual, as Draven will no longer trust her. Once you are done talking, Renoit and Draven will come in; speak with Draven and he will tell you what Kerbol was doing to him during the ritual. He felt like she was cutting out a part of his mind. He does not want this ritual; you can now either choose to help him stay a werewolf or you can help Arienne perform her ritual. If you help Arienne, . If you agree to help Draven, head outside and talk to Renoit there.\nRenoit will ask you to help break the spell Arienne has cast on everyone in this town. He noticed that the gate on the southeast side of town was guarded last time he was there, but that it's unguarded now. He suspects Arienne is hiding something in the cave beyond, and will ask you to investigate. You will find a talisman there; destroy it and head up the path. You will find a transformed Arienne Kerbol at the shrine there there, who will be hostile. Kill her, then meet Renoit and Draven down the cliff. Speak with Renoit there to finish the quest."}

She stared so long at Makes-Many-Waves that she drew the &lt;a href=\"Argonians%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Argonian&lt;/a&gt;'s eyes to hers. They both looked away quickly, almost instantly. Eye contact between master and &lt;a href=\"slave\"&gt;slave&lt;/a&gt; would be punished by ten lashes.\nThe distance between market and house was no more than seven miles, but it seemed an eternity to Sendrasa. She'd counted the years impatiently until she could set up her own household and bring Makes-Many-Waves home.\n\"Send the rest to the field house,\" Sendrasa said. Her footman assisted her from her horse. \"I want that one,\" she waved a hand towards Makes-Many-Waves, \"brought to my sitting room. She'll be my personal assistant.\"\n\"As you wish, madam.\"\nPulling her gloves off as she strode into her home, Sendrasa laughed. \"Finally, yes! It will be exactly as I wish.\"\nHow long since she'd felt her lover's lips pressed against hers? Shared in desperate, guilty caresses whenever they could steal away together? How she'd suffered once their intimacy became known! As though, Sendrasa thought bitterly, seeing her beloved sold through the &lt;a href=\"Archein\"&gt;Archein&lt;/a&gt;s hadn't been punishment enough.\nTime passed with deadly slowness from that moment until Sendrasa finally located Makes-Many-Waves and bought her back. This time, no one could separate them. They belonged together.\nThe door opened, and Makes-Many-Waves stepped forward, eyes downcast becomingly. Sendrasa walked past her, shut and locked the door, then turned.\n\"I've missed you,\" she said softly.\nIn a moment, they locked in a passionate embrace, Sendrasa touching Makes-Many-Waves's scales gently, searchingly.\n\"Did they torture you, darling? I swear they'll pay!\"\nMakes-Many-Waves shook her head, her frilled spine fluttering. \"Seeing you heals me, my love. But the Archeins \u2026.\"\n\"You're safe. Those traitors won't touch you again,\" Sendrasa said.\n\"Listen, my love,\" Makes-Many-Waves said. \"Your parents paid the Archeins very, very well. Their eyes are everywhere. They'll know you bought me, and they'll come for me.\"\n\"I'll free you,\" Sendrasa replied. \"You'll be safe!\"\n\"It's not like that,\" the Argonian whispered. \"The Archeins don't care whether Argonians they sell are free or not. To live together safely, we must leave &lt;a href=\"Morrowind\"&gt;Morrowind&lt;/a&gt;. \"\n\"I see. Now kiss me.\"\nAs darkness approached, Sendrasa and Makes-Many-Waves began their journey, heading northwest toward the border with &lt;a href=\"Skyrim%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Skyrim&lt;/a&gt;.\n\"Is &lt;a href=\"Riften%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Riften&lt;/a&gt; safe?\" Makes-Many-Waves whispered. They'd traveled several days out of their way to shake off any possible followers.\nBefore Sendrasa could speak, an arrow pierced her throat. She clutched at it with one hand, her eyes widened in surprise. More arrows followed swiftly, killing the &lt;a href=\"Dunmer%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Dark Elf&lt;/a&gt; long before she slid to the ground.\n\"You're free now,\" said an Argonian archer, stepping from the shadows.\nMakes-Many-Waves stared at him, unable to speak or move.\n\"Did she hurt you?\" he asked, coming closer. \"You can return to Black Marsh now. You're no longer a slave.\"\nCollapsing across Sendrasa's body, Makes-Many-Waves sobbed."}

His sawmill keeps the town alive in a lot of ways, even during the times when it's bitter cold out. She believes I should learn more about how his operation works. This is all part of her belief that I'll take over her duties when I'm older. Honestly, I don't think she even wants that. Not in her heart. It must be coming from father.\nAnyway, Wilgin's nice enough. Maybe he'll let me use that big saw to cut up some logs.\nWent to see &lt;a href=\"Havil\"&gt;Havil&lt;/a&gt; at his farm. I always try to find some excuse to leave town and explore the woods. Father warns about &lt;a href=\"Wolf%20%28Online%29\"&gt;wolves&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Troll%20%28Online%29\"&gt;trolls&lt;/a&gt; or whatever, but they never bother me. Havil lets me play with the animals. And the other farmhands like to make me laugh by telling bawdy stories. It's nice there. Far enough away from &lt;a href=\"Morthal%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Morthal&lt;/a&gt; that I feel like I'm my own person. It's the same reason I visit &lt;a href=\"Old%20Mjolen\"&gt;Old Mjolen&lt;/a&gt;\u2014she treats me like a friend and not the &lt;a href=\"jarl\"&gt;jarl&lt;/a&gt;'s daughter.\nAn amazing person just rode into town! I watched her from my window as she went into the tavern. She only carried a backpack and strange staff, so I have no idea why she's here. Nobody ever comes to Morthal unless for a job. I guess she got a room because she didn't come out. I absolutely need to know more.\nHer name is &lt;a href=\"Maxten%20Favrete\"&gt;Maxten&lt;/a&gt;. I waited at the tavern all day hoping to see her. Tried to act occupied, like I was writing a poem or something, so Eyga didn't grow suspicious. But I don't think it worked.\nFinally, I saw her come downstairs and immediately invited her to sit with me. Probably I came across as overly eager. I just don't have a lot of experience with this sort of thing. Maxten stared at me for a bit, probably trying to work out why I was acting friendly. Then she sat down and ordered some dinner. Or breakfast I guess\u2014she mentioned sleeping all day.\nShe's fascinating! Traveled all over the world, learning more about her research. She didn't go into detail, so I didn't pry. We got along rather well. And, I have to say, she's rather beautiful.\nMother caught me sneaking out of the house. Or, I suppose, she caught me sneaking back in. I joined Maxten on one of her trips to find the source of energy she's tracking. At first, I worried when she admitted she studies &lt;a href=\"necromancy\"&gt;necromancy&lt;/a&gt;\u2014we all know the stories about the dangers of such &lt;a href=\"magic\"&gt;magic&lt;/a&gt;. But she's so careful and rigorous about it. I see now that it can be a legitimate area of knowledge, like anything else. It's cute how focused she becomes when testing some dirt or whatever.\nAs we walked through the darkness, I held her hand. There was a moment where I felt so overwhelmed by emotion that I stopped and kissed her. It was warm. Comforting. I want to feel that way again and again.\nLike I said, mother caught me when I returned. She acted stern about my keeping secrets, but I could tell she was just worried. We ended up talking about Maxten, though I left out the part about necromancy. She surprised me by offering encouragement. Morthal doesn't offer much in the way of variety of life experience. And mother had a much fuller life before she came here. I think she wants the same for me.\nFinally, after so much time searching, Maxten tracked down what she's been looking for. She wants me to join her at the old ruins tonight. I'll need to sneak out again, despite Mother's direct wishes. But it's worth it to see my Maxten achieve her goal.\nPeople around town have started to be suspicious of her. It's been months and she hardly speaks to anyone but me. She's just private. They're all good people, just unused to outsiders. Especially mages like Maxten.\nHopefully she will stay even once she's done this ritual. I can't imagine my life without her anymore."}

Effectively, it has the opposite effect of &lt;a href=\"Calm%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Calm&lt;/a&gt;. The magnitude is the level affected; this spell only works on characters and creatures up to the level specified, unless it is dual-cast while having attained the &lt;a href=\"Illusion%20Dual%20Casting\"&gt;Illusion Dual Casting&lt;/a&gt; perk, in addition to certain perks in the Illusion skill tree that increase the spell's effectiveness.

The spell may be used to anger a character that cannot die (a character needed to complete a quest), and once the character begins to attack, the Dragonborn may then fight back without being arrested. About 20 seconds later, the character should get back up, and the Dragonborn may resume the fight.\nAlso an effective way of hunting without Archery or a destruction spell, it can cause &lt;a href=\"Deer%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;deer&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Elk%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;elk&lt;/a&gt; to close to hand weapon range. This can level weapon skills, and provide &lt;a href=\"Leather%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;leather&lt;/a&gt; for &lt;a href=\"Smithing%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Smithing&lt;/a&gt;.

Using Courage or Rally can level up Illusion, and, with the Silent Casting perk as well as the perks needed to affect higher level characters with Illusion spells, Frenzy can be cast from the balcony to cause characters to fight amongst each other. This can be repeated after the spell's effect wears off.\nAlchemy.\nThe following ingredients may be used in any combination of two or three to create a &lt;a href=\"Potions%20%28Skyrim%29%23Frenzy\"&gt;Potion of Frenzy&lt;/a&gt;:"}

The &lt;a href=\"Vestige\"&gt;Vestige&lt;/a&gt; offers to help, and Hazazi tells them to talk to Treethane Niriel. As soon as he mentions the Treethane, a Bosmer walks up and starts dancing behind him. The Vestige can hear Hazazi say \"If only Hazazi was allowed to eat you,\"\"Enjoying the Dominion or not?\" and \"Why do you dance?\"\nGo up the root path to the Treethane's Chambers on the left. The Treethane is sitting in a wooden chair in the back center of the room. She thinks the Vestige is a tourist and mentions that they don't get many visitors, which most choosing to stay behind the shiny, new walls of Marbruk including King Camoran. Their problem with the Dominion is that the Wilderking, who they obey, doesn't seem to like Queen Ayrenn. In order to talk with the Wilderking, they need to gain the Treethane's trust by driving away the Wood Orcs, then they need to plant &lt;a href=\"Lurcher%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Lurchers&lt;/a&gt; in the camp, then kill the Wood Orc Chieftain.\nThe Shimmering Tree has the lurcher seeds. Go down the path and head east. On the ground level, the Vestige may see drummers and dancers. \u00a0This path takes them past some more treehouses, those these ones are closer to the ground. The Shimmering Tree is behind two houses. It looks like a small palm tree surrounded by red flowers. Approaching the tree will cause the quest objective to change from 'Find the Shimmering Tree' to 'Talk to &lt;a href=\"Aranias\"&gt;Aranias&lt;/a&gt;' who is kneeling to the left of the tree. Aranias also asked to see the Wilderking. She and a colleague offered to drive out the Wood Orcs, but the Treethane turned them down. She suggests they use essence from the Kollopi tree to hide themself in a cloud of forest moths, so the Wood Orcs won't see them. The Vestige can ask her about her background, the Wilderking and &lt;a href=\"Andurs\"&gt;Andurs&lt;/a&gt;.\nAndurs is standing behind her. He has been watching the Wood Orc camp. He says not to attack the entire camp and to be careful when fighting the Chieftain. He suggests attacking the shaman who is always near his side first.\u00a0\nThe &lt;a href=\"Kollopi\"&gt;Kollopi&lt;/a&gt; essence and seeds are collected from the tree, and the Vestige heads off to plant them. The planting sites are inside Camp Gushnukbur, which is surrounded by a tall wooden wall. There are Senche Tigers and Orcs to fight, but once the Lurchers are planted they will help, too.\nA Wood Orc shaman and lookout will be waiting near the east side of the camp. The shaman can teleport. Defeat them and enter the cave.\u00a0\nInside, there are more enemies, including Ravagers, Rangers and Sentries.

She says all the townspeople are acting strange as well, but no one's talking. She wants me to help find out what's going on.\"\nWalkthrough.\nWhen approaching &lt;a href=\"Fell%27s%20Run\"&gt;Fell's Run&lt;/a&gt;, you may run into an &lt;a href=\"Orsimer%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Orsimer&lt;/a&gt; named Constable Agazu. Agazu is quite drunk, and will rant about how someone new to town with no experience has replaced her as the town's constable. She will also mention that several of the other townsfolk have started acting strange ever since, and will ask you to investigate. \nAs you approach the town square, you will find the new constable's &lt;a href=\"Bailiff%20Sagabar\"&gt;bailiff&lt;/a&gt; intimidating &lt;a href=\"Ghak%20gro-Urish\"&gt;a man&lt;/a&gt; into giving up the cart he uses to make a living. After the bailiff leaves, talk to the man, and he will tell you to not get involved; he clearly fears the new constable. You can talk to the mayor too, but he will yield little useful information; you will only learn that his wife is sick. When you approach &lt;a href=\"Lauravieve%20Mondorie\"&gt;the jeweler&lt;/a&gt;, you will see a similar interaction as you saw with Ghak gro-Urish, with &lt;a href=\"Leonce%20Gavendien\"&gt;Constable Gavendien&lt;/a&gt; telling her to close up shop early today, and her listening to him. When talked to, she will claim that there is nothing going on here, in a scared tone of voice that suggests something is wrong. She will tell you that the last person Agazu told you to talk to, &lt;a href=\"Gaspard%20Spletis\"&gt;Gaspard Spletis&lt;/a&gt;, has ran out of town. You will find this person just to the north, east of the road. \nGaspard will tell you useful information for your investigation. His friend &lt;a href=\"Gaillard%20Laussac\"&gt;Gaillard Laussac&lt;/a&gt; apparently recognised the new constable from &lt;a href=\"Daggerfall%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Daggerfall&lt;/a&gt; and said that he was a bad man. Gaillard went to meet with the man, but has not returned. Gaspard will then direct you to the constable's residence, the house just east up the hill from your current location. Head inside and you will find Gaillard's dead body, as well as &lt;a href=\"Note%20from%20Sagabar\"&gt;a letter&lt;/a&gt; on the table. It is a letter from Sagabar to the constable, remarking that it was a brilliant idea to get them appointed these positions. The letter also mentions something about hostages.\nWith this evidence in hand, head for the inn and speak with Constable Agazu there. She will note that Constable Gavendien has just left but that Sagabar is still here, so it might be possible to get information out of him. Agazu's plan is to distract Sagabar and then pour a sleeping potion in his drink, after which you can follow him to his room before he passes out. That way you can search his room for clues. There are two people you can talk to about causing a distraction, &lt;a href=\"Georgia%20Matine\"&gt;Georgia Matine&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Dran%20the%20Trickster\"&gt;Dran the Trickster&lt;/a&gt;. Georgia will remark that the bailiff is often distracted by her physique, and Dran will offer you a trinket with which you can summon a banekin and spook the bailiff. \nYou have two options from here: convince the bailiff to go talk to Georgia or use the trinket Dran gave you. If you choose to have him talk to Georgia, . If you choose to use the trinket, Sagabar will run in fear from the banekin, leaving the drink unattended. either way, spike the drink and wait for Sagabar to return and drink it. He will then stumble toward his room; follow him inside and search the place for clues. On the nightstand, you will find &lt;a href=\"Sagabar%27s%20Orders\"&gt;a note&lt;/a&gt; that mentions the relatives of many of the people you spoke to being held hostage at the old mill south of town. \nBefore you head down to present this information to Agazu, be sure to head further upstairs and pick up the lorebook \"&lt;a href=\"The%20Story%20of%20Princess%20Eselde\"&gt;The Story of Princess Eselde&lt;/a&gt;\". Once you have it, head down and talk to Agazu. She'll tell you to head to the mill and free the hostages while she stays and tries to get Sagabar to spill the beans on what exactly they are planning. The mill is southeast of town, just southwest of &lt;a href=\"Shipwright%27s%20Regret\"&gt;Shipwright's Regret&lt;/a&gt;. It will be guarded by &lt;a href=\"Bulzog\"&gt;Bulzog&lt;/a&gt;, an associate of Sagabar and Gavendien, so you will have to kill him. After dealing with him, head inside and speak to &lt;a href=\"Falette%20Normar\"&gt;Falette Normar&lt;/a&gt;. She will tell you that all of this was an elaborate plan by Gavendien to steal an amethyst parcel that was meant to be delivered to the jeweler. \nHead back to town and you will find Agazu in a crowd, standing by the body of the jeweler. Speak with Agazu to finish the quest and start the next one, \"&lt;a href=\"Fell%27s%20Justice\"&gt;Fell's Justice&lt;/a&gt;.\""}

My egg-siblings have endured subjugation by the Empire and slavery at the hands of the &lt;a href=\"Dunmer%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Dunmer&lt;/a&gt;. Armored boots tread on our traditions and culture. We are fortunate to have the Marsh. Without its perils to deter hapless dryskins, our ways might have already crumbled to dust. Despite our troubles, the &lt;a href=\"Hist\"&gt;Hist&lt;/a&gt; guides us still. And for the first time in memory, we have the chance to break the cycle.\nI spent my young life as a slave. An angry one. It cannot have been easy to become recognized for cruelty among the tyrants of &lt;a href=\"House%20Dres%20%28Online%29\"&gt;House Dres&lt;/a&gt;, but Councilman &lt;a href=\"Glathis%20Dres\"&gt;Glathis Dres&lt;/a&gt; managed it. After I was beaten to unconsciousness for seating the guests at a banquet out of order, I could take no more. When I was able to work the &lt;a href=\"Saltrice%20%28Online%29\"&gt;saltrice&lt;/a&gt; fields again, I waited for an opening, overwhelmed the drunken guards, and escaped with my fellow slaves.\nWe fled into the &lt;a href=\"Thornmarsh\"&gt;Thornmarsh&lt;/a&gt;. When we crossed paths with a troop of &lt;a href=\"Argonians%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Argonians&lt;/a&gt;, we realized too late they were traitors, &lt;a href=\"Archon\"&gt;Archein&lt;/a&gt; tribe scum in the employ of House Dres. Hungry and exhausted, we were easy to capture. The sun abandoned my sky. Looking back, though, I see the subtle work of the Hist's will. In the Archein village, a vision came to me. Their Hist tree spoke, showing me blood and horror\u2014the &lt;a href=\"Akaviri%20Invasion\"&gt;Akaviri invasion&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Nords%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Nords&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Dunmer%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Dunmer&lt;/a&gt; falling like dead leaves.\nThis was an opportunity. A turning point. But how could I take advantage? We were taken back to &lt;a href=\"Thorn\"&gt;Thorn&lt;/a&gt;, now nearly empty as the Dunmer answered &lt;a href=\"Almalexia%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Almalexia&lt;/a&gt;'s call to battle. For my transgression, I was to be whipped by Glathis himself. In the courtyard, Glathis struck his first lash. I grabbed his whip and strangled him with it. I'll never forget the look he gave me as the light drained from his eyes.\nWasting no time, I challenged the centurion of the Archein guards for her position by right-of-combat. She could not refuse and maintain any respect from her cohort. The duel was brief. I assumed command and advanced on &lt;a href=\"Stormhold%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Stormhold&lt;/a&gt; to do the same there. I am thankful that I did not need to shed any further Saxhleel blood. &lt;a href=\"Walks-in-Ash\"&gt;Walks-in-Ash&lt;/a&gt;, who met us as we approached, was able to convince Stormhold's &lt;a href=\"Shellbacks\"&gt;Shellbacks&lt;/a&gt; to join our command.\nI revealed my plan. We would march to &lt;a href=\"Morrowind%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Morrowind&lt;/a&gt;, into &lt;a href=\"Stonefalls%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Stonefalls&lt;/a&gt;, and engage in battle\u2014with the &lt;a href=\"Akaviri\"&gt;Akaviri&lt;/a&gt;. We would defend the Dunmer and turn the tide. To say some disagreed with my strategy would be quite an understatement. I told of my vision from the Hist, and let any who wished to return to the Marsh do so. Still strong in numbers, we marched.\nWhen we arrived in the chaos of battle, there was fear on the faces of the Dunmer, who saw armed slaves charging towards them. The fear turned to shock as we joined their ranks, our Shellbacks providing enough muscle to overpower the invaders and force them to flee.\nAnd now, we are recognized. We have allies, not overlords, for the first time in memory. We are free under the law, and we are taking back our villages and strengthening our traditions. There is still bitter blood flowing between many &lt;a href=\"Saxhleel\"&gt;Saxhleel&lt;/a&gt; and our new allies, and not every tribe has joined us\u2014only those of &lt;a href=\"Thornmarsh\"&gt;Thornmarsh&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Shadowfen\"&gt;Shadowfen&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Murkmire\"&gt;Murkmire&lt;/a&gt;. This is not a surprise. I hope that they will, in time, and realize that this opportunity we have been given to cultivate the understanding will allow us to preserve our way of life."}

They appear to be a deviant version of frogs and may even be distantly related to &lt;a href=\"Argonians%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;Argonians&lt;/a&gt;, although I have no direct evidence of that. Like the humble frog, the Grummite is born from eggs found in or near water. The eggs hatch into tiny pollywogs, no bigger than my hand.\nThe pollywog grows quickly, and inside of a few weeks grows limbs and changes into an amphibious &lt;a href=\"Baliwog%20%28Shivering%20Isles%29\"&gt;Baliwog&lt;/a&gt;. The Baliwog will live for up to two years, growing to be larger than a man in both length and weight.\nEventually, the adult Baliwog will feel the urge to seek out deep water and bury itself in the mud. It hibernates there for many months, gestating into a Grummite. I have been unable to determine the exact time of gestation. The Grummite emerges from the mud fully grown.\nNew Grummites never leave the water and are consumed with the urge to mate. Females leave the water to hang their eggs. They are hung over the water to keep them out of reach of aquatic predators, while still allowing the pollywogs to fall into the water when they hatch.\nOnce a female has laid her eggs, she turns her back on them. She will live her life more on land than in the water, although never far from it. The male's mating urges subside after six months to a year. He too takes to the land and like the female does nothing to protect his eggs.\nAdult Grummites have a sort of primitive culture. &lt;a href=\"Kraften%20Highbrow\"&gt;Kraften Highbrow&lt;/a&gt; maintains that they are cunning craftsman that make jewelry and weapons, even mining ore. This is plainly ridiculous. Although I have not determined the source of their tools and adornments, I am certain that they trade with other civilized races for such things.\nAs for tales of magic casting Grummites, that is even more ludicrous. While their primitive brains are surprisingly large, they clearly do not have the intelligence to learn the arcane crafts. I do not know how Kraften managed to train his pet Grummite to cast spells, but I assure all my readers that it is a trick of some sort."}

During this time we bring forth dark tales and unsettling songs. The Unknown Passenger tells of a cloaked figure on a ship who none of the other travelers recall boarding.

The Midnight Lodger rents a room in the dead of night, but vanishes before morning\u2014along with the innkeeper's child.\nWe tell these tales as the nights stretch long. Every race has variations, but there are common themes across Tamriel: danger in the darkness, a threat to the innocent or the young, and a malignant creature that slips its way in amongst the relative safety of hearth and home. But the Wolf That Craved &lt;a href=\"Aetherius\"&gt;the Sky&lt;/a&gt; is the one that still makes me shiver, no matter how high the fire burns.\nAs my Nan told it to all the village's children one long night ago, a great wolf with burning eyes once stalked the land at night. Its endless hunger drove it across the land, where it feasted on the &lt;a href=\"volcanoes\"&gt;volcanoes&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"Morrowind%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Morrowind&lt;/a&gt;, drank the &lt;a href=\"Iliac%20Bay\"&gt;Iliac Bay&lt;/a&gt; dry enough to form the &lt;a href=\"Alik%27r%20Desert%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Alik'r Desert&lt;/a&gt;, and used the &lt;a href=\"Graht-oak\"&gt;great trees&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"Valenwood%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Valenwood&lt;/a&gt; to pick its teeth. But the wolf could not be sated, no matter how much it ate or drank. It wanted more, and more, and more.\nOne night the wolf saw the two moons dancing through the sky. &lt;a href=\"Masser\"&gt;Masser&lt;/a&gt;, the bigger one, laughed and carried on. &lt;a href=\"Secunda\"&gt;Secunda&lt;/a&gt;, the smaller one, followed Masser's lead.\n\"Be quiet!\" snarled the wolf. \"Or I'll pull you from the sky. Then I'll crack you open and devour everything inside, like &lt;a href=\"Ayleid\"&gt;Ayleid&lt;/a&gt; cities.\"\n\"You'll never be able to reach us!\" taunted Masser. \"Reach us,\" echoed Secunda.\n\"Oh?\" snarled the wolf. \"I will leap from the &lt;a href=\"Throat%20of%20the%20World%20%28Online%29\"&gt;highest mountain&lt;/a&gt; until I reach the sky. Then I will stand astride two little moons, gnashing and tearing, until there are moons no more.\"\n\"But everyone will notice if one of us is missing!\" cried Masser. \"&lt;a href=\"Lorkhaj\"&gt;One of us&lt;/a&gt; is missing,\" echoed Secunda.\n\"I will change my skin to match your own,\" snarled the wolf. \"My burning eyes will shine in your place. None will know the difference.\"\n\"The &lt;a href=\"Magnus\"&gt;sun&lt;/a&gt; will know we aren't what we seem!\" cried Masser. \"We aren't what we seem,\" echoed Secunda.\n\"Then I shall make a meal of the sun,\" snarled the wolf. \"And after, I'll consume all the &lt;a href=\"Magna%20Ge\"&gt;stars&lt;/a&gt;.\"\n\"You can't do this to us!\" cried Masser. \"Do this to us,\" echoed Secunda.\n\"But I can,\" snarled the wolf. \"And when I have gorged myself on the sky, when there is nothing left but &lt;a href=\"Void\"&gt;darkness&lt;/a&gt;, I will stand astride the &lt;a href=\"Nirn\"&gt;world&lt;/a&gt; and howl!\"\nAs my Nan leaned forward, fingers extended like claws, a figure with a wolf's head burst into the room and howled. All the children shrieked. Then the candles blew out.\nI remember shivering in the darkness, trying not to make a sound. It seemed like forever, but it was likely a dozen heartbeats.\nA soft light emerged from a lantern held aloft by my Nan. She faced the figure with the wolf's head and said, \"Not yet, wolf. The sun's light is too rich a meal. It will consume you instead.\"\n\"Then I shall wait til the sun is weakest,\" snarled the Skinchanger. \"On that day, I shall swallow it whole.\"\n\"You can try,\" said my Nan, her voice firm. \"But the sun may have other ideas.\"\nWith that, the lantern flared. The Skinchanger howled in pain and fled from the room. For a few moments there was silence. Then my Nan spoke.\n\"Never forget the danger in the darkness. It can slip into your midst and drag you into the night. But light at its dimmest is the old life passing behind us. Soon there will be new life, and the sun shall herald its arrival.\"\nA good number of weeks passed. The New Life Festival began. I remember assembling in the square, just before noon. And I remember children screaming as the wolf-man walked boldly toward us. But we stopped when he pulled the wolf's head from his shoulders, revealing a person beneath.\nIt was my own Da!\nHe wasn't a wolf-man at all. In the light of the noonday sun, he was just a person in a costume. The bear claws and snarling, stylized faces worked into his garb seemed almost ridiculous by light of day. He smiled and told us the light of the Sun had filled him with hope, and that he would be our New Life herald for the festival.\nSo years later, when my littlest asked me why the New Life herald was so scary, I laughed.\n\"Come the fall, you should ask your Nan.\""}

Nonetheless, her heroism and heroic deeds live on, her memories fresh in the stone for all to feel and hear.\n\" .. . muuu uhh, I wonder if this will really work?\"\n\"The &lt;a href=\"Mages%20Guild\"&gt;Mages guild&lt;/a&gt; took me for 25,000 gold crowns if it doesn't. Imagine? This stone will record my thoughts? What did they say? Just unwrap it from the silver foil and leather bag and as soon as it touches my flesh it will begin to record.\n\"Ahhhh, the pain, I must block it out, no one would want to hold my stone and hear my thoughts if I let it record my pain. Thank the &lt;a href=\"Reymon%20Ebonarm\"&gt;Ebonarm&lt;/a&gt; and the training I received in The &lt;a href=\"Hall%20of%20the%20Virtues%20of%20War\"&gt;Hall of the Virtues of War&lt;/a&gt;. I CAN block out this pain. Ummm just, ah, there, it's walled off.\n\"Yes I can still see it there just beyond my consciousness lurking like a hungry wolf - a wolf that will soon consume me. I see also my inevitable death from these damned wounds. No potions left, the healing crystal and ring are used up, and me, with not even magic enough to light a candle. Oh but the gods did give me other gifts, the gift of sword singing, the thrill of battle, &lt;a href=\"Frandar%20Hunding\"&gt;Frandar Hunding&lt;/a&gt;'s &lt;a href=\"Book%20of%20Circles\"&gt;Book of Circles&lt;/a&gt;, THE WAY OF THE SWORD. Ah but then that is my story, I get ahead of myself.\nI am Makela Leki a warrior, a &lt;a href=\"sword-singer\"&gt;sword-singer&lt;/a&gt;, a second level &lt;a href=\"Ansei\"&gt;Ansei&lt;/a&gt;. In my cradle I could form the &lt;a href=\"Shehai\"&gt;Shehai&lt;/a&gt;, the spirit sword - The mystical blade, mine formed of pure thought serpents intertwined with vines of roses to form the blade, as beautiful as ...\nAh, but I'm about to tell you all about that, to tell you my story, a story of valiant battle, of my loves, of my wars, of betrayal and of this last glorious victory. To tell you of how I came to this distant lonely pass me and five companions, to fight these men and monsters to defeat the army that would fall on my people like cowards in the night, but again I get ahead of myself.\nI am a simple warrior. I grew up as a Maiden of the Spirit Blade. As early as I can remember I wanted to be a Singer, to feel the hunger of the blade in my hands, to feel it come alive and take my enemies. I am told our people were artisans and poets long ago in our desert homes. Here in new home now known as &lt;a href=\"Hammerfell\"&gt;Hammerfell&lt;/a&gt;, many of us have returned to those ancient ways, but to me there is but ONE WAY. THE WAY of the SWORD.\nAh this is hard to tell. I grew up in my noble family, the only one of three brothers and two sisters that felt the calling, the &lt;a href=\"Sword-Singers\"&gt;Song of the Sword&lt;/a&gt;. Father understood, for he too had felt the call. He had become a master, and Ansei long before settling down with in our estate to raise a family. At eleven, I entered the Hall of the Virtues of War and joined the Maidens of the Spirit Sword. In my band there were six of us. Daring Julia, solid Patia, big Kati, svelte Cegila, wise Zell, and me - all are gone now, save me, and soon I will join them. ... Join them in the halls of the unknown gods of war.\nWe drank together, we fought, we wept, we grew in the way of the sword. We joined in our learnings in the Hall with our Brothers of the Blade. Learning from each other, we all sat at the feet of the Hall Master striving to learn the depths of the Shehai - making the spirit blade into a real weapon as Frandar Hunding had. Only a few have the purity of heart and virtue to be able to take the step and learn the mysteries of Ansei. Sword Sainthood.\nSomehow, of all the Brothers and the Maidens, I only possessed the unique qualities, the faint but strong enough flicker of magicka to call forth the Shehai. Many times I called it, seldom would it become substantial enough to be a weapon. To be an Ansei of the first level you just need to be able to call it, and that I could, so I became the first Ansei from our local hall in two generations.\nOh I have so much to tell, so many memories, so many treasures to share with you, my unknown companion. How do I start?\nUmhhh, the pain is still out there lurking hungry, slowly consuming what's left of me. I guess I had better tell of the final battle, the one that has left me here, and then if I have the will left tell you of my life, of my love Raliph. Oh what a lad he was. What times we shared ... Ebonarm ... Forgive me, my mind wanders ... Let me go to the Final Battle.\nUmm to start, in the middle humm. Yes. We Maidens grew, learned, mastered the Way, and upon completing the Walk-About. To you who are not Singers, this is a wilderness trek emulating the times of Frandar Hunding - where we each wander the country side righting wrongs, defeating monsters, performing quests in the name of virtue. Some of us in our Hall took years to finish. Always there is danger, we six Maidens each returned in our own good time, but many are they who do not live to return from the Walk About.\nWe returned, each to our own lives, to meet in the hall once a week to tell our stories to the new Maidens and Brothers, and to perform as instructors in the Way of the sword. All was well till the night of the &lt;a href=\"Mid%20Year%20Celebration\"&gt;Mid Year Festival&lt;/a&gt;.\nAll our people were reveling and ... excuse ... enjoying the repast, but for we six Maidens. It happened that the festival day fell on our day of meeting in the hall, our day of prayer and fasting and honor to the Way of the Sword.\nAs we met, late into the night, a knocking rang on our door. When I opened, it there was a guardian the Bankorai Pass in the &lt;a href=\"Wrothgarian%20Mountains%20%28Daggerfall%29\"&gt;Wrothgarian Mountains&lt;/a&gt;, wounded and near death ... He told us of betrayal from the north, an invasion sponsored by the &lt;a href=\"Crystal%20Tower\"&gt;Crystal Tower&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"High%20Rock\"&gt;High Rock&lt;/a&gt;, led by King &lt;a href=\"Joile\"&gt;Joile&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"Daggerfall\"&gt;Daggerfall&lt;/a&gt;-- our ally in the war with &lt;a href=\"Orsinium\"&gt;Orsinium&lt;/a&gt;!\nQuickly we used up a crystal of healing in restoring him to vitality. We sent him on to the king, while we six grabbed our weapons and armor of power, and as many potions, marks, and crystals and rings as we could carry.\nWe flew to the pass hoping upon hope that we would not be too late. Our journey was not in vain, for we arrived just at the very point where the last three guardians were overwhelmed by the horde. Into the pass we ran forming the old battle line, six abreast.\nOh did we FIGHT.\nThe Song of the Sword was a joyous noise slicing through the ranks of evil. We fought for hours. Julia was the first to fall, a cowardly poisoned dagger finding a rent in her armor. Then one by one all fell, save me.\n... oh cruel Ebonarm ... Then my beloved sword, the sword of my father, the one with the serpent's crest, fashioned by the master sword smith Singer Tansal broke in my hands. All was lost, our six lives spent in vain. Now, many many of them would pour through the pass. I would be easy prey for them, like a newborn child. I wept in frustration.\nThen I remembered the hearth in our home - the book. Frandar Hunding's Book of Circles, the Way of Strategy. I reached for the Shehai the spirit sword, that which I could never reliably form when I needed it, and behold ... it was alive. Alive with fire. It formed in my hand. Ablaze with power ---\nOh I slew mightily, right and left, like a scythe through wheat. All the way to the Lord of the Tower I fought. With one blow I cut his magical armor asunder, one more took his head.\nBut to do that deed cost me dearly, wounds by the dozen, for although I had magical armor, it was not formed of spirit like my blade, it was not as invincible as my blade or my own spirit, and I was sorely wounded.\nWith the felling of King Joile, his army crumbled. They fled before my wrath. All ran back through the pass not even pausing to collect their dead and wounded. All who could stand ran for their lives, and I slew all I could reach, but my breath was coming short, and the pain ...\nFinally I rested, on this rock where you find me now. I don't know why I chanced to bring this stone along. I bought it on a whim really, with the loot from ... ah well I guess I need to really stop and tell my story in order. I feel able to go on to tell you more ... the eternal night is descending more slowly than I thought.\nNot just yet, am I ready to compose my death poem. A little sip of water and ... well I think I will go back and tell you of my life, maybe some details about the battle. And Oh yes. About Raliph and our children, humm where will I start.\n... oh ... rrr ...\nI am ... a simple warrior ... I grew up as a, a Maiden of the Spirit Blade ... As early ... as early as I can ... remember ..."}

In fact, human settlers occupied nearly every corner of Tamriel before Skyrim was even founded. These so-called \"&lt;a href=\"Nede\"&gt;Nedic peoples&lt;/a&gt;\" include the proto-Cyrodilians, the ancestors of the &lt;a href=\"Bretons\"&gt;Bretons&lt;/a&gt;, the aboriginals of &lt;a href=\"Hammerfell\"&gt;Hammerfell&lt;/a&gt;, and perhaps a now-vanished Human population of &lt;a href=\"Morrowind\"&gt;Morrowind&lt;/a&gt;. Strictly speaking, the Nords are simply another of these Nedic peoples, the only one that failed to find a method of peaceful accommodation with the Elves who already occupied Tamriel.\n&lt;a href=\"Ysgramor\"&gt;Ysgramor&lt;/a&gt; was certainly not the first human settler in Tamriel. In fact, in \"fleeing civil war in &lt;a href=\"Atmora\"&gt;Atmora&lt;/a&gt;,\" as the &lt;a href=\"Song%20of%20Return\"&gt;Song of Return&lt;/a&gt; states, Ysgramor was following a long tradition of migration from Atmora; Tamriel had served as a \"safety valve\" for Atmora for centuries before Ysgramor's arrival. Malcontents, dissidents, rebels, landless younger sons, all made the difficult crossing from Atmora to the \"New World\" of Tamriel. New archeological excavations date the earliest human settlements in &lt;a href=\"Hammerfell\"&gt;Hammerfell&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"High%20Rock\"&gt;High Rock&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Cyrodiil\"&gt;Cyrodiil&lt;/a&gt; at &lt;a href=\"Merethic%20Era\"&gt;ME800-1000&lt;/a&gt;, centuries earlier than Ysgramor, even assuming that the twelve Nord \"kings\" prior to &lt;a href=\"Harald\"&gt;Harald&lt;/a&gt; were actual historical figures.\nThe Nedic peoples were a minority in a land of &lt;a href=\"Elves\"&gt;Elves&lt;/a&gt;, and had no choice but to live peacefully with the Elder Race. In High Rock, Hammerfell, Cyrodiil, and possibly Morrowind, they did just that, and the Nedic peoples flourished and expanded over the last centuries of the Merethic Era. Only in Skyrim did this accommodation break down, an event recorded in the Song of Return. Perhaps, being close to reinforcements from Atmora, the proto-Nords did not feel it necessary to submit to the authority of the Skyrim Elves. Indeed, the early Nord chronicles note that under King Harald, the first historical Nord ruler (&lt;a href=\"1E%20113\"&gt;1E113&lt;/a&gt; - &lt;a href=\"1E%20221\"&gt;1E 221&lt;/a&gt;), \"the &lt;a href=\"Atmoran\"&gt;Atmoran&lt;/a&gt; mercenaries returned to their homeland\u201d following the consolidation of Skyrim as a centralized kingdom. Whatever the case, the pattern was set\u2014in Skyrim, expansion would proceed militarily, with human settlement following the frontier of conquest, and the line between Human territory and Elven territory was relatively clear.\nBut beyond this \"zone of conflict,\" the other Nedic peoples continued to merge with their Elven neighbors. When the Nord armies of the &lt;a href=\"Nordic%20Empire\"&gt;First Empire&lt;/a&gt; finally entered High Rock and Cyrodiil, they found Bretons and proto-Cyrodiils already living there among the Elves. Indeed, the Nords found it difficult to distinguish between Elf and Breton, the two races had already intermingled to such a degree. The arrival of the Nord armies upset the balance of power between the Nedic peoples and the Elves. Although the Nords' expansion into High Rock and Cyrodiil was relatively brief (less than two centuries), the result was decisive; from then on, power in those regions shifted from the Elves to the Humans."}

Alternatively, one has the option to kill Louis, granting ownership of Frost automatically.\nFrost seems to be more aggressive in combat than other horses. He has more health and stamina than regular horses, but less than the &lt;a href=\"Dark%20Brotherhood%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Dark Brotherhood's&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Shadowmere%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Shadowmere&lt;/a&gt;.\nEven when not actually riding Frost, he will, like any other horse, appear after &lt;a href=\"Fast%20Travel%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;fast traveling&lt;/a&gt; to any location that is not within a walled city. If that location is populated by bandits or mages or any other enemies, this greatly inhibits the ability to perform sneak attacks since Frost will attack immediately, resulting in his death if there are many enemies. At higher levels, if fast traveling triggers the appearance of an &lt;a href=\"Elder%20Dragon%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Elder Dragon&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"Ancient%20Dragon%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Ancient Dragon&lt;/a&gt;, Frost has little chance of surviving such an attack. If the Dragonborn wishes to keep Frost, care must be taken in choosing fast travel destinations to avoid such encounters.\nIf Frost happens to get lost before speaking with &lt;a href=\"Maven%20Black-Briar\"&gt;Maven Black-Briar&lt;/a&gt;, he might be outside of &lt;a href=\"Merryfair%20Farm\"&gt;Merryfair Farm&lt;/a&gt;.

Additionally, if one dismounts Frost prior to returning to Louis Letrush during \"Promises To Keep,\" he may return to the Black-Briar Lodge."}

They are found as both wild and &lt;a href=\"Conjuration%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;summoned&lt;/a&gt; creatures. They are both companions and enemies, and are the only\u00a0&lt;a href=\"Atronach\"&gt;Atronach&lt;/a&gt;s\u00a0that use melee attacks exclusively. Like all other Atronachs, their bodies are composed of their respective element, and the Frost Atronach is no exception, as its body is made of solid ice.\nCharacteristics.\nFrost Atronachs use their bulky forms to deal out physical damage, and never cast spells. Frost Atronachs are also completely immune to frost damage, but are &lt;a href=\"Weakness%20to%20Fire%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;50% weaker to&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Fire%20Damage%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;fire damage&lt;/a&gt;. Hitting them with a frost spell still counts as an attack though, and this will eventually turn them hostile.\nAttacks.\nThe Frost Atronach has four melee attacks. One consists of a jabbing attack that the atronach does with its right pointy arm and two clubbing attacks that it does with its left club arm, which consists of brutal uppercuts and swipes with the forearm. The stab has longer range but the club deals more damage. The last attack is performed with its club arm, where it brings it up and smashes its \"fist\" into the ground for a damaging, area-of-effect staggering attack.\nIf one is very close to a hostile Frost Atronach, one's health and stamina will rapidly decrease as the icy touch of the atronach's body gives off a permanent &lt;a href=\"Frost%20Cloak%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;frost cloak&lt;/a&gt;. This only applies to people and creatures the atronach (or its summoner, if applicable) is hostile to.\nDue to their hulking mass and the fact that they cannot cast spells, Frost Atronachs are highly vulnerable against long-ranged attacks, including archers, mages and dragons, making them best suited to short distance fights, such as those in dungeons and other confined places.\nLocations.\nThe only three places to find Frost Atronachs are: &lt;a href=\"The%20Chill\"&gt;The Chill&lt;/a&gt; (three), one can be in the summoning chamber of &lt;a href=\"Cragwallow%20Slope\"&gt;Cragwallow Slope&lt;/a&gt; if a high enough level, and three can appear in &lt;a href=\"The%20Caller\"&gt;The Caller&lt;/a&gt;'s chamber in &lt;a href=\"Fellglow%20Keep\"&gt;Fellglow Keep&lt;/a&gt; during the &lt;a href=\"College%20of%20Winterhold%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;College of Winterhold's&lt;/a&gt; questline. Otherwise, Conjurers, &lt;a href=\"Thalmor%20Wizard\"&gt;Thalmor Wizard&lt;/a&gt;s and &lt;a href=\"Draugr%20Scourge%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Draugr Scourge mages&lt;/a&gt; have the ability to summon the atronachs.\nSubtypes.\nFrost Atronachs come in a few types, though visually identical, their stats differ."}

It deals frost damage to &lt;a href=\"Health%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;health&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Stamina%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;stamina&lt;/a&gt; like frost spells, and also slows the target's movements.\nEnchanting.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Last%20Dragonborn\"&gt;Dragonborn&lt;/a&gt; can learn this enchantment by disenchanting any weapon of any sort with the Frost Damage Enchantment already imbued on it. The enchanted weapon will glow bright blue, and deal damage to both health and stamina as well as cause the target that was struck to slow down rather considerably. The higher the Dragonborn's Enchanting skill is (along with any &lt;a href=\"Fortify%20Enchanting\"&gt;Fortify Enchanting&lt;/a&gt; equipment or potions taken/worn), the more damage the enchantment will deal. If is installed, frost enchantments placed on &lt;a href=\"Stalhrim%20Weapons%20%28Dragonborn%29\"&gt;Stalhrim weapons&lt;/a&gt; will be 25% stronger.\nUses.\nWhat makes frost damage unique from the other two elements is that the effect, regardless if it is from an enchantment or a spell, will not only cause a target's stamina to rapidly drain, but will also greatly reduce their natural walking/running speed; leaving them being able to move very little to almost not at all. Due to this, the effects of frost damage can prove to be a very powerful advantage over both strong and fast opponents as they will be left in a completely vulnerable state and the player can quickly take advantage of this and rush in to attack before they have a chance to recover.\nIn addition to its initial qualities, while frost damage is good for keeping the more brutish or more agile opponents at a distance, if timed correctly, summoning an ice storm or blizzard can be used to quickly overpower and even defeat multiple opponents at once with incredible efficiency.\nFrost Damage is most effective when it is used at a long &lt;a href=\"Archery%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;range&lt;/a&gt;, as any enemy that does not die immediately from the initial attack will be slowed and will be more easier to hit.\nThough for its powerful qualities, frost damage has a serious limitation, as many enemies in Skyrim have an innate resistance to it. Those include:\nHowever, it should be noted that most of them resist the damage, but are not immune to it.\u00a0It is also possible to use a powerful enough &lt;a href=\"Alchemy%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;poison&lt;/a&gt; of aversion to frost or magic to negate the enemy's resistance.\nCombined with other effects.\nFor players who have the &lt;a href=\"Extra%20Effect\"&gt;Extra Effect&lt;/a&gt; perk, Frost Damage can be combined very effectively with &lt;a href=\"Shock%20Damage%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Shock damage&lt;/a&gt;, as all three attributes, Health, Stamina, and &lt;a href=\"Magicka%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Magicka&lt;/a&gt; are damaged all at once.\nSpells.\nSpells that deal Frost damage:\nUnique weapons.\nUnique, frost-enchanted weapons:"}

They are larger in appearance than &lt;a href=\"Blood%20Dragon%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;blood&lt;/a&gt; or brown dragons and their powerful frost attacks may kill the Dragonborn before they even see what they are fighting. However, even though they are much stronger than their weaker cousins, they will still fight in the same manner. \nPhysical appearance.\nFrost dragons are predominantly white, with black and purple sections on their head, neck, wings, tail, and legs. Their eyes are icy blue and seem to glow in their sunken-in black sockets. Their heads are covered with jagged black frills, and their backs feature rows of long, sharp black spines. Their wings are tattered, and their tail is tipped with a larger spade shape.\nGameplay.\nAerial.\nFrost dragons begin by remaining airborne, blasting the ground with their frost breath. This frost breath is significantly stronger than that used by other dragons, and can drain one's stamina instantly. Frost dragons can also use the &lt;a href=\"Frost%20Breath\"&gt;Frost Breath&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"shout\"&gt;shout&lt;/a&gt;, which fires a blast of intense cold much further than their standard breath. \nIf the &lt;a href=\"Last%20Dragonborn\"&gt;Dragonborn&lt;/a&gt; is a fighter, invest in cold-resistant potions and armor, stamina potions, and stamina regeneration jewelry/armor. Being a &lt;a href=\"Nords%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Nord&lt;/a&gt; or a &lt;a href=\"Vampirism%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;vampire&lt;/a&gt; provides a 25% resistance to &lt;a href=\"Frost%20Damage%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;frost damage&lt;/a&gt;. When safe, pelt the dragon with arrows from a bow, preferably enchanted with &lt;a href=\"Fire%20Damage%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;fire damage&lt;/a&gt;, and seek cover when it attacks. \nIf the Dragonborn is a mage, invest in cold-resistant armor and cast fire spells. Frost dragons take 50% more damage from fire, so plenty of Magicka and high-level Destruction will make short work of them. A staff of &lt;a href=\"Firebolt\"&gt;Firebolt&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"Fireball%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Fireball&lt;/a&gt; accompanied by a &lt;a href=\"Steadfast%20Ward%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Steadfast Ward&lt;/a&gt; allows one to continually blast the dragon, even when in the direct line of fire. \nGrounded.\nOnce the dragon lands, strafe around it to avoid its breath and bite, and attack it. If ones weapon is enchanted with fire damage, it should quickly bring the dragon down. Power attacks will stagger it and interrupt its attacks, but be mindful not to get caught in its breath, as it will reduce stamina.\nIf the Dragonborn is a mage, they can attack the dragon with Firebolt or Fireball spells. The Impact perk in the school of &lt;a href=\"Destruction%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Destruction&lt;/a&gt; can make the fight easier, as each dual-casted spell can stagger the dragon, in addition to dealing significant damage.

Just like ordinary trolls, they have a &lt;a href=\"Weakness%20to%20Fire%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;weakness&lt;/a&gt; to &lt;a href=\"Fire%20Damage%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;fire&lt;/a&gt;.\nLocations.\nFrost trolls can be found in snowy areas, such as &lt;a href=\"Winterhold%20%28Skyrim%20Hold%29\"&gt;Winterhold&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"The%20Pale\"&gt;The Pale&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"Eastmarch%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Eastmarch&lt;/a&gt;, as well as the northern areas in &lt;a href=\"Solstheim%20%28Dragonborn%29\"&gt;Solstheim&lt;/a&gt;. They are especially fond of caves, but may also be found in abandoned ruins like &lt;a href=\"Labyrinthian%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Labyrinthian&lt;/a&gt;. Early in the game, the &lt;a href=\"Last%20Dragonborn\"&gt;Dragonborn&lt;/a&gt; will encounter at least one frost troll on the way up the &lt;a href=\"Seven%20Thousand%20Steps\"&gt;Seven-Thousand Steps&lt;/a&gt; to &lt;a href=\"High%20Hrothgar%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;High Hrothgar&lt;/a&gt;.\nDescription.\nFrost trolls are ape-like, humanoid creatures with long, muscular arms and claw-tipped fingers. Their large mouths are filled with jagged teeth. Frost troll possess a third eye in the center of the forehead. Their hide is covered in a thick, shaggy white coat.\nBehavior.\nFrost trolls are typically hostile to most creatures and rarely back down or flee when faced with a more powerful opponent.\nThough very strong, they are not very fast. A troll prefers to pummel its prey into submission with powerful arm strikes and claw attacks. Occasionally, they will roar mid-battle or beat their fists on the ground, making it easy to get a few free hits on them.\nCombat.\nLike ordinary Trolls, Frost Trolls have the ability to rapidly regenerate at two heath points per second. As such, a prolonged fight could prove to be very difficult or even fatal at low levels. On further note, a Frost Troll will attack using its powerful, claw-tipped arms to attack the target. Speed and aggression are the key to beating a troll."}
