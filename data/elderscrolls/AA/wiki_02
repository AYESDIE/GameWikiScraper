They reached \"Godhood\" after the &lt;a href=\"Battle%20of%20Red%20Mountain\"&gt;Battle of Red Mountain&lt;/a&gt; circa 1E 700 and continued to be worshiped until the &lt;a href=\"Red%20Year\"&gt;Red Year&lt;/a&gt;. After this the Tribunal were relegated to saints.\nAlmalexia (\"Mother Morrowind\").\n&lt;a href=\"Almalexia\"&gt;Almalexia&lt;/a&gt; is also known as the \"Lady of Mercy\"; her anticipation was &lt;a href=\"Boethiah\"&gt;Boethiah&lt;/a&gt;. Her acts of amazing power and kindness are countless and her blessing was said to do extraordinary things, like protect a person infected with &lt;a href=\"Corprus\"&gt;Corprus&lt;/a&gt; from suffering the disease's effects.\nMost traces of &lt;a href=\"Akatosh\"&gt;Akatosh&lt;/a&gt; disappeared from ancient &lt;a href=\"Chimer\"&gt;Chimer&lt;/a&gt; legends during their so-called \"exodus,\" primarily due to that god's association and esteem with the &lt;a href=\"Altmer\"&gt;Altmer&lt;/a&gt;i. However, most aspects of Akatosh which seem so important to the mortal races, namely immortality, historicity, and genealogy, have conveniently resurfaced in Almalexia, the most popular of the &lt;a href=\"Tribunal\"&gt;Tribunal&lt;/a&gt;.\nVivec (\"Master of Morrowind\").\n&lt;a href=\"Vivec\"&gt;Vivec&lt;/a&gt; is the warrior-poet god of the &lt;a href=\"Dunmer\"&gt;Dunmer&lt;/a&gt;; his anticipation was &lt;a href=\"Mephala\"&gt;Mephala&lt;/a&gt;. Vivec has always represented the spirit and duality of the Dunmer people, which is reflected in his half-Dunmer, half-Chimer appearance. For hundreds if not thousands of years, he mostly resided at the pinnacle of his Palace in Vivec, his capital, which was visited by hundreds of pilgrims and tourists daily.\nVivec is the invisible keeper of the holy land, ever vigilant against the &lt;a href=\"Dagoth%20Ur%20%28Character%29\"&gt;dark gods&lt;/a&gt; of the &lt;a href=\"Red%20Mountain\"&gt;Volcano&lt;/a&gt;. He has saved the Dunmeri people from certain death on numerous occasions, most notably when he taught them how to breathe water for a day so that he could flood Morrowind and kill the &lt;a href=\"Akaviri\"&gt;Akaviri&lt;/a&gt; invaders, ca. &lt;a href=\"2E%20572\"&gt;2E 572&lt;/a&gt;.\nSotha Sil (\"Mystery of Morrowind\").\n&lt;a href=\"Sotha%20Sil\"&gt;Sotha Sil&lt;/a&gt; is another god of the &lt;a href=\"Dunmer\"&gt;Dunmer&lt;/a&gt;; he was the anticipation of &lt;a href=\"Azura\"&gt;Azura&lt;/a&gt; and the least known of the divine &lt;a href=\"Tribunal\"&gt;Tribunal&lt;/a&gt;. It was Sotha Sil who discovered how to use &lt;a href=\"Kagrenac%27s%20Tools\"&gt;Kagrenac's Tools&lt;/a&gt; to achieve divinity. He is said to be reshaping the world from his hidden, &lt;a href=\"clockwork%20city\"&gt;clockwork city&lt;/a&gt;.\n&lt;a href=\"The%20Reclamations\"&gt;The Reclamations&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe destruction of &lt;a href=\"Vivec%20City\"&gt;Vivec City&lt;/a&gt; and the subsequent eruption of &lt;a href=\"Red%20Mountain\"&gt;Red Mountain&lt;/a&gt; in 4E 5 cut deeply into the ancient religious beliefs of the Dunmer. The fall of the &lt;a href=\"Ministry%20of%20Truth\"&gt;Ministry of Truth&lt;/a&gt; was the last straw in the tottering support for the &lt;a href=\"Tribunal\"&gt;Tribunal&lt;/a&gt;s worship.\nThe Daedra venerated by the Ashlander tribes (&lt;a href=\"Azura\"&gt;Azura&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Mephala\"&gt;Mephala&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Boethiah\"&gt;Boethiah&lt;/a&gt;) were named the \"true way\" and should be revered by the Dunmer people. The Daedra\u2014originally known as the \"Anticipations\"\u2014were named the \"Reclamations,\" having culturally \"reclaimed\" their status from the Tribunal.\n&lt;a href=\"Azura\"&gt;Azura&lt;/a&gt; (\"Goddess of Dusk and Dawn\").\nAzura was the god-ancestor that taught the &lt;a href=\"Chimer\"&gt;Chimer&lt;/a&gt; the mysteries needed to be different than the &lt;a href=\"Altmer\"&gt;Altmer&lt;/a&gt;. Some of her more conventional teachings are sometimes attributed to Boethiah. In the stories, Azura is often more a communal cosmic force for the race as a whole than an ancestor or a god.\n&lt;a href=\"Boethiah\"&gt;Boethiah&lt;/a&gt; (\"Prince of Plots\").\nBoethiah is the original god-ancestor of the Dark Elves. Through his illuminations, the eventual \"&lt;a href=\"Chimer\"&gt;Chimer&lt;/a&gt;,\" or Changed Folk, renounced all ties to the Aldmer and founded a new nation based on Daedric principles. All manner of Dark Elven cultural \"advances\" are attributed to Boethiah, from philosophy to magic to \"responsible\" architecture. Ancient Velothi allegories are uniformly heroic successes of Boethiah over enemies of every type, foundation stories of Chimeri struggle.\n&lt;a href=\"Mephala\"&gt;Mephala&lt;/a&gt; (\"Androgyne\").\nMephala is the \"Webspinner\", or the \"Spider God\". In &lt;a href=\"Morrowind\"&gt;Morrowind&lt;/a&gt;, she was the ancestor that taught the &lt;a href=\"Chimer\"&gt;Chimer&lt;/a&gt; the skills they would need to evade their enemies or to kill them with secret murder. Enemies were numerous in those days since the Chimer were a small faction. She, along with Boethiah, organized the clan systems that eventually became the basis for the Great Houses. She founded the &lt;a href=\"Morag%20Tong%20%28Morrowind%29\"&gt;Morag Tong&lt;/a&gt;.\n&lt;a href=\"The%20House%20of%20Troubles\"&gt;The House of Troubles&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe four &lt;a href=\"Daedra\"&gt;Daedra&lt;/a&gt; Lords, &lt;a href=\"Malacath\"&gt;Malacath&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Mehrunes%20Dagon\"&gt;Mehrunes Dagon&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Molag%20Bal\"&gt;Molag Bal&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Sheogorath\"&gt;Sheogorath&lt;/a&gt;, are known as the Four Corners of the House of Troubles. These Daedra Lords rebelled against the counsel and admonition of the &lt;a href=\"Tribunal\"&gt;Tribunal&lt;/a&gt;, causing great kinstrife and confusion among the clans and Great Houses. They are considered holy in that they serve the role of obstacles during the Testing.\n&lt;a href=\"Malacath\"&gt;Malacath&lt;/a&gt; (\"God-King of the &lt;a href=\"Orcs\"&gt;Orcs&lt;/a&gt;\").\nMalacath, called Malak by the &lt;a href=\"Dunmer\"&gt;Dunmer&lt;/a&gt;, is the god-king of the orcs. He is the reanimated dung that was &lt;a href=\"Trinimac\"&gt;Trinimac&lt;/a&gt;, Malacath is considered a weak but vengeful god by the &lt;a href=\"Dunmer\"&gt;Dunmer&lt;/a&gt;. He tests the Dunmer for physical weakness.\n&lt;a href=\"Molag%20Bal\"&gt;Molag Bal&lt;/a&gt; (\"King of Rape\").\nIn Morrowind, Molag Bal is the King of Rape. He tries to upset the bloodlines of Houses and otherwise ruin the Dunmer gene pool. A race of monsters, said to live in &lt;a href=\"Molag%20Amur\"&gt;Molag Amur&lt;/a&gt;, are the result of his seduction of &lt;a href=\"Vivec\"&gt;Vivec&lt;/a&gt; during the a previous era.\n&lt;a href=\"Sheogorath\"&gt;Sheogorath&lt;/a&gt; (\"King of Madness\").\nSheogorath is the King of Madness. He always tests the Dunmer for mental weakness. In many legends he is called upon by one Dunmer faction against another; in half of these stories he does not betray those who called him, further confusing the issue of his place in the scheme of things.\n&lt;a href=\"Mehrunes%20Dagon\"&gt;Mehrunes Dagon&lt;/a&gt; (\"God of Destruction\").\n&lt;a href=\"Mehrunes%20Dagon\"&gt;Mehrunes Dagon&lt;/a&gt; is the god of destruction. He is associated with natural dangers like fire, earthquakes, and floods. To some he represents the inhospitable land of Morrowind. He tests the Dunmer will to survive and persevere.\nOther revered divine spirits.\n&lt;a href=\"Lorkhan\"&gt;Lorkhan&lt;/a&gt; (\"The Missing God\").\nThis Creator-Trickster-Tester deity is in every Tamrielic mythic tradition. His most popular name is the Aldmeri \"Lorkhan,\" or Doom Drum. In &lt;a href=\"Morrowind\"&gt;Morrowind&lt;/a&gt;, for example, he is a being related to the &lt;a href=\"Psijic%20Endeavor\"&gt;Psijic Endeavor&lt;/a&gt;, a process by which mortals are charged with transcending the gods that created them.\nSaints.\n&lt;a href=\"Nerevar\"&gt;Nerevar&lt;/a&gt; (\"Godkiller\").\nThe Chimeri king of &lt;a href=\"Resdayn\"&gt;Resdayn&lt;/a&gt;, the Golden Age of old &lt;a href=\"Veloth\"&gt;Veloth&lt;/a&gt;. Slain during the &lt;a href=\"Battle%20of%20Red%20Mountain\"&gt;Battle of Red Mountain&lt;/a&gt;, Nerevar was the Herald of the Triune Way, and is the foremost of the saints of Dunmeri faith. He is said to have killed &lt;a href=\"Dumac\"&gt;Dumac&lt;/a&gt;, the Last Dwarven King, and feasted on his heart."}

The area is heavily forested and houses a variety of ruins ranging from the Ancient Nords to the Dwemer. Dunstad itself serves as a resting station between Dawnstar and Central Skyrim; it is sought out by the Bandits of Skyrim as well as rival nations of Dawnstar. The nearest settlement to Dunstad are the townships of &lt;a href=\"Stonehills\"&gt;Stonehills&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Lainalten\"&gt;Lainalten&lt;/a&gt;, and the city of &lt;a href=\"Snowhawk\"&gt;Snowhawk&lt;/a&gt;.\nHistory.\n&lt;a href=\"Third%20Era\"&gt;Third Era&lt;/a&gt;.\nDuring the &lt;a href=\"Imperial%20Simulacrum\"&gt;Imperial Simulacrum&lt;/a&gt; from &lt;a href=\"3E%20389\"&gt;3E 389&lt;/a&gt; to &lt;a href=\"3E%20399\"&gt;3E 399&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Emperor\"&gt;Emperor&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Uriel%20Septim%20VII\"&gt;Uriel Septim VII&lt;/a&gt; was imprisoned along with &lt;a href=\"Talin%20Warhaft\"&gt;Talin Warhaft&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;a href=\"Deadlands\"&gt;Deadlands&lt;/a&gt; by &lt;a href=\"Jagar%20Tharn\"&gt;Jagar Tharn&lt;/a&gt;. Tharn planned for months to capture the throne, and he was able to achieve so in the span of ten years. Tharn had a powerful weapon called the &lt;a href=\"Staff%20of%20Chaos\"&gt;Staff of Chaos&lt;/a&gt;, and he split it into nine pieces and scattered them across Tamriel, the staff was the only thing keeping Uriel Septim and Warhaft in &lt;a href=\"Oblivion\"&gt;Oblivion&lt;/a&gt;.

During the time of &lt;a href=\"Haymon%20Camoran\"&gt;Haymon Camoran&lt;/a&gt; Battle for the throne, it was controlled by the &lt;a href=\"Red%20Sabre\"&gt;Red Sabre&lt;/a&gt; pirates, but it was taken over and used as a base of operations by Commodore &lt;a href=\"Fasil%20Umbranox\"&gt;Fasil Umbranox&lt;/a&gt; while he attempted to destroy the Red Sabre Pirates and for his hunt for the \"&lt;a href=\"Black%20Flag\"&gt;Black Flag&lt;/a&gt;\" and its captain &lt;a href=\"Torradan%20ap%20Dugal\"&gt;Torradan ap Dugal&lt;/a&gt;.\nDuring the battle in Anvil Bay between Umbranox and Torradan ap Dugal, the whole town was set on fire and destroyed. Dugal tried to flee, but Umbranox's battlemages caused a rocky outcropping to collapse over his ship so that it was destroyed. As a reward for destroying the pirates, Umbranox was given the title of &lt;a href=\"Count\"&gt;Count&lt;/a&gt; of Anvil, as well as the funds to build a city over the ashes of Old Anvil. He built &lt;a href=\"Castle%20Anvil\"&gt;Castle Anvil&lt;/a&gt; on the same island the Black Flag was buried under. Umbranox's descendants would rule for centuries afterwards.\nDuring the &lt;a href=\"Great%20War\"&gt;Great War&lt;/a&gt;, the city was put under siege by the armies of the &lt;a href=\"Aldmeri%20Dominion%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Aldmeri Dominion&lt;/a&gt;, which ended with a Dominion victory in &lt;a href=\"4E%20172\"&gt;4E 172&lt;/a&gt;."}

Often a letter being received starts a new quest. \nCharacteristics.\nThe courier may take up to 24 hours or more to deliver the letter, depending on how much the Dragonborn travels. They can also be found with messages to other people and will tell the Dragonborn that they are \"in a hurry.\" All couriers are either &lt;a href=\"Nords%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Nords&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Imperials%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Imperials&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Dunmer%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Dunmer&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"Bosmer%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Bosmer&lt;/a&gt;.\nEncounters.\nDragon Shout.\nA courier will bring a letter to the Dragonborn for the first time after they use a &lt;a href=\"dragon%20shout\"&gt;dragon shout&lt;/a&gt; in virtually any location. This activates a radiant &lt;a href=\"Quests%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;quest&lt;/a&gt;, in which the Dragonborn learns the locations of new &lt;a href=\"Word%20Walls%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Word Walls&lt;/a&gt; throughout Skyrim.\nLetters revealing the locations of Word Walls can be &lt;a href=\"stolen\"&gt;stolen&lt;/a&gt; from the couriers. This can sometimes result in the courier sending &lt;a href=\"Hired%20Thug\"&gt;Hired Thug&lt;/a&gt;s after the Dragonborn.\nHomestead.\nIn , couriers are one way of activating the process of buying a plot of land to build a &lt;a href=\"Homestead%20%28Hearthfire%29\"&gt;homestead&lt;/a&gt; on, as they will bring a letter from one of the three &lt;a href=\"Holds\"&gt;Holds&lt;/a&gt;.\nEnchanted weapons.\nCouriers can bring letters when the Dragonborn acquires certain &lt;a href=\"Enchanted%20Weapons%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;enchanted weapons&lt;/a&gt; or types of weapons or armor from vendors or from &lt;a href=\"Smithing%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;smithing&lt;/a&gt;/&lt;a href=\"Enchanting%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;enchanting&lt;/a&gt; them. These quests usually ask the Dragonborn to deliver said weapon to a rich researcher who offers suitable reward for bringing them the item. A good example is the \"&lt;a href=\"Letter%20from%20Calcemo\"&gt;Letter from Calcemo&lt;/a&gt;\".\nLetter of Inheritance.\nCouriers will deliver the \"&lt;a href=\"Letter%20of%20Inheritance\"&gt;Letter of Inheritance&lt;/a&gt;\" when someone close to the Dragonborn dies. Often, these letters are accompanied by various sums of .\nInns and taverns.\nCouriers can be found in inns across Skyrim. They do not deliver anything to the Dragonborn, but can be &lt;a href=\"pickpocket\"&gt;pickpocket&lt;/a&gt;ed for a radiant \"&lt;a href=\"Courier%27s%20Letter\"&gt;Courier's Letter&lt;/a&gt;\". Sometimes a courier may enter an inn or &lt;a href=\"Taverns%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;tavern&lt;/a&gt; but, if followed inside, will not be there.\n&lt;a href=\"Civil%20War%20Quests\"&gt;Civil War&lt;/a&gt;.\nCouriers may be found in the wild, either being a &lt;a href=\"Stormcloak\"&gt;Stormcloak&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"Imperial%20Legion%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Imperial&lt;/a&gt; courier. They run to an area and respond generically when talked to. They can also try to get the Dragonborn to join whatever faction they are affiliated with. If the courier wanders into an area controlled by the opposite faction, they will be attacked and killed. Despite being named Courier, these characters do not carry any messages, except during certain civil war quests.\n&lt;a href=\"Discerning%20the%20Transmundane\"&gt;Discerning the Transmundane&lt;/a&gt;.\nIf the Dragonborn has completed the first half of \"Discerning the Transmundane\" and has reached level 15, they will receive a \"&lt;a href=\"Letter%20from%20Septimus%20Signus\"&gt;Letter from Septimus Signus&lt;/a&gt;\".\n&lt;a href=\"Pieces%20of%20the%20Past\"&gt;Pieces of the Past&lt;/a&gt;.\nAfter the Dragonborn reaches level 20, a courier will deliver a \"&lt;a href=\"Museum%20Pamphlet\"&gt;Museum Pamphlet&lt;/a&gt;\" from &lt;a href=\"Silus%20Vesuius\"&gt;Silus Vesuius&lt;/a&gt; inviting them to visit his &lt;a href=\"Silus%20Vesuius%27s%20House\"&gt;Mythic Dawn Museum&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Dawnstar%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Dawnstar&lt;/a&gt;.\n&lt;a href=\"Repairing%20the%20Phial\"&gt;Repairing the Phial&lt;/a&gt;.\nAfter the quests \"&lt;a href=\"The%20White%20Phial%20%28Quest%29\"&gt;The White Phial&lt;/a&gt;\" and \"&lt;a href=\"Throat%20of%20the%20World%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Throat of the World&lt;/a&gt;\" have both been completed, a courier will deliver the \"&lt;a href=\"Letter%20from%20Quintus%20Navale\"&gt;Letter from Quintus Navale&lt;/a&gt;\" asking the Dragonborn to return there.\n&lt;a href=\"The%20Man%20Who%20Cried%20Wolf\"&gt;The Man Who Cried Wolf&lt;/a&gt;.\n&lt;a href=\"Elisif%20the%20Fair\"&gt;Elisif the Fair&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Falk%20Firebeard\"&gt;Falk Firebeard&lt;/a&gt; will both send a letter by courier to the Dragonborn upon completion of this quest, requesting their service once again.\n&lt;a href=\"With%20Friends%20Like%20These...\"&gt;With Friends Like These...&lt;/a&gt;.\nAfter killing &lt;a href=\"Grelod%20the%20Kind\"&gt;Grelod the Kind&lt;/a&gt; for &lt;a href=\"Aventus%20Aretino\"&gt;Aventus Aretino&lt;/a&gt;, a courier brings a \"&lt;a href=\"Mysterious%20Note%20%28Dark%20Brotherhood%29\"&gt;Mysterious Note&lt;/a&gt;\" to the Dragonborn from the &lt;a href=\"Dark%20Brotherhood%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Dark Brotherhood&lt;/a&gt;.\n&lt;a href=\"Unearthed%20%28Dragonborn%29\"&gt;Unearthed&lt;/a&gt;.\nVarious couriers will deliver notes from &lt;a href=\"Ralis%20Sedarys\"&gt;Ralis Sedarys&lt;/a&gt;.

It was an abandoned fort that now resembles an &lt;a href=\"Orc%20Stronghold\"&gt;Orc Stronghold&lt;/a&gt;; however, the Orcs that live there are hostile and will attack on sight. The keep is divided into three sections: Cracked Tusk Keep (Outer), Cracked Tusk Keep (Inner), and Cracked Tusk Keep Vault. The keep may be entered through two doors or a trap door on top of one tower.\nCracked Tusk Keep (Outer).\nTypical of most abandoned forts in Skyrim, the outer walls and towers are crumbling and broken in spots and the entire fort is in a general state of disrepair. The courtyard has a blacksmith's shop with a working &lt;a href=\"forge\"&gt;forge&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"grindstone\"&gt;grindstone&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"workbench\"&gt;workbench&lt;/a&gt;. What sets this fort apart is the additional Orcish construction in the outer yard due to this fort being occupied solely by hostile Orc bandits led by &lt;a href=\"Ghunzul\"&gt;Ghunzul&lt;/a&gt;, one of the guardians of the pieces of &lt;a href=\"Mehrunes%27%20Razor%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Mehrunes' Razor&lt;/a&gt;. In the courtyard, the Orcs have built a smokehouse and have a &lt;a href=\"tanning%20rack\"&gt;tanning rack&lt;/a&gt; nearby.\nCracked Tusk Keep (Inner).\nThe three-level inner keep may be accessed through either of two doors \u2014 one on the main level, one on the lower level with an adept lock, and a trap door in the roof of the tower. There are several rooms in this section, with the one on the lower level containing an &lt;a href=\"Alchemy%20Lab%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Alchemy Lab&lt;/a&gt;. The trapdoor from the tower leads into the room adjacent to Ghunzul's bedroom on the upper level. The main level has 6 usable bed rolls, should the player wish to sleep after clearing the keep of enemies.\nAfter slaying Ghunzul, collect the Cracked Tusk Vault Key from the end table (or from his corpse). The key will be useful for opening the locked cage on the lower level.\nCracked Tusk Vault.\nThe vault may be accessed on the lower level. Without the key to the cage, the player will need to pick the expert lock to the cage and then activate the button inside the cage. If you are playing in the third person mode, change to first person mode after opening the cage. Otherwise it only opens and closes the cage door instead of giving the button activate option. After activating the button, you can switch back.\nThe vault is a damp, stone corridor with a small, locked cell on each side and a larger cell at the end that contains traps for the unwary. The usual assortment of leveled treasure \u2014 potions, armor, and weapons \u2014 is located in various locations inside the vault, beyond which is a booby-trapped pedestal with the &lt;a href=\"Shards%20of%20Mehrunes%27%20Razor\"&gt;Shards of Mehrunes' Razor&lt;/a&gt; resting on it.\nThere are many traps in the lower vault, past the four adjacent rooms, leading up to the stand with the Shards. There are four tripwires that release poison darts, and well as a tripwire that activates a battering wall of to the side. The stand that holds the Shards itself will release poison darts once the Shards are removed.\nQuests.\n&lt;a href=\"Pieces%20of%20the%20Past\"&gt;Pieces of the Past&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Shards%20of%20Mehrunes%27%20Razor\"&gt;Shards of Mehrunes' Razor&lt;/a&gt; are found here."}

These styles play an important role in character customization and allows players to modify their character's appearance based on their preferences. Aside from the &lt;a href=\"Races%20%28Online%29\"&gt;racial&lt;/a&gt; styles, which are automatically learned dependent on the player character's race, all crafting styles require obtaining certain &lt;a href=\"crafting%20motifs\"&gt;crafting motifs&lt;/a&gt;, which in turn can be obtained by finding them as random loot, receiving them as rewards for completing &lt;a href=\"Random%20Encounters%20%28Online%29\"&gt;world events&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"repeatable%20quests\"&gt;repeatable quests&lt;/a&gt;, trading with &lt;a href=\"Merchants%20%28Online%29\"&gt;merchants&lt;/a&gt; or trading with other players. These Motifs allow the player to craft weapons and armor corresponding with its contents. Some crafting styles are only available to players that purchased special editions of the game or through purchase of an expansion.\nCertain &lt;a href=\"Crafting%20Materials\"&gt;materials&lt;/a&gt; are required to create different styles. These materials can be found as random loot, obtained through deconstructing an item of a particular style or they can be purchased from merchants. Alternatively, if one lacks the required materials to craft certain styles, they can purchase Crown Mimic Stones from the &lt;a href=\"Crown%20Store\"&gt;Crown Store&lt;/a&gt; to serve as a substitute. Crown Mimic Stones come in 3 packs:\nCrafting styles play a significant role in the player-driven economy of \"The Elder Scrolls Online\". Some motifs are rarer than others, making them highly sought after and driving up their prices in &lt;a href=\"guild%20stores\"&gt;guild stores&lt;/a&gt; or player-to-player trading. &lt;a href=\"Guilds%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Guilds&lt;/a&gt; may focus on mastering specific motifs or becoming experts in particular crafting styles, helping them establish themselves or attract certain customers. Likewise, individual players who specialize in crafting in rare styles can capitalize on this by selling items in these styles. As new motifs are released through limited-time events or &lt;a href=\"Updates%20%28Online%29\"&gt;updates&lt;/a&gt;, supply and demand may fluctuate, leading to price variation.\nCrafting styles enhance the crafting experience in \"The Elder Scrolls Online\" and offer the player an immersive experience, as well as providing them with unique challenges and opportunities to enhance their skills and economic prowess."}

Though quite the scoundrel, she does however hold her crew in high regard and does not leave them behind during the time they were all captured in Stros M'kai.\nAlthough she supports Captain Kaleen and her desire to keep the dangerous artifact at Betnikh to be used by the Daggerfall Covenant, Lerisa is still an independent swashbuckler who doesn't want to serve the crown. Once in Daggerfall, she tells the Vestige about her desire to reform her old crew and become her own captain once again.

It is a desolate region situated between &lt;a href=\"Hammerfell%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Hammerfell&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"High%20Rock%20%28Online%29\"&gt;High Rock&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Skyrim%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Skyrim&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Cyrodiil%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Cyrodiil&lt;/a&gt;.\nBackground.\nCraglorn is a region besieged by strange, otherworldly creatures, marauding &lt;a href=\"Orsimer%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Orsimer&lt;/a&gt;, and beings of immense power known as &lt;a href=\"Celestial\"&gt;Celestial&lt;/a&gt;s. An army of ancient, risen warriors of &lt;a href=\"Yokuda\"&gt;Yokuda&lt;/a&gt; lay siege in the west, led by the &lt;a href=\"Celestial%20Warrior\"&gt;Celestial Warrior&lt;/a&gt;, while &lt;a href=\"atronach\"&gt;atronach&lt;/a&gt;s defile the land in the east, under the command of the &lt;a href=\"Celestial%20Mage\"&gt;Celestial Mage&lt;/a&gt;. In the north, an army of &lt;a href=\"Iron%20Orcs\"&gt;Iron Orcs&lt;/a&gt; under the command of the &lt;a href=\"Celestial%20Serpent\"&gt;Celestial Serpent&lt;/a&gt; lays waste to the surrounding lands.\nThe main storyline of Craglorn revolves around the disappearance of the constellations and how the otherworldly Celestials; the Warrior, the Mage and the Serpent; are impacting Craglorn. The &lt;a href=\"Undaunted\"&gt;Undaunted&lt;/a&gt; have a major presence in the region due to the extreme dangers and potential adventure, making sorties into the ancient forts and ruins in the area now occupied by otherworldly creatures.\nLocations.\nThe following are locations accessible in Craglorn and, with the exception of &lt;a href=\"Unmarked%20Locations%20%28Online%29\"&gt;unmarked locations&lt;/a&gt;, are discoverable on the map. Points of Interest serve as locations with unique side quests, while &lt;a href=\"Cities%20%28Online%29\"&gt;cities&lt;/a&gt; serve as the centralised areas with multiple sublocations and act as a hub for services and &lt;a href=\"Merchants%20%28Online%29\"&gt;merchants&lt;/a&gt;. Explanations of the types of locations are provided in the &lt;a href=\"Locations%20%28Online%29%23Types\"&gt;main locations page&lt;/a&gt;.\nQuests.\nCraglorn features a series of zone story quests and unrelated side quests. The zone story quests are unrelated to other overarching storylines, and it is not necessary to complete the story quests for zones prior to those in Craglorn. Side quests are non-sequential and can be completed in any order, except where one carries on from another, and &lt;a href=\"repeatable%20quests\"&gt;repeatable quests&lt;/a&gt; can be completed multiple times: weekly for arenas and trials and daily for all others.\nItem Sets.\nItem sets are related armor and weapons that, when worn together, provide unique benefits. Overland sets can be acquired from world bosses, world events, delves, public dungeons and containers and as quest rewards; dungeon sets can be acquired from within group dungeons; monster sets can be acquired from the final boss of veteran group dungeons and Undaunted Enclaves; and crafted sets can be created at specific locations across the zone.\nSkyshards.\nEighteen Skyshards can be found in Craglorn totaling in six &lt;a href=\"skill%20points\"&gt;skill points&lt;/a&gt;. The zone guide provides clues as to the location of each Skyshard, but many can be found simply by exploring and watching for the distinctive pillar of light they emit. Skyshards will appear on the map and compass when the Vestige is close to one and will remain discovered on the map even if it was not collected.\nAchievements.\nAchievements can be earned by completing specific tasks such as completing quests and discovering locations. Achievements are separated into categories and their progress is viewable from the journal. Earning achievement provides the Vestige a number of points, and some achievements unlock unique rewards such as &lt;a href=\"Furnishings%20%28Online%29\"&gt;furnishings&lt;/a&gt; that can be bought from Achievement Furnishers or &lt;a href=\"collectibles\"&gt;collectibles&lt;/a&gt;.\nFish.\nFish can be caught from fishing hotspots, ideally with the correct &lt;a href=\"bait\"&gt;bait&lt;/a&gt;. Common fish will be caught most often while rare fish and alternative bait are rare catches. Each zone has unique rare fish than can be caught from hotspots. &lt;a href=\"Slaughterfish%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Slaughterfish&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"trodh\"&gt;trodh&lt;/a&gt; can be caught from foul hotspots, &lt;a href=\"dhufish\"&gt;dhufish&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"longfin\"&gt;longfin&lt;/a&gt; can be caught from saltwater hotspots, &lt;a href=\"silverside%20perch\"&gt;silverside perch&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"spadetail\"&gt;spadetail&lt;/a&gt; can be caught from lake hotspots, and &lt;a href=\"Salmon%20%28Online%29\"&gt;salmon&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"River%20Betty%20%28Online%29\"&gt;river betty&lt;/a&gt; can be caught from river hotspots. &lt;a href=\"Chub\"&gt;Chub&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"minnow\"&gt;minnow&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"shad\"&gt;shad&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"fish%20roe\"&gt;fish roe&lt;/a&gt; can be caught and used as bait from foul, saltwater, lake and river hotspots, respectively."}

There is one sitting outside of this small cave at a table that frequently runs off in pursuit of wildlife nearby (making &lt;a href=\"Fast%20Travel%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;fast travel&lt;/a&gt; coming out difficult). There is often a &lt;a href=\"Dragons%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;dragon&lt;/a&gt; flying overhead.\nThe Conjurers in the cave are &lt;a href=\"Leveled%20Creatures%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;leveled&lt;/a&gt; and can quickly swarm. Between them and their conjured creatures it is not advisable to rush in too quickly. There are also free roaming &lt;a href=\"atronach\"&gt;atronach&lt;/a&gt;s.\nIn addition to the plethora of &lt;a href=\"Soul%20Gem%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;soul gems&lt;/a&gt; in the cave, there is also a &lt;a href=\"Skill%20Books%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;skill book&lt;/a&gt; in the second to last room on a table. There are also two &lt;a href=\"Alchemy%20Lab%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;alchemy labs&lt;/a&gt; and an &lt;a href=\"Arcane%20Enchanter%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;arcane enchanter&lt;/a&gt; in this cave.\nWalkthrough.\nUpon approaching the cave, the &lt;a href=\"Last%20Dragonborn\"&gt;Dragonborn&lt;/a&gt; will find a leveled Conjurer (who will often be battling with local wildlife, i.e. a &lt;a href=\"Sabre%20Cat%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;sabre cat&lt;/a&gt;). Just northeast of the cave entrance is an iron ore vein. On the Conjurer's table, there are some &lt;a href=\"Potions%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;potions&lt;/a&gt; and a soul gem.\nUpon entering the cave, go right (south) down the small cavern. In the room following, there is a leveled Conjurer and an alchemy lab. On the alchemy lab's table there is a potion and a soul gem. After looting, continue up the path to the east.\nIn the next room there is a flame atronach to battle, along with more leveled Conjurers. Be very careful in this pathway, as loud battle will attract a plethora of enemies. In the next room, after finishing off another Conjurer, take the soul gem that is next to the &lt;a href=\"Pickaxe%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;pickaxe&lt;/a&gt; in the bowl in the center of the room, then continue up the path. On the upper level, there are various &lt;a href=\"Food%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;food&lt;/a&gt; items and &lt;a href=\"Ingredients%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;ingredients&lt;/a&gt;. After looting, continue down the path to the south.\nDown the path and to the left (south) the Dragonborn will find a room with &lt;a href=\"Leveled%20Items%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;leveled loot&lt;/a&gt;, and an unlocked chest along the west wall. After looting this room, head back to the path to the next big cavern.\nIn this room, there is a frost atronach guarding the circular room in the middle of the cavern. Engaging him will attract a leveled Conjurer and their familiar. After killing them, up the stairs to the right (north) is an area with loot. Up the stairs to the left (south) is another area with loot and another alchemy lab. Then, head into the circular room to collect from the chest along the south wall. Behind this chest (through the hole in the wall), there is another unlocked chest. Also be sure to check the table for potions, a soul gem, the &lt;a href=\"Alteration%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Alteration&lt;/a&gt; skill book \"&lt;a href=\"The%20Lunar%20Lorkhan\"&gt;The Lunar Lorkhan&lt;/a&gt;,\" and \"&lt;a href=\"The%20Legend%20of%20Red%20Eagle%20%28Book%29\"&gt;The Legend of Red Eagle&lt;/a&gt;\" (a book which starts another mission if read). Also, be sure to take another soul gem from the shelf along the north wall. After looting (and checking out the arcane enchanter also in this room), continue down the pathway to the west.\nTurning up to the north, the Dragonborn will come to a small area with a leveled Conjurer. After decimating them, loot the adept-locked chest along the east wall. Then, continue up to the west.\nTurning south, the Dragonborn will come to a ledge (one they probably saw earlier after entering the cave). Jump down and exit to your right (west)."}

Talking to her about business will reveal that Hlaalu's ebony trade is under threat. The &lt;a href=\"East%20Empire%20Company\"&gt;East Empire Company&lt;/a&gt;'s base in &lt;a href=\"Vvardenfell%20%28Morrowind%29\"&gt;Vvardenfell&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Ebonheart%20%28Morrowind%29\"&gt;Ebonheart&lt;/a&gt;, has threatened to buy ebony from &lt;a href=\"House%20Redoran\"&gt;House Redoran&lt;/a&gt; unless Hlaalu reduces their prices. The Nerevarine is given a choice by Dorvayn to solve this solution: they may either speak to &lt;a href=\"Canctunian%20Ponius\"&gt;Canctunian Ponius&lt;/a&gt; (a representative of the East Empire Company in Ebonheart) and convince him to continue to purchase Hlaalu ebony, or kill &lt;a href=\"Darns%20Tedalen\"&gt;Darns Tedalen&lt;/a&gt; (head of mining at &lt;a href=\"Sudanit%20Mine\"&gt;Sudanit Mine&lt;/a&gt;) to shut down the Redoran controlled Sudanit Mine.\nWalkthrough.\nOption One: A chat with Ponius.\nThe first option available to the Nerevarine is to persuade the East Empire Company's representative in Ebonheart to continue to buy ebony from Hlaalu. In order to persuade him to lengthen the Company's contract with Hlaalu about ebony, the Nerevarine must raise his &lt;a href=\"disposition\"&gt;disposition&lt;/a&gt; above 75. Once this has been achieved the Nerevarine must return to Dorvayn to tell her the good news.\nOption Two: Closing the Competition.\nThe second option offered by Dorvayn is to shut down the Redoran controlled mine of Sudanit, southeast of the Buckmoth Legion Fort. To shut the mine down, the Nerevarine must kill the Head of Mining at the site, Darns Tedalen. Tedalen is guarded by House Redoran guards, so killing him may cause problems (he must also be provoked into attacking or the Nerevarine will receive a bounty for their troubles.\nThe Nerevarine may return to Nileno Dorvayn after this point. If one of the two options has been carried out, then the Nerevarine will receive 1,000 . If, however, they completed both options then the Nerevarine will not only receive the gold, but also a pair of &lt;a href=\"Glass%20Boots%20%28Morrowind%29\"&gt;glass boots&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Glass%20Greaves%20%28Morrowind%29\"&gt;greaves&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Glass%20Cuirass%20%28Morrowind%29\"&gt;cuirass&lt;/a&gt;."}

There are six eras of Tamriel, each denoting a significant time period and change.\nThe Dawn Era.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Dawn%20Era\"&gt;Dawn Era&lt;/a&gt; is the era in which time began and the world was created. It was a time of chaos and magic where gods walked &lt;a href=\"Nirn\"&gt;Nirn&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href=\"Elf\"&gt;Elven&lt;/a&gt; history begins after the Cosmos stabilizes when &lt;a href=\"Magnus\"&gt;Magnus&lt;/a&gt; leaves the world of Nirn and &lt;a href=\"Lorkhan\"&gt;Lorkhan&lt;/a&gt; is condemned for creation of the mortal plane. It begins with the emergence of &lt;a href=\"Anu\"&gt;Anu&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Padomay\"&gt;Padomay&lt;/a&gt; and ends with the &lt;a href=\"Convention\"&gt;Convention&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe Merethic Era.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Merethic%20Era\"&gt;Merethic Era&lt;/a&gt; is the era that begins when a linear timeline can be discerned. This era begins in &lt;a href=\"ME%202500\"&gt;ME 2500&lt;/a&gt;;the earliest date to be recorded by &lt;a href=\"King%20Harald\"&gt;King Harald&lt;/a&gt;'s scribes, and goes backwards to &lt;a href=\"1E%201\"&gt;1E 1&lt;/a&gt; (the first year of the first era). Some notable events of the Merethic Era include the construction of the &lt;a href=\"Adamantine%20Tower\"&gt;Adamantine Tower&lt;/a&gt; (ME 2500), the exodus of the &lt;a href=\"Aldmeri\"&gt;Aldmeri&lt;/a&gt; peoples from their ancestral homeland of &lt;a href=\"Aldmeris\"&gt;Aldmeris&lt;/a&gt; and the settling of the vast coasts of Tamriel, and later the exodus of the Atmorans from the continent of &lt;a href=\"Atmora\"&gt;Atmora&lt;/a&gt;, the ancestors of the &lt;a href=\"Nords\"&gt;Nords&lt;/a&gt;, who begin settling the northern coasts of Tamriel. The era ends with the founding of the &lt;a href=\"Camoran%20Dynasty\"&gt;Camoran Dynasty&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Valenwood\"&gt;Valenwood&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe First Era.\nThe &lt;a href=\"First%20Era\"&gt;First Era&lt;/a&gt; is a very long era that lasted for 2,920 years and is marked by a visible shift in power between the Elven and &lt;a href=\"Human\"&gt;Human&lt;/a&gt; races, with the success of the &lt;a href=\"Alessian%20Rebellion\"&gt;Alessian Rebellion&lt;/a&gt; and shattering of the &lt;a href=\"Ayleid%20Empire\"&gt;Ayleid Empire&lt;/a&gt;.

The most notable events of the First Era include the formation of the first &lt;a href=\"Orsinium\"&gt;Orsinium&lt;/a&gt;, the first kingdom of &lt;a href=\"Skyrim\"&gt;Skyrim&lt;/a&gt;, the first empire of the Nords, and the first \"&lt;a href=\"Alessian%20Empire\"&gt;Empire of Man&lt;/a&gt;\" led by &lt;a href=\"Saint%20Alessia\"&gt;Saint Alessia&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe Second Era.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Second%20Era\"&gt;Second Era&lt;/a&gt; lasted 896 years, beginning with the death of the Reman dynasty at the hands of the &lt;a href=\"Morag%20Tong\"&gt;Morag Tong&lt;/a&gt;, and ending with &lt;a href=\"Tiber%20Septim\"&gt;Tiber Septim&lt;/a&gt;'s harnessing of the &lt;a href=\"Numidium\"&gt;Numidium&lt;/a&gt; and bringing peace to &lt;a href=\"Tamriel\"&gt;Tamriel&lt;/a&gt;. The more notable of the events of this Era include the assassination of Potentate Versidue-Shaie and later his son &lt;a href=\"Savirien-Chorak\"&gt;Savirien-Chorak&lt;/a&gt; and all his heirs, ending the second Empire of Men and causing the &lt;a href=\"Interregnum\"&gt;Interregnum&lt;/a&gt;. This period was also marked by the &lt;a href=\"Three%20Banners%20War\"&gt;Three Banners War&lt;/a&gt; between the &lt;a href=\"Ebonheart%20Pact\"&gt;Ebonheart Pact&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Daggerfall%20Covenant\"&gt;Daggerfall Covenant&lt;/a&gt;, and the &lt;a href=\"First%20Aldmeri%20Dominion\"&gt;First Aldmeri Dominion&lt;/a&gt; over the &lt;a href=\"Ruby%20Throne\"&gt;Ruby Throne&lt;/a&gt;, while the elven &lt;a href=\"Necromancy\"&gt;necromancer&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Mannimarco%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Mannimarco&lt;/a&gt; ruled the Empire and worked with the &lt;a href=\"Daedric%20Prince\"&gt;Daedric Prince&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Molag%20Bal\"&gt;Molag Bal&lt;/a&gt;, who wished to drag the mortal plane into his own plane of &lt;a href=\"Oblivion%20%28Realm%29\"&gt;Oblivion&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Coldharbour\"&gt;Coldharbour&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe Third Era.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Third%20Era\"&gt;Third Era&lt;/a&gt; was a rather short era that lasted 433 years (it is the era in which the first four main entry \"Elder Scrolls\" games occur). This era began when Tiber Septim united all of Tamriel under the banner of the &lt;a href=\"Empire\"&gt;Empire&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Septim%20Dynasty\"&gt;Septim Dynasty&lt;/a&gt; begins. Since the beginning of the Third Empire of Men, there have been many civil wars and revolts against the Empire's rule. Notable events of the &lt;a href=\"Third%20Era\"&gt;Third Era&lt;/a&gt; include the &lt;a href=\"Nerevarine\"&gt;Nerevarine&lt;/a&gt;'s victory over &lt;a href=\"Dagoth%20Ur%20%28Character%29\"&gt;Dagoth Ur&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Akulakhan\"&gt;Akulakhan&lt;/a&gt;, the second eruption of &lt;a href=\"Red%20Mountain\"&gt;Red Mountain&lt;/a&gt;, and the assassination of &lt;a href=\"Uriel%20Septim%20VII\"&gt;Uriel Septim VII&lt;/a&gt;, which would lead to the &lt;a href=\"Oblivion%20Crisis\"&gt;Oblivion Crisis&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href=\"Martin%20Septim\"&gt;Martin Septim&lt;/a&gt;'s sacrifice during the Crisis marks the end of both the Septim bloodline and the Third Era.\nThe Fourth Era.\nThe Fourth Era begins with the end of the Septim bloodline during the events of . It marks the rise of the &lt;a href=\"Thalmor\"&gt;Thalmor&lt;/a&gt; and the establishment and rise of the &lt;a href=\"Third%20Aldmeri%20Dominion\"&gt;Third Aldmeri Dominion&lt;/a&gt;, as well as the &lt;a href=\"Great%20War\"&gt;Great War&lt;/a&gt; with the Third Empire. The last known year of the Fourth Era is 4E 201, the year in which the &lt;a href=\"Dragon%20Crisis\"&gt;Dragon Crisis&lt;/a&gt; occurred and the &lt;a href=\"Last%20Dragonborn\"&gt;Last Dragonborn&lt;/a&gt; rose to combat the World Eater, &lt;a href=\"Alduin\"&gt;Alduin&lt;/a&gt;."}

The current leader, the Ashkhan, a \"war-loving Erabenimsun,\" &lt;a href=\"Ulath-Pal\"&gt;Ulath-Pal&lt;/a&gt;, is an incompetent arrogant and will never agree to naming the Hero Erabenimsun Nerevarine.

However, when speaking to Han-Ammu, it is revealed that he is not keen to become the Ashkhan, largely due to the fact that he thinks he does not possess the attributes of a warrior and a leader. In order to persuade him to become the Ashkhan, the Nerevarine must give him three items: the &lt;a href=\"War%20Axe%20of%20Airan%20Ammu\"&gt;War Axe of Airan Ammu&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Sanit-Kil%27s%20Heart%20of%20Fire\"&gt;Sanit-Kil's Heart of Fire&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Robe%20of%20Erur-Dan%20the%20Wise\"&gt;Robe of Erur-Dan the Wise&lt;/a&gt;, all of which were previously looted from the dead \"war-loving Erabenimsun.\" Once these items are given to Han-Ammu, along with a speech, he agrees to become the Ashkhan and will grant the Hero the title of Erabenimsun Nerevarine.

Realizing that they could not hope to defeat the Orcs, and desperate to keep the &lt;a href=\"Skull%20of%20Corruption%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Skull of Corruption&lt;/a&gt; safe, the priests decided to release \"&lt;a href=\"the%20Miasma\"&gt;the Miasma&lt;/a&gt;,\" a mist of sorts that puts people into a deep sleep. Erandur, then named Brother Casimir, was the one to release it, but before the miasma could take him, he fled, leaving his fellow priests to die. It was an act that haunts him to this day.\nPriesthood of Mara.\nHe spent a few years wandering Skyrim until he was taken in by a priest of Mara. He decided to become a priest of Mara himself, although he did have trouble adjusting from the dark and brutal ways of Vaermina to the kind and loving ways of Mara. His fellow priests patiently helped him through the process, and now he has gone back to Dawnstar, where he has to deal with Vaermina's influence on the people.\nInteractions.\n&lt;a href=\"Waking%20Nightmare\"&gt;Waking Nightmare&lt;/a&gt;.\nSpeaking with the &lt;a href=\"Jarl\"&gt;Jarl&lt;/a&gt; of Dawnstar, the Dragonborn learns of a fatal condition pervading the citizens of Dawnstar. Several fall asleep indefinitely, while others complain of dreadful nightmares.\nFinding Erandur in the Windpeak Inn, the Dragonborn agrees to follow him to Nightcaller Temple and end the streak of nightmares. There, it is revealed that the Dragonborn must enter the memories of Erandur, using &lt;a href=\"Vaermina%27s%20Torpor\"&gt;Vaermina's Torpor&lt;/a&gt;, an &lt;a href=\"Alchemy%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;alchemical draught&lt;/a&gt;, which reveals Erandur as a former &lt;a href=\"Vaermina%20Devotee\"&gt;Vaermina cultist&lt;/a&gt;. Succeeding, Erandur and the Dragonborn proceed toward the altar of the temple, hoping to destroy the Skull of Corruption and end the nightmares occurring in Dawnstar.\nThe two are attacked by Veren and Thorek, priests of Vaermina, who accuse Erandur of fleeing from the battle and not falling into a paralytic sleep. Defeating them, the Dragonborn has the option to allow Erandur to perform a ritual and destroy the Skull of Corruption, or take it for themselves. Before making the decision, Vaermina calls out to the Dragonborn, promising great power if he or she chooses to slay Erandur. Choosing to obey rewards them with the Skull of Corruption, while refusing opens Erandur as a follower.\nConversations.\nCasimir.\nErandur: \"Wait... Veren...

Erandur was a &lt;a href=\"Necromancer%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;necromancer&lt;/a&gt;, while his lifelong friend, Vangaril, however, was quite innocent. Devoting himself to guiding his friend away from the Dark Arts, Vangaril ultimately failed when Erandur transformed himself into a lich. Setting out to slay the lich and save his friend's soul, Vangaril journeyed to Lost Boy Cavern, where Erandur had taken up abode.\nVangaril succeeded in slaying the lich's physical form, yet failed in properly banishing it. Believing he had completed his goal, Vangaril stayed in the cave to study the tombs left behind, in the hopes that he could better prepare himself to face any other lich he encountered. Ultimately, he became corrupted by his friend's power, thus becoming\u00a0a lich himself, taking both his friend's name and his own.\nThis lich, having absorbed both Erandur and Vangaril, is known as Erandur-Vangaril henceforward. He soon declared war with the mages guild and sent them several letters, becoming increasingly dark in his intentions and loyalties to &lt;a href=\"Mannimarco%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;Mannimarco&lt;/a&gt;.\nInteractions.\nLich of Lost Boy Cavern.\nErandur-Vangaril cannot be interacted with before the &lt;a href=\"Hero%20of%20Kvatch\"&gt;Hero&lt;/a&gt; reaches level twenty-three. If entering the cave before that time, Erandur-Vangaril will not interact with them nor can he be attacked."}

My research on ancient artifacts has led me across the sands of Elsweyr and the forests of Valenwood, and now, it has led me to the inhospitable north of Skyrim.\nMy quarry is that of Goldbrand, a golden katana said to have been forged by &lt;a href=\"Dragon%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;dragons&lt;/a&gt; and embodies the power of the Daedric Prince &lt;a href=\"Boethiah%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Boethiah&lt;/a&gt;. The blade has passed through many hands, most recently those of &lt;a href=\"Emperor%20Titus%20Mede%20II\"&gt;Emperor Titus Mede II&lt;/a&gt;. He was rumored to have possessed it during the &lt;a href=\"Battle%20of%20the%20Red%20Ring\"&gt;Battle of the Red Ring&lt;/a&gt;.\nAfter the battle, Mede II (or one of his agents) had it returned to the tomb of the one said to have originally possessed the blade: Sivdur, an ancient Nord warrior who fought in defense of the dragons. And there, in Sivdur's Respite, is where Goldbrand is said to reside. Mede II was said to have felt that he lacked the right to claim the blade, and that it should return to the one it was first entrusted.\nNo direct record of the location of Sivdur's Respite exists in the Imperial archives. However, I discovered a strange missive on a mission involving precious cargo, and along with it, a map. As it turns out, this was the only record of the mission to return Goldbrand to Skyrim, and the map led to Sivdur's Respite. It lies in a cave in the mountains just north of &lt;a href=\"Windhelm%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Windhelm&lt;/a&gt;!\nBased on my findings there, I have other business to attend to now. It would seem I have some traveling yet to do. I have documented my findings in a separate journal on the topic.\n15 Sun's Height\nI am starting to believe I may have attracted unwanted attention. A group of dangerous cultists who worship the Daedric Prince Boethiah are said to gather near Windhelm, and Goldbrand's whereabouts would no doubt be of interest to them. Already I feel like I see the same faces as I pass strangers along the road.\nI should be careful."}

The entrance of Sivdur's tomb remains surprisingly intact. I hope that the interior remains equally well-preserved. That is, assuming &lt;a href=\"Titus%20Mede%20II\"&gt;Titus Mede II&lt;/a&gt; elected not to pillage the entire ruin over two decades ago when Goldbrand was allegedly returned to Sivdur's side. One can only hope he exercised restraint.\nIt appears the burial chamber is locked using an ancient mechanical system, and only by placing the correct objects on the pedestals flanking the chamber's entrance will the path open. Fascinating!\nI must research where to find the relics required to open the chamber. I shall return when I have answers.\n23 Sun's Height\nThe inscriptions relate to two ancient relics. The first is Sivdur's amulet, inscribed with the symbols of his rank and honorifics. The second is the skull of Sivdur's betrayer and lifelong enemy, Magrathi. Sivdur, never having exacted revenge in his time, now calls out to us from the beyond to defile his enemy's resting place, and place the skull near his sacred burial chamber as a sort of trophy. Morbid, but not uncommon for the period.\nI will now go out in search of the relics that will lead to the opening of the tomb. I have left my &lt;a href=\"Eranya%27s%20Research%20Notes\"&gt;notes&lt;/a&gt; where I conducted my research, in the &lt;a href=\"The%20Arcanaeum\"&gt;Arcanaeum&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;a href=\"College%20of%20Winterhold%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;College of Winterhold&lt;/a&gt;.

I shall start with texts on ancient Nord heroes and work backwards from there.\n13 Sun's Height\nNo luck thus far. Discouraging, but I will not . The answers must lie in these walls somewhere.\n14 Sun's Height\nA breakthrough! It has been recorded that Sivdur's amulet has been passed down from father to son for generations. If my tracing of the lineages is correct, the current living of Sivdur are the &lt;a href=\"Battle-Born\"&gt;Battle-Born&lt;/a&gt;s, a clan that resides in the city of &lt;a href=\"Whiterun%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Whiterun&lt;/a&gt;.

I must inquire with them.\n19 Sun's Height\nDetails are sparse, but Magrathi appears to once have been an &lt;a href=\"Dragon%20Priests\"&gt;influential priest&lt;/a&gt; of the &lt;a href=\"Dragon%20Cult\"&gt;dragon cult&lt;/a&gt;. He seems to have slain Sivdur's brother over rightful ownership of a silver mine. He is said to have been laid to rest in &lt;a href=\"Shroud%20Hearth%20Barrow%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Shroud Hearth Barrow&lt;/a&gt; near &lt;a href=\"Ivarstead%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Ivarstead&lt;/a&gt;.\nI will now return to Sivdur's Respite, take some &lt;a href=\"Eranya%27s%20Notes%20on%20Sivdur%27s%20Tomb\"&gt;additional notes&lt;/a&gt;, and then travel east to Windhelm where a few good sellswords might be found that can help with this treacherous undertaking."}

I envy you that. In fact, maybe you can help me with something.\"\nWhat is it that you need? \"I want to be an adventurer like you, but my father says I can't. He says that he needs me to stay here and work the farm, and even if he did let me be an adventurer, we couldn't afford to buy armor. His name's Mralki, and he's the innkeeper here. I hope you can change his mind.\"\nYour crops seem to be thriving \"It's true. For as long as I can remember our crops have always done well. I'm not sure whether it's the soil, the climate or the favor of the Divines, but we've never had a poor harvest.\"\nHave you lived here all your life? \"Born and raised right here in Rorikstead. My father was a soldier. He fought in the great war and when it was over, he retired here to raise a family. My mother passed away when I was just a babe, so he did his best to raise me on his own. It's not the most exciting place in the world, but the people here work hard and don't cause trouble for anyone.\"\nI haven't spoken to him yet. \"Can't blame you for having better things to do than help some farmer you don't know.\"\nYour father changed his mind. \"I can't thank you enough, friend. I'll hope you'll come back to Rorikstead soon and pay me a visit. Maybe we can swap stories about our adventures over a mug of ale at the inn!\"\nFollower.\nFollow me. \"Great!

Be careful now!\"\nIt's time for us to part ways. \"Well, it's been fun. I guess I'll head back to Rorikstead.\" (The second sentence is tinged with disappointment.)\nConversations.\nJouane.\n&lt;a href=\"Jouane%20Manette\"&gt;Jouane&lt;/a&gt;: \"Anything I can pick up for you on my next trip into the city, Erik?\"\nErik: \"Thanks for the offer, Jouane, but I'm saving up for a new sword.\"\nLemkil.\nErik: \"I'm not saying it's my business, but I have to ask. Why are you so cruel to your little girls?\"\n&lt;a href=\"Lemkil\"&gt;Lemkil&lt;/a&gt;: \"You're right, it's none of your business. How about you keep your nose out of it?\"\nErik: \"You keep on like you are, you'll end up with two daughters who hate you.\"\nLemkil: \"Hah! And what would a witless oaf like you know about raising children?\"\nMralki.\nErik: \"Father, how old were you when you left home?\"\nMralki: \"I know where this is going, son. As I've said many a time. the world is a dangerous place. You're much safer here at the farm, with me.\"\nErik: \"But I don't want to be safe! I'm not afraid of the dangers out there. The only thing I'm afraid of is wasting my life on this farm.\"\nMralki: \"Yes, that's your mother's side of the family talking. Just stay on for one more season, that's all I ask.\"\nMralki: \"I heard you sneaking around downstairs last night. Were you trying to break into my chest again, son? I've told you to leave it alone.\"\nErik: \"I just wanted to try on your old armor, from back when you were a soldier. I thought I might be old enough to wear it.\"\nMralki: \"I've told you a hundred times, I lock that chest for a reason. I don't want you getting a head full of ideas about adventure and glory.\"\nErik: \"I'm old enough to decide how to live my life, and I'd be honored to wear your armor, if you'd just let me. I'm strong enough to handle it.\"\nMralki: \"Strong, yes, but how clever are you? I'll tell you what, if you can open the lock on my chest, you can have everything in it.\"\nErik: \"I'll take your challenge, but if I win I get to start a new life as an adventurer, and with no objections from you.\"\nStatistics.\nBeing classed as a &lt;a href=\"barbarian\"&gt;barbarian&lt;/a&gt;, Erik's greatest strengths are in the use of two-handed weapons and light armor. He also makes a fairly good archer at long range. He can use a one-handed weapon/shield combo, but his skill with one-handed weapons is average at best.\nIronically, although his default equipment is a set of heavy armor, he is unskilled in heavy armor usage and receives minimum protection from it. He also starts out with a one-handed sword, but this can be removed from his inventory and replaced with a better two-handed weapon through trading."}

Furthermore, Erik adds that his father, &lt;a href=\"Mralki\"&gt;Mralki&lt;/a&gt;, is not willing to allow it, and would like the &lt;a href=\"Last%20Dragonborn\"&gt;Dragonborn&lt;/a&gt; to persuade Mralki change his mind.\nAs Mralki is the town's innkeeper, he is usually found serving as a bartender behind the counter at the far end of the inn.

An offering of gold to pay for armor to outfit Erik, or some stern words, is enough to change his mind.\nOnce Erik is informed of Mralki's new disposition by the Dragonborn, he will say that perhaps one day, their stories of adventure can be swapped over a mug of &lt;a href=\"Ale%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;ale&lt;/a&gt;.

After being cheated by the captain of the &lt;a href=\"Dainty%20Sload\"&gt;Dainty Sload&lt;/a&gt;, Erikur contracts the Thieves Guild to frame him for possession of the illegal drug &lt;a href=\"Balmora%20Blue\"&gt;Balmora Blue&lt;/a&gt;.\nKilling him prior to the quest will render it impossible to complete. By extension, the &lt;a href=\"Achievements%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;achievement&lt;/a&gt; \"One with The Shadows\" cannot be collected with him dead.\nOther interactions.\nKilling Erikur causes &lt;a href=\"hired%20thugs\"&gt;hired thugs&lt;/a&gt; to come to a city that the Dragonborn is in shortly after, and the thugs drop a \"&lt;a href=\"Contract%20%28Book%29\"&gt;Contract&lt;/a&gt;\".

Yes, I've heard about all that fuss. I myself know it's all a terrible, terrible misunderstanding. I'm quite sure you're innocent in all this. This one time only, I'll grant you special immunity for any past transgressions, real or perceived. But going forward, I'm sure you realize that your fate is in your own hands.

You think you can toy with me, is that it? No, my dear. I have my heart set on you, and I always get what I want.\"\nBrelas: \"I'm sorry, sir. I didn't mean to give you the wrong impression earlier. I meant no disrespect.\"\nErikur: \"Oh, don't worry. I'll let you make it up to me. Now, where can we go for a little privacy, hmm?\"\nBrelas: \"No, I'm sorry, but I can't go anywhere with you.

As long as those dogs stay outside of our borders, we're fine.\"\nBryling: \"The Stormcloaks are far from the only threat to the hold.

Barring any... fancy and folly... the good people of Haafingar are surely capable of dealing with the odd highwayman or stray dog.\"\nBryling: \"Trouble on the roads and cities means less commerce. Less commerce means less money and more starving people. And that means more crime.\"\nErikur: \"Humph.

However, we have little food or water to spare.\"\nErikur: \"\"&lt;a href=\"General%20Tullius%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;General Tullius&lt;/a&gt; will never allow that.

Or have you forgotten your oaths of fealty?\"\nErikur: \"My apologies, Jarl Elisif.

Perhaps this is a matter best discussed with the general in person.\"\nFalk: \"I will make the arrangements, my Jarl.\"\nErikur: \"I've heard the Empire plans to levy a tax on our trading ships. Falk, you've got to do something about this.\"\nFalk: \"General Tullius needs more money for the war effort.

All the water around it turns black, all the fish die, all the wind and roar is quieted. Its five heads rake and bite one another, crying with their dissonant voices. And despite the perverse knotting and writhing of its heads the creature still plods forward, sowing destruction as it does. One of the heads is little more than rotting flesh and bone, and even as it roars I see the bottom-feeders of the ocean depths feasting on its putrid flesh. With its every roar the dead tremble and dance, puppets on strings before its unholy power.\nA second head bore pustules and pox-scars, bulbous blisters of fluid that glowed in crimson and cyan\u2014these would burst, oozing their contents into one another, and these horrible concoctions would hiss and sputter, burn and smoke. The others would lap this fouled fluid with glee and dismay.\nA third head was black as a night without stars, as onyx in a windowless room. And darker still were its eyes, pulling the shadows made long by the sun into a shroud of pure darkness.\nThe fourth head was obscured to me. I could not discern its features.\nBut the last, the fifth head\u2014so terrible it was to behold, for it was several times the size of the others. By its screeching only would the others tremble and quell their fighting. This massive head was little more than a ring of teeth, seated upon which was a terrible brain\u2014a loathsome mottled thing, its wrinkles and folds undulating in a sinister and nauseating series of pulses. Strands of ichor and bile seeped from its fleshy recesses as barnacles and polyps, affixed to its surface, seemed to gasp for want of air.\nThen the creature's heads turned their attentions to me. I was frozen, am frozen, will always be frozen by the eyes raking over me, and worse still is the song they sang in unison, a ruinous cacophony:\nKetor-A, En-Garsa! Bekor-gen, Zema-ja!\nUlvorkus waits,\nUlvorkus wakes,\nKetor-A, En-Garsa! Bekor-gen, Zema-ja!\nAnd at the apex of this terrible verse, as the sun gave way to terrible night, I would see the outline on a distant horizon\u2014a mountain forming from the sea. And falling into the water from this peak were more creatures\u2014too many to count, too horrible to name.\nThey are coming.\nThey are coming for us.\nAnd when the sun goes down completely, I wake up screaming."}

On top of that, he gets along with everyone. It doesn't matter if they're short people, fat people, tall people, or cat people. That's the thing about my old friend Gunther, he doesn't judge.\nAnyways, when I got to Skyrim, I sold most of the loot we piled up over the years, seeing as wanted men have to travel light. The heaviest piece I sold was a set of Daedric mail, to a caravan Khajiit named &lt;a href=\"Ma%27dran\"&gt;Ma'dran&lt;/a&gt;. I liked that armor, but in the end I had no choice but to get rid of her. She knows what she did.\nBesides, if I wanted to get her back, I could always trade something of equal value, like the &lt;a href=\"Ring%20of%20Masser\"&gt;Ring of Masser&lt;/a&gt; I ripped off the merchant at the Crescent Moons Inn way back when. Me and the furballs, we have history.\nThe ring is worth at least two sets of armor, or twenty pairs of boots. It can fortify your illusion magic, just like the books say. The books get a lot right, even the parts about me, except I'm much prettier and taller in real life. \nEither way, I don't need to cast spells to run this new crew. So I'll let my best friend Gunther wear the ring. I think it looks really good on him."}

The Akaviri were not a straightforward people. Everything is couched in allegory and mythic symbolism. Yes, yes. This here, coming from the mouths of the Nord heroes -- this is the Akaviri symbol for \"Shout.\" But... there's no way to know what Shout is meant.\"\"\nDelphine: \"You mean they used a shout to defeat Alduin? You're sure?\"\nEsbern: \"Hmm? Oh, yes. Presumably something rather specific to dragons, or even Alduin himself. Remember, this is where they recorded all they knew of Alduin and his return.\"\nDelphine: \"So we're looking for a Shout, then. Damn it.\"\nEsbern: \"Look, here. In the third panel. The prophecy which brought the Akaviri to Tamriel in the first place, in search of the Dragonborn. Here are the Akaviri - the Blades - you see their distinctive longswords. Now they kneel, their ancient mission fulfilled, as the Last Dragonborn contends with Alduin at the end of time. Are you paying attention, Delphine? You might learn something of our own history. I know the prophecy by heart. Once all Blades knew it.\"\n'When misrule takes its place at the eight corners of the world'\n'When the Brass Tower walks and Time is reshaped'\n'When the thrice-blessed fail and the Red Tower trembles'\n'When the Dragonborn Ruler loses his throne, and the White Tower falls'\n'When the Snow Tower lies sundered, kingless, bleeding'\n'The World-Eater wakes, and the Wheel turns upon the Last Dragonborn.'\nDelphine: \"Well, I'm going to look around some more.

Depending on their class, the Champion may start with a weapon they are able to use, if not already planning to use &lt;a href=\"Magic%20%28Arena%29\"&gt;magic&lt;/a&gt;. Depending on the Champion's &lt;a href=\"Luck%20%28Arena%29\"&gt;Luck&lt;/a&gt; statistic, the loot pile outside of the dungeon may hold better items more suited to their class.\nPrompts appear on-screen in and outside the cell as the Champion moves around. These messages describe the Champion's current surroundings, and are mostly harmless; though there are exceptions far later into \"Arena\". Further abandoning the prison cell, a reminder appears:\n\"The corridors here seem twisted and confusing, but Ria's instructions were to go west, then south to find the Shift Gate...\"\nThe Champion now has two choices:\nIf escape is chosen, the best route to reach the Shift Gate is to, repetitiously, follow Ria's advice: go west, then south from the starting cell.\nIf exploration is preferred, the Champion will satisfy later requirements for starting the second main quest. This provides level experience, &lt;a href=\"Septim%20%28Coin%29\"&gt;gold&lt;/a&gt;, and other loot. Loot is distinguished as a small pile of gold, an opened or closed chest and/or a pile of swords and armors on the floor.\nIt is of note that almost all dungeons in \"Arena\" are extremely disorienting. While few are recognizably handcrafted, as the Imperial Dungeons are, others are randomly generated. It is recommended to use the provided map, fitted with an easy-to-see pink guiding line, and to mark the in-game \"automap.\"\nDuring exploration, non-interactive objects, such as barrels, will be encountered, as well as interactive doors which function as secret passageways. The latter are marked on the automap as walls with passageways behind them, the former must be marked by hand.\nThe foremost hazard currently are sewer waterways which flow between and under the other corridors. Doing a running leap can avoid most water hazards. Swimming costs more fatigue than walking; charged immediately on entry, then shortly thereafter. The Champion cannot use weapons or spells while swimming, and nearby enemies attack and block ledges above the water.\nIt is recommended that the Champion level up during their time in the sewer. This will prompt Ria Silmane's aforementioned contact later on.\nEscape \u2013 Shift Gate.\nEventually, the Champion will come across Silmane's Shift Gate at the end of a thin corridor: a square wall, with blue-beamed edges and a black void in the middle. When approaching, a prompt appears:\n\"Ahead you can see the shimmering field of the Shift Gate...\"\nFloppy Disk Copy Protection.\nOn the floppy disk version of \"Arena\", a window will pop up asking the Champion a question as they approach:\n\"\"A voice booms in your head, 'Look upon the pages marked as The Known Spellbook in your manual and answer...\"\n\"What is the cost of (Item/Spell)?\"\nOn floppy disk releases of \"Arena\", the Champion clears the copy protection by searching their manual for \"The Known Spellbook\" chapter. On all current official, digital releases the costs of the certain magic are found in the game directory: codice_1. If the question is answered incorrectly the first time, it shall prompt once more, and another failure will result in a forceful shutdown.\nIf the Champion has the CD release of the game, this prompt is skipped. The same applies to the Deluxe/Anthology releases of series that include \"Arena\".\nEscape.\nThe Champion will then be teleported into a random city in the province which they selected as their homeland. The Champion must sleep &lt;a href=\"Inns%20%28Arena%29\"&gt;where available&lt;/a&gt; to contact Ria, after progressing from level one. The next quest may then begin, \"&lt;a href=\"Stonekeep%20%28Quest%29\"&gt;Stonekeep&lt;/a&gt;.\""}

The Divines have given me the date when it will happen. It will be the 10th of &lt;a href=\"Sun%27s%20Height\"&gt;Sun's Height&lt;/a&gt;.

I have one such Altmer within my flock. If I cannot persuade him to be a willing sacrifice, we may need to take more desperate measures.

It told me to use the &lt;a href=\"Mallari-Mora\"&gt;Mallari-Mora&lt;/a&gt;. I must secure the innocence of the faithful. The blades of the non-believers will not drink of my flock. Although our mortal lives here will be at an end, the crow has promised our souls will be delivered to Auri-El himself."}

To &lt;a href=\"humans\"&gt;humans&lt;/a&gt;, these et'Ada are the Gods and Demons. To the Aldmer, the &lt;a href=\"Aedra\"&gt;Aedra&lt;/a&gt; (&lt;a href=\"Aldmer\"&gt;Aldmer&lt;/a&gt;i translation is \"our ancestors\") and &lt;a href=\"Daedra\"&gt;Daedra&lt;/a&gt; (Aldmeri translation is \"not our ancestors\"). The Aedra and Daedra came to be once &lt;a href=\"Lorkhan\"&gt;Lorkhan&lt;/a&gt; convinced/tricked the Original Spirits (et'Ada) to create &lt;a href=\"Mundus\"&gt;Mundus&lt;/a&gt;. The Daedra are the et'Ada who did not take part in the creation of Mundus to retain their power. The Aedra are the et'Ada who remained during the creation of Mundus, thus giving away a significant amount of their power.\nOrigins.\nThe origins of the et'Ada are subject of many, often conflicting, creation myths. But in most cases, there are many similarities. It is also important to take note that history in itself is mostly written on the grounds of pious opinions. Whereas one may define their past as heroic and divine, another may portray a much darker, sinister image.\nMost myths start with one force; &lt;a href=\"Anu\"&gt;Anu&lt;/a&gt;. Out of it, or out of the nothing came another force; &lt;a href=\"Padomay\"&gt;Padomay&lt;/a&gt;/&lt;a href=\"Sithis\"&gt;Sithis&lt;/a&gt;. Some myths start with both and call them twins. Their interplay created the &lt;a href=\"Aurbis\"&gt;Aurbis&lt;/a&gt; and many other spirits, the Original Spirits. Some sources suggest that the Aurbis is the deity that enabled the et'Ada to form. The Original Spirits had no identity and it was hard for them to create one. Then came &lt;a href=\"Akatosh\"&gt;Akatosh&lt;/a&gt;/&lt;a href=\"Auri-El\"&gt;Auri-El&lt;/a&gt;, and with him came time. With time, the Original Spirits began to understand their natures and limitations.\nOne of the Original Spirits was &lt;a href=\"Shezarr\"&gt;Shezarr&lt;/a&gt;/&lt;a href=\"Lorkhan\"&gt;Lorkhan&lt;/a&gt;. He either tricked or convinced other spirits to help him create a new plane of existence; &lt;a href=\"Mundus\"&gt;Mundus&lt;/a&gt;. Those spirits lost their youth and strength, and became the Aedra.\nTheories.\nAccording to the book \"&lt;a href=\"Sithis%20%28Book%29\"&gt;Sithis&lt;/a&gt;\", Anu is not a deity of any kind, but is rather a static force without consciousness, personality, intent or will, being immutable static light. Something cannot be created without changing the creator, and Anu is static, and does not change.\nIt is Sithis, according to this book, that created all things. Sithis sundered the Eternal Anu to create new ideas. Unfortunately, some of these ideas became manifest and desired to be as eternal as Anu.\nThis created &lt;a href=\"Aetherius\"&gt;Aetherius&lt;/a&gt; and the Aedra. Sithis then created Lorkhan to destroy these false creations."}

The Eternal Champion helped rescue &lt;a href=\"Emperor\"&gt;Emperor&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Uriel%20Septim%20VII\"&gt;Uriel Septim VII&lt;/a&gt; after he was trapped in a seperate dimension by the &lt;a href=\"Imperial%20Battlemage\"&gt;Imperial Battlemage&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Jagar%20Tharn\"&gt;Jagar Tharn&lt;/a&gt;, during a 10 year event deemed the &lt;a href=\"Imperial%20Simulacrum\"&gt;Imperial Simulacrum&lt;/a&gt;.\nIn &lt;a href=\"3E%20389\"&gt;3E 389&lt;/a&gt;, Jagar Tharn summoned both Uriel Septim VII and General &lt;a href=\"Talin%20Warhaft\"&gt;Talin Warhaft&lt;/a&gt; on rumors of treachery. Tharn betrayed the two, and trapped them in an alternate dimension using the &lt;a href=\"Staff%20of%20Chaos\"&gt;Staff of Chaos&lt;/a&gt;. Tharn's apprentice, &lt;a href=\"Ria%20Silmane\"&gt;Ria Silmane&lt;/a&gt;, witnessed this and tried to warn the &lt;a href=\"Elder%20Council\"&gt;Elder Council&lt;/a&gt;, but was killed by Tharn. After months of planning, Jagar Tharn magically transformed himself into the image of the Emperor, and took the throne. He summoned &lt;a href=\"Lesser%20Daedra\"&gt;demon minions&lt;/a&gt;, transformed them into the &lt;a href=\"Emperor%27s%20Guard\"&gt;Emperor's Guard&lt;/a&gt;, and sent a low-ranking member of the Emperor's court into the &lt;a href=\"Imperial%20Dungeons\"&gt;Imperial Dungeons&lt;/a&gt; to die.\nRia Silmane became an incorporeal being through the use of magic, and remained so that she could warn the Champion of Tharn's treachery. Ria created a key for the prisoner so they can escape the dungeons, and learn how to survive on their own. The only way to stop Tharn was to obtain the Staff of Chaos, which Tharn subsequently shattered into eight pieces and spread them between &lt;a href=\"Tamriel\"&gt;Tamriel&lt;/a&gt;'s most infamous and dangerous locations. Being the only one that she could trust, the Champion began to reassemble the pieces of the legendary staff.\n&lt;a href=\"3E%20399\"&gt;Ten years&lt;/a&gt; later, after a long quest to reassemble the pieces, the Champion finally reassembled the Staff of Chaos. However, Tharn was not defeated as they and Silmane had hoped. Tharn drained the Staff of its power, and had it combined with the essence of his own lifeforce in an artifact named the &lt;a href=\"Jewel%20of%20Fire\"&gt;Jewel of Fire&lt;/a&gt;. The result was Tharn becoming practically invincible as a &lt;a href=\"lich\"&gt;lich&lt;/a&gt;. Fighting their way through the Imperial Palace until they reached the basement level, the Champion fought Tharn in a battle consisting of \"cataclysmic forces.\" After reuniting the magical energies with the Staff, which not only disintegrated Tharn into ash, the Staff created a portal to the dimension where the Emperor and General Warhaft were being held. The Emperor then declares the protagonist the Eternal Champion as a reward for saving the two.\nFate.\nThe Eternal Champion's fate is left unknown at the end of \"Arena\". Uriel Septim claims that the hero will rule by his side, so the Eternal Champion may have been given some form of power over the Empire after the events of the game, though this character remains unmentioned furthermore."}

Torval is the home of the &lt;a href=\"Mane\"&gt;Mane&lt;/a&gt;, the spiritual leader of the Khajiit that is born when the moons, &lt;a href=\"Masser\"&gt;Masser&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Secunda\"&gt;Secunda&lt;/a&gt; are aligned into a unique eclipse.\nDescription.\nGeography.\nThe city-state of Torval is situated on the western end of the &lt;a href=\"Tenmar%20Forest\"&gt;Tenmar Forest&lt;/a&gt;, near the border towards &lt;a href=\"Valenwood\"&gt;Valenwood&lt;/a&gt; and the region of &lt;a href=\"Grahtwood\"&gt;Grahtwood&lt;/a&gt;. It is roughly a hundred yards from the border. Torval in itself is situated in the southern region of &lt;a href=\"Pellitine\"&gt;Pellitine&lt;/a&gt;, which is filled with jungles and river basins, fertile for the growth of &lt;a href=\"Saltrice\"&gt;Saltrice&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Moon%20Sugar\"&gt;Moon Sugar&lt;/a&gt;. The seat of power in Torval is the &lt;a href=\"Palace%20of%20the%20Mane\"&gt;Palace of the Mane&lt;/a&gt;, where the Mane resides. The tribe of the Mane lives in various palaces, surrounded in gardens of sugarcane, where the Mane meditates on a palanquin, held together by their &lt;a href=\"Cathay-raht\"&gt;Cathay-raht&lt;/a&gt; servants. Many people are not welcome into the gardens, in fear of disturbing the Mane. Torval is situated on the edge of the &lt;a href=\"Quin%27rawl%20Peninsula\"&gt;Quin'rawl Peninsula&lt;/a&gt; before it reaches the mainland.\nHistory.\n&lt;a href=\"First%20Era\"&gt;First Era&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe realms of Ancient Elsweyr &amp; the region of Pa'alatiin.\nDuring the early first era, the province that would become Elsweyr was divided into sixteen separate sovereignties, which lived together in peace, unlike the war-torn kingdoms seen in human and elven lands. They would trade and commerce with each other. Torval was one of the original nations. Torval would trade with the Khajiits of &lt;a href=\"Ne%20Quin-al\"&gt;Ne Quin-al&lt;/a&gt; for their warriors of &lt;a href=\"Two-Moons%20Dance\"&gt;Two-Moons Dance&lt;/a&gt;, in exchange for the settlement's prime fish, among other bounties of the Southern Sea. The twin moons, &lt;a href=\"Masser\"&gt;Masser&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Secunda\"&gt;Secunda&lt;/a&gt; had influenced the Khajiiti people, even beyond their kin, each of the realms were given dominance through the land depending on their phases. Torval was given power when the moons are each at Quadrature, each at half moons. As time went on, the &lt;a href=\"Thrassian%20Plague\"&gt;Thrassian Plague&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"1E%202260\"&gt;1E 2260&lt;/a&gt; had arrived on the grasslands of Elsweyr, shifting the tides of power forever. Out of the plague came two distinct kingdoms, Torval, like the rest of Tenmar was absorbed into the region of &lt;a href=\"Pa%27alatiin\"&gt;Pa'alatiin&lt;/a&gt;.\n&lt;a href=\"Second%20Era\"&gt;Second Era&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe Mane of Torval &amp; the 1st Aldmeri Dominion.\nDuring the &lt;a href=\"Interregnum\"&gt;Interregnum&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"2E%20582\"&gt;2E 582&lt;/a&gt;, the Mane of Torval was &lt;a href=\"Akkhuz-ri\"&gt;Akkhuz-ri&lt;/a&gt;, who was well-loved by the people of Elsweyr. While the Mane served as the face of the people, &lt;a href=\"Lord%20Gharesh-ri\"&gt;Lord Gharesh-ri&lt;/a&gt;, the Lord of Torval, served as the province's political leader. At around this time, an anomaly in Khajiiti culture had occurred. For the first time, twin &lt;a href=\"Lunar%20Champions\"&gt;Lunar Champions&lt;/a&gt; was born, both working and training to become the Mane of Elsweyr. The twins, &lt;a href=\"Khali\"&gt;Khali&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Shazah\"&gt;Shazah&lt;/a&gt; worked alongside Akkhuz-ri, as part of their training. In &lt;a href=\"2E%20580\"&gt;2E 580&lt;/a&gt;, Lord Gharesh-ri had signed the &lt;a href=\"Elden%20Accord\"&gt;Elden Accord&lt;/a&gt;, which had created the &lt;a href=\"First%20Aldmeri%20Dominion\"&gt;First Aldmeri Dominion&lt;/a&gt;. Elsweyr were members of the Dominion. However, when the &lt;a href=\"Legion%20of%20the%20West%20Weald\"&gt;Legion of the West Weald&lt;/a&gt; invaded &lt;a href=\"Reaper%27s%20March\"&gt;Reaper's March&lt;/a&gt;, Akkhuz-ri was influenced by the magic of the &lt;a href=\"Dro-m%27Athra\"&gt;Dro-m'Athra&lt;/a&gt;, fleeing the city-state of &lt;a href=\"Silvenar%20%28City%29\"&gt;Silvenar&lt;/a&gt; and partaking in the conquest over Reaper's March. After the events of &lt;a href=\"Arenthia\"&gt;Arenthia&lt;/a&gt;, Akkhuz-ri was stripped of his position, and the Lunar Champions went through the process of not only becoming Mane but sealing the &lt;a href=\"Dark%20Mane\"&gt;Dark Mane&lt;/a&gt; away in the ruins of &lt;a href=\"Moonmont\"&gt;Moonmont&lt;/a&gt;. Eventually, one of the sisters was chosen to be Mane, while the other was made into the Dark Mane, and sealed away. After traversing the &lt;a href=\"Two%20Moons%20Path\"&gt;Two Moons Path&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Dune\"&gt;Dune&lt;/a&gt;, the sister was named Mane of Elsweyr and ruled out of Torval ever since, under the guidance of Gharesh-ri.\n&lt;a href=\"Third%20Era\"&gt;Third Era&lt;/a&gt;.\nTorval during the Imperial Simulacrum.\nDuring the &lt;a href=\"Imperial%20Simulacrum\"&gt;Imperial Simulacrum&lt;/a&gt; from &lt;a href=\"3E%20389\"&gt;3E 389&lt;/a&gt; to &lt;a href=\"3E%20399\"&gt;3E 399&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Emperor\"&gt;Emperor&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Uriel%20Septim%20VII\"&gt;Uriel Septim VII&lt;/a&gt; was imprisoned along with &lt;a href=\"Talin%20Warhaft\"&gt;Talin Warhaft&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;a href=\"Deadlands\"&gt;Deadlands&lt;/a&gt; by &lt;a href=\"Jagar%20Tharn\"&gt;Jagar Tharn&lt;/a&gt;. Tharn planned for months to capture the throne, and he was able to achieve so in the span of ten years. Tharn had a powerful weapon called the &lt;a href=\"Staff%20of%20Chaos\"&gt;Staff of Chaos&lt;/a&gt;, and he split it into nine pieces and scattered them across Tamriel, the staff was the only thing keeping Uriel Septim and Warhaft in &lt;a href=\"Oblivion\"&gt;Oblivion&lt;/a&gt;. A warrior escaped his clutches and traveled all corners of Tamriel to retrieve the missing pieces. The hero was known as the &lt;a href=\"Eternal%20Champion\"&gt;Eternal Champion&lt;/a&gt;, and he assembled the staff and defeated Jagar Tharn at the &lt;a href=\"Imperial%20Palace\"&gt;Imperial Palace&lt;/a&gt;. The Eternal Champion had at one point visited the city of Torval in their quest to recover the pieces. The city of Torval was under the rule of &lt;a href=\"King%20Mostabe\"&gt;King Mostabe&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe Five Year War &amp; the Slaughter of Torval.\nThe Imperial Simulacrum was a decade of war and conflict, where the provinces waged war with each other over domination. The &lt;a href=\"Five%20Year%20War\"&gt;Five Year War&lt;/a&gt; between the Wood Elves and the Khajiit began with an event known as the &lt;a href=\"Slaugther%20of%20Torval\"&gt;Slaugther of Torval&lt;/a&gt; began the war in &lt;a href=\"3E%20395\"&gt;3E 395&lt;/a&gt;. The Bosmer raided the city-state of Torval, killing the people before tribes of the Pellitine jungle intervened and drove them back. Eventually, the conflict grew beyond the southern border, reaching as far as &lt;a href=\"Fort%20Sphinxmoth\"&gt;Fort Sphinxmoth&lt;/a&gt; near &lt;a href=\"Dune\"&gt;Dune&lt;/a&gt;. The largest battle in the war was the &lt;a href=\"Wild%20Hunt\"&gt;Wild Hunt&lt;/a&gt; situated in &lt;a href=\"Vindisi\"&gt;Vindisi&lt;/a&gt;, a township in the Valenwood side of the &lt;a href=\"Xylo%20River\"&gt;Xylo River&lt;/a&gt;. The conflict ended roughly in &lt;a href=\"3E%20399\"&gt;3E 399&lt;/a&gt;, with the Khajiit occupying land east of the Xylo, on the edge of the forest.\nYa'Tirrje, the Gold Cat &amp; the Late Third Era.\nDuring the waning years of the third era, the city-state of &lt;a href=\"Senchal\"&gt;Senchal&lt;/a&gt; had grown exponentially with the rise of &lt;a href=\"Ya%27Tirrje\"&gt;Ya'Tirrje&lt;/a&gt;. Under the reign of the Gold Cat, Senchal underwent a renaissance as Ya'Tirrje used the money from his &lt;a href=\"Skooma\"&gt;Skooma&lt;/a&gt; operation to rebuild the criminal ridden port town. The Gold Cat's Empire had expanded beyond the lower Tenmar, eventually reaching Torval, &lt;a href=\"Corinthe\"&gt;Corinthe&lt;/a&gt;, and even &lt;a href=\"Rimmen\"&gt;Rimmen&lt;/a&gt; in the far north. Ya'Tirrje had utilized the money to keep Senchal crime-free and sanitary, all the while securing the Skooma production in all of Elsweyr. Torval would continue to prosper amidst the realms of the province, all the way into the &lt;a href=\"Fourth%20Era\"&gt;Fourth Era&lt;/a&gt;."}

He doesn't take well to the intensive training, and argues with Farkas about not being allowed to go out and fight. In a conversation between him and &lt;a href=\"Athis\"&gt;Athis&lt;/a&gt;, he states a preference for &lt;a href=\"Warhammers%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;hammers&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Battleaxes%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;axes&lt;/a&gt;.\nAt first glance, he acts friendly towards the Dragonborn.

However, he can be obtained earlier by dropping &lt;a href=\"Armor%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;armor&lt;/a&gt; in front of him while he is walking. He then asks the Dragonborn if he can have the item. If the Dragonborn says \"Consider it yours.\", he becomes available after leaving the area and coming back.\nThe Dragonborn can &lt;a href=\"Marriage%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;marry&lt;/a&gt; Torvar (after Glory of the Dead) if possessing an &lt;a href=\"Amulet%20of%20Mara%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Amulet of Mara&lt;/a&gt; and speaking to him:\n\"\"You're wearing &lt;a href=\"Mara\"&gt;Mara's&lt;/a&gt; amulet? You? I'd marry you. I'd marry you twice.\"\"\nInterested in me, are you? \"I'd be a fool of turning down a chance at marrying you! I'm game if you're game.\"\nIf Torvar should happen to die, the Dragonborn may receive an &lt;a href=\"inheritance\"&gt;inheritance&lt;/a&gt; of around 200 from him via a &lt;a href=\"Courier%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;courier&lt;/a&gt;.\nFollower.\nHis main skills, from highest to lowest:\nTorvar resists arrest along with the Dragonborn if the player gets into trouble in a &lt;a href=\"Hold\"&gt;Hold&lt;/a&gt; and fights the &lt;a href=\"Hold%20Guard\"&gt;Hold Guard&lt;/a&gt;s without question, an uncommon trait amongst the rest of the Companions.\nDialogue.\n\"I haven't seen you before.

Upon Istlod's death, the &lt;a href=\"Moot\"&gt;Moot&lt;/a&gt;\u00a0elected Torygg High King of Skyrim. Torygg was said by some to have a close connection with the &lt;a href=\"Empire\"&gt;Empire&lt;/a&gt;, and praised them frequently, others claim that he sympathized with the &lt;a href=\"Stormcloaks\"&gt;Stormcloaks&lt;/a&gt; and might have seceded from the Empire if &lt;a href=\"Ulfric%20Stormcloak%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Ulfric Stormcloak&lt;/a&gt; had merely asked.\nTorygg was crowned High King after the signing of the &lt;a href=\"White-Gold%20Concordat\"&gt;White-Gold Concordat&lt;/a&gt;, meaning Talos worship in Skyrim was banned to avoid retaliation from the &lt;a href=\"Aldmeri%20Dominion%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Aldmeri Dominion&lt;/a&gt;. High King Torygg would reign over Skyrim until his death at the hands of &lt;a href=\"Ulfric%20Stormcloak%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Ulfric Stormcloak&lt;/a&gt;, in 4E 201. Since he was never publicly vocal regarding the controversy of the White-Gold Concordat, no one knew his true political views and those closest to him described his political leanings as complicated. Even so, many interpreted his silence during the signing of the White-Gold Concordat and its subsequent enforcement as alleged contentment of its policies and resented him for it.\nFate.\nIn &lt;a href=\"4E%20201\"&gt;4E 201&lt;/a&gt;, Torygg was slain by Ulfric Stormcloak, Jarl of &lt;a href=\"Windhelm%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Windhelm&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Eastmarch%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Eastmarch Hold&lt;/a&gt;, in a &lt;a href=\"Traditional%20Nordic%20Duel\"&gt;challenge&lt;/a&gt; over the leadership of Skyrim. Torygg was honor-bound to accept this and agreed to the challenge, but was completely unprepared for Ulfric's Unrelenting Force Shout due to Ulfric having trained in the use of the &lt;a href=\"Thu%27um\"&gt;Thu'um&lt;/a&gt; with &lt;a href=\"The%20Greybeards\"&gt;The Greybeards&lt;/a&gt;. Opinions on what transpired differ greatly, however.\nAccording to Ulfric, he used the power of the &lt;a href=\"Thu%27um\"&gt;Thu'um&lt;/a&gt; to shout Torygg to the ground and then finished him with his sword in front of the entire court. Others, Torygg included, say he was shouted to pieces by Ulfric's Thu'um. Ulfric and his supporters maintain that it was a formal one-on-one duel in the \"Old Nord Way\" and thus should not be considered murder, whereas others in Skyrim believe it was murder.\nMarriage.\nTorygg was married to &lt;a href=\"Elisif%20the%20Fair\"&gt;Elisif the Fair&lt;/a&gt;, who took up the position of Jarl of Solitude after his death. The position of High King is still in dispute and awaits the Moot's decision as Elisif and Ulfric vie for the position due to the &lt;a href=\"Skyrim%20Civil%20War\"&gt;Skyrim Civil War&lt;/a&gt;.\nPolitical views.\nThrough dialogue with his former court members and Elisif, the Dragonborn discovers he respected Ulfric Stormcloak. &lt;a href=\"Sybille%20Stentor\"&gt;Sybille Stentor&lt;/a&gt; even states that Torygg might have stood up against the &lt;a href=\"Empire\"&gt;Empire&lt;/a&gt; if Ulfric had asked him to. Even so, although Torygg respected Ulfric's call for independence during the &lt;a href=\"Moot\"&gt;Moot&lt;/a&gt; to name Torygg High King, it was unlikely he would have led Skyrim to secede from the Empire since he feared Skyrim could not defeat the &lt;a href=\"Third%20Aldmeri%20Dominion\"&gt;Third Aldmeri Dominion&lt;/a&gt; alone and did not want to see the Empire &lt;a href=\"Tiber%20Septim\"&gt;Tiber Septim&lt;/a&gt; built fall apart. After his death, he is still respected by Imperial loyalists. To &lt;a href=\"Stormcloaks\"&gt;Stormcloaks&lt;/a&gt; and proud &lt;a href=\"Talos\"&gt;Talos&lt;/a&gt; worshippers however, Torygg is viewed as a puppet king of the Empire who betrayed them for the Empire's good graces and money. They celebrate Torygg's death in the duel against Ulfric Stormcloak as a symbol of rebellion against what they consider the corruption of the Empire and the &lt;a href=\"Thalmor\"&gt;Thalmor&lt;/a&gt;.\nInteractions.\n&lt;a href=\"Sovngarde%20%28Quest%29\"&gt;Sovngarde&lt;/a&gt;.\nTorygg makes a minor appearance in &lt;a href=\"Sovngarde%20%28Location%29\"&gt;Sovngarde&lt;/a&gt; at the end of the main quest line. Here, the &lt;a href=\"Last%20Dragonborn\"&gt;Dragonborn&lt;/a&gt; can briefly speak to him, where he tells them that he faced Ulfric knowing that he would most certainly die but maintains that his honor at least is unstained. He also speaks of his regret that his wife was left alone and widowed after his death."}

The device itself was required in order to control a great construct, the golem &lt;a href=\"Numidium\"&gt;Numidium&lt;/a&gt;. Due to the immense power of Tiber Septim's golem, many believed that whoever controlled the device controlled the fate of &lt;a href=\"Tamriel\"&gt;Tamriel&lt;/a&gt;.\nIn \"Daggerfall\", the Totem can be given to either Queen &lt;a href=\"Akorithi\"&gt;Akorithi&lt;/a&gt;, King &lt;a href=\"Eadwyre\"&gt;Eadwyre&lt;/a&gt;, King &lt;a href=\"Gothryd\"&gt;Gothryd&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Gortwog%20gro-Nagorm\"&gt;Gortwog gro-Nagorm&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"Mannimarco%20%28Daggerfall%29\"&gt;King of Worms&lt;/a&gt;, Lady &lt;a href=\"Brisienna\"&gt;Brisienna&lt;/a&gt;, or the &lt;a href=\"Underking\"&gt;Underking&lt;/a&gt;, for varying rewards.\nQuests.\n&lt;a href=\"Totem%2C%20Totem%2C%20Who%20Gets%20the%20Totem%3F\"&gt;Totem, Totem, Who Gets the Totem?&lt;/a&gt;.\nAcquire the Totem of Tiber Septim from the Castle Daggerfall Treasury, then decide who to award it to.\nHistory.\nOrigins.\nThe Totem of Tiber Septim was originally created by the &lt;a href=\"Imperial%20Battlemage\"&gt;Imperial Battlemage&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Zurin%20Arctus\"&gt;Zurin Arctus&lt;/a&gt;, under orders of Tiber Septim as a means in which the Numidium could be controlled. In order to ensure that the Totem would never fall into the wrong hands, Zurin put a seal on it so that only a person of the &lt;a href=\"Septim%20Dynasty\"&gt;Septim Bloodline&lt;/a&gt;, or someone with a &lt;a href=\"Shezarrine\"&gt;supernatural existence&lt;/a&gt; like Zurin himself, could wield its power; anyone who attempted to use it without meeting its requirements would die instantly. However, in later years, the witch &lt;a href=\"Nulfaga\"&gt;Nulfaga&lt;/a&gt; would discover a loophole in this seal, that being that a person of royal blood could also utilize the Totem.\nWhen Tiber Septim betrayed Zurin, causing the death of the battlemage, Tiber Septim began using the Numidium to crush the neutral royal families of &lt;a href=\"Tamriel\"&gt;Tamriel&lt;/a&gt; and replace them with more loyal subjects. The &lt;a href=\"Underking\"&gt;Underking&lt;/a&gt; heavily disapproved of this use of Numidium and decided to destroy the Dwemer golem. In the ensuing fight, the Numidium was destroyed and all its pieces were lost, including the its power source, &lt;a href=\"Mantella\"&gt;Mantella&lt;/a&gt;, and the Totem of Tiber Septim. Without the Mantella, The Underking was forced to enter a long hibernation period as he used up all his energy in his fight with Numidium. Since that day, the &lt;a href=\"Blades\"&gt;Blades&lt;/a&gt; endeavored to recover all the pieces of Numidium.\nEvents of Daggerfall.\nBy the year &lt;a href=\"3E%20401\"&gt;3E 401&lt;/a&gt;, the Blades had recovered all the pieces of Numidium, save for one, the Mantella. The Numidium had been reassembled and the Totem was in their hands but without the power source the Numidium was useless. In her astral travels the mother of King &lt;a href=\"Lysandus\"&gt;Lysandus&lt;/a&gt;, Nulfaga, discovered the whereabouts of the Mantella and promised to disclose its location to &lt;a href=\"Uriel%20Septim%20VII\"&gt;Uriel Septim VII&lt;/a&gt; as long as he agreed to never use the Numidium to attack &lt;a href=\"Daggerfall%20%28Region%29\"&gt;Lysandus' Kingdom&lt;/a&gt;. However, Uriel disagrees with Nulfaga's request.\nAt some point, the Blades inexplicably lost possession of the Totem of Tiber Septim and had no choice but to search for the device again. The Blades would later discover that by unknown means, Lord &lt;a href=\"Woodborne\"&gt;Woodborne&lt;/a&gt; gained possession of the Totem. In order to retrieve it, the Blades sacked Woodborne Hall but to the astonishment of the Blades, the Totem was nowhere to be found. An undercover Blades agent known as Lady &lt;a href=\"Brisienna\"&gt;Brisienna&lt;/a&gt; had reason to believe that &lt;a href=\"Gothryd\"&gt;Gothryd&lt;/a&gt;, the then current king of Daggerfall, had stolen the device. Brisienna sent the &lt;a href=\"Hero%20of%20Daggerfall\"&gt;Agent of Daggerfall&lt;/a&gt; to recover the artifact which was located within the Daggerfall treasury.\nAfter the Agent acquired the Totem, multiple individuals seeking the device sent him letters promising great rewards in return for gifting them the Totem. While the Agent did choose to give the Totem to one of its seekers, the subsequent activation of the Numidium created a &lt;a href=\"Dragon%20Break\"&gt;Dragon Break&lt;/a&gt; in which several timelines were created each centering around the goals of the Totem's claimants; these timelines were then reconciled in such a way as to cause each potential claimant to gain at least some of what they wanted. For example, the major rulers who each wanted the entirety of the Iliac Bay each received large tracts of the surrounding lands rather than any of them receiving all of it. This event was known as the &lt;a href=\"Warp%20in%20the%20West\"&gt;Warp in the West&lt;/a&gt;.\nRetrieving the totem.\nUpon retrieving the totem, the following message plays:\n\"A voice in your head intones...\"\n\"You are . You are my new host. Know this now and resolutely. You are not worthy to carry the Totem of Tiber Septim. Only those of his blood line may carry me. I will give you a year and a day to accomplish this.\""}

According to this text, it was an incredibly difficult journey. The &lt;a href=\"Last%20Dragonborn\"&gt;Dragonborn&lt;/a&gt; must take this journey to obtain &lt;a href=\"Auriel%27s%20Bow%20%28Dawnguard%29\"&gt;Auriel's Bow&lt;/a&gt; during the quest \"&lt;a href=\"Touching%20the%20Sky%20%28Quest%29\"&gt;Touching the Sky&lt;/a&gt;\" in .\nContents.\nMany of the most dedicated &lt;a href=\"Snow%20Elves\"&gt;Snow Elves&lt;/a&gt; once committed themselves to a tireless journey through the &lt;a href=\"Chantry%20of%20Auri-El\"&gt;Chantry&lt;/a&gt; to the &lt;a href=\"Inner%20Sanctum\"&gt;Inner Sanctum&lt;/a&gt;. They carried with them the paramount desire to become one with their god, &lt;a href=\"Auri-El\"&gt;Auri-El&lt;/a&gt;. Though all set out with the determination to prove their worth, few were prepared for the trials that lay ahead. For the path to Auri-El was not without its tribulations. The &lt;a href=\"Pilgrim\"&gt;Pilgrim&lt;/a&gt;s struggled not only against the natural elements of the treacherous vale, but with a myriad of tests upon their faith and loyalty.\nIt is told that many simply could not continue on the path for long before turning back. Some argue that the rebuke they endured upon their return was crueler than any punishment that may have lay ahead of them along the path. In their failed attempt, they were forced to live in the shadow of those who did continue on to achieve the great glory and honor of ascension into the light. Forever after their faith and loyalty in Auri-El would be scrutinized and their remaining days filled with shame and regret.\nTales of those who reached the Inner Sanctum are not without their share of woes. It is said upon their arrival that many were mere shells of the person they had once been. Some were quite mad from sleeplessness and starved to the point of frailty. By the end of their journey, the marvel they had strength yet to carry their vessel and ascend the stairs of the temple was the last true testament of their loyalty. Regardless of each individual's tale, the final words remain eerily similar. It is said that every pilgrim ascended, bathed in light, a look of relief and contentment on their face."}

I should proceed there as soon as I'm prepared if I wish to recover the bow and stop Harkon from completing the Tyranny of the Sun.\"\nThe name of the quest is a reference to an &lt;a href=\"ancient%20Falmer%20tome\"&gt;ancient Falmer tome&lt;/a&gt; of the &lt;a href=\"Touching%20the%20Sky%20%28Book%29\"&gt;same name&lt;/a&gt;. The book itself depicts an ancient ritual carried out by initiates of the &lt;a href=\"Chantry%20of%20Auri-El\"&gt;Chantry of Auri-El&lt;/a&gt;. It describes the trials and struggles that they had to endure in order to secure an audience with the Arch Curate and reach enlightenment. Subsequently, this incredibly difficult journey must be taken by the &lt;a href=\"Last%20Dragonborn\"&gt;Dragonborn&lt;/a&gt; and is a major aspect of the quest.\nWalkthrough.\nIf one has a second follower in addition to Serana (possible if the second follower was acquired at a particular point during \"&lt;a href=\"Chasing%20Echoes\"&gt;Chasing Echoes&lt;/a&gt;\"), it is recommended that the second follower be dismissed before entering Darkfall Cave, otherwise they may get permanently stuck somewhere in Darkfall Cave. The second follower can be re-recruited just after killing the boss at the end of this quest, and the second follower slot should then persist for the entire game.\nDarkfall Cave.\nEnter &lt;a href=\"Darkfall%20Cave\"&gt;Darkfall Cave&lt;/a&gt; and follow the winding path past the waterfall. Kill the &lt;a href=\"Frostbite%20Spider%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;frostbite spider&lt;/a&gt; that is lurking in the shadows and then take the right-hand path at the junction. Continue down until an old wooden bridge is encountered. On the far side of the bridge are two &lt;a href=\"Moonstone%20Ore%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;moonstone ore&lt;/a&gt; veins and a pickaxe on a table. Attempting to walk back across the bridge will cause it to collapse, and the Dragonborn will fall into the rapids below.\nThe rapids will sweep the Dragonborn down a long tunnel and past a few frostbite spiders, awakening them. A short drop down a waterfall will deposit the Dragonborn into a large spider nest, with three spiders in tow. After killing the spiders, follow the river and defeat four more spider who will awaken. A giant frostbite spider will also emerge from a tunnel in the wall which also contains a &lt;a href=\"Containers%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;chest&lt;/a&gt;. Follow the path and proceed up the dark tunnel until an abandoned camp at a junction point is found.\nNearby, a Breton woman lies dead and is carrying a \"&lt;a href=\"Darkfall%20Cave%20Note\"&gt;Darkfall Cave Note&lt;/a&gt;\" explaining the massacre. There are two ways to proceed: the first method is a shortcut that is accessed by pulling a chain behind the bed shelter in the camp, which opens a nearby stone wall door; the second method is the long winding path to the east of the camp that leads downhill, past a boulder tripwire &lt;a href=\"Traps%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;trap&lt;/a&gt;, and into a large cavern that is host to two &lt;a href=\"Troll%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;trolls&lt;/a&gt;. Either method will lead to a mysterious person praying at an altar.\nAuriel's Shrine.\nThe person is &lt;a href=\"Knight-Paladin%20Gelebor\"&gt;Knight-Paladin Gelebor&lt;/a&gt;, one of the last living &lt;a href=\"Snow%20Elves\"&gt;Snow Elves&lt;/a&gt;. When approached, he will introduce himself and welcome the Dragonborn to the &lt;a href=\"Chantry%20of%20Auri-El\"&gt;Chantry of Auri-El&lt;/a&gt;. He will give a little background about himself and his race and then the topic will turn to Auriel's Bow. He will mention that he knows that that is why the Dragonborn is here, and he is willing to help, but in order to acquire the bow, the Dragonborn must assist him and kill his brother, &lt;a href=\"Arch-Curate%20Vyrthur\"&gt;Arch-Curate Vyrthur&lt;/a&gt;.\nWhen questioned about his brother, he will recount the story of when the chantry was attacked by a horde of &lt;a href=\"Falmer%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Falmer&lt;/a&gt;, which are referred as \"The Betrayed\" by him. Gelebor believes that Vyrthur was corrupted by the falmer, as after the attack his change in behavior was significant. He mentions that Vyrthur never looks as though he is in pain or under duress. He just stands in one place and watches, as though waiting.\nAfter inquiring about how to reach his brother, Gelebor casts a spell on the large dome-like structure, called a &lt;a href=\"Wayshrines%20%28Dawnguard%29\"&gt;wayshrine&lt;/a&gt;, which raises to reveal an arched opening. He gives the Dragonborn an &lt;a href=\"initiate%27s%20ewer\"&gt;initiate's ewer&lt;/a&gt; and explains that to reach the &lt;a href=\"Inner%20Sanctum\"&gt;Inner Sanctum&lt;/a&gt;, one must follow the path of an initiate of the Chantry of Auri-El, as described in the book \"&lt;a href=\"Touching%20the%20Sky%20%28Book%29\"&gt;Touching the Sky&lt;/a&gt;\". This involves passing through five wayshrines that will eventually lead to the Inner Sanctum where his brother and Auriel's Bow are located. Serana, curious about the process, will begin a conversation with Gelebor:\nSerana: \"What's that basin in the center signify?\"\nGelebor: \"Once the Initiate completed his mantras, he'd dip a ceremonial ewer in the basin at the wayshrine's center and proceed to the next wayshrine.\"\nSerana: \"So these Initiates had to lug around a heavy pitcher of water. Marvelous. How long would they have to do that?\"\nGelebor: \"Well, once the Initiate's enlightenment was complete, he'd bring the ewer to the Chantry's Inner Sanctum. Pouring the contents of the ewer into the sacred basin of the Sanctum would allow him to enter for an audience with the Arch-Curate himself.\"\nSerana: \"All that just to end up dumping it out? Makes no sense to me.\"\nGelebor: \"It's symbolic. I don't expect you to understand.\"\nSerana: \"So let's get this straight. We need to do all that nonsense to get into the temple, so we can kill your brother and claim Auriel's Bow?\"\nGelebor: \"I know how it all sounds, but if there was another way I'd have done it long ago. The only way to get to my brother is by following in the Initiates' footsteps and traveling from wayshrine to wayshrine just as they did. The first lay at the end of Darkfall Passage, a cavern that represents the absence of enlightenment.\"\nOnce the conversation has ended, proceed inside the wayshrine and into the portal to Darkfall Passage.\nDarkfall Passage.\nFollow the corridor past the water where a falmer and &lt;a href=\"Chaurus%20Hunter%20%28Dawnguard%29\"&gt;chaurus hunter&lt;/a&gt; will attack. Farther down, the tunnel opens up into where there are additional falmer and &lt;a href=\"Chaurus%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;chaurus&lt;/a&gt;. Near the east wall is a small puddle that leads deep down into a secret tunnel where a skeleton lies by some &lt;a href=\"gleamblossom\"&gt;gleamblossom&lt;/a&gt;, leveled loot and \"&lt;a href=\"Darkfall%20Passage%20Note%20I\"&gt;Darkfall Passage Note I&lt;/a&gt;\". Head west into another tunnel, past a falmer claw trap and a chest.\nThe path leads to a small falmer camp where several will attack, alongside a few chaurus hunters. Drop down into the crevice the waterfall disperses into, where two skeletons will be found. Follow the path up and around a bend to find another skeleton and a leveled treasure chest. From there, simply follow the path up farther to find a pull chain that opens the way back into the falmer camp area. Follow the path behind the waterfall to come to another camp with several falmer. Head up the walkway, past the curious sculpture and through the room with the large crystal. Following yet another tunnel will lead to a large cavern with another waterfall. Two regular falmer and a boss level falmer are present here. A small hut near the walkway contains a boss level chest.\nProceed up the walkway through the waterfall. To the right is a room with several traps, a chest and an alchemy lab and some potions. To the left is boulder trap within a long tunnel that contains a skeleton with a note called \"&lt;a href=\"Darkfall%20Passage%20Note%20II\"&gt;Darkfall Passage Note II&lt;/a&gt;\" that warns of several traps. Two rope releases will be fixed to the wall by the skeleton. The left one will open the stone door and the right will activate the trap. A &lt;a href=\"vale%20sabre%20cat\"&gt;vale sabre cat&lt;/a&gt; will be seated just as the door opens. After killing it, proceeding through the passage will lead to an enormous cavern, with many giant glowing mushrooms as seen in &lt;a href=\"Blackreach%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Blackreach&lt;/a&gt;. Progress down the cavern past the waterfall and up a stone path until the &lt;a href=\"Wayshrine%20of%20Illumination\"&gt;Wayshrine of Illumination&lt;/a&gt; is reached on the western wall where the spirit of &lt;a href=\"Prelate%20Sidanyis\"&gt;Prelate Sidanyis&lt;/a&gt; is waiting. Like Gelebor, he will cast a spell on the wayshrine and it raises to reveal a door. Proceed inside and draw water from the basin, then head into the portal to Forgotten Vale.\nForgotten Vale.\nTraverse through the initial tunnel until it leads to an opening. Walking up the spiral path will lead outdoors into the Forgotten Vale. The goal in this area is to fill the initiate's ewer from the remaining four wayshrines dotted around the valley. Head down to the floor of the valley fighting off any vale sabre cats, and past some ancient ruins. Keep heading north-west and follow the decrepit path. Just before the second arch, take a right north-east through the trees to reach the &lt;a href=\"Wayshrine%20of%20Sight\"&gt;Wayshrine of Sight&lt;/a&gt; where the spirit of &lt;a href=\"Prelate%20Athring\"&gt;Prelate Athring&lt;/a&gt; will be waiting. As before, speak to the Prelate to raise the wayshrine and collect the ewer.\nHead back along the ruined path and south-west up the hill that leads to a ravine guarded by four frostbite spiders of varying size. Keep heading downhill along the path. A skeleton, \"&lt;a href=\"Unknown%20Book%2C%20Vol.%20I\"&gt;Unknown Book, Vol. I&lt;/a&gt;\" and a chest can be found on the right side of the path before the partially frozen river is reached. At the river, head south along the bank until the &lt;a href=\"Wayshrine%20of%20Learning\"&gt;Wayshrine of Learning&lt;/a&gt; is reached. Speak to the spirit of &lt;a href=\"Prelate%20Celegriath\"&gt;Prelate Celegriath&lt;/a&gt; and collect the ewer. Now head back along the river bank and keep traveling north-west until a steep stepped path is visible to the north. A &lt;a href=\"Frost%20Giant%20%28Dawnguard%29\"&gt;frost giant&lt;/a&gt; holding an &lt;a href=\"amethyst%20paragon\"&gt;amethyst paragon&lt;/a&gt; will also be standing by the river to the right. Climb the stepped northern path to the top. The next wayshrine should be visible across the river to the west. Continue along the mountain path and across the natural rock bridge over the river to reach the &lt;a href=\"Wayshrine%20of%20Resolution\"&gt;Wayshrine of Resolution&lt;/a&gt; where the spirit of &lt;a href=\"Prelate%20Nirilor\"&gt;Prelate Nirilor&lt;/a&gt; will be waiting. As before, speak to the Prelate to raise the wayshrine and collect the ewer.\nA word of power for &lt;a href=\"Drain%20Vitality%20%28Dawnguard%29\"&gt;Drain Vitality&lt;/a&gt; can also be learned just to the south of the Wayshrine of Resolution, in the middle of the large frozen lake. The word wall is typically guarded by two dragons, &lt;a href=\"Naaslaarum\"&gt;Naaslaarum&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Voslaarum\"&gt;Voslaarum&lt;/a&gt;; however, if the quest \"&lt;a href=\"Dragon%20Rising\"&gt;Dragon Rising&lt;/a&gt;\" has not been completed, the word wall is guarded by two &lt;a href=\"Ice%20Wraith%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;ice wraiths&lt;/a&gt;. Moreover, a frost giant which holds the &lt;a href=\"sapphire%20paragon\"&gt;sapphire paragon&lt;/a&gt; can be found east of the Wayshrine of Resolution. Along with this, across the river from this giant lies the &lt;a href=\"Paragon%20Platform\"&gt;Paragon Platform&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe final wayshrine is located some distance away. Go back up the hill to the Wayshrine of Resolution. Head back over the rock bridge and continue west downhill into a falmer camp by the river. A large falmer village teeming with falmer exists in the mountains above the river, but it can be bypassed by traveling upstream and defeating a few chaurus hunters passing the entrance to &lt;a href=\"Sharpslope%20Cave\"&gt;Sharpslope Cave&lt;/a&gt;. Though the village mainly contains standard falmer loot, there are a few items of note. The village has a small enclave that houses the frost giant that hold the &lt;a href=\"emerald%20paragon\"&gt;emerald paragon&lt;/a&gt;. In a hidden passage in Sharpslope Cave is a &lt;a href=\"shellbug\"&gt;shellbug&lt;/a&gt;, and in one of the village huts is the \"&lt;a href=\"Unknown%20Book%2C%20Vol.%20III\"&gt;Unknown Book, Vol. III&lt;/a&gt;\". To get it, head north from the entrance to the &lt;a href=\"Glacial%20Crevice\"&gt;Glacial Crevice&lt;/a&gt;, up the rock bridge that leads to the left. Turn slightly right and cross another rock bridge, then turn sharply left and cross the falmer bridge leading west-southwest. Turn right and cross one more rock bridge to the hut that holds the book.\nHead up the path, past the waterfall and under the stone arch to reach another camp by a vast glacial wall. After killing the guarding falmer, walk into the glacial crevice.\nGlacial Crevice.\nFollowing the ice tunnel leads to an enormous frozen ravine inhabited by more falmer. Travel up the ice walkway, killing any falmer who attack. At the top is another tunnel that leads deeper into the ravine. Dodge past the falmer claw trap and walk along the perilous icy edge of the cliff. Head along the path, past the various falmer and chaurus, and into another tunnel. Keep heading east and the tunnel will open up into a smaller ravine. Climb up the spiral path and through another tunnel to lead up to a higher pathway of the ravine. Head along another perilous path and defeat the guarding falmer. Cross the rope bridge and head north-east past the ancient pillars that leads back out to the Forgotten Vale.\nWayshrine of Radiance.\nThe cave exits into another falmer camp entrenched in a ravine. The optional &lt;a href=\"diamond%20paragon\"&gt;diamond paragon&lt;/a&gt; can be obtained from a frost giant by immediately turning left and following the path uphill that leads to him.\nThen head east up the walkways defeating the plethora of falmer. Keep heading east to reach a hut with a mammoth skull over it. Inside is the \"&lt;a href=\"Unknown%20Book%2C%20Vol.%20IV\"&gt;Unknown Book, Vol. IV&lt;/a&gt;\" and a boss chest. Head back out and drop down to the floor of the ravine and keep heading south into a tunnel. Traverse through the tunnel past the boulder trap and up through to the &lt;a href=\"Wayshrine%20of%20Radiance\"&gt;Wayshrine of Radiance&lt;/a&gt;, tended by the spirit of &lt;a href=\"Prelate%20Edhelbor\"&gt;Prelate Edhelbor&lt;/a&gt;. Speak to the Prelate to raise the wayshrine and collect the final ewer. Once this has been completed, turn and head northeast toward the inner sanctum.\nInner Sanctum.\nWalk across the ornate bridge and up the stairs into the courtyard of the inner sanctum where a statue of &lt;a href=\"Auri-El\"&gt;Auri-El&lt;/a&gt; stands tall, ready to greet visitors. Head up the steps and pour the ewer into the basin. The ewer will flow towards the main door and unlock the seal.\nOnce inside, proceed forward to see several falmer frozen like statues around the main lobby. Several are gathered around a &lt;a href=\"Shrine%20of%20Auriel\"&gt;Shrine of Auriel&lt;/a&gt; and a few hold leveled loot in their hands. However, taking the loot causes some of the frozen falmer and their chaurus to break free and attack. Defeating them causes their frozen bodies to shatter into pieces.\nOn the western wall is an altar that, when activated by placing the ewer atop, opens a hidden door. This path leads to a room that houses a frost giant who holds a &lt;a href=\"ruby%20paragon\"&gt;ruby paragon&lt;/a&gt;. Another hidden room near the frost giant can be accessed in the same way if the ewer is removed from the altar and taken inside before the door seals itself.\nHead back into the lobby and proceed north through the ruined temple past more frozen falmer. The path will lead through a glacial tunnel that leads to Auriel's chapel.\nAuriel's Chapel.\nHead forward and drop down. Once this happens, there is no turning back at this point. Proceed through the collapsed hallway that opens up into a small cavern housing several &lt;a href=\"frozen%20falmer\"&gt;frozen falmer&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Arch-Curate%20Vyrthur\"&gt;Arch-Curate Vyrthur&lt;/a&gt; seated on a throne. After his initial dialogue, the frozen falmer and chaurus will awaken. After defeating the initial wave, large parts of the ceiling will begin to fall and more falmer will attack. Next, Arch-Curate Vyrthur will summon an &lt;a href=\"ancient%20frost%20atronach\"&gt;ancient frost atronach&lt;/a&gt; and more falmer. Once everything has been defeated, Vyrthur will destroy the entire roof of the chapel in a fit of rage and retreat out to a grand balcony overlooking the Forgotten Vale. Pursue him, past the wayshrine and up the stairs. Serana will initiate the following dialogue:\nSerana: \"Enough, Vyrthur. Give us the bow!\"\nArch-Curate Vyrthur \"How dare you. I was the Arch-Curate of Auri-El, girl. I had the ears of a god!\"\"\nSerana: \"\"Until the \"Betrayed\" corrupted you. Yes, yes. We've heard this sad story\"\"\nArch-Curate Vyrthur: \"Gelebor and his kind are easily manipulated fools. Look into my eyes, Serana. You tell me what I am.\"\nSerana: \"You're... you're a vampire? But Auriel should have protected you...\"\nArch-Curate Vyrthur: \"The moment I was infected by one of my own Initiates, Auri-El turned his back on me. I swore I'd have my revenge, no matter what the cost.\"\nSerana: \"You want to take revenge... on a god?\"\nArch-Curate Vyrthur: \"Auri-El himself may have been beyond my reach, but his influence on our world wasn't. All I needed was the blood of a vampire and his own weapon, Auriel's Bow.\"\nSerana: \"The blood of a vampire... Auriel's Bow... It... it was you? You created that prophecy?\"\nArch-Curate Vyrthur: \"A prophecy that lacked a single, final ingredient... the blood of a pure vampire. The blood of a Daughter of Coldharbour.\"\nSerana: \"You were waiting... all this time for someone with my blood to come along. Well, too bad for you... I intend on keeping it. Let's see if your blood has any power to it!\"\nVyrthur: \"What trickery is this?\"\nFinal battle.\nAfter this exchange he will attack. In battle he uses ice magic that Snow Elves were famed for. Spells such as &lt;a href=\"Icy%20Spear\"&gt;Icy Spear&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Frost%20Cloak%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Frost Cloak&lt;/a&gt; in addition to a unique variant of &lt;a href=\"Vampiric%20Drain%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Vampiric Drain&lt;/a&gt;, that also drains stamina, make up the core of his arsenal, alongside &lt;a href=\"Lightning%20Bolt%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Lightning Bolt&lt;/a&gt; to quickly drain his opponent's health and prevent them from using &lt;a href=\"Restoration%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Restoration&lt;/a&gt; spells to recover. He also typically summons a frost atronach at the start of a battle. Once his magicka runs dry he switches to his frost-enchanted &lt;a href=\"Elven%20Dagger%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;elven dagger&lt;/a&gt;.\nOnce he has been defeated, the balcony wayshrine will raise and Gelebor will exit from it. Speaking to him will begin the following conversation:\n\"So, the deed has been done. The restoration of this wayshrine means that Vyrthur must be dead and the Betrayed no longer have control over him.\"\nThe Betrayed weren't to blame: \"What? What are you talking about?\"\nHe was a vampire. He controlled them: \"A vampire? I see. That would explain much. Deep inside, it brings me joy that the Betrayed weren't to blame for what happened here.\"\nWhy?: \"Because that means there's still hope that they might one day shed their hatred and learn to believe in Auri-El once again. It's been a long time since I felt that way and it's been long overdue. My thanks, to both of you.\"\nYou're welcome: \"You risked everything to get Auri-El's Bow, and in turn, you've restored the Chantry. I can't think of a more deserving champion to carry it than you. If you wish to learn more about the bow, or obtain Sunhallowed Arrows for it, I'd be more than happy to help. You've but to ask.\"\nAfter speaking to him retrieve &lt;a href=\"Auriel%27s%20Bow%20%28Dawnguard%29\"&gt;Auriel's Bow&lt;/a&gt; from inside the wayshrine. This will end the quest and immediately begin the final quest: \"&lt;a href=\"Kindred%20Judgment\"&gt;Kindred Judgment&lt;/a&gt;.\""}

Unlike the great mountain, which is a thing of nature, the tower is a structure\u2014but one not constructed by &lt;a href=\"Men\"&gt;Men&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"Mer\"&gt;Mer&lt;/a&gt;, if the legends speak true, but by the &lt;a href=\"Aedra\"&gt;Aedra&lt;/a&gt; themselves.\nIt rises, stark and sheer, from the high center of &lt;a href=\"Balfiera\"&gt;Balfiera Island&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;a href=\"Iliac%20Bay\"&gt;Iliac Bay&lt;/a&gt;, where it has stood since the dawn of time itself. Adamantine Tower, it is called, for the unknown, ageless material from which it is built, and &lt;a href=\"Tower%20Zero\"&gt;Tower Zero&lt;/a&gt;, as the edifice that predates all other buildings on &lt;a href=\"Mundus\"&gt;Mundus&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Direnni\"&gt;Direnni&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Altmer%20%28Online%29\"&gt;High Elves&lt;/a&gt; have ruled Balfiera since the beginning of the &lt;a href=\"First%20Era\"&gt;First Era&lt;/a&gt;. In common parlance the tower bears their name, though they can claim only the construction of the more recent keep that clusters around the tower's base. (Who is responsible for delving the catacombs beneath the keep is a matter of debate with no definitive consensus.)\nI have not consulted with the High Elves of &lt;a href=\"Alinor\"&gt;Alinor&lt;/a&gt; (who has?), but the noble Croiden, Elden Antiquariat of the Direnni, deigned to answer a few questions. According to him, the tower was erected in the &lt;a href=\"Dawn%20Era\"&gt;Dawn Era&lt;/a&gt; when the gods met to decide the fate of Mundus. At its apex, &lt;a href=\"Auri-El\"&gt;Auri-El&lt;/a&gt;, the great god of the &lt;a href=\"Aldmer\"&gt;Aldmer&lt;/a&gt;i, slew the trickster &lt;a href=\"Lorkhan\"&gt;Lorkhan&lt;/a&gt;, impaled his heart on an arrow and launched it across the world. The heart merely laughed and lived on.\nThe Aedra then withdrew from the affairs of Mundus, leaving behind the tower for the Direnni to discover and take for their own. What secrets did they find there? What have they concealed to this day? Whatever the secrets may be, the Direnni didn't reveal them to this humble &lt;a href=\"Nords%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Nord&lt;/a&gt; architect.\nHowever, secrets there must be, for I took sight-and-angle measurements of the Direnni Tower from the eight points of the compass. According to my calculations, and given the known characteristics of all available materials, building an edifice of its proportions should not be possible."}

He reveals that he has a client with particular tastes in literature that can only be sated with the writings of a madman. The trek through Yngvild's caves and tunnels is rather straightforward. The Dragonborn will fight many leveled &lt;a href=\"Draugr%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;draugr&lt;/a&gt;\u00a0and &lt;a href=\"Yngvild%20Ghost\"&gt;Yngvild Ghost&lt;/a&gt;s\u00a0along the way.\nYngvild.\nFollow the tunnel to the first chamber. There will be two draugr\u00a0in the passageway on the far side. At the fork in the tunnel, go left where a Yngvild Ghost\u00a0is standing in front of a table with \"&lt;a href=\"Arondil%27s%20Journal%2C%20Part%201\"&gt;Arondil's Journal, Part 1&lt;/a&gt;\"\u00a0upon it. In the room to the left, there is another Yngvild Ghost\u00a0as well as a draugr\u00a0and a small amount of loot in &lt;a href=\"Burial%20Urn\"&gt;Burial Urn&lt;/a&gt;s.\nReturning to the fork, the rightmost path (the one with ice for walls) leads to a small chamber with a single Yngvild Ghost\u00a0and two dead and half-buried draugr\u00a0which can be easily skipped. Follow the remaining path to another fork where a single draugr is waiting. The lefthand path leads to an Yngvild Ghost\u00a0as well as a\u00a0seeming dead-end which contains the secret door through which the Dragonborn will eventually exit the dungeon. Taking the righthand path, the Dragonborn finds themselves at the top of a tall chamber. Straight ahead is a gap which can be jumped\u00a0and leads to an Adept-locked\u00a0leveled chest. There are two draugr\u00a0down the zig-zagging path to the left. Another chest containing gold and some lockpicks sits at the bottom of the chamber.\nFollowing the tunnel out of the chamber,\u00a0\"&lt;a href=\"Arondil%27s%20Journal%2C%20Part%202\"&gt;Arondil's Journal, Part 2&lt;/a&gt;\"\u00a0can be found on a table in an alcove straight ahead when the path turns right. An\u00a0Yngvild Ghost\u00a0and a draugr wait on the path just beyond the alcove in a small chamber. \"&lt;a href=\"Arondil%27s%20Journal%2C%20Part%203\"&gt;Arondil's Journal, Part 3&lt;/a&gt;\"\u00a0sits on a table in an alcove just beyond that chamber and right before the door to the &lt;a href=\"Yngvild\"&gt;Yngvild Throne Room&lt;/a&gt;.\nYngvild Throne Room.\nInside a\u00a0large cavern,\u00a0Arondil\u00a0sits next to his\u00a0Yngvild Ghost bodyguard. If the Dragonborn has a\u00a0high sneak skill or invisibility, they can steal the &lt;a href=\"Greater%20Soul%20Gem%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Greater Soul Gem&lt;/a&gt; on the pedestal behind Arondil, which triggers\u00a0Arondil's bodyguard\u00a0to go berserk and attack\u00a0Arondil. The bodyguard\u00a0usually kills Arondil unless Arondil has a Staff of Fireball or another similarly powerful weapon. Finish off the victor regardless. Loot Arondil's body for Arondil's Key, some gold, a staff (possibly the one needed for the quest\u00a0\"&lt;a href=\"Arniel%27s%20Endeavor\"&gt;Arniel's Endeavor&lt;/a&gt;\") and &lt;a href=\"Necromancer%20Robes%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;necromancer robes&lt;/a&gt;. The alteration skill book, &lt;a href=\"Reality%20%26amp%3B%20Other%20Falsehoods\"&gt;Reality &amp; Other Falsehoods&lt;/a&gt;, sits next a Greater Soul Gem\u00a0on the table left of the throne. In the bedroom behind the throne, the Dragonborn will find a &lt;a href=\"Stone%20of%20Barenziah\"&gt;Stone of Barenziah&lt;/a&gt;\u00a0sitting on the table by \"&lt;a href=\"Arondil%27s%20Journal%2C%20Part%204\"&gt;Arondil's Journal, Part 4&lt;/a&gt;\".\u00a0A Grand Staff of Charming is leaning against a leveled chest, and one final Yngvild Ghost is sleeping in the &lt;a href=\"Red%20Mountain%20Flower\"&gt;Red Mountain Flower&lt;/a&gt;-covered\u00a0bed.\nTo exit the level,\u00a0head down a\u00a0tunnel to the east, where there is a gate that can be opened by activating the lever on the wall to the right. Through the gate are the bodies of three females, a Nord, a Breton, and a Redguard, none of which have any significant loot. Open the iron door on the right either by picking the Master Lock or with Arondil's Key and head up the spiral staircase to a the door back to Yngvild.\nThere is an apprentice-level locked chest immediately to the right back in Yngvild. Down the passage lies a secret door that\u00a0opens\u00a0by means of\u00a0the lever beside it. Follow the path to the exit. Return to Vekel the Man\u00a0in &lt;a href=\"the%20Ragged%20Flagon\"&gt;the Ragged Flagon&lt;/a&gt; to claim the reward."}

I first heard of the secret battleground in &lt;a href=\"Valenwood%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Valenwood&lt;/a&gt;, when &lt;a href=\"Biiri%20the%20Beautiful\"&gt;Biiri the Beautiful&lt;/a&gt; was spoken of as the legendary Champion of the Games. Tried as I might, I could not find the location of these rumored games, nor could I find anyone who had actually seen any of the battles, even though the inns of Valenwood were alive with tales of Biiri's prowess.\nAfter weeks of futile searching, the tales of the &lt;a href=\"Valenwood%20Arena\"&gt;Valenwood Arena&lt;/a&gt; evaporated as quickly as they started. Somehow, some way, a massive, hidden arena of multiple levels simply vanished. I assumed this was just further proof that the stories were more legend than truth, but still the idea of the place nagged at me. It haunted my dreams and interrupted my thoughts at the oddest moments.\nWhen next I heard rumors of a mysterious and secret Arena, I was in &lt;a href=\"Windhelm%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Windhelm&lt;/a&gt; for the &lt;a href=\"Jorunn\"&gt;Skald-King's&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Konunleikar\"&gt;Konunleikar&lt;/a&gt;. In the shadows of the dingy mead halls, rough and tumble Nords described a magical battlegrounds where the environment changed with every match. To earn a victory meant getting to fight another match. To find defeat was to experience a bloody and violent death. It sounded gruesome and fascinating to me, and the Nords drank it up like it was the sweetest beverage they ever tasted.\nThe place was called the &lt;a href=\"Skyrim%20Arena\"&gt;Skyrim Arena&lt;/a&gt;, but I was never able to locate an entrance to the battlegrounds. This time they spoke of the glorious victories of &lt;a href=\"Holgstad%20the%20Horrible\"&gt;Holgstad the Horrible&lt;/a&gt;. He was supposedly a Nord's Nord. Tall as a &lt;a href=\"Troll%20%28Online%29\"&gt;troll&lt;/a&gt; and twice as powerful, Holgstad was rumored to enter each match carrying a double-bladed axe and a dagger that sparked with lightning. They said he had a trio of Nord shield maidens that fought by his side, and that they were destroying the competition in match after match\u2014much to the approval of the Arena's mysterious patron.\nI think I was getting close to finding the secret location when suddenly the stories stopped. It happened again. This supposedly ancient arena of stone and metal had disappeared as quickly as it had arrived, taking Holgstad and his shield maidens with it. The Nords cheered, drank to their honored champion, and then went back to dealing with the more mundane happenings of the realm.\nI despaired of ever getting that close to the Arena again when I happened to be traveling on one of the &lt;a href=\"Dragonstar%20Caravan%20Company\"&gt;Dragonstar Caravan Company&lt;/a&gt;'s wagons. One of the caravan guards was bragging about how he was going to compete in the &lt;a href=\"Dragonstar%20Arena\"&gt;Dragonstar Arena&lt;/a&gt; when he returned to &lt;a href=\"Craglorn\"&gt;Craglorn&lt;/a&gt; after this run. He knew he was strong enough to challenge the current champion. All he had to do was convince three of his fellow guards to join him so he had a proper team.\nOver drinks around the evening fire, I was able to learn as much as the guard could tell me about the Arena. He explained that it was an ancient ruin that suddenly appeared in the hills behind the town of Dragonstar a few weeks back. Challengers were arriving from all over Craglorn and beyond to compete in the secret games. They had even set up a makeshift camp outside the Arena entrance. I knew this was the Arena I had been searching for, that somehow it changed locations whenever the competition began to falter. That it was capable of moving\u2014stone by stone\u2014across the world.\nNow I'm inside the Arena, hoping to gain access to the games themselves. I need to see how the environments change. I need to determine if it's some amazing feat of ancient engineering or some sort of magic that makes the impossible happen for every match. And I need to determine who the mysterious patron of the Arena actually is. I have suspicions, of course, but I'm sure the truth will turn out to be exceedingly stranger than anything I can imagine."}

The &lt;a href=\"Dragonstar%20Caravan%20Company\"&gt;Dragonstar Caravan Company&lt;/a&gt; has hired me to find the Butcher's hiding place and put an end to his activities.\nA captured Iron Orc finally revealed a few of his secrets after a prolonged session with my hunting knife. I now know where I can find the Butcher. I also learned that he's changed his tactics as of late. Instead of attacking travelers and killing them all before looting their possessions, he and his band have starting taking live captives.\nMy prisoner expired before I could determine what the Butcher wanted living captives for, but I can't imagine it's for anything good. Something tells me that a quick death is preferrable to becoming guests of the Iron Orcs.\nI made my way into the Valley of Scars, barely avoiding the multitude of Iron Orcs that seem to fill the area. I only had to kill a few of the vile creatures, as my skill at stealth and avoiding detection is certainly more than adequate to fool these brutal savages.\nI found the Butcher's camp, tucked into a side alcove in the valley. I can hardly believe it, but the Iron Orcs seem to have trained &lt;a href=\"Troll%20%28Online%29\"&gt;trolls&lt;/a&gt; to serve them in some capacity. Long after this bounty has been collected, the thought of Iron Orcs leading trolls into battle will haunt my nightmares. But even worse, I've discovered why the Butcher has been taking prisoners\u2014he's feeding them to the trolls!\nWell, this outrage must not go unanswered. Bounty or no, the Butcher has made this personal. I will actually take pleasure in removing the foul monster's head from his shoulders. Provided, that is, I can get close enough to do the deed.\nThe Iron Orcs spotted me before I could reach the Butcher. Now I'm trapped and cornered, waiting for the inevitable end. It won't be long before the Iron Orcs reach me. I plan to die fighting, as I have no desire to be fed alive to the Butcher's trolls. I just pray I have the strength to accomplish that plan. "}

I will hear nothing of it. She does not understand the importance of this place to me. The city is too busy and too noisy for me to think clearly.

She will grow to love this place.\n19th Mid Year, &lt;a href=\"Tirdas\"&gt;Tirdas&lt;/a&gt;\nAlyssa is beginning to spend more and more time at her daily baths.

I have worked too hard to get her here.\n22nd Mid Year, &lt;a href=\"Fredas\"&gt;Fredas&lt;/a&gt;\nSpent two hours waiting for my Alyssa to return from her daily bath near the waterfall. She apparently fell asleep. I did not inquire any further, but I did notice scratches and bruises on her forearms and legs. She probably tripped and fell, but was too embarrassed to tell me about it.\n26th Mid Year, Morndas\nThe past few days Alyssa has brought up the subject of leaving this place. Has she already forgotten why we came here in the first place? Has she already forgotten the daily mental torture of conversing with the Inferiors in the city? This constant bickering between us is starting to wear on me and I fear I will not be able to take much more of it.\n27th Mid Year, &lt;a href=\"Middas\"&gt;Middas&lt;/a&gt;\nAlyssa spent nearly four hours today at the waterfall. She said she fell asleep again. I will not be made a fool. I demanded she tell me where she had been. She burst into tears and confessed she no longer wished to stay here with me. That night I did not sleep and the day's events played over and over in my head. In the morning, I made the decision to let Alyssa leave. Let her be free. Let her live life the way she wants. She thanked me, parted with one final kiss, and then took off toward the waterfall. That was the last I saw of my dear Alyssa.\n29th Mid Year, Fredas\nI have done what I know is right, but my heart will not accept it. Only time will heal my heartache, and now it seems I have all the time in the world... alone. I have done the right thing. I had no right to keep her here against her will. The only thing that keeps me sane is knowing she is happy once again and free to do what she wants. I swear I still hear her voice now and then coming from the waterfall, but I know they are only echoes of memory. I must stay strong. I will stay here until my dying days and maybe, just maybe, she will return to me."}

But even the most secure dwelling can harbor a deadly secret. In the case of &lt;a href=\"Baenlin\"&gt;Baenlin&lt;/a&gt;, an elderly Elf nobleman who had called Bruma home for nearly forty-three years, death came not from the icy cold, nor from the sting of a burglar's blade, but from a killer far more insidious -- structural instability.According to &lt;a href=\"Gromm\"&gt;Gromm&lt;/a&gt;, Baenlin's longtime live-in manservant, the day of his master's death was like any other. Baenlin lived as a recluse, and rarely left the comfort of his home. He spent his morning breakfasting, and his afternoons reading or napping, but it was in the late evening hours before bedtime, when Baenlin relaxed in his favorite chair as was his custom, when disaster struck. A stuffed &lt;a href=\"Minotaur%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;Minotaurhead&lt;/a&gt; mounted on the wall directly over the chair came crashing down, killing the unsuspecting noble instantly.As horrible as Baenlin's death may seem, even more horrible is the revelation that this was not an isolated incident, as previously thought. In fact, through a series of interviews and an in-depth investigation, the &lt;a href=\"Black%20Horse%20Courier\"&gt;Black Horse Courier&lt;/a&gt; has learned that many of Bruma's homes are actually deathtraps waiting to spring.\"Me and my boys, we done repair work on half these houses. They're a bleedin' mess! Rotted wood, rusty nails, misaligned foundations. Them &lt;a href=\"Nords%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;Nords&lt;/a&gt;, they're good for drinkin' and killin', but they can't build a house worth a damn!\"\nSo said &lt;a href=\"Antoine%20Dubois\"&gt;Antoine Dubois&lt;/a&gt;, owner of &lt;a href=\"Dubois%20and%20Sons%20Carpentry\"&gt;Dubois and Sons Carpentry&lt;/a&gt;, a thriving house-building business headquartered in the &lt;a href=\"Bretons%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;Breton&lt;/a&gt; nation of &lt;a href=\"High%20Rock\"&gt;High Rock&lt;/a&gt;. Because of his expertise, Dubois has been known to offer his services throughout the &lt;a href=\"Empire\"&gt;Empire&lt;/a&gt;, and has visited Bruma on numerous occasions. In his opinion, this predominantly Nord city features some of the most poorly-constructed dwellings in all the Empire.\n\"Yeah, I know what the Nords say. It's the snow! It's rots the wood, it does this, it does that. Whine, whine, whine! The &lt;a href=\"Mead%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;mead&lt;/a&gt;-swillin' savages wouldn't know oakwood from oranges. Truth is, they just don't know anything about the latest architectural methods. The work is unsafe and sloppy. That head that fell on the Elf? An infant could've secured those bindings better! It's no wonder they came loose! But I've seen this type of thing all over Bruma. Did you know that until I came in to do repair work on the roof, you couldn't attend a service in the Chapel without getting snowed on? Now that's just wrong.\" \nWhen asked what he thought of the issues, Baenlin's nephew, &lt;a href=\"Caenlin\"&gt;Caenlin&lt;/a&gt;, who inherited his uncle's estate and is now residing in the very house where he was killed, had this to say: \n\"It was a tragic, tragic accident. I always told my poor uncle that head would fall on him some day, but would he listen? Now, I've heard the rumors that some think there was foul play involved, but that's nonsense, of course. Everybody knows this city is falling apart. It could have happened to anyone.\" \nAnd so, as the city of Bruma mourns the loss of one of its oldest and most respected residents, there are those who can't help but wonder -- am I next?"}

All trainers are able to train three different skills. Many trainers offer their services from the start of the game. Some of the trainers will only offer their services to members of their &lt;a href=\"Factions%20%28Morrowind%29\"&gt;faction&lt;/a&gt; or after a certain task has been achieved.\nCost.\nAll training requires that a fee be paid. &lt;a href=\"Septim%20%28Coin%29\"&gt;Gold&lt;/a&gt; is automatically subtracted from the &lt;a href=\"inventory\"&gt;inventory&lt;/a&gt; when a training session is accepted. The cost per level of training varies on three primary factors; &lt;a href=\"Personality%20%28Morrowind%29\"&gt;personality&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"disposition\"&gt;disposition&lt;/a&gt;, and current level in the skill being trained. The cost of training increases with each level of skill gained.\nTrainers, that are also merchants, will add gold paid to them for training to their available gold amount only if their \"barter\" is accessed prior to training. In this manner it is possible to pay for training, then sell them items to recover the gold spent.\nProficiency.\nThere is no cap on how often a skill can be trained in this manner, skills can be trained often as a player wishes. Assuming they have found a trainer of adequate level, as all trainers have a maximum level to which they can increase a skill. Once the skill is equal to the trainers, then no further training is available from them, although the skill will still be listed (with a price) in the training menu.\nTrainers.\nTrainers can often be found in guildhalls, corner clubs, council manors, Legion forts, Imperial chapels, and Tribunal temples. Some of the higher level trainers are hard to find and in out of the way places."}
{"id": "17449", "revid": "25646820", "url": "https://elderscrolls.fandom.com/wiki?curid=17449", "title": "Trainers (Oblivion)", "text": "Trainers increase certain &lt;a href=\"Skills%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;skills&lt;/a&gt; in exchange for &lt;a href=\"Septim%20%28Coin%29\"&gt;gold&lt;/a&gt;. Training can be used five times per level only. Training a skill in this way costs 10 x \"current skill level\" (e.g., raising a skill from 24 to 25 costs 240g). Note that \"current skill level\" for the purpose of the payment is calculated after modifiers, e.g. from enchanted armor. Therefore, it\u00a0is cheaper if skill-boosting gear is unequipped before entering a training session.\nMechanics.\nDrain \"Skill\" also affects the amount of gold paid to a trainer. Through use of potions, poisons, spells or enchantments it is possible to reduce a skill temporarily to 0, or as low as your character can manage. Doing this will allow you to train one level for free (or a reduced cost). It is possible to train 5 times at no charge if one reapplies the Drain Skill between each free training session. So long as the player's current skill level is 0 the game will not charge for training. If only one application of Drain Skill is done then the next level will then cost 10 and so on adding to a total of 100g for 5 levels in that skill if reduced completely to 0. When the Drain effect wears out your skill will return to its actual level plus however many you trained. This method can save quite a bit of gold, effectively reducing the cost of training a skill by up to 900 or more gold per level. Drain Skill effects from two separate sources are required to lower skill to zero when it is naturally 101\u2013200.\nIt is very useful to increase the 100 first points of the major skill without leveling, and then train 5 points per level in that skill. In that way, full stats and very high level is possible.\nMaster-level training.\nThere is one master trainer for each skill and a number of either apprentice, journeyman, or expert trainers scattered throughout the country. In order to be trained by the master trainer a quest needs to be completed, a quest given by one of the expert trainers in the skill. The quest will involve finding the master trainer and then doing something for them. Only a journeyman/an expert level trainer can give you the requisite training quest, and will only do so once you have achieved level 70 in the appropriate skill.\nBusiness hours.\nLike &lt;a href=\"Merchants%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;merchants&lt;/a&gt; (including &lt;a href=\"Spell%20Merchants%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;spell merchants&lt;/a&gt;), skill trainers are only \"open for business\" at certain times of the day. So, you may find yourself talking to one of these people without the training icon showing up. This will happen if they are busy as well; for example, some trainers may train from sunrise to sunset, but if they visit the chapels they will not train during prayer. In such cases you will have to wait it out and possibly follow them around. Masters, at least, appear to offer training at all times, and also stay in the same place. The only master that does not stay in the same place is &lt;a href=\"Alawen\"&gt;Alawen&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"Skill%20Perk%23Marksman%20Perks\"&gt;Master&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Marksman%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;marksman&lt;/a&gt; trainer. She will go a little NE of &lt;a href=\"Troll%20Candle%20Camp\"&gt;her camp&lt;/a&gt; and stand there till later on in the day and come back to her camp.\n&lt;a href=\"Heavy%20Armor%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;Heavy Armor&lt;/a&gt; Trainers.\nOr simply go to the Imperial City Market District and buy the items from &lt;a href=\"Jensine%27s%20%22Good%20As%20New%22%20Merchandise\"&gt;Jensine's \"Good As New\" Merchandise&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Three%20Brothers%20Trade%20Goods\"&gt;Three Brothers Trade Goods&lt;/a&gt;, or &lt;a href=\"The%20Copious%20Coinpurse\"&gt;The Copious Coinpurse&lt;/a&gt;. It may require you to go to more than one of those stores, but you're guaranteed to get the Silver Pitcher and 4 Silver Glasses and he gives you the money anyway plus a tip."}
{"id": "58386", "revid": "25646820", "url": "https://elderscrolls.fandom.com/wiki?curid=58386", "title": "Trainers (Skyrim)", "text": "Trainers are NPCs who help increase proficiency in skills in . Most trainers offer their services from the start of the game, but some require certain tasks to be performed first. Skills can only be trained five times per level, until the skill level exceeds the level of the trainer. All training requires that a fee be paid. &lt;a href=\"Septim%20%28Coin%29\"&gt;Gold&lt;/a&gt; is automatically subtracted from the &lt;a href=\"inventory\"&gt;inventory&lt;/a&gt; when a training session is accepted. After you pay the trainers you can &lt;a href=\"pickpocket\"&gt;pickpocket&lt;/a&gt; them for your money back.\nChanges from previous games.\nUnlike and , trainers in only offer skill leveling from Adept upwards. In previous games, trainers offered Apprentice-level and Novice-level training. There are skill trainers in \"Skyrim\" labeled as \"Common\" trainers; this is incorrectly labeled, as the trainers offer their services up to the Adept level. Unlike \"Morrowind\" and \"Oblivion\", there are no means to be trained all the way to level 100 in a skill. One thing that carried over from Oblivion is that trainers will only train up to five skill levels per character level.\nCost.\nThe more advanced the training session is, the higher it will cost. The cost of training a skill up can be calculated as follows:\nLevels 15\u201350: \"10 * [skill level] + 50\"\nLevels 51\u201375: \"30 * [skill level] + 50\"\nLevels 75\u201390: \"50 * [skill level] + 50\"\nThis cost is based on the skill level after all modifications. So for example, &lt;a href=\"Speech\"&gt;Speech&lt;/a&gt; training while wearing an &lt;a href=\"Amulet%20of%20Dibella\"&gt;Amulet of Dibella&lt;/a&gt; will be priced at a level 15 points higher than the raw skill level. It is thus best to remove relevant equipment before training.\nTrainers that are also &lt;a href=\"Merchants%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;merchants&lt;/a&gt;, such as &lt;a href=\"Arcadia\"&gt;Arcadia&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Whiterun%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Whiterun&lt;/a&gt;, add the gold paid to them for training into their inventory. One can easily recover gold spent on training by selling them items. The gold can also be pickpocketed back from the trainer, albeit difficult if it is a large amount.\nProficiencies.\nThe proficiency of trainers varies:\nOnce the Dragonborn's skill level is greater than or equal to the trainer's level, the option for training disappears as there is no more that can be learned from this person.\nFree training.\nThere are several quests or tasks available that grant free skill increases as a reward. They function much like &lt;a href=\"Skill%20Books%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;skill books&lt;/a&gt; and are treated in the same way as regular skill increases.\nExploits.\nFree training can be exploited if a &lt;a href=\"Followers%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;follower&lt;/a&gt; is also a trainer. Upon completion of a training session, the option to trade items with a follower can be selected to access their inventory and the Dragonborn can then recover the amount spent on training.\nThere are only seven trainers who are followers:\nAdditionally, gold can be pickpocketed back after training sessions, but this becomes impossible at higher levels (even with maximum Pickpocket and &lt;a href=\"Sneak%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Sneak&lt;/a&gt; skills) as the amount of gold paid is often in the thousands. This can be surmounted by knocking down the trainer in some way, and then pickpocketing the gold back while they are on the ground. You can pickpocket anything in a knocked down character's inventory with no &lt;a href=\"Bounty%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;bounty&lt;/a&gt;, even if the chance of success appears to be 0%. To knock down a character, use &lt;a href=\"Unrelenting%20Force%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Unrelenting Force&lt;/a&gt; with all three &lt;a href=\"words%20of%20power\"&gt;words of power&lt;/a&gt;, do a &lt;a href=\"Power%20Attack%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;power attack&lt;/a&gt; with a two-handed weapon (you may receive a bounty), or, with the \"&lt;a href=\"Poisoned%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Poisoned&lt;/a&gt;\" perk, reverse-pickpocket a &lt;a href=\"Paralyze%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;paralysis&lt;/a&gt; poison into their inventory. The player can also use &lt;a href=\"Ice%20Form\"&gt;Ice Form&lt;/a&gt; on the trainer and then heal the character, then while the person is recovering, quickly access that trainer's inventory to recoup the cost. It is possible to prevent a crime being charged against the &lt;a href=\"Last%20Dragonborn\"&gt;Dragonborn&lt;/a&gt; by first joining the faction that the trainer belongs to."}

All this lying, all this pretending! &lt;a href=\"Sithis\"&gt;Sithis&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Five%20Tenets\"&gt;Five Tenets&lt;/a&gt; be damned! How long do I have to live by their rules? How long before I get my chance? I saw &lt;a href=\"Lucien%20Lachance%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;Lucien Lachance&lt;/a&gt; yesterday. He was in the Sanctuary talking with &lt;a href=\"Ocheeva\"&gt;Ocheeva&lt;/a&gt;. He was right there! So close I could have severed his spine in less than a heartbeat! Oh Mother, never before have I had to exercise such self-control. What's sickeningly ironic is that it was the &lt;a href=\"Dark%20Brotherhood%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;Dark Brotherhood's&lt;/a&gt; discipline that allowed me to restrain myself. I've been a part of their \"family\" for so long it's a part of me, whether I like it or not. And in all that time I've fooled them all. They see me as a fellow member of the Brother, a trusted family member. Some day soon I will learn the truth about the &lt;a href=\"Night%20Mother\"&gt;Night Mother&lt;/a&gt;, and when I do, I will use that trust to get close to her. Close enough so that I may rend the head from her body, just as Lucien Lachance did to you so long ago!\nDamn it, mother! Why did it have to be this way? Maria was so beautiful. She was perfect in so many ways. Why couldn't she handle the truth? Why couldn't she realize her \"family\" didn't really love her? She was a murderer like the rest of us. Paid to kill in the name of Sithis. I really thought we could be together. Make a real family, with real love. But she told me she could never accept your place in my life. So now she's gone. She didn't deserve to live after the horrible things she said about you. I never should have told her, I know. I'm so sorry. It will never happen again, and the others will never find her, don't worry. There's nothing left of her to find.\nI like to lie in the grass and watch the ants and wish I\nwere one of them in their undergound maze so safe from the\ndarkness of people horrible people I will kill them\nall kill the ants kill the people kill everything\nI did it, mother! I killed them all! I killed them and I cursed them to wander their &lt;a href=\"The%20Serpent%27s%20Wake\"&gt;ship&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Undead%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;undeath&lt;/a&gt; for all eternity! They came to talk to the old man in the lighthouse. When they saw me, they could have kept walking. But no. They laughed! They laughed at me, mother! They called me names! They said I was strange, that I was a human rat, living here in the cellar of the lighthouse. They did not know who they were dealing with! So I snuck on board, later that night, and I slit their throats. Every last one of them. So there the Serpent's Wake sits. The ghost ship of Anvil they'll call it now! Ha ha ha ha ha!\nSome wonderful news, mother! Advancement at last! Lucien Lachance paid a visit to the Sanctuary today, to talk with me! He told me the &lt;a href=\"Black%20Hand\"&gt;Black Hand&lt;/a&gt; needed my services. One of the other &lt;a href=\"Speaker\"&gt;Speaker&lt;/a&gt;s is looking to replace his assistant, who was killed fulfilling a contract. So Lucien Lachance suggested me! I met with the Speaker, and will serve as his new \"Silencer.\" Ha! Lachance might as well have given me a contract to kill the Night Mother herself! I am now one step closer to realizing our dream. I will learn the Night Mother's identity and tear the heart from her chest. Oh yes, and I have something special planned for Lachance himself...\nmommy I so afrade. i mis yu mommy. i just wantyu to kis me agenn\nfather prayed and guess who came the hooded man in Sithis' name who left but then he came once more to pass through window wall and door I lie in fear my mouth a gape as wicked blade did cleave your nape for I was watching beneath the bed to see the falling of your head and when your face lie on the floor our loving eyes did meet once more and so I pledged to you that day the Brotherhood would dearly pay and just as they took me from you I'd find and kill their mother too but there's someplace I need to start and that's with father's beating heart and when that's done I'll sing and dance to celebrate a dead LaChance\ngreenblueREDyelloworangegreenblueREDyelloworangegreenblueREDyelloworange\ngreenblueREDyelloworangegreenblueREDyelloworangegreenblueREDyelloworange\ngreenblueREDyelloworangeBLACKBLACKBLACKBLACKBLACK!!!!!!\nI've been careless! Too careless. The bodies, the burnings. Killing that fool Blanchard was the worst mistake I've made so far. I was seen! I was cloaked and hooded, and escaped into shadow, so no one learned my true identity. But now the Black Hand is suspicious. They suspect treachery, suspect a traitor! I must be more cautious than ever.\nwhen in the snow I like to lie and fold my arms and wait to die\nI've been switching them! Switching the dead drops! It was so easy! I tracked Lachance from his lair at &lt;a href=\"Fort%20Farragut\"&gt;Fort Farragut&lt;/a&gt; to the first dead drop location. After Lachance placed the orders, when I was sure he was gone, I switched them! It was so easy. Now Lachance's fool Silencer is working for us, mother! Oh, the fun we'll have. One of the Black Hand told me they haven't seen such an ambitious family member since I first joined the Dark Brotherhood. I will use that very ambition to my own advantage. The fool will never question the dead drops, and as I write this is en route to the first target -- one of the very members of the Black Hand! And so it begins. Lachance's silencer will kill one high ranking Brother member, then another, then another, and so on, until the entire family implodes. Eventually, as is the custom, the survivors will consult the Night Mother and seek her guidance. When that day comes, I will be there, ready to punge a blade into that dark whore's fetid heart!\n!eid lliw ecnahcaL neicuL"}

Traitor's Tor was the last stand of &lt;a href=\"King%20Ranser\"&gt;King Ranser&lt;/a&gt; before he was killed by his traitorous general Dathieu, hence the name.\nDescription.\nGeography.\nTraitor's Tor is situated in the &lt;a href=\"Westmark%20Moor\"&gt;Westmark Moor&lt;/a&gt; region and east of the modern-day city-state of Shornhelm. Traitor's Tor is a large fortress built on a hill that overlooks southern Rivenspire. It is built in a rectangular shape, with a tower in the center. All along the southern side are broken walls. There are five towers along the walls, two on each side of the gate, two on the west and east wall, and one on the northern wall. The nearest settlement to Traitor's Tor is the township of &lt;a href=\"Hoarfrost%20Downs\"&gt;Hoarfrost Downs&lt;/a&gt;.\nHistory.\n&lt;a href=\"Second%20Era\"&gt;Second Era&lt;/a&gt;.\nAfter the devastating loss at the &lt;a href=\"Battle%20of%20Markwasten%20Moor\"&gt;Battle of Markwasten Moor&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"King%20Ranser\"&gt;King Ranser&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"Shornhelm\"&gt;Shornhelm&lt;/a&gt; gathered what little of his militia was left and traveled to a nameless tor that overlooked the destroyed city of Shornhelm. It was here Ranser decided to take drastic measures, by trying to turn his own soldiers into immortal warriors. The Orcish warriors continued to attack the Shornhelm warriors as Ranser started the ritual. But he was killed by &lt;a href=\"General%20Dathieu\"&gt;General Dathieu&lt;/a&gt;, his loyal general, it triggered the ritual and turned everyone into undead warriors, standing at Ranser's side forever. Instead of pursuing the &lt;a href=\"Daggerfall%20Covenant\"&gt;Daggerfall Covenant&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"High%20King%20Emeric\"&gt;High King Emeric&lt;/a&gt;, Ranser ordered his men to hold their position and defend the tor. Time eventually flew and the tor would be named Traitor's Tor.\nDuring the &lt;a href=\"Interregnum\"&gt;Interregnum&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"2E%20582\"&gt;2E 582&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Scholar%20Cantier\"&gt;Scholar Cantier&lt;/a&gt; of Shornhelm traveled to Traitor's Tor, attempting to learn everything about Ranser's final bout. Cantier gained the help of a &lt;a href=\"Vestige\"&gt;traveler&lt;/a&gt; who encountered the skull of General Dathieu, who would then show the traveler visions of the past, that led to Ranser's demise. With the information, the traveler gathered the bones of Dathieu and it resurrects both Dathieu and Ranser. In the end, Ranser was ultimately defeated and the spirits at Traitor's Tor were able to ascend into &lt;a href=\"Aetherius\"&gt;Aetherius&lt;/a&gt;. From that day on, Ranser's fate was told throughout Rivenspire and Traitor's Tor remained utterly abandoned.\nBy the time of the &lt;a href=\"Tiber%20Wars\"&gt;Tiber Wars&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"2E%20864\"&gt;2E 864&lt;/a&gt;, the Tor had become known as Gelders Tot and was still marked on maps."}

Both transmutation and reconstruction require Transmutation Crystals. Transmutation was introduced in &lt;a href=\"Update%2016\"&gt;Update 16&lt;/a&gt;, while reconstruction was not introduced until &lt;a href=\"Update%2028\"&gt;Update 28&lt;/a&gt; with Item Set Collections.\nOnly one regular Transmutation Station exists in the &lt;a href=\"Hall%20of%20Refined%20Techniques\"&gt;Hall of Refined Techniques&lt;/a&gt; of the &lt;a href=\"Brass%20Fortress\"&gt;Brass Fortress&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Clockwork%20City%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Clockwork City&lt;/a&gt;, but others can be present in &lt;a href=\"Homestead%20%28Online%29\"&gt;player housing&lt;/a&gt;.

They are applied to an entire account and are accessible by all of an account's characters at any time; as such, they cannot be banked or transferred. Unlike other currencies, a maximum of 500 crystals, or 1,00 for &lt;a href=\"ESO%20Plus\"&gt;ESO Plus&lt;/a&gt; members, can be possessed at any one time, up from 100 prior to Update 28. Crystals are usually provided in the form of &lt;a href=\"Transmutation%20Geode\"&gt;Transmutation Geode&lt;/a&gt;s and &lt;a href=\"Uncracked%20Transmutation%20Geode\"&gt;Uncracked Transmutation Geode&lt;/a&gt;s, the former of which is provided by regular dungeons and similar less difficult activities, and the latter of which is provided by veteran dungeons and other more difficult activities. An &lt;a href=\"Tester%27s%20Infinite%20Transmutation%20Geode\"&gt;infinite&lt;/a&gt; supply of crystals is provided in the &lt;a href=\"Public%20Test%20Server\"&gt;Public Test Server&lt;/a&gt;.\nCrystals are obtained from completing various player-versus-enemy and player-versus-player activities:\nTransmutation.\nTransmutation is the process of changing an items trait from one to another. A character needs to have learned the trait they want to change an item to for that specific item, i.e. Even if &lt;a href=\"Training\"&gt;Training&lt;/a&gt; is known for one item, it cannot be transmuted for another item if it is not known for that item. Transmuted items also become account bound, meaning that they cannot be traded to other players, sold in &lt;a href=\"Guild%20Trading\"&gt;guild stores&lt;/a&gt;, or stored in &lt;a href=\"guild%20bank\"&gt;guild bank&lt;/a&gt;s. They can, however, be stored in regular &lt;a href=\"Banks%20%28Online%29\"&gt;banks&lt;/a&gt; or sold to regular &lt;a href=\"Merchants%20%28Online%29\"&gt;merchants&lt;/a&gt;.\nItems that have been transmuted cannot have their trait learned at a crafting station, meaning that an item cannot be transmuted for the purpose of having another character learn the trait it has been transmuted to. This is especially relevant for the &lt;a href=\"Nirnhoned\"&gt;Nirnhoned&lt;/a&gt; trait, as without knowing the trait itself to craft one, Nirnhoned items can only be obtained from the quest \"&lt;a href=\"Dawn%20of%20the%20Exalted%20Viper%20%28Quest%29\"&gt;Dawn of the Exalted Viper&lt;/a&gt;\" (one random item), or by purchasing them from other players who have crafted their own. Despite this, transmuted items will provide the trait's &lt;a href=\"crafting%20material\"&gt;crafting material&lt;/a&gt; when it is deconstructed at a crafting station at the same frequency as any other item.\nReconstruction.\nItems that are a part of sets that cannot be crafted can be reconstructed if the character has possessed the item previously. The number of crystals necessary to reconstruct the item is based on how many items are in the set and how many are known, provided by formula_1 rounded down, which results in a range from 25 to 75. Deconstructing a reconstructed item at a crafting table will not provide any crafting materials, but will refund 25 , regardless of how many where actually spent to produce it. Like transmuted items, reconstructed items are account bound, meaning that they cannot be traded to other players, sold in guild stores, or stored in guild banks. They can, however, be stored in regular banks or sold to regular merchants.\nAll reconstructed items can be made without using quality improvement resources, making it the baseline quality for most reconstructed items, but requires , or improvement resources respective to the class of item that is being created. Sets related to more difficult content such as trials and some arenas will have a higher baseline quality, and will not need or even quality improvement resources. The number of improvement resources needed corresponds to how many Expertise ranks the character has for the related crafting skill. All reconstructed items can be made with any trait that has already been learned for the item type without using any trait resources."}

A different man might not have, I know that, and from time to time, I think back on the hour when I saw the gold and took it. You see, I was hungry. Isn't it ironic.\nI don't remember much else about that night but the gold and the hunger. I don't remember the name of the tavern, or even the village, but I believe it was somewhere in southern &lt;a href=\"Vvardenfell\"&gt;Vvardenfell&lt;/a&gt;. I can't really be certain. For some time, I sat dumbly in my chair, my mind occupied with nothing but the pain in my stomach. If you've never been truly hungry from days of no food, you can't know what it's like. You can't concentrate on anything. It wasn't until a figure to my left got up from the table to get a drink and left a stack of gold marks behind that I snapped to awareness.\nFrom this moment on, my memory is crystalline.\nMy eyes to the gold. My eyes to the stranger's back, walking calmly toward the barmaid. My hand to the gold. The gold in my pocket. I'm up from the table, and out the door. For just a moment, I look back. The stranger has turned to look my way. He wears a hood, but I can feel his eyes meet mine. I swear, I can scent a smile.\nOut into the street, and behind some barrels I crouched down, waiting for my pursuer. One benefit of a lifetime running from guards, I know how to disappear. For nearly an hour, I waited there, suffering even more from hunger. You see, I was awake now and I had the means to buy myself a feast. This knowledge tortured me. When I finally got to my feet, I very nearly fainted. I had only enough energy to walk to the other edge of the village to a run-down tavern before collapsing at a table. I think I must have fallen unconscious for a moment before I heard the barmaid's voice.\n\u201cCan I get you something to eat, sera?\u201d\nI gorged myself on roasts and pies and huge frothing mugs of &lt;a href=\"greef\"&gt;greef&lt;/a&gt;. As the fog of near fatal starvation began to lift, I looked up from my plate to see a gold-masked stranger looking at me, his vizard glowing by the blinding light of the moon through the window. He wore black leather armor and was a different physique and size from the man I had burgled, but I could tell he knew. I paid for my meal quickly and left.\nI skirted the edge of the village, through a tiled central courtyard surrounded by the squalid peasant's cottages. There was not a light shining from any window or door. No one was on the streets. I could find no place to hide, so I took the road out of town, heading for the wilderness. Hunger had pushed me on in the days before, but now I felt what I imagined to be the whip of guilt. Or perhaps, even then, it was fear.\nI fell twice, rushing down the dark path, unused to the slopes and pebbled texture. The sounds of animal life, which I had numbed to, were suddenly very loud in my ears. And there was something else out there in the night, something chasing me.\nOn the side of the road, there was a low wall, and I scrambled over it and hid. I knew enough about concealment to pick a spot where the bulwark sunk slightly so even if someone saw the outline of my figure, he would assume it to be part of the wall. It wasn't long before I heard the sound of running footsteps from more than one person pass me by and then stop. There was a moment of whispered conversation, and one of the people ran back on the path toward the village. Then, silence.\nAfter a few more minutes, I peered out from behind the wall. A female figure in a dun gown, wimple, and veil stood in the road. On the other end of the road, blocking the way back to town, was a knight, coated in dark mail. I could see neither of their faces. For a moment, I froze, unsure whether either or both had seen me.\n\u201cRun,\u201d said the woman in a dead voice.\nThe hill behind me was too steep, so I leapt over the wall and across the road in two bounds. Into the night forest I ran, the maddening jingle of the accursed gold in my pocket. I knew I was making so much noise my pursuers could not help but hear me, but now I cared more for putting distance between us than in stealth. Clouds of ash filtered through the moonlight, but I still knew it was too bright to hide. I ran and ran until I felt all my blood pumping in my head and heart, begging me to stop.\nI was at the edge of the wood, on the other side of a shallow stream from a vast, crumbling house encircled by a rail fence. Behind me, running footfall in the broken, dusty earth. To the south, downstream, a distinct sodden splashing of someone moving nearer.\nThere was no choice. I half jumped and half fell into the mud and dragged myself up the bank on the other side. I rolled under the fence and ran through the open field toward the house. Jerking my head around, I saw seven shadowy figures by the fence posts. The cloaked man I had robbed. The man in the gold mask. The veiled woman. The dark knight. Three others too who had pursued me, but I had never seen. And I thought I was the stealthy one.\nThe moon was entirely hidden in a swarm of ash. Only the stars offered their meager illumination as I reached the open door of the ruin. I slammed and bolted the door behind me, but I knew there could be no protection for very long. As I looked about the ravaged interior of broken furniture, I searched for someone to hide. A corner, a niche where if I stayed very still, no one would see me.\nA splintered table lying against the wall looked perfect for my purposes. I crawled under it, and jumped when something moved and I heard a frightened old man's voice.\n\u201cWho's there?\u201d\n\u201cIt's all right,\u201d I whispered. \u201cI'm not one of them.\u201d\nHis puckered, gnarled hand reached out from the shadow and gripped my arm. Instantly, I felt sleep fall upon me, resist it as I might. The old man's horrible face, the face of the hungry dead, emerged as the moon came out and shone through the broken window. His talon still gripping me, I fell back, smelling his death surround me.\nThe table was thrown back. There stood the seven hunters and a dozen more. No, hunters they weren't. They were harriers who had chased me out of every hiding place, expertly pushing me to the lair of the real predator. He was weak with age, the old man was, not as good at the chase as once he was. A blunt, killing machine.\n\u201cPlease,\u201d I said. It was all I could muster.\nHaving enjoyed the sport I offered, he granted me mercy, of sorts. I was not bled dry. I was not cursed by being made one of them, the Berne. I was kept with others, most of us mad with fear, to be aged and tasted at the vampires' whim. We are called &lt;a href=\"Vampire%20Cattle\"&gt;cattle&lt;/a&gt;.\nI lost all hope months ago of ever leaving the dank cellar where they keep us. Even if this note finds its way to the outside world, I cannot give enough information about my whereabouts to be rescued, even if some champion were able to defeat the bloodsuckers. I only write this to keep my own sanity, and to warn others.\nThere is something worse than being hungry.\nBeing food."}

Each of the captains represented his longboat and its crew. Since the Five Hundred Companions didn't have strict hierarchical rule over its members, the Circle didn't have actual power over anyone. However, meeting of the Circle were assembled as the Five Hundred had to decide their further course of action or had other serious matters that needed discussion.\nHistory.\nMerethic Era.\nReturn.\nFor the very first time the Circle of Captains was assembled during the events of the so-called\u00a0&lt;a href=\"The%20Return\"&gt;Return&lt;/a&gt;. First set goal of the Five Hundred had been recently completed. Shortly after arriving at &lt;a href=\"Hsaarik%20Head\"&gt;Hsaarik Head&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Tamriel\"&gt;Tamriel&lt;/a&gt;, known to the &lt;a href=\"Nede\"&gt;Nede&lt;/a&gt;s as Mereth during the time, the Companions had reclaimed &lt;a href=\"Saarthal\"&gt;Saarthal&lt;/a&gt;. Five Hundred had to decide what to do next as there was a huge unexplored continent ready for taming and countless &lt;a href=\"Mer\"&gt;elves&lt;/a&gt; to slay.\nDuring the first assembly it was decided that every captain and its crew should go their own way. As a result, the Five Hundred Companions spread all over Tamriel.\nSecond Era.\n&lt;a href=\"Kyrnil%20Long-Nose\"&gt;Kyrnil Long-Nose&lt;/a&gt; began the tradition of trusted advisors called &lt;a href=\"The%20Circle\"&gt;The Circle&lt;/a&gt; (named after &lt;a href=\"Ysgramor\"&gt;Ysgramor&lt;/a&gt;'s council of captains). This would serve as an examples to the younger, newer Companions.\nFourth Era.\nTraditions of the Circle were kept despite the thousands of years that had been passed since the original assembly. The idea of veteran members of &lt;a href=\"The%20Companions\"&gt;The Companions&lt;/a&gt; forming meeting to discuss most serious matters was still present during the &lt;a href=\"Fourth%20Era\"&gt;Fourth Era&lt;/a&gt;.\nHowever, along with many other things, the Circle was different from its original. Most noticeable change being the name itself. In the Fourth Era the assembly is simply referred to as \"The Circle\" as the rank of captain had been lost."}

She lets the &lt;a href=\"Vestige\"&gt;Vestige&lt;/a&gt; try to read the book, and they are transported to &lt;a href=\"Circus%20of%20Cheerful%20Slaughter%20%28Location%29\"&gt;Circus of Cheerful Slaughter&lt;/a&gt;.\nSheogorath wants to put on a play about the &lt;a href=\"Mages%20Guild%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Mages Guild&lt;/a&gt; and the alliances. He enlists the Vestige to help.\nWalkthrough.\n&lt;a href=\"Arch-Mage%20Shalidor\"&gt;Arch-Mage Shalidor&lt;/a&gt; informs the &lt;a href=\"Vestige\"&gt;Vestige&lt;/a&gt; that &lt;a href=\"Valaste\"&gt;Valaste&lt;/a&gt; is having trouble understanding the latest tome and may need the Vestige's help. Shalidor urges the Vestige to visit her as soon as possible. Shalidor claims this last tome is \"nothing but nonsense\" and blames it on the Mad God being \"a deranged skeever.\"\nAt the Guildhall, Valaste complains about the tome making no sense even after translating it, unlike the previous two tomes. She fears she may be missing something. The Vestige offers to read the tome, which can be found on a desk near Valaste. Upon reading the tome, the Vestige is transported to the &lt;a href=\"Shivering%20Isles\"&gt;Shivering Isles&lt;/a&gt; and to where &lt;a href=\"Sheogorath%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Sheogorath&lt;/a&gt; is waiting. &lt;a href=\"Haskill%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Haskill&lt;/a&gt; is also present, and if spoken to, he will simply praise the Vestige for their punctuality. \nSheogorath welcomes the Vestige to the &lt;a href=\"Circus%20of%20Cheerful%20Slaughter%20%28Location%29\"&gt;Circus of Cheerful Slaughter&lt;/a&gt; and calls the Vestige the \"star\" of the show. He claims the Vestige is going to perform a play he wrote himself called \"The Folly of Isolation,\" a tragedy and a comedy, both at once, or as he calls it, \"a tromedy.\" Sheogorath explains if the Vestige wants the next tome, he needs to be entertained. He says he can only light &lt;a href=\"Maleel%20al-Akir\"&gt;Prince Maleel&lt;/a&gt; - who can be seen standing behind Sheogorath - on fire so many times before it gets boring. \nSheogorath says the play is set in &lt;a href=\"Tamriel\"&gt;Tamriel&lt;/a&gt; and is about the &lt;a href=\"Alliance%20War\"&gt;Alliance War&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Mages%20Guild\"&gt;Mages Guild&lt;/a&gt;, the latter which does not want anything to do with the war. The play has three acts, and the Vestige's job is to isolate members of the Mages Guild from the \"bloodthirsty, political, and warmongering sons of silkworms,\" by killing them.\nSheogorath proceeds to set Prince Maleel on fire, causing the &lt;a href=\"Mummy%20%28Online%29\"&gt;undead&lt;/a&gt; Prince to run away in the direction of the first act of the play, as Sheogorath intended. Once the conversation is over, the Vestige can find &lt;a href=\"The%20Folly%20of%20Isolation%2C%20Part%201\"&gt;a note&lt;/a&gt; on a table detailing the first act, and there are other notes detailing the remaining acts elsewhere. Proceeding down the path ahead, the Vestige may find Prince Maleel dead on the ground. Further along, the Vestige will discover a group of spectral individuals standing around in a large circle, called \"Theater Goer.\"\nMoving past them, the Vestige will meet up with Sheogorath. He asks if they are ready and explains the opening act features the &lt;a href=\"Ebonheart%20Pact\"&gt;Ebonheart Pact&lt;/a&gt;, who are currently at peace despite their historical conflicts. Sheogorath claims he's written himself a small part to give the Pact members a little \"push.\" He basically walks over to them and yells, \"Hey! You hate each other, remember?\"\nSheogorath's words seemingly prompt the Pact members to become hostile, forcing the Vestige to kill all of the actors. More actors show up later, going by the names of important individuals, such as &lt;a href=\"Jorunn%20the%20Skald-King\"&gt;Jorunn the Skald-King&lt;/a&gt;. These actors must be killed too. \nFurther along, the Vestige will encounter three spectral individuals. They seem to be a vision of someone's memory. Valaste is among the trio, sitting on the ground and being talked down at by the other two. Another vision further along depicts &lt;a href=\"Vanus%20Galerion%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Vanus Galerion&lt;/a&gt; admitting Valaste into the Mages Guild, who calls it the \"best day of her life.\" A lone vision of Valaste can be found agonizing over the text of a tome she can't make sense of. She accuses herself of being an idiot.\nOnce the Vestige has located Sheogorath, he claims they have paused for a brief intermission. He offers the Vestige some cheese. The Vestige wants to skip it, prompting Sheogorath to explain the next act involves the &lt;a href=\"Aldmeri%20Dominion%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Aldmeri Dominion&lt;/a&gt;. The Vestige correctly guesses they must kill more actors. At the location of the act, &lt;a href=\"Queen%20Ayrenn%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Queen Ayrenn&lt;/a&gt; is giving a speech, during which she murders three actors herself. Once she is done speaking, the Vestige must kill the remaining actors. \nOnce Queen Ayrenn is dead, the Vestige must travel to Sheogorath's location, Along the way, they will encounter more visions involving Valaste and later, Arch-Mage Shalidor. One vision is of Shalidor expressing his joy of finally creating &lt;a href=\"Eyevea\"&gt;Eyevea&lt;/a&gt;, the next vision shows him disregarding the &lt;a href=\"Folium%20Discognitum\"&gt;Folium Discognitum&lt;/a&gt;, which he claims wasn't worth trading Eyevea for. \nThe next vision shows Shalidor cursing Sheogorath, his wife &lt;a href=\"Ulfsild\"&gt;Ulfsild&lt;/a&gt;, and announce he will show everyone how his name will \"ring across history.\" The next vision shows Shalidor hard at work and completely ignoring Ulfsild, who becomes so distressed she abandons her husband. \nOnce the Vestige reaches Sheogorath, he will claim the third act always brings him down because it means the play is almost over. He wants it to go on forever. Sheogorath then inquires about the sideshows and asks if the Vestige enjoyed his little \"illusionary performances.\" The Vestige asks what the third act is about, but Sheogorath refuses to say, preferring to \"show, don't tell.\"\nAfter the conversation, Sheogorath lists out the cast members, which include Valaste, Vanus Galerion and Arch-Mage Shalidor, as well as members of the &lt;a href=\"Daggerfall%20Covenant\"&gt;Daggerfall Covenant&lt;/a&gt;. It soon becomes apparent that the Daggerfall Covenant actors, led by &lt;a href=\"High%20King%20Emeric%20%28Online%29\"&gt;King Emeric&lt;/a&gt;, intend to attack the Mages Guild members. The Vestige must protect them. \nOnce the actors are killed, including King Emeric, the Vestige will approach Sheogorath and request for the tome. Sheogorath says he wasn't impressed with their performance but concedes once the Vestige points out they had a deal. Sheogorath reassures the Vestige that the tome will take them back to the Mages Guildhall. \nThe Vestige must retrieve the tome within the building behind Sheogorath. Inside, they will encounter one final vision. It is of Valaste talking nonsensically to herself about a monkey. Once the Vestige has read the tome, they will return to the Guildhall and see the real Valaste. \nThe Vestige will present the new tome to Valaste, who promises to begin translating it immediately. She rewards the Vestige for their efforts. The Vestige will also explain a bit about the trial and receive commentary from Valaste. Either way, the quest is complete. "}

City Isle gets its name from the fact that the &lt;a href=\"Imperial%20City\"&gt;Imperial City&lt;/a&gt; is located in the middle of the island, the Imperial City being the capital of the province.\nDescription.\nGeography.\nThe majority of the Island is covered by the Imperial City, which is the biggest city in all of Tamriel. The Imperial City has one of the largest sewers systems in Tamriel, which has tunnels throughout the City Isle underground in which it is possible to house an entire army, which was the case during the Imperial City Campaign of the &lt;a href=\"Alliance%20War\"&gt;Alliance War&lt;/a&gt;. Throughout the Rumare coast, tunnels are leading into the sewers and the six different districts in the Imperial City; some sewer entrances extend across &lt;a href=\"Lake%20Rumare\"&gt;Lake Rumare&lt;/a&gt; into the &lt;a href=\"Great%20Forest\"&gt;Great Forest&lt;/a&gt; or the &lt;a href=\"Heartlands\"&gt;Heartlands&lt;/a&gt;. Beyond the Imperial City walls are several caves and minor landmarks. There are small islands located on the main island including &lt;a href=\"Wellspring%20Cave\"&gt;Wellspring Island&lt;/a&gt;, a significant portion of land on the northwest side of the island that is uninhabited by anyone, and the &lt;a href=\"Imperial%20City%20Waterfront\"&gt;Imperial City Waterfront&lt;/a&gt;, which is a small settlement considered a part of the Imperial City; it is where trader ships go to drop off resources into the Imperial City.\nHistory.\n&lt;a href=\"Second%20Era\"&gt;Second Era&lt;/a&gt;.\nDuring the &lt;a href=\"Interregnum\"&gt;Interregnum&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"2E%20582\"&gt;2E 582&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"Daedric\"&gt;Daedric&lt;/a&gt; forces of &lt;a href=\"Molag%20Bal\"&gt;Molag Bal&lt;/a&gt; had taken over the &lt;a href=\"Imperial%20City\"&gt;Imperial City&lt;/a&gt; and infested the entire region. Each of the six district within the city was ruined, with &lt;a href=\"Daedroth\"&gt;Daedroth&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"Flesh%20Colossus\"&gt;Flesh Colossus&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Grievous%20Twilight\"&gt;Grievous Twilight&lt;/a&gt;s roaming the streets. The Imperial City Sewers began to resemble the depths of &lt;a href=\"Coldharbour\"&gt;Coldharbour&lt;/a&gt; when Daedric Rifts and Coldharbour Spikes began to jut out of the ground. The center of the sewers, the &lt;a href=\"Barathrum%20Centrata\"&gt;Barathrum Centrata&lt;/a&gt;, had a large daedric structure with several rifts surrounding the structure. The denizens of the Imperial City were prisoners of war and tortured by the daedric warriors. Some of them were able to escape into the Heartlands or into the edge of the Sewers, where the Alliances of the &lt;a href=\"Alliance%20War\"&gt;Alliance War&lt;/a&gt; were stationed.\n&lt;a href=\"Third%20Era\"&gt;Third Era&lt;/a&gt;.\nBefore the &lt;a href=\"Oblivion%20Crisis\"&gt;Oblivion Crisis&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"3E%20433\"&gt;3E 433&lt;/a&gt;, members of the &lt;a href=\"Septim%20Dynasty\"&gt;Septim Dynasty&lt;/a&gt; were being assassinated by the &lt;a href=\"Mythic%20Dawn\"&gt;Mythic Dawn&lt;/a&gt; Cult of &lt;a href=\"Mehrunes%20Dagon\"&gt;Mehrunes Dagon&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href=\"Emperor%20Uriel%20Septim%20VII\"&gt;Emperor Uriel Septim VII&lt;/a&gt; would escape into the Imperial Sewers with members of &lt;a href=\"the%20Blades\"&gt;the Blades&lt;/a&gt; and a &lt;a href=\"Hero%20of%20Kvatch\"&gt;Prisoner&lt;/a&gt; who just so happened to be put in a cell leading to an escape route. The group was encountered by Mythic Dawn agents who slew Uriel Septim in the sewers, seemingly ending the Septim Dynasty. Believing they had a cosmic purpose, Uriel VII gave the Prisoner the &lt;a href=\"Amulet%20of%20Kings\"&gt;Amulet of Kings&lt;/a&gt; and was sent to &lt;a href=\"Weynon%20Priory\"&gt;Weynon Priory&lt;/a&gt; to meet &lt;a href=\"Jauffre%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;Grandmaster Jauffre&lt;/a&gt; of the Blades. From there, they would start their search to find the &lt;a href=\"Martin%20Septim\"&gt;missing heir&lt;/a&gt; to the Septim Throne and end the impending Oblivion Crisis."}

These guards enforce the law and\u00a0protect\u00a0the capital cities of each County and other villages or settlements within.\nAll city guards wear very similar armor sets, differences are normally just the color of the sash and material of the undershirt used, either steel or chain mail. They also wear the same helmets.\nCity guards also carry a shield which varies in color, and typically displays the insignia of the County across the front.\nCity guards are all from the &lt;a href=\"Imperial%20Legion%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;Imperial Legion&lt;/a&gt; and as such are normally &lt;a href=\"Imperials%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;Imperial&lt;/a&gt;. They all perform the same duties and have the same dialogue, although it may differ depending on the faction they're a part of.\nThe guards are led by a &lt;a href=\"Guard%20Captains\"&gt;captain&lt;/a&gt;, who reports to the local &lt;a href=\"Count\"&gt;Count&lt;/a&gt; or Countess. Their duty is to uphold peace and order throughout the city and county, as well as ensuring justice is had in the event of a crime. Additionally, they are the last line of defense of their city in the event of assault or invasion.\nLevel.\nCity Guards are always ten levels higher than the &lt;a href=\"Hero%20of%20Kvatch\"&gt;Hero&lt;/a&gt;. This means that at level fifty or higher, the City Guards are rather powerful, and have no problem fighting even the strongest of\u00a0&lt;a href=\"Daedra\"&gt;Daedra&lt;/a&gt;.\nImperial Watch.\nThe Imperial Watch are members of the &lt;a href=\"Imperial%20Legion%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;Imperial Legion&lt;/a&gt; who patrol the &lt;a href=\"Imperial%20City%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;Imperial City&lt;/a&gt; and the rest of the province.\nThey normally wear &lt;a href=\"Legion%20Armor\"&gt;Legion Armor&lt;/a&gt; in the Imperial City, while other members of the Watch wear &lt;a href=\"Imperial%20Horseman%20helmet\"&gt;Imperial Horseman helmet&lt;/a&gt;s. The &lt;a href=\"Palace%20Guard\"&gt;Palace Guard&lt;/a&gt; wear a similar version called the \"&lt;a href=\"Imperial%20Watch%20Armor\"&gt;Imperial Watch Armor&lt;/a&gt;.\" This armor is different from the normal guard armor and it looks more like plate armor. A subcategory of the Imperial Watch are the &lt;a href=\"Imperial%20Legion%20Battlemage%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;Legion Battlemages&lt;/a&gt;, who guard the &lt;a href=\"Arcane%20University%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;Arcane University&lt;/a&gt;. They wear the same plate armor as the regular Imperial Watch, but instead of the helmet, they wear a &lt;a href=\"Mage%27s%20Hood\"&gt;hood&lt;/a&gt;. In combat, they will use both a &lt;a href=\"Silver%20Longsword%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;silver longsword&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Destruction%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;Destruction magic&lt;/a&gt;.\nFurthermore, a different type of Imperial Watch can be found around the &lt;a href=\"Imperial%20City%20Palace\"&gt;Imperial City Palace&lt;/a&gt;; Palace Guards. Members of the Palace Guard are clad in a suit similar to the regular &lt;a href=\"Imperial%20Steel%20Armor\"&gt;Imperial Steel Armor&lt;/a&gt;, but colored silver, gold and red.\nCrime.\nWithin the walls of a city, and the surrounding countryside, any crime committed gains the attention of the guards; the nearest will move to the perpetrator, informing them that they have broken the law, and gives three options; pay the fine, resist arrest, or go to jail.\nIf the perpetrator chooses to pay the fine, the guard will take them to the nearest castle and take whatever bounty was placed on them as payment, as well as search them for all stolen item in their possession. If the fine cannot be paid, due to lack of gold, the option will not be given.\nIf the perpetrator accepts the jail sentence, they will be sent to the nearest castle to serve their sentence, based on the size of the bounty; the larger the bounty, the longer the sentence.\nIf the perpetrator resists arrest, the entire guard will immediately engage them, attacking until yielded, or until the perpetrator is dead, or fled from the fight.\nIf the guard has a &lt;a href=\"disposition\"&gt;disposition&lt;/a&gt; of 91 or more, they will not immediately react to a low and non violent crime, looking away as long as the crime is minor.\nDialogue.\nGeneral.\n\"We're here to help.\"\n\"Carry on.\"\n\"Welcome to Anvil.

Quickly, if you please.\" In the section of the Alliance base reserved for various &lt;a href=\"Merchants%20%28Online%29\"&gt;merchants&lt;/a&gt; will be the Drake of Blades herself. She will inform the Vestige that she is a member of the &lt;a href=\"Dragonguard%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Dragonguard&lt;/a&gt; and that she is conducting an investigation that will require their assistance.

The protagonist of each game selects their class during &lt;a href=\"Character%20Creation\"&gt;character creation&lt;/a&gt;. Certain elements such as &lt;a href=\"race\"&gt;race&lt;/a&gt; impact class selection, due to the &lt;a href=\"skill\"&gt;skill set&lt;/a&gt; defaulted by each class. For example, &lt;a href=\"Altmer\"&gt;Altmer&lt;/a&gt; gain bonuses to &lt;a href=\"magic\"&gt;magic&lt;/a&gt;-based skills, making them better suited for the &lt;a href=\"Mage%20%28Class%29\"&gt;mage class&lt;/a&gt; than other races. Each character class features a specialization, several major skills, and an increase in &lt;a href=\"attribute\"&gt;attribute&lt;/a&gt;s at &lt;a href=\"Character%20Level\"&gt;level up&lt;/a&gt;.\nMultiple pre-made classes can be chosen from a list, or a custom class can be created. Players uncertain about which class to take may have the option to take a brief test, which allows the player to select a class for them based on their answers. This option was first seen in and carried over to , with &lt;a href=\"Baurus\"&gt;Baurus&lt;/a&gt;' recommendation during the &lt;a href=\"Tutorial%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;tutorial&lt;/a&gt;. , unlike all titles before it, eradicated the class-structure in favor of more open-ended character customization through the allocation of perks.\nSpecialization.\nA character can specialize in Stealth, Combat, or Magic.\nOther classes.\nA player can create a custom class by selecting the specialization (Combat, Magic, Stealth), the two main attributes, and seven skills. The player may name the class whatever they want and assign any skills/attributes to it. The most common mixed classes are the Battlemage and the Stealthmage. These are mixes between the Warrior and the Mage class, and the Stealth and the Mage class. Stealth - Warrior classes are quite rare."}
{"id": "131413", "revid": "28124397", "url": "https://elderscrolls.fandom.com/wiki?curid=131413", "title": "Classes (Arena)", "text": "Classes in help determine the starting &lt;a href=\"Attributes%20%28Arena%29\"&gt;attributes&lt;/a&gt; of the &lt;a href=\"Eternal%20Champion\"&gt;Eternal Champion&lt;/a&gt;, what equipment they can or can not use and whether or not they can cast &lt;a href=\"Spells%20%28Arena%29\"&gt;spells&lt;/a&gt;. Classes can be either selected or generated by the player during &lt;a href=\"Character%20Creation%20%28Arena%29\"&gt;character creation&lt;/a&gt;. If generated, the player will be asked ten preset questions to decide which class will be picked, although the choice can be changed if desired.\nThere are a total of 18 classes in \"Arena\", with 6 \"subclasses\" being divided into 3 main groups.\nWarrior classes.\nWarriors and their subclasses are the strong arm of the Empire. They are versatile and useful in most situations, since there is no question that any problem can be solved with a sword. Unless otherwise specified, Warriors and their subclasses cannot ever cast spells. The governing statistics for warriors and their subclasses are Strength and Endurance. A high Agility is also desirable, since this directly affects their Armor Rating.\nNone of the Warrior classes can cast spells.\nWarriors.\nWarriors are the basic stock of the world of Tamriel. They are a versatile character, able to employ their skill at arms in almost any situation. They may use any weapon, armor, or shield. With the exception of Knights and Rangers, Warriors are the only other class able to wear plate armor. This fact is important, for only plate armor is strong enough to be enchanted. Therefore, only Warriors, Knights and Rangers may wear enchanted armor. Warriors are the second fastest to rise in experience, Thieves being the fastest. At high levels, this, along with the use of magical equipment, puts them in equal standing with Mages and their ilk.\nKnights.\nKnights are the fighters of the noble class. They are well schooled in the ways of chivalry and conduct themselves with honor and dignity. Knights may use any weapon, wear any armor except for leather, and use any shields. In addition, because of a Knight's innate strength of character, they are immune to paralysis, whether they be carried by spells or poison. They also have the ability to repair damaged weapons or armor. This ability is done automatically to any weapons or armor in their inventory. Knights and the other Warrior subclasses do not rise in experience as quickly as a Warrior.\nRangers.\nRangers are woodsmen and hunters, adept at tracking, survival, and pathfinding. Rangers may wear any armor up to and including plate armor, and use any weapon. Rangers because of their skills at tracking and survival automatically decrease their traveling time between cities. In addition, Rangers do extra damage equivalent to their level to their opponents.\nArchers.\nArchers are the marksmen of the Empire, adept at using any missile weapon during melee. They may wear any armor up to and including chain, and use any weapon. They may not use shields. Archers have a chance of causing a critical strike upon a target per experience level when using any missile weapon (longbow or shortbow). A critical strike equals 3x the normal damage caused for the weapon used.\nMonks.\nMonks use the discipline of their mind to hone their bodies into lethal killing machines. Monks may not wear armor or use shields, but may use any weapon they prefer. Monks have a chance per level of experience to deliver a critical strike (3x damage) when engaged with an opponent. They do not have this ability with missile weapons. Further, Monks deduct from their opponents base chance to hit for each level of experience they have attained. Because of their mental discipline, Monks can actually reduce the amount of damage they would normally take. If they successfully save versus a spell, it will result in no damage, as opposed to the normal result of taking half damage.\nBarbarians.\nBarbarians are warriors who have learned to fight in order to survive the harsh life of their homeland. Barbarians may wear armor up to and including Chain, and may use any weapon or shield. Barbarians begin with the most hit points of any character class. Because of their hardy upbringing, Barbarians have a natural immunity to poison. Barbarians, because of their incredible physique, heal additional health points based upon their endurance.\nMage classes.\nWizards and their subclasses use and manipulate the essence of magic. They are, at high levels, some of the most powerful characters available to play, mainly because of the wide variety of spells they can employ. Wizards and their subclasses use Intelligence and Willpower as their governing statistics.\nAll of the Mage classes can cast spells.\nMages.\nMages are born and bred for manipulating magic. They may not wear armor or use shields. They may however use a limited assortment of weapons. They depend upon spells for offensive and defensive power. Mages have 2x their INT in spell points.\nSorcerors.\nSorcerers are a strange breed of magic users. They are those born with the potential of casting spells, but with no power to generate spell points internally. This does not make them any less powerful; in fact Sorcerers have the potential to be the most powerful of all the Mage classes. This is because of the unique way in which they manipulate magic. Sorcerers absorb spell points from spells that are targeted at them. Sorcerers may absorb up to 3x their INT in spell points. If a spell is absorbed, the Sorcerer takes no damage, but instead adds the spell's total power points, divided by the Sorcerer's level, to their own spell points. These points are permanent until used. If a Sorcerer fails to absorb a directed spell, they take the normal effects, whatever they may be. Sorcerers do not regenerate spell points and they do not absorb points from their own spells. If a Sorcerer has absorbed spell points to his/her maximum, they will be unable to absorb more spells, and will take damage from spells just as any other character. Regardless of these restrictions they have the ability to cast more powerful spells because when they are fully charged, they have more spell points than any other Mage class. They can therefore cast more powerful spells at lower levels, provided that the spell is in their spellbook. Sorcerers have a wide selection of weapons and armor, but cannot use shields. Without a charge of spell points, they would quickly succumb to attacks if they did not practice defending themselves.\nHealers.\nHealers are mages dedicated to treating injuries and helping those in need. Their powers tend to be powerful in a defensive nature, and weak in an offensive nature. Healers have an increased base healing rate. Certain defensive spell effects in the Spellmaker are cheaper for a healer to purchase. Healers have 1.75x their INT in spell points.\nBattlemages.\nBattlemages are mages trained and bred to manipulate the essence of magic in battle. They are highly skilled at delivering offensive spells at their targets. They have 1.75x their INT in spell points. Certain offensive spell effects in the Spellmaker are cheaper for a Battle Mage to purchase. In combat, a trained Battle Mage has few equals.\nSpellswords.\nSpellswords are those few mages who have found that they have a unique ability cast spells while in armor or using weapons. They are warrior-mages, dedicating their lives to learning not only the arts of war, but the ethereal ways of power. They may use any weapon, almost any armor, and any shield except for the tower shield. Spellswords, because of their dedication to learning both arts, receive only 1.5x their INT in spell points. This is more than made up for by their versatility in combat and their increased starting hit points.\nNightblades.\nNightblades are those mages who have perfected their arts to help in activities involving infiltration, spying, and stealth. They are much like thieves, creatures of the night, able to use their considerable powers to help them in their nocturnal activities. In combat, Nightblades receive a chance per level of scoring a critical hit (3x damage). Nightblades can pick locks about as well as Rogues. They also receive 1.5x their INT in starting spell points.\nThief classes.\nAlthough all thieves and thief sub-classes have the ability to pick locks, pick pockets, and steal items, various classes have certain advantages or disadvantages in these areas. The governing statistics for all thief classes are Agility and Intelligence. A high Speed rating is also very desirable.\nOnly one of the Thief classes can cast spells; the Bard.\n&lt;a href=\"Thief\"&gt;Thieves&lt;/a&gt;.\nQuick, agile, cunning, Thieves use agility and speed to steal for a living. They are useful in combat to surprise the enemy, scout, or try for critical hits. Thieves have a chance per level of experience to score a critical hit when attacking an opponent. A critical hit is defined as 3x the damage the weapon normally does. Thieves are the fastest to rise in experience levels. They start with 25 health points plus a d10 in health. Thieves have the ability to pick locks and pockets. This ability increases as the Thief increases in levels.\n&lt;a href=\"Burglar\"&gt;Burglar&lt;/a&gt;s.\nBurglars are adept at picking locks and infiltrating different areas. They do this better than any other class, honing their skills to be able to find ways into areas thought inaccessible. They are very useful when exploring new dungeons, palaces, or other areas where others may be stopped by locked doors and/or chests. Because of the delicate nature of their work, they are restricted in the armor they may wear and the weapons they may carry. They may not use shields. Burglars also receive a chance per level to score a critical strike (3x damage) when attacking an opponent, though they are not as adept at this as Thieves.\n&lt;a href=\"Assassin\"&gt;Assassin&lt;/a&gt;s.\nAssassins are the dark hand of the night, their skills honed to the killing of others. They are very adept at this, able to find weak points or critical areas to strike, often felling opponents much more powerful than themselves. Assassins have the greatest chance per level to score a critical hit (3x damage) when attacking. Because of their training, Assassins have a wide variety of weapons from which to pick, but because of their need for stealth, they are not allowed to wear armor greater than leather or allowed to use shields.\nRogues.\nRogues are thieves who have also trained in using arms and armor. They have combined the agile and cunning of their brethren with the skill of arms found in warriors. This makes them formidable and versatile. They are comparable in combat to the warrior class but still retain the ability to pick locks and pockets. Rogues may wear up to chain armor and use any weapon or shield, with the exception of the Tower Shield. Rogues have a slight chance per level to critical strike an opponent (3x damage).\nAcrobats.\nAcrobats are thieves who have honed their physical skills in agility and balance to such a degree that they are almost supernaturally adept at scaling walls, running, jumping, and tumbling. They retain the ability to score a critical hit. They also have the ability to leap great distances and climb walls more securely and faster than the average thief. They are, in general, the fastest characters on foot. Further, because of their nimbleness, Acrobats deduct a certain percentage from their opponent's base chance to hit when engaged in combat with them. This makes them difficult foes to hit, and dangerous adversaries. Because of their need for agility and speed, Acrobats use only leather armor, but never shields, and have a reasonable selection of weapons.\nBards.\nBards are the proverbial 'Jack of all Trades.' They are able to perform many tasks, including but not limited to: critical strikes, weapons skill, picking locks/pockets, and magic. They are a very versatile class, able to take up slack in almost any situation. Bards receive an amount equal to their INT in spell points. They have a wide selection of weapons, may wear armor up to chain, and use any shield except the Tower Shield. A Bard's critical strike capability is useful when cornered by stronger opponents, though their chance to score is not as great as Thieves and the others in this subclass."}

Ask any thief. The thief is the most versatile criminal class, capable of any skulduggery and sham. For thiefly skills, a high &lt;a href=\"Agility%20%28Daggerfall%29\"&gt;Agility&lt;/a&gt; is essential, and &lt;a href=\"Intelligence%20%28Daggerfall%29\"&gt;Intelligence&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Speed%20%28Daggerfall%29\"&gt;Speed&lt;/a&gt; are also very important. A freelance thief may find the tide of the law overwhelming, but a member of the &lt;a href=\"Thieves%20Guild%20%28Daggerfall%29\"&gt;Thieves Guild&lt;/a&gt; will have evened the odds. Of course, working against the odds is often the very spice the thief desires.\n&lt;a href=\"Burglar%20%28Daggerfall%29\"&gt;Burglars&lt;/a&gt;.\nA good burglar can strip a palace to its foundations without waking a soul. Let the vulgar delinquents mug and kill for their gold - the burglar is agile, silent, and curious as a cat. Sometimes it is the challenge of a supposedly insurmountable lock or a tireless guard that sets their blood to burn. More often, it is simple greed. High &lt;a href=\"Agility%20%28Daggerfall%29\"&gt;Agility&lt;/a&gt;, sharp &lt;a href=\"Intelligence%20%28Daggerfall%29\"&gt;Intelligence&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Speed%20%28Daggerfall%29\"&gt;Speed&lt;/a&gt; mark the successful &lt;a href=\"Burglar\"&gt;Burglar&lt;/a&gt;.\n&lt;a href=\"Assassin%20%28Daggerfall%29\"&gt;Assassins&lt;/a&gt;.\nThis is the business-like attitude of the assassin: we are the merchants whose commodity is death. Cold-blooded and efficient, the assassin is trained to find weakness and to commit murder for a profit. The &lt;a href=\"Dark%20Brotherhood%20%28Daggerfall%29\"&gt;Dark Brotherhood&lt;/a&gt; is largely composed of assassins, and casts a hostile eye on freelancers in the field. Still, a strong, &lt;a href=\"Agility%20%28Daggerfall%29\"&gt;agile&lt;/a&gt;, and quickfooted solo assassin can have a long, bloody, and lucrative career.\n&lt;a href=\"Rogue%20%28Daggerfall%29\"&gt;Rogues&lt;/a&gt;.\nEqual parts thief and warrior, rogues do not avoid combat like most other thiefly classes. After all, it is often efficacious to beat a few heads to get to the gold. To this end, rogues are trained in a variety of weapons in addition to their thiefly skills. A strong arm is as important as nimble fingers to a rogue, and speedy feet may be most important of all. No one gets in and out of as much trouble as a rogue.\n&lt;a href=\"Acrobat%20%28Daggerfall%29\"&gt;Acrobats&lt;/a&gt;.\nAn experienced acrobat is as difficult to hit or hold as a drop of quicksilver. Dexterous to a superhuman degree, acrobats are remarkable leapers, climbers and dodgers, runners and tumblers. Not surprisingly, &lt;a href=\"Agility%20%28Daggerfall%29\"&gt;Agility&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Speed%20%28Daggerfall%29\"&gt;Speed&lt;/a&gt; are the most important attributes for acrobats.\n&lt;a href=\"Bard%20%28Daggerfall%29\"&gt;Bards&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe common bard seen entertaining in taverns is a wandering storyteller, a singer, a dancer, an all-around performer. Some who have mastered these diverse skills have taken to enterprises other than amusement. The bard may be considered a \"jack of all trades,\" for, in addition to the traditional thiefly skills, bards are trained in social and magical skills. Agility and Intelligence are essential for all bards.\n&lt;a href=\"Warrior%20%28Daggerfall%29\"&gt;Warriors&lt;/a&gt;.\nIn a sense, the warrior is the standard against which all classes are judged in terms of strength and versatility. As the name suggests, the warrior's milieu is physical combat. They are the ultimate fighters - capable of using any weapon, any armor, and any shield. Strength and Endurance are the most essential attributes for warriors, though agility is also an important factor in combat.\n&lt;a href=\"Knight%20%28Daggerfall%29\"&gt;Knights&lt;/a&gt;.\nKnights are the warriors elite, but their sphere is not warfare alone. They are men and women of honor and breeding, the force of chivalry in a savage land. Like warriors, knights have high Strength and Endurance, but they rely on their high personalities in social situations.\n&lt;a href=\"Ranger%20%28Daggerfall%29\"&gt;Rangers&lt;/a&gt;.\nEven as civilization slowly wins its battle with the wilderness, the woodland warriors of &lt;a href=\"Tamriel\"&gt;Tamriel&lt;/a&gt;, the rangers, are unchallenged in their environment. Rangers are hardy savages. They are supremely adaptive fighting men and women, sometimes guardians of the forest, sometimes protectors of travelers. Whatever the individual goal, it behooves a ranger to have great Strength and Endurance.\n&lt;a href=\"Archer%20%28Daggerfall%29\"&gt;Archers&lt;/a&gt;.\nArchers are specialist warriors whose weapon of choice is the bow. Warriors who prefer close melee have called the archer's long-distance attack dishonorable, but to the archer, efficiency is most important. They cannot waste their arrow shots as conventional warriors can waste their strikes. High strength gives arrows more power, but high agility is even more important for the archer.\n&lt;a href=\"Monk%20%28Daggerfall%29\"&gt;Monks&lt;/a&gt;.\nMonks owe their martial artistry to their superhuman mental discipline. Their bodies and the weapons they wield are one, and such confining annoyances as shields and armor merely get in the way. Many monks even choose to reject conventional weapons, relying on their hands and feet alone to devastating effect. Strength, Endurance, and Willpower are important attributes for monks.\n&lt;a href=\"Barbarian%20%28Daggerfall%29\"&gt;Barbarians&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe true savage warriors of Tamriel, barbarians hail from the wastelands, where only the strongest and hardiest survive. What they may be lacking in social finesse, barbarians more than counterbalance with their battle prowess. Barbarians have very high Strength and Endurance, and the highest starting health bonus of any standard character class.\n&lt;a href=\"Mage%20%28Daggerfall%29\"&gt;Mages&lt;/a&gt;.\nThaumaturgists, Mystics, Enchanters, Conjurers - all great specialist spellcasters are, at their core, Mages. Mages spend years studying the six schools of magicka, combining and juxtaposing them to create effects beyond the ken. Intelligence is important for mages, as their spells are powered by magicka \"pools\" based on intelligence. A high Willpower is necessary for spells to be successfully cast.\n&lt;a href=\"Sorcerer%20%28Daggerfall%29\"&gt;Sorcerers&lt;/a&gt;.\nSorcerers are much like Mages, but with important differences. They do not regenerate magicka naturally within their bodies, but absorb it from the spells of other. Their total magicka \"pool\" is greater than the mage's - indeed, they have the greatest magical potential of the standard character classes. Like their brother mages, sorcerers must have high Intelligence and a high Willpower.\n&lt;a href=\"Healer%20%28Daggerfall%29\"&gt;Healers&lt;/a&gt;.\nA sub-set of Mages, healers are specialists in the School of &lt;a href=\"Restoration%20%28Daggerfall%29\"&gt;Restoration&lt;/a&gt;. Their powers tend to be very strong for defense, but weaker in offense. High Intelligence and Willpower are essential for healers, as they are for all spellcasters.\n&lt;a href=\"Battlemage%20%28Daggerfall%29\"&gt;Battlemages&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe antithesis of the healer is the Battlemage, whose credo comes form the School of &lt;a href=\"Destruction%20%28Daggerfall%29\"&gt;Destruction&lt;/a&gt;. Offensive spells come naturally to battlemages, as defensive spells come to healers. Intelligence and Willpower are important attributes for battlemages.\n&lt;a href=\"Spellsword%20%28Daggerfall%29\"&gt;Spellswords&lt;/a&gt;.\nSpellswords are the warrior-mages of &lt;a href=\"Tamriel\"&gt;Tamriel&lt;/a&gt;, a powerful class able to draw on both the inexplicable forces of magicka and the less exotic, more dependable weaponry. There are few men and women more versatile than spellswords. The class demands are not only high &lt;a href=\"Intelligence%20%28Daggerfall%29\"&gt;Intelligence&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Willpower%20%28Daggerfall%29\"&gt;Willpower&lt;/a&gt;, but high &lt;a href=\"Strength%20%28Daggerfall%29\"&gt;Strength&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Endurance%20%28Daggerfall%29\"&gt;Endurance&lt;/a&gt;.\n&lt;a href=\"Nightblade%20%28Daggerfall%29\"&gt;Nightblades&lt;/a&gt;.\nPossibly the most feared class of all is the nightblade. They possess many of the skills and philosophy of the thiefly classes, combined with the powers of the mage. Their natural agility and stealth, and their mastery of the School of &lt;a href=\"Illusion%20%28Daggerfall%29\"&gt;Illusion&lt;/a&gt;, means nightblades are seldom seen, though their hand is certainly felt. Effective nightblades have high agility as well as high &lt;a href=\"Intelligence%20%28Daggerfall%29\"&gt;Intelligence&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Willpower%20%28Daggerfall%29\"&gt;Willpower&lt;/a&gt;."}

Whichever class specialization is selected helps increase skills under that specialization quicker. For instance, choosing &lt;a href=\"Magic\"&gt;Magic&lt;/a&gt; causes skills such as &lt;a href=\"Destruction%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;Destruction&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"Alteration%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;Alteration&lt;/a&gt; level faster.\nAttributes.\nIn addition to this, players select two governing &lt;a href=\"Attributes%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;Attributes&lt;/a&gt;.

Unique to these mages is the bodily stamina to be armed with the thickest armor.\n&lt;a href=\"Spellsword\"&gt;Spellsword&lt;/a&gt;.\nMore nimble and athletic than the sorcerer, and better suited for spell-casting than the knight, their attacks are unpredictable. Students of combat and magic.\n&lt;a href=\"Thief%20%28Class%29\"&gt;Thief&lt;/a&gt;.\nProfiting from the losses of others is their love. Able to be swift in shadow, and crafty in bartering. Locks are enemies, and lock-picks are their swords.\n&lt;a href=\"Warrior%20%28Class%29\"&gt;Warrior&lt;/a&gt;.\nUnafraid of light weaponry, they plow into the fray with little regard for injury. Masters of all melee tools, they put little faith in the magical arts.\n&lt;a href=\"Witchhunter\"&gt;Witchhunter&lt;/a&gt;.\nSwift on foot and clever with spells, they use distance as their ally. Slower adversaries are fodder for their arrows, not advised to get up close with enemies of greater strength.\u00a0"}

Not as if I were a young woman merely there to refill his flagon or clear away the dirty dishes, but as someone he might actually be interested in. I don't know what to think of it.

{"id": "1764", "revid": "32911304", "url": "https://elderscrolls.fandom.com/wiki?curid=1764", "title": "Clavicus Vile", "text": "Clavicus Vile (in &lt;a href=\"Daedric%20script\"&gt;Daedric script&lt;/a&gt;, ), also known as the child-god of the Morningstar, Master of Insidious Wishes, and the Prince of Bargains\"', is one of the seventeen &lt;a href=\"Daedric%20Princes\"&gt;Daedric Princes&lt;/a&gt;. He is best known for granting wishes and entering into pacts with mortals. He is the Daedric Prince of Power, Trickery, Wishes, Serenity, and Bargains. His plane of Oblivion is known as &lt;a href=\"The%20Fields%20of%20Regret\"&gt;The Fields of Regret&lt;/a&gt;.\nInvocation.\nThe summoning date of Clavicus Vile is 1st of &lt;a href=\"Morning%20Star\"&gt;Morning Star&lt;/a&gt;. Clavicus most often takes the form of a small, impish man, with a pair of horns, though he has also manifested as a red mist.\nPersonality.\nClavicus' dealings with &lt;a href=\"Mundus\"&gt;Mundus&lt;/a&gt; are usually with individuals who wish to have something and, by summoning him, Clavicus gives it to them. However, he is known to take back his deals at inopportune times (for the summoner, not Vile). He loves toying with mortals, generally for his own entertainment rather than for any particular purpose, and has been said to be fond of mortals' souls. This has lead some to believe he is, unlike many other Daedric Princes, a deeply social being.\nClavicus has been known to split off portions of himself to create sentient objects or entities. While the permanent binding of spirits into objects is the usual process of creating &lt;a href=\"Daedric%20Artifacts\"&gt;Daedric Artifacts&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Lesser%20Daedra\"&gt;Lesser Daedra&lt;/a&gt;, Vile's creations have shown more independence than those of most other Daedra's creations. It has been theorized that these creations serve, in part, to meet a desire for companionship the Daedric Prince has. These independent fragments are discussed below.\nBarbas.\nBarbas is a shapeshifting &lt;a href=\"Daedra\"&gt;Daedra&lt;/a&gt; who houses a significant proportion of Vile's power. He most often takes the form of a dog, but has been known to appear as a &lt;a href=\"Scamp\"&gt;Scamp&lt;/a&gt; called &lt;a href=\"Creeper\"&gt;Creeper&lt;/a&gt;. It is possible that Barbas has a degree of precognition, as he warned that returning the &lt;a href=\"Umbra%20Sword\"&gt;Umbra Sword&lt;/a&gt; to Vile would bring trouble to his realm, foreshadowing Umbra's escape and the creation of the floating city &lt;a href=\"Umbriel\"&gt;Umbriel&lt;/a&gt;. Despite being of use to Vile, Barbas has been known to bore or annoy the Prince, driving him to abandon Barbas in the Fourth Era.\nUmbra.\nOriginally created as the Umbra Sword, Umbra is either a part of Vile that gained its own sentience within the sword, by accident or design, or a being that Vile somehow trapped within the sword. It ultimately broke free of Vile's will, creating a body for itself but remaining trapped within Vile's Realm. In order to escape, it forged a pact with the &lt;a href=\"Dunmer\"&gt;Dunmer&lt;/a&gt; mage &lt;a href=\"Vuhon\"&gt;Vuhon&lt;/a&gt;, providing the power necessary to create the floating city Umbriel.\nArtifacts.\nThanks to his penchant for deals and gifts with mortals, Vile has a large number of &lt;a href=\"Daedric%20Artifacts\"&gt;Daedric Artifacts&lt;/a&gt; associated with him. These are listed below.\nBitter Cup.\nThe Bitter Cup is an artifact associated with Clavicus Vile, and is known for being highly sacred to his followers. It was believed lost in the ruins of &lt;a href=\"Ald%20Redaynia\"&gt;Ald Redaynia&lt;/a&gt;. It is possible that it was recovered by the &lt;a href=\"Nerevarine\"&gt;Nerevarine&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;a href=\"Third%20Era\"&gt;Third Era&lt;/a&gt;.\nFeyfolken.\nA piece of fiction written by &lt;a href=\"Waughin%20Jarth\"&gt;Waughin Jarth&lt;/a&gt; which tells the story of a scribe and an enchanted quill. The scribe had been having trouble selling his stories to his employers and was not making any money; in a last-ditch effort to making things better for himself, he took his quill to some mages who offered to enchant the pen. They infused the quill with the spirit of a Daedra called Feyfolken, who was, unbeknownst to everyone there, a servant of Clavicus Vile. Since the quill had been enchanted, it gave great benefit to the Scribe, but sooner or later Feyfolken got into the Scribe's head and drove him insane, and even convinced the man to take his own life. When that finally happened, Clavicus took the enchanted quill, along with the Scribe's soul.\nMasque of Clavicus Vile.\nOriginally made from a deal between Vile and a disfigured noblewoman, the Masque makes its wearer more persuasive, and has been seen around &lt;a href=\"Tamriel\"&gt;Tamriel&lt;/a&gt; throughout the &lt;a href=\"Third%20Era\"&gt;Third&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Fourth%20Era\"&gt;Fourth Era&lt;/a&gt;s.\nRueful Axe.\nThe Rueful Axe was allegedly given to a wizard named Sebastian Lort, who asked Vile for a way to cure his daughter's lycanthropy. It later found its way into Vile's possession as a gift for his champions.\nUmbra Sword.\nThe Umbra Sword was created by &lt;a href=\"Naenra%20Waerr\"&gt;Naenra Waerr&lt;/a&gt; to trap souls, at Clavicus Vile's request. As part of the creation process, Vile imbued it with part of his essence. Over time, the part of Vile within the sword became a sentient being with its own will, calling itself &lt;a href=\"Umbra\"&gt;Umbra&lt;/a&gt;. Eventually, Umbra broke free of the sword, creating a body for itself. A fragment of Vile may remain attached to the sword, meaning it still traps souls even in Umbra's absence.\nHistory.\nSecond Era.\nN'Gasta and Cyrus.\nCirca &lt;a href=\"2E%20896\"&gt;2E 896&lt;/a&gt;, Clavicus is recorded dealing with N'Gasta, the &lt;a href=\"Sload\"&gt;Sload&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Necromancer\"&gt;Necromancer&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"Stros%20M%27kai\"&gt;Stros M'kai&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href=\"N%27Gasta%21%20Kvata%21%20Kvakis%21\"&gt;N'Gasta&lt;/a&gt; created \"Soulsnare,\" which gathered lost souls. The Daedric Prince Clavicus Vile granted N'Gasta favors with every soul sent to him. &lt;a href=\"Cyrus%20%28Redguard%29\"&gt;Cyrus&lt;/a&gt; the &lt;a href=\"Redguard\"&gt;Redguard&lt;/a&gt; hero, in his desperate quest to find his sister, managed to destroy N'Gasta by using the Flask of Lillandril. Using &lt;a href=\"N%27Gasta%21%20Kvata%21%20Kvakis%21\"&gt;N'Gasta's necromancy book&lt;/a&gt;, he performed a ritual to transport himself to Clavicus' realm in &lt;a href=\"Oblivion%20%28Realm%29\"&gt;Oblivion&lt;/a&gt;.\nIn order to make a gate to Oblivion appear, Cyrus had to mix &lt;a href=\"Orc\"&gt;Orc&lt;/a&gt;'s blood with &lt;a href=\"Amber\"&gt;Amber&lt;/a&gt; (jacinth \u2013 rising sun), mix the &lt;a href=\"Unicorn%20Horn\"&gt;Unicorn's horn&lt;/a&gt; with &lt;a href=\"Hist%20Sap\"&gt;Hist Sap&lt;/a&gt; (snow \u2013 grass), mix the &lt;a href=\"Daedra%20Heart\"&gt;Daedra's heart&lt;/a&gt; with &lt;a href=\"Ectoplasm\"&gt;Ectoplasm&lt;/a&gt; (night - mid-day sky) and then poured the mixtures on the symbol in the center of the N'Gasta's room, in that order. Then a gate appeared. Cyrus went through the gate and was taken to Clavicus' realm.\nThere he dealt with Clavicus, who was the holder of his sister's soul. Expecting to get back his sister's soul, Cyrus gave the Flask of &lt;a href=\"Lillandril\"&gt;Lillandril&lt;/a&gt;, but instead Clavicus returned with a riddle. If Cyrus could answer it he might get back his sister's soul, but if he failed Cyrus' own soul would be Clavicus'. Cyrus answered him correctly and retrieved his sister's soul.\nThird Era.\nHero of Daggerfall.\nThe masque was owned by the &lt;a href=\"Agent\"&gt;Agent&lt;/a&gt; of Daggerfall, sometime around the year &lt;a href=\"3E%20410\"&gt;3E 410&lt;/a&gt;. Vile asked the hero to slay a certain werewolf. After the deed was done, the hero was rewarded with the masque.\nThe Hero of Kvatch and Umbra.\nCirca &lt;a href=\"3E%20433\"&gt;3E 433&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"Hero%20of%20Kvatch\"&gt;Hero of Kvatch&lt;/a&gt; approached the &lt;a href=\"Shrine%20of%20Clavicus%20Vile\"&gt;Shrine of Clavicus Vile&lt;/a&gt; and managed to deal with the Prince. Clavicus asked the champion to procure &lt;a href=\"Umbra\"&gt;Umbra&lt;/a&gt;.\nClavicus claimed that the sword contains the soul of a hero he had been dealing with sometime before, and wanted to finish it. For procuring Umbra, Clavicus offered his Masque to the champion.\nThe hound statue of Clavicus jumped into the champion's bag, and introduced itself as Barbas. It claimed that it would be best if Clavicus were not to receive the sword from the champion at all. Somehow returning the Umbra Sword to Clavicus would be a mistake, likely to cause great ruin to Clavicus' domain. Barbas also states that whenever Clavicus deals with Umbra, nothing good comes of it.\nVampires.\nThe \"&lt;a href=\"Manifesto%20Cyrodiil%20Vampyrum\"&gt;Manifesto Cyrodiil Vampyrum&lt;/a&gt;\" notes that Clavicus altered the &lt;a href=\"Vampire\"&gt;Vampire&lt;/a&gt; blood of the &lt;a href=\"Cyrodiil%20Vampyrum%20Order\"&gt;Cyrodilic vampires&lt;/a&gt;, enabling them to walk in daylight, and more importantly, blend into mortal society undetected, and rule it from within\u2014if they were well fed. The details of the contract forged between Vile and the Vampyrum Order is unknown.\nFourth Era.\n&lt;a href=\"Umbriel%20Crisis\"&gt;Umbriel Crisis&lt;/a&gt;.\nSometime prior to &lt;a href=\"4E%2040\"&gt;4E 40&lt;/a&gt;, Umbra stole a part of Vile and negotiated with the &lt;a href=\"Dunmer\"&gt;Dunmer&lt;/a&gt; mage &lt;a href=\"Vuhon\"&gt;Vuhon&lt;/a&gt; to create &lt;a href=\"Umbriel\"&gt;Umbriel&lt;/a&gt;, a floating city, out of a fragment of Vile's realm. This allowed Umbra to escape Vile's grasp.\n&lt;a href=\"Sul\"&gt;Sul&lt;/a&gt; and prince &lt;a href=\"Attrebus%20Mede\"&gt;Attrebus&lt;/a&gt; retrieved the sword &lt;a href=\"Umbra\"&gt;Umbra&lt;/a&gt; to defeat Vuhon and save &lt;a href=\"Tamriel\"&gt;Tamriel&lt;/a&gt; from the threat of Umbriel, but were instead trapped in &lt;a href=\"Sathil%20%28Village%29\"&gt;Sathil&lt;/a&gt; castle's dungeons by &lt;a href=\"Nirai%20Sathil\"&gt;Nirai Sathil&lt;/a&gt;. Sul sensed that Umbra could be used to open a portal to the realm of Clavicus Vile. \nThe Daedric Prince decided to save the two the trouble, however, summoning them to The Fields of Regret before they could attempt to use Umbra. There they were greeted by &lt;a href=\"Barbas\"&gt;Barbas,&lt;/a&gt; who guided them to Vile where he demanded that Sul hand over Umbra to him. Instead Sul offered a contract, offering to stop Umbriel and return it to Vile's plane. The Prince of Bargains attempted to further leverage the deal, to which Sul offered up his soul, but was stopped by Attrebus before he could finish his proposal. Attrebus told Vile that their agreement would be unconditional, as the Daedric Prince was in need of their help as much as they were in need of his. Vile accepted, and sent the to to his &lt;a href=\"Clavicus%20Vile%27s%20Shrine\"&gt;shrine&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Cyrodiil\"&gt;Cyrodiil&lt;/a&gt;.\nAttrebus and Sul managed to enter &lt;a href=\"Umbriel\"&gt;Umbriel&lt;/a&gt; where, once inside, &lt;a href=\"Mere-Glim\"&gt;Mere-Glim&lt;/a&gt; guided them to the &lt;a href=\"ingenium\"&gt;ingenium&lt;/a&gt; which Atrrebus destroyed using Umbra. Immediately afterwards, Attrebus was possessed by Clavicus Vile, who had decided to cut out the middle man to reclaim Umbra.\nSul prayed to Vile for Attrebus\u2019 release, but the Daedric Prince demanded a sacrifice. Sul instead decided to approach Vile with an alternative solution: Violence. Vile returned in kind, stabbing him with Umbra, and with his last breath, Sul remembered the fury that had driven him for forty years and grabbed the hilt of Umbra. He pulled himself up the blade, and with everything left in him he struck Attrebus in the jaw. Attrebus dropped the sword, and Vile was expelled from his body.r\n&lt;a href=\"Dragon%20Crisis\"&gt;The Dragon Crisis&lt;/a&gt;.\nBarbas was estranged from Clavicus Vile in &lt;a href=\"4E%20201\"&gt;4E 201&lt;/a&gt;, and sought out the Last Dragonborn to unite him with Vile. The pair then traveled to &lt;a href=\"Haemar%27s%20Shame\"&gt;Haemar's Shame&lt;/a&gt;, which was occupied by worshipers of Vile who had been plagued with vampirism. After disposing of the vampires, Vile then asks the Dragonborn to retrieve the &lt;a href=\"Rueful%20Axe\"&gt;Rueful Axe&lt;/a&gt;. Clavicus offers the axe to the Dragonborn in exchange for killing Barbas. If they do not, Clavicus will give his mask to them; if they do so, Clavicus claims Barbas should have \"picked a better friend.\" Barbas will become part of the statue no matter which option the Dragonborn chooses.\nPopular opinion and worship.\nDespite his reputation as a trickster spirit, Vile is one of the more popular and tolerated Princes among the denizens of Tamriel. He is known for receiving veneration from merchants, traders, bankers, politicians, and bureaucrats, and while he doesn't appear in any of the Tamrielic pantheons, his worship is most prominent in High Rock, Cyrodiil, and Elsweyr. Many mortals believe it is unwise to make deals with Prince Clavicus, and while this is a fair affirmation to make, the Daedra has been known to keep his word on occasion. In the case of Cyrus the Redguard, when he traveled to the Fields of Regret, Vile gave him the opportunity to win his sister's soul back, provided he answer a riddle. During the Third Era, when Uriel VII still reigned over Tamriel as Emperor, the Elder Council were known to forge covenants with Lord Vile, although they were warned against drinking from the Bittercup."}

As a young girl, she was grossly disfigured by a spiteful servant. Avalea made a dark deal with Clavicus Vile and received the masque in return.

Apparently Zeira thinks someone sold the guild out to the &lt;a href=\"Iron%20Wheel\"&gt;Iron Wheel&lt;/a&gt;. \nHead over to Zeira and talk to her. She will tell you that she thinks someone named Velsa is the traitor. Velsa retired from the guild just before the dowry heist that alerted the Iron Wheel to the Thieves Guild. Zeira will want to meet you outside the city walls to discuss things further. Head southeast of Abah's Landing, to the breach in the city's walls. When you arrive there, you will see an Iron Wheel soldier stumble out; he will die here, and Zeira will find a note on his body. Speak with her and she will tell you what the note says: Velsa is not working with the Iron Wheel, she is their next target.\nZeira will tell you to go and warn Velsa while she returns to the guild. Head ahead and through the crack in the wall to reach the Abandoned House. Leave the house through the front door, then head east. Proceed through the labyrinthe of structures ahead, fighting the Iron Wheel along the way. Eventually, you will reach Velsa's garden. Drop down and speak with Velsa; she will not believe your good intentions, and will want you to do her a favour before she agrees to meet with Zeira. She will ask you to talk to the Khajiit standing nearby, Silver-Claw, to see what he is up to. Silver-Claw will tell you that his warehouse was taken from him by someone nefarious, and that he wants a thief to steal the ledger back. \nHead to the warehouse district. This is a restricted area, so make sure you are not seen. Head to the south of the district. There are no guards on the scaffolding, so you can use that for part of the trek, but you will eventually have to get down to the ground level. Once you have reached the far south of the area, speak with Velsa there. She will tell you to follow her instructions to the letter while the two of you are in the warehouse. \nEnter the warehouse, then talk to Velsa again. She will tell you to distract the overseer by throwing a Stink Apple at him, so that Velsa can hit him on the head. Use the stink apple when Velsa is in position. She will knock him out, then tell you to come over. Sneak past the guards and the civilians to get to the top floor, then head through the blue door. There are no guards in this next area, so you can just follow Velsa to Silver-Claw's office. Open the lock and head in. Once inside, head to the room to your left and you will find Silver-Claw's Stash on the floor. It will contain his ledger. Upon finding it, Velsa will tell you that something is coming. Hide in the basket nearby until Velsa has dealt with them. \nOnce this is done, escape out the window and head back to the Thieves Guild. You will find Silver-Claw outside; return his ledger to him, then head inside and speak with Zeira to finish the quest."}
